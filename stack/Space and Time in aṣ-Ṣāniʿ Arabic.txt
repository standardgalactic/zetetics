This study is the product of intensive fieldwork carried out in the Negev (in
southern Israel) from 2011 to 2019. The early phase of data collection, which
took place from 2011 and 2013, centered on the selection of spatial frames of
reference used in language by the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders and became the topic of my
doctoral thesis, defended in 2014 at the University of Pisa and Ben-Gurion Uni-
versity of the Negev. My interest in universalism vs. linguistic determinism and
cross-cultural relativism arose in 2010 during a course on linguistic anthropol-
ogy taught by Professor Roberto Ajello at the University of Pisa. He also trans-
mitted to me a passion for spoken languages and linguistic fieldwork. Having
obtained a doctoral position at the Department of Linguistics of the same uni-
versity, I enjoyed the extraordinary opportunity to participate in a seminar on
spatialrepresentationsledbyProfessorGiovannaMarotta,whosemethodolog-
ical insights were decisive in the discovery of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders’ referential sys-
tem. At the time, Professor Marotta was heading a project on spatial represen-
tations in Italian in which many young scholars were taking part. The themes
discussed during the seminar were manifold, and included semantic corpora
annotation, motion events, frames of reference, spatial representations among
the blind, and diachronic and synchronic analysis of prepositions in Greek,
Latin, and the Romance languages. During the seminar and the conferences
and workshops that followed, I built most of my theoretical background, while
I acquired my methodological training during a year-long stay in Indonesia
in the framework of an Erasmus Mundus program between the University of
Pisa and the Nanyang Technological University of Singapore. Very soon I was
afforded the opportunity to combine this toolbox with my previous knowledge
of Semitic languages when, during a conference at the Sde Boqer campus of
Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, professors Alexander Borg and Gideon
Kressel invited me to conduct studies on linguistic anthropology among the
local Bedouin tribes. After a brief preliminary survey among the major Negev
Bedouin groups, I decided to focus my attention on the spatial language of the
elders of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ tribe, which dwells in the village of (al-)Ligīyih, on the
northern fringes of the Negev. In the following months, thanks to professors
Roni Henkin, Giovanna Marotta, Pier Giorgio Borbone, and Alessandro Lenci,
a co-tutorship between the University of Pisa and Ben-Gurion University was
arrangedandIwasabletoconductmyresearchintheNegev,enjoyingthesame
status and facilities as local students.
The choice of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ tribe was dictated not only by the particular fea-
tures of their spatial language, but also by their generous and warm hospitality.

Living in an official, recognized village provided with state infrastructure and
acquainted with the presence of some Western scholars who had visited the
tribe in the past, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ had no objection to hosting me and cooperat-
ing with me. A crucial role in this endeavor was played by Valeria, a highly
respected Italian woman who had married a member of the tribe in the nine-
teen seventies and completely assimilated into Bedouin culture and language.
Valeria and her husband, Dr. ʿAbdelraḥmān, became my family over the years
of the project and introduced me to tribal elders from the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and the
neighboring tribes. The entire aṣ-Ṣāniʿ family, especially the ʿēlit ḥāğğ Salmān,
helped me enormously: ʿAbdelkarīm, Hāğir, Sarah, Milād, Ibrāhīm, Amal, Fāṭ-
mih, Zyād, the matriarch Niʿmih, Maryam, ʿEmād, Layla, and Samīr. I will be
always extremely grateful to all of them and many others, not only for their
cooperation, but also for their friendship, their company, and their warmth.
They made me appreciate the beauty of an ancient, rich language, and the
quintessential values of a traditional Bedouin culture that is proudly surviv-
ing in the present. I will never forget the almost one-hundred-year-old Niʿmih,
still proud of her beauty, putting kuḥl on her eyes, wearing bracelets, and don-
ning embroidered white veils. During our meetings, she showed me pictures of
the family horses, hanging on the wall over her bed, like memories of the past.
I will never forget Adam and his passion for his grandfather’s stories before
bedtime. I will not forget our visits to ʿAbdelkarīm, the eldest brother of Dr.
ʿAbdelraḥmān, at the beginning of spring, when he took his flock to graze on
the first fresh grass on the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ lands outside of Ligīyih. There he built
his seasonal tent and lived ‘the life of before’ again. On summer nights, small
wolves came close to our camp when the fire faded, attracted by the smell
of the meat, and the children were frightened and amused at the same time.
Finally, as a sign of my integration in the family, when ʿAbdelkarīm hosted
the marriage celebration for the youngest of his sons, I was invited to take
part in the last dance of the evening, the one in which the intimate relatives
gather to dance in a circle, sharing joy and support with the new couple. That
evening, I certainly had a great deal of fun, but most of all I felt that I had
been given a great honor and was immensely fortunate to have a family in the
Negev.
My frequent presence at family meetings and daily interactions enabled me
to observe many aspects of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ spatial language. I could even appre-
ciate how spatial representations changed between experimental settings and
spontaneous speech. Within spontaneous speech practices, spatial represen-
tations were constantly adapted to different styles, audiences, occasions, com-
municative scopes, and contexts. So, for example, describing the same spatial
scene to a nearby listener, a listener on the telephone, or a nearby listener

viewing the same scene constrains the quantity and the quality of the spatial
information encoded in the message and its distribution over different com-
municative modalities (speech, gaze direction, head, chin, and body signals,
hand pointing) in different ways. I could intuit the importance of the audi-
ence in the construction of a spatial message; communicating with younger
people, elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ speakers have to adapt their referential practices and
shift to other systems, renouncing, for example, the use of cardinal directions.
Indeed, middle-aged and young speakers are progressively losing competence
in cardinal orientation, with some individual exceptions. For all these obser-
vations and insights, I am deeply indebted to the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ—or the aṣ-Ṣunnāʿ,
as they collectively call themselves, for allowing me to interact with them in
private, familiar, public, and experimental contexts. Valeria and ʿAbdelraḥmān
also introduced me to other Bedouin lineages, geographically, genetically, or
socially close to the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, mainly belonging to the Gdērāt and the Tiyāha
groups. Thus, through their mediation, I was able to contact and work with
the al-ʿUgbī, the Abū-Grēnī, the aṭ-Ṭalālgih, the al-Asad, the al-Ḥğūğ, the Abū-
Kaff, the al-Hawāšlih, the al-Aṭraš, and the Abū-ʿAṣā clans. I was also able to
contact the Abū-ʿĀbid, originally slaves, integrated over many centuries into
the cliental system of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ. More recently, the Abū-Ġōrī clan became
a client of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and requested permission to dwell in a northwestern
portion of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ land, probably to find refuge from an internal tribal
feud in their original homeland. Within Ligīyih, I was also introduced to some
friends from the Maʿānīyih tribe, a group scattered across the Negev and Jor-
dan and mainly dwelling in the cities of Rahaṭ, Ksēfe, and Ligīyih. Interestingly,
I was not directly introduced by aṣ-Ṣāniʿ members to different Negev confed-
erations (Ḏ̣ ullām, ʿAzāzmih, and Tarābīn), which are geographically ‘remote,’
alien, or rather indifferent to my hosts. Nonetheless, as I was also in contact
with them, I had to inform my hosts about my relations with the other tribes, in
particular my visits to other tribal territories. The comparisons among the dif-
ferent Tiyāha groups led me to formulate an internal classification of the tribes
and lineages included in the Tiyāha confederation on the basis of their spa-
tial language and referential practices. Interestingly, the referential style varies
according to genetic affiliation, perfectly reflecting the marriage strategies that
bind the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ lineage to some close relatives while excluding other Tiyāha
groups. Furthermore, variation in spatial referential practices correlates with
other phonological and morphological interdialectal differences, contributing
to the reconstruction of the linguistic history of Negev Arabic, an enterprise
thatremainstobeundertaken.Forthesediscoveries,Iamverygratefultoallthe

The linguistic research described above was conducted over the course of
about four years. Ultimately, my PhD dissertation turned out to be restricted to
the complex analysis of a very special application of the relative frame of refer-
ence specific to the language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders. It was published in 2015 by
the University of Pisa, edited by Marotta. My interest was increasingly piqued
by the discovery of the existence of a very special linguistic referential system
among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ that uses the complete tripartite typology of frames of ref-
erence described in Levinson (2003) and is based on the ontological character-
istics culturally attributed to spatial entities. Over the next two years, I refined
my methodology and broadened my analysis, including the cross-generational
exploration of the referential system in cognition. I was able to remain close to
the tribe thanks to a post-doctoral position obtained at Ben-Gurion University
of the Negev, under the supervision of Prof. Roni Henkin, with whom I later
coauthored two articles in which we explored in depth the topic of spatial lin-
guistic representations in Negev Arabic. In the first (Cerqueglini and Henkin
2016), we analyzed the use of cardinal directions in traditional Bedouin narra-
tive, poetry, and proverbs from the Arabian focal homeland through the subse-
quent historical migrations, proving that cardinal orientation was the original,
primeval spatial system among all Arab nomads. In the second (Cerqueglini
and Henkin 2018), we established the semantic criteria according to which
elderly Negev Arabic speakers classify spatial entities and select different refer-
ential strategies in language. In line with the suggestion of Prof. Jürgen Bohne-
meyer, we called the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ semantic system ‘referentially complementary,’ as
different frames of reference appear in contrastive or complementary distribu-
tion based on spatial entities involved in the description.
Finally, in the last two years, thanks to a grant from the Israeli Science
Foundation (isf 680/17, 2017–2021), I was able to examine the referential sys-
tems of the other Negev Bedouin confederations (Ḏ̣ ullām, ʿAzāzmih, Tarābīn,
Maʿānīyīn) and sedentarized groups that orbit around the original Bedouin
in the Negev (Abū-ʿAğāğ). My exploration of spatial representations extended
over time and also covered Galilean Bedouin tribes (Wādy Sallāmah, Jisr iz-
Zārqa), mixed groups in Lod and Ramla (Central Israel), and sedentary peoples
from the Galilee and the Muṯallaṯ. I tested them linguistically and cognitively.
Some of these new data are reported in this book for purposes of comparison.
Having completed this book, I realize how many people I still have to thank
for their support at every stage to its development: Mwaffaq Abū Rabīʿih, Hiba
ʿAmmāš, Binas Ṭāhā, Amīr ʿAğmāl, and Salām ʿEydeh, crucial contact people
who helped me to find my way to the ‘best’ informants. I recall with special
affection Niʿmih and ʿAbdelraḥmān, who have since left this world. May their
memories be forever blessed. I am deeply indebted to Dr. Edoardo Cavirani and

Introduction
This book is the result of ten years of fieldwork with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Bedouin tribe
in the Negev Desert in search of their spatial and temporal representations
in language, cognition, and culture across three generational varieties: Tradi-
tional,Middle,andYoungaṣ-ṢāniʿArabic(henceforthabbreviatedastaa,maa,
and yaa respectively).
This central and conservative variety of nomadic Arabic is spoken by the aṣ-
Ṣāniʿ Bedouin tribe, which settled some four decades ago on a portion of tribal
estatesinthenortheasternfringesof theNegev.Whilefromthebroadhistorical
perspective of the Semitic linguistic family, central nomadic Arabic varieties,
which share several meaningful Central Semitic features, are thought of as foci
of morphological innovation (Goldenberg 2013), the rigorous observation of
strict endogamy and other ethnic and cultural habits and traditions seems to
have fostered within these groups the stabilization of deep semantic ground-
work structures such as those pertaining to the encoding of spatial relations.
Indeed, the Central area of the Semitic linguist world developed sociocultur-
ally and economically from the beginning of the Iron Age until Late Antiquity
along the Mediterranean-Ḥijāzi commercial axis that ran between the Ara-
bian Peninsula and the Levant. Nonetheless, while morphologically innovative
from a genealogical point of view, Peninsular and Levantine Arabic varieties
are spoken in conservative societies. This phenomenon points to the preser-
vation of cultural, linguistic and, probably, cognitive features that often stretch
back to the pre-Islamic antiquity.This is especially true for the Bedouin groups,
rigorously endogamous and tenaciously attached to their nomadic or semino-
madic lifestyle up to the threshold of modernity and, in some cases, even today.
The striking use of cardinal directions, or the geocentric frame of reference,
on a small scale in the daily language may indeed represent the retention of
an ancient feature. As recent studies show (Bohnemeyer et al. 2022), in many
traditional societies from different linguistic families, the geocentric frame of
reference was still used widely until several decades ago and has gradually dis-
appeared, first from the language of younger generations and then from their
cognition.These findings haveinduced some scholars toclaim that the geocen-
tric frame is the original panhuman strategy (Bohnemeyer et al. 2014), despite
evidence that intrinsic and relative frames have been found to be developed
early and easily in children (Danziger 2001). An early wide diffusion of geo-
centric strategies has also been shown to have taken place in Semitic, in which
cardinal directions were used frequently in the past (e.g., Biblical Hebrew, pre-
Classical and Classical Arabic, proverbs and poetic language in Modern South

Arabian, and so on), while in today’s daily speech they are no longer in fre-
quent use. In any case, the Semitic comparative data reported in the book have
no theoretical implications or impact on the hypotheses that other scholars
have formulated on the ontogenesis and phylogeny of spatial strategies. My
focus is on observing linguistic and cognitive change across three generations,
less than a hundred years of history, and examining the role of cultural and
lifestyle change in this process. Certainly, traditional Bedouin varieties may
have aspects in common with ancient languages.
The genetic, cultural, and territorial conservatism of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ ʿišīrih
(‘smalltribe’or‘largefamily’),whichledtoaninterestingandrichsetof seman-
tic strategies used to describe spatial relations among the elders (Cerqueglini
2015) and the tribe’s relatively recent transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a
sedentary one motivated me to conduct my fieldwork with them. I divided the
informants into three age groups that included men and women and repre-
sented three stages in the history of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ community within the larger
framework of the history of the Middle East and the State of Israel, i.e., three
fundamental steps along the path of cultural change.
As a biological and psychological foundation of human life, space has been
a prevalent theme in the fields of anthropology (territorial structure and set-
tlement patterns, Lévi-Strauss 1967; proxemics, Hall 1966; cosmology, Eliade
1959)andenvironmentalpsychology(Montello2008).AccordingtoKant’scon-
ception (1768), space is also considered a structural foundation of knowledge
and thinking for other, more abstract, domains such as time, causation, con-
dition, and concession (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). According to universalistic
approaches, linguistic representations are treated as truth-conditional (Svorou
1994), i.e., as representations of an ‘objective world’ that actually exists. Nev-
ertheless, the analysis of spatial linguistic representations reveals extraordi-
narily wide cross-linguistic variability. As languages differ in the ways in which
they constrain speakers in attending to and encoding different aspects of real-
ity (Slobin 1996), they may possibly lead to the existence of different kinds
of minds, psychologies, and world experiences. Linguistic relativity claims
that memory, route-finding, non-verbal communication, sensory motor activi-
ties, artistic expressions, and emotional contents could vary according to the
categories encoded in a spoken language (Jackendoff 1983; Langacker 1986).
In some languages, the spatial information has such a very pervasive pres-
ence as to be obligatorily encoded in large sets of actions (Sims and Genetti
2017).
Levinson (2003) defines spatial frames of reference as semantic and cogni-
tive strategies used to project coordinate systems onto spatial arrays. By such
means,wecanconceptualizeandlinguisticallydescribeprojective(orangular)

spatial relations between objects to be located (Figures) and object in relation
to which Figures are located (Grounds). In my research, the spatial domain was
investigated with regard to projective representations on the horizontal plane
in static and dynamic scenes in an attempt to describe how spatial frames of
reference are applied by each group of informants. I followed the typology of
referential strategies described in Bohnemeyer (2012: 18) and Bohnemeyer and
O’Meara (2012: 220). Furthermore, I investigated the semantic distinctions that
underlie the distribution of different prepositional strategies (simplex prepo-
sitions, prepositional compounds, and prepositional chains) within the repre-
sentations of each frame of reference and devised a special methodology for
their elicitation (Tick Test).
Timewasalsoinvestigatedinthisresearchcross-generationallyinitslinguis-
tic and cognitive representations, especially those related to the subdomain of
spatial sequencing, which is probably more prone to isomorphism with spatial
frames of reference, as it seems to rely across languages on spatial horizontal
axes (Boroditsky and Gaby 2010).
Special attention was given to cultural factors that determine linguistic and
cognitive choices, especially because they are embodied in culture-specific
semantic distinctions (henceforth: sememes), which remain constant between

For the first time in the history of studies on frames of reference and tem-

shed light on the trajectories of the cross-generational evolution of referential
systems, focusing on transformations in material life as catalysts of linguis-

tial strategies among the elders shows a culture-based and domain-exclusive
ontology, unpredictable outside the speakers’ community, according to which
real entities selected as Ground objects are classified for locative purposes.
Some basic aspects of this ontology were described in Cerqueglini (2015),
Cerqueglini and Henkin (2018), and Cerqueglini (2019). The youngest mem-
bers of the tribe use fewer referential strategies than the elders and select them

introduction
according to parameters that are irreversibly and qualitatively different from
the old spatial ontology and axial and functional constraints.
Beyond the well-known centrality of realia and their properties in human
spaceprocessing,thisstudyrevealsthattheattributionof featuresandontolog-
ical properties to objects in the real world can unexpectedly and significantly
differ across cultures. In this book, the categories for encoding the concep-
tual notions of space into language definitively illuminate the ways in which
physical perceptions and interactions, cognitive and linguistic processes, and
cultures are connected in the human experience of space and landscape, open-
ing the debate on the relationship between language, thought, and reality to an
unprecedented vision of grammatical embodiment.
From a philosophical point of view, the results of this exploration of lin-
guistic diversity transcend the mainstream epistemological trend imposed by
the universalism vs. determinism debate which has until now prevailed in the
panorama of domain-based approaches toward language-to-cognition corre-
lation, largely constraining the data observed across languages and cultures
within the scope of typological classifications.
Thedescriptionof theevolutionof theaṣ-Ṣāniʿspatialandtemporalreferen-
tialsystemacrossseveralgenerationsandtheelucidationof theroleof material
life and culture in this process constitutes an example of a sociostructuralist
approach borrowed by cognitive linguistic studies. This theoretical combina-
tion should be further developed with different linguistic and cultural groups
toproducecomparativedataontherelationshipsbetweenlanguage,cognition,
and culture.
This research represents a pioneering study of referential spatial and tem-
poral cognitive semantics in a Semitic language. Indeed, the theoretical outline
that emerges from the analysis of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ data, as mentioned above, may
not be generally extendable to other languages and cognitive systems. More
radically, the transferability of cognitive models across cultures and languages
—despite their historical, sociological, and geographical specificity—remains
an open question.
The historical and ecological experience of a group of Arab nomads in the
Negev sands appears in this semantic profile as a unique and exceptional
cultural elaboration that is currently vanishing rapidly and irreversibly. The
semantic description in this work is so packed with theoretical implications as
to naturally represent a nucleus for further investigations in several directions
of enquiry. Yet, in itself it represents a milestone of substantial fieldwork data
from which a completely new perspective on the human processing of spatial
and temporal domains can develop.

Aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Space and Time and a Linguist in the Field
1
General Overview
This work focuses on the linguistic coding of the domain of space and time
in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic across three generations with the objective of clarifying the
relationships between language, cognition, and culture. Studying the concep-
tion of space is both intriguing and important because it is culturally specific,
yet universally experienced, much like language and culture. For this reason,
space has been a prevalent theme in the field of anthropology, sociology, and
philosophy,andinparticularof territorialstructure(Radcliffe-Brown1940),set-
tlement patterns (Lévi-Strauss 1967), social space (Durkheim and Mauss 1963),
proxemics(Hall1966),cosmology(Eliade1959),andthesymbolismof domestic
space (Bourdieu 1977).
The tradition of linguistic studies on Bedouin Arabic is based on text col-
lections. This practice arose from a desire to document the rich cultures of the
speakers and is seen as a tool for understanding languages in their own terms
rather than through European models. Generally, the texts serve as the bases
for grammatical description, as in Alʿatāmīn (2011), Blanc (and Stewart 1970),
Henkin (2010), Marom (2012), and Shawārbah (2012). Similarly to what Ade-
laar notes regarding the documentation of South American languages (2012),
Bedouin languages and customs were first documented by European scholars
and then by local Israeli ones, and in the last two decades a native scholarship
has begun to develop.
For almost two hundred years, Bedouin communities have been the sub-
ject of numerous studies on various aspects of their special way of life, usually
from sociological, anthropological, literary, or historical perspectives (Bailey
2009; Burckhardt 1829; Doughty 1888; Kressel 1975, 1982, 1996, 1999; Kurper-
shoek 1994–2005; Lawrence 1935; Musil 1928; Stewart 1994). The present inves-
tigation considers anthropological and cultural approaches to be complemen-
tary strategies to linguistic research. According to Malinowski (1922), lexical
data cannot be fully comprehended outside their specific cultural context (cf.
Henson 1974) because an understanding of the data within the culture is a pre-
requisite for translation into other languages. With respect to the investigation
of the Bedouin spatial experience in nonlinguistic descriptions, Abu-Rabia-
Queder and Karplus (2012) in the field of sociology and gender studies, and
Kressel (1981, 1989, 1991) and Marx (1967, 2001) in the field of anthropology are

the linguistic and cognitive spatial representations in use among the Arabic-
speaking Bedouin tribes of the Negev, especially the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Bedouin ʿišīrih
(‘lineage’).
The Negev is the arid southern region of Israel, stretching from Qiryat Gat
to Ashqelon down to the Red Sea. From the physical point of view, the Negev
is included in the rocky desert mountain continuum that includes the Sinai
Peninsula to the west, the Jordanian governorates of Maʿān and ʿAqaba1 to the
east-southeast, up to the northern regions of the Arabian Peninsula. Annual
precipitation in the Negev is less than two hundred mm. This region con-
tains almost sixty percent of Israel’s land mass (approximately eleven million
dunams) (Rudnitsky and Abu Ras 2012).
If one takes Negev Arabic as a whole, this Arabic variety does not appear to
be immediately threatened with disappearance. However, the different tradi-
tional tribal varieties, one of which is the subject of this discussion, are disap-
pearing very rapidly, under the pressure of various forces: koinezation within
the Negev itself, the presence of media in other Arab varieties perceived as
more authoritative, and massive contact with Hebrew. Yet, for both social and
ideologicalreasons,thepressurefromotherArabvarietiesismuchmorethreat-
ening than the contact with Hebrew, which today remains continuously and
significantlyaccessibleonlytosmall,educatedsectorsof thepopulation.Negev
Arabic is considered part of identity among young people, who often perpetu-
ate ancestral tribal customs in their existential choices, such as whom to marry
and how to name their children. The importance of the language for identity
protects it to some extent from extinction (Woodbury 2011). But the differ-
ent tribal varieties, which attest to different settlement histories, are the ones
threatened with disappearance. This study, based on the comparison of data
from three generations of the same tribal variety, attests to the reality of this
threat.Theprocessof koinezationof thedialectsspokenbythemaintribalcon-
federations into Negev Arabic probably began in the seventieth century, and
resembles the process described by Trudgill (2011), in which contact between
1 ʿAqaba derives from the pan-Bedouin Arabic root ʿ.q.b., or ʿ.g.b. according to the Bedouin pro-
nunciation of the proto-Arabic *q.This root means ‘nape,’ from which the prepositions ‘back’
and ‘after’ are derived across Bedouin varieties. The place represents the first outlet to the
western sea for those arriving from the Arabian deserts. The meanings of ‘west,’ ‘seaside,’ and
‘back’ are strictly correlated in Bedouin cultures and languages, as the prototypical and basic
direction that one faces is east, associated with the desert inlands, the Bedouins’ homeland.
For the Bedouin, the spaces and paths of the Middle East are heavy with symbolism that links
astronomical directions, landmarks, cultural symbols, ethical and aesthetic models, and val-
ues.

mutually intelligible dialects can lead to the development of new dialects, with
dialectal variants progressively disappearing to make room for a local stan-
dard.
Prior to 1948, the Bedouin groups living in the Negev were known as ‘the
Arabs of Beer-Sheva,’ ʿarab as-sabaʿ. They called themselves ʿarab, while badū
‘Bedouin, inhabitants of the bādiya,’ i.e., of the ‘desert,’ was the term used by
farmers to refer to them. For the Bedouins, non-Bedouin Arabs are the fallaḥīn
‘farmers.’ In the pre-State period, the Bedouin led a pastoral, seminomadic life.
Nonetheless, during the nineteenth century, toward the end of the Ottoman
period, many of them had become sedentary and were involved in agriculture
and construction, trading regularly with merchants from the Gaza area (Kres-
sel et al. 1991). The city of Beer-Sheva was founded in 1900 for administrative
reasons. In order to be closer to the authorities, the Bedouin sheiks of the area
constructed homes there, and these were their first stone buildings (Parizot
2001).
In 1946, the number of Negev Bedouin was estimated at between fifty-seven
thousand and ninety-five thousand. After the 1948 conflict and the foundation
of the State of Israel, eleven thousand Bedouins remained in the Negev (Muh-
sam 1966). They were first concentrated for about three years in an enclosed
zone north-northeast of Beer-Sheva that remained under military control until
1966, and then were removed farther east (Marx 1967). The majority of
Bedouins were expelled or fled before the arrival of Israeli troops and took
refuge in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip (Henkin 2010: 31), and Sinai, accord-
ing to personal communications of my informants.
When military control ended, Bedouin towns were established in the area
around Beer-Sheva.These includedTall as-Sabaʿ (Tel Sheva) and Rahaṭ(Rahat),

Ksayfih (Ksēfe), ʿArʿarah (Arara), Sgīb as-Salām (Segev Shalom), Ḥūrah (Hura),
and Ligīyih (Laqiya).
The fate of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ was better than that of most other Bedouins, since
Ligīyih was built on their tribal land. But most of the Bedouin, whose land was
not part of the urbanized enclaves, refused to live in them, fearing the loss of
their own lands. Today, these towns are home to half of the Bedouin popula-
tion of the Negev, a population estimated at one hundred twenty thousand
people. The remainder lives in the bzorāh,2 small permanent encampments
scattered across the sandy hills and stony ridges, without state infrastructure.

It is worth remembering that before the Israeli War of Independence, other
tribal confederations living in the Negev left for Egypt and the Palestinian
Authority.These included the Ğabarāt, the Ḥwēṭāt (Palva 1984–1986; 2004), the
Saʿīdiyīn, and the Ğahāllīn, who are no longer present on the linguistic map
of the contemporary Negev (Marx 1967; Sacchi 2003; Stewart 1986). Accord-
ing to Bailey (1985), the tribes that inhabited the southern Levant during the
British Mandate began began to orbit the area in the seventeenth century,

Tribal Boundaries in the Negev. The tent symbol

from al-ʿārif (1974 [1934])
following the interests and conflicts of the European powers and attempting
to take part in them for their own benefit. But in reality, the history of the
nomadic tribes is not easy to reconstruct. The documented Negev tribal lan-
guages are fairly homogeneous. Some intertribal phonological, morphological,
and syntactic differences reveal possible independent origins. Thus, the pro-
cess of koinezation that they may have undergone would probably have had to
take place over quite a long period time to produce the present unity. Recent
lexicographical and semantic studies on the Negev Bedouin word stock attest
to intense contact with Old Kingdom Egyptian, implicitly supporting the the-
sis of the permanence of the local tribes in the southern Levant and Sinai since
ancestral times (Borg 2019a, b; Cerqueglini 2021).
In contrast to Bailey, Hall (2014) has recently supported the hypothesis that
the Bedouin of the Negev are ‘indigenous groups (Abu-Rabia 2002; Abu Saad
2008; Kedar 2004; Yiftachel 1997, 2003; for a polemic, Frantzman et al. 2012) of
agrarian, semi-nomadic Arab tribes whose presence in the Negev desert dates
back to the fifth century.’ As shown by the striking divergence of the differ-
ent hypotheses, since historical records are missing, not really much can be
stated with certainty regarding the Bedouins’ past in the Negev. From a lin-

guistic perspective, some lexical clues attest to contact with Greek-speaking
institutions, probably during the Byzantine era. I found one example during
the beginning of an interview with an elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informant, mediated by
a young speaker:
(I)3
Speaker 1: ēš isimki? al-isim … ēš isimki?
Speaker 2: niʿmih
Speaker 1: niʿmih umm ēš?
Speaker 2: an-nōma niʿmih aṣ-ṣāniʿ.
NʿṢ_F1920?_Lig/March 2013
Speaker 1: What’s you name? The name … what’s your name?
Speaker 2: Niʿmih
Speaker 1: Niʿmih mother of whom?
Speaker 2: The name is Niʿmih aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.
Becauseof theelderlymatriarch’shearingproblem,theyoungspeaker(Speaker
1) struggled to make Niʿmih (Speaker 2) understand his question, repeating it
a number of times and encouraging her to state her name accompanied by
the name of her first son, as is customary among the Arabs. Niʿmih gave her
name in a non-Arab format, mentioning her first name and tribal affiliation.
Interestingly, she uses the word nōma, not ism. Both words mean ‘name,’ but
ism is an Arab word, while nōma, a non-Semitic lexeme, seems to have been
borrowed from the Greek ónoma. Mentioning proper names combined with
tribal affiliations could have been a new practice introduced among the Arabs
and institutionalized during the Byzantine period at the latest in observance of
census recording. The young speaker was surprised by hearing the old woman
pronouncing the non-Arabic word and understood its meaning only through
his knowledge of European languages.
In modern Israel, the Negev Bedouin are often perceived as a group of
loyal citizens of the State, like the Druze, and unlike other local Arabs. Young
Bedouin often voluntary enlist in the Israeli army and due to their spatial skills
in orientation and tracking, their service is very valuable. The perception of
Bedouins’ loyalty and obedience is by no means tainted by the strong famil-
iar ties that bind the Negev tribes to relatives who migrated to the West Bank,
Gaza, Sinai, and Jordan and are kept alive by frequent visits, meetings, mar-
riages, and exchanges (Parizot 2001). I have often been involved in outings
across the border, to Sinai, where we also took the opportunity to go diving
in the Red Sea, and to Jordan, for weddings and other social occasions. Dur-
ing one of these outings, I was able to collect some of the most interesting

Ligīyih, west of the Jordan, and close to Karak, east of it.
Figure 3 shows a map from de Jong (2011), showing the presence of some
tribes, such as the Tiyāha, Tarābīn, ʿAzāzmih, and Aḥaywyāt on both sides of

was sketched following Bailey (1991; 2009).

Negev Arabic: Tribes and Linguistic Varieties
The Bedouin dialects spoken in the Negev are part of a linguistic continuum
that streches between Sinai and Jordan, grouped by Palva (1991; 2008) as the
Ḥijāzi fraction of the Northwest Arabian group. The main tribal varieties of
Negev Arabic (Blanc 1970; Piamenta 1996; Rosenhouse 1984) are represented
today by the varieties spoken by three major confederations, Tiyāha (Shawār-

bah 2007; 2008), ʿAzāzmih, and Tarābīn; two minor tribal groups, the Ḏ̣ ullām
and the Gdērāt (Henkin 2010; Shawārbah 2012); and the Maʿānīyīn, a confed-
eration of tribes that probably originates from the area of Maʿān, in Jordan, a
large region contiguous to the border between Israel and Jordan. Some of the
Maʿānīyīn sectors were historically protected by the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.4
As mentioned above, in the pre-State days, the Negev Bedouin lived a semi-
nomadic way of life, or rather a short-distance nomadism, with some seasonal
agriculture. During the nineteenth century, the Bedouin tribes hosted several
families of peasants from Egypt and Gaza, the so-called Ḥumrān, who culti-
vated the Bedouin lands and lived under the protection of the hosting families.
Mixed marriages with the new incomers were not permitted by the Bedouin
honor code, as had been the case in the past with slaves. For many generations,
the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ have hosted on their lands the Abū-ʿĀbid family, who descend from
African slaves adopted as servants and travel companions during an ancestor’s
pilgrimage to Mecca.Today they live close to the home of my host family.While
the language of the freed and affiliated groups such as the Abū-ʿĀbid resembles
the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ dialect in every respect, the languages of the local Ḥumrān have
retained their original features and are considered ‘Bedouinized’ vernaculars
(Henkin 2010: 50).

The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
While some tribes are scattered over different towns, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ all reside in
Ligīyih, alongside other tribal elements of the Gdērāt, Tiyāha, and Maʿānīyīn.
Theaṣ-ṢāniʿalsohostontheirlandsfamiliessuchastheAbū-Ġōrīfamily,which
‘lostitslandstotheeastandgotintotroublewiththegovernment,’asDr.ʿAbdel-
raḥmān told me. I asked where the lands of Abū-Ġōrī actually were, and it
became apparent that they were southwest of Ligīyih. But ‘east’ is a general
term often used to mean ‘somewhere in the Bedouin land,’ as it holds a com-
plex conglomerate of meanings, full of ancestral echoes and a sense of identity,
and does not always indicate the geographic east. This is true for all cardinal or
astronomical directions, as we will see below.

of Širīʿih together with their patrons.

of the inhabited portion of the tribal land, the cemetery area is found, as if to
imply that this is the land of the dead, toward the sunset, external to the land of
the living and symbolically ‘foreign’ to them. In short, I was learning that even
among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, considered the most modern tribe, the Bedouin space is
much less chaotic than it seems. It is organized according to rules unknown to
outsiders.
When I visited him in 2013, Abū-Ġōrī allowed me to sit in the šigg,5 open
toward the east, to have a coffee, and to take pictures of the camels and the
herds, but firmly refused to speak with me, fearing I was a spy sent by the
state to control him. Dr. ʿAbdelraḥmān, who personally accompanied me on
that occasion, attempted to mediate the situation, but in the end he urged me
to understand Abū-Ġōrī. One of his sons was wanted by the police, so he was
extremelycautiousandsuspicious.However,Dr.ʿAbdelraḥmānwasundeniably
surprised by our host’s insistence, since the fact that he was accompanying me
should have been a sufficient guarantee that my intentions were good. As the
sun set and Abū-Ġōrī remained silent, lying on his side, with the knife and gun
attached to his belt in plain sight, frankly embarrassed to host a woman, the
same crowd of barefoot and curious children who had welcomed us took us
back to the car.
The name aṣ-Ṣāniʿ (collective aṣ-Ṣunnāʿ) indicates the profession of black-
smith in the dialect of the Rwala Bedouin (Musil 1928: 136). The Rwala of
southern Jordan refer to the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ as a foreign social group, with which it
is forbidden to intermarry, as they are not ʾaṣlīyīn, i.e., they have no recognized
genealogy and intermarry with non-Bedouin. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ whom I interviewed
do not remember or recognize any connection between their tribal name and
the profession of blacksmiths or of craftsmen in general. In any case, certainly
my host, Dr. ʿAbdelraḥmān, may he rest in peace, was one of the most indus-
trious people I have ever met, and so are many members of his family, who
are expert technicians, physicists, doctors, excellent teachers, and other pro-
fessionals.
As soon as he completed his medical studies and returned with his Italian
wife, Valeria, ʿAbdelraḥmān designed and built his house in Ligīyih with his
own hands. In the Negev of the nineteen seventies, it was unusually innovative
in terms of engineering and comfort and at the same time respected the ances-

not allowed to enter and where he receives and entertains his guests and serves them cof-
fee.

tral rules; the front door opens onto a living room for male guests, while the
women have a different access door that opens onto a separate lounge. These
spaces are separated by the kitchen.
It is also true, as the Rwala say, that the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ marry wives from outside,
butthisistrueforalltheBedouingroupsintheNegevwithwhomIhaveworked
and lived.6 In the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ ʿišīrih in which I was hosted, the paternal line of ḥāğğ
Salmān, there have been two European wives and one Turkish one in the last
fifty years. There was also an Arab woman from the sedentary Palestinian pop-
ulation of the Muṯallaṯarea in central Israel. Yet the two most controversial
marriages were those of two girls of the family who preferred men of other
Bedouin lineages to their paternal cousins, a real scandal. But times change,
and the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ have a great capacity for adaptation.
According to the fixed narrative schemes by means of which the different
tribes describe their origins, none of them has inhabited the Negev since time
immemorial. Each tribe claims ascendancies from some other land, near or far.
Thus, for example, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ lineage is claimed to derive from a common
ancestor who reached the Negev some two centuries ago from Iraq. Once he
reached the northern Negev, he married local women from the semi-nomadic
groups that inhabited the coastal plains near Gaza, such as the al-Farānğī, and
fromotherBedouingroupssuchastheal-ʿUgbīandal-Ḥğūğ.Throughthesefirst
marital connections, Salāmih, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Iraqi ancestor, established the basic
architecture of an intertribal marriage system that links aṣ-Ṣāniʿ to al-Farānğī,
al-ʿUgbī,al-Ḥğūğ,andseveralmorelineageswhilecategoricallyexcludingother
local groups until now. The marriage system interacts in a complicated way
with both tribal identities and land subdivision. Thus, among the groups men-
tioned, the al-Farānğī are not included in the Bedouin genealogies, and rep-
resent a sedentary, or Bedouinized element in the genealogical tree of the aṣ-
Ṣāniʿ. The Ḥğūğ lineage belongs to the Ḥkūk tribe, which is part of the Tiyāha
confederation. Members of the al-ʿUgbī group consider themselves part of the
Tiyāha confederation, but in some classifications al-ʿUgbī is reported as an
autonomous group (Shawārbah 2012: 8).The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ lineage is included within
the Gdērāt group, which is part of the Tiyāha confederation (Shawārbah 2012:
6 Especially among the southern ʿAzāzmih, it is not uncommon to marry women from the Gaza
Strip.ThishappensbecauseNegevBedouinshavefamilytieswiththepeopleintheGazaarea,
and according to Bedouin customs, marriage should occur between paternal cousins. In gen-
eral,the bintal-ʿamm ‘the daughterof the paternal uncle,’is takenas the first wife, with all due
customary honors, while the choice of additional wives is less compelling. So, in some cases
marrying a woman from Gaza, even a non-relation, as second or third wife, is considered a
humanitarian gesture to help the woman have a better life in Israel.

times, when some rare intermarriages have occurred with European women
and Palestinian peasant women. Interestingly, in Ligīyih, the recognized village
north of Beer-Sheva where I was hosted among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, only people from
Tiyāha lineages reside, with their protégés of other origins. Nonetheless,Tiyāha
people also live in other locations.
Whether or not the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ descend from ancient blacksmiths, their author-
ity in the Bedouin landscape of the Negev, both before and after the creation
of the State of Israel, is unquestionable, as we shall see. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ claim to
be part of the Gdērāt, an autonomous tribal group. In fact, the political iden-
tity of the Gdērāt is quite fluid, as outsiders claim that it is part of the Tiyāha
confederation (Shawārbah 2012: 7), while the Gdērāt themselves maintain it is
autonomous. Indeed, the intertribal ties within the Gdērāt confederation are
quite heterogeneous. For example, according to my personal observations, the
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ intermarry with some Tiyāha lineages, such as the al-ʿUgbī and the
al-Grēnī, but not with others. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ dialect, certainly distinctive, is rec-
ognized by all neighboring Bedouins for its prominent imāla.7
The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ linguistic community consists of a large group of relatives that
could be described in sociological terms as a lineage, a unilineal descent group
that derives its common descent from a known apical ancestor. The common
ancestor is called Salāmih, and according to the tribal memories, he came
from Iraq. Apparently, he had to escape due to an expected act of vengeance
(Sacchi 2003: 36). Once, I was speaking with one of my informants, ʿAbdelka-
rīm, brother of ʿAbdelraḥmān, and asked him about the history of the tribe.
ʿAbdelkarīm is considered the šēḫof the ʿaylit ḥāğğ Salmān, being the older
son of Salmān, son of šēḫʿAbdelkarīm. His role no longer has any political or
other value, but he is still considered the most authoritative depositary of the
story of the family and the tribe. He has good linguistic intuition and is able to
recognize linguistic differences within the Bedouin groups with a high degree
7 With the term imāla ‘incline,’ Arab grammarians defined the tendency of some Arabic vari-
eties to utter short final and long a in a raised form, at any degree toward the apical i. The
term remained in use among Western grammarians, who have produced historical and typo-
logical classifications of Arabic varieties on the basis of the presence, form, and phonetic or
morpho-phonological contexts of its occurrences. Imāla has a particular classificatory value
among Bedouin dialects, with peculiar implications for the Levant and the Negev (Levine
2007; Shawārbah 2011; Sībawayhi 1881).

of accuracy. Using an especially synthetic spatial metaphor at the beginning of
hisnarration,hesaidtomeṭirīqnabiʿīd,lit.‘ourroad(is)far,’whichIinterpreted
as ‘our story is a long one’ or ‘we come from far away.’ From him, I received the
story of Salāmih and his long trip from the East, which closely resembles that
of the patriarch Abraham.
Salāmih’s arrival can be dated to the nineteenth century on the basis of
counting back through the generations. Interestingly, on different occasions,
the same informant, who retains the memory of the trip from Iraq, told me
that the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ group has been rooted in the territory of the northern Negev
since the beginning of time (Sacchi 2003: 39). The two versions are in fact not
conflicting or contradictory at all, since the limits of time and memory of the
relevant deeds indeed coincide with the memory of the oldest living mem-
bers of the group, as I noticed on more than one occasion. No one speaks
about the wife or wives of the ancestor, whether there was one or more and
whether he took them from his land or from the local Negev population and
related Bedouin tribes, as happened later in the case of his descendants. Even
his social position as a new incomer is not completely clear to me. The story
of the possession of the land in fact begins only with his son and grandsons,
who are allegedly the ones who bought the lands close to Gaza, in Širīʿih, and
north of Beer-Sheva and started managing them. They also began to marry
wives from those groups with which intermarriage would become recurrent,
meaning that the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ males would continue taking wives from within, i.e.,
from the noble tribes of the Gdērāt confederation (Randolph 1963) and from
within the wider tribal confederation of the Tiyāha. This last tribal confedera-
tion seems to be referred to exclusively as a large war alliance, whose function
ended with the end of the great war against the Tarābīn, which ceased at the
end of the period of the Turkish empire. Within one generation, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
thus established themselves in the northern Negev within the Gdērāt confed-
eration.
When the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ speak about themselves in other languages, they talk of
‘a small tribe’ or ‘a large family.’ In their language, they define their own group
alternatively as gibīlih (especially referring to the noble section of the tribe,
i.e., the lineage) and ʿaylih (referring to the tribe in its entirety, comprising
slaves, workers, and clients as well). The structure of the Bedouin family has
thusenabledmetoundertakemyworkwithinageneticallyandculturallycom-
pact and coherent sample of informants. According to the results obtained
from the experiments, the adaptation to the Negev territories occurred very
rapidly, as demonstrated by the deep, detailed knowledge of the local territo-
ries and as reflected in place-naming practices (Bailey 1984). Environmental
elements are salient as reference structures in the description of spatial arrays,

especially as frameworks used to locally anchor space descriptions. The son
of Salāmih, Sulaymān, with his sons Muḥammad, ʿAbdelkarīm, and Nabhān,
continued to reside in the north of present-day Israel and afterwards in the
south, where he bought lands. ʿAbdelkarīm and Nabhān, sons of Sulaymān,
had trouble with the Turkish authorities and disappeared into the Egyptian
desert.The current aṣ-Ṣāniʿ family, which inhabits the village of Ligīyih, derives
entirely from Muḥammad, son of Sulaymān, who had six sons: ʿAbdelkarīm,
Ibrāhīm, Sulaymān, Sulṭān, Manṣūr, and Amīr. ʿAbdelkarīm was the father of
Salmān. Salmān married his cousin Rgīyih and was the father of ʿAbdelkarīm,
the narrator of this genealogy, and Dr. ʿAbdelraḥmān, my host, among other
children.
When Muḥammad died, his son ʿAbdelkarīm became šēḫof the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.
He undertook war enterprises in favor of the Turkish Empire, including the
weapons trade. He was captured by the British army and imprisoned. After his
death in 1928, his brother Ibrāhīm became the šēḫ. As a child, Ibrāhīm was sent
to the kuttāb8 of Beer-Sheva, the school where the Bedouin boys received their
first schooling and became literate, basically through study of the Koran. After-
wards, in ordertoobtainthe propereducationnecessaryformanagingexternal
relations with the foreign authorities, Ibrāhīm studied law at the University
of Istanbul. Ibrāhīm ruled over the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ from 1927 until his death in 1952,
during the difficult period of transition from the British Mandate to Israel’s
independence(ʿĀrif al-ʿĀrif 1974;Henkin2010).9Ibrāhīmdiedoutsidehislands,
in Tel ʿArād, in a transit camp where the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ lived for some twenty-five
years. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ returned to Ligīyih in the nineteen seventies. No šēḫwas
regularly chosen after Ibrāhīm. Someone is still in charge of speaking on behalf
of the community, but things have changed, my informants explained to me.
Answering his nephew Ibrāhīm, about thirty-five years old today,10 Maryam aṣ-
Ṣāniʿ, bint ḥāğğ Ibrāhīm,11 explained to him:

I thank Ibrāhīm for having served as my guide and connecting me with the family elders.
He accompanied me to Maryam’s home, and she received me thanks to his presence.
Ibrāhīm is now around thirty-five years old. He is the grandson of Niʿmih, daughter of
ʿAbdelkarīm, son of Muḥammad. Niʿmih married ʿAlī, one of the sons of šēḫḥāğğ Ibrāhīm,
father of Maryam. Ibrāhīm considers Maryam his aunt and she considers him her nephew.

entire name refers to the fact that Ibrāhīm performed the pilgrimage to Mecca, ḥağğ, one
of the duties of a Muslim.

The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Narration of the Arab–Israeli Conflict: ŠēḫḤāğğ
Ibrāhīm’s Daughters Speak
The Ottoman šūq of Biʾr as-Sabaʿ, or just as-Sabaʿ, as the Bedouin say, founded
at the beginning of the twentieth century and never inhabited by more than
seven thousand people, Muslims, Jews, Christians, Druze, Bedouin, and others,
suddenly becamethe Israelitownof Beer-Sheva onOctober21,1948,at9:45am.
On September 3, 1947, the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine
had proposed that Beer-Sheva be included within the Jewish state,13 but this
decision was later reviewed and changed in favor of the Arab state. In May, in
the framework of Operation Yoav, the Egyptian forces in the city were defeated
by the Israeli forces. All houses and commercial warehouses that the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
tribe possessed in what is now called ‘the Old City,’ near the Ottoman market,
had to be evacuated quickly and were lost forever. The Arabs who refused to
leave the city were taken by truck to Gaza.
12
The form ʿindu is sedentary Palestinian rather than Bedouin. The iii m.s. pronoun suf-
fixed to the preposition ʿind is -ih in Negev Arabic. According to Henkin (2010: 59–60),
in Maryam’s speech, Bedouin variants are interchanged with sedentary parallels in close
proximity because her father had a ḥumrān wife, i.e., a woman of western peasant origin
(F1 linguistic variety, according to the sociolinguistic typology proposed in Henkin 2010:
34ff.).

Rgīyih
The last direct testimony of the days of šēḫIbrāhīm was provided by Rgīyih,
whose recorded memories were made available to me by her daughter-in-law,
Valeria, the wife of Rgīyih’s son ʿAbdelraḥmān. Valeria warned me that Rgīyih’s

before I came to the Negev, so I could not meet her in person. In the recordings,
Rgīyih recalled the days of the British Mandate, when her father was the šēḫ
of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and owned houses in Beer-Sheva, where the Bedouins did not
reside continuously. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ allowed people to temporarily occupy their
houses when they had to go to Beer-Sheva for business or medical care and on
the days of tribal councils. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ women occupied the houses at times,
taking refreshing outings to Beer-Sheva for shopping. Then they stayed there
and cooked and baked for days:

and the policemen. The governor was ʿĀrif al-ʿĀrif, an intellectual and politi-
cian from Jaffa15 who often visited the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.16 After the British left and the
Bedouins learned that the Jews would come and take the land, in 1936 ḥāğğ
Amīn al-Ḥusaynī attempted to forbid the sale of Bedouin lands to Jews. šēḫ
Ibrāhīm organized a meeting in 1938, in Širīʿih, where all Arab notables, from
within and outside of the Negev (Jaffa, Nazareth, Jerusalem), could meet Amīn
al-Ḥusaynī17 and swear they would not sell land to Jews. Nonetheless, some
of them continued to sell their lands. Ḥāğğ Amīn was persecuted and had to
flee. ŠēḫIbrāhīm continued his resistance alone: Ibrāhīm al-Muftī from Gaza,
a Turkish effendi, sent rice, sugar and cloth, attempting to corrupt him. Šēḫ
Ibrāhīm rejected all offers. Rgīyih said she knew which tribe sold its land first,
because they always went barefoot, and suddenly had money to buy shoes.
When the Jews took Beer-Sheva, the mosque was closed and the Arabs were
expelled:

Rgīyih mentioned Jaffa as a representative home of the non-Bedouin Arabs of central
and northern Israel. In traditional Bedouin narrative, on the regional scale, ‘north’ is the
semantic equivalent of ‘west’ from a larger perspective. As shown elsewhere (Cerqueglini
and Henkin 2016), ‘north’ is a secondary direction, split from the more basic concept of
‘west,’ yet maintaining some of its meanings. Among the meanings of ‘west,’ one finds
the notions of ‘strange,’ ‘foreign,’ and ‘far away,’ often with negative connotations. ‘West’ is
the watery, non-Bedouin world of the sedentary people, recently an ideal goal represent-
ing opportunities and progress. Within the geography of Israel, whose dominant axis is
the north/south one, the north is the land of the non-Bedouin Arabs, i.e., of the foreign,
urban, Arab societies, based on sedentary farmers.
16
Al-ʿĀrif, born in Jerusalem in 1892, served as district officer in Beer-Sheva and Gaza,
then as military governor of the Ramallah governorate. From 1949 to 1955, he served as
mayor of East Jerusalem. In 1967, he was appointed director of the Rockefeller Museum
in Jerusalem. He wrote a history of the Negev tribes of Beer-Sheva (Tamārī and Turjman
2011; Wasserstein 1977).
17
The controversial Amīn al-Ḥusaynī (1897–1974), Palestinian Arab nationalist and Muslim
leader in Mandatory Palestine, was one of the agitators of the Arab uprisings of 1936 to
1939. At the end of the riots, in 1939, he fled to Baghdad to escape retaliation, then made
alliances with the Axis Powers against the Jews and the British (Arielli 2008; Kaufman
1985).

According to Rgīyih, al-ʿĀrif was responsible for the loss of the city. Banned
from Beer-Sheva, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ were also removed by force from Ligīyih. The aṣ-
Ṣāniʿ lived three years in Ligīyih, looking with concern at the footprints of tent
pegs of Jewish camps, slowly realizing that the Jews were not looking for water,
but rather planning how to manage the whole of the land. Rgīyih’s brother,
Ḫalīl, was shot with a friend for having joined the resistance.
Then the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ were also forcedly removed from Ligīyih. Seeking protec-
tion, they waited in vain for forty days for King ʿAbdullah i to open the Jorda-
nian border, then resigned themselves to heading to Tel ʿArād.18 ŠēḫIbrāhīm
died there, shortly after the relocation, amid the hardships of a miserable life
in which water was scarce and food was smuggled from Gaza. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
remained in Tel ʿArād for some twenty-five years.
With the end of military rule in 1966, the young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ people asked the
incumbent tribal spokesperson, šēḫḤassān, to be allowed to leave Tel ʿArād
and return home to Ligīyih, closer to Beer-Sheva and new economic circuits.
Rgīyih used to close her testimony with the mention of the documents from
the Turkish era that confirm the lands were once owned by the tribe and never
legally ceded.

Maryam often mentioned the houses that her father šēḫḥāğğ Ibrāhīm owned
in the Old City and reminisced about the times before 1948:

chapter 1
‘Maryam: (…) at the house in Beer-Sheva, we call it ‘the courtyard,’ huge,
huge, huge …
Ibrāhīm: where?
Maryam: in Beer-Sheva, where the main branch of the Bank Hapoalim
is, go like this from it. Inside it is still just like it was in the past, only
the courtyard they destroyed, they made a post for the tourists, they
did then whatever they wanted, they wanted to destroy the house,
and we put tents and remained by the house … now, if God wants,
they cannot destroy it … The house of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ … all the brothers
of ḥāğğ ʿAbdelkarīm, the house belongs to them. Just as the children
of Abū Mḥammad have a house, in Gaza. My father also had a house
in Gaza. Until now there is a house in Gaza registered on the name of
my father, ḥāğğ Ibrāhīm.’
MmṢ_F1948_Lig/May2013
Maryam also mentioned the week when the large house of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ in Beer-
Sheva hosted the last great tribal council of the Negev before the final loss
of the lands. She also told this well-known story to me, as she had to other
scholars who interviewed her. There were seventy notables from all the tribes
and the atmosphere was tense. The women served food, bread, and coffee in
large quantities. Her father decided to break the seal with which the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
signed land transactions, so that it was no longer possible to sell land to the
new state. But it was too late. In 1936, the Arabs of Palestine had decided
not to sell other lands to the new incomers, but land transactions contin-
ued.19
Since Maryam was born in 1948, in Širīʿih, on the westernmost lands of the
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, her story does not derive from her direct experience, but rather stems
fromanarrativetransmittedthroughthesharedmemoryof herfamily.Maryam
often quotes the words of Rgīyih, her older sister, accounting for impressions,
feelings, and details that Maryam could not have directly felt and witnessed, as
Rgīyih did.
Here is Maryam’s account of the flight from Širīʿih to Ligīyih, then to the bor-
der with Jordan:
19
The Arab revolt in Palestine took place between 1936 and 1939. It was a Palestinian Arab
nationalist uprising against the British Mandate administration, demanding the end of
Jewish immigration and land purchases aimed at establishing a Jewish state. The revolt
was influenced by the declaration of Amīn al-Ḥusaynī of May 16, 1936 as ‘Palestine Day’
and the call for a general strike (Kabahā 2014; Kelly 2017).

slaughtered them. People were fleeing in the wadis, and we had store-
rooms for grain, buildings of concrete and stone, where wheat and
hay are kept and everything. They burned them, they set fire against
us, they burnt all our food, they fought us with fire. One day one
encountered a shepherd and killed him, one was looking for rab-
bits and they killed him, one went alone to take water and they killed
him. People started to escape from Širīʿih and flee to here, along the
road. You (f.) couldn’t go through how many dead there were, you
couldn’t go through, they massacred, they slaughtered their herds.
The few people that you see today on the land, they are but a few
now in Israel, they were more, they slaughtered them. We gathered
here and then they gathered us. Then they drove us away, one day
they said to us: ‘It is forbidden for you to stay here. To Jordan!’ There
were no cars, there were four camels. People ate wheat and barley. We
had pits on the site in ruins, so the wheat was put in the pits. So peo-
ple pulled up the wheat, took the children, they did not take the big
curtains, like this one, that remains on the house, only the tent they
took up, they took up the tent, and whatever they could bundle up
inside it, and the tool they cut the bread on and the tool they knead
in, but everything was left behind. First they took us to the Shoqet
Junction, and we proceeded very slowly. They took up the wheat from
here and put it at the Shoqet Junction, on the ground, there on the
border. There was the border with Jordan. Where today there is the
check point, there was the border with Jordan. We remained at the
border with Jordan, people kept fleeing to the border. Some remained
refugees in Jordan, some escaped from Širīʿih to Jordan, some escaped
from here to Jordan, some escaped to Gaza. Most of the people in
Gaza are from Israel.’

The second part of the narration reports a new detail, a short stop in Tel al-
Malaḥ, before the last destination in Tel ʿArād, where Ibrāhīm died and the
living conditions were extremely difficult. In her conclusion, she speaks about
the decision to return to Ligīyih to build a town:

‘Maryam: From the border they took us to Malaḥ, they brought us cars
and put us in Tel al-Malaḥ, from Tel al-Malaḥthey took us to Tel

The young Ibrāhīm is actually Maryam’s aunt’s (Niʿmih’s) grandson. Maryam addresses
him using the vocative appellation yā ğiddī, ‘oh my grandfather!’ This praxis is charac-
teristic of Bedouin languages, as well as of many other traditional languages (including
many southern and some central Italian dialects). It consists of reversing kinship terms
(Henkin 2010). In fact, it is necessary to establish what the rules of this reversal are. In this
case, Maryam is not Ibrāhīm’s grandmother, but rather a second cousin, also called an
aunt in some societies. Yet, in the reversed terms, she declares herself his grandmother.
This probably happens because brothers and sisters of grandparents and their children
are considered, and sometimes called, grandparents. Even in the sedentary dialects of
the Levant, the practice of referring to young people by reverse vocative kinship terms
is widespread among the elders: ‘oh my grandfather,’ yā sīdī, for grandsons; ‘oh my grand-
mother,’ yā sittī, for granddaughters; ‘oh my maternal uncle,’ yā ḫālī, for nephews; ‘oh my
maternal aunt,’ yā ḫaltī, for nieces.

children … People were hungry, were hungry, were very hungry. You

they had nothing to eat … now, my father died, he died [fell down]
suddenly like this, so he died. Nobody could help and the people
were hungry, some had no mattress, nothing to wear, to sleep or sit
on … So, we remained in Tel ʿArād, maybe twenty-five years or more
… Now, maybe we already live in Ligīyih thirty-five years. We lived in
houses, but in Tel ʿArād we started living in zinc shacks, iron, shel-
ters. Now, the Jews did not want us to build shelters, only two people
built something from [cement] blocks … but you were forbidden to
build with blocks in Tel ʿArād. We planted in Tel ʿArād, we grew vines,
figs, apricots, we built a lot of water pits … until now they bring water,
even more than at the beginning. Now, they decided to put us in a vil-
lage. Most of the people, you see, we said to them: ‘we want a village,
take us back to the village.’ So we came back to build a village.’

External Eyes on the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Story
Specific moments and characters of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ story before and after 1948
are portrayed in the words of Mūsī and Kāmilah al-ʿAmūr, who were born in
Širīʿih in 1941 and are from the Maʿānīyīn confederation,21 politically affiliated
with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.22 The Maʿānīyīn, who probably arrived recently in the Negev
from northern Arabia, orbited around the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ tribal core, having permis-
sion to dwell in its lands and live under the tribe’s protection. The al-ʿAmūr,
then, shared with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ the common destiny of the loss of Širīʿih and
Ligīyih, the attempt to enter Jordan, the exile in Tel ʿArād, and the return to the
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ lands in the nineteen seventies.23 Kāmilah al-ʿAmūr recalled:
21
The main tribal groups included in the Maʿānīyīn confederation are Abū-ʿĀʾiš, al-ʿAmūr,
an-Nasāsrih, aš-Šarāwgih, az-Zabārgih, and al-Ḥawāmdih.
22
At the time of the events, the family lived in Širīʿih, under the protection of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.
Frightened by the army, they escaped to Ligīyih for the protection of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, but the
same day Ligīyih was also depopulated. Part of the al-ʿAmūr family lives in Ligīyih today,
close to the houses of the descendants of ḥāğğ Salmān, while part lives in Rahaṭ.
23
The language of the al-ʿAmūr reflects phonological features of Maʿānīyīn Arabic, which
diverges in a number of ways from the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ type. These dialectal differences are main-
tained in the transcriptions.

some Segev Shalom, some Rahaṭ. So, we were scattered … They moved us

Other external sources on the history of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿfamily are found in the tes-
timony of Salāmih Abū Badr, whose family was affiliated with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ širk,
the sharecropping system in use in the pre-Stare era, as reported by Henkin
(2010: 37–38).

Ten Years among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
In the initial steps of this research, my epistemic landscape was focused on the
classical typological field of enquiry of space semantics, i.e., the relationship
between language and cognition. Nonetheless, as recommended by Newman
and Ratliff (2001: 6), I maintained the most flexible attitude possible, allowing
the responses of my informants to guide me to their conceptualization of the
domain of space and its relevant and essential aspects. Doing so implied a par-
ticular stance with regard to the speakers, i.e., I related to them as collaborators
rather than passive and unreflecting executors of research tasks (Gil 2001: 102).
In so doing, I discovered a deep consistency between language, cognition, and
spiritual and material culture.
Inthemonthsprecedingthefieldworkandthroughoutthesessions,Itrained
myself in actively speaking aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, doing my best to eliminate ele-
ments of Standard Arabic and Western Arabic dialects. I chose to speak only
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic with my informants, since the use of any other dialect or Mod-
ern Standard Arabic or Hebrew could have primed the production of irrelevant
data. In typological research, the attempt to speak the investigated language is
very important, not only because the informants and all community members
appreciate it, but mainly because it promotes a sensitive and receptive attitude
toward the semantic nuances of the new language (Newman and Ratliff 2001:
3).
As I internalized the semantic categories of aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, my perspec-
tive changed dramatically during the months I spent in the field, as did my
methodology, which developed from a very generic, standardized, and imper-
sonalapproachintoalanguage-specificandcultural-basedoneconsistentwith

and pertinent to the cultural system of the community. This transformation
enabled me to account for the aspects of distinctiveness of aṣ-Ṣāniʿ spatial lan-
guage and discover, at the same time, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ ontological classification of
concrete entities with respect to the domain of space. Levinson and Wilkins
consider the standardization of stimuli across languages the best guarantee of
the validity of comparisons (2006). Similarly, Levinson and Meira (2003: 487)
call for implementing a standardized and structured method for the elicitation
of spatial relations in order to allow for the comparison of data across lan-
guages. They claim that using an ‘etic grid’ could be the answer. An etic grid is a
field tool that, independent of language, captures all the possible distinctions
that could be made. Levinson and Meira (2003) also acknowledge the fact that
a researcher may unintentionally choose tests that only make the distinctions
that are made in the language(s) with which they are familiar. For example, a
speaker of English may choose an etic grid that makes the distinction between
situations where one would use ‘in’ and situations where one would use ‘on,’
but not the distinction between something that is above and something that is
high above because English does not make this distinction in its use of preposi-
tions. Therefore, Levinson and Meira (2003) propose the construction of a grid
by a group of fieldworkers experienced in different languages.
Nevertheless, looking for the rules of application of a small set of semantic
categories variously applied by all languages and based on just three elements
(the so-called spatial frames of reference detected by Levinson on 2003), at the
beginning of my research, I could not imagine the degreeof linguistic complex-
ity I was about to detect or the ways in which my methodology would evolve.
Indeed, at the beginning of my work, I did not know that, even though we
can expect to find in every language one, two, or three frames of reference, the
rules of their application and their combinatory solutions across languages are
not predictable on any systematic basis, whether exclusively environmental
(Cohen 1971: 107), typological, implicational, historical, or genetic (Ginneken
1935; MacLaury 1997: 179). Precisely this aspect of the phenomenon of seman-
tic variation turned out to be the most relevant finding of my fieldwork among
the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, and revealed itself to be culture-based.The importance of cultural
factors emerged in a striking way in the comparison of cross-generational data.
One interesting sociolinguistic phenomenon is the progressive differentia-
tion of the spatial language of young people from the system in use among the
elderly of the community. From a methodological point of view, generational
differences should not be confused and merged only with different degrees of
literacy. It has been argued that literacy has many important cognitive effects,
and it is clear that writing systems with (mainly) left-to-right or right-to-left
writing order and mirror-image discrimination between letters such as ‘d’ and

chapter 1
‘b’ or ‘p’ and ‘q’ may induce a special sensitivity to left/right discrimination,
and thus to egocentric, relative coordinates. According to Levinson (2003: 194),
subjects from communities with no relative linguistic coding and little literacy
do indeed display some interesting tendencies toward mirror image confla-
tion (Levinson and Brown 1994; Danziger and Pederson 1998). One hypothesis,
then, is that literacy may correlate with more intensive use of relative coding,
especiallyincommunitiesinclosecontactwithspeakersof relative-codinglan-
guages.Tamil and Belhare speakers do indeed show differences correlated with
literacy; among these groups, most relative linguistic coders are literate. How-
ever, literacy has shown no substantial influence in Hai//om, Kilivila, Tzeltal,
Kgalagadi and Yucatec samples (Levinson 2003: 196). From my experience
among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, I deduced that literacy is not completely and exclusively
responsible for the massive generational change observable between the lan-
guage of space of the elderly in comparison to that of young people. This may
be true for the simple reason that ‘literacy’ should not be always identified with
‘acculturation,’ which entails more radical modification. Writing practices are
not the sole factors that may induce higher sensitivity to right/left distinction.
Other practices, such as driving cars, or using similar utensils with functional
orientation may do the same. Furthermore, the vector of linguistic develop-
ment does not always stretch from absolute coding to relative coding attitudes,
as I demonstrate with respect to the evolution of the language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ in
thelastseveraldecades.Thus,if thequestionisaskedonlyintermsof ahypoth-
esisregardingtheprimingeffectof literacyontheshiftfromabsolutetorelative

The Language Choice
As Mithun warns (2011: 34), one of the main criteria for orienting the selec-
tion of a specific community in which to carry out linguistic fieldwork should
be the pertinence of the object of the investigation to the language and the
community under consideration, especially the presence and evidence in a
given language of the specific characteristics we want to address. In the case of
space, all languages and communities around the world are basically eligible
for descriptive fieldwork, since, as we have seen, all languages encode the spa-
tial experience. Nevertheless, my selection of aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic was not arbitrary.
At the very beginning of my enquiry, I intended to compare semantic data from
different languages of long-distance travelers belonging to different linguistic
families, such as Bedouin Arabic, the language of the nomads of the Middle
Eastern and North African deserts, who have recently become sedentarized,

andSangih,Badjaw,andMakassarese,Indonesianlanguagesof communitiesof
long-distance sailors.26 I noted that these communities of long-distance trav-
elers share a wide use of the absolute frame of reference, i.e., the systematic
grammaticalization of the cardinal directions in everyday language, but this
semanticstructureisappliedaccordingtosuchdifferentstrategiesacrossthose
cultures that it is impossible to directly equate such different experiences of
space.Furthermore,theabsoluteframeof referenceisnotexclusivetonomadic
or semi-nomadic societies. It is also found across a large sample of sedentary
groups living in restricted traditional territories, such as the Jbāli Bedouin who
settled many centuries ago in the St. Catherine area of Sinai or the Tzeltal
speakers of Tenejapa. As Levinson warned, as far as we know, these semantic
structures are not predictable exclusively on the basis of environmental factors
(2003: 43). In fact, the presence of one or another frame of reference, in their
various realizations, indicates a complex and culturally codified relationship of
thelinguisticgroupswiththeirinhabitedterritory,thefeelingof continuityand
belonging that the land inspires, the systems used to reckon their position and
orient themselves, and the symbolic, religious, and historical meaning of the
space, in addition to many other possible factors. Nevertheless, the specificity
of Bedouin language is demonstrated in different cognitive domains. On the
basis of existing preliminary research on selected cultural aspects of Bedouin
Arabic, such as its categorization of the color continuum, Borg (1999) states
that it seems possible to suggest that the special ecology of desert habitats has
greatly influenced the cultural evolution of Arabic-speaking nomads and that
this acculturation process has, in turn, profoundly colored the semantic con-
tent and formal structure of their special dialects.With respect to the investiga-
tion of the domain of space, a stratified cognitive, cultural, and linguistic struc-

conservative, and homogeneous community with a distinct cultural and lin-
guistic identity, rooted in the territories of the northern Negev. Although they
are now residing permanently in the village of Ligīyih, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ still live
according to customary tribal rules and engage in the ancestral Middle East-
ern pastoral practice of sheep rearing, but they occupy only a small portion of
the old territories due to the current geopolitical situation. The investigation
of the language of space of the elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ in comparison to the language
of the young generations comprised an unprecedented opportunity to observe
and typologically describe two distinctively recognizable stages in the history
of the language of a community that has maintained itself as a homogeneous
social entity throughout the challenging events of the last century, until the
abruptly accelerating acculturation of the last two decades took place. The
abovementioned circumstances naturally render the linguistic data garnered
here an object of considerable potential interest, as cultural clues and seman-
tic components of different mental world maps, broadly contributing to the
understanding of the deep cultural and environmental reasons for and seman-
tic syntactic paths of linguistic variation.
The Arabic sprachraum, according to Borg’s apt definition (1999: 131),
presents itself as an impressive kaleidoscope of linguistic and cultural iden-
tities concomitant with its unique and richly varied environmental cline that
ranges across nomadic, semi-nomadic, urban, rural, ethnic and/or communal
societal types that have extensively conditioned the structure and cultural con-
tent of contemporary Arabic dialectology. Sometimes these societies represent
the continuation of ancient traditions,27 and are often not easily definable
or accessible to the external observer. In an attempt to articulate a profile of
the anthropology of the Middle East, whose striking specificity is per se the
object of methodological reflection, Fabietti defines the social paradigm of
‘cultures on the verge’ (Fabietti 2002) to account for this multiplicity of inter-
pretations and attributions beyond which every ethnic, social, religious, and
linguistic Middle Eastern group can easily be concealed within the continuity
of the Arabic-speaking world. The issue of language and identity in the Arab
world, in particular the attitude of the speakers toward their language, is a very
sensitive one (Anghelescu 1993). One of the most interesting aspects of my
fieldwork was my explanation of the reasons for my work and of its scope to
informants who asked why I chose to carry out my fieldwork with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
community rather than in any other place where Arabic is spoken. Since my

aim was to actively involve my informants so that they could become aware of
the specificities of their own language and tell me more about them—much
as they had done with anthropologists regarding specific aspects of their cul-
tural heritage—I said that I was interested in the language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ. The
elderly of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ community, especially the men, who at least had taken
lessons in the local traditional Koranic school and were literate in Arabic, ques-
tioned my claim regarding the difference between their language and other
Arabic varieties: ‘Our language is Arabic. There is no difference between here,
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, or Egypt. The only thing that changes is perhaps somehow
the accent and pronunciation. But this is not relevant at all.’ My insistence on
the most relevant lexical and grammatical differences found no support; for
my elderly informants, the possibility of mutual understanding represents the
guarantee of cultural and symbolic unity across the Arabic-speaking world. I
resorted to proving that word meanings are actually diverse even within the
Arabic-speaking world, despite the lexical unity. This second argument—a tra-
ditional issue in Arabic philology—seemed generally more reasonableand was
more easily accepted. Often, young people and foreign wives supported my
thesis. In particular, a foreign wife, who had come from Europe thirty years
ago, said to her aṣ-Ṣāniʿ husband, ‘How can you say that our language is the
same as in all other Arab countries? If I leave our village, I still have diffi-
culties in understanding words and usages among other families. Of course,
I can eventually understand, but we would not speak in the same way.’ At that
point, the existence of some variations was finally commonly recognized, but
only as formal discontinuities within substantial and unquestionable linguis-
tic continuity. Without establishing a good relationship with the members of
the community, both women and men, it would have been almost impossible
for me to speak confidentially with them about these issues and to take them to
such a level of metalinguistic and meta-cultural speculation, mainly because of
the sensitivity of the language and identity issue in the Arab world, especially
in the Middle East.

Culture and Language of Sedentary and Bedouin Communities in
the Arab World
Beyond the point of view of the speakers, the scientific contributions to the
study of Bedouin languages clearly point to their specificity within the Arabic-
speaking world. Dialectological studies on formal aspects of Bedouin Arabic
(Blanc1970;De Jong2000;Ingham1986,1994,1995;Palva1976,1984–1986,2004)
have demonstrated that the grammatical patterns of the Arab nomads vary

considerably from those of sedentary communities throughout the Arabic-
speaking world. Borg’s study (1999) showed that the Bedouin color system
encodes six chromatic categories, whereas urban vernaculars spoken in their
geographical vicinity—not unlike several European languages—partition the
color spectrum into eleven categories. In effect, Bedouin Arabic dialects rep-
resent the outcome of a unique cultural and evolutionary process inasmuch
as they have developed independently of Arabic dialects spoken by seden-
tary communities since the Pre-Islamic period. The investigations conducted
within the paradigm of lexicographic and etymological enquiries (Alʿatāmīn
2011)showthatthelanguagesof theBedouininIsraelaretheoutcomesof aspe-
cific cultural evolution inscribed within the historical pattern of the nomadic
existence, which did not undergo remarkable changes until the period of
sedentarization. These varieties contain a large amount of lexical material
unattested to in Arabic dictionaries outside individual ethnographic studies
(Musil 1928). From a cognitive perspective, Borg’s works on color categories
(2007, 2009) clearly indicate remarkable distinctions between the Arabic
dialects of the Bedouins and those of the sedentary communities in the Mid-
dleEast.Therefore,asAlʿatāmīn(2011/1:2)maintained,thedifferencesoutlined
within the framework of dialectological studies should take into considera-
tion the different cultural landscapes of sedentary and Bedouin communities
and the different patterns of cultural evolution concomitant with different
lifestyles and environmental conditions. Bedouin languages merit investiga-
tion as varieties of a virtually autonomous Semitic language (and its internal
ramifications) distinct from both sedentary Arabic and the classical language.
Oddly, despite the impressive cognitive and cultural variety exemplified by the
Semitic language family, it is regrettably true to say that owing to the under-
developed state of the art in Semitic lexicology and lexicography, research on
the semantics of this language group has been somewhat marginalized, with
the result that it is at a disadvantage in terms of the exploration of its cog-
nitive and semantic typology and its interface with syntax and grammatical-
ization processes. The close genetic links within the Semitic language family
have also encouraged a tendency to assume the existence of considerable cul-
tural homogeneity within it. A serious probe into the semantic categories of
these languages with the tools of modern linguistics and anthropology can
therefore be expected not only to highlight their individual distinctiveness
but also, from a more practical standpoint, to considerably enhance the util-
ity of available grammars, dictionaries, and textual materials. The specifically
Bedouin cultural, cognitive, and linguistic traits that have emerged from this
study should also be perceived as a continuation of ancient cultural strata
pertaining to the early history and prehistory of Semitic nomadism in the

Middle East. Within the Semitic context, only a small number of works that
address the topic of space exist. In the Afroasiatic milieu, some works have
been devoted to Berber languages (Bennabi 1987), and Hausa (Hill 1982). Sig-
nificantly, the original Bedouin milieu in Arabia lay close to the geographical
and linguistic center of the ancient Semitic-speaking world (cf. the notion of
‘area centrale’ in Matteo Bartoli’s work, 1945). Thus, given the ancient origin
and conservative character of Bedouin Arabic, this linguistic tradition would
seem to present a particularly promising research area for both the diachro-
nist and the specialist in linguistic typology. As Borg notes, research on Arabic
vernacular varieties has generally tended ‘to restrict its concern to a brand of
linguistics largely modeled on the theory and practice of dialect research in the
West’ (2007: 263). The marginalization of research on language and culture in
the areal study of Arabic dialectal varieties found across this extensive linguis-
tic landscape, which frequently retain residual substratal formal and cultural
influences, has led to the unfortunate consequence of blurring the existence
of subtle linguistic boundaries between dialects that otherwise share major
formal traits. Languages other than Arabic spoken within the Arabic world
included, for instance, Coptic in Egypt; Aramaic in the Levant; Berber in North
Africa, and once in Al-Andalus and Malta; the Modern South Arabian (msa)
linguistic cluster. Peripheral non-Bedouin dialects in South/South-East Ara-
bia, the Baḥārna,28 and a continuum of Modern Standard Arabic’s coastal and
highland creole languages in Yemen and Dhofar represent linguistic basins,
where very close varieties coexist. The implementation of cognitive anthro-
pological approaches combined with a methodology of comparative grammar
could potentially contribute to a global understanding of cognitive and evo-
lutionary aspects pertaining to a specific semantic domain, such as that of
space in Arabic and Semitic, from a wider perspective. In fact, the theoretical
implications of these comparative studies should be carefully monitored and
checked against fairly systematic assessments of idiosyncratic developments
in specific Arabic dialects or dialectal areas. Recent work in the field of Ara-
bic dialectology, particularly that undertaken within the research paradigm of
the German school (Behnstedt and Piamenta), has, in the last few decades,
yielded an extensive and highly elaborate corpus of formal data on different
varieties of colloquial Arabic (spoken, for instance, in Yemen, Upper Egypt,
Northern Syria, and southeastern Anatolia) that consists, inter alia, of valuable
lexicographical records of Arabic vernacular previously only partially known.

Also Baḥārni. It is an Arabic variety predominantly spoken by Shiites in the Gulf area

chapter 1
As Zeynab Ibrahim (2005: 51) has recently discussed in the framework of acqui-
sitional studies and issues in teaching Arabic as a second language, considering
Arabic as a unicum leads students to face such a high degree of polysemy
in Arabic words (a problem that severely affects ‘Arabic dictionaries’ as well
when the provenance of meaning is not reported) as to render the seman-
tic boundaries of their meanings unclear in any case. In fact, these meanings
belong to different cognitive and semantic networks distinguished within a
plethora of culturally homogeneous communities that share beliefs, religion,
ethnicity, provenance, and ancestral environmental adaptation, which consti-
tute the essence of this work. Authentic research on the semantic categories
of dialectal Arabic is also liable to test to the utmost the theoretical aims and
methods of conventional lexicography itself, with its focus on ‘self-contained’
word meanings, since the attainment of innovative scientific insights into the
cultural content of civilizations presupposes an integrated systemic treatment
of lexical, idiomatic, and metaphorical networks generated by the speech com-
munitiesunderstudy.Fewdictionariesof vernacularArabicknowntomestand
up to this kind of test. Perhaps a notable exception is the dictionary of the
Tunisian Arabic vernacular of Takruna (Marçais and Guiga 1925), which exem-
plifies in meticulous detail the cultural dimension that underlies lexical usage
in this vernacular as attested to in a specific textual corpus.

Invisible Boundaries: Cultural and Linguistic Conservatism in a
Bedouin Community
A very important factor that makes communities of the Middle East particu-
larly interesting for fieldwork investigation is their striking genetic, environ-
mental, and cultural continuity, which provide very favorable conditions for
the most recent coevolutionary trajectories of the typological studies reported
above (Evans and Levinson 2009; Levinson 2008, 2013; Levinson et al. 2011;
Levinson and Dediu 2013; Levinson and Gray 2012). In particular, such strong
continuity is guaranteed in Bedouin societies by strict endogamy, a custom
according to which Bedouin males preferably marry the daughter of the pater-
nal uncle (bint al-ʿamm). This practice endures in the present as the most com-
mon rule for matching couples (Sacchi 2003), as I can confirm after attending
many wedding parties during the summers of 2012 and 2013. Furthermore, old
customsandpracticessurviveintheselectionof partnersformatchingcouples.
A network of social constraints impedes the formation of couples of different
origins, separating first of all different tribal confederations (Tiyāha, Tarābīn,
ʿAzāzmih, Ḏ̣ ullām), and within them, the noble tribes—al-ʾaṣlīyīn or sumrān

(Henkin 2010)—from the non-noble ones (al-ḥumrān), originally protected by
the noble tribes, and these from the slaves, the clients, and other protected
tribes, regardless of their more or less fortunate current economic situation.
These invisible but still effective processes of preservation hand down to the
present the portrait of a very complex and multifaceted traditional society. As
they have shifted from a nomadic lifestyle to a sedentary one, social conser-
vatism and strict endogamy have led Bedouin communities to organize their
settlements according to the pattern of familial affiliation, for the practical
reason that related household heads possess contiguous lots of land. Indeed,
the village where I conducted my fieldwork is largely inhabited by members
of the same aṣ-Ṣāniʿ family, which consists of many nuclei called ʿišīrih, which
together possess the land inherited from their great-grandfather, with the addi-
tion of some families affiliated with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ as former servants, clients,
or protected people. As Marx (1984: 1) notes, from an economic perspective,
despite the urban and rural development that has resulted from economic
growth, the traditional economic pursuits within the old frameworks have per-
sisted. The same can be said with respect to the changes that took place in the
social structure and culture. As Eloul (2010: 157) observes in the case of the
Ḥğerāt tribe, in the last century, despite the fact that daily life and material
culture have been considerably altered, these changes have not engendered a
collapse of their tribal organization and kin ideology (Marx 1984).
UsingTönnies’s (1887) typology of social organization, we can thus identify a
strong tendency of the Bedouin Gemeinschaft (community) toward adaptation
to new and different conditions of the Gesellschaft (society), adaptation aim-
ingatpreservingtheexistenceof thecommunityitself.Elouldoesnottakeeven
major future changes for granted, foreseeing that the contradictions between
state organization and the kinship-oriented society would promote tribal sol-
idarity. This striking social conservatism, exemplified by Kressel (1996), makes
Bedouin communities an extraordinarily fertile ground for linguistic investi-
gations. According to the impressions collected during unmonitored conver-
sations with my oldest informants, it seems that the linguistic isolation of the
Bedouin communities of the Negev has been intensified in the twentieth cen-
tury by the state boundaries between Egypt, Israel, and Jordan, which prevent
them from the perpetuation of long-distance migrations along the traditional
trajectories. These tracks once connected Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Sinai, and
the coastal territories. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ followed in particular a seasonal migra-
tion route along the east/west axis between the lands they controlled on the
Mediterranean coast close to Gaza (the green pastures), today no longer acces-
sible, and the lands they possessed in the northern Negev (the dry pastures). I
found no references in their traditional stories to relatives or terrains in Sinai

or Saudi Arabia.They refer only to a part of the family still living in Jordan. Fur-
thermore, because of the problematic nature of its definition in social terms,
well understood by its members but not by outsiders, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ group (some-
times defined as ʿaylih, family, sometimes ʿišīrih, extended family) has long
been neglected even in works that address formal aspects of the Bedouin vari-
eties from the perspective of Arabic dialectology (de Jong 2000), since they
inhabit a marginal area of the Negev and are often considered by scholars part
of the Gdērāt group within theTiyāha confederation, which the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ define
as a ‘war confederation,’ harking back to the days of the war against theTarābīn
and the ʿAzāzmih. In fact, all my informants, like the whole family in the upper
part of the village, derive from a single ancestor, whose sons took women from
other tribes within the Gdērāt. The women of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ only marry within
the ʿaylih (Sacchi 2003: 127). To the best of my knowledge, from the end of
the nineteen nineties, this tradition has been broken in only five or six cases
in which husbands and wives came from outside the family, and this always
took place in the framework of a particular background situation, such as a
foreign mother or a conflicted relationship with the parents. Henkin, in her
2010 book on Negev Arabic, recognizes the current position of the tribe, set-
tled in its territories in the Northern Negev since the nineteen seventies. The
gathering of the tribe within a small portion of its traditional territories has
helped to maintain its distinctiveness from other Negev Bedouin groups, while
the surrounding Hebrew-speaking community has contributed to maintaining
thelinguisticspecificityof NegevArabic(Henkin2010).Toconclude,wecansay
that within the linguistic continuity of the Negev Bedouin outlined by Blanc
(1970), Piamenta (1996), and Henkin (2010), the separation of the different
tribes has preserved interesting aspects of internal linguistic variety. Starting
from the methodological premise of Blanc (1970), who declared that his work
was based essentially on Ḏ̣ ullām informants, and the seminal work of Henkin
(2010), the most recent studies on Negev Arabic take into account evidence of
internal dialectal variation; Shawārbah (2011) describes only the language of
the Tayāha, and Alʿatāmīn (2011) categorizes the Negev Arabic texts collected
in his anthology by tribe.

Linguistic Anthropology in the Middle East
The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ linguistic community consists of a large group of relatives that
can be described in sociological terms as a lineage, a unilineal descent group
that derives its common descent from a known apical ancestor. In our case, his
name was Salāmih, and according to the tribal memories, he came from Iraq,

as mentioned above. My informants were selected only among the members of
the original lineage descending from one of the grandsons of Salāmih, Muḥam-
mad, preferably from both maternal and paternal side.The son of Muḥammad,
Ibrāhīm, ruled over the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ from 1927 until his death in 1952, during the dif-
ficult period of transition from the English Mandate to Israeli independence
(al-ʿĀrif 1974; Henkin 2010).
After Ibrāhīm’s death, for some twenty-five years, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ were forced
by the authorities to live outside their territories, in a fixed encampment in
Tel ʿArād, where some of my informants were born, still in tents. As men-
tioned above, they only returned to their lands in Ligīyih in the nineteen sev-
enties, where they first lived in sheds and later built houses (Henkin 2010:
59, 296–297). No šēḫwas regularly chosen after Ibrāhīm: someone is still in
charge of speaking on behalf of the community, but things have changed, my
informants reported. When I asked my informants to compare the old way
of life to the modern one, and especially to compare the tent and the house,
some of them feel nostalgic, others say that today’s life is much easier. The
women in particular reported that the tent required a great deal of mainte-
nance and continuous upkeep, because whenever a section was torn, it had
to be replaced immediately with a new piece of goat skin. Men generally do
not speak about the houses. I asked if it was cold inside the tent in winter
or at night. My informants said that it was warm and dry inside. Living in a
house,withinwalls,iscompletelydifferent,oldwomensaid.Theyfoundhouses
too humid for their bones. ‘Would you go back to the tents?’ I asked some
of them. They replied that they would not, that the life of the past is over.
In order to maintain the tent, an adequate number of animals and a com-
plex and delicate balance between man and nature, shepherds and herds are
required but these no longer exist. I remember old Niʿmih’s eyes turning away
from me as she recalled the black goatskin tents. From the warm roofing of the
tents, thick smoke used to rise over the encampment in the winter cold, she
said.

Endangered Languages in the Middle East
One of the most pressing factors promoting the study of minority languages is
the necessity of outlining their profiles before their disappearance. This is, in
fact, one of the purposes of this work. With the accelerating loss of linguistic
diversity in our world, it is a time for serious thought about how to record as
much as possible of the linguistic variety that reemains. As Mithun has noted,
‘In many cases what we choose to document may be the principal record of an

entire linguistic tradition, both for the descendants of the speakers and for oth-
ers seeking to understand the possibilities of the human mind’ (Mithun 2011:
35).
The cultural and linguistic variety of the Arabic-speaking world is currently
compromised by the processes of acculturation and globalization that charac-
terizecontemporarylifeworldwide.ThevernacularsspokenbysettledBedouin
in Israel are currently undergoing a process of koineization under the influ-
ence of urban Palestinian Arabic. Thus, the traditional dialects of the Bedouin
in Israel today represent endangered languages (Alʿatāmīn 2011/1: 198). Never-
theless, no atlas of the endangered languages of the world reports any case of
linguistic disappearance in the Middle East.
From the 1990s, when a large number of external marriages took place, the
old life and customs, the rural life, the subordination of women to men, and
the social subdivisions of the tribes have to a great extent been rejected by the
new generations, which strive for self-promotion through literacy and work or
relocation abroad for long periods. Some have started to buy or rent houses in
the cities. In the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ world, this march of progress is driven by the women,
who are seeking a new self-defined identity with respect to the role and posi-
tion of their mothers, while the young men are still close to the traditional way
of life exemplified by their fathers, and largely continue to choose their wives
from within the family and feel connected to the family land.
The culture-based methodology developed in the research described here
accounts for this deep cultural change, comparing the linguistic treatment of
the domain of space among the elderly and young people and revealing the
results of the profound changes that are clearly affecting the transformation of
the language of the elderly.
The ongoing linguistic transformation of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ dialect is evident in
direct comparison between the elderly and the young in interactions between
them.Iprimedsomeof theseinteractionstocontroltheirresultsquantitatively.
From a methodological point of view, indeed, one of the indirect tasks involved
in investigating the language of space exploits the strategy of allowing speak-
ers to interact among themselves about a given subject. Since I did not have
a laboratory where I could place two informants communicating on two dif-
ferent computer screens, as suggested by Levinson (2003), and since many of
my informants do not use computers, I primed the controlled linguistic inter-
action between my informants in a different way. At a family meeting, with
many men of different ages, I organized a game, explaining that it was a funny
game that I play with my colleagues when we are together. I divided the group
into two teams with two individuals in each. The pairs were seated back-to-
back, so that they could speak but not see each other. I gave every member

a shoebox with some toys inside. All the boxes contained the same kinds of
toys. One player of each pair received a ‘sorted’ box, where the toys had been
placedbymeinaparticularposition.Everymanwiththesortedboxhadtogive
instructions to his teammate so that the latter could arrange the toy objects
within his box as similarly as possible to the way the toys were arranged in the
sorted box. The winner was the pair whose array of objects in the second box,
constructed according to the first player’s instructions, was closest to the first
box.
This task yielded very interesting results, once it was subjected to cross-
generational analysis. During the first competitions, I only observed the way
in which the speakers gave instructions to the listeners, but suddenly I realized
that pairs whose members were closer in age had a greater chance of winning.
Pairs composed of young and old people together had very low chances of win-
ning the game, because the quality of their communication was impoverished
by difficulties in mutual comprehension, i.e., the use of cardinal directions, the
misunderstanding in the interpretation of right and left, front and back, mostly
due not to lexical differences, but rather to the different strategies of spatial ref-
erence adopted by the different age groups. Indeed, the change in language is
that extreme.
11
The Experience of Fieldwork
A problematic point that impedes and limits the exploration of the traditional
Middle Eastern communities and makes older speakers actually inaccessible
to Western scholars is the lack of a language of mediation, often in use among
anthropologists and linguists, such Spanish in South America; English in Aus-
tralia,Africa,andNorthAmerica;FrenchintheMaghreb;andRussianinSiberia
and Mongolia. The adoption of a language of communication is indeed a com-
mon practice during fieldwork (Newman and Ratliff 2001: 4).
I could not use any language of mediation, since the elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, women
and men, only speak their own Arabic dialect. Only a few men, members of
Group 2, whom I consider representative of the generation between the elderly
andtheyoungpeople,alsoknowsomeHebrew.Thesearemainlymenwhorep-
resent the community in its external relations.
To use the language of the studied community is not an unnecessary or
romantic caprice in any anthropological endeavor. In attempting to determine
the proper semantic values, speaking the language appropriately is extremely
useful. It is necessary mainly in testing the correct understanding of the mean-
ings of utterances used by the informants.

chapter 1
From a methodological and practical point of view, in addition to using
direct stimuli according to which my informants had simply to describe what
they saw, I employed the following methods to corroborate many of my tests:
1.
I attempted to describe, in the language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, spatial arrays that
I composed as my informants watched and waited for their approval or
correction.
2.
When I was investigating certain distinctive semantic features of partic-
ular interest, I asked my informants to place the toy objects in specific
positions, expecting a non-verbal response to the tasks. In such cases,
I had to use the local dialect in order to appropriately interact with
them.
3.
I asked my informants to give me spatial instructions in their language.
For example, I gave them a series of objects of the same type (stones,
balls,ortoyanimals).Theyhadtoplacethemindifferentpositionsand/or
in different locations. They were supposed to give me instructions of the
type: ‘Pick the stone that is located here,’ or ‘Pick up the ball that is in
front of object Y.’ In these cases, I had to understand the requests of my
informants in order to execute the instructions.
These three kinds of tests necessitate the active interaction of the researcher,
so knowledge of the language is required. These tests are very useful when a
researcher is attempting to enter the semantic system of the language and con-
firm the validity of data yielded from series of direct stimuli, derived from the
tradition of the Max Planck methodology. In particular, I used personalized
sets of stimuli based on Levinson et al. (1992) as direct stimuli to test semantic
strategies of representation of static angular relations.

A Woman among the Bedouin
Another important aspect of my work has been my gender identity. As a
woman, I expected my questions to be rejected by men, especially in the social
sector of the elders of the community. I was prepared from the very beginning
toworkonlywithwomen,asAbu-Lughod(1986a,b),Bettini(2006),andMarom
(2012) did during their fieldwork.
In fact, I was surprised to discover that, in addition to the old women that
I interviewed, several elderly men also devoted many hours of their time to
explaining issues to me in detail, with a great deal of patience. I wore a veil only
the first times when meeting men; afterwards, especially in the presence of my
host family, I preferred just to be myself, finding this attitude more appropriate.
I always dressed very decently and in black, knowing that this color can inspire

respect and a sense of honor in the informants’ traditional symbolic universe.
I did not want to play any further role or wear any mask.
I enjoyed the respect of women and men throughout my stay. None thought
of me in sexual terms, i.e., as a possible bride or girlfriend. Old women ques-
tioned me about my identity as an unmarried woman. Interestingly, the ques-
tionsdidnotconcernmysexualandreproductivelife,butmysocialstatus.How
could I live alone? How do my parents allow me to travel alone in the world?
Did they know that I was so far from home?
When I answered that I traveled for academic purposes, since I was taking
an important step in my professional path, they seemed to understand and
emotionally participate in the relevance of this activity and its challenges for a
woman. Some of them have daughters who studied at the university and have
professional lives. They recognized in my activity an instrument for the social
promotionandeconomicimprovementthattheirdaughters,of whoseachieve-
ments they are very proud, so persistently strove for.
Only Sarah, in her mid-fifties, a widow for many years, asked me about my
age and marital status, wondering how I could be alone at such an advanced
age (29), not being ugly. She guessed that my country was large, so it should
be easy to find a man. She warned me about growing old and remaining
alone and prayed for the quick accomplishment of my destiny as wife and
mother.

A Linguist, Not an Anthropologist
Meetings with informants for the purposes of the fieldwork usually took place
in informal situations. I went to the informants’ houses, and we sat inside the
house or in the courtyard. In some cases, the meetings took place in meeting
places in the village, such as the center for Bedouin embroidery, or on Ben-
Gurion University’s campus, in the case of the youngest group of informants. I
was usually accompanied by members of my host family, a woman if I went to
speak with women, and an old man when I went to speak with men, in which
case my host family asked me to wear the veil.
Sometimes I met the informants in the home of my host family when
they came to visit. Most of the time we sat on the floor, and I put the toy
objects or images in front of them. The informants were always very kind

and patient, even when I asked them to describe dozens of arrays. My inter-
views never took more than thirty minutes.
Generally speaking, communities and speakers can differ considerably in
their awareness of their language and attitudes toward it. For some, language
provides a strong, conscious symbol of identity, a cultural resource to be cul-
tivated and enjoyed, while for others, it is simply a utilitarian tool, given little
attention. In the case of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, all the informants were very confident
of their competence in the language, considering themselves all original noble
Bedouin.
With respect to my attitude during the fieldwork, in acknowledging people’s
responses I thanked them often instead of praising them. Since my informants
did not seem to need to be reassured that there were no correct answers, or
that I myself did not know the answers, I chose to present myself as a learner,
interested in finding out from them the correct way of describing things. They
reacted positively and quietly with respect to the presence of a researcher ask-
ing about aspects of their culture, being conscious of the interest aroused by
it among academics around the world. It was not uncommon for me to have
to listen to stories from my informants of people who had come in the past for
their fieldwork in the village, from France, the United States, and Italy, as well
as from Israeli universities. My family often introduced me as a doctoral stu-
dent, ‘like X, Y, Z …,’ referring to all the people who had worked in the village in
the past.
Thus, often, by default, they started speaking about the activities of the
women, the partition of the tent, domestic work, all things studied in the past
by anthropologists. When I led the discussion towards linguistic issues, they
found my attitude and my interests curious and perhaps strange.The host fam-
ily member who accompanied me often had to step into the conversation,
saying that I would ask very simple questions, and that they should answer very
simply, in the most spontaneous way.
Indeed, when I asked, ‘Please, now tell me only what you see’ while I set spa-
tial arrays consisting of toys in different relative positions, they wondered how
it could make sense to describe to me the positions of the toy objects in front
of their eyes.What kind of questions are these? Is it not evident that the man is
in front of the horse? Or north of the tree? Nevertheless, they acted with great
respect and answered my questions with ease, out of respect for me and mainly
for the people accompanyingme, despitethe fact that a guided task of thetype:
‘Where is X in relation to Y?’ is a very direct and dry request and may have even
seemed childish and beneath their dignity.

Spatial Domains and Spatial Relations: Terminology and
Fundamentals
This chapter addresses the selection of spatial frames of reference in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
Arabic and introduces comparative data from other Bedouin varieties and
genetically unrelated languages. In particular, it focuses on the relative frame
of reference. In order to explain the analytical notion of frames of reference
used in this work, I provide here some preliminary information about the ter-
minology and fundamental concepts adopted in the typological description of
the semantic domain of space, relating in particular to the concepts of Figure,
Ground, and spatial relations.
1.1
Figure and Ground
Languages tend to conceptualize and describe the domain of space not in
abstract terms but rather as a complex system of spatial relations between
objects.1 In particular, these relations are described on the basis of their basic
components: the objects to be located and the objects in relation to which the
former are located. In this work, I label the entity to be located ‘Figure’ and
the entity in relation to which the Figure is located ‘Ground,’ following Talmy
(1978), Fillmore (1982), Herskovits (1986, 1988), and Levinson (2003), who bor-
rowed terms from the terminology first used by Gestaltpsychologie.
Talmyprovidesthefollowinglinguisticdefinitionof FigureandGround:‘The
Figure is the moving or conceptually moveable entity whose site, path or ori-
entation is conceived as a variable, the particular value of which is the salient
issue. The Ground is a reference object in relation to which the Figure’s site,
path or orientation receives characterization’ (Talmy 1983: 232).

1 Levinson and Wilkins (2006: 3) call the tendency displayed by most world languages to con-
ceptualize space in terms of relations ‘Leibnizian,’ as opposed to the ‘Newtonian’ conceptu-
alization of space in absolute terms, referring to the debate on the nature of space that took
place in an intense correspondence between the two philosophers.

from that of location is only intuitively understood and often remains unde-
fined, since it is difficult to discriminate between them clearly and unequivo-
cally. The parameters and levels of distinction between these two subdomains
are treated in various ways across different languages and cultures, with pro-
found implications for the semantic strategies of spatial description.2 In the
domain of static location, the locative spatial relations may be of two differ-
ent types: topological (or non-projective) relations and projective (or angular)
relations.
1.2.1
Topological or Non-projective Relations
Topological or non-projective relations3 are represented by utterances of the
type: ‘object X is at place Y,’ e.g., ‘Robert is on the dance floor’ and ‘Alan is on
the train.’ ‘Topology’ in the literature on spatial language has a wider meaning
than the mathematical notion. According to Levinson andWilkins (2006: 3–4),
theconceptuallysimplestspatialinformationistopologicalinformation.Topo-
logical information may nonetheless be subdivided into subcategories such
as ‘distance,’ ‘contact,’ and ‘containment.’ Thus, ‘topology’ refers to the sort of
domaincoveredbytheEnglishprepositions‘in,’‘at,’‘on,’‘near,’‘between,’andso
forth, i.e., to notions of ‘coincidence,’ ‘contact,’ ‘containment,’ ‘contiguity,’ and
‘proximity.’ This domain may be conceived of as essentially involving spatial
coincidence or its approximation (as in ‘near’), with subsequent subdivisions
of types of coincidence (such as ‘in’ vs. ‘on’). In utterances that contain topo-
logical notions, nothing as complex as a coordinate system is directly invoked.
1.2.2
A Note on the Status of Deixis
In Levinson (2003: 66), deixis is described as a subdomain of static topolog-
ical spatial relations, but I claim that deixis concerns properties of speech
2 Thus, for example, the trivial difference between the Italian prepositional system Giorgio vive
a Roma, ‘Giorgio lives in Rome,’ and Giorgio va a Roma, ‘Giorgio goes to Rome,’ compared to
English ‘George lives in London’ and ‘George goes to London’ seems to be deeply enshrined
in cultural semantics.
3 The notion of topological relations is borrowed from mathematics, starting with Piaget and
Inhelder (1948), who applied it for the first time to the development of spatial representa-
tions in children. According to them, the spatial relations first understood by a child are
topological: ‘proximity,’ ‘order,’ ‘closure,’ and ‘continuity’ (indeed, this theory is also known as:
the ‘topological primacy thesis’). Later, a child begins to understand Euclidean notions such
as ‘metric distance’ and ‘angle,’ so he can establish projective relations. In 1978, Weinzweig
claimed that the topological relations referred to by Piaget and Inhelder did not exactly fit
the corresponding mathematical definitions (see Meini 2009: 19). Nonetheless, the theory of
Piaget and Inhelder strongly influenced later studies on spatial concepts (see Becker 1997;
Klein and von Stutterheim 1991; Levinson and Wilkins 2006).

events and thus affects all subdomains of the spatial experience (see Figure 4).
Furthermore, even though deictic adverbs and demonstratives in Western lan-
guages (e.g., ‘this,’ ‘that,’ ‘here,’ ‘there’) typically fail to provide projective infor-
mation on the horizontal dimension, some languages, e.g., the Eskimo lan-
guages(Jacobson1984;Fortescue1988),havedemonstrativesthathavenotonly
deictic content but also built-in cardinal directions.
1.2.3
Projective or Angular Relations
Projective relations or angular relations4 are exemplified by such utterances
as: ‘object X is in a certain position in relation to Y,’ e.g., ‘Robert is to the left of
the car,’ ‘Joan is in front of the building,’ and ‘Alan lives in the apartment above
mine.’ Space may be structured on the basis of not only topological relations
but also of the criterion of ‘direction,’ a fundamental concept in the human
experience of space. Direction is not only present in physical motion but also
in the movement of sight and may be attributed to every line that connects two
points in space from a starting point. Spatial relations that are described using
the criterion of direction are called ‘projective,’ as are the linguistic expressions
that represent them (Meini 2009: 23). In the case of projective relations:
[…] as soon as object X and landmark Y are substantially separated in
space, it becomes important to think about X as in some specific direc-
tion from Y—some kind of angular specification becomes relevant, and a
coordinate system is necessary to provide that.
levinson and wilkins 2006: 2–3
1.3
Frames of Reference: Definition
Frames of reference are exactly those complex mental structures that provide
the linguistic and cognitive expression of the angular information in projec-
tive spatial relations, giving the elements of the spatial arrays a coordinate
system. In other words, frames of reference are strategies used to mentally
project coordinate systems onto spatial arrays. By means of them, we are able
to conceptualize and linguistically describe spatial arrays that entail projec-
tive (or angular) spatial relations between an object to be located (figure, F)
and the object in relation to which F is located (Ground, G). Accepting this
4 Herskovits on his choice of the term ‘projective’: ‘English includes a number of prepositions
which are used to define directions about an object, and then specify the position of another
object in relation to these directions. I have called these prepositions ‘projective,’ because
all fundamentally involve the experience of viewing and the idea of a point of observation’
(Herskovits 1986: 156).

Conceptual Subdivision of the Domain of Space
Note: In Levinson (2003: 65), ‘here’ and ‘there’ are labeled as ‘radial categories,’
which are used to establish the position of an entity (Figure) in relation to
another (Ground, which can be the speaker or the addressee) when the Ground is
the center (0) of a radial space (a circular space, imaginarily set up on an infinite
number of concentric circles). In this case, the location of a Figure in relation to
the Ground can be described by the properties of a radius: length and direction,
so ‘there’ describes a longer radius than ‘here.’ Such an imaginary radial space is
variously partitioned across languages and cultures; some languages pinpoint
only two degrees of distance from the center (0 = Ground), based on the opposi-
tion ‘close ≠distant,’ while others can express further specifications (‘very close,’
‘within arm’s reach,’ ‘midway between speaker and addressee,’ etc.). In other lan-
guages, such as Eskimo languages, radial categories can express the distance and
direction of the Figure in relation to the Ground (e.g., ‘distant-eastwards,’ ‘close-
northwards,’ etc. See Jacobson 1984 and Fortescue 1988).

definition in the present work, I follow the methodology of Levinson (2003)
and his use of the spatial categories labeled ‘frames of reference.’ Meini (2009:
25) notes regarding the Levinsonian definition of frames of reference that the
label ‘frame of reference’ has been loaned from the lexicon of Gestaltpsycholo-
gie. It is so widespread in the literature on the language of space as to be too
seldom defined: we follow Levinson (2003: 24) who, quoting Rock (1990: 404),
definestheframeof referenceas‘aunitororganizationof unitsthatcollectively
serve to identify a coordinate system with respect to which certain properties
of objects, including the phenomenal self, are gauged.’

Summary of the Preliminary Definitions
Levinson and Wilkins provide the table reported in Figure 4, which summa-
rizes the above-mentioned linguistic and cognitive partition of the locative (or
static) spatial relations between two given objects into topological relations
and projective (or angular) relations.

1.5
The Use of Frames of Reference: Axes and Regions: Definitions
Projective relations between two objects can occur along:
–
the up–down axis (e.g., ‘the bird is above your head’),
–
the front–back axis (e.g., ‘Joan is in front of the truck’),
–
the lateral axis (e.g., ‘Joan is to the left of the tree’).
These axes are set up on fundamental asymmetries, which, according to Lyons
(1997), can be grounded in a primordial anthropocentric conceptualization of
space.5 In other words, in orienting themselves in space, both physically and
conceptually, human beings use their bodies’ inherent orientational proper-
ties, which yield pairs of opposite regions. These oppositions are grounded in
conceptual asymmetries, which may be roughly summarized as follows: the up
region is the opposite of the down region, the front region is the opposite of the
back region, and the right region is the opposite of the left region. These pairs
of opposite regions constitute three orientational axes.
In contrast to the use of the term ‘symmetry’ in everyday language, where we
are used to thinking about the right/left axis of the human body as constituted
by two symmetrical halves, in this study the human body is conceptually con-
sidered asymmetrical, since it yields the linguistic and cognitive opposition of
the ‘right’ and ‘left’ regions.6 To define the concept of region, I like to quote the
following passage from Svorou (1994):
The knowledge people have about frequently encountered salient enti-
ties may have several aspects. People have a very good idea about objects
they encounter in everyday life, their size, shape, texture and function.
Also, they know about their component parts, and especially about the
5 According to Lyons (1977), the vertical direction is the most physically and psychologically
salient, based on the upright position of humans and the asymmetry between the upper and
lower parts of the body, the experience of the effects of gravity, and the canonical position of
sky (above) and earth (below). The front/back axis is rooted in the asymmetry between the
anterior and posterior parts of the body (front region and back region), where the anterior
part represents the optimal direction for producing and receiving external messages. In par-
ticular, this direction is involved in bilateral interaction, where two subjects turn to face each
other (this position is called ‘canonical encounter’ by Clark 1973: 34–35).
6 As supported by its late recognition by children, in a gradient of salience, the lateral axis
(right/left axis) should occupy the lower position. The relatively scant salience of the lateral
axis should be due, according to Clark, to the substantial symmetry of the human body in
relation to it. Its acquisition seems to be related to cultural factors and daily practices such as
writing, reading, and driving (Meini 2009: 24). According to Lyons (1977: 691), the up/down
axis and the front/back axis are polarized: the upper and frontal semi-axes are positive, since
they describe the visible space of our interaction, while the lower and posterior semi-axes are
negative.

part with which they typically interact. Furthermore, they know about
the context within which people or other entities interact with particular
entities. I propose that all this knowledge may be incorporated into the
notion of ‘region’ of an entity. In the present view of language and spatial
relations, regions constitute a fundamental notion incorporating knowl-
edgeof thephysicalandfunctionalcharacterof theentities,whichinturn
determines the linguistic description of spatial relations.
svorou 1994: 12
Regions may be internal, external, or otherwise belong to parts of Ground
objects, in relation to which Figure objects are located; e.g., if I say in Italian
la casa è di fronte alla chiesa, ‘the house is in front of the church,’ fronte (lit.
‘forehead’) represents the region of the church in relation to which the house
is located.
Itisimportanttonotethatregionsmaybepartsof Groundobjects(generally
derivedfrombodyparts,like‘head’and‘chest,’orfromgeometricelements,like
‘corner’), but may also be extended beyond the physical boundaries of objects.
In the previous sentence, indeed, I do not mean that the house is attached to
the ‘front’ of the church but rather that it stands in its vicinity. Furthermore,
the meaning that fronte ‘forehead’ acquires in this specific context is given by
the coordinate system according to which the Speaker projects the concept of
‘anteriority’ontothebuildingof thechurch,i.e.,accordingtotheframeof refer-
ence selected by the Speaker when the church is the Ground object of a spatial
array.
1.5.1
Axial Restrictions in the Use of Frames of Reference
Thus, with respect to Levinson and Wilkins’s partition of the spatial relations
that we observed in Figure 4, we can add the following:
1.
Frames of reference, as presented by Levinson (2003), and, more gener-
ally, in the tradition of these studies, are applied only to the description
of the horizontal plane.
2.
The horizontal plane may be conceptually divided into the subdomains
of the front/back axis and the lateral axis.
Levinson himself (2003: 66) explicitly includes the up/down axis among the
domains described by frames of reference but provides no evidence of the
use of frames of reference in the description of this axis. Indeed, the verti-
cal dimension never seems to be partitioned according to such mental and
linguistic schemes, because it generally presents itself like an axis, i.e., as a one-
dimensional space (consisting only of the up/down direction):

Extended and Modified Version of the Conceptual Subdivision of Space Proposed by Levinson
and Wilkins (2006: 3)
This is the distinction formulated by Levinson (2003: 67) between ‘topology’ and ‘toponymy’:
‘In English, the prepositions (‘at Wimbledon,’ ‘in London,’ ‘on Salisbury Plain’) clearly assim-
ilate toponyms or placenames to the topology system, but in many languages placename
specifications require no spatial relators (one says in effect ‘he is Wimbledon’), or occur with
a special locative case, adposition or other distinct construction, hence we need analyti-
cally to distinguish toponymy from topology …’ In any case, toponymy is seen in this work
as belonging to the subdomain of topology. The issue of Bedouin place names is not addressed
here, even though the data provided by Bailey (1984: 42–57), Musil (1928), and others demon-
strates Bedouin placenames are rich in meaning and it could be hypothetically proposed that
Bedouin place-naming strategies represent productive mapping systems. This issue requires
further investigation (for general literature on toponymy, see Levinson 2003: 69).
[…] perceptual cues for the vertical may not always coincide, but they
overwhelmingly converge, giving us a good universal solution to one axis.
But the two horizontal coordinates are up for grabs: there simply is no
corresponding force like gravity on the horizontal. Consequently, there is
no simple solution to the description of horizontal spatial patterns, and
languages diverge widely in their solutions to this basic problem: how to
specify angles or directions on the horizontal.
levinson 2003: 35
One can thus modify Figure 4 as shown in Figure 5:
In other words, ‘the definition of directions along the front/back axis and on
the lateral axis can be provided only when an origin or a reference point are
given, while these are not essential for providing information on the up/down
axis’ (Meini 2009: 24).
Summing up, we can say that frames of reference are cognitive and linguistic
coordinate systems that provide (by means of various strategies) the angu-
lar information necessary to locate an object X (Figure) in relation to another
object Y (Ground) only on the horizontal plane, where the speakers have to
specify in which direction the Figure is located in relation to the Ground.

The Frames of Reference Terminology Adopted in This Book
When we observe a spatial array, whether still or in motion, and want to
describeittoalistener,threeaspectsof thedescriptionmayvaryacrosscultures
and languages: (i) What salient information we select,7 (ii) How we translate
this complex perception into linear speech, and (iii) The parts of speech by
means which we distribute the information we want to provide to the listener.
This section addresses the second aspect.
According to Levinson (2003: 35), essentially three main frames of refer-
ence emerge as solutions to the problem of description of horizontal spatial
directions. They are appropriately named ‘intrinsic,’ ‘relative,’ and ‘absolute.’ In
contrast to previous theories on linguistic space-framing, Levinson classifies
frames of reference on the basis of their functional characteristics and not on
the basis of the point of origin of the axes in utterances.8
2.1
The Geocentric Frame of Reference and Its Absolute Subtype
The application of the absolute strategy is the most intuitive among the sub-
strategies of the geocentric frame of reference. The use of the absolute frame
of reference can be illustrated with a sentence of the form ‘He is north of the
house’ to represent the following situation in Figure 6.
The semantic scheme of this spatial utterance is given by a ternary system
that includes a Figure, a Ground, and a coordinate system, called ‘allocentric’
since it is anchored onto external fixed bearings, which in the specific case of
Figure 6 are the cardinal directions. The absolute frame of reference is consid-
ered the most unusual one within the inventories of spatial strategies detected
by Levinson (2003: 3) in the European languages, in which it is generally not
used. As Levinson emphasizes,
7 Talmy (1983: 225) introduces the notion of ‘schematization,’ i.e., ‘a process that involves the
systematic selection of certain aspects of a referent scene to represent the whole, while disre-
garding the remaining aspects.’ Tyler and Evans (2003: 53) proposed the functionalist notion
of ‘vantage point,’ which ‘suggests that how a particular spatial scene is viewed will in large
part determine the functional nature of a particular spatial scene.’ In other words, spatial
relations between entities are not fixed once and for all, but rather largely depend on the
speaker’s perspective (Vandeloise 1991: 23).
8 ‘[…] [W]hether the origin is speaker (or addressee) or not, is simply irrelevant to this classifi-
cation …’ (Levinson 2003: 38). This approach takes distance from former descriptors such as
topological vs. projective spatial connectors, deictic vs. intrinsic usages of projective prepo-
sitions, and so on (See Bierwisch 1967, Herskovits 1986, Lyons 1977, Vandeloise 1991, and psy-
cholinguists such as Clark 1973 and Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976).

The Representation of the Absolute Frame of
Reference
from levinson (2003: 40)
This keeping track of fixed directions is, with appropriate socialization,
not a feat restricted to certain ethnicities, races, environments or culture
types, as shown by its widespread occurrence (in perhaps a third of all
human languages) from Mesoamerica, to New Guinea, to Australia, to
Nepal. No simple ecological determinism will explain the occurrence of
such systems, which can be found alternating with, for example, relative
systems, across neighboring ethnic groups in similar environments, and
which occur in environments of contrastive kinds (e.g., wide open deserts
and closed jungle terrain).
levinson 2003: 49
According to my direct experience in Indonesia, a variegated typology exists
in the application of the absolute frame of reference. Some languages, such as
Sangih, use only the cardinal directions, while others, like Balinese, use local
landmarks for the north/south axis and cardinal directions for the east/west
axis.9
The adjustment of relevant natural elements to the representation of
abstracted cardinaldirectionsisapparentlya widespreadstrategyamongabso-
lute framing languages. In fact, absolute directions present themselves as com-
plex cultural meanings that bear spatial information combined with social and
cultural knowledge. On this issue, Levinson notes the following:
9 The point is made vividly by many Austronesian island languages that fix an east/west abso-
lute axis by reference to the monsoons, but also use a mountain/sea axis. As one moves
around such islands, the axis anchored on cardinal directions remains constant, while the
one anchored onto the mountain/sea opposition rotates (Ozanne-Rivièrre 1987: 145; Wass-
mann and Dasen 1998: 693).

chapter 2
[…] places of particular sociocultural importance may come to be desig-
nated by a cardinal direction term, like a quasi-proper name. Secondly,
where the system is abstracted out of landscape features, the relevant
expressions (e.g., ‘uphill’ or ‘upstream’) may either refer to places indi-
cated by relevant local features (e.g., local hill, local stream) or to the
abstracted fixed bearings, where these do not coincide.
levinson 2003: 49
As mentioned, many languages make extensive or almost exclusive use of the
absolute frame of reference on the horizontal plane, fixing arbitrary bearings,
‘cardinal directions’ that correspond to varying extents to compass bearings.
While some languages have no way of expressing notions such as ‘in front
of/behind/totheleft/rightsideof Groundobject’asdeterminedbythelocation
of aViewer or Speaker, Bedouin vernaculars seem to share a characteristic con-
currence of frames of reference, possibly ranging across all three possibilities.
Among the Bedouin vernaculars spoken throughout the Middle East and North
Africa, the presence of the absolute frame of reference was detected by Nishio
in Jbāli (1996), where the upstream/downstream orientation of St. Catherine’s
wadi yields a local absolute frame of reference. With respect to the salience
of cardinal directions and their specific cultural and ecological values, Ingham
(2002: 299–303) reports several path-encoding motion verbs from Najdi Arabic
that provide different kinds of information, such as inclination of the terrain,
movements along land contours, location at a given time of day and, of partic-
ular interest here, the cardinal directions of the path and gradual changes of
direction. Such a system seems to be strictly related to the Najdi Arabs’ adap-
tation to the conditions of life in the desert.
In the most updated FoR typology, the ‘absolute FoR’ is one of the three
referentialsubstrategiesencompassedbythesocalled‘geocentricFoR’(Bohne-
meyer and O’Meara 2012: 220). The geocentric FoR is anchored on some envi-
ronmental entity or feature. The absolute subtype is angular-anchored, i.e., the
axes are derived by transportation or abstraction from axes or gradients of the
anchor. This is the case of utterances like ‘The tree is east of the house.’
Bohnemeyer and O’Meara’s geocentric FoR includes other two strategies:
1.
The geomorphic subtype, also angular-anchored, is used in descriptions
like ‘the ball is uphill/ downhill of the chair.’
2.
The landmark-basedsubtypeishead-anchored,i.e.,theaxespointtoward
the anchor, and is found in descriptions like ‘the ball is toward the door
from the chair.’
These substrategies are described in further detail and with graphic examples
in chapter 3, where they are encountered in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic and
related dialects.

Nonetheless, since in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic the absolute is by far the most
widespread substrategy of the geocentric frame of reference, the terms ‘abso-
lute’ and ‘geocentric’ are used in this book synonymously, with the exception
of some sporadic cases reported in chapter 4, where non-absolute geocentric
substrategies are described. Further specifications are provided there.
2.2
The Object-Centered or Intrinsic Frame of Reference
Following Bohnemeyer and O’Meara’s classification (2012), the term ‘intrinsic
frame’ is used today as a super-category that includes all object-centered strate-
gies and some interpretations of geocentric and egocentric strategies. Bohne-
meyer and O’Meara’s object-centered frame corresponds with the Levinsonian
intrinsic frame.These two terms, ‘object-centered’ and ‘intrinsic’ are used inter-
changeably in this book, when not specified otherwise.
The intrinsic frame of reference, as defined by Levinson, involves a coor-
dinate system centered on the Ground object. The coordinates of the spatial
arrayaredeterminedby‘inherentfeatures’orcertain‘properties’of theGround
objects referred to in the utterances. In order to become the center of the coor-
dinate system, the Ground object must have some ‘inherent’ functional or geo-
metric asymmetry. Examples of such Ground objects in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ include ‘the
door of the vase’ (bāb al-ğarrah), ‘the head of the hill’ (rās al-gōz), ‘the belly of
the mountain’ (biṭn al-biṭīn), ‘the tail of the tent’ (ḏīl al-bīt, the lower edge of
the posterior curtain of the tent), ‘the hind leg of the tent’ (riğl al-bīt, each pos-
terior pillar of the tent), ‘the face of the tent’ (wiğh al-bīt, the entrance of the
tent), and ‘the face of the knife’ (wiğh al-ḫūṣah, the blade).
The attribute ‘inherent,’ though widely used in the literature, is misleading;
indeed, such facets are conceptually assigned by different languages according
to some algorithm, learned on a case-by-case basis depending on the object,
or, more often, a combination of different elements10 They rely on culturally
variable conventions.11 Heine’s report (1989) that among the Chamus (Eastern
Nilotic), trees have an intrinsic front region according to their inclination or
their most prominent branch shows that the concept of inheritance is sensi-
tive to cultural variation.
10
The procedure varies fundamentally across languages. In English, for example, it is largely
functional, so that the front of a television set is the side we watch, while the front of a car
is the facet of it that lies in the direction of motion, etc. But in some languages, it is much
more closely based on shape, as in Tzeltal (See Brown and Levinson 1993: 46–70).
11
Vandeloise formulated the ‘principle of fixation,’ according to which ‘[a]n object may be
described relative to its usual position, even if its actual position differs from the usual
position at the moment of utterance’ (1991: 36).

The intrinsic frame of reference is classified as binary.The utterance ‘the ball
is in front of the chair’ presumes an intrinsic front region of the Ground (the
chair) and uses that facet todefine a searchdomain for the ball.The same holds
true for ‘the ball is in front of me/you.’ Here, the notion ‘in front of’ is a binary
spatialrelationwhoseargumentsareconstitutedbytheFigureandtheGround;
the projected angle is found by reference to an intrinsic or inherent facet of the
Ground object.
Intrinsic systems are generally plagued by the multiplicity of object types,
the differing degrees to which the asymmetries of objects allow the nam-
ing of facets, and the problem of ‘unfeatured’ objects (Levinson 2003: 48).
In particular, the multiplicity of object types easily overfills speakers’ memo-
ries.
2.3
The Egocentric or Relative Frame of Reference
The term ‘relative frame of reference’ in Bohnemeyer and O’Meara’s referential
typology (2012) is the subtype of the egocentric strategy according to which the
axes of the observer are projected onto the Ground, as in ‘the ball is left of the
chair,’ meaning that the left side of the chair is established by the observer. The
other egocentric substrategies reported by Bohnemeyer and O’Meara had been
defined previously by Danziger (2010) as ‘direct,’ and they are distinguished
as:
1.
intrinsic, angular-anchored, in which observer and Ground coincide, e.g.,
‘the ball is left of me’
2.
intrinsic, head-anchored, e.g., ‘the ball is on my side of the chair.’ This
last substrategy is treated in more detail in chapter 6, as it is widely
exploited in the language of the elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ. It is defined as ‘Speech
Act Participant-Landmark’ (sap-Landmark).
In the experiments discussed in this book, the intrinsic, angular-anchored,
egocentric strategy is not available, while both the relative strategy and the
intrinsic, head-centered, egocentric strategy are shown with their diverse dis-
tributions over the generations. For this and other reasons related to previous
terminological choices, I refer here to the egocentric strategies as the ‘relative
frame of reference,’ distinguishing, when necessary, the sap-Landmark frame
of reference.
Therelativeframeof referencepresumesaviewpoint(theOriginof thecoor-
dinate system), the Figure, and the Ground. It is generally used on Ground
objects that do not show any kind of intrinsic salient asymmetry so that some
salient asymmetry must be mapped onto the Ground object from an exter-
nal source (the source can be the Observer or a third reference object). Thus,
the elements of the array will be the Figure, the Ground, and an external

reference. For this reason, the relative frame of reference is said to be ternary12
and point-of-view-dependent (Levinson 2003: 89).
Mapping external coordinates onto the Ground object according to the rela-
tive frame of reference involves a geometric transformation which may be 180°
rotation, reflection across the frontal transverse plane, or translation (a linear
movement without rotation or reflection).13

indicates that Figure (F), i.e., John, is on the right side of the Observer’s visual
field, because the primary coordinates on the Observer (O) seem to have been
rotated in the mapping onto the Ground object (G) so that the left side of the
Ground object corresponds to the Observer’s right side. The tree is portrayed
as facing the Observer.
b. Reflection treats the front/back axis and the right/left axis, as shown in Fig-

AccordingtoFigure8,thesentence‘Johnisinfrontof thetree.’indicatesthat
the Figure ‘John’ is between the Observer and the Ground (the tree) because
the primary coordinates on O (Observer) seem to have been reflected in the
mapping onto the Ground object, so that the Ground object has a ‘front’ before
which John is located. Transferring the coordinates from the Observer to the
Ground object by reflection does not cause any change in the original position

Fillmore defines this frame as ‘deictic’ because of its relational nature (Fillmore 1982: 37).

right of the tree’ when in the same position as in Figure 7.
c. Translation treats the front/back axis in a way that is opposite to the way
reflection does, while the right/left axis is conceptualized as in reflection, as
we can see in Figure 9.
In Hausa (Hill 1982), the statement ‘John is in front of the tree entails’ indi-
cates that the Figure John is on the opposite side of the tree in relation to the
position of the Observer, because the primary coordinates on O (Observer)
have been translated in the mapping onto G (Ground) so that G has a front
on the opposite side of John’s position, while right/left terms remain con-
stant (similarly to what happens in reflection, Figure 8), as shown in Fig-

Hill notes that, under certain conditions of the array, speakers of Hausa prefer
to interpret the meaning ‘in front of’ as the English ‘behind’ (i.e., in the descrip-
tion of Figure/Ground relations occurring in the front/back axis).14 These con-
ditions of the array are:
1.
The Ground object has no intrinsic salient asymmetries on the horizontal
plane (the Ground object is a ball-like or tree-like entity).
2.
The coordinate axes are projected onto the symmetric Ground objects by
means of a ‘field of orientation,’ aligning the orientation of the Speaker
and the direction of the Figure–Ground array. This field of orientation is
called an ‘aligned field’ (Hill 1982: 16).
In other words, the aligned field and its application in the Hausa system are
related to the combination of a symmetric Ground and the alignment of the
spatial field of the Speaker (or Observer), to that of the Figure and Ground. Hill
also observed that in translation, the right/left axis remained constant.

Frames of Reference in Spatial Semantic Typology
Having defined the cognitive and linguistic nature of semantic strategies called
spatial frames of reference, I proceed to consider the relevance of their anal-
ysis in the typological classification of languages and finally to propose the
results of my own scientific experiments and their theoretical contribution to
the typological enquiry.
Since the experience of space is shared by all human groups, knowledge and
reasoning regarding space have been considered in the past to be based on
universal mental categories. Consequently, spatial languages were conceived
as mere projections of a single underlying innate set of spatial categories.
Even Benjamin Lee Whorf himself, founder of the school of linguistic rela-
tivism, seemed very cautious with respect to the issue of spatial language and
14
In the hierarchy of salience of the asymmetries based on the human body, the front/back
axis is considered by Hill less salient than the up/down axis and more salient than the
right/left axis. Hill considers this hierarchy an implicational scale. This order is reflected
in the number of entities in the physical world to which each axis is perceived as intrinsi-
cally belonging; we view more entities along the up/down axis than along the front/back
and right/left axes (Hill 1982: 14).

chapter 2
spatial thought: ‘Probably the apprehension of space is given in substantially
the same form by experience irrespective of language … but the concept of
space will vary somewhat with language’ (Whorf 1956: 158).
Nonetheless, the domain of space is not similarly partitioned across lan-
guages and cultures (Peterson et al. 1996). Languages use fundamentally dif-
ferent semantic parameters in their categorization of spatial relations differ-
ent coordinate systems, and different principles for constructing and applying
such coordinate systems, with notable effects on and consequences for the
cognitive level (Levinson 2003: 19–20). Let us observe two dialects of Bedouin
Arabic, Jbāli—described by Tetsuo Nishio (1992; 1996), and the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ ver-
nacular. On the same linguistic and cultural horizon, we find two diverse
grammars of space, where not only prepositions, verbs, names, adjectives, and
adverbs of space are different or used differently, but even the coordinate sys-
tems have developed differently. The Jbāli, who inhabit the area of the St.
Catherine wadi in Sinai, use a coordinate system based on the direction of
the wadi (Nishio 1996), while the elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ use the cardinal directions as
well as other strategies, according to specific priming conditions. These differ-
ences may be explained by the fact that, even though all human beings share
the basic and pervasive experience of space, human groups inhabit different
kinds of ecological spaces and adapt in various ways to the environmental
conditions with which they must cope. Thus, at the basis of the diversifica-
tion of spatial languages, one can imagine the results of ecological adapta-
tion on one hand and, of course, an intricate net of historical circumstances
on the other, or, as Keith Basso expressed it more poetically, using the words
of his Apache informants, we may reflect that ‘wisdom sits in places’ (Basso
1996).
Levinson too has paid attention to the impact of environment on language.
With regard to the use of cardinal directions for locating objects in space (i.e.,
the absolute frame of reference in his typology), Levinson states the follow-
ing:
Itperhapsneedsemphasizingthatthiskeepingtrackof fixeddirectionsis,
with appropriate socialization, not a feat restricted to certain ethnicities,
races, environments or culture types. No simple ecological determinism
will explain the occurrence of such systems, which can be found alternat-
ing with, for example, relative systems, across neighboring ethnic groups
in similar environments, and which occur in environments of contrastive
kinds (e.g., wide open deserts and closed jungle terrain).

On the same issue, Evans and Levinson affirm:
It seems inevitable that part of the explicans (of language diversity)
will be that language has coevolved with culture, which itself evolved to
give rapid adaptation to fast changing environment and migration across
niches. […] The dual role of biological and cultural-historical attractors
underlines the need for a coevolutionary model of human language.
evans and levinson 2009: 446
In this respect, the stratified complex of cognitive and linguistic resources of
the elder aṣ-Ṣāniʿ can be seen as the striking result of cultural effects of the
ecological adaptation to desert life.15 It reflects a dense history of exchanges,
contacts, and acculturation at the crossroads of three continents. This notion
seems to be supported by certain cognitive and semantic traits that are com-
mon to other languages, such as Aramaic, spoken by the Bedouin as the lin-
gua franca of the Middle East at least until the beginning of the Islamic era.16
According to Evans and Levinson, the coevolutionary models have to account
forlinguisticmutations,eventhosethatareobservableonthespotintheinven-
tory of modern languages. Unfortunately, due to the continuing disappearance
of languages, only a limited part of the world’s linguistic assets has been and
will be tested and unveiled. Due to the urgency of describing linguistic systems
that are disappearing primarily due to global cultural changes, and in response
to Evans and Levinson’s plea for a principled and exhaustive global mapping of
the world’s linguistic diversity (2009: 446), my research attempted to add new
material to the linguistic world sample of spatial systems, outlining the gram-
mar of space in the Bedouin Arabic dialect spoken by the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.17
In an early, embryonic version of the coevolutionary hypothesis, Levinson
and Wilkins state that ‘[…] hunters, sailors and taxi drivers are in a differ-
ent league from the ordinary city-dweller. This suggests that many aspects
of effective spatial thinking depend on cultural factors, which in turn sug-
gests limits to cognitive universals in this area’ (2006: 1). Thus, curious to test
the possible relationship between ecological adaptation and the semantics
15
‘Ecological adaptation’ is not intended here in the sense of ‘adaptive determinism,’ i.e., the
effects of the selective pressure exerted on organisms by environmental conditions. Here,
‘ecological adaptation’ is considered the construction of a peculiar Weltanschauung and
hierarchy of salience of realia based on the relationship with the environment.

Regarding cognitive patterns Bedouin languages share with Aramaic, note residual fea-
tures detected in Negev Bedouin, in Borg (2007: 263–294).

chapter 2
of space, I initiated a cross-cultural observation of the hypothetical coinci-
dence of semantic structures and cognitive categories with life activities and
related skills across different linguistic families. In particular, I had the occa-
sion to test the systems of traditional societies of long-distance travelers such
as the Austronesian sailors of the Pacific (the Sangih, Makassarese, Bedjaw,
and Balinese18 people) and the Bedouin Arabs. The outline that emerged from
this research, conducted over three years, revealed general converging aspects
(such as the use of cardinal directions as a linguistic coordinate system) along-
side a wide range of specific variations and semantic effects, as exemplified in
this work.
In fact, frames of reference are not only geometric coordinate systems sic et
simpliciter. Given that frames of reference are complex mental structures that
provide angular information in projective relations, we should add that they
always work in embodied situations: i.e., frames of reference are coordinate
systems and, at the same time, also include certain parameters of evaluation of
thepropertiesof theobjectsinvolvedinthespatialarrays.19Furthermore,these
properties are to a great extent culturally determined, as this work demon-
strates, on the basis of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ data. Indeed, examining the question of
frames of reference from a relativistic point of view, we should bear in mind
Talmy’s suggestion that ‘[i]f grammatical specifications generally correspond
to (linguistic) cognitive structuring, then the nature of that structure is largely
relativistic or topological rather than absolute or Euclidean’ (Talmy 1988: 171).
Levinson (2003: 3) states that ‘the choice of a predominant frame of reference
in language correlates with, and probably determines, many other aspects of
cognition, from memory, to inference, to navigation, to gesture and beyond,’
assuming that ‘human spatial cognition is culturally variable’ (Levinson 2003:
4).20
18
On the Balinese spatial system in language and cognition, see Wassman and Dasen (1998)
and Levinson (2003).
19
The recent tendency to focus on the relationship between the selected frame of reference
and the objects of a given spatial array finds an extreme expression in Brewer and Pears
(1993), who conclude that frames of reference are the ‘reference objects.’ In this work, I
retain the substantial distinction between frames of reference and the ‘reference objects’
of the spatial arrays. In my description of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ language of space, the properties
of the Ground objects are crucial not only in the selection of the appropriate preposi-
tions that describe their spatial relations (Cooper 1968; Leech 1969; Bennet 1975; Miller
and Johnson-Laird 1976; Jackendoff 1983; Herskowitz 1986; Vandeloise 1991) but also in the
concurrent selection of the appropriate frame of reference.

‘We cannot hold both to the thesis of the congruency of thought and language and to the
thesis of the universality of conceptual categories’ (Levinson 2003: 15).

Indeed, cultural differentiation occurs not only from a worldwide perspec-
tive. It is not difficult to observe differences across age groups within the
same society when radical changes in its members’ way of life of (e.g., process
of sedentarization) and profound acculturation processes (e.g., the transition
from an oral to a written culture due to systematic education and literacy) have
takenplace.Suchapictureclearlyemergeswithregardtotheelderlyandyoung
people in the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, as evidenced in the way that people from different age
groups react to differently designed stimuli used in elicitation tasks.21
With respect to the relationship between language and cognition, Levinson
(2003: 21) states:
Suppose that two languages A and B utilize as spatial coordinate sys-
tems fundamentally different semantic parameters (call them A’ and B’).
Now, suppose we can demonstrate on first principles that, in order to use
semantic parameters of the type in A, individuals would have to carry out
various mental calculations that users of B’ would not require (or not at
least by virtue of B’). Let us call this mental calculator α. Now we can
set out to try and find if speakers of A have α, while speakers of B do
not.
2003: 133
By means of this statement, Levinson summarizes his hypothesis on how lan-
guages work with respect to cognitive systems, seeming to ultimately support
a moderate version of Whorfian relativism, and fundamentally maintaining
that the nature of the relationship between language and cognition can be well
described by Dan Slobin’s ‘thinking-for-speaking’ theory (Slobin 1996).22
But if the question regarding the implications of linguistic and cognitive
structures in the minds of the speakers is asked in this way, the world’s lin-
guistic situation seems to comprise several monolithic entities, each of which
represents the coincidence in language and cognition of a given scheme. For
example, each culture should be distinguished by the presence of a certain
frame of reference in language and cognition.

within and beyond the Arabic sprachraum, compelling us to take a stand in
the dispute over the existence and value of linguistic universals.
In the history of the debate on universals (from the classic realism of Plato
and Aristotle through the nominalism of Ockham and Abelard to the ideal-
ism of Kant and Hegel), philosophers generally disagree on whether universal
properties exist in reality or merely in thought and speech. The doctrine of
universals has pervaded the linguistic debate on the relationship between cog-
nition and language of the last decades due to Chomsky’s claims regarding the
existence of universal grammar (Chomsky 1965). This theory can be seen as
an extreme derivation of the typological program (Comrie 1989; Whaley 1997;
Croft 2003). Indeed, the universal grammar theory, attempting to account for
the process of linguistic acquisition, postulates that the principles of grammar
are shared by all languages and innate in every human being. In the second half
of the twentieth century, typology had to face Chomsky’s theory (Evans and
Levinson2009:429).Beginningfromthisconfrontation,Levinson—amongthe
first to do so—addressed the cross-cultural examination of the fundamental
and common experience of space, turning the investigation of the semantics
of space (pioneered by Talmy in 1978) into the investigation of the relationship
between language and cognition within the cultural domain of space (Levin-
son 1996a, b; 2003). Later, investigation of the relationship between thinking
and speaking23 required research into the nature of the relationship between
language and cognition (Levinson 2003: 28). The question of the relationship
between thought and language is fundamentally rooted in the tradition of the
debate on the existence of universal cognitive properties and the undeniable
variations of their means of expression, a debate developed within the the-
ory of linguistic determinism. Slobin (1996: 70) began his preliminary explo-
ration of the history of the notions of linguistic relativity and linguistic deter-
minism by quoting W. von Humboldt’s Über die Verschiedenheit des men-
schlichenSprachbausundihrenEinflussauf diegeistigeEntwicklungdesMen-
schengeschlechts: ‘Language is the formative organ of thought […]. Thought
and language are one and inseparable from each other’ ([1836]1988: 54), there-
fore:
There resides in every language a characteristic world-view. As the indi-
vidual sound stands between man and the object, so the entire language
steps in between him and the nature that operates, both inwardly and

outwardly, upon him […]. Man lives primarily with objects [… but] he
actually does so exclusively as language presents them to him.
[1836]1988: 60
Subsequent proponents of the theory of linguistic relativity were Edward Sapir
and his student B.L. Whorf, according to whom ‘[u]sers of markedly different
grammarsarepointedbytheirgrammarstowarddifferenttypesof observation,
and hence are not equivalent as observers, but must arrive at somewhat differ-
ent views of the world’ ([1940] 1956: 221). They also state that ‘[e]very language
is a vast pattern-system, different from others, in which are culturally ordained
the forms and categories by which the personality not only communicates, but
also analyzes nature, notices or neglects types of relationships and phenom-
ena, channels his reasoning, and build the house of his consciousness’ ([1942]
1956: 252). In the framework of relativistic studies, the position of Franz Boas
(1911) exemplifies a ‘less deterministic approach’ (Slobin 1996: 71) based on the
concept of ‘obligatoriness of expression,’ according to which the set of oblig-
atory grammatical categories of a language ‘determines those aspects of each
experience that must be expressed’ (Boas 1938: 127). He was followed by Roman
Jakobson, according to whom ‘[t]he true difference between languages is not
whatmayormaynotbeexpressedbutinwhatmustormustnotbeconveyedby
the speakers’ (Jakobson 1959: 142). In the framework of this weak determinism,
Slobin postulated the existence of a special ‘kind of thinking, intimately tied
to language’ (Slobin 1996: 75), that marks the dynamic priming function of the
acquired language on this particular cognitive device (‘thinking for speaking’
theory).
The present work enters this debate with a new cultural approach, different
from the methodologies used to describe linguistic systems until now in the lit-
erature.Thisstimulatingnewperspectiveismadepossiblebecausetheaṣ-Ṣāniʿ
language of space amazingly presents itself with the complete set of framing

Ṣāniʿ cognitive system is consistent with such a linguistic situation.The answer
to this question will be discussed in a specific section at the end of the section
on their frames of reference.
In fact, languages use coordinate systems in a very puzzling way, establish-
ing such blurry boundaries between them as to compel us to reformulate their
definition and better understand which criteria govern their application. Fur-
thermore, speakers often change perspective and anchoring when speaking,
describing, telling, and referring according to the force, expressivity, and mean-

ing they want to give to their own words or according to the deictic information
they want to encode, and also according to a number of other variables, which
may eventually also be attributed to cultural constraints. One of the most dan-
gerous effects that the so-called ‘paradox of the observer’ can produce in schol-
ars from the contemporary globalized Western world is that it leads them to
underestimate the constraining force of cultural norms.
This study of the language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ aims to better account for the com-
plex process of translating cognitive and cultural meanings into language. I
begin from the observation that different frames of reference are used by my
informants according to various circumstances, as we will see in detail, and
thus I aim to determine the criteria according to which frames of reference are
selected.

Space and Time in Language and Cognition
Spatial cognition is a fundamental requirement for every mobile species with
a fixed territory or home base. It plays a central role in human thinking and
reasoning. The evidence for this centrality is all around us, in our language, in
which spatial metaphors are used for many other domains, in the obvious cog-
nitive utility of diagrams and tables, and in the special role of space in memory.
The idea that space is a fundamental intuition built into our nature goes back
at least to Kant (1768), and the notion that our perception of space is governed
by cognitive universals informs much current cognitive science. The impact of
spatial orientation on human thought and, in particular, on our understanding
of time, has often been noted.
George Lakoff assumes that our metaphorical understanding of time in
terms of space is biologically determined: ‘In our visual systems, we have detec-
tors for motion and detectors for objects/locations. We do not have detectors
for time (whatever that could mean). Thus, it makes good biological sense that

tics and conceptual structure. Where we have linguistic universals, the correla-
tion may be presumed to be driven by cognitive universals. But where we have
cultural divergences, language may not so much reflect underlying cognition
as actively drive it.
Hilda Kuper (1972: 411) states that everyone encounters the reality of space,
‘but how they cope with [it] is a cultural variable, evident in language classifi-
cation, technology, and ideology; and because members of different cultures
structure the same physical phenomena through different perspectives and
techniques, we cannot assume that they have a concept of space equivalent
to our own.’ Along with the universality of experiencing space, Kuper alludes
to an important connection between language and space, stating that there is
linguistic evidence of differences in the conception of space.
Whorf reiterates Sapir’s earlier claims by saying that it is in language’s ‘…
constant ways of arranging data and its most ordinary everyday analysis of
phenomena that we need to recognize the influence it has on other activities,
cultural and personal’ (1956: 135).To demonstrate this effect of language use on
the ‘cultural and personal,’ he compares English and Hopi conceptions of time
and space by analyzing the formal features that members of each culture use
to express them.
John A. Lucy (1997: 296) outlines three types of approaches that he claims
are equally capable of contributing to the study of this relationship: structure-
centered, domain-centered, and behavior-centered. The present study takes a
domain-centered approach, choosing a domain of the human experience—
space, and time assumed to derive from space—and then observing and ana-
lyzing how this domain is encoded linguistically, looking at specific semantic
instances in the language under study. Lucy’s methodology, adopted by Levin-
son (2003), among others, was formulated to compare the linguistic with the
non-linguistic (cognitive) treatment of the selected cultural domain (space,
color terms, kinship terms, body parts, folk taxonomies) and extend this com-
parison across the broadest possible sample of languages for the purpose of
typological classification.
The linguistic level of a typological investigation is hardly trivial. It requires
an analysis of the semantics of a language at a depth rarely available in gram-
mar books. The complexity of this enquiry consists mainly of the necessity
of devising special methods of data elicitation for spatial data, for example,
communicationtasksperformedbetweennativespeakersandpertinentsetsof
controlled stimuli. ‘Pertinence,’ i.e., the consistency of methodology and stim-
ulus design with both the scope of the enquiry and the social and cultural
context of the investigation is key in such research.
The selection of the domains of space and time as the object of the present
linguistic investigation is rooted in the tradition of typological studies. In fact,

chapter 2
space is a universal human experience and a core organizing structure of dif-
ferent areas of our mental activity, as several metaphorical usages derived from
spatial concepts and transferred into other domains, such as those of time and
emotions demonstrate (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Boroditsky 2001). Because of
the striking combination of the universal and essential character of the spa-
tial experience and its variability across languages and cognitive systems, in
the history of modern typological studies, space has constituted a fundamental
domain of investigation for the interaction of linguistic and cognitive struc-
tures, beginning with the pioneering enquiries of Fillmore (1975), Lakoff (1987),
Langacker (1987), and Talmy (1983, 1985).
On the basis of cross-linguistic data collection and data analysis, the nativist
theoretical tendency supports the existence of an innate, universal, and
restricted number of primitive spatial notions according to which all lan-
guages and cognitive systems organize spatial experience (Cardini 2010; Jan-
uaryandKako2007;Jackendoff 1983;Landau1994;LandauandJackendoff 1993;
Li and Gleitman 2002; Talmy 2000), while the neo-relativist and functionalist
approaches (Boroditski 2001; Bowerman and Choi 2003; Brugman 1983; Brug-
man and Lakoff 1988; Cuyckens 1991; Fitch 2010; Gennari et al. 2002; Gentner
and Goldwin-Meadow 2003; Herskovits 1986; Lakoff 1987; Levinson 2003; Van-
deloise 1991) claim a strict interdependency of spatial language and cultural
conventions and a strong priming effect of the native language on one’s system
of cognitive representations. According to supporters of nativism, linguistic
and cognitive variation occurs within a restricted inventory of possibilities,
while relativist approaches do not impose any preliminary limitation onto this
phenomenon, accepting even the idea of its hypothetical infinitude (Evans
and Levinson 2009: 431). In the last decades, with more data from different
languages added to cross-linguistic analysis, the domain of space has increas-
ingly been revealed as differently partitioned, conceptualized, and encoded
across languages (Levinson andWilkins 2006: 512). Data accessibility has led to
the implementation of a more elaborately documented and formulated neo-
relativistic manifesto (Evans and Levinson 2009), which in recent years has
enabled the investigation of the biological and historical dimensions of lan-
guages (Levinson 2008; Levinson and Dediu 2013; Levinson et al. 2011; Levinson
and Gray 2012;) with the aim of ultimately understanding their very nature,
the extent of their shared traits and their variations, and their relationship to
human civilizations.
Adding new data from a language that has never before been typologically
investigated, particularly with regard to the domain of space,24 sheds new light

on the mechanisms of linguistic variation and makes it possible to explore
the reasons for variation. Indeed, scholars have offered various explanations to
reconcile the apparently contradictory aspects of unity and diversity detected
across languages in every investigated domain. For example, starting from the
statements of Chomskian nativism (1965, 1966, 1968), Pinker claims that innate
universal faculties vary under the effect of natural adaptation (1994).
Inparticular,theexperienceof differentecosystemscouldberesponsiblefor
priming diverse ways of conceptualizing the domain of space across human
societies. This possibility is what I initially wanted to investigate by compar-
ing data from vernaculars of sedentarized Negev Bedouin and some languages
of Indonesian sailors. Indeed, I hypothesized the existence of some shared
features, due to the common practice of long-distance travels across deserts
or seas. Shared features indeed revealed themselves. These included the use
of the absolute frame of reference, but they are generally also found among
sedentary people living in very restricted areas. This preliminary hypothesis
thus proved to be wrong, and a new perspective on the complex relationship
between human groups and their territories was opened to cultural, linguistic,
and cognitive speculations.
As Levinson has pointed out, looking at a worldwide linguistic sample, no
evidence has been found so far of any systematic correspondence between
semantic structures and ecosystems tout court (2003: 46). Therefore, in his
most recent works, Levinson employs a multifactorial methodology for the
enquiryof linguisticunityandvariation,takingintoconsiderationgeneticaffil-
iation of languages to explain phenomena of typological convergence (Dunn
et al. 2005; Dunn et al. 2008; Levinson et al. 2011), ecological factors (Levin-
son 2008; Levinson and Gray 2012), and cultural development (Dediu et al.
2013; Levinson 2013).This methodology is known as the ‘coevolutionary model’
(Levinson et al. 2011).
Space is a particularly complex and multilayered domain for typological
investigation, where linguistic variation can occur on several levels. When we
observe and describe a spatial array, the spatial information can be differently
selected. Talmy proposes the notion of ‘schematization’ to summarize the pro-
cess applied by speakers selecting and reporting only those aspects of a scene
that they consider relevant (Talmy 1983: 225). Andrea Tyler and Vyvyan Evans
(2003: 53) support the idea that such selective variations are symptomatic
effects of what they call ‘vantage point,’ a function according to which the
carried out by Borg (1999, 2007, 2011, 2014), who combined typological methodology with
a diachronic perspective.

way languages represent spatial scenes is due to the way speakers see them, so
that different aspects or features of the spatial discourse can be given diverse
degrees of importance and salience, as happens to manner or path in the sub-
domain of motion (Talmy 1985) and distance, visibility, or size in the subdo-
main of location. For example, in the language of the younger generations of
the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ community, distance is simply treated as a subdomain (or sub-
category) of topological relations, consistently with a relatively small set of
descriptive strategies. But in the language of the elderly, distance does not only
represent a subdomain of topological relations, which in Levinson andWilkin’s
theory is opposed to the domain of angular or projective relations (Levinson
and Wilkins 2006). For them, distance is evidently one of the parameters that
co-occur in the selection of the appropriate strategy according to which the
projective information must be provided. In other words, the parameter of dis-
tance co-occurs in the selection of the appropriate frame of reference, and thus
co-occurs in the linguistic expression of angular relations.

Space in Cross-Cultural Perspective
Variation in the linguistic domain of space can occur with respect to the dis-
tribution of relevant information among the speech elements (Talmy 2000;
Levinson and Wilkins 2006). Furthermore, spatial subdomains, such as, for
example, motion and location, can be distinguished at different semantic and
formal levels. Thus, not all languages have two completely distinct sets of
prepositions to describe spatial relations in the subdomains of motion and
location.
Languages can also differ with respect to the semantic strategies according
to which complex and multidimensional spatial information is transformed
into sequential, linear speech. In our case, within the domain of space, the
present work addresses in particular the description of the horizontal plane,
which is two-dimensional since it is described—necessarily and sufficiently—
by the intersection of two axes that I distinguish and label as the front/back
axis and the right/left axis. In order to describe spatial arrays located in the
two-dimensional plane using a one-dimensional means, such as linear speech,
we must resort to some kind of coordinate system and use it as semantic frame-
work.
The organization of space grammars seems deeply rooted in complex cul-
tural strategies that certainly also involve the processes of ecological adapta-
tion and the historical paths followed by linguistic groups. Illuminating exam-
ples come from Iceland, where different meanings are attributed to the cardi-

nal directions by the inhabitants of different parts of the country, since they
anchor the cardinal coordinates to the different direction of the fjords, as Hau-
gen describes (1957), and the words ‘east’ and ‘west’ in the language of the
Aladyan, which correspond respectively to the meanings of ‘behind’ and ‘in
front of,’ since the Aladyan speakers reached their current position leaving
the east behind them and proceeding westward during their last migration
(Duponchel 1974: 259). With respect to the importance of ecological factors
in linguistic variation (linguistic determinism hypothesis), Levinson himself
(2003: 188) suggests the possibility of comparing groups from the same country
or region but with different linguistic characteristics regarding frames of refer-
ence. A representative case for this purpose is the cluster of Mayan languages
that includesTzeltal, Mopan, andYucatec.Tzeltal is predominantly absolute in
language, Mopan predominantly intrinsic, and Yucatec speakers use all three
frames of reference but with heavy reliance on the intrinsic frame of reference.
All three cultures have very similar material cultures and the same subsistence
base, although there are ecological differences between the Chiapas highlands,
the Maya Mountains where the Mopan live in Belize, and the less elevated
Yucatan. With respect to the question of compatibility of the historical per-
spective within the methodology of cognitive analysis, a suggestion raised by
Borg (2007) revealed itself as very suggestive in terms of the elaboration of the
methodology of the present research.Treating the issue of color categorization
across several Arabic-speaking urban, rural, and nomadic Middle Eastern com-
munities, Borg hints at the possibility of transferring the model implemented
by Robert E. MacLaury (1997) for his survey on Meso-American cultures to the
study of the plethora of different cultural expressions that characterize the
Arabic-speaking world, revealing the permanence of earlier traditions of the
Semitic area, stretching back to the pre-Islamic era. According to Borg (2007):
[…]MacLaury’smacro-arealsurveyyieldsthediachronicsof colorcatego-
rization a replicable research model combining the disciplines of genetic
anduniversalistlinguistics;itscomprehensivearealandtheoreticalambit
evokes the realm of ‘cultural ecology’ examining ‘the interaction of cul-
tural processes with the physical environment’ in ‘nuclear Mesoamer-
ica’ (Sanders 1962: 34). Its aims, scope, and methods would seem to be
eminently transferable to other civilizations, for instance, the Near East
(compare Sanders 1962: 37). Semantic and cognitive aspects pertaining to
color categorization across this other region, comprising a set of lineally
and obliquely related modern vernacular idioms of Semitic, opens [sic]
up a promising avenue for an extensive foray into the realm of linguistic
anthropology.

chapter 2
By raising the possibility of comparing the Meso-American and Middle
Eastern models for the reconstruction of the histories of the respective local
languages, Borg focuses our attention on the necessity of specific methods
of enquiry of different linguistic areas, which, working within the cognitive
framework, should not ignore the specific historical, ecological, and cultural
horizons. From a distinct point of view, given that different groups express
their cultural peculiarities in specific linguistic varieties, during the fieldwork
of the present research, age and gender groups provided interesting analyti-
cal perspectives within aṣ-Ṣāniʿ society, since they represent the most basic
nuclei of cultural change. Thus, alongside the main focus of the enquiry, i.e.,
the description of the use of spatial frames of reference, every fieldwork ses-
sion produced additional results, for example, the striking consistency in the
responses of women and men, despite gender-based studies claiming differ-
ent conceptualizations of space in men and women, and despite the rigid
separation of the genders that dominates traditional Bedouin life and the
lower degree of mobility of aṣ-Ṣāniʿ women.This observation seems to confirm
Levinson’s findings (2003: 194), according to which tests for gender differences
showed non-significant results in the samples of Arrernte, English, Belhare,
Hai//om, Japanese, Longgu, Kgalagadi, Kilivila, Tamil, Tzeltal, and Yucatec.
These results seem to contradict the many studies, going back at least to John
Langhorne (1948), that have somehowfound differential abilities betweenmen
and women in spatial orientation. The results shown by the community of the
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ raise interesting questions regarding the cross-cultural validity of the
gender bias in spatial reasoning, which has been taken for granted for so long
in the field, and produce further data to answer the question whether the gen-
der effect found in some communities in Europe and North America (Levinson
2003: 194) is cultural or culture-independent.

Does ‘Space’ Exist Everywhere?
Despite its universality and fundamental role in human interaction with prac-
tical and cultural experience, ‘space is not a restricted domain like color terms,
kinship or the plant world, in each of which it is arguably natural to ask how
languages code the relevant distinctions’ (Levinson 2003: 64). Even its exis-
tence as an identifiable concept across languages and cultures is questionable.
Indeed, probably few languages have a word for ‘space’ in the abstract sense
in which it is used in this work. In fact, centuries of sustained philosophical
and scientific speculation have led to the definition of the abstract notion of
space currently in use in Western thought. As Levinson points out (2003), ‘[i]n

unwritten languages one is more likely to find a term for ‘place where some-
thing belongs to’ (as in Tzeltal), or ‘sacred site’ (as in Guugu Yimithirr), i.e., the
notion of place is much more frequently lexicalized (often with restrictions, as
intheseexamples)thantheabstractnotionof space.’Apparently,NegevArabic
behaves consistently with this prediction. No abstract word for ‘the concept of
space’ seems to exist.25
At least in my case, I found many difficulties in adequately and properly
ascertaining the existence of the word ‘space’ during my fieldwork. Indeed, it
was not easy to investigate the existence of an abstract entity, in view of my
methodological attempt to renounce the use of any language other than the
language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and to resort as little as possible to the use of Modern
Standard Arabic lexical sources. I first listened to the spontaneous linguistic
input of daily life and then attempted to initiate free conversations, by means
of which I could indirectly lead the speakers to use the required concept, such
as questions about the internal division of the traditional tent and the possi-
ble inconveniences of living together with the many members of an extended
family with many wives (and constantly sharing the common space). Often
the speakers attempted to satisfy my purpose during the entire conversation,
saying that in a tent everyone had his own ‘place’ to sleep (minām), his sector
(rifrāf≈rufrāf ), and, in the case of the men, his place to sit and welcome guests
(šigg). Speaking with the elderly, I collected a plethora of specific terms indi-
cating several kinds of places: places to water camels, places to rest, places for
watchingthelandscape,cultivatedanduncultivatedplaces,placestomakewar,
places to trade, places for animals and places for people, for men and women.
This situation is mirrored in several collections of Bedouin poetry and oral
texts, especially the oldest ones (Musil 1928; De Landberg 1940; Boris 1958). I
was consistently unable to identify any generic term for space. Thus, since in
the traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ world, no space apparently lacked a proper name or
function, or, in other terms, every space was a determined, ‘embodied’ place, I
began to initiate daily guided conversations on modern objects such as houses
and cars, using indiscriminately the word makān, which in Modern Standard
Arabic means ‘place,’26 in all those cases where I would use ‘space’ in my native

Gideon Kressel, personal communication, Sde Boqer Campus, Summer 2012. A general
word for ‘space’ is not to be found in the dictionaries of Bedouin Arabic varieties (see
Alʿatāmīn 2011; Boris 1958; de Landberg 1920–1942; Kurpershoek 1995; Marom 2012; Sha-
wārbah 2012; Stewart 1990). Nishio (1992) expressively reports for Jbāli Arabic some words
meaning ‘place, spot,’ but no generic term to express the concept of ‘space’ in the section
of his thematic dictionary devoted to spatial terms.
26
Musil reports the use of makān as ‘place’ in Rwala (1928: 412).

language (Italian). I expected some kind of feedback and correction from my
interlocutors that would help me to determine whether ‘place’ and ‘space’ are
treated as separate concepts and understand the semantic boundary between
them.
The selection of different kinds of Ground objects, which I call culture-
related and culture-independent, is a key strategy in the investigation of aṣ-
ṢāniʿArabicandhasrevealeditself tobeveryfruitful.Thesamemethodological
principle has guided me in the selection of the stimuli throughout my field-
work, highlighting a gap between the language that describes the traditional
world and the language describes contemporary life. As an example of the new
linguistic attitude of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ community toward more general and abstract
terms as they face the challenge of this rapidly changing world, in the descrip-
tion of a journey in a crowded and overloaded car (where even the smallest
space was filled), my informants corrected my random use of makān, saying
that nobody else could find a place to sit (maṭraḥ) or any space for their lug-
gage (maṭraḥ) in such an overcrowded car. The same word, maṭraḥ, was used,
instead of my incorrect use of makān, in the case of a guided conversation
about a couple with many children who want to build a new house because
they need more space, maṭraḥ. Maṭraḥmeans also ‘the surface’ where the
house will be built and ‘the place’ where it will be built (when mentioning the
higher location of the new house, which is better than the former, lower place-
ment). In addition, a seven-year-old child, pointing at his stomach, said to his
grandmother: ğiddih! sawwēt lay maṭraḥl-al-malfūf! ‘Grandma! I made myself
space for the cabbage rolls,’ meaning that even though the child was sated, he
had left some empty space in his stomach so he could eat his favorite food. The
word maṭraḥoriginates from the same root as the verb ṭaraḥ‘étendre une cou-
verture’ (Boris 1958: 371). Boris translates the Marāzīg term meṭrāḥinto French
‘endroit’ (Boris 1958: 371), ‘place.’ In aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, the term maṭraḥ, used as
‘place’ and ‘space,’ can often be replaced by the term wasāʿah ‘vastness,’ mainly
when clearly referring to an open or an empty space.
Furthermore, all my elderly informants interestingly agreed on the fact that
makān is not in use with the common meaning of ‘place’ in their community,
with the only exception of the referential context in which someone speaks
about a place, apparently far away in time or space or unknown (makān flānī,
‘a certain place’). In order to be sure about the absence of a special word for the
abstract concept of ‘space,’ I openly addressed the question to literate people,
asking them about the existence of a term for ‘space’ by means of the Hebrew
word merḥav ‘space,’ whose meaning describes, for example, the subject of
my thesis in the academic context. Indeed, the only language of communica-
tion I could use with my informants, beside aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic itself, a Palestinian

dialect,andModernStandardArabic,wasHebrew,andonlywithliterateadults
and more generally with members of the youngest generations, who study
Hebrew at school. Thus, I asked literate informants in Hebrew, ‘How do you
say ‘space’ (merḥav)?’ The answer did not come easily, even for literate young
people—studentsof scientificfacultiesof aHebrew-speakinguniversity,famil-
iar with the concept of geometric and physical space, whose understanding
of the abstract Hebrew term for ‘space’ was certain. They began to wonder
how they could translate it into aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic. One said, ‘If you have empty
land, like … imagine this land without houses’ [pointing at the buildings of the
campus] … then you can say al-būrah, ‘the empty land’ [lit. ‘the uncultivated
land’].’27 I also asked aṣ-Ṣāniʿ university students in English about particular
expressions, such as the way to say ‘the space between us’ in their language.
Most of the informants answered using maṭraḥ, while some used the word
faraʿah ‘separation, distance,’ mentioning that this word was not in use within
theaṣ-Ṣāniʿcommunity.Oneadded,‘PerhapsitishighArabic…’Someoneused
thewordal-ğaww‘theair.’28Olderliteratespeakersattemptedtoprovidemethe
exact meaning I was seeking, using būrah, manṭagah ‘field’/‘area’29 or manṭa-
gah wisīʿih ‘large field,’30 as if increasing the value of emptiness and extent by
means of the adjective wisīʿih could match the most abstract meaning possible.
The concept of ‘emptiness’ in the Standard Arabic word fāḏ̣ī ‘empty’ is affili-
ated with the astronomical concept of space, used only by young and literate
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ. From these cross-generational observations, I realized that while the
old semantic system was predominantly constituted by determined ‘places,’ in
the contemporary language of the new generations, maṭraḥand wasāʿah are
generically used to define ‘place’ and some kind of functional ‘space.’ As the
language of the elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ reveals, space is defined by functional, rou-
tine, or referential places whose features are rooted in cultural schemata and
whose existence and linguistic productivity are giving way to the deep changes
in lifestyle, housing structures, and economic activities that have occurred in
the last several decades. Finally, while no specific term in contemporary aṣ-

This use of būrah parallels the Jbāli Arabic nabajɛ (nabāyih), translated by Nishio as
‘vacant land/empty lot,’ a word used in Jbāli Arabic to express the more general mean-
ing of place/spot (Nishio 1992: 154).
28
Nishio translates it as ‘weather’ (1992: 119). Etymologically connected with juwwa (inside)
and ‘juwwī’ (interior), al-jaww represents the intermediate level between sky and earth.
See Boris (1958: 94), žªó ‘ce qui est entre le ciel et la terre.’ Lane translates it as ‘the air […]
the atmosphere or what is between the heaven (or sky) and the earth’ (Lane 1968, vol. 3:

Ṣāniʿ can match the technical meaning of ‘space,’ i.e., the philosophical desig-
nation of a domain of experience that is the object of this work, an abstract
concept of space does now exist among the younger generations, and it is
derived from the most general term for ‘place’ found in the language (maṭraḥ).
Indeed, in the language of the elderly, maṭraḥindicates ‘place,’ ‘place of rest’
(Stewart 1990: 274). It is cross-generationally used in common sentences such
as wīn al-kubbāyih? ʿa-maṭraḥha! ‘where is the glass? It is in its place!’ That
is, the word is used by the elderly with the specific referential meaning of
‘something’s proper/own/usual place’ and its meaning has been extended over
time in the use of the younger generations. In fact, if we look at the seman-
tic boundaries between the concepts of ‘space,’ ‘room,’ and ‘place’ in English
and other languages, we see that the contexts and frequency of use of these
terms indicate language-specific distinctions. Thus, with respect to contem-
porary aṣ-Ṣāniʿ terminology, I can only approximately observe that the word
maṭraḥ, which somehow parallels the English meanings of ‘place,’ ‘room’ and
‘space,’ has been extended to mean ‘space,’ i.e., the semantic value of the word
maṭraḥ(and, to a smaller extent, ūsaʿ) has been extended over the last genera-
tions to meet new linguistic needs.

Temporal Frames of Reference
Theimpactof spatialorientationonourunderstandingof timehasbeenlargely
considered an obvious phenomenon, evident in grammars and lexica of many
world’s languages (Lyons 1977: 718; Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976: 375). Lakoff
assumes that our metaphorical understanding of time in terms of space is bio-
logically determined: ‘In our visual systems, we have detectors for motion and
detectors for objects/locations. We do not have detectors for time (…). Thus, it
makes good biological sense that time should be understood in terms of things
and motion (1993: 218).’ A number of cognitive and psycho-linguistic exper-
iments have been performed since this assumption was expressed, support-
ing the notion that to represent time, people around the world rely on space
(Boroditsky et al. 2010). Cross-linguistic and cross-cultural enquiry largely sup-
port the ‘space-to-time metaphor’ hypothesis, emphasizing that the ways in
which people spatialize time differ across languages and cultures, depending
on the available spatial representations, spatiotemporal metaphors, cultural
artifacts, and on individual disposition, age, and experience (Casasanto and
Boroditsky 2008; Fuhrman and Boroditsky 2010). In these studies, people from
different cultures have been shown to differ in whether they think of time as

from left to right, right to left, front to back, back to front, east to west, and so
on. For the grammatical marking of time on verbs, i.e., the domain of tense and
aspect, there is a sizable body of cross-linguistic research that shows that the
use of spatial periphrastic expressions is by no means geographically, geneti-
cally, or typologically limited (Anderson 1973, Traugott 1978).
Furthermore, a study conducted by Boroditsky and Gaby (2010) showed that
Australianlanguagesthatusecardinaldirectionstorepresentcognitiveandlin-
guisticspatialrelationsbetweenobjectsusedcardinaldirections(theeast/west
axis) in temporal representations, i.e., to express anteriority and posteriority
(before/after) between events. This was surprising, as all previous studies in
other cultures had found temporal representations derived from spatial repre-
sentations relative to the ego of the observer/speaker.
Nevertheless,the‘space-to-time’or‘space-first’hypothesishasrecentlybeen
challenged by the empirical evidence that humans directly perceive and feel
the passage of time (Evans 2004). This new perspective evokes the insight of
B.L. Whorf, who claimed that the Hopi language (an Uto-Aztecan language of
Arizona and New Mexico) does not conceive time in any known spatial shape
or direction (Whorf 1956: 146). In fact, Whorf studied the special Hopi con-
secution temporum, similar to that investigated in Maya languages by Bohne-
meyer (2009) and to that commonly used in Semitic languages, from Biblical
Hebrew to contemporary spoken Arabic varieties (Cook 2012; Owens 2006),
i.e., the main sentence is temporally marked, while the subordinate clauses
express time in relation to the main clause, not per se. But here I only consider
events like objects, and investigate linguistic and cognitive representations of
relations of anteriority/posteriority between events, considering the mental
representation of the ordinal sequence of temporal events as spatially orga-
nized in terms of relations between Fs and Gs (Gevers et al. 2003; Torralbo et
al. 2006). In this sense only, I look for analogies between spatial frames of ref-
erence and temporal representations, leaving aside the complex question of
temporal and aspectual values of actions and hinting with a few brief exam-
ples of how the passage of time is usually described in common expressions
meaning, for example, ‘last year’ or ‘next month,’ or ‘postpone’ or ‘anticipate.’ In
fact, in these cases, different types of metaphorical conceptualizations seem to
overlap in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, perhaps as remnants of systems that have followed
one another over time, as is commonly observed in various languages of differ-
ent linguistic families.
Surely, the domain of time embraces many more functions than merely
arranging events in order. Evans proposes a typology of temporal frames of ref-
erence, independent of static and dynamic spatial representations and exclu-
sive to the temporal domain (2004). I will briefly cover the issue of temporal

models and metaphors, as described by Evans (2004) and (2013), in chapter 4,
where the meanings of the front and back regions will be analyzed in spatial
and temporal terms, with and without implications in relation to the position
of the Observer and/or their distance from it. As for temporal cognition, the
results of the card-arranging and dot-placing tests (Boroditsky and Gaby 2010)
reveal that in taa, in addition to the front/back axis, cardinal directions are
also entailed and that for maa and yaa the right/left axis is increasingly used
instead of the front/back axis to represent relations of anteriority/posteriority.

Aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Space and Time: State of the Art and Aim of This Work
In this work, I focus on the linguistic and cognitive applications of spatial
and temporal frames of reference, as described in Levinson (2003), Bohne-
meyer (2011), Bohnemeyer and O’Meara (2012), and Boroditsky and Gaby
(2010), among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ tribal elders, today over seventy years old, in com-
parison to the other generations of the same tribe. I call the elders’ vari-
ety ‘traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic’ (henceforth, taa), to distinguish it from other
generational varieties considered in this book, namely Middle aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Ara-
bic (maa), whose speakers are aged forty to sixty, and Young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic
(yaa), whose speakers are aged twenty-five to thirty-nine. Data from speak-
ers younger than twenty-five are not included in a systematic manner in the
present work.
The three age groups under examination, comprising men and women,
represent three fundamental stages in the history of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ community
within the larger framework of the history of the Middle East and of the State
of Israel, i.e., three fundamental steps along the path of cultural change. The
above-mentioned generational partition proved to be valid and stable for the
spatial data represented here, yet it may not be valid for other linguistic and
cognitive fields, whose development and changes follow different rhythms, are
related to different factors, and are more or less open to different influences
than space. As I show in this book, aṣ-Ṣāniʿ spatial representations are influ-
enced by both language contacts and the modernization and transformation
of the material culture. Thus, the diachrony of change of aṣ-Ṣāniʿ spatial repre-
sentations over the last century strictly correlates with fundamental historical
processes that took place in the southern Levant during the creation of the
modern State of Israel (Nasasra et al. 2014) and to their socioeconomic and
cultural implications. Both linguistic and cognitive spatial representations are
treated here against the changing cultural background. As time is thought of
as based on linguistic and cognitive spatial representations (Clark 1973; Trau-

gott 1978; Tversky et al. 1991), I devote some central paragraphs and a final
chapter to the cross-generational examination of the temporal domain in lan-
guage and cognition, focusing on its dependence on the spatial domain (chap-
ter 9).
Theinvestigationof thelanguageof spaceamongtheelderlyaṣ-Ṣāniʿincom-
parison to the language of the younger generations yielded the unprecedented
opportunity to observe and describe two distinctively recognizable stages in
the history of the language of a community that has maintained itself as a
homogeneous genetic and social entity throughout the challenging events of
the last century, until the abruptly accelerating acculturation process of the
last two decades changed this situation.
My previous study on aṣ-Ṣāniʿ referential strategies (Cerqueglini 2015) was
based on the typology of the referential strategies proposed by Levinson (2003)
and attempted to account for the strategies that underlie the selection and dis-
tribution of the relative frame of reference, in particular of the aligned field, a
subcategory of the relative frame of reference, first detected in the Hausa lan-
guage, in language (Hill 1982).
The data presented in this work represent the answers given by the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
informants to where-questions about the position of a given object (Figure)
in relation to a second one (Ground) by means of different kinds of con-
trolled stimuli (mainly based on Levinson et al. 1992) and their non-linguistic
responses to a set of experiments performed by Levinson (2003) and Li and
Gleitman (2002).The temporal domain is explored based on Boroditsky (2000)
andBoroditskyandGaby(2010)foritscognitivecounterpart.Manynewexperi-
ments and modifications of previous ones were devised for the purposes of this
research.
With regard to the elderly speakers’ community, new experimental findings
are shown here in relation to those presented in 2015, presenting a deeper
exploration of the cognitive reflexes of the prepositional network and show-
ing the clear impact of prepositional etymologies on the linguistic matching
between the prepositions themselves and the referential strategies. The role
of frames of reference and culture in the paths of prepositional grammati-
calization is outlined here, both for the language of the elderly community
and across the other two generations, representing a noteworthy contribution
to both theoretical models of grammaticalization and, more specifically on a
sociohistorical level, to the field of Arabic dialectology.
In 2015, on the basis of the data collected in the traditional variety spoken
by the elders, I highlighted the fact that, beyond the well-known centrality
of the realia and their properties in human space processing, the attribution
of features and ontological properties to objects in the real world can unex-

pectedly and significantly differ across cultures. The categories for encoding
the conceptual notions of space into language definitively shed light on the
ways in which physical perceptions and interactions, cognitive and linguistic
processes, and cultures are connected in the human experience of space, open-
ing the debate to an unprecedented perspective on grammatical embodiment.
In the present work, I deepen the conceptualization and linguistic represen-
tations of spatial and temporal regions and prepositions, approaching them
in relation to their etymological sources, often found in human and animal
bodies, and comparing them with data from related Bedouin tribes within
the Negev and Sinai and beyond, across Africa and Asia. I also report experi-
mental observations on the progressive loss of relation to the etymology that
prepositions and adverbs undergo over the generations, which leads them to
move away from their original meanings, linked to human and animal bod-
ies. The semantic departure from the origin diminishes the coercive force of
the etymology, so prepositions are used by middle-aged and young speakers
in correlation with wider sectors of the lexicon, unlike what happens among
the elderly. This phenomenon points to the disappearance of the traditional
ontologies according to which entities were classified in order to formulate lin-
guistic spatial representations.
From the methodological and formal perspectives, the experimental analy-
sis of a referential system and the semantic rules that shape it has only a few,
and quite different, precedents (some Central American and Australian lan-
guages), all outside the Afroasiatic family, with the exception of one article
by Hill (1982), where the author compares the evidence of the ‘aligned field’
strategy in English and Hausa (of the Chadic branch of the Afroasiatic fam-
ily). The cross-generational analysis of the evolution of the spatiotemporal
system in language and cognition is, to the best of my knowledge, unprece-
dented.
The description of the evolution of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ referential system across
generations and of the role of material life and culture in this process consti-
tutesanexampleof theborrowingof asociostructuralistapproachbycognitive
linguistic studies. This theoretical combination should be further exploited
with different linguistic and cultural groups to produce comparative data on
the relationships between language, cognition, and culture. Indeed, the the-
oretical outline that emerges from the analysis of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ data may not
be generally extendable to other languages and cognitive systems. More rad-
ically, the transferability of cognitive models across cultures and languages,
despite their historical, sociological, and geographical specificity, remains an
open question. This work thus represents the first research on referential spa-
tial semantics in a Semitic language. The historical and ecological experience

of a group of Arab nomads in the Negev sands appears in this semantic pro-
file as a unique and exceptional cultural elaboration, now vanishing rapidly
and irreversibly. The semantic description offered in this work is so packed
with theoretical implications as to naturally represent the nucleus for further
investigations in several directions of inquiry. Yet, this unique stage repre-
sents in itself a milestone of substantial fieldwork data, on whose foundation
a completely new perspective on the human processing of spatial domain can
develop.
The results of this investigation shed light on the reasons for the cross-
generational evolution of referential systems and its trajectories, focusing on
transformations in material life as the catalysts of linguistic and cognitive
change. Indeed, the outline of the distribution of referential strategies among
the elders shows a culture-based and domain-exclusive ontology, unpre-
dictable outside the speakers’ community, according to which real entities are
classified for locative purposes. On the basis of such evaluation, each frame of
reference can be exclusively applied to certain Ground objects and exclusively
combined with specific prepositions (prepositional split). Culture-specific fea-
tures of Ground objects override other distinctive parameters, such as symme-
try, size, facedness, and mobility, generally considered universal determinants,
and determine prepositional agreement. The entire system collapses over time
in subsequent stages.
The youngest members of the tribe use fewer referential strategies than the
elders and select them according to parameters that are irreversibly and quali-
tativelydifferentfromthoseof theoldspatialontology.Furthermore,turningto
the grammatical expressions of spatial relations, in the language of the elders,
as more grammatical strategies correspond to the application of the relative
and absolute frames of reference, depending on the Ground object and on the
perspective of the observer (O), I hypothesized, already in 2015, a split between
linguistic and cognitive parameters and strategies in the traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
referential system. The mismatch between linguistic and cognitive strategies
is confirmed here, even more strikingly, across the other two generations and
supported by recent cross-linguistic data (Bohnemeyer et al. 2022).
This study also focuses on the use of local landmarks to anchor geocentric
referential strategies across the generations. The use of landmarks to anchor
cardinal directions or as references for fixed directions is today part of the
study of the spatial coordinate systems called frames of reference in language,
culture, and cognition, which has been developed in the framework of the rela-
tivistic and deterministic Neo-Whorfian renaissance, with its various currents,
some extreme, some less extreme, in the second half of the twentieth century
(Marotta 2010).

chapter 2
Thanks to spatial studies on the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, in comparison to other popula-
tions, we can now affirm that systems of geocentric references are enduring
in cognition across generations, even after their disappearance from language
(Bohnemeyer et al. 2022; Cerqueglini 2019; Cerqueglini 2022). This means that
linguistic and cognitive systems may change at different times and do not
always reflect one another exactly. When an absolute system decays, first com-
petence in cardinal orientation is extinguished, then competence linked to the
directions of the local familiar landmarks, as is the case of middle-aged and
young speakers, as I show here.
The loss of absolute references in language outside the familiar territory
could be an adaptive consequence of modern sedentary life, based on high-
speed car journeys along fixed paths. But many other elements come into play
in this linguistic transformation, including the development of right/left oppo-
sition, perhaps linked to the practices of writing and driving vehicles, literacy,
and contact with linguistic systems that are devoid of absolute spatial sys-
tems, such as the Palestinian dialects of the sedentary Levantine communities,
Hebrew, and European languages. Cognition, as mentioned, seems strikingly
more resistant to change. As for the dependency of time on space, the ques-
tion seems also quite complex, with material culture and its transformations
playing an even more significant role with regard to this more abstract domain
than with regard to space.
From a philosophical point of view, the results of this exploration in linguis-
tic diversity bring us outside and far beyond the epistemological mainstream
direction imposed by the universalism vs. determinism dispute, which has so
far prevailed in the panorama of domain-based approaches toward language-
to-cognition correlation, largely constraining the data observed across lan-
guages and cultures within the scope of typological classifications. Outside this
conceptuallandscape,thepresentworkproposesanewversionof therelativis-
tic theory, beyond Whorf, i.e., without deterministic implications. Indeed, the
nature and constraining force of the relations between language and cogni-
tion may themselves dramatically vary across languages and cultures, and may
themselves represent a cultural variable.

and other ethnic and cultural habits and traditions seems to have fostered
within these groups the stabilization of deep semantic groundwork structures,
such as those pertaining to the encoding of spatial relations. Genetic, cultural,
and territorial conservatism, which have led to an interesting and rich set of
semantic strategies that describe spatial relations, and the relatively recent
move from a nomadic to a sedentary lifestyle motivated me to conduct my
fieldwork with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ. During my stay among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, I found that
elderly speakers pervasively use cardinal directions to locate objects on small
scale in day-to-day talk, i.e., they use geocentric strategies of referential fram-
ing. Nonetheless, the intrinsic and the relative frames of reference are also in
use: i.e., traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic shows the complete inventory of frames of
reference described by Levinson (2003) and even by Bohnemeyer (2011), with
the range contracting progressively among the younger speakers, as I show
here.
The more this research progressed over the years, the more the taa refer-
ential system proved to be a unique case. For comparative purpose, I extended
my survey to encompass the entire southern Levantine area and also account
here for the data yielded from other Bedouin varieties within and outside the
Negev and the sedentary Arabic dialects of nearby areas (mainly Palestine and
Egypt).
This survey represents a unique case in the study of spatial referential prac-
tices thanks to its methodological, geographical, and chronological scope—
almost a century and three generations. Furthermore, with the exception of
Hill’s article on Hausa (1982) and Mauro Tosco’s article (2009) on Gawwada,
this is the first work entirely devoted to cognitive spatial orientation and refer-
ential practices within the Afroasiatic sprachraum.
Undoubtedly, the taa referential system is similar in many ways to others
described worldwide (Brown and Levinson 1993a, b; Bohnemeyer 2011; Palmer
2002).Yetitsstructureandnature,itsselectioncriteriaof framesof referencein
language, and the relationship in it between linguistic and cognitive represen-
tations show striking and unique features, as detailed elsewhere (Cerqueglini
2015). Therefore, it is quite challenging to take a final, clear-cut position within
the millennial dispute on the existence of universal or language-specific repre-
sentations.
Turning to the genealogical perspective, within the Semitic linguistic family,
only Arabic Bedouin languages show full dominance of spatial representations
anchored in cardinal directions or other fixed bearings, such as geographical
landmarks, in daily speech and small-scale location. This type of anchoring
strategy, extensively described in Levinson (2003) as absolute frames of refer-
ence, seems absent from other Semitic languages across the Middle East and

Africa today, yet we cannot really account for the past. Written Ugaritic attes-
tations, for example, do not insist on cardinal references, with the exception
of Mount Ṣap̱ūn, probably used to indicate a northern location and the north
itself, and whose name echoes the Hebrew word for ‘north’ (ṣāfōn), detectable
today even in the Modern Hebrew word maṣpen ‘compass.’31
Urban sedentary cultures of ancient Iraq, the Levant, Syria, and Arabia seem
to extensively use body-based referential strategies on the horizontal plane, as
the high frequency of prepositions such as ‘in front of,’ ‘behind,’ ‘to the right
of,’ ‘to the left of’ in the written sources demonstrates (Beeston 1984; Blau
2010; Esseesy 2010; Gai 1985; Hardy 2015; Huehnergard 2011; Mācelaru 2003;
Mengozzi 2005; Pardee 1976). Cardinal directions seem to correlate in these
languages only to the description of arrays on the geographic scale, astronom-
ical observations, ritual practices, and omens (Horowitz 1998; Kugler 1909/10;
Lizorkin-Eyzenberg 2017; Mateus 2009; Neumann 1977; O’Connor 2008; Roth
2019; Tallqvist 1928). In fact, names for astronomical directions, wind direc-
tions, and prominent landmarks are found in all the ancient Semitic civiliza-
tions, undoubtedly with high saliency and rich semantic implications (Izre’el
2001; Williams 2008). In particular, among sedentary or sedentarized popula-
tions, cardinal direction terms are redundantly multiplied by their associations
withlocalfixedbearings,asinBiblicalandMedievalHebrewandseveralseden-
tary Arabic dialects (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2016; O’Connor 1992; Roth 2019).
Yet there is not sufficient evidence to prove the use of geocentric strategies
in small-scale location and orientation, as in the Bedouin Arabic varieties still
spoken today.
31
One of the Hebrew words for ‘north,’ ṣāfōn, may derive from the place name Ṣafōn, prob-
ably derived from ṣ.p.y. ‘to watch (from a lookout),’ from which Hebrew ṣofe ‘watcher/
observer,’ or ‘to be clear/limpid,’ as Arabic ṣāfī ‘pure,’ or ‘to hide’ as in Qumran Aramaic.
In the Qumran text 4Q209 is said: ‘They call the north ṣippūn, because in it all the vessels
of heaven hide, and gather, and revolve’ (Cook 2015: 201). Ṣafōn was a northern moun-
tainous outpost, often mentioned in the Ugaritic literature. It can be considered as a
culture word in the ancient Levant. The Modern Hebrew word maṣpen, from the same
root as ‘north,’ was coined to indicate ‘compass’ by the grammarian David Yellin (1864–
1941; Harmati 2000: 48). The etymological derivation of ‘compass’ from ‘north’ is in fact
uncommon, eventhough ‘north’ and ‘orientation/direction’ (also as ‘sanity’) are often as-
sociateincommonsayings(Italian:perderelabussola,lit.‘tolosethecompass’andperdere
la tramontana, lit. ‘to lose the north wind,’ i.e., ‘to miss the north,’ both mean ‘to become
insane’). It is unclear to me which language Yellin was inspired by in creating his neol-
ogism (It. bussola ‘boxel, small box,’ cfr. > Arabic buṣla; Eng. compass; Rus. kомпас; Pol.
kompas).

85
From a broader perspective, looking at the Afroasiatic linguistic phylum,
some interesting studies have been conducted in the field on spatial referential
strategies, starting from Hill’s (1986) work on Hausa,32 which led to the discov-
ery of the so called ‘Hausa System’ or ‘aligned field’ through the more recent
work by Tosco (2009) on Gawwada, an East-Cushitic language that highlighted
for the first time the presence of geocentric orientation strategies in an African
language. Tosco himself reported on the scarcity of referential descriptions in
African languages at the time of publication of his work on Gawwada (Tosco
2009: 531).
Regarding the similarities with Hausa, aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders use the so-called
Hausasystemastheonlystrategyaccordingtowhichtherelativeframeof refer-
ence is applied along the front/back axis,33 i.e., when both Figure and Ground
objects are aligned along the visual field of the observer, or, in other words,
when Figure, Ground, and Observer are aligned as if proceeding in a parade.
The condition of alignment between both entities of the spatial scene and
observer is a necessary prerequisite for the application of the aligned field, as
shown in more detail in chapter 6.
As for the similarities between the traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ referential system
and Gawwada,Tosco emphasizes that Gawwada operates on an absolute frame
of reference34 based upon a vertical opposition between ‘uphill’ (kut-e) and
‘downhill’ (kal-e) with a third element bisecting the plane at the horizontal
level (kor-e). ‘Uphill’ corresponds to a general northeast direction, and ‘down-
hill,’ correspondingly, is centered around the southwest (Tosco 2009: 524) and
they are used irrespectively of the reciprocal vertical position of two entities.
The author underlines the fact that the cardinal system of Gawwada resem-
bles that analyzed by Penelope Brown in her study on the grammar of space
of Tzeltal Maya of Chiapas (2006a: 265; also 2008), and summarizes it in Fig-
ure 10.
A similar type of uphill/downhill orientation field is found in Jbāli (Nishio
1992), centered on the upstream/downstream orientation of the wadi and its
valley around the Saint Catherine’s Monastery in the Sinai, as shown in detail
in chapter 4. Body parts are not grammaticalized in Gawwada as spatial regions
and prepositions. Neither do ‘right’ and ‘left’ become prepositions, as their use

The right/left axis is not developed.

Tosco uses the tripartite typology proposed by Levinson (2003), including intrinsic, rela-
tive, and absolute frames of reference. In this work, as stated above, I adopt Bohnemeyer’s
classification of referential strategies, according to which the absolute types defined by
Levinson are labeled geocentric, together with other subtypes.

The Gawwada Orientation Field
from tosco (2009: 524)
is confined to discriminate both human hands, as happens in traditional aṣ-
Ṣāniʿ Arabic (Cerqueglini 2015).
More interestingly, through the use of special suffixes, -á (out) indicates
centrifugalvalueandcentripetal-ú(in)of thecardinalprepositions.Lookingat
the examples reported below (Tosco 2009: 527), one can understand that both
values are calculated with respect to the observer’s position, i.e., they have a
deictic value with respect to the speaker’s position:
kor-á
straight-out
ʾašš-a
go-imp.2sg
‘walk there (across, to that side)!’
kat-á
downhill-out
ʾašš-a
go-imp.2sg
‘go down!’ (away from here in the downhill direction).
Gawwada can produce cardinal (or geocentric) representations that include
deictic (or relative) information. This is something that traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
informants can also do, marking the presence of deictic information through
the use of various prepositional compounds that include the prepositional
head min, ‘from,’ as we will see in chapter 7.
In particular, as shown below, aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders can distinguish whether or not
fgo are aligned along the same cardinal axis, the east/west or the north/south
axis. This seems to be exactly the case for both following examples as well,
Tosco explained (2009: 528):
In the following sentence the objects are roughly lined from either the
west to the east or from the east to the west, in the relative order: in the
first sentence the order is speaker →Chabo →house; in the second sen-
tence, the order is the opposite: speaker →house →Chabo

‘Chabo is behind Guna’s house.’
Furthermore, the opposition between centrifugal and centripetal suffixes is
used to distinguish the reciprocal facing direction of two-faced objects; with
the addressee facing (i.e., towards) the speaker, centripetal -ú will be used; the
use of centrifugal -á involves both entities facing in the same direction:
ʾato

‘you are in front of me’ (I am facing you);
ʾato
idp.2sg
yela
obl.1sg
kor-á
straight-out
‘you are ahead of me’ (I am behind you).
The same distinction between ‘in front’ meaning that two faced entities arefac-
ing each other and ‘in front’ meaning that one is ahead of the other are found in
the language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders in the distinction operated by the use of gabl
and giddām, both generally translated as ‘in front of.’ The conditions of align-
ment between both entities in the spatial scene and in relation to the position
of the speaker are further codified by the use of simple prepositions, preposi-
tional compounds used with min as prepositional heads, as shown in chapter 5,
and what I call ‘min chains,’ another prepositional strategy, described in chap-
ters 5, 6, and 7.
I mention these data from a different language belonging to the same
Afroasiatic phylum as Bedouin Arabic varieties, because, looking for studies

resentations are also found in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic and are typologically
rare.ThistypologicalsimilaritybetweenGawwadaandtraditionalaṣ-ṢāniʿAra-
bic may have nothing to do with belonging to the same phylum and I do not
attempt in this book to formulate any theoretical implications for the pro-
posed comparisons. The striking similarities found in both these Afroasiatic
languages and in Hausa are important, but the genetic distance between them
is still significant and causality could still be evoked to explain their intriguing
similarities, at least as long as the scientific platforms lack research on other
Afroasiatic languages. The diffusion of the same semantic distinctions, such
as the bias toward encoding the alignment of the scene’s elements with the
observer or describing scenes in both cardinal and deictic terms at once, over
other languages of the same Afroasiatic phylum, could support the existence of
genetic tendencies in the linguistic and cognitive organization of spatial rep-
resentations, a topic has never been thoroughly explored, to the best of my
knowledge.
Nevertheless, Tosco warns that Gawwada’s grammar of space is not an iso-
lated case, and that other closely related languages show the same tripartite
axial system of locally anchored geocentric representations. Indeed, in 1986,
Sasse mentioned a deictic system based upon the landscape as an areal feature
of the Southwest Ethiopia linguistic area (Sasse 1986). In the same general area
of Southwest Ethiopia, a system apparently strikingly similar to the Gawwada
one has been discovered in other Cushitic and Omotic languages, also Afroasi-
atic. Konso, an East-Cushitic language belonging to the Oromoid group seems
very similar to Gawwada (Dauday and Hellenthal 2004). Konso is also the best-
described language in this regard. More to the North, the Omotic languages
Dawuro (Hirut 2001), Gamo (Hirut 2007), and Maale (Azeb 2001), all belonging
to the Ometo subgroup, as well as South Omotic Dime (Seyoum 2008), have
beenreportedtohavesimilarsystems.Giventhebasicandprimarycharacterof

On the one hand, Cecil Brown (1983), investigating the spatial terms for the
cardinal directions and finding them extremely heterogeneous from the ety-
mological point of view within the same language families, was led to affirm
their relatively recent development in the lexicon of the various attested lan-
guages examined in his study. On the other hand, given the diffusion of geo-
centric strategies throughout the different language families, Bohnemeyer et
al. (2014) hypothesized a common ancestral phase of diffusion of geocentric
strategies. The question remains open.
While spatial representations in language and cognition from a compara-
tive perspective are not frequently studied with regard to Semitic languages,

Society, Culture, and Methodology

A Culture in Decline: Gender Groups and Age Groups
Developing linguistic fieldwork methodology is a difficult task, as it requires
performing experiments in different cultures while maintaining comparabil-
ity (Levinson 2003). As I investigated linguistic spatial frames of reference
in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, my informants’ responses led me to incorpo-
rate culture-specific experimental design and tools into standard methodol-
ogy, with remarkable outcomes. The same types of stimuli were also tested on
middle-aged and young informants to keep results consistent. Faced with the
same stimuli, the different generations responded in strikingly different ways,
highlighting the effects of modernization and change on material culture, edu-
cation, and training in writing and drawing practices and map reading. I also
discuss here the changes I implemented in the original methodology and their
impact on research and theory on frames of reference.
The goal of my fieldwork investigation, conducted between 2012 and 2015,
was to describe the linguistic representations of spatial frames of reference in
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic in order to contribute to the debate over universal vs. language-
relative spatial representations, language relative vs. universal cognition, and
the role of culture in the debate. This problem is framed within the more com-
plex psychological and philosophical question regarding the universal vs. the
linguistic-relative nature of concepts, known in the Middle Ages as the quæstio
de universalibus (the problem of the universals), which has fascinated West-
ern philosophy from its beginnings. In modern times, the existence of different
conceptual codifications of reality and the hypothesis that such cultural dif-
ferences may be the effects of language on non-linguistic thought entered the
linguistic debate with the writings of B.L. Whorf. The nucleus of his thought
consists of the observation that languages shape non-linguistic mental activ-
ity (habitual thought) and experience (reality) according to their distinctive
categories (1956). Whorf’s linguistic relativity assumes that non-linguistic rep-
resentations emerge from the use of certain linguistic expressions (Gumperz
and Levinson 1996; Lucy 1992). The domain of color categories presented the
most serious challenges to Whorfian determinism. Indeed, similarity in color
cognition has been detected cross-linguistically, despite variations in color lan-
guage (Heider 1972; Lucy and Shweder 1979; Kay and Kempton 1984). Nonethe-
less, other domains, such as spatial (Levinson 2003) and temporal (Borodit-

sky 2000) representations, classifiers (Imai and Gentner 1997; Lucy 1992), and
grammatical gender (Boroditsky 2006) revealed cross-linguistic differences in
thought. These results highlight the possibility that the constraining force of
linguistic categories on cognitive categories is domain-related, i.e., the less the
domain depends on sensory experience, the stronger the influence of language
on thought, or, in other words, language influences thought more in more
abstract domains (Boroditsky 2000).Today, less deterministic claims are gener-
ally accepted (Boroditsky 2001; Bowerman 1996; Davidoff et al. 1999; Dehaene
et al. 1999), emphasizing how languages seem to differ in the ways in which
theyconstrainspeakersinattendingtoandencodingdifferentaspectsof reality
(Boroditsky 2006; Sapir 1921; Slobin 1996), possibly leading to different kinds of
minds and world experiences. Some still support the validity of universal and
innate concepts (Li and Gleitman 2002), maintaining that cognitive and lin-
guistic representations are basically the same across languages and cultures,
with the exception of superficial variations (Munnich et al. 2001; Regier and
Carlson 2001).
Since my research, according to my first plan, was supposed to focus exclu-
sively on the description of the data representing the traditional language of
the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, I started selecting my informants from among the oldest available
men. I argued that they were traditionally the most mobile element of Bedouin
society, since they still took part in short- and long-distance migrations, and
probably also had the greatest competence in the original spatial semantics
and the most extensive memory of it. By chance, since the number of elderly
people was somehow lower than I had expected it to be (I had a limited num-
ber of informants over age seventy), I extended my interest to younger speakers
and discovered significant differences between the groups. As Levinson states,
‘Many of the communities studied in our cross-cultural survey are small ethnic
groups under recent but growing pressure of acculturation by larger national
communities or urban influences. One might therefore expect that younger
subjects, or those with greater education, might have adapted more than older
conservative subjects to the predominantly […] coding tendencies in the larger
linguistic communities around them’ (2003: 196).
Thus, in accordancewith myobservations,for the presentenquiry,I selected
twenty informants for each of three age groups. Within each age group, the
informants were selected according to the two genders culturally recognized
in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ society: men (ten) and women (ten), in equal number.The three age
groups reflect cultural and linguistic specificities:
Group 1. The elderly: those born in Širīʿih before 1953 (over age seventy);
Group 2. The middle-aged (approximately 40 to 60 years old): those

born in Tel ʿArad between the mid-nineteen fifties (1953) and the
return to Ligīyih beginning in 1975;
Group 3. The youngest: those born in Ligīyih after 1975 (under age 40).
These informants comprised the population tested in all tests represented in
this book. They remain anonymous. The photographs and videos portraying
them during the experiments are not published here, in accordance with our
preliminary agreement and in observance of their customary rules and beliefs.

cies recognizable in each age group.
My questions regarding the age of my informants elicited interesting obser-
vations. The oldest generations did not keep exact records of their age. In most
cases, there were sons and daughters who could tell me the age of their par-
ents, which they were able to reconstruct adding to the age of the first born the
approximate age of the parents at the moment of his or her birth. The elderly
informants reported that they were unable to remember their ages and made
no effort to calculate them.
As already said, the age groups examined represent three fundamental
stages in the history of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ community within the larger framework of
the history of the Middle East and the State of Israel, and therefore, three fun-
damental steps along the path of cultural change. The people in Group 1 were
born in tents, most of them probably at the end of the winters in the camp
of Širīʿih, and received basic education that consisted mainly of rote learning
of passages from the Koran and some arithmetic taught by the tribal teacher.
Only one member of this age group left the traditional occupation of sheep
farming to go and study abroad and become the village’s physician, encour-
aged by his father. The people in Group 2 share many common linguistic traits
and features with the members of Group 1, since they still live in the village in
close proximity to the elderly. Yet their analysis of spatial arrays presents some
significant signs of change. Interestingly, on some occasions, when the elderly
and middle-aged informants were present together in a fieldwork session, the
former often criticized the answers of the latter, saying that their sentences
did not fit the description of the proposed spatial array or that they made
no sense. This age group had never lived a nomadic life. Many of them were
educated in standard Arabic and Hebrew and work as professionals, while oth-
ers are employed in Israeli factories. Group 3 consisted of young people born
after the return to Ligīyih. Most of them receive higher education and are sent
abroad to study medical or law. Their generational culture is highly influenced

by a dominant sentiment of pan-Arabic belonging and their language reflects
the influence of the sedentary culture that is permeating Palestinian Arabic
dialects.
When I extended my enquiry to the female population, my expectations
with respect to the differences between men and women in terms of activities,
the related differences in degree of mobility, and the impact of these on their
language were shown to be mistaken. Despite the fact that women live their
lives mainly within the home and among close relatives and women’s oral tra-
dition and storytelling style differ from those of men (Henkin 2010), Bedouin
women of every age speak about space using exactly the same semantic strate-
gies as men do, without relevant discrepancies in frequency and quantity. The
oldest women were skilled at riding horses and camels, the matriarchs proudly
reported, since they had often had to look after the animals at a distance from
the village, and could use weapons to defend their honor and the flocks, while
the younger women drive cars today. The older women were as familiar with
their surroundings as the older men were.1
Therefore, from a methodological point of view, the three aforementioned
age groups could thus include men and women. Thus, in accordance with the
previous generational division, I interviewed six informants from Group 1, four
from Group 2, and four from Group 3.
The only relevant difference between men and women was the relatively
diminished familiarity of the older women with urban geography. Once I asked
a woman over age ninety where she had gone that morning. She said that her
son had accompanied her to an office in Beer-Sheva. I asked where this office
was located in order to know how she would describe the path. She said, ‘It is
where the green (garbage) bins are.’This response indicated that my informant
did not imagine that the garbage bins could be considered reference points,
since they are located all over every urban area and not only in front of the
office she visited.
Manyotherobjectsof modernlife,suchasrefrigerators,werequiteunknown
to my oldest informants. Some of them still wondered how their grandchil-
dren could eat old food stored in ice. Observing the interaction of the different
age groups with material objects that characterized the old lifestyle and the
modern one was a key element in the detection of the forces behind linguistic
1 This is not a common trend. During my fieldwork in the Sangih Islands, while men consis-
tently used the astronomical directions as references to indicate the projective (or angular)
relations between objects on every scale, women (and children) often referred to their bodies
as the anchoring structures of the coordinate system.

change,inparticularwithrespecttothelanguageof space.Itseems,infact,that
cultural change, promoted by the interaction with new, commonly used imple-
ments, also influences linguistic change. And very interestingly, it also appears
that the greatest and most profound change has occurred in the last fifty years
within the female gender group.
Indeed, from a situation of exclusion from literacy practices, in less than fifty
years, young women have reached the highest educational levels, and in larger
numbers in proportion to young men, confirming a stable trend that began
in the nineties (Sacchi 2003: 15; Fargues 2010: 464–465). Women fight strenu-
ously to be educated and are very proud of reaching high social and economic
positions via the educational path; this achievement represents to them liber-
ation from the traditional role of the Bedouin woman. This datum contradicts
the general assumption that women represent the most conservative sectors of
society, and the situation seems to vary across societies and depend on cultural
and social norms and historical scenarios.

Stimulus Selection: A Work in Progress
The spontaneous reactions of my informants with respect to the instruments
employed in my fieldwork guided me in probing cultural differences and revis-
ing the general methodology for spatial enquiry developed by Levinson and his
research group in the last twenty years. My elderly informants’ reactions and
doubts certainly served to shape this research. In testing the semantic framing
of static angular spatial relations, i.e., the distribution of the spatial frames of
reference, I began my research willing to use images, i.e., pictures of different
arrays, as stimuli. It is very easy to collect a great number of different and inter-
esting arrays, set in various landscapes, with variable size, proportions, scales,
and light conditions, by downloading pictures from movie scenes, documen-
taries, books, and paintings, or taking specially customized pictures of objects
in natural or unnatural, appropriate or inappropriate contexts stored in the
memory of a computer.
Showing pictures is also convenient because it is possible to arrange them
in a specific order, so that, using a tape recorder, without resorting to video
recording, it is possible to univocally associate the images shown one after the
other in a precise order with the descriptions of the informants, without hav-
ing to worry about inventing arrays on the spot during the recording session
or moving objects, holding the camera in the right position, moving one’s self,
and recording everything properly. According to the authors themselves, the
stimulus series of Levinson et al. (1992) are thought of as card games to play

with more than one informant, in the forms of tasks of the type of ‘photo–
photo matching’ (1992: 7).
I began my fieldwork using four different kinds of picture stimuli, which
I called two-dimensional indirect stimuli (representations of real objects in
the form of pictures designed to be shown on the computer screen or as
printed photos). However, from the initial stages of my research, I realized that
culture-related stimuli produce culture-related answers; consistently, a more
abstract stimulus produces a more abstract and less culture-related answer,
so different series of diverse stimuli are a crucial playing field in which major
insights regarding the relationship between language and cognition should be
tested and elaborated, taking into consideration cultural and environmental
specificities. Thus, I proceeded to classify picture stimuli into three categories:
1. non-culture-related stimulus pictures, 2. culture-related stimulus pictures
(scenestakenfromBedouinlife),and3.artificialstimuluspictures(experimen-
tal arrays in non-arbitrary positions, i.e., conceived to elicit specific distinctive
features). The three types are shown in Figure 11.
2.1
Limitations in Using Images: Interpreting the Rules of Perspective
After several attempts, however, I noticed that the images shown on the com-
puter screen were often not recognized as two-dimensional representations of
three-dimensional entities and therefore were not processed according to the
geometric and ontological semantic rules commonly used in the treatment of
concrete spatial arrays. They were simply treated as two-dimensional objects.
This happened especially with older and middle-aged women. In addition,
measures, proportions, distances, and relative positions of objects in pictures
werenotalwaysrecognizedascluestoperspectiverulestobeappliedbydefault
in order to properly read images in two-dimensional layouts. A selection of
responses of this type is shown in Figure 12.
2.2
Distinguishing ‘Scene’ from ‘Photo’
The position of the picture automatically affected the interpretation of the
portrayed subject. For example, when the images were shown on the com-
puter screen, the most prevalent dimension observed and reported by the
elderly informants was usually the vertical one, while the relative position of
the objects portrayed in the same images was interpreted along the horizontal
plane when the pictures were placed on the floor or on a table in front of the
informants, as shown in the examples reported in Figure 13 for the computer
version of the experiment. We could thus say that, somehow, space is indeed
the place where things are set or placed, and interpretation of the location of
entities, which are represented on a second entity, such as the picture, requires

whichTzeltal speakers of Tenejapa process image reading, Levinson notes that:
‘[…] just as in Guugu Yimithirr, the virtual world of a photograph inherits the
cardinal directions of its orientation in the real world’ (2003: 151).This could be
the consequence of the use of cardinal directions as means of semantic fram-

Understanding Human Interactions in Pictures
Often, I noted that my informants did not even recognize in the pictures the
attitudes of the portrayed subjects and the meanings of their interactions,
perhaps as a consequence of difficulties in interpreting the rules of perspec-
tive, which are necessary for interpreting two-dimensional representations of
three-dimensional objects. I created stimuli by taking pictures of two men and
instructing them to adopt precise attitudes, such as speaking to each other or
facing each other, and so on. Nonetheless, many of the informants did not rec-
ognize any human interaction in the portrayed images, as we can see from the
examples reported in Figure 14.

chapter 3
I wondered why my informants did not recognize the interactions and atti-
tudes of the models portrayed in the pictures and why they were so cautious
in describing them in spatial terms. They behaved as if they were not actually
sure about the quality and type of the interactions between the portrayed peo-
ple. Somehow, they could not properly judge these facts just by looking at the
pictures. Many other elements of natural observation were apparently lacking
for the informants to be able to describe what was actually going on between
the two models.
One of the explanations for my informants’ responses is that perhaps speak-
ing about the positions of two or more people in relation to each other entails
thedescriptionof theirfeelings,intentions,andattitudes.InItalian‘fronteggia-
rsi’ or ‘affrontarsi,’ said of two people or animals, mean not only ‘to stand in
front of each other,’ but also ‘to challenge each other,’ ‘to confront,’ which is not
the case if we speak about two palaces or about the two shutters of a wooden
window. Thus, hypothetically, if it is not possible to judge the feelings of the
people portrayed, it is consequently difficult to describe their relative positions
while avoiding metaphorical implications.
Nevertheless, when the people portrayed were Bedouin, the images were
more easily recognized as real-life scenes occurring or having occurred in real-
ity. Both women and men were more confident in speaking about these, refer-
ring to the activities of the people portrayed and guessing about the cultural
context of the events—if it was a wedding or a circumcision ceremony or a
scene from the market or a declaration of war—and about many other ele-
ments, and began telling stories and comparing the scenes in the pictures with
their own experience and memories. And, incredibly, it became possible to ask
my basic questions about spatial relations, such as: ‘Where is this person in
relation to this other person?’ or ‘Where is the boiler in relation to the fire?’
and easily obtain meaningful answers. The same happened when the pictures
contained familiar people portrayed in known places.

sometimes recognize the real places where the pictures had been taken, espe-

at home, smiled, and were happy to know the place and to be able to give me
a real concrete and correct answer, which could be of some use to me! In other
words, my questions finally ‘made sense’ to them.
In fact, some of them wondered why I came and asked them to describe
where a given X-person or object was located in relation to an unknown Y part

in Bali. One informant, sitting in front of a picture of a green Indonesian hill,
candidly admitted not knowing that place, and thus being unable to describe
the scene in terms of spatial relations, as shown in Figure 15.
As with the pictures that represented people, I found it incredible and diffi-
cult to understand why unknown geographical elements could prime in many
of my informants, mainly the oldest men and women, the feeling of not know-
ing how to properly answer simple questions about spatial relations. Things
became clearer when I started taking pictures of the surrounding pre-desert
and desert environment, certainly known to my informants, and showing the
photographs to them. My elderly (men and women) and middle-aged (mainly
men) informants could tell me exactly where the place was located and were

reported in Figure 16.
In Figure 16, my informant recognized the place and its real astronomical
orientation. We were facing north during the experiment, so, if the situation
of the task had been at all relevant, the informant would have said that the
mountain was north of the car, but he respected the actual position of the
mountain. Indeed, when geographical elements are involved in the description
of spatial arrays, the use of the astronomical coordinate system seems to be
obligatory. My informants know the orientation of the geographical elements
of the familiar territory, so they can use them as anchoring points of the astro-
nomical coordinates and locate objects in relation to them accordingly. In this
sense, they feel they know the places and can speak accurately about them. To
conclude, as Levinson et al. recognized (1992: 8), picture series present evident
limitations, so that they can be used only for exploratory or explicit probing
work.Theyarenotusefulforinvestigationsintothelimitsof adomainof ‘space’
itself, especially in the so-called ‘photo–photo matching’ games, which involve
allowing two speakers to interact directly with each other. While one describes
scenes, the other picks up the corresponding picture. In fact, spatial contrasts
amenable to comment by informants were singled out during the prepara-
tion of the photographs used for this research. From a methodological point
of view, in particular for languages that encode spatial arrays according to car-
dinal directions, as is the case in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic under particular conditions,
the indirect representation of arrays on rotatable supports (pictures) proved
quite confusing.

Do Abstract Geographical Elements Exist?
In the early stages of my research, I showed my informants not only pho-
tographs, but also drawings which I drew myself and displayed to them on
the computer screen. The relationship of my informants (almost all the illit-
erate elders) with the technological instruments of my research is remarkable.
They were generally very consistent in giving me answers in line with the real
cardinal directions according to which we and the computer screen were posi-
tioned.Forexample,if wewerelookingatcertainnon-culturallysalientobjects
shown on the screen, whose relative position was not associable to the vertical
dimension (see Figure 13), the position of the screen determined their relative
position in terms of cardinal direction, as shown in Figure 17.
This means that the computer screen itself is not seen as an autonomous,
functional, and mobile object in relation to the geographic background. It has
no intrinsic orienting properties. The screen is oriented in relation to a wider
absolute system and contiguous with it. But this contiguity can be linguistically
represented in different ways. In some of these drawings, I depicted a river and
a mountain chain and added some figures to be located in relation to these
geographic elements. The pictures were shown on the computer screen, so,
according to what I had seen previously, the expected response was either the
misunderstanding of the rules of perspective and the use of the vertical dimen-
sion to describe the relative position of the objects depicted or, as observed in
thedescriptionof large-scaleimageswithgeographicalelements,theuseof the
astronomical directions.
Since the position of the screen and, consequently, the orientation of the
picture, seemed to play a role in the image reading and the meaning attributed
to the spatial relations of the depicted arrays, I expected the orientation of my
computer screen to prime the attribution of the value to the cardinal axes. But
this changed dramatically when the objects represented on the screen were
geographical elements. I noticed that my informants abandoned the orienta-
tion of the screen as an anchoring system to skip to a different process. The
experience is reported in Figure 18, together with the positions of the partici-
pants. I was sitting beside my informant, holding the computer in front of us.
We were facing west. The computer screen was oriented along the north/south
axis, as shown in Figure 18.
Figure 18 depicts a man with a coffee pot in his own left-front region and
mountains in the background. I asked the informants, ‘Where is the coffee
pot in relation to the man?’ Following the absolute system, and in particular
according to the north/south axis along which we and the screen were placed,
the answer should have been that the coffee pot was to the east of the man.
But no, they said it was on his western side. I wondered about this abrupt

is depicted in Figure 19 (the conditions of the task orientations were the same).
In this case, we were also facing west as we looked at the screen, which was
set along the north/south axis. The image represents the flow of a wadi that,
according to the general orientation given by my speakers to the objects rep-
resented on the screen, should have been from south to north. But the content
of the image itself had little relevance. In fact, the speakers preferred to inter-
pret the flow of the wadi as proceeding from north to south. This preference
might have been due to the priming effects of the routine experience of the aṣ-
Ṣāniʿ regarding the inhabited territory, a form of adaptive memory; indeed, the

general direction of the wadi flow in the southern part of Israel runs from north
to south. In any case, this kind of answer was not inferable from the actual car-
dinal alignment in which we were positioned during the interviews. So, return-
ing to the example in Figure 18, the answer becomes plausible only in the light
of the fact that in the Negev the mountains are in the east. Thus, since in the
image the mountains are behind the man, the pot is then on his western side
because it is in front of him, i.e., opposite to the position of the mountains.
The hypothesis is then as follows: the presence of geographical elements
ascribable to a direct ‘embodied’ local and routine experience primes the selec-
tion of the locally-anchored cardinal system, based on the adaptive memory
developed by the community of the direct experience of its inhabited terri-
tories. Interestingly, in the absence of geographic elements in the images, the
astronomical system of cardinal directions is used, anchored directly onto the
computerscreenoranyotherindirectlayout.Thisbehavioralsoreflectsthefact
that many of my informants do not think of geographical elements as abstract
concepts such as ‘river,’ ‘mountain,’ ‘hill,’ or ‘desert,’ i.e., abstract labels that can
beappliedtoseriesof similarobjectsworldwide,butratherasconcreteobjects,
located in concrete locations. My informants tend to think about these ele-
ments in terms of their direct experience of them, so that ‘river’ is a certain
X-river present in their mental representations from having seen it and being
familiar with it. This means that all possibly existing ‘river’ objects may, in the
conception of my elderly informants, especially the women, have all and only
the properties of the rivers they have directly experienced, regarding, for exam-
ple, the direction of their flow. It is worth noting that this linguistic behavior
is quite diffused across languages. Therefore, Danziger and Gaskins (1993: 54)
recommend testing the possible presence of conceptual oppositions between
abstract and named objects in investigated languages.
Observing this fact from the semantic perspective of the relationship be-
tween language and cognition, we should note the existence of all the above-
reported cognitive implications of the use of schematic representations of geo-
graphicalelementsasstimuliinspatialtests,whichclearlyindicatetheconcep-
tualization of these elements inconcreteand locally-anchoredtermsalongside
the existence in the language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ of general words for ‘river,’ ‘creek,’

vation, we must admit that the relationship between language and cognition
appears to be multifaceted and multilayered and situated within complex cul-
tural architectures. Such a remarkable knowledge of the inhabited places is
undoubtedly the result of adaptation to the environment and is even more
remarkable if we consider that the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ have inhabited the Negev for less
than two hundred years.

Secondly, geographic elements, even in abstract representations, are gener-
ally assimilated into the geographic elements of the familiar landscape since
mountains and rivers in spatial semantics are processed as reference points.
Indeed,theyrepresentthestructureof alocalabsolutesystem,and,asmyinfor-
mants’ responses demonstrate, are also ‘ontologically’ associated with the axes
of the astronomic reference system.
Summarizing these observations in two points, I note the following: 1. Geo-
graphic elements are interpreted in terms of the properties of the experienced
local space despite the use of general terms for ‘mountain,’ ‘hill,’ ‘river,’ and
2. Geographic elements represent a system for spatial orientation associated
with the values of the cardinal axes. These facts are strongly suggestive of
the existence in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic of a specific ontological classification of real
objects fundamentally related to the semantic domain of space, i.e., the lin-
guistic domain of spatial orientation. Therefore, the interpretation of the geo-
graphical on an experiential basis compels us to rethink our previous general
understanding that aṣ-Ṣāniʿ speakers apply the cardinal directions of the real
situation onto an image in a picture, even if the scene in the picture has taken
place in a different context and from a different position, as happens in Guugu
Yimithirr and Tzeltal speech communities (Levinson 2003).
When the object portrayed in the picture is a familiar geographical element
whose facets and perspectives are known to my informants, they retrace the
actual cardinal orientation of the real scene depicted in the picture (Figure 16)
or attempt to connect what they see to their actual and concrete experience
of the places (Figures 18 and 19) to the extent possible. Therefore, they do not
need to apply the cardinal directions according to which the picture is oriented
infrontof theireyesatthemomentof observation,atendencyobservedamong
GuuguYimithirr andTzeltal speakers.This means that, even in the observation
and description of spatial arrays in secondary layout (pictures), in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Ara-
bic the objects are the key elements for the selection of the proper expressive
means, in this case, the anchoring frame (real or secondary) of the cardinal
coordinates.
Thus, linguistic communities that use cardinal directions as one of their
semantic framing strategies or as the prevalent framing strategy in process-
ingspatiallanguagepresentmacroscopicbehavioraldifferencesininterpreting
spatial arrays in secondary layouts (a two-dimensional medium, i.e., the pic-
ture). From the methodological perspective, this observation entailed for me
the necessity of developing more refined strategies to systematically investi-
gate the reasons for such differences.

Toward a Culture-Based Methodology
As we have seen, pictures and drawings shown on a computer screen were
somehow misleading in the investigation of the old language, since they intro-
duced many foreign elements to the traditional representation of reality in its
concrete dimension (Figures 13 and 14). A further important practical detail in
the design of stimuli for the fieldwork is the fact that many of the oldest infor-
mants have visual problems due to their advanced age, and it is unusual for
elderly women to wear glasses, since they are not supposed to read nor write.
In cultures that are far from writing practices and materials, the interpreta-
tionof schematicreproductionsorrepresentationsof realentitiesisnotalways
understandable,especiallyif theculturalrulesforschematicandsummaryrep-
resentation of the investigator are far from the schematizing criteria of the
informants. Indeed, one of my questions was why my informants could not
decipher my drawings or pictures despite the fact that they seemed to pos-
sess schematic figurative practices such as the decoration of dresses and tents
with embroidery. After a more thorough analysis, I assume that in these two-
dimensional arts more importance is probably attributed, at the traditional
symbolic level, to colors than to the portrayed objects, which are limited to
botanical and geometric motifs.
The emotional reactions of my informants—mostly women—when they
were confronted with drawings and pictures showed that such stimuli were
muchmorestress-inducingtothemthancamerasandmicrophones.Sincethey
did not feel at ease with images of unknown subjects they become disoriented,
although the questions per se were very simple. Their self-confidence in facing
the tasks decreased and, in some cases, their ability to perform the task was
compromised, as Figure 15 shows.

Representing Entities in Scale: Implications of Using Toy Objects
As soon as I comprehended the misleading effects caused by pictures in the
selection of the framing system between the coordinate system of the origi-
nal scenes and the system of the secondary layout, I understood that I could
not fully rely only on pictures or mixed data yielded by two-dimensional and
three-dimensional stimuli. Therefore, I chose to carry out my fieldwork with-
out pictures and drawings and resorted to the use of a basic set of familiar toy
objectsorrealobjectsselectedfromthetraditionallivingmilieuof theBedouin
and objects of contemporary daily use, which were also familiar to the old-
est people. Nonetheless, since the use of indirect representations of entities

in pictures had caused so much trouble, I asked myself whether my informants
wouldbeabletorecognizeinthetoyobjectsrepresentationsof realentitiesand
whether they would attribute to the toy arrays the same properties displayed
by real ones.
The question of the ontological interpretation of toy objects was raised by
Danziger and Gaskins (1993: 53), who wondered, ‘If we discover that in some
language people use an intrinsic frame for toy objects and an absolute one
for real objects, do they also approach these two kinds of objects in the same
two ways respectively when it is not a matter of talking about them but of
manipulating them?’ These authors highlight the need to test for the presence
of conceptual oppositions between real and toy objects. They approached the
issue of stimulus selection within the framework of the relationship between
language and cognition, while in my case, the question presented itself only
at the purely linguistic level. Nevertheless, Danziger and Gaskins realized that
the indirect representations of the objects can in some cases be interpreted as
objects with different properties than those of the originals.
Nevertheless, while the orientation of pictures influenced the orientation
of the arrays represented on them (Figure 13) and the presence of the effects
of perspective jeopardized the interpretation of the pictures, especially those
whose subjects were unfamiliar (Figures 12 and 14), no relevant problem was
generally detected among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ in the interpretation of toy objects
reduced in scale as the representation of real objects. Indeed, when matching
theresponsesyieldedfromtheobservationof toyobjectssuchastoytrees,peo-
ple, and animals of different kinds and the responses yielded from the observa-
tion of the same objects, but as real entities in the surrounding visible space of
the interview, I noticed that the reduction in scale did not induce any relevant
change in the spatial ontologyof thesemantic properties.In other words,while

horses, are inanimate, while the corresponding real objects are animate.

Culture-Related, Previously Acquired, and Recently Acquired
Objects
As I have just established, in the language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, I found that pictures
and drawings can only be considered as instruments for preliminary surveys,
while toy objects are valid throughout the research, as they are recognized as
representative of real entities and preserve the same ontological properties as

thoseentities.Thepreliminaryuseof picturesanddrawingsremains,neverthe-
less, an interesting part of the work, since it stimulated a series of considera-
tions regarding cultural factors that define and limit within certain reasonable
boundaries the use of the same standardized sets of stimuli in fieldwork on
differentlanguages.Indeed,picturesanddrawingsshedlightonthesetof onto-
logical properties of the objects of reality in the spatial discourse, especially
in comparison to the answers yielded in the work sessions where toy objects
or real objects were used. Dramatic differences were detected using objects
directly and indirectly, i.e., between their photographical representations and
theirrealpresence.Suchsemanticandontologicaldifferentiationsuggestedwe
should prefer three-dimensional stimuli to two-dimensional ones, and, simi-
larly, known and familiar objects to unknown, unfamiliar ones.
As Levinson claims, the techniques of linguistic fieldwork have not yet
been properly developed, and this step is not easy to execute ‘because one
needs to run artificial or natural experiments across cultures of quite differ-
ent kinds from our own, while maintaining comparability in the essentials.The
difficulties—methodological, ethical, cultural and political—are substantial,
which is one reason why such little work of this kind has been done’ (2003: 20).
A common problemis thatsomeof theimagesin thestimuliproducedso far
and available to fieldworkers are culture-dependent. For example, with respect
toBowermanandPederson’s(1992)‘TopologicalRelationsPictureSeries,’many
researchers have reported that their informants find it impossible to linguisti-
cally represent the pictures, not only because of their two-dimensional
layout—as in the case of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ—but mainly because the informants do
not know what the images represent. As Fawcett notes in her unpublished MA
thesis on Waorani spatial language:
One image is of a stamp on a letter, which for many Waorani is a com-
pletely foreign object because there is no post nearToñampari and even if
there was, there would be very few Waorani sending letters because most
of thepeopletheyknowliveintheircommunityorsurroundingones.The
image with a book sitting on a shelf that was attached to a brick wall was
also an issue for two reasons: i) books are not traditionally used in the
community (this proved to be an issue more for the older members since
the younger ones now go to school and use books) and ii) the traditional
homes of the Waorani have curved/angled walls made of leaves, which
would make having shelves essentially impossible and thus foreign. Not
to mention the fact that the shelf was against a brick wall, which could
be unrecognizable to some Waorani (perhaps those who have never left
thecommunity).Beyondthedifficultyof explainingculturallydependent

images, it was difficult to explain an image in general without priming
the speaker to use a word that they associate with the translation of what
I said. For example, when someone asked to explain a picture or clarify
what kind of response I was looking for, I had a hard time explaining the

Thesewordscouldbemine,especiallyinrelationtomyexperienceof fieldwork
inIndonesia,wherepeoplenotonlydidnotrecognizetheobjectsshownascul-
turally relevant—as the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ often did, producing very generic answers—
but had no idea about books, shelves, and bricks, objects which, however, are
now commonly used by the young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and therefore indirectly familiar to
the elderly as well.
With respect to the stimuli created for the elicitation of static angular rela-
tions, the reference tasks were based on: 1. De León’s photos of natural objects
(in Levinson et al. 1992), which encode spatial contrasts that are not obviously
lexicalizable in English, and 2. the superset of Man andTree pictures (Levinson
et al. 1992), which deals with location on the horizontal plane with both fea-
tured (man) and non-featured (tree, ball) objects. The problem with so-called
‘natural objects’ is that not every natural object is ‘natural’ in all environmental
contexts. For example, in the Sangih Islands, the informants did not recognize
the apples represented in some of the pictures, since no apples grow in their
ecosystem. Therefore, I used these pictures for inspiration in creating three-
dimensional spatial arrays consisting of toy objects set in the largest possible
number of different relative positions. The language of my oldest informants,
who represent traditional society, became increasingly precise and rich as the
stimulus objects selected became culturally and geographically recognizable,
familiar, and concrete. In contrast, the more my stimuli oriented my old infor-
mants away from the core of the traditional world, the less they were able to
articulate answers to my questions, since the stimuli were too far from the
tradition, which is expressed by a culturally codified and ritualized system of
knowledge.
The priming effects of cultural constraints and routine experiences were
particularly evident in the arrays that contained animated mobile elements.
Indeed, the spatial interpretation and linguistic description of static arrays is
often established on the basis of the supposed motional intentions of the com-
ponents of the array, the direction of their gaze, and other effects of so-called
‘fictive motion’ (Talmy 1996), such as routine movements, functions and behav-
ioral schemes attributed to an entity by default on the basis of recurrent or

daily experience.These elements prime the selection of the appropriate Frame
of Reference and preposition on the basis of the generally observed stronger
salience of motion with respect to static location (Landau 2010), making it
difficult to cognitively separate the spatial subdomain of motion from that of
location.
The distinct reactions of my informants to familiar and unfamiliar objects,
even within pictures, led me to the epistemological trail of the relevance to
space language of the semantic properties culturally related to world entities.
Sinceapreliminaryfindinghadledmetoascertainthatfamiliarandunfamiliar
stimuliyieldeddifferentresponses,Ifocusedonfamiliarelements,asbothcon-
tent and means for elicitation strategies. Therefore, on the basis of the analysis
of cross-generational cultural changes, I maintained a basic distinction already
adopted for the pictures, between:
1.
culturally related stimulus objects (tent, knife, horse, donkey, camel,
sheep, goat, dog, wild carnivores, tree, stone, fence, coffee pot, glass, fire-
place),
2.
culturally unrelated stimulus objects, further subdivided into
a.
‘acquired long ago’ (agricultural products)
b.
‘acquired recently’ (house, car, mobile telephone, computer).
To create the first category of stimuli, which I call culture-related stimulus
objects, I generally used utensils, objects, and animals that recurred in the
narrative and the anthropological reports to evaluate their degree of cultural
consistency and salience in a preliminary manner. Just as I interviewed elderly
informants on ‘unknown’ or ‘unusual’ objects characteristic of modern life, I
tested the young people on traditional objects and natural elements in order
to obtain a comparative basis. Indeed, the cross-generational difference repre-
sents a considerable cultural shift with linguistic implications. The interesting
results of this part of the enquiry—here merely hinted at—will be published in
a separate sociolinguistic study, since the main scope of the present work is the
description of angular spatial relations in the traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ vernacular,
today spoken almost exclusively by the elderly and some middle-aged mem-
bers of the community.3
According to the above-mentioned principles of stimulus categorization, as
recommended by Danziger and Gaskins (1993), I created my own superset of
stimuliandgamesdesignedtohighlightdistinctionsrelevantinaṣ-ṢāniʿArabic,
in the clearest and most exhaustive way possible. Nevertheless, I started with

because of greater exposure to the language spoken by the elderly.

the tests generally recommended to detect the most common cross-linguistic
distinctions, selecting Ground objects with and without the following distinc-
tive features: 1. animacy, 2. personhood, 3. capability of motion, 4. facedness
(without implied motion, such as shoes, chair), and 5. symmetry.
The elimination of the two-dimensional stimuli and the progressive selec-
tionof three-dimensionalones,classifiedintoculture-relatedandnon-culture-
related, have been the two principal means of refining the methodology to
ensure a culture-based approach. In relation to the creation of appropriate
stimuli, Levinson notes that ‘[i]t should be emphasized that the techniques
were developed for application in a wide cross-cultural survey of spatial lan-
guage and cognition conducted in field conditions, largely in small-scale tra-
ditional communities with unwritten languages (in Middle America, south-
ern Africa, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and elsewhere)’ (2003: 173).
I emphasize the notion that such a phase must constitute the core of the
research preliminary to the fieldwork. But afterwards, the investigation must
be elaborated according to the linguistic, cognitive, and cultural characteris-
tics of the group, even if this takes time and involves many futile attempts.
6
Practical Tools to Elicit Semantic Information
Even without a separate abstract concept of ‘space,’ all languages encode the
spatial domain in some way. In particular, as Levinson points out (2003: 64),
there is one striking universal in spatial language: as far as we know, all lan-
guages have where-questions, often with a common morpheme that bridges
motion and location (Ulltan 1978). This fact implies that all languages have at
least the notion of a delimited or determined space, i.e., all have the notion
of ‘place.’ From a methodological point of view, where-questions in the sub-
domain of static location were the main instrument of the present enquiry.
Indeed, this work presents the answers given by the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informants to
where-questions regarding the position of a certain object with respect to a
second one by means of different kinds of controlled stimuli. The aim of the
investigation was to outline the semantic treatment of the projective spatial
relations on the horizontal plane, i.e., the spatial relations between entities
whose description requires, in all languages worldwide, the use of some kind
of coordinate system. Such coordinate systems are called ‘Frames of Reference’

chapter 3
The theoretical problem of the investigation was not the presence or ab-
sence of the concept of space in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, since the interrogative adverb
wīn, ‘where?’ is used for all static spatial relationships. The main problem was
how to prime the informants toward the description of the spatial relations
between the object selected as Ground and the object selected as Figure, i.e.,
how to express the utterance ‘in relation to’ while avoiding the Standard Arabic
bi-n-nisbati ilā. In aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, the abstract meaning of spatial comparison,
like every other kind of comparison, is in fact not separate from the concrete
spatial relationship expressed by the preposition min, basically meaning ‘from.’
Thus, the question associated with the stimuli was ultimately wīn X min Y?
This kind of question was well understood in all cases. But, as a normal lin-
guistic behavior, in real-life situations, the descriptions of space only very sel-
domly use ‘min’ in the sense of ‘in relation to.’ Normally, my informants, in free
conversations and unguided stimulus descriptions, pronounced two different
sentences, one for the object taken as reference, the Ground, and one for the
object to locate, the Figure, for example: ‘there is the horse here, and the man
is behind it,’ ‘the horse is north and the man is south,’ or sentences inspired
by fictive scenarios, such as ‘the man wants to jump on the horse’ if a toy man
was seen standing close to the horse’s side. In natural spontaneous commu-
nication, speaker A very seldom asks speaker B ‘where is X in relation to Y?’
The selection of the Ground object is normally initiated by the person giving
instructions and negotiated together with the person who is asking for infor-
mation: e.g., A: Where is Y? B: Do you know X? A: Yes. B: Y is to the (left, right,
etc.) of X.
The imposition of a preliminary selection of Figure and Ground using the
structure of the question ‘where is X in relation to Y?’ is a quite an artificial
practice,butitwasnecessaryfortheaimsof thisresearch,whereawell-defined
set of spatial relations was being investigated. For example, in natural speech
situations, describing a spatial array by giving topological or angular informa-
tion is usually the personal choice of the speaker, due to a number of different
situation-based priming causes. My aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informants often noted the pos-
sibility of describing a given array in many ways, often personal, i.e., without
any relevance with respect to cultural or general linguistic rules. Nonetheless,
some of my observations are worth reporting. In the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ community, the
elders have access to a wider range of descriptive strategies than young peo-
ple do, as we will see in detail below. Looking at the spatial arrays that I was
composing as stimuli as they watched by moving two or more toy figures in a
sequence of different relative positions, mainly during the first moments of the
task, the elders wondered how they should answer, according to what we have
called ‘topological parameters’ (e.g., closeness, contact) or rather by providing

angular information (using Frames of Reference). Indeed, the initial question:
‘where is X in relation to Y?’ i.e., wīn, ‘where,’ as in most of the world languages,
canrepresentaquestionaboutpositionoraboutdistance.Themomentaryhes-
itations of the informants were due to the rich set of possibilities that could be
selected to translate into their language (a one-dimensional or linear system)
the complexity of space perception and the internal conceptual structure of
space.4
Since I had to avoid linguistic interactions with the informants as much as
possible during the tests in order not to somehow influence their understand-
ing of the stimuli, I started moving the toy Figures at the same distance but
in different positions in relation to the toy Grounds, so that my informants
automatically understood that what I was interested in was the angular infor-
mation and not their relative distance. I changed the objects of every array
of the sequence in order to avoid responses containing sequential topological
information, such as ‘X has come close to Y,’ ‘X has gone away from Y,’ ‘X has
movedtotheothersideof Y,’andsoon,andtopreventtheinformantsfromcre-
ating stories from the arrays as they followed each other in the sequences, i.e.,
to take a previous scene as a reference point for the description of the following
array, for example ‘X has come closer to Y’ or ‘X is now on the opposite side.’ I
also changed my own position often during the fieldwork sessions, repeating
the questions on the same array many times from different positions. Indeed,
I noticed that given two objects, X Figure and Y Ground, independently from
the framing system used by the speaker, the presence of additional objects or
people around the array, especially if these were intrinsically oriented, could
affect the outcome of the experiment.
During my survey of multilingual speakers in Singapore, I noted that young
Chinese speakers tended to anchor the framing system to additional objects
that were very familiar to them, like the computer, but external to the Fig-
ure/Ground doublet, as shown in Figure 20.
In Figure 20, which depicts a real situation that occurred during my field-
work in Singapore, we can see that the informant is sitting close to a table on
which there are a computer, a ball, and a pen. The array, consisting of a ball
and a pen, is on his left. Since the ball represents an unshaped Ground object,
in this case the projection of a frontal region onto the ball, within which the
speaker located the pen, took place under the effect of the orientation of the

computer.Itseemedindeedthattheorientationof thefunctionallypartitioned
and largest object could dictate the orientation of the array, as if the latter was
in a row aligned with the computer itself.
I introduced a further variation into the routine for performing the experi-
ments by setting the arrays in different positions in relation to the visual field
of the informants, so that they were initially aligned in the middle of the speak-
ers’ visual field but then also in a series of different positions. I noted that the
position of the array in relation to the informants could be of some relevance
in the selection of the semantic strategies of description, in particular vis-à-vis
the choice whether or not to consider oneself an anchoring point of the system
(investigation of the relative frame of reference—aligned field).
Not all informants, men or women, were willing for the interview to be
recorded. In compliance with their wishes and in accordance with editorial
choices, I selected for publication pictures taken from only one experimen-
tal series conducted in good lighting conditions with a young informant who
agreed to be recorded as long as her face was not shown. Needless to say, the
outcome of the experiments performed for this work is consistent across the
entire group. The selected examples represent general linguistic tendencies
recognizable among the elders of the group. Statistical calculations show that
every reported answer is representative of at least 80% of the answers elicited
within the same age group.

Methodology
In order to test the presence and distribution of frames of reference in the lan-
guage of the elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, and in particular their effects on the projection
of the front/back axis of the Ground objects, I selected several sequences of
stimuli in which different kinds of Ground objects appeared. In the following
paragraph I will present the results obtained when I selected a stone, a tree,
a flock, a donkey, a horse, a man, a sheep, and a goat as Ground objects. The
stimuli consisted of toy objects.
The choice of the Ground objects was not random. First, all these objects
are part of the speakers’ traditional cultural environment. Some of them, like
stones and trees, could easily attract the projection of external coordinate sys-
tems, being geometrically ‘symmetrical,’ i.e., showing no inherent difference
on the front/back axis or the left/right axis. Ground objects such as stones and
trees are widely considered inanimate symmetric objects and frequently used
in the literature for detecting the relative frame of reference (see ‘Man andTree
Stimuli’ in Levinson 1992, Kit 1: 7–14 and Hill 1982: 22).
Nonetheless, we know that trees are not considered symmetrical objects in
all cultures. For the Chamus, trees have an intrinsic front region that corre-
sponds to the direction of their inclination or their most prominent branch
(Heine 1989). Furthermore, on a large scale, mountains, hills, and peaks often
have an intrinsic partition, as happens, for example, in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, where a crag
on the slope of a mountain represents its nose (ḫašm al-gōz ‘the nose of the
mountain’).
To stones and trees, I added several sets of stimuli with Ground objects such
as animals of different sizes and with different functions: the horse, used for
quick transport mainly in war; the donkey, used for heavy loads and slow trans-
port; the man; and the sheep and goat, still bred for wool and, today, as food.
The flock was selected as Ground object because it represents a plural Ground
of many units. Since every one of its units can move independently, the flock
can assume different shapes and directions and become more concentrated or
more diffuse.

The Interview: ‘Where Is X in Relation to Y?’
As fully explained in the course of this chapter, the interview in which I asked
about X in relation to Y, or the preliminary interview, was the main tool for
investigating linguistic frames. Unfortunately, organizing director–matcher
games according to the protocol provided by ‘Man and Tree’ (Levinson et al.

1992)and‘BallandChair’(Bohnemeyer2008;O’MearaandPérezBáez2011)was
not possible in all cases, given the health conditions and mobility limitations
of all twenty of the older informants described in this book (it was performed
with smaller numbers of informants).
For reasons of consistency and comparability, this individual test method-
ology was also adopted in the tasks of the maa and taa generations. The
interview test was conducted on two-dimensional (pictures) supported hori-
zontally (on the table) and vertically (on a computer screen), and with three-
dimensional objects (toys). The scenes shown on the computer screen had
natural and man-made backgrounds, such as mountains and wadis, and types
of objects of different ontological classes, as explained above. Once the use of
toy objects on a horizontal support (floor, table) was established, this was cho-
sen as the protocol for the experiments reported here in chapters 5, 6, and 7,
dedicated to linguistic frames.
Linguistic tests were performed in an interactive way between interviewer
(L = Letizia) and speaker (S) or informant (I), also indicated in the images
as ‘Observer’ (I = S = O), one speaker at a time. I repeated the test question
wīn F min G? ‘where (is) F in relation to G?’ for each array I submitted to O,
imposing my selection of the Ground objects. The same Figure/Ground array
was tested three times, with Figure/Ground in different positions in relation
to each other, while I changed my position within the experimental setting to
prevent the informant from considering me an anchor. The three times were
non-consecutive, in order to prevent effects of sequential motion, such as ‘F
moved away from G.’

The Tick Test
Pilot tests revealed the existence of further interesting and culture-specific dis-
tinctions regarding the selection of simplex prepositions, compound preposi-
tionswithmin-head,andminchainsthatcouldnotberesolvedbyspontaneous
descriptions. In order to further investigate these distinctive parameters, I cre-
ated ad hoc pairs of pictures to narrow and complete the investigation that had
begun with the preliminary interviews (3.8, above). I therefore filmed video
clips and pictures to isolate and focus on distinctive parameters by means
of direct judgement questions regarding minimal pairs of sentences, i.e., sen-
tences that differed only in terms of the semantic parameter I was testing.
These new stimuli were called tick tests. Tick tests were designed ad hoc to
solve uncertain cases. The stimuli capture the complex interplay of quantita-
tive and qualitative features of the entities with several axial properties (func-
tional alignment, distance, affordance, alignment with the Observer).

Tick Test: taa giddām vs. min giddām/fg Interactional Distance/1
In Scene B, fg were not more distant from the Observer or smaller, only more distant from
each other.
The informant listened through headphones to short taa stimulus sen-
tences spoken by a native speaker. After each stimulus sentence, a pair of adja-
cent pictures appeared on the computer screen, and the task was to indicate
(by pointing) the one that corresponded to the spoken sentence.
Figure 21 reports an example, with the scene pairs A and B differentiated by
the parameter of Figure/Ground interactional distance. The possible answers
are reduced to a binary option.This pair of pictures remained on the screen for
five seconds, and after an interval of five additional seconds, the next stimu-
lus appeared. After at least three additional test sets, intended to prevent any
influenceof thefirstanswer,thesamestimulusappearedagain,incombination
with its ‘minimal pair’ sentence.
The experiment was thus carried out in two phases, 1 and 2. In Phase 1 the
informant listened to this sentence: aš-šağarah min giddām az-zalamih, ‘the
tree is in front of the man’ with the compound preposition min giddām (lit.
‘from in front’). Scenes A and B seen above were placed in front of him, prop-
erly distinguished. The informant pointed at the fitting image, as if making a
tick mark. In Phase 2, after three different pairs were tested, the same pair of
scenes A and B was tested again. The complementary sentence aš-šağarah gid-
dām az-zalamih, ‘the tree is in front of the man’ was thus tested without min.
The same scene pair was set in front of him/her:

RqṢ_F1930?Lig/2006?
The elderly Niʿmih, an aṣ-Ṣāniʿ matriarch, aunt of Maryam and Rgīyih, whom
I had the chance to interview shortly before she passed away in 2014, remem-
bered with emotion and nostalgia the days of the great travels to the Egyptian
desert, the visits to family members in Jordan, and the huge, luxurious, market
of Gaza, where all sorts of goods were traded. The days of her youth seemed
to have been full of adventures. Like many other women, she could ride horses
and shoot a rifle to defend herself and the herds, as in small groups women
often left the tents to lead camels and flocks to wide pastures far away from the
encampment. Niʿmih, as I remember her, was not as modest as today’s Bedouin
women; despite her advanced age, every day she put black koḥl around her eyes
and chose with care traditionally embroidered clothes and jewelry, including
a nose ring, which she only wore after her marriage, since wearing gold before
marriage was considered shameful. She never takes it out; if she does, she says,
she gets a headache. The koḥl was once make with burnt hen feathers mixed
with olive oil. Niʿmih always had her hair well colored with ḥinnah. Once, she
said, women had a white veil and a black dress, the ṯōb, and hands and feet
were always colored with ḥinnah. Now, she says, women have a lot of free time
to embroider their clothes, as they no longer graze the flocks, grind the grain,
make cheese and butter, or weave carpets for the tent and saddle blankets.
Niʿmih has had a tattoo on her cheek since she was young. I asked if the tattoo
had any meaning. She said that no, it was only decorative. Gypsy women from
Egypt tattooed the girls. Her daughter-in-law, Fāṭmih, tenderly jokes about her
coquetry. Smoking a small cigar, Niʿmih once showed me the pictures of the

most beautiful horses her family had once possessed, hanging on the walls of
the room where she used to sleep, in the house of her firstborn son. She also
told me that her children were usually born near the well, due to the effort of
carrying the water. She said she had been an obedient wife and a good mother.
Nonetheless, after the fifteenth child, her husband, who according to the tribal
rules was also her cousin on her father’s side, left her for a younger woman.
They had never met before they were married at sixteen. Niʿmih felt fiercely
offended, stopped hosting her husband in her tent, started smoking, and put a
venomous snake in the new wife’s bed.
All of this took place in the nineteen sixties. At that time, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ were
still settled in the mixed transit camp of Tel ʿArād, set up by the State of
Israel on the lands that once belonged to the Ğahāllīn tribe, which fled north-
east to what is now the Palestinian Authority. Niʿmih told me that life there
was extremely hard, especially because the water pool was very far from the
shelters. Finally, at the beginning of the nineteen seventies, the Israeli gov-
ernment allowed the Bedouins to return to live in the Negev in seven ‘recog-
nized villages’ around Beer-Sheva, with zoning plans and state infrastructure.
The small, yet prestigious, aṣ-Ṣāniʿ tribe still retained rights on portions of
their original lands northeast of Beer-Sheva. Thus, they returned to a mean-
ingful area that included an old cemetery and an ancient water pool to build
their settlement. Recently, the old water pool has been restored. Here the aṣ-
Ṣāniʿ granted permission to members of allied tribes, vassals, and affiliated
groups to build their houses. Ligīyih, from the root l.q.y., means ‘the meeting
(place).’
The following paragraphs report some firsthand information collected from
my aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informants on their traditional perception, subdivision, and use
of space, with particular reference to the tent, the village, and the local Negev
landscape, and of time, subdivided into daytime and nighttime and connected
with the seasons and seasonal activities (Bailey and Danin 1981).

The Tent
In traditional Bedouin societies, the house, the tent, called bītaš-šaʿr, lit. ‘house
of hair’ or ḫaymih, is a microcosm that intimately reflects the Bedouin world
and the ritual intertwining of its spaces and times (Cardona 1985).
Even in the pre-spherical view of the universe found in the Bible, the world
is compared to a home for mankind, which in the ancient Hebrew culture was
also seen as a tent:

ily and the number of internal sectors related to the presence of more women
and their children. The word migdim is used in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ not only to express the
first and higher part of the tent, but also with the meaning of ‘the first and
lower part’ of an object such as a cave or a slope, meaning its first accessible
portion. The word migdim derives from the root g.d.m., from which the prepo-
sition gu/iddām ‘in front of’ and the word gidm ‘foot’ also derive.
The side of the tent exposed to the sun is called mišragah in the Syrian
Bedouin dialect of the Jazirah studied by Bettini (2006: 275), from the root
š.r.g., the same root as šarg ‘east,’ recalling the ancestral, fixed eastern orienta-
tion of the tent’s opening. According to Habakuk (1986: 77–87), Bedouin tents
in general open eastwards across the Sinai Peninsula, Iraq, Syria, and Jordan,
with some exceptions in the Arabian desert and in some places in Sinai and in
the hills south of Hebron, where the wind conditions are slightly different, so
the tents may open to the east-southeast. This does not represent a dramatic
change, because southeast and even south are culturally encompassed within
the eastern direction: the southern quadrant derives from the ancestral ‘east-
ern’ sector that encompassed east and south, and retains some of its positive
values (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2016).3
In the Arabian desert, the western back flap is always kept closed as it faces
strong, unpleasant winds (Musil 1928: 73). But the scarce familiarity with the
back part of the tent also derives from religious and superstitious beliefs. The
western part of the tent was considered ominous: the back curtains near the

axis represents the basic polar opposition from which the north/south axis has developed via
the progressive distinction of north from west and of south from east. During my fieldwork
sessions among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, accompanied by Dr. ʿAbdelraḥmān, who was around sixty years
old, I realized that he sometimes translated ġarb as ‘north.’

This historic link can be traced back to ancient Egypt, where burial customs
required the corpse to face west, since this is where the dead go. In the Negev,
funeral processions proceed min taḥt ḏīl ar-rwāg ‘under the back flap,’ i.e., to
the west. The western back flap of the tent is kept closed for this reason (Bar-
Zvi et al. 1998: 41). Moreover, in the Levant the association of the west with the
sea gave rise to pagan Canaanite traditions of sea worship at funerals that con-
tinued into the twentieth century, as the sea is conceptualized as gathering the
souls of the dead (Bar-Zvi et al. 1998: 21–23).
Until now, in the Negev, the tents face east and access to them is permitted
only from the front, eastern side. As for the modern houses, as I could observe,
they do not all face east, as the position of the entrance is often dictated by
the location of the existing access street.4 Thus, the absolute anchoring of the
house is lost, yet entrance from the back side, which once corresponding to the
west, is still considered ominous.

‘The entrance is from the front side, only from the front side, there is no

somebody builds a house and makes a (wedding) party for his children, it

from the back side, it is allowed to enter only from the front door. And
it is forbidden among us that the man enters from the women’s side, the

In the unrecognized villages, the zinc huts called ṣirfān, sing. ṣrīf, are still ori-

Bedouin people for picnics and outings, scattered on the sandy hills around

the east/west axial partition is retained in what many still consider the ideal

house, often engineers and architects are requested to place the main entrance
on the eastern side of the house and proceed from east to west in a series on
spaces from the guest room to the bedrooms, to the kitchen and toilets on the
extreme western side.5 It is interesting how this new Bedouin ‘feng shui’ con-
finestherestroomsandthekitchen,wherewaterisusedandwasteisproduced,
to the western side of the house. Humidity and death are both symbolically
associated with the idea of dangerous contamination, and therefore must be
kept separate from the pure dryness of the living space, which embodies the
desert landscape. In Sinai Bedouin proverbs, the ‘stranger,’ by means of antono-
masia, is the dead, called ġarīb ‘western, foreigner’:
al-ġarīb mūhu ġarīb aš-šām al-yamāni
al-ġarīb ġarīb al-laḥad w al-kafāni
‘A person isn’t gone when he’s in Shām or the Yemen;
A person’s gone in the grave and the shroud.’

During several fieldwork sessions in Malaysia and Indonesia, between the
Sangih Islands, Singapore, Bali, Makassar, the Torajaw land, and the North
Sulawesi,6 I noticed that the orientation of the houses follows the same spatial
partition, with the western direction generally associated with kitchens and
bathrooms, the humid and/or contaminated area of the house. Surely, in the
Indonesian environment, extremely different from the Negev, the west is not
necessarily the direction of the cold and humid winds, rains, and humidity
throughout the Malaysian and Indonesian archipelagos. So, perhaps it is the
western direction of the sun setting that attracts associations of death. Accord-
ing to Brown (2003), this is a universal pattern, regardeless of local landscape
and climate conditions. It is also impossible to ignore the possibility that the
contact with Muslim culture has reinforced the ritual symbolic practices con-
nected to the directions in southeast Asia, which nevertheless seem linked to
the cultures of indigenous societies, whose spatial, linguistic, and cognitive
representations are based on cardinal directions (Ozanne-Rivièrre 1972; Wass-
mann and Dasen 1998).
From the perspective of the climate of the Middle East, certainly the open-
ing towards the east has functional benefits, since the west/northwest sides are

the most exposed to the elements, especially cold and damp winds, carriers of
rain. The east/west axial orientation is not only anchored in the the sun’s daily
course, but also brings with it summery ventilation; the cool eastern breeze
(šargīyih) blows in the morning, while in the evening the cool western wind
(ġarbīyih) comes from sea (Habakuk 1986). It is no coincidence, I assume, that
the central back pole of the Bedouin tent is called zāfrih in the Negev.The word
is evidently related to the Greek term zéphyros, probably etymologically con-
nected with zóphos ‘darkness, west,’ which indicated the strong western wind,
full of humidity and rain.7
Furthermore, in the organization of their social space, the Negev Bedouin
symbolically and concretely ‘looked toward the east’ as the horizon of all pos-
sible social interactions, both positive and aggressive, as the east is felt to be
the ancestral, ideal homeland of all Bedouins, no matter in which actual direc-
tion they are found. It is not by chance that in the Bedouin narrative, the
default direction in which the hero leaves at the beginning of every adven-
ture is the east: ḥaṭṭib-wujho haš-šarg u-šarrag ‘He put in his face the east
and went east’ (Rosenhouse 1984: 206). Indeed, beside the term ʿarab ‘nomads,’
another Bedouin endonym is ahal aš-šarg ‘the people of the east’ (Alʿatāmīn
2011/1: 17).8 In this respect, it is interesting how the raiding parties, especially
the Ḥwēṭāt, who were actually spread over northern Arabia, Jordan (Shawār-
bah 2012), and northern Sinai (Marx 1967), are generally described in Negev
Bedouin poetry as arriving from the east (Habakuk 1986).9 Alʿatāmīn (2011/2:
20) reports the account of an interaction with some Ḥwēṭāt who had arrived
at a Negev encampment. Two people were sent back with them in a sort of
7 Zephyr’s use as a term to refer to a light spring breeze, widespread in Italian Renaissance and
European Neoclassical poetry and art, is a secondary literary and iconographic development,
derived from the original meaning of stormy wind through the conceptual bridge of its fruc-
tifying and regenerating strength manifested in the spring.
8 Across Bedouin cultures, east represents the origin and the home of original Bedouin life,
where positive ethical and esthetic values are manifested as opposite to those to the west,
the land of non-Bedouin, sedentary peoples who practiced agriculture. In Musil’s work on
Rwala Bedouins, he reports that nuġarreb ‘we go west’ is used when the Rwala wander from
the inner desert into a settled country, no matter in what direction (Musil 1928: 167). The
opposite eastern path is seen as the way home to the inner desert, no matter in what direc-
tion: ‘If they come to the inner desert (šarraḳaw), I am cheerful of mind. But should they go
to the settled country (ġarrabaw), then, oh woe is me’ (Musil 1928: 210); ‘The camels do not
like the pasture in the settled territory; they yearn for the inner desert (tašārīž)’ (Musil 1928:
225–227).
9 The direction of the tents toward the east was not related to the need to protect them from
aggressions carried out by eastern enemies, as in the Bedouin war codes it is forbidden to
attack actual households (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2016).

relations between the Negev and Transjordanian tribes are extensively docu-

Undoubtedly, among the Negev Bedouin, the domestic space remains sym-
bolically organized according to an absolute partition, based on cardinal direc-
tions, over the generations. Nonetheless, the traditional tent also has an inher-
ent partition. As it is made of camel or goat hair and goat skins, it is metaphor-
ically associated with an animal, standing on its four hooves, with its snout
(that is actually a human face) and its rear part, as Hāğir, ʿAbdelkarīm’s wife,
explained, pointing to a model of a Bedouin tent that he keeps in the kitchen
above the tv, opened toward the east, as a souvenir of the past:

The last part of the explanation given by Hāğir and ʿAbdelkarīm was of par-

axial orientation was always fixed. This fact demonstrates the secondary and
lesser significance of the north/south axis. The important thing was to keep
men and women separated so that men could host guests without compromis-
ing women’s privacy. As Maryam said:

Hāğir’s Toy Model of the Bedouin Tent, Used to Explain the Tent’s Partition
According to some Negev Bedouin sources, the owners of the tent usually
sat south of the central fireplace, between the guests’ šigg, literally ‘side,’16 to
the north and the women to the south, so the women were behind the tent’s
owner, who protected them, while letting them see and somehow interact with
the guests from a respectful distance. Nevertheless, according to my personal
observations, even among the southern ʿAzāzmih, the north/south partition of
the tent could be reversed (Alʿatāmīn 2011).
Among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ the šigg is usually on the southern side of the village.
ʿAbdelkarīm added that the common šigg, the men’s tent erected in each vil-
lage, with representative and political functions, was often placed toward the
southern side of the encampment, projecting the tent’s microcosmic partition
onto the larger scale of the settlement in a sort of cultural spatial hologram.
When Hāğir described the tent’s internal partition, she declared that the
‘right’ part (yamīn) was the men’s part, which makes absolute sense, since as
the tent faces east, its intrinsic right sector is the southern one. Yet, interest-
ingly, she pointed to the actual northern side of the toy tent, and her husband
told her: ‘This is the north.’ Indeed, the toy tent was placed with the opening
to the west, in front of me, so that I could see and follow their explanations. If
the opening is to the west, the right side is the northern one. Hāğir pointed to
the right side, assuming by default that the tent’s entrance coincided with the
eastern direction and, therefore, its right sector with the south. So, whenever
Hāğir thinks about a tent, it would always be opened toward the east. These
16
Šigg, like its etymological cognate šaggah, means ‘part’ (Shawārbah 2012: 431), ‘side,’ or
‘embankment’ in the geomorphic sense.

The Default Eastern Orientation
of the Tent
kinds of small, fortuitous observations opened my eyes to the role of culture,
routine scenes, and interactions between entities in the study of linguistic and
cognitive representations.
Hāğir was not the only informant to process the tent entrance as facing east
by default, no matter what the actual direction was during the experiment or
the conversation. For example, I was once showing a picture of a man stand-
ing in front of a Bedouin tent on the computer screen. The screen was turned
toward the west, while the informant, Ḫalīl aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, and I were facing toward
the east, as shown in Figure 24.
I asked Ḫalīl where the man in the picture was standing in relation to the
tent. He looked and said, az-zalamih wara al-bīt, ‘The man is standing behind
the tent.’ I asked Ḫalīl if he was sure about his answer, so he pointed to a
spot just in front of us, beyond the computer screen, and said: aš-šarg hū ġād,
az-zalamih wāgif wara al-bīt, ġarb, min al-bīt w-ğāy ‘The east is over there, so
the man is standing behind the tent, west, in our direction in relation to the
tent.’
While Hāğir calculated the orientation of the toy tent assuming that its
entrance was always associable with the eastern direction, Ḫalīl ignored the
direction of the tent’s entrance in the drawing, orienting the scene according
to the actual cardinal directions of the experimental setting. Over the many
months of my fieldwork, I would discover that the type of stimulus, three-
dimensional toy or two-dimensional image, deeply affected my informants’
responses, as I show below.
Inanycase,thefrontregionof thetentisalwaysorientedtotheeast,whileits
rear part is oriented to the west, so when the tent is used as object in relation
to which other entities are located ‘in front of the tent’ and ‘east of the tent’
are synonymous, as are ‘behind the tent’ and ‘west of the tent.’ Thus, Niʿmih

The fixed eastward orientation of the tent’s entrance makes the tent a hybrid
object in which inherent partition and absolute or cardinal orientation collide.
The coexistence of different spatial systems maintains ancient Middle Eastern
conceptual patterns.17 A situation similar to that of the tent is observed in local
salient landmarks. With its fixed orientation, the tent is also a system for keep-
ing a record of the hours of the day, as we will see below.
The almost one-hundred-year-old Niʿmih, sister of šēḫḥāğğ Ibrāhīm, daugh-
ter of ʿAbdelkarīm, and first wife of ʿAlī aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, remembered the winter nights
in the desert, when a curtain of vapor rose over the tents because of the con-
trast between the heat emanating from the fire inside and the cold night air
outside. ‘Modern houses are damp,’ she used to say. She had also kept the oil

the cosmological or solar, with reference to celestial bodies, especially the sun; and (3) the
topographic economic, with reference to geographical measurements or local landmarks.

NʿṢ_F1920_Lig/March2013
I asked Niʿmih why she did not ask her family to build a tent for her. She replied
seriously that it takes a large flock to keep a tent in good shape, as weathered
leather or woolen parts need to be replaced every year. The tent, the flock, and
nomadism are elements of the same balance so closely interconnected that it
is now impossible to go back in time.

Humans and Animals in the Domain of Space
The functional and symbolic correlation between macrocosm and microcosm
within the space of the tent echoes some passages of Bedouin didactic poetry
from the Arabian Peninsula, in which the rider is exhorted to align different
parts of the body of the mount, horse or camel, towards celestial bodies and
stars to instruct it regarding the directions of the night marches.
While the tent has an intrinsic partition, with particular salience of the
front/back axis, and is always oriented according to the cardinal directions,
body parts of riding animals, like those of humans, can be oriented according
to absolute reference points. Among the Rwala (in southern Jordan), the body
of the camel was used as a means to orient one’s own direction according to

the stars, the same as the body of the traveler: ofṭon al-ğedi ‘mind the North
Star’ and ‘lay the North Star on the face of thine animal’ mean take a northerly
course; ‘Lay it on thy left brow’ means take a north–northeast course; ‘Lay it
on thy left shoulder’ means go northeast; ‘Lay it on thy saddleback from the
left’ means go eastwards; ‘Lay it on the back saddle knob’ means go south, and
so on (Musil 1928: 355). These passages from Musil’s anthology of the Rwala
customs are extremely interesting, also because they show spatial descriptions
quite similar to those in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and other Negev Arabic varieties that I discuss
in this book.
The use of absolute strategies, cardinal directions, celestial bodies, and
salient landmarks seems to characterize all Bedouin linguistic communities,
as they probably stretch back to a common, pan-Bedouin background, before
the dispersion of the Arab tribes from their ancestral core area in the Arabian
Peninsula.
In addition to the aforementioned absolute descriptors, the front/back axis
and the lateral axis are also distinguished across Bedouin linguistic communi-
ties, to different extents, via pairs of opposite prepositions meaning ‘in front’
and ‘behind’ and ‘right’ and ‘left.’
4
Right and Left
As I show in the experimental part of this work, traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic
only distinguishes ‘in front of’ (giddām)20 and ‘behind’ (wara),21 while the
terms ‘right’ (yimīnī) and ‘left’ (šimālī) only refer to human hands, yet they are
not grammaticalized into spatial regions and projective prepositions (cardinal
directions can be used instead). As mentioned in chapter 2, ‘right’ and ‘left’ are
usedonlytodistinguishhumanhands,whileothersymmetricpartsof thebody
are not frequently distinguished by ‘right’ and ‘left.’ Thus, within the space of
the tent, which provides an astronomically oriented field, memories of body
parts may have an absolute anchoring, as in this example:

The right hand (al-īd al-yimīnih) and the left hand (al-īd aš-šimālih) are distin-
guished by these two different terms. Interestingly, the lexical root of yimīnih
‘right (hand),’ y.m.n., is also associated with the southern direction, al-Yamān,
which is the southern boundary of the Arab world, while šimālih ‘left (hand)’
derivesfromš.m.l.,thesamerootasšimāl ‘north.’Whenanindividualfaceseast,
his right side is turned toward the south and his left side toward the north. As
Comrie (2003: 52) aptly puts it, ‘Occasionally […] a particular term belongs to
more than one frame of reference. A nice example of this is provided by Brown
(1983)’s study of the origin of cardinal direction terms, in which he shows for a
wide range of languages that, where etymologies are available, the terms for
cardinal directions usually reflect reinterpretations of other frames of refer-
ence.’ Comrie’s study is centered on the conflation of right/left with east/west
in a number of English varieties. Brown (1983) considers the eastern direc-
tion universally the main and primary one, as it is associated with the rising
of the sun, around which the rest of the compass is organized. Notably, both
yamān and ša/imāl (pattern faʿāl) morphologically represent concrete place
names,22 while šarg and ġarb (pattern faʿl) are verbal nouns of action that
define the rising and the setting of the sun. This is a further indication of the
primacy and of the astronomically anchored east/west axis, from which the
secondary north/south axis, anchored on landmarks, was derived (Cerqueglini
and Henkin 2016).23
In Biblical Hebrew, for example, the eastern direction is qedem (Exodus 27:
13),relatedtotherootq.d.m.,the‘front’direction,thedirectionparexcellence.24
22
Šimāl is also replaced by šām ‘north’ and ‘Damascus’ (Behnstedt et al. 2011), from which
the common denomination bilād aš-Šām ‘the northern country,’ indicating the northern
part of the Arab world, i.e., the Levant (Syria, Lebanon, Palestine) derives.
23
Because of the diachronic adaptation and synchronic coexistence of the original nomadic
cardinal system alongside various sedentary local landscapes conquered during the Is-
lamic expansion, lexical sources for the cardinal directions undergo a complex transfor-
mative process labeled ‘polyframing’ in Cerqueglini and Henkin (2016).
24
In Modern Hebrew, the word for ‘east’ is mizraḥ(Even-Shoshan 1979: 1283), whose origi-
nal meaning is the locative noun ‘place of the sunrise,’ which parallels Arabic mašriq. In
Biblical Hebrew, both qedem and mizrāḥappear for ‘east,’ often together, as in ‘To the east

West is called yam ‘sea,’ anchored on the position of the Mediterranean Sea in
relation to the Levant (Numbers 34: 6),25 the south is negev, the arid region in
the south of Israel (Genesis 24: 62),26 and the north is ṣafōn, from the name of
towards the sunrise’ (Joshua 19: 12); ‘On the east side towards the sunrise’ (Numbers 2:
3). The word moṣāʾ is less common. It means ‘place of origin,’ i.e., where the sun comes
up. It is used in Psalm 75: 6. In biblical Hebrew and Aramaic, qdm mans ‘east,’ ‘in front,’
and ‘antiquity,’ with qdmwn and qdm(w)ny for ‘eastern’ (Fohrer et al. 1973: 242). In Qum-
ran Aramaic, the word for east is qdym (Cook 2015: 204), while qdmt means ‘eastward’
(and temporal ‘before,’ Cook 2015: 206), and qdm/qwdm spatial ‘before’ (Cook 2015: 205).
Stadel(2008)hypothesizesthattheQumranAramaictermforthecardinaldirectionqdym
is a Hebraism. In the Dictionary of Talmud, Targumin and Midrashim, the root z.r.ḥ. in
hifʿil form is found for ‘to go east’ (Jastrow 1903: 413). The Syriac word for ‘east’ is madnḥo
(Jennings 1926: 116), with the attribute madenḥoyo ‘eastern’ and the form madnaḥ‘east-
ward,’ the place of the sunrise (Payne Smith 1903: 253), from the root d.n.ḫ., ‘shine,’ from
whichdenḥo‘therising,shiningof sunorstars,sunrise,dayspring,brightness,light’(Payne
Smith1903:95)derives.ThewordmadnḥoappearsfrequentlyintheSyriacNewTestament
(Matthew 24: 27; 2: 1; 8: 11; Luke 13: 29) and in prepositional compounds, such as b-madnḥo
(Matthew2:9;2:2).Inthelexiconof theNeo-AramaicvarietiesdescribedbySabar(North-
western Kurdistan), the words for ‘east’ are mušruq, mizraḥ, and zrāqa (2020: 36).
25
‘The Arameans on the east and the Philistines on the west’ (Isaiah 9: 12) actually says
qedem and ʾāḥōr, which could also be translated as ‘the Arameans in front of you and the
Philistines behind you.’ The Mediterranean is also called ʾaḥarōn ‘the sea that is behind’
(Deuteronomy 11: 24; 34: 2). Numbers 34: 6 says ‘As for the western border, you shall have
the Great Sea.’ The original here says ‘As for the yam border, you shall have the Great Yam.’
The Modern Hebrew word for ‘west,’ maʿarav (Even-Shoshan 1979: 1147) was originally the
locative word for the setting place of the sun, parallel of Arabic maġrib. In Qumran Ara-
maic, mʿrbʾ is westward (Cook 2015: 172). The Syriac word for ‘west’ is ʿrobo (Payne Smith
1903: 427) and maʿrbo (Matthew 8: 11; Luke 13: 29; 12: 54) is also present in the prepositional
compounds l-maʿrbo (Matthew 24: 27) and b-maʿrboy (Mark 1: 32).The word ʿrubto, Friday,
is connected with the word for sunset/evening, as it originally indicates the eve of the Sab-
bath (I thank Prof. Mutzafi for this suggestion). The Neo-Aramaic varieties described by
Sabar (2020: 127) have muġrub, maʿarav, and ġarbī for west.The Syriac words for ‘northern
wind’ and ‘north’ are garbay/garbyo and the adjective ‘northern’ garbyoyo (Payne-Smith
1903: 77), not etymologically connected to the root ġ.r.b. and rather probably derived from
some toponym.
26
The origin of the Modern Hebrew word for ‘south’ is darom, also used in the Bible (dārōm)
is unclear. Another biblical word for ‘south’ is tēmān, as in Deutronomy 3: 27, derived from
y.m.n., associated with ‘right side,’ based on the default position of facing the east. In Mod-
ern Hebrew, Teman is the name of Yemen. In the Bible, ‘south’ is also associated to the
position of the Negev desert. All three words for ‘south’ are used in one single verse in
Ezekiel: ‘Son of man, set your face towards Teman, and speak out against the Darom and
prophecy against the forest land of the Negev’ (Ezekiel 20: 46). In the verse ‘The north
and the south, you have created them’ (Psalm 89: 12), the Hebrew has yāmīn and ṣāfōn,
‘right side and north.’ A clear indication that yāmīn is here used as ‘south.’ In the Dictio-
nary of Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic (Fohrer et al. 1973: 60, 108, 300) drwm, ymny, and
tymn are all words for ‘south’ and ‘southern wind.’ In Qumran Aramaic, drwm is the word

the Syrian Mount Ṣafōn, toward the north.27 Thus, in Biblical Hebrew, ‘east’ is
expressed by the name of an abstract direction, while the other three cardinal
directions are actual places, i.e., they are based on local landmarks as seen from
the southern Levant.
The right hand has a cultural and social relevance in the honor code of the
Bedouin tribal law, as it is used in making promises and oaths, and to take
revenge, as in the following poem:
(…) al-yimīn yirmīh u ʾana bi kull māli ʾafnīh
ya nğīb aṯ-ṯār u niḏbaḥʾaʿādīna
ya nmūt u nḏ̣all ʿa-bakrat ʾabīna

‘My right hand will bring him low and I’ll annihilate him with all my
means.
Either we attain our vengeance and destroy our foes,
Or we die becoming like all the rest,
Relinquishing vengeance to the Creator of night and day.’

for ‘south’ (Cook 2015: 58), and is considered by Stadel (2008) a Hebraism. In the Gene-
sis Apocryphon from Cave 1, an etymology of this word is proposed: ‘they call the south
drwm because there the great one dwells (daʾar)’ (1QapGen 21: 9; Abegg and Wise 2005).
Another Qumranic Aramaic word for south is ymyn, morphologically an attribute. The
word means primarily ‘right (side),’ as the south is basically the right side when one looks
eastward (Cook 2015: 103). The Syriac word for south is taymno (Luke 13: 29; 12: 55), also in
conjunction with relational and prepositional prefixes, in d-taymno (Mathew 12: 42; Luke
11: 31; Acts 28: 13, 27: 13) and l-taymno (Acts 27: 12, 8: 26).
27
‘Left’ is also used in the sense of ‘north’ in Genesis (14: 15): ‘He pursued them as far as
Hobah which is śmōl of Damascus’, and in Joshua (19: 27) ‘… and to the valley of Iphtael
northward (ṣāfōna) … then it proceeded on north (śmōl) to Cabul.’

Musil (1928: 102) reports that among the Rwala, the ceremony follows many
steps in which the right and left hands are assigned separate functions:
Then he again pours a little coffee in the cup, shakes it round to see its
color, takes a sip, smacks his lips, and savors the coffee to find out how it
tastes. Having gulped it down, he takes in his left hand from four to six
cups, inserting one in to the other, seizes the handle of the pot with his
right hand, and from above pours in to the cups a stream of coffee as del-
icate as a spider’s thread. As soon as the bottom of the cup is covered, he
hands it to the foremost guest. The latter takes it in his right hand, licks it,
smacks his lips, and slowly drinks; it is not becoming to drink all of one’s
coffee at one gulp. Meanwhile the slave pours out for the rest. When the
first guest has finished drinking, the slave pours out for him again, jedîr
ʿa-r-reğâl. The fourth helping the guest must decline with the word ḥâğe,
even though he would like to drink more. After an interval, however, he
may resume drinking.
Alʿatāmīn provides an account of the ritual coffee service in the Negev, where
the right side is mentioned repeatedly as the starting side:

All riding animals (horse, donkey, camel), whose bodies are probably spatially
partitioned by continuity with the body of the rider, are included in the set that
primes the use of giddām and wara. Indeed, once the rider is on the mount, the
front/back(andtheright/left)of theanimalcoincidewiththerider’saxes.Dogs
are usually seen beside people, so human axes can also be easily transferred to
the animal. Probably due to the routine, culturally embedded riding scene, rid-
ing animals and dogs have acquired an intrinsic partition or armature similar
to that attributed to human bodies, via their culturally codified contiguity with
human bodies in typical scenes. The culturally salient, repetitive scenes that
are part of daily life have proved to have a fundamental role in the linguistic
coding of spatial relations in the traditional Bedouin world, as I demonstrate
below.
Attributed only to objects considered asymmetrical along the front/back
spatial axis, the front and back regions are described in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
Arabic by means of different prepositions of more or less concrete and bodily
origin and prepositional compounds, including giddām, min giddām, ʿa wiğh,
and gabl, all translated as ‘in front of,’ while wara and min wara are translated
as ‘behind.’ Their actual uses entail different semantic distinctions. The dis-
tinctions that separate simplex giddām from the prepositional compound min
giddām and simplex wara from the prepositional compound min wara are pro-
vided in separate sections in chapter 5. In the present paragraph, I provide
some etymological materials concerning the words grammaticalized as rep-
resentations of the front and back regions in space and their temporal uses.
In accordance with the cross-linguistic observations on the source domain
of grammaticalization of spatial prepositions (Heine 2010), in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ spatial
and temporal prepositions are also largely based on human and animal body

parts. Furthermore, aṣ-Ṣāniʿ prepositions originate from both nouns and nom-
inal and verbal roots.
5.1
Spatial Anteriority across Generations: The Front Region
What can be said with some certainty is that giddām, gabl, and ʿa wiğh, all
translated into the English ‘in front of,’ and often used today as synonyms, do
not describe exactly the same spatial relations, at least in the elderly people’s
variety. Starting from giddām, its root g.d.m., probably etymologically associa-
ble with qadm ‘human foot, from the ankle downward’ (Lane 1968: 2985),28 is
not lexicalized in the word for ‘foot’ in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, where riğl is used instead. The
closest evidence of the root g.d.m. yielding the body part term gidam for ‘foot,
foreleg’ is in Najd (Kurpershoek 1994: 441). In fact, the root q.d.m. ‘to go before’
is widely present throughout Semitic, but terms meaning ‘foot’ from this root,
also rare in Arabic, are not reconstructed for Semitic.29
Across the Negev and Sinai, the root g.d.m. produces a number of verbs
related to the idea of ‘front,’ such as gaddam ‘to push forward’30 or ‘to put
in front’ (Alʿatāmīn 2011/1: 5). Giddām is also used as an adverb, as in wid-
dna nʿazzib giddǣm ‘we want to go to pasture forward’ (Henkin 2010: 256).
The adverbial use is also found in other Bedouin dialects, e.g., Rwala tāḥod
ʿan al-ğejš židdām ‘keep ahead of other riders’ (Musil 1928: 367). While adver-
bial giddām does not require the min prepositional head, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ adverbial
wara must be accompanied by a prepositional head such as min ‘from’ or li- ‘to,
toward.’31 Gabl is etymologically related to the giblih, the direction of the prayer
toward Mecca, the giblī, the southern wind, and gibal ‘fore part’ (Kurpershoek
1994: 441). ʿa wiğh literally means ‘on face’ (ʿala wiğh), from the relative human
body part. This prepositional compound is not used in combination with all
objects but only with those to which an inherent ‘face’ is culturally attributed,
28
The use of the lower part of the human body for the description of the front region is
quite rare cross-linguistically, less frequent than upper body parts such as forhead, eyes,
face, mouth, chest. The lower part of the body is rather used to represent relations of type
‘down.’ In the case of plants lower parts, ‘root’ in Neo Mandaic is associated with the topo-
logical relation of type ‘inside’ (Mutzafi 2014: 212).
29
Terms for leg/foot derived from q.d.m. are absent from Militarev and Kogan’s Etymological
Dictionaryof SemiticAnatomicalTerms (2000). I thank the anonymous reader of this book
who suggested this observation.

each other’ (? min gabāla), min ḳabl ‘already’ (Nishio 1992: 188), min ḳabl ‘at first’ (Musil
1928: 630), and min giddām ‘head on’ (aṣ-Ṣāniʿ).

such as the human body, mount animals used for transport, carnivores, birds
of prey, and, as shown above, wiğh can be used to indicate the front part of the
tent. ʿa wiğh is also used to indicate ‘on top of,’ ‘on the surface of,’ with liquid
masses, as in ʿa wiğh al-mwayyih ‘on the surface of the water.’32
5.1.1
Sentence/Scene Pointing Match Experiment to Distinguish
between giddām, gabl, and ʿa wiğh
Pilot tests revealed the existence of further interesting and culture-specific dis-
tinctions regarding the selection of giddām, gabl, and ʿa wiğh that could not
be explained by spontaneous descriptions. In order to discriminate between
the application of these three prepositions in static spatial scenes across the
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ generations, I devised an experiment that I refer to here as Sentence/
Scene Pointing Match, inspired by previous observations during spontaneous
interactions between the speakers.
I selected six informants from each of the three age groups: the elderly
population, over seventy years of age; the middle-aged group, between fifty
and sixty-nine; and the (relatively) young population, between twenty-five
and forty-nine years of age, with equal numbers of men and women. Infor-
mants were tested individually. The experiment was based on the principle
of changing one semantic criterion at a time between two scenes proposed
as alternative reponses, with informants indicating which of the two pictures
best represented a sentence heard as a vocal stimulus produced by a native
speaker. The experiment captured the following semantic distinctions, which
had already proven to be salient in previous studies on traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and
Negev Arabic referential representations (Cerqueglini 2015; Cerqueglini and
Henkin 2018):
1.
± interactional distance
The two toy objects were placed at different
distances from each other, other, enabling or
not enabling interaction between them.
2.
± same ontological class
Both toy objects were of the same type
(human beings, horses, camels) or belonged
to different types.
3.
± same facing direction
Both toy objects faced or did not face the
same direction.
32
Hebrew pānīm ‘face’ is also used in the Bible in relation to horizontal surfaces, as in Gen-
esis 11: ʿal-pney kol ha-areṣ‘on the entire surface of the earth.’

The reference objects, used to locate the second objects, were selected from
familiar, culturally salient, faced, and mobile entities that proved to be attri-
buted to a front region in spatial projective relations (Cerqueglini 2015), includ-
ing, for example, human beings, horses, camels, donkeys, carnivorous animals
and birds of prey, knives, tents, and coffee pots. For this experiment, I selected
only a human being (aš-šēḫ‘the old man’) and a horse (al-faras al-mnaqqṭa
‘the dotted horse’). The objects to be located included the human being (aš-
šabb ‘the young man’), the horse (al-faras al-aḥmar ‘the brown horse’), and
a pole (al-ʿamūd symmetrical and inanimate). Both old man and the spotted
horse were reference objects combined with a human being (the young man),
a horse (the brown horse), and a pole, respectively. Each pair of answer scenes
represented the same pair of objects in the series of conditions with respect to
each of the three semantic parameters mentioned above. The entire stimulus
series included fifty sentences and one hundred response scenes. This exper-
iment was devised to test static relations (dynamic scenes were the object of
other investigations).
After a series of five trials conducted to check that each informant had prop-
erly understood the instructions, the actual experiment began. Each informant
listened to a short stimulus sentence spoken by a native speaker. Following
each stimulus sentence, I composed, with the same pair of toys, two separate
spatial scenes that differed from one another in terms of one the parameters
mentioned above, on a table placed in front of the informant. The informant’s
task was to indicate (by pointing, within five seconds) the scene that better
described the sentence heard. In this way, possible answers were reduced to
binary options, as shown in Figure 26 (the scenes are shown as they were seen
from the perspective of the informants during the test).
In Figure 26, both scenes satisfy criteria 1 and 2, as both entities belong to
the same type (human) and are at the same interactional distance. The only
difference is in the opposite values of Criterion 3, since in Scene 1, both old
man and young man are facing the same direction, while in Scene 2 they are
facing opposite directions, being turned toward each other.
After at least two different test scenes that included different objects with
the intention of preventing the first answer from influencing the second, the
same pair of stimulus scenes appeared again, in combination with an alter-
native preposition, as in Figure 27, where the stimulus sentence includes the
preposition gabl.
Scene 2 was chosen systematically. The same procedure was repeated for
the preposition ʿa wiğh. Results show clear tendencies among elderly speak-
ers: giddām is in general more frequently associated with scenes in which both
entities face the same direction, aligned in a row one behind the other, as in

Figures 27 and 28, Scene 1. The presence of positive values for interactional dis-
tance does not seem to be crucial for the selection of giddām, associated with
all scenes in which, even when facing one another, both entities are far from
one another’s reach, as in Figure 28, Scene 1.
The use of giddām is also common when the entities belong to different
types,such as humanbeingandhorse,orhumanbeingandpole(wheretheref-
erence object can only be the human being, in this case), as in Figure 29, Scene
1. Here, the entities belong to different types: the young man, to be located,
and the old man and the spotted horse, in relation to which the young man
is located.33 In both scenes, the entities face one another at the same interac-
tional distance. Giddām was in general preferred when the objects belonged
to different types, while gabl was always used when both faced entities faced
each other and belonged to the same type, especially if both were humans (as
exemplified by Figure 29, Scene 2).

salient in giddām as they are in gabl. Indeed, in a row or a line, generally asso-
ciated with giddām, mutual affordance and ability to interact are less relevant
than when two faced entities face each other, especially if they belong to the
same type, and especially if they are both humans; the mutual facing scene
indeed represents prototypical human–human interaction, conversation, and
all meetings.
The idea of alignment according to the same line and in the same direction
is close to the idea of proceeding in a line, i.e., to forward motion. The etymo-
logical connection of giddām with the root for foot in Arabic varieties echoes
the motor implication that is probably at the semantic core of this preposition.
The following examples from various corpora of Negev Arabic and related vari-
eties support the existence of this kind of proto-scene of giddām, entailing the
idea of this type of alignment:
Negev Arabic: giddām ‘ahead, forward, fore’ and ‘in the future’ (Shawār-
bah 2007: 154);
Rwala: tāḥoḏʿan al-ğejš židdām ‘keep ahead of other riders’ (Musil 1928:
367);

Najd: gidmih, gidmik ‘in front of it, ahead of you, on your way’ (Kurper-
shoek 1994: 428).
Unlike giddām, gabl seems to be originally related to the concept of facing,
which was then specialized for the reciprocal facing of two-faced beings, with
similardegreesof facedness(prototypicallytwohumanbeings)positionedone
across from the other at an interactional distance. In the context of the concept
of facing and mutual facing, Shawārbah (2012: 376) reported the word gibīl as
‘opponent,’ in legal contexts, gabal, with the meaning of both ‘woman’s face’
and ‘to the direction of,’ and gbāl ‘in the presence of.’ Here some examples of
spatial uses of g.b.l., also from different Bedouin varieties, with similar mean-
ings, entailing the concept of (mutual) facing:
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ: mgābala ‘facing each other;’
(other) Negev Arabic: mgēbil ‘in front of, against’ (Alʿatāmīn 2011/1: 73),
agbal ‘to approach’ (Henkin 2010: 312);
gabal ‘opposite’ (Shawārbah 2007: 154);
w-iḏ̣ḏ̣all gabalhī ‘and he remained in her presence’ (Shawārbah 2007:
273);
Rwala: w-eʿreḏ̣ūneh ḳbāli ‘and set her before me’ (Musil 1928: 190);
Najd: gbal ‘in front of, ahead of, in the front part of’ (Kurpershoek 1994:
441),
miğbil ‘approaching’ (Kurpershoek 1994: 441),
agbal ‘to appear, to approach, come forward’ (Kurpershoek 1994: 441).
Giddām, whose semantic space seems larger than that of gabl, can replace it in
all cases and indeed frequently does so. Another interesting observation is that,
despite gabl being the default option for scenes of meeting and confrontation
among humans, when one person is facing a group of people, giddām is used,
not gabl, which seems to be confined to the prototypical situation of a dialogue
or one-on-one interaction, as shown in Figure 30.
As for ʿa wiğh, except for its uses in connection with liquid surfaces, it is ten-
dentially confined to specific functions, such as the markedly improper close-
ness of some object to someone’s face, felt as interactionally non-prototypical,
dysfunctional, or culturally abusive, limiting, and challenging. The wiğh is not
only the ‘face’ but also the presence, the interactional space, the personal
sphere, where personal values and qualities are expressed and cultural and
sociopolitical functions carried out.34 The violation of this personal space is
marked by the use of ʿa wiğh, as exemplified in Figure 31, Scene 1.

Scene 2 in Figure 31 was associated with the alternative sentence containing
the preposition giddām. Nonetheless, in real-life interactions, ʿa wiğh is com-
monly heard in combination with motion verbs of the take/put type, when
something bulky and cumbersome is placed close to someone’s face so as to
prevent him/her from seeing something, moving forward, and so on, as in the
following sentence, heard during the fieldwork when a grandmother scolded
her daughter for putting the baby stroller of her newborn child just in front
of her, while she was sitting cross-legged on the mattress, chatting with other
women:

5.2
Spatial Posteriority: The ‘Back’ Region
The basic preposition used to describe the back region is wara. The root w.r.y.
has no further nominal outcomes. Its etymology is related to the verb ‘to hide,’
‘to conceal from sight’ (third form, fāʿala) and, in even more abstract terms,
‘to confuse’ and ‘to lie’ (Lane 1968: Supplement/3052). Indeed, wara expresses
both the meaning of ‘behind’ and ‘beyond,’ as in Najd (Kurpershoek 1994: 479)
and Rwala, e.g., šamsenbadatliminwaraḥātal-ğāl ‘like the sun appearing from
behind the long wall of mountain’ (Musil 1928: 177), wara-ṭ-Ṭawīl ‘beyondṬawīl’
(p. 209), tiffen ʿala-d-dinya warāha l-mamāti ‘a spit on a world beyond which is
death’ (p. 319), and in south Arabian varieties usaffir ilya waral-Ḥdâli teʿaddey,
‘et active la marche jusqu’à ce que tu sois passé au delà de Ḥadâli’ (de Landberg
1909: 1367–1368).
In archaic aṣ-Ṣāniʿ expressions, uttered exclusively by some elders, I could
still hear the human body parts ʿugb ‘heel’35 (ʿaqib, Lane 1968: vol. 5/2100) and
gafa ‘the back of the neck’ (qafā, Lane 1968: Supplement/2086) used as spatial
prepositions to express posteriority, as they are still used in St. Catherine’s Jbāli
35

(Nishio 1996). Gafa is reported in Shawārbah (2012: 386) as both noun ‘back’
and preposition ‘behind,’ i.e., in its spatial use. This meaning was reported by
Brockelmann (1913/2: 422). As Procházka reports (1993: 236), this spatial prepo-
sition is present from Mauritania to southern Arabia, Jordan, Damascus, and
Anatolia. In Mauritania and northern Yemen, it is the default preposition for
‘behind.’ Already recessive among the elders, spatial uses of ʿugb and gafa are
absent from the generational varieties of the middle-aged and young speak-
ers.

From Space to Time
The impact of spatial orientation on our understanding of time has largely
beenconsideredanobviousphenomenon,evidentingrammarsandlexiconsof
many of the world’s languages (Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976: 375; Lyons 1977:
718;Svorou1994).Lakoff (1993:218)assumesthatourmetaphoricalunderstand-
ing of time in terms of space is biologically determined: ‘In our visual systems,
we have detectors for motion and detectors for objects/locations. We do not
have detectors for time […]. Thus, it makes good biological sense that time
should be understood in terms of things and motion.’ A number of cognitive
and psycholinguistic experiments have supported the notion that to repre-
sent time, languages rely on space (Boroditsky et al. 2010). Cross-linguistic and
cross-cultural enquiry largely supports the ‘space-to-time metaphor’ hypoth-
esis, stressing that the way in which people spatialize time differs across lan-
guages and cultures depending on the available spatial representations, spatio-
temporal metaphors, cultural artifacts, and individual disposition, age, and
experience (Casasanto and Boroditsky 2008; Fuhrman and Boroditsky 2010).
These studies have demonstrated that different cultures differ in terms of
whether they think of time as stationary or moving; limited or open-ended;
horizontalor vertical;orientedfromlefttoright,righttoleft,fronttoback,back
to front, east to west; and so on. On the grammatical marking of time on verbs,
i.e., the domain of tense and aspect, there is a sizable body of cross-linguistic
researchthatdemonstratesthattheuseof spatialperiphrasticexpressionsisby
no means geographically, genetically, or typologically limited (Anderson 1973;
Traugott 1978). Furthermore, a study conducted by Boroditsky and Gaby (2010)
showed that just as Australian languages use cardinal directions to represent
cognitive and linguistic spatial relations between objects, they use cardinal
directions(theeast/westaxis)intemporalrepresentations,i.e.,toexpressante-
riorityandposteriority(before/after)betweenevents.Thiswassurprising,asall
previous studies in other cultures had found temporal representations derived

from spatial representations relative to the ego of the observer/speaker. Nev-
ertheless, the ‘space-to-time,’ or ‘space-first’ hypothesis has recently been chal-
lenged by the empirical evidence that humans directly perceive and feel the
passage of time (Evans 2004).
In this section, I will show the usage-based distribution of two doublets of
temporal prepositions, giddām and gabl, which express spatial anteriority, and
waraandbaʿd,whichexpresstemporalposteriority.Thespatialprepositionsfor
‘front’ are used in the temporal domain for anteriority, while the spatial prepo-
sition wara, used for ‘back,’ indicates temporal posteriority, as is common in
otherlanguages(ShinoharaandMatsunaka2010).While warahasbeentreated
among spatial prepositions expressing posteriority, baʿd is used in the language
of the elders only in temporal contexts.
6.1
Temporal Anteriority: ‘Before’
Giddām and gabl are both used in the domain of time to express the temporal
relation of anteriority, English ‘before,’36 within the Negev as in other Bedouin
languages, for example:
Marāzīg (Tunisia)
giddām ez-zrūg ‘before sunrise’ (Boris 1958: 33),
Rwala (Jordan)
mā rawwah w-amse židdāmek ‘(by that who) lies down to
sleep before thee in the evening’ (Musil 1928: 430),
gabl alawwala ‘before yesterday’ (Musil 1928: 75),
Jbāli (Sinai)
darast geddām γada ‘I studied before lunch’ (Nishio 1992:
164),
An-Nwēbʿa (Sinai)
jebren hīt ḳabl ʿašra lejāli ‘(in order to) reach Hīt befoe the
tenth night’ (Marom 2012: 314).
Both roots, g.d.m. and g.b.l., also produce temporal adverbs, nouns, conjunc-
tions, and adjectives:
Prepositions
giddām al-ġada ‘before noon’ (Shawārbah 2012: 219),
gabl ṯalāṯlēlāt ‘three days ago’ (Shawārbah 2012: 3250).
Nouns
gbīlān(ih) ‘less than an hour ago,’ ‘shortly before’ (Shawārbah
2012: 376),
gabl ams ‘the day before yesterday’ (Shawārbah 2012: 376),
gidīmit flān ‘Fulān’s ex-wife’ (Shawārbah 2012: 376).
Conjunctions
giddām ma ymūt ‘before he dies’ (Shawārbah 2012: 219),
gabil aḥna ninwiğid ‘before we were created’ (Shawārbah 2012:
274),
36
In an-Nwēbʿa wuğh also grammaticalizes into a preposition of temporal anteriority, wuğh
aḏ̣ḏ̣uhr ‘before noon’ (Marom 2012: 75).

chapter 4
gabl la-yarkab ‘before he rode’ (Henkin 2010: 232),
gabl aš-šams taṭlaʿ ‘before the sun rose’ (Henkin 2010: 258).
Adjectives
az-zamān al-gidīm means ‘the ancient time’ (personal field-
work),
at-turāṯal-gidīm ‘the old traditions’ (Henkin 2010: 266),
an-nās al-gdæm ‘the people [of] long ago’ (Henkin 2010: 310).
Adverbs
gabil ‘before’ (Shawārbah 2012: 376),
la-giddām ‘ahead’ (Shawārbah 2012: 376).
Interestingly, while roots related to the prepositions that express anteriority in
space produce a series of spatial verbs (gabbal to go south, to turn toward the
Qiblah; agbal to approach; wağğah to turn, to come back;37 gaddam to put in
front), they do not produce temporal verbs. This may be counterevidence of
the primacy of spatial meanings over derived, secondary, temporal meanings.
The only exception I found is in Najdi Arabic, in the verb wajjah ‘to set out in
the afternoon’ (Kurpershoek 1994: 478), which derives from a spatial concept
and contains a temporal signal.
According to my informants’ intuition, in its temporal application, giddām
designates a distant past, ‘long before’ rather than ‘before.’ For example, in
Sinaitican-NuwēbʿaArabic,minal-gidimhasthemeaningof ‘longago’(Marom
2012:253),whileinRwalamingidīmmeans‘fromtimeimmemorial’(Musil1928:
441). From the examples reported above, it also seems that giddām expresses a
more remote anteriority than gabl. Other examples of the same distant mean-
ing of giddām in the Negev, referring to historical events in a relatively distant
past, are found in:
ugiddæm yiṣl al-balad ‘and before he reached the country;’
henkin 2010: 364
giddēmḫamsīnsanah,giddēmIṣrāyēlitṣīr ‘fiftyyearsago,beforeIsraelwas
created.’
alʿatāmīn 2011/1: 187
In an-Nwēbʿa, ḳabl is translated as ‘long ago’ in a poetic passage, yet this is prob-
ably only due to a play on words created to produce an effect of assonance with
the word ‘heart’:
mašrūf ḳalbi ḳabl ḳalbak ‘renowned was my heart long before thine.’
marom 2012: 296
37
Giddām ma twağğih ‘before she comes back’ (Shawārbah 2012: 219).

153
The liaison between g.d.m., g.b.l., and temporal anteriority is not actually
univocal, as the position of ‘anteriority’ with respect to the here-and-now of
the utterance is not stable, as what is ‘before’ and ‘in front’ can be related to the
past or the future. Indeed, the adverb giddām means ‘in the future,’ as in:
bitḥawwših byanfaʿak giddām ‘what you store will be for your advantage
in the future;’
shawārbah 2012: 376
giddām, allī yuṭlub lih gaṣabah aʿṭīha yāh ‘in the future, whoever asks for
a flute, I will give it to him;’
shawārbah 2012: 309
giddām btibni lak dār ‘in the future, you will build yourself a house;’
shawārbah 2007: 155
giddām ‘in the future.’
shawārbah 2007 : 154
Similarly, g.b.l. also carries a meaning related to temporal posteriority in al-
gābil, which means ‘tomorrow night’ (Shawārbah 2012: 376), alternating with
the form gāblih ‘tomorrow evening’ (Shawārbah 2007: 259).
These apparent inconsistencies probably reveal the interference of different
cognitive systems according to which the spatial axis has been perceived, prob-
ably in different eras or due to linguistic contact. Such historical and cognitive
aspects are currently being investigated, but remain beyond the scope of the
present work.
6.2
Temporal Posteriority
Among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, wara has temporal connotations, meaning ‘after’ in the
denominations of future days: al-yōm allī warah ‘the day after it;’wara al-gāblih
‘after tomorrow evening’ (Shawārbah 2007: 259), probably because future pos-
teriority entails a certain value of invisibility, namely, unpredictability. In other
words, to establish the relations between two future events, gabl is used to
express future anteriority and wara future posteriority, progressively substi-
tuted by baʿd, as summarized in Figure 32.
Etymological reflexes of classical Arabic warāʾa (Esseesy 2010) regularly
express temporal representations in Maltese, in the Judeo-Arabic variety of
Tafilalt, and in Ḥassānīya, and less systematically, or only sporadically, in other
dialects, eastern and western, as in the following examples (from Procházka
1993: 203):

across temporal and spatial meanings:

In Alʿatāmīn (2011/1: 112), al-ʿigbih, etymologically connected with ʿugb, desig-
nates the concept of genealogy. In Najdi Arabic, ʿagāb means both ‘rear part’
and ‘consequences’ (Kurpershoek 1994: 425). Shawārbah (2012: 365) reports
ʿugb as ‘after,’ with temporal meaning only, as it is used among the largest seg-
mentof aṣ-Ṣāniʿspeakerstodayandwasatthetimeof myfieldwork.Theprepo-
sition is etymologically connected with spatial verbs (ʿagab ‘to come after, to
follow,’ ʿaggab ‘to leave behind’), with the name ʿagāb ‘rest, remainder,’ used in
ʿagāban-nahār ‘attheendof theday,timebeforesunset’(Shawārbah2012:365).
The Rwala ʿoḳob and an-Nuwēbʿa ʿugb have mainly temporal connotations:
mā ḥadd rawwaḥlīy ʿugbah ‘nobody came to me after him;’
marom 2012: 73

Nonetheless, in the Negev, spatial connotations of ʿugb still exist, as in wāḥid
ʿugb aṯ-ṯānī ‘one after another’ (Henkin 2010: 308).39 In Rwala, Musil reported
the spatial adverbial use of oʿḳob ‘away!’ (1928: 288), connecting the back region
with the concept of remoteness.40 The spatial use is today very seldom heard
among middle-aged and young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.41

This example could be both temporal and spatial.

Musil reports the spatial adverbial use of oʿḳob ‘away!’ in Rwala (1928: 288). This meaning
of the word connects the back region with the concept of remoteness. The connection
between ‘back’ and ‘distant’ is probably located in the scarce visual control and inter-
actional potential inherent to the back region, what makes it more cognitively remote
compared to the opposite, front region.The cognitive bias toward linking posteriority and
distance is probably also the cause for the etymological relationship between baʿd, ‘after,’
expressing posteriority in time, and biʿīd ‘far.’

In addition to ʿugb, the body part, ḏ̣ahr ‘back,’ is entailed in spatial and temporal descrip-

chapter 4
The absolutely most frequent preposition to indicate temporal posteriority
is baʿd, while wara and ʿugb are both clearly recessive over the generations in
the domain of time. Baʿd is the only temporal preposition for posteriority in
middle and young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ varieties. As for the morphological realizations of
baʿd and their distribution and functions across Arabic varieties, alone or in
combination with prepositional heads, a helpful summary is provided by Proc-
házka (1993: 83–86). Baʿd is etymologically correlated to the spatial concept of
distance, expressed in the verb abʿad ‘to go far’ (iv form), and the attribute biʿīd
‘far.’ The root b.ʿ.d. does not produce temporal verbs, yet it produces one noun,
baʿadih ‘the day aftertomorrow,’and the adverbbaʿadēn ‘then,afterwards,later’
(Shawārbah 2012: 371).
In all the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ generational varieties ʿugb and baʿd seem to be clearly dis-
tinguishable according to clear semantic oppositions, as is the case of giddām
and gabl. In the variety spoken by the elders, ʿugb and baʿd seem, rather, to be
interchangeable, and this could be one of the reasons for the progressive reces-
sion and the disappearance of one of the two, namely ʿugb.
Among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders, baʿd has only temporal meanings, while among
the middle-aged and young speakers, baʿd assumes spatial values, as in the fol-
lowing example.
In general, the use of baʿd in spatial terms must be associated with deictic
strategies, in which an effect of fictive motion accompanies the perspective of
the observers from their first position beyond the reference object until they

from the observer than the reference object, i.e., it is reached later in a real or
fictive motion act.The scene reported in Figure 33 is processed in deictic terms
across all generations of aṣ-Ṣāniʿ speakers, yet according to different referen-
tial styles, as shown below. The response reported in the example attests to the
collapse of a previously used referential style and the attempt to construct new
solutions, in which speakers negotiate the position of anteriority and posteri-
ority with respect to a symmetric reference object (tree).

at noon the sun reaches the peak of its arc in the sky, which is associated with the shape

based on four (or more) legs, are similar to the back of a quadruped. In Jbāli, ḏ̣ahar is fully

semantic sense of roundness and arching related to the root ḏ̣.h.r. is also expressed Najdi

Giddām/Gabl: Temporal Distance-Based Opposition as Spatial
Inheritance
As seen in Subsection 5.1.1 above, the use of giddām and gabl is selected on the
basis of three fundamental semantic parameters. One of these is the reciprocal
distance between both elements of the spatial scene, the object to be located
and the object in relation to which the former is located. In order for gabl to be
used,thedistancebetweenthetwoobjectsmustbesuchthatitallowsforinter-
action between them, while giddām is used instead in all other cases, i.e., when
the interaction is prevented for some reason, including too great a distance, as
shown in Figure 28. Further examples from the distance-based distribution of
giddām and gabl are represented in Figure 34. Figure 34 depicts some random
examples of stimulus scenes described by elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informants.
The spatial use of gabl requires interactional closeness between two enti-
ties, while giddām is independent of this parameter, being associated also with
greater, even non-interactional, distances (in Figure 34, Scenes 1 and 3, the old
man is turning his back to the woman, so their interactional potential is low).
This also seems to be the case for other Arabic dialects, especially in their
traditional varieties, where temporal uses of giddām are also associated with

greater temporal intervals between two events or between the events and the
observer’s here-and-now than the intervals expressed by gabl. The distance-
based opposition between giddām and gabl in the domains of space and time
is progressively lost over the middle-aged and young generations. Nonetheless,
the temporal opposition is more easily recognized, even among young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
speakers, than the spatial one, probably because giddām is heard in the spe-
cific context of elders’ narrations, so its referents are clearly very distant in

time. Different values for the criteria of spatial alignment and facing direc-
tions are not directly encoded by alternative grammatical choices in middle
and young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, so giddām and gabl are perceived by these speak-
ers as synonymous options for spatial anteriority.This cross-generational trend
indicates a progressive neutralization of the semantic oppositions based on
distance, whose disappearance occurs first in the domain of space and, more
slowly, in the domain of time. As has long been accepted (Svorou 1994), the
time domain is linguistically a semantic ‘periphery’ of the domain of spatial
relations, and therefore represents a more conservative pool of options. Spatial
distance might actually have once represented a nuclear criterion for preposi-
tional selection, as is well exemplified in Jbāli Arabic.
Jbāli Arabic divides both spatial front and back regions into two distance-
basedareas:‘near’and‘far.’Thedistance-basedsemanticdistinctionisencoded
by two prepositional doublets, as shown in Figure 35.
The persistence in Jbāli of archaic semantic criteria should not be surpris-
ing. This variety has, in fact, proved to be conservative in the sphere of spatial
semantics in terms of other aspects as well, such as, for example, the impor-
tance of the alignment criterion. The alignment criterion has proved to be fun-
damentalfortheaṣ-Ṣāniʿeldersinmanyways,asIshowbelow,andisexpressed
by special prepositional strategies different from those used in spatial rela-
tionships in which the alignment criterion is not satisfied. The importance of
the condition of alignment between the objects of a spatial scene and/or with
the position of the observer lessens through the generations, until it is unde-
tectable among young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ people.

criterion of alignment. Both representations indicate proximity between two
entities along the lateral axis that in English would be translated in both cases
as ‘beside.’ But one preposition, fṭōl, indicates the presence of more than two
entities arranged in alignment along the lateral axis, a semantic scheme that is
not encoded in English, French, Spanish, Italian, or other European languages,
and is probably very rare or even unique in absolute terms. The other prepo-
sition, jamb (from: janb side), on the other hand, indicates the simple lateral
relationship between two entities, in which the condition of a wider alignment
context is not present.
Nishionoticesthatwhilethefront/backaxisisprocesseddifferentlydepend-
ing on the criterion of distance, the lateral relations are expressed in different
ways ‘in accordance with the pattern of arrangement, not with the pattern of
closeness’ (1996: 194). As Nishio (1996) demonstrates extensively, Jbāli exploits
the criterion of greater/smaller distance between located object and refer-
ence object along the up/down axis as well, with two different prepositions
for the upper part, fōg, ‘on’ and ‘above’ (close), and min ḥard, ‘above’ (dis-
tant) (1996: 193). The exact metric distance that discriminates between these
prepositions is nevertheless not further explained by the author. This lack of
explanation makes it difficult to capture their distribution, since greater and
smaller distances are relative concepts. A clearer metric reference is given to
distinguish the uses of deictic pronouns/adjectives, of which there are three in
Jbāli Arabic: nhāni and heni (here), and henōt (there), the first indicating the
space reachable by the hand, the second the proximal space beyond the hands’
reach, and the third distant space (Nishio 1996: 195). The condition of align-
ment between entities in the spatial scenes and/or with the observer proved
to be productive for the selection of different prepositional strategies in tradi-
tional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, while the parameter of alignment is recessive in other genera-
tions.

The Inherent Partitions of Animals
In addition to domestic animals, wild animals that do not live close to humans
or frequently interact with them are processed according to an inherent bod-
ily partition. These include wolves, local jackals called wāwī, wild cats, snakes,
spiders, and birds of prey. Their motor skills, cunning, and other traits are fre-
quently observed during hunting trips and celebrated in poetry and proverbs,
as reported in the following examples from Sinai and the Negev. Alʿatāmīn
reports a very vivid portrayal of a hunting scene, a snapshot from the narra-
tion of a hunting trip, on the trail of a wolf:
(6) w-allahwal-xayyālihwarāh,warāh.hal-ḥīnlammašāf al-xayyālih,huw
xāf, wallah w al-klēb kōmān warāh, u yaṭlaʿ wallah … ṭalʿū tagrīban al-biṭīn,
waṣlū siddant al-biṭīn, hah as-siddānih, as-siddānih tagrīban ma ṭalʿū ʿala
rās al-biṭīn
‘(6) and here the knights are behind him, behind him. Now, as he saw the
knights he was afraid, and also the dogs were behind him, and he went
up, by God, they almost reached the mountain, they reached to the fore-
head42 of the mountain, yes the forehead, almost to the forehead, they
did not reach up to the head43 of the mountain.’
alʿatāmīn 2011/1: 94
Interestingly, both riding animals and wild animals, whose bodies are inher-
ently partitioned in the domain of spatial relations, just as the human body is,
are also central characters in the traditional literature and in the metaphoric
texture of its didascalic language. They are recognized as having human atti-
tudes, feelings, and behaviors, sometimes calling for empathy and identifica-
tion, or arousing disappointment and blame, as in the following examples:
zay sawān ʿ-al-ḥamād
‘Like donkey droppings on a flat stony plain (said of a useless thing)’;
bailey 2004: 19
42
The narration of the hunting trip aaz.T.afaṣ6, al-xayyālih in Alʿātamīn (2011/2) contains
several names of body parts used to partition geographic landmarks. The ‘forehead’ of the
mountain is the upper frontal part of the mountain top (Alʿātamīn 2011/1: 94). The human
‘forehead’ is variously used across Levantine Arabic varieties. In the Galilee, the forehead,
called ṣubāḥ, related to the word ‘morning,’ the first/upper part of the day. In fact, the root
is connected by the authors to the meanings ‘brightness’ and ‘shine’ (Behnstedt and Geva-
Kleinberg 2019: 158). In rural Palestinian dialects, the day also has a chest, ṣidr, a word
metonymically used in a famous poem by Maḥmud Darwish, Ila Ommi ‘To my Mother.’

The head of the mountain is its very top, as I will show below.

Of particular interest is the crow, with its different connotations, positive and
negative. All wild animals who can survive the barrenness of the desert have
some value and virtue in the eyes of the Bedouins. The crow, for example, is
prudent and can often outsmart its enemies:
galbah zay galb al-ġarāb
‘His heart is like the crow’s heart (said of somebody who can escape dan-
gers).’
bailey 2004: 20
But the crow also rejoices on the ruins of abandoned encampments, where
it finds food left by humans. The bird’s clamorous cawing announces to the
Bedouins the presence of a devastated place, or a village abandoned for a
migration, arousing feelings of loss, bereavement, and mourning:
zay al-ġarāb illī yizʿag f-il-ḫarāb
‘He is like a crow that croaks upon ruins.’
bailey 2004: 20
The crow is thus a symbol associated with feelings of loss, abandonment, and
separation. It is not considered a harbinger of mournful news, as it usually

is in European folklore (Shannon 2018), but rather the herald of separations,
departures, and distances. Across Bedouin cultures, its cawing may announce
the separation of two lovers, as in the proverbial expression ġrāb al-bēn, ‘the
crow of parting’ (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2016: 192; Kurpershoek 1995; Shawār-
bah 2012: 392). The name of the crow derives from the root ġ.r.b., a homo-
phone of the root from which the word for the direction ‘west’ derives or
perhaps identical to it. West is the direction of the sunset and the sea of the
pre-Islamic and Islamic afterlife, but it is also the outermost space of migra-
tions toward foreign, outside the Bedouin desert homeland and the bonds
of affection and blood. Alʿatāmīn (2011/1: 84) pointed to the strongly nega-
tive expression uġrub ʿin wijhī! ‘Get away from my face!’ and ‘Get out of my
sight!’ from the same root. Among the Negev Bedouins, familiarity and alien-
ation and proximity and distance are fundamental cultural components in the
social and ritual organization of space and of entities dwelling in the space.
Thus, almost human characteristics are attributed to some well-known ani-
mals with which one can identify and empathize. These animals are at the
center of the deep symbolic nuclei of traditional lore and part of the com-
plexsystemof contradictoryvaluesof identity,andtheyembodytheexistential
attitudes of human beings. In the domain of space, these creatures are per-
ceived as motor intelligent, capable of following trajectories, autonomous, and
therefore inherent parts of the body, such as those of the human body, are
attributed to them, that is, they have their own anterior and posterior direc-
tions, lexicalized as giddām and wara, respectively. The same is not true for all
animals.
As I will demonstrate in the experimental part of this work, other animals,
familiar,suchassheepandgoats;culturallyalien,suchascows,unfamiliar,such
as giraffes; or foreign, such as dinosaurs, are not recognized as having front
and back regions in the domain of space and are processed according to car-
dinal directions or to the observer’s perspective not only on the right/left axis
but also on the front/back axis. This does not mean that the Bedouins do not
recognize a detailed anatomy in these animals, but only that their body parts
have no effect in the semantics of projective spatial relations, which I address
here.

ture,44 such as the tent, as discussed above, and geographic landmarks such
as wadis, hills, mountains, and other topographic configurations of the desert
landscapes. Below, I report some examples from textual sources in Negev Ara-
bic varieties (mainly from Alʿatāmīn 2011), other Bedouin Arabic dialects, and
my experiments.
To test the location and extension of each body part term, I performed two
experiments on six elderly informants, three women and three men, concern-
ing the regional partition of mountain and wadi. The word ‘mountain’ usually
translates to the Negev Arabic ğabal, but also to gōz and biṭīn. In aṣ-Ṣāniʿ,
the distinction between these three words is blurred. The only explanation I
received from ʿAbdelraḥmān was that gōz is probably more roundish in shape,
more like a tall. In Shawārbah (2012: 374) biṭīn is translated with both ‘hill’ and
‘mountain.’ Biṭīn is explained by Alʿatāmīn (2011/1: 85) as a synonym of ğabal.
Gōz in Shawārbah (2012: 390) is translated only as ‘hill.’ In Alʿatāmīn (2011/1:
89), gōz is translated as the top of a high mountain (biṭīn), used to describe
an optimal outpost, e.g., when looking for lost animals. In the inner Arabian
desert, among the Āl Murrah, goz (sic) designates a small, sandy hill, a type of
sand dune (Cole 1975: 32). A sandy height is also the definition of qawz given
in Lisān al-ʿarab (5/3773, Ibn Manẓūr 1994 ed.).Wadi corresponds to its original
common Arabic form wādī.
To establish the location of the body parts projected onto natural land-
marks such as the mountain and the wadi, I showed the informants a series
of ten short video clips (ten seconds each), five of which included the moun-
tain and five the wadi. In the clips, a male figure moved in slow motion45
against the background landmark, following different paths. The informants
were requested to describe the clips in detail, mentioning on which parts of
the mountain and the wadi the man was moving, as in Figure 37.
Movements were largely based on the information extracted from the back-
ground literature (Alʿatāmīn 2011/1: 91–97; Nishio 1996). A series of seventeen
human body parts was elicited by the test. Table 2 reports pictures from the
experimental sessions on each body part associated with the mountain and
the wadi and the related definitions given by Alʿatāmīn (2011) and Shawārbah
(2012).

Establishing Body Parts’ Extensions on Geographic Landmarks
a
Asmountainsarelocatedtowardtheeast(Jordan)fromtheperspectiveof theaṣ-Ṣāniʿlands,elderlyinfor-
mants often read images containing mountains according to the actually experienced position of these
landmarks.This happens especially with pictures and images shown with the vertical support of the com-
puter screen, which were more difficult to interpret within the cultural parameters of the tribal elders.
Thus, in this case, as the mountain is conceived by default as being to the east of the informant and the
man’s silhouette is facing toward the right of the screen, the silhouette is described as facing south. Dur-
ing the experiment, the informant who produced this response was facing north. Facing directions and
walking directions of mobile objects are often mentioned by the informants, even though directions are
not the focus of the experiment and are not mentioned in the instructions.
b As happens with mountains, images of a wadi are also interpreted according to the actual direction of the
main water stream, from north to south. Thus, in this case, the man’s silhouette, being to the left of the
wadi, is said to be west of the wadi. During the experiment, the informant who produced this response
was facing east.
copies, on A4 paper. Informants were tested individually. They were requested
to color or circle with a pencil each area covered by each body part term on
a different sheet. Both the mountain and the wadi regions were tested. This
second experiment was inspired by Van Staden and Majid (2006) for the elici-
tation of body parts’ extension across cultures.The results of both experiments
were quite homogeneous across the entire group. The data elicited clarify the
sometimes very general definitions provided by Alʿatāmīn (2011/1: 92–97) and
Shawārbah (2012, Glossary), as shown in Figure 38.

The word ‘heart’ is grammaticalized as ‘internal region’ in many languages, e.g., the An-
cient Egyptian ḥr ib ‘in the middle of’ and the Akkadian ina libbi ‘in the middle of’ (Rubin
2005: 47). In fact, the Egyptian word qȜb ‘intestine, in the midst of,’ could be a cognate of
Arabic qalb (Bedouin galb) ‘heart’ and Hebrew qereb ‘intestine, depth.’ Yet other specu-
lations are possible, such as Arabic qalb being a cognate of Arabic qulb ‘bracelet’ and of
Syriac qulbo ‘bracelet,’ (Corriente 1999) and Arabic maqlūb ‘turned’ or ‘wrapped,’ possibly
connected to Akkadian qulpu ‘encasement, bark of wood.’ The last meaning could also be
at the source of sedentary Palestinian Arabic ʿulba ‘box.’

Egyptian m-ʿ ‘in the hand of’ means ‘together with, from,’ while the Akkadian ina qāti
means ‘in the possession of’ (Rubin 2005: 47).

The plain is also called ḥamādih, as in the verse: šabbahtki l-al-iġzayyil fil-ḥamādih ‘To me
you are like a young gazelle in the plain’ (Borg 2009: 89).

Other body parts are used to describe the tent, as mentioned above: wiğh
‘face,’ for the tent entrance, also refers to the surface of a body of water such
as a lake or sea, so we have wiğh al-mwayyih ‘the water surface,’ or the cutting
side of a knife, wiğh as-sikkīn ‘the blade of the knife.’ With human bodies as
ground objects, wiğh can replace giddām as a projective spatial preposition,
fwjūh an-nās ‘in front of the people’ (Alʿatāmīn 2011/1: 81). Among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ,
the expression ʿa-wiğh, lit. ‘on the face (of)’ is used instead of giddām mean-
ing ‘in front of’ when the object is located too close or inappropriately close,
to someone’s face. The term ‘face’ grammaticalizes into a temporal preposi-
tion in the Sinaitic dialect of the an-Nuwēbʿa, e.g., wuğh aḏ̣ḏ̣uhur ‘before noon’
(Marom 2012: 75).
The word riğl, ‘leg,’ is used for the external back poles of the tent, while īd,
‘hand (including the forearm)’ designates the external front poles of the tent.
Across Bedouin dialects, īd also has a temporal meaning,53 īdān al-fağr, mean-
ing ‘à l’approche de l’aube’ (Boris 1958: 685), ‘just before dawn.’54 Īd is also used
to designate the handles of utensils.
It seems that in the Negev, the tent has also a ‘nape,’gafa, ‘the closed back of
the tent’ (Shawārbah 2012: 386), yet this is not so among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ. Finally, all
containers and mountain caves also have a mouth, afam, which designates the
entrance. Shawārbah (2012: 382) also reports the word afam in relation to the
entrance of the tent and the šigg, but it is no longer in use in this sense among
the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders.
Beyond human and animal body part terms, specific geomorphic terminol-
ogy is also used to describe parts of the mountain and the wadi. Thus, for
example, both mountain and wadi have a bottom, gaʿar (Shawārbah 2012: 385).
Inthecaseof themountain,thebottomisalsocalledbūr ‘plain,cultivatedland.’
The end of the wadi is said āḫiral-wādī ‘the last part of the wadi,’ while its bank
is called ṭaraf, the basic word for ‘edge,’ or šagg, the basic or for ‘side.’
Across Arabic dialects, other body parts have also been grammaticalized as
spatialregionsandevenprojectivespatialprepositions,asitisthecaseof ḫašm,
‘nose,’ grammaticalized as ‘in front of’ in southern Egypt (Procházka 1993: 190).
As Table 3 shows, in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, human and animal body parts usually
lexicalize only into spatial regions. In some cases, they become topological or
temporal prepositions, yet they rarely become projective spatial prepositions,
53
As in Hebrew miyyād, lit. ‘from hand,’ meaning ‘immediately,’ first attested to in Mishnaic
Hebrew (e.g., Gittin 6: 4).
54
In Sumerian, ‘hand’ is used to convey temporal rather than spatial concepts. The expres-
sion ‘from the hand of X’ means indeed ‘during the reign of X’ (Silvestri 2010). In Akkadian
‘hand’ designates ‘side, edge, border, span, or fathom (measure)’ (cad vii, 10).

The Nose, the Belly, and the Back of the Mountain
In Table 2, three body parts have not been indicated by an image because they
are processed differently across generations and require more detailed expla-
nation. During the two experiments performed to elicit the body parts pro-
jected onto mountains and wadis and their extension, I noticed that there was
general agreement about the location of ‘nose,’ ‘belly,’ and ‘back’ of the moun-
tain among the elderly speakers, yet the youngest members of the group of the
elders expressed some doubts and provided descriptions of concrete scenar-
ios instead of direct, general answers. Thus, I decided to also ask people from
the middle and the young generations about the meaning of these three terms,
for comparison, and discovered that across generations different strategies are
adopted to partition landmarks’ armatures, strictly depending on each gen-
eration’s lifestyle and relationship with the local natural elements and their
location in relation to the observer or the habitual position of the tribal group
in relation to the landmarks themselves.
The elderly Maryam, Niʿmih, Sarāb, Sarah, Hāğir, ʿAbdelkarīm, and others,
all over seventy years old, identified ḫašm, the ‘nose’ of the mountain, with a
rockyoffshoot,setintheupperpartof themountain,generallytowardthewest.
Surprisingly, the nounḫašm seemedtobeattributedbytheseeldersinabsolute

explicitly that the ḫašm always protrudes toward the observer, al-ḫašm mwağ-
ğih ʿalīk ‘the nose faces toward you (m.),’ a generic ‘you’ appellation, meaning
‘the one who observes’ in this case. He added that the mountains are to the
east (from the Negev), and we were west of the local mountains, which I gen-
erally identify here with the Seʿīr mountain chain, between Israel and Jordan.
So, facing ‘toward us’ (meaning toward the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ tribal lands in the Negev),
the ‘nose’ would always face west.
Other elderly speakers offered another kind of explanation, merely refer-
ring to inherent features of the mountain, saying that in general the nose of
the mountain is an offshoot protruding from the upper mountain flank, clearly
recognizableforitspointed,sharplysilhouettedcontour,clearlydetachedfrom

reported about the term ḫašm among the Rwala, ‘nose or steep spur of a ridge’
(1928: 679).
The explanation provided by ʿAbdelkarīm echoes the ancestral Bedouin
worldview, in which four mountains on the four sides of the world point
their noses toward the inhabited land, which extends in a core space between
these mountains, while beyond their backs, high rock faces plummet into the
ocean, which surrounds the earth chaotically in all directions.55 Musil pro-
vided this information, describing the Rwala beliefs regarding the shape of the
earth:
In the belief of the Bedouins and the Ṣlejb there is somewhere far beyond
the horizon a tall mountain on each side of the earth. On half of each
mountain rests on terra firma, the other half in the sea into which it sinks
abruptly, while towards the land it sends out a sharp spur called ḫašm.
These four mountains carry the whole firmament.

55
According to ancient mythological narrations found in Homer (Iliad 14, 201), Oceanus,
the primeval father of all gods (West 1997: 147), had the form of a deep world-encircling
river, eternally flowing back to itself. Oceanus was believed to separate the world of the
living from that of the dead. Hesiod locates Oceanus near Tartarus (Theogony 729–792),
while Homer says that it has to be crossed in order to reach the ‘dank house of Hades’
(Odyssey 10, 508–512), also known as erebos, ‘darkness.’ In Greek mythological thought,
Oceanus divided the internal known world of human life and light from an external space
of darkness and death, following exactly the positive connotations of the east and the
negative connotations of the west in a bipartite and pre-spherical vision of the world cos-
mology similar to the one observed here in Bedouin culture. A river was also believed
to encircle a flat-shaped or mountain-like earth in the ancient Babylonian and Assyrian
cosmologies (Jastrow 1898). The hypothesis of the word Ἔρεβος being loaned from some
Semitic language where ġ.r.b. had become ʿ.r.b is still fascinating, yet not supported. This
phonological passage occurred in Akkadian (where ʿ was written e, i.e., erebu), Canaanite,
Phoenician, and some South Semitic languages. Greek Ἔρεβος (Latin: erebus) is rather
connected to pie *h1regʷ-es/os- ‘darkness,’ from which also Sanskrit rájas, Gothic rikwis,
and Old Norse røkkr derive (Beekes 2009: 451). The etymology of ‘Europe’ is also still dis-
cussed as being from Greek eurys+ops, ‘wide-gazing’> ‘mainland,’ or from the Akkadian
erebu ‘sunset’ (Muss-Arnolt 1892: 35–156; Lewy, 1895) as opposed to asu, ‘sunrise,’ from
which the name Asia may have been derived. As Greek mythology reports, Europa was
the daughter of a Phoenician king, and her name could have been of Phoenician origin.

quadrants, which in a certain way correspond to different zones in terms of cli-
mate and atmosphere, is also found in the Christian apocalyptic literature:
After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, hold-
ing back the four winds of the earth to prevent any wind from blowing on
the land or on the sea or on any tree.
Revelation 7: 1
In several ancient cultures the earth is described as a flat plane, framed by four
corners. This does not necessarily entail any implication regarding the spheri-
cal vs flat shape of the earth. Ancient people indeed conceptualized the earth
as a globe, and represented it as such. Rather, the plane among the four corners
mayrepresentaspatio-temporaldimensionlimitedbythepositionsof thesun-
rise on the terrestrial horizon at both solstices and both equinoxes (Sullivan
1996).
From Musil’s passage, we learn that in the Rwala vision of the world, it is
set between four mountains that correspond to the four fundamental direc-
tions. According to an ancient tradition shared with other peoples of the
Mediterranean and the Middle East, the world is surrounded by water. The
four mountains turn their ḫušum noses towards the earth, the abode of men.
This description of the mountain’s ‘nose’ is similar to the description given
by the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders of the position of the ‘nose’ of the mountain, a projec-
tion that is turned ‘always toward us.’ Surely, as the closest mountains for taa
speakers are to the east, their ‘noses’ point west, toward the place where taa
speakers dwell, i.e., toward the Negev. In the traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ cultural con-
ception and representation of the relevant landmarks, the echoes of ancestral
pan-Bedouin visions of the world probably resonate. In the following lines of
Musil’s quotation, one can taste a primeval division of the cosmos, whereby the
šerḳ‘east’ and the ġarb ‘west’ (yeġarrebow) included the south and the north
respectively, since the east/west axis, determined by the course of the sun, was
the basic reference according to which the space was organized (Cerqueglini
and Henkin 2016). Indeed, from a broad comparative perspective, the same
analysis holds true in Indo-European languages, where the English word ‘east’
comes from the Middle English est (east) and the Old English ēast (east),
from the Proto-Germanic *austraz (east, eastern), from Proto-Indo-European
*h2ews- (dawn, east) and west comes from the Old English west (west), from
the Proto-Germanic *westrą (west), from *westraz (west), from Proto-Indo-
European *wek(ʷ)speros ‘evening.’ In contrast, the north/south axis derives
from secondary sources: ‘south’ comes from the Old English sūþ (south), from
the Proto-Germanic *sunþrą (south), from *sunþraz (south, southern), from

Proto-Indo-European *sóh2wl̥ ‘sun,’ as the apparent daily path of the sun is
slightly inclined toward the south. Its opposite, ‘north,’ comes from the Old
Englishnorþ(north),fromtheProto-Germanic*nurþrą(north,northern),from
*nurþraz (north, northern), from Proto-Indo-European *h1ner- (inner, under).
Middle-aged speakers, between fifty and sixty-nine years old, including
ʿAbdelraḥmān, Abū Gāsim, and Ḫalīl, told me after some hesitation that the
‘nose’ of the mountain was a rocky offshoot, set in the upper part of the moun-
tain, toward the observer, a purely relative description without cardinal impli-
cations. The verbal explanation entailed an interesting hand gesture, in which
ʿAbdelraḥmān moved his right hand back and forth in front of his nose, con-
necting an imaginary mountain nose and his own nose, as if both noses were
ideally contiguous. This gesture indicates that the metaphorical transfer from
the human nose to the mountain’s nose occurs when both objects are in a sort
of spatial connection where the observer can project his own body parts via
a transfer similar to a mirror reflection. Notably, young speakers between the
ages of twenty-five and forty-nine did not understand the word ‘nose’ in rela-
tion to the mountain at all.
Interestingly, a treatment similar to that reserved for ‘nose’ was also given to
biṭn and ḏ̣ahr(ah). Young speakers did not recognize any use of biṭn and ḏ̣ahr
as regions of a mountain. Some said, attempting to arrive at a possible intrinsic
option, that the ‘back’ of the mountain could be its top, because it is similar to
a hump.
Elderly speakers systematically reported that the biṭn, toward the west, was
the ideal part of the mountain on which to build an encampment, halfway
up to the top, protected from both floods and strong winds, ‘toward us, west-
ward,’ as they said of the ‘nose.’Ḏ̣ ahr is the opposite part in relation to biṭn, and
from the Negev it is toward the east, toward Jordan, the unseen part. Middle-
aged speakers said only that the biṭn faced the observer and the ḏ̣ahr was the
opposite side, unseen by them. The cardinal references were absent from the
description of the middle-aged and young speakers. Descriptions provided by
the elderly speakers were at once relative to the observers, ‘toward us,’ and car-
dinal, ‘toward the west.’
During the fieldwork, I explored the linguistic and cognitive implications of
the fact that for the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders, the mountains are always associated with
the eastern direction, as the only mountains they know in the vicinity of the
tribal lands are between the Negev and Jordan, to the east. Thus, the part of
the mountain that the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ traditionally see from their tribal lands was the
western part, where they used to camp in winter, while the eastern part was
concealed from sight, unless they decided to travel beyond the mountains to
Jordan for trade or tribal gatherings. In traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, the verb šar-

rag ‘to go east,’ from the same root as šarg ‘east,’ also means ‘to go uphill,’ while
the verb sannad, ‘to go up a mountain,’ is always associated with eastern refer-
ents (the cities of Ramallah, Hebron, and Jerusalem).
The ‘nose,’ ‘belly,’ and ‘back’ of the mountain are treated differently across
generations,reflectingthemoregeneralreferentialpreferencesof eachaṣ-Ṣāniʿ
generational group, from the strong intrinsic bias found among the young peo-
ple to the default absolute option among the elders, as I will show below.These
terms are indeed referents of the front and back regions, the only fully devel-
oped axis across the three generations, while, as mentioned, the left/right axis
is not available among the elders and is currently developing among the infor-
mants of the middle generation.
It is noteworthy that all cases in which body parts are attributed according
to different systems involve the mountain, not to the wadi: the inherent direc-
tionalitygiventothewadibythedirectionof itswaterstreammakesclearerthe

The Wadi as a Landmark in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and Jbāli Linguistic
Representations
There are numerous differences between aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and Jbāli in the names of the
mountain and wadi parts, as well as in the use that both languages make of
the wadi to structure projective spatial representations. As shown in Figure 38,
Drawing 8, in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ the word safḥah indicates the slope or flank/side of the
mountain, while in Jbāli safḥmeans ‘the foot of the mountain,’ and ḥarf the
slope (Nishio 1996: 196). Nagb refers in Jbāli to a plate-like part in or on the
mountain where one can find a path for camels or cars, while a similar concept
is found in the Negev Arabic word ʿargūb (see Figure 38, Drawing 11). Regard-
ing the wadi, the designations of its beginning and end are inverted in Jbāli,
with awwal curiously being the wadi’s end and āḫir the origin of the wadi, its
fōg ‘upper part.’ In aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, āḫir al-wādī means the wadi’s end, its mouth, or
the area where it disappears,56 while awwal al-wādī is its top, or rās ‘head’ (Fig-
56
In southern Arabia, in the Yemeni region of Aden, āḫir is the south, since the southern
part of the region coincides with the end of the peninsula and the beginning of the open
sea, as in the following example: wa-huwwa āḫir jebal el-aḫḍar ‘(Cette montagne) est la fin
(la pointe) sud de Jebal el-Aḫḍar’ (de Landberg 1909: 1325–1327).

ure38,Drawing12).57Jbālihasdevelopedaseriesof direction-encodingmotion
verbs related to this partition, with sannad ‘going up a slope,’ used to express
movement in the direction of the wadi top, i.e., ‘to go upriver,’ without refer-
ence to the actual inclination of the slope. In contrast, when referring to the
movement toward awwal wādī the wadi bottom (or entrance), sāḥor ṭabb ‘to
go downriver,’ are used (Nishio 1996: 199).
Behind these formal differences, a substantial and stunning phenomenon
differentiates between aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and Jbāli: the use of the wadi as a reference
landmark in projective spatial representations. As I explain in detail in the
chapter on spatial frames of reference, projective spatial representations dif-
fer from topological representations in that the object to be located (Figure)
and the reference object (Ground) are separated in space, therefore we need
to project onto the Ground a coordinate system that divides the space around
it into search sectors (directions) where the Figure can be found (Levinson
2003), e.g., front, back, right, left, east, west, north, south, uphill, downhill, by
the sea, by the mountain, inland, and others. In the case of the cardinal coor-
dinate system, its origin derives from the astronomical directions anchored
on the daily course of the sun, wind directions,58 or the position of some
celestial body, among other options. In the case of local coordinate systems
anchored on visible landmarks, the system derives from the position or ori-
entation of some chosen landmark, and differs in the way it is projected over
the area of interest. Figure 39 reports the typological classification of geocen-
tric strategies provided by Bohnemeyer (2011), which summarizes how coor-
dinate systems are extracted from a landmark and projected onto the spatial
scene.
Figure 39 shows three types of geocentric frames of reference, i.e., coordi-
nate systems based on a landmark. All three may be found to exploit the wadi
as a reference entity.The geomorphic type is based on the inherent direction of
the wadi, from its source ‘upriver,’ to its end ‘downriver,’ and indicates the direc-
tion of two objects set parallel to the water stream, so upriver and downriver
apply intuitively. The influence of the wadi as a landmark is thus found only
in the strip of territory parallel to its course. The landmark-based type is based
57
Awwal, lit. ‘first (part)’ derives from the root ʾ.w.l., from which the Hebrew word ʾūl ‘head,
chief’ and ʾūlām ‘porch in front of the house’ are yielded.
58
Arabic names of cardinal directions are found in Italian and in its regional varieties in
names of winds, e.g., scirocco ‘east or south-east wind,’ from š.r.g, used in standard Ital-
ian; garbino ‘west wind,’ from ġarbī, used in the Adriatic regions, from Veneto to northern
Puglia. Cardinal directions are also associated with wind directions in Italian, as in the
case of levante (lit. ‘rising’) for the east wind, and ponente (lit. ‘setting’) for the west wind.

on the position of the landmark in relation to the spatial scene, without refer-
ence to the inherent partition or directionality of the landmark. In our case, it
could be expressed by concepts such as ‘Figure is toward the river in relation to
Ground’ and ‘Figure is farther from the river in relation to Ground.’
In the absolute type, the upriver/downriverpartition of the wadiis extended
(abstracted) beyond the territorial strip parallel to its stream, so that when Fig-
ure and Ground are not found aligned along its banks, it is still possible to
establish an upriver/downriver relationship between them.
In Figures 40 and 43, I report a series of spatial scenes as actually described
by my elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informants and as they would be described in Jbāli
according to the uses reported by Nishio (1996: 197).The Figure object is a black
man silhouette (az-zalamih al-aswad ‘the black man’) and the Ground is a grey
man silhouette (az-zalamih ar-ramādī ‘the gray man’). Both men are in differ-
ent relative positions along a wadi. In Figure 40, I show the spatial scenes that
include the wadi as the origin of the coordinate system described in Jbāli by
the topological prepositions min ḥard, aʿlā, and asfal, with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ descrip-
tion elicited by six elderly informants. In Figure 43, the same comparison is
performed for the deictic projective prepositions jāy, lit. ‘coming toward the
observer’ and ġād, lit. ‘away from the observer.’

Figure 40 shows that the meaning of Jbāli prepositional strategies F min
ḥard/aʿlā G and F asfal G depends on F and G’s location in relation to the wadi
stream. In particular, asfal, which literally means ‘lower,’ being a comparative
afʿal form from the root s.f.l., ‘low,’59 also means ‘downstream from’ in Jbāli.
This is observable in all those cases where F and G are not located at differ-
ent geomorphic heights in relation to the plain or in relation to sea level, yet
the term asfal ‘lower’ is used. The wadi end is always associated with a lower
position than the wadi source, due to the empirical and routine knowledge of
the river streams flowing from higher to lower altitudes. On the other end, F
min ḥard G and F aʿlā G both have basic meanings as topological strategies in
Jbāli, approximately meaning ‘above’ and ‘on’ (lit. ‘higher’) along the up/down
axis. Nonetheless, min ḥard and aʿlā are polysemous, and when anchored in
the orientation field formed by the direction of the river stream, can assume
the projective meaning of ‘upstream.’
According to the examples reported by Nishio (1996), the Jbāli projective
uses of asfal, min ḥard, and aʿlā occur along the wadi stream and with the
wadiinsight,i.e.,accordingtothegeomorphicstrategyexemplifiedinFigure39
(Bohnemeyer 2011).Whether or not these prepositions are also abstracted from
the wadi stream and projected by Jbāli speakers onto a larger field, according
to the absolute strategy, remains to be tested.
Concerning the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ results, the regions of the wadi, rās and āḫir, do
become projective prepositions in combination with the wadi stream, assum-
ing the meaning of ‘upstream’ and ‘downstream’ respectively.This use has been
experimentally verified only when F and G are aligned along the upstream/
downstream axis along the wadi banks, with the wadi in sight, i.e., only accord-
ing to the geomorphic strategy shown in Figure 39.The wadi is never used as an
anchor for geocentric absolute representations. It should be emphasized that
the geomorphic use of the wadi landmark in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ is not very
popular. Indeed, only four informants gave this type of response, while the rest
preferred to use expressions like 1b and 2b here below, for Scenes 1 and 2 in
Figure 40, respectively:

the black man, southward.’ The grey man appears toward the end of the wadi,
with the black man upriver in relation to him. I noticed that in the actual loca-
tion of the experimental setting in which the description reported in Scene 2
of Figure 40 was elicited, the grey man, closer to the observer, was east of the
black man, while the black man, farther from the observer, was to the west. In
other words, the informant and I, close to him, were sitting east of the com-
puter screen, facing the computer screen, to the west: the black man was more
to the west than the grey one. Saying that the grey man was to the south did
not make sense to me. Even if the speaker was referring to the fact that the grey
man was more to the right of the screen than the black man, the right of the
screen would be the northern direction, not the southern, so I asked the infor-
mant what he meant. He said that the water in the Negev flows from north to
south, referring to the main drainage basin of the Jordan valley. Seeing a wadi
on the screen, he thought of a default representation of the water flow: the Jor-
dan River, i.e., the main flow in the local landscape, so by saying ‘southwards’
about Figure 40, Scene 2, he also meant ‘downstream.’
Speaking to a number of elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informants, however, it emerged
that as wadis flow in different directions over their land, mainly from east to
west, but often following twisted courses in different directions, they do not
use the wadis’ courses as anchors for local coordinate systems as the Jbāli do.
The Jbāli, on the other hand, live along the course of the Saint Catherine’s wadi,
at the bottom of the valley where the wadi expands and is lost in the flat desert
terrain, so a single, dominant, watercourse orients their existential space and
becomes a frame of reference that shapes their spatial representations.
Jbāli has also developed specific meanings for motion verbs used along the
wadi’s course. So, sannad, which in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ means ‘to go up a slope,’ in Jbāli
means ‘to go upstream’ along the wadi’s course, even if the river flows on

Traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Motion Descriptions in Relation to the Wadi’s Course

flat land. In Jbāli, the opposite action of ‘going downstream’ is sāḥ/ysīḥand
ṭabb/yṭobb. The former is not used in any spatial sense in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ,
while the latter is in use in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ as well as in other Negev Arabic
varieties to mean ‘to reach a place,’ ‘to fall down’ (Shawārbah 2012: 436),60 and
is never related to the wadi’s course.
In order to check for the potential existence of motion verbs related to the
wadi’s course, I showed my informants a series of short video clips that showed
amanmovingindifferentdirectionsinrelationtoawadi.Thesewerenecessary
to show the directions of the movement of the man and of the wadi’s course.
Thewaterflowstowardtherightof thescreen.Thesametwoscenes,‘mangoing
upstream’ and ‘man going downstream,’ were shown against the background of
a wadi twice, once on flat land and once on the slope of a small waterfall. An
additional scene represented the man walking away from the wadi. Some rep-
resentative examples of the results elicited are shown in Figure 41.
As shown in Figure 41, traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ does not use special motion verbs
that encode the direction of walking in relation to the wadi stream, as Jbāli
does. In aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, the verbs used along the wadi’s course are the same as those
usedformotiononotherlandmarksandgrounds,withtheadditionof thespec-
ification maʿ (ṭūl) al-wādī ‘along the wadi.’
Indeed, in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, the inherent parts of the wadi or its direction
are not directly grammaticalized as projective referents. Aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders prefer
to use the inherent parts of the wadi as spatial regions in topological relation-
ships, as exemplified in Figure 38 and as can be seen in the examples shown
in Figure 43. Examples 1 and 2 shown in Figure 40 are exceptions that present
the use of rās and āḫir as projective prepositions. These examples prove that
speakers of languages that use absolute frames of reference, as traditional aṣ-
Ṣāniʿ does, have the facility and the propensity to use an absolute matrix with
anchors of different types, local or astronomical. In fact, in the spontaneous
language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders, it is rare to find projective uses of rās and āḫir.
Figure 43 shows two further prepositional strategies, F min G jāy and F
min G ġādi, used in Jbāli in relation to the wadi flow. Literally, jāy and ġādi
mean ‘coming towards the observer’ and ‘away from the observer,’ respec-
tively.
In aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, these two prepositions are used according to a slightly different
syntactic construction, F min G w-ğāy and F min G w-ġād. The conjunction w-

According to Shawārbah (2012: 436), the verb also means ‘to drop’ and ‘to ride a horse.’ I
have actually heard the verb ṭabb once meant ‘to tame a horse.’

Deictic Uses of ğāy and ġād in Traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic
‘and’ appears in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ before the adveb. In traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, these
two prepositional strategies are used only in a deictic way, i.e., in relation to the
perspective of the observer, as in Figure 42.
The deictic use of this prepositional doublet is known also in Jbāli, but dif-
ferently from traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, in Jbāli this prepositional pair can also be
used in combination with the geocentric anchor of the wadi’s course. Thus,
F min G jāy means ‘F is toward the wadi end in relation to G,’ while F min G
ġadi means ‘F is toward the wadi source in relation to G,’ as if the perspective
of the observer is always anchored toward the wadi’s end. Actually, this usage
may derive from the fact that the Jbāli live at the bottom of the valley of Saint
Catherine’s wadi, downstream in relation to the source, so the default perspec-
tive of the observers coincides with the area of the river mouth, or with the
‘downstream’ direction, as exemplified in Figure 43.
In the case of this prepositional doublet, we do not know whether their use
is geomorphic or even absolute since the author (Nishio 1996) did not indicate
the territorial extensions for which these prepositional uses are valid.

Semantics of Astronomical Directions: Within Negev Landscapes
and Beyond
As demonstrated in the previous paragraphs, in particular those dedicated to
the spatial partition of the tent and its social and ethical connotations, in tra-
ditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ culture the astronomical directions are very salient, since they
are characterized by ethical, aesthetic, and social values that provide order and
meaning to the Bedouin experience of the desert worldand what existsbeyond
it, in both mundane and eschatological terms. The customary use of the car-
dinal directions and their very special uses were probably the most evident
aspects of the traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ system of space, at least to my eyes as aWest-
ern investigator.
The vision of the world as a four-cornered rectangular field made up of four
quadrants is already found in ancient Sumerian. The Sumerian ub-da4 is vari-
ously translated as ‘four corners’ or ‘four quarters,’as in the title ‘king of the four
quarters.’ In the center of the earth is a mountain, kur, probably the city of Nip-
pur and the e-kur, the ‘mountain-house,’ whence Enlil, called ‘Great Mountain,’
kur-gal, rules his human subjects. Four rivers were thought to surround the
world.Fourwindsembodythedynamicinfluencesof thefourcornersandtheir
values. In particular, the eastern wind is called ‘the mountain wind’ (im)kur-
re because of the fixed landmark-based association of the mountains with the
eastern direction. The northern wind is called (im)si-sa2, ‘the straight/proper
wind,’ while the western wind is (im)mar-tu, i.e., ‘the Amurru wind,’ related to
the name of the West Semitic population.
The north wind is a satisfying wind; the south wind is harmful (?) to
man.
The east wind is a rain-bearing wind; the west wind is greater than those
who live there.
The east wind is a wind of prosperity, the friend of Naram-Suen.

On the late Babylonian ‘map of the world’ tablet, the main continent is sur-
rounded by id2-marratu, the ocean, interestingly written with the id2 determi-
native for ‘river.’ (Horowitz 1990: 20–42).
In Assyrian texts, the winds are associated with four main deities:
The South wind: Ea, father of the gods.
The East wind: Enlil, lord of all.61
61
The word ‘all,’ Akkadian gimru, is also glossed as šaru ‘wind’ (Livingstone 1986: 76).

chapter 4
The North wind: Ninlil, lady of breezes.
The West wind: Anu, father of the gods62.
livingstone 1986
Among the Negev Bedouin, both šarg ‘east’ and ġarb ‘west’ are action nouns
(of faʿl pattern), while šimāl/šamāl and ğinūb/ğanūb follow nominal patterns
(Cerqueglini and Henkin 2016). In both Bedouin and sedentary neighboring
dialects (Meron and Kabha 1994), the participial form of stem ii
(mfaʿʿil) is used for ‘east’ and ‘west,’ not for north and south. In the Bedouin
dialect of the Syrian Jazirah, the directions are jibla ‘south,’ mġarrib ‘west,’
mšarrig ‘east,’ and šimāl ‘north’ (Bettini 2006). Rwala uses both forms, min šerž
and min mšarrež (Musil 1928). East is the direction of pre-Islamic sun worship
in the Near East. In Hebrew, the term for east, mizraḥ, is derived (in the pat-
tern of a place name, *maC1C2aC3> miC1C2aC3) from the root z.r.ḥ., denoting
the rising of the sun and moon. The same link exists in Negev Arabic, where
the verb ašragat aš-šams ‘the sun rose’ is clearly associated with šarg ‘east.’ The
east, thus, absorbs the positive connotations of the sunrise, symbolizing light,
new birth, hope, and luck (Bar-Zvi et al. 1998: 21). The west, in contrast, is tra-
ditionally associated with the death of the sun (aġrabat aš-šams) and death
in general. According to Brown (1983), nonetheless, the predominance of the
solar axis, and in particular of the rising point, can be considered a universal
bias found consistently across cultures.
During my stay among my informants, it took me a long time to get used to
theirwayof indicatingroaddirections,arranginglivingspaces,movinginspace
without paths, and indicating directions during narrations. One day, for exam-
ple, Hāğir had gone to visit a family of friends, who had settled on aṣ-Ṣāniʿ lands
with their permission and whose children her daughter Amal, who now lives
in Canada, had helped educate. By that time, years ago, Amal was leading the
project of a nomadic library, in which books were brought and loaned to pupils
who needed them and could not afford to buy them. Amal and I had accom-
panied Hāğir on that occasion. She was sitting on the concrete floor of the
shack, surrounded by women and many children of every age, sipping strong,
warm tea, and telling a family story to entertain the women and strengthen
their common roots through shared memories. In the course of the narration,
Hāğir recalled that her father had walked away leaving a group of people in the
village behind him. But, strangely for me, as she uttered these very words, she

The association of ‘west’ with Anu, heaven’s depth, is difficult to explain, as the west is the
place of the sunset, usually associated with ki-uraš, the Netherworld (Livingstone 1986:
74).

did not point behind her back. While saying the word warah, ‘behind his back,’
she pointed to the west. So, I asked, hū ġarrab? ‘Did he go westward?’ She nod-
ded. The direction in which he left the village was encoded in Hāğir’s memory
togetherwiththefactthatthevillagehadremainedbehindhim.Thespatialref-
erences in these memories were very complex, and included the intrinsic and
absolute frames of reference, one expressed in language, the other in gestures.
There is one more reason, I think, why the direction of the village in rela-
tion to the departing father was encoded in such detail in this engaging mul-
tisensory narrative. In genral, in Bedouin narrative, the direction in which
one departs from the village is the eastern one, toward which the tents are
open and exit is possible. Accordingly, the village remains behind, in the west.
Through these constant and recursivespatial references,everyone’sexperience
is inscribed in the cultural cosmos and becomes a collective and ritualized his-
tory. Connected to the place of the rising of the sun, šurūq in classical Arabic,63
the east is the beginning, spatially and temporally, of all adventures and under-
takings.
Here are some examples:
ḥaṭṭbāb aš-šarg fi-wijhih wmadd
‘He put the gate of the east in his face and set out;’
From Henkin 2008–present. Reported in cerqueglini and henkin 2016: 196
ḥaṭṭib-wujho aš-šarg ušarrag
‘He put in his face the east and went east.’
rosenhouse 1984: 206
The east also brings with it favorable omens and a wish for life, prosperity, and
social inclusion. Many passages of the Hebrew Bible also attest to the connec-
tion between the eastern direction and God’s presence and power, the origin of
humankind, and its primeval connection to spiritual principles.The horizon of
messianic expectations in Late Antiquity merged with the Christian tradition
in which Jesus’s character is associated with the principle of solar light, born in
the east, hence the Latin Christian expression ex oriente lux, ‘the light comes
from the east.’64 The following examples illustrate this point:

erogatory prostrations in the early morning’ (Kurpershoek 2005: 159).

protect this eastern entrance;

Then he led me to the gate, the gate facing east. And behold, the glory of

In contrast, the west, wherever it is, is the land of exile, migration, trespass-
ing, and, finally, social and physical death. This connotation is already found in
Sumerian omen texts such as this one:
If someone’s door opens to the south—his heart will be happy.65
If someone’s door opens to the north—his income will be abundant.
If someone’s door opens to the east—wherever he goes […]
If someone’s door opens to the west—death will be determined for him.

6 There was a man sent from God whose name was John. 7 He came as a witness to tes-
tify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. 8 He himself was not the
light; he came only as a witness to the light. 9 The true light that gives light to everyone
was coming into the world.’

The status of the south is ambivalent in the Sumerian culture; the southern wind is evil,
but the direction is not always negative.

In a Sumerian incantation text, the four winds have demonic characters, as
in this passage from the Utukku Lemnutu series, Tablet 12, verses 24–27:
The south wind, when it blows, dizzies people with dust.
The north wind when mightily blowing splits open the broad land.
The east wind, which has caused the rain above to rain down its light-
ning, makes a man’s body waste away.
The west wind is evil, tirelessly brings devastation to the arallû-plains.
In the Bedouin culture, east and west are the two opposite poles of human
experience. They are spaces, but at the same time they are also the extreme
sides of the physical, conceptual, and emotional world. In the following pro-
verb, ġarb and šarg are used as opposites, meaning emotional distance and
proximity, respectively:
ġarrib sanah wala tšarrig yōm
‘Go west for a whole year, do not go east for even a day.’
From Henkin 2008–present. Reported in cerqueglini and henkin 2016
The two most opposite directions in which two people can separate are east
and west:
allī ġarrab ġarrab wallī šarrag šarrag
‘He who has gone west has gone west and he who has gone east has gone
east.’
cerqueglini 2011–present. Maʿānīy, Kseyfih 2019
The most interesting example from the Hebrew Bible of east and west being
used together as extremes appears in Psalm 103: 12: ‘As far as the east is from
the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.’
Precisely because they are two extremes, east and west originally repre-
sentedthetotalityof humanandsuperhumanexperience.Whenusedtogether,
they mean ‘everywhere,’ as in following examples:

chapter 4
In the following passage, from the traditional Poem of ʿAlī bin Minʿim, recited
by the late Negev rhymer Ibrāhīm Abū Ṣyām, an honest girl warns the protag-
onist that she will resist his attempt to seduce her. In doing so, the girl uses the
metaphor of a city protected on all sides.The concept of ‘each side,’ ‘all around’
is expressed by the eastern gate and the western gate.
ʿa-bābna aš-šargī sabʿin wilabʿi w-ʿa-bābna al-ġarbī ʿabīd ar-Rašāydih
‘Oureasterngatehasalionandlioness,andourwesterngatehasRašāydih
slave guards.’
henkin 2010: 83
The same senses of ‘everywhere’ and ‘in the opposite directions’ are embodied
in sedentary Arabic varieties by the terms for right and left, as in the classical
Arabic mityāmnin mityāsir ‘to the right and to the left,’ ‘everywhere’ (Kurper-
shoek 2005: 539).
The south and the north separated from the east and west, respectively, at
a later time, as developments of the cardinal east (front)/west (back) axis by
the addition of a right (south)/left (north) extension. An indissoluble seman-
tic link binds the development of the cardinal directions to the parts of the
body, uniting in a semantic continuum of representations centered on man
and the world (Comrie 2003: 51–58). There are many traces of this in ancient
wisdom:
During the rainy season the spirits and even Allâh himself prefer to dwell
near the southern mountain, which the Arabs call aš-šerḳ, as it is sup-
posed to be situated in the inner desert. In the summer, however, Allâh
moves with all the spirits to the northern mountain, yeġarrebow.
musil 1928: 675
In Musil’s passage, aš-šerḳ, the Rwala dialectal parallel of Negev aš-šarg, ‘the
east,’ is associated with the southern mountains in the inner desert, while
yeġarrebow, ‘they go west,’ is associated with the action of going toward the
northern mountains. The association of the east with the inner desert conno-
tates this direction as the ideal homeland and the cultural focal space or the
mythical/mystical origin of all Bedouins.
The symbolic and metaphoric dichotomy between the positive east and
the negative west is reflected in the secondary axis, the north/south axis. The
denominations of north and south are derived in Bedouin Arabic from local
landmarks that represent the extremes of the culturally significant space, not
from astral positions. Terms for ‘north’ are derived from two roots: on the one

hand, š.m.l. (shared with ‘left’), and, on the other hand, š.ʾ.m, both associ-
ated with negativity. The term šām appears in Barthélemy (1935), connected to
mašʾūm ‘de mauvaise augure, sinistre, malencontreux,’ and carrying the neg-
ative symbolic values of šimāl ‘left’ (Taine-Cheikh 1991). ‘South’ is expressed
by y.m.n., linked to ‘right,’ ‘good fortune,’ and Yemen (Arabia Felix ‘prosperous
Arabia’), and by ğ.n.b., connected to ğanb ‘side’66 and ağnabī ‘foreigner,’ yet
without the negative connotations found in ġ.r.b. ‘strange, alien, west.’ In Negev
Arabic, as in many Arabic dialects, ‘west’ ġarb shares its root with ‘stranger,
outsider, alien’ ġirīb. Note also ġrāb al-bēn ‘crow of parting,’ a crow that omi-
nously announces the parting of lovers (Kurpershoek 1995; Shawārbah 2012).
Alʿatāmīn (2011) reports the negative expression uġrub ʿin wijhī! ‘Get away from
my face!,’ ‘Get out of my sight!’67 Sinai tradition prizes poetry from the east and
the south, in contrast to the west:
šiʿr aš-šarg gaṭfin min zahar
šiʿr al-gibla nagšin min ḥajar
šiʿr al-ġarb fattin min baʿar
‘Poetry from the east is like a bouquet of flowers.
Poetry from the south is like carvings in stone.
Poetry from the west is like crumbs of camel dung.’
bailey 2004
In Negev Arabic, ‘south’ is designated by giblih, the direction of prayer, while
ğanūb is restricted to elevated registers of the language (Cerqueglini and Hen-
kin 2016).
The southern region of the north/south axis derives from the east and the
northern pole derives from the west: south is positive, like east, with which it
fused in the original linear model, and north is negative, like west, which the
linearmodelincludedonitswesternside,associatedwith‘strangeness’and‘for-
eignness.’ Moreover, ğinūb ‘south’ is related to the concept of foreignness in the
word ağnab/ī ‘foreigner,’ yet without the negative, sinister, connotations found
inġarīb/ġirīb‘stranger,’whichthereforeexpressesthemeaningsof ‘strange,dif-
ferent, alien.’
66
As in Neo-Aramaic dialects, where it appears in diverse phonological variants (Mutzafi
2014: 212), the preposition ğanb alternates in Arabic varieties with other nouns for spatial
regions that indicate the generic relation ‘beside,’ such as ğāl ‘side, bank’ and ṣafḥah ‘side,
slope.’
67
The verb ʿrb means ‘to vanish’ in the Hebrew and Aramaic of the Old Testament (Fohrer
et al. 1973: 212).

chapter 4
According to Kurpershoek (2005: 41), Central Arabian ajnibi expresses the
concept of ‘belonging to a different tribe,’ and ajnibiyah is a girl from a differ-
ent tribe with whom one is not supposed to fall in love. Thus, the root j.n.b.
expresses the ‘foreignness’ included within the Bedouin world of relations, as
in the classical Arabic jānib ‘remote in kin.’ J.n.b. expresses the neutral con-
notation of distance in the Bedouin social world, without external negative
implications: janab is a troop of cavalry that stays with the herds if the pas-
tures are more than twenty kilometers from the camp and returns only after
sunset, while jnibah is a small herd of camels that has been led to graze in a
distant pasture. The basic meaning of janab in Central Arabia is ‘to go with the
camel herds to a distant place’ and ‘to take to a distant place.’ Jannab means
‘to leave somebody undisturbed,’ ‘to shy away from somebody,’ and istajnab ‘to
lead a horse alongside the riding camel.’ Jānib and janāb mean ‘side,’ like Negev
Arabic ğanb, or even ‘face’ and ‘honor’ (Kurpershoek 2005: 42). It is interesting
howMiddleEgyptianḏnb,probablyderivedfromArabic(Borg2021:113),means
‘todeflect’(Faulkner1962:322).InSabaicgnbmeans‘tobeonthesideof’(Biella
1982: 73). In Negev Arabic, as in many other dialects of the region, south is des-
ignated by giblih, the direction of prayer, while ğanūb is restricted in the Negev
to the elevated language of the literate (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2016).
Interestingly, the southern direction contains the concepts of both neutral
distance and closeness in the root g.b.l., with agbal meaning ‘to approach,’ and
tgabbal ‘to stand face to face.’ The southern direction also retains the concept
of inclusivity with the Bedouin world expressed by the eastern direction; for
example, in Musil (1928: 301) ežeblow, the perfect form of the third person plu-
ral dialectal reflex of g.b.l., is explained as ‘to move toward the Bedouin land,
to get closer.’ Furthermore, both the roots for ‘south’ in ğanāb ‘side’ and ‘face,’
gibal ‘frontpart’(Kurpershoek2005:259),andgiblih,thedirectionof theprayer
toward Mecca, entail the concept of ‘facing,’ which is ancestrally related to
the east, called pani ‘face’ in Akkadian.68 When one faces east, his right side
yamīn becomes associated with Yamān, at the southernmost edge of Arabia,
and his left side, šimāl becomes associated with its homonym ‘north.’69 In turn,
68
Compare Hebrew pānīm ‘face,’ li-fney ‘in front of,’ lifnōt ‘to turn to.’

The exception to this systematic arrangement of cardinal points is the Ancient Egyptian
view, where the principal direction is south, towards the source of the Nile, so that every-
thing is turned ninety degrees: south is face, in-front-of; north is back, behind; west is to
one’s right; and east is to one’s left (Wyatt 2001: 35–41; tables 42–50), e.g., m jȝbt jr jmnt
‘from the east to the west’ (Werning 2012: 327), with the word for west jmnt a cognate of
Arabic y.m.n. ‘right/south’ (Müller 2012). This Egyptian cosmology also implies that the
southern direction is associated with the temporal domain of the past and the northern
direction with the future (Macdonald 2013).

Yemen is associated with the positive connotations of the prosperous Arabia
Felix and with the appellative maymūn ‘lucky.’ Hence, the conceptual conti-
nuity between south and east is widely supported (Cerqueglini and Henkin
2018). The association of the south with the right hand/side seems to myste-
riously echo a deep insight regarding the connection between the right hemi-
sphere of the brain and the indefinite nature of the southern direction. The
south is an elusive space, where opposites attract and cancel each other out;
it is at the same time the Bedouin homeland and the borderland, the center
and the outer side. The root ğ.n.b., used to describe the south and its blurred
contours, is also present in sedentary Palestinian varieties in the meaning of
‘to doze off,’ ğannab,70 outside the realm of rational consciousness. The psy-
chic and metaphysical values contained in the semantic sphere of ‘south’ are
also found in the temporal domain in ‘noon,’ associated with the south among
Mediterranean cultures (il meridione ‘the south,’ from Latin *medi-dies> meri-
dies ‘noon.’ Compare also: il Mezzogiorno d’Italia ‘southern Italy,’ le Midi ‘south-
ern France’). Noon is the hour of the god Pan among the Greeks: at noon, all
things are united with their shadows. Since shadows are not projected, it is
impossible to distinguish any cardinal direction. At noon, Pan and the nymphs
revealed themselves to men, in the sunlight or in dreams. In heat waves it was,
in fact, recommended to rest and not engage in outdoor activities in order
not to be victims of unfortunate encounters (Caillois 1937). Centuries later, the
ominous power of noon is averted by the sound of the bells across Christian
countries, while the Prophet Muhammad forbade his followers to start a prayer
at noon because the infidels worshipped the sun at that time (Westermarck
1935).
While the south is associated with the qiblah, the facing direction during the
prayer, and east is the default, ancestral, facing direction, west, on the other
hand, has some implications that connect it with the back region, as in the
western, rear part of the tent. Furthermore, among the Bedouins of Central
Arabia, Kurpershoek reports the word ġārib, ‘shoulder blade, nape,’ related to
the same form that means ‘withers, part between the hump and the neck’ in
classical Arabic (2005: 239).
As mentioned above, west is associated with death as opposite to life, and
with the humid land as a symbol of contamination, opposite to the purity of
the desert dryness. An example of continuity between humidity and death is
seen in sedentary Palestinian Arabic aṯ-ṯūrah, which means both ‘black/humid

Many proverbs have been composed about the cultivation of dates in relation
totheyearlycourseof certainvisiblestars.Interestingly,fromastylisticpointof
view, the quality of the dates in the period of each star is described in terms of
effects of shining and brightness, establishing a symbolic connection between
the stars and the fruit:

‘Under the Pleiades, the branch is heavy; under Aldebaran the date gets
light; under Betelgeuse it shines; under Sirius you can harvest.’
bailey 1994: 73
The number of proverbs collected and those few reported here for the Negev
and Sinai have interesting parallels in the proverbs of Bedouin and sedentary
cultures all over the Arabian Peninsula, up to its southernmost offshoots. The
collections of proverbs, almanacs, and related data found in Al-Ghanim and
Watson (2020), Conti Rossini (1946), de Landberg (1901; 1920–1942, vol. 2), Fer-
rand (1928), Glaser (1885), Hommel (1891), Lane (1968), Owen (1933), Ryckmans
(1942), Serjeant (1954), attest to the ancient use of sidereal, seasonal calen-
dars in pre-Islamic Arabia and to its survival in the customs, folklore, and the
activities of traditional Arab and Modern South Arabic-speaking communities.
This ancient knowledge was also often assimilated into the writings of Muslim
astronomers (Varisco 1989, 1991, 1997).
Landmarks, regions, and cardinal directions are often associated with one
another, and their symbolic values may merge or overlap (Macfarlane 2015).

As in other cultures of the Middle East, for the Negev Bedouins the dryness
of the desert, their southeastern homeland is a symbol of primeval purity but
it expresses an aspect of indomitability and harshness that symbolizes the
Bedouin nature, yet condemns the Bedouin to a difficult life:
awwalxarābal-badūtimḥaliblādhumū-ṯānīxarābal-badūtigillar-raḥāyil
‘What most destroys Bedouin is when drought hits their land. Then they
are ruined as their herds contract;’
bailey 1994: 28
awwal šatāt al-badū al-maḥal
‘The main cause of Bedouin dispersion is drought.’
bailey 1994: 29
The second problem after drought seems to be the villagers
šawāna d-dahar w-aġla ʿalēna l-ḥaźīr az-zād
‘Scorched by drought and villagers who raised the price of our staples.’
kurpershoek 1994: 39
Drought and thirst drive people and animals mad, as the following proverbs
remind:

‘Drought will drive you even toward your foe;’

Because rain is such a huge concern, the Bedouin often pray to God in order to
obtain it:
ya-llah b-lēlin ma yixuffih nisam l-anwād
‘God give us a night whose clouds are not dispersed by the winds.’

chapter 4
Both the dryness of the east/desert and the humidity of the west/foreign
country contain paradoxically positive and negative values: the desert is pure
but harsh, the irrigated land is contaminated but fertile and irrigated.72 In the
following proverb, Sinai Bedouins simultaneously express the extreme differ-
ence that separates their desert environment from the irrigated, green land-
scapes of the Arab countries of the north, as well as the love that binds the
Bedouins to the desert, which in their eyes is as beautiful as Syria, a northern,
irrigated, urban country:
kull al-bilād ʿend ahalha šām
‘All lands are Šām in the eyes of their people.’
bailey 1994: 16
The ‘Šām of the Negev’ is Širīʿih, the land where the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ grazed their herds
toward Gaza, on the northwestern fringes of the Negev, an area rich in wadis,
soothed by humidity and the sea breeze, and particularly fertile and suitable
for agriculture:
yōm-ma ysīr ribīʿ an-nās bīšammlū (…) bīšammlū al-bil l-aš-širīʿih,
bīrabbʿūha, f-aš-širīʿih hāḏī
‘When spring comes the people go north … the camels go north to Širīʿih
spend the spring there, in this Širīʿih.’
From Henkin 2008–present. Reported in cerqueglini and henkin 2016: 197
As mentioned, in general, the west/north is connected to all aspects and val-
ues opposite to those connected to the cosmic order of life; both non-Bedouin
lands and the sea are external, non-functional, and therefore non-salient, parts
of the world. The Mediterranean Sea, west of the Bedouin land, is thus a place
of death and loss. In the Bedouin culture, water has negative implications both
as ‘contamination’ and as the salty, sterile, and treacherous sea, opposite to the
surface of the earth. Furthermore, the disruptive and chaotic force of water
is manifested in the desert landscape in sudden torrential rains that endanger
men, animals, and crops when they touch the dry, compacted earth of the wadi
beds at the end of the dry season:
uʿgub maṭar wa la-tuʿgub xaṣāb
‘Sow after drought, but not after plenty;’
bailey 1994: 70

Similarly, water and rain have both positive and negative values.

‘But among us some specific times for prayer are known from the stars,
we have a star for the prayer, and we know among us that her time is the
time of the rain, do you know? Among us, the time, we know from the

south, it rises in the south, we say: this is Suhayl for the stream, meaning:
avoid camping in the wadis, or in the flat in which there is a stream, that’s
it, we prepare for the rain, you see?’
MmṢ_F1948_Lig/May2013
Canopus, called Suhayl in Arabic, is associated with the southern direction,
where it appears in mid-October just before daybreak. Interestingly, accord-
ing to the linear, bipartite conception of the world, the southern rising point of
Canopus fuses with the eastern direction, further supporting the derivation of
the secondary axis from primary east/west directions:
binī ʿammna šarg al-ʾurdin maṭlaʿ nijūm ishayl
‘Our paternal cousins in East Jordan where the Canopus star rise.’
cerqueglini and henkin 2016: 191
Its appearance is a seasonal indicator that heralds the end of the summer and
the beginning of the rainy season. Canopus rises so low on the horizon that it
sets just some two hours later. This apparent behavior of the star has led the
Bedouin to associate it with the quality of inconstancy or the attitude of some-
one who wants to hide. Therefore they say:

chapter 4
Filān zay nijm as-suhayl: yiṭlaʿ wi-yiʿāwid ʿ-aḏ-ḏayl
‘So-and-so is like Canopus: rises and immediately returns on his tail.’
bailey 1974: 583
Canopus is one of the characters of a pre-Islamic myth, together with the four
stars of the Plough (the Big Dipper), called banāt an-naʿš ‘the daughter of the
bier.’ According to the myth, the four daughters bring their father’s funeral bier,
running after the one who was accused of murdering him, seeking revenge.
But they mistakenly run after Canopus, while the actual killer was Polaris,
the Northern Star. The myth is the symbol of unjust revenge and the story of
those who are forced to flee by running away from revenge for a crime they
did not commit. While Canopus, due to its apparent ‘inconstancy,’ seems to be
the culprit, Polaris, in its constancy, seems to be innocent. About Polaris it is
said:
illī qatal al-Jidī, w-it-tahīm suhayl
‘While Polaris is the killer, you put Canopus to flight.’
bailey 1974: 584
The Northern Star, for its stable and constant character, is praised in poetry,
representing the positive character of the northern direction:
ġāb an-nijm was-suhayl, wal-jidī mā ġāb
‘The Pleiades disappear as Canopus too, but Polaris never sinks in the sky.’
bailey 1974: 583
Yet the north also contains both positive and negative connotations. Concep-
tually derived from the western sphere and linked with its negative meanings,
both words for ‘north’ are generally associated with negative emotionality. In
Barthélemy(1935),šāmappearstogetherwithmašʾūm‘demauvaiseaugure,sin-
istre, malencontreux,’ and absorbs the negative symbolic values of ‘left’ (Taine-
Cheikh 1991), as does šimāl ‘left.’ Kurpershoek (2005: 169) relates šām with the
root š.w.m., interestingly producing the verb šām, ‘to soar to (moral or phys-
ical) heights.’ The connection of the north with the upper part of the world
is quite a complex concept, adopted by Western seafarers in relatively recent
times, after they abandoned the custom of putting the east at the top of the
maps. The origin of the association of the north with the upper region is gener-
ally thought to have derived from the conventions of map drawing and reading.

the northern direction and the position of the Northern Star, set in the upper
part of the celestial cap visible from the northern hemisphere.
Due to the elongated, narrow shape of the territory of the State of Israel,
the north/south cardinal axis has become more prominent than the east/west
axis in the contemporary daily life of the Bedouins. Indeed, after the end of the
nomadic era, with the creation of the borders of Israel, northern Israel became
the ‘new west’ for the men, as they came from the Negev to look for work on
farms or in building and infrastructure construction companies.
Within the Negev itself, many cultural differences run along the north/south
axis: the arid southern spaces are considered the home of the more conserva-
tive tribes, while the northern population is more modernized as a result of
contact with urban populations. The contrasting vision of a modern, yet cor-
rupted, north, and a primitive, yet authentic, south, emerges in the following
passage from a Negev poem. A delegation of men from a southern tribe arrive
at a tent of the Wuḥaydāt to receive a meagre welcome. It is said in the poem
that the vain owner of the tent was looking at his mirror and shaving his face
anddidnotofferthemthecustomarycoffee.Onthecontrary,thecoffeepotwas
upturned on the fire and the fire, in contempt of traditional customs. And he
taunted them as ‘southern people’:

‘He said: You folk from the south,
Hang around us far too much.’

chapter 4
In the following example, a Ḏ̣ ullām member of the northern branch de-
scribes a prominent difference in lifestyle between the northern and southern
Negev tribes: the different vessels used to carry water, clay jars in the northern
Negev, known also as the Beer-Sheva region or the Gaza region (before Beer-
Sheva was founded), and waterskins in the south:
blēdna hēḏi b-dīrit Ġazzih hēḏi blēd jrārī (…) wiblēd al-giblih hēḏgrab (…)
as-sabaʿ ugaḏ̣āh jrār
‘Our land in the territory of Gaza is a land of clay jars … and the area of
the south is water skins … Beer-Sheva and its zone are [in a zone of] jars.’
alʿatāmīn 2011/2: 102
In sum, ‘going north,’ in the language of the Bedouin elders, across tribal vari-
eties, still reflects some of the implications found in the traditional concept of
‘going west,’ i.e., going toward non-arid regions and a sedentary lifestyle, which
is exemplified in the following Rwala texts:
nabġi nuġarreb ʿala-n-nuḳra
‘we want to move to the settlers of an-Nuḳra;’
musil 1928: 167
w-en ġarrabaw ‘and if they go to the settled country.’
musil 1928: 210
While ġ.r.b. means ‘to go to the settled land,’ or ‘to go abroad,’ Rwala dialectal
reflexes of š.r.q. mean the opposite, i.e., ‘to move toward the Bedouin land,’ ‘to
go to the inner desert’:
yešarrežun ‘they dwell in the interior of the desert;’
musil 1928: 45
en šarraḳaw ‘if they come to the inner desert.’
musil 1928: 210
The use of cardinal directions, with their implications and multiple geographi-
cal, social, and symbolic references, is absent among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ young people,
who prefer to mention the proper names of regions and cities as spatial indi-
cations and references.

Cardinal Directions across Grammatical Categories
In traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, as well as in other traditional Negev varieties,
cardinal directions are grammaticalized across different grammatical cate-
gories, yielding adverbs, adjectives, prepositions, and direction-encoding verbs
of motion, as reported in Table 2.
While šarg ‘east’ and ġarb ‘west’ are names of actions of the faʿl type, mean-
ing ‘rising’ and ‘setting’ of the sun, respectively, the different names attributed
to ‘north’ and ‘south’ are secondarily derived from actual locations. It is very
significant that while the names for ‘east’ and ‘west’ are always anchored on
the astronomical reference of the sun’s daily course, the names for ‘north’ and
‘south’ primarily refer to places, Damascus and Mecca, respectively, located to
the north and south in relation to someone facing east from the Levant or the
northern Arabian Peninsula, while they would be wrong with respect to any
otherposition.Indeed,Damascusisnorthof theLevantandtheArabianPenin-
sula but not of Morocco or Iraq. The same can be said for giblih, ‘south,’ whose
primarymeaningisrelatedtothedirectionof Mecca.Meccaissouthof theLev-
ant and the Northern Arabian Peninsula but not of Yemen, Morocco, or Iraq.
The origin of the basic cardinal direction system in Negev Arabic, also found
in Classical Arabic, is thus the Levant and/or the northern and central Arabian
Peninsula, north of Mecca. The fact that ‘north’ and ‘south’ are referred to by
different names is indicative of their secondary character.
In Negev Arabic, the bare nouns of the cardinal directions can also be used
as adverbs, as alternatives to the combination min + cardinal direction noun,
as in the following examples:
hū wāgif šarg, mwağğih ʿalīna ‘he is standing to the east, looking toward
us,’
taʿāly wḫallī ṭ-ṭrambīl min ġarb ‘come (f.), and let (f.) the car toward the
west.’

chapter 4
In general, the min compound indicates a less precise spatial relation than
the simple cardinal direction, meaning a larger area and a less detailed con-
nection with the position of the speaker or of the rest of the spatial elements
in the scene. The cardinal adjectives are regularly derived from nouns through
the addition of the nisbah ending.
Intraditionalaṣ-ṢāniʿArabic,thebarenounsof cardinaldirectionsalsowork
as prepositions, both alone and in combination with the preposition min. In
combination with cardinal directions, as well as with other prepositions, min
can work as prepositional head or as part of a prepositional chain (min chain),
as in the following examples:
az-zalamih ġarb aš-šağarah ‘the man is west of the tree,’
az-zalamih min ġarb aš-šağarah, lit. ‘the man is from the west of the
tree,’ i.e., ‘the man is toward the west of the tree,’
az-zalamih min aš-šağarah w-ġarb, lit. ‘the man is from the tree and
west,’ i.e., ‘the man is west of the tree.’
Chapter 7 is devoted to the experimental distinction of the actual differences
in the meaning of each of these strategies.
In poetic and other literary texts, another forms arises: šarāg ‘east of,’ as in
following verse:
u bētih šarāg al-Mašabbih
‘His tent is east of Mašabbih.’
borg 2009: 90
AccordingtoBlanc(1970),inḎ̣ ullāmArabic,cardinalprepositionswereformed
by adding the stressed final morpheme -ī at the end of the noun, e.g., šargíy.
These forms have never been detected in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic. In gen-
eral, verbs follow the redoubled patterns, either the second or the fifth form.
This is not always the case for varieties outside the Negev, as explained below.

Polyframing of Cardinal References

vernaculars spoken by traditionally nomadic communities across the Middle
East and North Africa, along the periphery of the sedentary linguistic contin-

uum of the Arabic sprachraum. Nonetheless, it is a theoretically significant fact
that, when systematically examined from the perspective of semantic catego-
rization, despite this broad ambit of commonalities in the nomadic dialects,
the Bedouin Arabic vernaculars display a notable degree of internal differenti-
ation in the way they encode the dimension of space and time.
This overall picture, emerging from a comparison of Bedouin Arabic with
Classical Arabic and with the sedentary Arabic continuum, supports the view
that,allowingforminorresidualtracesof interdialectalcontact,thecontempo-
rary Arabic linguistic continuum displaysa sharp dichotomybetweennomadic
and sedentary varieties that is plausibly attributable to different living condi-
tions determined by ecosystems, which in turn act as cultural factors that ulti-
mately influence semantic categorization. Bedouin Arabic vernaculars would
therefore seem to provide the linguistic field scholar with a human observa-
tory that enables the study of the nomadic Weltanschauung and the cultural
evolution of the inner world.

Table 3, which reports the lexical transformations of the names of the cardinal
directions, generally used as prepositions and adverbs.
In general, the four basic nouns present in Negev Arabic and Classical Ara-
bic are available throughout the Arabic linguistic space, yet interestingly, other
local words are chosen to indicate the same four directions. These sometimes
reflect the original Arabian terms having lost their original anchoring, e.g.,
gǝbla still designates ‘west’ in Mauritania, as in the Najd, yet Mecca is obviously
east of Mauritania, not west of it. Sometimes new names are derived from the
position of local landmarks, e.g., baḥr for ‘north’ in Libya and Tunis, and niğd
for ‘north’ in Yemen.73 Blau (2006: 31) notes the Iraqi jihat al-baḥr, ‘the direc-
tion of the sea.’74 In other cases, the cardinal direction terms are conflated with
73
Interestingly, as cardinal directions and winds are strictly connected, in the Ethiopic Book
of Enoch there are twelve ‘gates’ (directions) of the daily and seasonal course of the sun
and twelve ‘gates’ of the rose of winds, which encircle the horizon. Here, the north wind
is called bāḥr ‘sea,’ associated with its counterpart libā, the southerly wind, probably from
the Greek λίψ/ λίβος ‘rain wind’ or λυβικός ‘Lybian,’ (from which the Italian libeccio ‘south
wind’ also derives). This wind was also called netug, perhaps from the Greek νότος, the
southern wind (Neugebauer and Black 1981: 24).
74
The southern wind, the stormy wind that comes from the sea, was already considered
mighty and ominous in the ancient myth of Adapa (Izre’el 2001).

aṣ-ṣāniʿ space and time: a linguistic and cultural overview
205
The expressive richness related to cardinal directions, in abstract terms, as
inherited from common Central Arabian Arabic and resulting from adapta-
tion to local landscapes, is so striking and broad that in certain cases different
lexical materials are used to express the same direction across different gram-
matical categories. Thus, for example, in the Najd, while ʿilwa ‘high’ is ‘south,’
sannad ‘to go uphill’ designates the southern course. Traces of the association
of slopes with cardinal directions are found in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, in
sannad ‘going uphill,’ also used to mean ‘going east,’ as in:
sannad ʿa-l-ḫalīl (lit. ‘he went (up) to Hebron’), i.e. ‘he went (east) to
Hebron.’
This use of sannad, which some tend to explain by pointing to the fact that
cities are depicted in Middle Eastern imagery as set on hilltops, is in fact
explained by the fixed association of mountains and the eastern direction as
experienced from the Negev, as I found in my experiments and explain in chap-
ters 5, 6, 7, and 8. Indeed, ‘going to Gaza’ or ‘going to Beer-Sheva’ are never
expressed by sannad. In particular, ‘going to Gaza’ has a specific verb derived
from the name of the city, taġazza. In fact, as Gaza is found along the coast,
lower than the Negev’s high plains, hawwad ‘to descend’ is also used to indicate
the path to the city:75
hawwad ʿa-ġazzih (lit. ‘he descended to Gaza’), i.e. ‘he went to Gaza.’
ḪlṢ_F1948_Lig/Apr2013
And of course, the most-used verb in association with the western/downhill
course toward the Mediterranean coast is t(a)/ġarrab, ‘to go west,’ as in:
ġarrab ʿa-ġazzih ‘he went west to Gaza.’
SrṢ_F1948_Lig/Jul2014
Furthermore, the eastern course is described in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic
by sannad only when the slope actually rises in the eastern direction, actu-
ally toward the northeast from the Negev’s regional core. Otherwise, the verb
t(a)/šarrag is used:
75
Insteadof hawwad,theverbtarağ‘todescend,’isfrequentlyused. Hawwad,tarağ,andsan-
nad are never used to express movement along the geometrical vertical axis (e.g., moving
along a tree trunk or a pole), only in association with movement along a natural slope.

Encoding the direction is not compulsory in Negev Arabic varieties, so it always
possible to use direction-neutral verbs of motion instead of verbs that encode
directions:
baṭrig ʿa-wādī al-ḫalīl, batgabbil ʿādil ʿādil
‘I go toward wadi al-Ḫalīl, then I go south straight, straight.’
MḥṢ_F1948_Lig/May2015
Another expression of the effects of polyframing in traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ is the
fixed association of the abstract wadi direction with the north/south axis. I will
return to this fixed pattern in chapter 8.
Table 4 reportsthe lexical options found tolexicalizethe direction-encoding
verbs of motion across several Arabic varieties. Interestingly, distant varieties
of Bedouin Arabic, such as Negev varieties, Najdi Arabic, andTunisian Marāzīg,
retained the same secondary value of ġarrab, ‘to expatriate.’ Semantic facts
such as this one point at the existence of a common ancestral Bedouin lin-
guistic milieu in which cardinal directions were already developed and con-
ceptualized as polysemic, complex cultural ideas. The transformative process
that leads to the variation of lexical sources and framing strategies for cardinal
directions across Arabic dialects has been labeled ‘polyframing’ (Cerqueglini
and Henkin 2016). Polyframing is a special kind of polysemy that entails the
possibility for a preposition or adverb to be understood according to differ-
ent kinds of frames of reference, astronomical and geocentric, and to alternate
between them.

aṣ-ṣāniʿ space and time: a linguistic and cultural overview
207
Prepositions for ‘above’ and ‘below,’ ‘front’ and ‘back,’ ‘right’ and ‘left,’ ‘far’
and ‘near’ were used in the past to encode both their basic meanings within
the intrinsic frame of reference. Cardinal directions, within geocentric strate-
gies, are just some examples of what is meant here by polyframing.
The opposite is also possible, i.e., cardinal directions may be used to indicate
non-geocentric spatial representations, as in the Rwala tšārīž, which means
‘path to the inner desert,’ or the traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ taġarrab, ‘going abroad,’
or the Rwala ežbal, ‘to come closer’ (dialectal reflex from agbal), no matter in
which actual direction.
The mixing of geomorphology and cardinal references in the fixed associa-
tion between slope inclinations and astronomical directions is very interesting
within the varieties of the Arabian Peninsula. Ingham (2002) reports:
In connection with long-distance travelling a conceptual system obtains
which is linked with the yearly Bedouin migration cycle and in Central
and Eastern Arabia is grounded in the topography of the area which
slopes gradually down to the Euphrates valley.
ingham 2002: 300
According to Ingham, in the dialect of the Ḏ̣ afīr and Āl-Murrah tribes, where
the verb ḏahaba, ‘to go,’ comes to mean ‘to go to the sea,’ the eastern migration
toward the Euphrates each summer is a descent (the verb ḥadara ‘to descend,’
is used; the country is called ḥadr ‘down-country’), while the winterly course is
associated with an ascent (sannad ‘to ascend,’ is used, the region is called ʿilwah
‘up-country’).The south is ğiblah, which also means the up-country toward the
Ḥijāz.
The conceptual system derived from this geographic situation links the
meaning of the verb taḥaddar ‘to descend’ with the northeastern direction of
the summerly migration, and its opposite, sannad ‘to ascend,’ with the wintery
course back southwest to the Arabian territories. Hence, the preposition ḥadr
‘down,’ is used to designate ‘north,’ and fōg ‘up,’ is used to designate ‘south.’
Ingham also mentions Musil’s observations on Rwala Arabic speakers, who
use šarrag ‘to go east,’ and ġarrab ‘to go west’ as general terms for ‘to go into
the desert grazing ground in autumn’ and ‘to go to the settled lands in sum-
mer,’ no matter the actual geographical direction, i.e., whether they were going
toward Syria or Iraq (Musil 1928: 219, 237). Consistently with the data reported
by Ingham, Kurpershoek (1994: 426) reports the verb taʿalwa ‘to climb, ascend
a mount’ and the corresponding noun, ʿilwah as ‘the west, the direction of the
Ḥijāz muntains as seen from wādi ad-Dawāsīr.’ All of this emphasizes once
again that not all roots secondarily associated with cardinal directions are sys-

tematically exploited across grammatical categories. Sannad ‘to go uphill’ is
alsoused,butitisassociatedmorewith‘totravelin[a]south-westerlydirection’
(Kurpershoek 2005: 392). Ḥadar ‘to go down’ is used to designate movement in
the opposite, northeasterly direction (Kurpershoek 2005: 351). Musil notes the
term mḥādīr ‘lower ends of a sloping country’ (Musil 1928: 182).
The use of the local landscapes for the grammatical coding of spatial rela-
tions is a constant across Arabic dialects, adapted to different territories in the
presence of different local landmarks to which cardinal directions and other
coordinates are often anchored (Behnstedt et al. 2011; Cerqueglini and Henkin
2016). A further example of grammatical coding of altitude and direction in a
Bedouin language is represented by the spatial linguistic representations of the
Jbāli tribe in St. Catherine’s wadi in Sinai, as reported by Nishio (1992; 1996), as
mentioned above. In the Jbāli dialect, the direction of the wadi, also connected
to the difference in height and slope direction, determines a complex system of
coded spatial references that also includes categories of parallel or perpendic-
ular alignment both between the objects to be spatially located and the stream
and between the objects of the scene in relation to the position of the wadi,
which is constantly and implicitly included in spatial calculations. The asso-
ciation of geomorphological slopes and fixed directions found among eastern
Bedouin varieties is similar to the system discovered in Tenejapa by Brown and
Levinson (1992). Slope directions are not always precisely coincidental with
astronomical quadrants. Thus, Ingham reports (2002: 301) that among the Āl-
Murrah, the Jidi, or Pole Star, is used as a directional term when one wants to
refer to the astronomical north, and for the south, shēl, Suhayl, Canopus, which
rises in the south, is used.
Socin (1900: 313–315) also notes that ‘Die Angaben auf die Himmelsrichtun-
gen waren nicht immer kompassmäßig,’ therefore there was a need for more
precise directions anchored in astronomical references and local wind direc-
tions: hēfi ‘the direction of Suhayl;’ nasri ‘the direction of Jedi;’genūb ‘the direc-
tion between šarg and hēfi;’ jāhūm ‘the wind of north-west;’ jedi ‘the wind of
north-east;’ naʾši ‘the wind of south-east;’ nisnās ‘west wind;’ naʿšī ‘the south-
east wind;’ and nakbāʾ ‘the southern wind.’
The presence of slope-oriented cardinal axes and astronomical axes within
the same linguistic systems proves something already identified by C. Brown
(1983) and by Ozanne-Rivierre in her studies on Austronesian orientation sys-
tems (1987), namely the ability of speakers of geocentric-framing languages
to shift freely and competently between astronomically-anchored, absolute,
landmark-based, and geomorphic strategies.This ability is the cognitiveengine
that drives the semantic shifts in cardinal reference names between celestial
bodies, the sun’s course, winds, slopes, landmarks, and artifacts.

aṣ-ṣāniʿ space and time: a linguistic and cultural overview
209
Even today, I am able detect even in my cognitive linguistics classes that
young native Arabic-speakers from different Bedouin and non-Bedouin back-
grounds use geocentric referential styles very often in basic conversations, say-
ing things such as:
F is toward the door/wall/window in relation to G.
Yet the linguistic competence on more abstract geocentric orientation is lost,
as shown below.
The complex conceptualization of cardinal direction polyframing also in-
cludes switching between cardinal and landmark-based anchoring strategies,
triggering semantic changes, so a sun-based absolute cardinal direction can
acquire a local-based relative meaning. In certain rural Egyptian varieties,
miġirrēb (from ġarb ‘west’) and miširrēg (from šarg ‘east’) have come to mean
not only ‘towards the west’ and ‘towards the east,’ respectively but also ‘to the
district town’ and ‘to the village center.’
On the other hand, human artifacts, such as cities, or large-scale landmarks
such as the sea or a mountain chain may come to designate astronomical direc-
tions. This metonymical process, however, pertains mainly to the secondary
axis terms ‘north’ and ‘south’ in relation to the orientation of their habitual
stationary horizon. Dialectal reflexes of qiblah, literally, ‘front’ and actually des-
ignating the direction of Mecca, are used to mean ‘south’ in dialects used north
of Mecca, in both nomadic and sedentary groups (Behnstedt et al. 2011). In
Egyptian, traditional urban Tunisian, and Libyan dialects, baḥr ‘sea’ designates
the north; in western Yemeni urban dialects, ʾadan, the direction of the city of
Aden, is generalized to indicate south (Behnstedt et al. 2011).
It is interesting to note that in Africa, outside the original Damascus/Yemen
axis that provides the lexical sources for ‘north’ and ‘south’ in the Arabian focal
area, the south remains designated by the term giblah and its etymological
reflexes, while the north is referred to by other designations, such as baḥr ‘sea’
and ḏ̣ahr ‘back.’ Other interesting observations on the different frequency of
use of cardinal directions in the Negev, related to their primacy or secondary
saliency, can be found in Cerqueglini and Henkin (2016).

The Traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Horizons
The traditional tribal space of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ in their nomadic history, until 1948,
was organized around the east/west axis, or high/low or mountain/sea axis,
along which spaces and movements coincided with winter and summer activ-
ities, as seen among the Rwala and other Central Arabian tribes, according to a
fixed cycle of significant and culturally organized spaces and times.Thus, a net-
work of meanings was created in which each spatial term was full of temporal
and social implications. Once this spatial–temporal–cultural link was broken
by modernity, words gradually lost their implications and the semantic fields
gradually narrowed.
As Cerqueglini and Henkin (2016) have demonstrated, across Bedouin cul-
tures the east/west axis and the verbs of movement related to it seem basic,
while the north/south axis and its verbs seem to have been derived from the
east/west, probably later, when the bipartite vision of the world had become
more complex and the horizon had been divided into four quadrants. Kurper-
shoek (1994) notes that in the verbs ‘to go east’ and ‘to go west,’ the stem ii is
used, while for the other two directions, the stem iv is used: ašmal ‘to travel
north;’ ajnab ‘to travel in a southerly direction.’
The verb šarrag ‘to go east,’ was used in taa in the nomadic period to indi-
cate the winter migration towards the eastern mountains, whose pastures were
irrigated by seasonal rains. The path towards the sea, towards the west, coin-
cided with the descent towards the coast at the beginning of summer, when
the inland territories became too arid, and humans and flocks needed temper-
atures mitigated by the sea breeze and more humid pastures. This summerly
coursewasindicatedby ġarrab,whichintaameansboth‘togowest,’and‘togo
tothesea,’fromthesamerootasġarb‘west.’Thesamepathtowardthesouthern
Levantine coast was indicated in taa by the verb taġazzah ‘to go to Gaza,’ from
the local name of the city Ġazeh, and by the verb hawwad ‘to descend,’ since to
go from east to west corresponds to a descent from the eastern mountains to
the western coast in the Negev landscape, as mentioned above in Section 13.
The opposite path is expressed by sannad ‘to go uphill,’ also used in taa as
a synonym of ‘to go east.’ Among taa speakers, it is not unusual to hear the
expression sannad ʿa-l-Ḫalīl, ‘to ascend to the city of Hebron.’ Hebron is in the
Palestinian Authority, in the mountainous area east of Ligīyih and the Israeli-
Palestinian border. After the signing of the Oslo Accords and the closure of
access to the Gaza Strip and the city of Gaza from the Israeli side, the Bedouins
of the Negev lost access to a very important and popular Arabic-speaking com-
mercialcenterandleisurearea.GazawasthenreplacedbyHebron,although,as

that of Gaza in richness and variety of goods and the skills of its craftsmen,
especially the furniture makers and goldsmiths, whose services were required
by Negev Bedouin families for weddings and the construction of new homes.
In 2013, when I conducted my most intensive fieldwork campaign, Ligīyih
had 10,824 inhabitants.76 In 2019, the number had risen to 14,074.77The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
tribe includes probably less than one thousand people, but no precise census is
available. Some young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ live in Beer-Sheva, some abroad.Within the city
of Ligīyih, the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ reside in the northern neighborhood, where they have
built a mosque and manage a middle school, which is attended by members of
the family and its affiliates. In general, in the recognized villages, it is common
to find that mosques and schools are managed by the family that resides in the
neighborhood. All other state infrastructures, such as state medical services,
serve the local inhabitants and the people from the unrecognized villages.
After the end of the Military Law in 1966 and the return of portions of tribal
lands for the purpose of building the recognized settlements, several Bedouin
groups found themselves outside the territorial enclave where the seven recog-
nized villages were planned and have since lived scattered around the Negev, in
encampments of shacks, without water pipes, paved streets, drinking water, or
drains, far from schools and hospitals and exposed to the risk of flash flooding
during the winter season.
The close link between slope and direction observable in taa vacillates
among maa speakers, who are very uncertain in their recognition and use of
taa path-encoding verbs, and it eventually disappears in yaa. As mentioned
above, the ancestral semantic association linking ġarb ‘west’/ġarrab ‘to go
west’ with ‘to go toward the cultivated land’ and, by analogy, ‘to go outside
the Bedouin homeland’ and, in the modern world, ‘to go abroad,’ is substituted
in yaa, as in general across young varieties of Negev Arabic (Cerqueglini and
Henkin2016),byšammal,‘togonorth,’nowadaysusedtomean‘togoabroad’or
‘to emigrate.’ The semantic association has probably been restructured based
on the shape of the modern Israeli state, which stretches from north to south.
Compared to the Negev, the central and northern regions of Israel seem more
promising in terms of economic opportunities and employment, therefore
these are the more common destinations of Bedouin emigrants.Today’s hiğrah
‘migration’ thus occurs along the north/south axis, while the ancient ruḥūl
‘travels’ in the southern Levant took usually place along the east/west axis.

Indeed,theconvenientandrapidmeansof transportinusetodayhaveledto
a decrease in attention to the topographical characteristics encountered along
the way, which include temperature, altitude, and slope. Today, once one gets
out of the village, the national road network is followed. There is no need to
choose a route based on its characteristics in each season and for different pur-
poses. Once, altitude and slope were essential components of journeys, and
therefore they were codified in the taa language.
Certainly, the nomadism of the southern Levant is dissimilar in many re-
spects—ecological, cultural, and linguistic—to the nomadic experience of the
Bedouin tribes familiar with the sandy deserts of the Arabian Peninsula or the
emptiness of the African Sahara. For example, the symbiotic relationship of
the Āl-Murrah with the desert and the practice of crossing its most inaccessi-
ble and arid areas is revealed by Āl-Murrah linguistic coding in motion verbs
of the directions of travel, parallel or perpendicular in relation to the direction
of a line of dunes or hills. According to Ingham (2002: 301), the Āl-Murrah verb
ʿāraḏ̣ means ‘go at right angles to a wadi, road, or line of hills,’ while bāra means
‘to go parallel’ to the same objects. In relation to dunes, daʿam means to travel
through them from the direction of the steep edge, while adraj means to travel
through them from the direction of the long, windward edge. In Marāzīg (Boris
1958), gōṭar means ‘to march aligned in a row,’ as caravans progress,78 šōgar
means ‘to deviate from the direction of the march,’ while sraṭmeans its oppo-
site, ‘to maintain straight direction,’ and, finally, šabba means ‘to maintain the
direction of the march toward the given astronomic reference.’
The search for these and similar meanings among taa speakers has pro-
duced no results. In general, crossing any type of geographical area or entity
perpendicularly is gaṭaʿ, meaning ‘to cut,’ that is, crossing a certain area, gen-
erally to shorten the way. ‘Proceeding parallel to something’ is maša maʿ ‘to go
with’withtwo-dimensionalobjectssuchasthewadiandtheroad.Inthecaseof
athree-dimensionalobject,suchasamountainchain,thesameconceptcanbe
expressed by ʿabar min ‘to pass by.’ However, as I show in this book, in the cog-
nitive and linguistic bedrock of taa speakers, perpendicularity and parallelism
between objects in static and motion scenes, what I call here ‘alignment,’ is of
great relevance and is carefully detailed by means of alternative prepositional
strategies.
78
In Traditional Negev Arabic, the verb is used with the basic meaning of ‘to reach a place’
and ‘to follow traces.’ It is often interpreted in popular folk etymology as a reanalyzed loan
from the English utterance ‘go there!’ In Jbāli, the same verb means ‘to go away’ (Nishio

aṣ-ṣāniʿ space and time: a linguistic and cultural overview
213
It is possible that the linguistic coding of experiences related to the cross-
ing of desert spaces disappeared from taa when long-distance travel became
much less frequent. But this cannot be proven. Nonetheless, even in a more
restricted space, such as the northern fringes of the southern Levantine steppe,
taa too has maintained fundamental ancestral structures (probably stretch-
ing back to a pan-Bedouin phase), such as grammatical distinctions between
parallel and perpendicular alignments of objects in space, which are lexically
encoded in Rwala.
The seasonal nomadism of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ was characterized by fixed patterns
of migration over relatively short distances, with a few adventurous journeys
usually heading to Sinai. One of the most important confirmations of the deep,
long-lasting, relationship with the local territory is the persistence and cogni-
tive salience of the structure of the Negev landscapes, intimately connected to
the cardinal directions and their symbolism, and to altitude and slope varia-
tions, as I show in detail in chapter 8, also devoted to the effects of the local
landscape on spatial cognition across different generations.
Here, I would like to introduce the topic of the importance of the local
landscape’s configuration in the spatial representations of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders.
I recall the first time I understood that the local landscape was known in such
detail by the elders that they were able to recognize each slope of a mountain
and the actual, cardinal orientation of different parts of the landscape por-
trayed in pictures, not only within the Negev but also across Sinai and Jordan,
where they used to travel.79

background panorama was taken from a place in Jordan, somewhere close to
Wadi Ram, during one of my visits to the Bedouin groups there. The pictures
were shown on the computer screen. On this occasion, contrary to my expec-

the actual orientation of the portrayed panorama as shown in Figure 47.

Jordan is still accessible and often frequented by the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, who have family across the
border. They still visit relatives, share ceremonies, and attend family celebrations. Jordan
is the seat of one of the most important experiments I carried out on the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ concep-
tion of landscape elements across generations, as shown in chapter 8.

representations of real entities do not have the same semantic properties as
real, three-dimensional, entities, elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informants provided absolute
responses on the relative positions of two objects portrayed in pictures on the

thatthelineinthebackgroundwastheprofileof amountainbeforestartingthe
experiment, and the names of all objects portrayed or used in the experiments
were agreed upon ahead of the beginning of the test.
InFigure45, themountainisalwaysassociatedwiththeeasterndirection,so
the ball is seen by the informants as west of the tree, in the opposite direction
to the mountain. Having noticed the association of the stylized mountain with
the east, I asked my informants why they provided me this kind of response.
Three informants explained to me that the mountains are east of the Negev
and the traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ land, so they routinely associate the ‘abstract’ pic-
ture of a mountain with the Jordanian border, i.e., with the eastern direction,
by default. In so doing, the elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ speakers provide a local, landmark-
based anchoring for these types of stylized and artificial representations. The
treatment of the stylized mountain profile, which was always associated with
the eastern direction, is similar to the default treatment of the tent, automati-
cally thought of as opening toward the east, as seen above.
A similar situation is also observed when the wadi is in the background of
a spatial scene shown on the computer screen. In this case, too, regardless of
the semantic properties commonly associated in the spatial domain with the
specific entities shown in the scene and the referential strategies associated
with them, the wadi provides a geomorphic orientation field, with its source
always associated with the northern direction and downriver associated with
the southern direction, according to the direction of the Jordan drainage basin,
consistently with what is shown above. One of these experimental results is
shown in Figure 46.
In contrast to what has been observed so far, when real, known, famil-
iar landmarks and panoramas were set in the background of spatial scenes
shown on the computer screen, elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informants answered in abso-
lute terms, using the cardinal spatial field created by the actual orientation of
the landmarks and panoramas, independently of the type of fg entities shown
in the pictures and their position and alignment in relation to the informant’s
vision field.
The informant whose response is reported in Figure 47 explained, both in
the answer and in more detail to me later, that the visible flank of the moun-
tain is the northern one, therefore he could say that the ball was north of the
three, on the opposite side in relation to the mountain’s position. This picture
was indeed taken inWadi Ram, near Petra, and was recognized by the speakers.
This type of experiment, which introduces different types of background
representations together with the usual spatial scene, not only provides inter-
esting information on the use of different types of geocentric frames of ref-
erence among the elderly aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, but also highlights the strikingly different

contribute to both the comparative examination of spatial thought in various
cultures and the understanding of how ontological categorization, which is the
basis of semantic properties, works, especially within the debate on the impact
of nature on culture and language.
The use of salient landmarks of the tribal space as references for geocen-
tric orientation attests to an intimate relationship with the territory, cultur-
ally embedded and often ritualized, as in the case of the direction of Mecca,

Middle and Young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Generations Confronted with Desert

Duringmyfieldwork,aṣ-Ṣāniʿeldersalsodisplayeddetailedknowledgeof more
distanthorizons,outsidetheNegevtriballands,especiallytowardtheSinaiand
eastern Egypt, to which they were linked by tribal ties; Jordan in general; and
in particular Petra and Wadi Ram.
The cognitive richness and cultural salience embedded in the linguistic rep-
resentations provided by the elderly, who use a network of geocentric solutions
to describe space scenes in different spaces, is not present in subsequent gen-
erations. The loss of the system of cardinal directions in language has been
accompanied by progressive and rapid changes in lifestyle, among them the
abandonment of nomadism, decreased mobility in the desert territories, and a
profound alteration of their bond with the territory and its components.
The abandonment of nomadism is perhaps the most important of these
changes. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ practiced semi-nomadism over very short distances for
a long time and have continued to occupy part of the same territories. There-
fore, the change occurred more in the organization of the territory, now linked
toasedentaryandWesternmajoritycultureandnolongertoancestralBedouin
patterns. Their movements are now carried out quickly, by car or public trans-
port, often along trajectories paradoxically deviating from the shortest and
easiest path for a walk or a ride on horseback. One no longer crosses spaces
without marked paths.Thespatial referencesarecrossroads,trafficlights,gaso-

line pumps, motorway junctions, and stable settlements, not natural elements
with their shapes, orientations, and directions. With the creation of the Israeli
national borders, the horizons of mobility have also narrowed due to Israel’s
long conflictual relationship with the neighboring states.
Middle-agedandyoungaṣ-Ṣāniʿspeakersarenotascompetentastheelderly
speakers in describing landscapes in Jordan and Sinai. And even within the
Negev horizons, the picture is also quite different from that obtained from the
elders. In general, the profile of middle-aged speakers is that of people over the
age of fifty today, generally schooled either up to middle school, or, in some
cases, university. The profile of the intermediate age group varies greatly from
tribe to tribe, in correspondence with how the cultural transition was experi-
enced and the extent to which adults allowed the once young people, men and
women, to adapt to the new lifestyle.The generational gap in culture, language,
and cognition between the elderly and middle-aged aṣ-Ṣāniʿ is very marked,
because, living in the Negev, the intermediate generation has benefited from
contact with the Israeli Jewish urban world, no longer as seasonal workers in
kibbutzim, but as students and then teachers, doctors, politicians, journalists,
and intellectuals. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ seniors are proud of the freedom of action they
have granted to their children and the professional and personal success that
they have achieved in the new reality.
While in other Negev tribal groups, whose analysis remains beyond the
scope of the present work, the intermediate generation is very similar to that
of the elderly one in linguistic and cultural terms and even the young people
behave not dissimilarly from the elderly, among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, the speakers of
the middle-aged generation certainly show some transitional linguistic traits
(between the young and old generations), but these are often more similar to
those of the young than to those of the elderly.
Commonly,amongthemoreconservativetribes,intheintermediategenera-
tion, in whose customs and attitudes the cultural conflict withWestern models
and the recent radicalization of Islam are reflected, there is notable diversity in
orientationskillsandinthecodingof imagesbetweenmenandwomen,absent
even among seniors. In fact, in almost all the tribes, the elders of both genders
led very similar lives in the premodern past, were accustomed in equal mea-
sure to moving independently with the flocks through large spaces, and were
scarcely literate. This equality disappears with the intermediate generation, in
which in some tribes, with the change of customs, women are confined to the
home,oftenwithoutacar,receivelesseducationthanmen,andparticipateless
in social and political life. This is not the case with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.
Below are some examples of the same experiments presented so far with the
elderly generation, concerning the orientation of the wadi and the mountain

with different types of stimuli, performed on six middle-aged and six young
informants, three men and three women in each group. The number of infor-
mants was chosen to be equal to that of the elderly, i.e., homogeneous over
the three generations. The aim of this section of the survey is to compare the
data of the elderly presented so far with the responses of the other two gener-
ations.
First, regarding the subdivision of the parts of the geographic elements,
mountain and wadi, the lexicon contracts from the language of the elderly and
the middle-aged speakers.Young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ have replaced traditional names with
terms in common use or from sedentary Palestinian varieties, under the effect
and intellectual pressure of geographic models learned at school, as seen in
Table 5 below. For the meanings and the extensions given to the part terms by
the elderly, the references are in Figure 38, above.
The partitions of both mountain and wadis are different across aṣ-Ṣāniʿ gen-
erations, in terms of both part nouns and their extensions. Interestingly, the
middle generation recognizes the smallest number of parts for both mountain
and wadi, smaller than the young generation, in which people use terms bor-
rowed from sedentary Arabic varieties (qimmih ‘summit,’ nazlih ‘descent,’ ʿēn
‘source’), which are spoken by many of their teachers, mainly young people
whoteachintheNegevatthebeginningof theircareer,orfromstandardArabic
(ṭarīq‘way,’maṣdar ‘source,’munʿaṭaf ‘bend’).Incontrast,thetermsusedbythe
speakers of the middle-aged generation belong to the traditional lexicon, but
are less precise than the specific traditional geographic terminology, which has
been lost. In particular, human and animal body part terms are disappearing as
geographic denominations, with the exception of rās ‘head,’ which is still very
widespread in local sedentary varieties as well. Most of the morphological and
functional reasons for the traditional partition and denomination of mountain
and wadi parts are no longer understood or lexically codified.
As for the spatial treatment of the wadi, the intermediate generation shows
no particular effect of the wadi stream’s direction or inference with regard to
cardinal directions. In two cases out of six, speakers from the middle-age group
described the scene using the actual cardinal orientation of the experimental
setting. Another chose to refer to the relative distance of both F and G in Fig-
ure 48 in relation to his own position as observer. The young inferred a higher
position for the entity closer to the source of the wadi and a lower height for
the other one from the knowledge that water streams tend to follow an up–
down course. Figure 48 reports one example from each generation, the most
representative type elicited from each age group.
In Figure 48, I report some examples of responses elicited from the middle
and young generation in the experiments that included the administration of

tioned in the question ‘Where is F in relation to G?’, while the layout, the type
of stimuli and the experimental setting were not relevant to discriminating
between different types of referential strategies. In particular, the background
elements (mountain, wadi) were not considered as references or sources of
coordinate systems or associated with a fixed pattern, as they are among the
elders. Furthermore, among members of the middle-aged and young genera-
tions, two-dimensional representations of three-dimensional objects prove to
have the same semanticpropertiesasthecorrespondingrealobjectsinthespa-
tial domain.
Figure 49 reports the same experimental setting and conditions as shown
above for the elderly. Both objects of the spatial scene are shown on a neutral
background and the informants were requested to locate the ball in relation
to the tree. I report in Figure 49 some of the most representative and frequent
types of responses given among the six informants tested for each age group,
i.e., the middle-aged and the young groups.
The middle-aged group was far less homogeneous in its responses than the
young one, which was consistently oriented toward relative representations
by reflection expressed by the preposition giddām, ‘in front of.’ It is worth
recalling here that the elderly only use giddām within the intrinsic frame of
reference, with a closed group of faced, familiar, culturally salient objects. As
shown in Figure 49, the prepositional split based on the cultural spatial ontol-
ogyinuseamongtheeldersisnolongeravailabletothemiddle-agedandyoung
groups, which both use giddām with a symmetrical, unfaced, ground objects
(e.g., tree).
It is worth noting that some resistance to projecting giddām onto a sym-
metric object was observed among the middle-aged informants, where gabl
‘before’ (temporal) is used instead of giddām. Among the middle-aged popu-
lation, cardinal directions are still present, especially among the older or less
educated individuals within the age group, yet it is interesting to note that the
cardinal directions are used as directional adverbs, not fully grammaticalized
into prepositions, with their relational and referential value.
Figure 50 parallels Figure 45, showing the spatial scene on the background
of a stylized mountain. In this type of experiment, too, the middle-aged par-
ticipants responded in a more heterogeneous way than the young partici-
pants, applying the relative frame of reference by reflection in a much more
consistent manner. In both cases, the stylized background had no significant
effects. I report some of the most representative answers provided by the
informants. There was a large number of relative answers among the middle-
aged participants, and they differed remarkably from each another. The inter-
mediate generation also uses the relative frame of reference by reflection,

Moreover, the middle-aged participants shared a tendency to produce differ-

both deictic and intrinsic descriptions. I sensed that they felt that different
options were possible and shifted among them without distinguishing which
one was more appropriate. The young people seemed more assertive, as if just
one option was possible and there was not much to speculate about.

chapter 4
An interesting characteristic of the middle generation is the only adverbial
use of cardinal directions and sap-Landmark strategies, which are largely avail-
able as prepositions among the elders.
Another feature common to intermediate and young informants is the col-
lapse of the traditional spatial ontology and the semantic properties attributed
by the elderly to objects, both in terms of spatial dimensions and specific prop-
erties of species. This collapse is accompanied by the disappearance of body
partsusedforspatialregionsandprepositions,duetoaperhapsmoredetached
and less animated vision of the surrounding natural environment. Scientific
models of space measurement and perception are inevitably imposed by for-
mal learning among members of the younger generation. The intermediate
generation has lost the world vision of the elderly and not all of its members
have acquired the new tools of scientific world description and seem to rely
more on their referential knowledge.
The most interesting point here is the fact that landmarks, abstract or local,
do not influence the spatial representations of two-dimensional objects shown
on the computer to middle-aged and young people. Nonetheless, as we will see
below,locallandmarksinfluencethecognitionof thesegroups(chapter8).This
discrepancy is one of the aspects of the mismatch between language and spa-
tial cognition that has recently been revealed by researchers (Bohnemeyer et
al. 2022).

Sheva back in 1948, the year she was born and the year the last tribal council
took place. I visited her together with her 26-year-old nephew, whose name
is also Ibrāhīm. ŠēḫIbrāhīm, Maryam’s father, had studied law in Egypt and
Turkey, and his whole family enjoyed great authority in the Negev. The irre-
versible loss of the land was experienced as a personal defeat and a family
drama in addition to comprising a political earthquake that upset the bal-
ance of power and authority between the Negev tribes at the time. I met
Maryam at her house, north of the central mosque, in the aṭ-Ṭalālgih neigh-
borhood of Ligīyih, a few hundred meters west of the house of ʿAbdelraḥ-
mān. She told me the story of her father because all the strangers who had
come before me had asked to hear it. I actually wanted to do linguistic and
cognitive tests with my computer and small toys, and she looked surprised
and disappointed by my lack of interest in political issues, which she felt

were central to her identity and much more interesting than my elemen-
tary questions, which probably seemed below the dignity of her status and
age.
Nonetheless, when she arose from her mattress after having served me tea
and dates, she described to me the way in which the Bedouins once set the
hour of prayer at the central hours of the day in the absence of clocks. An entire
world opened up to me:

‘Ibrāhīm: When one prayed to the sunset, in the past, what did people
call the sunset time?
Maryam: We said, ‘the sun sets,’ ‘the sun rises.’ We used to pray and know
the time according to the sun. Here, I want to show you [rising from
the mattress]. Before the sun goes up, the dawn comes, the roost-
ers and hens crow, the rooster sings, we know the time. The rooster
knows like the clock on the wall, and when the sun sets, it becomes
red, when it becomes red, we know that it is evening, do you under-
stand? And we know from the stars, under this star we fast, under this
star we travel, we know this way, we know about the time from the
stars and from the daylight, do you understand? So, we stand like this,
here, I stand this way, and I want to pray, no rooster and no clock, ok?
The sun becomes like this [pointing perpendicularly over her head]

Maryam’s speech interestingly swings between the forms naʿrif and niʿraf, as this passage
shows.

here, it is now noon, we pray, you see? That’s it, and then comes the
time of the afternoon prayer, after the afternoon prayer, the sunset,
then it is night, that’s it, we know the night hours.
MmṢ_F1948_Lig/May2013
My first meeting with this elderly Negev woman was crucial for me in laying
the foundations of my cultural approach to the analysis of the linguistic and
cognitive spatial representations of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ. She explained to me that the
tent poles served as a sundial. Each point where the shadow of the poles was
projected corresponded to a specific hour of the day, assigned to some spe-
cific activity or prayer. At night, the course of the moon and stars served the
samepurpose.Accordingtotheseasons,theshadowmovedatdifferentspeeds,
but the relevant time was between sunrise and sunset. I realized that simple
human artifacts were once in absolute continuity with the wider cosmic sys-
tem, according to culturally organized relationships.
Indeed, the unchanging shape and orientation of the tent, always opened
toward the east, the fixed position of the poles, and the standard organization
of the space according to the cardinal directions, with the entrance toward
the east, made it possible to interpret the poles’ shadows in a consistent way
within Bedouin society and to calculate the correct times for meaningful activ-
ities.
Fāṭmih and Niʿmih added some further details during a conversation with
her son, Ibrāhīm, in another meeting, to explain Maryam’s words, accompany-
ing them with hands gestures:
Ibrāhīm: kīf kuntū w-intuw gabil al-waḏān, kīf kuntū taʿrfū al-wagt l-aṣ-

Niʿmih: One knew and everybody knew after him, namely I knew after
you, and also another knew after you.
Ibrāhīm: But how did one know the noon time and the evening time?
Fāṭmih: According to the shadow.
Ibrāhīm: According to the shadow?
Fāṭmih: Yes. The shadow turned first of all in this way [pointing to the
east and moving the hand toward the west], then in the other way
[moving the hand from west to east]. One prayed the sunset prayer
when the sun went down. The sunset prayer when the sun goes
down, and the morning prayer before the sun comes up, and the
noon prayer when the shadow moves so as to become like this [mov-
ing the hand perpendicularly to the ground], and then this way [mov-
ing the hand from west to east]. Yes, people did know, they did know.

Before sunrise and sunset there were signs that the sun was about to rise and
set, so that people could prepare for the sacred office of prayer.83 These are the
dawn, (the fağr, as explained by Maryam in the previous passage) before sun-
rise, and the twilight, ramās, after the sun has descended below the horizon.

by the atmosphere. From the same root as ramās, various words connected to
‘evening’ and ‘spending the evening time’ are found in Omani and Yemeni Ara-
bic dialects, in Syriac, and in the Old Egyptian mšrw ‘evening, evening meal.’
Borg suggests the root r.m.s. to be etymologically connected to the semanti-
cally close Arabic root s.m.r., with metathesis (Borg 2021: 172). The word ramās
is also of particular interest because of its morphological nature. It is a very old
Arabic infinitive form, of the faʿāl type, rare across Arabic varieties and strik-
inglyfoundamongtheNegevBedouins.ItbelongstotheancientSemiticstrata,
parallel to the Akkadian parās-u (Huehnergard 2011: 15).84
Letizia: ana baʿrif kilmih ramās.
Ibrāhīm: ēš ramās?
muʾaḏḏin reminds the faithful of the daily prayer duties at the correct times. One of the
most striking sights when entering a mosque is the niche of the qibla that faces to the
direction of Mecca and the many clocks all around it, telling the time in different parts of
the world. But in the desert, in the days of the nomadism, there were no mosques, and no
one called others to the prayer.
83
I wish to thank Muḥammad Alʿatāmīn for the information provided about the times of
prayer and for teaching me the word ramās.
84
I wish to thank Prof. Alexander Borg for these remarkable observations.

‘Letizia: I know the word ramās.
Ibrāhīm: What is ramās?
Maryam: The twilight time, when the earth turns dark, the time of the
darkness, the earth turns dark, the twilight falls.
Ibrāhīm: She looks for old words like the twilight’s fall.
Maryam: The twilight is when the earth turns dark, and why do we say,
‘the twilight fell’? Because everybody turns to himself, the woman
gathers her sons and daughters, feeds the children, tells stories, and
puts them to sleep. That’s it, and at night, nobody goes out except
if they have to go to a certain place, do you understand? So, that’s
it, the twilight falls, everybody gathers himself, namely it is forbid-
den to hang around, you see? The twilight fell. And we say: ‘the sun
rises’ and it is dawn, the dawn that comes before the sunrise, namely
before the sun comes up, the day sparkles a bit, we call it ‘dawn.’
MmṢ_F1948_Lig/May2013
The nocturnal hours also had great importance, above all in connection with
the nocturnal travels through the desert and for the observation of the stars,
to which the seasonal cycles were linked. In fact, the Bedouins had a sidereal
calendar to organize seasonal activities and a lunar calendar for the months’
division:

‘Letizia: And the moon?
Maryam: The moon, this is the moon: we count the Bedouin month
from the new moon’s day, and the day it starts growing, we call it
‘crescent,’ that’s it. This is at the beginning of night, but we count the
days. As we wanted to know the time of Ramaḍān, we got to know
according to the Bedouin or to the Muslim date, you see? Let’s have
a tea, oh grandmother,87 and after you know, you will do research
during the day and at night.
MmṢ_F1948_Lig/May2013
Maryam uses the Arabic term as a synonym for Bedouin, contrasting it with the
term ‘Muslim’ in reference to the calculation of time. The calculation of time is
evidently based on the observation of the stars among the Bedouins. badr, the
new moon, is the beginning of the month and is etymologically related to the
word badrī ‘early, early morning.’
Familiarity with the nocturnal desert landscapes and the absolute spatial
orientation has cultural implications in the pre-Islamic cult of the stars and
celestial bodies (Bailey 1982), forbidden in the Qurʾān. In particular, the impor-
tance of the solar deity seems to have left traces in apparently secular cultural
practices,suchasthepredominantsaliencyof theeast/westaxis(thedailypath
of the sun) in cardinal orientation, the construction of tents always opened
toward the east, the famous astronomical knowledge of the desert travelers,
and the widespread use of masculine personal names related to ancestral solar
cults.88
Nonetheless, speaking of the periods of time, while trying to elicit the kind
of metaphor (time-moving or ego-moving) according to which time is concep-
tualized among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders, I received from Maryam a response steeped
in Muslim wisdom and religious devotion:
87
Honorific affectionate appellation, using a kinship term in a reverse way in relation to our
relative age order.
88
Borg (2001) and Borg and Kressel (2001) claim that the Negev Arabic male personal names

The Seasons and the Activities Associated with Them
Bedouin cultures preserve a sidereal calendar based on the absolute anchoring
of seasonal changes to the cycles of certain relevant celestial bodies, especially
stars.The rise of Canopus is observed from the Arabian Peninsula and the Mid-
dle East on October 15. Yet, according to archives of weather reports, in the last
twenty years, mid-October nights over Sinai and the Negev have been hot and
dry,asacleareffectof recentglobalwarming.Inthelasttwelveyears,autumnal
rainfalls have begun only in mid-December.
A Bedouin proverb states:
al-burbārah limma tṣīr li-suhayl rišī, ʿišī wala hū ʿišī, awwal ar-rabīaʿ w-āxir
aš-štī
‘When Sirius hangs over Canopus like a pail rope, nightfall or just before,
it’s the beginning of spring and winter’s end.’
bailey 1994: 22
At the end of February, in the sky after nightfall, Sirius and Canopus are aligned
along the same meridian. The Bedouin considered this celestial array a sign of
the onset of the season of the spring pasture. Today, the end of February no
longer marks the end of winter. In the southern Levant, the Negev, Sinai, and
Jordan, cold days and strong rains last at least until the end of March. In today’s
Middle East, the winter starts two months later and ends one month later than
it did in the premodern period, just one century ago, as one can understand
from the references found in the proverbs. The winter is thus shorter and dis-
plays different characteristics than it did in the relatively recent past, when
these proverbs described actual circumstances. Consequently, the beginning
of the summer is no longer in May, as in this poem of the Dindān Bedouin, in
central Arabia:

‘I moan and groan like a herd of camels standing with bent necks, looking
over the brink of the well for more than three days. Their humps sagging,
gone whatever remained from grazing on the xazārif plants: and then,
on the fourth day, heard the shouts of the herdsmen. Once covered with
fat, they now look like shriveled thongs: cruel thirst robbed them of the
strength they gained from spring’s pastures. Like a bundle of dead acacia

wood they trudge along at the time of Canopus’ eclipse when the great
heat sets in.’
kurpershoek 1994: 39
The Pleiades and Canopus seem to be the most important temporal references
for date farming in the premodern Bedouin seasonal calendar, according to
which the activities and religious practices were organized:
aṯ-ṯurayya razan ig-ginī, imgaydiḥbahī, al-jōza zahī, al-burbāra jinni
‘Under the Pleiades, the branch is heavy;
under Aldebaran the date gets light;
under Betelgeuse it shines;
under Sirius you can harvest;’
bailey 1994: 73
aṯ-ṯurayya, ʿaddil ig-gnī ‘Under the Pleiades, let the branch lie flat,’
suhayl, šaḏ̣ḏ̣ ʿarī ‘Under Canopus, the loops are fastened,’
suhayl yixallī ar-ruṭab hayl ‘Canopus makes the ripe dates fall.’
bailey 1994: 74–75
My aṣ-Ṣāniʿ informants never mentioned to me that they had cultivated dates.
They possessed lands and pastures both toward the inland area, in Ligīyih, and
toward the sea, in the area of Širīʿih, close to Gaza. The ownership of these
enabled them to perform seasonal short-distance migrations between the two
locations and benefit from the most advantageous climate conditions in every
period of the year:

Maryam: No, but in the winter, people put their tents all close to one
another, like us, like here the house of Ḫālid Abū Manṣūr and those
households that are all plenty of people, but it was not like today,
this is Abū-ʿĀyiš and this is aṭ-Ṭalāg, they were all together […] If God

Fāṭmih explained to me how, at the beginning of the warm season, the beds
of the still-moist wadis were used to cultivate fresh vegetables. Tomatoes were
driedunderthesunandstoredforthewinter.Aspecial,richcheese,calledʿafīg,
was made in summer and quickly dried to facilitate transport. In winter, it was
grated and consumed with the addition of water.The summer period also coin-

the wool. In general, summer was also the time for weddings, and remains so
today.
I present here another section of the narration of Kāmilah al-ʿAmūr, men-
tioned in previous chapters. The narrator here explains that the Bedouins used
to keep the fields divided from one another by boundaries made of a kind of
onion that lasted tenaciously for at least two generations:

being sent to the area of the onions, on the field’s border, was perceived as a
removal from the community and considered a punishment:

Cardinal Directions, Seasons, and Weather: A Cross-Cultural Survey
on Naturalistic Metaphors from Arabia
The salience of natural forces is prominent among the Bedouins tribes that
originally inhabited the Arabian Peninsula and spread, with the Islamic expan-
sion, into Asia and Africa. In Arabia, the prayers for rain are central in the
Safaitic corpus:

‘O Bʿls1mn, send the winds with rain!’
al-jallad 2015: 146
The Quran emphasizes that the one true God, not the pre-Islamic gods, grants
different varieties of rain (maṭar, ġayṯ, wadq, wabil, ġadaq, tall, rajʿ).91 In tradi-
tional Bedouin formulaic language, poetry, narrative, and daily speech, expres-
sions related to weather phenomena, used to preserve the knowledge neces-
sary to survive in desert landscapes, are pervasive. As has been found in dis-
tant cultures (Palmer 2002), landscape elements, weather phenomena, and
cardinal directions often conflate into extended semantic networks, which
are among the main sources of the metaphorical transfer of values and emo-
tions:92

Bedouin cultures preserve a sidereal season calendar anchored in the cycles of
relevant celestial bodies, especially stars (Steele 2007):

‘When Sirius hangs over Canopus like a pail rope,
nightfall or just before,
it’s the beginning of spring and winter’s end.’
bailey 2004: 22
The association of sidereal bodies, cardinal directions, and weather phenom-
ena is used to construct symbols and metaphors that refer to collective ethical
and esthetic values and personal feelings. Also among the Najdi Bedouins, the
star Canopus, low in the southern horizon for a short period, brings violent
floods and is ominously associated with betrayal, inconstancy, and guilt:
ʿugb as-saham gid hi gidid al-manäsif mann ad-dma myāfha yam
zāni kanha hasim at-talk tamsi gifàgtf hazzat migib shēl wa-l-gēd dāni
‘Once covered with fat, they now look like shriveled thongs: cruel thirst
robbed them of the strength they gained from spring’s pastures. Like a
bundle of dead acacia wood they trudge along at the time of Canopus’
eclipse when the great heat sets in’.
kurpershoek 1994: 39
In all traditional Bedouin societies, naturalistic metaphors play an important
role in the communicative code, representing the adhesion of the speaker to
the common and communicable experiential heritage.93 Nature is a perva-
sive source of images to communicate messages that cannot or should not be
referred to directly:94
My fortune is like a flower thrown among thorns on a windy day.

In the poetry of ad-Dindān, the Duwāsīr bard recorded by Kerpershoek, tears
andpoetrybothseemtobeassociatedwithwaterstreaming,inthepositive,fer-
tilizing sense. The poet’s effort to put confused and violent feelings into verse
resembles a sacrifice that re-establishes a primeval cosmic order, similar to the
regular alternation between rainy and dry seasons:

chapter 4
‘From you I ask a night stretching from the east towards al-Ḥarrah,
heralded by flashes of lightning and rolling thunder as unmistakable
signs.’
kurpershoek 1994: 106–107
Rain seems to be a universal source of metaphors for life and psychic intensity,
as opposed to physical and emotional drought (Italian: uomo arido, lit. ‘arid
man,’ i.e., man without feelings). Nonetheless, the structure and the extension
of metaphorical networks centered on rain, winds, and other natural elements
areshapedbybothlandscape-basedandculture-specificconstraints.Evengeo-
graphically contiguous and culturally connected societies may select differ-
ent natural elements as metaphor sources and map different meanings onto
them.95 In southern Arabian, ‘water’ subdomains acquire different metaphoric
meanings in Najdi and Modern South Arabian poetry. In the poetic language of
the Mehri fasīh,96 water subdomains have both positive and negative value.97
The metaphor of drought as absence of poetry is made explicit in this Mehri
verses:
śmīmet enṭərōr teh bālī ksē
yšeṭṭem ḥarḳwe-ryīḥwe-lhēb
w-ḫeyr yemyōl law menh eysēr
wet nhā beh tetrūb be-bhēl
‘Would that God might give us rain in the canyon of Śmīmet Neṭrōr
It has struggled against the drought, the wind and fire for long enough.
Let goodness return, certainly it’s much better. While we are there,
words turned to dust.’
liebhaber 201898
The prayer for rain ( fiʾóse lǝ-mέsε) is also found in Soqotra:99 the rain, invoked
as the benevolent aspect of the divine, favors nature and animals and drives
away evil. Mahra poets more often associate dry winds with painful emotions,
while the humid southern winds from the sea, rather than rains, are invoked
for relief:

liebhaber 2018106
As in the Najd, in the Classical Arabic qaṣīda too, floods are not frequently
associated with battling troops.107 In the Najdi corpus, sudden and devastat-
ing raids are more often represented by metaphors of swarms of locusts and
clouds of dust (35 times) rather than metaphors of water floods (16 times). The
water cycle is of such crucial importance in the Najd that its mention in neg-
ative contexts may be considered ominous. This probably happens because in
the coastal Modern South Arabian homelands, drought is a less constant threat
and rainfall is heavier and more regular.
Finally, the sea is in wider use in the Mahra and Śḥέri than in the Najdi
metaphoric landscapes, often as a threat, as seen in the following two passages,
respectively:
ʿār ḫźeyr w-lō ʿāmūm we-shīb ḏ-īḳḳədūt le-mkawser we-nkəśūt

‘Lord, may my soul not be in troubles, in the green sea, when it closes the

These data show that in constructing metaphors, the cognitive experience of
landscape influences cultural interpretations and linguistic expressions. In the
Najdi and Modern South Arabian traditions, the mountain peak is seen as a
subdomain of the semantic network centered on rain, as it is cognitively con-
nectedtotheformationof clouds,i.e.,of poetryaspsychologicalrelief.Cardinal
directions associated with weather phenomena are also part of poetic net-
works, yet with different meanings: the southern wind, a metaphor for drought
in the Najd, represents the humid sea breeze in Modern South Arabian poetry.
Further micro-regional, community-based, cultural specificities related to the
origin, use, and symbolic implications of cardinal direction terms in the south-
ern part of the Arabian Peninsula are also present in coastal Yemeni Arabic
dialects (Prochazka 2009). Here, among the seamen of aš-Šiḥr, west is called
xūr, meaning ‘low-lying inlet covered with salt water’ (Serjeant 1980), or more
generally ‘golfe, baie, crique, fosse’ (Landberg 1920–1942: 658);109 south is zīb,110
etymologically associated with the stormy southern winds (azyab; Piamenta
1991) or to stormy winds in general (azyāb; Simeone Senelle 2002), regardless of
their provenance; a word for north is difficult to find: the northern direction is
associatedwiththewordkūs‘humidwindblowingfromthesouth,’yetthesame
term is also associated with the southern wind. Landscape-specific differences
are active in structuring metaphoric networks, alongside cultural contact, as
observed by Liebhaber111 between Modern South Arabian and Nabaṭī poetic
traditions. The experience of different landscapes restricts the transmigration
of poetic motifs in landscape-based metaphoric imagery.

Modern Times
The most evident fallout effect of the creation of national boundaries between
Israel, Jordan, and Egypt was the end of the nomadic life for all southern Lev-
antine Bedouin tribes (Kressel 1975). The days of the great migrations and the
long caravans had come to an end, and with them one of the most ancient and

well-preserved nomadic traditions of the Mediterranean (Borg 2019a, b). The
days of the Arabs might have continued within the Negev landscapes, where
the customary fights might have soon transformed into political and ideolog-
ical participation in the Palestinian resistance and land reclamation, bloody
family feuds for blood honor or for the control of smuggling, then engagement
with women’s emancipation, activism for political and economic rights, and
finally the struggle for integration, recognition, and resilience.
Often when I visited these Negev outsiders, especially scattered groups of
ʿAzāzmihandTarābīn,Iwasabletodrivethecartoacertainpointandwhenthe
path became too steep and stony I had to park and continue on foot for almost
a kilometer. Salām, my regular companion, who moved from Hebron to the
Negev as an Arabic teacher and social worker, always remembers these rough
walks with humor. Off-road vehicles are never lacking. The Bedouins have a
passion for cars, for travel, for driving around even without a precise destina-
tion. I was often taken by car towards no special place, just to go and take a look
at distant landscapes and try some difficult off-roads.The young men entertain
themselves by gathering and driving around in cars, also speeding through the
streets of Beer-Sheva, especially on Friday evenings, when the city empties and
the roads are deserted once again. Perhaps this behavior ritualizes the disap-
pearance of a socially useful task, i.e., the surveillance of the territories, once
entrustedtotheyoungpeopleortheannouncementof weddingpartiesnearby,
that the young men perform through traditional music broadcasted at full vol-
ume. Perhaps this apparently aimless roaming serves to symbolically restore
authority over the area, to make their presence felt, or merely to demonstrate
their youthful energy. When the cars disappear on the evening skyline and the
trails of music fade with the wind in the evening light, on one hand one real-
izes that everything is continuously changing in the Negev, while, on the other
there is a strong sense of the Bedouins’ persistent presence.
Certainly, everything is changing rapidly and irreversibly, as the cross-
generational linguistic changes clearly show and as in traditional societies
everywhere. Nonetheless, some unexpected things remain; very young people
point toward target places, sketch maps, and perform cognitive tests according
to the geocentric frame of reference, despite its absence from their linguistic
production.

chapter 5
The Intrinsic Frame of Reference across the
Generations
1
Preliminaries
As we saw in chapter 2, in the intrinsic frame of reference, the coordinate sys-
tem radiates from the Ground object, so ‘John is in front of the building’ means
that John, F, is to be found in the region projected from the inherent front part
of the building, G.The intrinsic frame of reference is classified as binary. In this
case, the notion ‘in front of’ is a binary relation whose arguments are Figure
and Ground; the projected angle is found by reference to an intrinsic or inher-
ent facet of the Ground object.
In order to become the center of the coordinate system, G must have some
clear ‘inherent’ functional or geometric asymmetry, in this case on the front/
back axis. A building is generally conceptualized as having an inherent front,
where the front door is located. This can be seen as its ‘face,’ whereas symmet-
rical objects, such as a ball/tree/stone/pole, are less eligible for the intrinsic
strategy, at least in most European languages, and are potentially more likely
to prime deictic (relative) or geocentric strategies.
The attribute ‘inherent,’ though widely used in the literature, is misleading.
Indeed, such facets are conceptually assigned by different languages according
to some algorithm, or learned on a case-by-case basis depending on the object,
or more often a combination of these. They basically rely on culturally variable
conventions. The procedure varies fundamentally across languages. For exam-
ple, in English it is largely functional, so that the front of a tv is the side we
attend to, while the front of a car is the facet that lies in the direction of motion,
and so on. But in some languages, such asTzeltal, it is much more closely based
on shape (Brown and Levinson 1993a: 46–70). Heine’s report (1989) that among
the Chamus (Eastern Nilotic), trees have an intrinsic front region according
to their inclination or their most prominent branch suggests that the concept
of inherency is sensitive to cultural variation, as is seen in Tongan languages,
where the ‘front’ region of the house is associated with the manifestation of
social power and authority and assigned according to the location in which
the chief sits (Bennardo 2000).
The language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ elders is rich in inherent armatures (systems of
facets) projected onto all kinds of objects of daily use or geographic landmarks

chapter 5
(a linguistic overview is provided in chapter 4). Body parts derive from human
and animal bodies, as seen in chapter 4: ‘the door of the vase,’ bāb al-ğarrah;
‘the head of the hill,’ rās al-gōz; ‘the belly of the mountain,’ baṭn al-biṭīn; ‘the
tail of the tent,’ ḏīl al-bīt, the lower edge of the posterior curtain of the tent; ‘the
hind legs of the tent,’ riğl al-bīt, each posterior external pillar of the tent; ‘the
face of the tent,’wiğh al-bīt; the entrance of the tent, ‘the face of the knife,’wiğh
al-ḫūṣah, the blade; ‘the back of the table,’ and ḏ̣ahr aṭ-ṭawlih, ‘the surface of
the table.’ Nevertheless, it should be emphasized that these body parts remain
confined within the ambit of topological relations and are never lexicalized as
projective relations, for which other prepositions are used. The only exception
is wiğh, ‘face,’ which can be used also projectively, in contrastive distribution
with giddām, min giddām, min G w-giddām, and gabl, as shown below.
Corpus-based analysis revealed that the use of traditional human- and ani-
mal-body-part nouns is significantly reduced and almost disappears in the
middle-aged and young varieties, as shown for natural landmarks in chap-
ter 4, and substituted by sedentary Palestinian, standard Arabic designations
or prepositions of a more abstract nature, such as ʿala ‘on,’ fi- ‘in,’ fōg ‘above/
over,’ ğuwwa ‘deep inside,’ ğanb/ʿa-ğanb/ fi-ğanb ‘beside,’ f-aṣ-ṣafḥih ‘on the
side,’ and f-al-garʿah ‘on the bottom.’ Min compounds are also used with sig-
nificantly less frequency and saliency in the younger generations (below, Sec-
tion 3).
This chapter shows the application of the intrinsic frame of reference and
the prepositions specific to it in the elderly, intermediate, and young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
generations. The aim of the experiments was to tackle the evolution of the
semantic parameters that rule the application of the intrinsic strategy. The
data presented here are based on the three generational groups of informants,
defined in chapter 3, ten female and ten male speakers each. For the sake of
conciseness, the language of the elder group is hitherto abbreviated as taa
(traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic), of the middle-aged group as maa (middle aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
Arabic), and of the young group as yaa (young aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic).
The protocols applied are interviewer/informant questions of the type
‘where is F in relation to G?’ with static and mobile spatial scenes; direc-
tor/matcher ‘Man and Tree’-type linguistic games; and tick tests with binary
options, all as they have been defined and described in chapter 3.
The fg spatial scenes were tested first in functionally (interactionally) neu-
tral (e.g., man/ stone; man/tree), functionally salient (man/horse; horse/grass;
man/man), and functionally non-salient combinations (horse/dog; dog/grass;
tree/stone) on the basis of the culture-specific methodology developed for the
elders (chapter 3) and kept constant across generations to enable compari-
son.

The Intrinsic Frame among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Elders
As shown in Cerqueglini (2017, 2018), and Cerqueglini and Henkin (2018), taa
uses the intrinsic frame of reference when one of a restricted set of entities
is selected as Ground in the spatial scene, through the prepositions wiğh, gid-
dām, min giddām, min G w-giddām, and gabl (for the front region) and wara,
min wara, min G w-wara (for the back region). These entities are familiar and
culturally salient (tent/knife/coffee pot), asymmetrical along the front/back
axis, mobile, and considered motor intelligent, i.e., able to find paths and
move according to a precise will and range (human being/horse/camel/don-
key/dog/all carnivorous animals and birds of prey).
2.1
The Front Region/Static: First Impressions
Figure 52 reports some of the typical responses given by taa informants to the
preliminary interviewer/speaker questions concerning the linguistic represen-
tations of the front region within the intrinsic frame of reference. Ground-man
was kept in Figure 52 as representative of the entire group of intrinsic priming
Grounds and one example is given with Ground-horse, because it is particu-
larly interesting, as it seems to deviate from Cerqueglini and Henkin’s findings
(2018). The fg interactional saliency was kept neutral in this first phase to be
checked later in a more constraining type of task.
Figure 52 summarizes a large case history that must be analyzed in further
detail. There are several prepositions and strategies that capture interesting
and specific semantic distinctions of this traditional variety: ʿa-wiğh, gabl, gid-
dām, min giddām, and min G w-giddām. From an initial analysis, it appears
that distance, possibility of interaction or affordance, position of the observer,
reciprocal position of fg and type of fg probably determine the selection of
different prepositional strategies. All these criteria are linked by a common
denominator, namely the possibility of interacting in a predictable, functional,
culturally salient, linguistically coded way.
Furthermore, comparing Scenes 1 and 4, it seems that the position of the
observer is relevant in determining the prepositional strategy. Comparing
Scenes 2 and 4, it also seems that the alignment between F and G is semanti-
cally relevant. Comparing Scenes 1 and 3, the distance and the poor affordance
that distance creates between F and G prime the selection of a different strat-
egy. Thus, Scene 5 shows an improper distance, with little interactional value,
between F and G. Comparing Scenes 6 and 8, we see that the reciprocal ori-
entation between F and G plays a role in the selection of the preposition. As
for Scene 9, one would expect the use of the unmarked preposition giddām.
Scene 10 is absolutely surprising, compared to what is reported in Cerqueglini

taa Front Region/Static: Sorting Criteria
Scene 5 is explained in Figure 31 in the previous chapter; ʿa-wiğh is used when
something is placed improperly from an interactional and/or functional point
of view, i.e., when the object obstructs vision, prevents movement or interac-
tion with other elements, is disrespectful of the person’s social space, or indi-
cates a specific functional interaction, such as having to bring an object very
close to a person’s face or an animal’s snout. Indeed, the preposition ʿa-wiğh
works as ‘in front of’ only with a person as ground and with some animals that
attract the intrinsic frame in specific functional circumstances, as in this exam-
ple from a conversation:1
al-ḥsān muruḍ, ma ākal wala išī. giddamt lih al-ākil ʿa-wiğhih, grīb minnih
‘the horse fell sick, it didn’t eat anything. I put the food in front of it, close
to it.’

Asfortheexplanationof Scene6,Figures29,30,31,and32inthepreviouschap-
ter portray in detail the distinctions captured by the opposition between gabl
andgiddām,relatedtotheinteractionaldistancebetweenfg,theirface-to-face
orientation, and the homogeneous type of fg, especially two human beings,
in which the face-to-face interaction is culturally salient, functional, and has
social and legal implications according to the traditional customs.
The criteria of selection between giddām, min giddām, and min G w-giddām
remained to be tested. Hypothetically, observing the scenes in Figure 52, the
criteria affecting the distribution of these three strategies could have been:
1.
fg ± Interactional Distance (fg are close enough to be able to interact)
2.
fg ± Interactional Orientation (fg are oriented so as to be able or unable
to interact)
3.
fg ± Alignment
4.
Observer and fg ± Alignment.
These criteria were tested by a series of tick tests.
1. fg ± Interactional Distance (fg are close enough to be able to interact). In
this test, I aimed to determine whether the parameter of distance influenced

The taa traditional view of spatial interactions among objects is strongly
affected by highly indexicalized routine actions and familiar configurations.

giddām, on the basis of the comparison between Scenes 7 and 8 in Figure 52.
If the mutual orientation is congruent on the same axis, I hypothesized that
giddām would be selected, while if fg orientations were on different axes, min
giddām would be chosen.
ThefundamentaldifferencebetweenAandBinFigures56and57isthesatis-
factionof thecriterionof reciprocalorientationbetweenFigureandGround.In
A, Figure and Ground, both asymmetrical, face toward each other, which raises
their mutual interactional potential. In B, the man is in front of the tent, but
is facing away from it so that the interactional or functional potential between
Figure and Ground is diminished.
Beyond pragmatic considerations, geometrical conditions play a role in the
selection of giddām vs. min giddām in this case. Indeed, in A, the front/back
axis of both Figure and Ground are situated along the same imaginary straight
line. The scene can therefore be reduced to a linear conceptualization, or, in
my terminology, [-multidimensional] expressed by the presence of the simple
projective preposition, giddām.
In B, F, and G, the front/back axes are not along the same line, but rather
intersect on a plane. It is certainly true that F-man is in front of G-tent, but the
front/back axes of F and G diverge by many degrees. In geometry, the presence
of two non-overlapping lines creates the entity of the plane, and in these terms
the scene is conceptualized as [+multidimensional]. The plane is a region, a
concrete and extended physical entity that cannot be reduced to a single direc-
tion. This is expressed through min giddām.
Aside from these geometric considerations, there are considerations of a
functional and metrical nature. The use of giddām reflects the satisfaction of
the criterion fg reciprocal interaction and is often accompanied by the crite-
rionfg+functionalinteractionand,of course,fg+interactionaldistance.Fand
G must be at a distance from one another that makes interaction possible. In
fact, the criterion fg reciprocal orientation alone is not enough to preclude the
use of min; if it is satisfied but the distance does not allow the realization of fg
[+functional interaction], the use of min giddām clearly prevails in the experi-
mental results.
The same is true if F and G are at a distance of [-visibility]. If, indeed, F and
G are so distant that they are not simultaneously visible to the Observer, then,
clearly, in light of the impossibility of determining whether F and G really sat-
isfy the requirement of fg reciprocal orientation, in this kind of large-scale
description, the informants usually choose min giddām.
Figures 58 and 59 add further details regarding the correlation between fg
reciprocal orientation and its functional value. The orientation of F-coffee pot,
whose handle is turned toward the man in Picture A and away from him in Pic-

ture B, produces a difference in the potential functional interaction.This differ-
ence is reflected in the selection of a simple preposition vs. a min compound.
Clearly, the sentence al-burrād wāgif min giddām az-zalamih ‘the coffee pot (is
standing) in front of the man’ produced results opposite to those produced by
the sentence with the simple preposition giddām.
In order to further interrogate these results, I also proposed the alternative
scenes in Figure 59 (and its complementary test, which is not reported here
to avoid repetition), where the handle of the coffee pot is facing the opposite
side in relation to the man, at the maximum distance from its ideal position for
interaction.
3. fg ± Alignment
I would now like to emphasize the importance of the Figure in the selec-
tion of prepositional strategies. It is usually thought that the selection of the
preposition and the frame of reference depends on the physical and geometric
properties of the ground, not the Figure. However, in the case of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ,
sincethefunctionalityof theinteractionbetweenFandGissosalient,itisclear
that F and its characteristics have a strong influence in determining preposi-
tional strategies. For example, in the case of a symmetrical F such as a tree, as
in Figures 52 vs. 54, the potential interaction is expressed only by the interac-
tional ability of the Ground and distance, not mutual orientation.
Nevertheless, comparing the two scenes, in Figure 60, it appears that ±align-
ment between Figure and Ground along the same axis also determines the
selection of giddām vs. min giddām in the cases in which Figure is a symmetri-
cal entity (a tree).
In Figure 60, Scene 2, the Figure-tree is outside the middle of Ground’s
visual field or interactional field, i.e., their potential for reciprocal interaction
decreases compared to a scene where Figure is in the middle of Ground’s inter-
actional field. When F and G appear to be aligned or F is found in the middle of
Ground’s interactional field, this property is defined here as ‘fg +alignment.’
Different semantic properties interact in the selection of prepositions with
different levels of constraining force. In order to test whether reciprocal orien-
tation or alignment is more decisive in the selection of giddām or min giddām,
I tested both parameters with asymmetrical Figures, as shown in Figure 59.
InFigure59,ScenesAandBshowfg+alignedalongthesameaxis(indepen-
dently of the position of the observer). But the functional potential decreases
in B because the handle of the coffee pot, i.e., the interactional part, is facing
away from G-man, i.e., F and G are not interactionally oriented.Therefore, with
F +faced, the neutral codification is F giddām G, while F min giddām G is the
marked form that signals the presence of F +faced with fg -interactional orien-

tation, i.e., no functional interaction is possible between F and G despite their
interactional potential.
In Figure 59, the use of the prepositional compound min giddām marks the
inaccessibility of Figure-coffee pot, which is still +aligned in front of G-man,
yet not functionally oriented. fg-alignment is thus less powerful than interac-
tional orientation with asymmetrical Figures.
In Figure 55, the use of the prepositional compound min giddām marks the

distance with all kinds of Figures, as confirmed by Figure 60, with a symmetri-
cal Figure-tree.

fg +alignment is also violated when Figure and Ground are not positioned
along the same line, as in the case shown in Figure 61, Scene B. Here, F-coffee
pot is in front of G-man, but it is placed laterally in relation to his visual and
interactional fields. This placement does not really jeopardize the possibil-
ity of fg mutual interaction, yet it represents an axial displacement, as the
front/back axes of F and G do not extend along the same ideal line.
Figures 61 and 62 are complementary. In Figures 61 and 62, as we can see,
the functional orientation between Figure and Ground is maintained across
all scenes, with the handle of the coffee pot toward the Ground-man, while
their reciprocal alignment is presented in positive (A) and negative (B) value.
The responses of the informants show that with F asymmetrical (coffee pot),
the functional reciprocal orientation of Figure and Ground is not enough to
prime the selection of the simple preposition giddām if the reciprocal align-
ment between Figure and Ground is not satisfied.
4. Observer and fg ± Alignment.
As Figure 52, Scenes 4 and 7 show, it seems that when the observer, the Fig-
ure, and the Ground are aligned along the same axis, i.e., Figure and Ground
are aligned in the middle of the visual field of the observer, the minGw-giddām
strategy is be applied.This strategy is called here the ‘min chain.’ In order to fur-
ther test this hypothesis, I created a tick test with a Ground-tent and a Figure-
man, with the man in front of the tent, standing close to it and facing toward
it. In Scene B, I aligned the position of the observer with the same axis along
which Ground and Figure were located. In Scene A, the observer is not aligned
with Figure and Ground. He looks toward them from the side, as shown in Fig-
ure 63. First, I tried the simple preposition.
Interestingly, as the results in Figure 63 show, both scenes were accepted
as correct by almost all speakers (17/20). I submitted the complementary test,
testing the use of the min chain, reported in Figure 64.
In this case, all the elderly informants selected only Scene B as suitable for
the description.The min chain indeed works when the observer is aligned with
the elements of the spatial scene. Interestingly, the use of the min chain is not
compulsory, and the simple preposition could be accepted instead Figure 63).
I also tested the use of the prepositional compound with min as preposi-
tional head, min giddām, positioning Figure and Ground at a certain distance,
as distance seems to attract this prepositional strategy. In both A and B, the
strategy was accepted as applicable, as shown in Figure 65. In Figure 66, I tested
the min chain with the same scenes.
Interestingly, again only B was selected as applicable, i.e., when Observer,
Figure, and Ground were aligned.

taa Intrinsic min chain with Figure beyond Ground
Now I set out to test whether the position of the observer had to be firmly
in front of the Ground (i.e., aligned and functionally oriented with the asym-
metrical Ground) or whether the Observer could also be behind the Ground
while Figure remained firmly in front of the asymmetrical Ground. Here some
relative response could be primed, with the Observer considering the Fig-
ure to be behind or beyond the Ground. The results are shown in Figure 67.
Fourteen of the twenty informants also preferred the intrinsic min chain in
the new Scene B, while two preferred the geocentric strategy, i.e., the use of
cardinal directions. In B, the opening of the tent, traditionally east facing,
was paradoxically oriented toward the west. As often happened during the
experiments, both informants ignored the actual orientation of the tent stim-
ulus during the experiment and affirmed that in Scene B ‘the man is east
of the tent.’ The remaining four informants used the simple preposition gid-
dām.
The last problem that remained to be tested from the first impressions
shown in Figure 52 was the use of the cardinal direction with the coffee pot
set in front of the horse. I hypothesized that since functionality is a strong
constraining force in taa, in this case Figure and Ground would not seem to
constitute a reasonable or salient interactional scene. The potential functional
interaction between Figure and Ground is also determined by the types of enti-
ties,aswehaveseenintheselectionof gabl.Forexample,acoffeepotinfrontof

ented and -functionally oriented, in the same way as I did with Figure-coffee
pot and Ground-man, and tested the use of both simplex giddām and of the
cardinal preposition, as shown in Figure 68.
After having tested min giddām with the same negative results, I attempted
to insert the cardinal preposition, in this case north šimāl, as in Figure 69.
All informants systematically approved the use of the cardinal direction in
both scenes of Figure 69, showing that Figure and Ground that are not func-
tionally compatible produce less culturally salient and less prototypical scenes.
These scenes need less precise descriptions. The geometric alignment of Fig-
ure and Ground in such cases is irrelevant, as it cannot increase the gradient of
functional interaction. From Figures 68 and 69, we learn that, even in those
cases where the axial criteria of Figure and Ground alignment are satisfied,
their functional incompatibility affects prepositional selection. The use of car-
dinal directions marks the scene as not prototypical and, therefore, inherently
casual and imprecise. The experimental data clearly show here that cultural
constraints regarding the saliency of spatial interactions are the strongest dis-
criminating criterion in taa. In other words, functional criteria prevail over
geometric and metrical features.

English does not codify the above-mentioned criteria, which seem to be
strictly correlated with cultural background and the routine, prototypically
functional scenes familiar to taa speakers. The semantic criterion fg+interac-
tional orientation and fg + alignment both seem extremely important in taa
in the selection of simple prepositions vs. min compounds. The Observer fg
+ alignment is necessary to prime the use of the min chain, even though this
strategy is not compulsorily applied under this condition, at least in the case of
the intrinsic frame seen so far.
The use of the min chain marks the application of a special hybrid type of
intrinsic frame, in which the position of the Observer is encoded in relation to
the spatial scene, i.e., some deictic information is given within an intrinsic rep-
resentation. A similar type of referential hybridity has been detected in other
genetically non-related languages (Calderón et al. 2019).

taa Front Region/Motion
The following section is the first in which the notion of a motion event is con-
sidered in this book. As stated by Pederson (2017: 574), a motion event is one
of the more basic notions in semantics, consisting of a change in location, of

vital interest to any animate organism (see also Croft et al. 2010; Gennari et al.
2002). Beyond the real motion, there is a considerable and well-documented
extension of motion expressions to other domains, and motion expression is
a driving force in grammaticalization. In this book, only actual motion is con-
sidered, leaving fictive and metaphoric motion outside the discussion (Bohne-
meyer 2010; Talmy 1996; Verkuyl and Zwarts 1992). The approach to motion
events is limited here to a set of experimental cases in which F and G tested
for frame of reference in static relations are also observed in motion scenes in
the same functions. In particular, tests are focused on the expression of G-path,
in sentences of the type: ‘F passes by G’ under different conditions of recipro-
cal orientation (Ibarretxe Antuñano 2009; Zwarts 2003). This type of analysis
is conducted for the three basic referential strategies considered in this book,
in this chapter and in the following two chapters.

scenes and the alternative response of the tick tests (see Methodology, chap-
ter3).Thesehybridexperimentsweredesignedtotesttheapplicationof simple
prepositions vs. min compounds in motion scenes along the front/back and
lateral axes. In these stimuli, culturally salient, inherently shaped, and mobile
entities were selected. All of them attracted the use of the intrinsic frame,
i.e., had inherent front/back asymmetry (Cerqueglini 2015). In some of these
videos, only Fs move, while in others both F and G move. Because of the com-
plexity of the protocol (a stimulus sentence associated with two alternative
video answers), the design was kept as schematic as possible to minimize the
influence of background elements. F-paths are marked by a dashed arrow and
G-paths by a solid arrow.
In Figure 70, two motion scenes are associated with the stimulus sentence:
a.
A man is walking at the head of a line of people, at a certain distance.
b.
A man is walking toward a group of people proceeding in a line.
Both F and G move, aligned along the same front/back axis, in the same direc-
tion in A, and in the opposite direction in B.
In Figure 70, the informants unanimously selected the first option in asso-
ciation with the simple preposition giddām. Scene B was rejected by all infor-
mants. One explained that li-giddām an-nās ‘toward the front of the people’
would have been a reasonable description for it.
In Scene B, min giddām could also be interpreted as a source description, as
F-man is moving away from the line, at its front. The roles of source and path
are along a continuum that is difficult to disambiguate. As exemplified in Fig-
ure 70, the preposition giddām is used if Figure proceeds in front of Ground
along the same axis, yet not the opposite, i.e., towards Ground.
In Figure 71, fg front/back axes are not aligned. This configuration is intro-
duced as a possible selective parameter.

chapter 5
The results shown in Figure 71 indicate that, similarly to what happens in the
static scene, the opposition between giddām and min giddām is also semanti-
cally determined by fg [alignment] in the dynamic scenes. In Figure 71, Scene
A,thefront/backaxesof FandGcrosseachother,producingageometricplane,
i.e., an extended region. Therefore, the use of min indicates the plurality of
directions present in the image and restores the nominal status of the preposi-
tion giddām. When the front/back axes of both F and G are aligned, the simple
preposition is used instead, as in Figure 70, Scene A.
2.4
taa Back Region/Preliminary Impressions
Figure 72 reports some of the typical responses given by taa informants to the
preliminary interviewer’s questions concerning the linguistic representations
of the back region within the intrinsic frame of reference.
Figure 72 summarizes a number of cases that refer to significant spatial
representations of the back region with Ground objects that prime the intrin-
sic frame of reference, according to Cerqueglini (2015) and Cerqueglini and
Henkin (2018). The cases presented in Figure 72 will be analyzed in further
detail according to the model of what was carried out for the front region. In
the case of the back region, too, there is a series of prepositions and strategies
that are supposed to capture semantic distinctions: wara, min wara, and min
G w-wara, similarly to what was seen in the case of the front region in the pre-
vious paragraphs. I set out to test whether distance, possibility of interaction
or affordance, position of the observer, reciprocal position of fg, and type of
fg determine the selection of different prepositional strategies, following the
methodology applied for the front region.We should nonetheless consider that
the possibility of interaction, or affordance, is much lower in the back region
than in the front region, the space of vision and arm movements. I thus hypoth-
esized that in the case of the back region, metrical and geometric semantic
parameters would more profoundly affect the linguistic spatial descriptions
than functional criteria such as distance, affordance, type of Figure, and the
possibility of interaction between Figure and Ground.
As I began to formulate my hypothesis, I noticed that when comparing
Scenes 1 and 2, it seemed that the reciprocal interactional orientation discrim-
inated between the use of the simple preposition and the prepositional com-
pound min wara. As I compared Scenes 2 and 3, it seemed that distance was
also a meaningful parameter in discriminating between the simple preposi-
tion and the min compound. A comparison of Scenes 1, 4, and 5 also seemed to
indicate that the position of the observer was relevant in determining preposi-
tional strategy. Comparisons of Scenes 4 and 5 and 1 and 6 seemed to show that
the alignment between F and G was also semantically relevant. As I compared

Continued: taa Intrinsic Frame. Back Region/Static. Preliminary Survey
Scenes 1 to 4 and 5 to 6, it seemed that the alignment between the observer’s
visual field and Figure and Ground also affected prepositional choice. Interest-
ingly, Scene 8, with an asymmetrical Figure, did not seem to satisfy criterion of
alignment between the observer and the entities involved in the spatial scene.
It also seemed that independently of the orientation of the Ground, even when
it was oriented toward the observer and the Figure was beyond the Ground, the
criterion of alignment with the observer was satisfied (Scene 7) and the min
chain was applied. I needed to test these aspects one by one with more refined
tools. Below is a series of the experiments I per that explain and summarize
the selection criteria of the static intrinsic prepositions in the back region in
the language of the elderly.
2.5
taa Back Region/Static: Sorting Criteria
Thecriteriaof selectionbetween wara,minwara,andminGw-waraweretested
here. Hypothetically, observing the scenes in Figure 72, the criteria that affect
the distribution of these three strategies are similar to those seen for the front
region:

1.
fg ± Interactional Distance (fg are close enough to be able to inter-
act).
2.
fg ± Interactional Orientation (fg are oriented so as to be able to interact
or not).
3.
fg ± Alignment
4.
Observer and fg ± Alignment.
These criteria were tested by a series of tick tests.
1. fg ± Interactional Distance (fg are close enough to be able to interact). In
this test, my goal was to check whether the parameter of distance influenced
the selection of wara vs. min wara, on the basis of the comparison between
Scenes 1 and 3 in Figure 72. I hypothesized that min wara would be related to
-Interactional Distance and wara to +Interactional Distance, as shown in Fig-
ure 73. Here, all informants agreed that both options could fit the sentences
proposed as stimuli. I then proceeded to the complementary test, reported in
Figure 74.
Interestingly, the use of min wara marks a wider distance between Figure
and Ground, and cannot be used when the entities are close to each other
in a prototypical interaction. Yet the simple prepositions can be used in both
cases. Indeed, while for the front region the interactional distance is crucial to
enabling interaction, in the back region the possibility of interaction is much
lower per se, so it is subject to fewer functional constraints. Nonetheless, the
min compound does mark an even lower level of affordance, probably a resid-
ual phenomenon from an ancient system, still evident in Jbāli, where the oppo-
sitions based on distance were very important. In taa, functional criteria pre-
vail, and in the case of the back region they are not as strict as in the case of the
front region.
2. fg ± Interactional Orientation (fg are oriented so as to be able to interact or
not). On the basis of the opposition noted between Scenes 1 and 2 and the case
of Scene 8, I tested the opposition between wara and min wara with different
values of fg interactional orientation, as shown in Figure 75.
All twenty informants agreed that both scenes fit the sentence. The comple-
mentary test of that shown in Figure 75 is shown in Figure 76.
From the results of the tick tests in Figures 75 and 76, it seems that while the
simple preposition can represent both scenes, the use of the min compound
marks the lack of functional orientation between the Figure and the Ground,
i.e., the front/back axis of Figure and Ground are displaced along different,
intersecting, axes.

3. fg ± Alignment. On the basis of the observations made on the existing
oppositions between Scenes 1 and 6 in Figure 72, I sought to test the effects of
alignment along an imaginary line of movement between Figure and Ground,
as shown in Figure 77.
Theinformantsrespondedunivocally,showingthatbothscenescouldfitthe
stimulus sentences. The complementary test is shown in Figure 78.
Figures 77 and 78 show that while the simple preposition can represent both
scenes, the use of the min compound marks the lack of alignment between Fig-
ure and Ground, i.e., the front/back axis of Figure and Ground are displaced
along different lines on the geometric plane.
4. Observer and fg ± Alignment. As shown in Figure 72, Scenes 4, 5, and 7, it
seems that when the Observer, Figure, and Ground are aligned along the same
axis, i.e., Figure and Ground are aligned in the middle of the observer’s visual
field, the min G w-wara strategy is applied, as seen above regarding the front
region. In this case, the tick test included a Ground-man and a Figure-tree. In
Scene A, I aligned the observer with the same axis along which Ground and
Figure where located, while in Scene B, the observer is not aligned with Figure
and Ground, but rather looking toward them from the side.

Figure 79 shows that the simple preposition wara can describe both types of
scenes. The complementary test is shown in Figure 80.
The min chain describes only the satisfaction of the criterion ofg aligned
along the same ideal line, with Figure and Ground in the middle of the
Observer’s visual field, while the simple preposition can be used in both cases,
as shown in Figure 79. Indeed, in order for the alignment criterion to be satis-
fied, Figure and Ground must be in the middle of the Observer’s visual field,
with the front/back axis of all entities set along the same ideal line.
Next, Figure 81 shows the results of the tick test on the geometric alignment
between Observer, Figure, and Ground, with Figure and Ground in the middle
of the Observer’s visual field.
When Observer, Figure, and Ground are not aligned along the same ideal
line, the min chain does not apply. The complementary test of that shown in
Figure 81 is reported in Figure 82.
Actually, while the min chain is constrained by the geometric alignment of
Observer, Figure, and Ground, the min compound indicates the displacement
of the front/back axes of the Figure and the Ground. Further tests, not reported
here, show that giddām can be applied to Figures 81 and 82, Scene A, as the

placed along the same line, the min chain cannot apply. Second, it shows that
when the front/back axes of all elements of the scene appear in a straight line,
the direction in which an asymmetrical figure actually faces is irrelevant. In
suchcases,suchasFigure84,SceneA,eithertheminchainorthesimpleprepo-

taa Back Region/Motion
Experimentsanalogoustothoseperformedforthefrontregionwereconducted
for the back region. Figure/Ground mutual alignment produced similar effects
to those shown for the front region. In Figure 85, Scene A, F-man is walking
aligned behind a line of people, moving along the same axis and in the same
direction. F is at a certain distance from G. In Scene B, F-man is walking behind
a row of static G-people. F and G’s front/back axes cross each other, forming a
geometric plane.
Figure 86 reports the results of the same pair of scenes associated with the
complementary stimulus sentence, i.e., with the min compound.
According to these results, it is possible tostate that the same axial criteria of
semanticdiscriminationbetweenwaraandminwarainstaticscenesalsoapply
to motion scenes. In motion scenes too, the criterion fg [alignment] is respon-
sible for the complementary distribution of simplex wara vs. min compound.
In the specific case of wara, in situations of -visibility, speakers prefer to
select min wara in every case, as they are not certain whether the criterion of

fg’s alignment is satisfied. Such a case is represented in Figure 87, where two

nessed this brief, interesting, interaction). The mother was not sure about the
actualpositionof herhusband’scar.Sinceshecouldnotsaywhetherhiscarwas
behind us along the same axis or not, she used the min compound (Figure 87,

When her husband’s car appeared behind them, the mother replied using the
simple preposition (Figure 87, Scene B). Figure 87 represents these scenes.

taa Lateral Region/Static
Along the lateral axis, taa does not distinguish two polarities of the right/left
type. Lateral representations are generally expressed by cardinal directions.
There is only one preposition, whose status is midway between topological and
projective,thatindicatesrelationsof laterality,i.e., ğanb‘beside,’whichcanalso
be associated with the prepositional heads fi- and ʿa(la) for both topological
and projective representations.
In the case of ğanb, taa speakers can also discriminate between the use of
the simple preposition and the min compound, as I explore below. Let us begin
with a series of sample results from the preliminary interviews. The min chain
does not apply to the lateral axis, so the position of the Observer in relation to

between F and G seems to be salient in this case for the lateral representations,
as shown in Figure 88.
From a first impression, comparing Scenes 1, 2, and 3, it appears that the
reciprocal orientation or functional orientation of Figure and Ground plays a
role in the prepositional strategy to be selected.The responses given to Scenes 1
and 4 show that distance is also relevant as a semantic discriminant for the rep-
resentational strategy, as the different strategies used for 1 and 5 demonstrate
that the alignment of Figure and Ground also plays a role. Finally, comparing 1
and 6, it is clear that the type of Figure in the spatial scene captures a semantic
difference in the value of the scene.
I tested the following criteria by means of tick tests:
1.
fg Interactional Distance
2.
fg Interactional Orientation
3.
fg Alignment
4.

1. fg Interactional Distance. I tested the alterative use of the simple preposition

preposition and the min compound under different conditions of reciprocal
orientation (interactional and non-interactional), as shown in Figure 90.
When the scene represented a possible interaction, taa speakers unani-

tion between the entities. When Figure and Ground can produce a meaningful
interaction, taa speakers prefer to choose the simple preposition. The alterna-
tive strategy, the min compound, was chosen in the complementary test with
Scene B, where the interaction between a tree and a horse were felt to be less
salient and are less frequent in the cultural inventory of spatial interactions.
These experiments confirm that min compounds are also used for less pro-
totypical, less functional interactions between Figure and Ground in the lateral
axis, as shown for the front/back axis. Furthermore, geometric alignment plays
its usual role, as seen in the front and back regions, in the selection of the sim-
ple preposition vs. the min compound.
In the specific case treated in the experiments above, the functional facet of
the horse is not its front but its side, as this is the side from which the horse can
beloaded,saddled,ormounted.WithGround-manorGround-house,theinter-
play of the mentioned criteria would undoubtedly produce different results.

In the selection of ğanb and min ğanb, the effect of the criterion of alignment
between Figure and Ground is also identifiable. When Figure and Ground pro-
ceed parallel to each another, their lateral axes are aligned, while when Figure
is moving and Ground is static, their lateral axes are displaced. In this case,

remain aligned in time and overlap in the same ideal line. Therefore, the scene

Figure 94, the same pair of scenes is matched with the complementary stimu-
lus sentence, i.e., with the min compound.

Figures 93 and 94 are geometrically complicated and not analogous to those
seen previously. In fact, for F’s lateral axis to cross at right angles to G’s lateral
axis, F would have to pass alongside G walking sideways, which is not natural
and is therefore not included in the semantic inventory of taa. Whenever F
moves sideways toward any type of static G, the normal use of the language
involves the choice of min ğanb as an indication of the role of Path. When F
moves and G is static, the lateral axes are not aligned in time and therefore the
two parallel lines form a plane. This geometric array probably triggers the use
of the min compound.

maa and yaa Intrinsic Frame
This section of the chapter does not comprise a complete description of the
intrinsic frame in the maa and yaa varieties. In these varieties, in fact, the
intrinsic frame is much more extensive than in the cases observed for taa,
and deserves a separate series of observations. In this paragraph, I compare
the responses presented in the taa section with those given to the same stim-
uli by maa and yaa speakers. Using the same types of tests consistently across
generations ensures the comparability of the data. As mentioned above, the
number of informants is the same in all the generations and divided into
the same number of men and women, the two genders traditionally recog-
nized in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ society, corresponding to different social roles and social
spaces and different geographical navigation competencies across the gener-
ations.
This section follows the structure of the section dedicated to the analysis of
the taa system. I begin with the presentation of the preliminary results and
move on to the investigation of the various semantic parameters, where rele-
vant, through closed-ended tests. I treat the front,back, and lateralregions,first
in static representations, then is motion scenes. The two generations, maa and
yaa, are addressed together in order to present the data in a way that highlights
the evolutionary trends of the referential systems and prepositional strategies.
Interestingly,themaasystemseemsmoreinternallyheterogeneous,soinsome
cases different answers will be presented. This internal heterogeneity is proba-
bly one of the characteristics that define it as a transitional system. Apparently,
or rather, formally, prepositional strategies are similar to those of taa, but are
applied on completely different and often not entirely predictable bases. The
yaa system is more homogeneously expressed among its informants, whose
congruence percentages in the answers are very similar to those seen in taa
and very different from those expressed in maa.

chapter 5
3.1
maa and yaa Front Region/Static
I begin with the presentation of the preliminary results of the open-ended
test presented at the beginning of this chapter for taa in Figure 52. When
many answers are reported, they are ordered from the more frequent to the
less frequent across each age group (twenty informants each). When only one
response is provided, it is the only one elicited within a group, or, sometimes in
both groups.
A comparison of the results obtained from taa, shown in Figure 52 at the
beginning of this chapter, and the results presented in Figure 95 for maa and
yaa reveals that the three situations are extremely different. First, it is immedi-
ately apparent that maa has formally maintained all taa strategies, especially
among the older speakers of the maa group, but they are used interchangeably
for most cases, no longer in contrastive distribution as demonstrated above
regarding taa. The position of the observer in relation to the scene, the align-
ment, the functional orientation, and the distance no longer seem crucial. It
should be noted that some speakers from this intermediate group, particularly
the older ones, speak according to the semantic features of the taa system,
but the younger ones are instead closer to the yaa group. The nature of the
intermediate group fluctuates greatly and could, indeed should, be divided
into micro-classes by age, with particular attention to level of education and
integration/modernization. All of these social and cultural parameters, homo-
geneous in the taa and yaa groups, are extremely heterogeneous in the maa
group. A more detailed analysis of the sociolinguistic profile of the intermedi-
ate maa group is currently underway, but has been delayed by the interruption
of fieldwork due to the pandemic, and will be elaborated upon and published
in future works.
As for the yaa group, its responses seem much more homogeneous than
those of the maa group. What is most striking in this case is the contraction of
prepositional strategies, with the abandonment of the min chain and the dras-
ticreductionof themincompounds.Itisclearthattheuseof thevariousstrate-
gies interchangeably due to the progressive disappearance of their semantic
oppositions through the intermediate generation has irreversibly produced
their treatment as synonyms and therefore led to choices oriented to linguistic
economy in the system. The giddām/gabl opposition, however, remains stable
across the generations and is still practiced even among the younger genera-
tions of speakers of sedentary Palestinian varieties.
It remains to be clarified why this happened and how modernization and
the accompanying changes in the interaction with natural spaces, confine-
ment in smaller spaces, sedentarization, practices of writing and driving cars,
and contact with other varieties of Arabic, in which the oppositions of the

taa system do not exist, have interacted and produced the collapse of the taa
system. The key to responding in an orderly way to these many unknowns is an
analysis of the intermediate generation at much higher analytical resolution
that entails the creation of a large enough corpus of specific individual profiles
of maa speakers that may help to shed light on the relations between the types
of responses given by each speaker and his/her relationship with each of the
above-mentioned sociocultural aspects, from formal education to adaptation
to modern life and multilingualism.
3.2
maa and yaa Front Region/Motion
This section reports maa and taa results for the hybrid tick tests that combine
motion scenes and the alternative response. The experiment’s description is
found in the corresponding Section 2.3 for taa above Figure 70).
In this case, as shown in Figure 96, all three generations agreed regarding the
selection of Scene A as the one associated with the simple preposition giddām.
But interestingly, their reasons were different. The maa speakers explained to
me that the prepositional compound with the min-head should only be used
in cases where the figure moves by crossing the frontal region of the Ground,
suchaswhenthehusbandiswatchingafootballgameontelevisionandhiswife
repeatedly crosses his visual field back and forth (see Figure 97/A). As for the
younger generation, the simple preposition cannot be used in Scene B because
the man is walking towards the group, so they felt they should say li-giddām
‘to the front,’ with a nuance of goal, or gablhum ‘in front of them,’ using the

preposition gabl, which is used with the same face-to-face configuration in
static scenes.
On the basis of the opposition between Figure and Ground ± Alignment,
maa and yaa speakers were tested. Figure 97 reports their results. The results
shown in Figure 97 indicate that the opposition between giddām and min gid-
dām in yaa is semantically determined by Figure and Ground’s conditions
of alignment. In Scene A, the front/back axes of Figure and Ground cross
each other, producing a geometric plane, i.e., an extended region. When the

As observed for the front region, regarding the back region too, maa main-
tains all the prepositional strategies seen in taa, but these are used according
to criteria other than those used in taa, while yaa is reduced to the exclu-
sive use of wara (min wara is used in yaa only in motion scenes. See 3.4
below). In particular, in maa the opposition between the simple preposition

and the min compound is neutralized in practically all cases, while, interest-
ingly, the min chain was used by seven informants only when the Figure was
behind+beyond the Ground in relation to the Observer’s position (Scene 7).
3.4
maa and yaa Back Region/Motion
Experiments on motion scenes analogous to those performed for the front
region were conducted for the back region. Figure and Ground’s mutual align-
ment produced slightly different effects to those shown for the front region,
probably due to the fact that the former still has a stronger bias toward finer
nuances and distinctions in maa and yaa. In Figure 99, Scene A, Figure-man is
walking aligned behind a line of people, moving along the same axis and in the
same direction at a certain distance from Ground. In Scene B, Figure-man is
walking behind a row of static Ground-people. Figure and Ground’s front/back
axes cross each other, forming a geometric plane.
In contrast to what happened in the analogous experiment performed for
the front region, (Figure 96), here both generations found that the simple

speakers displayed no difference in the application of the min compound to

With regard to the lateral axis, the opposition between the simple preposi-
tionandthemincompoundisneutralizedinallcasesinmaa.Someolderinfor-
mants within the group still use cardinal directions to differentiate between
regions of the lateral axis, while most informants use right/left with any kind
of animated entity (horse, in this case, but also with human beings, telephones,
computers, cars, and other objects that take whose orientation is determined
by their interactions with the human body). With inanimate entities, they use
simple ğanb or relative strategies.Those who still use the absolute frame some-
times also apply cardinal directions. As for the yaa generation, the simple
preposition ğanb is used, never the min compound. The right/left distinction
is fully developed with animated entities that are not rounded. For rounded
entities (tree, stone) right/left are attributed relatively to the observer.

maa and yaa Lateral Region/Motion
In the selection of ğanb and min ğanb, the effect of the criterion of alignment
between Figure and Ground was identified in taa. When Figure and Ground
proceed parallel to one another, their lateral axes are aligned, while when Fig-

Scene A, Figure-donkey and Ground-car are proceeding in the same direction,
while in Scene B, Figure-donkey is passing close to Ground-car, which is not
moving. Results show that the simple preposition can be used in both cases by
both generations. In Figure 103, the same pair of scenes is matched with the
complementary stimulus sentence, i.e., with the min compound.

Intrinsic Frame of Reference and Cardinal Directions in taa
As noted in Cerqueglini and Henkin (2018), in addition to the absolute framing
strategies of which the cardinal directions are typical, cardinal directions may
come to be designated via the body-centered front/back and right/left axes,
more typical cross-linguistically for intrinsic and relative framing.Thus, a com-
mon Semitic fusion of ‘left’ and ‘north’ manifests itself in Arabic in the root
š.m.l., which designates both ‘left’ and ‘north’ (Behnstedt et al. 2011: 439). Simi-
larly,theMuslimconcept‘frontwhenfacingMecca,’whichistothesouthinthe
caseof NegevArabicgiblih,isprominent.Theseconstitutelexicalbasesderived
from the human body. These uses of ‘front,’ ‘back,’ ‘right,’ and ‘left’ depend on
geocentric anchors, since only when facing east do one’s left and right hands
coincide with north and south, respectively. Of course, once a term such as
šamāl/šimāl is stabilized as a cardinal direction, its relationship with the orig-
inal meaning ‘left’ diminishes partially or completely. The two concepts are
synchronically distinct, with a small overlap. In both sedentary and Bedouin
varieties, the use of ‘front’ and ‘back’ depends on local frames that constitute
locally anchored framing. Thus, in parts of Sinai (though not in Negev Arabic),
north is wara ‘behind,’ since it is obscured by mountains, while south is giddām
‘in front’—that is, where the horizon is visible (Behnstedt et al. 2011: 439, 443).

Hybrid Strategies of the Intrinsic Frame of Reference in taa
Hybridity among referential strategies can be observed in taa in different
respects. The min chains, F min G w-giddām/wara, certainly represent intrin-
sic representations that encompass deictic information on the position of the
Observer in relation to the spatial scene. The same also happens in the relative
and geocentric frames, as shown below in chapters 6 and 7.
Furthermore, in Negev Arabic, the tent may be oriented simultaneously in
both the geocentric and intrinsic frames of reference. It is intrinsically par-
titioned according to the front/ back axis. However, its entrance obligatorily
faces the east, so a given Figure said to be ‘in front of a tent [the Ground]’ is
at the same time necessarily ‘east’ of it. The same is true of a traditional tribal
encampment, which is, in effect, a collection of tents. So, wiğh (face, east) and
gafá (nape, west) al-ʿarab (lit., ‘face’ and ‘nape of the Arabs,’ i.e., the areas at the
front and back of the camp) represent, in a cultural sense, the domains of the
important leaders and of the lowly, respectively.The latter may be found in oral
poetry and narrative designated as ġarb al-ʿarab ‘west of the camp’ (Alʿatāmīn
1991/2: 67).
According to Cerqueglini and Henkin (2018), the tent also functions as a
microcosmic and highly ritualized space, which imposes its intrinsic regions to
symmetrical, non-mobile, and inanimate Grounds that traditionally constitute
part of its furnishings, such as tent poles (henceforth simply ‘poles’) or hosting
cushions.Whentestedinsidethetent,theseGroundsalignthemselveswiththe

pole/cushion no longer prime the intrinsic frame of reference. Instead, they
behave like the G-tree/stone, which they resemble respectively in geometric
terms, priming either the relative frame of reference or the absolute, according
to the criterion of alignment with the center of Observer’s visual field. The dif-
ference in the treatment of the pole and cushion inside and outside the tent
shows that the use of the intrinsic frame of reference may be independent of
the Ground’s shape and derive from the larger spatial field (in this case, the
organized space of the tent).

chapter 6
The Relative Frame of Reference across the
Generations
In this chapter, I begin by comparing the responses given by taa, maa, and yaa
informants to the same stimuli by means of which the relative frame of refer-
ence was elicited in taa by Cerqueglini (2015). In fact, maa and yaa uses of
the relative frame of reference go beyond those uses shown by taa data. For
example, in taa the lateral axis of all Ground entities is processed in geocen-
tric terms, while across maa and yaa, the relative frame of reference is applied
especially to symmetrical Grounds along the lateral axis. Furthermore, taa
speakers apply the relative frame of reference only by translation, while maa
and yaa speakers develop additional substrategies. Moreover, taa-speakers
apply the relative frame only to a restricted set of Ground objects, while speak-
ers of maa and yaa use it in a variety of cases. The specific aspects of maa and
yaa linguistic frames of reference are treated in the second part of the chap-
ter.

taa Relative Frame of Reference: The Front/Back Axis
As Cerqueglini (2015) shows in detail, in taa familiar, symmetrical, inanimate
Grounds such as stones, trees, poles, apples, flocks, plates, or cushions, when
aligned to each other in the middle of the visual field of the Observer, prime the
relative frame of reference, using the substrategy of translation, but with some
culture-specific characteristics.The Observer’s coordinate system establishes a
broader spatial field within which symmetrical objects can be processed, just
as the tent establishes a geocentric coordinate plane in which poles, cushions,
plates, and other objects that belong to it culturally acquire its inherent orien-
tation (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2018; chapter 5).
The taa relative frame of reference, applied exclusively by translation, is
usedbyprojectingthecoordinatesystemof theObserverontotheGroundwith
the back region projected onto the side of the Ground closer to the Observer,
and the front region onto the side opposite to the position of the Observer.
This system was first studied by Hill (1982) in Hausa. In taa, the treatment
of the back and the front regions demonstrates, nonetheless, interesting and
language-specific aspects, as shown in Figures 104 and 105.

taa Relative Frame of Reference: The Back Region
As Figure104 shows,the backregionisprojectedontotheside of the Ground
object closer to the observer, indubitably according to the rules of relative
translation.
In Figure 105, I showed some examples of the treatment of the opposite
region, i.e., the front region of the aligned field, with the same Ground objects.
Chapter 5 introduced and discussed the concept of alignment and its treat-
ment in taa. In the case of the relative strategy, too, translation seems to be
possible because Figure, Ground, and Observer are aligned along an imaginary
line. As noted in Cerqueglini (2015), while the preposition wara is consistently
applied to indicate the back region, there is no trace of the application of any

taa Relative Frame of Reference: The Front Region
of the prepositions used to designate the front region (giddām, gabl, and their
compounds), as if a proper front region of the taa aligned field could not actu-
ally exist. On the contrary, taa informants systematically shift to other kinds
of designations, indicating distance (‘close, far’), alignment (‘not really on the
middle,’ ‘aligned to it, in its center’ …).When informants were asked to describe
spatial representation of the back region, their answers were generally pro-
videdmorerapidlyandweremorehomogeneous,whilefortheoppositeregion,
taa speakers were more hesitant and their responses more heterogeneous.
The use of giddām appears only with asymmetrical Ground objects (don-
key/horse/man), i.e., when the intrinsic frame of reference is applied. In 2018,

aligned field, noting that the back region is the most salient, as it is closer to the
Observer, since this referential strategy is by definition relative to the position
and perspective of the Observer and centered on his/her coordinate system.
In fact, taa speakers resist the application of the front region to unshaped
objects, probably because giddām etymologically echoes a semantic core
strictly correlated to the presence of aimed movement and something similar
to the human face, such as an animal’s snout. In other words, the use of giddām
strictly depends on the properties attributed by the speakers to the Ground
object. Such properties are prototypically non-recurrent in the Ground objects
of the aligned field, which are symmetrical, as discussed above (Cerqueglini
2017).
If we trace back the grammaticalization processes of the prepositions wara
and giddām, we clearly must address an evident semantic asymmetry; giddām
originates from g.d.m., the same root as gadam ‘foot,’2 while wara does not
have any etymological relationship to body parts located in the back region of
humanoranimalbodiesorinanyotherkindof naturalelements.3Thus, gadam
was originally part of the inventory of roots related to the human body, which
is intrinsically partitioned and asymmetrical in relation to the front/back axis.
Furthermore, in relation to ‘forehead,’ ‘eyes,’ ‘brows,’ ‘chest,’ and other body
parts used across languages to lexicalize the spatial relations occurring in the
front region of the ground object, the semantic meaning rooted in giddām
strongly correlates this preposition to the idea of the natural and prototypi-
2 The only Bedouin dialect in which the root g.d.m. is directly related to the idea of ‘foot’ seems
to be ʿAzāzmih Arabic, especially in the use of the preposition migdim ‘foot; at the foot’: ʿindī
dahab migdim Amm Rjām [poet.] ‘I have [a granary full of] gold at the foot of A.R.’ (I thank
Prof. A. Borg for providing this example). But the transparency of the affinity of the prepo-
sition with the body part name is dubious. In fact, the use of g.d.m. to indicate ‘foot’ is not
very widespread among Bedouin dialects, with some exceptions, such as gadam, pl. agdām
in ʿAnazeh (de Landberg 1940: 63). The most common word for ‘foot’ is riğl, which includes
leg and foot. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ do not recognize the reported meaning of migdim ‘at the foot of’ as
proper, saying that migdim is related not to ‘foot,’ but rather ‘to the first part of a tent or of a
natural element that appears in front of you when you are approaching it’ (see migdim al-bīt,
the middle pole in the front row of poles of the tent, Shawārbah 2007: 376).
3 Lane lists wara as ‘an adverbial noun in place and time’ (Lane 1968/1: 2933), with no reference
to any usage in relation to body part names of the back region of human or animal bodies. It
is indeed difficult in general to determine the boundary between the still adverbial usage of a
noun and its transition to prepositional usage (Blau 2010: 202). Lane quotes the verb istawara,
‘to run away one after the other (said of escaping camels)’ whose meaning encodes the con-
ceptual schema of a multitude of entities aligned one after the other and going in the same
direction.

cal direction of forward movement, the direction in which one walks.That is to
say that since a preposition is etymologically bound to asymmetrical, mobile
objects, as is the case of giddām (which in its semantic history is related to the
direction of the paths of intrinsically-oriented and mobile beings), taa speak-
ers avoid or at least resist projecting it onto symmetrical, immobile objects. To
project a front region onto a stone/tree/flock is thus perceived by taa speakers
as stranger or more erroneous than to project a back region onto them, since
the back region is prototypically less animated than the front region in asym-
metrical and mobile bodies, from which this semantic distinction originally
stemmed. Furthermore, the semantic origin of wara is literally less ‘embodied’
than the etymological origin of giddām; in an ‘object-sensitive’ spatial system,
this fact may promote the extension of wara (and other prepositions not origi-
nally bound to body parts) to a larger set of ontologically differentiated entities
(influenced by properties such as animacy, directionality, and mobility) and to
a larger set of geometric arrays than the set of situations where it is possible to
properly use giddām.
A strikingly culture-specific issue in taa spatial language is the referential
treatment of the Ground-sheep discovered by Cerqueglini (2015). Figure 106
describes the treatment of a single sheep4 within a taa aligned field. The
taa data in Figure 106 shows how features such as symmetry, mobility, and
animacy, generally used to classify objects of reality in different languages,
are subject to extreme cultural specificity in spatial discourse. Such proper-
ties are not universally attributed to the same entities and in the same pro-
portion in all languages. With particular reference to discourse about space,
human groups live in different ecosystems with different animal and plant
species and different kinds of topographical elements. As a consequence, they
develop their economic activities according to different adaptive strategies.
These strategies cause humans to rely on different sources of supply, invent
diverse ways to build houses and create tools for daily activities, orient them-
selves in space, and culturally organize the space itself. Thus, some elements
from the mineral, plant, and animal realms and some human artifacts become
more culturally salient than others, more important, more necessary. Some
of their parts, functions, and properties are more exploited, while other are
considered of lesser benefit.5 These ontologies are at the foundation of the
4 The same has been proven for the Ground-goat (Cerqueglini 2015).
5 Traditional narrative is an extraordinary source of knowledge about the properties attributed
to different entities. In the fictional space of narration, the distribution of ‘ontological prop-
erties’ and ‘cultural salience’ to natural elements, trees, stones, and animals reveals its rela-
tivistic foundations. Some entities often become main characters of tales and can speak and

cultural representations of space expressed in languages. I use the term ‘ontol-
ogy’ and not ‘hierarchy’ because, in fact, the partition of realia on the basis
of certain properties does not entail in all languages and cultures a hierar-
chical classification based on a vertical scale of implications similar to the
taxonomical system according to which contemporary Western cultures rep-
resent the natural world based on Darwin’s evolutionary theory. Thus, even
though the sheep, the goat, and the horse should belong to the same animal
category on the basis of both certain shared features and our scientific knowl-
edge, in taa they appear in the linguistic description as very different entities,
sheep/goat being in an intermediate position in relation to stone/tree/flock
and donkey/horse/man.
Unlike horse/dog/man/camel, sheep and goat have no inherent front and
back regions in the spatial domain. Once aligned in the middle of the Obser-
ver’s visual field, they prime the use of the taa aligned field, with a back region,
the one closer to the Observer, and a front region, beyond the ground. Giddām
is never applied, as if the snout of the sheep would have no value in the spatial
domain.
Yet a sheep is not exactly like a stone or a tree. Despite the use of the same
referential deictic strategy, a relevant difference in the grammatical treatment
of Ground-stone/tree and Ground-sheep is apparent: the back region of the
aligned field is described by wara only when the rear part of the sheep coin-
cideswithit(Figure106,Scene1).Thecoincidenceof therearpartof theanimal
and the back region of the aligned field seems indeed to be salient in the spatial
scene, since, according to Middle Eastern shepherding practices, the sheep are
pushed to the pasture from behind.
Even in the Bedouin as-Sayyid sign language, the sheep is represented with
its tail toward the speaker (Sandler et al. 2005), just as it appears in the rou-
tine real-life scene, where the animal proceeds to the grazing area pushed from
behind by the shepherd, as shown in Figure 107.
When the snout of the animal coincides with the back region of the aligned
field (Scene 2) the prepositional strategy min G w-ğāy, lit. ‘from it (sheep) and
move even if they do not do so in real life, while others that actually show stronger animacy
or capability of motion are ignored. Among entities that should apparently show the same
semantic properties, we observe a differential treatment instead.Translating this observation
to the linguistic domain of space at the foundation of a relativistic approach to the debate on
ontologies, in particular spatial ontologies, I observed that the presence or absence of a deter-
mined set of features generally accepted in the scientific discourse (e.g., a sheep/goat should
be more mobile and more oriented than a stone/tree/flock and as mobile and oriented as a
donkey/horse/man) does not always correspond to the expected linguistic behaviors from a
cross-cultural perspective.

probably due to the intention to avoid a conflict between the geometric region

values still interfere somewhat in the selection of the linguistic strategy. The
geometrically opposite region, the front region of the aligned field, is defined
as min G w-ġād, lit. ‘from it (sheep) and beyond (in relation the position of

or in the opposite direction (Scenes 2 and 4). This deictic prepositional min

chain doublet is applied only to the sheep/goat within the aligned field, not to
trees and stones, poles, cushions, and other traditional, salient, yet symmetri-
cal objects in the Ground function. The status of the sheep/goat as unshaped
or quasi-symmetrical entities is confirmed by the adoption of the same min
chain doublet when the animal is set transversally to the Observer’s visualfield,
so that its sides coincide with the front and back regions of the aligned field
(Scenes 5 and 6).
In conclusion, I can state that in the taa semantic organization of space,
ontological properties of ground objects override geometrical dispositions,
even when the entities have weak ontological properties, such as the weak
asymmetry of the sheep/goat in relation to the strong asymmetry of the don-
key/horse/man in the partition of the front/back axis. In maa and yaa, the
prevalence of the geometric properties is observable, together with a general
weakening of attention to ontological properties due to radical sociocultural
changes. Indeed, the ontological properties of the entities that inhabited the
Bedouinworldwereconceivedandsharedwithinthegroupintraditionaltribal
life.
taa language preserves the remnants of a spatial system strongly based on
the features of the object protagonists of arrays. Even in the application of the
aligned field, the characteristics of the objects and the values they possess in
relation to the criteria of animacy, mobility, and directionality have a priming
effect in the selection of strategies for the description of their spatial relations.
Thus, the core of the taa spatial system reveals evidence of a powerful classifi-
catory system of the entities of the world that strongly primes the partition of
entities into spatial regions according to a set of ontologically defined param-
eters. The interaction of these ontological parameters with more metrical and
geometrical ones (alignment, centrality) comprises a trace of cognitive con-
tinuity and, finally, hybridity, between the relative and intrinsic strategies. A
distinct sense of conceptual proximity among referential strategies strongly
characterizes the taa linguistic system and may point the way to new hori-
zons of cross-linguistic enquiry on the conceptual development and mutual
translatability of referential strategies and their fundamental semantic param-
eters.
It is important to emphasize that in taa, the aligned field applies only when
Observer, symmetrical Ground, and Figure are ‘aligned,’ i.e., set in a row, irre-
spective of the orientation of the Ground, even if it is a sheep/goat, perceived
as ‘semi-symmetrical.’ This ‘alignment’ can be realized in spaces 1 and 2 indi-
cated in Figure 108: Space 1 (in front of the Observer), and Space 2 (at the right
or left side of the Observer), i.e., in the areas of the Observer’s visual field that
are parallel to his/her front/back axis and parallel to his her right/left axis. In

of Use of the Relative Frame of Reference
these positions, the criterion of alignment can be fulfilled and, consequently,
with a symmetrical Ground, the relative frame of reference is applied.6
In taa, in the whole range of non-aligned positions (indicated by the ellipse
in Figure 108), when the symmetrical Ground and the Figure are not aligned
with the Observer, the arrays are automatically described by applying the geo-
centric frame of reference, i.e., by means of cardinal directions. This happens
because the alignment between the symmetrical Ground, the Figure, and the
Observer is essential for the application of relative strategies in taa.
2
The Lateral Axis of the aligned field
For taa, by placing the Figure and the symmetrical Ground on a horizon-
tal line in front of the eyes of the Observer, I could examine the semantic
effects of the lateral axis. The results are, again, very consistent with the effects
of the low degree of asymmetry (or low degree of inherent anatomical par-
tition) attributed to a sheep/goat in the domain of space, as shown in Fig-
ure 109.
6 Unfortunately, due to the different purposes of his contribution, Hill did not describe the
responses of the Hausa speakers in all those cases where the arrays were placed in different
positions from the middle of the visual field of the Observer (i.e., lateral sides and other non-
aligned directions).

taa g-Sheep/Geocentric vs. Relative Strategy/Figure-Ground-Observer Alignment/1
As we can see from the results shown in Figure 109, representative of the
twenty taa informants, when Figure and Ground are not aligned in the middle
of the Observer’s visual field, but set transversally to it, the prepositions ğanb
or ʿa-ğanb are used, even in Scene 4, where ‘beside the sheep’ is used instead
of ‘in front of the sheep,’ consistently with what was described in the previ-
ous paragraphs. Furthermore, with Figure and Ground set transversally to the
Observer’svisualfield,thegeocentricframeof referenceappliedthroughcardi-
nal directions is the most popular solution in taa. Nonetheless, a novel finding
showsthatwhenthefront/backaxesof oneof theelementsof thespatialscene
are displaced by several degrees from the alignment, the cardinal directions
are also applied. I tested this hypothesis by means of a tick test. Its results are
reported in Figures 110 and 111.
The informants consistently preferred Scene A, where Figure-man is dis-
placed from the middle of the Observer’s visual field and from the alignment of
the entire scene. Figure 111 reports the test with the complementary stimulus
sentence, i.e., the relative strategy with simplex wara.
In the test reported in Figure 111, informants unanimously preferred Scene
B, where Figure-man is aligned with Ground-sheep.

Differences between taa and Hausa Aligned Fields

taa g-Sheep/Geocentric vs. Relative Strategy/Figure-Ground-Observer’s Alignment/2
As mentioned above, the taa strategy for the spatial description of aligned
arrays located in the middle of the Observer’s visual field and with symmet-
rical objects as Ground cannot be formally represented by the paradigm of
the ‘Hausa system’ as it has been described in the literature. For this reason,
I designate this particular taa strategy ‘aligned field’ and not ‘Hausa system,’
consistently with the dominant role of the criterion of alignment explored in
the chapter on taa spatial representations.
UnlikeHausa,givenasymmetricalGroundandthegeometriccircumstances
of the aligned field, the projection of the front/back axis onto the Ground ob-
ject does not occur in taa by default. taa speakers look at the properties of the
Ground objects rather than following the geometric layout of the visual field.
It seems, then, that under the label of ‘symmetrical objects,’ the spatial entities
selectedasGroundinthealignedfieldalsoshow,tovaryingextents,otherprop-
erties that affect the selection of the prepositions used to describe the spatial
relations betweenthem andthe Figureobjects.This phenomenon isconcretely
demonstrated in taa in the differential treatment of Ground-sheep/goat.
Yet some cases are similar. For example, when Hill described the Hausa
alignedfield,hepointedoutthecharacteristicfeaturesof itsapplication.When
Figure is hidden by Ground, the rules of translation seem to be broken. Indeed,
in Hausa a Figure object hidden by the Ground object is always described as
being in the back region of the Ground object. Concealed objects attract the
use of the back region even when the rules of the aligned field require the use
of the front region, or, in other words, a concealed object primes the use of the
projective strategy of reflection, as shown in Figure 112:

Figure Hidden by Ground: The Hausa Projective Response
from hill (1982: 22, figure 6)
Like Hausa speakers, under the conditions of the aligned field, taa speakers
project a back region onto the invisible part of the Ground object in order to
locate a Figure object hidden or partially hidden by the Ground object. Indeed,
wara etymologically correlates to the idea of concealment from sight. This also
applies on a large scale, for example when the Figure is completely hidden by
the Ground, such as a wadi located on the other side of a mountain. In this
case, taa speakers can also resort to the min chain, saying min al-ğabal w ġād,
lit. ‘from the mountain (the Ground) and away’ (from the Observer), i.e., on the
opposite side of the Ground in relation to the position of the Observer.
Like taa, Hausa has a culture-specific treatment of the alignment field.
Comparing the Hausa system of projection of coordinate axes with the English
and French systems, Hill started from cases in which a symmetrical object such
as a ball is the Ground in a spatial array. Such cases represent the seman-
tic core that primes the prototypical use of the relative frame of reference.
Nonetheless, it seems that in Hausa, the application of the aligned fieled is
primed not only by the ball but also by such objects as the telephone, which
Hill describes, according to the logic of European languages, as intrinsically
partitioned according to its functional properties, with its display associated
with the front region, so that the back region and the lateral regions should be
attributed accordingly. But in Hausa, a Ground object such as the telephone,

Furthermore, even though the telephone is set perpendicularly to the aligned

eralfacets,Hausaspeakerssensenosemanticconflictanddonothesitatetouse
the prepositions gaba ‘in front of’ and baya ‘behind’ in correspondence to the
lateral sides of the telephone. In other words, Hausa speakers do not attribute
to the telephone any intrinsic partition. A similar phenomenon occurs in taa:
the anatomical partition of the Ground-sheep/goat has only very minor spa-
tial effects, and never primes the use of intrinsic strategies. Nonetheless, as
we have seen above, taa speakers apply a clear semantic distinction between
Ground-stone/tree/flock and Ground-sheep/goat. In the former case, they use
the strategy of translation for the back region and alternative expressions for
the front region, while in the latter they use the strategy of translation when
the back region of the aligned field corresponds to the rear part of the ani-
mal and the doublet minnih w-ğāy/ minnih w-ġād in all other cases. Nothing
similar happens in Hausa, where only the prepositional doublet gaba/baya ‘in
front’/‘behind’ is used with all kinds of Grounds in every position in the aligned

field. It seems thus that clear differences exist even in the application of the
aligned field across cultures and languages. This is due to the different cultural
strategies of ontological classification of the entities in the domain of space
and the different proportions according to which ontological properties and
geometric schemes can prevail.
As for the lateral axis of the Hausa system, Hill (1982) reported that in Hausa,
the right/left axis projected onto the Grounds could be the same as that of
the Observer according to the rules of translation or projected by rotation, i.e.,
the right side of the Observer corresponds to the left side of the Ground as if
Observer and Ground were facing each other. The only example reported by
Hill on the right/left axis has a human Ground. In this case, the Hausa speakers
seemed to respect the inherent right/left partition of the Ground (Hill 1982:
32 Figure 16). Unfortunately, the author does not mention any symmetrical
Ground for the right/left axis. Nonetheless, the fact that the human body as
Ground yields an intrinsic frame of reference indicates that, at least to a cer-
tain extent, Hausa speakers pay attention to ontological properties of objects
in space and the translation realized on the aligned field is not the only possi-
ble strategy applicable to arrays set in the middle of the Observer’s visual field.
I regret not having more information about the ontological constraints that
affect the language of space in the Hausa culture for comparative purposes.

taa Relative Prepositional Strategies
Another difference between taa and Hausa is surely the number of strategies
used by taa speakers to further detail relatively framed spatial scenes. I have
shown the meaning of the min chains used in the aligned field, but the sim-
ple preposition wara and the min compound min wara also indicate different
meanings. taa speakers’ attitudes toward the assessment of the inherent prop-
erties of different objects and the effects of these culturally attributed prop-
erties in the spatial description strongly prime the development of different
prepositional means to describe the relations between ontologically different
Grounds and Figures even within the same relative strategy. In taa, different
conditions constrain the selection of the most appropriate description of spa-
tial relations, a process that is ultimately multifactorial.
These conditions seem to be:
1.
Ontological status of the entities in the array (and their properties)
2.
Semantic origin of the prepositions
3.
Figure, Ground, and Observer’s Alignment
4.
Functional orientation of the entities involved in the array.

Thus, the following sentences do represent different configurations:

az-zalamih wāgif wara al-ḫarūf ‘the man is standing behind the sheep,’
(2)
az-zalamih wāgif min wara al-ḫarūf ‘the man is standing behind the

The results of the tick test, shown in Figures 114, 115, and 116, that treated the
reciprocal orientation of Figure and Ground.
The results presented in Figure 114, 115, and 116 display some parameters
similar to those seen for the intrinsic frame in chapter 5, where the recip-
rocal orientation of Figure and Ground and its functional implications pro-
duce a differential selection (or contrastive distribution) of simple preposi-
tions vs. min compounds. In the case seen in Figures 114 and 115 in particular,
the prototypical, functional position of the shepherd in relation to the sheep
is behind it and aligned with it in order to push it to pasture (A), while the
complementary one (B), is not functional, culturally indexicalized, or proto-
typical.
To test this hypothesis on the effects of functional parameters, I created a
Scene B, in which the same properties as Scene A were maintained, and only
distance (which is detrimental to functional affordance) was increased (Figure
116, Scene B).
My hypothesis was confirmed; increasing the distance means that the pos-
sibility of interactions decreases, so the min compound is preferred over the
simplex preposition. In many cases, in circumstances such as those proposed

Treatment of the Flock as Ground: Projection of Front and Back Regions Only

The Culture and Philosophy of the taa Traditional Ontology of
Space
Outside the aligned field, the only possibility of using wara al-ḫarūf ‘behind
the sheep’ and giddām al-ḫarūf ‘in front of the sheep’ is when many sheep are
moving in the same direction, i.e., moving as a flock (not a static flock as I used
in my arrays), when they are facing in the same direction one after the other in
a row, as one of my informants explained to me by means of my toy objects, as
shown in Figure 117.
When the flock is the Ground, it is difficult to establish its front and back
regions, mainly due to the absence of any effect of motion. When the flock is
in motion, its regions are given by the sum of the directions of all its elements.
What is more difficult to understand is why sheep/goat is considered in
many cases a symmetrical object and treated according to the semantic strate-
gies of the aligned field similarly to stone/tree/flock, even if not exactly in the
same way, as we have seen. A sheep/goat, when alone, i.e., not in a flock, should
have the same properties of intrinsic anatomical partition, mobility, and direc-
tionalityasadonkey/horse/man,butthisfactdidnotfitmyinformants’rulesof
speech. Returning to the ideal inventory of possible properties that have been
cross-linguistically detected and could affect the treatment of the Ground in
spatial discourse, I hypothesized that the different treatment of the sheep/goat
in relation to the donkey/horse/man could be a question of size. I wondered
whether the smaller size could be the reason for less animacy, less mobility and
less inherent directionality. I then proceeded to test the informants by placing
a dog as Ground instead of a sheep/goat in the same positions occupied by the

sheep in former experiments, i.e., aligned in the center of the visual field of
the Observer. Significantly, the dog primed the same use of the intrinsic frame
of reference as the donkey/horse/man. The rules of the regional partition of
the aligned field did not seem to apply at all. I concluded that the dog was not
considered a symmetrical object, although its size is more similar to that of a
sheep/goat than to that of a donkey/horse/man. The hypothesis regarding size
was not supported.
The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ ontologies of spatial discourse have particular criteria for the
classification of entities that are not completely reducible to geometrical prop-
erties such as size and symmetry, or to mechanical properties such as mobil-
ity. The aṣ-Ṣāniʿ system of ontological classification of world entities includes
a structure of classificatory features that combines different proportions of
geometrical and mechanical elemental categories, on one hand, and specific
features, on the other. These specific features are strictly related to the daily
experience of the speakers with the entities in question, and at the same time
entail complex semantic and symbolic properties understandable only within
the cultural context. In other words, these are culture-related ontological fea-
tures that are not understandable as cognitive universals.
Carnivorous animals of the Negev, like wolves and foxes, are very familiar to
the Bedouins as a constant threat to their flocks. These animals are considered
very active, mobile, dynamic, and animated entities. My informants say that
the best sheep dogs are the half-breeds born from the cross of dogs and wolves,
but they sometimes attempt to eat the sheep instead of protecting them, so
they cannot really be trusted. Carnivores have their own intentions, even their
own characters, and are often protagonists in fairy tales, mainly in the role of
villains, and feature in detailed descriptions of hunting sessions,7 where their
interesting and somehow curious behaviors in the wild are carefully reported.
I asked my informants why the sheep appeared in many cases as less ani-
mated than other animals, such as donkeys, horses, and dogs. They answered
that carnivores, similarly to horses and camels, are considered intelligent and
capable of making decisions about targets, movements, and directions. This
fact explains, for the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, the higher mobility and directionality of these
animals, their grace and their beauty, when compared to sheep. The fact that a
sheep/goat is considered a symmetrical Ground in the domain of space is thus
not related to its anatomical properties as such, but rather to a combination of
geometric, behavioral, and symbolic meanings that, in the final analysis, repre-
sents the expression of the specific culture.

Theinformantsreportedthatcamelsandhorsesaretreatedwithrespectand
care. They can move across great distances, run, and follow directions,8 while
sheep and goats always go together without a precise target. They just move
around, never raising their heads, always eating face down. Someone who has
no aim in life is said ‘to be one who goes around like a sheep,’ or just ‘[one] who
goes where others go.’9This behavior is considered dangerous and a sign of lim-
ited intelligence. Such people, like sheep, are seen as victims of circumstances
and unable to improve their lives. In contrast, a plethora of specific motion
verbs is used to describe different styles, speeds, and conditions of the gaits of
horses and camels.10 Another important feature that affects the treatment of
sheep/goats as Grounds is that they are seen usually in flocks and very seldom
alone, a fact that somehow decreases the individualistic value of the animacy
attributed to an individual member of the category.11
From an acquisitional point of view, the current theory that accounts for
the order in which frames of reference are developed claims that the intrinsic
frame was developed earlier than the relative. Levinson writes:
8
Among the Rwala, the body of the camel is used as a means to orient one’s own direction
according to the stars, the same as the body of the traveler: ‘Mind the North Star, ofṭon
al-ğedi.’ ‘Lay the North Star on the face of thine animal’ means take a northerly course;
‘Lay it on thy left brow’ means take a north-northeast course; ‘Lay it on thy left shoulder’
indicates ‘go northeast;’ ‘Lay it on thy saddleback from the left’ means ‘go eastwards;’ ‘Lay
it on the back saddle knob’ means ‘go south,’ and so on. (Musil 1928: 355). As we can see,
‘right’ and ‘left’ are sometimes used. Nonetheless, their use is anchored to the system of
cardinaldirections.Descriptionsof spatialrelationsbymeansof ‘right’and‘left’according
to the relative or intrinsic frame of reference are very rare. In the language of the Rwala,
the root y.m.n., from which yamīn ‘right (side)’ comes, also produces the verb yamman
‘to set right’: ‘Should the rider fall asleep and the animal change her course while graz-
ing, his companion calls to him ‘set thy camel riding right!’ jammen delûlak!’ (Musil 1928:
355).
9
The lack of purpose and aim and the tendency to have a weak will is considered by all my
informants to be a severe affliction in life. It is often described by metaphors related to the
domain of motion and in particular to the lack of direction of one’s motion. This behavior
is often associated with that of sheep in proverbs and colloquial expressions.
10
Adetailedsurveyof suchverbswouldfalloutsidethescopeof thepresenttreatise.Iintend

11
Animals that usually live in flocks can, as single entities, prompt speakers to use the
semantic properties of the group. In Bedouin languages, there is a lexical difference
between al-ġanámah ‘the sheep’ (singular), ġanamāt ‘many single sheep’ (plural), and
ġanám ‘sheep’ (collective). As outlined by Blanc 1990: [9–10], the collective term ġanám
is used for the flock of goats or sheep and goats (Stewart 1990: 225). In the rural Arabic
dialect of Tulkarem, ʿanzih can refer to both the sheep and the goat (while ʿanz in Negev
Arabic means only ‘goat’). For the northern Arabs, ġanamih is the offspring of the ʿanzih,
i.e., the lamb or kid (from fieldwork in the Northern dialects, February 2014).

the relative frame of reference across the generations
329
Linguists have long distinguished ‘deictic’12 vs. ‘intrinsic’ frames of refer-
ence, because of the rather obvious ambiguities of a sentence like ‘The
boy is in front of the house’—the boy can be at the house’s front, or the
boy can be between the speaker and any side of the house (see, e.g., Leech
1969: 168; Fillmore 1971; Clark 1973). It has also been known for a while
that linguistic acquisition of these two readings of terms like ‘in front,’
‘behind,’ ‘to the side of’ is in the reverse direction from the developmental
sequence ‘egocentric’ to ‘allocentric’ (Pick 1993): ‘intrinsic’ notions come
resolutely earlier than ‘deictic’ ones (Johnston and Slobin 1979).
levinson 2006: 31
Levinson also states the following:
The intrinsic frame of reference is close to linguistic bedrock, in that it is
near universal. Although there are languages,like the Australian language
Guugu Yimithirr (Haviland 1979; Levinson 1997), that use it minimally,
most have fairly elaborate systems of one kind or another. There are lan-
guagesthatalmostexclusivelyrelyonit,likeMopan(Danziger1996,1999).
Children appear to acquire it earlier than other systems (Johnston and
Slobin 1979).
As Levinson notes, these facts are quite puzzling, because the principles for
assignment of intrinsic facets are culture-specific and often highly complex
(Levinson 2006: 81).
With respect to Johnston and Slobin’s assumptions, in the case of sheep/
goats in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, it seems that the development of a complete intrin-
sic frame that partitions the body of these animals, entailing the application of
theaxialoppositionof frontregionvs.backregion,shouldhavebeenprevented
and overshadowed by the use of the relative coordinate system, anchored on
the Observer, leaving behind only some weak semantic effects.
The origins of the cognitive split between Grounds that attract the use of the
intrinsic frame of reference and those that attract the relative frame of refer-
ence are doubtlessly worth investigating, because they seem to contradict the
universalistic claims of acquisitional theories that support the earlier devel-
opment of the intrinsic frame of reference in relation to the relative and the
implicational relationship between them.
12
The term ‘deictic’ (Leech 1969; Levinson 1983; Levelt 1984) is replaced by the definition of
the viewer-centered relative frame of reference proposed by Levinson (2006: 26 and 32).

chapter 6
The semantic categorization of entities in space and the attribution of dif-
ferent features or degrees of semantic features to animals of the traditional
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ world seem very likely to be primed by the routine and ritualized daily
experience of the linguistic group in its activities with these animals. In tra-
ditional life, sheep farming entailed a number of different seasonal practices,
fromdriving theherdstoneighboringgrazingfieldseverydayanddrivingthem
back in the evening, to the temporary relocation of some family members with
the herds to pastures located at a certain distance from the village, to seasonal
migrations along the east/west axis (toward the inland areas, toward the sea),
whichinvolvedtherelocationof theentirefamilyencampment.Alltheseactiv-
ities are described by means of a specific lexicon that includes a plethora of
motion verbs that often contain temporal information in accordance with the
recurring time setting.
My direct experience demonstrated that seasonal semi-nomadism over very
short distances is still practiced by some of the elderly men, including myinfor-
mants. Generally, in the month of April, they leave the village with the herds
and move to the pastures, located at a certain distance from the village, where
they remain over the summer, living in tents or other kinds of provisional shel-
ters. Nowadays, in the winter months, herds are kept in stalls in the village.
According to the narratives of one of my oldest informants (92 years old), in
the past girls as well as boys went to watch the herds away from the village,
in daily grazing or even at significant distances from the village, moving on
foot or, less frequently, on camelback. This is the reason why they proudly refer
to being able to ride animals and shoot for defense. The only difference was
that girls and boys once traveled in groups, while men nowadays often travel
alone.
Tales, narrations, sayings, and metaphors reveal that for the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ a sig-
nificant characteristic of sheep/goats is that they proceed without raising their
heads, i.e., without knowing any direction but the way to the next tuft of grass.
Shepherds usually drive them forward, walking behind them to prevent them
from separating and getting lost.
In a Sinai dialect narrative (Marom 2012: 126), we find a depiction of a girl-
shepherd driving the herd ahead: bitḫalli lmiʿzë yğin giddāmha ‘she lets the
goats go before her.’ Consequently, the routine position of sheep/goats/flocks,
especiallywhentheyareinmotion,isalignmentinfrontof theshepherd,facing
the direction of movement. Therefore, the front region of the animal coincides
withthatof theObserver,whileitsbackregioncoincideswiththespacedirectly
in front of the Observer, so its distinction becomes salient and it is expressed
by the preposition wara ‘behind’ according to the general rule of the aligned
field.

The same does not happen with horses, donkeys, and camels, which are usu-
ally ridden, or with dogs, which usually walk alongside humans when they are
hunting or herding. These quadrupeds tend to ‘fuse’ with humans in terms of
space and movement, in a manner radically different from human interaction
with sheep/goat herds, which the herder follows.13
The attribution of the back region marked by the use of the preposition
wara when the rear part of the sheep/goat coincides with the back region of
the aligned field could be a residual effect of an incipient intrinsic partition,
where the only salient part of the animal experienced in routine activities
finds its place within the framework of the traditional spatial ontology. In other
words, the ritualized conceptualization of day-to-day activities has introduced
an asymmetry in the axial front/back opposition, according to what Levinson
has observed:
Having found, for example, the ‘front,’ this may be used to anchor a ready-
made system of oppositions ‘front,’ ‘back,’ ‘sides’ etc. Alternatively, in
other languages, there may be no such fixed armature as it were, each
object having parts determined by specific shapes; in that case, finding
‘front’ does not predict the locus of ‘back’ etc., but nevertheless deter-
mines a direction from the volumetric center of the object through the
‘front’ which can be used for spatial description.

With respect to this observation, the case of the knife in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ is very inter-
esting, because this utensil has an intrinsic front region expressed by the body
part ‘face’ (ʿa-wuğh al-ḫūṣah, lit. ‘at the face of the knife’), but it has no inherent
back region (something like *ʿa-ḏ̣ahar al-ḫūṣa, lit. ‘at the back of the knife,’ to
indicate that something is on the opposite side of the knife in relation to the
blade, is not in use).
In aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic, the impact of culture-specific constraints seems to inter-
sect and deeply affect the selection of the appropriate frame of reference in
relation to the features attributed to Grounds and call into question the terms
of the supposedly universal process of sequential acquisition, or application, of

of wara. It therefore seems that recurring experiences produce some effect on
spatial semantic categories, as supported by the gradual collapse of the aligned
field among middle-aged and young speakers, among whom we witnessed the
switch first to the opposition gabl/baʿd ‘before’/‘after’ in the treatment of the
aligned field and then to the use of new and alternative geometric and func-
tional strategies. The priming effect of recurrent experience with sheep/goats
in motion accounts for the poverty of asymmetry, directionality, and mobility
in their linguistic spatial location.
Nonetheless, it is important to remember that, in the language of the aṣ-
Ṣāniʿ, the ontological properties attributed to entities in relation to the domain
of space are not necessarily valid in other linguistic domains. In the domain of
space, the sheep/goat is less mobile, and, somehow, less relevant than the don-
key/horse/man,butthelowsalienceof theinherentasymmetriesof thebodyof
the sheep/goat within the domain of spatial description does not correspond
to a lack of knowledge regarding the anatomy of these animals. In a conver-
sation among aṣ-Ṣāniʿ housewives on recipes, the anatomy of sheep/goat may
turn out to be very detailed. Moreover, as we have seen, in the domain of color
terms, sheep, goats, and stones enjoy the same abundance of specific terms as
camels and horses (Borg 2007). This may be explained by the fact that using a
precise color system that describes the coat is the best means of recognizing
each owner’s animals.14
In sum, properties culturally attributed to entities do not constitute an abso-
lute ontology according to which an entity is classified once and forever in
every domain of a given language. We should, rather, maintain that, to a cer-
tain extent, linguistic ontologies can be considered domain-based classifica-
tions. Thus, in spatial relations, the sheep/goat is considered to have less inher-
ent asymmetry and salience than the donkey/horse/man, but more than the
stone/tree/flock. In other domains, salience and pertinent linguistic distinc-
tions may well change.

maa and yaa Relative Frame of Reference
To begin, I compare the treatment of the same Ground objects that prime the
relative frame in taa to the treatment given to them by speakers of maa and
yaa. I then go on to expand the survey of the relative frame of reference over
the maa and yaa generations, including the treatment of the lateral axis and
the development of right and left.

the relative frame of reference across the generations
333
For the sake of comparison, I present here again the scenes submitted to taa
informants, whose results are reported in Figures 104 and 105, in order to show
the responses given to the same scenes by maa and yaa informants to both
back and front regions in Figure 118.
Figure 118 presents two generational situations that are very different from
each other and certainly different from the taa representation of the front/
back axis with geometrically symmetrical Grounds. In particular, the maa sit-
uation appears particularly chaotic, with the retention of all the taa preposi-
tional strategies and the addition of others, even borrowed from the temporal
domain, for doubtful cases.
Since the taa system of opposition is clearly no longer operational, there
are many doubtful cases, with paradoxical results. There are even maa speak-
ers who do not clearly distinguish the frontal region from the posterior region
with symmetrical objects, even by means of relative strategies. The outcomes
are often contradictory, with the same region given the meaning of both front
and back, even by the same speaker in different scenes. The older participants
of the maa group still use the cardinal directions, also applying them in the
aligned field in doubtful cases. The most complex issue is the distinction of an
anterior and a posterior zone for symmetrical objects, and the geometric rules
of partition of the aligned field operative in taa no longer work.
The strategy most widely used by mma speakers is the min chain preposi-
tional doublet F min G w-ğāy/F min G w-ġād, which distinguishes two opposite
regions on the basis of proximity/distance from the Observer, without implica-
tions regarding the distinction between the front and back regions. From this
point of view, it seems particularly interesting to note the use of the temporal
prepositions gabl/baʿd, ‘before/after,’ which have no links, not even etymologi-
cal ones, with parts of the body and spatial regions, but are rather of adverbial,
‘unembodied,’ origin.
However, again, in the case of temporal prepositions, the informants found
theattributionuncertainandunstable.Itisunclearwhethertheanteriorregion
should be the region close to the Observer or the farthest, but most advanced
region. The same hesitation applies to temporal posteriority. This hesitation is
due to the fact that the relative frame of reference, though still associated in
maa with the symmetrical Grounds aligned with the Observer, is thought of as
being in both the translation and reflection criteria. Thus, the relative substrat-
egy of reflection is progressively developing, although this creates confusion
with the concurrent relative substrategy of translation, which was inherited
from previous generations. The confused situation of the answers of the maa
group is due, as I explained in the previous chapter, to the age of its members
and its sociocultural heterogeneity. Only a deep and multifactorial analysis of

the personal profiles of the speakers will provide further explanations of the
actual transition between the different referential strategies.
Among young people, the answers are less ambiguous, and the system is
outlined more clearly, with a neat orientation towards the projection of the
relative frame through the substrategy of reflection, with the projection of the
frontal region in the part of the Ground closest to the Observer (Scenes 1, 2, 3).
The opposite region, on the far side of the Ground in relation to the Observer,
is, on the other hand, more problematic and its representation depends on

several concomitant factors, such as the conditions of visibility of the Fig-
ure beyond the Ground. Thus, when the Figure beyond the Ground is larger
or still visible (Scenes 4 and 7), speakers are divided between the front and
back regions, while some resolve the dilemma with the neutral ‘beside.’ When
the Figure is smaller than Ground or concealed by Ground from Observer’s
sight, wara is the only possible option (Scenes 5 and 6). When both asym-
metrical Figure and Observer face each other, the selection of the strategy is
significantly affected. In fact, when the asymmetrical Figure turns towards the
Observer, its front region and the Observer’s front region coincide (Scenes 4
and 7) and conceptually prevail over the position of the symmetrical Ground
and the geometric rules it determines. In doubtful cases, ‘beside,’ ğanb, is the
neutral option.

maa and yaa Treatment of Ground-Sheep
In Figure 119 I present a snapshot of the results produced by speakers of maa
and yaa in relation to the same scenes presented in Figure 106 to taa speak-
ers.This does not mean that I am describing the relative system of the maa and
yaa, since, in the case of the Ground-sheep, I hypothesized that there would be
intrinsic strategies among the results, at least among the youngest informants.
When many answers are reported, they are ordered from the more frequent to
the less frequent across each age group (twenty informants each). When only
one response is provided, it is the only one elicited within a group, or, some-
times across both groups, as in Scene 1 below.
Observing Figure 119, the collapse of traditional ontological categories in
the domain of projective spatial relations that dominated the taa language
is immediately apparent. Gradually, the Ground-sheep acquires an intrinsic
partition of its front, back, and side regions. It is interesting to note that the
prepositional doublet of the min chain is maintained in a few specific conflict-
ing cases by maa speakers (Scenes 4, 5, 6). In Scene 4, the back of the animal
coincides with the front region of the aligned field, while in 5 and 6 the sides
of the animal are geometrically situated in the back and front regions of the
aligned field. Older maa informants in particular, who massively develop the
intrinsicsysteminrelationtotheGround-sheep,stillusethedeicticminchain’s
prepositional doublet, while the adverbial minğāy/minġād ‘(from) close to the
Observer/(from) away from Observer’ or even the adverbial doublet ğāy/ġād
‘close to the Observer/away from the Observer’ are more frequently applied.
Finally, the intrinsic system is the only one actually detectable in the yaa
group.

maa and yaa Lateral Axis
Observing the results reported in Figure 120, one perceives the progressive
imposition of the intrinsic frame of reference, practically the only one applied
by yaa speakers with the Ground-sheep/goat, not unlike all other animals,
known and unknown, that have a recognizable front/back asymmetry. In the
maa group, whose answers are heterogeneous here as well, in the case of the
inherent front part of the sheep, giddām was used by six speakers, not sur-
prisingly the younger ones, while the others preferred the neutral description
‘beside’ and the cardinal directions. The Ground-sheep still has a special sta-
tus among many maa speakers, especially the older ones, who lived through
the last years of nomadism and acquired the language from nomadic parents.

maa and yaa Motion
I briefly summarize here the prepositional strategies used in maa and yaa in
motion scenes with the relative frame of reference. Quite simply, the strategy
changes as a consequence of the selected preposition, according to the same
rules of parallelism and perpendicularity of the front/back and lateral axes of
Figure and Ground seen in the previous chapter for the intrinsic frame of refer-
ence. As for wara, it is opposed to min wara in yaa (Figure 100). Both strategies
are used alternately in maa, without neat opposition. In yaa, when Observer,
Figure, and Ground’s front/back axes are aligned, the simple preposition is
used. If not, the min compound is used. For ğanb and min ğanb, the same rules
as seen in chapter 5 apply. As for the doublet min G w-ğāy/ min G w-ğād, this
prepositional strategy does not formally change between static and dynamic
scenes.

Concluding Remarks
The tendency toward the constitution of the aligned field in arrays that are
aligned in the middle of the visual field of the Observer and whose Ground
is a symmetrical entity revealed its effects in middle-aged and young speakers.
Generally speaking, the younger generations tend to be increasingly prone to
use the intrinsic frame of reference and abandon the ternary frames. This ten-
dency has been observed in young generations across many languages (Bohne-
meyer at al. 2021).

The observation of the properties of the entities requires among the young
people a new approach, which is based on the knowledge of the functions
of many objects of modern life and no longer on the properties culturally

have no reference to traditional life. A system that involves evaluation of the
properties of every entity would affect the economy of the linguistic system in
the overwhelming complexity of the modern world. The objects of daily use
have changed, and the language of space has changed as a consequence.

opposition back region/front region of the aligned field is lexicalized by means
of the opposition gabl ‘before’/baʿd ‘after.’ Significantly, the use of these prepo-
sitions is otherwise restricted exclusively to the temporal domain in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ.15
The use of gabl/baʿd in the aligned field is nonetheless diminishing, as both
‘F is gabl G’ and ‘F is baʿd G’ can be associated withthe substrategies of trans-
lation or reflection, causing a conflict in what should designate anteriority or
posteriority. In fact, old mental and semantic structures make their effects felt
for a long time over the generations, while the system is changing. Thus, some
informants ultimately selected a different object as Ground. I asked, ‘where is
the man in relation to the tree?’ and they answered, ‘the tree is before the man.’
By selecting an asymmetrical Ground (the man) they automatically renounced
the basic requirement of the aligned field, i.e., that the Ground be symmetrical.
The communicative problem that faces the speakers in intergenerational
discourse is basically that the distinction between symmetrical objects and
other objects (and the consequent use of the aligned field) is evidently endan-
gered by the change of lifestyle. In other words, the attention to the inherent
properties of objects in the minds of the younger aṣ-Ṣāniʿ is already giving way,
slowly but relentlessly, to different geometric schemas of sedentary life.
Interestingly, the importance of the properties of objects does not entail a
wider use of the intrinsic frame of reference in the language of the elderly. In
contrast, the intrinsic frame of reference is widely observable in the language
of the young people due to the prevalence of the use of functional criteria to
classify a large number of objects of modern life and to a more restricted and
localized conception of space, perhaps due to their sedentary lifestyle.The pri-
macy of the culturally attributed properties of objects in the way the elderly
describe the spatial relations represents the strategy of selection of the more
appropriate frame of reference among the large set of possibilities that they
can choose to employ.
15
An elderly speaker from the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ used the formulation: gabl duxūl Isrāʾīl wa la baʿd
‘before the entrance of Israel or just after’ (Henkin 2010: 296–297). In particular, the more
we proceed from older to younger informants, the more we notice the disappearance of
giddām‘infrontof’fromthedescriptionof anteriorityinthetemporaldomain(as‘before’)
and the generalization of gabl to indicate the concept of anteriority in time.

The Geocentric Frame of Reference across the
Generations
Asweobservedinchapter4,intaa,geocentricspatialcompetenceisexpressed
by a cluster of conceptually contiguous strategies, including the absolute one,
based on four cardinal directions (šimāl ‘north,’ giblih ‘south,’ šarg ‘east,’ and
ġarb ‘west’),1 and the landmark-based one, in which cardinal directions are
conceptually associated with local landmarks based on their fixed positions.
Differentaltitudesabovesealevelarealsoanchoredtospecificdirectionsinthe
traditionallanguage(chapter4).Theseparticularusesareencodedinaseriesof
movement verbs (chapter 4) that are falling into disuse in the maa generation
and absent from the linguistic corpus of the yaa generation.2 Nonetheless, it is
interesting to note that in projective spatial representations on both large and
small scales, directions, regardless of the type of anchor, are always expressed
in taa by means of the names of the cardinal directions and not by expres-
sions such as ‘in the direction of the city’ or ‘in the direction of the sea.’ Such
expressions are used by some maa speakers, but are almost unavailable in the
taa corpus and never appeared as taa responses in my experiments. Indeed,
this type of expression and the use of the abstract term ‘direction’ (ittiğāh)3 are
borrowedfromstandardandeducatedregistersof Arabicandperceivedbytaa
speakers as artificial.
As we have, in fact, seen in chapter 4, the mountains, in an abstract sense,
as in a schematic drawing, are usually conceived as being located towards the
east. The wadi is thought of as oriented from north to south by default and the
sea is conceived as being located towards the west in relation to the traditional
borders of the tribal lands in the southern Negev.These results of some prelim-
inary experiments, presented in chapter 4, show that this realistic conception
of abstract geographic concepts always makes it possible to describe the direc-
1 Intermediate positions are described by combining two cardinal names, such as, for example,
šimāl-ġarb ‘north-west.’
2 However, it should be noted that, regardless of whether the anchor is based on a landmark or
a geomorphological slope, the linguistic exponents used as prepositions and adverbs in taa
daily use are only the names of the four cardinal directions.
3 The word ittiğāh ‘direction,’ comes from the root of w.ğ.h., also the root of wiğh ‘face,’ and
wağğah ‘to face, to set out toward.’

tions of landmarks in astronomical grammatical terms. In cases of concrete,
real, known objects, they are described according to the current directions of
their facets, as discussed in chapter 4.
In this chapter, I focus first on the use of cardinal directions, i.e., the absolute
substrategy of the geocentric frame of reference, as defined by Bohnemeyer
(2011), on a small scale in daily use in the three generations under examina-
tion. I will also show the distribution of different prepositional strategies in
which the geocentric frame is expressed. Then I move on to reveal the linguis-
tic effects of abstract and familiar landmarks in pictures across the generations
in experiments performed in different locations.
1
taa Geocentric Frame of Reference on a Small Scale
Cardinal directions are pervasively used in taa for small-scale location. Their
high frequency as grammatical exponents of the absolute substrategy of the
geocentric frame of reference is due, among other factors, to the fact that they
are applied in order to distinguish regions of the lateral axis, even of Ground-
objects that prime intrinsic strategies. Indeed, the projective use of ‘right’ and
‘left’ is not developed and the distinction between hands is relegated to non-
spatial, legal, and cultural designations, as mentioned above (Cerqueglini and
Henkin 2016). As noted in Cerqueglini (2015) and Cerqueglini and Henkin
(2018), the absolute strategy is applied across different varieties of traditional
Negev Arabic to all problematic cases in which the intrinsic and the relative
strategies cannot apply.
In taa, there are three criteria according to which the intrinsic and relative
frames cannot be applied. I list them here in order of decreasing frequency in
the taa corpus:
1.
The type of Ground object
2.
The type of axial layout of the spatial scene, also in relation to the per-
spective of the Observer
3.
The type of relation between Figure and Ground.4
The most common use of the absolute frame of reference was recorded in con-
texts where the Ground was an unfamiliar or relatively new object associated
with modern life. Among such objects were Ground-cow/bull and Ground-
dinosaur, which could be expected to prime the intrinsic frame of reference,
like Ground-donkey/horse. More common cases included objects associated
4 The third reason was not detected in Cerqueglini and Henkin (2018).

with modern life, such as chair/shoe/computer/phone/key, which are inher-
ently partitioned according to their functional sides, and familiar to younger
generations, yet whose asymmetries are not recognized by the elders.
Figure 121 shows average taa responses to spatial scenes that include un-
known, unfamiliar, and non-culturally salient Ground objects.The finding that
Ground-chair/shoe/dinosaur/cow do not attract the intrinsic frame of refer-
ence may be surprising to speakers of most European languages, where these
Ground-objectsaregenerallyprocessedasfunctionallyasymmetricalalongthe
front/back axis (the one explored in Figure 121). In languages such as English,
Italian, German, and French, the seat of the chair and the toe of the shoe are
generally considered the front regions of the objects, so the snouts of the cow
and dinosaur are clearly used as their front regions. The absence of an inher-
ent partition or armature in taa linguistic spatial representations with these
Ground-objects is noteworthy.These Ground-objects are all unknown or newly
acquired, the cow being the only exception.
The case of the cow is special, and has cultural implications. The cow is
the symbol of the non-Bedouin, sedentary, rural Arab society whose members
inhabit land rich in water and pastures that support the breeding of large ani-
mals that require substantial amounts food and water. There are even popular
idioms in which the term ‘cow’ and its attributes designate ignorance of tra-
ditional customs and ability to adapt to the customs of sedentary societies
when applied to a Bedouin. So, for example, a father scolding his son for hav-

asking in a colorful and expressive way if by chance his son had forgotten his
Bedouin identity. The cow is the symbol of rural society, which represents the
antithesis of the frugal, but honorable, Bedouin life.
To conclude, the functional armature of both newly acquired and cultur-
ally non-salient Ground-objects is not sufficiently focused by taa speakers and
not effective in determining projective spatial representations. Once again,
cultural rules prevail over general anatomical knowledge and geometric par-
titions.

taa Cultural Salience of Figure/Ground Interactions
Cultural salience is not limited to the type of Ground in the spatial scene, but
extends to the combination of the Ground with the Figure. In fact, if the Fig-
ure/Ground combination represented in the spatial scene is not reasonable,
salient, and culturally indexicalized, it is represented in absolute terms. This

taa Absolute Frame of Reference and Axial Constraints
In addition to the use of the absolute strategy with unfamiliar objects in any
position and unreasonable or non-functional scenes, as shown in Figure 122,
Figure 123 shows that the absolute frame of reference is used with familiar
Grounds that are (or are considered) symmetrical and inanimate, such as
Ground-stone/tree/sheep, in arrays that are not aligned with the center of the
Observer’s visual field.

This happens when Figure is located laterally in relation to Ground in the
middle of the Observer’s visual field (Scenes 1 and 4), when Figure is located in
relation to Ground in any position not aligned with any axis of the Observer
(Scene 2), or when Figure and Ground are located laterally to the Observer
(Scene 3).
To summarize these cases in a general rule, one can say that with familiar,
symmetrical inanimate Grounds, such as stone/tree/sheep, the absolute frame
of referenceis in contrastivedistributionwiththerelativealignedfield,accord-
ing to the criterion alignment between Figure/Ground/Observer.
Ground objects considered symmetrical are subject to axial conditions,
while asymmetrical Ground objects are subject to culturally recognized cul-
tural constraints on the entire scene.

taa Strategies for Absolute Frames of Reference: Contrastive
Distribution
Axial conditions in the representation of the absolute frame of reference are
also evident in the selection of the grammatical strategies according to which
it is applied. So, for example, to locate a Figure-stone east of a Ground-chair,
taa speakers can chose from an inventory of three grammatical strategies that
are not conceptually synonymous:
(1)
F+ (verb)+ preposition+ G,
az-zalamih wāgif šarg aš-šağarah ‘the man is standing east of the tree,’
(2)
F+ (verb)+ min+ preposition/adverb+ G,
az-zalamih wāgif min šarg aš-šağarah ‘the man is standing (from) east of
the tree,’ and
(3)
F+ (verb)+ min+ G+ and+ preposition/adverb,

Orientation/1
Sentence(1)isexpressedbythesimplepreposition,sentence(2)isexpressed
by a min compound, and sentence (3) is a min chain. All reported examples are
translated into English in the same way. Nonetheless, I also wanted to check
the effect on absolute representations of the same criteria found in the selec-
tion of simple prepositions and min compounds for giddām/wara/ğanb seen
in previous chapters.
First, I tested the use of simple prepositions and min compounds by means
of a tick test. The parameter tested in the experiment reported in Figure 124
is Figure/Ground’s functional or interactional orientation. The Figure is a man,
who can interact with the tree in many ways, e.g., pruning, picking fruit, gather-
ing honey or eggs from nests, collecting branches and leaves, going up to reach
an outpost, and so on.
Confronted with the stimulus sentence in Figure 124, 70% of the informants
pointed only to Scene A, while 30% pointed out that both scenes could be
described by that sentence. Next, I tested the complementary stimulus sen-
tence, i.e., the min compound. Results are shown in Figure 125.

Confronted with Figure 125, all informants pointed only to B as the correct
representation. Other analogous tests were administrated to the informants,
including a Ground that primed the absolute frame of reference (stone/tent
pole/tent cushion). The min compound marks the lack of functional ability
to interact or affordance, while the simple preposition can apply to all cases,
being neutral with regard to this parameter. The results were very consistent
with those shown in Figures 124 and 125. These findings show once again the
importance of the criterion of functional ability to interact, or affordance, seen
in all frames, attesting to the importance of not only Ground, but also of the
Figure/Ground combination in taa selection of spatial representations, even
within the absolute domain. Indeed, the Figure-objects selected in the tests
reported in Figures 124 and 125 are all familiar objects whose presence in the
scene primes in the speaker the inference of a potential interaction between
Ground and Figure.
In order to double-test the efficacy of the parameter of functional ability
to interact, I proceeded to test the criterion of Figure and Ground’s mutual
distance, another semantic component, together with Figure and Ground’s

mutual orientation, constituting interactional potential or affordance, and
therefore strengthening the cultural saliency. Results are shown in Figure 126
and 127. In Figure 126, all informants explained that both scenes were suitable
for matching with the stimulus sentence.
Responses to the test in Figure 127 show that the min compound marks a
spatial gap between Figure and Ground that is wider than the gap that would
enable them to interact. The simplex preposition can cover both cases.
I can conclude that, in the absolute frame of reference, the use of the sim-
plex prepositions can apply to all cases, without subtler distinctions, especially
expressing routine, reasonable, culturally recognized scenes, while the min
compoundssignaltheviolationof theparametersof distanceandfunctionality
consideredhere.Similarlytowhathappensregardingthefront/backandlateral
axes, the min compounds are used in the absolute frame only in the absence of
positive values for the parameters of functional ability of Figure and Ground to
interact.
Furthermore, in absolute representations the alignment or misalignment
between Figure, Ground, and Observer is also relevant to identifying the mean-
ing of different prepositional strategies, as seen in chapters 5 and 6 regarding
theintrinsicandrelativeframes,respectively.Notably,intheabsoluterepresen-

tations, Figure, Ground, and Observer’s axial alignment along the same car-
dinal axis (east/west or north/south) is calculated for the position, not the
orientation of all elements. Thus, the Observer’s visual field in itself is not rel-
evant, while the position of the Observer in relation to both other elements
is. Indeed, logically, the absolute frame is used on large scales outside visibil-
ity.
The first tick test performed to check the parameter of Figure, Ground, and
Observer’s alignment along the same cardinal axis is reported in Figure 128,
with its complementary strategy in Figure 129. In Scene A, all elements are
aligned, in the second, the Figure-man is displaced from the alignment. I tested
the simplex preposition vs. the min chain.
In the test presented in Figure 128, informants unanimously replied that
both scenes fit the stimulus sentence, while all informants pointed to Scene
A as the matching scene in Figure 129.
To summarize, min chains in absolute representations mark the alignment
of Figure, Ground, and Observer along the same cardinal axis, locating Figure
according to both Ground’s and Observer’s positions. This produces a hybrid
solution that entails semantic constituents of absolute and relative strate-
gies.

In taa, the use of min chains marks the alignment of Figure, Ground, and
Observer across all frames of reference. This means that taa speakers can also
encode the Observer’s position in absolute and intrinsic representations, and
not only in relative descriptions that are deictic by definition. I call the cases

of intrinsic and absolute strategies that entail the perspective of the Observer
‘hybrid strategies,’ i.e., ‘intrinsic-relative’ and ‘absolute-relative’ frames. The
possibilityof encodingtheObserver’sperspectiveinintrinsicandabsoluterep-
resentations is a unique feature found so far only in taa and therefore has
significant impact on the general theory of frames of reference.
Min chains signal the presence of more dimensions and perspectives. The
multidimensional factor conveyed by min stems from the fact that Ground
is indicated as a secondary source of reference, while the coordinates are
projected by the Observer. The conjunction w- connects Figure, Ground, and
Observer and iconically retraces the ideal eye-tracking process implemented
by speakers. It starts from Ground-source, in what appears to be an intrinsic
use, but then provides the definitive coordinate center that is the Observer.
Thus, for all min chains, the referential strategy is, ultimately, relative or deic-
tic.
5
Absolute Frame of Reference in Motion
According to corpus data, the three strategies described in the previous para-
graph (simple cardinal preposition, min compound, and min chain) are also
active in the domain of motion representations. I identified the rules that gov-
ern their distribution, and found that the different strategies are in contrastive
distribution in relation to axial parameters very similar, yet not identical, to
those observed for the relative and intrinsic frames.
The axial alignment between Figure and Ground along the same cardinal
axis (east/west or north/south) as a parameter for the distribution of the sim-
plex cardinal preposition vs. the min compound does not make sense in the
case of absolute representations with symmetrical and non-mobile grounds.
In cases in which the Ground is mobile, yet its orientation is not culturally rec-
ognized and its regions are partitioned astronomically, i.e., Ground-bull, the
alignment in the same cardinal direction is relevant in the selection of the sim-
plex preposition vs. the min compound, consistently with what was observed
in static scenes. The parameter of axial alignment in motion was tested with
a series of stimulus doublets designed according to the criteria of the tick test
(chapter 3) regarding motion scenes. Resultsarereported in Figures 130and 131.
In this type of test, with absolute priming Grounds, a different position of the
Observer in relation to the scene proved not to interfere in any way with the
results.
In the contrastive pair of Figures 130 and 131, above, we see that when the
Ground is conceived as symmetrical and the Figure is walking with its lateral

axis aligned along the same cardinal axis (side by side), informants choose the
simple preposition, while, when the Figure is moving, for example overtak-
ing the Ground, and its lateral axes are displaced from the alignment to some
degree during the movement, the min compound must be selected. The sim-
plex cardinal preposition, however, covers both situations.
The axial alignment of Figure and Ground along a cardinal axis can also
be front/back, as shown in the next pair of figures, 132 and 133, in which once
again I tested the opposition between the simple preposition and the min com-
pound.
However, an opposition between the simplex cardinal preposition and the
min compound is also created with the immobile Ground, in fact the most
widespread in absolute representations.The opposition is illustrated in the fol-
lowing pair of figures, 134 and 135.
Figures 134 and 135 show that when the movement of a Figure in relation to
an immobile Ground is linear along a cardinal axis, the simple preposition is
used. On the other hand, when the movement follows different directions over
a larger area, the min compound is used.The simple preposition, however, cov-
ers both cases.

possible, in order to elicit listeners’ empathy and identification. The preposi-
tion min precedes Grounds in the first part of the compound, and indicates
Ground as the starting point of the search for Figure in the direction indicated
by the next adverb.
The two sentences below are examples of free speech that apply different
strategies for route descriptions:
(1)
Kseyfihminšargas-Sabaʿ (lit.‘KsēfeisfromeastBeer-Sheva’),‘Ksēfeiseast
of Beer-Sheva,’
(2)
al-Quds min al-Ḫalīl w-šimāl (lit. ‘Jerusalem is from Hebron and north’),
‘Jerusalem is north of Hebron.’
Both sentences (1) and (2) were collected in Ligīyih and represent the applica-
tion of the semantic criterion Figure, Ground, Observer’s alignment, negative
in (1) and positive in (2). I show in a map both descriptions with reference to
Ligīyih, the place where both sentences were uttered.
In (1), the min compound cannot be applied because Figure, Ground, and
Observer are not aligned, while in (2) they are aligned. The criterion of align-
ment between Figure, Ground, and Observer is so strong that its use is not
limited to the presence of Observer and Figure at opposite ends of Ground,
as in (2). Especially in the familiar territory of the Negev/Sinai, the min chain
is also found when Observer is between Figure and Ground, as in the following
examples:

see, it is not so much the order of the alignment between Figure, Ground,

marked, but rather the pure condition of alignment among the three elements
along the same axis.
The taa absolute frame of reference encodes the semantic distinction be-
tween aligned Figure, Ground, and Observer and non-aligned Figure, Ground,
and Observer alongthe samecardinalaxis,independently of their mutualposi-
tion. This is not possible in the relative frame of reference. Here the multidi-
mensional character of min expresses the coexistence of two perspectives, the
absolute or cardinal nature of the frames of reference and the Observer’s per-
spective, in the same representation.

chapter 7
Experimental data show that in taa, projective representations based on
Ground-cities and on Ground-geographical entities prime the absolute frame
of reference (Cerqueglini 2015). The taa absolute frame of reference uses the
fourbasiccardinaldirectionsasprepositions.Giddāmisusedonlyintheintrin-
sicframeof reference,while waraisusedinbothrelativeandintrinsicframesof
reference. This strict correlation linking prepositions and frames of reference
has etymological roots and depends on taa cultural classification of Grounds.
I call it the ‘taa prepositional split’ (Cerqueglini 2017). Each G primes a specific
frame of reference and its related prepositions, on the basis of its ontological
properties in the domain of space.
In a conversational setting recorded in Ligīyih, however, I asked about a
teacher friend of mine, and was offered this description: Aḥlām sāknih fi-Sgīb
as-Salām, min Tall as-Sabaʿ w-giddām, (lit. ‘Aḥlām lives in Segev Shalom, from
Tel Sheva and in front’), i.e., ‘Aḥlām lives in Segev Shalom, in front of Tel Sheva.’
I had not expected a Ground-city to attract giddām, which is used in experi-
mental settings only with inherently shaped Grounds that prime the intrinsic
frame of reference. It seemed very strange to me that a city could be perceived
by an aṣ-Ṣāniʿ as having an intrinsic ‘front.’ But when I looked at a map, which
appears below, I understood the reasons for the use of the min chain and I
realized that giddām is used in this case within a relative frame of reference,
i.e., calculated in relation to the Observer’s position. The Observer communi-
cates to the listener an ideal navigation that takes him to the Figure through
the Ground. The min chain is used because of the alignment between Figure,
Ground, and Observer.
The visualization of the fictive trajectory indicated by the Observer to the
listener helps the listener to understand the Observer’s calculations in terms
of geographic coordinates. Here, the Observer knows that Segev Shalom is
beyond Tel Sheva, just along the same trajectory, so that Observer’s location,
Tel Sheva, and Segev Shalom are aligned along the same ideal axis, which is
actually a cardinal axis, if considered on a large scale. The use of the intrin-
sic preposition giddām is explained by the fact that aligned Figure, Ground,
and Observer facilitate the use of a relative representation. In other words,
here the Observer projected his/her own face onto the Ground, despite the
symmetrical nature of the Ground, because of the strong influence of aligned
Figure, Ground, and Observer. The use of giddām in a relative representa-
tion and with a G-landmark is a violation of the ‘prepositional split’ princi-
ple.
Moreover, from a cognitive point of view, descriptions on a geographic scale
are anchored to detailed knowledge of the territory in abstract terms, that is, of
the exact location of geographical landmarks in terms of astronomical coordi-

maa and yaa Absolute Frame of Reference
In this section, I analyze the responses provided by maa and yaa speakers to
the same stimuli submitted to the taa informants and represented in Figures
121, 122, 123. In general, as mentioned regarding the intrinsic and relative frames
of reference in the previous chapters, in this case too, the answers provided by
the maas are more heterogeneous, while yaa speakers are strongly oriented to
intrinsicresponses,withoutdistinctionbetweenculturallysalient,non-salient,
or alien animals from the contingent cultural horizon and without distinguish-
ing between culturally salient and functionally reasonable scenes and scenes
in which Figure and Ground usually do not interact, as happened in taa (see

tions reported in Figure 139, the intrinsic frame of reference is practically the

only one used by the yaa generation, without distinction between the types
of animals (familiar and unfamiliar) and other objects, and without any dis-
tinction regarding cultural salience. There are two exceptions to this general
assumption, namely Scenes 1 and 2, in which the Ground is an inanimate
object. The same four yaa informants chose the relative frame of reference
by reflection along the lateral axis in order to determine the position of the
Figure in relation to the Ground in the cases of both the Ground-chair (Scene
1) and the Ground-shoe (Scene 2). However, yaa informants demonstrate a
definite bias towards intrinsic solutions. The absolute frame of reference has
completely disappeared from the language of the yaa generation. Therefore,
regarding the younger generation, for the results on the motion scenes, the
reader can refer to what is specified in chapter 5 for the intrinsic frame of ref-
erence.
The progressive disappearance of the absolute frame of reference was per-
ceived during the experiments on the intermediate generation, in which only
the four or five older members of the group used the absolute strategies, not
consistently in all cases, and without any differential selection of simplex
preposition,mincompound,orminchain(unlikewhatisreportedfortaa).The
most neutral form of the relative frame of reference, which is based on the per-
spectiveof theObserverandexpressedbytheoppositionof ğāy‘comingtoward

quency in the most doubtful cases, such as Scenes 9 and 10, where the sheep is
not in the middle of the Observer’s visual field, but set laterally (Scene 10) and
displaced to the periphery of the Observer’s visual field (Scene 9). As we can
see from Scene 8, some speakers (two, among the oldest of the maa group) still

important observation is the word for the ‘left side’ yisār,8 which in both maa
and yaa has replaced the word šimāl~šamāl for both ‘left’ and ‘north’ used in
taa.
Regarding the experiments that involved the motion scenes with the objects
presented in this chapter for the maa generation, the cardinal directions were
applied indiscriminately as simple prepositions, min compounds, and min
chains. For the intrinsic and relative strategies, see the related observations in
the previous chapters (5 and 6).

A Note on Referential Polysemy in Prepositions
Prepositions happen to show polysemy in relation to the position of the region
with which they are associated, so an English speaker saying: ‘the cat is in front
of the car’ could be describing two different situations, which I show in Fig-
ure 140.
In Figure 140, Scene 1, the front region represented by ‘in front of’ is inter-
preted intrinsically. The front region is seen as an inherent part of the car, i.e.,
the one associated with the direction of movement. In Scene 2, the Observer
imposes his/her own perspective on the entire array, despite the existence of
inherentfacetsof theGround-car.Insuchacase,therelativeframeof reference
is used, and any part of the car (even back and sides) can be associated with the

front region. Thus, in English the different spatial meanings of the preposition
‘in front of’ depend on where the front region is projected in relation to the
Ground-object. In other words, ‘in front of’ depends upon the point of view
adopted by the speaker. If the observation’s origo is the speaker himself, any
side of the car can be the ‘front.’ If, on the other hand, the car acts as the ‘objec-
tive’ point of reference, ‘in front of’ can refer only to the functional, inherent
front of the car. Thus, the meaning of the prepositional expression ‘in front of’
depends on the frame of reference selected. According to Bowden’s (1992) the-
oretical assumptions regarding the grammaticalization of spatial prepositions
in Oceanic languages, projective prepositions such as the English ‘in front of’
and‘behind’canbedefinedaspolysemicelements,sincetheyareusedinaccor-
dance with differentframesof reference.They present‘distinctsenses [that]all
belong to the same grammatical category’ (Cablitz 2006).
Polysemy also occurs within the absolute frame of reference, in its cardi-
nal exponents. In the same language, cardinal prepositions (north/south/east/
west) can be anchored in landmarks and landmark-based prepositional arma-
tures (uphill/downhill) can be anchored in astronomical directions, as seen
across Arabic varieties in chapter 4, where I explained that prepositional pol-
ysemy in cardinal prepositions is observable in the Northwestern Ḥijāzi Ara-
bic dialectal family, to which Negev Arabic, which includes aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic,
belongs. The term giblih, meaning the direction of the prayer toward Mecca,
shifts to mean ‘south.’ This anchoring is due to the position of the tribal home-
land of Northwestern Ḥijāzi speakers, who settled north-northwest of Mecca.
The word giblih alternates freely with ğanūb≈ğinūb, ‘south’ in all Negev Arabic
dialects. In contrast, Galilean Bedouin keep the meaning of ğanūb ‘south’ and
giblih ‘Mecca’ separate, because they originate from the Syrian ğazirah/north-
eastern Arabia. Analogously, giblih also means ‘north’ in Yemenite Arabic dia-
lects, spoken south of Mecca.
Armatures based on the human body can be anchored in cardinal terms. In
thelanguageof Aymara,thehuman-body-likearmatureconstitutedby‘infront
of’ and ‘behind’ is anchored in the east/west axis. Thus, to convey the meaning
‘east of,’ the Aymara say ‘in front of,’ while to convey the meaning ‘west of,’ they
say ‘behind’ (Nuñez and Cornejo 2012).
The absolute anchoring of roots related to body parts is observable in the
Akkadian word pāni ‘front’ used for ‘east.’9 Its opposite, aḫarātu ‘west,’10 is in
9
For the meanings pāni ‘east’ and aḫarātu ‘west,’ see Qimron (1979: 43). Despite the fact
that the Akkadian pāni ‘front’ has its origin in common with frontal body parts, pāni itself
does not designate in Akkadian any part of the human body. Pāni has, in fact, the primar-
ily temporal meaning of ‘earlier, before,’ while pāniš has the meaning of ‘in front’ (Black
et al. 2000: 263).

fact not associated with body parts.11 Pāni comes from the Semitic root p.n.y.,
which produces the Akkadian pānu(m) ‘face,’ pānātu ‘fore side of the neck,’
and pānûm ‘first,’ and the Hebrew pānīm ‘face,’ li-fnē ‘before,’ and pānā ‘to
face toward.’Aḫarātu comes from the Semitic root ʾ.ḫ.r., which produces ʾaḫarē
‘behind’/‘after’ in Hebrew and ʾāḫir ‘last’ in Arabic.12
The association of ‘face’ (and ‘front side’) with ‘east’ and ‘back’ with ‘west,’
similar to what is mentioned above regarding Aymara and, in part, Akkadian,
must be very primeval in Arabic as well.13 Indeed, ‘right (hand)’ comes from
the root y.m.n. and ‘left (hand)’ from s.m.l. As mentioned above, the name for
Yemen, the southernmost land of the Arabian Peninsula, and šimāl, the Arabic
word for ‘north’ come from the same roots (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2016).
The right side comes to be associated with the south and the left side with
the north only when a person faces east, with the west behind him. The asso-
ciation of ‘face’ with ‘east,’ reflected in the etymology of the Akkadian words,
provides the anchoring point for understanding the probable secondary devel-
opment of the north/south axis, derived from the human-body-based right/left
axis in the Arabic sprachraum, where the terms for ‘east,’ šarg and ‘west,’ġarb
have no etymological connection to bodily armatures, and mean ‘sunrise’ and
‘sunset’ respectively.
taa shows contiguity between body armatures and cardinal directions in
linguistic communicative tasks carried out inside a traditional Bedouin tent.
Bedouin tents are, as mentioned above, without exception, erected with their
entrances facing east, so that ‘east’ and ‘front’ coincide in its armature. Inside

pānānu ‘before,’ and aḫarriš ‘in future’ (Black et al. 2000: 7).
11
Additional words were used in East Semitic to indicate cardinal directions, and were gen-
erally derived from the positions of natural landmarks, cities, or states, following the
Sumerian custom. According to Mateus (2009: 64), the ‘west’ and its wind were called
amurru and the east and southeast elam. The appellative ‘eastern’ was expressed by
šadiyu(m) ‘mountaineous’ from šadwu(m) ‘mountain’ (Gelb 1957: 263).
12
Akkadian has also maḫra and maḫru(m) for ‘in front of/before/earlier’ and maḫrûm for
‘first, former, earlier’ (Black et al. 2000: 191).
13
It is interesting to notice how the conflation of projective axes, like the intrinsic body-
based coordinates and the cardinal coordinates, are constant phenomena across lan-
guages, also between East and West Semitic, while the semantics of locative preposi-
tions seems to vary deeply crosslinguistically (Archi 2021). The Akkadian ana/ina/ištu are
semanticallydistantfromtheprepositionsfoundintheWestSemiticsystems,whicharein
turn internally differentiated. So, just to give an example of the differences, both the Ara-
bic min and ʿan are analogous to the Hebrew min, mi-, me- while the Hebrew ʿim, probably
a cognate of Arabic ʿan ‘away from,’ has developed the comitative meaning ‘with’ (Pennac-
chietti 1974, 2005, 2008).

the space of the tent, taa uses giddām ‘in front’ and wara ‘behind’ meaning
‘east’ and ‘west,’ respectively, to locate objects in relation to symmetrical ele-
ments of the tent furniture, such as pole/cushion (Cerqueglini and Henkin
2018).
Furthermore, in cognitive tests, the intrinsic frame of reference appeared in
some special contexts with the almost exclusively dominant absolute frame of
reference. This was due to the presence of an artificial landmark, in the form
of a cone that was intended to remind the subjects of a mountain, introduced
to them as ğabal, ‘mountain,’ suitably positioned on the experimental desks,
and called an ‘intrinsic primer,’ as in Li and Gleitman (2002), to trigger intrin-
sic responses (see chapter 8).

chapter 8
taa, maa, and yaa Cognitive Referential Framing
This chapter addresses the cross-generational comparison of cognitive rep-
resentations of static projective spatial relations in taa, maa, and yaa, i.e.,
the cognitive application of spatial frames of reference, within the traditional
Negev territories and outside of them. To summarize the linguistic situation
described so far in chapters 5, 6, and 7, taa uses the three main frames of ref-
erence described by Levinson (2003) and later re-classified into more detailed
categoriesbyBohnemeyerandO’Meara(2012).Inparticular,theintrinsicframe
isappliedalongthefront/backaxistoarestrictedsetof culturallysalient,asym-
metric Grounds (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2018), while the relative frame of
reference is applied exclusively by translation on familiar geometrically sym-
metrical Grounds (tree/stone) or Grounds culturally considered symmetrical
(sheep/goat), with Figure and Ground aligned in the middle of the Observer’s
visual field (Cerqueglini 2015). The geocentric frame of reference is applied by
the geomorphic substrategy only in a grammatically encoded set of motion
verbs (chapter 4). The landmark-based substrategy applies in context-depen-
dent conditions, with abstract mountain or wadi in the background of the
spatial Figure/Ground scene (chapter 4). Its grammatical exponents are in
any case the names of the cardinal directions šarg, ‘east,’ ġarb, ‘west,’ ğib-
lih/ğinūb~ğanūb, ‘south,’ and šimāl~šamāl, ‘north’ (chapter 4). The absolute
substrategy, applied according to the same quadruplet of cardinal directions,
is the most exploited one in both large- and small-scale representations. Abso-
lute representations are applied to establish asymmetries along the lateral axis,
since in taa ‘right’ and ‘left’ are not grammaticalized into spatial regions and
prepositions, as mentioned (chapter 4). The absolute frame of reference is
applied whenever a spatial scene entails a Figure and a Ground who cannot
interact in any functional, salient, way (a horse and a coffee pot; chapter 5);
whenthepotentialforfunctionalinteractionexists,butisnotclearlyexpressed
(a man who is moving away from a horse; chapter 7), min compounds are
applied instead, according to the selected frame and preposition. Absolute rep-
resentations are also applied for familiar, symmetric grounds in contrastive
distribution with the relative strategy, whenever Figure and Ground are not
aligned in the middle of the visual field of the Observer (chapter 7). The most
striking application of the absolute frame of reference is when the Ground is
an unfamiliar or novel object whose inherent partition is not known or cultur-
ally salient. Non-prototypical Grounds, Figure/Ground interactions, and non-
prototypical arrays are the most frequent applications of absolute strategies.

taa, maa, and yaa cognitive referential framing
373
In other words, taa linguistic frames of reference are selected on the basis of
properties culturally attributed to Ground objects, to the Figure/Ground type
of interaction, and to axial conditions that entail the alignment between Fig-
ure and Ground and between Figure, Ground, and Observer (chapters 5, 6, 7).
Furthermore, the prepositional strategies according to which all frames are lin-
guistically represented in taa are simplex prepositions, min compounds and
min chains, distributed on the basis of functional orientation; distance; align-
ment of Figure and Ground; and alignment of Figure, Ground, and Observer.
The geocentric frame of reference, with all its substrategies, in combination
with the other frames in hybrid referential styles and several scopes, seems
to be eligible to represent the taa ‘default perspective.’ ‘Default perspective’
(i.e., the unmarked perspective) is a definition coined by Bohnemeyer (2011)
to indicate the most important referential strategy in what he called referen-
tially promiscuous systems, i.e., languages whose speakers use several frames
of reference, freely shifting among them.
The attribution of the status of default perspective to the taa geocentric
frame of reference seems to be supported by the importance it has in cog-
nitive performances. Nonetheless, taa should be considered not a referen-
tially promiscuous language, but rather a referentially complementary system
(Cerqueglini and Henkin 2018), as taa speakers do not shift freely among
frames of reference, but select them according to the complex system of con-
straints described above. As for maa linguistic frames, as shown in previous
chapters,theolderinformantsof thisgroupusestrategiesmoresimilartothose
of taa informants, the intermediatepopulation often resortsto relative or tem-
poral strategies in dubious cases, and the younger informants are developing a
massive use of intrinsic relations that substitute for the absolute descriptions,
which always decrease from the older members to the younger ones until they
disappear. Among the older members of the maa group, some leftover effects
of cultural categorization remain active in some treatments of the Ground
sheep/goat (chapter 6). Interestingly, all prepositional strategies available in
taa are formally maintained in maa, yet their distribution and meanings are
quite different. For example, in maa, and even more in yaa, simplex preposi-
tions, min compounds, and min chains are interchangeable in both the static
and motion domains (chapters 5, 6, 7). Becoming redundant, min chains and
min compounds progressively disappear from static yaa. The right/left axis
is developing, and is still not stably processed according to either relative or
intrinsic strategies. In yaa, the intrinsic frame is the dominant one along both
axes, as observed in many other languages worldwide where the elderly gen-
erations prevalently used absolute strategies, while the younger ones show a
strong intrinsic linguistic bias (Bohnemeyer et al. 2022).

chapter 8
The traditional ontologies of space have made room for a more detailed,
encyclopedic knowledge of instruments, tools, navigation technologies, and
spatial organization characteristic of modern times, which contributes to a
practically exclusive application of the intrinsic frame of reference with every
object that has geometric and functional asymmetries. As far as symmetrically
geometric objects are concerned, the relative frame is used with both the rota-
tion and reflection frames, especially on the lateral axis, while the translation
strategy disappears completely. With it, the semantic effect of the alignment
between the elements of the spatial scene and the observer also disappears
from all frames, as do the min chains, from a formal point of view. The oppo-
sition between simplex prepositions and min compounds remains in yaa in
motion scenes, on the basis of axial parameters (chapters 5, 6, 7).
From the point of view of cognition, as shown in this chapter, the absolute
frame of reference is the only one available across the three generations, espe-
cially within the borders of the tribal territories, marking a notable separation
between language and cognition and a striking correlation between geocentric
cognition and landscape. This relationship between spatial language, cogni-
tion, and nature was first captured by the sociotopography approach (Palmer
2015).
The idea that our environment determines the language we speak and how
we conceptualize reality originated with B.L. Whorf (1956). In the last two
decades, Whorf’s relativistic and deterministic approach has been reconsid-
ered within the framework of the neo-Whorfian renaissance, with particular
focus on spatial language and cognition. The correlation between language
structure and environment was first codified by Palmer (2015) as the Topo-
graphic Correspondence Hypothesis. Earlier notions regarding the correlation
between geography and spatial language are found in Burenhult and Levinson
(2008), Dasen and Mishra (2010), Johnson and Hunn (2010), Mark et al. (1999),
Mishra et al. (2003), O’Meara (2010), Pederson (1993), Polian and Bohnemeyer
(2011), Smith and Mark (2003), and Wassman and Dasen (1998). Moore and
Bohnemeyer (2016) added data from Isthmus Zapotec on the interplay of spa-
tial, linguistic, and cognitive variation and topography.
Since in many Bedouin languages cardinal directions have prominent cul-
tural importance and intensive linguistic application (chapter 4), since taa
uses the absolute strategy for all doubtful and non-prototypical cases, while
intrinsicandrelativestrategiesaremainlyconfinedtoarestrictedsetof objects
and interactions, and since the absolute strategy is the only one found across
the three aṣ-Ṣāniʿ generations in cognition, I hypothesized the primacy of

Space in Universalism and Relativism: Language-to-Cognition
Correlation
The present study contributes to the debate over the relationship between
language and cognition, which is enshrined within the more complex ques-
tion regarding the universal vs. the linguistic-relative nature of concepts. Lan-
guage and nonlinguistic mental activities are undoubtedly correlated. How
and to what extent this correlation is expressed are questions not likely be
incontrovertibly solved. Languages differ in the ways in which they constrain
speakers in attending to and encoding different aspects of reality (Borodit-
sky 2006; Sapir 1921; Slobin 1996) and possibly lead to the existence of differ-
ent kinds of minds and world experiences. According to Whorf (1956), lan-
guages shape non-linguistic mental activity (habitual thought) and experience
(reality) according to their distinctive categories. Whorf’s linguistic relativity
assumes that non-linguistic representations are not innate, but rather emerge
from the use of certain linguistic expressions (Gumperz and Levinson 1996;
Levinson 1996a; 1997; Lucy 1992).This radical view has long been abandoned in
favor of light deterministic claims (Boroditsky 2001; Bowerman 1996; Davidoff
et al. 1999; Dehaene et al. 1999) and rejected by some who maintain the validity
of universal and innate concepts (Li and Gleitman 2002).
Universalism claims that cognitive and linguistic representations are largely
the same across languages and cultures, with the exception of superficial varia-
tions (Hayward andTarr 1995; Landau and Jackendoff 1993; Landau 1996; Logan
and Sadler 1996; Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976; Munnich et al. 2001; Regier
1996; Regier and Carlson 2001). The two functions are somehow linked so
that translation from one system to the other is possible (Fodor 1975; Jackend-
off 1983). Within universalism, linguistic representations are treated as truth-
conditional (Svorou 1994: 3), i.e., as representations of an ‘objective world’
that actually exists. Domains that are universally experienced yet differently
represented by speakers of different languages, e.g., space, time, grammati-
cal gender, color, shape, and substance are favorable testing grounds for this
debate between innate universal structures and language-based relativistic
constraints (Boroditsky 2006).

anisms of cross-domain semantic transposition (Lakoff 1993; Lakoff and John-
son 1980) assumed the derivation of temporal concepts from spatial ones to
be biologically determined. These speculations relied on assumptions regard-
ing the existence of spatial concepts modeled as universal intuitive categories
(Kant 1768) preceding linguistic capability and simply reflected in it. Like uni-
versalism, Kantian transcendental concepts did not assume that language had
an active role in structuring mental concepts or organizing experience.
Nevertheless, analyses of verbal, nominal, and adpositional linguistic strate-
gies of semantic representation have revealed extraordinarily wide cross-lin-
guistic variability (Mithun 1999: 142). The discovery of striking cross-linguistic
variation in the domain of space sparked renewed interest in the relationship
between language and cognition, leading to a revival of notions rooted in the
Sapir-Whorf hypothesis within new relativistic paradigms (Marotta 2010).
The non-linguistic knowledge of the environment we live in could be con-
ceptually structured in the brain according to specific salient linguistic fea-
tures. Memory, route-finding, non-verbal communication, and sensory-motor
activities should vary according to the categories encoded in the spoken lan-
guage (Jackendoff 1983; Langacker 1986).
In particular, Haviland (1979, 1993, 1998), working with the Guugu Yimithirr
community in Australia, reported that in their language, the human body is
not used as the origin of the axes in locative expressions such as in front
of/behind/right/left. Instead, cardinal directions (north/south/east/west) are
consistently used. This framing strategy was labeled the ‘absolute frame of ref-
erence’ (as in Levinson 2003) and later called geocentric. Geocentric strategies
are defined as strategies that invoke features of the external world and are
divided into those that apply absolute strategies and those that resort to land-
marks (e.g., downriver/towards the coast from the village) (Bohnemeyer and
Tucker 2010; Cooperrider et al. 2017; O’Meara and Pérez Báez 2011; Palmer et al.
2017). The idea of primitiveness, innateness, and universal availability of axial
oppositions based on the human body such as right/left and front/back axes
was no longer sustainable and had a tremendous impact on acquisition stud-
ies, which maintained the opposite.
The Guugu Yimithirr data were later compared by analogous data reported
by Brown and Levinson among Tzeltal Mayan speakers (1993a), who use the
geomorphic indicators uphill/downhill to locate objects in space. Together
with Mopan, these languages represented the first reported examples of the
fact that sensitivity to orientation across the lateral dimension of the human
body is not a necessary component of human mental activity, but rather a ‘cul-
tural [construct] facilitated by language’ (Danziger 2001: 217).
The discovery of populations that used geocentric encoding had tremen-
dous impact on behavioral, cognitive, and psychological sciences (Marotta

2013), and inspired the inception of the neo-Whorfian renaissance (Danziger
2001: 200). Levinson’s cognitive experiments (1996a, 2003) proved that linguis-
tic structures prime speakers of languages that use absolute framing to con-
stantly orient themselves and experience and memorize scenes in absolute
terms, while speakers of European languages, who do not use cardinal direc-
tions in small-scale location, do not do this. Molyneux’s long-debated philo-
sophical question (Levinson 1996b) seemed thus to have found a definitive
answer, confirmed by later studies carried out on a congenitally blind popula-
tion, which structured its world knowledge not via physical experience (visual
perception), but rather on the basis of spoken language (Marotta 2013). In the
last thirty years, many voices from different perspectives have animated the
debate on the effects of language on experience, yet the basic questions regard-
ing the possible existence of a core universal mind and the limits of linguistic
constraints (Boroditsky 2006) have not yet been comprehensively answered.
Before the discovery of languages that use geocentric framing, intrinsic and
relativeframesof referencewereregardedastheonlypossibleuniversallyavail-
able strategies, since European languages include both strategies and switch
almost freely between them. Front/back and right/left axial oppositions were
thought of as essential for human spatial processing (Clark 1973; Miller and
Johnson-Laird 1976; Olson and Bialystok 1983; Piaget and Inhelder 1956). The
development of the relative frame of reference was regarded as entailing the
previousdevelopmentof theintrinsicframeof reference,consideredthefirstto
be acquired by children (Johnston and Slobin 1979). Studies on vision (Carlson-
Radvansky and Irwin 1993; Marr 1982) confirmed the existence of perspectives
in spatial observation that exclusively represented the intrinsic or the relative
strategy (Levinson 2003: 70). The relative frame of reference was thought of as
being largely predominant, since front/back and lateral axes would be derived
from the oppositions experienced along the axes of Observer’s human body.
The order of acquisition of spatial representations was supposed to proceed
from topological relations to intrinsic and relative frames of reference, parallel-
ing the metonymical-metaphorical processes of grammaticalization described
in Svorou (1994). Grammaticalization of projective prepositions was regarded
as a process of abstraction from concrete lexical meanings to extensively appli-
cable relational meanings, a semantic change that proceeds along predictable
paths of universal cross-linguistic tendencies (Svorou 1986, 2003; Heine 1997).1
1 Elements of analogy and conceptual contiguity between intrinsic and relative frames of
reference are still being debated, with special attention to anchoring strategies (Danziger
2010). In the intrinsic frame of reference, Anchor=Ground, in the relative frame of reference,

Typologies of Referential Styles
To test the hypothesis of similarity between linguistic and cognitive represen-
tations, languages have been classified typologically as predominantly relative-
framing, intrinsic-framing, or absolute-framing. The dominant frame of refer-
ence in language has repeatedly been proven to appear in cognitive responses
(Levinson 2003). Since in cognition one frame of reference seemed to always
be largely and clearly prevailing, the presence of more than one frame of ref-
erence within a language has been conceptually explained by postulating that
oneframeof referencehastobedominantineverylinguisticgroup,asa‘default
perspective,’ and this is the frame of reference that affects the cognitive expe-
rience.
The existence of multiple referential strategies in a single language is at-
tested to—for intrinsic and relative frames of reference—by the tradition of
studies on language acquisition in Western languages (Piaget and Inhelder
1956; Talmy 1983; Landau 1996, 2010). The definition of default perspective is
invoked to conceptually reconcile the existence of multiple referential strate-
gies in a single language and the deterministic influence of language on the
cognitive level.
Levinson invokes situation-based selection, leaving open the question of
whether it is due to task-specificity or, rather, to selective criteria other than
tasks. ‘In the case where more than one frame of reference is available, one
may find one frame of reference preferred for one situation, and another for
another situation’ (Levinson 2003: 179). In fact, Levinson proposes that task-
specificity affects the selection of referential strategies to different extents in
different languages:
In certain cases, like Tzeltal and Guugu Yimithirr … the linguistic re-
sources are very constrained … Tzeltal only uses the intrinsic/topological
system for objects close in space. In other cases, though, classifying com-
munities by linguistic resources as opposed to language use will give a dif-
ferent typing—for example in English or Dutch, both relative and intrin-
sic framesof referenceareavailableandcolloquially used,buttherelative
frame is clearly predominant for most kinds of spatial description.
2003: 179
1997; Li and Gleitman 2002; Mishra et al. 2003; Wassman and Dasen 1998), or Anchor=Lis-
tener. Levinson (2003) proposes a new subdivision in which the relative frame of reference
only defines those cases where Ground≠Observer. Thus, ‘the ball is in front of me,’ formerly
considered relative, is intrinsic in Levinson (2003), because Ground=Observer, i.e., the strat-
egy is binary (Figure; Ground/Observer).

According to Tversky (1996), the actual employment of one or another of
the frames of reference depends on the properties of the task, e.g., the scale of
the things to be described, the use of the information, and so on. Nevertheless,
many different referential systems have been described whose complexity is
not reducible to the hypothesis of one dominant default perspective in each
language selected among the three main referential strategies. The complex-
ity of type-mixing referential styles (or ‘referentially promiscuous languages’)
(Bohnemeyer 2011) has opened up new perspectives for the study of the devel-
opment, conceptual contiguity, and contextual selection of referential strate-
gies beyond typological classification and deterministic claims.

Methodology of Cognitive Enquiry
In cognitive tests, the question under experimental review was whether differ-
encesinthespatiallinguisticpatternspredicteddifferencesincognitiveperfor-
mance.Informantswererequestedtoperformtheirresponsesinnon-linguistic
ways, i.e., by manipulating the stimuli. Each informant was tested separately.
Here I report and discuss only the outcomes of the experiments of the
Reconstruction and Recall types. The memory tasks in the tests, which I per-
formed in accordance with the design in Levinson (2003), revealed some pecu-
liarities that deserve to be treated more extensively in a different work and
will not be discussed here. Reconstruction tests were performed using three-
dimensional toy objects, while recall tests were performed using pictures.
My basic methodological pattern was the rotation paradigm, described in
BrownandLevinson(1993a),Pedersonetal.(1998),LiandGleitman(2002),and
Levinson (2003). According to this paradigm, between stimulus and response,
the informant is rotated by 90° or 180°.
3.1
Reconstruction Task: The Mountain
The animals-in-a-row reconstruction task (Pederson et al. 1998) was performed
with toy objects. The cultural reasons for avoiding tests using chips, cards, and
two-dimensional objects are extensively explained in Cerqueglini (2015) and
Cerqueglini and Henkin (2016, 2018). In taa, two-dimensional representations
of entities have different semantic properties than three-dimensional entities.
The three animals were a horse, a sheep, and a cow, selected on the basis of taa
linguistic results as belonging to three different ontological classes in the tra-
ditional domain-based spatial classification described in the previous chapters
devoted to taa linguistic referential practices. The informants memorized the

mals were then removed from view. After 40 seconds’ delay, the subjects were
turned around or escorted to Table B, oriented differently by 90° and by 180°.
There, the subjects were handed the three original animals in random order
and asked to position them ‘in the same way as before.’
In such tests, responses may be of relative or absolute types. The 180° rota-
tion paradigm tests of relative vs. absolute responses are shown in Figure 141. If,
onTable A, the animals had their snouts facing north, which happened to be to
the right of the informant facing the stimulus, s/he could have set up the ani-
mals on Table B still facing north, the absolute solution, or still facing her/his
right, the relative solution.
3.2
Reconstruction Task with Mountain-Like ‘Landmark-Based Primer’
In order to test the effects of the intrinsic frame of reference, the 90° rota-
tion paradigm was applied in combination with the condition called ‘Relative
Ducks’/‘Absolute Ducks’ described in Li and Gleitman (1999). I call this condi-
tion the ‘intrinsic primer.’ The intrinsic primer consists of an object that is not
inherently oriented, in Li and Gleitman (1999) a pair of toy ducks.
I designed two identical brown cones, each 30cm tall, with a base diameter
of 20cm. They appear in Figure 142 seen from above. The cones were placed on
both Tables A and B before the beginning of the experiment.
The landmark-based primer had to be positioned on one side of the infor-
mant on Table A and on their opposite side on Table B. For example, the
landmark-based primer was on the informant’s left on Table A and on their
right on Table B. In the original protocol, doing this prevents the elicitation of
relative and intrinsic responses that are the same. Indeed, after 90° rotation,

the landmark-based primer will also be found in a different cardinal direc-
tion in relation to the informant. The procedure is identical to that used in the
experiment described after 180° rotation. The layout of the experiment after
90° rotation is illustrated in Figure 142.
As Figure 142 shows, the presence of the primer makes it possible to dis-
tinguish between the three basic referential strategies. Nevertheless, I decided
to perform all the tests using both the classic version, without an intrinsic
primer, and the version that includes it. In fact, the presence of the intrin-
sic primer actually elicited different responses even in some of those speakers
who responded geocentrically in the basic reconstruction task after 180° rota-
tion.

Linguistic experiments demonstrated the impact of salient landmarks in taa

picture showed the relative response, a second showed the absolute response,
and the third was a distractor. Figure 143 reports the first attempted layout of
this experiment.
Here, in the stimulus section, the informant was facing west and saw a pic-
ture containing a wadi and a man next to its bank. According to the actual ori-
entation of the experimental setting, the informant saw the wadi flowing from
south to north, from her/his left to her/his right, with the man standing beyond
the wadi, to the west. The direction of the wadi’s flow was represented in the
picture by a slanting slope that descended from south to north in the stimulus’s
setting. The wadi was closer to the informant and the man was farther away.
In the response section, the picture with the relative response shows the
wadi still closer to the informants than the man and still flowing from the infor-
mant’s left to his/her right. The astronomically-anchored geocentric response
shows the man still standing west of the wadi, which still flows from south to
north, following the descent of the slope in the picture. The distractor shows
the river flowing from north to south as it actually does in the Negev, and the
man still east of it.
A first experimental round was fundamental for the insertion of the land-
mark-based response. Indeed, in an early phase of the fieldwork, some infor-
mants—mainly women—in fact chose as the correct answer a picture meant
to be the distractor.

The distractor showed what I thought was an inconsistent picture, ignor-
ing both relative and geocentric orientations. Once I asked these informants
to defend their choices, they said that the main wadis in their territory flowed
from north to south. It was then that I noticed that these informants anchored
the picture of the wadi to the actual direction of flow that they were used to. I
consider this response to be an application of the landmark-based substrategy
of the geocentric frame of reference. Next, I designed the experiment, inserting
a picture that contained a landmark-based response in the response table. The
final layout can be seen in Figure 144.
3.4
The Recall Test with the Intrinsic Primer: The Mountain and the Wadi
The layout of the picture experiment after 90° rotation is shown in Figure 145.
Designing the recall task after 90° rotation and in the presence of the intrin-
sic primer was particularly difficult and challenging. As shown in Figure 145,
the task includes the recognition of the stimulus among four different possible
responses, including the landmark-based response and the intrinsic response,
for whose detection this type of experiment was originally designated.
The main reason that I insisted on performing the recall experiment after
90° rotation was that geographic elements are inherently shaped and, in many
cases, have proper intrinsic armatures. I wanted to test possible cognitive
effects of such an inherent partition in intrinsically framed responses.
Salient objects, such as tents and natural elements, have a double referen-
tial nature, intrinsic and absolute in taa, with a strong prevalence of the for-

mer in topological representations and the latter in projective representations
(Cerqueglini 2015). The results of the recall test after 90° rotation were positive
in this respect and showed some intrinsic effects.
An evident element of complexity in the design of the recall test after 90°
rotation was the mountain-like primer. Indeed, its location proved to conflict
in many cases with the geographic elements represented in the pictures. Due
to its shape and color, my conic intrinsic primer was commonly associated by
taa informants with a mountain, therefore indicating the east, especially out-
side the tribal territory.The east is indeed the direction in which mountains are
to be found from the perspectiveof the taa focal homeland, i.e., towardJordan.
As in the reconstruction tasks, the primer could be reframed as the anchor
of a landmark-based frame of reference, inspired by the actual geographic lay-
out of the Negev. The conflict between the primer and the geographic element
in the picture is made evident by the fact that both were demonstrated else-
where to be suitable in representing a landmark to establish an absolute ori-
entation. Some informants ultimately looked among the responses for the one
that seemed more suitable for representing the actual facts, for example the
actual relative position of mountain and wadi, ignoring the request and the
relationship between response and stimulus, as shown in Figure 146.
Despite the fact that the recall test after 90° rotation has so far shown evi-
dent experimental pitfalls, producing answers that cannot be considered in
the computation of taa cognitive referential strategies as such, the responses

perception and conception of space of what can still be considered a Natur-
volk. Such responses shed light on the taa speakers’ background knowledge of
space and routine orientation, which clearly appears to be deeply enshrined in
the physical configuration of their home territory. The background memory of
the tribal lands and their geography is revealed in the experimental responses,
which indicate that the possibility of a mountain and a river being positioned
relatively to each other differently from the way such entities are positioned
in the familiar environment is unconceivable. This probably happens because
the strong tendency toward the absolute orientation primes the interpretation
of any abstract or artificial landmark as a real one. In particular, in the case of
a symmetrical mountain-like cone, its orientation can be provided by those of
actually experienced and familiar mountains.
Furthermore, the recall task after 90° rotation was solved intrinsically by a
minority of informants—three women—attesting to the minuscule effects of
intrinsic armatures in projective relations that include landmarks. For these
reasons, I decided to include the description of the recall task after 90° rota-
tion in this section, but below I will relate only to the data that refers to the
recall task after 180° rotation.

chapter 8
types of geocentric responses that were impossible to capture with the
available design. The only option was to test in a location (Kerak) where
local topographical references are the opposite of those in Ligīyih. In
Kerak, the experiments were performed in a room with an open window
that faced west, toward the Seʿīr Mountains. It was particularly impor-
tant to test frames of reference on both the eastern and western sides of
the Seʿīr Mountains, as they are located east of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ tribal lands
(Negev) and are used as synonymous with ‘east,’ so that in taa ‘going (up)
toward the mountains’ means ‘going east’ (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2016).
I wanted to observe how aṣ-Ṣāniʿ speakers respond when the Seʿīr Moun-
tains are found to the west, as is the case in Kerak, i.e., how taa, maa,
and yaa resolve this paradox, as they all use cognitive geocentric strate-
gies anchored in the Seʿīr Mountains as the eastern reference within their
tribal lands around Ligīyih.
3.
In Tel-Aviv, about 110km outside the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ tribal lands, to the north,
with the sea in sight. Tel-Aviv is outside the tribal lands, yet ideally still to
the west in relation to the eastern mountainous area.
These different testing location conditions were inspired by the ‘blinds-down
condition,’ the ‘blinds-up condition,’ and the ‘outdoors condition’ described in
Li and Gleitman (1999). Pilot surveys indeed showed salient differences in lin-
guistic experiments performed within and outside of the tribal lands, in the
different locations mentioned.
I had previously noticed that many maa and all yaa speakers tend to use
linguistic and cognitive geocentric frames of reference only within the tribal
lands, where visible landmarks are consistently associated with the cardinal
directions. In contrast, taa speakers use the cardinal directions proficiently
everywhere, even outside of the tribal lands. Indeed, in the past, taa speakers
traveled long distances across the Sinai, Negev, and Jordan, and thus are famil-
iarwiththeirdesertlandscapes.Youngerspeakerswerebornwithinasedentary
milieu and the younger they are, the less proficient they are at geocentric ori-
entation. As taa, maa, and yaa are age-based varieties of the same tribal lan-
guage, it seems that the differences in their geocentric referential practices are
not language-related, but rather the effect of different levels of acquaintance
with the desert landscape, the result of different lifestyles, in agreement with
the sociotopography model (Palmer 2015).
The three locations were selected on the basis of the results of the linguis-
tic survey seen in chapter 4, where abstract representations of mountains are
by default associated with the eastern direction, based on the actual posi-
tion of the mountains as seen from the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ tribal lands, and thus produce
landmark-based representations.

The hypothesis was, then, that in all generations the presence of geograph-
ical elements ascribable to a direct ‘embodied’ local and routine experience
would prime the selection of the locally anchored cardinal system, based on
the adaptive memory developed by the community through its direct expe-
rience of its inhabited territories. Thus, I set out to test whether the intrinsic
primer mountain would prime landmark-based cognitive representations in
all selected locations. In total, each informant took six texts, with and without
the intrinsic primer, in three locations. For each one of the six tests, I collected
three responses from each informant, after having proven them in a series of
six trials.

were no available locations with a river flowing toward the north (contrary to
the default taa southward conception) in sight, contradicting the routine con-
ception of the direction of the wadi’s flow. Here I also set out to test whether
all generations conceived the wadi in abstract terms on the basis of the rou-
tine experience of the local landmark. In total, each informant was tested on
two recall tests, with and without intrinsic primer. For both tests, I collected
three responses from each informant, after having proven them in a series of
six trials.

taa, maa, and yaa Responses
This section presents the responses given in each of the four tests described
in the methodological section by the taa, maa, and yaa generations over all
testing locations in synoptic tables.
4.1
Basic Reconstruction Test in the Three Locations
Responses from the three experimental settings are provided in percentages in
Table 6 for the basic reconstruction task after 180° rotation. The results shown
here refer exclusively to the axis formed by the three toy objects, without ref-
erence to the orientation of each of them. Some considerations regarding this
aspect are discussed at the end of the paragraph.
taa showed the exclusive application of the absolute frame of reference,
without relevant differences within or outside of the tribal lands. Absolute
responses were elicited across all generations within the boundaries of the
tribal lands. As for the two locations outside the boundaries of the familiar
landscape, the results must be discussed in more detail.
The results of Ligīyih and Kerak reported in Table 6 are consistent with the
data presented for the same locations in Cerqueglini (2022). The most striking
fact is certainly the confidence with which taa informants recognized the car-
dinal directions from every location, regardless of the presence or absence of
familiar horizons and landmarks.
The absolute responses of the yaa informants are also striking, as yaa infor-
mantsdonothavegeocentricstrategiesinlanguage.Thethirdsurprisingaspect
is that within the tribal territories, within the familiar horizons, all three gen-
erations orient themselves in geocentric terms, while outside the usual spaces,

maa and yaa seem to lose their geocentric competence, probably because, in
fact, it is linked to knowledge of the territory, that is, anchored to familiar land-
marks.
It is interesting to add some further details from the raw materials. In Karak,
the same Seʿīr Mountains seen to the east in Ligīyih are seen to the west. This
situation can confuse the speakers or, on the contrary, help them, depending
on their own territorial competence.While taa men and women all responded
in the same absolute way, it is interesting to note how the majority of the maa
landmark-based and relative strategies elicited in Karak come from the female
sector of the maa informants. The yaa landmark-based responses, equal in
number to the relative responses, attest to the fact that, irrespectively of the
position of a landmark, it is nonetheless used as reference by yaa speakers.
Indeed, in this type of test performed according to the basic methodology,
there is no direct way to distinguish between geocentric substrategies, and only
through the informants’ explanations of their choices after the session could I
understand the rationale behind their behavior and the geocentric substrategy
detected. After the sessions, I asked each informant: ‘Why did you arrange the
scene in this way?’ In the case of the landmark-based strategy, the informants
said: ‘Because the mountains are on the [eastern/western] side,’ or ‘I oriented
the scene in relation to the direction of the mountains.’
The data of the test performed in Tel-Aviv have not been presented previ-
ously and they add to our understanding of the evolution of aṣ-Ṣāniʿ spatial
cognition across the generations. It is noteworthy that maa absolute represen-
tation dropped to 20% of the total, while relative responses increased by 10%.
Landmark-based responses increased by 5%, based on the direction of the sea,
seen outside the window of the setting location, in my former office on the Tel-
Aviv University campus.
As for the orientation of the three toy objects (horse/sheep/cow), which
belong to different ontological categories in the domain of space in taa and
were maintained across generations for the sake of consistency, in general, taa
informants paid greater attention to the direction in which the horse faced in
the stimulus scene, not only to its position in relation to the other toy objects,
than to the direction in which the sheep and the cow were facing. taa infor-
mants also paid greater attention to the position of the horse in relation to the
sheepandcowthantothepositionof thesheepandcowinrelationtotheother
elements of the scene. In some taa responses, the sheep’s and cow’s positions
were switched. Two examples of these kinds of responses from the experimen-
tal sessions are reported here.

spatial ambits and different cognitive processes. Indeed, I have shown that
Figure and the relationship between Ground and Figure also have effects on
the determination of the referential strategy to be applied, also based on cul-
tural parameters. This fact strongly supports the primeval nature attributed by
a number of scholars (Johnston and Slobin 1979; Carlson-Radvansky and Irwin
1993; Marr 1982) to the intrinsic with respect to relative representations and is
confirmed by the existence of prevalently intrinsic-framing languages, such as
those of the Mayan and Totonacan linguistic families (O’Meara and Pérez Báez
2011). Both maa and yaa treat all objects in the same way, paying increasing
attention across the generations to the inherent partition of all toy animals,
without distinctions between horse, sheep, and cow, as seen above regarding
linguistic representations.
As I mentioned in the methodology section, above, for each test, three
responses were elicited from each informant, corresponding to three different
arrays of the same toy animals. One of these arrays was aligned in the middle of
the informant’s visual field, i.e., perpendicular to the right/left axis of the infor-
mant, as axial constraints also proved to affect taa linguistic representations,
and I thought its cognitive effect should also be tested for comparison. In this
case, the orientation of the sheep was memorized and handled with the same
accuracy as that of the horse.

Reconstruction Test with Primer in the Three Locations
The 180° rotationparadigmwasapplied toexperimentallydistinguishbetween
absolute and relative performances. Since, in language, taa speakers use the
intrinsic frame of reference with some Grounds, cognitive tasks were adapted
to highlight possible intrinsic representations as well. As reported, the primer
wasinsertedintotheexperimentallayoutincombinationwiththe90°rotation
paradigm, following the experimental procedure of Li and Gleitman (2002). In
these tasks, too, I included toys from all ontological types tested as Grounds in
the linguistic experiments, proceeding according to partitions in language and
different axial conditions.
Within the Negev, all informants ignored the presence of the primer. Yet the
presence of salient landmarks outside the boundaries of the tribal lands, with
the eastern heights in sight, primed the use of landmark-based strategies, con-
sistently with the linguistic tests presented in chapter 4 for the conception of
abstract mountains.
The mountain-like primer was set once in the same actual direction of the
mountains from the testing location (to the east in Ligīyih, to the west in Karak,
and to the east-southeast in Tel-Aviv). In the second test, the mountain was set
intheoppositeposition.Inthethirdtask,themountainwassetalongtheoppo-

The primer had interesting effects outside the tribal lands. In Karak, maa
absolute responses were almost only elicited when the mountain-like primer
was in the same direction as the actual mountains. When the mountain-like
primer was set on the opposite side or along the north/south axis, maa infor-
mants were quite puzzled, as some of them sensed the actual position of the
mountains and the conflict between real mountains and primer was confusing.
In Tel-Aviv, outside the morphological east/west slope that connects Ligīyih
and Karak, landmark-based responses based on the position of the primer
increased notably, since any kind of conflict was avoided because the real
mountains were clearly not considered as a reference of any kind. yaa results
included only landmark-based and relative responses, with a large predom-
inance of relative responses in Karak, probably due to the conflict between
actual mountains and mountain-like primer in two of the three tests. There
were no absolute responses.

Basic Recall Test
The basic recall test consisted of showing the informants pictures that con-
tained symmetrical and asymmetrical objects and the cascade of a wadi. The
cascade was designed to clearly indicate the direction of the river flow. As
described in the methodology section, informants were asked to observe the
picture and after a time delay to pick up the ‘same picture’ from Table B, after
180° rotation. On Table B, three possibilities were ready: absolute, relative, and
geomorphic. An abstract representation of a wadi, such as that represented in
a drawing in the stimuli designed for this experiment, attracts a geomorphic
strategy in taa linguistic experiments, as seen in chapter 4, with the wadi con-
ceived as steadily oriented from north, its point of origin, to south, the place

where it ends. Thus, I set out to test the possible cognitive implications of this
conceptual structure revealed in language. The experiments were then per-
formed on all generations, for the sake of consistency and comparability. Each
informant was tested on three spatial scenes that included a wadi.
The results show that the absolute frame is the one applied most often, as
in fact the wadi is not utilized as frequently as the mountain in traditional
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ representations of space. As for maa, it is interesting to note that
mainlymenusedthegeomorphicstrategy,consistentlyorientingthewadifrom
north to south and establishing a spatial field in consequence of this abstrac-
tion. Indeed, maa women, who were not part of the migratory lifestyle and
not all educated, are less familiar with the broad geographical picture of the
Middle Eastern region, with the main drainage basin running along the Jor-
dan Valley from north to south. As mentioned in chapter 4, the north/south
axis across the Levant became more relevant in recent times, after the cre-
ation of the state boundaries and the migration of many Bedouin men toward
the north in search of employment. Furthermore, women are more familiar
with the local horizon and landmarks and small, local, seasonal wadis that are
formed by the rains and quickly disappear running in all directions and are
absorbed by the earth into small muddy plateaus. Thus, in maa, based on the
experienceof thelocalhorizon,thewadiisnolongerabstractlyassociatedwith
the north/south axis, but considered concretely, according to each individual
case.
As the test was taken only in Ligīyih, also among yaa informants, absolute
responses were quite numerous, while the relative dominated in terms of per-
centages.The geomorphic wadi-based system projected on abstract wadis is no
longer available among the younger generations.

In taa, mountain and wadi attract different geocentric substrategies, yet
the absolute strategy largely prevailed in ambiguous cases. The geomorphic
referential value of the wadi decreased significantly in maa and is no longer
observable in yaa, while relative strategies were more usually selected by maa
in ambiguous cases. Interestingly, the intrinsic response was largely adopted by
yaa informants when they observed the position of the mountain and the wadi
in relation to each other and the spatial field that these positions established
for the entities contained in the scene.

Discussion
As for the reconstruction task, which focused on the exploration of the cogni-
tive frames of reference and the landmark-based substrategy connected with
the mountain’s fixed position, despite the fact that stimuli were selected ac-
cording to the semantic distinctions and features that in taa language elicited
the application of the three frames of reference, in the cognitive experiments
only the absolute frame of reference was demonstrated to prevail to a great
extent within the tribal lands and outside of them. Across the maa and yaa
generations, absolute strategies are replaced by landmark-based and relative
strategies, especially outside the tribal lands, where the absence of the familiar
landscapes makes it difficult to apply cardinal directions.
Results show that taa speakers can apply the geocentric frame of reference
in cognition according to absolute, landmark-based (with the mountain-like
trigger), and geomorphic (with the wadi) substrategies, consistently with the
linguisticresultspresentedinchapter4,wheretheabstractmountainandwadi
attracted fixed coordinate systems based on the experience of the position of
the local landmarks. Landmark-based strategies outside the tribal lands are
mainly produced by women, especially maa speakers, who are no longer used

to migrations and largely remain within the boundaries of the tribal lands.
Within the tribal lands, the presence of the actual geographic landmarks con-
flicted with the presence of the mountain-like primer, which was then ignored.
The gender-based divergence in the maa treatment of the north/south axis
reveals the increasing social segregation of maa women in modern times com-
pared to taa men and women, who are very homogeneous in their spatial
competence, reflecting the premodern social equality of the traditional non-
hierarchical nomadic society.
Therelationshipbetweenlanguageandcognitionisdifficulttodefinewithin
each of the three generations of aṣ-Ṣāniʿ speakers examined here. taa has a
variety of strategies that depend on the type of Ground, the type of potential
functional interaction between Figure and Ground, and axial constraints, and
the type of task, as seen in the use of abstract landmarks in the backgrounds
of scenes. In cognition, however, taa speakers apply only geocentric strate-
gies, usually absolute, with some landmark-based and geomorphic exceptions
in tests homologous to the linguistic ones that produced the same responses.
It may be said that the geocentric frame is the most frequently used, and is
certainly the default strategy for taa speakers. Nonetheless, the relationship
between language and cognition is complex. My impression is that frames of
reference are not used in parallel in language and cognition tout court, but
rather that the semantic elements that constitute the referential choices oper-
ate both in language and in cognition. These elements are specificity with
respect to the task, type of Ground, type of Figure/Ground interaction, and
various conditions of alignment between Figure and Ground and between Fig-
ure, Ground, and Observer, described in the language by means of different
prepositional strategies. These constituent semantic elements, which I define
as ‘sememes,’ also emerge in the cognitive experience, where the alignment
with the Observer draws attention to the orientation of the toy sheep, con-
sidered symmetrical in language. Attention to criteria of axial alignment in
combination with geocentric referential strategies has also been observed in
other prevalently geocentrically framing languages, such as Tzeltal (Mayan)
(Brown and Levinson 1993a) and Gawwada (Ethiopian) (Tosco 2009).
Furthermore, in maa and yaa, the massive presence of absolute cognitive
representations is surprising, and in yaa language they are absent. Even more
interesting is the inability of the younger members of the maa group and the
all members of yaa to use the absolute frame of reference outside the tribal
territories, since its anchorage is landmark-based. Bohnemeyer’s observations
regarding the weakness of the relationship between linguistic and cognitive
strategies in linguistic referential systems that include multiple frames of ref-
erence (2011) are confirmed in taa, which can be considered a ‘referentially

complementary system,’ as the three frames of reference are in complemen-
tary distribution in language (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2018).
The studies of Le Guen (2011) and Bohnemeyer (2011) on Yucatecan Maya
seem to clearly support the separation of linguistic and cognitive concepts
in favor of less deterministic theories, such as Slobin’s ‘thinking for speaking’
(1996), according to which the effects of language on thought are observable
only in those conceptual structures directly involved in the communication of
knowledge (linguistic thought).This assessment is also in agreement with Lan-
dau’s experimental hypothesis (2010) on the early differentiation of linguistic
from non-linguistic thought due to divergent tasks.
The geocentric strategies can certainly be considered the taa ‘default,’ and
are widely represented in linguistic and cognitive tasks. This fact supports the
hypothesis that the taa object-based system used to select referential strate-
gies,thematchingof oneframeof referencewithdifferentgrammaticalexpres-
sions, and the landmark-oriented anchoring of the geocentric frame of refer-
ence all represent innovations in the language in relation to an original, abso-
lute referential system that is preserved in pan-Bedouin cultural data and still
dominates cognitive processes.
According to Bohnemeyer et al. (2014), since the geocentric frame of refer-
ence extends across many linguistic families around the world and is also the
most exploited strategy among cognitive systems of speakers of referentially
promiscuous languages, it can be considered a universally available strategy
(a ‘pan-simian bias for absolute orientation,’ Bohnemeyer et al. 2014) that was
later superseded by other referential strategies. The primeval nature of geo-
centric spatial representations has also been acknowledged in ancient Indo-
European languages (Bartolotta 2018) and supported by new studies on lan-
guage acquisition. Indeed, contrary to the hypothesis according to which chil-
dren’s spatial representations are primarily egocentric, the most recent results
on spatial language acquisition similarly suggest that children initially exhibit
a strong bias toward absolute rather than relative frames of reference (Shuster-
man and Li 2016).
Traces of saliency of the criterion of symmetry in cognitive tests may attest
to the potential development of the relative frame of reference in cognition by
means of language. In other words, before a frame of reference is structured
in cognition, the distinctive elemental criteria that are correlated to its use in
language appear. The cognitive mind is potentially open to all kinds of linguis-
tic influences, i.e., it can develop any type of referential strategy ever found
among human beings. Indeed, in line with deterministic claims, language is
assumed to shape cognition. Therefore, linguistic innovations are assumed to
modify cognitive structures over time.

I support the claim of Peterson et al. (1996) and Landau (2010) that language
may intervene only to a limited extent in structuring human spatial concep-
tions and perceptual and cognitive processes, since spatial cognition is con-
ceived as independent from language. As Landau affirms (2010), linguistic and
nonlinguistic abilities and mental structures or ‘concepts’ differ according to
function specificity. Perfectly identical conceptual doublets of language and
cognition would be redundant, i.e., they would contradict the functional econ-
omy of the conceptual system.
Peterson’s and Landau’s positions are comparable to older relativistic and
lightly deterministic assumptions made by Boas, Jakobson, and Slobin. Boas
articulatedtheconceptof ‘obligatorinessof expression,’accordingtowhichthe
set of obligatory grammatical categories of a language only ‘determines those
aspects of each experience that must be expressed’ (Boas 1938: 127). Jakobson
followed him, stating that ‘[t]he true difference between languages is not in
what may or may not be expressed but in what must or must not be conveyed
by the speakers’ (Jakobson 1959: 142). Finally, consistently with later discover-
ies made by Landau (2010), Slobin observes the existence of a special ‘kind of
thinking, intimately tied to language’ (Slobin 1996: 75) and notes the dynamic
priming function of the acquired language with regard to this particular cogni-
tive device (‘thinking for speaking’ theory). taa data definitely speak in favor
of the original light deterministic version of the language-to-cognition correla-
tion.
Asforthecausesof linguisticandcognitivechange,cognitivelinguisticstud-
ies (Li and Gleitman 2002) emphasize that the acquisition of writing prac-
tices can significantly enhance the right/left distinction, as can driving cars
and moving along the geometric paths of urban spaces rather than individ-
ual trajectories. The impact of linguistic contact on spatial representations is
clear (Calderón et al. 2019). After 1948, Negev-Arabic-speaking people grad-
ually became multilingual in Standard Arabic, Palestinian koineized Arabic,
Hebrew, and European languages such as English, German, or Italian, whose
semantic features are similar to those shown here for taa. The transition to
sedentarism also contributed to these changes. According to Brown (2006b),
the acquisition of specific spatial linguistic (and cognitive) strategies is greatly
influenced by a consistent cultural organization of space in every aspect of
life. The abandonment of traditional garments with their right/left symmetri-
cal decorative patterns and the interaction with new technologies, telephones,
computers, cars, and electrical appliances primed the extension of the intrin-
sic frame of reference from a restricted set of Gs in taa to more general-
ized and intensive use in yaa. Ultimately, while taa referential and preposi-
tional strategies are based more on cultural criteria than on geometric and

metrical features, the opposite is true for yaa, which is similar to sae languages
spoken in the globalized world.
The effects of the post-1948 abandonment of nomadic pastoralism irre-
versibly altered the community’s interaction with its familiar topography. The
generational gap between tna and yna shows how material culture, formal
education, and lifestyle modify the semantics of space and the way it is experi-
enced within the same language (Lum et al. 2022; Schlossberg 2018). Indeed, it
is clear that the styles and forms of the interaction between society and topog-
raphy reflect the causes of referential preferences (Palmer et al. 2017).

Temporal Cognition across the Generations
1
From Space to Time in Language and Cognition
Premodern, non-Western, traditional, and indigenous conceptualizations of
time may be represented according to many different models: a linear passage
from the past to the present and towards the future, or a spiral, a branch, a tri-
angle, or a cycle (Reid and Sieber 2016). In the Māori tradition in New Zealand,
the concept of time is represented in the Koru symbol of the double spiral
where ‘each circumambulation of the spiral incorporates the past into both
the present and the future and, in doing so, reconstitutes both’ (Murton 2011:
82). In the Lake Titicaca area of South America, Aymara language and culture
has a unique conception of time. Contrary to most conceptions, in Aymara,
the past, which is known, is conceived as being in front of people, where it
is visible; whereas the unknown future is behind them (Núñez and Sweetser
2006). In all these cases, time is represented in spatial terms (Casasanto and
Boroditsky 2008; Lakoff and Johnson 1980, 1999; Matlock et al. 2005). Previ-
ous research has shown that people represent the abstract concept of time by
constructing metaphoric mappings from the more concrete domain of space
(Barsalou and Weimer-Hastings 2005; Boroditsky 2000, 2001; Boroditsky and
Ramscar2002;Gentner2001).Previousstudieshaverevealedthatdifferentspa-
tial metaphorical mapping systems are employed when people think about
time (e.g., front/back, ego-moving/time-moving) (Gentner and Imai 1992; Gen-
tneretal.2002)andshownhowtheabstractconceptof timeisalsorepresented
bymeansof shapemetaphors(ChrysikouandRamey2006).Theallegeddepen-
dence of the temporal domain on the spatial one has led to the application of
the frame of reference theory, from the domain of space, to time (Bender et al.
2010, 2012; Tenbrink 2011; Zinken 2010).
It has also been claimed, on the other hand, that temporal perception relies
on independent, autonomous functions (Evans 2013; Kemmerer 2005) and that
in some cultures, the conceptual dependency of time on spatial representa-
tions seems weaker, as is the case among the Amazonian people of the Amon-
dawa (Sinha et al. 2011), among whom time seems to be marked by social
actions, such as a name change, rather than counted and represented in geo-
metrical structures. Among the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ as well, none of the elderly speakers
really knows her/his age and asking their year of birth makes no sense to them,
as there was no registry office then. Time is rather marked by physical matu-

rity, marriage, the birth of children, or important historical events. These facts
indeed constitute the framework of narrations and memories. Genealogies are
at the basis of the time count, just as they are in Biblical culture. Nonetheless,
in both language and cognition, events are sequenced in taa according to an
interesting variety of spatial parameters, some of which are the continuations
of very ancient practices.
2
Temporal Frames of Reference
Evans (2013) argues that there are elements of frames of reference in the
domain of time that are distinct and distinguishable from frames of reference
in the domain of space. According to Evans, this is a consequence of a differ-
ence in the underlying experience types that structure our conceptualizations
of time and space. The experience types that underlie, in part, temporal repre-
sentations are inherently temporal, rather than spatial, in nature. They consist
of a range of types, the hallmark of frames of reference in the domain of time
being transience (Galton 2011). Evans thus proposes a tripartite typology for
temporal frame of reference that includes a deictic, a sequential, and an extrin-
sic frame of reference. In this chapter, I focus only on the way in which aṣ-Ṣāniʿ
speakers sequence temporally related events, especially in cognition, having
extensively described the prepositional strategies used in linguistic represen-
tationsinchapter4.IntheexperimentsthatIshowhere,theevents’sequencing

or any other geometric arrangement whose structure may entail one or more
of the spatial referential types described so far (Levinson 2003; Bohnemeyer

and Chatterjee (2010) and largely applied by Moore (2000, 2006, 2011).

Historical and Cultural Background
As Wyatt notes (2001), ancient Middle Eastern societies anchored the concep-
tualization of time onto the east/west axis, based on the observation of the
daily course of the sun, with the exception of ancient Egyptians, whose default
facing direction was the south, toward the Nile’s sources. As I have described
in the case of the Bedouin cultures, in ancient Middle Eastern cultures the east
was associated with both the default facing direction and the past (chapter 4).
Macdonald summarizes the temporal implications of the basic east/west axis
as follows (2013: 86–87):

East: turning one’s face toward the rising sun (Latin: (sol) oriens); Hebrew
and Ugaritic qedem/qadm means ‘face, east, past’ (Qimron 1979); we face
the past, it is in front of us.
West: the opposite of East; Hebrew the root ʾ.ḫ.r means back, west,
future, and ‘other;’ the future lies behind us, unseen, unknown, and un-
knowable. Awareness of the future causes anxiety and fear, and perhaps
encourages the invention of means to predict and control it.
South: facing east, south is to one’s right; within the scheme of the
bilaterality of brain hemispheres’ activity, the right side is associated with
security, well-being, and morality;
North: facing east, north is to one’s left, so it represents sinister, danger-
ous things and functions, including where the gods dwell.
In Wyatt’s words: ‘I stand on a line going from east to west, from past to future.
I am moving along this line backwards. The past recedes and every moment
I experience is already a past experience’ (2001: 37). Wyatt notes that this line
can be straight, crooked, or cyclical. According to McGlone and Harding (1998),
the position of past and future is a question of different perspectives, or rather
of referential structures. Comparing different ancient cosmologies, Macdonald
(2013)concludesthat‘[…]characteristicof archaicmentalityassuchisthatone

from the age of gold to the age of silver, then bronze and now iron. Hesiod (and
others later) saw steady ‘regress’ from the most distant past to the present and

while humans are always represented laterally, gods can also stand frontally?
What does this say about the relationship of both groups to time and eternity?
(Frankfort 1978).
The etymological and semantic connection between right/ eft and east/west
noticed by Comrie (2003) has interesting implications in the ancient Egyptian

further meanings correlated to the southern (front) and the northern (back)
sides of the cosmos. Looking towards the south, the sun appears on the left. It
crosses one’s front while increasing in elevation toward the south, then sinks to
the right, to the west. Tracing an imaginary line tht passes through the sun and
bisects the entire dome of the sky, half the turning sky is ahead of the sun (on
the right) and half is behind the sun (on the left). Thus, at dawn, the right side
of the sky faces us,while at sunset, its left side faces us.This is why the sun is the
sky’s right eye and the moon is its left eye. Pyramid Texts 1132–1137 say that the
sun descends in order to rise again (Faulkner 1969: 185–186), suggesting the sun
isin somehigh placewhileitisoutof sight.TheCarlsbergpapyrusI.D.11.32says
the lands of the dwȝt, the point at which the sun rejuvenated itself at night, are
high.Oppositetothefamiliarterritoriesof theNilevalley,thenightrealmof the
dwȝt was different, unknown, and mysterious (Hornung 1968: 73), and there-
fore equated with foreign or unknown territories, which were associated with
mountain peaks (Plumley 1975: 20). Ancient Egyptians did use absolute direc-
tions, but as the sky was conceived as movable, their use of cardinal directions
was different from the modern use of them. In the ancient Egyptian model,
west and east were dependent on time. Rather than being perceived as regions
of the sky, directions were understood as times connected with certain regions
of the sky. The right/west side of the sky was the day, and the left/east side was
the night. This kind of conceptualization of cardinal directions, relative to the
observer, explains the etymological connection of ‘west’ and ‘east’ with ‘right’
and ‘left’ respectively.
Beside the semantic extension of cardinal directions into the domain of spa-
tial conceptualization, other non-cardinal prepositional strategies were also
employed in Ancient Egyptian to describe relations of anteriority and posteri-
ority,suchasḥȝ.t,usedforboththespatial‘infrontof’andthetemporal‘before,’
in combination with prepositional heads such as m, r, and ẖr (Di Biase-Dyson
2012).1
The coexistence of geocentric and non-geocentric representations attests to
a complex interplay of different spatiotemporal referential systems that prob-
ably interacted in early phases or followed each other over time, strikingly
similarly to what was found in taa and detailed here. The similarity between
Ancient Egyptian and Bedouin Arabic varieties may well not be casual, but
1 Di Biase-Dyson (2012) outlines the distribution of the simple preposition ḥȝ.t and its com-
pounds for different diachronic phases of Ancient Egyptian, proving them to be synonyms
but rather expressions of different aspects of spatiotemporal relations. The same situation
has been observed in the previous chapters on spatial aṣ-Ṣāniʿ data in the case of simple
prepositions, min compounds, and min chains.

perhaps was induced partly by common inheritance and partly by sustained
cultural and linguistic contact, proved by Borg to have existed already during
the Old Kingdom (2021).2
The impact of spatial orientation on our understanding of time has largely
been considered an obvious phenomenon, evident in grammars and lexica of
many of the world’s languages (Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976: 375; Lyons 1977:
718). Our personal mental representations of time also appear to be based on
space (Boroditsky 2000; Boroditsky and Ramscar 2002; Casasanto and Borodit-
sky 2008; Gevers et al. 2003; Núñez and Sweetser 2006; Santiago et al. 2007;
Torralbo et al. 2006). Lakoff (1993: 218) assumes that our metaphorical under-
standing of time in terms of space is biologically determined: ‘In our visual sys-
tems, we have detectors for motion and detectors for objects/locations. We do
not have detectors for time (…). Thus, it makes good biological sense that time
should be understood in terms of things and motion.’ A number of cognitive
and psycholinguistic experiments have supported the notion that to represent
time, people around the world rely on space (Boroditsky et al. 2010).
Cross-linguistic and cross-cultural enquiry largely support the ‘space-to-
time metaphor’ hypothesis, emphasizing that the way people spatialize time
differs across languages and cultures depending on available spatial represen-
tations,spatio-temporalmetaphors,andculturalartifacts,aswellasonindivid-
ual disposition, age, and experience (Casasanto and Boroditsky 2008; Fuhrman
and Boroditsky 2010). The tasks by means of which temporal dependency on
space has been tested have been based on standard tests of temporal reason-
ing used in iq tests (Wechsler 1981). Across these studies, people from different
cultures or groups have been shown to differ in whether they think of time as
stationary or moving, limited or open-ended, horizontal or vertical, oriented
from left to right, right to left, front to back, back to front, east to west, and so on
(e.g., Boroditsky 2000; Boroditsky and Ramscar 2002; Fuhrman and Boroditsky
2010; Núñez and Sweetser 2006; Santiago et al. 2007; Torralbo et al. 2006; Tver-
sky et al. 1991). Americans tested on tasks based on iq tests have been shown
to organize temporal sequencing from left to right (Fuhrman and Boroditsky
2010; Tversky et al. 1991). All of the patterns reported until 2004 laid out time in
body-relative space (e.g., left to right, front to back).
Then, a study conducted by Boroditsky and Gaby (2010) showed that Aus-
tralian languages in which cardinal directions are used to represent cognitive
and linguistic spatial relations between objects also used cardinal directions

South American languages.

(the east/west axis) in temporal representations, i.e., to express anteriority and
posteriority (before/after) between events. This finding was surprising, as all
previous studies in other cultures had found temporal representations derived
from spatial representations to be relative to the self of the observer/speaker.
Nevertheless,the‘space-to-time,’or‘spacefirst’hypothesishasrecentlybeen
challenged by empirical evidence that humans directly perceive and feel the
passage of time (Evans 2004). A sizable body of cross-linguistic research on
the grammatical marking of time on verbs, i.e., the domain of tense and aspect,
shows that the use of spatial periphrastic expressions is by no means geograph-
ically, genetically, or typologically limited (Anderson 1973; Traugott 1978). This
new perspective evokes the insight of B.L. Whorf, who claimed that the space-
to-time metaphor was not present in Hopi (an Uto-Aztecan language of Ari-
zona and New Mexico) (Whorf 1956: 146).
The dependence/independence of linguistic representations of anterior-
ity/posteriority from spatial ones in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ Arabic across the three genera-
tions analyzed here was addressed in the chapter 4 of this book. The situation
of the linguistic dependence of the domain of space on that of time was not
found to be univocal. The temporal relationships of anteriority/posteriority in
aṣ-Ṣāniʿ are represented along the front/back axis. In taa informants and some
maa informants, some prepositions and adverbs are used in both domains,
while others are time-specific. Absolute representations of temporal relations
are not found. In yaa, the distinction between anteriority and posteriority in
spaceandtimebecomesclearersinceitisexpressedbydifferentpairsof prepo-
sitions. It is also difficult to understand how the front/back axis is associated
with anteriority/ posteriority.The use of prepositions is often paradoxical, with
lexemes derived from g.d.m., which can simultaneously indicate anteriority in
the past, the distant past, and a future event.
In general, the expressions that indicate anteriority and posteriority of
events express the classic metaphorical representations of the space-moving
type (Gentner et al. 2002), for example:
as-sinih illī fātat, (lit. ‘the year who has entered’), e.g., ‘the past year’ or
as-sinih illī ğāyih, (lit. ‘the year who comes (toward the speaker)’), e.g.,
‘next year.’
In gestures, all aṣ-Ṣāniʿ generations indicate the past by pointing behind their
backs and to the future by pointing forward.
This chapter tackles the question of how and how strictly spatial and tem-
poral structures correlate in cognition by examining the applications of spa-
tial referential strategies to sequenced temporal events in taa, maa, and yaa,

according to the experiments on temporal sequencing in Boroditsky and Gaby
(2010) and Fuhrman and Boroditsky (2010). I propose that the attitude toward
metaphorical processing—including the space-to-time transfer—may differ
widely across languages and cultures.

Methodology
In order to test cognitive temporal sequencing and the location of anterior-
ity and posteriority, two types of tasks were used: card arrangement and dot
drawing. Since a pilot survey showed no particular qualitative or quantitative
difference in the results due to different locations of the experimental setting,
the testing was carried out only in Ligīyih. The same sixty informants tested
for the domain of space were also tested in the domain of temporal represen-
tations, divided by age into three groups of twenty informants each (ten men
and ten women).
4.1
Card-Arrangement Task
In the card-arrangement task, participants were tested on three sets of four
cards each. Each set of cards depicted a temporal progression (e.g., a man at
different ages). In each trial, participants were handed a shuffled set of cards
and asked to lay them out on the ground in the correct order. Each partici-
pant arranged a given set only once. According to the procedural suggestion in
Boroditsky and Gaby (2010), each participant was tested in two sittings, each
of which included half of the card sets. The two sittings took place with the
participant facing in different cardinal directions, generally 180° or 90° apart.
After the participant arranged half of the card sets, I explained that it was nec-
essary to get a different angle for the camera and asked the participant to sit in
a different place before continuing with the task. This explanation allowed the
experimenter to turn the participant halfway through the task in a way that
minimized social awkwardness. Participants interpreted the task as a test of
their temporal reasoning and were unaware that the particular spatial orienta-
tions they were producing were the measure of interest.
Pilot surveys on taa prompted me to modify the standard time-testing
methodology by including in each individual experimental session at least the
following: a series of individual pictures of the informant at different ages; pic-
tures of a different, unknown person (a relative of mine) at different ages; and
pictures of an inanimate object (e.g., a pizza being eaten; a piece of fruit rot-
ting progressively). Preliminary observations revealed that the first two indeed
produced different types of responses among taa informants.

4.2
Dot-Placing Task
As explained in Boroditsky and Gaby (2010), the dot-drawing task followed the
same design, but instead of arranging picture cards, participants placed dots
corresponding to temporal periods on the ground. For example, the exper-
imenter placed a dot in front of the participants and said, ‘If this is today,
where would you put yesterday? And where would you put tomorrow?’ Partic-
ipants indicated their answer by drawing dots in the sand or placing stones or
round plastic chips on the ground. The temporal periods tested included days
of the week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday) and times of the day (morning,
noon, evening), as well as deictic one-day intervals (yesterday, today, tomor-
row), weeks (last week, this week, next week), and long periods (olden days,
nowadays, far in the future).
In this case, the original procedure of the experiment was called ‘dot draw-
ing’ in Boroditsky and Gaby (2010), but as taa informants are not familiar with
writing practices and some of the maa informants and yaa informants could
have been influenced by writing practices they acquired in formal education, I
preferred to avoid drawing and thus adopted the dot-placing (in the form of a
coloredplasticdiskorastone)acrossallgenerationsforthesakeof consistency.

Results
The results of the two experiments described are reported one after the other,
in decreasing order of age through the three generations examined, first taa,
then maa, and finally yaa. In the temporal domain as well, the taa group of
informants proved to be much more homogeneous in its responses than the
group of maa speakers. Thus, the responses of the taa and yaa informants
were similarly consistent, while the maa group is more internally heteroge-
neous, demonstrating the characteristics of a transitional system.
5.1
Card-Arrangement Task
The sequencing system in use in the taa group was found to be very complex,
withdifferentaxes,absoluteandrelative,involvedintherepresentationsof dif-
ferent types of objects in the sequences.
Ingeneral,whenfacedwiththecardsthatrepresentedtheagingsequenceof
my relative and the inanimate object, taa informants looked toward the north,
faced north, and started placing the first card, continuing the sequence until
they reached the more advanced stages, toward the south. The order was from
north (anteriority) to south (posteriority) of the visual fields of the informants,
as reported in Figure 149:

taa Card Arrangement Task/Dominant Strategy/Entity ≠Self
The past, therefore, is located towards the north and as the sequence arrives
at its end, it approaches the here and now of the Observer/informant. The sys-
tem has a stringent logic. But the north/south orientation seemed odd. I had
expected to see an east/west orientation.
Figure 150 shows the results of the test performed with four photographs of
the informant at different ages. Photographs from their childhoods or teenage
years are not abundant among older taa speakers, so the images were taken
from their children’s weddings or events that had taken place at different
moments in the Observer/informants’ lives. In this case, the entity represented
in the cards coincides with the informant’s self.
In this case, with entity = self, the taa informants aligned the images from
oldest to most recent in front of them, from far to near, aligned with their
front/back axis, regardless of the cardinal direction. It can therefore be con-
cluded that when the entity represented in the cards is different from the
self of the informant, the absolute north/south axis is used, while when the
informant is the subject of the cards, it is not suitable. Why the north/south
cardinal axis is used is not clear. One of the possible explanations is that the
hydrographic system of the region, with its dominant artery in the Jordan Val-
ley, runs from north to south. The line of anteriority/ posteriority according
to which the informants ordered both their own and someone else’s pictures
coincides with their own front/back axis. In both cases the front/back axis
of the informants is used, as if time also included them and what happened
before, even to a different entity, was farther away, while what happened later

is deictically closer to the informants’ here and now. Nonetheless, the ques-
tion of why the north/south orientation was used when the entities repre-
sented in the cards were someone other than the informants needed to be
answered.
In this case, the answer came from a consultation with the elderly infor-
mants, who are considered more experienced in the language and traditional
customs. They explained to me that water flows from north to south. This local
reference to the water flow of the southeastern catchment basin, based in the
Jordan Valley, represents a temporal frame of reference with a geomorphic
anchoring. In fact, water is the only moving element with constant and rec-
tilinear movement, like that of time, in the natural surroundings, and it flows
into the sea, symbolically the end of life, i.e., death, the disintegration of all
life forms in Bedouin culture. The hypothesis of the connection with the water
stream remains to be tested experimentally.
As the image shows, there are no oppositions of any kind and the right/left
axis (from right to left) is developing. This is the only axis used by the yaa gen-
eration, regardless of the type of entity represented on the cards, as shown in
Figure 152.
Regarding the maa generation, several strategies were produced. They are
all reported in Figure 151.

which is the direction followed by Arabic and Hebrew, languages in which yaa
speakers are formally educated. Regarding the influence of the writing prac-
ticesontemporalsequencing,seeSantiagoetal.(2007)andTverskyetal.(1991).
Since not all maa and yaa respondents drive cars, perhaps the practice of
driving has less effect than that of writing. Driving cars requires specific train-
ing in distinguishing right from left and primes the acquisition of this distinc-
tion at deep cognitive levels, as the right/left distinction must be automatically
applied in a series of complex, combined actions during driving.
5.2
Dot-Placing Task
As suggested in the original methodology in Boroditsky and Gaby (2010) and
reported in the methodological section above, this task was divided into five
sub-tasks:
1.
days of the week (Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday),
2.
times of the day (morning, noon, evening),
3.
deictic one-day intervals (yesterday, today, tomorrow),
4.
weeks (last week, this week, next week), and
5.
long durations (olden days, nowadays, far in the future).
Figure 153 reports some representative results for all the sub-experiments,
divided by age groups, in a synoptic schema. Many other moments and periods
of time were tested, and are being processed, yet the results reported here are
representative of the main strategies used by the different aṣ-Ṣāniʿ generations
observed.
The black dot is the Ground I placed in front of the informant.The white one
is the response.The semicircle indicates the intermediate positions counted by
the informant, traces of which s/he left on the ground. Cardinal directions are
indicated only in those types of responses where they were involved.
In all cases, the informants were sensitive to the temporal distance of the
requested moment from their present moment. In fact, in addition to estab-
lishing the direction in which to place the dot, everyone was careful to place
the most distant moments in time even more distantly from themselves in the
space along the axis and in the chosen direction. When I specified in the ques-
tion the number of units by which the requested moment was separated from
the present one, all informants counted by marking that number of spaces in
the sand; e.g., if I requested ‘two days ago,’ the informants counted two imagi-
nary positions.
The days of the week are known to all generations, being a form of calcula-
tion included in religious practices. Friday, for example, is the day of prayer in
the mosque. taa informants insisted on putting the dot behind their backs and
then stated that they could not put it in front of them because it would conflict

3 I asked for the position of the day that was two days before the test, mentioning the Arabic
name of the day of the week requested, in order to avoid the elicitation of different deictic
values across trials, since the deictic component should be neutral in this type of task. Yet,
when some informants asked: ‘Which Friday, the past or the next one?’ I had to specify that I
was looking for the past one. In the end, this type of task implies deictic information.

of the day.

with their position, as the requested day (by name) fell two days before the
meeting with me. The older maa informants followed this taa pattern (A.),
while others placed the dot in front of them, but closer than the Ground I
had placed before in front of them (B.) Still others placed it to the right of the
Ground (C.), as happens in yaa. This last strategy is due to the conception of
anteriority to the right of posteriority along the right/left axis.
Interestingly, for the taa and maa informants, morning is to the east, while
for the yaa informants it is to the right, because it is before the time of day
(evening) when the tests were performed. Indeed, in this case too, as for the
days of the week, the ‘morning’ can be today’s morning (before ‘this evening’)

or tomorrow’s morning (after ‘this evening’). The choice of the east seemed
to me very logically elegant, while the yaa choice of anteriority (right side of
the Ground) tells us much about the modern conception of the day as a unit
that goes from the morning to the evening (unknown to ancient cultures, in
which the day starts after sunset). Past, present, and future are treated differ-
ently among informants from the different groups.
‘Tomorrow’ is also east for taa and older maa informants, while other maa
informants place it aligned with the Ground and ahead of it. yaa informants,
consistently with the conception of posteriority deictically left of the Ground,
placed it accordingly. It is interesting to note that with regard to deictic expres-
sions such as ‘yesterday’ and ‘tomorrow,’ maa uses only the front/back axis,
while for more specific, less salient, moments such as ‘two days ago,’ ‘in three
days,’ the more modern lateral axis is also used. Probably the use of numbers,
specificquantifiers,attractsthisformallyacquiredstrategy.‘Nextweek’isahead
for both taa and maa, while it is left for yaa speakers. In contrast, the distant
future is placed far ahead in all generations, revealing the great influence of
temporal distance on the stable axis along which the moment is positioned.
This operation is strongly influenced by cultural factors. The future is also des-
tiny, with superstitious and apotropaic connotations, towards which human
beings move forward from the present.

Discussion of the Temporal Data
Even in the case of time, I believe that composing a unitary and simplified pro-
file is not an easy task. For the yaa generation, it is relatively simple. For the
maa generation, as I have mentioned several times in this book, more detailed
data and larger numbers of informants are needed. For the taa generation,
the complexity seen in the domain of space is also reflected in the domain
of time. In particular, I would have expected a greater similarity of the spa-
tial and temporal cognitive structures, with a strong presence of the cardinal
directions in the sequencing and also in the positioning of moments of time,
i.e., in both experiments. Instead, I noticed that some aspects have emerged
in the taa selection of the time axes that characterize the selection of frames
of reference in the spatial language, such as resorting to absolute strategies
when the ground is unknown or using a mixture of absolute and relative strate-
gies, as seen in language with absolute min chains when an observer is aligning
a series of cards with an entity other than the observer with her/himself, as
everythingthatexists,knownorunknown,seemstobeincludedalongthetime

This chapter concludes this book, and also marks the end of a ten-year jour-
ney through the space and time of the Bedouin of the Negev. The impression I
have, both from the mismatch between language and cognition in space, and
from the difficult superimposition of spatial and temporal categories in the dif-
ferentgenerations,isthatratherthansearchingfortheequivalenceof framesof
reference or axes in space and time and in language and cognition, one must
instead pay attention to the semantic elements that each culture selects that
seem to influence all the representations in the different domains at different
levels.

Conclusions: Language, Thought, Culture, and
Reality
At the end of this work, I am more convinced than ever that ‘culture,’ the com-
plex of manifestations of the material, social, and spiritual life of a human
group in relation to the various phases of an evolutionary process, different
historical periods, or environmental conditions, is central to the definition of
referential styles. I also believe that, as P. Brown (2002) argues, it has a com-
pletely different role and character and is not to be confused with what we
currentlycall‘cognition,’‘non-linguisticthought,’andeven‘mind.’Inparticular,
material culture, the natural environment, and the relationship with it shape
the knowledge and language of space and the relationship between their struc-
tures. If culture is a difficult concept to define, reality is immensely more so. At
the end of this short essay, and after some ten years with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, I believe
that ‘culture’ is a set of meanings that collectively make sense of experience. In
traditional societies, a large part of the meaning that language communicates
lies in culture.
The dramatic linguistic changes between the taa generation and the yaa
generation, shown in detail in this book for the domains of space and time,
reflect changes in the organization of material life, the shape and location of
homes, the construction of roads, contact with other cultures and their organi-
zation of space, the practice of writing, and technologies with which humans
interact. In the mid-twentieth century, all these changes took traditional Negev
Bedouin culture by surprise, causing the immediate decay of the meanings of
taa prepositional strategies.
This sudden and unexpected transformation had immediate impact on maa
linguisticdescriptionsof spatialandtemporalrelations,inwhichalltaaprepo-
sitional strategies are formally still in use, but the old distributive parameters
according to which taa applied them are no longer understood. Therefore, the
same prepositional strategies, such as simplex prepositions, min compounds,
and min chains, for example, are used according to new parameters. Differ-
ent taa strategies become synonymous in maa, having lost their old semantic
oppositions, which were ultimately supported by the scenes, activities, and
rhythms of traditional life. When different linguistic exponents become syn-
onymous, some disappear, as seen in yaa, where the strategies employed and
their grammatical representations contain a much smaller number of ele-
ments.

The maa generation has undergone cultural and linguistic transitions from
its older to its younger elements. This process has resulted in the application
of linguistic representations of taa among its older members, or of yaa among
its younger members, and of numerous other strategies (even the use of tem-
poral prepositions for spatial representations) that compensate for the loss of
the old semantic oppositions.
The transitional maa generation has also faced the fragmentation of land
and society, the transition from an egalitarian society to one in which there
are significant differences between men and women, rich and poor, insiders
and outsiders. These changes took place due to the loss of lands and flocks, the
reorganization of family units, new job opportunities, and a dialogue, often dif-
ficult, with Western models, between integration and reaction.
Languagehaschangedalongwithmaterialculture.Iwouldsaythatlanguage
has changed as a result of changes in material culture, social organization,
and relationships with space. Temporal cognition has also changed quickly.
Yet, surprisingly, spatial cognition has remained tenaciously the same through
the generations, since for the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, the link with the tribal territory has not
been interrupted. Cultural changes, therefore, modify the language of space,
the language of time, and the cognition of time, while the relationship with
the territory is directly connected with the cognitive bedrock.
Surprisingly, in fact, within the boundaries of the tribal territories, absolute
spatial orientation is still vividly practiced, even by the very young. In 2015,
a twelve-year-old girl, called Rīm drew, at my request, a map of Israel on the
board, as shown in Figure 154.
She explained to me that the sea is ‘on these sides’ (where she traced the
waves, in correspondence of the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea) and that
‘we are here’ (where the black dot is sketched, in correspondence with the loca-
tion of Ligīyih).The wall on which the blackboard was hung was oriented along

the north/south axis, and the map, with the Mediterranean Sea at the top and
the Red Sea to the left, reflects the absolute orientation of the support, just
as it did for the elderly, when they described scenes shown on the computer
screen. Many young friends, in their twenties, drawing a Bedouin tent, oriented
its entrance to the east automatically. A feeling of space that provides a sense
of understanding the world and large spaces does not easily disappear.
But far from home, for example in Rome, where one goes to study medicine,
it is difficult to find the direction of Mecca and attempting to have your father
explain it on the phone is much more difficult than having him come to Rome
to explain how to find directions at any time, with no compass and no mosque
in sight. This experience was related to me by Ḥusayn, one of the sons of
ʿAbdelkarīm.
At the end of this project, I can say that the topics covered and perhaps the
goals achieved are many and varied. I therefore briefly summarize them here.
First, from a methodological point of view, this work offers ideas for modifica-
tionsof traditionalmethodologiesthatcanhelpotherscholarstofindtheirway
in space and time and reveal elements of ‘culture’ typical of the various tradi-
tional societies that we still have the possibility of knowing. In fact, in both
spatial and temporal cognition, the same cultural elements that govern the
selection of linguistic strategies, such as the distinction between known and
unknown entities, both in space and in spatial sequencing, alignment with the
observer, and ontological type (symmetrical vs. asymmetrical) can be found.
In fact, geometrical and ‘logical’ rules still represent the methodological
foundation of many theories of space categorization, in particular in the do-
main of spatial prepositions, including those of Cooper (1968), Leech (1969),
Bennett (1975), and Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976), summarized by Hersko-
witz in the ‘simple-relations model’ (1986). The most evident limitation of this
model is the fact that, actually, Ground-objects can be differently conceptual-
ized within the same language and from a cross-linguistic perspective. During
the 1980s, some semantic theories recognized this fact. This recognition repre-
sented a turning point in the development of the neo-relativistic perspective,
for example in Jackendoff’s Semantics and Cognition (1983), which is based on
the premise that our vision of the world is largely determined by the concepts
or mental representations according to which we organize external percep-
tions, or as in Vandeloise’s L’espace en français, where the author affirms: ‘C’est
donc vers la connaissance du monde qui nous entoure et la manière dont nous
le percevons et concevons que je me suis tourné pour donner à ces mots une
explication au tant complète que possible’ (Vandeloise [(1986)1991: 239]).
The diverse combinations of frames of reference required by the taa system
to describe the space around objects demonstrate that the value of the frames

of reference as universal semantic categories can be easily overshadowed by
the particular cultural visions of reality. Such cultural factors are bound to
the classification of the objects that exist in the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ world, a classifica-
tion that entails their specific and usual shapes, functions, values, and routine
positions alongside other culture-specific features. Thus, beyond the widely
recognized set of geometric and functional patterns presumably detectable in
all languages, I claim that a strongly structured cultural ontology of realia exists
at the foundation of the semantics of space.
In the cultural ontology of spatial entities, used to classify objects in the
real world, understand their status, and speak authentically about them, every
culturedetermineswhetheragivenobjectdoesordoesnothaveacertainprop-
erty, and in what proportion it has that property compared with other objects.
In my opinion, the essence of the semantics of space is based on the way in
which we classify the objects and bodies around us, and, consequently, their
parts, which often become grammaticalized as spatial connectors (adverbs
and/or prepositions), and the ways in which we expect these objects to interact
with each other. As Blau noted with respect to medieval Judeo-Arabic, it is not
easy in general to determine the borderline between the continuing adverbial
usage of a noun and its passage to prepositional usage (Blau 2010: 202). The
same hybrid status is found in the language of the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, as an effect of the
observance of the properties of real objects and object parts, which retards the
development of autonomous grammatical uses (with respect to the dialects of
the fallāḥīn, which normally use ğanb ‘side’ without any other simple preposi-
tion such as fi ‘in’ or ʿala ‘on’).
The culture-dependent and language-specific elements found in taa lan-
guage and cognition, space, and time, are actually culture-specific. Familiarity
and cultural salience of objects and interactions and prototypical alignments
between objects are elements that emerge in linguistic spatial descriptions and
determine the selection of referential and grammatical strategies that express
them linguistically. These sememes, minimal semantic features, are cultural in
nature. The same sememes seem to both permeate the language and modify
the cognitive bedrock. In fact, comparing space to time and language to cogni-
tion, taa sememes are the common elements, not the referential strategies or
the meaning of the lexical exponents tout court.
Culture includes genetics and, most of all, history. Hybrid referential forms
between the absolute and the deictic, present in aṣ-Ṣāniʿ, are also widespread
in the Cushitic languages, while the aligned field, the only strategy with which
the relative frame is applied in taa, is dominant in Hausa, where it was first
described. Attention to the alignment between scene and Observer position
are evident in these Afroasiatic languages. Nevertheless, attention to axial con-

chapter 10
straintsseemstobeafeaturethatunitesmanygeocentricsystems,evenoutside
the Afroasiatic family (chapter 2). The linguistic genetic tendencies of lan-
guages are also, or probably, from the perspective of the linkage theory (Ross
1988), above all, historical and sociological questions.
With regard to the historical perspective, I showed in chapter 4 how the
pastoralism of the ancient Near East speaks the language of the cardinal direc-
tions, viewing the world as an unopened curtain and the east as the place of
sunrise, associated with the advent of divinity. The biblical text and the nar-
rative of the Gospels are full of such references (chapter 4). Right and left
have evident moral implications in blessings, oath taking, and as symbols of
social and spiritual hierarchies (‘This is the firstborn, put your right hand on
his head!’ Gen. 48: 18; ‘The Lord Jesus, after speaking with them, was lifted up
into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God,’ Mark 16: 19). All Bedouin
cultures, from Arabia to Africa and Central Asia, show signs of a geocentric
conception of space whose source seems to be multiple across the majority
of them: winds, natural landmarks, wadi streams and slopes and clines of alti-
tude, cardinal directions, celestial bodies, and artificial human landmarks. The
anchoring strategies are also multiple; geocentric polyframing indeed seems
to be a tendency of all geocentric coding languages, i.e., their speakers seem
to be able to shift between different geocentric substrategies quite naturally,
as Ozanne-Rivièrre noted in her studies on Oceanic languages, where names
of cardinal directions are usually generalized from landmarks (1987). This is
also the way in which absolute directions are lexicalized and their meanings
extended (Cerqueglini and Henkin 2016; chapter 4). Still today, even among
sedentary Arabic young people, it is not uncommon to find expressions such as
‘toward the classroom window,’ or ‘toward the door,’ which are local landmark-
based strategies of a novel sort. And, of course, geocentric cognition is also not
uncommon, as I found during classes.
Unfortunately, despite the abundance of written sources, across the entire
linguistic horizon, not only Semitic, but Afroasiatic, there have been very few
investigationstodateonthelinguisticandcognitivestrategiesthatregulatethe
use of spatial frames of reference, temporal cognition, and the distribution of
prepositions in both spatial and temporal domains, as Tosco notes (2009). One
welcome, recent exception is by al-Shehri on Peninsular Urban Hiğāzi (Bohne-
meyer et al. 2022).
The major merits of this study, in my opinion, are its novel method (the tick
test) for testing the disambiguation of the meanings of prepositional strategies
(simplex preposition, min compound, and min chain) in the three main frames
of reference, both in static and dynamic scenes. Another important contribu-
tion to the general theory of frames of reference in language is the identifica-

tion of cultural criteria (ontological, functional, and axial) in the selection of
taa referential strategies in language. An important difference between this
study and previous ones on Negev Arabic spatial language lies in its identifica-
tionof thesalienceof theaffordancerelationship(Gibson1979)betweenFigure
and Ground as a semantic discriminant; even a Ground that attracts the intrin-
sic frame of reference, if placed with a figure with which it cannot interact in a
culturally salient way, is processed in geocentric terms.
Finally, the geometric (distance) and axial (alignment, functional recipro-
cal orientation) relationships between Figure and Ground and between Fig-
ure, Ground, and Observer have strong implications of a cultural nature, since
salient scenes in the Bedouin natural and social realm are considered the
default, while those that deviate from the codified and indexicalized set of
functional scene models are grammatically marked (generally by min com-
pounds) (chapters 5, 6, 7).
Anadditionalcontributionof thisworkistheidentificationof hybridframes
of reference in taa. Indeed, the use of min chains marks the fact that the posi-
tion of the Observer in relation to the scene is entailed in the description. This
is also valid in geocentric and intrinsic representations, which also provide
deictic information. The discovery of hybrid frames sheds light on the contigu-
ity and structural continuity between the different frames of reference, which
must be sought precisely in the sememes, their smallest constituent elements:
thetypesof objectsandtheirfixedorientation(suchastheBedouintent,whose
front is also the east; Cerqueglini and Henkin 2018), and functional axial dis-
tinctions. All these elements (sememes) have been shown to entail undeniable
culture-dependent content, at least in the traditional aṣ-Ṣāniʿ variety.
The fourth chapter also contains interesting comparisons between the geo-
centric treatment of the wadi in Sinaitic Jbāli, according to what emerges from
the observations of Nishio (1992, 1996) and the geomorphic treatment of the
wadi in taa. Furthermore, the partitioning of the landmarks into inherent
facets that originate in human or animal body parts (Alʿatāmīn 2011) has been
experimentally tested over the three generations under examination to shed
light on their actual meanings and extensions. The use of human and animal
intrinsic armatures and their progressive decay in maa and yaa have been
described in depth.
taa also shows that the application of different substrategies of the geocen-
tric frame are task-specific. Faced with pictures of actual, known landmarks,
taa informantsrespondinabsoluteterms,accordingtotheactualabsoluteori-
entation of the mountain or wadi, while when faced with abstract representa-
tionsof amountainorawadi(inaschematic,essentialdrawing),theyapplythe

ern direction and the wadi geomorphically, associating it with a north/south
course, based on their experience of the local landscape. Similarly, Bohne-
meyer (2011) reported that Yucatec Mayan speakers used different framing
strategies based on what he called ‘task specificity.’ With respect to the dis-
tribution of frames of reference within a language, Tversky (1996), operating
in the framework of cognitive studies, observed that the selection of frames
of references depends on properties of the task, e.g., the scale of the things to
be described, how the information is to be used, and so on. Levinson (2003),
attempting to delve into the typological classification of languages and test the
‘language-to-cognition correlation,’ states the following:
[…] we need to distinguish between (a) a cross-situation typing, […]
[based on] a general preference for one frame of reference over another
across situations, and (b) a typing that is keyed to a specific kind of spa-
tial array or situation […] most languages provide special expressions for
morethanoneframeof reference,andthereareconventionsforthekinds
of circumstances each frame of reference is used in. So we need to rela-
tivizethestatementtosituationsof use.[…]Theideabehindthehypothe-
sisisthatcommunity-wideconventionsaboutwhatlinguisticexpressions
mean and how they are to be used will tend to induce a way of thinking
in which the immediate, unreflective memory coding matches the kind
of coding required to describe an arbitrary spatial array.
The effects of the presence of a mountain-like landmark, devised intention-
ally and inspired by Li and Gleitman’s intrinsic primer (2002), and a schematic
wadi, in the experimental setting of the cognitive tests, revealed the same
task specificity in taa geocentric responses. Similarly, the alignment with the
Observerandtheontologicalpropertiesof theobjectsselectedforthecognitive
tests, revealed that, albeit within absolute responses, elements of attention to
the asymmetry or alignment of the toys were observable, once again attesting
to the impact of sememes in cognition and an embryonic potential for cog-
nitive hybrid strategies. Nonetheless, taa cognition remains tenaciously abso-
lute, regardless of the changing contextual elements in the methodology of the
experiments.
One of the most interesting modifications of the traditional cognitive
methodology was the movement of the informants through different locations
fortherealizationof theexperiments(Cerqueglini2022),inparticular,notonly
in Ligīyih, but also in Kerak, where the eastern mountains are paradoxically to

taa speakers’ knowledge remains stably absolute, with no differences between

men and women, the knowledge of maa and yaa speakers strongly depends
on location. Within the Negev, cognition appears absolute across all genera-
tions,whileoutsidetheNegev,itprogressivelyevolvestowardslandmark-based
and relative strategies, with a particular bias towards the intrinsic elements of
the scenes among the yaa speakers, supporting the thesis of Bohnemeyer et al.
(2022). Referential practices seem to change over time, especially in language
(Dunn et al. 2021).
The domain of time, with its implications of dependence on space and inde-
pendence from it in language and cognition, was also investigated here across
the three generations. It is clear that temporal cognition seems highly influ-
enced among the yaa speakers by the practice of writing, while in taa there
are still some traces of a system based on the sun and its positions, i.e., the
temporal sequencing on the east/west axis (Boroditsky and Gaby 2010). Again,
incognitivetemporalrepresentationsaswell,sequencingscenesforunfamiliar
entities (in this case, the entity is different from the informant) attracts abso-
lute axial solutions, while when the sequencing is carried out with cards that
represent the informant her/himself, it is done deictically. Interestingly, time
is also conceived in taa cognition as a part of nature, anchored on the water
stream, whose main direction is the north/south axis, as seen from the south-
ern Levant in relation to the hydrographic basin of the Jordan Valley, which is
dominant and perennial one (unlike seasonal wadis that disappear as the rains
cease).
This book talks about space and time through the voices of informants. The
time is represented by the events surrounding the birth of the State of Israel
and the space is a disputed land. The stories are those of the elderly, the facts,
the places, the times of the great history and the descriptions of the domes-
tic spaces, the known horizons, the times of traditional activities in the idyllic
period that was ended by the conflict. Their stories and their explanations,
in the original language, recorded, transcribed, and translated by me, are the
most interesting part of the work, in which the changes of a traditional cul-
ture and society are narrated in first person by the stories’ protagonists. These
changes have resulted in the linguistic and cognitive shifts through the gener-
ations described in this work.
I bring the writing of this work to an end with the awareness that I still must
put down in writing much more of what I have observed in these ten years
with the aṣ-Ṣāniʿ and much remains to be done. An important part of the work
that remains is the comparison of aṣ-Ṣāniʿ data with the spatial and temporal,
linguistic and cognitive referential practices of other languages from both syn-
chronicanddiachronicperspectives.Thisenterprisebeganinameta-studycar-

of geocentric frame of reference to persist in cognition even for generations
that no longer use it in linguistic representations. Furthermore, the interesting
coexistof arichsetof referentialstrategiesamongtheeldersanditsprogressive
loss and reduction among the younger generations could be investigated from
the point of view of changes in pragmatical implications and social practices,
as proposed by Sidnell and Enfield (2012). Moreover, tendencies, limits, and
typological implicatures involved in the relation between spatial and temporal
representations in language and cognition should also be taken into consid-
eration. Indeed, as Aikhenvald and Dixon (2017) remind us, a choice made in
one part of a linguistic system may limit a set of options in some other area.
This choice may indicate a universal tendency and also be reflected in cogni-
tive practices. In the midst of a menacing and tenacious pandemic that rages
among the elderly of traditional societies, even in the Negev, sweeping away
their languages and their worlds even more rapidly, I offer this work to the next
generations with trust and hope as a celebration of the diversity, unpredictabil-
ity, and beauty of human cultures that we must never forget.
