Chapter 3 
The behavior of solutions of 
one-dimensional nonlinear 
problems over extended time. 
In this chapter we shall investigate the asymptotic behavior of solutions 
of quasilinear parabolic equations with one spatial variable. Now, there 
are many works where the qualitative properties of quasilinear parabolic 
equations with one spatial variable have been investigated. Here we 
mainly give the results of the authors of this book. The bibliography 
lists other publications that are closest to our research. 
Note, also, that a great many of the techniques of this chapter fail 
for quasilinear parabolic equations with many spatial variables. There 
are other results that hold even for parabolic equations with many 
spatial variables and these will be considered further. The methods 
for solving these statements for quasilinear parabolic equations with 
one spatial variable and for quasilinear parabolic equations with many 
spatial variables differ essentially from each other. Therefore, we shall 
give both of the methods, the more so, as for the parabolic equation 
with one spatial variable we have evolved a refined method demanding 
fewer assumptions about the problem. 
The examples in this chapter are of great importance, since they 
allow us to clarify the results and to understand which restrictions are 
essential.

§3.1 
Liapunov's functionals and asympto-
tic behavior of solutions for extended 
time. 
We shall consider the quasilinear problem 
ut = a(x,u,ux)uxx 
+ b(x,u,ux), 
(1.1) 
aiUx(i,O + Vi(u(U)) = 0> 
» = 0,1, 
ί >0, 
(1.2) 
ii(x,0) = u0(x), 
(1.3) 
in the semi-strip (x, t) 6 Q = [0,1] x [0, +oo), or in the rectangle (x, t) Ε 
QT — [0,1] χ [0,T]. Further, we shall assume that functions a,b,<fi are 
from C 3 by their arguments. This assumption may be weakened, but it 
is not of paramount importance when considering these questions. We 
shall assume that 
a(x, ξ, η)>α0> 
0, 
(χ, ξ, η) € [0,1] Χ R2 
(1.4) 
α1 + Ψ?{ί) > αι > 
ί G R, 
αι = const 
u0(x) e Ε = {uo(x) G Cx[0,1], atu'0{i) + ^(u 0(i)) = 0, i = 0,l}. 
In the first chapter we have established the existence theorem locally 
for t and the uniqueness theorem for problem (1.1)-(1.3) with initial 
data from E. We shall denote this solution by u(x,t·, UQ). It was shown 
in chapter 1 that the height Τ of QT, where the solution u(x,t;uo) 
is 
determined, depends only on || u0 ||i. This allows us to establish the 
following statements (see lemma 5.3, chapter 1).

For the above assumptions, for each R > 0 there 
exists such T ( R ) > 0 that if || i/o ||ι< β, then the solution of (1.1)-
(1.3) exists in the interval t € (0,T(R)). Moreover, for each ε there 
exists such C(e) that 
II «(®,ί;ιχο) ||3ie< C(e) II tio IIP·11, 
(1.5) 
where Qs = [0,1] χ [ε,Τ), 
α > 0; the constant C(e) depends on the 
nonlinearities and grows for ε —• 0. 
L e m m a 1.2. 
Under the lemma 1.1 assumptions, if

||i°'^< oo;

then there exists a bounded sequence u(x,t\uo) 
for i,· —> +oo. 
By 
lemma 1.1, there exists such Τ > 0 that

therefore, if 0 < ε < Τ, then

This means that, in particular,

This proves the lemma.

M.P.Vishnevskii 
Here we shall consider such initial data uo, that the solution 
ii{x,t]UQ) may be extended for all t € (Ο,+οο). In this case two situa-
tions are possible. 
1) The value || u(x,t;u0) 
||i is uniformly bounded for t > 0. 
2) The value || u(x,t;uo) 
||i is not bounded for t > 0. 
In this paragraph we shall consider the first situation leaving the 
second for the next paragraphs. 
By analogy with the theory of ordinary differential equations, con-
sider the following notions. 
Definition 1.1. 
The set of partial limits for t 
oo in the norm 
C1[0,1] of the solution u(x, t\ u0) we shall call the co-limit set and denote 
it by u>(u0). 
Note that 
1) by lemma 1.2, if the lower limit of the solution norm in C1 for 
t —» oo is bounded, then ω(ΐ/0) is not empty and contains the smooth 
(from the space C2+Cl) elements. 
2) By lemma 1.1, if the solution u(x,t;uo) 
is uniformly by t > 0 
bounded in the norm of C1[0,1], then for t > t0 > 0, this solution is 
bounded in the norm of C3+a[0,1] also (Vishnevskii, 1987). 
Definition 1.2. 
We shall say that the solution u(x,t;uo) 
is qua-
sistabilized, if ct>(u0) consists only of stationary (not depending on t) 
solutions of the problem. 
Definition 1.3. 
We shall say that the solution u(x, t\ u0) is stabi-
lized, if cu(u0) consists only of a unique stationary solution. 
The following statement holds (Zelenyak, 1968, 1977; Belonosov and 
Zelenyak, 1975): 
Theorem 1.1. 
Let u(x, t; u0) solve problem (1.1)-(1.3) and be uni-
formly by t > 0 bounded in C^O, 1]. Then the solution u(x,t]u0) 
is 
stabilized.

solutions

Remark 
1.1. 
As it was noted, for the above assumptions, 
u(x,t;uo) 
£ C3+Q[0,1], and its limit for t —• oo may be taken in the 
norm of this space. 
First, let us prove some auxiliary statements. 
Lemma 1.3. 
Let a(x), b(x), f(x) 
be continuous for χ Ε [0,1]; and 
α, β, 7, δ, öi, ö2 be constants, α2 + β2 = y2 + δ2 = 1. Let u(x) solve the 
problem 
Lu = uxx + aux + bu = / , 
Z\U = aux + ßu\x=0 = öl, 
z2u = ηηχ + διι\χ=1 = ö2, 
and s(a:) φ 0 be such that 
ι 
Ls — z\s — Z2S = 0, J u · sdx = 0. 
0 
Then there exists a constant Κ depending only on sup |a|, sup \b\, α, β, 
7, δ such that 
ll«t 2 2<A'{||/|| i 2+|0i| + |02|}, 
Κ — Κ (—, —, sup |α|, sup 161 ] . 
(1-6) 
7 
/ 
Proof. 
Set 
u = θχ[αχ + β]{2χ3 - 3χ2 + 1) + ν(χ) + θ2 [(χ - 1)7 + δ] {-2χ3 
+ 3χ2). 
It is easy to show that 
Lv = fu 
ZiV = 0, 

132 
T.I.Zelenyak,

and 
M.P.Vishnevskii 
where 
w f i L ^ K i m + m + u L , , 
and K\ depends only on a, b. Consider the solution of the Cauchy 
problem 
L v x = h , 
ü l(0) = üi(0) = 0. 
Then 
II «1 IL 2 2<A- 2{||/|| i 2 + N + N } , 
where Κ 2 depends only on sup |a|, sup 
We have zxvx = 0. 
Then ν — v\ = w satisfies the equation 
Lw = 0, 
z\w = 0. 
As s φ 0, then w and s are linearly dependent (otherwise, all solutions 
of the homogeneous equation would satisfy the condition Z\w = 0): 
w = cs, where c is a constant. 
Finally, for the function u we obtain 
V = V\ + CS, 
U = (li — v) + V\ + CS — V\ + V2 + cs, 
where V2 is a fourth degree polynomial in χ with the coefficients linearly 
dependent on 0;.

The behavior of solutions 
135 
Proof 
of theorem 1.1. By lemma 8.2 (Belonosov and Zelenyak, 
1975) each partial limit of u(x,t) 
is a stationary solution. Further, (see 
theorem 1.3) we shall give the proof of this result for the more general 
case. To simplify calculations, we shall take the boundary conditions 
with « ο Φ 0. Consider the problem 
Let 
b(x, ν, υ') 
α(χ, v, v')' 
= μ, 
vx 
x=0 
x=0 
= 
—~ψο{μ)· 
Οίο 
(1.7) 
μι = limii(0,£), 
μ2 = lim u(Q, t). 
i—oo 
If μι = μ2, then all partial limits of u(x, t) coincide, since they all solve 
(1.7) and μχ = μ2 = μ. The functions ν(χ,μ) 
for μι < μ < μ2 satisfy 
also the boundary condition 
Really, let 
α\νχ + νι(υ)| Ι = 1 = 0. 
As |it(x, ί)|20+2 is bounded, we may choose such a subsequence tik that 
u(x,tik) 
converges in C2+/3 with β < α, where the limit is a stationary 
solution, i.e., it satisfies (1.7) and the boundary condition for χ = 1. 
The function ν(χ,μ), 
evidently, is differentiate by the parameter,

ral normalization connected with the boundary conditions, we may use 
lemma 1.3. For all t £ Π(ίο, 
the equation Nß^w

geneous boundary conditions (1.11) has a nontrivial solution Uß\ß=fl^ty

for all r; consequently, υ ( χ , μ ^ are not partial limits of the solution 
of problem (1.1)-(1.3). Compactness of the solution in C2+/3 and its 
convergence in L2 complete the proof of the theorem. 
Theorem 1.1 reflects one of the basic qualitative properties of a 
problem (1.1)-(1.3) solution - stabilization over extended time. 
However, for an equation with many spatial variables this theorem 
becomes false. In later chapter we shall consider examples which show 
that it is so. 
Now we shall point out the basic properties of the problem which 
were used when we proved theorem 1.1. 
1. The problem has Liapunov functional. This allows us to establish 
the quasistabilization of bounded in C 1 solution. Analogous results are 
known in the theory of dynamic systems of the form xt = \ / f ( x ) . Qua-
sistabilization of solution, bounded in a corresponding norm, as will be 
shown below, is the corollary of the existence of the Liapunov func-
tional in wide class of mixed problems for multidimensional parabolic 
equations and systems. 
2. When we have the continuum set of stationary solutions, these 
solutions compose of a one-parameter set. The problem linearized 011 

144 
T.I.Zelenyak, 
M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. 
and 
M.P.Vishnevskii 
the functions of this set has the trivial eigenvalue of unit multiplicity. 
The proof may be extended for the following case. 
The stationary 
solutions of the problem form a fc-parameter smooth manifold in a 
Banach space, where the linearization of the infinitesimal operator of 
the corresponding semi-group on these solutions leads to the selfadjoint 
elliptic operator (since the regular Liapunov functional exists). This 
operator has the zero as the spectrum point of multiplicity k. 
The method which is based on these properties allows us to consider 
the problem of which data depend on time explicitly and converge to 
their limits for t —• oo with a certain speed. 
We shall give without proof, the theorem on stabilization of the 
nonautonomous problem (Provorova, 1969, 1973; Zelenyak, 1972). 
Consider the problem 
p(x,u,ux,t)ut 
= Φη - 
(1-29)

(1.30)

(Provorova, 1973) Let condition (1.31) hold for 
η = 0; and F, ρ be smooth functions. 
Then each partial limit of

solution of problem (1.29)-(1.30) solves 
the equation

and satisfies conditions (1.30). If (1.31) holds for η = 1, then there 
exists the limit of this solution for t —• oo. 
The proof of this theorem is analogous to the proof of theorem 
1.1. In this case, the following modification of lemma 1.4 is used (it is 
derived from Fokin M.V.).

Now we shall prove the important corollary of the existence of

Theorem 1.3. 
Let u(x,t) G H2+a(Q) solve (1.32) and be uni-
formly bounded in this norm. Then the solution u(x,t) is quasistabi-
lized. 
Proof. 
Let i?o(x) belong to the ω-limit set of u(x,t), i.e., there 
exists such a sequence tn —> oo that u(x, tn) —> t>o(z) in C2+a(ft). Prove 
that u0(a;) is a stationary solution of (1.32). Consider the sequence 
w, t(x,t) = u(x,tn + t) for (x,t) G KT = Ω X [0, τ]. 
This sequence is bounded in H2+a(KT), 
and therefore, is compact in 
H 2 + a (KT) 
(a' < a). Taking a converging subsequence (saving the 
notations), we obtain that the limit function

This is possible only when vjt(x,t)

The theorem is 
proved. 
Remark 1.2. 
This proof does not require the local solvability 
of the problem. In particular, the theorem holds for equations which 
are not normally parabolic, for example, for degenerate equations and 
for the equations with inverse time (the equations where the leading 
coefficients are negative Α < ÜQ < 0). 
The following corollary of theorem 1.3 holds.

Theorem 1.4. 
Let u(x,t) 
£ H2+a(Q) 
be a solution of problem 
(1.1)-(1.3), uniformly by t > 0 bounded in C2+a[0,1], which has the 
Liapunov functional (definition 1.1, §2.1), and the coefficient a of equa-
tion optionally satisfied (1.4). 
Then the solution u(x,t) is quasistabilized. 
If, in addition, one of the two following conditions hold: 
1) the problem has no more than a countable number of stationary 
solutions; 
2) the function a is separated from zero; 
then the solution u(x,t) is stabilized. 
Stabilization in the case of a countable set of stationary solutions 
is the corollary of connectedness of the partial limits set. This follows 
from the theorem conditions (from the supposed smoothness of the 
solution). 
Stabilization for nondegenerate function a (as it may be negative) 
is established similar to the theorem 1.1 proof. 
Corollary 1.1. 
Under the theorem 1.4 conditions for α φ 0 the 
bounded for t £ (—oo,+oo) solution of (1.1)-(1.3) may be only a con-
nected orbit (the definition of the connected orbit see in Brunovsky and 
Fiedler, 1988, 1989). 
To illustrate the proved theorem let us give some examples. 
Example 1.2. 
Consider the problem 
Λ 
ut = — a'{ux) + f(u), 
(1.34) 
w(0, t) = u(l, t) = 0, 
u(x, 0) = uo(x). 
The function a"(η) £ C1 is assumed to be alternating, asymptotically 
positive for large |r/|. Not repeating the results of chapter 2, we refer 
to this possibility of application of theorems 1.3, 1.4. 
It is easy to show (Lar'kin et al., 1983) that the sufficiently smooth 
solution of (1.34) satisfies the identity

where F is a primitive for / . 
By theorem 1.3, the smooth solution of this problem is quasistabi-
lized. 
Example 1.3. 
Here we shall consider the so-called Cahn-Hilliard 
equation which is not of the form (1.1)-(1.3). However, the existence of 
the Liapunov functional allows us to repeat the proof of theorem 1.3. 
Let us formulate the results obtained. Consider the problem 
ut = -~fu x x x x + (a'(-ixx))r, 
(1.35) 
7uxxx(i,t) 
- a'(ux(i,t)) 
— ux(i,t) 
= 0, 
i = 0,1; 
ii(x,0) = ito(z), 
where the function a is taken from example 1.2. If we denote v(x, t) = 
ux(x,t), 
then this problem is easily reduced to the Cahn-Hilliard prob-
lem (Elliot and French, 1989) suggested by Cahn and Hilliard (1958) to 
describe the process of the phase separation in a cooling binary metal 
solution. The solution of this problem, the existence of which is estab-
lished in the standard way, has some interesting qualitative properties. 
They have been obtained both numerically and theoretically (Alikakos 
et al., 1991; Bates and Zheng Songmu, 1992; Furihata et al.: 1993). 
Note that the existence theorem for this problem considered as the 
regularization of (1.34) was proved by Zelenyak et α/.( 1974). 
We confine ourself to formulate the analog of theorem 1.3. 
It is easy to see that problem (1.35) has a Liapunov functional of 
the form 
<2 1 
«2 
J j u2
tdxdt = - J 
+ 
a(ux))dx

Therefore, the following theorem holds.

Let u(x,t) 
be uniformly by t > 0 bounded in the 
C4+a{0,1] 
norm and solve (1.35). Then u(x,t) 
is quasistabilized. 
If, problem (1.35) has no more than a countable set of stationary 
solutions, then u(x,t) 
is stabilized. 
Thus, the existence of the Liapunov functional, allows us to inves-
tigate the behavior of solution for extended time. 
§3.2 
The discrete Liapunov functional. 
Theorem 1.1 on stabilization of (1.1)-(1.3) solutions was proved by Ze-
lenyak (1968) by means of the Liapunov functional (1.6). Begining 
with Matano (1978), mathematicians began to use the so-called dis-
crete Liapunov functionals. This method makes use of the maximum 
principle and of the fact that the problem is one-dimensional. 
It turns out (Matano, 1978, 1979, 1982; Angenent, 1988) that if 
u(x,t]u0) 
is a sufficiently smooth solution of (1.1)-(1.3), then for each 
t > 0 the number of intersections zy(t) of its chart with the chart of 
each stationary solution y(x) is finite and does not increase when t 
grows. So the number of intersections is a nonnegative function with 
respect to time attaining for t > 0 the natural values. This function is 
called a discrete Liapunov functional. 
The number of sign changes for a function φ(χ) we shall denote by 
z(<p). 
For the discrete Liapunov functional, the following statements hold. 
Let v(x, t) solve the boundary-value problem for the linear parabolic 
equation with one spatial variable 
vt = d(x, t)vxx + g(x, t)vx + c{x, t)v, 
(2.1) 
<*iVx(i, t) - ßi(t)v(i,t) 
= 0, 
i — 1,0, 
v(x, 0) = v0(x), 
where 
υ0(χ) e ^ [ ο , ι ] , 
d(x,t) e C2(Q), 
d(x,t)>d0>o, 
ff(x,t), 
gt(x,t), 
gx(x,t), 
c(x,t) e 
L^C(Q). 

The behavior of solutions 
151 
(The definition of L^C(Q) may be taken, for example, from Ladyzhen-
skaya et α/.(1967)). 
Theorem 2.1. 
(Angenent, 1988). 
Let the above assumptions 
hold. Then the number of sign changes of z(v(x,t)) 
possesses the fol-
lowing properties. 
1) z(v(x,t)) 
is finite for each t > 0 (even if the number of sign 
changes z(v(x,t)) 
possesses the following properties ζ(υο(χ)) = oo). 
2) z(x(x,t)) 
is strictly decreasing in the point t = to > 0 if and 
only if v(x,to) 
φ 0, χ —> v(x,to) has a multiple zero in a certain point 
XQ £ (0,1). This denotes that v(xo,to) = vx(xo,to) — 0. 
3) If v(x,to) = 0, then v(x,t) ξ 0 for each t. 
Now we consider equation (1.1)-(1.3) which was considered in §1 
with all the suppositions which were made there. Then, the following 
theorem holds (it is the corollary of theorem 2.1). 
Theorem 2.2. 
Let u(x,t;nl), 
u(x,t-,ul), 
ul(x) φ u^(x) be two 
solutions of problem (1.1)-(1.3). Then 
1) z(u(x,t;ul) 
— u(x, t; 
is finite for t > 0; 
2) ζ (tt(£, ί; UQ) — u(x,t',UQ)^ does not increase for t > 0; 
3) there exists t0 > 0 such that for t > t0 
z(u(x, Z; uj) — u(x, t; T/Q)) 
is constant; 
4) the properties 1) - 3) hold true if instead of 
t; uJ) — u(x, t·, UQ) 
we consider ut(x,t-,uo)i ut φ 0 (in this case the nonlinear terms have 
to be sufficiently smooth). 
The existence of the discrete Liapunov functional for the parabolic 
problem (like the existence of the Liapunov functionals set) is the basic 
property of the problem. These properties allow us to make some proofs 
clearer. We shall point out those problems which become more evident 
from the point of view of these concepts. 
The following theorem holds (Belonosov and Zelenyak, 1975; Provo-
rova, 1969). 
Theorem 2.3. 
Let for problem (1.1)-(1.3) condition (B) hold (see 
definition 1.2 from §2.1) u,u 0 e Cx[0,1]. 

152

Then there exists such Τ (finite or infinite), that the solution 
t) 
belongs to H2+ot(QT), 
and one of two properties holds 
i) lim sup |u(x,i)| = oo. 
ii) The solution u(x,t) 
is determined for allf > 0 and is stabilized. 
This means that such a stationary solution 
exists that 
|| u(x,t) — v(x) ΙΙ2+Λ—0 
for 
t —• 00. 
R e m a r k 2.1. 
This statement is the corollary of theorem 3.1 (chap-
ter 2) and theorem 1.1 of this chapter. 
The proof of the theorem requires the derivatives (we know, only, 
that |u| is bounded) and estimates of this could not be realized by 
means of the discrete functional only. When we have to estimate the 
rate of convergence of a solution, or when we consider problems with 
time dependent coefficients (Belonosov and Zelenyak, 1975; Provorova, 
1969), the discrete functional method is useless. 
It seems to be impossible to apply the discrete functionals method 
for the problems with one spatial variable, when the maximum principle 
does not hold (for example, theorem 1.3 and the Cahn-Hilliard equa-
tion, example 1.3), or to the equations with many spatial variables. For 
the problems with many spatial variables, similarly (Matano, 1978), we 
may define the number of sign changes for solutions only in particular 
cases. But simple geometric considerations show that to establish the 
monotonicity of this value, we have essential difficulties. 
It should be noted that the first results obtained by this method 
were weaker than in theorem 1.1 (Matano, 1978, 1979). Furthermore, 
the cases considered were different from those in theorem 1.1: the sta-
bilization of the solution of the periodically time-dependent problem to 
the periodic solution with the same period (Brunovskii et αϊ., 1992); 
or with the periodic boundary conditions (Fiedler and Mallet-Paret, 
1989). 
The following theorem gives the answer to the problem posed by 
Zelenyak (1972) and is the corollary of the statement formulated by 
Angenent (1988) and by Brunovskii et al.{ 1992). Similar results may 
be obtained by means of functional (1.5), chapter 2. 
Suppose, for simplicity, a,b,ipi € C4 by all their arguments. 

The behavior of solutions 
153 
Theorem 2.4. 
For the solution u(x, t; u0) of (1.1)-(1.3) one of the 
following statements holds. 
i) There exists such Τ > 0 (finite or infinite) that 
lim || u(x,t; u0) ||i= oo; 
ii) The solution u(x,t;u0) 
is uniformly bounded by t > 0 in the 
space C2+a[0,1] 
and is stabilized for t —> oo (has a limit for t —> oo 
which is a stationary solution of the problem). 
Remark 2.2. 
Theorem 2.4 becomes a trivial corollary of theorem 
1.1 if i) is replaced as follows 
i') there exists such Τ > 0 (finite or infinite) that 
lim || u(x,t]iio) 
||i= oo. 
Remark 2.3. 
The theorem conditions do not include condition 
(.Β) (definition 1.2, §2.1). 
Before we prove the theorem we must formulate a corollary. 
Corollary 2.1. 
Let u(x,t-,u0) 
be a classic solution of (1.1)-(1.3) 
determined for alH > 0 and 
lim || u(x,t-,u0) 
||i< oo. 
ί—τ 
Then the solution u(.T,i;u0) is stabilized by the norm C 2 + a[0,l]. 
Corollary 2.2. 
Let all the suppositions of theorem 2.4 hold and 
u(x, t]u0) be a bounded in C 1 ^ ) solution of (1.1)-(1.3). Then u(x, i; Uo) 
is stabilized for t —> +oo. 
Remark 2.4. 
Note, that when we prove theorem 2.4 or corollary 
2.2 we do not need the existence of the Liapunov functional. Therefore, 
it is not necessary that the condition (B) holds. 
In the proof of theorem 2.4 we shall use the following result (An-
genent, 1988; Brunovskii et, al., 1992). 

154 
T.I.Zelenyak, 
M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. 
and 
M.P.Vishnevskii 
Theorem 2.5. 
Let functions <i, dt, dx, ο?^, g, 
gXJ c(x,t) 
be 
continuous in Q = [0,1] x [0, +oo); d(x,t) > d0 > 0 and either for i — 0 
or for i = l the boundary condition has the form 
v(i,t)= 
0 
(a,· = 0, 
ßi{t) = 1). 
Then, either v(x,t) 
= 0, or there exists such t* that for t > t* the 
solution v(x,t) 
of the problem (2.1) for given i satisfies the inequality 
vx(i,t) 
φ 0. 
Remark 2.5. 
In the papers of Angenent (1988) and Brunovskii 
et α/.(1992) this result is formulated also for arbitrary boundary condi-
tions from (2.1). Then, starting with a certain t* in the corresponding 
part of the boundary the inequality v(i,t) φ 0 holds. The conditions 
imposed by the authors do not require the uniform boundedness by t 
of equation coefficients and their derivatives. Then, for the case of the 
third boundary conditions α; φ 0, ßi φ 0 (Brunovskii, et αϊ. 1992) the 
uniform boundedness of ßi(t) is required in the space C^fO, oo). This 
restriction may easily be overcome by the change 
w(x,t) = 
v(x,t)e{t~x)ß'. 
This change, saving the solution value in the considered part of the 
boundary turns the condition vx(i,t) 
= ß{(t)v(i,t) 
into the homoge-
neous condition wx(i,t) 
= 0. 
Proof 
of theorem 2.4. We shall give the proof for the case of 
the first boundary-value problem, and point out the differences for the 
other boundary conditions. 
By lemma 1.1, if the solution exists only for a finite time t 6 (0,T), 
then 
lim || u(x,t;uo) 
||i= oo. 
Hence, by lemma 1.1, we have 

The behavior of solutions 
155 
lim || u(x,t; i/o) ||i= oo. 
t—τ 
This proves the statement i) of the theorem. 
So, let the solution u(x,t;u0) 
be determined for all t > 0 and 
lim || u(x,t-,uo) 
||i= oo. 
t—>oo 
(In the case when the upper limit is bounded the stabilization follows 
from theorem 1.1). Taking into account the additional smoothness of 
coefficients, we see that u(x,t]iio) 
Ε C4+0f[0,1] for t > 0 (Belonosov 
and Zelenyak, 1975; Ladyzhenskaya and Ural'tseva, 1986). As we are 
interested in the behavior of solutions for extended time, without loss 
of generality, we shall consider that u G C4+a[0,1] for t > 0. 
By the theorem supposition, there exists a finite partial limit 
t>o(a:) = lim 
ij; Mo)j where the sequence of norms || u(:r, 
u0) IU 
t—»-oo 
is uniformly bounded. Then, by lemma 1.2, there exists a partial limit 
υ0(ζ) e C 3 + a[0,1], where 
II u(:r, t f , U0) - V0(x) ||2+a ^ o. 
(2.2) 
By the change of the desired function w — u —ν ο this element of the 
ω-limit set turns into zero. Further, we shall assume that 0 € u;(ti0)· 
The derivative ut(x,t;uo), 
evidently, solves the problem (2.1) with 
d(x,t) 
= a(x, u(x, t; Uo), ur(x, t; «ο)), 
β 
g(x, t) = 
w, ux)uxx 
+ b(x, u, 
, 
(2.3) 
c(x,t) = —(a(x,u,ux)uxx 
+ 
b(x,u,ux)y 
Therefore, by theorem 2.5, for sufficiently large t > Γ, ux-i(0, t\u0) 
φ 
0. This means that ι^(0, t\it0) is monotone (in the cases of another 
boundary conditions, the function u(0,i;ito) will be monotone). Then, 
from the existence of the trivial partial limit, it follows that 

156 
T.I.Zelenyak, M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. and M.P. Vishnevskij 
lim tix(0, t) = 0. 
(2.4) 
t—>oo 
In particular, it follows that ω(η0) consists of the functions φ(χ) 
such that 
φ(0) = /(Ο) = 0. 
(2.5) 
For a fixed positive τ consider in the rectangle QT = [0,1] x [0, r] 
a functional sequence {u(x, i,· + t] t/o)}· By the theorem on continuous 
dependence of solution on initial data in QT, this sequence converges 
in the norm of C2+Cl to a solution of (1.1)-(1.3) with the initial data 
u(x,t; 0) (see (2.2)). Moreover, by (2.5), we have the additional bound-
ary condition 
u(0,f;0) = 0, 
«*((),<; 0) = 0. 
Consider again the derivative w(x,t) 
= ut(x,t] 0) determined in 
which solves the linear problem (2.1) with the additional boundary 
condition wx(x, t) = 0. As was shown by Angenent (1988), it is possible 
only in the case when 
w(x,t) — Ut(x,t] 0) Ξ 0. 
Thus, taking into account the boundary conditions, we have 
u(x, t; 0) ξ 0 
in 
QT, 
i.e., the function fo(^) (see (2.3)) is a stationary solution of initial 
problem (1.1)-(1.3). 
Analogously we may prove that each element of the ω-limit set is a 
stationary solution. As the Cauchy problem for the ordinary differential 
equation has a unique solution, it denotes (take into account (2.5)) that 
u>(uo) consists of a unique trivial element, i.e., the solution u(x, 
u0) is 
stabilized. 

The behavior 
of 
solutions 
157 
We prove now that u(x,t;u0) 
is bounded in Cx[0,1] uniformly by 
t, and hence it will follow that u(x,t;uo) 
is bounded in the C3+Of[0,1] 
norm. Consider the sequence 
u(x,tn]Uo) 
—> 0 
for 
tn —> oo 
and the intervals [tn-i,tn]. 
If the solution (smooth in each rectangle of 
a finite height T) does not tend to 0 in the C^O, 1] norm for t —> oo, 
then such ε > 0, τη Ε [/n_i,£„] exist that 
II u(x,rn; 
u0) ||1= ε, 
(2.6) 
|| u(x,t\u0) 
||ι< ε 
for 
t € [tn~i, τη). 
Then, by lemma 1.1, in Pn — [0,1] χ [i„_i,rn] the inequalities 
II u(x,t-,n0) 
||2P;a< Ce 
hold. Therefore, we may choose from {«(a;, rn; u 0)} a converging subse-
quence. This subsequence must converge to 0 (as it was shown above, 
ω(ΐί0) = {0}), which contradicts (2.6). Thus, u(x,t;u0) 
is uniformly 
bounded by t in the space C1[0,1]. The theorem is proved.

Qualitative properties of mixed prob-

In this paragraph we shall state the behavior of mixed problem global 
solutions, i.e., we shall describe the attraction domains of stationary so-
lutions, and the properties of solutions near the boundary of its domain 
of definition. We shall formulate some statements about the number of 
stationary solutions of mixed problems. 
We shall assume that the coefficients are smooth (see §3.1), and also 
that the condition (Β) holds (definition 1.2, §2.1).

The following lemma holds. 
Lemma 3.1. 
(Akramov and Zelenyak; 1975) Let the zero be the 
asymptotically stable solution of each of the problems in question. Let 
= 
y2(Vk,a2) = 0 for 
0 
< ... < f„ < 1, 
0 < ηχ < ... < 7?m < 1, 
Qfc > 0. 
Then there exist not less than η + 1 solutions of (3.6), (3.2); not less

solutions 
159 
than m + 1 solutions of (3.6), (3.3); and not less than m solutions of 
(3.6), (3.4). 
Before we prove the lemma we need one auxiliary statement. This 
statement deals with the behavior of Liapunov functionals in the neigh-
borhoods of stationary solutions; namely, it is the criterion of asymp-
totic stability of solutions to the following problem. 
Let 
ut = p(x)uxx

(3.11) 
Let ρ > po > 0, 
ςτ, r, ρ' be continuous functions; ρο,α,β 
be constants. 
Setting u — pw, where 
ρ = g - ^ F ^ M i + o ) -
we obtain for w that conditions (3.9)-(3.11) transform into conditions 
of the same form with a = — 1, 
β = 1. 
Therefore, without loss 
of generality we may take a — — 1, 
β = 1, since the property of 
asymptotic stability of the trivial solution is saved under this change. 
T h e o r e m 3.1. 
(Zelenyak, 1977). The asymptotic stability of solu-
tions to the above problems in C 1 is equivalent to each of the conditions 
below. 
1. 
The operator L spectrum determined on the functions which 
satisfy the corresponding boundary condition is negative.

2. In the case of conditions (3.9) there exists a solution ρ > 0 of 
the equation Lp = 0. For conditions (3.10), we have, in addition, px + 
ap\x=Q < 0. For conditions (3.11), this solution satisfies the inequalities 
px + αρ 
< 0, 
ρχ + βρ 
x = 0 
> 0. 
3. There exist functions μ, > 0, ρ > 0 and constants ct\,ß\ > 0 
such that the corresponding problem has the Liapunov functional in 
the integral form. This means that for each solution we have 
J μιu2dx 
= - a i u 2 ( 0 , i ) - ßxu2(l,t) 
- j 
p2{pu)2xdx. 
This theorem will be considered in the more general form in chapter 
4; therefore, its proof will be omitted now. 
P r o o f 
of lemma 3.1. The lemma suppositions and theorem 3.1 
yield that yica(x,a) 
> 0 for χ > 0, and for sufficiently small a. There-
fore, t/jt(x,a) > 0 for sufficiently small a > 0. If t/k(Ι,α) > 0 for all 
a, 
0 < a < Qk, then yk(x,a) has no zeros. Really, if qq is such that 
> 0 for 0 < α < α0, yic((,aο) = 0, then by the continuity of yk 
by its arguments, for the interior point if, we have 
V'kt{iia o) = o, 
i.e., yk(x,cxo) Ξ 0, as a solution of (3.11) satisfying the trivial initial 
data in the point ξ. By assumption, y = 0 also solves this equation; 
therefore, we obtain a contradiction since 
yi(0,a o) = ao, 
2/2(0, a 0 ) = <*0, 
α 0 ^ 0. 
The function yk(x,a) in a neighborhood of its zero, which is an 
interior point of the interval [0,1] changes the sign. By its continuity, 
for a' sufficiently close to a, the number of sign changes of the function 
yk(x, 
may differ from the number of changes of the function yk(x, <*) 
only if yk{Ι,α) 
= 0. As yk(x,a) 
> 0 for small a, it follows that if α 

The behavior 
of 
solutions 
161 
changes from 0 up to Qk, the function t/i(l,a) has not less than η + 1 
zeros, and the function 1/2(1,0) has not less than (m + 1) zeros. So, 
the statement of the lemma relative to problems (3.1), (3.2) and (3.1), 
(3.3) is proved. 
Consider the function (see condition (3.4)) 
θ(α) = 
ν'2(1,α)-φ(ν2(1,α)). 
Theorem 3.1 yields y2a|a=o > 0, i.e., 1/2 is positive for small positive 
a. 
Therefore, the function 0(a) for a, which changes from 0 up to 
c*2, becomes zero not less than m times. Really, we have proved that 
J/2(1, A) = 0 for 0 < ßi < ... 
< ßm < ct2- 
Let for α < ßk and α 
sufficiently close to ßk we have 
y 2 ( l , a ) < 0 , 
y'2(l,ßk) 
< 0, 
and for ο1 > ßk and small |a — ßk\ we have t/2(l,<*) > 0. 
Then the 
number of zeros of the function y2(x,a) 
for a > ßk, 
|o — ßk\ being 
small, is less than the number of zeros of the function y2{x, 
ßk)· 
Really, the number of zeros of the function y2(x, a) is not less than 
the number of zeros being inside the interval [0,1] of the function 
y2(x,ßk). 
We have y2(Ι,α) 
> 0 for a > ßk and small |a — ßk\, and 
since 
y2{x,a) 
- 
2 / 2 ( 1 , α ) 
= 
ν'2{θ,α)(χ 
- 
1 ) 
> 
0 , 
then, near the point χ = 1 for α close to ßk, we have y2(x,a) 
> 0. 
Consequently, the number of zeros of the function y2(x,a) 
for a > ßk 
and a — ßk being small is less on the unit than the number of zeros of 
the function y2(x,ßk). 
The analogous situation holds if 
2/2(1, a) > 0, 
y'2(l,ß:)>0 
for small a — ßj < 0: the number of zeros of the function y2{\,ßj) 
is 
greater on the unit than the number of zeros of the function 
y2(x,a) 
for a > ßj, if for α > ßj and small a — ß3 we have y2(l,a) 
< 0.

Let β-ι be such that 
2/2(l,Ä) = 0, 
y2(Ι,α) 
> 0 
for 0 < α < βι. Then, evidently, y'2{)-,ß\) < 0, since in the point χ = 1 
the function y2 obtains its minimal value. Let, further, βι,...,β3 
be 
such that 
y2( 1 , β ) = 0, 
sgnyi(l,^) = ( - l Ϋ 
and the functions y2(x,ßj) 
have exactly j zeros. 
Then, if for each 
ö 0 > ßj for which ^ ( l ^ o ) = 0 we have sgny^l^o) = ( — 1)J, then 
for each α > ßj the function y2(x,a) 
may have no more than j zeros. 
Therefore, without loss of generality we may consider that 
s g n ^ ( l , ß ) = ( —1)J, 
y2( 1,βά) = 0, j < 
m. 
But then sgn#(/?j) = ( — 1)·' for j = 1,... ,m — 1. By the lemma 
supposition 0'(O) > 0 (see theorem 3.1), therefore, the function 0(a) 
has no less than m zeros. The lemma is proved. 
Corollary 3.1. 
When we prove the lemma, we have established, 
in addition, that either the zero is the unique stationary solution, or 
there exists such βι > 0 that yk(x,ßi) > 0, where yk satisfies the 
corresponding boundary conditions. By analogous considerations, we 
obtain that for β < 0 there exists such β2 < 0 that yk(x, β2) < 0 satisfies 
the boundary conditions. If such β2 does not exist, then yk(x,ß) < 0 
for all negative β. 
Lemma 3.2. 
Let the zero be an asymptotically stable solution of 
the problem in question. Suppose we know that there are no nonneg-
ative solutions which satisfy the boundary conditions. Then for each 
function UQ € C 1 ([0,1]) satisfying one of the boundary conditions (3.2), 
(3.3), (3.4), there exists yk(x,a) satisfying for χ = 0 the same condition 
as UQ and such that 

The 
behavior 
of 
solutions 
163 
yk(x, a) > u0(x) 
for 
χ > 0. 
(3.12) 
Proof. 
Firstly, consider the first boundary-value problem. By the 
lemma supposition 
i/1(l,|a|)>0 = uo(l). 
Really, the trivial solution is asymptotically stable, and, therefore, 
j/ia(a;,0) > 0. 
There are no other solutions which are nonnegative 
and satisfy the boundary conditions. Therefore, yi(l,|a|) > 0. Sup-
pose, there is no α such that (3.12) holds. Then, for each α > 0 the 
function 
v(ar,a) = y i { x , a ) 
- 
u 0 ( x ) 
is such that 
υ(0, α ) 
= 0, 
u(l, a ) 
> 0, 
ν(ξ, 
a ) 
< 0 
for a certain 0 < ξ < 1. 
Consequently, there exists such //(a) that 
v. 
χ=η 
= 
0 , 
ν ( η ( α ) , α ) 
< 
0 . 
From the solvability "as a whole" of the Cauchy problem for (3.6) it 
follows that 
\y[\ + 2/i —> oo, 
for 
a —• oo 
uniformly by x. In the points η {a) we have 
|y!l + yi < k'l + Ι«όΙ + ν + u 0, 
i.e., (|yi| + J/i) \χ=η does not tend to oo for a —» oo. 
This contradiction proves the lemma in the case of the first boun-
dary-value problem. 

1 6 4 
T.I.Zelenyak, 
M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. 
and 
M.P.Vishnevskii 
Let uq satisfy condition (3.3). For sufficiently large α we have 
v ( x , α) 
= 
y2(x, 
a ) - 
u 0 ( x ) , 
v(0, 
a ) = a - ito(0) > 0, 
v(l,a) = J/2(1, a) > 0. 
Therefore, either v ( x , a ) > 0 for all x, or there exists such a point 
η(α) 
that 
ν'(η,α) 
= 
0, 
ν ( η , α ) < 0 . 
This means that (\y'2\ + 1/2) \χ=η does not tend to infinity for α —> oo. 
In the case of the problem (3.6), (3.4) the condition of stability of 
the trivial solution leads to the inequality (by theorem 3.1) 
θ{α) 
> 0 , 
α 
> 0 , 
θ = 
ν ' 2 - φ { ν 2 ) 
If we have no positive stationary solutions, then θ > 0 for all α > 0. 
Let uq £ C 1 satisfy boundary condition (3.4). Consider the function 
υ ( ζ , α ) = 
y2{x,oc) 
- 
u 0 ( x ) . 
For large values of α we have 
υ(0,α) = α - wo(0) > 0. 
We must show that 
l i m 
y 2 ( l , a ) = 
0 0 . 
a—too 
Assume the contrary. Then there exists such a sequence a,·, that 
2/2(1,0;) < M, <*,·-• 00, 
3/3(1,0;) -> - 0 0 . 
Really, if it is not so, then 
y 2 { l , o t i ) 
+00, 
i.e., 
miny2(l,α,·) < 
Μ 

The behavior of solutions 
165 
is attained in the interior point ξ, since for large a, we have 
y2{Ο,α,·) = oii > M. 
Consequently, there exists such 
that 
= 0, 
ν < M, 
and (\y'2\ + y2) |ξ(α) does not tend to infinity if a t —> oo. 
We have 
θ(α{) 
< 0 for sufficiently large a t, 
0(0) = 0, 
0(l/at·) > 0, i.e., 
θ attains, also, positive values. This means that such a0 exists that 
#(ao) = 0. This ao corresponds to a positive stationary solution, which 
contradicts the lemma supposition. The lemma is proved, since from 
lim t/2( 1, o) 
oo 
a—>oo 
it follows that for large a we have 
y(0, a) > 0 
u(l, a) > 0; 
and if v(x, a) is not positive for each a, then its minimum is nonpositive. 
Therefore, for each a there exists such £(a) that ι>χ|ξ = 0, υ|ξ < 0 and 
Is/2 I +V2< |«ό| + Uo, 
which contradicts the solvability condition "as a whole" for the Cauchy 
problem. 
Remark 3.1. 
Without essential change we may obtain the analog 
of lemma 3.1 for negative a. More precisely, one of the following cases 
is possible. 
1). For each Uo(x) £ C1, which satisfies the boundary condition, 
there exists such α < 0, that for the corresponding yk(x,a) we have 
yk{x,ct) < u0(x).

2). 
There exists such α0 < 0 that yk(x,a0) < 0 and 
satisfies the corresponding boundary condition in the point χ — 1, i.e., 
there exists a nonpositive nontrivial stationary solution. 
Definition 3.1. 
The set M{y) is called by the attraction 
domain 
of the stationary solution of one of the problems in question if for each 
Uq £ M(v) there exists a solution u(x,t) of this problem such that

lim ||

In contrast to dynamic systems in Rn the problem of describing 
M(v) is rather difficult. We shall prove the theorems which characterize 
the essential part of M(v), namely, M(v) f] C1. The following theorem 
was established in Akramov and Zelenyak (1975) for the first boundary-
value problem. 
Recall, that we assume the condition (B) from chapter 2 still holds. 
Theorem 3.2. 
Let υ(χ) be an asymptotically stable stationary so-
lution of the problem (1.1)-(1.3). Then one of the following statements 
holds. 
a). There exist functions 1^.(2), which are stationary solutions of 
the problem, such that 
ΤΑ = {u0, Vi < Uo < v2 
for 0 < X < 1} f l C1 C

The behavior of solutions 
167 
The sign of equality in a), b), c) may be only in those points χ — i of the 
boundary, where the conditions u(i, t) — 0 hold. In this case we assume 
0 
that u'0(i) ^ 
vk{i)· 
Here C1 is the space of continuously differentiable 
functions satisfying the corresponding boundary conditions. 
The theorem analogous to theorem 3.2 for somewhat different sup-
positions will be proved in chapter 5 for the general quasilinear para-
bolic equation with many spatial variables. 
To prove theorem 3.2 we shall need the following comparison theo-
rem (Peterson and Maple, 1966). 
Theorem 3.3. 
Let u, ν be continuously differentiable functions 
by their arguments for 0 < χ < 1, 
0 < t < T; 
F(x,t,u,ux,urx) 
be 
continuously differentiable, FUxx > δ > 0 with a certain δ. Let 
u(z,0) > υ(ι,Ο) 
for 
0 < χ < 1, 
u*(0,i) = /i(u(0,<)), 
ux{l,t) 
= 
f2{u{l,t)), 
vx{0,t) 
= 9i{v(0,t)), 
vx{l,t) 
=g2(v{l,t)), 
where /,·, gi are continuously differentiable and 
fi{u)<gi{u), 
f2(u)>g2(u). 
If for all (z,<) 
F(x, t, ν, vx, vxx) — vt> 
F(x, t, u, ux, uxx) - Ui, 
then for these (x,t) we have 
t) < u{x, t). 
The inequality will remain, if one or both boundary conditions are 
replaced by the inequality u — υ|Γ > 0 .

The function w, evidently, does not achieve in the boundary points

the inequality u — v\x=i > 0, then the theorem, evidently, will remain 
valid. 
Consider the problem (1.1)-(1.3). Assume that there exists a sta-
tionary solution v{x). Consider the first boundary-value problem. Ev-
idently, v(x) = y(x,ao), 
where ao is one of the roots of equation 
By the theorem on continuous dependence of the Cauchy problem solu-
tion on initial data (we do not assume its solvability "as a whole") for 
a, sufficiently close to a 0, the function y(x,a) 
is defined and is twice 
continuously differentiable by χ in the interval [0,1], where ya, yxa, 
yxxa 
are continuous. Without loss of generality we may assume that v(x) = 
0, a ο = 0. Let now yQ > 0 for 0 < χ < 1, |α| < ε. For χ, α; we have

From theorem 1.1, chapter 2 for the solution of our problem, we have 
the estimate 
II UA. Ili0·1^ C (R,+ II «A. Ili 0^), 
Ri =11 uo ||i0,1) . 
(3.14) 
Taking || u0 Hj0'1' sufficiently small we may deduce that solution of 
(3.13) would be a solution of (1.1)-(1.3) 
uK(x, 
t) = u(x, 
t). 
Thus, the trivial solution is stable by Liapunov: by each ε > 0, we may 
find such £(ε) > 0 that if 
u0 | | Γ < δ{ε), 
then 
|| u ||iu,1'< £· 
(0,1). 
Asymptotic stability of this solution follows from the results of chapter

the form 
wt = a(;r,0, 0)Lw,

x = l = 0. 
As the spectrum of L is negative, then the trivial solution of (1.1)-(1.3) 
is asymptotically stable. If ya|ft=o changes sign, then there exists such 
Χι that ya\Xl 
= 0, and, by the Sturm theorem, each solution of the 
equation Lw = 0 vanishes. Hence follows the existence of a positive 
eigenvalue of L, and also of the problem 
a(x, 
0 , 0 ) L w = 
\w, 
w 
x=0 
= 
w 
x—l 
= 0. 
From the results of chapter 1 it follows that the trivial solution is un-
stable. 
To investigate the critical cases we need the following lemma, which 
immediately follows from theorem 1.3. 
Lemma 3.3. 
Let u, ux, 
ut, 
uxx, 
uxt, 
uxxt, 
be continuous for 0 < χ < 
1, 0 < t < oo, where 
u 
(0,1) 
2+ct 
< 
K. 
Let u solve equation (1.1) and one of the conditions (1.2) hold. Then 
each partial limit 
l i m 
u(x,t{) 
11—•OO 
is a stationary solution of the corresponding mixed problem. 
Suppose for 0 < a < ε, 0 < χ < 1 we have ya > 0. 
Then the 
trivial solution is semi-stable: if || u0 
is sufficiently small, 0 < 
Wo < 
y(x,e), 
then || u(x,t) 
is small for all t > 0, and it is easy 
to show that || u(x,t) 
113°'1 ^ is bounded for t > 0. Then, by lemma 3.3, 
u(x,t) 
is stabilized. By the maximum principle 

172 
T.I.Zelenyak, M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. 
and M.P. Vishnevskij 
0 < u(x, t) < y(x, ε) 
and each partial limit is a stationary solution. But the unique station-
ary solution satisfying the boundary conditions and being between 0 
and y(x,e) is zero. 
Now, for ε > α > 0, let ya > 0. Then for such a we have y(x, a) > 0. 
But y(x, a) for positive α, 
a < ε could not be zero in an interior 
point, since then, it will be the point of minimum, y'x — 0, and by 
the uniqueness theorem, y = 0. Therefore, it is only possible that 
such c*i —» 0, 
> 0 exist that ι/(1,α,·) = 0. In this case the trivial 
solution, evidently, could not be asymptotically stable, since in each 
of its neighborhoods there exist other stationary solutions. But this is 
semi-stable, since from 
0 < « o < 
y(x,cti) 
it follows that 
0 < u(x, t) < y(x, a{). 
If ya changes sign for each a > 0, a < ε for a certain ε, then the trivial 
solution is unstable. Really, then, there exists such a t —> 0 that 
y(x,at) 
> 0 
for 
0 < χ < £,·, 
y(x,ai)<0 
for & < χ < ηχ. 
Let UQ(x) be such that u'0(x) > 0 and 
ul
0{x)>y(x,on) 
for 
0 < χ < 
where 
lim || 
0. 
t—*oo 
Corresponding solutions to these initial data could not converge to 
the zero since 
u\x,t) 
> 0, 
ul(x, t) > y(x, cti). 

The behavior of solutions 
173 
All ul(x,t) 
are going from the sufficiently small zero neighborhood, 
otherwise, they all would be stabilized to the close to zero nonnega-
tive stationary solutions which satisfy the boundary conditions. 
But 
in a sufficiently small zero neighborhood there are no such stationary 
solutions. Repeating the same considerations for α < 0, we obtain the 
analogous result. 
Now consider the boundary conditions 
ux - <p(u) 
=0; 
ux — φ(ιι) 
x=0 
i=l = 0. 
Let y(x,a) 
be such that 
ay" + b = 0, 
y(0,a) = a, 
y'(0, a) = 
φ(α). 
Consider the equation 
y ' ( l , a ) = 
il>(y(l,a)). 
As earlier, assume that y(x, 0) ξ 0. Then t/>(0) = 0 and y(x, 0) ξ 0. 
Let 
> 0, 
|α| < ε. 
χ=ϊ 
There exist such c*i > 0, a 2 < 0 that 
wher ;e 
y{x,a2) 
< 0 < 
y(x,ax), 
θ(α) = 
ν'(1,α)-ψ(ν(1,α)) 
is such that 0(<*i) > 0, θ{α2) 
< 0. Really, if y(^a2) 
= t/(£i,ai) = 0 in 
the interior point then 
dy(,

dy

But 
y(x,a2) 
= y(x,aι) 
ξ

y(l,a2) 
< 2/(1,αϊ), 
ϊ/(0,α2) < 2/(0,«!).

For the solution u(x,t) 
we obtain the estimates 
y{x,a2) 
< u(x,t) 
< 
y(x,ai). 
If we assume that in a certain neighborhood of zero there are no station-
ary solutions satisfying the boundary conditions, then the asymptotic 
stability of solution u = 0 is obtained analogously. This holds also if, 
for α sufficiently small, but not equal to zero, we have θ[α) ^ 0. If 
there exists a subsequence a n such that θ(αη) = 0, a n —* 0 then the 
solution is stable but not asymptotically stable. 
Now let yQ 
> 0 and such a n —> 0 exist that θ'(αη) 
< 0. We shall 
assume that ocn > 0 (the case an < 0 may be considered analogously) 
for all n. There exists such βη -> 0 that θ(βη) < 0, 
θ\βη) < 0, 

The behavior of solutions 
175 
where βη > 0 (otherwise, θ(β) > 0 for small positive β). Consider the 
sequence of smooth functions Uq(x) such that 
lim || uS ||10,1)= 0, 
Uq > 0, 
un
0>y(x,ßn) 
and use theorem 3.3 for the corresponding solution un(x,t) 
where u

x=\

i.e., the trivial solution could not be asymptotically stable. If θ'(β) < 0 
for 0 < / ? < £ , then this solution is unstable, since in the sufficiently 
small neighborhood of zero there are no positive stationary solutions of 
the problem. For semi-stability in this case it is necessary and sufficient 
that there exist positive stationary solutions with an arbitrary small 
norm. But then 0(0) = 0, $'(0) = 0 and, evidently, ya\x=o could not 
a = 0 
vanish, i.e., yQ > 0. It remains to consider the case when ya changes 
sign. Linearizing the problem in the neighborhood of zero, we obtain 
the equation 
wt = a(x, 0,0)Lw, 
where w satisfies the conditions 
w — ip'(0)w 
= w' — ψ'[0)ιυ 
= 0, 
x=0 
x=l 
and L is determined by (3.15).

then there exists at least one positive eigenvalue of the operator aL, 
since the solution constructed by positive initial data 
> y0 a=0 
could not converge by the maximum principle to a stationary solution. 
Therefore, it converges to infinity for t —> oo. In this case, w0 may-
be chosen satisfying the boundary conditions since ya satisfies these 
conditions. 
If Ö'(O) 
0 then the unique stationary solution satisfying the bo-
undary conditions is the trivial solution. 
If positive eigenvalues are 
absent, then, by theorem 3.1, there exists such p(x) that

Let

y i ( 0 , a ) = 0 , 
yi(0,a) = a. 
1) In order that the trivial solution of (1.1)-(1.2) with conditions 
u| x = 0 = u\x=\ = 0 be asymptotically stable in C1 it is necessary and 
sufficient that 
Vic Q = 0 > 0 
and

ay'i + b = 0, 
y2{0,α)

2) In order that the trivial solution of (1.1)-(1.2) with the condition

( - l ) f c y 2 ( l , ( - l ) f c | a | )

for small α ψ 0.

ux -

178 
T.I.Zelenyak, 
M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr.

M.P.Vishnevskii 
be asymptotically stable in C1 it is necessary and sufficient that 
y2a 
> 0 , 
(-l)ke((-l)k\a\)>0 
O f — U 
for small a. 
4) In order that the trivial solution of the corresponding problem be 
stable but not asymptotically stable it is necessary and sufficient that 
for each ε > 0 there exist ^i(x), u2(:r) satisfying the equation and the 
boundary conditions so that V\ > 0;υ2 < 0; |υ,·| < ε. 
Theorem 3.4 and theorem 3.1 chapter 2 yield the following state-
ment. 
Theorem 3.5. 
Let the condition ( Β ) (definition 1.2, §2.1) hold. 
Then the conditions of theorem 3.4 are necessary and sufficient for 
stability in the following sense: for each ε there exists such δ(ε) that if 
u0ec\ 
|| rxo Ι Ι Γ ^ «(ε), 
then 
II u(x,t) 
||ο°'^< ε, 
u(x,t)ec^\ 
t > 0, 
where u(x,t) 
solves the problem and u(a;,0) = txoi^)· 
If conditions of theorem 3.4, which are related to asymptotical sta-
bility, hold, then, in addition, 
u(x, t) —> 0, 
t 
oo 
by the C2 norm. 
Proof. 
As when proving theorem 3.4 we may estimate the solu-
tion. From theorem 1.1 chapter 2, it follows that the smooth solution 
is bounded in C1. 
It suffices to show the existence "as a whole" of 
the mixed problem solution by the initial data from C 1 if we know 
the a priori estimate. Approximate uο by a sequence of smooth so-
lutions choosing them so that they lie between stationary solutions of 
the problem. As follows from the theorem 3.4 proof, this is possible. 

The behavior of solutions 
179 
Then for corresponding solutions we have the estimate in C 1 uniform 
by t. Moreover, for each δ > 0 the sequence of solutions is bounded 
in C 3 for t > δ and, therefore, it converges in C2 to the solution of 
our problem (since from the maximum principle, the uniqueness of this 
solution follows). Thus, theorem 3.5 is the corollary of theorem 3.4, 
theorem 1.1 chapter 2, and of the local solvability of the corresponding 
problems from smooth initial data. 
Consider the example which illustrates the theorems 3.4, 3.5. 
Example 3.1. 
(Zelenyak and Slin'ko, 1977a, b). The following 
equation

u

is often met in chemical technology. Here, Λ is a parameter, f(u) 
> 0. 
Set 
a:=0 - 0, 
V 
x=0 
- V0 
and consider the solution of equation 
fxx + λ f(v) 
= 0 
with these initial conditions. Denote it by 
As the function 
f ( v ) is supposed to be nonnegative for λ > 0, 
ι>0 < 0 there are 
no solutions such that υ(1,υ0, λ) = 0. Let vo > 0. Then 
v(x,v0,\) 
monotonically decreases and for a certain £(A) we have υ(ξ,νο, A) = 0. 
Consequently, the function ν(χξ, vo, Αχ/£2) is a stationary solution of 
our problem for A = Αχ. Set vx = φ(ν) 
(recall that the function ν is 
monotone). Then, for a fixed A we have 
t,M - ψψ\ 
^φ2)' 
= -Af(v), 
ψ2(ν) = —2A J 
/(ξ)άξ, 
vo 
and since φ < 0, then

Thus, the initial data for the stationary solution may be determined

Let f(v)

f(V)

Then the equation 
F(vo)

and this function differs from A'(0, i>o) = F'(Vo) by the positive multi-

then d v / d v o has no more that one zero. Hence follows that the corre-
sponding stationary solution to υ0 is asymptotically stable if F'(Vο) > 0 
and is unstable if F'(vq) 
< 0. The critical case is F'(vo) 
= 0. Now we 
may apply theorem 3.5, since from the maximum principle it follows 
that if 0 < u0 < V then for the solution of the nonstationary problem 
we have 0 < ΙΙ < V. If all zeros of the equation F(v0) = \/2Λ are 
isolated then the stability conditions coincide with the conditions of 
asymptotic stability. Therefore, the necessary and sufficient condition 
of stability in this case is the condition 
F'{v0) 
> 
0 , 
F ( a ) > 
0 > 
F ( - c t ) 
for a > 0 sufficiently small. Except for this case the stability is possible 
if only there exist such sequences

that

The analogous examples for stability criterious are in Zelenyak 
(1972). The possibility of lowering the order of the stationary equation 
in question allows us to solve the problem on stability of the station-
ary solution by simply investigating the function, the roots of which 
determine the initial data corresponding to the stationary solution. 

182 
T.I.Zelenyak, 
M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. 
and 
M.P.Vishnevskij 
In particular, in example 3.1, it turns out well if we reduce the 
problem of determining these data to solving the equation F(vo) = 
i.e., to resolve the corresponding functional equation relative to 
the parameter. 
Investigating the graph of this function we obtain the information on 
stability of stationary solutions corresponding to different parameter VQ 
values. In applications there arises the problem: of finding a stationary 
solution optimal by a certain criterion. As the example 3.1 shows, this 
problem may be essentially simplified if we investigate the properties of 
F(vo), construction of which does not require the stationary solutions 
for all x. 
Proof 
of theorem 3.2. Without loss of generality we may set ν = 
0. Let there exist such stationary solutions νk of the problems such 
that vi < 0, V2 > 0 for 0 < χ < 1, and each stationary solution w of 
the problem, such that v\ < w < V2 is trivial. The maximum principle 
(theorem 3.3) applied to t>i, i>2, u(x, t), solutions of the problem such 
that u(a;,0) = 
V\ < UQ < ν2 yields that for u(x,t) 
we have 
vi < u < V2. So, we have obtained an α priori estimate for solutions 
constructed by initial data from Ta. Theorem 1.1, chapter 2 allows 
us to obtain an α priori estimate in C1. As was done in the proof of 
theorem 3.5, we may establish that there exists a twice continuously 
differentiable solution with initial data from Ta which is uniformly by 
t > 8 bounded with its derivatives. By theorem 1.3 this solution is 
stabilized; therefore, its limit is either v\, or u2, or zero. 
Consider 
conditions (3.2). By the definition of Ta, we have 
u0(x) < v2(x), 
0 < χ < 1, 
= v2{i) = 0, 
i = 0, 1

As

2/1(0,α ) = α < α0, 
then in a certain neighborhood of zero we have 
yi{x,a') 
< v2(x), 
χ / 0. 
But j/i(l,a') > 0 for a' < o0; therefore, in the neighborhood of the 
unit we have 
yi(x,a') 
> v2{x). 
From the maximum principle it follows that 
u (x,t) < v2{x), 
n(x,t) 
< y\(x,

since y\ solves the equation and 
u(z,0) < yi(x,a'), 
u

Therefore, in the neighborhood of χ = 0 we have 
lim u(x, t) < t/i(x, a) < v2(x)] 
t—t-oo 
consequently u does not converge to v2. Analogously we may obtain 
that u does not converge to uj. In the case of condition (3.3) we have 
u0(x) < v2(x), 
0 < χ < 1

and, therefore, there exists such a' that 
wo(z) < y2(x,a'), 
a'< a0, 
u2(0) = α 0 
in a certain neighborhood of zero y2(x,ct') 
< v2(x). 
It follows from 
theorem 3.3 that u(x, t) < y2(x, a>) 
a n d v2 c a n

u(x,t). 
In the case of conditions (3.4) from uo € Ta it follows that 
u0 < v2{x) = 
y2(x-,a0) 
for all χ, 0 < χ < 1. As the trivial solution is asymptotically stable, 
then for a > 0, α < α 0 we have

for α' < α 0 sufficiently close to α0· Therefore, 
u(x,t) < y2{x,a), 
u(0,t) < a' < a0. 
Hence follows that u(x,t) can not converge to v2. Analogously we 
may prove that νχ is not the limit of u(x,t). 
Therefore, 
u(x, t) —>• 0, 
t —» 00. 
Let there be no stationary solution v2(x) of the problem such that 
v2(x) > 0 for 0 < χ < 1. From corollary 3.1 of lemma 3.1 it follows that 

The behavior

we may apply lemma 3.2. Consequently, for each uo(x) 
there exists such 
yk(x,a) 
that yk(x,a)

Apply to the functions yk(x, a), u(x, t ) 
the maximum principle. Really, in the case of problem (3.1), (3.4) we

The functions y2 and u satisfy equation (3.1); therefore, u(x,t) 
< 
y2(x,a). 
If there exists the function v\ - a stationary solution of the 
problem such that v\ < 0 for 0 < χ < 1, then for u0 Ε Ts, by analogous 
considerations we may prove that there exists the solution converging 
to zero for t —» 00. If there exists V2(x) > 0 and no stationary solu-
tions which attain negative values, then each solution u(x,t) 
such that 
u(x, 0) 6 Tc converges to zero for t —y 00. 
Finally, if the stationary solution of the problem is unique, i.e., 
yk(XfOi) satisfies both boundary conditions only for α = 0, then for the 
arbitrary initial data from C1 satisfying the boundary conditions we 
may use lemma 3.2. As a result we may obtain αχ > 0, a 2 < 0 such 
that 
yk(x,a2) 
< uQ < 
yk(x,ax) 
and, in the case of condition u|r=1 = 0, 
i/fc(l,a2) < 0, 
y * ( l , a i ) > 0 
yk satisfies the problem condition for χ =• 0. When we consider problem 
(3.1), (3.4) we have θ(α2) 
< 0, 
θ(α\) 
> 0, and, by theorem 3.3, we 
have 
yk(x,a2) 
< u(x,t) 
< yk{x,ot 1). 
Hence follows, as earlier, that u(x,t) 
is stabilized to the trivial solu-
tion (the problem has no other stationary solutions in this case). The 
theorem is proved.

When proving theorem 3.2 we have essentially used that there exists 
at least one asymptotically stable stationary solution. The following 
theorem proved by Provorova (1973) for initial data from C1 in the 
case of the first boundary-value problem (3.1), (3.2), (3.5) gives the 
description of the qualitative properties of solution "as a whole" without 
this assumption. 
Theorem 3.6. 
Let uo(x) belong to C2+a[0,1] 
and satisfy one of 
the boundary conditions in question. Then for the solution «(a;, t) of the 
corresponding boundary-value problem one of the following properties 
holds 
1) u(x,t) exists for all t > 0, t < to, where 
lim sup |u| = oo. 
χ 
Recall that we assume the condition (Β) from chapter 2 still holds. 
2) u(x,t) 
is determined for all t, and there exists such stationary 
solution v(x) that 
lim || u(x,t)-v(x) 
ll^0·1^ 0. 
t—•oo 
Proof. 
The local solvability by smooth initial data we have proved 
before. From the estimates obtained by Kruzhkov (1967, 1969a, 1972) 
it follows that if || u (if'1' is bounded for 0 < t < Τ < oo, then 
II u ( x , t ) II2+C*' is bounded for the same T. Therefore, [| u 112+0? 
bounded for all t. Really, if it is not so, then such t0 < 00 exists that 
lim II u ||! 0 , 1 )= 00. 
t—>to 11 
111 
In the first case the stabilization of solution (the property 2)) follows 
from theorem 1.3. In the second case we have the property 1). Really, 
in theorem 3.1 chapter 2, we have shown that if || u Hi0'1^ is unbounded 
in the neighborhood of finite or infinite t0, then 
lim II u ||ή 0 , 1'= oo.

The theorem is proved. 
To prove the theorem in the case when uo £ C1, it sufficies to prove 
the theorem on local solvability of the mixed problem by initial data 
from C1. For this purpose it sufficies to obtain , as we have done earlier, 
an 
α 
p r i o r i estimate of sup |u| in a certain fixed time interval. In the 
case of the first boundary-value problem such estimate follows from 
the maximum principle. In the case of conditions (3.3) and (3.4), the 
difficulty is in growth of the functions φ and φ for large values of it. If 
we suppose that φ and ψ are growing not faster than a linear function, 
the theorem condition may be weakened by considering u0 £ C1. 
Now, we shall illustrate the results obtained. 
Firstly, we show that from the asymptotic stability in the first ap-
proximation, generally speaking, does not follow the asymptotic stabil-
ity in Lp even in the case of the first boundary-value problem for an 
almost linear normally parabolic equation.

for each solution. Therefore, in each point χ of this interval one of the 
following two conditions holds 
y2 < 1, 
y2 < y'2(xo) + (1 - y2(x0))ey2(xo} 
+ 1 < Κ 
(Κ is a constant), or 
y2> 1, 
y,2<v(xo)

(y2 — i)ey2 < C. 
(y2 — ^e^2 —> oo 
for 
y2 —» oo, 
As 
then y2(x) < K, where Κ is a certain constant depending on C. Thus, 
for each solution, \y\ + 
is uniformly bounded, and the Cauchy prob-
lem is solvable "as a whole". The trivial solution of (3.17), (3.18) is 
asymptotically stable in C°, as follows from the chapter 1 results. 
Now we show that there exists a sequence of solutions of this prob-
lem so that

Thus, the solution of the problem does not continuously depend on 
initial data in Lp, ρ > 1. We have asymptotical stability by the C° 
norm, and the asymptotic stability of the trivial solution by the Lp 
norm for ρ > 1, but the trivial solution is not stable in Lp,p > 1.

that some solutions by initial data from C° (and even from C°°) do 
not converge to zero.

such stationary solutions υ,-(ζ), t>i(:r) = — v2(x) such that each solution

§3.4 
Some examples. 
In this paragraph we shall show how the obtained results may be ap-
plied for description of the structure of the stationary solutions of the 
problem and its attraction domains. Also we shall give some examples 
which will illustrate the possible situations. Except for the examples 
considered below we shall assume that for the problem (1.1)-(1.3) the 
condition ( Β ) holds (see definition 1.2, §2.1). 
Definition 4.1. 
A stationary solution of (1.1)-(1.3) v(x) 
we shall 
call stable from above (from 
below) if for each ε > 0 there exists such 
8 > 0 that for u0 Ε Ε from 
uq > ν (uo < v), 
|| uo(x) — v(x) 
||i< 8 
it follows that the solution u(x, t; w0) is determined for all t > 0, where 
II u(x,t-,u0) 
- v(x) 
||ι< ε. 
If, in addition, we know that 
lim || u(x,t] 
u0) - v ( x ) ||i= 0, 
t—>-+oo 
then v(x) will be called asymptotically 
stable from above (from 
below). 
As usual, a solution v(x) 
we shall call stable, if for each ε > 0 there 
exists such 8 > 0 that for u0 £ E, from 
II U 0(x) - v ( x ) ||i< 8 
it follows that the solution u(x,t;u 0) is determined for alH > 0 and 
|| u(x,t;u 0) — v ( x ) ||ι< ε. 
If 
lim 
|| u(x, t; u0) — v ( x ) |K= 0, 
t—»-l-oo 
then we shall call v(x) 
asymptotically 
stable. 

194 
T.I.Zelenyak, M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. 
and 
M.P.Vishnevskii 
Applying the comparison theorem, it is easy to prove that if v(x) 
is stable from above and from below, then it is stable. Analogously, 
if v(x) is asymptotically stable from above and from below, then it is 
asymptotically stable. 
The following examples clarify the role of condition (Β) (see def-
inition 1.2 chapter 2) involved in the statements of the theorems in 
the previous and current sections. This condition generalizes the well-
known Bernstein-type constraints (see for instance Ladyzhenskaya and 
Ural'tseva, 1986) that require, roughly speaking, at most quadratic 
growth of the ratio b/α in the gradient variable and allow obtaining the 
estimate for the (7Χ[0, l]-norm of a bounded solution. 
In example 4.1, condition (Β) is violated, although all solutions are 
smooth and stabilize to zero as t —> oo. At the same time, for an iso-
lated solution u(x,t), we can make condition (B) hold by extending the 
right-hand side of the equation to the exterior of the range of 
u(x,t) 
so as to have a compact support for the extention. In the following 
example the problem has unbounded solutions which cannot stabilize 
disregarding the fact that condition (Β) is valid (as well as the con-
ditions on the growth in ux). 
This relates to unboundedness of the 
solution itself. 
Observe that consition (Β) enables us to interpret the right-hand 
side of the equation as the Euler operator of some variational prob-
lem. When the corresponding Lagrangian is strictly convex in ux and 
demonstrates that the violations of one-sided boundedness of the La-
grangian of a variational problem may lead to absence of stabilization 
for a solution of the corresponding dynamical problem. 
Example 4.3 shows that the presence of unbounded solutions relates 
both to the form of the nonlinearity in the equation and to the boundary 
conditions. 
Consider the examples. 
Example 4.1. 
It is easy to see that the trivial solution of the 
problem 
ut = uxx — u3, 
u ( ± M ) = 0, 
u(x,Q) = u0(x) 
(4.1) 

The behavior of solutions 
195 
is asymptotically stable in the space C2+Q. 
Let 
be a stationary 
solution, then 
ι 
ι 
0 — J 
— v^vdx 
= — j (y2 + v4^dx, 
0 
0 
whence follows that v(x) may be only the trivial solution. 
Evidently, if 
«„(*) eE 
= {u0e 
Cl[ 0,1] : u 0(±l) = 0}, 
then the solution u(x, t\ u0) is uniformly bounded for t > 0 in the norm 
Cl[0,1]. 
Therefore, (see theorem 1.1) it is stabilized (tends to zero) for 
t —• oo. 
Further, calculations show that for each smooth positive function 
ψ (τ), the pair 
ν

At the same time, since the equation y" = y3 has the set of solutions 
y(x) 
= y/2(x — c) _ 1 destroyed for χ = c, the condition ( Β ) for this 
problem fails. 
Thus, if ( Β ) fails, all the solutions of the problem may stabilize for 
t —> oo. 
Example 4.2. 
(See also, Bernstein, 1912). As earlier, the trivial 
solution of the problem 
ut — uxx + u3, 
u ( ± l , £ ) = 0, 
u(x, 0) = 
u0(x) 
(4.2) 
is asymptotically stable (the linearized equation coincides with the heat 
conductivity equation and the problem has a negative spectrum). The 
equation which determines the stationary solutions 
w 
ι 
3 
n 
y +y 
= 0 
(4.3) 
has the first integral 
y'2 + \y4 = C. 
(4.4) 
Therefore, each solution φ(χο, χ, j/o? 3/i) of the Cauchy problem 
y(x o) = yo, 
y'{x o) = y\ 
for equation (4.3) may be extended in the whole real axis, where 
\<fx{x0,x,y0,yi)\ 
< C1/2, 
\ip(x0,x,y0,yi)\ 
< 
(2C)1/4. 

The behavior of solutions 
197 
Therefore, for problem (4.2) the condition ( B ) holds, i.e., as was proved 
above, there exists a set of Liapunov functionals and each bounded 
solution in C[— 1,1] norm is bounded in 
1,1] and is stabilized for 
t —• oo (theorem 1.1). 
Consider in detail the structure of the stationary solutions set for 
problem (4.2). By (4.4) in the neighborhood of the point x0 we have

In the points X{ — xo + i r(±(2C) 1^ 4), evidently, we have the equalities 
y(Xi)

y'{xi) 
= 0 (i = 1,2). 
In this case, in the point .Τι the function y(x) has the positive maximum, 
and in the point X2 the function y(x) has the negative minimum. By 
symmetry (see (4.3)), it follows that 
(

and the function φ is odd relative to the point (x-i + a-2)/2.

Let us construct the stationary solutions of problem (4.2). Consider 
the function φ( — 1,χ, 0, a). By the periodicity, φ(—1, - 1 + nT, 0, y\) — 
0. Set

As in this case C = y\, then

It means that all the stationary solutions of problem are as follows 
As follows from Zelenyak (1977) and Vishnevskii (1984c) the func-
tions θ±(χ, 1) lie in the boundary of the attraction domain of the sta-
tionary solution. Evidently, the oscillations of θ±(χ,η) 
increase in pro-
portion to n, and their zeros, by the periodicity, are disposed uniformly. 
All the solutions θ±(χ,η) 
for η φ 0 are unstable (Belonosov and Ze-
lenyak, 1975). 
Now, we show the existence of solutions of (4.2) which are not sta-
bilized. Choose the parameter α € (0+( — 1,1), 
— 1,2)) and consider 
such initial data UQ Ε Ε that 
for χ 6 ( — 1,1). As when α grows, the distance between the zeros of 
φ(χ) is diminished, then the graphs of the functions φ(χ) and θ+(χ, 1) 
intersect. Moreover, near the point χ = — 1 we have φ(χ) > θ+(χ, 1) and 
φ (I) < 0. From the maximum principle it follows that u(x,t) 
> φ(χ)', 
therefore, u(x,t) 
can not tend to θ+(χ, 1) for t —> oo. Each of the 
functions 
(η φ 1) has at least one zero inside the interval 
(-1,1), i.e., attains the values less than 
1). Consequently, 
θ±(χ,η) 
also can not be limits for u(x, t). 
\ 
V o 
u0(x) > φ{χ) = φ(-\,χ, 
0, α), 
u0(a:) > θ+(χ, 1) 

The behavior of solutions 
199 
Hence follows (see theorem 1.1) that the solution u(x, t) can not be 
stabilized; therefore, there exists finite or infinite Τ such that 
lim sup 
|u(a;, 
= oo. 
Remark 4.1. 
Example 4.2 shows that the result of lemma 3.1 on 
the number of stationary solutions is exact in the class of solutions with 
the bounded by the number a p derivative 
Example 4.3. 
(Vishnevskii et al., 1995). Consider the problem 
ut = uxx - xul, 
(4.5) 
u(0,<) = 0, 
Μ(Μ) = 2τγ, 
u(X,0) = uo(z)· 
(4.6) 
It is easy to verify that the equation

we see that for each smooth nonnegative function Φ the pair ρ, Φ gen-
erates the Liapunov functional (definition 1.1, §2.1) on the solutions of 
(4.5), (4.6). In other words, equation (4.5) may be rewritten as follows 
p(x,u,ux)ut 
= 4~Φηχ ~ 
αχ 
In particular, if Φ Ξ 1, equation (4.5) is equivalent to the equation 
1 
d 
ux 
For problem (4.5)-(4.6) the maximum principle holds 
sup |ti(x, i)| < sup |iio(a;)| + 27Γ. 
Therefore (see theorem 1.1), if ux is uniformly bounded for t > δ > 
0, then u is bounded in the H2+Cl norm and is stabilized to the smooth 
stationary solution of the problem. But, as follows from the form (4.8) 
of the general solution of (4.7), the oscillation of such solution does not 
exceed π. Therefore, taking into account boundary conditions (4.6), 
there are no smooth stationary solutions. 
Therefore, for a certain Τ (finite, or infinite) we have 
lim sup 
|ΐίχ(χ, t)\ = oo. 
The function w = ut satisfies the problem 
wt = wxx - 
3xu2xwx, 
u;(0, t) = u>(l, t) = 0, 
w(X, 0) = 
W O ( X ) 
- U'Q 
— 
XU'Q. 
Thus, if UQ 6 C 4 and the compatibility conditions hold, then we may 
apply to the function w the maximum principle and obtain 
Μ = I ΐίί I < Κ 
for 
0 < t < T. 

The behavior 
of 
solutions 
201 
Set u 0(x) = α s'mßx, 
where α = 27γ/ sin /?, 
β £ (π/2, π). It is easy 
to see that in the point χ = 0 the compatibility conditions hold and 
•u0(l) = 2-7Γ. The calculations show that such β* exists that 
u'q-XUQ< 0 
χ G (0,1), 
< ( l ) - u ? ( l ) = 0. 
Then, evidently, ut < 0. So, the bounded function u(x, t) monotonically 
decreases when t grows and, therefore, has a finite limit for t —» Τ in 
each point x. 
For equation (4.5) consider the problem 
u(0, t) — iiz(l, t) — tt(l, t) — 0, 
u(x, 0) = 
φ(χ), 
where ψ{χ) is a smooth function satisfying the compatibility conditions. 
Denote the solution to equation (4.5) with these initial boundary con-
ditions and φ(χ) 
= Nx by u (x,t). 
To establish the existence "as 
a whole" with respect to time, it suffices to obtain the uniform by t 
estimate for |u (x, t)\ + ^ (a:, i)|. 
Evidently, w(x,t) 
— ut (x,t) 
solves the problem 
(

w(0,t) 
= wx(l,t) 
- w(l,t) 
= 0, 
ιφτ,Ο) 
= φ"(χ) - χφ'Ά{χ) = 
-Ν3χ. 
As initial data satisfy the compatibility conditions with boundary 
values, we may apply to the function w the maximum principle, i.e., 
w(x,t) 
< 0; therefore, u (x,t) 
< Nx. 
Hence, from the maximum 
principle it follows that u (x,t) 
> 0. 
Similary, taking z(x,t) 
= ux (x,t), 
we obtain for the function ζ the 
problem

zx{0, t) = 0, 
z(l, t) = u(l, f), 
z{x, 0) = N. 
The compatibility conditions again hold; therefore, 0 < ζ < Ν. Thus, 
the estimate 
Ν , 
. 
Ν . 
. 
u (x,t) 
+ ux (x, t) < 2 Ν 
holds true, whence the solvability of the problem follows. 
Analogously we may establish the boundedness of 
-N 
|u" (X,t)\ + \ux 
(x,t)\. 
Arbitrary smooth initial data φ(χ) (v?(0) = 0) may be confined 
between two functions 
±Nx 
-Nx 
< <p(x) < Nx. 
Hence it follows that the solution with the initial function φ(χ) above 
satisfies the inequalities 
u 
(x,t) < u(x,t) 
< u 
(x,t). 
Similarly, we may restrict |ux|. Therefore, we see that there exists 
a solution uniformly bounded together with its derivatives, stabilized 
for t —> oo to the stationary solution. 
The set of stationary solution of (4.5) such that u(0, a) = 0 is the 
one-parameter set of the functions u( a) — sin - 1 (αχ). Using the second 
boundary condition we obtain 
θ(α) = (υχ - υ) 
α 
*=ι 
(1 - α 2) 1/ 2 — sin 1 α, 
where 
0(0) = 0, 
θ'{a) =

As θ (a) are monotone, the unique regular stationary solution of this 

The behavior of solutions 
203 
boundary-value problem is the trivial solution 
Ξ 0. Thus, under 
our assumptions relative to initial data φ{χ), a solution to the parabolic 
problem exists for all positive values of t and uniformly tends to zero 
with its derivatives for t —> oo, i.e., is stabilized. 
Example 4.3 shows that if the condition (B) fails, the derivative of 
a bounded solution of the parabolic problem may infinitely increase. 
Unlike the other examples, this example a) is rather simple; b) the 
right hand of the equation may be represented as the Euler-Lagrange 
equation; and c) we have a demonstration of gradient blowing-up effect 
dependence on the boundary conditions. 
Parabolic equations whose right hand side is the Euler-Lagrange 
equation for Lagrangians from examples like example 2.2 chapter 2 are 
not investigated. 
In conclusion, we may recall example 3.1 chapter 2 and note that 
the derivative may infinitely grow in the interior point χ (see example 
4.5 given below). 
For more detailes about blowing-up solutions we refer the reader to 
Samarskii et αϊ. , (1995). 
Remark. 
Note, that in this example the global attractor depends 
on the form of the boundary conditions. Note, also, that the depen-
dence of the global attractor on boundary conditions was investigated 
by Fiedler (1996). 
Example 4.4. 
(Fila and Lieberman, 1994). It was proved that 
the problem 
ut - uxx + eUx, 
u(0,i) = 0, 
u{a,t) 
= 0, 
u(x, 0) = Uo(^) 
sometimes has a bounded solution with unbounded derivative with re-
spect to x. This gradient blowing-up effect depends on the length of 
the interval. 

204 
T.I.Zelenyak, 
M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. 
and 
M.P.Vishnevskii 
In particular, it was proved (Fila and Lieberman, 1994) that for the 
equation 
where f(s) 
1) is a smooth (/ £ C2), positive, and monotone increasing function, 
2) possesses a bounded ratio f ' ( s ) / f ( s ) as s —> oo, 
3) possesses super quadratic growth at infinity 
there exists a number A, such that if α > A, for any u0, the derivative 
ux is unbounded 
for a proper Τ £ (0, oo). 
Remark 4.2. 
Let us note that a family of singular solutions to 
the ordinary differential equation y" + f(y') 
= 0 (which determines 
the steady states of the above parabolic problem) could be calculated 
directly. 
In the given example the derivative ux(x, t) grows to infinity only 
in the edge point χ = 0 (this may be proved for a number of such 
problems via the Liapunov functionals). Examples of interior gradient 
blowing-up are also available. 
Example 4.5. 
(Angenent and Fila, to appear). A class of semi-
linear equations with bounded solutions whose derivative blows-up in 
finite time in the interior of the interval ( — 1,1) is as follows

§3.5 
Some qualitative properties of dissi-
pative boundary-value problems for 
quasilinear parabolic equations with 
one spatial variable. 
The so-called dissipative problems are often met both in theory and in 
practice (see, for example, Samarskii et αϊ. , 1995). 
Definition 5.1. 
We say that problem (1.1)-(1.3) is dissipative if 
such Ro > 0 exists that for each UQ 6 Ε (C^-functions which satisfy 
the compatibility conditions) the solution u(x, t; uo) is determined for 
all t > 0 and the inequality 
lim || u(x,t-,u0) 
||0< R 
(5-1) 
(—>00 
holds. 
Note, that estimate (5.1) and the condition (Β) (see definition 1.2, 
§2.1) provide uniform boundedness of solution u(x,t-,u0) 
in C 1 [0,1]. 
Then, by lemma 1.1, 
II u(x,t-u0) 
||3+Ω< R3 
(5.2) 
holds for t > to > 0, where t0 depends on || Uo ||ι· 
Definition 5.2. 
A set M(v) 
C Ε is said to be the attraction 
domain of a stationary solution v(x), if for each uq € M(v) for t —• oo 
we have 
|| u(x,t]u0) 
- v(x) ||ι—>· 0. 
(5.3) 

206 
T.I.Zelenyak, M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. 
and 
M.P.Vishnevskii 
Note some peculiarities of dissipative problems which simplify the 
analysis of the stationary solutions set and clarify its properties. 
Theorem 5.1. 
(Vishnevskij 1984, 1990). Let problem (1.1)-(1.3) 
be dissipative. Then it has the maximal stationary solution f m a x(x) 
(this means that every other stationary solution v(x) satisfies the in-
equality i)max(i) > v(x), 
χ Ε (0,1)) stable from above (definition 4.1). 
Moreover, 
M{vmD 
{u0 € E, 
u0{x) > 
x Ε [0,1]} . 
Let w(x) < vmax be a stable from above stationary solution. Then 
there exists such an unstable from below stationary solution v(x) that 
M(w) D {u0 € E, 
v(x) > u0(x) > w(x), 
χ G [0,1]}. 
Moreover, there exists a unique monotone by t solution η(χ,ί) 
deter-
mined for t Ε R which tends to v(x) for t —> —oo and tends to w(x) 
for t —> +oo. 
This theorem will be proved in a somewhat more general case in 
chapter 5. Therefore, we omit the proof. Note that in the one-dimen-
sional case instead of liminations on the growth of nonlinear terms by 
the gradient of an unknown function which will be imposed in chapter 
5 we may impose the conditions 1.2, §2.1 chapter 2. 
The analogous statement holds for the minimal stationary solution 
of the problem. 
Thus, if the dissipative problem has only a finite number of station-
ary solutions, then monotone connected orbits η(χ,ί), 
which connect 
the unstable from below (from above) stationary solution with the un-
stable from above (from below) solution naturally give the partial order 
in the set of stationary solutions. 
Note that a monotone connected orbit η(χ, t) for all t is (depending 
on its increasing or decreasing) the lower or upper function (solution) 
of the problem (Fiedler and Rocha, 1994). 

The behavior of solutions 
207 
These connected orbits (not necessarily monotone) are of great im-
portance for investigating the behavior of parabolic equations for ex-
tended time, for example, when constructing global attractors. Investi-
gation and construction of connected orbits one may find, for example, 
in Brunovsky and Fiedler (1988, 1989) and in Hartman (1970). 
Remark 5.1. 
If (1.1)-(1.3) is dissipative and functions α(χ,ξ, 
η), 
b(x, ξ, η) are analytic by 
η, then the problem has only a finite number 
of stationary solutions. 
Really, considering for simplicity the Dirichlet problem, we obtain 
that <^?(0,1, 0, a) (see definition 1.2, §2.1) is analytic by a. By the dissi-
pativity, v?(0,1,0, α) ψ 0 and c^(0,1,0, α) φ 0 for |or| > R3. Therefore, 
the .function </?(0,1, 0, a), the zeros of which determine all stationary 
solutions, may become zero only in a finite number of points. 
Consider now which properties of the structure of stationary solu-
tions set provide the dissipativity of the problem. As before, to simplify 
the calculation, consider the first boundary-value problem. 
We say that a stationary solution v(x) is quasimaximal if each sta-
tionary solution either intersects its graph or is under it for χ £ (0,1). 
Theorem 5.2. 
Let problem (1.1)-(1.3) have no more than a count-
able set of stationary solutions and suppose that the condition (Β) holds 
(definition 1.2, §2.1). 
If a quasimaximal stationary solution v(x) is unstable from above, 
then there exists such a monotone solution η(χ,ί) 
determined for all 
t (Ξ R that converges to ΰ(χ) for t —> —oo and 
limsup \η(χ, ί)| = oo, 
τ < oo. 
t rT χ 
In the case of example 4.2, the theorem states that if the quasi-
maximal solution # +(x,n) is unstable from above, then the problem 
could not be dissipative. The quasiminimal stationary solution may be 
determined analogously. 
All this allows us to prove the following theorem. 

208 
Τ. I. Zelenyak, M.M.Lavrentiev-Jr. 
and 
M.P.Vishnevskii 
Theorem 5.3. 
Let the condition (Β) hold. In order that problem 
(1.1)-(1.3) be dissipative it is necessary and sufficient that all quasimin-
imal and quasimaximal stationary solutions be stable, correspondingly, 
from above and from below. In this case the quasimaximal (quasimini-
mal) solution is maximal (minimal). This means that each of the other 
stationary solutions is strictly less (greater) than it for χ £ (0,1). 
Proof. Necessity 
follows from theorem 5.2 and from its analog 
for quasiminimal solutions. 
Sufficiency, 
(see Zelenyak, 1977). Denote by ν(χ,μ) 
the solution 
of the Cauchy problem 
a(x,v,v')v" 
+ b(x,v,v') 
= 0, 
υ(0, μ) = 0, 
υ'(0,μ) = μ 
(recall that we consider the first boundary-value problem). 
Show that for each initial data UQ G Ε which is greater than v(x) 
there exists such μ that 
ν(χ,μ) > u0(x), 
2:6(0,1). 
Then, by the comparison theorem, 
υ(χ,μ) > u(x,i;u0), 
t > 0. 
By the condition (Β) (theorem 7.2, Belonosov and Zelenyak, 1975) the 
solution it(x, t] uo) is bounded in C1[0,1] and is stabilized (theorem 1.1). 
By theorem 1.1, u(x,t-,u0) 
is stabilized to a stationary solution 
which, by the quasimaximality, coincides with v(x). By the arbitrari-
ness of uo(x) > v(x), this proves the stability from above of ύ(α·). 
Show that there exists such μ that 
ν(χ,μ) > u0(x), 
are (0,1). 
(5.4) 
Without loss of generality we may consider that ΰ(χ) = 0. Stabil-
ity from above of the trivial solution is equivalent to (Belonosov and 
Zelenyak, 1975) 

The behavior 
of 
solutions 
209 
υ μ ( ζ , 0 ) > 0 , 
a;G (0,1], 
υμ £ 0. 
As there are no positive stationary solutions, we have 
ν(\,μ) > u 0(l), 
μ > 0. 
Let for each μ inequality (5.4) be somewhere failed. Then the func-
tion ·ω(χ,μ) = ν(χ,μ) — u0(x) possesses the following properties 
w ( 0 , μ ) = 0 , 
ιν(Ι,μ) > 0, 
w(x*, μ) < 0 
(5.5) 
for all μ and for a certain χ*(μ) G (0,1). Therefore, there exists such 
χι(μ) G (0,1) that 
^(^i)Ai) 
= 0, 
w(xi, μ) < 0, 
i.e., for all μ 
νχ(χι,μ) 
= Μ0(»ι), 
ν(χ1,μ) 
< u0{xi). 
(5.6) 
The condition (Β) and nonnegativeness of ν yield 
|υχ(α·,μ)| + ϊ>(ζ,μ) —>+oo, 
μ —> oo 
(5.7) 
uniformly by χ G [0,1] (Belonosov and Zelenyak, 1975) which contra-
dicts inequalities (5.6). This proves theorem 5.3. 
In conclusion, consider the example (Zelenyak, 1977) which shows 
that monotone connected orbits η(χ,ί) 
may establish only a partial or-
der in the stationary solutions set (Vishnevskii, 1990), and the attrac-
tion domain described in theorem 3.4 (and the analogous attraction 
domains described further in chapter 5), generally speaking, are not 
uniquely defined.

(5.9) 
«(ζ,Ο) = u0{x). 
(5.10) 
The problem (5.8)-(5.10) is dissipative. Really, consider the new 
unknown function 
u(x, t) = v(x, t) cos(x/(2 + ρ)), 
ρ > 0, 
i.e., in the interval [—π, π] the multiplier is positive and is separated 
from zero. The function v(x,t)

Evidently, the problems (5.8)-(5.10) and (5.11) are dissipative simul-
taneously. Dissipativity of (5.11) follows from the comparison theorem 
and from the dissipativity of the ordinary differential equation 
By the remark 5.1 the problem has only a finite number of stationary 
solutions. It is easy to see (theorem 5.3) that stable from above and 
from below respectively quasimaximal and quasiminimal solutions are 
f m a x(:r) and Wmin(^)i i-e·, for each stationary solution υ(α;)

ZG (0,1). 

The behavior of solutions 
211 
By direct computation, we have that f m ax(^) and 
just as 
steady states v±(x) = ±sinx, are asymptotically stable. 
In Zelenyak (1977), Belonosov and Zelenyak (1975) and Akramov 
and Zelenyak (1975) it was shown that each stationary solution i s i n a : 
is connected with a pair of such unstable stationary solutions v f ( x ) 
that if 
v+(x) < u0(x) < v^ix),

x £ (—7Γ)7Γ)5 
then the solution u(x,t-,uo) 
is stabilized to sin a; (to — sin a:). 
Thus, the monotone connected orbits η(χ, t) (theorem 5.1) select at 
least three subsets of stationary solutions

{ f m a x ( i ) , V ? ( x ) , -
