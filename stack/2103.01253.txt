ON THE DUAL OF A P-ALGEBRA AND ITS COMODULES, WITH
APPLICATIONS TO COMPARISON OF SOME BOUSFIELD CLASSES
ANDREW BAKER
Abstract. In his seminal work on localisation of spectra, Ravenel initiated the study of Bous-
ﬁeld classes of spectra related to the chromatic perspective. In particular he showed that there
were inﬁnitely many distinct Bousﬁeld classes between ⟨MU⟩and ⟨S0⟩. The main topologi-
cal goal of this paper is investigate how these Bousﬁeld classes are related to that of another
classical Thom spectrum MSp, and in particular how ⟨MSp⟩is related to ⟨MU⟩.
We follow the approach of Ravenel, but adapt it using the theory of P-algebras to give
vanishing results for cohomology. Our work involves dualising and considering comodules over
duals of P-algebras; these ideas are then applied to the mod 2 Steenrod algebra and certain
subHopf algebras.

In his seminal paper on localisation [Rav84], Doug Ravenel initiated the study of Bousﬁeld
classes of spectra related to the chromatic perspective. In particular he showed that there were
inﬁnitely many distinct Bousﬁeld classes between ⟨MU⟩and ⟨S0⟩. The main topological goal

I would like to thank the following: The Max-Planck-Institut f¨ur Mathematik in Bonn for supporting my visit
in January 2020; Tobias Barthel for raising the question that motivated this work; Doug Ravenel for support
and encouragement and teaching me so much over many decades; Ken Brown and Nige Ray for numerous helpful
conversations on algebra and topology.
I would like to dedicate this paper to the memory of Pete Bousﬁeld (1941–2020) whose work on localisation
has become a central feature of modern homotopy theory.

of this paper is investigate how these Bousﬁeld classes are related to that of another classical
Thom spectrum MSp, and in particular how ⟨MSp⟩is related to ⟨MU⟩. Of course, there is a
canonical map of ring spectra MSp →MU so ⟨MSp⟩⩾⟨MU⟩. This issue is mentioned by Hovey
& Palmieri [HP99], who also say that Ravenel had outlined an argument that ⟨MSp⟩> ⟨MU⟩
but this has not appeared in print.
To achieve this we rework the algebraic machinery in Ravenel’s approach making use of the
theory of P-algebras of Moore & Peterson [MP73], subsequently developed further by Margo-
lis [Mar83]. We ﬁrst consider the dual of a P-algebra and its comodules; in order to set up
some Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequences we discuss the homological algebra required to make
a bivariant derived functor of the homomorphism for comodules with the aim of obtaining three
such spectral sequences, one of which involves dualising to modules over the P-algebra itself
because comodules do not always have resolutions by projective objects. After reviewing some
properties of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra and its dual, we discuss doubling and then describe
some families of subHopf algebras and their duals.
Moving on to topology, we introduce a
sequence of loop spaces whose colimit is equivalent to BSp and which give rise to a family of
Thom spectra whose colimit is equivalent to MSp. After describing the homology of these as
comodule algebras we move on to our main result which says that 2-locally, ⟨MSp⟩> ⟨BP⟩and
there is an inﬁnite sequence of distinct Bousﬁeld classes between ⟨S0⟩and ⟨MSp⟩.
1. P-algebras and their duals
We will make use material on P-algebras and their modules contained in [Mar83, chapter 13].
Here is a summary of assumptions and conventions.
• We will often suppress explicit mention of internal grading in cohomology and just write
M for M∗when discussing a module over A = A∗. When working in homology we will
usually write M∗or A∗.
• We will work with graded vector spaces over a ﬁeld k and in particular, k-algebras and
their (co)modules. In our topological applications, k = F2.
For a ﬁnite type graded vector space V∗we think of Vn as dual to V n = Homk(Vn, k),
so V ∗is the cohomologically graded degree-wise dual, and bounded below means that
V ∗is bounded below. We can also start with a ﬁnite type graded vector space V ∗and
form V∗where Vn = Homk(V n, k); the double dual of V∗is canonically isomorphic to
V∗, and vice versa.
A graded vector space which is ﬁnite dimensional will be referred to as a ﬁnite; when k
is ﬁnite this terminology agrees with Margolis’ use of ﬁnite module over a P-algebra.
• Recall that a P-algebra A is a union of connected cocommutative Hopf algebras A(n) ⊆
A(n + 1) ⊆A. Each A(n) is a Poincar´e duality algebra and we will denote its highest
non-trivial degree by pd(n), which is also its Poincar´e duality degree; this satisﬁes
pd(n) < pd(n + 1). In general, P-algebras are not required to be of ﬁnite type, but all
the examples we consider have that property and it is required in some of our homological
results so we will assume it holds. We also stress that each A(n) is a local graded ring
and A(n)pd(n) = A(n)0 = k. Other important properties are that A is ﬂat as a left or
right A(n)-module and a coherent k-algebra.
Of course our main examples are the Steenrod algebra A and inﬁnite dimensional
subHopf algebras.

We will use the following basic result stated on page 195 of [Mar83] but left as an exercise.
Proposition 1.1. Suppose that A is a P-algebra. Let M be a ﬁnite A-module and F a bounded
below free A-module. Then
Ext∗
A(M, F) = 0.
Proof. By [Mar83, theorem 13.12], bounded below projective A-modules are also injective, so
Exts
A(M, F) = 0 when s > 0, therefore we only have to show that HomA(M, F) = 0. It suﬃces
to prove this for the case F = A.
Suppose that 0 ̸= θ ∈HomA(M, A). The image of θ contains a simple submodule in its top
degree, so let θ(x) ̸= 0 be in this submodule; then aθ(x) = 0 for every positive degree element
a ∈A. Now for some n, θ(x) ∈A(n)k where k < pd(n), and by Poincar´e duality for A(n) there
exists z ∈A(n) for which 0 ̸= zθ(x) ∈A(n)pd(n). This gives a contradiction, hence no such θ
can exist.
□
A particular concern for us will be the situation where we have a pair of P-algebras B ⊆A
(so B is a subHopf algebra of A).
Proposition 1.2. For a pair of P-algebras B ⊆A,
Ext∗
A(A ⊗B k, A) ∼= Ext∗
B(k, A) = HomB(k, A) = 0.
Proof. First we recall a classic result of Milnor & Moore [MM65, proposition 4.9]: A is free
as a left or right B-module. This guarantees the change of rings isomorphism and the second
isomorphism follows from Proposition 1.1.
□
It is crucial that B is it self a P-algebra, for example the vanishing result does not hold if
B = A(n).
Since a P-algebra A is coherent, its ﬁnitely generated modules are its coherent modules,
and they form an abelian category with ﬁnite limits and colimits (in particular it has kernels,
cokernels and images). A coherent A-module M admits a ﬁnite presentation
A⊕k
π
/ A⊕ℓ
/ M
/ 0
which can be deﬁned over some A(n), i.e., there is a ﬁnite presentation
A(n)⊕k
π′
/ A(n)⊕ℓ
/ M′
/ 0
of A(n)-modules and a commutative diagram of A-modules

with exact rows. It is standard that every coherent A-module admits a resolution by ﬁnitely
generated free modules.
But for a P-algebra we also have injective resolutions by ﬁnitely
generated free modules.
Proposition 1.3. Let M be a coherent module over a P-algebra A. Then M admits an injective
resolution by ﬁnitely generated free modules.
3

Proof. By [Mar83, theorem 13.12], bounded below projective A-modules are injective.
For some n, M ∼= A ⊗A(n) M′ where M′ is a ﬁnitely generated A(n)-module. It is standard
that M′ admits a monomorphism M′ →J′ into a ﬁnitely generated free module (since A(n) is
a Poincar´e duality algebra this is obvious for a simple module and can be proved by induction
on dimension). By ﬂatness we can ﬁnd a monomorphism of A-modules
M
∼
=
−→A ⊗A(n) M′ →A ⊗A(n) J′
into a ﬁnitely generated free module with coherent cokernel. Iterating this we can build an
injection resolution of the stated form.
□
Proposition 1.4. Let M be a ﬁnite A-module and N a coherent A-module. Then
Ext∗
A(M, N) = 0.
Proof. By Proposition 1.3 there is an injective resolution N →J∗where each Js is a ﬁnitely
generated free module. Also, by Proposition 1.1 HomA(M, Js) = 0 and so Exts
A(M, N) = 0.
□
For example, every left A-module of the form A//A(n) = A ⊗A(n) k is coherent so it admits
such an injective resolution and Exts
A(k, A//A(n)) = 0.
The dual of a P-algebra and its comodules. The theory of P-algebras can be dualised:
given a ﬁnite type P-algebra A, we deﬁne its dual A∗by setting An = Homk(An, k) and making
this a commutative Hopf algebra.
We will refer to the dual Hopf algebra of a ﬁnite type
P-algebra as a P∗-algebra; as far as we know this is not standard terminology but it seems
appropriate.
When working with comodules over a P∗-algebra A∗we will use homological grading. For
left A∗-comodules which are bounded below and of ﬁnite type there is no signiﬁcant diﬀerence
between working with them or their (degree-wise) duals as A-modules. In particular,
CohomA∗(M∗, N∗) ∼= HomA(N ∗, M∗),
where Mn = HomF2(Mn, F2) and M∗is made into a left A-module using the antipode. More
generally,
Coexts,∗
A∗(M∗, N∗) ∼= Exts,∗
A (N ∗, M∗),
where Coexts,∗
A∗(M∗, −) denotes the right derived functor of CohomA∗(M∗, −), which can be
computed using extended comodules which are injective comodules here since we are working
over a ﬁeld.
Here are the dual versions of Propositions 1.1 and 1.2. Recall that a cofree A∗-comodule is
one of the form A∗⊗W∗.
Proposition 1.5. Suppose that A∗is a P∗-algebra. Let M∗be a ﬁnite A∗-comodule and C∗a
bounded below ﬁnite type cofree A∗-comodule. Then
Coext∗
A∗(C∗, M∗) = 0.
Proposition 1.6. For a surjective morphism of Hopf algebras A∗→B∗dual to a pair of
P-algebras B ⊆A,
Coext∗,∗
A∗(A∗, A∗□B∗k) ∼= Coext∗,∗
B∗(A∗, k) = CohomB∗(A∗, k) = 0.
4

If A∗is a P∗-algebra then we will call an A∗-comodule M∗coherent if its dual M∗is a coherent
A-module. Here is a dual version of Proposition 1.3.
Proposition 1.7. Let M∗be a coherent comodule over a P∗-algebra A∗. Then M∗admits a
resolution by ﬁnitely generated cofree comodules.
Proof. Take an injective resolution of M∗as in Proposition 1.3 and then take duals to obtain a
projective resolution.
□
Notice that since A∗is an injective comodule we have
Coext∗
A∗(A∗, A∗) ∼= Homk(A∗, k).
Proposition 1.8. Let M∗be a coherent comodule over a P∗-algebra A∗and let N∗be a ﬁnite
P∗-comodule. Then
Coext∗
A∗(M∗, N∗) = 0.
Proof. Let P•,∗→M∗→0 be a resolution of M∗by cofree comodules. Then by Proposition 1.5,
for each s ⩾0 we have
CohomA∗(Ps,∗, N∗) = 0,
and the result follows.
□
Remark 1.9. For bounded below ﬁnite type comodules over a P∗-algebra A∗dual to a P-algebra
A, taking degree-wise duals deﬁnes an equivalence of categories

between the A∗-comodule and the A-module categories. Moreover, these functors are exact, so
this equivalence identiﬁes injective comodules (which are retracts of extended comodules) with
projective modules. By [Mar83, theorem 13.12], projective A-modules are injective so it also
identiﬁes injective comodules as projective objects (this is not true in general).
In fact this equivalence ﬁts into a bigger diagram

Coext∗
A∗(−, N∗) = ExtA(N ∗, (−)∗).
Of course this is calculated using injective resolutions of A-modules; since ExtA(−, −) is a
balanced functor, (1.2) implies that Coext∗
A∗(−, −) is too, whenever we can use projective
comodule resolutions in the ﬁrst variable. For example, if we restrict to the subcategory of
coherent comodules we obtain balanced bifunctors

which we will use to construct Grothendieck spectral sequences.
2. Some homological algebra for comodules
In this section we describe some Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequences for comodules over a
commutative Hopf algebra over a ﬁeld. Some of these are similar to other examples in the
literature such as that for computing Cotor for Hopf algebroids in [Rav86].
However, the
spectral sequence that plays the biggest rˆole in our calculations is not deﬁned in the same way
but requires dualising and is a standard Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence for Ext of modules
over a ring.
To ease notation, in this section we suppress internal gradings and assume that all our objects
are connective and of ﬁnite type over a ﬁeld k. We refer to the classic [MM65] as well as the
more recent [MP12] for notation and basic ideas about graded Hopf algebras.
Suppose we have a sequence of homomorphisms of connected commutative graded Hopf
algebras over k,
K\\H ֌ H ։ K,
where in the notation of [MM65, deﬁnition 3.5],
K\\H = k□KH = H□Kk ⊆H.
We also assume given a left K\\H-comodule M and a left H-comodule N. Of course M and
N inherit structures of H-comodule and K-comodule respectively, where M is trivial as a
K-comodule. Our aim is to calculate Coext∗
H(M, N), the right derived functor of
CohomH(M, −): ComodK\\H →Modk;
N 7→CohomH(M, N).
6

Following Hovey [Hov04], we will write U
H∧V to indicate the tensor product of two H-
comodules U ⊗V = U ⊗k V with the diagonal coaction given by the composition
U ⊗V
µ⊗µ
/
,
(H ⊗U) ⊗(H ⊗V )
∼
=
/ (H ⊗H) ⊗(U ⊗V )
ϕ⊗Id
/ H ⊗(U ⊗V ).
For a vector space W, the notation U ⊗W will be used to denote H-comodule with coaction
U ⊗W
µ⊗Id
/
,
(H ⊗U) ⊗W
∼
=
/ H ⊗(U ⊗W)
carried on the ﬁrst factor alone.
If L is a left H-comodule, then there is a well-known isomorphism of left H-comodules
(2.1)
K\\H
H∧L = (H□Kk)
H∧L ∼= H□KL,
We can also regard K\\H = k□KH as a right H-comodule to form the left K\\H-comodule
(2.2)
K\\H□HL = (k□KH)□HL ∼= k□KL;
in particular, if L is a trivial K-comodule then as left K\\H-comodules,
(2.3)
K\\H□HL ∼= L.
We will use two more functors
ComodH →ComodK\\H;
N 7→K\\H□HN = (k□KH)□HN ∼= k□KN
and
ComodK\\H →Modk;
N 7→CohomK\\H(M, N).
Notice that there is a natural isomorphism
CohomK\\H(M, K\\H□H(−)) ∼= CohomH(M, −)
and for an injective H-comodule J, K\\H□HJ is an injective K\\H-comodule. This means we
are in a situation where we have a Grothendieck composite functor spectral sequence which in
this case is a form of Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence; for details see [Wei94, section 5.8] for
example.
Proposition 2.1. Let M be a left K\\H-comodule and N a left H-comodule. Then there is a
ﬁrst quadrant cohomologically indexed spectral sequence with
Es,t
2 = Coexts
K\\H(M, Cotort
K(k, N)) =⇒Coexts+t
H (M, N).
If N is a trivial K-comodule then
Es,t
2 ∼= Coexts
K\\H(M, Cotort
K(k, k)
K\\H
∧
N).
There is another spectral sequence that we will use whose construction requires that one of
the Hopf algebras involved is a P∗-algebra. The reason for this is discussed in Remark 1.9: in
the category of ﬁnite type connected comodules, extended comodules are projective objects.
7

Proposition 2.2. Assume that H and K\\H are P∗-algebras. Let M be a left H-comodule
which admits a projective resolution and let N be a left K\\H-comodule. Then there is a ﬁrst
quadrant cohomologically indexed spectral sequence with
Es,t
2 = Coexts
K\\H(Cotort
K(k, M), N) =⇒Coexts+t
H (M, N).
If M is a trivial K-comodule then
Es,t
2 ∼= Coexts
K\\H(Cotort
K(k, k)
K\\H
∧
M, N).
Proof. The construction is similar to the other one, and involves expressing CohomH(−, N) as
a composition
CohomK\\H(−, N) ◦(K\\H□H(−)) = CohomK\\H(K\\H□H(−), N) ∼= CohomH(−, N).
The functor K\\H□H(−) sends injective H-comodules to projective objects in ComodK\\H
(see Remark 1.9). Therefore the standard construction can be applied.
□
Of course the assumption that M admits a projective resolution is crucial; in the case of
P∗-algebras this amounts to working with coherent comodules.
Unfortunately, these spectral sequences are not suﬃcient for our purposes and we also need
to dualise and use a classical Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence [CE99, theorem 6.1(1)] for a
normal sequence of k-algebras
(2.4)
R →S →S//R
together with a left S//R-module L and a left S-module M. This spectral sequence has the
form
(2.5)
Es,t
2 = Exts
S//R(L, Extt
R(k, M)) =⇒Exts+t
S
(L, M),
where we have suppressed internal gradings. In our applications (2.4) will be a sequence of
cocommutative Hopf algebras.
3. The Steenrod algebra and its dual
The theory of P-algebras applies to many situations involving subHopf algebras of the Steen-
rod algebra for a prime. Of course the change of rings isomorphism of Proposition 1.2 holds
for any subalgebra where A is ﬂat over B, but the vanishing will not be true in general (for
example, when B = A(n)).
To illustrate this, here is a simple application involving the mod 2 Steenrod algebra; this
result appears in [Rav84, corollary 4.10]. We denote the mod 2 Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum
by H = HF2.
Proposition 3.1. The 2-completed BP-cohomology of H is trivial, i.e., (BPb
2)∗(H) = 0.
Proof. There is an Adams spectral sequence of form
Es,t
2 = Coexts,t
A∗(H∗(H), H∗(BP)) =⇒(BPb
2)s−t(H).
Now H∗(H) = A∗and it is well-known that as A∗-comodule algebras,
(3.1)
H∗(BP) ∼= A∗□E∗F2 = A(1)
∗
= F2[ζ2
1, . . . , ζ2
n, . . .]
8

where E∗= A∗//A(1)
∗
which is an inﬁnitely generated exterior Hopf algebra so it is a P∗-algebra.
Now by a change of rings isomorphism and Proposition 1.2,
Es,t
2 = Coexts,t
A∗(A∗, A∗□E∗F2) ∼= Coexts,t
E∗(A∗, F2) = 0.
□
Doubling. The operation of doubling has been used frequently in studying A-modules. The
reader is referred to the account of Margolis [Mar83, section 15.3] which we will use as back-
ground.
Since the dual A∗is a commutative Hopf algebra, it admits a Frobenius endomorphism
A∗→A∗which doubles degrees and has Hopf algebra cokernel
E∗= A∗//A(1)
∗
= ΛF2(ζs : s ⩾1),
where A(1)
∗
= F2[ζ2
s : s ⩾1]. Dually, there is a Verschiebung A →A which halves degrees and
satisﬁes
Sqr 7→
(
Sqr/2
if r is even,
0
if r is odd.
The kernel of this Verschiebung is the ideal generated by the Milnor primitives P0
t (t ⩾1), hence
there is a grade-halving isomorphism of Hopf algebras A//E
∼
=
−→A, where E ⊆A is the subHopf
algebra generated by the primitives P0
t and dual to the exterior quotient Hopf algebra E∗.
Given a left (graded) A-module M, we can induce an A//E-module M(1) where
Mn
(1) =
(
Mn/2
if n is even,
0
if n is odd,
and we write x(1) to indicate the element x ∈M regarded as an element of M(1); the module
structure is given by
Sqr(x(1)) =
(
(Sqr/2 x)(1)
if r is even,
0
if r is odd,
Using this construction, the category of left A-modules ModA admits an additive functor to
the category of evenly graded A//E-modules,
Φ: ModA →Modev
A//E;
M 7→M(1)
which is an isomorphism of categories. The quotient homomorphism ρ: A →A//E also induces
an additive isomorphism of categories ρ∗: Modev
A//E →Modev
A and it is often useful to consider
the composition ρ∗◦Φ: ModA →Modev
A .
By iterating Φ(1) = Φ we obtain isomorphisms
Φ(s) = Φ ◦Φ(s−1) : ModA →Mod(s)
A//E(s);
M 7→M(s)
where the codomain is the category of A//E(s)-modules concentrated in degrees divisible by 2s
and E(s) ⊆A is the subHopf algebra multiplicatively generated by the elements
Pa
b
(s ⩾a ⩾0, b ⩾1).
By doubling all three of the variables involved the following homological result is immediate
for e ⩾1 and two A-modules M, N:
Exts,2et
A(e) (M(e), N(e)) ∼= Exts,t
A (M, N).
(3.2)

Because doubling is induced using a grade changing Hopf algebra endomorphism, the double
A(1) is also a Hopf algebra isomorphic to the quotient Hopf algebra A//E and dual to the
subHopf algebra of squares A(1)
∗
⊆A∗which is also given by
A(1)
∗
= A∗□A∗//A(1)
∗F2 = F2□A∗//A(1)
∗A∗= (A∗//A(1)
∗)\\A∗.
More generally, for any s ⩾1, A(s) is isomorphic to the quotient Hopf algebra of A//E(s) dual
to the subalgebra of 2s-th powers
A(s)
∗
= (A∗//A(s)
∗)\\A∗⊆A∗.
In many ways, doubling is more transparent when viewed in terms of comodules. For an
A∗-comodule M∗, we can deﬁne a A(1)
∗-coaction µ(1) : M(1)
∗
→A(1)
∗
⊗M(1)
∗
where M(1)
∗
denotes
M∗with its degrees doubled; this is given on elements by the composition
M∗
µ
/
µ(1)
,
A∗⊗M∗
(−)2⊗Id
/ A(1)
∗
⊗M∗.
By iterating we also obtain a A(s)
∗-coaction µ(s): M(s)
∗
→A(s)
∗
⊗M(s)
∗.
Then the comodule analogue of (3.2) is
Coexts,2et
A(e)
∗(M(e)
∗, N (e)
∗) ∼= Coexts,t
A∗(M∗, N∗).
(3.3)
We can use iterated doubling combined with Proposition 1.2 to show that for any d ⩾1,
(3.4)
Coexts,t
A∗(A∗, A(d)
∗) ∼= Exts,t
A (A(d), A) = 0.
By doubling all three of the variables involved here we can also prove that for e ⩾0,

We will use this to show that (MSpb2)∗(BP) = 0 and (MSpb2)∗(H) = 0 for example.
Some families of quotient P∗-algebras of A∗. We will begin by describing some quotients
of the dual Steenrod algebra A∗. For any n ⩾1, (ζ1, . . . , ζn) ⊳A∗is a Hopf ideal so there is a
quotient Hopf algebra A∗/(ζ1, . . . , ζn) together with the subHopf algebra
P(n)∗= A∗□A∗/(ζ1,...,ζn)F2 = F2[ζ1, . . . , ζn] ⊆A∗
and in fact
A∗//P(n)∗= A∗/(ζ1, . . . , ζn).
Similarly, for any s ⩾0, the ideal (ζ2s
1 , . . . , ζ2s
n ) ⊳A∗is a Hopf ideal and there is a quotient
Hopf algebra
A∗//P(n)(s)
∗
= A∗/(ζ2s
1 , . . . , ζ2s
n )
with associated subHopf algebra
P(n)(s)
∗
= A∗□A∗//P(n)(s)
∗F2 = F2[ζ2s
1 , . . . , ζ2s
n ] ⊆A∗.
For each t ⩾0 there is a ﬁnite quotient Hopf algebra
P(n)(s)

where the limit is computed degree-wise. The graded dual Hopf algebra
P(n)(s) = (P(n)(s)
∗)∗= Hom(P(n)(s)
∗, F2)
is the colimit of the ﬁnite dual Hopf algebras
Hom(P(n)(s)

Therefore P(n)(s) is a P-algebra and P(n)(s)

4. Recollections on Ravenel’s proof
We will assume the reader is familiar with the strategy behind Ravenel’s proof of [Rav84,
theorem 3.9]. Since we will be working in a very similar situation with ring spectra which have
torsion free homology the main steps will be applicable.
Following Ravenel [Rav84, section 3], we recall that there are compatible double loop maps
ΩSU(2s) →BU deﬁned using Bott’s weak equivalence ΩSU →BU. The corresponding virtual
complex bundle on ΩSU(2s) has Thom spectrum Xs which is an E2 ring spectrum. Ravenel
shows that
⟨S0⟩= ⟨X1⟩> ⟨X2⟩> ⟨X3⟩> · · · > ⟨Xs⟩> ⟨Xs+1⟩> · · · > ⟨MU⟩.
Of course, locally at the prime 2, ⟨MU⟩= ⟨BP⟩.
We are lead to consider the question: How is ⟨MSp⟩related to ⟨MU⟩, and locally at 2, to
⟨BP⟩? Since there are maps of ring spectra MSp →MU →BP, ⟨MSp⟩⩾⟨MU⟩= ⟨BP⟩. We
will show that ⟨MSp⟩> ⟨BP⟩and also ﬁnd an analogue of the sequence of spectra Xs for MSp.
Remark 4.1. Here are observations on the proof of theorem 3.1.
Rather than taking M = M(4) to be the mod 4 Moore spectrum we suggest using the ring
spectrum M = F(M(2), M(2)) (it is even an A∞ring spectrum in a canonical way). Then
⟨M⟩⩾⟨M(2)⟩since the Moore spectrum M(2) = S0 ∪2 e1 is an M-module spectrum, while
⟨M(2)⟩⩾⟨M⟩since M ∼M(2) ∧DM(2). Therefore ⟨M⟩= ⟨M(2)⟩. Similar observations
apply to the odd prime case.
Also, for (a) and (b) the following observation seems suﬃcient. Since
(X ∧M) ∧Z ∼∗≁(Y ∧M) ∧Z
=⇒
X ∧(Z ∧M) ∼∗≁Y ∧(M ∧Z),
we have
⟨Y ∧M⟩> ⟨X ∧M⟩
=⇒
⟨Y ⟩> ⟨X⟩.
5. Some Thom spectra on loop spaces
For background to this discussion see Mimura & Toda [MT91, Chapter IV, §6]. The sequence
of spaces making up the spectrum of connected real K-theory include
kO4 ∼BSp,
kO5 ∼SU/Sp,
so there is a weak equivalence of inﬁnite loop spaces ΩSU/Sp ∼BSp. At the ﬁnite level we
have compatible loop maps
ΩSU(2n)/Sp(n) →ΩSU(2n + 2)/Sp(n + 1) →· · · →BSp
11

which deﬁne virtual symplectic bundles on these spaces and we will denote the Thom spectrum
over ΩSU(2s+1)/Sp(2s) by Ys. There is a map of E1 ring spectra Ys →MSp which induces an
injective ring homomorphism in homology.
There are also compatible loop maps ΩSU(2n) →ΩSU(2n)/Sp(n), and by pulling back
from ΩSU(2n)/Sp(n) we obtain E1 ring spectra Y ′
s over the ΩSU(2s+1) together with E1 maps
Y ′
s →Ys.
The mod 2 homology of Ys is given by
H∗(Ys) = F2[y1, y2, . . . , y2s−1],
where |yk| = 4k.
The induced homomorphism H∗(Ys) →H∗(MSp) is actually an isomor-
phism up to degree 2s+2 −4, so we can choose the generators yk so that they map to poly-
nomial generators of H∗(MSp).
In particular, we assume that each y2r−1 maps to the ele-
ment corresponding to the primitive generator in H2r+2−4(BSp+) under the Thom isomorphism
H∗(MSp)
∼
=
−→H∗(BSp+). It is well known that the coaction on these elements satisﬁes
(5.1)
ψy2r−1 =
X
0⩽k⩽r
ζ4
k ⊗y2k
2r−k−1.
Consider the ideal
Js = (y1, y3, . . . , y2s−1) ⊳H∗(Ys).
Then (5.1) implies that this is a subcomodule ideal, hence the quotient ring H∗(Ys)/Js is an
A∗-comodule algebra.
We will make use of the A∗-comodule subalgebra
P(s)(2)
∗
= F2[ζ4
1, ζ4
2, . . . , ζ4
s] ⊆A∗
and the quotient Hopf algebra A∗//P(s)(2)
∗.
Proposition 5.1. The composition
H∗(Ys)
ψ
/
1
A∗⊗H∗(Ys)
/ A∗□A∗//P(s)(2)
∗H∗(Ys)/Js
is an isomorphism of A∗-comodule algebras, therefore
H∗(Ys) ∼= (A∗□A∗//P(s)(2)
∗F2) ⊗H∗(Ys)/Js ∼= P(s)(2)
∗
⊗H∗(Ys)/Js
where H∗(Ys)/Js has trivial coaction.
In the limit this coincides with well-known isomorphisms of A∗-comodule algebras
(5.2)
H∗(MSp)
∼
=
−→A∗□A∗//A(2)
∗H∗(MSp)/J
∼
=
−→(A∗□A∗//A(2)
∗F2) ⊗H∗(MSp)/J
∼
=
−→A(2)
∗
⊗H∗(MSp)/J
where J ⊳H∗(MSp) is the comodule ideal generated by the images of all the y2r−1.
Of course the quotient Hopf algebra
A∗//A(2)
∗
= F2[ζ1, ζ2, . . .]/(ζ4
1, ζ4
2, . . . , ζ4
s)
is also inﬁnite dimensional and its dual is the cyclic A-module A(2) = A//E(2) where E(2) ⊆A
is the subHopf algebra generated by the elements Pk
t (k ⩾2, t ⩽s) in the notation of [Mar83,
section XV.1].

6. Comparison of some Bousfield classes
Now we can give our main topological results. From now on we will work 2-locally and omit
reference to this in notation, etc.
Theorem 6.1. The following inequalities for Bousﬁeld classes are satisﬁed:
⟨S0⟩= ⟨Y1⟩> ⟨Y2⟩> · · · > ⟨Ys⟩> ⟨Ys+1⟩> · · · > ⟨MSp⟩> ⟨BP⟩.
Proof. We will adopt the strategy of Ravenel’s proof for the analogous results on Xn and BP.
In particular we will make repeated use of the Adams spectral sequence.
For 2-local ﬁnite
type spectra X and Y , by [Boa99, theorem 15.6] there is a strongly convergent Adams spectral
sequence with
(6.1)
Es,t
2 (X, Y ) = Exts,t
A (H∗(Y ), H∗(X)) =⇒[X, Y b
2 ]s−t.
We can dualise to homology and use comodules to obtain another interpretation of the Ext
group:
(6.2)
Es,t
2 (X, Y ) = Coexts,t
A∗(H∗(X), H∗(Y )) =⇒[X, Y b
2 ]s−t.
Of course we know that BP is an MSp-module spectrum so ⟨MSp⟩⩾⟨BP⟩. To prove the
strict inequality we follow Ravenel and reduce to showing the triviality of the E2-term of the
Adams spectral sequence
Es,t
2 (BP, MSp) = Coexts,t
A∗(H∗(BP), H∗(MSp)) =⇒[BP, MSpb2 ]s−t.
By (5.2),
H∗(MSp) ∼= (A∗□A∗//A(2)
∗F2) ⊗H∗(MSp)/J
where H∗(MSp)/J has trivial A∗//A(2)
∗-coaction. Combining this with (3.1) we have
Es,∗
2 (BP, MSp) ∼= Coexts,∗
A∗(H∗(BP), A∗□A∗//A(2)
∗F2) ⊗H∗(MSp)/J
∼= Coexts,∗
A∗//A(2)
∗(A(1)
∗, F2) ⊗H∗(MSp)/J.
To compute the Coext term here we will dualise and use a Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence
of the form (2.5) for
Ext(A∗//A(2)
∗)∗(F2, A(1)) ∼= Coexts,∗
A∗//A(2)
∗(A(1)
∗, F2).
We will base this on the sequence of algebras
(A∗//A(1)
∗)∗
/ (A∗//A(2)
∗)∗
/ (A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗
which is dual to
A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗
→A∗//A(2)
∗
→A∗//A(1)
∗.
This spectral sequence is tri-graded with E2-term
CEEs,t
2 = Exts
(A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗(F2, Extt
(A∗//A(1)
∗)∗(F2, A(1)))
where we have suppressed mention of the internal grading. As (A∗//A(1)
∗)∗acts trivially on
A(1),
Extt
(A∗//A(1)
∗)∗(F2, A(1)) ∼= Extt
(A∗//A(1)
∗)∗(F2, F2)
(A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗
⊠
A(1),
13

where
(A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗
⊠
indicates the k-tensor product with the diagonal action of the cocommutative
Hopf algebra (A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗. Since there is a surjection of Hopf algebras
A(1)
∗
→A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗,
dually there is an injection
(A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗→(A(1)
∗)∗= A(1)
so the Milnor-Moore theorem implies that A(1) is a free (A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗-module.
Hence as
(A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗-modules,
Extt
(A∗//A(1)
∗)∗(F2, F2)
(A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗
⊠
A(1) ∼= A(1) ⊗Extt
(A∗//A(1)
∗)∗(F2, F2).
Feeding this into our E2-term we obtain
CEEs,t
2 ∼= Exts
(A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗)∗(F2, A(1)) ⊗Extt
(A∗//A(1)
∗)∗(F2, F2)
∼= Coexts
A(1)
∗//A(2)
∗(A(1)
∗, F2) ⊗Extt
(A∗//A(1)
∗)∗(F2, F2)
∼= Coexts
A∗//A(1)
∗(A∗, F2) ⊗Extt
(A∗//A(1)
∗)∗(F2, F2)
= 0
since A∗is a cofree comodule over the P∗-algebra A∗//A(1)
∗.
Now we can conclude that Es,∗
2 (BP, MSp) = 0 and so (MSpb2)∗(BP) = 0.
The rest of the proof is similar and uses the spectral sequence (2.5) to reduce to calculate
some Coext groups using the dual algebras. We will describe the main details required for these.
To verify that ⟨Yn⟩> ⟨MSp⟩the key step involves showing that
Coext∗,∗
A∗(A(2)
∗, P(n)(2)
∗) = Coext∗,∗
A∗(A(2)
∗, A∗□A∗//P(n)(2)
∗F2) = 0,
where
Coext∗,∗
A∗(A(2)
∗, A∗□A∗//P(n)(2)
∗F2) ∼= Coext∗,∗
A∗//P(n)(2)
∗(A(2)
∗, F2).
By [MP12, corollary 21.2.5], there is a sequence of Hopf algebras
A(2)
∗//P(n)(2)
∗
= (A∗//A(2)
∗)\\(A∗//P(n)(2)
∗) →A∗//P(n)(2)
∗
→A∗//A(2)
∗
whose the dual sequence of algebras gives rise to a Cartan-Eilenberg spectral sequence (2.5)
with
CEEs,t
2 ∼= Exts
A(2)(F2, Extt
(A∗//A(2)
∗)∗(F2, A(2)))
∼= Exts
A(2)(F2, Extt
(A∗//A(2)
∗)∗(F2, F2)
A(2)
⊠A(2))
∼= Exts
A(2)(F2, A(2)) ⊗Extt
(A∗//A(2)
∗)∗(F2, F2))
= 0
since A(2) is a P-algebra.
Finally, the veriﬁcation that ⟨Yn⟩> ⟨Yn+1⟩proceeds in this fashion with P(n + 1)(2)
∗
in place
of A(2)
∗
and involves the vanishing of
Coexts,4∗
P(n+1)(2)
∗//P(n)(2)
∗(P(n + 1)(2)
∗, F2) ∼= Coexts,∗
P(n+1)∗//P(n)∗(P(n + 1)∗, F2)
14

which follows from the facts that P(n+1)∗is cofree over P(n+1)∗//P(n)∗by the Milnor-Moore
theorem and the latter is a P∗-algebra.
□
As an exercise, the reader may like to rederive Ravenel’s results for BP and the Xn’s using
our approach.
There are some other interesting spectra that intermediate between MSp and BP. These
include Pengelley’s BoP [Pen82], MSU and the sequence of MSp-module spectra obtained by
killing the Ray elements ϕ(s) = ϕs ∈π2s+2−3(MSp) as described by Botvinnik [Bot92] (both
including and excluding the generator of π1(MSp)). In fact if we kill ﬁnitely many of the Ray
elements this does not change the Bousﬁeld class since they are all nilpotent, whereas if we kill all
of them we get a spectrum whose Bousﬁeld class is the same as BP; similarly, ⟨MSU⟩= ⟨BP⟩.
So there are no novel Bousﬁeld classes between ⟨MSp⟩and ⟨BP⟩stemming from these.
