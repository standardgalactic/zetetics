ABSTRACT 
Time of Puberty in Females and Cognitive Performance. 
Epiphania Osei, B. A. 
Mary Spiers, Ph.D. 
 
Biological processes associated with puberty have been researched extensively. However, 
the relationship between time of puberty in females and cognitive performance remains 
unclear. Early puberty in females is associated with “female-typical” performance 
patterns of increased accuracy in verbal and emotional cognition, and decreased 
performance accuracy in spatial cognition; whereas late puberty is associated with “male-
typical” performance of decreased accuracy in verbal and emotional cognition and 
increased accuracy in spatial cognition. One hundred and sixty-two females, aged 15- 21 
years were sampled from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort database and 
assigned to three groups; “early puberty” (8-9), “typical puberty” (10-15) and “late 
puberty” (16-18), based on age at menarche. We hypothesized that “early puberty” 
females would present “female-typical” performance patterns of increased accuracy in 
verbal and emotional cognition and decreased accuracy in spatial cognition and that “late 
puberty” females would present “male-typical” performance patterns of increased 
accuracy in spatial performance and decreased accuracy in verbal and emotional 
cognition. Multivariate analyses of variance controlling for race and ethnicity indicated 
no significant performance difference among the puberty groups; on spatial line 
orientation, visual object learning, word memory, verbal reasoning, emotional 
identification, emotional differentiation, age differentiation, conditional exclusion, letter 
n’ back and continuous performance. Regression results indicated a possible influence of 
demographic variables on female cognition. Overall, results suggest that pubertal timing 

xi 
 
has little to no effects on cognitive performance in females using the present study’s 
measures. We, however, propose that demographic variables specifically race, ethnicity, 
and parental education may influence cognitive performance in females.

CHAPTER 1: BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW 
            Research suggests that going through puberty early or late can influence cognitive 
performance on certain measures among females (Mendle, Turkheimer & Emery, 2007; 
Dubas, Graber & Petersen, 1991). Is there a relationship between this physiological 
marker in females and performance on verbal, spatial, executive functioning and 
emotional cognition measures? This study presents an avenue to examine the relationship 
between time of puberty in females and performance across a number of cognitive 
domains. 
           The following literature review examines the hormonal, physiological and 
cognitive processes underlying puberty and explores the classification of pubertal timing 
into “early," “typical” and “late”. The cognitive patterns observed in the different puberty 
groups - “male-typical” and “female-typical” are also discussed in relation to cognitive 
abilities mediated by the right hemisphere (increased spatial performance) and by the left 
hemisphere (increased verbal performance) and how these can be influenced by time of 
puberty in females. The terms “time of puberty” and “pubertal timing” were used 
interchangeably in the following literature. 
 
             1.1 Puberty in Females 
            A comprehensive exploration of puberty in females is essential to advancing the 
understanding of how its timing may relate to cognitive changes. Puberty in this paper 
refers to the onset of menarche (menstruation) in females. During puberty, there are 
increases in sex hormones leading to significant overt and covert physiological changes 

2 
 
involving primary and secondary sexual characteristics (Edlin & Golanty, 2012; 
Blakemore, Burnett & Dahl, 2010). Primary sexual characteristics describe the maturing 
ovaries, fallopian tubes and reproductive organs (Edlin & Golanty, 2012). Additionally, 
the body secretes sex hormones, estrogen and progesterone that lead to maturation of 
secondary sexual characteristics (Blakemore, Burnett & Dahl, 2010). Secondary sexual 
characteristics in females include rounder hips and curvier bodies (Edlin & Golanty, 2012; 
Davies & Shackelford, 2008).  
            The neuroendocrine system controls the initiation of puberty (Özen & Darcan, 
2011). Other factors such as food intake, environmental chemicals, health status, 
ethnicity and geographical location can also determine pubertal onset (Özen & Darcan, 
2011; Steingraber, 2007; Parent et al., 2003; Valsik, Stukovsky & Bernatova, 1963). The 
Tanner sexual maturity scale is an assessment tool for determining puberty in females 
(Rosenbloom, 1998; Marshall & Tanner, 1969). The tanner scale assesses puberty by 
charting the progress of secondary sexual characteristics such as breasts and pubic hair 
development into various maturity levels (Marshall & Tanner, 1969).  
            During puberty, hormonal events triggered in females include adrenarche and 
gonadarche (Blakemore, Burnett & Dahl, 2010; Spear, 2000). Adrenarche is the process 
whereby the hypothalamic-pituitary adrenal axis becomes very active, and it precedes the 
second hormonal event gonadarche (Blakemore, Burnett & Dahl, 2010). This is usually 
experienced between the ages of 6 years and 9 years in females (Blakemore, Burnett & 
Dahl, 2010; Auchus & Rainey, 2004). During this stage, sex hormones with 
masculinizing effects (androgens) arise from within the adrenal glands and contribute to 

3 
 
the development of other secondary sexual features that include underarm, and pubic hair 
in females (Marshall & Bangert, 2008; Auchus & Rainey, 2004). 
            The arousal of the HPG axis (hypothalamic-pituitary- gonadal axis) known as 
gonadarche equips females with the ability to become pregnant, and it’s suggested to 
establish pubertal maturation (Blakemore, Burnett & Dahl, 2010). Gonadarche usually 
begins between ages 8 and 10 years in females (Dorn, Dahl, Woodward, & Biro, 2006) 
when the hypothalamic hormone “gonadotropin-releasing hormone” (GnRH) is secreted 
into the body stimulating ovulation (Plant & Witchel, 2006). Gonadarche leads to breast 
budding (Levesque, 2012) and menstruation in females (Plant & Witchel, 2006). 
            In addition to the hormonal and physiological changes in the anatomy of females, 
other important neurological changes take place in the brain. Puberty in females is 
suggested to involve changes in the anatomy of limbic structures, such as the 
hippocampus and the amygdala (Blanton et al., 2012; Bramen et al., 2011). A study by 
Blanton and colleagues (2012), examining the association between brain anatomy and 
puberty found that an increase in sex hormones correlated with smaller right hippocampal 
size. In a similar study, progression through puberty was associated with smaller 
amygdala size (Bramen et al., 2011). Puberty rather than individuals’ age in years is 
found to be a greater predictor of changes in the brains’ anatomy in humans (Baccetti, 
Franchi, De Toffol, Ghiozzi, & Cozza, 2006). 
            In summary, the literature indicates that puberty marks various hormonal, 
physiological and cognitive changes. Increased sex hormones during puberty trigger 
significant changes such as primary and secondary sexual characteristics. Most 

4 
 
importantly, the brain undergoes anatomical changes like structural changes in the 
hippocampus and the amygdala, suggesting a relationship between puberty and cognitive 
changes. 
 
             1.2 Pubertal Timing in Females: Early, Typical and Late/Delayed 
             In the present study, puberty is defined as the onset of menarche. Pubertal timing 
is divided into three groups: “early," “typical” and “late or delayed." In the following 
paragraphs, the different pubertal groups and counterarguments to each group will be 
discussed. 
            Early puberty describes the development of primary and secondary sex 
characteristics such as breasts and body hair before the age of 8 in females (Petit & 
Adamec, 2005; Colaco, 1997). Data on the trends of pubertal timing in the United States 
were scarce until the 20th century (Sun et al., 2005). During the 1900’s, the average 
female in North America reached menarche at 14.2 years (Tanner & Eveleth, 1975); as at 
2003, the average menarche age has decreased to 12.43 years, (Chumlea et al., 2003). A 
number of researchers attribute this trend to factors such as obesity and environmental 
elements (Anderson and Must, 2005; Kaplowitz, 2006). 
           The extant literature reports a relationship between obesity and the early onset of 
puberty (Kaplowitz, 2006; He & Karlberg, 2001). He and Karlberg after examining 3650 
participants from birth to 18 years reported that greater body fat due to over nutrition in 
participants usually resulted in early puberty (He & Karlberg, 2001). However, the exact 
relationship between early puberty and obesity is unclear. Some studies indicate that 

5 
 
obesity accelerates pubertal onset in females (He & Karlberg, 2001, Freedman et al., 
2003) while others claim obesity is a consequence of early puberty (Demerath et al., 
2004). Another study argues that formula feeding in infants contributes to early pubertal 
onset in females (Novotny, Daida, Grove, Acharya & Vogt, 2003). This study conducted 
in Hawaii reported that formula-fed female infants retained more body fat as adolescents, 
and pubertal onset was notably earlier than female infants who fed on breast milk, which 
contains melatonin and fewer calories than formula (Novotny et al., 2003).  Other studies 
also indicate chemicals and pollution in the environment as possible disruptors of the 
endocrine system leading to early puberty in females (Özen & Darcan, 2011; Steingraber, 
2007). Specifically, exposure of girls to chemicals like lead and hair products containing 
hormones facilitate the early release of sex hormones that facilitate puberty, resulting in 
early pubertal onset (Denham et al., 2005; Li, Lozano, Grossman, & Graham, 2002).    
            Additionally, several studies link early puberty to stressful home environments 
(Bellis, Downing & Ashton, 2006) and fetal exposure to tobacco (Windham, Bottomley, 
Birner, & Fenster, 2004). Puberty is considered average or typical when secondary sexual 
characteristics like breast development starts around age 9, and menarche begins by 16 
years in females (Marshburn & Hurst, 2011; Gordon & Schroeder, 1995). Puberty is 
described as late or delayed if there is the absence of obvious sexual features by 13 years, 
and there is also an absence of menarche by 16 years in females (Khan & Rahman, 2011; 
Gordon & Schroeder, 1995).  In most cases, females who experience pubertal delay have 
no pathological conditions, but rather a mere coincidence that puberty was reached late; 
this is referred to as constitutional delay (Dutta, Dutta & Roy, 2011; Albanese & 
Stanhope, 1995). Other causes of pubertal delay are hypothyroidism, inability of the 

6 
 
pituitary glands to secrete necessary hormones (Speroff & Fritz, 2005) rigorous sports 
and poor nutrition (Norris, 2006). 
            In conclusion, pubertal timing can be classified into distinct groups based on 
certain sexual characteristics: “early puberty," appearance of physical sexual 
characteristics before 8 years, “typical puberty” – appearance of physical sexual features 
by 11 years and “late puberty” appearance of physical sexual characteristics after age 13 
years. 
 
1.3 Pubertal Development and Cognitive Changes in Females 
            Pubertal development and adolescence typically occur around the same time and 
cognitive development at this stage is characterized by complex brain processes 
(Blakemore et al., 2010). During this stage, thought processes are more abstract in nature 
(Lerner & Lerner, 1999), and there is the ability to think in wider perspectives in addition 
to increased understanding of societal norms and values (Spruijt-Metz, 1999). 
            Despite the overall dearth of literature on pubertal timing in females and cognitive 
performance, early puberty in females is associated with poor scholastic achievement 
after middle school (Mendle, Turkheimer & Emery, 2007). Conversely, better-academic 
performance or good grades (Dubas et al., 1991), and higher college graduation rates 
(Graber, 2004) are reported among “late puberty” females. Although late puberty is 
associated with better-academic achievement, one study reported an inverse relationship 
between late puberty in females and cognitive performance (Ryan, Carrière, Scali, 
Ritchie, & Ancelin, 2009). Ryan and colleagues observed lower performance accuracy in 

7 
 
visuospatial memory in addition to slower reaction time in participants who identified as 
reaching puberty late (Ryan et al., 2009). This study, however, did not evaluate pubertal 
timing and cognitive performance directly. Findings were reported on participants aged 
65 years and older who had received estrogen therapy throughout their lifetime. 
Additionally, the study relied on participant subjective recall of age at menarche as an 
estimate of pubertal timing. Per the study’s methodology, findings could be attributed to 
alternate explanations like a decline in the participants' memory as a result of 
advancement in age and the lifelong exposure to estrogen therapy rather than pubertal 
timing. 
            Although cognitive mechanisms underlying puberty are not fully understood, the 
literature suggests that going through puberty early or late can influence cognitive 
performance in females. Females either display a “male-typical” cognitive pattern (high 
spatial performance) or a “female-typical” cognitive pattern (low spatial performance) on 
some cognitive measures (Waber 1976). 
            To conceptualize “female-typical” and “male-typical” cognitive performance 
patterns, we explored how sex-specific behaviors seen in adults are shaped by sex 
hormones throughout the life span. Over the course of life, sex hormones sculpt the brain 
during two critical periods (Romeo, 2003). Sex hormones first organize the brain during 
fetal development i.e. before birth to distinguish sex-specific characteristics necessary for 
human adaptation (Schulz, Molenda-Figueira & Sisk, 2009; Sisk & Zehr, 2005). 
Secondly, surges in male and female sex hormones during puberty reinstitute and fine 
tune the organizational effects that the fetal brain experienced (Sisk & Zehr, 2005). This 

8 
 
process leads to specific cranial processes needed to facilitate sexually dimorphic 
activities in humans (Schulz et al., 2009). 
            In the following paragraphs, the terms “male-typical” and “female-typical” 
cognitive patterns will be discussed following two lines of evidence in the literature. The 
first is sex differences in cognitive domains. The second is cognitive performance within 
females as a group; as this is a pattern we are expected to see in “early puberty” and “late 
puberty” females. Additionally, more studies related to pubertal timing and cognitive 
patterns in women will be discussed. 
 
1.4 Sex Differences and Cognitive Patterns 
            During puberty, active sex hormones in males and females are testosterone and 
estrogen respectively (Shirtcliff, Dahl & Pollak, 2009). Optimal levels of testosterone in 
males result in a masculinized cognitive pattern, i.e. high spatial performance scores, and 
higher levels of estrogen in females result in a femininized cognitive pattern i.e. low 
spatial performance scores (Kimura, 1996; Hampson, 1990). Across the life span, 
females often demonstrate better accuracy on measures with verbal and social cognition 
components (Gur et al., 2012) than males who exhibit better accuracy on spatial 
cognition measures (Halpern et al., 2007; Gur et al., 2012).  
            Males usually outperform females on spatial tasks requiring transformations in 
visuospatial memory, such as mentally rotating three-dimensional objects (Moore & 
Johnson, 2008). Females on the other hand generally show increased performance 
accuracy on verbal memory measures (Halpern et al., 2007) particularly vocabulary and 

9 
 
verbal fluency (Kimura, 1996). Females also excel on social cognition measures like 
emotion identification, emotion intensity differentiation, age differentiation (Gur et.al, 
2012) and facial recognition (Rehnman &Herlitz, 2007). Females also demonstrate better 
writing abilities compared to males (Halpern et al., 2007). The differences between the 
typical cognitive abilities of males and females tend to present themselves as strengths in 
specific cognitive domains rather than in overall intellectual capacity (Kimura, 1992).  
            Differences in brain lateralization are suggested to lead to specific spatial abilities 
in humans (Hugdahl, Thomsen & Ersland, 2006; Vogel, Bowers & Vogel, 2003). A study 
by Vogel and colleagues (2003) examining hemispheric differences on spatial processes 
indicated that overall; males tend to use the right hemisphere significantly during spatial 
tasks, whereas females showed greater bilateral processing abilities (Vogel et al., 2003). 
Right hemisphere functions include musical abilities and visual-spatial abilities (Vogel et 
al., 2003; Young, 1984; Gordon, 1970). The higher performance accuracy observed in 
males during visuospatial tasks suggests that males utilize more of the right hemisphere 
during spatial problem-solving (Vogel et al., 2003). 
            Language abilities in males appear to be localized in the left hemisphere 
compared to females (Dorion et al., 2000; Gur et al., 2000). In females, language 
processing abilities tend to rely more on both the right and left hemispheres (Baxter et al., 
2003). On average, females perform more accurately on certain verbal tasks across the 
life span (Bornstein, Haynes, Painter & Genevro, 2000; Weiss, Kemmler, Deisenhammer, 
Fleischhacker & Delazer, 2003; Roulstone, Loader, Northstone & Beveridge, 2002) 
specifically on verbal fluency, and verbal memory (Kimura, 1996). Verbal fluency is 
usually assessed with measures evaluating the meaning of verbal problems i.e. semantic, 

10 
 
in addition to measures evaluating sound organization of verbal problems i.e. phonemic 
(Bowie et al., 2004). Phonemic or phonological fluency tasks usually require participants 
to mention a number of words that begin with particular alphabets depending on 
participants’ ability, e.g., C, J & A (Barry, Bates & Labouvie, 2008). Semantic fluency 
tasks, on the other hand, usually require participants to list a number of words from a 
certain category depending on participant’s ability e.g. living things (Bowie et al., 2004). 
 
1.5 Time of Puberty in Females and Cognitive Patterns 
             1.5.1 Spatial Cognition Performance 
            Although research exploring pubertal timing and cognitive performance are 
sparse, the majority of studies document a positive relationship between late puberty in 
females and “male-typical” cognitive pattern i.e. increased accuracy in spatial 
performance (Waber, 1976; Sanders & Soars 1986, Newcombe & Bandura, 1983, 
Diamond, Carey, & Back, 1983). Late puberty females, like males, are reported to score 
higher on spatial tasks than “early puberty” females (Hassler, 1991). Spatial abilities 
typically describe the capacity to understand, mentally manipulate and remember 
relations among objects in space (Linn & Petersen, 1985). Spatial abilities have several 
dimensions that include spatial visualization and spatial orientation (Linn & Petersen, 
1985). Spatial visualization describes the ability to imagine mentally, manipulate, rotate 
or twist visual imagery without the object’s being available (Mathewson, 1999); while 
spatial orientation includes the capacity to ascertain one's location within the environment 
(Coluccia & Louse, 2004). 

11 
 
            In Waber’s 1976 and 1977 studies on pubertal timing and cognitive performance, 
female participants completed a spatial task where they were instructed to think about 
objects in two- or three dimensions in addition to solving complex spatial problems. 
Increased performance accuracy was recorded in “late puberty” females than in “early 
puberty” females (Waber 1976, 1977). A series of follow-up studies also reported higher 
performance accuracy on spatial ability tasks in “late puberty” females than in “early 
puberty” females (Sanders & Soars 1986, Newcombe & Bandura, 1983, Diamond, Carey, 
& Back, 1983; Petersen, 1980). 
            One study that investigated spatial abilities and pubertal timing in female college 
students reported differences between “late puberty” females and “early puberty” females 
on spatial performance (Sanders & Soares, 1986). Specifically, “late puberty” females 
demonstrated high-performance accuracy on mental rotation tests than “early puberty” 
females. However, it was noted that performance differences were not observed on other 
cognitive domains (Sanders & Soares, 1986). Wirsen and colleagues in 2000 also 
reported a positive relationship between late pubertal age in females and increased spatial 
performance. This study used a spatial task that required participants to fill in a track 
comprising of as many target points as possible from a previously shown triangle’s lower 
apex to the top using keyboard keys. Results indicated that “late puberty” females 
performed more accurately than “early puberty” females on this spatial task (Wirsen, 
Tonning- Olsson & Lavender, 2000).  
            Contrary to the observed positive relationship between late pubertal age and 
increased spatial performance accuracy in females, other studies report no significant 
differences among the puberty groups and spatial performance accuracy (Geary & Gilger, 

12 
 
1989; Gilger & Ho, 1989; Newcombe, Dubas & Baenninger, 1989; Rierdan & Koff, 1984; 
Strauss & Kinsbourne, 1981). 
            Pubertal timing and spatial performance studies in females have used a variety of 
spatial measures. One study used the Shepard-Metzler Mental Rotation Test (MRT) and 
reported higher performance scores in “late puberty” females than early puberty females 
(Sanders & Soares, 1986). Other spatial measures like the Spatial Relations test 
administered as part of the Primary Mental Abilities Test (PMA) developed by Thurstone 
in 1962 and the Block Design a subset of the “WISC-R”  i.e. the Wechsler Intelligence 
Scale for Children have associated late pubertal age in females with increased 
performance accuracy on these measures (Waber, 1976, Newcombe & Bandura, 1983). A 
recent study that used the Perceptual Maze Task, (PMT) reported late puberty to be 
positively correlated with spatial performance (Wirsen Meurling, Tonning- Olsson & 
Lavender 2000). Other studies that have found no differences among the puberty groups 
on spatial performance accuracy have utilized spatial tests like the Group Embedded 
Figures test developed by Witkin and colleagues in 1971 and the Vandenberg and Kuse 
Mental rotations test (Geary & Gilger, 1989; Rierdan & Koff, 1984). 
            A suggested explanation for a maturation related performance difference in 
females may exist is brain lateralization (Waber, 1977). Waber suggested that how fast or 
how slow females took to reach puberty could influence the functional specialization of 
the brain’s hemispheres. This explanation suggests that the “male-typical” cognitive 
patterns observed in “late puberty” females result from the continual specialization of 
their brains without any interruption (puberty), allowing them to reach functional 
specialization like males (who usually reach puberty later than females and perform more 

13 
 
accurately on spatial tests). Early puberty females, on the other hand, may not reach 
functional specialization due to the sudden curtail in hemispheric lateralization due to 
early puberty (Waber, 1977). 
 
              1.5.2 Verbal Cognition Performance 
            Studies exploring the relationship between left hemisphere cognitive abilities and 
pubertal timing in females, specifically, verbal performance are few. Presently, no study 
has found performance differences among the puberty groups; “early," “typical,” and 
“late” on any verbal measure (Wirsen Meurling, Tonning- Olsson & Lavender, 2000; 
Hassler, 1991; Rierdan & Koff, 1984; Strauss & Kinsbourne, 1981; Waber 1976 & 1977). 
Commonly-used verbal measures in puberty studies are vocabulary and verbal fluency 
tests (Wirsen Meurling, Tonning- Olsson & Lavender, 2000; Sanders & Soares, 1986; 
Rierdan & Koff, 1984; Waber 1976 & 1977). A possible explanation to why these studies 
have found no differences among the puberty groups on any verbal measure could be due 
the use of verbal measures with similar themes; i.e. vocabulary, and verbal fluency tasks; 
hence no differences have been observed among the puberty groups. This could also be 
an indication that females in general score highly on vocabulary and fluency tasks across 
the life span (Bornstein et al., 2000; Weiss et al., 2003; Roulstone et al., 2002). 
            In summary, no clear association can be drawn between pubertal timing in 
females and cognitive processes. However, the literature indicates that the time females 
reach puberty may influence cognitive performance potentially altering cognitive patterns 
towards a “male-typical” (high spatial performance scores) or a “female-typical” (low 

14 
 
spatial performance scores). No differences in verbal performance have been observed 
among puberty groups. 
 
            1.5.3 Emotional Cognition Performance 
            To date, no study had investigated pubertal timing in females and emotional 
cognition performance. Therefore, it was important to explore how pubertal timing could 
be associated with emotional cognition performance. Emotional cognition abilities and 
processes are part of a bigger umbrella called social cognition (Allport, 1985) which 
describes the basic mental and emotional processes that enable people to comprehend and 
participate in day to day interactions (Adolph, 2009, Green et al., 2008; Allport, 1985). In 
the present study, emotional cognition and social cognition were used interchangeably.  
            Studies report female advantage in processing and interpreting emotional 
expressions like identifying emotions, and differentiating between emotional intensities 
as well as in recognizing faces (Gur et.al, 2012; Herlitz & Yonker, 2002). A 2012 study 
by Gur and colleagues exploring sex differences in the recognition of emotions, 
differentiating between emotional intensity in addition to the ability to tell how old a face 
indicated better performance accuracy in female participants than in male participants 
(Gur et al., 2012). 
            General research investigating human development suggest that as children grow 
older and go through adolescence, they become more cognizant of their emotions in 
addition to taking interest in knowing what others think about particular subjects 
(Wainryb, Shaw, Laupa & Smith, 2001; Richards, Crowe, Larson & Swarr, 1998). 

15 
 
According to Steinberg, it appears that early adolescence is associated with emotional 
stimulation and adventure-seeking. Middle adolescence is usually characterized by 
compromised emotions, and adolescents were mostly defenseless against potentially 
dangerous behaviors. Late adolescence is described as a stage where brain regions 
responsible for problem-solving and emotional regulation near maturation (Steinberg, 
2005). Therefore, it was of interest to this study to investigate how pubertal timing in 
females could influence emotional cognition performance. 
 
            1.5.4 Executive Functioning Performance 
            Executive functioning describes the ability to direct and have mastery over mental 
processes and actions (Goldberg, 2002; Stuss & Alexander, 2000). It includes abstraction, 
attention and working memory (Gur et al., 2012). Sex differences have been observed in 
some domains of executive functioning; e.g., females perform more accurately on 
attention tasks, and males perform more accurately at abstraction tasks (Gur et al., 2012). 
With the evidence of sex differences on some measures with executive functioning 
components, it was important to determine how pubertal timing in females could 
influence performance on measures with executive function components. 
            Executive functioning abilities are associated with the prefrontal cortex of the 
brain (Blakemore & Choudhury, 2006; Sowell, Thompson, Tessner &Toga, 2001). 
Studies indicate that the frontal cortex continues to show signs of development even after 
the twentieth year of human life (Sowell et al., 2001; Giedd et al., 1999). Others have 
suggested that immaturity of the frontal lobes is associated with emotional and 
interpersonal challenges in humans (Steinberg, 2005). Therefore, inability to be 

16 
 
successful in adjusting and adapting to various environments may be dependent on the 
level of maturity of executive functioning skills (Eslinger, Biddle & Grattan, 1997). 
            To date only one study known to the researcher has investigated pubertal timing 
in females (as measured by adrenarche) and executive functioning performance. Sontag-
Padilla and colleagues in 2012 investigated the relationship between adrenarche and 
executive function abilities, in addition to its association with psychological problems 
using psychopathological and neuropsychological tests. Results indicated that early 
puberty females (early adrenarche) that exhibited not fully developed executive skills 
were more likely to apportion blame than typical puberty females (Sontag-Padilla et al., 
2012). Attribution of blame to others was not observed in typical puberty females neither 
was it associated with executive functioning abilities in this group (Sontag-Padilla et al., 
2012). An explanation to this finding is the maturation disparity hypothesis (Ge & 
Natsuaki, 2009; Brooks-Gunn, Petersen, & Eichorn, 1985). This hypothesis purports 
those females who reached puberty earlier than their peers tended to miss certain 
developmental trajectories necessary to reaching the ideal cognitive level (Sontag-Padilla 
et al., 2012; Ge & Natsuaki, 2009; Brooks-Gunn et al., 1985). Therefore, puberty propels 
girls' transitioning from childhood to adulthood quickly exposing them to social and 
intellectual contexts way higher than their current developmental stage (Allison & Hyde, 
2013; Ge & Natsuaki, 2009) suggesting that problems could arise in the process of 
juggling both childhood and adult expectations at the same time (Caspi, Lynam, Moffitt, 
& Silva, 1993). 
            This hypothesis is congruous with suggestions that the brain’s frontal cortex 
associated with higher order functions continues to develop throughout adolescence 

17 
 
(Sowell et al., 2001; Giedd et al., 1999). Therefore, early puberty females may not be 
mentally capable of handle intellectual and psychological complexities brought on them 
by the sudden transition. To date no study has explored pubertal timing in females as 
measured by menarche and executive functioning performance. 
 
 
1.6 Statement of the Problem 
            In summary, the literature indicated possible effects of pubertal timing on female 
cognitive pattern. Females exhibited either a “male-typical” or a “female-typical” 
performance type depending on the time of puberty. Given the paucity of research into 
pubertal timing and cognition in addition to contradictory findings, the relationship 
between pubertal timing and cognitive performance remained unclear. No study to date 
had investigated the relationship between pubertal timing in females and emotional 
cognition in addition to executive functioning performance. 
            In the present study, the relationship between pubertal timing and cognitive 
performance (spatial and verbal) were investigated. Additionally, two new-cognitive 
domains, emotional cognition and executive functioning performance were explored. By 
investigating these new domains, we determined that this would expand on research in 
women’s cognitive health, in addition to helping clinicians tailor interventions to regulate 
cognitive and psychosocial problems that could arise due to the effects of pubertal timing 
on females.

1.7 Aims and Hypotheses 
 
Aim 1:  To investigate the influence of pubertal timing in females and spatial 
performance. 
            Hypothesis 1 
            Base on earlier research, we hypothesized that “late puberty” females would 
perform more accurately on the Penn Line Orientation Test (PLOT) and the Visual 
Object Learning Test (VOLT) than “early puberty” and “typical puberty” females. 
 
 
Aim 2: To explore the influence of pubertal timing in females on verbal performance. 
            Hypothesis 2 
            We hypothesized that “early puberty” females would perform more accurately on 
the Penn Word Memory Test (PWMT) and the Penn Verbal Reasoning Test (PVRT) than 
“typical puberty” and “late puberty” females although earlier studies had found no 
performance differences among the puberty groups. 
 
 
Aim 3: To examine the influence of pubertal timing in females on emotional cognition 
performances.  
            Hypothesis 3 

19 
 
            It was hypothesized that “early puberty” females would perform less accurately 
than “late puberty” and “typical puberty” females on the Penn Emotion Identification 
Test (PEIT), Penn Emotion Differentiation Test (PEDT) and the Penn Age 
Differentiation Test (PADT). 
 
 
Aim 4: To determine the influence of pubertal timing in females on executive functioning 
performances.  
            Hypothesis 4 
            We hypothesized that “early puberty” females would perform less accurately than 
“late puberty” and “typical puberty” females on the Penn Conditional Exclusion Test 
(PCET), Penn Continuous Performance Test (PCPT), and Letter N-Back (LNB) 
 
 
Aim 5: To examine the influence of pubertal timing in females performance speed on all 
cognitive measures. 
            Hypothesis 5 
           We hypothesized that “typical puberty” and “late puberty” females would be faster 
in completing all cognitive measures than “early puberty” and “typical puberty” females. 
 
Aim 6: To predict performance accuracy scores on cognitive measures from demographic 
variables. 
            Hypothesis 6 

20 
 
            It was hypothesized that performance accuracy scores on all cognitive measures 
could be predicted from demographic information i.e. mothers’ highest education, fathers’ 
highest education, race, ethnicity and time since puberty. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CHAPTER 2: METHODS 
2.1 Sampling Procedure 

21 
 
            The present study obtained data from the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental 
Cohort (PNC) database which contained data for 9,498 participants aged 8-21 from the 
Philadelphia area. The University of Pennsylvania “PENN” and "CHOP" i.e. the 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia conducted this study. Study participants had attended 
the Children’s hospital or its affiliated clinics and had reported interest in participating in 
the study. 
            As part of the study's protocol, necessary approvals (Institutional Review Board) 
were obtained from the University of Pennsylvania and "CHOP", after which individuals 
were mailed letters describing the research. Participants later received telephone calls to 
determine their interest in participating in the study. After eligibility had been established, 
appointments were scheduled for an assessment session at the participant’s home (65.6%), 
at the PENN or CHOP offices (32.7%) or other locations (1.7%). Trained research 
coordinators met with participants and guided them through the study's intent in addition 
to obtaining a hard copy of informed consent. Parental permission in addition to 
participant’s assent was also secured for individuals who were less than 18 years of age. 
Clinical interviews were held in well-structured settings and were conducted to obtain 
information including participants’ medical history. Information was temporarily stored 
on a local copy of the encrypted data collection software on the coordinator’s research 
computer before daily uploading to a central server. 
            The study's protocol also required participants to complete a Computerized 
Neurocognitive battery (CNB) designed by (Gur et al., 2010) in a controlled environment 
with minimal distractors. This took about an hour to be completed. The Computerized 

22 
 
Neurocognitive Battery (CNB) contained 12 measures assessing different cognitive 
domains. The present study utilized a subset of these tests. See Table 1 for more details. 
 
            2.1.1 Consolidation of Data 
            Participants’ performance accuracy and speed on all the neurocognitive measures 
(PLOT, VOLT, PWMT, PVRT, PCET, PCPT, LNB, PEIT, PEDT, and PADT) were 
provided as raw scores and standardized z-scores based on total correct responses. 
Standardized z- scores were categorized into z- scores (calculated based on the whole 
sample), z-scores-age norms (calculated against one year age bins) and z -scores -TD 
norms (calculated based on typical medically and psychologically developing cohorts). 
Standardized scores calculated against one-year age bins were used in lieu of raw scores 
or the other z- scores because the present study was interested in using participants’ 
accuracy scores that were similar to same-aged cohorts in the general population. 
 
            2.1.2 Data Consolidation for Pubertal Timing 
            Data for 4064 female participants aged 10-21 was obtained from the University of 
Pennsylvania and was organized by the researcher. The present study was interested in 
females aged 15-21 years whose reported age at menarche placed them into “early 
puberty," “typical puberty” and “late puberty” groups. From this data, 1763 participants 
indicated age at the time of study participation as outside the stipulated range 15-21, 
therefore, were excluded from the study.  Participants in the study were placed into 3 

23 
 
groups based on pubertal timing defined in the present study as onset of menarche; “early 
puberty” (8 -9 years), “typical puberty” (10-15 years), and “late puberty” (16 years and 
over). Out of the 2301 eligible participants, 60 participants were identified by the 
researcher as “late puberty” females, 104 participants as “early puberty” and 2,137 
participants as “typical puberty” females.  
            As part of the study, the researcher matched participants in the puberty groups on 
age, medical ratings i.e. "ranging from no central nervous system impact to major central 
nervous system impact," psychiatric ratings i.e. ranging from no DSM-IV symptoms 
endorsed to significant DSM-IV symptoms endorsed," participants’ highest education, 
highest parental education (mothers and fathers), race and ethnicity. In the process of 
matching participants, the researcher observed that participants in the “late puberty” 
group were much older in years (18+ years old) than participants in the “early puberty” 
group (15+ years old). Due to this, the researcher selected only 50 participants in the “late 
puberty” group, mean age 18.34 and 56 participants in the “early puberty” group, mean 
age 18.09. In order to select participants for the “typical puberty” group which consisted 
of 56 participants mean age 17.91 that would be similar in age as those in the “early 
puberty” and “late puberty” groups, the researcher went through a rigorous selection 
process. The researcher went through the list of “typical puberty” participants and 
selected participants that met the desired age criteria until all three puberty groups were 
matched on age, medical ratings, psychiatric ratings, highest education and parental 
education. Participants were not able to be matched on race and ethnicity. The final 
sample size consisted of a total of 162 participants broken down into puberty groups as 

24 
 
follows: “early puberty” group (n = 56), “typical puberty” group (n = 56) and “late 
puberty” group (n = 50). See figure 1 for more details.  
 
2.2 Participants 
             One hundred and sixty-two female participants, a subset of participants from the 
Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort database (PNC), were sampled for this study.  
Participants were English-speaking females between the ages of 15 and 21 years (M = 
17.65, SD = 1.83) classified into 3 groups based on pubertal timing defined in the present 
study as age at menarche; “early puberty” (8 -9 years), “typical puberty” (10-15 years), 
and “late puberty” (16 years and over). Participants whose reported age at the time of 
study participation was outside the stipulated range (e.g., before age 15 years) were 
excluded from the study. 
            The present study included 73 Caucasian (45.06%), 74 African American 
(45.67%) and 15 participants belonging to other races (9.26%) whose ages ranged from 
15-21 years.  One hundred and forty-six participants were non-Hispanic (90.12%), and 16 
participants identified themselves as Hispanic/Latino (9.88%).  Participants’ highest 
education level ranged from 8 to 16 years with a mean of 11.57 (SD = 1.29).  Highest 
level of education for both parents was on average 14.11 years (SD = 2.24) for mothers 
and 13.74 (SD = 2.68) for fathers. As previously explained, participants were grouped 
into one of three puberty groups based on reported age at menarche: “early puberty” 
(n=56), “typical puberty” (n=56), and “late puberty” (n=50). Table 2 contains a summary 
of the demographic variables. 

25 
 
2.3 Measures 
            The cognitive measures used in this study were a subset of the CNB, a one-hour 
computerized neurocognitive battery. Demographics and pubertal history data had been 
obtained during the study. Measure descriptions were obtained from the 2012 study 
conducted by Gur and colleagues (Gur et al., 2012). 
 
            2.3.1 Demographic Information 
            Demographic information was gathered for each participant which included 
participants’ name, age, date of birth, gender, race, ethnicity, medication use and whether 
or not English was their primary language. Some information was obtained during the 
interview and some at the time of the CNB administration. Variables of interest to the 
present study were age, gender, race, ethnicity, highest educational level, highest parental 
education (mothers and fathers), age at menarche and “time since puberty” (created by 
the researcher; i.e. age at the time of study participation minus age at menarche). 
 
            2.3.2 Pubertal History 
            Pubertal history using the Tanner Sexual Maturity Scale (Marshall & Tanner, 
1969) was obtained from participants. All components of the original scale were not 
administered. Information gathered included participants’ height, skin changes (acne), 
growth of body and pubic hair, breast growth and age at menarche. The only variable of 
interest to the present study was age at menarche. 

26 
 
            2.3.2 Computerized Neurocognitive Measures 
           "PLOT"- Penn Line Orientation Test (Gur et al., 2010) 
            The PLOT was used to assess participants’ spatial orientation performance; 
administration time, M = 5.2 minutes, SD = 1.3. In this test, participants completed 24 
trials where two lines were shown each at an angle. One red (fixed) and the other blue 
(movable). Participants were instructed to manipulate the blue line clockwise or 
counterclockwise by clicking either one of two buttons to change its angle by 3, 6 or 9 
degrees (based on the item in question). Line length (blue) and location on the screen 
varied in each trial but the red line did not change. Performance accuracy was calculated 
based on the total number of correct trials; consisting of the total number of correctly 
manipulated line lengths, the three-line angles and the four possible positions. The 
median speed i.e. response time for completing all correct trials was also recorded. Total 
number of correct responses and median speed of accurate scores were of interest to the 
researcher. 
 
            "VOLT"- Visual Object Learning Test (Glan et al., 1997; Gur et al., 2010) 
              The VOLT was used to assess participants’ memory and visual object learning 
performance; administration time, M = 2.1 minutes, SD = 0.4. The test was given in two 
parts. In the first section, participants were presented10 three-dimensional Euclidean 
shapes and were told to memorize those shapes. The second section of the test involved 
participants being shown a series of 20 three-dimensional Euclidean shapes one at a time. 
These 20 shapes included the 10 shapes they were asked to memorize mixed with 10 foils. 

27 
 
Participants then had to indicate whether they had seen the shape before by clicking 
“Definitely Yes," “Probably Yes," “Definitely No” and “Probably No." This measure was 
scored based on the number of correct responses; “True positives” and “False positive” 
and incorrect responses “True negatives” and “False negatives." The median speed i.e. 
response time for completing all trials was also recorded. Total number of correct 
responses and median speed of accurate scores were of interest to the researcher. 
 
            "PWMT"- Penn Word Memory Test (Gur et al., 1993; Gur et al., 2010) 
             The PWMT was used to assess participants’ word memory performance; 
administration time, M = 3.3 minutes, SD = 0.4. The test was administered in two 
sections. In the first part, participants were shown 20 words one a time. In the second 
section of the test, 40 words consisting of the first 20 words in addition to 20 new words 
were presented to participants.  Participants were instructed to determine using a 
computer mouse whether they had seen the word earlier. The possible choices were 
“Definitely Yes," “Probably Yes," “Probably No” and “Definitely No." This test was 
scored based on the number of correct responses; “True positives” and “False positive” 
and incorrect responses “True negatives” and “False negatives." The median speed 
(response time) for completing all trials were also recorded. The PWMT has a reliability 
statistic of Cronbach‘s α = .71. Total number of correct responses and median speed of 
accurate scores were of interest to the researcher. 
 
 

28 
 
            "PVRT"- Penn Verbal Reasoning Test (Gur et al., 1982; Gur et al., 2010) 
             The PVRT was used to assess participants’ verbal reasoning performance and as 
a measure of language; administration time, M = 2.7 minutes, SD = 1.0. The PVRT 
consisted of 15 multiple choice verbal analogy problems that were age appropriate. 
Performance accuracy was calculated based on the total number of correct responses. 
Median speed (response time) used in completing correct trials were also recorded. The 
PVRT has a Cronbach‘s alpha of α = .87. Total number of correct responses and median 
speed of accurate scores were of interest to the researcher. 
 
            "PEIT"- Penn Emotion Identification Test (Gur et al., 2002; Gur et al., 2010) 
             The PEIT was used to measure participants’ ability to recognize emotions; 
administration time, M = 2.3 minutes, SD = 0.5. Participants were presented with 40 
pictures of faces consisting of 4 male and 4 female faces showing one of five emotions; 
happiness, sadness, anger, fear and no emotion. Participants were instructed to select a 
word that described the emotion they were looking at in each trial. Final scores were 
calculated based on the total number of “true positives” and “false positives” per each 
emotion totaled from both male and female pictures. The test has a reliability statistic of 
alpha, α = .59. Total number of correct responses and median speed of accurate scores 
were of interest to the researcher. 
 
 

29 
 
            "PEDT"- Penn Emotion Differentiation Test (Silver et al., 2002; Gur et al., 2010) 
             The PEDT was used to assess participants ability to identify the intensity of 
emotion; administration time: M = 3.1 minutes, SD = 0.8. Two pictures of an individual 
conveying the same emotion (sadness, fear, happiness and anger) were shown to 
participants. The faces were either showing equal emotional intensity or varying 
emotional intensity. Participants were shown the faces one at a time and were instructed 
to indicate which of the two the faces displayed a more intense emotion or whether both 
faces had similar emotional intensity. There were 36 trials in this test of which 4 trials 
showed faces with no emotion and the remaining 32 showed emotional disparities with 
increments of 10% to 60%. Performance accuracy was calculated based on the total 
number of correct responses in each emotional trial. The median speed i.e. response time 
for completing all correct trials was also recorded. Total number of correct responses and 
median speed of accurate scores were of interest to the researcher. 
 
            "PADT" Penn Age differentiation Test (Gur et al., 2010) 
             The PADT was used to assess participants' ability to visually discriminate small 
differences between stimuli; administration time: M = 2.6 minutes, SD = 0.8. Participants 
were shown two similar-looking faces and were instructed to select which of the two 
faces looked older, or whether they were of the same age. There were 36 random trials 
consisting of an equal number of male and female faces. Out of the 36 trials, 4 faces were 
of similar age, the remaining 32 differentiated in age ranging from 10%-60%. 
Performance accuracy was calculated based on the number of correct responses. Final 

30 
 
scores were determined based on the total number of correct responses per category. 
Median speed (response time) for completing all correct trials were per category was also 
recorded. Total number of correct responses and median speed of accurate scores were of 
interest to the researcher. 
 
            "PCET"- Penn Conditional Exclusion Test (Kurtz et al., 2004; Gur et al., 2010) 
             The PCET was used to assess participants’ mental flexibility and abstraction 
skills, administration time, M = 4.1 minutes, SD = 2.6. Participants were instructed to 
determine which object out of four objects that looked odd compared with the other three 
objects. Participants had to follow three rules “line thickness, shape and size” before 
deciding on an object; these rules changed once participants successfully completed 10 
trials for each principle separately. There were 48 trials and participants had to correctly 
answer 10 successive trials in each category. Each trial could be answered using one of 
the three rules however; answers could fit more than one rule. Participants had to decide 
without help the most-probable rule to use in each trial. Total scores were calculated 
based on all right and wrong choices in addition to all recurring correct and incorrect 
responses under each rule. Median speed (response time) for completing all correct trials 
were per category was also recorded. Total number of correct responses and median 
speed of accurate scores were of interest to the researcher. 
 
 

31 
 
            "PCPT"-Penn Continuous Performance Test (Kurtz et al., 2001; Gur et al., 2010)  
             The PCPT was used to assess participants’ visual alertness and watchfulness; 
administration time; M = 5.3 minutes, SD = 0.5. Participants were presented with a string 
of lines in an analogue number frame consisting of perpendicular and horizontal red lines. 
Participants were instructed to click a computer key (space bar) any time the lines created 
complete alphabets or digits. This test consisted of two parts each lasting 180 seconds. 
One part had participants searching for lines that formed complete digits and the other 
had participant searching for lines that formed complete alphabets.  Each item was shown 
for 300 milliseconds followed by a page with no item that was shown for 700 
milliseconds adding up to 1 second for reaction time. Practice time for this measure was 
allocated before the actual test. Final scores were calculated based on correct responses 
“True positives” and “False positive” and incorrect responses “True negatives” and 
“False negatives." Median speed (response time) for completing all correct trials were per 
category were also recorded. The PCPT has a high internal consistency of α = .92. Total 
number of correct responses and median speed of accurate scores were of interest to the 
researcher. 
 
            Letter N’ Back (LNB) (Ragland et al., 2002; Gur et al., 2010) 
            The LNB was used to assess participants working memory and attention skills; 
administration time, M = 9.8 minutes, SD = 1.8. Participants were instructed to pay 
attention to alphabets on the screen and to click a computer key (space bar) depending on 
one of three concepts; the 0-back, the 1-back and the 2-back. The alphabets were shown 

32 
 
one at a time. The first concept (the 0 -back) required participants to click the computer 
key whenever an alphabet was presented. The second (the 1-back) required participants 
to click the computer key if the alphabet they were looking at was the same as the 
previous alphabet. The third concept (the 2-back) similar to the first rule but with one 
more distractor required participants to click the computer key if the alphabet they were 
looking at was the same as the alphabet before the previous alphabet they had seen. 
Participants were given 250 milliseconds to respond in each trial. Participants responded 
to two batches of trials in each concept in a pre-determined manner. Final scores were 
calculated separately for the total number of all correct responses and separately for each 
concept. The test has high internal consistency with a Cronbach‘s α = .77. Median speed 
(response time) for completing all correct trials were per category was also recorded. 
Total number of correct responses and median speed of accurate scores were of interest to 
the researcher.

                                                   CHAPTER 3: RESULTS 
3.1. Preliminary Demographic Analyses 
            To confirm the matching procedure and ensure that there were no pre-existing 
differences among the puberty groups that would need to be treated as covariates in 
subsequent analyses, preliminary analyses were conducted on demographic variables. 
One-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs) revealed no significant differences among the 
groups on age F (2, 159) = 1.34, p =.27, participants’ highest education, F (2, 159) = .25, 
p =.78, mother’s highest education, F (2, 153) = .96, p =.39 and father’s highest 
education, F (2, 139) = 1.62, p =.20.  
            Parental education scores were positively skewed with a skewness of (.39) for 
mothers and (.47) for fathers indicating that scores on these variables were not normally 
distributed. Highest parental education for both parents was identified as 12 years i.e. 
completed high school. Majority of mothers 33.0% and the majority of fathers 36.4% had 
attained this level of education. Medical ratings, psychiatric ratings and race were also 
positively skewed with a skewness of (.68), (4.54) and (.51) respectively. This meant that 
the majority of participants were identified as medically healthy 66% and psychiatrically 
healthy 95.7%. In addition, the majority of participants were African American, 45.7% or 
Caucasian 45.1% and only 9.3% of participants belonged to the other races. Participants’ 
ethnicity was also negatively skewed with a skewness of (-2.72). This meant that a great 
percentage of participants identified as non-Hispanics, 90.12% and only 9.88 % identified 
as Hispanics. Data transformations were not conducted to correct for normality 

34 
 
assumption violation because the study’s main analyses (one way- multivariate analyses 
of variance; MANOVAs) were considered robust in handling this assumption violation. 
            Participant groups were not able to be matched on race and ethnicity. A Chi 
Square Test of Independence indicated that there were significant differences among the 
puberty groups on race, 2 (4, N = 162) = 12.29, p =.02 and ethnicity, 2 (2, N = 162) = 
6.27, p = .04. There were more African-Americans in the “early puberty” group (58.9%) 
compared to the “typical puberty” (48.2%) and the “late puberty” (28.0%) groups. The 
majority of Caucasians were in the “late puberty” group (60.0%) compared to the “typical 
puberty” (46.4%) and “early puberty” (30.4%) groups. Very few participants belonged to 
the other race groups; specifically in the “early puberty” group (10.7%), “typical puberty” 
(5.4%), and “late puberty” group (12.0%). The majority of participants identified 
themselves as non-Hispanic (90.1%) and few identified themselves as Hispanics (9.9%). 
A Chi Square Test of Independence however, revealed no significant differences among 
the puberty groups on medical history 2 (2, N = 162) = 2.09, p = .35 and psychiatric 
history 2 (2, N = 162) = 1.96, p = .38. See table 2 for details. 
 
          3.1.1 Race and Ethnicity as Potential Confounds 
          A number of studies suggest that race and ethnicity are associated with differences 
in academic achievement among students (Ainsworth-Darnell & Downey, 1998; Ogbu & 
Simmons, 1998; DuPree, 1993).  Cultural elements inherent in different racial groups like 
family characteristics (Moynihan, Rainwater & Yancey, 1967), socioeconomic status and 
educational level of relatives (DuPree, 1993) are seen as possible barriers to educational 

35 
 
achievement among people belonging to certain races and ethnicities. Minority groups 
like African Americans and Latinos appear to show less interest in pursuing higher 
education compared to other races (Ogbu & Simmons, 1998). Given that the percentages 
of different races and ethnicities were significantly different among the puberty groups as 
explained above, we decided to examine these two variables as covariates in subsequent 
analyses. 
 
 3.2 Study’s Main Analyses 
            One-way multivariate analyses of variance (MANCOVA’s) using performance 
accuracy and speed z- scores were conducted to examine the effects of pubertal timing on 
performance accuracy and completion speed after controlling for race and ethnicity. 
Independence of observations, multivariate normality and linearity assumptions were met. 
However, homogeneity of variances and covariances assumptions were not met. 
 
            3.2.1 Spatial Performance Accuracy Analyses 
            Firstly, we determined to investigate the effects of pubertal timing on participants’ 
spatial performance.  Hypotheses one stated that “late puberty” females would perform 
more accurately on the PLOT and VOLT than “early puberty” and “typical puberty” 
females. A one-way MANCOVA using accuracy z- scores was conducted to examine the 
effects of pubertal timing on scores on the PLOT and VOLT controlling for race and 
ethnicity. Results indicated no significant performance differences among the groups, F 

36 
 
(4,300) = .82, p =.28; Wilk's Λ = .98, partial η2 =.01. Means, standard deviations and 
effect sizes are displayed in Table 3. 
 
            3.2.2 Verbal Performance Accuracy Analyses 
           Secondly, we determined to investigate the effects of pubertal timing on 
participants’ verbal performance. Hypotheses two stated that “early puberty” females 
would perform more accurately on the PWMT and PVRT than “typical puberty” and 
“late puberty” females. A one-way MANCOVA using accuracy z- scores was conducted 
to examine the effects of pubertal timing on scores on the PWMT and the PVRT 
controlling for race and ethnicity. Results indicated no significant performance 
differences among the puberty groups, F (4,312) = .45, p =.78; Wilk's Λ = .99, partial η2 
=.01 on scores of the PWMT and PVRT. Means, standard deviations and effect sizes are 
displayed in Table 3. 
 
            3.2 .3 Emotional Cognition Performance Accuracy Analyses 
           Thirdly, we examined the effects of pubertal timing on participants’ emotional 
cognition performance.  Hypothesis three stated that “early puberty” females would 
perform less accurately on the PEIT, PEDT and the PADT than “typical puberty” and 
“late puberty” females. A one-way MANCOVA using accuracy z- scores was conducted 
to examine the effects of pubertal timing on scores on the PEIT, PEDT and the PADT 
controlling for race and ethnicity. Results indicated no significant performance 

37 
 
differences among the groups, F (6,304) = 1.28, p =.27; Wilk's Λ = .95, partial η2 =.03. 
Means, standard deviations and effect sizes are displayed in Table 3.  
 
            3.2.4 Executive Functioning Performance Accuracy Analyses 
           Fourthly, we investigated the effects of pubertal timing on participants’ executive 
function performance. Hypothesis six stated that “early puberty” females would perform 
less accurately on PCET, PCPT and the LNB than “typical puberty” and “late puberty” 
females. A one-way MANCOVA using accuracy z- scores was conducted to examine the 
effects of pubertal timing on scores on the PCET, PCPT and the LNB controlling for race 
and ethnicity. Results indicated no significant performance differences among the groups, 
F (6,298) = 1.13, p =.35; Wilk's Λ = .96, partial η2 =.02. Means, standard deviations and 
effect sizes are displayed in Table 3. 
 
              3.2.5 Completion Speed Analyses 
             The fifth aim was to examine whether the puberty groups differed on time taken 
to complete each neurocognitive measure. Neurocognitive measures were grouped by 
domain and speed analyses were conducted. We hypothesized that “early puberty” 
females would be much slower in completing the neurocognitive tests compared to 
“typical puberty” and “late puberty female.” A series of one-way MANCOVA’s using 
speed z- scores were conducted to examine the effects of pubertal timing on reaction time 
after controlling for race and ethnicity. In general, results indicated no significant speed 

38 
 
differences among the puberty groups on verbal performance (PWMT-S, PVRT-S), F 
(4,312) = .68, p =.61; Wilk's Λ = 0.99, partial η2 =.01, spatial performance (PLOT-
S,VOLT-S), F (4,300) = 1.67, p =.16; Wilk's Λ = 0.96, partial η2 =.02, executive function 
(PCPT-S,PCET-S,LNB-S), F (6,298) = .77, p =.61; Wilk's Λ = 0.97, partial η2 =.02, and 
emotional cognition (PEDT-S,PEIT-S,PADT-S) F (6,304) = .35, p =.91; Wilk's Λ = 0.99, 
partial η2 =.01. Means, standard deviations and effect sizes are displayed in Table 4. 
 
            3.5.6 Prediction Analyses  
            The sixth aim of this study was to determine whether participants’ performance 
accuracy scores on neurocognitive measures could be predicted from demographic 
information (mothers’ education, fathers’ education, race, ethnicity and time since 
puberty). To achieve this, a series of standard multiple regressions were conducted. 
Independence of observations, model specification, multicollinearity, linearity, residuals 
and outliers assumptions were all met.  
           Overall, demographic information altogether significantly predicted variability in 
performance accuracy on the PLOT, r2 = .18, F (5, 131) = 5.64, p < .001, VOLT, r2 = .08, 
F (5, 136) = 2.28, p = .04, PVRT, r2 = .18, F (5, 136) = 6.14, p < .001, PEIT, r2 = .08, F 
(5, 136) = 2.40, p = .04, and marginally predicted PEDT, r2 = .26, F (5, 136) = 2.03, p 
= .08. However, they did not significantly predict variability in performance accuracy on 
the PADT, r2 = .01, F (5, 133) = .17, p = .97, PWMT, r2 = .03, F (5, 136) = .70, p = .63, 
PCET, r2 = .03, F (5, 135) = .76, p = .58, PCPT, r2 = .03, F (5, 135) = .73, p = .60, and  
LNB, r2 = .26, F (5, 132) = 1.86, p = .11. 

39 
 
           The regression results showed that 18% of the variance in performance accuracy 
on the PLOT, 8% of the variance on the VOLT, 26% of the variance on the PEDT, 18% 
of the variance in the PVRT and 8% of the variance in the PEIT could be explained by 
combining all the demographic variables.          
            Individual demographic variable race was a significant predictor of variability in 
the PLOT, VOLT, PVRT and PEDT, performance accuracy. Similarly, ethnicity 
significantly predicted variability in performance accuracy on the PLOT, VOLT and 
PVRT. Mothers’ highest education also significantly predicted variability in both the 
PLOT and the LNB performance accuracy. Fathers’ highest education predicted 
significant variability in just the PEIT and time since puberty significantly predicted the 
PEIT. See table five for more details.  
 
3.3 Power 
           A power analysis using Cohen’s criteria (Cohen, 1992), indicated that this study 
had sufficient power to detect a medium effect size of d = .15 for a linear multiple 
regression: fixed model, r2 deviation from zero, number of predictors =5, α = .05, power 
= .95. The total sample calculated for this study was n = 138 participants. The final 
sample obtained for the present study was n =162 participants.

CHAPTER 4: DISCUSSION 
            In summary, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between 
pubertal timing in females as measured by age at menarche and performance on 
computerized measures with spatial (PLOT, VOLT), verbal (PWMT, PVRT), emotional 
cognition (PEIT, PEDT, PADT) and executive function components (PCET, PCPT, 
LNB). Findings suggest that demographic variables specifically race; ethnicity and 
maternal education could influence neurocognitive performance in females. However, the 
study failed to reveal a significant influence of pubertal timing on cognitive performance 
accuracy and completion speed in females after controlling for race and ethnicity. 
 
4.1 Review of Results 
            4.1.1. Executive Functioning Performance 
           Based on recent findings that early puberty in females as measured by adrenarche 
may be associated with poor executive functioning performance (Sontag-Padilla et al., 
2002), we hypothesized that “early puberty” females would perform less accurately than 
“typical puberty” and “late puberty” females on all measures containing executive 
functioning components (PCET, PCPT, and LNB). This study was the first to investigate 
pubertal timing as measured by menarche and executive functioning in females.  
           The present study’s results did not replicate Sontag-Padilla and colleagues’ (2002) 
findings since we observed no significant differences among the puberty groups on 
performance accuracy on the LNB, PCET or PCPT. This lack of significant findings on 

41 
 
the LNB, PCET and PCPT suggests that pubertal timing in females probably has no 
significant influence on executive function performance using the present study’s 
neurocognitive measures.    
             Alternatively, we could propose a possible influence of pubertal timing on 
executive functioning performance; however our failure to achieve conventionally 
defined significance levels could be due to the study’s design (quasi- experimental design) 
and methodology which may have been less sensitive in identifying these differences. 
Additionally, an examination of the magnitude of differences among the puberty groups 
indicated effect sizes that were mostly small; with a couple effect sizes within the 
medium range. This suggests that pubertal timing could influence executive function 
performance in females however; the magnitude of effect on executive functioning 
performance accuracy and speed could be overlooked as minute. 
 
            4.1.2 Verbal Performance 
           Although previous studies had shown no relationship between pubertal timing and 
vocabulary and verbal fluency performance among females (Hassler, 1991; Sanders & 
Soares, 1986; Strauss & Kinsbourne, 1981; Waber, 1976 & 1977), we hypothesized that 
“early puberty” females would perform more accurately on the PWMT and PVRT than 
“typical puberty” and “late puberty” females. The study’s hypothesis was not supported. 
Results indicated no significant performance differences among “early puberty," “typical 
puberty” and “late puberty” on the PWMT and PVRT.    

42 
 
           Although the hypothesis was not supported, this was an expected null that was 
congruous with previous research (Hassler, 1991; Sanders & Soares, 1986; Rierdan & 
Koff, 1984; Strauss & Kinsbourne, 1981; Waber, 1976 & 1977). An exploration of effect 
sizes among the puberty groups on verbal performance accuracy and speed showed small 
effect sizes. This finding further suggests that the effects of pubertal timing on verbal 
performance in females are not significant since they could not be picked up by the 
neurocognitive measures used the present study.  
 
            4.1.3 Spatial Performance 
            Given that previous research has documented significant differences among the 
puberty groups on spatial performance (Waber, 1977; Sanders & Soares, 1986; Hassler, 
1990; Wirsen et al., 2000); we hypothesized that “late puberty” females would perform 
more accurately than “early puberty” and “typical puberty” females on measures with 
spatial components i.e. the PLOT and the VOLT.  Our hypothesis of increased 
performance accuracy with late puberty was not supported. However, our findings were 
consistent with other studies that reported no relationship between pubertal timing and 
performance accuracy on spatial tasks (Geary & Gilger, 1989; Gilger & Ho, 1989; 
Newcombe, Dubas & Baenninger, 1989; Rierdan & Koff, 1984; Strauss & Kinsbourne, 
1981). 
           Various reasons could account for why no significant differences among the 
puberty groups were observed on spatial performance. One explanation could be the 
different themes underlying the spatial tests used in the present study (spatial orientation) 

43 
 
and spatial tests used in previous studies (spatial visualization). A number of past studies 
that identified significant differences among the puberty groups on spatial performance, 
utilized spatial tests that include mental rotation items as well as tests that require 
participants to solve complex mazes. For example, the Block Design, subset of the 
WISC-R used in Waber’s 1976 study, the Shepard/Metzler Mental Rotation test and ETS 
Card Rotations test used in Sanders and Soares’s 1986 study, and the Elithorn Perceptual 
Maze Task, (PMT) used in Wirsen Meurling and colleagues’ 2000 study.  
            More so, mental rotation tests may be more sensitive in detecting differences 
among the puberty groups on spatial performance accuracy. The reason could be that 
such tasks usually require participants to mentally manipulate and twist objects in order 
to comprehend what those objects mean so as to determine into which categories those 
objects can be classified (Johnson, 1990).The spatial measures used in the present study, 
however, were primarily assessing spatial orientation and spatial memory and were not 
related to mental manipulation of items or the solving of mazes. Therefore, differences in 
test components or the nature of test questions could have influenced the pattern of 
results observed in the present study. 
            Another plausible explanation to why our findings were inconsistent with 
previous research stems from the racial and ethnic composition of the present study’s 
sample compared to the samples used in previous studies. As stated earlier, the present 
study consisted of 73 Caucasian (45.06%), 74 African Americans (45.67%) and 15 
participants belonging to other races (9.26%). Two of the earlier studies that found 
differences among the puberty groups in addition to reporting racial statistics used mainly 
Caucasian participants (Waber, 1976; Newcombe & Bandura, 1983). Compared to 

44 
 
previous studies, the present study was more diverse; therefore, our inability to reject the 
null hypothesis could be due to the diversity in sample composition. 
           Furthermore, the pattern of means among the puberty groups on spatial 
performance although indicated small differences, however, the magnitude of differences 
(effect sizes) were shown to be mostly small. This suggests that the effects of pubertal 
timing on spatial performance accuracy and completion speed using the present study’s 
spatial measures are small and negligible. 
 
            4.1.4 Emotional Cognition Performance 
           This study investigated the influence of pubertal timing in females on emotional 
cognition using the PEIT, PEDT and the PADT. Since no previous study had examined 
this relationship, we relied on adolescence status (early, typical and late) and emotional 
cognition studies that had observed a relationship between early adolescence and poor 
emotional information skills (Steinberg, 2005). Based on this, we hypothesized that 
“early puberty” females would perform less accurately on all three emotional cognition 
measures than “typical puberty” and “late puberty” females. Our findings did not support 
the hypothesis above. 
             Although no study to date had examined the influence of pubertal timing in 
females on emotional cognition performance, there are several possible explanations for 
why the present study’s hypothesis was not supported. First, we could propose that there 
truly was no effect of pubertal timing on emotional cognition performance using the 
present study’s neurocognitive measures. 

45 
 
             Conversely, we could also assert that pubertal timing in females could influence 
emotional cognition performance however our study’s methodology and design (quasi- 
experimental design) was less sensitive in identifying significant differences among the 
puberty groups. Furthermore, an exploration of effect sizes indicated that there were 
differences among the puberty groups on emotional performance accuracy and 
completion speeds however, the magnitude of those effects were mostly small. This 
further suggests that the effects of pubertal timing on emotional cognition may be small 
and poses no psychosocial threats to individuals in the different puberty groups  
 
            4.1.5 Review of Regression Results 
           Previous studies have documented the influence of demographic variables like 
race, ethnicity and parental education on academic performance, (Ogbu & Simons, 1998, 
Kao & Thompson, 2003; Nelson, 2009). Based on these trends, we hypothesized that 
accuracy scores on neurocognitive measures could be predicted from demographic 
information. A summary of the results indicated that demographic information 
collectively predicted significant amount of variability in the PLOT, VOLT, PVRT, PEIT, 
and PEDT. However, they failed to explain variability in the LNB, PCET, PEPT, PWMT, 
and the PADT. Race and ethnicity made the biggest independent contributions to the 
prediction of performance accuracy in PLOT, VOLT, PVRT, PEDT, and race singularly, 
in the prediction of performance accuracy in the PEIT. Similarly, mothers’ highest 
education significantly predicted variability in both the PLOT and the LNB performance 

46 
 
accuracy, and fathers’ highest education predicted significant variability in the PEIT.  
Time since puberty significantly predicted performance on the PEIT. 
           Individual demographic variable results indicated that race, ethnicity and parental 
education could influence neurocognitive performance in females.  These results are 
similar to previously reported findings (Nelson, 2009; Kao & Thompson, 2003; 
Ainsworth-Darnell & Downey, 1998; Ogbu & Simons, 1998). Ainsworth-Darnell and 
Downey explained that ethnic and racial differences inherent in the general population 
like living conditions, socioeconomic status and societal norms could either facilitate or 
impede skill sets necessary for achievement in children (Ainsworth-Darnell & Downey, 
1998).  
           Kao and Thompson 2003 also noted  that although there was a desire inherent in 
people belonging to certain races (African Americans and Hispanics) to advance 
themselves in education, this passion seemed to remain only at the cognitive level and 
never got achieved, thereby widening the educational gap existing among the races (Kao 
& Thompson, 2003). The explanation for why the education dream was not achieved 
could be due to limited financial resources associated with these races compared to 
Caucasians (Saegert et al., 2007). Therefore, the realization of those goals and dreams 
became impossible (Kao & Thompson, 2003). 
           Other studies suggest that parental education and parental involvement could 
influence students’ academic achievement (Nelson, 2009; Sánchez, Reyes, and Singh 
2006). Nelson (2009) argued that parental education in and of itself did not influence 
students’ academic work, however, the level of parental involvement with their children’s 

47 
 
homework and other school related activities predicted success (Nelson, 2009). Similarly, 
one study noted that parental apathy towards their children’s school-work and anything 
school related contributed to poor academic outcomes in Hispanic children (Sánchez, 
Reyes & Singh 2006). 
           Time since puberty also predicted significant variability in the PEIT. We suggest 
that the relationship between time since puberty and neurocognitive performance could 
be traced to the continual development of the frontal lobes from puberty till the 20’s 
(Casey, Tottenham, Liston, & Durston, 2005; Blakemore &Choudhury, 2006; Sowell et 
al., 2001; Giedd et al., 1999). In the present study, time since puberty was described as 
the number of years that had elapsed since females experienced menarche. Therefore, the 
ability of this variable in explaining variability in a neurocognitive measure is similar to 
findings that the brains’ frontal lobes associated with executive function skills continue to 
mature even after puberty (Sowell et al., 2001; Giedd et al., 1999).  
 
4.2 Limitations 
           Caution should be taken when interpreting this study’s findings due to a number of 
limitations. First, data for this study was sampled from the PNC Database, and the 
researcher could not randomly assign participants to the various puberty groups making 
this a quasi-experiment. The study’s design also prevented the researcher from matching 
the groups on two demographic variables (race and ethnicity). Additionally, this study did 
not control for the use of oral contraception in participants at the time of study 
participation. Oral contraceptives may have altered hormone levels and cognitive 

48 
 
performance of participants at the time of study participation. This could be an 
explanation for why no differences were observed among the puberty groups. 
           Additionally, the method of determining pubertal timing was subjective in nature 
as participants were asked to recall the age at menarche. No information regarding a more 
objective assessment of the age at which participants reached puberty was obtained. 
Therefore, the researcher could not verify whether an individual’s placement into a 
particular puberty group was accurate. 
            Furthermore, two assumptions of the study’s main analyses, homogeneity of 
variances and covariances assumptions were not met. Therefore, the present study’s 
inability to find significant differences among the puberty groups could be due to these 
violations. Lastly, the present study was cross-sectional in nature; therefore, results could 
not establish causality. Hence, we could not determine the actual effects of pubertal 
timing on cognitive performance since participants were not followed and assessed 
longitudinally. 
 
4.3 Directions for Future Research 
            4.3.1 Research Methodology 
           Future research on pubertal timing and cognition should sample participants from 
the general population and not rely on already collected data since this can limit 
researchers in many ways as mentioned above. We also recommend that future research 
conduct longitudinal studies in order to ascertain the actual effects of pubertal timing on 

49 
 
cognitive performance in females. Additionally, we recommend that future research 
control for the use of oral contraception at the time of study participation in order to rule 
out the effects of sex hormones on cognitive performance. Lastly, we suggest that 
researchers use a more objective way of assessing pubertal timing in order to make an 
accurate determination of which puberty groups participant belong. 
 
            4.3.2 Effects of Demographic Variables on Female Cognition 
           From our results, we observed a trend suggesting that demographic variables could 
influence spatial, verbal, emotional and executive function performance in females. 
Effects of race, ethnicity, parental education and time since puberty, on neurocognitive 
performance in females were similar to findings in the literature. Based on this, we 
recommend further research on the effects of these variables on female cognition so as to 
ascertain the influence of these variables on performance. 
 
4.4 Clinical Implications 
            4.4.1 Effects of Pubertal Timing on Cognitive Performance 
           Prior to this study, several studies had reported varying effects of pubertal timing 
in females on cognitive performance. However, none of those studies controlled for race 
and ethnicity. The present study was the first to shed light into pubertal timing in females 
and cognitive performance (spatial, verbal, emotional cognition, and executive function 
domains) while controlling for race and ethnicity. The study’s non-significant results 

50 
 
suggested that pubertal timing may have no effects on cognition or that the effects were 
so negligible that they could not be picked up by the cognitive measures used in the 
present study. 
 
            4.4.2 Contributions to Pubertal Timing and Cognitive Performance Literature 
           Previous studies investigating pubertal timing and cognitive performance focused 
largely on spatial and verbal cognition. The present study contributed to the literature by 
replicating non-significant findings on both spatial and verbal cognition. Additionally, 
this study evaluated the relationship between pubertal timing in females and emotional 
and executive function performance thereby widening the literature. Similarly, the 
present study expanded the research body by investigating the effects of pubertal timing 
on reaction time (completion speed) in females. Lastly, the present study was the first to 
examine the influence of demographic variables in predicting performance accuracy on 
neurocognitive measures in females. These findings suggested that although pubertal 
timing may not significantly influence cognitive performance using the present study’s 
cognitive measures; race, ethnicity, parental education, time since puberty and other 
cognitive measures could.
