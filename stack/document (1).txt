Preface
This book belongs to a series of online books summarizing the recent state Topological Geometro-
dynamics (TGD) and its applications.
TGD can be regarded as a uniﬁed theory of fundamental
interactions but is not the kind of uniﬁed theory as so called GUTs constructed by graduate stu-
dents at seventies and eighties using detailed recipes for how to reduce everything to group theory.
Nowadays this activity has been completely computerized and it probably takes only a few hours to
print out the predictions of this kind of uniﬁed theory as an article in the desired format. TGD is
something diﬀerent and I am not ashamed to confess that I have devoted the last 32 years of my life
to this enterprise and am still unable to write The Rules.
I got the basic idea of Topological Geometrodynamics (TGD) during autumn 1978, perhaps it
was October. What I realized was that the representability of physical space-times as 4-dimensional
surfaces of some higher-dimensional space-time obtained by replacing the points of Minkowski space
with some very small compact internal space could resolve the conceptual diﬃculties of general rela-
tivity related to the deﬁnition of the notion of energy. This belief was too optimistic and only with
the advent of what I call zero energy ontology the understanding of the notion of Poincare invariance
has become satisfactory.
It soon became clear that the approach leads to a generalization of the notion of space-time with
particles being represented by space-time surfaces with ﬁnite size so that TGD could be also seen as
a generalization of the string model. Much later it became clear that this generalization is consistent
with conformal invariance only if space-time is 4-dimensional and the Minkowski space factor of
imbedding space is 4-dimensional.
It took some time to discover that also the geometrization of also gauge interactions and elementary
particle quantum numbers could be possible in this framework: it took two years to ﬁnd the unique
internal space providing this geometrization involving also the realization that family replication
phenomenon for fermions has a natural topological explanation in TGD framework and that the
symmetries of the standard model symmetries are much more profound than pragmatic TOE builders
have believed them to be. If TGD is correct, main stream particle physics chose the wrong track leading
to the recent deep crisis when people decided that quarks and leptons belong to same multiplet of the
gauge group implying instability of proton.
There have been also longstanding problems.
• Gravitational energy is well-deﬁned in cosmological models but is not conserved. Hence the
conservation of the inertial energy does not seem to be consistent with the Equivalence Princi-
ple. Furthermore, the imbeddings of Robertson-Walker cosmologies turned out to be vacuum
extremals with respect to the inertial energy. About 25 years was needed to realize that the sign
of the inertial energy can be also negative and in cosmological scales the density of inertial energy
vanishes: physically acceptable universes are creatable from vacuum. Eventually this led to the
notion of zero energy ontology which deviates dramatically from the standard ontology being
however consistent with the crossing symmetry of quantum ﬁeld theories. In this framework the
quantum numbers are assigned with zero energy states located at the boundaries of so called
causal diamonds deﬁned as intersections of future and past directed light-cones. The notion of
energy-momentum becomes length scale dependent since one has a scale hierarchy for causal
diamonds. This allows to understand the non-conservation of energy as apparent. Equivalence
Principle generalizes and has a formulation in terms of coset representations of Super-Virasoro
algebras providing also a justiﬁcation for p-adic thermodynamics.
• From the beginning it was clear that the theory predicts the presence of long ranged classical
electro-weak and color gauge ﬁelds and that these ﬁelds necessarily accompany classical electro-
magnetic ﬁelds. It took about 26 years to gain the maturity to admit the obvious: these ﬁelds
are classical correlates for long range color and weak interactions assignable to dark matter.
The only possible conclusion is that TGD physics is a fractal consisting of an entire hierarchy
of fractal copies of standard model physics. Also the understanding of electro-weak massivation
and screening of weak charges has been a long standing problem, and 32 years was needed to
discover that what I call weak form of electric-magnetic duality gives a satisfactory solution of
the problem and provides also surprisingly powerful insights to the mathematical structure of
quantum TGD.

iv
I started the serious attempts to construct quantum TGD after my thesis around 1982.
The
original optimistic hope was that path integral formalism or canonical quantization might be enough
to construct the quantum theory but the ﬁrst discovery made already during ﬁrst year of TGD was that
these formalisms might be useless due to the extreme non-linearity and enormous vacuum degeneracy
of the theory. This turned out to be the case.
• It took some years to discover that the only working approach is based on the generalization
of Einstein’s program. Quantum physics involves the geometrization of the inﬁnite-dimensional
”world of classical worlds” (WCW) identiﬁed as 3-dimensional surfaces.
Still few years had
to pass before I understood that general coordinate invariance leads to a more or less unique
solution of the problem and implies that space-time surfaces are analogous to Bohr orbits. Still
a coupled of years and I discovered that quantum states of the Universe can be identiﬁed as
classical spinor ﬁelds in WCW. Only quantum jump remains the genuinely quantal aspect of
quantum physics.
• During these years TGD led to a rather profound generalization of the space-time concept.
Quite general properties of the theory led to the notion of many-sheeted space-time with sheets
representing physical subsystems of various sizes.
At the beginning of 90s I became dimly
aware of the importance of p-adic number ﬁelds and soon ended up with the idea that p-adic
thermodynamics for a conformally invariant system allows to understand elementary particle
massivation with amazingly few input assumptions. The attempts to understand p-adicity from
basic principles led gradually to the vision about physics as a generalized number theory as
an approach complementary to the physics as an inﬁnite-dimensional spinor geometry of WCW
approach. One of its elements was a generalization of the number concept obtained by fusing real
numbers and various p-adic numbers along common rationals. The number theoretical trinity
involves besides p-adic number ﬁelds also quaternions and octonions and the notion of inﬁnite
prime.
• TGD inspired theory of consciousness entered the scheme after 1995 as I started to write a book
about consciousness. Gradually it became diﬃcult to say where physics ends and consciousness
theory begins since consciousness theory could be seen as a generalization of quantum measure-
ment theory by identifying quantum jump as a moment of consciousness and by replacing the
observer with the notion of self identiﬁed as a system which is conscious as long as it can avoid
entanglement with environment. ”Everything is conscious and consciousness can be only lost”
summarizes the basic philosophy neatly. The idea about p-adic physics as physics of cognition
and intentionality emerged also rather naturally and implies perhaps the most dramatic gener-
alization of the space-time concept in which most points of p-adic space-time sheets are inﬁnite
in real sense and the projection to the real imbedding space consists of discrete set of points.
One of the most fascinating outcomes was the observation that the entropy based on p-adic
norm can be negative. This observation led to the vision that life can be regarded as something
in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. Negentropic entanglement has interpretation as
a correlate for various positively colored aspects of conscious experience and means also the
possibility of strongly correlated states stable under state function reduction and diﬀerent from
the conventional bound states and perhaps playing key role in the energy metabolism of living
matter.
• One of the latest threads in the evolution of ideas is only slightly more than six years old.
Learning about the paper of Laurent Nottale about the possibility to identify planetary orbits
as Bohr orbits with a gigantic value of gravitational Planck constant made once again possible to
see the obvious. Dynamical quantized Planck constant is strongly suggested by quantum classical
correspondence and the fact that space-time sheets identiﬁable as quantum coherence regions can
have arbitrarily large sizes. During summer 2010 several new insights about the mathematical
structure and interpretation of TGD emerged. One of these insights was the realization that
the postulated hierarchy of Planck constants might follow from the basic structure of quantum
TGD. The point is that due to the extreme non-linearity of the classical action principle the
correspondence between canonical momentum densities and time derivatives of the imbedding
space coordinates is one-to-many and the natural description of the situation is in terms of local
singular covering spaces of the imbedding space. One could speak about eﬀective value of Planck

v
constant coming as a multiple of its minimal value. The implications of the hierarchy of Planck
constants are extremely far reaching so that the signiﬁcance of the reduction of this hierarchy to
the basic mathematical structure distinguishing between TGD and competing theories cannot
be under-estimated.
From the point of view of particle physics the ultimate goal is of course a practical construction
recipe for the S-matrix of the theory. I have myself regarded this dream as quite too ambitious taking
into account how far reaching re-structuring and generalization of the basic mathematical structure
of quantum physics is required.
It has indeed turned out that the dream about explicit formula
is unrealistic before one has understood what happens in quantum jump. Symmetries and general
physical principles have turned out to be the proper guide line here. To give some impressions about
what is required some highlights are in order.
• With the emergence of zero energy ontology the notion of S-matrix was replaced with M-matrix
which can be interpreted as a complex square root of density matrix representable as a diagonal
and positive square root of density matrix and unitary S-matrix so that quantum theory in zero
energy ontology can be said to deﬁne a square root of thermodynamics at least formally.
• A decisive step was the strengthening of the General Coordinate Invariance to the requirement
that the formulations of the theory in terms of light-like 3-surfaces identiﬁed as 3-surfaces at
which the induced metric of space-time surfaces changes its signature and in terms of space-like
3-surfaces are equivalent. This means eﬀective 2-dimensionality in the sense that partonic 2-
surfaces deﬁned as intersections of these two kinds of surfaces plus 4-D tangent space data at
partonic 2-surfaces code for the physics. Quantum classical correspondence requires the coding
of the quantum numbers characterizing quantum states assigned to the partonic 2-surfaces to
the geometry of space-time surface. This is achieved by adding to the modiﬁed Dirac action a
measurement interaction term assigned with light-like 3-surfaces.
• The replacement of strings with light-like 3-surfaces equivalent to space-like 3-surfaces means
enormous generalization of the super conformal symmetries of string models. A further general-
ization of these symmetries to non-local Yangian symmetries generalizing the recently discovered
Yangian symmetry of N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theories is highly suggestive. Here the
replacement of point like particles with partonic 2-surfaces means the replacement of conformal
symmetry of Minkowski space with inﬁnite-dimensional super-conformal algebras. Yangian sym-
metry provides also a further reﬁnement to the notion of conserved quantum numbers allowing
to deﬁne them for bound states using non-local energy conserved currents.
• A further attractive idea is that quantum TGD reduces to almost topological quantum ﬁeld
theory. This is possible if the K¨ahler action for the preferred extremals deﬁning WCW K¨ahler
function reduces to a 3-D boundary term. This takes place if the conserved currents are so called
Beltrami ﬁelds with the deﬁning property that the coordinates associated with ﬂow lines extend
to single global coordinate variable. This ansatz together with the weak form of electric-magnetic
duality reduces the K¨ahler action to Chern-Simons term with the condition that the 3-surfaces
are extremals of Chern-Simons action subject to the constraint force deﬁned by the weak form
of electric magnetic duality. It is the latter constraint which prevents the trivialization of the
theory to a topological quantum ﬁeld theory. Also the identiﬁcation of the K¨ahler function of
WCW as Dirac determinant ﬁnds support as well as the description of the scattering amplitudes
in terms of braids with interpretation in terms of ﬁnite measurement resolution coded to the
basic structure of the solutions of ﬁeld equations.
• In standard QFT Feynman diagrams provide the description of scattering amplitudes.
The
beauty of Feynman diagrams is that they realize unitarity automatically via the so called
Cutkosky rules. In contrast to Feynman’s original beliefs, Feynman diagrams and virtual parti-
cles are taken only as a convenient mathematical tool in quantum ﬁeld theories. QFT approach
is however plagued by UV and IR divergences and one must keep mind open for the possibility
that a genuine progress might mean opening of the black box of the virtual particle.
In TGD framework this generalization of Feynman diagrams indeed emerges unavoidably. Light-
like 3-surfaces replace the lines of Feynman diagrams and vertices are replaced by 2-D partonic

vi
2-surfaces. Zero energy ontology and the interpretation of parton orbits as light-like ”wormhole
throats” suggests that virtual particle do not diﬀer from on mass shell particles only in that
the four- and three- momenta of wormhole throats fail to be parallel. The two throats of the
wormhole deﬁning virtual particle would contact carry on mass shell quantum numbers but
for virtual particles the four-momenta need not be parallel and can also have opposite signs of
energy. Modiﬁed Dirac equation suggests a number theoretical quantization of the masses of the
virtual particles. The kinematic constraints on the virtual momenta are extremely restrictive
and reduce the dimension of the sub-space of virtual momenta and if massless particles are
not allowed (IR cutoﬀprovided by zero energy ontology naturally), the number of Feynman
diagrams contributing to a particular kind of scattering amplitude is ﬁnite and manifestly UV
and IR ﬁnite and satisﬁes unitarity constraint in terms of Cutkosky rules. What is remarkable
that fermionic propagatos are massless propagators but for on mass shell four-momenta. This
gives a connection with the twistor approach and inspires the generalization of the Yangian
symmetry to inﬁnite-dimensional super-conformal algebras.
What I have said above is strongly biased view about the recent situation in quantum TGD and
I have left all about applications to the introductions of the books whose purpose is to provide a
bird’s eye of view about TGD as it is now. This vision is single man’s view and doomed to contain
unrealistic elements as I know from experience. My dream is that young critical readers could take
this vision seriously enough to try to demonstrate that some of its basic premises are wrong or to
develop an alternative based on these or better premises. I must be however honest and tell that 32
years of TGD is a really vast bundle of thoughts and quite a challenge for anyone who is not able to
cheat himself by taking the attitude of a blind believer or a light-hearted debunker trusting on the
power of easy rhetoric tricks.

Neither TGD nor these books would exist without the help and encouragement of many people.
The friendship with Heikki and Raija Haila and their family have been kept me in contact with the
everyday world and without this friendship I would not have survived through these lonely 32 years
most of which I have remained unemployed as a scientiﬁc dissident. I am happy that my children have
understood my diﬃcult position and like my friends have believed that what I am doing is something
valuable although I have not received any oﬃcial recognition for it.
During last decade Tapio Tammi has helped me quite concretely by providing the necessary com-
puter facilities and being one of the few persons in Finland with whom to discuss about my work. I
have had also stimulating discussions with Samuli Penttinen who has also helped to get through the
economical situations in which there seemed to be no hope. The continual updating of ﬁfteen online
books means quite a heavy bureaucracy at the level of bits and without a systemization one ends up
with endless copying and pasting and internal consistency is soon lost. Pekka Rapinoja has oﬀered his
help in this respect and I am especially grateful for him for my Python skills. Also Matti Vallinkoski
has helped me in computer related problems.
The collaboration with Lian Sidorov was extremely fruitful and she also helped me to survive
economically through the hardest years. The participation to CASYS conferences in Liege has been
an important window to the academic world and I am grateful for Daniel Dubois and Peter Marcer
for making this participation possible. The discussions and collaboration with Eduardo de Luna and
Istvan Dienes stimulated the hope that the communication of new vision might not be a mission
impossible after all. Also blog discussions have been very useful. During these years I have received
innumerable email contacts from people around the world.
In particualr, I am grateful for Mark
McWilliams and Ulla Matfolk for providing links to possibly interesting web sites and articles. These
contacts have helped me to avoid the depressive feeling of being some kind of Don Quixote of Science
and helped me to widen my views: I am grateful for all these people.
In the situation in which the conventional scientiﬁc communication channels are strictly closed
it is important to have some loop hole through which the information about the work done can at

vii
least in principle leak to the publicity through the iron wall of the academic censorship. Without any
exaggeration I can say that without the world wide web I would not have survived as a scientist nor
as individual. Homepage and blog are however not enough since only the formally published result is
a result in recent day science. Publishing is however impossible without a direct support from power
holders- even in archives like arXiv.org.
Situation changed for ﬁve years ago as Andrew Adamatsky proposed the writing of a book about
TGD when I had already got used to the thought that my work would not be published during my life
time. The Prespacetime Journal and two other journals related to quantum biology and consciousness
- all of them founded by Huping Hu - have provided this kind of loop holes. In particular, Dainis
Zeps, Phil Gibbs, and Arkadiusz Jadczyk deserve my gratitude for their kind help in the preparation
of an article series about TGD catalyzing a considerable progress in the understanding of quantum
TGD. Also the viXra archive founded by Phil Gibbs and its predecessor Archive Freedom have been of
great help: Victor Christianto deserves special thanks for doing the hard work needed to run Archive
Freedom. Also the Neuroquantology Journal founded by Sultan Tarlaci deserves a special mention
for its publication policy. And last but not least: there are people who experience as a fascinating
intellectual challenge to spoil the practical working conditions of a person working with something
which might be called uniﬁed theory: I am grateful for the people who have helped me to survive
through the virus attacks, an activity which has taken roughly one month per year during the last
half decade and given a strong hue of grey to my hair.
For a person approaching his sixty year birthday it is somewhat easier to overcome the hard feelings
due to the loss of academic human rights than for an inpatient youngster. Unfortunately the economic
situation has become increasingly diﬃcult during the twenty years after the economic depression in
Finland which in practice meant that Finland ceased to be a constitutional state in the strong sense
of the word. It became possible to depose people like me from the society without fear about public
reactions and the classiﬁcation as dropout became a convenient tool of ridicule to circumvent the
ethical issues. During last few years when the right wing has held the political power this trend has
been steadily strengthening. In this kind of situation the concrete help from individuals has been and
will be of utmost importance. Against this background it becomes obvious that this kind of work is
not possible without the support from outside and I apologize for not being able to mention all the
people who have helped me during these years.

Chapter 1
Introduction
1.1
Basic Ideas of TGD
The basic physical picture behind TGD was formed as a fusion of two rather disparate approaches:
namely TGD is as a Poincare invariant theory of gravitation and TGD as a generalization of the
old-fashioned string model.
1.1.1
Background
T(opological) G(eometro)D(ynamics) is one of the many attempts to ﬁnd a uniﬁed description of basic
interactions. The development of the basic ideas of TGD to a relatively stable form took time of about
half decade [K1]. The great challenge is to construct a mathematical theory around these physically
very attractive ideas and I have devoted the last twenty-three years for the realization of this dream
and this has resulted in seven online books about TGD and eight online books about TGD inspired
theory of consciousness and of quantum biology.
Quantum T(opological) G(eometro)D(ynamics) as a classical spinor geometry for inﬁnite-dimensional
conﬁguration space, p-adic numbers and quantum TGD, and TGD inspired theory of consciousness
and of quantum biology have been for last decade of the second millenium the basic three strongly
interacting threads in the tapestry of quantum TGD.
For few years ago the discussions with Tony Smith initiated a fourth thread which deserves the
name ’TGD as a generalized number theory’. The basic observation was that classical number ﬁelds
might allow a deeper formulation of quantum TGD. The work with Riemann hypothesis made time
ripe for realization that the notion of inﬁnite primes could provide, not only a reformulation, but a
deep generalization of quantum TGD. This led to a thorough and extremely fruitful revision of the
basic views about what the ﬁnal form and physical content of quantum TGD might be. Together with
the vision about the fusion of p-adic and real physics to a larger coherent structure these sub-threads
fused to the ”physics as generalized number theory” th
A further thread emerged from the realization that by quantum classical correspondence TGD
predicts an inﬁnite hierarchy of macroscopic quantum systems with increasing sizes, that it is not at
all clear whether standard quantum mechanics can accommodate this hierarchy, and that a dynam-
ical quantized Planck constant might be necessary and certainly possible in TGD framework. The
identiﬁcation of hierarchy of Planck constants whose values TGD ”predicts” in terms of dark matter
hierarchy would be natural. This also led to a solution of a long standing puzzle: what is the proper
interpretation of the predicted fractal hierarchy of long ranged classical electro-weak and color gauge
ﬁelds. Quantum classical correspondences allows only single answer: there is inﬁnite hierarchy of p-
adically scaled up variants of standard model physics and for each of them also dark hierarchy. Thus
TGD Universe would be fractal in very abstract and deep sense.
Every updating of the books makes me frustrated as I see how badly the structure of the repre-
sentation reﬂects my bird’s eye of view as it is at the moment of updating. At this time I realized
that the chronology based identiﬁcation of the threads is quite natural but not logical and it is much
more logical to see p-adic physics, the ideas related to classical number ﬁelds, and inﬁnite primes
as sub-threads of a thread which might be called ”physics as a generalized number theory”. In the

Chapter 1. Introduction
following I adopt this view. This reduces the number of threads to four! I am not even sure about
the number of threads! Be patient!
TGD forces the generalization of physics to a quantum theory of consciousness, and represent
TGD as a generalized number theory vision leads naturally to the emergence of p-adic physics as
physics of cognitive representations. The seven online books [K88, K67, K54, K48, K68, K77, K76]
about TGD and eight online books about TGD inspired theory of consciousness and of quantum
biology [K81, K9, K60, K7, K30, K38, K42, K75] are warmly recommended to the interested reader.
1.1.2
TGD as a Poincare invariant theory of gravitation
The ﬁrst approach was born as an attempt to construct a Poincare invariant theory of gravitation.
Space-time, rather than being an abstract manifold endowed with a pseudo-Riemannian structure, is
regarded as a surface in the 8-dimensional space H = M 4
×CP2, where M 4 denotes Minkowski space and
CP2 = SU(3)/U(2) is the complex projective space of two complex dimensions [A25, A7, A17, A5].
The identiﬁcation of the space-time as a submanifold [A4, A22] of M 4 × CP2 leads to an ex-
act Poincare invariance and solves the conceptual diﬃculties related to the deﬁnition of the energy-
momentum in General Relativity.
It soon however turned out that submanifold geometry, being considerably richer in structure
than the abstract manifold geometry, leads to a geometrization of all basic interactions. First, the
geometrization of the elementary particle quantum numbers is achieved. The geometry of CP2 explains
electro-weak and color quantum numbers. The diﬀerent H-chiralities of H-spinors correspond to the
conserved baryon and lepton numbers. Secondly, the geometrization of the ﬁeld concept results. The
projections of the CP2 spinor connection, Killing vector ﬁelds of CP2 and of H-metric to four-surface
deﬁne classical electro-weak, color gauge ﬁelds and metric in X4.
1.1.3
TGD as a generalization of the hadronic string model
The second approach was based on the generalization of the mesonic string model describing mesons
as strings with quarks attached to the ends of the string.
In the 3-dimensional generalization 3-
surfaces correspond to free particles and the boundaries of the 3- surface correspond to partons in
the sense that the quantum numbers of the elementary particles reside on the boundaries. Various
boundary topologies (number of handles) correspond to various fermion families so that one obtains
an explanation for the known elementary particle quantum numbers. This approach leads also to a
natural topological description of the particle reactions as topology changes: for instance, two-particle
decay corresponds to a decay of a 3-surface to two disjoint 3-surfaces.
This decay vertex does not however correspond to a direct generalization of trouser vertex of
string models. Indeed, the important diﬀerence between TGD and string models is that the analogs
of string world sheet diagrams do not describe particle decays but the propagation of particles via
diﬀerent routes. Particle reactions are described by generalized Feynman diagrams for which 3-D
light-like surface describing particle propagating join along their ends at vertices. As 4-manifolds the
space-time surfaces are therefore singular like Feynman diagrams as 1-manifolds.
1.1.4
Fusion of the two approaches via a generalization of the space-time
concept
The problem is that the two approaches to TGD seem to be mutually exclusive since the orbit of a
particle like 3-surface deﬁnes 4-dimensional surface, which diﬀers drastically from the topologically
trivial macroscopic space-time of General Relativity. The uniﬁcation of these approaches forces a
considerable generalization of the conventional space-time concept. First, the topologically trivial 3-
space of General Relativity is replaced with a ”topological condensate” containing matter as particle
like 3-surfaces ”glued” to the topologically trivial background 3-space by connected sum operation.
Secondly, the assumption about connectedness of the 3-space is given up. Besides the ”topological
condensate” there could be ”vapor phase” that is a ”gas” of particle like 3-surfaces (counterpart of
the ”baby universies” of GRT) and the nonconservation of energy in GRT corresponds to the transfer
of energy between the topological condensate and vapor phase.
What one obtains is what I have christened as many-sheeted space-time. One particular aspect
is topological ﬁeld quantization meaning that various classical ﬁelds assignable to a physical system

1.2. The threads in the development of quantum TGD

correspond to space-time sheets representing the classical ﬁelds to that particular system. One can
speak of the ﬁeld body of a particular physical system. Field body consists of topological light rays,
and electric and magnetic ﬂux quanta. In Maxwell’s theory system does not possess this kind of
ﬁeld identity.
The notion of magnetic body is one of the key players in TGD inspired theory of
consciousness and quantum biology.
This picture became more detailed with the advent of zero energy ontology (ZEO). The basic notion
of ZEO is causal diamond (CD) identiﬁed as the Cartesian product of CP2 and of the intersection
of future and past directed light-cones and having scale coming as an integer multiple of CP2 size is
fundamental. CDs form a fractal hierarchy and zero energy states decompose to products of positive
and negative energy parts assignable to the opposite boundaries of CD deﬁning the ends of the space-
time surface. The counterpart of zero energy state in positive energy ontology is in terms of initial
and ﬁnal states of a physical event, say particle reaction.
General Coordinate Invariance allows to identify the basic dynamical objects as space-like 3-
surfaces at the ends of space-time surface at boundaries of CD: this means that space-time sur-
face is analogous to Bohr orbit. An alternative identiﬁcation is as light-like 3-surfaces at which the
signature of the induced metric changes from Minkowskian to Euclidian and interpreted as lines of
generalized Feynman diagrams. Also the Euclidian 4-D regions would have similar interpretation. The
requirement that the two interpretations are equivalent, leads to a strong form of General Coordinate
Invariance. The outcome is eﬀective 2-dimensionality stating that the partonic 2-surfaces identiﬁed
as intersections of the space-like ends of space-time surface and light-like wormhole throats are the
fundamental objects. That only eﬀective 2-dimensionality is in question is due to the eﬀects caused by
the failure of strict determinism of K¨ahler action. In ﬁnite length scale resolution these eﬀects can be
neglected below UV cutoﬀand above IR cutoﬀ. One can also speak about strong form of holography.
There is a further generalization of the space-time concept inspired by p-adic physics forcing a
generalization of the number concept through the fusion of real numbers and various p-adic number
ﬁelds. Also the hierarchy of Planck constants forces a generalization of the notion of space-time.
A very concise manner to express how TGD diﬀers from Special and General Relativities could
be following. Relativity Principle (Poincare Invariance), General Coordinate Invariance, and Equiva-
lence Principle remain true. What is new is the notion of sub-manifold geometry: this allows to realize
Poincare Invariance and geometrize gravitation simultaneously. This notion also allows a geometriza-
tion of known fundamental interactions and is an essential element of all applications of TGD ranging
from Planck length to cosmological scales. Sub-manifold geometry is also crucial in the applications
of TGD to biology and consciousness theory.
The worst objection against TGD is the observation that all classical gauge ﬁelds are expressible in
terms of four imbedding space coordinates only- essentially CP2 coordinates. The linear superposition
of classical gauge ﬁelds taking place independently for all gauge ﬁelds is lost.
This would be a
catastrophe without many-sheeted space-time. Instead of gauge ﬁelds, only the eﬀects such as gauge
forces are superposed. Particle topologically condenses to several space-time sheets simultaneously
and experiences the sum of gauge forces. This transforms the weakness to extreme economy: in a
typical uniﬁed theory the number of primary ﬁeld variables is countered in hundreds if not thousands,
now it is just four.
1.2
The threads in the development of quantum TGD
The development of TGD has involved several strongly interacting threads:
physics as inﬁnite-
dimensional geometry; TGD as a generalized number theory, the hierarchy of Planck constants inter-
preted in terms of dark matter hierarchy, and TGD inspired theory of consciousness. In the following
these threads are brieﬂy described.
1.2.1
Quantum TGD as spinor geometry of World of Classical Worlds
A turning point in the attempts to formulate a mathematical theory was reached after seven years
from the birth of TGD. The great insight was ”Do not quantize”. The basic ingredients to the new
approach have served as the basic philosophy for the attempt to construct Quantum TGD since then
and have been the following ones:

4
Chapter 1. Introduction
1. Quantum theory for extended particles is free(!), classical(!)
ﬁeld theory for a generalized
Schr¨odinger amplitude in the conﬁguration space CH consisting of all possible 3-surfaces in
H.
”All possible” means that surfaces with arbitrary many disjoint components and with
arbitrary internal topology and also singular surfaces topologically intermediate between two
diﬀerent manifold topologies are included. Particle reactions are identiﬁed as topology changes
[A15, A27, A28]. For instance, the decay of a 3-surface to two 3-surfaces corresponds to the decay
A →B +C. Classically this corresponds to a path of conﬁguration space leading from 1-particle
sector to 2-particle sector. At quantum level this corresponds to the dispersion of the gener-
alized Schr¨odinger amplitude localized to 1-particle sector to two-particle sector. All coupling
constants should result as predictions of the theory since no nonlinearities are introduced.
2. During years this naive and very rough vision has of course developed a lot and is not anymore
quite equivalent with the original insight. In particular, the space-time correlates of Feynman
graphs have emerged from theory as Euclidian space-time regions and the strong form of General
Coordinate Invariance has led to a rather detailed and in many respects un-expected visions.
This picture forces to give up the idea about smooth space-time surfaces and replace space-
time surface with a generalization of Feynman diagram in which vertices represent the failure of
manifold property. I have also startd introduced the word ”world of classical worlds” (WCW)
instead of rather formal ”conﬁguration space”. I hope that ”WCW” does not induce despair in
the reader having tendency to think about the technicalities involved!
3. WCW is endowed with metric and spinor structure so that one can deﬁne various metric related
diﬀerential operators, say Dirac operator, appearing in the ﬁeld equations of the theory. The
most ambitious dream is that zero energy states correspond to a complete solution basis for the
Dirac operator of WCW so that this classical free ﬁeld theory would dictate M-matrices which
form orthonormal rows of what I call U-matrix. Given M-matrix in turn would decompose to a
product of a hermitian density matrix and unitary S-matrix.
M-matrix would deﬁne time-like entanglement coeﬃcients between positive and negative energy
parts of zero energy states (all net quantum numbers vanish for them) and can be regarded as a
hermitian quare root of density matrix multiplied by a unitary S-matrix. Quantum theory would
be in well-deﬁned sense a square root of thermodynamics. The orthogonality and hermiticity
of the complex square roots of density matrices commuting with S-matrix means that they
span inﬁnite-dimensional Lie algebra acting as symmetries of the S-matrix. Therefore quantum
TGD would reduce to group theory in well-deﬁned sense: its own symmetries would deﬁne the
symmetries of the theory. In fact the Lie algebra of Hermitian M-matrices extends to Kac-
Moody type algebra obtained by multiplying hermitian square roots of density matrices with
powers of the S-matrix. Also the analog of Yangian algebra involving only non-negative powers
of S-matrix is possible.
4. By quantum classical correspondence the construction of WCW spinor structure reduces to the
second quantization of the induced spinor ﬁelds at space-time surface. The basic action is so
called modiﬁed Dirac action in which gamma matrices are replaced with the modiﬁed gamma
matrices deﬁned as contractions of the canonical momentum currents with the imbedding space
gamma matrices. In this manner one achieves super-conformal symmetry and conservation of
fermionic currents among other things and consistent Dirac equation. This modiﬁed gamma
matrices deﬁne as anticommutators eﬀective metric, which might provide geometrization for
some basic observables of condensed matter physics. The conjecture is that Dirac determinant
for the modiﬁed Dirac action gives the exponent of K¨ahler action for a preferred extremal
as vacuum functional so that one might talk about bosonic emergence in accordance with the
prediction that the gauge bosons and graviton are expressible in terms of bound states of fermion
and antifermion.
The evolution of these basic ideas has been rather slow but has gradually led to a rather beautiful
vision. One of the key problems has been the deﬁnition of K¨ahler function. K¨ahler function is K¨ahler
action for a preferred extremal assignable to a given 3-surface but what this preferred extremal is?
The obvious ﬁrst guess was as absolute minimum of K¨ahler action but could not be proven to be right
or wrong. One big step in the progress was boosted by the idea that TGD should reduce to almost
topological QFT in which braids wold replace 3-surfaces in ﬁnite measurement resolution, which could

1.2. The threads in the development of quantum TGD
5
be inherent property of the theory itself and imply discretization at partonic 2-surfaces with discrete
points carrying fermion number.
1. TGD as almost topological QFT vision suggests that K¨ahler action for preferred extremals
reduces to Chern-Simons term assigned with space-like 3-surfaces at the ends of space-time
(recall the notion of causal diamond (CD)) and with the light-like 3-surfaces at which the
signature of the induced metric changes from Minkowskian to Euclidian.
Minkowskian and
Euclidian regions would give at wormhole throats the same contribution apart from coeﬃcients
and in Minkowskian regions the √g4 factor would be imaginary so that one would obtain sum of
real term identiﬁable as K¨ahler function and imaginary term identiﬁable as the ordinary action
giving rise to interference eﬀects and stationary phase approximation central in both classical
and quantum ﬁeld theory. Imaginary contribution - the presence of which I realized only after
33 years of TGD - could also havetopological interpretation as a Morse function. On physical
side the emergence of Euclidian space-time regions is something completely new and leads to a
dramatic modiﬁcation of the ideas about black hole interior.
2. The manner to achieve the reduction to Chern-Simons terms is simple. The vanishing of Coulom-
bic contribution to K¨ahler action is required and is true for all known extremals if one makes a
general ansatz about the form of classical conserved currents. The so called weak form of electric-
magnetic duality deﬁnes a boundary condition reducing the resulting 3-D terms to Chern-Simons
terms. In this manner almost topological QFT results. But only ”almost” since the Lagrange
multiplier term forcing electric-magnetic duality implies that Chern-Simons action for preferred
extremals depends on metric.
3. A further quite recent hypothesis inspired by eﬀective 2-dimensionality is that Chern-Simons
terms reduce to a sum of two 2-dimensional terms. An imaginary term proportional to the total
area of Minkowskian string world sheets and a real tem proportional to the total area of partonic
2-surfaces or equivalently strings world sheets in Euclidian space-time regions. Also the equality
of the total areas of strings world sheets and partonic 2-surfaces is highly suggestive and would
realize a duality between these two kinds of objects. String world sheets indeed emerge naturally
for the proposed ansatz deﬁning preferred extremals. Therefore K¨ahler action would have very
stringy character apart from eﬀects due to the failure of the strict determinism meaning that
radiative corrections break the eﬀective 2-dimensionality.
1.2.2
TGD as a generalized number theory
Quantum T(opological)D(ynamics) as a classical spinor geometry for inﬁnite-dimensional conﬁgu-
ration space, p-adic numbers and quantum TGD, and TGD inspired theory of consciousness, have
been for last ten years the basic three strongly interacting threads in the tapestry of quantum TGD.
The fourth thread deserves the name ’TGD as a generalized number theory’. It involves three sep-
arate threads: the fusion of real and various p-adic physics to a single coherent whole by requiring
number theoretic universality discussed already, the formulation of quantum TGD in terms of hyper-
counterparts of classical number ﬁelds identiﬁed as sub-spaces of complexiﬁed classical number ﬁelds
with Minkowskian signature of the metric deﬁned by the complexiﬁed inner product, and the notion
of inﬁnite prime.
p-Adic TGD and fusion of real and p-adic physics to single coherent whole
The p-adic thread emerged for roughly ten years ago as a dim hunch that p-adic numbers might be
important for TGD. Experimentation with p-adic numbers led to the notion of canonical identiﬁcation
mapping reals to p-adics and vice versa. The breakthrough came with the successful p-adic mass
calculations using p-adic thermodynamics for Super-Virasoro representations with the super-Kac-
Moody algebra associated with a Lie-group containing standard model gauge group. Although the
details of the calculations have varied from year to year, it was clear that p-adic physics reduces not
only the ratio of proton and Planck mass, the great mystery number of physics, but all elementary
particle mass scales, to number theory if one assumes that primes near prime powers of two are in a
physically favored position. Why this is the case, became one of the key puzzless and led to a number

6
Chapter 1. Introduction
of arguments with a common gist: evolution is present already at the elementary particle level and
the primes allowed by the p-adic length scale hypothesis are the ﬁttest ones.
It became very soon clear that p-adic topology is not something emerging in Planck length scale
as often believed, but that there is an inﬁnite hierarchy of p-adic physics characterized by p-adic
length scales varying to even cosmological length scales. The idea about the connection of p-adics
with cognition motivated already the ﬁrst attempts to understand the role of the p-adics and inspired
’Universe as Computer’ vision but time was not ripe to develop this idea to anything concrete (p-adic
numbers are however in a central role in TGD inspired theory of consciousness). It became however
obvious that the p-adic length scale hierarchy somehow corresponds to a hierarchy of intelligences and
that p-adic prime serves as a kind of intelligence quotient. Ironically, the almost obvious idea about
p-adic regions as cognitive regions of space-time providing cognitive representations for real regions
had to wait for almost a decade for the access into my consciousness.
There were many interpretational and technical questions crying for a deﬁnite answer.
1. What is the relationship of p-adic non-determinism to the classical non-determinism of the
basic ﬁeld equations of TGD? Are the p-adic space-time region genuinely p-adic or does p-adic
topology only serve as an eﬀective topology? If p-adic physics is direct image of real physics,
how the mapping relating them is constructed so that it respects various symmetries? Is the
basic physics p-adic or real (also real TGD seems to be free of divergences) or both? If it is both,
how should one glue the physics in diﬀerent number ﬁeld together to get The Physics? Should
one perform p-adicization also at the level of the conﬁguration space of 3-surfaces? Certainly
the p-adicization at the level of super-conformal representation is necessary for the p-adic mass
calculations.
2. Perhaps the most basic and most irritating technical problem was how to precisely deﬁne p-adic
deﬁnite integral which is a crucial element of any variational principle based formulation of the
ﬁeld equations. Here the frustration was not due to the lack of solution but due to the too large
number of solutions to the problem, a clear symptom for the sad fact that clever inventions
rather than real discoveries might be in question. Quite recently I however learned that the
problem of making sense about p-adic integration has been for decades central problem in the
frontier of mathematics and a lot of profound work has been done along same intuitive lines
as I have proceeded in TGD framework. The basic idea is certainly the notion of algebraic
continuation from the world of rationals belonging to the intersection of real world and various
p-adic worlds.
Despite these frustrating uncertainties, the number of the applications of the poorly deﬁned p-adic
physics growed steadily and the applications turned out to be relatively stable so that it was clear
that the solution to these problems must exist. It became only gradually clear that the solution of
the problems might require going down to a deeper level than that represented by reals and p-adics.
The key challenge is to fuse various p-adic physics and real physics to single larger structures.
This has inspired a proposal for a generalization of the notion of number ﬁeld by fusing real numbers
and various p-adic number ﬁelds and their extensions along rationals and possible common algebraic
numbers. This leads to a generalization of the notions of imbedding space and space-time concept and
one can speak about real and p-adic space-time sheets. The quantum dynamics should be such that
it allows quantum transitions transforming space-time sheets belonging to diﬀerent number ﬁelds to
each other. The space-time sheets in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds are of special interest
and the hypothesis is that living matter resides in this intersection. This leads to surprisingly detailed
predictions and far reaching conjectures. For instance, the number theoretic generalization of entropy
concept allows negentropic entanglement central for the applications to living matter.
The basic principle is number theoretic universality stating roughly that the physics in various
number ﬁelds can be obtained as completion of rational number based physics to various number
ﬁelds. Rational number based physics would in turn describe physics in ﬁnite measurement resolution
and cognitive resolution. The notion of ﬁnite measurement resolution has become one of the basic
principles of quantum TGD and leads to the notions of braids as representatives of 3-surfaces and
inclusions of hyper-ﬁnite factors as a representation for ﬁnite measurement resolution.

1.2. The threads in the development of quantum TGD

The role of classical number ﬁelds
The vision about the physical role of the classical number ﬁelds relies on the notion of number theoretic
compactiﬁction stating that space-time surfaces can be regarded as surfaces of either M 8 or M 4×CP2.
As surfaces of M 8 identiﬁable as space of hyper-octonions they are hyper-quaternionic or co-hyper-
quaternionic- and thus maximally associative or co-associative. This means that their tangent space
is either hyper-quaternionic plane of M 8 or an orthogonal complement of such a plane. These surface
can be mapped in natural manner to surfaces in M 4×CP2 [K80] provided one can assign to each point
of tangent space a hyper-complex plane M 2(x) ⊂M 4. One can also speak about M 8 −H duality.
This vision has very strong predictive power.
It predicts that the extremals of K¨ahler action
correspond to either hyper-quaternionic or co-hyper-quaternionic surfaces such that one can assign
to tangent space at each point of space-time surface a hyper-complex plane M 2(x) ⊂M 4.
As a
consequence, the M 4 projection of space-time surface at each point contains M 2(x) and its orthogonal
complement. These distributions are integrable implying that space-time surface allows dual slicings
deﬁned by string world sheets Y 2 and partonic 2-surfaces X2. The existence of this kind of slicing
was earlier deduced from the study of extremals of K¨ahler action and christened as Hamilton-Jacobi
structure. The physical interpretation of M 2(x) is as the space of non-physical polarizations and the
plane of local 4-momentum.
One can fairly say, that number theoretical compactiﬁcation is responsible for most of the under-
standing of quantum TGD that has emerged during last years. This includes the realization of Equiv-
alence Principle at space-time level, dual formulations of TGD as Minkowskian and Euclidian string
model type theories, the precise identiﬁcation of preferred extremals of K¨ahler action as extremals
for which second variation vanishes (at least for deformations representing dynamical symmetries)
and thus providing space-time correlate for quantum criticality, the notion of number theoretic braid
implied by the basic dynamics of K¨ahler action and crucial for precise construction of quantum TGD
as almost-topological QFT, the construction of conﬁguration space metric and spinor structure in
terms of second quantized induced spinor ﬁelds with modiﬁed Dirac action deﬁned by K¨ahler action
realizing automatically the notion of ﬁnite measurement resolution and a connection with inclusions
of hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 about which Cliﬀord algebra of conﬁguration space represents an
example.
The two most important number theoretic conjectures relate to the preferred extremals of K¨ahler
action. The general idea is that classical dynamics for the preferred extremals of K¨ahler action should
reduce to number theory: space-time surfaces should be either associative or co-associative in some
sense.
1. The ﬁrst meaning for associativity (co-associativity) would be that tangent (normal) spaces of
space-time surfaces are quaternionic in some sense and thus associative. This can be formu-
lated in terms of octonionic representation of the imbedding space gamma matrices possible in
dimension D = 8 and states that induced gamma matrices generate quaternionic sub-algebra at
each space-time point. It seems that induced rather than modiﬁed gamma matrices must be in
question.
2. Second meaning for associative (co-associativity) would be following. In the case of complex
numbers the vanishing of the real part of real-analytic function deﬁnes a 1-D curve. In oct-
nionic case one can decompose octonion to sum of quaternion and quaternion multiplied by an
octonionic imaginary unit. Quaternionicity could mean that space-time surfaces correspond to
the vanishing of the imaginary part of the octonion real-analytic function. Co-quaternionicity
would be deﬁned in an obvious manner. Octonionic real analytic functions form a function ﬁeld
closed also with respect to the composition of functions. Space-time surfaces would form the
analog of function ﬁeld with the composition of functions with all operations realized as algebraic
operations for space-time surfaces. Co-associaty could be perhaps seen as an additional feature
making the algebra in question also co-algebra.
3. The third conjecture is that these conjectures are equivalent.
Inﬁnite primes
The discovery of the hierarchy of inﬁnite primes and their correspondence with a hierarchy deﬁned by a
repeatedly second quantized arithmetic quantum ﬁeld theory gave a further boost for the speculations

8
Chapter 1. Introduction
about TGD as a generalized number theory. The work with Riemann hypothesis led to further ideas.
After the realization that inﬁnite primes can be mapped to polynomials representable as surfaces
geometrically, it was clear how TGD might be formulated as a generalized number theory with inﬁnite
primes forming the bridge between classical and quantum such that real numbers, p-adic numbers, and
various generalizations of p-adics emerge dynamically from algebraic physics as various completions of
the algebraic extensions of rational (hyper-)quaternions and (hyper-)octonions. Complete algebraic,
topological and dimensional democracy would characterize the theory.
What is especially satisfying is that p-adic and real regions of the space-time surface could emerge
automatically as solutions of the ﬁeld equations. In the space-time regions where the solutions of
ﬁeld equations give rise to in-admissible complex values of the imbedding space coordinates, p-adic
solution can exist for some values of the p-adic prime. The characteristic non-determinism of the p-
adic diﬀerential equations suggests strongly that p-adic regions correspond to ’mind stuﬀ’, the regions
of space-time where cognitive representations reside. This interpretation implies that p-adic physics
is physics of cognition.
Since Nature is probably an extremely brilliant simulator of Nature, the
natural idea is to study the p-adic physics of the cognitive representations to derive information about
the real physics. This view encouraged by TGD inspired theory of consciousness clariﬁes diﬃcult
interpretational issues and provides a clear interpretation for the predictions of p-adic physics.
1.2.3
Hierarchy of Planck constants and dark matter hierarchy
By quantum classical correspondence space-time sheets can be identiﬁed as quantum coherence regions.
Hence the fact that they have all possible size scales more or less unavoidably implies that Planck
constant must be quantized and have arbitrarily large values. If one accepts this then also the idea
about dark matter as a macroscopic quantum phase characterized by an arbitrarily large value of
Planck constant emerges naturally as does also the interpretation for the long ranged classical electro-
weak and color ﬁelds predicted by TGD. Rather seldom the evolution of ideas follows simple linear
logic, and this was the case also now. In any case, this vision represents the ﬁfth, relatively new thread
in the evolution of TGD and the ideas involved are still evolving.
Dark matter as large ℏphase
D. Da Rocha and Laurent Nottale [E3] have proposed that Schr¨odinger equation with Planck constant
ℏreplaced with what might be called gravitational Planck constant ℏgr = GmM
v0
(ℏ= c = 1). v0 is
a velocity parameter having the value v0 = 144.7 ± .7 km/s giving v0/c = 4.6 × 10−4. This is rather
near to the peak orbital velocity of stars in galactic halos. Also subharmonics and harmonics of v0
seem to appear. The support for the hypothesis coming from empirical data is impressive.
Nottale and Da Rocha believe that their Schr¨odinger equation results from a fractal hydrodynamics.
Many-sheeted space-time however suggests astrophysical systems are not only quantum systems at
larger space-time sheets but correspond to a gigantic value of gravitational Planck constant. The
gravitational (ordinary) Schr¨odinger equation would provide a solution of the black hole collapse (IR
catastrophe) problem encountered at the classical level. The resolution of the problem inspired by
TGD inspired theory of living matter is that it is the dark matter at larger space-time sheets which
is quantum coherent in the required time scale [K73] .
TGD predicts correctly the value of the parameter v0 assuming that cosmic strings and their decay
remnants are responsible for the dark matter. The harmonics of v0 can be understood as corresponding
to perturbations replacing cosmic strings with their n-branched coverings so that tension becomes
n2-fold: much like the replacement of a closed orbit with an orbit closing only after n turns. 1/n-
sub-harmonic would result when a magnetic ﬂux tube split into n disjoint magnetic ﬂux tubes. Also
a model for the formation of planetary system as a condensation of ordinary matter around quantum
coherent dark matter emerges [K73] .
The values of Planck constants postulated by Nottale are gigantic and it is natural to assign them
to the space-time sheets mediating gravitational interaction and identiﬁable as magnetic ﬂux tubes
(quanta). The magnetic energy of these ﬂux quanta would correspond to dark energy and magnetic
tension would give rise to negative ”pressure” forcing accelerate cosmological expansion. This leads
to a rather detailed vision about the evolution of stars and galaxies identiﬁed as bubbles of ordinary
and dark matter inside magnetic ﬂux tubes identiﬁable as dark energy.

Hierarchy of Planck constants from the anomalies of neuroscience biology
The quantal eﬀects of ELF em ﬁelds on vertebrate brain have been known since seventies. ELF em
ﬁelds at frequencies identiﬁable as cyclotron frequencies in magnetic ﬁeld whose intensity is about 2/5
times that of Earth for biologically important ions have physiological eﬀects and aﬀect also behavior.
What is intriguing that the eﬀects are found only in vertebrates (to my best knowledge). The energies
for the photons of ELF em ﬁelds are extremely low - about 10−10 times lower than thermal energy
at physiological temperatures- so that quantal eﬀects are impossible in the framework of standard
quantum theory. The values of Planck constant would be in these situations large but not gigantic.
This inspired the hypothesis that these photons correspond to so large value of Planck constant
that the energy of photons is above the thermal energy. The proposed interpretation was as dark
photons and the general hypothesis was that dark matter corresponds to ordinary matter with non-
standard value of Planck constant. If only particles with the same value of Planck constant can appear
in the same vertex of Feynman diagram, the phases with diﬀerent value of Planck constant are dark
relative to each other. The phase transitions changing Planck constant can however make possible
interactions between phases with diﬀerent Planck constant but these interactions do not manifest
themselves in particle physics. Also the interactions mediated by classical ﬁelds should be possible.
Dark matter would not be so dark as we have used to believe.
Also the anomalies of biology support the view that dark matter might be a key player in living
matter.
Does the hierarchy of Planck constants reduce to the vacuum degeneracy of K¨ahler
action?
This starting point led gradually to the recent picture in which the hierarchy of Planck constants
is postulated to come as integer multiples of the standard value of Planck constant. Given integer
multiple ℏ= nℏ0 of the ordinary Planck constant ℏ0 is assigned with a multiple singular covering
of the imbedding space [K24]. One ends up to an identiﬁcation of dark matter as phases with non-
standard value of Planck constant having geometric interpretation in terms of these coverings providing
generalized imbedding space with a book like structure with pages labelled by Planck constants or
integers characterizing Planck constant. The phase transitions changing the value of Planck constant
would correspond to leakage between diﬀerent sectors of the extended imbedding space. The question
is whether these coverings must be postulated separately or whether they are only a convenient
auxiliary tool.
The simplest option is that the hierarchy of coverings of imbedding space is only eﬀective. Many-
sheeted coverings of the imbedding space indeed emerge naturally in TGD framework. The huge
vacuum degeneracy of K¨ahler action implies that the relationship between gradients of the imbedding
space coordinates and canonical momentum currents is many-to-one: this was the very fact forcing to
give up all the standard quantization recipes and leading to the idea about physics as geometry of the
”world of classical worlds”. If one allows space-time surfaces for which all sheets corresponding to the
same values of the canonical momentum currents are present, one obtains eﬀectively many-sheeted
covering of the imbedding space and the contributions from sheets to the K¨ahler action are identical.
If all sheets are treated eﬀectively as one and the same sheet, the value of Planck constant is an integer
multiple of the ordinary one. A natural boundary condition would be that at the ends of space-time
at future and past boundaries of causal diamond containing the space-time surface, various branches
co-incide. This would raise the ends of space-time surface in special physical role.
Dark matter as a source of long ranged weak and color ﬁelds
Long ranged classical electro-weak and color gauge ﬁelds are unavoidable in TGD framework. The
smallness of the parity breaking eﬀects in hadronic, nuclear, and atomic length scales does not however
seem to allow long ranged electro-weak gauge ﬁelds. The problem disappears if long range classical
electro-weak gauge ﬁelds are identiﬁed as space-time correlates for massless gauge ﬁelds created by
dark matter.
Also scaled up variants of ordinary electro-weak particle spectra are possible.
The
identiﬁcation explains chiral selection in living matter and unbroken U(2)ew invariance and free color
in bio length scales become characteristics of living matter and of bio-chemistry and bio-nuclear
physics. A possible solution of the matter antimatter asymmetry is based on the identiﬁcation of also
antimatter as dark matter.

TGD as a generalization of physics to a theory consciousness
General coordinate invariance forces the identiﬁcation of quantum jump as quantum jump between
entire deterministic quantum histories rather than time=constant snapshots of single history. The
new view about quantum jump forces a generalization of quantum measurement theory such that
observer becomes part of the physical system. Thus a general theory of consciousness is unavoidable
outcome. This theory is developed in detail in the books [K81, K9, K60, K7, K30, K38, K42, K75] .
Quantum jump as a moment of consciousness
The identiﬁcation of quantum jump between deterministic quantum histories (conﬁguration space
spinor ﬁelds) as a moment of consciousness deﬁnes microscopic theory of consciousness. Quantum
jump involves the steps
Ψi →UΨi →Ψf ,
where U is informational ”time development” operator, which is unitary like the S-matrix charac-
terizing the unitary time evolution of quantum mechanics. U is however only formally analogous to
Schr¨odinger time evolution of inﬁnite duration although there is no real time evolution involved. It is
not however clear whether one should regard U-matrix and S-matrix as two diﬀerent things or not: U-
matrix is a completely universal object characterizing the dynamics of evolution by self-organization
whereas S-matrix is a highly context dependent concept in wave mechanics and in quantum ﬁeld
theories where it at least formally represents unitary time translation operator at the limit of an in-
ﬁnitely long interaction time. The S-matrix understood in the spirit of superstring models is however
something very diﬀerent and could correspond to U-matrix.
The requirement that quantum jump corresponds to a measurement in the sense of quantum ﬁeld
theories implies that each quantum jump involves localization in zero modes which parameterize also
the possible choices of the quantization axes. Thus the selection of the quantization axes performed
by the Cartesian outsider becomes now a part of quantum theory. Together these requirements imply
that the ﬁnal states of quantum jump correspond to quantum superpositions of space-time surfaces
which are macroscopically equivalent. Hence the world of conscious experience looks classical. At
least formally quantum jump can be interpreted also as a quantum computation in which matrix U
represents unitary quantum computation which is however not identiﬁable as unitary translation in
time direction and cannot be ’engineered’.
Can one say anything about the unitary process? Zero energy states correspond in positive energy
ontology to physical events and break time reversal invariance.
This because either the positive
or negative energy part of the state is prepared whereas the second end of CD corresponds to a
superposition of (negative/positive energy) states with varying particle numbers and single particle
quantum numbers just as in ordinary particle physics experiment.
State function reduction must
change the roles of the ends of CDs. Therefore U-matrix should correspond to the unitary matrix
relating zero energy state basis prepared at diﬀerent ends of CD and state function reduction would
be equivalent with state preparation.
The basic objection is that the arrow of geometric time alternates at imbedding space level but
we know that arrow of time is universal. What one can say about the arrow of time at space-time
level? Quantum classical correspondence requires that quantum mechanical irreversibility corresponds
to irreversibility at space-time level. If the observer is analogous to an inhabitant of Flatland gaining
information only about space-time surface, he or she is not able to discover that the arrow of time
alternates at the level of imbedding space.
The inhabitant of a folded bath towel is not able to
observer the folding of the towel! Only by observing systems for which the imbedding space arrow of
time is opposite, observer can discover the alternation. Living systems indeed behave as if they would
contain space-time sheets with opposite arrow of geometric time (self-organization). Phase conjugate
light beam is second example of this.
The notion of self
The concept of self is absolutely essential for the understanding of the macroscopic and macro-temporal
aspects of consciousness. Self corresponds to a subsystem able to remain un-entangled under the
sequential informational ’time evolutions’ U. Exactly vanishing entanglement is practically impossible

1.2. The threads in the development of quantum TGD
11
in ordinary quantum mechanics and it might be that ’vanishing entanglement’ in the condition for
self-property should be replaced with ’subcritical entanglement’. On the other hand, if space-time
decomposes into p-adic and real regions, and if entanglement between regions representing physics in
diﬀerent number ﬁelds vanishes, space-time indeed decomposes into selves in a natural manner.
It is assumed that the experiences of the self after the last ’wake-up’ sum up to single average
experience. This means that subjective memory is identiﬁable as conscious, immediate short term
memory.
Selves form an inﬁnite hierarchy with the entire Universe at the top.
Self can be also
interpreted as mental images: our mental images are selves having mental images and also we represent
mental images of a higher level self. A natural hypothesis is that self S experiences the experiences
of its subselves as kind of abstracted experience: the experiences of subselves Si are not experienced
as such but represent kind of averages ⟨Sij⟩of sub-subselves Sij. Entanglement between selves, most
naturally realized by the formation of join along boundaries bonds between cognitive or material space-
time sheets, provides a possible a mechanism for the fusion of selves to larger selves (for instance, the
fusion of the mental images representing separate right and left visual ﬁelds to single visual ﬁeld) and
forms wholes from parts at the level of mental images.
An attractive possibility suggested by zero energy ontology is that the notions of self and quantum
jump reduce to each other and that a fractal hierarchy of quantum jumps within quantum jumps
is enough. CDs would serve as imbedding space correlates of selves and quantum jumps would be
followed by cascades of state function reductions beginning from given CD and proceeding downwards
to the smaller scales (smaller CDs). State function reduction cascades could also take place in parallel
branches of the quantum state. One ends up with concrete ideas about how the arrow of geometric
time is induced from that of subjective time deﬁned by the experiences induced by the sequences
of quantum jumps for sub-selves of self. One ends also ends up with concrete ideas about how the
localization of the contents of sensory experience and cognition to the upper boundaries of CD could
take place.
Relationship to quantum measurement theory
The third basic element relates TGD inspired theory of consciousness to quantum measurement theory.
The assumption that localization occurs in zero modes in each quantum jump implies that the world
of conscious experience looks classical. It also implies the state function reduction of the standard
quantum measurement theory as the following arguments demonstrate (it took incredibly long time
to realize this almost obvious fact!).
1. The standard quantum measurement theory a la von Neumann involves the interaction of brain
with the measurement apparatus. If this interaction corresponds to entanglement between mi-
croscopic degrees of freedom m with the macroscopic eﬀectively classical degrees of freedom M
characterizing the reading of the measurement apparatus coded to brain state, then the reduc-
tion of this entanglement in quantum jump reproduces standard quantum measurement theory
provide the unitary time evolution operator U acts as ﬂow in zero mode degrees of freedom and
correlates completely some orthonormal basis of conﬁguration space spinor ﬁelds in non-zero
modes with the values of the zero modes. The ﬂow property guarantees that the localization is
consistent with unitarity: it also means 1-1 mapping of quantum state basis to classical variables
(say, spin direction of the electron to its orbit in the external magnetic ﬁeld).
2. Since zero modes represent classical information about the geometry of space-time surface
(shape, size, classical K¨ahler ﬁeld,...), they have interpretation as eﬀectively classical degrees
of freedom and are the TGD counterpart of the degrees of freedom M representing the reading
of the measurement apparatus. The entanglement between quantum ﬂuctuating non-zero modes
and zero modes is the TGD counterpart for the m−M entanglement. Therefore the localization
in zero modes is equivalent with a quantum jump leading to a ﬁnal state where the measurement
apparatus gives a deﬁnite reading.
This simple prediction is of utmost theoretical importance since the black box of the quantum
measurement theory is reduced to a fundamental quantum theory. This reduction is implied by the
replacement of the notion of a point like particle with particle as a 3-surface.
Also the inﬁnite-
dimensionality of the zero mode sector of the conﬁguration space of 3-surfaces is absolutely essential.
Therefore the reduction is a triumph for quantum TGD and favors TGD against string models.

12
Chapter 1. Introduction
Standard quantum measurement theory involves also the notion of state preparation which reduces
to the notion of self measurement. Each localization in zero modes is followed by a cascade of self
measurements leading to a product state. This process is obviously equivalent with the state prepa-
ration process. Self measurement is governed by the so called Negentropy Maximization Principle
(NMP) stating that the information content of conscious experience is maximized. In the self mea-
surement the density matrix of some subsystem of a given self localized in zero modes (after ordinary
quantum measurement) is measured. The self measurement takes place for that subsystem of self for
which the reduction of the entanglement entropy is maximal in the measurement. In p-adic context
NMP can be regarded as the variational principle deﬁning the dynamics of cognition. In real context
self measurement could be seen as a repair mechanism allowing the system to ﬁght against quantum
thermalization by reducing the entanglement for the subsystem for which it is largest (ﬁll the largest
hole ﬁrst in a leaking boat).
Selves self-organize
The fourth basic element is quantum theory of self-organization based on the identiﬁcation of quantum
jump as the basic step of self-organization [K69] . Quantum entanglement gives rise to the generation
of long range order and the emergence of longer p-adic length scales corresponds to the emergence of
larger and larger coherent dynamical units and generation of a slaving hierarchy. Energy (and quantum
entanglement) feed implying entropy feed is a necessary prerequisite for quantum self-organization.
Zero modes represent fundamental order parameters and localization in zero modes implies that the
sequence of quantum jumps can be regarded as hopping in the zero modes so that Haken’s classical
theory of self organization applies almost as such. Spin glass analogy is a further important element:
self-organization of self leads to some characteristic pattern selected by dissipation as some valley of
the ”energy” landscape.
Dissipation can be regarded as the ultimate Darwinian selector of both memes and genes. The
mathematically ugly irreversible dissipative dynamics obtained by adding phenomenological dissipa-
tion terms to the reversible fundamental dynamical equations derivable from an action principle can be
understood as a phenomenological description replacing in a well deﬁned sense the series of reversible
quantum histories with its envelope.
Classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action
The ﬁfth basic element are the concepts of association sequence and cognitive space-time sheet. The
huge vacuum degeneracy of the K¨ahler action suggests strongly that the absolute minimum space-time
is not always unique. For instance, a sequence of bifurcations can occur so that a given space-time
branch can be ﬁxed only by selecting a ﬁnite number of 3-surfaces with time like(!) separations on the
orbit of 3-surface. Quantum classical correspondence suggest an alternative formulation. Space-time
surface decomposes into maximal deterministic regions and their temporal sequences have interpre-
tation a space-time correlate for a sequence of quantum states deﬁned by the initial (or ﬁnal) states
of quantum jumps. This is consistent with the fact that the variational principle selects preferred
extremals of K¨ahler action as generalized Bohr orbits.
In the case that non-determinism is located to a ﬁnite time interval and is microscopic, this sequence
of 3-surfaces has interpretation as a simulation of a classical history, a geometric correlate for contents
of consciousness. When non-determinism has long lasting and macroscopic eﬀect one can identify it as
volitional non-determinism associated with our choices. Association sequences relate closely with the
cognitive space-time sheets deﬁned as space-time sheets having ﬁnite time duration and psychological
time can be identiﬁed as a temporal center of mass coordinate of the cognitive space-time sheet. The
gradual drift of the cognitive space-time sheets to the direction of future force by the geometry of the
future light cone explains the arrow of psychological time.
p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intentionality
The sixth basic element adds a physical theory of cognition to this vision. TGD space-time decomposes
into regions obeying real and p-adic topologies labelled by primes p = 2, 3, 5, .... p-Adic regions obey
the same ﬁeld equations as the real regions but are characterized by p-adic non-determinism since
the functions having vanishing p-adic derivative are pseudo constants which are piecewise constant
functions. Pseudo constants depend on a ﬁnite number of positive pinary digits of arguments just like

1.2. The threads in the development of quantum TGD
13
numerical predictions of any theory always involve decimal cutoﬀ. This means that p-adic space-time
regions are obtained by gluing together regions for which integration constants are genuine constants.
The natural interpretation of the p-adic regions is as cognitive representations of real physics. The
freedom of imagination is due to the p-adic non-determinism. p-Adic regions perform mimicry and
make possible for the Universe to form cognitive representations about itself. p-Adic physics space-
time sheets serve also as correlates for intentional action.
A more more precise formulation of this vision requires a generalization of the number concept
obtained by fusing reals and p-adic number ﬁelds along common rationals (in the case of algebraic
extensions among common algebraic numbers). This picture is discussed in [K79] . The application
this notion at the level of the imbedding space implies that imbedding space has a book like structure
with various variants of the imbedding space glued together along common rationals (algebraics). The
implication is that genuinely p-adic numbers (non-rationals) are strictly inﬁnite as real numbers so
that most points of p-adic space-time sheets are at real inﬁnity, outside the cosmos, and that the
projection to the real imbedding space is discrete set of rationals (algebraics). Hence cognition and
intentionality are almost completely outside the real cosmos and touch it at a discrete set of points
only.
This view implies also that purely local p-adic physics codes for the p-adic fractality characterizing
long range real physics and provides an explanation for p-adic length scale hypothesis stating that
the primes p ≃2k, k integer are especially interesting. It also explains the long range correlations
and short term chaos characterizing intentional behavior and explains why the physical realizations
of cognition are always discrete (say in the case of numerical computations). Furthermore, a concrete
quantum model for how intentions are transformed to actions emerges.
The discrete real projections of p-adic space-time sheets serve also space-time correlate for a logical
thought. It is very natural to assign to p-adic pinary digits a p-valued logic but as such this kind
of logic does not have any reasonable identiﬁcation. p-Adic length scale hypothesis suggest that the
p = 2k −n pinary digits represent a Boolean logic Bk with k elementary statements (the points of the
k-element set in the set theoretic realization) with n taboos which are constrained to be identically
true.
p-Adic and dark matter hierarchies and hierarchy of moments of consciousness
Dark matter hierarchy assigned to a spectrum of Planck constant having arbitrarily large values brings
additional elements to the TGD inspired theory of consciousness.
1. Macroscopic quantum coherence can be understood since a particle with a given mass can in
principle appear as arbitrarily large scaled up copies (Compton length scales as ℏ). The phase
transition to this kind of phase implies that space-time sheets of particles overlap and this makes
possible macroscopic quantum coherence.
2. The space-time sheets with large Planck constant can be in thermal equilibrium with ordinary
ones without the loss of quantum coherence. For instance, the cyclotron energy scale associated
with EEG turns out to be above thermal energy at room temperature for the level of dark matter
hierarchy corresponding to magnetic ﬂux quanta of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld with the size scale
of Earth and a successful quantitative model for EEG results [K21] .
Dark matter hierarchy leads to detailed quantitative view about quantum biology with several
testable predictions [K21] . The general prediction is that Universe is a kind of inverted Mandel-
brot fractal for which each bird’s eye of view reveals new structures in long length and time scales
representing scaled down copies of standard physics and their dark variants. These structures would
correspond to higher levels in self hierarchy. This prediction is consistent with the belief that 75 per
cent of matter in the universe is dark.
1. Living matter and dark matter
Living matter as ordinary matter quantum controlled by the dark matter hierarchy has turned out
to be a particularly successful idea. The hypothesis has led to models for EEG predicting correctly the
band structure and even individual resonance bands and also generalizing the notion of EEG [K21]
. Also a generalization of the notion of genetic code emerges resolving the paradoxes related to the

14
Chapter 1. Introduction
standard dogma [K40, K21] . A particularly fascinating implication is the possibility to identify great
leaps in evolution as phase transitions in which new higher level of dark matter emerges [K21] .
It seems safe to conclude that the dark matter hierarchy with levels labelled by the values of
Planck constants explains the macroscopic and macro-temporal quantum coherence naturally. That
this explanation is consistent with the explanation based on spin glass degeneracy is suggested by
following observations. First, the argument supporting spin glass degeneracy as an explanation of
the macro-temporal quantum coherence does not involve the value of ℏat all. Secondly, the failure
of the perturbation theory assumed to lead to the increase of Planck constant and formation of
macroscopic quantum phases could be precisely due to the emergence of a large number of new degrees
of freedom due to spin glass degeneracy. Thirdly, the phase transition increasing Planck constant has
concrete topological interpretation in terms of many-sheeted space-time consistent with the spin glass
degeneracy.
2. Dark matter hierarchy and the notion of self
The vision about dark matter hierarchy leads to a more reﬁned view about self hierarchy and
hierarchy of moments of consciousness [K20, K21] . The larger the value of Planck constant, the
longer the subjectively experienced duration and the average geometric duration T(k) ∝ℏof the
quantum jump.
Quantum jumps form also a hierarchy with respect to p-adic and dark hierarchies and the geometric
durations of quantum jumps scale like ℏ. Dark matter hierarchy suggests also a slight modiﬁcation of
the notion of self. Each self involves a hierarchy of dark matter levels, and one is led to ask whether
the highest level in this hierarchy corresponds to single quantum jump rather than a sequence of
quantum jumps. The averaging of conscious experience over quantum jumps would occur only for
sub-selves at lower levels of dark matter hierarchy and these mental images would be ordered, and
single moment of consciousness would be experienced as a history of events. The quantum parallel
dissipation at the lower levels would give rise to the experience of ﬂow of time. For instance, hadron
as a macro-temporal quantum system in the characteristic time scale of hadron is a dissipating system
at quark and gluon level corresponding to shorter p-adic time scales. One can ask whether even entire
life cycle could be regarded as a single quantum jump at the highest level so that consciousness would
not be completely lost even during deep sleep. This would allow to understand why we seem to know
directly that this biological body of mine existed yesterday.
The fact that we can remember phone numbers with 5 to 9 digits supports the view that self corre-
sponds at the highest dark matter level to single moment of consciousness. Self would experience the
average over the sequence of moments of consciousness associated with each sub-self but there would
be no averaging over the separate mental images of this kind, be their parallel or serial. These mental
images correspond to sub-selves having shorter wake-up periods than self and would be experienced as
being time ordered. Hence the digits in the phone number are experienced as separate mental images
and ordered with respect to experienced time.
3. The time span of long term memories as signature for the level of dark matter hierarchy
The basic question is what time scale can one assign to the geometric duration of quantum jump
measured naturally as the size scale of the space-time region about which quantum jump gives con-
scious information. This scale is naturally the size scale in which the non-determinism of quantum
jump is localized. During years I have made several guesses about this time scales but zero energy
ontology and the vision about fractal hierarchy of quantum jumps within quantum jumps leads to a
unique identiﬁcation.
Causal diamond as an imbedding space correlate of self deﬁnes the time scale τ for the space-
time region about which the consciousness experience is about. The temporal distances between the
tips of CD as come as integer multiples of CP2 length scales and for prime multiples correspond to
what I have christened as secondary p-adic time scales. A reasonable guess is that secondary p-adic
time scales are selected during evolution and the primes near powers of two are especially favored.
For electron, which corresponds to Mersenne prime M127 = 2127 −1 this scale corresponds to .1
seconds deﬁning the fundamental time scale of living matter via 10 Hz biorhythm (alpha rhythm).
The unexpected prediction is that all elementary particles correspond to time scales possibly relevant
to living matter.
Dark matter hierarchy brings additional ﬁnesse. For the higher levels of dark matter hierarchy τ
is scaled up by ℏ/ℏ0. One could understand evolutionary leaps as the emergence of higher levels at

1.3. Bird’s eye of view about the topics of the book
15
the level of individual organism making possible intentionality and memory in the time scale deﬁned
τ.
Higher levels of dark matter hierarchy provide a neat quantitative view about self hierarchy and
its evolution. Various levels of dark matter hierarchy would naturally correspond to higher levels in
the hierarchy of consciousness and the typical duration of life cycle would give an idea about the level
in question. The level would determine also the time span of long term memories as discussed in [K21]
. The emergence of these levels must have meant evolutionary leap since long term memory is also
accompanied by ability to anticipate future in the same time scale. This picture would suggest that
the basic diﬀerence between us and our cousins is not at the level of genome as it is usually understood
but at the level of the hierarchy of magnetic bodies [K40, K21]. In fact, higher levels of dark matter
hierarchy motivate the introduction of the notions of super-genome and hyper-genome. The genomes
of entire organ can join to form super-genome expressing genes coherently. Hyper-genomes would
result from the fusion of genomes of diﬀerent organisms and collective levels of consciousness would
express themselves via hyper-genome and make possible social rules and moral.
1.3
Bird’s eye of view about the topics of the book
This book tries to give an overall view about TGD inspired theory of consciousness as it stands now.
In nutshell TGD based view about consciousness relies following ideas and concepts.
1. The basic notions TGD inspired theory of consciousness are quantum jump identiﬁed as a
moment of consciousness, self identiﬁed as sequence of quantum jumps analogous to bound state
of particles, self hierarchy with sub-selves experienced by self as mental images, and sharing and
fusion of mental images by quantum entanglement.
2. Dark matter hierarchy, the levels of which are labeled by increasing quantized value of Planck
constant, suggests that the geometric durations for the moments of consciousness form deﬁned as
the scale of the space-time volume from which conscious experience is about, form an increasing
hierarchy so that the highest level associated with a given self would correspond to single moment
of consciousness.
This would actually eliminate the notion of self and self hierarchy would
correspond to a fractal hierarchy of quantum jumps.
3. The anatomy of quantum jumps must be consistent with the notions of state preparation, state
function reduction, and unitary evolution and this leads to a detailed view what quantum jump
means for quantum states of the Universe identiﬁed as classical spinor ﬁelds in conﬁguration
space, the ”world of classical worlds”. The zero modes of the conﬁguration space geometry
which do not contribute to its metric and thus do not quantum ﬂuctuate, correspond to classical
observables. A direct connection with quantum measurement theory emerges.
4. Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) deﬁnes the basic variational principle of TGD in-
spired theory of consciousness.
NMP states that the negentropy gain in quantum jump is
maximal. The allowance of a number theoretic variant of Shannon entropy making sense for
rational or algebraic entanglement probabilities implies that quantum jump can also generate
or increase the amount of entanglement. A possible interpretation is in terms of bound state
entanglement to which conscious information can be assigned.
5. A natural characterization of the fundamental qualia is in terms of quantum number increments
associated with the quantum jump. The classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action (in the usual
sense of the world) means that the contents of the conscious experience of a given self comes
from a 4-dimensional space-time region rather than representing 3-D snapshot of space-time.
This together with the new view about energy and time (negative energies and communications
to the geometric past are predicted) leads to a new vision about memory, intentional action,
and also metabolism.
6. p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intentionality is a genuinely new element as compared
to the existing theories of consciousness and forces to give up the view that cognition is localized
in the sense of real physics. Indeed, p-adic space-time sheets representing intentions have liter-
ally inﬁnite size since most p-adic integers, in particular those which are inﬁnitesimally small,

16
Chapter 1. Introduction
have inﬁnitely large as real numbers. Cognition would quite literally see the real cosmos from
outside. The transformations of p-adic space-time sheets to real ones in quantum jump deﬁne
an attractive view about what happens when intention transforms to an action and is consistent
with TGD based view about energy (also negative inertial energies are possible and the density
of inertial energy vanishes in cosmological length scales). The discrete rational projection of
p-adic space-time sheets to the real imbedding space is excellent candidate for the realization of
cognitive representations at the level of space-time since p-adic numbers deﬁne very naturally a
generalization of binary logic and for primes satisfying p-adic length scale hypothesis the result-
ing logic has also Boolean interpretation as a logic in which certain number of statements are
taboos so that the number of allowed statements is reduced from 2k to p = 2k −n.
7. The new view about the relationship between experienced and geometric time inspires a general
model of memory, intentional action, and metabolism. In this model time mirror mechanism
meaning communications with geometric past using negative energy (phase conjugate photons)
is in central role. Also time-like entanglement plays a key role in the model of memories. A
precise conceptualization for this vision is provided by zero energy ontology in which M-matrix
generalizes S-matrix. M-matrix is identiﬁable as the ”square” root of density matrix deﬁnes time
like entanglement coeﬃcients between positive and negative energy parts of the zero energy state
located at past and future boundaries of the causal diamond deﬁned by the intersection of future
and past directed light-cones.
The topics of the book are organized in the following manner.
1. In the ﬁrst part of the book TGD inspired theory of consciousness is discussed at general level.
There are three summarizing chapters give a view about how ideas have evolved. Besides this
there are chapters devoted to Negentropy Maximization Principle, to a detailed exposition of
the notion of self, and to a model of sensory representations.
2. The second part of the book contains two chapters about the relationship between experienced
and geometric time. The ﬁrst one is more than decade old. The second one - inspired by zero
energy ontology and written quite recently - provides a rather detailed vision about how the
arrow of geometric time correlating with the arrow of experienced time and the localization of
the contents of sensory experience to a narrow time interval emerge. The chapter explaining
TGD based view about long term memory is also included.
3. The third part of the book summarizes roughly decade old view about intelligence and cog-
nition. p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intentionality and many-fermion states as
representations of Boolean statements are the key notions. In zero energy ontology also quantal
versions of logical rules A →B realized as quantum variants of Boolean functions emerge at
the fundamental level. A chapter about the role of dark matter hierarchy, in particular about
topological quantum computation as a universal information processing tool, would be needed
to make the picture more complete.
4. The fourth chapter is devoted to remote mental interactions. The theoretical motivation for
taking remote mental interactions seriously is that exactly the same mechanisms which are
involved with the interaction between magnetic body and biological body apply also to remote
mental interactions in TGD Universe. One could also understand why these phenomena are
rare: a kind of immune system making it impossible for foreign magnetic bodies to control
and communicate with the biological body possessed by a particular magnetic body would be a
highly probable (but perhaps not unavoidable) outcome of evolutionary process.
The seven online books about TGD [K88, K67, K68, K77, K54, K48, K76] and eight online books
about TGD inspired theory of consciousness and quantum biology [K81, K9, K60, K7, K30, K38, K42,
K75] are warmly recommended for the reader willing to get overall view about what is involved.

SCIOUSNESS
TGD Inspired Quantum Theory of Consciousness and of Bio-systems: an Overall View
The purpose of this chapter is to represent a bird eye’s of view about the basic ideas of TGD inspired
consciousness and its applications to living matter. The notion of many-sheeted space-time, dark
matter hierarchy with levels by the values of dynamical quantized Planck constant, and the resulting
basic vision about bio-systems as macroscopic quantum systems are summarized. The basic ideas
and concepts of TGD inspired theory of consciousness are reviewed. Discussed are also the recent
views about how local p-adic physics codes for the long range correlations of the real physics as p-adic
fractality and how p-adic space-time sheets provide correlates for cognition and intentionality.
Matter, Mind, Quantum
This chapter is devoted to the TGD inspired theory of consciousness, which can be also regarded as a
generalization of quantum measurement theory. TGD inspired theory of consciousness could be seen
as a generalization of quantum measurement theory to make observer, which in standard quantum
measurement theory remains an outsider, a genuine part of physical system subject to laws of quantum
physics. The basic notions are quantum jump identiﬁed as moment of consciousness and the notion
of self: in zero energy ontology these notions might however reduce to each other. Negentropy Max-
imization Principle deﬁnes the dynamics of consciousness and as a special case reproduces standard
quantum measurement theory.
1. Quantum jump as moment of consciousness
TGD suggests that the quantum jump between quantum histories could identiﬁed as moment of
consciousness and could therefore be for consciousness theory what elementary particle is for physics.
This means that subjective time evolution corresponds to the sequence of quantum jumps Ψi →
UΨi →Ψf consisting of unitary process followed by state function process. Originally U was thought
to be the TGD counterpart of the unitary time evolution operator U(−t, t), t →∞, associated with
the scattering solutions of Schr¨odinger equation.
It seems however impossible to assign any real
Scr¨odinger time evolution with U. In zero energy ontology U deﬁnes a unitary matrix between zero
energy states and is naturally assignable to intentional actions whereas the ordinary S-matrix telling
what happens in particle physics experiment (for instance) generalizes to M-matrix deﬁning time-like
entanglement between positive and negative energy parts of zero energy states. One might say that U
process corresponds to a fundamental act of creation creating a quantum superposition of possibilities
and the remaining steps generalizing state function reduction process select between them.
2. Negentropy Maximization Principle and the notion of self
U-process is followed by a sequence of state function reductions. Negentropy Maximization Princi-
ple (NMP) states that in a given quantum state the most quantum entangled subsystem-complement
pair can perform the quantum jump. More precisely: the reduction of the entanglement entropy in
the quantum jump is as large as possible. This selects the pair in question and in case of ordinary
entanglement entropy leads the selected pair to a product state. The interpretation of the reduc-
tion of the entanglement entropy as conscious information gain makes sense. The sequence of state
function reductions decomposes at ﬁrst step the entire system to two parts in such a manner that
the reduction entanglement entropy is maximal. This process repeats itself for subsystems. If the
subsystem in question cannot be divided into a pair of entangled free system the process stops since
energy conservation does not allow it to occur (binding energy).
The original deﬁnition of self was as a subsystem able to remain unentangled under state function
reductions associated with subsequent quantum jumps. Everything is consciousness but consciousness
can be lost if self develops bound state entanglement during U process so that state function reduction
to smaller un-entangled pieces is impossible.
The existence of number theoretical entanglement entropies in the intersection of real and various
p-adic worlds force to modify this picture. The reduction process can stop also if the self in question
allows only decompositions to pairs systems with negentropic entanglement. This does not require

18
Chapter 1. Introduction
that that the system forms a bound state for any pair of subsystems so that the systems decomposing
it can be free (no binding energy). This deﬁnes a new kind of bound state not describable as a jail
deﬁned by the bottom of a potential well. Subsystems are free but remain correlated by negentropic
entanglement.
The ordinary state function reductions imply dissipation crucial for self organization and quantum
jump could be regarded as the basic step of an iteration like process leading to the asympotic self-
organization patterns. One could regard dissipation as a Darwinian selector as in standard theories of
self-organization. NMP thus predicts that self organization and hence presumably also fractalization
can occur inside selves. NMP would favor the generation of negentropic entanglement. This notion
is highly attractive since it could allow to understand how quantum selforganization generates larger
coherent structures. Note that state function reduction for negentropic entanglement is highly deter-
ministic since the number of degenerate states with same negative entanglement entropy is expected
to be small. This could allow to understand how living matter is able to develop almost deterministic
cellular automaton like behaviors.
The chapter is devoted to the discussion of detailed implications of these general ideas. The topics
to be discussed include following basic questions.
1. How the general structure for the contents of consciousness of self are determined? The basic
assumption is that self hierarchy in which subselves deﬁne mental images of self is responsible
for the general structure of conscious experience. Zero energy ontology allows to derive the
space-time correlates of selves.
2. How the physical realization of the hardware of consciousness diﬀers from that assumed in
neuroscience? Here the notion of magnetic body as intentional agent using biological body as
motor instrument and sensory receptor is central.
3. What is the precise relationship between the geometric time of physicist and subjective time
identiﬁed in terms of a sequence of quantum jumps?
Zero energy ontology gives the most
convincing answer to this question found hitherto.
4. What can one one say about various types of conscious experience in the proposed framework.
This includes p-adic description of cognition and intentional action, model for sensory experience
and sensory qualia, model for Boolean mind in terms of fermions, a model for directed attention,
ideas about emotions, and also a general interpretation for altered states of consciousness based
on the special features of negentgropic entanglement.
5. Can one provide solutions to the paradoxes of quantum physics, theories of consciousness, and
logic in the proposed conceptual framework?
The discussion diﬀers considerably from the earlier one.
The reason is that the developments
occurred during period 2005-2010 (zero energy ontology, hierarchy of Planck constants assigned to
dark matter, hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1, implications of the number theoretical negentropies)
are introduced from the beginning to the formulation of the theory rather than as additions to the
existing text so that the representation is more coherent and the number of internal inconsistencies is
minimized.
Negentropy Maximization Principle
In TGD Universe the moments of consciousness are associated with quantum jumps between quantum
histories. The proposal is that the dynamics of consciousness is governed by Negentropy Maximization
Principle, which states the information content of conscious experience is maximal. The formulation
of NMP is the basic topic of this chapter.
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) codes for the dynamics of standard state function
reduction and states that the state function reduction process following U-process gives rise to a
maximal reduction of entanglement entropy at each step. In the generic case this implies at each step
a decomposition of the system to unique unentangled subsystems and the process repeats itself for
these subsystems. The process stops when the resulting subsystem cannot be decomposed to a pair of
free systems since energy conservation makes the reduction of entanglement kinematically impossible

in the case of bound states. The natural assumption is that self loses consciousness when it entangles
via bound state entanglement.
There is an important exception to this vision based on ordinary Shannon entropy. There exists
an inﬁnite hierarchy of number theoretical entropies making sense for rational or even algebraic entan-
glement probabilities. In this case the entanglement negentropy can be negative so that NMP favors
the generation of negentropic entanglement, which need not be bound state entanglement in standard
sense. Negentropic entanglement might serve as a correlate for emotions like love and experience of
understanding. The reduction of ordinary entanglement entropy to random ﬁnal state implies second
law at the level of ensemble. For the generation of negentropic entanglement the outcome of the
reduction is not random: the prediction is that second law is not a universal truth holding true in all
scales. Since number theoretic entropies are natural in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds, this
suggests that life resides in this intersection. The existence eﬀectively bound states with no binding
energy might have important implications for the understanding the stability of basic bio-polymers
and the key aspects of metabolism. A natural assumption is that self experiences expansion of con-
sciousness as it entangles in this manner. Quite generally, an inﬁnite self hierarchy with the entire
Universe at the top is predicted.
The identiﬁcation of life as a number theoretically critical phenomenon is also consistent with
the idea that the transformation of intention to action corresponds to a U-process inducing leakage
between diﬀerent sectors.
This leakage makes sense in the intersection where same mathematical
expression deﬁnes both real and p-adic partonic 2-surfaces which are the fundamental objects in TGD
framework. What these statements really mean requires a construction of number theoretical variant
of quantum theory applying in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
Besides number theoretic negentropies there are also other new elements as compared to the earlier
formulation of NMP. Zero energy ontology modiﬁes dramatically the formulation of NMP since U-
matrix acts between zero energy states and can be regarded as a collection of M-matrices, which
generalize the ordinary S-matrix and deﬁne what might be called a complex square root of density
matrix so that kind of a square root of thermodynamics at single particle level justifying also p-adic
mass calculations based on p-adic thermodynamics is in question. The hierarchy of Planck constants is
a further new element having important implications for conciousness and biology. Hyper-ﬁnite factors
of type II1 represent an additional technical complication requiring separate treatment of NMP taking
into account ﬁnite measurement resolution realized in terms of inclusions of these factors.
NMP has important implications for thermodynamics. In particular, one must give up the standard
view about second law and replace it with a formulation taking into accoung the hierarchy of causal
diamonds assigned with zero energy ontology and dark matter hierarchy labeled partially by the values
of Planck constants, as well as the eﬀects due to negentropic entanglement. In particular, in the case
of living matter breaking of second law in standard sense is expected to take place and be crucial for
the understanding of evolution. Self hierarchy having the hierarchy of causal diamonds as imbedding
space correlate leads naturally to a thermodynamical description of the contents of consciousness and
quantum jumps is very much analogous to quantum computation. This leads to a vision about the
role of bound state entanglement and negentropic entanglement in the generation of sensory qualia.
Negentropic entanglement leads to a vision about cognition. Negentropically entangled state consisting
of a superposition of pairs can be interpreted as a conscious abstraction or rule: negentropically
entangled Schr¨odinger cat knows that it is better to keep the bottle closed. A connection with fuzzy
qubits and quantum groups with negentropic entanglement is highly suggestive. The implications
are highly non-trivial also for quantum computation, which allows three diﬀerent variants in TGD
context. The negentropic variant would correspond to conscious quantum computation like process.
Self and Binding
The quantum notion of self solved some longstanding problems of TGD inspired theory of conscious-
ness and led to a breakthrough in quantum theory of consciousness. Self is identiﬁed as a sub-system
able to not generate bound state entanglement during quantum jumps. Generation of bound state
entanglement leads to a loss of consciousness whereas negentropic entanglement possible in the inter-
section of real and p-adic worlds involves experience about expansion of consciousness.
With the advent of the hierarchy of Planck constants realized in terms of generalized imbedding
space and of zero energy ontology emerged the idea that self hierarchy could be reduced to a fractal
hierarchy of quantum jumps within quantum jumps. It seems now clear that the two deﬁnitions of

20
Chapter 1. Introduction
self are consistent with each other. The identiﬁcation of the imedding space correlate of self as causal
diamond (CD) of the imbedding space combined with the identiﬁcation of space-time correlates as
space-time sheets inside CD solved also the problems concerning the relationship between geometric
and subjective time.
Subjective memory is assumed to correspond to an average of conscious experiences of quantum
jumps occurred after the last wake-up of self. This leads to the identiﬁcation of qualia as averages of
the increments of quantum numbers and zero modes in the ensemble of quantum jumps deﬁning self.
Summation hypothesis states that self X experiences the experiences of its subselves as abstracted
experiences, averages Xij about sub-subselves Xij. Subselves of un-entangled selves can entangle (this
is due to the many-sheeted sub-system concept) and this allows fusion and sharing of mental images.
Quantum entanglement provides a mechanism leading to the formation of irreducible wholes at
the level of mental images. Entanglement can be entropic bound state entanglement or negentropic
entanglement, which need not involve binding energy. The latter is possible only in the intersection
of real and p-adic worlds where life can be said to reside. Quantum entanglement is possible also
in time direction in zero energy ontology. It is tempting to assign negatively colored emotions to
the entropic entanglement and positive emotions to the negentropic one.
In TGD framework the
standard vision about brain based on reductionistic-holistic dichotomy must be replaced with a trinity
in which negentropic entanglement corresponds to a mode of cognition, which does not allow linguistic
expression and episodal memories, and various mental feats of synesthetes and idiot savants could
be seen as a manifestation of negentropic entanglement.
Also meditative consciousness would be
negentropic.
Selves are called irreducible if they possess no subselves, otherwise reducible. Subselves correspond
to mental images so that irreducible subselves possess no mental images and are in a state of pure
self-awareness: it is not clear whether this kind of states are possible in practice. When the subselves
of self fuse to single negentropic subself, a state of ”one-ness” results in somewhat diﬀerent sense.
This mode of consciousness can be identiﬁed as ”whole-body” consciousness and diﬀers from ordinary
consciousness during which self has large number of mental images. These modes could naturally
explain emotional/holistic and rational modes of mind.
These two modes could make it possible
to understand various dichotomies like brain/left brain, emotional/analytic, religous/rational, East-
ern/Western,... One could understand linear cognitive processes like thinking and language as self
cascades in which self decomposes into subselves, which in turn decompose into subselves, which ...
and self hierarchy implies connection with computationalism.
The possibility of negentropic entanglement has profound implications. It leads to a vision about
learning as a basic quantum process possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and made
possible because state function reduction ceases to be a random process for negentropically entangled
zero energy states. Quite concrete ideas about the role of synaptic transmission and neural transmitters
for consciousness emerge.
Music experience provides an especially interesting application for the
vision about consciousness and zero energy ontology together with number theoretical vision inspires
several concrete interpretations. Synchronous ﬁring of neurons- in particular at 40 Hz frequency-
is an attractive correlate for the negentropic entanglement and synesthesia can be interpreted as a
particular manifestatios of negentropic entanglement.
In TGD framework it is not at all obvious that the highest levels of our personal self hierarchy
should correspond to the size of the physical body. Various empirical facts, in particular the obser-
vations related to the special eﬀects of excitations of geomagnetic ﬁelds and ELF em ﬁelds in EEG
frequency range on brain, inspire the hypothesis that our selves correspond to topological ﬁeld quanta
of em ﬁelds associated with EEG frequencies and thus by Uncertainty Principle have size scale of
Earth. This leads to a rather radical modiﬁcation of the brain centered views about consciousness,
and one can quite seriously consider the questions like what physical death means from the point of
view of consciousness: it could be that electromagnetic part of self hierarchy could survive after the
physical death as a ’soul’.
Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
One of the toughest challenges of quantum theories of consciousness is to understand how sensory
representations are constructed at quantum level.
It became as a surprise that the vision about
sensory representation which resulted from a long lasting thought experimentation is actually very
much what the original experience about myself as a computer sitting at its own terminal, when taken

1.4. The contents of the book
21
very literally in some aspects, actually suggests. This vision adds to the standard view about brain an
additional layer responsible for the sensory representations and brings in the quantum level of control
so that nerve pulse patterns are only part of the control loop. In fact, it has turned out that the
same basic theory applies to both geometric memories, precognition, sensory perception, and motor
actions. The vision goes as follows.
1. As far as our consciousness is considered, primary sensory organs are the seats of sensory qualia
and brain only constructs cognitive and symbolic representations. Various objections against
this hypothesis can be circumvented by assuming that sensory organs entangle with the brain.
The question how imagination diﬀers from the sensory experience becomes trivial, and dreams
and hallucinations can be understood as resulting via the back-projection of the imagined mental
images to the primary sensory organs.
2. Libet’s ﬁndings about passive aspects of consciousness lead to the view that sensory percept can
be regarded as a geometric memory in time scale of .5 seconds involving entanglement with the
geometric past mediated by negative energy MEs. Libet’s experiments about the active aspects
of consciousness in turn lead to realization that motor actions and sensory perceptions are in
a well-deﬁned sense time-reversals of each other: pre-cognition is a deﬁnite aspect of motor
action. One can say that motor action at the level of negative energy MEs is initiated from
the level of muscles rather than brain and motor imagination is just a motor action starting
from some level higher than muscles. The transformation of a p-adic ME to negative energy ME
realizes the transformation of intention to action in a precisely targeted manner and the emission
of negative energy makes possible extreme ﬂexibility by buy now-let others pay mechanism of
remote metabolism. This process is the basic step initiating motor action, neural activity leading
to imagery, and active memory recall. This picture also explains why geometric memories occur
more or less spontaneously whereas precognition is a rare phenomenon (pre-cognizer must receive
negative energy MEs).
3. In TGD framework one can assign to any material structure a magnetic body having much large
size. The closed ﬂux loops composing magnetic bodies allow an elegant realization of the long
term memories in terms of negative and positive energy MEs. A stronger hypothesis is that
various magnetic bodies deﬁne sensory canvases at which various sensory representations are
realized. Motor action can be seen as a geometric time reversal of sensory perception. Cortex
can be seen as a collection of pre-existing symbolic and cognitive features possibly entangled
with sensory mental images at sensory organs, and activated when they appear in the perceptive
ﬁeld or form a part of motor action. The basic task of the central nervous system is to identify
these features from the sensory input. The mental images associated with various parts of the
physical body are entangled with the points of the correspondin magnetic bodies representing
objects of the perceptive ﬁeld by sharing of mental images and in this manner deﬁne attributes
of these objects. There is an entire hierarchy of representations corresponding to the hierarchy of
magnetic bodies, and also sensory perception involves active selections by entangling a sequences
of mental images deﬁning paths along the tree-like structure deﬁned by the hierarchy of magnetic
bodies beginning from the personal magnetic body and ending at the roots deﬁned by magnetic
bodies of sensory organs. This explains phenomena like sensory rivalry.
4. The decomposition of the perceptive ﬁeld to objects is one of the basic aspects of sensory
experiencing and TGD provides a mechanism generating these objects as space-time sheets: the
boundaries of these objects correspond to regions of strong K¨ahler electric ﬁeld whose strength
is assumed to correlate with the intensity of the neural input. It might be that even the objects
of perceptive ﬁeld or thoughts could be regarded as features. In zero energy ontology causal
diamonds become the imbedding space correlates of mental images and one can ask whether
Negentropy Maximization Principle -perhaps suitably generalized- could force their generation.
5. The computational activities associated with the construction of the sensory representations (say
estimating distances and directions of the objects of perceptive ﬁeld) and virtual sensory repre-
sentations representing the goals of motor action are presumably realized as iterated processes
in which virtual sensory inputs characterizing the expected experiences are compared with the
real world sensory input. In a similar manner the goal of the motor action is compared with the

22
Chapter 1. Introduction
sensory representation resulting from eﬀect of a virtual motor action on the representation of
the recent state of world and body. This comparison does not necessarily require sensory rep-
resentation at any level of the self hierarchy and could be based on comparison circuits deﬁned
by parallel supra currents in which the inputs which are suﬃciently near to each other generate
constructive interference giving rise to a large Josephson current.
6. Zero energy ontology together with the notion of causal diamond (CD) identiﬁed as imbedding
space correlate of self and the moduli space of CDs, the description of dark matter in terms of a
hierarchy of Planck constants implying a generalization of the notion of the imbedding space, and
the vision about living matter as something residing in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds
and carrying positive entanglement negentropy allow to make this vision more detailed and lead
to surprisingly precise quantitative predictions and connect the basic biological time scales to
those assignable to elementary particles in zero energy ontology. The notion of spectroscopy of
consciousness can be formulated for the geometric aspects of conscious experience in terms of
the moduli space of causal diamonds and the frequencies of the generalized EEG.
1.4.2
PART II: TIME AND CONSCIOUSNESS
Time and Consciousness
In moments of consciousness as quantum jumps between quantum histories picture the basic challenge
is to explain how psychological time arises: why the contents of at least sensory experiences are con-
centrated around a deﬁnite value of geometric time and what is the origin of the arrow of psychological
time. It has become gradually clear that TGD cannot reproduce the common sense conception of time
and that one can only require that the generalized view is consistent with our restricted conscious
experiences and shows our position in the hierarchy of consciousness.
The understanding of the notion of psychological time and its arrow - or equivalently, the rela-
tionship between subjective and geometric time - turned out to be quite diﬃcult challenge and led
to a handful of proposals based on the identiﬁcation of space-time sheet as a correlate of self and the
idea that the experienced ﬂow of geometric correspond to some kind of motion in space-time or in
imbedding space. These identiﬁcations did not lead to anything practical and generated paradoxes.
The most recent proposal involves no ad hoc assumptions and relies on the formulation of quantum
TGD using zero energy ontology. The correlate of self is now so called causal diamond (pair of future
and past directed light-cones) which is 8-D sub-manifold of the imbedding space rather than space-time
sheet. The ﬂow of geometric time is apparent and due the change of quantum state in quantum jump
which in the ﬁrst approximation means a shift of the quantum superposition of space-time surfaces
to the direction of the geometric past of the imbedding space. This proposal allows to understand
the asymmetry between geometric future and past at the level of conscious experience and makes also
precise quantitative predictions. Also a uniﬁcation of the deﬁnition of self identifying it as a sequence
of quantum jumps and of the deﬁnition based on the reduction of self hierarchy to a fractal hierarchy
of quantum jumps within quantum jumps becomes possible.
The concept of self led to the understanding of the subjective memory as an average over experi-
ences of self experienced after its ”wake-up”. Subjective memories are always about past. Geometric
memories are predictions for the future/past assuming that no quantum jumps would occur after/had
occurred before the one giving rise to the geometric memory.
Pre-cognitions can be seen as geo-
metric memories about future. Intentions are p-adic variants of precognitions. It seems that long
term memories must correspond to geometric memories: this hypothesis, when combined with the
spin glass model of brain, the notion of quantum self-organization, and some key aspects of many-
sheeted physics, allows to understand the basic aspects of the long term memory and avoids the basic
diﬃculties of the neural net models.
”Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny” principle suggests that the structure of the many-sheeted
space-time represents the structure of the cosmology of consciousness. This heuristic principle to-
gether with the concept of self, the hypothesis that also inﬁnite primes are present in the topological
condensate and association sequence concept, leads to a Grand Scenario for the cosmology of con-
sciousness. There is no need to assume that diﬀerent irreducible sub-experiences associated with given
moment of consciousness correspond to a common value of the psychological time. Most naturally,
the values of psychological time extending from zero to strictly inﬁnite values of time and beyond(!)

1.4. The contents of the book
23
are present. This means that cosmology of consciousness has fractal like structure: there are sub-
cosmologies which know nothing about each other’s existence except in quantum jumps involving
entanglement with larger space-time sheets: in this case the conscious experience could be regarded
as a religious or mystic experience. Both future and past civilizations participate in each quantum
jump. The allowance of inﬁnite primes suggested strongly by various arguments, means that conscious
intelligences which are God like as compared to us, participate in each quantum jump.
An especially important general consequence is the paradigm of 4-dimensional brain.
1. This paradigm trivializes the problem of long term memory. The desire to remember would
be quantum communicated from the geometric now to the geometric past by sharing of mental
images made possible by time-like quantum entanglement of sub-selves. In the case of episodal
memories the sharing of mental images gives already rise to the memory.
For non-episodal
memories the memory is communicated classically to the geometric future. An essential element
of the mechanism are negative energy MEs (”massless extremals”) which are ideal for generating
time-like quantum entanglement with the geometric past.
Positive energy MEs are in turn
involved with classical communications.
2. Second consequence is a model of cognition relying on the concept of cognitive neutrino pair:
cognitive neutrino pair has almost vanishing total energy and consists of neutrino and antineu-
trino residing at diﬀerent space-time sheets. The cornerstone of the model is the negative energy
of the condensed matter neutrinos deriving from the classical Z0 interaction with nuclear Z0
charges.
Thus one can say that TGD predicts that k = 169 space-time sheet (L(169) ≃5
microns) is the length scale in which cognitive consciousness emerges.
Quantum jumps between quantum histories concept explains the peculiar time delays of conscious-
ness revealed in the experiments relating to active and passive roles of consciousness and the causal
anomalies revealed by the experiments of Radin and Bierman. TGD predicts ”tribar eﬀect” as a
general signature for the quantum jump between quantum histories concept.
Quantum Model of Memory
The neural realization of long term memories has remained to a high extent a mystery in the frame-
work of the standard brain science. The TGD based quantum model for memory have developed
gradually from the basic realization that in TGD framework the identiﬁcation of quantum states as
quantum histories makes it un-necessary to store information about the geometric past to the geo-
metric now. The process was not by no means a mechanical deduction of the consequences of some
basic postulates. For instance, the understanding of the relationship between geometric and subjec-
tive time developed through several erratic models and only a formulation of quantum TGD led to a
quantitative formulation.
The new view about time has deep implications concerning the understanding of memory.
a) It is possible to separate genuine geometric memory recall from apparent memory recalls such
as feature recognition, associations, and implicit and procedural memories. There are no memory
storages in brain and only memory representations abstracting the essential aspects of experience are
needed.
b) The models of long term memory based on the assumption that information about the geometric
past is stored in the recent state of the system predict that the new memories should mask the old
ones. It is however known that childhood memories are the stablest ones. In TGD framework this
ceases to be a problem.
Mirror mechanism provides a very general mechanism of long term memory. To remember some-
thing at a temporal distance T in the geometric past is to look at a mirror at a distance cT/2. If the
mirror is quantum mirror only a timelike entanglement (allowed by the non-determinism of K¨ahler
action) of the mental image of the geometric past with a mental image in brain now is needed. The
un-necessity to communicate memories classically implies extreme generality of the mechanism: all
kinds of memories: sensory, cognitive, verbal,.... can be recalled in this manner. Even the mechanism
of memory recall by cue can be generalized since the notion of tele association makes in principle
sense.
The basic objections against this over-simpliﬁed picture is that there is no guarantee that the
reﬂected ME returns to the brain and that there is no control over the time span of long term memories.

24
Chapter 1. Introduction
The notion of magnetic body allows a more realistic formulation. Brain or the personal magnetic body
generates spontaneously negative energy MEs with all fundamental frequencies. These MEs can be
also curved and are parallel to the closed ﬂux tubes deﬁning the personal magnetic body and connect
geometric now with the brain of the geometric past: multiple reﬂections are probably required to
achieve this. The length of the closed magnetic loop deﬁnes the time span of the corresponding long
term memory. The sharing of mental images by timelike entanglement allows to communicate the
desire to remember to the geometric past, and gives rise to the memory recall in the case of episodal
memories. In the case of non-episodal/declarative memories the memory is communicated from the
brain of the geometric past by classical communications using positive positive energy MEs which
propagate with an eﬀective phase velocity much lower than light velocity along closed magnetic ﬂux
tubes and generate in the receiving end symbolic representation of the memory.
Macro-temporal quantum coherence is further important piece of the model. The understanding
of how macro-temporal quantum coherence is made possible by the spin glass degeneracy led to a
concrete realization of the mirror model and also provided a connection with the ideas of Hameroﬀ
and Penrose. When a bound state is formed the zero modes of the bound state entangled subsystems
become quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom. This means that state function reduction and state
preparation cease to occur in these degrees of freedom. The bound state is in a kind of long-lasting
multiverse state, or state of ’oneness’ experientially, and the sequence of quantum jumps deﬁned by the
duration of the bound state behaves eﬀectively as a single quantum jump. Macro-temporal quantum
coherence making possible supercomputer like activities becomes possible.
The spin glass degeneracy associated with the join along boundaries bonds (the space-time cor-
relates for the bound state formation) lengthens the lifetimes of the bound states dramatically and
solves thus the basic objections against quantum consciousness. The spin glass degeneracy is due to
classical gravitational energy of the system. The quantum jumps between diﬀerent classical gravita-
tional conﬁgurations involve the emission of gravitational (equivalently Z0) MEs and the intention
to remember is realized as a transformation of p-adic ME to negative energy gravitational ME. The
fact that classical gravitational ﬁelds couple to classical gauge ﬁelds with a coupling which is about
108 stronger than the ordinary gravitational coupling, could play an important role too. Water clus-
ters and macromolecules with sizes in the range of cell membrane thickness and cell size are good
candidates for generating gravitonic MEs responsible for all geometric memories. Also classical Z0
interaction might be involved since gravitonic MEs can be regarded also as Z0 MEs.
This picture was not yet quite enough. A generalization of quantum theory based on the introduc-
tion of a hierarchy of Planck constants realized in terms of generalization of the concept of imbedding
space motivated by anomalies of astrophysics and biology led to a quantitative model for how macro-
scopic and macro-temporal quantum coherence could be realized in living matter. Also a quantitative
view about memory emerges. A rather detailed neuro level model of long term memory is developed
and the model conforms nicely with the basic facts known about the relationship of hippocampus and
long term memory.
About the Nature of Time
The identiﬁcation of the experienced time te and geometric time tg involves well-known problems.
Physicist is troubled by the reversibility of tg contra irreversibility of te, by the conﬂict between
determinism of Schr¨odinger equation and the non-determinism of state function reduction, and by the
poorly understood the origin of the arrow of tg. In biology the second law of thermodynamics might be
violated in its standard form for short time intervals. Neuroscientist knows that the moment of sensory
experience has a ﬁnite duration, does not understand what memories really are, and is bothered by
the Libet’s puzzling ﬁnding that neural activity seems to precede conscious decision. These problems
are discussed in the framework of Topological Geometrodynamics (TGD) and TGD inspired theory of
consciousness constructed as a generalization of quantum measurement theory. In TGD space-times
are regarded as 4-dimensional surfaces of 8-dimensional space-time H = M 4 × CP2 and obey classical
ﬁeld equations. The basic notions of consciousness theory are quantum jump and self. Subjective
time is identiﬁed as a sequence of quantum jumps. Self has as a geometric correlate a ﬁxed volume of
H- ”causal diamond”-deﬁning the perceptive ﬁeld of self. Quantum states are regarded as quantum
superpositions of space-time surfaces of H and by quantum classical correspondence assumed to shift
towards the geometric past of H quantum jump by quantum jump. This creates the illusion that
perceiver moves to the direction of the geometric future. Self is curious about the geometric future

and induces the shift bringing it to its perceptive ﬁeld. Macroscopic quantum coherence and the
identiﬁcation of space-times as surfaces in H play a crucial role in this picture allowing to understand
also other problematic aspects in the relationship between experienced and geometric time.
1.4.3
PART III: INTELLIGENCE, INFORMATION, AND COGNITION
Conscious Information and Intelligence
The notions of information and intelligence are discussed in TGD framework. Possible deﬁnitions for
the information measures of the conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld and information gain of conscious
experience as well as the information theoretic interpretation of K¨ahler action are discussed in detail
the ﬁrst sections of the chapter.
1. The key element of the approach is the number theoretic generalization of entanglement entropy.
Quantum entanglement between real and p-adic degrees of freedom makes sense if entanglement
coeﬃcients are rational or even algebraic numbers. In this case one can deﬁne entanglement
entropy using the p-adic variant of the logarithm. p-Adic entropy can be also negative, and
the states for which the entropy is negative are stable against self measurements (NMP) and
deﬁne macrotemporally quantum coherent states. The number-theoretic entropy serves as an
information measure for cognitive entanglement, and positive entanglement negentropy can be
interpreted as a correlate for the experience of understanding. Number theoretic entanglement
measures are natural in what might be called the intersection of real and p-adic worlds (partonic
2-surfaces have mathematical representations making sense both p-adically and in real sense)
and this leads to a vision about life as something residing in this intersection.
2. Various measures for the information contents of consciousness are discussed.
(a) The reduction of entanglement entropy deﬁnes a natural measure for conscious information
gain in single step of the state of state function reduction process decomposing subsystem
to a pair of un-entangled sub-systems. If entanglement is negentropic the entanglement
negentropy either increases or the system is stable against state function reduction.
(b) It seems natural to assume that the information measures are associated with the entire
cascade and that they are additive in the sense that information gain is sum over the
information gains of the steps of the cascade and that a given step contributes by the sum
of the information gains associated with unentangled subsystems which are subject to self
measurement in a given step of the cascade.
(c) One can also assign information measures to the resulting indecomposable systems. For
subsystem which is bound state in the normal sense and thus has entropic entanglement,
one can consider all possible decomposition of the system to a sub-system and its com-
plement and deﬁne the entanglement negentropy as the negative for the minimum value
of entropy obtained in this manner. If the system is negentropically entangled one can
deﬁne entanglement negentropy as the maximum of entanglement negentropy obtained in
this manner. This means that one can assign to the ﬁnal state of state function reduction
unique negentropy as the sum of the negative contributions associated with selves which
are internally bound state entangled and positive contributions of negentropic selves.
(d) The information content of the conscious experience associated with self is more inter-
esting practically. Since self deﬁnes a statistical ensemble, it is straightforward to deﬁne
entropies associated with the increments of quantum numbers and zero modes deﬁning non-
geometric and geometric qualia. These entropies characterize the fuzziness of the quale and
are ’negative’ information measures. One can also assign to non-decomposable subselves
the information measures and they give either positive or negative contribution to the
information content of self.
(e) In principle this allows to deﬁne also the net information gain of quantum jump as the dif-
ference of the total negentropies of the ﬁnal and initial states of quantum jump identiﬁed as
those produced by the state function reduction process. Initial and ﬁnal state negentropies
would characterize spinor ﬁelds of WCW (”world of classical worlds”).

Chapter 1. Introduction
3. Information theoretic interpretation of the K¨ahler function is discussed in detail.
Quantum
classical correspondence suggests that the magnetic part of K¨ahler action would correspond to
information content of negentropic entanglement and electric part to the negative information
content of entropic bound state entanglement. K¨ahler functiond deﬁned as the negative of the
K¨ahler action can be interpreted as an entropy type measure for the information content of
the space-time surface.
Without quantum criticality entropic conﬁgurations carrying strong
K¨ahler electric ﬁelds would be favored. The proposal is that the quantum criticality of K¨ahler
action possible for the critical value of K¨ahler coupling strength makes possible large degeneracy
of the negentropic extremals carrying large K¨ahler magnetic action and makes TGD universe
maximally interesting and maximizes its intelligence so that even inﬁnite negentropy is possible.
Number theoretical criticality would relate to this criticality very closely. The proposal that
living matter is near vacuum extremal so that the degeneracy of negentropic conﬁgurations is
high is discussed.
Concerning the modelling of conscious intelligence the following aspects are important.
1. Zero energy states -which replace the earlier notion of association sequence inspired by the failure
of strict determinism for K¨ahler action in standard sense - can be seen as memes with M-matrices
characterizing the time-like entanglement representing ”laws of physics”. Negentropic time like
entanglement makes possible for fully state function reduced states to represent rules as quantum
superposition of state pairs representing instances a→b for a general rule A→B. Also space-like
negentropic quantum entanglement is important piece of the story. For fermion Fock states
this gives Boolean rules as a special case. Zero energy states represent geometric memories,
simulations for time development whereas selves represent subjective memories and conscious
experience involves always the comparison of geometric and subjective memories telling whether
expectations were realized. Quantum theory of self-organization applies also to the evolution
of consciousness understood as self-organization in the ensemble of association sequences/selves
and implies Darwinian selection also at the level of selves and conscious experiences.
2. TGD Universe is quantum computer in a very general sense. Negentropic quantum entangle-
ment stabilizes qubits but makes them fuzzy.
This leads to a modiﬁcation of the standard
paradigm of quantum comptuation . Quantum computationalism is shown to reproduce the
relevant aspects of computationalism and connectionism without reducing conscious brain to a
deterministic machine. Holographic brain is also one of the dominating ideas of neuroscience.
TGD based realization of memory allows to reduce hologram idea to its essentials: what matters
is that piece of hologram is like a small window giving same information as larger window but in
less accurate form. This inspires the concept of neuronal window: each neuron has small window
to the perceptive landscape and is typically specialized to detect particular feature in the land-
scape. Coherent photons emitted by mindlike space-time sheets and propagating along axonal
microtubules serving as wave guides, realize neuronal windows quantum physically. Massless
extremals allow rather precise deﬁnition for the notion of quantum hologram.
A more reﬁned formulation of these ideas is based on the notion of conscious hologram. Many-
sheeted space-time is essentially a fractal Feynmann diagram with lines thicknened to 4-surfaces.
The lines are like wave guides carrying laser beams and vertices are like nodes where these laser
beams interfere and generate the points of the hologram. The 3-dimensionality of the ordinary
hologram generalizes to stereo consciousness resulting in the fusion of mental images associated
with various nodes of the conscious hologram. An essential element is the possibility of negative
energy space-time sheets analogous to the past directed lines of the Feynmann diagram: negative
energy MEs are the crucial element of sensory perception, motor action, and memory.
3. An important element is eﬀective four-dimensionality of brain making possible to understand
long term memories, planning and motor activities in a completely new manner. Further impor-
tant ideas are music metaphor already described and the vision about brain as an associative
net. Zero energy ontology and the notion of CD (causal diamond) provides justiﬁcation for the
memetic code and relates it to fundamental elementary particles time scales. The codewords
of the memetic code consist of sequences of 126 bits and are represented in terms of nerve
pulse sequences or membrane oscillations and time varying quark magnetization, is the key es-
sential element of brain as cognitive system. Codewords can be interpreted either as elements

1.4. The contents of the book
27
of a Boolean algebra or as bits in the binary expansion of an integer in the range (0, 2126) so
that memetic code makes brain able to assign numbers with qualia. An attractive and testable
identiﬁcation for the memetic codewords is as phonemes of language.
p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
TGD as a generalized number theory vision supports the interpretation of the p-adic physics in terms
of physical correlates of cognition and intentionality so that matter-mind dichotomy would correspond
to real–p-adic dichotomy at the level of the geometric correlates of mind. This interpretation has far
reaching implications for both TGD inspired theory of consciousness and for the general world view
provided by TGD. Cognition is predicted to be present in all length scales and the success of the
p-adic physics in elementary particle length scales forces to conclude that cognition and intention are
present even at this level.
The vision about life and conscious information and intelligence as something in the intersection
of real and p-adic worlds is the key guiding principle also in TGD inspired quantum biology. The
very fact that the notion of conscious information makes sense only in this intersection supports the
proposed interpretation of p-adic physics. Zero energy ontology and the notion of causal diamond
(CD) with zero energy states having interpretation as memes in very general sense is also of central
importance, and allows a quantitative formulation reducing the fundamental bio-rhythms to funda-
mental elementary particle time scales. The hierarchy of Planck constants as an explanation of dark
matter and energy as macroscopic quantum phases even in astrophysical scales and implying that
dark matter is a key actor in the drama of life is the third key element.
In this chapter the implications of this vision are studied from the point of view of cognitive
consciousness.
The basic ideas behind the proposed vision about intentionality and cognition are
following.
1. p-Adic space-time sheets are identiﬁed as the correlates of cognition and intention. The possibil-
ity to identify the inherent non-determinism of the p-adic ﬁeld equations as the non-determinism
of imagination makes this identiﬁcation attractive. Only the p-adic space-time sheets in the in-
tersection of real and p-adic worlds allow the transformation of intentions to actions and sensory
input to cognitions. Cognitions and intentions are related by time reversal in zero energ ontology.
The common algebraic points of real and p-adic partonic 2-surfaces in the algebraic extension
or rationals guaranteing that the representation of 2-surface makes sense both in real and p-adic
senses deﬁne fundamental cognitive representations as ﬁnite point sets.
2. The ’phase transition’ of a p-adic space-time sheet to a real space-time sheet taking place in
quantum jump between quantum histories corresponds to the transformation of a thought into
action or sensory experience (during dreams and hallucinations) whereas the reverse transfor-
mation corresponds to the transformation of the sensory input into cognition. This transition
can be thought to occur in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds where the mathematical
representations of partonic 2-surface make sense both in real and p-adic sense. Motor action
would correspond to the transformation of p-adic space-time sheets to their real counterparts
and during sensory experience the reversal of this transformation would take place. In zero
energy ontology these transformations could reduce to quark and lepton level as is suggested
by the fact that the time scales assignable to quarks and leptons correspond to 1 ms and .1 s
deﬁning fundamental time scales of nerve pulse activity and EEG.
3. The obvious question is how to test p-adic physics empirically.
First of all, thinking could
be interpreted as p-adic sensory experiencing. Hence the reduction of theories–experimental
science dichotomy to p-adic–real dichotomy seems natural: just like experimental science is
an extension of everyday real sensory experience, theories represent an extension of everyday
p-adic sensory experience (common sense thinking).
Thus the basic test is how well p-adic
physics based theories describe cognition.
Secondly, the p-adic models for physical systems
are strictly speaking models for cognitive models for real physics. The successes of these highly
predictive models (consider only p-adic elementary particle mass calculations involving only very
few integer valued parameters) supports the vision about p-adic physics as physics of cognition.
p-Adic–real phase transitions as models for how thought is transformed to action and sensory
input to thought provide a further testing ground for the new paradigm.

28
Chapter 1. Introduction
The following topics are discussed in the chapter.
1. The relationship between p-adic physics, intentionality, and cognition are discussed on gen-
eral level. Basic cognitive functions such as imagination, hallucinations, formation of cognitive
representations, Boolean mind, and learning are discussed in this conceptual framework.
2. Possible -necessarily indirect- evidence for p-adic cognition is considered.
3. In the mathematical sections the relationship between intentionality, cognition and number
theory is discussed. Also the relation between p-adic and real physics is discussed at general
level with basic vision being that the intersection of real and p-adic space-time sheets in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds consists of points belonging to the algebraic extension
of rational needed to guarantee that the mathematical representation of the partonic 2-surface
makes sense both in real and p-adic sense.
4. Frontal lobes are known to be the seat of the higher level intentional action and are discussed
from p-adic point of view.
5. A generalization of the memetic code to cognitive codes is discussed and some proposals about
codes are made. This generalization is based on p-adic length scale hypothesis. If the time scales
involved correspond to time scales assignable to the CDs of the known elementary particles, the
generalization is not favored. On the other hand, dark matter sector could allow entire fractal
hierarchy of elementary particle physics whose existence is reﬂected as fundamental bio-rhytms
and cognitive codes.
6. The intersection of real and p-adic partonic 2-surfaces deﬁning space-like cognitive representa-
tions consist of algebraic points. The hypothesis that these intersections obey various kind of
symmetries identiﬁable as molecular symmetries is discussed.
1.4.4
PART IV: PARANORMAL PHENOMENA
Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
The general quantum model for bio-systems leads to a model for bio-control which applies to a very
wide variety of hard-to-understand bio-chemical phenomena such as molecular recognition mecha-
nisms, water memory, and homeopathy and leads to a generalization of genetic code explaining the
mystery of introns. The same model generalizes to a model of paranormal phenomena such as psy-
chokinesis, remote sensing, remote healing, telepathy, communications with deceased, and instrumen-
tal transcommunications. The basic diﬀerence is that magnetic body receives information and controls
”foreign” biological (or even magnetic) body or ”dead” matter system.
The basic notions of the model are magnetic body as an intentional agent controlling biological
body and receiving data from living body or even ”dead” matter system with massless extremals (MEs)
mediating these communications, zero energy ontology and the related notion of causal diamond (CD)
serving as an imbedding space correlate of self and assigning to elementary particles fundamental
macroscopic time and length scales as those of CD, the hierarchy of Planck constants making possible
macroscopic quantum phases and zoom-ups of quantum systems, and the vision about living matter
as something residing in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and the closely related notion of
negentropic entanglement crucial for the functioning of living matter and conscious intelligence in
TGD Universe.
Negentropic entanglement, which can be both space-like and time-like in zero energy ontology,
makes possible quantum superposition of macroscopically diﬀerent conﬁgurations of the target system
correlated with the states of operator system. The operator should be able to achieve the negentropic
entanglement and intentionally increase the amplitude of the desired outcome in this superposition.
Negentropic entanglement need not involve binding energy and I have proposed this as a deeper level
explanation for the nebulous notion of high energy phosphate bond crucial for metabolism in living
matter. Quite generally, negentropic entanglement would make possible for the operator to transfer
metabolic energy and momentum to the target. The hierarchy of values of Planck constant would
make possible this process in long time and length scales.

1.4. The contents of the book

1. Magnetic mirrors (ME-magnetic ﬂux tube pairs) connecting the sender and receiver make pos-
sible a universal mechanism for the transfer of intent and action. The pair of ﬂux tubes forms
a kind of sensory-motor loop.
In biology the fundamental realization could be by a pair of
ﬂux sheets going through the strands of DNA with passive strand sending sensory data to the
magnetic body and active strand receiving control commands leading to various forms of gene
expresion. MEs are ideal for the transfer of both classical information and momentum.
2. p-Adic MEs represent the transfer of a mere intent and real MEs represent a transfer of action.
p-Adic ME can be transformed to real ME either by receiver or some higher level magnetic self.
This makes sense only in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
3. The transfer of intent gives rise to mechanism of remote interaction which can act both endo-
and exogenously. Magnetic mirrors characterized by their fundamental frequencies make possi-
ble bridges between sender and receiver (say healer and healee) and allow a resonant interaction
in which healer can initiate various control commands acting as 4-dimensional templates repre-
sented as holograms. Also smaller MEs can be send along the MEs serving as bridges (this is
like throwing balls with light velocity!).
4. The ME-magnetic ﬂux tube pair connecting sender and receiver can act as a reference wave
which can initiate an arbitrarily complex hologram representing biological program.
Sender
has the ability to generate and amplify the frequencies which induce holograms representing
the control commands. In particular, in living matter sender can initiate complex biological
programs without knowing anything about their functioning.
One can distinguish between psychokinesis applied to living matter and ”dead” matter.
1. When the target consists of living matter the mechanisms would be same as in communications
between magnetic and biological bodies making possible bio-control of biological body by mag-
netic body and the receival of sensory input from biological body by magnetic body. Hypnosis
would be one example of this kind of interaction.
2. Remote mental interactions in the case ”dead” could use simpler variants of the fundamental
mechanisms utilized in living matter. For instance, zero energy ontology assigns with the CDs
of electron and quarks time scales .1 s and 1 ms deﬁning fundamental biorhythms. The CDs
assignable to elementary particles could be involved also with psychokinesis. Negentropic en-
tanglement could be essential for the transfer of metabolic energy (say in simple psychokinesis
moving an object) and for control actions -say in intentional change of sequences of binary dig-
its produced by random number generator. Target system would not be completely ”dead”.
Thermodynamical restrictions favor large values of Planck constant.
The basic problem in many remote mental interactions such as the intentional eﬀect on random
number generator is ”Who knows how?”. How the mere intent can be transformed to action without
any knowledge about the details of the action? The attempt to understand how neuro-feedback aﬀect
the behavior of single neuron leads to the same question.
1. Magnetic mirrors make possible also feedback and this feedback could make possible learning.
For instance, in psychokinesis (especially so in micro PK), this learning would be crucial and
analogous to that what occurs when we learn to drive a car. In healing this kind of feedback
might help to ﬁnd the healing frequency by trial and error.
2. It is quite possible that also multibrained and -bodied higher level colletive selves actively par-
ticipate in the process as a third party such that the remote mental interactions would act as
a relay states. I have suggested similar explanation for Sheldrake’s ﬁndings about learning at
the lelel of species and Tiller’s ﬁndings about the ”transfer of intent”. This could make possi-
ble coherent ampliﬁcation eﬀects (TEM, prayer groups) and could make available information
resources of all brains involved with the group. This could for instance explain the ability of a
remote viewer to see an object on basis of data which need not have any meaning for her.
3. A fast amplitude modulation of alpha waves introducing higher harmonics to the carrier wave
is a good candidate for mediating communication between brains and higher level multibrained

30
Chapter 1. Introduction
selves. Mesoscopic ’features’ in brain involve precisely this kind of amplitude modulation and
might represent just this kind of messages.
Interestingly, also speech is produced by a fast
amplitude modulation of 10 Hz basic vibration frequency of speech organs (assignable to electron
CD as a fundamental frequency) and kHz (quarks) frequency is a special frequency from the
point of view of hearing.
TGD Based Model for OBEs
Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) are often understood as experience of seeing oneself from a position
outside of the body.
OBEs are poorly understood in the framework of neuro science and pose a
challenge for the reductionistic world view.
In TGD framework the notion of magnetic body provides an attractive starting point in attempts
to understand what OBEs and related experiences are. The basic idea is that magnetic body serves
eﬀectively as a mirror deﬁning a third person view as a cognitive representation also in ordinary wake-
up state and that during OBEs this representation becomes sensory representation. Magnetic body
need not always be a personal magnetic body but could correspond to a magnetic body receiving
information from several brains (collective consciousness), magnetic body of another person, or be
even associated with ”dead” matter.
The progress in identifying dark matter as a phase of matter with large value of Planck constant
making possible macroscopic quantum coherence has led to the vision about dark matter at magnetic
ﬂux quanta as quantum controller of ordinary matter in living systems. The Bose-Einstein condensates
of dark photons decaying via decoherence to ordinary photons mediate interactions between ordinary
and dark matter and the hypothesis is that dark photon ”laser” beams from body and brain reﬂected
at magnetic ﬂux quanta give rise to third person aspect of consciousness which in OBEs and related
experiences are realized as sensory representations. The identiﬁcation of bio-photons as end products
of the de-coherence of dark photon beams is natural.
Zero energy ontology and the notion of causal diamond (or CD deﬁned roughly as the intersection
of future and past directed lightcones) brings additional quantitative ingredients to the model. Sub-
CDs deﬁne imbedding space (M 4 × CP2) correlates for selves and by holography the 2-D partonic
2-surfaces at the light-like future and past boundaries of CDs are the ultimate space-time correlates
for mental images. The moduli space for CDs makes possible a more detailed view about sensory
representations.
A further new element is the vision about life as something in the intersection of real and p-adic
worlds. The most important outcome is that the notion of number theoretic entanglement negentropy
making sense in this situation is positive so that entanglement carries conscious information. The
fusion of selves (in particular mental image) by negentropic entanglement is experienced as expansion
of consciousness. It is negentropic entanglement between parts of biological body and corresponding
parts of the magnetic body and biological body which makes living system living. This negentropic
entanglement between magnetic body and biological body is important also for OBEs.
The model leads also to a model for dreams, hallucinations, sensory feedback from brain to sensory
organs, and directed attention. Concrete models for how dark photons can give rise to experiences in
various sensory modalities such as vision, hearing, olfaction, and tactile senses, are proposed.

2.1
Introduction
Topological Geometro-Dynamics (TGD) is a uniﬁed theory of fundamental interactions. TGD in-
volves a quite far-reaching generalization of the space-time concept and, apart from the notion of
quantum jump, reduces quantum theory to inﬁnite-dimensional geometry. Quantum TGD requires
the introduction of several new mathematical tools and concepts, in particular p-adic numbers.
TGD based theory of consciousness has developed gradually during the last ﬁfteen years side by
side with TGD based quantum measurement theory. For a summary of TGD and p-adic aspects of
TGD see [K88, K48] .
The emergence of the notions of zero energy ontology and hierarchy of Planck constants together
with the increased understanding of the special features of number theoretical universality have led to
a considerable deepening of the understanding during last half decade. The basic concepts and ideas
of TGD based theory of consciousness as I would have formulated them around 2005 are introduced
ﬁrst. After that the ideas that have appeared during the period 2005-2010 are brieﬂy summarized.
2.1.1
Basic ideas of TGD inspired theory of consciousness
In the following basic ideas of TGD inspired theory of consciousness as they were formulate for about
half decade ago are summarized.
Identiﬁcation of quantum states as quantum histories and the notion of quantum jump
General coordinate invariance forces the identiﬁcation of the quantum states as quantum histories
rather than time=constant snapshots of single quantum history. Quantum history can be regarded as
a classical spinor ﬁeld in the world of all classical worlds (WCW) so that rather abstract concept is
in question. This identiﬁcation has several important consequences.
1. The possibility to regard unitary process followed by state function collapse as a quantum jump
between quantum histories solves the basic paradox posed by the determinism of the Schr¨odinger
equation contra non-determinism of the state function collapse.
2. A radical reconsideration of the concepts of psychological time and observer becomes necessary
and forces a profound generalization of the standard views about time.
If quantum jump occurs between two diﬀerent time evolutions of Schr¨odinger equation (understood
here in very metaphoral sense) rather than interfering with single deterministic Schr¨odinger evolution,
the basic problem of quantum measurement theory ﬁnds a resolution. The interpretation of quantum
jump as a moment of consciousness means that volition and conscious experience are outside space-
time and state space and that quantum states and space-time surfaces are ”zombies”. Quantum jump
would have actually a complex anatomy corresponding to unitary process U, state function reduction
and state preparation at least.
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) codes for the dynamics of standard state function
reduction and states that the state function reduction process following U-process gives rise to maximal
33

34
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
reduction of entanglement entropy at each step. In the generic case this implies decomposition of the
system to unique unentangled systems and the process repeats itself for these systems. The process
stops when the resulting subsystem cannot be decomposed to a pair of free systems since energy
conservation makes the reduction of entanglement kinematically impossible in the case of bound
states.
The notion of self
Intuitively self corresponds to a sequence of quantum jumps which somehow integrates to a larger unit
much like many-particle bound state is formed from more elementary building blocks. It also seems
natural to assume that self stays conscious as long as it can avoid bound state entanglement with the
environment in which case the reduction of entanglement is energetically impossible. One could say
that everything is conscious and consciousness can be only lost when the system forms bound state
entanglement with environment.
As will be found, there is an important exception to this vision based on ordinary Shannon entropy.
There exists an inﬁnite hierarchy of number theoretical entropies making sense for rational or even
algebraic entanglement probabilities. In this case the entanglement negentropy can be negative so that
NMP favors the generation of negentropic entanglement, which need not be bound state entanglement
in standard sense.
Self is assumed to experience sub-selves as mental images identiﬁable as ”averages” of their mental
images. This implies the notion of ageing of mental images as being due to the growth of ensemble
entropy as the ensemble consisting of quantum jumps (sub-sub-subselves) increases.
One of the newest ideas related to the notion of self is that the sub-selves of two unentangled
selves can entangle although selves remain unentangled. This is possible by the modiﬁcation of the
subsystem concept forced by the p-adic length scale cutoﬀ. The entanglement of sub-selves means
fusion and sharing of mental images providing a universal telepathy like quantum communication
mechanism and presumably making possible both molecular, cellular, and human societies.
Generalization of quantum measurement theory
One must reformulate quantum measurement theory. The hypothesis that each quantum jump in-
volves localization in the so called zero modes having interpretation as classical variables characterizing
the observable geometric properties of the space-time surface, and thus of external macroscopic ob-
server, together with an additional condition guaranteing that the density matrix characterizing the
entanglement between quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom and zero modes is diagonal, implies
standard quantum measurement theory. Needless to emphasize, the reduction of the standard quan-
tum measurement theory to fundamental quantum physics is a triumph of TGD approach.
This is however not the whole story. The standard quantum measurement is followed by a cascade
self measurements inside self, which reduces entanglement between some subsystem and its comple-
ment in quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom: again a measurement of the density matrix is in
question. This cascade is equivalent with the process of state preparation which is a phenomenological
notion in the standard quantum measurement theory. The dynamics of self measurement is governed
by Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP), which speciﬁes which subsystems are subject to quan-
tum measurement in a given quantum jump. NMP can be regarded as a basic law for the dynamics
of quantum jumps and states that the information content of the conscious experience is maximized.
In p-adic context NMP dictates the dynamics of cognition.
Quantum criticality
The systems possessing self correspond to macroscopic quantum phases. In standard physics context
the existence of the required macroscopic quantum phases is not at all obvious whereas the new
physics implied by TGD predicts their existence. The point is that the Universe according to TGD is
a quantum critical system. Quantum criticality is mathematically very similar to thermodynamical
criticality and implies long range quantum correlations in all length scales.
This in turn implies
the existence of macroscopic quantum phases. TGD Universe is also quantum spin glass with state
degeneracy broken only by the classical gravitational energy of the space-time sheets having same
induced K¨ahler ﬁeld. This degeneracy makes it possible to have quantum coherence over time periods

2.1. Introduction
35
longer than CP2 time of order 10−39 seconds characterizing the duration of single quantum jump so
that biosystems can act as quantum computers in macroscopic time scales.
TGD based space-time concept and the existence of macroscopic quantum phases
TGD implies a radical generalization of the space-time concept in all length and time scales. The
concept of many-sheeted space-time leads to fresh proposals for how biosystems manage to be macro-
scopic quantum systems. Examples of these mechanisms are so called wormhole superconductivity,
electronic high Tc super-conductivity, neutrino super-conductivity, ionic and a mechanism for gener-
ating coherent light and gravitons [K10, K11, K11, K55] . The notion of many-sheeted ionic equi-
librium summarizes the basic vision about quantum control and coordination according to which the
space-time sheets associated with the superconducting magnetic ﬂux tube structures control ordinary
biomatter at the atomic space-time sheets.
The so called massless exremals (MEs), which can be regarded as ’topological light rays’, are
carriers of especially important exmple of macroscopic quantum states. The lightlike boundaries of
MEs act as quantum holograms and carry representations of the superconformal and super-symplectic
algebras. These states have gigantic almost-degeneracies, and are genuine quantum gravitational states
(state functionals in the conﬁguration space of 3-surfaces, ’the world of worlds’) and thus correspond
to higher abstraction level than ordinary quantum states.
MEs can control the supercurrents at
superconducting magnetic ﬂux tube structures by magnetic interactions, act as Josephson junctions,
and induce magnetic quantum phase transitions. Therefore the quantum holograms associated with
MEs are excellent candidates for quantum correlates of higher level consciousness.
p-Adic numbers and consciousness
p-Adic number ﬁelds Rp (one number ﬁeld for each prime p = 2, 3, 5, ...) are analogous to real numbers
but diﬀer from them in that p-adic numbers are not well-ordered. p-Adic numbers play an absolutely
essential role in the formulation of quantum TGD and of TGD inspired theory of consciousness.
The inherent non-determinism of p-adic diﬀerential equations motivates the identiﬁcation of the p-
adic space-time sheets as cognitive representations of ordinary matter with p-adic non-determinism
identiﬁed as non-determinism of imagination. Mind-matter duality is realized at the level of space-
time geometry and mind stuﬀcorresponds to p-adic regions of space-time. TGD Universe performs
self mimicry in all length scales. Besides p-adic nondeterminism there is nondeterminism of K¨ahler
action: these two nondeterminisms allow to represent some aspects of quantum jump sequences, that
is contents of consciousness of selves, at space-time level cognitively and symbolically (language). This
in turn makes possible self referentiality of consciousness: it is possible to become conscious about
being conscious about...
2.1.2
Implications of zero energy ontology, number theoretical universal-
ity, and hierarchy of Planck constants
Zero energy ontology, number theoretical universality, and hierarchy of Planck constants represent
ideas, which have developed strongly during last half decade and have led to to a considerable re-
ﬁnement of the overall view about consciousness and inspired also a vision about life as something
residing in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds [K44] .
Zero energy ontology and the notions of quantum jump and self
Zero energy ontology changes considerably the interpretation of the unitary process and state function
reduction. In zero energy ontology quantum states are replaced with zero energy states deﬁned as
superpositions of pairs of positive and negative energy states identiﬁed as counterparts of initial and
ﬁnal states of a physical event such as particle scattering. Zero energy ontology is ideal from the
point of view of consciousness and intentionality. Everything can be in principle be created from
vacuum so that several frustrating paradoxes plaguing positive energy ontology disappear. Also the
quantum jumps between p-adic and real quantum states suggested to correspond to intentional action
are mathematically sensible in zero energy ontology.
The matrix deﬁning entanglement between positive and negative - christened as M-matrix- is the
counterpart of the ordinary S-matrix but need not be unitary. It can be identiﬁed as a ”complex square

36
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
root” of density matrix expressible as a product of positive square root of diagonal density matrix and
unitary S-matrix. Quantum TGD can be seen as deﬁning a ”square root” of thermodynamics, which
thus becomes an essential part of quantum theory.
U-matrix is deﬁned between zero energy states and cannnot therefore be equated with the S-
matrix used to describe particle scattering events. Unitary conditions however imply that U-matrix
can be seen as a collection of M-matrices labelled by zero energy states so that the knowledge of
U-matrix implies the knowledge of M-matrices.
A natural guess is that U is directly related to
consciousness and the description of intentional actions. For positive energy ontology state function
reduction would serve as a state preparation for the next quantum jump. In zero energy ontology
state function preparation and reduction can be assigned to the positive and negative energy states
deﬁning the initial and ﬁnal states of the physical event. The reduction of the time-like entanglement
during the state function reduction process corresponds to the measurement of the scattering matrix.
In the case of negentropic time-like entanglement the reduction process is not random anymore and
the resulting dynamics is analogous to that of cellular automata providing a natural description of
the dynamics of self-organization in living matter.
Zero energy ontology leads to a precise identiﬁcation of the subsystem at space-time level. General
coordinate invariance in 4-D sense means that 3-surfaces related by 4-D diﬀeomorphisms are physically
equivalent.
It is conventient to perform a gauge ﬁxing by a introducing a natural choice for the
representatives of the equivalence classes formed by diﬀeo-related 3-surfaces.
1. Light-like 3-surfaces identiﬁed as surfaces at which the Minkowskian signature of the induced
space-time metric changes to Euclidian one - wormhole contacts- are excellent candidates in this
respect. The intersections of these surfaces with the light-like boundaries of CD deﬁned 2-D
partonic surfaces. Also the 3-D space-like ends of space-time sheets at the light-like boundaries
of CDs are very natural candidates for preferred 3-surfaces.
2. The condition that the choices are mutually consistent implies eﬀective 2-dimensionality. The
intersections of these surfaces deﬁning partonic 2-surface plus the distribution of 4-D tangent
spaces at its points deﬁne the basic dynamical objects with 4-D general coordinate invariance
reduced to 2-dimensional one. This eﬀective 2-dimensionality was clear from the very beginning
but is only apparent since also the data about 4-D tangent space distribution is necessary to
characterize the geometry of WCW and quantum states.
The descriptions in terms of 3-D
light-like or space-like surfaces and even in terms of 4-D surfaces are equivalent but redundant
descriptions. This has far reaching implications for the concrete mathematical realization of
number theoretic universality [K44] .
As far as consciousness is considered eﬀective 2-dimensionality means holography and could relate
to the fact that at least our visual experience is at least eﬀectively 2-dimensional.
Positive entanglement negentropy is possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worls
Positive entanglement negentropy is possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and is
stable against NMP. Giving up the original ad hoc interpretation as a counterpart for bound state
entanglement leads to a beautiful vision about the role of negentropic entanglement in cognition and
functioning of living matter.
1. The ﬁrst form of NMP was rather naive. There was no idea about the anatomy of quantum
jump and NMP only stated that the allowed quantum jumps are such that the information
gain of conscious experience measured by the reduction of entanglement entropy resulting in the
reduction of entanglement between the subsystem of system and its complement is maximal.
Later it became clear that quantum jump has a complex anatomy consisting of unitary process
U followed by the TGD counterpart of state function reduction serving as a state preparation
for the next quantum jump.
2. The attempts to formulate NMP in p-adic physics led to the realization that one can distinguish
between three kinds of information measures.
(a) In real physics the negative of the entanglement entropy deﬁned by the standard Shannon
formula deﬁnes a natural information measure, which is always non-positive.

2.1. Introduction
37
(b) In p-adic physics one can generalize this information measure to p-adic valued information
measure by replacing the logarithms of p-adic valued probabilities with the p-based loga-
rithms logp(|P|p) which are integer valued and can be interpreted as p-adic numbers. This
p-adic valued entanglement entropy can be mapped to a non-negative real number by the
so called canonical identiﬁcation x = P
n xnpn →P
n xnp−n. In both cases a non-positive
information measure results.
(c) When the entanglement probabilities are rational numbers or at most ﬁnitely algebraically
extended rational numbers one can still deﬁne logarithms of probabilities as p-based loga-
rithms logp(|P|p) and interpret the entropy as a rational or algebraic number. In this case
the entropy can be however negative and positive deﬁnite information measure is possible.
Irrespective of number ﬁeld one can in this case deﬁne entanglement entropy as a maximum
of number theoretic entropies Sp over the set of primes. The ﬁrst proposal was that the
algebraic entanglement corresponds to bound state entanglement turned out to be wrong.
3. At some stage the importance of the almost trivial fact that bound state entanglement must
be kinematically stable against NMP became obvious. One can imagine that the state function
reduction proceeds step by step by reducing the state to two parts in such a manner that the
reduction of entanglement entropy is maximal.
(a) If a resulting subsystem corresponds to a bound state having no decomposition to free
subsystems the process stops for this subsystem. The natural assumption is that subsystems
lose their consciousness when U process leads to bound state entanglement whereas bound
state itself can be conscious.
(b) If the entanglement is negentropic (and thus rational or algebraic) a more natural inter-
pretation consistent with the teaching of spiritual practices is that subsystems experience
a fusion to a larger conscious entity. The negentropic entanglement between free states is
stabilized by NMP and negentropically entangled states need not reside at the bottom of
potential well forbidding the reduction of entanglement. This makes possible new kinds
of correlated states for which binding energy can be negative. Bound state entanglement
would be like the jail of organized marriage and negentropic entanglement like a love mar-
riage in which companions are free to leave but do not what it. The existence of this kind of
negentropic entanglement is especially interesting in living matter, where metabolism (high
energy phosphate bond in particular) and the stability of DNA and other highly charged
polymers is poorly understood physically: negentropic entanglement could be responsible
for stabilization making possible the transfer of metabolic energy [K26] .
4. For the negentropic entanglement the outcome of the state function reduction ceases to be
random as it is for the standard deﬁnition of entanglement entropy. Note however that U process
as a creative act yielding superposition of possibibilities from which state function reduction
selects leaves means non-determinism.
This has far reaching consequences.
Ordinary state
function reductions for an ensemble of systems lead to a generation of thermodynamical entropy
and this explains the second law of thermodynamics. In the case of negentropic entanglement
situation changes and the predicted breaking of second law of thermodynamics provides a new
view to understand self-organization [K69] , and living matter could be identiﬁed as something
residing in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds where p-adic intentions can be transformed
to real actions.
5. One particular choice involved with state function reduction process could be the choice be-
tween generic entanglement and number theoretic entanglement possible only in the intersection
of p-adic and real WCWs. If the choice is the generic entanglement, system ends up either to
an unentangled state with maximal conscious freedom or to a bound state with a loss of con-
sciousness. If the choice is algebraic entanglement, system ends up to negentropic entanglement
and correlations with external world and experiences an expansion of consciousness. Maybe
ethical choices are basically choices between these two options.
Also positive emotions like
love and experience of understanding could directly relate to various aspects of the negentropic
entanglement.

Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
Dark matter hierarchy
Basic objection against quantum theories of consciousness and biology relate to the smallness of Planck
constant making diﬃcult to imagine macroscopic quantum coherence in the scales of living matter.
Zero energy ontology partially resolves the problem by assigning to elementary particles macroscopic
length and time scales. For instance, the time scale assignable to the CD of electron is .1 seconds
deﬁning the fundamental bio-rhythm.
The anomalies related to the interaction of ELF em ﬁelds on living matter and Nottale’s observation
that planetary orbits correspond approximately to Bohr orbits with a gigantic value of Planck constant
led to the hypothesis that Planck constant has a discrete spectrum and can have arbitrarily large
values [K73, K21] . The identiﬁcation of dark matter as phases having large value of Planck constant
[K73, K24, K20] led to a vigorous evolution of ideas. Entire dark matter hierarchy with levels labelled
by increasing values of Planck constant is predicted, and in principle TGD predicts the values of
Planck constant if physics as a generalized number theory vision is accepted [K24] .
The hierarchy of Planck constants is realized in terms of a generalization of the causal diamond
CD × CP2, where CD is deﬁned as an intersection of the future and past directed light-cones of 4-D
Minkowski space M 4. CD × CP2 is generalized by gluing singular coverings and factor spaces of both
CD and CP2 together like pages of book along common back, which is 2-D sub-manifold which is M 2
for CD and homologically trivial geodesic sphere S2 for CP2 [K24] . The value of the Planck constant
characterizes partially the given page and arbitrary large values of ℏare predicted so that macroscopic
quantum phases are possible since the fundamental quantum scales scale like ℏ. The most general
spectrum comes in rational multiples of standard value of Planck constant which corresponds to the
unit of rationals. For CDs the scaling of Planck constants means scaling of the size of CD. This could
explain why the rational multiples of the fundamental frequency are so special for music experience.
All particles in the vertices of Feynman diagrams have the same value of Planck constant so that
particles at diﬀerent pages cannot have local interactions. Thus one can speak about relative darkness
in the sense that only the interactions mediated by the exchange of particles and by classical ﬁelds
are possible between diﬀerent pages. Dark matter in this sense can be observed, say through the
classical gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. It is in principle possible to photograph dark
matter by the exchange of photons which leak to another page of book, reﬂect, and leak back. This
leakage corresponds to ℏchanging phase transition occurring at quantum criticality and living matter
is expected carry out these phase transitions routinely in bio-control. This picture leads to no obvious
contradictions with what is really known about dark matter and to my opinion the basic diﬃculty
in understanding of dark matter (and living matter) is the blind belief in standard quantum theory.
These observations motivate the tentative identiﬁcation of the macroscopic quantum phases in terms
of dark matter and also of dark energy with gigantic ”gravitational” Planck constant.
It seems safe to conclude that the dark matter hierarchy with levels labelled by the values of
Planck constants explains the macroscopic and macro-temporal quantum coherence naturally. That
this explanation is consistent with the explanation based on spin glass degeneracy is suggested by
the following observations. First, the argument supporting spin glass degeneracy as an explanation
of the macro-temporal quantum coherence does not involve the value of ℏat all.
Secondly, the
failure of the perturbation theory assumed to lead to the increase of Planck constant and formation of
macroscopic quantum phases could be precisely due to the emergence of a large number of new degrees
of freedom due to spin glass degeneracy. Thirdly, the phase transition increasing Planck constant has
concrete topological interpretation in terms of many-sheeted space-time consistent with the spin glass
degeneracy.
At least dark matter could be a key player in quantum biology.
1. Dark matter hierarchy and p-adic length scale hierarchy would provide a quantitative formulation
for the self hierarchy. To a given p-adic length scale one can assign a secondary p-adic time scale
as the temporal distance between the tips of the CD. For electron this time scale is .1 second,
the fundamental bio-rhythm. For a given p-adic length scale dark matter hierarchy gives rise to
additional time scales coming as ℏ/ℏ0 multiples of this time scale.
2. The predicted breaking of second law of thermodynamics chacterizing living matter - if identiﬁed
as something in the intersection of real and p-adic words - would be always below the time scale
of CD considered but would take place in arbitrary long time scales at appropriate levels of the
hierarchy. The scaling up of ℏalso scales up the time scale for the breaking of the second law.

2.2. TGD inspired theory of consciousness

3. The hypothesis that magnetic body is the carrier of dark matter in large ℏphase has led to
models for EEG predicting correctly the band structure and even individual resonance bands
and also generalizing the notion of [J27] [K21] . Also a generalization of the notion of genetic
code emerges resolving the paradoxes related to the standard dogma [K40, K21] . A particularly
fascinating implication is the possibility to identify great leaps in evolution as phase transitions
in which new higher level of dark matter emerges [K21] .
If one accepts the hierarchy of Planck constants [K24] , it might be un-necessary to distinguish
between self and quantum jump. The hierarchy of Planck constants interpreted in terms of dark matter
hierarchy predicts a hierarchy of quantum jumps such that the size of space-time region contributing
to the contents of conscious experience scales like ℏ. Also the hierarchy of space-time sheets labeled
by p-adic primes suggests the same. That sequence of sub-selves/sub-quantum jumps are experienced
as separate mental images explains why we can distinguish between digits of phone number. The
irreducible component of self (pure awareness) would correspond to the highest level in the ”personal”
hierarchy of quantum jumps and the sequence of lower level quantum jumps would be responsible
for the experience of time ﬂow. Entire life cycle could correspond to single quantum jump at the
highest(?) level of the personal self hierarchy and pure awareness would prevail during sleep: this
would make it possible to experience directly that I existed yesterday.
There are thus two deﬁnitions of self. The ﬁrst deﬁnition introduces self as a notion separate from
quantum jump. Second deﬁnition reduces the notion of self to a fractal hierarchy of quantum jumps.
The equivalence between two deﬁnitions of the notion of self will be proposed.
2.2
TGD inspired theory of consciousness
Before continuing some comments about the deﬁnition of quantum history concept are in order. In
TGD quantum states corresponds to Diﬀ4 invariant conﬁguration space spinor ﬁelds deﬁned in the
space of 3-surfaces. By general coordinate invariance the value of the conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld
is same for all 3-surfaces X3 ⊂X4(Y 3) related by diﬀomorphisms, especially by time translations
of X4(Y 3). This means that conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld cannot be localized temporally unless
X4(Y 3) has ﬁnite time duration and is therefore vacuum 4-surface.
Hence it is natural to speak
of quantum history. Note that ’quantum history’ in this sense does not refer to Schr¨odinger time
evolution (since the Schr¨odinger evolution operator is generalized by TGD) nor evolution by quantum
jumps (since, in TGD, these are jumps between entire quantum histories) but is quantum history with
respect to the geometric time of X4(Y 3) and determined by the requirement of general coordinate
invariance.
Quantum history is deﬁned in the world of all possible clasical worlds (3-surfaces or
equivalently allowed space-time surfaces).
Quantum histories can be also regarded as superpositions of classical space-time surfaces since
the deﬁnition of the conﬁguration space geometry assigns to each 3-surface Y 3 a unique space-time
surface X4(Y 3) and since conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld is invariant under general coordinate trans-
formations. As a consequence, classical TGD becomes an exact part of quantum TGD.
2.2.1
Quantum jumps between quantum histories as moments of con-
sciousness
The individual quantum jump between quantum histories has a complex anatomy which has become
obvious only gradually. Quantum jump consists of the unitary, informational ”time evolution”
Ψi →UΨi
of the initial quantum history Ψi described by the unitary operator U (essentially S-matrix), followed
by the step
UΨi →Ψf0 ,
in which a localization in zero modes occurs.
This step is the counterpart of the state function
reduction process and gives rise to the ordinary quantum measurement with zero modes playing the
role of classical variables.

40
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
This step is followed by a sequence of self measurements
Ψf0 →Ψf1 →....Ψf
leading to a state Ψf in which only bound state entanglement remains. This process is the counterpart
of state function reduction for quantum jump in question and of state preparation for the next quan-
tum jump. In a given self measurement sub-system decomposes into two unentangled parts and the
decomposition is ﬁxed by the requirement that the reduction of the entanglement entropy is maximal
(Negentropy Maximization Principle) and the density matrix serves as a universal observable in the
self measurement.
It should be emphasized that the operator U is only the formal counterpart of the Schr¨odinger time
evolution lasting inﬁnite time: there is no actual Schr¨odinger equation involved and U has nothing to
do with geometric time development1.
The developments taken place in TGD during period 2005-2010 tend to modify slightly this picture.
1. The original belief was that U codes all the statistical predictions of quantum TGD and is the
counterpart of S-matrix of quantum ﬁeld theories. The introduction of zero energy ontology
however led to conclusion that so called M-deﬁning the time-like entanglement coeﬃcients be-
tween positive and negative energy parts of zero energy states is the counterpart of S-matrix of
physicists measured in laboratory and can be regarded as a product of ”complex” square root
of density matrix expressible as positive diagonal square root of density matrix and unitary S-
matrix. In this framework U-matrix is between zero energy states whereas M-matrix is between
positive and negative energy parts of zero energy states. It turns out that U-matrix can be
regarded as a collection of M-matrices labelled by zero energy states and that unitarity condi-
tions state that these M-matrices deﬁne an orthonormal state basis [K44] . Therefore U-matrix
codes for all predictions of quantum TGD. In zero energy ontology U-matrix can have matrix
elements also between diﬀerent number ﬁelds in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds in
which the mathematical representation of the partonic 2-surfaces makes sense in both real and
p-adic worlds sense. This makes the mathematical description of intentional action as a leakage
from p-adic world to real world possible.
2. Second deviation from the original picture comes from the possibility negentropic entanglement
when entanglement probabilities are rational or even algebraic numbers. Negentropic entangle-
ment can be also stable against NMP so that both bound state entanglement or negentropic
entanglement for all subsystem pairs of system means that the reduction cascade stops. There
is no need to identify these entanglements and an attractive hypothesis is that consciousness
is lost only in the generation of bound state entanglement whereas the generation of the ne-
gentropic entanglement corresponds to an experience about expansion of consciousness. It is
natural to assign positive emotions like love and experience of understanding to various forms
of the negentropic entanglement. Both negentropic entanglement and intentional action would
be possible only in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds, which suggest that life could be
seen as a critical phenomenon in number theoretical sense.
Subjective time development understood as a sequence of quantum jumps occurs outside the realm
of the geometric space-time. It could be regarded as a non-deterministic hopping in the space of the
conﬁguration space spinor ﬁelds. Individual quantum jump is however fundamentally irreducible in the
sense that one cannot model it by any dynamical time development. The identiﬁcation of quantum
jump as a moment of consciousness deﬁnes what might be called microscopic theory of conscious-
ness. The subjective time development presumably obeys some variational principle consistent with
the quantum measurement theory, in particular, with its non-determinism2. This principle dictates
which systems for given initial quantum history can perform quantum jumps and have moments of
consciousness. This variational principle will be discussed in section [2.2.2].
1From TGD point of view the identiﬁcation of the geometric time and the time coordinate appearing in the general
Schr¨odinger equation of quantum ﬁeld theories quantized using Hamiltonian formalism is wrong. Schr¨odinger equation
is not even needed. The identiﬁcation of the time coordinate of the Dirac equation as a geometric time however makes
sense from TGD point of view.
2This means that the variational principle in question must be more akin to the second law of thermodynamics
rather than to the ordinary variational principles of physics.

How the world of conscious experience can look classical?
If quantum histories (/states) are quantum superpositions over a huge number of classical space-time
surfaces, it is very diﬃcult to understand how the world of conscious experience manages to look
classical. The solution of the problem comes out from the requirement that quantum jumps in a well
deﬁned sense reduce to quantum measurements performed in a space-time with a ﬁxed macroscopic
geometry as in quantum ﬁeld theory. The macroscopic aspects of the space-time surface are determined
completely by the zero modes of the conﬁguration space characterizing the induced K¨ahler ﬁeld and
geometric size and shape of the four-surface totally. Thus, if each quantum measurement involves a
localization in zero modes, then the classicality of the universe of subjective experience is achieved
automatically, and as noticed, standard quantum measurement theory follows from quantum TGD
proper. In p-adic space-time degrees of freedom complete localization must occur in every quantum
jump for purely mathematical reasons, and the interpretation is that intentionality and cognition are
completely classical.
During macrotemporal quantum coherence due to the formation of bound state half of the zero
modes of two space-time sheets connected by join along boundaries bonds become macroscopic quan-
tum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom, and in these states consciously experienced world looks non-
classical. These states correspond to states of ”one-ness” at the level of conscious experience.
There are counter arguments against complete localization. First of all, one can imagine that
the reduction could occur to a sub-space of zero modes consisting of a discrete points.
Rational
bound state entanglement in discrete sub-spaces of zero modes would be stable against state function
reduction. Even more generally, the existence of symplectic structure in zero modes allows to consider
a hierarchy of 2n-dimensional sub-manifolds in the space of zero modes with volume element deﬁned
by the n:th power of the symplectic form. State function reduction could occur to this kind of sub-
manifold since at least the transition amplitude would be well-deﬁned. Preferred sub-manifolds of this
kind are sub-manifolds closed with respect to the action of SO(3) × SU(3) isometries such that only
the coordinates associated with a ﬁnite number of super-symplectic generators are non-constant.
Standard quantum measurement theory
The assumption that a complete localization occurs in zero modes in each quantum jump implies
that the world of conscious experience looks classical. It also implies standard quantum measurement
theory without NMP as the following arguments demonstrate.
1. The standard quantum measurement theory a la von Neumann involves the interaction of brain
with the measurement apparatus. If this interaction corresponds to entanglement between mi-
croscopic degrees of freedom m with the macroscopic eﬀectively classical degrees of freedom
M characterizing the reading of the measurement apparatus coded to brain state, then the
reduction of this entanglement in quantum jump reproduces standard quantum measurement
theory.
2. Since zero modes represent classical information about the geometry of space-time surface
(shape, size, classical K¨ahler ﬁeld,...), they have interpretation as eﬀectively classical degrees
of freedom and are the TGD counterpart of the degrees of freedom M representing the reading
of the measurement apparatus. The entanglement between quantum ﬂuctuating non-zero modes
and zero modes is the TGD counterpart for the m−M entanglement. Therefore the localization
in zero modes is equivalent with a quantum jump leading to a ﬁnal state where the measurement
apparatus gives a deﬁnite reading.
3. Unitarity is consistent with the localization in zero modes if the unitary time evolution operator
U acts eﬀectively as a ﬂow in zero mode degrees.
This means that in some incoming state
basis |n, z⟩, where z refers to zero modes, the outgoing states are of form S†
nm|m, z1(z, n)⟩. The
eﬀective ﬂow property means a 1-1 mapping of the outgoing quantum state basis to classical
variables (say, spin direction of the electron to its orbit in the external magnetic ﬁeld). The
ﬁnal state is an eigenstate of the density matrix for the measured system identiﬁed as quantum
ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom and zero mode degrees of freedom identiﬁed as measuring system.
This simple prediction would be of utmost theoretical importance since the black box of the
quantum measurement theory would seem to reduce to basic quantum theory if the localization in
zero modes occurs automatically.

42
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
All visions are vulnerable to criticism and this particular vision is not an exception in this respect.
1. The result follows as a consequences of NMP if one assumes that it applies to the entanglement
between zero modes and that zero modes are entangled with quantum numbers. One can argue
that if one accepts NMP as a general principle, it does not make sense to assume exceptions to
it.
2. The original hypothesis was that the localization of zero modes is a mathematical necessity
but it has become clear that a localization to ﬁnite 2n-dimensional orientable sub-manifolds in
the space of zero modes is in principle enough since the symplectic form assignable to the zero
modes deﬁnes a positive deﬁnite integration measure (needed for the inner product) in this kind
of sub-manifolds. A weaker condition would be the the localization takes place to a ﬁnite region
of zero mode sector and takes place within ﬁnite measurement resolution.
3. There is no proposal for how the correlation between quantum numbers and zero modes is
generated.
The recent formulation of quantum TGD in terms of the modiﬁed Dirac action
containing a measurement interaction term linear in conserved quantum numbers provides the
coupling between quantum numbers of the state and space-time geometry [K25] . Zero modes
can be identiﬁed quite precisely in terms of the geometry of the partonic 2-surface and its 4-D
tangent space and correspond locally to the induced K¨ahler form of CP2. Quantum numbers
aﬀect the projection of the induced K¨ahler form to the complement of the tangent space of X2 in
the tangent space of the space-time sheet. This indeed gives hopes about 1-1 coding of quantum
numbers to the values of zero modes in terms of the induced K¨ahler form of the space-time
sheet. Note however that classical determinism in the standard sense of the word fails by the
special properties of K¨ahler action.
Also self measurements are possible
TGD allows also second type of quantum measurement following ordinary quantum measurement
reducing entanglement in quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom for some sub-system-complement
pair inside self which corresponds to a state localized in zero modes. This measurement can be regarded
as a self measurement and there is entire cascade of them reducing the state to a completely classical
product state. The process is obviously the counterpart of the phenomenological state preparation
process in quantum physics. The only universal observable is the density matrix of the sub-system,
which should be thus measured in the quantum jump. Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP)
governs the dynamics of self measurement and states that the the density matrix of a sub-system of
self for which the reduction of entanglement entropy is maximal, is measured in self measurement. In
the real context self measurement means a reduction of the entanglement and provides a mechanism
of self-repair: NMP [K44] says that the biggest hole in the leaking boat is ﬁlled ﬁrst. In p-adic context
NMP becomes the basic dynamical principle of cognition.
It is however far from obvious what the notion of quantum measurement means when quantum
states are quantum histories. For instance, the precise deﬁnition of the sub-system concept involves
nontrivial delicacies caused by the classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action.
In absence of this
non-determinism, all self measurements could be assigned to the boundary of the future light cone
(big bang) in accordance with the quantum holography principle. The resolution of these problems
emerged with the advent of zero energy ontology.
1. In zero energy ontology the imbedding space correlates of selves are causal diamonds (CDs)
identiﬁable as intersection of future and past directed light-cones of M 4. As a matter fact, the
cartesian product of CD × CP2 is in question but I will use just the term CD. Also unions of
selves are possible and there is a fractal hierarchy of selves if one accepts the hypothesis that
the proper time distance between the tips of CD is an octave of CP2 time scale identiﬁable
as secondary p-adic time scale.
The study of the moduli space of self suggests unexpected
connections with cosmology: in fact, the proper time distance between the tips is analogous to
cosmic time. The understanding of the arrow of this particular time emerges naturally from
the fact that this distance is bound to increase during the sequence of quantum jumps. The
introduction of the hierarchy of Planck constants brings in also the imbedding space-correlate
for the choice of the quantization axes, which is also a vital part of quantum measurement as
one particular state function reduction.

2.2. TGD inspired theory of consciousness
43
2. The light-like 3-surfaces connecting the light-like boundaries of CD are space-time correlates of
self. Also the space-like 3-surfaces at these boundaries serve as these correlates. This implies
holography: 2-D partonic surfaces plus their 4-D tangent spaces serve are enough for space-
time correlates for selves and everything about self hierarchy should be formulated in terms
of these plus intersections of CDs, which is assumed to be necessary for the fusion of mental
images having as a space-time correlate the formation of ﬂux tubes connecting space-time sheets
representing sub-selves.
The relationship of NMP to the second law of thermodynamics can be understood roughly as
follows.
The reduction of entanglement entropy leads to a random unentangled state pair in the
case of entropic entanglement unless it is bound state entanglement in which case no reduction takes
place. The outcome at the level of ensemble is increase of entropy. The possibility of negentropic
entanglement can however change the situation and the breaking of the second law in the time scale
of CD is expected [K44] .
Quantum jump as quantum computation like process
The Universe according to TGD is a quantum computer in an extremely general sense of the word.
Every quantum jump involves unitary informational ”time development” U (quantum computation)
and state function reduction involving a localization in the zero modes (halting of the computation)
and a sequence of self measurements giving rise to state function reduction in genealized sense. It
is neither possible nor necessary to assign Schr¨odinger equation with U. U is however completely
analogous to the time evolution operator U(−t, t), t →∞, deﬁning the S-matrix in quantum ﬁeld
theories. It is important to notice that also in quantum ﬁeld theories one is interested only in the
S-matrix so that new interpretation brings in nothing new at practical level.
There are thus three time developments in TGD:
1. The geometric time development of the space-time surface determined by the condition that
the extremals are critical in the sense that they allow an inﬁnite number of deformations with
a vanishing second variation of the K¨ahler action, which also via general coordinate invariance
deﬁnes in what sense quantum histories are histories;
2. The informational ”time development” U-unitary process- analogous to quantum computation
(hence the attribute ’informational’) represented by S-matrix;
3. The subjective time development by quantum jumps taking outside the realm of the space-time.
These three notions of time development fuse to single ”holy trinity” of informational, subjective and
geometric time evolutions. This ”holy trinity” of time evolutions corresponds to the ”holy trinity” of
1. matter in the sense of res extensa identiﬁed as 3-surfaces,
2. ideas/objective realities (logos= cosmos) identiﬁed as quantum histories (physics= mathemat-
ics)3.
3. and the world of subjective experiences deﬁned by the quantum jump sequences for selves
(mathematician exists subjectively in the quantum jumps between mathematical ideas).
Tri-partism allows to overcome the basic diﬃculties of the monistic and dualistic world pictures.
In particular, the theory-reality dualism disappears.
It should be emphasized that in this framework the standard physics identiﬁcation of the time
parameter of Schr¨odinger evolution with geometric time is wrong. The diﬃcult and many-faceted
problem, to be discussed later, is how the value of geometric time associated with the contents of
conscious experience is determined.
3Quantum histories can be regarded as superpositions of Boolean statements represented by many fermion Fock
states (fermion number=1↔true, fermion number =0↔false), hence logos=cosmos identiﬁcation.

2.2.2
Negentropy Maximization Principle
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP [K44] ) stating that the reduction of entanglement entropy
is maximal at a given step of state function reduction process following U-process is the basic varia-
tional principle for TGD inspired theory of consciousness and says that the information contents of
conscious experience is maximal. Although this principle is diametrically opposite to the second law
of thermodynamics it is structurally similar to the second law. NMP does not dictate the dynamics
completely since in state function reduction any eigen state of the density matrix is allowed as ﬁnal
state. NMP need not be in contradiction with second law of thermodynamics which might relate as
much to the ageing of mental images as to physical reality.
Basic form of NMP
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) in its original form codes for the basic rules of the standard
state function reduction and implies that system ends up to an eigenstate of the density matrix
identiﬁed as observable. In TGD framework must ask whether NMP should be restricted only to the
entanglement between zero modes of WCW representing classical degrees of freedom and quantum
ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom or generalize it to apply to any pair of subsystems so that state function
reduction sequence could be regarded as a sequence of self measurements. I have chosen the latter
option as a working hypothesis.
NMP that the state function reduction process following U-process gives rise to a maximal re-
duction of entanglement entropy at each step of the process. State function process could proceed
at the level of all CDs. It is not clear whether one can assign any geometric time duration to this
process or whether there is any need for this. If the ubsystem allows entangled pairs of free systems
(no binding energy) there is more or less unique pair with the maximal entanglement entropy and
NMP therefore implies a decomposition to a unique pair of unentangled systems. The process repeats
itself for these systems and stops when the resulting subsystem cannot be decomposed to a pair of free
systems since energy conservation makes the reduction of entanglement kinematically impossible in
the case of bound states. Number theoretic entanglement entropies mean an important modiﬁcation
of this picture.
Number theoretic Shannon entropy as information
The notion of number theoretic entropy obtained by can be deﬁned by replacing in Shannon entropy the
logarithms of probabilities pn by the logarithms of their p-adic norms |pn|p. This replacement makes
sense for algebraic entanglement probabilities if appropriate algebraic extension of p-adic numbers is
used. What is new that entanglement entropy can be negative, so that algebraic entanglement can
carry information and NMP can force the generation of bound state entanglement so that evolution
could lead to the generation of larger coherent bound states rather than only reducing entanglement.
A possible interpretation for algebraic entanglement is in terms of experience of understanding or
some positive emotion like love.
Standard formalism of physics lacks a genuine notion of information and one can speak only about
increase of information as a local reduction entropy. It seems strange that a system gaining wisdom
should increase the entropy of the environment. Hence number theoretic information measures could
have highly non-trivial applications also outside the theory consciousness.
NMP combined with number theoretic entropies leads to an important exception to the rule that
the generation of bound state entanglement between system and its environment during U process
leads to a loss of consciousness. When entanglement probabilities are rational (or even algebraic)
numbers, the entanglement entropy deﬁned as a number theoretic variant of Shannon entropy can
be non-positive (actually is) so that entanglement carries information. NMP favors the generation of
algebraic entanglement. The attractive interpretation is that the generation of algebraic entanglement
leads to an expansion of consciousness (”fusion into the ocean of consciousness”) instead of its loss.
State function reduction period of the quantum jumps involves much more than in wave mechan-
ics. For instance, the choice of quantization axes realized at the level of geometric delicacies related
to CDs is involved. U-process generates a superposition of states in which any sub-system can have
both real and algebraic entanglement with the external world. If state function reduction involves
also a choice between generic and negentropic entanglement (between real world, a particular p-adic
world, or their intersection) it might be possible to identify a candidate for the physical correlate for

2.2. TGD inspired theory of consciousness
45
the choice between good and evil. The hedonistic complete freedom resulting as the entanglement
entropy is reduced to zero on one hand, and the algebraic bound state entanglement implying cor-
relations with the external world and meaning giving up the maximal freedom on the other hand.
The hedonistic option is risky since it can lead to non-algebraic bound state entanglement implying
a loss of consciousness. The second option means expansion of consciousness - a fusion to the ocean
of consciousness as described by spiritual practices. Note that if the total entanglement negentropy
deﬁned as sum of contributions from various levels of CD hierarchy up to the highest matters in NMP
then also subselves should develop negentropic entanglement. For instance, the generation of entropic
entanglement at cell level can lead to a loss of consciousness also at higher levels. Life would evolve
from short to long scales.
Life as islands of rational/algebraic numbers in the seas of real and p-adic continua?
Rational and even algebraic entanglement coeﬃcients make sense in the intersection of real and p-adic
words, which suggests that life and conscious intelligence reside in the intersection of the real and
p-adic worlds. This would mean that the mathematical expressions for the space-time surfaces (or
at least 3-surfaces or partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D tangent planes) make sense in both real and
p-adic sense for some primes p. Same would apply to the expressions deﬁning quantum states. In
particular, entanglement probabilities would be rationals or algebraic numbers so that entanglement
can be negentropic and the formation of bound states in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds
generates information and is thus favored by NMP.
The identiﬁcation of intentionality as the basic aspect of life seems to be consistent with this idea.
1. The proposed realization of the intentional action has been as a transformation of p-adic space-
time sheet to a real one. Also transformations of real space-time sheets to p-adic space-time
sheets identiﬁable as cognitions are possible. Algebraic entanglement is a prerequisite for the
realization of intentions in this manner. Essentially a leakage between p-adic and real worlds is
in question and makes sense only in zero energy ontology. The reason is that various quantum
numbers in real and p-adic sectors are not in general comparable in positive energy ontology so
that conservation laws would be broken or even cease to make sense.
2. The transformation of intention to action can occur if the partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D
tangent space-distributions are representable using rational functions with rational (or even
algebraic) coeﬃcients in preferred coordinates for the imbedding space dictated by symmetry
considerations. Intentional systems must live in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
3. For the minimal option life would be also eﬀectively 2-dimensional phenomenon and essentially a
boundary phenomenon as also number theoretical criticality suggests. There are good reasons to
expect that only the data from the intersection of real and p-adic partonic two-surfaces appears
in U-matrix so that only the data from rational and some algebraic points of the partonic 2-
surface dictate U-matrix. This means discretization at parton level and something which might
be called number theoretic quantum ﬁeld theory should emerge as a description of intentional
action.
A good guess is that algebraic entanglement is essential for quantum computation, which therefore
might correspond to a conscious process. Hence cognition could be seen as a quantum computation
like process, a more approriate term being quantum problem solving [K23] . Living-dead dichotomy
could correspond to rational-irrational or to algebraic-transcendental dichotomy: this at least when
life is interpreted as intelligent life. Life would in a well deﬁned sense correspond to islands of rational-
ity/algebraicity in the seas of real and p-adic continua. Life as a critical phenomenon in the number
theoretical sense would be one aspect of quantum crticality of TGD Universe besides the criticality
of the space-time dynamics and the criticality with respect to phase transitions changing the value of
Planck constant and other more familiar criticalities. How closely these criticalities relate remains an
open question [K69] .
The view about the crucial role of rational and algebraic numbers as far as intelligent life is
considered, could have been guessed on very general grounds from the analogy with the orbits of a
dynamical system. Rational numbers allow a predictable periodic decimal/pinary expansion and are
analogous to one-dimensional periodic orbits. Algebraic numbers are related to rationals by a ﬁnite

46
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
number of algebraic operations and are intermediate between periodic and chaotic orbits allowing an
interpretation as an element in an algebraic extension of any p-adic number ﬁeld. The projections of
the orbit to various coordinate directions of the algebraic extension represent now periodic orbits. The
decimal/pinary expansions of transcendentals are un-predictable being analogous to chaotic orbits.
The special role of rational and algebraic numbers was realized already by Pythagoras, and the fact
that the ratios for the frequencies of the musical scale are rationals supports the special nature of
rational and algebraic numbers. The special nature of the Golden Mean, which involves
√
5, conforms
the view that algebraic numbers rather than only rationals are essential for life.
Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 and NMP
Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 bring in additional delicacies to NMP. The basic implication of ﬁnite
measurement resolution characterized by Jones inclusion is that state function reduction can never
reduce entanglement completely so that entire universe can be regarded as an inﬁnite living organism.
It would seem that entanglement coeﬃcients become N valued and the same is true for eigen states
of density matrix. For quantum spinors associated with M/N entanglement probabilities must be
deﬁned as traces of the operators N. An open question is whether entanglement probabilities deﬁned in
this manner are algebraic numbers always (as required by the notion of number theoretic entanglement
entropy) or only in special cases.
2.2.3
Quantum self
In the following the notion of self is introduced. To avoid confusions it must be emphasised that the
notion of self is completely general and by no means restricted to brain. Brain consciousness is in this
framework only a special form of consciousness.
The notions of self and subjective memory
The simplest hypothesis is that the contents of consciousness are determined by single quantum jump.
There are several objections to this view.
1. The idea about self as a continuous stream of consciousness is very attractive and it seems diﬃcult
to believe that our consciousness could be actually a sequence of moments of consciousness with
gaps between.
2. Furthermore, if the contents of consciousness are determined completely by the initial and ﬁnal
states of single quantum jump, we cannot have any memories about our previous conscious
experiences.
Hence subjective memories should be only pseudo memories perhaps resulting
from the simulations of the subjective past.
It took quite a long time to realize the real strength of these objections and to discover that a
proper quantum deﬁnition of the concept of self provides a manner to overcome these obstacles.
1. Entanglement is one of the basic non-classical notions of quantum theory.
(a) Un-entangled sub-system, as opposed to an entangled one, behaves as its own sub-universe
and can be regarded as a pure quantum state. The natural guess is that self should be
identiﬁed as a sub-system able to remain unentangled in subsequent quantum jumps. The
self lasting only single quantum jump can be also regarded formally as self. This kind
of a deﬁnition looks intuitively satisfactory since me-external world separation is a basic
characteristic of everyday consciousness.
(b) Spiritual practices however speak about quite diﬀerent states of consciousness in which
a fusion to a sea of consciousness takes place.
Self in the sense of ego is lost but not
consciousness. The generation of negentropic entanglement could be the correlate for these
experiences whereas the reduction of entropic entanglement would be characterstic of the
experiences with me-external world separation.

2.2. TGD inspired theory of consciousness
47
2. The entanglement between real and p-adic space-time regions is possible if entanglement proa-
bilities are algebraic numbers [K44] . In this case the entangement entropy can be negative and
minimum for a unique choice of prime deﬁning the p-adic norm. Negentropic entanglement can
become only more negentropic in quantum jump and can be stable against NMP. This means
a period of macrotemporal cognitive quantum coherence during which a sequence of quantum
jumps is eﬀectively fused to a single quantum jump. A natural hypothesis is that negentropic
entanglement is possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds which by deﬁnition consists
of partonic 2-surfaces for which mathematical representation makes sense in both real and p-adic
number ﬁelds. Rational functions for which the deﬁning polynomials have rational coeﬃcients
represents the simplest example of this kind of situation. The interpretation of the negentropic
entanglement as a correlate for a conscious rule or association is natural. Negentropically en-
tangled Schr¨odinger cat knows that it is better to not open the bottle.
3. The hypothesis that the experiences of self associated with the quantum jumps occurred after
the ”wake-up” (the quantum jump during which U made sub-system unentangled or created
unentangled subystem) sum up to single experience, implies that self can have memories about
earlier moments of consciousness. Therefore the self becomes an extended object with respect to
the subjective time and has a well deﬁned ”personal history”. Subjective memory has a natural
identiﬁcation as a short term memory with a duration of order second.
4. If the temporal binding of experiences involves some kind of averaging, that is, if quantum
statistical determinism generalizes to the level of the subjective experience, the total experience
deﬁned by the heap of the experiences associated with individual quantum jumps is reliable.
5. Self can have sub-selves: this corresponds geometrically to a space-time sheet having smaller
space-time sheets glued to it.
An irreducible self is deﬁned as a self having no sub-selves.
Reducible and irreducible selves give rise to two modes of consciousness identiﬁable as ordinary
and ”whole-body” consciousness.
6. The sub-selves of two selves can entangle if one allows the deﬁnition of sub-system concept
based on p-adic length scale cutoﬀ. Essentially this means that because of the p-adic length
scale cutoﬀ, the entanglement of sub-systems is not ’seen’ at the level of systems so that they can
remain unentangled. p-Adic length scale cutoﬀis natural since the wormhole contacts associated
with topologically condensed space-time sheets are surrounded by ’elementary particle horizons’
analogous to blackhole horizons. Therefore the larger space-time sheet ’sees’ about topologically
condensed space-time sheet only some quantum numbers like mass, spin and charge. There
are two types of fusion of mental images corresponding to entropic bound state entanglement
and negentropic entanglement. The latter could correspond to conscious mental images about
rule, concept, or association with entangled state pairs representing instances of the abstraction.
The entanglement of sub-systems makes possible fusion and sharing of mental images crucial
for quantum communications. For instance, receiver can understand the message by sharing the
mental image of the sender representing the understanding of the message.
7. Sub-system can wake-up (become conscious self) in several manners.
The phase transitions
R ↔Rp inside real/p-adic self generate new p-adic/real sub-selves. In fact, real–p-adic phase
transitions could correspond to the transformation of sensory input into cognition and thought
into action. Also the transitions Rp1 →Rp2 inside p1-adic self generate new p2-adic sub-selves.
Summation hypothesis and binding of experiences
The self X behaves essentially as a separate sub-Universe. Also the sub-selves of Xi of X have their
own experiences. The question is: how the experience of X and experiences of Xi are related? The
following basic hypothesis provides a possible answer to this question.
1. X experiences the sub-selves Xi as separate mental images superposed to the pure self experience
of X: this is natural since sub-selves are unentangled and hence behave like separate sub-
Universes.
2. The experiences of self X about the experiences of its sub-selves Xi are abstractions. Sub-self
Xi experiences its sub-selves Xij as separate mental images. X however experiences them as a

48
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
single mental image representing what it is to be a sub-self of Xi, that is the average ⟨Xij⟩of
the mental images Xij. Thus the mental images of sub-sub-...selves of X are smoothed out to an
average mental image and become eﬀectively unconcious to X. Averaging hypothesis generalizes
quantum statistical determinism to the level of subjective experience and is analogous to the
hypothesis about averaging related to temporal binding.
Temporal binding with averaging implies that the experiences of the individual selves are reliable
and abstraction brings in the possibility of quantum statistical determinism at the level of ensembles.
The inability to perceive the ﬂickering of light when the frequency of the ﬂickering is larger than
about one Hz is consistent with the hypothesis that subjective sensory memory has duration of order
.1 seconds and that temporal averaging indeed occurs. Time averaging could involve weighting such
that the conscious experiences associated with the last quantum jumps have the largest weight. This
would allow our self to have duration much longer than .1 seconds. For instance, the duration of the
ordinary wake-up period could determine the duration of our self. The duration could be even longer:
sleep could actually involve awareness and the lack of the sensory memories from sleep period could
create the illusion about sleep as an unconscious state.
Summation hypothesis and temporal binding imply a hierarchy of conscious experiences with
increasingly richer contents and at the top of the hierarchy is the entire universe, God, enjoying
eternal self-consciousness since it cannot entangle with with any larger system. Also we are mental
images of some higher level self. This hierarchy obviously has far-reaching consequences.
Binding of the experiencers by entanglement
The binding of experiencers is also possible. The binding of selves by quantum entanglement however
means they lose their consciousness. This process naturally corresponds to the formation of wholes
from their parts at the level of conscious experiences. The formation of a mental image (sub-self)
representing word from the mental images representing letters is example of this process. Also the
fusion of the left and right visual ﬁelds to a single visual ﬁeld could occur via the entanglement of the
corresponding sub-selves. Note however that right–left entanglement might occur already at neuronal
level.
Entanglement mechanism provides also a possible mechanism of ”enlightment” experiences
envolving extension of self [K70, K86] . Quantum entanglement could make possible communication
between selves belonging to diﬀerent levels of the self hierarchy.
Stable entanglement and quantum metabolism as diﬀerent sides of the same coin
The notion of binding has two meanings. Binding as a formation of bound state and binding as a
fusion of mental images to larger ones essential for the functioning of brain and regarded as one the
big problems of consciousness theory.
Only bound state entanglement and negentropic entanglement are stable against the state reduc-
tion process. Hence the fusion of the mental images implies the formation of a bound entropic state-
in this case the two interpretations of binding are equivalent- or a negentropic state, which need not
be bound state.
1. In the case of negentropic entanglement bound state need not be formed and the interesting
possibility is that the negentropic entanglement could give rise to stable states without binding
energy. This could allow to understand the mysterious high energy phosphate bond to which
metabolic energy is assigned in ATP molecule containing three phosphates and liberated as
ATP decays to ADP and phosphate molecule. Negentropic entanglement could also explain the
stability of DNA and other highly charged biopolymers. In this framework the liberation of
metabolic (negentropic) energy would involve dropping of electrons to a larger space-time sheets
accompanying the process ATP →ADP + Pi. A detailed model of this process is discussed
in [K26] .
2. The formation of bound state entanglement is expected to involve a liberation of the binding
energy and this energy might be a usable energy.
This process could perhaps be coined as
quantum metabolism and one could say that quantum metabolism and formation of bound
states are diﬀerent sides of the same coin. It is known that an intense neural activity, although
it is accompanied by an enhanced blood ﬂow to the region surrounding the neural activity,

2.2. TGD inspired theory of consciousness
49
does not involve an enhanced oxidative metabolism [J45] (that is ATP →ADP process and
its reversal). A possible explanation is that quantum metabolism accompanying the binding is
involved. Note that the bound state is sooner or later destroyed by the thermal noise so that
this mechanism would in a rather clever manner utilize thermal energy by applying what might
be called buy now–pay later principle.
If these interpretations are correct, there would be two modes of metabolism corresponding to two
diﬀerent kinds of fusion of mental images.
How to understand evolution and self-organization?
One could argue that since the quantum jump is random (not actually since selection between the
eigenstates of the density matrix occurs), quantum jump as a moment of consciousness identiﬁcation
cannot explain evolution. In standard physics it is diﬃcult to circumvent this objection. Even worse,
heat death seems to be the ultimate fate of the universe according to standard physics.
The fact that quantum jump involves localization in zero modes and thus localization into a
deﬁnite sector DP of conﬁguration space labelled by inﬁnite prime P, implies evolution as a statistical
increase of P. Since inﬁnite primes are in well-deﬁned sense composites of ﬁnite primes, this in turn
implies that the ﬁnite p-adic prime associated with a given sub-system tends to increase and that new
space-time sheets labelled by ﬁnite primes emerge during the time evolution by quantum jumps.
This means that the concept of nearness deﬁning the eﬀective topology becomes gradually more re-
ﬁned, the complexity of the universe increases, and the maximal information contents of the conscious
experience increase in the long run (like p × log(p) or at least as log(p) as a function of p-adic prime
characterizing the system). This is nothing but evolution. NMP, which states that entanglement
negentropy gain maximal for allowed quantum jumps, enhances this tendency.
Quantum jumps between quantum histories make also possible genuine quantum self-organization.
The concept of self-organization gets quite new additional meaning in TGD framework. Self-organization
means also evolution of self-hierarchies (MEs inside MEs inside...).
Self-organization by quantum
jumps can be regarded as a hopping in the zero modes characterizing the macroscopic aspects of
the space-time surface.
Each self is a dissipative system which ends up to some asymptotic self-
organization pattern in the presence of the external energy feed (or even without it). Dissipation
is the ultimate Darwinian selector picking up the winning selves as favoured self organization pat-
terns. Since sub-selves correspond to mental images, the immediate implication is that also memes
are subject to similar selection. For instance, the formation of long term memories and habits could
be understood as a formation of surviving sub-selves.
The proposed realization of the quantum criticality, besides making macroscopic quantum systems
possible, in a well-deﬁned sense maximizes the intelligence and complexity of the universe [K14] .
TGD universe is quantum spin glass and this adds additional aspect to the self-organization process.
For instance, the energy landscape of the spin glass is fractal like structure containing valleys inside
valleys and provides an ideal dynamical memory mechanism.
Quantum ethics very brieﬂy
There are many manners to interpret evolution in TGD Universe.
1. p-Adic evolution would mean a gradual increase of the inﬁnite p-adic prime characterizing the
entire universe implying the gradual increase of p-adic primes characterizing individual partonic
2-surfaces and therefore their size. The identiﬁcation of p-adic space-time sheets as representa-
tions for intentions and the identiﬁcation of p-adic-to-real phase transitions as transformations
of intentions to real actions gives additional concreteness to this vision.
2. The hierarchy of Planck constants suggests evolution as the gradual increase of the Planck
constant characterizing p-adic space-time sheet (or partonic 2-surface for the minimal option).
This evolution could be seen as a migration to the pages of the book like structure deﬁned by
the generalized imbedding space and has therefore quite concrete geometric meaning. It implies
longer time scales of long term memory and planned action and macroscopic quantum coherence
in longer scales.

50
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
3. The vision about life as something in the intersection of real and p-adic words allows to see
evolution information theoretically as the increase of number entanglement negentropy implying
entanglement in increasing length scales.
This option is consistent with the ﬁrst one if the
eﬀective p-adic topology characterizes the real partonic 2-surfaces in the intersection of p-adic
and real worlds. The singular coverings of CD s and CP2 are characterized by an Abelian group
Zn permuting the sheets of the covering and corresponds naturally to powers of the (quantum)
phase q = exp(i2π/n) allowing to deﬁne the notion of angle in p-adic context but only with a
ﬁnite resolution since only ﬁnite number of angles are represented as phases for a given value
of n. The increase of the integers n could be interpreted as the emergence of higher algebraic
extensions of p-adic numbers in the intersection of the real and p-adic worlds. These observations
suggest that all three views about evolution are closely related.
The third kind of evolution would mean also the evolution of spiritual consciousness if the pro-
posed interpretation is correct. In each quantum jump U-process generates a superposition of states in
which any sub-system can have both real and algebraic entanglement with the external world. If state
function redution process involves also the choice of the type of entanglement it could be interpreted
as a choice between good and evil. The hedonistic complete freedom resulting as the entanglement
entropy is reduced to zero on one hand, and the algebraic bound state entanglement implying cor-
relations with the external world and meaning giving up the maximal freedom on the other hand.
The selﬁsh option has the risk of leading to non-algebraic bound state entanglement implying a loss
of consciousness: death as the prize of sin. The second option means expansion of consciousness - a
fusion to the ocean of consciousness as described by spiritual practices.
In this framework one could therefore understand the physics correlates of ethics and moral. The
ethics is simple: evolution of consciousness to higher levels is a good thing. Anything which tends to
reduce consciousness represents violence and is a bad thing. Moral rules are related to the relationship
between indvidual and society and presumably develop via self-organization process and are by no
means unique. Moral rules however tend to optimize evolution. As blind normative rules they can
however become a source of violence identiﬁed as any action which reduces the level of consciousness.
There is an entire hierarchy of selves and every self has the selﬁsh desire to survive and moral
rules develop as a kind of compromise and evolve all the time. The newest progress in this evolution
is brought by the cosmology of consciousness, which forces to extend the concept of society to four-
dimensional society! The decisions of ”me now” aﬀect both my past and future and time like quantum
entanglement makes possible conscious communication in time direction by sharing conscious experi-
ences. One can therefore speak of genuinely four-dimensional society. Besides my next-door neighbors
I had better to take into account also my nearest neighbors in past and future (the nearest ones being
perhaps copies of me!). If I make wrong decisions those copies of me in future and past will suﬀer the
most. Perhaps my personal hell and paradise are here and are created mostly by me.
Selves can make plans since they have 4-dimensional geometric memory (conscious experience
contains information about a four-dimensional space-time region, rather than only time=constant
snapshot, and gives rise to a ”prophecy”, a prediction for the future and past, which would be reliable
if the world were completely classical). As a matter fact, it is p-adic space-time sheets which correspond
to intentions and plans and act of volition transforms p-adic space-time sheet to a real one. Selves can
make decisions and select between various classical macroscopic time developments. Selves are able
to remember their choices since they have subjective memories about the previous quantum jumps.
Thus selves are genuine moral agents.
Implications of the dark matter hierarchy for the notion of self
The identiﬁcation of dark matter as phases having large value of Planck constant [K73, K92, K20] led
to a vigorous evolution of ideas still continuing while I am writing this addendum to the original text.
Entire dark matter hierarchy with levels labelled by increasing values of Planck constant is predicted,
and in principle TGD predicts the values of Planck constant if physics as a generalized number
theory vision is accepted [K92] . Also a good educated guess for the spectrum of Planck constants
emerges. The implications are non-trivial already at the level of hadron physics and nuclear physics
and imply that condensed matter physics and nuclear physics are not completely disjoint disciplines as
reductionism teaches us. One condensed matter application is a model of high Tc superconductivity
predicting that the basic length scales of cell membrane and cell as scales are inherent to high Tc
superconductors.

2.2. TGD inspired theory of consciousness
51
1. Living matter and dark matter
Living matter as ordinary matter quantum controlled by the dark matter hierarchy has turned out
to be a particularly successful idea. The hypothesis has led to models for EEG predicting correctly
the band structure and even individual resonance bands and also generalizing the notion of [J27] [K21]
. Also a generalization of the notion of genetic code emerges resolving the paradoxes related to the
standard dogma [K40, K21] . A particularly fascinating implication is the possibility to identify great
leaps in evolution as phase transitions in which new higher level of dark matter emerges [K21] .
It seems safe to conclude that the dark matter hierarchy with levels labelled by the values of
Planck constants explains the macroscopic and macro-temporal quantum coherence naturally. That
this explanation is consistent with the explanation based on spin glass degeneracy is suggested by
following observations. First, the argument supporting spin glass degeneracy as an explanation of
the macro-temporal quantum coherence does not involve the value of ℏat all. Secondly, the failure
of the perturbation theory assumed to lead to the increase of Planck constant and formation of
macroscopic quantum phases could be precisely due to the emergence of a large number of new degrees
of freedom due to spin glass degeneracy. Thirdly, the phase transition increasing Planck constant has
concrete topological interpretation in terms of many-sheeted space-time consistent with the spin glass
degeneracy.
2. Dark matter hierarchy and the notion of self
The vision about dark matter hierarchy leads to a more reﬁned view about self hierarchy and
hierarchy of moments of consciousness [K20, K21] . The hierarchy of dark matter levels is labeled
by the values of Planck constant having quantized but arbitrarily large values. For the most general
option the values of ℏare products and ratios of two integers. The products of distinct Fermat primes
and power of two are number theoretically favored values for these integers.
p-Adic length scale
hypothesis favors powers of two. The larger the value of Planck constant, the longer the subjectively
experienced duration and the average geometric duration T ∝ℏof the quantum jump.
Dark matter hierarchy suggests also a slight modiﬁcation of the notion of self. Each self involves
a hierarchy of dark matter levels, and one is led to ask whether the highest level in this hierarchy
corresponds to single quantum jump rather than a sequence of quantum jumps. The averaging of
conscious experience over quantum jumps would occur only for sub-selves at lower levels of dark
matter hierarchy and these mental images would be ordered, and single moment of consciousness
would be experienced as a history of events. One can ask whether even entire life cycle could be
regarded as a single quantum jump at the highest level so that consciousness would not be completely
lost even during deep sleep. This would allow to understand why we seem to know directly that this
biological body of mine existed yesterday.
The fact that we can remember phone numbers with 5 to 9 digits supports the view that self corre-
sponds at the highest dark matter level to single moment of consciousness. Self would experience the
average over the sequence of moments of consciousness associated with each sub-self but there would
be no averaging over the separate mental images of this kind, be their parallel or serial. These mental
images correspond to sub-selves having shorter wake-up periods than self and would be experienced as
being time ordered. Hence the digits in the phone number are experienced as separate mental images
and ordered with respect to experienced time.
2.2.4
About geometric correlates of selves
Space-time sheets with a ﬁnite time duration serve as geometric correlates for selves. There are several
questions to answer. For instance, one should understand how the conscious experiences associated
with the p-adic and real space-time sheets diﬀer. Also one should understand how psychological time
and its arrow emerge in this picture.
Cognition, imagination and p-adic physics
The problem about geometric correlates of cognition is not yet completely resolved. An important
problem is what one understands with cognition and loose deﬁnitions might generate additional con-
fusion. Intuitively it is clear that cognition should correspond to thinking. The simplest model for
logical thinking is based on Boolean algebra: one could however argue that ’this is true’ experiences
are actually much like ordinary sensory experiences.
Besides true/false dichotomy there are also

52
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
beatiful/ugly and right/wrong dichotomies which suggests that aesthetics, moral, and logic might cor-
respond to various aspects of some Boolean structure having physical interpretation and that cognition
involves logic as one aspect only. Imagination is an important aspect of thinking and one could also
consider the identiﬁcation of the most fundamental aspect of cognition as imagination and perhaps
even identify cognition as imagination.
The notion of the many-sheeted space-time decomposing into real and p-adic space-time sheets,
and the classical non-determinism of the K¨ahler action making possible experiences with temporally
localized information contents, are the key elements of TGD based model of consciousness.
The notions of mindlike space-time sheet (space-time sheet with a ﬁnite temporal duration) and
association sequence were originally identiﬁed as geometric correlates of thoughts quite generally.
On the other hand, the inherent non-determinism of p-adic diﬀerential equations means that the
solutions of p-adic counterparts of ﬁeld equations consist of pieces which are characterized by ordinary
integration constants glued together. This is very much like the non-determinism of imagination and
dreams, and inspires the hypothesis that p-adic space-time sheets serve as cognitive representations.
Real mindlike space-time would be the geometric correlates of sensory mental images rather than
cognition. The diﬀerence between real and imagined experiences would correspond to real–p-adic
distinction. One must be however very cautious here: one cannot exclude the possibility that also
cognition is one aspect of sensory experience and that the notion of imagined cognition makes sense.
It is also somewhat a convention, what is counted as cognition.
What we regard as imagination presumably involves p-adic–to–real transitions giving rise to initial
values determining nerve pulse patterns generating almost motor actions and almost sensory percep-
tions Also cell membrane oscillation patterns could represent imagination whereas nerve pulses give
rise to sensory experiences. Thus p-adic physics would represent the core element of imagination and
cognition. There are still unclear points: what seems certain that p-adic physics represents intention-
ality but one can debate about whether it represents also imagination and cognition.
What space-time surfaces look like?
The notion of the space-time surface appears often in the sequel and deserves some explaining. Math-
ematician’s notion of the space-time surface is more general than the intuitive notion about it. For
instance, space-time surface can be union of disjoint surfaces (2-D visualization: 2-surface can consist
of several disjoint 2-surfaces: sphere here and piece of plane there,..). Space-time sheet is near to what
one intuitively would understand with a space-time surface.
The TGD based notion of space-time surface is roughly the following.
1. One obtains piece of Minkowski space as a 4-surface deﬁned by putting CP2 coordinates constant:
this is simplest kind of a vacuum extremal. By suitably deforming one obtains inﬁnitely many
vacuum extremals. Vacuum extremals can have ﬁnite time duration: in this case they correspond
to mindlike space-time sheets.
2. Allowing several values for CP2 coordinates one obtains several ’parallel’ pieces of Minkowski
space which can be deformed to more general vacuum extremals. These sheets can be glued
together by wormhole contacts and deformed so that they are not vacua anymore.
3. By gluing extremely small surfaces representing elementary particles to this complex one obtains
a rough view about what TGD space-time surface looks like.
4. Besides real regions there are also p-adic regions but these look like fractal dust in real topology.
p-Adic and real regions are glued together at rational points of imbedding space.
Two-dimensional visualization might also help. Put z-coordinate constant in 3-space and allow
several values of z-coordinate: you get several parallel pieces of plane. Deform them and glue them
together by wormhole contacts. Glue elementary particle like surfaces, represented by, say, extremely
tiny spheres and tori.

Association sequences and mindlike space-time sheets
The concepts of mindlike space-time sheet and association sequence are crucial for TGD based quan-
tum model of intelligent system [K14] .
Mindlike space-time sheets are geometric correlates of selves (see Fig. 2). They are made possible
by the huge vacuum degeneracy of the K¨ahler action, TGD and more standard theories of physics.
By gluing vacuum extremals to nonvacuum space-time surfaces and suitably deforming, one obtains
new degenerate absolute minima. One manner to see mindlike space-time sheets is as the classical
counterparts of the virtual particles of the quantum ﬁeld theories (in TGD particles are 3-surfaces!)
created from vacuum and returning to it.
By deﬁnition material space-time sheets have inﬁnite
temporal extension whereas mindlike space-time sheets have ﬁnite temporal extension. Finite temporal
extension is possible since classical conserved quantities like energy can ﬂow to mindlike space-time
sheet begins and ﬂow back to a material space-time sheet when mindlike space-time sheet ends. The
ﬁnite temporal extension implies that the information contents of the conscious experiences for selves
associated with the mindlike space-time sheets are temporally localized. Thus a rough idea about the
origin of the psychological time emerges. Mindlike space-time sheets provide cognitive representations
for the material space-time sheets to which they are glued by wormhole contacts and/or join along
boundaries contacts. Since the sign of the classical energy in TGD correlates with the time orientation
of the space-time sheet, pairs of mindlike space-time sheets with vanishing net energy are possible.
Direct mimicry is the simplest possible cognitive representation and this kind of a two-sheeted structure
makes it possible! If this is indeed true, TGD universe would be physicist’s version of the computer
scientist’s universe populated by computers emulating each other.
The original belief was that association sequence provides a model for thought understood as
a simulation of the classical time development. This model does not necessitate p-adicity and one
can ask whether all cognition is p-adic or whether also real cognition based on the classical non-
determinism of K¨ahler action is possible. It is quite possible that the classical non-determinism of
K¨ahler action provides sensory rather than cognitive simulation of the classical time development in
the real context. This simulation could be naturally regarded as a symbolic representation whereas p-
adic nondeterminism would make possible cognitive representations. Thus real association sequences
would make possible language as symbolic representation of thoughts rather than thoughts as believed
originally.
1. The original motivation of the association sequence concept is the vacuum degeneracy of the
K¨ahler action. p-Adic non-determinism gives also rise to association sequences. This degeneracy
implies classical non-determinism in the sense that the absolute minimum X4(Y 3) of the K¨ahler
action associated with a given spacelike 3-surface Y 3 on lightcone boundary δM 4
+ × CP2 is not
unique in general. In order to get rid of this non-determinism one must generalize the concept of
3-surface. ”Association sequences”, deﬁned as 3-surfaces consisting of unions of some minimal
number of disjoint 3-surfaces with timelike(!) separations, must be allowed (see Fig. 1) in order
to ﬁx uniquely which degenerate absolute minimum is in question.
2. A simple model for association sequence is obtained by considering a non-deterministic motion
of a point in, say, plane. Suppose that there are N bifurcations. One can clearly ﬁx single
branch by ﬁxing N + 1 points on the orbit. The union of these points, which have time like
distances and are not clearly unique, deﬁnes association sequence. Non-determinism brings in
ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom characterized by a sequence of N binary digits.
3. Association sequence provides a simulation of the classical time evolution and gives rise to what
might be called ”geometric memory” involved with the intentional aspects of consciousness (plan-
ning, expectations, desires,...). Geometric memory can be regarded as a ”prophecy” for what
will happen and what must have happened earlier provided the world were classical (no quan-
tum jumps replacing the macroscopic classical space-time with a new one). Each quantum jump
involves naturally a comparison of the expected time development provided by the ”geometric
memory” and the actual subjective time development stored in the subjective memory.
4. Association sequences of ... of association sequences are also possible and the average spatial and
temporal distances ∆L and ∆T between fundamental building blocks of the association sequence
give measures for the temporal and spatial resolutions of the cognitive/sensory representation
provided by the association sequence.

54
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
Figure 2.1: ’Association sequence’: a geometric model for cognitive/sensory simulation as a sequence
of disjoint 3-surfaces with timelike separations.
The notions of mindlike space-time sheet and association sequence are frustratingly abstract con-
cepts. It has however become clear that MEs (massless extremals) provide very general, if not even
universal, identiﬁcation for the geometric correlates of selves. The lightlike boundaries of MEs carry
representations of superconformal and super-symplectic algebras and act as quantum holograms. The
general concepts of quantum information theory, the notion of quantum hologram in the sense of
both quantum information theory and quantum gravity, and perhaps even quantum computation (in
a suitably generalized sense) at the lightlike boundaries of MEs, seem to emerge as basic aspects of
TGD inspired theory of conscious information processing.
A genuinely TGD based aspect is the possibility of negative time orientations making possible
MEs carrying negative energies and representing classical signals proceeding into the direction of the
geometric past, and the communication to the direction of the geometric past distinguishes TGD
based and ordinary quantum information theory. This is especially interesting from the viewpoint of
lightlike quantum computation since the classical restrictions coming from the huge length of MEs for
reasonable computation times can be circumvented.
Space-time and imbedding space correlates for selves in zero energy ontology
Quantum jump as a moment of consciousness, self as a sequence of quantum jumps integrating to self,
and self hierarchy with sub-selves experienced as mental images, are the basic notions of TGD inspired
theory of consciousness. In the most ambitious vision self hierarchy reduces to a fractal hierarchy of
quantum jumps within quantum jumps. Quantum classical correspondence demands selves to have
space-time correlates both at the level of space-time and imbedding space.
At the level of space-time the ﬁrst guess for the correlates is as light-like or space-like 3-surfaces. If
one believes on eﬀective 2-dimensionality and quantum holography, partonic 2-surfaces plus their 4-D
tangent space distribution would code the information about the space-time correlates. By quantum
classical correspondence one can also identify space-time sheets as the correlates modulo the gauge
degeneracy implied by super-conformal symmetries.
It is natural to interpret CDs as correlates of selves at the level of the imbedding space. CDs can
be interpreted either as subsets of the generalized imbedding space or as sectors of WCW. Accordingly,
selves correspond to CDs of the generalized imbedding space or sectors of WCW, literally separate
interacting quantum Universes.
The spiritually oriented reader might speak of Gods.
Sub-selves
correspond to sub-CDs geometrically. The contents of consciousness of self is about the interior of the
corresponding CD at the level of imbedding space. For sub-selves the wave function for the position
of tip of CD brings in the delocalization of sub-WCW.
The fractal hierarchy of CDs within CDs is the geometric counterpart for the hierarchy of selves:
the quantization of the time scale of planned action and memory as T(k) = 2kT0 suggest an interpre-
tation for the fact that we experience octaves as equivalent in music experience.

2.2.5
Questions related to the notion of self
I have proposed two alternative notions of self and have not been able to choose between them.
A further question is what happens during sleep: do we lose consciousness or is it that we cannot
remember anything about this period? The work with the model of topological quantum computation
has led to an overall view allowing to select the most plausible answer to these questions. But let us
be cautious!
Can one choose between the two variants for the notion of self or are they equivalent?
I have considered two diﬀerent notions of ”self” and it is interesting to see whether the new view
about time might allow to choose between them or to show that they are actually equivalent.
1. In the original variant of the theory ”self” corresponds to a sequence of quantum jumps. ”Self”
would result through a binding of quantum jumps to single ”string” in close analogy and actually
in a concrete correspondence with the formation of bound states. Each quantum jump has a
fractal structure: unitary process is followed by a sequence of state function reductions and
preparations proceeding from long to short scales. Selves can have sub-selves and one has self
hierarchy. The questionable assumption is that self remains conscious only as long as it is able
to avoid entanglement with environment.
Even slightest entanglement would destroy self unless on introduces the notion of ﬁnite measure-
ment resolution applying also to entanglement. This notion is indeed central for entire quantum
TGD also leads to the notion of sharing of mental images: selves unentangled in the given mea-
surement resolution can experience shared mental images resulting as fusion of sub-selves by
entanglement not visible in the resolution used.
2. According to the newer variant of theory, quantum jump has a fractal structure so that there are
quantum jumps within quantum jumps: this hierarchy of quantum jumps within quantum jumps
would correspond to the hierarchy of dark matters labeled by the values of Planck constant.
Each fractal structure of this kind would have highest level (largest Planck constant) and this
level would corresponds to the self. What might be called irreducible self would corresponds
to a quantum jump without any sub-quantum jumps (no mental images). The quantum jump
sequence for lower levels of dark matter hierarchy would create the experience of ﬂow of subjective
time.
It would be nice to reduce the original notion of self hierarchy to the hierarchy deﬁned by quantum
jumps. There are some objections against this idea. One can argue that fractality is a purely geometric
notion and since subjective experience does not reduce to the geometry it might be that the notion of
fractal quantum jump does not make sense. It is also not quite clear whether the reasonable looking
idea about the role of entanglement as destroyer of self can be kept in the fractal picture.
These objections fail if one can construct a well-deﬁned mathematical scheme allowing to under-
stand what fractality of quantum jump at the level of space-time correlates means and showing that
the two views about self are equivalent. The following argument represents such a proposal. Let us
start from the causal diamond model as a lowest approximation for a model of zero energy states and
for the space-time region deﬁning the contents of sensory experience.
Let us make the following assumptions.
1. Assume the hierarchy of causal diamonds within causal diamonds in a sense to be speciﬁed more
precisely below. Causal diamonds would represent the volumes of attention. Assume that the
highest level in this hierarchy deﬁnes the quantum jump containing sequences of lower level
quantum jumps in some sense to be speciﬁed. Assume that these quantum jumps integrate
to single continuous stream of consciousness as long as the sub...-sub-self in question remains
unentangled and that entangling means loss of consciousness or at least that it is not possible
to remember anything about contents of consciousness during entangled state.
2. Assume that the contents of conscious experience come from the interior of the causal diamond.
A stronger condition would be that the contents come from the boundaries of the two light-cones
involved since physical states are deﬁned at these in the simplest picture. In this case one could
identify the lower light-cone boundary as giving rise to memory.

56
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
3. The time span characterizing the contents of conscious experience associated with a given quan-
tum jump would correspond to the temporal distance T between the tips of the causal diamond.
T would also characterize the average and approximate shift of the superposition of space-time
surfaces backwards in geometric time in single quantum jump at a given level of hierarchy. This
time scale naturally scales as Tn = 2nTCP2 so that p-adic length scale hypothesis follows as a con-
sequence. T would be essentially the secondary p-adic time scale T2,p = √pTp for p ≃2k. This
assumption - absolutely essential for the hierarchy of quantum jumps within quantum jumps -
would diﬀerentiate the model from the model in which T corresponds to either CP2 time scale
or p-adic time scale Tp. One would have hierarchy of quantum jumps with increasingly longer
time span for memory and with increasing duration of geometric chronon at the highest level of
fractal quantum jump. Without additional restrictions, the quantum jump at nth level would
contain 2n quantum jumps at the lowest level of hierarchy. Note that in the case of sub-self - and
without further assumptions which will be discussed next - one would have just two quantum
jumps: mental image appears, disappears or exists all the time. At the level of sub-sub-selves 4
quantum jumps and so on. Maybe this kind of simple predictions might be testable.
4. We know that that the contents of sensory experience comes from a rather narrow time interval
of duration about .1 seconds, which corresponds to the time scale T127 associated with electron.
We also know that there is asymmetry between positive and negative energy parts of zero energy
states both physically and at the level of conscious experience. This asymmetry must have some
space-time correlate. The simplest correlate for the asymmetry between positive and negative
energy states would be that the upper light-like boundaries in the structure formed by light-
cones within light-cones intersect along light-like radial geodesic.
No condition of this kind
would be posed on lower light-cone boundaries. The scaling invariance of this condition makes
it attractive mathematically and would mean that arbitrarily long time scales Tn can be present
in the fractal hierarchy of light cones. At all levels of the hierarchy all contribution from upper
boundary of the causal diamond to the conscious experience would come from boundary of same
past directed light-cone so that the conscious experience would be sharply localized in time in
the manner as we know it to be. The new element would be that content of conscious experience
would come from arbitrarily large region of Universe and seing Milky Way would mean direct
sensory contact with it.
5. These assumptions relate the hierarchy of quantum jumps to p-adic hierarchy. One can also
include also dark matter hierarchy into the picture. For dark matter hierarchy the time scale
hierarchy {Tn} is scaled by the factor r = ℏ/ℏ0 which can be also rational number. For r = 2k
the hierarchy of causal diamonds generalizes without diﬃculty and there is a kind of resonance
involved which might relate to the fact that the model of EEG favors the values of k = 11n,
where k = 11 also corresponds in good approximation to proton-electron mass ratio. For more
general values of ℏ/ℏ0 the generalization is possible assuming that the position of the upper tip
of causal diamond is chosen in such a manner that their positions are always the same whereas
the position of the lower light-cone boundary would correspond to {rTn} for given value of
Planck constant. Geometrically this picture generalizes the original idea about fractal hierarchy
of quantum jumps so that it contains both p-adic hierarchy and hierarchy of Planck constants.
The contributions from lower the boundaries identiﬁable in terms of memories would correspond to
diﬀerent time scales and for a given value of time scale T the net contribution to conscious experience
would be much weaker than the sensory input in general. The asymmetry between geometric now
and geometric past would be present for all contributions to conscious experience, not only sensory
ones. What is nice that the contents of conscious experience would rather literally come from the
boundary of the past directed light-cone along which the classical signals arrive. Hence the mystic
feeling about telepathic connection with a distant object at distance of billions of light years expressed
by an astrophysicist, whose name I have unfortunately forgotten, would not be romantic self deception.
This framework explains also the sharp distinction between geometric future and past (not surpris-
ingly since energy and time are dual): this distinction has also been a long standing problem of TGD
inspired theory of consciousness. Precognition is not possible unless one assumes that communications
and sharing of mental images between selves inside disjoint causal diamonds is possible. Physically
there seems to be no good reason to exclude the interaction between zero energy states associated
with disjoint causal diamonds.

2.2. TGD inspired theory of consciousness
57
The mathematical formulation of this intuition is however a non-trivial challenge and can be used
to articulate more precisely the views about what conﬁguration space and conﬁguration space spinor
ﬁelds actually are mathematically.
1. Suppose that the causal diamonds with tips at diﬀerent points of H = M 4 ×CP2 and character-
ized by distance between tips T deﬁne sectors CHi of the full conﬁguration space CH (”world
of classical worlds”). Precognition would represent an interaction between zero energy states
associated with diﬀerent sectors CHi in this scheme and tensor factor description is required.
2. Inside given sector CHi it is not possible to speak about second quantization since every quantum
state correspond to a single mode of a classical spinor ﬁeld deﬁned in that sector.
3. The question is thus whether the Cliﬀord algebras and zero energy states associated with diﬀerent
sectors CHi combine to form a tensor product so that these zero energy states can interact.
Tensor product is required by the vision about zero energy insertions assignable to CHi which
correspond to causal diamonds inside causal diamonds. Also the assumption that zero energy
states form an ensemble in 4-D sense - crucial for the deduction of scattering rates from M-matrix
- requires tensor product.
4. The argument unifying the two deﬁnitions of self requires that the tensor product is restricted
when CHi correspond to causal diamonds inside each other. The tensor factors in shorter time
scales are restricted to the causal diamonds hanging from a light-like radial ray at the upper end
of the common past directed light-cone. If the causal diamonds are disjoint there is no obvious
restriction to be posed, and this would mean the possibility of also precognition and sharing of
mental images.
This scenario allows also to answers the questions related to a more precise deﬁnition of volume of
attention. Causal diamond - or rather - the associated light-like boundaries containing positive and
negative energy states deﬁne the primitive volume of attention. The obvious question whether the
attention of a given self is doomed to be ﬁxed to a ﬁxed volume can be also answered. This is not
the case. Selves can delocalize in the sense that there is a wave function associated with the position
of the causal diamond and quantum jumps changing this position are possible. Also many-particle
states assignable to a union of several causal diamonds are possible. Note that the identiﬁcation of
magnetic ﬂux tubes as space-time correlates of directed attention in TGD inspired quantum biology
makes sense if these ﬂux tubes connect diﬀerent causal diamonds. The directedness of attention in
this sense should be also understood: it could be induced from the ordering of p-adic primes and
Planck constant: directed attention would be always from longer to shorter scale.
Does sleep state involve a loss of consciousness?
The ability to avoid entropic entanglement with environment is essential for the original notion of
self and in the case of sub-selves it would explain the ﬁnite life-time of mental images. Algebraic
entanglement can be however negentropic and the idea that its generation does not lead to a loss of
consciousness is attractive. If sleep really means a loss of consciousness it must lead to a generation of
entropic entanglement. But does this really happen? Could sleep only lead to a loss of consciousness at
those levels of self hiererachy responsible for conscious memories, which correspond to mental images
and thus sub-CDs located in those space-time regions of CD, where the sleeping occurs?
Is the assumption about the loss of consciousness during sleep really necessary? Can one imagine
good reasons for why we should remain conscious during sleep?
1. One could argue that if consciousness is really lost during sleep, we could not have the deep
conviction that we existed yesterday.
2. Second argument is based on the assumption that brains are acting as topological quantum com-
puters during sleep. During an ideal topological quantum computation the entanglement with
the surrounding world is absent and thus topological quantum computation should correspond
to a conscious experience with a vanishing entanglement entropy. Night time is the best time for
topological quantum computation since sensory input and motor action do not take metabolic
resources and we certainly do problem solving during sleep. Thus we should be conscious at

58
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
some level during sleep and perform quite a long topological quantum computation. The prob-
lem with this argument is that the ideal topological quantum computation could be performed
by a larger system than brain so that ability to perform topological quantum computation does
not allow to conclude whether we are conscious during sleep or not. In fact, the idea that large
number of brains entangle to a larger unit giving rise to a stereo consciousness about what it
is to be human besides performing topological quantum computation like processes, is rather
attractive.
Could it then be that we do not remember anything about the period of sleep because our attention
is directed elsewhere and memory recall uses only copies of ”me” assignable to brain manufacturing
standardized mental images?
Perhaps the communication link to the mental images during sleep
experienced at dark matter levels of existence is lacking or sensory input and motor activities of busy
westeners do not allow to use metabolic energy to build up this kind of communications. Hence one
can at least half-seriously ask, whether self is actually eternal with respect to the subjective time and
whether entangling with some system means only diving into the ocean of consciousness as someone
has expressed it. Could we be Gods as also quantum classical correspondence in the reverse direction
suggests (p-adic cognitive space-time sheets have literally inﬁnite size in both temporal and spatial
directions)?
2.3
Quantum information processing in living matter
The notion of magnetic body leads to a dramatic modiﬁcation of the views about functions of brain. In
the following the discussion the the new vision about life as number theoretically critical phenomenon
is not discussed separately.
2.3.1
Magnetic body as intentional agent and experiencer
In TGD Universe brain would be basically a builder of symbolic representations assigning a meaning to
the sensory input by decomposing sensory ﬁeld to objects and making possible eﬀective motor control
by magnetic body containing dark matter. A concrete model for how magnetic controls biological
body and receives information from it is discussed in the model for the hierarchy of EEGs [K21] .
Also magnetic body could have sensory qualia, which should be in a well-deﬁned sense more reﬁned
than ordinary sensory qualia [K28] . The quantum number increments associated with cyclotron phase
transitions of dark ion cyclotron condensates at magnetic body could correspond to emotional and
cognitive content of sensory input and would indeed have interpretation as higher level sensory qualia.
Right brain sings – left brain talks metaphor would characterize this emotional-cognitive distinction
for higher level qualia and would correspond to coding of sensory input from brain by frequency
patterns resp. temporal patterns (analogs of phonemes). These qualia would be somatosensory qualia
at the level of magnetic body.
Remote mental interactions between magnetic body and biological body are a key element of this
picture. Remote mental interactions in the usual sense of the world would occur between magnetic
body and some other, not necessary biological, body. This would include receival of sensory input
from and motor control of other than own body. Also ”dead” matter possesses magnetic bodies so that
also psychokinesis would be based on the same mechanism. Magnetic body for which dissipation is
much smaller than for ordinary matter (proportional to 1/ℏ, would presumably continue its conscious
existence after biological death and ﬁnd another biological body and use it as a tool of sensory
perception and intentional action.
2.3.2
Summary about the possible role of the magnetic body in living
matter
The notion of magnetic/ﬁeld body is probably the feature of TGD inspired theory of quantum biology
which creates strongest irritation in standard model physicist. A ridicule as some kind of Mesmerism
might be the probable reaction. The notion of magnetic/ﬁeld body has however gradually gained
more and more support and it is now an essential element of TGD based view about living matter. In
the following I list the basic applications in the hope that the overall coherency of the picture might

2.3. Quantum information processing in living matter
59
force some readers to take this notion seriously. I will talk only about magnetic body although it is
clear that ﬁeld body has also electric parts as well as radiative parts realized in terms of ”massless
extremals” or topological light rays.
In the following discussion the possible implications of the idea that living matter resides in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds is not taken into account. An attractive working hypothesis is
that negentropic entanglement can be assigned to the magnetic bodies. For instance, the ends of the
magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting (say) biomolecules could be entangled negentropically. This idea has
been already applied to explain the stability of high energy phosphate bond and of DNA polymers,
which are highly charged [K26] .
Anatomy of magnetic body
Consider ﬁrst the anatomy of the magnetic body.
1. Magnetic body has a fractal onion like structure with decreasing magnetic ﬁeld strengths and
the highest layers can have astrophysical sizes. Cyclotron wave length gives an estimate for the
size of particular layer of magnetic body. B = .2 Gauss is the ﬁeld strength associated with a
particular layer of the magnetic body assignable to vertebrates and EEG. This value is not the
same as the nominal value of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld equal to .5 Gauss. It is quite possible
that the ﬂux quanta of the magnetic body correspond to those of wormhole magnetic ﬁeld and
thus consist of two parallel ﬂux quanta which have opposite time orientation. This is true for
ﬂux tubes assigned to DNA in the model of DNA as a topological quantum computer.
2. The layers of the magnetic body are characterized by the values of Planck constant and the
matter at the ﬂux quanta can be interpreted as macroscopically quantum coherent dark matter.
This picture makes sense only if one accepts the generalization of the notion of imbedding space.
3. In the case of wormhole magnetic ﬁelds it is natural to assign a deﬁnite temporal duration to
the ﬂux quanta and the time scales deﬁned by EEG frequencies are natural. In particular, the
inherent time scale .1 seconds assignable to electron as a duration of zero energy space-time sheet
having positive and negative energy electron at its ends would correspond to 10 Hz cyclotron
frequency for ordinary value of Planck constant. For larger values of Planck constants the time
scale scales as ℏ. Quite generally, a connection between p-adic time scales of EEG and those of
electron and lightest quarks is highly suggestive since light quarks play key role in the model of
DNA as topological quantum computer.
4. TGD predicts also hierarchy of scaled variants of electro-weak and color physics so that ZXG,
QXG, and GXG corresponding to Z0 boson, W boson, and gluons appearing eﬀectively as
massless particles below some biologically relevant length scale suggest themselves. In this phase
quarks and gluons are unconﬁned and electroweak symmetries are unbroken so that gluons, weak
bosons, quarks and even neutrinos might be relevant to the understanding of living matter. In
particular, long ranged entanglement in charge and color degrees of freedom becomes possible.
For instance, TGD based model of atomic nucleus as nuclear string suggests that biologically
important fermionic could be actually chemically equivalent bosons and form cyclotron Bose-
Einstein condensates.
Functions of the magnetic body
The list of possible functions of the magnetic body is already now rather impressive.
1. Magnetic body controls biological body and receives sensory data from it. Together with zero
energy ontology and new view about time explains Libet’s strange ﬁndings about time lapses
of consciousness. EEG, or actually fractal hierarchy of EXGs assignable to various body parts
makes possible communications to and control by the various layers of the magnetic body. WXG
could induce charge density gradients by the exchange of W boson.
2. The ﬂux sheets of the magnetic body traverse through DNA strands. The hierarchy of Planck
constants and quantization of magnetic ﬂux predicts that the ﬂux sheets can have arbitrarily
large width. This leads to the idea that there is hierarchy of genomes corresponding to ordinary

60
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
genome, supergenome consisting of genomes of several cell nuclei arranged along ﬂux sheet like
lines of text, and hypergenomes involving genomes of several organisms arranged in a similar
manner. The prediction is coherent gene expression at the level of organ, and even of population.
In this picture the big jumps in evolution, in particular, the emergence of EEG, could be seen as
the emergence of a new larger layer of magnetic body characterized by a larger value of Planck
constant. For instance, this would allow to understand why the quantal eﬀects of ELF em ﬁelds
requiring so large value of Planck constant that cyclotron energies are above thermal energy at
body temperature are observed for vertebrates only.
3. Magnetic body makes possible information process in a manner highly analogous to topological
quantum computation. The model of DNA as topological quantum computer assumes that ﬂux
tubes of wormhole magnetic ﬁeld connect DNA nucleotides with the lipids of the lipid layer
of nuclear or cell membrane. The ﬂux tubes would continue through the membrane and split
during topological quantum computation. The time-like braiding of ﬂux tubes makes possible
topological quantum computation via timelike braiding and space-like braiding makes possible
the representation of memories. The model allows general vision about the deeper meaning of
the structure of cell and makes testable predictions about DNA.
One prediction is the coloring of braid strands realized by an association of quark or antiquark
to nucleotide. Color and spin of quarks and antiquarks would thus correspond to the quantum
numbers assignable to braid ends. Color isospin could replace ordinary spin as a representation of
qubit and quarks would naturally give rise to qutrit, with third quark would have interpretation
as unspeciﬁed truth value. Fractionization of these quantum numbers takes place which increases
the number of degrees of freedom.
This prediction would relate closely to the discovery of
topologist Barbara Shipman that the model for the honeybee dance suggests that quarks are
in some manner involved with cognition. Also microtubules associated with axons connected
to a space-time sheet outside axonal membrane via lipids could be involved with topological
quantum computation and actually deﬁne an analog of a higher level programming language.
4. The strange ﬁndings about the behavior of cell membrane, in particular the ﬁnding that metabolic
deprivation does not lead to the death of cell, the discovery that ionic currents through the cell
membrane are quantal, and that these currents are essentially similar than those through an
artiﬁcial membrane, suggest that the ionic currents are dark ionic Josephson currents along mag-
netic ﬂux tubes. A high percent of biological ions would be dark and ionic channels and pumps
would be responsible only for the control of the ﬂow of ordinary ions through cell membrane.
5. These ﬁndings together with the discovery that also nerve pulse seems to involve only low
dissipation lead to a model of nerve pulse in which dark ionic currents automatically return
back as Josephson currents without any need for pumping. This does not exclude the possibility
that ionic channels might be involved with the generation of nerve pulse so that the original view
about quantal currents as controllers of the generation of nerve pulse would be turned upside
down.
Nerve pulse would result as a perturbation of kHz soliton sequence mathematically
equivalent to a situation in which a sequence of gravitational penduli rotates with constant
phase diﬀerence between neighbors except for one pendulum which oscillates and oscillation
moves along the sequence with the same velocity as the kHz wave. The oscillation would be
induced by a ”kick” for which one can imagine several mechanisms.
The model explains features of nerve pulse not explained by Hodkin-Huxley model.
These
include the mechanical changes associated with axon during nerve pulse, the outwards force
generated by nerve pulse with a correct prediction for its order of magnitude, the adiabatic
character of nerve pulse, and the small rise of temperature of membrane during pulse followed
by a reduction slightly below the original temperature.
The model predicts that the time taken to travel along any axon is a multiple of time dictated
by the resting potential so that synchronization is an automatic prediction. Not only kHz waves
but also a fractal hierarchy of EEG (and EXG) waves are induced as Josephson radiation by
voltage waves along axons and microtubules and by standing waves assignable to neuronal (cell)
soma. The value of Planck constant involved with ﬂux tubes determines the frequency scale of
EXG so that a fractal hierarchy results.

2.3. Quantum information processing in living matter
61
The model forces to challenge the existing interpretation of nerve pulse patterns and the function
of neural transmitters. Neural transmitters need not represent actual/only) signal but could be
more analogous to links in quantum web. The transmitter would coding the address of the
receiver, which could be gene inside neuronal nucleus. Nerve pulses would build a connection
line between sender and receiver of nerve pulse along which actual signals would propagate. Also
quantum entanglement between receiver and sender can be considered.
6. Acupuncture points, meridians, and Chi are key notions of Eastern medicine and ﬁnd a natural
identiﬁcation in terms of magnetic body lacking from the western medicine. Also a connection
with well established notions of DC currents and potentials discovered by Becker and with TGD
based view about universal metabolic currencies as diﬀerences of zero point energies for pairs of
space-time sheets with diﬀerent p-adic length scale emerges.
Chi would correspond to these fundamental metabolic energy quanta to which ordinary chemi-
cally stored metabolic energy would be transformed. Meridians would most naturally correspond
to ﬂux tubes with large ℏalong which dark supra currents ﬂow without dissipation and transfer
the metabolic energy between distant cells. Acupuncture points would correspond to points
between which metabolic energy is transferred and their high conductivity and semiconductor
like behavior would conform with the interpretation in terms of metabolic energy storages. The
energy gained in the potential diﬀerence between the points would help to kick the charge carrier
to a smaller space-time sheet. It is possible that the main contribution to the of charge at mag-
netic ﬂux tube is magnetic energy and slightly below the metabolic energy quantum and that
the voltage diﬀerence gives only the lacking small energy increment making the transfer possible.
Also direct kicking of charge carriers to smaller space-time sheets by photons is possible and
the observed action spectrum for IR and red photons corresponds to the predicted increments
of zero point kinetic energies.
7. Magnetic ﬂux tubes could also play key role in bio-catalysis and explain the magic ability of
biomolecules to ﬁnd each other. The model of DNA as topological quantum computer [K23] sug-
gest that not only DNA and its conjugate but also some amino-acid sequences acting as catalysts
could be connected to DNA and other amino-acids sequences or more general biomolecules by
ﬂux tubes acting as colored braid strands. The shortening of the ﬂux tubes in a phase transition
reducing the value of Planck constant would make possible extremely selective mechanisms of
catalysis allowing precisely deﬁned locations of reacting molecules to attach to each other. With
recently discovered mechanism for programming sequences of biochemical reactions this would
make possible to understand the miraculous looking feats of bio-catalysis.
8. The ability to construct ”stories”, temporally scaled down or possible also scaled up represen-
tations about the dynamical processes of external world, might be one of the key aspects of
intelligence. There is direct empirical evidence for this activity in hippocampus. The phase
transitions reducing or increasing the value of Planck constant would indeed allow to achieve
this by scaling the time duration of the zero energy space-time sheets providing cognitive repre-
sentations.
Direct experimental evidence for the notion of magnetic body carrying dark matter
The list of nice things made possible by the magnetic body is impressive and one can ask whether
there is any experimental support for this notion. The ﬁndings of Peter Gariaev and collaborators
give evidence for the representation of DNA sequences based on the coding of nucleotide to a rotation
angle of the polarization direction as photon travels through the ﬂux tube and for the decoding of
this representation to gene activation [I17] , for the transformation of laser light to light at various
radio-wave frequencies having interpretation in terms of phase transitions increasing ℏ[I16, I1] , and
even for the possibility to photograph magnetic ﬂux tubes containing dark matter by using ordinary
light in UV-IR range scattered from DNA [I30] .
2.3.3
Brain and consciousness
In the proposed vision the role of brain for consciousness is not so central than in neuroscience view.
Brain is not the seat of sensory mental images but builder of symbolic representations and magnetic

62
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
body replaces brain as an intentional agent and higher level experiencer. Furthermore, p-adic view
about cognition means that only cognitive representations but not cognition itself can be localized in
a ﬁnite space-time region.
The simplest sensory qualia would be realized at the level of sensory organs so that one can avoid
the problematic assignment of sensory qualia to the sensory pathways. The new view about time would
allow to resolve the objections against this view. For instance, phantom leg phenomenon would result
by sharing of sensory mental images of the geometric past by time like quantum entanglement. For
instance, visual colors would correspond to increments of color quantum numbers in quantum jumps
at the level of retina. Our sensory mental images do not correspond to the sensory input as such.
Rather, the feedback from brain (or from magnetic body via brain) to sensory organs is an essential
element in the construction of sensory mental images. For instance, during REM sleep rapid eye
movements would reﬂect the presence of this feedback. The feedback would be also very important in
the case of hearing. Visual mental images in absence of eye movements could be interpreted as sharing
of visual mental images by quantum entanglement (in particular, time-like entanglement giving rise
to episodal memories).
2.4
Time and consciousness
The questions related to the notion of time have turned out to be the most diﬃcult ones encountered
during the evolution of TGD inspired theory of consciousness, and the original naive vision has very
little. Mention only zero energy ontology, hierarchy of Planck constants and dark matter, time-like
entanglement and negentropic entanglement, p-adic as physics of intentionality and cognition, and
the notion of magnetic body. It is certainly too early to claim that everything is understood but it
seems that no dramatic changes in the overall picture are to be expected anymore.
2.4.1
The relationship between subjective and geometric time
The relationship between experienced time and geometric time has been one of the long-standing
problems of TGD inspired theory of conscousness and I have made several proposals about this
relationship. The basic questions are however obvious. What gives rise to the arrow of geometric time
in various senses (at imbedding space level and at space-time level)? Why the contents of sensory
experience are about so narrow time interval? Why also the intentional actions at least apparently is
restricted to such a narrow time interval? Quantum classical correspondence predicts that the arrow
of subjective time is somehow mapped to that for the geometric time. The detailed mechanism for
how the arrow of psychological time emerges has however remained open. Also the notion of self is
problematic.
Two times
The notion of quantum jump implies a new view about time. Experienced/subjective time corresponds
to a sequence of sub-quantum jumps and cannot be identiﬁed with the geometric time deﬁned as the
fourth space-time coordinate. This is of course obvious for anyone: consider only the reversibility of
geometric time contra irreversibility of experienced time, and the fact that both geometric past and
future exist whereas only subjective past exists. The fact that the contents of conscious experience
is about 4-D rather than 3-D space-time region, motivates the notions of 4-D brain, body, and even
society. In particular, conscious existence continues after biological death since 4-D body and brain
continue to exist.
Two earlier views about how the arrow of psychological time emerges
The basic question how the arrow of subjective time is mapped to that of geometric time.
The
common assumption of all models is that quantum jump sequence corresponds to evolution and that
by quantum classical correspondence this evolution must have a correlate at space-time level so that
each quantum jump replaces typical space-time surface with a more evolved one.
1. The earliest model assumes that the space-time sheet assignable to observer (”self”) drifts along
a larger space-time sheet towards geometric future quantum jump by quantum jump: this is

2.4. Time and consciousness
63
like driving car in a landscape but in the direction of geometric time and seeing the changing
landscape. There are several objections.
i) Why this drifting?
ii) If one has a large number of space-time sheets (the number is actually inﬁnite) as one has in
the hierarchy the drifting velocity of the smallest space-time sheet with respect to the largest
one can be arbitrarily large (inﬁnite).
iii) It is alarming that the evolution of the background space-time sheet by quantum jumps,
which must be the quintessence of quantum classical correspondence, is not needed at all in the
model.
2. Second model relies on the idea that intentional action -understood as p-adic-to-real phase
transition for space-time sheets and generating zero energy states and corresponding real space-
time sheets - proceeds as a kind of wave front towards geometric future quantum jump by
quantum jump. Also sensory input would be concentrated on this kind of wave front. The
diﬃcult problem is to understand why the contents of sensory input and intentional action are
localized so strongly to this wave front and rather than coming from entire life cycle.
There are also other models but these two are the ones which represent basic types for them.
The third option
The third explanation for the arrow of psychological time - which I have considered earlier but only
half-seriously - looks to me the most elegant at this moment.
This option is actually favored by
Occam’s razor since it uses only the assumption that space-time sheets are replaced by more evolved
ones in each quantum jump. Also the model of tqc favors it.
1. In standard picture the attention would gradually shift towards geometric future and space-
time in 4-D sense would remain ﬁxed. Now however the fact that quantum state is quantum
superposition of space-time surfaces allows to assume that the attention of the conscious observer
is directed to a ﬁxed volume of 8-D imbedding space.
Quantum classical correspondence is
achieved if the evolution in a reasonable approximation means shifting of the space-time sheets
and corresponding ﬁeld patterns backwards backwards in geometric time by some amount per
quantum jump so that the perceiver ﬁnds the geometric future in 4-D sense to enter to the
perceptive ﬁeld. This makes sense since the shift with respect to M 4 time coordinate is an exact
symmetry of extremals of K¨ahler action. It is also an excellent approximate symmetry for the
preferred extremals of K¨ahler action and thus for maxima of K¨ahler function spoiled only by the
presence of light-cone boundaries. This shift occurs for both the space-time sheet that perceiver
identiﬁes itself and perceived space-time sheet representing external world: both perceiver and
percept change.
2. Both the landscape and observer space-time sheet remain in the same position in imbedding
space but both are modiﬁed by this shift in each quantum jump. The perceiver experiences this
as a motion in 4-D landscape. Perceiver (Mohammed) would not drift to the geometric future
(the mountain) but geometric future (the mountain) would eﬀectively come to the perceiver
(Mohammed)!
3. There is an obvious analogy with Turing machine: what is however new is that the tape eﬀectively
comes from the geometric future and Turing machine can modify the entire incoming tape by
intentional action. This analogy might be more than accidental and could provide a model for
quantum Turing machine operating in TGD Universe. This Turing machine would be able to
change its own program as a whole by using the outcomes of the computation already performed.
4. The concentration of the sensory input and the eﬀects of conscious motor action to a narrow
interval of time (.1 seconds typically, secondary p-adic time scale associated with the largest
Mersenne M127 deﬁning p-adic length scale which is not completely super-astronomical) can be
understood as a concentration of sensory/motor attention to an interval with this duration: the
space-time sheet representing sensory ”me” would have this temporal length and ”me” deﬁnitely
corresponds to a zero energy state.

64
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
5. The fractal view about topological quantum computation strongly suggests an ensemble of al-
most copies of sensory ”me” scattered along my entire life cycle and each of them experiencing
my life as a separate almost copy.
6. The model of geometric and subjective memories would not be modiﬁed in an essential manner:
memories would result when ”me” is connected with my almost copy in the geometric past by
braid strands or massless extremals (MEs) or their combinations (ME parallel to magnetic ﬂux
tube is the analog of Alfwen wave in TGD).
This argument leaves many questions open.
What is the precise deﬁnition for the volume of
attention? Is the attention of self doomed to be directed to a ﬁxed volume or can quantum jumps
change the volume of attention? What distinguishes between geometric future and past as far as
contents of conscious experience are considered? How this picture relates to p-adic and dark matter
hierarchies? Does this framework allow to formulate more precisely the notion of self? Zero energy
ontology allows to give tentative answers to these questions.
Can one assign to quantum jump a chronon of geometric time?
Whatever the mechanism correlating the subjective time with geometric time and giving rise to the
arrow of geometric timeis, one can ask following kind of questions. Does it make sense to assign a
geometric time interval to the quantum jump in statistical sense? Is this interval always the same or
does one have a hierarchy of geometric durations for the moment of consciousness.
1. The original guess was that the average increment of the psychological time in a single quantum
jump does not depend on properties of the self and is of the order of CP2 time about 104 Planck
times. This would mean that consciousness in biological length scales is in a well deﬁned sense
macroscopic phenomenon and that single quantum jump corresponds to a microscopic building
block of self.
A natural assumption is that self hierarchy starts already from selves having
duration of few quantum jumps (elementary particles?).
This vision does not explain convincingly the integration of the moments of consciousness to
larger units which resembles formation of bound states to a high degree.
In particular, the
geometric duration of quantum jump is very much analogous to decoherence time, and it is
diﬃcult to understand how Schr¨odinger equation can make sense if the decoherence time is of
order CP2 time.
2. Zero energy and number theoretic vision encourage to ask whether the generation of -possibly
negentropic- time-like entanglement between positive and negative energy parts of zero energy
states could be the analog of bound state formation guaranteing that subself would not reduce
to an unentangled pair of positive and negative energy states in concomitant quantum jumps
but is more analogous to a quantum system obeying a unitary time evolution.
The hierarchy CDs deﬁning a hierarchy of p-adic length scales and associated dark matter
matter hierarchy suggest that there is a fractal hierarchy of quantum jumps such that quantum
jumps at the lower level of hierarchy integrate to higher level quantum jumps and in this manner
give rise to the experience about ﬂow of time at the higher levels. This would suggest that the
geometric duration assigned to single quantum jump for CD with temporal size scale Tk ∝2k
corresponds to geometric time interval Tk and that it corresponds to to 2n quantum jumps at
the lower level k −n with geometric time interval Tk−n. For this option CP2 time would deﬁne
the smallest chronon of geometric time.
What is intriguing that for electron that time scale Tk corresponds to k = 127 and is .1 seconds
deﬁning the fundamental 10 Hz bio-rhythm. One can indeed say that the chronon of sensory
experience is .1 seconds.
For u and d quarks with mass around 5 MeV the corresponding
time scale would correspond to k = 120 and millisecond time scale assignable to kHz cortical
synchrony and duration of nerve pulse.
The new concept of the psychological time means a dramatic generalization of the standard view
about subjective existence. Mindlike space-time sheets -or CD about which I prefer to talk now- are
distributed everywhere and all of them can participate in quantum jumsp. Therefore one can say that
the entire space-time is a conscious, living being. Civilizations of the geometric past and future exist

2.4. Time and consciousness
65
simultaneously with us. We are members of a four-dimensional society in the sense that our actions
aﬀect the life of selves of both geometric past and future since each quantum jump performed by us
changes the macroscopic space-time in both past and future. It is quite possible that there are new
versions of me in the geometric past represented by mindlike space-time sheets drifting in future time
direction along the material space-time sheet describing ”material me”. Therefore this particular life
of mine is only one among very many ones. p-Adic evolution implies that in the statistical sense the
quality of these lives tends to get better. We in our youth now experience in slightly more deeper
manner and live in a society having
2.4.2
Four-dimensional brain and long term memories
Four-dimensionality of brain is crucial for the understanding long term memories as multitime expe-
riences receiving contributions from several moments of geometric time. This identiﬁcation makes it
unnecessary to have any memory storage mechanisms. Rather, the activities of the memory circuits
can be seen as increasing the probability that memory recall occurs. Reverberating memory circuits in
which experience is echoed indeed do this by extending the deep memory valley in spin glass landscape
to a long canyon in time direction. This increases the probability that mindlike space-time sheets enter
in the region of four-dimensional spin glass landscape representing the memory. The deepness of the
spin glass valley correlates with the emotionality of the memory. Childhood memories are especially
emotional and therefore stable. Memories are result of creative action and memory circuit involving
hippocampus seem to be active in carving out the art works representing geometric memories worth
of remembering. TGD based approach solves the basic problems of the neural net approach resulting
from the fact that the formation of new memories destroys old memories and from the fact that it is
diﬃcult to understand how the component of experience is known to be a memory.
Long term memories and memories in general can be understood as resulting from a very simple
mechanism. When I remember something that happened, say two years ago, I look at a mirror at
distance of one light year and see myself in mirror as I am at a distance of two geometric years in
the geometric past. Massless extremals (MEs) representing topological light (and graviton) rays and
carrying the classical information about the memory are reﬂected in some kind of a mirror structure.
Mirrors could correspond end points, branching points, curved parts or cross sections of magnetic ﬂux
tubes and MEs or in case of gravitonic rays to curved parts of the background spatetime surface.
The reﬂected ME could be seen as topological counterpart of self-energy diagram involving emission
and absorption of massless virtual particle such photon or graviton. At quantum level timelike entan-
glement, which is possible by the non-determinism of the fundamental variational principle, binds the
mental images ’now’ and ’then’ to a single mental image. MEs could be generated in the transitions
between almost degenerate quantum spin glass states. Since the energy diﬀerence corresponds to the
classical gravitational energy, topological gravitonic rays, which also interact very weakly with the
external world, are good candidates for MEs responsible for long term memories. The interpretation
of these MEs as gravitonic 1/f noise suggest itsef strongly.
Note that the continual occurrence of quantum jumps between quantum histories explains why
our long term memories are unstable. It seems however that it is probably only sensory and cog-
nitive representations which are altered appreciabely. In human time scales geometric past should
be relatively stable in macroscopic length scales: otherwise dramatic changes of the recent reality
induced by macroscopic quantum jumps in the geometric past would occur. Four-dimensional brain
provides a completely new view about how gemeralized sensory experiences are generated, how gen-
eralized motor actions are planned and how memories are constructed. This process is like creating
an artwork. Four-dimensional spin glass landscape representing a rough scetch is gradually reﬁned by
adding details and corrections in increasingly shorter time scales: this corresponds to neural activities
of four-dimensional brain generating motion leading to the desired part of spin glass energy landscape.
This picture is consistent with the observed 1/f noise and fractality of nerve pulse patterns. Abso-
lutely essential is self-organization and related dissipation forcing the Darwinian selection leading to
end product which is charicature rather than photo.

Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
Do declarative memories and intentional action involve communications with geometric
past?
Communications with geometric past using time mirror mechanism in which phase conjugate photons
propagating to the geometric past are reﬂected back as ordinary photons (typically dark photons with
energies above thermal threshold) make possible realization of declarative memories in the brain of
the geometric past [K66] .
This mechanism makes also possible realization of intentional actions as a process proceeding from
longer to shorter time scales and inducing the desired action already in geometric past. This kind
of realization would make living systems extremely ﬂexible and able to react instantaneously to the
changes in the environment. This model explains Libet’s puzzling ﬁnding that neural activity seems
to precede volition [J76] .
Also a mechanism of remote metabolism (”quantum credit card”) based on sending of negative
energy signals to geometric past becomes possible [K35] : this signal could also serve as a mere control
signal inducing much larger positive energy ﬂow from the geometric past. For instance, population
inverted system in the geometric past could allow this kind of mechanism. Remote metabolism could
also have technological implications.
Episodal memories as time-like entanglement
Time-like entanglement explains episodal memories as sharing of mental images with the brain of
geometric past [K66] .
An essential element is the notion of magnetic body which serves as an
intentional agent ”looking” the brain of geometric past by allowing phase conjugate dark photons
with negative energies to reﬂect from it as ordinary photons. The ﬁndings of Libet about time delays
related to the passive aspects of consciousness [J56] support the view that the part of the magnetic
body corresponding to EEG time scale has same size scale as Earth’s magnetosphere. The unavoidable
conclusion would be that our ﬁeld/magnetic bodies contain layers with astrophysical sizes.
p-Adic length scale hierarchy and number theoretically preferred hierarchy of values of Planck
constants, when combined with the condition that the frequencies f of photons involved with the
communications in time scale T satisfy the condition f ∼1/T and have energies above thermal
energy, lead to rather stringent predictions for the time scales of long term memory. The model for
the hierarchy of EEGs relies on the assumption that these time scales come as powers n = 211k,
k = 0, 1, 2,, and predicts that the time scale corresponding to the duration of human life cycle is ∼50
years and corresponds to k = 7 (amusingly, this corresponds to the highest level in chakra hierarchy).
2.4.3
Time and self
The proposed overall view leaves still open many questions about time and self.
What distinguishes ’now’ from memories and plans?
The new notion of psychological time leads to a very elegant mechanism of long term memory and
memories in general: to remember something at temporal distance T in the past is to look the past
brain from magnetic body from distance L = cT. This looking backwards in time could be realized
by sending a negative energy signal reﬂected back from the past brain as a positive energy signal. A
slightly more complex mechanism utilizes negative energy signal sent to the magnetic body at distance
L = cT/2, where it is reﬂected in ordinary sense to the brain of the past, where it suﬀers time-like
reﬂection and returns as a positive energy signal back to the brain along the same route. Also time-like
quantum entanglement is possible. In the simpler variant of time mirror mechanism the signal would
have fundamental frequency f = 1/T. These frequencies correspond to energies E = hf far below
the thermal threshold for the ordinary value of Planck constant but for large enough values ℏthe
problem can be circumvented. The quantal eﬀects of ELF em ﬁelds on brain support this proposal.
The conscious experience could in principle contain information from both the geometric past, from
the geometric now, and perhaps also from the geometric future (plans, dreams, expectations).
In zero energy ontology there is however an important delicacy involved. Is precognition really
possible if one assumes that the space-time sheets assigned to CD are restricted only to the interior
of CD? The cautious answer is Yes. CD is imbedded inside a larger CD and this CD could be

2.4. Time and consciousness
67
responsible for both precognition and for non-personal memories originating from the geometric past
not belonging to the CD of self.
If there are also space-time sheets which begin from the future (past) boundaries and continue
to ﬁture (past) precognition and memories extending beyond personal life are certainly plausible and
light-like 3-surfaces could at as correlates for time-like entanglement and communications of signals
reﬂected in time direction. For the generalization of Feynman diagrams this is assumed and sub-CDs
have at elementary particle level interpretation in terms of radiative corrections.
This asymmetry between interior and exterior of CD could be responsible for the dramatic dis-
tinctions between the conscious geometric now, memories, and plans and explain how the illusion
about reality as a time=constant snapshot of the geometric time development is created. Also the
asymmetry between geometric future and nearby geometric past could be understood. More precisely,
the proposed identiﬁcation of geometric now inspired by zero energy ontology would be in terms of
the mental images residing near the future boundary of CD associated with self. In case of electrons
these CDs would have size scale of .1 seconds corresponding to the duration of the moment of sensory
experience. The personal memories from the period of life-time would correspond to the interior of
CD associated with self. Transpersonal memories interpreted in terms of previous lives would corre-
spond to memories about geometric past outside CD. Precognitions would have information contents
coming from the geometric future outside CD of self.
Estimate for the ”wake-up time” of sensory selves time scale of causal diamonds
The basic question relates to the age of selves representing sensory mental images and also to the age
of our own self which at least apparently seems to be of order of our wake-up period. The question is
not trivial.
1. It is not at all clear whether the wake-up state is continuous: also our self could exist only a
fraction of time and memories could create the illusion about continuity of self.
2. Maximally entropic long-aged sub-selves in thermal equilibrium need not contribute to conscious
experience and their disappearance from our consciousness need not mean that they die: they
could simply give rise to a background sensory and cognitive noise which is certainly present.
The ﬁrst question is how to express this wake-up period in terms of geometric time. The model
for the arrow of geometric time based on zero energy ontology suggests that the temporal length of
space-time sheet (length of the ﬁlm representing movie running to the geometric past), which ﬂows
through the future boundary of CD of self during its wake-up period gives this measure.
1. The simplest dimensional analysis inspired guess would be that this time scale is the time scale
of CD assignable to self.
This guess could be defended also on basis of quantum classical
correspondence but remains still a guess. If sensory mental images indeed correspond to CDs
assignable to electrons, this guess looks sensible.
2. The fact that the entropy of an ageing sub-self tends to increase means that mental images get
fuzzy. This allows the possibility that our sensory mental images are rather quite long-lived
but get rapidly fuzzy so that only the youngest sensory mental images would dominate our
consciousness. One can imagine that the mental images created at the future boundary CD
drift to the direction of geometric past and get gradually more entropic. The memory feats of
synesthetes could provide one exception to this rule and have explanation in terms of long term
negentropic entanglement stabilizing the mental images. Large ℏcould be also involved.
3. One could also argue that the wake-up time for the CD assignable to my biological body is
same as my biological lifetime. Otherwise I would not know with such a certainty that I existed
yesterday. I would not lose totally my consciousness during sleep but would be only unable to
remember much about this period. It is known that dreams experienced during some period of
time form logical stories so that at least dreaming involves memories about previous dreams.
This argument looked excellent in the original formulation of the theory but ceases to be water
tight in zero energy ontology. Long term memories realized in terms of negative energy signals
and time-like entanglement could be enough to create this conviction.
There are also good
reasons to believe that scaled down variants of the memories compressing long time periods to

68
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
shorter time intervals are generated in terms of ℏreducing phase transitions: this would be
one manner to realize conscious holograms. These fractal stories about my life could create the
conviction that I existed yesterday.
There are also arguments supporting a short wake-up time.
1. The identiﬁcation of subjective memory as a short term memory and the fact that sensory
sub-selves with too long age cannot provide the needed time resolution of sensory experience
encourages the idea that sensory sub-selves have a short wake-up period of order .1 seconds.
Since sensory sub-selves seem to have ﬁnite wake-up time also our self should have.
2. The duration of short term memory seems to be of order second so that the periods of, at least,
sensory wake-up should be of order second. On the other hand, memory sub-selves of suﬃciently
short duration can give rise to sensory memory with suﬃcient resolution even if our self has much
longer wake-up period.
3. A good guess seems to be that the duration of our self is not longer than wake-up period. But
again it could be that I simply do not remember what we experience during sleep: to remember
what happened during sleep we must perhaps be in sleep state.
The time scale of .1 seconds assignable to electron’s CD corresponds to the time scale of EEG,
which also supports the interpretation of the size scale of CD as a duration of sensory mental image.
The currents generating EEG certainly create weak electromagnetic radiation ﬁelds which in TGD
framework correspond to topological ﬁeld quanta of Earth size. It is known that EEG frequencies are
in the same frequency range as so called Schumann frequencies [F4] associated with the resonances
of the electromagnetic ﬁelds in the 80 km thick wave cavity between Earth surface and ionosphere.
Magnetic perturbations near Schumann frequencies are known to have profound eﬀects on human brain
inducing altered states of consciousness and neural instabilities [J100] . Furthermore, the estimate
for the thickness of the magnetic ﬂux tubes of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld based on the quantization of
the magnetic ﬂux is about cell size. These observations raise the question whether our ”physical”
body is only a tip of an iceberg and formed by the topological condensation of the biomatter around
electromagnetic topological ﬁeld quanta serving as templates for the biostructures [K12] .
Our self hierarchy could contain also higher levels and the fact that we experience continuity of
personal existence suggests that this is the case. This consistent with the basic assumptions about
conscious experience if the temporal averaging involved with the temporal binding is weighted so that
only the most recent experiences are present with large weight. An interesting possibility is that entire
fractal hierarchy of magnetic ﬂux tube structures carrying superconducting BE condensates of ions is
involved so that also a hierarchy of cyclotron time scales deﬁning a hierarchy of durations for selves
(mental images) is involved. Same is true for MEs and Uncertainty Principle suggest that MEs with
size of order light life time are involved with our long term memories.
How fast subjective time runs?
An interesting challenge is to understand the relation of the subjectively experienced time to the
psychological time (essentially geometric time). In order to experience time self must have a clock.
The simplest assumption is that the sequence of quantum jumps deﬁnes the sequence of ticks for the
clock. Therefore subjective time would be measured as the number n of quantum jumps occurred
after the wake-up of the self. The rate for the running of subjective time would be dn/da and just
the inverse for the rate of running for psychological time and same for all systems if the average
duration of chronon is of order of CP2 time: this is certainly not consistent with the fact subjectively
experienced time can run faster or even stop. One could also kill this naive hypothesis by noticing
that self should be able to distinguish between the ticks of the clock: obviously we cannot experience
quantum jumps as separate events.
A more realistic model is based on the idea that the average time interval ∆a between two wake-ups
of a ’clock’ sub-self, which exists periodically in a wake-up state deﬁnes a natural unit of subjective
time. The number N of ticks for the clock is given by the age of self divided by the duration of single
wake-up period for the ’clock’ self
N(a) =
a
∆a .

2.4. Time and consciousness
69
N would naturally deﬁne a measure of subjectively experienced time. Slowing down of subjective
time would correspond to the slowing down of the internal clock in the sense that ∆a increases.
Consider now whether this simple model can explain basic facts about experienced rate of subjec-
tively experienced time.
1. Experienced time is said to run slowly, when we get bored and drowsy. Actually the situation
is just the opposite since the number of ticks of the internal clock per unit of psychological time
must be large. In order to understand what might be involved, assume that also the internal
clock gets drowsy so that the average wake-up period ∆aW for the internal clock gets shorter.
If internal clock wakes up spontaneously, one can assume that the average duration ∆aS for
the sleeping periods for clock self is not changed. Hence ∆= ∆aW + ∆aS is reduced so that
N(a) ∝1/∆a increases and geometric time is experienced as longer.
2. Quite diﬀerent situation is encountered, when person is in the state of whole-body-consciousness.
In this kind of situation there is no internal clock and one can indeed say that there is no time!
This would explain the reports of meditators about state of ’timelessness’ [J84] Oliver Sacks
has described in his book ’Awakenings’ patients who have lived for years in ’no-time’ state with
frozen contents of conscious experience, which presumably meant that everything in the external
world seemed to happen extremely slowly. It would be natural to assume that the lifetime ∆a
of the ’clock’ self was very long in this kind of situation or even that person was in the state of
whole-body-consciousness. The only clock is person itself and the entire experience corresponds
to single tick of this clock. There are also reports that when person is in dramatic situation like
traﬃc accident, time is experienced to stop. One explanation is that person experiences state
of whole-body consciousness. Second possibility is that in this kind of situation involving very
high level of alertness ∆a becomes very short so that all motions seem to occur very slowly: in
this manner person gets a lot of subjective time to react to the situation.
One could also try to understand why persons at older age feel that time runs faster. This statement
is clearly not about what person immediately experiences but impression about what has happened.
One possible explanation is however that the period ∆a of the internal clock indeed gets longer at
older age. This could be caused by the increase of the period ∆aS of the sleeping period of the internal
clock. This is consistent with the previous idea that the wake-up time of mental images gets shorter,
which also explains why old people experience that geometric time ﬂows faster. Thus, if the total
fraction of geometric time spend by the person and his/her sub-selves in wake-up state decreases when
person gets older, one can understand why the time is experienced to run faster at the older age.
Time delays of consciousness and other anomalies
TGD based concept of time has rather dramatic implications and it is important to show that the
new time concept indeed solves the conceptual problems and anomalies of the standard physics. One
should also device experiments to test the new time concept.
1. Dissipation is the black sheep in the family of theoretical physics and quantum jump between
quantum histories concept explains dissipation in an elegant manner.
The ad hoc addition
of various parameters characterizing dissipation to the reversible fundamental equations of the
classical physics can be understood as a phenomenological model for the subjective time evolution
as a sequence of macroscopic space-times deﬁned by the ﬁnal states of the quantum jumps.
Dissipative space-time is kind of an envelope for a sequence of non-dissipative space-times.
Dissipation is a signature of quantum jumps which, by the basic assumptions related to the
formulation of NMP, correspond to a sequence of quantum measurements and can occur only
inside selves.
Hence dissipation gives direct evidence for consciousness.
TGD predicts the
possibility of whole-body consciousness with anomalously low dissipation and this spectacular
eﬀect provides a test of TGD approach [K12] .
2. Quantum jumps between quantum histories concept together with the notion of self explains
also the peculiar time delays of consciousness revealed in the experiments [J80, J56] relating
to the active and passive roles of consciousness and described by Penrose in his book [J95] .
The basic observation is that quantum jump replaces macroscopic space-time with a new one

70
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
and that both the geometric past and future change. For instance, the EEG activity preceding
the conscious decision to raise the index ﬁnger in experiments of Libet related to the active
aspects of consciousness [J56] can be interpreted as classical electromagnetic ﬁelds present in
the geometric past of the new macroscopic space-time generated by the decision to raise the
ﬁnger.
3. It is also possible to explain the causal anomalies revealed by the experiments of Radin and
Bierman [J31, J32, J112] . In these experiences pictures with emotionally provocative content
generated galvanic skin responses already before they were seen. A natural looking assumption
about the contents of conscious experience is that the change of the geometric past is larger for
emotional than for non-emotional quantum jumps (e-motion!): this is also consistent with the
important role of emotion as a motivator and with the fact that neural transmitters involved
with the emotion induce long term synaptic changes. With this assumption the change of the
past recordings about galvanic skin response is predicted to be larger for the emotional pictures
than for the non-emotional ones. TGD predicts ”tribar eﬀect” as a general signature for the
quantum jump between quantum histories concept [K86] .
What after biological death?
One can also speculate about the course of events at the moment of death and after it. The outcome
depends strongly on the beliefs about how the arrow of psychological time emerges.
1. If the latest view based on zero energy ontology and on the identiﬁcation of causal diamond
(CD) as a correlate for self is accepted then time ﬂow corresponds to an eﬀective ﬂow of the
quantum superposition of space-time sheets assignable to self to the interior of CD through the
light-like future boundary of CD. This ﬂow would be induced by a volutional act stimulated
by the curiosity to see what is in the geometric future (the space-time sheet associated with
a larger CD perceived by self as environment). At the moment of biological death subselves
corresponding to sensory mental images would die. If the shifting continues to happen -perhaps
by the volition of larger selves of sub-selves- the biological death would propagate as a wave front
to the geometric past. After the death of sensory mental images and their symbolic counterparts
the mental images of geometric past would dominate the contents of consciousness but after the
wave front of biological death would have reached the lower boundary of CD, their contribution
to consciousness would cease. This does need not of course mean a loss of consciousness. Self
could be ready to direct its attention in a new manner.
One can represent an objection against this picture. If zero energy states correspond to constant
zero momentum plane waves in the degrees of freedom assignable to the center of mass of CD
it would seem that the experiences of self are kind of abstraction coming from the experiences
assignable to all these CDs. Does this really make sense? Maybe it does not make sense to
assign zero momentum to cm degrees of freedom of CD. If one does not perform this assignment
the self could redirect its attention to a CD at diﬀerent spatiotemporal position and with more
interesting external world.
2. In the earlier model for the arrow of geometric time space-time sheets drift to the geometric
future along larger space-time sheet. For this option this particular sensory ”me” would meet
the geometro-temporal boundary of the biological body: sensory input would cease and there
would be no biological body to use anymore. ”Me” might lose its consciousness (if it can!).
”Me” has also other mental images than sensory ones and these could begin to dominate the
consciousness and ”me” could direct its attention to space-time sheets corresponding to much
longer time scale, perhaps even to that of life cycle, giving a summary about the life.
What after that? The Tibetan Book of Dead gives some inspiration. A western ”me” might hope
(and even try use its intentional powers to guarantee) that quantum Turing tape sooner later brings
into the volume of attention (which might also change) a living organism, be it human or cat or dog
or at least some little bug. If this ”me” is lucky, it could direct its attention to it and become one
of the very many sensory ”me’s” populating this particular 4-D biological body. There would be
room for a newcomer unlike in the alternative models. A ”me” with Eastern/New-Ageish traits could
however direct its attention permanently to the dark space-time sheets and achieve what she might
call enlightment.

Various types of conscious experiences
In the following the general structure and classication of conscious experiences is discussed. Most
predictions are brain independent. Assuming that zero modes of the conﬁguration space, character-
izing the geometry of macroscopic classical space-time, determine the geometric information contents
of conscious experience and identifying macroscopic quantum phases as quantum correlates of various
sensory modalities, one can make rather far reaching predictions about basic aspects of, say, sensory
experience of any experiencer, be it human brain or some strange life form in distant galaxy.
2.5.1
Basic structure of conscious experience
Before continuing, it is perhaps useful to recall the basic anatomy of the quantum jump: Ψi →UΨi →
Ψf0 →....Ψf, where the ﬁnal quantum history Ψf is a superposition of space-time surfaces, which are
macroscopically equivalent and only bound state entanglement is present. Every space-time surface
of the superposition consists of parallel space-time sheets (connected by wormhole contacts). Some of
these space-time sheets have inﬁnite time extension and some have not. The latter ones are ’mindlike
space-time sheets’. One must make a clear distinction between the quantum superposition of the
space-time surfaces and the decomposition of the space-time surface to space-time sheets.
Real and imagined experiences
The assumption that p-adic physics is physics of imagination means division of qualia to real qualia
and imagined qualia. There are good arguments based on mathematical consistency that in p-adic
conﬁguration space degrees of freedom complete localization occurs in each quantum jump (see Ap-
pendix). This means that there are no quantum ﬂuctuations in p-adic degrees of freedom and since
non-geometric sensory qualia like color correspond to quantum number increments in quantum ﬂuc-
tuating degrees of freedom, there are no p-adic non-geometric qualia. This however leaves p-adic
geometric qualia determined by the increments of p-adic conﬁguration space coordinates. This view is
certainly consistent with intuitive notion that cognitive qualia are only about the geometric aspects,
like shape and size, of the objects of the external world.
One could debate about whether cognition can be identiﬁed as imagination but this is the working
hypothesis made. The tranformations of thoughts into actions or sensory experiences and of sensory
inputs into thoughts correspond to p-adic–real phase transitions for mindlike space-time sheets so that
one can speak about matter-mind interaction in a well-deﬁned sense. Cognition is predicted to be
present already at elementary particle length scales and this assumption is crucial for understanding
the success of the p-adic length scale hypothesis works and p-adic mass calculations.
One can identify p-adic space-time sheets as correlates of memes [J37] and relate them to the
morphic ﬁelds of Sheldrake. The p-adic vision about cognition is discussed in [K52] .
Whole-body consciousness and ordinary consciousness
TGD predicts two basic modes of consciousness.
1. Reducible self is the state in which sub-selves are ”falling asleep” and ”waking up” all the time,
corresponds naturally to the ordinary state of consciousness. Sub-selves represent mental images
which pop out and dissappear all the time.
2. In case of irreducible self quantum jumps do not lead to a generation of sub-selves.
Thus
the sub-systems of irreducible self have only bound state entanglement and self measurement
cascade stops at irreducible self. This state is presumably accompanied by the experience of
”oneness” and could therefore be called a state of ”whole-body consciousness”. The absence
of the sub-selves means the absence of mental images so that the identiﬁcation as a state of
pure self awareness without any contents is natural. Less ideal situation is that sub-selves are
generated but are very short lived and represent short ﬂashes against background awareness.
”Whole-body-consciousness” presumably means abnormally low metabolism since dissipation
inside sub-selves is not present.

72
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
Active and passive aspects of conscious experience
Conscious experience involves two fundamental contributions.
1. The ”non-classical” contribution from the quantum measurement reducing quantum entangle-
ment associated with the fermionic degrees of freedom and with the quantum ﬂuctuating con-
ﬁguration space degrees of freedom (as opposed to zero modes).
2. The ”classical” contribution determined by the localization in zero modes and by the selection
between diﬀerent degenerate absolute minimum space-time surfaces having diﬀerent decompo-
sitions into p-adic regions.
The natural guess is that the experienced free will corresponds to the non-determinism of the
quantum jump somehow. The standard objection is that the non-determinism of the quantum mea-
surement gives rise to randomness rather than volition.
Quantum numbers relate to microscopic
aspects of the quantum jump and the average quantum numbers measured in quantum jumps prob-
ably sum up to zero in the presence of energy feed and external perturbations. Indeed, if temporal
binding for the experiences of self involves averaging, this component of experience need not give rise
to an experience of volition since it is expected to average out for large number of quantum jumps
(1038 per second by the argument for the arrow of psychological time). Therefore the time averaging
involved with the temporal binding smooths out this non-determinism.
Here the special features of TGD however come in rescue.
1. The ﬁrst candidate for the quantum correlate of volition is the localization in zero modes.
This localization corresponds to the spontaneous symmetry breaking of quantum ﬁeld theories
which selects one classical conﬁguration among many degenerate ones. Spontaneous symmetry
breaking has been suggested to be a basic aspect of the quantum jump also by Joel Henkel [J73]
. Asymptotic localization in zero modes seems to be however determined statistically by the
self-organization process taking the system to the bottom of some valley of the spin glass energy
landscape. Hence volition need not be in question.
2. The second candidate for volition is classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action (which gives rise
to the geometric model of thought as ”association sequence”). The selection between the diﬀerent
degenerate alternative classical time evolutions, that is diﬀerent degenerate absolute minima
X4(Y 3) going through a given 3-surface Y 3, is an excellent candidate for the volitional act. The
reason is that absolute minima diﬀer macroscopically so that the choice between degenerate
minima dramatically aﬀects the entire geometric future. Note also that the selection between
branches of a multifurcation of macroscopic space-time is in question, the choice can be done
only when mindlike space-time sheet is located in a narrow time interval around multifurcation
and is hence irreversible. The identiﬁcation of the classical non-determinism as a geometric
correlate of the volitional non-determinism is in nice accordance with the ”ontogeny recapitulates
phylogeny” principle stating that the geometric time evolution at the level of the space-time
surface reﬂects the time evolution by quantum jumps at the level of the conﬁguration space.
One can however argue that this kind of volition is still passive in that it is only a selection
between given alternatives rather than a transformation of an intention to action. The second
objection is that there are actually inﬁnite number of options between which to select in the
state function reduction: why do we not experience these alternatives consciously?
3. The third candidate for volition is a quantum jump in which p-adic-to-real transformation for a
p-adic space-time sheet representing cognitively intention occurs so that it becomes an action.
This identiﬁcation of the volitional act seems to be the most realistic one and indeed allows to
understand how the notion of psychological time emerges. Since complete localization occurs
in p-adic degrees of freedom in the state function reduction stage, there is no selection between
inﬁnite number of alternatives but only a selection of the p-adic space-time sheet which is
transformed to a real one and induces the self-organization process possibly leading to the
desired goal.
An interesting possibility is that the zero modes characterizing the macroscopic features of the
macroscopically equivalent space-time surfaces present in the ﬁnal quantum state of quantum jump

2.5. Various types of conscious experiences
73
determine the contents of at least sensory experiences. This would be in accord with the idea that pure
sensory experiences represent quantities which indeed ’are in the world’, the world being identiﬁed
as the macroscopic space-time associated with the ﬁnal quantum history of the quantum jump. One
could however argue that it is only the increments of zero modes in quantum jump, which are perceived
directly consciously: this claim is consistent with the fact that insects are able to see only the motion
and that also human visual consciousness is crucially dependent on saccadic motion. Localization
in the zero modes involves the ﬁxing of the parameters characterizing the shape and size of the 3-
surface X3 as well as the K¨ahler ﬁeld of X4(X3). K¨ahler ﬁeld can reduce to a purely electromagnetic
or Z0 type classical gauge ﬁeld and is in general also accompanied by a classical color ﬁeld. The
spatio-temporal patterns of the induced K¨ahler ﬁeld should correlate strongly with the contents of the
conscious experience.
2.5.2
Cognition and p-adic physics
p-Adic non-determinism follows from the fact that functions with vanishing derivatives are piecewise
constant functions in the p-adic context. More precisely, p-adic pseudo constants depend on the pinary
cutoﬀof their arguments and replace integration constants in p-adic diﬀerential equations. In case
of ﬁeld equations this means roughly that the initial data are replaced with initial data given for a
discrete set of time values chosen in such a manner that a unique solution of ﬁeld equations results.
Solution can be ﬁxed also in a discrete subset of rational points of the imbedding space. Presumably
the uniqueness requirement implies some unique pinary cutoﬀ.
Thus the space-time surfaces representing solutions of p-adic ﬁeld equations are analogous to space-
time surfaces consisting of pieces of solutions of the real ﬁeld equations. Thus p-adic reality is much
like the dream reality consisting of rational fragments glued together in illogical manner or pieces of
child’s drawing of body containing body parts in more or less chaotic order.
The obvious interpretation for the solutions of the p-adic ﬁeld equations is as a geometric correlate
of imagination. Plans, intentions, expectations, dreams, and cognition in general are expected to
have p-adic cognitive space-time sheets as their geometric correlates. A deep principle seems to be
involved: incompleteness is characteristic feature of p-adic physics but the ﬂexibility made possible
by this incompleteness is absolutely essential for imagination and cognitive consciousness in general.
If one accepts the idea that real and p-adic space-time regions are correlates for matter and
cognitive mind, one encounters the question how matter and mind interact. A good candidate for this
interaction is the phase transition leading to a transformation of the real space-time regions to p-adic
ones and vice versa. These transformations can take place in quantum jumps. p-Adic-to-real phase
transition would have interpretation as a transformation of thought into a sensory experience (dream
or hallucination) or to an action. The reverse phase transition might relate to the transformation of
the sensory experience to cognition. Sensory experiences could be also transformed to cognition by
initial values realized as common rational points of a real space-time sheet representing sensory input
and a p-adic space-time sheet representing the cognitive output. In this case the cognitive mental
image is unique only in case that p-adic pseudo constants are ordinary constants.
The identiﬁcation of p-adic physics as physics of cognition satisﬁes quite a number of consistency
constraints.
1. Consistency constraints force to assume that p-adic regions of 3-surface do not contribute to the
line element of the conﬁguration space. This means that p-adic degrees of freedom are zero modes
and thus completely classical in the sense that a localization occurs in p-adic conﬁguration space
degrees of freedom in each quantum jump. Thus the word of cognition is completely classical.
2. Classicality of cognition implies that there are no non-geometric cognitive qualia determined
by the increments of quantum numbers in quantum jumps but only geometric cognitive qualia
determined by the increments of zero modes. Thoughts are indeed non-colored. Same applies to
emotions if emotions correspond to rates of the entropies associated with various non-geometric
sensory qualia. Since it is not possible to talk about the sign of the p-adic entropy gradient
(p-adic numbers are not well-ordered), one cannot classify possible geometric p-adic emotions
to positive and negative. p-Adic Boolean mind is however possible and should represent what
we call rational mind.

74
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
Various identiﬁcations for the quantum correlate of volition were already discussed and it was
found that the most realistic option is the identiﬁcation of volition as associated with a quantum
jump in which a p-adic space-time sheet representing an intention is transformed to a real region
representing action. This identiﬁcation leads also to the assignment of the psychological time with
the phase transition front at which intentions transform to action proceeding to the direction of the
geometric future. The diﬀerence between intentions and memories would be that intentions are p-adic
whereas memories are real.
2.5.3
Reﬂective- and proto-levels of consciousness
The decomposition into proto consciousness and reﬂective consciousness (consciousness about being
conscious) is one of the fundamental features of conscious experience.
Logical thinking is also a
fundamental component of conscious mind and probably also the mind unconscious-to-us, in fact
so fundamental one that is has inspired the computationalistic approach to consciousness. One can
consider two alternative identiﬁcations for the reﬂective level of consciousness.
Boolean mind as reﬂective mind?
The state basis of the Fock space generated by N fermionic creation operators is isomorphic with the
Boolean algebra consisting of 2N possible statements about N basic statements. This follows from
the simple observation that by Pauli exclusion principle the fermion number associated with a given
fermion state can have only two values: 0 (false) or 1 (true). This observation leads to the idea that
many fermion states give representation for what might be called reﬂective consciousness in the sense
that the information contents for experiences about conscious experiences could correspond to the
quantum jumps in the fermionic sector.
A more convincing interpretation is that Boolean mind is onlhy a special case of reﬂective mind. In
p-adic case only quaternion conformal degrees of freedom are possible for conﬁguration space spinors
(see appendix) and since pure cognition involves no emotions and no values it must correspond to logic
(true/false). In real case the spin associated with the conﬁguration space metric correlates with the
sensory experience and naturally corresponds to the logic of aesthetics (beautiful/ugly) whereas real
quaternion conformal degrees of freedom having no correlation with the sensory experience correspond
naturally to the logic of ethics (right/wrong), or more generally the true/false logic of belief system
having strong right/wrong emotional coloring. Thus the Goodness-Truth-Beauty trinity would thus
have a reduction to the Boolean algebra deﬁned by the Fock basis for the conﬁguration space spinors.
TGD based model of abstraction process involves a hierarchy of statements about statements
about.... starting from 2 basic statements such that the statement represented by empty set in the
set theoretic realization of Boolean algebra is thrown away at each step. The model predict besides
the genetic code also a memetic code consisting of 127-bit code words such that 126-bit statements
form a maximal number of mutually consistent statements. In case of genetic code 7-bit code words
represent all possible statements and 64-bit codewords represent mutually consistent statements.
In real context, 6-bit code words for the genetic code and 126 bit code words for the memetic
code code form a maximal number of mutually consistent ’this is right thing to do’ beliefs. 7-bit resp.
127-bit code words can be interpreted as coding these statements and their negations: all bits must
be realized in p-adic case since formal logic requires also the negations of the basic statements. Lying
is a cognitive skill. Genetic code would represent in case of the molecular society the moral and social
rules whereas memetic code would represent these rules in case of the ordinary society. DNA would
provide a symbolic representation for the 64 fundamental truths, kind of a legal code.
Symbolic and cognitive representations as means of becoming conscious about being
conscious about?
An alternative identiﬁcation of the reﬂective mind is in terms of language and cognitive representations
made possible by the nondeterminism of K¨ahler action and inherent nondeterminism of p-adic diﬀer-
ential equations. These nondeterminisms allow to represent contents of consciousness of self (quantum
jump sequence) cognitively and symbolically and to become conscious these representations: this is
nothing but becoming conscious about being conscious about...

2.5. Various types of conscious experiences
75
The (inconvincing) Boolean identiﬁcation of reﬂective mind predicts a single directly experienced
reﬂective level.
In the second case given quantum jump allows the emergence of only single new
reﬂective level. Indeed, it is easy to become conscious about seeing red but one cannot have direct
experience of being conscious about being conscious about seeing red. It is also easy to build theorems
about theorems (or imagine what happens under given circumstances) but deriving theorems about
theorems about theorems looks impossible without paper and pencil.
Zero energy ontology allows to realize the vision about the reﬂective hierarchy of consciousness in a
concrete manner. The basic building blocks would be negentropically entangled systems representing
rules with state pairs deﬁning the entangled state interpreted as instances of the rule.
One can
construct rules about rules as states formed from this kind of states. The many-sheeted space-time
would provide geometric correlates for these rules about rules. The hierarchy of inﬁnite primes would
also relate to this abstraction hierarchy.
2.5.4
General model for sensory experiences
The concept of self provides considerable insight to the model of sensory experiencing.
1. If temporal binding involves averaging over the experiences occurred after the wake-up, experi-
ences are reliable.
2. Also the averaging over the experiences of separate sensory subsub-selves implied by the sum-
mation hypothesis could be involved.
3. Sensory experiences can involve more than the direct experiencing: also a comparison with
the earlier sensory data could quite well be involved and is made possible by subjective and
geometric memories. Sensory experiences certainly involve computational aspects.
In the following the general model of sensory experiencing is discussed only brieﬂy [K70] .
Macroscopic quantum phases are needed
Self must be able to remain unentangled in subsequence quantum jumps. The presence of the macro-
scopic quantum condensate means usually energy gap between ground state and excited states. This
can make the generation of real entanglement very slow process and self can exist.
The fact that macroscopic quantum phases have coupling to the classical gauge ﬁelds, suggests
that the order parameters of the macroscopic quantum phases are compeletely determined by the
localization in the zero modes. Thus the contents of the sensory experience should correlate with
these order parameters. This motivated the original attempt to identify macroscopic quantum phases
as quantum correlates of the sensory qualia.
A more reﬁned approach identiﬁes quantum phase
transitions of the macroscopic quantum phases as correlates of sensory qualia so that the increments
of quantum numbers in the phase transition label various qualia. This identiﬁcation is completely
general and almost brain independent (cell length scale turns however be crucially important p-adic
length scale).
Many-sheeted space-time concept makes possible large number of macroscopic quantum phases not
possible in standard physics context. In particular, the so called massless extremals (MEs) representing
’topological light rays’ provide a model for how linear structures such as DNA and microtubules could
act as quantum antennae emitting and absorbing coherent photon distribution ﬁxed completely by
localization in zero modes. Coherent photons could realize the concept of global workspace [J28] and
could make possible ”mass media” at neural level. Also the concept of ”neural window” abstracting
the notion of hologramic brain suggests itself [K14, K28] . MEs form a fractal hierarchy and are carriers
of super-symplectic representations for which states are genuine functionals in the space of 3-surfaces
(’world of worlds’) and thus correspond to higher abstraction level than ordinary quantum states.
Super-symplectic states have also gigantic almost degenaries. MEs act also as quantum holograms.
For these reasons MEs are ideal candidates for a hierarchy of life forms [K28] . In particular,
the assignment of ’our’ sensory qualia with super-symplectic quantum transitions looks reasonable
whereas magnetic quantum phase transitions might well correspond to more primitive chemical qualia
not directly conscious to us.

76
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
The functions of nerve pulses
The identiﬁcation of the sensory qualia in terms of the quantum phase transitions associated with
macroscopic quantum phases is in conﬂict with the general belief that neuronal activity determines
completely the contents of the sensory experiences. In TGD framework one can understand the role of
the nerve pulse activity diﬀerently. Brain is quantum spin glass and the evolution of sub-selves/mental
images is a dissipative self-organization process leading to some asymptotic self-organization patterns
which correspond to the valleys of the spin glass energy landscape.
The contents of the sensory
experiences are determined by the zero modes which in turn determine the ground state patterns of
the order parameters of various macroscopic quantum phases.
The crucial element of the self-organization is external energy feed making possible interesting
self-organization patterns. One role of the nerve pulses is to provide this metabolic energy feed. This
suggests that the axons are seats of the self-organization patterns coding at least part of the neuronal
experience. Brain seems to systematically maximize the length of the axons feeding sensory data
(for instance, right ear feed its sensory input to the left hemisphere). Brain anatomy seems also to
favour long pyramidal axons. This phenomenon, which seems to be in conﬂict with the principles of
good metabolic economy, is consistent with the maximization of the expressive power of the sensory
pathways. Microtubule conformations are excellent candidates for realizers of declarative memory
and this would also explain why the lengths of sensory axons tend to be maximized. Myelin sheets
guarantee that external perturbations do not aﬀect the self-organization patterns. It is also possible
that myelin sheets form together with the axon Josephson junctions for various super conductors
predicted by TGD and are thus essential for the generation of neuronal sensory experiences.
Nerve pulses aﬀect also the postsynaptic cell: typically excitation or inhibition is in question.
The interpretation is that the incoming nerve pulses push and pull the postsynaptic cell in diﬀerent
directions and in this manner cause frustrations typical for spin glass like systems. The assumption
that neural transmitters give rise to some kind of chemical senses at neuronal level as well as neuronal
emotions is in accordance with this. Also frequency coding is consistent with the identiﬁcation of the
nerve pulse activity as a control function.
Of course, spatio-temporal patterns of nerve pulses might also code information about sensory
experience. There is indeed evidence that various odours are coded into spatio-temporal nerve pulse
patterns [J88] . For instance, for the neurons of the associative regions of cortex receiving inputs
from several sensory modalities this kind of discrimination is obviously highly desirable. One can even
consider the possibility that nerve pulse patterns, in some parts of brain at least (in output axons of
association regions), provide a precise naming for axonal experiences.
The notion of memetic code encourages to consider this idea quite seriously and the physical
model of the memetic code [K31] . realizes a precise coding of the nerve pulse patters to 126 bit
temporal sequences represented in terms of time-varying Z0 magnetization direction of cognitive anti-
neutrinos. Bits could correspond to Boolean truth values or bits in a binary expansion of a integer
providing measure for the intensity of the net presynaptic sensory experience represented by the
cognitive neutrino pairs of the postsynaptic axon: this would be essentially a mapping of experience
to its symbol. This naming would serve also as the basis of our language and duration of a phoneme
could correspond to the predicted duration of codeword of order .1 seconds. A degenerate form of
memetic code would be based on nerve pulses an realize frequency coding whereas full memetic code
would be based on neuronal membrane oscillations.
The model for sensory qualia and sensory representations [K28, K37] assumes that nerve pulse
patterns generate EEG MEs (massless extremals) entangling brain with the sensory magnetic canvas.
The question where the mental images responsible for the sensory qualia are located, still lacks a
convincing answer.
Primary qualia could even correspond to mental images associated with the
sensory receptors and sensory pathways could serve as cortex-receptor entanglers. Brain would give
names for sensory inputs and percepts rather than creating the primary qualia. This would require
feedback from brain to the sensory organs.
Frequency coding is not the only manner to code information to nerve pulse patterns and delicate
temporal coding mechanisms exist.
For instance, frequencies can be coded to peaks of the spike
interval distribution by stochastic resonance [D6] . Also the coding of spike interval distribution to
EEG frequencies is possible (a kick to a harmonic oscillator at the correct half period leads to a
resonant ampliﬁcation [K65] ).

2.5. Various types of conscious experiences
77
How qualia are associated with neural pathways?
Since TGD predicts entire hierarchy of selves, it is important to specify whose sensory experience one
is talking about. In TGD framework nerve pulse patterns as such need not give rise to our sensory
exerience and it is quite possible that also primary sensory organs have sensory experiences.
Frustratinly, the question about the seat of quale mental images remains unanswered.
1. The assumption that primary qualia are somehow associated with or determined by the sensory
receptors would resolve a diﬃcult question about how sensory pathways, which do not seem to
have any obvious diﬀerences at the level of brain, give rise to qualia. The entanglement of the
sensory receptors with brain in turn entangled with the magnetic body would give rise to the
sensory representations. Our sensory experience would not be localizable to what happens in
the brain region: indeed, MEs in EEG frequency region have size of order Earth size.
Various objections (hallucinations, experiences generated by the stimulation of the sensory path-
ways, phantom leg phenomenon, dreams) against this view can be circumvented if there is a
feedback between brain and sensory organs (as there indeed is), and if sensory experiences can
also correspond to geometric memories (say in case of phantom leg experience). If sensory recep-
tors are the experiencers of the primary sensory qualia, then conscious experience can precede
the neural activity in the cortex, as observed by Libet in his classical experiements concerning
the timing of the sensory experiencing [J56] .
2. A more general view is that the neuronal receptors (also ”ﬁeld receptors” responsible for neuronal
vision and hearing can be present) along the sensory pathway are specialized to experience only
special sensory qualia characterizing the sensory pathway.
How the primary and possible also secondary sensory receptors or sensory pathways could then
give rise to particular qualia? Quite generally qualia correspond to average increments of quantum
numbers for the quantum jump sequence deﬁning sub-self.
In the case of color qualia one has a
partial answer. For MEs super-symplectic quantum transitions are characterized by conﬁguration
space Hamiltonians carrying spin and color (SU(3)) quantum numbers.
For conﬁguration space
photons state functional in conﬁguration space degrees of freedom is nontrivial and characterized
by conﬁguration space Hamiltonian with quantum numbers characterizing a particular quale. This
suggests that somehow neural pathway or sensory receptor should be able to generate ’conﬁguration
space photons’ (MEs) BE condensing on larger MEs and inducing visual color qualia at least. This
would mean that conﬁguration space photons would in a well-deﬁned sense carry qualia: the photons
generated by sensory receptors and brain could be colored after all!
The educated guess is that the EEG transition frequencies coded the spike interval distributions
associated with the sensory pathway characterize the sensory pathway partially. EEG frequencies in
turn determine partially the quantum phase transitions which can be stimulated by that particular
sensory pathway. The miminal option is that these transitions relate only with what parts of magnetic
body the sensory pathway is entangled with. This would make possible very high functional ﬂexibility
in accordance with the observed plasticity of brain.
Only changes are perceived
One of the basic laws about sensory experiencing is that only changes and novelties are perceived.
For instance, totally monochromatic illumination is experienced as darkness. The zero modes charac-
terizing the macroscopic space-time associated with the ﬁnal quantum history of the quantum jump
should determine the contents of the sensory experience. Part of the zero modes corresponds to the
induced K¨ahler of CP2 which is nonlinear Maxwell ﬁeld closely related to the classical electromag-
netic and Z0 ﬁelds. There are also zero modes representing the size and shape of 3-surface: these
might be related to the discriminative sense of touch. A possible generalization of the law is that
sensory stimulus generates K¨ahler electric ﬁeld proportional to the gradient of the stimulus. This
creates however a problem. K¨ahler electric ﬂux must be conserved in the approximation that vacuum
Maxwell’s equations are satisﬁed (they are not exactly satisﬁed since vacuum can carry currents of
K¨ahler charge). Suppose that stimulus has a strong gradient: where does the K¨ahler electric ﬂux go
in this kind of situation?

78
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
The solution of the problem might be very simple: mindlike space-time sheet is generated and the
ﬂux goes to the mindlike space-time sheet through wormhole contacts. Since sensory stimulus varies
rapidly at the boundaries of the objects of the external world, this means that the objects of the
perceptive ﬁeld are automatically represented by mindlike space-time sheets and give rise to selves,
mental images already at the level of the sensory organ or the sensory pathway leading to thalamus.
The extreme generality of the mechanism suggests that it could be at work also at the level of brain.
Understanding of the computational aspects of sensory experience (say stereovision) is not possible
unless one assumes that mindlike space-time sheets in sensory pathway combine with the primary
sensory organs to form coherent quantum systems.
”Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny” principle
requires that these space-time sheets are connected by join along boundaries bonds most naturally
associated with axons leading from sensory organ to brain.
Are the ultimate sensory representations realized outside brain?
One of the dramatic almost predictions of TGD inspired theory of consciousness is that our physical
body is accompanied by a hierarchy of ﬁeld bodies, in particular magnetic body. A given ﬁeld body
provides abstract representations about quantum aspects of the physical body, kind of a manual.
This prediction plus some general arguments lead to the view that sensory representations are most
naturally realized outside the physical body at the personal magnetic body (ﬁrst person aspect of
consciousness) and at the magnetic body of Earth (third person aspect of consciousness).
This vision leads to the interpretation of EEG as being involved with MEs projecting sensory data
to the magnetic body. EEG ME would generate quantum entanglement between two mental images:
a feature inside brain and a ’simple feeling of existence’ mental image at the magnetic body and
representing a point of the external world. Thus the main function of brain would be the construction
of features and sensory representations would be completely separated from their construction. Note
that also in the case of computers the representation of the data is separated from the generation of
the data.
2.5.5
Emotions
TGD suggests several visions about emotions and it is not yet completely clear whether these views
are really mutually consistent.
Emotions and comparisons
The basic element of mentality is the comparison between the expectations of future and what actually
occurred. In TGD framework this tension between potential and actual can be understood. Subjective
and geometric memories make it possible to compare the expectations with what really occurred
during the time interval since subjective memory is kind of heap of predictions of future arranged
with respect to the value of the psychological time. Many higher emotions such as sorrow, depression,
frustration, desire, happiness, feeling of relief, pain, fear, anger, envy, hatred, etc... clearly involve
comparison of expectations and reality. This could perhaps mean that these emotions are created by
the comparison of the predicted or desired geometric time history and subjective time history (what
really happened).
This would mean that at least higher emotions diﬀer from the sensory qualia,
which seem to be determined solely by the localization into zero modes representing the non-quantum
ﬂuctuating aspects of space-time geometry.
One might however argue that very primitive emotions such as rage without any object and
involving only the activity of the limbic brain could be quale like and that hormones are the quantum
correlates of these emotions. These emotions involve however a change of behaviour (e-motion!) so
that one could argue that also now there is a simple comparison involved. Perhaps changes in the
hormone concentrations could be regarded as consequences of the change of the emotional state. Or
vice versa, if hormones are messangers telling to very simple selves of limbic brain whether the real
course of events was the desired one or not, then hormones indeed eﬀectively control the emotional
state and can be regarded as quantum correlates of emotions.
It is diﬃcult to assign any comparison to an emotion like deep love since it involves a complete
acceptance of the object of love and is free of desires. Perhaps the claim of mystics that deep experience
of love means that subject and object of love cease to exist as separate objects, makes sense. Lovers

2.5. Various types of conscious experiences
79
quantum entangle and die as separate selves (for some fraction of time only, of course!) and the
higher self consisting of lovers experiences whole-body consciousness. Perhaps more mundane love
means that my sub-selves representing me and the loved one entangle to form a sub-self experiencing
whole-body consciousness. Perhaps also feelings like empathy belong to this class of emotions.
Emotions and entropy
The concrete model of qualia to be developed in [K28] provides an alternative general vision about
emotions which allows to understand the diﬀerence between comparison type emotions and other
emotions as well as the role of emotions in control.
1. The statistical physics approach to qualia leads to the hypothesis that emotions correspond to
rates for the generation of various type of entropies for the sub-selves of self. The sign of the
rate tells whether emotion is positive or negative. Negative emotions would thus be conscious
control variables warning self when some sub-system is generating entropy. The holistic nature
of the emotions can be understood easily in this picture and also the fact that they are not
directly related to sensory input. One could perhaps also understand higher level emotions like
sorrow as reﬂecting the growing disorder of the virtual world of brain resulting from the primary
cause of sorrow.
2. It is known that peptides correlate strongly with emotions and moods [J102] and they are
even called molecules of emotions. Peptides are also regarded as information molecules. This
connection between information and emotions ﬁts nicely with the fact that peptides and other
important biomolecules certainly induce strong entropy gradients with respect to subjective
time.
3. Sensory qualia can be divided to geometric and non-geometric ones. One can classify also emo-
tions in this manner. Emotions corresponding to the localization in zero modes would perhaps
correspond to ’higher level emotions’ about external world (say, aesthetic qualia) whereas the
non-geometric emotions associated with the state preparation would correspond to ’self-centered’
emotions about the state of body (pain, physical pleasure,...).
4. Also pure emotions which seem to involve no obvious comparison (love, joy, excitement,..) are
possible. For instance, the emotions produced by music might represent this kind of emotions.
The view about emotions as entropy gradients allows to understand also emotions of this kind.
In state of deep love, self enters into very low-entropy state and mental images (not necessarily
even present in ’enlightened states’) become very pure.
5. An interesting question is whether the entropy growth of our sensory sub-selves is only sensory
representation for the entropy growth occurring at the level of atomic space-time sheets or
corresponds directly to it. The enormous diﬀerence of the temperatures associated with the
atomic space-time sheets (ordinary matter) and superconducting magnetic ﬂux tube structures
would suggest that the growth rates for these entropies are of totally diﬀerent order of magnitude
and our emotions serve have the role of conscious control variables telling whether things are
going well at the atomic space-time sheets.
Consider now the comparison type emotions and the relation of emotions to control in more detail.
1. Many emotions are comparison type emotions. These emotions tend to be negative (say envy).
The ﬁrst option is that comparison type emotions result from the comparison of geometric and
subjective memories occurring automatically in any quantum jump and thus to some degree
with any quale. Unfortunately, it is very diﬃcult to imagine how to concretely test this kind of
hypothesis and it is also diﬃcult to see how the connection with entropy gradient could emerge.
2. One must also seriously consider the possibility that emotions result from the comparison of
remembered/anticipated experience and real experience rather than the fundamental compar-
ison involved with anticipation and memory: kind of quasi-computerized version of geometric
memory would be in question. The result of comparison would be coded to the sign of the
growth rate of some entropy variable.
The comparison could perhaps be realized in such a

80
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
manner that subsequent quantum jumps for comparing sub-system could represent either the
anticipated or real quale. If this were the case, the diﬀerence between anticipated and real would
automatically induce growth of entropy and negative emotion would result. This would be the
basic mechanism of dissappointment. In this picture comparison type emotions could be seen
as a system of rewards and punishments used to control the self (the controller could be higher
level self (conscience) or higher levels selves which also want to survive (the emotions gener-
ated by hunger, ﬁrst, and physical pain). Punish/reward mechanisms could basically involve
negentropy/entropy feed to some sub-self.
3. One could also regard emotion as induced by generalized sensory qualia giving information about
CNS itself rather than external world or the boundary between external world and body. The
regulation involved with the homeostasis involves comparison in an essential manner so that
one could perhaps regard emotions as analogous to control variables representing consciously
the result of comparison of expected and desired forcing the organism to behave in a manner to
reduce this diﬀerence and end up to a rest and digest state. This aspect is consistent with the
statistical interpretation since the entropy gradients associated with the organism are stronger
than those associated with the surrounding world. Also ampliﬁcation mechanisms exaggerating
the entropy gradients might have developed. For instance, our reactions to some odours or tastes
could involve this kind of ampliﬁcation.
4. A hypothesis consistent with these views is that emotional component is involved with all sensory
experiences and that we are used to call generalized sensory experiences emotions when they
are about body.
The emotionality of qualia indeed increases in the sequence of perceptive
ﬁelds external world – CNS-world boundary – body. The degree of emotionality of experience
should be characterized by the deviation of real from expected or desired and this suggests that
the emotional component is much stronger for sensory experiences about CNS itself, since the
system in question is much less predictable than the external world consisting of dead objects.
Interpretation of emotion as measure for entropy gradient explains also this hierarchy.
5. Depression could be seen as a lost ability to experience emotions, be they positive or negative.
Depression indeed involves emotional ﬂatness. This state results when mental images become
maximally entropic (emotional counterpart of heat death). That depression can follow deep
sorrow is natural since negative emotions tend to increase the entropy of the mental images.
It is known that depression involves over-activity of the amygdala and under-activity of some
forebrain regions and an abnormally small population of glial cells known to be closely involved
with metabolism and ’cleansing activities’ at brain level. This supports the view that glial cells
might be warriors in the war against second law at the level of atomic space-time sheets and the
loss of this war is sensorily mapped to the level of mental images and leads to depression. One
function of serotonin, dopamin and various other neuropharmaca tending to produce pleasant
experiences could be a reduction of entropy either at atomic space-time sheets or, less probably,
directly at the level of our sensory sub-selves.
2.5.6
Directed attention
The possibility to interpret self as a statistical ensemble suggests that the entropy of the mental image
measures its fuzziness.
Thus both attentiveness, alertness and level of arousal should relate very
closely to the entropy of the mental images. Attention to a mental image could mean ﬁght against
second law to keep the mental image in a low entropy state and this requires metabolism (the icons on
the computer screen provide a good example of this). Also alertness means mental images with low
entropy content. 7 ± 2 rule of cognitive science suggests that the maximum number of our cognitive
sub-selves which can be awake simultaneously, is rather limited. The rule might be based on the
metabolic limitations: sub-selves can have low entropy content only in the presence of an external
negentropy feed and metabolism must provide the needed negentropy feed. Note however that the
needed metabolic energy might be extremely low.
Directed attention is one of the basic processes of consciousness occurring continually. Directed
attention seems to involve free choice but focusing of attention could also occur spontaneously. One
can imagine several models for the focusing of attention.

2.5. Various types of conscious experiences
81
1. One possibility is that subsub-self inside sub-self representing mental image (say ’monitor screen’
as average over subsub-selves representing the visual objects) somehow pops up one level higher
in the self hierarchy so that it becomes mental image. Geometrically this could correspond to
the re-gluing of the corresponding space-time sheet to the space-time sheet of self instead of that
of sub-self. In this case attended object would not pre-exist.
2. A further aspect of the focused of attention is as a wake-up of sub-self and keeping it in wake-up
state and hence in short term memory. This could occur at the expense of the other sub-selves,
which would be in wake-up state for only short times. A possible mechanism of selection is a
phase transition changing the topology of chosen region (say from p-adic to real or from p1-adic
to p2-adic) so that a new sub-self pops up from the background.
3. Self directs automatically its attention only to sub-systems immediately below it in the hierarchy.
It seems however possible to direct attention to lower levels of the self hierarchy. For instance, I
can direct my attention to the entire sentence, which I am writing here or to some word of this
sentence or to individual letters of this word. The phenomenon of bio-feedback demonstrates
that it is possible to learn to direct the attention to even single neuron. This suggests that selves
are able to modify the hierarchy of selves by raising some sub...sub-self to the role of sub-self
temporarily and thus experience the former sub...sub-self as a direct mental image. Formation
of the join along boundaries bonds between mindlike space-time sheets at various levels of the
self hierarchy provides a general geometric mechanism making possible temporary changes of the
structure of the self hierarchy. Also the learning taking place during sleep [J103] migh involve
interaction between diﬀerent levels of the self-hierarchy.
Anyone can do a simple but thought provoking experiment suggesting the presence of the macro-
scopic quantum entanglement at the level of brain and a change of the level of sub-self in the self
hierarchy. Look at a mirror, direct your attention at your left eye, and redirect the gaze to the right
eye. What you ﬁnd that it is impossible to perceive the change in the direction of the eye gaze.
1. Consider ﬁrst what probably happens when we perceive a moving object. A negentropic binding
of the mental images of the visual ﬁeld to single mental image implies that both the parts and
the whole can be experienced so that the motion is perceived. If the direction of the gaze is
stationary, the object moves relative to the background, and if the direction of the gaze follows
the object the background moves with respect to the direction of gaze. In both cases the motion
can be perceived.
2. If the eye follows its own rotating mirror image, neither of these options is realized if the
environment to which the attention is directed is restricted to be the eye itself. The direction
of the gaze should remain the same in order to perceive the change of the direction of the gaze
but this is impossible.
3. The perceptive ﬁeld however contains also other objects and one could argue that if the attention
is directed also to these simultanenously, it should be possible to perceive the changing direction
of gaze as they move relative to the changing direction of gaze. Does the very act of directing
attention to the mirror image of eye separate it from the negentropic entanglement with the
other mental images so that the conscious comparison with them is not possible anymore? Or is
the visual mental image representing eye at a diﬀerent level of hierarchy as mental images from
the very beginning and cannot negentropically entangle with the other visual mental images?
Eye cannot perceive itself! Not even in mirror.
One should also understand what it means to direct the attention to an object of perceptive
ﬁeld. Certainly this process is directed and selective. Could the direction of attention to an object
of perceptive ﬁeld separate the corresponding mental image from the negentropic fusion of mental
images as a separate mental image? Could it be that the motion of object can be perceived only if the
attention is ﬁxed only temporarily to the object? There are almost incredible sounding experiments
demonstrating that the attention directed intensely to a ﬁxed object makes it impossible to perceive
what happens in environment.

2.5.7
Altered states of consciousness
The proposed concept of self provides allows rather rich a palette of altered states of consciousness and
one cannot avoid the temptation to a concrete modelling of various altered states of consciousness. It
seems that negentropic entanglement provides a general explanation for the reported characteristic of
these experiences.
Whole-body consciousness and ordinary consciousness
Krishnamurti has described in his books states of consciousness having natural identiﬁcation as states
of ’whole-body consciousness’. For instance, according to Krishamurti, one can achieve this state only
if one is able to stop thinking entirely. If thoughts correspond to cascades of selves decomposing into
sub-selves during state function reduction proess, then this is just what is required. The character-
istic of this state of consciousness as reported by meditators are the experience of one-ness and the
absence of all separations. The absence of separation would conform with negentropic entanglement.
One-oneness could correspond to irreducible selfness without subselves or to the negentropic fusion
of mental images to single mental image.
Also ’timelessness’ characterizes these experiences: the
explanation is that internal clock is provided by some sub-self waking up periodically and since there
are no sub-selves there can be no time. Note also that negentropic time like entanglement fuses the
subselves assignable to the future and past boundaries of CD to single self.
I have personally experienced states of whole-body consciousness and also states in which whole-
body consciousness is limited to some part of body. These states begin with a sudden fall of silence: all
the usual ’noise’ from the body disappears suddenly although ordinary physical sounds are still heard.
This could be interpreted as disappearance of sub-selves from body or as generation of negentropic
entanglement stable under quantum jumps. There is experience like thrill in spine going through the
entire body. Interesting experience of this kind occurred when my cat was sleeping over my breast: I
woke up and realized that my breast was in the state of whole-body consciousness. Could this mean
that sleeping cat was also in this state and that my breast had entangled with the quantum state of
cat? Could this in turn mean that during sleep we indeed are in a state of whole-body consciousness or
even that our entire body is entangled with some large self? Could the absence of neuronal quantum
jumps explain why we do not remember anything about these states?
Are remembered states of
whole-body-consciousness always such that at least some part of brain is awake?
Possession of ego deﬁned as a collection subselves, which repeatedly unentangle themselves from
the external world means dissipation, aging and eventual physical death (note however that self lives
as a conscious memory realized as a sub-self of higher level self providing kind of summary about the
lifetime of self). There would be two manners to getting rid of ego. Get rid of subselves or try to
achieve a state in which they negentropically entangle to single mental image.
The absence of neuronal and cell level dissipation during states of whole-body consciousness pro-
vides a possible test for the phenomenonon. Test persons could be trained meditators and test should
involve the measurement of neural or cellular dissipation occurred during the state of whole-body con-
sciousness. Reduced rate of metabolism could be a measurable signature of whole-body consciousness.
Dissipation should be absent or should be very small during this state at least if it is present for suﬃ-
ciently large fraction of time. The absence of dissipation means that all changes suﬀered by the cells
during whole-body consciousness are reversible and curable. This could explain various miraculous
healings. Whole-body consciousness, if possible to arrange artiﬁcially, could provide medical means
of saving the lifes of victims of accidents (say of victim of heart attack or bleed in brain).
Negentropic entanglement allows the component systems to be free in the sense that there is no
binding energy. Even more, negentropic systems could carry metabolic energy but would not liberate it
or liberate it in much longer time scale than usually (also large ℏcould be involved). As a matter fact,
the high energy phosphate bond assumed in the model of metabolism could correspond to negentropic
entanglement carrying metabolic energy [K26] .
Synchronous neural ﬁring is a possible candidate for whole-body consciousness at the level of brain.
1. The anomalously low value of neuronal oxidative metabolism during synchronous neuronal ﬁring
in cortex could be interpreted in terms of negentropic inter-neuronal entanglement during which
ATP-ADP Karma’s cycle is absent and dissipation is reduced.
2. One could of course argue that metabolic energy is liberated but from other source than ATP.

2.5. Various types of conscious experiences
83
For instance, the formation of bound state entanglement between the group of ﬁring neurons
could liberate the binding energy as metabolic energy. The formation of hydrogen bonds could
be the counterpart for the process at molecular level. This mechanism would however imply
dissipation and there is no strong reason to assign whole-body consciousness to this kind of
state (of course, synchoronous neural ﬁring need not corre.
Whole-body consciousness could explain some spectacular phenomena (not of course taken seri-
ously by skeptics).
1. The claimed ability of yogis to survive for months without eating anything and even without
oxygen could have explanation in terms of whole-body consciousness.
Oxygen consumption
compensates the loss of chemical energy caused by the quantum jumps in biochemical length
scales. These quantum jumps occur only if neuronal and lower level chemical selves exist. Under
usual circumstances the continuous supply of oxygen makes the ageing of cells slow and the lack
of oxygen leads to rapid dissipation and neuronal death. The situation is analogous to Benard
ﬂow: if heat feed is stopped, the beautiful ﬂow pattern rapidly dissipates away. If all cells are
entangled during whole-body consciousness, no dissipation occurs and the lack of the oxygen
supply does not have any irreversible eﬀects and possible eﬀects might be cured automatically.
An alternative explanation for the the mystery of yogis who need not eat is that the generation
of bound state entanglement involves the liberation of the binding energy as a usable energy
possibly compensating for the ordinary metabolic energy.
2. In certain cultures people in trance are able to dance with their bare feet on burning charcoals
without any disastrous eﬀects. The disastrous eﬀects of the interaction of heat from burning
charcoals with cells in soles of foot must be irreversible changes. If these persons are in a state
of whole-body consciousness, then the changes of the invididual cells would reversible.
That-which-is experiences
Irreducible self does not possess any sub-selves. The absence of sub-selves in turn means the absence
of mental images. This kind of situation could correspond to that-which-is experience. The reports
of Buddhist meditators about pure awareness with discrete twinkles of consciousness identiﬁable as
short-lived sub-selves are in accord with this view.
In principle meditation could make possible to silence the hierarchy sub-selves and make it possible
to directly experience quantum jumps occurring at elementary particle level! In zero energy ontology
the temporal size scales assignable to elementary particles are time scales of human consciousness
(electron corresponds to .1 second time scale and u and d quarks to millisecond time scale) plus the
hierarchy of Planck constants as a realization of dark matter hierarchy crucial for living matter and
predicting scaled up variants of these time scales, this idea need not be so crazy at it looks at ﬁrst
sight. In this speculative spirit one could even consider the possibility that the abstract theories of
elementary particle physics result basically as a summation of the experiences of matter-mind sub-
systems entangled with elementary particles! One can even consider the possibility that genetic code is
realized in terms of the sub-CDs assignable to the electronic CDs and could form ﬁrst level realization
of the phonemes of language.
One can also considera weaker notion of one-ness in which self has only single mental image. In
this case sub-selves would fuse to single subself either by bound state entanglement or negentropic
entanglement. The formation of these states is accompanied by the formation of join along bound-
aries bonds -say magnetic ﬂux tubes- between space-time sheets representing binding sub-systems.
State function reduction does not occur in these degrees of freedom anymore, macroscopic quantum
coherence is preserved from quantum jump to quantum jump, and the system behaves as macroscopic
multiverse with new macroscopic degrees of freedom making possible macroscopic quantum compu-
tation. This might be the mechanism for how water, DNA, protein, tubulin,... molecules and even
neurons bind to quantum computing macroscopic multiverses [K23] .
Zen type experiences and negentropic entanglement
Negentropic entanglement is possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. Negentropic states
are not eigenstates of measured observables giving information about the quantum numbers of the

84
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
system or its complement but about the entire system. Conscious experience is an abstraction about
the correlation between states of entangled systems- a rule with instances of the rule being represented
as state pairs. Negentropic entanglement can be also time-like and between systems corresponding
to space-time sheets in diﬀerent number ﬁelds in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
The
simplest example about negentropic entanglement are fuzzy qubits. Zero energy ontology allows to
imagine entire hierarchies of negentropic entanglements between negentropic states and an attractive
interpretation is in terms of a reﬂective hierarchy producing statements about statements.
The reported experience about disappearence of illusions would conform with the interpretation
about experience of understanding assignable to the state. The disappearence of the decomposition to
observer and observed would correspond to the experience of oneness. Zen Buddhists experiences are
often characterized as states of consciousness in which no selection is made between mutually exclusive
alternatives. Hofstadter has described this aspect of Zen in hilarious manner in his book ’G¨odel,
Escher, Bach’. Also this aspect conforms with the basic properties of negentropic entanglement.
The absence of external-world-me separation and absence of desires is also reported to be a char-
acteristic feature of that-which-is and Zen type experiences. Ego separates itself from external world
in quantum jump by state function reduction leading to an uncorrelate product state. Ego disappers
when the self fuses with external world negentropically. Perhaps also desires could be equated with
the tendency to preserve ego.
Extended states of consciousness
Extended states of consciousness seem to be the exact opposite of that-which-experiences. Psi exper-
iments concern subtle connections between subjects removed in space, and occasionally also in time.
These experiments are reviewed in [J79] and the following representation follows this review closely.
The pioneering work related with card and dice-guessing was done by J. B. Rhine in 1930s.
The formation of negentropic entangelement gives a natural general explanation of these experi-
ences. Negentropic sharing and fusion of mental images would be part of the mechanism for extended
states of consciousness.
The notions of geometric memory and electromagnetic self allow also to understand basic features
of these experiences. For instance, the notion of geometric memory allows to understand memories
about previous lives and prenatal experiences in which the the contents of consciousness is time shifted.
The model for sensory representations leads to the conclusion that the topological ﬁeld quanta of
ELF ﬁelds, having frequencies in EEG range and by Uncertainty Principle having size of Earth, are
crucial element of our sensory experience. The formation of join along boundaries contacts between
topological ﬁeld quanta associated with diﬀerent selves could explain a large variety of paranormal
experiences.
1. The experiments of Russel Targ and Harold Puthoﬀ
The experiments of Russel Targ and Harold Puthoﬀ[J127] were carried in the 1970’s some of the
best known experiments on subtle connections among distant subjects in regard to the transference of
thoughts and images. Both sender and receiver were closed in a sealed, opaque, electrically shielded
chamber so that no sensory communication was possible. Sender was subjected to light ﬂashes at
regular intervals. This caused a characteristic pattern in the EEG of the sender. In some cases also
the receiver exhibited these rhytms.
In remote vision experiments sender served as a beacon. Receiver tried to describe verbally or
by scetches what the beacon saw. Independent judges matched on the average 66 per cent of time
with what was actually seen by the beacon. There are also remote viewing experiments from other
laboratories. The distances between sender and receiver vary from miles to thousands of miles and it
seems that distance does not matter.
Distance independence supports the interpretation of both experiments in terms of fusion and
sharing of mental images.
2. The experiments of Stanley Krippner
In the experiments of Stanley Krippner [J134] image transmission was studied while receiver was
asleep.
Experimenter, sender and volunteer met each other in the beginning of the experiment.
Sender spent the night concentrating on an art print, which he/she had received in the beginning
of the experiment in a closed envelope. The brain waves and eye movements of the volunteer were

2.5. Various types of conscious experiences
85
recorded. The experimenter woke the volunteer at the end of the REM period by intercom and the
volunteer described the dream.
A correlation between the contents of the dream and of the art print was observed. The score
was higher on nights, when there were few or no electric storms in the area and sunspot activity was
lowest.
The simplest interpretation is again in terms of fusion of mental images of the subject persons.
These mental images are perhaps represented at the personal magnetic sensory canvas.
Electric
storms and sunspot activity aﬀect directly Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld and should aﬀect the communication
mechanism since the experiments of Blackman and other suggest that em selves could correspond to
magnetic transition frequencies associated with magnetic ﬁeld of .2 Gauss which is near to the nominal
value .5 Gauss of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. In fact, there exists independent evidence for a general
correlation of geomagnetic activity with psi experiences [J101] .
3. The experiments of J. Grinberg-Zylverbaum
In the experiments of J. Grinberg-Zylverbaum [J57] the transfer of EEG potentials was studied.
Two subject persons were involved. They were closed in Faraday cages. The sender was meditating.
Another subject person was subject to a stimulus in random intervals; not even the experimenter
knew, when they were applied. Non-stimulated subject person was in a relaxed state. Stimulus was
sudden, short light or sound or short electric shock to index and ring ﬁngers of the right hand causing
a characteristic pattern in the EEG of the stimulated person.
The EEG’s of the subject persons were synchroninized.
The possible presence of transferred
potentials in the EEG of nonstimulated subject was studied. Transferred potentials were detected
in 25 percent of all cases provided persons had met before the experiment. A dramatic example was
young couple, deeply in love, whose EEGs remained synchronized throughout the experiment.
The fusion of ELF selves means synchronization of ELF em ﬁelds and since ELF selves correspond
directly to EEG frequencies, synchronization of EEGs is an immediate consequence and can transfer
the synchronous ﬁring in brain circuit of the sender to corresponding brain circuit of the receiver.
The personal contact before the experiment certainly enchanges the probablity for the fusion of ELF
selves. Also quantum entanglement between sub-selves of subject persons might be involved.
It is known that the EEGs of right and left brain are synchronized in deep meditation. There are
also experiments of synchronization of EEGs for diﬀerent subjects in group meditation [J49] . The
explanation is same as in above case. Also quantum entanglement might be involved. For instance,
quantum entanglement is crucial for the fusion of left and right perceptive ﬁelds to single perceptive
ﬁeld.
4. Telesomatic eﬀects
Also the tansfer of actual bodily eﬀects from subject person to another has been studied: references
to these experiments can be found in [J79] . Physiological changes are found to be triggered in the
targeted person by the mental process of another. Distance makes little of no diﬀerence. Thus the
interpretation in terms of quantum entanglement suggests itself.
There are also reports of the transference of pain between persons having very close mutual relation-
ship. Identical twins, mothers and their sons or daughers, couples in love, etc,. Also the relationship
between psychiatrist and patient provides example of this kind and is known as projective identiﬁca-
tion. The general rule seems to the that the relationship between inviduals is always involved with
psi eﬀects. This is in accordance with the hypothesis about sharing of mental images having ELF
em ﬁelds and ﬁeld bodies as physical correlates. For instance, the ﬁeld bodies of persons in an inti-
mate relationhip might develop gradually direct contacts (say magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting physical
bodies).
5. Grof’s experience with altered states of consciousness
Findings of modern psychotherapists, especially the work of Stanislav Grof [J79, J70] suggest
that besides the ordinary ’biographic-recollective’ domain of psyche also perinatal and transpersonal
domains of psyche exist. Transpersonal domain can mediate connection between our mind and prac-
tically any part or aspect of the phenomenal world. Grof studied for several decades altered states of
consciousness induced by psychedelic drugs or holotropic breathing.
In the experience of ’dual unity’, loosening and melting of the boundaries of the body ego happens
but in the merging with another person, own identity is not lost. In the identiﬁcation with another

86
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
person loss of own identity occurs. Body image, physical sensations, emotional reactions and attitudes,
thought processes, memories, facial expressions, typical gestures and mannerisms, postures, movement
and even the inﬂection of the voice become those of the second person. The other can be someone in
the presence or absent. Identiﬁcation involving time shift is also possible. Part of an experience can
come from subject’s childhood, his or her ancestry or even of a previous lifetime.
Also group identiﬁcation and group consciousness is possible. Person can identify with an entire
group of people having some racial, cultural, national, ideolological, religional, political or professional
characteristics. People may experience the totality of suﬀering of all the soldiers or tenderness of all
lovers and dedication of all mothers in regard to their babies.
Identiﬁcation with animals is possible. This involves body image, speciﬁc physiological sensations,
instinctual drives, unique perceptions of the environment, emotional reactions, etc.. Person can iden-
tify with plants and botanical processes. Also identiﬁcation with inorganic world can occur. People
can identify with rivers, storms, tornadoes, mountains,.... Or stones, quartz crystals, minerals.... Even
the identiﬁcation with structures of atomic and sub-atomic world is claimed to be possible. At the
second end of spectrum are racial and collective experiences and identiﬁcation with entire human
species and the experiences in which one identiﬁes with the whole Earth or even entire cosmos. Also
out of body experiences, clairvoyance, clairaudience and telepathy are common. Displacement in time
is possible. Patient can have embryonical and fetal experiences and even ancestral experiences as well
as past incarnation experiences.
Identiﬁcation experiences can be generally understood as sharing and fusion of mental images.
The fusion of mental images can occur between very many inviduals, say members of a species and
would give rise to kind of stereo consciousness analogous to the stereo vision resulting in the fusion
of left and right visual ﬁelds. We could also share this stereo consciousness: for instance, shamanist
could share the mental images of animal species.
Perinatal experiences and memories extending beyond the lifetime of individual could be explained
in terms of geometric memory and the notion of 4-dimensional body: actually these experiences do not
in any signiﬁcant manner diﬀer from ordinary memories. The content of the conscious experience is
multilocal both in subjective and geometric time in the sense that the experience contains contributions
from several moments of geometric time simultaneously.
Our personal self hierarchy could actually contain higher levels than the levels represented by ELF
emf ﬁelds associated with EEG. This hypothesis makes sense if the contribution of the higher levels of
our self hierarchy to our conscious experience under normal circumstances is only some kind of general
awareness (’silent observer’). These higher levels could actually explain the experienced continuity of
self. For instance, during sleep there there would be some kind of basic awareness present: the lack
of memories about sleep state would lead to, in this framework, erraneous conclusion that sleep state
is unconscious.

Boolean mind, cognition and intentionality
2.6.1
Fermions and Boolean cognition
Fermionic Fock state basis deﬁnes naturally a quantum version of Boolean algebra. In zero energy
ontology predicting that physical states have vanishing net quantum numbers, positive and negative
energy components of zero energy states with opposite fermion numbers deﬁne realizations of Boolean
functions via time-like quantum entanglement. One can also consider an interpretation of zero energy
states in terms of rules of form A →B with the instances of A and B represented as elements Fock
state basis ﬁxed by the diagonalization of the density matrix deﬁned by M−-matrix. Hence Boolean
conciousness would be basic aspect of zero energy states. Physical states would be more like memes
than matter. Note also that the fundamental super-symmetric duality between bosonic degrees of
freedom (size and shape of the 3-surface) and fermionic degrees of freedom would correspond to the
sensory-cognitive duality.
This would explain why Boolean and temporal causalities are so closely related. Note that zero
energy ontology is certainly consistent with the usual positive energy ontology if unitary process U
associated with the quantum jump is more or less trivial in the degrees of freedom usually assigned
with the material world. There are arguments suggesting that U is tensor product of of factoring
S-matrices associated with 2-D integrable QFT theories [K16] : these are indeed almost trivial in

2.6. Boolean mind, cognition and intentionality

momentum degrees of freedom. This would also imply that our geometric past is rather stable so that
quantum jump of geometric past does not suddenly change your profession from that of musician to
that of physicist. The maximal diagonality of U-matrix for p-adic-to-real transitions would in turn
favor precise realization of intentions as actions. One must however take this kind of arguments with
extreme caution.
2.6.2
Fuzzy logic, quantum groups, and Jones inclusions
Matrix logic [A23] emerges naturally when one calculates expectation values of logical functions de-
ﬁned by the zero energy states with positive energy fermionic Fock states interpreted as inputs and
corresponding negative energy states interpreted as outputs. Also the non-commutative version of the
quantum logic, with spinor components representing amplitudes for truth values replaced with non-
commutative operators, emerges naturally. The ﬁnite resolution of quantum measurement generalizes
to a ﬁnite resolution of Boolean cognition and allows description in terms of Jones inclusions N ⊂M
of inﬁnite-dimensional Cliﬀord algebras of the world of classical worlds (WCW) identiﬁable in terms
of fermionic oscillator algebras. N deﬁnes the resolution in the sense that quantum measurement and
conscious experience does not distinguish between states diﬀering from each other by the action of N.
The ﬁnite-dimensional quantum Cliﬀord algebra M/N creates the physical states modulo the
resolution. This algebra is non-commutative which means that corresponding quantum spinors have
non-commutative components.
The non-commutativity codes for the that the spinor components
are correlated: the quantized fractal dimension for quantum counterparts of 2-spinors satisfying d =
2cos(π/n) ≤2 expresses this correlation as a reduction of eﬀective dimension.
The moduli of spinor components however commute and have interpretation as eigenvalues of
truth and false operators or probabilities that the statement is true/false.
They have quantized
spectrum having also interpretation as probabilities for truth values and this spectrum diﬀers from
the spectrum {1, 0} for the ordinary logic so that fuzzy logic results from the ﬁnite resolution of
Boolean cognition [K92] .
2.6.3
p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intentionality
p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intentionality provides a further element of TGD inspired
theory of consciousness. At the fundamental level light-like 3-surfaces are basic dynamical objects
in TGD Universe and have interpretation as orbits of partonic 2-surfaces. The generalization of the
notion of number concept by fusing real numbers and various p-adic numbers to a more general
structure makes possible to assign to real parton a p-adic prime p and corresponding p-adic partonic
3-surface obeying same algebraic equations. The almost topological QFT property of quantum TGD
is an essential prerequisite for this. The intersection of real and p-adic 3-surfaces would consists of a
discrete set of points with coordinates which are algebraic numbers. p-Adic partons would relate to
both intentionality and cognition.
The transformation of p-adic variant of the partonic 3-surface with bosonic quantum numbers to
its real counterpart in quantum jump would represent a transformation of intention to action and
the unitary matrix U would govern this process. The larger the number of algebraic points in the
intersection, the more precise the realization of intention as action would be.
Real fermion and its p-adic counterpart forming a pair would represent matter and its cognitive
representation being analogous to a fermion-hole pair resulting when fermion is kicked out from Dirac
sea. The larger the number of points in the intersection of real and p-adic surfaces, the better the
resolution of the cognitive representation would be. This would explain why cognitive representations
in the real world are always discrete (discreteness of numerical calculations represent the basic example
about this fundamental limitation).
All transcendental p-adic integers are inﬁnite as real numbers and one can say that most points of
p-adic space-time sheets are at spatial and temporal inﬁnity in the real sense so that intentionality and
cognition would be literally cosmic phenomena. If the intersection of real and p-adic space-time sheet
contains large number of points, the continuity and smoothness of p-adic physics should directly reﬂect
itself as long range correlations of real physics realized as p-adic fractality. It would be possible to
measure the correlates of cognition and intention and in the framework of zero energy ontology [K16]
the success of p-adic mass calculations can be seen as a direct evidence for the role of intentionality

88
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
and cognition even at elementary particle level: all matter would be basically created by intentional
action as zero energy states.
2.6.4
Inﬁnite primes, cognition and intentionality
Somehow it is obvious that inﬁnite primes must have some very deep role to play in quantum TGD and
TGD inspired theory of consciousness. What this role precisely is has remained an enigma although
I have considered several detailed interpretations, one of them above.
In the following an interpretation allowing to unify the views about fermionic Fock states as a rep-
resentation of Boolean cognition and p-adic space-time sheets as correlates of cognition is discussed.
Very brieﬂy, real and p-adic partonic 3-surfaces serve as space-time correlates for the bosonic super
algebra generators, and pairs of real partonic 3-surfaces and their algebraically continued p-adic vari-
ants as space-time correlates for the fermionic super generators. Intentions/actions are represented
by p-adic/real bosonic partons and cognitions by pairs of real partons and their p-adic variants and
the geometric form of Fermi statistics guarantees the stability of cognitions against intentional action.
It must be emphasized that this interpretation is not identical with the one discussed above since it
introduces diﬀerent identiﬁcation of the space-time correlates of inﬁnite primes.
Inﬁnite primes very brieﬂy
Inﬁnite primes have a decomposition to inﬁnite and ﬁnite parts allowing an interpretation as a many-
particle state of a super-symmetric arithmetic quantum ﬁeld theory for which fermions and bosons
are labelled by primes. There is actually an inﬁnite hierarchy for which inﬁnite primes of a given
level deﬁne the building blocks of the inﬁnite primes of the next level. One can map inﬁnite primes
to polynomials and these polynomials in turn could deﬁne space-time surfaces or at least light-like
partonic 3-surfaces appearing as solutions of Chern-Simons action so that the classical dynamics would
not pose too strong constraints.
The simplest inﬁnite primes at the lowest level are of form mBX/sF + nBsF , X = Q
i pi (product
of all ﬁnite primes). The simplest interpretation is that X represents Dirac sea with all states ﬁlled
and X/sF + sF represents a state obtained by creating holes in the Dirac sea. mB, nB, and sF are
deﬁned as mB = Q
i pmi
i , nB = Q
i qni
i , and sF = Q
i qi, mB and nB have no common prime factors.
The integers mB and nB characterize the occupation numbers of bosons in modes labelled by pi and
qi and sF = Q
i qi characterizes the non-vanishing occupation numbers of fermions.
The simplest inﬁnite primes at all levels of the hierarchy have this form. The notion of inﬁnite
prime generalizes to hyper-quaternionic and even hyper-octonionic context and one can consider the
possibility that the quaternionic components represent some quantum numbers at least in the sense
that one can map these quantum numbers to the quaternionic primes.
The obvious question is whether conﬁguration space degrees of freedom and conﬁguration space
spinor (Fock state) of the quantum state could somehow correspond to the bosonic and fermionic parts
of the hyper-quaternionic generalization of the inﬁnite prime. That hyper-quaternionic (or possibly
hyper-octonionionic primes would deﬁne as such the quantum numbers of fermionic super generators
does not make sense.
It is however possible to have a map from the quantum numbers labelling
super-generators to the ﬁnite primes. One must also remember that the inﬁnite primes considered are
only the simplest ones at the given level of the hierarchy and that the number of levels is inﬁnite.
Algebraic Brahman=Atman identity
The proposed view about cognition and intentionality emerges from the notion of inﬁnite primes [K78] ,
which was actually the ﬁrst genuinely new mathematical idea inspired by TGD inspired consciousness
theorizing. Inﬁnite primes, integers, and rationals have a precise number theoretic anatomy. For
instance, the simplest inﬁnite primes correspond to the numbers P± = X ±1, where X = Q
k pk is the
product of all ﬁnite primes. Indeed, P± mod p = 1 holds true for all ﬁnite primes. The construction
of inﬁnite primes at the ﬁrst level of the hierarchy is structurally analogous to the quantization of
super-symmetric arithmetic quantum ﬁeld theory with ﬁnite primes playing the role of momenta
associated with fermions and bosons. Also the counterparts of bound states emerge. This process can
be iterated: at the second level the product of inﬁnite primes constructed at the ﬁrst level replaces X
and so on.

2.7. Quantum correlates of qualia
89
The structural similarity with repeatedly second quantized quantum ﬁeld theory strongly suggests
that physics might in some sense reduce to a number theory for inﬁnite rationals M/N and that
second quantization could be followed by further quantizations. As a matter fact, the hierarchy of
space-time sheets could realize this endless second quantization geometrically and have also a direct
connection with the hierarchy of logics labeled by their order. This could have rather breathtaking
implications.
1. One is forced to ask whether this hierarchy corresponds to a hierarchy of realities for which level
below corresponds in a literal sense inﬁnitesimals and the level next above to inﬁnity.
2. Second implication is that there is an inﬁnite number of inﬁnite rationals behaving like real units
(M/N ≡1 in real sense) so that space-time points could have inﬁnitely rich number theoretical
anatomy not detectable at the level of real physics. Inﬁnite integers would correspond to positive
energy many particle states and their inverses (inﬁnitesimals with number theoretic structure)
to negative energy many particle states and M/N ≡1 would be a counterpart for zero energy
ontology to which oneness and emptiness are assigned in mysticism.
3. Single space-time point, which is usually regarded as the most primitive and completely irre-
ducible structure of mathematics, would take the role of Platonia of mathematical ideas being
able to represent in its number theoretical structure even the quantum state of entire Universe.
Algebraic Brahman=Atman identity and algebraic holography would be realized in a rather
literal sense.
This number theoretical anatomy should relate to mathematical consciousness in some manner.
For instance, one can ask whether it makes sense to speak about quantum jumps changing the number
theoretical anatomy of space-time points and whether these quantum jumps give rise to mathematical
ideas. In fact, the identiﬁcations of Platonia as spinor ﬁelds in WCW on one hand and as the set
number theoretical anatomies of point of imbedding space force the conclusion that conﬁguration space
spinor ﬁelds (recall also the identiﬁcation as correlates for logical mind) can be realized in terms of the
space for number theoretic anatomies of imbedding space points. Therefore quantum jumps would be
correspond to changes in anatomy of the space-time points. Imbedding space would be experiencing
genuine number theoretical evolution. The whole physics would reduce to the anatomy of numbers.
All mathematical notions which are more than mere human inventions would be imbeddable to the
Platonia realized as the number theoretical anatomies of single imbedding space point.
In [K17, K78] a concrete realization of this vision is discussed by assuming hyper-octonionic inﬁnite
primes as a starting point. In this picture associativity and commutativity are assigned only to inﬁnite
integers representing many particle states but not necessarily to inﬁnite primes themselves: this
guarantees the well-deﬁnedness of the space-time surface assigned to the inﬁnite rational. Quantum
states are required to be associative in the sense that they correspond to quantum super-positions of
all possible associations for the products of (inﬁnite) primes (say |A(BC)⟩+ |(AB)C⟩). The ground
states of super conformal representations would correspond to inﬁnite primes mappable to space-time
surfaces (quantum classical correspondence). The excited states of super-conformal representations
would be represented as quantum entangled states in the tensor product of state spaces Hhk formed
from Schr¨odinger amplitudes in discrete subsets of the space of 8 real units associated with imbedding
space 8 coordinates at point hk: the interpretation is in terms of a 8-fold tensor power of basic
super-conformal representation. Although the representations are not completely local at the level
of imbedding space, they involve only a discrete set of points identiﬁable as arguments of n-point
function. The basic symmetries of the standard model reduce to number theory if hyper-octonionic
inﬁnite rationals are allowed. Color conﬁnement reduces to rationality of inﬁnite integers representing
many particle states.
2.7
Quantum correlates of qualia
The basic theoretical ingredients described above lead to the following general vision about qualia
described in detail in [K28] . In the following the latest view about theory is summarized. The notion
of quale is understood in an extremely general sense: ’primary attribute of conscious experience’ might
serve as a synonym for ’quale’ in the sense as it is used in the following.

Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
2.7.1
Development of ideas
To achieve something which would deserve to be called a general theory of qualia required almost a
decade. During the ﬁrst years, and in lack of any general theory of qualia, I could only make educated
guesses, which were doomed to be wrong.
1. A connection between qualia and EEG MEs emerged, when I learned about the eﬀects of clas-
sical electromagnetic ﬁelds on brain at frequencies which are cyclotron frequencies or amplitude
modulated by cyclotron frequencies [J139] .
2. The discovery that p-adic physics is physics of cognition (or at least imagination, one should be
very cautious in order to avoid over generalizations!) clariﬁed the views about the relationship
between cognition and sensory experience [K52] .
3. The notion of the many-sheeted ionic ﬂow equilibrium was a further important breakthrough
[K10, K11] . It allowed to realize that MEs, superconducting magnetic ﬂux tubes, and ordinary
biomatter at atomic space-time sheets form a three-levelled master-slave hierarchy.
4. The realization that MEs carrying super-symplectic representations at their lightlike boundaries
are excellent candidates for the carriers of at least some of our qualia, gave a totally new
perspective to the problem of qualia [K55] . It seems however that MEs are not all that is
needed: our qualia involve both super-symplectic and magnetic quantum phase transitions.
5. The work with the problems related to the precise formulation of Negentropy Maximization
Principle led to the realization that each quantum jump deﬁnes a quantum measurement followed
by a state preparation leading to an unentangled product state. This means the reduction of
the quantum measurement theory to basic quantum TGD. The next realization was that the
quantum jump sequence deﬁning self deﬁnes a statistical ensemble of prepared states. One can
identify the fundamental statistical ensembles of statistical physics as selves and implied a deep
and precise connection between thermodynamics and the theory of qualia allowing a general
classiﬁcation of qualia and an identiﬁcation of their thermodynamical correlates.
6. The last breakthrough in development, which is still continuing, was the realization that very
general arguments lead to the view that ultimate (conscious-to-us) sensory representations are
realized outside the body on the magnetic canvas provided by the magnetic ﬂux tube structures
associated with brain and having most plausibly size for which Earth size as a natural unit. One
can see cortex as a collection of standard features some of which are associated to the objects of
the perceptive ﬁeld represented as magnetic sub-selves. Frequency place coding (MEs generate
magnetic quantum phase transitions) plays a key role in this association.
Music metaphor at axonal level
Music metaphor has been one philosophical quideline behind the identiﬁcation of the quantum corre-
lates of the sensory qualia.
1. Axons are like strings of a music instrument. What this metaphor means is however not obvious.
Frequency coding relates only the intensity of the sensory quale. Nerve pulses induce dropping
of various ions to magnetic ﬂux tubes and this generates EEG MEs at EEG frequencies serving
as entanglers to the sensory magnetic canvas and the variation of these frequencies could code
for the distance to the object of the perceptive ﬁeld.
A stronger interpretation of the metaphor is that sensory pathways are like strings of a musical
instrument such that the sound produced by the string corresponds to a sensory modality asso-
ciated with the sensory pathway. Nerve pulse patterns determine the experience as chords from
from the notes of various instruments in the same sense as the musician produces the music.
This leads to a generalization of the idea about brain as an associative net.
More concretely, postsynaptic receptors act as neuronal sensory receptors and transmitters emit-
ted and MEs generated by the presynaptic neuron induce neuronal sensory experiences in the
postsynaptic neuron. The specialization of the neuronal receptors would be same for the entire
sensory pathway and determine the qualia associated with it.

2.7. Quantum correlates of qualia
91
2. Resonance is an essential aspect of music instrument as is resonant frequency modulation which
can involve several levels. The frequencies characterizing the hierarchical modulation provides a
partial characterization of the sensory representations. Quantum mechanically resonance corre-
sponds to a harmonic perturbation with frequency which is diﬀerence of energies for the states
of some sub-system. In this kind of situation quantum jumps can be ampliﬁed to quantum phase
transitions and sub-self representing mental image wakes up.
Unfortunately, music metaphor is only a metaphor and has led to a plethora of various models for
qualia.
ME’s and qualia
The identiﬁcation of MEs as building blocks of sensory and cognitive structures leads to a rather
concrete model for long term memory and forces the hypothesis that MEs deﬁne an inﬁnite hierarchy
of electromagnetic life forms living in symbiosis with each other, magnetic ﬂux tube structures, and
the matter at atomic space-time sheets. The realization that MEs serve as quantum holograms and
the properties of the super-symplectic stats gave the ﬁnal justiﬁcation for this identiﬁcation. The
model allows to understand EEG as a direct physical correlate of mindlike space-times sheets (MEs)
associated with ELF selves and provides a general vision about the electromagnetic organization of
brain as sensory and motor organ of higher level self. Also what might be called RF (radiofrequency)
and MW (microwave) MEs representing our mental images are crucial for the model.
The model of qualia leads to rather detailed view about the sizes of the hierarchy of various MEs
deﬁning what might be called our radiation body. Also the notion of magnetic body is needed. It
took a long time to answer the question whether we should identify ourselves with the self associated
with brain; with the entire body; with ELF ME having size at least of order Earth circumference;
or with self having literally inﬁnite size. The last two options seems to be more plausible than the
ﬁrst two: the illusion that we are nothing but our physical bodies is created by the fact that during
wake-up state sensory input is about the region surrounding our body. The simplest option is that
the relevant magnetic ﬂux tube structures have same sizes as ELF MEs. During sleep our attention
might be directed to transpersonal levels of consciousness.
MEs, magnetic superconductors, and many-sheeted ionic ﬂow equilibrium
The lack of clearcut empirical evidence for the predicted supra phases has been a stumbling block
for the quantitative development of the theory for a long time. The situation changed dramatically
when I learned about the eﬀects of ELF em ﬁelds on living matter4.
This article provided the
ingredients making possible a general quantitative model of quantum control and coordination in
which self hierarchy has as its dynamical correlate hierarchy of weakly coupled super conductors and
massless extremals (MEs) interacting with the ordinary matter at atomic space-time sheets. MEs
indeed provide a model of Josephson junction and an explanation for the amplitude windows observed
in the experiments of Blackman and others [J44] .
Later the experimental ﬁndings challenging the notions of ionic channels and pumps [I31] led to the
identiﬁcation of homeostasis as many-sheeted ionic ﬂow equilibrium in which the ionic concentrations
at atomic space-time sheets are controlled by much smaller ionic concentrations at superconducting
magnetic ﬂux tubes. MEs control superconducting magnetic ﬂux tubes via magnetic induction, by
inducing magnetic phase transitions and by acting as Josephson junctions between magnetic ﬂux
tubes.
Magnetic transitions at superconducting magnetic ﬂux tubes serve as seeds for phase transitions in
quantum critical quantum spin glass type phase of macroscopic super conductor leading to generation
of a region of new kind of phase whose quantum numbers diﬀer from old one by the quantum numbers
associated with magnetic transition frequency. Thus quantum transitions are ampliﬁed to macroscopic
quantum transitions and Bose-Einstein condensation (analogous to induced emission) is the basic
mechanism behind the process.
The ﬁrst natural guess was that magnetic quantum phase transitions correspond to our qualia.
That transition frequencies are involved is indeed in nice accordance with quantum jumps between
histories as moment of consciousness identiﬁcation. However, the fact that magnetic states correspond

92
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
to a lower level of abstraction than super-symplectic states associated with MEs, suggests that mag-
netic qualia do not correspond to our qualia directly. Rather primitive chemical qualia experienced
by cell level selves might be in question.
The role of super-symplectic algebra
An important step in the development of the theory of qualia was the realization of the importance
of super-symplectic symmetries.
The answer to this question might have been guessed by taking
quantum measurement theory as a starting point.
1. Basic geometric objects is the conﬁguration space of all possible three-surfaces in M 4
+ × CP2.
In absence of non-determinism of K¨ahler action everything would reduce to the boundary of the
future lightcone (δM 4
+ × CP2) carrying representations of super-symplectic and superconformal
algebra localized with respect to the ligthlike radial coordinate of the lightcone boundary. These
symmetries are obviously cosmological.
Also quaternion conformal symmetries are possible
and these can be identiﬁed as the TGD counterparts of string model conformal symmetries
responsible for elementary particle quantum numbers.
2. The non-determinism of K¨ahler action forces to introduce super-symplectic representations at the
lightlike boundaries X3 of MEs acting as quantum holograms. Thus superconformal and super-
symplectic symmetries become macroscopic symmetries and must be crucial for consciousness.
3. There are two kinds of conﬁguration space degrees of freedom: quantum ﬂuctuating non-zero
modes and zero modes which can be regarded as classical, non-quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of
freedom in complete consistency with the reduction of standard quantum measurement theory to
the localization in zero modes occurring in each quantum jump. Zero mode algebra cointains the
generators of super-symplectic algebra with even conformal weight. In particular, zero modes
contain the points of an inﬁnite-dimensional ﬂag-manifold extended to contain the radial Vira-
soro algebra of the lightlike boundary of ME localized with respect to CP2. Radial coordinate
corresponds to the lightlike coordinate of the the lightlike boundary of ME. This ﬂag-manifold
parametrizes all possible choices of the quantization axes for the canonical Lie-algebra.
2.7.2
Qualia and thermodynamics
The connection between thermodynamics and qualia was the real breakthrough in the development
of ideas.
In some sense this ﬁnding is not a news: the close connection between pressure sense
and temperature sense and thermodynamics is basic facts of psychophysics. In TGD framework the
contents of consciousness is determined as some kind of average over the sequence of very large number
of quantum jump and this suggests strongly that non-geometric qualia allow statistical description
generalizing ordinary thermodynamical ensemble to the ensemble formed by the prepared states in
the sequence of quantum jumps after the last ’wake-up’ of self. This picture allows to see the ageing
of self with respect to subjective time as an approach to thermal equilibrium.
1. There are geometric qualia corresponding to zero modes expressing the result of quantum mea-
surement in each quantum jump. All geometric information about space-time surface should
reduce to geometric qualia. For instance, geometric data given by visual, auditory, and tactile
senses should reduce to conscious information about zero modes or about increments of zero
modes in quantum jump.
2. The sequence of the prepared states can be modelled as a statistical ensemble of Fock states,
which suggests that thermodynamics is basically part of theory of consciousness. The ensemble
of prepared states gives rise to a large number of statistical qualia. The relationship dE =
TdS −PdV + µdN + B · dM... generalizes to TGD context: note however that in case of ME
selves energy is replaced with the Super Virasoro generator L0 associated with the lightcone
boundary of ME. Each intensive-extensive variable pair in the diﬀerential should correspond to
a non-geometric quale, which results only when there is gradient (ﬂow) of the extensive variable
in the direction of the subjective time. Super-symplectic thermodynamics should obviously map
ordinary thermodynamics to the level of conscious experience.

2.7. Quantum correlates of qualia
93
3. Since subjective experience corresponds to quantum jumps, it is natural to assume that only
the increments of zero modes and quantum numbers are experienced consciously. Statistical
interpretation also suggests that an averaging over increments occurs. The possibility of sub-
selves makes possible to have mental images of ﬁnite time duration and this makes possible
structured subjective memories (for instance, it becomes possible to remember the digits of
phone number). A further working hypothesis is universality: qualia associated with quantum
phase transitions depend only on the quantum number increments. In particular, the increments
of Poincare and color and electroweak quantum numbers deﬁne what might be called universal
kinestetic qualia.
The thermodynanical expression for dE suggests a general classiﬁcation of qualia consistent with
the ’holy trinity’ of existences implied by TGD.
1. Emotions as order-disorder qualia
T −S pair correspond subjective existence and generalizes to disorder-order type, information
theoretic qualia qualia about the state of self: hot-cold and pain-pleasure type sensations and also
more abstract experiences associated with various sub-selves of self. These qualia are strongly emo-
tional single-pixel holistic qualia measuring whether some kind of an entropy variable is increasing or
decreasing. The total entropy for the statistical ensemble deﬁned by self determines how sharp the
the mental image is. Low entropy content means alertness and attentiveness. High entropy content
means fuzzy mental image. Getting tired means inability to keep mental images in low entropy state.
2. Kinestetic qualia deﬁned by generalized forces
p-V pair corresponds to the geometric existence and is replaced with generalized force-generalized
coordinate pairs in quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom. The increments of maximum number
of mutually commuting Poincare, color and electroweak quantum numbers deﬁne this kind of qualia.
The increments of four-momentum code for the sensation of force whereas the increments of orbital
angular momentum code for the sensation of torque. Spin ﬂip could code for something else. Tactile
senses such as pressure sense and their generalizations involve kinestetic qualia. The increment of
energy or equivalently, increment of frequency, can be identiﬁed as correlate for hearing in generalized
sense responsible for the dynamical nature of auditory experience (hearing is timelike version of force
sense). It is not clear whether spin ﬂip has interpretation as torque or possibly as ﬁgure background
separation. In TGD based model of auditory experience hearing relates to Z0 magnetic spin ﬂip phase
transitions for cognitive neutrino pairs.
The rate for the increase of the two diagonal color quantum numbers should code intensity type
variables associated with color sensation. The rate for the increase of electric charge of sub-self should
code for electric sense possessed by, say, ﬁshes. Also B −M, φρ and E −P pairs correspond to
generalized forces since electromagnetic ﬁelds are reduced to space-time geometry in TGD framework.
3. Generalized chemical qualia vm
µ −N pair corresponds to ’objective existence’ deﬁned by quantum histories and N is generalized
to a number of particle like excitations in the Fock state resulting in the state preparation. In this case
there must be a ﬂow of particle number in the direction of the subjective time, that is Bose-Einstein
condensation type process for, say Cooper pairs. Quite generally, super-symplectic and quaternion
conformal super algebras should deﬁne these qualia and the number of these qualia is very large.
i) One can assign particle numbers to phases with various magnetic quantum numbers and these
could deﬁne generalized chemical qualia which could perhaps be regarded as qualia and subqualia of
chemical qualia deﬁned by a particular ion and chemical qualia could actually reduce to magnetic
qualia. Since the changes of magnetic ﬁeld induce these quantum phase transition, it would seem
that magnetic and Z0 magnetic quantum phase transitions at superconducting magnetic ﬂux tubes
could correspond to this kind of qualia. In principle, endogenous NMR and its generalizations induced
by the interaction of magnetic and Z0 magnetic ﬁelds of MEs with magnetic and Z0 magnetic ﬂux
tube structures are possible. Chemical qualia would very naturally correspond to the Bose-Einstein
condensation of ions to the superconducting magnetic ﬂux tubes: these ions could be even the ions of
tastant or odorant. Also secondary representations at the level of cortex in terms of superconducting
light ions are possible and would give rise to classiﬁcation of tastes and odours. Magnetic qualia
are characterized by deﬁnite transition frequencies and this makes possible place-/time coding by

94
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
magnetic transition frequencies if magnetic or Z0 magnetic ﬁeld varies along magnetic ﬂux tube/is a
function of time. The activation of a point of living map would generate some quale at that point.
ii) For super-symplectic qualia the number of Bose-Einstein condensed ’conﬁguration space pho-
tons’ having nontrivial dependence on conﬁguration space degrees of freedom replaces number of
molecules. The condensation rates for the numbers of the conﬁguration space photons with nonvan-
ishing color quantum numbers could be interpreted as correlates of color qualia whereas the condensa-
tion rates for color singlet conﬁguration space photons could relate to the intensity of color sensation.
If the rates for the trasfer of color quantum numbers deﬁne intensity type variables associated with
color experience then BE condensation to color singlet states does not give rise to experienced quale
so that only non-diagonal color generators correspond to visual colors. Also the BE condensation of
the ordinary coherent light should give rise to some kind of quale: perhaps vibratory sense which can
be developed to eﬀective vision, could correspond to non-colored vision. Conﬁguration space Hamil-
tonians are also labelled by 2-dimensional orbital spin quantum number and longitudinal momentum.
Polarization sense and sensation about motion of the object of visual ﬁeld would naturally relate to
spin and longitudinal momentum.
iii) Tactile senses involve topological phase transitions involving the creation of join along bound-
aries contacts between object and skin whose number would thus be the relevant variable. The purely
sensory aspect of physical pain could correspond to a topological phase transition involving the split-
ting of join-along boundaries bonds between space-time sheets (MEs could even deﬁne these bonds)
so that N would be now the number of join along boundaries bonds. The simplest picture requires
that the MEs associated with sensory organs are connected to the MEs responsible for our experience.
Of course, splitting and generation of join along boundaries contacts could occur also at the level of
sensory representations.
4. Boolean qualia
Boolean qualia
Boolean qualia would be naturally associated with fermion number or fermionic spin degrees of free-
dom.
There are super-symplectic and super-Kac Moody type Boolean qualia.
The spin ﬂipping
transitions associated with the fermionic generators of super-symplectic algebra might give rise to
Boolean consciousness with intrinsic meaning (’This is true’) but there are many other possibilities.
A general model for abstraction process based on the Combinatorial Hierarchy [K31] not only
explains the basic numbers of the genetic code but also suggests an entire hierarchy of codes in
accordance with fractality of TGD Universe.
The next code after genetic code in the hierarchy of codes deﬁned by Combinatorial Hierarchy
is very attractive candidate for a ’memetic code’. The hypothesis predicts correctly the .1 second
time scale for the duration of ’our’ self (immediate short term memory, duration of psychological
moment). Code-words correspond to the sequences of 126 bits with a duration of 1/1260 seconds:
this is slightly below the time scale of nerve pulse so that membrane oscillations are perhaps a more
natural realization for the code. The facts that the time scale of causal diamond CD associated with
d quark corresponds to 1280 Hz frequency and the time scale of electron’s CD corresponds to 10 Hz
frequency suggest that quark pairs allow a realization of the memetic code with single quark sub-CD
representing and electron CD the code word.
2.7.3
Geometric qualia and zero modes
The zero modes of the conﬁguration space are special in the sense that in each quantum jump local-
ization occurs in this space. Zero modes characterize the size and shape of 3-surface and are excellent
candidate to represent information about the state of organism (3-surface itself) geometrically. Zero
modes can be parametrized as an inﬁnite-dimensional ﬂag-manifold associated with the algebra of the
inﬁnitesimal canonical transformations of E2 × CP2, where S2 is sphere at the lightcone boundary
extended by Virasoro algebra acting in radial direction of lightcone boundary. Physically this space
corresponds to all possible choices of the quantization axes for generators of super-symplectic Algebra
and, in accordance with the basic assumptions of quantum measurement theory, each quantum jump
involves this kind of choice. Inﬁnite-dimensional ﬂag manifold contains as sub-ﬂag-manifold S2 × F3
parameterizing choices of quantization axes of spin and color (F3 = SU(3)/U(1) × U(1)). Lorentz

2.8. Solutions to some paradoxes
95
invariance suggests the extension of S2 to 2+2 dimensional ﬂag-manifold F = SO(3, 1)/SO(2) × R
parameterizing various choices of the quantization axes for Lorentz quantum numbers [K28] .
There are continuous, geometric and kinestetic (both geometric in four-dimensional sense) qualia
like position and velocity; orientation and angular velocity, and also geometric time and experienced
rate of time ﬂow. All these pairs correspond to mutually in-compatible observables quantum me-
chanically. The hypothesis motivated by the work of Barbara Shipman [Shipman1,2,3] is that some
coordinates of F3 parametrize positions. The generalization of this hypothesis is that the inﬁnite-
dimensional ﬂag-manifold associated with the zeromode part super-symplectic algebra somehow gives
rise to a conscious representation of continuous, classical qualia basically assignable to the choise of
quantization axes. The hypothesis indeed makes sense: the entire isometry group of the conﬁguration
space, in particular the sub-group deﬁned by zero modes, leaves induced K¨ahler form invariant but
aﬀects magnetic and Z0 magnetic ﬁelds and hence magnetic transition frequencies. Also color rota-
tions act in F3 nontrivially and, although they leave K¨ahler form invariant, they aﬀect magnetic and
Z0 magnetic ﬁelds and thus the corresponding magnetic transition frequencies. This means that a
curve of the inﬁnite-dimensional ﬂag-manifold can be mapped to a varying cyclotron frequency.
2.8
Solutions to some paradoxes
The TGD inspired theory of consciousness provides a solution to the many paradoxes related to the
basic quantum physics and the philosophy of conscious mind. The solution of these paradoxes is
basically due to the replacement of the dualistic and monistic world views by the tripartistic world
view of TGD.
2.8.1
Paradoxes related to quantum physics
The basic paradox is the conﬂict between the non-determinism of the state function reduction and
the determinism of the Schr¨odinger equation. At a more general level this paradox is the conﬂict
between the subjectively experienced actuality of the free will and the determinism of the objective
world. The resolution of this paradox is simple in TGD context. One must give up the idea of single
objective reality and replace it with a deterministic quantum history, which changes in each quantum
jump, which is a genuine act of free will occurring outside the realm of the geometric space-time.
Thus the objective reality, in the sense of a physical theory, is indeed deterministic, apart from the
non-determinism related to the special properties of the K¨ahler action. In fact, a determinism of
the K¨ahler action is achieved by replacing the ordinary concept of the 3-space with the concept of
an association sequence and this naturally leads to a model for thinking systems. Volition seems to
correspond to the selection between various degenerate absolute minima of the K¨ahler action and has
thus a direct classical counterpart.
In the context of the deterministic physics, theoretician encounters two rather unpleasant para-
doxes. The determinism implies that the unique objective reality corresponds to a single solution of
the ﬁeld equations. The ﬁrst question is “What determines the initial conditions, say at the moment
of the big bang?” and the attempt to answer this question leads necesssarily outside the physical
theory: one possibility is to postulate antrophic principle. In TGD objective reality changes at each
quantum jump and the localization in zero modes and NMP imply a genuine evolution: therefore the
recent objective reality is an outcome of conscious selections. The second problem encountered by
a theoretician is that in principle it is not possible to test a deterministic theory since only single
solution of the ﬁeld equations is realized and a genuine testing would require the comparison of the
time developments for various initial data. In practice this problem can be circumvented by assuming
the existence of identical sub-systems having very weak interactions with the external world but in
principle the problem remains unsolved.
The famous Einstein-Bohr debate was related with the question whether God plays dice or not.
Amusingly, in TGD context both were correct in their own ways!
Quantum histories are indeed
deterministic but God can replace the old quantum history with a new one: perhaps one should
not however call this act dice playing but simply an act of free will. Einstein was also an advocate
of local realism: this led to Einstein-Podolski-Rosen paradox created by the possibility of quantum
entanglement between distant system. In TGD framework local realism holds true at the level of the

96
Chapter 2. Matter, Mind, Quantum
inﬁnite-dimensional conﬁguration space but not at the level of space-time since point like particles are
replaced with 3-surfaces.
The Schr¨odinger cat paradox has also an elegant solution in TGD context. The point is that
conscious experience is associated with a quantum jump leading to a ﬁnal state in which cat is either
dead or alive. There is no conscious experience about the situation in which the cat is both dead and
alive giving answer to the question “Dead or alive?”. More generally, this feature of consciousness
also could explain why the world of our conscious experience looks classical: it simply cannot look
but classical since the very moment of consciousness makes it classical. In fact, the world is predicted
to be genuinely classical to the extent that mutual quantum entanglement between diﬀerent p-adic
sub-Universes seems impossible for purely mathematical reasons. The localization into zero modes
occurring in quantum jumps strengthens this conclusion considerably since it implies that the ﬁnal
states of quantum jumps are superpositions of macroscopically equivalent space-time surfaces: the
world of conscious experience is genuinely classical.
The phenomenon of dissipation is paradoxal from the point of view of standard physics. It is
generally accepted that the fundamental laws of classical physics are reversible whereas everyday
reality is manifestly irreversible. Thus the situation is rather schizophrenic. Two worlds, the reversible
and extremely beautiful world of the fundamental physics and the irreversible and mathematically
rather ugly ”real” world, seem to exist simultaneously. The quantum jumps between quantum histories
concept solves the paradox and one can understand the dissipative world as an eﬀective description
forming an ’almost’-envelope for the sequence of reversible worlds (time developments).
The standard physics is based on positive energy ontology and leads to the paradox caused by
conservation laws. Quantum jumps preserve the values of conserved quantum numbers so that the
question about initial values of the quantum numbers arises and leads to the necessity to postulate
some meta level principle selecting the quantum states of entire universe having the preferred values
of total quantum numbers. Of course, the problems are also caused by the fact that one must be able
to compare the inﬁnite values of total conserved quantum numbers- at least in the case of energy.
Zero energy ontology provides an elegant solution of the problem and implies that any zero energy
state is in principle creatable from vacuum.
2.8.2
Paradoxes related to the theories of consciousness
Chalmers describes in his book ’Conscious Mind’ [J42] several paradoxes related to the materialistic
and dualistic theories of mind. A common denominator for these problems is the assumption that
consciousness is a property of a physical state: hence these paradoxes disappear in TGD context. These
paradoxes are encountered also in the quantum theories of consciousness identifying consciousness as
a property of a macroscopic quantum state, say Bose Einstein condensate.
In the materialistic theories of mind, postulating a unique objective reality, consciousness is an
epiphenomenon and free will is necessarily a peculiar illusion and one can always ask why the con-
sciousness is needed at all: nothing changes in the physical reality if consciousness is dropped away.
It is also very diﬃcult to understand how the contents of consciousness are determined by the state
of the material world.
In the dualistic theories postulating a unique objective reality (say the theory of Chalmers [J42]
), the problems are related to the coupling between matter and mind. The basic problem of the
dualistic theories is what Chalmers calls hard problem: how the physical processes in the brain
give rise to conscious experience? If the laws of the physics determine the behaviour of the system
completely then one ends up immediately either with a complete separation of the mind and matter
so that our conscious experience tells nothing about the material world or with materialism and
epiphenomenalism. One can also consider a non-trivial coupling between matter and “mind like”
ﬁelds but assuming a deterministic physics one ends up with a situation in in which the mind ﬁelds
are eﬀectively just additional physical ﬁelds and consciousness is again redundant.
An exotic example of this kind of a paradox is the following one described in [J42] .
In the
dualistic theories in which the physical laws determine the objective reality, all psychological (third
person ) aspects of the mind are in principle purely physical. The book written by Chalmers about
consciousness is obviously an example of a completely physical phenomenon. Therefore the contents of
the book need not have anything to do with Chalmers’s ideas about consciousness! More generally, the
reports about the states of consciousness need not have anything to do with the states of consciousness

2.8. Solutions to some paradoxes
97
in the dualistic theories of this kind. The only manner to save the day (and the uniqueness of the
objective reality) is to accept materialism and epiphenomenalism.
In TGD framework, which could be called tripartistic, hard problem and other problems of the
dualistic theories disappear since there is no need to assign consciousness to quantum history. Mo-
ment of consciousness as quantum jump between quantum histories hypothesis allows even to deﬁne
measures for the information contents of the conscious experience despite the fact that one cannot
write explicit formulas for the contents of conscious experience.
2.8.3
Logical paradoxes and concept of time
Many logical paradoxes could be resolved if one assumes that there are two times: geometric and
subjective and that the space-time surface providing linguistic representations changes quantum jump
by quantum jump. In particular, during the conscious argument leading to the logical paradox!
The objections of Uri Fidelman [J63] against the Platonic vision about reality involve the paradoxes
of the cyclic cosmology (one might think that Turing machine in cyclic cosmology might be able to
’know’ whether it has halted immediately after starting and thus be much more powerful than ordinary
Turing machine). Basic paradox is that in cyclic cosmology allowing time travel one can imagine a
son who murders his mother.
It is interesting to consider this paradox as resulting from identiﬁcation of the identiﬁcation of
subjective time with geometric time, which I see only as an approximation. In TGD the counterpart
of time travel would be sequence of quantum jumps changing the entire classical history quantum jump
by quantum jump and inducing the shift of the space-time region, where the contents of consciousness
of time traveller are concentrated, to the geometric past. No paradoxes result since space-time is not
a ﬁxed arena of dynamics but changes in each quantum jump.
As a second example one can take the second objection of Uri Fidelman [J63] against Penrose’s
program known as Berry’s paradox. Non-formalizable theory cannot provide a model of the physical
world which includes the brain’s cognitive function, since such a model must be lingual, written or
spoken. However, such a model implies the following paradox of Berry: Let n be the smallest number
which cannot be deﬁned by an English sentence having less than, say, a hundred letters. This number
exists, since the number of all possible combinations of a hundred letters is ﬁnite. Nevertheless, it has
just now been deﬁned by a sentence comprising less than a hundred letters.
Berry’s paradox could be understood when the piece of text is seen as inducing a sequence of
quantum jumps in which the space-time region at which the argument is represented symbolically
changes. For the initial space-time region representing my cognitive state there is indeed smallest
number n which cannot be deﬁned by using less than one hundred words (using the English in that
space-time!). After reading the statement quantum history is replaced by a new, more complex one
in which this this number can be deﬁned by using less than one hundred words since a new reﬂective
level of cognitive consciousness has emerged and is represented at space-time level.
This example encourages to think the possibility of replacing the idea of a ﬁxed axiomatic system
with a living and dynamically evolving system becoming conscious of new axioms from which new
theorems can grow. Mathematician would not be anymore an outsider but and active participator
aﬀecting the mathematical system he is studying. For instance, when paradoxal statement represented
symbolically becomes conscious in quantum jump sequence, also the context in which it was originally
stated changes. This dynamical view about mathematical system could allow to solve antinomies.


Chapter 3
Negentropy Maximization Principle
3.1
Introduction
Quantum TGD involves ’holy trinity’ of time developments. There is the geometric time development
dictated by the preferred extremal of K¨ahler action crucial for the realization of General Coordinate
Invariance and analogous to Bohr orbit. There is the unitary ”time development” U: Ψi →UΨi →Ψf,
associated with each quantum jump, which is the counterpart of the Schr¨odinger time evolution
U(−t, t →∞). There is however no actual Schr¨odinger equation involved: situation is in practice
same also in quantum ﬁeld theories. Quantum jump sequence itself deﬁnes what might be called
subjective time development.
Some dynamical principle governing subjective time evolution should exist and explain state func-
tion reduction with the characteristic one-one correlation between macroscopic measurement variables
and quantum degrees of freedom and state preparation process. Negentropy Maximization Principle
is the candidate for this principle, which I have been developing during last ﬁfteen years.
The evolution of ideas related to NMP has been slow and tortuous process characterized by mis-
interpretations, overgeneralizations, and unnecessarily strong assumptions, and has been basically
evolution of ideas related to the anatomy of quantum jump and of quantum TGD itself.
3.1.1
The notion of entanglement entropy
1. The ﬁrst form of NMP was rather naive. There was no idea about the anatomy of quantum
jump and NMP only stated that the allowed quantum jumps are such that the information
gain of conscious experience measured by the reduction of entanglement entropy resulting in the
reduction of entanglement between the subsystem of system and its complement is maximal.
Later it became clear that quantum jump has a complex anatomy consisting of unitary process
U followed by the TGD counterpart of state function reduction serving as a state preparation
for the next quantum jump.
2. The attempts to formulate NMP in p-adic physics led to the realization that one can distinguish
between three kinds of information measures.
(a) In real physics the negative of the entanglement entropy deﬁned by the standard Shannon
formula deﬁnes a natural information measure, which is always non-positive.
(b) In p-adic physics one can generalize this information measure to p-adic valued information
measure by replacing the logarithms of p-adic valued probabilities with the p-based loga-
rithms logp(|P|p) which are integer valued and can be interpreted as p-adic numbers. This
p-adic valued entanglement entropy can be mapped to a non-negative real number by the
so called canonical identiﬁcation x = P
n xnpn →P
n xnp−n. In both cases a non-positive
information measure results.
(c) When the entanglement probabilities are rational numbers or at most ﬁnitely algebraically
extended rational numbers one can still deﬁne logarithms of probabilities as p-based loga-
rithms logp(|P|p) and interpret the entropy as a rational or algebraic number. In this case
the entropy can be however negative and positive deﬁnite information measure is possible.
99

100
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Irrespective of number ﬁeld one can in this case deﬁne entanglement entropy as a maximum
of number theoretic entropies Sp over the set of primes. The ﬁrst proposal was that the
algebraic entanglement corresponds to bound state entanglement turned out to be wrong.
3. At some stage the importance of the almost trivial fact that bound state entanglement must
be kinematically stable against NMP became obvious. One can imagine that the state function
reduction proceeds step by step by reducing the state to two parts in such a manner that the
reduction of entanglement entropy is maximal.
(a) If a resulting subsystem corresponds to a bound state having no decomposition to free
subsystems the process stops for this subsystem. The natural assumption is that subsystems
lose their consciousness when U process leads to bound state entanglement whereas bound
state itself can be conscious.
(b) If the entanglement is negentropic (and thus rational or algebraic) a more natural inter-
pretation consistent with the teaching of spiritual practices is that subsystems experience
a fusion to a larger conscious entity. The negentropic entanglement between free states is
stabilized by NMP and negentropically entangled states need not reside at the bottom of
potential well forbidding the reduction of entanglement. This makes possible new kinds
of correlated states for which binding energy can be negative. Bound state entanglement
would be like the jail of organized marriage and negentropic entanglement like a love mar-
riage in which companions are free to leave but do not what it. The existence of this kind of
negentropic entanglement is especially interesting in living matter, where metabolism (high
energy phosphate bond in particular) and the stability of DNA and other highly charged
polymers is poorly understood physically: negentropic entanglement could be responsible
for stabilization making possible the transfer of metabolic energy [K26] .
4. For the negentropic entanglement the outcome of the state function reduction ceases to be
random as it is for the standard deﬁnition of entanglement entropy. Note however that U process
as a creative act yielding superposition of possibibilities from which state function reduction
selects leaves means non-determinism.
This has far reaching consequences.
Ordinary state
function reductions for an ensemble of systems lead to a generation of thermodynamical entropy
and this explains the second law of thermodynamics. In the case of negentropic entanglement
situation changes and the predicted breaking of second law of thermodynamics provides a new
view to understand self-organization [K69] , and living matter could be identiﬁed as something
residing in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds where p-adic intentions can be transformed
to real actions.
5. One particular choice involved with state function reduction process could be the choice be-
tween generic entanglement and number theoretic entanglement possible only in the intersection
of p-adic and real WCWs. If the choice is the generic entanglement, system ends up either to
an unentangled state with maximal conscious freedom or to a bound state with a loss of con-
sciousness. If the choice is algebraic entanglement, system ends up to negentropic entanglement
and correlations with external world and experiences an expansion of consciousness. Maybe
ethical choices are basically choices between these two options.
Also positive emotions like
love and experience of understanding could directly relate to various aspects of the negentropic
entanglement.
3.1.2
Zero energy ontology
Zero energy ontology changes considerably the interpretation of the unitary process. In zero energy
ontology quantum states are replaced with zero energy states deﬁned as a superpositions of pairs of
positive and negative energy states identiﬁed as counterparts of initial and ﬁnal states of a physical
event such as particle scattering. The matrix deﬁning entanglement between positive and negative
- christened as M-matrix- is the counterpart of the ordinary S-matrix but need not be unitary. It
can be identiﬁed as a ”complex square root” of density matrix expressible as a product of positive
square root of diagonal density matrix and unitary S-matrix. Quantum TGD can be seen as deﬁning
a ”square root” of thermodynamics, which thus becomes an essential part of quantum theory.

3.1. Introduction
101
U-matrix is deﬁned between zero energy states and cannnot therefore be equated with the S-
matrix used to describe particle scattering events. Unitary conditions however imply that U-matrix
can be seen as a collection of M-matrices labelled by zero energy states so that the knowledge of
U-matrix implies the knowledge of M-matrices. The unitarity conditions will be discussed later. A
natural guess is that U is directly related to consciousness and the description of intentional actions.
For positive energy ontology state function reduction would serve as a state preparation for the next
quantum jump. In zero energy ontology state function preparation and reduction can be assigned
to the positive and negative energy states deﬁning the initial and ﬁnal states of the physical event.
The reduction of the time-like entanglement during the state function reduction process corresponds
to the measurement of the scattering matrix. In the case of negentropic time-like entanglement the
reduction process is not random anymore and the resulting dynamics is analogous to that of cellular
automata providing a natural description of the dynamics of self-organization in living matter.
Zero energy ontology leads to a precise identiﬁcation of the subsystem at space-time level. General
coordinate invariance in 4-D sense means that 3-surfaces related by 4-D diﬀeomorphisms are physically
equivalent.
It is conventient to perform a gauge ﬁxing by a introducing a natural choice for the
representatives of the equivalence classes formed by diﬀeo-related 3-surfaces.
1. Light-like 3-surfaces identiﬁed as surfaces at which the Minkowskian signature of the induced
space-time metric changes to Euclidian one - wormhole contacts- are excellent candidates in this
respect. The intersections of these surfaces with the light-like boundaries of CD deﬁned 2-D
partonic surfaces. Also the 3-D space-like ends of space-time sheets at the light-like boundaries
of CDs are very natural candidates for preferred 3-surfaces.
2. The condition that the choices are mutually consistent implies eﬀective 2-dimensionality. The
intersections of these surfaces deﬁning partonic 2-surface plus the distribution of 4-D tangent
spaces at its points deﬁne the basic dynamical objects with 4-D general coordinate invariance
reduced to 2-dimensional one. This eﬀective 2-dimensionality was clear from the very beginning
but is only apparent since also the data about 4-D tangent space distribution is necessary to
characterize the geometry of WCW and quantum states.
The descriptions in terms of 3-D
light-like or space-like surfaces and even in terms of 4-D surfaces are equivalent but redundant
descriptions.
As far as consciousness is considered eﬀective 2-dimensionality means holography and could relate to
the fact that at least our visual experience is at least eﬀectively 2-dimensional.
3.1.3
Connection with standard quantum measurement theory
TGD allows to deduce the standard quantum measurement theory involving the notion of classical
variables and their correlation with quantum numbers in an essential manner. Conﬁguration space (or
”world of classical worlds”, brieﬂy WCW) is a union over zero modes labelling inﬁnite-dimensional
symmetric spaces having interpretation as classical non-quantum ﬂuctuating classical variables such as
the pointer of a measurement apparatus essential for the standard quantum measurement theory [K15]
. Quantum holography states that partonic 2-surfaces at the light-like boundaries of CDs plus the
corresponding distributions of 4-D tangent spaces of space-time surfaces at carry the information
about quantum state and space-time sheet. The distribution of values of induced K¨ahler form of
CP2 at these surfaces deﬁnes zero modes whereas quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom correspond
to the deformations of space-time surface by the ﬂows induced by Hamiltonians associated with the
degenerate symplectic structure of δM 4
± × CP2.
There exists no well-deﬁned metric integration measure in the inﬁnite-dimensional space of zero
modes, which by deﬁnition do not contribute to the line element of WCW. This does not lead to
diﬃculties if one assumes that a complete localization in zero modes occurs in each quantum jump.
A weaker condition is that wave functions are localized to discrete subsets in the space of zero modes.
An even weaker and perhaps the most realistic condition is that a localization to a ﬁnite-dimensional
2n-dimensional manifold with induced symplectic form deﬁning a positive deﬁnite integration volume
takes place.
The fundamental formulation of quantum TGD in terms of the modiﬁed Dirac action [K13, K25]
containing a measurement interaction term guarantees quantum classical correspondence in the sense
that the geometry of the space-time surface correlates with the values of conserved quantum numbers.

102
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
The resulting correlation of zero modes with the values of quantum numbers can be interpreted as an
abstract form of quantum entanglement reduced in quantum jump for the standard deﬁnition of the
entanglement entropy. This reproduces standard quantum measurement theory.
3.1.4
Quantum classical correspondence
Quantum classical correspondence has served as a guideline in the evolution of the ideas and the
identiﬁcation of the geometric correlates of various quantum notions at the level of imbedding space
and space-time surfaces has been an important driving force in the progress of ideas.
1. In zero energy ontology causal diamonds (CDs) identiﬁed roughly as intersections of future and
past directed light-cones are in key role. At imbedding space level CD is a natural correlate for
self and sub-CDs serve as correlates of sub-selves identiﬁed as mental images. At space-time level
the space-time sheets having their ends at the light-like boundaries of CD serve as correlates
for self. For a system characterized by a primary p-adic length scale Lp ∝2k/2 the size scale of
CD is secondary p-adic scale Lp,2 = √pLp ∝2k. p-Adic length scale hypothesis follows if the
proper time distance between the tips of CDs is quantized in powers of 2. This quantization
should relate directly to almost equivalence of octaves associated with music experience.
2. At the level of space-time the identiﬁcation of join along boundaries bonds between space-time
sheets (more precisely, between partonic 2-surfaces) as a correlate for bound state entanglement
suggests itself. Join along boundaries bonds correspond typically to magnetic ﬂux tubes in the
TGD inspired quantum model of living matter. The size scale of the magnetic body of system
is given by the size scale of CD and much larger than the size of the system itself.
3. The space-time sheets in the intersection of the real and p-adic WCWs characterized by the
property that the mathematical representation of the partonic 2-surfaces at the ends representing
holograpically the state allows interpretation in both real and p-adic sense would correspond
to the correlates for negentropic entanglement. Rational and algebraic 2-surfaces (in preferred
coordinates) would be the common points of realities and p-adicities.
Quantum classical correspondence allows also to generate new views about quantum theory itself.
Many-sheeted space-time and p-adic length scale hierarchy force to generalize the notion of sub-system.
The space-time correlate for the negentropic and bound state entanglement is the formation of join
along boundaries bonds connecting two space-time sheets. The basic realization is that two disjoint
space-time sheets can contain smaller space-time sheets topologically condensed at them and connected
by join along boundaries bonds. Thus systems un-entangled at a given level of p-adic hierarchy -that is
in the measurement resolution deﬁned by the level considered - can contain entanglement subsystems
at lower level not visible in the resolution used.
In TGD inspired theory of consciousness this makes possible sharing and fusion of mental images
by entanglement. The resolution dependence for the notions of sub-system and entanglement means
that the entanglement between sub-systems is not ”seen” in the length scale resolution of unentangled
systems. This phenomenon does not result as an idealization of theoretician but is a genuine physical
phenomenon. Obviously this generalized view about sub-system poses further challenges to the de-
tailed formulation of NMP. Note that the resulting mental image should depend on whether subselves
are entangled by bound state entanglement or negentropic entanglement.
3.1.5
Fusion of real and p-adic physics
The fusion of real and p-adic physics to a larger structure has been a long standing challenge for
TGD. The motivations come both from elementary particle physics and TGD inspired theory of con-
sciousness, in particular from the attempt to model how intentions proposed to have p-adic space-time
sheets as space-time correlates are transformed to actions having real space-time sheets as correlates.
The basic idea is that various number ﬁelds are fused to a larger structure by gluing them along
rationals and common algebraic numbers. The challenge is to imagine what quantum jump and NMP
could mean in this framework. The ﬁrst question is how the unitary process acts.

3.1. Introduction
103
1. U-process acts in spinorial degrees of freedom of WCW (fermionic Fock space for a given 3-
surface) and in WCW degrees of freedom (the space of partonic 2-surfaces roughly). The trans-
formation of intention to action would correspond to a leakage from p-adic to real sector of
WCW.
2. At the level of WCW one can only speak about classical spinor ﬁelds and the idea about tensor
product of states corresponding to diﬀerent sectors of WCW does not look reasonable at the
ﬁrst glance. Rather, a quantum superposition of WCW spinor ﬁelds localized at various sectors
would look more appropriate. Therefore the WCW spinor ﬁeld would be in ﬁxed number ﬁeld
after state function reduction if it involves localization in this sense. This does not look sensible.
The tensor product for fermionic Fock spaces is indeed very natural and strongly suggested also
by the interpretation of the 3-surfaces as particles. One can indeed consider CDs and their
unions and it would seem reasonable to assign to the unions of CDs tensor products of the
corresponding WCW spinor ﬁelds. Let us assume this.
3. Let us assume that the initial zero energy state state represents an un-entangled tensor product
of states in various number ﬁelds. The simplest assumption is that U process can induce a
leakage between diﬀerent sectors only in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. This would
also hold true as far as entanglement between diﬀerent number ﬁelds is considered. This would
allow to realize intentional action geometrically as a p-adic-to-real transition. The p-adic and
real variants of a state quantum entangled with a third (say real) state would deﬁne the entangled
system and state function reduction would select either p-adic or real variant of the state. The
selection would be whether to transform action to its cognitive representation or intention to
action. Also a transformation of a real zero energy state to its cognitive representation in p-adic
sense is possible as also transformations between p-adic cognitive representations characterized
by diﬀerent primes.
4. For partonic 2-surfaces the quantum superposition of quantum states belonging to diﬀerent
number ﬁelds in the intersection would mean a quantum superposition of real and various p-
adic variants of the surface with given mathematical representation forming tensor products
with the states of second system, which could be real for instance. U-matrix could lead to this
kind of quantum superposition. U-matrix between diﬀerent number ﬁelds should be expressible
using only the geometric data from the intersection of the real and p-adic variants of the partonic
surface- that is rational points and common algebraic points, whose number is expected to be
ﬁnite. Some kind of number theoretic quantum ﬁeld theory should describe the U-matrix. State
function reduction would involve the selection of whether the outcome is action or intention
(or cognitive representation). Note that if the real-real entanglement is non-algebraic the NMP
leads to a ﬁnal state with algebraic entanglement between real system and p-adic cognitive
representation of the other system. If real-real entanglement is algebraic, the reduction can lead
from intention to action as a more negentropic ﬁnal state.
5. It has been assumed that entanglement and matrix elements of U between diﬀerent number
ﬁelds are possible only in the intersection of the real and p-adic worlds.
This is natural if
entanglement coeﬃcients between diﬀerent number ﬁelds are represented in terms of the data
provided by the intersection of the real and p-adic variants of partonic 2-surfaces involved and
consisting of rational points and some algebraic points. Outside the intersection real and p-adic
worlds would evolve independently. One could criticize this picture as raising the intersection
of real and p-adic worlds to a singular position. Life is however something very special and the
interpretation in terms of number theoretical criticality justiﬁes this singular character.
3.1.6
Dark matter hierarchy
The identiﬁcation of dark matter as phases having large value of Planck constant [K73, K24, K20]
led to a vigorous evolution of ideas. Entire dark matter hierarchy with levels labelled by increasing
values of Planck constant is predicted, and in principle TGD predicts the values of Planck constant if
physics as a generalized number theory vision is accepted [K24] .
The hierarchy of Planck constants is realized in terms of a generalization of the causal diamond
CD × CP2, where CD is deﬁned as an intersection of the future and past directed light-cones of 4-D

104
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Minkowski space M 4. CD × CP2 is generalized by gluing singular coverings and factor spaces of both
CD and CP2 together like pages of book along common back, which is 2-D sub-manifold which is M 2
for CD and homologically trivial geodesic sphere S2 for CP2 [K24] . The value of the Planck constant
characterizes partially the given page and arbitrary large values of ℏare predicted so that macroscopic
quantum phases are possible since the fundamental quantum scales scale like ℏ. The most general
spectrum comes in rational multiples of standard value of Planck constant which corresponds to the
unit of rationals. For CDs the scaling of Planck constants means scaling of the size of CD. This could
explain why the rational multiples of the fundamental frequency are so special for music experience.
All particles in the vertices of Feynman diagrams have the same value of Planck constant so that
particles at diﬀerent pages cannot have local interactions. Thus one can speak about relative darkness
in the sense that only the interactions mediated by the exchange of particles and by classical ﬁelds
are possible between diﬀerent pages. Dark matter in this sense can be observed, say through the
classical gravitational and electromagnetic interactions. It is in principle possible to photograph dark
matter by the exchange of photons which leak to another page of book, reﬂect, and leak back. This
leakage corresponds to ℏchanging phase transition occurring at quantum criticality and living matter
is expected carry out these phase transitions routinely in bio-control. This picture leads to no obvious
contradictions with what is really known about dark matter and to my opinion the basic diﬃculty
in understanding of dark matter (and living matter) is the blind belief in standard quantum theory.
These observations motivate the tentative identiﬁcation of the macroscopic quantum phases in terms
of dark matter and also of dark energy with gigantic ”gravitational” Planck constant.
It seems safe to conclude that the dark matter hierarchy with levels labelled by the values of
Planck constants explains the macroscopic and macro-temporal quantum coherence naturally. That
this explanation is consistent with the explanation based on spin glass degeneracy is suggested by
the following observations. First, the argument supporting spin glass degeneracy as an explanation
of the macro-temporal quantum coherence does not involve the value of ℏat all.
Secondly, the
failure of the perturbation theory assumed to lead to the increase of Planck constant and formation of
macroscopic quantum phases could be precisely due to the emergence of a large number of new degrees
of freedom due to spin glass degeneracy. Thirdly, the phase transition increasing Planck constant has
concrete topological interpretation in terms of many-sheeted space-time consistent with the spin glass
degeneracy.
At least dark matter could be a key player in quantum biology.
1. Dark matter hierarchy and p-adic length scale hierarchy would provide a quantitative formulation
for the self hierarchy. To a given p-adic length scale one can assign a secondary p-adic time scale
as the temporal distance between the tips of the CD. For electron this time scale is .1 second,
the fundamental bio-rhythm. For a given p-adic length scale dark matter hierarchy gives rise to
additional time scales coming as ℏ/ℏ0 multiples of this time scale.
2. The predicted breaking of second law of thermodynamics chacterizing living matter - if identiﬁed
as something in the intersection of real and p-adic words - would be always below the time scale
of CD considered but would take place in arbitrary long time scales at appropriate levels of the
hierarchy. The scaling up of ℏalso scales up the time scale for the breaking of the second law.
3. The hypothesis that magnetic body is the carrier of dark matter in large ℏphase has led to
models for EEG predicting correctly the band structure and even individual resonance bands
and also generalizing the notion of [J27] [K21] . Also a generalization of the notion of genetic
code emerges resolving the paradoxes related to the standard dogma [K40, K21] . A particularly
fascinating implication is the possibility to identify great leaps in evolution as phase transitions
in which new higher level of dark matter emerges [K21] .
3.1.7
Is it possible to unify the notions of quantum jump and self?
An important step in the process was the realization that the generation of macro-temporal quantum
coherence means eﬀective gluing of quantum jumps of quantum jump sequence of sub-system deﬁning
mental images to single quantum jump. This means that in appropriate degrees of freedom state
function reduction and state preparation cease to occur during macro-temporal quantum coherence.
This makes sense if macro-temporal quantum coherence means generation of negentropic or bound
state entanglement stable under subsequent U-processes.

3.1. Introduction
105
The hierarchy of Planck constants and p-adic length scale hypothesis lead to the view that there
is an entire hierarchy of durations for eﬀective quantum jumps and this forces to ask whether the
quantum jumps sequence decomposes into a hierarchy of eﬀective quantum jumps of increasingly long
duration just like physical systems form a hierarchy starting from the level of elementary particles and
continuing through hadronic, nuclear, atomic and molecular physics up to level where astrophysical
objects take the role of particles.
The usually un-noticed fact that hadrons can be regarded as quantum objects in long length and
time scales whereas quark description treats hadrons as dissipative systems forces to ask whether
state function reductions and preparations associated with the hierarchy of CDs form a hierarchy and
whether the dissipative processes in short scales could occur in quantum parallel manner in longer
scales so that one would have quantum superposition of parallel dissipative Universes? Using quantum
computer language this would mean the possibility of quantum superposition of classical dissipative
quantum computations.
These hierarchies suggest that the notions of self and quantum jump could be identiﬁed. Self
would correspond to single quantum jump at the highest level and at the lowest levels to sequences
of quantum jumps in accordance with the geometric representation in terms of CDs.
3.1.8
Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 and quantum measurement theory
with a ﬁnite measurement resolution
The realization that the von Neumann algebra known as hyper-ﬁnite factor of type II1 is tailor made for
quantum TGD has led to a considerable progress in the understanding of the mathematical structure
of the theory and these algebras provide a justiﬁcation for several ideas introduced earlier on basis of
physical intuition.
Hyper-ﬁnite factor of type II1 has a canonical realization as an inﬁnite-dimensional Cliﬀord algebra
and the obvious guess is that it corresponds to the algebra spanned by the gamma matrices of WCW.
Also the local Cliﬀord algebra of the imbedding space H = M 4 × CP2 in octonionic representation
of gamma matrices of H is important and the entire quantum TGD emerges from the associativity
or co-associativity conditions for the sub-algebras of this algebra which are local algebras localized to
maximal associative or co-associate sub-manifolds of the imbedding space identiﬁable as space-time
surfaces.
The notion of inclusion for hyper-ﬁnite factors provides an elegant description for the notion of
measurement resolution absent from the standard quantum measurement theory.
1. The included sub-factor creates in zero energy ontology states not distinguishable from the
original one and the formally the coset space of factors deﬁning quantum spinor space deﬁnes
the space of physical states modulo ﬁnite measument resolution.
2. The quantum measurement theory for hyperﬁnite factors diﬀers from that for factors of type
I since it is not possible to localize the state into single ray of state space. Rather, the ray is
replaced with the sub-space obtained by the action of the included algebra deﬁning the mea-
surement resolution. The role of complex numbers in standard quantum measurement theory is
taken by the non-commutative included algebra so that a non-commutative quantum theory is
the outcome.
3. This leads also to the notion of quantum group. For instance, the ﬁnite measurement resolution
means that the components of spinor do not commute anymore and it is not possible to reduce
the state to a precise eigenstate of spin. It is however perform a reduction to an eigenstate of
an observable which corresponds to the probability for either spin state.
As already explained, the topology of the many-sheeted space-time encourages the generalization
of the notion of quantum entanglement in such a manner that unentangled systems can possess
entangled sub-systems. One can say that the entanglement between subselves is not visible in the
resolution characterizing selves. This makes possible sharing and fusion of mental images central for
TGD inspired theory of consciousness. These concepts ﬁnd a deeper justiﬁcation from the quantum
measurement theory for hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 for which the ﬁnite measurement resolution is
basic notion.

106
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Also the notions of resolution and monitoring pop up naturally in this framework. p-Adic proba-
bilities relate very naturally to hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 and extend the expressive power of the
ordinary probability theory. p-Adic thermodynamics with conformal cutoﬀis very natural for hyper-
ﬁnite factors of type II1 and explains p-adic length scale hypothesis p ≃2k, k prime characterizing
exponentially smaller p-adic length scale.
3.2
Basic view about NMP
The following represents a brief overall view about the notions of quantum jump, self, and NMP.
3.2.1
The general structure of quantum jump
It has gradually become clear that TGD involves ’holy trinity’ of dynamics.
1. The dynamics deﬁned by the preferred extremals of K¨ahler action identiﬁable as counterparts
of Bohr orbits corresponds to the dynamics of material existence, with matter deﬁned as ’res
extensa’, three-surfaces.
2. The dynamics deﬁned by the action of the unitary ”time development” operator U can be
regarded as informational ”time development” occurring at the level of objective existence. U
brings in mind the time evolution operator U(−t, t), t →∞associated with the scattering
solutions of Schr¨odinger equation. It seems however un-necessary and also impossible to assign
Schr¨odinger equation with U. Furthermore, U acts between zero energy states in zero energy
ontology and is more naturally assigned with intentional action rather than to the description
of particle scattering.
3. The dynamics of quantum jumps governed by U and by NMP corresponds to the dynamics of
subjective existence.
In accordance with this, quantum jump decomposes into informational time development
Ψi →UΨi ,
followed by a sequence of self measurements (generalization of state function reduction)
Ψf0 →Ψf1..... →Ψf
governed by NMP. At given step subsystem the decomposition to two un-entangled systems is such
that maximum reduction of entanglement entropy is achieved. This means that the reduction process
proceeds as a binary tree. If subsystem does not allow a decomposition to a pair of free subsystems
with entropic entanglement the process stops.
Zero energy ontology means that one must distinguish between M-matrix and U-matrix.
M-
matrix characterizes the time like entanglement between positive and negative energy parts of zero
energy state and is measured in particle scattering experiments. M-matrix need not be unitary and
can be identiﬁed as a ”complex” square root of density matrix representable as a product of its real
and positive square root and of unitary S-matrix so that thermodynamics becomes part of quantum
theory with thermodynamical ensemble being replaced with a zero energy state. The unitary U-matrix
describes quantum transitions between zero energy states and is therefore something genuinely new.
It is natural to assign the statistical description of intentional action with U-matrix since quantum
jump occurs between zero energy states.
U process is in zero energy ontology something totally new and can be seen as representing an
act of genuine re-creation of the Universe. The following metaphors might help to understand what
is involved.
1. A good metaphor for the quantum jump is as Djinn leaving the bottle (U) fulﬁlling the wish
realized as a choice between various option that is state function reduction. In the case that
ﬁnal state has negentropic entanglement wish is realized in diﬀerent manner.

3.2. Basic view about NMP
107
2. A second useful metaphor is as generation of inﬁnite number of quantum parallel potentialities in
which entire universe is in a totally entangled holistic state of oneness followed by state function
reduction and self measurement cascade analyzing the state into maximally unentangled sub-
systems. NMP states that the analysis produces maximum amount of conscious information.
For irreducible selves analysis process do not continue and the sequences of quantum jumps
eﬀectively take the role of single quantum jump. A further element is the expansion of con-
sciousness when negentropic entangelment is generated. Therefore this structure characterizes
also conscious experience in macro-temporal time scales. Clearly, quantum measurement theory
has fascinating parallels with Krishnamurti’s philosophy of consciousness which underlines the
competing holistic and reductionistic aspects of consciousness.
3. A third metaphor comes from particle physics. Moment of consciousness can be seen as elemen-
tary particle of consciousness and selves as the atoms, molecules, ...galaxies,... of consciousness.
Fractality hypothesis allows to get general vision about structure of consciousness even in the
time scale of human life.
If quantum jump occurs between two diﬀerent time evolutions of Schr¨odinger equation (understood
here in very metaphoral sense) rather than interfering with single deterministic Schr¨odinger evolution,
the basic problem of quantum measurement theory ﬁnds a resolution. The interpretation of quantum
jump as a moment of consciousness means that volition and conscious experience are outside space-
time and state space and that quantum states and space-time surfaces are ”zombies”.
3.2.2
NMP and the notion of self
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) codes for the dynamics of standard state function reduc-
tion and states that the state function reduction process following U-process gives rise to a maximal
reduction of entanglement entropy at each step. In the generic case this implies decomposition of
the system to unique unentangled systems and the process repeats itself for these systems. The pro-
cess stops when the resulting subsystem cannot be decomposed to a pair of free systems since energy
conservation makes the reduction of entanglement kinematically impossible in the case of bound states.
Intuitively self corresponds to a sequence of quantum jumps which somehow integrates to a larger
unit much like many-particle bound state is formed from more elementary building blocks. It also
seems natural to assume that self stays conscious as long as it can avoid bound state entanglement
with the environment in which case the reduction of entanglement is energetically impossible. One
could say that everything is conscious and consciousness can be only lost when the system forms
bound state entanglement with environment.
There is an important exception to this vision based on ordinary Shannon entropy. There exists
an inﬁnite hierarchy of number theoretical entropies making sense for rational or even algebraic entan-
glement probabilities. In this case the entanglement negentropy can be negative so that NMP favors
the generation of negentropic entanglement, which need not be bound state entanglement in standard
sense. Negentropic entanglement might serve as a correlate for emotions like love and experience of
understanding. The reduction of ordinary entanglement entropy to random ﬁnal state implies second
law at the level of ensemble. For the generation of negentropic entanglement the outcome of the
reduction is not random: the prediction is that second law is not universal truth holding true in all
scales. Since number theoretic entropies are natural in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds, this
suggests that life resides in this intersection. The existence eﬀectively bound states with no binding
energy might have important implications for the understanding the stability of basic bio-polymers
and the key aspects of metabolism [K26] . A natural assumption is that self experiences expansion of
consciousness as it entangles in this manner. Quite generally, an inﬁnite self hierarchy with the entire
Universe at the top is predicted.
If one accepts the hierarchy of Planck constants [K24] , it might be un-necessary to distinguish
between self and quantum jump. The hierarchy of Planck constants interpreted in terms of dark matter
hierarchy predicts a hierarchy of quantum jumps such that the size of space-time region contributing
to the contents of conscious experience scales like ℏ. Also the hierarchy of space-time sheets labeled
by p-adic primes suggests the same. That sequence of sub-selves/sub-quantum jumps are experienced
as separate mental images explains why we can distinguish between digits of phone number. The
irreducible component of self (pure awareness) would correspond to the highest level in the ”personal”
hierarchy of quantum jumps and the sequence of lower level quantum jumps would be responsible

108
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
for the experience of time ﬂow. Entire life cycle would correspond to single quantum jump at the
highest(?) level of the personal self hierarchy and pure awareness would prevail during sleep: this
would make it possible to experience directly that I existed yesterday. Whether these two deﬁnitions
of self are in some sense equivalent will be discussed later.
How the contents of consciousness of self are determined
The hypothesis that the experiences of self associated with the quantum jumps occurred after the last
’wake-up’ sum up to single experience, implies that self can have memories about earlier moments of
consciousness. Therefore self becomes an extended object with respect to subjective time and has a
well deﬁned ’personal history’. If temporal binding of experiences involves kind of averaging, quantum
statistical determinism makes the total experience deﬁned by the heap of the experiences associated
with individual quantum jumps reliable. Subjective memory has natural identiﬁcation as a short term
memory.
A given self S behaves essentially as a separate sub-Universe with respect to NMP. If one postulates
that the conscious experiences of sub-selves Si of an self S integrate with the self experience of S to
single experience, one obtains a ﬁltered hierarchy of conscious experiences with increasingly richer
contents and at the top of the hierarchy is entire universe, God, enjoying eternal self-consciousness
since it cannot get entangled with any larger system.
An attractive hypothesis is that the experience of self is abstraction in the sense that the experiences
of sub-selves Sij of Si are abstracted to average experience ⟨Sij⟩. This implies that the experiences
of sub-sub-...selves of S are eﬀectively unconcious to S. This hierarchy obviously has extremely far-
reaching consequences. Temporal binding implies that experiences of individual selves are reliable and
abstraction brings in the possibility of quantum statistical determinism at the level of ensembles.
The binding of experiencers is also possible. The binding of selves by quantum entanglement how-
ever destroys the component selves (note however the comment about situation in which the p-adic
primes are diﬀerent for real entangling selves). This process could correspond to the formation as
wholes from their parts, say the formation of the mental image representing word from the mental
images representing letters, which are all represented as sub-selves. Associative learning might corre-
spond to the generation of entanglement between selves representing objects of the sensory experience
and conscious association would correspond to the reduction of this entanglement generating asso-
ciated sub-selves. The entanglement of sub-selves of two selves is possible if one accepts the length
scale dependent notion of subsystem and means sharing and fusion of mental images, binding of ex-
periences. Entanglement might make possible communication between selves belonging to diﬀerent
levels of the self hierarchy and to diﬀerent number ﬁelds: this entanglement would be reduced always
in state function reduction step.
Dark matter hierarchy and the notion of self
The vision about dark matter hierarchy as a hierarchy deﬁned by quantized Planck constants leads
to a more reﬁned view about self hierarchy and hierarchy of moments of consciousness [K20, K21] .
The hierarchy of dark matter levels is labeled by the values of Planck constant having quantized
but arbitrarily large values. For the most general option the values of ℏare products and ratios of two
integers. The products of distinct Fermat primes and power of two are number theoretically favored
values for these integers. p-Adic length scale hypothesis favors powers of two. The larger the value of
Planck constant, the longer the subjectively experienced duration and the average geometric duration
T ∝ℏof the quantum jump.
Dark matter hierarchy suggests a modiﬁcation of the notion of self, in fact a reduction of the
notion of self to that of quantum jump alone. Each self involves a hierarchy of dark matter levels,
and one is led to ask whether the highest level in this hierarchy corresponds to single quantum jump
rather than a sequence of quantum jumps. This indeed looks extremely natural and the hypothesis
that self remains un-entangled for a longer duration than single quantum jump un-necessary. It is
perhaps un-necessary to emphasize that the reduction of the notion of self to that of quantum jump
means conceptual economy and somewhat ironically, would also a return to the original hypothesis
but with a quantized Planck constant.
The averaging of conscious experience over quantum jumps would occur only for sub-selves at
lower levels of dark matter hierarchy and these mental images would be ordered, and single moment

3.2. Basic view about NMP
109
of consciousness would be experienced as a history of events. One can ask whether even entire life
cycle could be regarded as a single quantum jump at the highest level so that consciousness would
not be completely lost even during deep sleep. This would allow to understand why we seem to know
directly that this biological body of mine existed yesterday.
The fact that we can remember phone numbers with 5 to 9 digits supports the view that self corre-
sponds at the highest dark matter level to single moment of consciousness. Self would experience the
average over the sequence of moments of consciousness associated with each sub-self but there would
be no averaging over the separate mental images of this kind, be their parallel or serial. These mental
images correspond to sub-selves having shorter wake-up periods than self and would be experienced as
being time ordered. Hence the digits in the phone number are experienced as separate mental images
and ordered with respect to experienced time.
3.2.3
NMP, self measurements, cognition, state preparation, qualia
NMP can be seen as the variational principle governing the dynamics of self measurements giving rise
to state preparation and reduction ﬁnding a uniﬁed description as state function reduction in zero
energy ontology.
1. NMP applies to any unentangled subsystem resulting in this cascade of self measurements and
tells that self measurement is performed for the subsystem (or equivalently, its complement)
which gives rise to maximum entanglement negentropy gain in the self measurement.
2. This self measurement process continues until the system decomposes into unentangled sub-
systems consisting of subsystems for which the entanglement is bound state entanglement or
negentropic entanglement.
NMP dictates the anatomy of a single quantum so that there is actually no need to mention the
notion of self at all in the context of NMP (note however the possibility that the notions of self and
quantum are one and same). Despite this it is useful to brieﬂy introduce the basic concepts related
to the notion of self. Self is a subsystem able to remain unentangled in sequential quantum jumps
and preserving its identity in some sense: presumably the p-adic prime characterizing self (and also
the real space-time sheet associated with self) is what characterizes the self identity. One can deﬁne
irreducible self as a self which does not decompose to further sub-selves in state preparation process. A
second reason for introducing the notion of self is that for a self in a state of macro-temporal quantum
coherence the sequence of quantum jumps eﬀectively fuses to single quantum jump representing single
long lasting moment of consciousness. With this deﬁnition self ceases to exist as it fuses to another self
by bound state entanglement of negentropic entanglement. In the latter case self however experiences
expansion of consciousness rather than losing it.
Some further comments about NMP are in order.
1. Standard quantum measurement theory does not allow a spontaneous reduction of entanglement
between quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom of two subsystems associated with a 3-surface.
Only the entanglement between quantum ﬂuctuating and zero mode degrees of freedom, that is
between quantum system and observer can be reduced. The question is therefore whether one
should restrict NMP to the entanglement between zero modes and quantum ﬂuctuating degrees
of freedom or allow also the reduction of entanglement between quantum ﬂuctuating degrees
of freedom. Self measurements aﬀecting entanglement between quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of
freedom are distinguishable from standard quantum measurements. The working hypothesis is
that state function reduction applies to any kind of entanglement.
2. Self measurement involves the division of unentangled subsystem (possibly self, mental image)
into two unentangled subsystems. Analytical thought creates separations and comparisons so
that this division could be identiﬁed as the basic mechanism of cognition. Also sensory experi-
ence generates separations and distinctions so that NMP should be identiﬁed as the variational
principle governing the dynamics of cognition and perception. State reduction process makes the
world of conscious experience to look completely classical since only bound state entanglement
and negentropic entanglement are stable against self measurement. One can thus say that state
function reduction leads from a maximally entangled multiverse state UΨi to a maximally ana-
lyzed state: from quantum holism to classical reductionism. At the level of standard quantum

110
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
measurement theory this process is equivalent with state preparation process yielding totally
unentangled product state as incoming state of particle physics experiment.
3. The fact that self measurement reduces entanglement entropy allows the system to remain
conscious (unless it generates bound state entanglement) but leads to a generation of thermody-
namical entropy at the level of ensemble. Thermodynamical ensemble of sub-sub-selves means
fuzzy mental images at the level of self. Thermodynamical ensemble of sub-selves could give rise
to statistical determinism and be essential for sensory representations.
4. Irreducible self eﬀectively obeys in quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom a unitary time de-
velopment deﬁned by n:th power of U for a sequence of n quantum jumps, at least in reasonable
approximation. This means fractality of consciousness: one can approximate sequences of quan-
tum jumps with single quantum jump such as one can approximate molecules consisting of
elementary particles with a point like particle. This observation is of crucial importance for un-
derstanding how quantum computing is possible in TGD universe despite that single quantum
jump to an increment of psychological time equal to CP2 time. Also Penrose-Hameroﬀhypoth-
esis generalizes to TGD framework and one can understand the purely phenomenological notion
of quantum de-coherence at fundamental level and also how the quantum spin glass nature of
TGD Universe allows to circumvent the objections against Penrose-Hameroﬀhypothesis.
5. The fact that state preparation is not a deterministic process, forces a statistical modelling of
the state of self using the ensemble formed by the prepared states deﬁned by the sequence of
quantum jumps in turn deﬁning the contribution to the contents of consciousness of self as a
statistical average. The simplest description is in terms of thermodynamics. Thermodynamical
density matrix gives the probabilities for various states of a subsystem in the sequence of quantum
jumps occurred after the last ’wake-up’. What is of paramount importance is that the contents of
consciousness of self can be modelled using statistical thermodynamics. Non-geometric sensory
qualia indeed have a close relationship with conjugate pairs of thermodynamical variables such
as temperature-entropy, pressure-volume, chemical potential-particle number,... The sequence of
quantum jumps also deﬁnes a sequence of quantum jumps in zero modes. Statistical averaging
is not so natural for the values of zero modes characterizing the outcomes of the quantum
measurements, which suggests that they could be experienced as separate ones by self and
would correspond to geometric qualia experienced as being sharp and dynamical.
3.3
Physics as fusion of real and p-adic physics and NMP
In this section the vision about state function reduction and preparation processes as number theoretic
necessities is developed: also the chapter ”Fusion of p-Adic and Real Variants of Quantum TGD to
a More General Theory” contains related topics. The proposal raises NMP to fundamental principle
applying also to the state function reduction step.
3.3.1
Basic deﬁnitions related to density matrix and entanglement entropy
In this sequel the detailed deﬁnitions of density matrix and entropy are discussed. It has become clear
that one must distinguish between three kinds of systems systems.
1. Genuinely real systems for which entanglement probabilities are not rational numbers or ﬁnitely
extended rational numbers. In this case one can regard the probabilities as limiting values of
frequencies for outcomes of measurement deﬁned by a time series. This is also the case when the
entanglement coeﬃcients are rational or algebraic numbers but the number of entangled state
pairs is inﬁnite so that the entanglement probabilities need not be algebraic numbers anymore.
2. A genuinely p-adic system is a p-adic system in which entanglement probabilities are not positive
rational numbers so that one cannot interpret the entanglement probabilities as a limit for
frequencies deﬁned by any ensemble.
3. Finitely extended rational entanglement probabilities allow an interpretation as ordinary prob-
abilities. In this case one can regard the probabilities as belonging to an extension of rationals

3.3. Physics as fusion of real and p-adic physics and NMP
111
or to any p-adic number ﬁeld. What is essential is that the number ﬁeld is now discrete whereas
it is continuous in above mentioned cases.
One must use diﬀerent deﬁnition for the real counterpart of the entanglement entropy in these
two cases.
In the ﬁrst case standard Shannon’s entropy works.
In the second case p-adic
counterpart of the Shannon entropy mapped to a real number by the canonical identiﬁcation is
the only possibility. In the third case the number theoretic entropies Sp based on p-adic norm
can be regarded as extended rational numbers as such. In this case Sp can be negative, and one
can ﬁx the value of p used to deﬁne the entropy by requiring that entropy is maximally negative
and thus identiﬁable as a genuine information measure.
Density matrix
The density matrix of subsystem, call it A, can be deﬁned using the standard formulas of QM: essen-
tially trace over the degrees of freedom associated with the complement of A, call it B, is performed.
B could eﬀectively reduce to a sub-system of the complement. Density matrix is hermitian matrix and
can be diagonalized in the real context. Eigenvalues are real and give the weights for various eigen
states in the superposition. There is important duality present: in the basis of A in which the density
matrix for A is diagonal also the density matrix of B is diagonal.
Density matrix actually determines one-one-correspondence between certain states of the system
A and system B. The state in eigen state basis can be written as
|A, B⟩
=
X
m
cm|m⟩× |M(m)⟩,
(3.3.1)
where the map m →M(m) deﬁnes identiﬁcation of certain states of A with certain states of B.
Quantum measurement of density matrix means that subsystem goes to an eigen state of density
matrix. In the p-adic context the diagonalization of the density matrix requires special assumptions
about the form of the state since the p-adic number ﬁelds are not closed with respect to algebraic
operations.
There is an algebraic extension obtained by requiring that each ’real’ p-adic number
has square root [K49] . The extension is 4-dimensional for p ≥3 and 8-dimensional for p = 2. It
can quite well happen that density matrix can be diagonalized only partially in this extension since
the eigenvalues of the density matrix are in general algebraic numbers determined as a solution of
polynomial eigenvalue equation.
One can however allow the extension of the p-adic number ﬁeld to allow eigenvalues in an algebraic
extension. Unless this is allowed the concepts of density matrix and entropy are not well deﬁned for
a generic subsystem. Physically this would mean that quantum state can have irreducible number
theoretic entanglement besides the entanglement related to the quantum statistics. The vision about
TGD as a generalized number theory encourages the allowance of the algebraic extension. This means
that quantum subsystems can be classiﬁed using as criterion the dimension of the p-adic algebraic
extension needed to deﬁne the eigen states and eigenvalues of the density matrix. In well deﬁned sense
physical systems generate increasingly complicated number ﬁelds as algebraic extensions of the p-adic
numbers.
An interesting possibility is that hermiticity in the p-adic context must be deﬁned so that the
eigenvalues of the density matrix are ordinary p-adic numbers: if this is the case then the algebraic
extension is needed only for the diagonalization of the density matrix but the diagonalized density
matrix itself is ’p-adically real’. This option seems however un-necessarily restrictive and will not be
considered in the sequel.
If entanglement coeﬃcients are algebraic numbers then also entanglement probabilities are alge-
braic numbers in the case that the number of entanglement state pairs is ﬁnite. Even ﬁnite-dimensional
extensions of p-adic number numbers involving transcendentals such as e, e2, ..., ep−1) can be allowed.
If the number of entangled state pairs is inﬁnite, entanglement probabilities need not belong to a ﬁnite
extension of rationals and it seems that entanglement cannot be regarded as bound state entanglement
in this case.
p-Adic entanglement negentropy
In the real context negentropy is deﬁned using the standard formula for Shannon entropy:

112
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
N
=
X
k
pk · log(pk) .
(3.3.2)
In the real context one could equally well replace the e-based logarithm log(x) by a-based logarithm
(a could be any positive real) since this introduces only multiplicative factor (loga(x) = log(x)
log(a)).
p-Adic thermodynamics has turned out to be surprisingly successful for the calculation of ele-
mentary particle masses. p-Adic thermodynamics is however naturally based on p-based logarithm
logp rather than the ordinary e-based logarithm since Boltzmann weights are powers of p rather than
exponents. This would suggest the following deﬁnition
N
=
X
k
pk · logp(pk) .
(3.3.3)
There are however two problems:
1. p-based logarithm exists only for pk = pr, that is power of p. One should somehow modify the
deﬁnition of the logarithm so that it is deﬁned for all p-adic numbers.
2. Since the probabilities pk correspond to eigenvalues of density matrix, they in general belong to
some algebraic extension of p-adic numbers. Thus the modiﬁed logarithm should also exist for
any algebraic extension of p-adic numbers.
The deﬁnition of the modiﬁed p-based logarithm Logp(x) should satisfy following constraints.
1. If argument is power of p then modiﬁed logarithm must be equal to p-based logarithm:
Logp(pn) = logp(pn) .
2. Modiﬁed logarithm must be additive in order to make negentropy additive for systems having
no interactions:
Logp(xy) = Logp(x) + Logp(y) .
These requirements ﬁx the deﬁnition of logarithm uniquely. The modiﬁed logarithm can depend
on the p-adic norm of the argument only. Or in terms of canonical identiﬁcation
I :
X
xnpn →
X
xnp−n ,
mapping p-adics to reals and p-adic norm Np(x) one must have
Logp(x)
=
logp([x]) ,
[x]
=
I−1(Np(x)) ,
=

X
n≥n0
xnpn

= pn0 .
(3.3.4)
This deﬁnition works also for the algebraic extensions, for which p-adic norm is deﬁned as the p-adic
norm for the determinant of the linear map induced by a multiplication with z in algebraic extension:
it is easy to see that the determinant of this map is indeed a power of p always (note that this norm
is multiplicative, which implies the additivity of modiﬁed logarithm and entropy).
For the algebraic extensions of p-adic numbers one must deﬁne how the units ek of algebraic
extension z = x + P
k ykek are mapped to the reals in the canonical identiﬁcation map.
ek are
typically roots of integers in the range −1, ..., p. The rule is following: if ek is not a root of p then it
is mapped to ek interpreted as a real number: for instance, 21/3 is mapped to 21/3 for p ̸= 2 in case

3.3. Physics as fusion of real and p-adic physics and NMP
113
that 21/3 does not exist as p-adic number. If ek is root of p it is mapped to its inverse: for instance,
√p is mapped to
1
√p.
Note that p-adic entanglement entropy can be also expressed as a sum over the derivatives of the
p-adic entanglement probabilities with respect to p:
S
=
X
i
d
dppi .
(3.3.5)
The real counterpart of the p-adic entanglement entropy is obtained by canonical identiﬁcation
x = P xnpn →P xnp−n = xR
Sr
=
SR × log(p) .
(3.3.6)
log(p) factor must be included in order to make possible the comparison of entropies associated with
diﬀerent values of p.
The value of the p-adic entanglement entropy is always non-negative. It vanishes if the p-adic
entanglement entropies have unit p-adic norm. Thus S = 0 p-adic entanglement is possible. This
entanglement need not be stable since a direct sum of eigen spaces of density matrix with ﬁnitely
extended rational entanglement probabilities has negative entanglement entropy.
Unless some p-adic probabilities do not have p-adic norm larger than one, p-adic entanglement
entropy is of order O(p) for genuinely p-adic systems so that negentropy gain is below log(p) irrespec-
tive of the size of the system. This situation is realized in p-adic thermodynamics. There is a nice
connection with p-adic mass calculations: p-adic thermal mass squared expectation value is essen-
tially the p-adic entropy. This connection was noticed already [L9] [K53] and it was suggested that
p-adic primes associated with elementary particles could correspond to entropy maxima as function
of p. This connection suggests that the proper deﬁnition of p-adic entropy is based on the canonical
identiﬁcation.
Remark: Statistics does not give rise to entanglement entropy as one might erratically conclude
by considering the symbolic representation of tensor product suggesting the identiﬁcation of ’left’ and
’right’ members of the tensor product as subsystems A and B: the concrete representation of the states
using oscillator operators associated with Y 3 and its complement shows that there is no statistical
entanglement entropy between the subsystem and its complement: if this were the case the entire
universe should behave like a single conscious being and this would be a catastrophe as far as NMP
is considered.
Systems with ﬁnitely extended rational entanglement
In the case of an ﬁnitely extended rational entanglement one can map the p-adic entropy to its real
counterpart using the identiﬁcation by common rationals instead of the canonical identiﬁcation. This
gives the formula
SR
=
Splog(p) ,
Sp
=
X
n
pkLogp(pk)log(p) ,
Logp(x)
=
logp(|x|p) .
(3.3.7)
where the p-adic entropy which can be regarded as a rational number is re-interpreted as a real
number. Note that the probabilities pk are positive numbers. What is remarkable is that in this
case entanglement entropy can be a negative rational number or a number in a ﬁnite extension of
rational numbers. This observation encourages the deﬁnition of the number theoretic entanglement
negentropy as maximum information in the set of all p-adic number ﬁelds and their extensions:
I
≡
Max{−Sp, p prime} .
(3.3.8)

114
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Since the numbers log(p) are independent transcendentals there exists a unique prime for which the
maximum is achieved.
The original identiﬁcation of negentropic entanglement as bound state entanglement is un-necessary
and the observation that negentropic entanglement is possible withing binding energy might have far
reaching consequences concerning the understanding of metabolism and stability of fundamental bio-
polymers.
The consistency with the standard quantum measurement theory requires that the process corre-
sponds to a measurement of the density matrix so that a projection must occur to an eigen space or
sub-space of eigen space of the density matrix if this maximizes negentropy gain. The density matrix
of the system would become
ρ
→
1
Di
Pi .
(3.3.9)
Here Di and Pi denote the dimension of the eigen space associated with pi and corresponding projection
operator. Assuming that Di has the decomposition
Di =
Y
i∈I
qni
i
to a product of powers of primes, the negentropy of the ﬁnal state can be written as
NR
=
Max{nilog(qi)|i ∈I} .
(3.3.10)
The maximization of the increment of entanglement entropy gives a criterion selecting the ﬁnal eigen
space or its sub-space. Quantum classical correspondence suggests that one can assign similar inherent
negentropy to the space-time sheet consisting of D strictly deterministic regions.
For the negentropic entanglement the state function reduction process is far from being random.
It is quite possible that the reduction takes to unique ﬁnal state for which the common denominator
of entanglement probabilities is power of prime. This is achieved if the reduction occurs to a sub-space
for which the denominator measuring roughly the number of states is reduced to a number having
very large p-adic norm for some prime. This suggests that the quantum behavior of negentropic states
resembles more that of cellular automata than of ordinary quantum states.
The eigen spaces of the density matrix with dimensions D = pN are of special interest.
The
entanglement negentropy for D = pNn0, n0 integer not divisible by p, is NR = Nlog(p).
The
reduction to a sub-space of the eigen space can yield higher negentropy gain than the reduction to
the entire eigen space and powers of prime are favored as dimensions of these sub-spaces.
The entanglement negentropy per single dimension of eigen space is NR/D = Nlog(p)p−N/n0.
For D = pN the entanglement negentropy per dimension of eigen space is NR/D = Nlog(p)/pN =
log(D)/D and maximum as a function of n0. NR/D as a function of D has a maximum NR/D = .3662
for D = 3 rather than D = 2 as one might expect. For D = 2 and D = 4 one has NR/D = .3466
(note that there are 4 DNA nucleotides). For other values of D NR/D is smaller.
For extended rational entanglement the measurement of the density matrix can occur only in
special cases. For instance, when the probabilities pk belong to a ﬁnite extension of rational numbers
and are diﬀerent, the measurement of the density matrix would reduce the negentropy to zero and
NMP does not therefore allow the measurement of density matrix to occur. Degenerate eigen spaces
do not correspond to the maximum entanglement negentropy per dimension. pk = nk/pN, nk not
divisible by p, gives NR = Nlog(p) irrespective of dimension D, and NR/D = Nlog(p)/2 for D = 2
(p1 = m/pN and p2 = (pN −m)/pN, m not divisible by p) is the best one can achieve. Since there is no
upper bound for N nor p even in the case of a 2-state system, the negentropy gain can be arbitrarily
high. One could criticize this result as counter intuitive.
3.3.2
Generalization of the notion of information
TGD inspired theory of consciousness, in particular the formulation of Negentropy Maximization
Principle (NMP) in p-adic context, has forced to rethink the notion of the information concept. In
TGD state preparation process is realized as a sequence of self measurements and state preparation

3.3. Physics as fusion of real and p-adic physics and NMP
115
for next quantum jump is state reduction for the previous quantum jump. In zero energy ontology one
can interpret the state preparation for positive and negative energy parts of the state as reduction and
preparation in the sense of standard physics. Each self measurement means a decomposition of the
sub-system involved to two unentangled parts unless the system is bound state. The decomposition is
ﬁxed highly uniquely from the requirement that the reduction of the entanglement entropy is maximal.
Bound state entanglement is stable against self measurement simply because energy conservation
prevents the decay to a pair of free (uncorrelated) subsystems. The generalized deﬁnition of entan-
glement entropy allows to assign a negative value of entanglement entropy to rational and algebraic
entanglement, so that this kind of entanglement would actually carry information, in fact conscious
information (experience of understanding). This kind of entanglement cannot be reduced in state
function reduction. Macro-temporal quantum coherence could correspond to a generation of either
bound state entanglement or negentropic entanglement, and is indeed crucial for ability to have long
lasting non-entropic mental images. Generation of negentropic entanglement would involve experience
about expansion of consciousness and that of bound states entanglement a loss of consciousness.
The mathematical models for quantum computers typically operate with systems for which en-
tanglement probabilities are identical.
Also rational numbers are involved.
Does this mean that
negentropic entanglement makes possible quantum computation? This does not seem to be the case.
State function reduction with random outcomes is a central element of quantum computation which
suggests that quantum computation must be based on entropic entanglement with large enough value
of ℏto overcome the restrictions caused by the interactions with the external world. The negentropic
entanglement in turn would relate to conscious information processing involving experience of under-
standing represented by negentropic entanglement. Negentropic entanglement would make possible
conscious cellular automaton type information processing much closer to that carried out by ordinary
computers and this information processing might be equally important in living systems.
3.3.3
Number theoretic information measures at the space-time level
Quantum classical correspondence suggests that the notion of entropy should have also space-time
counterpart. Entropy requires ensemble and both the p-adic non-determinism and the non-determinism
of K¨ahler action allow to deﬁne the required ensemble as the ensemble of strictly deterministic regions
of the space-time sheet. One can measure various observables at these space-time regions, and the
frequencies for the outcomes are rational numbers of form pk = n(k)/N, where N is the number of
strictly deterministic regions of the space-time sheet. The number theoretic entropies are well deﬁned
and negative if p divides the integer N. Maximum is expected to result for the largest prime power
factor of N. This would mean the possibility to assign a unique prime to a given real space-time sheet.
The classical non-determinism resembles p-adic non-determinism in the sense that the space-time
sheet obeys eﬀective p-adic topology in some length and time scale range is consistent with this idea
since p-adic fractality suggests that N is power of p.
3.3.4
Number theoretical Quantum Mechanics
The vision about life as something in the intersection of the p-adic and real worlds requires a gener-
alization of quantum theory to describe the U-process properly. One must answer several questions.
What it means mathematically to be in this intersection? What the leakage between diﬀerent sectors
does mean? Is it really possible to formally extend quantum theory so that direct sums of Hilbert
spaces in diﬀerent number ﬁelds make sense? Or should one consider the possibility of using only
complex, algebraic, or rational Hilbert spaces also in p-adic sectors so that p-adicization would take
place only at the level of geometry?
What it means to be in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds?
The ﬁrst question is what one really means when one speaks about a partonic 2-surface in the inter-
section of real and p-adic worlds or in the intersection of two p-adic worlds.
1. Many algebraic numbers can be regarded also as ordinary p-adic numbers: square roots of
roughly one half of integers provide a simple example about this. Should one assume that all
algebraic numbers representable as ordinary p-adic numbers belong to the intersection of the real
and p-adic variants of partonic 2-surface (or to the intersection of two diﬀerent p-adic number

116
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
ﬁelds)? Is there any hope that the listing of the points in the intersection is possible without
a complete knowledge of the number theoretic anatomy of p-adic number ﬁelds in this kind of
situation? And is the set of common algebraic points for real and p-adic variants of the partonic
2-surface X2 quite too large- say a dense sub-set of X2?
This hopeless looking complexity is simpliﬁed considerably if one reduces the considerations to
algebraic extensions of rationals since these induce the algebraic extensions of p-adic numbers.
For instance, if the p-adic number ﬁeld contains some n:th roots of integers in the range (1, p−1)
as ordinary p-adic numbers they are identiﬁed with their real counterparts. In principle one
should be able to characterize the -probably inﬁnite-dimensional- algebraic extension of rationals
which is representable by a given p-adic number ﬁeld as p-adic numbers of unit norm. This does
not look very practical.
2. At the level WCW one must direct the attention to the function spaces used to deﬁne partonic
2-surfaces. That is the spaces of rational functions or even algebraic functions with coeﬃcients
of polynomials in algebraic extensions of rational numbers making sense with arguments in all
number ﬁelds so that algebraic extensions of rationals provide a neat hierarchy deﬁning also the
points of partonic 2-surfaces to be considered. If one considers only the algebraic points of X2
belonging to the extension appearing in the deﬁnition the function space as common to various
number ﬁelds one has good hopes that the number of common points is ﬁnite.
3. Already the ratios of polynomials with rational coeﬃcients lead to algebraic extensions of ratio-
nals via their roots. One can replace the coeﬃcients of polynomials with numbers in algebraic
extensions of rationals. Also algebraic functions involving roots of rational functions can be
considered and force to introduce the algebraic extensions of p-adic numbers. For instance, an
n:th root of a polynomial with rational coeﬃcients is well deﬁned if n:th roots of p-adic integers
in the range (1, p −1) are well well-deﬁned. One clearly obtains an inﬁnite hierarchy of function
spaces. This would give rise to a natural hierarchy in which one introduces n:th roots for a
minimum number of p-adic integers in the range (1, p −1) in the range 1 ≤n ≤N. Note that
also the roots of unity would be introduced in a natural manner.
The situation is made more complex because the partonic 2-surface is in general deﬁned by
the vanishing of six rational functions so that algebraic extensions are needed. An exception
occurs when six preferred imbedding space coordinates are expressible as rational functions of
the remaining two preferred coordinates. In this case the number of common rational points
consists of all rational points associated with the remaining two coordinates. This situation is
clearly non-generic. Usually the number of common points is much smaller (the set of rational
points satisfying xn + yn = zn for n > 2 is a good example).
This however suggests that
these surfaces are of special importance since the naive expectation is that the amplitude for
transformation of intention to action or its reversal is especially large in this case. This might
also explain why these surfaces are easy to understand mathematically.
4. These considerations suggest that the numbers common to reals and p-adics must be deﬁned
as rationals and algebraic numbers appearing explicitly in the algebraic extension or rationals
associated with the function spaces used to deﬁne partonic 2-surfaces. This would make the
deduction of the common points of partonic 2-surface a task possible at least in principle. Alge-
braic extensions of rationals rather than those of p-adic numbers would be in the fundamental
role and induce the extensions of p-adic numbers.
Let us next try to summarize the geometrical picture at the level of WCW and WCW spinor
ﬁelds.
1. WCW decomposes into WCWs associated with CDs and there unions. For the unions one has
Cartesian product of WCWs associated with CDs. At the level of WCW spinor ﬁelds one has
tensor product.
2. The WCW for a given CD decomposes into a union of sectors corresponding to various number
ﬁelds and their algebraic extensions. The sub-WCW corresponding to the intersection consists
of partonic 2-surfaces X2 (plus distribution of 4-D tangent spaces T(X4) at X2 - a complication
which will not be considered in the sequel), whose mathematical representation makes sense in

3.3. Physics as fusion of real and p-adic physics and NMP
117
real number ﬁeld and in some algebraic extensions of p-adic number ﬁelds. The extension of
p-adic number ﬁelds needed for algebraic extension of rationals depends on p and is in general
sub-extension of the extension of rationals. This sub-WCW is a sub-manifold of WCW itself. It
has also a ﬁltering by sub-manifolds of QCW. For instance, partonic 2-surfaces representabable
using ratios of polynomials with degree below ﬁxed number N deﬁnes an inclusion hierarchy
with levels labelled by N.
3. The spaces of WCW spinors associated with these sectors are dictated by the second quanti-
zation of induced spinor ﬁelds with dynamics dictated by the modiﬁed Dirac action in more or
less one-one correspondence. The dimension for the modes of induced spinor ﬁeld (solutions of
the modiﬁed Dirac equation at the space-time surface holographically assigned with X2 plus
the 4-D tangent space-space distribution) in general depends on the partonic 2-surface and the
classical criticality of space-time surface suggests an inclusion hierarchy of super-conformal al-
gebras corresponding to a hierarchy of criticalities. For instance, the partonic 2-surfaces X2
having polynomial representations in referred coordinates could correspond to simplest possible
surfaces nearest to the vacuum extremals and having in a well deﬁne sense smallest (but possibly
inﬁnite) dimension for the space of spinor modes.
4. For each CD one can decompose the Hilbert space to a formal direct sum of orthogonal state
spaces associated with various number ﬁelds
H
=
⊕F HF .
(3.3.11)
Here F serves as a label for number ﬁelds. For the sake of simplicity and to get idea about what
is involved, all complications due to algebraic extensions are neglected in the sequel so that only
rational surfaces are regarded as being common to various sectors of WCW.
5. The states in the direct sum make sense only formally since the formal inner product of these
states would be a sum of numbers in diﬀerent number ﬁelds unless one assigns complex Hilbert
space with each sector or restricts the coeﬃcients to be rational which is of course also possible.
This problem is avoided if the state function reduction process induces inside each CD a choice
of the number ﬁeld. One could say that state function is a number theoretical necessity at least
in this sense.
(a) Should the state function reduction in this sense involve a reduction of entanglement be-
tween distinct CDs is not clear.
One could indeed consider the possibility of a purely
number theoretical reduction not induced by NMP and taking place in the absence of
entanglement with reduction probabilities determined by the probabilities assignable to
various number ﬁelds which should be rational or at most algebraic.
Hard experience
however suggests that one should not make exceptions from principles.
(b) The alternative is to allow the Hilbert spaces in question to have rational or at most
algebraic coeﬃcients in the intersection of real and various p-adic worlds. This means that
the entanglement is algebraic and NMP need not lead to a pure state: the superposition of
pairs of entangled states is however mathematically well deﬁned since inner products give
algebraic numbers. Cognitive entanglement stable under NMP would become possible. The
experience of understanding could be a correlate for it. The pairs in the sum deﬁning the
entangled state deﬁned the instances of a concept as a mapping of real world state to its
symbol structurally analogous to a Boolean rule. The entangled states between diﬀerent
p-adic number ﬁelds would deﬁne maps between symbolic representations.
6. Assume that each HF allows a decomposition to a direct sum of two orthogonal parts correspond-
ing to WCW spinor ﬁelds localized to the intersection of number ﬁelds and to the complements
of the intersection:
H
=
Hnm ⊕Hm ,
Hnm
=
⊕F Hnm,F , Hm = ⊕F Hm,F .
(3.3.12)

118
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Here nm stands for ’no mixing’ (no mixing between diﬀerent number ﬁelds and localization to the
complement of the intersection) and m for ’mixing’ (mixing between diﬀerent number ﬁelds in the
intersection). F labels the number ﬁelds. Orthogonal direct sum might be mathematically rather
singular and un-necessarily strong assumption but the notion of number theoretical criticality
favors it.
The general structure of U-matrix neglecting the complexities due to algebraic extensions
M-matrix is diagonal with respect to the number ﬁeld for obvious reasons. U-matrix can however
induce a leakage between diﬀerent number ﬁelds as well as entanglement between diﬀerent number
ﬁelds when unions of CDs are considered.
The simplest assumption is that this entanglement is
induced by the leakage between diﬀerent number ﬁelds for single CD but not directly. For instance,
the members of entangled pair of real states associated with two CDs leak to various p-adic sectors
and induce in this manner entanglement beween diﬀerent number ﬁelds. One must however notice
that the part of U-matrix acting in the tensor product of Hilbert spaces assignable to separate CDs
must be considered separately: it seems that the entanglement inducing part of U is diagonal with
respect to number ﬁeld except in the intersection.
To simplify the rather complex situation consider ﬁrst the U matrix for a given CD by neglecting
the possibility of algebraic extensions of the p-adic number ﬁelds. Restrict also the consideration to
single CD.
1. The unitarity conditions do not make sense in a completely general sense since one cannot add
numbers belonging to diﬀerent number ﬁelds. The problem can be circumvented if the U-matrix
decomposes into a product of U-matrices, which both are such that unitarity conditions make
sense for them. Here an essential assumption is that unit matrix and projection operators are
number theoretically universal. In this spirit assume that for a given CD U decomposes to a
product of two U-matrices Unm inducing no mixing between diﬀerent number ﬁelds and Um
inducing the mixing in the intersection:
U
=
UnmUm .
(3.3.13)
Here the subscript ’nm’ (no mixing) having nothing to do with the induces of U as a matrix
means that the action is restricted to a dispersion in a sector of WCW characterized by particular
number ﬁeld. The subscript ’m’ (mixing) in turn means that the action corresponds to a leakage
between diﬀerent number ﬁelds possible in the intersection of worlds corresponding to diﬀerent
number ﬁelds and that Um acts non-trivially in this intersection.
2. Assume that Unm decomposes into a formal direct sum of U-matrices associated with various
number ﬁelds F:
Unm
=
⊕F Unm,F .
(3.3.14)
Unm,F acts inside HF in both WCW and spin degrees of freedom, does not mix states belonging
to diﬀerent number ﬁelds, and creates a state which is always mathematically completely well
deﬁned in particular number ﬁeld although the direct sum over number ﬁelds is only formally
deﬁned. Unitarity condition gives a direct sum of projection operators to Hilbert spaces as-
sociated with various number ﬁelds. One can assume that this object is number theoretically
universal.
3. Um acts in the intersection of the real and p-adic worlds identiﬁed in the simplied picture
in terms of surfaces representable using ratios of polynomials with rational coeﬃcients. The
resulting superposition of conﬁguration space spinor ﬁelds in diﬀerent number ﬁelds is as such
not mathematical sensible although the expression of Um is mathematically well-deﬁned. If the
leakage takes place with same probability amplitude irrespective of the quantum state, Um is

3.3. Physics as fusion of real and p-adic physics and NMP
119
a unitary operator, not aﬀecting at all the spinor indices of WCW spinor ﬁelds characterizing
quantum numbers of the state and whose action is analogous to unitary mixing of the identical
copies of the state in various number ﬁelds.
The probability with which the intention is realized as action would not therefore depend at all
on the quantum number ﬁelds, but only on the data at points common to the variants of the
partonic 2-surface in various number ﬁelds. Intention would reduce completely to the algebraic
geometry of partonic 2-surfaces. This assumption allows to write U in the form
U
=
UnmUm ,
(3.3.15)
where Um acts as an identity operator in Hnm.
The general structure of U-matrix when algebraic extensions of rationals are allowed
Consider now the generalization of the previous argument allowing also algebraic extensions.
1. For each algebraic extension of rationals one can express WCW as a union of two parts. The
ﬁrst one corresponds to to 2-surfaces, which belong to the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
The second one corresponds to 2-surfaces in the algebraic extension of genuine p-adic numbers
and having necessarily inﬁnite size in real sense. Thefore the decomposition of U to a product
U = UnmUm makes sense also now.
2. It is natural to assume that Um decomposes to a product of two operators: Um = UHUQ. The
strictly horizontal operator UH connects only same algebraic extensions of rationals assigned
to diﬀerent number ﬁelds. Here one must think that p-adic number ﬁelds represent a large
number of algebraic extensions of rationals without need for an algebraic extension in the p-
adic sense. The second unitary operator UQ describes the leakage between diﬀerent algebraic
extensions of rationals. Number theoretical universality encourages the assumption that this
unitary operator reduces to an operator UQ acting on algebraic extensions of rationals regarded
eﬀectively as quantum states so that it would be same for all number ﬁelds. One can even
consider the possibility that UQ depends on the extensions of rationals only and not at all on
partonic 2-surfaces. One cannot assume that UQ corresponds just to an inclusion to a larger state
space since this would give an inﬁnite number of identical copies of same state and imply a non-
normalizable state. Physically UQ would deﬁne dispersion in the space of algebraic extension
of rationals deﬁning the rational function space giving rise to the sub-WCW. The simplest
possibility is that UQ between diﬀerent algebraic extensions is just the projection operator to
their intersection multiplied by a numerical constant determined number theoretical in terms of
ratios of dimensions of the algebraic extensions so that the diﬀusion between extensions products
unit norm states.
One must take into account the consistency conditions from the web of inclusions for the algebraic
extensions of rationals inducing extensions of p-adic numbers.
1. There is an inﬁnite inverted pyramide-like web of natural inclusions of WCWs associated with
algebraic extensions of ratonal numbers and one can assign a copy of this web to all number ﬁelds
if a given p-adic number ﬁeld is characterized by a web deﬁned by algebraic extensions of rationals
numbers, which it is able to represent without explicit introduction of the algebraic extension,
so that the pyramide is same for all number ﬁelds. For instance, the WCW corresponding to
p-adic numbers proper is included to the WCWs associated with any of its genuine algebraic
extensions and deﬁnes the lower tip of the inverted pyramide. From this tip an arrow emerges
connecting it to every algebraic extension deﬁning a node of this web. Besides these arrows
there are arrows from a given extension to all extensions containing it.
2. These geometric inclusions induce inclusions of the corresponding Hilbert spaces deﬁned by
rational functions and possibly by algebraic functions in which case sub-web must be considered
(all n:th roots of integers in the range (1, p −1) must be introduced simultaneously). Leakage

120
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
can occur between diﬀerent extensions only through WCW spinor ﬁelds located in the common
intersection of these spaces containing always the rational surfaces. The intersections of WCWs
associated with various extensions of p-adic number ﬁelds correspond to WCWs assignable to
rational functions with coeﬀﬁcients in various algebraic extensions of rationals using preferred
coordinates of CD and CP2.
Together with unitarity conditions this web poses strong constraints on the unitary matrices Um
and UQ expressible conveniently in terms of commuting diagrams. There are two kinds of webs. The
vertical webs are deﬁned by the algebraic extensions of rationals. These form a larger web in which
lines connect the nodes of identical webs associated with various p-adic number ﬁelds and represent
algebraic extensions of rationals.
1. One has the general product decomposition U = UnmUQUm, where Unm does not induce mixing
between number ﬁelds, and Um does it purely horizontally but without aﬀecting quantum states
in WCW spin degreees of freedom, and P(Hnm) projects to the complement of the intersection
of number ﬁelds holds true also now.
2. Each algebraic extension of rationals gives unitary conditions for the corresponding Unm,F for
each p-adic number ﬁeld with extensions included. These conditions are relatively simple and
no commuting diagrams are needed.
3. In the horizontal web Um mixes the states in the intersections of two number ﬁelds but connects
only same algebraic extensions so that the lines are strictly horizontal. UQ acts strictly verti-
cally in the web formed by algebraic extension of rationals and its action is unitary. One has
inﬁnite number of commuting diagrams involving Um and UQ since the actions along all routes
connecting given points between p1 and p2 must be identical.
4. If algebraic universality holds in the sense that Um is expressible using only the data about
the common points of 2-surfaces in the intersection deﬁned by particular extensions using some
universal functions, and UQ is purely number theoretical unitary matrix having no dependence
on partonic 2-surfaces, one can hope that the constraints due to commuting diagrams in the web
of horizontal inclusions can be satisﬁed automatically and only the unitarity constraints remain.
This web of inclusions brings strongly in mind the web of inclusions of hyper-ﬁnite factors.

Anatomy of quantum jump in zero energy ontology
Consider now the anatomy of quantum jump identiﬁed as a moment of consciousness in the framework
of ZEO [K44].
1. Quantum jump begins with unitary process U described by unitary matrix assigning to a given
zero energy state a quantum superposition of zero energy states.
This would represent the
creative aspect of quantum jump - generation of superposition of alternatives.
2. The next step is a cascade of state function reductions proceeding from long to short scales. It
starts from some CD and proceeds downwards to sub-CDs to their sub-CDs to ...... At a given
step it induces a measurement of the quantum numbers of either positive or negative energy
part of the quantum state. This step would represent the measurement aspect of quantum jump
- selection among alternatives.
3. The basic variational principle is Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) [K44] stating that
the reduction of entanglement entropy in given quantum jump between two subsystems of CD
assigned to sub-CDs is maximal. Mathematically NMP is very similar to the second law although
states just the opposite but for individual quantum system rather than ensemble. NMP actually
implies second law at the level of ensembles as a trivial consequence of the fact that the outcome
of quantum jump is not deterministic.
For ordinary deﬁnition of entanglement entropy this leads to a pure state resulting in the mea-
surement of the density matrix assignable to the pair of CDs. For hyper-ﬁnite factors of type
II1 (HFFs) state function reduction cannot give rise to a pure state and in this case one can

121
speak about quantum states deﬁned modulo ﬁnite measurement resolution and the notion of
quantum spinor emerges naturally. One can assign a number theoretic entanglement entropy to
entanglement characterized by rational (or even algebraic) entanglement probabilities and this
entropy can be negative. Negentropic entanglement can be stable and even more negentropic
entanglement can be generated in the state function reduction cascade.
The irreversibility is realized as a property of zero energy states (for ordinary positive energy
ontology it is realized at the level of dynamics) and is necessary in order to obtain non-trivial U-
matrix. State function reduction should involve several parts. First of all it should select the density
matrix or rather its Hermitian square root. After this choice it should lead to a state which prepared
either at the upper or lower boundary of CD but not both since this would be in conﬂict with the
counterpart for the determinism of quantum time evolution.
3.4.1
Generalization of S-matrix
ZEO forces the generalization of S-matrix with a triplet formed by U-matrix, M-matrix, and S-
matrix. The basic vision is that quantum theory is at mathematical level a complex square roots of
thermodynamics. What happens in quantum jump was already discussed.
1. U-matrix as has its rows M-matrices , which are matrices between positive and negative energy
parts of the zero energy state and correspond to the ordinary S-matrix. M-matrix is a product
of a hermitian square root - call it H - of density matrix ρ and universal S-matrix S commuting
with H: [S, H] = 0. There is inﬁnite number of diﬀerent Hermitian square roots Hi of density
matrices which are assumed to deﬁne orthogonal matrices with respect to the inner product
deﬁned by the trace: Tr(HiHj) = 0. Also the columns of U-matrix are orthogonal. One can
interpret square roots of the density matrices as a Lie algebra acting as symmetries of the
S-matrix.
2. One can consider generalization of M-matrices so that they would be analogous to the elements
of Kac-Moody algebra. These M-matrices would involve all powers of S.
(a) The orthogonality with respect to the inner product deﬁned by ⟨A|B⟩= Tr(AB) requires
the conditions Tr(H1H2Sn) = 0 for n ̸= 0 and Hi are Hermitian matrices appearing as
square root of density matrix. H1H2 is hermitian if the commutator [H1, H2] vanishes. It
would be natural to assign n:th power of S to the CD for which the scale is n times the
CP2 scale.
(b) Trace - possibly quantum trace for hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1) is the analog of integra-
tion and the formula would be a non-commutative analog of the identity
R
S1 exp(inφ)dφ = 0
and pose an additional condition to the algebra of M-matrices. Since H = H1H2 commutes
with S-matrix the trace can be expressed as sum P
i,j hisj(i) = P
i,j hi(j)sj of products of
correspondence eigenvalues and the simplest condition is that one has either P
j sj(i) = 0
for each i or P
i hi(j) = 0 for each j.
(c) It might be that one must restrict M-matrices to a Cartan algebra for a given U-matrix and
also this choice would be a process analogous to state function reduction. Since density
matrix becomes an observable in TGD Universe, this choice could be seen as a direct
counterpart for the choice of a maximal number of commuting observables which would
be now hermitian square roots of density matrices. Therefore ZEO gives good hopes of
reducing basic quantum measurement theory to inﬁnite-dimensional Lie-algebra.
3.4.2
A concise description of quantum jump
In the following a minimalistic view about quantum jump is described. Both U-process and state
preparation reduce to state function reductions to two basis for zero energy states characterized by
opposite arrows of geometric time.

122
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Unitary process and choice of the density matrix
The basic question concerning U process is which of the following two options U-process corresponds
to.
1. U-process occurs for zero energy states. U-matrix would be deﬁned in the space of zero energy
states and would represent kind of higher order scattering whereas M-matrix and S-matrix as
time-like entanglement coeﬃcients would describe what happens in a scattering experiment.
This kind of possibility can be certainly considered since one can form zero energy states using
zero energy states as building bricks. Entire hierarchy of zero energy states could be constructed
in this manner.
2. U-process can be said to occur for either positive or negative energy parts of zero energy states.
This option is deﬁnitely minimal and in this case U-process for positive (negative) energy part
of the state is dual to state function reduction for the negative (positive) energy part of the
state. Furthermore, state function reduction is dual to state preparation. For this reason this
option deserves to be called minimalistic.
During years I have considered both options without clearly distinguishing between them. The
notion of time is very diﬃcult concept: we do not have brain for time. Below I will consider only the
minimalistic option in the hope that Nature would prefer minimalism also at this time. There is no
need to emphasize how speculative these considerations are.
Consider ﬁrst unitary process followed by the choice of the density matrix for the minimalistic
option.
1. There are two natural state basis for zero energy states. The states of these state basis are
prepared at the upper or lower boundary of CD respectively and correspond to various M-
matrices M +
K and M −
L . U-process is simply a change of state basis meaning a representation
of the zero energy state M ±
K in zero energy basis M ∓
K followed by a state preparation to zero
energy state M ±
K with the state at second end ﬁxed in turn followed by a reduction to M ∓
L to
its time reverse, which is of same type as the initial zero energy state.
The state function reduction to a given M-matrix M ±
K produces a state for the state is super-
position of states which are prepared at either lower or upper boundary of CD. It does not yet
produce a prepared state on the ordinary sense since it only selects the density matrix.
2. The matrix elements of U-matrix are obtained by acting with the representation of identity
matrix in the space of zero energy states as
I =
X
K
|K+⟩⟨K+|
on the zero energy state |K−⟩(the action on |K+⟩is trivial!) and gives
U +
KL = Tr(M +
KM +
L ) .
In the similar manner one has
U −
KL = (U +†)KL = Tr(M −
L M −
K) = U +
LK .
These matrices are Hermitian conjugates of each other as matrices between states labelled by
positive or negative energy states. The interpretation is that two unitary processes are possible
and are time reversals of each other. The unitary process produces a new state only if its time
arrow is diﬀerent from that for the initial state. The probabilities for transitions |K+⟩→|K−⟩
are given by pmn = |Tr(M +
KM +
L )|2.

3.4. Anatomy of quantum jump in zero energy ontology
123
State function preparation
Consider next the counterparts of the ordinary state preparation process.
1. The ordinary state function process can act either at the upper or lower boundary of CD and
its action is thus on positive or negative energy part of the zero energy state. At the lower
boundary of CD this process selects one particular prepared states. At the upper boundary it
selects one particular ﬁnal state of the scattering process.
2. Restrict for deﬁniteness the consideration to the lower boundary of CD. Denote also MK by
M. At the lower boundary of CD the selection of prepared state - that is preparation process-
means the reduction
X
m+n−
M ±
m+n−|m+⟩|n−⟩→
X
n−
M ±
m+n−|m+⟩|n−⟩.
The reduction probability is given by
pm =
X
n−
|Mm+n−|2 = ρm+m+ .
For this state the lower boundary carries a prepared state with the quantum numbers of state
|m+⟩.
For density matrix which is unit matrix (this option giving pure state might not be
possible) one has pm = 1.
State function reduction process
The process which is the analog of measuring the ﬁnal state of the scattering process is also needed
and would mean state function reduction at the upper end of CD - to state |n−⟩now.
1. It is impossible to reduce to arbitrary state |m+⟩|n−⟩and the reduction must at the upper end
of CD must mean a loss of preparation at the lower end of CD so that one would have kind of
time ﬂip-ﬂop!
2. The reduction probability for the process
|m+ ≡
X
n−
Mm+n−|m+⟩|n−⟩→n−=
X
m+
Mm+n−|m+⟩|n−⟩
would be
pmn = |M 2
mn| .
This is just what one would expect. The ﬁnal outcome would be therefore a state of type |n−⟩
and - this is very important- of the same type as the state from which the process began so that
the next process is also of type U + and one can say that a deﬁnite arrow of time prevails.
3. Both the preparation and reduction process involves also a cascade of state function reduc-
tions leading to a choice of state basis corresponding to eigenstates of density matrices between
subsystems.
3.4.3
Questions and answers
Answering to question is the best possible manner to develop ideas in more comprehensible form. In
this respect the questions of Hamed at my blog have been especially useful. Many questions below
are made by him and inspired the objections, many of them discussed also in previous discussions.
Question: The minimalistic option suggests very strongly that our sensory perception can be
identiﬁed as quantum measurement assignable to state function reductions for upper or lower bound-
aries of our personal CD. Our sensory perception does not however jump between future and past
boundaries of our personal CD (containing sub-CDS in turn containing)! Why?

124
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Possible answer: If our sensory perception is about CD which is much bigger than personal
CD the problem disappears. We perceive from day to day the -say- positive energy part of a state
assignable to this very big CD. The world looks rather stable. Question: Could our sensory perception
actually do this jumping so that sensory inputs are alternatively about upper and lower boundaries
of personal CD? Could sleep-awake cycle correspond to this ﬂip ﬂop?
Possible answer: The geometric time span for quantum jumps in question would correspond
to the geometric time scale for our personal CD. In wake-up state we are performing state function
reduction at the upper boundary of our personal CD and sensory mental images as sub-CDs are
concentrated there. When we are asleep, same happens at lower boundary of CD and sensory mental
images are there (dreams,).
Question: What is the time scale assignable to my personal CD: the typical wake-up cycle: 24
hours? Or of the order of life span. Or perhaps shorter? Why we do not remember practically anything
about sensory perceptions during sleep period? (Note that we forget actively dream experiences).
Does the return to childhood at old age relate with this time ﬂip-ﬂop in the scale of life span: do we
re-incarnate in biologically death at opposite end of CD with scale of life span?
Possible answer: These are interesting possibilities. The explanation would be that for some
reason we do not have many memories about dream time existence? We certainly forget very rapidly
dream experiences. Is this process active and is it purpose to avoid the mixing of two realities? Or is
it due to the fact that the required communications to geometric past are over so long time interval
that the attempts to remember fail? Could dream memories represent memories about the period
in which our sensory percepts correspond to past boundary of CD? If this boundary corresponds to
time scale of life cycle, the memories would be about childhood. Dreams are often located to the past
and childhood.
Question: How the arrow of geometric time at space-time level emerges from the arrow of geo-
metric time for zero energy states? Why do we experience that we move along space-time sheets to
geometric future or equivalently: space-time sheets move with respect to us to geometric past?
Possible answer: The proposal (one of the many, see [K3]), which can be easily ridiculed, is
that the state function reductions performed by sub-selves assignable to sub-CDs at the boundary
of personal CD and representing mental images induce small time translations of space-time sheet
tending to shift it as a whole to past: this induces the arrow of geometric time. Space-time sheet
is like ﬁlm which the curious audience in the movie theatre shifts to a preferred direction. I have
described this movie theatre metaphor in more detail in [K3].
The sub-selves representing sensory mental images are tiny conscious entities and would be very
curious! News are in the geometric future assignable to the space-time sheet and they want to know
what is there and they use their volitional resources to induce a small shift to geometric past.
Why selves would be ”curious”? Could this be understood in terms of Negentropy Maximization
Principle (NMP) [K44] stating that the information gain in quantum jump is maximal or by postulat-
ing a generalization of NMP Selves would be hungry information eaters. As a matter fact, according
to TGD inspired quantum biology our endless hunting of metabolic energy would not be about getting
energy but negentropy associated with the entanglement [K35].
Question: Can the arrow of time change?
Possible answer: A highly interesting question is what happens if the ﬁrst state preparation
leading to a state |k+⟩is followed by a U-process of type U −rather than by the state function
reduction process |k+⟩→|l−⟩. Does this mean that the arrow of geometric time changes? Could this
change of the arrow of geometric time take place in living matter? Could processes like molecular
self assembly be entropy producing processes but with non-standard arrow of geometric time? Or
are they processes in which negentropy increases by the fusion of negentropic parts to larger ones?
Could the variability relate to sleep-awake cycle and to the fact that during dreams we are often in
our childhood and youth. Old people are often said to return to their childhood. Could this have
more than a metaphoric meaning? Could biological death mean return to childhood at the level of
conscious experience? I have explained the recent views about the arrow of time in [K3].
One can consider also other views for the generation of arrow of time. Instead of the time coordinate
for space-time surface one can also consider time coordinate for imbedding space or rather CD. For

3.4. Anatomy of quantum jump in zero energy ontology
125
instance, one can ask how the arrow of cosmic time identiﬁable as lightcone proper time assignable to
CD could be generated. sub-CDs have localization inside bigger CD containing them and one can
quite well imagine that sub-CDs within CD drift towards geometric future of CD quantum jump
by quantum jump and this gives rise to the experience of the time ﬂow based on clock deﬁned by
changing environment. This drifting could occur towards or away from boundaries of CD and would
be in opposite directions at the two boundaries. Various possibilities are discussed in [K3].
One can also imagine that the experience about ﬂow of geometric time corresponds to a state
function reduction cascae at upper boundaries of sub-CDs proceeding from the lower boundary to
upper boundary of CD containing them. The preferred direction for the cascae would be dictated by
the arrow of time assignable to the zero energy states associated with CD.
To sum up, there are several candidates for the mechanism behind the arrow of geometric time
and it would be too early to select any mechanism as the mechanism.
3.4.4
More about the anatomy of state function reduction
In a comment to previous posting Ulla gave a link to an interesting article by George Svetlichny [J126]
describing an attempt to understand free will in terms of quantum measurement. After reading of the
article I found myself explaining once again to myself what state function reduction in TGD framework
really means.
The proposal of Svetlichny
The basic objection against assigning free will to state function reduction in the sense of wave me-
chanics is that state function reduction from the point of view of outsider is like playing dice. One
can of course argue that for an outsider any form of free will looks like throwing a dice since causally
eﬀective experience of free will is accompanied by non-determinism. We simply do cannot know what
is the experience possibly associated with the state function reduction. The lesson is that we must
carefully distinguish between two levels: the single particle level and ensemble level - subjective and
objective. When we can say that something is random, we are talking about ensembles, not about
single member of ensemble.
The author takes the objection seriously and notices that quantum measurement means a division
of system to three parts: measured system, measuring system and external world and argues that in
some cases this division might not be unique. The choice of this division would have interpretation
as an act of free will. I leave it to the reader can decide whether this proposal is plausible or not.
TGD view about state function reduction
What can one say about the situation in TGD framework? There are several diﬀerences as compared
to the standard measurement ”theory”, which is just certain ad hoc rules combined with Born rule,
which applies naturally also in TGD framework and which I do not regard as adhoc in inﬁnite-D
context.
In the sequel I will discuss the possible anatomy of the state function reduction part of the quantum
jump.
1. TGD ontology diﬀers from the standard one. Space-time surfaces and quantum states as such
are zombies in TGD Universe: consciousness is in the quantum jump. Conscious experience is in
the change of the state of the brain, brain state as such is not conscious. Self means integration
of quantum jumps to higher level quantum jumps and the hierarchy of quantum jumps and
hierarchy of selves can be identiﬁed in ZEO . It has the hierarchy of CDs and space-time sheets
as geometrical correlates. In TGD Universe brain and body are not conscious: rather, conscious
experience is about brain and body and this leads to the illusion caused by the assimilation with
the target of sensory input: I am what I perceive.
2. In TGD framework one does not assume the division of the system to a product of measured
system, measuring system, and external world before the measurement. Rather, this kind of
divisions are outcomes of state function reduction which is part of quantum jump involving also
the unitary process. Note that standard measurement theory is not able to say anything about
the dynamics giving rise to this kind of divisions.

126
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
3. State function reduction cascade as a part of quantum jump - this holistic view is one new element
- proceeds in zero energy ontology (ZEO) from long to short length scales CD →sub −CDs →
..., and stops when Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP [K44] deﬁning the variational
principle of consciousness is also something new) does not allow to reduce entanglement entropy
for any subsystem pair of subsystem un-entangled with the external world. This is the case if
the sub-system in question is such that all divisions to two parts are negentropically entangled
or form an entangled bound state.
An interesting possibility is that negentropic entanglement does not correspond to bound state
entanglement. The negentropically entangled particles would remain correlated by NMP rather
than being in the jail deﬁned by the interaction potential. I have proposed that this analog
of love marriage could be fundamental for understanding living matter and that high energy
phosphate bond central for ADP-ATP process could involve negentropic entanglement [K35].
For a given subsystem occurring in the cascade the splitting into an unentangled pair of measured
and measuring system can take place if the entanglement between these subsystems is entropic.
The splitting takes place for a pair with largest entanglement entropy and deﬁnes measuring
and measured system.
Who measures whom?
This seems to be a matter of taste and one should not talk about
measuring system as conscious entity in TGD Universe, where consciousness is in quantum
jump.
4. The factorization of integer to primes is a rather precise number theoretical analogy for what
happens, and the analogy might actually have a deeper mathematical meaning since Hilbert
spaces with prime dimension cannot be decomposed into tensor products. Any factorization of
integer to a product of primes corresponds to a cascade of state function reductions. At the
ﬁrst step division takes place to two integers and several alternative divisions are possible. The
pair for which the reduction of entanglement entropy is largest, is preferred. The resulting two
integers can be further factorized to two integers, and the process continues and eventually stops
when all factors are primes and no further factorization is possible.
One could even assign to any decomposition n = rs the analogs of entanglement probabilities
as p1 = log(r)/log(n) and p2 = log(s)/log(n). NMP would favor the divisions to factors r and
s which are as near as possible to n/2.
Negentropically entangled system is like prime. Note however that these systems can still make
an analog of state function reduction which does not split them but increases the negentropy
for all splittings of system to two parts.
This would be possible only in the intersection of
real and p-adic worlds, that is for living matter. My cautious proposal is that just this kind of
systems - living systems - can experience free will: either in the analog of state function reduction
process increasing their negentropy or in state function process reducing their entanglement with
environment.
5. In standard measurement theory observer chooses the measured observables and the theory says
nothing about this process. In TGD the measured observable is the density matrix for a pair
formed by any two entangled parts of sub-system division for which negentropy gain is maximal
in quantum measurement deﬁnes the pair. Therefore both the measurement axis and the pair
representing the target of measurement and measurer are selected in quantum jump.
6. Quantum measurement theory assumes that measurement correlates classical long range degrees
of freedom with quantal degrees of freedom. One could say that the direction of the pointer
of the measurement apparatus correlates faithfully with the value of the measured microscopic
observable. This requires that the entanglement is reduced between microscopic and macroscopic
systems .
I have identiﬁed the ”classical” degrees of freedom in TGD framework as zero modes which by
deﬁnition do not contribute to the line-element of WCW although the WCW metric depends
on zero modes as external parameters. The induced K¨ahler ﬁeld represents an inﬁnite number
of zero modes whereas the Hamiltonians of the boundaries of CD deﬁne quantum ﬂuctuating
degrees of freedom.

3.4. Anatomy of quantum jump in zero energy ontology
127
The reduction of the entanglement between zero modes and quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of
freedom is an essential part of quantum measurement process. Also state function reductions
between microscopic degrees of freedom are predicted to occur and this kind of reductions lead
to decoherence so that one can apply quantum statistical description and derive Boltzmann
equations. Also state function reductions between diﬀerent values of zero modes are possible are
possible and one could perhaps assign ”telepathic” eﬀects with them.
The diﬀerences with respect to the standard quantum measurement theory are that several
kinds of state function reductions are possible and that the division to classical and quantum
ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom has a purely geometric meaning in TGD framework.
7. One can even imagine quantum parallel state function reduction cascades. This would make
possible quantum parallel dissipation, which would be something new. My original proposal was
that in hadronic physics this could make possible a state function reduction cascade proceeding
in quark scales while hadronic scales would remain entangled so that one could apply statistical
description to quarks as parts of a system, which is quantum coherent in hadronic length scale.
This looks nice but...!
It is a pity that eventually an objection pops up against every idea
irrespective how cute it looks like. The p-adic primes associated with light quarks are larger
than that associated with hadron so that quarks - or rather, their magnetic bodies are larger than
that hadron’s magnetic body. This looks strange at ﬁrst but actually conforms with Uncertainty
Principle and the observation that the charge radius of proton is slightly smaller than predicted
(see this, [K46]), gives support for this picture. Geometrically the situation might change if
quarks are highly relativistic and color magnetic ﬁelds of quarks are dipoled ﬁelds compressed
to cigar like shape: Lorentz contraction could reduce the size scale of their magnetic bodies in
the direction of their motion. [Note that p-adic length scale hypothesis applies in the rest system
of the particle so that Lorentz contraction is in conﬂict with it]. Situation remains unsettled.
Further questions
There are many other interesting issues about which my understanding could be much better.
1. In ZEO the choice of the quantization axes and would ﬁx the moduli of the causal diamond CD:
the preferred time direction deﬁned by the line connecting the tips of CD, the spin quantization
axis, etc.. This choice certainly occurs. Does it reduce to the measurement of a density matrix
for some decomposition of some subsystem to a pair? Or should one simply assume state function
reductions also at this level meaning localization to a sector of WCW corresponding to given
CD. This would involve localization in the moduli space of CDs selecting some boost of a
CD with ﬁxed quantized proper time distance between it tips, ﬁxed spin directions for positive
and negative energy parts of zero energy states deﬁned by light-like geodesics at its light-like
boundary. Preferred complex coordinates for CP2, etc...
2. Zero energy states are characterized by arrow of geometric time in the sense that either positive
or negative energy parts of states have well deﬁned particles numbers and single particle numbers
but not both. State function reduction is possible only for positive or negative energy part of
the state but not both. This should relate very closely to the fact that our sensory percepts
deﬁned by state function reductions are mostly about the upper or lower boundary of CD, or to
the fact that we do not remember the percepts made from the other boundary during sleeping
period.
3. In ZEO also quantum jumps can also lead to generation of new sub-Universes, sub-CDs carrying
zero energy states. Quantum jumps can also involve phase transitions changing p-adic space-
time sheets to real ones and these could serve as quantum correlates for intentional actions.
Also the reverse process changing matter to thoughts is possible. These possibilities are totally
unimaginable in the quantum measurement theory for systems describable by wave mechanics.
4. There is also the notion of ﬁnite measurement resolution described in terms of inclusions of
hyperﬁnite factors at quantum level and in terms of braids at space-time level.
To summarize, a lot of theory building is needed in order to fuse all new elements to a coherent
framework.
In this framework standard quantum measurement theory is only a collection of ad

128
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
hoc rules and can catch only a small part of what really happens.
Certainly, standard quantum
measurement theory is is far from being enough for the purposes of consciousness theorist.
3.5
Generalization of NMP to the case of hyper-ﬁnite type
II1 factors
The intuitive notions about entanglement do not generalize trivially to the context of relativistic
quantum ﬁeld theories as the rigorous algebraic approach of [C1] based on von Neumann algebras
demonstrates.
von Neumann algebras can be written as direct integrals of basic building blocks
referred to as factors [A3] . Factors can be classiﬁed to three basic types labelled as type I, II, and III.
Factors of type I appear in non-relativistic quantum theory whereas factors of type III1 in relativistic
QFT [C1] . Factors of type II1 [A10] , believed by von Neumann to be fundamental, appear naturally
in TGD framework [K92] .
3.5.1
Factors of type I
The von Neuman factors of type I correspond to the algebras of bounded operators in ﬁnite or
inﬁnite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces. In the ﬁnite-dimensional case the algebra reduces to
the ordinary matrix algebra in the ﬁnite-dimensional case and to the algebra of bounded operators
of a separable Hilbert space in the inﬁnite-dimensional case. Trace is the ordinary matrix trace. The
algebra of projection operators has one-dimensional projectors as basic building blocks (atoms), the
notion of pure state is well-deﬁned, and the decomposition of entangled state to a superposition of
products of pure states is unique. This case corresponds to the ordinary non-relativistic quantum
theory. Ordinary quantum measurement theory and also the theory of quantum computation has
been formulated in terms of type I factors. Also the discussion of NMP has been formulated solely in
terms of factors of type I.
3.5.2
Factors of type II1
The so called hyper-ﬁnite type II1 factors, which are especially natural in TGD framework, can be
identiﬁed in terms of the Cliﬀord algebra of an inﬁnite-dimensional separable Hilbert space such that
the unit operator has unit trace. Essentially the fermionic oscillator operator algebra associated with
a separable state basis is in question. The theory of hyper-ﬁnite type II1 factors is rich and has
direct connections with conformal ﬁeld theories [A11] , quantum groups [A12] , knot and 3-manifold
invariants [A18, A29, A2] , and topological quantum computation [K90] , [B13] .
The origin of hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 in TGD
Inﬁnite-dimensional Cliﬀord algebra corresponds in TGD framework to the super-algebra generated by
complexiﬁed conﬁguration space gamma matrices creating conﬁguration space spinors from vacuum
spinor which is the counterpart of Fock vacuum [K92] . By super-conformal symmetry also conﬁgura-
tion space degrees of freedom correspond to a similar factor. For type hyper-ﬁnite II1 factors the trace
is by deﬁnition ﬁnite and normalized such that the unit operator has unit trace. As a consequence,
the traces of projection operators have interpretation as probabilities.
Finite-dimensional projectors have vanishing traces so that the notion of pure state must be gen-
eralized.
The natural generalization is obvious.
Generalized pure states correspond to states for
which density matrix reduces to a projector with a ﬁnite norm. The physical interpretation is that
physical measurements are never able to resolve completely the inﬁnite state degeneracy identiﬁable
in TGD framework as spin glass degeneracy basically caused by the vacuum degeneracy implying
non-determinism of K¨ahler action. An equivalent interpretation is in terms of state space resolution,
which can never be complete.
In TGD framework the relevant algebra can also involve ﬁnite-dimensional type I factors as tensor
factors. For instance, the entanglement between diﬀerent space-time sheets could be of this kind and
thus completely reducible whereas the entanglement in conﬁguration space spin and ”vibrational”
degrees of freedom (essentially fermionic Fock space) would be of type II1. The ﬁnite state-space

resolution seems to eﬀectively replace hyper-ﬁnite type II1 factors with ﬁnite-dimensional factors of
type I.
The new view about quantum measurement theory
This mathematical framework leads to a new kind of quantum measurement theory. The basic as-
sumption is that only a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom can be quantum measured in a given
measurement and the rest remain untouched. What is known as Jones inclusions N ⊂M of von
Neumann algebras allow to realize mathematically this idea [K92] . N characterizes measurement res-
olution and quantum measurement reduces the entanglement in the non-commutative quantum space
M/N. The outcome of the quantum measurement would still represented by a unitary S-matrix but
in the space characterized by N. It is not possible to end up with a pure state with a ﬁnite sequence
of quantum measurements.
The measurement of components of quantum spinors does not make sense since it due to the non-
commutativity it is not possible to talk about quantum spinor with single non-vanishing component.
Therefore the measurements must be thought of as occurring in the state space associated with
quantum spinors. The possible consequences of non-commutativity are considered from the point of
view of cognition in [K92] by starting from the observation that the moduli squared of quantum spinor
components are commuting hermitian operators possessing a universal rational valued spectrum which
suggests interpretation in terms of quantum version of fuzzy belief.
The obvious objection is that the replacement of a universal S-matrix coding entire physics with a
state dependent unitary entanglement matrix is too heavy a price to be paid for the resolution of the
above mentioned paradoxes. Situation could be saved if the S-matrices have fractal structure. The
quantum criticality of TGD Universe indeed implies fractality. The possibility of an inﬁnite sequence
of Jones inclusions for hyperﬁnite type II1 factors isomorphic as von Neumann algebras expresses
this fractal character algebraically. Thus one can hope that the S-matrix appearing as entanglement
coeﬃcients is more or less universal in the same manner as Mandelbrot fractal looks more or less the
same in all length scales and for all resolutions. Whether this kind of universality must be posed as
an additional condition on entanglement coeﬃcients or is an automatic consequence of unitarity in
type II1 sense is an open question.
What happens in repeated measurements?
The assumption of the standard quantum measurement theory is that the outcome of state function
reduction does not change in further measurements if the combined system consisting of measured
system and performer of measurement is isolated. This hypothesis generalizes to the case of hyper-
ﬁnite type II1 factors. Suppose that the outcome of a quantum jump represented by a projection
operator P. If the combined system is not isolated, P can replaced by an arbitrary projection operator
in the next unitary process. If the combined system is isolated, the next unitary process leads to a
state in which P is replaced by a state expressible in terms of projection operators Pi projecting to
the sub-space deﬁned by P, and one of them is selected in the next state function reduction or state
preparation. A never-ending series of quantum jumps forcing the state to a smaller and smaller but
always inﬁnite-dimensional corner of the state-space would result in absence of the unitary process
regenerating the entanglement. This process could be seen as a counterpart for the process in which
state function reduction and state preparation processes propagate from long to short length scales.
The notion of rational entanglement has a natural type II1 counterpart and corresponds to rational
valued traces for the projection operators involved and rational valued coeﬃcients for these projection
operators in the expression of the density matrix. The idea about rational entanglement (or algebraic
entanglement in algebraic extension of p-adics in question) as bound state entanglement carrying
negative entanglement entropy generalizes.
Rational density matrices are in a special role since they can be thought of as being common to
the real and p-adic variants of the state space. The information measures based on p-adic norm and
allowing negative entanglement entropy make sense also now. The question whether there might be
some deeper justiﬁcation for the stability of the generalized rational (algebraic) entanglement against
state function reduction/preparation reducing entanglement negentropy in the context of hyper-ﬁnite
type II1 factors, remains to be answered.

130
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Consider a rationally entangled state characterized by projection operators Pi such that the prob-
abilities pi are rational and remain stable in the unitary process. For factor of type I, a situation
in which Pi are replaced by 1-dimensional projectors Qi < Pi is achieved sooner or later. In the
inﬁnite-dimensional case this situation can be approached but never reached.
p-Adic thermodynamics with conformal cutoﬀand hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1
For hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 the unit matrix has unit trace. Hence real probabilities assignable to
ﬁnite-dimensional projectors vanish so that the eigenvalues of the density matrix are always inﬁnitely
degenerate in the real context. p-Adic probabilities however make sense as ﬁnite p-adic numbers even
if they vanish as real numbers. This raises the idea that p-adic probabilities are more natural for hyper-
ﬁnite factors of type II1 than real ones. Indeed, in p-adic context one could have ﬁnite probabilities for
even one-dimensional sub-spaces, which would deﬁnitely mean an enhanced expressive power of the
formalism. Thus hyper-ﬁnite factors of II1 would give the reason why for p-adic thermodynamics [K48]
.
The interpretation of p-adic probabilities is of overall importance from the point of view of physics.
When probabilities are rational, the number ﬁeld does not matter. If not, it seems necessary to map
the p-adic probabilities to real ones. One can ask whether this mapping should respect probability
conservation without normalization by hand.
The variants of canonical identiﬁcation with some
additional conditions on probabilities satisﬁed for instance in p-adic thermodynamics provide a possible
manner to perform this map (see [K48] ). In [K79, K49] it is found that so called canonical identiﬁcation
seems to provide a tool to achieve this.
Canonical identiﬁcation in its basic form is deﬁned as I :
∞
P
k=0
αkpk 7→
∞
P
k=0
αkp−k.
Canonical identiﬁcation for rational numbers is deﬁned using the unique representation q = r/s as
I(r
s) = I(r)
I(s) .
(3.5.1)
Canonical identiﬁcation allows a further generalization to the case of p-adic thermodynamics where
Boltzmann weights bn are fundamental and their sum deﬁnes partition function as Z =
∞
P
n=0
gnbn,
where gn is the degeneracy of the state with a given “energy” (or any conserved quantity whose
thermal average is ﬁxed). In real thermodynamics Boltzmann weights are given by
b(En) = g(En)exp(−En/T) ,
(3.5.2)
where En is “energy” and g(En) the integer valued degeneracy of states with energy En. In p-Adic
thermodynamics the partition function would not converges for this form of Boltzmann weights, which
are therefore replaced by b(En) = g(En)pEn/T and En/T is integer valued to guarantee the p-adic
existence of the conformal weight. The quantization of En/T to integer values implies quantization
of both T and “energy” spectrum and forces so called super conformal invariance in applications of
topological geometrodynamics (see [K48, K80] ), which is indeed a basic symmetry of the theory [K17]
. Thus the mere number theoretical existence ﬁxes the physics to a high degree and indeed leads to the
understanding of elementary particle mass scales. For applications to the calculations of elementary
particle masses see [K48] .
In p-adic thermodynamics the probabilities would be given by pn = bn/Z and Nmax would be
replaced by Z. When bn are integers it is natural to deﬁne the canonical identiﬁcation as
I(pn) = I(bn
Z ) ≡I(bn)
I(Z) .
(3.5.3)
A physically very powerful additional constraint is that the additivity of probabilities for indepen-
dent events holds true also for the real counterparts of the p-adic probabilities obtained by canonical
identiﬁcation so that one would obtain also a real probability theory without ad hoc normalization of
the real images of p-adic probabilities. This condition is satisﬁed only if the Boltzman weights bn1 and

3.5. Generalization of NMP to the case of hyper-ﬁnite type II1 factors
131
bn2 for any pair (n1, n2) are p-adic integers having no common pinary digits so that no ”interference”
in the sum of the p-adic probabilities occurs.
The selection of a basis for independent events would correspond to a decomposition of the set
of integers labelling pinary digits to disjoint sets and brings in mind the selection of orthonormalized
basis of quantum states in quantum theory such that quantum measurement can give only one of
these states as an outcome. One can say that the probabilities deﬁne distributions of pinary digits
analogous to non-negative probability amplitudes in the space of integers labelling pinary digits,
and the probabilities of independent events must be orthogonal with respect to the inner product
P
n αnβnpn of integers x = αnpn and y = βnpn deﬁning analogs of wave functions in the space
of pinary digits. Or putting it somewhat diﬀerently: Boltzman weights bn for orthogonal quantum
states represent them as orthogonal states in the space of binary digits with orthogonality realized as
vanishing of the overlap for non-negative “wave functions”. This map puts strong constraints on the
probabilities of elementary independent events and is therefore highly interesting from the point of
view of physics.
p-Adic thermodynamics satisﬁes the constraint that p-adic probabilities have no common pinary
digits provided the degeneracies satisfy the condition g(En) < p (later a somewhat more general
conditions is deduced). For p-adic mass calculations (see [K41] ) the degeneracies g(n) of states with
conformal weight L0 = n (taking the role of “energy”) however increase exponentially so that the
condition is not satisﬁed for very large values of n. Since g(n) increases exponentially (say as 2nx,
where x is some parameter), probability conservation requires a cutoﬀof order nmax ∼log2(p) to the
number of terms in the sum deﬁning the partition function. In practice this cutoﬀhas no implications
since already the two lowest terms give excellent approximation to the elementary particle masses.
For instance, the value of p is M127 = 2127 −1 ∼1038 in the case of electron so that higher terms
in partition function Z are extremely small. The physical interpretation for the cutoﬀnmax would
be in terms of p-adic length scale hypothesis (see [K79, K49] stating that the length scales Lp ∝√p
with primes p ≃2k, k prime, are physically favored and the exponentially smaller p-adic length scale
Lk ∝
√
k deﬁnes the size scale of the elementary particle [K41] .
For the ordinary thermodynamics of strings the exponential increase gives rise to Hagedorn tem-
perature TH as the maximal temperature possible for strings (see [B8] ). The interpretation is that
the heat capacity of system grows without bound since the number of excited degrees of freedom
increases without bound as TH is approached. Clearly Hagedorn temperature is somewhat analogous
to the pinary cutoﬀin p-adic thermodynamics.
The interpretation of the conformal cutoﬀin terms of factors of type II1 factor would be that
all conformal weights n > ncr correspond to the same p-adic probability so that it is not possible to
distinguish experimentally between these states. This interpretation ﬁts nicely with the notions of
resolution and monitoring.
3.5.3
Factors of type III
For algebras of type III associated with non-separable Hilbert spaces all projectors have inﬁnite trace
so that the very notion of trace becomes obsolete.
The factors of type III1 are associated with
quantum ﬁeld theories in Minkowski space.
The highly counter-intuitive features of entanglement for type III factors are discussed in [C1] .
1. The von Neumann algebra deﬁned by the observables restricted to an arbitrary small region of
Minkowski space in principle generates the whole algebra. Expressed in a more technical jargon,
any ﬁeld state with a bound energy is cyclic for each local algebra of observables so that the
ﬁeld could be obtained in entire space-time from measurements in an arbitrary small region of
space-time. This kind of quantum holography looks too strong an idealization.
In TGD framework the replacement of Minkowski space-time with space-time sheet seems to
restrict the quantum holography to the boundaries of the space-time sheet. Furthermore, in TGD
framework the situation is nearer to the non-relativistic one since Poincare transformations are
not symmetries of space-time and because 3-surface is the fundamental unit of dynamics. Also
in TGD framework M 4 cm degrees of 3-surfaces are present but it would seem that they appear
as labels of type II1 factors in direct integral decomposition rather than as arguments of ﬁeld
operators.

132
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
2. The notion of pure state does not make sense in this case since the algebra lacks atoms and
projector traces do not deﬁne probabilities. The generalization of the notion of pure state as in
II1 case does not make sense since projectors have inﬁnite trace.
3. Entanglement makes sense but has very counter-intuitive properties. First of all, there is no
decomposition of density matrix in terms of projectors to pure states nor any obvious general-
ization of pure states. There exists no measure for the degree of entanglement, which is easy to
understand since one cannot assign probabilities to the projectors as their traces.
4. For any pair of space-like separated systems, a dense set of states violates Bell inequalities so that
correlations cannot be regarded as classical. This is in a sharp contrast with elementary quan-
tum mechanics, where ”de-coherence eﬀects” are believed to drive the states into a classically
correlated states.
5. No local measurement can remove the entanglement between a local system and its environment.
In TGD framework local operations would correspond to operations associated with a given
space-time sheet.
Irreducible type II1 entanglement between diﬀerent space-time sheets, if
indeed present, might have an interpretation in terms of a ﬁnite resolution at state space level
due to spin glass degeneracy.
On basis of these ﬁndings, one might well claim that the axiomatics of relativistic quantum ﬁeld
theories is not consistent with the basic physical intuitions.
3.6
Some consequences of NMP
In the sequel the most obvious consequences of self measurement and NMP are discussed from the
point of view of physics, biology, cognition, and quantum computing. The recent discussion diﬀers
considerably from the earlier one since several new elements are involved. Zero energy ontology and the
hierarchy of CDs, the hierarchy of Planck constants and dark matter, and -perhaps most importantly-
the better understanding negentropic entanglement as something genuinely new and making sense in
the interection of real and various p-adic worlds at which living matter is assumed to reside.
3.6.1
NMP and thermodynamics
The physical status of the second law has been a longstanding open issue in physics- in particular
biophysics.
In positive energy ontology the understanding of the origin of second law is simple.
Quantum jumps involve state function reduction (or more generally, self measurement) with a random
outcome and in the case of ensemble of identical system this leads to to a probability distribution for
the states of the members of the ensemble. This implies Boltzmann equations implying the second
law. In TGD framework there are many elements which force to question this simple picture: zero
energy ontology and CDs, eﬀective four-dimensionality of the ensemble deﬁned by states assignable
to sub-CDs, hierarchy of Planck constants, and the possibility of negentropic entanglement.
Zero energy ontology and thermodynamical ensembles
Zero energy ontology means that the thermodynamics appears both at the level of quantum states
and at the level of ensembles. At the level of quantum states this means that M-matrix can be seen
as a complex square root of the density matrix: ρ = MM †, where M is expressible as a product
of a positive and diagonal square root of density matrix and unitary S-matrix identiﬁable as the
S-matrix used in quantum physics. U matrix can be seen as a collection of M-matrices as will be
found later so that U-matrix ﬁxes M-matrices contrary to what was believed originally. One can say
that thermodynamics -at least in some sense- is represented at the level of single particle states. It is
natural to assume that this density matrix is measured in particle physics experiment, and that this
measurement corresponds to a state function reduction, which in standard physics picture corresponds
to a preparation for the initial states and state function reduction for the ﬁnal states.
The p-adic thermodynamics, which applies to conformal weights rather than energy, predicts
successfully elementary particle masses [K48] and should reduce to this thermodynamics. That p-adic
thermodynamics can be applied at all suggests that even elementary particles reside in the intersection

3.6. Some consequences of NMP
133
of the real and p-adic worlds so that either p-adic thermodynamics or real thermodynamics with
additional constraints on temperature implied by number theory applies.
Thermodynamical ensembles are 4-dimensional
The hierarchy of CDs within CDs deﬁnes a hierarchy of sub-systems and sub-CDs deﬁne in a natural
manner 4-dimensional ensemble.
If the state function reduction leads to unentangled states, the
outcome is an ensemble describable by the density matrix assignable to the single particle states. The
sequence of quantum jumps is expected to lead to a 4-D counterpart of thermodynamical ensemble and
thermodynamics results when one labels the states by the quantum numbers assignable to their positive
energy part. Entropy is assigned with entire 4-D CD rather than to its 3-dimensional time=constant
snapshots.
The thermodynamical time is basically the subjective time and measured in terms of
quantum jumps but has a correlation with geometric time as explained in [K3] and explained brieﬂy
below.
This picture diﬀers from the standard views, and this might explain the paradoxical situation in
cosmology resulting from the fact that the initial state of the universe in the standard sense of the
word looks highly entropic whereas second law would suggest the opposite [K74] . The cosmological
entropy is assigned with a CD of size scale deﬁned by the value of the age of the universe. In this
kind of situation each quantum jump replaces the zero energy state with a new one and also induces a
drift in the space of CDs to the direction of larger CDs with size deﬁned by the proper time distance
between the tips of CD coming as power of 2. Entropy as a function of cosmic time corresponds in
TGD framework to the increase of the 4-D entropy as a function of the quantized proper time distance
between the tips of the CD.
In this framework it is possible to understand second law in cosmic time scales apart from the
possible eﬀects related to the negentropic entanglement responsible for the evolution and breaking of
second law in arbitrarily long time scales. For instance, the number of sub-CDs increases meaning
the increase of the size of the ensemble and the emergence of new p-adic length scales as the size of
cosmic CD increases. What is fascinating is that the TGD counterpart of cosmic time is quantized
in powers of two. This might have predictable eﬀects such as the occurrence of the cosmic expansion
in a jump-wise manner. I have discussed an explanation of the accelerated cosmic expansion in terms
of quantum jumps of this kind but starting from somewhat diﬀerent picture [K74] .
How second law must be modiﬁed?
Second law as such does not certainly apply in TGD framework.
1. The hierarchy of CDs forces to introduce a fractal version of the second law taking into account
the p-adic length scale hypothesis and dark matter hierarchy. This means that the idea about
quantum parallel Universes generalizes to that of quantum parallel dissipating Universes. For
instance, the parton model of hadrons based on quarks and gluons relies on kinetic equations and
is basically thermodynamical whereas the model for hadron applied at low energies is quantum
mechanical. These two views are consistent if quantum parallel dissipation realized in terms of a
hierarchy of CDs is accepted. p-Adic length scale hierarchy with p-adic length scale hypothesis
stating that primes near powers of two are preferred corresponds to this dissipative quantum
parallellism. Dark matter hierarchy brings in a further dissipative quantum parallelism.
2. Second law should always be applied only at a given level of p-adic and dark matter hierarchy
and one must always take into account two time scales involved corresponding to the time scale
assignable to the system identiﬁable as the time scale characterizing corresponding CD and the
time scale in which the system is observed. Only if the latter time scale is considerably longer
than the CD time scale, second law is expected to make sense in TGD framework -this provided
one restricts the consideration to the entropic entanglement. The reason is that the Boltzmann
equations implying the second law require that the geometric time scale assignable to quantum
jump is considerably shorter than the time scale of observation: this guarantees that the random
nature of quantum jump allows to use statistical approach.
3. The possibility of negentropic entanglement in time scale of CD brings a further new element
strongly suggesting that the mechanical application of second law does to living matter does not

134
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
make sense. The basic time scales for CDs come as powers of two and the hierarchy of Planck
constants in the most general case allows rational multiples of these. If a restriction is made
to singular covering spaces of CD and CP2 (this might well be consistent with experimental
inputs), only integer multiples of these time scales are predicted at the level of dark matter. The
increase of Planck constant allows to scale up the time scale of quantum coherence associated
with the negentropic entanglement and this provides a further good reason for why large values
of Planck constant should be favored in living matter.
4. The reduction of entanglement entropy at single particle level implies the increase of thermo-
dynamical entropy at the level of ensemble in the case of entropic non-binding entanglement.
This applies also to bound state entanglement leading to a generation of entropy at the level of
binding systems and a reduction of the contribution of the bound systems to the entropy of the
entire system. Note however the emission of binding energy -say in form of photons- could take
care of the compensation so that entropy would be never reduced for ensemble. In the case of
negentropic entanglement the situation is diﬀerent.
The entropy of the negentropically entangled system is negative and the synenergic aspect of
negentropic entanglement means that the system does not contribute to thermodynamical en-
tropy. This means that second law could be broken in the geometric time scale considered. One
must of course be careful in distinguishing between geometric and subjective time. In the case
of subjective time the negentropic situation could continue forever unless the CD disappears in
some quantum jump (highly non-probable for large enough CDs). If not, then endless evolution
at the level of conscious experience is possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and
heat death is not the fate of the Universe as in ordinary thermodynamics.
5. The breaking of second law must correspond to the breaking of ergodicity. Spin glasses are non-
ergodic systems and TGD Universe is analogous to a 4-D quantum spin glass by the failure of
strict non-determinism of K¨ahler action reﬂecting itself as vacuum degeneracy. Does the quan-
tum spin glass property of the TGD universe imply the breaking of the second law? Gravitation
has been seen as one possible candidate for the breaking second law because of its long range
nature. It is indeed classical gravitational energy which distinguishes between almost degenerate
spin glass states. The huge value of gravitational Planck constant associated with space-time
sheets mediating gravitational interaction and making possible perturbative quantum treatment
of gravitational interaction would indeed suggest the breaking of second law in cosmological time
scales. For instance, black hole entropy which is inversely proportional to GM 2/ℏgr would be
for the values of gravitational Planck constant involved of the order of unity.
What do experiments say about second law?
That the status of the second law is far from settled is demonstrated by an experiment performed by
a research group in Australian National University [D4] . The group studied a system consisting of
100 small beads in water. One bead was shot by a laser beam so that it became charged and was
trapped. The container holding the beads was then moved from side to side 1000 times per second
so that the trapped bead dragged ﬁrst one way and then another. The system was monitored and
for monitoring times not longer than .1 seconds second law did not hold always: entropy could also
decrease.
1. What is remarkable that .1 seconds deﬁnes the duration τ of the memetic code word and cor-
responds to the secondary p-adic time scale Tp(2) = √pLp/c associated with Mersenne prime
p = M127 characterizing electron. This correspondence follows solely from the model of genetic
code predicting hierarchy of codes associated with p = 3, 7, 127 (genetic code), p = M127,... τ
should be the fundamental time scale of consciousness. For instance, average alpha frequency
10 Hz corresponds to this time scale and ’features’ inside cortex representing sensory percepts
have average duration of .1 seconds.
For electrons the CDs would have spatial size L = 3×107 meters, which is slightly smaller than
the circumference of Earth (L = cT, T = .1 s, the duration of sensory moment) so that they
would have a strong overlap. One can of course ask whether this is an accident. For instance,
the lowest Schumann frequency is around 7.8 Hz and not far from 10 Hz. What is interesting

3.6. Some consequences of NMP
135
that Bohr orbit model [K73] predicts that Universe might be populated by Earth like systems
having same distance from their Sun (stars with mass near that of Sun are very frequent). Bohr
orbitology applied to Earth itself could also lead to the quantization of the radius of Earth.
2. The ﬁrst observation was made for more than 15 years ago. Even more remarkable is the recent
observation that the time scale of CD associated with electron is .1 seconds. Can one assign the
breaking of the second law with the ﬁeld bodies of electrons?
3. The experiment involves also a millisecond time scale. I do not know whether it is essential that
the time scale is just this but one can play with the though that it is. Millisecond time scale is
roughly the duration of seventh bit of the genetic codeword if its bits correspond to CDs with
sizes coming as subsequence octaves of the basic time scale. Millisecond deﬁnes also the time
scale for the duration of the nerve pulse and the frequency of kHz cortical synchrony.
At the level of CDs millisecond time scale would correspond to a secondary p-adic time scale
assignable to k = 120. Only u and d quarks, which appear with several p-adic mass scales
in hadron physics and are predicted to be present as light variants also in nuclear physics as
predicted by TGD, could correspond to this p-adic length scale: the prediction for their mass
scale would be 5 MeV. Does this mean that the basic time scales of living matter correspond
directly to the basic time scales of elementary particle physics?
4. A further interesting point is that neutrinos correspond to .1 eV mass scale. This means that
the p-adic length scale is around k = 167 which means that the corresponding CD has time
scale which is roughly 240 times that for electron and corresponds to the primary p-adic length
scale of 2.5 µm (size of cellular nucleus) and tothe time scale of 104 years. I have proposed
that so called cognitive neutrino pairs consisting of neutrino and antineutrino assignable to
the opposite throats of wormhole contact could play key a role in the formation of cognitive
representations [K61] . This assumption looks now un-necessarily restrictive but one could quite
well consider the possibility that neutrinos are responsible for the longest time scales assignable
to consciousness for ordinary value of ℏ(not necessarily our consciousness!). Large value of ℏ
could make also possible the situation in which intermediate gauge bosons are eﬀectively massless
in cell length scale so that electro-weak symmetry breaking would be absent. This would require
ℏ≃233. For this value of ℏthe time scale of electronic CD is of the order of the duration of
human of human life cycle. This would scale up the Compton length of neutrino to about 10
kilometers and the temporal size of neutrino CD to a super-cosmological time scale.
3.6.2
NMP and self-organization
NMP leads to new vision about self-organization about which adetailed vision is discussed in [K69] .
Here only some key points are emphasized.
1. Dissipation selects the asymptotic self-organization patterns in the standard theory of self-
organization and the outcomes are interesting in the presence of energy feed. The feed of energy
can be generalized to feed of any kind of quantum numbers: for instance, feed of quantum num-
bers characterizing qualia. In fact, energy increment in quantum jump deﬁnes one particular
kind of quale [K28] .
2. The notion of self relates very closely to self-organization in TGD framework [K69] . Self is a
dissipative structure because it has subselves which dissipate quantum parallely with it. Self as
a perceiver maps the dissipation at the level of quantities in the external world to dissipation at
the level of qualia in the internal world.
3. Dissipation leads to self-organization patterns and in the absence of external energy feed to
thermal equilibrium. Thus thermodynamics emerges as a description for an ensemble of selves
or for the time average behavior or single self when external energy feed to system is absent. One
can also understand how the dissipative universe characterized by the presence of parameters
like diﬀusion constants, conductivities, viscosities, etc.. in the otherwise reversible equations of
motion, emerges. Dissipative dynamics is in a well deﬁned sense the envelope for the sequence of
reversible dynamical evolutions modelling the sequence of ﬁnal state quantum histories deﬁned
by quantum jumps.

136
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
4. Quantum self-organization can be seen as iteration of the unitary process followed by state
function reduction and leads to ﬁxed point self-organization patterns analogous to the patterns
emerging in Benard ﬂow. Since selves approach ’asymptotic selves’, dissipation can be regarded
as a Darwinian selector of both genes and memes. Thus not only surviving physical systems
but also stable conscious experiences of selves, habits, skills, behaviors, etc... are a result of
Darwinian selection.
5. In TGD one must distinguish between two kinds of self organizations corresponding to the
entropic bound state entanglement and negentropic entanglement. Biological self-organization
could be therefore fundamentally diﬀerent from the non-biological one. The succes of the p-adic
mass calculations suggest that even elementary particles live in the intersection of real and p-
adic worlds so that one should be very cautious in making strong conclusions. Certainly the
intentional, goal-directed behavior of the system in some time scale is a signature of negentropic
self-organization but it is diﬃcult to apply this criterion in time scales vastly diﬀerent from
human time scales. It is the ﬁeld bodies (or magnetic bodies) , which can be assigned naturally
to CDs which suggests that the negentropic self organization occurs at this level. TGD based
vision about living matter actually assumes this implicitly.
6. What is new that even quantum jump itself can be seen as a self-organization process analogous
to Darwinian selection, which eliminates all unbound entanglement and yields a state containing
only bound state state entanglement or negentropic entanglement and representing analog of the
self-organization patterns. By macro-temporal quantum coherence eﬀectively gluing quantum
jumps sequences to single quantum jump this pattern replicates itself fractally in various time
scales. Thus self-organization patterns can be identiﬁed as bound states and states paired by
a negentropic entanglement and the development of the self-organization pattern as a fractally
scaled up version of single quantum jump. Second new element is that dissipation is not mere
destruction of order but producer of jewels. A further new element is that dissipation can occur
in quantum parallel manner in various scales.
7. The failure of the determinism in standard sense for K¨ahler action is consistent with the clas-
sical description of dissipation. In particular, the emergence of sub-selves inside self looks like
dissipation from outside but corresponds to self-organization from the point of view of self. 4-
dimensional spin glass degeneracy meaning breaking of ergodicity crucial for self-organization is
highly suggestive on basis of the vacuum degeneracy of K¨ahler action, and this alone predicts
ultrametric topology for the landscape of the maxima of K¨ahler function deﬁned in terms of
K¨ahler action so that p-adicity emerges naturally also in this manner.
One particularly interesting concrete prediction is that the time scales assignable to CDs come
as powers of two. This predicts fundamental frequencies coming as powers of two, and the hierarchy
of Planck constants predicts rational or at least integer multiples of these frequencies. Could these
powers of two relate to frequency doubling rather generally observed in hydrodynamical self-organizing
systems?
3.6.3
NMP and p-adic length scale hypothesis
The original form of the p-adic length scale hypothesis stated that physically most interesting p-adic
primes satisfy p ≃2k , k prime or power of prime. It has however turned out that all positive integers
k are possible. Surprisingly few new length scales are predicted by this generalization in physically
interesting length scales. p-Adic length scale hypothesis leads to excellent predictions for elementary
particle masses (note that the mass prediction is exponentially sensitive to the value of k) and explains
also some interesting length scales of biology: for instance, the thicknesses of the cell membrane and
of single lipid layer of cell membrane correspond to k = 151 and k = 149 respectively.
The big problem of p-adic TGD is to derive this hypothesis from the basic structure of the theory.
1. One argument is based on black hole-elementary particle analogy [K53] leading to the general-
ization of the Hawking-Bekenstein formula: the requirement leading to the p-adic length scale
hypothesis is that the radius of the so called elementary particle horizon is itself a p-adic length
scale. This argument involves p-adic entropy essentially and it seems that information processing
is somehow involved.

3.6. Some consequences of NMP

2. Zero energy ontology predicts p-adic length scale hypothesis if one accepts the assumption that
the proper time distances between the tips of CDs come as powers of 2 [K53] . A more general
highly suggestive proposal is that the relative position between tips forms a lattice at proper
time constant hyperboloid having as a symmetry group discrete subgroup of Lorentz group
(which could reduce to a subgroup of the group SO(3) acting as isotropy group for the time-like
direction deﬁned by the relative coordinate between the tips of CD [K74] .
p-Adic length scale hypothesis could be understood as a resonance in frequency domain -most
naturally for massless particles like photons. The secondary p-adic time scale for favored p-adic
primes must be as near as possible to the proper time distance between the tips of CD. Mersenne
primes Mn = 2n −1 (n is prime) satisfy this condition. Also log(p) is in this case as near as
possible to log(2n) and in the sense that the unit of negentropy deﬁned as log(2n−m(n))/log(2n)
is maximized. This argument might work also for Gaussian Mersennes Gn = (1 + i)n −1 (n is
prime also now) if one restricts the consideration to Gaussian primes.
A more general and more realistic looking hypothesis is that a given CD can have partonic light-
like 3-surfaces ending at its boundaries for all p-adic length scales up to that associated with
CD: powers of 2 would be favored by the condition of commeasurability very much analogous
to frequency doubling.
3. An exciting possibility, suggested already earlier half seriously, is that evolution is present already
at elementary particle level. This is the case if elementary particles reside in the intersection
of real and p-adic worlds.
The success of p-adic mass calculations and the identiﬁcation of
p-adic physics as physics of cognition indeed forces this interpretation. In particular, one can
understand p-adic length scale hypothesis as reﬂecting the survival of the cognitively ﬁttest
p-adic topologies.
I have discussed also other explanations.
1. A possible physical reason for the primes near prime powers of 2 is that survival necessitates
the ability to co-operate, to act in resonance: this requirement might force commeasurability
of the length scales for p-adic space-time sheet (p1) glued to larger space-time sheet (p2 > p1).
The hierarchy would state from 2-adic level having characteristic fractal length scales coming as
powers of
√
2. When p > 2 space-time sheet is generated during cosmological evolution L(p) for
it must correspond to power of
√
2 so that one must have p ≃2n.
2. A model for learning [K14] as a transformation of the reﬂective level of consciousness to proto
level supports the view that evolution and learning occur already at elementary particle level
as indeed suggested by NMP: the p-adic primes near power of prime powers of two are the
ﬁttest ones. The core of the argument is the characterization of learning as a map from 2N
many-fermion states to M association sequences. The number of association sequences should
be as near as possible equal to 2N. If M is power of prime: M = pK, association sequences
can be given formally the structure of a ﬁnite ﬁeld G(p, K) and p-adic length scale hypothesis
follows as a consequence of K = 1. NMP provides the reason for why M = pK is favored: in
this case one can construct realization of quantum computer with entanglement probabilities
pk = 1/M = 1/pK and the negentropy gain in quantum jump is Klog(p) while for M not
divisible by p the negentropy gain is zero.
3.6.4
NMP and biology
The notion of self is crucial for the understanding of bio-systems and consciousness. It seems that
the negentropic entanglement is the decisive element of life and that one can say that in metaphoral
sense life resides in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
Life as islands of rational/algebraic numbers in the seas of real and p-adic continua?
Rational and even algebraic entanglement coeﬃcients make sense in the intersection of real and p-adic
words, which suggests that life and conscious intelligence reside in the intersection of the real and
p-adic worlds. This would mean that the mathematical expressions for the space-time surfaces (or
at least 3-surfaces or partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D tangent planes) make sense in both real and

138
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
p-adic sense for some primes p. Same would apply to the expressions deﬁning quantum states. In
particular, entanglement probabilities would be rationals or algebraic numbers so that entanglement
can be negentropic and the formation of bound states in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds
generates information and is thus favored by NMP.
The identiﬁcation of intentionality as the basic aspect of life seems to be consistent with this idea.
1. The proposed realization of the intentional action has been as a transformation of p-adic space-
time sheet to a real one. Also transformations of real space-time sheets to p-adic space-time
sheets identiﬁable as cognitions are possible. Algebraic entanglement is a prerequisite for the
realization of intentions in this manner. Essentially a leakage between p-adic and real worlds is
in question and makes sense only in zero energy ontology. The reason is that various quantum
numbers in real and p-adic sectors are not in general comparable in positive energy ontology so
that conservation laws would be broken or even cease to make sense.
2. The transformation of intention to action can occur if the partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D
tangent space-distributions are representable using rational functions with rational (or even
algebraic) coeﬃcients in preferred coordinates for the imbedding space dictated by symmetry
considerations. Intentional systems must live in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
3. For the minimal option life would be also eﬀectively 2-dimensional phenomenon and essentially a
boundary phenomenon as also number theoretical criticality suggests. There are good reasons to
expect that only the data from the intersection of real and p-adic partonic two-surfaces appears
in U-matrix so that only the data from rational and some algebraic points of the partonic 2-
surface dictate U-matrix. This means discretization at parton level and something which might
be called number theoretic quantum ﬁeld theory should emerge as a description of intentional
action.
A good guess is that algebraic entanglement is essential for quantum computation, which therefore
might correspond to a conscious process. Hence cognition could be seen as a quantum computation
like process, a more approriate term being quantum problem solving [K23] . Living-dead dichotomy
could correspond to rational-irrational or to algebraic-transcendental dichotomy: this at least when
life is interpreted as intelligent life. Life would in a well deﬁned sense correspond to islands of rational-
ity/algebraicity in the seas of real and p-adic continua. Life as a critical phenomenon in the number
theoretical sense would be one aspect of quantum crticality of TGD Universe besides the criticality
of the space-time dynamics and the criticality with respect to phase transitions changing the value of
Planck constant and other more familiar criticalities. How closely these criticalities relate remains an
open question [K69] .
The view about the crucial role of rational and algebraic numbers as far as intelligent life is
considered, could have been guessed on very general grounds from the analogy with the orbits of a
dynamical system. Rational numbers allow a predictable periodic decimal/pinary expansion and are
analogous to one-dimensional periodic orbits. Algebraic numbers are related to rationals by a ﬁnite
number of algebraic operations and are intermediate between periodic and chaotic orbits allowing an
interpretation as an element in an algebraic extension of any p-adic number ﬁeld. The projections of
the orbit to various coordinate directions of the algebraic extension represent now periodic orbits. The
decimal/pinary expansions of transcendentals are un-predictable being analogous to chaotic orbits.
The special role of rational and algebraic numbers was realized already by Pythagoras, and the fact
that the ratios for the frequencies of the musical scale are rationals supports the special nature of
rational and algebraic numbers. The special nature of the Golden Mean, which involves
√
5, conforms
the view that algebraic numbers rather than only rationals are essential for life.
That only algebraic extensions are possible is of course only a working hypothesis. Also ﬁnite-
dimensional extensions of p-adic numbers involving transcendentals are possible and might in fact be
necessary. Consider for instance the extension containing e, e2, .., ep−1 as units (ep is ordinary p-adic
number. Inﬁnite number of analogous ﬁnite-dimensional extensions can be constructed by taking a
function of integer variable such that f(p) exists both p-adically and as a real transcendental number.
The powers of f(p)1/n for a ﬁxed value of n deﬁne a ﬁnite-dimensional transcendental extension of
p-adic numbers if the roots do not exist p-adically.
Numbers like log(p) and π cannot belong to a ﬁnite-dimensional extension of p-adic numbers [K27]
. One cannot of course take any strong attitude concerning the possibility of inﬁnite-dimensional ex-
tensions of p-adic numbers but the working hypothesis has been that they are absent. The phases

3.6. Some consequences of NMP
139
exp(i2π/n) deﬁne ﬁnite dimensional extensions allowing to replace the notion of angle in ﬁnite mea-
surement resolution with the corresponding phase factors in ﬁnite measurement.
The functions
exp(i2πq/n), where q is arbitrary p-adic integers deﬁne in a natural manner the physical counter-
parts of plane waves and angular momentum eigenstates not allowing an identiﬁcation as ordinary
p-adic exponential functions. They are clearly strictily periodic functions of q with a ﬁnite value set.
If n is divisible by a power of p, these functions are continuous since the values of the function for q
and q + kpn are identical for large enough values of n. This condition is essential and means in the
case of plane waves that the size scale of a system (say one-dimensional box) is multiple of a power of
p.
Evolution and second law
Evolution has many facets in TGD framework.
1. A natural characterization of evolution is in terms of p-adic topology relating naturally to cog-
nition. p-Adic primes near powers of two are favored if CDs have the proposed discrete size
spectrum. From the point of view of self this would be essentially cosmic expansion in discrete
jumps. CDs and can be characterized by powers of 2 and if partonic 2-surfaces correspond to ef-
fective p-adic p-adic topology characterized by a power of two, one obtains the commeasurability
of the secondary p-adic time scale of particle and that of CD in good approximation.
2. The notion of inﬁnite primes motivates the hypothesis that the many-sheeted structure of space-
time can be coded by inﬁnite primes [K78] . The number of primes larger than given inﬁnite
prime P is inﬁnitely larger than the number of primes than P. The inﬁnite prime P characteriz-
ing the entire universe decomposes in a well deﬁned manner to ﬁnite primes and p-adic evolution
at the level of entire universe is implied by local p-adic evolution at the level of selves. Therefore
maximum entanglement negentropy gain for p-adic self increases at least as log(p) with p in the
long run. This kind of relationship might hold true for real selves of p-adic physics is physics of
cognitive representations of real physics as suggested by the success of p-adic mass calculations.
Thus it should be possible to assign deﬁnite p-adic prime to each partonic 2-surface.
3. A further aspect of evolution relates to the hierarchy of Planck constants implying that at dark
matter levels rational or at least integer multiples of the favored p-adic time scales are realized.
The latter option is favored by the idea that the book like structure with pages consisting
of many-sheeted coverings of CD and CP2, and correlates with the emergence of algebraic
extensions of p-adic numbers deﬁned by the roots exp(i2π/n) of unity. For the latter option
evolution by quantum jumps would automatically imply the drifting of the partonic 2-surfaces
to the pages of books labelled by increasing values of Planck constant. For more general option
one might argue that drifting to pages with small values of Planck constant is also possible. This
would give kind of antizooms of long length scale physics to short scales. Both kind of temporal
zooms could be crucial for conscious intelligence building scaled models about time evolution in
various scales.
4. The generation of negentropic entanglement between diﬀerent number ﬁelds would of course be
the fundamental aspect of evolution. It would give rise to increasingly complex and negentropic
sensory perceptions and cognitive representations based on conscious rules coded by negentropic
entanglement. This would justify the association concept as it used in neuro-science. Negentropic
entanglement could be also crucial for the basic mechanism of metabolism and make possible
conscious co-operation even in nano-scales.
Just for fun one can play also with numbers.
1. The highest dark matter level associated with self corresponds to its geometric duration which
can be arbitrarily long: the typical duration of the memory span gives an idea about the level
of dark matter hierarchy involved if one assumes that the time scale .1 seconds assignable to
electrons is the fundamental time scale. If the time scale T of human life cycle corresponds to a
secondary p-adic time scale then T = 100 years gives the rough estimate r ≡ℏ/ℏ0 = 233 if this
time scale corresponds to that for dark electron. The corresponding primary p-adic time length
scale corresponds to k = 160 and is 2.2 × 10−7 meters.

140
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
2. If human time scale -taken to be T = 100 years- corresponds to primary p-adic time scale of
electron, one must have roughly r = 297.
I have already discussed the second law in TGD framework and it seems that its applies only when
the time scale of perception is longer than the time scale characterizing the level of the p-adic and
dark matter hierarchy. Second law as it is usually stated can be seen as an unavoidable implication
of the materialistic ontology.
Stable entanglement and quantum metabolism as diﬀerent sides of the same coin
The notion of binding has two meanings. Binding as a formation of bound state and binding as a
fusion of mental images to larger ones essential for the functioning of brain and regarded as one the
big problems of consciousness theory.
Only bound state entanglement and negentropic entanglement are stable against the state reduc-
tion process. Hence the fusion of the mental images implies the formation of a bound entropic state-
in this case the two interpretations of binding are equivalent- or a negentropic state, which need not
be bound state.
1. In the case of negentropic entanglement bound state need not be formed and the interesting
possibility is that the negentropic entanglement could give rise to stable states without binding
energy. This could allow to understand the mysterious high energy phosphate bond to which
metabolic energy is assigned in ATP molecule containing three phosphates and liberated as
ATP decays to ADP and phosphate molecule. Negentropic entanglement could also explain the
stability of DNA and other highly charged biopolymers. In this framework the liberation of
metabolic (negentropic) energy would involve dropping of electrons to a larger space-time sheets
accompanying the process ATP →ADP + Pi. A detailed model of this process is discussed
in [K26] .
2. The formation of bound state entanglement is expected to involve a liberation of the binding
energy and this energy might be a usable energy.
This process could perhaps be coined as
quantum metabolism and one could say that quantum metabolism and formation of bound
states are diﬀerent sides of the same coin. It is known that an intense neural activity, although
it is accompanied by an enhanced blood ﬂow to the region surrounding the neural activity,
does not involve an enhanced oxidative metabolism [J45] (that is ATP →ADP process and
its reversal). A possible explanation is that quantum metabolism accompanying the binding is
involved. Note that the bound state is sooner or later destroyed by the thermal noise so that
this mechanism would in a rather clever manner utilize thermal energy by applying what might
be called buy now–pay later principle.
If these interpretations are correct, there would be two modes of metabolism corresponding to two
diﬀerent kinds of fusion of mental images.
3.6.5
NMP, consciousness, and cognition
As already found NMP dictates the subjective time development of self and is therefore the basic law
of consciousness. If p-adic physics is the physics of cognition, the most exotic implications of NMP
relate to cognition rather than standard physics.
Thermodynamics for qualia
If only entropic entanglement is assumed, second law seems to hold also at the level of conscious experi-
ence of self, which can be seen as an ensemble of its subselves assignable to sub-CDs. The randomness
of the state function reduction process implies that conscious experience involves statistical aspects in
the sense that the experienced qualia correspond to the averages of quantum number and zero mode
increments over the sub-selves assignable to sub-CDs. When the number of quantum jumps in the
ensemble deﬁning self increases, qualia get more entropic and fuzzy unless macro-temporal quantum
coherence changes the situation.
Negentropic entanglement means departure from this picture if sub-CDs can generate negentropic
entanglement. This is expected to be true if they overlap if one believes on standard argument for the

3.6. Some consequences of NMP
141
formation of macroscopic quantum phases. In this case the ﬂux tubes connecting space-time sheets
assignable to the sub-CDs would serve as a space-time correlate for the negentropic entanglement.
The basic questions are whether sensory qualia can really correspond to the increments of quantum
numbers in quantum jump and whether these quantum jumps are assignable to entropic or negentropic
qualia. What is clear that the sensory qualia such as colors are assigned to an object of external world
rather predictably. This is not obvious if this process is based on quantum jump.
1. Qualia are determined basically as increments of quantum numbers [K28] whereas in ordinary
statistical physics measured quantities would correspond to quantum numbers basically. The
basic function of sensory organs is to map quantum numbers to quantum number increments so
that our sensory perception is in reasonable approximation about world rather than changes of
the world.
2. In zero energy ontology the increments must correspond to increments of quantum numbers for
(say) positive energy part of the state. A sensation of (say) given color requires a continual
feed of corresponding quantum number increment to the positive energy part of the system.
Some kind of far from equilibrium thermodynamics seems to be necessary with external feed of
quantum numbers generalizing the external feed of energy. The capacitor model of a sensory
receptor [K28] realizes this idea in terms of generalized di-electric breakdown implying opposite
charging of the capacitor plates in question. Note that in zero energy ontology also the positive
and negative energy parts of the zero energy state assignable to capacitor plates would be also
analogous to a pair of oppositely charged capacitor plates and one can speak about capacitor
also in time direction.
3. If entropic entanglement is reduced to zero in quantum jump for individual sensory recepto, the
outcome involves all possible values of quale, say diﬀerent fundamental colors for which I have
proposed a model in terms of QCD color [K28] . If the probability of particular value of quale
is much larger than others, one can have statistical ensemble giving rise to predictable quale as
ensemble average.
4. If negentropic entanglement is in question, similar situation is encountered but the perception is
a mixture of qualia. For large values of p-adic prime one could have almost complete dominance
of a particular instance of quale also now. One could argue that the perception represents also
the deﬁnition of the concept of a particular quale as a superposition of pairs of consisting of the
state inducing the instance of the quale and the state representing it. The fact that there are
very many negentropic superpositions however suggests that the superposition represents both
the deﬁnition of quale and average value of quale. For instance, the fusion of various colors could
rely on negentropic entanglement.
5. Both these representations of qualia could realized and one can ask whether the entropic repre-
sentation could be aesthetically less pleasing than the negentropic representation involving also
the notion of quale.
Questions about various kinds of entropies
There are three kinds of entropies and the basic question is how these entropies relate.
1. Does the entropy characterizing the experience of self relate to the thermodynamical entropy
of some system? The fact that non-geometric sensory qualia have a statistical interpretation,
suggests that the entropy associated with the qualia of the mental image corresponds to the
thermodynamical entropy for a system giving rise to the qualia via the sensory mapping. The
thermodynamics of quantities in the external world would thus be mapped to the thermody-
namics of qualia, increments of quantities, in the inner world. Selves could also represent the
fundamental thermodynamical ensembles since they deﬁne also statistical averages of quantum
numbers and zero modes although these are not directly experienced.
2. Could one interpret the entropies of the space-time sheets as entropies associated with the
symbolic representations of conscious experiences of selves? Could one see the entire classical
reality as a symbolic representation? Does the entropy of conscious experience correspond to

142
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
the thermodynamical entropy of the perceived system, which in turn would correspond to the
classical space-time entropy of the system representing the perceived system symbolically? Does
this conclusion generalize to the case of p-adic entropy?
Quantum-classical correspondence
would encourage to cautiously think that the common answer to these questions might be yes.
The arrow of psychological time and second law
The arrow of psychological time is closely related to the second law and I have considered several
alternative identiﬁcations for the arrow of psychological time.
These identiﬁcations are discussed
in [K86, K3, K87] . The latest option favored by zero energy ontology is discussed in [K3] and involves
two aspects: the one related to the arrow of time coordinate assignable to the space-time sheet and
the other one to the relative proper time coordinate between the tips of CD.
A simple argument show that this distance quantized in powers of 2 should increase gradually
in statistical sense since the size of CD can also change in quantum jump. This would have have
interpretation in terms of a ﬂow of ”cosmic time” (CD is analogous to big bang followed by big
crunch).
Interestingly, CD with time scale of order 1011 years (age of the universe) corresponds
primary p-adic length scale of only only 10−4 meters, the size of a large neuron, and also the length
scale in which the blob of water has Planck mass so that the quantization of gravitational Planck
constant should become important [K73] . Could this mean that the CDs assignable to large neurons
make possible to develop the idea about the cosmology and cosmology itself? Could it really be that
that our cognitive representations about Universe quite concretely have the size of the Universe itself
as p-adic view about cognition requires?
Quantum jump and cognition
The fusion of subselves can take place in two manners: by real bound state entanglement and by
negentropic entanglement. The resulting mental images must diﬀer somehow, and the proposal is that
the entanglement associated with the negentropic mental deﬁnes a conscious cognitive representation:
kind of rule. Schr¨odinger cat negentropically entangled with the bottle of poison knows that it is not a
good idea to open the bottle: open bottle-dead cat, closed bottle-living cat. Negentropic entanglement
would generate rules and counterparts of conscious associations fundamental in brain functioning. For
the mental image associated with bound state entanglement the information about bound systems
would be lost. Bound state entanglement could however give rise to stereo-consciousness essential for
(say) stereo vision.
One can imagine several kinds of negentropic entanglements of this kind. Between two real systems,
between real and p-adic systems, and between two p-adic systems possibly characterized by diﬀerent
values of p: all these systems assigned with distinct but overlapping CDs.
These entanglements
would correspond to diﬀerent aspects of conscious experience. Maybe the real-real entanglement could
correspond to a positive emotion- perhaps love-, and the remaining to experiences of understanding
generating a connection between two diﬀerent things: between real world even and its cognitive
representation or between two cognitive representations. Note that the entanglement probabilities can
vary considerably and one can obtain identical a spectrum of entanglement probabilities by permuting
them. This should relate to the character of the experiencence of understanding. Schr¨odinger cat which
is almost dead has strong conviction that it is better to not open the bottle. The optimal situation
concerning understanding would be identical probabilities.
Analysis and conceptualization (synthesis) - formation of rules- could be seen as the reductionistic
and holistic aspects of consciousness.
The interpretation of quantum jump as a creation of a to-
tally entangled holistic state, which is then analyzed to stable entangled pieces allows to interpret self
measurement cascade as a conscious analysis. The resulting stable negentropic pieces give rise to expe-
rience of understanding and conceptualization - rules and abstractions. Perhaps the holistic character
assigned ot right brain hemisphere could be interpreted in terms of specialization to conceptualization
and reductionist character of left brain to entropic analysis to smallest possible pieces.
There are rather interesting connections with altered states of consciousness and states of macro-
temporal quantum coherence.
1. Making mind empty of mental images could perhaps be interpreted as a mechanism of achieving
irreducible self state. If self entangles negentropically with larger conscious entity this would
lead to experiences characterized as expansion of consciousness, even cosmic consciousness. One

3.6. Some consequences of NMP
143
could also consider the possibility the sub-selves representing mental images fuse to single long-
lasting negentropic mental image.
The absence of dissipation could relate to the reports of
meditators about lowered metabolic needs.
2. The ordinary wake-up consciousness is identiﬁable as the analytical mode in which entropic
entanglement dominates so that each U process is followed by a rather complete state function
reduction. The reason for this could be sensory input and motor activities, which would create
eﬀective heat bath destroying holistic mental images.
3. Krishnamurti has talked a lot about states of consciousness in which no separations and discrim-
inations occur and timelessness prevails. These states could correspond to long-lived negentropic
entanglement with large ℏwith larger conscious entities giving rise to very long eﬀective mo-
ments of consciousness. In this kind of situation NMP does not force cognitive self measurements
to occur and analysis and separations can thus be avoided.
4. Sharing and fusion of mental images by entanglement of sub-selves of separate selves makes
possible quantum realization of telepathy and could be a universal element of altered states
of consciousness. Also this entanglement could be bound state entanglement or negentropic
entanglement.
Cognitive codes
p-Adic length scale hypothesis leads to the idea that each p ≃2k, k integer, deﬁnes a hierarchy of
cognitive codes with code word having duration given by the n-ary p-adic time scale T(n, k) and
number of bits given by any factor of k. Especially interesting codes are those for which the number
of bits is prime factor or power of prime factor of k. n = 2 seems to be in special position in zero
energy ontology. This is a strong quantitative prediction since the duration of both the code word
and bit correspond to deﬁnite frequencies serving as signatures for the occurrence of commutations
utilizing these codes.
If k is prime, the amount of information carried by the codon is maximal but there is no obvious
manner to detect errors.
If k is not prime there are several codes with various numbers of bits:
information content is not maximal but it is possible to detect errors. For instance, k = 252 gives
rise to code words for which the number of bits is k1 = 252, 126, 63, 84, 42, 212, 9, 7, 62, 4, 32, 2: the
subscript 2 tells that there are two non-equivalent manners to get this number of bits. For instance,
126 = 42 × 3-bit codon can have 42 -bit parity codon: the bits of this codon would be products of
three subsequent bits of 126-bit codon. This allows error detection by comparing the error codon for
communicated codon and communicated error codon.
Abstraction hierarchy and genetic code
Mersenne primes Mn = 2n −1, which seem to play fundamental role in elementary particle physics
and it has been already found that their emergence is natural consequence of NMP. This would put
primes 3, 7, 31, 127, etc. in a special position. Primes appear frequently in various bio-structures
and this might reﬂect the underlying p-adicity for the association sequences providing ’plan’ for the
development of bio-system. For instance, we have actually 7 (!) ﬁngers: two of them have degenerated
during evolution but can be seen in the developing embryo. There are 31 subunits in our spinal chord,
etc...
In the model of genetic code based on a simple model of abstraction process [K31] the so called
Combinatorial Hierarchy 2, 3, 7, 127, 2127 −1, ... of Mersenne primes emerges naturally. The construc-
tion for a model of abstraction process proceeds as follows.
1. At lowest level there are two digits. The statements Yes and No.
2. At the next level one considers all Boolean statements about these two statements which can be
regarded as maps from 2-element set to 2-element set. There are 4 of them. Throw one away
and you get 3 statements.
3. At the next level one considers all Boolean statements about these 3 statements and the total
number of them is 23. Throw one away and you get 7 statements. And so on.

144
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
The mystery is why one statement must be thrown away at each level of the construction. The
answer might relate to a concrete model of quantum computation.
1. A possible neurolevel realization of a quantum computation is following. Entangle in the pro-
posed manner two memetic codewords represented as temporal sequences of 127 cognitive Z0
magnetized antineutrino ensembles with bit represented as the magnetization direction. The
phase transitions changing the direction of magnetization are assumed to involve classical non-
determinism.
2. Nerve pulse (or pulse like membrane oscillation) results from each ﬂip of the direction of the Z0
magnetization. The temporal sequence for which all Z0 magnetization are in the the direction of
the external Z0 magnetic ﬁeld is excluded because this state does not give rise to a nerve pulse
pattern (or membrane oscillation pattern). In this manner a quantum computer with N = 1
and p = 2127 −1 results. Incoming nerve pulse patterns could be taken to be identical memetic
codewords and out would go a a pair of memetic codewords representing the initial memetic
codeword and the result of the quantum computation.
The duration of the computation is
.1 seconds and involves 2127 −1 quantum jumps eﬀectively glued to single quantum jump by
macro-temporal quantum coherence.
The concepts of resolution and monitoring
The following considerations represent a rather early idea related to p-adic physics, and I am not sure
whether to take it seriously or not. The basic observation is that genuinely p-adic probabilities can
sum up to zero, and this might make possible some rather exotic looking eﬀects in genuinely p-adic
sectors of state space.
When the fundamental observable (density matrix or entropy operator) has degenerate eigenvalues,
one can only speak about probability for quantum jump to a particular eigen space of the the observable
since there is no preferred basis in this eigen space. This leads to the concept of cognitive resolution:
one cannot distinguish between states belonging to a given eigen space of density matrix and one can
make predictions for the probabilities for quantum jumps to given eigen space only.
1. Resolution and monitoring
p-Adic probability concept allows to consider an additional exotic eﬀect.
1. The total real probability for quantum jump to degenerate subspace is the real counterpart for
sum of p-adic probabilities rather than sum of the real counterparts of the p-adic probabilities.
This can lead to rather dramatic eﬀects: for instance, the sum of p-adic probabilities can be
very small even when the sum of the real probabilities is large.
2. The notion of resolution is closely related to the notion of monitoring: resolution can be deﬁned
as a decomposition of the p-adic state space to a direct sum of subspaces such that the p-adic
density matrix is degenerate inside each subspace. If p-adic probabilities are deﬁned modulo
O(p) pinary cutoﬀthis kind of degeneracy is bound to occur if the dimension of the state space
is larger than p.
An interesting possibility is that the notions of resolution and monitoring could be important in the
physics of cognition. Perhaps the well-known fact that the behavior of cognitive systems is sensitive
to monitoring, might have something to do with the density matrix characterizing the entanglement
between the monitoring and monitored systems. The behavior of monitored system would depend on
the resolution of the monitoring, that is on how interested monitorer is about behavior of monitored
system. In the limit that monitorer is not interested at all on the behavior, entanglement probabilities
would in general be identical and unless the number of states is power of p, S = 0 state would result.
The total probability for a set of independent events to occur depends on the resolution of mon-
itoring: not only the behavior of individual quantum system in ensemble but also the statistical
behavior of the ensemble of systems characterized by same p-adic prime depends on the resolution of
the monitoring.
Standard probability theory, which also lies at the root of the standard quantum theory, predicts
that the probability for a certain outcome of experiment does not depend on how the system is

3.6. Some consequences of NMP

monitored.
For instance, if system has N outcomes o1, o2, ...oN with probabilities p1, ..., pN then
the probability that o1 or o2 occurs does not depend on whether common signature is used for o1
and o2 or whether observer also detects which of these outcomes occurs. The crucial signature of
p-adic probability theory is that monitoring aﬀects the behavior of the system. NMP provides precise
deﬁnition for the concept of monitoring. There are two forms of monitoring depending on whether
the fundamental observable, denote it by O, is density matrix or entropy operator.
Consider ﬁrst the situation in which all entanglement probabilities have p-adic norm diﬀerent from
unity. Physically monitoring is represented by quantum entanglement and diﬀerentiates between two
eigen states of O (density matrix or entropy operator) only provided the eigenvalues of O are diﬀerent.
If there are several degenerate eigenvalues, quantum jump occurs to any state in the eigen space and
one can predict only the total probability for the quantum jump into this eigen space. Hence the p-adic
probability for a quantum jump to a given eigen space of density matrix is p-adic sum of probabilities
over the eigen states belonging to this eigen space:
Pi =
(n(i)P(i))R
P
j(n(j)P(j))R
.
Here ni are dimensions of various eigen spaces.
If the degeneracy of the eigenvalues is removed by an arbitrary small perturbation, the total
probability for the transition to the same subspace of states becomes the sum for the real counterparts
of probabilities and one has in good approximation:
P R =
n(i)P(i)R
[P
j̸=i
P
j(n(j)P(j))R + n(i)P(i)R] .
Rather dramatic eﬀects could occur. Suppose that that the entanglement probability P(i) is of
form P(i) = np, n ∈{0, p −1} and that n is large so that (np)R = n/p is a considerable fraction of
unity. Suppose that this state becomes degenerate with a degeneracy m and mn > p as integer. In this
kind of situation modular arithmetics comes into play and (mnp)R appearing in the real probability
P(1 or 2) can become very small. The simplest example is n = (p+1)/2: if two states i and j have very
nearly equal but not identical entanglement probabilities P(i) = (p + 1)p/2 + ϵ, P(j) = (p + 1)p/2 −ϵ,
monitoring distinguishes between them for arbitrary small values of ϵ and the total probability for the
quantum jump to this subspace is in a good approximation given by
P(1 or 2)
≃
x
hP
k̸=i,j(Pk)R + x
i ,
x
=
2 [(p + 1)p/2]R .
(3.6.1)
and is rather large. For instance, for Mersenne primes x ≃1/2 holds true. If the two states become
degenerate then one has for the total probability
P(1 or 2)
≃
x
hP
k̸=i,j(Pk)R + x
i ,
x
=

p .
(3.6.2)
The order of magnitude for P(1 or 2) is reduced by a factor of order 1/p!
A test for the notion of p-adic quantum cognition would be provided by the study of the de-
pendence of the transition rates of quantum systems on the resolution of monitoring deﬁned by the
dimensions of the degenerate eigen spaces of the subsystem density matrix (or entropy operator).
One could even consider the possibility of measuring the value of the p-adic prime in this manner.
The behavior of living systems is known to be sensitive to monitoring and an exciting possibility is
that this sensitivity, if it really can be shown to have statistical nature, could be regarded as a direct
evidence for TGD inspired theory of consciousness. Note that the mapping of the physical quantities
to entanglement probabilities could provide an ideal manner to compare physical quantities with huge

146
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
accuracy! Perhaps bio-systems have invented this possibility before physicists and this could explain
the miraculous accuracy of biochemistry in realizing genetic code.
If some entanglement probabilities have unit norm so that their contributions to the p-adic en-
tanglement entropy vanish, quantum jump to an entangled ﬁnal state can occur: this is genuinely
p-adic eﬀect and serves as a second test for p-adic cognition. If density matrix is the fundamental
observable, quantum jump can occur to an entangled ﬁnal state, which corresponds to any S = 0
subspace of S = 0 eigen space of the entropy operator with is eigen space of the density matrix. If
entropy operator is the fundamental observable, quantum jump can occur to any S = 0 subspace of
entropy operator. Again the total probability for the transition is determined by the p-adic sum of
the probabilities and dramatic ’interference’ eﬀects at the level of probabilities are possible.
Resolution and monitoring and hyperﬁnite factors of type II1
The notion of resolution emerges naturally for the hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1. The trace of the
unit operator is unit for the inﬁnite-dimensional space in question so that any projector with a ﬁnite
trace must project to an inﬁnite dimensional space so that there would always an inﬁnite-dimensional
degeneracy involved with the eigenvalues of the measured observables.
One could however consider the formulation of the theory in terms of p-adic probabilities and
for this formulation resolution and monitoring emerge naturally. One could go even further. For
instance, if one can specify the inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom as a p-adic integer, say N =
−1 = (p −1) P∞
k=0 pk, which in a well-deﬁned sense represents the largest p-adic integer, one can
say that the p-adic probability for a given state is 1/N and ﬁnite as a p-adic number. It is ﬁnite
also as a real number and equal to 1/p if canonical identiﬁcation is used to map N to a real number.
For a given ﬁnite-dimensional density matrix with ﬁnite number of distinct eigenvalues it would be
possible to have projections to one-dimensional subspace but there would always inﬁnitely degenerate
eigenvalue present in accordance with the notion of ﬁnite resolution.
A natural question concerns the implications of the assumption that the map of p-adic probabilities
to real ones conserves probabilities without additional normalization.
3.6.6
NMP and quantum computer type systems
TGD Universe can be regarded as an inﬁnite quantum computer. Unitarity process U is analogous
to a quantum computation. The state function reduction process represents a stepwise halting of the
computation proceeding until the resulting states are eith bound states or negentropically entangled
states. U matrix is between zero energy states and can be regarded as a collection of M-matrices
labelled by zero energy states. The possibility of two kinds of entropic and negentropic entanglement
makes possible two kinds of quantum computations and negentropic quantum computations based on
states which are longlived by the properties of the negentropic entanglement could be the one realized
in living matter.
The relationship between U-matrix and M-matrix
Before proceeding it is a good idea to clarify the relationship between the notions of U-matrix and M-
matrix. If state function reduction associated with time-like entanglement leads always to a product
of positive and negative energy states (so that there is no counterpart of bound state entanglement
and negentropic entanglement possible for zero energy states) U-matrix and can be regarded as a
collection of M-matrices
Um+n−,r+,s−
=
M(m+, n−)r+,s−
(3.6.3)
labeled by the pairs (m+, n−) labelling zero energy states assumed to reduced to pairs of positive
and negative energy states. M-matrix element is the counterpart of S-matrix element Sr,s in positive
energy ontology. Unitarity conditions for U-matrix read as

3.6. Some consequences of NMP
147
(UU †)m+n−,r+s−
=
X
k+,l−
M(m+, n−)k+,l−M(r+, s−)k+,l−= δm+r+,n−s−,
(U †U)m+n−,r+s−
=
X
k+,l−
M(k+, l−)m+,n−M(k+, l−)r+,s−= δm+r+,n−s−.
(3.6.4)
The conditions state that the zero energy states associated with diﬀerent labels are orthogonal as zero
energy states and also that the zero energy states deﬁned by the dual M-matrix
M †(m+, n−)k+,l−≡M(k+l−)m+,n−
(3.6.5)
-perhaps identiﬁable as phase conjugate states- deﬁne an orthonormal basis of zero energy states.
When time-like binding and negentropic entanglementare allowed also zero energy states with a
label not implying a decomposition to a product state are involved with the unitarity condition but
this does not aﬀect the situation dramatically. As a matter fact, the situation is mathematically the
same as for ordinary S-matrix in the presence of bound states.
How quantum computation in zero energy ontology diﬀers from ordinary quantum com-
putation
Quantum computation in zero energy ontology diﬀers in several respects from ordinary quantum
computation.
1. The time parameter deﬁning quantum computation as a unitary time evolution in standard
quantum physics disappears and corresponds to the U-matrix for single quantum jump. Quan-
tum computation corresponds to the U-matrix assignable to single quantum jump if one restricts
to sub-CDs with given time scale inside larger CD. The quantum jump for given sub-CD would
represent single quantum computation and the outcome of the quantum computation would be
determined statistically from the distribution of the outcomes of state function reductions for
over sub-CDs.
Quantum classical correspondence encourages to assign to the quantum computation an interval
of psychological time equal to the proper time distance between the tips of CD. For instance,
.1 seconds would the be time scale assignable to quantum computations possibly assignable to
electrons.
The hierarchies of CDs and Planck constants make possible zoomed up variants of quantum
computations. This kind of zooming might be essential for intelligent behavior since it is useful
to simulate dynamics of the external world in the time scales natural for brain and shorter than
the time scale during which it is necessary to react in order to survive. The geometric duration
of the shortest possible quantum computation with respect to the psychological time of self is
of order CP2 time about 104 Planck times, if the simplest estimate is correct.
2. The classical space-time correlates for the quantum computation are four-dimensional unlike in
the case of ordinary quantum compitation. In living matter nerve pulses and EEG frequencies
would be very natural correlates of this kind.
The model for DNA as topological quantum
computer [K23] has as its space-time correlates magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting DNA nucleotides
and lipids of nuclear and cell membranes deﬁning the braiding coding for the topological quantum
computation. Dynamical ﬂow of lipids deﬁnes the braiding in time direction and the memory
representation is in terms of the braiding of the ﬂux tubes induced by this ﬂow. A good metaphor
is in terms of dancers connected to a wall by threads. Dancing is the correlate for the running
quantum computer program and the geometric entanglement of threads the correlate for the
storage of the program to computer memory.
3. The outcome of quantum computation is described statistically in terms of a large set of quantum
computations. The statistical description of the conscious experience of ensemble of sub-selves
implies that mathematically the situation is very much analogous with that encountered in the

148
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
standard quantum computation and it is attractive to assume that conscious experience codes for
the outcome of quantum computation via the average quantities assignable to the distribution
of zero energy quantum states assignabl to sub-CDs.
4. A further new element is macro-temporal quantum coherence involving several aspects. One of
these aspects is that the time scale of CD deﬁnes macrotemporal quantum coherence at least at
the level of the ﬁeld body assignable to the physical system such as electron. It is not quite clear
whether electrons correspond to distinct overlapping CDs of size scale deﬁned by .1 second time
scale and of the order of Earth circumference and thus satisfying the basic criterion of quantum
coherence or whether one should speak about anyonic many particle states assignable to single
CD or whether both interpretations can make sense depending on situation. In living matter
also millisecond time scale is important and would correspond naturally to the CDs assignable
to u and d quarks in nuclei and perhaps also with the ends of magnetic ﬂux tubes in the model
of DNA as topological quantum computer. In the proposed model quarks and antiquarks at
the ends of ﬂux tubes represent genetic codons and their entangelement is responsible for the
realization of the program at quantum level. The millisecond time scale of synchronous cortical
ﬁring and of nerve pulse could correspond to the time scale of CDs associated with u and d
quarks at the ends of the ﬂux tube. Note that larger value of ℏwould scale up this time scale.
Quantum parallel dissipation taking place at various size scales for CD is a further new element.
5. One must generalize the standard quantum computer paradigm since ordinary quantum com-
puters represent only the lowest, 2-adic level of the p-adic intelligence. Qubits must be replaced
by qupits since for algebraic entanglement two-state systems are naturally replaced with p-state
systems. For primes of order say p ≃2167 (the size of small bacterium) this means about 167
bits, which would mean gigantic quantum computational resources. The secondary p-adic time
scale T2(127) ≃.1 seconds basic bit-like unit corresponds to M127 = 2127−1 M127-qupits making
about 254 bits. The size of neuron corresponds to CD with time scale equal to the age of the
universe and in this case the maximum the number of pinary digits is 171.
The ﬁnite measurement resolution for qubits of course poses strong limitations to the actual
number of bits since the negentropic zero energy qubits must be in reasonable approximation
pure qubits distinguishable from each other and could correspond CDs with time scales coming
as powers of two from n = kmin to k so that the eﬀective number of qubits would go like 2-based
logarithm of the p-adic prime. For instance, electron could correspond to six bits assignable to
genetic code plus parity bit corresponding to time scale range from 1 ms to 100 ms. In any case
the idea about neuron as a classical bit might be completely wrong!
6. Spin glass degeneracy also provides the needed huge number of degrees of freedom making quan-
tum computations very eﬀective. These degrees of freedom are associated with the join along
boundaries bonds -say magnetic ﬂux tubes- and are essentially gravitational so that a connection
with Penrose-Hameroﬀhypothesis suggests itself. The space-time sheets mediating gravitational
interaction are predicted to have a huge gravitational Planck constant ℏgr = GMm/v0, v0/c < 1,
particles at these space-time sheets are predicted to have huge Compton wavelengths and the
plausible looking identiﬁcation is in terms of dark energy [K73, K56] . This would make quantum
computation like activities possible in super-astronomical time scales.
Three kinds of quantum computations are possible in TGD Universe
In TGD Universe one must distinguish between three kinds of quantum computational modes.
Ordinary quantum computation utilizes only the part of U-matrix for which zero energy states
involved are unentangled products of positive and negative energy states. In this case quantum
coherence is extremely fragile and lasts for single quantum jump only but even in this case one
might hope that coherence time correspondences to the time scale CD. U-matrix can calso
correspond to the analogous of bound states for real time-like entanglement. If the proposed
interpretation makes sense these state pairs would not correspond to conscious rules. Negentropic
entanglement in time direction is the third option. For living quantum computers entanglement
could correspond to bound state entangelment or negentropic entanglement and NMP takes
care that the character of both these states is preserved. Thus bio-systems would be especially
attractive candidates for performers of quantum computation like processes.

3.7. Some consequences of NMP
149
Negentropic quantum computations, fuzzy qubits, and quantum groups
1. The possibility of negentropic entanglement is certainly the basic distinction making in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds possible conscious process at least analogous to a quantum
computation and accompanied by a conscious understanding.
What makes this possible is
the fact that the negentropically entangled states of N basic states have permutation of the
basis states as a symmetry.
For instance, states for which bit 1 appears with almost unit
probability gives by permutation a state for which bit 0 appears with almost unit probability.
This suggests that the outcome of quantum computation is expressed in terms of almost bits with
a small mixing implying that the outcome has interpretation both as a rule and as almost bit in
the ordinary sense. The conscious quantum computation would utilize states with negentropic
entanglement in time direction. Also the analogies of bound states for time-like engtanglement
are possible and might make possible the counterpart of ordinary quantum computation without
the higher level conscious experience about rules deﬁned by the entangled states.
2. Negentropic entanglement for positive and negative energy parts of bits stable and pinary digits
stable under NMP means that the logic is always fuzzy. I have proposed the mathematical
description of this in terms of quantum spinors for which the components do not commute
anymore implying that only the probability for either spin state is is an observable [K92] .
This suggests that negentropic entanglement might be describable in terms of quantum spinors
and that it would be the unavoidable fuzziness which would make possible the representation
conscious rules. What is interesting that for quantum spinors the spectrum of the probabilities
for given spin is universal and depends only on the integers characterizing the quantum phase
q = exp(i2π/n). An alternative interpretation is that fuzzy logic relates to a ﬁnite measurement
resolution. These interpretation need not be in conﬂict with each other. Since quantum groups
are associated with anyonic systems, this suggests that negentropic quantum computations take
place in anyonic systems assignable to phases with large value of ℏ. This encourages to consider
the possibility that quantum phases deﬁne algebraic extensions of p-adic numbers.
3. In living systems it might be more appropriate to talk about conscious problem solving instead
of quantum computation. In this framework the periods of macro-temporal quantum coher-
ence replace the unitary time evolutions at the gates of the quantum computer as the basic
information processing units and entanglement bridges between selves act as basic quantum
communication units with the sharing of mental images providing a communication mode not
possible in standard quantum mechanics.
3.7
Some consequences of NMP
In the sequel the most obvious consequences of self measurement and NMP are discussed from the
point of view of physics, biology, cognition, and quantum computing. The recent discussion diﬀers
considerably from the earlier one since several new elements are involved. Zero energy ontology and the
hierarchy of CDs, the hierarchy of Planck constants and dark matter, and -perhaps most importantly-
the better understanding negentropic entanglement as something genuinely new and making sense in
the interection of real and various p-adic worlds at which living matter is assumed to reside.
3.7.1
NMP and thermodynamics
The physical status of the second law has been a longstanding open issue in physics- in particular
biophysics.
In positive energy ontology the understanding of the origin of second law is simple.
Quantum jumps involve state function reduction (or more generally, self measurement) with a random
outcome and in the case of ensemble of identical system this leads to to a probability distribution for
the states of the members of the ensemble. This implies Boltzmann equations implying the second
law. In TGD framework there are many elements which force to question this simple picture: zero
energy ontology and CDs, eﬀective four-dimensionality of the ensemble deﬁned by states assignable
to sub-CDs, hierarchy of Planck constants, and the possibility of negentropic entanglement.

150
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Zero energy ontology and thermodynamical ensembles
Zero energy ontology means that the thermodynamics appears both at the level of quantum states
and at the level of ensembles. At the level of quantum states this means that M-matrix can be seen
as a complex square root of the density matrix: ρ = MM †, where M is expressible as a product
of a positive and diagonal square root of density matrix and unitary S-matrix identiﬁable as the
S-matrix used in quantum physics. U matrix can be seen as a collection of M-matrices as will be
found later so that U-matrix ﬁxes M-matrices contrary to what was believed originally. One can say
that thermodynamics -at least in some sense- is represented at the level of single particle states. It is
natural to assume that this density matrix is measured in particle physics experiment, and that this
measurement corresponds to a state function reduction, which in standard physics picture corresponds
to a preparation for the initial states and state function reduction for the ﬁnal states.
The p-adic thermodynamics, which applies to conformal weights rather than energy, predicts
successfully elementary particle masses [K48] and should reduce to this thermodynamics. That p-adic
thermodynamics can be applied at all suggests that even elementary particles reside in the intersection
of the real and p-adic worlds so that either p-adic thermodynamics or real thermodynamics with
additional constraints on temperature implied by number theory applies.
Thermodynamical ensembles are 4-dimensional
The hierarchy of CDs within CDs deﬁnes a hierarchy of sub-systems and sub-CDs deﬁne in a natural
manner 4-dimensional ensemble.
If the state function reduction leads to unentangled states, the
outcome is an ensemble describable by the density matrix assignable to the single particle states. The
sequence of quantum jumps is expected to lead to a 4-D counterpart of thermodynamical ensemble and
thermodynamics results when one labels the states by the quantum numbers assignable to their positive
energy part. Entropy is assigned with entire 4-D CD rather than to its 3-dimensional time=constant
snapshots.
The thermodynamical time is basically the subjective time and measured in terms of
quantum jumps but has a correlation with geometric time as explained in [K3] and explained brieﬂy
below.
This picture diﬀers from the standard views, and this might explain the paradoxical situation in
cosmology resulting from the fact that the initial state of the universe in the standard sense of the
word looks highly entropic whereas second law would suggest the opposite [K74] . The cosmological
entropy is assigned with a CD of size scale deﬁned by the value of the age of the universe. In this
kind of situation each quantum jump replaces the zero energy state with a new one and also induces a
drift in the space of CDs to the direction of larger CDs with size deﬁned by the proper time distance
between the tips of CD coming as power of 2. Entropy as a function of cosmic time corresponds in
TGD framework to the increase of the 4-D entropy as a function of the quantized proper time distance
between the tips of the CD.
In this framework it is possible to understand second law in cosmic time scales apart from the
possible eﬀects related to the negentropic entanglement responsible for the evolution and breaking of
second law in arbitrarily long time scales. For instance, the number of sub-CDs increases meaning
the increase of the size of the ensemble and the emergence of new p-adic length scales as the size of
cosmic CD increases. What is fascinating is that the TGD counterpart of cosmic time is quantized
in powers of two. This might have predictable eﬀects such as the occurrence of the cosmic expansion
in a jump-wise manner. I have discussed an explanation of the accelerated cosmic expansion in terms
of quantum jumps of this kind but starting from somewhat diﬀerent picture [K74] .
How second law must be modiﬁed?
Second law as such does not certainly apply in TGD framework.
1. The hierarchy of CDs forces to introduce a fractal version of the second law taking into account
the p-adic length scale hypothesis and dark matter hierarchy. This means that the idea about
quantum parallel Universes generalizes to that of quantum parallel dissipating Universes. For
instance, the parton model of hadrons based on quarks and gluons relies on kinetic equations and
is basically thermodynamical whereas the model for hadron applied at low energies is quantum
mechanical. These two views are consistent if quantum parallel dissipation realized in terms of a
hierarchy of CDs is accepted. p-Adic length scale hierarchy with p-adic length scale hypothesis

3.7. Some consequences of NMP
151
stating that primes near powers of two are preferred corresponds to this dissipative quantum
parallellism. Dark matter hierarchy brings in a further dissipative quantum parallelism.
2. Second law should always be applied only at a given level of p-adic and dark matter hierarchy
and one must always take into account two time scales involved corresponding to the time scale
assignable to the system identiﬁable as the time scale characterizing corresponding CD and the
time scale in which the system is observed. Only if the latter time scale is considerably longer
than the CD time scale, second law is expected to make sense in TGD framework -this provided
one restricts the consideration to the entropic entanglement. The reason is that the Boltzmann
equations implying the second law require that the geometric time scale assignable to quantum
jump is considerably shorter than the time scale of observation: this guarantees that the random
nature of quantum jump allows to use statistical approach.
3. The possibility of negentropic entanglement in time scale of CD brings a further new element
strongly suggesting that the mechanical application of second law does to living matter does not
make sense. The basic time scales for CDs come as powers of two and the hierarchy of Planck
constants in the most general case allows rational multiples of these. If a restriction is made
to singular covering spaces of CD and CP2 (this might well be consistent with experimental
inputs), only integer multiples of these time scales are predicted at the level of dark matter. The
increase of Planck constant allows to scale up the time scale of quantum coherence associated
with the negentropic entanglement and this provides a further good reason for why large values
of Planck constant should be favored in living matter.
4. The reduction of entanglement entropy at single particle level implies the increase of thermo-
dynamical entropy at the level of ensemble in the case of entropic non-binding entanglement.
This applies also to bound state entanglement leading to a generation of entropy at the level of
binding systems and a reduction of the contribution of the bound systems to the entropy of the
entire system. Note however the emission of binding energy -say in form of photons- could take
care of the compensation so that entropy would be never reduced for ensemble. In the case of
negentropic entanglement the situation is diﬀerent.
The entropy of the negentropically entangled system is negative and the synenergic aspect of
negentropic entanglement means that the system does not contribute to thermodynamical en-
tropy. This means that second law could be broken in the geometric time scale considered. One
must of course be careful in distinguishing between geometric and subjective time. In the case
of subjective time the negentropic situation could continue forever unless the CD disappears in
some quantum jump (highly non-probable for large enough CDs). If not, then endless evolution
at the level of conscious experience is possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and
heat death is not the fate of the Universe as in ordinary thermodynamics.
5. The breaking of second law must correspond to the breaking of ergodicity. Spin glasses are non-
ergodic systems and TGD Universe is analogous to a 4-D quantum spin glass by the failure of
strict non-determinism of K¨ahler action reﬂecting itself as vacuum degeneracy. Does the quan-
tum spin glass property of the TGD universe imply the breaking of the second law? Gravitation
has been seen as one possible candidate for the breaking second law because of its long range
nature. It is indeed classical gravitational energy which distinguishes between almost degenerate
spin glass states. The huge value of gravitational Planck constant associated with space-time
sheets mediating gravitational interaction and making possible perturbative quantum treatment
of gravitational interaction would indeed suggest the breaking of second law in cosmological time
scales. For instance, black hole entropy which is inversely proportional to GM 2/ℏgr would be
for the values of gravitational Planck constant involved of the order of unity.
What do experiments say about second law?
That the status of the second law is far from settled is demonstrated by an experiment performed by
a research group in Australian National University [D4] . The group studied a system consisting of
100 small beads in water. One bead was shot by a laser beam so that it became charged and was
trapped. The container holding the beads was then moved from side to side 1000 times per second
so that the trapped bead dragged ﬁrst one way and then another. The system was monitored and

152
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
for monitoring times not longer than .1 seconds second law did not hold always: entropy could also
decrease.
1. What is remarkable that .1 seconds deﬁnes the duration τ of the memetic code word and cor-
responds to the secondary p-adic time scale Tp(2) = √pLp/c associated with Mersenne prime
p = M127 characterizing electron. This correspondence follows solely from the model of genetic
code predicting hierarchy of codes associated with p = 3, 7, 127 (genetic code), p = M127,... τ
should be the fundamental time scale of consciousness. For instance, average alpha frequency
10 Hz corresponds to this time scale and ’features’ inside cortex representing sensory percepts
have average duration of .1 seconds.
For electrons the CDs would have spatial size L = 3×107 meters, which is slightly smaller than
the circumference of Earth (L = cT, T = .1 s, the duration of sensory moment) so that they
would have a strong overlap. One can of course ask whether this is an accident. For instance,
the lowest Schumann frequency is around 7.8 Hz and not far from 10 Hz. What is interesting
that Bohr orbit model [K73] predicts that Universe might be populated by Earth like systems
having same distance from their Sun (stars with mass near that of Sun are very frequent). Bohr
orbitology applied to Earth itself could also lead to the quantization of the radius of Earth.
2. The ﬁrst observation was made for more than 15 years ago. Even more remarkable is the recent
observation that the time scale of CD associated with electron is .1 seconds. Can one assign the
breaking of the second law with the ﬁeld bodies of electrons?
3. The experiment involves also a millisecond time scale. I do not know whether it is essential that
the time scale is just this but one can play with the though that it is. Millisecond time scale is
roughly the duration of seventh bit of the genetic codeword if its bits correspond to CDs with
sizes coming as subsequence octaves of the basic time scale. Millisecond deﬁnes also the time
scale for the duration of the nerve pulse and the frequency of kHz cortical synchrony.
At the level of CDs millisecond time scale would correspond to a secondary p-adic time scale
assignable to k = 120. Only u and d quarks, which appear with several p-adic mass scales
in hadron physics and are predicted to be present as light variants also in nuclear physics as
predicted by TGD, could correspond to this p-adic length scale: the prediction for their mass
scale would be 5 MeV. Does this mean that the basic time scales of living matter correspond
directly to the basic time scales of elementary particle physics?
4. A further interesting point is that neutrinos correspond to .1 eV mass scale. This means that
the p-adic length scale is around k = 167 which means that the corresponding CD has time
scale which is roughly 240 times that for electron and corresponds to the primary p-adic length
scale of 2.5 µm (size of cellular nucleus) and tothe time scale of 104 years. I have proposed
that so called cognitive neutrino pairs consisting of neutrino and antineutrino assignable to
the opposite throats of wormhole contact could play key a role in the formation of cognitive
representations [K61] . This assumption looks now un-necessarily restrictive but one could quite
well consider the possibility that neutrinos are responsible for the longest time scales assignable
to consciousness for ordinary value of ℏ(not necessarily our consciousness!). Large value of ℏ
could make also possible the situation in which intermediate gauge bosons are eﬀectively massless
in cell length scale so that electro-weak symmetry breaking would be absent. This would require
ℏ≃233. For this value of ℏthe time scale of electronic CD is of the order of the duration of
human of human life cycle. This would scale up the Compton length of neutrino to about 10
kilometers and the temporal size of neutrino CD to a super-cosmological time scale.

NMP and self-organization
NMP leads to new vision about self-organization about which adetailed vision is discussed in [K69] .
Here only some key points are emphasized.
1. Dissipation selects the asymptotic self-organization patterns in the standard theory of self-
organization and the outcomes are interesting in the presence of energy feed. The feed of energy
can be generalized to feed of any kind of quantum numbers: for instance, feed of quantum num-
bers characterizing qualia. In fact, energy increment in quantum jump deﬁnes one particular
kind of quale [K28] .

2. The notion of self relates very closely to self-organization in TGD framework [K69] . Self is a
dissipative structure because it has subselves which dissipate quantum parallely with it. Self as
a perceiver maps the dissipation at the level of quantities in the external world to dissipation at
the level of qualia in the internal world.
3. Dissipation leads to self-organization patterns and in the absence of external energy feed to
thermal equilibrium. Thus thermodynamics emerges as a description for an ensemble of selves
or for the time average behavior or single self when external energy feed to system is absent. One
can also understand how the dissipative universe characterized by the presence of parameters
like diﬀusion constants, conductivities, viscosities, etc.. in the otherwise reversible equations of
motion, emerges. Dissipative dynamics is in a well deﬁned sense the envelope for the sequence of
reversible dynamical evolutions modelling the sequence of ﬁnal state quantum histories deﬁned
by quantum jumps.
4. Quantum self-organization can be seen as iteration of the unitary process followed by state
function reduction and leads to ﬁxed point self-organization patterns analogous to the patterns
emerging in Benard ﬂow. Since selves approach ’asymptotic selves’, dissipation can be regarded
as a Darwinian selector of both genes and memes. Thus not only surviving physical systems
but also stable conscious experiences of selves, habits, skills, behaviors, etc... are a result of
Darwinian selection.
5. In TGD one must distinguish between two kinds of self organizations corresponding to the
entropic bound state entanglement and negentropic entanglement. Biological self-organization
could be therefore fundamentally diﬀerent from the non-biological one. The succes of the p-adic
mass calculations suggest that even elementary particles live in the intersection of real and p-
adic worlds so that one should be very cautious in making strong conclusions. Certainly the
intentional, goal-directed behavior of the system in some time scale is a signature of negentropic
self-organization but it is diﬃcult to apply this criterion in time scales vastly diﬀerent from
human time scales. It is the ﬁeld bodies (or magnetic bodies) , which can be assigned naturally
to CDs which suggests that the negentropic self organization occurs at this level. TGD based
vision about living matter actually assumes this implicitly.
6. What is new that even quantum jump itself can be seen as a self-organization process analogous
to Darwinian selection, which eliminates all unbound entanglement and yields a state containing
only bound state state entanglement or negentropic entanglement and representing analog of the
self-organization patterns. By macro-temporal quantum coherence eﬀectively gluing quantum
jumps sequences to single quantum jump this pattern replicates itself fractally in various time
scales. Thus self-organization patterns can be identiﬁed as bound states and states paired by
a negentropic entanglement and the development of the self-organization pattern as a fractally
scaled up version of single quantum jump. Second new element is that dissipation is not mere
destruction of order but producer of jewels. A further new element is that dissipation can occur
in quantum parallel manner in various scales.
7. The failure of the determinism in standard sense for K¨ahler action is consistent with the clas-
sical description of dissipation. In particular, the emergence of sub-selves inside self looks like
dissipation from outside but corresponds to self-organization from the point of view of self. 4-
dimensional spin glass degeneracy meaning breaking of ergodicity crucial for self-organization is
highly suggestive on basis of the vacuum degeneracy of K¨ahler action, and this alone predicts
ultrametric topology for the landscape of the maxima of K¨ahler function deﬁned in terms of
K¨ahler action so that p-adicity emerges naturally also in this manner.
One particularly interesting concrete prediction is that the time scales assignable to CDs come
as powers of two. This predicts fundamental frequencies coming as powers of two, and the hierarchy
of Planck constants predicts rational or at least integer multiples of these frequencies. Could these
powers of two relate to frequency doubling rather generally observed in hydrodynamical self-organizing
systems?

NMP and p-adic length scale hypothesis
The original form of the p-adic length scale hypothesis stated that physically most interesting p-adic
primes satisfy p ≃2k , k prime or power of prime. It has however turned out that all positive integers
k are possible. Surprisingly few new length scales are predicted by this generalization in physically
interesting length scales. p-Adic length scale hypothesis leads to excellent predictions for elementary
particle masses (note that the mass prediction is exponentially sensitive to the value of k) and explains
also some interesting length scales of biology: for instance, the thicknesses of the cell membrane and
of single lipid layer of cell membrane correspond to k = 151 and k = 149 respectively.
The big problem of p-adic TGD is to derive this hypothesis from the basic structure of the theory.
1. One argument is based on black hole-elementary particle analogy [K53] leading to the general-
ization of the Hawking-Bekenstein formula: the requirement leading to the p-adic length scale
hypothesis is that the radius of the so called elementary particle horizon is itself a p-adic length
scale. This argument involves p-adic entropy essentially and it seems that information processing
is somehow involved.
2. Zero energy ontology predicts p-adic length scale hypothesis if one accepts the assumption that
the proper time distances between the tips of CDs come as powers of 2 [K53] . A more general
highly suggestive proposal is that the relative position between tips forms a lattice at proper
time constant hyperboloid having as a symmetry group discrete subgroup of Lorentz group
(which could reduce to a subgroup of the group SO(3) acting as isotropy group for the time-like
direction deﬁned by the relative coordinate between the tips of CD [K74] .
p-Adic length scale hypothesis could be understood as a resonance in frequency domain -most
naturally for massless particles like photons. The secondary p-adic time scale for favored p-adic
primes must be as near as possible to the proper time distance between the tips of CD. Mersenne
primes Mn = 2n −1 (n is prime) satisfy this condition. Also log(p) is in this case as near as
possible to log(2n) and in the sense that the unit of negentropy deﬁned as log(2n−m(n))/log(2n)
is maximized. This argument might work also for Gaussian Mersennes Gn = (1 + i)n −1 (n is
prime also now) if one restricts the consideration to Gaussian primes.
A more general and more realistic looking hypothesis is that a given CD can have partonic light-
like 3-surfaces ending at its boundaries for all p-adic length scales up to that associated with
CD: powers of 2 would be favored by the condition of commeasurability very much analogous
to frequency doubling.
3. An exciting possibility, suggested already earlier half seriously, is that evolution is present already
at elementary particle level. This is the case if elementary particles reside in the intersection
of real and p-adic worlds.
The success of p-adic mass calculations and the identiﬁcation of
p-adic physics as physics of cognition indeed forces this interpretation. In particular, one can
understand p-adic length scale hypothesis as reﬂecting the survival of the cognitively ﬁttest
p-adic topologies.
I have discussed also other explanations.
1. A possible physical reason for the primes near prime powers of 2 is that survival necessitates
the ability to co-operate, to act in resonance: this requirement might force commeasurability
of the length scales for p-adic space-time sheet (p1) glued to larger space-time sheet (p2 > p1).
The hierarchy would state from 2-adic level having characteristic fractal length scales coming as
powers of
√
2. When p > 2 space-time sheet is generated during cosmological evolution L(p) for
it must correspond to power of
√
2 so that one must have p ≃2n.
2. A model for learning [K14] as a transformation of the reﬂective level of consciousness to proto
level supports the view that evolution and learning occur already at elementary particle level
as indeed suggested by NMP: the p-adic primes near power of prime powers of two are the
ﬁttest ones. The core of the argument is the characterization of learning as a map from 2N
many-fermion states to M association sequences. The number of association sequences should
be as near as possible equal to 2N. If M is power of prime: M = pK, association sequences
can be given formally the structure of a ﬁnite ﬁeld G(p, K) and p-adic length scale hypothesis

3.7. Some consequences of NMP

follows as a consequence of K = 1. NMP provides the reason for why M = pK is favored: in
this case one can construct realization of quantum computer with entanglement probabilities
pk = 1/M = 1/pK and the negentropy gain in quantum jump is Klog(p) while for M not
divisible by p the negentropy gain is zero.
3.7.4
NMP and biology
The notion of self is crucial for the understanding of bio-systems and consciousness. It seems that
the negentropic entanglement is the decisive element of life and that one can say that in metaphoral
sense life resides in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
Life as islands of rational/algebraic numbers in the seas of real and p-adic continua?
Rational and even algebraic entanglement coeﬃcients make sense in the intersection of real and p-adic
words, which suggests that life and conscious intelligence reside in the intersection of the real and
p-adic worlds. This would mean that the mathematical expressions for the space-time surfaces (or
at least 3-surfaces or partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D tangent planes) make sense in both real and
p-adic sense for some primes p. Same would apply to the expressions deﬁning quantum states. In
particular, entanglement probabilities would be rationals or algebraic numbers so that entanglement
can be negentropic and the formation of bound states in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds
generates information and is thus favored by NMP.
The identiﬁcation of intentionality as the basic aspect of life seems to be consistent with this idea.
1. The proposed realization of the intentional action has been as a transformation of p-adic space-
time sheet to a real one. Also transformations of real space-time sheets to p-adic space-time
sheets identiﬁable as cognitions are possible. Algebraic entanglement is a prerequisite for the
realization of intentions in this manner. Essentially a leakage between p-adic and real worlds is
in question and makes sense only in zero energy ontology. The reason is that various quantum
numbers in real and p-adic sectors are not in general comparable in positive energy ontology so
that conservation laws would be broken or even cease to make sense.
2. The transformation of intention to action can occur if the partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D
tangent space-distributions are representable using rational functions with rational (or even
algebraic) coeﬃcients in preferred coordinates for the imbedding space dictated by symmetry
considerations. Intentional systems must live in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
3. For the minimal option life would be also eﬀectively 2-dimensional phenomenon and essentially a
boundary phenomenon as also number theoretical criticality suggests. There are good reasons to
expect that only the data from the intersection of real and p-adic partonic two-surfaces appears
in U-matrix so that only the data from rational and some algebraic points of the partonic 2-
surface dictate U-matrix. This means discretization at parton level and something which might
be called number theoretic quantum ﬁeld theory should emerge as a description of intentional
action.
A good guess is that algebraic entanglement is essential for quantum computation, which therefore
might correspond to a conscious process. Hence cognition could be seen as a quantum computation
like process, a more approriate term being quantum problem solving [K23] . Living-dead dichotomy
could correspond to rational-irrational or to algebraic-transcendental dichotomy: this at least when
life is interpreted as intelligent life. Life would in a well deﬁned sense correspond to islands of rational-
ity/algebraicity in the seas of real and p-adic continua. Life as a critical phenomenon in the number
theoretical sense would be one aspect of quantum crticality of TGD Universe besides the criticality
of the space-time dynamics and the criticality with respect to phase transitions changing the value of
Planck constant and other more familiar criticalities. How closely these criticalities relate remains an
open question [K69] .
The view about the crucial role of rational and algebraic numbers as far as intelligent life is
considered, could have been guessed on very general grounds from the analogy with the orbits of a
dynamical system. Rational numbers allow a predictable periodic decimal/pinary expansion and are
analogous to one-dimensional periodic orbits. Algebraic numbers are related to rationals by a ﬁnite

156
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
number of algebraic operations and are intermediate between periodic and chaotic orbits allowing an
interpretation as an element in an algebraic extension of any p-adic number ﬁeld. The projections of
the orbit to various coordinate directions of the algebraic extension represent now periodic orbits. The
decimal/pinary expansions of transcendentals are un-predictable being analogous to chaotic orbits.
The special role of rational and algebraic numbers was realized already by Pythagoras, and the fact
that the ratios for the frequencies of the musical scale are rationals supports the special nature of
rational and algebraic numbers. The special nature of the Golden Mean, which involves
√
5, conforms
the view that algebraic numbers rather than only rationals are essential for life.
That only algebraic extensions are possible is of course only a working hypothesis. Also ﬁnite-
dimensional extensions of p-adic numbers involving transcendentals are possible and might in fact be
necessary. Consider for instance the extension containing e, e2, .., ep−1 as units (ep is ordinary p-adic
number. Inﬁnite number of analogous ﬁnite-dimensional extensions can be constructed by taking a
function of integer variable such that f(p) exists both p-adically and as a real transcendental number.
The powers of f(p)1/n for a ﬁxed value of n deﬁne a ﬁnite-dimensional transcendental extension of
p-adic numbers if the roots do not exist p-adically.
Numbers like log(p) and π cannot belong to a ﬁnite-dimensional extension of p-adic numbers [K27]
. One cannot of course take any strong attitude concerning the possibility of inﬁnite-dimensional ex-
tensions of p-adic numbers but the working hypothesis has been that they are absent. The phases
exp(i2π/n) deﬁne ﬁnite dimensional extensions allowing to replace the notion of angle in ﬁnite mea-
surement resolution with the corresponding phase factors in ﬁnite measurement.
The functions
exp(i2πq/n), where q is arbitrary p-adic integers deﬁne in a natural manner the physical counter-
parts of plane waves and angular momentum eigenstates not allowing an identiﬁcation as ordinary
p-adic exponential functions. They are clearly strictily periodic functions of q with a ﬁnite value set.
If n is divisible by a power of p, these functions are continuous since the values of the function for q
and q + kpn are identical for large enough values of n. This condition is essential and means in the
case of plane waves that the size scale of a system (say one-dimensional box) is multiple of a power of
p.
Evolution and second law
Evolution has many facets in TGD framework.
1. A natural characterization of evolution is in terms of p-adic topology relating naturally to cog-
nition. p-Adic primes near powers of two are favored if CDs have the proposed discrete size
spectrum. From the point of view of self this would be essentially cosmic expansion in discrete
jumps. CDs and can be characterized by powers of 2 and if partonic 2-surfaces correspond to ef-
fective p-adic p-adic topology characterized by a power of two, one obtains the commeasurability
of the secondary p-adic time scale of particle and that of CD in good approximation.
2. The notion of inﬁnite primes motivates the hypothesis that the many-sheeted structure of space-
time can be coded by inﬁnite primes [K78] . The number of primes larger than given inﬁnite
prime P is inﬁnitely larger than the number of primes than P. The inﬁnite prime P characteriz-
ing the entire universe decomposes in a well deﬁned manner to ﬁnite primes and p-adic evolution
at the level of entire universe is implied by local p-adic evolution at the level of selves. Therefore
maximum entanglement negentropy gain for p-adic self increases at least as log(p) with p in the
long run. This kind of relationship might hold true for real selves of p-adic physics is physics of
cognitive representations of real physics as suggested by the success of p-adic mass calculations.
Thus it should be possible to assign deﬁnite p-adic prime to each partonic 2-surface.
3. A further aspect of evolution relates to the hierarchy of Planck constants implying that at dark
matter levels rational or at least integer multiples of the favored p-adic time scales are realized.
The latter option is favored by the idea that the book like structure with pages consisting
of many-sheeted coverings of CD and CP2, and correlates with the emergence of algebraic
extensions of p-adic numbers deﬁned by the roots exp(i2π/n) of unity. For the latter option
evolution by quantum jumps would automatically imply the drifting of the partonic 2-surfaces
to the pages of books labelled by increasing values of Planck constant. For more general option
one might argue that drifting to pages with small values of Planck constant is also possible. This
would give kind of antizooms of long length scale physics to short scales. Both kind of temporal

3.7. Some consequences of NMP
157
zooms could be crucial for conscious intelligence building scaled models about time evolution in
various scales.
4. The generation of negentropic entanglement between diﬀerent number ﬁelds would of course be
the fundamental aspect of evolution. It would give rise to increasingly complex and negentropic
sensory perceptions and cognitive representations based on conscious rules coded by negentropic
entanglement. This would justify the association concept as it used in neuro-science. Negentropic
entanglement could be also crucial for the basic mechanism of metabolism and make possible
conscious co-operation even in nano-scales.
Just for fun one can play also with numbers.
1. The highest dark matter level associated with self corresponds to its geometric duration which
can be arbitrarily long: the typical duration of the memory span gives an idea about the level
of dark matter hierarchy involved if one assumes that the time scale .1 seconds assignable to
electrons is the fundamental time scale. If the time scale T of human life cycle corresponds to a
secondary p-adic time scale then T = 100 years gives the rough estimate r ≡ℏ/ℏ0 = 233 if this
time scale corresponds to that for dark electron. The corresponding primary p-adic time length
scale corresponds to k = 160 and is 2.2 × 10−7 meters.
2. If human time scale -taken to be T = 100 years- corresponds to primary p-adic time scale of
electron, one must have roughly r = 297.
I have already discussed the second law in TGD framework and it seems that its applies only when
the time scale of perception is longer than the time scale characterizing the level of the p-adic and
dark matter hierarchy. Second law as it is usually stated can be seen as an unavoidable implication
of the materialistic ontology.
Stable entanglement and quantum metabolism as diﬀerent sides of the same coin
The notion of binding has two meanings. Binding as a formation of bound state and binding as a
fusion of mental images to larger ones essential for the functioning of brain and regarded as one the
big problems of consciousness theory.
Only bound state entanglement and negentropic entanglement are stable against the state reduc-
tion process. Hence the fusion of the mental images implies the formation of a bound entropic state-
in this case the two interpretations of binding are equivalent- or a negentropic state, which need not
be bound state.
1. In the case of negentropic entanglement bound state need not be formed and the interesting
possibility is that the negentropic entanglement could give rise to stable states without binding
energy. This could allow to understand the mysterious high energy phosphate bond to which
metabolic energy is assigned in ATP molecule containing three phosphates and liberated as
ATP decays to ADP and phosphate molecule. Negentropic entanglement could also explain the
stability of DNA and other highly charged biopolymers. In this framework the liberation of
metabolic (negentropic) energy would involve dropping of electrons to a larger space-time sheets
accompanying the process ATP →ADP + Pi. A detailed model of this process is discussed
in [K26] .
2. The formation of bound state entanglement is expected to involve a liberation of the binding
energy and this energy might be a usable energy.
This process could perhaps be coined as
quantum metabolism and one could say that quantum metabolism and formation of bound
states are diﬀerent sides of the same coin. It is known that an intense neural activity, although
it is accompanied by an enhanced blood ﬂow to the region surrounding the neural activity,
does not involve an enhanced oxidative metabolism [J45] (that is ATP →ADP process and
its reversal). A possible explanation is that quantum metabolism accompanying the binding is
involved. Note that the bound state is sooner or later destroyed by the thermal noise so that
this mechanism would in a rather clever manner utilize thermal energy by applying what might
be called buy now–pay later principle.
If these interpretations are correct, there would be two modes of metabolism corresponding to two
diﬀerent kinds of fusion of mental images.

3.7.5
NMP, consciousness, and cognition
As already found NMP dictates the subjective time development of self and is therefore the basic law
of consciousness. If p-adic physics is the physics of cognition, the most exotic implications of NMP
relate to cognition rather than standard physics.
Thermodynamics for qualia
If only entropic entanglement is assumed, second law seems to hold also at the level of conscious experi-
ence of self, which can be seen as an ensemble of its subselves assignable to sub-CDs. The randomness
of the state function reduction process implies that conscious experience involves statistical aspects in
the sense that the experienced qualia correspond to the averages of quantum number and zero mode
increments over the sub-selves assignable to sub-CDs. When the number of quantum jumps in the
ensemble deﬁning self increases, qualia get more entropic and fuzzy unless macro-temporal quantum
coherence changes the situation.
Negentropic entanglement means departure from this picture if sub-CDs can generate negentropic
entanglement. This is expected to be true if they overlap if one believes on standard argument for the
formation of macroscopic quantum phases. In this case the ﬂux tubes connecting space-time sheets
assignable to the sub-CDs would serve as a space-time correlate for the negentropic entanglement.
The basic questions are whether sensory qualia can really correspond to the increments of quantum
numbers in quantum jump and whether these quantum jumps are assignable to entropic or negentropic
qualia. What is clear that the sensory qualia such as colors are assigned to an object of external world
rather predictably. This is not obvious if this process is based on quantum jump.
1. Qualia are determined basically as increments of quantum numbers [K28] whereas in ordinary
statistical physics measured quantities would correspond to quantum numbers basically. The
basic function of sensory organs is to map quantum numbers to quantum number increments so
that our sensory perception is in reasonable approximation about world rather than changes of
the world.
2. In zero energy ontology the increments must correspond to increments of quantum numbers for
(say) positive energy part of the state. A sensation of (say) given color requires a continual
feed of corresponding quantum number increment to the positive energy part of the system.
Some kind of far from equilibrium thermodynamics seems to be necessary with external feed of
quantum numbers generalizing the external feed of energy. The capacitor model of a sensory
receptor [K28] realizes this idea in terms of generalized di-electric breakdown implying opposite
charging of the capacitor plates in question. Note that in zero energy ontology also the positive
and negative energy parts of the zero energy state assignable to capacitor plates would be also
analogous to a pair of oppositely charged capacitor plates and one can speak about capacitor
also in time direction.
3. If entropic entanglement is reduced to zero in quantum jump for individual sensory recepto, the
outcome involves all possible values of quale, say diﬀerent fundamental colors for which I have
proposed a model in terms of QCD color [K28] . If the probability of particular value of quale
is much larger than others, one can have statistical ensemble giving rise to predictable quale as
ensemble average.
4. If negentropic entanglement is in question, similar situation is encountered but the perception is
a mixture of qualia. For large values of p-adic prime one could have almost complete dominance
of a particular instance of quale also now. One could argue that the perception represents also
the deﬁnition of the concept of a particular quale as a superposition of pairs of consisting of the
state inducing the instance of the quale and the state representing it. The fact that there are
very many negentropic superpositions however suggests that the superposition represents both
the deﬁnition of quale and average value of quale. For instance, the fusion of various colors could
rely on negentropic entanglement.
5. Both these representations of qualia could realized and one can ask whether the entropic repre-
sentation could be aesthetically less pleasing than the negentropic representation involving also
the notion of quale.

3.7. Some consequences of NMP
159
Questions about various kinds of entropies
There are three kinds of entropies and the basic question is how these entropies relate.
1. Does the entropy characterizing the experience of self relate to the thermodynamical entropy
of some system? The fact that non-geometric sensory qualia have a statistical interpretation,
suggests that the entropy associated with the qualia of the mental image corresponds to the
thermodynamical entropy for a system giving rise to the qualia via the sensory mapping. The
thermodynamics of quantities in the external world would thus be mapped to the thermody-
namics of qualia, increments of quantities, in the inner world. Selves could also represent the
fundamental thermodynamical ensembles since they deﬁne also statistical averages of quantum
numbers and zero modes although these are not directly experienced.
2. Could one interpret the entropies of the space-time sheets as entropies associated with the
symbolic representations of conscious experiences of selves? Could one see the entire classical
reality as a symbolic representation? Does the entropy of conscious experience correspond to
the thermodynamical entropy of the perceived system, which in turn would correspond to the
classical space-time entropy of the system representing the perceived system symbolically? Does
this conclusion generalize to the case of p-adic entropy?
Quantum-classical correspondence
would encourage to cautiously think that the common answer to these questions might be yes.
The arrow of psychological time and second law
The arrow of psychological time is closely related to the second law and I have considered several
alternative identiﬁcations for the arrow of psychological time.
These identiﬁcations are discussed
in [K86, K3, K87] . The latest option favored by zero energy ontology is discussed in [K3] and involves
two aspects: the one related to the arrow of time coordinate assignable to the space-time sheet and
the other one to the relative proper time coordinate between the tips of CD.
A simple argument show that this distance quantized in powers of 2 should increase gradually
in statistical sense since the size of CD can also change in quantum jump. This would have have
interpretation in terms of a ﬂow of ”cosmic time” (CD is analogous to big bang followed by big
crunch).
Interestingly, CD with time scale of order 1011 years (age of the universe) corresponds
primary p-adic length scale of only only 10−4 meters, the size of a large neuron, and also the length
scale in which the blob of water has Planck mass so that the quantization of gravitational Planck
constant should become important [K73] . Could this mean that the CDs assignable to large neurons
make possible to develop the idea about the cosmology and cosmology itself? Could it really be that
that our cognitive representations about Universe quite concretely have the size of the Universe itself
as p-adic view about cognition requires?
Quantum jump and cognition
The fusion of subselves can take place in two manners: by real bound state entanglement and by
negentropic entanglement. The resulting mental images must diﬀer somehow, and the proposal is that
the entanglement associated with the negentropic mental deﬁnes a conscious cognitive representation:
kind of rule. Schr¨odinger cat negentropically entangled with the bottle of poison knows that it is not a
good idea to open the bottle: open bottle-dead cat, closed bottle-living cat. Negentropic entanglement
would generate rules and counterparts of conscious associations fundamental in brain functioning. For
the mental image associated with bound state entanglement the information about bound systems
would be lost. Bound state entanglement could however give rise to stereo-consciousness essential for
(say) stereo vision.
One can imagine several kinds of negentropic entanglements of this kind. Between two real systems,
between real and p-adic systems, and between two p-adic systems possibly characterized by diﬀerent
values of p: all these systems assigned with distinct but overlapping CDs.
These entanglements
would correspond to diﬀerent aspects of conscious experience. Maybe the real-real entanglement could
correspond to a positive emotion- perhaps love-, and the remaining to experiences of understanding
generating a connection between two diﬀerent things: between real world even and its cognitive
representation or between two cognitive representations. Note that the entanglement probabilities can
vary considerably and one can obtain identical a spectrum of entanglement probabilities by permuting

160
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
them. This should relate to the character of the experiencence of understanding. Schr¨odinger cat which
is almost dead has strong conviction that it is better to not open the bottle. The optimal situation
concerning understanding would be identical probabilities.
Analysis and conceptualization (synthesis) - formation of rules- could be seen as the reductionistic
and holistic aspects of consciousness.
The interpretation of quantum jump as a creation of a to-
tally entangled holistic state, which is then analyzed to stable entangled pieces allows to interpret self
measurement cascade as a conscious analysis. The resulting stable negentropic pieces give rise to expe-
rience of understanding and conceptualization - rules and abstractions. Perhaps the holistic character
assigned ot right brain hemisphere could be interpreted in terms of specialization to conceptualization
and reductionist character of left brain to entropic analysis to smallest possible pieces.
There are rather interesting connections with altered states of consciousness and states of macro-
temporal quantum coherence.
1. Making mind empty of mental images could perhaps be interpreted as a mechanism of achieving
irreducible self state. If self entangles negentropically with larger conscious entity this would
lead to experiences characterized as expansion of consciousness, even cosmic consciousness. One
could also consider the possibility the sub-selves representing mental images fuse to single long-
lasting negentropic mental image.
The absence of dissipation could relate to the reports of
meditators about lowered metabolic needs.
2. The ordinary wake-up consciousness is identiﬁable as the analytical mode in which entropic
entanglement dominates so that each U process is followed by a rather complete state function
reduction. The reason for this could be sensory input and motor activities, which would create
eﬀective heat bath destroying holistic mental images.
3. Krishnamurti has talked a lot about states of consciousness in which no separations and discrim-
inations occur and timelessness prevails. These states could correspond to long-lived negentropic
entanglement with large ℏwith larger conscious entities giving rise to very long eﬀective mo-
ments of consciousness. In this kind of situation NMP does not force cognitive self measurements
to occur and analysis and separations can thus be avoided.
4. Sharing and fusion of mental images by entanglement of sub-selves of separate selves makes
possible quantum realization of telepathy and could be a universal element of altered states
of consciousness. Also this entanglement could be bound state entanglement or negentropic
entanglement.
Cognitive codes
p-Adic length scale hypothesis leads to the idea that each p ≃2k, k integer, deﬁnes a hierarchy of
cognitive codes with code word having duration given by the n-ary p-adic time scale T(n, k) and
number of bits given by any factor of k. Especially interesting codes are those for which the number
of bits is prime factor or power of prime factor of k. n = 2 seems to be in special position in zero
energy ontology. This is a strong quantitative prediction since the duration of both the code word
and bit correspond to deﬁnite frequencies serving as signatures for the occurrence of commutations
utilizing these codes.
If k is prime, the amount of information carried by the codon is maximal but there is no obvious
manner to detect errors.
If k is not prime there are several codes with various numbers of bits:
information content is not maximal but it is possible to detect errors. For instance, k = 252 gives
rise to code words for which the number of bits is k1 = 252, 126, 63, 84, 42, 212, 9, 7, 62, 4, 32, 2: the
subscript 2 tells that there are two non-equivalent manners to get this number of bits. For instance,
126 = 42 × 3-bit codon can have 42 -bit parity codon: the bits of this codon would be products of
three subsequent bits of 126-bit codon. This allows error detection by comparing the error codon for
communicated codon and communicated error codon.
Abstraction hierarchy and genetic code
Mersenne primes Mn = 2n −1, which seem to play fundamental role in elementary particle physics
and it has been already found that their emergence is natural consequence of NMP. This would put
primes 3, 7, 31, 127, etc. in a special position. Primes appear frequently in various bio-structures

3.7. Some consequences of NMP
161
and this might reﬂect the underlying p-adicity for the association sequences providing ’plan’ for the
development of bio-system. For instance, we have actually 7 (!) ﬁngers: two of them have degenerated
during evolution but can be seen in the developing embryo. There are 31 subunits in our spinal chord,
etc...
In the model of genetic code based on a simple model of abstraction process [K31] the so called
Combinatorial Hierarchy 2, 3, 7, 127, 2127 −1, ... of Mersenne primes emerges naturally. The construc-
tion for a model of abstraction process proceeds as follows.
1. At lowest level there are two digits. The statements Yes and No.
2. At the next level one considers all Boolean statements about these two statements which can be
regarded as maps from 2-element set to 2-element set. There are 4 of them. Throw one away
and you get 3 statements.
3. At the next level one considers all Boolean statements about these 3 statements and the total
number of them is 23. Throw one away and you get 7 statements. And so on.
The mystery is why one statement must be thrown away at each level of the construction. The
answer might relate to a concrete model of quantum computation.
1. A possible neurolevel realization of a quantum computation is following. Entangle in the pro-
posed manner two memetic codewords represented as temporal sequences of 127 cognitive Z0
magnetized antineutrino ensembles with bit represented as the magnetization direction. The
phase transitions changing the direction of magnetization are assumed to involve classical non-
determinism.
2. Nerve pulse (or pulse like membrane oscillation) results from each ﬂip of the direction of the Z0
magnetization. The temporal sequence for which all Z0 magnetization are in the the direction of
the external Z0 magnetic ﬁeld is excluded because this state does not give rise to a nerve pulse
pattern (or membrane oscillation pattern). In this manner a quantum computer with N = 1
and p = 2127 −1 results. Incoming nerve pulse patterns could be taken to be identical memetic
codewords and out would go a a pair of memetic codewords representing the initial memetic
codeword and the result of the quantum computation.
The duration of the computation is
.1 seconds and involves 2127 −1 quantum jumps eﬀectively glued to single quantum jump by
macro-temporal quantum coherence.
The concepts of resolution and monitoring
The following considerations represent a rather early idea related to p-adic physics, and I am not sure
whether to take it seriously or not. The basic observation is that genuinely p-adic probabilities can
sum up to zero, and this might make possible some rather exotic looking eﬀects in genuinely p-adic
sectors of state space.
When the fundamental observable (density matrix or entropy operator) has degenerate eigenvalues,
one can only speak about probability for quantum jump to a particular eigen space of the the observable
since there is no preferred basis in this eigen space. This leads to the concept of cognitive resolution:
one cannot distinguish between states belonging to a given eigen space of density matrix and one can
make predictions for the probabilities for quantum jumps to given eigen space only.
1. Resolution and monitoring
p-Adic probability concept allows to consider an additional exotic eﬀect.
1. The total real probability for quantum jump to degenerate subspace is the real counterpart for
sum of p-adic probabilities rather than sum of the real counterparts of the p-adic probabilities.
This can lead to rather dramatic eﬀects: for instance, the sum of p-adic probabilities can be
very small even when the sum of the real probabilities is large.
2. The notion of resolution is closely related to the notion of monitoring: resolution can be deﬁned
as a decomposition of the p-adic state space to a direct sum of subspaces such that the p-adic
density matrix is degenerate inside each subspace. If p-adic probabilities are deﬁned modulo
O(p) pinary cutoﬀthis kind of degeneracy is bound to occur if the dimension of the state space
is larger than p.

162
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
An interesting possibility is that the notions of resolution and monitoring could be important in the
physics of cognition. Perhaps the well-known fact that the behavior of cognitive systems is sensitive
to monitoring, might have something to do with the density matrix characterizing the entanglement
between the monitoring and monitored systems. The behavior of monitored system would depend on
the resolution of the monitoring, that is on how interested monitorer is about behavior of monitored
system. In the limit that monitorer is not interested at all on the behavior, entanglement probabilities
would in general be identical and unless the number of states is power of p, S = 0 state would result.
The total probability for a set of independent events to occur depends on the resolution of mon-
itoring: not only the behavior of individual quantum system in ensemble but also the statistical
behavior of the ensemble of systems characterized by same p-adic prime depends on the resolution of
the monitoring.
Standard probability theory, which also lies at the root of the standard quantum theory, predicts
that the probability for a certain outcome of experiment does not depend on how the system is
monitored.
For instance, if system has N outcomes o1, o2, ...oN with probabilities p1, ..., pN then
the probability that o1 or o2 occurs does not depend on whether common signature is used for o1
and o2 or whether observer also detects which of these outcomes occurs. The crucial signature of
p-adic probability theory is that monitoring aﬀects the behavior of the system. NMP provides precise
deﬁnition for the concept of monitoring. There are two forms of monitoring depending on whether
the fundamental observable, denote it by O, is density matrix or entropy operator.
Consider ﬁrst the situation in which all entanglement probabilities have p-adic norm diﬀerent from
unity. Physically monitoring is represented by quantum entanglement and diﬀerentiates between two
eigen states of O (density matrix or entropy operator) only provided the eigenvalues of O are diﬀerent.
If there are several degenerate eigenvalues, quantum jump occurs to any state in the eigen space and
one can predict only the total probability for the quantum jump into this eigen space. Hence the p-adic
probability for a quantum jump to a given eigen space of density matrix is p-adic sum of probabilities
over the eigen states belonging to this eigen space:
Pi =
(n(i)P(i))R
P
j(n(j)P(j))R
.
Here ni are dimensions of various eigen spaces.
If the degeneracy of the eigenvalues is removed by an arbitrary small perturbation, the total
probability for the transition to the same subspace of states becomes the sum for the real counterparts
of probabilities and one has in good approximation:
P R =
n(i)P(i)R
[P
j̸=i
P
j(n(j)P(j))R + n(i)P(i)R] .
Rather dramatic eﬀects could occur. Suppose that that the entanglement probability P(i) is of
form P(i) = np, n ∈{0, p −1} and that n is large so that (np)R = n/p is a considerable fraction of
unity. Suppose that this state becomes degenerate with a degeneracy m and mn > p as integer. In this
kind of situation modular arithmetics comes into play and (mnp)R appearing in the real probability
P(1 or 2) can become very small. The simplest example is n = (p+1)/2: if two states i and j have very
nearly equal but not identical entanglement probabilities P(i) = (p + 1)p/2 + ϵ, P(j) = (p + 1)p/2 −ϵ,
monitoring distinguishes between them for arbitrary small values of ϵ and the total probability for the
quantum jump to this subspace is in a good approximation given by
P(1 or 2)
≃
x
hP
k̸=i,j(Pk)R + x
i ,
x
=
2 [(p + 1)p/2]R .
(3.7.1)
and is rather large. For instance, for Mersenne primes x ≃1/2 holds true. If the two states become
degenerate then one has for the total probability
P(1 or 2)
≃
x
hP
k̸=i,j(Pk)R + x
i ,
x
=
1
p .
(3.7.2)

3.7. Some consequences of NMP
163
The order of magnitude for P(1 or 2) is reduced by a factor of order 1/p!
A test for the notion of p-adic quantum cognition would be provided by the study of the de-
pendence of the transition rates of quantum systems on the resolution of monitoring deﬁned by the
dimensions of the degenerate eigen spaces of the subsystem density matrix (or entropy operator).
One could even consider the possibility of measuring the value of the p-adic prime in this manner.
The behavior of living systems is known to be sensitive to monitoring and an exciting possibility is
that this sensitivity, if it really can be shown to have statistical nature, could be regarded as a direct
evidence for TGD inspired theory of consciousness. Note that the mapping of the physical quantities
to entanglement probabilities could provide an ideal manner to compare physical quantities with huge
accuracy! Perhaps bio-systems have invented this possibility before physicists and this could explain
the miraculous accuracy of biochemistry in realizing genetic code.
If some entanglement probabilities have unit norm so that their contributions to the p-adic en-
tanglement entropy vanish, quantum jump to an entangled ﬁnal state can occur: this is genuinely
p-adic eﬀect and serves as a second test for p-adic cognition. If density matrix is the fundamental
observable, quantum jump can occur to an entangled ﬁnal state, which corresponds to any S = 0
subspace of S = 0 eigen space of the entropy operator with is eigen space of the density matrix. If
entropy operator is the fundamental observable, quantum jump can occur to any S = 0 subspace of
entropy operator. Again the total probability for the transition is determined by the p-adic sum of
the probabilities and dramatic ’interference’ eﬀects at the level of probabilities are possible.
Resolution and monitoring and hyperﬁnite factors of type II1
The notion of resolution emerges naturally for the hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1. The trace of the
unit operator is unit for the inﬁnite-dimensional space in question so that any projector with a ﬁnite
trace must project to an inﬁnite dimensional space so that there would always an inﬁnite-dimensional
degeneracy involved with the eigenvalues of the measured observables.
One could however consider the formulation of the theory in terms of p-adic probabilities and
for this formulation resolution and monitoring emerge naturally. One could go even further. For
instance, if one can specify the inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom as a p-adic integer, say N =
−1 = (p −1) P∞
k=0 pk, which in a well-deﬁned sense represents the largest p-adic integer, one can
say that the p-adic probability for a given state is 1/N and ﬁnite as a p-adic number. It is ﬁnite
also as a real number and equal to 1/p if canonical identiﬁcation is used to map N to a real number.
For a given ﬁnite-dimensional density matrix with ﬁnite number of distinct eigenvalues it would be
possible to have projections to one-dimensional subspace but there would always inﬁnitely degenerate
eigenvalue present in accordance with the notion of ﬁnite resolution.
A natural question concerns the implications of the assumption that the map of p-adic probabilities
to real ones conserves probabilities without additional normalization.
3.7.6
NMP and quantum computer type systems
TGD Universe can be regarded as an inﬁnite quantum computer. Unitarity process U is analogous
to a quantum computation. The state function reduction process represents a stepwise halting of the
computation proceeding until the resulting states are eith bound states or negentropically entangled
states. U matrix is between zero energy states and can be regarded as a collection of M-matrices
labelled by zero energy states. The possibility of two kinds of entropic and negentropic entanglement
makes possible two kinds of quantum computations and negentropic quantum computations based on
states which are longlived by the properties of the negentropic entanglement could be the one realized
in living matter.
The relationship between U-matrix and M-matrix
Before proceeding it is a good idea to clarify the relationship between the notions of U-matrix and M-
matrix. If state function reduction associated with time-like entanglement leads always to a product
of positive and negative energy states (so that there is no counterpart of bound state entanglement
and negentropic entanglement possible for zero energy states) U-matrix and can be regarded as a
collection of M-matrices

164
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
Um+n−,r+,s−
=
M(m+, n−)r+,s−
(3.7.3)
labeled by the pairs (m+, n−) labelling zero energy states assumed to reduced to pairs of positive
and negative energy states. M-matrix element is the counterpart of S-matrix element Sr,s in positive
energy ontology. Unitarity conditions for U-matrix read as
(UU †)m+n−,r+s−
=
X
k+,l−
M(m+, n−)k+,l−M(r+, s−)k+,l−= δm+r+,n−s−,
(U †U)m+n−,r+s−
=
X
k+,l−
M(k+, l−)m+,n−M(k+, l−)r+,s−= δm+r+,n−s−.
(3.7.4)
The conditions state that the zero energy states associated with diﬀerent labels are orthogonal as zero
energy states and also that the zero energy states deﬁned by the dual M-matrix
M †(m+, n−)k+,l−≡M(k+l−)m+,n−
(3.7.5)
-perhaps identiﬁable as phase conjugate states- deﬁne an orthonormal basis of zero energy states.
When time-like binding and negentropic entanglementare allowed also zero energy states with a
label not implying a decomposition to a product state are involved with the unitarity condition but
this does not aﬀect the situation dramatically. As a matter fact, the situation is mathematically the
same as for ordinary S-matrix in the presence of bound states.
How quantum computation in zero energy ontology diﬀers from ordinary quantum com-
putation
Quantum computation in zero energy ontology diﬀers in several respects from ordinary quantum
computation.
1. The time parameter deﬁning quantum computation as a unitary time evolution in standard
quantum physics disappears and corresponds to the U-matrix for single quantum jump. Quan-
tum computation corresponds to the U-matrix assignable to single quantum jump if one restricts
to sub-CDs with given time scale inside larger CD. The quantum jump for given sub-CD would
represent single quantum computation and the outcome of the quantum computation would be
determined statistically from the distribution of the outcomes of state function reductions for
over sub-CDs.
Quantum classical correspondence encourages to assign to the quantum computation an interval
of psychological time equal to the proper time distance between the tips of CD. For instance,
.1 seconds would the be time scale assignable to quantum computations possibly assignable to
electrons.
The hierarchies of CDs and Planck constants make possible zoomed up variants of quantum
computations. This kind of zooming might be essential for intelligent behavior since it is useful
to simulate dynamics of the external world in the time scales natural for brain and shorter than
the time scale during which it is necessary to react in order to survive. The geometric duration
of the shortest possible quantum computation with respect to the psychological time of self is
of order CP2 time about 104 Planck times, if the simplest estimate is correct.
2. The classical space-time correlates for the quantum computation are four-dimensional unlike in
the case of ordinary quantum compitation. In living matter nerve pulses and EEG frequencies
would be very natural correlates of this kind.
The model for DNA as topological quantum
computer [K23] has as its space-time correlates magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting DNA nucleotides
and lipids of nuclear and cell membranes deﬁning the braiding coding for the topological quantum
computation. Dynamical ﬂow of lipids deﬁnes the braiding in time direction and the memory
representation is in terms of the braiding of the ﬂux tubes induced by this ﬂow. A good metaphor

3.7. Some consequences of NMP
165
is in terms of dancers connected to a wall by threads. Dancing is the correlate for the running
quantum computer program and the geometric entanglement of threads the correlate for the
storage of the program to computer memory.
3. The outcome of quantum computation is described statistically in terms of a large set of quantum
computations. The statistical description of the conscious experience of ensemble of sub-selves
implies that mathematically the situation is very much analogous with that encountered in the
standard quantum computation and it is attractive to assume that conscious experience codes for
the outcome of quantum computation via the average quantities assignable to the distribution
of zero energy quantum states assignabl to sub-CDs.
4. A further new element is macro-temporal quantum coherence involving several aspects. One of
these aspects is that the time scale of CD deﬁnes macrotemporal quantum coherence at least at
the level of the ﬁeld body assignable to the physical system such as electron. It is not quite clear
whether electrons correspond to distinct overlapping CDs of size scale deﬁned by .1 second time
scale and of the order of Earth circumference and thus satisfying the basic criterion of quantum
coherence or whether one should speak about anyonic many particle states assignable to single
CD or whether both interpretations can make sense depending on situation. In living matter
also millisecond time scale is important and would correspond naturally to the CDs assignable
to u and d quarks in nuclei and perhaps also with the ends of magnetic ﬂux tubes in the model
of DNA as topological quantum computer. In the proposed model quarks and antiquarks at
the ends of ﬂux tubes represent genetic codons and their entangelement is responsible for the
realization of the program at quantum level. The millisecond time scale of synchronous cortical
ﬁring and of nerve pulse could correspond to the time scale of CDs associated with u and d
quarks at the ends of the ﬂux tube. Note that larger value of ℏwould scale up this time scale.
Quantum parallel dissipation taking place at various size scales for CD is a further new element.
5. One must generalize the standard quantum computer paradigm since ordinary quantum com-
puters represent only the lowest, 2-adic level of the p-adic intelligence. Qubits must be replaced
by qupits since for algebraic entanglement two-state systems are naturally replaced with p-state
systems. For primes of order say p ≃2167 (the size of small bacterium) this means about 167
bits, which would mean gigantic quantum computational resources. The secondary p-adic time
scale T2(127) ≃.1 seconds basic bit-like unit corresponds to M127 = 2127−1 M127-qupits making
about 254 bits. The size of neuron corresponds to CD with time scale equal to the age of the
universe and in this case the maximum the number of pinary digits is 171.
The ﬁnite measurement resolution for qubits of course poses strong limitations to the actual
number of bits since the negentropic zero energy qubits must be in reasonable approximation
pure qubits distinguishable from each other and could correspond CDs with time scales coming
as powers of two from n = kmin to k so that the eﬀective number of qubits would go like 2-based
logarithm of the p-adic prime. For instance, electron could correspond to six bits assignable to
genetic code plus parity bit corresponding to time scale range from 1 ms to 100 ms. In any case
the idea about neuron as a classical bit might be completely wrong!
6. Spin glass degeneracy also provides the needed huge number of degrees of freedom making quan-
tum computations very eﬀective. These degrees of freedom are associated with the join along
boundaries bonds -say magnetic ﬂux tubes- and are essentially gravitational so that a connection
with Penrose-Hameroﬀhypothesis suggests itself. The space-time sheets mediating gravitational
interaction are predicted to have a huge gravitational Planck constant ℏgr = GMm/v0, v0/c < 1,
particles at these space-time sheets are predicted to have huge Compton wavelengths and the
plausible looking identiﬁcation is in terms of dark energy [K73, K56] . This would make quantum
computation like activities possible in super-astronomical time scales.
Three kinds of quantum computations are possible in TGD Universe
In TGD Universe one must distinguish between three kinds of quantum computational modes.
Ordinary quantum computation utilizes only the part of U-matrix for which zero energy states
involved are unentangled products of positive and negative energy states. In this case quantum
coherence is extremely fragile and lasts for single quantum jump only but even in this case one

166
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
might hope that coherence time correspondences to the time scale CD. U-matrix can calso
correspond to the analogous of bound states for real time-like entanglement. If the proposed
interpretation makes sense these state pairs would not correspond to conscious rules. Negentropic
entanglement in time direction is the third option. For living quantum computers entanglement
could correspond to bound state entangelment or negentropic entanglement and NMP takes
care that the character of both these states is preserved. Thus bio-systems would be especially
attractive candidates for performers of quantum computation like processes.
Negentropic quantum computations, fuzzy qubits, and quantum groups
1. The possibility of negentropic entanglement is certainly the basic distinction making in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds possible conscious process at least analogous to a quantum
computation and accompanied by a conscious understanding.
What makes this possible is
the fact that the negentropically entangled states of N basic states have permutation of the
basis states as a symmetry.
For instance, states for which bit 1 appears with almost unit
probability gives by permutation a state for which bit 0 appears with almost unit probability.
This suggests that the outcome of quantum computation is expressed in terms of almost bits with
a small mixing implying that the outcome has interpretation both as a rule and as almost bit in
the ordinary sense. The conscious quantum computation would utilize states with negentropic
entanglement in time direction. Also the analogies of bound states for time-like engtanglement
are possible and might make possible the counterpart of ordinary quantum computation without
the higher level conscious experience about rules deﬁned by the entangled states.
2. Negentropic entanglement for positive and negative energy parts of bits stable and pinary digits
stable under NMP means that the logic is always fuzzy. I have proposed the mathematical
description of this in terms of quantum spinors for which the components do not commute
anymore implying that only the probability for either spin state is is an observable [K92] .
This suggests that negentropic entanglement might be describable in terms of quantum spinors
and that it would be the unavoidable fuzziness which would make possible the representation
conscious rules. What is interesting that for quantum spinors the spectrum of the probabilities
for given spin is universal and depends only on the integers characterizing the quantum phase
q = exp(i2π/n). An alternative interpretation is that fuzzy logic relates to a ﬁnite measurement
resolution. These interpretation need not be in conﬂict with each other. Since quantum groups
are associated with anyonic systems, this suggests that negentropic quantum computations take
place in anyonic systems assignable to phases with large value of ℏ. This encourages to consider
the possibility that quantum phases deﬁne algebraic extensions of p-adic numbers.
3. In living systems it might be more appropriate to talk about conscious problem solving instead
of quantum computation. In this framework the periods of macro-temporal quantum coher-
ence replace the unitary time evolutions at the gates of the quantum computer as the basic
information processing units and entanglement bridges between selves act as basic quantum
communication units with the sharing of mental images providing a communication mode not
possible in standard quantum mechanics.
3.8
Generalization of thermodynamics allowing negentropic
entanglement and a model for conscious information pro-
cessing
Costa de Beauregard considers a model for information processing by a computer based on an analogy
with Carnot’s heat engine [J50] , [J50] . I am grateful for Stephen Paul King for bringing this article
to my attention in Time discussion group and also for inspiring discussions which also led to the birth
of this section. As such the model Beauregard for computer does not look convincing as a model for
what happens in biological information processing.
Combined with TGD based vision about living matter, the model however inspires a model for
how conscious information is generated and how the second law of thermodynamics must be modiﬁed
in TGD framework. The basic formulas of thermodynamics remain as such since the modiﬁcation

3.8. Generalization of thermodynamics allowing negentropic entanglement and a model
for conscious information processing
167
means only the replacement S →S −N, where S is thermodynamical entropy and N the negentropy
associated with negentropic entanglement. This allows to circumvent the basic objections against the
application of Beauregard’s model to living systems. One can also understand why living matter is so
eﬀective entropy producer as compared to inanimate matter and also the characteristic decomposition
of living systems to highly negentropic and entropic parts as a consequence of generalized second law.
3.8.1
Beauregard’s model for computer
Beauregard’s model describes computer as information processor analogous to heat engine. The work
done by a heat engine is replaced with information generated by the computer and printing makes
this information manifest.
1. In Carnot cycle thermal energy is transformed to work and one gets the well known upper bound
for the eﬃciency from second law as η = W/Qin ≤∆T/Tin.
2. Beauregard a model for an ideal computer is as a system which performs no work but prints
instead. One studies information ﬂow instead of energy ﬂow. Negentropy is identiﬁed as a nega-
tive of thermodynamical entropy. Incoming negative negentropy ﬂow means coding of program
metaphorically at least and outgoing negentropy ﬂow to what results, when this coding is erased
in computer memory. The printed text carries the negentropy which in the optimal situation is
the diﬀerence between incoming and outgoing negentropies. This negentropy is sucked from the
incoming negative negentropy ﬂow so that second law holds true.
3. In terms of formulas one has dW = dQout −dQin = 0 and dS = dQout/Tout −dQin/Tin =
dQin(1/Tout −1/Tin) ≥0.
In the ideal case that the total entropy does not increase, this
entropy growth must be compensated by the reduction of the entropy of the printer by amount
dS interpreted as negentropy of the output.
4. This vision about computing is based on second law and identiﬁes information gain as diﬀerence
between two entropies. System can gain information by feeding disorder to the environment.
The best possible situation is that one has no information at all.
Ciriticism of the model
This model seems consistent with thermodynamics and skeptic would argue that what we see around
us could be seen as a support for this view about information processing in living systems. One can
however argue that the view about information as absence of entropy does not really make sense in
living matter.
1. p-Adic physics encourages the belief in genuine information. If living matter is identiﬁed as
something in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds it is possible to have a genuine information
represented as a negentropic entanglement. The number theoretic variant of Shannon entropy
gives a natural measure for this information since it can be negative and there is a unique p-adic
prime minimizing it. Conscious information is a rule A ↔B in which the pairs a ⊗b in the
quantum superposition represent the instances of the rule. Schr¨odinger cat knows that it should
not open the bottle by being a little bit dead but negentropically so.
2. Second point is that Boltzmann’s kinetic theory leading to the second law is based on the as-
sumption that quantum coherence is not present in the time scales considered. If this assumption
fails one cannot treat the system as a thermodynamical system (atoms represent standard ex-
ample of this). In zero energy ontology and accepting the hierarchy of Planck constants, there
are always levels of hierarchy for which second law does not make sense in a given time scale.
3. There is also a direct experimental evidence for the reversal of thermodynamical time and
therefore breaking of second law in time scales below .1 seconds, which happens to correspond
to the time scale assignable to the CD of electron and to a fundamental biorhythm. The evidence
comes from a system consisting of beads on necklace [D4] .

168
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
(a) Standard physics explanation would be in terms of ﬂuctuation in the value of entropy.
Fluctuation theorem [B2] allows to deduce a precise expression for the ratio of probabilities
of entropy ﬂuctuations of same magnitude but opposite sign as exp(A) where A represents
the magnitude of the ﬂuctuation. The appearance of .1 second time scale however forces
to challenge this interpretation.
(b) In TGD framework one possibility is that the spontaneous local reversal of the arrow
of geometric time induced from that of experienced time implies that second law with
reversed arrow of geometric time is operating. Second possibility is that genuine increase
of negentropy is in question.
Problems of Beauregard’s model if interpreted as a model for information processing in
living systems
Beauregard’s model for what he calls ”printer” looks problematic for several reasons.
1. Living matter and computers are in good approximation at the same temperature as environment
and temperature T and volume V are not changed during the process so that free energy F is
minimized rather than thermodynamical negentropy. This kind of systems are not analogous
to steam engines for which one has has incoming steam at higher temperature. Beauregard’s
analog of Carnot engine satisﬁes dW = dQout −dQin = 0 and indeed gives for Tin = Tout the
trivial result dN = 0. No information is generated. Even worse, living systems are typically at
higher temperature than environment so that the heat engine analogy does not seem to work
well.
2. In the analog of steam engine one actually assumes that the entropy diﬀerence for outgoing
and incoming beams corresponds to a positive negentropy assignable to the printing. One can
however treat the printer and computer as a single system in which case one can draw only one
conclusion from standard thermodynamics: this negentropy corresponds to work done by the
combined system and one has just the ideal steam engine but the work interpreted as printout.
Something however distinguishes between printer and steam engine.
3.8.2
TGD based variant of Beauregard’s model and generalization of ther-
modynamics
The TGD inspired variant of Beauregard’s model leads naturally to a generalization of the second law
of thermodynamics taking into account the possibility of negentropic entanglement.
Questions
Something distinguishes between printer and steam engine and standard thermodynamics is not able
to express this diﬀerence. What this something is? The proposal to be discussed is that the positive
entanglement negentropy assignable to rational (or even algebraic) entanglement generated in the
process in which conscious information is created. It is best to proceed by making questions.
1. The work done by steam engine is ”useful” work. What does this mean? Something which does
not have meaning for us but is a prerequisite for having meaning. Perhaps metabolic energy at
the basic level. This work can be eventually transformed to metabolic energy needed to build
mental images generated by the text.
2. What metabolic energy is? In TGD Universe there are two kinds of entanglements: the entropic
bound state entanglement and negentropic entanglement which is rational or even algebraic
and possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. Bound state entanglement is stable
under NMP by binding energy. This kind of entanglement is like a marriage based on social
conventions, a jail.
Negentropic entanglement does not involve binding energy and can be compared to a marriage
based on freedom and love. The positive energy associated with the negentropic entanglement
has wrong sign to be interpreted as binding energy and is identiﬁable as metabolic energy.
This identiﬁcation could explain the long standing mystery of the high energy phosphate bond

for conscious information processing
169
central for the functioning of ATP and ADP. ATP-ADP process would be basically a transfer
of negentropic entanglement and thus information to the living system and at work at all levels
in living matter.
3. What is the process giving meaning to the text? This process must generate negentropic en-
tanglement. The corresponding entanglement negentropy is something independent of thermo-
dynamic entropy and the safest assumption is that the generation of negentropic entanglement
is accompanied by the generation of thermodynamical entropy at least compensating it so that
second law in a generalized form continues to hold true.
What happens in quantum jump?
Quantum jump involves U process and state function reduction cascade. Negentropy Maximization
Principle implies second law for the standard view about state function reduction: second law states
that the ensemble entropy increases by the randomness of the outcome of the state function reduction
process. When negentropic entanglement is present the situation is not so clear. Before proceeding
to consider the modiﬁcation of the second law one must deﬁne more precisely what U process is.
The simplest view about quantum jump is as a unitary U-process followed by as a cascade of state
function reductions proceeding from top to bottom. But what is the top?
1. In positive energy ontology it would be entire Universe.
Quantum classical correspondence
suggests that one should be able to assign to quantum jump a duration of geometric time. For
this proposal this time is most naturally inﬁnite.
2. The vision about fractal hierarchy of selves and quantum jumps together with ZEO suggests
a more reﬁned view about quantum jump in which. U-process and subsequence state function
reduction cascade could occur independently for disjoint CDs. For a given CD the new sub-CDs
(representing mental images of the corresponding self) can be created and old destroyed so that
the only constraint would be that only disjoint CDs can perform quantum jumps independently.
For this option the duration of geometric time assignable to the quantum jump would naturally
correspond to the temporal distance between the tips of CD: p-adic length scale hypothesis and
number theoretical vision suggest that this distance comes as an octave of CP2 time scale (prime
or integer multiple is the more general option). For inﬁnitely large CD this would mean inﬁnite
duration. This picture is consistent with the TGD view about how the arrow of subjective time
induces the arrow of geometric time [K3] .
Modiﬁcation of thermodynamics to take into account negentropic entanglement
What does the presence of this negentropic entanglement mean from the point of view of thermo-
dynamics? There are two obvious options to consider. The optimistic option is just the standard
thermodynamics saying nothing about negentropy generation. The pessimistic option is that the gen-
eration of negentropy must be accompanied by a generation of at least the same amount of entropy:
the good news is that this entropy can be carried by diﬀerent system and it is possible to have gen-
uinely negentropic systems. The following consideration is restricted to the pessimistic option which
seems to be more realistic view about the world we live in.
1. One must generalize the basic expression for energy diﬀerential
dE
=
TdS −dW →T(dS −dN) −dW .
(3.8.1)
This means that there are two kinds of energies given out by the system. The useful work dW
and negentropic energy TdN. For steam engine only dW is present. For ideal system only
negentropic energy would be present.
2. What happens to the second law? The pessimistic guess is that generation of negentropy requires
a generation of at least same amount of entropy so that one would have

170
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
∆S −∆N ≥
0 .
(3.8.2)
Here S can be interpreted as a sum of two terms. The ﬁrst part corresponds to the ensemble
entropy generated by the randomness of ordinary quantum jumps, and second part to the entropy
assignable as maximal entanglement entropy assignable to the decompositions of bound state
to two parts. N corresponds to maximal negentropy for the decompositions of negentropic sub-
system to pairs. One can criticize these deﬁnitions and a possible modiﬁcation of could be as as
the average for the entanglement entropies over this kind of decompositions.
3. Quite generally, Clausius inequality allowing to deduce extremization conditions for various
thermodynamical potentials generalizes to
T0(∆S −∆N) −∆E −P0∆V
≥
0 .
(3.8.3)
where T0 and P0 and temperature and pressure of heat bath. Living systems would be entropy
producers and this seems to conform with what we see around us.
For instance, for a system in constant volume one would have
∆S −∆N −∆E
T
≥
0 .
(3.8.4)
so that systems developing negentropy would also generate thermodynamics entropy.
For a
system in heat bath one has T = T0 and Clausius inequality gives
∆F
=
−∆W
(3.8.5)
stating that increase of free energy at constant temperature requires work done on the system
(dW < 0): otherwise ∆F ≤0 holds true.
By using the variable S −N instead of S all formulas reduce formally to standard thermodynamics
except that S can be negative.
This is absolutely crucial for distinguishing TGD counterpart of
Beauregard’s printer -identiﬁable as conscious reader rather than printer - from Carnot engine.
The analog of Carnot cycle for information processing in living matter
Consider now Carnot heat engine and its information theoretic analog in this framework.
1. The basic equation for Carnot engine is
dW
=
dQin −dQout ≥0 .
(3.8.6)
Optimal eﬃciency corresponds to dSout = dSin.

3.8. Generalization of thermodynamics allowing negentropic entanglement and a model
for conscious information processing
171
2. For the information theoretic analog one would have
dW
=
0 ,
(3.8.7)
and
dN
=
dSout −dSin ≥0 .
(3.8.8)
The interpretation would be that incoming entropy ﬂow leaves the computer in a state of higher
entropy and the diﬀerence corresponds to information dN feeded to say printer. The increase
of entropy would have interpretation in terms of erasing of data from computer memory.
The problematic aspect of the model is that it requires Tin > Tout in order to have dN > 0.
For living systems one has however typically Tin < Tout. Already for Tin = Tout the situation
trivializes since one has
dN
=
0
(3.8.9)
by dW = 0 and dS = dQ/T.
3. Now however a more general condition
Tind(Sin −Nin) −Toutd(Sout −Nout)
≥
0
(3.8.10)
holds true and allows to generate conscious information provided it is compensated by thermo-
dynamical entropy. Note that the temperature of the environment can be even lower than the
temperatures of the system.
It is also possible to transform information to work as the expression for the diﬀerential dF =
−SdT −TdN −dW of the generalized free energy E = E −TS shows. The increase of dW
for the work done by the system is compensated by the reduction of information dN so that
system loses negentropy in the process keeping dF constant. The loss of negentropy couild be
interpreted in terms of a loss of metabolic energy which corresponds to negentropic entanglement
for AMP, ADP, and ATP molecules.
4. Beauregard calls the information engine printer. What does this ”printing” correspond from
the point of view of negentropic entanglement? Is the negentropic entanglement is generated
during physical printing or during the reading? If the negentropic entanglement is generated
before reading, there must be some other conscious entity for which the text has meaning. This
seems un-necessary assumption so that ordinary computers would not generate negentropic
entanglement. For the second and much more reasonable looking option the above process takes
place during the reading and the ”printing” as a name for the above process is misleading:
conscious reading is in question.
Some clarifying comments
Some clarifying comments about biological implications are in order. Many of them are inspired by
the questions of Stephen Paul King in Time discussion group.
1. There is no need to restrict the consideration to equilibrium systems. First of all, the environment
and living system are in general at diﬀerent temperatures and temperature diﬀerence is typically
of wrong sign for the model of Beauregard to work in this context. Beauregard’s model is of
course a model for computation, not for the generation of negentropic mental images. Maybe
cognitive machine might be proper term for what the modiﬁed model could describe.

172
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
2. Quite generally, self-organization requires a feed of energy to the system so that one has ﬂow equi-
librium. In the case of living system this feed of energy is metabolic energy associated with the
negentropic entanglement transferred to the system in the ATP-ADP process. Self-organization
driven by negentropic entanglement leads to standardized negentropic mental images automat-
ically as asymptotic self-organization patterns in 4-D sense (CDs within CDs within ...).
3. No explicit assumptions about computational aspects of the process has been made. Just a
generation of conscious information identiﬁed in terms of negentropic entanglement is assumed.
The basic character quantum jump as U-process followed by the cascade of state function re-
ductions represents a fractal hierarchy of what can be seen as quantum computations and are
distinguished from classical computations in that the process proceeds from top to bottom rather
than being a local process. The result of computation is represented using statistical ensembles
deﬁned by sub-CDs at various levels of the hierarchy and is in principle communicable by clas-
sical ﬁelds (say EEG patterns in the case of brain) to higher levels of self hierarchy which in
turn can induces the same distributions so that communication of the objective aspects of the
experience with the mediation of ”medium” is possible. The presence of the ”medium” seems
unavoidable. Magnetic body would be this medium in TGD inspired biology.
3.8.3
About implications of generalized second law
Generalized second law allows to sharpen the basic picture about implications of the second law.
Biological implications
Living matter involves also another aspect made possible by the generalized second law obtained
by the replacement S →S −N. Subsystem can have also negative net entropy and split to two
highly negentropic and entropic pieces. In the extreme situation this is nothing but excretion, which
is absolutely essential element of being alive but sometimes forgotten from the lists of properties
distinguishing living matter from inanimate matter. It is not at all clear whether this is possible for
standard non-equilibrium systems deﬁning information as a reduction of disorder. At all levels of the
fractal hierarchy division into negentropic and entropic subsystems is expected.
This picture seems to be in accordance with basic chemistry of energy metabolism.
1. The process creating both negentropy and entropy would be standardized in living matter and
mean a generation of high energy phosphate bonds assignable to AMP, ADP, and ATP containing
1, 2, and 3 phosphates respectively besides the sugar residue. Sugar residue is basic nutrient
and would provide the stored metabolic energy transformed to the negentropic energy of the
high energy phosphate bonds if the proposed view is correct. Also other DNA nucleotides such
as G can appear besides A but in metabolism A has a preferred role.
2. The basic metabolic cycle provides ADP with an additional phosphate energizing it to ATP
and the reverse process transfers the metabolic energy and also negentropic entanglement to
the acceptor molecule. Also ADP can provide metabolic energy by transforming to AMP when
ATP is not available in suﬃcient amounts. That the catabolism of AMP creates urea excreted
out of the system ﬁts with the general picture. The catabolism for nutrients would create the
entropy compensating for the negentropy of the high energy phosphate bonds.
3. The backbone of DNA is made of sugar and phosphate residues and corresponds to a sequence
of XMP, X = A, T, C, G with each XMP presumably containing single high energy phosphate
bond serving as a storage or potential source of negentropy. This conforms with the view that
DNA carries conscious information.
Negentropic and entropic entanglement are assumed to generate mental images with opposite
emotional colors. This connects information processing with emotions. From neuroscience point of
view this is not a news: peptides are molecules of emotions on one hand and molecules of information
on the other hand [J102] .
The well-known specialization of the left and right hand sides of the
amygdala to experience positive and negatively colored emotions could be seen as one instance of this
connection and representing also an example about fractal negentropic-entropic diﬀerentiation.

The interpretation of generalized second law in a wider context
Leaving the narrow conﬁnes of thermodynamics one could try to interpret the generalized second law
in a wider context.
1. The generalized second law unavoidably brings in mind the Good-Evil dichotomy. Good deeds
seem to induce evil deeds. Maybe this kind of polarization eﬀect is indeed unavoidable in the
situations for which thermodynamics applies.
The cruciﬁcation of a man whose sole crime
was to suggest that we should love also our enemies expresses this paradoxical truth in very
deep manner. Thermodynamical approximation can however fail and the hierarchy of Planck
constants and zero energy ontology predict that this occurs.
Maybe the Eastern teachings
promising a way out from the cycle of endless suﬀering are inspired by experiences in which no
Good-Evil polarization takes place. The ATP-ADP cycle generating negentropy and at least
same amount of entropy has more than obvious analogy with the Karma’s cycle.
2. One cannot avoid associations with the basic teachings of Christianity. U process would cor-
respond to Genesis creating the paradise. Eating the fruits from the tree of Good and Bad
Knowledge would correspond to the emergence of cognition producing islands of negentropy and
entropy and meaning a banishment from paradise. ”With hard work of you hands must you will
get your bread” would correspond to endless ﬁght for getting metabolic energy transformed to
energy associated with the negentropic entanglement.
Heaven and hell would be the islands of negentropy and entropy resulting during the state
function reduction process. The next U-process re-creating the heaven and and Earth would be
the new Genesis and the moment of mercy meaning a new possibility to be used or lost for both
saints and sinners. If U-process is local in the sense that it can occur independently for disjoint
CDs, the situation is rather comforting since salvation possibly brought by the next moment of
recreation requires only a ﬁnite time of waiting.
3.9
Updates since 2012
I have collected in this section the updates motivated by the progress in TGD and TGD inspired
theory of consciousness since 2012. NMP [K44] implies that negentropic entanglement is approxi-
mately invariant under quantum jumps. This allows to build a direct connection with the basic idea
of quantum biology about the braiding of magnetic ﬂux tubes as a correlate for the negentropic en-
tanglement and identify braidings as kind of ”Akashic records” giving rise to various representations
(sensory - , memory - , cognitive - ) deﬁning reﬂective level of consciousness as opposed to phenomenal
consciousness deﬁned by sensory qualia. NMP in the rational intersection of realities and p-adicities in
turn ﬁxes the p-adic prime associated with the criticality at the intersection. Also a close connection
between quantum criticality, life as something in the intersection of realities and p-adicities, hierar-
chy of eﬀective vales of Planck constant, negentropic entanglement, and p-adic view about cognition
emerges. The reader interested in details can consult a more detailed representation about the recent
vision about TGD inspired theory of consciousness [K97].
3.9.1
The anatomy of quantum jump in zero energy ontology (ZEO)
Zero energy ontology emerged around 2005 and has had profound consequences for the understand-
ing of quantum TGD. The basic implication is that state function reductions occur at the opposite
light-like boundaries of causal diamonds (CDs) forming a hierarchy, and produce zero energy states
with opposite arrows of imbedding space time. Also concerning the identiﬁcation of quantum jump
as moment of consciousness ZEO encourages rather far reaching conclusions. In ZEO the only dif-
ference between motor action and sensory representations on one hand, and intention and cognitive
representation on the other hand , is that the arrows of imbedding space time are opposite for them.
Furthermore, sensory perception followed by motor action corresponds to a basic structure in the
sequence of state function reductions and it seems that these processes occur fractally for CDs of
various size scales.
1. State function reduction can be performed to either boundary of CD but not both simultaneously.
State function reduction at either boundary is equivalent to state preparation giving rise to a

174
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
state with well deﬁned quantum numbers (particle numbers, charges, four-momentum, etc...)
at this boundary of CD. At the other boundary single particle quantum numbers are not well
deﬁned although total conserved quantum numbers at boundaries are opposite by the zero energy
property for every pair of positive and negative energy states in the superposition. State pairs
with diﬀerent total energy, fermion number, etc.. for other boundary are possible: for instance,
t coherent states of super-conductor for which fermion number is ill deﬁned are possible in zero
energy ontology and do not break the super-selection rules.
2. The basic objects coding for physics are U-matrix, M-matrices and S-matrix. M-matrices corre-
spond to a orthogonal rows of unitary U-matrix between zero energy states, and are expressible
as products of a hermitian square root of density matrix and of unitary S-matrix which more or
less corresponds to ordinary S-matrix. One can say that quantum theory is formally a square
root of thermodynamics. The thermodynamics in question would however relate more naturally
to NMP rather than second law, which at ensemble level and for ordinary entanglement can be
seen as a consequence of NMP.
The non-triviality of M-matrix requires that for given state reduced at say the ”lower” boundary
of CD there is entire distribution of statesat ”upper boundary” (given initial state can lead to
a continuum of ﬁnal states). Even more, all size scales of CDs are possible since the position of
only the ”lower” boundary of CD is localized in quantum jump whereas the location of upper
boundary of CD can vary so that one has distribution over CDs with diﬀerent size scales and
over their Lorentz boots and translates.
3. The quantum arrow of time follows from the asymmetry between positive and negative energy
parts of the state: the other is prepared and the other corresponds to the superposition of the
ﬁnal states resulting when interactions are turned on. What is remarkable that the arrow of
time at imbedding space level at least changes direction when quantum jump occurs to opposite
boundary.
This brings strongly in mind the old proposal of Fantappie [J62] that in living matter the arrow
of time is not ﬁxed and that entropy and its diametric opposite syntropy apply to the two
arrows of the imbedding space time. The arrow of subjective time assignable to second law
would hold true but the increase of syntropy would be basically a reﬂection of second law since
only the arrow of the geometric time at imbedding space level has changed sign. The arrow
of geometric at space-time level which conscious observer experiences directly could be always
the same if quantum classical correspondence holds true in the sense that the arrow of time for
zero energy states corresponds to arrow of time for preferred extremals. The failure of strict
non-determinism making possible phenomena analogous to multifurcations makes this possible.
4. This picture diﬀers radically from the standard view and if quantum jump represents a funda-
mental algorith, this variation of the arrow of geometric time from quantum jump to quantum
jump should manifest itself in the functioning of brain and living organisms. The basic building
brick in the functioning of brain is the formation of sensory representation followed by motor
action. These processes look very much like temporal mirror images of each other such as the
state function reductions to opposite boundaries of CD look like. The fundamental process could
correspond to a sequences of these two kinds of state function reductions for opposite bound-
aries of CDs and maybe independently for CDs of diﬀerent size scales in a ”many-particle” state
deﬁned by a union of CDs.
How the formation of cognitive and sensory representations could relate to quantum jump?
1. ZEO allows quantum jumps between diﬀerent number ﬁelds so that p-adic cognitive represen-
tations can be formed and intentional actions realized. How these quantum jumps are realized
at the level of generalized Feynman diagrams is non-trivial question: one possibility suggested
by the notion of adele combining reals and various p-adic number ﬁelds to a larger structure is
that the lines and vertices of generalized Feynman diagrams can correspond to diﬀerent number
ﬁelds [K94].
The formation of cognitive representation could correspond to a quantum jump in which real
space-time sheet identiﬁed as a preferred extremal is mapped to its p-adic counterpart or su-
perposition of them with the property that the discretized versions of all p-adic counterparts

3.9. Updates since 2012
175
are identical. In the latter case the chart map of real preferred extremal would be quantal and
correspond to delocalized state in WCW. The p-adic chart mappings are not expected to take
place but with some probabilities determined by the number theoretically universal U-matrix.
2. Similar consideration applies to intentional actions realized as real chart maps for p-adically
realized intention. The natural interpretation of the process is as a time reversal of cognitive
map. Cognitive map would be generated from real sensory represention and intentional action
would transform time reversed cognitive map to real ”motor” action identiﬁable as time reversal
of sensory perception. This would occur in various length scales in fractal manner.
3. The formation of superpositions of preferred extremals associated with discrete p-adic chart
maps from real preferred extremals could be interpretated as an abstraction process. Similar
abstraction could take place also in the mapping of p-adic space-time surface to a superposition of
real preferred extrmals representing intentional action. U-matrix should give also the probability
amplitudes for these processes, and the intuitive idea is that the larger then number of common
rational and algebraic points of real and p-adic surfaces is, the higher the probability for this is:
the ﬁrst guess is that the amplitude is proportional the number of common points. On the other
hand, large number of common points means high measurement resolution so that the number
of diﬀerent surfaces in superposition tends to be smaller.
4. One should not make any un-necessary assumptions about the order of various kinds of quantum
jumps. For the most general option real-to-padic and p-adic-to-real quantum jumps can follow
any quantum jumps and state function reductions to opposite boundaries of CD can also occur
any time in any length scale. Also the length scale of resolution scale assignable to the cognitive
representation should be determined probabilistically. Quantal probabilities for quantum jumps
should therefore apply to all aspect of quantum jump and now ad hoc assumptions should
be made. Very probably internal consistency allows only very few alternative scenarios. The
assumption that the cascade beginning from given CD continues downwards until stops due to
the emergence of negentropic entanglement looks rather natural constraint.
3.9.2
About NMP and quantum jump
NMP is assumed to be the variational principle telling what can happen in quantum jump and says
that the information content of conscious experience for the entire system is maximized.
In zero
energy ontology (ZEO) the deﬁnition of NMP is far from trivial and the recent progress - as I believe
- in the understanding of structure of quantum jump forces to check carefully the details related to
NMP. A very intimate connection between quantum criticality, life as something in the intersection
of realities and p-adicities, hierarchy of eﬀective vales of Planck constant, negentropic entanglement,
and p-adic view about cognition emerges. One ends up also with an argument why p-adic sector is
necessary if one wants to speak about conscious information. I will proceed by making questions.
What happens in single state function reduction?
State function reduction is a measurement of density matrix. The condition that a measurement
of density matrix takes place implies standard measurement theory on both real and p-adic sectors:
system ends to an eigen-space of density matrix. This is true in both real and p-adic sectors. NMP is
stronger principle at the real side and implies state function reduction to 1-D subspace - its eigenstate.
The resulting N-dimensional space has however rational entanglement probabilities p = 1/N so
that one can say that it is the intersection of realities and p-adicities. If the number theoretic variant
of entanglement entropy is used as a measure for the amount of entropy carried by entanglement rather
than either entangled system, the state carries genuine information and is stable with respect to NMP
if the p-adic prime p divides N. NMP allows only single p-adic prime for real →p-adic transition:
the power of this prime appears is the largest power of prime appearing in the prime decomposition
of N. Degeneracy means also criticality so that that ordinary quantum measurement theory for the
density matrix favors criticality and NMP ﬁxes the p-adic prime uniquely.
If one - contrary to the above conclusion - assumes that NMP holds true in the entire p-adic sector,
NMP gives in p-adic sector rise to a reduction of the negentropy in state function reduction if the
original situation is negentropic and the eigen-spaces of the density matrix are 1-dimensional. This

176
Chapter 3. Negentropy Maximization Principle
situation is avoided if one assumes that state function reduction cascade in real or genuinely p-adic
sector occurs ﬁrst (without NMP) and gives therefore rise to N-dimensional eigen spaces. The state
is negentropic and stable if the p-adic prime p divides N. Negentropy is generated.
The real state can be transformed to a p-adic one in quantum jump (deﬁning cognitive map) if
the entanglement coeﬃcients are rational or belong to an algebraic extension of p-adic numbers in
the case that algebraic extension of p-adic numbers is allowed (number theoretic evolution gradually
generates them).
The density matrix can be expressed as sum of projection operators multiplied
by probabilities for the projection to the corresponding sub-spaces. After state function reduction
cascade the probabilities are rational numbers of form p = 1/N.
Number theoretic entanglement entropy also allows to avoid some objections related to fermionic
and bosonic statistics. Fermionic and bosonic statistics require complete anti-symmetrization/symmetrization.
This implies entanglement which cannot be reduced away. By looking for symmetrized or antisym-
metrized 2-particle state consisting of spin 1/2 fermions as the simplest example one ﬁnds that the
density matrix for either particle is the simply unit 2 × 2 matrix. This is stable under NMP based on
number theoretic negentropy. One expects that the same result holds true in the general case. The
interpretation would be that particle symmetrization/antisymmetrization carries negentropy.
The degeneracy of the density matrix is of course not a generic phenomenon and one can argue
that it corresponds to some very special kind of physics. The identiﬁcation of space-time correlates
for the hierarchy for the eﬀective values ℏeff = nℏof Planck constant as n-furcations of space-time
sheet suggests strongly the identiﬁcation of this physics in terms of this hierarchy. Hence quantum
criticality, the essence of life as something in the rational intersection of realities and p-adicities, the
hierarchy of eﬀective values of ℏ, negentropic quantum entanglement, and the possibility to make
real-p-adic transitions and thus cognition and intentionality would be very intimately related. This is
a highly satisfactory outcome, since these ideas have been rather loosely related hitherto.
What happens in quantum jump?
Suppose that everything can be reduced to what happens for a given CD characterized by a scale.
There are at least two questions to be answered.
1. There are two processes involved. State function reduction and quantum jump transforming
real state to p-adic state (matter to cognition) and vice versa (intention to action). Do these
transitions occur independently or not? Does the ordering of the processes matter? The proposed
view about state function reduction strongly suggests that the p-adic ↔real transition (if possible
at all) can occur any time without aﬀecting the outcome of the state function reduction.
2. State function reduction cascade in turn consists of two diﬀerent kinds of state function reduc-
tions. The M-matrix characterizing the zero energy state is product of square root of density
matrix and of unitary S-matrix and the ﬁrst step means the measurement of the projection op-
erator. It deﬁnes a density matrix for both upper and lower boundary of CD and these density
matrices are essentially same.
(a) At the ﬁrst step a measurement of the density matrix between positive and negative energy
parts of the quantum state takes place for CD. One can regard both the lower and upper
boundary as an eigenstate of density matrix in absence of negentropic entanglement. The
measurement is thus completely symmetric with respect to the boundaries of CDs. At the
real sector this leads to a 1-D eigen-space of density matrix if NMP holds true. In the
intersection of real and p-adic sectors this need not be the case if the eigenvalues of the
density matrix have degeneracy. Zero energy state becomes stable against further state
function reductions! The interactions with the external world can of course destroy the
stability sooner or later.
An interesting question is whether so called higher states of
consciousness relate to this kind of states.
(b) If the ﬁrst step gave rise to 1-D eigen-space of the density matrix, a state function reduction
cascade at either upper of lower boundary of CD proceeding from long to short scales. At
given step divides the sub-system into two systems and the sub-system-complement pair
which produces maximum negentropy gain is subject to quantum measurement maximizing
negentropy gain.
The process stops at given subsystem resulting in the process if the

3.9. Updates since 2012
177
resulting eigen-space is 1-D or has negentropic entanglement (p-adic prime p divides the
dimension N of eigenspace in the intersection of reality and p-adicity).

Self and Binding
4.1
Introduction
The conﬂict between the non-determinism of state function reduction and determinism of time evolu-
tion of Schr¨odinger equation is serious enough a problem to motivate the attempt to extend physics
to a theory of consciousness by raising the observer from an outsider to a key notion also at the level
of physical theory by bringing in the notion of self. Further motivations come from the failure of
the materialistic and reductionistic dogmas in attempts to understand consciousness in neuroscience
context. There are reasons to doubt that standard quantum physics could be enough to achieve this
goal and the new physics predicted by TGD is indeed central in the proposed theory.
4.1.1
Quantum jump as moment of consciousness and the notion of self
If quantum jump occurs between two diﬀerent time evolutions of Schr¨odinger equation (understood
here in very metaphoral sense) rather than interfering with single deterministic Schr¨odinger evolution,
the basic problem of quantum measurement theory ﬁnds a resolution. The interpretation of quantum
jump as a moment of consciousness means that volition and conscious experience are outside space-
time and state space and that quantum states and space-time surfaces are ”zombies”. Quantum jump
would have actually a complex anatomy corresponding to unitary process U, state function reduction
and state preparation at least.
Quantum jump has a complex anatomy since it must include state preparation, state function
reduction, and also unitary process characterized by U-matrix. Zero energy ontology means that one
must distinguish between M-matrix and U-matrix. M-matrix characterizes the time like entanglement
between positive and negative energy parts of zero energy state and is measured in particle scattering
experiments. M-matrix need not be unitary and can be identiﬁed as a ”complex” square root of density
matrix representable as a product of its real and positive square root and of unitary S-matrix so that
thermodynamics becomes part of quantum theory with thermodynamical ensemble being replaced
with a zero energy state. The unitary U-matrix describes quantum transitions between zero energy
states and is therefore something genuinely new. It is natural to assign the statistical description of
intentional action with U-matrix since quantum jump occurs between zero energy states.
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) codes for the dynamics of standard state function
reduction and states that the state function reduction process following U-process gives rise to maximal
reduction of entanglement entropy at each step. In the generic case this implies decomposition of the
system to unique unentangled systems and the process repeats itself for these systems. The process
stops when the resulting subsystem cannot be decomposed to a pair of free systems since energy
conservation makes the reduction of entanglement kinematically impossible in the case of bound
states.
Intuitively self corresponds to a sequence of quantum jumps which somehow integrates to a larger
unit much like many-particle bound state is formed from more elementary building blocks. It also
seems natural to assume that self stays conscious as long as it can avoid bound state entanglement
with the environment in which case the reduction of entanglement is energetically impossible. One
could say that everything is conscious and consciousness can be only lost when the system forms
bound state entanglement with environment.

Chapter 4. Self and Binding
There is an important exception to this vision based on ordinary Shannon entropy. There exists
an inﬁnite hierarchy of number theoretical entropies making sense for rational or even algebraic entan-
glement probabilities. In this case the entanglement negentropy can be negative so that NMP favors
the generation of negentropic entanglement, which need not be bound state entanglement in standard
sense. Negentropic entanglement might serve as a correlate for emotions like love and experience of
understanding. The reduction of ordinary entanglement entropy to random ﬁnal state implies second
law at the level of ensemble. For the generation of negentropic entanglement the outcome of the
reduction is not random: the prediction is that second law is not universal truth holding true in all
scales. Since number theoretic entropies are natural in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds, this
suggests that life resides in this intersection. The existence eﬀectively bound states with no binding
energy might have important implications for the understanding the stability of basic bio-polymers
and the key aspects of metabolism [K26] . A natural assumption is that self experiences expansion of
consciousness as it entangles in this manner. Quite generally, an inﬁnite self hierarchy with the entire
Universe at the top is predicted.
Self is assumed to experience sub-selves as mental images identiﬁable as ”averages” of their mental
images. This implies the notion of ageing of mental images as being due to the growth of ensemble
entropy as the ensemble consisting of quantum jumps (sub-sub-subselves) increases.
If one accepts the hierarchy of Planck constants [K24] , it might be un-necessary to distinguish
between self and quantum jump. The hierarchy of Planck constants interpreted in terms of dark matter
hierarchy predicts a hierarchy of quantum jumps such that the size of space-time region contributing
to the contents of conscious experience scales like ℏ. Also the hierarchy of space-time sheets labeled
by p-adic primes suggests the same. That sequence of sub-selves/sub-quantum jumps are experienced
as separate mental images explains why we can distinguish between digits of phone number. The
irreducible component of self (pure awareness) would correspond to the highest level in the ”personal”
hierarchy of quantum jumps and the sequence of lower level quantum jumps would be responsible
for the experience of time ﬂow. Entire life cycle would correspond to single quantum jump at the
highest(?) level of the personal self hierarchy and pure awareness would prevail during sleep: this
would make it possible to experience directly that I existed yesterday.
There are thus two deﬁnitions of self. The ﬁrst deﬁnition introduces self as a notion separate from
quantum jump. Second deﬁnition reduces the notion of self to a fractal hierarchy of quantum jumps.
The equivalence between two deﬁnitions of the notion of self will be proposed.
4.1.2
Sharing and fusion of mental images
The standard dogma about consciousness is that it is completely private. It seems that this cannot
be the case in TGD Universe.
Von Neumann algebras known as hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1
(HFF) [K92, K24] provide the basic mathematical framework for quantum TGD and this suggests
important modiﬁcations of the standard measurement theory besides those implied by the zero energy
ontology predicting that all physical states have vanishing net quantum numbers and are creatable
from vacuum. The notion of measurement resolution characterized in terms of Jones inclusions N ⊂M
of HFFs implies that entanglement is deﬁned always modulo some resolution characterized by inﬁnite-
dimensional sub-Cliﬀord algebra N playing a role analogous to that of gauge algebra.
This modiﬁcation has also important implications for consciousness. For ordinary quantum mea-
surement theory separate selves are by deﬁnition unentangled and the same applies to their sub-selves
so that they cannot entangle and thus fuse and shared mental images are impossible: consciousness
would be completely private.
Space-time sheets as correlates for selves however suggests that space-time sheets topologically
condensed at larger space-time sheets and serving as space-time correlates for mental images can be
connected by join along boundaries bonds so that mental images could fuse and be shared.
HFFs allow to realize mathematically this intuitive picture. The entanglement in N degrees of
freedom between selves corresponding to M is below the measurement resolution so that these selves
can be regarded as separate conscious entities. These selves can be said to be unentangled although
their sub-selves corresponding to N (mental images at upper level) can entangle. Fusion and sharing
of mental images becomes possible. For instance, in stereo vision right and left visual ﬁelds would fuse
together. More generally, a pool of shared stereo mental images might be fundamental for evolution
of social structures and development of social and moral rules and language (shared mental images

4.1. Introduction
181
make possible common meaning for symbols of language). A concrete realization for this would be in
terms of hyper-genome making possible collective gene expression [K31, K40] .
4.1.3
Qualia
Since physical states are labeled by quantum numbers, various qualia correspond naturally to the
increments of quantum numbers in quantum jump which leads to a general classiﬁcation of qualia in
terms of the fundamental symmetries [K28] . One can speak also about geometric qualia assignable
to the increments of zero modes which correspond to the classical variables in ordinary quantum
measurement theory and non-quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom which do not contribute to
the metric of world of classical worlds (WCW) in TGD framework. Dark matter hierarchy suggests
that also qualia form a hierarchy with larger values of Planck constant identiﬁable as more reﬁned
qualia. Rather amusingly, visual colors would correspond to increments of color quantum numbers
assignable to quarks and gluons in standard model physics. The term ”color”, originally introduced
as an algebraic joke, would directly relate to visual color.
4.1.4
Self-referentiality of consciousness
Quantum classical correspondence is the basic guiding principle of quantum TGD. Thanks to the
failure of a complete determinism of classical dynamics, space-time surface can provide symbolic
representations not only for quantum states (as maximal deterministic regions) but also for quantum
jump sequences (sequences of quantum states) and thus for the contents of consciousness.
These
representations are regenerated in each quantum jump, and make possible the self referentiality of
consciousness: self can be conscious of what it was conscious of.
4.1.5
Hierarchy of Planck constants and consciousness
The hierarchy of Planck constants is realized in terms of a generalization of the causal diamond
CD × CP2, where CD is deﬁned as an intersection of the future and past directed light-cones of 4-D
Minkowski space M 4. CD × CP2 is generalized by gluing singular coverings and factor spaces of both
CD and CP2 together like pages of book along common back, which is 2-D sub-manifold which is M 2
for CD and homologically trivial geodesic sphere S2 for CP2 [K24] . The value of the Planck constant
characterizes partially given page and arbitrary large values of ℏare predicted so that macroscopic
quantum phases are possible since the fundamental quantum scales scale like ℏ. All particles in the
vertices of Feynman diagrams have the same value of Planck constant so that particles at diﬀerent
pages cannot have local interactions. Thus one can speak about relative darkness in the sense that
only the interactions mediated by the exchange of particles and by classical ﬁelds are possible between
diﬀerent pages. Dark matter in this sense can be observed, say through the classical gravitational and
electromagnetic interactions. It is in principle possible to photograph dark matter by the exchange
of photons which leak to another page of book, reﬂect, and leak back. This leakage corresponds to
ℏchanging phase transition occurring at quantum criticality and living matter is expected carry out
these phase transitions routinely in bio-control. This picture leads to no obvious contradictions with
what is really known about dark matter and to my opinion the basic diﬃculty in understanding of
dark matter (and living matter) is the blind belief in standard quantum theory.
Dark matter hierarchy and p-adic length scale hierarchy would provide a quantitative formulation
for the self hierarchy. To a given p-adic length scale one can assign a secondary p-adic time scale
as the temporal distance between the tips of the causal diamond (pair of future and past directed
light-cones in H = M 4 × CP2). For electron this time scale is .1 second, the fundamental biorhythm.
For a given p-adic length scale dark matter hierarchy gives rise to additional time scales coming as
ℏ/ℏ0 multiples of this time scale. These two hierarchies could allow to get rid of the notion of self
as a primary concept by reducing it to a quantum jump at higher level of hierarchy. Self would in
general consists of quantum jumps inside quantum jumps inside... and thus experience the ﬂow of
time through sub-quantum jumps.

4.1.6
Zero energy ontology and consciousness
Zero energy ontology was forced by the interpretational problems created by the vacuum extremal
property of Robertson-Walker cosmologies imbedded as 4-surfaces in M 4 × CP2 meaning that the
density of inertial mass (but not gravitational mass) for these cosmologies was vanishing meaning a
conﬂict with Equivalence Principle. In zero energy ontology physical states are replaced by pairs of
positive and negative energy states assigned to the past resp. future boundaries of causal diamonds
deﬁned as pairs of future and past directed light-cones (δM 4
± × CP2). The net values of all conserved
quantum numbers of zero energy states vanish. Zero energy states are interpreted as pairs of initial
and ﬁnal states of a physical event such as particle scattering so that only events appear in the new
ontology.
Zero energy ontology combined with the notion of quantum jump resolves several problems. For
instance, the troublesome questions about the initial state of universe and about the values of con-
served quantum numbers of the Universe can be avoided since everything is in principle creatable
from vacuum. Communication with the geometric past using negative energy signals and time-like
entanglement are crucial for the TGD inspired quantum model of memory and both make sense in
zero energy ontology. Zero energy ontology leads to a precise mathematical characterization of the
ﬁnite resolution of both quantum measurement and sensory and cognitive representations in terms of
inclusions of von Neumann algebras known as hyperﬁnite factors of type II1. The space-time correlate
for the ﬁnite resolution is discretization which appears also in the formulation of quantum TGD.
At the imbedding space-level CD is the correlate of self whereas space-time sheets having their ends
at the light-like boundaries of CD are the correlates at the level of 4-D space-time. The hierarchy of
CDs within CDs corresponds to the hierarchy of selves. Zero energy ontology leads also an argument
explaining why the arrow of subjective time induces an apparent arrow of geometric time as a result
if intentional action and why the contents of sensory consciousness is restricted to such a narrow time
interval (located near the future boundary of CD).
4.1.7
Evolution of the ideas about self
For a long time the basic hypothesis of TGD inspired theory of consciousness was that single quantum
jump between quantum histories determines the contents of conscious experience associated with a
particular moment of consciousness. It however became gradually clear that this hypothesis is subject
to several objections, the most serious one being that genuine memories about previous conscious
experiences (quantum jumps) are not possible if single quantum jump determines everything. These
counter arguments served as a pressure forcing the discovery of the quantum notion of self.
An
essential prerequisite for the notion of self were parallel developments related to the p-adic aspects of
quantum TGD.
The understanding of the notion of self did not emerge as an instantaneous ﬂash but has been
plagued by some mis-interpretations as the evolution of the new concepts usually is. The progress in
the understanding of quantum TGD, initiated by ’TGD as a generalized number theory’ vision, has
been of importance also in attempts to achieve a more precise deﬁnition of the notion of self. The most
central clariﬁcations in the conceptual framework have been following ones. p-Adic physics is identiﬁed
as the physics of imagination, cognition and intention and space-time has a genuine decomposition
into regions with a local topology which is real or p-adic (what these p-adic regions really mean
turned out to be highly non-trivial question!); quantum jump decomposes into a TGD counterparts
of the unitary process followed by the state function reduction process equivalent to state preparation
process for the next quantum jump governed by Negentropy Maximization Principle [K44] ; quantum
measurement theory follows as a basic prediction of quantum TGD; the sequences of quantum jumps
deﬁning selves deﬁne what might be identiﬁed as fundamental statistical ensembles growing in size
quantum jump by quantum jump; statistical physics becomes part of the theory of consciousness, in
particular the theory of qualia.
Further steps in the progress were following.
1. The observation that bound state entanglement is stable in state function reduction process
so that the binding of mental images in this manner could involve liberation of usable energy
(quantum metabolism);
2. The discovery of a hierarchy of number theoretic entropies which can be also negative making

4.1. Introduction
183
possible to assign to a rationally or even algebraically entangled system a positive entanglement
entropy.
In the intersection of real and p-adic worlds this means negentropic entanglement
stable under state function reduction. Unfortunately this led ﬁrst to an erratic conclusion that
this entanglement must represent bound state entanglement.
There is no need for this and
negentropic entanglement can carry positive energy suggesting obvious applications to biology
(high energy phosphate bond and purely understood stability of highly charged DNA strands)
[K26] . Negentropic entanglement is now perhaps the most inﬂuental idea of TGD inspired
theory of consciousness.
3. The notion many-sheeted space-time led to a realization that sub-selves of two separate selves
can entangle and that this corresponds to the fusion and sharing of mental images providing
a fundamental mechanism of quantum communication.
Note that sharing of mental images
can correspond to generation entropic bound state entanglement meaning that subselves lose
consciousness and negentropic entanglement meaning that subselves experience an expansion of
consciousness. The realization that the sharing of mental images is only possible by adopting a
length scale dependent deﬁnition of sub-system motivated the fact that topologically condensed
space-time sheets resemble black holes in many respects.
The discovery that von Neumann
algebras known as hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 (HFFs) emerge naturally in TGD and that
their inclusions deﬁne in a natural manner the notion of measurement resolution provided a
mathematical justiﬁcation for the entanglement modulo ﬁnite measurement resolution.
4. Zero energy ontology led to a new view about quantum jump as taking place between zero
energy states with unitary U-matrix deﬁning a collection of orthonormal M-matrices deﬁning
entanglement coeﬃcients between positive and negative energy parts of the zero energy states.
Causal diamonds (CDs) identiﬁed roughly as intersections of future and past directed light-
cones deﬁne the imbedding space correlates of selves and space-time surfaces inside CDs deﬁned
the space-time correlates of selves.
In fact, holography allows to reduce these correlates to
partonic 2-surfaces and their four-dimensional tangent space distributions at the future and
past boundaries of CDs. This led to a considerable progress in understanding of the relationship
between experienced time identiﬁed as a sequence of quantum jumps and the geometric time
of physicist. p-Adic length scale hypothesis follows if the proper time distance between the
tips of CDs is quantized in powers of two. The intriguing prediction is a direct connection
between elementary particle physics and macroscopic physics: for electron the temporal size of
CD corresponds to .1 seconds deﬁning the fundamental biorhythm and for u and d quarks it is
consistent with millisecond time scale deﬁning the rhythm of synchronous cortical neuron ﬁring.
5. The introduction of the hierarchy of Planck constants identiﬁed in terms of dark matter hierarchy
meant a further step in the progress and it became possible to understand how living matter can
act as a macroscopic quantum system. The notion of magnetic body acting as an intentional
agent quantum controlling biological boddy is absolutely essential piece of the recent view about
living matter and has had a strong impact on the development of ideas about self.
Ironically, the latest step in the progress means an almost return to where all began. The notion
of self might be reduced to quantum jump after all by adding to it the attribute ”fractal”. The idea
was motivated by two new concepts: zero energy ontology and the generalization of the notion of
imbedding space predicting a hierarchy of Planck constants labeling a hierarchy of phases of matter
identiﬁed as dark matter. The formation of many particle bound states and negentropically entangled
states might allow sequences of quantum jumps to combine to single eﬀective quantum jump making
possible macro-temporal quantum coherence and quantum computation type processes for irreducible
selves in a state of ’oneness’. In particular, time like negentropic entanglement between the partons
at future and past boundaries of CD should be highly relevant for the temporal binding of quantum
jumps. It took some years to decide whether the reduction of self to a fractal hierarchy of quantum
jumps within quantum jumps can be consistent with the earlier view about self. This seems to be
the case. Also it took time to give a real meaning to the phrase ”quantum jumps within quantum
jumps”. The new picture allows surprisingly quantitative answers to a long list of questions about
the relationship of geometric and subjective time: this will be summarized later in the introduction
and discussed in detail later.
There has been also a lot of pseudo progress.
The understanding of the relationship between
geometric and subjective time in TGD framework has been especially diﬃcult challenge. By quantum

184
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
classical correspondence the arrow of subjective time should be mapped to the arrow of geometric time
at the level of conscious experience. In similar manner the asymmetry between subjective future and
past should be correspond to an asymmetry between geometric future and past. What this means at
the level of details has been far from clear and I have proposed many partial answers to the question
about the arrow of geometric time. For instance: the geometric future inside light-cone contains much
more room than geometric past so that the space-time region about which the contents of conscious
experience are about tends to diﬀuse to the direction of the geometric future deﬁned by light-cone
proper time; perhaps the ﬂow of geometric time corresponds to a wave front of intentional action
identiﬁable as a phase transition changing intentions identiﬁed as p-adic space-time sheets transformed
to real space-time sheets; maybe the space-time sheet assignable to self topologically condensed to
a larger space-time sheet shifts in quantum jumps to the direction of geometric future some average
temporal distance perhaps deﬁned by CP2 length scale. All these proposals have provided only partial
answers, have led to paradoxes, and failed to give a ﬁrm quantitative grasp about the situation.
Also the original wrong view about the correspondence of real and p-adic numbers has generated
a lot of confusion. The natural belief of topologist would be that p-adic space-time sheets are mapped
to their real counterparts by a continuous map (some variant of what I called canonical identiﬁcation
making sense in p-adic thermodynamics). This map did not however respect symmetries and was
inconsistent with ﬁeld equations. Finally I was able to accept the natural belief of algebraist: reals
and various p-adic number ﬁelds must be glued to together along rationals and common algebraic
numbers to achieve generalization of the number concept and also that of imbedding space. What
was diﬃcult to accept was the highly non-intuitive implication that most points of p-adic space-
time sheets are at spatial and temporal inﬁnity in real (but not in p-adic) sense so that cognition
and intentionality would be literally cosmic phenomena and only cognitive representations would be
realized in a ﬁnite space-time volume in real sense (causal diamond) in terms of intersections of real
and p-adic space-time sheets consisting of rational and some algebraic points.
The plan of the chapter is as follows.
• Because of its importance NMP [K44] is introduced in a separate section.
• The notion of quantum self is the topic of next section. The role of entanglement in binding is
analyzed. The basic assumptions about the structure of conscious experience of self and their
basic implications are summarized. The question whether the notions of self and quantum jump
can be identiﬁed is analyzed.
• Some applications at brain level are considered including the diﬀerences between left and right
brain hemispheres and music experience.
• Negentropic entanglement seems to be the key to the understanding of altered states of con-
sciousness. What I call whole-body consciousness is discussed in this framework. Also EEG
synchrony and synesthesia are analyzed in terms of negentropic entanglement.
• Higher levels of biological self hierarchy are discussed. Here the notion of magnetic body is
central.
• An attempt to understand what happens in ageing and death is made.
4.2
Negentropy Maximization Principle
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP [K44] ) stating that the reduction of entanglement entropy
is maximal at a given step of state function reduction process following U-process is the basic varia-
tional principle for TGD inspired theory of consciousness and says that the information contents of
conscious experience is maximal. Although this principle is diametrically opposite to the second law
of thermodynamics it is structurally similar to the second law. NMP does not dictate the dynamics
completely since in state function reduction any eigen state of the density matrix is allowed as ﬁnal
state. NMP need not be in contradiction with second law of thermodynamics which might relate as
much to the ageing of mental images as to physical reality.

4.2. Negentropy Maximization Principle
185
4.2.1
Basic form of NMP
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) in its original form codes for the basic rules of the standard
state function reduction and implies that system ends up to an eigenstate of the density matrix
identiﬁed as observable. In TGD framework must ask whether NMP should be restricted only to the
entanglement between zero modes of WCW representing classical degrees of freedom and quantum
ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom or generalize it to apply to any pair of subsystems so that state function
reduction sequence could be regarded as a sequence of self measurements. I have chosen the latter
option as a working hypothesis.
NMP that the state function reduction process following U-process gives rise to a maximal re-
duction of entanglement entropy at each step of the process. State function process could proceed
at the level of all CDs. It is not clear whether one can assign any geometric time duration to this
process or whether there is any need for this. If the ubsystem allows entangled pairs of free systems
(no binding energy) there is more or less unique pair with the maximal entanglement entropy and
NMP therefore implies a decomposition to a unique pair of unentangled systems. The process repeats
itself for these systems and stops when the resulting subsystem cannot be decomposed to a pair of free
systems since energy conservation makes the reduction of entanglement kinematically impossible in
the case of bound states. Number theoretic entanglement entropies mean an important modiﬁcation
of this picture.
4.2.2
Number theoretic Shannon entropy as information
The notion of number theoretic entropy obtained by can be deﬁned by replacing in Shannon entropy the
logarithms of probabilities pn by the logarithms of their p-adic norms |pn|p. This replacement makes
sense for algebraic entanglement probabilities if appropriate algebraic extension of p-adic numbers is
used. What is new that entanglement entropy can be negative, so that algebraic entanglement can
carry information and NMP can force the generation of bound state entanglement so that evolution
could lead to the generation of larger coherent bound states rather than only reducing entanglement.
A possible interpretation for algebraic entanglement is in terms of experience of understanding or
some positive emotion like love.
Standard formalism of physics lacks a genuine notion of information and one can speak only about
increase of information as a local reduction entropy. It seems strange that a system gaining wisdom
should increase the entropy of the environment. Hence number theoretic information measures could
have highly non-trivial applications also outside the theory consciousness.
NMP combined with number theoretic entropies leads to an important exception to the rule that
the generation of bound state entanglement between system and its environment during U process
leads to a loss of consciousness. When entanglement probabilities are rational (or even algebraic)
numbers, the entanglement entropy deﬁned as a number theoretic variant of Shannon entropy can
be non-positive (actually is) so that entanglement carries information. NMP favors the generation of
algebraic entanglement. The attractive interpretation is that the generation of algebraic entanglement
leads to an expansion of consciousness (”fusion into the ocean of consciousness”) instead of its loss.
State function reduction period of the quantum jumps involves much more than in wave mechan-
ics. For instance, the choice of quantization axes realized at the level of geometric delicacies related
to CDs is involved. U-process generates a superposition of states in which any sub-system can have
both real and algebraic entanglement with the external world. If state function reduction involves
also a choice between generic and negentropic entanglement (between real world, a particular p-adic
world, or their intersection) it might be possible to identify a candidate for the physical correlate for
the choice between good and evil. The hedonistic complete freedom resulting as the entanglement
entropy is reduced to zero on one hand, and the algebraic bound state entanglement implying cor-
relations with the external world and meaning giving up the maximal freedom on the other hand.
The hedonistic option is risky since it can lead to non-algebraic bound state entanglement implying
a loss of consciousness. The second option means expansion of consciousness - a fusion to the ocean
of consciousness as described by spiritual practices. Note that if the total entanglement negentropy
deﬁned as sum of contributions from various levels of CD hierarchy up to the highest matters in NMP
then also subselves should develop negentropic entanglement. For instance, the generation of entropic
entanglement at cell level can lead to a loss of consciousness also at higher levels. Life would evolve
from short to long scales.

186
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
4.2.3
Can one deﬁne measures for the information contents of mental im-
age?
Despite the fact that one cannot write formula for the contents of conscious experience, one can
deﬁne information measures for conscious experience as diﬀerences of the information measures for
the initial and ﬁnal quantum histories. Negentropy gain is the most natural information measure of
this kind. For instance, the sum of the net entanglement negentropy gains over the steps of the self
measurement cascade could deﬁne a quantity characterizing net information gain for a single moment
of consciousness at each step.
One could also information measure to selves as the entanglement negentropy after the state
function reduction process has ended. This would assign to each subsystem stable under NMP a
negentropy. For bound state entanglement this information would be negative but for negentropic
entanglement it would be positive. One can ask whether the hypothesis that this information increases
during quantum jump sequence is equivalent with NMP. In the case of entire Universe the application
of this principle becomes problematic.
Entropy gradients with respect to subjective time could be used to characterize how the information
gain of conscious experience of self changes. These gradients approach zero when self approaches
thermal equilibrium. In TGD framework entropy gradients correlate with emotions, which means
a somewhat counter intuitive connection between emotions and information gain or loss (consistent
however with the fact that peptides are both informational molecules and molecules of emotion [J102]
). Note that the binding of information molecules to receptors means the formation larger bound
states accompanied by the experience of oneness at molecular level (are sex and spiritual experiences
present already at the molecular level?) and macro temporal quantum coherence so that quantum
computer like operations might become possible.
4.2.4
Life as islands of rational/algebraic numbers in the seas of real and
p-adic continua?
Rational and even algebraic entanglement coeﬃcients make sense in the intersection of real and p-adic
words, which suggests that life and conscious intelligence reside in the intersection of the real and
p-adic worlds. This would mean that the mathematical expressions for the space-time surfaces (or
at least 3-surfaces or partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D tangent planes) make sense in both real and
p-adic sense for some primes p. Same would apply to the expressions deﬁning quantum states. In
particular, entanglement probabilities would be rationals or algebraic numbers so that entanglement
can be negentropic and the formation of bound states in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds
generates information and is thus favored by NMP.
The identiﬁcation of intentionality as the basic aspect of life seems to be consistent with this idea.
1. The proposed realization of the intentional action has been as a transformation of p-adic space-
time sheet to a real one. Also transformations of real space-time sheets to p-adic space-time
sheets identiﬁable as cognitions are possible. Algebraic entanglement is a prerequisite for the
realization of intentions in this manner. Essentially a leakage between p-adic and real worlds is
in question and makes sense only in zero energy ontology. The reason is that various quantum
numbers in real and p-adic sectors are not in general comparable in positive energy ontology so
that conservation laws would be broken or even cease to make sense.
2. The transformation of intention to action can occur if the partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D
tangent space-distributions are representable using rational functions with rational (or even
algebraic) coeﬃcients in preferred coordinates for the imbedding space dictated by symmetry
considerations. Intentional systems must live in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
3. For the minimal option life would be also eﬀectively 2-dimensional phenomenon and essentially a
boundary phenomenon as also number theoretical criticality suggests. There are good reasons to
expect that only the data from the intersection of real and p-adic partonic two-surfaces appears
in U-matrix so that only the data from rational and some algebraic points of the partonic 2-
surface dictate U-matrix. This means discretization at parton level and something which might
be called number theoretic quantum ﬁeld theory should emerge as a description of intentional
action.

4.3. Quantum self
187
A good guess is that algebraic entanglement is essential for quantum computation, which therefore
might correspond to a conscious process. Hence cognition could be seen as a quantum computation
like process, a more approriate term being quantum problem solving [K23] . Living-dead dichotomy
could correspond to rational-irrational or to algebraic-transcendental dichotomy: this at least when
life is interpreted as intelligent life. Life would in a well deﬁned sense correspond to islands of rational-
ity/algebraicity in the seas of real and p-adic continua. Life as a critical phenomenon in the number
theoretical sense would be one aspect of quantum crticality of TGD Universe besides the criticality
of the space-time dynamics and the criticality with respect to phase transitions changing the value of
Planck constant and other more familiar criticalities. How closely these criticalities relate remains an
open question [K69] .
The view about the crucial role of rational and algebraic numbers as far as intelligent life is
considered, could have been guessed on very general grounds from the analogy with the orbits of a
dynamical system. Rational numbers allow a predictable periodic decimal/pinary expansion and are
analogous to one-dimensional periodic orbits. Algebraic numbers are related to rationals by a ﬁnite
number of algebraic operations and are intermediate between periodic and chaotic orbits allowing an
interpretation as an element in an algebraic extension of any p-adic number ﬁeld. The projections of
the orbit to various coordinate directions of the algebraic extension represent now periodic orbits. The
decimal/pinary expansions of transcendentals are un-predictable being analogous to chaotic orbits.
The special role of rational and algebraic numbers was realized already by Pythagoras, and the fact
that the ratios for the frequencies of the musical scale are rationals supports the special nature of
rational and algebraic numbers. The special nature of the Golden Mean, which involves
√
5, conforms
the view that algebraic numbers rather than only rationals are essential for life.
4.2.5
Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 and NMP
Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 bring in additional delicacies to NMP. The basic implication of ﬁnite
measurement resolution characterized by Jones inclusion is that state function reduction can never
reduce entanglement completely so that entire universe can be regarded as an inﬁnite living organism.
It would seem that entanglement coeﬃcients become N valued and the same is true for eigen states
of density matrix. For quantum spinors associated with M/N entanglement probabilities must be
deﬁned as traces of the operators N. An open question is whether entanglement probabilities deﬁned in
this manner are algebraic numbers always (as required by the notion of number theoretic entanglement
entropy) or only in special cases.
4.3
Quantum self
The section introduces the deﬁnition of self, discusses the role of entanglement in binding, intro-
duces the basic assumptions about the structure of conscious experience of self and some of their
consequences and closes with a couple of questions related
4.3.1
Self as a sub-system able to avoid entropic bound state entanglement
The original proposal for circumventing the objections against quantum jump as a moment of con-
sciousness identiﬁcation was based on the idea that selves are eﬀectively their own sub-Universes, that
is sub-systems able to remain unentangled in subsequent quantum jumps consisting of the unitary
process U followed by the TGD counterpart of state function reduction process which acts as state
function preparation process for the next quantum U-process. The hypothesis was that the self expe-
rience of a sub-system lasts for so many quantum jumps as sub-system avoids entangling with some
other self.
This picture was however not quite correct. It is plausible that generation of entropic bound state
entanglement indeed leads to a loss of consciousness since state function reduction is not possible by
energy conservation. In the case of negentropic entanglement the natural interpretation is however as
an expansion of consciousness: as a fusion the sea of consciousness as mystics would express it. This
would deﬁne the ”eastern” strategy for remaining conscious and even expand the consciousness. The
hedonistic ”western” strategy guarantees maximal independence from environment but there is a risk
that consciousness is lost.

188
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
The unitary process U generates a maximally entangled state, a multiverse superposition of quan-
tum potentialities. State function reduction (or self measurement process) consists of a cascade of self
measurements proceeding from long to short length scales and decomposing a given sub-system in a
unique manner to two pieces (maximization of negentropy gain) if entanglment is real and stopping
if the system does not allow a decomposition to a pair of entropically entangled free states or if it is
negentropically entangled. Essentially a conscious analysis is in question.
The highly nontrivial question is what deﬁnes the identity of the self as a physical system. Zero
energy ontology allows to identify imbedding space and space-time and correlates of selves in terms
of causal diamonds and partonic 2-surfaces assignable to their light-like boundaries. Also the p-adic
prime characterizing the partonic 2-surfaces serving as the geometric correlate of self could characterize
self identity: at least when partonic 2-surface belongs to the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
Holography allows to regard also space-time sheeets and 3-surfaces as correlates of selves and in
the following I use these diﬀerent characterizations freely. Also the notion of mind-like space-time
sheet which in zero energy ontology brings in nothing new is used. A very natural proposal is that
living matter belongs to this intersection and therefore represents a phase which is critical in number
theoretical sense. It took amazingly long to end up with this identiﬁcation although the notion of
number theoretic entropy has been known to me for more than half decade.
Space-time surface decomposes into real and p-adic regions in various sectors of the generalized
imbedding space obtained by gluing real and various p-adic variants together along rational points
and common algebraic points (note that p-adic surfaces have inﬁnite size in real sense!). Rational or
even algebraic entanglement between regions corresponding to diﬀerent number ﬁelds is in principle
possible. It is natural to assume that this kind of entanglement is possible only if the partonic 2-
surfaces in diﬀerent number ﬁelds are in the intersection of real and various p-adic worlds in the sense
that they obey same mathematical representation -say in terms of rational functions in preferred
coordinates and with polynomials involved having rational or algebraic coeﬃcients. Contrary to the
original belief, this entanglement need not be reduced in state function reduction and its algebraic
character indeed implies that this cannot be the case [K44] . The interpretation is in terms of the
formation of cognitive representations -association based rules- in which real states are mapped to
p-adic ones or p-adic states with diﬀerent primes are mapped to each other. U matrix can also induce
a leakage between real and p-adic worlds in the intersection. This makes possible the realization of
intentional action as transformation of p-adic space-time surface to its real variant. The reversal of
the process makes possible formation of cognitive images of real system.
In real context the natural proposal is that the space-time correlates of selves can be identiﬁed as
space-time sheets with subselves (mental images) represented as smaller space-time sheets fused by
topological sum to the larger space-time sheet by wormhole contacts which have Euclidian signature
of induced metric and so that their throats can be identiﬁed as light-like 3-surfaces.
Irreducible
self corresponds would correspond to space-time sheets having no smaller space-time sheets of this
kind. The corresponding 2-dimensional partonic surfaces are however disjoint and one can wonder
whether one should actually restrict the subselves to be partonic 2-surfaces glued to larger partonic
2-surfaces by corresponding wormhole contacts. Quantum holography does not provide an answer
to the question. For the partonic option there is however no unique manner to identify subselves
geometrically unlike for the ﬁrst option. Therefore the ﬁrst option seems to be correct. One could say
that topological sum is a correlate for the summation of mental images and joing along boundaries
bond (connected sum for partonic 2-surfaces) for the fusion of mental images.
In p-adic context this picture makes sense only as its algebraic variant. The wormhole throats
as light-like surfaces and partonic 2-surfaces as intersections of light-like 3-surfaces and light-like
boundaries of CDs indeed make sense also in the p-adic context.
Self can disappear only by a
topological phase transition changing the number ﬁeld associated with the self, if the space-time sheet
disappears, or if a join along boundaries bond connects two space-time sheets and gives rise to a
fusion of selves and formation of quantum bound state representing the fused self. Also entire CDs
can disappear in quantum jump.
The formation of bound states and negentropically entangled states means that the entire sequence
of quantum jumps during which bound state property is preserved, corresponds eﬀectively to a single
quantum jump. One might expect that time-like negentropic entanglement is especially interesting
in this respect. This means macro-temporal quantum coherence in the time scale of the duration of
this kind of state. Otherwise macro-temporal quantum coherence lasts only for the average increment
of the geometric time associated with single quantum jump, which can be identiﬁed as time scale

4.3. Quantum self
189
assignable to CD and whose minimum value is about CP2 time roughly equal to 10−39 seconds.
Macrotemporal quantum coherence makes possible for the self to act as a quantum computer type
system. Also the experience of self, which is subjecto-temporal average over quantum jumps, contains
in this case useful information since complete thermalization is avoided.
4.3.2
Binding and quantum entanglement
How diﬀerent components of conscious experiences, such as various sensory qualia and the active
components of conscious experience involving thoughts, conscious selections and volition, integrate
to single experience, is known as binding problem. In the original approach I distinguished between
bindingof conscious experiences and binding of conscious experiencers. Since mental images deﬁne
experiences and are itself experiencers at a lower level of hierarchy, there seems however to be no need
for this kind of distinction.
Quantum entanglement as a mechanism of binding
Quantum entanglement provides a mechanism of binding of selves to larger selves. Depending on
whether the resulting entanglement is entropic bound state entanglement or negentropic entanglement,
the selves lose consciousness or experience an expansion of consciousness. At the level of mental images
(sub-selves) this corresponds to the integration of parts to wholes. Negentropic entanglement could
create mental images representing rules as a collection of instances of rule as pairs of quantum states.
Negentropically entangled Schr¨odinger cat would know that it is better to not open the bottle. The
entangled mental images (more precisely, corresponding partonic 2-surfaces) can belong to diﬀerent
number ﬁelds in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds in which case entanglement is automatically
negentropic.
The successes of p-adic physics suggest that it should be possible to label also real selves/space-
time sheets by p-adic primes. At least in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds this assumption
could make sense. Hence also real selves would form a p-adic hierarchy. Zero energy ontology implies
this kind of hierarchy automatically and the hierarchy of Planck constants extends this hierarchy
further.
The fusion of selves to a larger self by bound state entanglement means a formation of a bound
state and the binding energy could be liberated as a usable energy. Thus quantum metabolism could
accompany the negentropic binding of the mental images. In the case of negentropic entanglement
the possibility that the binding energy is eﬀectively negative would also make possible liberation of
energy, and I have proposed that this might take place in ATP→ADP+Pi deﬁning the fundamental
step of metabolism in which the high energy phosphate bond is believed to liberate metabolic energy
quantum [K26] . High energy phosphate bond could correspond to a magnetic ﬂux tube carrying
the negentropic entanglement. Jail and love are good metaphors for the two kinds of correlations
represented by bound state entanglement and negentropic entanglement.
Diﬀerent components of sensory experience, even sensory qualia, naturally correspond to separate
sub-selves, whose individual experiences are separate but combine to form various qualia in our expe-
rience. In TGD framework they could correspond to sensory pathways or parts of them and perhaps
containing also primary sensory organs: this option looks at this moment the most convincing one.
Quite generally, it seems that the reliability of the sensory experiences and the absence of experienced
volition is guaranteed by the hypothesis about subjective memory. Experienced volition is most natu-
rally related to the selection between diﬀerent maxima of K¨ahler function rather than quantum jumps
reducing the entanglement.
For instance, synchronous neuronal ﬁring could be understood as a consequence of almost simulta-
neous wake-up of neuronal sub-selves near criticality for phase transition changing the local topology
of the space-time sheets associated with sub-self. 40 Hz neural synchrony to be discussed later has a
nice interpretation in terms of the generation of negentropic entanglement.
If neurons have sub-selves, also subneuronal quantum jumps are possible and this could eventually
make synchronous assembly and de-assemly of microtubules and even synchronously occurring bio-
chemical reactions possible. Primary sensory experiences could occur in part of the sensory pathway
containing also primary sensory organ and nerve pulse activity could be regarded as resulting from
the creation or wake-up of sensory sub-self by quantum jump leading to state able to remain unentan-
gled. It came as a surprise that in TGD universe our sensory representations (an entire hierarchy is

190
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
involved) could be realized at the magnetic sensory canvas associated with the electromagnetic body
accompanying the physical body and having size much larger than the physical body [K37] .
A possible example of the bound state entanglement of sub-selves could be the binding of right
and left visual ﬁelds to single visual ﬁeld. The visual ﬁelds can sometimes fail to bind: this should
result from the failure of the corresponding sub-selves to generate mutual entanglement with suﬃcient
rate or at all (the connection between brain hemispheres is lacking).
Bio-feedback is a well-established phenomenon in which person receives feedback from the be-
haviour of, say, single neuron and learns to control voluntarily its behaviour. A possible mechanism
of bio-feedback is based on quantum entanglement generated between the (sub)self of the person and
the self of neuron. Socio-feedback at the level of entire society could be important mechanism making
possible to establish moral and behavioural rules of the society: this socio-feegback is perhaps the
basic function of sleep.
Binding geometrically
Quantum-classical correspondence suggests that the concept of binding should have a counterpart
at the level of space-time geometry.
The gluing of the space-time sheets by topological sum to
larger space-time sheets creates nested hierarchical structures. This suggests that the summation of
mental images to a collection of mental images experienced by a given self corresponds geometrically
to the gluing of the material space-time sheets of sub-selves to the material space-time sheet of
self by topological sum operation involving the formation of ’wormhole contacts’ (having physical
identiﬁcation as bosons and their super partners). The topological sum of space-time sheets belonging
to diﬀerent number ﬁelds does not seem to make sense, which suggests that mental images belonging
to diﬀerent number ﬁelds cannot sum although they can bind by necessarily negentropic entanglement.
The binding of experiences (or experiencers) in turn would naturally correspond to the glueing
of 3-surfaces together along their boundaries by join along boundaries bonds (topological sum for
boundaries). Join along boundaries contacts translate more or less to magnetic ﬂux tubes in the
recent view about TGD and would be correlate for both kinds of entanglement. The entanglement
between diﬀerent number ﬁelds cannot be described in terms of join along boundaries bonds. The only
reasonable description for the entanglement between the copies of the partonic 2-surface in diﬀerent
number ﬁelds seems to be in terms of the data about rational and common algebraic points of the
surface deﬁning their ”intersection”.
The geometric counterpart of self deﬁnes a geometric representation for the subjective history of the
self. For instance, larger mindlike space-time sheets at the higher level of the hierarchy could contain
or generate holes making possible for smaller mindlike space-time sheets to form join along boundaries
bonds. This mechanism would provide a concrete geometric realization for the communication between
diﬀerent levels of the hierarchy of selves. For instance, long term memories could become conscious
through this kind of mechanism.
There are several arguments supporting the importance of join along boundaries bonds.
1. The dynamical realization of the self hierarchy as a master-slave hierarchy of various kinds
of super conductors [K57, K58] relies on the identiﬁcation of the join along boundaries bonds
between the space-time sheets belonging to various levels of hierarchy as Josephson junctions.
The ”biofeedback” made possible by the join along boundaries bond makes it possible for the
selves at higher levels of the hierarchy to experience what it is to be lower level self. In particular,
our immediate sub-selves are represented by topological ﬁeld quanta of ELF em ﬁelds associated
with EEG frequencies and thus have size of order Earth’s circumference by Uncertainty Principle,
whereas sensory experiences involve in essential manner entanglement with sub..sub-selves with
size scale of neuronal circuits.
2. Magnetic ﬂux tubes are perhaps the most interesting join along boundaries contacts in the TGD
based quantum model of biology. Wormhole magnetic ﬂux tubes consisting of a pair of space-
time sheets with opposite time orientations, carrying magnetic ﬂuxes with opposite directions,
and containing also dark matter with large value of Planck constant are especially interesting.
They play a key role in TGD inspired view about bio-chemistry and in the model of DNA as
topological quantum computer [K23] .
Cognitive entanglement between real and p-adic variants of the partonic 2-surface should be prob-
able only for preferred primes.
The succesful applications of p-adic physics give good reasons to

4.3. Quantum self
191
believe that real partonic 2-surfaces and also space-time regions can be a labelled by p-adic primes
characterizing their eﬀective p-adic topology. This should make sense at least in the intersection of
real and p-adic worlds. The most natural entanglement is between partonic 2-surface and its p-adic
counterpart and has maximum for a unique prime. One expects that this negentropy is expressible
solely in terms of rational and common algebraic points of real and p-adic surfaces and thus using only
the data about real partonic surface. If this entanglement negentropy has a space-time correlate, one
could expect that it is maximum for the same prime and that the geometry of the partonic 2-surface
and perhaps also of corresponding light-like 3-surface and even of a 4-D space-time region reﬂects
this p-adic topology. This prime could characterize the local p-adic topology to which the real region
can be transformed easily (, that is criticality against this kind of transition). This easiness could be
measured by the total number of rational and common algebraic points of the partonic 2-surface if
the transition amplitude is expressible in terms of the information coming from the common points.
Wholes and parts
The basic feature of higher level cognition is formation of wholes from parts. Quantum entangle-
ment between selves representing parts provides an attractive model for this process.
Two types
of entanglements can be considered but negentropic entanglement is highly suggestive in the case
of cognition.
One can wonder whether positive-negative dichotomy for emotions could reﬂect the
negentropic-entropic dichotomy for entanglements. This would conform with the idea that the trans-
formation of negentropic entanglement to bound state entanglement liberates metabolic energy and
information and transforms nutrient to entropic waste. Therefore emotions would not reduce to special
kind of qualia.
Sub-selves represent symbolically the components of conscious experience, say letters of the word:
in absence of entanglement between these ’letter’ selves the sum experience is set of letters whereas
higher level experiences is about average letter. If sub-selves get entangled, there are no sub-self-
experiences and sum-experience is about the word as is also the higher level experience. Understood
word or written language could correspond to a negentropic entanglement between the mental images
representing letters. This entanglement could be also time like and by light-like 3-surfaces connecting
a temporal sequence of causal diamonds.
Entanglement can be also time-like in zero energy ontology and this could relate closely to the
diﬀerences between right and left hemispheres. For right brain hemisphere time-like (and also space-
like) negentropic entanglement could occur in longer time scales than for the left one as the saying right
brain sings-left brain talks and the fact that spatial thinking is associated with the right hemisphere
suggests.
This overall picture will be applied to the modelling of music experience later. The hypothesis will
be also applied to explain paradoxical result of certain experiment testing righ-left brain diﬀerences.
Entanglement and directed attention
Directed attention is one of the basic processes of consciousness occurring continually.
Directed
attention seems to involve free choice but focusing of attention could also occur spontaneously. One
can approach the problem of identifying the physical correlates of directed attention from several
angles.
1. The possibility to interpret self as a statistical ensemble suggests that the entropy of the mental
image measures its fuzziness. Thus both attentiveness, alertness and level of arousal should relate
very closely to the entropy of the mental images. Attention to unentangled mental image could
mean ﬁght against second law to keep the mental image in a low entropy state and this requires
metabolism (the icons on the computer screen provide a good example of this). Negentropic
fusion of mental images would be alternative strategy to keep them alive. Also alertness would
naturally mean negentropic mental images. 7 ± 2 rule of cognitive science suggests that the
maximum number of our cognitive sub-selves which can be awake simultaneously, is rather
limited. The rule might be based on the metabolic limitations: sub-selves can have low entropy
content only in the presence of an external negentropy feed and metabolism must provide the
needed negentropy feed. Note however that the needed metabolic energy might be extremely
low. One could interpret the focused of attention as a wake-up of sub-self and keeping it in

192
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
wake-up state and hence in short term memory. This could occur at the expense of the other
sub-selves, which would be in wake-up state for only short times.
2. One possibility is that subsub-self inside sub-self representing mental image (say ’monitor screen’
as average over subsub-selves representing the visual objects) somehow pops up one level higher
in the self hierarchy so that it becomes mental image. Geometrically this could correspond to
the re-gluing of the corresponding space-time sheet to the space-time sheet of self instead of that
of sub-self. Negentropic entanglement could be in question.
3. Self experiences automatically the sub-systems immediately below it in the hierarchy or perhaps
to the entire collection of mental images. This might however not be what attention is basically.
Rather, attention seems to select one particular mental image and put other mental images to
background. It seems possible to direct attention to lower levels of the self hierarchy than the
one immediately below. For instance, I can direct my attention to the entire sentence, which
I am writing here or to some word of this sentence or to individual letters of this word. The
phenomenon of bio-feedback demonstrates that it is possible to learn to direct the attention
to even single neuron. This suggests that selves are able to modify the hierarchy of selves by
raising some sub...sub-self to the role of sub-self temporarily and thus experience the former
sub...sub-self as a direct mental image.
4. The formation of the ﬂux tubes between mindlike space-time sheets belonging to diﬀerent levels
of the self hierarchy provides a candidate for the geometric correlate of directed attention. A
formation of ﬂux tube connecting partonic 2-surface assignable to self with a partonic 2-surface
assignable to sub-self would be in question. Both the directed character of attention and the
selection of a particular mental image would have clear geometric correlates. The attention to
an object of perceptive ﬁeld would separate the corresponding mental image from the fusion of
mental images. In the case of bound state entanglement this would require the feed of metabolic
energy. In the case of negentropic fusion carrying energy it could liberate metabolic energy.
Anyone can do a simple but thought provoking experiment suggesting the presence of the macro-
scopic quantum entanglement at the level of brain and a change of the level of sub-self in the self
hierarchy. Look at a mirror, direct your attention at your left eye, and redirect the gaze to the right
eye. What you ﬁnd that it is impossible to perceive the change in the direction of the eye gaze.
1. Consider ﬁrst what probably happens when we perceive a moving object. A negentropic binding
of the mental images of the visual ﬁeld to single mental image implies that both the parts and
the whole can be experienced so that the motion is perceived. If the direction of the gaze is
stationary, the object moves relative to the background, and if the direction of the gaze follows
the object the background moves with respect to the direction of gaze. In both cases the motion
can be perceived.
2. If the eye follows its own rotating mirror image, neither of these options is realized if the
environment to which the attention is directed is restricted to be the eye itself. The direction
of the gaze should remain the same in order to perceive the change of the direction of the gaze
but this is impossible.
3. The perceptive ﬁeld however contains also other objects and one could argue that if the attention
is directed also to these simultanenously, it should be possible to perceive the changing direction
of gaze as they move relative to the changing direction of gaze. Does the very act of directing
attention to the mirror image of eye separate it from the negentropic entanglement with the
other mental images so that the conscious comparison with them is not possible anymore? Or is
the visual mental image representing eye at a diﬀerent level of hierarchy from the very beginning
and cannot negentropically entangle with the other visual mental images? Eye cannot perceive
itself! Not even in mirror.
4. This argument raises the question whether it is possible to perceive the the motion of object
if the attention is permanently directed to it?
Is it necessarily to direct the attention only
temporarily to the object and whether the saccadic motion of eyes could relate to this? There
are almost incredible sounding experiments demonstrating that the attention directed intensely
to a ﬁxed object makes it impossible to become aware what happens in environment.

4.3. Quantum self
193
Entanglement and altered states of consciousness
The negentropic entanglement might provide the Royal Road to the understanding of altered states
of consciousness. Entanglement can take place both at the level of self and sub-selves, In the latter
case one can consider the possibility that self can choose in state function reduction whether the
mental images are entangled entropically or negentropically. For self the negentropic entanglement
would be kind of moment of mercy by higher level self. Both space-like and time-like entanglement
are possible and this can lead to transpersonal experiences and memories extending past the own life
time. The entanglement can occur also between diﬀerent number ﬁelds. Also the increases of p-adic
prime or Planck constant could be be involved with these experiences. Clearly, a wide repertoire of
expanded states of consciousness is predicted. This picture conforms with the view that a certain kind
of personal moral and intellectual evolution is a prequisite for enlightment experiences.
Examples of altered states of consciousness are transpersonal experiences and enlightment experi-
ences in which one identiﬁes with some larger consciousness. For instance, prenatal experiences could
result from a time-like negentropic entanglement of a sub-self with self having a temporal extension of
order lifetime or longer and having kind of abstracted experience about the period of life before birth.
Experiences like ”sharing the sorrow of all mothers of dead soldiers” could involve the entanglement of
sub-self with a collective mental image resulting in the entanglement with a collective mental images
having quite concretely as mental images of mothers. If the notion of ﬁeld body having size at least
of order Earth size makes sense, this idea does not look so implausible anymore.
Direct eye contact as an example of quantum entanglement between experiencers?
Direct eye contact is fundamental in the communication between living creatures. The naive intuitive
picture of cartoon drawings about direct eye contact is is as rays connecting the eyes of persons
involved. TGD suggests that this naive picture actually represents fundamental mechanism for the
temporal fusion of selves to form larger selves. What could happen is that join along boundaries bonds
are formed between eyes, and, if the neural window hypothesis holds true, also between brains and
eventually between sensory canvases.
MEs are optimal for this purpose.
The coherent photons associated with them would be the
required macroscopic quantum phase associated with the entire higher level self. Thus it is perhaps
not accident that extended states of consciousness are so often described as experiences about radiance
of light. A weaker hypothesis is that eye contact involves only the formation of join along boundaries
bonds along which classical communication based on propagation of classical signals occurs. Also for
this option MEs are optimal candidates for join along boundaries bonds.
The reader has possibly noticed that these arguments open up the possibility that our visual ﬁeld in
some sense corresponds to the actual visual ﬁeld rather than only its cognitive representation provide
by the visual pathways. The photons arriving along MEs connecting our brain with the objects of the
perceptive ﬁeld could provide the join along boundaries bonds extending our sensory self to contain
part of the external world. Our visual ﬁeld would still be determined by the light entering to our eyes
so that no contradictions with well established empirical facts about vision are encountered. This
kind of extension of visual self could however provide completely new manners for brain to compute
the distances to the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld since the basic information would not be mere
two-dimensional picture in retina. The most plausible option seems to be however the one in which
ultimate sensory representations are realized outside brain at the sensory canvas provided by the
magnetic ﬂux tube structures which can be even of the order of Earth size. This option is discussed
in [K64] .
Semitrance mechanism
The notion of semitrance allows to understand how higher level selves can communicate to and control
and coordinate the behaviour of lower levels selves. If individual contains at least part of time at least
single sub-self, this sub-self can entangle with higher level self and in this trance state can communicate
with the self and possible sub-selves and transmit commands, advices or messages. Communication
is here quite generally understood as a generation of mental images, waking-up of sub-selves, these
sub-selves could be p-adic sub-selves of real selves in accordance with the idea that communication
is part of cognition. The wake-up process initiates self-organization leading to a ﬁnal state pattern

194
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
representing the message. Final state pattern depends only weakly on the stimulus serving as message:
this is as it should be.
The entanglement of the right or left brain hemisphere (or some part of it, perhaps the linguistic
regions with respect to which human brain has highest asymmetry) with a collective self could be
the basic mechanism making it possible to communicate the commands of the collective self to left
and/or right hemisphere as ’hallucinations’. This leads to a TGD variant of the vision of Jaynes about
bicamerals and schizophrenics as persons who diﬀer from the average modern man in that they are
able to receive commands and advice from collective levels of consciousness as hallucinations [J75] .
The notion of semitrance leads to very general views about how various societies (cells as societies
of proteins, organisms as societies of cells, societies of various animals) develop and allows also to
understand various altered states of consciousness [K71, K72] .
The semitrance mechanism involves the generation of a bound state entanglement accompanied
by the liberation of the binding energy as a usable energy. This non-metabolic energy might have
something to do with the miraculous architectural feats of the ancient bicameral cultures (consider
only pyramides) and the unusual physical strength of schizophrenics discussed in [J75] .
Entanglement and sleep
What happens for our self during sleep? One can imagine several alternative answers to the question.
1. We really lose consciousness during sleep. This means that our self entangles negentropically
with some other self. One can however ask why negentropic entanglement should not be possible
and whether it could be the reason for healing eﬀects of sleep.
2. Long term memory representations are not constructed during sleep so that we do not remember
anything about sleep time consciousness except when we wake up from REM sleep: note that
in this case the memories fade rapidly in accordance with the idea that long term memories are
not constructed. Synchronous hippocampal theta is indeed absent during sleep and synchronous
ﬁring would be a natural candidate for both the communications of mental images to magnetic
body and for the generation of memory representations as negentropic fusions of mental images.
If these memory representations are nor formed there is nothing to remember.
3. We are able to remember what happened during sleep only if we are asleep. Perhaps synchronous
theta and delta oscillations are involved with the construction of negentropic memory represen-
tations experienced only during sleep just as theta synchrony is essential for memories about
daytime experiences. The mirror mechanism of long term memories might allow this kind of
possibility. These memory representations would be incomprehensible from the point of day-
time consciousness. The strange mental images experienced just at the verge of falling asleep or
waking up, which have meaning before transition but lose it during the transition, might reﬂect
this.
Irrespective of whether the entanglement is bound state entanglement or negentropic entanglement,
an important function of sleep could be the formation of larger collective selves. During sleep our selves
could entangle to form a kind of a stereo consciousness representing human condition. This process
could involve either phase transition changing local topology or a formation of join along boundaries
contacts with much larger space-time sheets characterized by the same local topology. This mechanism
could make possible subconscious communication between the members of society and also establish
conscience and moral. The topological ﬁeld quanta associated with photons generated by EEG during
sleep have frequency smaller than 7 Hz [K31] . This suggests that the higher level selves in question
correspond to these topological ﬁeld quanta and thus have a wake-up time of order .5 seconds during
delta wave sleep. Mental images would not disappear but would become more abstract during sleep.
4.3.3
General structure of conscious experience
Combining summation hypothesis and the hypothesis about subjective memory one can understand
quite a lot about the phenomenology of consciousness.

4.3. Quantum self
195
Summation hypothesis
Binding of selves by entanglement and summation hypothesis are the basic assumptions about the
structure of contents of consciousness of self. Unentangled sub-system X possessing self behaves essen-
tially as a separate sub-Universe with respect to NMP. This means that unentangled sub-systems Xi
of X, in particular sub-selves, participate in each quantum jump. If one postulates that the conscious
experiences of sub-systems Xi of unentangled sub-system X integrate with the self experience of X
to form single experience, one obtains a ﬁltered hierarchy of conscious experiences with increasingly
richer contents. The integrated experience cannot a simple sum of individual experiences of sub-selves
(we do not experience the conscious experiences of neurons separately). Rather, the experience of X
is most naturally sum of abstractions about experiences of Xi. A natural hypothesis is that X forms
kind of abstraction or average ⟨Xij⟩about the experiences of sub-selves Xij of Xi representing what
it is to be average Xij, that is average over the mental images of Xi.
This kind of mechanism would explain why we do not experience the experiences of individual
neurons, microtubules, DNA:s, etc... as a huge multitude of separate experiences and do note get
drowned to useless information. Combining summation hypothesis with the hypothesis about sub-
jective memory (described in previous section), one can understand self as an object having genuine
extension in subjective time. In particular, it is possible to identify short term memory as a subjective
memory. Also temporal average in geometric sense is possible since mindlike space-time sheets can
have also timelike separation.
A challenge for the hypothesis of self and summation hypothesis is provided by split brain patients
[J19] . It seems that in most serious cases either right or left half dominates the behavior of the
split brain patient and communication between brain hemispheres is lacking. It is known that brain
hemispheres learn to communicate indirectly. Is the hypothesis about summation of the right and
left selves to form mental images of a higher self ireally consistent with the behaviour of split brain
patients?
1. The dominance of either hemisphere is highly analogous to the dominance of a person over an-
other one. The sudden changes of personality can be understood as result of diﬀerent cognitive
specializations of the two hemispheres. The lacking information transfer between hemispheres
explains why right and left brain behave so diﬀerently (to the extend that they can have dif-
ferent future plans!). It is well known that in early childhood hemispheres behave as separate
personalities and certain period in the learning of language seems to involve communication
between brain hemispheres: left hemisphere comments what right hemisphere is doing. This
kind of direct communication usually ceases, when the direct physical connection between brain
hemispheres has developed.
2. One must of course ask what ’dominance’ really means. A possible deﬁnition is based on the
notion of self hierarchy and magnetic body as intentional agent. Magnetic body could direct its
attention in normal circumstances to either left hemisphere or right hemisphere or both if they
are entangled (entropically or negentropically). The unattended hemisphere could be conscious
but would not contribute to the conscious experience of the magnetic body representing us. Cor-
pus callosum- the axon bundle connecting right and left hemisphere- would serve as a natural
correlate for their entanglement, which should be negentropic in the normal situation. Quite
generally, axons would serve as correlates for the entanglement so that also sensory receptors
would be in this sense part of the brain. Note that this would make possible macroscopic quan-
tum coherence between distance parts of body and brain and the regions of quantum coherence
would be highly irregular.
3. The alternating hemisphere dominance characterizes also healthy persons and could provide
magnetic body with three diﬀerent views about world corresponding to hawks and doves and
those between. Problems begin when either hemisphere dominates for too long time. For in-
stance, for schizophrenics the time of dominance is longer than normally. For split brain patients
the absence of physical connection between hemispheres makes impossible quantum entangle-
ment binding the hemispheres together to form single coherent whole and the body of the patient
is inhabited by two persons. The length of time-interval during which given hemisphere con-
tributes to our conscious experience could be rather short. Interestingly, in the case of dolphins
and some birds the second hemisphere sleeps. Is this for metabolic reasons or is the second

196
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
hemisphere entangled with the collective consciousness of the dolphin horde? The theory of bi-
cameral mind assumes that human consciousness before the evolution of language was dominated
by another hemisphere entangled with collective level of consciousness. I have discussed a model
of bicamerality in the earlier formulation of TGD inspired theory of consciousness in [K71, K72]
. One can of course whether that dolphins could represent a modern example about bi-cameral
consciousness.
Self as a statistical ensemble, emotions, and qualia
The sequence of quantum jumps deﬁning self deﬁnes also a sequence of completely unentangled quan-
tum states resulting in the state reduction process governed by NMP. This set of states, which grows
in size quantum jump by quantum jump, deﬁnes in a natural manner a statistical ensemble identiﬁable
as the fundamental realization of the otherwise ﬁctive notion of statistical ensemble fundamental in
the formulation of statistical physics. As far as conscious experience is involved, it seems that it is
the increments of quantum numbers and zero modes which are the relevant statistical variables.
This observation anchors the theory of conscious experience to statistical physics [K28] .
For
instance, the increments of zero modes resp. quantum numbers are responsible for geometric resp.
non-geometric qualia. More precisely, the gradients with respect to subjective time for the zero modes
and for the net quantum numbers associated with selves correspond to qualia. One can classify non-
geometric qualia to kinestetic qualia (sense of pressure and force and, more generally, gradient of any
conserved (with respect to geometric time) quantity associated with self with respect to subjective
time); and generalized chemical qualia (rates for the changes of numbers of particles with various
quantum numbers). Various entropies associated with self and sub-selves in turn characterize the
sharpness of the mental images, and one can relate concepts like attentiveness, alertness and the level
of arousal to these variables.
Statistical aspect could be involved with sensory experiences also in the sense of ensemble averaging.
For instance, various cones of retina are sensitive to diﬀerent wavelength regions (red, green, blue)
and their experiences must correspond to diﬀerent colors.
Therefore our color experience, which
corresponds to average color, should be abstraction about experiences of a small group of retinal cells.
Ensemble averaging could be present in case of sense such as temperature and pressure sense. Also
temporal averaging with respect to geometric time would be made possible by mindlike space-time
sheets and could be present.
The original proposal was that emotions some kind of qualia since also ordinary qualia have the
characteristic black-white dichotomies. What is clear that emotions relate very closely to informa-
tion. For instance, peptides are both informational molecules and molecules of emotion [J102] . This
suggests that positive-negative dichotomy for emotions correlates directly with negentropic-entropic
dichotomy for entanglement. For instance, the neurotransmitters producing positive (negative) emo-
tions would generate negentropic (entropic) entanglement. The fate of the right amygdala would be
a specialization to experience negative emotions by entangling mostly by bound state entanglement
whereas left amygdala specialized to positive emotions would enjoy the negentropic entanglement.
In positive energy ontology it seems impossible to have quantum coherence in human time scales.
The occurrence of 1039 quantum jumps per second probably means that at the lowest level of self
hierarchy corresponding to time scale which is 104 Planck times statistical averaging thermalizes sub-
selves completely so that mental images would contain no information. Decoherence is the physical
counterpart of this process. In zero energy ontology the situation changes. The time scale assignable to
CDassumed to be an octave of CP2 time represents a completely new time scale which is macroscopic
even for elementary particles. This time scale provides a simple estimate for the average increment of
psychological time per quantum jump. For electron and quarks the time scales are .1 seconds and 1
millisecond and correspond to basic time scales of nervous system. The hierarchy of Planck constants
allows to scale up these time scales and makes possible communication using photons with arbitrarily
low wave lengths since large enough Planck constant implies that the energy of photon is above the
thermal threshold. Negentropic entanglement makes possible the formation of completely new kind
of macroscopic quantum systems. Time-like entanglement makes possible fusion of quantum jumps
to longer quantum jumps and thus macrotemporal quantum coherence.
The feed of metabolic energy could destroy entropic entanglement and feed negentropic entangle-
ment as such: for a simple model see [K26] . Interestingly, there is a well-documented disease in which
the patient can live for decades in single frozen moment of consciousness. Is negentropic entanglement

with abnormally large value of Planck constant in question? Or is entropic entanglement with abnor-
mally large binding energy and therefore not possible to destroy by the feed of standard metabolic
energy quanta in question?
Reducible and irreducible selves
Sub-selves correspond to mental images of self. Irreducible selves do not posses sub-selves and have
thus no mental images. The interpretation of this kind of experience -if possible in practice- would be
as a pure awareness without content. Whether this kind of states are really possible is not obvious
since any spacetime sheet contains smaller space-time sheets. When all sub-selves of self fuse (negen-
tropically) together to yield a kind of stereo-consciousness (fusion of left and right visual ﬁelds gives
rise to 3-D stereo vision), something exceptional results also. One might interpret this kind of state
as whole-body consciousness, a state of oneness in very literal sense. Synchronous neuronal ﬁring
could be a signature of this kind of states at neuronal level. Reducible selves have several sub-selves
experienced as mental images. One can model conscious processing as cascades leading to creation
of sub-selves of sub-selves of ... : selves are interpretable as symbolic representations of objects of
sensory experience and a close parallelism with computationalism and connectivism emerges. In zero
energy ontology negentropically entangled zero energy states form this kind of hierarchy.
4.3.4
Basic consequences
Summation hypothesis, when combined with the mechanism for the formation of abstractions and
mechanism of subjective memory, has rather nontrivial consequences.
Inﬁnite hierarchy of selves with God at the top
A rather dramatic prediction is a Russian doll like hierarchy of conscious experiencers having the
entire Universe, God, at the top. The necessary localization in zero modes making the Universe of
conscious experience classical together with the proposed concept of self allows to understand both
active and passive aspects of consciousness and a general classiﬁcation of various types of conscious
experiences becomes possible. Summation hypothesis, sharing of mental images and ’enlightment’ by
the generation of negentropic entanglement hypothesis provide a general framework for interpreting
various transpersonal experiences and altered states of consciousness as resulting from entanglement
with larger units of consciousness.
Self, evolution and, self-organization
Quantum jumps between quantum histories make also possible genuine quantum self-organization.
The concept of self-organization gets quite new additional meaning in TGD framework. Self-organization
means also evolution of self-hierarchies. Self-organization by quantum jumps can be regarded as a
hopping in the zero modes characterizing the macroscopic aspects of the space-time surface. Each self
is a dissipative system which ends up to some asymptotic self-organization pattern in the presence of
the external energy feed (and even without it). Dissipation is the ultimate Darwinian selector picking
up the winning selves as favored self organization patterns. Since sub-selves correspond to mental
images, the immediate implication is that also memes are subject to similar selection. For instance,
the formation of long term memories and habits could be understood as a formation of surviving
sub-selves.
The time evolution by quantum jumps has many facets. One of them relates to eﬀective p-adic
topology and is expected to be of speciall importance if live resides in the intersection of real and
p-adic worlds. Simple arguments leads to the conclusion that evolution for a given space-time sheet
must correspond to a sequence of p-adic primes increasing in a statistical sense. This means that the
concept of nearness deﬁning the eﬀective topology becomes gradually more reﬁned, the complexity
of the universe increases, and the maximal information contents of the conscious experience increase
in the long run (like p × log(p) or at least as log(p) as a function of p-adic prime characterizing
the system). This is nothing but evolution. NMP, which states that entanglement negentropy gain
maximal for allowed quantum jumps, enhances this tendency.
The TGD based realization of the quantum criticality, besides making macroscopic quantum sys-
tems possible, in a well-deﬁned sense maximizes the intelligence and complexity of the universe [K14] .

198
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
In biosystems a concrete realization of quantum criticality is in terms of magnetic ﬂux tube structures
and electret type space-time sheets representing solutions of ﬁeld equations dual to each other and
having opposite signs of K¨ahler action density.
TGD universe is quantum spin glass and this adds additional aspect to the self-organization process.
For instance, the energy landscape of the spin glass is fractal like structure containing valleys inside
valleys and provides an ideal dynamical memory mechanism. Spin glass degeneracy also provides a
mechanism increasing the lifetimes of the bound states formed by join along boundaries condensates
and thus could allow macrotemporally quantum coherent states able to perform quantum computation
like activities. The impossibility of macrotemporal quantum coherence is indeed the main objection
against quantum theories of consciousness.
This looks nice but one can ask whether the framework of standard quantum theory is all that is
needed to formulate quantum TGD and the notion of quantum criticality. The original motivations
for introducing the hierarchy of Planck constants and the generalization of the imbedding space to a
book like structure having as pages the almost copies of the imbedding space were purely physical.
Now it seems that this generalization is required by a need to have a proper formulation of quantum
criticality of TGD Universe. The hierarchy of Planck constants leads to a whole bundle of ideas about
quantum biology and evolution of consciousness and also to a detailed model for how living matter
can perform topological quantum computation like activities [K4, K23, K26, K2] .
State function reduction reducing entanglement is a random process unlike that producing negen-
tropic entanglement and implies quantum decoherence. Therefore the unentangled sub-selves of self
deﬁne a statistical ensemble in a natural manner and dissipation is naturally related to the ageing of
self since the statistical ensemble in question grows quantum jump by quantum jump. The averaging
over quantum jumps means that the contents of consciousness of self thermalize with mental images
becoming more and more fuzzy.
Haken’s classical theory of self-organization applies almost as such if only entropic entanglement is
considered since time development by quantum jumps means hopping around the space of zero modes
characterizing the size and shape and induced K¨ahler ﬁelds associated with the space-time surface
X4(X3). Negentropic entanglement of mental images changes however the situation in time scale
which could be the time scale assignable to the CDs associated with the entangled selves.
Self-organization involves Darwinian selection performed by dissipation inside each self. Dissipa-
tion selects also surviving sub-selves having interpretation as mental images. Hence the selection of
memes is also in question.
Subjective ageing results from dissipation and is the price paid for having autonomous self sepa-
rated from environment. Very concretely, the mental image of self represented by sub-self gets more
and more entropic during ageing. One can also formulate questions about what happens in death in
terms of physical concepts. Does only the bodily sub-self (mental image about body) cease to exist in
the physical death so that only the ﬁeld body consisting of magnetic ﬂux tube structures and massless
extremals (MEs, topological counterparts of light rays) remains? Can one identify the ﬁeld body as
the counterpart of what is called soul? Could the ﬁeld body get interested of some new biological
body and use it as sensory and motor organ (re-incarnation)? Is entanglement with some larger self
generated after death (and during sleep)? Or does only the crucial p-adic-to-real phase transition for
MEs (say) representing the transformation of intentions to actions cease during sleep and in death so
that neither sensory mental images nor memories are formed but consciousness might still continue?
Quantum model for intelligent system
The concept of self provides justiﬁcation for the assumptions behind the quantum model for intelligent
systems [K14] . One can understand at very general level the mechanism for how universe forms
abstractions about itself. Even the basic hierarchical structures of language could be identiﬁed in terms
of Russian doll like structure formed by selves with phonemes possibly representing the lowest level
selves in case of language. The possibility of negentropic entanglement possible in the intersection of
real and p-adic worlds is perhaps the most important new element and makes possible the identiﬁcation
of quantum correlates of rules and abstractions. This kind of pairs formed by quantum states belonging
to diﬀerent number ﬁelds would deﬁned cognitive from real world to symbolic representtions and
between symbolic representations. The time-like negentropic entanglement in fermionic degrees of
freedom is possible only within given number ﬁeld and would provide a natural representation for a
Boolean rule A →B with paired instances of A and B represented by state pairs.

4.3. Quantum self
199
The close connection with the computationalistic approach to psychology and consciousness is ob-
vious. The hierarchy of selves is analogous to a hierarchy of higher level computer languages. Note also
the analogy with the the hierarchy of the modules of a computer program. Selves could be interpreted
as symbolic representations for the objects of external (and internal) world and cascades of selves
generating selves inside selves provide a model for sensory experience and cognition. This model pro-
vides also a possible representation for logical implication sequences as temporally ordered sequences
generating sub-selves.
Negentropic quantum entanglement between selves is a good candidate for
representing how wholes are formed from parts consciously as also for the formation of associations.
Abstraction process emerges naturally as a formation of quantum average selves about the sub-sub-
selves of self. Zero energy ontology is ideal for construction of hierarchies as negentropically entangled
states formed from zero energy states formed from....
Quantum statistical determinism makes possible reliable thinking and sensory experiencing at the
level of self and one could in principle model brain and sensory organs as ensembles of sub-sub-
systems for which quantum measurement of certain observables occurs in quantum jump leading to
the thought or sensory experience [K14] . For negentropic entanglement the outcome of the state
function reduction is rather deterministic but U process can generate ensemble since one can obtain
from a given negentropically entangled state new ones by permuting the entangled state pairs. This
kind of transformation makes possible to realize quantum computations using negentropic qubits
formed by entangled positive and negative energy parts of the state [K44] .
Biological quantum
computation could be rely on this kind of fuzzy qubits and the model of DNA as a topological
quantum computer [K23] can be formulated in terms of negentropic qubits. What is especially nice
is that temporal statistical averages become possible since mindlike space-time sheets can have also
timelike distance: thus individual can learn form experience if temporal ensemble of cognitive space-
time sheets is available.
Self as a moral agent
There are many manners to interpret evolution in TGD Universe.
1. p-Adic evolution would mean a gradual increase of the inﬁnite p-adic prime characterizing the
entire universe implying the gradual increase of p-adic primes characterizing individual partonic
2-surfaces and therefore their size. The identiﬁcation of p-adic space-time sheets as representa-
tions for intentions and the identiﬁcation of p-adic-to-real phase transitions as transformations
of intentions to real actions gives additional concreteness to this vision.
2. The hierarchy of Planck constants suggests evolution as the gradual increase of the Planck
constant characterizing p-adic space-time sheet (or partonic 2-surface for the minimal option).
This evolution could be seen as a migration to the pages of the book like structure deﬁned by
the generalized imbedding space and has therefore quite concrete geometric meaning. It implies
longer time scales of long term memory and planned action and macroscopic quantum coherence
in longer scales.
3. The vision about life as something in the intersection of real and p-adic words allows to see
evolution information theoretically as the increase of number entanglement negentropy implying
entanglement in increasing length scales.
This option is consistent with the ﬁrst one if the
eﬀective p-adic topology characterizes the real partonic 2-surfaces in the intersection of p-adic
and real worlds. The singular coverings of CD s and CP2 are characterized by an Abelian group
Zn permuting the sheets of the covering and corresponds naturally to powers of the (quantum)
phase q = exp(i2π/n) allowing to deﬁne the notion of angle in p-adic context but only with a
ﬁnite resolution since only ﬁnite number of angles are represented as phases for a given value
of n. The increase of the integers n could be interpreted as the emergence of higher algebraic
extensions of p-adic numbers in the intersection of the real and p-adic worlds. These observations
suggest that all three views about evolution are closely related.
The third kind of evolution would mean also the evolution of spiritual consciousness if the pro-
posed interpretation is correct. In each quantum jump U-process generates a superposition of states in
which any sub-system can have both real and algebraic entanglement with the external world. If state
function redution process involves also the choice of the type of entanglement it could be interpreted

200
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
as a choice between good and evil. The hedonistic complete freedom resulting as the entanglement
entropy is reduced to zero on one hand, and the algebraic bound state entanglement implying cor-
relations with the external world and meaning giving up the maximal freedom on the other hand.
The selﬁsh option has the risk of leading to non-algebraic bound state entanglement implying a loss
of consciousness: death as the prize of sin. The second option means expansion of consciousness - a
fusion to the ocean of consciousness as described by spiritual practices.
In this framework one could therefore understand the physics correlates of ethics and moral. The
ethics is simple: evolution of consciousness to higher levels is a good thing. Anything which tends to
reduce consciousness represents violence and is a bad thing. Moral rules are related to the relationship
between indvidual and society and presumably develop via self-organization process and are by no
means unique. Moral rules however tend to optimize evolution. As blind normative rules they can
however become a source of violence identiﬁed as any action which reduces the level of consciousness.
There is an entire hierarchy of selves and every self has the selﬁsh desire to survive and moral
rules develop as a kind of compromise and evolve all the time. The newest progress in this evolution
is brought by the cosmology of consciousness, which forces to extend the concept of society to four-
dimensional society! The decisions of ”me now” aﬀect both my past and future and time like quantum
entanglement makes possible conscious communication in time direction by sharing conscious experi-
ences. One can therefore speak of genuinely four-dimensional society. Besides my next-door neighbors
I had better to take into account also my nearest neighbors in past and future (the nearest ones being
perhaps copies of me!). If I make wrong decisions those copies of me in future and past will suﬀer the
most. Perhaps my personal hell and paradise are here and are created mostly by me.
Selves can make plans since they have 4-dimensional geometric memory (conscious experience
contains information about a four-dimensional space-time region, rather than only time=constant
snapshot, and gives rise to a ”prophecy”, a prediction for the future and past, which would be reliable
if the world were completely classical). As a matter fact, it is p-adic space-time sheets which correspond
to intentions and plans and act of volition transforms p-adic space-time sheet to a real one. Selves can
make decisions and select between various classical macroscopic time developments. Selves are able
to remember their choices since they have subjective memories about the previous quantum jumps.
Thus selves are genuine moral agents.
Self, psychological time and its arrow
There are many diﬃcult questions related to the relationship between subjective and geometric time.
How the arrow of subjective time is mapped to the arrow of geometric time? How to understand the
sharp distinction between geometric future and past at the level of conscious experience? What is
the average interval of geometric time assignable to quantum jump and how it depends on the p-adic
prime p characterizing system and on the value of Planck constant? Can one assign to quantum jumps
space-time region about which the contents of conscious experience are, and how the temporal and
spatial scales of this region depend on p and the value of Planck constant?
The emergence of zero energy ontology and hierarchy of Planck constants provides to my opinion
the most convincing answers to these questions found hitherto.
1. Zero energy state is identiﬁable in positive energy ontology as a physical event, say elementary
particle scattering such that positive and negative energy parts of the state correspond to the
initial and ﬁnal states of the event. The geometric correlate is a causal diamond formed by a
pair of future and past directed light-cones of M 4 and corresponds to a region of the imbedding
space rather than that of space-time.
2. The temporal distance T between the tips of the causal diamond brings to physics a new time
scale and simple argument predicts p-adic length scale hypothesis (favored primes p satisfy
p ≃2k, k prime), and that T corresponds to secondary p-adic time scale T2,p = √pTp. For
nonstandard values of ℏT scales like ℏ/ℏ0. In the case of zero energy state describing electron
this time scale is .1 seconds and corresponds to the 10 Hz frequency deﬁning the fundamental
biorhythm, and the duration of moment of sensory experience.
3. The simplest explanation for the arrow of geometric time assumes that the attention of self is
directed to a ﬁxed volume of imbedding space deﬁned by the causal diamond. In other words,
self has this causal diamond as a geometric correlate at imbedding spave level besides space-time

4.3. Quantum self
201
sheet (actually partonic 2-surfaces at the light-like boundaries of CD serving as a space-time
correlate. The conscious experience of self is about space-time sheets inside this CD and its
sub-CDs.
4. If the quantum superposition of space-time surfaces in the ﬁrst approximation shifts in a given
quantum jump to the direction of geometric past a distance given by T, the arrow of geometric
time can be understood and T deﬁnes the lapse of geometric time in quantum jump.
The
hierarchy of quantum jumps inside quantum jumps corresponds to both p-adic and ℏhierarchies
and the experience of ﬂow of time can be understood in terms of sequences of sub-quantum
jumps deﬁning mental images. A more precise formulation allows also to understand why sensory
experience is about narrow time interval. The absolutely essential element of this explanation is
the representability of the space-time as a 4-D surface of a higher-dimensional imbedding space,
multi-verse picture and quantum coherence in macroscopic scales, as well as the assignment of
unique space-time surface to given 3-surface required by General Coordinate Invariance. The
original deﬁning assumptions relate to the notion of self can be assumed to hold true for sub-
selves identiﬁed as sub-quantum jumps.
5. There is arrow of geometric time emerges also at the level of the imbedding space. CDs are
characterized by their temporal size scale coming as powers of two and quantum jump sequences
induces diﬀusion of CD in the moduli space of CDs leading to the increase of this size. There is
a strong analogy with cosmic time and a natural proposal is that the quantum counterpart for
cosmic time correspond to this kind of parameter for a very large CD. The relative positions of
the of tips deﬁne part of the moduli space of CD and this space could be discrete and correspond
to a union of lattice assignable to cosmic time constant hyperboloidsa having subgroup of Lorentz
groups as symmetry group. This would predict quantization of redshifts in cosmology.
Space-time as a 4-dimensional living being
The new concept of the psychological time means a dramatic generalization of the standard view
about subjective existence. mindlike space-time sheets are distributed everywhere around material
space-time sheets of inﬁnite time duration and all of them can participate in a given quantum jump.
Therefore one can say that the entire space-time is a conscious, living being. Civilizations of the
geometric past and future exist simultaneously with us.
We are members of a four-dimensional
society in the sense that our actions aﬀect the life of selves of both geometric past and future since
each quantum jump performed by us changes the macroscopic space-time in both past and future.
Everyday experience suggest that the geometric past is relatively rigid. Although changes in a
given time scale can occur below some length scale, changes in larger scales are probably rare. Sensory
representations could however change and this could explain the instability of long term memories.
Turning point decisions are probably not possible for the me of my geometric past: otherwise dramatic
quantum jump changing completely my personal identity would occur.
The notion of the four-dimensional body (both material and ﬁeld bodies) becomes natural and
only the concentration of consciousness to the psychological now during the physical life creates the
illusion that the reality corresponds to the time=constant snapshot of the time evolution. Near death
experiences indeed support the view that life is experienced as a temporal whole when the dominating
contribution from the p-adic-to-real phase transitions and sensory input is absent.
4-dimensional
body is not static but changes quantum jump by quantum jump which suggests that life is like a
four-dimensional sculpture which is gradually reﬁned. We in our youth now experience in slightly
more deeper manner and live in a society having slightly higher level of moral. Note that the newest
view about arrow of time means that the creation of this 4-D sculpture can be also seen as classical
time evolution in the ﬁrst approximation.
4.3.5
Can one choose between the two variants for the notion of self or are
they equivalent?
I have considered two diﬀerent notions of ”self” and it is interesting to see whether the new view
about time might allow to choose between them or to show that they are actually equivalent.

202
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
1. In the original variant of the theory ”self” corresponds to a sequence of quantum jumps. ”Self”
would result through a binding of quantum jumps to single ”string” in close analogy and actually
in a concrete correspondence with the formation of bound states. Each quantum jump has a
fractal structure: unitary process is followed by a sequence of state function reductions and
preparations proceeding from long to short scales. Selves can have sub-selves and one has self
hierarchy. The questionable assumption is that self remains conscious only as long as it is able
to avoid entanglement with environment.
Even slightest entanglement would destroy self unless on introduces the notion of ﬁnite measure-
ment resolution applying also to entanglement. This notion is indeed central for entire quantum
TGD also leads to the notion of sharing of mental images: selves unentangled in the given mea-
surement resolution can experience shared mental images resulting as fusion of sub-selves by
entanglement not visible in the resolution used.
2. According to the newer variant of theory, quantum jump has a fractal structure so that there are
quantum jumps within quantum jumps: this hierarchy of quantum jumps within quantum jumps
would correspond to the hierarchy of dark matters labeled by the values of Planck constant.
Each fractal structure of this kind would have highest level (largest Planck constant) and this
level would corresponds to the self. What might be called irreducible self would corresponds
to a quantum jump without any sub-quantum jumps (no mental images). The quantum jump
sequence for lower levels of dark matter hierarchy would create the experience of ﬂow of subjective
time.
It would be nice to reduce the original notion of self hierarchy to the hierarchy deﬁned by quantum
jumps. There are some objections against this idea. One can argue that fractality is a purely geometric
notion and since subjective experience does not reduce to the geometry it might be that the notion of
fractal quantum jump does not make sense. It is also not quite clear whether the reasonable looking
idea about the role of entanglement as destroyer of self can be kept in the fractal picture.
These objections fail if one can construct a well-deﬁned mathematical scheme allowing to under-
stand what fractality of quantum jump at the level of space-time correlates means and showing that
the two views about self are equivalent. The following argument represents such a proposal. Let us
start from the causal diamond model as a lowest approximation for a model of zero energy states and
for the space-time region deﬁning the contents of sensory experience.
Let us make the following assumptions.
1. Assume the hierarchy of causal diamonds within causal diamonds in a sense to be speciﬁed more
precisely below. Causal diamonds would represent the volumes of attention. Assume that the
highest level in this hierarchy deﬁnes the quantum jump containing sequences of lower level
quantum jumps in some sense to be speciﬁed. Assume that these quantum jumps integrate
to single continuous stream of consciousness as long as the sub...-sub-self in question remains
unentangled and that entangling means loss of consciousness or at least that it is not possible
to remember anything about contents of consciousness during entangled state.
2. Assume that the contents of conscious experience come from the interior of the causal diamond.
A stronger condition would be that the contents come from the boundaries of the two light-cones
involved since physical states are deﬁned at these in the simplest picture. In this case one could
identify the lower light-cone boundary as giving rise to memory.
3. The time span characterizing the contents of conscious experience associated with a given quan-
tum jump would correspond to the temporal distance T between the tips of the causal diamond.
T would also characterize the average and approximate shift of the superposition of space-time
surfaces backwards in geometric time in single quantum jump at a given level of hierarchy. This
time scale naturally scales as Tn = 2nTCP2 so that p-adic length scale hypothesis follows as a con-
sequence. T would be essentially the secondary p-adic time scale T2,p = √pTp for p ≃2k. This
assumption - absolutely essential for the hierarchy of quantum jumps within quantum jumps -
would diﬀerentiate the model from the model in which T corresponds to either CP2 time scale
or p-adic time scale Tp. One would have hierarchy of quantum jumps with increasingly longer
time span for memory and with increasing duration of geometric chronon at the highest level of
fractal quantum jump. Without additional restrictions, the quantum jump at nth level would

4.3. Quantum self
203
contain 2n quantum jumps at the lowest level of hierarchy. Note that in the case of sub-self - and
without further assumptions which will be discussed next - one would have just two quantum
jumps: mental image appears, disappears or exists all the time. At the level of sub-sub-selves
four quantum jumps and so on. Maybe this kind of simple predictions might be testable.
4. We know that that the contents of sensory experience comes from a rather narrow time interval
of duration about .1 seconds, which corresponds to the time scale T127 associated with electron.
We also know that there is asymmetry between positive and negative energy parts of zero energy
states both physically and at the level of conscious experience. This asymmetry must have some
space-time correlate. The simplest correlate for the asymmetry between positive and negative
energy states would be that the upper light-like boundaries in the structure formed by light-
cones within light-cones intersect along light-like radial geodesic.
No condition of this kind
would be posed on lower light-cone boundaries. The scaling invariance of this condition makes
it attractive mathematically and would mean that arbitrarily long time scales Tn can be present
in the fractal hierarchy of light cones. At all levels of the hierarchy all contribution from upper
boundary of the causal diamond to the conscious experience would come from boundary of same
past directed light-cone so that the conscious experience would be sharply localized in time in
the manner as we know it to be. The new element would be that content of conscious experience
would come from arbitrarily large region of Universe and seing Milky Way would mean direct
sensory contact with it.
5. These assumptions relate the hierarchy of quantum jumps to p-adic hierarchy. One can also
include also dark matter hierarchy into the picture. For dark matter hierarchy the time scale
hierarchy {Tn} is scaled by the factor r = ℏ/ℏ0 which can be also rational number. For r = 2k
the hierarchy of causal diamonds generalizes without diﬃculty and there is a kind of resonance
involved which might relate to the fact that the model of EEG favors the values of k = 11n,
where k = 11 also corresponds in good approximation to proton-electron mass ratio. For more
general values of ℏ/ℏ0 the generalization is possible assuming that the position of the upper tip
of causal diamond is chosen in such a manner that their positions are always the same whereas
the position of the lower light-cone boundary would correspond to {rTn} for given value of
Planck constant. Geometrically this picture generalizes the original idea about fractal hierarchy
of quantum jumps so that it contains both p-adic hierarchy and hierarchy of Planck constants.
The contributions from lower the boundaries identiﬁable in terms of memories would correspond to
diﬀerent time scales and for a given value of time scale T the net contribution to conscious experience
would be much weaker than the sensory input in general. The asymmetry between geometric now
and geometric past would be present for all contributions to conscious experience, not only sensory
ones. What is nice that the contents of conscious experience would rather literally come from the
boundary of the past directed light-cone along which the classical signals arrive. Hence the mystic
feeling about telepathic connection with a distant object at distance of billions of light years expressed
by an astrophysicist, whose name I have unfortunately forgotten, would not be romantic self deception.
This framework explains also the sharp distinction between geometric future and past (not surpris-
ingly since energy and time are dual): this distinction has also been a long standing problem of TGD
inspired theory of consciousness. Precognition is not possible unless one assumes that communications
and sharing of mental images between selves inside disjoint causal diamonds is possible. Physically
there seems to be no good reason to exclude the interaction between zero energy states associated
with disjoint causal diamonds.
The mathematical formulation of this intuition is however a non-trivial challenge and can be used
to articulate more precisely the views about what conﬁguration space and conﬁguration space spinor
ﬁelds actually are mathematically.
1. Suppose that the causal diamonds with tips at diﬀerent points of H = M 4 ×CP2 and character-
ized by distance between tips T deﬁne sectors CHi of the full conﬁguration space CH (”world
of classical worlds”). Precognition would represent an interaction between zero energy states
associated with diﬀerent sectors CHi in this scheme and tensor factor description is required.
2. Inside given sector CHi it is not possible to speak about second quantization since every quantum
state correspond to a single mode of a classical spinor ﬁeld deﬁned in that sector.

204
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
3. The question is thus whether the Cliﬀord algebras and zero energy states associated with diﬀerent
sectors CHi combine to form a tensor product so that these zero energy states can interact.
Tensor product is required by the vision about zero energy insertions assignable to CHi which
correspond to causal diamonds inside causal diamonds. Also the assumption that zero energy
states form an ensemble in 4-D sense - crucial for the deduction of scattering rates from M-matrix
- requires tensor product.
4. The argument unifying the two deﬁnitions of self requires that the tensor product is restricted
when CHi correspond to causal diamonds inside each other. The tensor factors in shorter time
scales are restricted to the causal diamonds hanging from a light-like radial ray at the upper end
of the common past directed light-cone. If the causal diamonds are disjoint there is no obvious
restriction to be posed, and this would mean the possibility of also precognition and sharing of
mental images.
This scenario allows also to answers the questions related to a more precise deﬁnition of volume of
attention. Causal diamond - or rather - the associated light-like boundaries containing positive and
negative energy states deﬁne the primitive volume of attention. The obvious question whether the
attention of a given self is doomed to be ﬁxed to a ﬁxed volume can be also answered. This is not
the case. Selves can delocalize in the sense that there is a wave function associated with the position
of the causal diamond and quantum jumps changing this position are possible. Also many-particle
states assignable to a union of several causal diamonds are possible. Note that the identiﬁcation of
magnetic ﬂux tubes as space-time correlates of directed attention in TGD inspired quantum biology
makes sense if these ﬂux tubes connect diﬀerent causal diamonds. The directedness of attention in
this sense should be also understood: it could be induced from the ordering of p-adic primes and
Planck constant: directed attention would be always from longer to shorter scale.

Some applications at brain level
In this section the notion of self and related notions are applied to brain at general level. Due to the
introduction of the notion of negentropic entanglement the representation diﬀers from the earlier one
decisively.
4.4.1
A simple model for cognition
The hierarchy of selves and summation hypothesis allows to construct a very general model for cog-
nitive processes including as a special case thinking, analysis of visual experience, and language. In
nutshell: cognitive process could be regarded as cascade like process leading to a generation of selves
followed by generation of sub-selves for these leading to... . Quantum jump becomes the building
block of cognition and thought but is not suﬃcient alone.
p-Adic space-time sheets as correlates
of cognition provide geometric correlates for thoughts, intentions, plans, etc..
are a fundamental
element of cognition. The intersection of real and p-adic worlds understood as partonic 2-surfaces
allowing an interpretation in both real and p-adic sense and the intersections of real and p-adic par-
tonic 2-surfaces consisting of rational and common algebraic points deﬁne cognitive representations.
Negentropic entanglement is possible only in the intersection in accordance with with the vision that
cognitive representations carry the information.
Quantum criticality of TGD and existence of selves
The model of cognition provides a new view to the role of quantum criticality of TGD. One consequence
of the quantum criticality could be the existence of a lot of sub-systems which are near the critical
line at which phase transition changing the local topology (real or p-adic) occurs. TGD universe
would be in a state of maximal alertness ready to generate cascades of selves representing cognitive
acts. Our cognitive acts would be only part of the cognitive acts of the entire Universe proceeding
from top to bottom as inﬁnite trees with branches representing new selves and nodes representing
moments of wake-ups for the selves. Or expressing it in the terminology of AI: we would be like
subprograms of inﬁnite program represented by entire universe. The presence of higher level selves
means that cognitive acts can proceed from the level of even entire biosystem to the level of DNA.

4.4. Some applications at brain level
205
This encourages to interesting speculations: for instance, the ideas of Sheldrake about learning at the
level of species and even biosphere might ﬁnd justiﬁcation [K69] .
Number theoretical criticality is an important aspect of quantum criticality and is taken to mean
that life and conscious intelligence reside in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds, where discrete
cognitive representations and transformation of intention to action and vice versa are possible.
Quantum jump as cognitive process
U process followed by a cascade of state function reductions will be identiﬁed as the basic cognitive
act.
1. State function reduction can be characterized as a binary tree. At each step of the state function
reduction cascade some subselves manage to remain unentangled, some subselves lose their
consciousness by developing entropic bound state entanglement, or experience expansion of
consciousness by entangling negentropically. A particular branch of the process stops if subself
allows no decomposition to entropically entangled but otherwise free pieces. What is new is
that the entanglement is also time-like and time-like entanglement turns out to be central for
understanding of what happens in learning.
2. The binary tree of state function reduction has a natural ordering.
This ordering need not
have any correlate at the level of geometric time. At the level of subjective time and conscious
experience the correlate for ordering could exist but if self experiences its subselves as averages of
sub-sub-selves this cascade is experienced only partially by given subself. One can of course argue
that self wakes up in each quantum jump separately and quantum jump sequence should be seen
as a sequence of ”awakenings” (I used this term earlier): this awakening is however something
diﬀerent from the emergence of mental image. Maybe time-like negentropic entanglement is
which binds this sequence of ”awakenings” to a continuous stream of consciousness that we
experience.
3. The outcome of the state function reduction is random when it leads to un-entangled subself
but statistical determinism implies reliability at the level of ensemble. For negentropic entan-
glement state function reduction is nearly deterministic process and in this case one can speak
in reasonable approximation about an iteration of a unitary processes deﬁned by the powers of
U. This iterative process deﬁnes a self-organization process expected to be also behind learning.
4. One possible interpretation of the self cascade is as a representation for an abstraction process
representing thoughts about thoughts about... Our poor ability to form statements about state-
ments about ... would correspond to the fact that self experiences only its sub-selves directly.
Another interpretation is as analysis, in which initial experience gradually sharpens and gets
more and more structured during the decomposition into sub-selves. Sub-selves could be thought
as symbols of language or as logical statements or objects in picture: interpretation depends on
what kind of cognitive process is in question. This process occurs in several time scales- even
in the time scale deﬁned by human life cycle. The modular structure of cognitive acts is also
analogous to the modular structure of a computer program: starting of subprogram means the
reduction of entanglement for the corresponding subsystem.
One can see this process also at the level of imbedding space correlates.
1. Selves wake up and begin to perform quantum jumps. The imbedding space counterpart for
self is CD (causal diamond) characterized by time scale coming as powers of two and is scaling
like the value of Planck constant. Subselves correspond to sub-CDs. Wake-up requires a feed
of metabolic energy to destroy the bound state entanglement. Self could be also created from
vacuum or disappear to it in a quantum jump generating a completely new CD or annihilating
it.
2. Cognitive process proceeds in a cascade like manner starting from the root of tree formed by
CDs and going downwards along the tree choosing at each node some branches. For instance,
understanding of a sentence would correspond to waking up of large self A representing sentence
in its entirety, words its sub-selves Bi, phonemes to sub-selves Cij of Bi, etc... waking-up in this

206
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
order. Similarly, the act of decomposing the ﬁgure to objects and of objects to sub-objects would
correspond to a temporal sequence generating selves within selves. Negentropic entanglement
would be crucial for experiencing both the whole and the parts simultaneously. Background
would be the largest conscious self and objects would correspond to a sequence of selves. Selves
Cij and further sub-selves can be generated before generation of next Ci+1: this should occur
in case linguistic mental image: generation of word self would be followed by the generation of
syllables and phonemes and only after this would next word be generated. Time nonlocality of
self experience with respect to geometric and subjective time would be essential.
4.4.2
Cognition, learning, and negentropic entanglement at the level of
brain
Negentropic entanglement is information carrier and learning is gaining information. Does this mean
that learning takes place automatically in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds? Unitary U-matrix
between zero energy states characterizes single step of quantum jump sequences and for negentropic
states the state function reduction is not random process and in the ﬁrst approximation U N charac-
terizes the outcome of N subsequent quantum jump so that learning process should be characterized
by the iteration deﬁned by the powers of U.
In neuroscience synaptic contacts are believed to be crucial for cognition, learning, and memory
and it is interesting to try to relate this picture to the TGD based vision about conscious information
and learning. How negentropic entanglement could be realized at the level of brain? Is it time-like,
space-like, or both?
Can one assign the generation of negentropic entanglement between neurons
to the attachement of neurotransmitter to receptor? Can one relate the general quantum model of
learning to the neuroscience based model of learning relying on the growth of brain cells, synaptic
contacts, and synaptic plasticity?
The picture of the standard neuroscience about learning
It is good to summarize ﬁrst the vision of standard neuroscience about the neural correlates of learning.
1. Basic notions
Synaptic transmission [J9, J22] is believed to be a key element of brain consciousness. Synaptic
transmission takes place as synaptic vesicles carrying neural transmitter. Given neuron can release
several transmitters. The transmitter molecules bind to the receptors at the postsynaptic cell mem-
brane. Depending on whether this process leads to a depolarization or hyper-polarization one speaks
of excitatory or inhibitory receptors (activation potentials). Since most transmitters attach mostly to
either kind of receptor, one speaks about excitatory and inhibitory transmitters although this termi-
nology is misleading. Receptors can be classiﬁed to relatively simple ion channel receptors and more
complex receptors involving second messenger proteins.
The belief is that the primary process does not involve communications with genome but if one
accepts the DNA as topological quantum computer picture-in particular, on the existence of magnetic
ﬂux tubes connecting cell membrane and DNA nucleotides- the possibility that these communications
are an essential element of process and that a new kind of gene expression at cell membrane level
is involved. The communication to the DNA could take with light velocity if massless extremals are
involved.
The synaptic strength characterizes the sensitivity of the postsynaptic neuron to the ﬁring of the
presynaptic neuron. It depends on the density of receptors and their activity as well as the total
amount of neural transmitter transferred between neurons determined by the number of synaptic
vesicles transmitted. This in turn depends on the size of the synaptic button. All these parameters
are aﬀected in learning understood as a change of synaptic strengths. It must be emphasized that
learning in this sense should be seen as a neural correlate for conscious (or unconscious-to-us) learning
and possibly of memory. What is essential that the respose of the postsynaptic neuron changes. This
picture relies on the technical assumption that learning reduces to the changes of synaptic strengths.
This assumption is probably an over-idealization: much more probably happens.
2. Learning at brain level

4.4. Some applications at brain level
207
Learning in the sense as it is deﬁned above can take place at the level of both anatomy and
physiology. Learning at the level of anatomy can mean growth of new synaptic connections and of
even new neurons. For instance, the growth of new neurons in hippocampus is now understood to
be essential prerequisite for learning. It is believed that the information from the connections of old
neurons is transferred to those of cortical neurons. This can of course happen but in TGD framework
this is not necessary since the new view about time allows to interpret memory as communications
with the brain of the geometric past.
Learning at the level of physiology is known as synaptic plasticity [J20] and involves several mech-
anisms. Synaptic plasticity means that the sensitivity of the postsynaptic neuron to the signals from
presynaptic neuron can change.
1. Sensivity means essentially the probability for the ﬁring as a response to the ﬁring of presynap-
tic neuron and this is controlled by the sign and magnitude of the activation potential and the
increase of the sensitivity means a generation of stronger depolarization or weaker hyperpolariza-
tion. Postsynaptic neuron can become more or less sensitive to the presynaptic neuron whereas
presynaptic neuron can send stronger signal by increasing the number of synaptic vesicles.
2. The change of the sensitivity of the postsynaptic neuron can take place several mechanisms [J20]
.
(a) The ﬁrst mechanism involves the modiﬁcation of protein kinases whose function is to phos-
phorylate the receptor which means essentially providing it with metabolic energy. The
eﬀectiveness of the protein kinases is regulated.
Second mechanism depends on second
messenger neurotransmitters regulating gene transcription and regulates the levels of key
proteins at synapses. Gene expression is aﬀected in this mechanism and the eﬀect is long-
lasting.
(b) Third mechanism aﬀects the number of ion channels (ion transfer between cell interior and
exterior is basically responsible for the activation potential) and is involved with long term
potentiation (LTP [J13] ) and - depression (LTD [J12] ) believed to be central mechanisms
of learning memory. LTP is believed to be of central importance in hippocampus. The
change of the density of receptors is one manner to achieve LPT or LTD. For so so called
AMPA receptors [J4] to which glutamate binds this mechanism is well-established. Also
phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors and change in the probability
of glutamate release is a decisive factor.
3. The notion of Hebbian learning [J10] applies to LTP. Hebbian rules summarizes the above
picture as simple mathematical rules allowing computer modelling.
When pre-synaptic and
postsynaptic neurons ﬁre simultaneously, synaptic connections are aﬀected. Weak stimulations
of several pathways add up. Also temporal summation takes place if the frequency of ﬁring
is high enough. Strong stimulation of one pathway aﬀects also other pathways. More general
formulation of the rules does not require the ﬁring of the postsynaptic neuron. For anti-Hebbian
learning de-sensitization takes place. Also non-Hebbian learning is believed to take place.
4. The change of the postsynaptic action potential need not be the only outcome of learning. If this
were the case, the huge number of neural transmitters and receptors inducing diﬀerent responses
would not be needed. The change of the sensitivity is only one aspect of learning and as its
relationship to conscious learning is unclear.
TGD based vision about cognition and learning
In the following a brief summary about TGD inspired view concerning cognition and learning in
general and at brain level is given.
1. Basic ideas
The general ideas about cognition have been also discussed but is useful to summarize them again.
1. Subself interpreted as a mental image is key notion. Subselves wake-up, fall asleep, and fuse
together losing consciousness or experiencing expansion of consciousness.

208
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
2. The cascade of state function reductions can be regarded as an analysis leading to a ﬁnal state in
which subselves are either entropically or negentropically entangled systems. The latter systems
can be seen as negentropic mental images resulting as subselves fuse together. In the case that
two sub-selves are involved, the resulting mental image can be regarded as an abstraction or
rule such that the state pairs appearing in the superposition correspond to the instances of
the rule. If one state pair dominates then association in classical sense is in question in good
approximation.
3. Negentropic entanglement can take place between systems which belong to same or diﬀerent
number ﬁelds and gives rise to various kinds of conscious experiences. At least in the case that
the other system is p-adic, negentropic entanglement should be a correlate for the conscious
experience of understanding.
4. Zero energy states for brain represent rules as pairs of positive energy (initial) and negative
energy (ﬁnal) states. M-matrix characterizes zero energy state and deﬁnes a rule representing
”laws of physics” at the level of conscious experience. Diﬀerent M-matrices are orthonormal
with respect to each other and in ensemble all of them appear and each of them can be also
regarded as representing one particular instance of a rule.
A new element is that unitary time evolution characterized by U-matrix forces the learning to
occur in the sector of state space containing zero energy states for which positive and negative energy
parts of the states are negentropically entangled. U-matrix and its powers characterize the learning
process. When the states are negentropically entangled, state function reduction for M-matrix is not
a random process but leads to a unique state maximing negentropy and in a good approximation the
restriction of U matrix to these states codes for the evolution of M-matrix. U N restricted in this
manner characterizes the M-matrix after N quantum jumps. Therefore learning is unvoidable in the
case of negentropic states and U N at the limit of large number of quantum jumps characterizes the
learning. The value of N is of course limited by the size of CD assigned to the learning system. One
can of course wonder whether the unitary period is following by a return to unentagled state via the
liberation of metabolic energy associated with the negentropic entanglement.
The powers of U deﬁne an iterative map and iterative maps are the key element of self organization
and also one of the main tools of generating fractals [K69] . Quantum classical correspondence therefore
suggests that 4-D fractal self-organization patterns deﬁne the space-time correlates for learning.
2. General view about learning at the level of brain
M-matrix for brain codes its view about laws of physics. In diagonal form represents pairing of
initial and ﬁnal states as rules A →B. For instance, in fermionic degrees of freedom these rules can
be interpreted as Boolean rules. More generally, the interaction as quantum associations containing
superposition of instances of the associations are in question. Huge quantum superposition of rules
is possible since the number of neurons large and the information storage capacity of entanglement
increases exponentially with the number of neurons.
U-matrix approximated as a matrix restricted to represent unitary evolution of negentropic zero
energy states assignable to brain provides the ﬁrst principle description for learning as the sequence
of powers U N. In the models of associative learning learning is reduced to a local process expressible
in terms of changes of the synaptic contacts. This suggests that the basic building block of U matrix
is synaptic transmission. This means an analogy with the basic braiding operation of the neighboring
strands represented as R-matrix deﬁning the unitry matrix for topological quantum computation [K23]
. There is also an analogy with generalized Feynman diagrams. The incoming particles would be neu-
rons. Synaptic transmission analogous to particle exchange between two neurons. U matrix can be
regarded as a quantum superposition over all possible diagrams containing arbitrary number of synap-
tic transfers. Multiverse picture at neural level thus results as one might expect since macrotemporal
and macroscopic quantum coherence is involved. If the situation reduces in a reasonable approxiation
to a description in terms of synaptic transfers one can in principle describe synaptic plasticity, LTP,
and LTD and other mechanisms to in terms of the basic building block of U associated with the
synaptic transmission and mathematically analogous to Feynman propagator. The binding to the
receptor could induce communications with genome and also the U-matrix assignable to topological
quantum computations at the DNA level might be involved.

4.4. Some applications at brain level
209
As such this picture provides only a ﬁrst principle formulation for what conscious learning is
and it requires a work to deduce predictions testing this vision or at least to gain understanding
using this vision. A key aspect of negentropic entanglement is that it carries metabolic energy. This
has been already proposed to provide a ﬁrst principle explanation for the notion of the high energy
phosphate bond crucial for the understanding of ATP →ADP + Pi process deﬁning the key stop of
metabolism [K26] .
Also space-like negentropic entanglement is possible for positive (negative) energy parts of the
states. In particular, negentropic entanglement between presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic genome
generated by the attachment of the transmitter to the receptor might make sense. There is temptation
to assign to this connection a magnetic ﬂux tube identiﬁed as a carrier of metabolic energy released
in the process and inducing ionic currents leading to the processes aﬀecting the synaptic strength as
well as the states of neurons involved. The larger the metabolic energy release is, the more intense are
the ionic currents involved and the stronger the modiﬁcation is. This would provide a ﬁrst principle
explanation for why more eﬀective phosphorylazation of the receptor as a correlate for learning. Of
course, the explanation works even without the heavy conceptual machinery if one is ready to accept
the somewhat nebulous notion of high energy phosphate bond.
4.4.3
Negentropic entanglement and the role of neurotransmitters
Soon after starting to develop TGD inspired theory of consciousness, I somehow ended up to an email
correspondence with Gene Johnson who insistently emailed me links to abstracts about neuroscience.
I read the classic Bible about brain by Kandel et al [J54] and tried to make sense of it in my own
conceptual framework. This was of course hopeless task since I had only the notions of quantum jump
and self. The feeling that something very simple -about which I do not and perhaps cannot ever have
a slightest clue- must be behind this incredible complexity made the situation really frustrating. The
deeper meaning of EEG, nerve pulse neurotransmitters, hormones- actually of entire brain chemistry
and also biochemistry- remained a total mystery.
Development of ideas
After the required number of years however some concrete ideas began to emerge.
1. The notion of magnetic body with fractal onionlike structure meant a decisive step of progress.
Also the hierarchy of Planck constants and dark matter as controller of visible matter in living
systems emerged. The function of EEG as communication and control tool of magnetic body
using biological body as a motor instrument and sensory receptor looked very natural. This led
also to a proposal that there is an entire hierarchy of EEGs and their variants. After several
trials a vision about nerve pulses as concomitants of quantum level communications emerged as
also a vision about DNA as topological quantum computer based on the ﬂux tubes connecting
DNA nucleotides with the lipid layers of cell membrane emerged and providing a function for
the intronic portions of genome as carriers of quantum computer programs [K23] .
2. Also a vision about the biochemical role of dark matter evolved. In particular, phase transi-
tions reducing Planck constant for a magnetic ﬂux tube would induce its contraction and force
biomolecules near to each other. This would explain the miracles of DNA replication, transla-
tion, and transcription and quite generally the processes known as aggregation of proteins. The
reconnection of magnetic ﬂux tubes changing the topology of the biological Indra’s net would
be also a central mechanism.
3. The model of nerve pulse and the vision about living matter as a kind of dynamical Indra’s
net led to a ﬁrst clear idea about the role of neural transmitters. Transmitters are classiﬁed
to inhibitory or excitatory depending on whether they increase or reduce the magnitude of the
membrane potential.
This property is however a property of the receptor rather than that
of the transmitter. The same transmitter can have both excitatory and inhibitory receptors
although often either receptor type dominates. The proposal was that neural transmitters are
associated with the ends of the links of the 4-dimensional web connecting neurons to each other.
Neurotransmitter attaches to the plug deﬁned by the receptor connecting the communication
wire from presynaptic neuron to the ﬂux tube leading to the passive portion of postsynpatic DNA

210
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
strand acting as sensory receptor. This would make possible rapid communications to DNA.
The corresponding active portion of DNA strand could then respond by generating an activity
at the level of cell membrane.
This conforms with the general idea that proteins represent
only one particular outcome of the gene expression. This left open the question whether the
excitatory-inhibitory dichotomy could have some deeper meaning.
4. Also it became clear the emotions and information are closely related and that peptides acting
both as neurotransmitters and hormones are crucial for emotions [J102] .
I proposed that
emotions are ”entropic” qualia. Although I realized the importance of negentropic entanglement
I did not have time or I was not able to realize how far reaching this notion actually is.
Is genome a fractal counterpart of brain?
Fractality replaces standard reductionism in TGD Universe. An old idea inspired by p-adic length
scale hypothesis is that the binary structures associated with p-adic scales L(k) ∝2k/2 and L(k + 2)
deﬁne a fractal hierarchy. Brain hemispheres would represent one example of this kind of pair, lipid
layers ofe cell mebrane second one, and DNA double strand third one. Just for fun one could assume
that the structure and functions of brain hemispheres have fractal analogs at the level of DNA double
strand and vice versa and look what kind of questions this inspires.
1. Could the identical structures of DNA strands correspond to the anatomical similarity of right
and left brain and could the functional asymmetry of the strands correspond to the laterizaliza-
tion of brain function? Could the genome act as the brain of cell? Could various brain areas
have counterparts at the level of DNA? Could the hydrogen bonds between nucleotides serve as
the counterpart of corpus callosum? Could the splitting of these bonds during transcription and
replication correspond to what happens to a split brain patient?
2. Before continuing it must be made clear that the global identiﬁcation of right-left dichotomy
with holistic-reductionistic dichotomy is wrong. One can however consider its local variant with
holism and reductionism assigned do the pairs of right and left brain areas. For instance, in con-
trast to the naive rule the emotional right (left) brain (amygdala) would be reductionistic (holis-
tic,negentropic) whereas the intellectual right (left) would be holistic (reductionistic,entropic).
The practical reason to the division to the entropic and negentropic pieces could relate to the
metabolism. The entropic regions could provide the binding energy as a usable energy to the
positive energy negentropic entanglement. Good is not possible without Evil! There are no
winners without loosers!
Right brain is specialized in spatial thinking and left brain to verbal thinking and arithmetics:
the geometry-algebra division of mathematics! Right brain is not so good in motor actions as
left brain as any right-handed person knows. Right brain is however better in tactile sensing:
right handed persons tend to use left hand for touching objects to get an idea about their shape.
Also this can be understood in holistic-reductionistic picture.
3. Apart from reﬂex actions almost all activities of the body seem to be controlled to a high degree
by brain. Could also the activitites of cell be regarded as motor actions of the genome acting
as the brain of cell receiving sensory imput from the cell membrane? Could one identify the
analogs of sensory areas receiving information from cell membrane, processing, and sending it
to the association areas? Could the analogs associative areas be identiﬁed as intronic portions
of DNA performing topological quantum computations and communicating the outcome to the
higher motor areas at the intronic portions of the of the complementary strand, wherefrom
they would be communicated to the primary motor areas identiﬁable as the regions of DNA
expressing themselves either chemically (RNA and proteins), as activitites generated directly at
the level of cell membrane, or electromagnetically? For instance, could neurotransmitter in the
receptor generate the feed of sensory input to the genome inducing the change of the membrane
potential as the counterpart of motor action. Could prokaryotes without introns be analogous
to brain with only primary sensory and motor areas or to mere ladder-like nervous system?
One could argue that the analogy between DNA are brain fails because second DNA strand is
completely passive whereas both brain hemispheres express themselves via motor actions. This
is not the case! Both DNA strand has regions expressing themselves but the transcription takes

4.4. Some applications at brain level
211
place in opposite directions. Hence DNA strands have motor and sensory areas as also brain
does, and the natural guess is that primary motor areas correspond to the areas expressing
themselves in terms of RNA, proteins, and possibly also as actions at the level of cell membrane.
Primary sensory areas would correspond to to regions complementary to the primary motor
regions.
4. What right brain sings-left brain talks metaphor could mean in this picture?
Pitch-rhythm
dichotomy is more technical expression for this dichotomy. Function providing local data and
its Fourier transform providing global data is more abstract representation for this dichotomy
and Uncertainty Principle for momentum and position relates closely to these two representations
of information. This dichotomy could reﬂect the presence of two diﬀerent natural time scales
and millisecond time scale for nerve pulses and .1 second time scale for moments of sensory
experience are the natural candidates.
If so, this dichotomy could directly reﬂect the diﬀerent time scales assignable to u and d type
quarks (1 millisecond) and to electron (100 ms) and reduce to the level of elementary parti-
cle physics. This dichotomy would also have fractally scaled up variants made possible by the
hierarchy of Planck constants. The analog of Fourier transform would be the negentropic unen-
tanglement of sub-CDs (assignable to quarks) to single mental image inside electron’s CD. The
analog of function itself would be a collection of sub-CDs representing separate unentangled
mental images assignable to individual nerge pulses in millisecond time scale. Also the topolog-
ical quantum computations assigned to the intronic portions correspond to diﬀerent time scales
due and reﬂect quark-lepton dichotomy. The quarks in question could be the quarks assigned
to the ends of ﬂux tubes in the model of DNA as topological quantum computer.
5. This raises some questions.
Could the gene expressions of the two strands somehow reﬂect
this dichotomy? For instance, could the ﬂux tube structures assignable to the aminoacid se-
quences correspond to the millisecond and 100 ms scales assignable to quarks and electron have
the property that also the functioning of these proteins is characterized by these typical time
scales? According to [I11] the time scales of protein folding vary from .1 s to 103s. According to
Wikipedia [I3] the typical time scale is 1 millisecond which suggests that the time scales corre-
spond to two ranges beginning from ms and 100 ms respectively. There are also short proteins
for which the folding takes place in microsecond time scales which might relate to the CD of
proton.
What can one say about the function of neurotransmitters?
Can one say anything interesting about the function of neurotransmitters if one combines this highly
speculative picture- which can be defended only by the belief on fractality as universal principle- with
the idea that bound state and negentropic entanglement make possible the fusion of mental images.
1. Suppose that the fusion of neuronal mental images is required to build higher level mental
images that we experience. Suppose that neuronal mental images involve DNA in an essential
manner. Suppose that magnetic ﬂux tubes serve as correlates for the entanglement so that the
transmission of nerve pulse from pre-synaptic neuron to post-synaptic one creates a ﬂux tube
connection between neurons possibly extending to the genome of the post-synaptic neuron. The
transmitter at the end of ﬂux tube attached to the receptor acting as a plug would build this
connection to some part of DNA specialized to receive particular kind of sensory data from
a particular region of cell membrane with complementary strand activating as a response a
motor function inducing gene expression at cell membrane level. Gene expression as build-up of
proteins would not be necessary and is also too slow for neural activities.
2. Suppose that the entanglement between neurons generated in this process is always negentropic
as the interpretation as the idea about neural correlate for a conscious association suggests.
One could also ask whether the neurons could entangled entropically and whether the entropic-
inhibitory association could make sense. This does not lead to anything interesting and en-
tropic entanglement between neurons should be regarded as a pathological condition. Note that
neuron-neuron entanglemement would be naturally time-like and in this case only negentropic
entanglement might be meaningful.

212
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
(a) To gain some perspective consider the activation of cell in general by some external per-
turbation from the resting state to the active state (here I have learned a lot from email
correspondence with Vladimir Mateev) In the resting state the proteins inside cell are pas-
sive -or rather, forced to be passive- as one might expect on basis of the general vision
about homeostasis. The unfolded proteins and unfolded portions of the folded proteins
are connected by hydrogen bonds to ordered water so that the folding occurring otherwise
spontaneously is prevented. One can say that the cellular winter prevails. The situation is
however nearly critical and if external perturbation occurs cell liberates metabolic energy
melting the ice and spring comes. Also the outer surfaces of globular proteins are hydrogen
bonded and when the ordered water melts, spontaneous melting of the protein takes place
leading to a partial unfolding.
The resulting folded proteins and partially unfolded globular proteins interact by forming
aggregates and this activity would naturally involve ℏreducing phase transitions and ﬂux
tube reconnections. In TGD based model the mechanism of both folding and melting would
be the liberation of metabolic energy destroying the hydrogen bonds and the energy for
this comes from the ATP containing positive energy negentropic bond between O=s of
phosphates.
(b) Similar situation could prevail at the cell membrane. One can imagine that cell membrane
is like a particle at the bottom of a small potential well. At the other side there is a deep
well representing the generation of nerve pulse and at the other side a high wall corre-
sponding to hyper-polarization requiring energy. Both polarization and hyperpolarization
are prevented by the freezing of protein activities needed to induce them. The ﬂux tubes
connecting the presynaptic neuron and receptor and possibly genome are always negen-
tropic and their formation can as such serve as the signal leading to the partial melting
of the ordered water making possible to generate action leading to either depolarization
or hyperpolarization. The signal could be just the additional metabolic energy making it
possible for these transitions to occur.
(c) This picture does not require any communications from the receptor to the genome and
in the simplest situation the resulting action could be seen as the analog of reﬂex action.
These communications could of course be present and the negentropic entanglement could
make it easier to induce depolarization also now. Also the question whether excitatory-
inhibitory dichotomy for the receptors has some deeper meaning apart from taking the
neuron nearer to or farther from criticality for ﬁring remains unanswered.

Diﬀerences between left and right brain hemisphere
The diﬀerences between left and right brain hemisphere or lateralization of brain functions -as the
more technical term states it - represent a challenge for any theory of consciousness. This diﬀerence
is often stated by saying that right brain is holistic and left brain reductionistic - or more concretely
- that left brain talks and right brain sings, left brain is linear and right brain parallel, or that left
brain is algebraist while right brain is geometer. The assignment of the holism-reductionism to the
hemispheres as whole is probably an exaggeration.
For instance, right limbic brain is specialized
to negative emotions and left limbic brain to positive emotions and it is not clear whether this has
anything to do with holism or reductionism.
It could however be that pairs of various left and
right brain regions could be characterized in terms of this dichotomy or perhaps trinity in which
reductionism, holism, and their fusion are possible but that a given region of given hemisphere can
favor any of these options.
Holism, reductionism and their fusion, entanglement, and zero energy ontology
In TGD framework the basic mechanism responsible for reductionism-holism dichotomy would be the
possibility of the mental images to fuse to larger mental images. Depending on the nature of entangle-
ment the resulting mental images are either negentropic or entropic. Entropic entanglement represents
a holism as the antipode of reductionism whereas negentropic entanglement seems to represent a fu-
sion of holism and reductionism. It would be tempting to assign positive emotions to the negentropic
entanglement and negative emotions to the entropic entanglement. Both limbic hemispheres could be
holistic but negentropic-entropic dichotomy would distinguish between them.

4.4. Some applications at brain level
213
For the purposes of survival it is good to have both all these three views about reality. In politics
hawks, doves and compromize makers would be a counterpart for this phenomenon. This would favor
lateralization in a more general sense that a brain region in given hemisphere favours unentangled
emotionally neutral mental images, negentropically fused mental images with positive emotional col-
oring, or entropically fused mental images with negative emotional coloring. Also metabolism could
favor formation of the unpleasant entropic mental images since this liberates energy which could be
stored in metabolic entanglement as a metabolic energy. Interestingly, it has been proposed that the
simultaneous presence of holism and reductionism could explain the amazing mental feats of idiot
savants. The irony is that these persons are usually unable to describe their experiences using lan-
guage, which brings in mind the reports of meditators telling that it is impossible to tell anything
about englightment experience using language. Maybe language relates crucially both to the ability
to decompose the mental images to smaller pieces and to form entropically entangled wholes of them.
I might be self-contradictory here. On one hand, I have proposed that the feats of idiot savants are
possible because they do not conceptualize and in this manner replace reality with the names of the
objects of the reality: something extremely economical if one counts bits. On the other hand, I am
proposing that the formation of concepts corresponds to the negentropic entanglement. It seems that
I should distinguish between two kinds of conceptualizations: the negentropic entanglement without
language on one hand achieved in meditative practices and the combination of both entropically
entangled and non-entangled representations making possible language but losing the insight of genius.
Zero energy ontology suggests a quantitative formulation of this vision based on the observation
that the time scale of electron’s CD corresponds to the .1 second time scale deﬁning fundamental
biorhythm whereas millisecond time scale deﬁning the fundamental time scale of nerve pulse activity
could relate closely to the time scale of CDs assignable to u and d quarks predicted to play a key
role in quantum information processing in the model of DNA ast topological quantum computer.
There are also shorter times scales, in particular the time scales assignable to proton which can be
estimated to be of order 10−7 seconds. Also p-adically scaled up variants of these time scales are
possible as well as zooming of these time scales at the pages of the Big Book deﬁning generalized
imbedding space and partially labeled by the values of Planck constant. The ﬁrst guess is that quark
and lepton time scales are behind the reductionism-holism division. Holism would mean temporal
binding of the mental images assignable to nerve pulse patterns and characterized by millisecond time
scale to negentropic (or possibly entropic) subselves characterized by .1 second time scales. Quark
like sub-CDs of electronic CDs would serve as imbedding space correlates for these mental images.
Objection against simplistic view about lateralization
The hypothesis that right brain is more holistic than left brain can be tested and a considerable
support for the hypothesis have been found. There is however a rather paradoxical experimental result
challenging the hypothesis in its simplest form and suggesting that the roles of various processing levels
of brain hemispheres in the specialization to geometric shapes and linguistic symbols can vary. In [J83]
there is report about two experimental situations testing right-left diﬀerences.
1. Subject persons saw ﬁgure S consisting of smaller ﬁgure F:s. On basis of neural ﬁring left brain
seemed to recognize smaller F:s whereas right brain seemed to recognize the entire ﬁgure S: just
as expected.
2. For control purposes ﬁgure S consisting of small F:s was replaced with a ﬁgure of anchor con-
sisting of small cups. What happened was that left brain recognized the anchor and right brain
recognized the cups! Also ﬁring patterns were essentially the same! It was conjectured that
the smallness of cups -smaller than letter F:s- might have something to do with the unexpected
result.
Apparentely the replacement of letters with geometric shapes means that the roles of brain hemi-
spheres changed. This suggests that the naive vision about roles of hemispheres must be replaced
with something more complex in which one has scale hierarchy of levels such that each level has its
own specialization.
1. Suppose ﬁrst that at the lowest level of the hierarchy the left hemisphere is better in recognizing
letters than familiar shapes and right hemisphere better in recognizing familiar geometric shapes
than letters.

214
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
2. The subject persons are asked to concentrate on either the entire ﬁgure or details which repeat
themselves. This raises the question whether a single detail becomes actually the whole since
the attention is directed to details. If this is the case, the ﬁrst assumption would explain why
right brain hemisphere ﬁres as cup is recognized. Same applies to the left hemisphere in the case
of letter F.
3. When the ﬁgure as a whole must be recognized, the recognizing hemisphere seems to be the
one for which the recognition should be more diﬃcult! The hierarchy of CDs allows to consider
the possibility that there is a fractal hierarchy of levels corresponding to diﬀerent size scales for
the structures appearing in the ﬁgure. The very fact that subject person is conscious about the
existence of smaller details means that smallest structures are mapped to the ﬁrst level of the
hierarchy so that in both cases the ﬁgure as a whole would be mapped to the second level of the
hierarchy. If one takes the experimental result at a face value, letters should be more familiar
to the right hemisphere and geometric shapes of everyday objects to the left hemisphere at the
second level of the hierarchy.
4. That the roles of brain hemispheres in lateralization depend on the level of the hierarchy might
have an explanation in terms of basic information processing involving communications between
hemispheres. Maybe there is a mapping from the ﬁrst level of hierarchy of a given hemisphere
to the second level of hierarchy at the opposite hemisphere and so on. At higher levels of the
hierarchy the hemispheres would perceive each others visual percepts. Right hemisphere at the
n:th level would receive sensory signals from n −1:th level of left brain and vice versa. In this
kind of situation the maximal eﬀectiveness of the information processing would be achieved if
these two ladders rather than hemispheres have similar specializations.
Some examples
This framework explains various aspects of holism-reductionism dichotomy when given pair of brain
regions is considered but it is not meant to apply to brain hemispheres as a single pair.
1. Linear-parallel dichotomy suggests that in a given time scale left hemisphere corresponds to
large number of un-entangled subselves whereas right hemisphere would correspond to a larger
number of entangled subselves with entropic (at least in case of limbic brain) or negentropic
entanglement.
For instance, the unentangled subselves can correspond to letters of written
text at left hemisphere. At right hemisphere they could correspond to objects of everyday life
or even understood words of written text with mental images representing letters entangling
negentropically in time direction to form a single mental image. Also much smaller details such
as edges an lines of ﬁgure having no direct meaning are certainly involved.
Left brain seems to be skilled in forming mental images about structures consisting of well
deﬁned components whereas right brain can grasp the general shape and size of the structure
(note however the previous example in conﬂict with this belief). This could be understood if
left brain represents structures linguistically as associative linear structures consisting of parts
represented as sub-selves. Thus a structure could be realized as a reverberating neural circuit
in which sub-selves representing parts of the structure keep each other awake.
2. Right hemisphere is also claimed to be less analytic. It might be that also this might hold true
only for the right-left-right-.. information processing hierarchy when compared with left-right-
left... hierarchy beginning from left brain hemisphere. Certainly the entanglement of mental
images would explain this.
3. That left brain talks whereas right brain (almost) sings is more than a loose metaphor. It is
known that people who have left brain injury and cannot talk can sometimes express themselves
by singing. Linear-parallel dichotomy would suggest that left brain is specialized to subjecto-
temporal sequences of parallel small-sized mental images of short duration (say words of speech):
this would correspond rhythm and other temporally local aspects of music which dominate in
speech. Right brain is specialized to large selves formed by the fusion of parallel sub-selves
formed by, say, separate notes of music which can last long time and have no linguistic content.
These mental images should carry conscious information about non-local aspect such as pitch

4.4. Some applications at brain level
215
of the sound. Although the notes of song are heard one in time, they would continue to live
in right brain as parallel mental images and make possible to experience the melody as sad or
joyfu or to remember the key of the music piece.
4. The poor temporal and spatial resolution assigned to the right hemisphere can be seen as a price
paid for the holism of entanglement. Again one must however remember that a scale hierachy
might be involved.
5. The claim that right brain is more emotional should be taken with a caution. It seems better
to say that the right limbic brain is dominated by negative emotions and left limbic brain by
positive ones. The interpretation would be in terms of entropic resp. negentropic entanglement:
in this sense left brain would have higher emotional intelligence.
On the other hand, right
brain is claimed to have better skills in recognizing and expressing emotions. This is not in
conﬂict with the fact that left brain hemisphere is the happier hemisphere. These skills could be
understood as a more holistic expression of emotions and their perception, and migh also relate
to the ability of the right hemisphere to generate negentropic entanglement with other brains.
Dr. P. and twins who saw primeness
Oliver Sack’s book ’The man who mistook his wife for a hat’ [J116] contains fascinating stories about
those aspects of brain and consciousness which are more or less mysterious from the view point
of neuroscience. There are two stories which relate very closely to reductionism-holism tension of
conscious experiencing.
The ﬁrst story is about Dr. P. who suﬀered visual agnosia and could not recognize concrete objects,
say faces unless some nonvisual association was involved. He could however recognize abstract symbols
or objects containing some symbolic details making possible the recognition (he recognized Einstein’s
face, which has indeed become a symbol of wisdom!).
Sacks tells about how his patient tried to
recognize glove. ’A curved shaped containing ﬁve small bags’ was his abstract analysis: he could not
identify the glove as a glove unless he got it in his hand! He could however deﬁne glove as an abstract
geometric shape allowing simple linguistic description. Dr. P. could identify abstract shapes and
symbols like letters and geometric objects but could not recognize real world objects. Amazingly, Dr.
P. used musical associations as a manner to cope with the complexities of everyday life. He singed
through all his everyday activities and lost control totally if this was for some reason not possible. He
could also continue teaching of this music class. For instance, he could recognize his music students
only when they moved by recognizing their ’body music’.
As discussed, reductionism-holism duality provides the deep reason for why we have two brain
lobes. This allows to understand what might be possibly involved with Dr. P:s case. Dr. P:s right
visual areas had been damaged and he could not recognize faces and concrete objects of the visual
ﬁeld. Left visual areas were in good condition and he could identify abstract objects. Other than
visual areas were still in good condition in both hemispheres and he could perform recognition using
musical associations, associations created by smells, etc... Sacks notices also a deep analogy with
Dr. P.:s case and neuroscience. Expressing rather freely what Luria said, entire neuroscience up to
seventies provided analytic description of left brain about left brain. It had indeed turned out very
diﬃcult to assign any easily identiﬁable cognitive dysfunctions with localized right brain injuries and
Luria’s opinion was that this necessitated completely diﬀerent approach which he called ’romantic’
(stories of right brain about both right and left brain!).
In fact, one can formulate new kind of Uncertainty Principle, perhaps it might be called Uncertainty
Principle of cognition. Same mental image cannot be both holistic and reductionistic simultaneously.
The combination of reductionistic and holistic descriptions (and all possible intermediate descriptions
combining parts to subwholes in various manners) to single description is impossible even in principle!
Science and Art as descriptions of the world are very much like mutually incompatible observables
of Uncertainty Principle! The obvious reaction of the alert reader is that negentropic entanglement
might allow to achieve both reductionism and holism simultaneously. Maybe this is the case but in
this case there is no manner to communicate the mental using language if the proposed interpretation
is correct.
Sacks tells also about twins, John and Michael, who had mysterious ability to ’see’ large numbers.
For instance, matchbox was dropped from the table and its contents were spread along the ﬂoor.
Both twins shouted immediately ’111!’. Then John mumbled ’37’, Michael repeated it and John said

216
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
’37’ third time. Obviously this was their cognitive representation for the decomposition 111=3x37 of
number 111 to a product of primes!
How John and Michael did these numerical feats? The ﬁrst thing to notice is that twins had
intelligence quotient of about 60 and could not perform even simplest arithmetical operations. They
did not even understand what the concepts of prime and decomposition into prime factors mean
conceptually. They however experienced primes as especially interesting numbers and even played
a game in which they invented new primes. One can safely assume that they did not consciously
calculate the decomposition of number 111 to a product of primes. When asked how they were able to
tell the number of matches, they told that they ’saw’ it. In fact, their eyes moved in strange manner
always when they were performing numerical tasks and stopped when the solution was found. Also
the decomposition of 111 to a product of 3 primes ’37’ seemed to occur completely spontaneously ’in
front of their eyes’.
The mysterious ability of twins is not a mere curiosity but could provide a crucial clue to the
problem of understanding of how numbers are realized as mental images.
Indeed, also ordinary
human beings are able to experience directly ’N-ness’, when the size of N is small. A sensory memory
associating the visual mental image with the verbal representations of ’N’ could be in question. This
association resembles synesthetic associations, which are also completely automatic.
Thus the problem transforms to a more general question ’How integers are experienced directly?’.
1. In TGD framework the answer to the question is obvious.
Experiencing of ’N-ness’ means
experiencing ’N’ separate objects as a single whole and corresponds quantum physically to
the generation of negentropic entanglement between the cognitive representatives of individual
objects. If the resulting mental image associates automatically with a linguistic expression for
’N-ness’, say ’N = 5 ↔five’, reportable recognition of ’N-ness’ occurs. 7 ± 2 law suggests that
this entanglement and association usually occurs only for maximal number of objects not larger
than N = 7 ± 2. In case of a numerical genius this number seems to be drastically higher. The
generation of this entanglement should be spontanous self-organization process in either brain
hemisphere and entangled objects could correspond to separate neuron groups or neurons.
2. The decomposition of integer N = N1 × N2 to a product of integers must in this picture
correspond to the spontaneous formation of identical ’sub-wholes’.
This process must be a
quantum self-organization process. It could favour the decomposition of N = N1 × N2 objects
to N1 ’sub-wholes’ consisting of N2 entangled basic objects or decomposition of N2 sub-wholes
consisting of N1 basic objects or something else depending on factors of N. This kind of ﬁnal
states of self-organization are natural since they are very symmetrical consisting of a repetition
of an identical basic unit. This kind of self-organization patterns are analogous to the lattice-like
self-organization patterns of Benard ﬂow.
3. NMP [K44] could be involved in the following manner.
Suppose that the perception of the
number of N objects generates in brain an ensemble consisting of N mental images, which
entangle negentropically. If so, then the simplest expectation is that entanglement probabilities
are proportional to 1/N and the number theoretical entanglement entropy is large only for p-
adic primes dividing N. The prime divisor of N giving rise to the largest number theoretic
negentropy would determine the p-adicity involved and this could correspond to a perception
about the decomposition of the visual representation of N to N/p pieces.
The model also explains the ability of twins to see whether a given number is prime or not. Primes
are stable against decomposition into sub-wholes and are therefore ’elementary particles of cognition’.
Hence primeness is a ’visible’ property: primes are numerical mental images stable against decay to
a set of identical numerical mental images. Note that this dynamical process breaks the symmetry
between the factors of integer. This clearly occurred in 111= 3×37 example. Twins did not ’see’ ’3’:
they saw only some 37’s and did not explicitely tell that there were precisely three 37:s!
In [K8] a more concrete model for how real space-time sheets could represent integers and their
prime factorization by their eﬀectively p-adic topology, is discussed.
4.4.5
Music and consciousness
Music experience provides an interesting testing ground for several assumptions of quantum TGD and
TGD inspired theory of consciousness. The notion of self is especially interesting in this respect.

4.4. Some applications at brain level
217
Some aspects of music experience
It is good to list ﬁrst some elementary characteristics of music experience that the model should be able
to explain. Both rhytmic aspects and pitch of the sound are important. Rhytmic aspects correspond
to time domain representation for the intentisity of sound carrying local information about sound
wave whereas pitch carries global information. The relationship between these two elements of music
is like that of function and its Fourier transform. Harmony enters the game when several frequencies
are present.
1. Rhythm
There are two basic types of views about rhythm, additive and divisive, and they correspond to
the multiplication and sum as basic arithmetic operations.
1. In western music rhythm corresponds to a division of longer periods of time divived into smaller
rhytmic units. Rhythm is basically a clock and rhytm is essentially a decomposition of integer
to a product of integers deﬁning the rhythmic unit and their number. Classical western music
is relatively simple rhythmically (consider only the music of Bach). In the music of Chopin
tempo rubato makes the duration of the basic rhythmic unit and of its basic structural elements
dnamical but rhythms are still relatively simple altough simultaneous 3/4 and 3/8+3/8 appears
often. In jazz and various forms of popular music rhythms tend to be highly clocklike but are
very complex.
2. In Indian music for instance, rhytms are additive and larger periods of time are constructed
from smaller rhythmic unis added to the end of the previous unit. This division corresponds to
addition rather than multiplication algebraically. Also intermediate forms can appear and do so
often in folk music (say folk music of Greece, Balkan, and Spain). For instance, one can have the
sum of 3/4+3/8+3/8 as a repeating rhytmic unit. In ﬂamenco form known as Bulerias [J7] the
basic rhytmic unit consists of 12 beats and the collective performance creates a very complex
and emotionally catching rhythm, which is almost impossible to analyze to pieces. It is easy to
believe the claim that artists often fall in trance during the ﬂamenco sessions.
2. Pitch
Pitch can be identiﬁed as the fundamental frequency of note.
Pure sine wave is aesthetically
unpleasing and harmonics are always present and characterize the music instrument. Not only fre-
quencies but also phase relationships between them are important. For instance, they distinguish
between the phonemes of spoken language and in the case of singing this brings in an important addi-
tional element not so important for non-electronic instrumental music. Furthermore, melody is never
a mere sequence of precisely deﬁned frequencies. For instance, slow modulations of the pitch reduc-
ing mathematically to a superposition of closely separated frequencies and glissandos have emotional
aﬀect.
The model of music experience should explain also the following aspects related to pitch understand
as fundamental frequency.
1. Octaves of the fundamental are experienced as equivalent. The presence of higher harmonics is
needed to make pure sinus wave a musical note. Higher harmonics determine the character of
the pitch chracterizing the music instrument.
2. There exists a large number of diﬀerent scales to which one assigns attributes like diatonic,
minor, chromatic, whole tone, pentatonic, diminished...
All these scales have quite speciﬁc
emotional coloring and they characterize diﬀerent music styles. The minimum frequency interval
corresponds to a minimal scaling of the frequency and depends on music style. Western classical
music uses semitone as the basic unit correwponding to the scaling 21/12 in equally tempered scale
but also microintervals are used and the only limitation comes the from ability to discriminate
between diﬀerent frequencies. The scales have special notes such as tonic, supertonic, mediant,
subdominant, dominant, submediant, subtonic with special roles in harmony.
For instance,
listener is often able to remember the basic scales even if the tonic of the scale has suﬀered several
modulations during the music piece.
Deviations from basic scale have important emotional
eﬀects (say in the case of minor scale).

218
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
3. Ancient mathematicians believed that the presence of rational multiples of fundamental fre-
quencies are essential for harmony. It is possible to construct the basic scales involving only
rational multiples of the fundamental in terms of selected harmonics. For instance, Pythagorean
construction uses only powers of 3/2 and octaves to construct the basic scale (C,G,D,A,E,H,...).
Although the pitch is distinguished only within a ﬁnite resolution and equally tempered 12-
note scale uses only powers of 21/12 of the fundamental, rational multiples of the fundamental
might relate deeply to the basic physics of cognition and to the frequencies generated in brain
as opposed to those used to produce the music.
4. The expectation of an engineer is that the transposition of the scale should not eﬀect on the
music experience and one could think that it could be done in a continuous manner. Many
composers, for instances Sibelius, experienced diﬀerent modes diﬀerently and as synesthetes
assigned to them diﬀerent visual associations. Many people are able to recognize the ratios of
notes but there is also the much rare phenomenon of absolute ear meaning that subject person
is able to tell the pitch of the note directly. A synesthesia like phenomen is probably in question.
5. An interesting question the notion of absolute scale could make sense to some degree? The
fundamental frequency of sound producing organs is 10 Hz and the region of audible frequencies
begins at 20 Hz and consists of approximately 10 octaves.
kHz frequency is the resonance
frequence of head sized object and at this frequency the mechanism allowing to deduce the
direction of sound source changes. The biological basis for this would be that 10 Hz and 1 kHz
deﬁne fundamental biorhythms. The quantum physical basis for this could relate to the p-adic
length scale hypothesis predicting that 10 Hz and 1280 Hz could correspond CDs of electron
and quarks. To get a contact with concretia note that soprano C corresponds to 1046.50 Hz.
Also the cyclotron frequencies assignable to various biologically important ions in endogenic
magnetic ﬁelds could deﬁned preferred scales. The A above middle C corresponds by convention
to 440 Hz, which is integer multiple of 10 Hz but by pure convention and ﬁfth octave of 8.175 Hz
which is not too far from the lowest Schumann resonance. An interesting question is whether
the transposition to a scale for which the fundamental is simple rational multiple of 10 Hz or
lowest Schumann resonance might have some speciﬁc emotional eﬀect.
3. Harmony and other collective aspects of music
Harmony relates closely to the interaction of diﬀerent frequencies and is therefore one particular
collective aspect of music experience.
In the terminology of physicists, harmony is a phenomenon of many particle physics with particles
replaced notes of the scale and many-particle states with chords. Depending on the ratios of the
frequencies certain chords are aesthetically pleasing and emotionally signiﬁcant and there are also
principles goverining aesthetically pleasing chord progressions. Harmony might be seen as the vertical
aspect of the music whereas melody would correspond to horizontal one. Dissonance is the opposite of
harmony and tritonus was forbidden in the early western music but is nowadays used to create tension.
Polyphony -say in Bach’s music- and simple chords used to accompany singing represent two opposite
views about harmony. Chopin’s music has especially rich harmonies and emotional expressive power.
While listening music one typically selects some instrument as ﬁgure and the rest as a background.
In romantic piano concertos the competition between the solist and orchestra about the attention of
the listener creates the basic tension. In polyphonic music one must also select the tone progression
to which attention is directed and it is diﬃcult -perhaps even impossible- to simultaneously grasp the
separte tone progressions. Same applies to other elements of music.
Zero energy ontology, hierarchy of Planck constants, and number theoretic physics
The number theoretic vision brings interesting new physics elements which might help to understand
music experience.
1. The hierarchy of selves has as an imbedding space correlate the hierarchy of CD is basic predic-
tion. p-Adic length scale hypothesis suggests that quantization of size scales of CDs as octaves
and the question is whether this relates directly to the preferred role of octaves in music expe-
rience. The time scales of CDs deﬁne preferred fundamental frequencies coming as octaves and

4.4. Some applications at brain level
219
the hierarchy of Planck constants deﬁnes scaled variants of these as rational or integer multiples
(depending on generalization of the imbedding space).
2. The question is whether these fundamental frequencies also deﬁne fundamental keys so that
music experience would depend on absolute frequency scale. Even if CDs deﬁne fundamental
keys, the frequency scale associated with sub-CD as experienced in the rest system of CD can
be scaled continuously by performing a Lorentz boost for CD. Even glissando could be achieved
for CD by performing to the sub-CD a Lorentz boost continuously and leaving the other tip of
CD invariant. The boost would be the hyperbolic analog of an ordinary rotation and act like
acceleration from rest to constant velocity inside sub-CD. If one takes this picture seriously also
Lorentz boosts would be important part of the representation of music at the level of magnetic
body (presumably using MEs). Quantum TGD proper suggests the quantization of these boosts.
3. Number theoretic vision predicts an inﬁnite number of algebraic extensions of p-adic numbers -in
particular those corresponding to roots of unity. In the p-adic context the proper representation
of sine waves requires the introduction of these algebraic extensions and the prediction is that
rational multiples of the fundamental frequencies assignable to p-adic length scales should have
a special role from the point of view of cognition.
This might justify the belief that the notes of the scale should be expressible in the optimal
situation as rational multiples of the fundamental note. The cognitive representation of the
music in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds should map the physical frequencies or rather
the sine waves at a discrete set of time values to their p-adic counterparts. One has to deal
with phase factors deﬁned by plane waves exp(iftn) at discrete set of points tn such that the
exponent equals to exp(i2πm/N) and belongs to the algebraic extension. The harmonics of f
obviously satisfy the same condition. The representation of pitch in terms of algebraic extensions
of rationals requires that the corresponding partonic 2-surfaces correspond to complex enough
algebraic extensions of rationals containing high enough roots of unity. The modulation of the
pitch as superposition of two nearby rational frequencies could is possible without leaving this
framework.
4. One can consider also diﬀerent but not exclusive explanation for why scales deﬁne preferred
collections of frequencies. Pythagorean scale involves rational multiples of fundamental obtained
as powers of 3/2 and 2 so that the frequencies involved correspond to rationals of form 3m2n
for which only 3-adic and 2-adic norms diﬀer from one. Small-p p-adicity associated with p = 2
and p = 3 could select the preferred frequencies.
Why octaves are experienced similarly?
The model should explain the basic features of music experience. There are many interesting ques-
tions related to this. One of the most important is why frequencies which are 2k- multiples of the
fundamental frequency, notes diﬀering by octaves, are experienced as identical notes.
1. p-Adic length scale hypothesis, zero energy ontology, and octaves
Thus the phenomenon of octaves could relate to the p-adic length scale hypothesis, which implies
that physically preferred p-adic primes correspond to primes near prime power powers of two. For
instance, this implies that the massless extremals (MEs) associated with physically important p-
adic primes have fundamental frequencies which are octaves of each other.
Therefore a classical
resonance via the formation of join along boundaries bonds becomes possible and real space-time
sheets corresponding to preferred p-adic primes can form larger resonant structures. This universal
resonance could explain why octaves are experienced similarly. The problem of this argument was
that primary p-adic time scales would come as half octaves instead of octaves.
Octaves seem to have much deeper signiﬁcance than I thought originally and seem to emerge
at the level of fundamental formulation of quantum TGD rather than characterizing only a very
special kind of sensory experience. In the recent formulation of quantum TGD using zero energy
ontology [K17, K16] one uses zero energy states which have their positive and negative energy parts
at the light-like boundaries of causal diamonds consisting of future and past directed light-cones.
Physics as a generalized number theory vision, in particular the assumption that real physics and
various p-adic physics result as algebraic completions of rational physics, motivates the hypothesis

220
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
that the temporal distance T between the tips of the causal diamond is quantized and corresponds to
powers of 2 using time scale deﬁned by CP2 size as a basic unit. This assumption allows to deduce
p-adic length scale hypothesis (p ≃2k, k integer), and to identify T as a secondary p-adic time
scale. For electron this time scale is .1 seconds and corresponds to the fundamental 10 Hz biorhythm.
For non-standard values of Planck constant T is scaled by a factor ℏ/ℏ0. Thus octaves become a
key element of fundamental physics. One can say that causal diamonds as space-time correlates of
self appear naturally as octaves. Also rational multiples of fundamental frequency emerge via the
hierarchy of Planck constants: in principle all rational scalings of the basic hierarchy are allowed.
2. Is sensory experience 2-adic in some sense?
A stronger hypothesis for the phenomenon of octaves is that cognitive music selves are 2-adic or
that real music selves can transform easily to 2-adic selves. One might even consider the possibility
that the phenomenon is much more general. Music metaphor has indeed turned out to be of crucial
importance for the theory of qualia. Thus music metaphor could reﬂect the underlying 2-adicity of the
sensory experience (at some level of self hierarchy). Perhaps at least some aspects of our experience
result from a mimicry of the lowest level of the p-adic self-hierarchy. Taking 2-adicity seriously, one
is forced to ask for the possible consequences of 2-adicity. For instance, could it be that at the level
of primary qualia the intensity of sensation as function of stimulus depends on the 2-adic norm of the
2-adic counterpart of the stimulus and is thus a piecewise constant function if sensory input?
An observation supporting this speculation is following. When overlearning occurs in tasks in-
volving temporal discrimination, the intensity of sensation as a function of stimulus deviates from
smooth logarithmic form in small scales by becoming piecewise continuous function [J71] such that
the plateus, where response remains constant are octaves of each other.
This observation suggests a generalization inspired by 2-adic version of music metaphor. Primary
quale has a multiple of cyclotron frequency as its correlate and, being integer valued, is essentially
2-based logarithm of the 2-adic norm for the 2-adic counterpart of the intensity of the sensory input.
Hence the increase of intensity of the sensory input by octave correspond to a jumpwise replacement
of the n:th harmonic by n + 1:th one and should be seen in EEG. Our experience usually corresponds
to the average over a large number of this kind of primary experiences so that underlying 2-adicity is
smoothed out. In case of overlearning or neurons involved act unisono and the underlying 2-adicity is
not masked anymore.
At the level of MEs this would mean generation of higher harmonic when the number of nerve
pulses per unit of time achieves threshold value allowing the ampliﬁcation of corresponding frequency
by the mechanism discussed already earlier. This certainly would mean that cognition is an important
part of music experience. The strongest assumption is that the real note selves are able to transform
to 2-adic selves by a phase transition changing local topology from real to 2-adic. Note however that
p-adic length scale hypothesis might be enough.
Does harmonic complexity reduce to 3-adicity?
An interesting question relates to the conditions guaranteing that a chord is experienced as harmonious
in the Pythagorean sense [J18] . Pythagorean tuning is based on the notion of perfect ﬁfths identiﬁed
as scalings by 3/2 producing the sequence C,G,D,A,E,.. In this tuning major-C scale corresponds to
ratios C = 1/1, D = 9/8, E = 81/64, F = 4/3, G = 3/2, A = 27/16, B = 243/128, C = 2/1. Eb and
F# correspond to ratios 25/33 and 36/29. All notes are expressible as powers of two and three. Since
the multiplication of any note by a power of two does not aﬀect the harmony it should be to drop
the powers of two from the integers characterizing the notes in the ratio of three notes. For instance,
C-E-G reduces 3 : 34 : 1, C −Eb −G to 34 : 1 : 33, and tritonus C −Eb −F# to 39 : 1 : 33. The
problem of Pythagorean tuning is that one cannot represent 2 as an exact integer power of 3/2 and the
scalings give inﬁnite number of tones. If the construction starts from Gb then F# and Gb correspond
to frequencies, which are not quite identical in Pythagorean tuning. One could make compromize by
introducing the geometric mean of F# and Gb but this would bring in
√
3 and would force to leave the
world of pure rationals. For string instruments and electronic instruments the Pythagorean tuning is
practical but for instruments like piano the transposition of the scale is impossible.
One should be able to characterize a given chord harmonically by a function F(a, b, c), which is
symmetric under the permutations of the reduced pitches a, b and c obtained by dropping powers
of two and is invariant under over all scaling of the reduce frequencies. The elementary symmetric

4.4. Some applications at brain level
221
functions F(a, b, c) = [a2(b + c) + b2(a + c) + c2(a + b)]/abc and G(a, b, c) = [a3 + b3 + c3]/abc are the
simplest functions of this kind. Either of these functions or their product or ratio could be considered
as a measure for the harmonic complexity. The value of the denominator abc equals to 3n, n = 3, 7, 12
in the cases considered. The numerator has in all cases 3-adic norm equal to one for both F and G.
This suggests that the 3-based logarithm of the 3-adic norm 1/|abc|3 = |F|3 = |G|3 having the values
3,7, and 12 for C-major, C-minor, and tritonus could serve as the measure for the complexity. It is
indeed smallest for major and largest for tritonus. 3-adic norm for the product 1/a1a2...an of n notes
of the chord deﬁnes a measure of complexity in more general case. A good guess is that the 3-adic
norms of the elementary symmetric functions give rise to the same measure.
For the chords C-E-G, F-A-C, and G-H-D appearing as basic chords in C- major scale the values
of the harmonic measure are 3, 2, and 8. This means that the basic chords are not harmonically
equivalent in Pythagorean system whereas in equally tempered system they would be. One might
think that this explains why the tonic is remembered. The anomalously low value for F-A-C relates
to the fact that it is only tone for which the power of 3 is negative. Situation changes of F is identiﬁed
as a minimal power of 3 giving F equivalent with Pythagorean F within the resolution of ear to pitch
which is about |∆f/f| = 4.3 per cent . F = 35/28 gives |∆f/f| = 4.8 per cent. This F would give
for F-A-C the harmonic measure 8 which equals to that for G. This looks more reasonable than the
purely Pythagorean value. This deﬁnition would also allow to ﬁnd a unique choice of powers of three
for 12-chord system. For instance, F# is favored over Gb since it corresponds to a positive power of 3.
The notion of self and music
The music experience allows also to test the ideas related to the notion of self.
1. Summation hypothesis states that self is a sum of abstracted experiences of sub-selves and thus
representing kind of averages about the experiences of sub-sub-selves.
(a) The conscious experience induced by music decomposes in a clear manner to basic elements
identiﬁable as subselves. For instance, melody and more generally various tone progressions
could deﬁne such subselves and the experiences of these subselves would sum up to music
experience. In the same manner rhytmic patterns deﬁne their own subselves. Therefore it
might make sense to speak about ”frequency subselves” and ”rhythm subselves”.
(b) At space-time level the magnetic body and massless extremals (MEs) are the natural can-
didate for the representation of ”frequency subselves”. One can say that MEs provide a
universal music instrument at the level of magnetic body since they allow arbitrary su-
perposition of collinear waves proceeding in the same direction which is non-dispersive
(shape of the pulse is preserved) so that arbitrary harmonics are possible for a ME with
ﬁxed length. Maybe the the temporal duration of subselves assignable to MEs is what
distinguishes between these representations.
(c) A collection of subselves associated with ME at precisely deﬁned periodically appearing
positions could deﬁne rhythm whereas frequency selves would correspond to MEs with
relatively long temporal duration. Interpreting MEs in terms of communications to the
magnetic body, one expects that the rhythm automatically generates short-lasting MEs
communication the pulses deﬁning the rhythm to the magnetic body whereas pitch corre-
sponds to long lasting MEs.
(d) This picture challenges the assumption that the mental images created during music ex-
perience are localized to brain. Rather, MEs and magnetic body would be the carriers of
the mental images. Maybe one could say that nerve pulse patterns induce these MEs. In
left hemisphere nerve pulse patterns induced by the beats of rhythm and having a total
duration considerably below .1 second would send single ME to the magnetic body. In right
hemisphere the pulse patterns would integrate to single ME having duration of the note.
2. The hypothesis that entanglement creates wholes from parts and that there are three cogni-
tive modes corresponding to reductionistic and holistic cognition and their hybrid based on
negentropic entanglement is of special interest in the context of music experience.

222
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
(a) Even admitting the dangers of naive right-left thinking it would seem natural to assign the
rhythmic aspects of the music to the reductionistic regions of brain and various aspects
related to pitch to the right brain hemisphere. At least in the latter case MEs are highly
suggestive as a fundamental representation of music at the level of magnetic body. Perhaps
music experience actually involves in a very essential manner also magnetic body. That
”eastern” music favors additive instead of divisive rhythm could be understood as higher
right brain dominance. The extremely mechanical rhytms characterizing the popular music
today, the lack of melodic aspects, and the use of the volume of music as the basic means to
induce emotional eﬀect, could in turn interpreted in terms of extreme left brain dominance.
(b) Music can have a strong emotional eﬀects and this allows to test the hypothesis that the
character of entanglement correlates with the emotional color. Maybe just the fact that
these emotions are enjoyable irrespective of whether they are sad or joyful and have an
undeniable healing eﬀect can be interpreted in terms of the presence of the negentropic
entanglement.
For instance, the ability of good music to generate vibrations in spine
could relate to this negentropic aspects.
Music as purely intellectual experience could
induce essentially an analysis of what was heard based on the use of holistic-reductionistic
dichotomy. Chopin’s music has especially strong healing eﬀect. Tempo rubato might reﬂect
the profound integration of rhytmic aspects, melodic, and harmonic to single organic whole
both at the level of representation and music experience.
3. The model of subjective memory and the new view about time might be relevant for the under-
standing of how the basic key of the music piece can be remembered. If conscious experience
for a given self is about the space-time region deﬁned by corresponding CD, one could under-
stand how Mozart was able to experience the entire composition as a single whole. If the music
piece deﬁnes in the ideal case the fundamental CD inside which the sub-selves representing the
elements of the music oiece reside, this CD could also deﬁne the fundamental ”key ” and would
be more or less sensorily experienced and need not even to be remembered. This would explain
why the return to the original key in classical is so important to relieve the tension created by
modulations.
Harmony and self-organization
The phenomenon of harmony should be somehow related to quantum self-organization: perhaps the
often used metaphor of harmonious co-existence could be turned around. Various notes correspond to
sub-selves in the population of sub-selves and it might be that self-organization favours simultaneous
conscious existence of sub-selves corresponding to subsets of frequencies deﬁning basic chords. One
could even consider some kind of co-operation between the frequency selves belonging to same basic
chord.
The simplest model for the phenomenon of harmony relies on the identiﬁcation of the chords as
’chord selves’ formed by entangled ’note selves’ consisting of negentropically entangled ’frequency
selves’. The listener is self having as sub-selves (mental images) note selves and chord selves which
correspond to the same level of the self hierarchy.
The entanglement between note selves could
occur even at the level of ear between the mindlike space-time sheets sensitive to various frequencies.
Topologically it would correspond to the formation of magnetic ﬂux tubes between corresponding
partonic 2-surfaces. The ability of the ’note selves’ of the chord to have stable ﬂux tube bonds between
themselves should depend crucially on the fact that the frequencies of the notes of the basic chords
have simple rational ratios so that the oscillations involved are commensurate and match together.
Hence a resonance phenomenon ins spirit of classical physics involving rational ratios of frequencies
would be in question. During listening the chord self continually decomposes into sub-selves when
listener consciously concentrates attention to some notes in the chord.
The ability of the music to occasionally create thrills in spine could correspond to whole-body con-
sciousness in unusually large length scale. Note the this scale could correspond also to the secondary
time length scale assignable to CD. It presumably involves a resonant fusion of also other than note
sub-selves to larger negentropic sub-selves by the formation of stable join along boundaries bonds
identiﬁable as magnetic ﬂux tubes. The ability of certain sounds (’Om’) to promote the emergence of
whole-body consciousness could be due to the ability to very eﬀectively generate negentropic entan-
glement direction. Perhaps the frequency spectrum of ’Om’ contains resonant frequencies of several

223
sub-selves and induces large sub-selves. Also the healing eﬀect of music and sounds could rely on this
mechanism.
Focusing attention to some instrument producing melody creates kind of ﬁgure-background rela-
tionship. This requires that entire instrument playing the melody is represented by ’instrument self’.
An interesting possibility is that various instruments give rise to their own ensembles of frequency-
selves. Note that the model makes it easy to understand why experienced performance is not simply
the sum of invidividual performances. Music experience is a complicated self-organization process in
which parts compose to wholes by quantum entanglement and vice versa according to how the listener
directs his/her attention.
4.5
Whole-body consciousness: physical evidence and tests
Whole-body consciousness is one of the predictions of the proposed theory and anomalously low
dissipation can be regarded as the most dramatic physical signature of whole-body consciousness.
This prediction provides a manner to test the theory.
4.5.1
Dissipation and consciousness
The state function reduction sequence is a binary process which at a given step splits a subsystem into
a unique pair of un-entangled subsystems if the subsystem allows decomposition to free entropically
entangled systems. The process is random and explains second law and dissipation as a transformation
of ordered energy to non-ordered energy. In standard view about self-organization the generation of
structures requires a feed of ordered energy to compensate the dissipation.
In TGD framework the function of the metabolic energy feed would be more complex than this.
Energy feed is necessary in order to avoid the formation of large sized entropically bound subselves.
The feeded energy need not be ordered. The rate of dissipation depends on how small the scale of the
non-decomposable systems is. If negentropic entanglement binds mental images to larger ones, the
rate of dissipation is expected to be low. Ordered metabolic energy can be also transformed to the
energy carried by negentropic entanglement and liberated as the entanglement transforms to ordinary
free or bound state entanglement.
The overall picture is also made more complex by the simultaneous presence of several length
scales in which the state function reduction process proceeds so that it makes sense to speak about
quantum parallel dissipation.
EEG waves and parallel information processing
Parallel information processing requires a large number of correlated units acting in parallel. If the
units correspond to sub-selves which are bound state entangled, the whole system acts like a single
neuron so that the information processing is very un-eﬀective. If the system consists of unentangled
subselves, the correlations are absent and the system is analogous to a statistical ensemble rather than
a quantum parallel computer. If the entanglement is negentropic, one achieves parallel information
processing since subselves are correlated but have not lost their degrees of freedom.
In synesthesia synchronous ﬁring is observed and the cognitive and memory feats of synesthetes
suggest that parallel information processing and negentropic entanglement are involved. Therefore
synchronous ﬁring and its EEG counterpart deﬁne candidates for the physical correlates of the negen-
tropic entanglement. TGD inspired model for EEG and nerve pulse predicts both propagating EEG
waves associated with neural circuits and non-propagating EEG waves associated with entire regions
of brain (say gap junction connected cell groups) [K65] .
It would be natural to assign non-propagating EEG waves to synchronous ﬁring of neurons forming
a single coherent unit. However, if neurons form a bound state they act in unisono and the information
processing is very uneﬀective. Hence both propagating and non-propagating EEG waves should be
present during parallel information processing periods and add up coherently. Synchrony would mean
that standing wave part of EEG is for neurons like the rhythm of music for a ballet group. Coherence
of EEG, one form of ’oneness’, would be the correlate for presence of both reductionistic and holistic
aspects of consciousness.

224
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
Evidence and tests for a reduced metabolism as concomitant of whole-body consciousness
Consider now possible evidence and tests for the reduced metabolism as a signature of whole-body
consciousness.
1. In synesthesia diﬀerent sensory modalities are associated with a regular manner just as thoughts
are associated with speech. A dramatic signature of synesthesia is the lowering of the cortical
metabolism by as much as about 18 per cent from the average (synesthete should become blind
or paralyzed if standard wisdom would hold true!). This is what is expected if the neurons
of left cortex get entangled. Also a large scale entanglement weith parts of limbic brain, with
sensory organs associated with coupled sensory modalities, and magnetic body is possible. The
extended self in state of oneness does not dissipate signiﬁcantly.
2. The metabolism of trained yogis provides a test for the hypothesis: measure some signatures
for neuronal or cellular dissipation occurred during the meditative state and ﬁnd whether the
dissipation is reduced during meditation. The lowered dissipation rate could even lead to the
lowering of the body temperature or the temperature of nearby region.
3. There are even anecdotal claims about the ability of the dead bodies of gurus to resist natural
decay. I am not certainly trying to convince any sceptic and, still having very living personal
body, I have no personal opinions about the reality of the claimed phenomena. It would be
however good to be open-minded.
4. There is (I believe well documented) phenomenon in which persons in trance are able to dance
on burning charcoals without any disastrous consequences. Certainly there are standard science
explanations for this. A possible nonstandard sicence explanation is that state of a whole-body
consciousness is involved and no dissipation in cellular scale occurs. Since dissipation is not
possible, the irreversible eﬀects caused by the heatﬂow from burning charcoals are not possible
and only reversible and curable eﬀects can occur.
5. The reduction of the dissipation rate in some length scales should occur also during sleep, which
is one example of this kind of state (obviously a reduction of metabolism occurs).
6. Also hypnosis might involve (possibly negentropic) quantum entanglement between some part
of the brain of subject person and hypnotizer. This could reﬂect itself as correlations between
EEGs of hypnotizer and subject person.
4.5.2
EEG synchrony and negentropic entanglement
If one accepts the vision about life as something in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds 40
Hz EEG synchrony can be interpreted as a correlate for the generation of negentropic entanglement
between cortical neurons. Before proposing this interpretation let us ﬁrst describe the experimental
ﬁndings of a ﬁnnish neuroscientist Antti Revonsuo [J114] .
Findings
The interpretation for 40 Hz EEG frequency inspired by the binding hypothesis is as a synchronizing
frequency necessary for the generation of uniﬁed percepts. This hypothesis has been studied using
auto-stereograms [J114] . There was no detectable diﬀerence in the power spectrum at 36-44 Hz range
in the situation when auto-stereogram was experienced as a set of random dots as compared to the
situation when it was perceived as a coherent, symmetrical gestalt. The situation was same also in
8-13 Hz and 13-20 Hz beta bands. The ﬁnding is consistent with the place coding hypothesis.
On the other hand, when the conscious percept was transformed from a random set of points to a
coherent gestalt, there was a detectable increase in 40 Hz power in the occipital and right posterior
sites for EEG electrodes in a time window 500-300 ms before the uniﬁed percept was reported. There
could be also some time lapse between the uniﬁed percept and the report about it but probably this
cannot explain the entire lapse. No increase of power in beta bands was detected: this might be due
to the fact that the widths of the measured bands are much wider than the widths of the narrow
sub-bands reported masked by other EEG activity according to [J93] . Note that in the model for a

4.5. Whole-body consciousness: physical evidence and tests
225
hierarchy of EEGs based on dark matter hierarchy beta band correspond to data communicated to
the magnetic body [K21] .
That the change in activity is associated with the emergence of a new percept suggests that the
temporary increase of the EEG power could be assigned to the communications of the forming percept
to the magnetic body.
Interpretation in terms of generation of negentropic entanglement
A fresh view about what really happens during 40 Hz synchrony came with the realization that
negentropic entanglement is possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. The generation
of negentropic entanglement between two subselves means that the corresponding mental images are
fused [K81, K44] . The process is experienced by the fusing subselves as an expansion of consciousness
whereas consciousness is lost when when bound state entanglement is generated. Also the meditative
states begin with enchanged 40 Hz activity and the interpretation would be same. Quite generally,
the generation of negentropically entangled neuron groups could be a correlate for the emergence of
a new idea or a new holistic pattern emerging from a chaos. Synchronous ﬁring would be a natural
correlate for the synergic state resulting in this manner. The paradoxical looking reduction of the
oxiditative metabolism associated with 40 Hz ﬁring could be seen as a signature of reduced dissipation
when dissipating ensemble of neurons forms a single quantum coherent system.
What could then be the interpretation of the 300-500 ms time scale and synchronous ﬁring in TGD
framework?
1. If one assumes that only brain is involved, one must answer whether the new percept emerges
after such a long time period. One would naively expect that negentropic entanglement im-
mediately gives rise to the percept. Negentropic entanglement however means that a quantum
superposition of several alternative percepts is involved. In the beginning the new percept is
present with only small probability so that one would only know that the moment of heureka
is quite near (this is indeed the experience that one has) and in the ﬁnal situation it dominates
but not completely since it requires conscious eﬀort to preserve the percept.
2. Also magnetic body should be involved in TGD framework. The natural question is ”Why this
synchronous neuronal ﬁring?”. The natural answer would be that it allows to communicate the
new percept as a consequence of a generation of negentropic entanglement to the magnetic body.
The frequency scale of 40 Hz corresponds to a time scale of 25 milliseconds and corresponds to
a length scale involved is about .75 × 107 m, a good candidate for the size of the part of the
magnetic body involved. This time scale is much shorter than 300-500 seconds. If the layer of the
magnetic body in question corresponds to the fundamental 100 millisecond time scale assignable
to electron as is natural in case of sensory percepts, the time lapse could be essentially due to
the communication. If one takes the time scale literally the value of Planck constant which is
about 3 to 5 larger than its standard value would suggest itself. Of course, the development
of the percept from a fuzzy inkling to the ﬁnal heureka could involve several communication
loops between brain and magnetic body so that the interpretation as a lapse due the slowness
of communications need not be inconsistent with the ﬁrst interpretation.
3. The time scale 300-500 ms could characterize the duration of negentropic entanglement but
this is not necessarily the case since negentropic entanglement would be un-necessary after the
percept has been represented symbolically so that one knows what is lurking behind the chaos.
4.5.3
Synesthesia
Synesthesia [J48] seems to give a direct experimental evidence for a reduced rate of metabolism in
’negentropic’ states of mind. Synesthesia provides an excellent counter argument against the idea that
sensory organs are primary experiencers unless one is ready to believe that cross-modal associations
involve macroscopic quantum systems formed by the primary sensory organs involved and parts of
brain.
TGD based quantum model for EEG and nerve pulse suggest that synesthesia is a natural by-
product of the negentropic states of mind involving enchanced EEG in large regions of brain. Coherent
large amplitude EEG induces synchronous neural ﬁring in memory circuit containing hippocampus

226
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
and thalamus. This leads to a ’leakage’ or nerve pulse activity in lateral thalamic nuclei from inducing
sensory pathway to the indced sensory pathway.
An interesting possibility is that the non-propagating EEG waves predicted by TGD [K65] and
possibly explaining the ability of right brain hemisphere to process information in a parallel manner
are involved in synesthesia. The left brain hemisphere of synesthetes would be in some aspects like
the right one during synesthesia and right and left brain could act like single conscious unit during
synestesia.
Does synesthesia involve left cortex whole-body consciousness?
The following aspects of synesthesia suggest that left cortex whole-body consciousness might be in-
volved with it.
1. Synesthesia depends on left brain hemisphere only.
A dramatic signature of synesthesia is
the lowering of the metabolism in the left cortex by about even 18 per cent compared to the
baseline (synesthete should become blind or paralyzed if standard wisdom holds true!). This is
accompanied by relatively enhanced limbic expression. Hippocampus, which is believed to be
crucial for long term memories, is critical for the synesthetic experience.
2. Synesthesia is emotional: the experiences are accompanied by a sense of certainty (’this is it’)
feeling. This is in accordance with the observation that limbic brain expression is enhanced.
3. Holism is an important aspect of synesthesia. Synesthetes can precisely remember entire pas-
sages of text (which actually means that also reductionistic aspect is present), re-experience
entire episodes of previous life, remember precise locations of various objects in a room. Synes-
thetic experiences are emotional. Synesthetes also tend to have ’unusual experiences’ like deja
vu, clairvoyance and pre-cognitive dreams. This kind of personality constellation characterizes
temporal-limbic epileptics.
4. Synesthetes have un-even cognitive skills.
Dyslexia, dyscalculia in some degree, inability to
transform words to digits, right-left confusion, etc.. Synesthetes are also non-right-handed.
A possible TGD based interpretation is that part of the left cortex is in whole-body consciousness
in the sense that mental images have fused negentropically to very few larger mental images and there
are very few unentangled sub-selves (mental images).
1. In this state left cortex does not dissipate as much as usually. Negentropic entanglement explains
why the metabolism can be reduced during synesthesia below the level causing death under
normal circumstances. The relative enhancement of metabolism in left limbic brain could relate
to emotionality but does not favor negentropic entanglement in left limbic brain.
2. Also the cognitive impairments can be understood. The negentropic entanglement is both time-
like and space-like so that these sub-selves have also a long duration. The resulting experience
is holistic both in spatial and time direction with overall gestalt being more important than
details.
A good temporal resolution is essential for the mentioned cognitive skills and the
explanation for cognitive dis-abilities is that entangled left cortex does not generate temporal
sequences of sub-selves of short duration deﬁning the mental clock readings or beacons. The
mental images are extremely informative but the the lack of linguistic expression based on the
replacement of the percept with a collection of distinct objects mapped to linguistic symbols
disfavors this mode of consciousness. Therefore linguistic cognition is favored by the practicalities
of the everyday social life. The lack of asymmetry between brain hemispheres behind holism-
reductionism dichotomy essential for language would naturally relate to non-right-handedness
and the diﬃculty to distinguish between right and left. This inability would also conform with
the view that some regions of right and left hemisphere are negentropically entangled.
3. The exceptional episodal memory achievements could be understood as a formation of large
scale negentropic mental images which are stable so that long sequences of events of geometric
past are re-experienced. In [K64] a model for long term episodal memories as questions sent to
the geometric past inducing time-like entanglement with the self of the geometric past making

4.5. Whole-body consciousness: physical evidence and tests
227
possible episodal memory as a shared sensory experience is discussed. The question sent to
the geometric past is coded to the lightlike vacuum current associated with a stationary ME,
usually in right brain but in left brain in case of synesthesia. The time like entanglement of
the space-time sheets located in the geometric now and past (or future in case of clairvoyance)
makes possible the episodal memory.
The proposed mechanism could also explain both the extraordinary memory feats of some autistic
persons and their diﬃculties with the challenges of the everyday life. Dramatic example is a person
able to draw from memory an area of London with size of several square kilometers as seen from
air. The same person draws from memory a building having hundreds of windows and the number of
windows comes out correctly although this same person is not able to count corretly the number of
three objects. As in the case of synesthetes cognitive impairments could be necessary prequisites of the
extraordinary gifts. Although the person cannot count how many windows the mental image of the
building has, he can draw them correctly just by drawing along the image he sees in full concreteness.
Basic observations
The following observations provide a valuable information making possible to construct a more detailed
model of synesthesia.
1. Synesthesia is in-voluntary and usually uni-directional: for instance, auditory experience creates
visual association but not vice versa. Cross-modal associations, just like ordinary associations,
do not change in the course of time. It has not been possible to ﬁnd any rule telling which kind
of associations are possible. It seems that cross-associated experiences are however generic and
simple so that one can speak of form invariants which are kind of primitive building blocks of
perception: for instance, visual associations tend to be blobs, lines, spirals and lattice shapes.
2. Synesthesia is projected: synesthetes experience their secondary sensory experiences in the space
in the immediate surroundings of the body, never at large distances as is in principle possible in
the case of vision and hearing. For instance, visual associations are seen on screen near to eyes.
3. The reduction of the metabolism is concentrated in the cortical regions whereas relatively en-
hanced metabolism occurs in the limbic brain, in particular hippocampus. Seizure discharges
in hippocampus induce synesthesia in non-synesthetes: associations are simple experiences and
become more complicated if seizures spread to the temporal lobes. The exceptional activity of
hippocampus correlates with the exceptional ability to have precise episodal memories.
4. According to [J48] it is very rare that taste or smell is a synesthetic response or trigger of it.
In fact that author of the articles knows no case in which smell alone would be the inducing
sensory modality. This could relate to the fact that olfactorion is exceptional sensory modality
in the sense that there are two olfactory pathways: the ﬁrst one projects directly to amygdala
whereas second projects to cortex via thalamus as do also the sensory pathways associated with
order sensory modalities [J54] . Furthermore, the olfactory pathway to the thalamus projects to
the medial dorsal nuclei whereas other sensory pathways project to the lateral dorsal nuclei.
5. Synesthesia can also generate sensory-motor associations. For instance, visual input can generate
well deﬁned motor outputs and synesthete can express sensory experiences by dancing!
Memory coordination circuit and Papez circuits as brain circuits possibly involved with
synesthesia
Hippocampus is believed to be crucial for the formation and experiencing of long term memories.
This suggests that an enhanced activity in some neural circuits involving hippocampus in a form of
increased EEG amplitudes (at theta frequencies) is essential for generating the sensory leakage between
neural circuits and sensory pathways leading to synesthesia. For this kind of mechanism synesthetic
mode need not be the only mode of experiencing: ordinary and synesthetic modes could also alternate.
If synesthetic and non-synesthetic periods alternate, synesthesia cannot interfere radically with the
real experience. This is clearly the safest option and perhaps favoured by natural selection. The
ability to control theta wave amplitudes in hippocampus could make possible an artiﬁcial generation
of synesthesia.

228
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
There are two important circuits going through hippocampus [J106] . The ﬁrst circuit is memory
coordination circuit having the following structure:
1. Lateral dorsal nucleus and anterior nuclear group of the thalamus
2. Cingulate cortex
3. Subiculum and the rest of the hippocampal formation with input via entorhinal cortex and
output via the subiculum and fornix
4. Back to 1.
Fornix is known to be the circuit responsible for slow theta rhytm of about 3-7 Hz, which does not
correspond to a conscious experience: thus memory coordination circuit is believed to be unconscious
to us under normal circumstances [J106] .
Temporal cortex contains a region which projects to
hippocampus and receives input from all sensory modalities. Memory circuit is believed to somehow
to provide a handle to the memory constellations believed to reside in the temporal lobes.
That
the EEG amplitude associated with the fornix would be exceptionally large during synesthesia is in
accordance with the fact that that synesthetes tend to have personal constellation of limbic-temporal
epileptics. Also the abnormal episodal memories (Nabokov is one of the best known synesthetes with
miraculous memory) supports resonance in this circuit. Only memory circuit projects to the thalamic
nuclei receiving both sensory and motor input. Hence also the occurrence of the motor synesthesia
supports the view that the sensory leakage occurs in the thalamic nuclei contained by the memory
circuit.
Papez circuit is second circuit containing hippocampus. Papez circuit has following structure:
1. Anterior nuclear group of the thalamus
2. Cingulate cortex

5. Back to 1.
The enhanged activity of the Papez circuit induced by the hippocampus could correlate with the
emotionality of the synesthetic experience.
The general picture about the sensory leakage
These observations and facts suggests the following general model for synesthesia.
1. Contrary to the original expectations, the hypothesis that the primary sensory qualia are as-
sociated with the sensory organs can be be defended against various objections if one assumes
that brain and sensory organs quantum entangle so that a fusion of sensory mental images with
cognitive mental images occurs. The hypothesis explains elegantly the diﬀerences between imag-
ination, dreaming, hallucinations, and ordinary sensory experience. Dreams and hallucinations
would involve a back projection from brain to sensory organs giving rise to a ”qualiaﬁcation” of
the cognitive mental images represented by the nerve pulse patterns. In the case of synesthesia
the back projection would assign to a sensory input from the inducing sensory modality an
artiﬁcial sensory input in the induced sensory modality.
2. If the cross-modal communication between sensory organs occurs through thalamic nuclei com-
mon to the cross-associated sensory modalities, one can understand why smells alone are never
the inducing sensory modalities. Lateral dorsal thalamic nuclei would be the sites of the sensory
leakage. Furthermore, in the case of hearing, vision, and tactile senses it is easy to produce
artiﬁcial sensory experience than in case of chemical senses (molecules attaching to the sensory
receptors would be required).

4.5. Whole-body consciousness: physical evidence and tests
229
3. The possibility of the sensory-motor synesthesia suggests that the back-projection involves ar-
tiﬁcial sensory input to the motor organs inducing a motor activity, which in TGD framework
corresponds to a geometric time reversal of the sensory perception starting from the level of
motor organs and proceeding in a time reversed direction. Only memory coordination circuit
involves thalamic nuclei receiving both sensory and motor inpuits. Memory coordination cir-
cuit involves lateral dorsal nuclei (all modalities except olfaction) but not medial dorsal nuclei
(olfaction). This leads to the hypothesis that the exceptionally high activity of the memory co-
ordination circuit induces a sensory leakage in the lateral dorsal nuclei of the thalamus belonging
to the memory coordination circuit.
Synesthesia as a sensory leakage between thalamic nuclei common to the memory coor-
dination circuit and primary sensory pathways
Synesthesia could be a byproduct of an abnormally large EEG amplitude in the memory coordination
circuit and possibly also Papez circuit inducing a ’leakage’ of nerve pulses between sensory pathways
in thalamus in turn giving rise to synesthetic crossmodal associations. That synesthetic associations
are projected, is consistent with the sensory leakage hypothesis.
The resonant EEG amplitude associated with the thalamic nuclei of the resonating memory coor-
dination circuit spreads out to the primary sensory or motor pathways in the physical vicinity of the
resonating pathway and generates a sensory leakage and a back projection to the sensory organs of
the induced modality thus inducing synesthesia. The structure of the synesthetic association is deter-
mined by the pattern of neurons activated and thus creating the virtual sensory input backprojected
to the sensory organ of the induced sensory modality. One can imagine each neuron as a pixel of a
sensory picture and the pattern of activated pixels determines the synesthetic association.
The model makes testable predictions.
1. The assumption that the sensory leakage occurs in the thalamus could be tested. One could
study whether the crossmodal associations change, when the sensory input from right or left
side of body is lacking. For instance, one could ﬁnd what happens if audio-to-visual synesthete
blocks left/right ear during audio-to-visual synesthesia.
2. The generation of artiﬁcial sensory experience by back-projection to the sensory organ of the
induced sensory modality means that a permanent or an artiﬁcially induced temporal loss of the
induced sensory modality (by a local anaesthesia of the axons of the sensory pathway) should
lead to the loss of the synesthesia.
How to understand the memory feats of synesthetes and the reduced metabolism in the
left hemisphere?
Negative energy MEs can be interpreted as classical signals sent to the geometric past, and they could
be crucial for an active memory recall involving a question sent from the magnetic body to the brain
of the geometric past as a negative energy ME. Also chemical signals- say very slow Ca++ wave inside
brain- could be involved and could deﬁne the classical response to the negative energy signal.
1. Memories and time mirror mechanism
Time mirror mechanism, which was ﬁrst developed in the framework of positive energy ontology,
is the simplest quantum mechanism of memory. Its recent formulation goes as follows.
1. The mechanism of episodal memory is assumed to involve only a sharing of mental images by
negentropic time-like quantum entanglement. The notion of bound state entanglement in time
direction need not make sense at all: the reason is that bound state energy is assigned with
the entire system rather than sub-systems and for zero energy states total energy is always
zero. Hence it seems better to assume that only negentropic entanglement and non-binding real
entanglement in time direction is possible.
2. The basic question is what really distinguishes between verbal (declarative) and episodal mem-
ories. Is the diﬀerence between verbal and episodal memories related only to the temporal size
scale of the negentropically entangled subsystems? In this case declarative memory would con-
sist of a sequence of short lasting episodal memories with contents which are symbols rather

230
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
than direct sensory perceptions with emotional content. Or can one interpret verbal memories
as purely classical communications between geometric past and future? This would make sense
if declarative memories result when an entropic entanglement between future and past selves
is reduced to zero so that the communications would reduce to those between non-living sys-
tems. Episodal memories would be possible in the intersection of the real and p-adic worlds and
declarative memories everywhere. This interpretation is consistent with the earlier vision.
One can model the memory recall as follows.
1. The view about memory recall is that a ’question’ realized as a negative energy ME is sent from
magnetic body to the brain of the geometric past, it is reﬂected back as a positive energy signal,
and returns back to the magnetic body. It is essential that the signal is between diﬀerent CDs
- say CD and its and sub-CD- rather than future and past boundaries of single CD.
2. One must be very careful with what negative energy signal really means. This signal would be
generated in quantum jump and should connect the past boundary of CD to the future boundary
of a CD in the geometric past- say for deﬁniteness a sub-CD of CD itself if personal memory
is in question. The condition that the positive energy of the past boundary of CD remains
unchanged means that the energy ﬂowing to the direction of future inside CD is increased as
a recoil eﬀect. The same applies in the case of sub-CD. This interaction could be seen as an
interaction between two CDs implying an exchange of energy between the positive energy parts
of the states.
3. The transfer of negative energy to the past can transform the positive energy part of the state
of the geometric past to a bound state in the ordinary sense of the word. If positive energy
negentropic entanglement is in question this need not happen although the energy of the state is
reduced. Therefore negentropically entangled mental images are especially interesting from the
point of view of episodal memories. The question and answer fuse to a single negentropically
entangled mental image shared by the hemispheres of the geometric past and now. The negen-
tropy of the past state is expected to reduced as its energy is reduced so that quite literally a
ﬂow of information to future is in question.
4. Duality between memory and recognition suggests itself. What is memory from the point of
view of future CD could be precognition from the point of view of past CD.
The generation of negative energy MEs would involve a phase transition to a state in which
the positive MEs propagating along axons with a subluminal eﬀective phase velocity transform to
negative energy MEs leaving the brain and are reﬂected back in time direction. Synchronous membrane
oscillations could accompany negative energy MEs [K62] . If negative energy MEs are sent by the
region of the left brain hemisphere, it gains some energy by pay now-let others pay mechanism.
2. Reduction of metabolism during synesthesia
Episodal memories could relate to the reduction of the metabolism by 18 per cent during synes-
thesia.
1. The original interpretation proposed before the formulation of zero energy ontology was that
the generation of the negative energy MEs is forced by the starvation of the neurons induced by
the over-activity of the neurons of the memory coordination circuit. The miraculous ability of
synesthetes to remember episodally could be understood to result as a by-product of a neuronal
emergency reaction. The starving cortical neurons of the left hemisphere would send negative
energy MEs to the direction of the geometric past inducing entanglement bridges by the mirror
mechanism with the brain of the geometric past in turn inducing episodal long term memories by
the sharing of the mental images. The same mechanism might work also in the normal situation
but involve a less dramatic artiﬁcial starvation.
2. The reduction of the metabolism could be also mostly due to the negentropic entanglement
for the mental images in the left cortex ”now” so that the episodal memories realized in the
proposed manner would give only an additional reduction to metabolism.

4.6. Self hierarchy and the notion of magnetic body
231
3. Non-episodal memories
Also in the case of non-episodal memories the question to the geometric past could be communi-
cated by the mirror mechanism using negative energy MEs but now time-like entanglement would be
entropic free entanglement and would be reduced to zero in quantum jump so that the real answer
would be communicated classically.
1. The classical signal could return to the magnetic body along reﬂected positive energy ME so
that the question and answer could use the same cognitive code.
2. Second possibility is that signal returns back without leaving the brain. The classical signal sent
by the left hemisphere of the geometric past to the left hemisphere of the future would propagate
a ﬁnite distance L within brain in a time interval T deﬁning the temporal span of the memory
(say years) so that the ME would propagate with an eﬀective phase velocity v = L/T. The
velocities of Ca++ waves span an extremely wide spectrum and provide a natural candidate for
the physiological excitations in question [J74] .
3. Ca++ waves could be also be accompanied MEs with ultraslow phase velocities.
4.6
Self hierarchy and the notion of magnetic body
TGD not only predicts inﬁnite hierarchy of selves but also strongly suggests that ”me” as an intentional
agent should be identiﬁed as my ﬁeld body, or perhaps better to say, my magnetic body having an
astrophysical size. Magnetic body would also serve as an intentional agent and controlling biological
body by time mirror mechanism. An entire hierarchy of magnetic bodies is predicted since the ﬂux
quanta of each body part deﬁne corresponding magnetic body. Also the magnetic body of Earth
should deﬁne a conscious unit, kind of Magnetic Mother Gaia perhaps responsible for some third
person aspects of our consciousness. The role of the magnetic body would be like that of a manual
of an electronic instrument, that is it would provide a higher level representation for the body and
its environment. Magnetic body would also serve as template for the formation of bio-structures.
Magnetic body would share the mental images produced by brain as symbolic representations of the
sensory input. The basic theoretical arguments supporting the notion of magnetic body derive from p-
adic physics as physics of intention and cognition. Also time mirror mechanism of long term memories
and Uncertainty Principle applied to EEG provide support for the notion. Some experimental ﬁndings
supporting the notion of ﬁeld body are Libet’s ﬁndings, the role of Schumann resonance frequency
for consciousness about time delays of consciousness, and the eﬀects em radiation on brain and living
matter at cyclotron frequencies.
This original version of this section was written much before the emergence of the zero energy
ontology. A ﬁrst principle justiﬁcation for the notion of magnetic body is provided by zero energy
ontology predicting that primary p-adic length scales are accompanied by secondary p-adic length
scales (as well as time scales). For instance, in case of electron the secondary time scale is .1 seconds
and correspond to a length scale of order Earth’s circumference. It is natural to assign this time scale
to the ﬂux tubes of the magnetic body. This aspect will not be discussed explicitly in the sequel but
should be kept in mind.
Am important question concerns about actual biological realization of the self hierarchy predicted
to begin already at elementary particle level and continuing indeﬁnitely. TGD indeed leads to rather
concrete ideas about how this hierarchy is possibly realized.
4.6.1
Higher level selves in biological self hierarchy
The basic inputs for the speculations about the higher levels of the biological self hierarchy are topo-
logical ﬁeld quantization, the idea of memetic code and the observations about the eﬀects of EFL em
ﬁelds to brain suggesting that the higher levels correspond to em selves with sizes of order wavelength
of photons generated by EEG currents having size of order of Earth and realized as topological ﬁeld
quanta. The general view about symbiosis of hierarchies of massless extremals (MEs) and supercon-
ducting magnetic ﬂux tube structures with the ordinary matter at atomic space-time sheets provides
strong constraints on the speculations. The general vision about sensory representations realized in

232
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
terms of magnetic ﬂux tube structures outside brain [K64] and having sizes of ELF wavelengths leads
to rather concrete ideas about the self hierarchy and about our position in it.
Topological ﬁeld quantization
Topological ﬁeld quantization [K36] implies that various notions of quantum ﬁeld theory have rather
precise classical analogies. Topological ﬁeld quantization provides the correspondence between the
abstract Fock space description of elementary particles and the description of the elementary particles
as concrete geometric objects detected in the laboratory. In standard quantum ﬁeld theory this kind
of correspondence is lacking since classical ﬁelds are regarded as a phenomenological concept only.
Topological ﬁeld quanta deﬁne regions of coherence for the classical ﬁelds and classical coherence is
the prequisite of the quantum coherence.
The energies and other classical charges of the topological ﬁeld quanta are quantized since only
preferred extremals of K¨ahler action allow inﬁnite number of deformations with a vanishing second
variation: this makes classical space-time surfaces the counterparts of the Bohr orbits. Feynmann
diagrams become classical space-time surfaces with lines thickened to 4-manifolds.
For instance,
”massless extremals” [K55] representing topologically quantized classical radiation ﬁelds are the clas-
sical counterparts of gravitinos and photons. Topologically quantized non-radiative nearby ﬁelds give
rise to various geometric structures such as magnetic and electric ﬂux tubes.
The virtual particles of quantum ﬁeld theory have also classical counterparts. In particular, the
virtual particles of quantum ﬁeld theory can have negative energies: this is true also for the TGD
counterparts of the virtual particles. The fundamental diﬀerence between TGD and GRT is that in
TGD the sign of energy depends on the time orientation of the space-time sheet: this is due to the
fact that in TGD energy current is vector ﬁeld rather than part of tensor ﬁeld. Therefore space-time
sheets with negative energies are possible. This could have quite dramatic technological consequences:
consider only the possibility of generating energy from vacuum and classical signalling backwards in
time along negative energy space-time sheets [K5] . Also bioystems might have invented negative
energy space-time sheets: in fact, so called ”massless extremals” provide an ideal manner to generate
coherent motions as recoil eﬀects caused by the creation of negative energy massless extremals [K12] .
An interesting possibility is that quantum entanglement has the formation of the join along boundaries
bonds as its geometric correlate.
The hypothesis of topological self-referentiality stating that the topological ﬁeld quanta of classical
ﬁelds form a symbolic representation for the system’s properties, provides a strong interpretative tool.
For instance, bound state entanglement is represented by negative energy MEs and the generation
of macroscopic bound states essential for the binding of the mental images is accompanied by the
liberation of the binding energy as a usable energy. Hence the ability of the system to behave as a
single coherent whole and nonlocal quantum metabolism are diﬀerent sides of the same coin. The
concept of ﬁeld body (or electromagnetic body) consisting of the topological ﬁeld quanta is also of
central importance.
Field body could be seen as a ’manual’ for the system providing a classical,
topological representation for the quantum aspects of the material part of the system. The size of this
ﬁeld body is much larger than the material body of the system.
Topological ﬁeld quanta (ﬁeld bodies) could serve as templates for the formation of the biostruc-
tures. Thus topologically quantized classical electromagnetic ﬁelds could be equally important for the
functioning of the living systems as the structures formed by the visible biomatter and the visible part
of biosystem might represent only a tip of an ice berg.
Topologically quantized classical ﬁelds as templates for self hierarchy?
The web like structure formed by topological ﬁeld quanta representing classical ﬁelds, in particular
em ﬁelds, is remiscent of structures formed by microtubules and collagens forming the connecting
tissue of living systems. It has been already earlier suggested that magnetic ﬂux tubes and other
topological ﬁeld quanta serve as templates for various biostructures in the sense that ordinary matter
is topologically condensed on the ﬂux tube like structures. This would mean that living systems would
be only part of much larger web formed by Earth’s classical em ﬁeld forming one particular sub-self
of Mother Gaia.
The thickness for the ﬂux tubes of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is about 2/
√
eB ≃4 × 10−6 meters for
B = .5 × 10−4 Tesla. If magnetic ﬂux tubes of Earth have direct geometric coupling with brain one

4.6. Self hierarchy and the notion of magnetic body
233
could perhaps understand the miraculous ability of birds and bees to navigate using Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld. The proteins navigating along microtubules, cells navigating along collagen ﬁbres and birds
navigating along Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld lines would all be guided by higher level self!
One could
see also humans and the societies formed by them as continually self-organizing organs in the body
of electromagnetic Mother Gaia. In this picture the so narrow wave cavity of radius 80 km between
Earth’s surface and ionosphere could be like brain of Earth, which is very sensitive to the conditions of
ionosphere and biosphere and has ”biofeedback” coupling with living systems. The eﬀect of oscillatory
phenomena (sound, radiations and magnetic ﬁelds) at frequencies Schumann resonances on brain to
be discussed below supports also the direct interaction of our brain with Mother Gaia via Earth’s
electromagnetic ﬁeld.
It is interesting to notice that the ratio of the thickness of solar corona (106 m) to the radius of
Sun (5×108 m), the height of the wave cavity of Earth (80 km) to Earth radius (7×106 m), the ratio
of the thickness of grey matter of cortex (1 mm) to the size of human brain lobe (10 cm) as well as the
the ratio of the thickness of cell membrane (10−8 m) to the radius of neuron (2.5×10−6) have roughly
the same value of order 10−2. Thus it seems that cell membrane, cortex, electromagnetic cavity of
Earth and solar corona might have similar role in the self hierarchy.
The web formed by topological ﬁeld quanta of the classical em and ﬁelds continues to arbitrary long
length scales. For instance, the ﬂux tube structure of solar magnetic ﬁeld provides an explanation for
the anomalously high temperature of solar corona and a model for solar spot cycle [K73] . Perhaps also
Sun is a conscious self forming part of ”Indra’s net” representing electromagnetic and other classical
ﬁelds of cosmos.
Since the four CP2 coordinates are the primary dynamical variables, one must
consider the possibility that topologically quantized classical gauge ﬁelds and classical gravitational
ﬁeld could form rather independent sub-selves.
Possible geometric correlates of entanglement?
The geometric correlate for the entanglement between sub-systems is the generation of join along
boundaries bonds combining the corresponding 3-surfaces to single 3-surface: this is nothing but the
direct touching of the 3-surfaces. Actually, all that is needed is the fusion of the space-time sheets
of same local topology (real or p-adic) to single sheet. The entanglement generated in this manner
can be preserved even when direct geometrical contact between 3-surfaces is not present anymore. In
TGD based model for brain these bonds are formed between parts of brain and sensory organs.
One can consider several models for join along boundaries bonds. Topological ﬁeld quantization
providing general description of classical gauge and gravitational ﬁelds in TGD framework implies
that magnetic and electric ﬂux tubes and ”massless extremals” (MEs) are the basic building blocks
of classical em ﬁelds. All these structures can serve as join along boundaries bonds.
MEs are especially interesting candidates for space-time correlates of time like entanglement be-
tween positive and negative energy parts of zero energy states. MEs are very general solutions of ﬁeld
equations of TGD and have properties making them ideal for realizing basic functions of biosystems.
1. MEs represent propagation of classical gauge ﬁelds with light velocity and can carry non-
vanishing vacuum em currents and hence give rise to coherent photons. A tentative identiﬁ-
cation is as biophotons of Popp [I13] . The hypothesis is that MEs make possible generation
of quantum entanglement between brain and sensory organs. In this manner they provide a
realization for neuronal window idea generalizing the idea about hologramic brain [K14] . MEs
could make possible both classical (quantum) communication by the propagation of classical
ﬁelds (coherent photons) along them and neuron could literally have a window to external world
via sensory organ.
2. In TGD framework space-time sheets with negative time orientation are possible and carry
negative classical energies (in General Relativity this is not possible). The generation of negative
energy MEs provides ”buy now, pay later” type mechanism for energy production. Generation
of negative energy ME is classical counterpart for the generation of virtual particle and it is to
be expected that the subjective lifetime of negative energy MEs is ﬁnite number of quantum
jumps. Thus organism must eventually ”pay”, that is to compensate for the dissipation of the
energy gained by the generation of the ME by metabolism. Therefore metabolism is still needed.
Even more, organism must be able to give guarantees that it can pay! The ability to provide
these guarantees is perhaps one of the great achievements of the biological evolution.

234
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
3. MEs carry large momentum since all Fourier components of the gauge ﬁelds have parallel lightlike
momenta.
Since classical 4-momentum is lightlike, the amount 3-momentum per energy is
maximal. Thus, if the system is able to generate ME by quantum jump, it gains automatically
large recoil momentum. Hence MEs could provide the fundamental mechanism making possible
the coherent macroscopic motion of living systems. Negative energy ME of this kind might be
identiﬁable as a mindlike space-time sheet representing the geometric correlate for the conscious
decision to move.
4. MEs represent dispersionless propagation of a pulse preserving its shape and are thus ideal for
classical communication. If negative energy MEs are possible, one can imagine a mechanism of
”real subjective time” communication between selves of either geometric past or future having
arbitrarly large timelike distance. This idea is not conﬂict with standard classical causality at
given space-time sheet. Needless to say, this kind of possibility would realize concretely the
idea about four-dimensional society and revolutionize our view about universe: living beings
separated by billions of light years could in principle have ”real subjective time” chat.
4.6.2
Support for the notion magnetic body
There exists both theoretical and empirical support for the notion of magnetic body.
Theoretical support
1. EEG and Uncertainty Principle
There are good reasons to expect that EEG is accompanied by radiation, which in TGD framework
has topological light rays as space-time correlates. Typical EEG frequencies correspond to wavelengths
λ = c/f which for which natural length scale unit is Earth size. Thus Uncertainty Principle suggests
that structures of at least this size are involved with the self hierarchy associated with the brain.
2. p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intentionality
p-Adic physics as physics of intentionality and cognition is a fundamental key idea of TGD in-
spired theory of consciousness. p-Adic space-time sheets as correlates for intentions and p-adic-to-real
transformations of them as correlates for the transformation of intentions to actions allow deeper
understanding of also psychological time as a front of p-adic-to-real transition propagating to the
direction of the geometric future. Negative energy MEs are absolutely essential for the understanding
of how precisely targeted intentionality is realized.
Intentional behavior means that there is unpredictability in short time scales but predictability in
long time scales because system can realize its long term plans and use its partially free will to cope
with the changing challenges of the everyday life.
p-Adic topology diﬀers radically from real topology in the sense that p-adically inﬁnitesimal is
inﬁnite in real sense.
1. The rational values of real and p-adic imbedding space coordinates correspond to the same
points of the generalized imbedding space (essentially union of real and p-adic imbedding spaces
for various values of p with rational points common to all number ﬁelds and also points, in
particular points with algebraic number valued coordinates, shared by diﬀerent number ﬁelds in
a pair-wise manner identiﬁed).
2. The points, which are p-adically close to each other can have arbitrarily long real distance since
the points x and x + kpn, k ∈{0, p −1}, become arbitrarily near to each other p-adically and
arbitrarily far way in real sense as n increases for the p-adic topology characterized by prime p.
This means that intentionality and cognition are literally cosmic phenomena and evolution of
cognition and intentionality proceeds from long p-adic length scales to short ones in real sense (but
from short to long scales in p-adic sense). The carving of a statue by starting from a rough sketch and
adding details gradually is a good metaphor for what is involved. Development of any motor skill, say
piano playing, is an excellent example of what happens.
Intentions are transformed to action in a phase transition changing p-adic space-time sheet to a
real one. This process is most probable when real and p-adic space-time sheets have maximal number

4.6. Self hierarchy and the notion of magnetic body
235
of common rational points. Hence one expects that intentions can be transformed to large space-time
sheets and topological ﬁeld quanta are best candidates for these space-time sheets. Pairs of positive
and negative energy topological light rays and negative energy topological light rays generated in
the dropping of particles to larger space-time sheets, provide an example realizations of intentions.
Also wormhole magnetic ﬁelds consisting of pair of space-time sheets carrying magnetic ﬁelds of equal
intensity and having opposite time orientations could be generated intentionally.
3. Time mirror mechanism of long term memories
TGD based model of long term memory requires no storage of memories of past to the brain of
the geometric now. The memories are in the geometric past as dynamical self organization patterns
and subject to changes.
1. In the case of active memory recall the desire to remember is communicated to the geometric past
by sharing and fusion of mental images made possible by entanglement. In the case of episodal
memories also the memory recall would result in this manner. For non-episodal memories the
memory would be communicated from the geometric past using classical communications.
2. In the case of episodal memories active precisely targeted memory recall might be diﬃcult
since the entanglement with a correct mental image seems to require good luck. In principle
it is possible to select the distance T to the geometric past where the memory comes from by
selecting the fundamental frequency of ME.
3. The most natural manner to realize the time mirror mechanism is to regard magnetic body as the
system communicating with the brain of the geometric past serving as mirror. The fundamental
frequency f = c/L of associated with a topological light ray of length L would naturally code
for the time span of the long term memory as T = L/c in the sense that only these memories
would be communicated resonantly. Thus the distance from brain along magnetic ﬂux tubes
would code the time span of the memory. Long term memories with a span of order lifetime
however require that the size of the magnetic body involved is measured in light decades.
Experimental support for the notion of magnetic body
The work of Blackman and other pioneers of bio-electromagnetism concerning the eﬀects of ELF
(extremely low frequency) em ﬁelds on brain [J139] discussed in [K21] , provides dramatic support for
this idea and also a concrete view about how brain manages to act as macroscopic quantum system.
The currents generating EEG certainly create weak electromagnetic radiation ﬁelds which in TGD
framework correspond to topological ﬁeld quanta of size of Earth having natural coupling to the
magnetic ﬂux tubes.
The lowest Schumann frequency is roughly c/2πR, R radius of Earth, and equal to ω ≃8 Hz. It
is known that EEG frequencies are in the same frequency range as so called Schumann frequencies
8, 14, 21 ,... Hz [F4] associated with the resonances of the electromagnetic ﬁelds in the 80 km thick
wave cavity between Earth surface and ionosphere. The higher EEG frequencies seem to correlate
with higher Schumann resonance frequencies: in particular, the frequencies 13 and 39 Hz which are
also cyclotron resonance frequencies of Na+, are very near to Schumann frequencies.
Schumann
frequencies vary in time and it has been found that also the variations of EEG frequencies correlate
with this variation.
Magnetic perturbations near Schumann frequencies are known to have profound eﬀects on hu-
man brain inducing altered states of consciousness and cortical instabilities such micro-seizures and
epilepsies [J98].
The photons generated by Josephson currents associated with macroscopic ionic
BE condensates have wavelengths of order Earth size and the topological ﬁeld quanta representing
classically the radiation ﬁeld have size of Earth.
The explanation of the eﬀects related to water memory [I15, I35] suggests that similar magnetic
eﬀects appear at much wider frequency range than ELF frequencies which would mean that the super-
conducting magnetic ﬂux tube circuitries form a fractal hierarchy. The ﬁndings challenging the notions
of ionic pumps and channels [I31] provide additional strong support for the notion of many-sheeted
space-time and hierarchy of super-conducting of magnetic ﬂux tubes. The evidence for the fractal
hierarchy of magnetic ﬂux tubes is discussed in [K10, K11] .

236
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
These observations support the view that our ”physical” body is only a tip of an iceberg and
formed by the topological condensation of the bio-matter around electromagnetic topological ﬁeld
quanta serving as templates for the bio-structures.
The ﬁndings of Libet [J56] about time delays associated with the passive aspects of conscious
experience suggest that our sensor perceptions are a fraction of second old (.3-.5 seconds). This could
be understood if the sensory percepts from brain are communicated to the magnetic body identiable
as ’us’. This particular time scale would correspond to a layer of magnetic body which has 3-5 times
the size scale of electron’s CD which is about .78 times the circumference. A possible interpretation
is in terms of dark electrons with a value of Planck constant which is 3-5 times the standard value.
The corresponding EEG frequencies would vary in region .33-.2 Hz.
Cyclotron resonances as key to quantum consciousness
The estimate for the thickness of the magnetic ﬂux tubes of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld based on the
quantization of the magnetic ﬂux is about cell size. There is direct evidence for the hypothesis that
ions in the magnetic ﬁeld of .2 Gauss (Earth’ magnetic ﬁeld has nominal strength of BE = .5 Gauss)
form quantum states with the characteristic energies of order 10−14 eV and size of the orbit being of
order 2/
√
eB, that is cell size: in fact, the value .5×10−4 Tesla for Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld corresponds
to the length scale L(169) ≃5 µm rather precisely. This length scale is indeed the p-adic length scale
which seems to correspond to our sensory consciousness and various macroscopic quantum phases
seem to reside at k = 169 space-time sheets probably forming join along boundaries condensates. The
work of Blackman and other pioneers of bioelectromagnetism concerning the eﬀects of ELF (extremely
low frequency) em ﬁelds on brain [J139] provides dramatic support for this idea and also a concrete
view about how brain manages to act as macroscopic quantum system.
The discovery of Blackman means that frequencies having special eﬀect on biomatter correspond to
cyclotron resonances for ions like Ca++, Na+, K+ and Cl−in magnetic ﬁeld B = 2BE/5 = .2 Gauss.
The cyclotron frequency for Ca++ is 15 Hz whereas the remaining frequencies are in the range 7 −13
Hz (theta waves) at which also the most important Schumann resonances lie. The cyclotron frequency
5.5 Hz of iron is also a bio-active frequency and is the lower edge of theta region of EEG. Also lower
frequencies resonant frequencies such as 2.4 (Iodium ion) are present. Even more remarkably, the
pattern of data forces to conclude that the interaction occurs at quantum level. This conclusion is is
dramatic conﬂict with the predictions of the standard quantum theory and with the standard view
about space-time but consistent with the many-sheeted space-time concept of TGD.
A confession is in order: for years I erratically believed that the magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld
assignable to the biological body is BE = .5 Gauss, the nominal value of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
Probably I had made the calculational error at very early stage when taking Ca++ cyclotron frequency
15 Hz as a standard. I am grateful for Bulgarian physicist Rossen Kolarov for pointing to me that the
precise magnitude of the magnetic ﬁeld implying the observed 15 Hz cyclotron frequency for Ca++
is .2 Gauss and thus slightly smaller than the minimum value .3 Gauss of BE. This value must be
assigned to the magnetic body carrying dark matter rather than to the ﬂux quanta of the Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld. This ﬁeld value corresponds roughly to the magnitude of BE at distance 1.4R, R the
radius of Earth.
B = .2 Gauss would corresponds to a ﬂux tube radius L =
p
5/2 × L(169) ≃1.58L(169), which
does not correspond to any p-adic length scale as such. k = 168 = 23 ×3×7 with n = 5 would predict
the ﬁeld strength correctly as Bend = 2BE/5 and predict the radius of the ﬂux tube to be r = 25 µm,
size of a large neuron. However, k = 169 with ﬂux 2h5 would be must more attractive option since it
would give a direct connection with Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Furthermore, the model for EEG forces to
assume that also a ﬁeld Bend/2 must be assumed and this gives the minimal ﬂux h5. Note that n = 5
is the minimal value of n making possible universal topological quantum computation with Beraha
number Bn = 4cos2(π/n) equal to Golden Mean [K90] .
The conclusion that the eﬀect of ELF ﬁelds on brain represents quantum eﬀects associated with
the transitions of ions conﬁned in magnetic ﬁeld in the direction of axon carrying B = 2BE/5 = .2
Gauss , is supported by the following observations.
1. The frequencies 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 Hz having eﬀect on primates are multiples of the same basic
frequency f = 15 Hz, which turns out to be the cyclotron frequency of Ca++ ion. That these
frequencies come in multiples is a direct signature of quantum: in classical world only basic

4.6. Self hierarchy and the notion of magnetic body
237
frequency f = 15 Hz should have eﬀects (forcing ions to rotational motion around ﬁeld lines
with this frequency.
2. Even multiples of 15 Hz have a weak but non-vanishing eﬀect. This can be understood as result-
ing from parity conservation for the simplest transitions induced by that part of the interaction
Hamiltonian which does not depend on the longitudinal coordinate of the axon. The reason
is that odd and even values of n for harmonic oscillator states have opposite parities and the
interaction hamiltonian describing the transition has odd parity. The simplest possibility is that
these transitions occur in second via intermediate virtual intermediate state and correspond to
second order in perturbation theory. This observation provides additional strong support for
the hypothesis that quantum transitions are involved.
These observations are consistent with the following interpretation. Ions with charge Z, spin S
and mass m in the external magnetic ﬁeld behave quantum mechanically like harmonic oscillator with
energies quantized as multiples of
E

(n + 1

(4.6.1)
Here S and Sz denote total spin and its projection to the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld.
The
contribution to energy coming from longitudinal motion has not been written explicitly. Here g is so
called Lande factor which for free elementary fermions equals to g = 2. The experimental ﬁndings
suggests strongly that external em ﬁeld induces resonant transitions from between magnetic states.
By the quantization of the magnetic ﬂux, predicted by TGD also classically, the minimal size of the
magnetic ﬂux tube for the magnetic ﬁeld of Earth is of order cell size. An attractive hypothesis is
that the magnetic ﬁeld in question is associated with axon and is parallel to it.
It must be emphasized that this vision is forced by hard experimental facts and is in dramatic
contradiction with the standard physics view about brain. The wave functions of ions in magnetic
ﬁeld are conﬁned in a region of size of order
rn ∼
p
n/eB ,
which is of the order of cell size for B=.2 Gauss: macroscopic quantum state is in question. In fact,
the value .5 × 10−4 Tesla for Earth’s magnetic ﬁelds corresponds to the length scale L(169) ≃4
µm rather precisely for minimal value of the magnetic ﬂux quantized as ZeBS = n2π obtained for
n = 1 (S denotes the area of the ﬂux tube) and Z = 2e. L(169) seems to correspond to our sensory
consciousness and various macroscopic quantum phases seem to reside at k = 169 space-time sheets
probably forming join along boundaries condensates.
The binding energies of ions in Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld are extremely small: of order 10−14 eV, which
is ridiculously small energy when compared with the natural energy scale of one eV and corresponds to
a temperature of order 10−10 Kelvin. According to standard quantum physics, Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld
should have absolutely no detectable eﬀects in hot, wetty and noisy environment provided by brain.
Many-sheeted space-time concept provides the solution to the riddle. Ions are not on the molecular
space-time sheets but have dropped to the cellular space-time sheet and it is indeed very cold, dry
and silent here: an ideal place for the formation of macroscopic quantum phases. The energy scale
implies the upper bound T < 10−10 Kelvin for the temperature at cellular space-time sheets.
A further empirical input of crucial importance were the observations challenging the cherished
notions of ionic pumps and channels [I31] . These ﬁndings lead to a concrete view about biosystems
as three-levelled structures involving massless extremals (MEs), super conducting magnetic ﬂux tube
structures, and atomic space-time sheets containing the ordinary matter. MEs control the dynamics
of the superconducting ions inside magnetic ﬂux tube structures. Magnetic ﬂux tubes in turn are in
a many-sheeted ionic ﬂow equilibrium with the atomic space-time sheets and thus control the ionic
concentrations at these space-time sheets.

Chapter 4. Self and Binding
This general framework leads to a rather detailed model for the generation of nerve pulse and
EEG; to a model of sensory representations based on the notion of sensory canvas realized in terms
of magnetic ﬂux tube structures outside body with MEs serving as projectors of the cortical sensory
representations to this sensory canvas; to a model of cognition including the realization of the memetic
code in terms of cognitive antineutrinos and a physical mechanism translating nerve pulse sequencies
to the 126 bit long codewords of the memetic code; and ﬁnally, to a model for the quantum correlates
of the sensory qualia and to what deserves to be called spectroscopy of consciousness.
Electromagnetic selves
Rather remarkably, the time scale of .1 seconds predicted by the model of the memetic code and
deﬁning in the zero energy ontology a fundamental time scale of electron as well as the time scales of
the photons associated with the magnetic transition frequencies, in particular cyclotron frequencies,
of ions correspond to the time scale of EEG. The currents generating EEG certainly create weak
electromagnetic radiation ﬁelds which in TGD framework correspond to topological ﬁeld quanta of
size of Earth: the lowest Schumann frequency is roughly c/2πR, R radius of Earth, and equal to
ω ≃8 Hz. It is known that EEG frequencies are in the same frequency range as so called Schumann
frequencies 8, 14, 21 ,... Hz [F4] associated with the resonances of the electromagnetic ﬁelds in the 80
km thick wave cavity between Earth surface and ionosphere.
The higher EEG frequencies seem to correlate with higher Schumann resonance frequencies: in
particular,, the frequencies 13 and 39 Hz which are also cyclotron resonance frequencies of Na+, are
very near to Schumann frequencies. Schumann frequencies vary in time and it has been found that
also the variations of EEG frequencies correlate with this variation. Magnetic perturbations near
Schumann frequencies are known to have profound eﬀects on human brain inducing altered states of
consciousness and cortical instabilities such microseizures and epilepsies [J98]. The photons generated
by Josephson currents associated with macroscopic ionic BE condensates have wavelengths of order
Earth size and the topological ﬁeld quanta representing classically the radiation ﬁeld have size of
Earth.
These observations suggests the identiﬁcation of the relevant selves in our self-hierarchy are elec-
tromagnetic selves having the size of Earth and correspond to EEG frequencies. What happens is that
Josephson currents generate classical ELF em ﬁelds represented by topological ﬁeld quanta of this size
(by uncertainty principle alone) which in turn couple resonantly to ions. These observations raise
the question whether our ”physical” body is only a tip of an iceberg and formed by the topological
condensation of the biomatter around electromagnetic topological ﬁeld quanta serving as templates
for the biostructures [K12] . There is also neuropsycological evidence for the importance of ELF ﬁelds.
In particular, the work of Michael Persinger is especially important [J101, J99, J118] [K31] .
One possible scenario inspired by these observations is following.
1. The magnetic transition frequencies for the superconducting ions at the ﬂux quanta of magnetic
ﬁeld B=.2 Gauss correspond to personal sensory consciousness. The magnetic ﬂux tubes ema-
nating more or less vertically from brain and accompanied by massless extremals could act as
projectors deﬁning personal sensory representations at the magnetic sensory canvas formed by
the ﬂux tubes (or possibly shell like topological quanta) of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld.
2. Schumann frequencies associated with the oscillations of the ﬂux tubes of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld
would in turn correspond to transpersonal aspect of consciousness. Schumann resonances could
indeed induce a synchrony of the vertical magnetic ﬂux tube structures associated with separate
brains and even entangle them during sleep. This view is supported by some observations. In
hypnagogic states (states between wake and sleep) EEG is peaked near the lowest Schumann
frequency 7.8 Hz. During these states it is possible to experience hallucinations and identiﬁcation
experiences (I have now and then ﬂeeting but completely ’real’ experiences of being someone
else). The so called sleeping spindles correspond to EEG patterns at 14 Hz which is the second
Schumann frequency.
A possible interpretation is that during sleep collective consciousness
begins to dominate and brains form a highly synchronous whole. It would be interesting to test
whether there are correlations between EEGs of diﬀerent persons during sleep.

4.6.3
Some functions of magnetic body
The magnetic bodies associated with various body parts, including cellular and even molecular mag-
netic bodies, could have several functions besides deﬁning a hierarchy of intentional agents (for this
aspect see [K87] ).
Topologically quantized classical ﬁelds as templates for the formation of bio-structures?
Magnetic bodies could serve as templates of bio-structures. For instance, blood circulation and central
nervous system could have magnetic circuitries as templates.
The web like structure formed by
topological ﬁeld quanta representing classical ﬁelds, in particular em ﬁelds, is reminiscent of structures
formed by micro-tubuli and collagens forming the connective tissue of living systems. It has been
already earlier suggested that magnetic ﬂux tubes and other topological ﬁeld quanta serve as templates
for various bio-structures in the sense that ordinary matter is topologically condensed on the ﬂux tube
like structures. This would mean that living systems would be only part of much larger web formed
by Earth’s classical em ﬁeld forming one particular sub-self (mental image!) of Mother Gaia.
The thickness for the ﬂux tubes of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is about 2/
√
eB ≃4 × 10−6 meters.
There is direct evidence for the hypothesis that ions in a magnetic ﬁeld Bend = 2BE/5 = .2 Gauss,
where BE = .5 Gauss is the nominal value of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld, form quantum states with
the characteristic energies of order 10−14 eV and size of the orbit being of order 2/
√
eB, that is cell
size. It must be emphasized that Bend is not equal to BE as I erratically believed for a long time.
The model for dark matter as macroscopic quantum phases with Planck constant equal to an integer
multiple of the ordinary Planck constant [K24] leads to the working hypothesis that Bend corresponds
to the dark counterpart of BE [K21] .
For Bend = 2/5BE = .2 Gauss interpreted as a dark magnetic ﬁeld with ℏ= 5ℏ0 carrying 2 units
of ﬂux (the unit is h5 = 5h0) and corresponding also to the p-adic length scale L(169), the radius is
25 µm, the size of a large neuron. This possibly relates to the fact that the eﬀects of ELF em ﬁelds
are observed for vertebrates (for details see [K21] ).
The coupling of the neuronal layers of cortex and perhaps all cells with the ﬂux tubes of Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld could make possible entanglement between brain and Mother Gaia. If magnetic ﬂux
tubes of the dark counterpart of BE have direct geometric coupling with brain one could perhaps
understand the miraculous ability of birds and bees to navigate using Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. The
proteins navigating along micro-tubuli, cells navigating along collagen ﬁbres and birds navigating
along Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld lines would all be guided by higher level selves.
One could see also humans and the societies formed by them as continually self-organizing organs
in the body of electromagnetic Mother Gaia. In this picture the narrow wave cavity of radius 80 km
between Earth’s surface and ionosphere could be like brain of Earth, which is very sensitive to the
conditions of ionosphere and biosphere and has ”biofeedback” coupling with living systems. The eﬀect
of oscillatory phenomena (sound, radiations and magnetic ﬁelds) at frequencies Schumann resonances
on brain to be discussed below supports also the direct interaction of our brain with Mother Gaia via
Earth’s electromagnetic ﬁeld.
It is interesting to notice that the ratio of the thickness of solar corona (106 m) to the radius of
Sun (5×108 m), the height of the wave cavity of Earth (80 km) to Earth radius (7×106 m), the ratio
of the thickness of grey matter of cortex (1 mm )to the size of human brain lobe (10 cm) as well as
the the ratio of the thickness of the cell membrane (10−8 m) to the radius of neuron (2.5×10−6) have
roughly the same value of order 10−2. Could this mean that cell membrane, cortex, electromagnetic
cavity of Earth and solar corona might have similar role in the self hierarchy? The general ideas about
self-organization indeed support this view: boundary regions are subject to the most intense external
energy feed and thus self-organize most eﬀectively.
The web formed by topological ﬁeld quanta of the classical em and ﬁelds continues to arbitrary long
length scales. For instance, the ﬂux tube structure of solar magnetic ﬁeld provides an explanation for
the anomalously high temperature of solar corona and a model for solar spot cycle [K73] . Perhaps also
Sun is a conscious self forming part of ”Indra’s net” representing electromagnetic and other classical
ﬁelds of cosmos.
Since the four CP2 coordinates are the primary dynamical variables, one must
consider the possibility that topologically quantized classical gauge ﬁelds and classical gravitational
ﬁeld could form rather independent sub-selves.

Chapter 4. Self and Binding
Dark magnetic ﬁelds and living matter
A considerable sharpening of the above discussed speculative picture came with the development
of TGD inspired vision about dark matter as macroscopic quantum phases with quantized value of
Planck constant having arbitrarily large values coming as integer multiples of the ordinary Planck
constant [K24] .
Dark matter hierarchy leads to a detailed quantitative view about quantum biology with several
testable predictions [K21] .
1. The most general hypothesis is allowed by the proposed generalization of the notion of imbedding
space is that the values of r = ℏ/hbar0 come as rationals [K24] . A less general alternative is that
the values r of come as integers: r = n, where n characterizes the quantum phase q = exp(iπ/n)
characterizing Jones inclusion [K92] . In this case n would be a product of integers characterizing
the number of sheets for singular coverings of CD and CP2 .
2. The values of n for which quantum phase is expressible in terms of squared roots are number
theoretically preferred and correspond to integers n expressible as n = 2k Q
n Fsn, where Fs =
22s + 1 is Fermat prime and each of them can appear only once. The lowest Fermat primes are
F0 = 3, F1 = 5, F2 = 17.
The prediction is that also rational or at least integer multiples of p-adic length scales are possible
as preferred length scales. The unit of magnetic ﬂux scales up as h0 →h = rh0 in the transition scaling
the Planck constant by r: one manner to achieve this is by scalings L(k) →rL(k) and B →B/r.
B = .2 Gauss would corresponds to a ﬂux tube radius L =
p
5/2 × L(169) ≃1.58L(169), which
does not correspond to any p-adic length scale as such. k = 168 = 23 ×3×7 with n = 5 would predict
the ﬁeld strength correctly as Bend = 2BE/5 and predict the radius of the ﬂux tube to be r = 18 µm,
size of a large neuron. However, k = 169 with ﬂux 2h5 would be must more attractive option since it
would give a direct connection with Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Furthermore, the model for EEG forces to
assume that also a ﬁeld Bend/2 must be assumed and this gives the minimal ﬂux h5. Note that n = 5
is the minimal value of n making possible universal topological quantum computation with Beraha
number Bn = 4cos2(π/n) equal to Golden Mean [K90] .
An natural working hypothesis is that Bend deﬁnes the dark counterpart of the ordinary magneto-
sphere and that the relationship Bend = 2BE/5 holds as a time average in the entire magnetosphere.
The ﬂux quanta of Bend would carry dark matter and would be responsible for the quantum control
of the living matter.
Magnetic ﬂux tubes and metabolism
Magnetic ﬂux tubes could deﬁne super-conducting circuitry making possible a many-sheeted control
of homeostasis: this aspect is discussed in [K35] . The hierarchy of magnetic ﬂux tubes could also
deﬁne many-sheeted lasers, and the dropping of particles to the larger space-time sheets would deﬁne a
hierarchy of metabolic energy currencies as zero point kinetic energies liberated in the process. Process
would also generate radiation at the harmonics of cyclotron frequencies at the larger space-time sheet
. These frequencies could deﬁne a considerable part of EEG. Also fractally scaled up versions of EEG
having similar band structure are predicted. The ﬁndings of Peter [I16, I17] are consistent with this
prediction [K8] . The dropping of particles to larger space-time sheets for population inverted lasers
would be also ideal for the realization of bio-control by time mirror mechanism and make possible
remote metabolism and remote motor control.
Magnetic ﬂux tubes as Nature’s own bio-laboratory
Magnetic ﬂux tubes could be ideal structures for the isolation and puriﬁcation of various bio-molecules,
and make also possible precise targeting of the reactants to reaction volumes deﬁned by the nodes
of the magnetic ﬂux tube circuitry. Puriﬁcation is made possible by the weight of the molecule if
quantum-classical correspondence holds true in the sense that a magnetic ﬂux tube carrying super-
conducting bosons of mass m deforms so that it runs along a classical orbit of the particle with radius
proportional to m. This would make sense for a many-sheeted magnetic ﬁeld for which the ﬂuxes
associated with the magnetic ﬂux tubes along which particles move return along much larger space-
time sheets and deﬁne the average magnetic ﬁeld in which the particles move. This kind of Nature’s

4.6. Self hierarchy and the notion of magnetic body
241
own bio-laboratory might explain the miraculous selection of bio-molecules essential for the pre-biotic
evolution. In accordance with the p-adic vision about the evolution of cognition, the evolution would
have been proceeded from and guided by the magnetic ﬂux tube structures of the Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld to the bio-chemical level [K26] .
4.6.4
The magnetic ﬁelds associated with body parts and higher levels of
consciousness
The basic vision is that magnetic ﬂux tubes containing ionic super-conductors, MEs carrying exotic
representations of p-adic Super Virasoro algebra, and biological organisms live in a fractal symbiosis.
MEs can induce cyclotron transitions ampliﬁed to quantum phase transitions inside magnetic ﬂux
tubes provided they have length above the wavelength deﬁned by the cyclotron frequency. The exotic
p-adic Super Virasoro representations with MEs have wavelength determined by the fundamental
frequency which is of same order as the cyclotron frequency. The interaction of MEs and magnetic
ﬂux tubes by SQUID mechanism requires that magnetic ﬂux of ME generates a current inside a circuit
formed by magnetic ﬂux tubes. Magnetic ﬂux tubes to have arbitrary size scales below the size scale
of ME.
Some body parts are carriers of static magnetic ﬁelds.
The value of the static magnetic ﬁeld
associated with eye is slightly below 10−11 Tesla whereas the strength of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is
about .5 × 10−4 Tesla. Also pineal gland (’third eye’ also in a rather literal sense, see [K28] ) contains
magnetic material. Unfortunately I do know the value of the corresponding dipole strength: for a
dipole having size of order micrometer the maximal dipole strength would be very roughly 10−9 times
corresponding dipole strength for Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld which would mean ﬁeld of order 10−13 T.
Also head and entire body could act as static magnetic dipoles.
For purely sensory consciousness .1 seconds is the characteristic time scale and EEG is closely
related with this form of consciousness. In case of Be the magnetic cyclotron frequencies are in the
range obtained by scaling the range of cyclotron frequencies in Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld by a factor about
2 × 10−7. This means that the periods of the ionic cyclotron frequencies are roughly in the range 12
hours-1.6 years for ionic cyclotron frequencies corresponding to the range of frequencies 90−0.1 Hz in
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. These time scales are typical for the contents of higher level self consciousness
involving self narrative. Notice however that these ﬁelds are perhaps not suﬃciently weak for a self
narrative in the time scale of several years.
The minimal thickness of the ﬂux tubes for ULF selves associated with Be would be roughly of
the order of few millimeters, as one ﬁnds by scaling the radius for the ﬂux tube of Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld which is about 5 microns.
Also bodily magnetic ﬁelds Bb could be involved. By scaling one obtains for the head’s magnetic
ﬁeld an estimate (mm/headsize)2Be ∼10−4Be, which gives fT which is slightly above the thermal
noise produced by body. The ﬂux tube would have minimal thickness about 10 cm, the size scale of
the head. The cyclotron frequency range would be scaled by a further factor of 104 factor meaning
that the time scale range would be between 10 years and 104 years!
Higher levels of self hierarchy as levels of dark matter hierarchy
Higher levels of dark matter hierarchy provide neat quantitative view about self hierarchy and its
evolution. The integer n = 2k11, k = 0, 1, 2, ... seem to deﬁne favored values of Planck constant in
living matter. This means a hierarchy in which time and length scales are zoomed up by a factor of
2048 in the transition to the next level of hierarchy. This integer represents also fundamental constant
in TGD Universe [K73] .
For instance, EEG time scales corresponds to k = 4 level of hierarchy and a time scale of .1
seconds [K20] , and EEG frequencies correspond at this level dark photon energies above the thermal
threshold so that thermal noise is not a problem anymore. Various levels of dark matter hierarchy
would naturally correspond to higher levels in hierarchy of consciousness and the typical duration of
life cycle would give an idea about the level in questions. k = 7 would correspond to a duration of
moment of conscious of order human lifetime which suggests that k = 7 corresponds to the highest
dark matter level relevant to our consciousness whereas higher levels would in general correspond to
transpersonal consciousness. k = 5 would correspond to time scale of short term memories measured
in minutes and k = 6 to a time scale of memories measured in days.

242
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
The emergence of these levels must have meant evolutionary leap since long term memory is also
accompanied by ability to anticipate future in the same time scale. This picture would suggest that
the basic diﬀerence between us and our cousins is not at the level of genome as it is usually understood
but at the level of the hierarchy of magnetic bodies [K40, K21] . In fact, higher levels of dark matter
hierarchy motivate the introduction of the notions of super-genome and hyper-genome. The genomes
of entire organ can join to form super-genome expressing genes coherently. Hyper-genomes would
result from the fusion of genomes of diﬀerent organisms and collective levels of consciousness would
express themselves via hyper-genome and make possible social rules and moral.
Could the ﬂux tubes of bodily magnetic ﬁelds correlate with more abstract levels of self
consciousness?
The previous observations combined with the general speculative vision about Indra’s web of conscious-
ness stimulate several questions and ideas relating to the role of various magnetic ﬁelds associated
with body.
1. Could it be that the ULF selves associated with the ionic super-conductors residing at the
ﬂux tubes of the bodily magnetic ﬁelds Be and Bb (notice also the static magnetic ﬁelds of
pineal gland and of other organs) belong to the self hierarchy and represent higher level selves
contributing to our non-sensory consciousness under ordinary circumstances? This translates to
the question whether the ﬂux tubes of the corresponding topological quantized magnetic ﬁelds
are closed in a relatively small volume as in case of an ideal dipole ﬁeld or whether part of ﬂux
tubes have astrophysical lengths.
2. The above arguments do not pose restrictions on the strengths of the magnetic ﬁelds. In case of
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld the magnetic ﬂux tubes have sizes of order of the wavelength associated
with a typical cyclotron frequency. Could it be that the interacting MEs and magnetic ﬂux
tubes have sizes comparable to the wavelength deﬁned by cyclotron frequency? If this is the
case for Be and Bb, the sizes of ﬂux tubes would be astronomical with light day serving as lower
bound. One could see the ﬂux tubes of Be and Bb as kind of umbilical cords connecting human
bodies with magnetic structures of astronomical size and perhaps also with other organisms.
Could one assign the more abstract levels of human consciousness and long term memories with
the ULF selves associated with both the ﬂux tubes of Be and Bb and with MEs? In this view
biological organisms would be like sensory-motor organs of this magnetic super organism.
3. Could one possibly test this hypothesis in case of Be by studying the interaction of ULF em ﬁelds
with frequencies above the time scale deﬁned by day? Is the daily rhythm somehow relevant at
the level of these em ﬁelds? For instance, could the natural 24 hour period certainly associated
with ULF em ﬁelds of eye deﬁne the analog of alpha peak in EEG? Could the strength of the
magnetic ﬁelds of eye be seen as a result of adaptation to the daily rhythm or is it dictated by
the size of eye and ﬂux quantization (there is roughly unit ﬂux over an area of order millimeter
squared)?
Objection
The bodily magnetic ﬁeld change with time if the location orientation of the magnetic dipoles are
ﬁxed with body. Already the rotation of Earth induces periodic rotation of the magnetic ﬂux tubes
Be and Bb. The volitional motion during wake-up period induces further eﬀects.
There are several manners to circumvent this objection.
1. The most convincing manner to avoid the objection is that the ﬂux tubes relevant for ULF
consciousness have size at least of order of the wavelength deﬁned by the cyclotron frequency
and thus of the same order of magnitude as the size of the corresponding MEs. In this scale
the rotating motion for the end of the magnetic ﬂux tube of Be or Bb would have absolutely no
signiﬁcance and magnetic ﬂux tubes would be somewhat like magnetic umbilic cords (like the
tunnel involved with the NDE experiences connecting patient to the deceased relatives!).
2. If the magnetic ﬂux tubes in question have sizes comparable or smaller than Earth size, the
situation changes. Only in the very special case that the ﬂux tubes rotate around Earth in the

4.6. Self hierarchy and the notion of magnetic body
243
direction of equator, Be and Bb could remain stationary and it makes sense to speak about
stationary states.
3. One could also consider the possibility that magnetic ﬂux quanta are layer like structures around
Earth rather than rotating tubular structures, and have rotational symmetry with respect to the
rotations around Earth axis so that it is body which is rotating with respect to these structures
rather that these structures rotating with body. In this case it would make sense to assign
cyclotron frequencies to the super-conducting ions in question since local magnetic states are
certainly possible. In super-conductors of type I near critical temperature complicated layer like
ﬂux structures are indeed possible and in [K10, K11] it has been suggested that epithelial sheets
formed by cell membrane inside cells correspond to this kind of ﬂux structures.
The obvious question is how the rotation of Earth aﬀects localized stationary states of the super-
conducting ions inside co-rotating magnetic ﬂux tubes with sizes smaller than Earth size. Does the
description of the system in terms of cyclotron states make sense anymore? Quantum mechanically the
ion in a stationary magnetic magnetic ﬁeld is in radial degrees of freedom like a harmonic oscillator.
1. A simple analog system would be a harmonic oscillator rotating with an Earth and having an
oscillation period which is longer than 12 hours. By separating center of mass degrees of freedom
one ﬁnds that the particle in the rotating oscillator well feels besides the ordinary harmonic force
a harmonic force mω2rcm which means that the complete solution to the equations of motion
is superposition of the harmonic oscillator motion plus a periodic oscillatory term with the
frequency of the external force. The average motion is therefore just the rotating harmonic
oscillator motion.
2. In quantum case one has harmonic oscillator coupled to an external harmonic force having a
frequency much larger than the oscillator frequency. Time dependent perturbation theory allows
transitions only between the states whose energy diﬀerence nω0 equals to the forcing frequency
and transitions thus possible only if one has ω = nω0. Thus no quantum jumps would occur in
the generic case.
3. The guess motivated by these considerations is that the magnetic state in a rotating magnetic
ﬁeld is in a good approximation obtained by applying time dependent rotation to the ordinary
magnetic state and that in the time scale deﬁned by the cyclotron frequency the average eﬀects
to the state cancel also now. Thus eﬀective adiabaticity holds true.
Further questions related to vision
One can make several interesting questions related to vision and the magnetic ﬁelds of eye.
1. What is the role of the rapid eye movements during REM sleep, in particular during dreams?
Could it be that the communication of long term memories from ULF level is involved with
dreams and that the rhythmic eye movements are essential for establishing this communication?
2. The motor control associated with eyes is decoupled from the motor control of the remaining
body.
Therefore persons who are totally paralyzed can still move their eyes and can even
communicate in this manner. Could the special role of the eye-motorics relate to the remaining
ability to stay in contact with ULF selves associated with eyes?
3. What is the interpretation of the rays of light characterizing the visual perception of intense
light. Perhaps there is some natural explanation for this but since I do not know about it, I can
entertain myself with the idea that these rays could directly correspond to MEs representing
rays of light and connecting me with the objects of the external world. The correspondence
between sensory experience and reality would be amazingly simple, if this is true.
NDE experiences and magnetic consciousness
NDE experiences [J36, J90] involve vision in an essential manner. This suggests that the dominating
component of NDE consciousness could correspond to ULF selves associated with Be and or Bb and
give rise to the typical bird’s eye of view about own body involved with the OBE and NDE experiences.

244
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
The cyclotron frequency time scale associated with Bb would indeed ﬁt with the life review experienced
in NDE experiences. Body would be seen by ULF selves in bird’s eye of view through the magnetic ﬂux
tubes of Be and Bb. There would be a strange resiprocity resembling to the resiprocity encountered
in the techniques of radio communications where the antennae sending messages can also serve as
receiving antennae. NDE experiences involve also meeting of the dead relatives. Magnetic ﬂux tubes
can connect patient also to other organisms. and it would not be too surprising if magnetic ﬂux tubes
starting from the body could serve as an umbilic cord connecting the patient with living relatives or
magnetic structures representing deceased relatives.
NDE experiences involve also the experience of travelling through a tunnel. The tunnel is expe-
rienced also during epilepsy and migraine, during meditation and relaxed state of mind, and with
certain drugs like LSD, philocybin and mescaline.
I have also personal ’tunnel experiences’ every-daily: when I close my eyes in a half-meditative
state achieved by writing at computer terminal, I can see a dim ﬂow consisting of points. Typically
this ﬂow enters to or emergences from a tunnel. It can be rotating spiral like ﬂow or simple sink or
source. Source or sink can be also linear structure. The experience is not stable and tends to fade away
all the time, and after few minutes I am not anymore able to achieve it. During my great experiences
this ﬂow was much more complicated and completely visible and formed a stable background of the
ordinary visual experience and of hallucinatory visual images.
There is however no experience of entering into the tunnel in this case so that the tunnel need
not be the same as encountered in NDEs. I have pondered quite a many times about the possible
interpretation of this background ﬂow. The basic observation was that it resembles liquid ﬂow to
a very high extent. Liquid ﬂows are usually incompressible in an excellent approximation and this
means that the velocity ﬁeld is divergence free. This is the basic property of also magnetic ﬁelds and
means that magnetic ﬂux through a circuit moving along magnetic ﬂux lines is conserved. This has
stimulated the obvious guess that the background ﬂow indeed represents magnetic ﬁeld. The question
which I have not made is whether this magnetic ﬁeld resides inside my brain or outside it. In light of
the above considerations the most natural answer to the question is that the magnetic ﬁeld visualized
by the ﬂow is precisely where it seems to be. The ﬂow would represent nothing but the magnetic ﬁeld
associated with my own eyes or more probably head, or rather how the self associated with the ﬂux
tubes of this magnetic ﬁeld experiences the world.
The thickness of the ﬂux tubes of Bb would be roughly the size of the head and this ﬁts with idea
that the tunnel experience represents directly the magnetic ﬂow without any scaling factors involved.
The fractality of TGD Universe suggests that these magnetic ﬁelds contain ﬂux tubes of stronger
magnetic ﬁelds inside them, so that the tunnel experience would represent the ﬂux tubes of these
magnetic ﬁelds experienced as sub-selves by the ULF self contributing to my visual consciousness
in this altered state of consciousness.
Of course, it might well be that also during the ordinary
consciousness the experiencer is this magnetic ULF self and that sensory input dominates the content
of the conscious experience and creates the illusion about body as self. In the absence of a sensory
input the contents of consciousness of a clinically dead person is determined by these magnetic ﬁeld
and bird’s eye of view about body results.
What remains after the physical death could therefore be determined by the magnetic ﬁelds in-
volved with body. Magnetic ﬂux conservation allows conﬁgurations of the closed magnetic ﬂux loops
containing ionic super-conductors as the counterpart of soul continuing existence after death. Worm-
hole magnetic ﬁelds and p-adic variants of these magnetic ﬁelds would also make it possible to store
information about the magnetic ﬁelds originally associated with body. The overall view suggesting
itself that our bodies are like sensors and motor organs of a gigantic electromagnetic organisms of
astrophysical size and represent its sub-selves (mental images). This interpretation conforms with
the fact that in EMDR method rhythmic eye movements induce experiences involving the meeting of
deceased relatives [J40] .
The experimental study of what happens to the magnetic ﬁelds associated with eyes, head and
other body parts after the physical death would obviously provide interesting information in this
respect, perhaps one can someday even develop reﬁned methods of communication with the deceased.
What about magnetic ﬁelds of heart?
The magnetic ﬁelds associated with eyes are not the only bodily magnetic ﬁelds with peak intensities
higher than the non-static magnetic ﬁelds generated by brain. Heart generates a periodically oscillating

4.7. Updates since 2012
245
magnetic ﬁeld Bh of order .5 × 10−10 Tesla which is almost ten times higher than the static magnetic
ﬁeld generated by eyes. I do not know whether Bh contains a static component and if so, what is its
strength. In any case, the absence of the static component means that the possibly super-conducting
ions inside ﬂux tubes of heart’s magnetic ﬁeld are in a periodically oscillating dipole ﬁeld (most
probably with respect to the geometric time!).
Also here my ’great experience’, which has turned out to be an extremely valuable repertoire of
altered states of consciousness, provides an illustrative example. During the second great experience
which lasted only one night, I experienced what might be called ’heart consciousness’. In the beginning
of the experience my whole consciousness was ﬁlled by the rhythmic ’..aqua-aqua-aqua..’. It took
some time to recognize that this rhythm was the rhythm of my own heart. Involved was also the
mystical experience about the fundamental importance of water for life (said jokingly, heart is an
organ specialized to deal with liquid!) and the precognition of the notion of inﬁnite primes. Could
it be that the MEs associated with heart dominated the contents of my consciousness during this
experience.
4.7
Updates since 2012
A considerable progress has occurred in the understanding of TGD inspired theory of consciousness
during the ﬁrst half of 2013.
I have not however included separate sections about this progress
since other chapters of ”TGD Inspired theory of consciousness” already contain the relevant material.
A detailed representation of the recent vision about TGD inspired theory of consciousness [K97] is
recommended for the reader interested in details and various philosophical problems and their solutions
in TGD framework.
The original vision was that quantum jumps somehow integrate to form self but I was not able to
formulate this idea in a convincing manner. The fractal hierarchy of quantum jumps then inspired the
equally fuzzy idea that the quantum jump could be identiﬁed as self at given level of hierarchy. It has
however turned out that this somewhat artiﬁcial interpretation is not necessary. Following Buddha,
one can replace self with self representation deﬁned as something approximately invariant in quantum
jump sequence. NMP [K44] indeed implies that negentropic entanglement is approximately invariant
under quantum jumps. This allows to build a direct connection with the basic idea of quantum biology
about the braiding of magnetic ﬂux tubes as a correlate for the negentropic entanglement and identify
braidings as kind of ”Akashic records”.
The updated view about the realisation of memory representations is discussed at the end of the
chapter ”Quantum Model of Memory” [K66]. The basic assumption is that K¨ahler magnetic ﬂux tubes
carrying monopole ﬂux and topological light rays (”massless externals” (MEs)) parallel to them serve
as geometric correlates of quantum coherence and their braiding serves as correlate for negentropic
entanglement. This leads to a rather concrete picture about how various representations are realised
at the level of the magnetic body of the organism.
In the following subsections only the aspects most relevant to the notion of self are discussed.
4.7.1
The anatomy of quantum jump in zero energy ontology (ZEO)
Zero energy ontology emerged around 2005 and has had profound consequences for the understand-
ing of quantum TGD. The basic implication is that state function reductions occur at the opposite
light-like boundaries of causal diamonds (CDs) forming a hierarchy, and produce zero energy states
with opposite arrows of imbedding space time. Also concerning the identiﬁcation of quantum jump
as moment of consciousness ZEO encourages rather far reaching conclusions. In ZEO the only dif-
ference between motor action and sensory representations on one hand, and intention and cognitive
representation on the other hand , is that the arrows of imbedding space time are opposite for them.
Furthermore, sensory perception followed by motor action corresponds to a basic structure in the
sequence of state function reductions and it seems that these processes occur fractally for CDs of
various size scales.
1. State function reduction can be performed to either boundary of CD but not both simultaneously.
State function reduction at either boundary is equivalent to state preparation giving rise to a
state with well deﬁned quantum numbers (particle numbers, charges, four-momentum, etc...)
at this boundary of CD. At the other boundary single particle quantum numbers are not well

246
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
deﬁned although total conserved quantum numbers at boundaries are opposite by the zero energy
property for every pair of positive and negative energy states in the superposition. State pairs
with diﬀerent total energy, fermion number, etc.. for other boundary are possible: for instance,
t coherent states of super-conductor for which fermion number is ill deﬁned are possible in zero
energy ontology and do not break the super-selection rules.
2. The basic objects coding for physics are U-matrix, M-matrices and S-matrix. M-matrices corre-
spond to a orthogonal rows of unitary U-matrix between zero energy states, and are expressible
as products of a hermitian square root of density matrix and of unitary S-matrix which more or
less corresponds to ordinary S-matrix. One can say that quantum theory is formally a square
root of thermodynamics. The thermodynamics in question would however relate more naturally
to NMP rather than second law, which at ensemble level and for ordinary entanglement can be
seen as a consequence of NMP.
The non-triviality of M-matrix requires that for given state reduced at say the ”lower” boundary
of CD there is entire distribution of statesat ”upper boundary” (given initial state can lead to
a continuum of ﬁnal states). Even more, all size scales of CDs are possible since the position of
only the ”lower” boundary of CD is localized in quantum jump whereas the location of upper
boundary of CD can vary so that one has distribution over CDs with diﬀerent size scales and
over their Lorentz boots and translates.
3. The quantum arrow of time follows from the asymmetry between positive and negative energy
parts of the state: the other is prepared and the other corresponds to the superposition of the
ﬁnal states resulting when interactions are turned on. What is remarkable that the arrow of
time at imbedding space level at least changes direction when quantum jump occurs to opposite
boundary.
This brings strongly in mind the old proposal of Fantappie [J62] that in living matter the arrow
of time is not ﬁxed and that entropy and its diametric opposite syntropy apply to the two
arrows of the imbedding space time. The arrow of subjective time assignable to second law
would hold true but the increase of syntropy would be basically a reﬂection of second law since
only the arrow of the geometric time at imbedding space level has changed sign. The arrow
of geometric at space-time level which conscious observer experiences directly could be always
the same if quantum classical correspondence holds true in the sense that the arrow of time for
zero energy states corresponds to arrow of time for preferred extremals. The failure of strict
non-determinism making possible phenomena analogous to multifurcations makes this possible.
4. This picture diﬀers radically from the standard view and if quantum jump represents a funda-
mental algorith, this variation of the arrow of geometric time from quantum jump to quantum
jump should manifest itself in the functioning of brain and living organisms. The basic building
brick in the functioning of brain is the formation of sensory representation followed by motor
action. These processes look very much like temporal mirror images of each other such as the
state function reductions to opposite boundaries of CD look like. The fundamental process could
correspond to a sequences of these two kinds of state function reductions for opposite bound-
aries of CDs and maybe independently for CDs of diﬀerent size scales in a ”many-particle” state
deﬁned by a union of CDs.
How the formation of cognitive and sensory representations could relate to quantum jump?
1. ZEO allows quantum jumps between diﬀerent number ﬁelds so that p-adic cognitive represen-
tations can be formed and intentional actions realized. How these quantum jumps are realized
at the level of generalized Feynman diagrams is non-trivial question: one possibility suggested
by the notion of adele combining reals and various p-adic number ﬁelds to a larger structure is
that the lines and vertices of generalized Feynman diagrams can correspond to diﬀerent number
ﬁelds [K94].
The formation of cognitive representation could correspond to a quantum jump in which real
space-time sheet identiﬁed as a preferred extremal is mapped to its p-adic counterpart or su-
perposition of them with the property that the discretized versions of all p-adic counterparts
are identical. In the latter case the chart map of real preferred extremal would be quantal and

4.7. Updates since 2012
247
correspond to delocalized state in WCW. The p-adic chart mappings are not expected to take
place but with some probabilities determined by the number theoretically universal U-matrix.
2. Similar consideration applies to intentional actions realized as real chart maps for p-adically
realized intention. The natural interpretation of the process is as a time reversal of cognitive
map. Cognitive map would be generated from real sensory represention and intentional action
would transform time reversed cognitive map to real ”motor” action identiﬁable as time reversal
of sensory perception. This would occur in various length scales in fractal manner.
3. The formation of superpositions of preferred extremals associated with discrete p-adic chart
maps from real preferred extremals could be interpretated as an abstraction process. Similar
abstraction could take place also in the mapping of p-adic space-time surface to a superposition of
real preferred extrmals representing intentional action. U-matrix should give also the probability
amplitudes for these processes, and the intuitive idea is that the larger then number of common
rational and algebraic points of real and p-adic surfaces is, the higher the probability for this is:
the ﬁrst guess is that the amplitude is proportional the number of common points. On the other
hand, large number of common points means high measurement resolution so that the number
of diﬀerent surfaces in superposition tends to be smaller.
4. One should not make any un-necessary assumptions about the order of various kinds of quantum
jumps. For the most general option real-to-padic and p-adic-to-real quantum jumps can follow
any quantum jumps and state function reductions to opposite boundaries of CD can also occur
any time in any length scale. Also the length scale of resolution scale assignable to the cognitive
representation should be determined probabilistically. Quantal probabilities for quantum jumps
should therefore apply to all aspect of quantum jump and now ad hoc assumptions should
be made. Very probably internal consistency allows only very few alternative scenarios. The
assumption that the cascade beginning from given CD continues downwards until stops due to
the emergence of negentropic entanglement looks rather natural constraint.
4.7.2
Self or only a model of self?
Negentropic entanglement provides a model for associations as rules in which superposition of tensor
product states deﬁnes rule with entanglement pairs deﬁning its various instances. This generalizes to
N-fold tensor products. Associations would be realized as N-neuron negentropic entanglement stable
against NMP. One could also think of realizing associative areas in terms of neurons, whose inputs form
entangled tensor product and when sensory inputs are received they form analogous tensor product
in representative degrees of freedom.
Thus negentropic entanglement is necessary for mental images (having sub-CDs as correlates) to
mental images representing spatial patterns. Negentropic entanglement in time direction for these
patterns (zero energy states) is in turn necessary to bind them to sequences of mental images repre-
senting abstract memories as sequences of mental images. Negentropically entangled sequence would
be a quantal counterpart for the original association sequence introduced as purely geometric concept.
This picture however challenges the identiﬁcation of self as quantum jump. Should the negentropi-
cally entangled sequences of mental images deﬁne selves so that self would be something characterizing
zero energy state rather than something identiﬁed as quantum jump? Could they deﬁne a model of
self to be distinguished from self identiﬁed as quantum jump? Or could one give up the notion of
self alltogether and be satisﬁed with model of self? At this moment it seems that nothing is lost by
assuming only the model of self.
By deﬁnition negentropic entanglement tends to be preserved in quantum jumps so that it repre-
sents information as approximate invariant: this conforms with the idea of invariant representation
and quite generally with the idea that invariants represent the useful information. There is however a
problem involved. This information would not be conscious if the original view about conscious infor-
mation as a change of information is accepted. Could one imagine a reading mechanism in which this
information is read without changing the negentropically entangled state at all? This reading process
would be analogous to deducing the state of a two-state system in interaction free measurement to be
discussed below in more detail.
If the notion of interaction free measurement makes sense also in TGD based quantum measure-
ment theory, the models of self and external world can be deﬁned in terms of representations (sensory -

248
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
, memory - , cognitive -) and their time reversals and correspond to the reﬂective level of consciousness
as opposed to the phenomenal consciousness to which sensory qualia contribute mostly. Self repre-
sentations are not exact invariants although there seems to be no end for experience of consciousness:
sleep in this framework can be interpreted as a period about which there are no memories accessi-
ble in wake-up state. If the contribution of the magnetic body dominates during sleep, this can be
understood.
4.7.3
How memories are represented and recalled?
Formation of memories and memory recall are key elements in the vision proposed by Hawkins. The
question is what memories and memory recall are. If quantum jump is the fundamental process, it
should automatically give rise to memories and memory recall.
1. Memories in given scale would naturally correspond to sequences of mental images deﬁned
by negentropically entangled sub-CDs of CD in given scale.
According to earlier view the
sequences of moments of consciousness bind to form higher level moments of consciousness,
selves.
Somewhat diﬀerent view is that formation of selves means formation of sequence of
negentropically entangled sub-CDs stable against NMP and preserved in quantum jump and
even increasing in size. Thus self would correspond to a property of state and consciousness
would be associated with the replacement of state with a new one.
2. The hierarchical structure of memories would emerge naturally. Conscious memory recall would
correspond to a generation of negentropic entanglement between the new mental images emerg-
ing in the state function reduction (recall that the sizes of CDs increase and new sub-CDs
emerge) and already existing negentropically entangled mental images. Generation of negen-
tropic entanglement would give rise to the experience of recognition of the new mental images.
3. The natural guess is that negentropic entanglement is generated if the new sensory input is
”consistent” with older mental images. The addition of new tensor factor would mean a more
abstract representation so that the sequence of quantum jumps would mean accumulation of
experience. Consistency with older mental images could mean that the mental images have same
”name”. The name could correspond to p-adic cognitive representation. The physical correlate
could be a collection of resonance frequencies. The names would be same if the frequencies for
older mental images and new one are same, so that resonant interactions becomes possible. The
generation of negentropic entanglement would be like ﬁnding a radio station.
For this proposal memory recall and memory formation are actually more or less the same thing.
Only the completely new memories claimed to be formed in hippocampus would not involve memory
recall. The new memory would correspond to a new sub-CD or ensemble of sub-CDs representing
the associated negentropically entangled mental images. Neuronal loop could make possible to build
copies about the new memory and thinking about it would create copies of corresponding p-adic cog-
nitive representations which in turn could be transformed via state function reduction to an opposite
boundary of CD to actions. In TGD framework the 4-D hierarchy of memories could continue from
hippocampus to the magnetic body: this would explain the correlation of EEG with memory and also
with various other brain functions.
4.7.4
Could interaction free measurement be used to deduce information
about self model?
The assumption that self model is a negentropically entangled system which does not change in
state function reduction, leads to a problem. If the conscious information about this kind of subself
corresponds to change of negentropy in quantum jump, it seems impossible to get this information.
Quite generally, if moment of consciousness corresponds to quantum jump and thus change, how it
is possible to carry conscious information about quantum state?
The following proposal for non-
destructive reading of memories and future plans allows to resolve this problem.

4.7. Updates since 2012

Bomb testing problem as a model for interaction free measurement
One can consider a generalization of so called interaction free measurement as a manner to deduced
information about self model. This information would be obtained as sequences of bits and might be
correspond to declarative, verbal memories rather than direct sensory experiences.
1. The bomb testing problem of Elitzur and Vaidman gives a nice concrete description of what hap-
pens in interaction free measurement, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElitzurVaidman_
bomb-testing_problem [B1] for an illustration of the system considered.
The challenge is to ﬁnd whether the bomb is dud or not. Bomb explodes if it receives photon
with given energy. The simplest test would explode all bombs. Interaction free measurement
allows to make test by destroying only small number of bombs and at idealized limit no bombs
are destroyed.
The system involves four lenses arranged in square and two detectors C and D at the upper
right corner of the square. In the ﬁrst lense at the lower left corner the incoming photon beam
splits to reﬂected and transmitted beams: the path travelled by transmitted beam contains the
bomb.
(a) The bomb absorbs photon with a probability which tells the fraction of photon beam going
to the path at which bomb is (is transmitted through the lense). The other possibility is
that this measurement process creates a state in which photon travels along the other path
(is reﬂected). This photon goes through a lense and ends up to detector C or D through
lense.
(b) If the bomb is dud, the photon travels through both paths and interference at the lense
leads the photon to detector D. If C detects photon we know that the bomb was not a dud
without exploding it. If D detects the photon, it was either dud or not and we can repeat
the experiment as long as bomb explodes, or C detects photon and stop if the detector
continues to be D (dud). This arrangement can be reﬁned so that at the ideal limit no
explosions take place and all.
2. The measurement of bomb property is interaction free experiment in the sense that state function
reduction performed by absorber/bomb can eliminate the interaction in the sense that photon
travels along the path not containing the bomb. One might say that state function reduction
is an interaction which can eliminates the usual interaction with photon beam. State function
reduction performed by bomb can change the history of photon so it travels along the path not
containing the bomb.
This picture is only metaphorical representation of something much more general.
1. Bomb could be of course replaced with any two-state system absorbing photons in one state but
not in the other state, say atom. Now one would test in which state the atom is gaining one
bit of information in the optimal situation. Two-state atom could thus represent bit and one
could in principle read the bit sequence formed by atoms (say in row) by this method without
any photon absorption so that the row of atoms would remain in the original state.
2. Two-state system could be replaced with N-state system. In this case the testing selects at ﬁrst
step one state as analogs of bomb intact and the remaining states as analogs of dud. If the
answer was ”dud” in the ﬁrst step, the next step selects one preferred state from N −1 states
and regards the remaining states as ”dud”. The process continues until the state of the system
is measured.
3. In TGD framework the photon paths branching at lenses correspond to branching 3-surfaces
analogous to branching strings in string model and photon wave splits to sum of waves travelling
along the two paths.

250
Chapter 4. Self and Binding
Memory recall as an interaction free measurement
One can imagine several applications if the information to be read in interaction free manner can be
interpreted as bit sequences represented as states of two-state system. Lasers in ground states and its
excited state would be analogous many particle quantum system. In TGD framework the analog of
laser consisting of two space-time sheets with diﬀerent sizes and diﬀerent zero point kinetic energies
would be the analogous system.
For instance, a model of memory recall with memories realized as negentropically entangled states
such that each state represents a qubit can be considered. The model applies also to the reading of
future plans (memories on reversed time direction) and other representations.
1. Reading of a particular qubit of memory means sending of negative energy photon signal to the
past, which can be absorbed in the reading process. The problem is however that the memory
representation is changed in this process since two state system returns to the ground state. This
could be seen as analog of no-cloning theorem (the read thoughts deﬁne the clone). Interaction
free measurement could help to overcome the problem partially. Memory would not be aﬀected
at all at the limit so that no-cloning theorem would be circumvented at this limit.
2. A possible problem is that the analogs of detectors C and D for a given qubit are in geometric
past and one must be able to decide whether it was C or D that absorbed the negative energy
photon! Direct conscious experience should tell whether the detector C or D ﬁred: could this
experience correspond to visual quale black/white and more generally to a pair of complementary
colors?
3. ZEO means that zero energy states appear have both imbedding space arrows of time and these
arrows appear alternately. This dichotomy would correspond to sensory representation-motor
action dichotomy and would suggest that there is no fundamental diﬀerence between memory
recall and future prediction by self model and they diﬀerent only the direction of the signal.
4. Since photon absorption is the basic process, the conscious experience about the qubit pattern
could be visual sensation or even some other kind of sensory qualia induced by the absoroption
of photons. The model for the lipids of cell membrane as pixels of a sensory screen suggests that
neuronal/cell membranes could serve deﬁned digital self model at the length scale of neurons.
The concrete model for the reading of the representations in terms of dark photons and possibly also
dark phonons discussed in [K97] lead also to a proposal that bio-photons (- phonons) are identiﬁable
as the decay products of dark photons (- phonons).

Introduction
This - as also the other chapters of ”TGD Inspired Theory of Consciousness”- was written for the
ﬁrst time for more than a decade ago. The recent version is an outcome of an updating motivated by
the progress taken place in quantum TGD proper during the period 2005-2010. Several new elements
are involved. The improved understanding of the quantum TGD itself at the fundamental level; zero
energy ontology including the notion of causal diamond (CD) deﬁned as the intersection of future and
past directed lightcones; the hierarchy of Planck constants requiring a generalization of the notion of
imbedding space and involving the identiﬁcation of dark matter as phases with non-standard values
of Planck constant; and the progress in the undersanding of p-adic physics- especially the realization
that life could be seen as something residing in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. The fact
that number theoretic entanglement negentropy has a positive value in the intersection has profound
implications for the TGD inspired theory of consciousness and quantum biology since the quantum
measurement theory is modiﬁed profoundly.
5.1.1
Overall view about TGD inspired theory of consciousness
TGD inspired theory of consciousness allows to construct a general model of conscious experiences
based on some very general principles.
1. The original view was that notion of quantum jump deﬁnes ”microscopic” theory of consciousness
whereas the notions of self and self hierarchy allow to understand ”macroscopic” aspects of
consciousness absolutely essential for brain consciousness. It however seems that zero energy
ontology and the hierarchy of Planck constants allow to identify these notions by replacing the
quantum jump as a fractal structure consisting of quantum jumps within quantum jups. Despite
this I will prefer to talk about these notions as separate ones in the sequel. The assumptions
about how the contents of consciousness of self is determined allow to understand the basic
structure of conscious experience at general level. One can understand intentionality and volition
as closely related to the p-adic nondeterminism. Negentropic quantum entanglement is stable
under state function reduction if governed by Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) so
that state function reduction is not a random process anymore. The implications are obvious
for understanding how conscious intelligence emerges. Theory leads to a very general model of
sensory experience -including a vision about qualia- and the so called whole-body consciousness
involving in an essential manner negentropic entanglement explains the basic characteristics of
altered states of conscousness.
2. The understanding of the relationship between subjective and geometric time has evolved via
several proposals and leads to the notion of psychological time involving in an an essential
manner the new view about space-time. Symbolic representations at space-time level required
by quantum classical correspondence are made possible by the classical nondeterminism of K¨ahler
251

252
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
action. All space-time sheet are assigned to CDs in zero energy ontology and correspond to mind-
like space-time sheets in the earlier terminology. They serve as geometric correlate of selves.
The notion of psychological time forces to view the entire many-sheeted space-time surface as
a living system so that the standard notion of linear time is illusory and reﬂects the restricted
information content of our conscious experience rather than fundamental 4-dimensional reality.
The paradigm of 4-dimensional brain provides a completely new understanding of the long term
memory: no memory storage mechanisms are needed and one avoids the basic diﬃculties of
neural net models. There are two kinds of memories: subjective and geometric. Also geometric
memories come in two types: episodal and declarative.
Time-like negentropic entanglement
make possible episodal memories as a direct re-experiencing in the intersection of real and
p-adic worlds, and state function reduction trivializing time-like entropic entanglement gives
rise to declarative, verbal memories mediated by classical communications. Massless extremals
(MEs) are proposed to serve as space-time correlates for both kinds of memories. The fact that
the temporal duration of the light-like self associated with ME can be arbitrarily long, is very
probably of signiﬁcance. The hierarchy of Planck constants allows to overcome the objection due
to the fact that the photons with the required extremely low frequencies are below the thermal
threshold in living matter and therefore should not have any role for consciousness. Emotions
might be understood as resulting from the comparison of geometric memories (the expectation)
with the subjective memories (what really happened). The positive-negative coloring of the
emotions could relate directly to whether the mental images corresponds to a system with
negentropic or entropic entanglement.
3. An essential element is macrotemporal quantum coherence accompanying the formation of bound
and negentropically entangled states. Already zero energy ontology assigns macroscopic time
scales of coherence to elementary particles and the hierarchy of Planck constants and the stabil-
ity of negentropic entanglement against state function reduction bring in additional elements.
Quantum spin glass degeneracy lengthens the lifetimes of the resulting bound states.
4. Subjective time development by quantum jumps implies quantum self-organization which can
be regarded as a sequence of quantum jumps between quantum histories. This evolution cor-
responds to a sequence of superposition of macroscopic space-time surfaces associated with the
ﬁnal state quantum histories assignable to the hierarchy of CDs. Quantum jumps imply dissi-
pation at fundamental level. As in standard approach dissipation serves as a Darwinian selector
of self-organization patterns, which can represent both genes and memes. Jumping from the
bottom of a valley of the 4-D quantum spin glass energy landscape to the bottom of another
valley by a temporary delocalization in zero modes explains phase transition like processes rang-
ing from a change of protein conformation to the replacement of a habit routine by a new one.
Further new elements to the standard view about self-organization are brought by zero energy
ontology, negentropic entanglement, and hierarchy of Planck constants implying that second law
does not hold true in the standard form anymore. An especially interesting prediction is that
the CDs assignable to elementary particles correspond to macroscopic time scales. For instance,
electron corresponds to the fundamental .1 second bio-rhythm.
The role of energy feed in self-organization becomes more complex in TGD framework. Learning
becomes a fundamental process since state function reduction for negentropically entangled
states is not random process anymore and in the ﬁrst approximation the powers of unitary
process deﬁne an iterative self-organization process.
In this framework one can in principle
understand how habits, skills and behavioral patterns are gradually learned. The possibility of
the reversal of the arrow of the geometric time below p-adic time scale characterizing the system
brings in time reversed dissipation identiﬁable as a healing. Bio-rhytms could quite generally
correspond to dissipation-healing cycles. Motor action could be understood as geometric time
reversal for the build-up of sensory representation in an appropriate time scale.
This process gives deep insight to a repertoire of widely diﬀerent phenomena.
1. The formation of bound and negentropically entangled states implies subjectotemporal fractality
of consciousness meaning that the basic anatomy of quantum jump is replicated in various time
scales, even that of human life cycle.

5.1. Introduction
253
2. Both kinds of entanglements mean fusion of mental images. In entropic fusion subselves lose
their consciousness whereas negentropic fusion accompanies the experience about expansion of
consciousness. Depending on the character of entangling selves (real or p-adic for some p), one
can assign to the negentropic entanglement some positively colored experience, say experience
of understanding or experience of love. Telepathic sharing of mental images and remote mental
interactions become possible. Sexual and spiritual experiences can be seen manifestations of
the same basic process of fusion of selves and sex would be present even at the molecular level.
For instance, information molecules and receptors entangling negentropically could be seen as
having opposite molecular sexes with the binding of the information molecule to receptor giving
rise to the experience of ’oneness’ and favoring co-operation instead of competition.
3. If the randomness of the outcome of the ordinary state function reduction means free choice, then
self can choose to some degree whether subself ends up to a state in which it can decompose to
subselves by state function reduction or becomes a entropic or negentropic subself stable against
state function reduction. Maybe this choice could be seen as a choice between good and evil.
4. For negentropically bound states the powers of unitary process U deﬁne a sequence quantum
computer type processes. More concretely, the combination of the notions of magnetic body and
hierarchy of Planck constants leads to a model of DNA as topological quantum computer [K23]
.
Zero energy ontology and 4-dimensionality of the ensemble of computations assignable to
sub-CDs mean deviations from the standard model for quantum computation.
5. The binding energy liberated in the formation of bound state entanglement is usable energy: this
means quantum metabolism based on buy now-pay later mechanism. Negentropic entanglement
in turn can carry positive energy and there is a large temptation to assume that metabolic energy
is transferred in this manner so that the somewhat nebulous notion of high energy phosphate
bond would involve new physics.
The general vision about diﬀerent types of conscious experiences and about qualia was discussed
in [K43] . In this chapter a general model of personal sensory representations is considered: in [K28] a
more detailed model for these representations is discussed. The so called magnetospheric sensory and
memory representations possibly responsible for the third person aspect of consciousness are discussed
in [K39] .
5.1.2
The quantum hardware
The model involves the following basic notions and ideas about the quantal hardware of consciousness.
1. TGD universe is quantum spin glass and the plasticity of the brain is in accordance with a model
of brain as point moving in an inﬁnite-dimensional spin glass energy landscape.
Inhibitory
and excitatory nerve pulses induce motion in the energy landscape and justify the notion of
frustration characterizing spin glass. The picture diﬀers from ordinary neural net in that spin
glass energy landscape has also time as one dimension in a well deﬁned sense (this is due to the
failure of the classical determinism in standard sense for the K¨ahler action deﬁning the dynamics
of the system). This allows a new view about what happens in learning.
2. The general model of sensory experience relies on the music metaphor. Axons are like strings
of a music instrument. What this metaphor means is however not obvious. Frequency coding
relates only the intensity of the sensory quale. Nerve pulses induce dropping of various ions to
magnetic ﬂux tubes in magnetic ﬁelds of ≃.2 Gauss (Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld has nominal value
.5 Gauss) and this generates EEG MEs at EEG frequencies serving as entanglers to the sensory
magnetic canvas, and the variation of these frequencies could code for the distance to the object
of the perceptive ﬁeld.
A stronger interpretation of the metaphor sould be that sensory pathways are like strings of
a musical instrument such that the sound produced by the string corresponds to a particular
sensory modality and corresponding higher level cognitive representations associated with it.
Primary sensory qualia can be associated with sensory receptors or primary sensory organ if
brain and sensory organs are quantum entangled with each other. Nerve pulse patterns would

254
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
build up what could be regarded as notes representing the music whereas the music (primary
sensory qualia) is produced by the primary sensory organs. This leads to a generalization of the
idea about brain as an associative, cognitive net.
3. The notion of self hierarchy is central for the model and allows to understand quantum correlates
of the sensory qualia.
(a) Self hierarchy is very much analogous to the hierarchy of subprograms of a computer pro-
gram and deﬁnes a hierarchy of increasingly abstract experiences. Self hierarchy allows
to understand computational aspects of brain although connectionistic picture realized as
quantum association network seems to work at various levels of the hierarchy.
(b) The empirical results [J139] about the eﬀects of oscillating em ﬁelds on brain suggest that
cyclotron frequencies, and more generally magnetic transition frequencies, of biologically
important ions in magnetic ﬁeld B ≃.2 Gauss, which is by a factor 2/5 weaker then
the magnetic ﬁeld of Earth, correspond to important oscillation frequencies of Josephson
currents or some other perturbations acting on the system. Also the magnetic transition
frequencies of electronic Cooper pairs seem to be important as perhaps also Z0 magnetic
transition frequencies of neutrino and various ions and atoms and even molecules. Classi-
cally cyclotron frequency for Josephson current corresponds to resonance.
(c) The role of massless extremals (MEs) have become more and more central in TGD inspired
theory of consciousness as I have gradually understood their properties. Very brieﬂy, MEs
are ideal for both classical and quantum communications, they give rise to quantum holo-
grams both in quantum gravitational and ’technological’ sense. MEs make also possible
the realization of long term memories as communications between future and past. The
notion of conscious hologram makes these ideas very concrete.
(d) The strange ﬁndings challenging the notions of ionic channels and pumps lead to the view
about biosystem as a symbiosis of MEs, superconducting magnetic ﬂux tube structures, and
atomic space-time sheets. The latter two are in many-sheeted ionic ﬂow equilibrium con-
trolled by MEs and very elegant control mechanisms based on the classical em interaction
between MEs and ﬂux tubes inducing supra currents emerges.
(e) Self hierarchy has as its geometric correlate the hierarchy of CDs the level of imbedding
space and the hierarchy of space-time sheets at space-time level. The fact that Josephson
currents associated with ELF frequencies generate photons with wavelengths of size of
Earth which by uncertainty principle correspond to topological ﬁeld quanta with size of
Earth. The only possible conclusion seems to be that our subselves correspond to (at least)
these topological ﬁeld quanta so that we are much more than our neurons.
(f) It took years to arrive to the conclusion that also magnetic ﬂux tube structures associated
with various parts of brain could have same size as EEG MEs and serve as sensory canvas in
the sense that the positions of objects of perceptive ﬁeld are represented as subselves at the
magnetic ﬂux tubes of varying thickness woken-up by MEs generating magnetic transition
frequencies. Obviously MEs and magnetic ﬂux tubes associated with the sensory projectors
must be very closely related (perhaps they are parallel to achieve Alfwen wave resonance).
Various attributes associated with the object of the perceptive ﬁeld are associated with
these magnetic subselves and brain, or rather entire central nervous system, can be seen
as a collection of pre-existing features of perceptive ﬁeld which can be activated. Also long
term memory recall can be understood in this framework as a communication between
geometric now and geometric past made possible by MEs (which correspond to lightlike
selves) and magnetic ﬂux tube structures associated with brain, both having astrophysical
sizes.
5.1.3
Me as a computer sitting at its own terminal?
It became as a surprise that the vision resulting from a long lasting thought experimentation is actually
very much what the original, now twenty ﬁve year old, altered state of consciousness experience about
myself as a computer sitting at its own terminal, when taken very literally in some aspects, actually
suggests. This vision adds to the standard view about brain an additional layer responsible for the

5.1. Introduction
255
sensory representations and brings in the quantum level of control (possibly from magnetic body) so
that nerve pulse patterns are only part of the control loop.
1. Magnetic ﬂux tube structures serve as a sensory canvas analogous to the computer screen. The
control commands realized by activating MEs, in which state they create coherent states of
photons and possibly also other gauge bosons, generate magnetic quantum phase transitions,
and induce supra currents, Josephson currents and Ohmic currents, provide a realization for the
keyboard of this computer. Brain serves as central processing unit: the computations carried
out are parallel computations and program modules are replaced by various self-organization
patterns.
2. Motor actions and sensory representations diﬀer in that they are time reversals of each other in
a relevant p-adic time scale.
3. What imagined motor actions and sensory experience mean is not quite clear.
(a) The ﬁrst view is that for imagined motor actions and sensory experiences the ﬁrst (rather
than last as one might think!) step in the sequence of commands is simply not realized.
For sensory experiences the ﬁrst step means sensory input assuming that primary sensory
qualia are at the level of sensory receptors. A real motor action proceeds like a geometric
time reversal of the sensory input and starts from motor organs if it is real, and from some
higher level if it is imagined. p-Adic-to-real phase transition is the basic step initiating
neural activity leading to imagery.
(b) A more quantal view about imagination is based on the notion zero energy states with
time-like negentropic entanglement. In this case qubits and more general states are always
fuzzy so that Schr¨odinger cat is never completely alive or completely dead. Suppose one
takes a zero energy for which nothing happens and adds to it a little bit of state for which
the imagined event happens. The higher the probability of the imagined event is, the nearer
the imagined event is to a real event.
4. Cortex can be seen as a collection of pre-existing cognitive features which are activated when
they appear in the perceptive ﬁeld or form a part of motor action. The basic task of cortex is
to identify these features from the sensory input, entangle them with sensory input, and project
to the magnetic body.
5. The decomposition of the perceptive ﬁeld into objects is one of the basic aspects of sensory
experiencing and TGD provides a mechanism generating these objects as mindlike space-time
sheets: the boundaries of these objects correspond to regions of strong K¨ahler electric ﬁeld
whose strength is assumed to correlate with the intensity of the neural input.
It might be
that even the objects of perceptive ﬁeld or thoughts could be regarded as features.
At the
neuronal level one ends up to a model in which neurotransmitters at the ends of magnetic ﬂux
tubes attach to receptors at the ends of magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting cell membrane and
DNA and give in this manner rise to a fusion of the pre- and post-synaptic mentl images. In
contrast to standard neuroscience view, gene level would be involved in an essential manner in
the information processing. U process could be described as a generalized Feynman diagram in
which synaptic transmissions replace particle exchanges and for negentropically entangled states
learning would correspond to a sequence of powers of U.
6. The computational activities associated with the construction of the sensory representations (say
estimating distances and directions of the objects of perceptive ﬁeld) and virtual sensory repre-
sentations representing the goals of motor action are presumably realized as iterated processes
in which virtual sensory inputs characterizing the expected experiences are compared with the
real world sensory input. In a similar manner the goal of the motor action is compared with the
sensory representation resulting from eﬀect of a virtual motor action on the representation of
the recent state of world and body. This comparison does not necessarily require sensory rep-
resentation at any level of the self hierarchy and could be based on comparison circuits deﬁned
by parallel supra currents in which the inputs which are suﬃciently near to each other generate
constructive interference giving rise to a large Josephson current. The fractal hierarchy of CDs
coming as octaves of CD size and the hierarchy of Planck constants in principles makes possible

256
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
zooming up and down possible so that simulations can be carried out in time scales smaller than
that characterizing self.
7. The neural realization of long term memories has remained to a high extent a mystery and
TGD suggests that the fundamental realization is not in fact neural. TGD allows the geometric
memory storage in the geometric past, where the things happened and still happen. MEs suggest
several candidates for the memory recall mechanisms and the quantum communication between
geometric future and past is one of the most promising ones. Active memory recall might involve
a question sent to the geometric past as a classical signal, perhaps MEs are involved at this stage.
In the case of episodal memory the answer would involve the generation of time-like negentropic
quantum entanglement: the recalled experience is shared by the experiencer now and in the
geometric past. For declarative memories outside the intersection of real and p-adic worlds the
communication of the memory would be classical.
8. The model of intentionality is mirror image of the model of long term memories obtained by
real→p-adic and geometric past→geometric future replacements.
5.2
General ideas about hardware of consciousness
In this section general ideas and metaphors about what quantum brain and quantum brain functioning
might be, are summarized. These ideas have developed gradually during last decade and continue to
do so. The recent view about brain conforms with the great sixteen years old vision about self as a
computer sitting at its own terminal.
This vision, if taken completely seriously, means that the ultimate sensory representation conscious-
to-us is outside the brain: that this is the case became clear quite recently (the geometric now when
I am writing this is October, 2001). The title of this section is ’General ideas about hardware of
consciousness’. rather than ’General ideas about brain’. The reason is that brain and body in TGD
Universe form only a tiny part of a system involving hierarchy of MEs and magnetic ﬂux tube structures
having astrophysical sizes controlling the matter at the atomic space-time sheets deﬁning brain and
body in the usual sense of the world.
I defend this radical deviation from the standard wisdom by the fact that the world ’consciousness’
has ceased to be a taboo only during the last decade. It would be really astonishing if the materialistic
view about consciousness as an illusion and brain as a computer would generalize to a general theory
of consciousness just by adding one candle to the birthday cake of one century of brain science. Just
like the creation of physics at the times of Kepler meant revolution in Earth centered world picture,
also the creation of the general theory of consciousness is bound to mean thoroughgoing changes in
the basic prejucides about human consciousness.
5.2.1
Brain as a computer
Brain as a computer metaphor in sense of Turing machine has been one of the dominating metaphors
about brain functioning. In TGD this metaphor makes sense as far as general functional architecture
of modern computer is considered. Programs must be however replaced by self-organization patterns.
Brain as a computer sitting at its own terminal
My personal great experience involved the realization that I am in some sense a computer sitting at
its own terminal. It took more than one and half decades to realize what this self-referential idea
having deep mystic coloring in it might mean in practice. Actually I realized the connection only after
having ended up to this kind of view about brain by quite diﬀerent routes.
To be precise, ’computer’ does not mean in the recent context the abstract Turing machine,
but a real world personal computer. The concrete functional and geometric architecture seems to
be mimicked by personal computers, not the detailed data processing. the deterministic computer
programs are replaced by much more ﬂexible self-organization patterns.
1. Brain corresponds to the central processing unit of this computer. The data in computer memory
are typically represented at computer monitor which is outside the central unit, can have much

5.2. General ideas about hardware of consciousness
257
larger size and be located arbitrary far away. In the case of brain this means that the ultimate,
conscious-to-me sensory representations are realized outside brain at superconducting magnetic
ﬂux tube structures associated with various parts of brain. This view is inspired by very simple
observation: when my eyes or my head move, I do not experience that the sensory image of
external world moves although its physical representation in brain moves.
As if I were an
external observed looking the projection of sensory data on canvas inside brain so that the
motion of canvas does not matter.
The standard argument is that the fact that brain constructs sensory representations about the
motion of eyes, head, and body, is enough to generate the experience that the world is not
moving. At least in TGD framework it is extremely diﬃcult to understand how the sensory
image of the external world in motion would not give rise to the experience that the world is in
motion. I see the failure to realize this point as one of the fatal consequences of computationalism
decoupled from physics: the ability to calculate what really happens does not simply give rise
to the experience what really happens in the world of physics.
2. In computer the representation of the data on monitor, printing of data, and even various control
actions such as the control of a robot reduces to sending of ﬁles to various kinds of receivers: the
data is just expressed in various manners. In case of brain this means that that the processes
leading to sensory experience or motor action diﬀer only in their last steps. If the last step
is not present, imagined motor action or sensory experience is in question. Imagination would
involve as a seed p-adic cognitive representation, which is transformed by a p-adic-to-real phase
transition to a real form, which in turn serves as initiating cell membrane oscillation pattern
leading to an almost sensory experience or almost motor action (also nerve pulse patterns might
be involved).
This picture leads to a very general view about sensory representations and motor actions. In this
picture also ”features” reduce to MEs and this might be too strong an assumption.
1. Brain can be regarded as a collection of standard feature records represented by MEs. These
features represent basic features of objects of perceptive ﬁeld and primitive elements of motor
actions. The set of feature MEs is pre-existing and realization of the sensory image or motor
action only activates a subset of these MEs. In principle the locations of feature MEs could be
more or less random which means extreme ﬂexibility and ability to adapt to new situations.
2. The basic frequency associated with a particular sensory ME codes for the distance of the object
of the perceptive ﬁeld and the direction of ME codes for its direction. Sensory MEs are naturally
organized in radial bundles, ﬁles, representing various directions for the objects of perceptive
ﬁeld at given distance. Feature MEs with nearly the same frequency generate magnetic quantum
phase transitions waking up magnetic self in the desired distance on the magnetic sensory canvas
and thus assign to the object of the perceptive ﬁeld various kinds of attributes. This means
nothing but frequency binding and leads to what might be called spectroscopy of consciousness:
EEG acts like a spectrogram allowing to deduce information about the functional state of brain.
3. Support for the view that sensory input and motor activities are very similar comes from motor
synesthesia in which person can represent the sensory input by dancing it! More concretely, the
realization of intention as motor action reduces to generation of MEs propagating along axons
and generating desired membrane oscillation and nerve pulse patterns. There might be however
a crucial diﬀerence also: motor action could be a geometric time reversal for the construction
of a sensory representation and start from a rough sketch in the geometric now and develop
quantum jump by quantum jump to a detailed plan in the geometric past.
Time reversed
dissipation would polish a sketch to a precise plan. Motor action would start from the motor
organs and proceed to the level of brain.
4. Brain can be said to contain a collection of passive sensory and motor features which it activates
selectively. This brings in mind computer game containing large number of extremely simple ﬁles,
for instance sound ﬁles producing Aaaargh’s and Auuuch’s. The activation of ME record could
mean ME is color rotated by coherent state of conﬁguration space photons to electromagnetic
ME which in turn generates coherent state of photons and conﬁguration space photons acting

258
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
as a control command; activates magnetic quantum phase transitions; induces supra currents;
or something else. Similar mechanism works even at the level of DNA where genes can be coded
to various kinds of control commands by activating the associated MEs.
What this view implies that there is no need to worry about how brain realizes ultimate sensory
representations inside brain as neural activities. What remains to be understood how brain develops
into a collection of the standard features; how brain recognizes the standard features from the incoming
sensory input; how brain evaluates the distances and orientations and other data related to the objects
of the perceptive ﬁeld; how brain decomposes the perceptive ﬁeld into objects; and many other things
not listed here.
1. Feature recognition might be based on comparison circuits based on supra current circuits. Ex-
pected features would be represented as standard patterns of supra currents. When the pattern
of supra currents associated with the sensory input and running parallel to those of expected
sensory input is suﬃciently near to the expected one, a resonant generation of Josephson currents
occurs and gives rise to a recognition of the feature.
2. The positions and other geometric data about the objects of perceptive ﬁeld are presumably esti-
mated by an iterative process in which the sensory input from the virtual world construct of the
perceptive ﬁeld is compared with the real sensory input which could be sustained in the sensory
circuits. Cortico-thalamic communications might relate to this iteration. The comparison takes
place by comparison circuits and when the two inputs resemble each other suﬃciently, a sensory
output at the magnetic canvas is generated. The consistency of these two representations should
be gained gradually through learning and by the requirement of consistency between diﬀerent
sensory inputs. Similar comparisons are involved with the development of motor action to yield
the ﬁnal action giving rise to the desired goal.
Brain as a motor and sensory organ of higher level selves
Certainly the most dramatic deviation from the standard neuroscience implied by this view is the
prediction of an entire hierarchy of MEs and magnetic selves using brain as a generalized sensory
and motor organ. We correspond to only one level in this hierarchy making decisions and controlling
the behavior of our body in certain time scale. For instance, long term goals and socially acceptable
behavior could be seen as forced by selves at the higher levels of the hierarchy. Drives could perhaps
seen as activities forced by lower level selves in the hierarchy (amygdala and other parts of paleobrain
contra neocortex).
What makes this so dramatic is that the sizes of our magnetic bodies could
be astrophysical (here one must of course be very cautious: the realization of long term memories
however encourages strongly this view). For instance, EEG ME and corresponding magnetic ﬂux tube
structures would both have sizes measured using Earth size as a unit.
A possible mechanism for the motor control from our own sensory canvas as well as from the
sensory canvases of higher level selves is provided by MEs. The classical gauge ﬁelds entering to brain
and body would represent very high level commands, and might be transformed to endogenous sounds
by piezoelectric eﬀect identiﬁable as internal speech (internal speech could also correspond to p-adic
MEs). This is only one possibility. The construction of the model of nerve pulse and EEG leads to
quite general model for the interaction of MEs as bridges between two space-time sheets characterized
by diﬀerent p-adic primes, and inducing a ﬂow of charge between the two space-time sheets, inducing
in turn a ﬂow of em charge, and in case of cell membrane a change of membrane potential leading to
the triggering of the nerve pulse. The reduction of the eﬀective phase velocity of ME to the conduction
velocity of nerve pulse or of some other excitation involves the shift of entire ME to future occurring
in each quantum jump. If the shift occurs in the direction of geometric past, a super-luminal eﬀective
phase velocity results. Both cases might be involved, and would correspond naturally to propagating
and standing EEG waves and to the spacelike and timelike soliton sequences predicted by the model
for Josephson junctions.
Boolean mind and memetic code
The original proposal for the realization of Boolean mind was in terms of sequences cognitive neutrino
pairs. These can be interpreted as wormhole contacts carrying neutrino and antineutrino at the light-
like wormhole throats and would thus represent boson like entities. In the framework of the standard

5.2. General ideas about hardware of consciousness
259
model the proposal looks of course completely non-sensical. TGD however predicts the existence of
long range classical electro-weak ﬁelds, and one might imagine that inside neutrino- whose Compton
length corresponds to length scale of cell- intermediate gauge bosons behave like massless ﬁelds.
Although neutrinos could be important, the time scale of corresponding CD - about 104 years -
suggests that cognitive neutrinos might be important in much longer time scale than the .1 second
time scale assignable to the memetic code.
The recent view about TGD allows a much more general view. Zero energy ontology allows to
interpret the fermionic parts of zero energy states as quantum superpositions of Boolean statements of
form a →b with a and b represented in terms of positive and negative energy parts of the zero energy
state. If one has negentropic entanglement this kind of state has interpretation as an abstraction - a
”law of physics”- representing as a quantum superposition various instances of a more general law.
The simplest situation corresponds to a CD having only single positive energy fermion and negative
energy fermion at its light-like boundaries. The fermion number or spin or isospin of the fermion could
represent qubit. The hypothesis that memetic code corresponds to the next level of Combinatorial
Hierarchy, when combined with p-adic length scale hypothesis, led to a prediction of order .1 seconds
for the duration of the ’wake-up’ period of subself corresponding to the codeword of the memetic code.
Since the CD assignable to electron has time scale .1 seconds and the CD assignable to u and d quarks
has time scale 1/1.28 milliseconds there is a temptation to proposed that the quark-like sub-CDs of
electronic CD give to a realization of memetic code word as a sequence of 126 quark like sub-CDs.
u and d quarks would be assigned to the magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting DNA and the lipids of the
cell membrane in the model of DNA as topological quantum computer. Clearly, beautiful connection
between new elementary particle physics, genetic code, nerve pulse activity, DNA as topological
quantum computer, logical thought, and the basic time scales of speech are suggestive.
This codeword consists of 126 bits represented by quarks such that the two possible magnetization
directions correspond to the two values of Boolean statement. This implies that the duration of single
bit should 1/1260 seconds. The duration of the nerve pulse is slightly longer than this which might
mean that the full memetic code is realized as membrane oscillations rather than nerve pulse patterns.
Both hearing and vision have .1 second time scale as a fundamental time scale and sounds are indeed
coded to membrane oscillations in ear.
One can consider also the realization of genetic code with six bits of the codon represented by
various scaled up versions of quark CD coming as size powers of 2. In this case the ordering of the
bits would come from the size of sub-CD whereas in previous example temporal ordering would deﬁne
the ordering. It is not however clear whether the powers of two can be realized physically.
One can understand the number 126 as related to the total number of separately experienced
frequencies in the interval 20 −20.000 Hz spanning 10 octaves. 10 × 12 = 120 is not far from 126:
here 12 corresponds to 12 tones of basic music scale. Also speech has 10 Hz frequency as fundamental
frequency. In visual primary cortex replicating triplets, 4-,5- and 6-plets of spikes with highly regular
intervals between spikes have been detected. The triplets are accompanied by ghost doublets. This
would suggest a coding of some features of visual experience to reverberating mental images. The
time scale for various patterns is .1 seconds. This could be seen as a support for the realization of
some degenerate version of the memetic code as nerve pulse patterns.
The model for the memetic code encourages the following conclusions.
1. Membrane oscillation/nerve pulse patterns correspond to temporal sequences of magnetization
directions for quarks representing yes/no Boolean statements.
2. The spin polarization of quarks is changed from the standard direction ﬁxed by the spontaneous
magnetization in the direction of axon by a ME moving parallel to axon, and inducing membrane
oscillation or even a nerve pulse. Nerve pulses could correspond to a degenerate memetic code
resulting by frequency coding for which the number of distinguishable code words is 64, and
would thus naturally correspond to the reduction of the memetic code to the genetic code.
A very precise correspondence with the basic structures of the genetic code results. mRNA →
protein translation corresponds to the translation of temporal sequences o magnetization directions to
conscious cognitive experiences. Under very natural constraints the mapping to cognitive experiences
is not one-to-one and the predicted degeneracy (2126 sequences correspond to (2126 −1)/63 cognitive
experiences) can be understood.

260
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
One might think that the full memetic code is an evolutionary newcomer and involved only with
the logical thought: this would explain the completely exceptional characteristics of human brain. The
full memetic codecould be realized for certain regions of brain only. These regions certainly include
auditory pathways responsible for the comprehension of speech [K31, K61, K62, K65] .
5.2.2
Brain, MEs, and quantum holograms
MEs represent a communication link in the control hierarchy formed by the magnetic body having
onion like structure consisting of superconducting magnetic ﬂux tube structures and ﬂux sheets car-
rying dark matter, and space-time sheets carrying visible matter, and would be thus involved with
the fundamental control operations. EEG MEs and they fractal variants could mediate classical sig-
nals and act as time-like entanglers assigning mental images to the points of the magnetic body with
distance to the magnetic body being coded by the length of ME and the direction of the point by
the direction of ME. Of course, also the deformations of magnetic ﬂux tubes could mediate classical
signals as counterparts of Alfwen waves, and magnetic ﬂux tubes are natural space-like entanglers -
the model of DNA as topological quantum computer as an example about this function.
A possible vision about how MEs act as communication links between magnetic body
and biological body
One can imagine large number of options for how the MEs are concretely involved with biology and I
have done so. The recent view about TGD inspired biology allows to consider a highly unique model
for how MEs could perform their role as a communication link.
1. The most plausible one is that MEs associate with the communications between biological body
and magnetic body are generated by genome acting as a kind of relay station. For this option
MEs attached to the ﬂux tube going through the passive DNA strand would mediate sensory
data from the cellular environment to the magnetic body. The sensory data from environment
would arrive through magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting biomolecules and lipids of cell membrane
to the passive DNA strand analogous to sensory areas of cortex.
2. Magnetic body could induce nerve pulse activity as one particular form of gene expression by
ME attached to the ﬂux sheet going through the active DNA strand. Rapid signalling along
ﬂux tubes connecting DNA nucleotides and lipids would make this gene expression much faster
than the ordinary one. Also nerve pulse activity would be communicated to the magnetic body
from the lipid layers of neuron membrane via genome and magnetic body could generate it It is
of course possible that also reﬂex like nerve pulse activity which does not involve magnetic body
is present. From the time scale of the nerve pulse the size scale of the layer of the magnetic
body involved with nerve pulse activity must correspond to quark CDs and would be about
10−5 meters. This ﬁts nicely with the vision about DNA as topological quantum computer.
3. EEG MEs could be automatically generated as an outcome of nerve pulse activity, when ions
drop to the ﬂux quanta of magnetic ﬁeld B ≃.2 Gauss (Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld has nominal
value .5 Gauss), and entangle mental images with the points of the sensory magnetic canvas.
This vision is of course not the only one that one can imagine.
As discussed in [K62] , ge-
netic/memetic code could also have translation to control commands represented by pairs of MEs
orthogonal to DNA strand/axon. In latter case orthogonal pairs of MEs must move along axon with
the same velocity as nerve pulse pattern. Stationary EEG MEs translate the nerve pulse patterns to
the patterns of lightlike vacuum currents. TGD based model of EEG and nerve pulse [K62] predicts
two kinds of EEG waves: moving and stationary, and it might be that they correspond to these
two kinds of codings. The properties of moving/stationary EEG waves suggest their association to
left/right brain hemisphere. Left brain might favour the coding of memetic codons to moving EEG
ME pairs whereas right brain might favour the coding of nerve pulse patterns to stationary EEG MEs.
The notion of neural window
The notion of neural window, which was the original form of the hologram idea, allows to see infor-
mation processing in brain from a slightly diﬀerent point of view.

5.2. General ideas about hardware of consciousness
261
1. Massless extremals act as quantum antennae and generate coherent light and also provide waveg-
uides along which BE condensed photons can propagate like Cooper pairs in super conductor.
The photons radiated by the space-time sheets representing objects of the perceptive ﬁeld and
propagating along microtubules could provide neurons with a neuronal window. This picture
would abstract just the bare essentials of the idea of hologrammic brain: small piece of hologram
is like a small window yielding the same picture as larger window but in blurred form.
2. Massless extremals associated with neural activity could also represent or be accompanied by
association sequences making possible geometric memories representing simulations of future and
past. What is mysterious from the point of view of the standard neuroscience is that left part of
the body sends sensory stimuli to the right brain hemisphere and vice versa. In TGD framework
the mystery disappears: the maximization of the axonal lengths maximizes the durations of the
association sequences and hence optimizes geometric memory.
3. Neuronal window idea would perhaps make it possible to realize the idea about iterative com-
putation of conscious experiences involving guesses and comparisons. Neuronal windows would
generate representations of various perceptive landscapes in disjoint parts of thalamus (sensory
organs feed their input in separate parts of thalamus) and mental imagery would construct
guesses for the cognitive representations for the objects of the external world realized in the
cortex as mindlike space-time sheets radiating coherent light. The neural pathways from cortex
to thalamus would provide thalamus with a neural window to cortex and comparison of the
landscapes from cortex and sensory organ would be possible. Simple comparison circuits might
be at work: neuron would ﬁre when its neural windows to the cortex and sensory organ give
suﬃciently similar views.
4. One can sharpen the neuronal window idea by combining it with the music metaphor. This
would mean that the massless extremal associated with a given axon would correspond to a
Bose-Einstein condensate of photons (or conﬁguration space photons) with one particular fre-
quency. This would mean vision at neuronal level (nothing to do with our vision realized in EEG
frequency scale). Thus one can say that each neuronal window is either covered by curtains or
provides a view to single sensory landscape at single frequency.
The experiments of Mark Germine
MEs could also serve as a communication link between living matter and magnetic bodies representing
levels of collective consciousness responsible for the cultural aspects of our consciousness.
The experiments of Mark Germine [J67] provide evidence for the notion of ELF self and associated
collective memory. What was studied was the evoked EEG response to a series of random quantum
stimuli, which consisted of series of identical stimuli with randomly located deviant stimulus. Two
subject persons, A and B, were involved, the ﬁrst one experienced stimuli as pictures in computer
monitor, the second one as sounds. In case that A observed the diﬀering stimulus 1 second before
B, the evoked EEG response of B became incoherent. Since evoked stimulus was oscillation at EEG
frequency of about 11 Hz in case that A had not observed the stimulus, one could understand the
mechanism as a direct evidence for collective ’ELF ME’ at this frequency interacting with brains of
both A and B. When ELF ME had already heard the stimulus once, it did not react to it in similar
manner. Rather interestingly, 11 Hz corresponds to the 10.7 Hz cyclotron frequency associated with
Fe++ ion in a magnetic ﬁeld of .2 Gauss (Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld has nominal value of .5 Gauss).
Ca++ cyclotron frequency in this ﬁeld is equal to 15 Hz and would explain the eﬀects of ELF ﬁelds
on vertebrate brain occurring at harmonics of this frequency.
MEs and long term memory
MEs provide a mechanism of long term memory which diﬀers from ordinary sensory perception only
in that the ME giving rise to a geometric memory has much longer duration with respect to the
geometric time than the ME giving rise to ordinary sensory perception. To remember classically is to
look at a mirror located at a distance of light years. The ends and branching points of magnetic ﬂux
tubes are good candidates for the mirrors where MEs are reﬂected.
In TGD framework synaptic strengths code only cognitive representations and learned associations,
not genuine information about events of the geometric past.
Long term memory is coded in the

262
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
classical em ﬁeld and in coherent light generated by ME in hologram like manner. Any ﬁnite space-
time region receiving the classical em ﬁeld of coherent light generated by it gets hologram like picture
containing info about entire geometric time interval spanned by ME. If vacuum current is localized to
some restricted space-time region (it can be!), the hologrammic information is about this region and
receiver anywhere along the ME gets more or less the same information since hologram is in question.
ELF selves can perhaps control this localization. Note also that the lightlikeness of the boundary of
ME implies that ME selves have temporal extension deﬁned by the length of ME.
The fact that memory is stored to the moment of geometric time at which event occurred explains
why we know that mental image is memory. It is quite possible that MEs are involved with sensory
perception, say vision and auditory experience, and make possible to develop time-like entanglement
(possibly negentropic) with the sources of light as belonging to the external world. Geometric memory
allows also understand identiﬁcation experiences and transpersonal experiences in which person can
experience events of the distant past not related to the personal history. Anticipation of future in
turn could be also understood as particular kind of geometric memory, the MEs involved are now
p-adic representation intentions, plans, and expectations. Later a more detailed model of long term
memories will be developed.
5.2.3
Generalized notions of sensory experiencing and motor activity
The general view about brain is as a system moving of a fractal energy landscape of quantum spin
glass containing valleys inside valleys inside... Brain is not only an on observer of the external world
but also of its own position in the spin glass landscape.
Brain is not only activator of ordinary
motor programs but generates also movements in the spin glass energy landscape. Thus the general
functional division sensory experience-motor action generalizes and provides completely new insights
to the brain circuitry and functioning. For instance, one could perhaps understand why neural loops
are bi-directional. The ﬁrst loop provides sensory information about the position of brain region in
its spin glass landscape and the second loop mediates the motor action: just like in case of the spinal
chord.
The sensory experiences giving information about spin glass landscape can be interpreted as giv-
ing rise to a generalized sensory and emotional input. Emotions correspond to entropy gradients of
various types for selves. A mental image with a positive/negative emotional color results from negen-
tropy/entropy feed to subself. If the sign of entropy feed to mental images correlates with the entropy
gradient of the system represented by subself, emotions become sensory qualia. Emotions provide
perhaps the most important ’Is it going well’ type information about the state of brain and body.
Entropy gradients can be also used as an active control tool: subselves are rewarded by negentropy
feed and punished by a entropy feed. Note that the generalized motor action inducing motion in the
spin glass landscape is identiﬁable as emotional expression and generates entropy gradients and thus
emotions.
5.2.4
The paradigm of four-dimensional brain
Four-dimensionality of brain is crucial for the understanding long term memories as multitime expe-
riences receiving contributions from several moments of geometric time. This identiﬁcation makes it
unnecessary to have any memory storage mechanisms. Rather, the activities of the memory circuits
can be seen as increasing the probability that memory recall occurs. Reverberating memory circuits in
which experience is echoed indeed do this by extending the deep memory valley in spin glass landscape
to a long canyon in time direction. This increases the probability that mindlike space-time sheets enter
in the region of four-dimensional spin glass landscape representing the memory. The deepness of the
spin glass valley correlates with the emotionality of the memory. Childhood memories are especially
emotional and therefore stable. Memories are result of creative action and memory circuit involving
hippocampus seem to be active in carving out the art works representing geometric memories worth
of remembering. TGD based approach solves the basic problems of the neural net approach resulting
from the fact that the formation of new memories destroys old memories and from the fact that it is
diﬃcult to understand how the component of experience is known to be a memory.
Four-dimensional brain provides a completely new view about how gemeralized sensory experiences
are generated, how generalized motor actions are planned and how memories are constructed. This
process is like creating an artwork. Four-dimensional spin glass landscape representing a rough scetch

is gradually reﬁned by adding details and corrections in increasingly shorter time scales: this corre-
sponds to neural activities of four-dimensional brain generating motion leading to the desired part
of spin glass energy landscape. This picture is consistent with the observed 1/f noise and fractality
of nerve pulse patterns. Absolutely essential is self-organization and related dissipation forcing the
Darwinian selection leading to end product which is charicature rather than photo.
5.2.5
Music metaphor and the function of the nerve pulses and EEG
Music metaphor allowing to see brain as a music instrument.
gradually changed from a guiding
principle to a prediction of TGD inspired theory. In case of brain the music played is EEG and ZEG
spectra. EEG frequencies serve as resonant frequencies at which various quantum phase transitions
occur resonantly. Various sensory qualia correlate with EEG frequencies and place coding and possibly
also temporal coding by cyclotron frequency scale is possible. Stochastic resonance and pendulum
metaphor, which are discussed in [K62] , allow to understand the mechanisms for the transformation
of EEG waves to nerve pulse patterns and vice versa.
The picture about brain as self-organizing system suggests that neurons are subject to strong
selective pressures and specialize to produce highly specialized ﬁxed components of our experience so
that music metaphor holds true. If music metaphor holds true generally, the nerve pulses involving
fast transmitters can be said to pick the strings of the sensory instrument represented by axons and
spatio-temporal patterns of nerve pulses determine the overall pattern of the sensory experience.
Nerve pulses inducing motor action in sensory landscape represent pushes and pulls in spin glass
energy landscape. These pushes and pulls induce motion in the spin glass landscape and generate
both neuronal and our emotions. It seems that simplest emotions with no association telling the cause
or object of emotion, are determined by the nerve pulse pattern only.
This picture suggests for neurotransmitters two obvious basic functions: they mediate nerve pulses
from presynaptic neuron to postsynaptic neuron and modify the properties of synapse and postsy-
naptic neuron. Fast neurotransmitters controlling directly ion channels are involved with mediation
and the relevant time scale is one millisecond: no long term change of the postsynaptic neuron is
involved. Sensory experiences and motor actions are mediated by direct neurotransmitters. Slow
neurotransmitters involving second messanger action are involved with modulation of the response of
the postsynaptic neuron and the time scales can be of order minutes. In this case the properties of
the postsynaptic neuron are changed.
Emotional reactions involve typically slow transmitters and the eﬀect of them can be regarded as a
generalized motor action inducing motion of neuron in the spin glass energy landscape of the neuron.
The large information ﬂows associated with neurotransmitters imply entropic gradients and thus also
emotions.
Some neurotransmitters such as serotonin and dopamine, which generate sensations of
pleasure, should reduce entropy and thus ﬁght against the second law of thermodynamics.
This
presumably occurs at the neuronal level and could be only represented at the level of the sensory
selves, where some other mechanisms of the entropy reduction and generation could be at work. An
interesting question relates to the warriors in the war against second law. Could glial cells play key
role here as is suggested by the observations that depression (in which mental images becomes very
entropic and emotional ﬂatness and emptiness results) involves abnormally small amount of glial cells
in forebrain and abnormally strong emotional reactions of amygdala.
One can see associations at neuronal level as formed by the pairs of input and output. Input
corresponds to the sensory experiences associated with active presynaptic neurons and output to
the activity in the axons. The postsynaptic receptors serve as sensory receptors and each neuron
could be specialized to its own sensory modalities which are same for the entire sensory pathway.
Alternatively, primary qualia are associated with the sensory receptors or sensory organs: this option
provides very elegant understanding of what imagination and dreams are. Boolean axons give rise to
’Boolean modality’ representing thoughts. Typically sensory-Boolean associations are associated with
the associative regions of brain and are realized as a fusion of mental images. The formation of an
association corresponds to the fusion of space-time sheets representing pre- and post-synaptic neurons
to single space-time sheet. The space-time sheets formed by the orbits of synaptic vesicles form the
4-dimensional join along boundaries bond. Fusion to single space-time sheet makes possible conscious
association containing both inputs and output as a single experience.
This picture also explains
the time directedness of association. ’Our’ associations are superpositions of neuronal associations
associated with various neuronal circuits.

5.2.6
Connection with the functionalistic view about brain
The basic counter argument against quantum theories of consciousness is that the so called classical
theories of brain can quite well explain all the relevant aspects of brain functioning whereas quantum
theories of consciousness seem to add very little if anything to this understanding. It seems that huge
misunderstandings are involved on both camps.
The notion of self is fundamental for consciousness. For some reason the proponents of quantum
consciousness (including me hitherto) have however failed to realize that they should perhaps try to
formulate this notion as a quantum-physical concept. Indeed, ’What is the quantum counterpart of
self’ was the bottleneck question in TGD approach and led to the ﬁnal breakthrough.
Neuroscientists (and also many quantum physicists) in turn seem to have wrong view about what
the term ’classical’ means.
This wrong view reﬂects the wrong view about time and dissipation,
which in TGD framework can be understood elegantly in terms of the subjective time development
identiﬁed as a sequence of quantum jumps between quantum histories. It is of crucial importance that
this development can occur only inside selves! Dissipation is the basic correlate of consciousness and
consciousness is the basic prerequisite of ’classicality’ understood in the erratic manner. Thus, from
the TGD point of view, Hodkin-Huxley equations have nothing to do with genuinely classical world.
Rather, they model phenomenologically the development of neurons by quantum jumps between
quantum histories. Quantum jumps (and dissipation) inside neurons is possible only because neurons
act as subselves and dissipate. Our self can be regarded as a system making something like 1038
quantum jumps per second. This implies macrotemporality but this macrotemporality has absolutely
nothing to do with classicality in the sense as it appears in the ﬁeld equations of say General Relativity.
The notion of self as quantum self-organizing system justiﬁes the use of cybernetic notions such
as circuits, loops, feedback, feedforward, inhibition and excitation. The general neuroscientist’s view
about brain as a complex neuronal circuitry ﬁnds justiﬁcation and one ends up with rather concrete
identiﬁcations for what kind of conscious (not necessary conscious to us –) experiences are associated
with various brain circuits. The essentially new elements are 4-dimensionality of brain and realization
of qualia and Boolean mind in terms of macroscopic quantum phases and these additional elements
lead to genuine understanding of what happens in brain.
The randomness of the quantum jump is certainly a strong argument against quantum theories of
consciousness and for me it took quite a long time to realize how serious this objection actually is.
One can quite well claim that it leaves only one option: standard non-equilibrium thermodynamics in
which dissipation in the presence of external energy feed selects the self-organization patterns. The
possibility of negentropic entanglement in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds is what changes
the situation and removes the randomness of quantum jump so that unitary process U and its powers
deﬁne an iterative self-organization process leading to generation of fractal structures and quantum
computation like processes possible. This makes also possible conscious goal directed actions and the
existence of genuine information rather than only lack of dis-information is what makes possible also
learning at the fundamental level.
5.2.7
Brain as an associative net
Brain can be regarded as an associative net. At neural level association is a pair of incoming axons
and outgoing axon: during synaptic transfer the space-time sheets of pre- and postsynaptic neuron
fuse to form a larger space-time sheets and the corresponding conscious experience is association
formed by the experiences determined by pre- and postsynaptic neurons. Neurons have their own
sensory qualia associated with transmitter-receptor combinations: also neuronal seeing and hearing is
possible. These qualia are probably not ours. From the point of view of our consciousness, nerve pulse
patterns are most important and give rise to symbolic representations of sensory input. Frequency
coding is involved and memetic code is reduced to genetic code. Membrane oscillations correspond to
full memetic code and higher level cognition. Emission of at least slow neural transmitter gives rise to
neuronal emotion. During synaptic ﬁring the association pair becomes conscious. The most elegant
option is that sensory qualia are at the level of primary sensory organs.
Also motor actions, in particular the transformation of Boolean statements to speech, can be re-
garded as associations of this kind. Motor action would be time reversal of sensory perception in
appropriate time scales, and the motor actions initiated from some level higher than muscle cells cor-
respond to motor imagination. Speech represents translation of memes to motor actions analogous to

5.3. Quantum tools for biocontrol and -coordination
265
the translation of genes to proteins. For instance, logical reasoning develops as associations respecting
basic rules of logic. This could explain why we are so poor in performing conscious logical deduction.
On the other hand, rules of logic could be unconsciously inherited at the level of experience pairs from
the physical world which obeys logic.
The most general possibility is that he output of a complex neuron is some function of the inputs.
Music metaphor however suggests much simpler possibility: output is the same always and repre-
sented by nerve pulse pattern inducing postsynaptic qualia which depend on the receptor-transmitter
combinations involved. This assumption has very strong consequences. Especially interesting are the
sequences of associations associated with closed neural loops. The assumption that projections are
topographically organized and that given axon is always in the same state mean that all closed circuits
are reverbatory. Thus elementary single neuron association sequences associated with various brain
circuits would be ﬁxed and nerve pulse patterns should be determined the content of various conscious
experiences constructed from these elementary experiences: the analogy with music would be very
close. This would have quite strong consequences as far as the general structure of the brain circuits
are considered.
1. Memories could quite correspond to asymptotic nerve pulse patterns reverberating in memory
circuits. Nerve pulse patterns in closed would determine the content of memory and memo-
ries would result as ﬁxed point patterns of self-organization. Very probably also microtubular
representations of long term memories are important.
2. Motor plans would be represented by nerve pulse patterns reverberating in motor circuits and
selected by self organization and realized as genuine motor actions only in case that the geomet-
rically time reversed process starts from the muscle cells.
3. In case of Boolean thoughts reverberating circuits correspond to tautologies so that one can
question the hypothesis that axons are permanently in the same state. Of course, there is no
need to assume that thoughts correspond to closed circuits.
Negentropic space-like quantum entanglement between neurons, neuronal membranes and DNA
strands, and DNA strands and magnetic body adds to this picture a further element necessary if one
wants to speak about conscious brain able to learn. Synaptic transmission becomes the molecular
counterpart of enlightment experience in which neuronal subselves experience an expansion of con-
sciousness. Learning as gradual evolution of synaptic strengths can be understood as the space-time
correlate for the evolution deﬁned by the unitary process U and its powers in the space of zero en-
ergy states representing M-matrices allowing an interpretation as abstractions describing the ”laws
of physics” as experienced by brain.
5.3
Quantum tools for biocontrol and -coordination
Coordination and control are the two fundamental aspects in the functioning of the living matter.
TGD suggests that at quantum level deterministic unitary time evolution of Dirac equation corre-
sponds to coordination whereas time evolution by quantum jumps corresponds to quantum control.
More precisely, the non-dissipative Josephson currents associated with weakly coupled super conduc-
tors would be the key element in coordination whereas resonant dissipative currents between weakly
coupled super conductors would make possible quantum control.
This view allows to considermore detailed mechanisms. What is certainly needed in the coordi-
nation of the grown up organism are biological clocks, which are oscillators coupled to the biological
activity of the organ. Good examples are the clocks coordinating the brain activity, respiration and
heart beat [I37] . For example, in the heart beat the muscle contractions in various parts of heart
occur in synchronized manner with well deﬁned phase diﬀerences. Various functional disorders, say
heart ﬁbrillation, result from the loss of this spatial coherence. For a control also biological alarm
clocks are needed. An alarm clock is needed to tell when the time is ripe for the cell to replicate
during morphogenesis. Some signal must tell that is time to begin diﬀerentiation to substructures
during morphogenesis: for example, in case of the verterbrates the generation of somites is a very
regular process starting at certain phase of development and proceeding with a clockwise precision.

5.3.1
Massless extremals, magnetic ﬂux tubes, and electrets
Massless extemals (MEs), magnetic ﬂux tubes and magnetic body, and electrets deﬁne the basic new
notions of TGD inspired theory of consciousness and quantum biology and it is good to introduce
them ﬁrst before discussing the quantum tools.
Massless extremals
The identiﬁcation of mindlike space-time sheets as ’massless extremals’ (MEs) together with the notion
of magnetic body leads to a very general vision about bio-consciousness and an explanation for the
fact that the eﬀects of ELF em ﬁelds on biomatter occur only for certain amplitude windows [J33]
(these eﬀects are discussed in detail in [K10, K11]
1. What MEs are?
Massless extremals (MEs) deﬁne a very general solution set of ﬁeld equations associated with
K¨ahler action [K33] and representing various gauge ﬁelds and gravitational [A9] [K55] . Being scale
invariant, MEs come in all size scales.
The geometry has axial symmetry in the sense that CP2
coordinates are arbitrary functions of two variables constructed from Minkowski coordinates: lightlike
coordinate t−z and arbitary function of the coordinates of the plane orthogonal to the z-axis deﬁning
the direction of propagation. The polarization of the electromagnetic ﬁeld depends on the point of
the plane but is temporally constant. MEs represent waves propagating with velocity of light in single
direction so that there is no dispersion: preservation of the pulse shape makes MEs ideal for classical
communications.
Electric and magnetic parts of various gauge ﬁelds are orthogonal to each other and to the direction
of propagation. Classical gauge has as its source lightlike vacuum current. The time dependence of
the vacuum current is arbitrary, this is only possible by its lightlikeness.
This makes it possible
to code all kinds of physical information to the time dependence of the vacuum current. MEs can
have ﬁnite spatial size and in this case they are classical counterparts of virtual photons exchanged
between charged particles and represent classical communication between material space-time sheets.
MEs carry gravitational waves and various classical color and electroweak gauge ﬁelds propagating
with light velocity.
MEs can also carry constant electric and magnetic ﬁelds but in this case the boundaries of ME
contain necessarily the sources of this ﬁeld.
Lightlike vacuum currents or elementary particles in
massless phase could serve as sources MEs could also form double-sheeted structures with wormhole
contacts serving as eﬀective sources. It took quite a time to realize that the wormhole contacts have
interpretation as gauge bosons and their super partners. Therefore quantum classical correspondence
between classical ﬁelds and ﬁeld quanta emerges automatically. In the case of single-sheeted MEs the
interpretation is as a space-time correlate for fermion or a super-partner of fermion.
TGD allows the possibility that the two sheets have opposite time orientations and therefore also
opposite classical energies.
In zero energy ontology this might be always the case for the double
sheeted MEs assigned to bosons and their super-partners. The opposite sign of the energy makes it
possible to realize virtual particles as pairs of on mass shell particles of opposite sign of energy and this
of utmost importance in the recent formulation of quantum TGD [K91] . A natural guess would be
that pairs of positive (negative) energy MEs correspond to massless on mass shell particles and pairs
of MEs with opposite energies represent naturally virtual particles. The objection is that it idiﬃcult
to understand how the spin of on mass shell gauge boson could be represented in terms of fermion
and antifermion spins associate with the throats of the wormhole contact. Massless Dirac equation
seems to allow only longitudinal net polarization for the resulting gauge bosons. The resolution of the
problem is based on modiﬁed Dirac action which mixes M 4 chiralities. This mixing is also behind the
massivation of elementary particles. Quite generally, the exchange of a double-sheeted ME between
material space-time sheets can correspond to arbitrary value of the exchanged momentum.
Also
fermions and their superpartners are assumed to topological condense in in the interaction region and
become temporarily double-sheeted but the other sheet need not be ME anymore.
This kind of structures are obvious candidates for cognitive structures since classical nondetermin-
ism is localized in a ﬁnite space-time volume and direct connection with the notion of virtual particle
characterizing the non-determinism of quantum theories emerges. World should be full of MEs with
all possible sizes since they have vanishing action: addition of ME with ﬁnite time duration yields

5.3. Quantum tools for biocontrol and -coordination
267
new absolute minimum of K¨ahler action since K¨ahler action does not change in this operation. This
suggests that MEs should be of crucial importance in TGD Universe.
2. Interaction of MEs with matter
The basic interaction mechanisms of MEs with superconducting ﬂux tubes are magnetic induction
generating supracurrents, the action of MEs as Josephson junctions between magnetic ﬂux tubes,
and magnetic quantum phase transitions stimulating radiation of coherent light which in turn BE-
condenses on MEs and deﬁnes a feedback loop.
Many-sheeted ionic ﬂow equilibrium deﬁnes the basic control mechanism with superconducting
magnetic ﬂux tubes taking the role of master and atomic space-time sheets taking the role of slave.
Magnetic phase transitions could make possible chemical senses based on an endogenous NMR type
spectroscopy. Also other than magnetic quantum transitions, such as changes of protein (in particular
enzyme-) conformations, could occur coherently at superconducting space-time sheets, so that super-
conducting space-time sheets could allow an extremely eﬀective high precision quantum control of the
biochemistry. Magnetic quantum phase transitions make possible place coding by if the thickness of
magnetic ﬂux tube varies and this coding is crucial in the model for how various features are associated
with objects of perceptive ﬁeld at a given position.
MEs allow at their lightlike boundaries representations of super conformal– and super-symplectic
algebras with gigantic almost-degeneracies of states due to the almost-commutativity of Poincare
algebra and super-symplectic algebra. Super-symplectic states deﬁne genuine quantum gravitational
state functionals in the space of three-surfaces, the ’world of classical worlds’, and correspond to a
higher abstraction level than ordinary quantum states deﬁned in the ’world’ (space-time). This ’world
of classical worlds’ aspect of quantum gravitational states explains why quantum gravity is crucial for
consciousness.
3. Possible functions of MEs
MEs serve as receiving and sending quantum antennae [K55] . Lightlike vacuum current gen-
erates coherent light. Also coherent gravitons are generated. MEs serve also as templates for BE
condensation of photons and gravitons with momenta parallel to the lightlike vacuum current. Lin-
ear structures, say DNA and microtubules, are natural but not the only candidates for structures
accompanied by MEs. Since MEs are massless, they carry maximal possible momentum. This makes
exchange of ME ideal mechanism for locomotion. The possibility of negative energy MEs is especially
fascinating since it suggests ’buy now, pay later’ mechanism of energy production: perhaps living
matter uses MEs to generate coherent motions [K57, K58] .
Perhaps the most important function of MEs in living matter is communication and control. MEs
can connect diﬀerent parts of biological body at various levels. For instance, they can be attached to
magnetic ﬂux tubes. MEs would be also involved with the communications between magnetic body
and biological body and EEG would represent one particular example of this kind of communication.
MEs would be also ideal quantum entanglers in time direction and could serve as correlates for the
mediators of negentropic quantum entanglement. The communication of sensory data to magnetic
body could take via MEs and also the control actions of magnetic body could be mediated by MEs
to biological body via MEs.
The original idea was that MEs could induce Josephson junctions and more general current carrying
bridges between bio-structures. This is possible but magnetic ﬂux tubes are more natural looking
structures in this respect because they can be stationary.
1. Since the electric ﬁeld of ME is orthogonal to the direction of the propagation of vacuum current,
the Josephson junction with potential diﬀerence is formed most naturally when super conductors
are joined by join along boundaries bonds to ME in the direction of the electric ﬁeld associated
with ME. MEs can in principle be arbitrary thin so that the thickness of Josephson junction can
be much smaller than the dominating wavelength of ME.
2. The electric ﬁeld of ME can contain also a constant component. This is possible if there is a
vacuum charge density or ordinary elementary particles in a massless phase in the time scale
considered (Higgs ﬁeld vanishes) at the boundaries of ME generating the ﬁeld. If this charge
density is absent, ME is necessary double sheeted with the constant electric and magnetic
ﬁelds created by the wormhole throats at the boundaries of ME serving as eﬀective charges.

268
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
Both single and double sheeted MEs could give rise to the Josephson junctions with a constant
potential diﬀerence. The coding of the transversal potential diﬀerence associated with ME to
Josephson frequency could be a fundamental information coding mechanism in living matter.
ME can contain also oscillating electric ﬁeld over Josephson junction at magnetic or some other
transition frequency so that MEs are ideal for control purposes.
4. MEs and the interaction of the classical em ﬁelds with biomatter
MEs acting as Josephson junctions and containing oscillating em ﬁeld at ELF frequency give rise
to a harmonic perturbation inducing quantum jumps of the magnetic states of ions and explains the
eﬀect of ELF em ﬁelds on biomatter. Also the presence of the mysterious intensity windows [J34, J39]
can be understood. Josephson current paradigm allows to understand this eﬀect if radiofrequency or
microwave MEs associated with the external ﬁeld act as Josephson junctions.
1. The external electric ﬁeld oscillating with frequency ω (now radio frequency) deﬁnes slowly
varying potential diﬀerence over Josephson junction of length d acting as Josephson junction
provided that the condition
ω ≪ωJ(max) = ZeV = ZeEd
holds true. This gives
d ≫
ω
ZeE .
For E ∼.1 V/m and ω ∼GHz which are typical values used in experiments [J33], this condition
gives d ≫10−6 meters which is satisﬁed if Josephson junctions have size not smaller than cell
length scale.
2. For ﬁxed length of Josephson junction amplitude window results if the maximal Josephson
frequency ωJ(max) is slightly above some transition frequency since in this case the stationary
maxima and minima of amplitude lead to long lasting resonant excitation of quantum transitions.
Denoting the relative width of the resonance by ∆ω/ω = P, the ratio of the time spent in
resonance at ΩJ(max) to the time spent oﬀresonance at ΩJ is of order
t(max)
t
∼
s
1 −
Ω2
J
Ω2
J(max) ×
1
√
P
.
For a narrow resonance width this ratio can be very large so that amplitude window results for
ﬁxed value of d.
3. Amplitude window results if there is a correlation between the thickness of ME and transversal
electric ﬁeld so that ωJ(max) = ZeEd(E) satisﬁes resonance condition for some values of E
only, if any. In absence of this correlation Josephson junctions must have discrete spectrum of
eﬀective lengths for amplitude window to result.
4. For electric ﬁelds in the range .1 V/m the frequencies ωJ are above GHz for d larger than
3 × 10−5 meters and correspond to the frequencies for the conformational dynamics of proteins.
There are obviously a large number of frequencies of this kind and several intensity windows.
EM ﬁelds with these strengths should have special eﬀects on living matter: it could be even
that some kind of feature recognition process involving self-organization occurs at these ﬁeld
strengths. Note that the minimal size of Josephson junctions corresponds to the p-adic length
scale L(173) ≃1.6 × 10−5 meters characterizing structures next to cells in the p-adic length
scale hierarchy.
5. MEs and quantum holography
Sokolov and collaborators [B9] have proposed a model of quantum holographic teleportation in
which the classical photocurrents from the sender to receiver take the role of a dynamical hologram.
The connection with MEs is obvious.

5.3. Quantum tools for biocontrol and -coordination
269
1. MEs are carriers of classical lightlike vacuum currents (one of the basic diﬀerences between TGD
and Maxwell theory). This suggests that MEs could be interpreted also as classical holograms,
which are dynamical as in quantum information theory. Lightlike current would be like a dy-
namical (four-dimensional) diﬀraction grating. Lightlike vacuum currents and vacuum Einstein
tensor generate also coherent states of photons and gravitons and MEs serve as templates for the
topological condensation of photons and gravitons to the Bose-Einstein condensate of photons
collinear with ME. The Bose-Einstein condensation of collinear photons and their generaliza-
tions to colored conﬁguration space photons should aﬀect the vacuum current by adding to the
reference current what might be called evoked response. This condensation process could gen-
erate conscious experience and higher level qualia. Thus it would seem that MEs have a triple
role as receiving and sending quantum antennae as well as classical holograms.
2. The proposal of [B9] generalizes to the case of MEs provided one can device a method of coding
quantum states of photon ﬁeld to the vacuum currents. The high eﬃciency photodetector matrix
is in which each pixel gives rise to a photocurrent [B9] , is replaced with ME or set of parallel
MEs. The neural window hypothesis states that neuronal axons are accompanied by parallel
MEs carrying information between sensory organs and brain and various parts of brain. This
is only a less standard manner to say that ME represents classical dynamical hologram. The
possibility of local lightcone coordinates allows also MEs which deﬁne curved deformations of
the simplest cylindrical MEs.
The concrete realization of holographic teleportation proposed in [B9] brings strongly in mind
the architecture of the visual pathways. Thus one can wonder whether brain is perfoming in-
ternal teleportation of photonic quantum states with spike patterns being directly coded to the
pattern of the vacuum currents ﬂowing along MEs. If spike patterns code the dynamical holo-
gram, a surprisingly close relationship with Pribram’s views about hologrammic brain results.
Nerve pulse patterns could be seen as specifying the necessary classical aspects of the quantum
teleportation (in TGD classical physics is essential part of quantum physics, rather than some
eﬀective theory).
3. The lightlike vacuum current at a 3-dimensional timelike section of ME as a function function
of time deﬁnes a dynamical 3-dimensional hologram. This is consistent with the fact that our
visual experience is two-dimensional: the information is always about outer boundaries of the
objects of the perceptive ﬁeld. The values of the vacuum current at a given point are non-
deterministic which means that vacuum current is ideal for coding information. Classical data
also propagate without dispersion with light velocity obeying the laws of geometric optics and
MEs imply channelling so that MEs are taylor-made for classical information transfer.
4. Space-time sheets can have both positive and negative time orientations and the sign of energy
depends on time orientation in TGD framework. This means that classical communication can
occur both in the direction of the geometric future and past: this is essential for the classical
model of the long term memories as a question commmunicated to the geometric past followed
by answe. The dynamical nature of the holograms means that there is no need to combine 2- or
3-dimensional holograms associated with several moments of geometric time to single hologram.
To remember is to perceive an object located in the geometric past. Of course, fractality might
make possible temporally scaled down versions of the geometric past but the principle would
remain the same.
5. Quantum hologram view suggests that the super-symplectic representations at the lightlike
boundaries of MEs characterized by gigantic almost-degeneracies are the real carriers of biological
information. According to the general theory of qualia [K28] this information would become
conscious since elementary qualia would correspond to quantum jumps for which increments of
the quantum numbers correspond to the quantum numbers labelling super-symplectic generators
in the complement of Cartan algebra. In this view superconducting magnetic ﬂux tubes could
perhaps be seen as intermediate level in the control circuitry controlled by MEs and controlling
atomic level.
6. The model for visual qualia leads to the hypothesis that, besides ordinary photons, also colored
conﬁguration space photons are possible and characterized by conﬁguration space Hamiltonian

270
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
which is labelled by orbital spin quantum number J (in two-dimensional sense) and by color
quantum numbers. The coherent states of these massless conﬁguration space photons would be
responsible for visual colors and polarization sense and the corresponding holograms might be
the crux of quantum control in living matter.
Magnetic ﬂux tubes and the notion of magnetic body
The notion of magnetic/ﬁeld body is one of the features of TGD inspired biology challengin the
standard views about living matter.
1. Magnetic body has a fractal onion like structure with decreasing magnetic ﬁeld strengths and
the highest layers can have astrophysical sizes. Cyclotron wave length gives an estimate for the
size of particular layer of magnetic body. B = .2 Gauss is the ﬁeld strength associated with a
particular layer of the magnetic body assignable to vertebrates and EEG. This value is not the
same as the nominal value of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld equal to .5 Gauss. It is quite possible
that the ﬂux quanta of the magnetic body correspond to those of wormhole magnetic ﬁeld and
thus consist of two parallel ﬂux quanta which have opposite time orientation. This is true for
ﬂux tubes assigned to DNA in the model of DNA as a topological quantum computer.
2. The layers of the magnetic body are characterized by the values of Planck constant and the
matter at the ﬂux quanta can be interpreted as macroscopically quantum coherent dark matter.
This picture makes sense only if one accepts the generalization of the notion of imbedding space.
3. In the case of wormhole magnetic ﬁelds it is natural to assign a deﬁnite temporal duration to
the ﬂux quanta and the time scales deﬁned by EEG frequencies are natural. In particular, the
inherent time scale .1 seconds assignable to electron as a duration of zero energy space-time sheet
having positive and negative energy electron at its ends would correspond to 10 Hz cyclotron
frequency for ordinary value of Planck constant. For larger values of Planck constants the time
scale scales as ℏ. Quite generally, a connection between p-adic time scales of EEG and those of
electron and lightest quarks is highly suggestive since light quarks play key role in the model of
DNA as topological quantum computer.
4. TGD predicts also hierarchy of scaled variants of electro-weak and color physics so that ZXG,
QXG, and GXG corresponding to Z0 boson, W boson, and gluons appearing eﬀectively as
massless particles below some biologically relevant length scale suggest themselves. In this phase
quarks and gluons are unconﬁned and electroweak symmetries are unbroken so that gluons, weak
bosons, quarks and even neutrinos might be relevant to the understanding of living matter. In
particular, long ranged entanglement in charge and color degrees of freedom becomes possible.
For instance, TGD based model of atomic nucleus as nuclear string suggests that biologically
important fermionic could be actually chemically equivalent bosons and form cyclotron Bose-
Einstein condensates.
The list of possible functions of the magnetic body is rather impressive.
1. Magnetic body controls biological body and receives sensory data from it. Together with zero
energy ontology and new view about time explains Libet’s strange ﬁndings about time lapses
of consciousness. EEG, or actually fractal hierarchy of EXGs assignable to various body parts
makes possible communications to and control by the various layers of the magnetic body. WXG
could induce charge density gradients by the exchange of W boson.
2. The ﬂux sheets of the magnetic body traverse through DNA strands. The hierarchy of Planck
constants and quantization of magnetic ﬂux predicts that the ﬂux sheets can have arbitrarily
large width. This leads to the idea that there is hierarchy of genomes corresponding to ordinary
genome, supergenome consisting of genomes of several cell nuclei arranged along ﬂux sheet like
lines of text, and hypergenomes involving genomes of several organisms arranged in a similar
manner. The prediction is coherent gene expression at the level of organ, and even of population.
In this picture the big jumps in evolution, in particular, the emergence of EEG, could be seen as
the emergence of a new larger layer of magnetic body characterized by a larger value of Planck
constant. For instance, this would allow to understand why the quantal eﬀects of ELF em ﬁelds

5.3. Quantum tools for biocontrol and -coordination
271
requiring so large value of Planck constant that cyclotron energies are above thermal energy at
body temperature are observed for vertebrates only.
3. The strands of DNA could serve as intermediary structure analogous to brain hemispheres with
active strand analogous to motor areas and passive strand analogous to sensory areas of cortex.
The passive strand would serve as a relay station through which sensory data about the cellular
environment is transferred to the magnetic body. Here MEs topologically condensed to the ﬂux
sheets could be in key role. The ﬂux tubes connecting DNA nucleotides and cell membrane and
various biomolecules would mediate the sensory data to the passive DNA strand.
4. Magnetic body makes possible information process in a manner highly analogous to topological
quantum computation. The model of DNA as topological quantum computer assumes that ﬂux
tubes of wormhole magnetic ﬁeld connect DNA nucleotides with the lipids of the lipid layer
of nuclear or cell membrane. The ﬂux tubes would continue through the membrane and split
during topological quantum computation. The time-like braiding of ﬂux tubes makes possible
topological quantum computation via timelike braiding and space-like braiding makes possible
the representation of memories. The model allows general vision about the deeper meaning of
the structure of cell and makes testable predictions about DNA.
One prediction is the coloring of braid strands realized by an association of quark or antiquark
to nucleotide. Color and spin of quarks and antiquarks would thus correspond to the quantum
numbers assignable to braid ends. Color isospin could replace ordinary spin as a representation of
qubit and quarks would naturally give rise to qutrit, with third quark would have interpretation
as unspeciﬁed truth value. Fractionization of these quantum numbers takes place which increases
the number of degrees of freedom.
This prediction would relate closely to the discovery of
topologist Barbara Shipman that the model for the honeybee dance suggests that quarks are
in some manner involved with cognition. Also microtubules associated with axons connected
to a space-time sheet outside axonal membrane via lipids could be involved with topological
quantum computation and actually deﬁne an analog of a higher level programming language.
5. The strange ﬁndings about the behavior of cell membrane, in particular the ﬁnding that metabolic
deprivation does not lead to the death of cell, the discovery that ionic currents through the cell
membrane are quantal, and that these currents are essentially similar than those through an
artiﬁcial membrane, suggest that the ionic currents are dark ionic Josephson currents along mag-
netic ﬂux tubes. A high percent of biological ions would be dark and ionic channels and pumps
would be responsible only for the control of the ﬂow of ordinary ions through cell membrane.
6. These ﬁndings together with the discovery that also nerve pulse seems to involve only low
dissipation lead to a model of nerve pulse in which dark ionic currents automatically return
back as Josephson currents without any need for pumping. This does not exclude the possibility
that ionic channels might be involved with the generation of nerve pulse so that the original view
about quantal currents as controllers of the generation of nerve pulse would be turned upside
down.
Nerve pulse would result as a perturbation of kHz soliton sequence mathematically
equivalent to a situation in which a sequence of gravitational penduli rotates with constant
phase diﬀerence between neighbors except for one pendulum which oscillates and oscillation
moves along the sequence with the same velocity as the kHz wave. The oscillation would be
induced by a ”kick” for which one can imagine several mechanisms.
The model explains features of nerve pulse not explained by Hodkin-Huxley model.
These
include the mechanical changes associated with axon during nerve pulse, the outwards force
generated by nerve pulse with a correct prediction for its order of magnitude, the adiabatic
character of nerve pulse, and the small rise of temperature of membrane during pulse followed
by a reduction slightly below the original temperature.
The model predicts that the time taken to travel along any axon is a multiple of time dictated
by the resting potential so that synchronization is an automatic prediction. Not only kHz waves
but also a fractal hierarchy of EEG (and EXG) waves are induced as Josephson radiation by
voltage waves along axons and microtubules and by standing waves assignable to neuronal (cell)
soma. The value of Planck constant involved with ﬂux tubes determines the frequency scale of
EXG so that a fractal hierarchy results.

272
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
The model forces to challenge the existing interpretation of nerve pulse patterns and the function
of neural transmitters. Neural transmitters need not represent actual/only) signal but could be
more analogous to links in quantum web. The transmitter would coding the address of the
receiver, which could be gene inside neuronal nucleus. Nerve pulses would build a connection
line between sender and receiver of nerve pulse along which actual signals would propagate. Also
quantum entanglement between receiver and sender can be considered.
7. Acupuncture points, meridians, and Chi are key notions of Eastern medicine and ﬁnd a natural
identiﬁcation in terms of magnetic body lacking from the western medicine. Also a connection
with well established notions of DC currents and potentials discovered by Becker and with TGD
based view about universal metabolic currencies as diﬀerences of zero point energies for pairs of
space-time sheets with diﬀerent p-adic length scale emerges.
Chi would correspond to these fundamental metabolic energy quanta to which ordinary chemi-
cally stored metabolic energy would be transformed. Meridians would most naturally correspond
to ﬂux tubes with large ℏalong which dark supra currents ﬂow without dissipation and transfer
the metabolic energy between distant cells. Acupuncture points would correspond to points
between which metabolic energy is transferred and their high conductivity and semiconductor
like behavior would conform with the interpretation in terms of metabolic energy storages. The
energy gained in the potential diﬀerence between the points would help to kick the charge carrier
to a smaller space-time sheet. It is possible that the main contribution to the of charge at mag-
netic ﬂux tube is magnetic energy and slightly below the metabolic energy quantum and that
the voltage diﬀerence gives only the lacking small energy increment making the transfer possible.
Also direct kicking of charge carriers to smaller space-time sheets by photons is possible and
the observed action spectrum for IR and red photons corresponds to the predicted increments
of zero point kinetic energies.
8. Magnetic ﬂux tubes could also play key role in bio-catalysis and explain the magic ability of
biomolecules to ﬁnd each other. The model of DNA as topological quantum computer [K23] sug-
gest that not only DNA and its conjugate but also some amino-acid sequences acting as catalysts
could be connected to DNA and other amino-acids sequences or more general biomolecules by
ﬂux tubes acting as colored braid strands. The shortening of the ﬂux tubes in a phase transition
reducing the value of Planck constant would make possible extremely selective mechanisms of
catalysis allowing precisely deﬁned locations of reacting molecules to attach to each other. With
recently discovered mechanism for programming sequences of biochemical reactions this would
make possible to understand the miraculous looking feats of bio-catalysis.
9. The ability to construct ”stories”, temporally scaled down or possible also scaled up represen-
tations about the dynamical processes of external world, might be one of the key aspects of
intelligence. There is direct empirical evidence for this activity in hippocampus. The phase
transitions reducing or increasing the value of Planck constant would indeed allow to achieve
this by scaling the time duration of the zero energy space-time sheets providing cognitive repre-
sentations.
The list of nice things made possible by the magnetic body is impressive and one can ask whether
there is any experimental support for this notion. The ﬁndings of Peter Gariaev and collaborators
give evidence for the representation of DNA sequences based on the coding of nucleotide to a rotation
angle of the polarization direction as photon travels through the ﬂux tube and for the decoding of
this representation to gene activation [I17] , for the transformation of laser light to light at various
radio-wave frequencies having interpretation in terms of phase transitions increasing ℏ[I16, I1] , and
even for the possibility to photograph magnetic ﬂux tubes containing dark matter by using ordinary
light in UV-IR range scattered from DNA [K83] , [I30] .
Electrets
Electrets are by deﬁnition spontaneously electrically polarized structures. Living matter is full of
electrets. Practically all important biomolecules are electrets. Cell membrane is an electret and liquid
crystal. Microtubules are electrets as are also various larger structures such as collagens.

5.3. Quantum tools for biocontrol and -coordination
273
The dipolar nature of bio-molecules and induced polarization are basis prerequisites for the forma-
tion of gels. Ling raises the cohesion between water and protein molecules caused by electric dipole
forces as a fundamental principle and calls this principle association-induction hypothesis [I25] . This
cohesion gives rise to liquid [F2] [D2] like structure of water implying among other things layered struc-
tures and internal electric ﬁelds orthogonal to the plane of the layers [I21, I22, I25] . For instance, cell
membranes can be understood as resulting from the self-organization of liquid crystals [K12] . The
fundamental importance of electret nature of biomatter was also realized by Fr¨ohlich [I19] and led him
to suggest that macroscopic quantum phases of electric dipoles might be possible. This concept, which
is in central role in many theories of quantum consciousness, has not been established empirically.
In TGD framework electrets could serve as sensory receptors. In capacitor model of sensory qualia
the ﬂow of quantum numbers between the plates of this kind of capacitor would give rise to sensory
qualia. The process would be self-organization process with energy ﬂow replaced with a more general
ﬂow of quantum numbers.
5.3.2
Homeostasis as many-sheeted ionic ﬂow equilibrium?
The experimental work of Ling, Sachs and Qin [I25, I18] and other pioneers [I12, I39] challenges the
notions of ionic channels and pumps central to the standard cell biology. Ling has demonstrated that
the ionic concentrations of a metabolically deprived cell are not changed at all: this challenges the
notion of cell membrane ionic pumps. The work of Sachs and Qin and others based on patch-clamp
technique shows that the quantal ionic currents through cell membrane remain essentially as such
when the membrane is replaced by a silicon rubber membrane or by a cell membrane puriﬁed from
channel proteins!
this challenges the notion of cell membrane ionic channels.
A further puzzling
observation is much more mundane: ordinary hamburger contains roughly 80 per cent of water and
is thus like a wet sponge: why it is so diﬃcult to get the water out of it?
These puzzling observations can be understood if the homeostasis of cell and its exterior is regarded
as an ionic ﬂow equilibrium in the many-sheeted space-time. Ionic super currents from superconducting
controlling space-time sheets ﬂow to controlled atomic space-time sheets and back. Currents are of
course ohmic at the atomic space-time sheets. One can understand how extremely small ionic densities
and super currents at cellular space-time sheets can control ionic currents and much higher ionic
densities at atomic space-time sheets. Immense savings in metabolic energy are achieved if the ohmic
currents at the atomic space-time sheets ﬂow through the cell membrane region containing the strong
electric ﬁeld along superconducting cell membrane space-time sheet (rather than atomic space-time
sheets) as a non-dissipative supra current. This clever energy saving trick makes also the notion of
ionic channels obsolete for weak ionic currents at least.
Superconducting space-time sheets contain a plan of the biosystem coded to ion densities and
magnetic quantum numbers characterizing the super currents. Biocontrol by em ﬁelds aﬀects these
super currents and one can understand the eﬀects of ELF em ﬁelds on biosystem in this framework.
The model relies crucially on the liquid crystal property of biomatter (hamburger mystery!) making
possible ohmic current circuitry at the atomic space-time sheets as a part of the many-sheeted control
circuitry. There is a considerable evidence for this current circuitry, Becker is one of the pioneers in
the ﬁeld [J30] : among other things the circuitry could explain how acupuncture works.
One can add several new elements to this picture.
1. The phase transition changing the value of Planck constant induces a change of the length of the
magnetic ﬂux tube scaling as ℏ. Therefore the reduction of the Planck constant for a ﬂux tube
connecting two biomolecules can bring them near to each other. This suggests that biomolecules
form a kind of Indra’s net and that these phase transitions together with the reconnection of
magnetic ﬂux tubes changing the topology of this net are the basic mechanisms explaining
the miracles of bio-catalysis and induce various phases transitions typically accompanying con-
tractions and expansions of the matter in the cell interior. One could actually see the phase
transitions of living matter as being induced from the motor actions of the magnetic body.
2. Zero energy ontology predictis that the CDs assignable to elementary particles have temporal
size scale given by the secondary p-adic time scale. For electron and quarks (assigned to the
ends of magnetic ﬂux tubes in the model of topological quantum computation) these time scales
are 100 milliseconds and 1 millisecond respectively and identiﬁable as fundamental biological
time scales. A deep connection betweeen biology and elementary particle physics seems to exist.

274
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
3. Negentropic entanglement transforms the bio-molecules from dead matter to conscious enti-
ties so that the nano-scaled molecules are just what they seem to be in light of experimental
nano-biology: intelligent conscious entities having intentions and plans and willing and able to
collaborate.
5.3.3
Quantum model for pattern recognition
The general neuroscience based model for recognition relies one learning made possible by synaptic
plasticity.
It is expected to have a TGD based quantum variant [K70] .
The model of pattern
recognition to be discussed below relies on supra currents and Josephson currents assignable to cell
membrane and various other binary structures, and could deﬁne a building brick of the general model.
For instance, the model of nerve pulse relies on Josephson currents [K62] .
Time translation invariant pattern recognition circuit can be realized by using two coupled super
conductors. The ﬁrst superconductor contains the reference supra current and second superconductor
contains the supra current determined by the sensory input. Supra currents are assumed to have
same spatially and temporally constant intensity. If the supra currents have spatially constant phase
diﬀerence, also Josephson currents are in the same phase and sum up to a large current facilitating
synchronous ﬁring. The temporal phase diﬀerence of supra currents does not matter since it aﬀects
only the overall phase of the Josephson current. Therefore patterns diﬀering by time translations are
treated as equivalent. Quite generally, the requirement of time translational invariance, favours the
coding of the sensory qualia to transition frequencies.
The destructive interference of supra currents provides an tool of pattern cognition in situations
when the precise timing is important. The pattern to be recognized can be represented as a refer-
ence current pattern in some neuronal circuit. Input pattern determined by sensory input in turn is
represented by supra current interfering with the reference current. If the interference is destructive,
synchronoous generation of nerve pulses in the circuit occurs and leads to a conscious pattern recog-
nition. Obviously the loss of time translation invariance makes this mechanism undesirable in the
situations in which the precise timing of the sensory input does not matter. One can however imagine
situations when timing is important: for instance, the deduction of the direction of the object of the
auditory ﬁeld from the phase diﬀerence associated with signals entering into right and left ears could
correspond to this kind of situation.
In both cases one can worry about the regeneration of reference currents. The paradigm of four-
dimensional quantum brain suggests that sensory input leads by self-organization to a stationary
spatial patterns of supracurrents and this process depends only very mildly on initial values. Thus
self-organization would generate automatically pattern recognizers.
5.3.4
General mechanism making possible biological clocks and alarm clocks,
comparison circuits and novelty detectors
Weakly coupled super conductors and auantum self-organization make possible very general models
of biological clocks and alarm clocks as well as comparison circuits and novelty detectors.
The Josephson junction between two superconductors provides a manner to realize a biological
clock. Josephson current can be written in the form [D9]
J
=
J0sin(∆Φ) = J0sin(Ωt) ,
Ω
=
ZeV ,
(5.3.1)
where Ωis proportional to the potential diﬀerence over the Josephson junction. Josephson current
ﬂows without dissipation.
In BCS theory of superconductivity the value of the current J0 can be expressed in terms of
the energy gap ∆of the super conductor and the ordinary conductivity of the junction. When the
temperature is much smaller than critical temperature, the current density for a junction is given by
the expression [D9]
J0
=
π
2e
σs∆
d
.
(5.3.2)

5.3. Quantum tools for biocontrol and -coordination
275
Here σs is the conductivity of the junction in the normal state assuming that all conduction electrons
can become carriers of the supra current.
d is the distance between the super conductors.
The
current in turn implies a position independent(!) oscillation of the Cooper pair density inside the
two super conductors. By the previous arguments the density of the Cooper pairs is an ideal tool
of biocontrol and a rhytmic change in biological activity expected to result in general. Josephson
junctions are therefore good candidates for pacemakers not only in brain but also in heart and in
respiratory system.
In the presence of several parallel Josephson junctions quantum interference eﬀects become possible
if supra currents ﬂow in the super conductors. Supra current is proportional to the gradient of the
phase angle associated with the order parameter, so that the phase angle Φ is not same for the
Josephson junctions anymore and the total Josephson current reads as
J
=
X
n
J0(n)sin(Ωt + ∆Φ(n)) .
(5.3.3)
It is clear that destructive interference takes place. The degree of the destructive interference depends
on the magnitude of the supra currents and on the number of Josephson junctions.
There are several options depending on whether both super conductors carry parallel supra currents
or whether only second super conductor carries supra current.
1. If both super conductors carry supra currents of same magnitude but diﬀerent velocity, the
phases associated with the currents have diﬀerent spatial dependence and destructive interference
occurs unless the currents propagate with similar velocity.
This mechanism makes possible
comparison circuit serving as a feature detector. What is needed is to represent the feature
to be detected by a ﬁxed supra current in the second super conductor and the input as supra
current with same charge density but diﬀerence velocity. The problem is how the system is able
to generate and preserve the reference current. If case that feature detector ’wakes-up’ into self
state when feature detection occurs, the subsequent quantum self-organization should lead to
the generation of the reference current representing the feature to be detected.
2. If only second super conductor carries supra current and of this supra current for some reason
decreases or becomes zero, constructive interference occurs for individual Josephson currents and
net Josephson current increases: current causes large gradients of Cooper pair density and can
lead to the instability of the structure. When the supra current in the circuit dissipates below a
critical value, instability emerges. This provides a general mechanism of biological alarm clock.
Assume that the second super conductor carriers a supra current.
As the time passes the
reference current dissipates by phase slippages [D3, D9] . If the reference current is large enough,
the dissipation takes place with a constant rate. This in turn means that the Josephson current
increases in the course of time. When the amplitude of the Josephson current becomes large
enough, the density gradients of the charge carriers implied by it lead to a nonstability of the
controlled system: the clock rings.
Since the dissipation of (a suﬃciently large) Josephson
current takes place at constant rate this alarm clock can be quite accurate. It will be found that
a variant of this mechanism might be at work even in the replication of DNA. The unstability
itself can regenerate the reference current to the clock. If the alarm clock actually ’wakes-up’
the alarm clock to self state, self-organization by quantum jumps must lead to an asymptotic
self-organization pattern in which the supra current in the circuit is the original one. Actually
this should occur since asymptotic self-organization pattern depends only weakly on the initial
values.
3. Novelty detector can be build by feeding the outputs of the feature detectors to an alarm
clock circuit.
In alarm clock circuit only the second super conductor carries supra current,
which represents the sum of the outputs of the feature detectors. Since the output of a feature
detector is nonvanishing only provided the input corresponds to the feature to be detected, the
Josephson current in additional circuit becomes large only when the input does not correspond
to any familiar pattern.

276
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
5.4
Sensory representations
In this section concrete model for the sensory representations is developed on basis of the general
vision already outlined. What is new as compared to the earlier vision is the role of zero energy
ontology and CDs as imbedding space correlates for sub-selves.
5.4.1
Where me is?
The motion of eye or head does not induce the sensation that the world is moving although the
sensory image moves around the cortex. Rather, brain acts like a (possibly moving) canvas at which
the sensory input is projected and monitored by an external observer. This very simple observation is
a strong objection against the idea that the ultimate sensory representations reside inside brain, and
leads to the view that the magnetic ﬂux tube structures associated with the primary and secondary
sensory organs deﬁne a hierarchy of sensory representations outside brain. The question is where these
representations are realized and one can imagine two alternatives.
Are higher level sensory representations realized at the magnetic body?
Magnetic ﬂux tube structures would serve as the sensory canvas to which sensory images are projected
from brain and possibly sensory organs and even neurons. MEs serve as projectors and place coding
by magnetic transition frequency associated with ME wakes-up sensory subselves at various positions
of magnetic ﬂux tubes having varying thickness and associate thus various sensory qualia and even
more complex attributes to the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld.
This view can be defended also by the neat separation of the information processing from its
representation occurring also in case of the ordinary computers as well as by Uncertainty Principle for
EEG waves. If primary qualia are at the level of primary sensory organs and entangled with cortex,
one can understand why imagination, which involves much the same neural processes as perception,
does not give rise to sensory qualia.
EEG MEs correspond to our level in this hierarchy of projections. The simplest possibility is that
the sizes of these sensory selves are of the order of EEG ME sizes (L(EEG) = c/f(EEG)) and thus
can be of the order of Earth size! Thus the ultimate sensory representations are magnetic gigants in
TGD and diametrical opposites of the neurophysiological dwarfs of standard neuroscience populating
also TGD brain.
The known strange eﬀects of large scale perturbations of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld on consciousness
(say, statistics about the eﬀects of magnetic storms in mental state and tectonic activity inducing
UFO experiences) provide a rich palette of anomalies supporting this view.
The conservation of
magnetic ﬂux makes the magnetic ﬂux tube structures of Earth size (or even larger) very stable: thus
physical death presumably means only that our magnetic body redirects its attention to something
more interesting. Near death experiences discussed in more detail in [K12] indeed support this view.
Two requirements must be satisﬁed for this scenario to work.
1. The projectors to the magnetic body cannot rotate when head rotates so that a ﬁxed direction
of perceptive ﬁeld corresponds to the ﬁxed direct at the magnetic body. This can be achieved
if the projectors are magnetic structures with a ﬁxed orientation with respect to the Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld.
2. Retinae must act like windows for this scenario to work. This means that the primary qualia
mental images (subselves) at retina are entangled with the corresponding cognitive mental images
at cortex, keep their attention directed to that part of the perceptive ﬁeld that they represent as
the direction of the gaze changes. Perhaps the retinal mental images are stationary with respect
to the liquid phase not comoving with the eye ball. The retina-external world entanglement
would also keep retinal attention ﬁxed. This applies also to the saccadic motion, and the loss of
visual consciousness when saccadic motion is prevented, could mean simply that retinal mental
images lose consciousness when their motor activity with respect to eye ball is prevented: just
like we lose our consciousness if not allowed to move!

5.4. Sensory representations
277
Could the sensory representations about position of the object be realized in the per-
ceptive ﬁeld?
There is also a more conservative realization of sensory representations (if I had invented it ﬁrst, I
would probably have never considered the representations at the magnetic body!).
1. If retina-external world entanglement is present as suggested by the argument above, sensory
canvas for the primary sensory representations could be provided by the perceptive ﬁeld itself.
The series of quantum entanglements from sensory organs to brain to magnetic body would
deﬁne the entire sensory-cognitive representation involving also the cognitive aspects. There
would be no absolute need for topographic representations at the magnetic body although the
appearance of a hierarchy of topographic representations in brain suggest that topographic
representations continues. The magnetic representations could however be more abstract higher
level representations: somewhat like the manual of an electronic instrument as compared with
the photograph of the instrument.
2. One can also imagine that the magnetic body is not involved at all since also in this case the
sensory representation would be organized topographically by the entanglement with the objects
of the perceptive ﬁeld. Now brain would entangle to the objects of the external world cognitive
mental images. One could say, that me is the entire perceptive ﬁeld plus physical body. In this
case however the function of EEG remains unclear. Also the model of long term memories also
suggests that EEG MEs in length scales of light life-time are involved.
Of course, neither of these views about human consciousness is new. In particular, the ﬁrst one
is shared by all spiritual practices. What is new is the concrete physical model realizing this view
physically. Here I cannot avoid the temptation to fall for a moment in manifesto mood: what makes
me sad is that the materialistic neuroscience so strongly advocates the brain centered view about
consciousness with physical death meaning the absolute end. The belief in this world view deprives
life from its meaning and reduces it to a vulgar ﬁght for survival or, depending on one’s tastes, to
a pre-determined performance of a robot. It is also deeply frustrating that the stubborn belief on
materialism prevails despite the fact that this dogma contains so many internal contradictions that it
would not even deserve to be called world view.
5.4.2
Concrete realization of sensory representations
The vision about the concrete realization of the sensory representations conscious-to-us has developed
rather slowly. A good measure for the uncertainties involved is that the sizes of the primary sensory
organs and EEG ME lengths L(EEG) = c/f have represented the two extreme options for the size
scale of the sensory representations conscious-to-us.
It seems however more and more clear that
TGD forces a dramatic deviation from the prevailing view about cortex as the seat of the ultimate
sensory representations. The sensory representations conscious-to-us are outside the body and that
the relevant length scale could be most naturally the length scale L(EEG) = c/f deﬁned by the EEG
frequencies. In case of long term memories much longer length scales in the range of the light lifetime
are necessarily involved and the realization of long term memories forces to conclude that human
sensory consciousness is a cosmic phenomenon.
Qualia as quantum phase transitions and as discharges of quantum capacitor
In TGD framework the meaning of the primary quale is associated with the mental images created by
the self-organization process. If the quale corresponds to an average increment of quantum numbers
or zero modes in a long quantum jump sequence, the quantum jump with same increment must occur
repeatedly. One can imagine at least two mechanism inducing qualia.
1. Quantum phase transition produce qualia
Quantum phase transition in which single particle transition occurs coherently for some macro-
scopic quantum phase produces qualia deﬁned by the increments of quantum numbers in the transition.
Quantum phase transition could be induced by the transition frequency: quantum phase transition
leading to the generation of new kind of macroscopic quantum phase is in question. Transition frequen-
cies themselves as such serve as symbols initiating this process, much like sub-program call initiates

subprogram. They act like the name of dog: when dog hears its own name, dramatic self-organization
process is initiated.
2. Discharge of quantum capacitor produces primary qualia
Quantum capacitor discharge provides an attractive model for how the primary sensory qualia at
the level of sensory receptors emerge.
The ﬂow of particles with ﬁxed quantum numbers between ”electrodes” of what might be called
a quantum capacitor induces qualia deﬁned by the quantum numbers of the particles involved. The
”electrodes” carry opposite net quantum numbers. Second electrode corresponds to the sub-self deﬁn-
ing the quale mental image.
Obviously cell interior and exterior are excellent candidates for the
electrodes of the quantum capacitor. Also neuron and postsynaptic neuron. In fact, living matter
is full of electrets deﬁning capacitor like structures. The model of sensory receptor as a quantum
capacitor will be discussed later. The model applies to various chemical qualia and also to color vision
and predicts that also cells should have senses. Ordinary cells would sense only the nearby chemical
environment whereas neurons would experience via synapses also representations of external world
chemically: at our level of conscious experience these representations could give rise to emotions. The
strange behavior of ionic currents leads to the view that even ionic channels and pumps are actually
ionic and voltage receptors.
3. Higher level qualia at the level of brain and magnetic body
Higher level sensory qualia at the level of magnetic body are expected to relate to the geometric
aspects of sensory input such as shape or size of objects of the perceptive ﬁeld.
The capacitor model in principle generalizes to the level of brain and magnetic body.
What
is needed is a phase transition transforming one Bose-Einstein condensate type phase with deﬁnite
quantum numbers to a second one. Music metaphor suggests that only the ratios of transition fre-
quency to, say, cyclotron frequency can code for qualia. Only the ratios of Larmor and cyclotron
frequencies and frequencies characterizing CDs and the intensities of the Fourier components for var-
ious harmonics can aﬀect self-organization process. Furthermore, quale together with its emotional
aspects depend on a simultaneous occurrence of several quantum phase transitions induced by the
EEG pattern containing several magnetic transition frequencies. Diﬀerent values of Planck constant
could deﬁne a hierarchy of epresentations.
Zero energy ontology and geometric qualia
Zero energy ontology is a new element of quantum TGD and states that all physical states have
vanishing net values of conserved quantum numbers. Zero energy ontology provides a ﬁrm justiﬁcation
for the notion of negative energy signals consisting of (say) phase conjugate photons propagating to
the geometric past. These negative energy signals are crucial element of the time mirror mechanism
playing a central role in the general mechanism for intentional action, remote metabolism, and long
term memory.
Causal diamond (CD) deﬁned roughly as the intersection of future and past directed lightcones
serves as an imbedding space correlate for zero energy state. Space-time sheets representing zero
energy states are inside CD and the future resp. past boundaries of CD carry positive resp. negative
energy parts of zero energy states. What is important from the point of view of consciousness theory
is that CDs serve as imbedding space correlates of selves and sub-CDs as those for sub-selves (mental
images). Sub-CDs are very much analogous to music instruments in the sense that the frequencies
which come as harmonics of the fundamental frequency deﬁned by the proper time distance between
tips of CD (coming as powers of two) resonate with the geometry of CD and put it to ”ring”. Sub-
CDs could be seen as an analog of radio receiver as far as sensory representations are considered and
sending antenna as far as the motor control of biological body is involved. This allows to communicate
sensory data from brain to sub-CDs at magnetic body CD in a highly selective manner. MEs (massless
extremals) mediating the communications between magnetic body and biological body are also very
much like strings of a music instrument. This picture generalize the earlier music metaphor applied
to axonal pathways.
A more precise deﬁnition of CD is as the Cartesian product of the intersection of future and past
directed light-cone with CP2. The hierarchy of Planck constants brings in additional structure. There
is identiﬁcation of preferred M 2 ⊂M 4 deﬁning a preferred time direction (rest system/quantization

5.4. Sensory representations
279
axis for energy) and spin quantization axis. The preferred geodesically trivial sphere S2 ⊂CP2 and
the selection of point assigned with CP2 at the future and past boundaries of CD gives rise to a
selection of quantization axes of color isospin and hyper charge.
Sensory representations are a key element of the consciousness theory and the moduli space of
CDs charactering what kind of CDs are possible brings in new representational resources.
1. The moduli space of sub-CDs involves the position for the either tip of the sub-CD and the
naive expectation is that this position could code for the position of the perceptive ﬁeld. If so
the representation would be very concrete and since the size of CD is already for electron with
.1 lightseconds the representations is realized automatically in astrophysical scale.
2. The moduli space of sub-CDs assignable to the mental images with another tip ﬁxed could
represent geometric qualia. Without any further restrictions this space corresponds to proper
time constant hyperboloid of future light cone. The values of time parameter come in powers
of two. One can however quite well consider the possibility that only a discrete lattice of the
hyperboloid is realized.
3. A Lorentz boost for sub-CD induces scaling of frequency and scaling of the object in the direction
of the boost. Therefore boost coded to the fundamental frequency of CD could code for various
shapes of a ﬁgure obtained by scaling. Boost of sub−CD leaving the other tip of sub−CD
invariant could also code for the velocity of object.
4. The moduli space of CDs contains also the choice of quantization axes of energy (preferred
rest system) and spin as well as the choice of quantization axes of color isospin and hyper-
charge identiﬁable as ﬂag manifold SU(3)/U(1) × U(1). Mathematician Barbara Shipman has
proposed that this ﬂag manifold is involved with the representation of geometric data in honeybee
dance [A21] and I have proposed a model for what might be involved [K28] .
The moduli space of CDs is thus highly relevant for the representation of the geometric data
associated with the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld and the this data would be communicated using
MEs with harmonics of the fundamental frequency of sub-CD so that sub-CD would act like radio
receiver. This includes the position of the real object codable to the position of sub-CDs at magnetic
body, the velocity of the object of the perceptive ﬁeld codable to the Lorentz boost changing the
shape of sub-CD and represented as scaling of the frequency assigned with the stationary object.
Also the shape of perceptive ﬁeld would represent this kind of geometric data. This picture supports
the interpretation of sub-CDs as spotlights of attention giving information about many-sheeted space-
time inside the regions deﬁned by the sub-CDs. It would seem that sub-CDs are dynamical objects
created, destroyed, and shifted in quantum jumps. This picture is also consistent with the explanation
for the arrow of psychological time based on zero energy ontology [K86] .
Place coding by cyclotron frequency scale
One of the basic aspects of conscious information processing is concrete geometric representation of
even very abstract concepts and information as imagined objects of perceptive ﬁeld. The observations
about geometric qualia suggest to magnetic transition frequencies code for positions of subselves
represented by magnetic ﬂux tubes. Particular EEG frequency wakes-up particular subself in a speciﬁc
position and orientation and gives rise to a ’feeling of existence’ in some part of the virtual world of
brain of magnetic body. The sensation of motion of object of perceptive ﬁeld cold result automatically
when subself moves inside self.
Alternatively, Lorentz boost for the sub-CD could represent the
velocity of motion of object represented by it. For instance, one could represent coordinate curves
as magnetic ﬂux tubes with varying thickness: by magnetic ﬂux conservation thickness codes the
coordinate to magnetic ﬁeld strength to cyclotron frequency.
Cortex as a collection of attributes assigned to the objects of perceptive ﬁeld represented
at magnetic canvas
One of the basic problems related to the understanding of the information processing in brain is
how various attributes are assigned to the object of the perceptive ﬁeld. What is known that brain
recognizes features and these features/attributes seem to be located in a more or less random looking

280
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
manner all around cortex. This brings strongly in mind random access memory or computer game in
which various little program modules realized as records in random access memory represent collection
of standard sound eﬀects. A strong hint is the empirical evidence for the view that the resonance
frequencies associated with the autocorrelation functions of nerve pulse patterns, and thus presumably
also coding EEG frequencies, are same for the features associated with a given object of the perceptive
ﬁeld. The challenge is to understand how the picture based on a collection of MEs projecting features
to the magnetic canvas could allow to understand what is behind these observations.
The view about MEs associating attributes to the object of the perceptive ﬁeld by waking up sub-
selves in the magnetic ﬂux tube structure serving as a sensory canvas suggests an elegant interpretation
for these facts.
1. Cortex can be regarded as a collection of regions specialized to represent various kinds of standard
features. Features need not be simple qualia: arbitrary complicated collections of them, such as
familiar faces are also possible features. Even entire dynamical processes (selves) could serve as
features.
2. Basic feature-regions are like computer records. The information about the position of the fea-
ture in perceptive ﬁeld could be represented by the entanglement of the feature with a particular
part of, say, primary sensory area representing a point of the perceptive sphere.
3. The direction of the point of the perceptive ﬁeld could be coded basically by the direction of the
magnetic ﬂux tube emerging from the particular position of the sensory area providing map for
solid angles of the perceptive ﬁeld. The mechanism would be based on resonance with Alfven
waves associated with the magnetic ﬂux tubes of personal magnetic body amplifying MEs in the
direction of magnetic ﬂux tubes. The length (fundamental frequency) of ME would code for the
distance of the point of the perceptive ﬁeld to the distance of the point of the sensory magnetic
canvas. Frequency coding could be achieved by varying the local value of the magnetic ﬁeld
responsible for generating the cyclotron frequency. This coding could be either dynamical or
static in which case distance could be most naturally coded to linear structures, most naturally
in direction orthogonal to the cortical surface.
4. Features would be basically associated with sensory organs, various neural pathways and brain
areas and coded partially by nerve pulse patterns. Features could be practically all kinds of
subselves generated by brain activity. Primary qualia could be realized at the level of sensory
receptors if entire sensory pathways entangle with the magnetic body.
5. Projector MEs would be orthogonal to the sensory area where they emanate. The topographic
mapping of the perceptive ﬁeld to sensory areas would guarantee that sensory images would
remain stationary under rotations of head: although sensory magnetic sensory canvas would
move the image projected to it would be stationary. MEs and magnetic ﬂux tubes must be
parallel if Alfwen wave resonance is involved. In this manner the sensory experiences can be
private and the contribution from the other brains remains negligible. Note however that people
in very intimate contact could gradually share there magnetic sensory canvases: the anecdotes
about gradually developing telepathic communications between the teachers and students of the
meditative practices could involve this kind of sharing of computer screen between several users.
6. In this coding EEG MES would entangle with essentially all information about the perceptive
ﬁeld and the spectroscopy of consciousness to be discussed below would be realized in rather
strong sense.
7. The model becomes even more predictive if it is assumed that DNA double strands act as a relay
station. This encourages to think that also the decomposition of brain to motor and sensory areas
has a counterpart at the level of the magnetic body so that the sensory input coming from the
cell membrane is mediated through ﬂux sheets going through the passive strand to the sensory
magnetic body and motor actions of the motor magnetic body are mediated through theﬂux
sheets going through active strand. One would have a closed loop in which the phase transition
induced by the sensory input coming via the passive DNA strand to the sensory magnetic body
generates cyclotron radiation inducing a phase transition in the motor part inducing cyclotron
radiating inducing eﬀect in the active DNA strand.

5.4. Sensory representations
281
Of course, the extreme ﬂexibility of the entanglement mechanism of binding means that one can
imagine almost unlimited number of variants about this basic option and the proposed variant can
be defended only as the simplest one found hitherto. One can also allow the possibility that the
sequence of entanglements begins from the perceptive ﬁeld with the primary mental images at the
level of sensory organs being entangled with objects of perceptive ﬁeld.
Fractality suggests that there is a hierarchy of sensory representations. In particular, cortex areas,
brain nuclei and even cells could possess their own sensory representations. The inactivity of the
primary sensory areas during REM sleep could mean that during dream state sensory representations
are non-cortical lower level representations or realized at higher sensory areas.
Of course, lower
level structures could deﬁne the projections to the magnetic sensory canvas also during wake-up
consciousness. For instance, relay station like nuclei could act as relay stations for the projections
realized at the magnetic body. Any brain area deﬁning topographical map of sensory data is could
candidate for deﬁning a sensory representation.
The projector regions would serve as kind of central entanglers. Also the nuclei believed to somehow
generate EEG resonance frequencies responsible for the binding of mental images are good candidates
for the central entanglers. In standard neuroscience thalamus is believed to generate 40 Hz rhytm and is
thus a good candidate for the central sensory entangler and projector. In TGD framework this rhythm
would be more naturally generated by the magnetic body assignable to thalamus. Hippocampus -or
more naturally its magnetic body- generates hippocampal theta and could be the central memory
entangler and projector. Frontal lobes generate slow EEG waves during cognitive activities and could
act as cognitive entanglers and projectors.
This kind of architecture is expected to be realized at various length scales. The metaphor for
consciousness as a computer sitting at its own terminal, which originally stimulated my attempts to
understand consciousness, conforms this picture. Computer screen would correspond to the sensory
magnetic body.
The one who sits there presumably could be identiﬁed as the motor part of the
magnetic body (as far as conscious-to-me intentions are considered). The central unit corresponds
to the brain and DNA double strands are the fundamental hardware responsible for communication
and control and through which all information ﬂows. They intronic parts of DNA strands would
also provide the hardware for topological quantum computation programs. Sensory projector MEs
are generated automatically by the nerve pulse activity and code the picture at the monitor. MEs
would be active quantum holograms acting as control commands on the active DNA strand serving
as the keyboard generating nerve pulse patterns.
Thus it would seem that those aspects of the
computer (monitor, keyboard, etc), which are usually not regarded as fundamental in Turing machine
paradigm are the most crucial for understanding the consciousness and computer programmers could
be mimicking what happens inside (and outside) their own brain.
Anomalous visual percepts and sensory canvas hypothesis
Sensory canvas hypothesis means that at the perceptual level we see using ELF– rather than visible
light. Of course, if primary sensory qualia are at the level of sensory receptors, this seeing has the
character of imagination. Even in this case brain could use feedback to the sensory receptors assign
sensory qualia with the imagination like perception. This would occur during dreaming and what is
regarded as hallucinations.
One can also consider the possibility of ”vision” based solely on the ELF input from brain and
body having no correlate with the visible light entering into retina or even with neural activity. Even
genuinely three-dimensional vision in which own body is seen as it would be seen by the external world
suggests itself. The dropping of ions from the atomic space-time sheets to the magnetic ﬂux tubes so
that they end up to high n cyclotron states decaying via the emission of photons at frequencies which
are harmonics of the cyclotron frequency would generate the projector MEs needed for the sensory
representation of the physical body or part of it as seen by the environment.
There is some evidence for this kind of anomalous vision.
1. Yogis have reported altered states of consciousness in which they see their own body three-
dimensionally, that is simultaneously from all directions. This might have interpretation as ELF
vision involving a feedback from magnetic sensory canvas to brain to ”qualiafy” the percept.
2. Becker tells in his book ”Cross currents” [J29] about a young cancer patient who told that he
can see the interior of his own body. The patient could also locate the remnant of the tumour

282
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
correctly. If sensory receptors are necessary for visual qualia, the needed data must be received
from somewhere by brain, and be projected to the visual receptors like during dreaming. The
simplest option is that body parts can in some sense ”see” each other. In particular, brain can
”see” body parts (note that bacteria possess a primitive IR vision based on microtubules). Bio-
holography provides support for the body as a hologram. For instance, an electric stimulation
of ear during Kirlian imaging of a ﬁnger tip creates a Kirlian photo from which it is possible to
abstract a hologram of ear (see [I20] and [K34] .
3. Also the OBE experiences, for instance those associated with NDEs, could have an analogous
interpretation. The sensory input from eyes would be absent but brain would give feedback
to visual receptors to ”qualiafy” the the input which it might receive from other levels of self
hierarchy.
If even the input from neural activity is absent during NDEs so that the visual
experience should be determined by the background ELF component emanating from the brain
and body. The third person perspective associated with OBEs might be always present but
be masked by the strong sensory input or by the absence of feedback to visual receptors. It
is possible to have experiences about contact with deceased by a therapy based on rhythmic
eye movements [J40, J119]. The function of eye movements might be to establish a feedback
to certain brain regions serving as receivers of input from magnetic bodies of deceased or from
magnetosphere.
4. I have proposed thousand and one explanations for the beautiful ﬂow visible when I close my eyes
in a calm state of mind. During my ”great experience” this background ﬂow was accompanied
by extremely vivid visual hallucinations. An additional item to the long list of explanations
is following.
The information characterizing the ﬂow enters from or via brain to the visual
receptors and is in this manner ”qualiaﬁed”.
What has been said about magnetospheric third person aspect applies also to other senses. In-
terestingly, I often wake-up partially and realize that I hear my own snoring as an outsider (quite a
dramatic experience!). Sometimes I have an experience which might be interpreted by saying that the
hearing in the ﬁrst perspective is superposed with the hearing in the third person perspective. The
third person hearing has a time lag so that a kind of double breathing results.
Place coding of features inside brain
Place coding for various geometric parameters characterizing simple geometric ’features’ inside brain
could be realized using the variation of the cyclotron frequency along a magnetic ﬂux tube of varying
thickness. The hierarchy of the sensory canvases allows a modular structure in which a geometric
feature such as triangle, line, or ellipse represented at a lower level sensory canvas is projected to a
single point of ’our’ sensory canvas.
Becker tells in his book ”Cross Currents” [J29] about a technique discovered by Dr. Elizabeth
Rauscher, a physicist, and William Van Bise, an engineer. The technique uses magnetic ﬁelds gen-
erated by two coils of wire, each oscillating at a slightly diﬀerent frequency and directed so as to
intersect at the the head of the subject person. When two energy beams with diﬀerent frequencies
intersect at some point in space, a third frequency, so called beat frequency is formed as the diﬀerence
of the frequencies. What Bise and Rauscher found that this ELF frequency (unfortunately, I do not
know what the precise frequency range was) generates simple visual percepts like circles, ellipses and
triangles and that the variation of the second frequency induces the variation of the shape of the
percept.
The simplest interpretation is that the beat frequency is extracted by nonlinear eﬀects in brain and
induces a magnetic quantum phase transition at magnetic tubes whose thickness varies and codes for
a parameter (say scaling in some direction) characterizing the geometry of the primitive percept (or
’feature’). An analogous phenomenon occurs also for auditory inputs with slightly diﬀerent frequencies
fed into ears and makes it possible to ’hear’ sounds below the audible range. The mechanism could
be the same.
If primary sensory qualia are realized only at the level of the primary sensory organs, one can make
two conclusions. ELF wave wakes up a ”feature” analogous to an imagined percept, and presumably
realized as a particular nerve pulse pattern. ELF wave also induces a projection from the brain to

5.4. Sensory representations
283
the retinae ”qualiafying” this feature. Blind subjects should not have these extra-sensorily induced
percepts.
One can imagine two options concerning the ultimate representation of a simple geometric feature
depending on whether the feature corresponds to a collection of points or single point at ’our’ sensory
canvas.
1. The visual percept corresponds to a collection of activated points at ’our’ sensory canvas and
activated geometric point corresponds to a standard mental image represented at brain level and
assigned to a point of sensory canvas. The magnetic phase transition would initiate a process
eventually activating particular projectors and the position of the quantum phase transition at
the magnetic ﬂux tube would determine the shape of the feature. One can criticize this option.
The brain applies modular hierarchy in the information processing and simple percepts like
triangles and circles which are also fundamental in the elementary geometry, are ideal for basic
features assignable with a single point of ’our’ sensory canvas rather than being represented as
composites of elementary features (points). The very fact that the place coding for the geometric
shape of the feature is involved, suggests the same.
2. The visual percept is represented as a mental image inside brain or, more probably, at some
lower level sensory canvas so that the hierarchy of the sensory canvases would directly relate
to the modularity of our sensory representations and sensory canvases would be in an intense
interaction by quantum entanglement much like various subprograms of a computer program.
This geometric mental image is assigned with a single point of ’our’ sensory canvas by quantum
entangling it with a projector ME projecting to a particular point of ’our’ sensory canvas. The
position of the feature at the sensory canvas might be determined by the position of the volume
of intersection for the beams.
Since sinmple objects are in question and the change of the shape corresponds to a scaling in one
direction, the representation of the change of shape of the object could be in terms of a Lorentz boost
of sub-CD representing the object and leaving the tip of the sub-CD invariant.
The relation of mental imagery to sensory experiences
Mental imagery is something which is diﬃcult to understand in the framework of the standard neuro
science. There are empirical results suggesting that mental images correspond to patterns of activity
inside cortex, which are three-dimensional and continuous so that neural activation provides a concrete
recognizable image about object [J105] . Rather remarkably, also imaginative thought resembles very
much visual imagery as is clear from the fact that language is full of visual metaphors [J105] . It is
also known that imagery uses same regions of the cortex as real sensory experience and the problem
is to understand why there is almost sensory experience involved with imagery.
In the framework of the standard neuroscience the obvious question is why the pattern of the
imagery activity is not accompanied by a direct sensory experience. Also the boundary between direct
sensory experience and imagination is sometimes problematic. For instance, in the state between sleep
and awake sensory images often enter into mind. During dreams one can have sensory images and
eidetic memory is essentially sensory memory. I have a personal experience about an extended state
of consciousness, or rather whole-body consciousness (this experience actually made me consciousness
theoretician!). During this state I could see my thoughts as vivid visual images and had also peculiar
odour and taste experiences also reported to occur during mystic experiences.
Imagination could involve p-adic-to-real phase transitions transforming p-adic imagery to nerve
pulse patterns or membrane oscillations. The genuinely p-adic aspect of imagination could be analo-
gous to a free choice of initial values in a computer simulation, which are then transformed to their
real counterparts initiating neural activity.
Why imagination does not involve sensory qualia could be explained in several manners.
1. Primary sensory qualia are realized at the level of sensory receptors and brain constructs only
higher level symbolic representations of the sensory input and quantum entanglement binds
these representations together. For imagination sensory receptor level is absent. This would
also explain rapid eye movements during dreams as being related to the construction of visual
qualia. Dreaming is indeed a cognitive activity which is learned gradually (at young age dreamer

284
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
sees only static images).
One could understand why motor activities are not accompanied
by sensory experiences associated with motor pathways. The obvious reason for why sensory
imagination should not create lively images is that this would lead to a dangerous mixing of the
real and virtual. If this interpretation is correct, the study of whether feedback from brain to
sensory organs occurs during sensory hallucination, provides a manner to test whether sensory
hallucination is a telepathic experience resulting from the sharing of mental images or whether
it might be constructed in brain by feedback to sensory receptors.
2. Imagination could rely on membrane oscillations just as higher level cognition. The ﬁnding that
imagination does involve patterns of activity at visual cortex similar to those associated with
ordinary visual perceptions does not support this idea.
3. If higher level sensory representations are realized at the magnetic canvas, the diﬀerence between
imagination and real sensory experience could result from the absence of the projection to the
sensory canvas. Also the absence of negentropic entanglement could be the reason. This state
of aﬀairs could have a detectable EEG correlate: for instance, in 40 Hz resonance band. The
projector MEs responsible for the cognitive representation could be activated but be p-adic and
project only cognitive images. One can however wonder why magnetic body is at all conscious
about imagined mental images if it does not share these mental images.
If this explanation is correct would be also possible to have sensory experiences at brain level
only. For instance, unconscious seeing would would be possible. This kind of blind vision is
indeed known to be possible and will be discussed later.
Motor output and the ultimate output giving rise to our sensory experience might be very closely
related: motor action could be like printing or some control activity and sensory and cognitive repre-
sentations like pictures at the monitor screen. This picture looks attractive but might neglect some
deep diﬀerences suggested already by the anatomy of the central nervous system. There are reasons to
expect that the construction of sensory percepts and motor activity could be geometric time reversals
of each other at some levels of the self hierarchy (MEs in certain time scales). This view would mean
that motor action starts from a rough sketch for the outcome of the motor action and quantum jump
by quantum jump ends up to the complete performance by a process which might be regarded as a
gradual carving of a four-dimensional sculpture relying on both ordinary and time reversed dissipation
serving as a Darwinian selectors so that the very many sketches would lead to the same outcome. Both
these views might make sense: which view is correct depends on what time scale one is considering.
Are the space-time sheets and sub-CDs representing objects of the perceptive ﬁeld gen-
erated automatically?
One of the poorly understood aspects of sensory perception is how objects of the perceptive ﬁeld
are generated at the level of cognitive representations.
The problem is especially diﬃcult in the
computational approach to consciousness. Natural idea is that the objects of cognitive representation
directly reﬂect the objects of the physical world and that direct physical interaction creates these
objects automatically. Various visual illusions demonstrate that also apparent objects are generated
by sensory experience which suggests that it is nerve pulse patterns at the level of cortex which give
rise to the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld. In neural net approach to brain consciousness it is however
far from trivial what these objects could be.
In TGD approach objects of the perceptive ﬁeld correspond to mental images and thus subselves.
subselves in turn naturally correspond to mindlike space-time sheets. Therefore the problem reduces
to that of understanding how sensory input gives rise to mindlike space-time sheets: in particular,
how the sensory input or nerve pulse activity induced by it determines the boundaries of the mindlike
space-time sheets.
On of the basic laws about sensory experiencing is that only changes are experienced. Quantum
model for the contents of consciousness of self implies this law at quantum level: only the averages
of the increments of quantum numbers and zero modes are experienced consciously. By ’Ontogeny
recapitulates phylogeny’ principles this law should have realization also at the level of dynamics of
the space-time surface.
A possible space-time level counterpart of this law is that the primary at the level of primary
sensory organ or secondary sensory stimulus at the level of cortex generates K¨ahler electric ﬁeld

5.4. Sensory representations
285
proportional to the gradient of the stimulus. This creates however a problem. K¨ahler electric ﬂux
must be conserved in the approximation that vacuum Maxwell’s equations are satisﬁed (they are not
exactly satisﬁed since vacuum can carry currents of K¨ahler charge). Suppose that stimulus has a
strong gradient: where does the K¨ahler electric ﬂux go? The answer is simple: mindlike space-time
sheet is generated and the ﬂux goes to the mindlike space-time sheet through wormhole contacts! Since
sensory stimulus varies rapidly at the boundaries of the objects of the external world, this means that
the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld are automatically represented by mindlike space-time sheets and
give rise to selves, mental images in the cognitive representation! Several cognitive representations
with diﬀerent decomposition into objects are possible.
Also an alternative formulation of the title is as a question whether the sub-CDs serving as
imbedding space correlates for the mental images are generated automatically. One could argue that
quantum jump sequence generates these sub-CDs and that directed attention could induce them.
Negentropy Maximization Principle suitably generalized to state that the diﬀerence for the negen-
tropies of the ﬁnal and initial state is as large as possible for a given CD might favor the generation
of negentropic sub-CDs. Also the argument for the arrow of psychological time suggests that NMP
should have this kind of generalization.
Spectroscopy of consciousness
In its original form the spectroscopy of consciousness stated that one could assign to various qualia
-say colors, tastes, or odors- frequencies so that the frequency patterns would provide a spectroscopic
signature of the microscopic structure of conscious experience just like frequency patterns allow to
deduce highly detailed information about the structure of a distant star. Spectroscopy of consciousness
could be for the brain science what atomic spectroscopy has been for physics and chemistry.
In its original form this idea turned out to be un-realistic. Sensory qualia as such do not seem to
correspond to frequencies. Rather, frequencies would code for the geometric data. For the cyclotron
frequencies at least only the frequency ratios seem to have a deeper meaning. The fundamental fre-
quencies assignable to CDs however deﬁne an exception in this respect. Spectroscopy of consciousness
in a more realistic form would relate to the coding of geometric data such as positions, size scales
and state of motion for the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld. Frequency scales could also distinguish
between higher level sensory representations assigned to brain regions of various size scales. The basic
frequencies would be fundamentals and their harmonics assignable to CDs, cyclotron frequencies, and
Josephson frequencies.
1. Spectroscopy of consciousness and size scales of brain structures
The size scales for various parts of brain could mapped to frequency scales characterizing the sizes
of the parts of dark magnetic body so that a kind of collection of zoomed up images of brain regions
would be obtained. Images of brain regions would be mental images assignable to them to the sensory
receptors entangled with them.
1. In [K65] it is found that a simple scaling law v = λf relating the apparent wavelength and phase
velocity of EEG wave and more general em waves with its frequency allows to understand the
basic anatomical structure of the central nervous system as reﬂecting evolution regarded as the
emergence of new p-adic length scales. Scaling law allows also to predict which frequencies cor-
respond to qualia experienced at a given level of the p-adic self hierarchy for a given conduction
velocity of nerve pulses identiﬁed as an eﬀective propagation velocity of EEG waves. Scaling
law could also relate the sizes L(magn) ∼L(EEG) of the radial magnetic ﬂux tube structures
(magnetic canvas or magnetic body) associated with the secondary sensory organs of size L ∼λ:
L(magn) ∼L(EEG) = c/f = (c/v)L. Wave length of EEG could code for the size of the
structure deﬁning a kind of zoom-up of the brain region in question at the magnetic body.
2. The hierarchy of Planck constants allows to understand how photons for which the energies
E = hf are much below the thermal energy in standard quantum theory can be so important
biologically. EEG photons would obviously have a rather large value of Planck constant. This
hypothesis encourages the identiﬁcation of the above deﬁned velocity ratio as r = c/v = ℏ/ℏ0. ℏ
would be Planck constant for say ELF photons communicating the signal to the corresponding
dark layer of the magnetic body. In brain the dark photons could be transformed to ordinary
short wave length photons by a leakage to r = 1 page of the Big Book in an energy conserving

286
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
manner. The part of the magnetic body at a particular page of the Big Book would represent
an r-fold zoom up of the brain region considered. If one takes seriously the proposal that DNA
double strands act as relay stations between the brain and magnetic body, these values of Planck
constants could be assigned with the ﬂux tubes assigned to DNA nucleotides. I have proposed a
similar scenario but with motivations coming from an attempt to understand how the realization
of the genetic code at the level of dark nucleon physics discovered for few years ago could relate
to the biochemistry and DNA [L2, K32, K83] , [L2] .
3. The fundamental frequencies would be most naturally cyclotron frequencies of charged elemen-
tary particles and biologically important ions at the magnetic ﬂux tubes with large ℏ. TGD based
nuclear physics predicts also the possibility of exotic chemically equivalent bosonic counterparts
of the ordinary fermionic ions so that Bose-Einstein condensate of also these ions at cyclotron
states could deﬁne macroscopic quantum phases. The corresponding higher level qualia would
correspond to phase transitions changing cyclotron quantum numbers. Cyclotron energies scale
as ℏso that energy scale would distinguish between diﬀerent pages of the Big Book whereas
frequency would be the same form them if the strength of the magnetic ﬁeld is same for all the
pages. Energy coding would be in question. These photons would be naturally generated at
the magnetic ﬂux tubes which suggests that they could be used for communications from the
magnetic body to biological body.
2. Spectroscopy of consciousness, CDs, and Josephson junctions
Zero energy implies the notion of CD as imbedding space correlate of self and the moduli space
of CDs should play a key role in the understanding of the geometric qualia. Hence the spectroscopy
of consciousness could relate very closely to the scales of CDs.
1. For a ﬁxed value of ℏrather few size scales for CDs would be involved (nuclei, quarks, elec-
tron plus their possibly existing p-adically scaled up variants). The fundamental frequencies
assignable to CDs would correspond to the time scales of CDs and would scale like 1/ℏwhereas
energy would not be aﬀected in the scaling of ℏ.
2. The problem is that for energies above thermal energy at physiological temperatures the size
scale of CD should correspond to those assignable to very heavy particles.
If only photon
energies above thermal energy are relevant for biology the frequencies 10 Hz and 1 kHz assigned
to electron and quarks would be excluded. If the leakage of classical em oscillations of given
frequency leaking between diﬀerent pages of the Big Book automatically generates photons with
scaled up energies, the problem disappears. Each of the r sheets of the many-sheeted covering
would carry single quantum with the original frequency. The frequency would be r-fold harmonic
of the frequency of the fundamental for the scaled up CD.
3. Also Josephson frequencies associated with the cell membrane identiﬁed as Josephson junction
(also ﬂux tubes connecting the membrane to DNA strand could serve as Josephson junctions)
are involved. Josephson energies do not depend on ℏsince the frequencies behave like 1/ℏso
that a hierarchy of representations at the pages of the Big Book in diﬀerent time scales would
be obtained as kind of spatio-temporal zoom-ups. In this case the communications would be
naturally from the biological body tothe magnetic body and sensory data could be communicated
in this manner.
4. The photon energy E ∼.05 eV assignable to the cell membrane potential energy is at the border
of the thermal threshold and corresponds to a wave length λ = 2.4 × 10−5 meters. For M89
corresponding to intermediate gauge bosons one has L(89, 2) = L(178) ≃1.2×10−4 m - the size
scale of a large neuron and only 5 time longer than λ so that r = 5 would allow to overcome the
thermal threshold. Could even intermediate gauge boson length scale be relevant for biology?
The lifetime of intermediate gauge boson is much shorter than this time scale but one can ask
whether photons could correspond to M89.
3. Spectroscopy of consciousness and the moduli space of CDs
Consider next the concrete realization of the spectroscopy of consciousness in terms of the moduli
space of CD.

5.4. Sensory representations
287
1. The moduli space of CDs which is Cartesian product of part associated with M 4 degrees of
freedom and CP2 dgrees of freedom.In M 4 degrees of freedom one has the position of say lower
tip parameterized by M 4 and the coordinates for the relative position of tips deﬁning sub-set of
the future directed light-cone M 4
+. The position in M 4 for the lower tip of sub-CD could code
for the position of the object of the perceptive ﬁeld.
2. The quantization of the proper time distance between the tips in octaves reduces the situation
to a union of hyperboloids and a further discretization to a lattice of hyperboloid is suggestive
by number theoretical considerations. The interaction of a photon with this kind of hyperboloid
representing sub-CD is resonant if the frequency corresponds to the temporal diﬀerence between
the tips as measured in the rest system of CD so that frequency coding of the Lorentz boost
performed for sub-CD results.
3. One particular application would be the coding of the velocity (including its direction) of an
object of perceptive ﬁeld to the boost applied to sub-CD leaving its lower tip invariant. The
positions of sub-CDs would not be updated continually and the sensation about continuous
motion would result from the separate representation of the velocity.
This interpretation is
supported by a syndrome in which patient does not perceive motion and the positions for the
objects of the perceptive ﬁeld are updated with so long time intervals that the ordinary street
traﬃc is too dangerous for the patient. The size scales of sub-CDs would give rise to a natural
length scale hierarchy characterizing the sizes of the details of the representation. M 2 ⊂M 4
ﬁxed partially by the tips of CD deﬁnes preferred quantization axes for energy and spin and
this choice would be be relevant for purely quantal aspects of the sensory representation. The
Lorentz boosts of discrete spectroscopies would code for the motion of the objects of perceptive
ﬁeld.
4. In CP2 degrees of freedom moduli would correspond to CP2 × CP2 such that for both factors a
preferred point and a homologically trivial geodesic sphere S2 has been selected. Thes choices
give rise to ﬂag manifold SU(3)/U(1) × U(1) labeling the choices of the quantization axes. In
the recent case color rotations for the tips would represent the geometric data at the basic level.
Also now discretization for the CP2 points assignable with the second tip would be natural.
M 8 −H duality is fundamental element of quantum TGD and means that CP2 points code
for hyper-quaternionic planes of hyper-octonionic M 8 containing a preferred M 2. This would
suggest that CP2 could also code for geometric data as is suggested by the ﬁndings of Barbara
Shipman concerning the role of the ﬂag-manifold SU(3)/U(1) × U(1) in the model of honeybee
dance [A21] . The hyper-quaternionic plane assignable to the point of space-time surface at
given point identiﬁed as a plane spanned by the modiﬁed gamma matrices would correspond to
a point of CP2.
Spectroscopy of consciousness is considered in detail in [K65] - the spirit is of course extremely
adventurous since so little is known and potential reader can take this as a mere exercise perhaps
helping to identify the rules of the game. Especially fascinating is the possible connection of the theory
of the magnetic qualia with atomic and nuclear spectroscopy: the structure of the periodic table could
reﬂect itself directly itself in the spectroscopy of consciousness via cyclotron frequencies inversely
propotional to the masses of ions. Various full electronic shells (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe) correspond to
a hierarchy of geometric qualia relating directly with the band structure of EEG. The periods also
could also relate to the ﬁve-layered structure of sensory cortex (primary, secondary, etc... areas).
5.4.3
Is the pain in the toe in the toe, in brain, or somewhere else?
The basic question concerns about the seat of the primary sensory experience. There are three options.
1. Standard neuroscience says that our sensory experience can be localized to cortex.
2. The apparently very naive view is that sensory experience receives a contribution also from the
primary sensory organs. Certainly primary sensory organs could be experiencers in TGD frame-
work (and probably are) but this experience need not contribute to our sensory consciousness
unless there is a negentropic entanglement between brain and sensory organs. Let us assume
further that magnetic body plays no role.

288
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
3. The notion of magnetic suggests that sensory representations conscious-to-us correspond to a
sequence of entanglements connecting the magnetic body and the primary sensory organ and
perhaps including even to the object of the external world. This pictures diﬀers in even more
radical manner about the view of standard neuroscience. As far as the analysis of the sensory
data is considered, this view need not diﬀer in an essential manner from the standard view:
magnetic sensory canvas could be analogous to a passive monitor screen. Magnetic body could
also participate actively to the construction of the percept by sending virtual sensory feed-back
through brain to the sensory organs.
The view 2) is not automatically excluded in TGD framework as it is in standard neuroscience.
1. The experiments of Libet about passive aspects of consciousness [J56] could be seen as supporting
the hypothesis that the data is sent to the magnetic body, which causes the time lapse meaning
that the sensory data is .3-.5 seconds old [K86] .
2. The location of primary qualia to the level of sensory receptors would also allow to understand
why sensory pathways are specialized to deﬁnite qualia despite the fact that there seems to be
no obvious structural or functional diﬀerences at neuronal level. As already found, one could
also understand the diﬀerence between imagination and sensory experience and why feedback
to visual receptors (REM) is present during dreaming.
3. The identiﬁcation of long term memories as multitime experiences containing contributions from
the distant geometric past forces to consider the possibility that sensory organs are primary sen-
sory experiencers whereas the standard dogma of the neuro science is that all sensory experiences
occur at brain level at geometric now. The idea that also primary sensory organs are seats of
the primary sensory experiences, could explain Libet’s experiments, explains the observation
that persons who have become blind gradually, lose their ability to have dreams and also the
rapid eye movements and feedback from brain to auditory organs during REM sleep. It must
be emphasized that these phenomena can be understood also in options 1) and 3).
One can represent several objections against the identiﬁcation of the primary sensory organs as
seats of our primary sensory experience (Option 2)1.
1. The ﬁrst class of objections is that our sensory perception involves a lot of computation (consider
stereo vision as an example) and this computation cannot be performed at the level of the sensory
organ. These objections look at ﬁrst rather convincing but relate only to the cognitive aspects
of sensory perception, not the to the primary sensory qualia. The computation can be carried
out and involve also magnetic body and the back-projection to the primary sensory organs could
allow to construct the percept as an artwork at the level of primary sensory organ.
2. The second class of objections is related to the explanatory power of the idea of standard neu-
roscience that entire sensory pathways containing also neurons of cortex are seats of the sensory
experience (For option 1) they are involved with the construction of the sensory experience).
This idea allows to regard brain as kind of musical instrument such that each neuron produces its
characteristic sensory experience so that our experiences are combinations of the primitive neu-
ronal experiences. For conscious information processing this is a crucial advantage: for instance,
incoming nerve pulse patterns in associative regions of brain are consciously diﬀerentiated from
each other as diﬀerent modalities so that same nerve pulse pattern can have diﬀerent meaning
as sensory modalities. This objection suggests that the idea of restricting sensory experiences at
the level of primary sensory organs is wrong. On the other hand, neuronal pathways and brain
could be specialized to build cognitive representations and primary sensory qualia could be at
the level of sensory receptors. The feedback from brain to the sensory receptor level could also
make possible to manipulate the sensory input.
3. The view about brain as a collection of standard features which are activated by the sensory
input and projected to the magnetic canvas and thus associated with the objects of perceptive
ﬁeld is in conﬂict with the idea that our experience receives a direct contribution from the
1The topic of discussion might look rather academic from the point of view of neuro science but it is not that in
TGD framework: it took years to decide whether this idea could make sense or not.

5.4. Sensory representations
289
primary sensory organs. Situation of course changes if one allows entanglement of brain with
sensory organs.
4. The phenomena like dreams, hallucinations, synesthesia, phantom limb, and the experiences
generated by stimulating neurons of sensory pathways and projected pain are obvious counter
arguments against the idea that sensory organs are primary sensory experiencers (or form parts
of them).
The identiﬁcation of the long term memories as multitime experiences allows in
principle to overcome these objections, and a more detailed discussion of this point is in order.
In the following the explanations of various strange phenomena of sensory consciousness are studied
and the explanations provided by the options 1), 2) and 3) are compared. It must be emphasized
that the possibility that even sensory organs (and even neurons) have senses is not excluded by these
arguments: what is however clear that our sensory landscape is constructed in cortex.
Back projections and cross projections
During REM sleep rapid eye movements occur and are thought to accompany dreaming. It is not
however clear to me whether the correlation between rapid eye movements and visual dreaming is
one-to-one. The ringing of the ears is a real physical process occurring in ear and these otoacoustic
emissions, as they are called, can be sometimes heard by even outsider [K61] . Rapid eye movements
during dreams and otoacoustic emissions can be regarded as backprojections from brain to primary
sensory organs.
1. These phenomena can be understood without any diﬃculties in the options 1) and 3).
For
instance, rapid eye movements could be understood as feedback generated by a visual dream.
2. For the option 2) rapid eye movements could be seen as necessary prerequisite of dreaming and
to ”qualiafy” imagined mental images.
Synesthesia involves cross-modal associations of form A →B (say visual to auditory).
1. In option 2) both dreams, hallucinations, and synesthesia rely on the feedback from brain to
sensory organs to ”qualiafy” the mental images.
The prediction is that there should be a
feedback, not only between sensory areas, but between sensory organs or the cross-associated
qualia. This prediction is certainly testable. For instance, auditory-visual synesthesia should be
lost if eyes are damaged.
2. The simplest view allowed by options 1) and 3) is that this kind of sensory leakage occurs at
the level of neuronal connections.
Projected pain and phantom leg
Projected pain and phantom leg provide a further test for the proposed options.
1. For the standard explanation (option 1)) one must assume that the experience of pain is localized
to the somato-sensory map in brain. The explanation of the projected pain is based on the
observation that projected pain is felt in the body part which was very near to the body part
contain the actual cause during early developmental stages.
If somatosensory maps are not
updated properly, projected pain becomes possible. This applies also to option 2).
2. For option 2) the explanation of phantom pain as a remembered pain and thus as a real pain
in the geometric past when the limb still existed, is the simplest one. Projected pain cannot be
however interpreted as a remembered pain since the physical cause of pain is in the geometric
now. The assumption that the sensory pain (as distinguished from psychic pain) is a cortical
sensation whereas only pure sensory experiences would be located in the primary sensory organs
looks rather strange taking into account the universality of emotions as entropic qualia. What
goes wrong with this argument is that the experience of pain is confused with the experience
about where the pain is. The wrong location could result when the mental image about pain
is projected in a wrong manner to the body map. A leakage between sensory pathways could
cause the wrong localization.

290
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
3. Also for option 3) the simplest explanation of the phantom leg phenomenon is that the pain is
geometrically remembered pain from the period when the leg still exists and thus would have
a real cause. Also other possibilities can be imagined. The loss of the physical limb need not
mean the loss of its magnetic counterpart so that phantom pain might be caused by either by
a sensory input from other parts of leg projected to the part of the magnetic sensory canvas
representing the lost leg. This could explain also the projected pain. The magnetic map of body
coded by MEs could be partially out-of-date so that some parts of this map correspond to the
structure of biological body during the early developmental periods. The pain in left arm during
heart attack could be understood in this manner.
Color constancy and sensory organs as primary experiencers
The phenonenon of color constancy [J6] , which forms one of the most important aspects of vision, is a
further objection against the identiﬁcation of sensory organs as primary sensory experiences. At least
if one believes that colors are primary sensory qualia. If the object of the visual ﬁeld is illuminated
with a monochromatic light of constant intensity, its color does not change. This is quite contrary
to what one might expect on basis of what is expected to happen in the color sensitive cones in
retina detecting wavelenghts concentrated around blue, red and green. A particular case of the color
constancy phenomenon arises when entire visual ﬁeld is illuminated with a monochromatic light of a
constant intensity: what is experienced is complete darkness. The ability to see the real colors of the
objects of the external world, which is made possible by the color constancy phenomenon, is of course
extremely valuable for survival purposes.
1. For option 1) color constancy is a challenge. Color constancy suggests that retina cannot be
the primary sensory experiencers of color qualia since in this case our subjectively experienced
world would be changing its colors continually. This conclusion might be too hasty. In fact, one
could defend the hypothesis about sensory organs as primary sensory experiencers and use color
constancy as a guide line in the attempts to guess how sensory representations for the objects
of the external world are generated as sub-CDs residing at the retina.
2. In option 2) and 3) it can be assumed that the subtraction of the background involves com-
putational processing at the level of brain. If the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld are generated
at the level of brain by nerve pulse patterns, this is probably the case. The subtraction of the
background is possible to realize by excitatory and inhibitory projections and mathematically
one can regard the sensory image of a colored object of a perceptive ﬁeld as an integral function
for the gradient of the intensity of the sensory input. For a monochromatic constant input the
derivative vanishes as also integral function. The task therefore is to realize this integral function
in terms of a neural circuit using excitatory and inhibitory inputs and outputs.
The explanation of the color constancy could reduce to the hypothesis that sensory qualia corre-
spond to increments of quantum numbers rather than quantum numbers themselves.
1. If the color perception generated by the illumination at a particular wavelength depends only
on the spatial gradient of the illumination, color constancy follows as a consequence. Since the
eye is performing saccadic motion, this translates to a temporal gradient of illumination. The
temporal change of the illumination at a particular wavelength should thus induce a particular
color quale.
But this is consistent with the assumption that color qualia correspond to the
increments of color quantum numbers in the quantum jump. This model explains also why the
saccadic motion is necessary to generate color qualia, and qualia at all. Quite sensory percepts
result only when physical change is involved. Saccadic motion maps the gardients of illumination
to increments of color quantum numbers.
2. One might also understand why a rotating Benham top containing only black and white regions
can produce color sensations. Since both the saccadic motion and the motion of disk are involved,
one can imagine that for a rotating disk the proportions of various primary qualia are aﬀected
such that a net color is perceived.
For instance, the intensity of the perceived color could
depend on the velocity with which the eye crosses the intensity gradient and this dependence
could depend on wavelength.

5.4. Sensory representations
291
All geometric aspects of sensory experiences should reduce to representations generated by zero
modes, in particular zero modes characterizing classical K¨ahler ﬁeld, which can reduce to pure elec-
tromagnetic (vision?) or Z0 ﬁeld (auditory experience?). Color constancy could be understood if the
incoming light intensities associated with the wavelengths around three basic colors generate K¨ahler
electric ﬁelds proportional to the gradient of the intensity. If the gradient is strong, as it is on the
boundary of the retinal or neural image of the object, the conservation of the K¨ahler electric ﬂux
forces the generation of mindlike space-time sheet at which part of the ﬂux goes.
Thus retina would automatically create representation for the objects of the visual ﬁeld as mindlike
space-time sheets, which in turn could give rise to subselves representing objects of the visual ﬁeld
as mental images! These objects need not however correspond to our conscious experiences. In fact,
the boundaries of all objects of perceptive ﬁeld should be generated by strong gradients and same
principle would apply also to the higher level representations of sensory information. A gradient of
K¨ahler (electric) ﬁeld proportional to the gradient of primary/secondary sensory stimulus is generated
in primary/secondary sensory organ and automatically generates mindlike space-time sheets, which
give rise to subselves representing the decomposition of the perceptive ﬁeld to objects.
Blind sight and Anton’s syndrome
In blind sight cortically blind patient claims to be blind but is actually able to locate objects in the
visual ﬁeld when asked to do that. By training the patient can even develop some kind of primitive
conscious experience of motion, shape and color.
1. For option 1) blind sight looks ﬁrst problematic since the basic assumption is that primary
visual qualia are generated at the level of retina. If the entanglement with retina is lost the
visual qualia at retina are not assigned with the magnetic sensory canvas and the person is not
conscious that his eyes see. The primitive conscious experiences of motion, shape and color would
arise at the sub-cortical level make it possible to locate objects in the visual ﬁeld. Blind sight
would be also vision without cortical cognition (such as feature recognition). Training would
generate gradually entanglement between sub-cortical areas and the cortical areas responsible
for projections to the sensory magnetic canvas.
2. In option 2) the explanation for the blind sight would be the existence of two separate visual
systems. Possible candidates for these systems as regions of cortex have been even identiﬁed [?]
.
3. In option 3) blind sight has several explanations.
The simplest explanation is that the ne-
gentropic entanglement between magnetic body and brain is absent so that brain would see
consciously but not the magnetic body representing us. Blind sight could thus be interpreted
as a support for the notion of magnetic body. A test for the magnetic canvas hypothesis might
be based on the elimination of the MEs responsible for the sensory projection to the magnetic
canvas somehow. This option is of course not the only possible one. There is entire p-adic
hierarchy of increasingly reﬁned visions involving retinal vision, amygdalar vision, and various
visions corresponding to sensory areas of cortex.
The patient suﬀering from Anton’s syndrome is cortically blind but claims that he sees but behaves
as if he were blind and confabulates all kinds of explanations for his behavior.
1. The advocate of option 1) could argue that patient sees at the subcortical level and hence has
pure experience of vision without any cortical cognitive processing of what he is seeing. Person
is cognitively blind. There would be no recognition of objects in the visual ﬁeld, to say nothing
about associations and memories related to these objects. Therefore sensory (or subcortical)
seeing would not help the patient much and he would behave eﬀectively as a blind person. One
could even consider the possibility that patient gradually loses the ability to see because this
ability is not useful anymore. A possible test (probably already carried out) for the hypothesis
is to check whether patient can show the direction of an intensive light source (even this might
require ”cognitive seeing”).
2. The standard explanation (option 2) is that patient is not conscious about being blind: the
fact that patent seems to gradually accept the situation that he does not see, supports this
explanation. It would be possible to have the experience of seeing without actually seeing.

292
Chapter 5. Quantum Model for Sensory Representations
3. Option 3) would allow the possibility that the parts of the cortex responsible for projecting
sensory data to the sensory magnetic canvas remain intact and that the visual images are visual
memories. It would not be surprising that this useless vision would be gradually lost. Note
however that lower level visual systems might work.
Woman without body
In his book ’The man who mistook his wife for a hat’ [J116] Oliver Sacks tells about a tragic situation
in which his patient lost totally her body image. Body image is provided by proprioception together
with vision and sense of balance. The sensory neurite suﬀered by the patient destroyed patient’s
proprioceptive sensory pathways. Patient did not however lose tactile senses. The proprioceptive ho-
munculi in patient’s parietal lobes suﬀered no injury. Patient learned to cope with everyday activities
by using vision and sense of balance and all kinds of clever feedback and feedforward mechanisms to
compensate the lost proprioception. For instance, patient regained her ability to speak, to keep her
bodily posture and walk. She however lost her balance immediately if she closed her eyes. Patient
did not however get back her phenomenal body image in this manner.
The loss of body image is not a problem for option 2) since neural pathways are prerequisites of
quantum entanglement between brain and sensory receptors (also these might have been destroyed).
Options 1) and 3) can explain the loss of body image without diﬃculties. These options could even
allow to regain the body image artiﬁcially, for instance by artiﬁcial neuronal stimuli providing a
representation for the positions of various body parts. In both cases artiﬁcial electric stimulation of
cortex should generate tactile sensations of some kind.
5.5
Updates since 2012
A considerable progress has occurred in the understanding of TGD inspired theory of consciousness
during the ﬁrst half of 2013.
I have not however included separate sections about this progress
since other chapters of ”TGD Inspired theory of consciousness” already contain the relevant material.
A detailed representation of the recent vision about TGD inspired theory of consciousness [K97] is
recommended for the reader interested in details and various philosophical problems and their solutions
in TGD framework.
The basic new result is that NMP applies only in the rational intersection of realities and p-adicities.
The new results are discussed at the end of the chapter ”Negentropy Maximization Principle” [K44].
The hypothesis that state function reduction means measurement of the density matrix implies that
quantum criticality as degeneracy of eigenvalues of the density matrix and NMP in the intersection
ﬁxes the p-adic prime associated with the criticality.
Also a close connection between quantum
criticality, vision about life as something in the intersection of realities and p-adicities, hierarchy
of eﬀective vales of Planck constant, negentropic entanglement, and p-adic cognition emerges. That
various speculative ideas about TGD integrate to single coherent structure, is certainly an encouraging
sign.
The more detailed view about structure of quantum jump in ZEO allows to see the state function
reductions to the opposite boundaries of causal diamond (CD) deﬁning the geometric correlate for
”spot light of consciousness” as sensory perception and motor action (for updates see the end of
”About the Nature of Time” [K3]). Motor action can be seen as time reversed sensory perception.
This symmetry is very profound and strong prediction and forces to modify dramatically the beliefs
about the arrow of geometric time and its relation to the subjective arrow of time.
This progress has led to the understanding of reﬂective level of consciousness (see the end of ”Quan-
tum Model of Memory” [K66]). Reﬂective consciousness - as opposed to phenomenal consciousness
represented by qualia - can be modelled in terms of various representations - be they sensory, memory,
or cognitive ones - and their time reversals representing expectations, plans, and intentions [K97].
The intuitive idea is that the representations should be approximate invariants under quantum jump
sequence. NMP [K44] indeed implies that negentropic entanglement is approximately invariant under
quantum jumps. This inspires the idea that various representations (sensory - , memory - , cognitive
- ) correspond to negentropically entangled systems - ”Akashic records”. Interaction free quantum
measurement allows non-destructive conscious reading of these representations in arbitrarily good
approximation.

5.5. Updates since 2012
293
Also the updated view about the realisation of representations is discussed at the end of the
chapter ”Quantum Model of Memory” [K66]. The basic assumption is that K¨ahler magnetic ﬂux tubes
carrying monopole ﬂux and topological light rays (”massless externals” (MEs)) parallel to them serve
as geometric correlates of quantum coherence and their braiding serves as correlate for negentropic
entanglement. This leads to a rather concrete picture about how various representations are realised
at the level of the magnetic body of the organism.
The conscious reading of the representations by interaction free scattering of dark photons together
with the assumption that biophotons result as dark photons transform to biophotons in energy con-
serving manner leads to a direct contact with the experimental reality. The encouraging ﬁnding made
during the last years is that biophotons and EEG correlate with each other: the reader interested in
a detailed model can consult ”Are dark photons behind biophotons” [K95] and ”Comments on the
recent experiments by the group of Michael Persinger” [K96].


Part II
TIME AND CONSCIOUSNESS

Chapter 6
Time and Consciousness
6.1
Introduction
The identiﬁcation of moments of consciousness as quantum jumps between quantum histories suggests
that our common sense picture about the time evolution of universe might be badly misguided by
the restrictions posed by the basic features of our conscious experience. What one can do is to try
to develop the most general picture about the cosmology of consciousness consistent with our own
conscious experiences and try to identify our position in this picture. Already in its recent form TGD
inspired theory of consciousness can give quite restrictive constraints on this Grand Scenario.
The understanding of how psychological time and its arrow emerge has been perhaps the most
longstanding problem of quantum TGD and TGD inspired theory of consciousness.
By quantum
classical correspondence the arrow of subjective time should be mapped to the arrow of geometric
time at the level of conscious experience. In similar manner the asymmetry between subjective future
and past should be correspond to an asymmetry between geometric future and past. What this means
at the level of details has been far from clear and I have proposed many partial answers to the question
about the arrow of geometric time. For instance: the geometric future inside light-cone contains much
more room than geometric past so that the space-time region about which the contents of conscious
experience are about tends to diﬀuse to the direction of the geometric future deﬁned by light-cone
proper time; perhaps the ﬂow of geometric time corresponds to a wave front of intentional action
identiﬁable as a phase transition changing intentions identiﬁed as p-adic space-time sheets transformed
to real space-time sheets; maybe the space-time sheet assignable to self topologically condensed to
a larger space-time sheet shifts in quantum jumps to the direction of geometric future some average
temporal distance perhaps deﬁned by CP2 length scale. All these proposals have provided only partial
answers, have led to paradoxes, and failed to give a ﬁrm quantitative grasp about the situation.
Also the original wrong view about the correspondence of real and p-adic numbers has generated
a lot of confusion. The natural belief of topologist would be that p-adic space-time sheets are mapped
to their real counterparts by a continuous map (some variant of what I called canonical identiﬁcation
making sense in p-adic thermodynamics). This map did not however respect symmetries and was
inconsistent with ﬁeld equations. Finally I was able to accept the natural belief of algebraist: reals
and various p-adic number ﬁelds must be glued to together along rationals and common algebraic
numbers to achieve generalization of the number concept and also that of imbedding space. What
was diﬃcult to accept was the highly non-intuitive implication that most points of p-adic space-
time sheets are at spatial and temporal inﬁnity in real (but not in p-adic) sense so that cognition
and intentionality would be literally cosmic phenomena and only cognitive representations would be
realized in a ﬁnite space-time volume in real sense (causal diamond) in terms of intersections of real
and p-adic space-time sheets consisting of rational and some algebraic points.
I have tried to tidy up the chapters so that they would not contain too many mammoth bones.
Since I can use only a ﬁnite amount of time to documentation purposes, I have not been completely
successful and this chapter as also others might contain statements which represent earlier archeological
strata. I hope that reader could forgive this. Benevolent reader might even take these chapters as
documents about how ideas have developed.

Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
6.1.1
The concepts of self and subjective memory
Self is identiﬁed as a subsystem able to remain unentangled during quantum jumps consisting of
unitary processes U deﬁning informational ”time evolutions” followed by a state function reduction
which in zero energy ontology includes also state preparation occurring for the negative energy part of
the state (zero energy state corresponds to physical event in positive energy ontology with negative and
positive energy parts of the state being identiﬁed as the counterparts of the initial and ﬁnal states of the
event). Bound state entanglement is stable against state function reduction so that conciousness would
be lost the bound state entanglement is generated. This would stop the sequence of state function
reductions initiated after the U-process. The notion of number theoretic entropy allows to assign
entanglement negentropy to algebraic entanglement probabilities so that NMP favors the generation
of entanglement in this kind of situation. This encourages the hypothesis that subsystem does not
lose consciousness if it generates algebraic entanglement with environment. This would correspond to
the fusion to the sea of consciousness in the spiritual terminology. Algebraic entanglement is possible
in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds which in turn encourages the proposal that living matter
corresponds to this intersection, and is therefore a critical phenomenon in number-theoretical sense
so that evolution involves in an essential manner the generation of algebraic entanglement.
One can say that self is a subsystem behaving like its own sub-Universe (with respect to NMP).
What this really means quantitatively is far from obvious and detailed view requires the introduction
of zero energy
The hypothesis that the experiences of self associated with the quantum jumps occurred after the
’wake-up’ sum up to single experience, implies that self can have memories about earlier moments of
consciousness. Therefore self becomes extended object with respect to subjective time and has a well
deﬁned ’personal history’. If temporal binding of experiences involves kind of averaging, quantum
statistical determinism makes the total experience deﬁned by the heap of the experiences associated
with individual quantum jumps reliable. Subjective memory associated with sensory mental images
has duration of about .1 seconds from the temporal resolution of sensory experience: it is quite possible
that our self has much longer duration. The subjectotemporal sequences of sub-selves make possible
to remember the digits of a phonenumber.
Subsystem X possessing self behaves essentially as a separate sub-Universe with respect to NMP.
An attractive hypothesis is that the experience of self is abstraction in the sense that the experiences
of sub-selves Xij of Xi are abstracted to average experience ⟨Xij⟩. This implies that the experiences
of sub-sub-...selves of X are eﬀectively unconscious to X. This self hierarchy is inﬁnite and has entire
Universe, God at the top. Temporal binding with averaging implies that experiences of individual
selves are reliable and abstraction brings in the possibility of quantum statistical determinism at the
level of ensembles.
6.1.2
Psychological time and its arrow
Quantum classical correspondence requires that the ﬂow of subjective time identiﬁed as a sequence of
quantum jumps should have the ﬂow of geometric time as a space-time correlate. The understanding
of the detailed relationship between these two times has however remained a long standing problem,
and I have proposed several models involving ad hoc assumptions. Only the emergence of zero energy
ontology allows an ad hoc free model for how the experienced ﬂow and arrow of geometric time
emerge, and answers why the relationship between geometric past and future is so asymmetric and
why sensory experience is about so narrow interval of geometric time. Also the notion of self reduces
in well-deﬁned sense to the notion of quantum jump with fractal structure [K3] .
The basic idea about the correspondence between subjective and geometric time is very simple.
Conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld represents a quantum superposition of space-time surfaces. Assume
that the attention of self is directed to a ﬁxed volume of the 8-D imbedding space. Quantum classical
correspondence requires that this quantum superposition in the ﬁrst approximation shifts towards
geometric past of the imbedding space so that self experiences eﬀective ﬂow of the geometric time as-
sociated with the space-time surface. This explanation works only if macroscopic quantum coherence
holds true so that one cannot regard the space-time surface as a ﬁxed arena of dynamics. Also the
representability of the space-time surfaces as sub-manifolds of 8-D imbedding space is essential. The
identiﬁcation of the fundamental volume of attention as a causal diamond inspired by zero energy
ontology based formulation of quantum TGD provides answers to more detailed questions. This iden-

6.1. Introduction
299
tiﬁcation means also that causal diamond of imbedding space rather than space-time sheet becomes
the space-time correlate of self.
6.1.3
Cosmology of consciousness
The idea about cosmology of consciousness is inspired by the prediction of the inﬁnite self hierarchy and
by quantum-classical correspondence principle [K44] . The expectation is that the fractal structure
of the many-sheeted space-time should directly reﬂect the general structure for the cosmology of
consciousness. For instance, the p-adic evolution of consciousness should have its counterpart at the
space-time level. Indeed, there are good reasons to believe that 4-surfaces have decomposition into real
regions and p-adic regions and that one can assign to each real region a ﬁnite prime p characterizing
the eﬀective p-adic topology of the real space-time region (or of light-like 3-surface or partonic 2-
surface) and the p-adic topology which the real region is near criticality to transform to. In zero
energy ontology this transformation indeed makes sense. Just like conﬁguration space is conjecture
to have a decomposition into regions DP labelled by inﬁnite p-adic primes P, the space-time surface
decomposes into real regions labelled by ﬁnite primes appearing in the decomposition of P.
Fractality suggests that there are conscious universes within conscious universes and the nested
structure of the topological condensate suggests that experiences of universes involve kind of abstrac-
tions about the experiences of the sub-universes they contain. The prediction of inﬁnite hierarchy of
selves and summation hypothesis for the experiences of selves is in accordance with this expectation.
Mind-like space-time sheets were introduced originally as space-time sheets of ﬁnite temporal
duration or alternatively as space-time sheets for which the classical determinism in the standard
sense of the word fails. In zero energy ontology all space-time sheets have ﬁnite temporal scale and
zero energy states associated with them have mind-like aspects. For instance, the positive and negative
energy parts of the fermionic state deﬁne a quantum representation for an abstraction for the Boolean
statement A →B with various instances of a and b appearing in the superposition.
Since mind like space-time sheets have a bounded time duration, one cannot assign to a quantum
jump a single value of the geometric time. Rather, our psychological time would be associated with
one of the inﬁnitely many irreducible sub-experiences associated with mind like space-time sheets and
the values of the psychological time range from zero to inﬁnity. Since selves contain sub-selves with
various values of psychological time, experiences are actually multitime experiences with respect to
both geometric and subjective time. The entire 4-dimensional space-time is a living system: both the
geometric future and past are living and participate in each moment of consciousness. Selves have
increasingly longer geometric and subjective memories and that at the limit of entire universe selves
have inﬁnitely long subjective memory.
6.1.4
Four-dimensional brain
The hypothesis that entire space-time surface is populated by mind like space-time sheets realized
in concrete manner in zero energy ontology in terms of causal diamonds (CDs) representing systems
participating in every moment of consciousness, means also dramatically new manner to understand
brain.
For instance, the problem of memory trivializes.
Geometric memory provides simulations
and expectations for what happened and will happen whereas subjective memory has interpretation
as immediate short term memory. The most plausible interpretation of long term memories is as
geometric memories represented by multitime snapshots.
This hypothesis explains the practically
unlimited capacity of autobiographical memory and also other basic aspects of long term memories
and avoids the counter arguments against the neural net models of long term memory. The paradigm
of four-dimensional brain (and body!) forces to reconsider the basic dogma of neuroscience stating
that sensory consciousness is associated with brain only and explains nicely the results of Libet’s
experiments. A concrete model of the long term memory is based on quantum mirror mechanism:
experience long term memory means looking at a quantum mirror at a distance of say light years.
The attribute ’quantum’ means that there is no need to code information to a classical signal, just
time like entanglement made possible by the classical nondeterminism of K¨ahler action and by p-adic
nondeterminism is enough.

Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
6.1.5
Evidence for TGD based time concept
The new concept of time follows from the quantum jump between quantum histories concept so that
tests for the latter are indirect tests for the former. Perhaps the strongest support for the new concept
of time comes from the requirement of the internal consistency of the world view. The phenomenon
of dissipation is paradoxical from the point of view of standard physics. It is generally accepted that
fundamental laws of classical physics are reversible whereas everyday reality is manifestly irreversible.
Thus the situation is rather scitzophrenic. Two worlds, the reversible and extremely beautiful world
of fundamental physics and the irreversible and mathematically rather ugly, irreversible ”real” world,
seem to exist simultaneously. Quantum jumps between quantum histories concept solves the paradox
and one can understand dissipative world as an eﬀective description forming ”almost” envelope for
the sequence of reversible worlds understood as entire time evolutions.
Quantum jumps between quantum histories concept explains the peculiar time delays of con-
sciousness revealed in the experiments of Libet and Kornhuber relating to active and passive roles
of consciousness [J56, J80] and the causal anomalies revealed by the experiments of Radin and Bier-
man [J31, J32, J112] . TGD predicts ”tribar eﬀect” as a general signature for the quantum jump
between quantum histories concept.
A further implication is quantum theory of self-organization. Self-organization means the orga-
nization of selves leading to ﬁxed point patterns analogous to those generated in Benard ﬂow. This
means that dissipation serves as a Darwinian selector of both genes and memes. Dissipation is present
also at the elementary particle level and leads to the selection of the p-adic eﬀective topologies of ele-
mentary particle space-time sheets. Black-hole elementary particle analogy suggests that the allowed
p-adic primes are given the p-adic length scale hypothesis p ≃2k, k power of prime.
6.2
TGD based concept of time
TGD based notion of time involves several new aspects. Quantum jump as occurring between en-
tire quantum histories rather than time=constant snapshots of a single history is certainly the most
decisive new element. The necessity to diﬀerentiate between subjective and geometric time is im-
mediate implication of this identiﬁcation. The classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action is second
fundamental ingredient: without it time would be lost in the sense that the contents of our conscious
experience would not be localized with respect to geometric time and one could not understand the
emergence of psychological time and its arrow. The new view about time leads also to the notion of
four-dimensional brain implying a new manner to see what long term memories are, and the vision
about space-time as a four-dimensional organism. A further new element is related to the possibility
of negative energy space-time sheets and classical communications also to the direction of geometric
past. The ﬁnal important ingredient is p-adic physics as physics of cognition and intention having
rather exotic implications, such as replication of p-adic memes by time reﬂection, their instantaneous
propagation by the same mechanism, and time reversed cognition. p-Adic physics as physics of in-
tentionality is crucial for understanding of the psychological time as a front of p-adic-to-real phase
transition transforming intentions to actions [K52] .
6.2.1
’Holy trinity’ of time developments
Quantum jump between quantum histories was originally believed to be something irreducible and
structureless. Gradually the view about quantum jump has however become more and more struc-
tured and as a result a connection the quantum standard measurement theory follows as a prediction
of quantum TGD. In what sense quantum jumps remains irreducible is that one cannot build any
dynamical model for the non-deterministic steps appearing in quantum jump.
The general structure of quantum jump
It has gradually become clear that TGD involves ”holy trinity” of dynamics.
1. The dynamics deﬁned by the preferred extremals of K¨ahler action corresponds to the dynam-
ics of material existence, with matter deﬁned as ”res extensa”, three-surfaces. What preferred
extremals really are has been a long standing open question. The recent formulation of the

6.2. TGD based concept of time
301
quantum theory using modiﬁed Dirac action leads to the proposal that the preferred extremals
are critical in the sense that they allow an inﬁnite number of deformations for which the sec-
ond variation vanishes. This serves as space-time counterpart for quantum criticality of TGD
Universe ﬁxing the fundamental variational principle uniquely.
2. The dynamics deﬁned by the action of the unitary ’time development’ operator U in the space
of quantum histories, is the counterpart of the ordinary Schr¨odinger time evolution U ≡U(−t, ),
t →∞and can be regarded as ”informational” time development occurring at the level of objec-
tive existence. It seems however un-necessary and in fact impossible to assign real Schr¨odinger
time evolution with U. U deﬁnes the S-matrix of the theory.
3. The dynamics of quantum jumps between quantum histories corresponds to the dynamics of
subjective existence.
Quantum jump was originally seen as something totally irreducible. Gradually the structure of
quantum jump has revealed itself.
1. The ﬁrst step in quantum jump is informational ’time development’
Ψi →UΨi ,
where U is the counterpart of the unitary process of Penrose. The resulting state is a completely
entangled multiverse state, the entire universe being in a holistic state of ’oneness’.
2. Then follows the TGD counterpart of state function reduction realized as a localization in zero
modes:
UΨi →Ψ0
f .
The assumption that localization occurs in zero modes of the conﬁguration space would pose
very important consistency condition on U: it must eﬀectively correspond to a ﬂow in zero modes
such that there is one-one correlation between the quantum numbers in quantum ﬂuctuating
degrees of freedom in some state basis and the values of the zero modes. This together with
the fact that zero modes are eﬀectively classical variables, would imply that the localization in
zero modes corresponds to a state function reduction. All p-adic conﬁguration space degrees
of freedom are zero modes so that in this sense cognition is classical. One must however be
cautious: also wave functions in zero modes are possible as will be argued below.
3. The state function reduction is followed by a cascade of self measurements in quantum ﬂuctuating
degrees of freedom (zero modes do not change during this stage)
Ψ0
f →.... →Ψf ,
whose dynamics is governed by the Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP). For a generic
entanglement probabilities his process leads to bound states or a completely unentangled state
or bound states identiﬁable as prepared states for the next quantum jup.
This process can
be regarded as an analysis or even decay process. If entanglement probabilities are algebraic
numbers, the state function reduction can lead to an entangled state with a positive entanglement
entropy.
4. Measurement theory requires an entanglement between zero modes and quantum jumps of the
physical state. The addition of a measurement interaction term to the modiﬁed Dirac action
coupling to four-momentum and color quantum numbers of the state and also to more general
conserved quantum numbers allows an explicit realization of this coupling and induces the addi-
tion of an analogous measurement interaction term to K¨ahler action [K25] . This term implies
the entanglement of the quantum numbers of the physical states with zero modes.
A good metaphor for quantum jump is as Djinn leaving the bottle (informational time develop-
ment), fulﬁlling the wish (quantum jump involving choice) and returning to, possibly new, bottle
(localization in zero modes and subsequent state preparation process). One could formally regard
each quantum jump as quantum computation lasting inﬁnitely long time t →∞followed by a state
preparation of the initial state of the next quantum computation.

302
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
Is the complete localization in zero modes really necessary?
The detailed inspection of what happens in quantum jumps forces to consider the possibility that
quantum jump involves always a compelete localization in zero modes. This was indeed the original
proposal. It however seems that a localization modulo ﬁnite measurement resolution might be a more
realistic assumption. Certinly it is enough to explain why the perceived Universe looks classical.
1. QFT picture strongly suggests that sub-system must be deﬁned as a tensor factor of the space
of conﬁguration space spinors at given point Y 3 of the conﬁguration space. This suggests that
subsystem should be deﬁned as a function of Y 3 and should be a local concept. An important
consequence of this deﬁnition is that entanglement entropy gives information about space-time
geometry.
2. Conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld can be formally expressed as superposition of quantum states
localized into the reduced conﬁguration space consisting of 3-surfaces belonging to light cone
boundary. Hence conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld can be formally written as
X
Y 3
C(Y 3)(n, N)|n⟩|N⟩
for any subsystem-complement decomposition deﬁned in Y 3. Clearly, conﬁguration space coor-
dinates appear in the role of additional indices with respect to which entanglement coeﬃcients
are diagonal. The requirement that ﬁnal state is pure state would suggest that quantum jump
reducing entanglement must involve complete localization of the conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld
to some Y 3 plus further quantum jump reducing entanglement in Y 3. Complete localization in
the conﬁguration space is however not physically acceptable option since the action of various
gauge symmetries on quantum states does not commute with the complete localization opera-
tion. In particular, the requirement that physical states belong to the representations of Super
Virasoro and super-symplectic algebras, is not consistent with this requirement.
3. Conﬁguration space has ﬁber space structure.
Conﬁguration space metric is non-vanishing
only in the ﬁber degrees of freedom and since the propagator for small ﬂuctuations equals to
the contravariant metric, ﬁber degrees of freedom correspond to genuine quantum ﬂuctuations.
Conﬁguration space metric vanishes in zero modes, which can be identiﬁed as fundamental order
parameters in the spirit of Haken’s theory of self organization. The requirement that various
local symmetries act as gauge symmetries, provides good reasons to expect that entanglement
coeﬃcients in the ﬁber degrees of freedom are gauge invariants and depend on the zero modes
parametrically. The one-one correlation between quantum numbers of the state assignable to
ﬁber degrees of freedom and classical variables identiﬁed as zero modes would encourate the
assumption the a complete localization occurs in zero modes. A weaker condition is that local-
ization occurs only modulo a ﬁnite measurement resolution.
4. The original argument was that the nonexistence of metric based volument element in zero
modes forces the wave functions in zero modes to have a discrete locus. There however exists
a symplectic measure deﬁned by the symplectic form in zero modes. It does not however allow
a complexiﬁcation to K¨ahler form as it does in quantum ﬂuctuating degreees of freedom. This
symplectic from could deﬁne a hierarchy of integration measures coming as restrictions of J∧J...∧
J with n factors to 2n-dimensional sub-manifolds. Under some additional conditions- maybe the
homological non-triviality of J and the orientability of the sub-manifold are enough, this measure
would deﬁne a positive deﬁnite inner product and one would have a hierarchy ﬁnite-dimensional
sub-spaces of zero modes. The maxima of K¨ahler function with respect to zero modes replace
naturally the continuum with a discrete set of points and deﬁne the counterpart of the spin
glass energy landscape consisting of the minima of free energy. Eﬀective ﬁnite-dimensionality
and even eﬀective discreteness would be achieved.
5. The time development by quantum jumps in zero modes is eﬀectively classical: Universe is
apparently hopping around in the space of the zero modes. This looks very attractive physically
since zero modes characterize the size, shape and classical K¨ahler ﬁelds associated with 3-surface.

6.2. TGD based concept of time
303
Therefore each quantum jump gives very precise conscious geometric information about space-
time geometry and about conﬁguration space in zero modes. This also means that Haken’s
classical theory of self-organization generalizes almost as such to TGD context. The probability
for localization to given point of zero mode space is given by the reduced probability density Q
deﬁned by the integral of the probability density R deﬁned by conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld
over ﬁber degrees of freedom. The local maxima of Q with respect to zero modes appear as
attractors for the time development by quantum jumps. Dissipative time development could be
regarded as a sequence of quantum jumps leading to this kind of local maximum.
6. Eﬀective localization in zero modes is completely analogous to spontaneous symmetry breaking
in which scalar ﬁeld attains vacuum expectation value with the diﬀerence that the number of
degrees of freedom is inﬁnite unlike in typical models of symmetry breaking. Thus the general
structure of the conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld together with TGD based quantum jump concept
automatically implies spontaneous symmetry breaking in its TGD version (note however that
particle massivation results from both p-adic thermodynamics and coupling to Higgs like ﬁeld of
purely geometric origin in TGD framework). TGD Universe is superposition of parallel classical
universes (3-surfaces). Therefore quantum entangled state can can be regarded as a superposition
of parallel entangled states, one for each 3-surface. Formally entanglement coeﬃcients can be
regarded as coeﬃcients containing the conﬁguration space coordinates of 3-surfaces as additional
index. The analogy with the spin glass also supports the localization in the zero modes.
7. Eﬀectie localization in the zero modes provides simple explanation for why the universe of
conscious experience looks classical: moment of consciousness makes it classical. It also explains
why the physics treating space-time as a ﬁxed arena of dynamics has been so successful. As
already found, a further important consequence is ﬁrst principle description of the state function
reduction.
6.2.2
Quantum jump as moment of consciousness and the notion of self
If quantum jump occurs between two diﬀerent time evolutions of Schr¨odinger equation (understood
here in very metaphoral sense) rather than interfering with single deterministic Schr¨odinger evolution,
the basic problem of quantum measurement theory ﬁnds a resolution. The interpretation of quantum
jump as a moment of consciousness means that volition and conscious experience are outside space-
time and state space and that quantum states and space-time surfaces are ”zombies”. Quantum jump
would have actually a complex anatomy corresponding to unitary process U, state function reduction
and state preparation at least.
Quantum jump has a complex anatomy since it must include state preparation, state function
reduction, and also unitary process characterized by U-matrix. Zero energy ontology means that one
must distinguish between M-matrix and U-matrix. M-matrix characterizes the time like entanglement
between positive and negative energy parts of zero energy state and is measured in particle scattering
experiments. M-matrix need not be unitary and can be identiﬁed as a ”complex” square root of density
matrix representable as a product of its real and positive square root and of unitary S-matrix so that
thermodynamics becomes part of quantum theory with thermodynamical ensemble being replaced
with a zero energy state. The unitary U-matrix describes quantum transitions between zero energy
states and is therefore something genuinely new. It is natural to assign the statistical description of
intentional action with U-matrix.
Intuitively self corresponds to a sequence of quantum jumps which somehow integrates to a larger
unit much like many-particle bound state is formed from more elementary building blocks. It also
seems natural to assume that self stays conscious as long as it can avoid bound state entanglement
with the environment: everything is conscious and consciousness can be only lost. This view predicts
inﬁnite self hierarchy with the entire Universe at the top.
If one accepts the hierarchy of Planck constants [K24] , it might be un-necessary to distinguish
between self and quantum jump. The hierarchy of Planck constants interpreted in terms of dark matter
hierarchy predicts a hierarchy of quantum jumps such that the size of space-time region contributing
to the contents of conscious experience scales like ℏ. Also the hierarchy of space-time sheets labeled
by p-adic primes suggests the same. That sequence of sub-selves/sub-quantum jumps are experienced
as separate mental images explains why we can distinguish between digits of phone number. The
irreducible component of self (pure awareness) would correspond to the highest level in the ”personal”

304
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
hierarchy of quantum jumps and the sequence of lower level quantum jumps would be responsible
for the experience of time ﬂow. Entire life cycle would correspond to single quantum jump at the
highest(?) level of the personal self hierarchy and pure awareness would prevail during sleep: this
would make it possible to experience directly that I existed yesterday. Whether these two deﬁnitions
of self are in some sense equivalent will be discussed later.
Self is assumed to experience sub-selves as mental images identiﬁable as ”averages” of their mental
images. This implies the notion of ageing of mental images as being due to the growth of ensemble
entropy as the ensemble consisting of quantum jumps (sub-sub-subselves) increases.
There are thus two deﬁnitions of self. The ﬁrst deﬁnition introduces self as a notion separate from
quantum jump. Second deﬁnition reduces the notion of self to a fractal hierarchy of quantum jumps.
The equivalence between two deﬁnitions of the notion of self will be proposed later.
6.2.3
Some aspects of classical non-determinism
The general view about the classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action and its role in TGD and TGD
inspired theory of consciousness has developed gradually and still does so. The newest developments
relate to the application of quantum gravitational hologram principle in TGD framework. What has
been however clear for a long time is that TGD inspired theory of consciousness falls or stands with
the classical non-determinism.
Vacuum extremals
Any 4-surface which belongs to M 4
+×Y 2, where Y 2 is so called Legendre manifold of CP2 representable
as
Pi = ∇if(Q1, Q2),
i = 1, 2 ,
where f is arbitrary function and (Pi, Qi) are some canonical coordinates of CP2, is vacuum extremal
of K¨ahler action.
For these vacuum extremals the signature of the induced metric can be either
Minkowskian or Euclidian. There are also vacuum extremals with Euclidian signature of the induced
metric. The so called CP2 type extremals are vacuum extremals having light like random curve as
light cone projection. These extremals are isometric with CP2 so that the signature of the induced
metric is Euclidian. These extremals provide a model for elementary particle.
Only the non-vacuum deformations of the vacuum extremals are physical. The remnants of the
huge vacuum non-determinism are expected to give rise to the non-determinism required by symbolic
representations of conscious experience at the level of space-time dynamics giving rise to language
as a special case. Of course, classical nondeterminism of the K¨ahler action might also relate to the
nondeterminism of volition although it seems that p-adic-to-real phase transitions are responsible
for the transformation of intentions to actions. It seems that the CP2 type extremals representing
cognitive neutrino pairs are crucial for our cognitive consciousness and its transformation to symbolic
representations.
Mind-like space-time sheets as deformations of vacuum extremals
The original proposal that mind-like space-time sheets and matter-like space-time sheets diﬀer in the
sense that the ﬁrst ones are non-deterministic and consist of a collection of 3-surfaces with time-
like separations whereas the latter are deterministic or at least have inﬁnite size in time direction
by standard conservation laws. In zero energy ontology mind-likeness in this sense holds true quite
generally.
Physical intuition suggests that the gluing vacuum extremals to a material space-time sheet X3(Y 3)
by # (topological sum) contacts, an interaction results and deforms vacuum extremal slightly and that
in some cases this leads to a new preferred extremal with a slightly larger value of K¨ahler function and
hence a larger value of the vacuum functional making the 3-surface more probable. These deformed
vacuum extremals are expected to be still non-deterministic although the non-determinism should
be reduced considerably. Via their interactions with the environment, (mind-like) space-time sheets
provide sensory and symbolic representations for some aspects of the surrounding world. Hence they
are quite generally natural geometric counterparts of selves. For instance, the time evolution of our
body would correspond to this kind of deformed vacuum space-time sheet with a ﬁnite time duration.

6.2. TGD based concept of time
305
The space-time surfaces X4
i (Y 3) are expected to be very nearly identical outside the time-interval
characterizing the size of the mind like space-time sheet: this in turn implies time localization for the
non-determinism of quantum jump and therefore for the contents of conscious experiences associated
with the mind like space-time sheet.
In zero energy ontology mind-like space-times sheets correspond to a collection of 3-surfaces be-
longing to boundaries of causal diamond (CD) and its sub-CDs corresponding to the classical correlate
for radiative corrections. Generalized causality makes it possible to avoid paradoxical situation: as-
suming that space-time surface X4(Y 3) is preferred extremal of the K¨ahler action for Y 3 one might
always ﬁnd a new 4-surface giving rise to a smaller K¨ahler action by gluing suitable vacuum extremal
to X4(Y 3).
Massless extremals as quantum gravitational holograms
Massless extremals (MEs) belong to the fundamental solutions of ﬁeld equations. It has become also
clear that they play the role of quantum gravitational holograms. The hologram principle of quantum
gravitational theories roughly states that the quantum theory in space-time with boundary reduces to
a conformal quantum ﬁeld theory at the boundary. If K¨ahler action were deterministic, precisely this
would happen. The construction of conﬁguration space geometry relies crucially on the assumption
that the complications due to the non-determinism of K¨ahler action does not radically modify the
construction based on the assumption of a complete determinism.
It has indeed turned out that the basic construction in which everything reduces to the light
like boundary of M 4
+ (moment of big bang) acting as a hologram in quantum gravitational sense
and deﬁning conformal quantum theory, generalizes. This construction survives as a template in a
more general construction in which also the light like boundaries of MEs having always light like
M 4
+ projection are taken into account besides δM 4
+ as surfaces at which initial values can be ﬁxed
arbitrarily. This brings in also time absent in a strictly deterministic theory. Thus the quantum
gravitational hologram deﬁned by δM 4
+ is replaced by a fractal structure formed by δM 4
+ and Russian
doll hierarchy of the light like boundaries of MEs inside MEs. The super-canonical and super-conformal
invariances of the light like boundaries indeed generalize in an elegant manner thanks to the basic
properties of MEs.
There are good reasons to expect that the light like selves deﬁned by the boundaries of MEs are
fundamental in TGD inspired theory of consciousness. The super-canonical quantum states associ-
ated with these boundaries are genuine quantum gravitational states deﬁned by conﬁguration space
functionals, whose dependence on the bosonic ﬁber degrees of freedom of the conﬁguration space does
not reduce to a mere vacuum functional given by the exponent of K¨ahler action. This means that
these states do not possess any quantum ﬁeld theoretic counterparts. They are state functionals in
the world of worlds, so to say, and therefore should represent highest level in the hierarchy of quantum
control in living systems. Thus it is the higher abstraction level of quantum gravitational states which
connects conscious intelligence and quantum gravitation.
6.2.4
Two times
The notion of quantum jump implies a new view about time. Experienced/subjective time corresponds
to a sequence of sub-quantum jumps and cannot be identiﬁed with the geometric time deﬁned as the
fourth space-time coordinate. This is of course obvious for anyone: consider only the reversibility of
geometric time contra irreversibility of experienced time, and the fact that both geometric past and
future exist whereas only subjective past exists. The fact that the contents of conscious experience
is about 4-D rather than 3-D space-time region, motivates the notions of 4-D brain, body, and even
society. In particular, conscious existence continues after biological death since 4-D body and brain
continue to exist.
6.2.5
About the arrow of psychological time
Quantum classical correspondence predicts that the arrow of subjective time is somehow mapped to
that for the geometric time. The detailed mechanism for how the arrow of psychological time emerges
has however remained open. Also the notion of self is problematic.

306
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
Two earlier views about how the arrow of psychological time emerges
The basic question how the arrow of subjective time is mapped to that of geometric time.
The
common assumption of all models is that quantum jump sequence corresponds to evolution and that
by quantum classical correspondence this evolution must have a correlate at space-time level so that
each quantum jump replaces typical space-time surface with a more evolved one.
1. The earliest model assumes that the space-time sheet assignable to observer (”self”) drifts along
a larger space-time sheet towards geometric future quantum jump by quantum jump: this is
like driving car in a landscape but in the direction of geometric time and seeing the changing
landscape. There are several objections.
i) Why this drifting?
ii) If one has a large number of space-time sheets (the number is actually inﬁnite) as one has in
the hierarchy the drifting velocity of the smallest space-time sheet with respect to the largest
one can be arbitrarily large (inﬁnite).
iii) It is alarming that the evolution of the background space-time sheet by quantum jumps,
which must be the quintessence of quantum classical correspondence, is not needed at all in the
model.
2. Second model relies on the idea that intentional action -understood as p-adic-to-real phase
transition for space-time sheets and generating zero energy states and corresponding real space-
time sheets - proceeds as a kind of wave front towards geometric future quantum jump by
quantum jump. Also sensory input would be concentrated on this kind of wave front. The
diﬃcult problem is to understand why the contents of sensory input and intentional action are
localized so strongly to this wave front and rather than coming from entire life cycle.
There are also other models but these two are the ones which represent basic types for them.
The third option
The third explanation for the arrow of psychological time - which I have considered earlier but only
half-seriously - looks to me the most elegant at this moment.
This option is actually favored by
Occam’s razor since it uses only the assumption that space-time sheets are replaced by more evolved
ones in each quantum jump. Also the model of tqc favors it.
1. In standard picture the attention would gradually shift towards geometric future and space-
time in 4-D sense would remain ﬁxed. Now however the fact that quantum state is quantum
superposition of space-time surfaces allows to assume that the attention of the conscious observer
is directed to a ﬁxed volume of 8-D imbedding space.
Quantum classical correspondence is
achieved if the evolution in a reasonable approximation means shifting of the space-time sheets
and corresponding ﬁeld patterns backwards backwards in geometric time by some amount per
quantum jump so that the perceiver ﬁnds the geometric future in 4-D sense to enter to the
perceptive ﬁeld. This makes sense since the shift with respect to M 4 time coordinate is an exact
symmetry of extremals of K¨ahler action. It is also an excellent approximate symmetry for the
preferred extremals of K¨ahler action and thus for maxima of K¨ahler function spoiled only by the
presence of light-cone boundaries. This shift occurs for both the space-time sheet that perceiver
identiﬁes itself and perceived space-time sheet representing external world: both perceiver and
percept change.
2. Both the landscape and observer space-time sheet remain in the same position in imbedding
space but both are modiﬁed by this shift in each quantum jump. The perceiver experiences this
as a motion in 4-D landscape. Perceiver (Mohammed) would not drift to the geometric future
(the mountain) but geometric future (the mountain) would eﬀectively come to the perceiver
(Mohammed)!
3. There is an obvious analogy with Turing machine: what is however new is that the tape eﬀectively
comes from the geometric future and Turing machine can modify the entire incoming tape by
intentional action. This analogy might be more than accidental and could provide a model for

6.2. TGD based concept of time
307
quantum Turing machine operating in TGD Universe. This Turing machine would be able to
change its own program as a whole by using the outcomes of the computation already performed.
4. The concentration of the sensory input and the eﬀects of conscious motor action to a narrow
interval of time (.1 seconds typically, secondary p-adic time scale associated with the largest
Mersenne M127 deﬁning p-adic length scale which is not completely super-astronomical) can be
understood as a concentration of sensory/motor attention to an interval with this duration: the
space-time sheet representing sensory ”me” would have this temporal length and ”me” deﬁnitely
corresponds to a zero energy state.
5. The fractal view about topological quantum computation strongly suggests an ensemble of al-
most copies of sensory ”me” scattered along my entire life cycle and each of them experiencing
my life as a separate almost copy.
6. The model of geometric and subjective memories would not be modiﬁed in an essential manner:
memories would result when ”me” is connected with my almost copy in the geometric past by
braid strands or massless extremals (MEs) or their combinations (ME parallel to magnetic ﬂux
tube is the analog of Alfwen wave in TGD).
This argument leaves many questions open.
What is the precise deﬁnition for the volume of
attention? Is the attention of self doomed to be directed to a ﬁxed volume or can quantum jumps
change the volume of attention? What distinguishes between geometric future and past as far as
contents of conscious experience are considered? How this picture relates to p-adic and dark matter
hierarchies? Does this framework allow to formulate more precisely the notion of self? Zero energy
ontology allows to give tentative answers to these questions.
6.2.6
What really distinguishes between future and past?
Our knowledge about geometric future is very uncertain as compared to that about geometric past.
Hence we usually use words like plan/hunch/hope/...
in the case of geometric future and speak
about memories in the case of geometric past. We also regard geometric past as something absolutely
stable.
Why we cannot remember geometric future as reliably as the geometric past?
Is it that
geometric future is highly unstable as compared to the geometric past? Why this should be the case?
This provides a possible TGD based articulation for the basic puzzles relating to time experience.
These questions have been already discussed in this chapter but I want to close the chapter with
considerations inspired by the latest progress in the understanding of quantum TGD.
Is p-adic-to-real phase transition enough?
The basic idea is that the ﬂow of subjective time corresponds to a phase transition front representing a
transformation of intentions to actions and propagating towards the geometric future quantum jump
by quantum jump. All quantum states have vanishing total quantum numbers in zero energy ontology
which now forms the basis of quantum TGD [K16] and this ontology allows to imagine models for
what could happen in this process.
This starting point is the interpretation of fermions as correlates for cognition bosons as correlates
for intentions/actions [K79] . Fermions correspond to pairs of real and p-adic space-time sheets with
opposite quantum numbers with p-adic space-time sheet providing a cognitive representation of the
real space-time sheet. Bosonic space-time sheets would be either p-adic or real and thus represent
intentions or actions. Fermionic world and its cognitive representations would be common to future
and geometric past and the asymmetry would relate only to the intention-action dichotomy.
Geometric future contains a lot of p-adic space-time sheets representing intentions which transform
to real space-time sheets allowing interpretation as desires inducing eventually neuronal activities.
Time mirror mechanism for intentional action assumes that the phase transition gives rise to negative
energy space-time sheets representing propagation of signals to geometric past where they induce
neuronal activities. From Libet’s experiments relating to neuronal correlates of volition the time scale
involved is a fraction of second but an inﬁnite hierarchy of time scales is implied by fractality.
Conservation of quantum numbers poses strong conditions on p-adic-to-real phase transition.
Noether charges are in the real context given by integrals over partonic 2-surfaces.
The problem
is that these integrals do not make sense p-adically. There are two options.

308
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
1. Give up the notion of p-adic Noether charge so that it would not make sense to speak about
four-momentum and other conserved quantum numbers in case of p-adic space-time sheet. This
implies zero energy ontology in the real sector. All real space-time sheets would have vanishing
conserved quantum numbers and p-adic-to real transition generates real space-time sheet com-
plex with vanishing total energy. Negative energy signal must be somehow compensated by a
positive energy state.
2. It might be however possible to assign charges to p-adic space-time sheets.
The equations
characterizing p-adic space-time sheet representing intention and corresponding real space-time
sheet representing action are assumed to be given in terms of same rational functions with
coeﬃcients which are algebraic numbers consistent with the extension of p-adic numbers used
so that the points common to real and p-adic space-time sheets are in this extension. If real
charges belong to the algebraic extension used, one could identify the p-adic charges as real
charges. Zero energy ontology requires the presence of positive energy real space-time sheets
whose charges compensate those of negative energy space-time sheets. One possibility is that
real and corresponding p-adic space-time sheets appear in pairs with vanishing total quantum
numbers just as fermionic space-time sheets are assumed to occur [K79] . In the case of fermions
p-adic-to-real phase transition is impossible by Exclusion Principle so that a stable cognitive
representation results.
The minimal option would be that p-adic space-time sheets possess negative energy and are trans-
formed to negative energy signals inducing neuronal activities. The ﬂow of subjective time would
involve a transformation of the universe to zero energy universe in the sense that total conserved
quantum numbers vanish in the real sense in bosonic sector but in fermionic sector real and p-adic
charges compensate each other.
This picture is probably too simple. Robertson-Walker cosmology has vanishing density of inertial
energy. Hence it would seem that real bosons and fermions should appear in both positive and negative
energy states and the arrow of time deﬁned by the direction of the propagation of the intention-to-
action wave front would be local.
The transition of the geometric past back to intentional phase would involve transformation of real
bosons to p-adic ones and is in principle possible for this option. For the ﬁrst option the transition could
occur only for real states with vanishing total quantum numbers which would make this transition
highly improbable and thus imply irreversibility.
The basic criticism is that since intentions in the proposed sense do not involve any selection, one
could argue that this picture is not enough to explain the instability of the geometric future unless
the instability is due to the instability of p-adic space-time sheets in quantum jumps.
Does intentional action transform quantum critical phase to non-quantum critical phase?
It is far from clear whether the proposed model is not able to explain the uncertainty of the geometric
future and relative stability of the geometric past related very intimately to the possibility to select
between diﬀerent options. TGD based view about dark matter as a hierarchy of phases characterized
by M 4 and CP2 Planck constants quantized in integer multiples of minimum value ℏ0 of ℏ[K24]
suggests a more reﬁned view about what happens in the quantum jump transforming intention to
action.
1. The geometric future of the living system corresponds to a quantum critical state which is a
superposition of (at least) two phases. Quantum criticality means that future is very uncertain
and universe can be in dramatically diﬀerent macroscopic quantum states.
2. Experienced ﬂow of time corresponds to a phase transition front proceeding towards the geo-
metric future quantum jump by quantum jump. In this transition intentional action represented
by negative energy bosonic signals transforms the quantum critical phase to either of the two
phases present. This selection between diﬀerent phases would be the basic element of actions
involving choice. The geometric past is stabilized so that geometric memories about geometric
past are relatively stable. This picture applies always in some time scale and there is an entire
hierarchy of time and spatial scales corresponding to the hierarchies of p-adic length scales and
of Planck constants. Note that Compton length and time are proportional to ℏas is also the
span of long term memories and time scale of planned actions.

6.2. TGD based concept of time
309
The (at least) two phases present at quantum criticality would have diﬀerent values of Planck con-
stants. In the simplest case the values of M 4 and CP2 Planck constants for the second phase would
correspond to the minimal value ℏ0 of Planck constants. For instance, cell could be in quantum super-
position of ordinary and high Tc super-conducting phase, with high Tc superconductor characterized
by a large M 4 Planck constant.
Intentional action would induce a transition to either of these two phases.
Sub-system would
chose either the lower or higher level in the hierarchy of consciousness with level characterized by
the values of Planck constants. This unavoidably brings in mind a moral choice. Intentional actions
involve often a choice between good and bad and this choice could reduce to a choice between values
of Planck constant. Good deed would lead to higher value of Planck constant and bad deed to a lower
one. This interpretation conforms with the earlier view about quantum ethics stating that good deeds
are those which support evolution. The earlier proposal was however based on the assumption that
evolution means a gradual increase of a typical p-adic length scale and seems to be too restricted in
the recent framework.
For instance, in cell length scale the cells of the geometric future could be in quantum critical phase
such that large ℏphase corresponds to high Tc super-conductivity and low ℏphase to its absence.
In quantum jump cell would transform to either of these phases. The natural interpretation for the
transition to low ℏphase is as cell death since the communications of the cell to and quantum control
by the magnetic body are lost. Ageing could be seen as a process in which the transitions to small ℏ
phase begin to dominate or even the quantum criticality is lost. A model for the quantum criticality
based on zeros of Riemann zeta developed in [K17, K79, K10] allows a more quantitative view about
what could happen in the phase transition.
6.2.7
Memory and time
Do declarative memories and intentional action involve communications with geometric
past?
Communications with geometric past using time mirror mechanism in which phase conjugate photons
propagating to the geometric past are reﬂected back as ordinary photons (typically dark photons with
energies above thermal threshold) make possible realization of declarative memories in the brain of
the geometric past [K66] .
This mechanism makes also possible realization of intentional actions as a process proceeding from
longer to shorter time scales and inducing the desired action already in geometric past. This kind
of realization would make living systems extremely ﬂexible and able to react instantaneously to the
changes in the environment. This model explains Libet’s puzzling ﬁnding that neural activity seems
to precede volition [J80] .
Also a mechanism of remote metabolism (”quantum credit card”) based on sending of negative
energy signals to geometric past becomes possible [K35] : this signal could also serve as a mere control
signal inducing much larger positive energy ﬂow from the geometric past. For instance, population
inverted system in the geometric past could allow this kind of mechanism. Remote metabolism could
also have technological implications.
Episodal memories as time-like entanglement
Time-like entanglement explains episodal memories as sharing of mental images with the brain of
geometric past [K66] .
An essential element is the notion of magnetic body which serves as an
intentional agent ”looking” the brain of geometric past by allowing phase conjugate dark photons
with negative energies to reﬂect from it as ordinary photons. The ﬁndings of Libet about time delays
related to the passive aspects of consciousness [J56] support the view that the part of the magnetic
body corresponding to EEG time scale has same size scale as Earth’s magnetosphere. The unavoidable
conclusion would be that our ﬁeld/magnetic bodies contain layers with astrophysical sizes.
p-Adic length scale hierarchy and number theoretically preferred hierarchy of values of Planck
constants, when combined with the condition that the frequencies f of photons involved with the
communications in time scale T satisfy the condition f ∼1/T and have energies above thermal
energy, lead to rather stringent predictions for the time scales of long term memory. The model for
the hierarchy of EEGs relies on the assumption that these time scales come as powers n = 211k,

310
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
k = 0, 1, 2,, and predicts that the time scale corresponding to the duration of human life cycle is ∼50
years and corresponds to k = 7 (amusingly, this corresponds to the highest level in chakra hierarchy).
6.2.8
Cosmology of consciousness
Cosmology of consciousness scenario is inspired by the notion of inﬁnite self hierarchy and by the
quantum-classical correspondence principle stating that the fractal structure of the many-sheeted
space-time should directly reﬂect the general structure for the cosmology of consciousness. For in-
stance, the p-adic evolution of consciousness should have its counterpart at space-time level: indeed,
there are good reasons to believe that 4-surfaces have decomposition into regions obeying real or ﬁnite-
p p-adic topology just like conﬁguration space has decomposition into real regions and regions DP
labelled by inﬁnite primes characterizing the appropriate functions space topology. Fractality suggests
that there are conscious universes within conscious universes and that the experiences of universes
involve kind of abstractions about the experiences of the sub-universes they contain.
Summation
hypothesis for the experiences of selves indeed states just this.
Each self corresponds geometrically to its own subset of mind like and matter like space-time
sheets, separate conscious cosmology.
Mind like space-time sheets are bounded in time direction:
the sheet of 3-space is born when a tiny energy ﬂows into the sheet from some larger sheet and dies
when this energy ﬂows back to the larger background sheet. p-Adic length scale Lp gives a ﬁrst guess
for the typical duration Tp = Lp/c of the space-time sheet.
Even human body could correspond
to mind like space-time sheet: time duration would be of order of lifetime. Note however that the
visible body might be only dip of iceberg, and it indeed seems that our magnetic body could have
size for which light life is natural unit of size. Since selves contain sub-selves with various values of
psychological time, the experiences are actually multi-time experiences with respect to both geometric
and subjective time. The most natural identiﬁcation of the psychological time is kind of center of
mass coordinate associated with the sensory selves.
If quantum entanglement in the direction of time is a relatively rare phenomenon (it is completely
absent in standard theories), entangled mind like space-time sheets correspond to nearly the same
value of time so that our conscious experience gets dominant contribution from time values around
the mean value of the time coordinate for our space-time sheet of ﬁnite duration. Entanglement in time
direction gives rise to multi-snapshot experiences which would resemble vivid long term memories.
The interpretation as genuine memories is however not correct. Rather, multi-time experiences with
contents coming from geometric past and recent are in question.
The conclusion would be that the entire 4-dimensional space-time is a living system in TGD uni-
verse: both the geometric future and past are living and participate in each moment of consciousness.
Each moment of consciousness decomposes into inﬁnite number of sub-moments of consciousness of
selves in the self hierarchy with the values of psychological time varying from zero to inﬁnity. The
value of our own psychological time of roughly 1011 years is just an accident. Entire civilizations
can live in diﬀerent geometric times without knowing anything about each other unless they happen
to have entanglement in time direction. If they have, the resulting experiences could be interpreted
as memories, dreams, religious or mystic experiences or simply as hallucinations. The inhabitants
of suﬃciently but not suﬃciently advanced sub-cosmologies tend to believe that they are the only
conscious beings in the Universe, construct their own cosmology and try desperately to understand
why the value of cosmological time happens to be what it is and, to certain degree quite correctly,
conclude that Anthropic Principle is the only explanation.
The civilizations of past could still exist and participate to each quantum jump. Also the civiliza-
tions of future coexist consciously with us. The hierarchy of selves implies that selves have increasingly
longer geometric and subjective memories. The hypothesis about inﬁnite primes implies a hierarchy
of literally inﬁnite values of psychological time and God like conscious beings with inﬁnitely long geo-
metric and subjective memories is possible if inﬁnite primes. At the top of the hierarchy is the entire
universe having inﬁnitely long geometric and subjective memories and integrating all experiences at
the lower levels of the hierarchy in single abstracted experience. Note that this picture gives hopes
to understand how universe is able to construct theory about itself. Notice also that any theory of
consciousness should be able to predict its own discovery and the inﬁnite hierarchy of selves gives
good hopes in this respect.
One can represent an objection against this picture. p-Adic-to-real phase-transition front should
be common to the entire biosphere at our level of self hierarchy at least. It is not clear in what

6.2. TGD based concept of time
311
time scale this is true and whether the geometric past can generate intentions which can eﬀectively
re-create the geometric past. If p-adic-to-real phase transition occurs in entire cosmology then one
could say that there is universal psychological time. A concrete model for p-adic cognition at neuronal
level however suggests that there is no deep reason to assume that psychological time would be more
than local. The paradoxes related to the transformation of intentions to actions in the geometric past
are avoided if the eﬀects of this nondeterminism are bounded to a time scale not longer than p-adic
length scale. This would also conform with the hypothesis that the second law of thermodynamics
holds true only in time scales longer than the p-adic length scale characterizing the space-time sheet
in question.
6.2.9
Communications in four-dimensional society
The idea about four-dimensional society makes sense only if communication between members of this
society is possible. It would be even better if communication could occur in ”real subjective time”.
This seems to be possible in principle as the following arguments show.
Communication method
A simple model for real time communication between societies of the geometric future and past is
based on the possibility of space-time sheets of negative time orientation having negative energy
density. It seems natural to assume that at least classical signals propagate from geometric future to
geometric past along these space-time sheets. As suggested in [K12, K55] ”massless extremals” could
make possible coherent motion of living systems. It seems that they could make possible also ”real
subjective time” communications in four-dimensional society.
1. Signals to the geometric future propagate along space-time sheets of positive time orientation.
These space-time sheets can correspond to ordinary material space-time sheets but also almost
vacuum space-time sheets can be considered. In particular, so called ”massless extremals” [K55]
are possible.
2. Signals to the geometric past propagate along space-time sheets of negative time orientation.
Negative energy massless extremals are the optimal choice as far as classical communication
is involved. The reason is that signal propagates with maximal signal velocity and consists of
Fourier components with same momentum direction so that the shape of pulse is preserved.
Polarization direction at a given point of the massless extremal is constant and depends on the
transversal coordinates only. Solution involves two arbitrary functions and linear superposition
of parallel Fourier components with identical polarization directions is possible. Therefore all
possible pulse shapes are possible.
3. What happens in the communication is following. Sender performs quantum jump in which
massless extremal of positive/negative energy is generated representing signal propagating to
geometric future/past.
Some standardized alphabet formed by the pulse forms for massless
extremals: two basic pulse shapes identiﬁable as binary digits is the simplest choice. Receiver
interacts with the massless extremal purely classically to receive the message and generates
a massless extremal propagating to geometric past/future as a reply. The diﬀerence between
sender and receiver is that sender performs quantum jump whereas receiver just acts purely
classically to receive the message.
4. The communication is on-line ”real subjective time” communication. There is no need to wait for
next billion years for reply and members of cultures separated by billions of light years can have
real time chat about their family problems! Also communication with eﬀective signal velocity
larger than light velocity becomes possible by using a ’radio mast’ in the geometric future able
to send past-directed signals: the mast receives a signal from the geometric past and sends it to
the second receiver in the geometric past.
Anomalies related to spinning astrophysical objects as empirical support for the idea
The proposed communication method could be regarded as mere wild science ﬁction unless there were
some empirical support for the possibility of communication from geometric future to geometric past.

312
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
In the articles [H5, H6] various anomalies related to spinning objects are reviewed. These anomalies
are discussed in [K82] . There are also anomalies related to spining astrophysical objects. Kozyrev [H4]
has conducted astronomical observations using a receiving system of a new type. These observations
have been replicated later by other groups [H3] . These anomalies give also support for the possibility
of the signal propagation backwards in time.
1. When a telescope was directed at a certain star, the detector positioned within the telescope
registered the incoming signal even if the main mirror of the telescope was shieded by metal
screens. This indicated that electromagnetic waves were accompanied by some waves not shielded
by the metal screens.
2. When the telescope was directed to the true position, the signal became stronger. As if there
had been almost instantaneous propagation of signal with velocity billions times greater than
the velocity of light!
3. When the telescope was directed to a position symmetrical with respect to the visible position,
again signal was detected: the imaginative interpretation was that the signal came from future
position of the star!
Leaving aside the objections of a typical sceptic and the question whether the eﬀect is real or not,
one can ask whether the concepts of many-sheeted space-time concept and classical Z0 ﬁeld could
somehow give rise to this kind of eﬀect in strong conﬂict with the conventional wisdom.
1. Propagating photons (extremely tiny 3-surface glued to macroscopic space-time sheet) aﬀect
the space-time sheet and could generate propagating classical Z0 ﬁeld causing the eﬀect in the
detector. Of course, one cannot exclude the possibility of negative energy photons although the
experimental arrangement eliminating the ordinary photons should eliminate also these.
2. The strong signal from the true position could have explanation in terms of a coherent classical
Z0 ﬁeld of astronomical size. This kind of coherence is forced by the imbeddability requirement
and was coined as topological ﬁeld quantization in [K36] . One can intuitively understand it
as follows. In TGD elementary particle is replaced with 3-surface, which can have arbitrarily
large size and absolution minimization of K¨ahler action forces 3-surface to behave coherently like
single particle (in case that it does not so, it decomposes into disjoint components!). The results
of Kozyrev are not the only evidence for this kind of behavior. Total eclipses of the Sun by the
Moon reach maximum eclipse about 40 seconds before Sun’s and Moon’s gravitational forces
on Earth align [H10] . If gravity is a propagating force, this 3-body test implies that gravity
propagates at least 20 times faster than light. The result is consistent with the assumption that
the acceleration of Earth is towards the true instanteous direction of the Sun now, rather than
being parallel to the direction of the arriving solar photons now. The TGD based explanation
is that the changes of the classical gravitational ﬁeld are not propagating eﬀects but that the
classical gravitational ﬁeld behaves like single coherent whole (it could of course contain also
small propagating part).
3. The signal in the symmetric position could indeed come from geometric future.
An attrac-
tive possibility is that classical Z0 ﬁeld propagated along space-time sheet with negative time
orientation: for negative time orientation the propagation is expected to occur backwards in
time.
There are also reports about the anomalies related to rotated magnetic systems in laboratory
scale and these eﬀects are under intensive study (for instance in Faraday Lab in Russia). The TGD
based explanation of the anomalies reported in [H8] is developed in [K82] .
The model involves
in an essential manner the generation of both negative energy space-time sheets and many particle
states with negative single particle energies residing at these sheets and some of the observed strange
eﬀects involved support the generation of the negative energy particles. The model allows to seriously
consider the possibility that even ordinary ions and atoms could have negative energy counterparts.

6.3. Four-dimensional brain
313
6.3
Four-dimensional brain
The paradigm of 4-dimensional brain is the most important consequence of the Grand Scenario. The
non-determinism of the K¨ahler action (non-determinism is understood here in the conventional sense of
the word) is the quintessential, purely TGD based element of the Grand Scenario: without there would
not be any evolution, the contents of conscious experience would be diﬀused around entire quantum
histories and there would be no systems with strongly time-localized contents of consciousness. A
second key element is p-adic nondeterminism making possible intentionality and cognition.
6.3.1
The paradigm of four-dimensional brain
The cosmology of consciousness implies that each conscious experience decomposes into separate sub-
experiences with the values of the psychological time varying from zero to inﬁnity.
Furthermore,
the experiences are in general multitime experiences both with respect to both geometric and sub-
jective time. This picture forces the paradigm of 4-dimensional brain having profound consequences
concerning the understanding of the brain functioning.
The diﬃcult problems related to the understanding of conscious memory recall could trivialize. No
separate mechanisms of memory storage or retrieval are needed and the diﬃcult problems related to
the interpretation of the stored memories are circumvented. There are two basic types of memories:
geometric and subjective memories. Geometric memories provide as simulation for what happened
and will happen provided no quantum jumps occur and has occurred and subjective memories tell
what actually occurred. Actual memories are indeed known to be creative reconstructions of past
and hence it seems that geometric memories are an essential part of construction. The comparison of
expectations and actuality made possible by the two memory types gives rise to the emotions involving
comparison aspect.
Subjective memory corresponds to immediate short term memory and the only possible identiﬁca-
tion of the genuine long term memories is as subjective memories at the higher level of self hierarchy,
where the time span of subjective memory is longer. One possibility is periodic wake-up of sub-selves
representing mental images and giving in this manner rise to long term memories: this requires some
kind of periodic neural activity giving rise to the same sub-self periodically. Of course, it is not at all
obvious whether long term memories are genuine! It is indeed known that long term memories are
a result of a creative process and are not reliable. This would suggest that long term memories are
actually geometric memories and are reasonably reliable because our geometric past is rather stable
under quantum jumping. Of course, we do not usually test the reliability of our long term memories
but take them as granted. The notion of mind like space-time sheet allows multitime experiences
containing simultaneous contributions from both geometric present and past and the memories of,
say, childhood could be genuine multitime experiences.
The ”averaging” associated with the subjective memory implies that volition cannot correspond to
the quantum jump occurring in the measurement of the density matrix. Rather, volitional activities
must correspond to a localization in zero modes, most naturally selections between degenerate maxima
of K¨ahler function. Besides volition associated with the motor activities, also the focusing of attention
and even the selection of premises of logical thought very probably involve this kind of selection. The
most probable function of the motor nerve pulses is the generation of multi-furcations in an initial
value sensitive system between which the choice occurs. Various motor programs correspond to various
branches of the multi-furcation. Just as sensory experience, motor activity is predicted to be a top-
down self cascade of quantum jumps starting from the level of the entire body. Each selection of
the space-time branch creates self inside which subsystems perform quantum jumps as long as self
is awake and these quantum jumps in turn lead to even smaller sub-selves: in this manner a precise
and ﬂexible coordination and control of the movement involving volition at all length scales becomes
possible whereas in the standard neuroscience picture body would act like a robot with ﬁxed motor
programs.
6.3.2
Geometric and subjective memories
TGD predicts two kinds of memories corresponding to two diﬀerent time developments. There is
deterministic (in generalized sense) geometric time development and the non-deterministic subjective

314
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
time development by quantum jumps. The memories with respect to subjective time are about previ-
ous conscious experiences and ”real” whereas geometric ”memories” are prophecies giving simulation
of geometric past and future assuming that quantum jumps do not alter the macroscopic properties
of the space-time surface.
A good visualization is following: each quantum jump represents particular geometric memory
whereas the heap of these memories gives rise to subjective memory. The comparison between ex-
pectations and reality is obviously a central part of mentality and the heap structure of conscious
experience implies that this comparison is a basic function of conscious mind not reducible to any-
thing simpler. It is wellknown that our memories involve a lot of construction and are more like
stories consistent with what we actually have experienced than actual documents of what happened.
This suggests that geometric memories, possibly constrainted by subjective memories, give rise to the
”story” about past.
6.3.3
Memories with respect to geometric time as simulations
Geometric memories are about both future and past and are predictions/simulations for what would
happen if no further quantum jumps would occur and what would have happened if no quantum jumps
had occurred in past. Geometric memories are also about past: we continually make guesses about
the sequences of events which could have led to some event and this is nothing but predicting the
geometric past. Of course, geometric memories are simulations rather than real memories. Geometric
”memories” are real in the classical limit, when the eﬀect of quantum jumps becomes negligible. In
classical physics geometric memory is all that is needed to make predictions of past and future. We can
indeed predict rather reliably what will happen in the solar system during the next decade. Also the
computational approach to mind assumes only geometric memories. p-Adic geometric memories about
future give rise to intentionality often regarded as a basic characteristic of conscious mind: beliefs,
expectations, plans, etc. can be understood in terms of the p-adic geometric memory of future.
Intentionality manifests itself in many ways: as expectations of future, planning, goals, desires,
fears, imagination, disappointments, etc.. The basic element of mentality is the comparison between
the expectations of future and what actually occurred.
In TGD framework this tension between
potential and actual can be understood. The temporal extension of the mind like space-time sheet
makes possible expectations of what happens in the future assuming that no quantum jumps occur
or at least that quantum jumps do not change the macroscopic space-time. Single quantum jump
contains information about this kind of expectations. Subjective memory in turn tells what happened
actually.
Therefore it seems natural, and this is the only possibility given the fact that it is not
possible to know anything about future quantum jumps, to assume that all aspects of intentionality
are made possible the predictions of the expected geometric future and past provided by the mind
like space-time sheest.
What is nice is that subjective memory makes it possible to compare the expectations with what
really occurred since subjective memory is kind of heap of predictions of future arranged with respect
to the value of the psychological time. The origin of at least some emotions, which often involve a
comparison of what happened and what was expected to happen, is perhaps here. It is quite well
possible that all comparisons must be realized as comparisons of the subjective and geometric time
developments (it could be that self is also able to compare its sub-selves).
The possibility of this comparison perhaps provides a solution to the paradox raised by the innocent
question ”How do I know that the me of today is the same as the me of the yesterday? How do I
even know that I existed yesterday?”. The solution might be simple: mind like space-time sheets have
extension which can be much longer than the duration of the subjective memory. Therefore subjective
memories contain information about the geometric me of the yesterday and geometric me of today
and since these me’s resemble each other quite a lot, the conclusion is that also the yesterday’s me was
a conscious self living in this same body. It is however quite possible that temporal entanglement with
higher selves still remembering my past wake-up states is also involved and realized as a formation of
join along boundaries bonds between the mind like space-time sheets of my self and of higher level
self. Higher level self could also communicate directly the subjective memories about my existence to
me.

Are long term memories geometric or subjective memories?
The answer to the question whether long term memories are geometric memories and thus only
simulations or genuine subjective memories of higher level self somehow communicated to us, is not
obvious.
Long term memories as geometric memories?
Geometric memories realized as multitime experiences involving mind like space-time sheets located
around several moments of the geometric time, provide the simplest realization for the long term
memories.
1. The model solves the basic diﬃculties of the neural net models of long term memory. In the
neural net models long term memories are represented by synaptic strengths. The problem is
that the learning of new memories destroys old memories. In particular, the stability of the
childhood memories is diﬃcult to understand. It is also hard to understand how brain knows
that the experience represents memory. One cannot avoid the diﬃculty by saying that novelty
detection tells that experience occurs for the ﬁrst time since the notion of novelty does not make
sense if conscious experience contains only information from single moment of geometric time.
2. TGD model is consistent with neural net models and actually generalizes them. Neural net in
the spirit of TGD corresponds to brain as system moving in spin glass energy landscape. Self-
organization by quantum jumps leads the system to a bottom of an energy valley representing
memory. This model is consistent with the fact that there is no upper bound for autobiographical
memory. One can also understand how learning occurs. The repetition of an experience means
that energy valley becomes a canyon in time direction so that mind like space-time sheets in
the geometric past have a large probability to end up to the region representing memory. In
particular, reverberating nerve pulse patterns are ideal for representing cognitive long term
memories.
3. Highly emotional experiences generate deep valleys and increase the probability of the system of
the geometric past to stay at the bottom of valley. This explains why cildhood experiences are
so stable. In fact, one could identify primitive emotions of pleasure and pain as related to the
motion in the spin glass energy landscape. Pleasure and pain could even directly correlate with
the sign of the increment of the K¨ahler function in the hopping motion in the spin glass energy
landscape. Note that primitive pleasure and pain are are very much like sensory experiences and
one could regard them as sensory experiences of brain about its own motion in spin glass energy
landscape. This leads to the generalization of the notions of sensory experience and motor action
to include the motion in spin glass energy landscape and to a considerably new insight about
the meaning of the brain architecture.
There are also perinatal experiences, memories about previous lives and transpersonal experiences
having natural explanation in terms of geometric memory realized as multitime experiences associated
with mind like space-time sheets located at diﬀerent values of the geometric time.
Transpersonal experiences suggests that self is dynamical: if prenatal experiences, memories about
previous lives and transpersonal experiences are really what they seem to be, the geometric time
extension of self should dramatically increase during these experiences.
Long term memories as subjective memories of higher level self?
The natural identiﬁcation of the immediate short term memory as subjective memory predicts that the
life time of a human sensory self cannot be much longer than .1 seconds, the duration of psychological
moment of time. Our long term memories correspond to much longer time interval and cannot thus
correspond to our subjective memories. Entire hierarchy of subjective memories is however predicted
and a possible model for genuine long term memories (whose existence is questionable) is as resulting
from temporary entanglement with selves belonging to the higher level of the hierarchy. Also this
identiﬁcation is consistent with the fact that there seems to be no upper bound on autobiographical
memory.

316
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
Quantum-classical correspondence principle suggests that entanglement could correspond geomet-
rically to temporary join along boundaries bonds between the mind like space-time sheets of self and
higher level self. Summation hypothesis implies that our genuine long term memories would be sums
over a large number of wake-up periods of self in the subjective past of the self. Therefore one could
perhaps understand how ageing self gains gradually wisdom from experience: also the identiﬁcation
of the long term memories as geometric memories explains this. It would seem that our self must be
able to shift the hierarchy level in order to remember details on one hand and to form abstractions
on the other hand and that the detailed memories about the wake-up periods of self are unavoidably
lost.
There are however serious counter arguments against this identiﬁcation.
1. It is not at all clear why the experiences of the higher level selves during entangled state could
be ours! For instance, during sleep without dreams entanglement with some higher level self
should occur and we do not remember anything about this. Trance is a second example of this:
subject person does not remember anything about the trance state.
2. The averaging involved with the temporal binding means that the subjective memories of the
higher level selves cannot possess the details of our long term memories.
3. It is not obvious how to understand learning and the role of emotions in learning.
The entanglement with the higher level self is not necessary to have genuine long term memories.
One could consider also the possibility that higher level self could somehow communicate the long term
memories to the lower level selves. One function of sleep might be the generation of the entanglement
with higher selves making in turn possible the communication of genuine memories of subjective past
to our mind. This communication could realize these memories as thoughts about the experiences of
past realized as nerve pulse patterns regenerating these thoughts. The lack of a precise realization of
this mechanism makes the realization of the long term memories as geometric memories much more
attractive option.
Long term memories as a communication between now and geometric past
The basic challenge is to identify concrete mechanisms of long term memory recall. According to
the idea of magnetic sensory canvas discussed in [K64] , the positions of objects of perceptive ﬁeld
are coded by the frequency scale of the magnetic transitions occurring at the magnetic ﬂux tube
structures having size of wave lengths associated with EEG frequencies. The slowly varying thickness
of the magnetic ﬂux tube codes for the position of the object of the perceptive ﬁeld.
This encourages to consider the possibility that also the temporal position of the object of percep-
tive ﬁeld could be coded in this manner. There are however two diﬃculties involved:
1. Since the time scales are of order life time T , the needed frequency resolution is ∆f/f ∼∆T/T,
if the time resolution is ∆T. This requires frequency resolutions of order ∆f/f ∼10−8 at least
and this kind of resolution is certainly not achievable in the neuronal circuits.
2. If ELF MEs (massless extremals) are involved it is diﬃcult to understand how one could cir-
cumvent the fact that the ME represents geometrically a light ray escaping from the system.
This ray should be reﬂected somewhere. Kind of mirror would be required. Magnetic ﬂux tubes
could serve as this kind of mirror and allow the radiation to travel in zigzag curve in space-time
to to geometric past.
There is however a much more elegant mechanism of long term memory recall based on MEs.
First, of all what makes MEs so interesting from the point of view of long term memories, is that light
like selves has a temporal extension, which can be arbitrary long in given rest system. Secondly, the
pairs of MEs resulting when ME reﬂects from some structure such as magnetic ﬂux tube structure
serving as a mirror, provide a TGD based model of long term memories relying on the idea that long
term memory recall involves a ’question’ sent to the geometric past as a classical signal reﬂected back
to brain in a magnetic mirror, and a subsequent quantum entanglement in which the selves of the
geometric past and now as well as ME selves entangle to single self so that the self of the geometric now
can share the experience of the self of the geometric past. What is so elegant in this mechanism is that

6.4. Time delays of consciousness and quantum jumps between histories
317
there is no necessity of sending the information as a classical signal, only the time like entanglement
is needed. In this case the MEs would have a length of order lifetime so that long term memories
would be astrophysical phenomena involving magnetic ﬂux tube structures and MEs. The temporal
location T of the memory (or rather, shared conscious event) of the geometric past would be coded
by the length L of ME: L = cT/2. The TGD based notion of time indeed allows geometric time scales
of order lifetime to be involved with subjective experiences in psychological time scale of a fraction of
second. Certainly this mechanism is completely out of question in standard physics.
6.4
Time delays of consciousness and quantum jumps between
histories
TGD based concept of time has rather dramatic implications and it would be important to show
that the new time concept indeed solves conceptual problems and anomalies. One should also device
experiments to test the new time concept. Dissipation is the black sheep in the family of theoretical
physics and quantum jump between quantum histories concept explains dissipation in elegant manner.
Quantum jumps between quantum histories concept together with the notion of self explains also the
peculiar time delays of consciousness revealed in the experiments relating to the active and passive
roles of consciousness [J56, J80] and described by Penrose in his book [J95] . It is also possible to
explain the causal anomalies revealed by the experiments of Radin and Bierman [J31, J32, J112] .
TGD predicts ”tribar eﬀect” as a general signature for the quantum jump between quantum histories
concept.
6.4.1
Dissipation as evidence for consciousness
TGD based picture about time relies crucially on the notion that quantum jumps occur between
quantum histories, objective realities. This hypothesis obviously means giving up the materialistic
idea about single objective reality behind our experiences. It took quite long time to realize that our
everyday experiences reveals directly the occurrence of quantum jumps between quantum histories!
The phenomenon of dissipation is paradoxical from the point of view of standard physics.
It is
generally believed that fundamental laws of classical physics are reversible whereas everyday reality
is manifestly irreversible. This leads to a rather schizophrenic situation. Two worlds, the reversible
and extremely beautiful world of fundamental physics and the irreversible and the mathematically
horribly ugly ”real” world, seem to exist simultaneously. Quantum jumps between quantum histories
concept solves the paradox and one can understand dissipative world as an eﬀective description forming
”almost” envelope for the sequence of reversible worlds (understood as entire time evolutions).
Dissipation can be also regarded as a direct evidence for the presence of the self hierarchy. One
can imagine quite spectacular tests for the idea. NMP predicts that self can be in two modes of
consciousness: quantum jumps reduce either matter-mind like entanglement or reduced matter+mind-
matter+mind type entanglement leading to an unentangled subsystem giving rise to two new self
candidates (sub-system and its complement inside self). The ﬁrst mode corresponds to ”whole-body”
consciousness and in this mode matter-mind like dissipation in short length scales should be completely
absent. The lowered dissipation should reﬂect itself as lowered metabolism. The measurement of
cell level dissipation occurred during meditative states could provide a test for this picture. TGD
explanation for the phenomenon of synesthesia [J48] discussed in [K70] relies on the hypothesis that
left brain or considerable parts of it get quantum entangled and spends part of time in ”whole-body
consciousness”. Indeed, synesthesia can involve lowering of left brain metabolism by as much 18 per
cent [J48] : this should lead to paralysis if standard wisdom about brain functioning would hold true!
6.4.2
Experiments related to the active role of consciousness
The ﬁrst class of experiments [J80] is related to the active role of consciousness. For example, the
human subject ﬂexes his ﬁnger at free will. What happens is that neurophysiological processes (changes
in EEG) start about one second before the conscious decision to ﬂex the ﬁnger is made. Decision seems
to be followed by the action rather than the action by decision! This is in apparent accordance with
the point of view that consciousness is indeed a passive spectator and the act of free will is pure
illusion.

318
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
Quantum jump between histories picture explains the time delays associated with the active aspect
of consciousness nicely and also gives an example of two kinds of causalities.
1. The simplest assumption is that the subjective experience of the ﬁnger ﬂexing corresponds to
the moment, when subject person experiences ﬁnger ﬂexing occurs.
2. The new quantum history diﬀers in detectable manner from the old quantum history already
before the moment of ﬁnger ﬂexing since otherwise the new history would contain an instanta-
neous and discontinuous jump from non-ﬂexed ﬁnger to ﬂexed ﬁnger conﬁguration, which is not
allowed by ﬁeld equations. ∆T of order one second seems to be the relevant time scale. It is
important to notice that the diﬀerence is at the level of classical physics rather than, say, in the
form of synchronous neural ﬁring which might involve quantum jumps of lower level selves: in
TGD framework EEG activity is indeed classical phenomenon.
3. The attempt of the experimenter to be objective means that in an ideal experiment the obser-
vations correspond to the new deterministic history in the associated quantum jump and hence
experimenter sees neurophysiological processes as the (apparent) cause of the ﬁnger ﬂexing with
respect to geometric time. With respect to the subjective time the cause of the ﬁnger ﬂexing is
the decision of the subject person.
4. This explanation is based on the hypothesis that volitional actions are top-down actions starting
from the level of the entire body. A less radical variant of this argument is that the time associ-
ated with the conscious decision to ﬂex the ﬁnger corresponds to a discontinuous conﬁgurational
change at the level of brain: the jump from non-ﬂexed to ﬂexed conﬁguration would occur at
the representational level and induce continuous ﬂexing of ﬁnger. This does not however change
the core of the argument.
6.4.3
Experiments related to the passive role of consciousness
Libet’s experiments [J56] about the strange time delays related to the passive aspects of consciousness
serve as a continual source of inspiration and headache. Every time one reads again about these
experiments, one feels equally confused and must start explanations from scratch.
The following
explanation is based on the model of the sensory representations on the magnetic canvas outside the
body and having size measured by typical EEG wave lengths [K64] .
The basic argument leading to this model is the observation that although our brain changes its
position and orientation, the mental image of the external world is not experienced to move: as if we
were looking some kind of sensory canvas inside cortex from outside so that the motion of canvas does
not matter. Or equivalently: the ultimate sensory representation is outside brain at a ﬁxed sensory
canvas. In this model the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld are represented on the magnetic canvas. The
direction of the object is coded by the direction of ME located on brain whereas its distance is coded
by the dominating frequency of ME which corresponds to a magnetic transition frequency which varies
along the radial magnetic ﬂux tubes slowly so that place coding by magnetic frequency results.
According to the summary of Penrose in his book ’Emperor’s New Mind’ these experiments tell
the following.
1. With respect to the psychological time of the external observer subject person becomes conscious
about the electric stimulation of skin in about .5 seconds. This leaves a considerable amount of
time for the construction of the sensory representations.
2. What is important is that subject person feels no time delay. For instance she can tell the time
clock shows when the stimulus starts. This can be understood if the sensory representation
which is basically a geometric memory takes care that the clock of the memory shows correct
time: this requires backwards referral of about .5 seconds. Visual and tactile sensory inputs enter
into cortex essentially simultaneously so that this is possible. The projection to the magnetic
canvas and the generation of the magnetic quantum phase transition might quite well explain
the time lapse of .5 seconds.
3. One can combine an electric stimulation of skin with the stimulation of the cortex. The electric
stimulation of the cortex requires a duration longer than .5 seconds to become conscious. This

6.4. Time delays of consciousness and quantum jumps between histories
319
suggests that the cortical mental image (sub-self) is created only after this critical period of
stimulation. A possible explanation is that there stimulation generates quantum phase transition
”waking up” the mental image so that threshold is involved.
4. If the stimulation of the cortex begins (with respect to the psychological time of the observer)
for not more than .5 seconds before the stimulation of the skin starts, both the stimulation of
the skin and cortex are experienced separately but their time ordering is experienced as being
reversed!
A crucial question is whether the ordering is changed with respect to the subjective or geometric
time of the subject person. If the ordering is with respect to the subjective time of the subject
person, as it seems, the situation becomes puzzling.
The only possibility seems to be that
the cortical stimulus generates a sensory mental image about touch only after it has lasted for
.5 seconds.
In TGD framework sensory qualia are at the level of of sensory organs so that
the sensation of touch requires back-projection from cortex to the skin. If the formation of
back projection would takes about .5 seconds the observations can be understood. Genuine
sensory stimulus creates cortical mental image almost immediately: this mental image is then
communicated to magnetic body (time like entanglement).
5. If the stimulation of the cortex begins in the interval T ∈[25 −.5] seconds after the stimulation
of the skin, the latter is not consciously perceived. This eﬀect - known as backward masking
- looks really mysterious. It would be interesting to know whether also in this case there is a
lapse of .5 seconds before the cortical stimulation is felt.
According to the TGD based vision sensory mental images are at the level of sensory organs
and brain constructs symbolic representations about them using intensive back-projections to
the sensory organs. These representations give rise to a decomposition of the perceptive ﬁeld to
standardized sensory mental images. The most eﬀective manner to achieve back-projection is
by using negative energy signals propagating backwards in geometric time just like in the case
of intentional action. Accepting this framework one can at least make questions.
i) Could the stimulation of the cortex induce a negative energy back-projection signal to the
skin representing a stimulus eﬀectively interfering to zero with the real stimulus?
That the
skin stimulus is perceived consciously for T < .25 seconds means that the compensating back
projection is sent only if cortex has received information about skin stimulation. One can imagine
that it takes .25 seconds to form a symbolic representation about the sensory mental images at
sensory organ. Why the back-projection would compensate the skin stimulus?
It is known that brain acts like a highly selective gardener applying strong inhibition to certain
sensory stimuli and strong excitation to others in order to build percepts. If this principle applies
also in time domain - as it should if the paradigm of 4-D brain is accepted- the elimination of
the sensory stimulus could be seen as a tendency to build sensory percepts which are sharply
localized in time.
A precise localization in time is indeed important in the case of sensory
percepts.
Second explanation would be based on compensating back-projection. Everyone who has been
swimming in windy sea, feels the waves for a long time after coming to the shore. This sensation
would correspond to back-projection in TGD framework but it is not clear to me whether this
back-projection tends to compensate the actual sensation in order to achieve metabolic economy.
ii) Could it be that the skin stimulus is actually consciously perceived but that this experience
is not remembered? In TGD framework the memory about skin stimulus would be realized as a
skin stimulus still continuing in the geometric past. If the cortical stimulation for some reason
modiﬁes the geometric past by destroying the skin stimulus using back-projection, there would
be no memory about the skin stimulus.
1. Two options for the communications to the magnetic canvas
Consider now possible constraints from Libet’s experiments on the model of sensory representations
based on the notion of magnetic canvas. MEs induce magnetic quantum phase transitions via the
classical magnetic ﬁeld associated with them and oscillating with a multiple of the cyclotron frequency.
There are two possibilities.

320
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
1) The classical signal is thought to propagate along an existing em ME to the magnetic canvas
and induces the magnetic quantum phase transition.
2) MEs behave like topological ﬁeld quanta. A passive Z0 ME is replaced with a an active em ME in
single quantum jump so that the signal propagates to the magnetic canvas eﬀectively instantaneously.
2. Various time lapses involved
Let us ﬁrst analyze various time lapses which can be involved in the process leading from the
sensory stimulus to the sensory experience.
1. The propagation of the classical signal along ME to the magnetic sensory canvas takes some time.
This gives upper bound for the possible sizes L of MEs. The lapse is however for Tcl ∼L/c = 1/f,
which is about .1 seconds for earth-sized MEs and of same order as the time lapse Tb ≃.01
seconds due to the conduction of the nerve pulses from skin to somatosensory cortex.
2. The time Tm for the magnetic quantum phase transition to occur should be Tm ∼1/Γ, where Γ is
the rate Γ for cyclotron transitions for ions in the harmonic perturbation deﬁned by the classical
magnetic ﬁeld B associated with ME. If the magnetic quantum transitions occur incoherently,
Golden Rule implies that the rate Γ should be of order
Γ ∼N(B2
Be
)2fc ,
where B is the amplitude of the oscillating magnetic ﬁeld associated with ME, Be is Earth’s mag-
netic ﬁeld, fc is the corresponding cyclotron frequency, and N is the number of ions participating
in the transition.
If Tm indeed represents a lapse of conscious experience then the magnetic ﬁeld associated with the
radial ME inducing the magnetic quantum phase transition should be very strong as compared
with the typical intensities in MEG unless N is large. The relative intensity of the ﬂuctuations
of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is about ∆B/Be ∼10−8 and gives an estimate for the intensity of
B. The lower bound for the number of ions participating to the quantum phase transition is
N = 1016. Since the magnetic ﬂux tube has thickness of order cell size, and since there are not
much more than about 102 ions per cellular volume, the required length of the magnetic ﬂux
tube participating in the quantum transition would be longer than 108 meters and is deﬁnitely
too long.
Quantum coherence can however come in rescue here. If the magnetic transitions occur coher-
ently, the rate is given by
Γ ∼N 2(B2
Be
)2fc ,
where N is the number of the ions participating in the transitions. For N > Be/B (∼108
for B ∼10−8Be) the rate is high enough if the length of the magnetic ﬂux tube participating
in which quantum phase transition occurs longer than 102 meters. Since the intensity of the
magnetic ﬁeld varies extremely slowly along the magnetic ﬂux tube in the proposed model, the
number of the ions participating the transition could indeed be large enough and Tm would
become an unimportant factor.
3. The total lapse of time is T = Tb + Tcl + Tm + Tp, where Tb ∼.01 seconds is the time for the
signal to propagate to the somatosensory area and Tp is the time used by cortex to estimate the
position of the sensory stimulus and activate the MEs taking care of the sensory projection to
the magnetic canvas. Since the coding of the position of skin is topographic, there is no need
to compute the distance and orientation of the stimulus and one has Tp is minimal. This gives
T = Tb + Tcl + Tm + Tp for the classical option 1) and T = Tb + Tm + Tp for the quantum option
2).
3. Constraints from Libet’s experiments

6.4. Time delays of consciousness and quantum jumps between histories
321
It is interesting to look what Libet’s experiments mean for various options about what precedes
the magnetic quantum phase transition giving rise to the sensory experience. The basic observation
is that the classical signal propagation time along ME, which is .1 seconds for magnetic ﬂux tube at
distance of order Earth circumference, is much shorter than the time .5 seconds between the sensory
stimulus and conscious experience. Thus it does not strong constraints on the model based on option
1).
1. If one assumes that the formation of the sensory representations involves the propagation of a
classical signals along MEs (option 1)), and that the sensory representation of the skin is at
distance of, say, one fourth of Eearth’s radius corresponding to the frequency f = 10 Hz, the
lapse is about T ≃Tb + Tcl + Tm + Tp = .1 + Tm seconds. This allows Tm + Tp ≃.4 seconds. For
Tm ≪Tb Tp ≃.4 seconds is allowed. In classical case there are however bounds on the distance
of the magnetic canvas, ﬁve Earth circumferences is the upper bound.
2. Second option is that the process does not involve classical signalling in the proposed sense so
that the distance of magnetic canvas does not matter at all. ME behaves as a single particle and
is transformed from passive Z0 ME to active em ME in single quantum jump. Suppose the arrival
of the neuronal signal induced by the electrical stimulation of the skin to the somatosensory area
induces this kind of quantum jump, which becomes thus capable of inducing magnetic quantum
phase transition. If this is the case, then the sensory representation of the stimulus could result
after T ∼Tb + Tm + Tp after the arrival of the neural signal to the cortex. If Tm is negligible
one has T ≃Tp ≃.5 seconds. The fact that the stimulation of cortex by .5 seconds is needed to
produce artiﬁcially the sensory stimulus suggests that Tm is indeed negligible.
3. The third option is that there is a ME associated with the entire sensory pathway fused with
the ME associated with the sensory projection to the magnetic canvas and that already the
sensory stimulus at the skin initiates the magnetic quantum phase transition. In this case one
has T = Tm ≃.5 seconds.
6.4.4
The experiment of Radin and Bierman as evidence for quantum jump
between quantum histories concept
The experiments of Radin [J112] and the later experiments by Radin and Bierman [J31, J32] gave
evidence for anomalous unconscious emotional responses preceding their cause. Radin monitored the
sympathetic and parasympathetic behavior of the autonomic nervous system with skin conductance,
heart rate and ﬁngertip blood volume measurements. Subjects were asked to look at a computer
monitor and press a button to start a trial. Button press caused the display of a blank screen for ﬁve
seconds, then a randomly selected calm or emotional picture was shown for three seconds, and this
was followed by ten seconds of a blank screen. In three studies, Radin found signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
autonomic physiology, most notably skin conductance, preceding the exposure of emotional vs. calm
pictures. Radin examined a number of possible normal explanations for the result and concluded that
they did not apply.
Radin and Bierman interpreted the result of the experiment as evidence for a reversal of the arrow
of time. The constancy of the arrow of psychological time is by no means obvious in TGD Universe
and one of the basic challenges of TGD inspired theory of consciousness is to understand how the
(probably statistical) arrow of psychological time emerges. Moment of consciousness as quantum jump
between quantum histories concept provides however an elegant explanation of the eﬀect without any
need to assume the reversal of the arrow of psychological time. What is important that one can
also avoid the poorly deﬁned concept of eﬀects propagating backwards in time, which is needed in
explanations based on quantum state as time=constant snapshot concept.
Consider now the TGD based explanation. In quantum jump deterministic quantum history is
replaced with a new one: this means that, not only the future, but also the past changes. Therefore,
if the mean galvanic skin response of the subject person provides a faithful representation for some
aspects of subject person’s deterministic quantum history, the entire time record about skin response
must change to a new one in any quantum jump. If subject person experiences a highly emotional
stimulus, the moment of consciousness is expected to be more intensive than for calm stimulus in the
sense that the non-determinism associated with the quantum jump is expected to cause observable
eﬀects in a larger space-time volume of the quantum history (represented to a good approximation as

322
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
quantum average space-time surface geometrically). Therefore also the change of the quantum past
is expected to be more dramatic as it indeed seems to be according to the results of the experiment.
At ﬁrst it might seem that there are no means to test whether the past has changed at the
moment of consciousness. The experimental arrangement of Bierman and Radin, although certainly
not originally planned to test quantum jumps between histories concept, circumvents in an ingenious
manner this diﬃculty by comparing the skin responses associated with calm and emotional trials.
Standard physics, which is based on assumption that there is no signal propagation backwards in
time, predicts that the average skin responses before the stimulus should be identical for calm and
emotial trials. This is not the case so that the results of the experiments indeed support TGD based
world view.
One can in fact imagine even more dramatic test based on a modiﬁcation of Radin-Bierman
experiment. In quantum-mind discussion group Stan Klein [J77] suggested a modiﬁcation of Radin-
Bierman experiment [J31, J32, J112] providing a test for Stapp’s and Sarfatti’s theories of conscious-
ness [J124, J1] . One could perhaps consider the following further modiﬁcation of Radin-Bierman
experiment so that it would simultaneously discriminate between Stapp’s and Sarfatti’s theories and
TGD.
1. It might be possible for computer to perform a comparison of the presponse with average calm
and emotional presponses before the subject person A sees the picture and, depending on whether
the presponse is nearer to calm or emotional average presponse, to print C or E to a computer
screen such that the printing result is seen by person B before A sees the picture.
2. The theories explaining phenomenon in terms of eﬀects propagating backwards in time (say
Sarfatti’s theory [J1] ) would predict that computer record and the sequence of letters remem-
bered by B are identical and contain both C:s and E:s. According to [J77] Stapp’s theory would
predict that both computer record and B’s memories contain only C:s.
3. TGD predicts that B would see only C:s. The concept of subjective memory implies that B also
remembers of seing only C:s whereas computer records would contain both C:s and E:s. This
would provide dramatic support for quantum jump between quantum histories concept and for
the notion of subjective memory.
In TGD framework one can also consider an alternative explanation for the result of Radin-Bierman
experiment. If this explanation is correct, the report of B is consistent with the computer record just
as in Sarfatti’s theory. The argument goes as follows.
1. Given moment of consciousness contains several irreducible subexperiences besides the experi-
ence corresponding to the ”real I”, which presumably corresponds to ”I” able to communicate
using language and possessing long term memories. These ”I”:s are usually collectively identiﬁed
as subconscious mind. The phenomenon of blind sight and related phenomena [?] give support
for the idea that there is second ”I”, most naturally at the same level of self hierarchy. One can
even imagine entire population of selves at some lower level of self hirarchy giving rise to ”Zombi
within us” or shortly Z. In the latter case the response of Z is dictated by statistical determinism
at the level of ensemble. Deterministic response has deﬁnite value in ﬁght for survival.
2. The values of the psychological times associated with these various ”I”:s need not be same in
given quantum jump. Suppose that Z has psychological time slightly larger than the psycholog-
ical time of the ordinary ”I” so that Z sees the state of the world at time t + ∆t whereas ”the
real I” sees it at time t in given quantum jump. The order of magnitude for ∆t is roughly one
second. Assume further that Z is able to assign emotional content to the picture. If the decision
about what picture is shown is purely mechanical involving no quantum jump (and hence only
eﬀectively random) then Z can perceive the picture before the ordinary ”I” perceives it with the
result that galvanic presponse is created. Galvanic presponse is deterministic in case that Z is
an entire population of ”I”:s.
Some remarks about the model are in order.
1. The criticism against this kind of model is that Z is perhaps not able to assign any emotional
content to the pictures. The experiments supporting the existence of Z mildly suggest that Z

6.5. Time delays of consciousness and quantum jumps between histories
323
sees the things ”as they are” (for instance Z cannot be fooled by visual illusions) which in turn
suggests that emotional response is perhaps not involved.
2. Z could also receive the information about the picture by precognition in principle made possible
by the diﬀuse contribution to the contents of conscious experience coming from entire initial and
ﬁnal quantum histories. If this is the mechanism, one can however wonder why the ”real” I is
not capable to same so that also ”real” ”I” would have conscious experience about the nature
of the picture before seing it.
3. In case of Kornhuber experiments similar explanation would lead to the veto model: the con-
scious decision to raise index ﬁnger is preceded by the conscious decision of Z to raise it and the
”real I” can decide whether to allow various neural processes to continue or not.
4. In principle (probably only in principle) one could test the model by allowing the selection of
the ﬁgure to be shown to A be determined by a quantum jump rather than by deterministic
process. If this quantum jump occurs only very short time before A sees the picture, response
should disappear.
An eﬀect resembling Radin-Bierman eﬀect might occur in much more conrete situation. There is a
legend about the ability of the short distance runners to anticipate the shot of the starting pistol and
start already before the gun shot. Perhaps this really occurs but in the following sense. When short
distance runners hear the shot they perform a quantum jump to a new history. For obvious reasons
they might have developed a skill to jump to a quantum history at which they started before the
gun shot. Whether this eﬀect occurs could be tested by using video camera or some more sophicated
arrangement (gun shot can be accompanied or even replaced by light signal to make the timing
precise). What could happen is that the man with the gun honestly claims that the runner started
after the shot whereas videocamera tells that runner started before the shot. This eﬀect deserves the
nickname ”tribar eﬀect” (tribar is the famous nonexisting triangle like structure formed from three
bars): in its various forms the eﬀect could provide very general hard evidence for TGD based view
about space-time.
Notice that the paradox of ping pong game described in the book of Penrose [J95] can be resolved
in quantum jumps between quantum histories picture. The problem is that the time delays of con-
sciousness are so long that no conscious action seems to be possible in ping pong game. The resolution
is simple. The players can quite well miss the ball time on the old history but perform a jump to a
new history: on this history they do not miss the ball thanks to the rapid deterministic reﬂex action.
6.5
Time delays of consciousness and quantum jumps between
histories
TGD based concept of time has rather dramatic implications and it would be important to show
that the new time concept indeed solves conceptual problems and anomalies. One should also device
experiments to test the new time concept. Dissipation is the black sheep in the family of theoretical
physics and quantum jump between quantum histories concept explains dissipation in elegant manner.
Quantum jumps between quantum histories concept together with the notion of self explains also the
peculiar time delays of consciousness revealed in the experiments relating to the active and passive
roles of consciousness [J56, J80] and described by Penrose in his book [J95] . It is also possible to
explain the causal anomalies revealed by the experiments of Radin and Bierman [J31, J32, J112] .
TGD predicts ”tribar eﬀect” as a general signature for the quantum jump between quantum histories
concept.
6.5.1
Dissipation as evidence for consciousness
TGD based picture about time relies crucially on the notion that quantum jumps occur between
quantum histories, objective realities. This hypothesis obviously means giving up the materialistic
idea about single objective reality behind our experiences. It took quite long time to realize that our
everyday experiences reveals directly the occurrence of quantum jumps between quantum histories!
The phenomenon of dissipation is paradoxical from the point of view of standard physics.
It is

324
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
generally believed that fundamental laws of classical physics are reversible whereas everyday reality
is manifestly irreversible. This leads to a rather schizophrenic situation. Two worlds, the reversible
and extremely beautiful world of fundamental physics and the irreversible and the mathematically
horribly ugly ”real” world, seem to exist simultaneously. Quantum jumps between quantum histories
concept solves the paradox and one can understand dissipative world as an eﬀective description forming
”almost” envelope for the sequence of reversible worlds (understood as entire time evolutions).
Dissipation can be also regarded as a direct evidence for the presence of the self hierarchy. One
can imagine quite spectacular tests for the idea. NMP predicts that self can be in two modes of
consciousness: quantum jumps reduce either matter-mind like entanglement or reduced matter+mind-
matter+mind type entanglement leading to an unentangled subsystem giving rise to two new self
candidates (sub-system and its complement inside self). The ﬁrst mode corresponds to ”whole-body”
consciousness and in this mode matter-mind like dissipation in short length scales should be completely
absent. The lowered dissipation should reﬂect itself as lowered metabolism. The measurement of
cell level dissipation occurred during meditative states could provide a test for this picture. TGD
explanation for the phenomenon of synesthesia [J48] discussed in [K70] relies on the hypothesis that
left brain or considerable parts of it get quantum entangled and spends part of time in ”whole-body
consciousness”. Indeed, synesthesia can involve lowering of left brain metabolism by as much 18 per
cent [J48] : this should lead to paralysis if standard wisdom about brain functioning would hold true!
6.5.2
Experiments related to the active role of consciousness
The ﬁrst class of experiments [J80] is related to the active role of consciousness. For example, the
human subject ﬂexes his ﬁnger at free will. What happens is that neurophysiological processes (changes
in EEG) start about one second before the conscious decision to ﬂex the ﬁnger is made. Decision seems
to be followed by the action rather than the action by decision! This is in apparent accordance with
the point of view that consciousness is indeed a passive spectator and the act of free will is pure
illusion.
Quantum jump between histories picture explains the time delays associated with the active aspect
of consciousness nicely and also gives an example of two kinds of causalities.
1. The simplest assumption is that the subjective experience of the ﬁnger ﬂexing corresponds to
the moment, when subject person experiences ﬁnger ﬂexing occurs.
2. The new quantum history diﬀers in detectable manner from the old quantum history already
before the moment of ﬁnger ﬂexing since otherwise the new history would contain an instanta-
neous and discontinuous jump from non-ﬂexed ﬁnger to ﬂexed ﬁnger conﬁguration, which is not
allowed by ﬁeld equations. ∆T of order one second seems to be the relevant time scale. It is
important to notice that the diﬀerence is at the level of classical physics rather than, say, in the
form of synchronous neural ﬁring which might involve quantum jumps of lower level selves: in
TGD framework EEG activity is indeed classical phenomenon.
3. The attempt of the experimenter to be objective means that in an ideal experiment the obser-
vations correspond to the new deterministic history in the associated quantum jump and hence
experimenter sees neurophysiological processes as the (apparent) cause of the ﬁnger ﬂexing with
respect to geometric time. With respect to the subjective time the cause of the ﬁnger ﬂexing is
the decision of the subject person.
4. This explanation is based on the hypothesis that volitional actions are top-down actions starting
from the level of the entire body. A less radical variant of this argument is that the time associ-
ated with the conscious decision to ﬂex the ﬁnger corresponds to a discontinuous conﬁgurational
change at the level of brain: the jump from non-ﬂexed to ﬂexed conﬁguration would occur at
the representational level and induce continuous ﬂexing of ﬁnger. This does not however change
the core of the argument.
6.5.3
Experiments related to the passive role of consciousness
Libet’s experiments [J56] about the strange time delays related to the passive aspects of consciousness
serve as a continual source of inspiration and headache. Every time one reads again about these

6.5. Time delays of consciousness and quantum jumps between histories
325
experiments, one feels equally confused and must start explanations from scratch.
The following
explanation is based on the model of the sensory representations on the magnetic canvas outside the
body and having size measured by typical EEG wave lengths [K64] .
The basic argument leading to this model is the observation that although our brain changes its
position and orientation, the mental image of the external world is not experienced to move: as if we
were looking some kind of sensory canvas inside cortex from outside so that the motion of canvas does
not matter. Or equivalently: the ultimate sensory representation is outside brain at a ﬁxed sensory
canvas. In this model the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld are represented on the magnetic canvas. The
direction of the object is coded by the direction of ME located on brain whereas its distance is coded
by the dominating frequency of ME which corresponds to a magnetic transition frequency which varies
along the radial magnetic ﬂux tubes slowly so that place coding by magnetic frequency results.
According to the summary of Penrose in his book ’Emperor’s New Mind’ these experiments tell
the following.
1. With respect to the psychological time of the external observer subject person becomes conscious
about the electric stimulation of skin in about .5 seconds. This leaves a considerable amount of
time for the construction of the sensory representations.
2. What is important is that subject person feels no time delay. For instance she can tell the time
clock shows when the stimulus starts. This can be understood if the sensory representation
which is basically a geometric memory takes care that the clock of the memory shows correct
time: this requires backwards referral of about .5 seconds. Visual and tactile sensory inputs enter
into cortex essentially simultaneously so that this is possible. The projection to the magnetic
canvas and the generation of the magnetic quantum phase transition might quite well explain
the time lapse of .5 seconds.
3. One can combine an electric stimulation of skin with the stimulation of the cortex. The electric
stimulation of the cortex requires a duration longer than .5 seconds to become conscious. This
suggests that the cortical mental image (sub-self) is created only after this critical period of
stimulation. A possible explanation is that there stimulation generates quantum phase transition
”waking up” the mental image so that threshold is involved.
4. If the stimulation of the cortex begins (with respect to the psychological time of the observer)
for not more than .5 seconds before the stimulation of the skin starts, both the stimulation of
the skin and cortex are experienced separately but their time ordering is experienced as being
reversed!
A crucial question is whether the ordering is changed with respect to the subjective or geometric
time of the subject person. If the ordering is with respect to the subjective time of the subject
person, as it seems, the situation becomes puzzling.
The only possibility seems to be that
the cortical stimulus generates a sensory mental image about touch only after it has lasted for
.5 seconds.
In TGD framework sensory qualia are at the level of of sensory organs so that
the sensation of touch requires back-projection from cortex to the skin. If the formation of
back projection would takes about .5 seconds the observations can be understood. Genuine
sensory stimulus creates cortical mental image almost immediately: this mental image is then
communicated to magnetic body (time like entanglement).
5. If the stimulation of the cortex begins in the interval T ∈[25 −.5] seconds after the stimulation
of the skin, the latter is not consciously perceived. This eﬀect - known as backward masking
- looks really mysterious. It would be interesting to know whether also in this case there is a
lapse of .5 seconds before the cortical stimulation is felt.
According to the TGD based vision sensory mental images are at the level of sensory organs
and brain constructs symbolic representations about them using intensive back-projections to
the sensory organs. These representations give rise to a decomposition of the perceptive ﬁeld to
standardized sensory mental images. The most eﬀective manner to achieve back-projection is
by using negative energy signals propagating backwards in geometric time just like in the case
of intentional action. Accepting this framework one can at least make questions.
i) Could the stimulation of the cortex induce a negative energy back-projection signal to the
skin representing a stimulus eﬀectively interfering to zero with the real stimulus?
That the

326
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
skin stimulus is perceived consciously for T < .25 seconds means that the compensating back
projection is sent only if cortex has received information about skin stimulation. One can imagine
that it takes .25 seconds to form a symbolic representation about the sensory mental images at
sensory organ. Why the back-projection would compensate the skin stimulus?
It is known that brain acts like a highly selective gardener applying strong inhibition to certain
sensory stimuli and strong excitation to others in order to build percepts. If this principle applies
also in time domain - as it should if the paradigm of 4-D brain is accepted- the elimination of
the sensory stimulus could be seen as a tendency to build sensory percepts which are sharply
localized in time.
A precise localization in time is indeed important in the case of sensory
percepts.
Second explanation would be based on compensating back-projection. Everyone who has been
swimming in windy sea, feels the waves for a long time after coming to the shore. This sensation
would correspond to back-projection in TGD framework but it is not clear to me whether this
back-projection tends to compensate the actual sensation in order to achieve metabolic economy.
ii) Could it be that the skin stimulus is actually consciously perceived but that this experience
is not remembered? In TGD framework the memory about skin stimulus would be realized as a
skin stimulus still continuing in the geometric past. If the cortical stimulation for some reason
modiﬁes the geometric past by destroying the skin stimulus using back-projection, there would
be no memory about the skin stimulus.
1. Two options for the communications to the magnetic canvas
Consider now possible constraints from Libet’s experiments on the model of sensory representations
based on the notion of magnetic canvas. MEs induce magnetic quantum phase transitions via the
classical magnetic ﬁeld associated with them and oscillating with a multiple of the cyclotron frequency.
There are two possibilities.
1) The classical signal is thought to propagate along an existing em ME to the magnetic canvas
and induces the magnetic quantum phase transition.
2) MEs behave like topological ﬁeld quanta. A passive Z0 ME is replaced with a an active em ME in
single quantum jump so that the signal propagates to the magnetic canvas eﬀectively instantaneously.
2. Various time lapses involved
Let us ﬁrst analyze various time lapses which can be involved in the process leading from the
sensory stimulus to the sensory experience.
1. The propagation of the classical signal along ME to the magnetic sensory canvas takes some time.
This gives upper bound for the possible sizes L of MEs. The lapse is however for Tcl ∼L/c = 1/f,
which is about .1 seconds for earth-sized MEs and of same order as the time lapse Tb ≃.01
seconds due to the conduction of the nerve pulses from skin to somatosensory cortex.
2. The time Tm for the magnetic quantum phase transition to occur should be Tm ∼1/Γ, where Γ is
the rate Γ for cyclotron transitions for ions in the harmonic perturbation deﬁned by the classical
magnetic ﬁeld B associated with ME. If the magnetic quantum transitions occur incoherently,
Golden Rule implies that the rate Γ should be of order
Γ ∼N(B2
Be
)2fc ,
where B is the amplitude of the oscillating magnetic ﬁeld associated with ME, Be is Earth’s mag-
netic ﬁeld, fc is the corresponding cyclotron frequency, and N is the number of ions participating
in the transition.
If Tm indeed represents a lapse of conscious experience then the magnetic ﬁeld associated with the
radial ME inducing the magnetic quantum phase transition should be very strong as compared
with the typical intensities in MEG unless N is large. The relative intensity of the ﬂuctuations
of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is about ∆B/Be ∼10−8 and gives an estimate for the intensity of
B. The lower bound for the number of ions participating to the quantum phase transition is
N = 1016. Since the magnetic ﬂux tube has thickness of order cell size, and since there are not

6.5. Time delays of consciousness and quantum jumps between histories
327
much more than about 102 ions per cellular volume, the required length of the magnetic ﬂux
tube participating in the quantum transition would be longer than 108 meters and is deﬁnitely
too long.
Quantum coherence can however come in rescue here. If the magnetic transitions occur coher-
ently, the rate is given by
Γ ∼N 2(B2
Be
)2fc ,
where N is the number of the ions participating in the transitions. For N > Be/B (∼108
for B ∼10−8Be) the rate is high enough if the length of the magnetic ﬂux tube participating
in which quantum phase transition occurs longer than 102 meters. Since the intensity of the
magnetic ﬁeld varies extremely slowly along the magnetic ﬂux tube in the proposed model, the
number of the ions participating the transition could indeed be large enough and Tm would
become an unimportant factor.
3. The total lapse of time is T = Tb + Tcl + Tm + Tp, where Tb ∼.01 seconds is the time for the
signal to propagate to the somatosensory area and Tp is the time used by cortex to estimate the
position of the sensory stimulus and activate the MEs taking care of the sensory projection to
the magnetic canvas. Since the coding of the position of skin is topographic, there is no need
to compute the distance and orientation of the stimulus and one has Tp is minimal. This gives
T = Tb + Tcl + Tm + Tp for the classical option 1) and T = Tb + Tm + Tp for the quantum option
2).
3. Constraints from Libet’s experiments
It is interesting to look what Libet’s experiments mean for various options about what precedes
the magnetic quantum phase transition giving rise to the sensory experience. The basic observation
is that the classical signal propagation time along ME, which is .1 seconds for magnetic ﬂux tube at
distance of order Earth circumference, is much shorter than the time .5 seconds between the sensory
stimulus and conscious experience. Thus it does not strong constraints on the model based on option
1).
1. If one assumes that the formation of the sensory representations involves the propagation of a
classical signals along MEs (option 1)), and that the sensory representation of the skin is at
distance of, say, one fourth of Eearth’s radius corresponding to the frequency f = 10 Hz, the
lapse is about T ≃Tb + Tcl + Tm + Tp = .1 + Tm seconds. This allows Tm + Tp ≃.4 seconds. For
Tm ≪Tb Tp ≃.4 seconds is allowed. In classical case there are however bounds on the distance
of the magnetic canvas, ﬁve Earth circumferences is the upper bound.
2. Second option is that the process does not involve classical signalling in the proposed sense so
that the distance of magnetic canvas does not matter at all. ME behaves as a single particle and
is transformed from passive Z0 ME to active em ME in single quantum jump. Suppose the arrival
of the neuronal signal induced by the electrical stimulation of the skin to the somatosensory area
induces this kind of quantum jump, which becomes thus capable of inducing magnetic quantum
phase transition. If this is the case, then the sensory representation of the stimulus could result
after T ∼Tb + Tm + Tp after the arrival of the neural signal to the cortex. If Tm is negligible
one has T ≃Tp ≃.5 seconds. The fact that the stimulation of cortex by .5 seconds is needed to
produce artiﬁcially the sensory stimulus suggests that Tm is indeed negligible.
3. The third option is that there is a ME associated with the entire sensory pathway fused with
the ME associated with the sensory projection to the magnetic canvas and that already the
sensory stimulus at the skin initiates the magnetic quantum phase transition. In this case one
has T = Tm ≃.5 seconds.

Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
6.5.4
The experiment of Radin and Bierman as evidence for quantum jump
between quantum histories concept
The experiments of Radin [J112] and the later experiments by Radin and Bierman [J31, J32] gave
evidence for anomalous unconscious emotional responses preceding their cause. Radin monitored the
sympathetic and parasympathetic behavior of the autonomic nervous system with skin conductance,
heart rate and ﬁngertip blood volume measurements. Subjects were asked to look at a computer
monitor and press a button to start a trial. Button press caused the display of a blank screen for ﬁve
seconds, then a randomly selected calm or emotional picture was shown for three seconds, and this
was followed by ten seconds of a blank screen. In three studies, Radin found signiﬁcant diﬀerences in
autonomic physiology, most notably skin conductance, preceding the exposure of emotional vs. calm
pictures. Radin examined a number of possible normal explanations for the result and concluded that
they did not apply.
Radin and Bierman interpreted the result of the experiment as evidence for a reversal of the arrow
of time. The constancy of the arrow of psychological time is by no means obvious in TGD Universe
and one of the basic challenges of TGD inspired theory of consciousness is to understand how the
(probably statistical) arrow of psychological time emerges. Moment of consciousness as quantum jump
between quantum histories concept provides however an elegant explanation of the eﬀect without any
need to assume the reversal of the arrow of psychological time. What is important that one can
also avoid the poorly deﬁned concept of eﬀects propagating backwards in time, which is needed in
explanations based on quantum state as time=constant snapshot concept.
Consider now the TGD based explanation. In quantum jump deterministic quantum history is
replaced with a new one: this means that, not only the future, but also the past changes. Therefore,
if the mean galvanic skin response of the subject person provides a faithful representation for some
aspects of subject person’s deterministic quantum history, the entire time record about skin response
must change to a new one in any quantum jump. If subject person experiences a highly emotional
stimulus, the moment of consciousness is expected to be more intensive than for calm stimulus in the
sense that the non-determinism associated with the quantum jump is expected to cause observable
eﬀects in a larger space-time volume of the quantum history (represented to a good approximation as
quantum average space-time surface geometrically). Therefore also the change of the quantum past
is expected to be more dramatic as it indeed seems to be according to the results of the experiment.
At ﬁrst it might seem that there are no means to test whether the past has changed at the
moment of consciousness. The experimental arrangement of Bierman and Radin, although certainly
not originally planned to test quantum jumps between histories concept, circumvents in an ingenious
manner this diﬃculty by comparing the skin responses associated with calm and emotional trials.
Standard physics, which is based on assumption that there is no signal propagation backwards in
time, predicts that the average skin responses before the stimulus should be identical for calm and
emotial trials. This is not the case so that the results of the experiments indeed support TGD based
world view.
One can in fact imagine even more dramatic test based on a modiﬁcation of Radin-Bierman
experiment. In quantum-mind discussion group Stan Klein [J77] suggested a modiﬁcation of Radin-
Bierman experiment [J31, J32, J112] providing a test for Stapp’s and Sarfatti’s theories of conscious-
ness [J124, J1] . One could perhaps consider the following further modiﬁcation of Radin-Bierman
experiment so that it would simultaneously discriminate between Stapp’s and Sarfatti’s theories and
TGD.
1. It might be possible for computer to perform a comparison of the presponse with average calm
and emotional presponses before the subject person A sees the picture and, depending on whether
the presponse is nearer to calm or emotional average presponse, to print C or E to a computer
screen such that the printing result is seen by person B before A sees the picture.
2. The theories explaining phenomenon in terms of eﬀects propagating backwards in time (say
Sarfatti’s theory [J1] ) would predict that computer record and the sequence of letters remem-
bered by B are identical and contain both C:s and E:s. According to [J77] Stapp’s theory would
predict that both computer record and B’s memories contain only C:s.
3. TGD predicts that B would see only C:s. The concept of subjective memory implies that B also
remembers of seing only C:s whereas computer records would contain both C:s and E:s. This

6.5. Time delays of consciousness and quantum jumps between histories
329
would provide dramatic support for quantum jump between quantum histories concept and for
the notion of subjective memory.
In TGD framework one can also consider an alternative explanation for the result of Radin-Bierman
experiment. If this explanation is correct, the report of B is consistent with the computer record just
as in Sarfatti’s theory. The argument goes as follows.
1. Given moment of consciousness contains several irreducible subexperiences besides the experi-
ence corresponding to the ”real I”, which presumably corresponds to ”I” able to communicate
using language and possessing long term memories. These ”I”:s are usually collectively identiﬁed
as subconscious mind. The phenomenon of blind sight and related phenomena [?] give support
for the idea that there is second ”I”, most naturally at the same level of self hierarchy. One can
even imagine entire population of selves at some lower level of self hirarchy giving rise to ”Zombi
within us” or shortly Z. In the latter case the response of Z is dictated by statistical determinism
at the level of ensemble. Deterministic response has deﬁnite value in ﬁght for survival.
2. The values of the psychological times associated with these various ”I”:s need not be same in
given quantum jump. Suppose that Z has psychological time slightly larger than the psycholog-
ical time of the ordinary ”I” so that Z sees the state of the world at time t + ∆t whereas ”the
real I” sees it at time t in given quantum jump. The order of magnitude for ∆t is roughly one
second. Assume further that Z is able to assign emotional content to the picture. If the decision
about what picture is shown is purely mechanical involving no quantum jump (and hence only
eﬀectively random) then Z can perceive the picture before the ordinary ”I” perceives it with the
result that galvanic presponse is created. Galvanic presponse is deterministic in case that Z is
an entire population of ”I”:s.
Some remarks about the model are in order.
1. The criticism against this kind of model is that Z is perhaps not able to assign any emotional
content to the pictures. The experiments supporting the existence of Z mildly suggest that Z
sees the things ”as they are” (for instance Z cannot be fooled by visual illusions) which in turn
suggests that emotional response is perhaps not involved.
2. Z could also receive the information about the picture by precognition in principle made possible
by the diﬀuse contribution to the contents of conscious experience coming from entire initial and
ﬁnal quantum histories. If this is the mechanism, one can however wonder why the ”real” I is
not capable to same so that also ”real” ”I” would have conscious experience about the nature
of the picture before seing it.
3. In case of Kornhuber experiments similar explanation would lead to the veto model: the con-
scious decision to raise index ﬁnger is preceded by the conscious decision of Z to raise it and the
”real I” can decide whether to allow various neural processes to continue or not.
4. In principle (probably only in principle) one could test the model by allowing the selection of
the ﬁgure to be shown to A be determined by a quantum jump rather than by deterministic
process. If this quantum jump occurs only very short time before A sees the picture, response
should disappear.
An eﬀect resembling Radin-Bierman eﬀect might occur in much more conrete situation. There is a
legend about the ability of the short distance runners to anticipate the shot of the starting pistol and
start already before the gun shot. Perhaps this really occurs but in the following sense. When short
distance runners hear the shot they perform a quantum jump to a new history. For obvious reasons
they might have developed a skill to jump to a quantum history at which they started before the
gun shot. Whether this eﬀect occurs could be tested by using video camera or some more sophicated
arrangement (gun shot can be accompanied or even replaced by light signal to make the timing
precise). What could happen is that the man with the gun honestly claims that the runner started
after the shot whereas videocamera tells that runner started before the shot. This eﬀect deserves the
nickname ”tribar eﬀect” (tribar is the famous nonexisting triangle like structure formed from three
bars): in its various forms the eﬀect could provide very general hard evidence for TGD based view
about space-time.

Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
Notice that the paradox of ping pong game described in the book of Penrose [J95] can be resolved
in quantum jumps between quantum histories picture. The problem is that the time delays of con-
sciousness are so long that no conscious action seems to be possible in ping pong game. The resolution
is simple. The players can quite well miss the ball time on the old history but perform a jump to a
new history: on this history they do not miss the ball thanks to the rapid deterministic reﬂex action.
6.6
Good and Evil, Life and Death
In principle the proposed conceptual framework allows already now a consideration of the basic ques-
tions relating to concepts like Good and Evil and Life and Death. Of course, too many uncertainties
are involved to allow any deﬁnite conclusions and one could also regard the speculations as outputs
of the babbling period necessarily accompanying the development of the linguistic and conceptual
apparatus making ultimately possible to discuss these questions more seriously.
Even the most hard boiled materialistic sceptic mentions ethics and moral when suﬀering personal
injustice. Is there actual justiﬁcation for moral laws? Are they only social conventions or is there
some hard core involved? Is there some basic ethical principle telling what deeds are good and what
deeds are bad?
Second group of questions relates to the biological death. What happens in the biological death?
Is self preserved in the biological death in some form? Is there something deserving to be called soul?
Are reincarnations possible? Are we perhaps responsible for our deeds even after our biological death?
Could the law of Karma be consistent with physics? Is liberation from the cycle of Karma possible?
In the sequel these questions are discussed from the point of view of TGD inspired theory of
consciousness. It must be emphasized that the discussion represents various points of view rather
than being a ﬁnal summary. Also mutually conﬂicting points of view are considered. The cosmology
of consciousness, the concept of self having mind like space-time sheet and causal diamond as its
correlates, and the vision about the fundamental role of negentropic entanglement provide the building
blocks needed to make guesses about what biological death could mean from subjective point of view.
6.6.1
Life and Death
One can interpret ageing in two senses. The ageing with respect to geometric time and the ageing
with respect to the subjective time. Before discussing ageing in the sense of geometric time one must
specify what one means with geometric time and what one believes its relationship to subjective time
to be.
1. There are two geometric times corresponding to the times assignable to space-time surface and
imbedding space.
(a) The recent argument for the arrow of psychological time allows to understand the ﬂow
of geometric time assignable to space-time surface in manner rather diﬀerent from the
standard one. The causal diamond CD representing self is actually stationary and space-
time surface eﬀectively ﬂows into it from geometric future. A generalized form of NMP
implying that selves are curious and want to know what is in the space-time future outside
the CD implies that selves perform quantum jumps drawing the space-time surface inside
CD. The argument explains also why mental images tend to be located near the future
boundary of CD and thus why sensory input is mostly about a rather narrow time interval.
The arrow of time emerges spontaneously but the CP breaking of quantum TGD might
help to establish global choice of the arrow of time.
(b) One can speak also about the arrow of cosmic time identiﬁed as a gradual growth of the
size of CD quantum jump by quantum jump so that the past boundary of CD recedes.
There are reasons to believe that this cosmic time is discontinuous and its values come as
powers of two.
2. Subjective ageing could correlate closely with the entropy growth due to the randomness of
state function reduction leading to thermalization or the ensemble of mental images.
This
would correspond also to second law.
Also entropic mental images are generated by bound

state entanglement. On the other hand, life as something in the intersection of real and p-
adic worlds with negentropic engtanglement carrying conscious information might change the
situation. Both the growth of negentropy of conscious experience reﬂecting itself as evolution
and the growth of entropy as physicist identiﬁes it and reﬂecting itself as biological againe would
be involved. NMP suggests that negentropy of conscious experience tends to increase and the
biological death is only a transformation to some new form of existence.
The dark matter
hierarchy with levels labeled by the values of Planck constants has become a key element of
TGD inspired theory of consciousness and one can imagine that during ageing these levels of
existence begin gradually dominate consciousness.
What interests us mostly is obviously the subjective ageing and biological death. What dying
person might experience? Is there a continuity of subjective experience or does suﬀering end with
a loss of consciousness. What follows after biological death? How our deeds aﬀect what happens in
biological death and to the experiences after the biological death? Here are some possible answers.
1. Perhaps the only thing that happens in biological death is that the contribution of biological
body to the contents of consciousness disappears so that other contributions usually masked
to a high degree by sensory input and motor activities become into full light of consciousness.
In fact biological body and magnetic body are 4-dimensional and there are good reasons to
expect that it continues to contribute to the consciousness of some self- not necessarily the self
which possessed the body. The question is however about what this particular self that I have
experiences in biological death and after it.
2. The notion of negentropic entanglement suggests allows to consider an answer to what might
happen in biological death from the point of subjective time. Depending on the choices of self
which has the dying person as sub-self, dying person generates bound state entropic entangle-
ment with a loss of consciousness or negentropic entanglement accompanied by an expansion of
consciousness. What option the higher level self chooses depends on the probability of the size
of the contribution of the state with negentropic entanglement.
3. If the dying person has a strong negentropic entanglement with external world, it tends to be
preserved in quantum jumps and only a small entropic contribution is present and there is only
a small probability to lose consciousness. Another manner to see this is that a subself having
very entropic subselves (mental images) is experienced by self as something unpleasant and by
generalized NMP self might want to get rid of this kind of mental image. This would reduce
the chances of experiencing an expansion of consciousness. Perhaps death could be seen as the
price for sins.
4. One could also argue that although consciousness might be lost it might be not be in any manner
diﬀerent from sleep. It could gained back in wake-up but as something diﬀerent from ordinary
wake-up consciousness and determined by the 4-D biological and magnetic bodies and the de-
ceased could remember his former life by still existing 4-D body. The notion of electromagnetic
body, when combined with the view about psychological time, allows to consider a general answer
to these questions. Magnetic body probably survives the biological death, and since it serves as
the sensory canvas, there are all reasons to expect that subjective consciousness continues after
the biological death. The contents of consciousness would be determined by the 4-dimensional
physical and electromagnetic bodies and the dominating contribution creating the illusion about
reality as a time=constant snapshot would be absent. Kind of timeless consciousness would be
in question in accordance with the life review experiences associated with NDEs.
5. One can also ask what might be the physical correlate of self after the biological death. The
4-D space-time sheet representing self very probably does not disappear in biological death and
the 4-D character of the perceptive ﬁeld suggests that this 4-D body continues to exist as a
conscious entity and the sub-CDs of the geometric past representing mental images still exist.
Only at the future boundary of CD the ﬂow of 4-D biological body ceases but the sub-CDs
representing existing mental images ﬂoat to the direction of geometric past in the river of time
and remain consciousness.

Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
Ageing as a price for having self
In standard quantum theory framework not allowing negentropic entanglement self can be regarded
as a statistical ensemble of mental images deﬁned by the unentangled ﬁnal states of the quantum
jumps. Since the size of this ensemble increases quantum jump by quantum jump, the approach of
this ensemble to thermal equilibrium is unavoidable although living matter has probably invented
manners to ﬁght against the second law of thermodynamics. Thus ageing of self means dissipation.
The hierarchy of Planck constants and negentropic entanglement mean deviations from this picture.
1. For higher levels of dark matter hierarchy the dissipation rate is expected to be slower: the naive
expectation is that the rate is inversely proportional to Planck constant.
2. Negentropic entanglement means second exception to the rule and for given CD second law can
be broken in time scales shorter than the time scale characterizing CD [K44] .
Each p-adic length scale deﬁnes its characteristic dissipation rates. In case of a self decomposing
into sub-selves the rate of dissipation is sum over the real dissipation rates associated with the nested
system formed by the self, its sub-selves, their sub-selves, etc....
The dissipation associated with
states of whole-body consciousness can be anomalously small since only negentropic mental images
are absent and if there is only one such mental image (or no mental images at all) there is no generation
of ensemble entropy. A possible test for this is the study of total rate of metabolism during meditation.
Dissipation causes the ageing of self: getting old at least at the level of biological body would be the
price for having self. More concretely, the entropies associated with various distributions of quantum
number and zero mode increments increase during ageing so that mental images are gradually blurred.
Note that also our self which deﬁnes a mental image of a higher level self is blurred. Also biological
death, or at least death experience, seems to be unavoidable fate of self.
Ageing and death from the point of view entanglement generation
The possility of negentropic entanglement allows to see ageing from diﬀerent point of view. Sub-selves
generate either entropic or negentropic entanglement and also the generation of entropic entanglement
should contribute besides the generation of ensemble entropy of mental images to ageing of the bio-
logical body. The generation of negentropic entanglement-perhaps with higher levels of self hierarchy-
would be also an aspect of again. This is suggested if NMP is taken analog of second law holding in
the realm of subjective existence.
1. Ageing as an entropic process could be seen also as a process analogous to the process of
getting drowsy and falling asleep but in much longer time scales. Bodily sub-self would not
remember anything about these periods in the case that the entanglement was entropic. Also
sleep could represent a similar conscious state without bodily mental image and the impossibility
to remember anything about this period of consciousness might be simply due to the fact that
one can remember something about sleep state only in sleep state. The periods during which
negentropic entanglement prevails would be experienced as enlightment like experiences. During
ageing bodily sub-self would spend more and more time near the critical line at which this kind
of phase transition occurs.
2. Ageing could be seen as a process of personal growth generating negentropic entanglement.
The negentropic entanglements generated with larger selves would give rise to larger selves and
the metaphor ’awakening’ would thus be much more than a metaphor. Time-like negentropic
entanglement would mean longer time span of attention. Person would spend more and more
time in extended state of consciousnesss and in death ﬁnally leave the conﬁnes of the biological
body. Note that person need not, and probably doesn’t, remember anything about the periods
of entanglement in which the local topology of self changes.
This would make possible the
evolution of selves continuing after death to higher levels of conscious existence.
This picture is rather optimistic: one must also consider the possibility that the evolution of self
is not always a continuous personal growth! The fact that the individual development of most people
seems to be a process of continual abstraction suggests that biological death is only one step in the
process of abstractions and that our self consciously experiences the ﬁnal transition to higher level of
existence in biological death.

6.6. Good and Evil, Life and Death

Why childhood memories are recalled so intensely?
The ﬁrst manner to see ageing is as a subjective experience: as ageing with respect to subjective time.
Our self contains sub-selves representing our memories, sensory input from the geometric now and
future plans. At the old age it often happens that childhood memories begin to dominate whereas the
recall of more recent memories is gradually lost. Of course, the contribution of future plans becomes
also gradually negligible. This suggests that the contents of consciousness for our self can suﬀer a
gradual transformation such that the childhood begins to dominate: of course, this need not happen
always. That the childhood dominates is not easy to understand if the memories of the past are stored
in the geometric now as assumed in the standard brain science. In TGD framework the very fact that
the childhood consciousness is very intense and un-conceptual, explains the dominance of the episodal
memories of childhood.
Who is the subjective experiencer in this kind of situation? Is it the old person with vivid memories
or a child with some very diﬀuse ideas about future? The view about psychological time would suggest
that the general experience gradually becomes some kind of a 4-dimensional life review such that the
very intense childhood memories dominate but that the person in the psychological now is still the
only one who can transform intentions to actions eﬀectively whereas the 4-D body of the past is more
or less frozen.
Death as disappearance of the mental image representing the biological body?
If one takes seriously the following two assumptions behind the TGD based model of quantum control
and coordinate based on the symbiosis of MEs, magnetic ﬂux tube structures, and matter at the atomic
space-time sheets, one ends up with rather concrete view about what happens after the biological
death. The ultimate sensory representations are realized on the sensory canvas provided by magnetic
ﬂux tube structures of similar size, so that we have magnetic body providing sensory representation
of the biological body and external world [K64] . Our magnetic self very probably survives in the
biological death by the conservation of the magnetic ﬂux.
In this picture the body of after-life body would consists of the magnetic body plus MEs possibly
surviving the death of the biological body. The only diﬀerence as compared to the life before death
would be that the sensory and cognitive mental images representing the biological body (sub-selves)
would disappear and the attention of our self would be directed to something else. Possibly to the
entire time span of 4-D biological body since sensory input and motor actions at the upper boundary
of peresonal CD are absent. Near death experiences indeed support this view [K12] . In this picture
re-incarnation is possible and even plausible and means only that the magnetic ﬂux tube structure
representing our bodily self turns its attention to some other biological body and uses it as a sensory
and motor organ. This new biological body could be plant, animal, human, or perhaps something
else. In this picture the metaphor about biological body as a cloth becomes very concrete.
Since self has an extension with respect to geometric time, it has memories about its earlier history
and one could perhaps identify the continuation of self after the death as that self which has the
memories of self with respect to geometric time before death. In this extended state of consciousness
self could experience the subjective past of the space-time sheet of self and associate it with self’s
recent mindlike space-time sheet.
Near death experiences
Near death experiences provide a testing ground for the general ideas about what might happen in
the physical death. Experiences resembling near death experiences can be produced now in controlled
manner in laboratory circumstances for people well and alive and irrespective of their belief structure
subject persons tell about light tunnels and meeting of deceased relatives [J40] . These experiences
have been found to be therapeutic and are indeed used as therapy to cure severe psychic traumas.
Therefore the materialistic explanation as a hallucination associated with dying brain seems to be
excluded. Near death experiences involve experiences like being in light tunnel, seeing beautiful and
rich landscapes and meeting dead relatives. Also out-of-body experiences are involved. The model of
NDEs are discussed in detail in [K63] and here only some brief comments are represented.
The proposed picture about physical death allows a lot of room to interpret these experiences. For
instance, OBEs allow two explanations.

334
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
1. The ﬁrst explanation is based on the fact that in TGD based model of sensory representations the
magnetic sensory canvas far outside body basically sees the brain in ELF light. This light usually
comes from brain and provides a sensory represention for the external world. TGD predicts also
a mechanism producing background ELF radiation from the entire body at magnetic transition
frequencies and this background would make possible to see the body 3-dimensionally from
outside when the sensory input is absent and does not mask this weak contribution. NDE OBEs
might correspond to this kind of vision reported also by yogis.
2. The experience looking one’s body from outside could mean that some higher level self corre-
sponding to slow EEG waves and higher em selves formed physically by the personnel of hospital
in the hospital room begins to dominate. This self could perhaps see patient’s body with the
combined eyes of the hospital personnel. Indeed, since the sensory input from the biological
body ceases, the illusory identiﬁcation of ’me’ with the biological body ceases and attention can
be directed to this higher level sensory input.
Geometrically the em bodies of our dead relatives would exist in the geometric past and now,
perhaps already in a re-incarnated form. This allows several explanation for the experience of meeting
dead or living relatives. A very concrete model would be based on electromagnetic bridges formed by
magnetic mirrors and connecting us with our relatives and friends. This would make possible for us
to see them in ELF light just like we would see ourselves.
The experience about meeting deceased relatives could be also understood as a special kind of
geometric memory. Generation of the long term memory means classically looking to a magnetic
mirror at classical level and seing the me of the past in the mirror. It is however possible to see
someone else in the mirror since the magnetic ﬂuxtube from the mirror could continue to the body
of the deceased relative of friend instead of my body. In the usual states of consciousness the sensory
input from the psychological now dominates and this contribution is masked. In near death experiences
sensory input from the geometric now is diminished and the transpersonal background contribution
becomes unmasked.
What after biological death?
Biological death could mean the loss of sub-self representing body image and involve extension of the
physical self: this would explain out of body experiences and near death experiences (person near
death looking his body from outside). In fact, an attractive hypothesis, motivated by the quantum
model of brain, is that the topological ﬁeld quanta associated with photons generated by EEG currents
having size of order Earth by Uncertainty Principle, could correspond to selves in our personal self
hierarchy. Also magnetic ﬂux tube structures associated with body and brain could have similar sizes
and serve as a magnetic body [K64] . In biological death these ELF selves could continue to oscillate
as Schumann resonances in the wave cavity between Earth’s surface and ionosphere interacting with
magnetic ﬂux tube structures!
Neutrinos which are proposed to play important role in living matter would correspond to CD
with time scale of order 104 years for the standard value of Planck constant and just this fact suggest
that they could indeed be important. If one believes that even cell sized structures have their own
CDs then the primary p-adic length scale deﬁned by the size scale of a large neuron (10−4 meters)
would correspond to a time scale of the order of the age of the Universe! It seems implausible that
these CDs could disappear totally although zero energy ontology in principle allows it.
Biological body is accompanied by magnetic body and radiation body which provide representation
for the physical (or better to say, material) body. The latter consists of radiation selves (massless
extremals representing topologically rays of light) representing classically the ELF radiation ﬁelds
generated by EEG currents, one is led to ask what happens for these em selves in biological death.
Some of them correspond to resonant frequencies of the em ﬁelds in the 80 km thick wave cavity
between Earth surface and ionosphere known as Schumann frequencies and one can consider the
possibility that that something which might be called soul remains after the biological death and is
represented as Schumann resonances.
The most plausible hypothesis is that both ULF MEs and magnetic ﬂux tube structures remaining
after physical death together with the 4-dimensional body of geometric past deﬁne our self after the
biological death. This leads to the following speculative vision about consciousness after the biological
death.

6.6. Good and Evil, Life and Death
335
1. The transformation of intentions to actions as p-adic-to-real transitions ceases in the biological
death so that the dominating contribution of the psychological now to the experience disap-
pears and conscious experience becomes kind of four-dimensional life review in which also the
contributions from other bodies (say deceased relatives) appear as unmasked.
2. The geometric past, or rather experiences about it, can be gradually reﬁned but no big changes
are possible, so that a totally new life based on diﬀerent decisions does not seem to be possible.
The assumption about totally new life would also lead to paradoxes. On the other hand, the
unstability of the long term memories suggests that the memories about the past life could be
edited. The conscious experience contains also the contribution of the magnetic body continuing
to exist.
3. The surviving magnetic body could attach to some new organism which it begins to use as a
sensory and motor organ. The re-incarnation would have the memories of the past life as an
unconscious background masked strongly by the sensory input and coming clearly conscious only
in some altered states of consciousness. The reports about children remembering they previous
life could be understood in this conceptual framework. This of course makes one wonder whether
young children could remember their past lives. Perhaps someone should ask!
Does soul exist in some sense?
An open question is what happens for the space-time sheet (or CD) assignable to self after biological
death.
1. Could this space-time sheet or CD be called soul? Does this soul continue drift in lightcone and
get attached to some new material system. Or can it disappear in quantum jump? This would
not be a reincarnation in the usual sense of the word. The re-incarnation in the usual sense
if the word would mean that one has memories about the life of someone whose has lived in
past. In TGD Universe this is quite possible since the mechanisms of remote mental interactions
are basically the same as the interaction mechanisms making possible for the magnetic body to
control the biological body receive information from it.
2. ”Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny” principle suggests that the evolution of an individual is
image for the evolution of the entire universe. Biological death would be only a metamorphosis
to some new form of existence, perhaps as topologically quantized classical ﬁelds associated with
the biological body. Magnetic ﬂux tube structures having sizes measured in scale of light lifetime
are especially promising candidates for the components of electromagnetic body surviving in the
death of what is usually identiﬁed as the biological body. Some experimental facts lead to rather
precise ideas about the geometric representation of our selves and also suggest that our existence
continues in electromagnetic form after death [K12] .
Indirect support for the survival of mindlike space-time sheets after death comes from rather
unexpected direction.
1. The phenomenon of phantom DNA suggesting that mindlike space-time sheets associated with
DNA remain in the chamber which contained DNA: in the experiments of Poponin [I32] the
signature of phantom DNA is its interaction with laser light at visible frequencies. Phantom
DNA would be represented by mindlike space-time sheets with size of at least the wavelength
of visible light (10−7 meters). The em selves remaining after our death would have consirably
larger size! One can however consider the possibility that some detectable interaction between
EFL frequency em ﬁelds and ’phantom brain’ (’em soul’) could be possible and make it possible
to prove experimentally the presence of em soul!
2. The claimed successes of homeopathy (for phantom DNA and homeopathy see [K93] and [K32]
). could also have explanation in terms of the mindlike space-time sheets. Homepathic drugs
are fabricated by a repeated dilution of the active drug so that the concentration of the drug
in solution becomes extremely low. The method of fabrication could however imply that ﬁnal
product contains quite many mindlike space-time sheets of the drug molecules. These mindlike
space-time sheets might be able to aﬀect the sickness since the mindlike space-time sheets provide

336
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
a cognitive representation for drug and this mimicry could ’cheat’ the patient to cure. The law
of similarities could have something to do with the mechanism involved.
More concretely, a given quantum transition frequency characterizing the medicine would be
represented as ME with length equal to the wavelength associated with the transition frequency.
The electromagnetic body of the molecule could be mimicked by liquid crystal water blobs
producing similar transition frequencies and thus containing similar MEs in their electromagnetic
bodies. The eﬀect of the medicine would be mediated by the electromagnetic body so that the
’fake’ medicine could indeed cure.
Some support for the extension of self in death is provided by near death experiences. For instance,
looking one’s body from outside could mean that self is entangled with a larger self formed by the
personnel of hospital in the hospital room and sees patient’s body with the eyes of the personnel. This
experience could be understood as experience of, say self representing hospital room: in this experience
the visual experiences of persons in the hospital room would fuse to the experience experienced by
patient entangled with the hospital room. Meeting one’s relatives and elders could mean entanglement
with a larger self formed by the selves of dead and living relatives. This larger self could experience the
abstracted experiences of dead and living relatives. Also the ability of subjects of surgical operations to
occasionally remember about events occurred during unconscious state, supports this view. Magnetic
ﬂux tube structures are the most plausible candidates for the ’body’ remaining in physical death: this
point is discussed in more detail in [K12] .
Is it possible to get into contact with deceased?
There is a lot of subjective evidence consistent with life after death. Near-death experiences are not
the only manner to get convinced for life after death. So called eye-movement desensitization and
reprocessing (EMDR) discovered by Francine Shapiro [J40, J119] induces what could be interpreted
as after-death communications.
1. The experiences of subject persons can be induced by this therapy in highly reliable manner:
according to [J40] 98 per cent of patients willing to participate the therapy had after death
communication experience It does not matter what the religious convictions of the subject
person are and the experiences are actually rather easy to induce. It does not matter if the loss
is traumatic or not or whether it is recent or occurred for decades in past.
2. The experiences resemble near death experiences (light tunnels, beautiful landscapes) and involve
spiritual contact with the deceased. The EMDR technique involves getting the patient to move
his or her eyes in a particular rhytmic fashion while at the same time attending to a particular
aspect of the traumatic memory.
3. How EMRD works is poorly understood as yet: possibly the fact that the shifting of eyes leads
to increased brain processing is of importance.
Notice that rapid eye movements REM are
also involved with dreams.
A possible explanation is that EMDR experiences could involve
communication with the recent selves of the deceased ones located possibly in the geometric
recent or past and represented by magnetic ﬂux tube structure and MEs interacting with them.
6.6.2
Good and Evil
The vision about life as something in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds together with the
notion of negentropic entanglement gives hopes for understanding the quantum correlates of evolution
and even ethics. The basic principle would be that good deeds generate negentropic entanglement
and Negentropy Maximization Principles- perhaps suitably generalized from its original form- would
deﬁne the basic principle of ethics.
Quantum ethics very brieﬂy
There are many manners to interpret evolution in TGD Universe.

6.6. Good and Evil, Life and Death
337
1. p-Adic evolution would mean a gradual increase of the p-adic primes characterizing individual
partonic 2-surfaces and therefore their size. The identiﬁcation of p-adic space-time sheets as
representations for intentions and the identiﬁcation of p-adic-to-real phase transitions as trans-
formations of intentions to real actions gives additional concreteness to this vision.
2. The hierarchy of Planck constants suggests evolution as the gradual increase of the Planck
constant characterizing p-adic space-time sheet (or partonic 2-surface for the minimal option).
This evolution could be seen as a migration to the pages of the book like structure deﬁned by
the generalized imbedding space and has therefore quite concrete geometric meaning. It implies
longer time scales of long term memory and planned action and macroscopic quantum coherence
in longer scales.
The singular coverings of CDs and CP2 are characterized by an Abelian group Zn permut-
ing the sheets of the covering and corresponds naturally to powers of the (quantum) phase
q = exp(i2π/n) allowing to deﬁne the notion of angle in p-adic context but only with a ﬁnite
resolution since only ﬁnite number of angles are represented as phases for a given value of n. The
increase of the integers n could be interpreted as the emergence of higher algebraic extensions
of p-adic numbers in the intersection of the real and p-adic worlds. These observations suggest
that all three views about evolution are closely related.
3. The vision about life as something in the intersection of real and p-adic words allows to see
evolution information theoretically as the increase of number entanglement negentropy implying
entanglement in increasing length scales.
This option is consistent with the ﬁrst one if the
eﬀective p-adic topology characterizes the real partonic 2-surfaces in the intersection of p-adic
and real worlds.
The third kind of evolution would mean also the evolution of spiritual consciousness if the pro-
posed interpretation is correct. In each quantum jump U-process generates a superposition of states in
which any sub-system can have both real and algebraic entanglement with the external world. If state
function redution process involves also the choice of the type of entanglement it could be interpreted
as a choice between good and evil. The hedonistic complete freedom resulting as the entanglement
entropy is reduced to zero on one hand, and the algebraic bound state entanglement implying cor-
relations with the external world and meaning giving up the maximal freedom on the other hand.
The selﬁsh option has the risk of leading to non-algebraic bound state entanglement implying a loss
of consciousness: death as the prize of sin. The second option means expansion of consciousness - a
fusion to the ocean of consciousness as described by spiritual practices.
In this framework one could therefore understand the physics correlates of ethics and moral. The
ethics is simple: evolution of consciousness to higher levels is a good thing. Anything which tends to
reduce consciousness represents violence and is a bad thing. Moral rules are related to the relationship
between indvidual and society and presumably develop via self-organization process and are by no
means unique. Moral rules however tend to optimize evolution. As blind normative rules they can
however become a source of violence identiﬁed as any action which reduces the level of consciousness.
There is an entire hierarchy of selves and every self has the selﬁsh desire to survive and moral
rules develop as a kind of compromise and evolve all the time. The newest progress in this evolution
is brought by the cosmology of consciousness, which forces to extend the concept of society to four-
dimensional society! The decisions of ”me now” aﬀect both my past and future and time like quantum
entanglement makes possible conscious communication in time direction by sharing conscious experi-
ences. One can therefore speak of genuinely four-dimensional society. Besides my next-door neighbors
I had better to take into account also my nearest neighbors in past and future (the nearest ones being
perhaps copies of me!). If I make wrong decisions those copies of me in future and past will suﬀer the
most. Perhaps my personal hell and paradise are here and are created mostly by me.
How the law of Karma could be realized?
The existence of self hierarchy means that our deeds are remembered also after our death at higher
level of self hierarchy although only as an abstracted summary. One can therefore ask whether the
law of Karma or something akin to it might be implied by basic principles of consciousness theory.
First of all, self has two life strategies: be a sinner or saint.

338
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
1. Self can ﬁght for the metabolic energy feed giving rise to the self organization of self. This
strategy works as long as self is a young, brisk and arrogant sinner. Sinners are not desirable
mental images from the point of view of higher level self since they induce a lot of entropic
mental images (pain). This strategy is also in conﬂict with the possible goal of the higher level
self to achieve fusion of its own mental images.
2. Self can attempt to share mental images by quantum entangling its sub-selves with the sub-selves
of other, possibly, higher level selves. This mechanism gives rise to quantum metabolism and
expanded states of consciousness, favors the generation of social structures, and means fusion
of mental images from the point of view of higher level self. The cognitive mental images of the
saintlike self are highly negentropic and favored by p-adic NMP.
On basis of these ﬁndings the policy for higher level selves looks obvious: try to get rid of the
unpleasant mental images represented by sinners. Higher level self could apply this policy for purely
selﬁsh reasons: too bad sinners might aﬀect like a poison to the moral level of the higher level self
and, since the law of Karma is universal, could eventually lead to the decline of the higher level self
to a lower level of the hierarchy: the world would seem to be a tough place also after death!
What ’liberation’ might mean?
The strong analogies with eastern spirituality encourage to ask whether the TGD inspired quantum
counterpart for the concept of liberation might make sense.
1. Quantum-classical correspondence principle suggests that the endless evolution at the level of
the entire universe corresponds to endless evolution at the level of individual so that the notion
of liberation would make sense only as kind of transformation to a higher level of consciousness.
2. In the real context selves having only single mental image or no mental images at all are in state
of ’oneness’ and experience no divisions and separations since the analysis process represented
by state function reductions and self measurements is absent. This kind of state realized at the
level of ﬁeld body is a possible candidate for enlightened state. Certainly it cannot last forever.
3. Liberation experience might also relate to the experience of ”cosmic consciousness”. Most natu-
rally a generation of negentropic entanglement fusing self to a self at higher level of self hierarchy.
The fear about the loss of consciousness is what gives self an ego, since ego is something which
can be lost. This can happen via the generation of entropic bound state entanglement with some
other system. This can happen for any subsystem of Universe but not for the entire Universe
enjoying an eternal state of consciousness. The state of cosmic consciousness thus means being
a self without ego. The counterpart for this would be negentropic entangelement. Leaving aside
the question whether we are able to experience ideal cosmic consciousness, one can consider the
possibility that even human beings could achieve a state of consciousness in which the loss of
consciousness is highly un-probable and that this loss of ego is synonymous with the experience
of liberation.
The term ”cosmic consciousness” looks somewhat pompous notion to anyone identifying himself
with his suﬀering biological body and it would be certainly very diﬃcult to sell this concept to a
neuroscientist. This notion might however have a rather literal meaning in the intersection of real and
p-adic worlds representing life. If p-adic- and real-rational imbedding space points are related via the
identiﬁcation of common rational points, p-adic space-time sheets typically have an inﬁnite size with
respect to the real topology since p-adically inﬁnitesimally small distances necessarily correspond to
inﬁnite real distances. In this cognitive sense cosmic consciousness would have surprisingly concrete
meaning.
6.6.3
About God theory of Bernard Haisch
I have found that the best manner to learn about TGD is to read books about other theories, and
after many years at the border of basic survival I now have opportunity to do this thanks to some
generous people making this possible.

6.6. Good and Evil, Life and Death
339
Just now I have been reading Bernard Haisch’s book ”The God theory” [J72]. Haisch himself
is an astrophysicist who might have become priest. The book discusses the possibility of spirituality
consistent with physics. It also discusses Zero Point Energy (ZPE) hypothesis and the idea that inertia
might emerge from vacuum ﬂuctuations of various ﬁelds.
I agree in many respects with Haisch’s vision about possibility to build bridge between fundamental
physics and spirituality. The new view about spirituality requires that a lot of horrendous stuﬀof
religions (such as eternal purgatory, the sadistic God of Old Testament killing his own son, blind belief
in dogmas, etc...) is thrown away. Where I disagree with Haisch is the notion of ZPE but think that
I understand why he wants ZPE. In TGD all that can be done using ZPE can be replaced with zero
energy ontology (ZEO) to achieve the possibility of re-creation without breaking of conservation laws:
without ability go generate new sub-Universes God would be rather powerless creature. I also disagree
with the idea that inertia follows from zero point ﬁelds although again I understand the underlying
motivations of the proposal as relating to a genuine problem of General Relativity. This problem also
inspired TGD.
Haisch lists three questions usually regarded as highly non-scientiﬁc. Is there really a God? What
am I? What is my destiny? As I started to build theory of consciousness, these questions began to
make more and more sense also to me. One must be however ready to give up some dogmas such as
God as a sage with white hair and long beard, the idea that we are nothing but our neurophysiology
generating a brief ﬂash of light in inﬁnite darkness, and the belief that heat death dictated by second
law is the eventual fate of the universe as whole.
Putting Haisch in box
When thinkers happen to encounter genuine thinking they want to classify it in order to feel safe. For
safety reason some of us also debunk the new idea. The ﬁrst classiﬁcation is philosophical. I use three
boxes for this purpose (safety reasons). The ﬁrst box has label ”monism”. It contains two smaller
boxes. ”Materialist” contains thinkers accepting only third person view as an acceptable - objective
- view about the world. I close to ”Idealist” those thinkers who accept only the ﬁrst person view
as fundamental. Most of my colleagues are happy to live in the box ”Materialist”. The second box
has label ”Dualist” and contains thinkers accepting both ﬁrst and third person views - also this box
decomposes to smaller boxes depending on how closely the ﬁrst and third person views are assumed
to be related: if the correspondence is exactly 1-1 then the view reduces to materialism. To the third
box - ”Miscellaneous” - I put the others and live also myself in this box.
Haisch perfoms the classiﬁcation himself and completely voluntarily chooses the box ”Idealist”.
Hence consciousness is fundamental form of existence for him. In TGD framework both ﬁrst and
third person perspectives are tolerated: consciousness is however in quantum jump between quantum
superpositions of objective realities identiﬁed as zero energy states and does not deﬁne another world
as it does in dualistic theories. As a matter fact, in TGD several ontological levels are accepted:
geometric existence at space-time and imbedding space levels in real and various p-adic versions,
existence as zero energy states identiﬁed as spinor ﬁelds of world of classical worlds (WCW)) and
subjective existence as quantum jumps.
Universe as God
Haisch postulates God as an inﬁnite intelligence. We are God’s eyes and ears through which God
experiences her (no reference to gender here) own creation. Haisch’s God is not the Newtonian clock-
smith who creates deterministic universe and then forgets it completely. This God is free to create
universes with he chooses freely using her inﬁnite intelligence. This God is also somehow outside the
realm of space-time.
The possibility of universes with diﬀerent laws of physics inside each of them brings in mind
inﬂationary cosmology, multiverse, and the landscape of M-theory. Haisch indeed takes inﬂationary
scenario and multiverse idea rather seriously and also talks about superstrings. The landscape of
string theory is catastrophe from the point of view of physics but would ﬁt with the the idea about
God who can freely decide about the laws of physics in the limits of mathematical consistency. But
what mathematical consistency means? Have M-theorists really thought about this?
What about TGD? In TGD framework nothing prevents from calling conscious selves gods since
free will is genuine and the essence of creation. Thus God is replaced with an inﬁnite hierachy of god

340
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
like entities. Nothing prevents from calling the entire Universe as God, which is re-creating itself in
every quantum jump. This God has us as mental images or to be more precise: as mental images of
mental images of ..... of its mental images. The sequence could be rather long;-)!
Concerning the laws of physics the situation in TGD framework. The surprising outcome already
from the geometrization of loop spaces is that geometry of the inﬁnite-dimensional world of classical
worlds (WCW) is expected to be unique if it consists of 4-D surfaces of some higher-dimensional space.
This comes from mere mathematical existence requiring the WCW metric to have inﬁnite-dimensional
group of isometries (generalization of various conformal symmetries of super string models). This
means that also physics is unique just from its existence. As a matter fact, in TGD there is no need
to assume any physical existence behind mathematical existence since consciousness is in quantum
jumps. Space-time dimension and the choice imbedding space are forced by very general mathematical
conditions closely related to the structure of classical number ﬁelds. Four-dimensional Minkowski
space and space-time dimension four are forced by the condition of maximal symmetries needed for
the existences of WCW geometry.
Inﬂation in TGD framework is replaced with quantum criticality making the Universe maximally
sensitive perceiver and motor instrument. Quantum criticality means absence of scales (or actually
discrete hierarchy of them) and the ﬂatness of 3-space (dimensional curvature scalar vanishes) is
the correlate of quantum criticality in cosmology. The inﬂaton ﬁeld producing via its decay matter
is in TGD framework replaced with monopole magnetic ﬂuxes assignable to magnetic ﬂux quanta
which near Big Bang correspond to what I call cosmic strings.
The decay of magnetic energy of
ﬂux quanta to particles produces matter and radiation. The basic diﬀerence to string landscape is
that standard model symmetries apply in all these sub-cosmologies although there are dynamical
parameters distinguishing between them. Hence TGD is highly predictive theory. Even God must
bow to the laws of mathematics. TGD space-time is many-sheeted and one has Russian doll cosmology
natural also in inﬂationary scenarios.
In superstring theory the landscape problem forces to assume anthropic principle: the fact that we
exist becomes the basic guide line when we try to identify the particular universe in which we happen to
live. In TGD framework the evolution implied by Negenropy Maximization Principle (NMP) stating
that the conscious information gained in quantum jump is maximal, implies evolution. Evolution
gradually ﬁne tunes the values of various parameters so that they generate maximal intelligence.
This implies that our existence indeed ﬁxes the values of various parameter very precisely. Of course
there are some parameters such as K¨ahler coupling strength (analogous to critical temperature),
whose possible values are dictated by quantum criticality. Note that NMP challenges second law as
a universal law - at least a generalization is required in ZEO - and it is now clear that the recent
view about universe neglects completely the huge negentropy sources associated with the negentropic
entanglement assignable to magnetic ﬂux tubes carrying dark matter. In human scale these resources
- ”Akashic records”- give rise to memories and plans of future, ideas,...
The purpose of lifes
Haisch adopts the vision about endless sequence of reincarnations as a kind of ”life-school” in which
one transcends life by life to higher levels of consciousness - to upper class in school (and sometime
to same or even to lower one).
This vision could have rather concrete realization in TGD framework. In the average sense the
average size scale for personal causal diamonds (CDs) in their quantum superposition grows in a given
quantum jump, and a biological death now and then does not stop this process. New sub-CDs also
pop up and mean creation of new small sub-Universes which began to evolve. Asymptotically the size
of the personal CD approaches inﬁnity - asymptotic Universe, asymptotic Godness;-)!
Biological death would not mean the end of consciousness, only a transformation to a new level:
perhaps higher, perhaps same, or maybe even lower. This depending on the Karma - the law of action
and reaction at spiritual level as Haisch puts it - that we have gathered by our deeds. By doing bad
deeds reduce our level of consciousness guaranteeing the return to a lower level in hierarchy. This has
quite concrete quantum physical correlate: reduction of the eﬀective Planck constants reducing the
quantal size scales of the magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting as as bridges of attention to the rest of the
world and reducing thus quantum coherence lengths and times characterizing us. It also reduces our
long range goals from those dictated by a mission to short range goals dictated by opportunism.

6.6. Good and Evil, Life and Death
341
What could happen in biological death?
”What is my fate?” is one of the questions of Haisch. A more concrete formulation for this question
is ”What happens to the magnetic body in biological death?”. TGD framework provides the tools for
a glass pearl game around this question.
It would not be too surprising if at least some upper layers of this onion-like structure were
preserved. NMP might guarantee the approximate conservation of the entire magnetic body since
its braiding serves as a correlate for negentropic entanglement deﬁning ”Akashic records”, a kind of
cumulative collective wisdom having as a counterpart Sheldrake’s morphic ﬁelds deﬁning among other
things also species memory.
What it means that in 4-D sense (contents of consciousness are from 4-D imbedding space region:
either boundary of CD in given scale) also our biological body still exists as sub-CD of the larger
CD we continue to exist subjectively? Only the sensory input and motor output conscious- to-us has
ceased in biological death.
Does my biological body continue its life in reversed direction of imbedding space geometric time?
The answer is negative if one relies on the assumption that the arrow of imbedding space time changes
and the folded bath towel argument for the arrow of 4-D time deﬁned by thermodynamical entropy
holds true: my body would continue becoming older than it was at the moment of death. Not very
plausible or desirable scenario!
NMP requires that negentropic entanglement is generated at the moment of biological death and
adds to existing negentropic entanglement deﬁning ”Akashic records” about previous life conserved in
good approximation. What I painfully learned during my lifetime is not waste! Attention is directed
to some target generates negentropic entanglement. It has braiding of magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting
the attending system to the attenfed one.
Reconnection is the mechanism for building ﬂux tube
bridges between the systems.
Tibetan book of dead supports what NMP suggests: I direct my attention somewhere else from
my biological body which has become rather uninteresting. The new target of attention could be some
new brisk young life form not yet caught the attention (almost anywhere in planet or even elsewhere
but inside my personal CD: my magnetic body is big with size scale of - as I hope - about one hundred
light years at least!). My new life would proceed in opposite direction of imbedding space time (recall
that two subsequent quantum jumps create zero energy states with opposite arrows of imbedding
space geometric time). Maybe I remember the teachings of Tibetan book of dead and manage to
direct my attention to a higher level in self hierarchy, larger CD, representing perhaps a collective
level of consciousness.
If one takes fractality seriously, the death of civilizations and cultures could be a process analogous
to biological death. It is diﬃcult to avoid the feeling that this is something which could happen in
not so distant future. If this process corresponds to quantum jump, NMP tells that negentropy is
generated but does not exclude the possibility of a catastrophe in which even entire species suﬀers
extinction and some of our relatives, maybe bonobos, take the lead. The transition could also lead to
a new higher level of consciousness with the prevailing materialistic world view being replaced with a
new one? The individuals who have become aware about the need for a new world view and about
what it might be could serve as seeds of the quantum phase transition.
ZPE or ZEO?
Laws of physics and conservation laws are the basic problem of Haisch and all those who want free
will in the existing ontology of physics. Haisch is also a physicist so that the problem becomes even
more diﬃcult to circumvent! How God can re-create the reality without breaking the well-established
conservation laws? Or are these laws just rules of game that God has chosen to obey in this particular
part of multiverse? But would this lead to mere quantum randomness and does statistical determinism
mean a loss of genuine free will?
If I have guessed correctly, Haisch hopes that ZPE could help God over this problem but to
my opinion ZPE is mathematically hopelessly ill-deﬁned and reﬂects the mathematical problems of
quantum ﬁeld theory rather than reality.
In TGD framework ZPE is eﬀectively replaced with ZEO - zero energy ontology instead of zero
point energy. Zero energy states have vanishing total quantum numbers so that re-creation can be
carried out without breaking conservation laws and standard laws of physics remain true. One can

342
Chapter 6. Time and Consciousness
assign to the positive (say) energy part of zero energy state conserved energy and other quantum
numbers and positive and negative energy parts correspond to initial and ﬁnal state of physical event
in the usual positive energy ontology: no states - just events! Therefore there is room also for God in
TGD Universe. Together with re-creation as quantum jump one obtains maximal free will: any zero
energy state can be created or vacuum in principle. ZEO is also necessary for p-adic–real transitions
representing formation of thoughts and realization of intentions as actions: essentially time reversals
of each other in ZEO as also sensory perception and motor action which generalize to completely
universal concepts.
A possible test for ZEO would be creation of zero energy states apparently breaking conservation
laws in the framework of positive energy ontology. In cosmology the non-conservation of gravitational
energy indeed takes place and can be understood in terms of ZEO: the energy and other quantum
numbers are conserved only in scale which correspond to spotlight of consciousness deﬁned by one
particular causal diamond (CD). Therefore also the consistency of Poincare invariance of TGD with
cosmology requires ZEO.
Are we continually creating tiny Universes as we transform our intentions represented as p-adic
space-time sheets to actions represented as real space-time sheets? Does the replacement of personal
CD with a larger one in quantum jump (perhaps increasing the eﬀective value of Planck constant)
involve also generation of smaller sub-CDs representing mental images. Are our mental images these
tiny Universes that we create?
How to a new sub-Universe this in laboratory? Quantum physicists would perhaps speak about
generating long lived enough quantum ﬂuctuations creating matter from vacuum. I remember having
seen a popular article about a planned experiment in which very intense laser beams would generate
particle pairs from vacuum. Of course, the probability for generating CD containing matter might be
very small but maybe for some selected CDs this might not be the case!
The origin of inertia
Haisch and Rueda claim of having derived inertia appearing as a mass parameter in Newton’s equations
from vacuum energy - see this. The basic idea behind the derivation does not however make much
sense to me. Here is the condensed form of argument.
If one assumes that the quarks and electrons in such an object scatter this radiation, the semi-
classical techniques of stochastic electrodynamics show that there will result a reaction force on that
accelerating object having the form fr = µa, where the µ parameter quantiﬁes the strength of the
scattering process. In order to maintain the state of acceleration, a motive force f must continuously
be applied to balance this reaction force fr. Applying Newtons third law to the region of contact between
the agent and the object, f = fr, we thus immediately arrive at f = µa, which is identical to Newtons
equation of motion.
I confess that I have do not have a slightest idea what this statement might mean. The standard
wisdom is that particle to which no forces are applied does not suﬀer acceleration. Now it would suﬀer
acceleration although net force vanishes: f + fr = 0.
The standard view is that in special relativity Poincare invariance combined with Noether’s the-
orem allows to assign to any system conserved four-momentum and angular momentum. Given a
variational principle coupling particles to ﬁelds one obtains automatically the analog of Newton’s
equations stating that the momentum lost/gained by ﬁelds is gained/lost by particles. Therefore in
special relativity based theories there are no problems.
In general relativity situation however changes.
1. First of all, space-time becomes curved and the symmetries behind Poincare invariance are
lost. One cannot use Noether’s theorem to deduce expressions for conserved quantities: this is
especially catastrophic outcome in quantum theory where the conserved quantities interpreted
as operators play fundamental role. This was indeed the basic motivation of TGD: by replacing
abstract space-time with a 4-D surface in higher-D space possessing the symmetries of empty
Minkowski space, one does not loose the classical conservation laws.
2. There is also another, closely related problem. In Newtonian approach to gravity gravitation
accelerating test particle experiences a genuine force. In general relativity test particle however
suﬀers no acceleration nor force. There seems to be now manner for how these pictures could

6.6. Good and Evil, Life and Death
343
be consistent. Maybe Haisch and Rueda were thinking about this aspect when they made their
attempt to derive inertia from vacuum energy in general relativistic context.
TGD provides a neat solution also to this problem. At 4-D space-time level the orbit of neutral
test particle is indeed a geodesic line and 4-D acceleration vanishes. At 8-D imbedding space
level the orbit of test particle is not a geodesic line anymore and it experiences genuine 8-D
acceleration, whose M 4 part deﬁnes the Newtonian force. The CP2 part of the force is also
present can be neglected since the scale of CP2 is so small (about 104 Planck lengths).


Chapter 7
Quantum Model of Memory
7.1
Introduction
The ideas related to the quantum model of memory have developed gradually from very general ideas
to reasonably concrete models and a connection with biological quantum computer type systems has
emerged. It is good to list the basic ideas and notions brieﬂy to get and idea about this process which
is still continuing.
7.1.1
Geometric and subjective memories
The identiﬁcation of moment of consciousness as quantum jump between histories implies two kinds
of time developments, subjective and geometric, and therefore also two causalities and memories.
By the 4-dimensional general coordinate invariance of quantum TGD, geometric memories contain
information about entire quantum and classical histories. This means that there is no absolute need
to store memories of the geometric past to the geometric now. This has dramatic implications for the
modelling of brain and allows to get rid of the basic problem of the memory models, namely the fact
that the storage of new memories unavoidably tends to destroy the old memories whereas it seem that
childhood memories are actually the most stable ones.
7.1.2
p-Adic physics as physics of intentionality
In purely real contex one ends up with the problem that there is no clear diﬀerence between mem-
ories and intentions: intentions are just memories about the geometric future.
Why the memo-
ries/predictions of geometric future and past are so diﬀerent? The solution of the problem came when
I realized that p-adic physics is physics of cognition, imagination, and intention. p-Adic spacetime re-
gions represent intentions and are about geometric future. In quantum jumps transforming intentions
to actions p-adic regions are transformed to real spacetime regions representing geometric memories
and inducing self-organization patterns giving rise to macroscopic actions. This ampliﬁcation process
is possible by the quantum criticality of TGD universe implying initial value sensitivity. Psycholog-
ical time corresponds to the front of a p-adic-to-real phase transition proceeding to the direction of
geometric future.
7.1.3
Spin glass model of memories
One of the relatively early ideas was that the 4-dimensional quantum spin glass property of TGD
universe must have fundamental role in the realization of memories. Spin glass property predicts fractal
energy landscape in which there are valleys inside valleys inside valleys and memories correspond
to self-organization patterns associated with subself having interpretation as processes leading to
bottoms of various valleys. In TGD framework energy minima are replaced by the maxima of K¨ahler
function deﬁning conﬁguration space geometry as a function of zero modes which are eﬀectively
classical variables in the sense that in each quantum jump a complete localization occurs in these
variables. One can also consider the interpretation of ’energy’ as binding energy of bound states as
function of zero modes. The higher the value of the binding energy, the deeper the valley, and the
345

346
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
higher the probability that system ends up to the bound state and the longer the time spent in the
bound state.
One can also regard life as a process of carving a 4-dimensional statue gradually quantum jump
by quantum jump. The longer the extension of the valley in the temporal direction and the larger the
number of copies of the valley is, the more reliable the memory recall is. The best manner to learn to
remember is to remember. The depth of emotion determines how deep and long in temporal direction
the valleys representing memories are.
7.1.4
Mirror mechanism
MEs provide a mechanism of long term memory which diﬀers from ordinary sensory perception only in
that the ME giving rise to a geometric memory has much longer duration with respect to the geometric
time than the ME giving rise to ordinary sensory perception. To remember something at temporal
distance T in the past is to look at a mirror with length L = cT/2. The mirrors in question must
have astrophysical sizes measured in light years typically and this of course raises obvious objections
against the model. Although this mechanism as such is too strong an idealization, it can serve as a
starting point. For instance, MEs can be also curvilinear and could propagate along closed magnetic
ﬂux loops of the personal magnetic body serving eﬀectively as wave cavities and suﬀer few reﬂections:
this would make possible high precision targeting.
At quantum level remembering means sharing of mental images: this corresponds to the quantum
entanglement between the subselves of the geometric now and of the geometric past. The classical
non-determinism of K¨ahler action is essential in making possible entanglement between systems having
timelike separation. This would be the mechanism of episodal memory, For non-episodal memories
only the the mental image representing the desire to remember would be shared, and the answer
from the geometric past could be realized as classical communications using MEs. Commmunication
would be based on some code, perhaps memetic code, and would generate a conscious experience
in the receiving end, typically verbal memory. Positive energy MEs would propagate with ultra low
eﬀective phase velocity inside brain or along magnetic ﬂux tubes of astrophysical size with sub-luminal
eﬀective velocity (say alpha wave eﬀective velocity). The most often needed non-episodal memories,
say short term memories, could be communicated automatically: in this case the memory recall would
be a geometro-temporally local operation, much like taking a sample from a data stream representing
particular kind of memories with a particular time span. The option is probably not realized for all
non-episodal memories since this would require large energy expenditure.
In this framework synaptic strengths code only cognitive representations and learned associations,
not genuine information about the events of the geometric past.
Brain can be seen as kind of a
collection of standardized features serving as building blocks of sensory and memory representations.
Long term memory is coded in the classical em/gravitational ﬁelds associated with and in coherent
light/gravitons generated by MEs in hologram like manner. Any ﬁnite spacetime region receiving the
classical em ﬁeld of coherent light/gravitons generated by it gets hologram like picture containing info
about entire geometric time interval spanned by ME. If vacuum current is localized to some restricted
spacetime region (it can be!), the hologrammic information is about this region and receiver anywhere
along the ME gets more or less the same information since hologram is in question. Note also that
the lightlikeness of the boundary of ME implies that ME selves have temporal extension deﬁned by
the length of ME.
7.1.5
Third person aspects of memory
Topological quantization implies the notion of ﬁeld body: ﬁeld body accompanies any system be it
molecule or human body. Field body serves as kind of a manual providing higher level abstract rep-
resentations about the quantum aspects of the physical body. The model of sensory representations
realized at personal magnetic body and at Earth’s magnetic body explains both the ﬁrst and the third
person aspects of our sensory experience. Also memories should have third person and transpersonal
aspects realized at the magnetic body of Earth. This prediction is testable: moon traveller conscious-
ness should have diﬀerent third person aspect or this aspect could be even absent. Third person
aspect should be crucial for the generation of social structures and the rapid weakening and reversal
of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld predicted to occur within next 2 millenia might have dramatic eﬀects for the
future of the civilization.

7.1. Introduction
347
The sharing of mental images is crucial for the model of the third person aspect of memories.
What happens is that subself of brain entangles with with the subself of the magnetic sensory canvas
in the geometric past. One could perhaps interpret spontaneous episodal memories as a basic example
of memories communicated by some subself of magnetic Mother Gaia to us.
7.1.6
Symbolic and cognitive representations of memories
Most of our memories are not direct re-experiences.
In fact, it would be diﬃcult to tell whether
memory is really in question if this were the case. Rather, memories are highly conceptual and based
on symbolic representations making possible huge ﬁltering and compression of information. Only in
some special cases direct re-experiencing occurs. The inherent nondeterminism of the p-adic ﬁeld
equations and the classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action make possible to represent sequences of
quantum jumps determining the contents of consciousness of self at spacetime level in terms of p-adic
or real spacetime sheets, that is cognitively and symbolically. Symbolic representations are crucial
for memories whereas cognitive representations are crucial for intentions. Symbolic representations
allow to store information about geometric past to geometric now: history writing is just this kind of
activity. Also brain is doing history writing: to remember is also to form a new memory representation.
It is highly plausible that memory representations are highly abstracted and that the signals from
the geometric past do not recreate directly the experience but serve as names for standardized self-
organization patterns of neuronal activity, ’features’ giving charicature of the experience. This means
that it is not easy to distinguish between TGD based model and standard model of memories.
7.1.7
Biosupercomputers and memories
The most recent but certainly not the last step in the development of ideas was the realization of
a connection between macrotemporal quantum coherence, quantum spin glass property of the TGD
universe, classical and quantum gravitation, and the mirror model of geometric memories.
The interpretation of quantum jump as a creation of a totally entangled holistic state UΨi which
is then analyzed to pieces allows to interpret self measurement cascade as a conscious analysis. The
temporal fractality of consciousness suggest that the lifecycle of any self can be seen as a generation
of multiverse of potentialities followed by analysis (and decay) process. One can see the situation also
diﬀerently. The conscious experience of self is average over moments of consciousness and the eventual
thermalization induced by the quantum jump sequence destroys all conscious information. There must
be some mechanism hindering this and making macrotemporal quantum coherence possible.
To achieve macrotemporal quantum coherence self must be irreducible self for which self measure-
ments and analysis do not occur. The self must also have large number of zero modes transformed
to quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom and this is achieved if self corresponds at spacetime level
to a join along boundaries condensate. In this process the zero modes of the condensing spacetime
sheets become quantum ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom. In this ’state of oneness’ self is able to carry
out quantum computer like information processing which is the diametrical opposite of analysis. The
decay of this bound state to its components corresponds to the analysis period at the level of self.
Macrotemporal quantum coherence is possible by the quantum spin glass property of TGD uni-
verse making the lifetimes of bound states much longer than in the universe obeying standard physics.
Diﬀerent almost degenerate vacuum spacetimes diﬀer only because they have diﬀerent classical grav-
itational energies. The quantum transitions between these almost degenerate states involve emission
of MEs representing gravitons. These topological graviton rays are reﬂected from the curved almost
vacuum spacetime sheet acting as a gravitational mirror and self energy diagrams involving emission
and absorption of the gravitonic ME have interpretation as correlates for the geometric memory recall.
The time scale of human memories is between millisecond and 100 years and this time scale character-
izes the gravitational energies for systems having sizes between cell size and cell membrane thickness
(the number theoretical miracle is that all p-adic length scales in this reange correspond to Gaussian
Mersennes). Microtubules are excellent candidates for realizing long term declarative memories at bit
level so that a connection with Penrose-Hameroﬀviews emerges.

348
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
7.2
Diﬀerent types of memories
TGD predicts two kinds of memories corresponding to two diﬀerent time developments. There is
deterministic (in generalized sense) time development with respect to the geometric time and the non-
deterministic time development by quantum jumps with respect to the subjective time. The memories
with respect to subjective time are about previous conscious experiences and ’real’ whereas geometric
’memories’ are prophecies giving simulations of the geometric past and future assuming that quantum
jumps do not alter the macroscopic properties of the spacetime surface. A good visualization is follow-
ing: each quantum jump represents particular geometric memory whereas the heap of these memories
gives rise to subjective memory. The comparison between expectations and reality is obviously a
central part of mentality and the heap structure implies that this comparison is a basic function of
conscious mind not reducible to anything simpler. It is wellknown that our memories involve a lot of
construction and are more like stories consistent with what we actually have experienced than actual
documents of what happened. Perhaps geometric memories constrainted by subjective memories give
rise to the ’story’.
One can distuinguish between several memory types such as short term memory and long term
memory, episodal memory, procedural memory, implicit memory and associative memory, and it is
interesting to try to ﬁnd whether these memories could be understood in the proposed conceptual
framework. In the discussion below concrete mechanisms for the realization of geometric memory are
not discussed: the reader interested on this aspect of geometric memory can consult [K28] .
7.2.1
Geometric and subjective memories
There are two times in TGD: subjective and geometric. In accordance with this there are also two
kinds of memories: subjective and geometric1.
1. The temporal binding of the experiences associated with quantum jumps occurred after the last
”wake-up” of the self gives rise to subjective memory deﬁned as memory about earlier conscious
experiences and is identiﬁable as an immediate conscious memory, ”phychological now”, presum-
ably of duration of fraction of second in case of sensory experiences. There is inﬁnite hierarchy
of subjective memories and if long term memories are genuine subjective memories (this need
not be the case!), they could correspond to conscious short term memories of higher level selves
somehow communicated to the lower level. An essential element is the possibility of subselves
inside self having much shorter lifetime and organized in a subjecto-temporal sequence: without
them the average over the quantum jumps would destroy the information and it would not be
possible to remember the digits of a phone number. Various rhytmic actions (such as micro
tremor of eyes at 80 Hz frequency and muscle tremor) could generate a sequence of subselves
with constant duration and thus a clock measuring subjective time.
2. Geometric memories are like a classical physics based model for the universe. They are memories
with respect to geometric rather than subjective time and predict what must have happened in
the geometric past and what will happen in the geometric future assuming that world is classical
(no quantum jumps). The temporal extension of the mindlike spacetime sheets and the notion of
the association sequence (3-surfaces consisting of a sequence of spacelike 3-surfaces with timelike
separations providing a simulation of classical history) make possible geometric memories. A
natural hypothesis is that the macroscopic spacetime associated with the ﬁnal state of the
quantum jump represents the geometric memory. Of course, only part of it becomes conscious
and temporal binding implies that self experiences kind of temporal average of the geometric
memories associated with the quantum jumps. An attractive possibility is that our long term
memories, which have narrative character and are unreliable, correspond to geometric memories.
This would mean that there is no need for memory storage mechanisms, four-dimensional brain
would take automatically care of memory storage.
Intentionality manifests itself in many ways: as expectations of the future, planning, goals, desires,
fears, imagination, intuition etc.. It seems natural, and this is the only possibility given the fact that it
1The attribute ’subjective’, as it is used in TGD context, does not have quite the same meaning as it usually
has as something non-objective and unreliable: ’subjective’ derives its meaning from ’subjective time’ as consciously
experienced time as opposed to the geometric time of physics.

7.2. Diﬀerent types of memories
349
is not possible to know anything about future quantum jumps, to identify all aspects of intentionality
with the predictions of the expected geometric future provided by the mindlike spacetime sheet.
Geometry as such contains nothing intentional.
Rather, the intentional aspects of the conscious
experience reﬂect the attitudes towards the expectations provided by the geometric memory.
’Memories’ with respect to geometric time as simulations
Geometric memories are predictions/simulations for what would happen if no further quantum jumps
would occur and what would have happened if no quantum jumps had occurred in the past. Simula-
tions and expectations rather than real memories are in question. Geometric memories become reliable
in the classical limit, when the eﬀect of quantum jumps becomes negligible. In the deterministic world
of classical physics geometric memories would be absolutely reliable. It is indeed possible to predict
rather reliably what will happen in the solar system during the next decade. Geometric memories
are a prequisite of the intentionality often regarded as a basic characteristic of conscious mind: be-
liefs, expectations, plans, etc. involve geometric memory in an essential manner. The computational
approach to mind assumes only geometric memories.
The memory with respect to geometric time is possible even assuming that single quantum jump
determines the contents of conscious experience completely. However, if the contents of conscious ex-
perience are determined completely by the initial and ﬁnal quantum histories of single quantum jump,
it is in principle impossible to have genuine memories about previous conscious experiences. This does
not make it impossible to have a model for the most probable subjective life history through simu-
lation. Quantum statistical determinism could make these simulations possible. One must however
admit that the hypothesis about subjective memory, naturally identiﬁable as a short term immediate
memory deﬁning the duration of psychological moment, makes things extremely simple and natural.
One could also argue that in a universe without subjective memory it would not be possible to dis-
cover the notion of quantum jump so that internal consistency of the theory of consciousness requires
genuine memory about earlier conscious experiences.
Mindlike spacetime sheets and simulations
It is a fact that we can plan future in the time scale of life time. We can also quite reliably extrapolate to
the past without direct memory of what happened. The simplest explanation is that the time extension
associated with those mindlike spacetime sheets, which we have access to, is of the order of lifetime or
perhaps even longer. The simplest model for the simulation would be based on an ensemble of thoughts
scattered around entire material spacetime history deﬁned by, say, my body. Quark sub−CDs could
realize thoughts as Boolean algebra of statements and could be present everywhere in condensed
matter, in particular in water, which is expected to have very rich hierarchy of spacetime sheets.
Self would experience the sum of the abstracted experiences of ensemble members and experience a
simulation about what happens in future and what happened in past assuming that quantum jumps
will not occur in future and did not occur in past.
Of course, selves could also do what computers do, namely mimick other selves by building cognitive
representations about them at their own spacetime sheets. This would make it un-necessary to jump
between the levels of the self hierarchy. These representation could have quite diﬀerent temporal and
spatial scales and the presence of the time scaled versions about time development of other selves
would realize the fractality aspect related to the idea about Universe as a hologram. DNA could
be an example of this kind of simulation of the entire lifespan of individual in molecular length and
time scales. Monte Carlo simulation of elementary physics experiment could be also regarded as a

The diﬀerence between intentions and geometric memories
Intentionality, understood here as time-directedness, manifests itself in many ways: as expectations
of future, planning, goals, desires, fears, imagination, etc.. The basic element of mentality is the
comparison between the expectations of future and what actually occurred.
In TGD framework
this tension between potential and actual can be understood. The temporal extension of the mindlike
spacetime sheet makes possible expectations of what happens in the future assuming that no quantum
jumps occur or at least that quantum jumps do not change the macroscopic spacetime. Single quantum
jump contains information about this kind of expectations. Subjective memory in turn tells what

350
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
happened actually. Therefore it seems natural, and this is the only possibility given the fact that it is
not possible to know anything about future quantum jumps, to identify the predictions of the expected
geometric future provided by the mindlike spacetime sheet as a basic prequisite of intentionality.
Subjective memory makes it possible to compare the expectations with what really occurred since
subjective memory is kind of a heap of predictions of future arranged with respect to the value of
the psychological time. The origin of at least some emotions, which often involve a comparison of
what happened and what was expected to happen, is perhaps here. It is quite well possible that all
comparisons must be realized as comparisons of the subjective and geometric time developments. It
seems that self can also compare its subselves, which correspond to simultaneous mental images.
The possibility of this comparison provide a solution to the paradox raised by the innocent question
’How do I know that the me of today is the same as the me of the yesterday? How do I even know
that I existed yesterday?’. The solution might be simple: mindlike spacetime sheets have extension
which can be much longer than the duration of the subjective memory. Therefore subjective memories
contain information about the geometric me of the yesterday and geometric me of today and since
these me’s resemble each other quite a lot, the conclusion is that also the yesterday’s me was a
conscious self living in this same body. It is however quite possible that temporal entanglement with
higher selves still remembering my past wake-up states is also involved and realized as a formation of
join along boundaries bonds between the mindlike spacetime sheets of my self and of higher level self.
Higher level self could also communicate directly the subjective memories about my existence to me.
The diﬀerence between intentions and memories remained a puzzle for a long time. The answer was
ﬁnally provided by the view about psychological time as a value of the geometric time characterizing
the position of the p-adic-to-real phase transition front propagating to the direction of the geometric
future. The MEs representing intentions are p-adic whereas those representing memories are real.
What is the temporal extension of mindlike spacetime sheets?
With respect to subjective time self and its subselves can be characterized by the typical durations of
the wake-up state. With respect to the geometric time self (or rather, mindlike spacetime sheet) can be
characterized by its own duration and the durations of the mindlike spacetime sheets which it contains.
The time span for the predictions and memories provides an estimate for the duration of mindlike
spacetime sheets. mindlike spacetime sheets can have timelike separations. mindlike spacetime sheets
of geometric past could represent memories so that conscious memories could be regarded as multitime
experiences and the distances between mindlike spacetime sheets could be quite large, of order lifetime.
Durations of mindlike spacetime sheets representing subselves
Sensory experiences seem to correspond to a well deﬁned geometric now having perhaps duration of
order .1 seconds. Thus it seems that mindlike spacetime sheets representing my sensory subselves
have rather short time extension, of order .1 seconds. ’Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny principle’
(ORP) suggests that the extension is of same order as the duration of the immediate subjective
memory, something like .1 seconds. This prediction is certainly consistent with the typical resolution
of the sensory experience, say the ability of the visual system to discriminate subsequent pictures
as separate pictures. Quite generally, the p-adic time scale Tp = Lp/c characterizing the mindlike
spacetime sheets gives the ﬁrst guess for the duration of the mindlike spacetime sheet and duration
of geometric memory provided by it. Note that .1 seconds gives for the p-adic length scale Lp and
estimate which is about circumference of Earth!
The fact is that we have childhood memories, plan future and make reliable predictions. This is not
in contradiction with the duration of the mindlike spacetime sheets associated with sensory subselves.
The mindlike spacetime sheets representing subselves (mental images) can be located in geometric
past or future so that multitime experiences with mindlike sheets of past and future contributing to
the experience are possible.
The duration of .1 seconds is the duration of typical subselves representing our mental images.
The geometric duration of the mindlike spacetime sheet representing our ’main self’ should be much
longger since it contains mindlike spacetime sheets distributed along entire life span.
The subselves which have fallen asleep, wake-up again generating new wave of sensory experience.
For instance, mental images (after images) typically re-appear periodically. We are also mental images
of larger self in the hierarchy and the periodical appearenc e of of our mental images suggests that

7.2. Diﬀerent types of memories
351
also we appear periodically as mental images of this larger self. This would mean reincarnation in the
geometric past so that our life would be lived again and again. Entire trains of mindlike spacetime
sheets could wander through time again and and experience what it is to live in a particular body.
Therefore my body could live again and again: by p-adic evolution each life would tend to be slightly
better than the previous one. The civilizations of past could be still well and alive and even more
civilized! This picture could perhaps explain why persons in their old age sometimes begin to live
their childhood again.
What is the subjective duration of ’our’ self?
Our conscious experience is some kind of an averaged sum over all conscious experiences associated
with the quantum jumps occurred after the last ’wake-up’. If the averaging is completely democratic,
the only possibility is that our sensory subselves have duration not much longer than the the time
resolution of the sensory experience of order .1 seconds. Contrary to the original beliefs, this does not
in principle pose any limitation to the duration of ’our’ self.
There are thus several options concerning the duration of our self.
1. Our self could have duration not much longer than the duration of immediate short term mem-
ories of order .1 seconds. The ability to remember digits of a phone number requires that the
duration is indeed longer. For this option it is not at all obvious how the subjective experience
of personal continuity is possible.
2. The duration could also correspond to the wake-up period. Also now the problem is how we
know that this self existed already yesterday. Note that the gradual thermalization of subselves
means that subjective memories represented by subselves get gradually fuzzy so that the digits
of a phone number are forgotten even if our self has duration of order wake-up time.
3. Our self has a duration of order lifetime, or even longer and only the mental image representing
our physical body has duration of order lifetime. A possible objection is that the mental image
representing our self becomes gradually more and more entropic unless it manages to ﬁght
against second law. This might of course correspond to ageing.
Third option deserves a more detailed consideration.
1. The geometric duration of our ’main’ mindlike spacetime sheet should be of the order of life
span if geometric memory explains long term memories. ’Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny’
principle would suggest that also the subjective duration of our ’main’ self is of order life time.
This option would explain elegantly the fact that we possess subjective identity: this kind of
subjective identity would be a logical deduction in case that our main self has duration shorter
than life time.
2. This option would mean that we are not actually unconscious during sleep but are only unable
to remember anything about what happened during sleep. This would be rather natural since
various sensory and cognitive subselves are not conscious during sleep periods so that also
multitime experiences in which sensory subselves wake-up in night time are rare! It might be
also possible to remember events occurred during sleep state only during sleep.
3. Note that the claims about near death experiences in which entire life is experienced as a kind
of ﬁlm, could be interpreted as very intensive experiences in which mindlike spacetime sheets
along the entire life span ’wake-up’ and give rise to multitime geometric memories. Alternatively,
if bodily self with a duration of order lifetime is a subself of our self (perhaps identiﬁable as
the self associated with our magnetic body), the bodily self representing entire life cycle could
be experienced as a mental image. Also shorter bodily subselves forming a subjectotemporal
sequence, ’ﬁlm’, could be experienced in the absence of the ordinary sensory input.

Habits, skills, associations
The universe of TGD is quantum spin glass [K69] .
This provides extremely general conceptual
framework for understanding how memories/habits/learned skills/asso- ciations are formed.

352
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
1. Mental images (in particular memories) correspond to subselves undergoing self-organizing time
development by quantum jumps leading to self-organization patterns selected by dissipation.
Thus both memes and genes, in particular long term memories, can be regarded as winners
in the ﬁght for survival in which dissipation is the ultimate Darwinian selector. Inhibitory and
excitatory nerve pulses might physically realize ”frustrations” which make possible large number
of almost degenerate energy valleys.
2. The universe of TGD is quantum spin glass characterized by a fractal ”energy” landscape having
valleys inside ... inside valleys (directories inside...inside directories). This structure is ideal for
a hierarchical representation of memories. Memories must correspond to valleys of the spin glass
”energy” landscape into which dissipation takes the system. Memory formation is active process
and memories are charicatures rather than photos and deep valleys of the energy landscape
represent these charicatures. Hippocampus, known to be involved with the formation of the
long term memories, could control the rate of motion in these control variables. The plastic
regions of the brain are the most spin-glassy ones and are the most probable seats of the long
term memories.
3. System has some territory in the energy landscape.
The motion in the zero modes serving
as control variables causes a slow shift of the entire territory. Synaptic strengths corresponds
naturally to the slow control variables characterizing the position of the territory. In the presence
of a metabolic energy feed and sensory input system moves around this territory.
Is genuine subjective memory really necessary?
For a long time the basic hypothesis of TGD inspired theory of consciousness was that the contents
of conscious experience are determined totally by the initial and ﬁnal states of single quantum jump.
A heavy objection against this assumption is that the hypothesis makes it impossible to have genuine
memories about previous conscious experiences. The concept of self however allows the possibility that
the connected series of sequential quantum jumps performed by self after its last ”wake-up” integrates
to single conscious experience. This hypothesis realizes self as an extended object in subjective time
allowing it to have memories about previous conscious experiences rather than only memories with
respect to geometric time.
An attractive additional assumption is that the conscious experiences
of self are kind of subjecto-temporal statistical averages. This would make experiences reliable. In
particular, sensory experiences can give objective reliable knowledge despite the fact that the outcomes
of individual quantum jumps are not predictable. The undesired implication is that for long sequences
of quantum jumps averaging leads to a total loss of information.
The original vision was that geometric memory is made possible by the ﬁnite temporal duration
of the what I called mind-like sheets. The emergence of zero energy ontology led to the conclusion
that all space-time sheets are mind-like since one can assign them to the interior of CDs. Depending
on one’s tastes one could of course refer to p-adic space-time sheets as mind-like (or cognitive). p-
Adic space-time sheets are identiﬁed correlates of intentions, plans, desires,... whereas real space-time
sheets would correspond to sensory experience and sensory memories. Geometric memories are about
geometric past and serve as prophecies telling what would have happened if quantum jumps were
not constantly replacing macroscopic space-time with a new one. Precognitions which can be only
geometric tell what would happen if no further quantum jumps take place. Subjective memory makes
it possible to compare what actually happened with what was expected to happen. It might be that
this comparison is one of the fundamental irreducible mental acts. There is a sharp diﬀerence between
ordinary memories on one hand and precognition and memories about time before birth (the region
in the geometric past of the CD assignable to the 4-dimensional biological body) since the interior of
’personal’ CD is in a preferred position. Interestingly, the CD corresponding to a life time of order
100 years corresponds to a primary p-adic length scale of order 10−7 meters and the age of the universe
to 10−4 meters, the size scale of a large neuron.
A natural identiﬁcation of the subjective memory is as immediate short term conscious memory, or
actually a hierarchy of short term memories corresponding to the hierarchy of selves. This identiﬁca-
tion requires that the subjective durations of our sensory selves are typically of a fraction of second, .1
seconds is suggested by various arguments relating to the ability to experience subsequence stimuli as
separate ones and corresponds to the duration of psychological moment. This time scale corresponds
to the temporal size scale of the CD of electron. The narrative character of the long term memories

7.2. Diﬀerent types of memories
353
suggests their identiﬁcation as geometric memories: long term memories could correspond to multi-
time experiences with contributions coming also from the geometric past (say childhood). It turns
out that this identiﬁcation explains basic facts about long term memories. Declarative memories are
assumed to involve negative energy signals suﬀering a time reﬂection from the brain of the geometric
past. The condition that the energies of the corresponding photons are above thermal threshold can
be satisﬁed if the value of Planck constant is large enough. The emergence of long term memory
and planned action would involves in an essential manner the emergence of large values of Planck
constant [K24] .
7.2.3
Spin glass model of learning and long term memories
The universe of TGD is quantum spin glass [K69] .
This provides extremely general conceptual
framework for understanding how memories/habits/learned skills/associations are formed.
1. Mental images (in particular memories) correspond to subselves undergoing self-organizing time
development by quantum jumps leading to self-organization patterns selected by dissipation.
Thus both memes and genes, in particular long term memories, can be regarded as winners
in the ﬁght for survival in which dissipation is the ultimate Darwinian selector. Inhibitory and
excitatory nerve pulses might physically realize ”frustrations” which make possible large number
of almost degenerate energy valleys.
2. The universe of TGD is quantum spin glass characterized by a fractal ”energy” landscape having
valleys inside ... inside valleys (directories inside...inside directories). This structure is ideal for
a hierarhical representation of memories. Memories must correspond to valleys of the spin glass
”energy” landscape into which dissipation takes the system. Memory formation is active process
and memories are charicatures rather than photos and deep valleys of the energy landscape
represent these charicatures. Hippocampus, known to be involved with the formation of the
long term memories, could control the rate of motion in these control variables. The plastic
regions of the brain are the most spin-glassy ones and are the most probable seats of the long
term memories.
3. System has some territory in the energy landscape.
The motion in the zero modes serving
as control variables causes a slow shift of the entire territory. Synaptic strengths corresponds
naturally to the slow control variables characterizing the position of the territory. In the presence
of a metabolic energy feed and sensory input system moves around this territory.
One can consider two general models of learning and memory recall in this framework, the TGD
version of the neural network model and the genuinely TGD based mechanism on the notion of the
geometric memory. Consider ﬁrst the TGD based version of the neural network model of memory.
1. The possible memories of the system correspond its territory in the ”energy” landscape. Learning
means slow change of the shape of the territory so that memory valleys get gradually deeper
and system ends up to them with larger probability in future.
2. Repeated simulated annealing provides a promising memory recall mechanism.
The feed of
energy from metabolism kicks the system into a motion and dissipation leads it into some valley.
If the valley is quite not correct (correct subdirectory but wrong subsubdirectory), a smaller
kick leads the system to the bottom of some nearby valley which might be correct. By applying
a sequence of increasingly smaller kicks system ﬁnally ﬁnds the correct memory valley. The
conscious attempt to remember corresponds naturally to an external force forcing the system to
move in a correct direction.
There are several objections to this scenario. The ﬁrst mystery is how system knows that the
experience is a memory: there seems to be nothing which would distinguish memory from the expe-
rience occurring for the ﬁrst time. Second problem is that the formation of the new memories tends
to destroy the old ones: the new territory is simply not the old one. Even if one could circumvent
this paradox, it is diﬃcult to understand why the lively episodal memories of childhood are the most
stable ones.

354
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
If long term memories are geometric memories then memory recall mechanism corresponds to
multitime experiences involving generation of mindlike spacetime sheets in both geometric now and
past.
1. Learning by repetition means keeping some subsystem in some deep valley for a long period
of geometric time (system is still in that valley in the geometric past!). This corresponds to
reverberating patterns in neuronal circuits generated automatically or by learning by repetition.
In this picture the modiﬁcation of synaptic strengths is not learning of memories but just what
it seems to be: a modiﬁcation of responses to sensory inputs necessary for survival.
2. The attempt to remember creates mindlike spacetime sheets located in the geometric past. The
probability that a newly created mindlike spacetime sheet is located in the memory valley of
long time duration is high and thus conscious memory recall becomes probable. Also very emo-
tional and ’catchy’ experiences generating long lasting memory valleys are easily remembered.
Childhood memories are often very emotional ones and therefore also the most stable ones.
No ﬁnal vision about what memories are in TGD framework exists yet. What is certain is that
one can distinguish between geometric and subjective memories. The idea that episodal memories
are ordinary sensory experiences with the object of the perceptive ﬁeld in the geometric past is very
attractive and speculative hypothesis which might work in TGD Universe, but more conventional
explanation sounds more realistic in the context provided by the standard neuroscience. What is
lacking still is a clear vision about the precise physical realization of long term memories.
7.2.4
Long term memories
An important question is whether our long term memories correspond to either geometric or subjective
memories or whether they involve both aspects somehow.
Long term memories as geometric memories?
The unreliability and narrativeness of the long term memories would support strongly the interpre-
tation of at least episodal long term memories as geometric memories, that is multitime experiences
involving active mindlike spacetime sheets scattered along entire life span. This option is consistent
with the short duration of subjective memories, which can be even of order .1 seconds characterizing
the duration of immediate sensory memories.
Geometric memories could be realized as multitime experiences involving mindlike spacetime sheets
located around several moments of the geometric time, provide the simplest realization for the long
term memories.
1. The model solves the basic diﬃculties of the neural net models of long term memory. In the
neural net models long term memories are represented by synaptic strengths. The problem is
that the learning of new memories destroys old memories. In particular, the stability of the
childhood memories is diﬃcult to understand. It is also hard to understand how brain knows
that the experience represents memory. One cannot avoid the diﬃculty by saying that novelty
detection tells that experience occurs for the ﬁrst time since the notion of novelty does not make
sense if conscious experience contains only information from single moment of geometric time.
2. TGD model is consistent with neural net models and actually generalizes them. Neural net in
the spirit of TGD corresponds to brain as system moving in spin glass energy landscape. Self-
organization by quantum jumps leads the system to a bottom of an energy valley representing
memory. This model is consistent with the fact that there is no upper bound for autobiographical
memory. One can also understand how learning occurs. The repetition of an experience means
that energy valley becomes a canyon in time direction so that mindlike spacetime sheets in
the geometric past have a large probability to end up to the region representing memory. In
particular, reverberating nerve pulse patterns are ideal for representing long term memories.
3. Highly emotional experiences generate deep valleys and increase the probability of the system of
the geometric past to stay at the bottom of valley. This explains why cildhood experiences are
so stable. In fact, one could identify primitive emotions of pleasure and pain as related to the

7.2. Diﬀerent types of memories
355
motion in the spin glass energy landscape. Pleasure and pain could even directly correlate with
the sign of the increment of the K¨ahler function in the hopping motion in the spin glass energy
landscape. Note that primitive pleasure and pain are are very much like sensory experiences and
one could regard them as sensory experiences of brain about its own motion in spin glass energy
landscape. This leads to the generalization of the notions of sensory experience and motor action
to include the motion in spin glass energy landscape and to a considerably new insight about
the meaning of the brain architecture.
There are also perinatal experiences, memories about previous lives and transpersonal experiences
having natural explanation in terms of geometric memory realized as multitime experiences associ-
ated with mindlike spacetime sheets located at diﬀerent values of the geometric time. Transpersonal
experiences suggests that self is dynamical: if prenatal experiences, memories about previous lives
and transpersonal experiences are really what they seem to be, the geometric time extension of self
should dramatically increase during these experiences.
If ’our’ self has duration of order lifetime, also subjective memories can contribute to our long term
memories. As already found, this option does not exclude the possibility that our long term memories
correspond to subjective memories.
Geometric memories as sensory experiences with the object of the perceptive ﬁeld in
the geometric past?
The general theory of qualia to be developed in [K28] leads to the conclusion that geometric memories
could be regarded as special kind of sensory experiences for which some objects of the perceptive ﬁeld
located in the geometric past. One also ends up with a concrete models for the mechanism making long
term memories possible by ’waking up’ subselves of the geometric past in selective manner by EEG
frequencies. The unavoidable conclusion is that massless extremals (MEs) with durations of order
lifetime, and hence with sizes which are measured in light years, are necessarily involved. Needless to
say, one must give up the idea that we are nothing but our brains.
The fact that the lightlike boundaries of MEs serve as quantum holograms and have gigantic
information storage capacities by the almost degeneracy of the states ﬁts nicely with view. Lightlike-
ness means that 3-dimensional time=constant slice of Minkowski space is replaced with a slice which
can have arbitrary long temporal duration so that memories become indeed possible. The fact that
at least vision represents directly information about outer surfaces of 3-dimensional objects rather
than objects themselves but contains information about time development over an interval of order .1
seconds ﬁts nicely with this view.
The realization of long term memories in terms of magnetic quantum phase transitions induced by
ME frequencies requires incredibly high frequency resolution. The resolution is of order ∆f/f ∼∆T/T
giving ∆f/f ∼10−9 for time resolution of about ∆T = 1 seconds. An unrealistically high frequency
resolution is required if temporal coding by EEG frequencies is assumed.
There is also another
problem: if the signal to the geometric past and back is between parts of brain, one cannot avoid
zigzag type MEs eﬀectively representing a repeated reﬂection between two mirrors. In the p-adic
context these zigzag MEs are allowed by conservation laws (this might relate with the fact that long
term memories are mostly cognitive) but not in the real context.
These observations suggests that one should allow MEs and magnetic ﬂux tube structures with
length scales of order light lifetime and try to invent a more elegant mechanism of long term memory.
One might start from the mirror idea and consider the possibility that memory recall involves a
question sent to the geometric past as a classical signal reﬂected back to brain in a mirror formed
by a magnetic ﬂux tube: perhaps passive MEs are involved at this stage. Thus MEs with lengths
of order of light lifetime (L = cT) would be required. The answer could involves a transformation
of passive MEs to active em MEs and the generation of quantum entanglement unless it is present
already: the recalled experience is shared by the experiencer now and experiencer in the geometric
past.
The mechanism involves several purely TGD based features: the lightlike character of the
boundaries of MEs making possible lightlike selves; spacetime sheets with a negative time orientation
allowing classical signals to propagate backwards in time; the magnetic ﬂux tube structures associated
with brain having sizes of order light years making possible MEs to form mirrors. Precognition is the
temporal mirror image of this mechanism.
If long term memories are in some sense sensory experiences with the object of the perceptive

356
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
ﬁeld in the geometric past, the notion of the magnetic canvas should work also in these astrophysical
length and time scales. Consider ﬁrst the constraints on this mechanism.
1. The sensory experiences at diﬀerent levels of the magnetic hierarchy cannot be identical. This
means that standard sensory representation using magnetic canvas must be applied to realize
the episodal memory. This leaves only two possibilities. Either the experience is coded to a
lightlike vacuum current and this information, when sent into future, regenerates the sensory
experience there. Alternatively, future self could entangle with the self of the geometric past
and share its experience.
2. Since MEs correspond to 3-surfaces moving with light-velocity, the only possible realization of
the communications between geometric past and geometric now is in terms of ’laser mirrors’
connected by MEs representing geometrically the light reﬂected in the mirror. The length of
ME is given by L = cT: 2T is the moment of the geometric past which gives rise to the memory.
Interestingly, Peter Gariaev has suggested that laser mirrors are involved also with DNA [I16]
. This means that a ME extending from the brain of the geometric now to the geometric past
and the ME from the brain of the geometric past fuse with the same magnetic ﬂux tube to
form a representation for light reﬂected in a cosmic mirror. The MEs and magnetic ﬂux tube
structures associated with the relevant parts of brain must form pre-existing, tightly correlated
structures since the probability for the formation of this kind of mirrors accidentally is extremely
small and there is no guarantee that they connect parts of the same brain. Second mirror would
be obviously deﬁned by the join along boundaries contact of ME with the magnetic ﬂux tube.
Hippocampus is a natural candidate for the brain structure, at which the ﬁrst mirror is located.
The fact that MEs represent channelled energy means that distance is not a problem as far as
energetics is considered.
3. Active memory recall must involve a question sent to the geometric past followed by an answer
communicated to future in some manner. There must be some diﬀerence between precognition
and memory recall so that the question and answer cannot be realized in the same manner.
This serves as an important guideline.
Various arguments lead to the view that the desire
to remember is communicated to the geometric past by sharing and fusion of mental images
made possible by entanglement. In the case of episodal memories also the memory recall would
result in this manner. For non-episodal memories the memory would be communicated from the
geometric past using classical communications.
Sharing of mental images if time-like quantum entanglement is generated between the selves of
the geometric past and geometric now. This is possible in TGD framework, thanks to the non-
determinism of K¨ahler action making also MEs quantum holograms in quantum gravitational
sense.
The fact that MEs represent lightlike selves, would be essential for this realization.
The beauty of this realization is that the information need not be transferred classically. This
realization is actually a special case of the realization in terms of zigzag ME in much shorter
length scale: in this case a huge number of reﬂections in the mirror pair would be required and it
is diﬃcult to understand how one could control the temporal position of the self of the geometric
past in this kind of situation.
This picture deserves some further comments.
1. If the higher levels of the magnetic self hierarchy are intelligent as one might expect (and
even more intelligent than us), one can also consider the possibility that the step in which the
interaction of ME representing a question sent to the geometric past with the magnetic ﬂux tube
at the higher level of the hierarchy is far from a mechanical interaction. Rather, the magnetic
ﬂux tube structure could act as an intelligent conscious system rather than a mechanical relay
station.
2. The process could also have interpretation as an exchange of two virtual MEs between brain and
magnetic ﬂux tube structure: kind of a very low frequency counterpart of self energy Feynmann
diagram realized as a generalized Bohr orbit.
The Feynmann diagrams for the emission of
parallel photons are infrared divergent. This encourages the expectation that the probability
for the presence of MEs parallel to the magnetic ﬂux tubes is very high and increases with the

7.2. Diﬀerent types of memories
357
increasing length of ME. The spontaneity of the episodal memories is in accordance with this
view. An interesting question is how these MEs relate to 1/f noise.
3. The assumption that the lengths scales of MEs and magnetic structures are identical implies
that the frequency of EEG ME equal to the magnetic transition frequency fm ﬁxes the length of
the two MEs involved and thus the temporal location of the long term memory in the geometric
past:
T = 2
fm
.
This represents a frequency coding for the temporal location but in a manner diﬀerent from the
one proposed originally. In particular, this coding does not require ME frequencies to be in EEG
range and deﬁned with a relative accuracy of order E −9. In standard physics the idea about
brain generating MEs with a frequency scale of the order of the inverse of lifetime does not make
sense: in TGD context situation is diﬀerent since this process occurs in subjective time.
If this picture has captured something essential from the nature of the long term memories, the
conclusion is that we are not at the top of the magnetic sensory hierarchy. Human body and brain
generates extremely weak magnetic ﬁelds and the corresponding magnetic ﬂux tube structures could
serve as a sensory canvas making possible long term memories. Near death experiences [K12] could
be understood in this framework if the weak magnetic ﬁelds associated with the higher levels of the
fractal hierarchy of magnetic structures utilize brain and body as kind of sensory and motor organs.
Note that there is ﬂux tubes inside ﬂux tubes structure so that ordinary sensory experiences can be
associated also with these ﬂux tubes.
Long term memories as memories of higher level self?
The natural identiﬁcation of the immediate short term memory as subjective memory predicts that the
life time of a human sensory self cannot be much longer than .1 seconds, the duration of psychological
moment of time. Our long term memories correspond to much longer time interval and cannot thus
correspond to our subjective memories. Entire hierarchy of subjective memories is however predicted
and a possible model for genuine long term memories is as resulting from temporary entanglement
with selves belonging to the higher level of the hierarchy. Also this identiﬁcation is consistent with
the fact that there seems to be no upper bound on autobiographical memory. Summation hypothesis
implies that our genuine long term memories would be sums over a large number of wake-up periods
of self in the subjective past of the self. Therefore one could perhaps understand how ageing self gains
gradually wisdom from experience: also the identiﬁcation of the long term memories as geometric
memories explains this.
Higher level selves could communicate their subjective and geometric memories as well as the
emotions generated by their comparison to us. The ﬁrst idea to come into mind is that communications
occur during totally entangled state, sleep or trance. For this option it is not at all clear how the
experiences of the higher level selves during entangled state could be ours! In fact, we should lose
our selves during entanglement with self characterized by larger p-adic prime. For instance, during
sleep without dreams entanglement with some higher level self should occur and we do not remember
anything about this. Trance is a second example of this: subject person does not remember anything
about the trance state. Thus it seems that this mechanism cannot give rise to conscious long term
memories. This does not however exclude the possibility that cognitive representations are formed
during the communication and lower level self experiences them later as memories. One function
of sleep might be the generation of the entanglement with higher selves making in turn possible the
communication of genuine memories of subjective past to our mind. This communication could realize
these memories as thoughts about the experiences of past realized as nerve pulse patterns regenerating
these thoughts.
The so called semitrance mechanism [K71] avoids the objections against communications occurring
in totally entangled state. During semitrance parts of brain are entangled with some higher level self.
These selves can communicate their memories to that part of brain which is awake (communication
means generation of mental images). Ancient men received these communications as sensory hallu-
cinations (’God’s voice’), very much like schizophrenics, whereas modern man experiences them as

358
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
thoughts and emotions which are often ’hallicinatory’ in the sense that they are not automatic reac-
tions to the sensory input. The TGD based vision for the development of language and civilization
modiﬁes Jaynes’s vision about bicameral man as a schizophrenic of modern society and relies on the
notion of semitrance. Semitrance mechanism is extremely general and could be present in all length
scales. For instance, semitrance could provide the inhabitants of cell societies (organisms) and protein
societies (cells) with a personal self narrative (genetic determination of cell as self narrative!).
Semitrance mechanism survives the most obvious counter arguments.
1. The general objection is that the memories of the higher level selves are rather abstract. The
assumption communication mechanism is restricted to thoughts and emotions is however con-
sistent with the abstract nature of the non-episodal long term memories. The most natural
identiﬁcation of episodal memories is indeed as personal geometric memories or possibly as
artiﬁcially generated sensory hallucinations stimulated by higher level self during semitrance.
2. Since semitrance mechanism is only a communication method, geometric and subjective memo-
ries remain the fundamental memory mechanisms. Therefore the nice features of the geometric
memory are not lost. For instance, one can understand learning and the role of emotions and
repetition in learning.
More complicated scenarios
One can consider also more complicated scenarios for realizing long term memories.
1. Ensemble of mindlike spacetime sheets could generate continuously cognitive representations
remaining in ideal case unchanged and memories as ability to re-experience would be carried
by mindlike spacetime sheet when it wanders to the direction of future. This would require
that mindlike spacetime sheets replicate just as material spacetime sheets (DNA, cells, members
of species) do. If mindlike spacetime sheets responsible for memories of this kind have ﬁnite
lifetime, say of order one second, short term memories could be realized in this manner without
cognitive population explosion. In fact, cell division might realize long term memories in cell
populations. Perhaps also DNA replication might be regarded as this kind of memory.
2. The realization of long term memory and communication relying on replication is rather prim-
itive and the fact is that neurons do not replicate. A natural explanation is that neurons have
discovered procedural memory, which means that long term memories could be realized dy-
namically: standardized nerve pulse patterns generate standardized temporal patterns of quark
magnetization. This implies ability to regenerate the thought stimulated by the primary experi-
ence and associative learning would associate memories to experiences as thoughts. This picture
would correspond to that of ordinary associative nets and is subject to the standard counter
arguments such as the loss of old memories caused by the learning of the new ones.
3. Sustainment of the mental images is indeed one of the basic mechanisms behind human intelli-
gence and can be also seen as a manner to enhance the probability that a geometric memory in
the past is recalled. Sustained mental images are analogous to the icons of the computer screen,
which in fact supports the idea that the evolution of computers mimics in many respects the
evolution of the brain. At program level icons correspond to program loops. At neural level
to periodic neural process generating again and again the same mental image (not necessarily
directly conscious to us).
4. Written language and symbols are the next step to the internal sustainment and make possible to
achieve a given sensory and cognitive experience in a controlled manner. Program ﬁles are obvi-
ously analogous to the written language (the electronic control systems preceding the computer
era were eﬀectively computer programs but were not written as computer code, externalized).
DNA could be seen also as ROM type memory of living systems.
7.2.5
Implicit memories
A possible deﬁnition of implicit memories is as memories which exist but are not created in conscious
experience of the subject person. Also implicit learning could be deﬁned in this manner. A good

7.3. Model for long term memories
359
example of implicit memory is provided by a situation in which unaesthetized patient can quite
accurately remember what has been said during the operation [J87] . An example of implicit learning
is the learning of grammatical rules without any explicit (conscious) representation for them. The
status of the implicit memories and learning is not established. A possible reason for this is that it
is not easy to understand them in computational paradigm of consciousness. Connectionism explains
implicit learning and memories as unconscious formation of associations and mathematically modelled
by the dynamics of the neural networks.
In TGD framework implicit learning and memories could correspond to learning and memories at
the lower levels of the self hierarchy not usually conscious to us. In case that the mindlike spacetime
sheet corresponding to our subself forms join along boundaries bond with a lower level self so that lower
level self fuses with the subself in question, its memories can become our conscious memories. ORP
suggests that this process involves also the formation of quantum entanglement and this indeed must
occur. Biofeedback could be understand as a special case of this process. In the TGD based model
for the quantum correlates of the sensory qualia this process is key role. The memories communicated
by semitrance mechanism can indeed be and probably often are implicit.
One can consider also formation of join along boundaries bonds between our subselves and subselves
of other persons. This is quite possible if our subselves indeed correspond to topological ﬁeld quanta
representing ELF photons associated with the EEG frequencies having size of even size of Earth.
Formation of join along boundaries contacts between topological ﬁeld quanta of this size would make
for us to experience the memories of other persons. This kind of mechanism could explain the memories
of anesthetized patient about what happened during the operation as memories of subselves of the
persons participating the operation. An open question is whether the mechanism could also explain
also out-of body experiences, in which patient looks himself from outside, sometimes involved with
this kind of situations.
Implicit learning could also correspond to the development of various cognitive skills realized
as self-organized self cascades so that no explicit representation of the skill is needed: when initial
value self wakes up, the cascade proceeds with highly predictable manner due to quantum statistical
determinism. Even the ontogeny could be regarded as this kind of skill implicitely coded in DNA!
7.2.6
Procedural memories
Procedural memories seem to be mostly stabilized sequences of thoughts and mental images and
the proposed model for cascade like generations of selves provides therefore a model for procedural
memory. Procedural memories could be simple cognitive acts occurring again and again as a reaction
to some speciﬁc stimulus. mindlike spacetime sheet would carry them while drifting into the future.
For an ensemble of selves with each self initiating cognitive acts is in question, reliability of memories
would result.
Quantum spin glass model of brain explanains for formation of the procedural as resulting from
quantum self-organization. Dissipation caused by quantum jumps would automatically select skills,
habits and eigen behaviours as surviving self-organizing patterns. These patterns would correspond
to deep valleys in the fractal energy landscape of the spin glass landscape, which is eﬀectively four-
dimensional. Repetition would automatically lead to the learning of procedural memories since it
would extend the valleys in time direction so that mindlike spacetime sheets would have larger prob-
ability to enter to the valley and give rise to memory. For instance, reverbrating nerve pulse patters
in the memory circuits of brain would realize this repetition.
7.3
Model for long term memories
In the following an attempt is made to understand how long term memories could be realized at
neuronal level. I hope that my fragmentary knowledge about the details of brain science would not
mask from the reader the beauty and simplicity of the general mechanism. The model is constructed
ﬁrst at general level and then basic facts about long term memory are discussed in the framework of
the model.

360
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
7.3.1
General ideas
In TGD framework one can make a precise distinction between genuine memories and apparent mem-
ories such as procedural and implicit memories, associations, feature recognition, and standardized
neuronal ’features’ serving as building blocks of memories. The basic question is whether the repre-
sentations of the long term memories are realized in the brain geometrically now or in the brain of
the geometric past. In TGD the latter option is allowed by timelike quantum entanglement made
possible by the non-determinism of K¨ahler action. The very fact that the memory storage of past
memories to the geometric now is not needed, means that there is no need to carve long term memories
to associative structures so that geometric now would contain representations about moments of the
geometric past. Only the representation of the event at time when it occurred is needed. For example,
this implies that long term potentiation (LTP) is just learning and adaptation to a new situation and
can only be related to the modiﬁcation of memory representations and possibly the construction of
new standardized features.
Mirror mechanism
Mirror mechanism is the simplest quantum mechanism of episodal memories and involves only a
sharing of mental images by entanglement. The brain hemisphere sends a negative energy ME to
the geometric past reﬂected at a large distance and returning back to the hemisphere and induces a
sharing of mental images. The desire to remember something and the memory of the past fuse to a
single mental image shared by the brains of the geometric past and now. The desire to remember
would be communicated to the geometric past also in case of non-episodal memories whereas memory
itself would be communicated classically by positive energy MEs.
In a more realistic situation multiple reﬂections for a curvilinear negative energy ME along a closed
magnetic ﬂux loop would occur and guarantee precisely targed communications to the geometric past.
The sizes of these loops would be measured in light years. MEs and magnetic ﬂux loops associated
with the personal magnetic body are the most realistic candidates since in this case the interaction
with matter is minimized.
The notion of memory ﬁeld supports this idea. Retrograde amnesia leads to a selective loss of
memories in some time interval, and the notion of memory ﬁeld provides a possible explanation. This
means that brain structures with a given memory ﬁeld entangle with those events of the geometric
past which are located in some time interval ∆T at temporal distance T in the past. A closed magnetic
ﬂux tube with a given length L(T) would obviously be a correlate for a memory ﬁeld with a given
time span T.
The sharing of mental images mechanism requires only that gravitational MEs take care of only
quantum entanglement and because it allows arbitrary kinds of episodal long term memories. The
electric stimulation of neurons can induce complex episodal memories. This can be understood if
the episodal memory recall involves only the entanglement by the negative energy ME and the ﬁeld
pattern associated with ME does not matter at all. The unique experimental signature of the quan-
tum entanglement mechanism is that no direct correlates for the memories themselves are necessary
in the brain geometrically now. One can wonder what distinguishes the resulting experience from
precognition by the self of the geometric past: could it be that to precognize now is to remember in
the geometric future?
The direct sharing of sensory experience is non-economical in the sense that the amount of the
irrelevant information is very high. The conceptualization involved with the symbolic representation
allows to represent only the absolutely essential aspects. In case of classical communications symbolic
representations is of course the only practical possibility. Since the brain of the geometric past serves
as a passive entangler and does not have the possibility to process the communicated information, the
sharing of the mental images is not ﬂexible enough and does not allow an active precisely targeted
memory recall. It is also very diﬃcult to tell whether sensory experience represents memory or a
genuine experience.
Classical communications and non-episodal memories
For non-episodal memories classical communication mechanism suggests itself as a more appropriate
mechanism. Classical signalling requires the coding of the data to the shape of the ﬁeld pattern propa-

7.3. Model for long term memories
361
gating along positive energy ME, which could be curvilinear and analogous to a radiation propagating
in a wave cavity deﬁned by a magnetic loop of the magnetic body.
MEs are indeed optimal for the coding of the classical signal since the vacuum current for given
moment of geometric time is non-deterministic. Classical communications would allow and also require
the minimization of the data communicated.
These memories would not be sensory unless back-
projection to the sensory organs is involved at the receiving end.
The formation of the symbolic
representation is subject to errors: for instance, temporal order of events can change. It is known
that declarative memories can often involve changes of the temporal order. It must be emphasized
that declarative need not be synonymous with non-episodal.
Declarative memories could be also
episodal and correspond to sharing of a symbolic mental images of the geometric past. The ”features”
of Freeman [E1] having during of about .1 seconds are good candidates for the representation of
the classical signals and the time scale suggests that electron’s causal diamond is involved as also
quark CDs with time scale of 1 ms. If EEG MEs are involved, the modulation of hippocampal theta
frequency is a candidate for the representations of classical signal.
There are are two basic options for how the classical communication could occur.
1. Positive energy ME would not leave brain at all and would therefore have ultra slow eﬀective
phase velocity along the brain structure in question, say axon, so that it would not leave brain
during its travel to the geometric future.
2. Positive energy ME would be curvilinear and parallel with magnetic ﬂux loop of the personal
magnetic body serving eﬀectively as a wave guide.
In this case the reduction of the phase
velocity to EEG wave phase velocity would be enough. For instance, for the phase velocity of
alpha waves propagating along loops with the size of the order of the Earth’s circumference,
the time span of the memory would be of the order of one year. In this picture one of the
functions of the part of EEG representing evoked responses could be classical communications
making possible non-episodal memories. Only part of these memories would be conscious to
us. The length of the magnetic loops is expected to directly correlate with the period of EEG
frequency involved with the classical communication via the relationship L = vT would provide
a second correlate for the notion of the memory ﬁeld. There are indeed reasons to expect that
the structures communicating signals to the geometric future are specialized to communicate
signals to a certain distance.
The most plausible neurophysiological excitations associated with the received signal are Ca++
waves known to have extremely wide velocity spectrum. For the option a) the required velocity would
be of order neuronal sizes per year, and this is perhaps unrealistically low velocity. It is also diﬃcult
to see how the neuronal noise would not spoil the signal. For the option b) the positive energy ME
entering brain at the moment of memory receival would induce Ca++ waves in turn inducing neural
activity.
For classical signalling the transformation of the classical signal to a conscious experience is needed.
MEs could directly generate membrane oscillations and nerve pulse patterns via the general mechanism
of nerve pulse and EEG discussed in [K62] . EEG MEs could in turn induce cyclotron transitions at
the magnetic ﬂux tubes of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld in turn aﬀecting nerve pulse generation. Also
a transformation of the signal to Ca++ waves could be possible. The conscious experience does not
involve sensory component unless there is back-projection to the level of sensory organs involved.
Interesting questions relate to the interpretation of the ultraslow eﬀective phase velocity of MEs
acting as bridges connecting two space-time sheets.
1. The classical ﬁelds from a larger spacetime sheet A can be transferred to a smaller spacetime
sheet B topologically condensed on A by inducing the motion of the wormhole contacts, which
in turn generate classical ﬁelds at the smaller space-time sheet. The ﬁelds can also penetrate
along join along boundaries bonds connecting the boundaries of two space-time sheets.
2. Quite generally, the ”topological” half of Maxwell’s ﬁeld equations implies that tangential compo-
nent of E and normal component of B are continuous at the junctions connecting the boundaries
of two space-time sheets. One could assume that quantum eﬀects can be modelled phenomeno-
logically by introducing the phenomenological D and H ﬁelds introduced also in the Maxwell’s
theory. In the Maxwell’s theory the discontinuity of the normal component of the D ﬁeld equals

362
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
to the density of the free surface charges and the discontinuity of the tangential component of
the H ﬁeld equals to the free surface current. These conditions can be assumed also now, at
least as the ﬁrst approximation.
3. One could model the propagation of MEs topologically condensed at a spacetime sheet labelled
by a p-adic prime p ≃2k, k prime or power of prime, by introducing the di-electric constant
ϵ(k) and the relative permeability µ(k) satisfying the condition ϵ(k)µ(k) = 1/v2 > 1/c2 = 1,
where v is the eﬀective phase velocity of ME depending in general on its fundamental frequency.
The ﬁelds D and H would be deﬁned as D = ϵ(k)E, H = B/µ(k): this condition generalizes
to that for the Fourier components of the ﬁelds. The reduction of the eﬀective velocity for the
propagation of the topologically condensed MEs to say alpha wave phase velocity does not seem
plausible.
4. The propagation of MEs which serve as bridges between boundaries of two spacetime sheets
(say cell membrane spacetime sheet and cell exterior spacetime sheet) must be modelled diﬀer-
ently. One could introduce a generalized di-electric constant ϵ(k1, k2) and permeability µ(k1, k2)
characterizing the pair of spacetime sheets such that the eﬀective phase velocity v(k1, k2) of
MEs acting as bridges satisﬁes ϵ(k1, k2)µ(k1, k2) = 1/v2(k1, k2), and also now depend on the
fundamental frequency of ME. A very large value of ϵ(k1, k2) implying the needed very small
value of the eﬀective phase velocity would mean that the orthogonal component of the electric
ﬁeld does not appreciably penetrate inside ME from either spacetime sheet. Since MEs are
the fundamental topological ﬁeld quanta, this looks a natural assumption. The extremely low
eﬀective phase velocity should be due to the replacement of the wormhole contact coupling with
the join along boundaries coupling causing the ”stucking” of MEs. Note that the join along
boundaries coupling is topological sum coupling for boundaries whereas wormhole contacts rep-
resent topological sum coupling for interior. Furthermore, join along boundaries contacts can
have a macroscopic size whereas wormhole contacts are CP2-sized: this could explain the huge
reduction of the eﬀective phase velocity for the boundary MEs.
Negative energy MEs as ideal entanglers with the geometric past
MEs with negative energies are especially favoured for quantum communications. The reasons are
many-fold. The interaction with the matter is very weak in long length scales but strong in cellular
length scales, negative energy implies that ME is identiﬁable as a virtual particle and analogous
to a part of a Feynmann diagram so that no dissipation is involved and quantum communication
is possible. The reversal of the arrow of geometric time means also that there is not macroscopic
dissipative dynamics which would spoil the quantum coherence.
The requirement that the entanglement process is highly selective suggests a resonance mecha-
nism. This requires that receiving and sending structures are similar and generate ULF MEs with
fundamental frequencies measured typically in cycles per year. If negative energy energy ME is in
question, as suggested by the idea that a classical communication to the geometric past is involved,
it cannot be emitted unless there exists a receiver absorbing the negative energy and in this manner
providing energy for the sender by buy now-let others pay mechanism. For negative energy MEs
resonance mechanism plus a simple classical signal serving as a a password could also guarantee that
correct part of the brain receives the signal.
Negative energy MEs represent time reversed level of the p-adic length scale hierarchy so that the
dissipative eﬀects associated with the space-time sheets with the normal arrow of time should not
interfere with the quantum communication. This at least, when the energy of the negative energy
ME has a magnitude larger than the thermal energy associated with the space-time sheets with which
it interacts: there is simply no system which could make a transition to a lower energy state by the
absorption of a negative energy ME. Furthermore, since the systems with reversed arrow of geometric
time are expected to have extremely low density, the dissipative eﬀects in the reversed direction of
time are expected to be small.
Since the generation of negative energy MEs does not require energy feed, the memory recall
to the geometric past occurs more or less spontaneously, and the scanning of the geometric past
becomes possible. The intentionality of the memory recall would be realized as generation of a p-adic
ME transforming to a negative energy ME, when the real system jumps to a higher energy state.
This process makes possible precisely targeted intention also in the case of memory recall since the

7.3. Model for long term memories
363
transitions in question cannot occur spontaneously.
In the case of precognition precognizer must
intentionally receive negative energy MEs from the geometric future so that energy feed is needed.
This perhaps explains why precognition is so rare. Note that p-adic variant of pre-cognition having
interpretation as intentionality occurs easily since p-adic energy is conserved only in a piecewise
manner.
The most often needed non-episodal memories, say short term memories, could be communicated
automatically: in this case the memory recall would be a geometro-temporally local operation, much
like taking a sample from a data stream representing particular kind of memories with a particular
time span. The option is probably not realized for all non-episodal memories since this would require
large energy expenditure.
7.3.2
Could gravitation have something to do with long term memories?
Could classical gravitation stabilize irreducible bound state entanglement?
Bound state entanglement gives rise to a ’state of oneness’ in which quantum computing system is
totally bound-state entangled and does not decay into subselves in self measurement process and can
thus behave eﬀectively as a non-dissipating system and quantum compute. The estimates for the
duration of this kind of bound states tend to be much shorter than required [J130] . The question is
whether classical gravitational interaction could somehow stabilize these bound states.
The extremely low value of the gravitational binding energy is an objection against the view that
gravitational interaction could help to stabilize the bound states. The huge degeneracy of the bound
states could however change the situation.
1. Suppose that spin glass degeneracy gives rise to a huge number of almost degenerate bound
states for which only the classical gravitational energy is diﬀerent and that for non-bound states
this degeneracy is much smaller. The dominant part of the binding energy is of course something
else than gravitational. If this is the case, the number of the bound states is so large as compared
to the number of unbound states that the branching ratio for the decay to unbound state is very
small and bound state entanglement can last for much longer time as usually. Although the
lifetime of an individual bound state need not increase, the time spent in bound states and
deﬁning decoherence time become much longer than predicted by standard physics.
2. If the join along boundaries bonds are suﬃciently near to vacuum extremals, they indeed allow
immense spin glass degeneracy with slightly diﬀerent gravitational interaction energies and the
desired situation can be achieved.
3. This argument can be reﬁned by using unitarity. If the net rate for the transitions to bound
states is enhanced by the degeneracy of the bound states, probability conservation implies that
the probability for the occurrence of decohering decays is reduced correspondingly.
A rough order of magnitude estimate for the gravitational binding energy for a cubic blob of water
(that is living matter) having size given by p-adic length scale L(k) is
Egr(cubic, k) ∼GM 2
L(k) = Gρ2L5(k) ∼
Gm2
p
L(137)
L5(k)
L5(137) ≃2−12725/2(k−137)
1
L(137) .
Gravitational binding energy is larger than the p-adic energy 2π/L(k) for L(k = 179) ≃.169 mm. In
the range L(163) = 640 nm and L(167) = 2.56 µm gravitational binding frequency varies between 1
Hz and 1 kHz, that is over EEG range up to the maximal frequency of nerve pulses. If the binding
energy gives estimate for the lifetime of the gravitationally bound states, this might ﬁt nicely with
EEG energies in typical cell length scales!
For k = 157 and k = 151 (the range from cell 10 nm-80 nm, microtubules are at the lower end of
this range) the gravitational binding frequency corresponds to a time scale of 8.5 hours and 32 years
respectively so that the time scales relevant for life are spanned by the Gaussian Mersennes. What
sounds paradoxal is that short length scales would correspond to long time scales but this indeed
follows from the inverse square law for the gravitational force.
One can perform a similar estimate for linear structures. Parametrizing the microtubular transver-
sal area to be d = x2L2(151), L(151) = 10 nm, one has

364
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
Egr(lin, k) = x5 × Egr(cubic, 151) L(k)
L(151) .
This gives for L(k) ∼1 meter, the frequency of .1×x5 Hz. The time scale varies between 10/x5 seconds
and 32/x5 years and certainly covers the time scale for human long term memories. Of course, this
rough estimate involves numerical factor which can increase the upper bound.
Note that the increments of the gravitational energy between transitions between almost degenerate
bound states are some fraction of the gravitational binding energy. Also the gravitational interaction
energy associated with the classical em ﬁelds could contribute signiﬁcantly to the density of the
gravitational energy in TGD framework and tend to increase the overall energy scale. The reason
is that the gravitational constant associated with classical ﬁelds is roughly 108 times larger than the
ordinary gravitational constant [K5] . Thus, if the energy of classical ﬁelds is more than 10−8mp ∼10
eV per proton the classical ﬁeld energy of, say, join along boundaries bonds becomes signiﬁcant factor.
Since hydrogen ground state binding energy is about 13 eV, this kind of energy density per atomic
volume looks quite reasonable in case of water.
TGD universe is quantum critical system in the sense that spacetime sheets representing magnetic
and electric ﬁelds with arbitrary large sizes are present and correspond to two phases in equilibrium
(compare with ice and water at melting point).
Electric-magnetic duality is second fundamental
symmetry of quantum TGD. Magnetic ﬂux tubes carrying constant magnetic ﬁeld (in lowest order
approximation) have as their duals spacetime regions carrying electric ﬁelds (constant in lowest order
approximation). In biosystems various electrets and magnetic ﬂux tube structures are the concrete
realization of these two phases. Classical gravitational eﬀects generate vacuum 4-currents near the
boundaries of these structures serving as sources of magnetic resp. electric ﬁelds. The boundaries of
these structures are singularities of the classical gravitational ﬁelds and these gravitational ﬁelds are
good candidates for generating gravitional MEs responsible for long term memories.
Long term memory and gravitational MEs
Interestingly, MEs (topological light rays) with fundamental frequencies with time scale measured
using year as a unit are needed in the mirror model of long term memories (to remember event at a
distance of T in past is to look in mirror at a distance L = cT/2). The gravitational transitions between
huge number of almost degenerate spin glass states could be coded to the fundamental frequencies of
MEs. In particular, structures with sizes slightly above cell membrane thickness, such as microtubules,
could generate these MEs as the topological correlates of graviton emission with frequency equal to
the increment of the gravitational binding energy in quantum jump involved. Thus there would be a
direct correlation with long term memories and microtubules: microtubule conformations could code
for long term memories.
The mirror mechanism of long term memory has beautiful interpretation in terms of topological
correlates for virtual graviton exchange with vacuum.
1. The light reﬂected in mirror corresponds to topological light rays assignable to gravitons and
is reﬂected from the curved vacuum. Topological counterpart of virtual graviton is emitted by
(say) tubulin, absorbed by vacuum and and emitted again by vacuum, and ﬁnally absorbed by
tubulin. Curved vacuum acts as a mirror for gravitons and you see yourself in this mirror.
2. Why gravitons are the only possibility in time scale of years is simply that they interact so weakly
that they can propagate light years before absorbed by curved vacuum. Time scales come out
correctly and microtubules are known to be crucial for long term memories (Altzheimer’s disease
involves changes at microtubular level).
3. There are also genuine vacuum extremals interpretable as topological graviton rays.
These
graviton rays could reduce to vacuum MEs except in the turning point. This would mean ’self-
reﬂection’ without scattering from background and interpretable as an absorption and emission of
a virtual graviton. In case of nonvacuum extremals, classical momentum conservation however
requires that the topological graviton exchanges momentum with the background spacetime
surface and thus is mirrorred from it.

7.3. Model for long term memories
365
4. One could interpret the low energy topological graviton rays responsible for long term memory
as a particular kind of 1/f noise accompanying all critical systems, in particular TGD Universe,
which can be regarded as a quantum critical quantum spin glass. Gravitonic 1/f noise would
be emitted in the transitions between almost degenerate spin glass states and would be kind of
analog for gravitational brehmstrahlung.
If this view is correct, the time scales of long term memory at DNA level would correspond to very
long time scales characterizing consciousness at the level of species. As a matter fact, the gravitational
binding energy associated with L(139) ∼.1 nm (atomic physics) corresponds to the age of the universe:
perhaps this explains why Schr¨oedinger equation applies to the description of atom. 1/R dependence
of the gravitational interaction energy would explain why very short length scales code biological
information about very long time scales rather than vice versa.
7.3.3
Is the right brain hemisphere the quantum entangler?
There are some reasons to suspect that the quantum communications with the geometric past oc-
cur more dominantly in the right brain hemisphere whereas classical communications would occur
in the left hemisphere. This would explain among other things the holistic aspects of right brain
consciousness. Left brain hemisphere is specialized more to symbolic processing of information and
would indeed be more suitable to classical communication of this information.
Clearly, right brain would be passive receiver whereas left brain would be active expresser. DNA
strands would be an example of this dichotomy at molecular level. This dichotomy would be realized
also at the level of gene expression using MEs as the model of biophotons involving in essential manner
negative and positive energy MEs suggets. Of course, this statement must be take only in the spirit
of fractality and wuold hold true only in certain range of p-adic time scales.
The following arguments lend some support for the proposed division of labour between right and
left brain hemispheres.
Synesthesia as a key to the mechanism of episodal memory
What forces brain region to send negative energy MEs and thus to remember?
”Hunger!” is the
possible answer! During synesthesia the metabolism in the left cortex is reduced by by 18 per cent
due to the abnormally high metabolism in memory circuit (for the model of synesthesia see [K70]
). Perhaps the generation of the negative energy MEs is forced by the starvation of the neurons of
the left cortex induced by the over-activity of the neurons of the memory coordination circuit. The
starving cortical neurons of the left hemisphere would send massive amounts of negative energy MEs to
the direction of the geometric past inducing entanglement bridges by the mirror mechanism with the
brain of the geometric past in turn inducing episodal long term memories by the sharing of the mental
images. Thus the miraculous ability of synesthetes to remember episodally could be understood to
result as a by-product of a neuronal emergency reaction.
There are good reasons to expect that same mechanism might be at work also in the normal
situation but involve a less dramatic artiﬁcial starvation of the neurons of the right brain hemisphere.
Clearly, the role of hippocampus is dramatically diﬀerent from what is usually believed and also
forces to question the naive belief that neuronal activity is a measure of the contribution of brain area
to the conscious experience. While building long term memory representations as classical signals
hippocampus and memory circuit would steal energy from certain areas of cortex, and the resulting
metabolic starvation would force them to send negative energy MEs to gain energy in this manner.
This in turn would lead to the generation of long term episodal or non-episodal memories as a side
product. Quite generally it is known that limbic brain and cortex tend to work in complementary
modes: when the cortex is in a high state of arousal, limbic brain is in a state of low arousal and vice
versa. Perhaps the passive brain region is involved with memory recall and the active one with the
construction of sensory or memory representations.
Left-handedness and episodal memory
It is known that persons with many left-handed family members have better ability for episodal
memory recall and that this probably relates closely to the communication between left and right
hemispheres. We begin to have verbal memories only after the age of four: at this time also the

366
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
connection between right and left hemispheres has matured. The proposed mechanism of non-episodal
memories requires that the right brain hemisphere shares the mental image representing the desire to
remember and the left brain hemisphere communicates the memory classically. Als the communication
between right and left hemisphere is necessary for this process to occur. Children before the age of four
could live in a kind of a dream time experiencing mostly sensory episodal memories and presumably
not being able distinguish memories from genuine experiences. This would also explain why we do
not have declarative memories dating to the time before the age of four.
How could one understand the tendency of persons with many left-handed family members to
have better episodal memory recall? The ability to have sensory memories can appear also when a
damage occurs to the regions of the left hemisphere. It could be that classical communications between
the hemispheres are worser than usually when episodal memory recall is favoured, and are replaced
by quantum communications. The mental images in the left brain hemisphere would entangle with
those in the right hemisphere entangling in turn with the geometric future and give rise to episodal
memories. Thus the quantum communications between hemispheres might be better than usually.
This kind of persons would be more ”holistic” than ordinary persons.
NDEs and long term memories
That negative energy MEs could be responsible for episodal long term memories is supported by near
death experiences. Persons having near death experiences are clinically dead: in particular, EEG is
absent. If these persons indeed have conscious experiences and if they are able to remember them as
it seems, and since EEG signals are out of question, only MEs generated during NDE remains as a
viable alternative in TGD framework. Brain or possibly body should be involved with the receival of
geometric memories if spin glass degeneracy is essential for the time-like entanglement by MEs.
Life review is one important aspect of the NDE experiences: entire 4-dimensonal body is experi-
enced simultaneously. The starvation of neurons forcing them to generate negative energy MEs could
explain the episodal memory feats of synesthetes and the eidetic memory, and would naturally be at
work also during NDE experience. This is not the only possibility. This experience might also be
partially due to the absence of the dominating p-adic-to-real phase transition changing intentions to
actions. This life review memory could be interpreted as geometric memories not masked by the nor-
mal contributions to the contents of consciousness. An interesting possibility is that this contribution
is generated by theta and delta bands of EEG during lifetime and is present also normally but, being
strongly masked, is not recognized.
Dejavu experiences and memory feats
Dejavu experiences provide a challenge for any realistic model of memory. In Dejavu the sensory
experience is accompanied by the feeling ’I have experienced this already earlier’.
A natural working hypothesis is that purely sensory memories, sensory re-experiences, do not
contain information about the value of the geometric time associated with the sensation. This means
that sensory memories cannot be distinguished from real experiences. On the other hand, cognitive
and symbolic memories diﬀer so radically from the sensory experiences that there is no diﬃculty of
distinguishing them from genuine experiences. Therefore one knows that the experience represented
by this kind of memory occurred in geometric past or represents an expectation of future. Symbolic
(real) and cognitive (p-adic) representations are very probably continually transformed to each other.
If this view is correct, then the simultaneous occurrence of the sensory and cognitive memories implies
dejavu experience. The event giving rise to the sensory and cognitive memories might have occurred
only few seconds earlier.
This view has some nontrivial implications concerning the character of conscious experience of
children. Cognitive abilities are thought to appear only after the age of four or ﬁve years. If also
symbolic memories are absent, small children might live in a kind of dream time, as also members of
primitive cultures, such as aboriginals, are believed to live in. Also dream consciousness could involve
in an essential manner sensory memories as suggested by temporal acontinuity of dream consciousness.
One could also see dreams as transformations of cognitive representations to sensory ones and such
reverse to what occurs in wake-up consciousness so that surreal dream logic could basically result from
p-adic non-determinism. The back projection to the sensory organs would be an essential element of
the mechanism.

7.3. Model for long term memories

The absence of a temporally organized consciousness would explain why we do not possess mem-
ories from the age before four. Perhaps also the bicameral consciousness, which according to Jaynes
preceided modern consciousness, was kind of dream time consciousness in which memories were direct
sensory experiences, like voices experienced as voices of gods and visual hallucinations. According to
Jaynes, also schizophrenics are modern bicamerals.
Some time ago I saw a TV document about some autistic persons, who have very serious cognitive
defects like inability count the number of objects if it exceeds two, are capable of miraculous memory
feats. One of these fascinating individuals was an artist who could draw in full detail a picture about
an area of London containing thousands of buildings after havin seen the area once from a helicopter.
Another autistic artist, virtuoso pianist, could reproduce every piece he had heard with highly personal
style. Perhaps also great musical wunderkinds like Mozart have had similar direct sensory memory
for music. Also a brain damage spoiling cognitive abilities can lead to the blossoming of exceptional
artistic gifts. If the neuronal metabolic starvation forces the generation of negative energy MEs in
turn giving rise to long term episodal memories then one could indeed understand how brain damage
could have this kind of positive consequences.
The explanation suggesting itself is that the loss of cognitive memory is compensated by sensory
memory in this kind of situations. A plausible reason for why average human being has dominantly
cognitive memories is simple. Sensory memory contains huge amounts of un-necessary data: symbolic
and cognitive memories have much higher survival value since only the relevant data are stored.
Sensory genii have very hard time in the modern society unless they work as artists!
In light of foregoing, the poor cognitive abilities of animals suggest that also animals remember
predominantly sensorily and live in dream time (note however that rats have hippocampal theta). For
instance, dogs might have sensory memory dominated by odours. The challenge is to invent tests for
this hypothesis. One could also try to device a non-destructive method leading to a temporary loss
of cognitive consciousness and making possible to spend a day as a dog.
7.3.4
Going to the neuronal level
The following attempt to develop the model of long term memory at the neuronal level is made
involves many uncertainties and must be taken as an exercise in order to get accustomed with the
ideas involved.
Which parts of the brain are the quantum entanglers?
It is known that the electrical stimulation of amygdala, hippocampus, and temporal lobes can generate
lively sensory memories. The simplest explanation is that quantum entanglement with the sensory
representations of the geometric past is in question. The role of the electric stimulation would be only
the generation of time like entanglement, not providing any information characterizing the memory.
This would mean that large portions of brain can participate to the generation of episodal memories.
The fact that the part of body must be able to generate negative energy MEs with a proper
ULF time scale, poses constraints on the system involved. Cellular sub-systems and microtubules are
good candidates in this respect since the transition frequencies for the transitions involving change
of classical gravitational are in the required range. Since resonance mechanism is probably involved,
there are good reasons to believe that similar system is is involved with both the receival and sending
of the message. Microtubular structures are good candidates adn accompany both neurons and glial
cells.
Energetics poses also constraints. The receivers of negative energy MEs should have an easy access
to the metabolic energy resources compensating the negative energy. In fact, the receiver must be in
an excited state, which decays when negative energy ME is received (dropping ions to a larger space-
time sheet could be also involved). Glial cells serve as metabolic resources of the brain and interact
with neurons via Ca++ waves and are the ﬁrst guess for the system entangling with negative energy
MEs. Other parts of brain and body, even sensory organs, can get metabolic energy by entangling
with astrocytes via negative energy MEs so that the desired sharing of mental images would indeed
result.
The notion of memory ﬁeld [J68] was derived from the study of short term memory and applies
to the neurons of the frontal lobes at least. The span T of the memory ﬁeld is essentially the time
span of the long term memory. T correlates strongly with the fudamental frequency associated with

368
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
the negative energy ME if quantum entanglement is involved, and the length of magnetic loop and
curvilinear negative energy ME satisﬁes L ∼cT = c/f, where f is a frequency related to a transition
in which gravitational energy of the system is question changes.
When f is expressed in terms of the size of the water blob generating gravitational negative energy
ME in spin glass transition this gives T ∝L−5, where L is the size of the water blob serving as a
gravitational quantum antenna. MEs with T varying in the range 8.5 hours- 32 years in the length
scale range 80 nm-10 nm are generated. One day (24 hours) would correspond to a length scale 33
nanometers: 3.3 times the thickness of the cell membrane. In case of neurons only the intracellular
structures having much larger sizes and much higher gravitational binding energies might serve as
entanglers (larger spacetime sheets would be in question) and give rise to short term memory. The
time scale of 1 minute corresponds to about .3 micrometers, millisecond corresponds to L(167) ≃2.3
micrometers, whereas L(163) corresponds to a time scale of 1 second. This would suggests that sub-
neuronal water blocks larger than the size of cell nucleus could generate short term memories which
need not be conscious-to-us. Perhaps the ﬂux loops of the magnetic body of the cell nucleus are
involved.
For linear structures like microtubules one has T ∝1/L.
Even in this case a rather strong
dependence on the time span of the long term memory on the system generating negative energy
MEs results. The fact that microtubules are ideal for representing conscious information symbolically,
suggests that neuronal/astrocytic microtubules serve as the entanglers at sending/receiving end of
the quantum communication line responsible for long term memories. This picture also suggests that
the magnetic ﬂux loop of a given astrophycal length scale is associated with a microtubule of a given
length.
Where the classical signals are generated and received?
There are several bits of information helping to guess how long term memories might be realized.
1. The damage of the hippocampus leads only to a loss of the ability to generate new declarative
memories but does not lead to a loss of long term memories from the period when hippocampus
was intact. Thus it seems that hippocampus plays essential role in the communication of our
non-episodal declarative memories to the geometric past and that at least a dominant part of
the receivers are somewhere else than in hippocampus. Since the stimulation of both amygdala,
hippocampus and temporal lobes induces long term episodal memories, it would seem that all
these structures can serve as quantum entanglers.
2. New neurons and glial cells are regenerated in hippocampus and the regeneration is especially
intense during ischemia which can destroy a lot of neurons [J64] . This would suggest that both
glial cells and neurons are essential for the realization of long term memories.
These pieces of data give some guide lines in the attempt to build a more detailed model of long
term memories.
1. The generation of classical signals requires metabolic energy and this suggests that the generation
occurs as near as possible to energy resources.
Glials cells are known to be the providers
of the metabolic energy. Synchronously ﬁring neuron groups are accompanied by astrocytes
forming gap junction connected structures.
For a long time it was believed that astrocytes
play only the role of passive energy storages but it has become clear that there is signalling
between astrocytes and neuronal groups based on Ca++ waves. Astrocytes couple also strongly
to sounds: for instance, it is known that very mild blow in head inducing sound waves can
lead to a loss of consciousness. Perhaps the astrocyte structures associated with hippocampal
neurons generate positive energy MEs responsible for the classical communications making our
non-episodal memories possible.
2. The receival of the classical signal does not require metabolic energy. If astrocytes are involved
with the sending of the classical signal, then neurons would be naturally the receivers of the
signal and the energy received with the signal would partially explain why synchronous ﬁring
of neuronal groups seems to require less metabolic energy than expected. Of course, quantum
entanglement by negative energy MEs wither energy sources could also explain this.

7.3. Model for long term memories
369
Is memetic code used to code declarative long term memories?
Memetic code is a good candidate for the coding of declarative long term memories. The duration of
single memetic codeword would be about .1 seconds and the duration of a single bit would be about
1 millisecond. This hypothesis ﬁts nicely with the facts that many cyclotron frequencies are around
10 Hz and the frequency of neuronal synchronal ﬁring is about kHz.
Quite recently it became clear that TGD predicts counterpart of Tesla’s scalar waves [K57, K58]
. These waves represent a pulse of electric ﬁeld propagating with a velocity of light and an electric
ﬁeld in the direction of propagation. These waves corresponds in TGD to spacetime sheet of ﬁnite
length and duration (L = cT) carrying constant electric ﬁeld and propagating with velocity of light
to the direction of the ﬁeld. This solution type is extremely general and dual to the magnetic ﬂux
tubes. Electrets are one manifestation of these structures in living matter (membrane potential is one
example of this kind of structure).
One could consider the hierarchy of MEs representing geometrically a hierarchical structure of
commands and that memetic code corresponds to the lowest level with bit represented by a electric
pulses whose polarity determines whether ’1’ or ’0’ is in question: very much like in case of computers.
Electret sequences would ultimately give atomic nuclei kicks in a direction depending on the value of
the bit.
What about other synchronous EEG frequencies?
Genuine theta (hippocampal theta which spans both theta and alpha bands) and delta bands could
correspond to more abstract levels of consciousness not directly experienced by us usually. During
slow wave sleep theta and delta bands dominate and the interpretation in terms of the binding of the
mental images to memory representations is highly suggestive. Hence these bands would contribute
to our consciousness in the geometric future rather than in the geometric now.
1. Theta band might relate to long term memory consolidation by a construction of temporal
replicas of ordinary long term memory representations generated already during the wake-up
period. Sleep state is certainly ideal in this respect.
2. Naive extrapolation suggests that delta band memories correspond to a rather long temporal
distance T (that is very low frequency f = 1/T for gravitonic MEs). Delta band memories would
be therefore generated by structures with sizes below the thickness of cell membrane. One could
understand why delta band is strongest in childhood and weakens towards old age. If delta band
memories correspond to very long temporal distances T, it is useless to generate these memories
at the old age since there would be no brain receiving these memories. The long time span of the
delta band memories would explain why childhood memories are stable and why some persons
’return’ to their childhood at the old age. The return to the sensory world of childhood at old
age suggests that delta band memories must be sensory memories. Delta band representations
might even give rise to transpersonal memories experienced during the later lives. The absence
of ordinary sensory input masking delta band memories would explain why earlier life cycles can
be recalled in meditative states.
3. The contribution of theta and delta band memories to our consciousness could also relate to
the third person aspect of consciousness. Theta and delta waves could be associated with the
magnetospheric sensory representations giving rise to multibrained selves. The entanglement
between sleeping brains inducing a loss of personal consciousness would induce a kind of collective
stereo consciousness in which a large number of invididual views about world fuse together would
be in question. The search for correlations between the EEGs of sleepers having a close personal
relationship might be rewarding. For istance, DNA could quantum entangle and give rise to
conscious memories in very long time scale at the level of species.
Note that the presence of synchronous or asynchronous EEG correlate of memory generation is
present also during memory recall does not seem to be necessary since the memory is indeed in the
geometric past.

Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
Questions
One important question is whether positive energy EEG MEs are involved with long term memories or
only with sensory representations (assuming that sensory representations are realized at the magnetic
body). The idea that MEs take care of memories and EEG MEs of sensory representations is attractive
idea at least.
Fascinating questions relate to cognitive representations since these involve p-adic physics. Frontal
lobes are known to be the seat of planning, volition and cognition. Therefore p-adic cognitive represen-
tations, p-adic entanglement and the p-adic selves characterized by positive entanglement negentropy
should be realized in the neural circuits involving frontal lobes. These circuits have been even pro-
posed to be ’conscious circuits’ but this probably reﬂects the erranous identiﬁcation of consciousness
as cognitive consciousness only. Cognitive representations could be realized at magnetic cognitive
canvas using beta frequencies as resonant frequencies and beta MEs would entangle with the points of
the cognitive magnetic canvas p-adic mental images representing intentions and plans. The transfor-
mation of these p-adic mental images to real ones would somehow generate generalized motor actions,
in particular ordinary motor actions. That frontal lobes contain motor areas conforms with this view.
7.3.5
Hippocampus and long term memories
The ﬁndings about hippocampal system provide a good test for the general ideas about long term
memory. For a review about the role of hippocampus in long term memory see [J123] .
Anatomy of hippocampal system
The anatomy of hippocampus is discussed in [J11] : here only very rough summary is given: possible
inaccuracies are due to my amateurish knowledge of brain science.
Hippocampus is located with the inferior medial wall of the temporal lobe posterior to the amyg-
dala.
Hippocampus decomposes into anterior and posterior regions.
Hippocampus consists of a
number of subcomponents, and adjoining structures, such as the parahippocampal gyrys, entorhinal
and perirhinal cortex and uncus. The main body of the hippocampus consists of the detante gyrus
(here brain cells are regenerated), the subiculum and the sectors referred to as CA1,CA2,CA3 and
CA4. The uncus is a bulbar allocortical protrusion located in the anterior-inferior medial part of the
temporal lobe.
There are three major neural pathways leading to and from the hippocampus. These include the
fornix-ﬁmbrial ﬁber system, and a supracallosal pathway which passes through the cingulate, and
via the entorhinal area: this is the mesocortical gateway to the hippocampus. Through the fornix-
ﬁmbrial pathways hippocampus makes major interconnections with the thalamus, septal nuclei, medial
hypothalamus, and exerts either inhibitory or excitatory inﬂuences on these nuclei.
The entorhinal cortex acts to relay information to and from the hippocampus. The hippocam-
pus maintains via the entorhinal cortex interconnections with the neocortical multi-modal associa-
tions areas of the temporal, frontal, and parietal lobes, including surrounding structures, e.g., the
parahippocampal gyrus, and allocortical tissues, the perirhinal cortex, septal nuclei and amygdala.
The parahippocampal gyrus, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, being directly interconnected with the
hippocampus and the neocortex, act to relay input from the neocortical association areas to this
structure.
The entorhinal cortex consists of 7 to 8 layers rather than only 6 layers. The entorhinal cortex
maintains massive interconnections with all multi-modal neocortical association areas (as well as with
the amygdala, hippocampus, septal nuclei, olfactory bulb, etc.) but none of the primary sensory areas
which presumably relates to the fact that hippocampus is responsible for declarative rather than
sensory memories.
Memory deﬁcits and hippocampus
Memory deﬁcits provide important information about the role of hippocampus with respect to the
memory. In anterograde amnesia the ability to generate new long term declarative memories is lost
and it is known that a damage to the hippocampus can cause this defect. Thus it seems that hip-
pocampus is crucially involved with the construction of long term memories. Also the damage to the
medial temporal lobes and subcortical structures such as medial thalamus and mammillary bodies

7.3. Model for long term memories
371
can destroy the ability to generate long term memories. This supports the view that hippocampus is
kind of a central entangler binding together mental images from various parts of brain: most naturally
entanglement occurs along the three neuronal pathways going through hippocampus and presumably
associated with toruslike magnetic ﬂux tubes.
In retrograde amnesia memories about some period of time in past are lost. It seems that this
deﬁcit does not correlate with the damage of hippocampus. Thus the cautious conclusion is that long
term memory recall occurs also elsewhere in brain. The selectivity of the retrograde amnesia suggests
that the notion of the memory ﬁeld applying in the case of short term memory [J68] generalizes. The
brain structures responsible for the receival of long term memories are specialized in the sense that
they entangle with the mental images of the geometric past located only in an interval around certain
temporal distance T. If the memories involve only few reﬂections along a closed magnetic ﬂux loop,
the corresponding MEs have fundamental frequency f = 1/T and correspond to spin glass transition
for microtubules or for 3-dimensional sub-neuronal structures at a length scale between cell size and
cell membrane thickness if the simplest estimate makes sense. This kind of resonant selectivity might
be possible to achieve if the receiving system is driven to the bottom of the spin glass landscape with
a depth which corresponds to the gravitonic energy E = 2πf If memories involves large number of
reﬂections, it is diﬃcult to imagine, how this kind of selectivity could be achieved.
Hippocampus and declarative memory
It is known that there are several memory types and hippocampus is responsible for the construction
of only declarative memories, which are verbal and highly symbolic representations of the geometrical
aspects external world. Hippocampus is not essential for the recognition of familiar objects nor for
procedural/motor memories which are implicit memories. The natural identiﬁcation of declarative
memories is as memories communicated classically using some coding but one cannot exclude sharing
of mental images. Memetic code or its scaled up/scaled down is a good candidate in this respect. The
modulation of hippocampal theta might provide the coding.
Sensory memories can be induced by the electric stimulation of both hippocampus, amygdala and
temporal lobes. This suggests that lower levels of self hierarchy which we do not experience directly can
have sensory memories. The entanglement by negative energy ME with the geometric past giving rise
to an episodal memory is the most natural interpretation for the eﬀect. Neural loops are the geometric
correlates for entanglement at the level of CNS, and timelike quantum entanglement of parts of the
electrically stimulated structures with primary sensory areas with the mediary of these loops should be
involved. If the stimulation is too strong, hallucinations result. In this case the sensory representations
in thhe brain geometrically now are presumably activated and back projection to the sensory organs
would occur. An interesting possibility is that the strength of stimulation correlates with the temporal
distance of the sensory representation in the geometric past activated in the stimulation.
Hippocampus provides spatial and temporal context
The right hippocampus of the taxi drivers in London is enlargened. This supports the view that
hippocampus provides kind of a symbolic map of the spatial layout of the environment. Studies in
animals suggest that hippocampus adds a spatial context to the mental images from cortex entangled
with mental images in subhippocampal structures entangled with the mental images in hippocampus.
The spatial map is based on various spatial cues serving as landmarks. Left hippocampus is in turn
involved with the verbal memories and this suggests that it is responsible for providing a temporal
context and time ordering of events. This suggests that hippocampus is responsible for the temporal
and spatial organization of conscious experience besides generating memory representations. Perhaps
a high level sensory representations at the magnetic body is in question.
Hippocampus is known to contain place cells providing cognitive representations for the objects
of perceptive ﬁeld. These place cells are pyramidal cells containing magnetic crystals which suggests
that they act as projectors to the magnetic memory canvas. All kinds of features could be associated
with these landmarks, and more generally, with the symbolic objects of the memory ﬁeld.
Long term potentiation (LTP) does not occur in hippocampus but hippocampus is highly dynam-
ical with synaptic contacts being generated all the time and even the size of hippocampus continually
changing. It would seem that hippocampus provides by its own dynamical structure a context for
various data coming from cortex, kind of a geometro-symbolic model for the external world. The

372
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
mental image associated with this model of external world quantum entangles with the mental images
in cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, etc...
Not only spatial but also temporal context is important and hippocampus should provide also this.
Purely sensory memories do not carry any information about whether memory is in question or not.
For symbolic representations the situation is diﬀerent. Symbolic representations would be realized
as association sequences, perhaps in the time scale of hippocampal theta such that each 3-surface of
association sequence contains lower level association sequences contains.... Memetic code words of
duration .1 seconds would be at the lowest level and perhaps correspond to mesoscopic features of
Freeman [E1] .
The intronic portion of DNA could provide the fundamental hardwave representation of memes
in terms of sequences of 21 DNA triplets: spoken language would be only a tip of an iceberg if this
picture is correct [K31] . Positive energy em and MEs could realize these memes in the shape of vacuum
current, which at given moment of time is non-deterministic and therefore optimal in this respect.
Memetic code realized in terms of magnetization direction for quark sub-CDs is a further candidate
for realizing the symbolic representations. This highest level representation adding context to the
other data located in the geometric past would entangle via MEs with the brain of the geometric now
in case of episodal memories. The fact that hippocampus is thought to be involved with the trassfer
of items in short term memory to long term memory in cortex conforms with the mirror mechanism.
Entorhinal cortex serves as somekind of a relay station between hippocampus and neocortex.
Entorhinal cortex has very special structure being 7-to-8 layered rather than 6-layered. Entorhinal
cortex maintains rich connections to various multimodal regions in temporal, parietal and frontal
cortices but not to the primary sensory areas. This is consistent with the idea about three-leveled
hierarchy multimodal areas→entorhinal →cortex-hippocampus, with the fact that the mental images
associated with hippocampal memory representations are symbolic rather than sensory, and with the
assumption that multimodal areas, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus entangle.
Hippocampal theta corresponds to EEG frequency range varying from about 4 Hz to 12-14 Hz and
thus spans both theta and alpha bands. Hippocampal theta can be seen as a correlate for the binding of
various cortical and subcortical mental images to a single mental image representing both that aspect
of consciousness which makes possible organized view about space and time and declarative memory.
MEs at hippocampal theta frequencies could project to the magnetic memory canvas providing an
abstract representation about world analogous to sensory representation but without sensory qualia. It
must be emphasized that the memory representation should provide an essential part of our everyday
consciousness making possible space and time categories of everyday conscious experience. Novel and
painful stimuli indeed induce hippocampal theta as well as orienting reactions, learning, selection and
discrimination.
Remote emotions and associations?
Amygdala seems to be responsible for the formation of emotional aspects of the memories in accordance
with entanglement paradigm. Amygdala is known to be sensitive to emotional contextual cues which
can trigger perceptive experiences similar to previous ones.
Associative memories seem to be in
question.
Whether the associative memory is in the geometric now or past is not obvious and timelike
quantum entanglement might perhaps allow to induce remote associations in the geometric past.
If the cue is entangled with the cue in the geometric past, the activation of this cue by quantum
entanglement could activate neural process generating the memory in the geometric past. This kind
of mechanism would provide a general mechanism of active memory retrieval. The active scanning
of memory neurons with memory ﬁelds characterized by diﬀerent values of T would be a second
mechanism of this kind. In fact, there need not be any sharp diﬀerence between ordinary associations
and associations in past.
Memory consolidation and long term potentiation
The notions of memory consolidation and long term potentiation relate to the more standard views
about long term memory and it is interesting to try to interpretthem in TGD framework. Memory
consolidation means the strengthening of memories by ’replaying’ them.
Certainly a repetion of
mental image provides a manner to learn and establishing a long term memory also in TGD. The

7.3. Model for long term memories
373
mere generation of gravitational MEs associated with a given mental image means consolidation: no
modiﬁcation of the existing neural connectivity is needed. Of course, standardized mental images are
probably generated but this is not construction of memories in the strict sense of the word.
Memory consolidation involves hippocampal theta. In TGD framework hippocampal theta is a
correlate for that part of consciousness which gives rise to an organized view about space and time:
not necessarily in the geometric now however. Mirror mechanism implies that this process deﬁnes
automatically memory representations about the state of brain so that memory consolidation is an
automatic side eﬀect.
It has been proposed that during REM sleep hippocampus is ’replaying’ the memories uncon-
sciously [J111] . The fact that there is no sensory input at night time would suggest that sleeping
brain is like an empty magnetic tape freely usable for the memory construction. Theta and delta bands
could relate to the memory representations replayd during sleep period but could be also responsible
for the construction of higher level sensory representations important for non-episodal memories.
There are however objection against the idea that REM sleep is specialized with the replaying.
First, hippocampal theta, believed to be crucial for the formation of long term declarative memories,
is not synchronous during REM sleep. Secondly, during dreams only the posterior portion of the hip-
pocampus is active whereas during learning the active part is the anterior portion of the hippocampus.
TGD based vision suggests a ﬁrst principle explanation for the activity of hippocampus during
sleep and dreams. Both classical communications to the geometric future and the receival of negative
energy MEs from the geometric future require metabolic energy feed. Since the metabolism related
to the motor activity and sensory preception is absent during sleep, the optimal realization of the
long term memories is based on the entanglement with the sleeping brain of the geometric past. This
would also explain why we do not have conscious experiences about memory recalls from the geometric
future. Sleeping brain can also help the situation by performing memory recalls itself. REM sleep
would not be in any special role except that it could make possible episodal sensory memories.
The memories about dream experience fade out rapidly after wake-up. This suggests that the
lengths of the magnetic ﬂux tubes along which classical communications occur during dreams, are
short and therefore also the time span of the resulting declarative memories is brief.
This as it
should be since otherwise dreams would make possible pseudo memories.
We could be conscious
during dreams but would not remember it since long term memories would not be generated during
this period. Alternatively, dream memory representations could be generated by the larger self to
which we are fused during sleep.
The above mentioned ﬁndings about the hippocampal activity
during dreams could mean that magnetic ﬂux loops of declarative memory get longer in posterior-
anterior direction: this would mean a concrete identiﬁcation for the neurophysiological correlates of
the declarative memory ﬁelds. Also the dominating frequency of EEG/ZEG would become lower in
this direction.
The basic question relates to the intepretation of the hippocampal theta. There are two options.
1. Hippocampal theta is associated with the MEs responsible for the classical communications to
the geometric future making possible long term memories.
2. MEs take care of the classical communications to the geometric future (memetic code) whereas
hippocampal theta contributes to the conscious experience of the geometric now by generating
high level sensory representations at the personal magnetic body.
For the latter option hippocampal theta could be also involved with the generation of entanglement
between various parts of brain crucial for the construction of long term memories making possible an
organized view about space and time. This assumption conforms with the idea that EEG rhytms
are responsible for the synchrony and entanglement.
This would not happen during REM sleep
since hippocampal theta is asynchronous during dreaming and during cortical synchrony (not much
sensory input). Visual dream consciousness is indeed sensory consciusness without an organized view
about space and time categories. This applies also to the non-REM verbal dreams. Furthermore, the
desynchronization of both hippocampal and cortical EEGs implies a confused state of mind. This
would suggest that hippocampus indeed contributes also to our consciousness in the geometric now,
and makes possible the organized view about space and time by constructing higher level sensory
representations.
Long term potentiation (LTP) has been suggested as a mechanism by which hippocampus gener-
ates long term memories by strengthening the synaptic communications between neurons. In TGD

374
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
framework this interpretation does not make sense: rather LTP can be seen as a special case of
associative learning which is just gradual modiﬁcation of the brain structure as a response to the
conscious experience. Of course, LTP modiﬁes gradually memory representations but these memory
representations do not contain information about past.
As noticed, LTP does not occur in hippocampus itself. Instead, hippocampus grows rapidly in
neuron number and synaptic connections during long term memory generation. This conforms with
the view that hippocampus is more or less a real time dynamical representation for what might be
called changing context. In particular, new neurons generated in hippocampus could be essential in
representing the context and could generate gravitonic MEs crucial for the entanglement.
Relationship between cortical and hippocampal EEGs
Cortical desynchronization accompanies hippocampal synchronization and vice versa.
The simul-
taneous desynchronization of cortical and hippocampal EEGs involves distractability and hyper-
responsiveness so that person becomes owerwhelmed, confused, and may orient to and approach
several stimuli.
These ﬁndings can be understood in TGD framework.
1. During cortical asynchrony there are good reasons to build long term memories so that hippocam-
pus should be in synchronized state and bind various mental images to long term memories.
2. During cortical synchrony there is nothing to represent as long term memories and hippocampus
can do something else. Perhaps participate in imagination and day dreaming as suggested by
the fact that also during REM sleep hippocampal theta is asynchronous.
3. When both cortical and hippocampal theta are desynchorized, not only the long term memory
representations fail to be generated but also the construction of spatial and temporal context
and this leads to confusion and diﬃculties with orientation to various stimuli.
7.3.6
Microtubuli and long term memory
When I began consciousness theorizing whole-daily around about 1994, I became deeply fascinated
about microtubuli (as probably most others in the ﬁeld of quantum consciousness). I launched oﬀ
by developing a rudimentary model about how microtubuli could act as quantum antennae in the
TGD universe: massless extremals were the key element of the model. Needless to say, too much of
the general theory of consciousness and of biosystems as macroscopic quantum systems needed for a
deeper understanding was unconscious-to-me at that time.
After the rapid self-organization of the theory during this year and still continuing (I am living
last days of August 2002 while writing this), it occurred to me that it might be a good idea to take
a fresh look on the role of the microtubuli.
While re-reading the wonderfully inspiring article of
Nanopoulos dating back to 1995 [J91] , I realized that the TGD based view about macrotemporal
quantum coherence, the mirror mechanism of long term memory, and the quite recent discovery of
cognitive codes and their physical realization, provide the tools for developing a view about the role
of microtubuli in long term memory.
What made me somewhat skeptic about the importance of the microtubuli for our consciousness
was the naive view that the size L of the system system generating the memory increases when the
geometrotemporal distance T of the long term memory increases. Microtubuli would be conscious but
from our point of view this would represent something analogous to bit level in computers.
The understanding of how the macrotemporal quantum coherence is generated however challenged
this view.
TGD Universe is quantum spin glass and spin glass degeneracy is broken only by the
classical gravitational binding energy. Quantum transitions between almost degenerate quantum spin
glass states correspond to frequencies deﬁned by the diﬀerences of the classical gravitational binding
energy and generate gravitational MEs responsible for the quantum mirror mechanism. Gravitational
binding energy increases with the system’s size and this means an eﬀective inversion of the length
scale hierarchy, so that systems like microtubuli can contribute to our conscious experience much more
signicantly than some subsub....subself level at the bottom of the self hierarchy might be expected to
do.

Basic ﬁndings about the correlation between long term memory and microtubuli
A basic diﬀerence between ordinary cell and neuron is that the microtubuli associated with the T
shaped centriole in case of the ordinary cell, are in neuron replaced by long microtubule bundles
starting in a region near nucleus and connecting it to dendrites and axonal ends. The natural guess
is that at least these microtubuli are closely involved with the brain consciousness.
What happens in microtubuli is indeed very intimately related to what happens in synapses.
The minimal modiﬁcation of the standard neuroscience belief system is that microtubuli control how
synapses, still assumed to be responsible for the memory representations, are modiﬁed during learning
identiﬁed as generation of long term memories. In [J91] a lot of basic facts about microtubuli plus the
evidence for the correlation between microtubuli and long term memory is discussed and references
can be found in this article. Here I just summarize the basic points of the discussion of [J91] .
1. The production of tubulin and MT activities correlate with peak learning, memory and expe-
rience in baby chick brains. Experiments with baby rats show that when they ﬁrst open they
eyes, neurons in their visual cortex begin producing vast quantities of tubulin.
2. The experiments with trained goldﬁshes show that the drug colchicine produces retrograde am-
nesia. The interference with MTs responsible for the structural modiﬁcation of certain synapses
is believed to aﬀect memory ﬁxation. In TGD framework one must carefully distinguish between
learning and memory: microtubuli could provide both the long term memory representations
and also control learning by controlling synaptic strengths.
3. The selective dysfunction of animal brain MTs by the drug colchicine causes defects in learning
and memory which mimick the symptons of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). It has been reported
that in rats a continuous MT disruption induced by a chronic colchicine administration results
in a dose-dependent learning deﬁcit, and memory retention is also impaired. It has also been
stressed that these colchicine-induced cognitive defects resemble those of AD, e.g., amnesia of
the recent learning and loss of formerly established memories. These ﬁndings encourage to think
that that microtubuli are involved both with the generation of the memory representations and
long term memory recall by mirror mechanism in accordance with the idea that microtubuli act
as both receiving and sending quantum antennae in the sense that they generate MEs making
possible timelikequantum entanglement. MEs generate coherent photons or gravitons according
to the original deﬁnition of quantum antenna [K55] . Certainly, the antenna which sends is also
optimal for receiving.
4. It has been suggested and also supported by detailed experimental studies that the impairment
of MTs, leading to tangled and dysfunctional neural cytoskeleton, may be one explanation for
the pathogenesis of AD.
5. In speciﬁc hippocampal regions of the brain of schizophrenic patients, distorted neuronal archi-
tecture has been found due to a lack of 2 MAPs. This suggests that the splitting of consciousness
characterizing schizophrenia has a geometric correlate already at the microtubular level: macro-
scopic bound state entanglement responsible for the binding to longlived holistic microtubular
mental images and the generation of memory representations would not occur as they should.
How microtubuli could relate to declarative long term memories?
For several reasons microtubuli are taylor-made for the realization of long term declarative memories in
TGD Universe (the structure of microtubuli is discussed in some detail in [K52] , where the realization
of cognitive codes is discussed). Microtubuli are however not the only candidates: also 2-D membrane
like structures and genuinely 3-D structures could be involved and correspond to diﬀerent types of
long term memories.
1. Microtubuli can entangle with each other and with the surrounding world in conformational
degrees of freedom to yield macrotemporal quantum coherence. Microtubule associated proteins
(MAPs) can mediate naturally bound state entanglement between conformational patterns of
diﬀerent microtubuli. This makes possible macrotemporal quantum coherence and processes
resembling quantum computation when bound states are formed. MAPs can act as switches

376
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
initiating quantum computation and halting it. The simplest possibility is that MAP protein
becomes just disconnected at some levels of the hierarchy of spacetime sheets.
2. Tubulin dimers allow two diﬀerent conformations and the patterns of tubulin conformations are
ideal for binary representations of data natural for the representation of long term declarative
memories. In [K52] a cognitive code explaining the numbers associated with microtubular ge-
ometry is discussed and a model for how the conformational patterns are coded into conscious
experience in the phase transition in which spontaneus electric polarization occurs and forces all
tubulin dimers to the ground state conformation. That microtubuli allow the realization of the
symbolic counterparts of cognitive representations realized using cognitive neutrinos and possibly
also by p-adic MEs, conforms with the fact that colchicine which aﬀects MTs, induces cognitive
defects characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease. The linearity of microtubuli would be obviously
essential and at least parts of the sensory pathways could be responsible for the representations
of these memories.
3. In the standard view about long term memories one cannot identify microtubuli as seats of long
term memory representations. The reason is simply that microtubule conformations are quite
too short-lived for this purpose. This leaves only the identiﬁcation of the synaptic strengths as
a representation of long term memories. In TGD the situation is just the reverse and ﬂexibility
requires fast enough dynamics. The time scale deﬁning sensory resolution is obviously a bottle
neck time scale. The time scale for the phase transition leading to ground state of tubulin dimer
in an external electric ﬁeld and the time scale related to the control of the external electric
ﬁeld at the microtubular spacetime sheet are the most obvious guesses. The ﬁrst time scale
should be of order of the time scale of conformational dynamics, about nanosecond. The latter
time scale would be basically the duration of nerve pulse if nerve pulses are responsible for the
phase transition in question. In TGD framework the modiﬁcation of synaptic strengths can
be more naturally seen as representing generation of new ’habit routines’ rather than memory
representations which are much more involved and information rich.
4. Microtubuli are ideal for quantum mirror mechanism of long term memories. As already found,
in case of spherical structures the dependence of gravitational binding energy on size of the
structure is Egr ∝L5, whereas the gravitational binding energy depends on the length L of a
linear structure as Egr ∝L. For membrane like structures Egr ∝L3. Since microtubule lengths
vary in the range 10 nm- 1 mm, this means that the temporal distance T ∝1/L of long term
memory varies between 32 years 2.8 hours (very roughly; increase of the overall time scale due
to the fact that increment of the gravitational binding energy in the transition is smaller than
the gravitational binding energy itself). Inside axons microtubuli can bind to longer structures
by MAPs and even meter sized structures associated with sensory pathways are possible. This
lowers the lower bound for the time span to 10 seconds. The longest microtubuli are responsible
for the representation of the shortest term memories realizable in this manner.
Of course,
memory circuits should regenerate again and again microtubular memory representation and in
this sense synaptic strengths become an essential part of the memory representation.
5. Colchicine aﬀects both memory recall and memory generation. This inspires the working hy-
pothesis that microtubuli of a given length L ∝1/T in the geometric past entangle with a
microtuble of same length in the geometric now during memory recall. For instance, the re-
ceiver in the geometric now could correspond to a postsynaptic microtubule whereas the sender
in the geometric past corresponds to a presynaptic tubule. This is not the only alternative,
receiving cells could be even glial cells.
6. That the memories of childhood are the most stable ones could be interpreted as reﬂecting the
fact the microtubuli act both as receiving and sending quantum antennae, and that the long
microtubuli responsible for generating the short term memory representations and for receiving
them deteriorate towards the old age with much higher probability than the shorter ones. It
could be possible to induce selective amnesiae restricted to memories with a temporal distance
∼T by a treatment which aﬀects microtubuli of given length ∼L ∝1/T.
7. Microtubuli could be also ideal for the communication of non-episodal memories involving clas-
sical communication by ultra slow MEs perhaps accompanied by Ca++ waves known to have an

7.3. Model for long term memories
377
extremely wide velocity spectrum. Ca++ ions are associated with the outer surface of the micro-
tubuli and dynamically comparable to a crop ﬁeld in a wind. Ultra-slow orientational waves for
these Ca++ ions representing sensory inputs and propagating along axons could make possible
a classical communication of data from the geometric past as declarative memories. For sensory
pathways the sequences of microtubuli could have a total length of order one meter. For the
average length L0 = 10 µm of the microtubule in brain, the time span T0 = 10 seconds would
give v0 ∼1µm/s, a typical velocity of in cellular level. In this case 10 nm length of microtubule
would correspond to 10−2 seconds of time. This would mean that roughly 13 parallel sequences
of 13 bits of information about 10 millisecond period. The bit rate of one bit per millisecond
corresponds to the information storage capacity of the memetic code. For longer time intervals T
and microtubule lengths L the bit rate would scale like (L/L0)×(T0/T) = v/v0. For T = 1 year
and L = L0 one would have roughly one bit per hour. It seems that this mechanism can be at
work only for short term memories whereas long term memories would involve closed magnetic
loops.
Relation to the general model of long term memories
It is interesting to relate the proposed model with the general model of long term memories.
1. Long term memory is lost when tubulins return to ground state unless there is some mechanism
regenerating the conformational state. In brain the function of neuronal loops generating the
nerve pulse patterns repeatedly would take care of regenerating the memory representation. If
this view is correct, then also memories of childhood involve this kind of continual regeneration.
Sensory pathways do give rise to long term memories unless the feedback from brain to primary
sensory organs (otoacoustic sounds and the movement of eyes during REM sleep) regenerates
these memory representations. During dream long term memories correspond to small value of
T: does this allow to conclude that the feedback to the primary sensory organs during dreams
results in long term memories with T about few minutes? The maximation of the lengths of
the sensory pathways (left side of the body is connected to right brain hemisphere and vice
versa) would relate to the maximization of the representational capacity if this mechanism is at
work. Notice that the continual regeneration of memories with say temporal distance of T = 15
minutes does not seem sensical since these memories would not be received by that part of
the 4-D brain which corresponds to the p-adic-to-real phase transition front. The most natural
assumption is that sensory representations are regenerated for time interval of order T so that
the maximal values of T and stablest memories correspond to relatively short microtubuli in the
interior of neuron.
2. Hippocampus is believed to be crucial for the generation of long term declarative memories
and responsible for spatio-temporal organization of perceptive ﬁeld. Hippocampus could act
as a kind of entanglement center entangling with ’features’ at various brain areas and project
them to the sensory magnetic canvas (the episodal component representing spatial relationships
might accompany also non-episodal memories!).
Feature subselves would have microtubular
selves as subselves: this would mean entanglement between hippocampal and other microtubular
memory representations. The microtubuli acting as central entanglers in hippocampus should
be relatively short, with lengths not much longer than the length determined by the lower bound
for temporal distance T for long term memories. The maximal length L of hippocampal axons
should correspond to this T and L ∼10−2 meters from the size of the hippocampus might be
a reasonable guess giving a time scale of about 15 minutes (these estimates are just orders of
magnitude).
3. The recall of long term memories could basically correspond to a transition of a neuronal mi-
crotubule to a higher energy state by an emission of negative energy ME. The process would be
preceded by the emission of a p-adic ME representing the intention to remember and transformed
to a real negative energy MEs in the jump to a higher energy state. The neuronal/astrocytic
microtubules of the right brain hemisphere could be specialized to send/receive negative energy
MEs, whereas the astrocytic/neuronal microtubules of the left hemisphere would be special-
ized to send/receive positive energy MEs. Of course, this is just a naive guess inspired by the

378
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
right/left–holistic/reductionic dichotomy. What is however clear that microtubuli with abnor-
mally small metabolic energy feed would be responsible for generating long term memory recalls
and those with abnormally large energy feed responsible for generating long term memories.
4. Tubulin dimers correspond to the Mersenne prime p = Mk = 2k −1, k = 13, and the n-ary 13-
adic time scale nearest to p-adic prime nearest to .1 second time scale of the memetic code word
is T(20, 13) ≃.8 seconds whereas single bit lasts for T(20, 13)/13 ≃61 milliseconds. .8 seconds
is rather natural time scale from the point of view of human consciousness.
Corresponding
frequencies are 1.25 Hz in delta band, and 16.25 Hz in the lower end of the beta band which
conforms with the fact that cognition correlates with the beta band activity of EEG. That delta
frequency alone does not give rise to conscious experience would be due to the fact that no phase
transition giving rise to a conscious experience occurs if all tubulins possess same ground state
conformation. The facts that delta band weakens during ageing and also memory generation
mechanisms deteriorate towards the old age, conform with the idea that this band is responsible
for the generation of memory codewords. If this view is correct, hippocampal theta should be
responsible for the binding of mental images rather than coding of our long term memories. Of
course, also a lower level representations in time scale of hippocampal theta could be in question.
5. At this stage it is not possible to answer the question whether microtubuli correspond to subselves
or subsub....selves. If the entangled microtubuli correspond to our subselves, the microtubuli
belonging to diﬀerent neurons should be able to entangle with each other. This requires the
presence of join along boundaries bond contacts between pre- and postsynaptic microtubuli.
MEs with lengths of neuron length scale could serve as this kind of contacts and generate time
like entanglement between the microtubuli of neurons along the neural pathway.
What about eﬀectively 2-D and 3-D memory representations?
Microtubuli need not be solely responsible for our long term memory representations.
The fact
that microtubuli seem to correlate with cognition and declarative memories which involve typically
representations linear with respect to time suggests that the eﬀective dimension D of the structure
involved determines the character of the long term memory and also that of sensory experience.
Moreover, it is quite possible that a large number of entangled neurons results in a kind of ’stereo
consciousness’ fusing a large number of slightly diﬀerent views about the same sensory input. This
would mean large number of entangling Grandmother neurons.
1. Cell membranes consist of a large number of parallel rather than serially ordered units. Hence
cell membranes could be responsible for the storage of sensory memories, which are 2-dimensional
at the basic level, say visual images. The neuron size of 10−4 meters corresponds to the lower
bound of about millisecond for T ∝L3.
2. Three-dimensional blobs of biomatter in length scale range 1 micron-10 nanometers span the
range 1 millisecond-32 years for temporal distance T. This allows to consider the possibility
that 3-D structures could be also responsible for long term memory representations. If one takes
seriously the dimensional rule, 3-D structures should give to genuinely three-dimensional sensory
memories and make 3-D spatial imagination and sensory experience possible. It is not obvious
whether neurons contain any 3-D lattice like structures besides liquid crystal blobs of ordered
water. Eﬀectively 3-D structures could also result as composites of 2-D structures.

Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1, dark matter hierarchy,
and long term memories
This section is devoted to the progress that has occurred during the period 2004-2006 and represents
new material which has not yet been fully integrated with the older material. The realization that the
von Neumann algebra known as a hyper-ﬁnite factor of type II1 is tailor made for quantum TGD has
led to a considerable progress in the understanding of the mathematical structure of the theory and
these algebras provide a justiﬁcation for several ideas introduced earlier on basis of physical intuition.
One of the most important outcomes is a prediction of a hierarchy of quantum phases with arbitrarily

7.4. Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1, dark matter hierarchy, and long term memories379
large values of quantized Planck constant identiﬁed as dark matter and assumed to be the quintessence
of living matter.
7.4.1
Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 and quantization of Planck constant
Hyper-ﬁnite factor of type II1 has a canonical realization as an inﬁnite-dimensional Cliﬀord algebra
and the obvious guess is that it corresponds to the algebra spanned by the gamma matrices of the
conﬁguration space of 3-surfaces (”world of classical worlds”). As a matter fact, it seems that the
inﬁnite-dimensional character of this algebra implies the rest of TGD. 4-D space-time, imbedding space
M 4 × CP2, and the entire quantum TGD could emerge from the extension of the hyper-ﬁnite factor
of type II1 to a local algebra. This extension is local with respect to an octonionic coordinate whose
non-associativity guarantees that the algebra does not reduce back to a mere hyper-ﬁnite factor of
type II1. The dynamics of quantum TGD would follow from the associativity condition: in particular,
space-time surface would be maximal associative or co-associate sub-manifolds of imbedding space.
The quantization of Planck constants assignable to M 4 and CP2 degrees of freedom as integer
multiples of the ordinary Planck constant is strongly suggestive in this framework and the phases
with large Planck constant are interpreted as a dark matter quantum controlling ordinary matter in
living matter. The average geometric durations of quantum jumps are naturally quantized as multiples
of the integer characterizing M 4 Planck constant. This allows the reduction of the notion of self to
that of quantum jump at higher level of hierarchy. A strong quantitative prediction for the preferred
geometric durations of quantum jumps emerges.
The topology of the many-sheeted space-time encourages the generalization of the notion of quan-
tum entanglement in such a manner that unentangled systems can possess entangled sub-systems.
This makes possible sharing and fusion of mental images central for TGD inspired theory of con-
sciousness. These concepts ﬁnd a justiﬁcation from the quantum measurement theory for hyper-ﬁnite
factors of type II1.
Also the notions of resolution and monitoring pop up naturally in this framework. p-Adic proba-
bilities relate very naturally to hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 and extend the expressive power of the
ordinary probability theory. p-Adic thermodynamics with conformal cutoﬀis very natural for hyper-
ﬁnite factors of type II1 and explains p-adic length scale hypothesis p ≃2k, k prime characterizing
exponentially smaller p-adic length scale.
7.4.2
Dark matter hierarchy
The identiﬁcation of dark matter as phases having large value of Planck constant [K73, K92, K20] led
to a vigorous evolution of ideas still continuing while I am writing this addendum to the original text.
Entire dark matter hierarchy with levels labelled by increasing values of Planck constant is predicted,
and in principle TGD predicts the values of Planck constant if physics as a generalized number
theory vision is accepted [K92] . Also a good educated guess for the spectrum of Planck constants
emerges. The implications are non-trivial already at the level of hadron physics and nuclear physics
and imply that condensed matter physics and nuclear physics are not completely disjoint disciplines as
reductionism teaches us. One condensed matter application is a model of high Tc superconductivity
predicting that the basic length scales of cell membrane and cell as scales are inherent to high Tc
superconductors.
Living matter and dark matter
Living matter as ordinary matter quantum controlled by the dark matter hierarchy has turned out to
be a particularly successful idea. The hypothesis has led to models for EEG predicting correctly the
band structure and even individual resonance bands and also generalizing the notion of [J27] [K21]
. Also a generalization of the notion of genetic code emerges resolving the paradoxes related to the
standard dogma [K40, K21] . A particularly fascinating implication is the possibility to identify great
leaps in evolution as phase transitions in which new higher level of dark matter emerges [K21] .
It seems safe to conclude that the dark matter hierarchy with levels labelled by the values of
Planck constants explains the macroscopic and macro-temporal quantum coherence naturally. That
this explanation is consistent with the explanation based on spin glass degeneracy is suggested by
following observations. First, the argument supporting spin glass degeneracy as an explanation of

380
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
the macro-temporal quantum coherence does not involve the value of ℏat all. Secondly, the failure
of the perturbation theory assumed to lead to the increase of Planck constant and formation of
macroscopic quantum phases could be precisely due to the emergence of a large number of new degrees
of freedom due to spin glass degeneracy. Thirdly, the phase transition increasing Planck constant has
concrete topological interpretation in terms of many-sheeted space-time consistent with the spin glass
degeneracy.
Jones inclusions and quantization of Planck constant
The Cliﬀord algebra spanned by gamma matrices of inﬁnite-dimensional space deﬁnes standard exam-
ple of a von Neumann algebra known as hyper-ﬁnite factor of type II1. The characteristic property of
this algebra is that unit matrix has unit trace. Jones inclusions of hyperﬁnite factors of type II1 com-
bined with simple anyonic arguments turned out to be the key to the uniﬁcation of existing heuristic
ideas about the quantization of Planck constant [K24] .
1. Quantum TGD emerges from the inﬁnite-dimensional Cliﬀord algebra extended to an analog
of a local gauge algebra with respect to hyper-octonionic coordinate [K92] . In particular, the
notions space-time as a hyper-quaternionic four-surface of imbedding space emerges.
2. One can understand how and why Planck constant is quantized and gives an amazingly simple
formula for the separate Planck constants assignable to M 4 and CP2 and appearing as scaling
constants of their metrics as integer multiples of standard value ℏ0 of Planck constant: ℏ(M 4) =
naℏ0 and ℏ(CP2) = nbℏ0. This in terms of a mild generalization of standard Jones inclusions
[K92] . The emergence of imbedding space means that the scaling factor of these metrics given
by the scaling factor of Planck constant have spectrum: their is no landscape as in M-theory.
Also the fusion of real and various p-adic variants of imbedding space along common rational
(algebraic) points is involved.
3. In ordinary phase Planck constants of M 4 and CP2 are same and have their standard values.
Large Planck constant phases correspond to situations in which a transition to a phase in which
quantum groups occurs.
These situations correspond to standard Jones inclusions in which
Cliﬀord algebra is replaced with a sub-algebra of its G-invariant elements. G is product Ga ×Gb
of subgroups of SL(2, C) and SU(2)L × ×U(1) which also acts as a subgroup of SU(3). Space-
time sheets are n(Gb)-fold coverings of M 4 and n(Ga)-fold coverings of CP2 generalizing the
picture which has emerged already. An elementary study of these coverings ﬁxes the values of
scaling factors of M 4 and CP2 Planck constants to orders of the maximal cyclic sub-groups.
Mass spectrum is invariant under these scalings.
4. This predicts automatically arbitrarily large values of Planck constant and assigns the preferred
values of Planck constant to quantum phases q = exp(iπ/n) expressible using only iterated
square root operation: these correspond to polygons obtainable by compass and ruler construc-
tion with integer n expressible as n = 2k Q
i Fsi, where Fsi = 22si +1 are distinct Fermat primes:
the lowest Fermat primes are given by 3, 5, 17, 127, 216 +1. In particular, experimentally favored
values of ℏin living matter should correspond to these special values of Planck constant. This
model reproduces also the other aspects of the general vision. The subgroups of SL(2, C) in
turn can give rise to re-scaling of SU(3) Planck constant. The most general situation can be
described in terms of Jones inclusions for ﬁxed point subalgebras of number theoretic Cliﬀord
algebras deﬁned by Ga × Gb ⊂SL(2, C) × SU(2).
5. These inclusions (apart from those for which Ga contains inﬁnite number of elements) are repre-
sented by ADE or extended ADE diagrams depending on the value of index. The group algebras
of these groups give rise to additional degrees of freedom which make possible to construct the
multiplets of the corresponding gauge groups. For β ≤4 the gauge groups An, D2n, E6, E8
are possible so that TGD seems to be able to mimick these gauge theories.
For β = 4 all
ADE Kac Moody groups are possible and again mimicry becomes possible: TGD would be kind
of universal physics emulator but it would be anyonic dark matter which would perform this
emulation.

7.4. Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1, dark matter hierarchy, and long term memories381
7.4.3
Dark matter hierarchy and the notion of self
The introduction of dark matter matter hierarchy forces to also reconsider the deﬁnition of self and
in the following the original deﬁnition and modiﬁed deﬁnition are discussed. The vision about dark
matter hierarchy as a hierarchy deﬁned by quantized Planck constants leads to a more reﬁned view
about self hierarchy and hierarchy of moments of consciousness [K20, K21] .
The hierarchy of dark matter levels is labelled by the values of Planck constant having quantized
but arbitrarily large values. It seems that the most important hierarchy comes as ℏ(k) = λkℏ0, where
λ ≃2k is integer. The larger the value of Planck constant, the longer the subjectively experienced
duration and the average geometric duration T(k) ∝λk of the quantum jump.
Dark matter hierarchy suggests a modiﬁcation of the notion of self, in fact a reduction of the
notion of self to that of quantum jump alone. Each self involves a hierarchy of dark matter levels,
and one is led to ask whether the highest level in this hierarchy corresponds to single quantum jump
rather than a sequence of quantum jumps. This indeed looks extremely natural and the hypothesis
that self remains un-entangled for a longer duration than single quantum jump un-necessary. It is
perhaps un-necessary to emphasize that the reduction of the notion of self to that of quantum jump
means conceptual economy and somewhat ironically, would also a return to the original hypothesis
but with a quantized Planck constant.
The averaging of conscious experience over quantum jumps would occur only for sub-selves at
lower levels of dark matter hierarchy and these mental images would be ordered, and single moment
of consciousness would be experienced as a history of events. One can ask whether even entire life
cycle could be regarded as a single quantum jump at the highest level so that consciousness would
not be completely lost even during deep sleep. This would allow to understand why we seem to know
directly that this biological body of mine existed yesterday.
The fact that we can remember phone numbers with 5 to 9 digits supports the view that self corre-
sponds at the highest dark matter level to single moment of consciousness. Self would experience the
average over the sequence of moments of consciousness associated with each sub-self but there would
be no averaging over the separate mental images of this kind, be their parallel or serial. These mental
images correspond to sub-selves having shorter wake-up periods than self and would be experienced as
being time ordered. Hence the digits in the phone number are experienced as separate mental images
and ordered with respect to experienced time.
If one accepts the hypothesis that CP2 time deﬁnes the typical geometric duration of quantum
jump then moments of consciousness with duration longer than CP2 time would be associated with
dark matter. This would require quite huge value of n for human consciousness and does not seem
a plausible option since the time scale of .1 seconds corresponds to integer n ≃2256 ≃1038. A more
reasonable looking option is that n-ary p-adic time scales T(n, p) for a given value ℏ= mℏ0 deﬁne
the typical geometric duration so that for a given prime p one would have the hierarchy T(m, n, p) =
mTp(n) = m√pnTCP2 of geometric durations of moment of consciousness, with favored values of m
given by m = 2k Q
i Fsi: as already explained, Fsi = 22si +1 are distinct Fermat primes and the lowest
Fermat primes are given by 3, 5, 17, 127, 216+1. TCP2 corresponds to CP2 time about 104 Planck times.
The geometric durations give a natural ﬁrst guess for the duration of long term memories. Second
interpretation is as the increase of geometric time coordinate in single quantum jump in the drift
towards geometric future which should accompanying quantum jump making possible to understand
the experience about ﬂow of time.
7.4.4
The time span of long term memories as signature for the level of
dark matter hierarchy
If one accepts the hypothesis that CP2 time deﬁnes the typical geometric duration of quantum jump
then moments of consciousness with duration longer than CP2 time would be associated with dark
matter.
This would require quite huge value of n for human consciousness and does not seem a
plausible option since the time scale of .1 seconds corresponds to integer n ≃2256 ≃1038. A more
reasonable looking option is that n-ary p-adic time scales T(n, p) for a given value ℏ= mℏ0 deﬁne
the typical geometric duration so that for a given prime p one would have the hierarchy T(m, n, p) =
mTp(n) = m√pnTCP2 of geometric durations of moment of consciousness, with favored values of m
given by m = 2k Q
i Fsi: as already explained, Fsi = 22si +1 are distinct Fermat primes and the lowest
Fermat primes are given by 3, 5, 17, 127, 216+1. TCP2 corresponds to CP2 time about 104 Planck times.

382
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
The geometric durations give a natural ﬁrst guess for the duration of long term memories. Second
interpretation is as the increase of geometric time coordinate in single quantum jump in the drift
towards geometric future which should accompanying quantum jump making possible to understand
the experience about ﬂow of time.
Higher levels of dark matter hierarchy provide a neat quantitative view about self hierarchy and
its evolution [K21] . EEG frequencies correspond at this level dark Josephson photon energies above
the thermal threshold so that thermal noise is not a problem anymore. Various levels of dark matter
hierarchy would naturally correspond to higher levels in hierarchy of consciousness and the typical
duration of life cycle would give an idea about the level in question. The level in the would determine
also the time span of long term memories as discussed in [K21] .
The emergence of these levels must have meant evolutionary leaps since long term memory is also
accompanied by ability to anticipate future in the same time scale. This picture would suggest that
the basic diﬀerence between us and our cousins is not at the level of genome as it is usually understood
but at the level of the hierarchy of magnetic bodies [K40, K21] . In fact, higher levels of dark matter
hierarchy motivate the introduction of the notions of super-genome and hyper-genome. The genomes
of entire organ can join to form super-genome expressing genes coherently. Hyper-genomes would
result from the fusion of genomes of diﬀerent organisms and collective levels of consciousness would
express themselves via hyper-genome and make possible social rules and moral.
Quantum classical correspondence predicts that the arrow of subjective time is somehow mapped
to that for the geometric time. The detailed mechanism for how the arrow of psychological time
emerges has however remained open. Also the notion of self is problematic.

Remote metabolism, long term memory, and zero energy ontology
The notion of negative energy signals and time mirror mechanism emerged before zero energy ontology.
Since the mechanisms of remote metabolism, of memory, and of intentional action rely on time mirror
mechanism, one should check that this mechanism is indeed consistent with zero energy ontology.
Zero energy ontology could also yield new insights to these mechanisms.
Zero energy ontology
Zero energy ontology states that physical states have vanishing net conserved quantum numbers and
states decompose to positive and negative energy state and that the latter one can be said to be
located in the geometric future with of the positive energy state at the time-like boundary of the
space-time sheet representing the system. It is possible to speak about energy of the system if one
identiﬁes it as the average positive energy for the positive energy part of the system.
The matrix (”M-matrix”) representing time-like entanglement coeﬃcients between positive and
negative energy states uniﬁes the notions of S-matrix and density matrix since it can be regarded as a
complex square root of density matrix expressible as a product of real squared of density matrix and
unitary S-matrix. The system can be also in thermal equilibrium so that thermodynamics becomes
a genuine part of quantum theory and thermodynamical ensembles cease to be practical ﬁctions of
the theorist. In this case M-matrix represents a superposition of zero energy states for which positive
energy state has thermal density matrix.
1. If the positive energy parts of zero energy states appearing in the superposition have only single
value of energy, the notion of remote metabolism is certainly well-deﬁned. Even in the case that
the system is thermalized remote metabolism makes sense since average energy can be increased
by remote metabolism. One can even imagine a statistical variant of the process in which the
temperature increases.
2. The critical question is whether crossing symmetry prevails in the sense that the positive energy
signal propagating to the geometric future is equivalent to a negative energy signal propagating
to geometric past. The eigen modes of the modiﬁed Dirac operator appearing in the ﬁrst principle
formulation of quantum TGD are characterized by the eigenvalues λ, which are complex. |λ|2 has
interpretation as a conformal weight mathematically analogous to a vacuum expectation value
of Higgs ﬁeld. There are reasons to believe that the eigenvalues relate closely to the zeros of
Riemann zeta and/or its generalizations. If the eigenvalue and its complex conjugate correspond

7.4. Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1, dark matter hierarchy, and long term memories383
to a state and its phase conjugate, crossing symmetry fails and would mean also breaking of
time reversal symmetry.
Is zero energy ontology consistent with time mirror mechanism
Energy conservation and geometric arrow of time poses strong conditions on the mechanism.
If
positive energy part of state sends negative energy signal, then negative energy part of state must
send a compensating positive energy signal. Furthermore, positive (negative) energy signals propagate
towards geometric future (past).
1. If only single space-time sheet is involved, either negative energy signal S−: X4
−→Y 4
−or positive
energy signal S+: X4
+ →Y 4
−is possible. The energy of both states is reduced in magnitude. For
instance, this process tends to reduce destroy long term memories represented as bit sequences
with bit represented by population inverted laser system.
2. Second possibility is that X4 are Y 4 are disjoint and X4 is in the geometric future of Y 4.
The ﬁrst possibility is S+: X4
+ →Y 4
−and negative energy signal S−: X4
−→Y 4
−: the energy of
both X4 and Y 4 is reduced in this case.
Second possibility is S−: X4
+ →Y 4
+ and S+: Y 4
−→X4
−. X4 would suck energy from Y 4 in the
geometric past. This option could correspond to both remote metabolism, memory recall, and
intentional action. The presence of topological light ray connecting two systems would be also
a correlate for time-like quantum entanglement making possible sharing and fusion of mental
images and creating a sensation about ﬂow of time just like it creates sensation of depth in stereo
vision by fusion of right and left visual ﬁelds. Depending on the sign of the energy of the signal
one would have memory or precognition. Precognition would require use of metabolic energy
and this might be one reason for why it is rather rare.
3. Suppose next that the zero energy space-time sheet, call it X4, is inside larger space-time sheet,
call it Y 4: X4 ⊂Y 4. In this case one can have S−: X4
+ →Y 4
+ accompanied by S+: X4
−→Y 4
−.
X4 ⊂Y 4 would suck energy from a larger system Y 4. It is of course possible to replace signals
with signals of opposite energy in opposite time direction.
A possible interpretation is as a metabolic charging of smaller space-time sheets by sucking
energy from longer scales or by active pumping of energy to shorter scales. The transformation
of long wavelength photons with large Planck constant to short wavelength photons with smaller
Planck constant is an analogous process and might realize metabolic charging in biology. For
instance, Sun-Earth system could correspond to Y 4 and biosphere to X4.
To sum up, zero energy ontology completes the picture in the sense that it also provides a process
making possible metabolic charging.
Thermodynamical considerations
It is not at all obvious whether the proposed picture is consistent with the standard thermodynamics.
The transfer of energy from long to shorter length scales making possible to gain metabolic energy
and realize the mechanism of long term memory indeed seems a genuinely new element. This pro-
cess resembles dissipation in the sense that energy is transferred from long to short length scales.
In an approach to thermal equilibrium temperature gradients are however reduced whereas remote
metabolism favors the active generation of ”hot spots”.
These considerations relate closely to the notions of entropy and syntropy by Italian mathematician
Luigi Fantappie [J62] assigned with the two arrows of time. I learned from the work of Fantappie in
SSE conference held in R¨oros from Antonella Vannini [J135] and Ulisse Di [J46] [J46] .The discovery of
Fantappie was that in living systems entropic processes seem to be accompanied by syntropic processes
which seem to be ﬁnalistic. He assigned these processes to the advanced solutions of wave equations.
It would seem that entropy and syntropy do not relate directly to the notion of remote metabolism.
1. Syntropy growth would indeed be the mirror image of entropy growth associated with negative
energy mirror image of positive energy dynamics. This dynamics could be seen as sequences of
downwards scalings leading from long time scale to short time scale. This sequence would deﬁne

384
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
time sequences proceeding in opposite directions of time for positive and negative energy parts
of states. Thus entropy growth would be accompanied by syntropy growth.
2. Syntropy growth could be also seen as a consequence of generalized second law applying with
respect to subjective time and growth of syntropy would be growth of entropy but manifesting
itself at space-time level in reversed direction of geometric time. For instance, the spontaneous
assembly of bio-molecules from their parts could be seen as a decay process in the reverse
direction of geometric time controlled by phase conjugate control signals.
3. Remote metabolism as generation of ”hot spots” does not seem to reduce to these notions and
might represent a genuine breaking of standard thermodynamical view about the world.
One must also distinguish the notions of entropy and syntropy from the notion of number theo-
retic entanglement negentropy N assignable with quantum entanglement with algebraic entanglement
probabilities.
1. N is deﬁned as the maximum of the p-adic entanglement negentropy N(p) as a function of the
p-adic prime p and thus assigns to an entangled system a unique prime pmax. N(p) is obtained
by replacing in the deﬁnition of the Shannon entropy the argument of logarithm with its p-adic
norm. N is in general positive and thus deﬁnes a genuine measure of information.
2. The non-negative negentropy deﬁned in this manner characterizes entanglement as a carrier of
information rather than the state of either of systems and has nothing to do with the ordinary
(non-positive) entropy characterizing the lack of knowledge about the state of either subsystem.
Negentropy Maximization Principle [K44] favors the increase of the number theoretic negentropy
and thus formation of entanglement quantum systems and generation of quantum coherence.
Depending on the character of entanglement negentropic entanglement might be interpreted as
a correlate for some conscious experience with positive content: say experience of understanding
(time-like entanglement implying causal structure), of love (space-like entanglement), etc...
It is not obvious to me whether the remote metabolism as a manner to build hot spots and diversity
could be reduced to NMP or whether it should be regarded as something completely independent.
7.4.6
Applying computer analogy to the model for long term memories
The general model for long term memories does not say anything detailed about how memory recall
can take place eﬀectively. Taking seriously the idea that we made computers as our images, one can
try to see whether the basic facts about memory storage and recall in the case of computers could
help to guess how the memory recall is realized in TGD Universe.
The basic metaphor is 4-D brain as a kind of magnetic tape in time direction carrying memories
as a text consisting of letters with ﬁxed width (temporal duration) and decomposing into paragraphs,
sections, etc... just like written text. Rhythms of generalized EEG would realize the decomposition
to letters, and larger sub-units.
Computer analogy suggests also the analog of directory system allowing an easy and rapid access
to a particular record in a particular ﬁle. Fractality would automatically make possible fractally scaled
down variants of the system with life span scaled down to a second but details absent or not visible
in the cognitive resolution available.
Web suggests a link system in temporal direction realizing temporal associations automatically
and topological light rays which would be vacuum extremals in passive state could realize the link
system.
The two kinds of memories seem to be closely related
There are two kinds of memories. The proposal is that the sharing of mental images of the geometric
past gives rise to episodal memories, re-experiences. These memories would correspond to mental
images identiﬁed as quantum jumps containing quantum jumps containing... for zero energy states.
This hierarchy would correspond to dark matter hierarchy and hierarchy of Planck constant.
One can criticize this idea.

7.4. Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1, dark matter hierarchy, and long term memories385
1. Does the quantum entangled zero energy state of the magnetic body and brain of the geometric
past really give rise to the episodal memory as sharing of mental images? The sharing aspect
would certainly give rise to experience of time as analog for the depth experience in stereo
vision assumed to result from the sharing of left and right visual mental images.
But why
not interpret this kind of state as a representation for a ”law of nature” telling that state
pairs in the superposition of states are causally related? Isn’t state function reduction reducing
entanglement necessary to experience sharp sensory qualia? The answer to these questions is
that it is entangled system whose qualia are in question, not either of the individual systems.
In quantum context this would mean that the sum of observables giving rise to the qualia of
separate systems are measured in quantum jump.
2. What it really means to have an episodal memory? For sharing of mental images by space-
like entanglement of sub-selves the space-time correlate is the join along boundaries bonds
connecting the space-time sheets condensed at larger disjoint space-time sheets. In the case
of episodal memories it would seem that the experiencer-now and and experiencer-then must
correspond to disjoint space-time sheets and containing smaller space-time sheets connected by
a topological light ray. Hence also classical communications would be an essential part of the
mechanism of memory and the distinction between episodal and declarative memories does not
seem so sharp as thought originally.
3. The mere re-experiencing of events of the geometric past by quantum entangling with a sub-
system representing sensory mental image is not very eﬀective mechanism. A more eﬀective
manner to remember is to represent memories symbolically as bit sequences with bits repre-
sented as population inverted state and ground state of laser (say many-sheeted laser). In this
case metabolism is required to keep the representations intact.
Memory recall as communications between magnetic body and brain of geometric past
Memory recall would be communications between magnetic body and brain of the geometric past.
Magnetic body can be visualized as a kind of onion with several layers: the larger the radius of layer
the longer temporal distance T to the geometric past it corresponds. In memory recall the size of
the active layer would correspond naturally to the temporal distance to the brain of the geometric
past where the memory is stored. The frequencies of large Planck constant photons involved with
communications would correspond to this distance (f ∼1/T) and a de-coherence to photons with
much shorter wavelength would take place in the process.
Neuroscience suggests that theta waves, which still have wavelength of order Earth size scale, are
involved. They could result in de-coherence of waves with wavelength of order λ = cT reducing the
value of Planck constant.
The most primitive memory recall would rely on the scanning of brain of geometric past by using
negative energy signal with a slowly varying carrier frequency. One can however consider MEs which
are present permanently as vacuum extremals and activated to non-vacuum extremals during memory
recall: this would mean a realization of a link system.
How could one realize links in time-like direction?
Links are certainly one of the most powerful functions of the web. Links are always present and
activated when used.
The obvious counterpart for the web link would be a topological light ray
connecting two subsystems with a time-like separation.
Topological light rays can also reduce to
vacuum extremals and the activation of the the link could correspond to a feeding of energy to a
topological light ray deforming it to a non-vacuum extremal. This kind of links would be naturally
associated with long term memories and would make it un-necessary to scan the entire geometric past
in the search of a particular episodal or declarative memory.
Dreams and building up of copies of memories
Important memories should be stored in several copies since would increase the probability that the
scanning of the geometric past allows to build ME bridge to the subsystem representing the memory

386
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
mental image. Memories represented as bit sequences can be also lost in a repetitive recall since they
might fail to receive metabolic energy feed.
Dreams might be a manner to build this kind of copies. The copies built up in this manner can
involve a considerable processing and it could even happen that for painful memories large number of
less painful variants are constructed. Also the original memory could be transformed to less painful
during the period of time-like entanglement. When it is important that memory remains unchanged,
PS might in fact be not favorable and it is known that PS deprivation can help of keeping memory
intact [J55] .
There is a lot of evidence that memory processing indeed occurs during sleep (memory consolida-
tion): in particular during paradoxical sleep (PS, REM periods with dreams) and during periods of
deep slow wave sleep (SWS) preceding them. The sequential model for memories [J55] assumes that
both periods are necessary. The ﬁrst guess is that dreams and preceding SWS periods could build
copies of both episodal and declarative memories.
The sensory experience associated with a dream possibly resulting partially by sharing of sensory
mental image of geometric past (say previous day) could give rise to a symbolic representation realized
as a kind of record. If also a copy of sensory mental image is created, the dream would involve virtual
visual input generated by sending signals from brain to retina and other sensory organs involved (in
TGD sensory organs carry fundamental sensory qualia). This back projection is present also during
wake-up state and essential part of building sensory representation from the raw sensory data. The
fact that dreams are by no means direct copies of the sensory inputs of the geometric past suggests
that an active buildup of sensory mental images indeed takes place. One could however stretch the
limits of imagination and argue that the dreams could be composed of sequences of shared mental
images from diﬀerent times: this would conform with the short time range of ”dream logic”.
If the brain can be regarded as a kind of magnetic tape in the temporal direction, SWS period
might be interpreted as a kind of empty interval in the tape telling that a memory record comes next
(kind of silence before concert). Second function of SWS pattern would be to divide the time axis
to frames analogous to letters appearing as units in computer memory. The SWS interval might also
contain a temporal pattern deﬁning among other things what might be regarded as a name of the
record in question. The temporal pattern of the negative energy signal used in memory recall should
have such a pattern that it would ”resonate” with this pattern. Note that vacuum extremal MEs
could deﬁne ”static” links to memory mental images activated during memory recall to non-vacuum
extremals and one can imagine also sequences of these extremals building a sequence of links.
Directory system, holograms, and p-adic fractality
Directory system is necessary in order to handle computer memory eﬀectively. Basically the directory
would be a scaled down fractal variant of the geometric past with a reduction of details leaving
only titles of sections and subsections, so to say. These directories would make possible an eﬀective
scanning of the brain of the geometric past by going directly to the correct directory coded roughly
by the temporal distance. The fact that we can construct mentally fractally scaled down memory
representations about what happened during day and even during lifetime without eﬀort suggests
that this kind of fractal representation indeed is there.
The obvious idea is that the items of directories serve as links to subdirectories so that it is possible
to active link in each directory item leading to a subdirectory associated with that item.
The fact that p-adically small is large in the real sense would automatically realize small time scale
representations of long temporal intervals. This would suggest that the memory storage mechanism is
hologram like so that copies of memories in various time scales are present. Eﬀective p-adic topology
would indeed suggest the presence of this kind of representation with various copies appearing as p-
adically scaled variants of basic pattern for given p. For this option declarative memory recall would
not require a precisely targeted signal to a particular moment of geometric past whereas sensory
memories would require it (note however the possibility that dreams build more or less faithful copies
of sensory memories).
One could imagine a fractal coding of names of directories and subdirectories by temporal distances
in various p-adic length scales. Here eﬀective p-adic topology giving rise to a hierarchy of p-adic length
scales might play key role in the coding. Also dark matter hierarchy and hierarchy of Planck constants
would be involved in an essential manner and code for various scales of long term memory. The fact
that favored value of Planck constants and p-adic length scales come in octaves suggests a close

7.5. A proposal for memory code
387
interaction between the two hierarchies.
The p-adic view about cognition suggests that p-adic numbers give a representation for the ad-
dresses of records and that eﬀective p-adic topology for real space-time sheets is essential.
Their
space-time counterparts would be discrete intersections ﬁeld bodies and p-adic space-time sheets hav-
ing literally inﬁnite size. The density of points of intersection would reduce as one moves away from
biological body both in temporal and spatial direction and the fact that p-adic numbers correspond
always to non-negative real numbers would conform with the fact that memories are about geometric
past and the memories of nearest past are the most precise and for time scales which are fractions of
second become sensory experiences which are actually very short term memories as ﬁndings of Libet
demonstrate.
What is the role of generalized EEG rhythms from the point of view of memory?
TGD predicts entire hierarchy of EEG rhythms which are predicted to correlate with various biorhythms.
One challenge is to understand the precise role of EEG rhythms, in particular theta band known to
be involved with memory consolidation. Functional magnetic resonance imaging led to the discovery
of so called so called spontaneous ﬂuctuations in BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal having
1/f spectrum in average sense [J65] (I am grateful for Vesa Kiviniemi (who is also working in this
ﬁeld [J61] ) for sending me this review article). The frequency spectrum of these ﬂuctuations is in the
range range .1 −.001 Hz.
This activity is regarded as spontaneous in the sense that it is not induced by stimulus, motor
output, or task but is something independent and thus conﬂicts with the paradigm that EEG corre-
sponds directly to the brain state dictated by the input to brain and motor output and by cognitive
tasks. For this reason spontaneous BOLD ﬂuctuations were originally interpreted as noise but it has
become clear that the ﬂuctuation patterns possess both spatial and temporal coherence and that it is
possible to assign regions of spatial coherence with brain functions in various brain areas.
The variation of spontaneous BOLD ﬂuctuations explains also the variation of responses in ex-
perimental situations involving ﬁxed stimulus or tasks.
Spontaneous BOLD ﬂuctuations seem to
superpose linearly with the eﬀect due to stimulus or task. BOLD ﬂuctuations seem correlate with the
slow ﬂuctuations in EEG known to modulate the power spectrum in various EEG bands. Interestingly,
there are also ∼1 Hz slow ﬂuctuations of membrane potential, which could be related to the cyclotron
frequencies of DNA nucleotides (carrying constant negative charge density).
These ﬁndings conform with the fact that TGD predicts a fractal hierarchy of EEGs corresponding
to the hierarchy of values of Planck constant. A further prediction would be that scaled variants of
alpha band and its harmonic should appear in BOLD ﬂuctuations as also the counterparts of beta
and theta bands whose positions cannot however predicted without further assumptions.
EEG and its generalization would allow to interpret EEG rhythms as dividing the magnetic tape
in time direction to a linear lattice of separate frames which each could represent a record in turn
containing further records.
This would be much like a fractal variant for the decomposition of a
written text to letters with an approximately constant width. SWS would deﬁne kind of empty lines
between paragraphs in this text and during wake-up state similar empty lines might be present.
Of course, the strict linear lattice is an idealization. It could be perturbed by insertions just like
written text by pictures. These insertions could represent sensory mental images due to sensory input.
Another analogy for sensory input would be as external force inducing kicks to the harmonic oscillator
changing the amplitude of oscillation and inducing phase increments.
7.5
A proposal for memory code
In an article in the March 8 issue of the journal PLoS Computational Biology, physicists Travis
Craddock and Jack Tuszynski of the University of Alberta, and anesthesiologist Stuart Hameroﬀof
the University of Arizona propose a mechanism for encoding synaptic memory in microtubules, major
components of the structural cytoskeleton within neurons. The self-explanatory title of the article is
Cytoskeletal Signaling: Is Memory Encoded in Microtubule Lattices by CaMKII Phosphorylation?
[J26].

388
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
7.5.1
Basic ideas of the model of memorycode
The hexagonal cylindrical lattice of microtubule suggests the possibility of lattice consisting of bits
and probably very many proposals have been made. One such idea is that bit is represented in terms
of the two basic conformations of tubulin molecules called α and β. The recent proposal is that bit
corresponds to the phosphorylation state of tubulin. Also a proposal that the bits form 6-bit bytes is
considered: 64 diﬀerent bytes are possible which would suggest a connection with the genetic code.
The motivation for the identiﬁcation of byte is that CaMKII enzyme has in the active state insect
like structure: 6 + 6 legs and the legs are either phosphorylated or not. This geometry is indeed
very suggestive of connexion with 6 inputs and 6 outputs representing genetic codons representable as
sequences of 6 bits. The geometry and electrostatics of CaMKII is complementary to the microtubular
hexagonal lattice so that CaMKII could take care of the phosphorylation of microtubulins: 6 tubulins
at most would be phosphorylated at one side. The presence of Ca+2 or calmodulin ﬂux ﬂowing to
the neuron interior during nerve pulse is responsible for self-phosphorylation of CaMKII: one can say
that CaMKII takes itself care that it remains permanently phosphorylated. I am not sure whether
this stable phosphorylation means complete phosphorylation.
It is however diﬃcult to imagine how Ca+2 and calmodulin ﬂux could contain the information
about the bit sequence and how this information could be coded in standard manner to phosphory-
lation pattern of legs. The only possibility which looks natural is that phosphorylation is a random
process and only the fraction of phosphorylated legs depends on Ca+2 and calmodulin ﬂuxes. Another
possibility would be that the subsequence process of phosphorylation MT by completely phosphory-
lated CaMKII manages to do it selectively but it is very diﬃcult to imagine how the information
about codon could be transferred to the phosphorylation state of MT.
For these reasons my cautious conclusion is that phosphorylation/its absence cannot represent bit.
What has been however found is a mechanism of phosphorylation of MTs, and the question is what
could be the function of this phosphorylation. Could this phosphorylation be related to memory but
in diﬀerent manner? The 6+6 structure of CaMKII certainly suggests that the analog of genetic code
based on 6 bits might be present but realized in some other manner.
What does one mean with memory?
Before proceeding one must make clear what one means with memory in the recent context. The
articles of New Scientists with - almost as a rule - sensationalistic titles, do not pay too much attention
for the fact this kind of proposals are always based on some philosophical assumptions which might
be wrong.
1. What one means with ”memory” in the recent context? The memory in question is behavioral
memory. Conditioning producing reﬂect like reaction is a typical example of behavioral memory
and need not have anything to do with conscious memory such as episodal memory in which
one literally re-lives an event of past. Electric stimulation of some regions of temporal lobes can
indeed induce this kind of memories. The idea about coding would suggest the identiﬁcation of
this memory with a highly symbolic computer memory based on ”carving in stone”.
2. The proposal is inspired by the idea of brain or cell as computer and can be criticized. There is no
pressing need for coding since behavioral memory can be reduced to the formation of associations
and associative learning by computers is standard example of this kind of behavioral memory.
One can of course consider the coding for declarative and verbal memories and genetic code
provides an attractive candidate for a universal code. This kind of code might be behind the
natural languages as a kind of molecular language.
3. Behavioral memories can be deﬁned as changes of behavior resulting from a continued stimulus.
The understanding of behavioral memory relies on the notions of synaptic strength, synaptic
plasticity, and long term potentiation. Synaptic strength tells how strongly the postsynaptic
neuron responds to the nerve pulse pattern arriving along pre-synaptic axon and mediated by
neurotransmitter over the synaptic gap. For instance, glutamate acts as excitatory neurotrans-
mitter and binding to receptor. At neuronal levels long term potentiation means increase of
the synaptic strength so that post-synaptic neuron becomes ”more attentive” to the ﬁring of
pre-synaptic neuron.

7.5. A proposal for memory code
389
Hebb’s rules [J10]- not established laws of Nature and plagued by exceptions - state that the
eﬀectiveness of synaptic receptors increases, when the two neurons ﬁre simultaneously: it is
important to notice that these ﬁrings need not have any causal connection with each other. The
simultaneous ﬁring activates NMDA receptors in the post-synaptic neuron and generates Ca+2
ﬂux which correlates with the increase of the synaptic strength. NMDA obeys same chemical
formula C5H9NO4 as glutamate: in fact, glutamate and asparagin the two acidic amino-acids. It
is also known that the presence of CaKMII is necessary for the increase of the synaptic strengths.
4. There is however an almost-paradox involved with this view about memory if assumed to explain
all kinds of memories - in particular episodal memories. Long term conscious memories can
be lifelong. Synaptic structures are however highly unstable since the synapses and proteins
involved are cycled.
To my view this argument is somewhat naive.
There could be a ﬂow
equilibrium. The ﬂow pattern of ﬂuid ﬂow in ﬂow equilibrium can be stable although the ﬂuid is
replaced with new one all the time. The proposal of authors is that memories are stored to some
more stable structures and that microtubules are these more stable structures making possible
short term memories. Post-synaptic microtubules, which diﬀer from presynaptic microtubules
in several manners are indeed stabilized by MAPs. Authors also propose the thin ﬁlaments
associated with the cytoskeleton are responsible for long term memories.
Authors believe on computationalism and they apply standard view about time so that their
conclusion is that long term memories are stored elsewhere and remain able to regulate synaptic
plasticity. In this framework the notion of memory code is very natural.
LTP and synaptic plasticity
From Wikipedia one can read that synaptic plasticity [J21] means possibility for changes in function,
location and/or number of post-synaptic receptors and ion channels. Synapses are indeed very dy-
namical and synaptic receptors and channel proteins are transient, which does not seem to conform
with the standard view about long term memory and indeed suggest that the stable structures are
elsewhere.
Long term potentiation [J13], brieﬂy LTP, involves gene expression, protein synthesis and recruit-
ment of new receptors or even synapses. The mechanism of LTP is believed to be following. The
glutamate from pre-synaptic neuron binds to post-synaptic receptors, which leads to the opening of
Ca+2 channels and inﬂux of Ca+2 ions to dendritic spines, shafts and neuronal cell body. The inﬂow
of Ca+2 induces activation of multiple enzyme including protein kinase A and C and CaMKII. These
enzymes phosphorylate intra-neuronal molecules.
It is known that the presence of CaMKII is necessary for long term potentiation. This supports
the proposal of authors that microtubules are involved in an essential manner in memory storage and
processing and regulation of synaptic plasticity. The observation about the correspondence between
the geometries of CaMKII and microtubular surface is rather impressive support for the role of MTs.
To my opinion, the hypothesis about memory code is however un-necessary.
Microtubules
Quite generally, microtubules (MTs) are basic structural elements of cytoskeleton. They are rope like
polymers and grow as long as 25 micrometers long. They are highly dynamical. The standard view
identiﬁes their basic function as maintaining of cell structures, providing platforms for intracellular
transport, forming the spindle during mitosis, etc..
Microtubules [J14] are extremely rich in eukaryotic biology and brain neurons. They are believed
to connect membrane and cytoskeletal levels of information processing together. MTs are the basic
structural elements of axons and MTs in axons and dendrites/neuronal cell bodies are diﬀerent. Den-
drites contain antiparallel arrays MTs interrupted and stabilized by microtubule associated proteins
(MAPs) including MAP2. This diﬀerence between dendritic and axonal microtubules could be rele-
vant for the understanding of the neuronal information processing. Microtubules are associated also
with long neural pathways from sensory receptors, which seem to maximize their length.
For these reasons it would not be surprising if MTs would play a key role in the information
processing at neuronal level. Indeed, the more modern view tends to see microtubules as the nervous

390
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
system of the cell, and the hexagonal lattice like structure of microtubuless trongly suggests informa-
tion processing as a basic function of microtubules. Many information processing related functions
have been proposed for microtubules. Microtubules have been suggested role as cellular automatons
and also quantum coherence in microtubular scale has been proposed.
The proposal of the article is that short term memory is realized in terms of a memory code at
the level of MTs and that intermediate ﬁlaments which are much more stable could be responsible for
long term memory.
CaMKII enzyme
According to the proposal the key enzyme of memory would be Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II: brieﬂy CaMKII [J8]. Its presence is known to be necessary for long term potentiation.
In passive state CaMKII has snowﬂake shape. The activated kinase looks like double sided insect
with six legged kinase domains on both sides of a central domain. Activation means phosphorylation
of the 6+6 legs of this ”nano-insect”. In the presence of Ca+2 or calmodulin ﬂux CaKMII self-actives
meaning self-phosphorylation so that it remains permanently active.
There are however grave objections against phosphate=1–no-phosphate=0 coding.
1. Only the ﬂuxes of Ca+2 and/or calmodulin matter so that it is very diﬃcult to imagine any
coding.
One would expect that the fraction of phosphorylated legs depends on these ﬂuxes
in equilibrium but it is very diﬃcult to image how these ﬂuxes could carry information about
a speciﬁc pattern of phosphorylation for legs.
If all legs are phosphorylated the coding to
microtubular phosphorylation would require that 6 bits of information is fed at this stage by
telling which leg actually gives its phosphate to tubulin. This does not look two plausible but
one must be very cautious in making too strong conclusions.
2. Since metabolic energy is necessary for any information processing, the more plausible inter-
pretation would be that phosphorylation makes bit active. Bit itself would be represented in
some other manner. The 6+6 leg structure of CaMKII is very suggestive of a connexion with 6
incoming bits and 6 outgoing bits - possible same or conjugated. The interpretation in terms of
DNA codon and its conjugate is what comes ﬁrst in mind.
One should not however throw away child with the wash water. The highly interesting discovery
discussed in the article [J26] is that the spatial dimensions, geometric shape, and electrostatic binding
of the insect-like CamKII and hexagonal lattices of tubulin proteins in microtubules ﬁt nicely together.
The authors show how CaMKII kinase domains can collectively bind and phosphorylate MTs. This
alone could be an extremely important piece of information. There is no need to identify bit with
phosphorylation state.
7.5.2
TGD view about the situation
TGD based view about memory could have been developed by starting from the paradox related to
long term memories. Memories are long lasting but the structures supposed to be responsible for their
storage are short-lived. TGD based solution of the paradox would be based on new view about the
relationship between geometric time and experienced time.
1. According to this view brain is 4-dimensional and primary memories are in the time-place,
where the neural event took place for the ﬁrst time. In principle there would be no need to
store memories by ”carving them in stone”. To remember would be to see in time direction:
this view is indeed possible in zero energy ontology. Time-like entanglement and signaling to
the geometric past using negative energy signals would be the basic mechanisms of memory.
2. Stable memories require copies also for another reason. The negative energy signal to geometric
past is not expected to allow a precise targeting to a one particular moment of time in past.
To circumvent the problem one must make the target large enough in time direction.
The
strengthening of memory would mean building up large number of copies of memory. These
copies are produced in every conscious memory recall and learning would be based on this
mechanism. The neuronal mechanism would produce large number of copies of the memory
and one can ask whether CaMKII indeed generates phosphorylated sections of MT somehow

7.5. A proposal for memory code
391
essential for the representation of long term symbolic memories as names for experiences rather
than experiences themselves.
3. Metabolism must relate also to conscious memory recall. Since negative energy signals are in-
volved, there is great temptation to assume that de-phosphorylation liberating metabolic energy
corresponding to the absorbed negative energy accompanies memory recall. Large ℏfor the
photons involved would allow very low frequencies -expected to characterize the time span of
memory recall - and make communications over very long time intervals possible. This would
mean that the original memory representation is destroyed in the memory recall. This would
conform with the spirit of quantum no-cloning theorem [B4]. Several copies of the memory rep-
resentation would be needed and also feed of metabolic energy to generate new copies. In this
framework conscious memory recall would be dynamical event rather than stable bit sequence
in accordance with the vision about quantum jump as moment of consciousness.
Braiding as a universal model for memory
This leaves a lot of freedom to construct more detailed models of symbolic memories.
1. Braiding of magnetic ﬂux tubes would make possible not only topological quantum computation
[K23] but also a universal mechanism of long term memory. In the model of DNA as topological
quantum computer the ﬂux tubes connect DNA nucleotides and lipids of cell membrane. It
turned out that the ﬂux tubes carrying dark matter - identiﬁed as ordinary particles but with
non-standard value of Planck constant [K24] - could connect all kinds of biomolecules and
that braiding and reconnection could serve as basic quantum mechanisms in the functioning of
biomolecules. Flux tubes could also connect the tubulins of microtubules and lipids of axonal
or dendritic membrane.
2. Two kinds of braidings are present: the lipid ﬂow deﬁnes braiding in time direction as the
analog of dance and the fact that lipids are like dancers with threads from shoes the wall - now
microtubule surface - so that the dance induce braiding of these threads storing the dynamics of
the dance to memory. The presence of both space-like and time-like braiding and the fact that
they are in well-deﬁned sense dual has become central idea of quantum TGD itself. Originally
it was however discovered in the model for DNA as topological quantum computer [K23].
3. Both active memory recall by sending negative energy dark photon to geometric past and
spontaneous memory recall by receiving a positive energy photons from geometric past require
metabolic energy. Therefore the presence of phosphate in braid strands is necessary. The ﬂux
tubes deﬁning braid strands can be therefore assumed to be active only if they have phosphate
at the other end. A more appropriate TGD based interpretation is that this makes possible
negentropic entanglement, which is one of the basic predictions of the number theoretic vision
about life. High energy phosphate bond would thus a signature of negentropic entanglement,
which could serve as a correlate for the experience of understanding. One could relate ATP-ADP
process as a basic process of life directly to cognition. The presence of phosphate would tell that
there is magnetic ﬂux tube - actually pair of them- beginning from the molecule.
TGD variant of the microtubular model for memory
The ﬁnding of the authors inspires a more detailed formulation for the vision for how memories could
be realized at microtubular level.
1. The phosphorylation of tubulins would generate active braids strands and their presence would
make possible memory recall. Note that memories as such could be stored to the braiding in
any case if the microtubule-lipid ﬂux tubes are present always. Every nerve pulse pattern would
induce a ﬂow of lipids at neuronal membrane if the membrane is in a phase corresponding to
2-D liquid crystal. This ﬂow pattern would be stored to the braiding of the ﬂux tubes.
2. In the model of DNA as topological quantum computer one assigns to braid strands connecting
DNA nucleotides to lipids 4 diﬀerent states representing the nucleotides A,T,C, G. In the original
model the A,T,C,G were mapped to four states deﬁned by quarks u,d and their antiquarks at

392
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
the ends of braid strands. This proposal can be of course accused of being quite too science
ﬁctive. TGD however predicts the possibility of scaled up variants of QCD type physics even in
the scale of living matter and there are some indications for this.
A more down-to-earth realization of the genetic code proposed quite recently [K35] is that
braid states correspond to pairs of magnetic ﬂux tubes. To the ends of both ﬂux tubes one
assigns electron so that the electrons form spin triplet and spin singlet state deﬁning 3+1 states
representing A,T,C,G. This gives also a connection with electronic super-conductivity which
is fundamental assumption in the model of nerve pulse based on Josephson currents: nerve
pulse corresponds to a simple perturbation of the ground state in which all Josephson current
along axon are oscillating in the same phase. Mathematically the phase diﬀerence behaves like
gravitational pendulum [K62].
The 6=2+2+2 legs could correspond to ﬂux tube pairs and each ﬂux tube pair would represent
DNA nucleotide in terms of the spin state of electron pair. Phosphorylation would activate the
braid strand by making possible negentropic entanglement and information storage and recall.
This conforms with the fact of life is that metabolic energy is needed for all kinds of information
processing including also information storage.
If all 6 tubulins to which bits are assigned are indeed phosphorylated in the active state and if
the memory recall involves use of metabolic energy as proposed, then the reading of the memory
would mean complete de-phosphorylation of 6-tubulin sequences. The prediction would be the
presence of phosphorylated 6-tubulin sequences at microtubular surface and their disappearance
in memory recall. I do not know whether there is any manner to test these predictions.
3. For this proposal LTP would involve a generation of active braid strands. The post-synaptic
neuron would be in ”wake-up” state and would pay attention to the nerve pulse patterns arriving
from the pre-synaptic neuron. This activation would be induced by simultaneous ﬁring of post-
synaptic and pre-synaptic neurons. As a consequence, the lipid ﬂow would generate braidings
providing memory representations and deﬁning in temporal domain quantum computation like
processes.
4. This does not yet explain why CaMKII is necessary for LTP. There is a high temptation to
regard the increase of the synaptic sensitivity as a property of synaptic connection. One can
imagine several mechanisms.
(a) For instance, active ﬂux tube connections between presynaptic lipids and postsynaptic mi-
crotubuli could be generated by phosphorylation, and the ﬂux tubes might increase the ﬂow
of glutamate between pre- and post-synaptic neurons and in this manner increase synap-
tic strength. Flux tubes might make possible a continual ﬂow of dark particles between
pre- and post-synaptic neurons. They could also make possible negentropic entanglement
between the two neutrons binding the neurons to single coherent quantum whole.
(b) The strength of this connection could be aﬀected also by the presence of active braid
strands making possible quantum memory and topological quantum computation. Also
more complex processes assigned with LTP would become possible since microtubules might
be seen as conscious intelligent structures able to modify their nearby environment.
7.6
Updates since 2012
A considerable progress has occurred in the understanding of TGD inspired theory of consciousness
during the ﬁrst half of 2013. I have not however included all material about this progress since other
chapters of ”TGD Inspired theory of consciousness” already contain the relevant material. A detailed
representation of the recent vision about TGD inspired theory of consciousness [K97] is recommended
for the reader interested in details and various philosophical problems and their solutions in TGD
framework.
The intuitive idea is that memories should be approximate invariants under quantum jump se-
quence. NMP [K44] indeed implies that negentropic entanglement is approximately invariant under
quantum jumps. This inspires the idea that various representations (sensory - , memory - , cognitive

7.6. Updates since 2012
393
- ) correspond to negentropically entangled systems. Interaction free quantum measurement allows
non-destructive conscious reading of these representations in arbitrarily good approximation.
Also the updated view about the realisation of representations is discussed at the end of the
chapter ”Quantum Model of Memory” [K66]. The basic assumption is that K¨ahler magnetic ﬂux tubes
carrying monopole ﬂux and topological light rays (”massless externals” (MEs)) parallel to them serve
as geometric correlates of quantum coherence and their braiding serves as correlate for negentropic
entanglement. This leads to a rather concrete picture about how various representations are realised
at the level of the magnetic body of the organism.
The conscious reading of the memory and other representations by interaction free scattering
of dark photons together with the assumption that biophotons result as dark photons transform to
biophotons in energy conserving manner leads to a direct contact with the experimental reality. The
encouraging ﬁnding made during the last years is that biophotons and EEG correlate with each other:
the reader interested in a detailed model can consult ”Are dark photons behind biophotons” [K95]
and ”Comments on the recent experiments by the group of Michael Persinger” [K96].
7.6.1
How memories are represented and recalled?
Formation of memories and memory recall are key elements in the vision proposed by Hawkins. The
question is what memories and memory recall are. If quantum jump is the fundamental process, it
should automatically give rise to memories and memory recall.
1. Memories in given scale would naturally correspond to sequences of mental images deﬁned
by negentropically entangled sub-CDs of CD in given scale.
According to earlier view the
sequences of moments of consciousness bind to form higher level moments of consciousness,
selves.
Somewhat diﬀerent view is that formation of selves means formation of sequence of
negentropically entangled sub-CDs stable against NMP and preserved in quantum jump and
even increasing in size. Thus self would correspond to a property of state and consciousness
would be associated with the replacement of state with a new one.
2. The hierarchical structure of memories would emerge naturally. Conscious memory recall would
correspond to a generation of negentropic entanglement between the new mental images emerg-
ing in the state function reduction (recall that the sizes of CDs increase and new sub-CDs
emerge) and already existing negentropically entangled mental images. Generation of negen-
tropic entanglement would give rise to the experience of recognition of the new mental images.
3. The natural guess is that negentropic entanglement is generated if the new sensory input is
”consistent” with older mental images. The addition of new tensor factor would mean a more
abstract representation so that the sequence of quantum jumps would mean accumulation of
experience. Consistency with older mental images could mean that the mental images have same
”name”. The name could correspond to p-adic cognitive representation. The physical correlate
could be a collection of resonance frequencies. The names would be same if the frequencies for
older mental images and new one are same, so that resonant interactions becomes possible. The
generation of negentropic entanglement would be like ﬁnding a radio station.
For this proposal memory recall and memory formation are actually more or less the same thing.
Only the completely new memories claimed to be formed in hippocampus would not involve memory
recall. The new memory would correspond to a new sub-CD or ensemble of sub-CDs representing
the associated negentropically entangled mental images. Neuronal loop could make possible to build
copies about the new memory and thinking about it would create copies of corresponding p-adic cog-
nitive representations which in turn could be transformed via state function reduction to an opposite
boundary of CD to actions. In TGD framework the 4-D hierarchy of memories could continue from
hippocampus to the magnetic body: this would explain the correlation of EEG with memory and also
with various other brain functions.
7.6.2
Could interaction free measurement be used to deduce information
about self model?
The assumption that self model is a negentropically entangled system which does not change in
state function reduction, leads to a problem. If the conscious information about this kind of subself

394
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
corresponds to change of negentropy in quantum jump, it seems impossible to get this information.
Quite generally, if moment of consciousness corresponds to quantum jump and thus change, how it
is possible to carry conscious information about quantum state?
The following proposal for non-
destructive reading of memories and future plans allows to resolve this problem.
Bomb testing problem as a model for interaction free measurement
One can consider a generalization of so called interaction free measurement as a manner to deduced
information about self model. This information would be obtained as sequences of bits and might be
correspond to declarative, verbal memories rather than direct sensory experiences.
1. The bomb testing problem of Elitzur and Vaidman gives a nice concrete description of what hap-
pens in interaction free measurement, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElitzurVaidman_
bomb-testing_problem [B1] for an illustration of the system considered.
The challenge is to ﬁnd whether the bomb is dud or not. Bomb explodes if it receives photon
with given energy. The simplest test would explode all bombs. Interaction free measurement
allows to make test by destroying only small number of bombs and at idealized limit no bombs
are destroyed.
The system involves four lenses arranged in square and two detectors C and D at the upper
right corner of the square. In the ﬁrst lense at the lower left corner the incoming photon beam
splits to reﬂected and transmitted beams: the path travelled by transmitted beam contains the
bomb.
(a) The bomb absorbs photon with a probability which tells the fraction of photon beam going
to the path at which bomb is (is transmitted through the lense). The other possibility is
that this measurement process creates a state in which photon travels along the other path
(is reﬂected). This photon goes through a lense and ends up to detector C or D through
lense.
(b) If the bomb is dud, the photon travels through both paths and interference at the lense
leads the photon to detector D. If C detects photon we know that the bomb was not a dud
without exploding it. If D detects the photon, it was either dud or not and we can repeat
the experiment as long as bomb explodes, or C detects photon and stop if the detector
continues to be D (dud). This arrangement can be reﬁned so that at the ideal limit no
explosions take place and all.
2. The measurement of bomb property is interaction free experiment in the sense that state function
reduction performed by absorber/bomb can eliminate the interaction in the sense that photon
travels along the path not containing the bomb. One might say that state function reduction
is an interaction which can eliminates the usual interaction with photon beam. State function
reduction performed by bomb can change the history of photon so it travels along the path not
containing the bomb.
This picture is only metaphorical representation of something much more general.
1. Bomb could be of course replaced with any two-state system absorbing photons in one state but
not in the other state, say atom. Now one would test in which state the atom is gaining one
bit of information in the optimal situation. Two-state atom could thus represent bit and one
could in principle read the bit sequence formed by atoms (say in row) by this method without
any photon absorption so that the row of atoms would remain in the original state.
2. Two-state system could be replaced with N-state system. In this case the testing selects at ﬁrst
step one state as analogs of bomb intact and the remaining states as analogs of dud. If the
answer was ”dud” in the ﬁrst step, the next step selects one preferred state from N −1 states
and regards the remaining states as ”dud”. The process continues until the state of the system
is measured.
3. In TGD framework the photon paths branching at lenses correspond to branching 3-surfaces
analogous to branching strings in string model and photon wave splits to sum of waves travelling
along the two paths.

Memory recall as an interaction free measurement
One can imagine several applications if the information to be read in interaction free manner can be
interpreted as bit sequences represented as states of two-state system. Lasers in ground states and its
excited state would be analogous many particle quantum system. In TGD framework the analog of
laser consisting of two space-time sheets with diﬀerent sizes and diﬀerent zero point kinetic energies
would be the analogous system.
For instance, a model of memory recall with memories realized as negentropically entangled states
such that each state represents a qubit can be considered. The model applies also to the reading of
future plans (memories on reversed time direction).
1. Reading of a particular qubit of memory means sending of negative energy photon signal to the
past, which can be absorbed in the reading process. The problem is however that the memory
representation is changed in this process since two state system returns to the ground state. This
could be seen as analog of no-cloning theorem (the read thoughts deﬁne the clone). Interaction
free measurement could help to overcome the problem partially. Memory would not be aﬀected
at all at the limit so that no-cloning theorem would be circumvented at this limit.
2. A possible problem is that the analogs of detectors C and D for a given qubit are in geometric
past and one must be able to decide whether it was C or D that absorbed the negative energy
photon! Direct conscious experience should tell whether the detector C or D ﬁred: could this
experience correspond to visual quale black/white and more generally to a pair of complementary
colors?
3. ZEO means that zero energy states appear have both imbedding space arrows of time and these
arrows appear alternately. This dichotomy would correspond to sensory representation-motor
action dichotomy and would suggest that there is no fundamental diﬀerence between memory
recall and future prediction by self model and they diﬀerent only the direction of the signal.
4. Since photon absorption is the basic process, the conscious experience about the qubit pattern
could be visual sensation or even some other kind of sensory qualia induced by the absoroption
of photons. The model for the lipids of cell membrane as pixels of a sensory screen suggests that
neuronal/cell membranes could serve deﬁned digital self model at the length scale of neurons.
Some comments are in order.
1. To avoid misunderstandings it should be emphasized that TGD based view about memory is
not the same as the standard view. In ZEO brain is four-dimensional and in principle memories
can be negentropically entanglement memories in geometric past. It is possible to build copies
of memories by memory recall, and learning would correspond to a generation of large enough
number of copies of the memory mental image.
Memory recall could be seen as a negative
energy signal inducing the interaction free measurement of memory qubits. Dark photons with
EEG frequencies (say in theta band characterizing hippocompus) but having energies of visible
photons could be involved with the memory recall. Correlation between EEG and biophotons
supports this view.
2. If the systems taking the role of the detectors C and D in interaction free measurement are
analogous to population reversed lasers, their return to the ground state could automatically
generate virtual sensory input propagating to the sensory organs and allowing to check whether
it is consistent with the actual sensory input. The generation of the feeback signal takes some
time expected however to be much shorter than that for a typical neuronal activity.
Since the signals would propagate with light velocity, the virtual sensory input could travel
practically instantaneously from the brain to sensory organs and possibly also vice versa. Libet’s
experiments on passive aspects of consciousness [J56] in fact demonstrate a time delay which
is fraction of second having interpretation in terms of time to propagate to a layer of magnetic
body of size scale of Earth and back: these delays are consistent with the fact that the chronon
of sensory experience is about .1 seconds. The propagation of photon signals in both directions
would make possible construction of sensory representation in time scale much shorter than that
of neural activity. This mechanism could also explain generation of after images.

396
Chapter 7. Quantum Model of Memory
3. Photons can be replaced with phonons or quanta of any other wave motion with constant
propagation velocity (no dispersion of signal) in a given reference frame. This suggests that
imagination and internal speech correspond to the two reading mechanisms of memories.
Some critical questions
There are two basic objections against quantum theories of consciousness. How it is possible to have
conscious information about invariant under quantum jumps if only change is experienced continu-
ously? The outcome of state function reduction in standard quantum theory is random: how can
one understand freedom of choice and intentional behaviour in terms of state function reduction?
NMP and the possibility of negentropic entanglement imply that TGD based quantum theory is not
equivalent with the standard one, and this allows to circumvent the objections.
There are however two further questions, which I cannot answer yet. Can one really assume that
the notion of interaction free measurement continues to make sense in TGD framework? Could NMP
allow to make this notion exact or make it impossible? Could the invariants or at least their existence
be experienced directly without interaction free measurement?
The experiments carried out to test whether 40 Hz thalamocortical resonance is correlate for
conscious experience suggests that the resonance is present only when a new pattern is discovered,
not when it has become a memory. The TGD inspired interpretation would be that the resonances
accompanies negentropy gain and quantum jump is necessary for conscious experience. However, the
reports about higher states of consciousness (and also my own experiences) suggest that the invariants
can be experienced directly when all thoughts (interaction free measurements) are eliminated. This
experience cannot be however communicated: one understands does not know what one understands.
Therefore also the original vision that negentropic entanglement corresponds to conscious experience
- experience of pure understanding, which is not communicable - and in apparent contradiction with
the basic hypothesis about quantum jump, would be correct after all!
7.6.3
Realization of memory representations in terms of braided ﬂux tubes
While reading a marvellous book ”The Field” by Lynn McTaggart [I28] about evolution of ideas about
the role of electromagnetic ﬁelds in biology and neuroscience, I became aware of two questions which
I had not yet answered. The ﬁrst question is following: How various representations (sensory - ,
memory -,...) - ”Akashic records” - are realized as negentropically entangled states?
Magnetic body should be the seat of memories in some sense.
1. I have already earlier proposed this kind of realization based on the observation that braiding
in time direction generates space-like braiding [K23]. Dancers on the parquette with their feet
connected to the wall by threads illustrates the idea. When dancers move at the parquette their
world lines deﬁne a time-like braiding in 3-dimensional space-time assignable to the ﬂoor. Also
the threads connecting the dancers to the wall get braided - or entangled - as one might also say.
There is clearly a duality between time-like and space-like braidings: the running topological
quantum computer program coded by braiding in time direction is stored as space-like braiding
deﬁning memory representation of what happened. Note that same mechanism realizes also
predictions and future plans as time reversed topological quantum computer programs in ZEO.
CDs in various scales contain this kind of programs and their memory representations.
2. I have also proposed that the geometric entanglement - braiding - of ﬂux tubes deﬁnes a space-
time correlate for quantum entanglement. In the case of topological quantum computation it
would be naturally described by probabilities, which are rational numbers (or perhaps even
algebraic numbers in some algebraic extension of p-adic numbers characterizing together value
of the p-adic prime the evolutionary level of the system). Hence the notion of number theoretic
negentropy makes sense and one obtains a connection with topological quantum computation.
3. The representation of memories in terms of space-like braiding of magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting
various systems would be universal, and not restricted to DNA-cell membrane system in which
the ﬂux tubes would connect DNA nucleotides [K23, K85] or codons (this seems to be the more
plausible option [K96]) with the lipids. One could indeed speak about Akashic records (see
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records).

7.6. Updates since 2012
397
4. The time reversals or these representations deﬁned by the zero energy states of opposite arrow of
the imbedding space time would deﬁne a representation for future predictions/ plans in ZEO. For
instance, the development of a seed to a full-grown organism could be coded in this manner in
time scale where CD has time scale of order of the lifetime of the organism. Already Burr found
evidence that the radiation ﬁeld assignable to the seed has the same shape as the plant [I7, I28]
or animal (salamander in his experiments). This energy ﬁeld would naturally correspond to
the magnetic body containing dark photon Bose-Einstein condensates.
The Akashic records
and their time reversal would naturally correspond to the morphic ﬁelds of Sheldrake [I33, I34]:
memories and future plans in time scales longer than than duration of life cycle for an individual
member of species would be possibles. Every scientist of course agrees that the societies are
busily predicting and planning their futures but ﬁnd very diﬃcult to accept the idea that this
could have some concrete quantum physical correlate.


Chapter 8
About the Nature of Time
8.1
Introduction
The notion of time remains one of the most problematic concepts of physics. In classical physics the
diﬀerent properties of the time of Newton’s equations and thermodynamical time are puzzling. In
special relativity and general relativity the notion of simultaneity becomes a problematic concept and
challenges the naive Newtonian view about time ﬂow as a motion of 3-D time=constant snapshot of
4-D space-time. The replacement of time=constant 3-surface with past directed light-cone assignable
to the world-line of observer resolves this problem. In general relativity the problem is that past
light-cones need make sense only locally. In quantum measurement theory the localization of the
state function reduction process into a ﬁnite space-time volume is in conﬂict with the determinism of
Schr¨odinger equation. In biology the presence of self-organization processes like self assembly challenge
second law of thermodynamics in short time scales. In neuroscience the ﬁnding of Libet suggesting
that neural activity seems to precede conscious decision forces to give up the notion of free will or the
naive identiﬁcation of experienced and geometrical time.
In this chapter I will consider a new view about time based on Topological Geometrodynamics [K89]
, which can be regarded as an attempt to unify fundamental interactions assuming that space-times
are representable as 4-dimensional surfaces of certain higher-dimensional space-time H = M 4 × CP2
(M 4 denotes 4-D Minkowski space and CP2 complex projective space of 2 complex dimensions) ﬁxed
by the requirement that the theory explains standard model symmetries and provides a geometrization
of classical gauge ﬁelds and gravitational ﬁelds.
The construction of quantum TGD leads to a radical revision of space-time concept (many-sheeted
space-time and topological ﬁeld quantization), and forces also to generalize the original view about
imbedding space. p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intentionality is part of TGD inspired
theory of consciousness and the need to fuse real and p-adic physics to single coherent whole forces
to revise the notions of number and space-time. It has been also necessary to replace the standard
positive energy ontology with what I call zero energy ontology. These generalizations are of special
importance in TGD inspired theory of consciousness and of quantum biology.
There are several ﬁrst principle approaches to quantum TGD and following gives only a very
concise summary of them.
1. Generalization of Einstein’s program of geometrizing classical physics so that quantum theory
can be seen as a theory of classical spinor ﬁelds in the world of classical worlds (WCW) consisting
of light-like 3-surfaces and possessing K¨ahler geometry [K15, K13] . By general coordinate clas-
sical physics becomes an exact part of quantum theory in a well-deﬁned sense. A geometrization
of Fermi statistics is obtained, and the Cliﬀord algebra associated with the spinors of WCW can
be regarded as a direct sum of von Neumann algebras known as hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1
(HFFs) closely related to quantum groups and non-commutative geometry;
2. Quantum TGD as almost topological ﬁeld theory (TQFT) with fundamental objects identiﬁed
as light-like 3-surfaces and having generalized super-conformal symmetries as symmetries [K17,
K16] : the notion of braid is the basic building block of this approach;
399

400
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
3. There are two kinds of conformal symmetries corresponding to the boundary of light-cone of
Minkowski space and light-like 3-surfaces, and these symmetries alone dictate to high degree the
physics. Quite recently it turned that also a symplectic analog of conformal ﬁeld theory emerges
naturally in TGD framework (super-symplectic symmetries) and this led to a concrete proposal
for how to construct n-point functions needed to calculate M-matrix [K89] ;
4. Physics as a generalized number theory involving three diﬀerent threads corresponding to need
fuse real and various p-adic physics to single coherent whole by using a generalization of number
concept obtained by gluing reals and various p-adic number ﬁelds and their extensions together
along rationals and common algebraics [K79] ; the observation that standard model symmetries
and dynamics of quantum and classical TGD are to high degree dictated by classical number
ﬁelds [K80] ; and the ideas inspired by the notion of inﬁnite prime [K78] ;
5. The identiﬁcation of WCW Cliﬀord algebra elements as hyper-octonion (subspace of complexiﬁed
octonions spanned by real unit and octonionic imaginary units multiplied by the commuting
additional imaginary unit) valued conformal ﬁelds having values in HFF provides a justiﬁcation
for the concept of number theoretic braid needed both in the fusion of real and p-adic physics
and in TGD as almost TQFT approach;
6. The hierarchy of Planck constants realizing quantum criticality [K24] forces a generalization of
the notion of imbedding space by replacing it with a book like structure having as its pages
singular coverings and factor spaces of H and allowing to realize geometric correlates for the
choice of quantization axis in quantum measurement: the particles at diﬀerent pages of this
book are ”relatively dark” since they do not possess local interaction vertices which means a
radically new manner to interpret dark matter;
7. Zero energy ontology and the notion of ﬁnite measurement resolution formulated in terms of
inclusions of HFFs ﬁx quantum dynamics highly in terms of Connes tensor product allowing to
interpret quantum theory as a square root of thermodynamics [K89, K16] : ﬁnite measurement
resolution has number theoretic braid as its space-time correlate so that various approaches to
TGD are closely related;
8. Quantum theory of consciousness as a generalization of quantum measurement theory to include
observer to the theory [L8] .
The notion of number theoretic braid is a common denominator of various approaches to quantum
TGD and leads to eﬀective discretization of the imbedding space which is however due to the ﬁnite
measurement resolution and number theoretic constraints rather than being something fundamental
so that there are no problems with standard conservation laws.
The article series about TGD and its applications to biology and consciousness [K89, K83] ,
[L8, L7, L4, L6, L5, L3] gives an overall view about quantum TGD. In the following I will concentrate
only on the aspects of quantum TGD relevant for the notion of time. I will ﬁrst describe zero energy
ontology and p-adicization program and after that consider the problem of time.
The TGD based vision about how the arrow of geometric time is by no means fully developed
and ﬁnal. What seems now clear is the decisive role of ZEO and hierarchy of CDs, and the fact
that the quantum arrow of geometric time is coded into the structure of zero energy states to a high
extent. The still questionable but attractively simple hypothesis is that U matrix two basis with
opposite quantum arrows of geometric time: is this assumption really consistent with what we know
about the arrow of time? If this is the case, the question is how the relatively well-deﬁned quantum
arrow of geometric time implies the experienced arrow of geometric time. Should one assume the
arrow of geometric time separately as a basic property of the state function reduction cascade or more
economically- does it follow from the arrow of time for zero energy states?
In the following only diﬀerent views about how the arrow of time is generated, how self experiences
the quantum jumps at lower levels of self hierarchy as a continuous ﬂow of time, and how the contents
of sensory experience seem to be localized around a rather narrow interval of geometric time.

The most recent vision about zero energy ontology and
p-adicization
The generalization of the number concept obtained by fusing real and p-adics along rationals and
common algebraics is the basic philosophy behind p-adicization. One must be able to speak about
rational points common to real and various p-adic variants of H. The basic objection is the necessity
to ﬁx some special coordinates in turn implying the loss of a manifest general coordinate invariance.
The isometries of the imbedding space could save the situation provided one can identify some special
coordinate system in which isometry group reduces to its discrete subgroup.
The loss of the full
isometry group could be compensated by assuming that WCW is union over sub-WCWs obtained by
applying isometries on basic sub-WCW with discrete subgroup of isometries.
The combination of zero energy ontology realized in terms of a hierarchy of causal diamonds
(CDs) and hierarchy of Planck constants providing a description of dark matter and leading to a
generalization of the notion of imbedding space suggests that it is possible to realize this dream. The
article [K89] provides a brief summary about recent state of quantum TGD helping to understand the
big picture behind the following considerations.
8.2.1
Zero energy ontology brieﬂy
1. The basic construct in the zero energy ontology is the space CD×CP2, where the causal diamond
CD is deﬁned as an intersection of future and past directed light-cones with time-like separation
between their tips regarded as points of the underlying universal Minkowski space M 4. In zero
energy ontology physical states correspond to pairs of positive and negative energy states located
at the boundaries of the future and past directed light-cones of a particular CD.
2. CDs form a fractal hierarchy and one can glue smaller CDs within larger CDs. This construc-
tion recipe when combined with TGD inspired theory of consciousness allows to understand
the asymmetry between positive and negative energies and why the arrow of experienced time
corresponds to the arrow of geometric time and why the contents of sensory experience is located
to so narrow interval of geometric time. One can imagine evolution to occur as quantum leaps
in which the size of the largest CD in the hierarchy of personal CDs increases in such a manner
that it becomes sub-CD of a larger CD. p-Adic length scale hypothesis [K89] follows if the val-
ues of temporal distance T between tips of CD come in powers of 2n: T = 2nT0. All conserved
quantum numbers for zero energy states have vanishing net values. The interpretation of zero
energy states in the framework of positive energy ontology is as physical events, say scattering
events with positive and negative energy parts of the state interpreted as initial and ﬁnal states
of the event.
3. In the realization of the hierarchy of Planck constants CD × CP2 is replaced with a Cartesian
product of book like structures formed by almost copies of CDs and CP2s deﬁned by singular
coverings and factors spaces of CD and CP2 with singularities corresponding to intersection
M 2∩CD and homologically trivial geodesic sphere S2 of CP2 for which the induced K¨ahler form
vanishes. The coverings and factor spaces of CDs are glued together along common M 2 ∩CD.
The coverings and factors spaces of CP2 are glued together along common homologically non-
trivial geodesic sphere S2. The choice of preferred M 2 as subspace of tangent space of X4 at all
its points and interpreted as space of non-physical polarizations, brings M 2 into the theory also
in diﬀerent manner. S2 in turn deﬁnes a subspace of the much larger space of vacuum extremals
as surfaces inside M 4 × S2.
4. Conﬁguration space (the world of classical worlds, WCW) decomposes into a union of sub-
WCWs corresponding to diﬀerent choices of M 2 and S2 and also to diﬀerent choices of the
quantization axes of spin and energy, color isospin and hyper-charge for each choice of this kind.
This means breaking down of the isometries to a subgroup. This can be compensated by the
fact that the union can be taken over the diﬀerent choices of this subgroup.
5. p-Adicization requires a further breakdown to discrete subgroups of the resulting sub-groups of
the isometry groups but again a union over sub-WCWs corresponding to diﬀerent choices of the

402
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
discrete subgroup can be assumed. Discretization relates also naturally to the notion of number
theoretic braid.
8.2.2
WCW spinor ﬁelds
In TGD framework zero energy states correspond to the modes of completely classical WCW spinor
ﬁelds with fermionic second quantization at space-time level having purely geometric interpretation
at the level of WCW. The analysis of the degrees of freedom involved demonstrates that WCW spinor
ﬁelds are analogous to ordinary quantum ﬁelds but hav inﬁnite number of components.
1. WCW decomposes to a sub-WCWs association with unions of causal diamonds (CDs). Individ-
ual CD is partially characterized by the moduli deﬁned by the positions of its upper and lower
tips. The proposal is that the temporal distances between the tips are quantized in octaves
of CP2 time scale and thus coming in good approximation as secondary p-adic time scales for
primes very neary to power of two. The most general proposal is that also the position of the
upper tip at proper time = constant hyperboloid of future lightcone M 4
+ is quantized for positive
energy states. For negative energy states this happens to the lower tip. This disrete set would
provide a discretized quantum version of Robertson-Walker cosmology with discretized lattice
like structure replacing the continuum. The interpretation would be that ﬁrst tip corresponds
to the usual Minkowski space-time of special relativity and the discretized position of second tip
- or rather the space M 4
+ representing the relative position of the tips- to the space-time of cos-
mology. This implies very strong predictions such as the quantization of cosmic redshifts which
is indeed observed [K74] . Similar quantization would take place in CP2 degrees of freedom for
either tip. WCW spinor ﬁelds for single CD would depend on these moduli and for positive
(negative) states one would have wave functions in the space formed by sub-WCWs with wave
function basis consisting of products of plane waves in M 4 with a wave function in the dis-
crete subset of M 4
±. These degrees of freedom generalize those of a quantum ﬁeld in Minkowski
space. If the upper tip is assigned with observer, the sub-CDs in the interior of CD correspond
to astrophysical objects and M 4
+ as empty Robertson-Walker cosmology predicts automatically
cosmic redshift.
2. The notion of generalized imbdding space forces to assign to a given CD a selection of quan-
tization axis of energy and spin which in the case of M 4 boils down to a choice of a preferred
plane M 2 ⊂M 4 plus a choice of time direction (rest system). In the case of CP2 the choice
of quantization axes of color isospin and hypercharge means a choice of a homologically trivial
geodesic sphere of CP2 plus preferred isospin quantization axes. The space for possible choices
of quantization axis deﬁnes additional moduli. The selection of quantization axes in state func-
tion reduction means a localization in these degrees of freedom. The space characterizing the
selections of color quantization axis represents an example of so called ﬂag manifold. It has
already earlier appeared in TGD inspired biology with a motivation coming from the observa-
tion of topologists Barbara Shipman that the mathematical model for honeybee dance leads
naturally to the introduction of this space. Shipman speculated that quarks have some role in
biology [A21] . Dark matter hierarchy indeed makes indeed possible scaled up copies of QCD
type theory in biological length scales.
3. WCW spinor ﬁelds restricted to a CD with ﬁxed moduli have inﬁnite number of bosonic and
fermionic degrees of freedom. Spin-like degrees of freedom for these ﬁelds correspond to WCW
spinors, which describe many-fermion states consisting of quarks and leptons and bosons deﬁned
as their bound states. This Fock state is assigned to each 3-surface and the dependence on 3-
surface deﬁnes purely bosonic (’orbital’) degrees of freedom, which can be coded by using a
state basis whose elements have well-deﬁned spin and color quantum numbers. The bosonic and
fermionic degrees of freedom are super-symmetrically related.
Is it really possible to speak about zero energy states for a given sector deﬁned by generalized
imbedding space with ﬁxed M 2 and S2? Classically this is possible and conserved quantities are well
deﬁned. In quantal situation the presence of the light-cone boundaries breaks full Poincare invariance
although the inﬁnitesimal version of this invariance is preserved.
Note that the basic dynamical
objects are 3-D light-like ”legs” of the generalized Feynman diagrams glued together along their ends
at generalized vertices.

8.2.3
Deﬁnition of energy in zero energy ontology
The approach relying on the two super conformal structures of quantum TGD gives hopes of deﬁning
the notion of energy for positive and negative energy parts of the state.
1. CD allows translational invariance only in its interior and since partonic two surfaces are located
to the boundary of CD, one can argue that translations assigned to them lead out from CD.
One can however argue that if it is enough to assign eigentates of four-momentum to partons
and require that only the total four-momentum generators acts on the physical state by shifting
CD. Since total four-momentum vanishes for CD this would mean that wave function in cm
degrees of CD is just constant plane wave. Super-conformal invariance would indeed allow to
assign momentum eigenstates to the super-conformal representations.
2. A more stringent condition would be that four-momentum generators act as translation like
operators on partons themselves. Since light-like 3-surfaces assignable to incoming and outgo-
ing legs of the generalized Feynman diagrams are the basic objects, one can hope of having
enough translational invariance to deﬁne the notion of energy.
If translations are restricted
to time-like translations acting in the direction of the future (past) then one has local trans-
lation invariance of dynamics for classical ﬁeld equations inside δM 4
± as a kind of semigroup.
Also the M 4 translations leading to interior of X4 from the light-like 2-surfaces surfaces act as
translations. Classically these restrictions correspond to non-tachyonic momenta deﬁning the
allowed directions of translations realizable as particle motions. These two kinds of translations
have been assigned to super-symplectic conformal symmetries at δM 4
± × CP2 and and super
Kac-Moody type conformal symmetries at light-like 3-surfaces. Equivalence Principle in TGD
framework states that these two conformal symmetries deﬁne a structure completely analogous
to a coset representation of conformal algebras so that the four-momenta associated with the
two representations are identical [K17] .
Finite M 4 translations to the interior of CD do not respect the shape of the partonic 2-surface.
Local M 4 translations vanishing at the boundary of CD however act as Kac-Moody symmetries
of the light-like 3-surfaces and reduce physically to gauge transformations: hence one could allow
also the deformations of the partonic 2-surface in the interior of the light-like 3-surface. This
corresponds to the eﬀective metric 2-dimensionality stating that all information both about the
geometry of WCW and quantum physics is carried by the partonic 2-surfaces X2 resulting as
intersections of the light-like 3-surfaces X3
l and space-like 3-D surfaces X3 at the boundaries of
CD and the distribution of 4-D tangent planes of X2.
3. The condition selecting preferred extremals of K¨ahler action is induced by a global selection of
M 2 ⊂M 4 as a plane belonging to the tangent space of X4 at all its points [K17] and interpreted
as a plane of nonphysical polarizations so that direct connection with number theory and gauge
symmetries emerges. The M 4 translations of X4 as a whole in general respect the form of this
condition in the interior. Furthermore, if M 4 translations are restricted to M 2, also the condition
itself - rather than only its general form - is respected. This observation, the earlier experience
with p-adic mass calculations, and also the treatment of quarks and gluons in QCD encourage to
consider the possibility that translational invariance should be restricted to M 2 translations so
that mass squared, longitudinal momentum and transversal mass squared would be well deﬁned
quantum numbers. This would be enough to realize zero energy ontology. Encouragingly, M 2
appears also in the generalization of the causal diamond to a book-like structure forced by the
realization of the hierarchy of Planck constant at the level of the imbedding space.
4. That the cm degrees of freedom for CD would be gauge like degrees of freedom sounds strange.
The paradoxical feeling disappears as one realizes that this is not the case for sub-CDs, which
indeed can have non-trivial correlation functions with either upper or lower tip of the CD playing
a role analogous to that of an argument of n-point function in QFT description. One can also
say that largest CD in the hierarchy deﬁnes infrared cutoﬀ.
8.2.4
p-Adic variants of the imbedding space
The need to fuse p-adic physics with TGD emerged originally from the discovery that p-adic mass cal-
culations based on p-adic thermodynamics give excellent predictions for elementary particle masses if

404
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
one assumes p-adic length scale hypothesis stating that primes near integer powers of 2 are physically
favored [K89] . Later came the interpretation of p-adic physics as cognition cognition and intentional-
ity. The following somewhat technical construction of p-adic variants of the imbedding space provides
new insights concerning the understanding of the arrow of geometric time.
1. Rational values of p-adic coordinates are non-negative so that light-cone proper time a4,+ =
p
t2 −z2 −x2 −y2 is the unique Lorentz invariant choice for the p-adic time coordinate near the
lower tip of CD. For the upper tip the identiﬁcation of a4 would be a4,−=
p
(t −T)2 −z2 −x2 −y2.
In the p-adic context the simultaneous existence of both square roots poses additional conditions
on T. For 2-adic numbers T = 2nT0, n ≥0 (or more generally T = P
k≥n0 bk2k), would allow
to satisfy these conditions, which would be one additional reason for T = 2nT0 implying p-adic
length scale hypothesis. The remaining coordinates of CD are naturally (hyperbolic) cosines
and sines of the spherical coordinates θ and φ (hyperbolic angle η±,4).
2. The existence of the preferred plane M 2 of un-physical polarizations would suggest that 2-D
light-cone proper times a2,+ =
√
t2 −z2 a2,−=
p
(t −T)2 −z2 can be also considered. The
remaining coordinates would be naturally η±,2 and cylindrical coordinates (ρ, φ).
3. The p-adically transcendental values of a4 and a2 are literally inﬁnite as real numbers and could
be visualized as points in inﬁnitely distant geometric future so that the arrow of time might be
said to emerge number theoretically.
4. The selection of the preferred quantization axes of energy and angular momentum unique apart
from a Lorentz transformation of M 2 would have purely number theoretic meaning in both
cases. One must allow a union over sub-WCWs labeled by points of SO(1, 1). This suggests a
deep connection between number theory, quantum theory, quantum measurement theory, and
even quantum theory of mathematical consciousness.
5. In the case of CP2 there are three real coordinate patches involved [A26] . The compactness of
CP2 allows to use cosines and sines of the preferred angle variable for a given coordinate patch.
ξ1
=
tan(u)exp(i(Ψ + Φ)
2
)cos(Θ
2 ) ,
ξ2
=
tan(u)exp(i(Ψ −Φ)
2
)sin(Θ
2 ) .
(8.2.1)
The ranges of the variables u, Θ, Φ, Ψ are [0, π/2], [0, π], [0, 4π], [0, 2π] respectively. Note that u
has naturally only positive values in the allowed range. S2 corresponds to the values Φ = Ψ = 0
of the angle coordinates.
6. The rational values of the (hyperbolic) cosine and sine correspond to Pythagorean triangles
having sides of integer length and thus satisfying m2 = n2 +r2 (m2 = n2 −r2). These conditions
are equivalent and allow the well-known explicit solution [A1] . One can construct a p-adic
completion for the set of Pythagorean triangles by allowing p-adic integers which are inﬁnite as
real integers as solutions of the conditions m2 = r2 ± s2. These angles correspond to genuinely
p-adic directions having no real counterpart. Hence one obtains p-adic continuum also in the
angle degrees of freedom. Algebraic extensions of the p-adic numbers bringing in cosines and
sines of the angles π/n lead to a hierarchy increasingly reﬁned algebraic extensions of generalized
imbedding space. Since the diﬀerent sectors of WCW directly serve as correlates of selves, this
means a direct correlation with the evolution of the mathematical consciousness. Trigonometric
identities allow to construct points which in the real context correspond to sums and diﬀerences
of angles.
7. Negative rational values of the cosines and sines correspond as p-adic integers to inﬁnite real
numbers and it seems that one use several coordinate patches obtained as copies of the octant
(x ≥0, y ≥0, z ≥0, ). An analogous picture applies in CP2 degrees of freedom.

8.3. Zero energy ontology, self hierarchy, and the notion of time
405
8.3
Zero energy ontology, self hierarchy, and the notion of
time
Consider now the formulation of TGD inspired quantum theory of consciousness [L8] and quantum
biology [L7] in terms of zero energy ontology.
One should understand the asymmetry between positive and negative energies and between two
directions of geometric time at the level of conscious experience, the correspondence between experi-
enced and geometric time, and the emergence of the arrow of time. One should explain why human
sensory experience is about a rather narrow time interval of about .1 seconds and why memories are
about the interior of much larger CD with time scale of order life time. One should have a vision
about the evolution of consciousness: how quantum leaps leading to an expansion of consciousness
occur.
Negative energy signals to geometric past - about which phase conjugate laser light represents an
example - provide an attractive tool to realize intentional action as a signal inducing neural activities in
the geometric past (this would explain Libet’s classical ﬁndings), a mechanism of remote metabolism,
and the mechanism of declarative memory as communications with geometric past.
One should
understand how these signals are realized in zero energy ontology and why their occurrence is so rare.
In the following I try to demonstrate that TGD inspired theory of consciousness and quantum
TGD proper indeed are in tune.
8.3.1
Space-time and imbedding space correlates for selves
Quantum jump as a moment of consciousness, self as a sequence of quantum jumps integrating to self,
and self hierarchy with sub-selves experienced as mental images, are the basic notions of TGD inspired
theory of consciousness. In the most ambitious vision self hierarchy reduces to a fractal hierarchy of
quantum jumps within quantum jumps. Quantum classical correspondence demands selves to have
space-time correlates both at the level of space-time and imbedding space.
At the level of space-time the ﬁrst guess for the correlates is as light-like or space-like 3-surfaces. If
one believes on eﬀective 2-dimensionality and quantum holography, partonic 2-surfaces plus their 4-D
tangent space distribution would code the information about the space-time correlates. By quantum
classical correspondence one can also identify space-time sheets as the correlates modulo the gauge
degeneracy implied by super-conformal symmetries.
It is natural to interpret CDs as correlates of selves at the level of the imbedding space. CDs can
be interpreted either as subsets of the generalized imbedding space or as sectors of WCW. Accordingly,
selves correspond to CDs of the generalized imbedding space or sectors of WCW, literally separate
interacting quantum Universes.
The spiritually oriented reader might speak of Gods.
Sub-selves
correspond to sub-CDs geometrically. The contents of consciousness of self is about the interior of the
corresponding CD at the level of imbedding space. For sub-selves the wave function for the position
of tip of CD brings in the delocalization of sub-WCW.
The fractal hierarchy of CDs within CDs is the geometric counterpart for the hierarchy of selves:
the quantization of the time scale of planned action and memory as T(k) = 2kT0 suggest an interpre-
tation for the fact that we experience octaves as equivalent in music experience.
8.3.2
Why sensory experience is about so short time interval?
CD picture implies automatically the 4-D character of conscious experience and memories form part
of conscious experience even at elementary particle level. Amazingly, the secondary p-adic time scale
of electron is T = 0.1 seconds deﬁning a fundamental time scale in living matter. The problem is to
understand why the sensory experience is about a short time interval of geometric time rather than
about the entire personal CD with temporal size of order life-time. The explanation would be that
sensory input corresponds to subselves (mental images) with T ≃.1 s at the upper light-like boundary
of CD in question. This requires a strong asymmetry between upper and lower light-like boundaries
of CDs.
The localization of the contents of the sensory experience to the upper light-cone boundary and
local arrow of time could emerge as a consequence of self-organization process involving conscious
intentional action. Sub-CDs would be in the interior of CD and self-organization process would lead

406
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
to a distribution of CDs concentrated near the upper or lower boundary of CD. The local arrow of
geometric time would depend on CD and even diﬀer for CD and sub-CDs.
1. The localization of contents of sensory experience to a narrow time interval would be due to
the concentration of sub-CDs representing mental images near the either boundary of CD
representing self.
2. Phase conjugate signals identiﬁable as negative energy signals to geometric past are important
when the arrow of time diﬀers from the standard one in some time scale. If the arrow of time
establishes itself as a phase transition, this kind of situations are rare. Negative energy signals
as a basic mechanism of intentional action and transfer of metabolic energy would explain why
living matter is so special.
3. Geometric memories would correspond to subselves in the interior of CD, the oldest of them
to the regions near ”lower” boundaries of CD. Since the density of sub-CDs is small there
geometric memories would be rare and not sharp. A temporal sequence of mental images, say
the sequence of digits of a phone number, would correspond to a temporal sequence of sub-CDs.
4. Sharing of mental images corresponds to a fusion of sub-selves/mental images to single sub-self
by quantum entanglement: the space-time correlate could be ﬂux tubes connecting space-time
sheets associated with sub-selves represented also by space-time sheets inside their CDs.
8.3.3
Arrow of time
TGD forces a new view about the relationship between experienced and geometric time. Although the
basic paradox of quantum measurement theory disappears the question about the arrow of geometric
time remains. There are actually two times involved. The geometric time assignable to the space-time
sheets and the M 4 time assignable to the imbedding space.
Consider ﬁrst the the geometric time assignable to the space-time sheets.
1. Selves correspond to CDs. The CDs and their projections to the imbedding space do not move
anywhere. Therefore the standard explanation for the arrow of geometric time cannot work.
2. The only plausible interpretation at classical level relies on quantum classical correspondence and
the fact that space-times are 4-surfaces of the imbedding space. If quantum jump corresponds
to a shift for a quantum superposition of space-time sheets towards geometric past in the ﬁrst
approximation (as quantum classical correspondence suggests), one can understand the arrow
of time. Space-time surfaces simply shift backwards with respect to the geometric time of the
imbedding space and therefore to the 8-D perceptive ﬁeld deﬁned by the CD. This creates in the
materialistic mind a temporal variant of train illusion. Space-time as 4-surface and macroscopic
and macro-temporal quantum coherence are absolutely essential for this interpretation to make
sense.
Why this shifting should always take place to the direction of geometric past of the imbedding
space? Does it so always? The proposed mechanism for the localization of sensory experience to a
short time interval suggests an explanation in terms of intentional action.
1. CD deﬁnes the perceptive ﬁeld for self.
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) or its
strenghtened form could be used to justify the hypothesis that selves quite universally love to
gain information about the un-known.
In other words, they are curious to know about the
space-time sheets outside their perceptive ﬁeld (the future). Therefore they perform quantum
jumps tending to shift the superposition of the space-time sheets so that unknown regions of
space-time sheets emerge to the perceptive ﬁeld. Either the upper or lower boundary of CD
wins in the competition and the arrow of time results as a spontaneous symmetry breaking. The
arrow of time can depend on CD but tends to be the same for CD and its sub-CDs. Global
arrow of time could establish itself by a phase transitions establishing the same arrow of time
globally by a mechanism analogous to percolation phase transition.

8.3. Zero energy ontology, self hierarchy, and the notion of time
407
2. Since the news come from the upper boundary of CD, self concentrates its attention to this re-
gion and improves the resolution of sensory experience. The sub-CDs generated in this manner
correspond to mental images with contents about this region. Hence the contents of conscious
experience, in particular sensory experience, tends to be about the region near the upper bound-
ary.
3. Note that the space-time sheets need not to continue outside the CD of self but self does not
know this and believes that there is something there to be curious about. The quantum jumps
inducing what reduces to a shift in region suﬃciently far from upper boundary of CD creates
a new piece of space-time surface! The non-continuation of the space-time sheet outside CD
would be a correlate for the fact that subjective future does not exist.
The emergence of the arrow of time at the level of imbedding space reduces to a modiﬁcation of
the oldest TGD based argument for the arrow of time which is wrong as such. If physical objects
correspond to 3-surfaces inside future directed light-cone then the sequence of quantum jumps implies
a diﬀusion to the direction of increasing value of light-cone propert time. The modiﬁcation of the
argument goes as follows.
1. CDs are characterized by their moduli. In particular, the relative coordinate for the tips of CD
has values in past light cone M 4
−if the future tip is taken as the reference point. An attractive
interpretation for the proper time of M 4
−is as cosmic time having quantized values. Quantum
states correspond to wave functions in the modular degrees of freedom and each U process
creates a non-localized wave function of this kind. Suppose that state function reduction implies
a localization in the modular degrees of freedom so that CD is ﬁxed completely apart from its
center of mass position to which zero four-momentum constant plane wave is assigned. One can
expect that in average sense diﬀuction occurs in M 4
−so that the size of CD tends to increase
and that the most distant geometric past deﬁned by the past boundary of CD recedes. This is
nothing but cosmic expansion. This provides a formulation for the ﬂow of time in terms of a
cosmic redshift. This argument applies also to the positions of the sub-CDs inside CD. Also
their proper time distance from the tip of CD is expected to increase.
2. One can argue that one ends up with contradiction by changing the roles of upper and lower
tips. In the case of CD itself is only the proper time distance between the tips which increases
and speaking about ”future” and ”past” tips is only a convention. For sub-CDs of CD the
argument would imply that the sub-CDs drifting from the opposite tips tend to concentrate in
the middle region of CD unless either tip is in a preferred position. This requires a spontaneous
selection of the arrow of time. One could say that the cosmic expansion implied by the drift in
M 4
−”draws” the space-time sheet with it to the geometric past. The spontaneous generation of
the asymmetry between the tips might require the ”curious” conscious entities.
8.3.4
The mechanism of self reference
Self reference is perhaps the most mysterious aspect of conscious experience. When formulated in
somewhat loose manner self reference states that self can be conscious about being conscious of
something. When trying to model this ability in say computer paradigm one is easily led to inﬁnite
regress. In TGD framework a weaker form of self referentiality holds true: self can become conscious
that it was conscious of something in previous quantum jump(s). Self reference therefore reduces to
memory. Inﬁnite regress is replaced with evolution recreating Universe again and again and adding
new reﬂective levels of consciousness. It is however essential to have also the experience that memory
is in question in order to have self reference.
This knowledge implies that a reﬂective level is in
question.
The mechanism of self reference would reduce to the ability to code information about quantum
jump into the geometry and topology of the space-time surface. This representation deﬁnes an analog
of written text which can be read if needed: memory recall is this reading process. The existence of
this kind of representations means quantum classical correspondence in a generalized sense: not only
quantum states but also quantum jump sequences responsible for conscious experience can be coded
to the space-time geometry. The reading of this text induces self-organization process re-generating
the original conscious experience or at least some aspects of it (say verbal representation of it). The

408
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
failure of strict classical determinism for K¨ahler action is absolutely essential for the possibility to
realize quantum classical correspondence in this sense.
Consider now the problem of coding conscious experience to space-time geometry and topology so
that it can be read again in memory recall. Let us ﬁrst list what I believe to know about memories.
1. In TGD framework memories corresponds to sub-CDs inside CDs and are located in geometric
past. This means fundamental diﬀerence from neuroscience view according to which memories
are in the geometric now. Note that standard physicist would argue that this does not make
sense: by the determinism of ﬁeld equations one cannot think 4-dimensionally. In TGD however
ﬁeld equations fail to be deterministic in the standard sense: this actually led to the introduction
of zero energy ontology.
2. The reading wakes up mental images which are essentially 4-D self-organization patterns inside
sub-CDs in the geometric past. Metabolic energy is needed to achieve this wake up. What
is needed is generation of space-time sheets representing the potential images making possible
memories.
This picture combined with the mechanism for generating the arrow of phychological time and
explaining why sensory experience is located to so short time interval as it is (.1 second, the time scale
of CD associated with electron by p-adic length scale hypothesis) allows to understand the mechanism
of self reference. It deserves to be mentioned that the discussion with Stephen Paul King in Time
discussion group served as the midwife for this step of progress.
1. When the ﬁlm makes a shift to the direction of geometric past in quantum jump subselves repre-
senting mental images representing the reaction to the ”news” are generated. These correspond
to sub-CDs contains space-time surfaces as correlates of subselves created and the information
contents of immediate conscious experiences is about this region of space-time and imbedding
space.
They are like additional comment marks on the ﬁlm giving information about what
feelings the news from the geometric future stimulated.
2. In subsequent quantum jumps ﬁlm moves downwards towards geometric past and markings
deﬁned in terms of space-time correlates for mental images are shifted backwards with the ﬁlm
and deﬁne the coding of information about previous conscious experience. In memory recall
metabolic energy is feeded to these subsystems and they wake up and regenerate the mental
images about the remembered aspect sof the previous conscious experience. This would not be
possible in positive energy ontology and if determinism in strict sense of the world would hold
true.
3. Something must bring in the essential information that these experiences are memories rather
than genuine sensory experiences (say). Something must distinguish between genuine experiences
and memories about them. The space-time sheets representing self reference deﬁne cognitive
representations. If the space-time sheets representing the correlates for self-referential mental
images are p-adic, this distinction emerges naturally. That these space-time sheets are in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds is actually enough and also makes possible negentropic en-
tanglement carrying the conscious information. In TGD inspired quantum biology this property
is indeed the deﬁning characteristic of life.
4. There is quite concrete mechanism for the realization of memories in terms of braidings of
magnetic ﬂux tubes discussed in [K23] .
Interesting questions relate to the role of p-adicity and the realization of the active aspects of
consciousness. One can consider also quantum jumps in which the space-time surface inside CD does
not suﬀer mere passive shift downwards but is aﬀected also in the geometric past. The mechanism of
intentional action, which could have been inspired by Libet’s ﬁnding that neuronal activity seems to
precede conscious decision, can be understood in terms of negative energy signals sent to the geometric
past, where they generate neuronal activity replacing the space-time surface with a new one.
If p-adicity is involved, the possibility seems that comes to mind is that the space-time sheets
representing the signal to the geometric past are ﬁrst generated as p-adic space-time sheets representing
intention and transformed in quantum jump to their real counterparts representing the ”desire” for
action in turn generating the action.

Can selves interact and evolve?
Interesting questions relate to how dynamical selves are.
1. Is self doomed to live inside the same sub-WCW eternally as a lonely god? This question has
been already answered: there are interactions between sub-CDs of given CD, and one can think
of selves as quantum superposition of states in CDs with wave function having as its argument
the tips of CD, or rather only the second one since T is assumed to be quantized.
2. Is there largest CD in the personal CD hierarchy of self in an absolute sense? Or is the largest
CD present only in the sense that the contribution to the contents of consciousness coming from
very large CDs is negligible? Long time scales T correspond to low frequencies and thermal
noise might mask these contributions.
Here however the hierarchy of Planck constants and
generalization of the imbedding space could come in rescue by allowing dark EEG photons to
have energies above thermal energy.
3. Can selves evolve in the sense that the size of CD increases in quantum leaps so that the
corresponding time scale T = 2kT0 of memory and planned action increases? Geometrically
this kind of leap would mean that CD becomes a sub-CD of a larger CD - either at the level
of conscious experience or in absolute sense. The leap can occur in two senses: as an increase
of the largest p-adic time scale in the personal hierarchy of space-time sheets or as increase of
the largest value of Planck constants in the personal dark matter hierarchy. At the level of
individual organism this would mean emergence of new lower frequencies of generalized EEG
and levels of personal dark matter hierarchy with larger value of Planck constant.

What arrow of time means at the level of quantum states
?
The above discussion does not touch the question what arrow of time means at the level of quantum
states. Therefore the notion of negative energy signal propagating backwards in geometric time crucial
for TGD inspired quantum biology remains somewhat fuzzy. The recent progress in the understanding
of the basic properties of zero energy states makes it possible to understand what arrow of geometric
time and the notion of negative energy state and signals propagating to the direction of geomeric past
mean at the level of zero energy states. This understanding has surprisingly non-trivial philosophical
implications.
8.4.1
Arrow of time as an inherent property of zero energy states
The basic idea can be expressed in very conscise form. In positive energy ontology arrow of time
characterizes dynamics. In zero energy ontology arrow of time characterizes quantum states.
1. The breaking of time reversal invariance means that zero energy states can be localized with
respect to particle number and other quantum numbers only for future or past light-like boundary
of CD but not both.
M-matrix generalizing S−matrix provides the time-like entanglement
coeﬃcients expressing the state at the second boundary as quantum superposition of states with
well-deﬁned particle numbers and other quantum numbers. But only at the second end of CD
since one cannot choose freely the states at both boundaries: if this were the case the counterpart
of Schr¨odinger equation would be completely non-deterministic. This is what the breaking of
time reversal symmetry means. It occurs spontaneously and assigns to the arrow of subjective
time geometric arrow of time.
This picture gives a precise meaning to the arrow of geometric time and therefore also for the
otherwise fuzzy notion of negative energy signals propagating backwards in space-time playing
key role in TGD based models of memory, metabolism, and intentional action [?]
2. Quantum jump begins with the unitary U-process between zero energy states generating a su-
perposition of zero energy states. After that follows state function reduction cascade proceeding
from the level of CD to the level of sub-CDs forming a fractal hierarchy. The reductions can-
not take independently at both light-like boundaries of CD as is also clear from the fact that
scattering state leads from a prepared state to a quantum superposition of prepared states.

410
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
The ﬁrst guess is that the cascade takes place for the second boundary of CD only so that
the arrow of geometric time would be same in all scales. This need not be the case always:
the geometric arrow of time seems to change in some situations: phase conjugate laser light
and spontaneous self-assembly of bio-molecules are good examples about this [K86, K87]. In
fact, one of the deﬁning properties of living matter could be just the possibility that the arrow
of geometric time is not same in all scales (size scales of CDs) so that memory, metabolism,
and intentional action become possible. In any case, the second end remains a superposition of
quantum states.
The lack of quantum measurements at the second end of space-times could explain why the
conscious percepts are sharply localized in time at the second end of CD. This could also allow
to understand memories as reductions occurring at the second, non-standard, end of sub-CDs
in the geometric past.
3. The correspondence between the reduced state and the quantum superposition of states at the
opposite boundary of CD allows an interpretation in terms of logical implication arrow with
all statements present in the superposition implying the statement represented by the reduced
state. Only implication arrow rather than equivalence is possible unless the M-matrix is diagonal
meaning that there are no interactions. If it is possible to diagonalize M-matrix then in diagonal
basis one has equivalences. It must be however emphasized that the physically preferred state
basis ﬁxed as in terms of eigenstates of density matrix does not allow diagonal M-matrix.
Number theoretic conditions required that the density matrix corresponds to ﬁxed algebraic
extension of rationals can also make possible the diagonalization without leaving the extension
and this condition might be highly relevant in the TGD inspired view about cognition relying
on p-adic number ﬁelds and their algebraic extensions [K79].
4. In classical logic implication corresponds to the inclusion of subset by subset. In quantum case it
corresponds to the inclusion for sub-space of state space. The inclusions of hyper-ﬁnite factors
(WCW spinors deﬁne HFF of type II1) realize the notion of ﬁnite measurement resolution,
which would suggest that inclusion arrow has also interpretation in terms of ﬁnite measurement
resolution.
All quantum states equivalent with a given state in the resolution used imply it. Finite mea-
surement resolution would mean that there would inﬁnite number of instances always in the
quantum superposition representing the rule A →B. Ironically, both ﬁnite measurement reso-
lution and dissipation implying the arrow of geometric time and usually regarded as something
negative from the point of view of information processing would be absolutely essential element
of logical thinking in this framework.
5. Conscious theorem proving would has as correlate to building of sequences zero energy states
representing A →B, B →C, C →D with basic building bricks representing simple basic rules.
These sequences would represent more complex truths.
8.4.2
Does state function-state preparation sequence correspond to alter-
nating arrow of geometric time?
The state function reduction at light-like boundary of CD implies delocalization at the opposite
boundary. This inspires so fascinating questions.
1. Could the state function reduction process take place alternately at the two boundaries of CD
so that a kind of ﬂip-ﬂop in which the arrow of geometric time changes back and forth would
result, and have interpretation as an alternating sequence of state function reductions and state
preparations in the framework of positive energy ontology?
2. State function reductions are needed for sensory percepts.
Could the sleep-wake-up period
correspond to this kind of process so that during what we call sleep the past boundary of our
personal CD would be in wake-up state? Could dreams and memories represent sharing of mental
images of this kind of consciousness? Could it be that in the time scale of entire life cycle death
is accompanied by birth at the second boundary of personal CD? Could this quantum physics

8.4. What arrow of time means at the level of quantum states
411
representation for endless sequence of deaths and rebirths? Could the fact that old people often
spend they last years in childhood have interpretation in this framework?
3. State preparation-reduction cycle might characterize only living matter whereas for inanimate
matter second choice for the arrow of time would be dominant between two U-processes. TGD
based reformulation [K84] of entropic gravity idea of Verlinde [B16] in terms of ZEO does not
assume the absence of gravitons and the emergence of space-time. The formulation leads to
the proposal that thermodynamical stability selects the arrow of the geometric time and that
it could be diﬀerent for matter and antimatter implying that matter and antimatter reside at
diﬀerent space-time sheets. This would explain the apparent absence of antimatter and also
support the view that the arrow alternates only in living matter.
8.4.3
The arrow of geometric time and the arrow of logical implication
If physics is mathematics in the sense that there is nothing behind quantum states regarded as purely
mathematical objects, Boolean logic must have a direct manifestation in the structure of physical
states.
Physical states should represent quantal Boolean statements which get their meaning via
quantum jumps. In TGD framework WCW (”world of classical worlds”) spinor ﬁelds represent quan-
tum states of the Universe and WCW spinors correspond to fermionic Fock states for second quantized
induced spinor ﬁelds at space-time surface. Fock state basis has interpretation in terms of Boolean
algebra. In positive energy ontology the problem is that fermion number as a super-selection rule
would allow very limited number of Boolean statements to be represented. In ZEO the situation
changes.
The fermionic parts of positive and negative energy parts can be seen as quantum superpositions
of Boolean statements with fermion number in given mode (equal to 0 or 1) representing yes/no or
true/false. Also various spin like quantum numbers associated with oscillator operators have same
interpretation.
Zero energy state could be seen as quantum superposition of pairs of elements of
Boolean algebras associated with positive and negative energy parts of the zero energy state.
The ﬁrst - and incorrect - interpretation is that zero energy state represents a quantum superpo-
sition of equivalent statements a ↔b and thus abstraction A ↔B involving several instances of A
and B. The breaking of time reversal invariance allowing localization to deﬁnite fermionic quantum
numbers at single end of CD only however implies that quantum states can only represent abstraction
of logical implication to A →B rather than equivalence. p-Adic physics for various primes pc [?]ould
represent correlates for cognition and intentionality.
8.4.4
How experienced time and the geometric time of physicist relate to
each other?: the most recent approach
The relationship between experienced time and time of physicis is one of the basic puzzles of modern
physics. In the proposed framework they are certainly two diﬀerent things and the challenge is to
understand why the correlation between them is so strong that it has led to their identiﬁcation. One
can imagine several alternative views explaining this correlation [K86, K87, K3] and it is better to
keep mind open.
Basic questions
The ﬂow of subjective time corresponds to quantum jump sequences for sub-selves of self having in-
terpretation as mental images. If mind is completely empty of mental images subjectively experienced
time ceases to exists. This leaves however several questions to be answered.
1. Why the contents of conscious of self comes from a ﬁnite space-time region looks like an easy
question. If the contents of consciousness for subselves representing mental images is localized
to the sub-CDs with indeed have deﬁned temporal position inside CD assigned with the self
the contents of consciousness is indeed from a ﬁnite space-time volume. This implies a new
view about memory. There is no need to store again and again memories to the ”brain now”
since the communications with the geometric past by negative energy signals and also time-like
negentropic quantum entanglement allow the sharing of the mental images of the geometric past.

412
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
2. There are also more diﬃcult questions. Subjective time has arrow and has only the recent and
possibly also past. The subjective past could in principle reduce to subjective now if conscious
experience is about 4-D space-time region so that memories would be always geometric memories.
How these properties of subjective time are transferred to apparent properties of geometric time?
How the arrow of geometric time is induced? How it is possible that the locus for the contents
of conscious experience shifts or at least seems to be shifted quantum jump by quantum jump to
the direction of geometric future? Why the sensory mental images are located in a narrow time
interval of about .1 seconds in the usual states of consciousness (not that sensory memories are
possible: scent memories and phantom pain in leg could be seen as examples of vivid sensory
memory)?
Just to make illustrate how many diﬀerent aspects are involved and in the hope that various
constraings would allow to select among many alternatives that one can imagine (and have imagined!),
let us ﬁrst try to list basic questions in the framework provided by ZEO.
1. ZEO forces the arrow of geometric time to become a property of zero energy states. What does
this mean concretely? Could the observed arrow of time reduce solely to this arrow?
2. Do sub-CD:s drift in preferred time direction inside CD? Or do space-time sheets drift inside CD
to preferred direction. Or is there a a phase transition proceeding in the direction of geometric
time of CD associated with the entire CD and inducing state function reduction for sub-CDs:
it would not matter what is boundary of sub-CD is selected if sub-CD would be eﬀectively
point-like. The quantum arrow of time for zero energy state should force preferred direction of
this phase transition.
3. Does the U process as a cascade proceeding from long scales of CDs to short ones involve
explicitly the arrow of geometrc time. For instance, could state function reduction cascade for
sub-CDs with a given scale correspond to a process analogous to burning proceeding towards
geometric future? Or could a phase transition transforming p-adic space-time sheets to real ones
as a realization of intentional action proceed in this manner?
4. Do space-time sheets possess an arrow of geometric time coming from the failure of strict deter-
minism (shock waves in hydrodynamics) and giving space-time correlate for the quantum arrow
of time? In hydrodynamics second law allows to select between alternative developments in
multi-furcation. Could second law or NMP be involved also now?
5. What is the role of the fractal hierarchy of CD? Also entanglement between sub-CDs carrying
zero energy states is possible. Could the state function reductions occurring for sub-CDs give
rise to the experience of ﬂow of time at the level of CD. Do these quantum jumps occur for
some reason ina time ordered manner (light-cone proper time deﬁnes a unique Lorentz invariant
time ordering). Could the entanglement anatomy of zero energy states force this automatically?
The process would be analogous to burning.
6. Suppose that the idea about time ﬂip-ﬂop meaning that unitary process reduces to a base
change between basis with opposite arrows of geometric time. Doesn’t this imply that the arrow
of geometric time changes its direction alternately or is there a manner to avoid this conclusion?
7. State function reduction involves a reduction of entanglement between quantum variables and
classical variables represented by zero modes in TGD Universe. Does this reduction play a kay
role in the generation of the arrow of time. What is the role of negentropic entanglement? For
instance, could it be that the generation of negentropic entanglement at second end of the CD
stabilizes the states with respect to state function reduction leading to counterpart of Orch OR?
8. The geometry of light-cone has intrinsic arrow of time. The question is how this arrow induces
the arrow of experienced geometric arrow of time with minimal assumption (from structure of
zero energy states).
9. The localization of sensory experience to short time interval does not deﬁne so strong constraint
as one might think since if sensory mental images correspond to small enough sub-CDs, the
localization inside sub-CD is enough. For CD itself the localization to either boundary looks
naturl since state function reduction takes place at the boundary.

8.4. What arrow of time means at the level of quantum states
413
First trial
Possible answers to these questions could rely on NMP if understood as a suﬃciently general principle.
Suppose that NMP translates to the statement that selves are eager to gain conscious information.
The mere assumption that selves are curious leaves a lot of room for alternatives and one can imagine
several models. Note also that geometric time can correspond to the local time assignable to space-time
sheet or to the cosmic time assignable to the CD or to 8-D imbedding space.
1. The space-time in the geometric future above the ”upper” light-like boundary of CD represents
the unknown where the news come from. Negentropic self has to some extent free will and can
perform quantum jumps inducing eﬀectively the shift of the quantum superposition of the space-
time surfaces towards geometric past. The news come from the future and represent sensory
input and induce subselves as mental images. The population of sensory subselves would tend
to be created near the ”upper” boundary of CD. This would induce a breaking of time reversal
invariance and spontanous arrow of geometric time. Self would be like a person in movie theater.
Self would not move anywhere, space-time surfaces -the ﬁlm- would move with respect to self.
2. One can consider also alternative view analogous to the standard view if one assumes that
the CDs representing subselves can shift towards geometric future in the sequence of quantum
jumps. Suppose that U process creates a quantum superposition over temporal positions of CD
and that temporal localization takes place during the state function reduction process. Also now
the strong form of NMP could force a drift of the sub-self population towards unkown deﬁning
the geometric future. The geometric time would be assignable to the larger CD. Also the ﬁrst
option allows drifting of subselves to the upper boundary of CS as a consequence of strong form
of NMP.
One might hope that spontaneous breaking of time reversal invariance alone could explain the
induced arrow of geometric time so that the arrow of time would not be a result of intentional action.
Following options represent attempts to understand the arrow of cosmic time as something analogous
to diﬀusion in half-space.
1. Self is a subself of larger self and the corresponding CD could induce a breaking of time reversal
invariance since the proper time coordinate for CD has only positive values so that a diﬀusion
and even drift towards geomeric future could result. If subself is nearer to the lower boundary
of the larger CD it tends to diﬀuse upwards and vice versa. In the middle of the larger CD,
where the analog of cosmic expansion changes to contraction geometric time would stop.
2. Second option is based on the observation that the size scale of given CD must increase on the
average during quantum jump sequence. These events correspond to phase transitions increasing
the size scale of CD by a factor of two and could serve as correlate for cosmic expansion. When
one ﬁxes either tip of CD, the second tip moves towards future with respect to it in discrete
phase transition like steps. This discrete time evolution might deﬁne a quantum correlate for
the ﬂow of cosmic time at imbedding space level [K74].
More detailed discussions of the problem can be found in [K3]. In any case, it must be admitted
that something important piece of understanding is still lacking.
The following represents one of
the many attempts to identify this piece and relies on single new input: zero energy states possess
quantum arrow of time.
Second trial
ZEO allows to assign to zero energy states an arrow of time naturally since one can require that states
have well deﬁned single particle quantum numbers at either upper or lower boundary of CD. Also the
spontaneous change of the arrow of geometric time is possible. The simplest possible description for
U-process is that U-matrix relates to each other these two kinds of states and state function reductions
occur alternately at upper and lower boundaries of CD meaning reduction to single particle states
with well deﬁned quantum numbers. The localization of sensory experience to short time interval
could also correspond to mental images with size scale of CD being about .1 seconds so that the
assumption that localization inside CD to either boundary takes place is not absolutely necessary.

414
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
It is unclear whether this identiﬁcation of the unitary process allows a generation of a universal
arrow of geometric time. It would seem that the arrow of time as a property of zero energy states
must alternate for the proposed mechanism. But is this really the case? To answer this question one
must try to understand how the observer concludes that there is geometric arrow of time.
1. This situation could correspond to single arrow of geometric time for a conscious entity if it
resides permanently at either boundary of CD: does this mean a sleep-awake cycle of conscious-
ness as a basic attribute of conscious experience? The hierarchy of CDs allows however to think
that the scale in which the arrow of time as deduced from cosmology alternates in time scale
of lifetime of the Universe so that unique arrow of time would be observed.
In time scales
shorter than that assignable to the CD of observer the arrow of time would vary periodically
(generalized sleep-wake cycle).
2. Does the time ﬂip-ﬂop between upper and lower boundaries of CD really give rise to a variation of
perceived arrow of geometric time? Suppose that quantum arrow of time has a direct counterpart
in the time evolution of preferred extremals (dissipative processes). The direction of classical
dissipation changes as the quantum arrow of time changes. Space-time evolution with a ﬁxed
geometric arrow of time would be eﬀectively folded forth and back.
If this were the case, it seems that self has no means of detecting this change in the classical
dynamics of preferred extremals assignable to its own CD. This if only the information about
space-time sheet is used. The only manner to detect the change of the arrow of time would by
looking the classical dynamics of larger CDs.
If the arrow for the larger C remains the same when the arrow of geometric time for CD
changes, self could detect the change of its own geometric arrow of time. For instance, self
would experience dissipation inside its own CD to take place in opposite direction compared
to that in larger scales. Here one however encounters a problem since in living systems the
dissipation indeed could take place in wrong direction: this has even inspired the introduction of
the notion of syntropy [J62]. Self should however observe that the clocks deﬁned by larger scale
system run in wrong direction. But if the single half-period in the reduction cycle corresponds
to life-cycle then also this is possible only after what we would call biological death!
Suppose that one just for a moment accepts this picture in absence of anything better. One can
argue that there must exist concrete correlates for the ﬂow of time experienced by self in terms of
quantum dynamics of sub-selves. One should understand what the fractal hierarchy of selves really
means at the level of conscious experience and of its physical correlates.
Several mechanisms at
space-time level for the generation of arrow of time have been discussed but the really satisfactory
mechanism remains to be identiﬁed.
Is there a phase transition proceeding in the direction of geometric time of CD associated with the
entire CD and inducing state function reduction for sub-CDs: it would not matter what is boundary
of sub-CD is selected if sub-CD would be eﬀectively point-like. The quantum arrow of time for zero
energy state should force preferred direction of this phase transition.
1. Could it be that this phase transition like process corresponds to a sequence of state function
reductions for sub-CDs of given size proceeding to the future. Could the fractal structure of
zero energy states give rise to this structure? Ordinary Feynman diagrams would describe only
single level in this hierarchy and state function reductions selecting subset of diagrams with
given incoming and outgoing states are not possible. Suppose that zero energy states satisfy in
very symbolic sense the recursion relation
Ψn = Ψn,0 +
X
0<k<n
Ψn−k ◦Ψk .
Here n corresponds to the size scale of CD. Ψn,0 corresponds an irreducible contribution corre-
sponding to the ordinary Feynman diagrams for which no state function reduction in intermedi-
ate states is possible: this would be like dropping out subset of Feynman diagrams. The second
term corresponds to splitting two two sub-CDs and is possible only in ZEO. We of course do
physics in various scales without formal theoretical justiﬁcation. For instance, we calculate QCD

8.4. What arrow of time means at the level of quantum states
415
type process we can restrict the consideration to corresponding time scales. The decomposition
would express this fact as a law of physics.
For these lower level contributions similar equation can be applied and one repeat the recursion
down to the lowest level. ◦symbolizes entanglement between the zero energy states Ψn−k and
Ψk.
2. Suppose that at the ﬁrst step state function reduction has led to prepared states at -say- upper
end (corresponding to Ψk). This is nothing but the basic assumption about zero energy states.
At the next step the reduction reduces the entanglement between Ψn−k and Ψk: essentially the
sum deﬁning an element for a product AB of matrices reduces to a product of two elements:
P
j AijBjk →AijBjk. Time ordering of the reductions is unavoidable at this level since sub-CDs
are in question. This process would continue fractally downwards to shorter scales. Complete
time ordering results if the reduction for Ψk proceeds to the short scales ﬁrst and only then for
Ψn−k. Othwerwise reduction sequences would occur for sub-CDs at diﬀerent temporal positions
simultaneously.
3. There is also entanglement with zero modes at each level but it seems that this entanglement
is not relevant for this argument reducing the arrow to recursive property of states and to the
factorization of two entangled zero energy states at given level of recursion.
4. This view about unitary process would explain the arrow of geometric time, explain why self
experiences lower level state functions as time ﬂow, and would also allow to understand the
localization of sensory and various other kinds of experiences and also intentional action to
short time interval.
8.4.5
Quantum dynamics for the moduli of CDs and the arrow of geometric
time
How the arrow of geometric time at the level of space-time and imbedding space is induced from the
arrow of subjective time identiﬁed in terms of sequence of quantum jumps forming a fractal hierarchy
of quantum jumps within quantum jumps? This is one of the long lasting puzzles of TGD and TGD
inspired theory of consciousness.
In zero energy ontology (ZEO) the geometry of CD (I often use the sloppy notation CD ≡CD ×
CP2, where the latter CD is deﬁned as the intersection of future and past directed light-cones) is that
of double light-cone (double pyramid) and this must relate closely to the problem at hand. An easy
manner to obtain absolute arrow of geometric time at least statistically is to assume that imbedding
space is M 4 + ×CP2- that is product of future like cone with CP2. The problem is however that
of ﬁnding a convincing quantal mechanism generating the arrow of time, and also explaining why
the geometric arrow of time sometimes changes from the standard one (say for phase conjugate laser
beams).
The latest vision about the generation of the arrow of geometric time the level of imbedding space
and space-time discussed in previous section involves rather radical features but is consistent with the
second law if generalized so that the geometric arrow of time at the level of imbedding level alternates
as state function reduction takes place alternately at opposite light-like boundaries of a ﬁxed CD.
If the partially non-deterministic dynamics at space-time level deﬁnes a correlate for the dissipative
dynamics of quantum jumps, the arrow of geometric time level at space-time level is constant (space-
time surface can assignable to the state function reductions can be seen as folded surface spanned
between boundaries of CD) and entropy deﬁnes monotonically increasing time coordinate. This is
rather radical revision of the standard view but makes deﬁnite predictions: in particular syntropic
aspects of the physics of living matter [J62] could be assigned with the non-standard direction of
geometric time at the space-time level.
This approach hower still suﬀers from a defect. CDs are regarded as completely non-dynamical:
once CD is created it remains the same from quantum jump to quantum jump and thus serves as a
ﬁxed arena of dynamics. This cannot be the case.
Some questions about CDs and their quantum dynamics
One can raise several questions relating to CDs.

416
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
1. CDs are assumed to form a fractal hierarchy of CDs within CDs. The size scale of CD has been
argued to come as an integer multiple of CP2 size scale on basis of number theoretic arguments.
One can ask whether CDs can overlap and interact and what interaction means.
2. What is the proper interpretation of CD? Could CD correspond to a spotlight of consciousness
directed to a particular region of space-time surface, so that space-time surface need not end at
the boundaries of CD as also generalized Feynman diagrammatics mildly suggests? Or do the
space-time surfaces end at the boundaries of CD so that CD deﬁnes a sub-Universe?
3. Should one assign CD to every subsystem - even elementary particles and fermion serving as
their building bricks? Can one identify CD as a carrier of topologically quantized classical ﬁelds
associated with a particle?
As already noticed the picture based on static CDs is too simplistic. This inspires several questions
relating to the possible dynamics of CDs.
1. In ZEO one can in principle imagine a creation of CD from and its disappearance to vacuum.
It is still unclear whether the space-time sheets associated with CD restricted to the interior of
CD or whether they can continue outside CD.
For the ﬁrst option appearance of CD would be a creation of sub-Universe contained by CD. CD
could be assigned with any sub-system. For the latter option the appearance of CD would be a
generation of spotlight of consciousness directing attention to a particular region of imbedding
space and thus to the portions of space-time surfaces inside it. Quantum superposition of space-
time surfaces is actually in question and should be determined before the presence of CD by
vacuum functional. How to describe possible creation and disappearance of CDs quantally, is
not clear. For instance, what is the amplitude for the appearance of a new CD from vacuum in
given quantum jump?
2. CDs have various moduli and one could assign to them quantum dynamics. The position of cm
or either tip of CD in M 4 deﬁnes moduli as does also the point of CP2 deﬁning the origin of
complex Eguchi-Hanson coordinates in which U(2) ⊂SU(3) acts linearly: these points are in
general assumed to be diﬀerent at the two ends of CD. If either tip of CD is ﬁxed the Lorentz
boost leaving the tip ﬁxed, moves the other along constant proper time hyperboloid H3 and
the tesselations deﬁned by the factor space H3/Γ, where Γ is discrete subgroup of SL(2, C), are
favored for number theoretical reasons.
Quantum classical correspondence inspires the question whether the boost is determined com-
pletely by the four-momentum assignable to the positive/negative energy part of zero energy
states and corresponds to the four-velocity β deﬁned by the ratio P/M of total four-momentum
and mass for the CD in question. It seems that this kind of assumption can be justiﬁed only in
semiclassical approximation.
3. In ZEO cm degrees of freedom of CD cannot carry Poincare charges. One can however assign the
Poincare charges of the positive energy part of zero energy state to a wave function depending
on the coordinate diﬀerences m12 deﬁning the relative coordinate for the tips of the CD.
The most general option is that the size scale of CD is continuous. This would allow to realize
momentum eigen state as the analogs of plane waves as a function of the position m12 of the
(say) upper tip of CD relative to the lower tip.
The size scale of CD has been however assumed to be quantized. That is, the temporal distance
T between the tips comes as an integer multiple of CP2 time TCP2: this scale is about 104 Planck
lengths so that this discretization has not practical consequences. Discretization is suggested
both by the number theoretical vision, the ﬁnite measurement resolution, and by the general
features of the U-matrix expressible as collection of M-matrices. Indeed in ZEO, one naturally
obtains an inﬁnite collection of U-matrices labelled by an integer, which would correspond to
the Lorentz invariant temporal distance Tn = nTCP2 between the tips. The scaling up of the
temporal distance would represent scaling of CD in the rest system deﬁned by the ﬁxed tip thus
translating the second tip with integer multiple of TCP2 from Tn1 to Tn2.
A further quantization would relate to the tesselations deﬁned by the subgroups Γ. The coun-
terparts of plane waves for the momentum eigenstates would be deﬁned in a discretized version

8.4. What arrow of time means at the level of quantum states
417
of Minkowski space obtained by dividing it to a sequence of discretized hyperboloids with proper
time distance a = nTCP2 from the lower tip of CD.
4. There is evidence that one can assign a CDs with a ﬁxed size scale to a given particle as secondary
p-adic length scale: for electron this size scale would correspond to Mersenne prime M127 and
frequency 10 Hz deﬁning a fundamental biorhythm. This would give a deep connection between
elementary particle physics and physics in macroscopic length scales. The integer multiples of
the secondary p-adic length size scale would correspond to integer values of the eﬀective Planck
constant.
A natural interpretation of this scale would be as infrared cutoﬀso that the wave functions
approximating momentum eigenstates and depending on the relative coordinate m12 would be
restricted in the region between light-cone boundary and hyperboloid a = M127T0.
Similar
restriction would take place for all elementary particles.
For particle with eﬀective Planck
constant ℏeff = nℏ0 the IR cutoﬀwould be n-multiple of that deﬁned by the secondary p-adic
time scale.
Could CDs allow to understand the simultaneous wave-particle nature of quantum states?
One of the paradoxical features of quantum theory is that we observe always particles - even with
well-deﬁned momentum - to have rather well-deﬁned spatial orbits. As if spatial localization would
occur in quantum measurements always and would be a key element of perception and state function
reduction process. This raises a heretic question: could it be possible that the localized particles
in some sense have a well-deﬁned momentum.
In standard quantum theory this is deﬁnitely not
possible. The assignment of CD with particle - or any physical system - however suggests that that
this paradoxical looking assignment is possible. Particle would be localized with respect to (say) the
lower tip of CD and delocalized with respect to (say) the upper tip and localization of the the lower
tip would imply delocalization of the upper tip.
It is indeed natural to assume that either tip of CD - say lower one - is localized in M 4 in state
function reduction. Unless one is willing to make additional assumptions, this implies not only the
non-prepared character of the state at the upper tip, but also a delocalization of the upper tip itself by
non-triviality of M-matrix: one has quantum superpositions of worlds characterized CDs with ﬁxed
lower tip. The localization at the lower tip would correspond to the fact that we experience the world
as classical. Each zero energy state would be prepared at the either (say lower) end of CD so that its
lower tip would have a ﬁxed position in M 4. The unprepared upper tip could have a wave function
in the space of all possible CDs with a ﬁxed lower tip.
One could also assign the spinor harmonics of M 4 × CP2 to the relative coordinates m12 and
their analogs in CP2 degrees of freedom. The notion of CD would therefore make possible to realize
simultaneously the paricle lbehavior in position space (localization of the lower tip of CD) and wave
like nature of the state (superposition of momentum eigenstates for the upper tip relative to the lower
tip).
This vision is only a heuristic guess. One should demonstrate that the average dynamical behavior
for coordinate diﬀerences m12 corresponds to that for a free particle with given four-momentum for a
given CD and ﬁxed quantum numbers for the positive energy part of the state.
The arrow of geometric time at the level of imbedding space and CDs
In the earlier argument the arrow of geometric time at imbedding space level was argued to relate
to the fact that zero energy states are prepared only at the either end of CD but not both. This is
certainly part of the story but something more concrete would be needed. In any case, the experienced
ﬂow of time should relate to what happens CDs but in the proposed model CDs are not aﬀected in
the quantum jump. Th is would leave only the drifting of sub-CDs as a mechanism generating the
arrow of geometric time at imbedding space level. It is however diﬃcult to concretize this option.
Could one understand the arrow of geometric time at imbedding space level as an increase of
the size of the size of CDs appearing in zero energy state? The moduli space of CDs with a ﬁxed
upper/lower tip is without discretization future/past light-cone. Therefore there is more room in the
future than in past for a particular CD and the situation is like diﬀusion in future light-cone meaning

418
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
that the temporal distance from the tip is bound to increase in statistical sense. This means gradual
scaling up of the size of the CD. A natural interpretation would be in terms of cosmological expansion.
There are two options to consider depending on whether the imbedding space is M 4×CP2 or M 4
+×
CP2. The latter option allows local Poincare symmetry and is consistent with standard Robertson-
Walker cosmology so that it cannot be excluded. The ﬁrst option leads to Russian doll cosmology
containing cosmologies within cosmologies in ZEO and is aesthetically more pleasing.
1. Consider ﬁrst the M 4 × CP2 option. At each tip of CD one has arrow of geometric time at
the level of imbedding space and these arrows are opposite. What does this mean? Do the
tips correspond to separate conscious entities becoming conscious alternately in state function
reductions? Or do they correspond to a single conscious entity with memories?
Could sleep awake cycle correspond to a sequence of state function reductions at opposite ends
of personal CD? It would seem that we are conscious (in the sense we understand consciousness)
only after state function reduction. Could we be conscious and have sensory percepts about the
other end of CD during sleep state but have no memories about this period so that we would be
living double life without knowing it? Does the unprepared and delocalized part (with respect
to m12) of zero energy state contribute to the conscious experience accompanying state function
reduction? Holography would suggest that this is not the case.
If CD corresponds to a spotlight of consciousness, the time span of conscious experience could
increase in both time directions for the latter option. The span of human collective consciousness
has been increasing in both direction all the time: we are already becoming conscious what has
probably happened immediately after the Big Bang. Could this evolution be completely universal
and coded to the fundamental physics?
2. If the imbedding space is assumed to be M 4
+ × CP2, one obtains only one arrow of time in the
long run. The reason is that the lower tip of any CD sooner or later reaches δM 4
+ × CP2 and
further expansion in this direction becomes impossible so that only the expansion of CD to the
future direction becomes possible.
Summary
The proposed vision for the dynamics of the moduli of CDs is rather general and allows a concrete un-
derstanding of the arrow of geometric time at imbedding space level and binds it directly to expansion
of CDs as analog of cosmic expansion. The previous vision about how the arrow of geometric time
could emerge at the level of space-time level remains essentially un-changed and allows the increase
of syntropy [J62] to be understood as the increase of entropy but for a non-standard correspondence
between the arrows of subjective time and the arrow of imbedding space time.
Imbedding space spinor harmonics characterizing the ground states of the representations of sym-
plectic group of δM 4
± ×CP2 deﬁne the counterparts of single particle wave functions assignable to the
relative coordinates of the second tip of CD with respect to the one ﬁxed in state function reduction.
The surprising outcome is the possibility to understand the paradoxical aspects of wave-particle du-
ality in terms of bi-local character of CD: localization of given tip implies delocalization of the other
tip.

Time for time
There are moments when any-one gets deeply frustrated to the situation in what one might call ”my
own ﬁeld”. For almost two decades ago this kind of deep frustration plus certain personal experiences
were the reasons why I started to work with quantum consciousness and quantum biology. For few
years ago my attention was directed again to particle physics and basic mathematical challenges of
TGD. The last year has been very intense since LHC and Fermilab and also some other experiments
have been feeding data directly relevant for TGD. The eﬀective neutrino superluminality was a pleasant
surprise which might eventually force even the most bullish colleagues to accept TGD if they want to
continue doing funded physics.
The rather recent events - here I mean the really weird censoship in Science2.0 using various dirty
tricks that one might expect only a 12 year old computer nerd to use - have however re-created the

8.5. Time for time
419
frustrated feelings again. Is it really true that people calling themselves theoretical physicist are not
able to do anything else than rehashing theories which have been dead for decades? Just a look at
hep-th in arXiv.org makes me depressed. I can only wonder in what is the world these fellows are
living in. Even worse, some colleagues seem to spend their time to silly sensoring tricks in blogs! It is
really frustrating to see how low the intellectual standards in particle physics theory nowadays are.
For these reasons I was very happy when I discovered that Sean Carroll in Cosmic Variance gave
links to really interesting talks in Time conference arranged by fQXI. I have not been too happy for
the elitistic nature of these conferences making impossible the communication of really new theoretical
ideas. By listening the brilliant talk [J53] by neuroscientist David Eagleman, I however learned that
this conference made possible communication of extremely interesting experimental ﬁndings about the
relation of the time of physicist to the subjective time. I sincerely hope that my colleagues would listen
this talk and realize that there are fascinating problems to be solved. There is simply no theory and
therefore no list of dead theories among which graduate student is allowed to choose as in theoretical
physics.
Eagleman together with other neuro scientists make distinction between time and subjective time
and the experimental work has revealed that this relationship looks very complex and is poorly
understood. One of the key realizations forced by TGD inspired theory of consciousness - in a well-
deﬁned sense a generalization of quantum measurement theory - is that geometric time (the time of
ﬁeld equations) and subjective time (experienced time) are two diﬀerentnotions. The challenge is to
understand how they relate and under what conditions and in what approximation their identiﬁcation
performed routinely my the naive colleagues is possible. This was an excellent reason for continuing
listening and I warmly recommend this for the reader.
Also the other lectures might be equally
rewarding. In the following I just represent TGD based interpretation of the ﬁndings and suggest that
the reader would not take it too seriously and would try to build his or her own interpretation.
Eagleman talks about what he calls relativity of subjective time. This has of course nothing to do
with the relativity of the geometric time. At the basic level subjective time need not even allow any
metric measure (as is the case in TGD where subjective time corresponds to a sequence of quantum
jumps).
8.5.1
Flash-lag eﬀect and its modiﬁcation
Eagleman tells ﬁrst about very simple visual illusion known as ﬂash-lag eﬀect. One rotates a small
circle around a circular orbit. As the circle passes the horizontal line there is a ﬂash of light in the
middle of the circle. If our perception were ideal the ﬂash would be perceived in the middle of the
circle. The circle is perceived to be 5 degrees ahead of the ﬂash.
The ﬁrst explanation to come in mind is that brain anticipates the motion of the ﬂash and represent
it to us in a position in which it would be in nearby future. Eagleman decided to test this proposal and
studied three diﬀerent situations. Two of them correspond to a circle rotating in opposite directions
and the third one to a situation in which the circle stops at the position of the ﬂash. The theory
predicts that the circle is perceived to be ahead in all situations since the perveiver should not know
anything about what happens in future. The surprise was that there was no ﬂash-lag when the circle
stopped. As if the brain would know what happens in the nearby future.
This kind of observation is not new. I remember more than a decade old experiment studing
the galvanic response created by emotionally very provocative picture appearing as an odd-ball in a
series of neutral pictures. This kind of response was observed. The mystery was that it was observed
before the picture was seen! The result was of course not taken seriously by serious scientists. When
a serious scientist associates something with the word ”parapsychology” he loses totally ability to
rational thinking and begins to rage.
The conclusion is that our moment of subjective time seems to have a ﬁnite duration about 80 ms
and all events that occur in this time interval are associated with one and same moment of subjective
time. This time interval would correspond to 12.5 Hz frequency. In TGD framework the interpretation
could be in terms of the time scale assignable to causal diamond (CD) identiﬁed as intersection of
future and past directed light-cones, which serves as imbedding space-correlate for the moment of
consciousness: this time would be the temporal distance between the tips of CD.
The fractal hierarchy of quantum jumps within quantum jumps (identiﬁable as with a hierarchy
of selves withing selves) has the hierarchy of CDs as an imbedding space correlate. For electron the
time scale of CD is 100 seconds. What is troubling is that 80 ms corresponds to a time interval which

420
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
is by 20 per cent shorter. One could of course assign this time scale to some cyclotron frequency in
TGD framework but I would be very happy if it would correspond to a time duration of electron’s
CD.
As Eagleman tells, perception involves gaps. For instance, during saccadic motion necessary for
visual consciousness (the explanation in TGD framework is that the conscious experience is associated
with nondeterministic change, quantum jump) visual system is not on. We do not however perceive
these gaps although we perceive the gaps created by putting lights oﬀ. Could it be that the gaps
are absent because the 100 ms CDs in the sequences have overlap producing on the average 80 ms
intervals without overlap? Could the absence of gaps also tell us that it is retina and various sensory
organs which build the fundamental qualia and that brain only constructs a cognitive representation
about it decomposing the world to objects with certain properties and names and also builds all
kinds of useful associations? This picture applies to all sensory qualia in TGD Universe and one can
circumvent various objections against it in terms of TGD view about time.
8.5.2
We live in the past: but in what sense?
One surprisingfact about consciousness is that we live in the past. The justiﬁcation for this in terms of
standard neuroscience, where brain builds both sensory and cognitive representations of the external
world, does not require reﬁned arguments.
Neural communications are extremely slow using light-velocity as the standard. The velocities of
nerve pulses are between 1-100 m/s as compared with the light velocity 3 × 108 m/s. The communi-
cation of the sensory data to brain takes time which can be of order second. The data coming from
various sensory organs with varying velocities must be processed and combined to single view about
external world at associative cortex. This takes time since it is the slowest signalst that determine
the time used for the processing. Eagleman gives a humorous example: tall people should live father
in past than the short ones since it takes longer time for neural signals from feet to arrive from cortex
to the brain! Diﬀerent sensory inputs must be also combined together in a realistic manner.
Is the brain really able to meet this enormous challenge? The representation about the external
world is not enough: this representation must be also realistic and 80 ms seems to represent the
maximum duration of moment of sensory consciousness. Is the velocity of nerve pulses quite too slow
to achieve this? And is information processing based on nerve pulse conduction really fast enough?
1. These questions could have been motivation for TGD proposal (or almost-prediction) that sen-
sory organs are seats of primary sensory qualia experienced instantanously.
2. They could have also motivated what proposal that quantum entanglement is needed to bind
various parts of the body and brain to form single coherent conscious unit. Quantum entan-
glement makes possible eﬀective signalling with inﬁnite velocity. Of course, genuine signals are
not in question. It is better to speak about macroscopic system behaving like an elementary
particle. Dark matter realized as a hierarchy of macroscopic quantum phases with a larger value
of Planck constant is what would make this possible.
3. Light velocity is ideal for the communication purposes in the scale of biological body. Could
it be that biology might have been stupid enough to miss this kind of an opportunity? Could
it be that neuroscientists are the stupid one and simply on a wrong track? In TGD inspired
model dark photons with large value of ℏ(bio-photons would be dark photons transformed to
ordinary photons) deﬁne a central element both in the communications from sensory organs to
brain and to magnetic body and from magnetic body to biological body. At the level of body
the communications would be practically instantaneous.
4. Even in Earth length scale the time taken by EEG photons to travel from biological body to
the corresponding layear of the magnetic body would still be be of order .1 seconds and the
experiments of Libet demonstrate among other things that our sensory data is a fraction of
second old. This has nothing to do with the conduction velocity of nerve pulses. The purpose of
nerve pulses would be quite diﬀerent: they would create fundamental memory representations
and the model for this is based on DNA as topological quantum computer vision.
Explaining this would however require TGD based view about memory as 4-D perception: causal
diamonds are 4-D objects and our conscious experience is always about 4-D space-time region.

8.5. Time for time
421
For sensory perception the scale of this region is .1 seconds. For the perceptions that we call
memories the scale is often years or even decades. Our conscious experience is 4-dimensional.
Also our motor actions are essentially 4-dimensional: moment of consciousness replaces 4-D
world (or quantum superpositions of them) with a new one: also our geometric past is changed
in every moment of consciousness. This view resolves many puzzles related to memory but time
is far from mature for the revolution. My hope is that the talks of Time conference could open
the minds of at least some young colleagues.
5. The communications with light velocity make possible feedback from brain to sensory organs
making possible the building of standardized mental images by using the virtual sensory input
from brain to create a charicature. Our brain would be an artist using primary sensory input
as a raw material.
8.5.3
Kublai Khan’s problem and three more surprises
Eagleman tells about the problem of emperor Kublai Khan. At that time people did not have internet
and being a head of an empire of the size of Asia posed many problems. Kublai Khan used emissars
travelling around the empire and bringing news about what happened. The problems was the correct
integration of these data: the news about ending of some local war somewhere could arrive before the
news telling that it had begun! Brain is faced with a similar problem. When the television came, one
of the big problems was thought to be the synchronization of pictures and sound. It however turned
out that brain takes care of this problem if the picture and sound to be associated with each other
are withing 80 milliseconds. The moment of subjective time has this duration.
That we live in past was the ﬁrst surprise of neuroscience already discussed. Eagleman tells about
three more big surprises of neuroscience.
Time perception recalibrates
The brain must build a logical story about sensory data coming through diﬀerent sensory channels.
To achieve this time perception recalibrates. When one comes from bright sunlight to a dim room,
the response function of retina gets slower. This does not however happen at the level of conscious
experience. A simple test is a sequence of button clicks causing a ﬂash of light. Experimenter can
cheat the subject person by producing the light ﬂash with a delay. Surprisingly, the subject person
notices nothing. What is even more surprising that when one adds to the sequence of click-ﬂash pairs
an odd-ball for which ﬂash is not delayed, the ﬂash is experienced to take place earlier than clicking!
Again a direct evidence for the TGD prediction that our perceptive ﬁeld is 4-dimensional.
In this kind of situation the natural conclusion of subject person would be that it was not me who
did the click. Some other agent caused the ﬂash whereas my own attempt fails. Eagleman suggests
that schizophrenia might be a disorder of time perception. Person would attribute his own thoughs
sometimes heard as internal voices to some external subjects since the time order is pathological.
Maybe.
What is known that schizophrenics have very sharp sensory perception which cannot be
cheated and that there might be no re-calibration. Eagleman talks about temporal inﬂexibility. This
is of course just a suggestion as Eagleman emphasizes.
I am not enthusiastic about this kind of
interpretation: the bicameral views of Jaynes ﬁt much better with the idea that magnetic body uses
biological body as sensory receptor and motor instrument.
Time is not one thing
Time perception is much more complex than one might think: it involves many aspects such as
duration, simultanety, ﬂicker rate, time ordering.
What brain does is the analysis of the sensory
imput, and its reconstruction from the resulting small pieces. This is very much what is done in the
processing of the raw sound (and also pictures) in movies. This applies also to time perception. In
TGD framework also the feedback from brain is essential and basic communications would take place
using light. Nerve pulse patterns would serve quite diﬀerent purpose and are also hopelessly slow for
building the percept.

422
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
The rate of time ﬂow correlates with the rate of neural metabolism
There is large number of ﬁndings supporting the few that the experienced rate for the ﬂow of subjective
time correlates with the rate of neural metabolism and therefore with the intensity of consciousness.
1. Slowing down of the subjective time
Slowing down of subjective time ﬂow is familiar to anyone.
This can happen in troublesome
situation or in so called ﬂow state. Interestingly, also in very boring situations (say waiting for some-
one to come) the same can happen. From my own experience I would say that the slowing down of
subjective time characterizes very intense conscious experiences involving intense concentration. But
why it would occur when you are bored: perhaps just because you are so intensely conscious about
how boring your life is just now. You are not drowsy: you are inpatient and irritated.
Various explanations have been proposed. The proposal that the slowing down of time is analogous
to the slowing down of the magnetic tape reducing the frequencies of sounds fails. Another explanation
could be in terms of increased time resolution and also I have proposed this explanation.
This
explanation was tested.
Eagleman did an experiment which could be also seen as a tongue-in-cheek variant of Galileo’s
famous experiment in which he dropped various objects from the tower or Pisa and measured the time
of fall and observed that it does not depend on the weight of the material object. Eagleman dropped
subject persons instead of stones!
First of all Eagleman constructed an instrument which he calls perceptive chronometer producing
random sequence of digits. In the simplest situation only single digit appeared alternatively as its
positive or negative. As the rate of digits exceeds certain critical rate -presumably rather near to 12.5
Hz under normal circumstances- it becomes impossible to distinguish between subsequent digits: one
sees only single fuzzy digit. The critical duration for the digit deﬁnes a natural unit of subjective
time. The idea is to calibrate the rate of the chronometer in such a manner that the subject person
is not able to distinguish between digits but that only a small reduction of the digit rate makes this
possible. In this kind of situation it is enough to make the person scared and see whether he becomes
able to distinguish between subsequent digits.
What Eagleman wanted to test was whether this time resolution increases when a person is really
scared. If so, the subjective time measured using this critical unit would be longer in scaring situations.
The method of really scaring was ingenious: drop the person from quite high a tower! During the free
fall the person ﬁrst found the critical time resolution of his visual perception which became the time
unit used to measure the time of fall. The rate for Person reported his time resolution in two cases:
when another person was falling and during own fall. The resolution increased during own fall: the
falling time was estimated to be about 36 per cent longer for own falling down using the resolution as
a unit.
What does this mean? It seems that the rate of the experienced time ﬂow depends on the level
of neural activity. In TGD framework the proper measure of subjective time is single quantum jump
(recall that they form fractal hierarchy): this would be the tick of subjective clock. The larger the
number of these ticks in a given interval of geometric time, the longer the experienced time duration
is. More abstractly: the number of sub-CDs within CD representing mental images of self would
provide a measure for the number of ticks during single CD.
Since metabolic energy is the necessary prerequite for the build-up of sensory and cognitive rep-
resentations (mental images), the prediction is that the rate with which metabolic energy is used by
brain correlates directly with the rate of the experienced time ﬂow. When the subject person is falling
from a tower, the rate of brain metabolism is higher than normally so that the observations can be
understood in terms of the theory. As a matter fact, the correlation of the subjective duration with
neural activity is well-known in neuroscience and Eagleman gives a long list of examples.
2. Odd ball eﬀect
In this experiment the subject person perceives a series of ﬁgures. The ﬁgures are identical apart
from some odd-balls between the repeating ones. The duration of odd-ball is experienced to be longer
than that of the repeating picture although it is the same. The explanation would be that brain wants
to save energy. Less metabolic energy for repeating items and nore metabolic energy for odd-balls,
which literally wake-up the partially sleeping brain. The rate of neural metabolism correlating with the
intensity of conscious experience (and number of quantum jumps per unit of geometric time/density

8.6. Updates since 2012
423
of sub-CD:s within CD) seems to correlated directly with the experienced slowing down of time.
To sum up, the ﬁndings discussed by Eagleman are not easy to understand in the standard con-
ceptual framework of neuroscience. The basic assumptions of TGD inspired theory of consciousness
make the explanation trivial. In particular, the hierarchy of quantum jumps containing quantum
jumps (of selves having sub-selves with subselves interpreted as mental images of self) and having as
an imbedding space correlate the hierarchy of CDs within CDs, explains the correlation of neural
metabolic energy consumption with the experienced rate for the ﬂow of subjective time. The higher
the density of sub-CDs within CD representing mental images, the higher the intensity of conscious
experience,the higher the consumption of metabolic energy to build mental images, and the shorter
the average time interval taken by given mental image and serving as a natural unit of subjective time
and the longer the experienced duration of time interval.
8.6
Updates since 2012
A considerable progress has occurred in the understanding of TGD inspired theory of consciousness
during the ﬁrst half of 2013. I have not however included all material about this progress since other
chapters of ”TGD Inspired theory of consciousness” already contain the relevant material. A detailed
representation of the recent vision about TGD inspired theory of consciousness [K97] is recommended
for the reader interested in details and various philosophical problems and their solutions in TGD
framework.
The basic new result is that NMP applies only in the rational intersection of realities and p-adicities.
The new results are discussed at the end of the chapter ”Negentropy Maximization Principle” [K44].
The hypothesis that state function reduction means measurement of the density matrix implies that
quantum criticality as degeneracy of eigenvalues of the density matrix and NMP in the intersection
ﬁxes the p-adic prime associated with the criticality.
Also a close connection between quantum
criticality, vision about life as something in the intersection of realities and p-adicities, hierarchy
of eﬀective vales of Planck constant, negentropic entanglement, and p-adic cognition emerges. That
various speculative ideas about TGD integrate to single coherent structure, is certainly an encouraging
sign.
The more detailed view about structure of quantum jump in ZEO allows to see the state function
reductions to the opposite boundaries of causal diamond (CD) deﬁning the geometric correlate for
”spot light of consciousness” as sensory perception and motor action. Motor action can be seen as
time reversed sensory perception. This symmetry is very profound and strong prediction and forces
to modify dramatically the beliefs about the arrow of geometric time and its relation to the subjective
arrow of time. A subsection about sensory-motor duality is included since it is fundamental for the
new view about time. Also the question how the experienced continuous ﬂow of consciousness can be
consistent with its identiﬁcation with a sequence of quantum jumps is fundamental and is discussed
from p-adic point of view in what follows.
8.6.1
The roles of sensory perception and motor action in TGD framework
The attempts to deﬁne consciousness rely on two basic approaches. The ﬁrst approach emphasizes
direct sensory awareness and formation of cognitive representations from it (phenomal consciousness
and reﬂective consciousness). Second approach emphasizes volition, motor plans, and motor actions.
The analogs of sensory representations and motor actions emerge at the fundamental level in
quantum TGD without mentioning anything about brain. In ZEO state function reduction is replaced
with a cascade of state function reductions corresponding to various scales for CDs forming a fractal
hierarchy. State function reduction can take place to either of the opposite boundaries of CD in a
given length scale. The reduction at given boundary of CD would always force delocalization of the
opposite boundary of CD creating quantum superposition of CDs with various sizes. Also new sub-
CDs (correlates for sensory mental images) within the resulting bigger CDs are naturally generated.
This would explain the arrow of geometric time at imbedding space level but the arrows are opposite
at the opposite boundaries of CD.
The reduction to opposite boundaries of CD gives rise to zero energy states related by time reversal
at the level of imbedding space. If ”my” conscious experience corresponds to reductions to either
”upper” or ”lower” boundary of CD of wake-up cycle deﬁning me, I will experience that the arrow of

424
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
geometric at the level of imbedding space arrow is constant and would be basically due to the scaling
up of the average size of ”personal” CD. ”Upper”/”lower” can be ﬁxed by the arrow of time assignable
to large enough CD deﬁnining environment.
Standard quantum measurement theory assumes that a state function reduction followed imme-
diately by a new one does not aﬀect the reduced state [this gives rise to so called quantum Zeno
eﬀect: quantum monitoring of unstable particle prevents its decay (watched kettle does not boil)].
That repeated state function reduction at given boundary of CD does not aﬀect the zero energy state
resulting in the reduction for given CD would generalize this hypothesis. If this assumption hold true,
the subsequent reductions at the same boundary of CD would eﬀectively correspond to single reduc-
tion and one would eﬀectively have an alternating sequence of cascades of state function reductions
beginning from opposite boundaries of CDs. Note hower that there a fractal cascade of reductions
beginning from sub-CDs the CD is assumed changing the state in smaller scales.
In TGD framework the counterpart of quantum Zeno eﬀect would be achieved by closing an
unstable particle inside small enough CD so that the unitary time evolution restricted to CD would
not aﬀect the particle appreciably and state function reductions at boundaries of this CD very rarely
would give rise to a ﬁnal state of decay. Watchdog in this case would be the self to which this CD
corresponds to.
Motor action as time reversal of sensory perception
In TGD framework motor action could be seen as a time reversal of sensory perception so that sensory-
motor pairing could be seen as fundamental element of all conscious existence. Just to ﬁx conventions
let us ﬁx arrow of time as the arrow of the imbedding space time for a very large CD, maybe of cosmic
size scale, so that there is unique time direction corresponding to future.
1. All scales for CDs are possible. For sub-CDs of given CD the experiences associated with sub-
CD deﬁne mental images of CD and the experience can be assigned with either boundary of
sub-CD. Let us tentatively agree that for a given CD ”lower” and ”upper” boundaries are in
future and past when seen from the center point of CD (past and future could be permuted in
the convention).
This choice would conform with the interpretation that motor ”me” Im makes a fuzzy prediction
of future as superposition of space-time sheets extending from the lower boundary of CD and
sensory ”me” Is generates memories represented by superposition of space-time sheets extending
downwards from the upper boundary of CD. I do not quite have the courage to completely
exclude the second option in which the roles of motor me and sensory me are changed.
2. With this assumption one can assign to a sub-CD near upper resp. lower boundary of sub-
CD sensory mental images resp.
their time reversals.
In the interior they would represent
memories resp. predictions. The larger CD would experience these subselves as mental images
and interpret them in terms of ordinary sensory percepts resp. volitions, decisions, and plans.
The primary sensory experience, phenomenal experience, involves generation of negentropic
entanglement as the sensory mental image combines as a tensor factor with the existing sequence
of mental images forming a sensory representation deﬁning memory. The reading of this sequence
of mental images using interaction free quantum measurement gives rise to a conscious memory
about the mental image sequence.
3. A prediction, which looks rather strange at ﬁrst glance, follows. ”My” CD would be seat for
two selves having their own phenomenal experiences seated at the opposite boundaries of my
CD. They would be sensory me Is assignable to sensory perception and motor me Im assignable
to motor action as time reversed sensory perception and assignable to the opposite boundaries
of CD when they are localized in state function reduction. The time reversed sensory percept is
interpreted in terms of predictions, volitons, and plans at least by larger CD having the CD as
sub-CD. Sensory and motor ”mes” would appear in all scales in the hierarchy of sub-CDs.
4. Since the scale of CDs increases quantum jump by quantum jump on the average and new sub-
CDs emerge, the size scale of the largest CD in hierarchy increases and the perceptual ﬁelds of
the two ”me”s associated with it shift towards geometric future resp. past of the imbedding
space. The sub-CDs near the boundaries of largest CD give rise to sensory percepts of the two

”me”s involved with the largest CD in the hierarchy. Those in the interior deﬁne memories. The
ﬂow of time would correspond to the gradual shifting of the upper/lower boundary of largest
CD to future/past and generation of sensory mental images (sub-CDs) near the boundary. Same
would of course occur for the smaller CDs. The time interval about which memories are about
and also the time scale for predictions of future increases since the size of the personal CD is
gradually scaled up.
Quantitative considerations
One can make also quantitative questions.
1. What is the average increase of the temporal distance between the tips of CD in a pair of state
function reductions to opposite boundaries deﬁning the chronon of subjective experience? The
duration of this chronon can depend on the level of the self hierarchy.
For human sensory consciousness this chronon would naturally correspond to the time scale of
about .1 seconds having interpretation as a duration of sensory mental image. Each pair of state
function reductions would generate a layer of the sensory mental images at the lower and upper
boundary of ”our” CD.
This leaves open the size scale of ”our” CD and lifetime would represent only the size scale for
the increase of ”our” CD during life cycle. This would mean that the durations of consciousness
for the two ”me”s assignable to ”our” CD would be measured using .1 second as a natural unit.
2. What can one say about the size scales of CDs themselves? Since the memories are about the
time interval, which is roughly the duration of life cycle at most, the ﬁrst guess is that the size
of personal CD is of the order of duration of life cycle. By the previous argument however only
the increase of the distance between the tips of ”personal” CD naturally corresponds to the
duration of life cycle so that the size scale of personal CD could be much larger. Note that
the conscious experiences of Is and Im assignable to sensory percepts and motor actions should
correspond to sub-CD:s with size scale not much larger than .1 seconds. This is consistent with
the interpretation of sensory percepts of Im as plans, decisions, predictions, and volitions. The
sub-CDs with time scale of say years are however possible and would correspond to memories
and plans in time scales of years.
3. One can imagine also a fractal hierarchy for the increments ∆Ti of the temporal distance Ti
between tips of CDs assignable to single pair of quantum jumps to opposite boundaries of CD in
given length scale. ∆T = .1 seconds would not be the only possible duration of chronon. This
time scale is however very special since it corresponds to the Mersenne prime M127 assignable to
electron which corresponds to largest Mersenne prime which does not correspond to completely
super-astrophysical p-adic length scale. The smaller Mersenne primes - such as M107 and M89
could correspond to shorter time scales perhaps assignable to nerve pulse in the case of lightest
quarks. All primes characterizing elementary particles could deﬁne chronons of this kind serving
as clocks. The hierarchy of chronons could mean sensory percepts and motor actions have a
fractal hierachy of resolutions identiﬁable as kind of abstraction hierarchy.
The clocks deﬁned by these chronons of duration Ti should be synchronized in the sense that
there would Nij = ∆Ti/∆Tj quantum jumps with time increment Tj per single quantum jump
with time increment Ti.
Could various periodic phenomena such as diurnal period of 24 hours deﬁning sleep-awake cycle,
annual cycle, and various bio-rhytms such as EEG rhytms, deﬁne also chronons? Could cyclity
which seems to appear at the level of sensory and cognitive mental images relate to this kind of
chronons: for instance, after images are a good example about mental images having analog of
wake-up-sleep cycle.
Questions
There are also questions about the relation to the functioning of brain.

426
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
1. How sleep-awake cycle relates to this picture? The above argument suggest that .1 second time
scale rather than 24 hour time scale deﬁnes the increase of CD scale assignable to single pair of
state function reduction assignable to ”me”. Therefore the period assignable to single moment
of human sensory conscious of the two ”me”s would be of order .1 seconds.
This strongly suggests that due to the lack of sensory input and absence of motor actions we
are conscious during sleep but do not have memories from this period. Dreams generated by
virtual sensory input to retina would produce memories during sleep state. Revonsuo indeed
mentions that according to the reports of subject persons after awakenings sleeping period seems
to involve either dreams or sleep mentation. Sleep mentation is very simple during nREM sleep:
for instance, repetion of some word of internal speech. Sleep mentation would involve motor
actions generating internal speech and in some cases also genuine speech. Also genuine motor
actions such as sleep walking are possible.
2. Could the sensory-motor dichotomy have some relation to the righ-left dichotomy at the level of
brain? Right and left brain hemisphere could naturally correspond to parallel CDs of same size
scale. Could right and left brain (or parts of them) organize their wake-up periods as in shift
work: if left brain hemisphere is awake right hemisphere sleeps (sensorily perceives the opposite
end of its CD) and vice versa, an alternating dominance by either hemisphere results, and one
could understand sensory rivalry. The time scale of CDs possibly involved would be much shorter
than that of sleep-awake cycle in this case. Interestingly, the duration of hemisphere dominance
period in some disorders like schizophrenia is anomalously long.
The CD containing both these CDs - ”entire brain CD” - would be also present. The view
of ”brain CD” about world represented by entangled right and left negentropic mental images
would be analogous to initial and ﬁnal state and thus contain much more information than given
by either right or left hemisphere. In the case of visual mental images this would give rise to
stereo vision.
Could this shift work between parts of right and left hemisphere be realized in several time scales
of CDs? Even in the scale corresponding to sleep-awake rhythm? It is known that in case of
some birds and mammals, which must be motorially and sensorily active all the time, the brain
hemispheres have this kind of shift work in long time scale.
8.6.2
Trying to understand the relationship between subjective and geo-
metric time
I am trying to improve my understanding about the relationship between subjective and geometric
time. Subjective time corresponds to a sequence of quantum jumps at given level of hierarchy of selves
having as correlates causal diamonds (CDs). Geometric time is fourth space-time coordinate and has
real and p-adic variants. This raises several questions.
1. How the subjective times at various levels of hierarchy relate to each other? Should/could one
somehow map sequences of quantum jumps at various levels to real or p-adic time values in
order to compare them - as quantum classical correspondence indeed suggests?
2. Subjective existence corresponds to a sequence of moments of consciousness: state function
reductions at opposite boundaries of CDs. State function reduction reduction localizes either
boundary but the the second boundary is in a quantum superposition of several locations and
size scales for CD. We however experience time as a continuous ﬂow.
Is this a problem or
not? One could argue that it is not possible to be conscious about being unconscious so that
gaps would not be experienced. But is this so simple? We are indeed able to experience the
gap in sensory consciousness caused by sleeping over night (this does not mean we have been
unconscious: we just do not remember).
3. Subjective time is certainly not metricizable whereas geometric time is and deﬁnes a continuum.
But are moments of consciousness well-ordered as the values of real variant of geometric time
are? This relates closely to the relationship of subjective time to geometric time. Certainly
subjective time does not allow any continuous measure in real sense as geometric time does.
One can however map moments of consciousness to integers.

8.6. Updates since 2012
427
(a) It would seem natural to be able to say about two moments of consciousness - call them
A and B, - whether A is before B or vice versa.
Moments of consciousness would be
well-ordered and could be mapped to real integers. But is this the case always? There
is experimental evidence for the fact that consciously experience time ordering does not
always correspond to the physical one. This was observed already by Libet (see my ﬁrst
attempt to understand these ﬁndings [K86]).
(b) What about p-adic integers as labels for moments of consciousness as suggested by the
vision about p-adic space-time sheets as correlates for cognition and intention (as time
reversal of cognition). Given p-adic integers m and n, one can only say whether the p-adic
norm of m is larger than, smaller than, or equal to that of n. One can say that p-adic
integers are weakly ordered.
p-Adic integers form a continuum in p-adic topology. Could one map the inﬁnite sequence of
quantum jumps already occurred to p-adic integers and in this manner to p-adic continuum instead
of real one? Could the p-adic cognitive representations allow to achieve this? If so, the experience
about conscious ﬂow of time could be due to the p-adic topology for cognitive representation for the
sequence of quantum jumps!
Could p-adic integers label moments of consciousness and explain why we experience
conscious ﬂow of time?
Next arguments give a more precise formulation for the idea that p-adic integers might label the
sequence of quantum jumps at the level of conscious experience, or rather reﬂective consciousness
involving various representations realized as ”Akashic records” and read consciously by interaction
free measurements (assuming that they make sense in TGD: NMP considerably modiﬁes the standard
quantum measurement theory).
1. Most p-adic integers expressible as n = P
k nkpk are inﬁnite in real sense and in p-adic topology
they form a continuum. Suppose that the inﬁnite sequence of moments of consciousness that
have already taken place can be labelled by p-adic integers and look what might be the outcome.
2. Sounds very strange in ears of real analyst but is true: the integers n and n + kpN, for N large
are very near to each other p-adically. In real sense they are very far. This allows to ﬁll the
gaps between say integers n = 1 and 2 by p-adic integers which are very large in real sense.
3. The p-adic correlate of the sequence of discrete quantum jumps/moments of consciousness would
deﬁne p-adic continuum which in turn can be mapped to real continuum by canonical identiﬁ-
cation.
This map sequence of moments of consciousness to p-adic continuum would be nice but maybe
tricky for any-one accustomed to think in terms of real topology!
This raises two questions.
1. p-Adic integers are not well-ordered. Could one induced the well-ordering of real time to p-adic
context by mapping p-adic time axis to real one in a continuous manner and in this manner
achieving mapping of moments of consciousness to real time axis?
2. Could canonical identiﬁcation P
k nkpk →P
k nkp−k map (or its appropriate modiﬁcation) allow
to map p-adic integers to real numbers and in this manner induce real well ordering to the p-adic
side. The problem is that real number with ﬁnite pinary expansion has second inﬁnite expansion
(1=.9999... is example using decimal expansion) so that two p-adic time values correspond to any
real time value with ﬁnite pinary digits. Should one restrict the consideration to integers with
ﬁnite number of pinary digits (ﬁnite measurement resolution) and select either branch? Could
the two branches correspond to real time coordinates assignable to the opposite boundaries of
CD deﬁning two conscious selves in this scale?

428
Chapter 8. About the Nature of Time
What happens when I type letters in wrong order?
One can speak about sensory and cognitive orderings of events corresponding to reals and p-adics
(for various values prime p or course). The cognitive ordering of events would not be well-ordering if
cognition is p-adic. Is there any empirical support for this besides Libet’s mysterious looking ﬁndings?
Maybe. For instance, as I am typing text I experience that I am typing the letters of the word in
the correct order but now and then it happens that the order is changed, even the order of syllables
and sometimes even that of short words can change. It is probably easy to cook up a very mundane
explanation in terms of neuroscience or even electric circuits from keyboard to computer memory, or
computer itself. One can however also ask whether this could reﬂect the fact that p-adic ordering of
the intentions to type letter is not well-ordering and does not always correspond to the real number
based order for what happened ?
In TGD Universe writing process involves a sequence of transformations of p-adically realized
intention to type a letter to a real action (doing it). At space-time level it is therefore a map from
p-adic realm to real realm by a variant of canonical identiﬁcation crucial in the deﬁnition of p-adic
manifold concept assigning to real preferred extremal of K¨ahler action a p-adic preferred extremal in
ﬁnite measurement resolution [K98]).
The variant of canonical identiﬁcation in question deﬁnes chart maps from real to p-adic realm and
vice versa, and is deﬁned in such a manner that discrete and rationals in a ﬁnite subset of rationals
are mapped to themselves and deﬁning intersection of real and p-adic realms.
1. In the case of p-adic integers this subset is characterized by a cutoﬀtelling the power of p below
which p-adic integers and real integers correspond to each other as such. For the corresponding
moments of consciousness (now intentions to type letter) one has same ordering in both realms.
For integers containing higher powers of p a variant of canonical identiﬁcation mapping p-adics
to reals continuously is applied. In this case ordering anomalies can appear.
2. Another pinary cutoﬀcomes from physics: real preferred extremals are mapped to p-adic pre-
ferred extremals and vice versa: without the cutoﬀthe p-adic image of real extremal would be
continuous but non-diﬀerentiable so that ﬁeld equations would not make sense. The cutoﬀtells
the largest power of p up to which the variant of canonical identiﬁcation is performed for p-adic
integers. Also now ordering anomalies appear if one regards p-adic integers as ordinary integers.
3. For the remaining integers the map is obtained by completing the discrete set of points to a
preferred extremal of K¨ahler action on both real and p-adic sides so that physics enters into the
game. This assignment need not be unique and the most natural manner to handle the non-
uniqueness is to form quantum superposition of all allowed completions with same amplitude:
this eﬀective gauge invariance would be very natural from the point of view of ﬁnite resolution
and conforms with the vision about inclusions of hyper-ﬁnite factors as a representation for ﬁnite
measurement resolution giving rise to the analog of dynamical gauge symmetry [K92].
Could the strange inconsistencies between cognitive (sequences of intentions) and sensory time
orderings (sequence of typed letters) reﬂect the fact that the ordering of p-adic integers as real integers
is not the same as the ordering of their real images under canonical identiﬁcation? Could it be possible
to test this and perhaps deduce the prime p characterizing p-adic topology of cognitive representation
in question?

Chapter 9
Conscious Information and
Intelligence
9.1
Introduction
This chapter is a fusion of two separate chapters, the ﬁrst one devoted to information measures for
conscious experience and second summarizing a quantum model for intelligent systems. This reﬂects
in its own way the fact that the development of the related ideas has not been a linear process and
has involved many weird twists typical for a mathematical thinking without strong connection with
empiria.
The motivation for the recent updating are the developments in basic quantum TGD occurred
during last ﬁve years (I am writing this towards the end of March, 2010). In the following I shall
summarize TGD inspired view about information, intelligence and consciousness. Some of the memes
of the previous version written around 2003 have lost the game and new memes - or rather an overall
vision about conscious intelligence- has emerged.
9.1.1
Magnetic body as intentional agent and experiencer
The notion of magnetic body has a central role in TGD inspired biology. Magnetic body has an
onionl ike fractal structure and astrophysical size with wavelength of EEG wave deﬁning the size
scale of the magnetic body with which it is associated.
Magnetic body acts as as an intentional
agent using biological body as a motor instrument and sensory receptor. Magnetic body receives
sensory and other information from biological body through EEG and its fractal counterparts and
controls biological body via EEG type signals sent to the genome, where they induce chemical or
electromagnetic gene expression. This allows to imagine also a mechanism of collective learning. The
spatio-temporal nerve pulse patterns deﬁning topological quantum computations are mediated via
EEG and its fractal counterparts to the magnetic body of organism and from it to the magnetic body
of another organism [K21] .
The magnetic body of Earth - magnetic Mother Gaia- could serve as a relay station and Schumann
resonances and alpha band could allow broadcasting of the nerve pulse pattern to a large number of
magnetic bodies of organisms. From the latter magnetic body the ﬁeld representation of nerve pulse
pattern would induce via EEG type signal from magnetic body to the receiver genome the original
nerve pulse pattern in the brain of the receiver. Nerve pulse patterns would be quite generally induced
by magnetic bodies via appropriate part of the intronic genome as electromagnetic gene expression.
This mechanism could be also involved with telepathy and remote mental interactions.
Magnetic ﬂux tubes and ﬂux sheets are basic building bricks of the magnetic body and DNA
as topological quantum computer hypothesis assumes that DNA nucleotides are connected to cell
membrane by ﬂux tubes deﬁning braids playing a key role in topological quantum computation [K23]
. Therefore magnetic body is essential for realizing the software of biological intelligence. The essential
assumption is that magnetic body carries dark matter consisting of ordinary with a non-standard value
of Planck constant. The phase transition changing the value of Planck constant change the size scale
of the ﬂux tube and this process together with reconncetion of the ﬂux tubes would deﬁne mechanisms

9.1.2
What is conscious intelligence
The following summary tries to give a brief summary about how conscious intelligence could be
understood in TGD Universe. The view relies heavily on the developents that have occurred during
the last ﬁve years in the understanding of TGD. The vision about life and conscious information and
intelligence as something in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds is certainly the most important
aspect in this respect. Zero energy ontology and the notion of causal diamond (CD) with zero energy
states having interpretation as memes in very general sense is also of central importance.The hierarchy
of Planck constants as an explanation of dark matter and energy as macroscopic quantum phases even
in astrophysical scales and implying that dark matter is a key actor in the drama of life is the third
key element.
Zero energy ontology, causal diamonds, and quantum states as memes
Zero energy ontology was forced by the interpretational problems created by the vacuum extremal
property of Robertson-Walker cosmologies imbedded as 4-surfaces in M 4 × CP2 meaning that the
density of inertial mass (but not gravitational mass) for these cosmologies was vanishing meaning a
conﬂict with Equivalence Principle. In zero energy ontology physical states are replaced by pairs of
positive and negative energy states assigned to the past resp. future boundaries of causal diamonds
(CDs) deﬁned as pairs of future and past directed light-cones (δM 4
± × CP2). The net values of all
conserved quantum numbers of zero energy states vanish. Zero energy states are interpreted as pairs
of initial and ﬁnal states of a physical event such as particle scattering so that only events appear in
the new ontology.
Zero energy ontology combined with the notion of quantum jump resolves several problems. For
instance, the troublesome questions about the initial state of the universe and about the values of
conserved quantum numbers of the Universe can be avoided since everything is in principle creatable
from vacuum. Communication with the geometric past using negative energy signals and time-like
entanglement are crucial for the TGD inspired quantum model of memory and both make sense in
zero energy ontology. Zero energy ontology leads to a precise mathematical characterization of the
ﬁnite resolution of both quantum measurement and sensory and cognitive representations in terms of
inclusions of von Neumann algebras known as hyperﬁnite factors of type II1 [K92] . The space-time
correlate for the ﬁnite resolution is discretization which appears also in the formulation of quantum
TGD in terms of the modiﬁed Dirac action [K25] .
At the imbedding space-level CD is the correlate of self whereas space-time sheets having their ends
at the light-like boundaries of CD are the correlates at the level of 4-D space-time. The hierarchy
of CDs within CDs corresponds to the hierarchy of selves. Zero energy ontology leads also to an
argument explaining why the arrow of subjective time induces an apparent arrow of geometric time
as a result if intentional action and why the contents of sensory consciousness is restricted to such a
narrow time interval (located near the future boundary of CD) [K3] .
The original interpretation of the space-time correlates of mental images was as mind-like space-
time sheets identiﬁed as space-time sheets with a ﬁnite temporal size. In zero energy ontology all
space-time sheets have a ﬁnite size and serve as correlates for zero energy states, which could be
interpreted as representations of laws of physics as superpositions of pairs of initial and ﬁnal states
given by M-matrix. In state function reduction process these states are reduced to states for which
only negentropic time-like entanglement is possible and one might say that the negentropy measures
the conscious information associated with the ﬁnal state of the reduction process. One can interpret
negentropic quantum states as memes or morphogenetic ﬁelds [K69] , [I33] These negentropic quantum
states are possible only in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds so that living systems are the
systems carrying information and intelligence.
Boolean mind and fermions
The connection of fermionic Fock space basis with Boolean algebra was one of the ﬁrst ideas related
to the quantum modelling of intelligent systems. The state basis for the fermionic Fock space has a
natural interpretation as Boolean algebra (fermion number =1/0↔yes/no). In this manner ordinary

9.1. Introduction
433
Boolean algebra is extended to a vector space spanned by fermionic states. Fermion number conser-
vation poses an obvious problem for this scenario in positive energy ontology. Zero energy ontology
resolves this problem quite generally and zero energy states resulting as an outcome of state func-
tion reduction process represent Boolean statements of type A→B in terms of time-like negentropic
entanglement in fermionic degreees of freedom.
The original proposal was to use cognitive fermion pairs instead of fermions with fermion and
antifermion located at the opposite throats of wormhole contact. In the recent formulation of quantum
TGD bosons and their super counterparts correspond to wormhole contacts. An interesting question is
whether one could consider ordinary Boolean logic as some kind of limit for the complex quantum logic
and whether our logical mind could have something to do with Boolean algebra. For instance, could
primary ’this is true’ experiences correspond to Boolean qualia having increments of fermionic quantum
numbers as physical correlates.
Boolean truth values could also correspond to spin directions of
fermions. In this case fermion number conservation does not pose any constraints and the macrosopic
realization replaing single spin as a representative of bit with a magnetized ensemble of fermions,
makes the realization robust.
Negentropic entanglement means that qubits are always fuzzy and the fuzziness depends on the
situation. The positive aspect is that the quantum superposition gives rise to an abstraction, rule
about pairing of say initial and ﬁnal states represented as positive and negative energy parts of
zero energy state with the pairs of superposition representing the instances of the rule. p-Adic-real
entanglement with positive deﬁnite number theoretical entanglement entropy in the intersection of
real and p-adic worlds could give rise the experience of understanding and makes possible cognitive
quantum computation like processes.
p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intention
The vision about p-adic physics as physics of cognition has gradually established itself as one of the
key idea of TGD inspired theory of consciousness. There have been several motivations for this idea.
Perhaps the strongest motivation is the vision about living matter as something residing in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds. One of the earliest motivations was p-adic non-determinism
identiﬁed tentatively as a space-time correlqte for the non-determinism of imagination. p-Adic non-
determinism follows from the fact that functions with vanishing derivatives are piecewise constant
functions in the p-adic context. More precisely, p-adic pseudo constants depend on the pinary cutoﬀ
of their arguments and replace integration constants in p-adic diﬀerential equations. In the case of
ﬁeld equations this means roughly that the initial data are replaced with initial data given for a
discrete set of time values chosen in such a manner that unique solution of ﬁeld equations results.
Solution can be ﬁxed also in a discrete subset of rational points of the imbedding space. Presumably
the uniqueness requirement implies some unique pinary cutoﬀ.
Thus the space-time surfaces representing solutions of p-adic ﬁeld equations are analogous to space-
time surfaces consisting of pieces of solutions of the real ﬁeld equations. Thus p-adic reality is much
like the dream reality consisting of rational fragments glued together in illogical manner or pieces of
child’s drawing of body containing body parts in more or less chaotic order.
The obvious looking interpretation for the solutions of the p-adic ﬁeld equations is as a geometric
correlate of imagination. Plans, intentions, expectations, dreams, and cognition in general are expected
to have p-adic space-time sheets as their geometric correlates. This in the sense that p-adic spacetime
sheets somehow initiate the real neural processes providing symbolic counterparts for the cognitive
representations provided by p-adic spacetime sheets and p-adic fermions. A deep principle seems to
be involved: incompleteness is characteristic feature of p-adic physics but the ﬂexibility made possible
by this incompleteness is absolutely essential for imagination and cognitive consciousness in general.
p-Adic space-time regions can suﬀer topological phase transitions to real topology and vice versa
in quantum jumps replacing space-time surface with a new one. This process has interpretation as
a topological correlate for the mind-matter interaction in the sense of transformation of intention
to action and symbolic representation to cognitive representation. p-Adic cognitive representations
could provide the physical correlates for the notions of memes [J37] and morphic ﬁelds [I33] . p-
Adic real entanglement makes possible makes possible cognitive measurements and cognitive quantum
computation like processes, and provides correlates for the experiences of understanding and confusion.
Although p-adic space-time sheets as such are not conscious, p-adic physics would provide beautiful
mathematical realization for the intuitions of Descartes.
The formidable challenge is to develop

434
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
experimental tests for p-adic physics. The basic problem is that we can perceive p-adic reality only as
’thoughts’ unlike the ’real’ reality which represents itself to us as sensory experiences. Thus it would
seem that we should be able generalize the physics of sensory experiences to physics of cognitive
experiences. The developments related to the p-adic view about cognition are left to [K52] .
Life as something in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and negentropic entangle-
ment
In the p-adic context one must modify Shannon’s deﬁnition of entropy by replacing the ordinary
logarithm based on p-adic norm. This deﬁnition gives rise to a real valued entropy in both real and p-
adic contexts if entanglement coeﬃcients are rational/algebraic numbers. For irrational/non-algebraic
entanglement standard Shannon formula and its p-adic variant must be used and gives rise to non-
negative entropy. Unlike Shannon entropy, the p-adic entropies (one for each p) can be also negative
so that the entanglement entropy deﬁnes a genuine information measure whose sign tells whether the
system contains information or dis-information. For the p-adic entropies Negentropy Maximization
Principle [K44] tends to preserve the quantum coherence if p divides the common denominator of
the entanglement probabilities. The states with rational/algebraic entanglement can be regarded as
new kind of bound states, which are not at all fragile like the states with irrational/non-algebraic
entanglement are. In particular, these states need not be bound due to the binding energy.
For instance, the problematic notion of high energy phosphate bond could be understood in terms of
negentropic entanglement making possible correlations without binding energy so that the ATP→ADP
process deﬁning fundamental step of metabolism could be interpreted in terms of negentropy transfer.
Negentropic entanglement is highly stable in state function reduction process so that the randomness
of quantum jump does not apply to it.
As a consequence, the second law of thermodynamics is
broken in the scale deﬁned by the size of CD involved. A natural interpretation is that subselves lose
consciousness as ordinary entropic bound state entanglement is generated but experience expansion
of consciousness when negentropic entanglement is generated. Positive emotions like love, experience
of understanding would naturally accompany the generation of negentropic entanglement.
These observations lead to a purely number-theoretic characterization of life: life is in the inter-
section of real and p-adic worlds: life corresponds to islands of rational/algebraic numbers in the seas
of real and p-adic continua. This vision have rapidly become the most important source of insight in
attempts to develop TGD based vision about conscious intelligence.
Hierarchy of Planck constants and consciousness
The hierarchy of Planck constants is realized in terms of a generalization of the causal diamond
CD × CP2, where CD is deﬁned as an intersection of the future and past directed light-cones of 4-D
Minkowski space M 4. CD × CP2 is generalized by gluing singular coverings and factor spaces of both
CD and CP2 together like pages of book along common back, which is 2-D sub-manifold which is M 2
for CD and homologically trivial geodesic sphere S2 for CP2 [K24] . The value of the Planck constant
characterizes partially given page and arbitrary large values of ℏare predicted so that macroscopic
quantum phases are possible since the fundamental quantum scales scale like ℏ. All particles in the
vertices of Feynman diagrams have the same value of Planck constant so that particles at diﬀerent
pages cannot have local interactions. Thus one can speak about relative darkness in the sense that
only the interactions mediated by the exchange of particles and by classical ﬁelds are possible between
diﬀerent pages. Dark matter in this sense can be observed, say through the classical gravitational and
electromagnetic interactions. It is in principle possible to photograph dark matter by the exchange
of photons which leak to another page of book, reﬂect, and leak back. This leakage corresponds to
ℏchanging phase transition occurring at quantum criticality and living matter is expected carry out
these phase transitions routinely in bio-control. This picture leads to no obvious contradictions with
what is really known about dark matter and to my opinion the basic diﬃculty in understanding of
dark matter (and living matter) is the blind belief in standard quantum theory.
Dark matter hierarchy and p-adic length scale hierarchy would provide a quantitative formulation
for the self hierarchy. To a given p-adic length scale one can assign a secondary p-adic time scale
as the temporal distance between the tips of the causal diamond (pair of future and past directed
light-cones in H = M 4 × CP2). For electron this time scale is .1 second, the fundamental biorhythm.
For a given p-adic length scale dark matter hierarchy gives rise to additional time scales coming as

9.2. How to deﬁne measures for the information content of consciousness?
435
ℏ/ℏ0 multiples of this time scale. These two hierarchies could allow to get rid of the notion of self
as a primary concept by reducing it to a quantum jump at higher level of hierarchy. Self would in
general consists of quantum jumps inside quantum jumps inside... and thus experience the ﬂow of
time through sub-quantum jumps.
The hierarchy of Planck constants means the possibility of temporal zooms of the event sequences
of the external world making possible ’stories’ as either zoomed up or zoomed down versions of the
actual course of events. This makes possible simulation in the time natural time scales of neuronal
activity and is expected to be a key element of conscious intelligence.
9.1.3
The meanings of sensory, cognitive, symbolic
With my physicist’s background I have used the attributes sensory, cognitive and symbolic somewhat
sloppily and the precise meanings of these become only gradually clear. The recent view is that p-adic
space-time sheets correspond to cognition and that their intersections with real space-time sheets in
the intersection of real and p-adic worlds deﬁne cognitive representations. These representations are
deﬁned in terms of data coming from the rational and algebraic points common to real and partonic
2-surfaces with the algebraic extension in question characterized by the mathematical representation
of the partonic 2-surfaces making sense for both real and p-adic 2-surfaces simultaneously. Discrete
set of points is always in question. A number theoretic variant of quantum ﬁeld theory is needed in
order to have a ﬁrst principle description of conscious intelligence and intentionality.
The classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action quite generally implies that space-time surfaces
deﬁne what might be called symbolic representations realizing quantum classical correspondence.
This applies irrespective of the number ﬁeld used and in p-adic context p-adic non-determinism is an
additional ingredient. For instance, nerve pulse patterns deﬁne symbolic real physics representations
of the sensory input but do not give rise to sensory qualia which reside at the level of the primary
sensory organs (contrary to the expectations raised by various ﬁndings of neuro-science). Sensory
experience is always a multiverse experience since sensory qualia have quantum jump increments as
quantum correlates, and is thus not reducible to the level of space-time.
9.1.4
Topics of the chapter
The topics of the chapter is as follows.
1. Various measures for conscious information are discussed. The basic information measure being
the reduction of entanglement entropy in state function process for given subsystem as it splits
to two parts. Negentropic entanglement is also possible and this kind of systems are stable
against state function reduction to a pair of unentangled states. It is tempting to characterize
self by this entanglement negentropy which is well-deﬁned and positive in the intersection of real
and p-adic worlds.
2. Frieden’s proposal that action principles, inclucing also Maxwell action, could have information
theoretic interpretation is discussed in TGD framework in the hope that this would provide
additional insights about quantum classical correspondence and living matter.
3. The realization of quantum variant of Boolean logic in terms of zero energy fermion states is
discussed.
4. The next sections are devoted to the relationship of TGD based visions about brain as computer,
hologram, and association machine. Also the connection with the neuro science view about brain
is discussed.

How to deﬁne measures for the information content of
consciousness?
In this section my aim is to discuss diﬀerent approaches to the problem how to deﬁne the information
contents of conscious experience rather than advocating any ﬁnal truth. Of course, just at this moment

436
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
the information measures based on entanglement negentropy and associated with self seem to be the
most realistic ones to me personally, but during these 32 years of TGD I have learned that it it is
better to tolerate all views about the solution of the problem even when their mutual consistency is
not obvious. Negentropy Maximization Principle provides the conceptual background and is brieﬂy
summarized before the discussion of information measures.
Negentropy Maximization Principle
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP [K44] ) stating that the reduction of entanglement entropy
is maximal at a given step of state function reduction process following U-process is the basic varia-
tional principle for TGD inspired theory of consciousness and says that the information contents of
conscious experience is maximal. Although this principle is diametrically opposite to the second law
of thermodynamics it is structurally similar to the second law. NMP does not dictate the dynamics
completely since in state function reduction any eigen state of the density matrix is allowed as ﬁnal
state. NMP need not be in contradiction with second law of thermodynamics which might relate as
much to the ageing of mental images as to physical reality.
Basic form of NMP
Negentropy Maximization Principle (NMP) in its original form codes for the basic rules of the standard
state function reduction and implies that system ends up to an eigenstate of the density matrix
identiﬁed as observable. In TGD framework must ask whether NMP should be restricted only to the
entanglement between zero modes of WCW representing classical degrees of freedom and quantum
ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom or generalize it to apply to any pair of subsystems so that state function
reduction sequence could be regarded as a sequence of self measurements. I have chosen the latter
option as a working hypothesis.
NMP that the state function reduction process following U-process gives rise to a maximal re-
duction of entanglement entropy at each step of the process. State function process could proceed
at the level of all CDs. It is not clear whether one can assign any geometric time duration to this
process or whether there is any need for this. If the ubsystem allows entangled pairs of free systems
(no binding energy) there is more or less unique pair with the maximal entanglement entropy and
NMP therefore implies a decomposition to a unique pair of unentangled systems. The process repeats
itself for these systems and stops when the resulting subsystem cannot be decomposed to a pair of free
systems since energy conservation makes the reduction of entanglement kinematically impossible in
the case of bound states. Number theoretic entanglement entropies mean an important modiﬁcation
of this picture.
Number theoretic Shannon entropy as information
The notion of number theoretic entropy obtained by can be deﬁned by replacing in Shannon entropy the
logarithms of probabilities pn by the logarithms of their p-adic norms |pn|p. This replacement makes
sense for algebraic entanglement probabilities if appropriate algebraic extension of p-adic numbers is
used. What is new that entanglement entropy can be negative, so that algebraic entanglement can
carry information and NMP can force the generation of bound state entanglement so that evolution
could lead to the generation of larger coherent bound states rather than only reducing entanglement.
A possible interpretation for algebraic entanglement is in terms of experience of understanding or
some positive emotion like love.
Standard formalism of physics lacks a genuine notion of information and one can speak only about
increase of information as a local reduction entropy. It seems strange that a system gaining wisdom
should increase the entropy of the environment. Hence number theoretic information measures could
have highly non-trivial applications also outside the theory consciousness.
NMP combined with number theoretic entropies leads to an important exception to the rule that
the generation of bound state entanglement between system and its environment during U process
leads to a loss of consciousness. When entanglement probabilities are rational (or even algebraic)
numbers, the entanglement entropy deﬁned as a number theoretic variant of Shannon entropy can
be non-positive (actually is) so that entanglement carries information. NMP favors the generation of
algebraic entanglement. The attractive interpretation is that the generation of algebraic entanglement
leads to an expansion of consciousness (”fusion into the ocean of consciousness”) instead of its loss.

9.2. How to deﬁne measures for the information content of consciousness?
437
State function reduction period of the quantum jumps involves much more than in wave mechan-
ics. For instance, the choice of quantization axes realized at the level of geometric delicacies related
to CDs is involved. U-process generates a superposition of states in which any sub-system can have
both real and algebraic entanglement with the external world. If state function reduction involves
also a choice between generic and negentropic entanglement (between real world, a particular p-adic
world, or their intersection) it might be possible to identify a candidate for the physical correlate for
the choice between good and evil. The hedonistic complete freedom resulting as the entanglement
entropy is reduced to zero on one hand, and the algebraic bound state entanglement implying cor-
relations with the external world and meaning giving up the maximal freedom on the other hand.
The hedonistic option is risky since it can lead to non-algebraic bound state entanglement implying
a loss of consciousness. The second option means expansion of consciousness - a fusion to the ocean
of consciousness as described by spiritual practices. Note that if the total entanglement negentropy
deﬁned as sum of contributions from various levels of CD hierarchy up to the highest matters in NMP
then also subselves should develop negentropic entanglement. For instance, the generation of entropic
entanglement at cell level can lead to a loss of consciousness also at higher levels. Life would evolve
from short to long scales.
Can one deﬁne measures for the information contents of mental image?
Despite the fact that one cannot write formula for the contents of conscious experience, one can
deﬁne information measures for conscious experience as diﬀerences of the information measures for
the initial and ﬁnal quantum histories. Negentropy gain is the most natural information measure of
this kind. For instance, the sum of the net entanglement negentropy gains over the steps of the self
measurement cascade could deﬁne a quantity characterizing net information gain for a single moment
of consciousness at each step.
One could also information measure to selves as the entanglement negentropy after the state
function reduction process has ended. This would assign to each subsystem stable under NMP a
negentropy. For bound state entanglement this information would be negative but for negentropic
entanglement it would be positive. One can ask whether the hypothesis that this information increases
during quantum jump sequence is equivalent with NMP. In the case of entire Universe the application
of this principle becomes problematic.
Entropy gradients with respect to subjective time could be used to characterize how the information
gain of conscious experience of self changes. These gradients approach zero when self approaches
thermal equilibrium. In TGD framework entropy gradients correlate with emotions, which means
a somewhat counter intuitive connection between emotions and information gain or loss (consistent
however with the fact that peptides are both informational molecules and molecules of emotion [J102]
). Note that the binding of information molecules to receptors means the formation larger bound
states accompanied by the experience of oneness at molecular level (are sex and spiritual experiences
present already at the molecular level?) and macro temporal quantum coherence so that quantum
computer like operations might become possible.
Life as islands of rational/algebraic numbers in the seas of real and p-adic continua?
Rational and even algebraic entanglement coeﬃcients make sense in the intersection of real and p-adic
words, which suggests that life and conscious intelligence reside in the intersection of the real and
p-adic worlds. This would mean that the mathematical expressions for the space-time surfaces (or
at least 3-surfaces or partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D tangent planes) make sense in both real and
p-adic sense for some primes p. Same would apply to the expressions deﬁning quantum states. In
particular, entanglement probabilities would be rationals or algebraic numbers so that entanglement
can be negentropic and the formation of bound states in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds
generates information and is thus favored by NMP.
The identiﬁcation of intentionality as the basic aspect of life seems to be consistent with this idea.
1. The proposed realization of the intentional action has been as a transformation of p-adic space-
time sheet to a real one. Also transformations of real space-time sheets to p-adic space-time
sheets identiﬁable as cognitions are possible. Algebraic entanglement is a prerequisite for the
realization of intentions in this manner. Essentially a leakage between p-adic and real worlds is
in question and makes sense only in zero energy ontology. The reason is that various quantum

438
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
numbers in real and p-adic sectors are not in general comparable in positive energy ontology so
that conservation laws would be broken or even cease to make sense.
2. The transformation of intention to action can occur if the partonic 2-surfaces and their 4-D
tangent space-distributions are representable using rational functions with rational (or even
algebraic) coeﬃcients in preferred coordinates for the imbedding space dictated by symmetry
considerations. Intentional systems must live in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
3. For the minimal option life would be also eﬀectively 2-dimensional phenomenon and essentially a
boundary phenomenon as also number theoretical criticality suggests. There are good reasons to
expect that only the data from the intersection of real and p-adic partonic two-surfaces appears
in U-matrix so that only the data from rational and some algebraic points of the partonic 2-
surface dictate U-matrix. This means discretization at parton level and something which might
be called number theoretic quantum ﬁeld theory should emerge as a description of intentional
action.
A good guess is that algebraic entanglement is essential for quantum computation, which therefore
might correspond to a conscious process. Hence cognition could be seen as a quantum computation
like process, a more approriate term being quantum problem solving [K23] . Living-dead dichotomy
could correspond to rational-irrational or to algebraic-transcendental dichotomy: this at least when
life is interpreted as intelligent life. Life would in a well deﬁned sense correspond to islands of rational-
ity/algebraicity in the seas of real and p-adic continua. Life as a critical phenomenon in the number
theoretical sense would be one aspect of quantum crticality of TGD Universe besides the criticality
of the space-time dynamics and the criticality with respect to phase transitions changing the value of
Planck constant and other more familiar criticalities. How closely these criticalities relate remains an
open question [K69] .
The view about the crucial role of rational and algebraic numbers as far as intelligent life is
considered, could have been guessed on very general grounds from the analogy with the orbits of a
dynamical system. Rational numbers allow a predictable periodic decimal/pinary expansion and are
analogous to one-dimensional periodic orbits. Algebraic numbers are related to rationals by a ﬁnite
number of algebraic operations and are intermediate between periodic and chaotic orbits allowing an
interpretation as an element in an algebraic extension of any p-adic number ﬁeld. The projections of
the orbit to various coordinate directions of the algebraic extension represent now periodic orbits. The
decimal/pinary expansions of transcendentals are un-predictable being analogous to chaotic orbits.
The special role of rational and algebraic numbers was realized already by Pythagoras, and the fact
that the ratios for the frequencies of the musical scale are rationals supports the special nature of
rational and algebraic numbers. The special nature of the Golden Mean, which involves
√
5, conforms
the view that algebraic numbers rather than only rationals are essential for life.
Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 and NMP
Hyper-ﬁnite factors of type II1 bring in additional delicacies to NMP. The basic implication of ﬁnite
measurement resolution characterized by Jones inclusion is that state function reduction can never
reduce entanglement completely so that entire universe can be regarded as an inﬁnite living organism.
It would seem that entanglement coeﬃcients become N valued and the same is true for eigen states
of density matrix. For quantum spinors associated with M/N entanglement probabilities must be
deﬁned as traces of the operators N. An open question is whether entanglement probabilities deﬁned in
this manner are algebraic numbers always (as required by the notion of number theoretic entanglement
entropy) or only in special cases.
9.2.1
Various kinds of information measures
The concepts of information, information ﬂow and information gain of conscious experience would
seem to have a natural place in theories of consciousness. It seems intuitively obvious that conﬁg-
uration space spinor ﬁelds must contain information. Conﬁguration space spinor ﬁelds have indeed
interpretation as both objective realities and Platonic Ideas, the latter interpretation being suggested
strongly by the possibility to interpret fermionic Fock state basis as a Boolean algebra of statements
about statements. The basic statements are most naturally statements about space-time geometry

9.2. How to deﬁne measures for the information content of consciousness?
439
since fermionic oscillator operators for X3 are determined by the second quantized free quantum ﬁeld
theory for the induced spinors on space-time surface X4(X3) [K43] .
State function reduction process consists of a sequence of self measurements both in zero modes and
in quantum ﬂuctuating ﬁber degrees of freedom ultimately leading to a competely unentangled state
decomposing to a product of entropically entangled bound states and states for which every decom-
position to a pair of subsystems is negentropically entangled. At each step when system decomposes
to a unique pair of unentangled subsystems. The entanglement probabilities deﬁned by the density
matrix for either subsystem characterize the probabilities for the outcomes of the self measurement.
Both unentangled subsystems resulting in the ﬁrst step are again subject to self measurements and
the process continues until an unentangled state results. Consider now the information measures.
1. The reduction of entanglement entropy deﬁnes a natural measure for conscious information gain
in single step of the state of state function reduction process decomposing subsystem to a pair
of un-entangled sub-systems. If entanglement is negentropic the entanglement negentropy either
increases or the system is stable against state function reduction.
2. It seems natural to assume that the information measures are associated with the entire cascade
and that they are additive in the sense that information gain is sum over the information gains
of the steps of the cascade and that a given step contributes by the sum of the information gains
associated with unentangled subsystems which are subject to self measurement in a given step
of the cascade.
3. One can also assign information measures to the resulting indecomposable systems. For sub-
system which is bound state in the normal sense and thus has entropic entanglement, one can
consider all possible decomposition of the system to a sub-system and its complement and deﬁne
the entanglement negentropy as the negative for the minimum value of entropy obtained in this
manner. If the system is negentropically entangled one can deﬁne entanglement negentropy as
the maximum of entanglement negentropy obtained in this manner. This means that one can
assign to the ﬁnal state of state function reduction unique negentropy as the sum of the negative
contributions associated with selves which are internally bound state entangled and positive
contributions of negentropic selves.
4. The information content of the conscious experience associated with self is more interesting
practically.
Since self deﬁnes a statistical ensemble, it is straightforward to deﬁne entropies
associated with the increments of quantum numbers and zero modes deﬁning non-geometric
and geometric qualia. These entropies characterize the fuzziness of the quale and are ’negative’
information measures.
One can also assign to non-decomposable subselves the information
measures and they give either positive or negative contribution to the information content of
self.
5. In principle this allows to deﬁne also the net information gain of quantum jump as the diﬀerence
of the total negentropies of the ﬁnal and initial states of quantum jump identiﬁed as those
produced by the state function reduction process. Initial and ﬁnal state negentropies would
characterize spinor ﬁelds of WCW (”world of classical worlds”).
NMP in its recent form is a purely local principle and leads to a unique sequence of state function
reductions. The argument for how the arrow of psychological time emerges involves the notion of
”curious self”, which need not reduce to NMP in its recent form. One can also ask whether NMP is
general enough to explain the emergence of new CDs as spot-lights of attention and their dynamics.
For instance, should (could) NMP be replaced with a variant in which the maximized negentropy gain
is the diﬀerence of negentropies for initial and ﬁnal states of the quantum jump such that one allows
the appearence of new sub-CDs deﬁning subsystems.
9.2.2
Information concept at space-time level
Quantum-classical correspondence suggests that the notion of information is well deﬁned also at the
space-time level. The non-determinism of K¨ahler aciton and p-adic non-determinism plus algebraic
information measures suggest a natural approach tot the problem of deﬁning the information concept.
This approach provides also a new light to the problem of assigning a p-adic prime to a given real
space-time sheet.

440
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
How to assign an information measure to a space-time sheet?
In the presence of the classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action and p-adic non-determinism one
can indeed deﬁne ensembles, and therefore also probability distributions and entropies. For a given
space-time sheet the natural ensemble consists of the deterministic pieces of the space-time sheet
regarded as diﬀerent states of the same system. The probability for the appearance of a given value of
observable is of the general form pi = mi/N, mi < N, where N is the number of deterministic pieces
and Sp is always negative, when p divides N.
Obviously the primes dividing N deﬁne natural candidates for the information measures but the
problem is which criterion selects one of them. There are three options.
1. Require that the information measure corresponds to the prime p for which Sp is smallest.
Obviously p must divide N.
2. Deﬁne the information as sum
I = −
X
p|N
Sp ,
(here p|N means that p divides N) so that all contributions are positive.
3. Include all primes dividing N or mi in pi = mi/N:
I = −
X
p|N or p|mi
Sp ,
In this case also negative contributions are present. This deﬁtion is actually equivalent with a
deﬁnition
I = −
X
p
Sp ,
in which the summation appears over all primes. One could say that the information decomposes
into diﬀerent kinds of informations labelled by primes.
What is interesting is that, the ordinary Shannon entropy S for rational probabilities can be
expressed as a sum of all p-adic entropies using the adelic decomposition |x| = Q
p |x|−1
p :
S = −
X
p
Sp = I .
The sum of real and p-adic entropies vanishes. Real dis-information and the p-adic information
would compensate each other completely. Whether the adelic formula for information theory
might have some deeper interpretation remains open.
How to assign p-adic prime or primes to a real space-time sheet?
A long-standing problem of quantum TGD is how to associate to a given real (not only p-adic) space-
time sheet a unique p-adic prime (or possibly several of them) as required by the p-adic length scale
hypothesis.
1. One could achieve this by requiring that for this prime the negentropy associated with the
ensemble is maximal. The simplest hypothesis is that a real space-time sheet consisting of N
deterministic pieces corresponds to the p-adic prime deﬁning the largest factor of N.
2. One could also consider a more general possibility.
If N contains pn as a factor, then the
real fractality above n-ary p-adic length scale Lp(n) = p(n−1)/2Lp corresponds to smoothness
in the p-adic topology. This option is more attractive since it predicts that the fundamental
p-adic length scale Lp for a given p can be eﬀectively replaced by any integer multiple NLp,
such that N is not divisible by p. There is indeed a considerable evidence for small p p-adicity

9.2. How to deﬁne measures for the information content of consciousness?
441
in long length scales. For instance, genetic code and the appearance of binary pairs like cell
membrane consisting of liquid layers suggests 2-adicity in nano length scales. This view means
that the fractal structure of a given real space-time sheet represents both an integer N and its
decomposition to prime factors physically. This would also mean that one can assign several
p-adic information measures to the real space-time sheet. This obviously conforms with the
physics as a generalized number theory vision.
3. Intuitively it seems obvious that there must be a physical mechanism selecting one prime amongst
all possible primes which characterizes the information measure associated with the ensemble
of the deterministic pieces associated with the real space-time sheet. Conscious information
requires the presence of cognition: the real space-time sheet must be entangled with a p-adic
space-time sheet. Quantum-classical correspondence means that the ognitive entanglement of
the real system with p-adic system has as a space-time correlate join along boundaries bond
connecting the real and p-adic space-time sheet and glued to the boundary of the real space-
time sheet along common rational points. One could argue that the p-adic join along boundaries
bonds are most probable when the p-adic prime is such that it deﬁnes an eﬀective p-adic topology
for the real space-time sheet. This would mean that the prime-power factors of N deﬁne preferred
p-adic length scales to the real space-time sheet.
4. The hypothesis that the prime factorization of N determines the eﬀective p-adic topologies
associated with the real space-time sheet inspires the hypothesis that the rational (or algebraic)
p-adic-real entanglement necessary for cognitive quantum measurements is probable/possible
only for the p-adic primes dividing N.
Does classical space-time physics represent factorization of integers?
Quantum-classical correspondence suggests that quantum computation processes might have coun-
terparts at the level of space-time. An especially interesting process of this kind is the factorization
of integers to prime factors. The classical cryptography relies on the fact that the factorization of
large integers to prime factors is a very slow process using classical computation: the time needed to
factor 100 digit number using modern computer would take more than the recent age of the universe.
For quantum computers the factorization is achieved very rapidly using the famous Shor’s algorithm.
Does the factorization process indeed have a space-time counterpart?
Suppose that one can map the integer N to be factored to a real space-time sheet with N deter-
ministic pieces. If one can measure the powers pni
i
of primes pi for which the fractality above the
appropriate p-adic length scale looks smoothness in the p-adic topology, it is possible to deduce the
factorization of N by direct physical measurements of the p-adic length scales characterizing the rep-
resentative space-time sheet (say from the resonance frequencies of the radiation associated with the
space-time sheet). If only the p-adic topology corresponding to the largest prime p1 is realized in this
manner, one can deduce ﬁrst it, and repeat the process for N/pn
1, and so on, until the full factorization
is achieved. A possible test is to generate resonant radiation in a wave guide of having length which
is an integer multiple of the fundamental p-adic length scale and to see whether frequencies which
correspond to the factors of N appear spontaneously.
Seeing the prime factorization might be also possible via a direct sensory perception. Oliver Sacks
tells in his book ’The man who mistook his wife for a hat’ [J116] about twins, John and Michael, who
had a mysterious ability to ’see’ large numbers and their prime factorizations despite the fact that
their intelligence quotient was about 60 and they did not have any idea about the notions of integer
and prime. For instance, matchbox was dropped from the table and its contents were spread along the
ﬂoor. Both twins shouted immediately ’111!’. Then John mumbled ’37’, Michael repeated it and John
said ’37’ third time. Obviously this was their sensory representation for the decomposition 111 = 3×37
of number 111 to a product of primes! The explanation of these strange feats suggested in [K70] is a
less general idea about physical representation of the factorization. The proposed mechanism could
indeed explain prime factorization as a sensory perception involving no algorithmic cognition at all.
9.2.3
Information theoretic interpretation of K¨ahler function
An important stimulus in the development of ideas was the Jan 30, 1999 issue of New Scientist [B14]
in which the work of Roy Frieden [B10] about information theoretical interpretation of the variational

442
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
principles of physics was discussed at popular level. The work of Frieden relies on the concept of Fisher
information. One can ﬁnd a precise deﬁnition of the Fisher information in Mathematical Handbooks
but this deﬁnition does not help too much without any further knowledge about Frieden’s work.
Although the article in New Scientist [B14] does not give any mathematical details about Frieden’s
work, it becomes clear that Fisher’s theory as such does not apply to TGD framework. Frieden’s basic
idea seems however extremely attractive. Indeed, TGD inspired theory of consciousness leads to a
hypothesis concerning the information theoretic interpretation of the K¨ahler function.
Frieden’s hypothesis inspired the idea that K¨ahler function (K¨ahler action for a preferred extremal)
has information theoretic interpretation. The recent view about quantum TGD indeed suggests that
a modiﬁed form of this idea might work.
Information theoretic interpretation of action in Frieden’s theory
Frieden [B10, B14] introduces two kinds of information concepts. Fisher information, usually denoted
by I, is deﬁned as the information which can extracted from a physical phenomenon by measurements
of a speciﬁc type. Information J is deﬁned as the information contained by the phenomenon and in
general J −I ≥0 holds true.
The action deﬁning the dynamical equations of a physical theory decomposes into a diﬀerence
I −J, where J is the total information contained by the state and I is the available information. I
and J depend on what is measured. Minimization of I −J for position measurement leads to classical
Newton’s equations.
In classical mechanics J corresponds typically to the integral of potential energy V and I corre-
sponds to the integral of kinetic energy I, in accordance with the decomposition
S =
Z
Ldt,
L = T −V .
Maxwell action is obtained by considering position measurement in presence of charge. For Maxwell
action
S =
Z
(B2 −E2)d4x ,
the entire integral of B2 corresponds to I whereas total (or potential) information J is non-vanishing
only provided there is coupling to external currents.
Information theoretic interpretation of K¨ahler function
Information theoretic interpretation of K¨ahler function -albeit not in the sense proposed by Frieden-
might make sense in TGD framework. Quantum classical correspondence suggests that K¨ahler function
could serve as a classical correlate for quantal information measure deﬁned by negentropy. It is however
essential that one accepts the number theoretic vision that conscious information is possible in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds.
1. Entanglement negentropy is the proper information measure and is negative outside the intersec-
tion of real and p-adic worlds and would therefore correspond to the negative term −J assignable
to K¨ahler electric ﬁelds in the case of Minkowskian signature. For negentropic entanglement the
negentropy would be positive and would correspond to the term I assignable to magnetic ﬁelds.
(a) If this interpretation is correct, magnetic ﬂux tubes would be the carriers of information and
the regions carrying electric ﬁelds- typically electrets in living matter- would be carriers
of entropy.
Magnetic ﬂux tubes deﬁne the basic building block of DNA as topological
quantum computer and carry negentropically entangled quarks at their ends. Magnetic
bodies are also central in the TGD based model of living matter. One must be however be
very cautious in drawing conclusion since the roles of magnetic and electric ﬁelds could be
opposite and the fact is that standard biology ”sees” only the electric ﬁelds.
(b) For regions with Euclidian signature representing generalized Feynman graphs with lines
represented as deformations of CP2 type vacuum extremals one must be very careful with
sign factors. Now however both electric and magnetic contributions would represent either

9.2. How to deﬁne measures for the information content of consciousness?
443
positive or negative information. It would be attractive to assign positive information with
elementary particles. This would conform with the interpretation of magnetic ﬂux tubes
-in particular cosmic strings- as particle like objects.
(c) The conjecture inspired by thermodynamical analogy and quantum classical correspondence
would be that K¨ahler function identiﬁed as negative of K¨ahler action for the preferred ex-
tremal is analogous to entropy and equals to the total entanglement entropy associated
with the fermionic degrees of freedom for a given 3-surface. This principle favors entropic
conﬁgurations carrying electric ﬁelds unless the number of preferred extremals is small for
them and large for negentropic conﬁgurations involving magnetic ﬂux tubes and CP2 type
vacuum extremals belonging to the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. The critical-
ity of K¨ahler action might imply this. For instance, for CP2 type vacuum extremals the
light-like randomness of the 1-D M 4 projection implies large degeneracy. Also the small
deformations of vacuum extremals are expected to have large degeneracies. Also quan-
tum criticality favors large degeneracies. At quantum level number theoretical criticality
favoring negentropic entanglement would be the counterpart for this criticality. NMP un-
derstood in general enough sense could drive the system to the intersection of real and
p-adic worlds.
(d) Without further assumptions the total negentropy of the Universe should be ﬁnite since
otherwise the exponent of K¨ahler action becomes zero. The large degeneracy of the states at
criticality -basically due to the vacuum degeneracy- could however prevent the cancellation
of the vacuum functional even at the limit when vacuum functional vanishes. The 4-D spin
glass degeneracy would allow the Universe to have an inﬁnite information content and thus
escape the expectation based on second law. If this picture is correct magnetic ﬂux quanta
should dominate the action at criticality at least in living matter.
2. Frieden’s approach puts position measurement in a special role and the idea that every mea-
surement type deﬁnes its own physical law was not consistent with the original interpretation of
quantum TGD [K25] .
(a) The formulation of quantum TGD in terms of the modiﬁed Dirac action forces to bring in
measurement interaction terms coupling induced spinor ﬁelds to various conserved charges
by a term linear in charge and conserved fermionic current implied by the criticality of the
preferred extremals of K¨ahler action.
(b) This induces also coupling term to K¨ahler action coding information about conserved
charges to the geometry of space-time surface.
There is inﬁnite number of observables
deﬁned as conserved charges and each of them deﬁnes diﬀerent dynamics.
(c) The conjecture is that all the allowed measurement interactions introduce to K¨ahler func-
tion only a real part of a holomorphic function of the complex coordinates of WCW (world
of classical worlds) so that the K¨ahler geometry of WCW is not aﬀected although the
preferred extremals of K¨ahler action are aﬀected. One could argue that for asymptotic
self-organization patters the ﬁeld equations reduce to those for K¨ahler action. One can
consider also a form of the principle for which the conserved charges aﬀect the preferred
extremals only through the boundary conditions in the interior of space-like 3-surfaces at
the boundaries of CDs. This conforms with the notion of holography stating that the 2-D
partonic surfaces deﬁned as intersections of the light-like 3-surfaces with the future and
past boundaries of CDs and the distributions of their 4-D tangent spaces code for what is
physically relevant.
The p-Adic version of K¨ahler action does not make sense nor is needed at all at conﬁguration space
level. All that is needed is that the p-adic variants of the ﬁeld equations stating the preferred extremal
property of K¨ahler action are satisﬁed.
At quantum level the non-existence of p-adic integration
measure suggests that that each quantum jump involves a complete localization in p-adic conﬁguration
space zero modes: p-adic physics at the space-time level would be completely classical. Complete
localization in zero modes has been assumed to take place also in real degrees of freedom but is
not actually necessary since the symplectic form associated with zero modes deﬁnes a hierarchy of

Quantum criticality and K¨ahler function
The I −J decomposition of the K¨ahler function makes sense in TGD framework although the inter-
pretation of I and J diﬀers from that in in Frieden’s theory. The formal similarity of the vacuum
functional with thermodynamical partition function suggests the interpretation of the vacuum func-
tional as an exponent for the negative of some kind of entropy type variable so that the negative of
the K¨ahler function would correspond to entropy.
The exponent exp(−Kcr) of the negative of K¨ahler function, for a suitable choice of the value αcr
of the K¨ahler coupling strength, should somehow measure the number of some kind of microstates. A
natural identiﬁcation of the ’microstates’ is as a degeneracy caused by the classical non-determinism
of the K¨ahler action, which implies that conﬁguration space integration over 3-surfaces Y 3 at the light
cone boundary involves summation over all possible association sequences going through the same
3-surface Y 3 on the light-cone boundary and having the same value of the K¨ahler function. This
summation brings in a degeneracy factor, which will be referred to as Nd.
An educated guess is that the degeneracy factor Nd is in a good approximation proportional to
the exponent of the negative of the K¨ahler function, when K¨ahler coupling strength has critical value
αcr:
Nd
≃
exp(−Kcr) .
(9.2.1)
Note that αcr depends on the sector Dp of the conﬁguration space since K¨ahler coupling strength
depends on p-adic length scale in a logarithmic manner typically predicted by U(1) gauge theories.
This hypothesis allows to answer to the basic questions related to the deﬁnition of the K¨ahler function.
This hypothesis throws also new light to the precise mechanism of the quantum criticality. At
quantum criticality the degeneracy factor Nd in the functional integral over the conﬁguration space
compensates the exponent of the negative K¨ahler function even when its value is inﬁnite! Criticaliaty
would make possible Universes with inﬁnite conscious information content. Below quantum critical-
ity the probabilities for 3-surfaces having negative K¨ahler function suﬀer exponential cutoﬀso that
only the 3-surfaces for which the value of K¨ahler function per volume vanishes, are important. The
resulting universe is obviously much less interesting than quantum critical universe, which maximizes
complexity. Also the maximum for the total information content of the quantum jump is always ﬁnite
for subcritical universe unlike for quantum critical universe. Above quantum criticality the degeneracy
dominates over vacuum functional and conﬁguration space integral of the vacuum functional diverges
so that the theory becomes mathematically ill deﬁned. Therefore quantum critical universe possesses
maximal complexity and is as interesting and intelligent as universe can be! Note that quantum crit-
icality was already earlier realized to be crucial for consciousness since it makes possible long range
quantum correlations and hence arbitrarily large macroscopic quantum systems.
It deserves to be noticed that the proposed estimate for the value of the degeneracy factor Nd -if
correct- would give for the TGD inspired theory of consciousness a status of a quantitative theory. Once
the value of the K¨ahler function is known, then also the representational (symbolic representations
seem to be in question) capacities associated with the 3-surface are known. A reasonable guess is that
this criterion makes sense also for ﬁnite space-time regions.
Is it possible to interpret K¨ahler electric part of action as a potential information?
Frieden interprets J as a potential information. The motivation comes from classical mechanics, where
energy conservation implies that a situation in which potential energy dominates can transform to
that dominated by the kinetic energy. The regions carrying electric ﬁelds would somehow correspond
to potential information. In the case of Maxwell action LC circuit would be a system in in which
Maxwell action reduces to an action for harmonic oscillator deﬁned as diﬀerence of magnetic energy
LI2/2 and electro-static energy CV 2/2. The total action for an integer multiple of cycles obviously
vanishes. Frieden’s interpretation would be that potential information actualizes when electric energy
becomes magnetic. What looks strange is that the information is created and disappears periodically.
This interpretation is not needed in TGD framework.
Despite this one can ask whether this
interpretation could make sense also in TGD framework and whether it could provide additional
insights.

9.2. How to deﬁne measures for the information content of consciousness?
445
1. Classical electric ﬁelds are in a fundamental role in biochemistry and living biosystems are typ-
ically electrets containing regions of spontaneous electric polarization and one can ask whether
this might be understood in using Frieden’s interpretation. Fr¨ohlich [I19] proposed that oriented
electric dipoles form macroscopic quantum systems with polarization density serving as a macro-
scopic order parameter. Several theories of consciousness share this hypothesis. Experimentally
this hypothesis has not been veriﬁed.
2. TGD suggests much more profound role for the unique di-electric properties of the biosystems:
the presence of strong electric dipole ﬁelds is a necessary prequisite for cognition and life and
could even force the emergence of life. Strong electric ﬁelds imply also the presence of the charged
wormhole BE condensates: the surface density of the charged wormholes on the boundary is
essentially equal to the normal component of the electric ﬁeld so that wormholes are in some
sense ’square root’ of the dipole condensate of Fr¨ohlich! Wormholes make also possible pure
vacuum polarization type dipole ﬁelds: in this case the magnitudes of the em ﬁeld at the two
space-time sheets involved are same whereas the directions of the ﬁelds are opposite.
The
splitting of wormhole contacts creates fermion pairs which might be interpreted as cognitive
fermion pairs. Also microtubules carry strong longitudinal electric ﬁelds.
Cell membrane is the basic example about electret and one of the basic mysteries of cell biology is
the resting potential of the living cell. Living cell membranes carry huge electric ﬁelds: something like
107 Volts per meter. This corresponds to about .06 eV energy gained when unit charge travels through
the membrane potential. During the nerve pulse the electric ﬁeld of the cell membrane changes sign
and therefore goes through zero. This process certainly induces magnetic ﬁeld and would deﬁne a
candidate for a process in which potential information is transformed to actual one twice during the
duration of nerve pulse. In TGD framework it is however not at all clear whether the presence of
strong electromagnetic ﬁeld necessitates the presence of strong K¨ahler ﬁeld. The extremely strong
electric ﬁeld associated with the cell membrane is not easily understood in Maxwell’s theory and
almost vacuum extremal property could change the situation completely in TGD framework.
1. The conﬁguration could be a small deformation of vacuum extremal so that the system would
be highly critical as one indeed expects on basis of the general visiona about living matter as a
quantum critical system. For vacuum extremals classical em and Z0 ﬁelds would be proportional
to each other. The second half of Maxwell’s equations is not in general satisﬁed in TGD Universe
but if one assumes that this is the case approximately, the presence of Z0 charges creating the
classical Z0 ﬁelds is implied. In TGD framework one cannot however exclude the presence of
vacuum charge densities in which case elementary particles as sources of the ﬁeld would not
be necessarily. Neutrinos are the most natural candidates for the carrier of Z0 charge if one
assumes that elementary particles act as sources. Dark variants of ordinary elementary particles
interacting via dark variants of intermediate gauge bosons could make possible the presence of
the needed Z0 charge densities.
2. The unavoidable presence of long range Z0 ﬁelds would explain large parity breaking in living
matter, and the fact that neutrino Compton length is of the order of cell size would suggest
the possibility that within neutrino Compton lengths electro-weak gauge ﬁelds could behave
like massless ﬁelds. These weak interactions within space-time sheet should be distinguished
from those mediated by exchanges between space-time sheets. The description of interactions
as exchanges of virtual particles assigned as wormhole contacts connecting positive and negative
energy MEs which behave like massless states individually could be consistent with the massi-
vation of electroweak gauge ﬁelds. If the transversal size of MEs is of order Compton length of
intermediate gauge boson then long ranged interactions are possible but the low probability that
the second particle absorbs the narrow ME emitted by a particle makes the interaction cross
section small.
3. From the equations for classical induced gauge ﬁelds in terms of K¨ahler form and classical Z0
ﬁeld [K6]
γ = 3J −p
2Z0 ,
QZ = I3
L −pQem ,
p = sin(θW ) .
(9.2.2)

446
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
it follows that for the vacuum extremals the part of the electroweak force proportional to the
electromagnetic charge vanishes for a vanishing value of Weinberg angle parameter p so that
only left-handed couplings to weak gauge bosons remain. The absence of electroweak symmetry
breaking and vanishing of p would make sense below the Compton length of dark weak bosons.
It is more questionable whether it makes sense in the interior of neutrino. If this picture makes
sense it has also implications for astrophysics and cosmology since small deformations of vacuum
extremals are assumed deﬁne the interesting extremals. Dark matter hierarchy might explain
the presence of unavoidable long ranged Z0 ﬁelds as being due to dark matter with arbitrarily
large values of Planck constant so that various elementary particle Compton lengths are very
long.
4. The simplest option is that the dark matter -say quarks with Compton lengths of order cell
size and Planck constant of order 107ℏ0 - are responsible for dark weak ﬁelds making almost
vacuum extremal property possible. The quarks involved with with DNA as topological quan-
tum computer model could be in question and membrane potential might be assignable to the
magnetic ﬂux tubes. The ordinary ionic currents through cell membrane -having no coupling to
classical Z0 ﬁelds and not acting as its sourse- would be accompanied by compensating currents
of dark fermions taking care that the almost vacuum extremal property is preserved. The out-
come would be large parity breaking eﬀects in cell scale from the left handed couplings of dark
quarks and leptons to the classical Z0 ﬁeld. The ﬂow of Na+ ions during nerve pulse could take
along same dark ﬂux tube as the ﬂow of dark quarks and leptons. This near vacuum extremal
property might be fundamental property of living matter at dark space-time sheets at least.
5. The resting state of the cell space-time sheet would represent a situation in which the information
content is nearly zero also locally.
Nerve pulse might change this situation somewhat and
generate net K¨ahler magnetic action serving as a correlate for a negentropic entanglement created
by nerve pulse. This negentropy could be assigned with sub-CD representing the mental image
created and having a duration of order 1 ms. For almost vacuum extremals the nerve pulse
could be as a color rotation not aﬀecting the induced K¨ahler ﬁeld but aﬀecting the em and
Z0 contributions to the K¨ahler ﬁeld. DNA as topological quantum computer suggests that the
nerve pulse induces a two-dimensional ﬂow of the liquid crystal phase deﬁned by lipids of the
cell membrane and this in turn would braiding of the magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting lipids to
DNA nucleotides. This would induces topological a piece of a quantum computation program
by time-like braiding and also space-time braiding coding the nerve pulse sequence to memory.
6. At the level of metabolism the picture about the situation could be following. In the resting
state of the cell unfolded proteins, unfolded portions of proteins, and folded globular proteins
are surrounded by ordered water and strong hydrogen bonds freeze them.
Kind of cellular
winter prevails. The melting of the ordered water makes possible folding of unfolded portions of
proteins and partial melting of globular proteins crucial for the aggregation of proteins deﬁning
basic biological functions at molecular level. Nerve pulse would induce a kind of cellular summer
for a time of order millisecond. The melting of the ordered water would be due to the liberation
of metabolic energy destroying hydrogen bonds and transforming bonds to negentropic bonds.
The needed energy and negentropic entanglement would be provided by ATP molecules.
It
would be tempting to see the process as a generation of negentropic sub-CD lasting a time of
order 1 ms. This interpretation does not require the assumption that K¨ahler electric energy is
transformed to K¨ahler magnetic energy.
To my opinion this argument favors the assumption that K¨ahler ﬁelds are weak but I could be of
course wrong. If the membrane potential is not accompanied by a classical Z0 ﬁeld and if Frieden
is right, nerve pulse should have an interpretation as a temporary transformation of the potential
information to a genuine information taking place twice during nerve pulse. A magnetic pulse with
ﬁeld lines rotating around axon would be generated: perhaps the topologically quantized ﬁeld consists
of ﬂux tubes moving with the velocity of nerve pulse. It is not obvious how to assign to it negentropic
entanglement unless one assumes that wormhole throats within it are entangled negentropically. At
quantum level this could mean that bound state entanglement is transformed to negentropic entan-
glement as the membrane potential goes to zero (twice during the pulse) so that negentropic sub-CD
representing mental image is formed. Interpretation as a transition to a number theoretical criticality

9.2. How to deﬁne measures for the information content of consciousness?
447
from nearly critical state could be appropriate. This picture does not have any obvious connections
with the overall vision about living matter.
The cautious conclusion which is diﬀerent from the earlier one is that strong electric ﬁelds in
living matter relate to quantum criticality rather than to the possibility to interpret them in terms of
potential information.
1. The criticality for the generation of nerve pulse would correspond to the criticality against long
range ﬂuctuactions implied by nearly vacuum extremal property.
2. Epileptic seizures involve anomalously large electric ﬁelds in some brain regions and reduction
of membrane potential near to the critical value for the generation of action potential. Perhaps
epilepsy is the price paid for exceptionally high criticality (recall the characters of Dostojevksi’s
novels having their epileptic attacks!).
Epilepsy has always been the professional disease of
prophets: perhaps precognition necessitates exceptionally strong electric ﬁelds!
Generation of artiﬁcial life by generating almost vacuum extremals with strong electric
ﬁelds?
If strong em and Z0 electric ﬁelds with almost vanishing K¨ahler ﬁelds really characterize living matter
one might have the counterpart of the E = mc2 formula in consciousness theories and make possible the
construction of artiﬁcial life. Also the symbiosis of living systems with electronic systems containing
similar strong electric ﬁelds could be considered. It is however far from trivial whether the existing
electronic systems correspond to almost vacuum extremals. Nanotechonology could be perhaps used
to build strong electric ﬁelds in short length scales. Of course, even ordinary computers might have
some conscious intelligence, not for the reasons proposed by AI people, but because their circuits
contain electric ﬁelds.
One could consider the possibility of testing TGD inspired theory of consciousness by studying
whether the presence of strong electric ﬁelds could lead to any phenomena characteristic for life.
Parity breaking is certainly one such signature. Criticality would be second signature. The total
Maxwell action for these systems gives a precise estimate for their representative resources. In [K58]
an explanation of 1/f noise [A6] , [D10, D1] based on quantum criticality and quantum control of the
behaviour of material space-time sheets performed by mind-like space-time sheets, will be proposed.
If this explanation is correct, 1/f noise serves as a signature for the presence of nearly critical space-
time sheets. Electronic circuits are characterized by 1/f noise as a rule, which indeed suggests that
some kind of primitive cognition is present. One testable prediction is that the generation of electric
ﬁelds should increase the intensity of 1/f noise. The simplest, but not the only possible, explanation
for the eﬀect of anesthetics is that their presence reduces electric ﬁelds of, say, microtubules and cell
membranes. One could also test the eﬀect of anesthetics on 1/f noise appearing in biosystems.
Adaptive robots as an electronic life form?
The construction of artiﬁcial life by building initial value sensitive robots might be a possible break-
through application of the p-adic cognition. What would be needed is just initial value sensitivity:
p-adic memes would take care of the resst.
Mark Tilden is a wellknown builder of robots working in the nuclear physics laboratory of Los
Alamos. Tilden builds his robots by using pieces of used electronics. The robots do not run any
computer program so that the basic philosophy is more or less a diametrical opposite of AI. Rather,
the wiring of the robots is such that in a new situation robot tries for diﬀerent behaviors. For instance,
if robot leg gets stuck, the robot changes the orbit of motion of leg. What is remarkable that the
robots seem to behave like living organisms in some aspects.
Unfortunately, I do not have any scientiﬁc articles about Tilden’s work apart from short description
in his homepage [J23] . In fact, I encountered competely accidentally about Tilden’s work by reading
an article in the Finnish version of Reader’s Digest August 1998 after having seen Stetsoned Tilden
and his tiny robots in a popular science program in Finnish TV telling about the recent situation in
robotics, AI, and artiﬁcial life. The robots of Tilden have surprising abilities to adapt and compete for
energy which they get from the sunlight. Robots seem to literally ﬁght for the sunlight. For instance,
an electronic fellow called Turbot, kills other robots from his territory and collects them to form a
wall against the invasion of other invaders!

448
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
The claimed adaptive feats of these robots suggest that a primitive lifeform is in question and
this is also the belief of Mark Tilden. A general handwaving explanation for the adaptive behavior
is that these systems are at the borderline between chaos and order and adaptive behavior ’emerges’.
Of course, what ’emergence’ means is a complete mystery in the deterministic physics with quantum
eﬀects absent in macroscopic length scales.
That primitive life form might be in question, ﬁts nicely with the TGD view. First of all, all
forms of self-organization involve quantum jumps and consciousness, and the question is only how
important is the role of cognitive consciousness in the behavior of the system. Cognitive consciousness
can become important only if the system is suﬃciently ﬂexible and initial value sensitive so that the
realization of intentional motor actions becomes possible by p-adic-to-real transformations inducing
critical perturbations to the initial-value sensitive behavior.
The in-built ﬂexibility of the robot behavior (a strict opposite of pre-programmed behavior), and
initial value sensitivity make in principle possible self-organization by quantum jumps and eﬀective
quantum control. For instance, robots could contain modules controlled by genuine random number
generators which would be aﬀected by p-adic memes. If p-adic physics is physics of cognition, Nature
itself guarantees, that robots form cognitive representations, and by the ﬂexibility of their motor
system, they are able to transform cognitive representations to motor actions. If p-adic space-time
sheets are indeed memes ﬂoating around and waiting for the opportunity to materialize themselves to
action, the robots of Tilden could provide an excellent opportunity for a meme to reincarnate!
The extreme generality of the p-adic physics means that one cannot exclude the possibility that
electronic systems could quite generally develop p-adic cognitive representations about itself. If so,
can one guarantee that the old electronic components recycled by Tilden do not diﬀer cognitively
from electronic components coming directly from fabric? If they do, two identical robots built from
old and new components might behave diﬀerently. Thus a test for whether the robots have mentality
and some kind of developing personality is whether two physically identical robots behave diﬀerently
under similar circumstances.
Quite generally, one can identify p-adic cognitive representations as the mechanism which gives
the physical system personality and allowing to distinguish even between two electrons p-adically:
of course, Fermi statistics does not allow a state consisting of two electrons in states diﬀering only
cognitively. Quite generally, this kind of test could be the counterpart of Turing test allowing to
deduce whether physical system has cognitive self or not.
Also now negentropic entanglement and the universality of CD time scales raise the hopes that it
might be possible to understand what is involved.
9.3
Logic and fermions
The state basis for the fermionic Fock space has a natural interpretation as a Boolean algebra (fermion
number =1/0↔yes/no). In this manner ordinary Boolean algebra is extended to vector space spanned
by fermionic states.
When cognitive fermion pairs are used instead of fermions, fermion number
conservation does not pose any constraints and full linear superposition of the Boolean algebra elements
is possible. An interesting question is whether one could consider ordinary Boolean logic as some kind
of limit for the complex quantum logic.
The simplest TGD based model for thinking systems leads to the result that thoughts correspond
to quantum states in discrete spaces.
The reason is that slightly non-deterministic classical time
evolution means a ﬁnite number of multi-furcations. These additional dynamical degrees of freedom
correspond to N-element set labelling the diﬀerent time evolutions associated with given initial values.
This suggests that a suitably deﬁned binary Hilbert space having Z2 rather than complex numbers
as a coeﬃcient ﬁeld could provide a simple quantum model for a thinking system. This raises the
following question.
What would a quantum ﬁeld theory in discrete space and with the ﬁeld of complex numbers replaced
with binary numbers Z2 (0,1/Yes,No) look like?
The answer is following.
1. The state basis of the quantum ﬁeld theory deﬁned in N-element set is nothing but a Boolean
algebra consisting of 2N elements: all possible statements about the N elements interpreted as

9.3. Logic and fermions
449
propositions! Bosons and fermions are one and the same thing and behave like fermions since
occupation number can have only the values 0 and 1.
2. The requirement that triangle equality for the inner product is satisﬁed, does not allow linear
superposition and one must choose some orthogonal basis for the space. The absence of quantum
superposition means that theory is completely classical. Thus it seems that Boolean QFT is
completely classical and the transition from classical mechanics to quantum theory could be
regarded as a transition from binary QFT to complex QFT or from a binary logic to complex
logic.
3. Quantization means construction of statements about statements: the simplest model for an
abstraction process one can imagine! One can of course continue this quantization: second,
third, etc., quantization is possible and this corresponds to a construction of statements about
statements about..... Hence a direct connection with the ideas about genetic code emerges.
4. Also the state basis in the Fock space of the ordinary fermions has interpretation as a Boolean
algebra, all possible statements about some propositions (particle with a deﬁnite spin component
is at point x).
9.3.1
The state basis of fermionic Fock space as Boolean algebra
The state basis of a fermionic Fock space can be interpreted as a basis of a Boolean algebra. In quantum
TGD all elementary particles are constructed using fermionic oscillators operators. This suggests that
entire quantum ﬁeld theory is actually a representation of Boolean algebra and N-fermion states
have interpretation as statements about basic propositions labelled by the indices labelling fermionic
oscillator operators. In particular, conﬁguration space spinor structure is constructed in terms of the
fermionic oscillator operators for the second quantized spinor ﬁelds on space-time and this suggests
a deep connection between spinor geometry and logic. Perhaps one could say that quantum logic is
C-valued in the sense that all complex superpositions of a statement and its negation are possible.
In Boolean algebra one can select the maximum number of 2N−1 mutually consistent statements
as axioms. An interesting possibility is that only these mutually consistent statements are physically
realized so that the number of states is reduced by a factor of one half. Amusingly, in the ordinary
fermionic ﬁeld theory the states created by a ﬁnite number of oscillator operators are the counterparts
of the mutually consistent statements, their negations would correspond to a vacuum state obtained as
an inﬁnite product of all creation operators annihilated by creation operators. The states created by
annihilation operators from this states are not allowed in QFT since they would have inﬁnite energy.
One can identify the complex valued linear space of fermions as a generalization of Boolean algebra
to complex Hilbert space. Cognitive fermion pairs could provide realization for this space as pairs of
fermion and antifermion belonging to diﬀerent space-time sheets and representing logical statement
and its negation: the automatic presence of negation is rather natural from the point of view of
consciousness theory. The splitting of the wormhole contacts connecting the space-time sheets gives
rise to annihilation process generating fermion and antifermion pair (fermionic quantum numbers
reside on the boundary components of the split wormhole contact). In this manner one avoids problems
related to fermion number conservation encountered otherwise in physical realization of the fermionic
logic. Alternative possibility is to assume ﬁxed number of fermions and associate truth values with
the direction of spin.
9.3.2
Boolean algebra as Boolean QFT
Boolean algebra B(N) is generated by all possible yes/no statements about N propositions. It consists
of sequences of N binary digits of form (..., 1, 0, 0, .., 1) having value of 0 or 1. Addition is with respect
to Z2 so that 1 + 1 = 0. Boolean algebra is Z2 linear space and the elementwise multiplication of the
binary digits in the string makes it algebra. (0, 0, 0, ..) and (1, 1, ...., ) are zero and unit elements of
the algebra.
Geometrically Boolean algebra B(N) corresponds to all possible subsets of an N-element set. Sum
corresponds to a symmetric diﬀerence (take the union of sets and throw away the common elements).
Multiplication corresponds to the intersection of the sets. Entire set represents unit element and empty

450
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
set zero. Empty set is not physically realizable, or equivalently, the zero element of the Boolean algebra
does not correspond to a physical state in the Z2 Hilbert space deﬁned by the Boolean algebra.
Quantum ﬁeld theory in N-element set formed by the basic propositions (analogous to 3-space in
QFT) means associating to each element of the N-element set creation and annihilation operators and
postulating standard commutation relations with them:
[a†(i), a(j)] = 1 .
One can also consider fermions that is anticommutation relations but since -1=1 in Boolean algebra,
they are equivalent with the bosonic commutation relations so that Boolean bosons and fermions are
one and the same thing in the Boolean QFT.
The states of this QFT are constructed in the usual manner. The only diﬀerence is the occupation
numbers are Z2 valued and are either one or zero just as in the case of fermions. Thus Boolean particles
are fermions always. Since N creation operators are involved one obtains a space generated by 2N
states. The proposition and its negation correspond to the states created by, say I oscillator operators
and the dual of this state created by the remaining N −I oscillators operators. Statement corresponds
to I particles and its negation to I holes in the dual ground state containing all N oscillator operators.
Thus the state basis is nothing but the Boolean algebra associated with the N element set! Thus
the state basis of Z2 valued quantum ﬁeld theory in the set of N propositions is nothing but the
formation of all possible statements about these statements: a model for abstraction process. One can
apply this process to the 2N −1 element set and by continuing this process get a sequence of second
quantizations as a sequence of abstractions.
The assumption of unrestricted linear superposition in Z2 Hilbert space leads to diﬃculties with
Schwartz and triangle inequalities.
The physical interpretation of the theory requires that inner
product satisﬁes Schwartz inequality
|(x, y)| ≤|x||y| .
Linear superposition allows states, say y, with zero norm since any superposition of even number of
orthonormal states has zero norm in Z2. The norm of the inner product of one of the basis states
appearing in zero norm state, call it x, with the zero norm state y equals to one and is not smaller
than the product of the norm of the basis state and state with vanishing norm: one obtains 1 < 0,
which does not make sense if inner product is interpreted as real number (as a Z2 valued number
one could perhaps say 1 = −1 < 0). One ends up to diﬃculties also with the triangle inequality:
|x + y| ≤|x| + |y| if x and y are zero norm states with single common element of orthonormal basis
so that one has |x + y| = 1.
The only possible manner to save Schwartz and triangle inequalities is to assume that linear
superposition is not allowed for Z2 Hilbert space. This in turn means that situation is completely
classical! If the set generating Boolean algebra consists of entire 3-space, this means that every state
is gauge equivalent with an N-particle state of completely localized particles. This in turn implies that
Boolean QFT should be more or less equivalent with classical mechanics and one could understand the
transition from classical physics to quantum physics as the replacement of Z2 with complex numbers
C as the coeﬃcient ﬁeld of the state space.
One can change state basis by unitary transformations. Unitary matrices are obtained from or-
thogonal Z2 valued unit vectors possessing entries equal to 1 or 0. Any unitary matrix corresponds
to a matrix representing the permutation of 2N elements of the basis of the Boolean algebra. Time
development operator in this quantum ﬁeld theory is always deﬁned for a ﬁnite time interval only (the
length of the ’chronon’ is ﬁxed naturally in p-adic QFT) and represents a permutation of this basis.
In particular, a nonlinear transformation of the oscillator operators in general occurs. All unitary
transformations are permutations, which do not
lead to state basis involving superpositions of the
basic states. This is in accordance with the observation that Boolean QFT is completely classical.
9.3.3
Fermions, zero energy ontology, and Boolean cognition
Fermionic Fock state basis deﬁnes naturally a quantum version of Boolean algebra. In zero energy
ontology predicting that physical states have vanishing net quantum numbers, positive and negative
energy components of zero energy states with opposite fermion numbers deﬁne realizations of Boolean
functions via time-like quantum entanglement. One can also consider an interpretation of zero energy
states in terms of rules of form A →B with the instances of A and B represented as elements Fock

9.3. Logic and fermions
451
state basis ﬁxed by the diagonalization of the density matrix deﬁned by M−-matrix. Hence Boolean
conciousness would be basic aspect of zero energy states. Physical states would be more like memes
than matter. Note also that the fundamental super-symmetric duality between bosonic degrees of
freedom (size and shape of the 3-surface) and fermionic degrees of freedom would correspond to the
sensory-cognitive duality.
This would explain why Boolean and temporal causalities are so closely related. Note that zero
energy ontology is certainly consistent with the usual positive energy ontology if unitary process U
associated with the quantum jump is more or less trivial in the degrees of freedom usually assigned
with the material world. There are arguments suggesting that U is tensor product of of factoring
S-matrices associated with 2-D integrable QFT theories [K16] : these are indeed almost trivial in
momentum degrees of freedom. This would also imply that our geometric past is rather stable so that
quantum jump of geometric past does not suddenly change your profession from that of musician to
that of physicist. The maximal diagonality of U-matrix for p-adic-to-real transitions would in turn
favor precise realization of intentions as actions. One must however take this kind of arguments with
extreme caution.
9.3.4
Negentropic entanglement, fuzzy logic, quantum groups, and Jones
inclusions
Matrix logic [A23] emerges naturally when one calculates expectation values of logical functions de-
ﬁned by the zero energy states with positive energy fermionic Fock states interpreted as inputs and
corresponding negative energy states interpreted as outputs. Also the non-commutative version of the
quantum logic, with spinor components representing amplitudes for truth values replaced with non-
commutative operators, emerges naturally. The ﬁnite resolution of quantum measurement generalizes
to a ﬁnite resolution of Boolean cognition and allows description in terms of Jones inclusions N ⊂M
of inﬁnite-dimensional Cliﬀord algebras of the world of classical worlds (WCW) identiﬁable in terms
of fermionic oscillator algebras. N deﬁnes the resolution in the sense that quantum measurement and
conscious experience does not distinguish between states diﬀering from each other by the action of N.
The ﬁnite-dimensional quantum Cliﬀord algebra M/N creates the physical states modulo the
resolution. This algebra is non-commutative which means that corresponding quantum spinors have
non-commutative components.
The non-commutativity codes for the that the spinor components
are correlated: the quantized fractal dimension for quantum counterparts of 2-spinors satisfying d =
2cos(π/n) ≤2 expresses this correlation as a reduction of eﬀective dimension.
The moduli of spinor components however commute and have interpretation as eigenvalues of
truth and false operators or probabilities that the statement is true/false.
They have quantized
spectrum having also interpretation as probabilities for truth values and this spectrum diﬀers from
the spectrum {1, 0} for the ordinary logic so that fuzzy logic results from the ﬁnite resolution of
Boolean cognition [K92] .
9.3.5
Cognitive codes and fermions
p-Adic length scale hypothesis leads to the idea that each p ≃2k, k integer, deﬁnes a hierarchy of
cognitive codes with code word having duration given by the n-ary p-adic time scale T(n, k) and
number of bits given by any factor of k. Especially interesting codes are those for which the number
of bits is prime factor or power of prime factor of k. n = 2 seems to be in special position in zero
energy ontology. This is a strong quantitative prediction since the duration of both the code word
and bit correspond to deﬁnite frequencies serving as signatures for the occurrence of commutations
utilizing these codes.
If k is prime, the amount of information carried by the codon is maximal but there is no obvious
manner to detect errors.
If k is not prime there are several codes with various numbers of bits:
information content is not maximal but it is possible to detect errors. For instance, k = 252 gives
rise to code words for which the number of bits is k1 = 252, 126, 63, 84, 42, 212, 9, 7, 62, 4, 32, 2: the
subscript 2 tells that there are two non-equivalent manners to get this number of bits. For instance,
126 = 42 × 3-bit codon can have 42 -bit parity codon: the bits of this codon would be products of
three subsequent bits of 126-bit codon. This allows error detection by comparing the error codon for
communicated codon and communicated error codon.

Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
Mersenne primes are especially interesting as far as cognitive codes are considered the Mersenne
prime M127 assignable to electron is of special interest since the corresponding time scale for CD is .1
seconds whereas the duration of bit corresponds to the time scale of 1 ms assignable to quark CDs.
Combinatorial Hierarchy as a hierarchy of ’genetic codes’
The simplest model for abstraction process is based on the process in which one forms ﬁrst all possible
Boolean statements about N basic statements, 2N alltogether. If one drops one of the statements
one has MN = 2N −1 statements: MN is Mersenne number. The motivation for the dropping of one
statement might be that in set theoretical realization one of the statements corresponds to empty set
and is not realizable. Alternatively, in the realization based on many-fermion states, vacuum state
could correspond to this kind of state. One can form also statements about statements: the ﬁrst
level of abstraction. This leads to MMN = 2MN −1 many-fermion states. Construction is especially
intersting if the numbers M(MN) are primes, so called Mersenne primes. Indeed, in some cases one
obtains hierarchies of Mersenne primes by repeating the construction as long as it works.
The so called Combinatorial Hierarchy, shown already earlier to provide an explanation for the
numbers of the Genetic Code, emerges as the most notable hierarchy. The Combinatorial Hierarchy
[A24] consists of the Mersenne numbers 2, M(1) = 3, 7 ,127, 2127 −1, .. constructed using the rule
M(n + 1) = MM(n) = 2M(n) −1. The explicitely listed ones are known to be primes. Combinatorial
Hierarchy emerges from a model of abstraction process as subsequent transitions from level to metalevel
by forming Boolean statements about Boolean statements of level n and dropping one statement away
and starting from n = 2 basic statements. Combinatorial Hierarchy results also by constructing the
sets of all subsets with empty set excluded starting from two element set.
The set of statements at level n can be given a structure of Finite Field G(M(n), 1) if M(n)
is prime.
The multiplicative groups ZM(n)−1 form a nested hierarchy and the coset spaces Zkn
≡ZM(n+1)−1/ZM(n)−1 are cyclic groups.
Combinatorial Hierarchy based model of Genetic Code
explains the number of DNA:s and aminoacids and the representation of words of the GC as triplets
of 4 diﬀerent codons. Aminoacids correspond to kn=3 = 21 axioms of a formal system deﬁned by n = 3
level of Combinatorial Hierarchy having a unique imbedding as the group Zkn ⊂ZM(n)−1 = Z126 and
DNA:s correspond to the set XN(DNA) ⊂ZM(n)−1 of N(DNA) = (M(n) + 1)/2 = 64 mutually
consistent statements at level n regarded as special cases of general theorems. GC corresponds to the
mapping x →xkn−1 = x6 in ZM(n)−1 mapping DNA type statements to aminoacid type statements.
The numbers of DNA:s coding single aminoacid are reproduced in a symmetry breaking mechanism
involving the ﬁnite groups Zpn−1 and Zkn and symmetry breaking is in a well deﬁned sense minimal.
The inﬁnite hierarchy of possible genetic codes suggests the possibility of an inﬁnite hierarchy of
increasingly complicated lifeforms or forms of intelligence.
Boolean mind and memetic code
The original proposal for the realization of Boolean mind was in terms of sequences cognitive neutrino
pairs. These can be interpreted as wormhole contacts carrying neutrino and antineutrino at the light-
like wormhole throats and would thus represent boson like entities. In the framework of the standard
model the proposal looks of course completely non-sensical. TGD however predicts the existence of
long range classical electro-weak ﬁelds, and one might imagine that inside neutrino- whose Compton
length corresponds to length scale of cell- intermediate gauge bosons behave like massless ﬁelds.
Although neutrinos could be important, the time scale of corresponding CD - about 104 years -
suggests that cognitive neutrinos might be important in much longer time scale than the .1 second
time scale assignable to the memetic code.
The recent view about TGD allows a much more general view. Zero energy ontology allows to
interpret the fermionic parts of zero energy states as quantum superpositions of Boolean statements of
form a →b with a and b represented in terms of positive and negative energy parts of the zero energy
state. If one has negentropic entanglement this kind of state has interpretation as an abstraction - a
”law of physics”- representing as a quantum superposition various instances of a more general law.
The simplest situation corresponds to a CD having only single positive energy fermion and negative
energy fermion at its light-like boundaries. The fermion number or spin or isospin of the fermion could
represent qubit. The hypothesis that memetic code corresponds to the next level of Combinatorial
Hierarchy, when combined with p-adic length scale hypothesis, led to a prediction of order .1 seconds

9.3. Logic and fermions
453
for the duration of the ’wake-up’ period of subself corresponding to the codeword of the memetic code.
Since the CD assignable to electron has time scale .1 seconds and the CD assignable to u and d quarks
has time scale 1/1.28 milliseconds there is a temptation to proposed that the quark-like sub-CDs of
electronic CD give to a realization of memetic code word as a sequence of 126 quark like sub-CDs.
u and d quarks would be assigned to the magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting DNA and the lipids of the
cell membrane in the model of DNA as topological quantum computer. Clearly, beautiful connection
between new elementary particle physics, genetic code, nerve pulse activity, DNA as topological
quantum computer, logical thought, and the basic time scales of speech are suggestive.
This codeword consists of 126 bits represented by quarks such that the two possible magnetization
directions correspond to the two values of Boolean statement. This implies that the duration of single
bit should 1/1260 seconds. The duration of the nerve pulse is slightly longer than this which might
mean that the full memetic code is realized as membrane oscillations rather than nerve pulse patterns.
Both hearing and vision have .1 second time scale as a fundamental time scale and sounds are indeed
coded to membrane oscillations in ear.
One can consider also the realization of genetic code with six bits of the codon represented by
various scaled up versions of quark CD coming as size powers of 2. In this case the ordering of the
bits would come from the size of sub-CD whereas in previous example temporal ordering would deﬁne
the ordering. It is not however clear whether the powers of two can be realized physically.
One can understand the number 126 as related to the total number of separately experienced
frequencies in the interval 20 −20.000 Hz spanning 10 octaves. 10 × 12 = 120 is not far from 126:
here 12 corresponds to 12 tones of basic music scale. Also speech has 10 Hz frequency as fundamental
frequency. In visual primary cortex replicating triplets, 4-,5- and 6-plets of spikes with highly regular
intervals between spikes have been detected. The triplets are accompanied by ghost doublets. This
would suggest a coding of some features of visual experience to reverberating mental images. The
time scale for various patterns is .1 seconds. This could be seen as a support for the realization of
some degenerate version of the memetic code as nerve pulse patterns.
The model for the memetic code encourages the following conclusions.
1. Membrane oscillation/nerve pulse patterns correspond to temporal sequences of magnetization
directions for quarks representing yes/no Boolean statements.
2. The spin polarization of quarks is changed from the standard direction ﬁxed by the spontaneous
magnetization in the direction of axon by a ME moving parallel to axon, and inducing membrane
oscillation or even a nerve pulse. Nerve pulses could correspond to a degenerate memetic code
resulting by frequency coding for which the number of distinguishable code words is 64, and
would thus naturally correspond to the reduction of the memetic code to the genetic code.
A very precise correspondence with the basic structures of the genetic code results. mRNA →
protein translation corresponds to the translation of temporal sequences o magnetization directions to
conscious cognitive experiences. Under very natural constraints the mapping to cognitive experiences
is not one-to-one and the predicted degeneracy (2126 sequences correspond to (2126 −1)/63 cognitive
experiences) can be understood.
One might think that the full memetic code is an evolutionary newcomer and involved only with
the logical thought: this would explain the completely exceptional characteristics of human brain.
The full memetic code could be realized for certain regions of brain only. These regions certainly
include auditory pathways responsible for the comprehension of speech [K31, K61, K62, K65] .
How nerve pulse patterns and membrane oscillations could be coded to Boolean state-
ments?
The original proposal for the realization of the memetic code was based on the notion of cognitive
neutrino pair. Zero energy ontology however disfavors this identiﬁcation since the time scale assignable
to CD of neutrino is of order 104 years. Therefore neutrinos would most naturally correspond to a
time scale of consciousness much longer than the time scale of .1 seconds predicted to be present. If
the proposed view about cell membrane is correct, classical weak ﬁelds should be important within
the Compton length of any particle and therefore the interactions of neutrinos with Z0 ﬁelds should
be important as also the large chiral asymmetry in living matter suggests.
The realization of memetic codewords in terms of sub-CDs assignable to u and d quarks look much
more attractive option since they have time scale of 1/1.28 millisecond.

454
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
1. The bit would correspond to quark existing in this kind of sub-CD.
Memetic codon would
correspond to electron’s sub-CD containing a row of 127 quark sub-CDs. Standard physics
interpretation could be as quantum ﬂuctuation generating virtual pair of quark and negative
energy antiquark. For non-standard values of ℏthe durations of codewords and bits would be
scaled up.
2. The time-like row of quark sub-CDs resides in em (and possibly also Z0) ﬁeld associated with the
cell membrane and having the direction of the axon. There is a time-like row of quark sub-CD
at some points of axon with one sub-CD per millisecond time interval between sub-CDs. DNA
as topological quantum computer hypothesis suggests that each lipid could correspond to quark
sub-CD so that many-quark system would be in question. The minimization of the magnetic
energy for a given sub-CD ﬁxes the direction of spin and one has spontaneous magnetization in
the case that the direction of magnetic ﬁeld inside quark sub-CD does not change during the
pulse.
3. The time that it takes for a nerve pulse to traverse the point is slightly longer than millisecond.
If the time which magnetic ﬁeld has reversed direction is of order millisecond then the magnetic
ﬁeld experienced by quark can preserve its direction during the time interval that quark exists
from the point of view of outsider. This is achieved if the temporal center of mass positions of
the quark sub-CDs are given by tn = nz0/v, where z0 is the distance between lipids containing
quark sub-CD and the position of nerve pulse is given by z = vt, where v is the conduction
velocity of nerve pulse. Unless this condition is satisﬁed, the direction of magnetic ﬁeld changes
during the time interval associated with sub-CD. In this case a superposition of bits identiﬁable
as a qubit results.
4. This means that nerve pulse sequence deﬁnes a (qu-)bit sequence with the direction of spin
telling whether there was nerve pulse present in particular sub-CD. The presence/absence of
nerve pulse corresponds to true/false statement in accordance with neuro science intuition.
If this view is correct, the values of the positional coordinates and the velocity of the object of the
perceptive ﬁeld should correlate with the CP2 orientation of the active neuron and/or ME(s) associated
with it. First of all, the level of hologrammic activity for ME measured by the strength of the lightlike
em current depends on its CP2 orientation. Secondly, diﬀerent CP2 orientations correspond to slightly
diﬀerent values of the membrane potential and could be directly mapped to the degree of alertness of
neuron. For instance, if a moving object of the perceptive ﬁeld is in nearby space and moves towards
the perceiver, the (Pi, Qi) values could be such that the resting potential is lowered and nearer to the
critical value for ﬁring. Also the lightlike em currents associated with MEs would be stronger in this
kind of situation.
9.4
Quantum computationalism
TGD Universe can be formally regarded as inﬁnite quantum computer like structure in the sense
that each quantum jump involves the unitary process U analogous to a Schr¨odinger evolution lasting
inﬁnite time and is followed by state function reduction and state preparation process. Therefore
TGD suggests what might be called quantum computationalism.
Universe would be performing
huge quantum computation and the computation like processes performed by us or by our brains
would be only a ridiculously small portion of this computation. Of course, this must be taken as a
rough metaphor, the quintessence of the conscious quantum computation like processes could be quite
diﬀerent from the essence of the ordinary quantum computation.
The average increment of the psychological time in quantum jump is rather small: the simplest
guess suggest that the average quantum of psychological time is or order ’CP2 time’, about 104 Planck
times. This means that the relation of the information processing performed by biosystems to quantum
jump would be the same as the relationship of macroscopic physics to physics in CP2 scale about 104
Planck length scales. This would however mean an extremely short decoherence time in an obvious
conﬂict with the experimental facts. Macrotemporal quantum coherence, which corresponds to the
formation of bound states, however eﬀectively fuses a sequence of quantum jumps to a single quantum
jump so that the decoherence occurring otherwise in CP2 time scale can be circumvented.

9.4. Quantum computationalism
455
The notion of self is absolutely crucial for TGD approach to consciousness and makes possible to
understand consciousness in macroscopic time scales. A very natural notion is that of cascades of
selves within selves generated spontaneously or by quantum jumps. This implies a connection with
the basic conceptual structure of computationalism. The cascades have natural modular structure,
which is quintessential for the understanding of the symbol processing performed by brain. A very
attractive hypothesis is that selves within selves are conscious counterparts of computational agents
or more or less equivalently, of the subroutines of computer program. Selves can perform two kinds of
quantum jumps and a natural identiﬁcation of these modes is as computational and sensory (input)
modes. Subjective memory takes automatically care of ouput in the sense that the subjective history
of subself is experienced as an abstracted memory by self.
Communication between selves could occur as it does between human beings. Also ’mass media’
at neuronal level seem to be possible and would make possible the concept of global workspace.
Quantum jumps can be regarded hopping in the space of zero modes identiﬁable as fundamental order
parameters and Haken’s theory of feature recognition generalizes. Quantum entanglement in turn
provides elegant realization of association concept so that the basic ideas of connectionism emerge
naturally from quantum computationalism.
There are also drastic diﬀerences with between TGD
and computationalism, basically implied by the diﬀerent concept of psychological time which implies
that cognition has holistic aspect also with respect to time. Thoughts are deﬁnitely not deterministic
computations and living systems are deﬁnitely not robots.
9.4.1
Computationalism and connectionism
Computational approach to cognition [J105] is the dominating approach in cognititive and neuro
sciences and has had undeniable successes. Computationalism is often identiﬁed as traditional AI based
on the concept of truth preserving manipulation of symbols according to some ﬁxed rules of the formal
system. This approach indeed explains nicely computational aspects of mind. Combinatorial explosion
is the basic failure of the approach at practical level. Connectionism relies on the concept of association
and associative neural net provides a quantitative model for how brain learns. Connectionism is often
regarded as a variant of the computationalism and it is believed that neural nets provide models for
unconscious parallel information processing whereas conscious information processing is best modelled
by hierarchical program like structures. The general philosophical shortcomings of these approaches
are obvious: they cannot provide any insights to the problem how meaning, understanding, emotions
and volition, which are factors crucially important for the functioning of conscious brain, arise. This
has even led some advocates of this approach [J105] to believe that human brain, being computer
basically, is simply uncapable of understanding the problem of consciousness! This would probably
be the case if human beings were robots: fortunately we are not!
Traditional AI approach
In the traditional AI approach brain is modelled as a complicated computer. Computation is real-
ized using rigid algorithms, which are hierarchical structures consisting of subprograms. Using more
abstract terminology, the basic concepts are symbols and agents, ’demons’. Symbols are inputs for
’demons’, subroutines of program manipulating symbols and creating new outputs as symbols. One
could however interpret also agents themselves as symbols. The concept of global work-space [J28]
realizes the intuition that short-term memory is available to many users. Also the concepts of belief
and desire can be formulated without referring to consciousness. Beliefs are inscriptions about the
world and desires are identiﬁed as goals. For instance, problem solving means simply making trials
with the aim of minimizing the diﬀerence between goal and result of trial. The concept of representa-
tion is central. It is known that brain realizes several types of representations [J105] . Visual mosaic
like representations, phonological representations in short-term memory consisting of few phonemes
(say remembering phone number for some time), grammatical language like representations with hi-
erarchical structures and ’mentalese’, which is the most abstract representation type summarizing in
very implicit manner the essentials of, say, mathematical model.
Computationalism explains nicely the general features of language by providing a representation
for the hierarchical structure of language. One can also easily think brain as a population of (possibly)
conscious demons. Some demons receive sensory input, some demons process it and the ouputs of some
demons are realized as motor outputs. It seems that this approach models quite satisfactorily those

456
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
aspects of cognition, which can be realized as purely mechanical truth preserving symbol manipulation
modellable universally by Turing machine. The best proof for the claim that computers have catched
something about the basic structure of cognition is that computers are already now able to beat
chess champions. The weak point of the computationalism is its extreme rigidity: minor input error
or programming error and program fails to work. Combinatorial explosion is second shortcoming.
For instance, all possible melodies formed from ﬁnite number of musical notes with ﬁnite number
of durations for each and lasting the typical length of musical piece is immense. In computer chess
combinatorial explosion makes the simple-minded trial and error approach completely unpractical and
the only possible manner to proceed is to teach the computer by mechanizing the human intuitions
about good chess.
Connectionism and neural nets
Connectionism provides a modern version of associationism proposed by British philosophers Locke,
Hume, Hartley, Berkeley and Mills. Behaviorism was the ﬁrst purely mechanistic version of this ap-
proach but was quite too simplistic to work. Associationism consists of two laws. The ﬁrst law states
that the ideas which are often experienced together get associated: when one is activated also the
other one gets activated. Second law states that similar ideas activate each other. Connectionism
tries to realize these two aspects of associationism mathematically and construct practical realiza-
tions for associative thinking. Typical application would be feature recognition and machines learing
automatically from their inputs some predetermined tasks.
Neural nets provide a mathematical model for the concept of association and associative learning.
The simplest model for learning simply associates unique self-organized state of a dissipative neural
net to the state of the external world represented as an external force driving the neural net. Dis-
sipation realizes also the second law: if input is suﬃciently similar to the standard input generating
given standard output, the standard output is indeed generated.
Also Haken’s model for feature
recognition realizes second law as a feature recognition based on nonequilibrium thermodynamics.
Features correspond to equilibrium states of a nonlinear dissipative system (free energy minima for
order parameters). If input creates initial output belonging to the attractor of the feature, dissipative
dynamics takes care that the asymptotic output is feature.
Associative net can be regarded as a many-layered structure, in which the states of some nodes
correlate strongly with the states of some other nodes. The state of node is characterized by a com-
ponent of vector, whose components give the values of the amplitude in the nodes. For a given input
the net rapidly achieves equilibrium in which the associations created by the input are determined
by those nodes in which the amplitude is large. The equilibrium states of neural nets with coupling
to external are identiﬁed as representations for stable mental states representing some states of the
external world.
The ﬂexibility of the neural nets is the strength of connectionism. Also combinatorial explosion
can be avoided. Neural nets might indeed model lower level cognition which is mostly unconscious to
us. The absence of the hierarchical structures means the loss of ’expressive power’ essential for higher
cognition and leads to the problems decribed in [J105] .
1. Connectionistic approach is not able to distinguish between individual and class: what is created
from the inputs is some kind of average individual: neural network can learn to recognize human
face but not a particular human face or to recognize particular human face but not to make
abstraction about what human face looks like.
2. Second problem is so called compositionality: the ability of the representation to be build
out of parts and represent the meaning of the whole deriving from the meanings of parts. A
related problem are the diﬃculties in the identiﬁcation of the meaning of linguistic expressions.
For instance, the meanings of the expressions consisting of words ’the child’, ’ate’ and ’the
slug’ depend on the order in which the words are represented and connectionism is not able to
distinguish between ’the child ate the slug’ and ’the slug ate the child’. The natural ordering of
symbols provided by hierarchical tree solves this problem in AI approach. Simple neural network
learns easily to recognize picture containing horse but if the picture contains two horses, network
fails completely!
3. The third problem is a combination of these two.
An example from [J105] illustrates this.
Network can learn to sum 1 and 3 to 4. When it learns to sum 2 and 2 to 4 it can lose the

9.4. Quantum computationalism
457
already learned ability. Second example: consider the exression ’Every forty ﬁve seconds some-
one in the United States sustains a head injury’. Human brain can easily realize the meaning of
this sentence which suggests that quantiﬁcation occurs in brain and human brain transforms the
sentence either to expression ”Every forty-ﬁve seconds {there exists an X[who gets injured]}”
instead of ”There exists an X{who every forty-ﬁve seconds[gets injured]}”
4. What multiplies human thoughts is recursion. We can take proposition and give it a role in
another prosition and so on. In this manner a combinatorial explosion of propositions is gener-
ated. To get propositions-inside-propositions network, one could add a new layer of connections
but this solution is clumsy and non-economical.
The addition of a new level of abstraction
would mean a new network containing additional level. In computationalism the solution of the
problem is much more elegant. Each proposition is represented in long term memory once. One
can of course combine computationalism and connectivism and use simple neural networks as
basic modules of computer program like modular structure.
5. Neural net models, which realize connectionistic philosophy in practice, have serious problems
in modelling long term memory. If its is assumed that long term memories are coded into the
matrices deﬁning output of the node in terms of its inputs, which are modiﬁed during learning
process, the unavoidable conclusion is that new memories destroy the old ones.
Childhood
memories seem however to be the most stable ones.
9.4.2
How connectionism emerges from TGD framework?
Brain as an associative net in TGD
TGD leads to a variant of connectionism which diﬀers from the standard version in some crucial
respects. Brain as a quantum self-organizing system moving in spin glass energy landscape generalizes
the neural net realization of connectionism. The plasticity of the neural substrate corresponds directly
to the spin glass property and the notion of frustration fundamental for spin glass type systems is
guaranteed by the inhibitory/excitatory nature of nerve pulses. Neural net becomes dynamical rather
than being a ﬁxed structure. One can view brain as system moving in the space of neural nets and
perceiving and aﬀecting its own position in this abstract space.
Brain can be regarded as a conscious associative net developing by quantum self-organization to
asymptotic self-organization patterns which correspond to recognized features, learned habits, skills
· · · : dissipation can be said to serve as fundamental Darwinian selector in this process. By music
metaphor each neuron, when it ﬁres, generates a characteristic neuronal experience possibly con-
tributing to our conscious experience: only the intensity of this experience depends on the nerve pulse
pattern. The ﬁring of a neuron gives rise to a conscious neuronal association A →B.
This would suggest that brain is like a conscious music instrument, or rather, entire orchestra,
played by the nerve pulse patterns and our experiences corresponds to the sound patterns created
by this orchestra. It has turned out that this view is probably quite not correct. Brain and body
are much more. The music is at the level of sensory organs as sensory qualia, and neural activity
cognizes, that is analyses the sensory music to notes and represents the notes. This view, which is
certainly not possible in the standard neuroscience framework and surprisingly close to what a layman
knowing nothing about neuroscience would think spontaneously, makes sense in TGD framework if
one assumes that entanglement between brain and sensory organs binds sensory qualia with the
cognitive associations generated by the sensory input. This view also allows to understand elegantly
the diﬀerences between sensory experience, dreaming, hallucinations, and imagination. An essential
element is the feedback from brain to sensory organs enabling ”qualifacation” during dreaming and
hallucinations. This feedback is also active during the ordinary wake-up consciousness.
Spin glass energy landscape is four-dimensional in a well deﬁned sense and the identiﬁcation of
the long term memories as geometric memories solves the basic paradox of the neural net models of
memory. One can also understand how brain knows that the mental image represents memory and
why repetition and reverberation of nerve pulse patterns in neural circuits leads to learning and why
emotional experiences are easily remembered.

458
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
Feature recognition
The ﬁrst law of associationism states that similar ideas tend to induce each other. For instance, a part
of familiar face in the visual ﬁeld induces a memory about the entire face. In computational approach
feature recognitition is believed to involve unconscious low level parallel processing. [B11] [B11] has
proposed an elegant model of feature recognition based on non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The
features to be recognized represent the minima of the potential depending on order parameteres and
the presence of dissipative terms implies that system ends up to potential minimum representing
feature.
Haken’s theory generalizes to TGD context almost as such. Dissipative time evolution is replaced
with quantum self-organization by quantum jumps and in each step entire macroscopic space-time
surface is replace by a new one. The zero mode degrees of freedom of the conﬁguration space are
identiﬁable as fundamental order parameters and each quantum jump involves complete localization in
continuous zero modes. The localization in discrete zero modes characterizing cognitively degenerate
space-time surfaces need not be complete: what is needed is localization to a subset of space-time
sheets for which the eigenvalues of the p-adic density matrix are degenerate. This means that the
time evolution by quantum jumps corresponds to hopping in the space of zero modes, which leads to
that part of zero mode sector, where conﬁguration space spinor ﬁeld has largest value. The maxima of
K¨ahler function are excellent candidates for the attractors of the quantum self-organization process.
A more concrete brain level model of feature detection based on the realization of the self-hierarchy
as a hierarchy of Josephson currents frequency-modulating each other perhaps helps to clarify the
abstract general ideas about conscious feature detection.
1. The feature to be detected is represented as a reference supra current ﬂowing in a neural circuit
and weakly coupled to a parallel neural circuit representing the input. When the supra currents
are identical, constructive interference of the Josephson currents ﬂowing between the two circuits
occurs and induces large modulation of the rest potentials of neurons of the circuit and leads to
a synchronous generation of nerve pulses. Synchronous neural ﬁring can start under rather wide
limits depending on the alertness of the neural circuit (how near to the threshold value resting
potential is) controlled by the modulating Josephson currents also.
2. Synchronous neural ﬁring wakes-up subself which starts to self-organize and develops into an
asymptotic pattern representing a mental image about the detected feature. The ﬁnal state
depends only weakly on the initial state of the neural circuit representing self so that genuine
feature detection is in question. For instance, some minimal number of neurons ﬁring in the
neural circuit leads to given ﬁnal state pattern so that the constructive interference of the
Josephson currents need not be maximal.
3. The self-organization parterns in neural circuits deﬁne a population of sub-selves deﬁning cogni-
tive mental images, features. These sub-selves wake-up and fall asleep (even periodically during
their lifetime (after images)). Falling asleep occurs, when the sub-system generates a bound
state entanglement with some other sub-system, and wake-up by a reduction of the bound state
entanglement.
4. Self-organizating neural circuit starts to approach the maximum of ’subsystem’ K¨ahler function
(recall that approximate representability of K¨ahler function as a sum of subsystem K¨ahler func-
tions is probably possible) is accompanied by the wake-up of subself. This corresponds to the
motion of neural circuit in its spin glass energy landscape induced by various neural transmit-
ters inducing short term or long term changes in the synaptic contacts. Thus self-organization
induces also a generalized motor action shifting the position of the neural circuit in the spin
glass energy landscape.
5. Feature detection involves kind of Eureka! experience. Perhaps the subself representing the
mental image about recgonized object remains for some time irreducible and hence does not
possess any subselves (and is in ’enlightened’ state). This could be the situation for some time
until subselves are generated during self-organization and lead to the analysis of of the recognized
feature.
It seems that the presence of an algebraic p-adic-real entanglement with a positive entanglement
negentropy a is a physical correlate for the experience of understanding and Eureka experience. Real

9.4. Quantum computationalism
459
bound state entanglement can give rise to experiences like seeing beauty, feeling truth, and feeling
love. Thus both p-adic and real physics, cognitive and symbolic representations, must be involved.
Cognitive representations realized in terms of p-adic cognitive neutrinos are generated from the real
physics based symbolic representations. The entanglement between cognitive and symbolic would give
rise to the Eureka experience. The need to separate cognitive and symbolic representations from each
other is highly non-trivial implication.
Learning of associations
The second law of associationism states that ideas experienced simultaneously tend to form associa-
tions. TGD suggests two mechanisms for realizing associative learning.
1. The purely quantal mechanism realizes associations in terms of quantum entanglement. This
mechanism would be extremely elegant because super position principle allows huge capacity of
forming associations. Quantum entanglement however seems to associate parts to form wholes
with the ensuing loss of conscious information about parts rather than giving rise to conscious
associations A →B.
One could say that the association in question is spatial rather than
temporal. Note also that quantum entanglement lacks the directional character of association.
It seems that this mechanism is essential for associating various cognitive features at the level
of brain with sensory qualia at the level of sensory organs.
2. In second mechanism the classical neural net type realization is replaced by a process in which
subself wakes up another sub-self. A process in which presynaptic neuron wakes up postsynaptic
neuron and the mental images of these neurons form the association, could indeed serve as
building blocks of our associations.
It has turned out that these mechanisms are actually not mutually exclusive, and that both are
involved with the association mechanism. The TGD based notion of sub-system, relying on the topo-
logical non-triviality of the many-sheeted space-time, makes possible for separate selves (unentangled
systems) to share mental images via the entanglement of their sub-selves. Topologically this corre-
sponds to the following situation. Two selves (say sensory mental image and cognitive mental image)
are realized as disjoint space-time sheets Si, i = 1, 2 and their sub-selves as smaller space-time sheets
Sij glued by wormhole contacts to the space-time sheets Si. When sub-self space-time sheets S1j
and S2k are connected by join along boundaries bonds, the fusion and sharing of these mental images
occurs.
The neural network model for the formation of associations relies on the idea that some states of
the neural net are in a correspondence with the states of the external world. Also the states of diﬀerent
layers of neural net have natural mutual correspondence. Association basically creates one-one map.
In neural net models the interaction with external world occurs via driving force and dissipation
leads to asymptotic states, which can be interpreted as association of net-states with the states of
the external world. The problem of the neural network models is how the learning process could be
realized in living brain. In particular, how two simultaneous ideas represented by the substates of
neural net get associated with each other. This seems to require that the presence of two active nodes
present in the net tends to strengthen their mutual coupling. There is a lot of empirical supports
for this and neural transmitter action is an essential element of this process. In TGD framework this
process corresponds to the gradual movement of neurons and brain in their spin glass energy landscape
induced by neural transmitter action.
In TGD framwork the formation of association A →B would mean that the stimulus A alone can
generate B. This means that the subself representing mental image A tends to wake up the subself
representing mental image B. At the neuronal level this simply means that the ﬁring presynaptic neu-
ron excites postsynaptic neuron so that it also ﬁres: the long term changes of the synaptic connection
promotes this ability. At the level of our mental images the waking up process must involve nerve
pulse transmission from neural circuit representing subself A to the neural circuit representing subself
B. Josephson current model suggests that during learning period, when A and B are experienced
simultaneously, they are mapped to reference currents in feature recognition network A + B. Later
when only A serves as input, part A of the circuit A + B begins to ﬁre when it receives A as input.
If the synaptic connections between circuits A and B have been strenghtened during learing period,

460
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
the ﬁring spreads out to B and also B wakes up. This in turn leads to the self-organization process
generating experience A + B.
Many associations are bi-directional: for instance, symbols for real world objects are bi-directional
associations. In TGD framework one can model the generation of the bi-directional associations in
classical sense along following lines. Denote by A and B the symbols to be associated: A and B
correspond to subselves of say self X. Neural net philosophy suggests that A and B should co-operate
to keep each other in wake-up state (alive!): self-organization by quantum jumps could lead to this
kind of co-operation. This is achieved if sensory experiences stimulate automatically co-operative
self-populations, whose members tend to keep each other awake. This model is consistent with the
fact that associations do not involve conscious thought. For instance, A could generate nerve pulse
patterns waking up B and vice versa. Note that at the next level of the self hierarchy this could be
regarded as a formation of self-association X →X possibly giving rise to a stable short term memory
and also as survival of self X guaranteed by co-operation of subselves.
9.4.3
Computationalism and TGD
Computationalism in strong sense (brains as deterministic machines) does not emerge from TGD.
The basic reason is that the time concept is totally diﬀerent from that of computationalism. One can
say that quantum jumps select between diﬀerent time evolutions and the overall-important modular
structures result from self cascades.
How computationalism and TGD approach diﬀer?
A good example is provided by vision discussed in [J105] . Vision builds representation or description
of the world from sensory data. Since inverse optics is not possible, implicit assumptions about the
structure of the external world are necessary. Typically illusions rely on the breaking of these implicit
assumptions. Illusions are not always undesirable. Two-dimensional pictures are an example of an
illusion making possible visual communication! Auto-stereograms [J105] consisting of diﬀuse soup of
points are a particularly striking example of illusion: looking the picture for a suﬃcient time, one can
experience a dramatic reshapening of the experience: beautiful 3-dimensional picture emerges from
the chaos. Auto-stereograms support the hypothesis that vision involves computational activities or
quantum counterparts of them. This process can be seen as a school example about how brain adds
to a pure sensory input symbolic and cognitive representations.
In TGD universe brain does not probably deduce the representation of the world from picture by a
straightforward computation. Certainly the data and implicit or learned assumptions about the world
appear as an input in some sense. Some kind of iterated guessing based on implicit assumptions seems
to involved: guess is made and compared with the actual picture. Quantum self-organization indeed
makes possible the iteration, being in itself an iterative process. Guesses are very probably based on
the existing abstract data about possible conﬁgurations of the world. The paradigm of 4-dimensional
brain allowing to realized long term memoryes as geometric memories could be crucial in this respect.
One can wonder whether the implicit assumptions might also develop from temporal entanglements
with larger selves (during sleep) giving rise to information about world in longer length and time
scales.
Control of motion is second good example of what might happen.
There is no deterministic
program proceeding with respect to geometric time and selecting what happens next and creating
the quantum history step by step. Rather, the entire pattern of motion is selected by the creation
of the main program self by quantum jump. The subsequent quantum jumps occur in the cascade
proceeding in top-to-bottom type manner to shorter spatial and temporal scales.
Thus the main
program corresponds to, say the pattern of large scale motion, and sub-programs correspond to the
details of the motion. What is new as compared to computationalism is that the program is created
while it runs.
At the level of CNS anatomy sensory perceptions and motor actions loook mirror images of each
other. TGD suggests that they could be mirror images at much deeper level. Motor actions would
be time reversal of sensory perception in appropriate time scales for MEs (topological light rays,
”massless extremals”) and routinely involve breaking of the second law in this p-adic time scales. This
assumption implies that motor action results like a painting starting from a rough sketch. Dissipation
and its time reversal automatically perform Darwinian selection leading quantum jump by quantum

9.4. Quantum computationalism
461
jump to the ﬁnal motor action. No detailed planning is needed. Motor imagination is motor action
starting from some level above the muscles and motor skills can be learned by imagining them.
Real selves as symbols
The ability to think in terms of symbols is certainly one of the key features of intelligence.
The
hierarchical structure of selves within selves and the possibility of cascades creating selves within
selves allows to interpret subselves of self as conscious representations for symbols, at least under
certain additional conditions. The condition seems to be that symbol subself and the primary subself
representing the real object must be able to wake-up each other bi-directionally. Symbol self and
’real self’ could also belong to diﬀerent levels of the hierarchy. For instance, single neuron could serve
as a representative of neuron group in the sense that neuron and neuron group can wake-up each
other. Perhaps Grandma neuron serves as a symbol for a complicated experience of entire neuron
group. Linguistic associations would certainly be subselves representing this kind of representative
function very eﬀectively. This kind of symbol neurons would correspond to leaders at the level of
human society. Indeed, words can generate actions and word selves are excellent candidates for the
leaders of the neuronal society!
Selves allow also other interpretations. In very general sense they can be identiﬁed as agents or
’demons’ in the sense of computationalism. Agents can be also regarded as counterparts of submodules
of main program.
The call of subroutine from main program could be regarded as a wake-up of
subprogram self. The main program forms automatically abstraction of the entire subjective history
of subprogram self. The input data of submodules realized as subselves is most naturally realized as
sensory input. For instance, neurons are expected to have chemical senses making communication
between neuronal selves possible [K28] . Nerve pulses provide obvious candidate for a communication
mode.
The concept of global workspace [J28] is one of the basic concepts used in the modelling of cognition
and short term memory. The model visualizes short term memory as a global workspace, kind of
common blackboard seen by various agents. The agents in turn can add write data to the global work
space. Communication via global workspace is clearly analogous to mass media. Communication
via global work space could be realized as chemical communication. Hormonal system could be an
example of mass media operating at the level of our conscious experience. A surprisingly large volume
of brain is free of neurons and glial cells and there is experimental evidence for chemical communication
occurring via this free volume [I29] . In TGD framework global work space could be also realized in
terms of coherent photons if selves act as quantum antennas able to receive and send messages: this
would be very much like mass media in neuronal and subneuronal length scales.
Wholes and parts, classes and individuals
Wholes contra parts and classes contra invividuals are basic concepts of computationalism and should
allow representation as quantum level concepts.
Also in TGD framework these concepts emerge
naturally. The subselves Xi of self X are individuals and a natural hypothesis is that X experiences
Xi as separate subselves. The self Y at the next level of hierarchy containing X in turn experiences
the set {Xi} of subselves of X as an average ⟨Xi⟩, typical representative of class X. For instance, if
subselves of X represent diﬀerent faces, then Y forms abstraction about the concept of face.
’Whole’ is a concept diﬀerent from class.
A good example of ’whole’ is letter F formed from
smaller F:s. Whole is something more than a sum of invididuals and the problem is to understand
how this whole is represented at quantum level. A very natural hypothesis is that the whole formed
by subselves is formed by quantum entanglement between subselves leading to the disappearance of
the invidual subselves. When entanglement is destroyed, subselves or some of them are experienced
as separate: this mechanism could also be regarded as a quantum mechanism for the formation of
associations. Sensory experiences would wake up sensory selves involving sensory organ and parts of
brain giving rise to diﬀerent representations of sensory data and the analysis of sensory experience
would involve the decomposition of these selves to subselves.
Our body consciousness provides testing ground these ideas.
Contrary to the basic dogma of
neuroscience, in TGD framework the fundamental representation of the body is formed by the body
itself as is clear also on basis of the concept of self. Of course, representations at the level of brain are
also involved and make possible the analysis of the body experience. We do not however experience

462
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
our bodies as a huge number of separate cells. The explanation is that our subselves correspond to
structures that are much larger than cell. Various parts of our body could obviously correspond to the
subselves of our self. The fact that we recognize all parts of our body as such suggests that our self
is at least as large as our body or perhaps even larger. Interestingly, in some brain disorders patient
does not admit that some part of body, say left side of the body, belongs to them. This would suggest
that the self of these persons is reduced to the self of the other side of the body rather than that of
entire body.
Predictions and memories
The paradigm of 4-dimensional brain (and of 4-dimensional body and even of 4-dimensional Uni-
verse!) diﬀerentiates between TGD based computationalism and classical computationalism. One
of the most important predictions is the possibility of two kinds of memories: geometric ’memory’
generating simulations of past and future and subjective memory making it possible to have genuine
memories about previous moments of consciousness. The comparison of the predictions with what
actually happened seems to be basic activity of conscious mind. The fundamental realizations of both
subjective and geometric memory elegantly circumvent the memory storage problems encountered in
the computationalistic approach and multiplied by the combinatorial explosion.
These basic memory types allow several realizations. The identiﬁcation of immediate short term
memories as subjective memories is very natural. Geometric memories seem to be the only reasonable
candidate for long term memories. Procedural memories relying on association of say nerve pulse
patterns with experiences are possible.
Self at a given level of hierarchy forms automatically abstractions about the wake-up periods
of the lower level selves. This makes possible to form abstractions about the time development of
subselves and to gain wisdom given by experience. Long term memories involve both the formation
of abstractions as some kind of time averages and detailed information. This is diﬃcult to realize in
the neural network approach.
Boolean logic and logical deductions
One can easily invent models of logical reasoning but probably the most realistic model is based
on representing the premises of the logical deduction using Boolean statements realized in terms of
cognitive (that is p-adic) neutrinos. These cognitive representations are transformed by p-adic-to-
real transition to symbolic ones, and generate a neural activity representing the logical deduction
which is basically realized using learned associations. The outcome is represented again in terms of
cognitive neutrinos. Thus only the inputs and outputs of the deduction process are represented in
terms of cognitive neutrinos (this must be so since the experience of understanding requires p-adic-
real entanglement with a positive entanglement negentropy). This model involves minimum amount
of p-adic physics, is essentially isomorphic with the model of imagination, and is consistent with
neuro-science facts.
An interesting possibility is that many particle states of cognitive neutrino pairs providing rep-
resentation of logical thoughts could replicate. This might be possible. If the macroscopic phase
determined by cognitive neutrino pairs is compeletely ﬁxed by the structure of mindlike space-time
sheets then the replication of the material space-time sheet and mind-like space-time sheet would lead
to the replication of thought. DNA replication seems to occur in too short length length scale to be
associated with this process. Cell replication could however quite well involve replication of thoughts.
Cell replication does not seem to occur at the level of brain. Presumably nerve pulses generating
standardized patters of cognitive neutrino pairs have replaced direct decay of cell as a more eﬀective
manner to replicate thoughts and eventually even communicate them.
Beliefs and desires
Computational approach does not have much to say about emotions. Beliefs and desires are however
concepts allowing symbolic (one might say computational) representation: this of course does not
explain what gives for belief or desire its emotional content.
Beliefs could be very generally regarded as basic axioms of formal system from which various
deductions by truth preserving symbol manipulations are obtained. The mathematical model behind
numerical calculation is a nontrivial example of this kind of belief system. Desires can be realized

9.4. Quantum computationalism
463
in computational science in terms of goals assigned with the initial state. For instance, the desire of
the problem solver is to solve the problem that is get from initial state to the desired ﬁnal state by
applying ﬁxed rules. Initial state could correspond to the assumptions of a theorem and ﬁnal state to
the theorem itself. If it is possible to solve the problem at the level of symbolic representation, the
solution of problem can be mapped to the real world. Beliefs and desires could easily be represented
symbolically in terms of neural activity using associations. A Boolean representation of beliefs could
be in terms of logical statements using cognitive neutrinos or real neutrinos.
It is not so easy to understand what gives rise to the conscious experience of belief or desire. The
geometric time development can be regarded as a prediction of future (and past) whereas ”reality”
corresponds to the subjective time development. The belief about what happens in the future is a
special belief and could be seen as ’memories’ with respect to the geometric time: seeing to the future.
Intention would be the p-adic counterpart of this kind of belief, seeing to the p-adic future. A wide
class of emotions could result from the comparison of the predicted and real. That predicted and real
coincide, could correspond to nearly identical sub-selves able to form a bound state accompanied by
a a period of macrotemporal quantum coherence and a positive emotion like understanding.
The fundamental desire of the subself is to stay conscious, to survive. Cognitive, symbolic, and
Boolean representations would give for the desire of the mental images of the conscious world model to
survive an interpretation as a higher level desire. Also beliefs might be determined to a large extend
by the desire of the sub-selves to survive: giving up a belief means death of the corresponding mental
images and unpleasant mental images are a threat for mental images deﬁning the self model. We tend
to have beliefs which do not threat our ego.
Simple model for problem solving
Problem solving is certainly quite high level cognitive skill. A good test for the proposed scenario is
how simple conscious problem solving could proceed. The basic desire of problem solver is to achieve
the goal given the initial state. Problem solver makes trials and when goal and achieved state are
suﬃciently near to each other problem can be said to be solved. The model for this activity could be
roughly like follows:
1. Goal is represented as a physical state of some subsystem and the basic problem is how problem
solver can compare the result of trial with the goal. It seems that all conscious comparisons must
reduce at fundamental level to the comparisons of geometric and subjective time developments
of some subself. Thus it seems that problem solver self must directly experiences whether the
goal was achieved by experiencing how much the hoped for geometric time development and
subjective time development generated by the trial resembled each other.
2. This approach as such is not practical. Standard computationalism would the comparison of the
result of a trial to the goal necessitates circuit which carries out comparisons. This kind of circuit
is easy to realize. For intance, Josephson junctions could physically realize the diﬀerence between
the result of trial and goal as the phase diﬀerence between weakly coupled superconductors. To
know whether the trial was succesful, problem solver must compare the desire represented by
a binary digit one in geometric memory with the result of comparison represented by a binary
digit having one one or zero in subjective memory. For instance, limbic brain could be the seat
of these binary digits and comparison could occur there.
3. Problem-solver subself generates solution trials. Most naturally this involves quantum jump
leading to decomposition of problem solver self to two subsystems. This decomposition represents
the trial. Good problem solver must be able to generate very many diﬀerent trials: this means
that entanglement entropy is almost constant function of subself generated in quantum jump.
4. Problem solver self performs the comparison. When output is ’No’ problem-solver self generates
a new trial. System must have a Eeureka! experience, when the problem is solved. This is
achieved if ’problem solver’ self is ’enlightened’ when it receives ouput ’yes’ from the comparison
circuit. This means that problem-solver selves begins to make quantum jumps reducing matter-
mind entanglement and does not generate trials anymore.
Note that the Eureka requires a
generation of p-adic-real entanglement with positive entanglement negentropy.

464
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
5. The trials could be representable as p-adic space-time sheets deﬁning the initial states of the
symbolic representation deﬁning the world model and realized as patterns of neural activity based
on association mechanism. Their transformation to real ones would initiate the simulation. Also
this process is very similar to that behing logical reasoning and imagination.
There is no need to add that in reality problem solving is much more complicated procedure! The
above model could however provide insight about the conscious experiences related to the problem
solving.
Quantum computationalism in TGD Universe
Macrotemporal quantum coherence makes also quantum computation like processes possible since
a sequence of quantum jumps eﬀectively binds to a single quantum jump with a duration, which
corresponds to the lifetime of the bound state. Quantum computation like process starts, when the
quantum bound state is generated and halts when it decays. Spin glass degeneracy increases the
duration of the quantum computation to time scales which are sensical for human consciousness. In
case of cognitive quantum computation like processes the quantum coherence is stabilized by NMP.
1. Spin glass degeneracy provides the needed huge number of degrees of freedom making quan-
tum computations very eﬀective. These degrees of freedom are associated with the join along
boundaries bonds and are essentially gravitational so that a connection with Penrose-Hameroﬀ
hypothesis emerges.
2. Bio-systems would be especially attractive candidates for performers of both non-cognitive and
cognitive quantum computation like processes. The binding of molecules by lock and key mech-
anism is a basic process in living matter and the binding of information molecules to receptors
is a special case of this process. All these processes would involve new physics not taken into
account in the standard physics based biochemistry.
3. The possibility of cognitive quantum computation like information processing forces generalize
the standard quantum computer paradigm also because ordinary quantum computers represent
only the lowest, 2-adic level of the p-adic intelligence. Qubits must be replaced by qupits since
for algebraic R−Rp entanglement two-state systems are naturally replaced with p-state systems
and for Rp1 −Rp2 entanglement with p1×p2 state systems. For primes of order say p ≃2167 (the
size of small bacterium) this means about 167 bits, which means gigantic quantum computational
resources. The secondary p-adic time scale T2(127) ≃.1 seconds basic bit-like unit corresponds
to M127 = 2127 −1 M127-qupits making about 254 bits. The idea about neuron as a classical
bit might be a little bit wrong!
4. It might be more appropriate to talk about conscious problem solving instead of quantum
computation. In this framework the periods of macrotemporal quantum coherence replace the
unitary time evolutions at the gates of the quantum computer as the basic information processing
units and entanglement bridges between selves act as basic quantum communication units with
the sharing of mental images providing a communication mode not possible in standard quantum
mechanics.
The progress taken place in quantum TGD during the period 2005-2010 allows to add to this
picture several new elements.
1. The hierarchy of Planck constants and identiﬁcation of ordinary particles at magnetic ﬂux tubes
with arbitrarily large value of Planck constant as dark matter leads to the vision about DNA
and nuclear and cell membrane acting as topological quantum computer with the braiding of
ﬂux tubes deﬁning the space-time correlate for the quantum computation [K23] . The intronic
portions of genome are natural candidates for the parts of genome specialized to quantum
computation like activities and for these purposes the exact nucleotide content of the DNA
sequence is not crucial so that DNA looking like ”junk” is not junk from the point of view of
quantum computation.

9.4. Quantum computationalism
465
2. Zero energy ontology brings in naturally the 4-D ensemble of quantum computations assignable
to sub-CDs of given CD. The classical correlates for quantum computations are 4-D classical
ﬁeld patterns assignable to space-time surfaces inside CDs. Causal diamonds bring in the time
scales of 1 ms and .1 s associated with quarks and leptons, which are also the time scales of nerve
pulse activity and of memetic code. This supports the view that dark quarks at the ends of
magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting DNA nucleotides and the lipids of the cell membrane are indeed
the key element of computation.
3. In the intersection of real and p-adic worlds negentropic entanglement is possible. This stabilizes
qubits but makes them fuzzy. This requires reformulation of topological quantum computation
in terms of the U-matrix characterizing U-process for zero energy states and restricted to the
states with negentropic entanglement.
9.4.4
How brain builds the model of the external world?
What we experience is not completely determined by the sensory data: a lot of computation like
processes at the level of cortex is involved. In TGD generation of symbolic representations would
perhaps be more appropriate term. The phenomenon of illusions, most importantly, our ability to
see planar pictures as 3-dimensional, shows that this computation involves a model of external world
based on deﬁnite assumptions [J105] . Stereo vision [J105] is a good example of a sensory experience
involving a lot of cognitive processing at the level of cortex. Depth cannot be experienced directly
and the deduction of the actual positions for the points of the visual ﬁeld must involve large amount
of cognitive processing carried out in cortex. At the level of conscious experience the fusion of right
and left visual ﬁelds to single visual ﬁeld seems to be responsible for the emergence of the 3-D visual
experience.
That complicated information processing is involved is demonstrated by autostereograms, in which
a chaotic set of points experienced as a planar picture organizes to a beautiful 3-dimensional picture
after intensive concentration (all subject persons are not able to see the 3-dimensional picture). It is
known that stereo vision develops in age of few months at the same time when some cortical neurons
specialize to receive input from only single eye instead of superposing the inputs from both eyes. Brain
is also able to estimate the state of motion of objects of visual ﬁeld from sensory data and this must
involve a lot of computation. The fact that some people cannot experience motion in the visual ﬁeld
provides a support for the claim that this experience is a result of a complicated neuronal processing.
At ﬁrst, the computational aspects of the conscious experience would seem to be in conﬂict with
the idea that sensory organs are the primary sensory experiencers. The situation is however not so
simple as the closer examination of the computational aspects of the visual experience demonstrates.
The basic point is that brain quantum entangles to the sensory representation various symbolic and
cognitive representations giving meaning to what is sensed.
TGD based view about construction of sensory representations
The motion of eye or head does not induce the sensation that the world is moving although the
sensory image moves around the cortex. Rather, brain acts like a (possibly moving) canvas at which
the sensory input is projected and monitored by an external observer. This very simple observation
is a strong objection against the idea that the ultimate sensory and cognitive representations reside
inside brain, and leads to the view that the magnetic ﬂux tube structures associated with the primary
and secondary sensory organs deﬁne a hierarchy of sensory and symbolic representations outside brain.
Magnetic ﬂux tube structures would serve as the sensory canvas to which sensory images are projected
from brain and possibly from sensory organs and even neurons. MEs serve as projectors and place
coding by magnetic transition frequency associated with ME wakes-up sensory subselves at various
positions of magnetic ﬂux tubes having varying thickness and associate thus various sensory qualia
and even more complex attributes to the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld. Thus the experiencer would
the complex containing so called material body and hierarchy of ﬁeld bodies.
EEG MEs correspond to our level in this hierarchy of projections. The simplest possibility is that
the sizes of these sensory selves are of the order of EEG ME sizes (L(EEG) = c/f(EEG)) and thus
can be of the order of Earth size! Thus the ultimate sensory representations are magnetic gigants in
TGD and diametrical opposites of the neurophysiological dwarfs of standard neuroscience populating
also TGD brain.

466
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
The known strange eﬀects of large scale perturbations of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld on consciousness
(say, statistics about the eﬀects of magnetic storms in mental state and tectonic activity inducing UFO
experiences) provide a rich palette of anomalies supporting this view. The conservation of magnetic
ﬂux makes the magnetic ﬂux tube structures of Earth size very stable: thus physical death presumably
means only that our magnetic body redirects its attention to something more interesting. Near death
experiences discussed in more detail in [K12] indeed support this view. Of course, this view about
human consciousness is not new, it is shared by all spiritual practices. What is new is the concrete
physical model realizing this view physically.
It would seem that the generation of the visual experience involves some kind of iterative compu-
tational process laeding to an optimal conscious sensory representation of the external world. This
process must involve a model of the external world, which is improved iteratively. Each computational
step must provide an estimate for the various positional coordinates of the object and features associ-
ated with it and a subsequent comparison of the real sensory data with the virtual sensory data yielded
by the model world. The virtual world sensory input yielded by this model is compared with the real
world sensory input in comparison circuit and when virtual and real inputs are suﬃciently near each
other synchronous neural ﬁring leading to a wake-up of sensory subself and conscious recognition of
the object of the perceptive ﬁeld occurs. This could also involve intermediate cognitive, symbolic,
and sensory representations not conscious to us who see only the ﬁnal product of this process. In
case of vision the model suggests that both eyes yield actually stereovision separately in ordinary
circumstances. This might be the case: one must hold second eye closed for suﬃciently long time
before the picture gradually ﬂattens.
This quasi-computational process is cognitive process involving imagined sensory, motor and
Boolean representations (’this is true’ experiences) realized. If the primary qualia are at the level
of sensory organs it is easy to understand why imagination lacks the sensory qualia. Only during
dreams and hallucinations would the back-projection to the sensory organs occur and ”qualiafy” the
symbolic representations generated by imagination. Imagination involves p-adic-to-real phase transi-
tions transforming p-adic space-time sheets to the initial value nerve pulse patterns serving as symbolic
representations and initiating an associative simulation. The genuinely p-adic aspect of imagination
would be thus analogous to the free choice of initial values in a computer simulation. If motor actions
is a geometric time reversal of sensory perception in relevant p-adic time scales, motor actions are
initiated at some level above muscles and proceed to higher levels so that there is no danger that
real motor actions are generated. Dissipation and its time reversal implying a Darwinian selection of
mental images are probably the basic tools of imagination and problem solving: second law becomes
an ally rather than an enemy. Problem solving and motor actions quite generally start from a rough
sketch and there is no need for rigid and bureucratic program structures as in case of AI. Program
develops as it runs.
There are several information sources at use when cortex deduces the positional coordinates for the
objects of the perceptive ﬁeld. In case of vision the decomposition of the right and left visual ﬁelds to
objects is an essential element of the approach. For instance, simple estimate for the distance of object
results from the comparison of the positions of the images of object in the retina. If illumination is
constant, the comparison of the intensities of the reﬂected light coming from various planar pieces of
the surface representing object gives estimate for the normal direction of the planar piece. Also the
fact, that some points of the object are not seen simultaneously by right and left eye can be used as
a constraint. In case of autostereograms there is no decomposition into objects and the problem is to
identify, which points of the right eye and left eye correspond to same point of the external world: the
color of the points is obvious clue. Also long term memories about objects seen earlier are obviously
involved.
In the simple situation that the visual world consists of simple objects, no comparison of the model
world with the real world is needed provided that cortex is able to perform some simple arithmetics
(which is not at all obvious!). In the general situation experience is yielded by the iterative computation
like process (actually a rather long sequence of quantum computations if single quantum computation
lasts about 104 Planck times).
A possible model for the computational aspects of sensory experience
The mind-like space-time sheets in the regions of cortex and various brain nuclei could see each
other in the illumination provided by the Bose-Einstein condensed photons propagating along axonal

9.4. Quantum computationalism
467
(possibly also microtubular) wave guides. This would make possible comparison circuits in which
inputs from two diﬀerent areas of brain to area of brain are compared. The comparison circuit based
on Josephson currents is ideal for this purpose. In case that inputs are identical, synchronous neural
activity results. The comparison of the images could be crucial in realizing the iterative evaluation
of the computational aspects of sensory experience. This iterative comparison process need not be
conscious to us.
From our point of view brain seems to generate only symbolic representations.
Cortex might
however also generate virtual world sensory experiences at lower levels of the self hierarchy and not
conscious to us. These could be compared with the genuine sensory input in (say) thalamus and
convergent iteration would lead to a resonant ﬁring and conscious experience of recognition. This
would explain the observed adaptive resonance phenomenon in which thalamo-cortical feedback loop
directs conscious attention to those aspects of sensory percept which agree with the expectation.
Direction of attention would mean generation of a sensory subself representing the recognized part of
perceptive ﬁeld. Novelty detection could occur at higher information processing level and could be
based on inhibitory projections from feature detectors to the novelty detecting neural circuit.
Just to concretize the idea, one could imagine the following rough scenario for how the comparison
involving neuronal sensory qualia (not ours) could proceed.
1. Neurons in some parts of brain, most naturally in the thalamus, have neural window to the
primary sensory organ radiating coherent light propagating along microtubular waveguides to
thalamus. Besides vision and perhaps even hearing, neurons would also have chemical senses and
receptor-transmitter complexes would deﬁne diﬀerent qualia. Diﬀerent sensory modalities feed
diﬀerent regions of thalamus with diﬀerence wavelengths characterizing the sensory modality
so that the neuronal window based on coherent light might be used by all sensory modalities
to achieve this comparison. This is consistent with the fact that microtubuli are present in all
axons. There is an intensive feedback from cortex to thalamus and this feedback could quite
generally be related to the cognitive representations generated in cortex and communicated to
thalamus for comparison. The results of the comparison are sent back to the cortex coded in
nerve pulse patterns and change the properties of the model world to give a better ﬁt.
2. The imagery model world consisting of neuronal mindlike space-time sheets in cortex represents
the results of a cortical computation. Mind-like space-time sheets radiate coherent light with the
intensity determined by the model of the external world specifying the intensity of the reﬂected
light from a particular object. The simplest possibility is that the representation consists of
mind-like space-time sheets whose size and shape are deduced from the size and shape of the
objects and from the estimated values of the height function. Only the active cortical neurons
send coherent light along microtubules to thalamus. The result of the comparison is coded to
nerve pulse pattern and sent back to cortex to make possible next trial.
Connection with the observations of Barbara Shipman
There is also an interesting connection with the model the model of Barbra Shipman for the dance of
honeybee [A21, A20, A19].
1. The model relies on the puzzling observation that the manifold F3 = SU(3)/U(1) × U(1)
parametrizing diﬀerent choices of color quantum numbers seems to be involved with the dance
[K28] . In TGD framework color rotations do not leave classical Z0 and em ﬁelds invariant
although induced K¨ahler ﬁeld is color invariant. For instance, in a color rotation a pure Z0
ME is in general transformed to a ME carrying a lightlike vacuum em current generating a
hologram possibly acting as a biological control command. This suggests an explanation for the
observations of Shipman and also that the canonical coordinates (Pi, Qi) for the 6-dimensional
symplectic space F3 play crucial role in the construction of sensory representation. In fact, in
Shipman’s model the Hamiltonians associated with color isospin and hypercharge take the role
of planar coordinates for the dance ﬂoor at which the dance of honeybee takes place. More
generally, it might be possible to represent the position of the object of a perceptive ﬁeld using
some coordinates of F3. The optimal situation would be that both the velocity and position
would be coded to a point of F3 so that CP2 orientation of space-time sheet would represent
position for an object of a perceptive ﬁeld.

Holographic brain and quantum TGD
Brain as a hologram paradigm states that one cannot locate the information in brain in any
speciﬁc region. There is indeed considerable empirical support for this hypothesis [J104, J78,
J110] .
9.5.1
Evidence for holographic brain
The ﬁrst empirical motivations for holographic brain came from the experiments of Lashley [J78]
with rats. Psychologist Karl Lashley started 1920 lifelong study of the eﬀect of brain vaults in
memory. Lashley studied the behaviour of rats in mazes and found that the reduction of the
brain tissue did not destroy the visual memory of rats totally, only the intensity of the memory
was weakened. This led to the introduction of the terms mass action and equipotentiality. Mass
action says that the intensity of the memory depends on the amount of the brain tissue present
and equipotentiality says that each neuron carries the memory traces.
The experiments of
Lashley lead to the idea that the memory storage mechanism in brain is nonlocal and hologram
like.
In 1948 physicists Dennis Gabor discovered the idea of optical hologram and within twenty
years the same principles had been applied to brain. What hologram stores is the information
about both amplitude and phase of incoming light wave, quantum mechanically identiﬁable
as the order parameter characterizing coherent light.
What makes holographic information
storage so attractive is its extreme robustness and ﬂexibility: a small piece of hologram carries
same information as entire hologram, albeit in blurred form. Philip Westlake [J137] was one
of the ﬁrst mathematicians to argue that hologram priciple matches with what brain does with
the information. Karl Pribram [J110] and colleagues have done a lot of experimental work with
monkeys using the holographic theory to see in detail how the theory makes it possible for brains
to remember. The book ’Shuﬄe brain’ [Pietch] popularizes in an enjoyable manner the idea of
holographic brain and the work Pietch with salamanders.
The experimental work of Pietch
provides rather convincing experimental support for the idea of holographic data storage [J104]
. The experiments of Pietch with salamanders involved the cutting the brain of the salamander
to pieces, shuﬄing the pieces randomly and putting them back together: no detectable changes
in the behaviour of salamander occurred as a result of this operation! It is hard to imagine a
computer which would function after this kind of treatment.
Holographic data storage is extremely ﬂexible and stable. Since brains have developed in jungle
rather than in safe computer laboratory, these properties make the idea of holographic brain
much more attractive than the paradigm of computer brain.
Also transformations between
sensory modalities are easily realized. For instance, acoustic holograms can be transformed to
optic holograms. One can however also invent objections against holographic data and memory
storage.
(a) The creation of hologram is based on the interference of a reference beam of light with
the beam of light reﬂected from the object. The reading of the hologram is done by using
reference beam to regenerate the original picture. It is however not clear whether this
kind of mechanism is possible to realize at the level of brain. Furthermore, in reality it is
the real beam which stimulates memory recall rather than the hypothetical refence beam!
It seems that comparison of reference pattern representing the expected experience with
input is what happens in brain rather than illumination of holograms.
(b) In order to have holographic memory, it should be possible to code very many holograms
simultaneously to single hologram. Multiple holograms are indeed possible [J104] . One
must however admit that the idea about storing large number of temporal events to same
multiple hologram does not look very attractive.
The identiﬁcation of the long term
memory as geometric memory solves these problems in TGD framwork so that hologram
idea could survive as a a restricted principle determining how the experience is generated.
(c) The structure of the human brain suggests that data representation is not completely
hologram like. For instance, the various phonemes are recognized by well deﬁned regions

9.5. Holographic brain and quantum TGD
469
located in linguistic areas of the brain like potatoes in the ﬁeld. The diﬀerences between
right and left brain are a challenge for the hologram idea in its simplest form. One must
however notice that it is brain functions that are localized whereas data storage could
quite well be hologram like. Of course, it could quite well be that brain decomposes into
regions in which data represented as a hologram is diﬀerent: for instance, diﬀerent sensory
modalities seem to use diﬀerent regions of brain. In particular, the existence of various
sensory homunculi in brain is consistent with the holographic data representation.
9.5.2
Three explanations for the hologram like properties of brain
The fact is that brain seems to be extremely ﬂexible and this does not ﬁt nicely with the idea
that brain is some kind of extremely complicated electronic circuit. Hologram like data storage
in which each neuron is like a part of hologram provides only one explanation for the empirical
data. The common feature of TGD based explanations is that conscious experience is not so
strongly dependent on the neurophysiogical state of the neural substrate as the vision about
brain as a computer would suggest.
(a) Quantum self-organization implies that systems self-organize to dynamical patterns which
do not depend very much on the initial state. For suﬃciently simple brains, whose presence
is not absolutely crucial for the ’household’ activities of the organism, this could be all
that is needed. For instance, the ability of a lizard to generate a new head supports this
view. Salamanders are simple creatures and the mere quantum self-organization without
recourse to hologram memory could explain the results of the experiments of Pietch.
(b) TGD based model of conscious brain relies on self hierarchy realized in terms of various
Josephson currents forming a master-slave hierarchy. Josephson currents do not depend
very strongly on the material substrate of brain. Josephson currents and associated supra
currents allow also basic wave like phenomena like interference crucial for hologram model.
Comparison circuits formed by weakly coupled super conductors and constructive interfer-
ence of Josephson currents provide a quantum model of brain which resembles hologram
model but also diﬀers from it in certain crucial aspects. In particular, reference ray is
replaced by reference current representing expected experience. Also comparison circuits
in which parallel supra currents of same intensity ﬂow in coupled superconductors, are
possible. In this case large Josephson net current is generated by constructive interference
of Josephson currents when the phases of supra currents diﬀer by a constant phase.
(c) It might be that brain is indeed hologram like in some sense although reference rays are
probably not involved. In TGD framework it seems to be possible to abstract from the
hologram idea its essentials, namely the fact that a piece of hologram is like a small window.
This makes it possible to circumvent the most obvious objections against the idea.
i) The essential feature of the hologram is that a small piece of a hologram acts like a
window. The visual experience is not changed much even when one perceives through a
small window. Hence one could give up the assumption that brain prepares holograms.
Rather, one could consider the possibility that neurons see part of the same sensory scene
through neuronal windows. Seing would be made possible by some ﬁeld like quantity whose
values would be determined by its sources in the same nonlocal manner as electromagnetic
ﬁeld is determined by its sources. Sources could be either objects of the external world or
of model world generated by sensory experience, constisting perhaps of mind-like space-
time sheets. Massless ﬁelds are especially attractive alternative since the form of the wave
is preserved during propagation. Hence coherent photons generated by so called massless
extremals [K55] assumed to be associated with the linear structures like microtubules
contained inside every axon, are especially promising as a tool of neuronal vision.
ii) TGD framework provides extremely general mechanisms of subjective and geometric
memory corresponding to actual memories and expectations for what will happen and
possibly happened. In principle it is possible to avoid memory storage completely. The
experiments of Lashley could be understood by assuming only that the sensory data are

470
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
experienced through neuronal windows. Thus there is no need to store memories in multiple
holograms and even holograms are un-necessary.
All boils down to the idea of neural
window and TGD based quantum model of memory.
iii) The existence of sensory homunculi is not in conﬂict with the holographic data represen-
tation. What happens is that single neuron sees part of the perceptive landscape through a
window. Each neuron could be specialized to particular task, such as recognizing whether
particular feature is present in the the sensory landscape. This would involve simple com-
parison circuit making possible feature recognition perhaps involving neuronal wake-up.
Feature recognition could rely basically on the generalization of Haken’s theory [K69] .
9.5.3
From holographic brain to neuronal window?
The notion of neural window
All sensory experiences should reduce to representations generated by zero modes, in particular
zero modes characterizing classical K¨ahler ﬁeld, which can reduce to pure electromagnetic (vi-
sion?) or Z0 ﬁeld (auditory experience?). If the primary or secondary stimuli generate K¨ahler
electric ﬁelds proportional to the gradient of the intensity one can understand the generation
of the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld.
If the gradient is strong, as it is on the boundary of
the image of the object, the conservation of the K¨ahler electric ﬂux forces the generation of
mind-like space-time sheet at which part of the ﬂux goes. Thus secondary sensory organ would
automatically create representation for the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld as mindlike space-time
sheets, which in turn could give rise to selves representing objects of the perceptive ﬁeld as
mental images.
The idea that parts of brain automatically form a model for the objects of the external world
as mind-like space-time sheets suggests an interesting connection with the holographic model of
brain [J104] and with micro-tubules as quantum antenna hypothesis [K55] .
(a) If mind-like space-time sheets are massless extremals, they act as quantum antennae and
generate coherent photons. Axons contain microtubules and this leads to ask whether
these axons could serve as wave guides for the coherent light generated by the mind-like
space-time sheets representing the objects of the external world. Also the vacuum cur-
rents associated with these microtubular massless extremals could code the intensity of
the coherent light emitted by the mind-like space-time sheets. If either of these guesses
is correct, axons provide neurons with a direct sensory window to the representation of
the external world formed by the mind-like space-time sheets residing at sensory organs.
Coherent photons would also give rise to neuronal lingua franca realized as a direct neu-
ronal/microtubular vision.
(b) Sensory window would be in question in a rather literal sense. The fact that a piece of
hologram provides the representation given by the entire hologram, albeit in a somewhat
blurred form, is essentially equivalent with the possibility to see through a small window.
Therefore the idea about neuronal window is in accord with the holographic model of
brain [J104, J110] , which is based on the idea that all neurons receive more or less the
same sensory input, analogous to the visual experience generated by a piece of hologram.
Clearly, coherent photons would serve as kind of mass media at the level of brain.
(c) What is interesting is that the decomposition of the neuronal vision to a large number of
diﬀerent views represented by small groups of light sensitive neurons could even help to
build monocular stereoscopic vision since much more information would be used about the
visual ﬁeld.
(d) Music metaphor provides a considerable restriction to the neuronal window idea. The
Bose-Einstein condensed photons should correspond to single frequency equal to some
cyclotron frequency. Thus it would seem that the sensory input of single neutron is yes/no
type. The neuronal window however makes however still sense for neuronal groups: in this
case the input would be determined by light and dark pixels. Various nuclei or brain could
thus have neuronal windows to cortex and other nuclei of brain.

9.5. Holographic brain and quantum TGD
471
Neural window and imagery
Mental imagery is something which is diﬃcult to understand in the framework of the standard
neuro science. There are empirical results suggesting that mental images correspond to patterns
of activity inside cortex, which are three-dimensional and continuous so that neural activation
provides a concrete recognizable image about object [J105] . Rather remarkably, also imaginative
thought resembles very much visual imagery as is clear from the fact that language is full of
visual metaphors [J105] . It is also known that imagery uses same regions of cortex as real
sensory experience and the problem is to understand why there is genuine sensory experience
involved with imagery.
In the framework of the standard neuroscience the obvious question is why the pattern of the
imagery activity is not accompanied by a direct sensory experience. Also the boundary between
direct sensory experience and imagination is sometimes problematic: for instance, in the state
between sleep and awake, sensory images often enter into mind. During dreams one can have
sensory images and eidetic memory is essentially sensory memory. I have a personal experience
about extended state of consciousness, or rather whole-body consciousness (this experience ac-
tually made me consciousness theoretician!). During this state I could see my thoughts as vivid
visual images and had also peculiar odour and taste experiences also reported to occur dur-
ing mystic experiences. Could the correct interpretation be that thalamus, cortex and sensory
organs temporarily formed a larger self during this experience?
If one accepts that sensory qualia are at the level of sensory organs and neural activity only
builds symbolic and cognitive representations, it is easy to understand the diﬀerence between
imagination and sensory perception. Sensory imagination is sensory perception without sensory
qualia. Quantum entanglement between sensory organs and cortex and TGD based view about
long term memory resolves the obvious objections against this view.
This does not exlude the possibility that neurons have chemical senses and even see and hear.
Neurons would not only contribute to our experience. Neurons able to perceive sensorily would
be probably much more eﬀective information processors than neurons which are blind and deaf.
Therefore the notion of neuronal window could be useful metaphor in the modelling the neuronal
basis of the mental imagery. For instance, the understanding of processes like rotation of an
imagined object of visual ﬁeld provides an exciting challenge. The rotation of mind-like space-
time sheet should induce the rotation of the region containing nerve pulse activity. Neuronal
window idea suggest that the imagined rotation of the object involves virtual sensory experience
generated in the somatosensory- auditory-visual association region of the neocortex (note that
only humans have these associatin regions). This region would be able to form representations
of the basic objects of the perceptive ﬁeld and manipulate them. The imagined rotation of the
object could occur here and would be observed by the primary sensory regions.
Sensory perceptions involve a lot of computation like processing at the level of cortex (consider
stereo vision as an example), which can be naturally identiﬁed as imagination yielding succes-
sive models for the external world as consisting of familiar objects. Both the imagined world
represented by the mind-like space-time sheets inside cortex and the mindlike space-time sheets
in the sensory organ could be seen by the secondary sensory organs in thalamus and compared
to see whether the imagined world yields the same sensory input as the real world. The result
of the comparison would be fed back to cortex as a nerve pulse pattern serving as a feedback
modifying the model.
Neuronal window and blind sight
The phenomenon of blind sight [J125] suggests that there is kind of a Zombi within us [J25] ,
which can see but that this vision does not give rise to a conscious vision. Typically persons who
have blind sight can grasp the object of the visual ﬁeld once they have been told that it contains
the object. The Zombi within us seems to be much more rapid and reliable than the conscious
’I’ in its responses but it seems to be much less ﬂexible. It also seems that Zombi within us
cannot be cheated by illusions unlike conscious ’I’, which suggests that much less theorizing and
pattern recognition is involved. Rapid responses of Zombies within us are certainly consistent

472
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
with the fact that cortical processing is not involved. Nonﬂexibility would be the price paid for
the reliability and absence of higher level cognitive processing.
One can imagine many models for Zombi within us and probably there are many of them (and
they are actually not Zombies at all!).
(a) Thalamus projects sensory data to amygdala which is often called brain inside brain, or
emotional brain. Amygdala would thus have neuronal window to to thalamus and could
give rise to unconscious-to-us mental activity responsible also for the blind sight. Also the
sensory perception at the level of retinae might be enough if one assumes that primary
sensory qualia are at the level of sensory organs.
(b) Formation of the symbolic representations for the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld could
occur also in the thalamic nuclei.
(c) The decomposition of the perceptive ﬁeld to objects could occur for the ﬁrst time already
at the level of retina and the coherent light from the mind-like space-time sheets provides
a representation of the visual ﬁeld seen by neurons of thalamus, whose regions serve as
secondary secondary organs identiﬁable Zombies within us (Zombies only from our view
point!).
9.5.4
Possible evidence for the neuronal window idea
To ﬁnd whether the neuronal window based on coherent light hypothesis could make sense, it
would be important to eliminate the eﬀects of the higher level information processing. This
requires the study of simple organisms having primitive sense of vision. There is indeed exper-
imental support for identifying the coherent states of photons as associated with vision. It is
known that some monocellulars possess elementary vision based on the microtubules [I5]. The
emergence of the multicellulars during the Cambrian explosion was preceded by the appearance
of the microtubules. If the emergence of the microtubules meant the emergence of the visual
consciousness in the length scale of the cell, then the formation of the multicellulars as cell
societies can be understood as a natural consequence.
The length distribution of the microtubules in the rods and cones of the eye is concentrated
in the region of the visible wavelengths. The coherent light in question could be identiﬁable
as bio-photons of Popp [I38]. The architecture of retina is ’wrong’ from the engineering point
of view. The ganglial axons feeding sensory input to brain are in front of the retina. This
is in accordance with the TGD based model of vision in which the photons of incoming light
Bose-Einstein condense on the ganglial axons and amplify the signal to the thalamus.
A further piece of evidence comes from the work of Callahan about the sense of smell of insects
[I10] . Many insects, such as moths and ants, are known to be attracted by light, say candles
and electric lamps and Callahan took as his challenge to understand what is involved. Callahan
discovered that insect’s olfaction is not based on chemistry (alone) but to a maser like emission
of infrared light generated by various molecules such as pheromones, scent molecules and many
other biomolecules. Insects see rather than smell the sources of the infrared light. The sensillae
of the insects serve as receiving antennas and amplify the incoming infrared radiation. Callahan
also observed that the oscillation of insect antennae induce maser like emission from scent/etc.
molecules by creating an oscillating emf. Thus sensory experiencing seems to involve active
participation from the part of insect. In any case, the results of Callahan suggest that coherent
light could be important also in our neuronal sensory experiencing.
The infrared light emissions from pheromones mediate sexual messages in case of insects. Quite
remarkably, pheromones are known to mediate sexual and social signals also in case of many
mammals. For instance, certain chemical messages from a female mouse can make male mouse
to mate immediately while certain chemical messages from other males make him agrresive.
Many mammals, for instance rodents, are known to possess vomeronasal organs, small cigar
like sacks containing neurons and having length of order few millimeters [J3] , giving rise to an
accessory olfactory system, which is known to have much more primitive structure and to work
in diﬀerent way than the ordinary olfactory system. It is also known that this systems bypasses

9.5. Holographic brain and quantum TGD
473
cerebral cortex in rodents. There is evidence that even humans have the ability to sniﬀcertain
chemicals mediating social and sexual signals without being aware of it and there is already
now an entire perfurme industry based on this evidence. The chemicals giving rise to sexual
attraction are probably pheromones. The fact that pheromones mediate sexual signals in case
of both insects and mammals, is hardly an accident and suggests that the sensory mechanism
must be the same and be based on the infrared emissions by phreromones. If the response is at
neuronal level and if the cortex is not involved, one could understand why these messages are
not experienced consciously. One could test this hypothesis by ﬁnding whether coherent infared
radiation at frequencies emitted by pheromones can aﬀect the behaviour of higher mammals
including humans.
There is a further peculiar co-incidence: the cascade of transduction events occurring in the
absorption of photon in retina is repeated in a remarkably similar way in olfactory receptor
cells, which respond to odours whereas the receptor cells that respond to sound use a very
diﬀerent system [J3] . Could this mean that also the experience of odour primarily involves the
detection of (also) infrared light so that humans would not basically diﬀer from insects or that
olfactory system has evolved from the receptor neurons originally sensing infrared light? This
would conform with the idea that the K¨ahler ﬁeld generated in ear corresponds to classical Z0
ﬁeld, which does not generate coherent photons but couples with neutrinos. One must however
notice that the resemblances between visual and linguistic imagery suggest that some part of
ear generates cognitive representation based on coherent light and experienced by the secondary
sensory organs in the thalamus.
9.5.5
Massless extremals as quantum holograms
It took long time to really understand what MEs really and along with this understanding came
the vision about precisely how MEs could act as holograms and what biological functions these
holograms could correspond to. It indeed seems that massless extremals (MEs) are perhaps the
most fundamental solutions of the ﬁeld equations as far as TGD inspired theory of consciousness
is considered. What is important is that MEs play both the roles of quantum gravitational
holograms [B7] and dynamical holograms [B9] .
The hologram principle of quantum gravitational theories roughly states that the quantum the-
ory in space-time with boundary reduces to a conformal quantum ﬁeld theory at the boundary.
If K¨ahler action were deterministic, precisely this would happen. The construction of the con-
ﬁguration space geometry relies crucially on the assumption that the complications due to the
non-determinism of K¨ahler action do not radically modify the picture resulting assuming com-
plete determinism.
It has indeed turned out that the basic construction in which everything to the lightlike boundary
of M 4
+ (moment of big bang) acting as a hologram in quantum gravitational sense and deﬁning
conformal quantum theory, generalizes.
The basic construction survives as a template of a
more general construction in which also the lightlike boundaries of MEs having always lightlike
M 4
+ projection are taken into account besides δM 4
+ as surfaces at which initial values can be
prescribed arbitrarily.
This brings in also time eﬀectively absent in a strictly deterministic
theory. The quantum gravitational hologram deﬁned by δM 4
+ is replaced by a fractal structure
formed by δM 4
+ and Russian doll hierarchy of the lightlike boundaries of MEs inside MEs. The
super-symplectic and superconformal invariances of the lightlike boundaries generalize in an
elegant manner on basis of the basic properties of MEs.
There are good reasons to expect that the lightlike selves deﬁned by the boundaries of MEs are
fundamental in TGD inspired theory of consciousness. The super-symplectic quantum states
associated with the lightlike boundaries are genuine quantum gravitational states deﬁned by
conﬁguration space spinor ﬁelds, whose dependence on conﬁguration space ﬁber degrees of free-
dom does not reduce to mere vacuum functional, and therefore do not possess any quantum
ﬁeld theoretic counterparts. They are state functionals in the world of worlds, so to say, and
therefore should represent highest level in the hierarchy of quantum control in living systems.
MEs carry lightlike vacuum currents. In passive state these currents are Z0 currents whereas in
active state, obtained by a color SU(3) rotation, the current is electromagnetic and generates

474
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
coherent state of photons. One can say that the lightlike current provides a dynamical variant
of the diﬀraction grating deﬁned by the ordinary static hologram. This leads to a model of
living matter in which the coherent states of ordinary photons and colored conﬁguration space
photons act as control commands. Their phase conjugates (time reversals) in turn correspond
to the time reversed commands. What is especially beautiful is that simple reference wave can
activate arbitrarily complex hologram acting as a control command. This provides new visions
about healing by time reversed reference waves forcing the biological program responsible for an
illness like cancer to run backwards in time. One can also construct a general theory of sensory
representations based on MEs [K64] . To sum up, it seems that the hologram principle is they
key element of brain and biological functioning but in a sense somewhat diﬀerent from what it
was believed to be by the pioneers.
9.5.6
The notion of conscious hologram
The notion of conscious hologram is the last step in the development of ideas related to bio-
holograms. The basic challenge is to generalize the notion of the ordinary hologram to that of
a conscious hologram, about which bio-holograms would be examples. The notion of quantum
gravitational hologram is deﬁned at the level of geometric, purely physical existence whereas
conscious holograms exist at the level of subjective existence deﬁned by the sequence of quan-
tum jumps and giving rise to the self hierarchy. Of course, these two notions of hologram must
be closely related.
The notion of conscious hologram combines the saint and sinner aspects of consciousness to single
concept: macrotemporal quantum coherence due to the generation of bound state entanglement
and giving rise to co-operation on one hand, and the dissipative self-organization giving rise to
Darwinian selection and competition on the other hand.
In nutshell, the notion of conscious hologram follows from the topological ﬁeld quantization.
Classical ﬁelds and matter form a Feynmann diagram like structure consisting of lines repre-
senting matter (say charged particles) and bosons (say photons). The matter lines are replaced
by space-time sheets representing matter (elementary particles, atoms, molecules,...), and vir-
tual bosons are replaced by topological light rays (”mass-less extremals”, MEs). Also magnetic
ﬂux tubes appear and together with MEs they serve as correlates for bound state quantum
entanglement.
The classical ﬁelds associated with MEs interfere only at the nodes, where they meet, and one
has a hologram like structure with nodes interpreted as the points of a hologram. Thus one
avoids the loss of information caused by the interference of all signals everywhere. This aspect is
crucial for understanding the role of em ﬁelds in living matter and brain. The MEs corresponding
to ’real photons’ are like laser beams entering the hologram and possibly reﬂected from it. What
is new that the nodes can be connected by ’virtual photon’ MEs also analogous to laser beams.
Hence also ’self-holograms’ with no laser beam from external world are possible (brain without
sensory input).
The hologram has a fractal structure: there are space-time sheets at space-time sheets and high
frequency MEs propagating eﬀectively as mass-less particles inside low frequency MEs serving as
quantum entangling bridges of even astrophysical length. The particle like high frequency MEs
induce ’bridges’ between magnetic ﬂux tubes and atomic space-time sheets at the receiving end.
This makes possible the leakage of supra currents from magnetic ﬂux tubes to atomic space-time
sheets analogous to the exposure of ﬁlm producing hologram. The leakage induces dissipation,
self-organization, and primitive metabolism as a cyclic ﬂow of ionic currents between the two
space-time sheets, and thus a Darwinian selection of the self-organization patterns results. Under
certain conditions the leakage followed by dropping back to the larger space-time sheet can also
give rise to a many-sheeted laser. The low frequency MEs are responsible for the bound state
entanglement, macroscopic quantum coherence and co-operation whereas high frequency MEs
are responsible for self-organization and competion.
The 3-D vision associated with ordinary holograms generalizes to stereo consciousness resulting
in the fusion of mental images associated with the points of conscious hologram [K8] .

Four-dimensional fractal brain as an associative net
The identiﬁcation of brain as 4-dimensional fractal associative net seems to provide a promising
paradigm for the understanding of brain functioning. The associative net structure and mere
real physics considerations are certainly not all that is needed. p-Adic physics as physics of
cognition means that fundamental cognitive representations correspond to p-adic space-time
regions, and, needless to say, in this respect huge amount of work remains to be done in order
to build connections between theory and observations. In the following only the real physics
aspects of brain as an associative net are considered.
9.6.1
Brain as an associative net
The notion of associative net suggests a general paradigm making it possible to understand
brain functioning. The subjective time development of an associative net consists of experiences
representing associations A →B.
In case of brain associative net is a network of neurons.
”A→B” association is made possible because the emission of synaptic vesicles implies that
postsynaptic and presynaptic neuronal space-time sheets form a connected space-time sheet.
A is represented by the various presynaptic inputs and B corresponds to the output of the
postsynaptic neuron. A and B can correspond to various sensory qualia or Boolean statements
represented in terms of memes which in turn decompose into sequences of codons consisting of
126 binary digits and represented in terms of cognitive neutrino-antineutrino sequences. Memetic
codons could also have interpretation as binary representations of integers providing quantitative
measures for qualities. In Boolean case associations are experienced as logical implications ”If
A then B” is true. A and B can represented arbitrarily complicated statements composed of
elementary statements. Neuron receives the conclusions of postsynaptic neuron as premises and
feeds its own conclusion as premises to its own postsynaptic neuron.
Self-organization by quantum jumps selects gradually the allowed ”A →B” correspondences
as asymptotic self- organization patterns. Quantum self-organization and quantum statistical
determinism suggest a natural Darwinian selection of the memes caused by the dissipation in-
side self and completely analogous to protein folding. The correspondences A →B would be
determined by chemical macro variables characterizing the state of the neuron and chemical
transmitters would play a crucial part in the learning of the responses. Syncronization is nec-
essary for the function of the network. Emotional control can modify the associations ”A→B”
in long time scale (conditioning and desensitization): for instance, some conditions belonging to
premises A of Boolean association drop away or B can change.
9.6.2
4-dimensional fractal brain
One needs two additional principles in order to have vision about brain a la TGD.
(a) Brain is 4-dimensional in well-deﬁned and very restricted sense. This follows from the
classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action. Self-organization by quantum jumps replaces
the classical space-time surface repeatedly with a new one and the ﬁnal result represents
classically the activity as it would be detected by a compeletely mechanical instrument.
One can say that the classical time development describing say sensory experience, long
term memory, motor activity or logical thought is gradually reﬁned by starting from a
rough sketch and making successively ﬁner corrections iteratively.
The process is like
making a painting stating from a rough scetch. The four-dimensionality of the brain and
diﬀerence between subjective and geometric time is absolutely essential element.
(b) Fractality is second element. The successive reﬁnement process proceeds from long to short
time and spatial lenght scales. Thus large and slow neural circuits correspond to rough
sketches and small and rapid circuits to small details. Small circuits are simultaneously
active (in sense of subjective time) in the entire space-time region deﬁning the duration of
the activity. Thus again the 4-dimensionality of brain is crucial.

476
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
The notion of associative net suggests a very general view about how brain functions and gives
rise to conscious experiences. Brain itself is a huge associative circuit but decomposes into more
or less autonomous subcircuits.
9.6.3
Sensory experiences, logical thinking, associations and simula-
tions
The notion of associative net allows readily to understand what happens in sensory experiencing,
logical thinking, formation of associations and imagination
(a) Sensory representations are formed by an iterative process involving comparison which
takes also care about the computation of unknown data such as distances of the objects
of the perceptive ﬁeld. For instance, various cortico-thalamic loops could be related this
process. The updating of the zero modes of the sensory inputs from sensory organs is
performed in the thalamic neurons receiving real sensory input from the sensory organ and
expected sensory input from cortex. An automatic comparison process possibly realized at
quantum level in terms of two weakly coupled super conductors is in question [K57, K58] .
This process involves also the concentration of attention to speciﬁc features of the sensory
experience.
(b) Neuronal input represents in general case several sensory modalities and conscious output
single sensory modality or ’Boolean quale’ represented by memetic codon. Thus associative
circuits can represent the formation of associations in associative regions of brain. Note
however that pre- and postsynaptic neurons in principle represent always an association
at the neural level and neuronal associations are basic building blocks of ’our’ associa-
tions involving entire groups of neurons and entire neural circuits. Also the formation of
associations is very probably an iterative process.
(c) The circuits of the associative net provide an ideal realization for predictive simulations
of type A →B →.... in terms of various kinds of sensory qualia. This makes possible
imagination.
The diﬀerence with respect to the standard neural net is that conscious
neuron represents some sensory modality or Boolean modality: this makes the simulation
”real” and assigns meaning to nerve pulse patterns: note that the generation of meaning is
basic problem of the neural net models of consciousness. This kind of simulation circuits
are expected to be related with frontal lobes and to be crucial for the planning of the
future activities. Motor circuit involving basal ganglia, thalamus and prefrontal cortex is
also a possible example of this kind of circuit. Again iteration bringing in more and more
details to the motor plan is involved.
(d) Logical deductions do not diﬀer from simultation in an essential manner: the only diﬀer-
ence is the replacement of the temporal causation by logical causations. In case of logical
deductions premises and conclusions are coded to memetic codons represented by cogni-
tive neutrino pairs. Much of our logical thinking might be actually habitual and almost
deterministic deduction sequences associated with circular loops and unconscious to us.
Logical consistency is thus not guaranteed and, unless the brain of a ideal mathematician
is not in question, and results only from the logical consistency of the external world.
9.6.4
Formation of long term memories
Associative circuit give rise to learning of long term memories. Short term memories correspond
to reverberating nerve pulse patterns in closed circuits giving rise to a repetition of the same
component of experience again and again. In Boolean case periodic association sequences rep-
resented by closed loops A →B →...A correspond to tautologies. Reverberating memories are
remembered with high probability if long term memories are realized as geometric memories.
The reason is that there is high probability for a randomly generated cognitive space-time sheet
in geometric past to reside on the region occupied by a reverbarating loop. Repetition is the

9.6. Four-dimensional fractal brain as an associative net
477
manner to learn.
It is rather plausible that Nature has discovered eﬀective learning in this
manner and there are indeed circuits associated with long term learning.
A quite recent ﬁnding in neuroscience is that during the learning of spatial tasks hippocampus
and some other parts of brain generate long spike sequences. Typical interval between spikes
varies between 1-2 milliseconds. This would mean that a sequence of 126 spikes would correspond
to .1-.25 seconds which is of the same order of magnitude as the duration of our self identiﬁed
as the duration of immediate sensory memory. Also long term memories are constructed as kind
of artworks or charicatures.
9.6.5
Planning and realization of motor programs
Associative circuits are associated with planning and realization of the motor programs.
(a) Motor activity is the reverse of sensory experiencing in a well-deﬁned sense. The imagined
motion of the object in the working memory representing perceptive ﬁeld is transformed
to the motion of the real world counterpart of the object so that motor organs are like
puppets bound to axonal strings and moved by the little man in the brain. The perceptive
ﬁeld, where imagined motion occurs is located in the frontal cortex with primary motor
cortex excluded. Several copies of the perceptive ﬁeld providing diﬀerent representation of
the perceptive ﬁeld are probably involved as ’working memories’. These working memories
are formed by topographical maps between diﬀerent parts of brain.
(b) Planning of the motor action is almost motor action: the only diﬀerence is that the last
stage when nerve pulse patterns characterizing the motion are fed to motor organs is not
performed. Plan is essentially four-dimensional pattern of nerve pulse activity.
(c) The ability to realize plan seems to require that it is memorized: this would require that
the performance of the motor activity is repeatedly imagined and ﬁnally allowed to occur.
Thus the nerve pulse activity representing plan becomes a periodical nerve pulse pattern
and the actual motion starts when the coupling to primary organs is turned on. As a matter
fact, 4-dimensional brain allows to give up the assumption about reverberation. Also the
activation of a motor plan in the geometric past could be possible! This would be consistent
with the results of the experiments of Libet about active aspects of consciousness: what
was observed that neural activity started before the conscious decision to raise index ﬁnger.
The relevant time scale would be of the order of second. Of course, an interesting question
is whether adult person could initiate in the geometric childhood a motor action aﬀecting
dramatically the geometric present, say leading to traﬃc accident! This possibility would
seem to lead to paradoxal looking consequences.
(d) Learning of a motor skill presumably means that motor plans very rapidly self-organize
to their ﬁnal shapes. Learned skills correspond to motor plans which are winners in the
Darwinian selection associated with self-organization.
(e) The realization of the motor plan requires initial value sensitivity and muscles indeed
provide an excellent example of an initial value sensitive system in which single nerve
pulse generates macroscopic motion.
Motor action is planned and performed as a four-dimensional pattern.
Construction of the
motor plan means that four-dimensinal virtual perceptive landscape is gradually deformed into
the desired shape. Motor activity can be seen as a fractal top-down process analogous to the
construction of a space-time fractal: fractal classical determinism of K¨ahler action is absolutely
crucial for this and 1/f noise [K58] is one of the consequences of the fractality.
The non-
determinism of the p-adic diﬀerential equations is very probably a direct correlate of the classical
non-determinism of the K¨ahler action.
Macroscopic motor activity starts from a rough 4-dimensional sketch of motion which is gradually
reﬁned to the ﬁnal artwork and possibly memorized to represent a reverbarating structure. The
sketch and its various reﬁnements are represented at the virtual perceptive landscape of the
premotor cortex. More concretely:

478
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
(a) First a large quantum jump realizing in rough sense the motor action occurs (for instance,
hand grasps the object): this corresponds to certain classical time development starting
in geometric past on new space-time surface. This stage corresponds to the activation of
slow and large neural circuits with time scale characterizing the entire motion. This is like
construction of the ﬁrst sketch of a 4-dimensional fractal representing motor plan.
(b) After this a cascade of smaller scale quantum jumps adding details to the motor plan
occur: this is like adding further details to a four-dimensional fractal. The neural circuits
involved are smaller and faster. Addition of details takes places in the entire time interval
T of the geometric time associated with the full motion. This involves multitime moments
of consciousness so that also neural circuits are active in the geometric interval deﬁned by
T.
9.6.6
Language
Memetic codons represented as temporal sequences of 126 binary digits should be the basic
building blocks of the linguistic consciousness. The value of single binary digit is represented at
the neural level by the presence/absence of nerve pulse and at the level of cognitive conscious-
ness by the direction of the spin of the cognitive antineutrino. Boolean interpretation is not
necessary: the interpretation of the sequences of 126 bit as integers providing quantitative mea-
sures for, say the intensities of the sensory experiences, is also possible. The proposed quantum
models for the quantum correlate of hearing and for Boolean mind [K52, K28, K31] suggest that
sound frequencies are mapped to Z0 magnetic cyclotron frequencies of ions whereas thinking
corresponds to Z0 magnetic cyclotron frequency which is above the range of the audible sound
frequencies. This supports the idea that memetic codons are as such experienced as some kind
of internal speech and also that only certain brain regions allow Boolean mind: the generation of
cognitive neutrino pairs indeed requires strong axonal Z0 magnetic ﬁelds which could be present
only in the postsynaptic axons of the associative regions of cortex.
The diﬀerences between right and left brain suggest that the output axons in the associative
regions of left brain represent information using cognitive neutrino pairs whereas the correspond-
ing axons in the right brain hemisphere could represent information in terms of Z0 cyclotron
frequency varying above the audible frequency range (left brain talks and right brain sings!). If
audible frequencies are involved, Josephson frequencies must be suﬃciently far from cyclotron
frequencies so that right brain imagines of hearing the thoughts rather than actually hears them.
Unless higher harmonics of the cyclotron frequency are used (which is quite possible!), this re-
quires parallel mode of representation since music metaphor suggests that the Z0 cyclotron
frequency of the axon is not variable.
Language circuits would be involved with the translation of the Boolean statements to linguistic
expressions coded eventually to motor activities yielding speech. This process is only special case
of a motor activity and thought as an internal speech is like a motor plan. Language represents
one possible realization of the memetic code analogous to the translation of DNA sequences
to proteins. It is instructive to look what contraints the memetic code poses on the general
structure of language. The ﬁrst empirical fact is that the meaning of the linguistic experience
is insensitive to the local variations in the speed of speech. In particular, the repetion of a
phoneme is usually interpreted as providing no additional purely linquistic information. On the
other hand, the linguistic meaning of speech is determined by its purely local structure.
These facts are consistent with the hypothesis that phonemes are the basic codons of speech
having ﬁxed duration and that a repeated phoneme has the same linguistic meaning as single
phoneme. This supports the identiﬁcation of the phonemes as representations of the memetic
codons: phoneme would thus represent single linguistic subself. By the previous estimate the
duration of the memetic codon should have duration in the range .1 −.25 seconds. A more
precise estimate comes from the detailed model for the physical realization of the memetic code
and from the model of nerve pulse [K31, K62] : the resulting estimate for the duration of the
memetic codon is about .14 seconds.
The facts that a frequency f ∼10 Hz represents the
fundamental frequency associated with speech organs and that 20 Hz frequency represents the

9.7. Connection with the neuro science view about brain
479
lower limit for the audible frequencies are consistent with the identiﬁcation of the phonemes as
linguistic images of the memetic codons.
Note that cognitive neutrino pairs of duration of order one millisecond are not experienced as
separate components of conscious experience if time averaging is involved with temporal binding.
This is consistent with the fact that language does not contain any smaller consciously experi-
enced constituents than phonemes. Not that speech represents (very-!) many-to one expression
of the menetic code (faithful coding would require language with 2126 diﬀerent phonemes: this
gives good idea about the present evolutional level of human culture!). Genetic code is not
unique and some cell organelles, such as mitochondria, possess their own genetic code. Various
languages could correspond to diﬀerent translations of the memetic code to nerve pulse patterns
in turn coded to motor activities representing expressions of language. The Mersenne prime
2127 −1 could be clearly re-christened to be the number of Babel!
9.7
Connection with the neuro science view about brain
In the following an attempt to formulate a connection with the brain as it is seen in neuroscience
is made. Learning is basic aspect of intelligence and the discussion concentrates on this aspect
of intelligence.
9.7.1
A simple model for cognition
The hierarchy of selves and summation hypothesis allows to construct a very general model
for cognitive processes including as a special case thinking, analysis of visual experience, and
language. In nutshell: cognitive process could be regarded as cascade like process leading to
a generation of selves followed by generation of sub-selves for these leading to... . Quantum
jump becomes the building block of cognition and thought but is not suﬃcient alone. p-Adic
space-time sheets as correlates of cognition provide geometric correlates for thoughts, intentions,
plans, etc.. are a fundamental element of cognition. The intersection of real and p-adic worlds
understood as partonic 2-surfaces allowing an interpretation in both real and p-adic sense and
the intersections of real and p-adic partonic 2-surfaces consisting of rational and common al-
gebraic points deﬁne cognitive representations. Negentropic entanglement is possible only in
the intersection in accordance with with the vision that cognitive representations carry the
information.
Quantum criticality of TGD and existence of selves
The model of cognition provides a new view to the role of quantum criticality of TGD. One
consequence of the quantum criticality could be the existence of a lot of sub-systems which
are near the critical line at which phase transition changing the local topology (real or p-adic)
occurs. TGD universe would be in a state of maximal alertness ready to generate cascades of
selves representing cognitive acts. Our cognitive acts would be only part of the cognitive acts of
the entire Universe proceeding from top to bottom as inﬁnite trees with branches representing
new selves and nodes representing moments of wake-ups for the selves.
Or expressing it in
the terminology of AI: we would be like subprograms of inﬁnite program represented by entire
universe. The presence of higher level selves means that cognitive acts can proceed from the
level of even entire biosystem to the level of DNA. This encourages to interesting speculations:
for instance, the ideas of Sheldrake about learning at the level of species and even biosphere
might ﬁnd justiﬁcation [K69] .
Number theoretical criticality is an important aspect of quantum criticality and is taken to mean
that life and conscious intelligence reside in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds, where
discrete cognitive representations and transformation of intention to action and vice versa are
possible.

Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
Quantum jump as cognitive process
U process followed by a cascade of state function reductions will be identiﬁed as the basic
cognitive act.
(a) State function reduction can be characterized as a binary tree. At each step of the state
function reduction cascade some subselves manage to remain unentangled, some subselves
lose their consciousness by developing entropic bound state entanglement, or experience
expansion of consciousness by entangling negentropically. A particular branch of the pro-
cess stops if subself allows no decomposition to entropically entangled but otherwise free
pieces. What is new is that the entanglement is also time-like and time-like entanglement
turns out to be central for understanding of what happens in learning.
(b) The binary tree of state function reduction has a natural ordering. This ordering need not
have any correlate at the level of geometric time. At the level of subjective time and con-
scious experience the correlate for ordering could exist but if self experiences its subselves
as averages of sub-sub-selves this cascade is experienced only partially by given subself.
One can of course argue that self wakes up in each quantum jump separately and quantum
jump sequence should be seen as a sequence of ”awakenings” (I used this term earlier):
this awakening is however something diﬀerent from the emergence of mental image. Maybe
time-like negentropic entanglement is which binds this sequence of ”awakenings” to a con-
tinuous stream of consciousness that we experience.
(c) The outcome of the state function reduction is random when it leads to un-entangled subself
but statistical determinism implies reliability at the level of ensemble. For negentropic
entanglement state function reduction is nearly deterministic process and in this case one
can speak in reasonable approximation about an iteration of a unitary processes deﬁned
by the powers of U. This iterative process deﬁnes a self-organization process expected to
be also behind learning.
(d) One possible interpretation of the self cascade is as a representation for an abstraction
process representing thoughts about thoughts about... Our poor ability to form statements
about statements about ... would correspond to the fact that self experiences only its sub-
selves directly. Another interpretation is as analysis, in which initial experience gradually
sharpens and gets more and more structured during the decomposition into sub-selves.
Sub-selves could be thought as symbols of language or as logical statements or objects
in picture: interpretation depends on what kind of cognitive process is in question. This
process occurs in several time scales- even in the time scale deﬁned by human life cycle.
The modular structure of cognitive acts is also analogous to the modular structure of a
computer program: starting of subprogram means the reduction of entanglement for the
corresponding subsystem.
One can see this process also at the level of imbedding space correlates.
(a) Selves wake up and begin to perform quantum jumps. The imbedding space counterpart
for self is CD (causal diamond) characterized by time scale coming as powers of two and
is scaling like the value of Planck constant. Subselves correspond to sub-CDs. Wake-up
requires a feed of metabolic energy to destroy the bound state entanglement. Self could be
also created from vacuum or disappear to it in a quantum jump generating a completely
new CD or annihilating it.
(b) Cognitive process proceeds in a cascade like manner starting from the root of tree formed
by CDs and going downwards along the tree choosing at each node some branches. For
instance, understanding of a sentence would correspond to waking up of large self A rep-
resenting sentence in its entirety, words its sub-selves Bi, phonemes to sub-selves Cij of
Bi, etc... waking-up in this order. Similarly, the act of decomposing the ﬁgure to objects
and of objects to sub-objects would correspond to a temporal sequence generating selves
within selves. Negentropic entanglement would be crucial for experiencing both the whole

9.7. Connection with the neuro science view about brain
481
and the parts simultaneously. Background would be the largest conscious self and objects
would correspond to a sequence of selves. Selves Cij and further sub-selves can be gen-
erated before generation of next Ci+1: this should occur in case linguistic mental image:
generation of word self would be followed by the generation of syllables and phonemes and
only after this would next word be generated. Time nonlocality of self experience with
respect to geometric and subjective time would be essential.
9.7.2
Cognition, learning, and negentropic entanglement at the level
of brain
Negentropic entanglement is information carrier and learning is gaining information. Does this
mean that learning takes place automatically in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds? Uni-
tary U-matrix between zero energy states characterizes single step of quantum jump sequences
and for negentropic states the state function reduction is not random process and in the ﬁrst
approximation U N characterizes the outcome of N subsequent quantum jump so that learning
process should be characterized by the iteration deﬁned by the powers of U.
In neuroscience synaptic contacts are believed to be crucial for cognition, learning, and memory
and it is interesting to try to relate this picture to the TGD based vision about conscious
information and learning. How negentropic entanglement could be realized at the level of brain?
Is it time-like, space-like, or both? Can one assign the generation of negentropic entanglement
between neurons to the attachement of neurotransmitter to receptor? Can one relate the general
quantum model of learning to the neuroscience based model of learning relying on the growth
of brain cells, synaptic contacts, and synaptic plasticity?
The picture of the standard neuroscience about learning
It is good to summarize ﬁrst the vision of standard neuroscience about the neural correlates of
learning.
1. Basic notions
Synaptic transmission [J9, J22] is believed to be a key element of brain consciousness. Synaptic
transmission takes place as synaptic vesicles carrying neural transmitter.
Given neuron can
release several transmitters. The transmitter molecules bind to the receptors at the postsy-
naptic cell membrane. Depending on whether this process leads to a depolarization or hyper-
polarization one speaks of excitatory or inhibitory receptors (activation potentials). Since most
transmitters attach mostly to either kind of receptor, one speaks about excitatory and inhibitory
transmitters although this terminology is misleading. Receptors can be classiﬁed to relatively
simple ion channel receptors and more complex receptors involving second messenger proteins.
The belief is that the primary process does not involve communications with genome but if one
accepts the DNA as topological quantum computer picture-in particular, on the existence of
magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting cell membrane and DNA nucleotides- the possibility that these
communications are an essential element of process and that a new kind of gene expression at
cell membrane level is involved. The communication to the DNA could take with light velocity
if massless extremals are involved.
The synaptic strength characterizes the sensitivity of the postsynaptic neuron to the ﬁring of
the presynaptic neuron. It depends on the density of receptors and their activity as well as
the total amount of neural transmitter transferred between neurons determined by the number
of synaptic vesicles transmitted. This in turn depends on the size of the synaptic button. All
these parameters are aﬀected in learning understood as a change of synaptic strengths. It must
be emphasized that learning in this sense should be seen as a neural correlate for conscious
(or unconscious-to-us) learning and possibly of memory. What is essential that the respose of
the postsynaptic neuron changes. This picture relies on the technical assumption that learning
reduces to the changes of synaptic strengths. This assumption is probably an over-idealization:
much more probably happens.

482
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
2. Learning at brain level
Learning in the sense as it is deﬁned above can take place at the level of both anatomy and
physiology. Learning at the level of anatomy can mean growth of new synaptic connections
and of even new neurons. For instance, the growth of new neurons in hippocampus is now
understood to be essential prerequisite for learning. It is believed that the information from the
connections of old neurons is transferred to those of cortical neurons. This can of course happen
but in TGD framework this is not necessary since the new view about time allows to interpret
memory as communications with the brain of the geometric past.
Learning at the level of physiology is known as synaptic plasticity [J20] and involves several
mechanisms. Synaptic plasticity means that the sensitivity of the postsynaptic neuron to the
signals from presynaptic neuron can change.
(a) Sensivity means essentially the probability for the ﬁring as a response to the ﬁring of
presynaptic neuron and this is controlled by the sign and magnitude of the activation
potential and the increase of the sensitivity means a generation of stronger depolarization
or weaker hyperpolarization. Postsynaptic neuron can become more or less sensitive to
the presynaptic neuron whereas presynaptic neuron can send stronger signal by increasing
the number of synaptic vesicles.
(b) The change of the sensitivity of the postsynaptic neuron can take place several mechanisms
[J20] .
i. The ﬁrst mechanism involves the modiﬁcation of protein kinases whose function is
to phosphorylate the receptor which means essentially providing it with metabolic
energy.
The eﬀectiveness of the protein kinases is regulated.
Second mechanism
depends on second messenger neurotransmitters regulating gene transcription and
regulates the levels of key proteins at synapses. Gene expression is aﬀected in this
mechanism and the eﬀect is long-lasting.
ii. Third mechanism aﬀects the number of ion channels (ion transfer between cell interior
and exterior is basically responsible for the activation potential) and is involved with
long term potentiation (LTP [J13] ) and - depression (LTD [J12] ) believed to be
central mechanisms of learning memory. LTP is believed to be of central importance in
hippocampus. The change of the density of receptors is one manner to achieve LPT or
LTD. For so so called AMPA receptors [J4] to which glutamate binds this mechanism
is well-established. Also phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of AMPA receptors
and change in the probability of glutamate release is a decisive factor.
(c) The notion of Hebbian learning [J10] applies to LTP. Hebbian rules summarizes the above
picture as simple mathematical rules allowing computer modelling. When pre-synaptic
and postsynaptic neurons ﬁre simultaneously, synaptic connections are aﬀected.
Weak
stimulations of several pathways add up.
Also temporal summation takes place if the
frequency of ﬁring is high enough. Strong stimulation of one pathway aﬀects also other
pathways. More general formulation of the rules does not require the ﬁring of the postsy-
naptic neuron. For anti-Hebbian learning de-sensitization takes place. Also non-Hebbian
learning is believed to take place.
(d) The change of the postsynaptic action potential need not be the only outcome of learning.
If this were the case, the huge number of neural transmitters and receptors inducing
diﬀerent responses would not be needed. The change of the sensitivity is only one aspect
of learning and as its relationship to conscious learning is unclear.
TGD based vision about cognition and learning
In the following a brief summary about TGD inspired view concerning cognition and learning
in general and at brain level is given.

9.7. Connection with the neuro science view about brain
483
1. Basic ideas
The general ideas about cognition have been also discussed but is useful to summarize them
again.
(a) Subself interpreted as a mental image is key notion. Subselves wake-up, fall asleep, and
fuse together losing consciousness or experiencing expansion of consciousness.
(b) The cascade of state function reductions can be regarded as an analysis leading to a
ﬁnal state in which subselves are either entropically or negentropically entangled systems.
The latter systems can be seen as negentropic mental images resulting as subselves fuse
together. In the case that two sub-selves are involved, the resulting mental image can be
regarded as an abstraction or rule such that the state pairs appearing in the superposition
correspond to the instances of the rule. If one state pair dominates then association in
classical sense is in question in good approximation.
(c) Negentropic entanglement can take place between systems which belong to same or diﬀer-
ent number ﬁelds and gives rise to various kinds of conscious experiences. At least in the
case that the other system is p-adic, negentropic entanglement should be a correlate for
the conscious experience of understanding.
(d) Zero energy states for brain represent rules as pairs of positive energy (initial) and neg-
ative energy (ﬁnal) states. M-matrix characterizes zero energy state and deﬁnes a rule
representing ”laws of physics” at the level of conscious experience. Diﬀerent M-matrices
are orthonormal with respect to each other and in ensemble all of them appear and each
of them can be also regarded as representing one particular instance of a rule.
A new element is that unitary time evolution characterized by U-matrix forces the learning to
occur in the sector of state space containing zero energy states for which positive and negative
energy parts of the states are negentropically entangled. U-matrix and its powers characterize
the learning process. When the states are negentropically entangled, state function reduction
for M-matrix is not a random process but leads to a unique state maximing negentropy and
in a good approximation the restriction of U matrix to these states codes for the evolution of
M-matrix. U N restricted in this manner characterizes the M-matrix after N quantum jumps.
Therefore learning is unvoidable in the case of negentropic states and U N at the limit of large
number of quantum jumps characterizes the learning. The value of N is of course limited by the
size of CD assigned to the learning system. One can of course wonder whether the unitary period
is following by a return to unentagled state via the liberation of metabolic energy associated
with the negentropic entanglement.
The powers of U deﬁne an iterative map and iterative maps are the key element of self orga-
nization and also one of the main tools of generating fractals [K69] . Quantum classical cor-
respondence therefore suggests that 4-D fractal self-organization patterns deﬁne the space-time
correlates for learning.
2. General view about learning at the level of brain
M-matrix for brain codes its view about laws of physics. In diagonal form represents pairing
of initial and ﬁnal states as rules A →B. For instance, in fermionic degrees of freedom these
rules can be interpreted as Boolean rules. More generally, the interaction as quantum associa-
tions containing superposition of instances of the associations are in question. Huge quantum
superposition of rules is possible since the number of neurons large and the information storage
capacity of entanglement increases exponentially with the number of neurons.
U-matrix approximated as a matrix restricted to represent unitary evolution of negentropic
zero energy states assignable to brain provides the ﬁrst principle description for learning as
the sequence of powers U N.
In the models of associative learning learning is reduced to a
local process expressible in terms of changes of the synaptic contacts. This suggests that the
basic building block of U matrix is synaptic transmission. This means an analogy with the
basic braiding operation of the neighboring strands represented as R-matrix deﬁning the unitry

484
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
matrix for topological quantum computation [K23] . There is also an analogy with generalized
Feynman diagrams. The incoming particles would be neurons. Synaptic transmission analogous
to particle exchange between two neurons. U matrix can be regarded as a quantum superposition
over all possible diagrams containing arbitrary number of synaptic transfers. Multiverse picture
at neural level thus results as one might expect since macrotemporal and macroscopic quantum
coherence is involved. If the situation reduces in a reasonable approxiation to a description
in terms of synaptic transfers one can in principle describe synaptic plasticity, LTP, and LTD
and other mechanisms to in terms of the basic building block of U associated with the synaptic
transmission and mathematically analogous to Feynman propagator. The binding to the receptor
could induce communications with genome and also the U-matrix assignable to topological
quantum computations at the DNA level might be involved.
As such this picture provides only a ﬁrst principle formulation for what conscious learning is
and it requires a work to deduce predictions testing this vision or at least to gain understanding
using this vision. A key aspect of negentropic entanglement is that it carries metabolic energy.
This has been already proposed to provide a ﬁrst principle explanation for the notion of the high
energy phosphate bond crucial for the understanding of ATP →ADP + Pi process deﬁning the
key stop of metabolism [K26] .
Also space-like negentropic entanglement is possible for positive (negative) energy parts of the
states. In particular, negentropic entanglement between presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic
genome generated by the attachment of the transmitter to the receptor might make sense. There
is temptation to assign to this connection a magnetic ﬂux tube identiﬁed as a carrier of metabolic
energy released in the process and inducing ionic currents leading to the processes aﬀecting the
synaptic strength as well as the states of neurons involved. The larger the metabolic energy
release is, the more intense are the ionic currents involved and the stronger the modiﬁcation is.
This would provide a ﬁrst principle explanation for why more eﬀective phosphorylazation of the
receptor as a correlate for learning. Of course, the explanation works even without the heavy
conceptual machinery if one is ready to accept the somewhat nebulous notion of high energy
phosphate bond.
9.7.3
Negentropic entanglement and the role of neurotransmitters
Soon after starting to develop TGD inspired theory of consciousness, I somehow ended up to an
email correspondence with Gene Johnson who insistently emailed me links to abstracts about
neuroscience. I read the classic Bible about brain by Kandel et al [J54] and tried to make sense
of it in my own conceptual framework. This was of course hopeless task since I had only the
notions of quantum jump and self. The feeling that something very simple -about which I do not
and perhaps cannot ever have a slightest clue- must be behind this incredible complexity made
the situation really frustrating. The deeper meaning of EEG, nerve pulse neurotransmitters,
hormones- actually of entire brain chemistry and also biochemistry- remained a total mystery.
Development of ideas
After the required number of years however some concrete ideas began to emerge.
(a) The notion of magnetic body with fractal onionlike structure meant a decisive step of
progress. Also the hierarchy of Planck constants and dark matter as controller of visible
matter in living systems emerged. The function of EEG as communication and control tool
of magnetic body using biological body as a motor instrument and sensory receptor looked
very natural. This led also to a proposal that there is an entire hierarchy of EEGs and their
variants. After several trials a vision about nerve pulses as concomitants of quantum level
communications emerged as also a vision about DNA as topological quantum computer
based on the ﬂux tubes connecting DNA nucleotides with the lipid layers of cell membrane
emerged and providing a function for the intronic portions of genome as carriers of quantum
computer programs [K23] .

9.7. Connection with the neuro science view about brain
485
(b) Also a vision about the biochemical role of dark matter evolved. In particular, phase tran-
sitions reducing Planck constant for a magnetic ﬂux tube would induce its contraction and
force biomolecules near to each other. This would explain the miracles of DNA replication,
translation, and transcription and quite generally the processes known as aggregation of
proteins. The reconnection of magnetic ﬂux tubes changing the topology of the biological
Indra’s net would be also a central mechanism.
(c) The model of nerve pulse and the vision about living matter as a kind of dynamical Indra’s
net led to a ﬁrst clear idea about the role of neural transmitters. Transmitters are classiﬁed
to inhibitory or excitatory depending on whether they increase or reduce the magnitude of
the membrane potential. This property is however a property of the receptor rather than
that of the transmitter. The same transmitter can have both excitatory and inhibitory
receptors although often either receptor type dominates. The proposal was that neural
transmitters are associated with the ends of the links of the 4-dimensional web connecting
neurons to each other.
Neurotransmitter attaches to the plug deﬁned by the receptor
connecting the communication wire from presynaptic neuron to the ﬂux tube leading to
the passive portion of postsynpatic DNA strand acting as sensory receptor. This would
make possible rapid communications to DNA. The corresponding active portion of DNA
strand could then respond by generating an activity at the level of cell membrane. This
conforms with the general idea that proteins represent only one particular outcome of the
gene expression. This left open the question whether the excitatory-inhibitory dichotomy
could have some deeper meaning.
(d) Also it became clear the emotions and information are closely related and that peptides
acting both as neurotransmitters and hormones are crucial for emotions [J102] . I proposed
that emotions are ”entropic” qualia. Although I realized the importance of negentropic
entanglement I did not have time or I was not able to realize how far reaching this notion
actually is.
Is genome a fractal counterpart of brain?
Fractality replaces standard reductionism in TGD Universe. An old idea inspired by p-adic
length scale hypothesis is that the binary structures associated with p-adic scales L(k) ∝2k/2
and L(k + 2) deﬁne a fractal hierarchy. Brain hemispheres would represent one example of this
kind of pair, lipid layers ofe cell mebrane second one, and DNA double strand third one. Just for
fun one could assume that the structure and functions of brain hemispheres have fractal analogs
at the level of DNA double strand and vice versa and look what kind of questions this inspires.
(a) Could the identical structures of DNA strands correspond to the anatomical similarity
of right and left brain and could the functional asymmetry of the strands correspond to
the laterizalization of brain function? Could the genome act as the brain of cell? Could
various brain areas have counterparts at the level of DNA? Could the hydrogen bonds
between nucleotides serve as the counterpart of corpus callosum? Could the splitting of
these bonds during transcription and replication correspond to what happens to a split
brain patient?
(b) Before continuing it must be made clear that the global identiﬁcation of right-left di-
chotomy with holistic-reductionistic dichotomy is wrong. One can however consider its
local variant with holism and reductionism assigned do the pairs of right and left brain ar-
eas. For instance, in contrast to the naive rule the emotional right (left) brain (amygdala)
would be reductionistic (holistic,negentropic) whereas the intellectual right (left) would be
holistic (reductionistic,entropic). The practical reason to the division to the entropic and
negentropic pieces could relate to the metabolism. The entropic regions could provide the
binding energy as a usable energy to the positive energy negentropic entanglement. Good
is not possible without Evil! There are no winners without loosers!
Right brain is specialized in spatial thinking and left brain to verbal thinking and arith-
metics: the geometry-algebra division of mathematics! Right brain is not so good in motor

486
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
actions as left brain as any right-handed person knows. Right brain is however better in
tactile sensing: right handed persons tend to use left hand for touching objects to get an
idea about their shape. Also this can be understood in holistic-reductionistic picture.
(c) Apart from reﬂex actions almost all activities of the body seem to be controlled to a
high degree by brain. Could also the activitites of cell be regarded as motor actions of
the genome acting as the brain of cell receiving sensory imput from the cell membrane?
Could one identify the analogs of sensory areas receiving information from cell membrane,
processing, and sending it to the association areas? Could the analogs associative areas
be identiﬁed as intronic portions of DNA performing topological quantum computations
and communicating the outcome to the higher motor areas at the intronic portions of the
of the complementary strand, wherefrom they would be communicated to the primary
motor areas identiﬁable as the regions of DNA expressing themselves either chemically
(RNA and proteins), as activitites generated directly at the level of cell membrane, or
electromagnetically? For instance, could neurotransmitter in the receptor generate the
feed of sensory input to the genome inducing the change of the membrane potential as
the counterpart of motor action. Could prokaryotes without introns be analogous to brain
with only primary sensory and motor areas or to mere ladder-like nervous system?
One could argue that the analogy between DNA are brain fails because second DNA
strand is completely passive whereas both brain hemispheres express themselves via motor
actions. This is not the case! Both DNA strand has regions expressing themselves but
the transcription takes place in opposite directions. Hence DNA strands have motor and
sensory areas as also brain does, and the natural guess is that primary motor areas cor-
respond to the areas expressing themselves in terms of RNA, proteins, and possibly also
as actions at the level of cell membrane. Primary sensory areas would correspond to to
regions complementary to the primary motor regions.
(d) What right brain sings-left brain talks metaphor could mean in this picture? Pitch-rhythm
dichotomy is more technical expression for this dichotomy. Function providing local data
and its Fourier transform providing global data is more abstract representation for this
dichotomy and Uncertainty Principle for momentum and position relates closely to these
two representations of information.
This dichotomy could reﬂect the presence of two
diﬀerent natural time scales and millisecond time scale for nerve pulses and .1 second time
scale for moments of sensory experience are the natural candidates.
If so, this dichotomy could directly reﬂect the diﬀerent time scales assignable to u and d
type quarks (1 millisecond) and to electron (100 ms) and reduce to the level of elementary
particle physics. This dichotomy would also have fractally scaled up variants made possible
by the hierarchy of Planck constants.
The analog of Fourier transform would be the
negentropic unentanglement of sub-CDs (assignable to quarks) to single mental image
inside electron’s CD.
The analog of function itself would be a collection of sub-CDs
representing separate unentangled mental images assignable to individual nerge pulses in
millisecond time scale. Also the topological quantum computations assigned to the intronic
portions correspond to diﬀerent time scales due and reﬂect quark-lepton dichotomy. The
quarks in question could be the quarks assigned to the ends of ﬂux tubes in the model of
DNA as topological quantum computer.
(e) This raises some questions. Could the gene expressions of the two strands somehow reﬂect
this dichotomy? For instance, could the ﬂux tube structures assignable to the aminoacid
sequences correspond to the millisecond and 100 ms scales assignable to quarks and electron
have the property that also the functioning of these proteins is characterized by these
typical time scales? According to [I11] the time scales of protein folding vary from .1 s to
103s. According to Wikipedia [I3] the typical time scale is 1 millisecond which suggests
that the time scales correspond to two ranges beginning from ms and 100 ms respectively.
There are also short proteins for which the folding takes place in microsecond time scales
which might relate to the CD of proton.

9.7. Connection with the neuro science view about brain
487
What can one say about the function of neurotransmitters?
Can one say anything interesting about the function of neurotransmitters if one combines this
highly speculative picture- which can be defended only by the belief on fractality as universal
principle- with the idea that bound state and negentropic entanglement make possible the fusion
of mental images.
(a) Suppose that the fusion of neuronal mental images is required to build higher level men-
tal images that we experience. Suppose that neuronal mental images involve DNA in an
essential manner. Suppose that magnetic ﬂux tubes serve as correlates for the entangle-
ment so that the transmission of nerve pulse from pre-synaptic neuron to post-synaptic
one creates a ﬂux tube connection between neurons possibly extending to the genome of
the post-synaptic neuron. The transmitter at the end of ﬂux tube attached to the receptor
acting as a plug would build this connection to some part of DNA specialized to receive
particular kind of sensory data from a particular region of cell membrane with comple-
mentary strand activating as a response a motor function inducing gene expression at cell
membrane level. Gene expression as build-up of proteins would not be necessary and is
also too slow for neural activities.
(b) Suppose that the entanglement between neurons generated in this process is always negen-
tropic as the interpretation as the idea about neural correlate for a conscious association
suggests. One could also ask whether the neurons could entangled entropically and whether
the entropic-inhibitory association could make sense. This does not lead to anything in-
teresting and entropic entanglement between neurons should be regarded as a pathological
condition. Note that neuron-neuron entanglemement would be naturally time-like and in
this case only negentropic entanglement might be meaningful.
i. To gain some perspective consider the activation of cell in general by some external
perturbation from the resting state to the active state (here I have learned a lot from
email correspondence with Vladimir Mateev) In the resting state the proteins inside
cell are passive -or rather, forced to be passive- as one might expect on basis of the
general vision about homeostasis. The unfolded proteins and unfolded portions of
the folded proteins are connected by hydrogen bonds to ordered water so that the
folding occurring otherwise spontaneously is prevented. One can say that the cellular
winter prevails. The situation is however nearly critical and if external perturbation
occurs cell liberates metabolic energy melting the ice and spring comes. Also the
outer surfaces of globular proteins are hydrogen bonded and when the ordered water
melts, spontaneous melting of the protein takes place leading to a partial unfolding.
The resulting folded proteins and partially unfolded globular proteins interact by
forming aggregates and this activity would naturally involve ℏreducing phase tran-
sitions and ﬂux tube reconnections. In TGD based model the mechanism of both
folding and melting would be the liberation of metabolic energy destroying the hy-
drogen bonds and the energy for this comes from the ATP containing positive energy
negentropic bond between O=s of phosphates.
ii. Similar situation could prevail at the cell membrane.
One can imagine that cell
membrane is like a particle at the bottom of a small potential well. At the other side
there is a deep well representing the generation of nerve pulse and at the other side
a high wall corresponding to hyper-polarization requiring energy. Both polarization
and hyperpolarization are prevented by the freezing of protein activities needed to
induce them. The ﬂux tubes connecting the presynaptic neuron and receptor and
possibly genome are always negentropic and their formation can as such serve as the
signal leading to the partial melting of the ordered water making possible to generate
action leading to either depolarization or hyperpolarization. The signal could be just
the additional metabolic energy making it possible for these transitions to occur.
iii. This picture does not require any communications from the receptor to the genome
and in the simplest situation the resulting action could be seen as the analog of reﬂex

488
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
action. These communications could of course be present and the negentropic entan-
glement could make it easier to induce depolarization also now. Also the question
whether excitatory-inhibitory dichotomy for the receptors has some deeper meaning
apart from taking the neuron nearer to or farther from criticality for ﬁring remains
unanswered.
9.8
Could TGD provide justiﬁcation for the ideas of Ru-
pert Sheldrake?
Rupert Sheldrake [I33] has developed a theory of learning and memory based on the concepts of
morphic ﬁelds and morphic resonance. In the following I describe brieﬂy the theory of Sheldrake
and consider a TGD variant of of the theory.
9.8.1
Sheldrake’s theory
The following summarizes very brieﬂy the basic ideas of Sheldrake’s theory.
(a) The basic hypothesis is that learning occurs also at the level of species. If some individuals
of the species have learned some habit then it becomes easier for the remaining individuals
of the species to learn the same habit. The individuals who learned the habit ﬁrst need not
even live anymore or can live in a distant part of the world. Collective learning is claimed
to occur in a morphic resonance analogous to a phase transition leading from a small
seed of invididuals with new habit to a population having the same habit. Morphic ﬁeld
provides a representation for a habit and resemble the concept of meme in this respect.
Sheldrake states the basic assumptions of his theory in the following manner:
The idea is that there is a kind of memory in nature. Each kind of thing has a collective
memory. So, take a squirrel living in New York now. That squirrel is being inﬂuenced by
all past squirrels. And how that inﬂuence moves across time, the collective squirrel-memory
both for form and for instincts, is given by the process I call morphic resonance. It’s a
theory of collective memory throughout nature. What the memory is expressed through are
the morphic ﬁelds, the ﬁelds within and around each organism. The memory processes are
due to morphic resonance.
(b) Sheldrake deﬁnes morphic ﬁelds in the following manner:
Basically, morphic ﬁelds are ﬁelds of habit, and they’ve been set up through habits of
thought, through habits of activity, and through habits of speech. Most of our culture is
habitual, I mean most of our personal life, and most of our cultural life is habitual. ”We
don’t invent the English language. We inherit the whole English language with all its habits,
its turns of phrase, its usage of words, its structure, its grammar.
(c) ’Alike likes alike’ rule states that learning induces learning only in the members of same
species. This suggests that the morphic ﬁelds correlate strongly with genome.
(d) Sheldrake represents the learning of language as a good example of morphic resonance.
Occasionally people invent new words, but basically, once we’ve assimilated it, it happens
automatically. I don’t have to think when I’m speaking, reaching for the next word. It just
happens, and the same is true about physical skills, like riding a bicycle, or swimming, or
skiing if you can ski, these kinds of things. So I think the more often these things happen
the easier they become for people to learn. Things like learning language have happened
over- well, we don’t know how long human language has been around, at least 50,000
years, so there’s a tremendously well-established morphic ﬁeld for language-speaking. Each
particular language has its own ﬁeld which is usually established over centuries at least.

9.8. Could TGD provide justiﬁcation for the ideas of Rupert Sheldrake?
489
(e) Sheldrake notices also that morphic resonance and morphic ﬁelds are not all what is needed
to understand evolution.
The whole idea of morphic resonance is evolutionary, but morphic resonance only gives
the repetitions. It doesn’t give the creativity. So evolution must involve an interplay of
creativity and repetition. Creativity gives new forms, new patterns, new ideas, new art
forms. And we don’t know where creativity comes from. Is it inspired from above? Welling
up from below? Picked up from the air? What? Creativity is a mystery wherever you
encounter it, in the human realm, or in the realm of biological evolution, or of cosmic
evolution. We know creativity happens. And then what happens is a kind of Darwinian
natural selection. Not every good idea survives. Not every new form of art is repeated.
Not every new potential instinct is successful. Only the successful ones get repeated. By
natural selection and then through repetition they become probable, more habitual.
9.8.2
TGD based interpretation of morphic ﬁelds and collective mem-
ory
I have proposed for more than decade ago a TGD based formulation justifying the basic ideas
of Sheldrake to some degree. The recent formulation involves several new elements. Zero energy
ontology implying that WCW (”world of classical worlds”) spinor ﬁelds allow an interpretation
as memes or morphic ﬁelds, the model for living matter in which the notion of magnetic body
plays a key role, and the model of DNA as topological quantum computer allowing to identify
the morphic quanta relevant for living matter.
WCW spinor ﬁelds
In TGD framework zero energy states correspond to the modes of completely classical WCW
spinor ﬁelds with fermionic second quantization at space-time level having purely geometric
interpretation at the level of WCW. The analysis of the degrees of freedom involved demonstrates
that WCW spinor ﬁelds are analogous to ordinary quantum ﬁelds but hav inﬁnite number of
components.
(a) WCW decomposes to a sub-WCWs association with unions of causal diamonds (CDs).
Individual CD is partially characterized by the moduli deﬁned by the positions of its upper
and lower tips. The proposal is that the temporal distances between the tips are quantized
in octaves of CP2 time scale and thus coming in good approximation as secondary p-adic
time scales for primes very neary to power of two. The most general proposal is that also
the position of the upper tip at proper time = constant hyperboloid of future lightcone
M 4
+ is quantized for positive energy states. For negative energy states this happens to
the lower tip. This disrete set would provide a discretized quantum version of Robertson-
Walker cosmology with discretized lattice like structure replacing the continuum.
The
interpretation would be that lower tip corresponds to the usual Minkowski space-time of
special relativity and the discretized position of upper tip to the space-time of cosmology.
This implies very strong predictions such as the quantization of cosmic redshifts which is
indeed observed [K74] . Similar quantization would take place in CP2 degrees of freedom
for either tip. WCW spinor ﬁelds for single CD would depend on these moduli and for
positive (negative) states one would have wave functions in the space formed by sub-WCWs
with wave function basis consisting of products of plane waves in M 4 with a wave function
in the discrete subset of M 4
±. These degrees of freedom generalize those of a quantum ﬁeld
in Minkowski space.
(b) The notion of generalized imbdding space forces to assign to a given CD a selection of
quantization axis of energy and spin which in the case of M 4 boils down to a choice of
a preferred plane M 2 ⊂M 4 plus a choice of time direction (rest system). In the case of
CP2 the choice of quantization axes of color isospin and hypercharge means a choice of a
homologically trivial geodesic sphere of CP2 plus preferred isospin quantization axes. The
space for possible choices of quantization axis deﬁnes additional moduli. The selection

490
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
of quantization axes in state function reduction means a localization in these degrees of
freedom. The space characterizing the selections of color quantization axis represents an
example of so called ﬂag manifold. It has already earlier appeared in TGD inspired biology
with a motivation coming from the observation of topologists Barbara Shipman that the
mathematical model for honeybee dance leads naturally to the introduction of this space.
Shipman speculated that quarks have some role in biology [A21] . Dark matter hierarchy
indeed makes indeed possible scaled up copies of QCD type theory in biological length
scales.
(c) WCW spinor ﬁelds restricted to a CD with ﬁxed moduli have inﬁnite number of bosonic
and fermionic degrees of freedom. Spin-like degrees of freedom for these ﬁelds correspond
to WCW spinors, which describe many-fermion states consisting of quarks and leptons and
bosons deﬁned as their bound states. This Fock state is assigned to each 3-surface and the
dependence on 3-surface deﬁnes purely bosonic (’orbital’) degrees of freedom, which can
be coded by using a state basis whose elements have well-deﬁned spin and color quantum
numbers. The bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom are super-symmetrically related.
WCW spinor ﬁelds as morphic ﬁelds
The interpretation of the WCW spinor ﬁelds as memes or morphic ﬁelds is encouraged by two
observations.
(a) Zero energy states have an interpretation as Boolean rules A →B as well as self-organization
patterns. Fermion number 1 and 0 for a given fermion mode represents values of one par-
ticular Boolean statement in positive resp. negative part of the state. The instances of
A are assigned to the positive energy (initial) state and those of B to the negative energy
(ﬁnal) state and the quantum superposition of the paired instances deﬁnes the rule. Since
time-like entanglement coeﬃcients deﬁne M-matrix, the interpretation as a law of physics
coded to the structure of the physical state itself is possible. Fermionic degrees of freedom
correspond to the spin indices of WCW spinor ﬁelds. Besides this there are ”orbital” de-
grees of freedom in the moduli space for CDs and in the space of deformations of light-like
3-surfaces. It is natural to assign these degrees of freedom to sensory perception.
(b) The p-adic description of cognition and intentional action involves a generalization of the
notions of number and of imbedding space. The hierarchy of Planck constants means a
further generalization of the notion of imbedding space by replacing it with a book like
structure. It seems that the discrete intersection of real and p-adic space-time surfaces
consisting of rational points (possibly also algebraic points) is crucial from the point of view
of consciousness theory. This is true also for the intersection of real and p-adic variants
of WCW identiﬁed as 3-surfaces whose mathematical representation makes sense in both
real and p-adic number ﬁeldsin preferred coordinate ﬁxed by symmetries.
The ﬁrst intersection is expected to be relevant at quantum ﬁeld theory limit, which
involves the replacement of the partonic 2-surfaces with a discrete subset of points carrying
quantum numbers. The second intersection is relevant in the full quantum theory. The
notion of number theoretic Shannon entropy having negative values makes sense in both
intersections since entanglement probabilities must make sense in both number ﬁelds so
that they are rational or belong to an algebraic extension of rationals. In these intersections
of realities and various p-adicities the evolution of memes is expected to take place.
One manner to understand the special role of rationals and algebraics relies on the observa-
tion that rationals represent islands of order in the sea of chaos deﬁned by reals since their
pinary expansion is predictable and analogous to a periodic orbit of a dynamical system
whereas for a generic real number there is no manner to predict the pinary expansion.
Morphic ﬁelds relevant to living matter
All zero energy states have interpretation as memes or quanta of morphic ﬁelds in TGD frame-
work. One can however ask what zero energy states are relevant for biological systems.

9.8. Could TGD provide justiﬁcation for the ideas of Rupert Sheldrake?
491
(a) The memes relevant to living matter must have a very concrete connection to biology. DNA
as topological quantum computer hypothesis states the magnetic ﬂux tubes connecting
nucleotides to lipids of nuclear and cell membranes deﬁne braid strands needed to realize
topological quantum computations. Nerve pulse patterns induce ﬂuid ﬂows of cytoplasma
and of lipids in turn inducing timelike braidings deﬁning running topological quantum
computation programs and their memory representations as space-like braidings in the
ﬁnal state. These programs living (in very literal sense) in the brains of geometric future
and past deﬁne a 4-D population of memes. The intronic part of the genome is specialized
to topological quantum computations and the time scale in this case can be and must be
faster than for the chemical gene expression. The repetitive character of many intronic
DNA sequences regarded as evidence for their junk character does not mean any restriction
for topological quantum computation.
(b) The notion of magnetic body has a central role in TGD inspired biology. Magnetic body
has an onionl ike fractal structure and astrophysical size with wavelength of EEG wave
deﬁning the size scale of the magnetic body with which it is associated. Magnetic body
acts as as an intentional agent using biological body as a motor instrument and sensory
receptor.
Magnetic body receives sensory and other information from biological body
through EEG and its fractal counterparts and controls biological body via EEG type
signals sent to the genome, where they induce chemical or electromagnetic gene expression.
This allows to imagine also a mechanism of collective learning. The spatio-temporal nerve
pulse patterns deﬁning topological quantum computations are mediated via EEG and its
fractal counterparts to the magnetic body of organism and from it to the magnetic body
of another organism. The magnetic body of Earth - magnetic Mother Gaia- could serve as
a relay station and Schumann resonances and alpha band could allow broadcasting of the
nerve pulse pattern to a large number of magnetic bodies of organisms. From the latter
magnetic body the ﬁeld representation of nerve pulse pattern would induce via EEG type
signal from magnetic body to the receiver genome the original nerve pulse pattern in the
brain of the receiver. Nerve pulse patterns would be quite generally induced by magnetic
bodies via appropriate part of the intronic genome as electromagnetic gene expression.
This mechanism could be also involved with telepathy and remote mental interactions.
(c) Morphic resonance and alike likes alike rule can be understood from the condition that
the intronic parts of genomes must be similar enough to allow the realization of the topo-
logical quantum computation. Also neuronal pathways involved must resemble each other
in order that spatial nerve pulse patterns can be re-produced faithfully enough. Also the
evolutionary levels must be more or less the same in order that the topological quan-
tum computation has same meaning for the receiver and sender. Therefore the collective
memory might be restricted to the level of species. This might be however too strong an
assumption. For instance, shamanism could represent an example of interspecies memory.
The TGD based view about memory allows also the possibility to use the memories of
the already deceased members of species which can in principle continue to exist in the
geometric past.
(d) The general vision about evolution as recreation of the quantum Universe implies that
creativity is in very literal sense a basic aspect of TGD Universe. The U process represents
the creative aspect of consciousness generating quantum super-position of Universes from
which generalized state function reduction process selects the outcome. Both volitional
actions and sensory perception involves the selection but quantum statistical determinism
implies that sensory percepts are usually predictable.
Collective memory, geometric memory and self hierarchy
The notion of species memory is rather radical departure from the teachings of standard neuro-
science so that TGD based view about memory deserves a separate discussion.
TGD predicts inﬁnite hierarchy of selves and if this hierarchy has levels between living systems
and entire universe, the idea about collective memory makes sense and generalizes to an entire
hierachy of them.

492
Chapter 9. Conscious Information and Intelligence
Geometric memory provides a promising candidate for the mechanism of a long term memory.
Geometric memory is made possible by the fact that self can have multitime experiences such
that the space-time sheets associated with various values of the geometric time give contributions
to the experiences and past contributions are experienced as memories. In zero energy ontology
these space-time sheets are associated with sub-CDs of CD associated with self. Both time-
like entanglement betweeen sub-CDs of recent and past implying sharing and fusion of mental
images an classical communications between these CDs are possible and give rise to episodal
memories (direct re-experiences) and symbolic memories.
Since both geometric past and future change in each quantum jump these memories are not
stable: long term memories are certainly unreliable. The memory formation mechanism of brain
however tends to stabilize these memories. There is in principle no upper bound for the span of
the geometric memories and one can consider the possibility of racial memory and even species
memory. Under suitable conditions organism could be able to have the space-time sheets of
the geometric past as its subselves and experiences these memories. Thus geometric memory is
consistent with Sheldrake’s claims and to some degree supports them.
Language learning and morphic resonance
The easiness of children to learn language could have explanation in terms of morphic resonance.
The strong quantum entanglement between the child and parents, especially mother, could make
the morphic resonance possible in the proposed sense. One can even imagine that mother’s
magnetic body directly induces nerve pulse sequences representing linguistic memes in the brain
of child.
One can of course wonder why it is so diﬃcult for the older people to learn language. Do we
force us to learn the language at reﬂective level although it could occur at proto-level also.
Older people learn rules but ﬁnd diﬃcult to apply them whereas child learns to apply the rules
without learning the rules themselves. Are older people so far from quantum criticality that the
large ﬂuctuations leading to the generation of the new level of self-organization are not possible
anymore? The reason could also relate to the degeneration of the magnetic ﬂux tubes circuits
due to ageing so that new topological quantum computation programs are not establishes so
easily anymore.
Self hierarchy, bio-feedback and sociofeedback
Magnetic bodies act as intentional agents in the proposed model. They form also a hierarchy
analogous to master-slave hierarchy. The proposed mechanism of collective learning involves
the magnetic body of Earth in an essential manner. Also magnetic bodies of larger structures
could be involved: there is indeed evidence that remote cognition involves galactic magnetic
ﬁelds [K63] , [J122] .
The phenomenon of bio-feedback provides direct evidence for this phenomenon in a length scale
familiar to us. By monitoring the behavior of say single neuron, it is possible to learn to aﬀect the
behavior of neuron volitionally. No knowledge about how this happens is needed: the volition is
enough. The explanation would be that the information provided by the monitoring goes to the
magnetic body of the person which reacts by sending control signals to the brain. The already
existing magnetic ﬂux tube connections guarantee that the volitional act aﬀects the neuron.
The possibility of biofeedback suggests the possibility of socio-feedback and feedback even at
the level of species and entire biosphere.
An interesting test for the idea that people very close to each other could directly aﬀect the
brain function of each other would be biofeedback in which subject person tries to aﬀect the
behavior of a neuron of a close friend or relative. Mother and child might be an optimal choice
in this respect.

Updates since 2012
A considerable progress has occurred in the understanding of TGD inspired theory of conscious-
ness during the ﬁrst half of 2013. I have not however included separate sections about this
progress since other chapters of ”TGD Inspired theory of consciousness” already contain the
relevant material. A detailed representation of the recent vision about TGD inspired theory of
consciousness [K97] is recommended for the reader interested in details and various philosophical
problems and their solutions in TGD framework.
The basic new result is that NMP applies only in the rational intersection of realities and p-
adicities. The new results are discussed at the end of the chapter ”Negentropy Maximization
Principle” [K44].
The hypothesis that state function reduction means measurement of the
density matrix implies that quantum criticality as degeneracy of eigenvalues of the density
matrix and NMP in the intersection ﬁxes the p-adic prime associated with the criticality. Also a
close connection between quantum criticality, vision about life as something in the intersection of
realities and p-adicities, hierarchy of eﬀective vales of Planck constant, negentropic entanglement,
and p-adic cognition emerges. That various speculative ideas about TGD integrate to single
coherent structure, is certainly an encouraging sign.
The more detailed view about structure of quantum jump in ZEO allows to see the state function
reductions to the opposite boundaries of causal diamond (CD) deﬁning the geometric correlate
for ”spot light of consciousness” as sensory perception and motor action (for updates see the
end of ”About the Nature of Time” [K3]). Motor action can be seen as time reversed sensory
perception. This symmetry is very profound and strong prediction and forces to modify dra-
matically the beliefs about the arrow of geometric time and its relation to the subjective arrow
of time.
This progress has led to the understanding of reﬂective level of consciousness (see the end of
”Quantum Model of Memory” [K66]). Reﬂective consciousness - as opposed to phenomenal con-
sciousness represented by qualia - is certainly one of the key aspects of intelligence. Reﬂective
consciousness can be modelled in terms of various representations - be they sensory, memory, or
cognitive ones - and their time reversals representing expectations, plans, and intentions [K97].
The intuitive idea is that the representations should be approximate invariants under quantum
jump sequence. NMP [K44] indeed implies that negentropic entanglement is approximately in-
variant under quantum jumps. This inspires the idea that various representations (sensory - ,
memory - , cognitive - ) correspond to negentropically entangled systems - ”Akashic records”.
Interaction free quantum measurement allows non-destructive conscious reading of these repre-
sentations in arbitrarily good approximation.
Also the updated view about the realisation of representations is discussed at the end of the
chapter ”Quantum Model of Memory” [K66]. The basic assumption is that K¨ahler magnetic ﬂux
tubes carrying monopole ﬂux and topological light rays (”massless externals” (MEs)) parallel
to them serve as geometric correlates of quantum coherence and their braiding serves as corre-
late for negentropic entanglement. This leads to a rather concrete picture about how various
representations are realised at the level of the magnetic body of the organism.
The conscious reading of the representations by interaction free scattering of dark photons to-
gether with the assumption that biophotons result as dark photons transform to biophotons in
energy conserving manner leads to a direct contact with the experimental reality. The encourag-

Chapter 10
p-Adic Physics as Physics of
Cognition and Intention
10.1
Introduction
TGD as a generalized number theory vision stimulates the hypothesis about p-adic physics
provides the physical correlates of intention, cognition and imagination.
This interpretation
has far reaching implications for both TGD inspired theory of consciousness and for the general
world view provided by TGD. Intentionality and cognition is predicted to be present in all length
scales and the success of the p-adic physics in elementary particle length scales forces to conclude
that intentionality, cognition are present even at this level. In this chapter these implications
are studied from the point of view of cognitive consciousness.
The view about cognition relies also heavily on the developents that have occurred during the
last ﬁve years in the understanding of TGD. The vision about life and conscious information
and intelligence as something in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds is certainly the most
important aspect in this respect and the very fact that the notion of conscious information
makes sense only in this intersection supports the proposed interpretation of p-adic physics.
Zero energy ontology and the notion of causal diamond (CD) with zero energy states having
interpretation as memes in very general sense is also of central importance. The hierarchy of
Planck constants as an explanation of dark matter and energy as macroscopic quantum phases
even in astrophysical scales and implying that dark matter is a key actor in the drama of life is
the third key element.
10.1.1
Clarifying some basic concepts
Before continuing it is could to clarify basic conceps. The recent view is that p-adic space-time
sheets correspond to cognition and that their intersections with real space-time sheets in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds deﬁne cognitive representations. These representations
are deﬁned in terms of data coming from the rational and algebraic points common to real and
partonic 2-surfaces with the algebraic extension in question characterized by the mathematical
representation of the partonic 2-surfaces making sense for both real and p-adic 2-surfaces simul-
taneously. Discrete set of points is always in question. A number theoretic variant of quantum
ﬁeld theory is needed in order to have a ﬁrst principle description of conscious intelligence and
intentionality.
The classical non-determinism of K¨ahler action quite generally implies that space-time surfaces
deﬁne what might be called symbolic representations realizing quantum classical correspondence.
This applies irrespective of the number ﬁeld used and in p-adic context p-adic non-determinism
is an additional ingredient.
For instance, nerve pulse patterns deﬁne symbolic real physics
representations of the sensory input but do not give rise to sensory qualia which reside at the
level of the primary sensory organs (contrary to the expectations raised by various ﬁndings

Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
of neuro-science).
Sensory experience is always a multiverse experience since sensory qualia
have quantum jump increments as quantum correlates, and is thus not reducible to the level of
space-time.
I have use also the notions of meme and morphic ﬁeld. One could defend the identiﬁcation of
the geometric correlates of memes and morphic ﬁelds as p-adic space-time sheets. On the other,
all negentropic quantum states in zero energy ontology have the character of a rule A→B, where
quantum superposition represents various instances a →b of the rule and one could say that
every negentropic zero energy state can be seen as a meme. I leave the choice between these
interpretations for the reader.
10.1.2
Basic vision
It is useful to summarized the recent TGD inspired view about quantum biology and conscious
intelligence since it serves as background for the chapter.
Magnetic body as intentional agent and experiencer
The notion of magnetic body has a central role in TGD inspired biology. Magnetic body has an
onion like fractal structure and astrophysical size with wavelength of EEG wave deﬁning the size
scale of the magnetic body with which it is associated. Magnetic body acts as as an intentional
agent using biological body as a motor instrument and sensory receptor. Magnetic body receives
sensory and other information from biological body through EEG and its fractal counterparts
and controls biological body via EEG type signals sent to the genome, where they induce chem-
ical or electromagnetic gene expression. This allows to imagine also a mechanism of collective
learning. The spatio-temporal nerve pulse patterns deﬁning topological quantum computations
are mediated via EEG and its fractal counterparts to the magnetic body of organism and from
it to the magnetic body of another organism [K21] .
The magnetic body of Earth - magnetic Mother Gaia- could serve as a relay station and Schu-
mann resonances and alpha band could allow broadcasting of the nerve pulse pattern to a large
number of magnetic bodies of organisms. From the latter magnetic body the ﬁeld representation
of nerve pulse pattern would induce via EEG type signal from magnetic body to the receiver
genome the original nerve pulse pattern in the brain of the receiver. Nerve pulse patterns would
be quite generally induced by magnetic bodies via appropriate part of the intronic genome as
electromagnetic gene expression. This mechanism could be also involved with telepathy and
remote mental interactions.
Magnetic ﬂux tubes and ﬂux sheets are basic building bricks of the magnetic body and DNA as
topological quantum computer hypothesis assumes that DNA nucleotides are connected to cell
membrane by ﬂux tubes deﬁning braids playing a key role in topological quantum computation
[K23] . Therefore magnetic body is essential for realizing the software of biological intelligence.
The essential assumption is that magnetic body carries dark matter consisting of ordinary with
a non-standard value of Planck constant. The phase transition changing the value of Planck
constant change the size scale of the ﬂux tube and this process together with reconncetion of
the ﬂux tubes would deﬁne mechanisms of bio-catalysis.
Zero energy ontology, causal diamonds, and quantum states as memes
In zero energy ontology physical states are replaced by pairs of positive and negative energy
states assigned to the past resp. future boundaries of causal diamonds (CDs) deﬁned as pairs
of future and past directed light-cones (δM 4
± × CP2). The net values of all conserved quantum
numbers of zero energy states vanish. Zero energy states are interpreted as pairs of initial and
ﬁnal states of a physical event such as particle scattering so that only events appear in the new
ontology.
Communication with the geometric past using negative energy signals and time-like entangle-
ment are crucial for the TGD inspired quantum model of memory and both make sense in zero

energy ontology. Zero energy ontology leads to a precise mathematical characterization of the
ﬁnite resolution of both quantum measurement and sensory and cognitive representations in
terms of inclusions of von Neumann algebras known as hyperﬁnite factors of type II1 [K92]
. The space-time correlate for the ﬁnite resolution is discretization which appears also in the
formulation of quantum TGD in terms of the modiﬁed Dirac action [K25] .
At the imbedding space-level CD is the correlate of self whereas space-time sheets having their
ends at the light-like boundaries of CD - more precisely, partonic 2-surfaces and the distributions
of the 4-D tangent spaces of space-time sheet associated with them- are the correlates at the
level of 4-D space-time.
The hierarchy of CDs within CDs corresponds to the hierarchy of
selves. Zero energy ontology leads also to an argument explaining why the arrow of subjective
time induces an apparent arrow of geometric time as a result if intentional action and why the
contents of sensory consciousness is restricted to such a narrow time interval (located near the
future boundary of CD) [K3] .
The original interpretation of the space-time correlates of mental images was as mind-like space-
time sheets identiﬁed as space-time sheets with a ﬁnite temporal size. In zero energy ontology
all space-time sheets have a ﬁnite size and serve as correlates for zero energy states, which
could be interpreted as representations of laws of physics as superpositions of pairs of initial and
ﬁnal states given by M-matrix. In state function reduction process these states are reduced to
states for which only negentropic time-like entanglement is possible and one might say that the
negentropy measures the conscious information associated with the ﬁnal state of the reduction
process. One can interpret negentropic quantum states as memes or morphogenetic ﬁelds [K69]
, [I33] These negentropic quantum states are possible only in the intersection of real and p-adic
worlds so that living systems are the systems carrying information and intelligence.
Boolean mind and fermions
The connection of fermionic Fock space basis with Boolean algebra was one of the ﬁrst ideas
related to the quantum modelling of intelligent systems. The state basis for the fermionic Fock
space has a natural interpretation as Boolean algebra (fermion number =1/0↔yes/no). In this
manner ordinary Boolean algebra is extended to a vector space spanned by fermionic states.
Fermion number conservation poses an obvious problem for this scenario in positive energy
ontology. Zero energy ontology resolves this problem quite generally and zero energy states
resulting as an outcome of state function reduction process represent Boolean statements of
type A→B in terms of time-like negentropic entanglement in fermionic degreees of freedom.
The original proposal was to use cognitive fermion pairs instead of fermions with fermion and
antifermion located at the opposite throats of wormhole contact. In the recent formulation of
quantum TGD bosons and their super counterparts correspond to wormhole contacts. An in-
teresting question is whether one could consider ordinary Boolean logic as some kind of limit
for the complex quantum logic and whether our logical mind could have something to do with
Boolean algebra. For instance, could primary ’this is true’ experiences correspond to Boolean
qualia having increments of fermionic quantum numbers as physical correlates. Boolean truth
values could also correspond to spin directions of fermions. In this case fermion number con-
servation does not pose any constraints and the macrosopic realization replaing single spin as a
representative of bit with a magnetized ensemble of fermions, makes the realization robust.
Negentropic entanglement means that qubits are always fuzzy and the fuzziness depends on the
situation. The positive aspect is that the quantum superposition gives rise to an abstraction,
rule about pairing of say initial and ﬁnal states represented as positive and negative energy
parts of zero energy state with the pairs of superposition representing the instances of the rule.
p-Adic-real entanglement with positive deﬁnite number theoretical entanglement entropy in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds could give rise the experience of understanding and makes
possible cognitive quantum computation like processes.

Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intention
The vision about p-adic physics as physics of cognition has gradually established itself as one
of the key idea of TGD inspired theory of consciousness. There are several motivations for this
idea.
The strongest motivation is the vision about living matter as something residing in the inter-
section of real and p-adic worlds. One of the earliest motivations was p-adic non-determinism
identiﬁed tentatively as a space-time correlqte for the non-determinism of imagination. p-Adic
non-determinism follows from the fact that functions with vanishing derivatives are piecewise
constant functions in the p-adic context. More precisely, p-adic pseudo constants depend on the
pinary cutoﬀof their arguments and replace integration constants in p-adic diﬀerential equa-
tions. In the case of ﬁeld equations this means roughly that the initial data are replaced with
initial data given for a discrete set of time values chosen in such a manner that unique solution
of ﬁeld equations results. Solution can be ﬁxed also in a discrete subset of rational points of the
imbedding space. Presumably the uniqueness requirement implies some unique pinary cutoﬀ.
Thus the space-time surfaces representing solutions of p-adic ﬁeld equations are analogous to
space-time surfaces consisting of pieces of solutions of the real ﬁeld equations. p-Adic reality is
much like the dream reality consisting of rational fragments glued together in illogical manner
or pieces of child’s drawing of body containing body parts in more or less chaotic order.
The obvious looking interpretation for the solutions of the p-adic ﬁeld equations is as a geometric
correlate of imagination. Plans, intentions, expectations, dreams, and cognition in general are
expected to have p-adic space-time sheets as their geometric correlates. This in the sense that p-
adic spacetime sheets somehow initiate the real neural processes providing symbolic counterparts
for the cognitive representations provided by p-adic spacetime sheets and p-adic fermions. A
deep principle seems to be involved: incompleteness is characteristic feature of p-adic physics
but the ﬂexibility made possible by this incompleteness is absolutely essential for imagination
and cognitive consciousness in general.
p-Adic space-time regions can suﬀer topological phase transitions to real topology and vice versa
in quantum jumps replacing space-time surface with a new one. This process has interpretation
as a topological correlate for the mind-matter interaction in the sense of transformation of
intention to action and symbolic representation to cognitive representation. p-Adic cognitive
representations could provide the physical correlates for the notions of memes [J37] and morphic
ﬁelds [I33] . p-Adic real entanglement makes possible makes possible cognitive measurements
and cognitive quantum computation like processes, and provides correlates for the experiences
of understanding and confusion.
At the level of brain the fundamental sensory-motor loop could be seen as a loop in which real-to-
p-adic phase transition occurs at the sensory step and its reverse at the motor step. Nerve pulse
patterns would correspond to temporal sequences of quark like sub-CDs of duration 1 millisecond
inside electronic sub-CD of duration .1 s with the states of sub-CDs allowing interpretation as
a bit (this would give rise to memetic code). The real space-time sheets assignable to these
sub-CDs are transformed to p-adic ones as sensory input transforms to thought. Intention in
transforms to action in the reverse process in motor action. One can speak about creation of
matter from vacuum in these time scales.
Although p-adic space-time sheets as such are not conscious, p-adic physics would provide beau-
tiful mathematical realization for the intuitions of Descartes. The formidable challenge is to
develop experimental tests for p-adic physics. The basic problem is that we can perceive p-adic
reality only as ’thoughts’ unlike the ’real’ reality which represents itself to us as sensory experi-
ences. Thus it would seem that we should be able generalize the physics of sensory experiences
to physics of cognitive experiences.
Life as something in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and negentropic
entanglement
In the p-adic context one must modify Shannon’s deﬁnition of entropy by replacing the ordi-
nary logarithm based on p-adic norm. This deﬁnition gives rise to a real valued entropy in

10.1. Introduction
499
both real and p-adic contexts if entanglement coeﬃcients are rational/algebraic numbers. For
irrational/non-algebraic entanglement standard Shannon formula and its p-adic variant must be
used and gives rise to non-negative entropy. Unlike Shannon entropy, the p-adic entropies (one
for each p) can be also negative so that the entanglement entropy deﬁnes a genuine informa-
tion measure whose sign tells whether the system contains information or dis-information. For
the p-adic entropies Negentropy Maximization Principle [K44] tends to preserve the quantum
coherence if p divides the common denominator of the entanglement probabilities. The states
with rational/algebraic entanglement can be regarded as new kind of states analogous to bound,
which are not at all fragile like the states with non-algebraic entanglement are. In particular,
these states need not be bound due to the binding energy.
For instance, the problematic notion of high energy phosphate bond could be understood in
terms of negentropic entanglement making possible correlations without binding energy so that
the ATP→ADP process deﬁning fundamental step of metabolism could be interpreted in terms
of negentropy transfer. Negentropic entanglement is highly stable in state function reduction
process so that the randomness of quantum jump does not apply to it.
As a consequence,
the second law of thermodynamics is broken in the scale deﬁned by the size of CD involved.
A natural interpretation is that subselves lose consciousness as ordinary entropic bound state
entanglement is generated but experience expansion of consciousness when negentropic entan-
glement is generated. Positive emotions like love, experience of understanding would naturally
accompany the generation of negentropic entanglement.
These observations lead to a purely number-theoretic characterization of life: life is in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds: life corresponds to islands of rational/algebraic numbers
in the seas of real and p-adic continua. This vision have rapidly become the most important
source of insight in attempts to develop TGD based vision about conscious intelligence and
cognition.
Hierarchy of Planck constants and consciousness
The hierarchy of Planck constants is realized in terms of a generalization of the causal diamond
CD × CP2, where CD is deﬁned as an intersection of the future and past directed light-cones
of 4-D Minkowski space M 4. CD × CP2 is generalized by gluing singular coverings and factor
spaces of both CD and CP2 together like pages of book along common back, which is 2-D sub-
manifold which is M 2 for CD and homologically trivial geodesic sphere S2 for CP2 [K24] . The
value of the Planck constant characterizes partially given page and arbitrary large values of ℏ
are predicted so that macroscopic quantum phases are possible since the fundamental quantum
scales scale like ℏ. All particles in the vertices of Feynman diagrams have the same value of
Planck constant so that particles at diﬀerent pages cannot have local interactions. Thus one can
speak about relative darkness in the sense that only the interactions mediated by the exchange
of particles and by classical ﬁelds are possible between diﬀerent pages. Dark matter in this
sense can be observed, say through the classical gravitational and electromagnetic interactions.
It is in principle possible to photograph dark matter by the exchange of photons which leak
to another page of book, reﬂect, and leak back. This leakage corresponds to ℏchanging phase
transition occurring at quantum criticality and living matter is expected carry out these phase
transitions routinely in bio-control. This picture leads to no obvious contradictions with what
is really known about dark matter and to my opinion the basic diﬃculty in understanding of
dark matter (and living matter) is the blind belief in standard quantum theory.
Dark matter hierarchy and p-adic length scale hierarchy would provide a quantitative formulation
for the self hierarchy. To a given p-adic length scale one can assign a secondary p-adic time
scale as the temporal distance between the tips of the causal diamond (pair of future and past
directed light-cones in H = M 4×CP2). For electron this time scale is .1 second, the fundamental
biorhythm. For a given p-adic length scale dark matter hierarchy gives rise to additional time
scales coming as ℏ/ℏ0 multiples of this time scale. These two hierarchies could allow to get rid
of the notion of self as a primary concept by reducing it to a quantum jump at higher level of
hierarchy. Self would in general consists of quantum jumps inside quantum jumps inside... and
thus experience the ﬂow of time through sub-quantum jumps.

500
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
The hierarchy of Planck constants means the possibility of temporal zooms of the event sequences
of the external world making possible ’stories’ as either zoomed up or zoomed down versions of
the actual course of events. This makes possible simulation in the time natural time scales of
neuronal activity and is expected to be a key element of conscious intelligence and cognition.
10.1.3
Topics of the chapter
The topics of the chapter is as follows.
(a) The relationship between p-adic physics, intentionality, and cognition is discussed on gen-
eral level.
(b) Possible evidence for p-adic cognition is considered.
(c) In the mathematical sections the relationship between intentionality, cognition and number
theory is discussed. Also the relationship between p-adic and real physics is discussed at
general level with basic vision being that the intersection of real and p-adic space-time
sheets in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds consists of points belonging to the
algebraic extension of rational needed to guarantee that the mathematical representation
of the partonic 2-surface makes sense both in real and p-adic sense.
(d) Frontal lobes are known to be the seat of the higher level intentional action and are
discussed from p-adic point of view.
(e) A generalization of the memetic code to cognitive codes is discussed and some proposals
about codes are made. This generalization is based on p-adic length scale hypothesis and
the condition that the time scales involved correspond to time scales assignable to the CDs
of the known elementary particles does not favor the generalization. On the other hand,
the dark matter sector could allow entire fractal hierarchy of elementary particle physics
whose existence is reﬂected as fundamental bio-rhytms and cognitive codes.
(f) The intersection of real and p-adic partonic 2-surfaces deﬁning space-like cognitive repre-
sentations consist of algebraic points. The hypothesis that these intersections obey various
kind of symmetries identiﬁable as molecular symmetries is discussed.
10.2
p-Adic physics, intentionality, and cognition
The basic vision is that volitional acts are realized as phase transitions of a p-adic space-time
region to a real space-time region. These phase transitions are 4-dimensional and induces in
quantum jumps.
10.2.1
The three non-determinisms
TGD Universe is characterized by a ’holy trinity’ of non-determinisms. The ﬁrst non-determinism
is associated with quantum jumps between quantum histories and is what makes possible sub-
jective existence and consciousness.
One achieve determinism by giving up the assumption
that initial values at ﬁxed time deﬁne the time evolution and replaces 3-dimensional sections of
space-time surface with what I have called mind-like space-time sheets. The attempt to real-
ized this picture geometrically led to zero energy ontology. Second non-determinism is classical
non-determinism of K¨ahler action and is to symbolic representations and perhaps also with
macroscopic volition. The third non-determinism is inherent to all p-adic ﬁeld equations and
might correspond to the non-determinism of imagination and thus makes possible cognition and
intentionality. There is no conscious experience associated with classical nor with p-adic non-
determinism as dualist might think. These three non-determinisms have turned out to be basic
building bricks of TGD inspired theory of consciousness.

10.2. p-Adic physics, intentionality, and cognition
501
The original identiﬁcation of the geometric correlates of selves was as mind like space-time
sheets. In zero energy ontology all real space-time sheets satisfy the criterion for mind-likeness
and therefore serve as correlates for selves. In the p-adic context this restriction is in principle
un-necessary. Classical and p-adic non-determinisms make it natural to introduce the notion
of association sequence deﬁned as a sequence of space like 3-surfaces with time like separations
determining uniquely the absolute minimum space-time surface going through these 3-surfaces.
In the case of CP2 vacuum type extremals discrete association sequences become in principle
continuous sequences of 3-surfaces but topological condensation is expected to reduce this non-
determinism to its discrete version.
10.2.2
Classical non-determinism and symbolic representations
In the special case that classical non-determinism gives rise to macroscopic multifurcations of
the time development of 3-surface, it is tempting to identify the branches of the multifurcations
as alternative choices involved with volitional acts. Contrary to the long held beliefs, it however
seems that classical non-determinism is most naturally associated with symbolic representations
understood in a very general sense (one could even understand classical space-time surfaces as
symbolic representations of quantum dynamics). The assignment of sensory experiences with
real mind like space-time sheets explains why the contents of sensory experiences are localized
with respect to geometric time.
The book ”G¨odel, Escher, Bach” by Douglas Hofstadter about self-reference has been perhaps
the most fascinating of my intellectual arm chair adventures and it stimulated the dream about
the identiﬁcation of the physical counterpart of self-reference.
The physics as a generalized
number theory vision stimulated concrete ideas about how this self-reference might be realized
in terms of quantum universe repeatedly re-creating itself. The quantum jump building sensory
and cognitive representations about the Universe means the replacement of the Universe with a
new one containing these representations. Hence the paradoxical inﬁnite regress resulting from
the assumption that it is possible to be conscious about what one is conscious of is avoided
with a simple modiﬁcation of this assumption by replacing ’is’ with ’was’. By quantum classical
correspondence this vision requires also the failure of classical determinism in the conventional
sense of the word.
In accordance with the crossing symmetry of standard quantum ﬁeld theories, one can interpret
the elements of M-matrix (generalization of S-matrix in TGD framework) as time-like entan-
glement coeﬃcients between positive and negative energy parts of the zero energy state with
incoming and outgoing particles having positive and negative energies respectively. Thus the
classical non-determinism and zero energy ontology make possible for the TGD Universe accord-
ing to represent the laws of physics in the structure of the zero energy physical states. That
all possible vacua provide representation for physics is very much akin to the ideas of Eastern
philosophies, and is bound to have deep implications from the point of view of TGD inspired
theory of consciousness.
10.2.3
p-Adic non-determinism and cognition
p-Adic non-determinism follows from the fact that functions with vanishing derivatives are piece-
wise constant functions in the p-adic context.
(a) p-Adic pseudo constants depend on the pinary cutoﬀof their arguments and replace in-
tegration constants in p-adic diﬀerential equations.
In the case of ﬁeld equations this
means roughly that the initial data are replaced with initial data given for a discrete set
of time values chosen in such a manner that unique solution of ﬁeld equations results.
Since the fundamental formulation of quantum TGD [K92] indeed relies on the notion of
ﬁnite measurement resolution, a highly attractive interpretation of this cutoﬀis in terms
of measurement resolution of some kind.
(b) Solution can be ﬁxed in a discrete subset of rational (algebraic) points of the imbedding
space. In the case of space-time surfaces this set is expected to have inherent cutoﬀsince

502
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
the condition of rationality (or algebraicity in the extension of p-adic numbers used) posed
separately for all imbedding space coordinates is very strong. Note that preferred imbed-
ding space coordinates are required and this kind of coordinate systems indeed existence
thanks to the isometries of the imbedding space.
Clearly, the space-time surfaces representing solutions of p-adic ﬁeld equations are analogous to
space-time surfaces consisting of pieces of solutions of the real ﬁeld equations. p-Adic reality is
much like the dream reality consisting of rational fragments glued together in illogical manner
or pieces of child’s drawing of body containing body parts in more or less chaotic order.
The obvious interpretation for the solutions of the p-adic ﬁeld equations would be as geometric
correlates of intentionality. Plans, intentions, expectations, dreams, and possibly also cognition
as imagination in general are expected to have p-adic cognitive space-time sheets as their geo-
metric correlates. A deep principle seems to be involved: incompleteness is the characteristic
feature of p-adic physics but the ﬂexibility made possible by this incompleteness is absolutely
essential for imagination and cognitive consciousness in general. One must be very cautious in
order to not misinterpret the role of p-adic physics. Imagination and cognition, as they are de-
ﬁned in the neuro-science, have also deﬁnite neural correlates at the level of real physics so that
obviously both p-adic and real physics are involved. p-Adic space-time sheets would deﬁne the
initial values with respect to subjective time for the neural processes responsible for imagination
and intentions whereas in the case of cognitive representations p-adic space-time sheets would
correspond to the ﬁnal values.
(a) For instance, the following argument provides support for the p-adic description of cog-
nition. p-Adic-real entanglement (as also other kinds of non-diagonal entanglements) is
possible in fermionic degrees of freedom if one assumes that the entanglement coeﬃcients
are algebraic numbers. Negentropic entanglement is stable against self measurements so
that macro-temporal quantum coherence results. The natural guess is that this kind of
entanglement is a correlate for the experience of understanding.
This would strongly
encourage the interpretation as a cognitive entanglement so that the corresponding self
measurement could be called cognitive measurement.
Thus the core element of cognition (intentionality) would be the p-adic space-time sheet
representing the ﬁnal (initial) values of the neural process with respect to subjective time,
which in turn could be seen as a symbolic representation of cognition or imagination. In this
conceptual framework cognitive representations are p-adic and symbolic representations
real and brain mostly builds symbolic representations from the sensory input and from
cognitive representations and vice versa.
(b) There should be some distinction between the p-adic correlates of intentionality and cog-
nition. This kind of distiction corresponds to time reversal. Motor and sensory repre-
sentations are time reversals of each other in TGD framework and therefore intention
(cognition) giving rise to motor representation (resulting from sensory representation) are
naturally time reversals of each other. In zero energy ontology they would correspond to
positive and negative energy states. Note that for virtual bosons can be regarded as pairs
of positive and negative energy particles so that for pairs of p-adic positive and negative
energy massless extremals cognition and intention can couple to a kind of sensory-motor
time-loop.
Basic vision about qualia
Before proceeding it is useful to summarize the basic view about qualia [K28] .
(a) Geometric qualia correspond to the increments of conﬁguration space zero modes in quan-
tum jump and are cognitive qualia. Shape, size,length duration, ... etc. are good examples
of geometric qualia. Real geometric qualia could be also called symbolic qualia. The uni-
verse of symbolic representations is completely classical if a complete localization in the
zero modes occurs in each quantum jump. It is not completely clear whether this must be

10.2. p-Adic physics, intentionality, and cognition
503
the case also in the real WCW degrees of freedom. In p-adic conﬁguration space degrees
(WCW, ”the world of classical worlds”) of freedom it must take place so that cognition
would be completely classical. The moduli space for CDs is an excellent candidate for the
fundamental geometric qualia [K70, K64] .
(b) Sensory qualia correspond to the increments of quantum numbers related to the quantum
ﬂuctuating degrees of freedom, non-zero modes. They are genuine multi-verse qualia since
the ﬁnal states of quantum jumps are superpositions of space-time surfaces with vary-
ing values of non-zero modes. One cannot understand color red in terms of space-time
geometry.
(c) The trinity sensory-symbolic-cognitive is central for understanding consciousness in TGD
framework. Also the division to fermionic (conﬁguration space spinor) and conﬁguration
space degrees of freedom at the level of qualia is important. Fermionic qualia correspond
to Boolean qualia (both p-adic and real and associated with conformal and quaternion
conformal fermionic degrees of freedom). Conﬁguration space qualia correspond to geo-
metric and sensory qualia in the real case and only geometric qualia in the p-adic case
(cognition has no colors).
p-Adic–real phase transitions and matter-mind interaction
If one accepts the idea that real and p-adic space-time regions are correlates for matter and
intentionality, one encounters the question how matter and mind interact. A good candidate
for this interaction is the phase transition leading to a transformation of the real space-time
regions to p-adic ones and vice versa. These transformations can take place in quantum jumps.
p-Adic-to-real phase transition would have interpretation as a transformation of thought into
a sensory experience (dream or hallucination) or intention to an action.
The reverse phase
transition would relate to the transformation of the sensory experience to cognition.
(a) The real↔p-adic transformations -and more generally, p1-adic↔p2-adic transformations
would occur in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. In other words, the mathematical
representation of the partonic 2-surfaces plus the distribution of their 4-D tangent planes
would make sense in all number ﬁelds or at least suitable algebraic extensions of them.
Therefore the leakage between diﬀerent number ﬁelds would have a precise mathematical
meaning. The unitary U-matrix characterizing the unitary process must describe these
transitions and its matrix elements should involve only data about the intersection of
partonic 2-surfaces belonging to diﬀerent number ﬁelds: that is from points of real 2-
surface at points belonging to the algebraic extension of rationals considered. Hence the
description of intention and cognition should be in terms of what might be called number
theoretic quantum ﬁeld theory. A rudimentary formulation of U-matrix in this manner is
discussed in [K44] .
(b) The mere p-adic–transitions do not seem to be enough for understanding intentional action
and one can also consider the generation of real and p-adic zero energy states from vacuum.
This is required also by a reasonable model for intentional action realized in terms of p-
adic–real transition. The fact that 1 ms and .1 s time scales correspond to important
biological time scales as well as time scales assignable to quark and electron CDs suggests
that this process takes place routinely in living matter.
(c) Although zero energy ontology in principle allows a creation of zero energy states with
arbitrarily large energies of positive energy part of the state as analogs of quantum ﬂuctu-
ations, the condition that the entanglement is negentropic poses energetic constraints since
negentropic entanglement carries ”negative binding energy” having interpretation as or-
dered energy. The interpretation as metabolic energy allows to understand the somewhat
foggy concept of energetic phosphate bond central for ATP-ADP process [K26] . What is
transferred in this process would be negentropy rather than mere energy.

(d) Em ﬁelds, in particular ELF em ﬁelds, are crucial for TGD inspired model of brain and a
natural question is whether p-adic–real phase transitions occur also for massless extremals
(MEs). These transitions could occur also for elementary particles. I have proposed the
generation MEs as a mechanism of coherent locomotion made possible by the maximally
coherent momentum carried by ME and resulting as a recoil momentum of material system
absorbing second ME. In fact, the mechanism is optimal since the momentum of ME is
completely coherent. Thus a possible interpretation is as a transformation of intention to
real motion. Of course, it is diﬃcult to say whether this mechanism occurs in cellular or
micro-tubular length scales or perhaps even in macroscopic lengths scales. And there are
certainly also other mechanisms.
A more reﬁned picture about the realization of intentions emerges, when one asks how a precisely
targeted intention could be realized at the atomic or molecular level.
(a) The change must involve energetic changes in the scale of the entire system so that the
quantum numbers characterizing the positive energy part of the state change. This includes
energy and momentum. It seems safe to assume that zero energy states are created in
rather small length scales and that macroscopic systems cannot transform between real
and p-adic states. Hence the bottle neck step of the process would be the generation of
zero energy states from vacuum as sub-CD with a rather short characteristic time scale
and their subsequent interaction with the existing state inducing the desired action.
(b) This favors the generation of zero energy states representing elementary particles and
electrons and quarks are excellent candidates in this respect for reasons that should be
already clear. The sub-CD created from vacuum could be p-adic and transform to a real
one and interact with the background to induce the transition. Protons and electrons are
key actors in bio-catalysis and TGD forces to consider the possibility that at least electron
and quarks exist only in the sense of zero energy ontology.
(c) The creation of sub-CD can be interpreted direction of attention of CD to a particular
spatiotemporal region inside it. If this region is near vacuum extremal it is critical and
the subsequent interaction of sub-CD with 4-D environment can induce a large change of
the entire system.
Another view about motor action is as negative energy signal send to the geometric past and
inducing a neural activity leading to the motor action as a consequence. This view conforms with
the ﬁndings of Libet and others [J80] . It should be possible to fuse these two views together.
(a) The intention can be realized in a precisely targeted manner only for the transitions which
do not occur spontaneously, and thus involve the emission of negative energy MEs. For
a transition involving emission of positive energy, the direction of ME is random so that
targeted intentional action is not possible.
(b) The emission of negative energy ME translates to a quantum jump in which the energy of
the positive energy part of zero energy state increases in the interaction with sub-CD or
some other CD. The generation of negative energy MEs would utilize the quantum credit
card mechanism of metabolism implying extreme ﬂexibility.
(c) Credit card mechanism requires the existence of a system analogous to a population re-
versed laser. The TGD based model for metabolism assumes that electrons or protons
kicked to a small space-time sheet provide this system and that their dropping to a larger
space-time liberates zero point kinetic energy as metabolic energy. Hence sensory, cog-
nitive and memory representations would be realized in terms of positive energy MEs
spontaneously whereas intentionality and motor actions would be much like time reversed
sensory representations and realized in terms of negative energy MEs.

Cognition and intention at elementary particle length scales?
The success of p-adic mass calculations [K50, K51, K45] does not leave much room for the
interpretations if one identiﬁes p-adic physics as a physics of cognition: cognitive representations
must be present already at elementary particle level. This is true if elementary particle reside in
the intersection of the real and p-adic worlds quite generally. This would mean that p-adic–real
phase transitions occur and transform real zero energy states to p-adic ones and vice versa. The
mathematical description of this process in terms of U-matrix as a leakage between sectors of
WCW (”world of classical worlds”) corresponding to diﬀerent number ﬁelds is discussed in [K44]
.
If the interpretation of nerve pulse patterns as a manner to generate memetic codons is correct,
not only the real-p-adic transitions would be possible but also the creation of zero energy states
representing electrons and quarks could occur completely routinely in living matter.
In the
standard physics framework the interpretation would be as quantum ﬂuctuations generating
fermion pairs from vacuum. In TGD framework these quantum ﬂuctuations become quantum
states with precisely deﬁned characteristics.
What makes this hypothesis testable is the prediction that the time scales of CDs assignable
to electron and quarks should deﬁne fundamental time scales of living matter. This seems to
be the case. kHz neuronal synchrony is only one example. kHz frequency and 10 Hz frequency
would be associated also with ”dead” matter if cognition is present at elementary particle level.
A particular prediction is the failure of second law below these time scales. This kind of failure
has been indeed observed [D11] and the eﬀect indeed involves millisecond and .1 second time
scales [K44] .
The experience has taught that physical system can be understood throughly only after the
characteristic time scales have been understood. In case of biology the prevailing reductionistic
attitude has led to the belief that living matter is a basic example of a ”non-tidy” system so
that the time and length scales associated with living matter are more or less accidental as also
genetic code and the miracles of bio-chemistry. My own belief is that this attitude is wrong and
explains why the progress in the theoretical understanding of living matter has been so slow.
Cognitive degeneracy and the survival of the ﬁttest
Quantum classical correspondence leads to the proposal that K¨ahler function deﬁned as the
negative for K¨ahler action for a preferred extremal and proportional to the integral of B2
K −E2
K
equals to the total entanglement negentropy assignable to the selves resulting the state function
reduction sequence [K14] .
The vacuum functional identiﬁed as the exponent entropy- that
is K¨ahler function - would disfavor negentropic states unless they have large degeneracy. The
analog of this situation is encountered already in string models where Hagedorn temperature
deﬁnes a limiting temperature because the density of states as function of mass increases ex-
ponentially. The proposal is that this degeneracy behaves as the exponent of the negative of
the K¨ahler function for the critical value of K¨ahler coupling strength so that the negentropy
content of the Universe can be inﬁnite at criticality. Below it it is ﬁnite and above it the theory
is ill-deﬁned mathematically. This could hold true in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds
but not generally and would thus raise living systems in a special role.
Physical systems with large degenerary would be favored. 4-D spin glass degeneracy suggests
that these systems correspond to small deformations of vacuum extremals. If the ﬁnal states
of quantum jumps have roughly the same probabilities, this means that quantum jumps lead
with highest probability to those states for which cognitive degeneracy is highest. The mere
ability to imagine would mean winning in the ﬁght for survival. A physical system with high
degeneracy would also have a large repertoare of transformations of p-adic space-time sheets to
real space-time sheets and is thus highly adaptive and survives for this reason.
The emergence of symbols
p-Adic non-determinism gives rise to cognitive representations whereas the non-determinism of
the real K¨ahler action gives rise to symbolic representations in terms of association sequences

506
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
consisting of space like 3-surfaces with time like separations: the individual space like 3-surfaces
play the role of words of sentence.
Conscious activities are indeed highly symbolic: a push of button can initiate a nuclear war. The
reduction of the p-adic-to-real phase transitions to some fundamental level, perhaps to the level
of nerve pulse transmission, indeed makes possible a build-up of very complex actions by using
a repertoare of very simple basic actions serving p-adic memes translatable to symbols in case
that system is initial value sensitive. p-Adic MEs and p-adic variants of elementary particles
and corresponding CDs provide an excellent candidate for the cognitive representations deﬁning
the buttons and would initiate neural processes deﬁning symbolic representations. Also memetic
code and quarks would be involved.
The idea that motor actions are time reversed perceptions allows a simple view about imagined
motor activities. Imagined motor actions would be initiated by a transformation of p-adic MEs to
real negative energy MEs at some level above muscles and proceed to the cortex as time reversed
activities as far as the MEs controlling these activities are considered. Negative energies make
possible precisely targeted intention. There is no need to stop the imagined motor action so
that it is not a safety risk. It is possible to learn motor actions by initiating them from a level
above the muscles. Time reversal means negative energies for MEs and buy now-let others pay
mechanism implies extreme ﬂexibility. Time reversed dissipation can be interpreted as a healing
mechanism since entropy decreases in the standard direction of the geometric time. Thus the
motor action can be thought of as a carving of a four-dimensional statue by a gradual reﬁnement
and error corrections using dissipation as a Darwinian selector. No detailed planning is needed:
only a rough sketch is enough in the time scale of the motor action and Nature takes care of the
rest.
p-Adic fractality suggests that cognitive representations are present at all length scales: in partic-
ular, p-adic MEs are excellent candidates for cognitive representations. Symbolic representations
are obtained from these by p-adic-to-real phase transitions. Nothing however forbids a reper-
toare of simple MEs serving as symbols, typically frequencies or ﬁeld patterns, and generating
neural activities in turn amplitied to macroscopic actions.
10.2.4
What cognitive representations are and how they develop?
It is far from clear what cognitive representations are and how they develop. The recent vision
about generalized imbedding space and about life as something in the intersection of real and p-
adic worlds provides one answer to the question but p-adic mass calculations force to ask whether
also cognitive representations mapping the external world the space-time sheet of system and
absed on some variant of canonical identiﬁcation could exist.
Questions about cognitive representations
(a) What are the basic types of cognitive representations. There are two basic correspondences
between reals and p-adics induced by common rationals and canonical identiﬁcation or
some map akin to it. One might guess that self-representations are induced by common
rationals whereas representations of the external world could be induced by a proper
generaliz of canonical identiﬁcation mapping rationals to themselves up to some power of
p. In both cases there is some pinary cutoﬀdetermining the goodness of the representation.
For the identiﬁcation based on common rationals or algebraics the geometry of the surfaces
would dictate the resolution inherently.
(b) How cognitive representations evolve? p-Adic ﬁeld equations are same as real ﬁeld equa-
tions so that one can say that Nature determines the p-adic cognitive representation once
the p-adic integration constants, which are pseudoconstants, are given. p-Adic pseudo-
constants are the basic input of the cognitive representation determined more or less com-
pletely by the sensory input coded into nerve pulse patterns and EEG waves.

10.2. p-Adic physics, intentionality, and cognition
507
(c) What is the mechanism of the reality testing? There must be somekind of reality testing
for cognitive representations allowing to gradually tune up the values of the p-adic inte-
gration constants. p-Adic-to-real phase transitions in principle make possible this kind of
testing. For instance, cognitive representation can be transformed to real (symbolic) one
and compared with the sensory input represented by nerve pulse and propagating in a
closed loop in neural circuits. An iterative procedure converging rapidly to a ﬁxed point
representation could be involved. At least in some case ideal representation is the one for
which p-adic pseudo constants reduce to genuine constants. This kind of iterated compar-
ison process could be also seen as a self-organization process leading to standardized ﬁnal
state patterns.
(d) What is the relationship to the memetics of Susan Blackmore [J37] ? p-Adic cognitive
representations are excellent candidates for the physical realization of memes .
Susan
Blackmore sees memes as independent objects using brain as a tool of replication. One
can wonder whether p-adic cognitive representations could also have equally independent
existence and use brain as at tool for the materialization and replcation, and whether
there are p-adic memes ﬂoating all around and waiting for a materialization. TGD based
interpretation of DNA as a material realization of association sequences suggests also
that DNA should could have a p-adic counterpart possibly able to replicate. A further
interesting question is is the role of the p-adic ghostly DNA double helix as as a template
in the replication of the physical DNA.
Two kinds of cognitive representations
At the level of the space-time surfaces and imbedding space the construction of cognitive map
boils down to the task of ﬁnding a map mapping real space-time region to a p-adic space-time
region. These regions correspond to deﬁnite regions of the rational imbedding space so that the
map has a clear geometric interpretation at the level of rational physics.
The basic constraint on the map is that both real and p-adic space-time regions satisfy ﬁeld
equations: p-adic ﬁeld equations make sense even if the integral deﬁning the K¨ahler action
does not exist p-adically. p-Adic non-determinism makes possible this map when one allows a
ﬁnite pinary cutoﬀcharacterizing the resolution of the cognitive representation. The fact that
ﬁeld equations are satisﬁed implies that physics laws are automatically built into the cognitive
representation.
There are two basic types of cognitive representations, which might be called self-representations
and representations of the external world and the map mediating p-adicization is diﬀerent for
these two maps.
The correspondence induced by the common rational points (or those in
algebraic extension of rationals) respects algebraic structures and deﬁnes self-representation.
Given real and p-adic space-time surfaces have a subset of rational points as common. The
identiﬁcation of the common rationals can be extended to a unique correspondence between real
and p-adic 2-surfaces if the 2-surfaces belong to the intersection of the real and p-adic worlds.
This correspondence is however not between all points of the real and p-adic varint of the 2-
surface. The number of rational points is an inherent property of the partonic 2- and allows
to deﬁne also the notion of number theoretic braid natural when the measurement resolution
is ﬁnite [K16] . The common points deﬁne a cognitive representation and the quality of the
representation is deﬁned by the resolution of the map and the pinary cutoﬀfor the rationals
in the pinary expansion is a possible measure for the resolution just as the decimal cutoﬀis a
natural measure for the resolution of a numerical model.
Consider next candidate for a cognitive map based on a modiﬁcation of the canonical identiﬁ-
cation and having the property that it maps all points of real 2-surface to the points of p-adic
2-surface and vice versa in locally continuous manner.
(a) Canonical identiﬁcation or its variant applied to entire space-time sheet would not respect
the basic symmetries of quantum TGD nor ﬁeld equations. Therefore it is necessary to
restrict to a map to partonic 2-surfaces plus their 4-D tangent space distributions. The

508
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
failure to realize this led to the skepticism concerning the usefulness of this map at space-
time level. Later it however turned out that it could make sense at the level of momentum
space for Feynman diagrams [K59] .
(b) The variant of the canonical identiﬁcation deﬁned as prk(m/n) →p−rkIk(m)/Ik(n), with
m ≥0 and n ≥0 not divisible by pk, and Ik(x) deﬁned as x = P xnpnk →P xnp−nk maps
p-adics to reals and its inverse has the same form. It maps rationals to rationals. It also
maps rationals satisfying m < pk, n < pk, to themselves apart from scaling by p−2rk so
that co-incides with identiﬁcation along common rationals in the subset of rationals with
r = 0. One can say that arithmetics and symmetries are respected in the resolution deﬁned
by pk. The map is also continuous. A hybrid of canonical identication and identiﬁcation
along common rationals is in question. The map can be also modiﬁed by mapping prk to
itself rather than its inverse.
(c) The inverse of the map from real rationals to p-adics can be made single valued. The
continuation to reals is not single valued since the map from p-adics maps three points to
single point in the general case. As an example consider p = 2 and two representations
of real unit as 1 and P
k≥1 2−k mapped to p-adic units and p-adic −2 respectively. The
multiplication of the numerator and denominator by these representations of unit gives 3
diﬀerent images for real number and even real rational unless one selects the ﬁnite 2-adic
expansion. Similar results holds generally.
(d) A possible interpretation is that the power pk for m and n characterizes the measurement
resolution. The points common to the p-adic 2-surface and its real counterpart would
deﬁne the resolution and in in shorter length scales one could use either p-adic or real
topology without losing anything.
(e) General coordinate invariance at imbedding space level is not obvious. CP2 is a com-
pact manifold and a possible technical problem relates to CP2 coordinates. The complex
coordinates transforming linearly under U(2) ⊂SU(3) and deﬁning a unique choice of
quantization axes for color isospin and hypercharge have the required range of variation
allowing the proposed construction. In the case of M 4 linear Minkowski coordinates with
origin at either tip of CD are the unique choice apart from Lorentz transformations. The
choice of these coordinates speciﬁes the choice of quantization axis of various isometry
charges. In a well-deﬁned sense the choice of the quantization axis and a special coor-
dinate system implies the breaking of color symmetry and general coordinate invariance.
The realization of the hierarchy of Planck constants however forces this kind of choice in
both M 4 and CP2 degrees of freedom and the moduli space for CDs includes also the space
for the choices of quantization axis so that fundamental symmetries are not broken. One
could perhaps say that the cognition aﬀects real physics via the imbedding space points
shared by real and p-adic space-time sheets and that these common points deﬁne an ap-
proximation of the real space-time surface as a discrete set of points. This discretization
would be analogous to the discretization needed in any numerical computation.
In the intersection of real and p-adic worlds this map deﬁnes naturally a map from real partonic
2-surface to another real partonic 2-surface which is p-adic fractal and a possible interpretation
might be as symbolic representation.
(a) At the ﬁrst step one maps real partonic 2-surface to its p-adic counterpart by a mere
re-interpretation of the deﬁning equation deﬁning a map from real to p-adic world. At
the second step the modiﬁed canonical identiﬁcation maps the p-adic 2-surface back to a
real 2-surface. This map is unique. If the cutoﬀpk is choosen high enough the map maps
rational points prkm/n to their scaled variants p−rkm/n.
(b) By its continuity the modiﬁed of canonical identiﬁcation would map arbitrary distant
points of the real imbedding space (in the sense of having distance which is proportional
to a power of pk) near to each other and would be analogous to a Fourier transform
combining data about arbitrary distant points. Above (below) the cutoﬀthe representation

10.2. p-Adic physics, intentionality, and cognition

is hologram (photograph) like representation of the original 2-surface. The map would
assign to the original 2-surface a continuous 2-surface which is not expected to reside in
the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. The map between the points of these surfaces
is however discontinuous but has long range correlations in the sense that points whose
coordinates diﬀer by a power of pk are mapped near each other. Hence one can regard
the map between the original and ﬁnal 2-surface as a p-adic fractal. Same might apply to
the corresponding space-time surfaces. The map takes long length scales to short length
scales and vice versa for points for the points with m and n below the cutoﬀ.
(c) Also the tangent space distribution of the p-adic partonic 2-surface would be mapped by
a canonical identiﬁcation to give a continuous distribution. In the set of common rational
points p-adic continuity could induce p-adic fractality as long range correlations between
points for which coordinates diﬀer by a power pk and short distance chaos.
Also the
resulting space-time surface could reﬂect this fractality. One can also construct at the
p-adic surface p-adically smooth induced spinor ﬁeld and map both the 2-surface and the
induced spinor ﬁeld back by the modiﬁed canonical identiﬁcation to obtain spinorial p-adic
fractal. Since partonic 2-surfaces in zero energy ontology have components at both future
and past boundaries of CD this map can scale down the CD to much smaller CD. Note
also the presence of sub-CDs. A possible problem is that the real 2-surface resulting in the
proposed map need not be diﬀerentiable. If this is not the case the induced gauge ﬁelds
are not well deﬁned and it might be necessary to pose a cutoﬀto achieve this.
(d) These observations raise some questions. Does also the 4-D space-time surface assignable
to the image of the partonic 2-surface obtained in this manner deﬁne a hologram like
representation of the orginal space-time surface having interpretation as a p-adic fractal?
In the case of brain this would mean a prediction for the dynamical evolution based on
visual input. Could brain construct this kind of representations of the external world?
One can imagine that the following iterative process leads to the ﬁnal percept. First the
visual data about external world deﬁne a 2-surface at retina belonging to the intersection
of real and p-adic worlds. This surface is mapped by using the proposed map or its suitable
variant to a neuronal image in the visual cortex and is partly photograph like and partly
hologram like. This image deﬁnes in turn a virtual visual input to retina giving again rise
to a 2-surface in the intersection. This process continues and leads to an approximate ﬁxed
point deﬁning the visual percept.
One can ask whether that cognitive self-maps and maps of the external world at the level of
human brain are basically realized by variants of this kind of mappings which can be regarded
as p-adic fractals perhaps even at the level of space-time surfaces. We indeed experience our life
as narrative and as having a purpose despite the fact that there is micro-temporal chaos which
suggests that this kind of maps could deﬁne cognitive representations even in 4-D sense. For
instance, long periods of life cycle could be mapped to short temporal intervals giving summary
of life cycle. Future plans are also included to this map. Interior to exterior mapping could
also gives bird’s eye of view about entire life perhaps becoming conscious in NDE experiences.
The map would provide a holistic view about the geometry of the partonic 2-surfaces deﬁning
space-time sheet.
An interesting basic feature of p-adics is that p-adic axis is analogous to non-negative real axis.
One can wonder whether this might have something to do with the asymmetry of the future and
past with respect to geometric memories. The fact that the evolution of the notion of negative
number has required quite a long time might correlate with the fact that the notion of negative
p-adic number is not well-deﬁned: if so, the limitations of our instinctive mathematical thinking
would directly reﬂect the properties of the p-adic numbers. The ability to imagine spaces of
arbitrary high dimension mathematically might correlate with the fact that p-adic space-time
regions can arbitrarily high algebraic dimension (as opposed to physical dimension) as algebraic
extensions of the p-adic numbers.
p-Adic cognitive representations should be extremely detailed (but faithful only above some
length scale) and contain immense amounts of unconscious-to-us information. Brain research
has indeed demonstrated that only part of sensory information is conscious-to-us.

510
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
The notion of pinary cutoﬀ
The subset of rationals common to given real and p-adic partonic 2-surfaces might be regarded as
a cognitive representation. In the intersection of real and p-adic worlds this number is maximal.
The set of all rational points of the real 2-surface is its inherent property measuring its cognitive
resources. The number and the average distance between rational points (common to the two
surfaces involved) would serve as a measure for the resolution of the cognitive representation.
Number theoretic braids provide a space-time correlate for the ﬁnite measurement resolution
realized in terms of inclusions of hyper-ﬁnite factors at quantum level.
The intersection of
number theoretic braid with the partonic 2-surface could be identiﬁed as a subset of rational
points.
The concept of pinary cutoﬀis crucial for the p-adic counterpart of the Negentropy Maximization
Principle [K44] . p-Adic negentropy vanishes identically when all entanglement probabilities are
rational numbers with a p-adic norm equal to one. The intuitive view is that if the p-adic norm
is smaller than one for all p-adic probabilities, then p-adic negentropy must also vanish. This
suggests that p-adic negentropy should be deﬁned using O(pk) = 0 for k > 0 pinary cutoﬀ. This
deﬁnition would ﬁx uniquely the notion of subcritical entanglement in the p-adic context.
One can present several justiﬁcations for why p-adic numbers are natural correlates of cognition
and why p-adic topology is tailor-made for computation. One possible justiﬁcation derives from
the ultrametricity of the p-adic norm stating that the p-adic norm is never larger than the
maximum of the norms of summands. If one forms functions of real arguments, a cutoﬀin
decimal or more general expansion of arguments introduces a cumulating error. Therefore to
achieve the desired accuracy one must perform calculation assuming that the number of digits
for the arguments of function is higher than the number digits required by the cutoﬀ, and drop
the surplus digits at the end of the calculation. One must be able to estimate how many steps
the calculation involves to determine the number of surplus digits. In p-adic case the situation is
diﬀerent. The sum for the errors resulting from cutoﬀs is never p-adically larger than the largest
individual error so that there is no cumulation of errors. Therefore there is no need for surplus
pinary digits for the arguments of the function. In practical computations this need not have
great signiﬁcance unless they involve very many steps but in cognitive processing the situation
might be diﬀerent.
10.2.5
Quantization phenomena in psychophysics
p-Adicity might provide understanding of some phenomena of psychophysics related to the
discrimination between diﬀerent intensities of stimuli and to threshold phenomena of sensory
perception. I am grateful to Robert Gazerro for telling me about these strange eﬀects.
(a) When over-learning occurs in tasks involving temporal discrimination, the memory images
about the intensity of sensation as a function of stimulus deviates from smooth logarith-
mic form in small scales by becoming piecewise continuous function [J71] such that the
plateaus where response remains constant are octaves of each other. This suggests that the
memory image about the sensation depends only on the 2-adic norm of the 2-adic image
of the ratio I/I0 of the intensity of the stimulus to the threshold stimulus under canonical
identiﬁcation.
This observation suggests a generalization inspired by 2-adic version of music metaphor.
Primary quale has multiple of cyclotron frequency as its correlate and, being integer val-
ued, is essentially 2-based logarithm of the 2-adic norm for the 2-adic counterpart of the
intensity of the sensory input. Hence the increase of intensity of the sensory input by
octave correspond to a jumpwise replacement of the n:th harmonic by n+1:th one and
should be seen in EEG. Our experience usually corresponds to the average over a large
number of this kind of primary experiences so that underlying 2-adicity is smoothed out.
In case of overlearning or neurons involved act unisono and the underlying 2-adicity is not
masked anymore. At the level of ELF selves this would mean generation of higher har-
monic when the number of nerve pulses per unit of time achieves threshold value allowing
the ampliﬁcation of corresponding frequency by the mechanism discussed already earlier.

10.3. Various aspects of cognition
511
There is a an analogous quantization eﬀect related to the discrimination of brightness
about which I learned from Robert Gazerro. If one compares brightnesses of object at
two subsequent values of time, one can distinguish the brightness diﬀerence if the ratio of
brightnesses is above 2. If one compares two objects simultaneously, one can distinguish
between brightnesses whose ratio even when it is below 2. This would suggest that cognitive
memory about brightness is coded by the 2-adic norm of 2-adic counterpart of brightness
whereas experience about brightness corresponds to a real number. Note that in case of
discrimination of a pitch of a sound situation is diﬀerent although also now two subsequent
frequencies can be discriminated only if they diﬀer by some minimum amount.
(b) According to Robert Gazerro, the resolution of the sensory experience seems to be of
order ∆I/I ∼1/100, where I is the intensity of the stimulus. When the signal-to-noise
ratio is below roughly 100 visual picture is regarded as having poor quality. The natural
order of magnitude estimate for the relative accuracy of p-adic cognition is ∆I/I = 1/p.
This number provides also an estimate for the relative accuracy of perception involving
real space-time sheets characterized by p-adic prime p. Since p = 127 can be interpreted
as p-adic prime associated naturally with genetic code, one might think that p = 127 is
fundamental p-adic prime in living matter. Thus a possible explanation of magic number
∆I/I ∼1/100 is in terms of 127-adicity.
10.3
Various aspects of cognition
10.3.1
p-Adic physics and imagination
p-Adic non-determinism makes it natural to interpret p-adic space-time sheets as geometric
correlates of intentions and cognitions. The wildest vision generalizing the memetics of Susan
[J36] [J37] is that the world is full so p-adic space-time sheets serving as geometric correlates
for plans, expectations, intentions,etc..
and waiting for their materialization to real space-
time sheets. Also new CDs of this kind would be created and disappear in quantum jumps.
Quantum ﬁeld theoretic interpretation for the creation of sub-CDs of this kind would be as
radiative corrections so that QFT approach would give also a quantitative approximate view
about the situation.
It would be natural to guess that p-adic physics is also physics of imagination but one must
very carefully deﬁne what this means. It seems that the transformation of the p-adic variants
of elementary particles, MEs and CDs to real ones sets only the initial values (with respect to
subjective time) of the neural activity leading to a generation of an imagined sensory experience
or motor action. If sensory organs are the seats of the primary sensory qualia, one can understand
imagined sensory experience as a perception, which does not start from the level of sensory
organs but some higher level and gives rise only to cognitive representations. Dreaming and
hallucinations would involve a feedback to the primary sensory organs ”qualiafying” the cognitive
representations. If motor action can be identiﬁed as a time reversal of the sensory perception
in a relevant time scale for MEs then imagine motor actions would diﬀer from real ones only in
that they would be initiated from some higher level than muscles.
10.3.2
How dreams and hallucinations relate to sensory experiences?
Dreams could be seen as processes in with cognition is transformed into sensory experience. This
would mean that the transformation of p-adic space-time sheets to real mind like real space-time
sheets initiates a process leading to imagination or dream depending on the situation. Clearly,
the generation of dream would be a process reverse to the generation of cognition from sensory
experience [K64] . If primary sensory qualia are realized at the level of sensory organs, then the
reversal process continues down to the level of the primary sensory organs and ”qualiaﬁes” the
cognitive mental images. Rapid eye movements and otoacoustic sounds would be a signature of
this qualiaﬁcation. Spontaneous movements during dreaming would in turn be the signature of
”qualiaﬁcation” of the imagined motor activities. This view about dreams as a de-abstraction

512
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
process have been represented already earlier and explains nicely the observations of Claude
Rifat about lucid dreaming [J115] .
The strange piecewise logical consistency of dreams is
indeed consistent with the p-adic non-determinism. De-abstraction process could be initiated
from some higher level of self hierarchy so that dreams could really be messages from higher
level selves.
This view about dreaming is in accordance with the observations (reviewed in [J121, J121] )
that dreaming is not produced by random inputs from brain stem to cortex but is cognitive
skill learned gradually during infancy.
The most primitive dreams represent static pictures,
then these pictures become dynamical, and at the age of about eight the dreamer becomes a
participant of the dream. In lucid dreaming the dreamer has taken active role in transforming
cognitive representations to sensory experiences.
One must actually distinguish between two kinds of ”hallucinations”: a genuine sharing of
sensory mental images involving no ”qualiaﬁcation” and interpretable as telepathy, and the
receival of cognitive information, which is then qualiaﬁed by the receiver like during dreaming.
The presence/absence of a feedback to the sensory organs allows to discriminate between these
options. The semitrance model for the bicameral mind is based on the idea that these experiences
are communicated by higher levels of the self hierarchy during semitrance. This communciation
could be purely telepathic.
10.3.3
Are cognitive representations generated from sensory input?
Brain certainly generates symbolic representations from the real sensory input and from p-
adic cognitive representations. Essentially a transformation of action to intention and of a real
symbolic representation to a p-adic cognitive representation would be in question.
(a) The transformation of action to intention could be seen as (subjective) time reversed
volition. This kind of process could serve as a healing and error correction mechanism.
(b) The experience of understanding accompanies naturally p-adic-real negentropic entangle-
ment. The transformation of symbolic representations to cognitive ones might be needed
for the purpose of understanding.
More generally, meaning might result only via the
symbolic to cognitive transformation.
(c) Symbolic representations could be enough to decompose the world to objects and actions.
Objects and actions would naturally correspond to real space-time sheets serving as cor-
relates for mental images (sub-selves).
On the other hand, one might argue that the
ultrametricity of the p-adic topology making p-adic world ’granular’ might be essential for
this decomposition into objects. A possible fundamental deﬁnition for an spatiotemporal
object could be as a region of p-adic space-time for which integration constants of ﬁeld
equations are genuine constants. This granularity should have also real counterpart and
p-adic fractality, possible realized as the invariance of the union of partonic 2-surface under
the variant of canonical identiﬁcation m/n →Ik(m)/Ik(n) already discussed, is a good
candidate for this correlate.
10.3.4
Cognition, sensory experience, and Boolean mind
Thoughts have not color and pure thoughts seem to be free of emotions, with aesthetic expe-
riences induced by abstract ideas being perhaps an exception. Pure thoughts involve often the
experience that something is true or false but not beautiful or ugly or right or wrong. These
simple observations provide tests for the identiﬁcation of the p-adic physics as physics of cogni-
tion and for the model of sensory qualia, Boolean qualia, and emotions. These observations also
lead to a concrete identiﬁcation of the physical realizations for the Boolean algebras of ethics,
aesthetics, and logics.

10.3. Various aspects of cognition
513
Does cognition have colors?
Sensory qualia have been identiﬁed as averages of quantum number increments associated with
the quantum jump sequence deﬁning the subself representing sensory mental image. Quantum
number increments relate to the quantum ﬂuctuating conﬁguration space degrees (WCW) of
freedom. The diﬃculties related to the deﬁnition of p-adic integral are magniﬁed in inﬁnite-
dimensional context. Unless one can reduce to integral to a sum or to an algebraic continuation
of its real counterpart in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds, one must assume that wave
functions have discrete locus also in p-adic WCW degrees of freedom.
If complete localization occurs in all p-adic conﬁguration space degrees of freedom in each
quantum jump, these degrees of freedom are purely classical and one cannot even speak of
quantum number increments in p-adic WCW degrees of freedom. There would be no p-adic
variants of sensory qualia and cognition would be colorless.
All p-adic conﬁguration space
degrees of freedom would be geometric degrees of freedom in the classical sense of the word.
One must of course take this kind of arguments very cautiously since the real mathematically
rigorous formulation of p-adic TGD in WCW degrees of freedom is lacking and also because the
assumption of this kind of asymmetry does not conform with number theoretical universality.
The possibility to use algebraic continuation might allow the perturbative formulation of the
p-adic TGD around the real maxima of K¨ahler function in the intersection of real and p-adic
worlds and p-adic WCW could be actually deﬁned in this manner by algebraic continuation.
Does cognition involve emotions?
It is a fact of neuroscience that emotions and information are closely related [J102] . I have
considered two views trying to mathematisize this ﬁnding.
(a) Emotions could correlate with the rates of change for the entropies associated with various
quantum number increments in quantum jump sequence determining self. If there are
no quantum number increments in p-adic WCW of freedom, corresponding emotional
component is absent from cognition.
In p-adic contex the deﬁnition of rate of change
for entropy is possible only if the p-adic value entropy is mapped to its real counterpart
by canonical identiﬁcation. Without this map one cannot assign emotions to p −p type
entanglement.
(b) Emotions could also correlate directly with the negentropy of the entanglement. Negen-
tropic subselves would deﬁne mental images with positively colored emotions and entropic
ones those with negatively colored emotions. In this case positive emotions -perhaps ex-
perience of understanding- would be associated with p-adic real entanglement and quite
generally with p1 −p2 entanglement for diﬀerent p-adic primes pi. For entanglement di-
agonal with respect to number ﬁeld also entropic entanglement would be possible [K44]
.
A naive view about three dichotomies
Beautiful/ugly, right/wrong, and true/false dichotomies relate to the comparison of experience
with some standard. Beautiful/ugly relates to sensory experience, right/wrong characterizes
deeds, and true/false logical statements. What comes in mind that these dichotomies could
be interpreted as Boolean qualia assignable to quantum jumps in purely fermionic degrees of
freedom.
(a) The ﬁrst guess is that these dichotomies could reduce to negentropic/entropic dichotomy.
If this makes sense, one can consider the following kinds of qualia of this kind correspond-
ing to entanglements of type R −R, p −p, R −p, and p1 −p2. For the ﬁrst to kind of
entanglements the emotional coloring could be either positive or negative. Could beauti-
ful/ugly characterize space-like diagonal entanglement with R-R and p-p corresponding to
sensory beauty and beauty of idea? Could right/wrong dichotomy correspond to time-like

514
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
R-R and p-p entanglement (deeds and intentions)? For the non-diagonal entanglement
the emotional coloring would be always positive and this might relate to experience of
understanding.
(b) This identiﬁcation does not explain true-false aspect.
The very naive idea is that the
reality is the positive standard which which to compare in case of p-adic quantum states.
If so then p-adic quantum states should be compared with reality. If the phase transition
transforming the quantum state to its real counterpart is possible then one can assign
to the p-adic quantum state the characteristic ’true’.
This is certainly not the case if
entanglement is genuinely padic and thus entropic so that also now the dichotomy would
reduce to negentropic/entropic dichotomy.
10.3.5
Replication of memes, and morphic ﬁelds
The notion of quantum teleportation is one of the ideas accompanying the development of the
theory of quantum computation. The notion of p-adic teleportation suggests itself very naturally
as a more ﬂexible mechanism of teleportation. p-Adic teleportation in fact provides a model
for the replication of memes and Sheldrake’s morphic ﬁelds can be seen as a generalization of
memetics in this framework.
Replication of p-adic cognitive representations
Memes are in central role in the theory of Susan Blackmore [J37] and p-adic space-time sheets
are excellent candidates for memes understood in a more general sense. Contrary to the vision
of Susan Blackmore, memes would be conscious selves rather than unconscious deterministically
behaving objects, and brain would not be an un-conscious machine used by memes but serving
as conscious transformation vehicle materializing cognitive representations to real action and
vice versa.
Although the notions of the meme and meme replication are very attractive, the mechanism of
imitation is only partially known. The so called mirror neutrons are certainly an important of
it. In the p-adic context learning by imitation could be understood as a two-step process. First
of all, a high-level p-adic cognitive representation is formed as in sensory perception. Secondly,
this representation is transformed back to motor action to yield an imitation. Thus it could
be that the enhanced ability to generate p-adic-to-real transformations in prima vista manner
distinguishes between humans and other species.
Time reversed cognition and reverse speech
Time reversed cognition and reverse speech are interesting phenomena allowing possibility to
test the theory.
1. Time reversed cognition
Time reﬂection yields time reversed cognitive representations.
The interpretation is as rep-
resentations of intentions if the sign of energy is negative. Also spatially reﬂected cognitive
representations could result in spatial reﬂections.
Same applies to symbolic representations.
The observation of these representations could serve as a test of the theory. There is indeed
some evidence for this rather weird looking time and spatially reversed cognition.
(a) I have a personal experience supporting the idea about time reversed cognition. During
the last psychotic episodes of my ’great experience’ I was ﬁghting to establish the nor-
mal direction of the experienced time ﬂow. Could this mean that for some sub-CDs the
standard arrow of time had reversed?
(b) The occurrence of mirror writing is well known phemonenon [J81] . Spatial reﬂections of
MEs are also possible and might be involved with mirror writing.

10.3. Various aspects of cognition
515
(c) Reverse speech would be also a possible form of reversed cognition. Time reversed speech
has the same power spectrum as ordinary speech and the fact that it sounds usually gibber-
ish means that phase information is crucial for storing the meaning of speech. Therefore
the hypothesis is testable.
2. Reverse speech
Interestingly, the Australian David Oates claims that so called reverse speech is a real phe-
nomenon [J24] , and he has developed entire technology and therapy (and business) around this
phenomenon. What is frustrating that it seems impossible to ﬁnd comments of professional
linguistics or neuro-scientits about the claims of Oates. I managed only to ﬁnd comments by a
person calling himself a skeptic believer but it became clear that the comments of this highly
rhetoric and highly arrogant commentator did not contain any information. This skeptic even
taught poor Mr. Oates in an aggressive tone that serious scientists are not so naive that they
would even consider the possibility of taking seriously what some Mr. Oates is saying. The
development of science can often depend on ridiculously little things: in this case one should
ﬁnd a shielded place (no ridiculing skeptics around) to wind tape recorder backwards and spend
few weeks or months to learn to recognize reverse speech if it really is there! Also computerized
pattern recognition could be used to make speech recognition attempts objective since it is a
well-known fact that brain does feature recognition by completing the data into something which
is familiar.
The basic claims of Oates are following.
(a) Reverse speech contains temporal mirror images of ordinary words and even metaphoral
statements, that these words can be also identiﬁed from Fourier spectrum, that brain
responds in unconscious manner to these words and that this response can be detected in
EEG. Oates classiﬁes these worlds to several categories. These claims could be tested and
pity that no professional linguist nor neuroscientist (as suggested by web search) has not
seen the trouble of ﬁnding whether the basic claims of Oates are correct or not.
(b) Reverse speech is complementary communication mode to ordinary speech and gives rise
to a unconscious (to us) communication mechanism making lying very diﬃcult. If person
consciously lies, the honest alter ego can tell the truth to a subself understanding the
reverse speech. Reverse speech relies on metaphors and Oates claims that there is general
vocabulary. Could this taken to suggest that reverse speech is communication of right
brain whereas left brain uses ordinary speech? The notion of semitrance used to model
bicameral mind suggests that reverse speech could be communication of higher levels of
self hierarchy dispersed inside the ordinary speech. There are also other claims relating the
therapy using reverse speech, which sound rather far-fetched but one should not confuse
these claims to those which are directly testable.
Physically reverse speech corresponds to phase conjugate sound waves which together with their
electromagnetic counterparts can be produced in laboratory [D7, D8] . Phase conjugate waves
have rather weird properties due the fact that second law applies in a reversed direction of
geometric time. For this reason phase conjugate waves are applied in error correction. TGD
based description of both electromagnetic and sound wave phase conjugation is based on negative
energy space-time sheets representing classically electromagnetic ﬁelds and Z0 ﬁelds [K22] .
Negative energy topological light rays are in a fundamental role in the TGD based model for
living matter and brain. The basic mechanism of intentional action would rely on time mirror
mechanism utilizing the TGD counterparts of phase conjugate waves producing also the nerve
pulse patterns generating ordinary speech. If the language regions of brain contain regions in
which the the arrow of psychological time is not always the standard one, they would induce
phase conjugates of the sound wave patterns associated with the ordinary speech and thus reverse
speech.
Space-time sheets near vacuum extremals are especially interesting biologically since they are
maximally critical [K14] .
Maybe the criticality is a prerequisite of criticality with respect

516
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
to the reversal of the arrow of psychological time. For vacuum extremals classical Z0 ﬁeld is
non-vanishing and em ﬁeld is proportional to it: γ = −sin2(θW )Z0. The large electroweak
symmetry breaking in living matter could be due to the classical Z0 ﬁelds generated by dark
matter identiﬁed in terms of the macroscopic quantum phases with so large value of Planck
constant that Compton lengths of weak gauge bosons are of order cell size scale or even longer.
If sound waves correspond to space-time sheets near vacuum extremals, the corresponding em
ﬁelds are proportional to Z0 ﬁelds unless Weinberg angle vanishes for them (this might be due
to the absence of electroweak symmetry breaking). This encourages to ask whether Z0 MEs
could serve as space-time counterparts of sound waves so that the strength Z0 electric ﬁeld
could determine the amplitude of sound wave.
A connection with the ideas of Sheldrake
In [K69] I have discussed a possible TGD based justiﬁcation of Sheldrake’s ideas about learning
at the level of species. The discussion can be easily rephrased in terms of p-adic cognition and
p-adic teleportation and leads to a more detailed variant of the original model.
If one assumes that memes correspond to p-adic cognitive representations, that the replication
of memes by zigzag mechanism is possible, and that MEs involved can have even sizes of order
Earth size, it is not too diﬃcult to imagine how species memory could be realized.
p-Adic
space-time sheets take the role of the morphic ﬁelds in TGD framework and represent habits,
skills, ideas,... Susan Blackmore would call these morphic ﬁelds memes but basically only a
naming convention and generalization is in question (amusingly, skeptics honourize Sheldrake as
a pseudoscientist but Blackmore as a serious scientist, perhaps because she has empasized her
skepticism in the publicity!).
The meme associated with the development of a particular skill could be realized in a particular
brain and replicate itself. When the replicas would encounter other brains of the same species by
p-adic teleportation, the skill could be manifested as a real action and lead to learning without
direct the mediation of a direct sensory communication. Sheldrake’s theory thus generalizes
memetics and thus make Sheldrake pseudo scientist.
That a given meme could be realized
only in brains of the same species might be understood in this framework by using resonance
argument: morphic resonance is the notion used by Sheldrake. It is also possible that stochastic
resonance [D6] to be discussed later in more detail could be involved with the morphic resonance.
The individuals that learned the habit ﬁrst, need not even live anymore since p-adic memes
remain and replicate by zigzag mechanism even when the physical body dies. Amusingly, TGD
predicts that the memes could travel also in the direction of geometric past so that also the
geometric past could learn the skill! Creativity would obviously correspond to the p-adic non-
determinism. Memes are continually changing and those which are transformable to real action
are realized and correspond to discoveries.
10.3.6
Learning
There are many forms of learning. Although the learning by associations is perhaps the simplest
form of learning, even logical reasoning might be basically rely on sequences of associations.
Learning by trial and error is second mode of learning. Imitation in in turn a higher, essentially
social, form of learning. Susan Blackmore believes that imitation is a characteristically human
form of learning and sees imitation as a replication of memes. There is however evidence that also
animals are able to imitate although imitation is certainly not the dominating form of learning.
p-Adic teleportation already discussed could be fundamental mechanism in this kind of learning.
Learning as construction of cognitive models is basic view of Piaget and of constructivists and
ﬁts nicely with the idea about p-adic physics as physics of cognition.
Associative learning
It is not clear whether there is any need to assign any cognition to these associations when they
occur completely automatically. The p-adic representations, if needed at all, for these associ-
ations A →B →... could be regarded as a space-time sheet consisting of deterministic pieces

10.3. Various aspects of cognition
517
representing A, B,... Perhaps the learning of rules A →B about the behaviour of the external
world might correspond to establishment of this kind of p-adic cognitive representations. The
generation of a model of the external would could also correspond to a formation of much more
detailed p-adic space-time sheets for which p-adic pseudoconstants are gradually transformed
to genuine constants. Only very limited amount of information about this p-adic world model
need become conscious.
Trial and error
At least higher level learning involves an evolution of a cognitive model. Learning by trial and
error is a good example of this. The naive expectation is that p-adic cognitive representation can
be transformed to real action if p-adic pseudoconstants are actual constants. If this is true, then
the learning of a skill by trial and error can be understood as a gradual development of a p-adic
cognitive representations such that p-adic pseudo constants become genuine constants. This is in
accordance with the fact that if skill is well-learned, a ’ﬂow-state’ in which performance is almost
unconscious and occurs ’naturally’ results. The testing of the learned skill serves obviously as
a feedback loop modifying the cognitive representation. This means changing the values of the
pseudo constants of the imagined p-adic action.
Constructivism
The basic vision of constructivism is that higher level learning means gradual construction of
cognitive representations, maps or schemes. This means that the world is seen as consisting of
objects and events classiﬁed into categories having mutual relations. Also a dynamical model of
world involving rules for the behaviour of the world develops. The ultrametricity of the p-adic
topology was proposed already by Parisi [B15] to make possible classiﬁcation of objects into
categories. p-Adic pseudoconstants deﬁne a natural division of p-adic space-time sheets into
four-dimensional objects (events). The emergence of the causal models is automatic and due to
the fact that p-adic physics obeys the same ﬁeld equations as the real physics.
Piaget entered by empirical means to his model of learning which is rougly the following.
(a) The ﬁrst two life years correspond to a sensorimotor period during which childs builds a set
of concepts about world and a model for how it works. During this period sensory world
and real world are identiﬁed (child believes that the object does not exist if it is not in the
visual ﬁeld). This period could be identiﬁed as period for the formation of symbolic p-adic
cognitive representations coding layman physics in terms of p-adic physics for cognitive
images of real world objects.
(b) During pre-operational stage (2-7 years), child is not yet able to conceptualize abstractly
and needs concrete situations.
(c) During the period of concrete operations (7-11 years) the child starts to conceptualize,
creating models that explain her physical experiences. Abstract problem solving becomes
possible: for instance, mathematical equations can be solved with numbers, not just by
using concrete objects (say counting by ﬁngers).
(d) During the period of formal operations (11-..) the cognitive abilities of child are like those
of adult. For instance, abstract reasoning and formal problem solving of mathematical
equations using abstract variables rather than only numerical values becomes possible.
Various stages in the development could be seen as gradual establishment of p-adic cognitive rep-
resentations based on reality testing leading gradually to relatively stable and realistic cognitive
representations.

518
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
Social aspects of learning
The social aspects of learning are certainly of utmost importance and higher level learning can
be also seen as a fundamentally social phenomenon. The notion of self-hierarchy suggests that
learning process occurs at several levels of self hierarchy simultaneously and involves communi-
cations between various levels. For instance, the learning of social behaviour and development
of a model of self as seen by others might involve this kind of interactions in an essential manner.
Imitation can be seen as an important mechanism of social learning: Susan Blackmore raises
meme replication as the fundamental process instead of learning. Sheldrake’s morphic ﬁelds
would make possible even more general form of learning. As far as p-adic cognition is consid-
ered, the same mechanisms are at work at each level and p-adic teleportation makes in principle
possible both meme replication and the learning at the level of species.
10.3.7
Some special aspects of cognition from p-adic point of view
In the following some basic aspects of cognition like the formation of concepts and classiﬁcation
into categories, long term memories, logical reasoning, and problem solving are discussed.
Formation of concepts
The most natural model for the formation of concepts is as temporal ensembles of suﬃciently
similar mind like space-time sheets (real or p-adic) deﬁning an ensemble of sub-sub-selves expe-
rienced as average subself (mental image). The idea about concept as average is is accordance
with the fact that conceptual thinking emerges gradually when child gathers experiences.
The observations of Claude Rifat [J115] about lucid dreaming suggest that lucid dreaming is a de-
abstraction process in which lucid dreamer goes one level lower in self hierarchy and experiences
the instances giving rise to a particular concept as separate mental images. For instance, the
experience of this kind could consist of a set of clocks seen by the subject person during some
period of his lifetime. This transformation would involve also p-adic-to-real phase transition
transforming cognitive representation to sensory image.
The basic question is whether conceptualization in the sense of classiﬁcation and averaging can
occur both at real and p-adic level. If one assumes that the world of pure sensory experience does
not consist of objects, then concepts emerge at cognitive level only and are averages over p-adic
sub-selves forming of p-adic subself. The averaging of purely sensory experiences represented by
real mind like space-time sheets would not give rise to anything useful in this picture. A more
general view is objects correspond to sub-selves of subself, and that concepts make sense at both
cognitive and sensory level. At sensory level emotions could be the counterparts of concepts and
emotional intellect would correspond to emotional conceptualization. Emotions indeed represent
in a well-deﬁned sense the average color of a pixel in a picture containing large number of pixels.
Thus cognition-emotions dichotomy would correspond to the p-adics-reals dichotomy.
How cognitive are long term memories?
It is known that purely visual memories have a very short duration whereas conceptualize visual
scene consisting of objects can be remembered for much longer time. This suggests that long
term memories are realized as p-adic space-time sheets rather than real sensory space-time
sheets. This would also explain why our sensory experience is located around a deﬁnite value
of geometric time whereas as conceptual memories are scattered around entire life cycle. There
are however also episodic, almost relived long term memories and these memories could be
perhaps regarded as genuine multitime sensory experiences perhaps resulting in p-adic-to-real
transformations of cognitive space-time sheets responsible for conceptual memories.
Of course, p-adic cognitive representations in principle make possible to scale down of the con-
ceptual representation of the entire life cycle in a fraction of second and it is an open question
whether conceptual memories result as averages of the p-adic sub-sub-selves over life cycle or

10.4. Frontal lobes and p-adic physics
519
whether temporal p-adic scaling contracting the lifehistory to a pocket size could be involved.
p-Adic fractality suggests the possibility of this kind of hologram like representation.
Reasoning based on temporal logic
p-Adic space-time surfaces allow representations of the temporal logic as rules of type A →B.
Various instances A could be represented symbolically as standard irreducible pieces of the p-adic
space-time surface characterized by genuine integration constants. Logical reasoning could be
based on the generation of this kind of surfaces. Reliability could be achieved by using ensembles
of this kind of surfaces representing causation sequences A →B →.... [K14] . Replication of
cognitive representation by the zigzag mechanism could generate ensembles of memes. These
sequences are by no means stable and can change in quantum jumps.
Thus some kind of
stabilizing mechanism is required. Perhaps some kind of reality testing mechanism based on
sensory input is at work. Logical consistency is a higher level test of this kind.
Problem solving
p-Adic cognition suggest a formal deﬁnition for the problem solving as a process in which one
tries to ﬁnd a p-adic space-time surface connecting initial p-adic space-time surface with the
ﬁnal one. This surface is constructed using some rules. In case of a learned skill this space-time
surface corresponds to p-adic constants which are genuine constants and thus realizable as real
space-time surface by phase transition. In case of a mathematical proof the p-adic space-time
surface would perhaps be constructed from standard pieces (symbols) with genuine integration
constants representing symbolically the steps of the deduction sequence and using the rules
A →B of the cognitive model of the mathematical system. A mouse in a maze might construct
and memorize by trial and error a p-adic cognitive representation of the maze with rules stating
which branchings lead to a dead end.
10.4
Frontal lobes and p-adic physics
p-Adic quantum entanglement with a positive entanglement negentropy is possible and is sta-
ble against self measurement if NMP holds true. This very encouraging ﬁnding suggests that
cognition is necessarily p-adic. For instance, it becomes possible to understand what it is to
understand! To have an experience of understanding is to have a p-adic subself (cognitive mental
image) with a positive entanglement negentropy.
Frontal lobes are regarded as seats of the highest mental functions such as cognition, intention,
volition, attention, evaluation of actions, self model, and perception of and reaction to social
situations. Long term memory and language are largely independent of frontal lobes whereas
working memory can be located to the dorsolateral parts of prefrontal lobes. Thus the concrete
model both p-adic physics of intention and cognition might boil down to a model of frontal lobe
function: presumably also the notion of ﬁeld body and magnetic cognitive canvas are needed
to understand the highest levels of the control. In particular, social control could be performed
basically by the multibrained collective selves by activation of social habit routines as suggested
by the fact that the persons who have lost these routines are able to deduce the correct social
behaviour.
10.4.1
Basic functional anatomy of frontal lobes
Frontal lobes involve the most complex association networks of brain. In fact so complex, that the
diagostics based on simple reﬂex schema and the idea about exact locations of mental functions
applied to subjects having serious frontal lobe damage suggested that frontal lobes have no
function at all! Only a view in which brain is regarded as self-regulating and self-organizing
system allowed to develop diagnostic tools revealing the eﬀects of frontal lobe damage.

520
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
Dorsolateral frontal lobes seem to be specialized with various aspects of cognition such as prob-
lem solving, judgement, reasoning, and discrimination. In particular, what is identiﬁed usually
as working memory is located here. These areas are also involved with imagination and corre-
sponding loops extend to sensory areas. In TGD framework dreams can be seen as a particular
kind of imagination in which imagined sensory features are mapped to the magnetic sensory
canvas.
The medial and ventral frontal lobes are involved with intention, planning, volition, and atten-
tion. These regions are also crucial for the routine perception of and reaction to social situations.
Aﬀect and motivation are crucial concepts here and the complex circuits connnecting frontal
lobes, amygdala/brain stem and cortex are essential for planning and decision making. Salience
detection or rather, selective ampliﬁcation of those aspects of percepts which are signiﬁcant
seems to be basic function of these loops. The lesion for these loops implies eﬀective loss of
volition as well as emotional ﬂatness.
Phineas P. Gage is a classic example of a person with serious damage for the circuits. He did not
lose either his intellectual abilities nor memory but lost the ability of planning and the access the
previously acquired social conventions and rules, and became childish and irresponsible. Gage
was also well aware that he did was not anymore able to react emotionally. Gage was also able
to use to theoretically deduce what would be the appropriate behaviour in social situations but
in everyday life this was impossible.
These ﬁndings suggest that frontal lobes perform high level control and habit routines are the
basic tools of cognition and planning, and that frontal lobes both active, generate, modify and
replace these habit routines by new ones. Using brain as computer metaphor one might say that
working memory provides the initial values of the parameters of the habit routines.
10.4.2
Some neurophysiological ﬁndings related to the functioning of
frontal lobes
The notion of cortical tone characterizes the state of cortex and is maintained by CNS. In
so called inhibitory phase state the tone is low and brain responds with similar response to
both strong and weak stimuli.
This phase is also called equalization phase.
In paradoxal
phase weak stimuli can give rise to strong responses and vice versa. In this state no organized
thought appeares and selective associations are replaced by non-selective and more or less random
associations. REM sleep is regarded as an example of paradoxal phase. The interaction between
medial frontal lobes, reticular activating system and cortex controls the cortical tone.
Gray Walter found that any expectation elicits characteristic slow waves emanating from frontal
lobes and spreading to other regions.
Expectancy wave diminishes if the the probability of
expected signal diminishes. When the instruction that elicited the expectation states is negated,
the wave ceases.
Similar wave phenomenon is detected during concentration, say during an
attempt to solve a complex mathematical problem. The interpretation as a correlate for binding
by quantum entanglement suggests itself.
Orienting reaction is a vegetative and electrophysiological reaction to stimulus. Constriction of
the vascular system to the arms, dilation of the vascular system to the head, galvanic skin changes
and alpha wave amplitude reduction are involved. Habituation to the simulus reduces orienting
reaction. Orienting reaction can be however increased and stabilized by verbal instruction that
links meaning to the stimulus. If frontal lobe lesion aﬀects attention, the orienting reaction fails
to be stabilized by this mechanism. The interpretation is that for polar, medial and mediobasal
section of the frontal lobe, the physiological tools for the regulation of attention are deranged.
10.4.3
TGD based view about frontal lobes
The TGD based model for how frontal lobes cognize forces some new interpretations of classic
experiments. Also a new view about working memory is unavoidable.

10.4. Frontal lobes and p-adic physics
521
Paper, pencil, and eraser metaphor
The unability to modify existing routines or replace them with new ones rather than loss of
these routines seems to accompany the lesions of ventromedial frontal lobes. Or more precisely,
new routines can be acquired but instantaneus replacement of active routines with new ones is
not possible. In a classic experiment already performed by Pavlovian school a person having
a frontal lobe lesion in the ventromedial area started to plane an plank and continued until
there was no plank anymore and continued ot plane the bench.
In the so called Wisconsin
card sorting test the subject is presented with a series of stimulus cards and a deck of response
cards. The cards bear coloured geometric patterns and can be matched by categories such as
colour, form or number. The experimenter selects category but does not inform subject person
who guesses rapidly the category by trial and error. After ten cards experimenter changes the
category without informing the subject person about the change. Patient is not able to revise
his strategy and continues to make wrong guesses.
These persons can adopt strategy but cannot change it. This is something very essential. The
proposed interpretation is however that these persons do not have motor imagination and there-
fore cannot construct new habit routine. This seems to be wrong since in the beginning card
experiment the subject was able to achieve this. Something more delicate is involved: patient is
not able to replace an activated strategy with a new one instantaneousy The activated strategy
however becomes deactivated spontaneously sooner or later.
This leads to pencil, paper, and eraser metaphor as a model for what frontal lobes are doing.
Creation of habit routines is creation of symbolic representations and frontal lobes both create
and erase habit routines just as we do when we do our calculations or type text to computer
ﬁle.
The patient with dorsolateral frontal lobe lesion must wait until the erasure happens
spontaneously to establish a new habit routine. Of course, stucking into habit routines seems
to a part of human condition, in particular at the old age.
Interestingly, during psychedelic experiences frontal lobes are very active. Habit routines are
what one gets rid in these experiences and also during meditation. The interpretation would
thus be that a very intense erasure of old and generation of new habit routines is going on.
Working memory quantum mechanically
The notion of working memory does not seem to be an appropriate concept in TGD framework.
The proper interpretation seems to be as erasure and replacement mechanism for habit routines.
Short term geometric and subjective memories are automatic side products. Mirror mechanism
is also now the natural mechanism for geometric memories but one cannot exclude the interpre-
tation of working memory as subjective memory. Note that it does not make sense to construct
long term memory representations of all intermediate stages of habit routine construction (just
as it does not make sense to publish all intermediate and often erratic stages of a long mathetical
calculation).
Erasure and replacement mechanism corresponds in spin glass metaphor to the kicking of the
system out from the bottom of a potential well. In quantum framework this means a formation
of a delocalized state in zero modes followed by a localization to the bottom of some other
potential well representing the new habit routine. Delocalized states in zero modes are however
not possible. Rather, a generation of a bound state implying a temporary transformation of
the zero modes in question to quantum ﬂuctuating macroscopic quantum degrees of freedom
is required. This is the TGD counterpart of Penrose-Hameroﬀmechanism. State of oneness,
quantum computing macro-temporally qcoherent system, moment of consciousness eﬀectively
lasting very many quantum jumps: all these characterizations apply to the resulting state.
The creation of new habit routine might even mean the changing synaptic connections. This
would mean a multiverse state of multineuron system with diﬀerent synaptic strengths such that
one of these states is selected when the bound state decays. Interestingly, it is known that the
synaptic connections related to the somatosensory representations of rat’s whiskers change in
an incredibly short millisecond time scale. The explanation as a macroscopic quantum eﬀect
strongly suggests itself.

Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
Also quantum superposition of entangled axons with varying membrane potentials near axonal
hillock and thus with a varying ﬁring probability could be considered. Also the ends of axons
might be in entangled quantum superposition: Ca++ waves and sol-gel transition might be
involved.
Cognitive quantum computation like processes at neurolevel
If one assumes that an eigenstate of the density matrix or of the negentropy operator results
in self measurement, the system must end up to an entangled state corresponding to some
eigenspace of the density matrix. The requirement that the increase of entanglement negentropy
is maximal, ﬁxes this eigenspace uniquely. For the resulting state density matrix is proportional
to unit matrix and entanglement negentropy is maximal NR = Nlog(p), when the number of
states is n = pNn0, n0 not divisible by p, N > 0: otherwise it vanishes. Quantum computers
indeed operate with systems for which entanglement probabilities are identical. A very strong
prediction is that the dimension of the state space should be divisible by pN.
A possible neurolevel realization of a cognitive quantum computation is following.
(a) Information is represented as a sequence of p-adic and real memetic qupits along axon. If
the eﬀective phase velocity ofME is suﬃciently low quite high number of qupits can be
realized as already found. Incoming p-adic and real memetic codewords can be taken to
be identical un-entangled sequences of p-adic and real memetic codewords. The unitary
time development is discrete with a time step of 1/1270 seconds and lasts an integer
multiple of T2(127) = .1 seconds (127 steps). Thus the minimal quantum computation
involves 2127 −1 quantum jumps eﬀectively glued to a single quantum jump by macro-
temporal quantum coherence. The outcome of the cognitive self-measurement is a pair
of memetic codewords representing the initial memetic codeword and the result of the
cognitive quantum computation.
(b) A conscious experience results, when the spin directions of the real oddball qubits ﬂip to
the direction of the external magnetic ﬁeld at the cell membrane space-time sheet. The
spatial sequences of qubits in the direction of the magnetic ﬁeld are excluded because
these states do not give rise to any spin ﬂips. In this manner a quantum computer with
p = 2127 −1 results. The spin ﬂips of the real qubits induce MEs which in turn induce
membrane oscillations and perhaps even nerve pulses.
10.4.4
Goal structures and emotions
Daniel Pouzzner has proposed quite an interesting theory of emotions relating most emotions to
cognitive models and goal structures [J107] . Goal structures are also cognitive models assumed
to have correlates at the level of neurophysiology.
Quite many emotions originate basically from comparisons of expectations or goals with reality
and Pouzzner’s model of emotions relates emotions to the dynamics of the goal structure. The
failure to reach a goal or giving up a goal is accompanied by a disappointment or sadness;
realization of a goal is accompanied by a feeling of success; fear or rage is experienced when the
achievement of a goal is threatened. The failure of a model is accompanied by a surprise; the
success of a model which has been questioned by experience involves a feeling of relief; etc..
There are of course exceptions: for instance, physical pain and pleasure, excitement, love and
perhaps also pure rage without any object. The basic question is whether the comparison type
emotion accompanies inherently comparison or whether emotions as such have nothing to do with
comparisons and brain has only evolved to associated emotions to comparison results to guide the
behaviour. In the model of Pouzzner the latter view is adopted and various neurotransmitters
are identiﬁed as correlates of emotions. The problem is to understand how cognitive models and
goals could be represented in real physics.
In TGD framework negative emotions relate to the increase of the entropies associated with vari-
ous quantum number and zero mode increments deﬁning qualia and are automatically generated

10.4. Frontal lobes and p-adic physics
523
by quantum decoherence. There are no emotions associated with cognitive (p-adic) degrees of
freedom unless one counts the experiences of understanding and lack of it as emotions. Positive
emotions relate to the decrease of these entropies. The formation of negentropic generating
sub-selves are obviously excellent candidates for quantum correlates of positive emotions. The
challenge is two-fold.
(a) Construct a concrete model for intentions and goal structures analogous to the model of
long term memories.
(b) Develop a model for the comparison process explaining why a quantum coherent subself
results if the mental images about the predicted and actual states of the world are nearly
identical and decohering subself results if these mental images are too diﬀerent.
p-Adic model of goal structures
The models for geometric memories and intentions should be very symmetrical the basic dif-
ference being that real numbers are replaced by p-adics and geometric past with the geometric
future in the model for intentions. This has nontrivial implications.
(a) Intentions and goals should correspond to time like p-adic entanglement of the brain of
the geometric now with the brain of the geometric future.
(b) It should be possible to speak about intention ﬁelds characterizing various brain cells
according to how long is the temporal distance T to the event of the geometric future
representing the intention. The cells corresponding to the highest values of T should be
found in frontal lobes.
(c) p-Adic counterparts of the gravitational MEs should be the entanglers unless one allows
necessary negentropic entanglement between real and p-adic systems. Perhaps the trans-
formation of real gravitational MEs emitted by systems with spin glass degeneracy to
p-adic ones can occur routinely.
In TGD cognitions and intentions should appear also at brain level and have deﬁnite corre-
lates. A good ﬁrst guess is that cognitive representations are realized using memetic code in
terms of MEs (of course, also em MEs might be involved). The construction of the symbolic
representations means the transformation of the p-adic MEs to real ones. The real MEs in turn
induce further symbolic representations in terms of time varying quark magnetization and cell
membrane oscillations or nerve pulse patterns.
How comparison type emotions could result?
The challenge is to understand how comparison type emotions could result from the compar-
ison of a p-adic cognitive model with the reality. What is needed is a concrete model for the
comparison process.
(a) The information about real world state is provided by sensory input represented as real
sub-selves whereas the prediction of the cognitive model is represented by a p-adic subself.
Therefore the real subself representing the relevant data must be transformed to a p-adic
subself.
Or alternatively, cognitive subself must be transformed to a symbolic subself.
Both transformations presumably occur and correspond to diﬀerent comparison processes
with diﬀerent outcomes at the level of conscious experience. The fact that p-adic physics
should not give rise to emotions plus the assumption that brain performs the comparison
more or less automatically, favours the comparison of the real mental images realized in
terms of nerve pulse patterns. It allows also to understand why emotions have deﬁnite
neurophysiological correlates.

524
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
(b) The comparison of symbolic (real) sub-selves generates an emotion: if two sub-selves are
identical, the emotion is positive. If they are too diﬀerent, the emotion tends to be negative.
In the comparison process the nearly identical real sub-selves representing the mental
images to be compared should be able to form a negentropically entangled state with a
high probability and this would give rise to a quantum coherent state accompanied by
positive emotion. Too diﬀerent sub-selves should not form negentropic state at all. The
increase of the various entropies of the unbound mental images quantum jump by quantum
jump should give rise to an emotions with a negative coloring.
(c) In p-adic context the formation of a state with positive negentropy should give rise to
an experience of understanding rather than positive emotion. The experience of under-
standing or lack of it would result in a comparison process in which a real mental image
representing real world is transformed to a cognitive one and compared with a p-adic
mental image representing a prediction of a cognitive model.
Comparison process at neuronal level
The fundamental comparison giving rise to comparison type emotions should be between nerve
pulse patterns representing symbolically the mental images. Nerve pulse patterns deﬁne asso-
ciation sequences, that is temporal sequences of space like 3-surfaces with time like separations
analogous to the words in a sentence. There should be some kind of resonant interaction between
two nearly identical nerve pulse patterns giving rise to bound states.
One can imagine two mechanisms.
(a) Transversal negative energy MEs created during the generation of the nerve pulse might
give rise to a bound state interaction between nerve pulse patterns propagating in parallel
axons.
(b) The second candidate for the resonant interaction relies on the TGD counterparts of non-
Hertzian scalar waves.
Both mechanisms could generate metabolic energy by buy now-pay later mechanism and the
observed anomalously low oxidative metabolism during syncrhonous ﬁring could be due to this
mechanism.
The non-Hertzian option deserves a more detailed discussion.
(a) TGD predicts a huge family of electret type solutions dual to magnetic ﬂux tubes charac-
terized by a constant density of K¨ahler action. Living matter is indeed full of liquid crystal
electrets, cell membrane being the basic example.
(b) The solution family contains also counterparts of the non-Hertzian scalar waves of Tesla.
These solutions represent a pulse of electric ﬁeld having a ﬁnite duration and spatial extent
and resemble MEs in the sense that they correspond to a ﬁnite space-time sheet moving
with light velocity. Electric ﬁeld is in the direction of propagation and almost constant.
(c) Non-Hertzian scalar waves are believed to be generated by short but very strong pulses of
electric ﬁeld. Nerve pulses certainly satisfy these criteria and could thus create scalar waves
propagating in directions orthogonal to axons and inducing a resonant interaction between
two nerve pulse patterns in parallel axons. This suggests that the comparison of two sub-
selves could involve join along boundaries bonds deﬁned by negative energy scalar wave
space-time sheets between parallel bundles of nerve ﬁbers. Topologically this mechanism
would not diﬀer from that based on negative energy MEs. If the nerve pulse patterns are
identical, the scalar waves give rise to a maximum number of join along boundaries bonds
responsible for the resonant interaction and representing the bound state energy. Neural
synchrony in millisecond time scale plus millisecond duration for the nerve pulses might
be enough to guarantee that this interaction mechanism works.

10.4. Frontal lobes and p-adic physics
525
(d) The energies involved would correspond to kHz scale and correspond to gravitational bind-
ing energies for cell sizes structures: note that non-Hertzian scalar are accompanied by
anomalously strong classical gravitational ﬁelds due to the facts that classical gravita-
tional ﬁeld couples to classical ﬁeld energy 108 times stronger than to ordinary matter and
that scalar wave space-time sheets carry very strong classical gravitational ﬁeld at their
boundaries.
10.4.5
Experimental support for binocular rivalry as a quantum phe-
nomenon
For years ago I constructed a quantum model for binocular rivalry and generalized it to a
general model of volitional act as a quantum jump selecting not only between alternative motor
actions but also between percepts.
In this model diﬀerent alternatives were represented as
superpositions of neural ﬁring patterns. The model allows to see sensory perception as an active
volitional process (at some level of hierarchy of selves) and explains sensory rivalry as a quantum
phenomenon.
The work of Efstratios Manaosakis
I learned from New Scientist [J86] that physicist Efstratios Manousakis has now published an
interesting work [J82] about binocular rivalry providing experimental support for this model.
Recall that the classical demonstration of binocular rivalry [J5] is a pattern experienced either
as a vase or two opposite faces. The two percepts alternate with some frequency and it is not
possible to consciously experience both patterns simultaneously. This has led Manousakis to
consider the idea that binocular rivalry could provide direct evidence for the notion of quantum
consciousness. The obvious idea is that either of the percepts results by a state function reduction
from the superposition of both percepts.
The model predicts that the ﬂip rate correlates with neuronal ﬁring rate. The prediction is
conﬁrmed by using as subjects persons who have a reduced ﬁring rate due to the use of LSD.
The work of Manousakis might turn out to be an important step of progress in the development
of theories of quantum consciousness and might help also main stream physicists to get rid of
their atavistic fears relating quantum consciousness.
Justiﬁcation for the model in TGD framework
The ﬁnding conforms with TGD view about quantum jump in which U process creates a quantum
superposition and state function reduction selects either of the percepts. TGD however brings
in new elements.
(a) In the conceptual framework of the standard quantum mechanics there is no known mech-
anism making possible macroscopic quantum coherence in the time scales involved. If dark
matter with large ℏis involved with the formation of conscious percept there is no problem
in understanding the time scales in question. Actually a hierarchy of rivalries of various
kinds in various time scales is predicted corresponding to the p-adic time scale hierarchy
and hierarchy of Planck constants.
(b) Another ingredient which is new from the point of view of standard quantum mechanics is
that the hierarchy of Planck constants implies self hierarchy actually identiﬁable actually
as a hierarchy of quantum jumps having quantum jumps within quantum jumps ..... The
fractal structure of state function reduction process means that it is possible have macro-
scopic quantum behavior in given time scale but dissipative self-organization in shorter
time scales.
This is actually not new: in hadron physics hadrons are described as quantum systems whereas
parton dynamics in the shorter time scales is assumed to be dissipative. In the recent case

526
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
this means the possibility of quantum superposition of dissipative self-organization processes
involved with the formation of neuronal correlates of percepts and proceeding in time scales of
order milliseconds considerably shorter than the time scale of binocular rivalry.
TGD based model for rivalry and its generalization
The TGD based quantum model for binocular rivalry relies on the idea that the formation of
quantum superposition of competing percepts is somewhat analogous to quantum computing in
which large number of quantum parallel computations are carried out and one computation is
selected as the computation halts.
In TGD framework one does not assign a conscious experience to the mere state function re-
duction part of quantum jump and the question arises whether the transitions periods are
experienced consciously as a kind of inability to disentangle what is there and if so what is the
subjective time duration of these periods and is it very short in absence of some other periodic
sensory input deﬁning a clock. The TGD prediction would be that the mental image deﬁned by
the percept is absent but consciousness is not lost.
The formation of quantum superposition of right and left percepts has evolutionary advantages
which suggest also a generalization to a model of volitional action as a selection between neural
ﬁring patterns leading to alternative motor actions.
(a) The formation of superposition would be metabolically advantageous.
In the classical
world one should form both right and left percept simultaneously. The associated self-
organization process requires a metabolic energy feed. When only single brain hemisphere
forms the percept and one has quantum superposition of right and left percepts metabolic
energy feed is reduced by factor 1/2. A highly synchronous neural ﬁring distinguishes the
perceived stimulus from non-perceived so that a quantum superposition of patterns of two
neural ﬁring patterns would be in question.
(b) This picture leads naturally to a proposal that one function of sleep is to make possible
quantum superposition of large number of neural ﬁring patterns via quantum entanglement
with external systems (perhaps other sleeping brains) so that sleep would be a process
analogous to quantum computation.
(c) The formation of alternative percepts would have an obvious evolutionary advantage in
a situation in which several percepts are consistent with the sensory input. For instance,
bipolar mood disorders seem to involve sticking of consciousness to either hemisphere.
This generalizes also to cognition: of course, percepts actually consist of sensory input
plus cognition.
(d) This framework is behind TGD based model of volitional action applying to both motor
actions and selection of sensory percepts. For a brain living in jungle it would be highly
advantageous to develop in a diﬃcult situation a quantum superposition of alternative
motor actions and select the proper one only at the eleventh moment.
(e) Sensory rivalry is analogous to an ability to move ﬂuently between - say - skeptic and
new age views about world. There is also a parallel at the level of society and in TGD
framework the rivalry of various views (religions, political parties, competing scientiﬁc
theories,...)
might perhaps be seen as counterpart of binocular rivalry at the level of
collective consciousness. The complete dominance of only single view - be it religious or
materialistic world view, market economy or communism, or super-string model or loop
quantum gravity - would be something comparable to a bimodal mood disorder.
10.5
p-Adic cognition at the level of DNA and proteins
I learned from Tidjani Negadi about some new ideas related to the attempt to understand the
basic numbers of the genetic code [A16] . Some of these ideas stimulated some speculations about

10.5. p-Adic cognition at the level of DNA and proteins
527
genetic code and its relationship to cognition and led to a discovery of two number theoretical
miracles related to the realization of cognition at DNA and protein level.
10.5.1
Symmetry breaking generates conscious information
What is very attractive in Negadi’s approach is the interpretation of the reduction of the entropy
in the symmetry breaking as information [A14] . This kind of a philosophy ﬁts nicely with the
general TGD based view about the generation of the macro-temporal quantum coherence.
(a) Macro-temporal quantum coherence corresponds to a formation of bound states and is
accompanied by a dramatic reduction of entanglement entropy since bound state entan-
glement is not entropic.
(b) The generation of macro-temporal quantum coherence involves a breaking of symmetry in
the zero mode sector transforming some zero modes to quantum ﬂuctuating zero modes.
On the other hand, state function reduction (localization in zero modes) and self measure-
ments giving rise to state preparation do not occur in bound state. The localization in
zero modes is counterpart of Higgs mechanism and its absence can be seen as the absence
of symmetry breaking induced by quantum jump. Hence the loss of symmetry at the level
of conﬁguration space is accompanied by a gain in symmetry at the level of conscious
experience and vice versa.
(c) In the p-adic context bound state entanglement is negentropic [K44] . This suggests that
the information resulting in the symmetry breaking involved with the establishment of the
genetic code could be realized as a conscious cognitive information associated with the
p-adic bound state entanglement.
10.5.2
Cognitive codes as a realization of the information generated
by DNA-protein symmetry breaking?
Before the establishment of the genetic code the assignments of DNA triplets to amino-acids are
random. This means that the symmetry group is a direct product of the permutation groups
permuting 64 DNA triplets and 20 amino-acids. The symmetry entropy is logarithm about the
number of elements of the symmetry group
Smax = log(w) ,
w = 64! × 20! .
(10.5.1)
One obtains Smax ≃4 × 61.8789.
The work of Negadi inspired the question about whether one could interpret protein-DNA sym-
metry breaking as a process in which the information I = Smax −S is generated and represented
in a concrete manner as an additional conscious cognitive information associated with DNA and
protein sequences. In case of DNA sequences the symmetry breaking is maximal so that one has
I = Smax. In case of protein sequences symmetry breaking is partial and I = Smax −S, where S
corresponds to the entropy due to the fact that DNA triplets coding for the same amino-acid are
equivalent from the viewpoint of protein. This means that DNA sequences carry more cognitive
information than protein sequences.
p-Adic physics as physics of cognition predicting that cognition is present already in elementary
particle length scales provides clues about how this additional information could be represented.
(a) p-Adic bound states for which kpN states entangle with similar states are automatically
quantum computer type states with identical entanglement probabilities (this guarantees
stability against self measurements [K44] . Most importantly, they carry positive entan-
glement entropy and genuine information. In the real context entanglement negentropy is
always non-positive and is assumed to vanish for bound state entanglement (of course, one
could criticize this assumption).

528
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
(b) If p is Mersenne prime: p = Mk = 2k −1, temporal sequences of k magnetization directions
for quark blocks provide a concrete mechanism of quantum computation (for k = 127
associated with the memetic code at least. This suggests that DNA triplets or amino-
acids could be accompanied by p = Mk-fold degeneracy resulting from the assignment of a
sequence of k blocks of magnetized quark blocks to each DNA triplet and/or amino-acid.
(c) This representation of information should relate somehow to the realization of the memetic
code in terms of DNA and amino-acid sequences.
In the model of the memetic code
sequences of 21 DNAs are a natural candidate for the realization of the memetic code
words since the number of diﬀerent sequences is 6421 = 2126, which is the number of the
memetic code words representing maximal number of mutually consistent statements in
the Boolean algebra represented by sequences of 127 bits. The sequences of 21 proteins are
a natural candidate for deﬁning the memetic counterpart of the DNA-protein translation
if one assumes that the translation of genetic code induces directly the translation of the
memetic code to proteins. A test is to ﬁnd whether sequences of 21 DNAs/proteins might
appear in the tertiary structure of DNAs/proteins.
(d) The argument above suggests that one should try to ﬁnd a representation of the cognitive
information by assigning a temporal sequence of p = Mk quark magnetization directions
to each DNA/protein in the the sequence of 21 DNAs/proteins. This representation makes
sense if the condition
I
=
21 × log(Mk) ≃21 × k × log(2)
(10.5.2)
giving
k
=
I
21 × log(2) ,
(10.5.3)
is satisﬁed for k Mersenne prime. The condition is obviously extremely restrictive and a
number theoretical miracle is required since k has exponential sensitivity to the value of
I. Even more, this miracle is required to occur twice: for both DNA and proteins!
10.5.3
M 2
7 and M17 codes
It turns out that the number theoretical miracle indeed occurs twice. The complete symmetry
breaking occurring at the level of DNA corresponds to the Mersenne prime M17 whereas the
partial symmetry breaking occurring at the protein level corresponds to the square of Mersenne
prime M7 deﬁning genetic code.
Is M17 code realized for DNA sequences?
In case of DNA sequences the symmetry breaking is complete so that one has I = Smax. For k
one obtains
k
=
17.0043 ≃17 .
(10.5.4)
k = 17 holds true with a relative accuracy of 2.5×10−4! Both Smax and I correspond to 357 bits
of information. What is fascinating is that M17 is indeed a Mersenne prime, even a very special
one, since k = 17 is the largest Fermat prime F4 = 24 + 1 = 17. Thus one has M17 = MF4,
somewhat analogously with the basic deﬁnition of Combinatorial Hierarchy: M(n+1) = MM(n).

10.5. p-Adic cognition at the level of DNA and proteins
529
Is M 2
7 code realized in case of proteins?
The DNA triplets coding for the same protein are equivalent from the point of view of proteins.
Therefore symmetry breaking reduces the symmetry group to the subgroup S2
1 ×S9
2 ×S2
3 ×S5
4 ×S3
6
of S64. Here the subindex n of Sn denotes the number of DNA triplets coding a given amino-acid
and the exponent m in Sm
n denotes the number the proteins with degeneracy n. The symmetry
entropy is in this case
S
=
log(2!9 × 3!2 × 4!5 × 6!3) = 4 ∗11.0584 .
(10.5.5)
Information gain in the symmetry breaking is I = Smax −S = 4 × 50.8205. The value of k for
proteinic cognitive representations becomes
k
=
13.9654 ≃14 = 2 × 7 .
(10.5.6)
k = 2 × 7 holds true with the relative accuracy of 8.5 × 10−4. k = 14 equals twice the Mersenne
prime 7 deﬁning Mersenne prime M7 = 27 −1 = 127 deﬁning the genetic code!
A p-adic
representation containing p2 states with k = 7 and p = M7 = 127 could be thus considered as a
realization of this code. There is internal consistency in the sense that the time scale .1 seconds
associated with the memetic code corresponds to a secondary rather than primary p-adic time
scale associated with M127.
M17 and M 2
7 codes as degenerate forms of the memetic code?
The natural guess is that M17 and M 2
7 codes represent degenerate forms of 127-bit memetic
code to 17- resp. 14-bit code, some kind of a predecessors of the memetic code. If so, then
the duration of the M17 and M 2
7 codewords is (roughly) the duration .1 seconds of the memetic
codeword.
(a) Internal consistency requires that the p-adic time scales in question can be regarded as
n-ary p-adic time scales for M7 and M17 for some value of n. For M7 one has M 36
7
≃M 2
127
in the approximation Mn ≃2n so that .1 seconds corresponds to 36-ary M7 time scale.
For M17 one has M 15
17 ≃2M 2
127 in the same approximation so that M17 corresponds to the
15 −ary M17 time scale equal to
√
2 × .1 ≃.14 seconds. The corresponding frequencies
are 10 Hz (mean alpha frequency) for M7 and 7.07 Hz for M17, which is just below the
alpha band and Schumann frequency 7.8 Hz and cyclotron frequencies 7.5 Hz for K+ in
magnetic ﬁeld .2 Gauss. This value of magnetic ﬁeld is suggested by the observations that
ELF ﬁelds have eﬀects on vertebrate brain at harmonics of Ca++ cyclotron frequency of 15
Hz. Note that Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld has nominal value of .5 Gauss so that the magnetic
ﬁeld assignable to the magnetic body would be slightly below the minimal value of Earth’s
magnetic ﬁeld about .3 Gauss.
(b) Single bit of M17 code would last τ = .14/17 ≃8.3 milliseconds. For M7 code the duration
of bit is τ = 14.3 milliseconds. It would be interesting to look whether electromagnetic
oscillations with roughly 121 Hz resp.
70 Hz frequency are involved with DNA resp.
protein dynamics and perhaps also with neuronal ﬁring.
(c) If one assumes that the duration .1 seconds is the precise duration of the memetic codeword,
the duration of a single bit is about 100/127 = .79 milliseconds. This would require that
the temporal distance between the nerve pulses realizing memetic codeword at neural
level is .79 milliseconds. It might be that brain is too slow to achieve this in its recent
developmental stage: M 2
7 −and M17 codes are however not problematic in this respect.
The representative capacity of the full memetic code is enormous: consider only the fact

530
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
that all ﬁles in the computer systems of world are planned to be named by 128-bit sequences
giving them kind of ﬁngerprints! Thus it might be that 17-bit or even 14-bit code is quite
enough: for instance, the number of phonemes of the spoken language is ridiculously small
as compared to the number of memetic codewords.
Interpretation of the memetic code word
The memetic codeword consisting of 127 bits allows elegant interpretation as an intention to
promote or inhibit the expression of DNA sequence of 21 DNAs coded by 126 bits. The last
bit tells whether the expression is promoted or inhibited.
Memetic code codes same things
as cognitive code for proteins but in a diﬀerent manner making it possible to activate genetic
expressions directly without the mediation of the information-molecule-receptor complex.
The model of the millisecond neuronal synchrony based on MEs suggests that memetic code
is not realized as nerve pulse patterns nor as miniature potentials but as oscillations of the
membrage potential. The model of nerve pulse and EEG leads to this same picture. One should
also notice that the duration of nerve pulses is somewhat longer than 1/1270 seconds so that
memetic code cannot be realized in terms of nerve pulses if the duration of codon is .1 seconds.
This oscillation could be transferred to nuclear membrane along micro-tubuli and induce in turn
the activation of genes coding promoters and inhibitors of the expression of some genes. The
realization of the memetic code in terms of nerve pulses would be degenerate. Frequency coding
suggests that only the number of nerve pulses per codon matters. If the average duration of
nerve pulse is about 2 milliseconds, the number of pulses is at most 64 and one would have
genetic code. Genetic code realized in this manner might well be enough to code the phonemes
of the language. There is also a second kind of frequency coding. If nerve pulses occur with a
constant interval between them (this could be induced by stochastic resonance, the degenerate
memetic codons would correspond to diﬀerent nerve pulse frequencies and also now a 6-bit code
would result.
10.5.4
Cognitive codes and bio-systems as molecular societies
The presence of cognition at DNA and protein level gives additional support for the vision about
bio-systems as a molecular society. In the following only the term cognitive code is used although
one should in principle speak about cognitive and symbolic codes.
Is p-adic cognitive information static or dynamical?
The general question is whether p-adic cognition degenerates to a representation of a static
information analogous to genetic information or does it represent a dynamic information. There
are several arguments supporting that the information in question is dynamical and that this is
what makes the soup of bio-molcules a molecular society.
(a) The basic character of the p-adic physics is non-determinism and it is diﬃcult to imagine
that cognitive representations could be static DNA like representations.
(b) The cognitive information at DNA and protein level is essentially like the cognitive infor-
mation at brain level and should be therefore highly dynamical.
(c) The fractality of consciousness suggest that one should look the situation at higher level.
In human society books represent static information analogous to that coded by DNA
whereas conscious brains carry dynamical information which is not a faithful copy of what
one can ﬁnd in books.
This view allows to answer to several related questions.

10.5. p-Adic cognition at the level of DNA and proteins
531
(a) M17 codeword would be a temporal sequence of 17 bits possibily represented in terms
of sub-CDs assignable to eleementary fermions. Note that M17 code would deﬁne 16-bit
sequences as maximal set of mutually consistent Boolean statements. M 2
7 codewords could
be represented as a pair of temporal sequences of 7 magnetization directions for fermions.
The maximal number of the statements consistent with given atomic statement would be
64 so that a cognitive version of the genetic code would be realized at the level of proteins.
Might it be useful for a protein to remember the DNA sequence which coded it? This
kind of information has no obvious relevance and conﬂicts with the dynamical character
of p-adic cognition.
(b) Is there a translation of M17 code to M 2
7 code analogous to DNA-protein translation in
which some information is lost and proteins carry part of the cognitive information carried
by DNAs? The ratio of cognitive information contents for protein and DNA sequences is
I(DNA)
I(protein)
=
log(M17)
2 ∗log(M7) ≃.822
(10.5.7)
whereas for DNA-protein translation it is log(21)/(6log(2)) ≃.7321. That proteins would
not carry independent cognitive information, would be in conﬂict with the dynamical
character of p-adic cognition. The only possible conclusion seems to be that one cannot
reduce biological information to the information represented at DNA level so that the
central dogma fails even in its generalized form.
Cell membrane as a cognizing structure?
The physical realization of the proposed cognitive codes deserves some comments.
(a) M17 resp. M 2
7 cognition would add an enormous amout of conscious information to genes
resp.
protein sequences.
DNA triplet resp.
amino-acid would contain 17 resp.
2 × 7
additional bits of cognitive information dominating over the chemically coded information.
This additional information might allow to understand the paradoxical ﬁnding that humans
and wheat have roughly the same amount of DNA if the number of DNA sequences longer
than 21 DNA triplets is higher in the human genome.
(b) The minimal length of 21 amino-acids corresponds to a minimal length of 21 nm for the
information molecule. Neurotransmitters and -modulators have lengths much shorter than
21 amino-acids. The molecular weights of hormones (in particular peptides) are measured
typically using 104 proton masses as unit and this means that the number of amino-acids is
larger than 21. Thus it would seem that very many peptides, regarded often as ’information
molecules’ and ’molecules of emotion’, could be regarded as intelligent messengers. Various
receptors of the information molecules associated with cell membranes have typically sizes
larger than the lower limit 21 nm and could thus behave as cognizing entities making
cell membrane an intelligent and cognizing structure. The number of receptors in the cell
membrane would serve as a kind of an intelligence quotient of the cell membrane.
10.5.5
Peptides as molecules of emotion and code of intentionality
The view about peptides and proteins as cognizing and intentional entities allows to translate
to TGD language often used expressions like ’emotions are expressed’, ’blocked emotions are
released’, ’emotions are stored to the body as traumatic body memories’, ’peptides are molecules
of emotion and information molecules’. Most importantly, a concrete code for intentionality
emerges in which elementary intention represents inhibition or facilitation of gene expression.

Unasked questions
The interactions of the information molecules involve the formation of receptor-information
molecule complex either at cell surface or in the cell plasma inside cell. Receptor-information
molecule complex inside cell can move to genome and induce gene transcription. In case that
the complex is formed at the surface of cell, second messenger action is involved. One can also
speak about N:th messenger action. There are many poorly understood aspects related to the
mechanisms of information molecule action [I27] .
(a) There are only few second messenger pathways and relatively few receptors but large num-
ber of diﬀerent functions. This phenomenon is known as pleiotropy or multi-functionality.
For instance, given second messenger causes diﬀerent eﬀects depending on the hormone
that activated it (the phenomenon is somewhat analogous to the phenomenon in which
message can be understood in several manners depending on the state of receiver).
At purely chemical level the problem is how second messenger knows what hormone ac-
tivated it? In steroid action the complex formed by information molecule and receptor
in turn activates some gene. Now the question is: How the activated RNA polymerase
knows which gene has to be activated? Pleiotropy appears also at level of hormones. Same
hormone can have multiple eﬀects and the border between hormone, neuropeptide or even
neurotransmitter is unclear. For instance, a hormone which by deﬁnition transmits long
distance communications, can have eﬀects in nearby cells and thus acts like a neuropep-
tide. How hormone knows what function it must perform? Also drugs and treatments can
have diﬀerent eﬀects and side eﬀects.
(b) There is also functional redundancy: the same function is performed by several second mes-
senger molecules. For instance, glucagon, growth hormone, adrenaline and corticosteroids
elevate glucose levels. This suggests that there is deeper level of communication involved
and that second messenger molecules are more like computer passwords than subprogram
calls. Now the question is: What these subprogram calls do correspond physically?
(c) Biological functions can be initiated also in nonchemical manner.
The phenomena of
healing by touch and the eﬀects of meditation and biofeedback are examples of biological
self-organization processes are initiated in nonchemical manner. Even other treatments
like massage, acupuncture or meditation can decrease or inhibit pain. These observations
suggest that chemical level is not the deepest level involved with biological functions and
the question is: What is this deeper control level?
Simple lock and key mechanism cannot provide answer to the questions raised above. If infor-
mation molecules carry p-adic intentions about say gene level expression of emotions, situation
changes since additional information transfer is involved.
The code of intentionality
The expressions of emotions are usually symbolic. Emotions involve often intentions (not always
benevolent!. This intention could be represented by p-adic MEs and translated to a symbolic
and cognitive representation in terms of real and p-adic antineutrinos (bit being represented by
the direction of magnetization). For instance, when the opinion of a quantum consciousness
theorist about reductionism and materialism cannot be expressed, the p-adic intention does
not transform to real ones and does not generate the nerve pulse patterns or other activity
responsible for the symbolic expression.
What it means that peptides are responsible for the expression of emotions? Perhaps information
molecules transfer the intentions to express emotions at molecular level between body parts. It
is indeed known that nervous system, immune system, and endocrine system are in an intense
information exchange using information molecules. Information molecule would literally act as
a postman transferring intentions to the proteins of the body which are also carriers of p-adic
cognition.

10.5. p-Adic cognition at the level of DNA and proteins
533
Emotions are eventually expressed at the gene level. M 2
7 code consists of sequences of 7-bits and
7 bits is enough to tell both the name of the gene and whether the expression of this gene is to
be facilitated or inhibited. Certainly the simplest possible biologically relevant intention is the
intention to facilitate or inhibit the expression of some gene! The doubling of the intention to
translate DNA sequence to protein brings strongly in mind the double strand structure of DNA.
There might be good reasons for the doubling to occur also at the level of intentions and 7-bit
sequences would represent DNA and its conjugate. Doubling might allow error correction as in
the case of double DNA strand.
If information molecules carry more or less standardized intentions, the intentions carried by the
information molecules cannot be directly transformed to actions. Rather, a process similar to the
translation of DNA to protein would occur. A copy of the second intention is formed (generation
of mRNA) and transferred near the nucleus where it is tranformed to action (translation of DNA
to protein). Of course, p-adic physics at protein level has also other aspects. Doubling would
make possible p-adic quantum computations at the protein level since 7-bit sequences could
entangle to form p-adic bound states. At DNA level p-adic quantum computations would be
made possible by the bound-state entanglement of the 17-bit sequences associated with the two
DNA strands: this would also partially explain why two strands are needed.
A model for what happens information-molecule receptor complex
There is evidence for M 2
7 code. It is known that membrane proteins are in a helical conformation
(so that the pair of p-adic intentions forms a helical structure just like DNA double strand!)
such that the number of proteins in the portion connecting the cell exterior and interior is
20 [I8] . This is not quite 21. It could be that the cell membrane space-time sheet is 5 percent
thicker than the join along boundaries condensate of the atomic space-time sheets so that 21
proteins are actually involved. A more plausible explanation is based on the observation that
the sequences of 10 × n DNA triplets are very special in that the net helical rotation along the
sequence is a multiple of 2π. Perhaps the sequences of 20 DNA and thus also of 20 amino-acids
carry the relevant genetic information. 21st amino-acid would contains a control intention which,
when realized, attaches the information molecule or receptor to the cell membrane such that the
follower of the control amino-acid is the ﬁrst one inside the cell membrane.
The interpretation would be that the portions of proteins inside cell membrane contain cognitive
antineutrinos. This interpretation conforms with the model of the memetic code based on the
assumption of almost zero energy neutrino pairs are assumed to have neutrino at k = 169
space-time sheet and antineutrino at k = 151 space-time sheet. There should be a k = 151
space-time sheet associated also with the information molecule making possible the realization
of memetic codewords. This is important constraint and could mean that the transversal size
of the information molecule is of order L(151) = 10 nm. Alternatively, the molecule to which
information molecule is bound during its travel to the target molecule could provide the k = 151
space-time sheet.
These ﬁndings allow to make guesses and questions about what might happen in the information
molecule-receptor complex.
1. Cell membrane-information molecule-receptor complex
The cognitively active parts of the receptors corresponds to the parts of these proteins traversing
the cell membrane. Often the receptors are proteins which traverse the cell membrane many
times and the interpretation would be that each portion of 20 amino-acids deﬁnes one elementary
intention deﬁning a portion of DNA sequence to be translated and initiating a process leading
to an expression of some gene(s). 7-bit code suggests that the codeword activates control genes
which promote or disfavor the expression of some gene(s). An interesting question is whether
DNA sequences consisting of 21 DNA triplets have some very special role in the control part of
the genome.
2. What are the contributions of the receptor and information molecules to the intention?

534
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
Does receptor molecule form only a copy about the intention of the information molecule to
the segments of the receptor going through the cell membrane or do both the receptor and
information molecule contribute to the intention? Could it be that the static quasi-static part
of the intention is coded by the receptor and the varying part is coded by the information
molecule?
Selection among not too diﬀerent intentions would give ﬂexibility without a loss
of safety. Quasi-static part would bring in some context dependence. This would allow also to
understand what happens in synaptic contacts: in the case of standard neurotransmitters, which
cannot be intelligent messengers because of their small size, there would be only a quasi-static
receptor contribution to the intention determined by the postsynaptic neuron.
3. How the intention to express the gene is realized?
Generalizing the ideas about the realization of the memetic code one ends up with the following
picture. The contribution of the information molecule to the intention is possibly copied in
the interaction with the receptor to the receptor molecule or transformed directly to action.
After the p-adic system is transformed to a real one and this process automatically generates a
sequence of electric signals when the spins of real antineutrinos ﬂip to the direction of magnetic
ﬁeld associated with the cell membrane space-time sheet.
This does not yield nerve pulses
but weaker signals, presumably completely analogous to miniature potentials generated in the
receptors of the postsynaptic neurons, and these potentials code for the gene expression. In
principle there would be no diﬀerence to what happens in the postsynaptic neuron.
Micro-tubular cytoskeleton which is piezoelectric structure claimed to allow 64 bit code [I24]
, [J91] could mediate the electric electric signal to the nucleus and activate the desired genes.
Massless extremals and TGD counterparts of scalar waves of Tesla could be involved. Recall
that scalar waves correspond to electric pulses propagating with light velocity with electric
ﬁeld in direction of propagation: now these pulses would propagate to the interior of the cell
and generate miniature potentials in the membrane potential of nucleus. The generation of the
second messenger would represent a standardized part (there are relatively few second messenger
pathways) of the process of realizing gene expression no responsible for the transfer of the
intention.
Failure to express emotions
It seems that the expression of emotions can fail at several levels. If the intention to express
emotion at brain level fails to be realized, information molecules are not generated and trans-
ferred around the body. The un-expressed emotion would be stored in the brain of the past.
The second possibility is that the intention to express emotion is transformed to action and the
peptides ﬂow around entire body but for some reason the intentions carried by the information
molecules are not expressed. For instance, the information molecules could fail to bind to their
receptors for some reason or the transfer of information inside thre receiving cell would fail for
some reason. In this case the unexpressed emotion would be stored to the body. In both cases
the 4-D body changes gradually more and more p-adic, and becomes full of unrealized intentions
and the carving of 4-D body, self-realization, is inhibited.
An important function of sleep and dreams might be the expression of the un-expressed emo-
tions of the geometric past. Also meditation and various therapies might have the same eﬀect.
Neuropharmacological approach, as long as it tries to aﬀect only the geometric now, cannot
change the geometric past and would not seem therefore very useful healing method for emo-
tional traumas. My own rather traumatic academic past provides a good testing ground for this
hypothesis. As a scientiﬁc heretic I lost my academic human rights for long time ago. It became
clear that if I react to this, I will be labelled as an asocial paranoid. Apart from few exceptions,
when the psychic pain was simply too intolerable, I managed to avoid this. This left a lot of
unexpressed emotion to my geometric past and the reward for a civilized behavior was a label
of a stupid sissy. Gradually it became also clear that there is no hope: the academic decision
makers have unlimited power. It is hard to imagine a more eﬀective mechanism for generating
deep frustration and long term depression! Gradually I however realized that the coin had also
the other side: the role of an academic zombie gave me an unlimited intellectual freedom which

10.6. What might be the basic principles behind molecular cognitive and sensory
representations?
535
those professors did not possess and I had actually ideal circumstances for carrying out my
mission optimally. Besides the incredible stupidity of the academic power holders I have been
wondering second strange phenomenon during these years. Why do I spend practically all my
dream time in my past? Could a partial answer be that I have been busily trying to express
these un-expressed emotions: during sleep it is easier to break the academic etiquette.
10.5.6
Questions relating to the M17 code
There are many questions related to the interpretation of the M17 code.
(a) What seems clear is that DNA double strands cognize and p-adically quantum compute
by bound state-entangling the neutrino sequences of the two strands: the nucleus is the
cognitive brain of the cell. 17 bits means much more information than two 7 bit sequences.
This suggests that DNA has emerged in the evolution after proteins, and also after cell
membrane, which results from self-organization and needs no coding. Also membrane pro-
teins can quantum compute when they are not making sex with the information molecules.
Cell is full of membranes and this maximizes the cognitive and intentional activities in the
protein sector.
(b) The realization of the DNA neutrino sequences requires the presence of k = 151 space-time
sheets. Cromosomes are indeed rather thick and there are helices inside helices indicative of
a hierarchy of space-time sheets. All the four space-time sheets characterized by Gaussian
Mersennes (k = 151, 157, 163, 167), could be carriers of cognitive antineutrinos whereas
neutrinos would reside at the k = 169 space-time sheet. Thus a four-levelled hierarchy of
cognition is in principle possible and perhaps partially realized by a hierarchy of helices
inside helices. The hierarchy of DNA helical structures could contain k = 151 and k = 157.
(c) The outcomes of DNA quantum computations can be interpreted as intentions which,
when realized, represent the result of the computation symbolically as the activity of the
organism and/or as a conscious experience at some level. There is no reason to assume that
these intentions would be realized only inside genome. Rather, they could be represented
MEs which are already earlier assumed to give an additional contribution to the genetic
information. Also the TGD counterparts of scalar waves of Tesla suggest themselves and
could transform this information to nerve pulse patterns by generating miniature potentials
ﬁrst. If the duration of the DNA cognitive codon is .14 seconds it is not clear whether
these intentions could relate to the ’features’, which have duration between .8-.12 seconds.
The corresponding frequency is about 7.1 Hz and slightly smaller than the nominal value
of Schumann frequency.
This information projected by MEs could be unconscious-to-
us and realized as magnetospheric sensory representations contributing to the conscious
experience of the multi-brained higher level selves. An interesting question relates to the
interpretation of the 17 bits of the cognitive codeword. It would be interesting to try to
ﬁnd evidence for features lasting about .14 seconds and modulated by sequences of 17
yes/no pulses.
10.6
What might be the basic principles behind molecular
cognitive and sensory representations?
The challenge of understanding how intentions and cognitions are realized at the molecular level
is a fascinating and potentially very rewarding challenge. The work with genetic and memetic
codes based on the notion of Combinatorial Hierarchy [K31, K40, K61] represents ﬁrst steps in
this direction but does not yet involve p-adic aspects. The ideas of preceding section provide a
lot of additional insight but do not provide any general theory. This section is devoted to an
attempt to develop a general theory of cognitive and symbolic representations at the molecular
level assuming that even molecular structures have intentions and cognition and are able to
transform intentions to actions.

536
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
The basic hypothesis is that molecules provide both static and dynamic symbolic representations
for cognitive codes. Cognitive codes are characterized by the symmetry groups of ﬁnite geome-
tries and their projective counterparts. The requirement that cognitive quantum computation
is possible raises the primes deﬁning Mersenne primes to a preferred position. The symmetry
groups of ﬁnite geometries are assumed to act as the symmetries of the molecular structures
responsible for the symbolic representations. This leads to strong predictions as some examples
treated below demonstrate and one might even speak about Golden Road to the understanding
of cognition and intentionality at molecular level.
10.6.1
Number theoretical ideas
The predictive power of the model to be proposed derives basically from number theoretical
constraints. Mersenne primes are in a unique position as far as p-adic quantum computation
is considered.
One can imagine a good reason for why Gaussian Mersennes should have a
unique role. Fibonacci numbers characterize often the structure of biological systems, and there
are reasons to believe that they might relate very intimately also to the evolution of cognitive
representations.
Mersenne primes an cognitive hierarchies
The ﬁndings about new cognitive codes initiated by the idea of symmetry entropy of DNA-
protein system can be compressed to a generalized notion of abstraction hierarchy, which was
introduced years earlier. Any Mersenne prime Mp, p prime deﬁnes an abstraction hierarchy
containing at most two levels. The 2p −1 elements of the ﬁnite ﬁeld G(Mp, 1) represent all
possible statements about p basic statements except the one which is not representable for some
physical reason. Hierachies start from some prime which is 2, 5, 13, 17, 19, 31, 89, 107 in the range
of p-adic time scales of interest and can have several levels.
(a) Combinatorial hierarchy p = 2, 3, 7 (single base pair), 127 (genetic code), M127 (memetic
code whose mutually consistent statements are realized also as sequences of 21 DNAs) is
the longest hierarchy. It is not known whether MM127 is prime: Hilbert conjecture states
the entire inﬁnite hierarchy consists of Mersenne primes. This would mean that universe
possesses inﬁnite ability of cognitive abstraction.
(b) The next hierachy starts from prime 5 and contains three levels p = 5, M5=31, and
M31 = 231 −1 ≃2 × 109.
(c) The remaining known to me hierarchies are two-step hierarchies and any Mersenne prime
deﬁnes such a hierarchy.
The largest Mersenne prime hierarchy of this kind relevant
for human consciousness is M127 which is the p-adic prime characterizing electron and
memetic code. M521 is the next Mersenne prime and corresponds to a completely super-
astrophysical time scale.
i) The ﬁrst abstraction pair (p, Mp) corresponds to p = 13. Micro-tubuli are excellent
candidates for the realization of M 13
13 representations with 132 = 169 bits of information
(recall that k = 169 characterizes the p-adic length scale associated with neutrinos!).
ii) Next Mersenne Mp prime corresponds to p = 17 and was deduced by the argument re-
lating to the information gain in complete symmetry breaking of the DNA-protein system.
iii) Also the Mersenne primes Mp associated with p = 19, 31, 61, 89, 107 should be there.
The beauty of Mersenne representations is that one can construct from them product represen-
tations containing M k
p cognitive states and bits replaced by pinary digits Mp. Furthermore, by
fractality any time scale 2pm/2TMp is possible for suﬃciently small primes p so that these rep-
resentation can be present in and a wide spectrum of time scales ranging from the time scales
relevant for the conformational dynamics of molecules to the time scales relevant for neural
activity and EEG and even time scales measured in years.

10.6. What might be the basic principles behind molecular cognitive and sensory
representations?
537
What about Gaussian Mersennes?
The Gaussian Mersennes Gn = (1 + i)n −1, n some prime, are expected to be also of fun-
damental importance and one expects that they give rise to complex cognitive representa-
tions. The Gaussian Mersennes possibly relevant to life correspond to primes n = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11,
19, 29, 47, 73, 79, 113, 151, 157, 163, 167, 239, 241, 283. The length scale range between cell mem-
brane thickness and size of small bacterium contains only Gaussian Mersennes: they are n =
151, 157, 163, 167. The norm squared of the Gaussian Mersenne Gn=2k+1 is pn = 221+1+2k+2+1
and larger than 2n.
One might guess that the number of Gaussian integers with norm smaller than the norm squared
of Gaussian prime Gn deﬁnes the number of states in this kind of representation and that
this number must be prime. Some very beautiful cognitive structures might be involved with
Gaussian Mersennes and it remains to be found what this structure is. Obviously the idea that
one could use sequences of n bits to realize pn = 2n−1 points as phase transitions by spontaneous
magnetization to an analogous representation of pn=2k+1 = 22k+1 + 2k+1 + 1 points. One can
write pn in a form which gives hints about what kind of physics this representation might require:
pn=2k+1 ≡N1 + N2 + N3 ,
N1 = 22k+1 −1 ,
N2 = 2 × 2k −1 ,
N3 = 2 × 2 −1 .
pn is sum over numbers of magnetization phase transitions for three phases of the fermion system.
N1 corresponds to a system of 2k + 1 fermions. N2 corresponds to a system consisting of one
fermion plus k Cooper pairs: by the indistinguishability of fermions the combinatorial factor k
is absent from N2. N3 corresponds to a system consisting of one fermion and a Bose-Einstein
condensate of all k Cooper pairs behaving like a single particle. Neutrinos at k = 169 space-time
sheet suggest themselves strongly as a realization of this phase.
Fibonacci numbers and the evolution of cognition
Fibonacci numbers proliferate living matter (logarithmic spirals) and emerge in the simplest
models of growth: living matter is full of logarithmic spirals and also micro-tubular structure
involves the sequence 3, 5, 8, 13 of Fibonacci numbers. The natural guess is that Fibonacci num-
bers are also involved with cognitive growth and evolution: especially so if this biological growth
is basically intentional and involves growth of plans from rough sketches to more detailed ones
and if this development is seen in the structure of intention. In particular, 21 DNA/protein
codeword could decompose to ordered hierarchy of subsequences of 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 DNAs and
these sequences with increasing length gradually give better and better representation of code-
word. The development of the full cognitive code word or intention, would be like an interactive
growth of a population of 21 cognitive organisms, primitive intentions associated with single
DNA. Older unit intentions react to the presence of new ones by generating new unit of inten-
tion each. When, say, a generation consisting of 5=2+3 unit has been established, 3 units of
previous generation generate new units (5+3=8) as a response to the presence of new 2 units.
For intance, single micro-tubule would represent only the 13 ﬁrst DNAs and would not give
faithful coding of the codeword. The wall of a double micro-tubule with 21 tubulin strands
at its wall would do it. Interestingly, triple micro-tubules seem to contain the total of 33 or
34 micro-tubules, whether the number is 34=21+13, the next Fibonacci in the micro-tubular
series, is not clear on basis of material that I have seen. Because of its Fibonacci structure of
micro-tubule could automatically represent 5, 8 and 13 DNA approximations to the full intention
represented by a sequence of 21 DNAs.
10.6.2
Representations
Representations are fundamental notions in geometry and physics and, as it seems, also sensory,
symbolic, and cognitive representations make sense. The basic idea is that Nature codes its

538
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
mathematical cognition to various kinds of symbolic representations. The fascinating possibility
is that practically every bio-structure which results in genetic expression represents some cog-
nitive/intentional structure somehow. We have been used to think that our theories represent
those structures we see: it might be fruitful to see the situation as just the opposite! DNA
and proteins would be only particular hardware realization of ﬁnite geometries associated with
cognition. This view might be general enough and certainly practical: one can deduce the sym-
metry groups associated with various structures and look whether one can assign them to ﬁnite
geometries or their projective counterparts and thus to p-adic cognition.
Various types of representations
One can distinguish between several kinds of representations.
(a) There are cognitive representations in terms of temporal sequences of p-adic neutrinos.
Sequences of 21 DNA triplets could realize any representation deﬁned by Mersenne prime
since the temporal character of the sequences means that the density of neutrinos needed
does not depend on the Mersenne prime. Thus there is no really deep reason for making
too restrictive assumptions at this stage.
(b) There are symbolic representations resulting when p-adic many neutrino states associated
with p-adic MEs transform to real ones. This transformation means transformation of
intention to action or cognitive representation to a symbolic representation. The realization
of this representation has been already discussed.
(c) The symbolic representations can transform further to dynamical representations as either
nerve pulses or oscillations of membrane potential. This representation generalizes: what
is needed are two-state systems in an external ﬁeld which forces a process analogous to
spontaneous magnetization.
(d) One can also consider the possibility of static geometric representations in terms of molec-
ular geometry. These kind of representations could be realized for any prime p and in case
that Mp is Mersenne prime, the structure characterized by p parts related by a cyclic sym-
metry Zp could serve as a template for dynamical representations obtained by attaching a
two-state system at every unit of the system. For instance, DNA triplets realize statically
the mutually consistent statements of M7 = 127 cognitive representation and single DNA
triplet could realize M3 = 7 representation if each basepair can be in two states. Clathrin
molecule gives 12-fold product of p = 5 representation in terms of 12 disjoint pentagon
faces whose vertices carry a two-state system (the polarization of the triskelion protein
could deﬁne the two states).
The basic principle for realizing dynamical representations
According to TGD inspired theory qualia, primitive qualia correspond to spin ﬂips, and more
generally, to phase transitions changing the direction of spin or some other quantity characteriz-
ing the state of the two-state system. In case of neutrino representations the essential elements
are the presence of magnetic ﬁeld, the fact that the neutrino is a two-state system which ﬂips
in the direction of externa magnetic ﬁeld, and the fact that the number of representable states
is Mn = 2n −1 rather than 2n states since the state in which all spins are parallel does not give
rise to spontaneous magnetization and conscious experience.
The replacement of single particle states with say spontaneously magnetized states guarantees
rigidity and robustness. Spin glass type phase is optimal for the representative purposes and
TGD universe is indeed a quantum spin glass.
Dynamic representations can be realized in
terms of molecular conformations instead of using ﬁelds. Micro-tubule representations provide
a fundamental example but there are a lot of others. If magnetic ﬂux tubes and electrets are
indeed fundamental building blocks of living systems (they represent fundamental solutions of
ﬁeld equations of TGD), living system should be a huge fractal collection of these representations.
Also cell membrane is expected to carry representations of this kind.

10.6. What might be the basic principles behind molecular cognitive and sensory
representations?
539
What this means is that the projective ﬁnite geometry with Mn + 1 = 2n points is represented
dynamically by n two state systems such that the point at inﬁnity is not realizable as spin ﬂip
pattern since it corresponds to the spontaneous magnetization or electret state in which all n
two-state systems have spin /polarization/... direction parallel to external ﬁeld and nothing
happens.
This is indeed what is required by the realization of qualia as quantum number
increments. At the level of set theoretical Boolean algebra representation the point at inﬁnity
corresponds to the empty set.
If the strength of the background ﬁeld can be controlled, the representation could be generated
by weakening the ﬁeld temporarily so that there results either a spin glass phase at criticality
optimal for the storage of bits or a phase above criticality optimal for signal propagation. The
transformation inducing ’spontaneous magnetization’ responsible for the conscious experience
could be generated by increasing the strength of the magnetic/electric ﬁeld to its original value.
For instance, in case of micro-tubular conformational representations reading would result by
introducing strong electric ﬁeld forcing the conformations to ground state conformations.
Magnetic ﬂux tubes and their electric duals provide these background ﬁelds. In case of magnetic
ﬂux tubes cyclotron transitions are these transitions and spins of Cooper pairs deﬁne the bits.
This allows a deeper understanding of also sensory representations.
Fractal hierarchy of time scales
The beauty of the realization of cognitive representation in terms of Mersenne primes is that all
fractal powers T(p, n) = p(n−1)/2Tp of p-adic time scale Tp are a priori possible and correspond
in good approximation to the square roots of the octaves of the fundamental time scale. The
ﬁrst implication is that the entire span of biologically relevant time scales can be realized using
relatively few fundamental time scales deﬁned by small Mersenne primes. This means also that
for large Mersenne primes corresponding to relatively long time scales there can be several small
Mersenne representations with essentially the same time scale. The signatures for these time
scales are resonance frequencies corresponding to the time scales deﬁning the duration of the
codeword and also the duration of single bit. How much the duration of the codeword can vary
around the p-adic time scale is still an open and important question: the width of alpha band
suggests that the variation is about ± 20 per cent.

Finite geometries and cognition
Finite geometries deﬁned by Galois ﬁelds G(p, n) with pn elements and identiﬁable as integers
in an algebraic extension of p-adic numbers modulo p and corresponding projective geometries
are the natural mathematical framework for simplest cognition. The primes p deﬁning Mersenne
primes M=2p −1 and Gaussian Mersennes and these primes themselves are preferred primes for
the reasons already explained.
(a) The evolution of mathematics represents the evolution of cognition since ontogeny recapit-
ulates phylogeny also at the level of cognition. This means that ancient mathematicians
constructed also models for the basic structures of cognition. The Platonic solids could
represent basic cognitive structures rather than only vice versa as it is usually thought.
(b) Symmetry group characterizes a given geometry. This group is cyclic group Zp for the
simplest ﬁnite geometries deﬁned by ﬁnite ﬁelds G(p, 1), p prime, and ﬁnite projective
group for for their projective counterparts obtained by adding the point at inﬁnity.
(c) One can interpret spatial and temporal sequences of quark magnetization directions as rep-
resenting points of ﬁnite geometries or their projective counterparts deﬁned by Mersenne
primes. The point at inﬁnity corresponds to all spins in the direction of magnetic ﬁeld so
that no membrane oscillation is generated: inﬁnity is un-reachable. Operational inﬁnity
is something which one is not able to achieve or perceive. This ﬁnding generalizes to a
more general representational principle using two-state systems in an external ﬁeld which
forces the two-state systems to the same state. The cognitive state is coded to a conscious

540
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
experience resulting in the phase transition to the ground state. If there are p two-state
systems such that Mp is Fermat prime this system codes the points of the ﬁnite geometry
Mp to conscious experiences.
If this view is correct, the mathematicians were studying their own cognitive consciousness
when they were proving theorems about Platonic and Archimedean solids or doing ruler and
compass constructions. In fact, I realized for years ago that Pythagorean triangles which pop up
naturally in p-adic context, represent the very early view about world as mere rational numbers.
The simplest mathematical cognition relies on ﬁnger counting: amusingly, decimal code pops
up already at the level of DNA: 10 DNA triplets correspond to a helical twist which is minimal
multiple of 2π.
Finite geometries
Ordinary ﬁnite geometry understood as having a structure of number ﬁeld involves only a set of
p (prime) ordered points deﬁning the ﬁnite ﬁeld G(p, 1) and subsets of points of this geometry.
The projective counterpart involves also the point at inﬁnity and contains thus p+1 points. Also
the algebraic extensions G(p, n) of G(p, 1) containing pn points are possible but not discussed
here. The symmetry group of the ﬁnite geometry G(p, 1) is cyclic group Zp and the sequences
of magnetization directions of p quark blocks represent the subsets of G(p, 1) as ordered sets. In
case of projective ﬁnite geometry containing also the point inﬁnity projective transformations
induced by 2 × 2 unimodular matrices

a
b
c
d

(10.6.1)
induce projective transformations via the formula
x →ax + b
cx + d .
(10.6.2)
By studying the unimodularity condition ad −bc = 1 in ﬁnite ﬁeld one easily ﬁnds that the
number of elements in the projective group is
N
=
(p −1) × [(p −1) × (p −2) + 4 × (p −1) + 2] /2 .
(10.6.3)
For p = 5 one obtains N = 60 corresponding to the number of vertices in truncated icosahedron
representing thus the symmetry group of 6-point projective ﬁnite geometry consisting of the
group A5 of even permutations of ﬁve objects. For p = 3 the number of elements is N = 224
and corresponds to the group S4 of permutations of four objects whereas for p = 2 the number
of elements is N = 6 and corresponds to the group S3 of the permutations of three objects.
The projective transformations of ﬁnite projective geometries are counterparts of Lorentz trans-
formations.
One can assign to ﬁnite geometries also a spinor structure.
Spinors have two-
components and the action of the projective transformation on the spinor is by matrix multi-
plication. It was actually this ﬁnding which led to the realization that there might be a deep
connection between cognitive representations using fermion sub-CDs and ﬁnite (projective) ge-
ometries.
Representations of ﬁnite geometries
An interesting question is what ﬁnite geometries can be realized as polygons in plane or as
Platonic or Archimedean solids. This requires that the symmetry group of the ﬁnite geometry or
of its projective counterpart acts as a subgroup of the rotation group O(3). For ﬁnite geometries
having Zp as a symmetry group regular polygons of plane with p vertices and edges provide this
realization. At molecular level a realization by helical twisting is natural. If the number of units

10.6. What might be the basic principles behind molecular cognitive and sensory
representations?
541
corresponding to a full helical twist of multiple of 2π is p or power of p one has a geometric
realization of a ﬁnite geometry.
1. Polygons obtainable by ruler and compass construction
Of special interest are the polygons which can be constructed using only ruler and compass: for
these structures lengths of various edges are either integers or involve iterated square roots of
integers. The well-known theorem of Euler states that the only structures of this kind correspond
to regular polygons with n vertices and sides of identical length having vertices at circle. The
allowed values of n are given by
n = 2k Y
k
Fk ,
where k is any non-negative integer and Fk is Fermat prime
Fk = 22k + 1 , k = 1, 2, 3, 4 .
The list of Fermat primes is 3, 5, 17, 287, 216 + 1. Interestingly, the lowest three Fermat primes
deﬁne Mersenne primes MFk so that they are expected to be of special interest from the point of
view of cognition. These structures are not ﬁnite geometries but could be regarded as Cartesian
products of ﬁnite geometries G(2, k) and G(Fi, 1). These structures can be seen as Cartesian
products of ﬁnite geometries.
A possible geometric representation of these structures is based on many-sheeted space-time so
that various factors in the decomposition correspond to diﬀerent space-time sheets characterized
by appropriate p-adic topology (also real space-time sheets are characterized by p-adic prime).
The hierarchical helical structures containing helices inside helices correspond to many-sheeted
space-time structures and the numbers of basic units corresponding to single period at various
levels could correspond to the prime factors appearing in the decomposition.
Bio-systems are full of helical structures. Five ﬁnger code and decimal code are included as
almost simplest codes. 10 DNA molecules deﬁne a structures for which the total helical winding
is multiple of 2π. Perhaps here is linear realization of the decimal code: that twist is multiple
of 2π indeed says that one can form from DNA a loop where that cyclic group of 10 elements
acts. One should look systematically through all helical structures and ﬁnd the number of units
which correspond to a minimal multiple of 2π rotation to see whether ruler and compass codes
are realized.
2. Quantized Planck constant, dark matter, and Fermat polygons
One ends up with Fermat polygons from the quantization of Planck constant as ℏ= λℏ0.
Number theoretical arguments suggest a general formula for the allowed values of λ [K24] as
λ = n where the integer n characterizes the quantum phase q = exp(iπ/n) characterizing Jones
inclusion [K92] . The values of n for which quantum phase is expressible in terms of squared roots
are number theoretically preferred and correspond to integers n expressible as n = 2k Q
n Fsn,
where Fs = 22s + 1 is Fermat prime and each of them can appear only once. The lowest Fermat
primes are F0 = 3, F1 = 5, F2 = 17, F3 = 257, F4 = 216 + 1.
The prediction is that also
n-multiples of p-adic length scales are possible as preferred length scales.
The p-adic vision about cognition suggests that algebraic extensions of p-adic numbers deﬁne a
cognitive hierarchy and the lowest levels of this hierarchy correspond to algebraic extensions of
p-adic numbers involving only iterated square root operation. These should emerge ﬁrst in the
evolution and therefore dark matter systems assignable to Fermat polygons should be the most
abundant ones.
There is a lot of evidence for the presence of integers characterizing Fermat integers in living
systems. For instance, the so called scaling law of [I2] [K32] states that radiation with frequency
fl is accompanied by a radiation with frequency fh ≃2 × 1011fl. The scaling factor 2 × 1011
corresponds with 1.5 per cent accuracy to the integer nF = 236 × 3 ≃2.03 × 1011 deﬁning a
Fermat polygon. This suggests an interpretation in terms of a decay of dark photon with a given

542
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
wave-length to a bundle of nF ordinary photons with the same wavelength. The energy of the
dark photon would be by a factor nF higher. This process could serve as an eﬀective tool of
bio-control. Dark photon could also transform to an ordinary photon with wavelength shorter
by factor 1/nF . Quite generally, integers nF deﬁning Fermat polygons are a reasonable guess
for the generalization of the scaling law of homeopathy and the search for these scaling factors
could provide an experimental means of identifying the values of Planck constant relevant for
living matter.
Even the time units of everyday life could reﬂect the properties of the dark matter hierarchy
responsible for the control of living matter, in particular those of the sub-hierarchy deﬁned by
Fermat polygons. Indeed, one year corresponds to nF = 4×3 months, one month to nF = 2×3×5
days, one day to nF = 8 × 3 hours, one hour to nF = 60 = 4 × 3 × 5 minutes, and one minute
to nF = 60 seconds.
3. Chromosomes and exotic quarks?
Helices within helices could give rise to hierarchies of cognitive representations. Magnetic ﬂux
tubes can have complex helices inside helices hierarchies and in this case the number of units
basically consisting of super-conducting ions or of their Cooper pairs per single period at given
level of hierarchy should be prime for a given loop.
Chromosomes are characterized by this kind of hierarchy of coiling and looping which helps to
pack chromosome DNA (about 2 meters in humans) in a small volume. This hierarchy could
give also make possible a hierarchy of cognitive codes corresponding to the space-time sheets
deﬁning the hierarchy. What makes this hierarchy so interesting is that the p-adic length scales
in question correspond to the miracle length scales deﬁned by Gaussian Mersennes corresponding
to k = 151, 157, 163 and 167. The diameter of the largest structure involved with chromosomes
is about .7 micrometers whereas the smallest structure has diameter of 11 nanometers. Thus all
three primary p-adic length scales k = 151, 157, 163 could be realized and three levelled hierarchy
is possible.
(a) If the principle of realization is same as for the memetic code based on the pair k = 127, 120
(electron CD containing a sequence of quark CDs), the following picture suggests itself.
k = 157 codon has n = 2157−151 = 64 bits of duration T(2, 151), k = 163 codon has n = 64
bits of duration T(2, 157), and k = 167 codon has n = 2167−163 = 4 bits of duration
T(2, 163).
The realization in terms of exotic light quarks quarks would involve only temporal se-
quences of n sub-CDs. The secondary p-adic time scales determining the time scale of
the corresponding CD and thus the time duration of codon are rather long: about 2 × 106
s for k = 151 and 108 seconds for k = 157. A test for this idea is whether the numbers
of the basic units per period of helix at various levels are given n = 32, 32, and 8 DNA
nucleotides (not that these numbers do not correspond to full number of codons).
(b) The realization analogous to genetic code would involve n = 157 −151 = 6 bits (genetic
code) , n = 163 −57 = 6 bits, and 167 −163 = 4 bits.
(c) One can also consider the possiblity that the number of bits is determined by the p-adic
prime characterizing the space-time sheet involved and thus equal to k = 151, 157, 163. In
this case the duration of bit would not correspond to a secondary p-adic time scale as it
does for the memetic code.
Realization of ﬁnite projective geometries using Platonic and Archimedean solids
For projective geometries the realization as Platonic solids in the sense that the projective
symmetry group acts as group of symmetries of the Platonic solid are possible only for p =
2, 3, 5 cases. The 5 Platonic solids are tedrahedron, cube and octhedron, and icosahedron and
dodecahedron. The basic transformation is duality changing faces and vertices. Tedrahedron (4
vertices and 4 faces) is self dual whereas cube (8 vertices and 6 faces) and octahedron (6 vertices

10.6. What might be the basic principles behind molecular cognitive and sensory
representations?
543
and 8 faces) are duals of each other, as are also icosadedron (12 vertices and 20 faces) and
dodecahedron (20 vertices and 12 faces). The number of edges is ﬁxed by the Euler characteristic
of sphere (solids are topologically spheres) given in terms of the numbers of vertices, edges, and
faces by V −E + F = 2 and one has E = V + F −2 giving for the number of edges E = 6, 12, 30
in the three cases respectively. Archimedean solids allow diﬀerent types of faces and hexagons,
octagons and decagons are possible (note that the number of vertices for faces is not prime
anymore). Archimedean solids have same symmetry groups as Platonic solids from which they
are obtained by ’truncations’.
It is interesting to look how the symmetry groups of ﬁnite geometries can be realized as sym-
metries of Platonic and some Archimedean solids.
(a) For p = 2 the group of projective symmetries corresponds to the 6-element group S3 of
permutations of three objects acting on triangle and being generated by 2- and 3-fold
symmetries.
The 3 vertices represent the 3 points of the projective geometry and the
generator of Z2 acts as a reﬂection permuting any pair of these points with the third
point representing the point at inﬁnity.
The three faces of tedrahedron give rise to a
representation of p = 2 ﬁnite geometry too. By assigning to each of these vertices a two-
state system one obtains a representation for M2. Tedrahedron allows M 2
2 representation
with information content of 4 bits.
(b) p = 3 projective geometry has four points and has the permutation group S4 of four objects
as a symmetry group. This group is the symmetry group of tedrahedron and the vertices
of any face realize the ﬁnite geometry with three points with the fourth vertex taking the
role of the point at inﬁnity. Also octahedron and cube having symmetry group generated
by 2-, 3- and 4-fold symmetries allow realization of the p = 3 ﬁnite geometry but not
an isometric realization of the projective geometry since the tedrahedron deﬁned by the
3 vertices nearest to a given vertex is not regular. 3-fold symmetries are rotations along
diagonals. M3 cognitive representation results by assigning to the 3 vertices of triangle,
tehdahedron or cube two-state systems.
(c) The symmetry group of p = 5 ﬁnite projective geometry and thus also the geometry are
represented by dodecahedron and icosahedron which are dual to each other by vertex-face
transformation, as well as by a truncated icosahedron, ’bucky ball’, having 60 vertices
and directly representing the projective group associated with the corresponding ﬁnite
geometry [A13] . This group is isomorphic with the group A5 of even permutations of 5
objects and contains 2-,3-, and ﬁve-fold elements. The coset space of A5/Z2×Z5 represents
the projective space and consists of 6 pairs of opposite and disjoint pentagons representing
the points of the ﬁnite projective geometry.
The points of the ﬁnite geometry are represented by a single pentagon as is clear from the fact
that the cyclic group Z5 acts on these pentagons) M5 representation results by assigning to the
vertices of any pentagon a two-state system. System allows actually much more: there are 12
disjoint pentagons so that M 12
5
code can be realized with information content of 60 bits! Thus
truncated icosahedron has an exceptional capacity for coding intentions and this might be the
reason for why it is the geometry of the clathrin molecules which take care of logistics in cellular
systems.
Platonic solids allow also lattice structures. Therefore cognitive structures allowing symbolic
representations in terms of molecular and lattice structures based on Platonic solids are expected
to be of fundamental importance.
These correspond to correspond to 2,3, and 5 bit codes
and Mersennes M2, M3, M5.
M2 corresponds to geometry of a line interval/triangle, M3 to
triangle/tedrahedron, and M5 to pentagon/icosahedron, dodecahedron or truncated icosahedron
depending on whether one requires projective extension or not. The codes would be represented
by assigning to the substructures representing the ﬁnite geometry a two-state system.
For
instance, electric polarization of the protein structure in electric ﬁeld at larger space-time sheet
could deﬁne the spinlike variable.
By using lattice like structure formed by basic units one
obtains products of representations of type M k
n.

Application of ideas to micro-tubuli and clathrin molecules
The proposed general principle allow to develop detailed views about what kind of cognitive
representations that various molecular structure can accommodate.
There is a considerable
freedom concerning the choice of the representative system and spin ﬂips or analogous transitions
can be ampliﬁed to magnetization type quantum phase transitions at higher levels of the self
hierarchy.
Micro-tubular representations
Micro-tubuli [J91, J96] are formed as hexagonal lattices of tubulin dimers on cylinder. The two
conformations of a tubulin dimer deﬁne the two states of the micro-tubular representations. In
an external electric ﬁeld along micro-tubule at the larger space-time sheet the second tubulin
conformation is unstable and the codeword is realized as a phase transition leading to the ground
state. Spontaneous electric polarization of all tubulins in the same direction forced by an electric
ﬁeld in the direction of the micro-tubule deﬁnes the ground state. The ground state itself cannot
give rise to conformational ﬂips and thus cannot deﬁne a codeword and one obtains M13 rather
than 213 codewords realizable as a signal resulting in the ﬂip to the ground state.
1.
Basic picture Micro-tubuli have helical structure: there are two helical strands with 13-
micro-tubule periodicity. A full 2π twist for a tubulin dimer strand corresponds to 13 dimers
and corresponds to vertical distance of 8 resp. 5 micro-tubules for the two arrays involved. Thus
a full 2π twist deﬁnes naturally the codeword and corresponds to 13-bit M13 codeword. Each
tubulin dimer strand deﬁnes a codeword: M 13
13 representations with an information content of
132 = 169 bits associated with single 13-plet of codewords results.
The small value of p = 13 means an extreme ﬂexibility concerning the duration of the cognitive
code word. All 213k/2 ∼90.51k multiples of T13 are possible. An interesting working hypothesis
is that the number N of the tubulin strands contributing to the codeword deﬁned by single
connected structure deﬁnes the duration of the codeword as T(N) = 2N×13/2T13.
(a) If the k = 21 micro-tubules at the wall of micro-tubule doublet contribute give rise to
the DNA representation, this rule would predict the duration of the code word to be
T = 2(21−13)×13/2T(169) ≃67.7 seconds with the duration of bit about 5.6 seconds,
which is somewhat longer than the mysterious time scale of 5 seconds associated with the
Comorosan eﬀect [K93] . k = 20 would give a codeword with a duration of .8 seconds
and with the duration of bit about 62 milliseconds. DNA should control the behavior
of micro-tubules in a rather long time scale (translation of single amino-acid takes 1/20
seconds) and these timescales sound rather reasonable.
(b) For triplets of micro-tubuli the number of tubuli in the wall is something like 29 and the
rule would predict completely unrealistic duration of the codeword about 107 years. It
seems that the time scale should be same as for doublet: note that only pairs of tubuli
have direct contact in the triplet.
(c) Micro-tubular representation would correspond to the duration T(132) = T(169) the cog-
nitive codeword which is about 1.7 × 10−14 seconds, which is much shorter than the time
scale of conformational dynamics and corresponds to the time scale of infrared transitions.
This time scale is considerably shorter than the time scale ∼.1 nanoseconds associated
with the protein conformational dynamics so that some other spin or rpolarization type
variable should deﬁne the representation if it is realized at all. Neutrino spin is an excel-
lent candidate in this respect. By increasing k = 13 to k = 15 gives time scale of order .1
nanoseconds. It seems that the working hypothesis could give rough ideas about orders of
magnitude but cannot be taken literally.
2. Cilia and centriole

10.6. What might be the basic principles behind molecular cognitive and sensory
representations?
545
Centriole resp. cilia are arrangements of micro-tubules containing 9 bundles of 3 resp. 2 micro-
tubules at the boundary of cylinder like structure and possibly also a doublet of micro-tubuli in
the center [J96] .
Micro-tubule doublets are associated with cilia crucial for the movement of monocellulars. Cilia
consists of nine micro-tubule doublets at the surface of cylinder and one doublet in the center:
also two separate micro-tubules are possible in the center. Some tubulin strands (usually three)
are lacking from the second fused micro-tubule. According to some sources, the total number of
tubulin dimer strands in doublet is 24 and 21 at the outer surface of doublet. 21 is Fibonacci
number associated with the micro-tubular sequence of Fibonacci numbers and also the number
of DNA triplets in cognitive codes. The complex of 21 tubulin dimer strands would be ideal for
coding of M13-bit sequences possibly associated with DNA or amino-acid sequences of 21 units
and containing 21 × 13 = 273 bits of information. The code words associated with the wall of
the cilium deﬁne M 9×21
13
representation with 13 × 9 × 21 = 2457 bits.
Centriole are crucial for the control of the movement of the cell and are present only in motile cells
(not in plants). If nucleus controls the movement of cell, centrioles and cilia should communicate
with DNA in both directions in the act of transforming intentions to actions. T shaped centriole
form an ideal antenna structure and could communicate both classically and quantally in terms
of MEs. Centriole have 9 micro-tubule triplets at the boundary of a cylinder. Various sources
give diﬀerent values for the total number of strands but it seems that the total number of
tubulin strands is about 33-34 and outer wall contains about 4 strands. Perhaps it deserves
to be noticed that the total number of strands is near to Fibonacci number 34 associated with
the micro-tubular sequence of Fibonacci numbers. In case of centriole the 9 fused triplets of
micro-tubules at the boundary each triplet containing about 33 tubulin dimer strands should
give rise to a representation M 9×33
13
with 13 × 9 × 33 = 3861 bits. Huge amounts of information
are involved.
3. Neuronal micro-tubuli
Neurons, which are not motile cells, do not have the usual T shaped centriole structure. Micro-
tubuli are however there and start from the region near nucleus and connect this region to
the dendrites and to the end of the axon.
The micro-tubuli associated with the axons can
be very long, up to millimeters and are connected together by MAPs, micro-tubule associated
proteins. This strongly suggests that micro-tubuli participate in an essential manner to neuronal
communications or to short term information storage. For instance, the propagation of the nerve
pulse could alter the electric ﬁeld of the micro-tubule space-time sheet temporarily and give
rise to spin glass state and thus induce representations of cognitive states in terms of tubulin
conformations. The return of the membrane potential to the normal value would induce the
conscious reading of the resulting representations. The minimal reason for this would be that
axonal micro-tubules are responsible for the transfer of neurotransmitters to the axonal end and
they must be cognizant about the overall nerve pulse activity.
Against the impressive representational capacity of micro-tubules the idea that nerve pulse
involves the transfer of only single bit of information seems weird. Rather, the picture about
micro-tubules would suggest that nerve pulse propagation are accompanied by a propagation of
conformational spin glass state in the depolarized portion of the axon carrying information, and
that one important function of the nerve pulse is to allow the propagation of the conformational
wave carrying the information. Of course, also cell membrane could carry informational wave
by same mechanism and one could see the events in the axonal membrane also as a realization
of p-adic intentions basically. An objection against this view is related to the problem how the
micro-tubular signal is transferred between micro-tubuli at MAPs. This is obviously needed
if information from micro-tubuli is transferred to postsynaptic neuron.
One must seriously
consider the possibility is that the information is received only by micro-tubuli and their form
an essential part of the conscious sensory pathway. This would explain why the lengths of micro-
tubuli associated with sensory pathways are maximized (the information from given side of the
body goes to the opposite brain hemisphere).

Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
Clathrin molecule and cognition
Clathrin molecule [J96] is involved with the transfer of various kinds of cargo through the cell
membrane and also through intracellular membranes. Even viruses use clathrin molecule coating.
Clathrin molecule induces a pit in the cell membrane and membrane pinches so that clathrin
molecule providing coating for a piece of cell membrane and containing the cargo ends up to
the cell interior. An area of cell membrane of football plane corresponding to that contained
by entire brain is generated during one hour when clathrins coat cell membrane containing
receptors and take it inside the cell. The generation of new cell membrane with this gigantic
rate should involve huge dissipative losses unless macro-temporal quantum coherence is involved
in the process.
Perhaps this argument alone convinces one day anyone about the presence of macro-temporal
quantum coherence in brain. Clathrin molecule has the geometry of a truncated icosahedron,
also the geometry of the soccer ball and fullerene or buckyball molecule C60 containing 60 carbon
atoms arranged to the vertices of the truncated icosahedron. In clathrin molecule carbon atoms
are replaced by three-legged triskelion molecules consisting of proteins. It is interesting to take
a more careful look on the geometry of truncated icosahedron deﬁning the geometry of the
clathrin molecule, if not anything else, the for the purpose to get a glimpse about the amazing
number theoretical regularities of this structure. Truncated icosahedron has 60=59+1 vertices,
90=89+1 lines, and 12=11+1 pentagonal and 20=19+1 hexagonal faces. Pentagonal faces are
disjoint. 6 pentagonal face pairs can be naturally interpreted as points of a ﬁnite projective
geometry associated with ﬁnite ﬁeld G(5, 1).
What it is interesting is that all these numbers are of form p+1, p prime. With one exception (59)
these primes also deﬁne Mersennes of Gaussian Mersennes. As a matter fact, the number of faces,
edges, and vertices are of this form for all Platonic solids and also for several Archimedean solids.
The interpretation in terms of a ﬁnite projective geometries suggests itself but the requirement
that the symmetries of ﬁnite geometry are realizable as rotations excludes this interpretation
since these substructures are not representations of the corresponding projective group realized
in terms of rotations. Of course, one must keep mind open for the possibility that the imbedding
of the symmetry group to rotation group is not necessary.
Clathrin molecule is an excellent candidate for a very eﬀective realization of molecular cognition
and intention.
If the triskelion proteins at the vertices of disjoint pentagons are electrically
polarizable, a dynamical M 12
5 representation with information content of 60 bits becomes possible
by controlling the electric ﬁeld at the space-time sheet at which the triskelions are condensed at.
This information could relate to the basic function of clathrin molecules but also the idea that
clathrin molecules transfer also information besides matter must be considered. For instance,
this representation could be involved with the transfer of not only the neurotransmitters but
also of (micro-tubular?) information from post- to pre-synaptic neurons.
What about cell membrane?
Cell membrane electric ﬁeld makes it ideal for the realization of cognitive representations. Lipid
molecules and membrane proteins are natural good candidates for representing the bit sequences
represented as two diﬀerent electric polarizations of proteins. The propagation of nerve pulse
could generate a representation during depolarization phase which would be read when mem-
brane potential has returned to its original value. The function of the nerve pulse would be thus
to inform entire axon consciously.
10.7
Intentionality, cognition, and number theory
The identiﬁcation of p-adic physics as physics of cognition and intention suggests strongly con-
nections between cognition, intentionality, and number theory. The new idea is that also real
transcendental numbers can appear in the extensions of p-adic numbers which must be assumed
to be ﬁnite-dimensional at least in the case of human cognition. This idea, when combined with

10.7. Intentionality, cognition, and number theory
547
a more precise model for how intentions are transformed to actions, leads to a series of number
theoretical conjectures. Also new insights about the number theoretical origin of the universal
dynamics of conformally invariant critical systems emerge. The earlier approaches to the proof
of Riemann hypothesis can be understood in a uniﬁed manner and the assumption that Riemann
Zeta exists in all number ﬁelds when ﬁnite extensions are allowed for p-adic numbers leads to
the view that that the zeros of Riemann Zeta correspond to the universal number theoretically
quantized spectrum of scaling momenta associated with critical conformally invariant systems.
10.7.1
Should one allow also transcendentals in the extensions of p-
adic numbers?
TGD inspired theory of consciousness leads to the identiﬁcation of p-adic physics as physics of
cognition and intention. This identiﬁcation leads to a rather fascinating new ideas concerning
the characterization of intentional systems.
The basic ingredient is the new view about numbers: real and p-adic number ﬁelds are glued
together like pages of a book along common rationals representing the rim of the book. This
generalizes to the extensions of p-adic number ﬁelds and the outcome is a complex fractal book
like structure containing books within books. This holds true also for manifolds and one ends up
to the view about many-sheeted space-time realized as 4-surface in 8-D generalized imbedding
space and containing both real and p-adic space-time sheets. The transformation of intention
to action corresponds to a quantum jump in which p-adic space-time sheet is replaced with a
real one.
One implication is that the rationals having short distance p-adically are very far away in
real sense.
This implies that p-adically short temporal and spatial distances correspond to
long real distances and that the evolution of cognition proceeds from long to short temporal
and spatial scales whereas material evolution proceeds from short to long scales.
Together
with p-adic non-determinism due the fact that the integration constants of p-adic diﬀerential
equations are piecewise constant functions this explains the long range temporal correlations
and apparent local randomness of intentional behavior. The failure of the real statistics and
its replacement by p-adic fractal statistics for time series deﬁned by varying number N of
measurements performed during a ﬁxed time interval T allows very general tests for whether the
system is intentional and what is the p-adic prime p characterizing the ”intelligence quotient” of
the system. The replacement of log(pn) in the formula S = −P
n pnlog(pn) of Shannon entropy
with the logarithm of the p-adic norm |pn|p of the rational valued probability allows to deﬁne a
hierarchy of number theoretic information measures which can have both negative and positive
values.
Since p-adic numbers represent a highly number theoretical concept one might expect that there
are deep connections between number theory and intentionality and cognition. The discussions
with Uwe K¨ampf in CASYS′2003 conference in Liege indeed stimulated a bundle of ideas allowing
to develop a more detailed view about intention-to-action transformation and to disentangle
these connections. These discussions made me aware of the fact that my recent views about the
role of extensions of p-adic numbers are perhaps too limited. To see this consider the following
arguments.
(a) Pure p-adic numbers predict only p-adic length scales proportional to pn/2l, l CP2 length
scale about 104 Planck lengths, p ≃2k, k prime or power of prime. As a matter fact, all
positive integer values of k are possible. This is however not enough to explain all known
scale hierarchies. Fibonacci numbers Fn : Fn + 1 = Fn + Fn−1 behave asymptotically
like Fn = kFn−1, k solution of the equation k2 = k + 1 given by k = Φ = (1 +
√
5)/2 ≃
1.6. Living systems and self-organizing systems represent a lot of examples about scale
hierarchies coming in powers of the Golden Mean Φ = (1+
√
5)/2. According to Selvam [H9]
also meteorological phenomena involve spiral waves characterized by Golden Mean.
By allowing the extensions of p-adics by algebraic numbers one ends up to the idea that also
the length scales coming as powers of x, where x is a unit of algebraic extension analogous
to imaginary unit, are possible.
One would however expect that the generalization of

548
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
the p-adic length scale hypothesis alone would predict only the powers √xpn/2 rather
than xkpn/2, k = 1, 2, .... Perhaps the purely kinematical explanation of these scales is
not possible and genuine dynamics is needed. For sinusoidal logarithmic plane waves the
harmonics correspond to the scalings of the argument by powers of some scaling factor x.
Thus the powers of Golden Mean might be associated with logarithmic sinusoidal plane
waves.
(b) Physicist Hartmuth Mueller has developed what he calls Global Scaling Theory [B3] based
on the observation that powers of e (Neper number) deﬁne preferred length scales. These
powers associate naturally with the nodes of logarithmic sinusoidal plane waves and cor-
respond to various harmonics (matter tends to concentrate on the nodes of waves since
force vanishes at the nodes). Mueller talks about physics of number line and there is great
temptation to assume that deep number theory is indeed involved. What is troubling from
TGD point of view that Neper number e is not algebraic. Perhaps a more general approach
allowing also transcendentals must be adopted. Indeed, since ep is ordinary p-adic number
in Rp, a ﬁnite-dimension transcendental extension containing e exists.
(c) Classical mathematics, such as the theory of elementary functions, involves few crucially
important transcendentals such as e and π. This might reﬂect the evolution of cognition:
these numbers should be cognitively and number theoretically very special. The numbers
e and π appear also repeatedly in the basic formulas of physics. They however look p-
adically very troublesome since it has been very diﬃcult to imagine a physically acceptable
generalization of such simple concepts as exponent function, trigonometric functions, and
logarithm resembling its real counterpart by allowing only the extensions of p-adic numbers
based on algebraic numbers.
(d) Number theoretic entropies measured in bits are proportional to log(p)/log(2). The idea
that these entropies are rational fractions of bit is attractive and implies that log(p) for
all primes is proportional to the same transcendental number.
This would mean that
logarithm of the rational number ﬁeld would be a transcendental multiple of rationals.
These considerations stimulate the question whether, besides the extensions of p-adics by alge-
braic numbers, also the extensions of p-adic numbers involving e, and perhaps even π and and
other transcendentals might be needed. The intuitive expectation motivated by the ﬁniteness of
human intelligence is that these extensions might have ﬁnite algebraic dimensions. On the other
hand, if one is only interested in quantities derived from phases exp(i2π/n), a ﬁnite-dimensional
algebraic extension is enough. π is needed only if one wants to deal with say length of circle’s
circumference in the p-adic context, and one could argue that p-adic Riemann geometry is local
and only about angles and inﬁnitesimal distances.
Second question is whether there might be some dynamical mechanism allowing to understand
the hierarchy of scalings coming in powers of some preferred transcendentals and algebraic
numbers like Golden Mean. Conformal invariance implying that the system is characterized by
a universal spectrum of scaling momenta for the logarithmic counterparts of plane waves seems
to provide this mechanism. This spectrum is determined by the requirement that it exists for
both reals and all p-adic number ﬁelds assuming that ﬁnite-dimensional extensions are allowed
in the latter case. The spectrum corresponds to the zeros of the Riemann Zeta if Zeta is required
to exist for all number ﬁelds in the proposed sense, and a lot of new understanding related to
Riemann hypothesis emerges and allows to develop further the previous TGD inspired ideas
about how to prove Riemann hypothesis [L1] , [H8] .
10.7.2
General number theoretical ideas inspired by the number the-
oretic vision about cognition and intentionality
The following two ideas serve as guide lines in the attempt to relate cognition, intentionality and
number theory to each other so that number theory would allow to construct a more detailed
view about the realization of intentionality and cognition. As a matter fact, the general ideas
about intention and cognition in turn generate very general number theoretical conjectures.

10.7. Intentionality, cognition, and number theory
549
(a) Real and p-adic number ﬁelds form a book like structure with pages represented by number
ﬁelds glued together along rationals forming the rim of the book. For the extensions of
p-adic numbers further common points result and the book becomes fractal if all possible
extensions are allowed. This picture generalizes to the level of the imbedding space and
allows to see space-time surfaces as consisting of real and p-adic space-time sheets belonging
to various extensions of these numbers. This generalized view about numbers gives hopes
about an unambigious deﬁnition of what some number, say e, appearing in an extension
of p-adic numbers really means.
(b) The ﬁrst new idea is roughly that the discovery of notion of any algebraic or transcendental
number x (such as Φ or e) involves a quantum jump in which there is generated a p-adic
space-time sheet for which the existing ﬁnite-dimensional extension of p-adic numbers is
replaced by a ﬁnite-dimensional extension involving also x. Also some higher powers of
the number are involved. For instance, for e p −1 powers are necessarily needed (ep exists
p-adically).
(c) The p-adic-to-real transition serving as a correlate for the transformation of intention to
action is most probable if the number of common rational valued points for the p-adic
and real space-time sheet is high. The requirement of real and p-adic continuity and even
smoothness however forces upper and lower p-adic length scale cutoﬀs so that common
points are in certain length scale range.
(d) The points of M 4
+ with integer valued Minkowski coordinates using CP2 length related
fundamental length scale as a basic unit is a good guess for the subset of M 4
+ deﬁning
the rational points of the M 4
+ involved. CP2 coordinates as functions of M 4
+ coordinates
should be rational or belong to some ﬁnite-dimensional extension of p-adics. Of course,
also rational points of M 4
+ are possible, and the evolution of cognition should correspond
to the increase of the algebraic dimension of the extension.
(e) A very powerful hypothesis is that the p-adic and real functions have the same analytic
form besides coinciding at the chosen rational points deﬁning the p-adic pseudo constant
involved. Since the pseudo constant deﬁnes the corresponding real function in rational
points, there are indeed good hopes that the transformation of p-adic intention to real
action is possible.
This assumption favors functions which allow at some point (most
naturally origin) a Taylor series with rational valued Taylor coeﬃcients.
Is e an exceptional transcendental?
Neper number is obviously the simplest one and only the powers ek, k = 1, ..., p −1 of e are
needed to deﬁne p-adic counterpart of ex for x = n. In case of trigonometric functions deriving
from eix, also ei and its p −1 powers must belong to the extension.
An interesting question is whether e is a number theoretically exceptional transcendental or
whether it could be easy to ﬁnd also other transcendentals deﬁning ﬁnite-dimensional extensions
of p-adic numbers.
(a) Consider functions f(x), which are analytic functions with rational Taylor coeﬃcients,
when expanded around origin for x > 0. The values of f(n), n = 1, ..., p −1 should belong
to an extension, which should be ﬁnite-dimensional.
(b) The expansion of these functions to Taylor series generalizes to the p-adic context if also
the higher derivatives of f at x = n belong to the extension. This is achieved if the higher
derivatives are expressible in terms of the lower derivatives using rational coeﬃcients and
rational functions or functions, which are deﬁned at integer points (such as exponential
and logarithm) by construction. A diﬀerential equation of some ﬁnite order involving only
rational functions with rational coeﬃcients must therefore be satisﬁed (ex satisfying the
diﬀerential equation df/dx = f is the optimal case in this sense). The higher derivatives
could also reduce to rational functions at some step (log(x) satisfying the diﬀerential
equation df/dx = 1/x).

550
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
(c) The diﬀerential equation allows to develop f(x) in power series, say in origin
f(x) =
X
fn
xn
n!
such that fn+m is expressible as a rational function of the m lower derivatives and is
therefore a rational number.
The series converges when the p-adic norm of x satisﬁes |x|p ≤pk for some k.
For
deﬁniteness one can assume k = 1. For x = 1, ..., p −1 the series does not converge in
this case, and one can introduce and extension containing the values f(k) and hope that
a ﬁnite-dimensional extension results.
Finite-dimensionality requires that the values are related to each other algebraically although
they need not be algebraic numbers. This means symmetry. In the case of exponent function this
relationship is exceptionally simple. The algebraic relationship reﬂects the fact that exponential
map represents translation and exponent function is an eigen function of a translation operator.
The necessary presence of symmetry might mean that the situation reduces always to either
exponential action. Also the phase factors exp(iqπ) could be interpreted in terms of exponential
symmetry. Hence the reason for the exceptional role of exponent function reduces to group
theory.
Also other extensions than those deﬁned by roots of e are possible. Any polynomial has n roots
and for transcendental coeﬃcients the roots deﬁne a ﬁnite-dimensional extension of rationals.
It would seem that one could allow the coeﬃcients of the polynomial to be functions in an
extension of rationals by powers of a root of e and algebraic numbers so that one would obtain
inﬁnite hierarchy of transcendental extensions.
Does the integration of complex rational functions lead to rationals extended by a
root of e and powers of π?
These cold showers suggest that the best one might hope is that the numbers like log(p) and
log(Φ) could be proportional to some power π with a coeﬃcient which belongs to a ﬁnite ex-
tension of p-adic numbers containing e. This might make it possible to continue the theory to
p-adic context and also make very strong predictions.
The elementary diﬀerential and integral calculus provides important hints for as how to proceed.
Derivation takes rational functions to rational functions unlike integration since the integrals of
1/x and and 1/(1+x2) give log(x) and arctan(x) leading outside the realm of rational numbers.
One can go to complex plane and consider the integrals of complex rational functions with
complex rational coeﬃcients and here one encounters integrals over closed curves and between
two points. The rational approach is to consider rational complex plane, and ﬁrst restrict to
Gaussian integers which allow primes.
(a) The ﬁrst observation is that residy calculus for rational functions gives always integrals
which are of form 2πiq, q a rational number.
(b) The integral I =
R b
a dz/z, a = m1 + in1, b = m2 + in2 in turn gives
I = log(a/b) = 1

 log(m2
2 + n2
2) −log(m2


+i(arctan(n2/m2) −arctan(n1/m1)) .
(a) The strongest hypothesis would be that logarithm and arctan are also rationally propor-
tional to π so that all integrals of this kind lead to an inﬁnite-dimensional transcendental
extension of p-adic numbers containing π. The strong hypothesis cannot be correct. Con-
sider arcus tangent as an example. arctan(m/n) = rπ/s would imply tan(rπ/s) = m/n,
and this cannot hold true since it would imply that s:th powers of Gaussian integer n+im
would give an ordinary integer.
This would be also true for Gaussian primes and the

10.7. Intentionality, cognition, and number theory
551
decomposition of Gaussian integers as products of Gaussian primes would become non-
unique. There is this kind of uniqueness but this is due the units exp(iπ/4) and its powers.
Indeed, arctan(1) = π/4 and proportional to π.
(b) One can overcome this diﬃculty by replacing the ansatz with
arctan(q) = eq1(q)q2π
such that q1(q) is non-vanishing for q ̸= ±1 ± i corresponding to the units of Gaussian
primes. This ansatz is completely analogous to the ansatz for log(p). The beauty of this
ansatz would be that the imaginary parts for the integral of 1/(z −z0) between complex
rational points would be proportional to π irrespective of whether the integration is over
a closed or open curve. The real parts of complex integrals in turn would be proportional
to 1/π of log(p) ∝1/π ansatz holds true.
The requirement that complex integrals are powers of π could also mean quantization of topology
in TGD framework. For instance, the conformal equivalence classes of Riemann surfaces of genus
g are represented by period integrals of 1-forms deﬁning elements of cohomology group H1 over
the circles representing the elements of homology group H1. Restricting the cohomology to a
rational cohomology, the periods with standard normalization would be quantized to complex
rationals multiplied by a power of π. For surfaces characterized by a given power of π one might
perhaps perform the p-adicization ﬁnite-dimensionally by suitable normalizations by powers of
π.
p-Adicization of vacuum functional of TGD and inﬁnite primes
A further input comes from TGD. The basic challenge is to continue the exponent exp(K) of
the K¨ahler function to p-adic number ﬁelds. K can be expressed as
K =
SK
16παK
,
where αK is so called K¨ahler coupling strength and SK =
R
JµνJµν√gd4x is K¨ahler action, which
is essentially the Maxwell action for the induced K¨ahler form. The dream is that an algebraic
continuation from the extensions of rational numbers deﬁning ﬁnite extensions of p-adic numbers
allows to deﬁne the theory in various number ﬁelds. The fulﬁllment of this dream requires that
physically important quantities such as the exponent of K¨ahler function for CP2 extremal and
other fundamental extremals exist in a ﬁnite-dimensional extension of p-adic numbers.
1. What is the value of K¨ahler coupling strength?
The value of K¨ahler coupling strength is analogous to a critical temperature and can have only
discrete values.
(a) The discrete p-adic evolution of the K¨ahler coupling strength follows from the requirement
that gravitational coupling constant is renormalization group invariant [K27] .
When
combined with the requirement that the exponent of CP2 action is a power of prime, the
argument would give
1
αK(p) = 4
π log(K2) , K2 =
Y
q=2,3,...23
q × p
with αK(p = M127) ≃136.5585 and α/αK ≃.9965.
Note that M127 corresponds to
electron length scale. If the action is a rational fraction of CP2 action, and the extension
of p-adic numbers is by an appropriate root of p is enough to guarantee the existence of
the K¨ahler function.

552
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
(b) One can consider also an alternative ansatz based on the requirement that K¨ahler function
is a rational number rather than a logarithm of a power of integer K2. This requires an
extension of p-adic numbers involving some root of e and a ﬁnite number of its powers.
SR must be rational valued using K¨ahler action SK(CP2) = 2π2 of CP2 type extremal
as a basic unit. In fact, not only rational values of K¨ahler function but all values which
diﬀer from a rational value by a perturbation with a p-adic norm smaller than one and
rationally proportional to a power of e or even its root exist p-adically in this case if they
have small enough p-adic norm. The most general perturbation of the action is in the ﬁeld
deﬁned by the extension of rationals deﬁned by the root of e and algebraic numbers.
Since CP2 action is rationally proportional to π2, the exponent is rational if 4παK satisﬁes the
same condition. If the conjecture log(p) = q1(p)exp [q(p2)] /π holds , then the earlier ansatz
1/αK(p) = (4/π)log(K2) does not guarantee this, and 4/π must be replaced with a rational
number Q ≃4/π. The presence of log(K2), K2 product of primes, is well motivated also in this
case because it gives the desired 1/π factor.
This gives for the K¨ahler function the expression
K
=
Q
"
q1(p)exp [q2(p)] +
X
i
q1(qi)exp [q2(qi)]
#
S
SCP2
.
(10.7.1)
exp(K) exists p-adically only provided that K has p-adic norm smaller than one. For given p
this poses strong conditions unless one assumes that the condition S/SCP2 = pnr, r rational.
In the case of many-particle state of CP2 extremals this would mean that particle number is
divisible by a power of p.
For single CP2 extremal, the fact that p cannot divide q1(p) means that either Q contains a power
of p or the sum of terms is proportional to a power of p. Obviously this condition is extremely
strong and allows only very few primes. One might wander whether this could provide the ﬁrst
principle explanation for p-adic length scale hypothesis selecting primes p ≃2k, k integer, and
with prime power powers being preferred.
Since k = 137 (atomic length scale) and k = 107 (hadronic length scale) are the most important
nearest p-adic neighbors of electron, one could make a free fall into number mysticism and try the
replacement 4/π →137/107. This would give αK = 137.3237 to be compared with α = 137.0360:
the deviation from α is .2 per cent (of course, αK need not equal to α and the evolutions of
these couplings are quite diﬀerent).
Thus it seems that log(p) = q1exp(q2)/π hypothesis is
supported also by the properties of K¨ahler action and might lead to an improved understanding
of the origin of the mystery prime k = 137. Of course, one must be extremely cautious with the
numerics. For instance, one could replace 137/107 with the ratio of 137/log(M107 and in this
case the M107 would become an ”easy” prime.
2. Could inﬁnite primes appear in the p-adicization of the exponent of K¨ahler action?
The diﬃculties related to the p-adic continuation of K¨ahler function to an arbitrary p-adic
number ﬁeld and the fact that inﬁnities are every day life in quantum ﬁeld theory bring in mind
inﬁnite primes discussed in [K78] .
Inﬁnite primes are not divisible by any ﬁnite prime.
The simplest inﬁnite prime is of form
Π = 1 + X, X = Q
i pi, where product is over all ﬁnite primes. The factor Y = X/(1 + X)
is in the real sense equivalent with 1. In p-adic sense it has norm 1/p for every prime. Thus
one could multiply K¨ahler function by Y or its positive power in order to guarantee that the
continuation to p-adic number ﬁelds exists for all primes. Of course, these states might diﬀer
physically in p-adic sense from the states having Y = 1. Thus it would seem that the physics of
cognition could diﬀerentiate between states which are in real sense equivalent.
More general inﬁnite primes are of form Π = nX/m + n, such that m = Q
i qi and n = Q
i pni
i
have no common factors. The interpretation could be as a counterpart for a state of a super-
symmetric theory containing fermion in each mode labelled by qi and ni bosons labelled in

10.7. Intentionality, cognition, and number theory
553
modes labelled by pi. Also positive powers of the ratio Y = X/Π, Π some inﬁnite prime, are
possible as a multiplier of the K¨ahler function. In the real sense this ratio would correspond to
the ratio m/n.
If this picture is correct, inﬁnite primes would emerge naturally in the p-adicization of the theory.
Since octonionic inﬁnite primes could correspond to the states of a super-symmetric quantum
ﬁeld theory more or less equivalent with TGD, the presence of inﬁnite primes could make it
possible to code the quantum physical state to the vacuum functional via coupling constant
renormalization.
One could also consider the possibility of deﬁning functions like exp(x) and log(1+x) p-adically
by replacing x with Y x without introducing the algebraic extension. The series would converge
for all values of x also p-adically and would be in real sense equivalent with the function. This
trick would apply to a very general class of Taylor series having rational coeﬃcients. One could
also say that p-adic physics allowing inﬁnite primes would be very similar to real physics.
The fascination of inﬁnite primes is that the ratios of inﬁnite primes which are ordinary rational
numbers in the real sense could code the particle number content of a super-symmetric arithmetic
quantum ﬁeld theory. For the octonic version of the theory natural in the TGD framework these
states could represent the states of a real Universe. Universe would be an algebraic hologram in
the sense that space-time points, something devoid of any structure in the standard view, could
code for the quantum states of possible Universes!
The simplest manner to realize this scenario is to consider an extension of rational rational
numbers by the multiplicative group of real units obtained from inﬁnite primes and powers of
X. Real number 1 would code everything in its structure! This group is generated as products of
powers of Y (m/n) = (m/n)×[X/Π(m/n)] which is a unit in the real sense. Each Y (m/n) would
deﬁne a subgroup of units and the power of Y (m/n) would code for the number of factors of a
given integer with unit counted as a factor. This would give a hierarchy of integers with their
p-adic norms coming as powers of p with the prime factors of m and n forming an exception and
being reﬂected in p-adic physics of cognition, Universe would ”feel” its real or imagined state
with its every point, be it a point of space-time surface, of imbedding space, or of conﬁguration
space.
In fact, one can any pair of inﬁnite primes having ﬁnite ratio given by rational number can
be divided by the prime in question to give a unit in real sense. These units are not units in
the p-adic sense and have a ﬁnite p-adic norm which can be diﬀer from one. Inﬁnite primes
form an inﬁnite hierarchy so that the points of space-time and imbedding space can be seen as
inﬁnitely structured and able to represent all imaginable algebraic structures. Certainly counter-
intuitively, single space-time point is even capable of representing the quantum state of entire
physical Universe in its structure.
For instance, in real sense surfaces in the space of units
correspond to the same real number 1, and single point, which is structure-less in the real sense
could represent arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces as unions of real units. For real physics this
structure is completely invisible and is relevant only for the physics of mathematical cognition.
One can say that Universe is an algebraic hologram, and there is an obvious connection both
with Brahman=Atman identity of Eastern philosophies and Leibniz’s notion of monad.
10.7.3
Inﬁnite primes, cognition and intentionality
Somehow it is obvious that inﬁnite primes must have some very deep role to play in quantum
TGD and TGD inspired theory of consciousness. What this role precisely is has remained an
enigma although I have considered several detailed interpretations, one of them above.
In the following an interpretation allowing to unify the views about fermionic Fock states as
a representation of Boolean cognition and p-adic space-time sheets as correlates of cognition
is discussed.
Very brieﬂy, real and p-adic partonic 3-surfaces serve as space-time correlates
for the bosonic super algebra generators, and pairs of real partonic 3-surfaces and their alge-
braically continued p-adic variants as space-time correlates for the fermionic super generators.
Intentions/actions are represented by p-adic/real bosonic partons and cognitions by pairs of
real partons and their p-adic variants and the geometric form of Fermi statistics guarantees the

554
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
stability of cognitions against intentional action. It must be emphasized that this interpretation
is not identical with the one discussed above since it introduces diﬀerent identiﬁcation of the
space-time correlates of inﬁnite primes.
Inﬁnite primes very brieﬂy
Inﬁnite primes have a decomposition to inﬁnite and ﬁnite parts allowing an interpretation as
a many-particle state of a super-symmetric arithmetic quantum ﬁeld theory for which fermions
and bosons are labelled by primes. There is actually an inﬁnite hierarchy for which inﬁnite
primes of a given level deﬁne the building blocks of the inﬁnite primes of the next level. One
can map inﬁnite primes to polynomials and these polynomials in turn could deﬁne space-time
surfaces or at least light-like partonic 3-surfaces appearing as solutions of Chern-Simons action
so that the classical dynamics would not pose too strong constraints.
The simplest inﬁnite primes at the lowest level are of form mBX/sF +nBsF , X = Q
i pi (product
of all ﬁnite primes). The simplest interpretation is that X represents Dirac sea with all states
ﬁlled and X/sF +sF represents a state obtained by creating holes in the Dirac sea. mB, nB, and
sF are deﬁned as mB = Q
i pmi
i , nB = Q
i qni
i , and sF = Q
i qi, mB and nB have no common
prime factors.
The integers mB and nB characterize the occupation numbers of bosons in
modes labelled by pi and qi and sF = Q
i qi characterizes the non-vanishing occupation numbers
of fermions.
The simplest inﬁnite primes at all levels of the hierarchy have this form. The notion of inﬁnite
prime generalizes to hyper-quaternionic and even hyper-octonionic context and one can consider
the possibility that the quaternionic components represent some quantum numbers at least in
the sense that one can map these quantum numbers to the quaternionic primes.
The obvious question is whether conﬁguration space degrees of freedom and conﬁguration space
spinor (Fock state) of the quantum state could somehow correspond to the bosonic and fermionic
parts of the hyper-quaternionic generalization of the inﬁnite prime. That hyper-quaternionic (or
possibly hyper-octonionic) primes would deﬁne as such the quantum numbers of fermionic super
generators does not make sense. It is however possible to have a map from the quantum numbers
labelling super-generators to the ﬁnite primes. One must also remember that the inﬁnite primes
considered are only the simplest ones at the given level of the hierarchy and that the number of
levels is inﬁnite.
Precise space-time correlates of cognition and intention
The best manner to end up with the proposal about how p-adic cognitive representations relate
bosonic representations of intentions and actions and to fermionic cognitive representations is
through the following arguments.
(a) In TGD inspired theory of consciousness Boolean cognition is assigned with fermionic
states. Cognition is also assigned with p-adic space-time sheets. Hence quantum classical
correspondence suggests that the decomposition of the space-time into p-adic and real
space-time sheets should relate to the decomposition of the inﬁnite prime to bosonic and
fermionic parts in turn relating to the above mention decomposition of physical states to
bosonic and fermionic parts.
If inﬁnite prime deﬁnes an association of real and p-adic space-time sheets and this associ-
ation could serve as a space-time correlate for the Fock state deﬁned by conﬁguration space
spinor for given 3-surface. Also spinor ﬁeld as a map from real partonic 3-surface would
have as a space-time correlate a cognitive representation mapping real partonic 3-surfaces
to p-adic 3-surfaces obtained by algebraic continuation.
(b) Consider ﬁrst the concrete interpretation of integers mB and nB. The most natural guess
is that the primes dividing mB = Q
i pmi characterize the eﬀective p-adicities possible
for the real 3-surface. mi could deﬁne the numbers of disjoint partonic 3-surfaces with
eﬀective pi-adic topology and associated with with the same real space-time sheet. These

10.7. Intentionality, cognition, and number theory
555
boundary conditions would force the corresponding real 4-surface to have all these eﬀective
p-adicities implying multi-p-adic fractality so that particle and wave pictures about multi-
p-adic fractality would be mutually consistent. It seems natural to assume that also the
integer ni appearing in mB = Q

code for the number of real partonic 3-surfaces with
eﬀective qi-adic topology.
(c) Fermionic statistics allows only single genuinely qi-adic 3-surface possibly forming a pair
with its real counterpart from which it is obtained by algebraic continuation. Pairing would
conform with the fact that nF appears both in the ﬁnite and inﬁnite parts of the inﬁnite
prime (something absolutely essential concerning the consistency of interpretation!).
The interpretation could be as follows.
i) Cognitive representations must be stable against intentional action and fermionic statis-
tics guarantees this. At space-time level this means that fermionic generators correspond
to pairs of real eﬀectively qi-adic 3-surface and its algebraically continued qi-adic counter-
part. The quantum jump in which qi-adic 3-surface is transformed to a real 3-surface is
impossible since one would obtain two identical real 3-surfaces lying on top of each other,
something very singular and not allowed by geometric exclusion principle for surfaces.
The pairs of boson and fermion surfaces would thus form cognitive representations stable
against intentional action.
ii) Physical states are created by products of super algebra generators. Bosonic generators
can have both real or p-adic partonic 3-surfaces as space-time correlates depending on
whether they correspond to intention or action.
More precisely, mB and nB code for
collections of real and p-adic partonic 3-surfaces. What remains to be interpreted is why
mB and nB cannot have common prime factors (this is possible if one allows also inﬁnite
integers obtained as products of ﬁnite integer and inﬁnite primes).
iii) Fermionic generators to the pairs of a real partonic 3-surface and its p-adic counterpart
obtained by algebraic continuation and the pictorial interpretation is as fermion hole pair.
Unrestricted quantum super-position of Boolean statements requires that many-fermion
state is accompanied by a corresponding many-antifermion state. This is achieved very
naturally if real and corresponding p-adic fermion have opposite fermion numbers so that
the kicking of negative energy fermion from Dirac sea could be interpreted as creation of
real-p-adic fermion pairs from vacuum.
If p-adic space-time sheets obey same algebraic expressions as real sheets (rational func-
tions with algebraic coeﬃcients), the Chern-Simons Noether charges associated with real
partons deﬁned as integrals can be assigned also with the corresponding p-adic partons
if they are rational or algebraic numbers. This would allow to circumvent the problems
related to the p-adic integration. Therefore one can consider also the possibility that p-
adic partons carry Noether charges opposite to those of corresponding real partons sheet
and that pairs of real and p-adic fermions can be created from vacuum. This makes sense
also for the classical charges associated with K¨ahler action in space-time interior if the real
space-time sheet obeying multi-p p-adic eﬀective topology has algebraic representation
allowing interpretation also as p-adic surface for all primes involved.
iv) This picture makes sense if the partonic 3-surfaces containing a state created by a
product of super algebra generators are unstable against decay to this kind of 3-surfaces so
that one could regard partonic 3-surfaces as a space-time representations for a conﬁguration
space spinor ﬁeld.
(d) Are alternative interpretations possible? For instance, could q = mB/nB code for the
eﬀective q-adic topology assignable to the space-time sheet. That q-adic numbers form a
ring but not a number ﬁeld casts however doubts on this interpretation as does also the
general physical picture.
Number theoretical universality of S-matrix
The discreteness of the intersection of the real space-time sheet and its p-adic variant obtained by
algebraic continuation would be a completely universal phenomenon associated with all fermionic

556
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
states. This suggests that also real-to-real S-matrix elements involve instead of an integral a sum
with the arguments of an n-point function running over all possible combinations of the points in
the intersection. S-matrix elements would have a universal form which does not depend on the
number ﬁeld at all and the algebraic continuation of the real S-matrix to its p-adic counterpart
would trivialize.
Note that also fermionic statistics favors strongly discretization unless one
allows Dirac delta functions.
10.7.4
Cognition, logic, and p-adicity
There seems to be a nice connection between logic aspects of cognition and p-adicity. In par-
ticular, p-valued logic for p = 2k −n has interpretation in terms of ordinary Boolean logic with
n ”taboos” so that p-valued logic does not conﬂict with common sense in this case. Also an
interpretation of projections of p-adic space-time sheets to an integer lattice of real Minkowski
space M 4 in terms of generalized Boolean functions emerges naturally so that M 4 projections
of p-adic space-time would represent Boolean functions for a logic with n taboos.
2-adic valued functions of 2-adic variable and Boolean functions
The binary coeﬃcients fnk in the 2-adic expansions of terms fnxn in the 2-adic Taylor expansion
f(x) = P
n=0 fnxn, assign a sequence of truth values to a 2-adic integer valued argument
x ∈{0, 1, ..., 2N} deﬁning a sequence of N bits. Hence f(x) assigns to each bit of this sequence
a sequence of truth values which are ordered in the sense that the truth values corresponding to
bits are not so important p-adically: much like higher decimals in decimal expansion. If a binary
cutoﬀin N:th bit of f(x) is introduced, BM-valued function in BN results, where B denotes
Boolean algebra fo 2 elements. The formal generalization to p-adic case is trivial: 2 possible
truth values are only replaced by p truth values representable as 0, ..., p −1.
p-Adic valued functions of p-adic variable as generalized Boolean functions
One can speak of a generalized Boolean function mapping ﬁnite sequences of p-valued Boolean
arguments to ﬁnite sequences of p-valued Boolean arguments. The restriction to a subset x =
kpn, k = 0, ..., p −1 and the replacement of the function f(x) with its lowest pinary digit gives
a generalized Boolean function of a single p-valued argument. If f(x) is invariant under the
scalings by powers of pk, one obtains a hologram like representation of the generalized Boolean
function with same function represented in inﬁnitely many length scales. This guarantees the
robustness of the representation.
The special role of 2-adicity explaining p-adic length scale hypothesis p ≃2k, k integer, in
terms of multi-p-acidic fractality would correlate with the special role of 2-valued logic in the
world order. The fact that all generalizations of 2-valued logic ultimately involve 2-adic logic at
the highest level, where the generalization is formulated would be analog of p-adic length scale
hypothesis.
p = 2k −n-adicity and Boolean functions with taboos
It is diﬃcult to assign any reasonable interpretation to p > 2-valued logic. Also the generalization
of logical connectives AND and OR is far from obvious. In the case p = 2k −n favored by the p-
adic length scale hypothesis situation is however diﬀerent. In this case one has interpretation in
terms Bk with n Boolean statements dropped out so that one obtains what might be called ˆ
Bk.
Since n is odd this set is not invariant under Boolean conjugation so that there is at least one
statement, which is identically true and could be called taboo, axiom, or dogma: depending on
taste. The allowed Boolean functions would be constructed in this case using standard Boolean
functions AND and OR with the constraint that taboos are respected: in other words, both the
inputs and values of functions belong to ˆ
Bk.
A unique manner to deﬁne the logic with taboos is to require that the number of taboos is
maximal so that if statement is dropped its negation remains in the logic. This implies n > Bk/2.

The projections of p-adic space-time sheets to real imbedding space as representa-
tions of of Boolean functions
Quantum classical correspondence suggests that generalized Boolean functions should have
space-time correlates. Since Boolean cognition involves free will, it should be possible to con-
struct space-time representations of arbitrary Boolean functions with ﬁnite number of arguments
freely. The non-determinism of p-adic diﬀerential equations guarantees this freedom.
p-Adic space-time sheets and p-adic non-determinism make possible to represent generalization
of Boolean functions of four Boolean variables obtained by replacing both argument and function
with p-valued pinary digit instead of bit. These representations result as discrete projections of
p-adic space-time sheets to integer valued points of real Minkowski space M 4. The interpretation
would be in terms of 4 sequences of truth values of p-valued logic associated with a ﬁnite 4-D
integer lattice whose lattice points can be identiﬁed as sequences of truth values of a p-valued
logic with a set of p-valued truth value at each point so that in the 2-adic case one has map
B4M →B4N. Here the number of lattice points in a given coordinate direction of M 4 is M
and N is the number of bits allowed by binary cutoﬀfor CP2 coordinates. For p = 2k −n
representing Boolean algebra with n taboos, the maps can be interpreted as maps ˆB4M →ˆB4N.
These lattices can be seen as subsets of rational shadows of p-adic space-time sheets to Minkowski
space. The condensed matter analog would be a lattice with a a sequence of p-valued dynamical
variables (sequence of bits/spins for p = 2) at each lattice point. At a ﬁxed spatial point of M 4
the lowest bits deﬁne a time evolution of a generalized Boolean function: B →B.
These observations support the view that intentionality and logic related cognition could perhaps
be regarded as 2-adic aspects of consciousness. The special role of primes p = 2k −n could also
be understood as special role of Boolean logic among p-valued logics and p = 2k −n logic would
correspond to Bk with n axioms representing logic respecting a belief system with n beliefs.
Recall that multi-p p-adic fractality involving 2-adic fractality is possible for the solutions of
ﬁeld equations and explains p-adic length scale hypothesis.
Most points of the p-adic space-time sheets correspond to real points which are literally inﬁnite as
real points. Therefore cognition would be in quite literal sense outside the real cosmos. Perhaps
this is a direct correlate for the basic experience that mind is looking the material world from
outside.
Connection with the theory of computational complexity?
There are interesting questions concerning the interpretation of four generalized Boolean argu-
ments. TGD explains the number D = 4 for space-time dimensions and also the dimension
of imbedding space. Could one also ﬁnd explanation why d = 4 deﬁnes special value for the
number of generalized Boolean inputs and outputs?
(a) Could the general theory of computational complexity allow to understand d = 4 as a
maximum number of inputs and outputs allowing the computation of something related
to these functions in polynomial time? For instance, complexity theorist could probably
immediately answer following questions. Could the computation of the 2-adic values of
CP2 coordinates as a function of 2-adic M 4 coordinates expressed in terms of fundamental
logical connectives take a time which is polynomial as a function of the number of N 4
pinary digits of M 4 coordinates and N 4 pinary digits of CP2 coordinates? Is this time
non-polynomial for M d and Sd, Sd d-dimensional internal space, d > 4. Unfortunately I
do not possess the needed complexity theoretic knowhow to answer these questions.
(b) The same question could make sense also for p > 2 if the notion of the logical connectives
and functions generalizes as it indeed does for p = 2k −n. Therefore the question would be
whether p-adic length scale hypothesis and dimensions of imbedding space and space-time
are implied by a polynomial computation time? This could be the case since essentially a
restriction of values and arguments of Boolean functions to a subset of Bk is in question.

Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
Some calculational details
In the following the details of p-adic non-determinism are described for a diﬀerential equation
of single p-adic variable and some comments about the generalization to the realistic case are
given.
1. One-dimensional case
To understand the essentials consider for simplicity a solution of a p-adic diﬀerential equation
giving function y = f(x) of one independent variable x = P
n≥n0 xnpn.
(a) p-Adic non-determinism means that the initial values f(x) of the solution can be ﬁxed
arbitrarily up to N +1:th pinary digit. In other words, f(xN), where xN = P
n0≤n≥N xnpn
is a rational obtained by dropping all pinary digits higher than N in x = P
n≥n0 xnpn can
be chosen arbitrarily.
(b) Consider the projection of f(x) to the set of rationals assumed to be common to reals and
p-adics.
i) Genuinely p-adic numbers have inﬁnite number of positive pinary digits in their non-
periodic expansion (non-periodicity guarantees non-rationality) and are strictly inﬁnite as
real numbers. In this regime p-adic diﬀerential equation ﬁxes completely the solution.
This is the case also at rational points q = m/n having inﬁnite number of pinary digits in
their pinary expansion.
ii) The projection of p-adic x-axis to real axis consists of rationals. The set in which solution
of p-adic diﬀerential equations is non-vanishing can be chosen rather freely. For instance,
p-adic ball of radius p−n consisting of points x = pMy, y ̸= 0, |y|p ≤1, can be considered.
Assume N > M. p-Adic nondeterminism implies that f(q) for q = P
M≤n≤N xnpn, can be
chosen arbitrarily. For M ≥0 q is always integer valued and the scaling of x by a suitable
power of p always allows to get a ﬁnite integer lattice at x-axis.
iii) The lowest pinary digit in the expansion of f(q) in powers of p in deﬁnes a pinary
digit. These pinary digits would deﬁne a representation for a sequence of truth values of
p-logic. p = 2 gives the ordinary Boolean logic. It is also interpret this pinary function as
a function of pinary argument giving Boolean function of one variable in 2-adic case.
2. Generalization to the space-time level
This picture generalizes to space-time level in a rather straight forward manner. y is replaced
with CP2 coordinates, x is replaced with M 4 coordinates, and diﬀerential equation with ﬁeld
equations deducible from the K¨ahler action. The essential point is that p-adic space-time sheets
have projection to real Minkowski space which consists of a discrete subset of integers when suit-
able scaling of M 4 coordinates is allowed. The restriction of 4 CP2 coordinates to a ﬁnite integer
lattice of M 4 deﬁnes 4 Boolean functions of four Boolean arguments or their generalizations for
p > 2. Also the modes of the induce spinor ﬁeld deﬁne a similar representation.
10.8
Updates since 2012
A considerable progress has occurred in the understanding of TGD inspired theory of conscious-
ness during the ﬁrst half of 2013. I have not however included separate sections about this
progress since other chapters of ”TGD Inspired theory of consciousness” already contain the
relevant material. A detailed representation of the recent vision about TGD inspired theory of
consciousness [K97] is recommended for the reader interested in details and various philosophical
problems and their solutions in TGD framework.
The basic vision has been that p-adic physics serves as correlate for cognitions and intentions and
that the quantum jumps between real and various p-adic realms are responsible for generating

10.8. Updates since 2012
559
thoughts and intentional actions. Also the idea that life resides in the rational intesrection of
realities and p-adicities has been the heuristic guideline during last years.
The basic new result is that
Cognition is one aspect of the reﬂective level of consciousness. The recent progress has led to the
understanding of reﬂective level of consciousness (see the end of ”Quantum Model of Memory”
[K66]). Reﬂective consciousness - as opposed to phenomenal consciousness represented by qualia
- can be modelled in terms of various representations - be they sensory, memory, or cognitive
ones - and their time reversals representing expectations, plans, and intentions [K97].
The
intuitive idea is that the representations should be approximate invariants under quantum jump
sequence. NMP [K44] indeed implies that negentropic entanglement is approximately invariant
under quantum jumps. This inspires the idea that various representations (sensory - , memory -
, cognitive - ) correspond to negentropically entangled systems - ”Akashic records”. Interaction
free quantum measurement allows non-destructive conscious reading of these representations in
arbitrarily good approximation.
Also the updated view about the realisation of representations is discussed at the end of the
chapter ”Quantum Model of Memory” [K66]. The basic assumption is that K¨ahler magnetic ﬂux
tubes carrying monopole ﬂux and topological light rays (”massless externals” (MEs)) parallel
to them serve as geometric correlates of quantum coherence and their braiding serves as corre-
late for negentropic entanglement. This leads to a rather concrete picture about how various
representations are realised at the level of the magnetic body of the organism.
The conscious reading of the representations by interaction free scattering of dark photons to-
gether with the assumption that biophotons result as dark photons transform to biophotons in
energy conserving manner leads to a direct contact with the experimental reality. The encourag-
ing ﬁnding made during the last years is that biophotons and EEG correlate with each other: the
reader interested in a detailed model can consult ”Are dark photons behind biophotons” [K95]
and ”Comments on the recent experiments by the group of Michael Persinger” [K96].
Imagination and internal speech as two fundamental aspects of cognition and there are strong in-
dications that right/left hemisphere prefers imagination/internal speech. Could one understand
this in TGD framework? Interaction free measurements relies on scattering of photons but it
is also possible to replace dark photons with dark phonons or even more general dark quanta.
If dark photons transform in energy conserving manner to ordinary photons interpreted as bio-
photons, then dark phonons should transform to biophonons. Second attractive idea is that
imagination/internal speech correspond to dark photons/dark photons used in interaction free
measurements and that right/left hemisphere has specialized to use dark photons/phonons. This
idea has several variants but there are indications that only right hemisphere emits biophotons.
This topic is discussed in detail in ”Are dark photons behind biophotons” [K95].
A basic question is what real-p-adic transitions mean and under what circumstances they are
possible. If one accepts the notion of ﬁnite measurement resolution and discretization as its
outcome, then the cognitive representations do not distinguish between real and p-adic topologies
and it is quite possible that real-p-adic transitions take place in all scales. Generalized Feynman
diagrams and number theoretical universality suggests a similar picture [K29]. A subsection
about this question is included.
Why vision and hearing are so fundamental for cognition?
The interaction free measurement is formulated in terms of photons. It can be however formu-
lated also for sound waves using phonon detectors and acoustic waves traversing through two
diﬀerent paths. Quantum coherence is required but the hierarchy of Planck constants makes
sense also for phonons by the basic equation E = hf.
In TGD framework there are good reasons to believe that sound waves are not only something
emerging at the level of condensed matter but correspond to oscillations of string like objects at
4-D space-time surface. These strings connect the wormhole contacts assignable to the light-like
orbits of partonic 2-surfaces. Partonic 2-surfaces can be assigned with elementary particles but
also to 2-surfaces with arbitrarily large size scale. The outer boundary of any physical object

560
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
would correspond to a partonic 2-surface. String world sheets carry fermion ﬁelds localized at
them (right-handed neutrino is an exception in that it is delocalized at entire space-time surface).
The fact that strings always connect two partonic 2-surfaces corresponds to the fundamental
two-particle character of sound waves. Sound would be as fundamental phenomenon as photons
and other massless bosons.
This encourages to ask whether photon (more generally gauge boson: TGD suggests that scaled
up copies of gluons and weak bosons behaving like massless particles even in cell length scale
are possible) and photon absorption could deﬁne fundamental conscious representations of infor-
mation realized in terms of interaction free measurements for negentropically entangled states
remaining unchanged under state function reduction in good approximation.
Photons would correspond to ”seeing” but at neuronal level rather than at the level of retina
- and imagination. Phonons would correspond to hearing at neuronal level and internal speech
which is also essential for cognition. Both internal speech and imagination could be understood
at fundamental aspects of cognition. Dark photons with energies of visible photons (decaying
to what is interpreted as biophotons) and dark phonons would be behind imagination and
internal speech. I have already earlier proposed that the lipid layers of neuronal membranes (and
maybe also ordinary cell membranes) can be regarded as pixels of a sensory map representing
neuronal qualia [K28]. These pixels could serve as the counterparts of the detectors C and D
appearing in interaction free measurement. The evidence for the importance of biophotons (in
TGD framework dark photons decay to biophotons in energy conserving manner) in biology and
neuroscience is emerging, see for instance the experiments of Persinger’s group [J58, J59, J60].
I have discussed these ﬁndings from TGD point of view in [K96].
One can speculate about direct translation between the words of language and visual pre-images.
In general I try to avoid reference to anything personal since but at this time I cannot resists
the temptaton to mention that during my ﬁrst ”great experience”, which served as a powerful
inspiration for TGD inspired theory of consciousness, I was able to see my thoughts and dis-
covered that this kind of correspondence seems to exists: I did experimentation with internal
speech by uttering words and immediately getting visual image to my visual ﬁeld as a response!
Biophotons seem to be associated only with the right hemisphere [J58]. This suggests that right
hemisphere or some parts of it prefer dark photons being thus specialized to visual imagination
in accordance with the fact that spatial relationships are the speciality of the right hemisphere.
Could this mean that left hemisphere or some parts of it prefer dark phonons (or dark photons in
IR range transforming [K96] to ordinary photons at ear and generating virtual auditory input?
Left hemisphere indeed is the verbal hemisphere specialized to linear linguistic cognition and
produces also internal speech.
10.8.1
Why one cannot do without p-adic physics?
It is diﬃcult to ﬁnd a completely convincing argument for why p-adic physics is necessary. As
a matter of fact, the same applies to real physics. All our computational activities use rationals
and one could argue that physics might allow a formulation using only rationals. It however is a
fact, that such formulations meet insurmountable diﬃculties with symmetries and are hopelessly
in-practical. The question is akin to the question whether music is only un-necessary mental
luxury and whether we could do without it. Every music lover knows that the life without music
would be life without transcendence and as such deadly boring.
My own general answer to the question is following. Certainly the contents of conscious ex-
perience can be characterized in terms of rational numbers (perhaps allowing also hierarchy
of algebraic extensions of rationals). The choice of coordinates used at the level of imbedding
space and space-time however varies continuously so that the description of all possible quantum
states requires real/complex number based physics. By p-adic variant of the general coordinate
invariance same applies at the p-adic side too.
In the following some more detailed arguments in favor of p-adic physics are discussed. Also the
question about the possibility of real-p-adic tarnsition is discussed. At the ﬁrst glance the idea
about a transition in which entire galaxy transforms to a thought about galaxy or vice versa looks

10.8. Updates since 2012
561
totally non-sensical. Maybe this the case but it turns out that just the discretization implied by
ﬁnite measurement resolution implies that sensory representations cannot distinguish between
real and p-adic sectors in the intersection of realities and p-adicities were life is assumed to
reside. Indeed, the view about generalised Feynman diagrams combined with number theoretical
universality suggests that the lines of the generalised Feymman diagrams [K29] can correspond
to reals or any p-adic number ﬁeld and that there are precise rules at vertices which number
ﬁelds can ”meet” at them.
Why p-adic physics?
One can invent several indirect arguments in favor of p-adics.
(a) Number theoretic entanglement entropy having negative values is absolutely essential for
negentropic entanglement and relies on p-adic norm. It would be somewhat strange to
use p-adic norm without bringing in the entire p-adic physics and generalizing physics
by postulating number theoretic universality bringing in powerful number theoretical con-
straints. p-Adic mass calculations provide a successful instance about the use of these
constraints [K48].
(b) One should understand the space-time correlates of cognition and intention. The postulate
that cognition and intentionality have p-adic space-time surfaces as geometric correlates
looks rather natural since the local ﬁeld equations remain true and p-adic non-determinism
implied by pseudo-constants can be identiﬁed as a correlate for the free will of thoughts
and intentions. If the notion of p-adic manifold is accepted, one ﬁnds a solution to various
problems plaguing the attempts to build a purely p-adic calculus. This notion leads to
the identiﬁcation of cognitive representations and their inverses as chart maps at space-
time level. Also the notion of ﬁnite measurement /cognitive resolution emerges from the
construction automatically.
Cognitive act corresponds to a quantum jump replacing real preferred extremal (space-time
surface) with a p-adic one in a given resolution so that real and p-adic space-time surface
have a discrete set of rational (or even algebraic) points in common. The transformation
of intention to action is the reversal of this (p-adic to real).
Intentions are thus time
reversals of cognitions. Hence the original ad hoc looking identiﬁcation of cognitive acts
and intentional acts as inverses of each other ﬁnds a justiﬁcation.
There are however several questions to be answered:
(a) Could cognition replace real space-time surface with a quantum superposition of p-adic
space-time surfaces having same discrete set of common points with real spae-time surface.
As one might expect, cognition would perform abstraction by regarding all p-adic space-
time surfaces with same discrete backbone as equivalent.
(b) Is the amplitude of all p-adic space-time surfaces in the quantum superposition same?
The notion of ﬁnite measurement resolution requires this and this is very probably force
already by purely mathematical constraints.
(c) What about intention: is it reversal of abstraction? Does it assign to a superposition p-adic
space-time surfaces single real space-time surface? Motor action is indeed specialization:
from general plan to a detailed motor action. This proposal as such is too strong.
The notion of p-adic manifold and cognitive map as a chart map
Finite resolution (measurement/sensory/cognitive) is fundamental for quantum TGD and the
notion of p-adic manifold [K98] forces it.
The basic question is how to construct p-adic variant for manifold.
Manifold - say Earth’s
surface - is characterized by a collection of maps for various regions. The sheets of the map have
overlap. Chart map maps part of Earth’s surface to a page of map.

562
Chapter 10. p-Adic Physics as Physics of Cognition and Intention
The idea generalizes to cogntiive maps and intentions to action as inverse of cognition. For
p-adic manifolds the map sheets are however not p-adic but real!
One must also assume a
ﬁnite resolution for purely mathematical reasons. Only discrete set of p-adic points of p-adic
space-time surface- one might call them land marks - are mapped to real points and these points
are rational in the simplest situation (algebraic in more general case). The maps obtained are
characterized by the resolution of the discretization. Lengt resolution (p-adic length scale) and
angle resolution.
Field equations for preferred extremal allow to continue the discrete map image to a continuous
real space-time surface. This need not be unique and quantum superposition of all preferred
extremals with same discretization would deﬁne ”quantum map”. The map from p-adic to real
side would realied intentional action.
Same applies in reverse direction: now one obtains cognitive representation as a p-adic map of
real space-time surface.
What real ↔p-adic transitions can occur?
In ZEO in principle real-to-padic transition could occur for any zero energy state. Conservation
of quantum numbers does not pose any constraints.
Objection: entire galaxy cannot deﬁnitely transform to pure thought!
At ﬁrst glance this would be in dramatic conﬂict with common sense for anyone accustomed to
real number based reality. Could matter really transform to thought or vice versa? Could entire
galaxy transform to pure thought or vice versa?!
At second glance one asks what we really know about matter and thought and does anything
happen for what we known it in the rea–p-adic transitions. Finite measurement resolution is the
key notion and emerges directly from an attempt to deﬁned the notion of p-adic manifold. Finite
resolution is fundamental to physics and cognition and we know that mathematical thought in
practices alwasy requires discretization and rational numbers.
Conscious information is only about discrete point set of partonic two surfaces (holography):
rational and perhaps also some algebraic points. These points are common to real and p-adic
space-time surfaces and deﬁne cognitive representations. They are not changed in the real-to-
padic quantum jump! This discretization is in the intersection of matter and thought.
Objection: Why real-to-padic transformation would be needed at all? Cannot we do quite well
without it and p-adics altogegher?
(a) The ﬁrst defense for the p-adic level is that p-adic mass caculations work too well. Mathe-
matician would talk about importance of having number theoretical universality of physics.
(b) Above I already represented some arguments in favor of p-adic physics.
(c) One can also start from conscious experience. p-Adic topology is natural if one tries to
identify correlates of conscious thought. One defense relates to the measurement/cognitive
resolution which we know is fundamental aspect of consciousness so that one must un-
derstand it.
One aspect of abstraction process is throwing details away and could be
understood as introduction of poorer resolution. There must be a quantum mechanism
consisting of quantum jumps realizing abstraction of its inverse. In sensory perception
one builds abstraction after abstraction. In motor action process goes in reverse direction:
from a sketchy plan to detailed realization.
The resolution and discretization is naturally associated with cognitive maps from reals
to p-adics and their reversals. In purely real context one does not obtain the resolution in
any natural manner.

How to change resolution to achieve change of abstraction level?
A model for how to change resolution could be as follows. Let us consider a real quantum state
characterized by some resolution so that it is superposition of preferred extremals with common
discretization. How to change this resolution: that is common discretization?
It seems impossible to directly change the resolution say at real side: one cannot deﬁne transition
amplitude between superpositions of real surfaces in diﬀerent resolutions since the discretizations
have no common points which would carry the data appearing in transition amplitude.
The cautious proposal is that the following 2-step procedure real→p-adic→real procedure achieves
the change of resolution for real quantum states. The idea is that for real preferred extremals
and their p-adic counterparts it is possible to talk about common set of discrete points.
(a) Real quantum state in given resolution is replaced with its p-adic counterpart in new
resolution. This seems to be a well-deﬁned procedure since for each preferred extremal in
superposition it is possible to identify the common points.
(b) Replace this p-adic superposition with superposition real preferred extremals in this new
resolution.
Objection: why not use only the rational points common to reals and p-adics and give up the
notion of continuum altogether.
Defense: resolution would be ﬁxed once and for all. Abstraction would not be a well-deﬁned
concept. The presence of real and p-adic continua is quite essential for the dynamics of con-
sciousness.

The violent encounters with skeptics have demonstrated to me that surprisingly many skeptics

position in the scientiﬁc community; because I have not published my work in respectable
journals; etc..., and it is very diﬃcult to dig even a single bit of information relating somehow
to the actual contents of my work. Regrettably this seems to be the case for most of arguments
used by those who appear publicly as skeptics. Needless to say, skepticism in this sense has
nothing to do with skepticism in the real sense of the word. Just the opposite, these ’skeptics’
identify themselves as the mind police of the dominating materialistic-reductionistic science and
see as their holy goal the identiﬁcation and ridiculization of the scientiﬁc dissidents as pseudo
scientists. For instance, I have been blamed for super-naturalism because I have been forced to
introduce the notion of quantum jump between quantum histories forcing in turn to give up the
notion of observer independent objective reality. The attempts to defend this vision by telling
that this is the only possible logically consistent view about quantum jump forced by General
Coordinate Invariance alone and solving the basic paradoxes of modern physics have been waste
of time.
There are of course notable exceptions to this rule of thumb: Susan Blackmore represents an
example of an intellectually honest skeptic who respects also the diﬀerent world views and takes
materialistic dogma only one possible view about world which must be also subjected to testing.
The basic objection against paranormal phenomena by skeptic researchers such as Susan Black-
more, is that there is no theory of paranormal phenomena making possible meaningful experi-
mental tests so that the minimal working hypothesis is that these phenomena do not exist. The
absence of a theory certainly makes experimental approach extremely diﬃcult: a good analogy
of the situation is provided by the high energy elementary particle physics where the enormous
amount of data and noise makes possible only the detection of signatures predicted by various
theories by comparing highly detailed Monte Carlo simulations of model world with the data.
Personally I however see this attitude as counter productive: I agree with someone who said that
the worst form of ignorance is to regard un-explainable as a synonym of impossible. I ﬁnd it also
very entertaining to play ’what if this is true’ games with thoughts rather than adopting the
somewhat boring role of a serious scientist. These thought games also often lead to ideas which
need not be even related to the original question. I however hasten to admit that my attitude
does not derive from a mere open-mindedness and mere desire to play thought games but from
the simple facts of life: TGD indeed provides a conceptual framework in which paranormal
567

Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
phenomena might be understood and studied; secondly, as an eternally unemployed scientiﬁc
dissident I really do not have anything to lose anymore.
11.1.1
What one means with paranormal?
According to Wikipedia deﬁnition [J17] paranormal is a general term that designates experiences
that lie outside ”the range of normal experience or scientiﬁc explanation”, or which indicates
phenomena understood to be outside of science’s current ability to explain or measure. Nothing
wrong with this but the text continues: ”Paranormal phenomena are distinct from certain
hypothetical entities, such as dark matter and dark energy, insofar as paranormal phenomena
are inconsistent with the world as already understood through empirical observation coupled
with scientiﬁc methodology”.
The latter sentence contains two intellectually inhonest claims typical for skeptics. First of all,
contary to the claim dark matter and energy are far from being understood within the recent
main stream view about physics and very many theoreticians question their existence. Secondly,
paranormal phenomena are just something that we do not understand just like dark matter
and energy rather than ”being inconsistent with empirical observation coupled with scientiﬁc
methology”. The irony is that in TGD Universe the scientiﬁc explanation for dark matter and
dark energy supports also the reality of various paranormal phenomena.
The article continues by creating the impression that people taking seriously paranormal phe-
nomena are blind believers and puts the main emphasis on ghosts, haunts, and other spiritual
entities and gives only a minor emphasis on phenomena studied systematically in laboratory.
To add irony: TGD inspired theory of consciousness predicts an inﬁnite self hierarchy and dark
matter is in an essential role in making this hierarchy possible. Depending on one’s tastes one
can call these higher level entities higher level selves or angels but the possible existence of these
entities as such is in no manner inconsistent with the scientiﬁc methology.
To make clear my own position: I am anomalistic in the sense that I do not either believe or not-
believe. I am just ready to accept also observations which do not conform with the expectation
of science as it is ﬁve centuries after Newton and try to understand them in a wider conceptual
framework rather than trying to ridiculize anomalies by mis-using formal scientiﬁc authority.
11.1.2
Development of ideas about paranormal
During years I have developed several ideas about paranormal phenomena and, believing that
there must be very few general principles behind these phenomena, I try to combine these ideas
into a single coherent conceptual framework in this chapter. For the convenience of the reader
it is good to summarize the evolution of the basic concepts brieﬂy.
(a) On the experimental side the most important boosts came from the lecture of Cyril Smith
about homeopathy in CASYS’2001 conference [I35] and from the contact with Lian Sidoroﬀ
and from reading her articles related to remote vision and healing [J120] . Also the work
of Gariaev’s group on wave aspects of DNA [I16] was important for the concretization of
the ideas. Of course, without the already existing view about living matter as symbiosis
of MEs, of superconducting magnetic ﬂux tubes, and of ordinary biomatter at atomic
space-times sheets- a view that was inspired the information about eﬀects of ELF em
ﬁelds on brain [J44] and by the strange ﬁndings challenging the notions of ionic pumps
and channels [I31] - these developments would not have been possible.
(b) On the theoretical side the realization that p-adic physics provides the physics of cognition
and intention was a decive breakthrough. The realization that number theoretic variant
of Shannon entropy can be negative led to the idea of number theoretic entanglement
negentropy but it took years to realize the profound implications of the notion, which can
be summarized by the statement that living matter is a number theoretically quantum
critical phase residing in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.

11.1. Introduction
569
(c) The lectures of Peter Marcer about quantum holographic brain provided an important
stimulus leading to the realization that MEs (massless extremals) serve among other things
also as quantum holograms.
The ideas about magnetic mirrors (ME-parallel magnetic
ﬂux tube pairs) acting as electromagnetic bridges between living subsystems and about
liquid crystal blobs representing and amplifying the rotational, vibrational, etc. spectra of
molecules, are the most recent newcomers in the zoo of ideas.
(d) The resulting concrete view is that living organisms at all levels of the hierarchy are
connected by the magnetic mirrors serving as electromagnetic bridges between them and
making possible high precision directed communication, remote sensing, sensory represen-
tations using magnetic sensory canvas, memory as communication betweeen the geometric
past and geometric now, and remote control. Even the claimed communications with de-
ceased can be seen as being based on the same mechanism as long term memory. Besides
classical signalling with light velocity quantum entanglement (also timelike) mediated by
MEs is key element of model and makes possible sharing of experiences. By fractality the
same basic mechanisms are at work in all length scales: water memory and our long term
memory are the same phenomenon but in diﬀerent length scales. Similarly, the miracu-
lous molecular recognition mechanisms and remote healing and vision are also phenomena
based on the same basic mechanisms.
(e) A further strong support for the idea that biosphere is a fractal organic whole came from
the realization that the notion of psychological time leads to paradoxes unless one assumes
that psychological time corresponds to the space-time region at which macroscopic volition
is concentrated: this front of volition proceeding in the direction of future is where the p-
adic-to-real phase transition changing intention to macroscopic action dominantly occurs.
The original detailed realization of this view is in conﬂict with the recent view inspired
by zero energy ontology and the notion of causal diamond (CD) and suggesting that the
arrow of psychological time at space-time level and the localization of sensory experience
in a narrow time interval is an outcome of intentional action and could be understood via a
generalization of Negentropy Maximization Principle implying that selves can be regarded
as curious entities [K3] .
11.1.3
Topics to be discussed
The ﬂow diagram for this chapter looks like following.
(a) I propose a general vision about the mechanisms behind the paranormal phenomena based
on the ideas brieﬂy summarized. This involves the new view about psychological time,
p-adic physics as the physics of cognition and intention, the notion of negentropic entan-
glement, the notion of magnetic mirrors, LC crystal water blobs as mimicking electromag-
netically molecules and amplifying signals em signals, ﬁeld representation of the genetic
information based on magnetic mirrors, a general model for remote mental interactions,
and the proposal that stochastic resonance serves a universal ampliﬁcation mechanism.
(b) Some paranormal phenomena in biological length scales are considered.
A model for
healing by time reversal is formulated and Priore’s machine is discussed in this framework
with an attempt to understand the situation quantitatively. Also a model the delaWarr
camera are discussed is proposed.
(c) Parapsychological phenomena like extrasensory perception, precognition, psychokinesis,
near-death experiences, and communications between living and dead are discussed: re-
mote healing and vision are discussed also in [K32] .
(d) A TGD based model for the instrumental transcommunication (ITC), in particular elec-
tronic voice phenomena (EVP), is developed in more detail (I am grateful for Adrian Klein
for informing me about these phenomena).
(e) Adaptive robots of Mark Tilden behave very much like living creatures and the possibility
that this might actually be the case is considered.

570
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
I want to emphasize again to the blood-thirsty skeptics that I am not believer nor non-believer.
These phenomena, be they actual or not, are extremely stimulating for a theorist with a trait
to creative thinking and have helped me to understand what in the TGD universe is new and
impossible in the reductionistic and materialistic universe of the skeptic. Certainly the ability to
explain these not-ﬁnally established phenomena does not make TGD pseudo science. In the same
way, the ability of TGD based vision to say something nontrivial about religious experience and
consciousness after the physical death does not mean that TGD replaces scientiﬁc explanation
with a religious dogma (also this point I have been forced to explain again and again to some of
my very skeptic friends).

11.2.1
The notion of magnetic mirror
Magnetic ﬂux tubes and MEs are basic structures in TGD based model of biosystems based
on the symbiosis of MEs, magnetic ﬂux tubes and ordinary biomatter at atomic space-time
sheets. Magnetic ﬂux tubes are topological ﬁeld quanta of magnetic ﬁeld whereas MEs (’massless
extremals’) are topological ﬁeld quanta of radiation ﬁeld, ’light rays’.
Magnetic mirrors formed by the magnetic ﬂux tube-ME pairs occur in many diﬀerent contexts in
TGD inspired theory of consciousness. For example, magnetic mirrors of length of order lightlife
appear in the model of long term memory. Classically: when I (whose correlate is magnetic
body) look at suﬃciently distant mirror I see the me of the geometric past as it is represented
by the mental images created by brain. Quantum mechanically: timelike quantum entanglement
made possible by the magnetic mirror makes it possible for the self of the geometric now to share
the experience of the subself of the geometric past. Magnetic mirrors can be said to deﬁne a
fundamental model for sensory-motor loop.
Magnetic mirrors are crucial for the model of the sensory canvas [K37] and there seems to be
no sharp diﬀerence between diﬀerent types of memory which suggests that there is an entire

11.2. General view about paranormal phenomena
571
hierarchy of memories in various p-adic time scales. Magnetic mirrors play a key role in the
model of frequency imprinting and provide a general molecular recognition mechanism. Magnetic
mirrors allow also a generalization of manysheeted DNA so that magnetic mirrors represent
genetic information in electromagnetic form [K32] .
In accordance with the fractality of consciousness, the wide applicability of the magnetic mirror
notion suggests that various functions associated with the magnetic mirrors are diﬀerent aspects
of the same basic phenomenon. Magnetic mirrors would thus provide sensory canvases, long
term memory mirrors and recognition mechanism at all length scales. Even manysheeted DNA
would possess sensory canvas and long term memories, perhaps an entire hierarchy of them.
Taken the ideas of fractality and quantum hologram to extreme, one can even consider the
possibility that our long term memories are average of those associated with genes associated
with various neurons! Nothing precludes the possibility that magnetic mirrors can also serve
as electromagnetic bridges between diﬀerent organisms (even the notion of organism must be
generalized if the idea of multibrained magnetic selves is taken seriously). This could make
possible eﬀects similar to observed at DNA level (such as self assembly and translation of RNA
to proteins made possible by electromagnetic recognition mechanism based on em bridges).
The latest application of the notion of magnetic mirror is to TGD inspired biology [K62] .
Magnetic mirrors in this case appear as pairs of ﬂux sheets assignable to the strands of DNA. The
ﬂux tube sheet going through the passive strand mediates sensory information coming from cell
and nuclear membranes via magnetic ﬂux tubes to various levels of the magnetic body whereas
the ﬂux tube going through the active strand mediates control commands of the magnetic body
initiating gene expression with transcription being only one particular kind of gene expression.
The intronic parts of DNA are assumed to be involved with topological quantum computation
type activities in this model [K23] . One can say that DNA double strand takes the role of
brain of cell and the passive and active sections of strands are analogous to sensory and motor
areas of brain hemispheres. Also the analog of lateralization of brain functions is suggested to
take place at the level of DNA and reﬂect itself in the character of gene expressions of the two
strands (both strands contain sections expressed also in standard sense).
The hierarchy of Planck constants is essential element of the model and leads to a generalization
of the notion of genome: magnetic ﬂux sheets integrate sequences of genomes to larger super
genome involving genomes of several cells and these in turn can integrate in longer hypergenomes.
This could give rise to a collective gene expressions at the level of organelle, organ, organism,
and even population. In the case of remote mental interactions applied to living target this
model deﬁnes a natural starting point since all tools for remote sensory perception and motor
action are available in standard form. Also the existence of collective gene expression would
bring in new insights: for instance, the notion of species memory proposed by Sheldrake could
be realized in this framework.
11.2.2
Summary of the model
The general quantum model for bio-systems leads to a model for bio-control which applies to
a very wide variety of hard-to-understand bio-chemical phenomena such as molecular recogni-
tion mechanisms, water memory, and homeopathy and leads to a generalization of genetic code
explaining the mystery of introns. The same model generalizes to a model of paranormal phe-
nomena such as psychokinesis, remote sensing, remote healing, telepathy, communications with
deceased, and instrumental transcommunications. The basic diﬀerence is that magnetic body
receives information and controls ”foreign” biological (or even magnetic) body or ”dead” matter
system.
Key ideas
(a) The basic notions of the model are magnetic body as an intentional agent controlling
biological body and receiving data from living body or even ”dead” matter system with
massless extremals (MEs) mediating these communications, zero energy ontology and the
related notion of causal diamond (CD) serving as an imbedding space correlate of self and

572
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
assigning to elementary particles fundamental macroscopic time and length scales as those
of CD, the hierarchy of Planck constants making possible macroscopic quantum phases and
zoom-ups of quantum systems, and the vision about living matter as something residing
in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and the closely related notion of negentropic
entanglement crucial for the functioning of living matter and conscious intelligence in
TGD Universe. Note that this means that life corresponds to number theoretical quantum
criticality in a well-deﬁned sense.
(b) Zero energy ontology means a radical departure from standard physics.
The creation
of zero energy states from vacuum is possible and means that in principle the claims of
parapsychologists about ectoplasm and of yogis about the possibility to create of matter
from nothing are consistent with the basic conservation laws of physics. In TGD inspired
biology this process could take place routinely. Causal diamond is the imbedding space
correlate for the zero energy state. Positive and negative energy parts of the state reside
at its boundaries. p-Adic length scale hypothesis and number theoretical vision suggest
that the proper time distance between the tips of CD comes as powers of two. For electron
and quarks playing key role in the model of DNA as topological quantum computer this
temporal distance would correspond .1 seconds and 1 millisecond respectively suggesting
a direct connection between elementary particle physics and basic bio-rhythms.
The translates and Lorentz transforms of CDs are also CDs and one can assign to CDs a
moduli space further expanded by the introduction of the hierarchy of Planck constants.
One expects that this moduli space is crucial for understanding of the geometric qualia
[K64] . The communications between subselves would be naturall based on resonance.
CDs are characterized by resonance frequencies which in the rest system of CD come as
harmonics of the fundamental frequency determined by the proper time distance. This
would allow a universal coding of geometric data using frequencies. Both MEs and CDs
could be regarded as being analogous to music instruments and this in fact explains basic
facts about music experience. These resonance frequencies should play a key role in biology
and also in remote mental interactions- even those in which target consists of ”dead” matter
since fundamental biorhythms characterize also elementary particlesin TGD Universe.
(c) p-Adic physics as physics of cognition and intentionality is an essential element of approach.
Intentions are represented as p-adic space-time sheets. In the intersection of real and p-
adic worlds these space-time sheets have a mathematical representation making sense also
in real context so that one can say that these surfaces are in the intersection of real
and p-adic worlds and the phase transitions transforming surfaces belonging to diﬀerent
number ﬁelds are possible. This makes possible transformation of intentions to actions
and their reversals possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds. U-matrix indeed
makes indeed sense also for transformation representing the transformation of say p-adic
space-time surface to a real one and is coded only by data assignable to the rational and
common algebraic points of real and p-adic variants of partonic 2-surface [K44] . Note
that zero energy ontology makes possible also the transformation of intentions to actions
as p-adic-to-real phase transitions without breaking of the conservation laws.
(d) Negentropic entanglement, which can be both space-like and time-like in zero energy on-
tology, makes possible quantum superposition of macroscopically diﬀerent conﬁgurations
of the target system correlated with the states of operator system. The operator should
be able to achieve the negentropic entanglement and intentionally increase the amplitude
of the desired outcome in this superposition. Negentropic entanglement need not involve
binding energy and I have proposed this as a deeper level explanation for the nebulous
notion of high energy phosphate bond crucial for metabolism in living matter. Quite gener-
ally, negentropic entanglement would make possible for the operator to transfer metabolic
energy and momentum to the target. The hierarchy of values of Planck constant would
make possible this process in long time and length scales.
A more concrete model
The following would represent the concrete model what happens in remote mental interaction.

11.2. General view about paranormal phenomena
573
(a) Magnetic mirrors (ME-magnetic ﬂux tube pairs) connecting the sender and receiver make
possible a universal mechanism for the transfer of intent and action. The pair of ﬂux tubes
forms a kind of sensory-motor loop. In biology the fundamental realization could be by a
pair of ﬂux sheets going through the strands of DNA with passive strand sending sensory
data to the magnetic body and active strand receiving control commands leading to various
forms of gene expresion. MEs are ideal for the transfer of both classical information and
momentum.
(b) p-Adic MEs represent the intention and real MEs represent the action. p-Adic ME can be
transformed to real ME either by receiver or some higher level magnetic self. This makes
sense only in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds.Also smaller MEs can be send along
the MEs serving as bridges (this is like throwing balls with light velocity!). In this case
one can speak about transfer of intent and of action.
(c) The realization of intention via p-adic-to-real phase transition gives rise to mechanism
of remote interaction which can act both endo- and exogenously. Magnetic mirrors as
characterized by their fundamental frequencies make possible bridges between sender and
receiver (say healer and healee) and allow a resonant interaction in which healer can initiate
various control commands acting as 4-dimensional templates represented as holograms.
Also CDs are characterized by fundamental frequencies and MEs and CDs must be in
resonance. This makes very strong predictions about resonance bands due to the possibility
of Lorentz transforms of CDs. For non-relativistic boosts for CDs the bands have however
width of order ∆f/f ∼v/c and are therefore very narrow.
(d) The ME-magnetic ﬂux tube pair connecting sender and receiver can can initiate an arbi-
trarily complex hologram representing biological program if the wave pattern assignable
to ME interferes with a reference wave associated with the receiver. Sender has the ability
to generate and amplify the frequencies which induce holograms representing the control
commands. In particular, in living matter sender can initiate complex biological programs
without knowing anything about their functioning and the challenge of the operator is to
learn these control commands. The situation resembles that encountered in neuro feed-
back.
Remote mental interactions with living resp. ”dead” matter
One can distinguish between psychokinesis applied to living matter and ”dead” matter.
(a) When the target consists of living matter the mechanisms would be same as in communi-
cations between magnetic and biological bodies making possible bio-control of biological
body by magnetic body and the receival of sensory input from biological body by magnetic
body. Hypnosis would be one example of this kind of interaction.
(b) Remote mental interactions in the case ”dead” could use simpler variants of the fundamen-
tal mechanisms utilized in living matter. For instance, zero energy ontology assigns with
the CDs of electron and quarks time scales .1 s and 1 ms deﬁning fundamental biorhythms.
The CDs assignable to elementary particles could be involved also with psychokinesis. Ne-
gentropic entanglement could be essential for the transfer of metabolic energy (say in
simple psychokinesis moving an object) and for control actions -say in intentional change
of sequences of binary digits produced by random number generator. Target system would
not be completely ”dead”.
Thermodynamical restrictions favor large values of Planck
constant.
Who knows how?
The basic problem in many remote mental interactions such as the intentional eﬀect on random
number generator is ”Who knows how?”. How the mere intent can be transformed to action
without any knowledge about the details of the action? The attempt to understand how neuro-
feedback aﬀect the behavior of single neuron leads to the same question.

574
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
(a) Magnetic mirrors make possible also feedback and this feedback could make possible learn-
ing. For instance, in psychokinesis (especially so in micro PK), this learning would be
crucial and analogous to that what occurs when we learn to drive a car. In healing this
kind of feedback might help to ﬁnd the healing frequency by trial and error.
(b) It is quite possible that also multibrained and -bodied higher level colletive selves actively
participate in the process as a third party such that the remote mental interactions would
act as a relay states. I have suggested similar explanation for Sheldrake’s ﬁndings about
learning at the lelel of species and Tiller’s ﬁndings about the ”transfer of intent”. This
could make possible coherent ampliﬁcation eﬀects (TEM, prayer groups) and could make
available information resources of all brains involved with the group. This could for in-
stance explain the ability of a remote viewer to see an object on basis of data which need
not have any meaning for her.
(c) A fast amplitude modulation of alpha waves introducing higher harmonics to the carrier
wave is a good candidate for mediating communication between brains and higher level
multibrained selves. Mesoscopic ’features’ in brain involve precisely this kind of amplitude
modulation and might represent just this kind of messages.
Interestingly, also speech
is produced by a fast amplitude modulation of 10 Hz basic vibration frequency of speech
organs (assignable to electron CD as a fundamental frequency) and kHz (quarks) frequency
is a special frequency from the point of view of hearing.
Why paranormal phenomena are so rare?
The model should be also able to explain why it is so diﬃcult to show that paranormal phe-
nomena are real.
(a) The very fact that experimenters usually do their best to eliminate subjective elements
from the experimental arrangements might explain why paranormal phenomena are so
poorly reproducible.
(b) Field bodies apply naturally to personal biological body basic mechanisms of remote mental
interactions and the evolution of a kind of immune system preventing the access of foreign
ﬁeld bodies to personal biological body looks very natural.
(c) The basic prediction of zero energy ontology is breaking of second law of thermodynamics
in the time scale of CD considered. In suﬃciently long scale averaging however destroys the
anomaly and statistical argument can be also used to support the claim that the breaking
was only a statistical ﬂuctuations. Zero energy states are indeed counterparts of vacuum
ﬂuctuations in standard physics. It is also quite possible that in the statistical averaging
these phenomena indeed disappear and it might be more reasonable to concentrate on the
character of the ﬂuctuations around the average. An interesting analogy is the research
of Shnoll related to the ﬂuctuations of radioactive and chemical rates which demonstrated
clear periodicities in ﬂuctuations correlating with astrophysical periods [E2] , [E2] . Per-
haps this approach might be applied also to the claimed paranormal phenomena.
This model explains a wide variety of observations related to remote healing and vision [J120]
: these observations are discussed in [K32] . Since magnetic mirrors can connect also living
organisms and ’dead’ mater, say electronic instruments, the model can be applied to explain
also phenomena like micropsychokinesis, causal anomalies related to machine-animal interaction,
and so called instrumental transcommunications.
11.3
Paranormal phenomena in biological systems
In this section a TGD inspired model for healing based on time reversal bringing the system back
to the healthy state is proposed. Priore’s machine is discussed as an application of the model.
Also the weird sounding claims about delaWarr camera are discussed in the general conceptual
framework.

11.3. Paranormal phenomena in biological systems
575
11.3.1
Healing by time reversal
The article of Lian Sidorov [J120] and its references give a thorough view about remote healing
and viewing. One particular healing method goes under name Qigong (see the article [J43] ).
Qigong is a general term for a large variety of traditional Chinese energy exercises and therapies.
Qigong is generally considered as a self-training method or process through Qi (vital energy)
and Yi (consciousness or intention) cultivation to achieve the optimal state of both body and
mind. The traditional Chinese medicine postulates the existence of Qi, which could be regarded
as a kind of subtle energy circulating around the physical body.
Zero energy ontology in principle makes possible the creation of matter from vacuum as zero
energy states. This process involves a generation of a new CD serving as a correlate for self
carrying positive and negative energy parts of the zero energy state at its future and past
boundaries. The standard physics interpretation would be as a quantum ﬂuctuation in a space-
time volume dictated by CD. At space-time level space-time sheets within CD would be the
correlate. Also the transformation of p-adic space-time sheets to real ones and vice versa in the
intersection of real and p-adic worlds becomes possible.
Massless extremals are excellent candidates for the space-time correlates of communication and
control signals and depending on the sign of the energy can propagate in both time directions.
Real bosons correspond to wormhole contacts connecting positive (negative) energy MEs whereas
virtual bosons are identiﬁed the wormhole contacts connecting positive and negative energy MEs.
In zero energy ontology it makes sense to speak about quantum jumps transforming p-adic MEs
to real ones and about reﬂection of MEs in time direction so that positive energy ME transforms
to negative energy ME or vice versa. Also MEs analogous to virtual particles are possible. They
correspond to pairs of MEs with opposite time orientations so that the wormhole throats carry
opposite signs of energy. In this case the classical momentum is not anymore light-like and
although wormhole throats are massless the boson itself can be interpreted as a virtual oﬀ-mass-
shell particle.
In quantum optics time reversal is known as a phase conjugation [D7] and is one of the basic
notions of holography. MEs act as both quantum holograms and receiving and sending quantum
antennae [K55] . MEs can generate reference waves of coherent photons interacting with other
MEs and activating dynamical holograms of coherent light.
If the reference wave is phase
conjugated, the resulting hologram is time reversed.
What makes this so interesting is that MEs and magnetic ﬂux tuves are the tools of of quantum
control in the TGD based view about biosystem as a symbiosis in which MEs control super-
conducting magnetic ﬂux tubes controlling ordinary matter at atomic space-time sheets via the
many-sheeted ionic ﬂow equilibrium. The coherent light pattern emitted by ME resulting from
the interaction of ME with the reference wave (its phase conjugate) could act as a control com-
mand (time reversed control command) inducing process (time reversed process). Conjugate
reference waves would thus provide an incredibly simple and general mechanism of healing by
time reversal allowing the living matter to ﬁght against second law. This would be like a general
initiating a war by just nodding or shaking his head.
What time reversal for biological programs could mean?
Of course, one can ask what one precisely means when one says that biological program runs
backwards.
(a) In zero energy ontology the most natural interpretation would be that the arrow of geo-
metric becomes non-standard for some sub-CDs of the CD deﬁning the standard arrow.
Time reversal would take place always in some time scale. In the case of healing the rever-
sal would be induced for the population of sub-CDs to be healed. The healing mechanism
would require only the reversal of the arrow of time. The details of the biological programs
would not matter.
(b) The time scales of sub-CDs in question would correspond to the time scales of the biological
functions in question and the time scale would be proportional to the value of Planck

576
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
constant involved. There is direct experimental evidence [D11] that the time direction
assigned to the second law changes in time scale of .1 seconds deﬁning the time scale of
electronic CD: this is discussed in detail in [K44] . Miraculous healings in which healing
occurs instantaneously could be understood if this interpretation is correct.
The basic question is how to induce the time reversal in a given time scale and here one can make
even guesses. The argument for the arrow of geometric time [K3] is based on the generalization of
NMP [K44] : subselves are curious about what is outside CD and tend to concentrate near either
light-like boundary of CD and to induce quantum jumps shifting the quantum superpositions of
space-time sheet backwards in geometric time of space-time sheet so that the stationary subself
is like a stationary object in ﬂowing river and experiences an apparent time ﬂow.
Perhaps
a powerful enough time reversed signal from the past boundary of CD could stimulate the
curiousity of of sub-selves and induce the migration or creation of the subself-population to the
past boundary. Maybe phase conjugage coherent radiation could deﬁne this signal.
Qigong from TGD point of view
The article of Lian Sidorov [J120] and its references give a thorough view about remote healing
and viewing. One particular healing method goes under name Qigong (see the article [J43] ).
Qigong is a general term for a large variety of traditional Chinese energy exercises and therapies.
Qigong is generally considered as a self-training method or process through Qi (vital energy)
and Yi (consciousness or intention) cultivation to achieve the optimal state of both body and
mind. The traditional Chinese medicine postulates the existence of Qi, which could be regarded
as a kind of subtle energy circulating around the physical body.
In TGD framework the energy associated with MEs and supracurrents ﬂowing along magnetic
circuitry could be a natural counterpart of Qi. The positive metabolic energy assignable to
negentropic entanglement or negentropic entanglement could be an alternative identiﬁcation for
Qi. If entanglement is entropic it corresponds to bound state entanglement and this entanglement
of its negative metabolic energy could be seen as the counterpart of ”sick Qi”.
Yi could in turn would translate to p-adic cognitive representations representing also intentions,
perhaps p-adic variants of MEs or even magnetic mirrors. Internal Qigong refers to self healing
whereas external Qigong means directing Qi energy or intention to help others by opening
Qi blockages or inducing the sick Qi to get out of body, or helping to achieve Qi balance.
The transfer of metabolic energy by ATP-ADP process [K26] would be basically a transfer of
negentropic entanglement in TGD framework and Qi blockage could be interpreted as a blockage
preventing transfer of this entanglement (of metabolic energy in standard framework).
The physiological, chemical and electromagnetic eﬀects of both internal and external Qigong
have been studied ( [J120] contains large number of related references).
Also the eﬀects of
Qigong healing on cancer has been studied [J43] .
Priore’s machine
There is also some empirical support for the idea about healing by time reversal coming already
from the period when only Soviet scientists knew about phase conjugation.
(a) In 1960’s and 1970’s French Antoine Priore built and tested electromagnetic healing ma-
chines of startling eﬀectiveness [I6] . Tom Bearden has in this website document ”The
Priore Machine and Phase Conjugation” which I recommend for an interested reader for
a more detailed exposition [I4] besides the material that can be found from the homepage
of Tom Bearden.
(b) In hundreds of rigorous tests with labotory animals, Priore’s machine cured a wide variety
of the most diﬃcult kinds of terminal, fatal diseases known today. Many of the experiments
and tests were done by prestigious members of the French Academy of Sciences.
The
operation of the Priore machine was incomprehensible for both the inventor and orthodox

French scientists. Into a tube containing a plasma of mercury and neon gas, a pulsed
9.4 GHz wave modulated by a frequency of 17 MHz was introduced.
The waves were
produced by radio emitters and magnetrons in the presence of a 1200 Gauss magnetic
ﬁeld. Experimental animals were exposed to this magnetic ﬁeld during irradiation, and
the mixture of waves (about 17 or so) coming from the plasma tube and modulating and
riding the magnetic ﬁeld passed through the animals’ bodies.
The following observations suggests that TGD inspired model for bio-control and communication
might allow to understand the claimed ﬁndings.
(a) A combination of magnetic ﬁelds and radiation was involved: this conforms with the vision
about biosystems as a manysheeted ionic ﬂow equilibrium controlled by MEs attached to
ﬂux tubes and sheets.
(b) It is known that phase conjugated waves can be produced in plasmas.
The so called
four-wave interaction of waves of equal frequency is the simplest manner to amplify weak
wave in the eﬀective dynamical diﬀraction grating deﬁned by the interference of two waves
propagating in opposite directions. If a phase conjugate wave with a correct frequency
results in this kind of situation, it could act as a reference wave acting with ME and
initiate a complex time reversed biological programs at subcellular level.
Metabolism is what drives biological programs and their time reversal could involve the time
reversal of the basic metabolic mechanism.
(a) According to the quantum model of metabolism [K35] , ADP-ATP cycle corresponds to
a cyclic ﬂow of protons between some larger space-time sheet (say k = 169) and k = 137
atomic space-time sheet. The so called F0 −F1 machine transforming ADP to ATP drives
the biological Karma’s cycle kicking protons to the atomic space-time sheet, where they
dissipate their energy and drop back to the magnetic ﬂux tubes liberating their zero point
kinetic energy of about .5 eV. TGD suggest the existence of metabolisms associated with
other ions and between other space-time sheet pairs, and the universal energy currencies
of these metabolisms are characterized by the zero point kinetic energies of the ion in
question. Standard metabolism is a particular example of this general process, and there
might exist analogs of F0 −F1 machines corresponding to other metabolisms. The cycle of
ATPase motor is of order 300 Hz, which is the proton cyclotron frequency in the endogenous
magnetic ﬁeld of .2 Gauss.
(b) The cyclotron frequency of the ions are assumed to be key frequencies in bio-control. Cy-
clotron frequency MEs server as space-time correlates of quantum entanglement, and the
MEs with frequencies corresponding to zero point kinetic energies propagate along these
MEs and induce self-organization at the receiving end. CDs deﬁne a further important
time and frequency scale related to that for electron by the formula T(k) = 2k−127 ×r ×.1
seconds, r = ℏ/ℏ0.
Here corresponds the p-adic prime characterizing the elementary
particle. A basic speculation is that light fractally scaled counterparts of elementary par-
ticles with Compton lengths corresponding to biologically important Gaussian Mersennes
k = 151, 157, 163, 167 could be relevant for biology. These time scales vary in the range
1.6 × 106 s -6.4 × 109 s (18.5 days- 205.8 years)
(c) Genes are the basic motor instruments of cell and the healing mechanism might aﬀect
directly the biological programs at this level.
DNA as topological quantum computer
paradigm would suggest that these programs are in in reserved time direction and that
the size of structures involved is of order of typical unit of genome.
(d) Healing process could correspond to the functioning of these machines in a time reversed
mode: the generator becomes a motor. Even ordinary metabolism might become time re-
versed temporarily during healing process. Perhaps the fact that metabolism is minimized
during rest, would allow also F0 −F1 generators to temporarily run in the time reversed
mode.

Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
(e) Four-wave interaction is believed to be involved with the generation of the phase conjugates
of microwaves. The direct irradiation by the phase conjugates of a microwave beam at
critical frequency might be a simpler manner to induce the healing process at DNA level.
By its extreme generality this mechanism could apply to almost any disease which is a disease
of the highest level quantum biocontrol.
This mechanism could be also used to induce de-
diﬀerentiation of cells.
The de-diﬀerentiation of cells to stem cells could be controlled by a
similar mechanism. One can also wonder whether this kind of mechanism could make possible
eternal youth (or rather eternal life) at cell level. An interesting question is whether the phase
conjugates of EEG waves or time reversals of nerve pulse patterns could induce time reversals
of brain functions.
One should of course be able to understand whether and why the frequencies used are special.
The following represents the guesses inspired by the p-adic length scale hypothesis and cyclotron
frequency hypothesis.
(a) The eﬀects of ELF em ﬁelds on vertebrate brain occur at cyclotron frequencies. Also in this
case higher carrier frequency is used but its function is to make possible the penetration of
the modulating ELF radiation to the tissue. Let us assume that 9.4 GHz radiation serves
for a similar purpose.
(b) Electron’s cyclotron frequency in a magnetic ﬁeld of Bend, Bend = .2 Gauss, the diﬀerence
between n = 3 and n = 0 cyclotron frequencies of electron is in good approximation 17
MHz. This would suggests that cyclotron phase transition for electrons from n = 0 to
n = 3 level is involved with the mechanism. This would support the assignment of proton
cyclotron frequency for Bend = .2 Gauss with ATPase motor and mean that both electrons
and protons are important for the function of the machine.
(c) For the standard value of Planck constant the frequencies correspond to energies much
below the thermal energy at room temperature. The value of 17 MHz would suggest a
value of order 107ℏ0 for the Planck constant. Negentropic entanglement might allow to
circumvent this constraint.
(d) The ratio of B = .12 Tesla to Bend is B/Bend = 6 × 103 ≃3 ≃211. The magnetic length
LB ∝
p
ℏ/eB characterizes the thickness of the ﬂux tubes required by the minimum
value of magnetic ﬂux. The magnetic ﬁeld used corresponds to about 10−7 meters for
the standard value of Planck constant and to a length scale about 10−4 m for ℏ∼107ℏ0.
For the ordinary value of Planck constant the corresponding space-time sheet could be
associated with chromomose’s basic structure and correspond to k = 157 space-time sheet
associated with chromosome’s coiling.
Note that the time size of the CD assignal to
k = 157 p-adic length scale is 230 ≃.1 s ≃108 s. Optimistically one could imagine that
correction of the genetic error responsible for the cancer program by time reversal might
be in question. In particular, it could induce the time reversal of the ’develop-cancer’
program controlling the development of the cancer cell population and lead to healing
when the standard time direction is re-established.
11.3.2
DelaWarr camera and ﬁeld representation of genetic informa-
tion
In CASYS’2001 symposium Peter Marcer [I26] told about the British engineer George DelaWarr
who built a remote imaging camera in the 1950’s (radionics is the term used). Using only a test
object provided from the subject such as a small blood, sputum, or hair sample, this device is
reported to photographically image the subject’s internal conditions at a distance, with a high
degree of accuracy. A unique feature of the DelaWarr system is claimed to be that it is able
to detect diseases in the pre-clinical stages prior to detection by conventional techniques such
as physical examination, X-ray, CT scan, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The photographs
taken by DelaWarr camera at ﬁfties were treated by Susan Benford by modern image processing
techniques and she claims that these photographs contain the information needed to reconstruct

11.4. Parapsychological phenomena
579
three-dimensional holograms [I26] . The proposed explanation was that the test object (adjunct)
contains a hologrammic representation about the patient.
The functioning DelaWarr camera looks highly mysterious even when one takes seriously the
idea that DNA generates holograms of the body parts it codes for. Therefore it is better to
introduce the ingredients of the model as questions rather than hypothesis.
(a) Was the intent of the photographer all that was needed and did other levels levels of the
self hierarchy take care of the rest as they do when I make the decision to raise my hand?
Could the intent of the photographer have generated a reference wave at some very special
frequency acting on the adjunt and activating a hologram giving rise to a photograph
about the desired body part or inducing a sequence of events leading eventually to the
generation of the photograph?
(b) Was the visible light giving rise to the photograph generated in the adjunct? Does the DNA
of each cell of body and thus also of the adjunct contain electromagnetic representations
for the body parts and are these representations more or less equivalent with holograms?
Certainly direct hologrammic images about body parts would provide the simplest manner
to realize the ﬁeld part of the genetic code as proposed.
(c) Did the adjunct serve as a relay station (somewhat like thalamus in brain) mediating the
information from the patient via magnetic ﬂux tube-ME pairs to the camera projecting
it to the camera as a coherent light generating an ordinary photograph? Was the image
realized as a coherent light propagating along the MEs connecting adjunct and patient
serving as bridges? Could the negentropic entanglement between the adjunct and subject
stabilize the connection.
Could the radiation correspond to large ℏradiation at much
lower frequencies than that for visible light and transforming to ordinary visible light in
the camera?
11.4
Parapsychological phenomena
In this section various parapsychological phenomena are discussed in the general framework
introduced in the previous section.
11.4.1
Extrasensory perception, precognition, and other parapsychic
eﬀects
The general model for paranormal eﬀects relies on same basic ideas as the model of quantum
biology.
(a) The transformation of p-adic [K52] space-time sheets makes possible the transformation of
intentions to actions. Since p-adic space-time sheets have literally inﬁnite size in real sense,
distance does not matter. The set of points in the intersection of p-adic and corresponding
real space-time sheet obeying same algebraic equations consists of rational and possibly
also algebraic points common to real and p-adic variants of imbedding space.
Paraphychological phenomena involve the transfer of information and negentropic entan-
glement makes possible genuine information at quantum level as also breaking of the second
law of thermodynamics in the time scale of CD in question. Hence remote mental inter-
actions should involve the generation of negentropic entanglement irrespective of whether
the target is living system or consists of ”dead” matter.
(b) The idea about ﬁeld body serving eﬀectively as an intentional agent is second element of
the model. The topological light rays representing negative energy signals propagating
into geometric past created by a transformation of p-adic space-time sheet to a real one
might be said to represent the ”desire” inducing neural activities in the brain of geometric

580
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
past. This mechanism provides not only a model for how magnetic body uses biological
body as a motor instrument but also for PK.
MEs acting as bridges between diﬀerent organisms would mediate em oscillations allow a
directed transmission of smaller MEs behaving eﬀectively as particles moving with light
velocity. These MEs could be both real and p-adic and -using the terminology of Qigong
practice- would represent qi (action) and yi (intention) respectively. An essential element
would be resonance: sender and receiver in should be accompanied by MEs characterized
by the same fundamental frequency: only these MEs could resonantly connect healer and
healee. Healer must have ability to continuously vary the healing frequency.
MEs would naturally correspond to pairs of positive and negative energy space-time sheets.
They would be attached to magnetic ﬂux tubes and magnetic mirrors consisting of two
ﬂux sheets would make possible sensory-motor loop.
(c) Zero energy ontology justiﬁes the notion of negative energy signals and brings in also
CDs as correlates of selves and natural fundamental targets of remote mental interactions.
Zero energy ontology and the new view about time allows to assume that sensory qualia
are at the level of sensory organ (objections such as phantom leg phenomenon can be
circumvented) and that symbolic representations of objects of perceptive ﬁeld and their
attributes reside in brain.
Sensory input generates sensory representations based on real space-time sheets possibly
accompanied by p-adic cognitive space-time sheets. Field body can share these mental
images by quantum entanglement and also receive sensory information as classical signals
involving using frequency coding and coding by temporal patters. These latter represen-
tations would correspond to cognitive and emotional aspects associated with the sensory
input. One could even say that higher level sensory representations are somatosensory ex-
periences of ﬁeld body. The intersection points of real and p-adic space-time sheet would
determine the physical cognitive representation and would be always discrete. The analogy
with the discreteness of numerics should be noticed. Since this model would apply also
to extrasensory perception, the attribute ”extrasensory” becomes somewhat misleading
attribute.
(d) Extrasensory perception could also result from the direct electromagnetic perturbation of
the sensory magnetic canvas outside the body and the sounds generated by auroras and
meteors might be genuine ”extrasensory” perceptions of this kind [K65] . The frequency
spectrum for the sounds produced by meteors and detected both sensorily and electron-
ically in in the range 37 −44 Hz [F1] , which is the range of thalamocortical resonance
frequencies associated with sensory representations in magnetic sensory canvas model. The
sounds are several orders of magnitude more intense than they should be unless em per-
turbations propagate to Earth in a channelled manner. Only few meteors generate these
sounds. These observations suggest that a resonant ampliﬁcation of the em perturbations
by magnetic mirrors of the sensory canvas channelling the em ﬁeld to the surface of Earth
are in question.
(e) One might argue that if memes are not universal, remote cognition is not very useful.
If memetic and genetic codes are realized in terms of CDs of quarks and leptons, one
would have universality. If DNA double strand provides the relay station through which
sensory input and motor output of the magnetic body ﬂows, one would achieve universality
of communication and control mechanismcs at the level of living matter. An interesting
question is whether memes are really species-spesiﬁc as the morphic ﬁelds are in Sheldrake’s
theory. The ability of shamans to transform at the level of conscious experience to animals
suggests that this might not be the case. There is also a famous real life story about a
student who spend several days in the experiental world of dog. Various identiﬁcation
phenomena would very probably involve also magnetic mirrors acting as bridges between
say shaman and animal (or possibly multibody collective self deﬁning ’species self’) and
making possible to share the experience of animal. Same mechanism as in the case of long
term memories would be in question but with personal memories being replaced with the
experiences of another species.

11.4. Parapsychological phenomena
581
The fact that p-adic space-time sheets have literally inﬁnite size suggests that cognition and
intentionality are cosmic phenomena and that there might be cosmic pool of shared cognitive
mental images. Hence memes could be completely universal.
11.4.2
Psychokinesis
One can classify psychokinesis to various types depending on whether the target is living or
”dead” and whether the eﬀect on target is a mere transfer of energy and momentum or control
action involving information transfer.
Below I brieﬂy discuss an early TGD inspired model of PK, a general model of PK assuming
time mirror mechanism of ordinary intentional action but applied by the magnetic body of the
operator to a system diﬀerent from the biological body, and a more speciﬁc model for machine-
human interactions. Also concrete examples of various kinds of PK eﬀects are discussed.
A possible model for psychokinesis with non-machine targets
In [K93] a mechanism of psychokinesis based on the generation of wormhole magnetic ﬁeld con-
ﬁgurations making possible levitation was proposed. Although this mechanism was yet general
it deserves a discussion and reader is recommended to see [K93] for details. Basic mechanism is
the levitation of diamagnetic substances in an external magnetic ﬁeld: the force results when the
diamagnetic substance repels external magnetic ﬁeld from its interior. The force is essentially
the gradient of the net magnetic energy inside the volume deﬁned by the object.
The mechanism is purely TGD based and relies on the generation of a pair of space-time sheets
having opposite time orientations, and carrying opposite magnetic ﬁelds and opposite energy
densities, and the subsequent interaction of the second space-time sheet with the object moved
in the psychokinesis. Exactly the same mechanism applies in case of MEs (massless extremals)
and could be used to generate coherent locomotion of organism resulting as a recoil eﬀect when
the second ME is absorbed by the body part. MEs provide a candidate for the mechanism of
psychokinesis.
TGD based general view about PK
A general TGD based explanation psychokinesis relies on the same fundamental mechanism as
ordinary intentional action, long term memory, and remote metabolism.
The model applies
more or less as such also to telepathy and could also allow to understand the notion of water
memory explaining homeopathic eﬀects.
(a) The basic mechanism of PK and retro PK relies on quantum jumps transforming the p-
adic space-time sheets representing intentions to real space-time sheets representing desires
represented as negative energy signals to the geometric past. These signals modify the
output of say random number generator to a non-random one.
Magnetic ﬂux quanta
would realize the bridges along with the negative energy signals would propagate. The
mechanism would favor retro PK if the operator is in active role. Genuine PK is also
possible but in this case target would be active sucking metabolic energy provided by the
operator.
(b) Negative energy signals could consists of dark phase conjugate photons or even massless W
bosons since TGD allows scaled up variants of electro-weak gauge bosons with large Planck
constant and arbitrarily small mass scales. Dark W bosons are especially interesting since
they can induce charged entanglement and purely non-local charge transfer mechanism
and have been proposed to play a key role in the generation of the nerve pulse.
(c) Magnetic ﬂux quanta are the bridges making possible (presumably) unconscious feedback
so that the operator can unconsciously learn how to aﬀect the machine. How intentions can
have eﬀect on system whose functioning is unknown to the operator is actually the basic

582
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
mystery of, not only psychokinesis, but of remote healing and remote mental interaction
in general, as also of the phenomena labelled as instrumental transcommunications (ITC).
The learning by feedback, much analogous to that happens when we learn to drive bicycle,
would solve this mystery. The eﬀects of group activity could be understood if groups tend
to form collective selves so that coherent ampliﬁcation of the eﬀect occurs.
(d) The ability of the PK able person to imagine the desired eﬀect is important and could
correspond to the ability to generate p-adic space-time sheets representing the intention.
The desire about the action represented by the corresponding real space-time sheet should
induce the eﬀect optimally. In personal discussions with a PK-able psychic I indeed learned
that he always tried to imagine in every possible detail how he moved the physical object
(say a box of matches). The role of imagination is important also in remote healing [J120]
. Perhaps the p-adic pseudo constants made possible by the non-determinism of p-adic
diﬀerential equations should be in a good approximation genuine constants.
(e) The optimal targets are initial value sensitive- or more generally-critical.
i. Quantum criticality is the basic characteristic of TGD Universe and the prediction
is the existence of a hierarchy of criticalities. Number theoretical criticality would in
turn characterize living matter and might be a characteristic of optimal targets.
ii. Also quantum criticalin in the sense that several values of Planck constant are possible
with large values of ℏassignable to negative energy signals mediating the desire of
the PK-able person. PK requires energy and this favors systems, which can utilize
standardized metabolic energy quanta liberated in the dropping of particles to larger
space-time sheets.
iii. Water would be an optimal system from the point of PK and retro PK. Homeopathy
might indeed involve PK like aspects. Benveniste’s experiments [I14, I15] gave support
for the notion of water memory but could not be replicated when the experimenters
did not know in which bottles the treated water was.
The preservation of water
memories represented in terms of many-sheeted lasers for with 1/0 corresponds to a
population inverted state/ground state, requires metabolic energy feed and the system
might suck this metabolic energy from the biological body of the experimenter [K32]
.
(f) As noticed, the proposed model is extremely general and seems to apply to almost any
paranormal phenomena. For instance, the claimed re-incarnation experiences could be
understood in terms of the general mechanism for long term memory. The person who
remembers having lived in past could share mental images of a person in the geometric
past by time like entanglement (episodal memory), or could be able to communicate with
negative energy signals to the brain of a person on geometric past memory recall and thus
receive declarative memories. It is quite possible that survival of ﬁttest in our culture
has led to an evolution of an immune system preventing sharing of mental images and
communications with other brains.
Machine-mind interactions
Machine-mind interactions represent a modern branch of parapsychological research and nowa-
days methodologically highly advanced. These interactions are studied several groups and indi-
viduals: mention only the Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research (PEAR), which is a group
directed by Prof. Jahn, the Anomalous Cognition Project of Dick Bierman, and the retropsy-
chokinesis work of Helmut Schmidt. In the sequel some aspects of this work are discussed.
The generation of negentropic time like entanglement between operator and target leading to
a superposition of pre-existing and desired zero energy states and a subsequent increase of the
amplitude of the desired outcome could be the general mechanism of machine mind interactions.
’Who known how?’ is a highly relevant question in the case experiments involving the attempt
of operator to aﬀect the function of a machine like computer whose detailed functioning is not
known for the operator. This question could have two answers. Either the operator learns to

11.4. Parapsychological phenomena
583
who to aﬀect the outcome by the simple sensory-motor loop provided by MEs or there is third
party who knows and corresponds to a higher collective level of consciousness.
1. Retro psychokinesis with random number generators
The analysis of experiments [J31, J32, J80] discussed in the [K86] suggests that the geometric
past can change in the time scale of a fraction of second. Both the work done at PEAR [J52] and
the work of Helmut Schmidt with retro psychokinesis [J117] provide support for the change of the
geometric past in much longer time scales. PEAR experiments demonstrate the anomalous eﬀect
also in the direction of future. For instance, the experiments of Schmidt done 1992 discussed in
New Scientist [J41] demonstrate that martial art students were able to aﬀect the visual display
determined by pre-recorded random numbers. The probability for this kind of deviations from
non-randomness was about 1/1000. Henry Stapp proposed an explanation for this in his paper
published in Phys. Rev. A [J124] based on nonlinear quantum mechanics.
The change of also geometric past in the quantum jump between quantum histories implies the
notion of a four-dimensional physical reality and forces to regard three-dimensionality of reality
as illusion created by the 3-dimensionality of our sensory experience (recall the notion of the
association sequence). This implies that our geometric past is changing all the subjective time
and that communications to the geometric past and future are possible and are consistent with
the weak causality violation hypothesis of Schmidt [J117] . What this hypothesis implies that
in the newest quantum history generated by RPK all separate records contain the pre-recorded
random numbers are altered in the same manner in RPK. Schmidt has tested weak causality
hypothesis by using two separate cassette tapes containing the pre-recorded random numbers,
one used in the PK experiment and another one kept locked in a safe. The records were indeed
found to be identical after the experiment.
The results of Schmidt suggest also classical signalling to the direction of the geometric past.
Real space-time sheets with negative time orientation could serve as the geometric correlates for
these signals.
2. The work of Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research group
The study of anomalies in human-machine anomalies provide a highly sophisticated and con-
trolled manner to study psychokinesis in its various forms. For instance, in the experiments
carried out in PEAR group (Princeton Engineering Anomalies Research) [J52] operators try to
aﬀect various kinds of electronic, mechanical, acoustical, optical and ﬂuid devices. In unattended
calibrations these devices yield random output whereas in the experimental situation operator
tries intentionally to aﬀect the output so that non-randomness results. Each input that operator
tries to aﬀect consists of 200 bits formed from a random physical signal and operator can have
either the intention to increase the number of 1:s (high) , the number of 0:s (low) or have no in-
tention at all (baseline). Operators can exert their eﬀorts from a distance of thousands of miles,
before or after the the actual operation of the devices. Over the laboratory’s 20-year history,
thousands of such experiments, involving about 100 millions of trials, have been performed by
several hundred operators.
The observed eﬀects can be summarized as the average for the sum of bits which is 100.026 for
high and 99.984 for low. The eﬀect is by a factor 3.6 higher than the expected margin of error.
Eﬀects are thus quite small, of the order of a few parts in ten thousand on average, but they are
statistically repeatable and compound to highly signiﬁcant deviations from chance expectations.
Eﬀects are highly operator speciﬁc and there are signiﬁcant disparities between male and female
performances. The random devices respond also to the group activities of large numbers of
people and are especially sensitive to the eﬀect of small intimate groups, group rituals, sacred
rites, musical and theatrical performances, and charismatic events.
Time mirror mechanism suggests the following model for the machine-human interactions en-
countered in say PEAR experiments.
(a) The eﬀect of intention could be on the generator of random noise, on bit sequence rep-
resented in the computer memory, or even on the recorded value of the sum of bits. A

584
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
possible mechanism in the latter two cases is the reversal of electromagnetically represented
bit.
(b) The general mechanism of intentional action involves negative energy signals inducing a
change in the charge distribution determining the value of bit. Negative energy photon
could induce a dropping of ions to a larger space-time sheet. Also the emission of negative
energy dark W bosons (appearing in TGD based model of nerve pulse) could induce a
change in the net charge.
In both cases the sign of charge would correlate with the
character of intention and for the ﬁrst mechanism there would be asymmetry between
”high” and ”low” (proton, electron).
3. The work of William Tiller
[J131] [J131, J132, J133, J136] has performed experiments involving intentional imprinting of
targets such as water. The model for the ﬁndings of Tiller is discussed in [K8] . The imprinting
manifested itself as temporal and spatial oscillations of pH and temperature. The surprising
ﬁnding was conditioning: also the air around intentionally imprinted device exhibited these
oscillations.
Also computer could be conditioned.
The Fourier transform of the correlation
function for bit sequences of random number generator demonstrated peaks at harmonics of
f = 1/T, T = 113.778 min. 2n-multiple of .1 seconds for n = 16 would correspond to k = 143and
T = 109.23 minutes which is by about 4 per cent too small.
The proposed assignment of
cyclotron photons with motor action leads to ask whether large ℏdark cyclotron photons with
these frequencies could induce a periodic perturbation of the random bit sequence?
Robots, chickens, rabbits and men
The interaction between random number generators and humans or animals is one form of
psychokinesis. For a few years ago the issue 62 of ”Network”, the journal of the Scientiﬁc Medical
Network [J97] contained a report about the experiments carried out by Dr. Rene Peoch, working
at Fondation ODIER at Nantes. In these experiments chickens and rabbits apparently inﬂuenced
signals composed by a random-number generator for a robot close to them, and human subjects
apparently inﬂuenced the movements of the robot even though its signals had been generated
by a random-number computer program six months earlier.
Chickens stayed close to the robot ”imprinted” on it as their mother and followed it about.
The robot had a random-number generator inside it controlling its movements, which checks
showed to be truly random. The chickens were then removed and one placed so it could see
the robot but could not follow it. Under these circumstances the robot spent measurably more
time close to the chicken than away from it. The eﬀect was that the chick was inﬂuencing the
robot’s generator. The generator was then removed to a computer away from the experimental
area. The same eﬀect occurred. ”Non-imprinted” chickens however had no apparent eﬀect on
the robot.
In the rabbit experiment, baby rabbits were frightened by the robot and kept away from it.
When the rabbits’ movement was inhibited, the robot’s movements became non-random and it
kept away from them. However, when one rabbit was starved and food was placed on the robot,
this behavior was reversed and the robot brought the food to the rabbit. It was found that
humans likewise could inﬂuence the robot.
Also humans were invited to inﬂuence the robot as before, but in fact it was being driven by
a code generated six months earlier and recorded on a CD, now being played back. The robot
was inﬂuenced as in the contemporary study. The CD was then examined and it was found
that the ﬁrst half of its code was indeed non-random, but the unused code was truly random.
This gave the eﬀect that the computer somehow ”knew” six months earlier not only that half
the code would be used for such an experiment, but also the general direction of the movements
that would be required.
The interpretation of the reported results in terms of psychokinesis and human-animal-machine
symbiosis suggests itself. The experiment with humans can also be interpreted as a dramatic

11.4. Parapsychological phenomena
585
veriﬁcation for the prediction that in quantum jumps between quantum histories also the geo-
metric past changes: the recent experiment suggests that the change occurred in a time scale of
six months. If the crucial assumption about the randomness of the random number generator
is correct, the eﬀect is also very strong. This could mean that we are changing our geometric
past all the subjective time in macro-temporal time scales, as indeed suggested by the paradigm
of four-dimensional brain. A further suggestion is that this hypothesis can be indeed tested
empirically by developing further these experimental arrangements.
To better comprehend what might be involved, recall that in TGD subjective time and geomet-
ric time are not one and the same thing. Accordingly, subjective memories are memories about
conscious experiences and geometric memories are memories with respect to the geometric time
for which time is in a precisely same position as space: geometric memories give prediction of
the future and past changing quantum jump by quantum jump like weather broadcasts (except
that one usually is not interested in the predictions of what weather will subjectively be in
geometrically last summer). The crucial point is that the contents of say computer ﬁles rep-
resenting purely geometric memories (such as number sequencies) can change in the quantum
jumps whereas the possible subjective memories about their contents can remain unchanged.
This peculiar contradiction between subjective and geometric memories, which I have christened
as ’tribar eﬀect’, serves as a possible experimental test for the reality of notions of the subjective
and geometric time. These experiments are bound to involve human memory as a subjective
element: nothing however prevents several human subjects store to their memory the original
memory to guarantee objectivity in a statistical sense.
If the randomness of the original random number series produced six months before the exper-
iment involving human-robot interaction has not been checked, it can be argued that random
number generators (if genuine) accidentally produced a number series which was not random in
the time scale involved. This problem could be circumvented by modifying the experiment by
checking already six months earlier whether the number series is really random or not. Humans
can indeed remember whether the series is genuinely random or not although they are not able
to remember long number series. On the other hand, if the non-randomization eﬀect appears
only under special conditions (eﬀect is present for the imprinted chickens only), one has even
without the check good reasons to believe that machine-mind interaction has occurred.
An important question of principle is whether the random number generators are genuine or
whether the numbers are generated by some algorithm yielding only pseudo random numbers. If
genuine randomness is due to quantum phenomena at atomic or molecular level, then intentional
action could aﬀect physics at atomic and molecular level. Of course, the success of p-adic mass
calculation and interpretation of p-adic physics as physics of cognition and intention forces the
same conclusion. If some algorithm produced them and there is no noise aﬀecting the outcome,
the only changes which can occur is the modiﬁcation of the algorithm or of the initial conditions
for the algorithm. In the latter case the production of the desired behavior might however be
impossible since the algorithm need not even allow the needed regular behavior of the random
number sequence. This of course could be checked.
p-Adic space-time sheets representing intentions/memes should be transformed to their real
counterparts realized as negative energy signals and able to interact with random number gen-
erators. If the p-adic memes are actually chicken’s intentions mediated by magnetic mirrors
and transformed to real ones when intention is realized, the interaction mechanism is basically
ordinary electromagnetic interaction with the machine. The question about the detailed mech-
anism allowing chicken’s volition to aﬀect the geometric past of the robot allows endless variety
of answers. One possibility suggested by the more precise views about psychological time is
that the robot has primitive consciousness and that the p-adic-to-real phase transition of robot
proceeding to the direction of geometric future is undone by the reverse real-to-padic phase
transition down to the moment when the random numbers were generated and regeneration of
them occurs and gives rise to a new chicken friendly behavior. Again trial and error might be
involved.
The results of experiments, if replicable, suggest that animal-machine anomalous interactions
might be much stronger than human-machine interactions, perhaps because animal is totally
conﬁdent that the desired interaction happens (Blessed are the meek since they will inherit the

586
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
kingdom of Heaven!). One could imagine experimental arrangements analogous to the chicken-
robot experiments in which the chicken is replaced by a human who genuinely believes that
the robot can do what (s)he wishes: this could be achieved by telling the subject person that
machine is programmed to deduce her/his wishes, from say EEG. Various modiﬁcations of the
imprinting mechanism could be applied in more complicated situation. The results might be
also used as guidelines in the attempts to generate artiﬁcial life. The systematic use of genuine
random number generators as control tools of robotic motion suggests itself as a basic principle
to guide the attempts to build artiﬁcial life. This would optimize the ﬂexibility of the robot
behavior so that it could be aﬀected by the p-adic intentions.
Adaptive robots as an electronic life form?
The construction of artiﬁcial life by building initial value sensitive robots might be a possible
breakthrough application of the p-adic cognition. What would be needed is just initial value
sensitivity: p-adic memes would take care of the resst.
Mark Tilden is a wellknown builder of robots working in the nuclear physics laboratory of Los
Alamos. Tilden builds his robots by using pieces of used electronics. The robots do not run
any computer program so that the basic philosophy is more or less a diametrical opposite of
AI. Rather, the wiring of the robots is such that in a new situation robot tries for diﬀerent
behaviors. For instance, if robot leg gets stuck, the robot changes the orbit of motion of leg.
What is remarkable that the robots seem to behave like living organisms in some aspects.
Unfortunately, I do not have any scientiﬁc articles about Tilden’s work apart from short descrip-
tion in his homepage [J23] . In fact, I encountered competely accidentally about Tilden’s work
by reading an article in the Finnish version of Reader’s Digest August 1998 after having seen
Stetsoned Tilden and his tiny robots in a popular science program in Finnish TV telling about
the recent situation in robotics, AI, and artiﬁcial life. The robots of Tilden have surprising
abilities to adapt and compete for energy which they get from the sunlight. Robots seem to
literally ﬁght for the sunlight. For instance, an electronic fellow called Turbot, kills other robots
from his territory and collects them to form a wall against the invasion of other invaders!
The claimed adaptive feats of these robots suggest that a primitive lifeform is in question and this
is also the belief of Mark Tilden. A general handwaving explanation for the adaptive behavior
is that these systems are at the borderline between chaos and order and adaptive behavior
’emerges’. Of course, what ’emergence’ means is a complete mystery in the deterministic physics
with quantum eﬀects absent in macroscopic length scales.
That primitive life form might be in question, ﬁts nicely with the TGD view. First of all, all
forms of self-organization involve quantum jumps and consciousness, and the question is only
how important is the role of cognitive consciousness in the behavior of the system. Cognitive
consciousness can become important only if the system is suﬃciently ﬂexible and initial value
sensitive so that the realization of intentional motor actions becomes possible by p-adic-to-real
transformations inducing critical perturbations to the initial-value sensitive behavior.
The in-built ﬂexibility of the robot behavior (a strict opposite of pre-programmed behavior),
and initial value sensitivity make in principle possible self-organization by quantum jumps and
eﬀective quantum control. For instance, robots could contain modules controlled by genuine
random number generators which would be aﬀected by p-adic memes.
If p-adic physics is
physics of cognition, Nature itself guarantees, that robots form cognitive representations, and
by the ﬂexibility of their motor system, they are able to transform cognitive representations to
motor actions. If p-adic space-time sheets are indeed memes ﬂoating around and waiting for the
opportunity to materialize themselves to action, the robots of Tilden could provide an excellent
opportunity for a meme to reincarnate!
The extreme generality of the p-adic physics means that one cannot exclude the possibility that
electronic systems could quite generally develop p-adic cognitive representations about itself.
If so, can one guarantee that the old electronic components recycled by Tilden do not diﬀer
cognitively from electronic components coming directly from fabric? If they do, two identical
robots built from old and new components might behave diﬀerently. Thus a test for whether

11.4. Parapsychological phenomena
587
the robots have mentality and some kind of developing personality is whether two physically
identical robots behave diﬀerently under similar circumstances.
Quite generally, one can identify p-adic cognitive representations as the mechanism which gives
the physical system personality and allowing to distinguish even between two electrons p-adically:
of course, Fermi statistics does not allow a state consisting of two electrons in states diﬀering only
cognitively. Quite generally, this kind of test could be the counterpart of Turing test allowing
to deduce whether physical system has cognitive self or not.
Also now negentropic entanglement and the universality of CD time scales raise the hopes that
it might be possible to understand what is involved.
Telekinesis and electrostatics
In the book ”Mind at Large” edited by Tart, Puthoﬀ, and Targ there is an article ”An Investi-
gation of Soviet Psychical Research” by Wortz et al reporting among other things the research
related to the electrostatic aspects of telekinesis. The article mentions the work done by Vasiliev
and associates with Nina Kulagina and the work of Adamenko with Alla Vinogradova, another
highly gifted person in telekinesis. Kulagina and Vinogradova are said to have been able to
move objects of .1 kg along table. Interestingly, according to the article PK able persons tend to
be women. Adamenko has tried to understand the phenomenon theoretically and has proposed
that the static charges of objects and electrostatic forces generated by the subject might explain
the eﬀects.
Adamenko’s work
The objects moved by subject persons were located at a table which was a di-electric cube with
of side length of .5 meters in Adamenko’s experiments.
(a) Vinogradova was able to induce an electric charge in cube and then move objects located
at the cube. With biofeedback training also other subjects were able to replicate Vino-
gradova’s feat.
(b) To move the object the static friction (friction coeﬃcient between .1 and .3) must be
overcome. Adamenko theorizes that there is kind of buyonancy force caused by the ﬂow
of air molecules involved and that the electric ﬁeld somehow induces this force.
(c) The reported electric ﬁeld was 10 kV/cm and corresponds to the voltage at which a di-
electric breakdown occurs in a dry air. The reported movement of the air could correspond
to a corona wind resulting at strong electric ﬁelds.
(d) Adamenko assumes that the objects had either static charge or that they were polarizable
and developed a dipole moment in the external electric ﬁeld. The electrostatic interaction
with the electric ﬁeld induced by Vinogradova would have been the cause of the movement.
TGD based model
TGD based model for phenomena is based on the general mechanism of mind-matter interactions
allowed by the many-sheeted space-time concept. There are three questions to be answered: How
the table and possibly also object were charged?; How the motion of the object was caused?;
How the object was lifted from table to circument friction force? How the table and object were
charged? The charging of the table is certainly crucial for the PK eﬀect. Vinogradova could
have emitted ”topological lightrays” (MEs), as a matter fact high frequency (microwave) MEs
propagating like particles within low frequency (ELF) MEs. Negative energy ELF MEs could
have served as correlates for entanglement. Entanglement is however not necessary in this case
since conscious telepathy is not involved. Microwave MEs would have induced bridges between
the atomic space-time sheets of the object and super-conducting magnetic ﬂux tubes of Earth.
The bridges would have made possible ionic and electronic currents between these space-time

588
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
sheets and led to the charging of the table and possibly of also object. A suitable intentional
targeting of MEs would allow to control the charge distributions of the table and object and
therefore the pattern of the induced electrostatic ﬁelds.
What could have produced the motion of the object?
The interaction of the object with the electrostatic ﬁeld of the table is a possible explanation
for the PK eﬀect. The distribution of the charges of the table and object would allow to control
the ﬁeld pattern and thus the direction of the electrostatic force. This is however not the only
mechanism. Ionic currents from the magnetic ﬂux tubes to the atomic space-time sheets of
the object produce recoil eﬀect (momentum is conserved only in many-sheeted space-time, not
for single space-time sheet), and this could have been the fundamental mechanism of motion
(essentially the mechanism of rocket motion). In both cases the subject would have produced
only the ME bridges taking care of the control of motion but would not have provided the energy
and momentum.
The experiments of Modanese and Podkletnov [H7] provide support for the mechanism. Modanese
and Podkletnov studied capacitor at a rather low temperature and at a voltage near the di-
eleectric breakdown voltage. The second electrode was a super-conducting disk. The resulting
discharge was large and coherent and accompanied by radiation pulses of unknown type. The
pulses induced the motion of the air and kicked test penduli. The force was proportional to
the mass of the penduli. The eﬀect caused by the pulses did not weaken with distance. This
supports the view that the pulses were TGD counterparts of the Tesla’s scalar waves and in-
duced temporary bridges between test penduli and magnetic ﬂux tubes inducing the ﬂow of ions
and the recoil eﬀect. The same mechanism should be at work as a microscopic and incoherent
version in the case of lifters.
How to circumvent the friction?: a connection with the physics of lifters
Lifters exhibit the called Biefeld-Brown eﬀect [K82] . Lifters are asymmetric capacitors consisting
typically of a wire electrode and planar electrode, are in a voltage slightly above the voltage
causing di-electric breakdown. Lifters move in the direction of the smaller electrode. Also the
ﬂow of air from the small electrode to the large one is involved. On basis of the experimentation
and guide the ﬁndings of Juha Hartikka, I ended up with a simple model of lifters. What would
happen is that there is an electric discharge in the form of small plasmoids (discharge sparks
would be analogous to ball lightnings), whose emission from the small electrode causes the recoil
eﬀect. The emission of the scalar wave pulses could induce the motion of the air by Modanese-
Podletnov recoil mechanism. Since the table is charged, there should be a strong electric ﬁeld
also in the narrow space between the object and table. Therefore electronic discharges from the
object could occur, and lead to a small scale lifter eﬀect lifting the object slightly above the
table. This does not require the object to carry a net charge.
Could the remote EEG sensor of Sergeyev be based on the same mechanism as PK?
In the same article also the remote EEG sensor invented by the mathematician Sergeyev claimed
to remote sense EEG from a distance of 5 meters is described. Unfortunately, the information
related to the invention of Sergeyev is classiﬁed. What is however known from the existing
literature is that the sensor is surprisingly simple, consisting of a metal disk suspended into water
and coated with a semiconductor. The immersion in water is reported to double the eﬀectiveness
of the sensor. According to the report, the ordinary EEG sensors can detect EEG only up to
a distance of few centimeters since the noise of the environment masks the (Maxwellian) EEG
at larger distances. Furthermore, the amplifying eﬀect of water is not consistent with the high
value of the di-electric constant of water if ordinary Maxwellian electrodynamics is behind the
sensor.
Sergeyev’s explanation for the functioning of the sensor utilizes bio-plasma hypothesis. The use
of the term bio-plasma is remarkable since professional physicists know that plasma state at the
temperatures and densities of living matter is not possible in standard physics universe. In TGD

11.4. Parapsychological phenomena
589
framework super-conducting ions leaking from the magnetic ﬂux tubes of the Earth’s magnetic
ﬁeld can give rise to what might could be called bio-plasma, and Sergeyev’s sensor is indeed said
to produce bio-plasmagram. Also maser (microwave laser) eﬀect in bio-matter producing ions
and electrons ﬂowing into air is mentioned.
All this suggests that EEG MEs containing microwave MEs inducing a leakage of the ions from
magnetic ﬂux tubes to the atomic space-time sheets of the metal disk and in this manner generate
plasma. The strength of the resulting electric signal would be modulated by the intensity of the
net ﬂux of EEG MEs so that information about EEG would indeed result. EEG MEs would
not topologically condense at atomic space-time sheets but propagate as bridges connecting the
boundaries of the magnetic ﬂux tubes and atomic k = 151 (cell membrane thickness) space-
time sheets. This would explain the dissipation free propagation. For positive energy MEs the
eﬀective phase velocity would be of the same order as the alpha wave phase velocity since these
MEs would tend to ”stuck” (in quantum sense). The basic sensing mechanism would be very
much the same as explaining the generation of nerve pulse. Also Z0 MEs could be involved and
would usually have a very weak interaction with the environment. The ability of water to act
as a many-sheeted maser, presumably crucial for the functioning of living matter, could explain
why the water ampliﬁes the eﬀectiveness of the sensor.
Also the remote sensing of the pulsating magnetic ﬁelds produced by Nina Kalugina and having
strength nearly equal to that of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld are mentioned in the article. The
possible signiﬁcance of the pulsating magnetic ﬁelds for PK is still poorly understood in the
TGD framework: the problem is that solutions of ﬁeld equations representing this kind of ﬁeld
conﬁgurations are not known. One might however think that the pulsating magnetic ﬁelds carry
also supra-currents, and that their presence intensiﬁes the leakage of charged particles to the
atomic space-time sheets of the remote sensor device.
11.4.3
Near death experiences
Near death experiences are rather commonly experienced, say by the victims of various accidents.
These experiences are known for centuries but it was the best-selling book ”Life after Life” of
Raymond Moody which brought these experiences known to the general public [J90] .
1. What NDEs are?
NDEs seem to possess invariantly the same characteristic features. There are feelings of peace
and joy, time speeded up, heightened sense, lost awareness of body, seeing bright light, entering
another world, encountering a mystical being or deceased relatives and coming to a point of no
return. The experiences seem to proceed in quite universal manner. First comes a loud buzzing
or ringing noise and a long dark tunnel. Patient sees his own body from outside and does not
feel any pain or agony anymore. Patient meets others and a being of light who shows his life in
its entirety as a kind of playback to evaluate. Then comes the point of no return, and although
patient feels peace, joy, and love, the patient has to return to continue his life. Often these
experiences induce very profound changes in the subsequent life of the patient. The claims of
Moody have been supported by subsequent research and hardly anyone, even the most foolhardy
skeptic, denies the reality of these experiences.
The latest twist in the development emerged when University of Southampton research team
announced the result of a one-year study of NDEs of victims of a heart attack supporting the
view that consciousness and mind exist after the brain has ceased to function and the body
is clinically dead. The resuscitated patients were various times clinically dead, with no pulse,
no respiration and ﬁxed dilated pupils. Independent EEG studies have conﬁrmed that brain’s
electric activity, and hence brain function (according to standard dogmas of neuro science) ceases
in this kind of situation. 11 per cent of patients who survived the heart arrest however recalled
emotions and visions during this state. This announcement has created considerable excitement
in various consciousness related discussion groups and the question whether some of the basic
dogmas of neuroscience are badly wrong has been raised by the neuroscientists themselves.
2. TGD based view about life after death very concisely

590
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
It is good to summarize the latest TGD based view about consciousness after physical death be-
fore comparison with other theories and detailed analysis of NDEs. The view, which is certainly
not the only possible one can imagine, is supported by the improved view about psychological
time.
The basic notion is that of 4-D body involving both the physical body and the magnetic mirror
structures associated with it. 4-D body is gradually carved like an artwork via p-adic-to-real
phase transitions representing the progress of front of volition to the geometric future and by the
reverse phase transitions deconstructing the 4-D body or its parts. This fractal trial-and-error
construction of the 4-D body occurs in various time and length scales. Gradually increasingly
stable 4-D body results. The volition is concentrated to the front of the p-adic-to-real phase
transition so that the experience of 4-D body for which deconstruction processes occurs only in
the time scales short compared to the duration of lifecycle, would be about entire lifecycle and
in this sense ’timeless’.
The simplest view assumes that the front of volition does not propagate after the physical death.
One could however consider the possibility that the front of volition continues to propagate by
transforming p-adic magnetic mirror structures to real ones: volitional life would continue in
electromagnetic form. This would make possible the communications of the deceased with living
since the resulting real magnetic mirrors could connect the deceased with the living. On the
other hand, the repertoare of possible p-adic mgentic mirror structures would be very wide
because of the p-adic non-determinism.
Since magnetic mirror structures are fundamental for the ﬁeld realization of the genetic code, one
can quite well consider the possibility that this process induces also the self-organization of the
ordinary living matter around the magnetic mirror structures. This would have interpretation
as a reincarnation. Buddhas able to resist the temptation to reincarnate would continue their
life at the ﬁeld level. Interestingly, the development of physics from Newtonian physics of the
material bodies to Maxwellian physics of ﬁelds would mirror the evolution of consciousness from
concrete biological life to life at the ﬁeld level.
3. Astral plane theories for NDEs
There are several theories of NDEs. A theory enjoying popularity in New Age circles is based
on the notions of the astral projection and next world stating that we have another body that is
vehicle of our consciousness which leaves the body at the moment of death. Although completely
respectable as such, this kind of theory is not based on existing or even postulated physics, and
is therefore hard to test. The notions of ’higher vibrational level’ and ’astral plane’ are simply
devoid of a physical meaning.
In TGD framework the idea about ’vibrational levels’ generalizes in an astonishing concreteness
to an entire hierarchy of electromagnetic life forms and electromagnetic bodies whose sizes vary
to astronomical length scales [K28, K65] . In this framework the idea about brain as a seat
of consciousness is an illusion resulting from the fact that sensory data is mostly about the
immediate region around body. Of course, even the idea that consciousness (as opposed to its
information contents) can be localized to some part of space-time, is basically wrong in TGD
approach.
A possible test for the astral projection theories is a weighing of the body after death to deduce
the weight of the astral body (assuming of course that astral planes obey ordinary physics!).
If ’astral planes’ correspond to the p-adic space-time sheets, this test of course does not make
sense. Magnetic mirror structures are obvious candidates for astral body and are real but their
separation from body is impossible so that this kind of measurents do not make sense. The
notion of 4-D body also suggests that the physical body remain in the geometric past in the
physical death wherefrom it can communicate with the living ones via the magnetic mirrors of
magnetic body which continues to be generated by p-adic-to-real phase transition.
Extrasensory perception via astral bodies is a second possible test. This test might make sense
if extrasensory perception can be generated by patterns of ELF em ﬁelds as supposed in the
TGD inspired model of qualia. Magnetic mirrors connecting organisms to each other and also
to ’nonliving’ matter make possible ESPs.
Also direct electromagnetic perturbations of the

11.4. Parapsychological phenomena
591
magnetic sensory canvas can give rise to ESPs: in [K39] the possibility that the strange sounds
produced by meteors [F1] could correspond to ESPs is discussed.
4. Tunnel experience
The theory of Grof and Halifax [J69] is based on the observation that NDE involves elements
which might be assigned to the moment of birth. Perhaps NDE is reliving the moment of birth.
The counter argument is that the newly born baby does not see anything unless she is able to
perceive extrasensorily. ’Nothing but hallucinations’ theories are of course no explanations at
all and belong to the same category as ’consciousness as mere illusion’ theories. In neuroscience
framework also the wake-up reality is seen basically as a hallucination produced by brain and
coupled with sensory input to guarantee correspondence with what is out there.
The tunnel is experienced also during epilepsy and migraine, during meditation and relaxed state
of mind, and with certain drugs like LSD, philocybin and mescaline. I have also personal ’tunnel
experiences’ every-daily: when I close my eyes in a half-meditative state achieved by writing at
computer terminal, I can see a dim ﬂow consisting of points. Typically this ﬂow enters to or
emergences from a tunnel. It can be rotating spiral like ﬂow or simple sink or source. Source or
sink can be also linear structure. Earlier this experience was not stable and tends to fade away
all the time, and after few minutes I was not anymore able to achieve it. Situation has changed
quite recently: I can have the experience almost anytime in peaceful state of mind. During my
great experiences this ﬂow was much more complicated and completely visible and formed a
stable background of the ordinary visual experience and of hallucinatory visual images.
There is however no experience of entering into the tunnel in this case so that the tunnel need
not be the same as encountered in NDEs. It has been suggested that the physiology of brain
could explain the properties of near death experiences [J47] . The theory of Cowan [J47] states
that the tunnel results from a failure of the inhibition leading to brain induced activity yielding
visual experiences. What is however questionable is why person would feel falling into the tunnel,
to say nothing about meeting deceased relatives. Blackmore and Troschienko have proposed a
theory in which also the motion along tunnel could be understood as a visual illusion [J38] .
TGD based explanation for tunnel experience might be simply as a direct visual experience about
magnetic ﬂux tube structures resulting from the perturbation of the magnetic sensory canvas
outside body. Thus a genuine ESP would be in question. Magnetic ﬁeld obeys indeed same
basic equation as incompressible liquid ﬂow. Both retinas and pineal gland (’third eye’ literally
since it contains retinal pigments and serves as a genuine third eye in some species [K28] are
magnetic structures. The practically always present vortex in center (’third eye’ in my private
terminology) could correspond to the magnetic ﬂux tube structure emanating from the pineal
gland whereas the very dynamical ﬂow could correspond to the contribution of retinas. If the
magnetic mirrors are universal electromagnetic bridges connecting us to other living beings, in
particular to our friends and relatives, the meeting of the 4-D bodies of the deceased relatives
would happen at the level of ﬁelds.
The movement along the tunnel could correspond to the propagation of p-adic-to-real phase
transition along this kind of magnetic mirror structure transforming it from p-adic to real: thus
the tunnel would be created after the physical death. During lifetime these em bridges would
be p-adic and physical death be followed via the transformation of these bridges to real ones.
5. OBE aspect
Blackmore explains OBEs [J36] as resulting from the replacement of ordinary self-center expe-
rience of world with bird’s eye of view model where brain sees own body from above. Bird’s
eye of view is only a memory model so that extrasensory perceptions are predicted to be im-
possible during OBEs. There is however some evidence that patients can report very precise
visual perceptions during OBE. It has been indeed argued, that some other senses than vision,
namely [K61] [J36] , could create indirectly these perceptions. It is however diﬃcult for even the
most hardborn materialist to understand how a clinically dead person could be able to eﬀectively
see by hearing, since this feat is impossible for even completely healthy person.

592
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
The idea of Blackmore about bird’s eye of view is very attractive as such and can be interpreted in
TGD framework in quite diﬀerent manner. Cognitive maps based on the canonical identiﬁcation
map [K27] typically exterior to inside and vice versa. Thus both a p-adic map of the external
world realized inside brain and a p-adic map of body and its surrounding realized outside the
body are possible and would give models of the external world and self. The inside-to-exterior
map could provide a bird’s eye of view about body and its immediate surroundings.
Both exterior→interior and interior→exterior maps could contribute to the conscious experience
even under the normal wake-up consciousness and the exterior contribution would thus represent
genuinely extrasensory contribution to the conscious experience. When the ordinary sensory
input and volitional activity ceases as during NDE, the contribution of the model of external
world to the conscious experience becomes negligible. The ability to experience tunnel unstably
during relaxed wake-up consciousness with eyes closed is consistent with the interpretation that
these two components are competing. It is quite possible that during sleep the bird’s eye of view
component also dominates but that no memories about this period are generated for the simple
reason that the brain functions necessary for the generation of the memories are not active. My
own remembrances about the long depressive period after the great experience caused by the
extreme dullness of the normal wake-up consciousness suggest at least to me that these kind of
memories might make it too painful to continue the daily life.
The notion of magnetic sensory canvas implies that we actually see at ELF frequencies. Same
applies to other senses. This implies the possibility of experiences without any sensory input or
even without any neuronal activity. The needed ELF MEs acting as sensory projectors would
be generated in the dropping of ions from atomic space-time sheets to the magnetic ﬂux tubes
of magnetic body carrying ﬁeld strength .2 Gauss (Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld has nominal value .5
Gauss). If the ion drops in high n cyclotron state the subsequent decay of the state by cyclotron
transitions generates a bundle of parallel ELF MEs giving rise to the sensory projection. This
representation can be generated by the entire body and would give rise to a three-dimensional
vision about body as seen by the environment. There is some evidence for this kind of anomalous
vision.
(a) Yogis have reported altered states of consciousness in which they see their own body
three-dimensionally, that is simultaneously from all directions.
(b) Becker tells in his book ”Cross currents” [J29] about a young cancer patient who told that
he can see the interior of his own body. The patient could locate the calcium deposit left
as tumor vanished. This supports the view that ELF MEs could project from the entire
body to the sensory canvas.
(c) Also the OBE experiences, for instance those associated with NDEs, could have a similar
interpretation.
The sensory input from eyes and even the input from neural activity
could be absent during NDEs so that the visual experience should be determined by
the background ELF component emanating from the brain and body. The third person
perspective associated with OBEs might be always present but be masked by the strong
sensory input.
What has been said applies also to other senses. Interestingly, I often wake-up partially and
realize that I hear my own snoring as an outsider. Sometimes I have an experience which might
be interpreted by saying that the hearing in the ﬁrst perspective is superposed with the hearing
in the third person perspective. The third person hearing has a time lag so that a kind of double
breathing results.
Sensory canvas hypothesis provides a more concrete view about the situation. p-Adic-to-real
phase transition of a p-adic magnetic sensory canvas to real one could also be part of the
fundamental volitional process. The magnetic mirrors connecting brain to sensory canvas should
be there also in the absence of sensory input. Could it be that the out of body view is always
involved but masked by the from the body view and after the physical death only out of body
view remains?
The competition between bird’s eye of view and sensory view has also EEG correlate. Delta
waves in the EEG spectrum are natural EEG correlates for the external part of cognition. The

11.4. Parapsychological phenomena
593
reason is that this part of EEG frequency spectrum has a shape and intensity very similar to that
for the so called sferics [F3] , which correspond to meteorological electromagnetic perturbations
typically associated with thunder storms.
Could sferics be the electromagnetic correlates of
discarnates?! The degree of the sensory alertness correlates directly with the the ratio of the
EEG net intensities in the delta band and in higher EEG bands [F3] . This is consistent with the
competition predicted by NMP. Certainly in the NDE experiences studied by the Southampton
team only delta band is present in EEG. Note that delta waves dominate also during deep sleep.
Also alpha band is a good candidate for communicating sensory information to higher level selves
having magnetic sensory canvas receiving sensory input from several brains simultaneously. It is
indeed alpha band in which detectable changes occur in remote vision and remote healing [J120]
. Could it be that higher than alpha consciousness somehow transforms to alpha consciousness in
physical death and could it be that alpha consciousness relates with the fact the lowest Schumann
frequency associated with the perturbations of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld is in the alpha band? It
might be that magnetic transition frequencies are involved with the ’vertical’ communications
from brain to the sensory canvas whereas Schumann resonances would be involved with the
lateral communications between diﬀerent sensory canvases. The fact that hypnagogic experiences
involving also identiﬁcation with other persons (personal experience) appear in the borderline
between wake and sleep when dominating EEG frequencies are around 7.8 Hz supports this
view.
6. Life review
Blackmore explains the life review as an eﬀect analogous to the lively episodal memories gener-
ated by stimulating temporal lobes. This explanation leaves open what exactly happens in the
stimulation of the temporal lobes and what episodal memories are. To say nothing about the
systematic review and evaluation.
In TGD framework brain and perceptive ﬁeld are four-dimensional and it is quite possible that
episodal memories are multitime experiences involving input which comes from the moment of
the geometric time when the recalled experience happened and happens again at the level of
sensory representation but not as real life event since this would involve macroscopic volition
and induce miracle life events in the geometric future.
The notion of 4-D body makes this
idea concrete. In the physical death 4-D body becomes in some sense mature (about possible
de-construction processes in shorter time scales). The volitional contribution essential for the
illusion that world is 3-dimensional is not anymore present and entire 4-D body is experienced
as a whole. Perhaps this is just what life review is.
Since geometric memories are in question, the review is only a narrative since our geometric
past changes all the subjective time and the review is about geometric past subjectively now.
Life review would be a temporal counterpart of the OBE experience in the sense that one sees
one’s geometric life history from outside in a 4-dimensional sense. This is possible since p-adic
cognitive representations are four-dimensional and four-dimensional bird’s eye of view could
begin to dominate at the moment of death.
Also genuine subjective memories about time interval equal to the wake-up period of self and
of order lifetime could be in question. This requires the occurrence of what might be called
a p-adic phase transition to higher level self with much longer subjective memory: this view
is in accordance with the vision about the physical death as a birth to a life in ’other world’.
p-Adic phase transition could mean that the p-adic magnetic mirrors after the geometric time
after physical death correspond to higher value of p and quite concretely, have lengths which
are longer than during the physical life. This makes possible both geometric and subjective
memories in much longer time scale.
7. Positive emotions
With the motivation coming from the OBEs associated with the temporal-lobe epilepsy, it has
been suggested that brain-stress near NDE episode leads to the release of neuropeptides and
neurotransmitters (in particular endogenous endorphins) which are responsible for positive emo-
tional states like joy, peace, and love. Again the question concerns about the deeper mechanism.

594
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
Presumably these neurochemicals are only correlates for the experiences in which extra-sensory
component of the experience begins to dominate. It has been also suggested that the lack of
oxygen is what gives rise to the NDE experiences [J36] . The observations of the Southampton
team seem to exclude these explanations. Of course, one could claim that some core parts of
brain are working even when the patient is clinically dead (no respiration, no heart beat, dilated
pupils) and that these functioning parts of brain are able to generate NDE. If so, spiritual expe-
riences would represent the lowest possible levels of consciousness, and even reptiles would have
them: perhaps a vulgar skeptic could applaude here but I do not ﬁnd this idea very convincing.
In TGD framework clinical death naturally implies that extrasensory component of the conscious
experience begins to dominate. This picture is consistent with the view about brain as p-adic–
real transformer rather than the seat of the entire conscious experience. The dominance of the
positive emotions would simply mean that the negative emotions coming from sensory input
would be absent.
8. Other worlds
The experiencing of ’other worlds’ requires a considerable amount of hand weaving in the stan-
dard neuroscience framework. Blackmore claims that imagined worlds are experienced as real
because these experiences are the most stable. I believe that Blackmore is right in the sense that
mental images (sub-selves) correspond to self-organization patterns which are stable asymptotic
states of self-organization. I do not however believe that this is an essential point, and certainly
Blackmore’s explanation fails if the interpretation of the Southampton team about NDEs is
correct.
In TGD framework the other worlds might correspond to the emergence of magnetic mirror
structures which correspond to higher value of p-adic prime than during the physical life. They
would have much longer lengths and give rise to much longer subjective and geometric memories.
Note that the MEs associated with magnetic mirrors are classical representation for light (which
brings in mind Tibetan book of death!) so that one could say that the deceased becomes a
light being in a well-deﬁned sense. The meeting of the light being might mean an ability to
communicate with and sensorily experience the presence of other light beings, natural if the
deceased herself has transformed to a light being (but having still 4-D body in the geometric
past, this is perhaps why angels have human body!).
Note also that the absence of sensory and corresponding cognitive mental images during NDE
is analogous to the empty mind free of mental images which is the goal of the meditation
practices. Perhaps soul could be identiﬁed as a self having no subselves, ’irreducible self’ as
suggested in [K70] .
9. After eﬀects
The after eﬀects induced by the spatio-temporally extended consciousness in which one sees
one’s own life from outside are often dramatic. It is diﬃcult to reduce these after eﬀects to brain
pharmacology.
My own great experience had many aspects common to NDEs and induced profound (not at all
pleasant!) changes in my own life. In my case the direct experience of the higher levels of reality
made possible the realization how magniﬁcent the almost-boring everyday reality really is when
seen through sharpened senses, how pathetically narrow the zone of wake-up consciousness is,
and how ridiculously little the celebrated big science tells about reality. This realization resulted
in a strong conviction that I am on a right track, and has given the courage to work these ﬁfteen
years as a ridiculed scientiﬁc dissident in a country in which vulgar skepticism is in the role of
a scientiﬁc state religion and vulgar skeptics have taken the role of the mind police of science.
11.4.4
Are communications between living and deceased possible?
The vision about psychological time suggests that the life after the physical death could be purely
electromagnetic so that the memes and memeplexes represented by p-adic cognitive space-time
sheets (magnetic mirrors say) associated with the organism continue to transform to their real

11.4. Parapsychological phenomena
595
counterparts after the physical death. Since these magnetic mirrors can connect the 4-D body
of the deceased to living physical bodies, communications between deceased and living become
possible and the mechanism of communications is same as the mechanism of long term memories.
It is also possible that the transformation of the magnetic mirror structures to real form induce
generation of biological organisms around them and this would give rise to re-incarnation.
In the language used in the spiritistic circles, 4-D bodies of the deceased together with the
magnetic mirror structure associated with them also after the physical death would correspond
to ’discarnate’ or ’ethereal’ entities belonging to the ’etheric level’. Perhaps the proper inter-
pretation for p-adic space-time sheets representing thoughts and intentions is as not-yet-born
entities.
Since the p-adic copies of all real physical systems are possible, even the most far-fetched claims
of psychics about materialization and communication phenomena could in principle make sense.
It however seems that what is materialized by p-adic-to-real transition is the plan for organism
represented by magnetic ﬂux tube structures.
Mediums and materializations
In spiritualistic circles mediums have been traditionally seen to mediate communications between
deceased and alive. This includes also claimed materializations of physical objects besides the
bodies of the deceased. Often direct voices emerging from empty space are claimed to been heard
during the sittings: trumpets and accordions ﬂow in the air and produce music. Analogous direct
voice phenomena are associated with the claimed poltergeist phenomena. The explanation goes
that medium is able to somehow to draw ’ectoplasm’ from her (quite often her) own body and
from the bodies of the participants which then materializes as the bodies of deceased and as
material objects.
For a physicist this explanation is empty as long as a physical and mathematical deﬁnition of
the ectoplasm is lacking. In TGD frame work mediums could be seen as persons able to act as
relay stations communicating with both deceased and with the participants of the sitting via
magnetic mirror bridges. Perhaps these bridges are generated during sitting and medium helps
to transform them to real form so that communications along these bridges become possible.
The transformation of the p-adic space-time sheets to real ones is of course the natural candidate
for the materialization process.
Zero energy ontology allows also a direct generation of CD in quantum jump is in principle
possible and TGD inspired theory of consciousness support this possibility indirectely since the
generation of a mental image corresponds to generation of sub-CD and thus creation of zero
energy state from vacuum. In this framework ectoplasm would be ordinary biomatter.
My own great experience, which involved several parapsychological elements, was a parade of
deep ideas, and one of them was the notion ’ﬂogiston’ as something new for the existing physics
and absolutely essential for the living matter. According to the vision, living organisms were
ﬁghting and killing to get ’ﬂogiston’, and the greatest minds had been able to get it (even steal!)
more than the lesser souls. I have considered several identiﬁcation of this mysterious ’ﬂogiston’.
p-Adic space-time sheets is one possible identiﬁcation. Second interpretation as negentropic
entanglement possible in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and crucial for TGD inspired
view about metabolism.
One cannot exclude the possibility that the transformation of the p-adic plan for a material body
represented by magnetic mirror structures could induce a self-organization of the ordinary matter
around this template to form material objects or at least mimicries of them. This is essentially
what biological growth is assumed to be. The p-adic-real transitions in the intersection of real
and p-adic worlds would provide a concrete realization of this mimicry.
If is of course diﬃcult to take seriously materialization of entire physical objects by p-adic-to-real
transitions (the phenomenon would have enormous technological impact!). It would seem more
probable to me that memes transform directly to real space-time sheets causing what are usually
regarded as hallucinatory experiences, which is now however completely real communication.
If this can happen, it could happen also collectively so that all participants have the same

596
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
paranormal experience. This does not look strange if one accepts the possibility of magnetic
sensory canvases receiving sensory input from several brains and also inducing hallucinatory
perceptions.
Usually the spiritistics sittings have been held in the darkness and this allows excellent oppor-
tunities for a fraud. On the other hand, alpha band in EEG begins to dominate in darkness
and might make possible the communications. There are several reasons to think that it is fast
amplitude modulation of alpha frequencies producing harmonic multiples of the alpha frequency,
which could be the communication mechanism between our level and higher levels of self hier-
archy. The so called mesoscopic features appearing in EEG correlates and corresponding to 1-2
cm areas of cortex [E1] could be direct physical correlates for these communications [K65] . The
model of bicameral mind based on the notion of semitrance relies on the same idea [K71] . Note
that the minimization of the sensory input (sittings are arranged in dark room) might be just
what is needed for the extrasensory input to dominate.
EMDR method as a mechanism to communicate with deceased
Near-death experiences are not the only manner to get convinced about life after death. So
called eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) discovered by Francine Shapiro
[J40, J119] induces what could be interpreted as after-death communications. The experiences of
subject persons can be induced by this therapy in highly reliable manner: according to [J40] 98
per cent of patients willing to participate the therapy had after death communication experience
It does not matter what the religious convictions of the subject person are and the experiences
are actually rather easy to induce. It does not matter if the loss is traumatic or not or whether
it is recent or occurred for decades in past. The experiences resemble near death experiences
(light tunnels, beautiful landscapes) and involve spiritual contact with the deceased. The EMDR
technique involves getting the patient to move his or her eyes in a particular thythmic fashion
while at the same time attending to a particular aspect of the traumatic memory. How EMRD
works is poorly understood as yet: possibly the fact that the shifting of eyes leads to increased
brain processing is of importance. Notice that rapid eye movements REM are also involved with
dreams.
A possible explanation is that EMDR experiences could involve communication with the 4-D
bodies of the deceased ones located possibly in the geometric recent or past via the magnetic
mirrors associated with them. One might think that rapid thythmic eye movements induce fast
modulations of some alpha frequency and generate the above mentioned features which somehow
help to get a contact with deceased, perhaps rhythmic eye movements somehow induce the p-
adic-to-real transition of the p-adic magnetic mirror bridges. Essentially the same mechanism
as involved with long term episodal memories would be in question: the only diﬀerence would
be that the magnetic mirrors now mediate information not from own 4-D body from the 4-D
body of the deceased.
11.5
TGD based model for instrumental transcommunica-
tions
11.5.1
Introduction
The so called instrumental transcommunications (ITC) and electronic voice phenomena (EVP)
[J51, J113] belong to the borderline of even paranormal phenomena, and skeptically oriented
scientists probably ﬁnd it rather diﬃcult to take the claimed phenomena seriously. Personally I
do not have any strong opinions and I am just interested in ﬁnding whether TGD view about
paranormal phenomena might allow the claimed phenomena. Quite generally, ITC can be de-
ﬁned as messages communicated by some conscious entities other than humans using various
kinds of electronic instruments. Electronic voices (EVP) are only a special case of the claimed
communications and can be realized as signals appearing in a magnetic tape, as voices heard di-
rectly from radio receivers, or even phone calls from dead. Also images appearing in a computer

11.5. TGD based model for instrumental transcommunications
597
screen are reported. The article of Ralf Determayer in the ITC journal [J51] , whose chief editor
Anabela Cardoso is also ITC experimenter, helps to get an overview about the ITC phenomena.
Friedrich Jurgenson is usually mentioned as the pioneer or EVP. In 1959 Jurgenson recorded bird
song in the morning to a tape recorder and to his surprise found that the tape contained also
something else. He started a systematic research of the voices which he interpreted as messages
from deceased.
This work materialized in two books, ”Voices from Space” and ”Radio-link
with the Dead”. Kostantin Raudive, professor of philosophy and psychology and a student of
Carl Jung met Jurgenson in 1965, got interested in the phenomenon, and started an intensive
recording and study. He published his results in book ”Breakthrough” [J113] . As a matter
fact, Jurgenson and Raudive had predecessors, Raymond Bayless, Attila Szalay published 1959
an article about the phenomenon in Journal of the American Society of Psychical Research, few
months before Jurgensen made is discovery. Later begun experimenting also with other forms
of EVP and ITC [J51] . EVP involves recorded phone calls from deceased, direct radio voices,
voices both heard by experimenter and tape recorded, and ”paranormal” voices not heard but
recorded. ITC involves also also other communication modes such as receival of images via
computer screen. If one takes seriously all these reports, it would seem that both analog and
digital communications are involved.
EVP and ITC very brieﬂy
My own knowledge abut EVP and ITC is very restricted. According to the articles published
in ITC journal, for instance the articles [J51, J109, J108] there seems to be a consensus about
the following aspects of ITC.
(a) The role of the experimenter is important.
The ability to receive messages is learned
only gradually. The receiving system which works for one experimenter does not work for
another. For instance, if two radios are used simultaneously they usually work at diﬀerent
frequencies. This all suggests that experimenter serves as a kind of medium, relay station,
or ”radio link”.
(b) The naive idea about spirits serving as radio stations is not probably correct [J109, J108]
. The voices from radio receivers tend to be located in silent periods containing only the
background noise and somehow the sender is able to use the energy of the noise to generate
the message. This suggests that stochastic resonance in which a weak signal is ampliﬁed
using noise to provide the energy might be involved. The transformation of noise to voice
raises the question about the possible breaking of the second law of thermodynamics, and
TGD indeed allows breaking of second law below p-adic time scales [K35] .
(c) The spectral analysis of the electronic voices by Paolo Presi [J108] shows that usually the
voices have an acoustical structure similar to that of human voices. The temporal sequence
of vowels, their duration, the duration of the pauses, and the accent of certain vowels of
the voices determine a speech thythm similar to ours. The transfer of information is based
exclusively on the sequence of the vowel formants and the integration, made by listener,
of the missing consonants. Consonants are produced by a sudden interruption of the air
ﬂow coming from the lugns or by an obstruction of the vocal tract. The spectrograms
contain no fundamental frequency [J109, J108] unlike speech for which the fundamental
frequency deﬁnes the pitch. In principle this does not mean a loss of information but
together with the absence of the consonants would mean that the primary source of the
message is probably not speech organs. This makes hoax as an explanation of the voices
less plausible.
Questions
There are several questions to be answered. 1. How could one tell whether the ITC messages
are real or not?

598
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
Brain tries to generate standard percepts from sensory inputs: by looking at clouds at the
sky one realizes that brain almost inevitably tends to see faces or other patterns. Therefore
this question is highly non-trivial. One can try to answer the question by analyzing whether
(say) the electronic voices have spectra resembling that of human voices, and carry the minimum
information to be recognized as a speech. It is relatively easy to distinguish an artifact produced
by an intelligent life-form (say quartz clock) from a ”dead” matter (say a piece of rock). In
the similar manner, the diﬀerences between the electronic voices and ”dead sounds” provide a
criterion for whether they are produced intentionally. The information content of the signal is
an obvious criterion for this but it is far from trivial, how to deﬁne and measure the information
content.
Standard real-number based statistical physics allows only the notion of entropy. Entropy is
always non-negative so that the information deﬁned as negentropy would be non-positive always:
the best one can achieve would be to know nothing!
TGD inspired theory of consciousness
strongly encourages a number theoretic modiﬁcation of the standard notion of information,
which is based on Shannon’s deﬁnition of entropy [K44] . The resulting p-adic entropies (one
for each prime p) obey the same axioms as the Shannon’s entropy but can have both positive
and negative values, and depending on the sign can be interpreted as measures of either dis-
information or information. These information measures might apply to the analysis of EVP
messages. The conclusion of Paolo Presi [J109, J108] on basis of his analysis is that the voices
represent a real attempt to communicate.
In the following I will assume the messages are
real and look whether TGD based view about remote mental interactions allows to model the
phenomenon.
2. What could we speculate about the senders of the messages?
In TGD Universe everything is conscious and consciousness can be only lost by quantum en-
tangling. Thus everything is living, and the question is only about how eﬀectively system can
control its own state and the state of its environment and about the time scale of the control.
(a) Ordinary humans could send these messages unconsciously: human brain and body act
as both receiving and sending electromagnetic antennae and in view of the topological
quantization of classical em ﬁeld, it would not be too surprising if these electromagnetic
messages could be received electronically under some conditions.
(b) TGD predicts that our electromagnetic bodies will survive so that the conscious experience
of a discarnate receives a contribution from the 4-dimensional body of the deceased (life
review reported in near death experiences) plus a contribution from electromagnetic body
still existing.
(c) Also the magnetosphere is predicted to be a conscious entity containing collective multi-
brained selves.
(d) The model for crop formations [K18, K19] leads to rather detailed ideas about exotic life-
forms residing at various boundary layers of the magnetosphere, where energy currents
driving self-organization are strong. In particular, the mantle-core and core-inner core
boundary layers are good candidates for the seats of lifeforms (intra-terrestrials, ITs)
quantum-controlling the liquid and/or liquid-crystal phases of quartz or iron from very
cold and super-conducting space-time sheets.
3. What is the communication mechanism? TGD based model of remote mental interactions
is based on same mechanism as communications inside biological organisms. The mechanism
involves quantum entanglement having low frequency MEs (massless extremals, ”topological
light rays”) as a space-time correlate, and remotely induced self-organization based on high
frequency MEs propagating along low frequency MEs like mass-less particles. If magnetic mirrors
act as bridges between the deceased and the experimenter and between the experimenter and the
electronic instrument so that the experimenter takes the role of a relay station (or medium), the
phenomenon ceases to look totally implausible. Long term memory, telepathy, remote healing,...,

11.5. TGD based model for instrumental transcommunications
599
and communications with exotic life-forms and deceased become special cases of the same general
phenomenon. For instance, TGD predicts mechanisms for how body and brain seem can act as
lasers in wavelength range extending from ELF range to visible and UV wavelengths. This kind
of laser action could amplify the incoming signal, say microwaves at GHz region, which could
the be detected in turn by the electronic instrument with which the experimenter has quantum
entanglement bridges, and then transformed to sounds.
4. How the sender can handle modern information technology to generate the desired messages?
In case of a tape recorder or telephone the electric signal is only em variant of sound wave but
in case of radio situation changes. The carrier frequency of the sound changes and amplitude
modulation can be replaced with frequency modulation. If signal is to be transformed to visual
images, a transformation to binary code is needed. The question is where this technological
knowhow comes? There are two possibilities.
(a) A feedback from the electronic instrument via the brain of experimenter listening say the
magnetotape and thus trial-and-error learning of how to send desired messages becomes
possible.
The simplest feedback is based on the sharing of the mental images of the
experimenter by quantum telepathy. TGD allows also history editing, which means that
the message to the instrument in the geometric past is modiﬁed again and again so that a
repeated listening of the message could make it more comprehensible.
(b) The existing knowledge about remote mental interaction suggests that they often involve
magnetospheric multi-brained selves acting as kind of relay stations. For instance, remote
viewer knows only the coordinates of the target, which as such are completely meaningless
numbers to her: it is enough that the person who gave the coordinates of the target to the
viewer knows their meaning. If ITC occurs in this manner, the information about how to
translate the message to say bit sequences in the computer memory might be available. A
direct remote mental interaction with the electronic system might be involved at least in
some cases and the question is how the proposed general scenario allows to realize this.
5. How the intention of the sender is realized as action?
Remote mental interactions involve also the transformation of intention to action.
In TGD
framework this corresponds to p-adic-to-real transformation for some space-time sheets. Natural
candidates are systems for which the energy of the resulting real system is small so that external
energy feed can provide it. If the primary message comes from the magnetic body of the deceased,
p-adic MEs are perhaps the most natural candidates for the representations of intentions. These
p-adic MEs must ﬁrst be transformed to real MEs; the real MEs interact with the magnetospheric
self; the real MEs originating from the magnetosphere interact with the brain and/or body of
experimenter, which in turn interacts with the receiving instrument.
Detailed models for the transformation of the p-adic ME to a basic signal (represented by light
or sound) or directly to an electric signal (say in magnetic tape recorder) are not possible at this
stage. The mere occurrence of this transformation involves an active volition, and here the role
of the experimenter who believes and wants that the transformation occurs, might be decisive.
If this is the case, the phenomenon might be also regarded as a particular form of psychokinesis
and disappear if the experimenter has a skeptic attitude. Also feedback via the brain of the
experimenter to the sender is required and is strongest when the experimenter listens or sees
whether the message is there and possibly recognizes it.
11.5.2
Universe as a conscious hologram and a general mechanism
remote mental interactions
The idea about brain and perhaps all bio-matter, and even Universe, as a hologram in some
sense (see for instance, the articles of Miller and Webb [J89] and of Gariaev et al [I17] ) has a long

600
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
history but the question in which precise physical sense this holds true has remained without
a satisfactory answer. The notion of conscious hologram provided by TGD approach allows
to understand bio-control and remote mental interactions as particular cases of the same basic
interaction. The notion of conscious hologram leads also naturally to the notions of magnetic
body and magnetospheric sensory representations.
The general model of remote mental interactions
The mechanism of remote mental interaction involves two parts. The entanglement, which made
possible by low frequency ME in even astrophysical length scales, means that sender and receiver
of the message become eﬀectively a single system. This is enough to explain remote viewing as
sharing of mental images implied by the fusion of mental images of viewer and target system.
The active remote realization of intention requires high frequency MEs propagating like mass-
less particles along the low frequency ME and inducing the leakage of the supra currents from
larger to smaller space-time sheets, dissipation and possibly also amplifying laser action. This
mechanism works also in ordinary bio-control: remote mental interaction is now between some
biostructures such as cells or organs.
The scaling law of homeopathy, stating that high and low frequency MEs accompany each other
and the frequencies are in some ﬁxed proportions, plus p-adic length scale hypothesis make
the hypothesis highly predictive. There is no need to emphasize that the reduction of both
homeostasis and remote mental interaction to the same basic mechanism gives support for the
reality of the remote mental interactions.
The notion of conscious hologram
The concrete Maxwellian idea about hologram plate resulting as a result of interference of the
reference beam and light scattered from an object can serve only as a guiding metaphor. First
of all, coherence occurs only in what are called coherence regions and the problem is that
Maxwellian theory does not really provide a ﬁrst principle deﬁnition for the coherence regions.
In quantum theory similar problem is encountered. Secondly, in living matter it is not at all
clear whether reference beam exists at all. Third, living matter is a dynamic granular structure
and far from a homogeneous hologram plate. Fourth, the idea about storing memories, one of
the basic motivations of the hologram paradigm, has its own problems although multi-holograms
are certainly possible.
In TGD framework topological quantization provides a precise ﬁrst principle description of co-
herence. Topological ﬁeld quanta are the coherence regions of the classical ﬁeld and classical
decoherence means the splitting of the space-time surface to topological quanta. This process
gives rise to the granular structure of matter and space-time sheets in various length scales are
excellent candidates for basic units of hologrammic structures at the this level of the p-adic
length scale hierarchy. At quantum level bound state quantum entanglement having join along
boundaries bonds as a space-time correlate is responsible for the macroscopic and macrotemporal
quantum coherence. The notion of conscious hologram combines two dual aspects of conscious-
ness to single concept: macrotemporal quantum coherence due to the generation of bound state
entanglement and giving rise to co-operation on one hand, and the dissipative self-organization
giving rise to Darwinian selection and competition on the other hand. In nutshell, the notion of
conscious hologram follows from the topological ﬁeld quantization.
(a) Classical ﬁelds and matter form a Feynmann diagram like structure consisting of lines rep-
resenting matter (say charged particles) and bosons (say photons). The matter lines are re-
placed by space-time sheets representing matter (elementary particles, atoms, molecules,...),
and virtual bosons are replaced by topological light rays (”mass-less extremals”, MEs).
Also magnetic ﬂux tubes appear and together with MEs they serve as correlates for bound
state quantum entanglement.
(b) The classical ﬁelds associated with MEs interfere only at the nodes, where they meet,
and one has a hologram like structure with nodes interpreted as the points of a hologram.

11.5. TGD based model for instrumental transcommunications
601
Thus one avoids the loss of information caused by the interference of all signals everywhere.
This aspect is crucial for understanding the role of em ﬁelds in living matter and brain.
The MEs corresponding to ’real photons’ are like laser beams entering the hologram and
possibly reﬂected from it.
What is new that the nodes can be connected by ’virtual
photon’ MEs also analogous to laser beams.
Hence also ’self-holograms’ with no laser
beam from external world are possible (brain without sensory input). The hologram has a
fractal structure: there are space-time sheets at space-time sheets and high frequency MEs
propagating eﬀectively as mass-less particles inside low frequency MEs serving as quantum
entangling bridges of even astrophysical length.
(c) The particle like high frequency MEs induce ’bridges’ between magnetic ﬂux tubes and
atomic space-time sheets at the receiving end. This makes possible the leakage of supra
currents from magnetic ﬂux tubes to atomic space-time sheets analogous to the exposure of
ﬁlm producing hologram. The leakage induces dissipation, self-organization, and primitive
metabolism as a cyclic ﬂow of ionic currents between the two space-time sheets, and
thus a Darwinian selection of the self-organization patterns results. The low frequency
MEs are responsible for the bound state entanglement, macroscopic quantum coherence
and co-operation whereas high frequency MEs are responsible for self-organization and
competition.
(d) Also the notion of laser action ﬁnds its place: many-sheeted space-time provides natural
mechanism of laser interaction: when the system is irradiated with coherent light with
a frequency which corresponds to the energy diﬀerence for the ions at the space-sheets
corresponding to diﬀerent p-adic primes, induced dropping of the ions to a larger space-
time sheet occurs and implies a stimulated emission. Thus the light beam can be ampliﬁed.
(e) At the level of conscious experience the fusion of subselves gives rise to a fusion of mental
images. In case of right and left visual ﬁelds this fusion gives rise to stereovision analogous
to what results in hologram. In the general case kind of stereo consciousness results if the
mental images are suﬃciently similar.
Magnetic sensory canvas hypothesis
The magnetic sensory canvas hypothesis is perhaps the most radical hypothesis of TGD inspired
theory of consciousness. It states that sensory representations are realized outside brain at mag-
netic ﬂux tube structures associated with brain and have sizes measured perhaps in the size scale
of Earth. The realization is based on the same mechanism as remote mental interactions: the
simple feeling of existence mental images fuses with the more complex mental images produced
in brain.
Possible extra-sensory perceptions induced by atmospheric phenomena might provide support
for this hypothesis.
Auroras are known to induce sounds not detected by electronic means:
could these be extrasensory perceptions induces by auroras on sensory canvas. Also meteors
could induce sounds [F1] . If one takes very seriously the model for sensory representations, one
can imagine that the meteors could kick electromagnetically the magnetic ﬂux tube-ME pairs
of sensory canvas and force them to resonantly oscillate at harmonics of the thalamocortical
resonance frequencies in interval 37-44 Hz.
These magnetic mirrors might also mediate the electric perturbations to Earth in a channelled
manner so that no attenuation would be involved. The mirrors could mediate un-attenuated or
even ampliﬁed ELF waves also also to electronic instruments. And what is of special interest
now, if electronic instruments couple to the magnetic sensory canvas, machine-man interactions
would become possible. The test is to look whether meteors induce sounds heard without time
lag due to ﬁnite propagation velocity of sound and whether also electronic instruments detect
these sounds.
Amazingly, there is evidence just for this kind of strange eﬀects. For centuries it is known that
meteors can generate audible ’pop’ like sound. Sound is heard instantaneously so that either we
hear it as ESP through magnetic sensory canvas or ELF em waves are transformed to sounds
at Earth and heard after that. Quite recently also electronic instruments have detected these

602
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
sound [F1] . Amazingly, the frequencies were 37-44 Hz range contrary to the expectation that
they would be in the range 20-20.000 Hz and have much weaker intensity. The generation of
sounds with the observed intensity is theoretically possible only if the electric perturbations
from ionosphere have propagated to Earth as essentially unattenuated (along magnetic mirrors)
or being even selectively ampliﬁed (magnetic mirrors as wave cavities).
Thus there is some support, not only for the sensory canvas hypothesis, but also for the machine-
mind interactions at thalamocortical resonance frequencies. One could also look whether there
are correlations between human EEG and electromagnetic perturbations of electromagnetic in-
struments in thalamocortical frequency range (and perhaps also at the higher harmonics of it).
This interaction might be of fundamental technological important since it might make possible
to control electronic instruments directly by thought.
11.5.3
Who are the senders?
In TGD Universe everything is conscious and consciousness can be only lost. Therefore it is
possible to imagine several kinds of senders.
Deceased and/or living humans?
In some messages the senders tell that they are deceased. There are two possibilities: either the
senders live in the geometric now in some other than the usual physical form or they live in the
geometric past where their physical body still exists. Both options seem to be possible.
(a) The conservation of magnetic ﬂux suggests that the magnetic ﬂux tube structure associated
with the electromagnetic body survives the physical death so that both the 4-dimensional
physical body of the deceased in the geometric past and also electromagnetic body in
geometric present would exist.
If the p-adic MES associated with the electromagnetic
body continue to transform from p-adic to real form, electromagnetic bridges between the
4-D body of the deceased and physically living creatures or electronic instruments could
make possible ITC.
(b) Also the entanglement with and signals from the geometric past from the physical bod-
ies of the deceased must be considered (say the communications by Kostantin Raudive).
TGD based model of long term memories (all memories, even water memory) is based on
the mirror idea: when I remember I look at me at a magnetic mirror located at a huge
distance of light years. Therefore I see the me of the geometric past in the mirror [K66] .
Magnetic mirrors can however connect me to some other person and this means communi-
cations with the persons having 4-D body in the geometric past, receiving their memories.
This communication is more probable between persons have had (and still have) a close
relationship generating the required magnetic mirror bonds.
(c) Also the brains and bodies of living could act as sending antennae and generate uncon-
siously ITC messages.
Thus one cannot expect that all messages would have a deep
spiritual tone.
Magnetospheric selves?
The model for the sensory representations realized at magnetic bodies of astrophysical size
inspires the hypothesis that also the magnetosphere of Earth acts as sensory magnetic canvas
and is a living, conscious system. Magnetosphere could be a seat for multi-brained conscious
entities receiving information from human and other brains and bodies serving as neurons of
these life-forms. Various EEG frequencies correlate for various parts of the magnetosphere by
resonance conditions. Especially interesting seats for em life-forms are various boundary layers of
the magnetosphere, such as the plasma sheet at the night side magnetosphere and magnetopause
serving also as a kind of magneto-immune system.

11.5. TGD based model for instrumental transcommunications
603
Remote mental interactions such as remote viewing involve aspects which suggests that they
proceed via the mediary of multi-brained selves providing information necessary for the local-
ization of the target not possessed by the remote viewer herself. Also ITC might involve these
collective levels of consciousness. Empirical support for the notion of multi-brained collective
levels of consciousness comes from the experiments of Mark Germine [J66] .
An operator and a subject person were involved. The stimulation of the subject person consisted
of a sequence of identical sounds containing now and then an odd-ball stimulus (now silence).
The odd-ball stimulus generated an event related potential (ERP) visible in EEG and reﬂecting
the conscious reaction. The operator was in a second room and by simple toss of coin decided
whether to observe the stimuli in the computer monitor or not. The stimuli appeard in the
computer monitor one second before they were heard by the subject person. What was found
that when the operator saw the odd ball stimulus from the computer monitor, the ERP was
weaker on the average. An 11 Hz periodicity was the major component in the diﬀerence proﬁles.
The simplest explanation is that the brains of both the operator and of the subject person belong
to a larger multi-brained self and that the evoked response represented partially the reaction
of this self. When this multi-brained self had already seen the stimulus through the operator’s
eyes, it was not so surprised to hear this stimulus again through the ears of the subject person,
and ERP was weaker. The appearance of the 11 Hz periodicity suggests that this frequency is
an important correlate for the entanglement of the subject person’s mental images with those
of the multi-brained magnetospheric self.
ETs and/or ITs?
The interior of Earth contains almost empty and cold space-time sheets and the magnetic ﬂux
tube structure in the core of Earth serves as a kind of thalamus like relay station. The cavity
resonance frequencies associated with core and inner core are in the range 14-15 Hz and 40-50
Hz and correspond to two important frequencies of EEG. Thus also the interior of Earth might
be important for consciousness.
The general TGD based view about life implies that various boundary layers containing strong
energy currents driving self-organization are optimal for the emergence of life.
The mantle-
core and core-inner core boundary layers containing possibly liquid-crystal phases of quartz
(glass) and iron, are especially interesting seats for life-forms controlling the hot liquid-crystal
phase from larger space-time sheets which are very cold and super-conducting. A support for
these speculations comes from the strange ﬁndings associated with crop circles. In particular,
Chilbolton and Crabwood crop formations [H1, H2] can be interpreted as messages providing
information about these life forms: even the genetic codes of these life-forms can be deduced
and a general model for our genetic code emerges as a by-product [K18, K19] . One cannot
exclude a quantum symbiosis between us and these life-forms based on a telepathic sharing of
mental images, and this kind of symbiosis conforms with shamanistic and religious mythologies
and the Freudian super-ego-ego-id trinity. Therefore one must consider the possibility that the
senders of ITCs are ITs (intraterrestrials). Of course, quantum entanglement mechanism allows
also ETs as the senders of the messages.
11.5.4
Knowhow problem
How it is possible to code the information sent by the discarnate entity to say computer picture.
It is diﬃcult to imagine that the sender would be able to same as a group of IT specialists and
computer engineers. There are two manners to overcome this problem.
Higher level multibrained selves acting as relay stations
Higher level multi-brained magnetospheric selves could act as relay stations entangling the sender
of the message with the experimenter in turn entangled with the electronic instrument. The
knowhow about how to encode the primary signal to various forms such as AM or FM modulated

604
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
radiowave or even signal represented as a binary code could be possessed by some brains of this
higher level self.
The role of these selves would be same as in the proposed realization of memes and morphic
resonances of Sheldrake in terms of magnetic bodies responsible for collective consciousness [K69]
. The possibility of collective gene expression based on hyper genes would make this kind of
mechanism possible in the case of biological matter and would provide completely standardized
communication and control tools for magnetic bodies.
Feedback and history editing
The proposed model is consistent with the fact that EVP and ITC skills develop only gradually
and require patience and that some persons are more gifted than others. The generation of
the magnetic mirror bridges between senders and experimenter and experimenter and electronic
instrument require time. Also the sender must learn by feedback how to code desired messages
to the electronic instrument. The simplest form of feedback is a sharing of the mental images
generated by say the listening of the magnetic tape in the experimenter’s brain.
History editing provides quite a science ﬁctive sounding manner to make corrections to the
message. Each quantum history changes the geometric past so that history editing becomes
possible in principle. There is an experiment in which a chicken conﬁned to move in small area
became imprinted to a robot [J97] . The motion of the robot was coded to a random number
sequence half year before. After the imprinting the motion the robot tended to stay near the
chicken which suggests that the bleak chicken was able to alter the random number sequence
and thus edit history in a time scale of half year. Our long term memories are unstable and
can be altered by suggestions. In TGD framework also this can be regarded as history editing
applied to the sensory representations of the brain of the geometric past.
During the listening period the sender of the message could receive the information about the
conscious experience of the experimenter by the sharing of the mental images induced by the
message. The sender could make a quantum jump to a new history which would imply a mod-
iﬁcation the message to the electronic instrument located in the geometric past (the geometric
past changes in each quantum jump in TGD framework), the experimenter would perceive the
improved message, and so on. This iterative loop would lead ﬁnally to a message which generates
the experience of recognition of message in the receiver. During repeated sessions sender would
learn the code and would be able to send messages more easily.
11.5.5
Experimenter as a medium and ampliﬁer of the signal
Experimenter could act as receiver of the ITC signal, amplify it, and send it further to the
receiving instrument. Experimenter might also make possible feedback from the instrument to
the sender. Both various experimental ﬁndings and TGD based view about bio-systems lend
support for this hypothesis.
Magnetic mirror as electromagnetic bridge
The experimenter in ITC seems to play a role similar to that of the medium in spiritistic
sittings. The idea about experimenter as a relay station between electronic instrument, making
possible both the sending of the classical message to the instrument, and receiving the conscious
response of the receiver during the reading/listening session, might indeed help to understand
ITC at general level.
Magnetic mirrors are by deﬁnition magnetic ﬂux tubes accompanied by MEs parallel to them.
The Alfwen waves, which represent oscillations of magnetic ﬂux tube analogous to those of violin
string, resonate with the classical em wave propagating along ME and amplify the signal. To
be precise, one should speak about a mirror pair: the mirrors are the points of magnetic ﬂux
tube where ME is attached to the ﬂux tube. The existence of magnetic mirror bridges between
experimenter and electronic instrument would not be surprising. MEs and magnetic ﬂux tubes

11.5. TGD based model for instrumental transcommunications
605
represent topological ﬁeld quanta of electromagnetic ﬁeld and it would be more surprising if
they would not interact with electronic instruments since these instruments interact already in
Maxwell theory with external electromagnetic ﬁelds. What is new is that MEs make possible
channelled transfer of energy and information: in Maxwell’s theory signals would be transmitted
to all directions as ’mass communications’ and distance would be the limiting factor unlike in
case of MEs. The presence of kind of interaction would suggest that humans and electronic
instruments are already now in an intense interaction and that the electronic revolution is more
like a symbiotic process in which both machines and men are active participants.
The generation of electronic (and also acoustic) signal requires energy. Magnetic mirror quan-
tum entangles the discarnate, experimenter, and the electronic instrument. Only bound state
entanglement is preserved in quantum jump and thus binding energy is liberated when bound
state entanglement is generated. This energy is usable energy and could provide the energy
needed to generate the signal. If stochastic resonance is involved, the noise acts as an ampliﬁer
of the signal. In the case of an acoustic signal the body of the experimenter could generate the
sound and energy could come from metabolism.
Body and brain as antennae
TGD based view about living systems indeed predicts that brain and body act as receiving
and sending quantum antennae in a very wide range of frequencies. For instance, EEG can be
regarded as radiation emitted by brain acting as an antenna. TGD predicts that EEG MEs
are accompanied by high frequency MEs, most probably at microwave frequencies and induces
self-organization at magnetic body and thus give rise to sensory representations. For instance,
microwave hearing [I23] lends support for the hypothesis that brain is a receiving microwave
antenna. The microwave frequency spectrum relevant for microwave audition is in the range
.2 −3 GHz. A receiving antenna can also act as sending antenna and it is known that at the
sunset a microwave static of unknown but presumably biological origin emerges and correlates
strongly with the so called taos hum [I36] . Taos hum is a humming sound heard during night
time, which can become intolerable and has no identiﬁed origin. The most plausible explanation
of taos hum is as a special case of the microwave hearing.
Are alpha waves in special role?
The general communication mechanism between the sender and experimenter could be based
on fast amplitude modulation of alpha waves involving higher harmonics of ∼10 Hz wave (this
is like adding small riples in long wavelength water wave). This mechanism could in fact be
equivalent with the propagation of higher frequency MEs inside
10 Hz ME serving as the
quantum entangler.
(a) Schumann resonance frequencies correspond to cavity resonances in size scale of Earth
and thus might mediate telepathic communications between diﬀerent selves. The lowest
Schumann frequency of about 7.8 Hz is especially interesting in this respect.
(b) It seems that the 10 Hz fundamental frequency assignable to electron’s CD provides a ﬁrst
principle explanation for this frequency appearing also as fundamental biorhythm. This
also explains harmonics of 10 Hz frequency naturally. The hierarchy of Planck constants
allows also sub-harmonics and even rational multiples of 10 Hz frequency and one can ask
whether 5 Hz theta frequency corresponds to dark electrons.
(c) Originally the 10 Hz frequency emerged from the memetic code but zero energy ontology
provides a ﬁrst principle justiﬁcation for it. One realization of memetic code would be in
terms of 7 quark-like CDs of duration 1/1.28 ms with bits represented as states of quark
and 7:th bit representing a check bit. Genetic code could be realized in terms of 6 scaled
down variants of electronic CD but it is not clear whether this requires that quarks appear
with masses coming as half octaves of the basic p-adic mass scale corresponding to 5 MeV
mass scale. Memetic code could act as universal code making possible communications

606
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
also with ”dead” matter. One can even consider the possibility that electron possesses
primitive intelligence. The success of p-adic mass calculations could be indeed understood
if elementary particles reside in the intersection of real and p-adic worlds and are therefore
quite generally able to entangle negentropically.
Our speech uses the same mechanism (10 Hz frequency is the basic vibration frequency of speech
organs, which is not the fundamental frequency which is above 20 Hz) and so called features [E1]
identiﬁed in EEG patterns can be also regarded as a fast amplitude modulation of the alpha
wave (low amplitude higher harmonics of the alpha wave appear as ripples of the alpha wave).
This suggests that speech is an expression of genetic or perhaps even memetic code (the number
of codewords seems to be however enormous and genetic code seems to be quite enough.
The structure of the mesoscopic features of EEG [E1] suggests that the harmonics up to the 8:th
harmonic of alpha wave are present in EEG. This amplitude could modulate a carrier wave which
should have frequency above 80 Hz: the presence of the carrier wave is however not absolutely
necessary (the fundamental frequency deﬁning the pitch of the voice and produced by speech
organs indeed tends to be absent in EVP [J108] ). Interestingly enough, the frequency interval
for so called taos hum is in in the interval 40-80 Hz [K65] . The duration of nerve pulse is
consistend with the assumption that entire memetic code is realized at the level of nerve pulse
patterns.
These features could communicate information to higher level multibrained selves. It has been
found, that healer’s alpha wave activity intensiﬁes during healing process and magnetic emis-
sions in ELF range have been observed. Also correlations and synchronization between alpha
wave activities of Qigong masters and healees has been reported [J120] . If the brain of the
experimenter serves as a relay station, the deceased (identiﬁable as the electrommagnetic body
remaining after the physical death or as the physical body in the geometric past) could use
the same code as it has used while controlling its own material body from magnetic sensory
canvas during life time to both send and receive mental images. If magnetic sensory canvas is
able to produce visual hallucinations and dreams it might be also able to produce visual images
by sending similar commands to the brain of the experimenter serving as a relay station and
preserving the topological structure of images.
Could the body and brain act as lasers?
According to the experimental ﬁndings of Peter Gariaev and his group, the irradiation of DNA
by visible laser light induces radiowave emission at frequencies ranging from ELF frequencies
to MHz range [I17] . The TGD based model of the phenomenon relies on the hypothesis brain
and body could act as a laser in a wide range of frequencies extending from EEG frequencies
up to UV. The idea is simple: when an ion drops from a smaller to a larger space-time sheet it
liberates the diﬀerence for the energies of the initial and ﬁnal state. For free ions this energy is in
the simplest situation essentially the diﬀerence of zero point kinetic energies. For magnetic ﬂux
tubes it is the diﬀerence of magnetic energies, which is very small and can correspond to even
ELF frequencies. This leads to a many-sheeted laser mechanism: if the system is irradiated with
a radiation, whose frequency is same as for the radiation liberated in the dropping, stimulated
emission occurs and incoming coherent radiation can be ampliﬁed. The diﬀerence with respect to
the ordinary laser is that the ions does not drop from a higher to a lower energy state of an atom
but from a smaller to a larger space-time sheet. The many-sheeted laser could make possible for
a body and/or brains to amplify the incoming ITC signal represented by high frequency MEs
propagating along low frequency MEs generating the entanglement.
11.5.6
Could stochastic resonance be involved with ITC?
EVP research support the view that certain background noise is necessary for receiving messages.
Skeptic would of course argue that the noise provides the source from which brain as a builder
of familiar patterns constructs the signal.
On basis of this observation it has been however
proposed that stochastic resonance (the article [D6] is an excellent review about the principles

11.5. TGD based model for instrumental transcommunications
607
and applications of the stochastic resonance) is the mechanism of EVP. Stochastic resonance
requires a bistable system (for instance, double potential well) or an excitable system having
metastable states. An essentially nonlinear phenomenon is in question.
Stochastic resonance
Stochastic resonance works if the message to be ampliﬁed is represented as an amplitude mod-
ulation of a carrier wave with a basic frequency f and serves as a harmonic perturbation of
a bistable system which is also subject to white noise. In the resonance, f must be one half
of the average frequency f(spont) for the jumps between two states of the bistable system:
f = f(spont)/2. This condition has a simple physical interpretation: the height of the potential
barrier separating the two potential wells varies periodically with a period which is half of the
period deﬁned by f, and the best opportunity to get to another potential well is to hop when the
potential barrier is lowest possible. For the mechanical analog system the rate f(spont) = r0A
is proportional to an ’Arrhenius factor’ A = exp(−∆V/D), where ∆V is the height of the po-
tential barrier and D characterizes the intensity of the white noise. f(spont) is also proportional
to a factor r0 = ωωb/γ where ω is the frequency of small oscillations at either bottom of the
symmetric potential well, ωb is the analogous quantity at the top of barrier, and γ characterizes
the linear dissipative force (overcritial damping is assumed).
Thus, when the white noise has a correct intensity, a weak harmonic perturbation with a given
frequency is ampliﬁed in the sense that the Fourier expansion of the system’s time development
regarded as jumps between the two states contains a peak at the multiples of the frequency of
the amplitude modulated harmonic perturbation. Neuroscientists refer to this phenomenon as
a phase locking. The peaks for the higher multiples of the input frequency f are exponentially
suppressed. The notion of stochastic resonance makes sense also in the quantum context: now
quantum tunneling replaces the jumps induced by the stochastic noise.
Stochastic resonance and brain
There is a considerable empirical support for the hypothesis that stochastic resonance is respon-
sible for both the so called temporal coding of the sensory inputs to neurons (see the references
in [D6, D5] ) and for the ability of the brain to extract very weak signals from a noisy bacground.
For instance, crickets seem to detect the signals caused by their predators from a strong back-
ground noise using this mechanism. More generally, stochastic resonance is a very attractive
candidate for a quantum level neuronal mechanism for amplifying very weak EEG waves to a
ﬁring pattern in turn amplifying the original EEG waves ampliﬁed again by the stochastic reso-
nance... citeeegII. Ampliﬁcation of em ﬁelds associated with ELF MEs is analogous to physical
growth would be basically in question and p-adic MEs (memes) could use any means to achieve
this. The development of individual indeed involves the gradual emergence of higher frequency
ELF waves above the delta band background.
Stochastic resonance and people seeing elves and auras
It is interesting to apply the stochastic resonance model also to other experiences usually believed
to be hallucinatory and purely brain generated. Some of us claim to have the ability to see
elves and auras, and an interesting question is whether one could artiﬁcially induce this kind of
ability by tuning the noise level of the visual perceptive ﬁeld suitably. My own strange and often
frightening OBE type experiences induced by the noise of refrigerator or central heating batteries
could be partially understood in terms of stochastic resonance. From the visual hallucinations
during my great experience I remember the strange conviction that this what I see is always
present in the visual ﬁeld and that I have in some strange manner only become conscious about
its presence, much in the same manner as one suddenly becomes conscious of a well-deﬁned
pattern in the autostereogram containing only what looks random points.
A stochastic resonance created by the brain itself and making possible the perception of an
already existing weak visual input would conform with this interpretation. The same general

608
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
explanation might apply as such to the case of EMDR experiences: the EMDR method could
optimize the level of the background visual noise making possible to amplify weak signals always
present in the visual and other perceptive ﬁelds.
Finally, the claimed encounters with the
deceased induced by the presence of a medium could also be explained by the ability of medium
to induce a situation in which an actual weak visual signal is ampliﬁed to a conscious perception.
It is easy to guess the reaction of a skeptic to these unconventional interpretations, and it might
well be that pattern completion indeed generates information which it is not actually present
originally. It is however good to remember that until quite recently the dominating theory about
dreams was that cortex does its best to cook up something from a random input coming from
the brain stem. For a non-skeptic person with some spiritual traits and taking his/her dreams
as an essential part of the personal subjective existence this kind of interpretation seems highly
absurd and even humiliating. The revision of this view has been forced by the accumulating
knowledge supporting the view that dreaming is a cognitive ability learned before the age of
eight, and also by the observation that dreaming as a virtual world life has an obvious survival
value. Continuining in spirit of this section, one might even see the role of brain stem as a
producer of the background noise making possible the ampliﬁcation of the weak signals from the
higher levels of the self hierarchy to dreams (at least in some cases).
1/f noise amplifying itself via white noise?
What are the physical correlates of the MEs representing memes and being perhaps ampliﬁed
by both brain and by the electronic instruments in ITC? Besides white noise there is also 1/f
noise encountered practically everywhere [D1] . The origin of the 1/f noise is poorly understood.
In TGD framework 1/f noise could be seen as a signature of real mindlike space-time sheets
(giving rise to sensory qualia). 1/f noise is a good candidate for the physical correlate for the
real counterparts of memes realized as MEs with the information represented by an amplitude
modulated carrier wave. Also EEG could be seen as resulting from the ampliﬁcation of 1/f
noise (delta band for EEG resembles the spectrum of the so called spherics [F3] ). The real
counterparts of these opportunistic memes would correspond to amplitude modulated ELF waves
using all possible means of self expression and using also stochastic resonance mechanism to
amplify remote mental interactions (this brings in mind the mysterious sea in the sciﬁnovel
’Solaris’ of Stanislaw Lem!).
Stochastic resonance and ITC
An important question is how the message is ampliﬁed and ﬁltered from the background noise
possibly present. A possible answer to this question is stochastic resonance. Stochastic resonance
could occur in the receiving instrument and/or in the brain of the receiver. ITC, in particular
EVP research indeed supports the view that certain background noise is necessary for receiving
messages. On basis of this observation it has been proposed that stochastic resonance (the article
[D6] is an excellent review about the principles and applications of the stochastic resonance) is
the mechanism of EVP.
Stochastic resonance requires a bistable system (for instance, double potential well) or an ex-
citable system having metastable states. An essentially non-linear phenomenon is in question.
Signal is in a role of the harmonic external force: the output of the bistable system is inter-
preted as a transformed signal. If one takes seriously the claim about the positive eﬀects of
the white noise on tape recordings, bistable system must reside either in the electronic system
transforming sound signal to an electric signal or in the brain of the experimenter serving as a
relay station between the sender and electronic instrument in the proposed model.
TGD Universe is quantum spin glass which means that any system should be characterized by
fractal spin glass energy landscape containing valleys (energy minima) inside valleys inside...
This of course means that there is plenty of bistable systems. TGD also predicts new kinds of
dynamical degrees of freedom not predicted by standard physics, so called zero modes, which
typically characterize the shape and size of 3-surface and also so called K¨ahler ﬁeld (essentially
Maxwell type ﬁeld) of space-time surface.
These new degrees of freedom could provide the

11.5. TGD based model for instrumental transcommunications
609
required new degrees of freedom possibly making also the relevant parts of electronic instruments
bistable systems.
1. Does the brain of the receiver contain the bistable systems?
Skeptic would argue that the noise used to promote the receival of the messages is what cheats
the brain of the poor pseudoscientist to recognize a feature which is not actually present in the
incoming signal. The skeptic might be quite right although after listening the some of recordings
I have a tendency to believe that there are actual messages there. One could however turn around
the argument of skeptic. Perhaps it is indeed the brain of the experimenter where the bistable
system resides and ampliﬁes the very weak signal from the sender and sends it to the electronic
instrument in electronic form. Stochastic resonance in experimenter’s brain would be involved
also with the receival of the feedback signals from the instrument by the sender of the message.
This model has several satisfactory features.
(a) The model is consistent with the latest facts about brain science [D6, D5] . The model
is also universal in the sense that if does not require discarnate entities to be ingenious
electric engineers: they can learn by trial and error how to generate desired messages by
aﬀecting the electronic instrument.
(b) The model would explain why some experimenters are better than the others in receiving
messages. They are like crickets able to distinguish very weak input from the high noise. If
feedback from experimenter’s brain to the sender is involved this in turn helps the sender
to learn to generate desired messages. The model is also consistent with the fact that the
highly tuned system which works perfectly for a particular experimenter, does not work
for the other experimenters. Note that the magnetic mirror bridges between experimenter
and electronic instrument are essential part of the system.
The hypothesis could be tested by purposefully building EVP and ITC instruments for which
the background noise can be varied.
2. Do electronic systems contain bistable systems?
The hypothesis that the electronic system contains the bistable system is subject to so strong
additional constraints that it does not look too plausible in standard physics framework. If the
leakage of ionic currents from the magnetic ﬂux tubes to the wires of the electronic induced
by MEs gives rise to the electronic signal, stochastic resonance is perhaps not needed since the
background noise is very weak. It must be however emphasized that many-many-sheeted space-
time plus spin glass degeneracy might provide new physics mechanisms of transforming the ITC
signal to electronic signal.
The very fact that the electronic information transfer systems should not induce large distortions
of the signal, requires that the system is eﬀectively linear. Bistable systems are highly non-
linear systems unless the signal fed into the system represents suﬃciently strong external force
in which case system is analogous to a one-dimensional particle in an external harmonic force:
archetypal model is the potential well V (x) = −x2 + x4. In case of magnetic tape the direction
of magnetization would naturally represent the two potential wells and hopping of the particle
between wells would correspond to the changing direction of magnetization. Thus, if bistable
systems are involved, ordinary signals must represent strong external forces for which the system
is eﬀectively linear and non-linearity can be important only for very weak signals. In case of
EVP this requires that possible messages should be contained by the portions of the magnetic
tape, where ordinary signal is reduced to mere noise and the noise is suﬃciently weak. Already
this requirement might kill the hypothesis.
To test this option, one should ﬁnd whether the electronic system transforming the sound to
electric current contains portions modellable as bistable systems fed by an external signal for
suﬃciently weak input signals. If this is the case, then model could be tested by varying the
intensity of the external noise to see whether this has any eﬀect on the probability of receiving
the messages.

11.5.7
How the signal is transformed to a signal in electronic instru-
ment
One should also understand how the transformation of the ITC signal to the signal appearing
in electronic instrument such as tape recorder, telephone, or radio receiver occurs.
Direct radio signal
The simplest situation is direct radio signal.
It is known that the voices tend to appear in
the silent portions of radio signal containing only noise. This is of course natural since in this
manner the masking of the signal can be avoided and might allow also stochastic resonance. If
the sender or magnetospheric multi-brained conscious entity has managed to code the signal to
AM or FM radiowave, and if the brain or body of the experimenter has managed to amplify it
and redirect it to the instrument, then the transformation to an audible signal is not a problem.
”Paranormal” signal to a magnetic tape
The ﬁrst possibility is that primary messages appear as ME having a Fourier decomposition
resembling suﬃciently that of the sound wave, and giving rise to the required vibrations of
atoms. MEs are the basic candidates for the carriers of these waves and the Fourier spectrum of
the voice with respect to frequency could be coded into the Fourier spectrum of em or Z0 ﬁelds
associated with ME. Hence ELF frequency range would be in question. Phase information is
crucial: anyone can easily verify that a reversed speech usually consists of a gibberish despite the
fact that the Fourier spectra are same for speech and reverse speech. This suggests an amplitude
modulation of the carrier wave or fast amplitude modulation producing ripples to the carrier
wave as a candidate for the representation of the information contained by ME.
The sound frequency range involved with the sounds heard by humans is in the interval 20 −
20.000 Hz meaning the lengths of ME would vary between Earth radius and 10 kilometers. This
spectrum is also claimed to be important for water memory and the mechanism of homeopathy
[I14] .
A concrete model for the process might look like following.
(a) The signal is ﬁrst transformed to an electric current, which subsequently induces a short-
lasting magnetization of a soft electromagnet which in turn induces a permanent local
magnetization of hard ferromagnet (magnetic tape). The strength and sign of the local
magnetization depends on the strength of the current which in turn codes the strength of
the sound signal. A similar transformation to an electric current occurs also for the signal
in case of visual ITC.
(b) A concrete manner to generate the electric current inducing the magnetization would be by
inducing a leakage of a supra current from magnetic ﬂux tubes to the atomic space-time
sheets of the current wire responsible for the magnetization of the soft electro-magnet.
This leakage could be induced by microwaves by a mechanism discussed in [K32] . The
modulation of the microwave by sound wave would imply the modulation of the current
automatically. An analogous mechanism could be at work for the radio receiver.
Transformation of em signal to sound signal before entering the tape recorder
Classical EVP suggests that the basic signal enters to the magnetic tape as an electric signal.
On the other hand, the experimental results reported by Alec MacRae [J2] are consistent with
the assumption that real sounds generate the signal and that electromagnetic signal does not
generate a signal in the microphone. The latter conclusion comes from the observation that
Faraday cage around microphone does not aﬀect the communication. In TGD framework this
conclusion cannot be made since Faraday cage is not expected to aﬀect MEs. The acoustic
insulation of another microphone however weakens the voice so that it seems that a genuine

11.5. TGD based model for instrumental transcommunications
611
acoustic signalling is in question. This does not of course imply that the generation of real sounds
is the only mechanism: in the presence of feedback the best communication mode available could
be used.
TGD based model for the real sounds generated by meteors heard both directly and recorded
by microphones is based on electromagnetic signals coming along magnetic mirrors associated
with the sensory magnetic canvas and acting as wave guides and transformed to ordinary sounds
via the coupling with objects at the surface of Earth. Whatever the details of em signal-sound
transformation are, it certainly exists, and could be involved also now: the electromagnetic
signal could come either from the magnetic sensory canvas of the experimenter, of the sender,
or from the magnetosphere containing the multi-brained self serving as a relay station. Higher
harmonics of the frequencies 37-43 Hz appearing in case of meteors [F1] would be however
required to generate the voices or shorter magnetic mirrors should be involved.
One can imagine several mechanisms for the transformation of the primary signal to sounds.
(a) The mechanism transforming electromagnetic signal to sound wave could rely on piezo-
electricity and frequency resonance. Quartz crystals are excellent piezo-electrets and used
in radio receivers and senders. Also body acts as a piezo-electret and the body of the
experimenter could transform the signal to sound. Human body could act also as a Z0-
piezo-electric transforming the Z0 signal to an ordinary sound. The so called oto-acoustic
sounds (audible sounds emanating from ears) could result in the same manner.
Also
material objects of the acoustic environment could serve the same purpose.
(b) The phenomenon of microwave hearing suggests that brain and/or body could also trans-
form microwave signals propagating along ELF ME to ordinary sounds.
11.5.8
Tests for the model of ITC
Most tests of the ITC reduce to tests for the general mechanism of remote mental interactions,
which should be also at work in length scales below body size (bio-telepathy) and for sensory
representations realized at the magnetic body. This is good news in the sense that good models
usually explain many apparently unrelated phenomena and bad news in the sense that predic-
tions are not ITC speciﬁc.
1. Tests for the motion of electromagnetic bridges.
(a) Since the development of the magnetic mirror bridges between experimenter and electronic
instrument takes time, the replacement of the magnetic tape in EVP with identical one,
might make the performance poorer.
(b) One could test the importance of the magnetic ﬂux tubes by varying the strength of the
local magnetic ﬁeld (note that magnetic tape has a natural coupling to the magnetic ﬂux
tube structures of Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld) to see whether Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld plays a
role in the eﬀect. One could test whether the appearance of ITC messages and perturba-
tions of magnetic ﬁeld appearing at Schumann frequencies correlate. The correlations of
paranormal phenomena with sunspot activity are well-known and could be tested in case
of ITC.
(c) Maxwell’s electrodynamics, which is not equivalent with TGD, would suggest that MEs
cannot penetrate Faraday’s cage so that ITC would not be possible inside Faraday cage. In
many-sheeted space-time this argument is lost because MEs by deﬁnition are em bridges
outside the atomic space-time sheets where the Faraday cage acts. If MEs cannot penetrate
Faraday cage, the TGD based model for sensory representations would fall down since it
would predict that person in ideal Faraday cage could not have sensory experiences! Be
as it may, one can test this aspect by putting the experimenter and/or the instrument in
Faraday cage.

612
Chapter 11. Quantum Model of Paranormal Phenomena
(d) One should also test directly whether body and brain act as laser like ampliﬁers of em
radiation at, say, audible frequencies. The work of Gariaev [I17] shows that irradiation
of DNA with visible light produces radiowaves also at audible frequencies. The work of
Blacman and others [J44] shows that the irradiation with ELF waves at EEG frequency
range induces biological eﬀects.
2. Tests for the ionic leakage mechanism. For instance, the appearance of ions not originally in
the system by the leakage of the supra currents and the dissipative eﬀects caused by the leakage
would be a good signature for the eﬀect. These tests are discussed in [K32] . In the recent case
one such system would the current wire inducing the magnetization of the magnetic tape.
3. Tests for the ideas about the communication method.
(a) In remote healing the changes of alpha waves in EEG are reported to correlate with the
intentions communicated by the healer.
Alpha waves dominate when sensory input is
absent, in particular the closing of eyes stimulates alpha waves. This is consistent with
the fact that EVP requires silent and dark room. A possible test would be to record the
EEG of the experimenter and look whether there is a clear change in the activity in alpha
band both when the tape is on and when the tape is listened to and ﬁnd whether there are
recognizable changes of alpha activity. In particular, one could see whether alpha activity
changes at the time when the message appears to the magnetic tape. The lowest Schumann
frequency 7.8 Hz is especially interesting in this respect. On basis of the experiments of
Mark Germine, also the 11 Hz frequency is interesting [J66] .
(b) The sounds detected from meteors [F1] are in the thalamocortical 37-44 Hz frequency
band [K65] suggesting that magnetic sensory canvas mediates ELF perturbations to both
brains and to electronic instruments at this frequency range. One could in principle test
whether thalamo-cortical resonance band in the EEG of the experimenter contains some-
thing correlating with the received message.
(c) Are persons able to receive the ITC messages also able to hear microwaves.
(d) Are the sounds in EVP are received electronically or acoustically. Both mechanisms might
be involved. Alec MacRae has demonstrated and in his experiments signal is received as a
sound [J2] . One could also test whether the pitch of the sound correlates with the acoustic
environment (big room–small room).
(e) One could test the role of the stochastic resonance by varying the level of the acoustic or
radio noise. Here explicit formulas for the noise optimal for a signal of given frequency are
available [D6] .
4. Tests for the notion of magnetospheric selves.
The notion of magnetospheric selves might be crucial for the solution of the knowhow problem
and the experiments of Mark Germine [J66] can be seen as a pioneer work in the testing of this
hypothesis.
5. Tests for the notion of history editing. History editing is not necessary for understanding
of ITC but one could test whether it is involved. Let an outsider, presumably not able to act
as a relay station, listen to the magnetic tape ﬁrst and document whether he/she received any
message. Suppose that he/she detects no recognizable message. Next let the experimenter listen
the same tape, and report what he/she found: during this session the feedback mechanism could
transform the message to a recognizable form by aﬀecting the geometric past at the moment
the magnetic tape was on. Suppose that the experimenter indeed recognizes a message. Let
an outsider listen the tape again to see whether there is any recognizable message now.
If
the proposed mechanism is correct, the outsider who did not hear any message in the ﬁrst

11.5. TGD based model for instrumental transcommunications
613
trial, should hear now a clear message. Note that one cannot replace external person with a
computer since the computer records change in quantum jumps too! Note also that even the
geometric memories of the external person might change if they are comparable to mechanical
records: genuine subjective memories are required. Also the repeated listening of the tape by the
experimenter could improve the quality of the message and the above experimental arrangement
could be iterated.


Chapter 12
TGD Based Model for OBEs
12.1
Introduction
Out-of-body experiences (OBEs) [J128, J35, J92] are often understood as experience of seeing
oneself from a position outside of the body. According to Susan Blackmore [J35] , OBEs are
rather common: from 5 to 35 percent of subjects reports of having had at least one OBE.
According to studies persons having OBEs seem to be perfectly healthy.
OBEs are poorly
understood in the framework of neuro science and pose a challenge for the reductionistic world
view.
In TGD framework the notion of magnetic body provides an attractive starting point in at-
tempts to understand what OBEs and related experiences are. The basic idea is that magnetic
body serves eﬀectively as a mirror deﬁning a third person view as a cognitive representation also
in ordinary wake-up state and that during OBEs this representation becomes sensory represen-
tation. Magnetic body need not always be a personal magnetic body but could correspond to
a magnetic body receiving information from several brains (collective consciousness), magnetic
body of another person, or be even associated with ”dead” matter.
The progress in identifying dark matter as a phase of matter with large value of Planck constant
making possible macroscopic quantum coherence has led to the vision about dark matter at
magnetic ﬂux quanta as quantum controller of ordinary matter in living systems. The Bose-
Einstein condensates of dark photons decaying via decoherence to ordinary photons mediate
interactions between ordinary and dark matter and the hypothesis is that dark photon ”laser”
beams from body and brain reﬂected at magnetic ﬂux quanta give rise to third person aspect
of consciousness which in OBEs and related experiences are realized as sensory representations.
The identiﬁcation of bio-photons as end products of the de-coherence of dark photon beams is
natural.
Zero energy ontology and the notion of causal diamond (or CD deﬁned roughly as the inter-
section of future and past directed lightcones) brings additional quantitative ingredients to the
model. Sub-CDs deﬁne imbedding space (M 4 × CP2) correlates for selves and by holography
the 2-D partonic 2-surfaces at the light-like future and past boundaries of CDs are the ultimate
space-time correlates for mental images. The moduli space for CDs makes possible a more de-
tailed view about sensory representations discussed in the chapter ”Quantum Model for Sensory
Representations” [K64] .
A further new element is the vision about life as something in the intersection of real and p-
adic worlds. The most important outcome is that the notion of number theoretic entanglement
negentropy making sense in this situation is positive so that entanglement carries conscious
information.
The fusion of selves (in particular mental image) by negentropic entanglement
is experienced as expansion of consciousness. It is negentropic entanglement between parts of
biological body and corresponding parts of the magnetic body and biological body which makes
living system living. This negentropic entanglement between magnetic body and biological body
is important also for OBEs.

Chapter 12. TGD Based Model for OBEs
The model leads also to a model for dreams, hallucinations, sensory feedback from brain to
sensory organs, and directed attention. Concrete models for how dark photons can give rise to
experiences in various sensory modalities such as vision, hearing, olfaction, and tactile senses,
are proposed.
I am grateful for Tiaan Brink for sending a little summary about OBEs. This article inspired
the attempt to fuse the TGD inspired ideas related to OBEs to a coherent theory.
12.1.1
OBEs, autoscopy, heautoscopy, and other strange experiences
Phenomenological characterization
The phenomenological characterization of OBEs [J15] has been discussed in [J92] . A precise
deﬁnition of OBE is to have sensation of being outside the body. Autoscopic experience involves
a also a sensation of seeing a mirror double of the body or part of it or at least experiencing
its presence. There is a form of AS in which some internal organs are perceived. In one form
form of AS only the presence of double is experienced. AS experiences are often accompanied
by physical diﬃculties such as migraine episodes and epilepsy.
Heautoscopy refers to an experience of meeting one’s alter ego, doppelganger. The main diﬀer-
ences to AS is that in AS the double is mirror image and that alter ego is experienced to have
also duplicated features of psychological self.
OBEs are classiﬁed to parasomatic and asomatic experiences according to whether the person
experiences of having body or not. In aparasomatic experience a detachment from both the
physical and parasomatic body is experienced. Blackmore suggest that OBE starts when sensory
input from the body ceases while person remains conscious [J35] . This brings in mind the
notion of subtle body of spiritual practices identiﬁed as the body experienced during lucid
dreaming [J138] . The notions of guardian angle and ba-ka double of ancient Egypt, could relate
to the double body too.
There is also a classiﬁcation of OBEs to asensory, naturalistic and supernaturalistic ones. Asen-
sory experience lacks sensory percepts about environment, naturalistic one involves perception
of familiar surroundings, and supernaturalistic other-worldly realms like heaven or visits to other
planets and contacts with aliens.
One can distinguish between natural and enforced OBEs. Natural OBEs are triggered by ex-
haustion, illness, traumatic events, NDEs, meditation, etc.. Enforced experiences can result
from intoxication, anesthesia, hypnosis, etc..
OBEs induced by electric stimulation
Relatively recently OBEs and AS experiences have been produced by an electric stimulation of
the angular gyrus [J94] . Angular gurus is located in the parietal lobe, near the superior edge of
the temporal lobe, and is involved in processes related to verbal communication and cognition
and also with the transformation of written language to internal monologue. The experience
developed to a full ﬂedged OBE as the intensity of electric stimulation was increased.
The
electric stimulation induced responses in vestibular and sensory-motor systems, two of three
systems which govern body balance.
According to experimenters, OBE and AS frequently involves what they call pathological sen-
sations of position, movement and perceived completeness of one’s own body. These include
vestibular sensations such as ﬂoating, ﬂying, elevation and rotation, visual body-part illusions
(illusory shortening, transformation or movement of an extremity) and the experiences of seeing
one’s body only partially during OBE or AS. Authors believe that these experiments yield neu-
rological evidence about the common neurological mechanism behind OBEs and AS experiences.
[J92] [J16] has criticized the interpretation of experiments.
(a) Only single subject person was studied. She suﬀered from temporal lobe epilepsy and
the epileptic region was at distance of about 2 cm from angular gyrus. Hence one can

12.2. TGD inspired model for OBEs
617
ask whether genuine OBEs were in question and whether the results generalize to healthy
persons.
(b) The OBE was not typical. For instance, body was seen only partially and the conscious
attempt of the subject person to examine it more closely led to its disappearance. The
environment was not perceived.
(c) The claimed localization of the spot inducing OBEs to angular gyrus might be an illusion.
Same researchers have represented results in which the OBE is induced in a diﬀerent
manner.
Interestingly, the experience is associated with the generation of 4 Hz theta
wave, which corresponds to the dominating EEG band during sleep.
(d) The reductionistic conclusion that OBEs can be reduced to neuropathology and are thus
”only” hallucinations is not justiﬁed. What has been shown is that electric stimulation of
angular gyrus helps to induce the OBE and this leaves a lot of room for theorizing.
Explanations of OBEs and related experiences
The explanations for OBEs can be divided to two classes.
(a) Something is assumed to leave the body.
This something could be something physical or non-physical (”astral”). In some cases
people who have had OBE share reported of having perceived objects that were actually
there and having experienced events and dialogue that truly happened. Charles Tart has
documented the case of Miss Z [J129] who in controlled experiments was able to deliver
the randomly selected ﬁve digit number which was in a position which could be seen only
from the position out of her body. Telepathy would be an alternative explanation for this.
(b) Nothing leaves the body.
Parapsychological explanations involve remote sensing and hallucinations. Psychological
explanations regard OBEs as basically hallucinations. The observation that electrical stim-
ulation generates both AS and OBE could be seen as a support for this interpretation. Of
course, one can ask what hallucinations really are. Furthermore, the reports about seeing
internal organs during AS experience [J29] are not easily explainable as hallucinations.
TGD based model does not ﬁt into either category. The model involves the notion of magnetic
body serving as the third person receiving visual stimulus from the body and reﬂecting it back
to the brain where its is processed. In this model the conﬂict between hallucinatory character of
AS and OBEs and a real perception of body from outside is only apparent. The basic mechanism
allows to develop also a more detailed model for dreams, hallucinations, third person aspect of
wake-up consciousness, and directed attention.
12.2
TGD inspired model for OBEs
It is good to develop the model for OBEs by ﬁrst summarizing what OBEs are and then listing
the basic TGD speciﬁc ingredients of the model and then proceed by making questions (I hope
that reader does not feel them to be leading).

12.2.2
Questions
In the following the model is developed by posing questions about OBEs.
Where the information processing giving meaning to what is seen is carried out?
Seeing is much more than just receiving the photons on retina, since a lot of information pro-
cessing is needed to give meaning to what is seen. This essentially involves a decomposition of
visual input to recognized objets having relations to each other and to the past of perceiver.
This applies also to the visual percepts during OBEs. The most natural candidate for the system
processing the visual stimulus and giving it meaning is the brain of the subject person.
Sharing of mental images allows to consider an alternative interpretation based on telepathy.
The sensory organs in other bodies receive the visual stimulus and and other brains do the
information processing. For instance, ”unconscious” victim of accident could share the fused
mental images of people around the place of accident. This would explain the case of Miss Z
studied by Tart [J129] as telepathy.
Are OBEs ”only” hallucinations?
In TGD framework the ﬁrst possibility is that the sensory stimulus is always artiﬁcial and comes
from brain to eyes and other sensory organs by back projection. OBE would be a dream like
cognitive representation, simulation rather than a real percept. REM is expected to always
accompany OBEs in this case.
There is an objection against this idea. If person is unconscious or has NDE, it is questionable
whether she is able to construct such high level cognitive representation as the representation of
the state of her own body as seen by outsider is, and even transform it to a sensory representation.
One can also ask what hallucinations really are. In TGD framework hallucinations must be
generated by an artiﬁcial sensory stimulus so that hallucinations and genuine OBEs might
involve the same basic mechanism.

620
Chapter 12. TGD Based Model for OBEs
Does OBE originate from an actual sensory stimulus?
The well-known fact that body parts indeed contain holograms about other body parts [I20]
(see the discussion in [K32] ) and the TGD view about the relationship between dark and living
matter [K20] allows to consider seriously the possibility that OBE originates from an actual
sensory stimulus.
The dark photon laser beams emanating from the body would be received by a magnetic body
containing dark matter at some level in the hierarchy of magnetic bodies and would be reﬂected
back to the receiving sensory organs along MEs possibly parallel to magnetic ﬂux tubes rather
than space-time sheets along which ordinary visual input arrives.
It is quite possible that several magnetic bodies in the hierarchy are involved. The magnetic
bodies involved need not always correspond to a personal magnetic body and could receive input
from several biological bodies and remote vision and telepathy might involve signals from brain
reﬂected to a second brain via multi-brainy magnetic body. Magnetic bodies could be associated
also with ”dead” matter.
In this picture the case of Miss Z could be understood in two alternative manners. A dark photon
beam possibly created by the visual representation of the random number (does ”dead” matter
generate suﬃciently intense beams of this kind?) and reﬂected by personal magnetic body could
be in question. Alternatively, the magnetic body involved could receive the information about
random number from the brain of the experimenter and reﬂect it to the brain of the subject
person.
Why does electrical stimulation induce OBEs?
Electrical stimulation of angular gyrus induces OBEs just as the stimulation of neurons of
temporal lobe induces long term sensory memories.
In neurological ”brain only” approach
the interpretation would be that the responses in the vestibular and somatosensory system
induce the AS and OBE as hallucinations. In TGD framework the response in vestibular and
somatosensory system would be interpreted as a response to an actual experience of being in a
detached position and orientation, and brain would processes genuine sensory data about being
in detached position.
One might think that the temporal ordering between the experiences and these responses would
allow to decide which causes what. In TGD framework negative energy signals propagating
backwards in the geometric time are however a basic element of brain functioning and this
criterion need not be apply.
One imagine two mechanism generating OBEs.
(a) The mechanism inducing visual OBE and related experiences could simply turn oﬀthe
ordinary sensory input so that only the dark photon beams from the magnetic body and
reﬂected back from biological body would contribute to the visual stimulus. This would
occur automatically during dreams and NDE experiences.
(b) The sensory input from the magnetic body could be ampliﬁed. Time mirror mechanism
could be responsible for this ampliﬁcation [K87] . During epilepsy strong electric ﬁelds
generated by brain during epilepsy induce starvation of neurons and the electrical stim-
ulation of angular gyrus could have the same eﬀect. Starving neurons would generate a
beam of phase conjugate (negative energy) dark photons received by magnetic body in
order to get metabolic energy. The magnetic body would be in a state analogous to a
population inverted (possibly many-sheeted) laser deﬁning a hologram like representation
of the body. The receival of negative energy photons would induce a cascade like induced
return to the ground state and amplify the dark photon beam arriving from magnetic body
so that it would not be masked by the ordinary visual input anymore and would give rise
to a percept.

12.2. TGD inspired model for OBEs
621
12.2.3
Dark matter hierarchy, zero energy ontology, negentropic en-
tanglement, OBEs
Dark matter hierarchy, zero energy ontology, and the notion of negentropic entanglement lead
to new insights also about OBEs.
Basic ingredients of the TGD inspired model
The model of OBEs involves several ingredients that are speciﬁc to TGD.
(a) Magnetic bodies and ﬁeld bodies are excellent candidates for the ”third person” seeing
the ordinary body. Magnetic body could receive a visual stimulus from ordinary body
and reﬂect it back as a visual stimulus during OBE processed by the brain of the subject
person.
Thus body would see itself from the perspective of the magnetic body.
Also
dreams and hallucinations might involve the same mechanism.
In the case of hearing
sounds created by subject person could be reﬂected back to her ears or more plausibly,
microwave hearing [I23] could be involved.
(b) Topological light rays (”massless extremals”, MEs) are an element of TGD having no coun-
terpart in Maxwell’s ED and play a key role in TGD inspired theory of consciousness. The
interpretation of MEs has remained somewhat obscure. The development of TGD based
model for dark matter residing at magnetic ﬂux tubes and characterized by large value of
Planck constant implying quantum coherence in even macroscopic length and time scales
changed the situation in this respect. The model for dark matter as macroscopically quan-
tum coherent phase is discussed brieﬂy in this book in chapter [K58] and more extensively
in the book ”Genes, Memes, Qualia, and Semitrance” [K20] . MEs can be identiﬁed as
space-time correlates of Bose-Einstein condensates (”laser beams”) of dark photons. It
is however still unclear whether ordinary laser beams actually correspond to dark photon
Bose-Einstein condensates and become visible only in de-coherence to ordinary photons.
Negative energy MEs can be identiﬁed as correlates for phase conjugate laser beams of
dark photons. The so called time mirror mechanism is universal building block of basic
biological and brain functions [K87] .
(c) Bio-systems as conscious holograms is one of the key ideas of TGD approach [K8] . Bio-
holograms [I20] suggest themselves as primary sensory stimuli quite generally. Biological
body could generate dark photon ”laser beams” received by magnetic bodies and reﬂected
back to retina or perhaps to pineal gland [J85] , the ”third eye”. This would explain AS
as well as the images of internal organs [J29] . Also other systems, at least living systems,
could be seen from the perspective of the magnetic body. Remote vision hypothesis testable
by using living targets not visible in ordinary sense. This would give also rise to telepathy
if reﬂection occurs from magnetic bodies of another person.
(d) In TGD framework sensory organs are identiﬁed as seats of primary sensory experience
and brain only constructs symbolic representations about percept, in particular identiﬁes
objects of perceptive ﬁeld. This does not exclude a considerable back projection to sensory
organs modifying the sensory input. Dreaming involves back projection to sensory organs
inducing artiﬁcial sensory experiences as simulation. One possibility is that dreams and
hallucinations represent direct back projection to sensory organs along neural pathways.
An alternative view is that the projection involves dark photon beams generated by brain
and reﬂected back from the magnetic body. If OBEs are hallucinations, the visual sensory
memories of the subject person about herself could serve as building blocks to generate
simulation about what person looks like when seen from outside.
(e) Sharing and fusion of mental images is one of the basic notions of TGD inspired theory
of consciousness [K87, K8] . One can ask whether OBE involves sharing of the visual
experience of other persons involved about subject person.
If this were the case, the
presence of other persons would be necessary to have OBE. Sharing of mental images
would explain the case of Miss Z as telepathy.

Dark matter hierarchy
The identiﬁcation of dark matter as a hierarchy of quantum phases labeled by the values of
Planck constant [K24] provides additional insights about OBE experiences. Planck constant
is quantized and can have arbitrarily large values and since Compton length and other analo-
gous quantum lengths and times scale as Planck constant, this means macroscopic and macro-
temporal quantum coherence and a reduced rate of dissipation.
Also the magnetic body controlling biological body (actually onion-like hierarchy of them) is
assumed to carry dark matter and (forgetting ontological delicacies) dark matter could be seen
as the agent responsible for the quantum control of ordinary matter in living systems. The value
of Planck constant becomes also a measure for the evolutionary level of the living system and
great leaps in evolution can be identiﬁed as transitions increasing the maximum value of ℏin
”personal” hierarchy of magnetic bodies [K21] .
Zero energy ontology and causal diamonds
Zero energy ontology is second new element of quantum TGD and states that all physical states
have vanishing net values of conserved quantum numbers. Zero energy ontology provides a ﬁrm
justiﬁcation for the notion of negative energy signals consisting of (say) phase conjugate photons
propagating to the geometric past. These negative energy signals are crucial element of the time
mirror mechanism playing a central role in the general mechanism for intentional action, remote
metabolism, and long term memory.
Causal diamond (CD) deﬁned roughly as the intersection of future and past directed lightcones
serves as an imbedding space correlate for zero energy state. Space-time sheets representing zero
energy states are inside CD and the future resp. past boundaries of CD carry positive resp.
negative energy parts of zero energy states.
What is important from the point of view of consciousness theory is that CDs serve as imbedding
space correlates of selves and sub-CDs as those for sub-selves (mental images). Sub-CDs are
very much analogous to music instruments in the sense that the frequencies which come as
harmonics of the fundamental frequency deﬁned by the proper time distance between tips of
CD (coming as powers of two) resonate with the geometry of CD and put it to ”ring”. Sub-
CDs could be seen as an analog of radio receiver as far as sensory representations are considered
and sending antenna as far as the motor control of biological body is involved. This allows to
communicate sensory data from brain to sub-CDs at magnetic body CD in a highly selective
manner. MEs (massless extremals) mediating the communications between magnetic body and
biological body are also very much like strings of a music instrument. This picture generalize
the earlier music metaphor applied to axonal pathways.
A more precise deﬁnition of CD is as the Cartesian product of the intersection of future and
past directed light-cone with CP2.
The hierarchy of Planck constants brings in additional
structure. There is identiﬁcation of preferred M 2 ⊂M 4 deﬁning a preferred time direction (rest
system/quantization axis for energy) and spin quantization axis.
The preferred geodesically
trivial sphere S2 ⊂CP2 and the selection of point assigned with CP2 at the future and past
boundaries of CD gives rise to a selection of quantization axes of color isospin and hyper charge.
Sensory representations are a key element of the consciousness theory and the moduli space of
CDs charactering what kind of CDs are possible brings in new representational resources.
(a) The moduli space of sub-CDs involves the position for the either tip of the sub-CD and
the naive expectation is that this position could code for the position of the perceptive
ﬁeld. If so the representation would be very concrete and since the size of CD is already for
electron with .1 lightseconds the representations is realized automatically in astrophysical
scale.
(b) The moduli space of sub-CDs assignable to the mental images with another tip ﬁxed
could represent geometric qualia. Without any further restrictions this space corresponds
to proper time constant hyperboloid of future light cone. The values of time parameter

12.2. TGD inspired model for OBEs
623
come in powers of two. One can however quite well consider the possibility that only a
discrete lattice of the hyperboloid is realized- at least in the intersection of real and p-adic
worlds.
(c) A Lorentz boost for sub-CD induces scaling of frequency and scaling of the object in the
direction of the boost. Therefore boost coded to the fundamental frequency of CD could
code for various shapes of a ﬁgure obtained by scaling. Boost of sub−CD leaving the other
tip of sub−CD invariant could also code for the velocity of object. Also the velocity of
the object of the perceptive ﬁeld could be coded to the shape of sub-CD by performing
corresponding Lorentz boots to it [K64] .
(d) The moduli space of CDs contains also the choice of quantization axes of energy (preferred
rest system) and spin as well as the choice of quantization axes of color isospin and hyper-
charge identiﬁable as ﬂag manifold SU(3)/U(1) × U(1). Mathematician Barbara Shipman
has proposed that this ﬂag manifold is involved with the representation of geometric data
in honeybee dance [A21] and I have proposed a model for what might be involved [K28] .
The moduli space of CDs is thus highly relevant for the representation of the geometric data
associated with the objects of the perceptive ﬁeld and the this data would be communicated using
MEs with harmonics of the fundamental frequency of sub-CD so that sub-CD would act like
radio receiver. This includes the position of the real object codable to the position of sub-CDs
at magnetic body, the velocity of the object of the perceptive ﬁeld codable to the Lorentz boost
changing the shape of sub-CD and represented as scaling of the frequency assigned with the
stationary object. Also the shape of perceptive ﬁeld would represent this kind of geometric data.
This picture supports the interpretation of sub-CDs as spotlights of attention giving information
about many-sheeted space-time inside the regions deﬁned by the sub-CDs. It would seem that
sub-CDs are dynamical objects created, destroyed, and shifted in quantum jumps. This picture
is also consistent with the explanation for the arrow of psychological time based on zero energy
ontology [K86] .
Negentropic entanglement
The third new element is the notion of negentropic entanglement making sense when entan-
glement probabilities are rational or even algebraic numbers. Negentropic entanglement makes
sense in the ”intersection of real and p-adic worlds” consisting of partonic surfaces whose mathe-
matical representations make sense both in real sense and p-adically. Negentropic entanglement
is possible also between diﬀerent number ﬁelds in accordance with the idea that cognition cor-
responds to p-adic number ﬁelds and cognitive representations are realized in the interections
of realities and p-adicities. Living matter is identiﬁed as matter in the intersection between real
and p-adic worlds. This view together with zero energy ontology allows precise deﬁnition for the
idea that intentional acts transform p-adic space-time sheets to real ones and for the reversal of
this transformation [K44] .
It is natural to assume that negentropic entanglement is what makes living matter living and is
involved with the sharing of mental images and with the formation of sensory representations by
entanglement. Negentropic entanglement can be also time-like. MEs are excellent candidates for
mediating this kind of entanglement whereas magnetic ﬂux tubes would naturally mediate space-
like negentropic entanglement. The sequence of negentropic entanglements would have as its
upper ends sub-CDs at highest layer of the magnetic body and sensory organs as its lower ends.
Even sensory organ could have negentropic entanglement with the real object of the perceptive
ﬁeld and this might be crucial element in the construction of the sensory representations. For
instance, the deduction of distance of the object of perceptive ﬁeld might rely on interferometry
using the dark variants of visible photons with wave length which is is of the order of the distance
to the object.

624
Chapter 12. TGD Based Model for OBEs
OBEs in more general framework
A general model for the remote mental interactions follows from a model for the living matter
by assuming that also other biological bodies can serve as targets for the control action of
the magnetic body or communicate sensory information to the magnetic body.
The notion
of negentropic entanglement favors biological systems as targets but it is of course an open
question whether also ”dead” matter could have negentropic entanglement with its magnetic
body. Ordinary intentional action would represent a particular case of remote mental interaction
in this framework.
Consider now OBEs in this general framework.
(a) During OBE experiences the mental images constructed by brain about biological body
could be absent due to the absence of the metabolic energy feed to the appropriate parts
of brain taking care of the construction of cognitive mental images about biological body
and communications of them to the magnetic body. The simplest representation would
be in terms of bit sequences with bit 1/0 represented in terms of population inverted
state/ground sate of many-sheeted laser. Negative energy signals to the geometric past
would be used to read these signals by inducing partial reduction of the population in
inverted states. In absence of metabolic energy feed 1:s would gradually transform to 0:s.
It is however essential that time-like negentropic entanglement is involved besides classical
communications. This would make it possible to share the mental images.
(b) In absence of these cognitive mental images to the magnetic body, magnetic body would
not anymore provide strict cognitive representations of biological body and virtual world
experiences would result. Since only magnetic body would contribute to the bodily ex-
perience, the low rate of dissipation due to large value of ℏwould explain the pleasant
experience about the absence of the sensory noise.
(c) This general picture could also explain why OBEs seem to correlate with neural disoders
such as epilepsy and disorders relating to perturbed body image.
During this kind of
disorders the feedback provided by the sensory and cognitive input would be lacking from
the brain regions suﬀering the neural disorder and magnetic body would be solely respon-
sible for the body image. The lacking strict correspondence between the conformations of
magnetic body and biological body would mean that the experience is hallucination from
the point of view of biological body. At the imbedding space level the ”conformations”
of the magnetic body could be rather abstract and represented in terms of positions and
other moduli of sub-CDs.
12.2.4
A more detailed model for OBEs
In the following a more detailed model for various aspects of OBEs is developed.
Do bio-photons result from the de-coherence of dark photon beams?
Bio-holography provides support for the body as a hologram (more precisely, dark photon holo-
gram). For instance, an electric stimulation of ear during Kirlian imaging of a ﬁnger tip creates
a Kirlian photo from which it is possible to abstract a hologram of ear [I20] (for a TGD based
model see [K8, K32] ). This suggests that body parts can in some sense ”see” each other. In
particular, brain can ”see” body parts (note that bacteria possess a primitive IR vision based
on micro-tubules): this of course need not correspond to a conscious vision at our level of self
hierarchy.
The biological function of bio-photons [I13] is poorly understood, and they are an excellent
candidate for ordinary photons resulting when dark photon beam de-coheres. TGD based model
of bio-photons can be found in [K35] and the identiﬁcation as dark photons is discussed in [K20]
. The ﬁndings of Peter Gariaev about the eﬀects of visible laser light on DNA [I17] and so called
phantom DNA eﬀect [I16] provide a further support for the biological importance of biophotons
(see the discussions in [K20, K35] ).

12.2. TGD inspired model for OBEs
625
What is the mechanism of out-of-body hearing?
Mechanism could be even more general and work also in the case of other qualia. In particular,
hearing might involve similar reﬂection of sound waves at larger space-time sheets from the
magnetic body and heard as ”other-worldly” sounds.
A more plausible option is that the auditory sensation is generated by dark microwave photons
reﬂected back from magnetic body. Microwave [K61] [I23] is indeed a well-known but poorly
understood phenomenon and the generation of microwaves by plants after sunset correlates also
with taos hum [I36] (see the discussion in [K37] ) which does not generate any response in
microphones but reﬂects the features of the acoustic environment.
The auditory and visual hallucinations of schizophrenic persons would represent in this frame-
work a genuine sensory input. The notion of bicameral mind introduced by Jaynes [J75] discussed
in TGD framework in [K72] would ﬁt also nicely with this picture. The ”god” controlling the
behavior of bicameral by giving explicit commands would correspond to some magnetic body,
not necessarily that of the subject person, but a magnetic body receiving input from several
brains in the social group and representing collective consciousness.
Where are the sensory receptors giving rise to the primary sensory experience?
The simplest guess is that the visual stimulus from the magnetic body is received by eyes. The
fact that REM accompanies visual dreaming supports this view in the case of dreams. The
receiving sensory organ could be also pineal gland [K12, K65] , ”third eye”, the seat of the
soul according to Descartes [J85] . Pineal gland is known to contain retinal pigments and its
counterpart in more primitive animals is known to function as a genuine eye. A simple test in
the case of artiﬁcial OBEs is to look whether the electric stimulation of OBEs generates also
REM.
If OBE hearing is indeed microwave hearing, the identiﬁcation of the primary sensory receptors
is not obvious, although their existence cannot be denied.
The insect olfaction relies on infrared light as discovered by Callahan [I10] (see the discussion
in [K28] ). One might therefore wonder whether also humans possess olfactory receptors sensitive
to IR light, and whether the emission of dark IR photons reﬂected from magnetic body could
play some role in olfaction and in the generation of olfactory hallucinations. One can even ask,
whether the molecular recognition mechanism underlying chemical senses relies on IR light. It
is known that human nose contains so called vomeronasal organ [J3] sensitive to odors having
sexual or social meaning but that these odors do not give rise to a conscious experience.
It is known that blind persons can learn to ”see” when their skin is stimulated by electromag-
netic ﬁelds representing the environment. Perhaps dark photon beams could induce also tactile
sensations. Quite generally, the earlier proposal that information in all sensory modalities can
be transformed to ﬁeld patterns represented by MEs could sharpen to the hypothesis that the
information in various sensory modalities allows a representation as dark photon beams inducing
corresponding sensory qualia in the interaction with appropriate sensory receptors.
What is the mechanism causing the kinesthetic sensations during OBEs?
The model should also explain sensations of lifting, ﬂying experiences, and the experiences of
being in translational or rotational motion. The motion of the magnetic body with respect to
the physical body should induce this kind of sensations. The basic idea is simple: generalize
the mechanism allowing to hear the motion of a sound source. Generalizing from sound waves
to dark photon beams, the sensation in question would be basically due to the Doppler shift of
the dark photon beams travelling between biological body and the moving magnetic body. The
change of the dynamical hologram resulting in the interference of a bodily reference beam and
Doppler shifted reﬂected beam in quantum jumps could be responsible for the sensation.
This model could also resolve an objection against the hypothesis that sensory receptors experi-
ence the primary qualia. The objection is based on train illusion. When you sit on a train and

626
Chapter 12. TGD Based Model for OBEs
look at second train which starts to move, you can have an illusion that it is your train that
moves. The illusion is not a mere belief but involves a sensation of acceleration in the entire
body. There are two options.
(a) The sensation is a response to various bodily activities induced by the belief of being in
an accelerated motion.
(b) The sensation is caused by a primary sensory input induced by the acceleration. This
sensory input must be produced artiﬁcially in the case of train illusion.
Consider ﬁrst a genuine accelerated motion of the biological body. One could argue that in
absence of visual, auditory or other sensory information about being in accelerated motion,
there is no belief about being in accelerated motion so that acceleration is not perceived at all
for option a). This makes option a) implausible. For option b) the acceleration of the biological
body with respect to the object deﬁning the rest system is directly perceived. The Doppler shift
of the dark photon beams radiated from biological body and reﬂected back from the rest system
would induce the sensation. Reﬂection could occur either from the rest system or a magnetic
body associated with it.
One can imagine two mechanisms creating an illusory acceleration for option b).
(a) If the ﬁxation of the attention to the moving train means the presence of dark photon
laser beams connecting biological body and train or a magnetic body associated with it,
the Doppler shift of dark photon beams could induce the sensation of acceleration.
(b) Directed attention could cause a personal magnetic body to mimic the motion of train so
that the relevant part of it deforms in the direction of moving train to keep the distance
to the moving train ﬁxed. This would induce train illusion by the same mechanism as in
case 1).
For both mechanisms the reﬂection of dark photon beams becomes the fundamental mechanism
of directed attention. Attention would mean a formation very concrete bonds between subject
and object or a representation of object at the personal magnetic body: the rays connecting
the eyes of cartoon characters would represent a very profound idea about consciousness. Both
views about attention mean a clear-cut deviation from the prevailing neuro-scientiﬁc thinking
according to which the experienced world is virtual and completely detached from the real world.
Cliﬀillusion might be an appropriate name for the disgusting feeling in stomach which one feels
on the brink of a precipice. Sensory imagination about falling down is in question and could be
induced by the deformation of the personal magnetic body such that it mimics free fall.
The ﬂoating sensations and strange deformations of personal body during OBEs could also
correspond to the deformation dynamics of the magnetic body which could be also caused
by external inﬂuences. If the size of the magnetic body is measured using Earth radius as a
natural unit and if the personal magnetic body co-rotates with Earth, the variation of the eﬀect
of the solar wind could induce periodic deformations of the magnetic body as in the case of
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. This could reﬂect itself as diurnal alterations in the shape of the body
experienced during OBEs: a contraction during day time and an elongation during night time.
Sunspot maxima induce magnetic storms and these could have strong eﬀects on the shape of
the body perceived during OBEs.
What is the mechanism making possible to see internal organs?
Becker tells in his book ”Cross currents” [J29] about a young cancer patient who told that he
can see the interior of his own body. The patient could also locate the remnant of the tumor
correctly. The simplest explanation is that magnetic body at some level of hierarchy reﬂects the
dark photons emitted by the internal organs.
Usually this does not occur and one should understand why the emission occurred in the case of
the cancer patient. There is evidence that bio-photons leak out from non-healthy organs [I13]

12.2. TGD inspired model for OBEs
627
: this might mean that organs send more intense dark photon beams reﬂected at the magnetic
body.
Time mirror mechanism involving time reﬂection instead of ordinary reﬂection suggests itself
as an alternative explanation. The cells suﬀering starvation generated phase conjugate dark
photon beams in order to get metabolic energy. This in turn induced a cascade like emission of
positive energy dark photon beams from the magnetic body instead of mere time reﬂection.
12.2.5
The role of the magnetic body in the case of other brain func-
tions
During the construction of the model of OBEs it became clear that the reﬂection of dark photon
beams from the magnetic body could serve as a building block of several ordinary brain functions.
If has been already found that dark photon beams could deﬁne a fundamental mechanism of
directed attention.
Dreams and hallucinations and magnetic body
The reﬂection of dark photon beams from the magnetic body could be involved also with dreams
and hallucinations so that the neurological similarity of AS experiences and OBEs does not mean
that both are hallucinatory. The ”subtle body” assigned by many spiritual traditions with the
dreaming state (for a nice summary see [J138] ) would correspond to the magnetic body. In this
case mental images constructed in brain would induce dark photon beams sent to magnetic body
and reﬂected back. The mechanism would also naturally explain autoscopic and heautoscopic
experiences, in particular the ability to see internal organs.
The relationship of EMDR experiences to OBEs
Near-death experiences are not the only manner to get convinced about life after death. So called
eye-movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) discovered by Francine Shapiro [J40]
induces what could be interpreted as after-death communications (see the discussion in [K63]
). The experiences of subject persons are claimed to be induced by this therapy in a highly
reliable manner: according to [J40] 98 per cent of patients willing to participate the therapy had
after death communication experience. It does not matter what the religious convictions of the
subject person are and the experiences are actually rather easy to induce. It does not matter if
the loss is traumatic or not or whether it is recent or occurred for decades in past.
The experiences resemble near death experiences (light tunnels, beautiful landscapes) and involve
spiritual contact with the deceased. The EMDR technique involves getting the patient to move
his or her eyes in a particular rhythmic fashion while at the same time attending to a particular
aspect of the traumatic memory. How EMRD works is poorly understood as yet: possibly the
fact that the shifting of eyes leads to increased brain processing is of importance. Notice that
rapid eye movements REM are also involved with dreams.
A possible explanation is that EMDR experiences involves visual communication using dark
photon beams and/or their phase conjugates with the 4-D magnetic bodies of the deceased
ones located possibly in the geometric recent or past via the magnetic mirrors associated with
them. Essentially the same mechanism as involved with long term episodal memories could be
in question: the only diﬀerence would be that the magnetic mirrors now mediate information
not from own 4-D body from the 4-D body of the deceased.
Third person aspect of conscious experience
Our conscious experience involves so called third person aspect giving a symbolic bird’s eye of
view about ourselves. Magnetic body could could take the role of the third person. At the
fundamental level this representation could be based on sensory stimuli originating from body
and reﬂected back to sensory organs. It would be completely masked by the ordinary sensory

628
Chapter 12. TGD Based Model for OBEs
input in wake-up state but distilled by brain from the dominating sensory input and coded to a
cognitive representation to minimize the amount of irrelevant information. A strong interference
of this kind of sensory representation with ordinary sensory input would be obviously highly
undesirable. The third person aspect could be present always and be based on the reﬂection of
dark photons along MEs paralle to magnetic ﬂux tubes.
Feedback to primary sensory organs via reﬂection from magnetic body
One objection against the hypothesis that primary sensory organs are seats of sensory qualia is
that that sensory stimuli are only the raw material sculptured into actual sensory perceptions
and that directed attention chooses what aspects of sensory stimulus are ampliﬁed and which
neglected.
I have proposed that there is a feedback by projections to the primary sensory
organs from brain generating artiﬁcial sensory stimuli modifying the primary sensory input.
This feedback could be realized also as a reﬂection of artiﬁcial dark photon beams generated by
brain from the magnetic body and received as such by eyes or received by brain and channelled
to eyes via MEs parallel to visual pathways.
Does imagination involve feedback via magnetic body?
One can wonder, whether also imagination could involve reﬂection of dark photon beams from the
magnetic body. In TGD framework the hypothesis that sensory qualia are generated at primary
sensory organs and brain constructs only symbolic representations about experiences circumvents
the basic objections such as the experience of phantom leg. In this framework imagination and
cognition can be identiﬁed as symbol generating activities which are not initiated at sensory
organs but at some higher level of the hierarchy starting from sensory organs and ending at the
associative areas of cortex.
Imagination could however involve also transformation of symbolic representations to dark pho-
ton beams reﬂected back from the magnetic body. This input would not contribute to sensory
input but might be abstracted from the sensory input and might serve as a kind of feedback.
In absence of ordinary sensory stimuli the input from the magnetic body would dominate and
imagined mental images would transform to dreams or hallucinations.
Sensory memories and magnetic body
In some exceptional cases often associated with a serious damage in cognitive areas of brain the
feedback from the magnetic body could give rise to a genuine sensory representation making
possible direct sensory memories. Examples are autistic persons with ability to remember visual
scenes music pieces in every detail and also reproduce them.
One explanation is sharing of sensory mental images of geometric past. An alternative explana-
tion is that the information about sensory memory is communicated from the geometric past in
symbolic form and transformed to a dark photon beam reﬂected back from the magnetic body.
The fact that angular gyrus is involved with the translation of written language to internal
speech and the abstraction of meaning of visual metaphors supports the view that a transforma-
tion of linguistic statements to concrete images projected to the magnetic body occurs in this
process.
I have proposed a mechanism [K64] explaining synesthesia. The association of diﬀerent sensory
modalities could also occur via a transformation of sensory input in given modality to dark
photon beam reﬂected from magnetic body and generating a sensation in another modality.
Synesthetes are also known to be capable of amazing sensory memory feats [J48] and I have
proposed an explanation based on time mirror mechanism [K64] . Also in this case neurons
in certain region of left brain hemisphere suﬀer starvation which should be lethal by standard
wisdom.
As a matter fact, the starvation mechanism seems to be a very general mechanism: Callahan
has found evidence that insects ﬁnd more easily the plants suﬀering from under nutrition [I9]

12.3. The interpretation of my own OBE type experiences in terms of the proposed
model
629
(see the discussion in [K31] ). Even the fasting common in spiritual practices could be seen as
a method to get body entangled with magnetic bodies by using time mirror mechanism.
12.3
The interpretation of my own OBE type experiences
in terms of the proposed model
My own personal experiences have served as a test bed for the basic ideas of TGD inspired
theory of consciousness. I ﬁnd it practical to divide these experiences into two classes. The ﬁrst
class of experiences have repeated relatively often during years after the great experiences. The
Great Experiences in turn involved a rich spectrum of experiences which I group into the second
class. There is some overlap between these categories.
12.3.1
Visual experiences and kinesthetic sensations
The ﬁrst class of strange experiences involves several kinds of visual experiences and kinesthetic
sensations.
(a) When I lightly close my eyes during ordinary wake-up consciousness and in calm state
of mind, I see dimly a complex ﬂow in the visual ﬁeld. This ﬂow brings in mind time
dependent magnetic ﬁeld or incompressible ﬂow of ﬂuid. The direction of ﬂow can be either
inwards or outwards and can change. The ﬂow can be also colored. The straightforward
interpretation would be as a visual stimulus from the magnetic body which does not give
rise to concrete images.
(b) I have had many AS experiences in which I have seen my body in strangely deformed state
and have had a sensation of ﬂoating. This experience is often followed by the experience
of raising to the roof and I have made attempts to test whether the levitation is real or
not. The experiences have ended to a wake-up to ordinary state of consciousness. Quite
concrete sensations of what I have identiﬁed as ”electrical storms in temporal lobes” have
often accompanied these experiences.
(c) I have had also ﬂying experiences: typically there is some critical height which I cannot
exceed. I have had also experiences about being in completely dissipation free spinning or
translational motion, which bring strongly in mind what purely quantal motions of this
kind feel like. The translational motion has been possible only in a ﬁnite volume deﬁned
typically by the walls of the room. I have also experienced my children to bring me back
when I have tried to go too far. A possible interpretation is that my magnetic body is
bound to that of room so that it is not possible to leave it.
(d) I have often experienced quite concretely a return to my own body during wake-up as a kind
of contraction somewhat like djinn returning to a bottle. After a visit to Holland where
I was subject to a treatment by a healer, I waked up to a rather long-lasting experience
in which I felt that the entire room was part of my body. The world around me was
strangely peaceful and calm, somewhat like the world in the pictures I saw in fairy tales
in my childhood.
(e) Two illusions analogous to train illusion but involving a 2- or 3-dimensional wave motion
instead of linear motion deserve also to be mentioned. I sat in a calm state of mind on
cliﬀon beach and enjoyed looking the waves.
Suddenly I got a long lasting sensation
that the cliﬀis in a wave like motion as if I had seen the cliﬀfrom the perspective of
the moving surface of sea and thus in a wave like movement with respect to it.
The
explanation would be magnetic body began to mimic the wave motion somewhat like a
person listening very attentively begins to mimic the facial expressions of the speaker.
Since magnetic body also serves also the dual role of a sensory canvas to which sensory
mental images are projected [K37] , the situation would be like projecting sensory mental
images to a deformable screen along which deformation waves propagate. The projected
sensory images such as the visual image about cliﬀwould inherit the wavy character.

630
Chapter 12. TGD Based Model for OBEs
Anyone who has enjoyed free ﬂoating in a windy sea for a suﬃciently long time has probably
experienced a sensation about a wave like motion inside the body after the return to the shore.
The sensation continues surprisingly long time. As far as I can remember, this experience is
absent during free ﬂoating. Also this experience might relate to the ﬁxation of bodily attention
to the wavy sea inducing a mimicry of wave motion by a relevant magnetic body as in the
previous case and continuing for a considerable time after the return to the shore. During free
ﬂoating in sea this sensation is weak since the relative motion is minimal but at the shore the
situation changes since the body is in a relative 3-D motion with respect to the magnetic body.
12.3.2
OBE type auditory sensations
Also OBE type auditory sensations have often occurred.
(a) The AS experience have often started usually by a gradual ampliﬁcation of sounds such
as the sound of refrigerator and have involved the rather frightening sensation that the
refrigerator attracts me towards it and wants to fuse my self with its own (for this reason I
have been forced to minimize this sound). A possible explanation is that magnetic body in
this kind of situation contributes to the auditory stimulus the secondary sound representing
the sensory stimulus that it has received from the body and a positive feedback loop is
generated. Representation as microwaves is perhaps the most plausible option.
(b) When I wake up during night-time, I can sometimes hear a kind of wind blowing and often
I realize that ordinary wind is not in question when I see that there is completely calm
outside. This wind has preceded sometimes a loss of consciousness. A microwave stimulus
arriving from magnetic body along magnetic ﬂux tubes and transformed to auditory sen-
sation could be in question. Obviously this sensation would be direct auditory counterpart
for the ﬂow in visual ﬁeld experienced during wake-up.
(c) To listen one’s own snoring during sleep or just before wake-up as an outsider is a rather
bizarre experience and often it takes time to realize that it is really me. The interpretation
in terms of microwave dark photon beams modulated by the snoring and reﬂected back
from the magnetic body would be the simplest one.
(d) Sometimes I also hear my own breathing as double with a time laps of a fraction of second
between the copies. This gives some idea about size of the magnetic body possibly involved.
For microwave hearing the size of magnetic body would correspond to a wavelength of
typical EEG wave and would be of the order of Earth circumference for 7.8 Hz. If ordinary
sound waves are in question the size of magnetic body involve would be of order 10 meters.
12.3.3
OBEs associated with ”Great Experiences”
Second group of experiences I had during what I call Great Experiences (two of them).
(a) I saw my thoughts as images superposed to the strange ﬂow already mentioned.
The
optimum situation was achieved which lightly closed eyes. This stimulated a conversation
with what I called Great Mind. I wrote ﬁrst my questions to monitor and experimentation
with the transformation of written words into visual images during great experience. This
would conform with the view that brain, perhaps angular gyrus, transforms written words
to visual symbols by generating dark photon beams reﬂected back from the magnetic body.
During the original experience I had a deep conviction that this visual representation is
an essential part of language and thinking.
At some stage I found that writing of my questions is not anymore necessary and I also
began to realize that the Great Mind in some sense is just me, in some sense I was a
God. One of the most important answers I received was that death is only an illusion.
An interpretation in terms of a direct communication with some magnetic body in the
hierarchy, not necessarily mine, looks natural.

12.3. The interpretation of my own OBE type experiences in terms of the proposed
model
631
(b) I experienced several variants of OBEs. There was an heautoscopic experience in which I
did not only see me as an outsider but experienced how my body language directly reveals
to an outsider my sociophoby.
During the stay in hospital I left my body and walked out from hospital. I was surprised
that the personnel did not notice this at all, as if I had been invisible. I walked along
sunny street (it was very beautiful day of May) and felt myself extremely happy. I did
not get too far since persons from the staﬀof hospital brought me back. This might be
an example of experience involving remote viewing in which magnetic body reﬂects dark
photons from external world to the physical body. Again it would seem that my magnetic
body was bound to some larger one and could not leave it.
There was also an experience of wandering in worlds totally diﬀerent from our physical
world. Learning that this kind of worlds exist was a little bit irritating for my theoretician’s
vanity since I had thought that the ordinary physical universe predicted by TGD is all
that exists!
Finally there was experience that the hospital building itself is a conscious entity having
some kind of experiences and that I had somehow identiﬁed with it or that I somehow
received visual information about the structure of the building.
(c) During second Great Experience I experienced what might be called tactile remote sensing.
I ”saw” at the skin of my leg an emotionally highly painful event and interpreted it
as remote viewing. This would support the view that also tactile sensations might be
generated by dark photons in some wave length range. Hearing and tactile sensing are
indeed closely related.
It is perhaps not an accident that during OBE like experiences I saw my thoughts as vivid
pictures and that people experiencing OBEs are known to have exceptionally vivid visual imag-
ination. This might relate to redirected metabolism. Construction of mental images and their
communication requires metabolic energy feed.
During OBEs the metabolic energy usually
spent to the formation and communication of the cognitive representations about the state of
the biological body to the magnetic body could be redirected to the visual cortex allowing to
construct the vivid visual representations of thoughts. The distorted bodily image due to neural
disorders in temporal lobes seems to correlate with OBEs: perhaps the disorder does not allow
metabolic energy to be used to construct cognitive representations about biological body during
these disorders and it is redirected to the visual cortex. Also during dreams and in the transition
states between sleep and awake the metabolic resources could be redirected in this manner and
lead to a generation of vivid visual mental images.

CP2 as a manifold
CP2, the complex projective space of two complex dimensions, is obtained by identifying the
points of complex 3-space C3 under the projective equivalence
(z1, z2, z3) ≡λ(z1, z2, z3) .
(A-1.1)
Here λ is any non-zero complex number. Note that CP2 can be also regarded as the coset space
SU(3)/U(2). The pair zi/zj for ﬁxed j and zi ̸= 0 deﬁnes a complex coordinate chart for CP2.
As j runs from 1 to 3 one obtains an atlas of three oordinate charts covering CP2, the charts
being holomorphically related to each other (e.g. CP2 is a complex manifold). The points z3 ̸= 0
form a subset of CP2 homeomorphic to R4 and the points with z3 = 0 a set homeomorphic to
S2. Therefore CP2 is obtained by ”adding the 2-sphere at inﬁnity to R4”.
Besides the standard complex coordinates ξi = zi/z3 , i = 1, 2 the coordinates of Eguchi and
Freund [A25] will be used and their relation to the complex coordinates is given by
ξ1
=
z + it ,
ξ2
=
x + iy .
(A-1.2)
These are related to the ”spherical coordinates” via the equations

2
)cos(Θ
2 ) ,
ξ2
=
rexp(i(Ψ −Φ)
2
)sin(Θ
2 ) .
(A-1.3)
The ranges of the variables r, Θ, Φ, Ψ are [0, ∞], [0, π], [0, 4π], [0, 2π] respectively.
Considered as a real four-manifold CP2 is compact and simply connected, with Euler number
Euler number 3, Pontryagin number 3 and second b = 1.

Metric and K¨ahler structure of CP2
In order to obtain a natural metric for CP2, observe that CP2 can be thought of as a set of the
orbits of the isometries zi →exp(iα)zi on the sphere S5: P zi¯zi = R2. The metric of CP2 is
obtained by projecting the metric of S5 orthogonally to the orbits of the isometries. Therefore
the distance between the points of CP2 is that between the representative orbits on S5.
The line element has the following form in the complex coordinates
ds2
=
ga¯bdξad¯ξb ,
(A-1.4)
where the Hermitian, in fact K¨ahler metric ga¯b is deﬁned by
ga¯b

R2∂a∂¯bK ,
(A-1.5)
where the function K, K¨ahler function, is deﬁned as
K

log(F) ,
F

(A-1.6)
The K¨ahler function for S2 has the same form. It gives the S2 metric dzdz/(1+r2)2 related to its
standard form in spherical coordinates by the coordinate transformation (r, φ) = (tan(θ/2), φ).
The representation of the CP2 metric is deducible from S5 metric is obtained by putting the
angle coordinate of a geodesic sphere constant in it and is given

K¨ahler form J deﬁnes in CP2 a symplectic structure because it
satisﬁes the condition
Jk

(A-1.17)
The form J is integer valued and by its covariant constancy satisﬁes free Maxwell equations.
Hence it can be regarded as a curvature form of a U(1) gauge potential B carrying a magnetic
charge of unit 1/2g (g denotes the gauge coupling). Locally one has therefore
J
=
dB ,
(A-1.18)

636
Chapter 1. Appendix
where B is the so called K¨ahler potential, which is not deﬁned globally since J describes homo-
logical magnetic monopole.
It should be noticed that the magnetic ﬂux of J through a 2-surface in CP2 is proportional to
its homology equivalence class, which is integer valued. The explicit representations of J and B
are given by

The vierbein curvature form and K¨ahler form are covariantly constant and have in the complex
coordinates only components of type (1,1).

A-1.3
Spinors in CP2
CP2 doesn’t allow spinor structure in the conventional sense [A17] . However, the coupling of
the spinors to a half odd multiple of the K¨ahler potential leads to a respectable spinor structure.
Because the delicacies associated with the spinor structure of CP2 play a fundamental role in
TGD, the arguments of Hawking are repeated here.
To see how the space can fail to have an ordinary spinor structure consider the parallel transport
of the vierbein in a simply connected space M. The parallel propagation around a closed curve
with a base point x leads to a rotated vierbein at x: eA = RA
BeB and one can associate to each
closed path an element of SO(4).
Consider now a one-parameter family of closed curves γ(v) : v ∈(0, 1) with the same base point
x and γ(0) and γ(1) trivial paths. Clearly these paths deﬁne a sphere S2 in M and the element
RA
B(v) deﬁnes a closed path in SO(4).
When the sphere S2 is contractible to a point e.g.,
homologically trivial, the path in SO(4) is also contractible to a point and therefore represents
a trivial element of the homotopy group Π1(SO(4)) = Z2.
For a homologically nontrivial 2-surface S2 the associated path in SO(4) can be homotopically
nontrivial and therefore corresponds to a nonclosed path in the covering group Spin(4) (leading
from the matrix 1 to -1 in the matrix representation). Assume this is the case.

A-2. CP2 geometry and standard model symmetries
637
Assume now that the space allows spinor structure. Then one can parallel propagate also spinors
and by the above construction associate a closed path of Spin(4) to the surface S2. Now, however
this path corresponds to a lift of the corresponding SO(4) path and cannot be closed. Thus one
ends up with a contradiction.
From the preceding argument it is clear that one could compensate the non-allowed −1- factor
associated with the parallel transport of the spinor around the sphere S2 by coupling it to a
gauge potential in such a way that in the parallel transport the gauge potential introduces a
compensating −1-factor. For a U(1) gauge potential this factor is given by the exponential
exp(i2Φ) , where Φ is the magnetic ﬂux through the surface. This factor has the value −1
provided the U(1) potential carries half odd multiple of Dirac charge 1/2g. In case of CP2 the
required gauge potential is half odd multiple of the K¨ahler potential B deﬁned previously. In
the case of M 4 ×CP2 one can in addition couple the spinor components with diﬀerent chiralities
independently to an odd multiple of B/2.
A-1.4
Geodesic sub-manifolds of CP2
Geodesic sub-manifolds are deﬁned as sub-manifolds having common geodesic lines with the
imbedding space.
As a consequence the second fundamental form of the geodesic manifold
vanishes, which means that the tangent vectors hk
α (understood as vectors of H) are covariantly
constant quantities with respect to the covariant derivative taking into account that the tangent
vectors are vectors both with respect to H and X4.
In [A8] a general characterization of the geodesic sub-manifolds for an arbitrary symmetric space
G/H is given. Geodesic sub-manifolds are in 1-1-correspondence with the so called Lie triple
systems of the Lie-algebra g of the group G. The Lie triple system t is deﬁned as a subspace of
g characterized by the closedness property with respect to double commutation
[X, [Y, Z]] ∈t for X, Y, Z ∈t .
(A-1.22)
SU(3) allows, besides geodesic lines, two nonequivalent (not isometry related) geodesic spheres.
This is understood by observing that SU(3) allows two nonequivalent SU(2) algebras corre-
sponding to subgroups SO(3) (orthogonal 3 × 3 matrices) and the usual isospin group SU(2).
By taking any subset of two generators from these algebras, one obtains a Lie triple system and
by exponentiating this system, one obtains a 2-dimensional geodesic sub-manifold of CP2.
Standard representatives for the geodesic spheres of CP2 are given by the equations
S2
I
:
ξ1 = ¯ξ2 or equivalently (Θ = π/2, Ψ = 0) ,
S2
II
:
ξ1 = ξ2 or equivalently (Θ = π/2, Φ = 0) .
The non-equivalence of these sub-manifolds is clear from the fact that isometries act as holo-
morphic transformations in CP2. The vanishing of the second fundamental form is also easy
to verify. The ﬁrst geodesic manifold is homologically trivial: in fact, the induced K¨ahler form
vanishes identically for S2
I . S2
II is homologically nontrivial and the ﬂux of the K¨ahler form gives
its homology equivalence class.

Identiﬁcation of the electro-weak couplings
The delicacies of the spinor structure of CP2 make it a unique candidate for space S. First, the
coupling of the spinors to the U(1) gauge potential deﬁned by the K¨ahler structure provides the

638
Chapter 1. Appendix
missing U(1) factor in the gauge group. Secondly, it is possible to couple diﬀerent H-chiralities
independently to a half odd multiple of the K¨ahler potential. Thus the hopes of obtaining a
correct spectrum for the electromagnetic charge are considerable. In the following it will be
demonstrated that the couplings of the induced spinor connection are indeed those of the GWS
model [B12] and in particular that the right handed neutrinos decouple completely from the
electro-weak interactions.
To begin with, recall that the space H allows to deﬁne three diﬀerent chiralities for spinors.
Spinors with ﬁxed H-chirality e = ±1, CP2-chirality l, r and M 4-chirality L, R are deﬁned by
the condition
ΓΨ
=
eΨ ,
e
=
±1 ,
(A-2.1)
where Γ denotes the matrix Γ9 = γ5 × γ5, 1 × γ5 and γ5 × 1 respectively. Clearly, for a ﬁxed
H-chirality CP2- and M 4-chiralities are correlated.
The spinors with H-chirality e = ±1 can be identiﬁed as quark and lepton like spinors re-
spectively. The separate conservation of baryon and lepton numbers can be understood as a
consequence of generalized chiral invariance if this identiﬁcation is accepted. For the spinors
with a deﬁnite H-chirality one can identify the vielbein group of CP2 as the electro-weak group:
SO(4) = SU(2)L × SU(2)R.
The covariant derivatives are deﬁned by the spinorial connection
A
=
V + B
2 (n+1+ + n−1−) .
(A-2.2)
Here V and B denote the projections of the vielbein and K¨ahler gauge potentials respectively and
1+(−) projects to the spinor H-chirality +(−). The integers n± are odd from the requirement
of a respectable spinor structure.
The explicit representation of the vielbein connection V and of B are given by the equations

and

respectively. The explicit representation of the vielbein is not needed here.
Let us ﬁrst show that the charged part of the spinor connection couples purely left handedly.
Identifying Σ0
3 and Σ1
2 as the diagonal (neutral) Lie-algebra generators of SO(4), one ﬁnds that
the charged part of the spinor connection is given by
Ach
=
2V23I1
L + 2V13I2
L ,

where one have deﬁned

(A-2.6)
Ach is clearly left handed so that one can perform the identiﬁcation
W ±
=
2(e1 ± ie2)
r
,
(A-2.7)
where W ± denotes the charged intermediate vector boson.
Consider next the identiﬁcation of the neutral gauge bosons γ and Z0 as appropriate linear
combinations of the two functionally independent quantities
X
=
re3 ,
Y
=
e3
r
,
(A-2.8)
appearing in the neutral part of the spinor connection. We show ﬁrst that the mere requirement
that photon couples vectorially implies the basic coupling structure of the GWS model leaving
only the value of Weinberg angle undetermined.
To begin with let us deﬁne
¯γ
=
aX + bY ,
¯Z0
=
cX + dY ,
(A-2.9)
where the normalization condition
ad −bc = 1 ,
is satisﬁed. The physical ﬁelds γ and Z0 are related to ¯γ and ¯Z0 by simple normalization factors.
Expressing the neutral part of the spinor connection in term of these ﬁelds one obtains
Anc
=
[(c + d)2Σ03 + (2d −c)2Σ12 + d(n+1+ + n−1−)]¯γ
+
[(a −b)2Σ03 + (a −2b)2Σ12 −b(n+1+ + n−1−)] ¯Z0 .
(A-2.10)
Identifying Σ12 and Σ03 = 1 × γ5Σ12 as vectorial and axial Lie-algebra generators, respectively,
the requirement that γ couples vectorially leads to the condition
c
=
−d .
(A-2.11)
Using this result plus previous equations, one obtains for the neutral part of the connection the
expression

The value of the Weinberg angle is given by
sin2θW
=
3b
2(a + b) ,
(A-2.15)
and is not ﬁxed completely. Observe that right handed neutrinos decouple completely from the
electro-weak interactions.
The determination of the value of Weinberg angle is a dynamical problem. The angle is com-
pletely ﬁxed once the YM action is ﬁxed by requiring that action contains no cross term of
type γZ0. Pure symmetry non-broken electro-weak YM action leads to a deﬁnite value for the
Weinberg angle. One can however add a symmetry breaking term proportional to K¨ahler action
and this changes the value of the Weinberg angle.
To evaluate the value of the Weinberg angle one can express the neutral part Fnc of the induced
gauge ﬁeld as
Fnc
=
2R03Σ03 + 2R12Σ12 + J(n+1+ + n−1−) ,
(A-2.16)
where one has
R03
=
2(2e0 ∧e3 + e1 ∧e2) ,
R12
=
2(e0 ∧e3 + 2e1 ∧e2) ,
J

in terms of the ﬁelds γ and Z0 (photon and Z- boson)
Fnc
=
γQem + Z0(I3

Discrete symmetries
The treatment of discrete symmetries C, P, and T is based on the following requirements:
a) Symmetries must be realized as purely geometric transformations.
b) Transformation properties of the ﬁeld variables should be essentially the same as in the
conventional quantum ﬁeld theories [B5] .
The action of the reﬂection P on spinors of is given by
Ψ
→
PΨ = γ0 ⊗γ0Ψ .
(A-2.26)
in the representation of the gamma matrices for which γ0 is diagonal. It should be noticed that
W and Z0 bosons break parity symmetry as they should since their charge matrices do not
commute with the matrix of P.
The guess that a complex conjugation in CP2 is associated with T transformation of the physicist
turns out to be correct. One can verify by a direct calculation that pure Dirac action is invariant
under T realized according to
mk

ξk

metrically to complex conjugation in CP2:

As one might have expected symmetries CP and T are exact symmetries of the pure Dirac
action.

Basic facts about induced gauge ﬁelds
Since the classical gauge ﬁelds are closely related in TGD framework, it is not possible to have
space-time sheets carrying only single kind of gauge ﬁeld. For instance, em ﬁelds are accompanied
by Z0 ﬁelds for extremals of K¨ahler action. Weak forces is however absent unless the space-time
sheets contains topologically condensed exotic weakly charged particles responding to this force.
Same applies to classical color forces. The fact that these long range ﬁelds are present forces to
assume that there exists a hierarchy of scaled up variants of standard model physics identiﬁable
in terms of dark matter.
Classical em ﬁelds are always accompanied by Z0 ﬁeld and some components of color gauge ﬁeld.
For extremals having homologically non-trivial sphere as a CP2 projection em and Z0 ﬁelds are
the only non-vanishing electroweak gauge ﬁelds. For homologically trivial sphere only W ﬁelds
are non-vanishing. Color rotations does not aﬀect the situation.
For vacuum extremals all electro-weak gauge ﬁelds are in general non-vanishing although the net
gauge ﬁeld has U(1) holonomy by 2-dimensionality of the CP2 projection. Color gauge ﬁeld has
U(1) holonomy for all space-time surfaces and quantum classical correspondence suggest a weak
form of color conﬁnement meaning that physical states correspond to color neutral members of
color multiplets.

A-3. Basic facts about induced gauge ﬁelds
643
A-3.1
Induced gauge ﬁelds for space-times for which CP2 projection
is a geodesic sphere
If one requires that space-time surface is an extremal of K¨ahler action and has a 2-dimensional
CP2 projection, only vacuum extremals and space-time surfaces for which CP2 projection is a
geodesic sphere, are allowed. Homologically non-trivial geodesic sphere correspond to vanishing
W ﬁelds and homologically non-trivial sphere to non-vanishing W ﬁelds but vanishing γ and
Z0. This can be veriﬁed by explicit examples.
r = ∞surface gives rise to a homologically non-trivial geodesic sphere for which e0 and e3
vanish imply the vanishing of W ﬁeld. For space-time sheets for which CP2 projection is r = ∞
homologically non-trivial geodesic sphere of CP2 one has
γ = (3
4 −sin2(θW )
2
)Z0 ≃5Z0
8
.
The induced W ﬁelds vanish in this case and they vanish also for all geodesic sphere obtained
by SU(3) rotation.
Im(ξ1) = Im(ξ2) = 0 corresponds to homologically trivial geodesic sphere. A more general
representative is obtained by using for the phase angles of standard complex CP2 coordinates
constant values. In this case e1 and e3 vanish so that the induced em, Z0, and K¨ahler ﬁelds
vanish but induced W ﬁelds are non-vanishing. This holds also for surfaces obtained by color
rotation.
Hence one can say that for non-vacuum extremals with 2-D CP2 projection color
rotations and weak symmetries commute.
A-3.2
Space-time surfaces with vanishing em, Z0, or K¨ahler ﬁelds
In the following the induced gauge ﬁelds are studied for general space-time surface without
assuming the extremal property. In fact, extremal property reduces the study to the study of
vacuum extremals and surfaces having geodesic sphere as a CP2 projection and in this sense the
following arguments are somewhat obsolete in their generality.
Space-times with vanishing em, Z0, or K¨ahler ﬁelds
The following considerations apply to a more general situation in which the homologically trivial
geodesic sphere and extremal property are not assumed. It must be emphasized that this case
is possible in TGD framework only for a vanishing K¨ahler ﬁeld.
Using spherical coordinates (r, Θ, Ψ, Φ) for CP2, the expression of K¨ahler form reads as
J
=
r
F 2 dr ∧(dΨ + cos(Θ)dΦ) + r2
2F sin(Θ)dΘ ∧dΦ ,
F
=
1 + r2 .
(A-3.1)
The general expression of electromagnetic ﬁeld reads as
Fem
=
(3 + 2p) r
F 2 dr ∧(dΨ + cos(Θ)dΦ) + (3 + p) r2
2F sin(Θ)dΘ ∧dΦ ,
p
=
sin2(ΘW ) ,
(A-3.2)
where ΘW denotes Weinberg angle.
a) The vanishing of the electromagnetic ﬁelds is guaranteed, when the conditions

hold true. The conditions imply that CP2 projection of the electromagnetically neutral space-
time is 2-dimensional. Solving the diﬀerential equation one obtains

(A-3.4)
where C and D are integration constants. 0 ≤X ≤1 is required by the reality of r. r = 0
would correspond to X = 0 giving u = −k achieved only for |k| ≤1 and r = ∞to X = 1 giving
|u + k| = [(1 + r2

sign(u + k) × [1 + r2

where sign(x) denotes the sign of x.
The expressions for K¨ahler form and Z0 ﬁeld are given by
J
=
−
p
3 + 2pXdu ∧dΦ ,
Z0
=

pJ .
(A-3.5)
The components of the electromagnetic ﬁeld generated by varying vacuum parameters are pro-
portional to the components of the K¨ahler ﬁeld: in particular, the magnetic ﬁeld is parallel to
the K¨ahler magnetic ﬁeld. The generation of a long range Z0 vacuum ﬁeld is a purely TGD
based feature not encountered in the standard gauge theories.
b) The vanishing of Z0 ﬁelds is achieved by the replacement of the parameter ϵ with ϵ = 1/2 as
becomes clear by considering the condition stating that Z0 ﬁeld vanishes identically. Also the
relationship Fem = 3J = −3
4
r2
F du ∧dΦ is useful.
c) The vanishing K¨ahler ﬁeld corresponds to ϵ = 1, p = 0 in the formula for em neutral space-
times. In this case classical em and Z0 ﬁelds are proportional to each other:
Z0
=
2e0 ∧e3 = r
F 2 (k + u) ∂r
∂udu ∧dΦ = (k + u)du ∧dΦ ,
r
=
r
X
1 −X , X = D|k + u| ,
γ
=
−p
2Z0 .
(A-3.6)
For a vanishing value of Weinberg angle (p = 0) em ﬁeld vanishes and only Z0 ﬁeld remains as
a long range gauge ﬁeld. Vacuum extremals for which long range Z0 ﬁeld vanishes but em ﬁeld
is non-vanishing are not possible.

The eﬀective form of CP2 metric for surfaces with 2-dimensional CP2 projection
The eﬀective form of the CP2 metric for a space-time having vanishing em,Z0, or K¨ahler ﬁeld
is of practical value in the case of vacuum extremals and is given by
ds2

(A-3.7)
and is useful in the construction of vacuum imbedding of, say Schwartchild metric.
Topological quantum numbers
Space-times for which either em, Z0, or K¨ahler ﬁeld vanishes decompose into regions charac-
terized by six vacuum parameters: two of these quantum numbers (ω1 and ω2) are frequency
type parameters, two (k1 and k2 ) are wave vector like quantum numbers, two of the quantum
numbers (n1 and n2) are integers. The parameters ωi and ni will be referred as electric and
magnetic quantum numbers. The existence of these quantum numbers is not a feature of these
solutions alone but represents a much more general phenomenon diﬀerentiating in a clear cut
manner between TGD and Maxwell’s electrodynamics.
The simplest manner to avoid surface K¨ahler charges and discontinuities or inﬁnities in the
derivatives of CP2 coordinates on the common boundary of two neighboring regions with diﬀerent
vacuum quantum numbers is topological ﬁeld quantization, 3-space decomposes into disjoint
topological ﬁeld quanta, 3-surfaces having outer boundaries with possibly macroscopic size.
Under rather general conditions the coordinates Ψ and Φ can be written in the form
Ψ
=
ω2m0 + k2m3 + n2φ + Fourier expansion ,
Φ
=
ω1m0 + k1m3 + n1φ + Fourier expansion .
(A-3.8)
m0,m3 and φ denote the coordinate variables of the cylindrical M 4 coordinates) so that one has
k = ω2/ω1 = n2/n1 = k2/k1. The regions of the space-time surface with given values of the
vacuum parameters ωi,ki and ni and m and C are bounded by the surfaces at which space-time
surface becomes ill-deﬁned, say by r > 0 or r < ∞surfaces.
The space-time surface decomposes into regions characterized by diﬀerent values of the vacuum
parameters r0 and Θ0.
At r = ∞surfaces n2,ω2 and m can change since all values of Ψ
correspond to the same point of CP2: at r = 0 surfaces also n1 and ω1 can change since all
values of Φ correspond to same point of CP2, too. If r = 0 or r = ∞is not in the allowed range
space-time surface develops a boundary.
This implies what might be called topological quantization since in general it is not possible to
ﬁnd a smooth global imbedding for, say a constant magnetic ﬁeld. Although global imbedding
exists it decomposes into regions with diﬀerent values of the vacuum parameters and the coor-
dinate u in general possesses discontinuous derivative at r = 0 and r = ∞surfaces. A possible
manner to avoid edges of space-time is to allow ﬁeld quantization so that 3-space (and ﬁeld)
decomposes into disjoint quanta, which can be regarded as structurally stable units a 3-space
(and of the gauge ﬁeld). This doesn’t exclude partial join along boundaries for neighboring ﬁeld
quanta provided some additional conditions guaranteing the absence of edges are satisﬁed.
For instance, the vanishing of the electromagnetic ﬁelds implies that the condition

Ω
≡
ω2
n2
−ω1
n1
= 0 ,
(A-3.9)
is satisﬁed. In particular, the ratio ω2/ω1 is rational number for the electromagnetically neutral
regions of space-time surface. The change of the parameter n1 and n2 (ω1 and ω2) in general
generates magnetic ﬁeld and therefore these integers will be referred to as magnetic (electric)
quantum numbers.
