Quantum Zeno Effect
Erich Joos
The Quantum Zeno Effect describes the slowing down of the evolution of a quantum
system under repeated measurements. In the limit of arbitrarily dense measurements
motion would be completely inhibited.
The now popular name “quantum Zeno effect” (or “Zeno paradox”) was in-
troduced by Misra and Sudarshan in 1977 [1]. The effect has been described
independently by many authors. (It can even be traced back to von Neumann’s
1932 treatise “Mathematical foundations of quantum theory”.) Other names used
are “Turing’s paradox”, “watched pot behavior”, or “watchdog effect”.
The quantum Zeno effect only appears “paradoxical” or surprising, if the in-
ﬂuence of measurements on a quantum system is not properly taken into account.
Many systems (in particular, exponentially decaying systems) are not inﬂuenced at
all by repeated measurements. This can be understood by a closer analysis of the
dynamics of repeated measurements [2].
Let a system be prepared in its “undecayed” state |u⟩at some initial instant t = 0.
Unitary evolution leads to a  superposition of this undecayed state with some
orthogonal (“decayed”) states |dk⟩, with amplitudes au and adk, respectively,

|(t)⟩= exp(−Ht) |u⟩
= au(t) |u⟩+

dk̸=u
adk(t) |dk⟩.
The (“survival”) probability of ﬁnding the system still “undecayed” (i.e. in the state
|u⟩) at a later time t > 0 is
P(t) = |au(t)|2
= | ⟨u| exp(−iHt) |u⟩|2.
Expanding the exponential in powers of t gives
P(t) = 1 −(H)2t2 + O(t4)
with
(H)2 = ⟨u| H 2 |u⟩−⟨u| H |u⟩2 .
If the measurement performed on the same unstable system is carried out not just
once, but is repeated N times in the interval [0, t], the probability that it will be
found undecayed in all N measurements is then given by
PN(t) ≈

> 1 −(H)2t2 = P(t).
The non-decay probability is always increased, that is, the decay is suppressed; in
the limit of arbitrarily dense measurements it comes to a complete halt,
PN(t) = 1 −(H)2 t2
N + . . .

−→1.
Thus under continuous measurement the system would not move at all.
A demonstration of the quantum Zeno effect was performed by Itano et al. in an
experiment [3] with Be+ ions conﬁned in a Penning trap (see Fig. 1).
In this setup the population of two levels is measured by coupling them to a third
atomic level which decays rapidly by emitting ﬂuorescence light. The ﬁrst two levels
represent the “measured object”, the third level together with the emitted photons
( light quantum) play the role of the measurement device.
As is evident from the above derivation of the quantum Zeno effect, the quadratic
time dependence of transition probabilities in the short-time limit is important [4, 5].
This approximation is valid for a sinusoidally oscillating system (as in the Itano
experiment), but may often be only a poor approximation.The most important coun-
terexample is represented by exponentially decaying systems, where it has long been
known that the quadratic limit holds only for a very short timescale (now sometimes
called Zeno time). Indeed, if the decay probability were exactly exponential,
P(t) = exp(−t),

Fig. 1 Level structure for an experiment demonstrating the quantum Zeno effect. The Rabi os-
cillations of the transition between levels 1 and 2 (driven by a resonant radiofrequency ﬁeld) are
monitored by exciting the optical transition 1 →3 resulting in light emission from level 3 through
spontaneous emission. In this way the 1 ↔3 transition together with the emitted light acts like a
(nearly ideal) measurement device discriminating between levels 1 and 2
there would be no Zeno effect at all, since trivially

Clearly, the Zeno effect is a consequence of measurement dynamics, again
emphazing the well-known fact that a quantum measurement cannot be simply
understood as information increase. A related discussion refers to the so-called
 interaction-free measurements [6], which in fact represent strong measurement-
like interaction and can be understood as a special case of the quantum Zeno effect
[7, 8]. One should also note, that “negative-result measurements” (where a measure-
ment device does not “ﬁre”) also contribute to the Zeno effect [9].
A more precise description of the dynamics behind the Zeno effect can be
achieved by replacing the phenomenological collapse rule by a dynamical model
for the measurement process [2,7,10,11,12]. From this perspective, the Zeno effect
can be viewed as the limiting case of very strong  decoherence, that is, very strong
measurement-like interaction of a quantum system with other degrees of freedom
[13]. ( Experimental observation of decoherence). Since decoherence destroys
phase relations at the system of interest, its motion (which in unitary quantum
theory completely relies on coherence) would come to a standstill, if coherence
were completely absent. If the density matrix ρ is exactly diagonal for all times,
ραβ = ρααδαβ, the von Neumann equation immediately yields Zeno freezing:

Q
Measurement models allow not only the discussion of the apparent contradiction
between Zeno effect and exponential decay (described by rate equations) [2], but
also a more realistic treatment of the small-time behavior, where system-dependent
features may lead to interesting effects (such as the so-called “anti-Zeno effect”
[7, 13].
The Zeno effect may ﬁnd application in the ﬁeld of quantum computing, where
it could possibly be used to constrain the motion of a system to certain subspaces of
its  Hilbert space [14]. It may also be of relevance for the stability of molecules,
where (already small) transition rates between spatial conﬁgurations may be further
reduced by the inﬂuence of the natural environment.
