that I expected to write, but it is the one that I believe needed to be written.The
original aim of my research was to reconstruct the language of the early Islamic
period,asseenthroughtranscriptionsof Arabicintonon-Arabicscript(primar-
ily Graeco-Arabica, Copto-Arabica, Sassano-Arabica, and Judeo-Arabic), and
comparingandcontrastingtheseagainsttheArabicinArabicscriptof theearly
Islamic period as found in the papyri and inscriptions.
WhileinthepastyearsIhavespentconsiderabletimeresearchingthisXeno-
Arabic material, as I have dubbed it, it quickly became clear to me that there
wasonecentrallinguisticsourceof earlyIslamicArabicwhichhadgonealmost
completely ignored: the Quran. Little to no research had been done into this
ancient linguistic source, without an implicit assumption that its reading tra-
ditions established at least a century later are an accurate reflection of the
language of its composition. This led me to decide to focus my research in this
direction, and this book is a culmination of my research of the past years bring-
ing together questions about the nature and origin of Classical Arabic, the part
that the Quran played in this, and the manner in which the Quranic reading
traditions arose.
There are many people whom I must thank, and without whose help this
work would not exist. Let me start with my dear friend Ahmad Al-Jallad. His
passion for the topic of Arabic historical linguistics is what drew me into the
field, his presence in Leiden is sorely missed. I wish to also thank Hythem
Sidky whose engagement with me on the topic of Quranic manuscripts and
the Qirāʔāt came at just the right time. Without our friendship and long dis-
cussions, this book would have been a very different and much weaker book.
There are many other colleagues whom I could thank for helping me think
through the topics of this book, but special mention should be made of Ben-
jamin Suchard, Fokelien Kootstra, Phillip Stokes, Imar Koutchoukali, Chams
Bernard and May Shaddel. This core group of dear friends and brilliant re-
searchers have supported me throughout this project and commented on the
many drafts of my chapter. I also thank my PhD supervisor and mentor, Prof.
Maarten Kossmann who continued to support and challenge me even as I tran-
sitioned from Berberology to this new field of Arabic linguistics and Quranic
studies, and whose critical and meticulous approach to anything scholarly con-
tinues to be a great inspiration to me.

helps me remember that there’s more to life than research. Last but not least, I
thank my mother and brother, and most of all my dear father who passed away

Transcription
Throughout this book, I use a transcription system of Arabic that needs to
be quite flexible as it covers a large amount of vowel representations that do
not necessarily occur in textbook Classical Arabic as we know it today, for
the consonants I have chosen to use a transcription that clearly distinguishes
hamzah (ʔ) and ʕayn (ʕ), and hamzah is always written, even when word-
initial, whereas the ʔalif al-waṣl is written without initial hamzah to denote
its elidable status. The table below illustrates my transcriptions in compari-
son to the dmg transcription system and its representation in international
phonetic alphabet in the phonetic representation that I believe most likely
matches the pronunciation in Quranic Arabic (see van Putten 2019b for more
details).

When transcribing Classical Arabic in running text, I will use pausal forms in
pause, context forms in context. When citing titles of books or names of peo-
ple, I will stick to the customary practice of using pausal forms throughout,
except in construct where I will use ʔiʕrāb-less forms. The feminine ending in
its pausal form is always spelled -ah and never, -a in line with its pronunciation
in careful Classical Arabic speech, as well as Quranic rhyme. Likewise, in run-
ning Classical Arabic text, I will transcribe the definite article as assimilating,
but in isolated citation of names and titles I will follow the common practice
of avoiding assimilation.
When transcribing Classical Arabic, the pronominal suffix -hu/-hi is tran-
scribed with vowel length disharmony, -hū/-hī after short vowels in line with
the normative pronunciation of Classical Arabic.
As for vowels, many more vowel qualities than the standard six (a, i, u, ā, ī,
ū) occur in our discussion. The table below gives their relative position, in the
vowel triangle, as well as the typical technical term for such a pronunciation.
Overlong vowels are written, where relevant, by doubling the long vowel: aḍ-

The Quran, Q12:2, in the reading of Ibn Kaṯīr
∵
1.1
Previous Scholarship
The main question the current book aims to answer is: “What is the language of
the Quran?” Despite more than a century of in-depth study of the Quran, and a
debateonthelinguisticnature,Ibelievethediscussiononthisquestionhasnot
progressed significantly, since Vollers (1906). Despite the many deficiencies of
Vollers’ work, which have already been addressed in detail especially by Nöld-
eke (1910), and Geyer (1909), I believe that the question it formulated remains
essential to furthering our understanding of the linguistic history of Arabic and
the context in which the Quran arose: What is the language of the Quran and,
perhaps more importantly, how do we know?
Vollers’ radical theory proposed that the Quran was originally composed in
the Hijazi common language (Volksprache)—a language he considered much
moreakintomodernArabicdialectsthantheliterarylanguage(Schriftsprache)
in which the Quran later came to be recited. He believed it was reworked
by Arab grammarians to adhere to the Classical standard of this literary lan-
guage, the ʕarabiyyah. He saw the literature on the Quranic reading traditions
(Qirāʔāt) and the variants described within them as providing essential traces
of the“original”language.FromthisheconcludedthattheQuranwasreworked
in later times by Arab grammarians, making massive changes to the linguistic
nature of the text, including pervasive changes to the consonantal skeleton of
the text. Especially the supposition of relatively late changes to the consonan-
tal skeleton by grammarians has become difficult to accept. It is now certain
that the standardization of the text well preceded the work of the Arab gram-
marians by over a century (Sinai 2014a; 2014b; van Putten 2019c).
But, while Vollers’ theory has several shortcomings that make it not quite
convincing today, the fundamental question as to what the language of the

chapter 1
Quran was, is still a valid one, and it has never adequately been answered.
Instead, a consensus developed although no evidence seems to have ever
been proffered for it. As Rabin (1955, 24) puts it: “Apparently independently,
H. Fleisch [(Fleisch 1947, 97–101)], R. Blachère [(Blachère 1947, 156–169)] and
C. Rabin [(C. Rabin 1955, 3–4)] arrived in the forties at the conclusion that
the language of the Koran, far from being pure Meccan either subsequently
revised (Vollers) or slightly adapted to the poetic idiom, was none other than
the poetic koinē.” But the seeds of this later consensus were already laid by
Friedrich Schwally in Geschichte des Korans part ii in 1919. I believe that this is
the first explicit endorsement of this view, and with that also one of the more
strongly argued iterations of the view. It is worth repeating the whole passage
here:
Generally, any tradition connecting the ʿUthmānic text in any way with
dialectal questions must be rejected, since the Koran is not written in
a local dialect at all but rather has a language identical to that of the
pre-Islamic poems. These, however, cannot possibly have been written in
dialectal form, as their authors belonged to quite different tribes, living so
far apart that the texts would have to show strong idiomatic differences.
Admittedly, when fixing a text in such a defective script as Arabic’s, where
vowels are generally not indicated and many consonants are expressed by
the same sign, some idiosyncrasies of the verbal presentation were sim-
ply not recognizable at all. Still, the lexical and grammatical agreement
is such that an actual uniform language must be assumed. After all, given
what we know about linguo-geographical conditions in other parts of the
world, it would be a total contradiction if such a drastic disappearance
of dialects were to have occurred in large areas of the Arabian Peninsula.
We are, thus, obliged to conclude that the ancient poems, as well as the
Koran, were composed in a generally intelligible standard language, the
difference of which from the local dialects of cultural centres like Mecca
and Medina was naturally less than from that in the more distant areas of
the Peninsula.
nöldeke et al. 2013, 260
I have my reservations about the confidence with which it is asserted that the
pre-Islamic poems represent a linguistic unity which skips both over the strong
classicizing force of the classical Arabic text tradition that without a doubt has
affected the language of poetry in many ways.1 I also believe we should raise

doubts about the true pan-Arabian provenance of the poetry. But this is not
our concern here. Rather, this book’s topic is to challenge the ease with which
the Quran is implicated into being part of this same intertribal pan-peninsular
literary language.
Despite the view certainly predating Rabin and his cohorts in the forties, it
certainly gained prominence from that point onwards. It is unfortunate that
Schwally’s passage is never cited, despite being a much clearer formulation
of the idea than any of the authors who Rabin cites to have formulated it. It
wassubsequentlywholeheartedlyaccepted,forexamplebyZwettler(1978,160)
who says: “most have come to agree that the ʿarabīya of the poets and the lan-
guage of the Qurʾān are essentially identical and that this poetic idiom was not
spoken by any group of Arabs as a vernacular tongue.” Versteegh (1984, 5) fol-
lows as well: “According to the accepted opinion the language of the poems […]
became the language of the Qurʾān as well.”
Despite the consensus that has developed on this topic, to my knowledge
nobody has actually attempted to demonstrate that these two languages are
“essentially identical.” Instead, this has simply been asserted. Any definition of
what the linguistic features of this supposed shared language are is something
the field has simply remained silent on. If there is any assertion about its lin-
guistic features at all, scholars have pointed to the Arab grammarians as having
codified or standardized it (e.g. Zwettler 1978, 101, 148).
I do not wish to get into the question here whether the language of poetry
and the Quran is just the ‘Old Arabic’ as it was spoken before Islam (e.g. Ver-
steegh 1984) or a specific oral-formulaic register (e.g. Zwettler 1978) and there-
fore it seems sensible to abstract away from the terms ‘Old Arabic’ or ‘poetic
Koiné’ and the many other terms that have been used by authors previously,
as sometimes the same term may have a different meaning to two different
authors. For example, to Rabin (1951, 3) ‘Classical Arabic’ is the language of pre-
Islamic poetry, while Fischer (2002, 1f.) would call that pre-classical. Hence, I
will define my own terms here.
First, I will use the term ʕarabiyyah to mean any form of Arabic that the
grammarians deem fit to describe (specifically the earliest grammarians such
as Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ, but later grammarians do not seem to deviate much
from them). Both Classical Arabic prose and the language attested in pre-
Islamic prose (but less so Quranic prose, as we will see in chapter 3) fall
coming) who presents compelling evidence that one can in fact find systematic phonolog-
ical differences between different poems, suggesting that the poetry—even after centuries of
classicization in their transmission—can still display significant linguistic diversity.

chapter 1
within the range of variation described by the grammarians. By Classical Ara-
bic, I refer to the subset of features of the ʕarabiyyah that eventually be-
come a strict normative standard, this is the form of Arabic that is described in
modern textbooks of Classical Arabic such asWright (1896) and Fischer (2002).
As we will see in chapter 2, this covers only a small subset of many factors of
phonological and morphological variation present in the ʕarabiyyah. I use the
term Quranic Arabic to refer to the register in which the Quran was initially
composed. I will argue that—contrary to the opinion of other authors—the
consonantal skeleton of the standard text is a fairly good guide to its linguistic
features.
Of course, viewing the language of the pre-Islamic poetry and Quranic Ara-
bic to be one and the same language is not a new view. The Classical Arabic
grammarians themselves do not make a systematic distinction between ‘Ara-
bic of Poetry’, ‘Arabic of Eloquent Arabs’ and ‘Arabic of the Quran’. All three
categories belong to the same eloquent language: the ʕarabiyyah. As with all
distinctions of language, such distinctions of course remain arbitrary. The dif-
ferences between Swedish and Norwegian are small enough that there is a high
degree of mutual intelligibility—yet for political reasons these languages are
considered separate. On the other hand, a Berber speaker from the Souss in
Morocco is unlikely to get very far conversing with a Libyan Berber from Zuara,
but for pan-Berberist ideological reasons might nevertheless insist that they
speak the same language.
As mentioned, while there is near-universal agreement on the idea that the
Quranic Arabic and the language of poetry is the same language, the ʕara-
biyyah, its features and supposed similarities are seldom defined. It is not of
much use for a linguist to argue what should or should not be considered the
“same language”. However, what a linguist can do is evaluate the linguistic fea-
tures of a distinct corpus. Studying the Quran, for example, we see that it has
a highly consistent use of only a subset of the linguistic features considered to
be ʕarabiyyah. As already noticed by the Arab grammarians, for example, the
Quran exclusively uses ḏālika, tilka and hunālika for the distal demonstratives,
and never uses ḏāka, tīka/ḏīka or hunāka. In this the Quran is clearly distinct
in its linguistic behaviour from Classical Arabic poetry, and Classical Arabic
prose of later times, which use these forms much more freely.While there is no
objective way to decide which and how many isoglosses one needs to declare
something as not being “essentially identical” to the language of poetry, observ-
ing such recurrent and systematic use of only a specific subset of the linguistic
variation is meaningful, and therefore important to distinguish, especially if it
would otherwise lead to the uncritical acceptance that two corpora—in the
case the Quran and pre-Islamic poetry—are essentially identical.

The fact that modern scholars did not sense the need to define this and
demonstrate the similarities seems to stem from the fact that they assume that
the language of the Quran is more or less identical to the textbook standard
of Classical Arabic which is a fairly uniform linguistic system which comes to
dominate later Classical literature. This, no doubt, is aided by the fact that the
Quranic reading tradition most widely adhered to today, the one of Ḥafṣʕan
ʕāṣim, has linguistic features that are very close (although by no means identi-
cal to) Classical Arabic. However, Ḥafṣ’s tradition is just one of the two trans-
missions of ʕāṣim, and besides him there are yet nine other canonical readings,
each with two canonical transmissions; these readings do not just differ in the
interpretation of the meaning of certain verses, but, in fact much more fre-
quently and for our purposes more importantly, differ significantly from one
another in phonetics, phonology and morphology.
Thus, we find that most modern authors assume that the ʕarabiyyah as
reflected in the Quran must have had the hamzah, despite the fact that the
grammarians describing the ʕarabiyyah clearly allowed for forms that had lost
this,withoutanynormativeexpressionof disapproval(seeSībawayhiii,541ff.).
For example, Hans Wehr in his review of Fück’s Arabiyya, commenting on why

ʕarabiyyah must have had the forms biʔr, muʔmin and nāʔim as in Classical
Arabic as it is taught today. Moreover, it is asserted that it was the target pro-

adhered to by Muslims all over Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia.3 If, as seems to
be implied here, the Quranic recitation of Warš is somehow less reflective of
the ʕarabiyyah than is the recitation of Ḥafṣ, this should certainly be explained,
and not be implicitly assumed.
An equally egregious example of the unintentional but nevertheless highly
problematic imposition of modern prescriptive norms of Classical Arabic unto
the Arabic of the Quran can be found in Zwettler’s (1978, 179, n. 70) discussion
of the pronunciation of nabīʔ for ‘prophet’: “the use of hamz in nabīy was a
peculiarlyḤijāzīpseudo-correctionandafeatureneitherof theʿarabiyyanorof
the other dialects.”4Where Zwettler’s certainty comes from that nabīʔ does not
belong to the ʕarabiyyah is unclear to me. Not only is the form nabīʔ recognized
in lexicographical works like Lisān al-ʕarab and by grammarians like Sībawayh
(iii, 547, 555)—never with the qualification that it is not ʕarabiyyah—it is once
again a reading that is broadly adhered to even today in Quranic recitation in
the tradition of Nāfiʕ.5 The only reason I can see why one would decide that
this is not the ʕarabiyyah is due to anachronistic imposition of a much later
Classical norm that in no way need be reflective of the ʕarabiyyah as it was con-
ceived of at the time of the prophet—even if we would accept that the Quran
was composed in that register, for which no compelling positive evidence has
been presented.
Nöldeke (1910) criticized Vollers (1906), not altogether fairly, for taking the
Gustav Flügel Quran as essentially the standard text, not recognizing the equal
validity of reading traditions not reflected in this text edition. This criticism
however should be seen as carrying a call to action: if the Quranic reading
traditions do not reflect the “true” Quranic Arabic, as opposed to the Arabic
of the Flügel Quran, what do the Quranic reading traditions represent, and
3 And he is not the only one of the canonical readers that would read these words thus. Like-
wise, ʔabū Ǧaʕfar and optionally ʔabū ʕamr recited like that. Also, nāʔimūna is read with the
loss of hamzah by the canonical reader Ḥamzah when he pauses on it (as he likely usually
would have, as both cases of it stand in verse final position, Q7:97; Q68:19).
4 One may also add that lā tanbir neither means—as Rabin, cited by Zwettler, translates—“do
not screech” nor as Zwettler suggests “do not raise your voice (i.e. with an expiratory stress).”
nabr is just an alternative, and seemingly more archaic term for hamz. See Xalīl b. ʔaḥmad
(Kitāb al-ʕayn s.v.) ربنwhere this meaning is given as its primary meaning (see also, Lane
2757a; Lisān 4323b). This obviously makes better sense in the context of a (no doubt falsi-
fied Hadith) where the prophet tells his follower off for saying yā-nabīʔa ḷḷāh ‘O prophe’ of
God!’, by answering lā tanbir bi-smī! ‘don’t apply the hamzah to my name!’
5 Moreover, whence the certainty comes that nabīʔ is the pseudo-correct form and nabiyy the
proper form is also unclear. As this word clearly comes from Hebrewנביאwhich, at least his-
torically contains ʔ (as evidenced by the final,)אit actually stands to reason that it should
have the hamzah in Classical Arabic (see §6.5.1.1 for further discussion).

which of these (if any) does represent the true language? It should be clear
from the previous paragraphs that many authors that have opined on the lan-
guage of the Quran—although occasionally paying lip service to the existence
of these readings—have essentially continued to operate on the same sim-
plifying assumption as Vollers, assuming that their print Quran is the stan-
dard text and an accurate reflection of Quranic Arabic, and that the other
19 canonical transmissions of the Quran are just inconvenient noise to be
ignored.
However, the Quranic reading traditions are not just differences on how to
read a certain word or syntagm; the many distinguishing factors between the
different reading traditions are in fact linguistic, marking both morphologi-
cal and phonological distinctions. ʔabū Ǧaʕfar, for example, regularly loses any
pre-consonantal hamzah (e.g. rās ‘head’); al-Kisāʔī has a fourth phonemic long
vowel (hadē ‘he lead’ but daʕā ‘he cried out’) and Ibn Kaṯīr consistently uses
long plural pronouns such as ʔantumū ‘you (pl.)’, ʕalayhimū ‘upon them’. When
scholarshipreachedtheconsensusthatthelanguageof theQuranisessentially
the same as that of the poetry, this should not have been uncritically accepted.
One should ask which of these 20 canonical transmissions, if any, is the true
language of the Quran. And why should that one be preferred over the other as
being representative of the ʕarabiyyah? Just because the transmission of Ḥafṣ
strikes the modern scholar as most familiar, as it stands closest to the strict
classical standard that emerges centuries later—the standard to which also the
language of poetry gets mercilessly reshaped (C. Rabin 1955, 21)—it cannot be
the reason why we close the book on the investigation into what the language
of the Quran is.
As should be clear from the discussion above, despite there now being well
over a century of scholarship discussing the language of the Quran in rela-
tion to the language of the pre-Islamic period and the language of poetry, the
Quran has never been allowed to tell its own linguistic history. Instead, its lin-
guistic history has been co-opted by those telling the linguistic history of the
poetry with the automatic assumption that the Quran is part of this same his-
tory as well.This is an oversimplification and indefensible from the perspective
of historical linguistics. The Quran is a long text with ample linguistic infor-
mation, not only in its reading traditions, but also in the very structure of the
text itself. Scholars have gone to great lengths to disqualify the value of the
Quranic orthography to inform us about its language. However, avenues that
examine how one can prove that the orthography is meaningful, or indeed
rightfully dismissed, have rarely been explored. The orthography of the Quran
isquitedistinct fromthelaterClassicalArabicorthography,andlikewisediffers
significantly from Arabic orthography that we find in pre-Islamic epigraphy;

this should give us pause: why is this text so different, and why was it so impor-
tant to preserve?
Moreover, the Quran follows rhyming patterns throughout almost the entire
text;onlyatinyfractionof theversesdoesnotrhymewiththerest.Rhymedtext
is an invaluable part of the toolkit of any philologist aiming to reconstruct the
language of a certain period, as it helps to break through the otherwise difficult
to disentangle question of what parts of an orthography are simply historical
spelling and which parts reflect phonetic realty. Vollers (1906, 55ff.) saw the
value of Quranic rhyme as a source of linguistic information, but this valuable
linguistic resource has been almost completely ignored since then.6
1.2
The Uthmanic Text Type and the Quranic Consonantal Text
One of the reasons why the Quran may not have been afforded the ability to
tell its own linguistic history originates from a certain amount of skepticism
that the text and its orthography, as we have it today, can be confidently pro-
jected back to the very period in which the text was composed. Criticism of
the transmission history of any tradition of text is a staple of Islamic studies,
and certainly in the seventies severe doubts were raised that the Quranic text
truly stems from the time that the tradition tells us it comes from.7 However,
times have changed and important advancements have been made especially
when it comes to the textual history of the Quran. Early Quranic manuscripts
have in recent years become easily accessible as more and more are massively
digitized and editions are published. Where previously it may not have been
as clear how ancient and well-preserved the Quranic text truly is, and thus
what to make exactly of its orthographic idiosyncrasies, it is now clear that the
text is considerably ancient. By examining the specific orthographic idiosyn-
crasies of the Quranic text across a variety of early Quranic manuscripts, Van
Putten (2019c) has shown that all early manuscripts come from a single writ-
ten archetype whose orthographic specificities have been judiciously copied
6 Notable exceptions being Nöldeke et al. (2013, 415) and Rabin (1951, 115f., §bb) who both
realized that Quranic rhyme clearly distinguishes ā (written with ʔalif ) and ē (written with
yāʔ) where Classical Arabic pronounces them both as ā. But strangely, this view was never
picked up and widely accepted. Diem (1979) even goes so far as to explicitly deny that the
two spellings of the Classical Arabic ʔalif maqṣūrah reflect any pronunciation difference at
all—not addressing the evidence from the rhyme to the contrary. See Van Putten (2017a) for
a defense of a phonemic distinction of ē and ā in Quranic Arabic.

over the centuries. All early manuscripts known so far descend from a single
text type referred to as the Uthmanic Text Type (ut),8 which may plausibly be
connectedwiththestandardizationeffortattributedtothethirdcaliphʕuṯmān
b. ʕaffān (reign 23–35ah/644–656ce). While the manuscript evidence cannot
preclude with absolute certainty an earlier redaction, a time much later than
his reign is now a virtual impossibility. We have large portions of the Quran
complete in first century manuscripts that all belong to the ut, with carbon
dating early enough that much later dating is rather unlikely. In other words,
we have evidence and a clear view of the Quranic text in all its linguistic details
asit waswrittendownmeredecadesafterthedeathof theprophet.Thisshould
afford it the central and essential role as a primary source for the language of
the Quran that it is.
The ut is highly uniform, but there are about 40 variants in the consonantal
skeleton of the text in which the original different regional codices differ from
one another. These regional variants can be attributed to four regions: Syria,
Kufa, Basra and Medina, and these regional variants form a stemma that goes
back to a single archetype (Sidky 2021; Dutton 2001; 2004; Cook 2004). These
four regional types must be archetypal to the four regions and must be part of
the initial distribution of the ut.
A central pillar of the current work is the incorporation of linguistic infor-
mation of the ut. Whereas the consonantal skeleton of, e.g. the Hebrew bible
has long been viewed as an important source of linguistic information of Bib-
lical Hebrew (e.g. Kahle 1947, 95–102; Tov 1992, 47–49; Khan 2013, 13–30 and of
course the rich Ktiv/Qere tradition within the Masoretic tradition itself), the
sameattentionhasnotbeenaccordedtotheQuranicConsonantalText(qct).
As there is no critical edition of the ut, my transcriptions of the qct will be
based to a large extent on the standard text, as we find these in print Qurans
today which ultimately descend from the 1924CairoEdition(ce). Unlike some

mented the orthography and spelling variants of the ut, the qct of the ce can
be thought of in some ways as the result of medieval text criticism, although
lacking the diligent critical apparatus that one might wish to have. Despite the
impressive conservatism of the ce, the text is not always an accurate reflection
of what we typically find in early manuscripts.This is especially the case for the
use of ʔalif, which is used to write the ā significantly more often in the ce than
is typical for early manuscripts. But there are also several other orthographic
practices innovative in the ce compared to early manuscripts. For example, in
early manuscripts the nominative pronoun ḏū is consistently spelled, وذwhile
in early manuscripts it is consistently followed by an ʔalif,ذوا
.Whenever rele-
vant, I will change the text to better fit what early manuscripts reflect and I will
reference the relevant data for such a reconstruction, often discussed in detail
in Appendix B.
In my transcriptions of the qct, I will use the consonantal dotting, even
though those were used quite sparingly in early Quranic manuscripts. In fact,
it is often suggested that the original redaction of ʕuṯmān’s standard text had
been completely without consonantal dotting, and was just a bare consonan-
tal skeleton known as the rasm. Bursi (2018) has recently pointed out that there
is rather little evidence for such a view. The very earliest manuscripts that we
have all contain some amount of dotting—although indeed used sparingly.9
Moreover, he demonstrates that the sparse dotting in early Hijazi manuscripts
clearly show similar patterns to the dotting used in the early documentary
papyri.
The reason why I provide full dotting for the qct, first and foremost is
because it greatly aids the readability of the text. But I also believe it is justi-
fied to assume that we can know the correct dotting for the consonants for two
reasons. First of all, whenever dots do appear in the early manuscripts, they
overwhelmingly agree with what we find in the ce and in other manuscripts
that have dots. This gives us confidence that for the majority of the text, there
was a pretty clear idea what the dotting of the consonant was supposed to be,
even when early manuscripts were often incomplete in marking it. The second
reason is based on the evidence from the reading traditions. Sidky (forthcom-
ing) shows that the canonical reading traditions of the Quran only disagree
with each other 284 times on consonantal dotting. This may seem like a large
number, but considering the thousands of times that the readers could have
9 In fact, it is rather the later Kufic manuscripts that lose (almost) all dots. One wonders if the
traditional view that the ut had a bare undotted rasm stems from the examination of the
somewhat later Kufic manuscripts, rather than the truly oldest Hijazi manuscripts with sig-
nificantly more dotting.

plausibly disagreed on the dotting but do not do so, the number is actually
strikingly low. This suggests that there indeed was an early consensus on what
the consonants of the qct were, even when the text may frequently have been
writtenambiguously.Thisconsensusshouldnotbeoverstatedeither,of course.
Much of the dotting may be filled in by common sense, rather than a shared
memory. In most contexts, there simply is no other plausible reading of the
sequenceكلدthan, كلذthatisḏālika.Thecombinationof self-evidentreadings
and consensus on the non-self-evident parts provide a strong basis to tran-
scribe the qct with these dots.
In my representation of the qct, I do not distinguish between ʔalif maq-
ṣūrah bi-ṣūrat al-yāʔ (e.g.‘ ىنبhe built’) and yāʔ (e.g.‘ ىنبsons of (gen./acc.)’), as
these are not distinct graphemes in early Quranic manuscripts.10 In non-final
position, both are written with a dotted denticle (e.g.هديه
‘he led them’,يهديه
‘he
leads them’).
The hamzah is never written in early Quranic manuscripts as it lacks any
means to express it.11 If the seat of the hamzah is yāʔ, it will simply be repre-
sented as any other yāʔ as we find in the ce, e.g.الذيب
‘the wolf’ and will not be
displayed as a dotless yāʔ (الذىب
.)12
The tāʔ marbūṭah is never distinguished from the hāʔ, as this graphemic dis-
tinction does not exist in early Quranic manuscripts, e.g.نعمه الله
‘the grace of
God’.13 The earliest muṣḥaf that I am aware of that uses the two dots on top
10
Nor are they distinct graphemes, even in much later manuscripts, Quranic or otherwise.
11
We can hardly agree with Zwettler (1978, 179, n. 70) that the hamzah is most likely the
oldest of the diacritical signs used in the Quranic Arabic manuscripts (citing, but misun-
derstanding Abbott 1939, 39f.). To the contrary, the hamzah sign does not get expressed
with a designated sign in Quranic manuscripts for the first centuries of Islam, even when
vowel signs are invented, the hamzah is simply expressed with vowel signs which do dou-
ble duty as markers of the hamzah, but in that context are not always unambiguous in
whether they denoted hamzah or just vowels. Even while at some point Kufic manuscripts
start using separate colours for the hamzah in the third Islamic century, contemporane-
ous with this practice there are still many manuscripts that do not distinguish them. The
modern hamzah sign constitutes the latest layer of Arabic diacritics (Revell 1975, 180).
12
The requirement of a dotless yāʔ for the seat of the hamzah is a result of typographic
constraints, and not a practice that was commonplace in medieval manuscripts. Lack of
awareness of Classical Arabic manuscript culture has occasionally led to rather bizarre
statements, such as Hopkins (1984, §20a) affirming thatبيس الراى
“what a bad opinion!”
must lack a hamzah because it is written with a dotted yāʔ. It is not difficult to find words
written with a dotted yāʔ where the word carries a hamzah in a context where it is explicit
that the word is to be read with a hamzah.
13
As Revell (1975, 180) points out, the dotting of the tāʔ marbūṭah constitutes the latest layer
of Arabic diacritics, one that was only rarely introduced in Kufic manuscripts. See also
Moritz ei1, “Arabic Writing”.

chapter 1
of tāʔ marbūṭah is the Ibn al-Bawwāb Quran from 391ah/1000ce, the earliest
dated Nasx Quran written centuries after the ancient Hijazi and Kufic Qurans
that we are concerned with.
Whenever there is disagreement between reading traditions on how a cer-
tain consonantal skeleton is to be read, the disputed consonant will be left
undotted, for exampleفتٮٮٮوا
(Q4:94) which is variously read fa-tabayyanū
(فتبينوا
)or fa-taṯabbatū (فتثبتوا
.)
Finally, while in terms of the spelling of the ʔalif for ā, I will usually fol-
low the ce, with the important note that the ce frequently spells words plene
where manuscripts usually write it defectively, when it is relevant to the dis-
cussion, I will write the word defectively if it is consistently done so in early
manuscripts, or I will use a dagger ʔalif to indicate that it is sometimes writ-
ten with and sometimes without this ʔalif. Note here that it means that the
dagger ʔalif has an explicitly different function in my transcription of the qct
compared to how it is used in the Quran today. It does not just note that an ā
is written defectively, but that the ʔalif, which may be of any function, is not
always written in the manuscript. An example might beشٰىto denote that šayʔ
is variously writtenشاىorشىin the location of the text under discussion in
early manuscripts.
1.3
Overview
As it stands now, the Quran has never been allowed to tell its own story as to
what its language is; instead, rather convoluted arguments have been devel-
oped as to why we cannot and should not use the Quranic orthography as a
source of information for its language, all the while (implicitly) assuming that
the modern standard Cairo Edition is an accurate reflection of the language of
the Quran. But just as we cannot take for granted that the Quran does display
the language as it was composed, we cannot take for granted that the Quran
does not display the language as spoken. We certainly cannot assume that the
language of the Quran must have been linguistically identical to the Classical
Arabic or to the ʕarabiyyah.The current work aims to close this major lacuna in
our understanding of the history of the Arabic language. I believe there are four
topics that need to be addressed before we can work towards a final conclusion
about the language of the Quran.
In Chapter 2, I will explore what the ʕarabiyyah is according to those that
are said to have standardized it—the Arab grammarians. The ʕarabiyyah is
all too often equated to Classical Arabic, the fairly uniform standard language
described in textbooks and which forms the basis for Modern Standard Ara-

bic. But the early Arab grammarians allow for much more linguistic varia-
tion, clearly allowing and even endorsing forms that would not be considered
acceptable in Classical Arabic. However, in order to understand the linguistic
environment from which the Quran emerged, we must of course be informed
bytheseearliersourcesratherthananachronisticallyprojectthetextbookstan-
dard onto this period and expect the Quran to conform to that.
With a clearer picture of the linguistic variation that was accepted in the
ʕarabiyyah according to the early grammarians, it will be possible to exam-
ine the Quranic reading traditions in Chapter 3. As has been mentioned, the
Quran today is accepted to be recited in ten different reading traditions, of
which several still enjoy broad popularity. It will be shown that much of the
linguistic variation described by the Arab grammarians is in fact employed
in these reading traditions. Showing that the great amount of linguistic vari-
ation the grammarians describe are not just odd deviations from an implicit
accepted standard language close or identical to Classical Arabic, but that
this variation was inherently part of the ʕarabiyyah and employed as such.
Moreover, the chapter will show that the linguistic variation in the reading
traditions cannot be understood as dialects of Arabic. They all have clear
artificial linguistic elements which must be understood as conscious deci-
sions to change the language as part of an artificial performance register.
However, due to the vastly different approaches found in each of these read-
ings, it will be shown that it is difficult to decide what the true language
of the Quran is, as the reading traditions provide twenty mutually exclusive
answers.
As the reading traditions seem unable to give a unified answer as to what
the language of the Quran is, in Chapters 4 and 5 I shift focus to the language
of the qct. While some authors have admitted the possibility that the Quran
in its original composition may have had some accommodation to a local pro-
nunciation, again and again it is affirmed that grammatically it is essentially
the same language as the poetic koiné. Chapter 4 puts this claim to the test
by comparing the isoglosses of the different Arabic dialects collected by the
Arab grammarians and comparing them against the linguistic data that can be
gleaned from the qct. Chapter 5 subsequently examines the phonological fea-
tures of Quranic Arabic. While in Chapter 3 it is shown that when doing this
with the reading tradition no clear pattern appears at all, all readings haphaz-
ardly mix and match features from different dialects, when looking at the qct
a strikingly uniform picture emerges. In its morphological and phonetic fea-
tures, the language of the qct is clearly Hijazi Arabic. Occasionally this can
be corroborated by pre-Islamic Arabic epigraphic evidence as well. This clear
picture that emerges cannot be coincidence, and therefore we must conclude

chapter 1
that the qct is an accurate reflection of the language of the Quran, and that
this language is indeed the Hijazi dialect.
Finally, Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 return to the reading traditions. In previ-
ous articles I have shown that Quranic Arabic contained a number of features
quite distinct from its later reading traditions. Most notable here is the fact
that Quranic Arabic seems to have almost completely lacked the hamzah and
had lost final short vowels and tanwīn. A major source of skepticism of ear-
lier scholars was that, had the language of the Quran been so different from
its reading traditions, one would expect to see traces of this in the tradition
and moreover one would expect to see pseudo-correct forms. Chapter 6 dives
deepintotheclassicizationof thehamzah,uncoveringavarietyof unetymolog-
ical hamzahs appearing in the reading traditions as well as many places where
a word should have logically had a hamzah but inexplicably lacks it. Chapter
7 will focus on the many uncertainties and disagreements among the readers
on the case inflection—sometimes uncovering words that unexpectedly lack
case inflection completely. Moreover, these chapters focus on early reports of
the readers, and discussions that followed on some of the controversial read-
ings. These show that at least for some of the readers, for whom we have early
reports, it is clear that their choices were not a matter of accurate transmission
of howreadersbelievedtheprophetwouldhavesaidit,butratheritwasaratio-
nal endeavour that required advanced grammatical knowledge. It was the duty
of the Quranic reader to rationalize and choose which words should receive
which case vowel or hamzah and why. This clearly rationalising approach of
the readers can be uncovered from the tradition.

Introduction
In the Western scholarly tradition, it has become customary to consider the
language of the Quran to be identical with the language of poetry and the one
that established the standard of Classical Arabic, e.g.
The Qurʾānic language, though virtually identical with the language of
pre-Islamic poetry, has a typically religious flavour, manifesting itself in
the peculiarities of style and language that must have been absent in
other registers.

thackston 1994, xii
Apparently independently, H. Fleisch, R. Blachère and C. Rabin arrived
in the forties at the conclusion that the language of the Koran, far from
being pure Meccan either subsequently revised … or slightly adapted to
the poetic idiom, was none other than the poetic koinē.
c. rabin 1955, 24
“At this stage … it seems safe to say that the Qurʾān was revealed and first
uttered in a linguistic form that was, if not identical with the language
of poetry, close enough to it to be distinguished rather sharply from the
spoken dialects …

underdefined what the linguistic features of this language are and how we can
see what “Classical Arabic” means in these contexts. Even less defined is any
concrete evidence that the language of the Quran and poetry are virtually iden-
tical despite a near ubiquitous consensus on this point.
Classical Arabic is generally defined by its corpus, rather than through a
linguistic definition. The most explicit definition of this corpus that consti-
tutes a single standard form of Classical Arabic was probably formulated by
Rabin (1955) “the beginnings of Classical Arabic”, who defines Classical Ara-
bic by its traditional corpus, which to him consists of four sources: 1. pre-
Islamic and early Islamic poetry, 2. The Quran, 3. The Hadiths and 4. The first
century papyri and letters handed down in history works. All but the last of
these sources are still considered today to be part of the corpus of the ʕara-
biyyah. This is closely in line with what the Arab grammarians themselves felt
was material necessary to comment upon for the ʕarabiyyah. If we look at
what the Arab grammarians, and specifically Sībawayh, the earliest of these
whose work we have in writing, consider to be part of the corpus worth com-
menting upon, we find that they agree to a large extent with the definition
of Rabin: Poetry, the Quran and Hadiths play a central role in the linguistic
evidence proffered by the grammarians, albeit often to highlight unusual prac-
tices.
However, we will argue in this chapter that Classical Arabic is not obviously
identical to the “poetic koiné”, nor the basis for all descriptions of the language.
Instead, it is rather the outcome of a long negotiation of what “proper Arabic”
actuallyis.Theearlygrammariansonlymarkthestartof thisnegotiation,andit
takescenturiesforanyclearlinguisticstandardtodevelop.Whilemanyauthors
consider Sībawayh the first person to codify and standardize Classical Arabic,
he does nothing of the sort.
Central in Sībawayh’s work, but also what later grammarians focus on, is
what “they” say. This elusive “they” is understood, for example by Carter (2004,
39), to refer to the natural speech of the Bedouin, but this inference does not
seem to be based on the actual statements of Sībawayh himself. AsWebb (2017,
302ff.) has shown, whenever Sībawayh explicitly assigns a name to the lan-
guage of “them”, it is generally the “speech of the Arabs” (kalām al-ʕarab) that
gets mentioned while “bedouin” (ʔaʕrāb) are only rarely—and, in such cases
oftennegatively—mentioned.Othercontemporarygrammarianslikeal-Farrāʔ
(d. 209/824) are much more liberal in assigning tribal association with certain
linguistic features found in the ʕarabiyyah, but there too, little indication is
given that it is specifically the Arabic of the Bedouins that plays a central role.
Rather, the main source of the proper use of the ʕarabiyyah is by definition a

prescriptive one; it is the Arabic of “those whose Arabic can be relied upon”
(man yūṯaqu bi-ʕarabiyyati-hī) (Carter 2004, 41).
The modern orientalist tradition has mostly been satisfied in following this
prescriptive definition of the ʕarabiyyah, but follow this up with an (usually
implicit) assumption that what the Arab grammarians considered the ʕara-
biyyah is more-or-less identical to what modern textbooks such as Wright and
Fischer call Classical Arabic. The Classical Arabic as we find it in our textbooks
is a fairly homogeneous linguistic unit, with little to no morphological, pho-
netic or syntactic variation. This, however, is not at all what we find in the
earliest descriptions of the ʕarabiyyah, which are absolutely bristling with lin-
guistic variation. Subsequently the identification of the ʕarabiyyah as Classical
Arabicwithstrictnormsandlittlevariationallexemplifiedbythedisparatecor-
pora such as the speech of “them”, the language of poetry, Quran, and hadiths
are all lumped together with assumed linguistic homogeneity without actually
demonstrating it.
The assumed linguistic unity of these disparate corpora has frequently led
to the imposition of facts of morphology and phonology that cannot self-
evidentlybededucedfromthecorporatheydiscuss.Forexample,ondiscussing
the development of a standard orthography of “Classical Arabic”, Versteegh
(2014, 64) says “in the Ḥijāz the hamzah was probably absent, but in the variety
of the language in which the Qurʾān was revealed and the pre-Islamic poems
were composed, the hamzah was pronounced”.1 While one can indeed make a
case for (at least part of) the poetic corpus to have had a hamzah, purely on its
necessity in the poetic meter, the assumption that this comes part and parcel
with the language of the Quran as well, is not demonstrated, nor in fact par-
ticularly obvious. Sībawayh, for example, reports in detail on the possibility of
dropping the hamzah. This is not presented as a non-standard usage, but sim-
ply one of the options of Arabic, besides full pronunciation (see Sībawayh, iii,
541–556). Considering that Quranic orthography indeed has no way to express
the hamzah, and our earliest manuscripts make no use of orthographic means
to represent it at all, how can we be so sure it was there? Even if we accept that
the Quran was composed in the ʕarabiyyah, if the ʕarabiyyah is the language
described and standardized by the grammarians it is still completely possible
that the composition was entirely without hamzah. As we will see, especially
in chapter 3, many of the canonical readings today still lack hamzah in many
places where the later Classical Arabic would have it.
1 For other quotes of scholars assuming that hamzah must have been the norm in the ʕara-
biyyah see also the previous chapter.

chapter 2
These examples are not just isolated cases, as we will see in this chapter
where we will explore the descriptions of the early Arabic grammarians, they
allowed for much more variation than the strict norms of Classical Arabic, and
no homogeneousstandard can be recovered fromthese works.When one looks
closer, we find that the traditional corpora of the ʕarabiyyah are noticeably dif-
ferent from one-another, and even within these individual corpora there is sig-
nificant diversity. Just because they all fall under the aegis of the ʕarabiyyah—
that is the forms of Arabic the Arab grammarians felt the need to comment
upon—does not meanthey shownosystematicandcategoricaldistinctgroups
from a linguistic perspective.
With recent advances in the study of pre-Islamic and early Islamic Arabic
it has now become clear that the Arabic the grammarians saw fit to com-
ment upon is a highly selective subset of forms of Arabic that were around.
Exclusively taking that which the grammarians saw fit to comment upon as
“Arabic”, ignores a vast amount of linguistic variation that existed in the Pre-
Islamic and early Islamic period. As Al-Jallad (2015; 2017a; 2018a) has shown,
many other varieties, which are on linguistic grounds evidently Arabic, fall
completely outside of the purview of the Arab grammarians. Already in the
Pre-Islamic period we find varieties of Arabic that lack the full system of case
vowels and nunation, and there is no doubt that such varieties existed in the
times the early grammarians were active. Yet, these go completely unmen-
tioned.
Because of this, we now have good reason to doubt the idea that all of Arabic
formed a single homogeneous linguistic unit. Moreover, the ambiguities inher-
ent to the Arabic script give a false sense of homogeneity in the “Classical cor-
pora”. Little to no skepticism is applied to the vocalizations and interpretations
of the originally defective writing of Arabic, even though such disambiguation
only appears centuries after the times that these corpora were composed. This
is rather surprising as, for example, Rabin (1955, 21) seemed to be well aware
of the fact that there was a strong classicizing trend towards even the poetic
corpus, which, due to its strict meter, is probably somewhat less susceptible to
later classicization than, say, the hadiths or the Quran.
Just because the Arab grammarians considered all of the sources mentioned
before to be one and the same ʕarabiyyah does not mean that they do not
show categorical difference from a modern linguistic perspective. The linguis-
tic unity sought by the grammarians should probably be seen more as a soci-
olinguisticconstructthanaclaimof similarityonapurely(historical)linguistic
grounds. The language, no matter what the corpus, needs to be studied inde-
pendently, and its linguistic features need to be mapped out. Only when it can
be shown that the differences in phonology and morphology can be attributed

purely to stylistic differences, does it seem warranted to call these languages
“essentially the same language”.
As the Quran was evidently one of the most important works of Arabic liter-
ature, grammarians have always felt the need to comment on the language of
the Quran and its reading traditions.The Quran, and to some extent its reading
traditions,thereforenaturallyfeedintothedefinitionof ClassicalArabic—that
whichthegrammariansfelttheneedtocommentupon—butthisdoesnotnec-
essarily prove that the language of the Quran and the language of the poetry
are identical; it only means that the grammarians discussed both within the
same grammatical endeavour. Of course, despite possible differences, clearly
the linguistic variation was not so large that describing them together was alto-
gether futile, but considering their scope and considerable tolerance towards
linguisticvariation,itseemsverypossiblethatthereareappreciabledifferences
present that set these corpora apart.
2.2
The Linguistic Variation in the ʕarabiyyah
In the previous section, I argued that the ʕarabiyyah (as well as Classical Ara-
bic) is an ill-defined term from a linguistic perspective. It is a language that
comes from different sources, all treated by the grammarians as belonging to
one single corpus of language. Modern scholars have often accepted the iden-
tity of these sources as being all from a single language either called Classical
Arabic or “the poetic koiné” which I will call here simply the ʕarabiyyah (reserv-
ing Classical Arabic for the strict standard that emerged later).
This is problematic on a linguistic level. We do not want to take for granted
that these languages are identical, we want to be able to test this hypothesis.
It is not a given that any two poems are linguistically homogeneous, nor is it
clear that the language of any two hadiths is exactly the same. Far from pre-
senting a clear homogeneous linguistic unit, the Arab grammarians record a
vast amount of linguistic variation within their grammars. A large amount of
this morphological and phonological variation described by the grammarians
falls completely outside of the standard Classical Arabic as it is described, for
example, by Thackston (1994), Fischer (2002) or Wright (1896).
Many authors, implicitly or explicitly, assume that the Classical Arabic is
in fact what the Arab grammarians describe, with some dialectal forms being
described parenthetically on the side. For example Classical Arabic seems to
be what Rabin has in mind when he speaks of “Literary Arabic”, which he con-
siders the “the standardized form [of Classical Arabic], which was used as the
internationallanguageintheAbbasidempire”(C.Rabin1955,3).Evenacursory

chapter 2
lookatearlyAbbasidlinguistictreatiessuchasSībawayh’sal-Kitāboral-Farrāʔ’s
Luġāt al-Qurʔān reveals a vast number of linguistic variants, options and pos-
sibilities which are often mutually exclusive. These do not in any way give the
impression that there is a single literary standard.They certainly do not suggest
that what eventually becomes Classical Arabic is the default and standard form
of the language at this time.
The following section will discuss a variety of cases where the grammarians
describe morphological or phonological variation that goes beyond the norms
of Classical Arabic. Here we will see that, while occasionally some degree of
ranking of forms is given, the preferred form is not always what has become the
textbook norm, and very often no explicit judgement is given of which form is
better.
I will primarily draw on the two earliest grammatical works on the Arabic
language available to us, those of Sībawayh (d. 180/796) and al-Farrāʔ (d. 209/
824). While Sībawayh often describes an astounding amount of morpholog-
ical and phonological variation, he is less judicious about explicitly assign-
ing it to certain dialects of Arabic. In his Luġāt al-Qurʔān, al-Farrāʔ is much
more cursory in his descriptions, but gives more detailed information as to
how certain variation is considered to map onto the different dialects. Occa-
sionally we find that these two early grammarians disagree, which in itself
is already interesting: two Arab grammarians sometimes describe linguistic
facts that are mutually exclusive, and unresolvable. While such occurrences
are rare, we will encounter one such disagreement in the discussion of ʔimālah
(see §2.2.2.2). In such cases I will also draw on some later grammatical works
such as al-Mubarrad (d. 285/898) and al-ʔaxfaš (d. 215/830), to give a sense of
where the consensus may have developed after the disagreement in this early
period.
2.2.1
The Third Person Pronominal Suffixes
Sībawayh devotes two subsequent chapters to the morphological allomorphy
that is found in the masculine singular and plural pronominal suffixes. He first
devotes a chapter to the length of the final syllable of the pronominal suffixes
-hu and -hum (and -kum, -tum, ʔantum) (Sībawayh, iv, 189) and then on the
vowel harmony that occurs in these two suffixes (Sībawayh, iv, 195).
According to Sībawayh, the pronominal suffix -hu/i is short when it follows
a long vowel (ā, ī, ū) or a diphthong (ay, aw). In all other cases the vowel, in
principle, is long. Hence, after any short vowel (a, i, u) or consonant the suf-
fix is long -hū/ī. This is an interesting deviation from Classical Arabic as it is
presented, for example in Fischer (2002, §268.3), who holds that after closed
syllables the suffix should be short, i.e. min-hu whereas Sībawayh argues for

min-hū. He says that only “some Arabs” would use the form min-hu, but to him
the full pronunciation is better (al-ʔitmāmu ʔaǧwad). In other words, what is
nowthenormativeforminClassicalArabic,seemstohaveonlybeenaminority
form in Sībawayh’s view, and moreover a form he explicitly values lower than
the other form he describes.
Interesting to our discussion here is that after the discussion of the short-
ened and lengthened forms, Sībawayh tells us that the Quranic quotes wa-
nazzalnā-hu tanzīlan (Q17:106), ʔin taḥmil ʕalay-hi yalhaṯ(Q7:176), wa-šaraw-
hu bi-ṯamanin baxsin (Q12:20) and xuḏū-hufa-ġullū-hu (Q69:30) are the “better
of thetworeadings”.Hedoesnotelaborateonwhattheotherreadingwouldbe,
but as all of these forms have -hu preceded by long vowels and diphthongs, it is
obvious that the lengthening of the pronoun is meant in this context (-hū, -hī).
This is the reading of Ibn Kaṯīr, the Meccan reader of the canonical seven (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §1212). While Sībawayh values these lengthened forms less than the
shortened ones, he explicitly tells us that the lengthening is Arabic (al-ʔitmāmu
ʕarabiyy). Being ‘less good’ or ‘less common’, therefore, does not disqualify a
form from being ʕarabiyy.
While al-Farrāʔ does not discuss the length of the pronoun -hu/ū after a
consonant in Luġāt al-Qurʔān, he does address this in his Maʕānī al-Qurʔān
(i, 224f.), where he says that “they” pronounce such forms with short vow-
els, giving daʕ-hu yaḏhabu, min-hu, ʕan-hu as examples, and announces that
“they” hardly ever say [wa-lā yakādūna yaqūlūna] min-hū, ʕan-hū. Al-Farrāʔ
here therefore has the opposite opinion of Sībawayh.
Al-ʔaxfaš (Maʕānī, 27), direct student of Sībawayh, follows his teacher in
preferring min-hū while expressing a much more normatively negative opin-
ion of min-hu saying it is not good in Arabic [wa-hāḏā laysa bi-ǧayyidin fī l-
ʕarabiyyah].Whereasal-Mubarrad(al-muqtaḍab,i,401)explicitlyendorsesthe
short form min-hu. It therefore does not seem that the competing opinions on
what was the proper way of treating such cases was resolved in the generations
after Sībawayh.
Sībawayh informs us that speakers have a choice for the plural pronoun -
hum/-him, they can either choose to keep it short, or use lengthened forms
-humū and the harmonized variant -himī pronoun. This lengthening also
involves other masculine plural pronominal elements such as ʔantumū, -tumū,
-kumū and the independent pronoun humū. Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 33) agrees with
the optionality of this feature, saying, “the Arabs are united in [both options:]
not placing a vowel after the m, or placing an u after it. In their speech it is:
minhum or minhumū; ʕalaykum or ʕalaykumū; kuntum or kuntumū. We do not
know it as being exclusive to anyone (to have) one of the two linguistic prac-
tices (luġatayn). All of them say it in both articulations (al-qawlayn).”

chapter 2
As for the harmonized form, Sībawayh tells us that ‘some of them’ use -himū
insteadof -himī.Hereonceagain,wefindaconflictwithClassicalArabic;While
Fischer (2002, §268.4) informs us that lengthened forms like -humū and -himū,
areusedinpoetry,hemakesnomentionof theexistenceof apronominal-himī,
and this form seems to have largely fallen out of use in normative Classical Ara-
bic, except when end rhyme in poetry requires it. Moreover, note that the forms
presented by Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ in no way seem to imply that they are to
be used in poetry only, or even primarily. This is different, for example with the
shortened pronominal suffix -hu/-hi after short vowels, which Sībawayh explic-
itly only allows as a poetic license.
In the second of the two chapters Sībawayh addresses the vowel harmony,
which shows that the allomorphs -hī, -hi, -him and -himī (and -himū) are trig-
gered by a preceding i or y. While the vowel harmony is the general form that
Sībawayh presents first, he also informs the reader that the people of the Hijaz
say: bi-hū [] وهبand laday-hū [وهيدل
,]ʕalay-humū [ومهيلع
]and bi-humū [بهمو
,]
showing that the people of the Hijaz both lacked vocalic length disharmony
and vowel harmony. He adds that the Hijazis recite the Quran fa-xasafnā bi-
hū wa-bi-dāri-hū l-ʔarḍa (Q28:81), a form that today is uncanonical. There is
no obvious expression of derision for these non-harmonizing forms. Al-Farrāʔ
(Luġāt, 10–11) likewise attributes the lack of vowel harmony to the Qurayš, the
people of the Hijaz in general, and the eloquent people from Yemen, whereas
the presence of vowel harmony is attributed to the ʔasad and Qays and Tamīm.
He adds that Kinānah and Saʕd b. Bakr normally apply vowel harmony to
the plural pronoun, but before a two consonant cluster this vowel harmony is
removed (e.g. ʕalayhumu l-qawla), explicitly mentioning that this is the prac-
tice al-Kisāʔī adopts and that it is the most eloquent of linguistic practices.The
formsal-FarrāʔcitesfortheHijazdonothavethefinallongvowelsontheplural
pronoun forms as Sībawayh mentions, which should probably be understood
to mean that at least according to al-Farrāʔ the long forms of the plural pro-
nouns are optional also in Hijazi Arabic, something in line with the optionality
of length as a general feature.
We should take the lack of derision as a serious indication that the Hijazi
norm is simply considered acceptable.This is clear from the fact that Sībawayh
does not avoid derision elsewhere when it comes to pronominal harmony. He
considers the min-him used by the eastern tribe of Rabīʕah to be a vile linguis-
tic practice [luġah radīʔah] and the ʔaḥlāmi-kim and bi-kim used by one of the
branches of Rabīʕah, Bakr b. Wāʔil, to be extremely vile [radīʔ ǧiddan]. Clearly
the Hijazi forms fell within the purview of what Sībawayh considered eloquent
and correct Arabic and he thought of a too liberal use of vowel harmony to be
more problematic than its absence.

The Extra Vowels of Early Classical Arabic
The medieval Arab grammarians, and with them many modern scholars of the
Arabic language, conceive of ʔimālah as a shifting from an original ā towards
the ī, ending up generally in between the two, i.e. ē. While from a histori-
cal linguistic perspective this is true for a part of what the Arab grammar-
ians call ʔimālah, it certainly is not true for all of what they collect under
this label. Lack of awareness of this has led many a scholar (e.g. Levin 1992)

chapter 2
to the incorrect conclusion that in terms of the phonology of the vowel sys-
tem of Classical Arabic from Sībawayh’s lifetime onwards, there was a fairly
homogeneous system, namely, one that had three long vowels ā, ī and ū and
three short vowels a, i, u. In this interpretation ʔimālah would simply be allo-
phonic variation, and belong to the realm of phonetics rather than phonol-
ogy.
As we will see in this section, this is certainly not the case. Under the rubric
of what Sībawayh calls ʔimālah there are clear examples of what in modern
phonologicaltheorywouldbethoughtof asphonemicdistinctions;assuchSīb-
awayh describes forms of Arabic that have a phonemic fourth vowel ē besides
thethreebasevowels.Someof thesedistinctionsaremaintainedintheQuranic
reading traditions and, moreover, one of these systems corresponds to the
fourth long vowel ē that can be deduced to exist in the language of the qct on
the basis of orthography and Quranic rhyme (Van Putten (2017a), §3.3.3 and
§5.8). For a useful translation of Sībawayh’s chapters on ʔimālah see the trans-
lations and analysis of Sara (2007).
Besides this, the early Grammarians also speak of a back vowel in between
ā and ū, that is, ō (called ʔalif al-Tafxīm by Sībawayh) and even a front rounded
vowel ü and its long equivalent ǖ. None of these variants are presented as
incorrect Arabic, and significantly increase the phonological vowel inventory
compared to what we might call Classical Arabic.
2.2.2.1
i-umlaut
Sībawayh discusses ʔimālah at length, and within this discussion one type of
ʔimālah, namely the shift of ā to ē in the vicinity of i/ī, is most dominant.
This shift is blocked whenever there are emphatic or uvular consonants (ṣ, ḍ,
ṭ, ẓ, ġ, q, x) adjacent to the ā or following it, but is not blocked if the umlaut-
triggering i stands between the blocking consonant and a following ā such as
in XiCāC stems where X is one of these blocking consonants (Sībawayh 1988,
iv, 117–120; 127–136; Sara 2007, 9–16; 56–65; 121–122, 133–134).2 The consonant r
holds a special position in this ʔimālah. It behaves as an emphatic ṛwhen fol-
lowed by ā or when it is preceded by ā and not followed by i or ī. As a result,
this blocks the ʔimālah: ṛāšid, ḥimāṛun but not of min ḥimēri-ka. Interestingly,
the sequence āri > ēri is stronger than blocking emphatic consonants. Thus,
one says qērib ‘boat’, ṭērid ‘expeller’. Likewise nouns with the shape CaCāC and
2 Close parallels of this type of i-umlaut ʔimālah are well-attested in many modern Arabic
dialects, for example in Christian and Jewish Baghdadi (Blanc 1964, 42). For an in-depth dis-
cussion on the parallels of Sībawayh’s i-umlaut ʔimālah and what we find attested in the
modern dialects see also Levin (1992).

CuCāC, which normally block ʔimālah if the genitive follows, undergo ʔimālah
when the last root consonant is r.
This type of ʔimālah seems to have been widespread, as Sībawayh only tells
usthat“thepeopleof theHijazapplyʔimālahtononeof these”(Sara2007,12f.).
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 22) does not comment in great detail on this type of ʔimālah,
mentioning only al-kāfirūna is pronounced as such by the people of the Hijaz
while some of the people of Najd among the Tamīm and Qays say al-kēfirūna.
This simple i-umlaut does not create a distinction between a phonemic ā and
ē, but should rather be considered a purely allophonic alternation. The table
below provides an overview of examples cited by Sībawayh.

This type of ʔimālah is no longer common in Classical Arabic pronunciation
today. In fact, it receives no mention at all in many modern grammatical works,
such as Fischer (2002), or it is explained as a behaviour of “later times” (Wright
1896, §6c) despite the earliest grammarian describing it, clearly marking it as
part of the ʕarabiyyah. It is described in great detail by Sībawayh, and it is not
dismissed as ‘wrong’ or ‘less regular’. In fact, Sībawayh does not express any
negative judgement of such forms at all. He only tells us that the people of the
Hijazdonot doit.Wemustthereforeconcludethatusingthistypeof pronunci-
ation was considered acceptable and part of the linguistic variation present in
the ʕarabiyyah that Sībawayh sought to describe. In fact, about a century later
the Basran grammarian al-Mubarrad (d. 285/898) explicitly evaluates the use
of ʔimālah as better (Muqtaḍab iii, 42), showing that this is not just a non-
standard feature that happened to end up in grammarian descriptions, but
rather is part of the variation that can be explicitly endorsed.
2.2.2.2
iii-y ʔimālah
The i-umlaut ʔimālah as discussed above can be plausibly thought of as the
allophonic realization of ā, as it is predictable when it does and does not occur.

chapter 2
However, there are several other forms of ʔimālah that certainly cannot be con-
sidered allophonic, but must describe a true phonemic fourth long vowel ē that
existed beside ā, ī and ū. Sībawayh says that this type of iii-yʔimālah is uncom-
mon both among the Tamīm and others (Sībawayh, iv, 120; Sara 2007, 20f.),
while al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 21f.) says that many of the people of Najd apply it.These
statements appear to be contradictory, and their respective descriptions also
differ somewhat.
Sībawayh points out that nouns that have a root final consonant w do not
undergo ʔimālah. Hence you getقفاqafā ‘back’,عصاʕaṣā ‘stick’القناal-qanā ‘the
aquiline nose’ andالقطاal-qaṭā ‘the sand grouse’. This is different from those
with root-final yāʔ, which do undergo ʔimālah (no examples given, but e.g.
الهوىal-hawē ‘the affection’ andالفتىal-fatē ‘the youth’). Feminine nouns that
have the suffix -ā (spelled with yāʔ) are likewise treated as nouns that have a
root final yāʔ:معزىmiʕzē ‘nanny goat’ andحبلىḥublē ‘pregnant’. Derived forms
that end in -ā (spelled with yāʔ) likewise always undergo ʔimālah, as derived
stems shift their root final consonant from w to y (as can be seen in the dual,
suchasʔaʕṭayā‘they(dual)gave’butʕaṭawāni ‘twogifts’).Hence,wefindmuʕṭē
‘gifted’.
Where nouns (for those who apply this type of ʔimālah) have a distinction
between root final wāw and root final yāʔ stems, Sībawayh says this is not the
case for verbs. Henceغزاġazē ‘he raided’,صفاṣafē ‘it became clear’ andدعاdaʕē
‘he called’, just like e.g.رمىramē ‘he threw’ andبنىbanē ‘he built’.
He explicitly adds that this final weak ʔimālah is not blocked by emphatic
consonants, thus you have muʕṭē ‘gifted’ and saqē ‘he watered’ (Sībawayh, iv,
132; Sara 2007, 66f.), clearly indicating that we are not dealing with an allo-
phonic shift from ā to ē similar to the i-umlaut ʔimālah discussed in the pre-
vious section. Moreover, there are places where the occurrence of ā and ē
cannot be reconstructed from surface forms like *al-fatā and *al-ʕaṣā, so we
must conclude that for the variety that Sībawayh describes to have this type of
ʔimālah we are dealing with a phonemic distinction between ā and ē. Compar-
ative Semitic evidence, most notably the epigraphic old Arabic dialect of the
Safaitic inscriptional corpus and Classical Ethiopic show that the long vowel
distinction between iii-w and iii-y stems is the outcome of two etymologi-
cally different sequences (see van Putten 2017a for a discussion). Thus, the
contrastive vowels of al-fatē and al-ʕaṣā come from *al-fatayu and *al-ʕaṣawu
respectively.
While this etymological distinction is retained in the noun, according to Sīb-
awayh, it is lost in the verb.This is rather surprising, as we would expect that, as
withthenoun,original*banayaand*daʕawawouldyieldbanēanddaʕā,some-
thing that is also reflected in Classical Arabic orthography. Sībawayh seems to

be quite alone among the early grammarians in maintaining that the verb must
lack this distinction. Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 21) tells us that “many among the peo-
ple of the Najd apply ʔimālah [lit.: place an i-vowel] when they say qaḍē, ramē
and sawwē, and they place an a vowel on roots with wāw as the third root con-
sonant, for example in wa-ʔiḏā xalā baʕḍu-hum (Q2:76) and mā zakā (Q24:21),
and what is like it.” Al-Mubarrad (iii, 44) explicitly states that ʔimālah is ugly
in iii-w verbs (qabīḥah) in **daʕē, **ġazē and **ʕadē, although it might be
barely acceptable (qad yaǧūzu ʕalā buʕd), while for iii-y verbs it is considered
good (ḥasanah) be it a noun, verb, or adjective. Sībawayh’s student, al-ʔaxfaš al-
ʔawṣat (d. 215/830) endorses both contradictory statements, he says that many
of the Arabs (kaṯīran mina l-ʕarab; Maʕānī, 41) did not apply ʔimālah to forms
to iii-w verbs, while many (other) people (nāsun kaṯīr; Maʕānī, 42) did apply it
to verbs with wāw.
There is yet another system of final weak ʔimālah that Sībawayh discusses
as somewhat of an afterthought, but from a modern dialectological perspec-
tive highly relevant. As Levin (“Sībawayh’s ʾImāla”, 87) points out, besides the
system where iii-y and iii-w verbs are merged towards having ʔimālah while
nouns remain distinct, there also seem to be dialects where the iii-y/w verb
merged towards not having ʔimālah and only has ʔimālah on the nouns with
the feminine ending -ē/-ā, as examples Sībawayh (iv, 126) cites speakers who
say ramā ‘he threw’ but ḥublē ‘pregnant’ miʕzē ‘goat’. As Levin points out, this
corresponds with the ʔimālah as we find it in the Mesopotamian Qəltu dialects
which have ḥəble ‘pregnant’, ʔaʕme ‘blind’ but ramā ‘he threw’, retaining the
ancient vowel contrast.

While Sībawayh reports final weak ʔimālah to be a minority pronunciation, it
is in no way judged to be incorrect or less eloquent. Al-Farrāʔ does express a
normative preference, but infavour of distinguishing ā and ē saying “the best of
that is the case when it is between the strong application of kasr and the strong
application of fatḥ, and following this are most of the Arabs and Quranic read-

ers.”3 This clearly indicates that normatively it is better to pronounce the iii-y
verbs with something that is not identical to a pure ā vowel.
This once again shows that we certainly cannot project back the later norms
of Classical Arabic to this period. As far as al-Farrāʔ is concerned, the norma-
tive pronunciation of Arabic is with four separate phonemic long vowels ā, ī, ū
and ē.4
2.2.2.3
ii-w/y ʔimālah
In his chapter on ʔimālah, Sībawayh (iv, 120f.) tells us that “they apply ʔimālah”
to hollow verbs, whose 1sg. form has an i vowel, be they ii-w or ii-y (e.g.
xēfa/xiftu ‘to fear’, ǧēʔa/ǧiʔtu ‘to come’). He also adds that this is a linguistic
practice for some of the people of the Hijaz. It seems clear that the “they” he
refers to more generally in this section are not the people of the Hijaz, as earlier
he tells us that “the people of the Hijazi do not apply ʔimālah to all of this” (iv,
118). Further dialectal specification of this type of ʔimālah is not given, but al-
Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 17) adds that it is the practice of the common people of the Najd
among the Tamīm, ʔasad and Qays.
This, once again, cannot be understood as an allophonic alternation be-
tween ā and ē. One cannot predict from the surface form without ʔimālah
whether it will have ā or ē, nor is it conditioned by the presence or absence
of emphasis. Instead, it represents two outcomes of etymologically distinct
forms of the verb, verbs with a medial triphthong *aWi yielding ē and *aWu
(or *aWa) yielding ā (where W is a w or y). That these verbs once had triph-
thongs in medial position is quite clear from the Old Arabic dialect reflected
in the Safaitic inscriptions, where such verbs often remain uncontracted with
a consonantal y or w (Al-Jallad 2015, 119). For example, we find byt ‘he spent the
night’, ʿwd ‘he returned’ and rwḥ‘he departed at night’. Safaitic does not make
use of matreslectionis,andthereforethispoints toformslike/bayita/,/ʕawada/
and /rawaḥa/ respectively. The original triphthongs of these hollow roots are
further confirmed by forms like Gəʕəz kona < *kawuna, and Suchard (2016)
shows that a triphthongal origin can also be reconstructed for Proto-Hebrew.
This then retains an archaic contrast that is absent in Classical Arabic. The
examples with the hollow root ʔimālah as discussed here must be a different

ʕarabi wa-l-qurrāʔ.
4 Considering that his teacher al-Kisāʔī and subsequently also his teacher Ḥamzah both retain
a phonemic distinction between ē and ā in iii-y and iii-w verbs respectively in their Quranic
readings (see §3.3.3.3), it is of course not surprising that al-Farrāʔ would consider this the
better practice.

outcome from the collapse of these triphthongs, rather than an unmotivated
shift from *ā > ē.
Unlike the final weak verbs, where the root consonant determines the out-
come of ē versus ā, for hollow roots, it is the second stem vowel that determines
the outcome of this collapse. This much is clear from verbs such as mēta, mittu
whose verbal noun mawt leaves little doubt that the root is, in fact, √mwt, and
the same can be said for xēfa, xiftu whose verbal noun is xawf beside forms
such as ṣēra, ṣirtu with a verb noun ṣayr. This is similar to the Hebrew situation
where we find meṯ‘he died’ but mawɛṯ‘death’, which Suchard argues means we
must reconstruct *mawita and *mawt with a collapse of *awi in the hollow root
to ē. A similar development must be envisioned for forms of Arabic with this
type of ʔimālah.
Note that this shift does not necessarily take place in varieties that also
have an ā/ē distinction for the iii-w/y verbs. Sībawayh attributes this ii-w/y
ʔimālah to the poet Kuṯayyir ʕazzah (Sara 2007, 22f.), an Umayyad poet whom
he quoted in the previous section for not having ʔimālah for iii-w/y verbs. The
reverse is also true: the dialect on which the Quranic and classical orthography
was based clearly only had ā for ii-w/y verbs, hence the consistent spelling with
ʔalif whereas iii-w/y are kept strictly distinct (see §5.8).
While Sībawayh considers this a rare feature, it is in no way considered bad
and is indeed qualified by citing an early Umayyad poet. Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 17),
like with the previous feature, explicitly endorses having this type of contrast,
in very similar wording as in the previous section, saying: “the best of that is
the case when it is between the excessive application of kasr and the exces-
sive application of fatḥ. ʕāṣim applies the fatḥexcessively, and Ḥamzah the
kasr excessively.”5 As al-Farrāʔ only mentions Quranic readers here and does
not say that most of the Arabs do it this way, this statement should perhaps
be interpreted as only being normative for Quranic recitation, rather than
for spoken ʕarabiyyah. What is clear, however, is that neither Sībawayh nor
al-Farrāʔ considered this practice as incorrect or not belonging to the ʕara-
biyyah.
2.2.2.4
The Fifth Long Vowel Ō
While Sībawayh spends very few words on the presence of a backed and
rounded counterpart to the mid front vowel ē, that is, a long ō, it is clear from
his account that it existed. In a list of sounds that are not basic to the Arabic

alphabet but acceptable for the recitation of the Quran and poetry, Sībawayh
(iv, 432) speaks of an ʔalif al-tafxīm typical of the people of the Hijaz in the
words aṣ-ṣalōh ‘the prayer’, az-zakōh ‘the alms’ and al-ḥayōh ‘the life’.While this
has been interpreted by Rabin (1951, 107) as a general tendency to pronounce
any long ā as ō in the Hijaz, that is clearly not what Sībawayh is referring to.6
The three words Sībawayh cites are exactly the words that are spelled with a
wāw in the orthography of the Quranic Consonantal Text,7 i.e.الصلوه ,الزكوهand
الحيوه
.To this we can add several other words such asمنوهmanōh ‘Manāt’,غدوه
ġadōh ‘morning’ andالنجوهan-naǧōh ‘escape’. There are good reasons to think
that these were indeed pronounced with an ō in Quranic Arabic (see Al-Jallad
2017c; van Putten 2017a), and it can hardly be an accident that it is exactly these
words that Sībawayh decided to cite. Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 45f.) is aware of such a
pronunciation, and states that it is said that the eloquent ones of the people
Yemen pronounce it aṣ-ṣalōh and az-zakōh, but that he has not heard it him-
self, this may suggest that this pronunciation was already losing popularity by
his lifetime.
This ō vowel once again does not develop from ā, but rather has a clearly
distinct etymological origin (nouns ending in *-awat-) (see Al-Jallad 2017c; van
Putten2017a),andshouldthereforebeconsideredphonemicamongstspeakers
that have this ʔalif al-tafxīm. This introduces a fifth long vowel, which, more-
over, is explicitly considered acceptable by Sībawayh for the recitation of the
Quran. It was clearly part of at least some people’s speech whose pronuncia-
tion Sībawayh respected, and considered this authoritative enough to use it in
Quranic recitation.
2.2.2.5
The Front Rounded Vowel in Hollow Passives
The passives of hollow roots are reported by Sībawayh (iv, 342f.) to come in
three different forms: He starts with the Classical Arabic qīla/qiltu, but then
adds that “some arabs” say xǖfa/xüftu, bǖʕa/büʕtu and qǖla/qültu, applying
6 This belief seems to stem from generalized and abridged statements of later grammarians.
Al-Mubarrad, for example, copies much of the same wording of Sībawayh considering the
sounds that exist in Arabic, but simply mentions the ʔalif al-tafxīm, while leaving out the
words that serve as an example of the ʔalif al-tafxīm as well as the dialectal origin (Al-
Mubarrad muqtaḍab, i, 330), this is likewise the case for Ibn al-Sarrāǧ (ʔuṣūl, iii, 487). This
lack of precision in later sources should, of course, not be seen as evidence that Sībawayh
was wrong and the general statement should be accepted. Ibn al-Sarrāǧ’s wording is copied
verbatim from Sībawayh’s al-Kitāb, but has only been abridged. The removal of the reference
to the words and tribal identification are simply part of the abridgement process.
7 The edition of al-Kitāb I consulted spells them with ʔalif.

lip rounding ( fa-yušimmu)8 and “some arabs” say xūfa/xufta, būʕa/buʕtu and
qūla/qultu. While Sībawayh does not specify which dialects use which forms,
al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 14) does: The people of the Hijaz apply the kasrah: qīla/qiltu;
Many of the Qays, ʕuqayl and the common people of ʔasad hint towards the
ḍammah of the qāf (yušīrūna ʔilā ḍammati l-qāf ) qǖla/qültu and Faqʕas and
Dubayr (branches of ʔasad) say qūla/qultu. No specific preference of one form
over the other is expressed.9
There is no way to derive at qǖla or qūla from qīla historically, and all three
reflexes must be seen as different outcomes of the original triphthong *quwila.
Rabin (1951, 159) provides a plausible scenario for these outcomes. He suggests
that all the dialects described by the grammarians first underwent a shift of
*uWi > ǖ. Subsequently in the Hijaz, this ǖ shifted to ī retaining the frontness
but losing the rounding, whereas Faqʕas and Dubayr shifted it to ū, losing the
frontness but retaining the rounding. The central dialects of Qays, ʕuqayl and
the majority of ʔasad retained the front rounded vowel. But different explana-
tions of the facts may be envisioned as well. The Hijaz and Qays/ʕuqayl/ʔasad
forms may have been the outcome of separate collapses of the triphthongs.
In Classical Arabic only the qīla form has survived, although Fischer (2002,
§246.3) notes that forms like qūla may occur in poetry.
2.2.3
Najdi Vowel Harmony
One of the phenomena that is attributed to a development in the language
of the Tamīm by Sībawayh (iv, 107–109), is the vowel harmony triggered by a
sequence of aGi or aGī, where G stands for an intervening guttural consonant,
ʔ, h, ḥ, ʕ, x, ġ.This affects nouns, adjectives and verbs alike.10 Forms he cites are:
8
ʔišmām as lip rounding is clearly explained by Sībawayh (iv, 168–176) in one of the chap-
ters on pause, where it is described as an option for pausing on nouns that end in -u.
9
What Sībawayh does say, however, is that the qīla/qiltu form is the “origin” (ʔaṣl). This is a
technical term which in Sībawayh’s framework means it is the form from which all forms
are derived. But this technical term cannot be understood as meaning the “normative” or
“Classical Arabic” form. Taking the term ʔaṣl as meaning the “normative” form would not
result in Classical Arabic. To Sībawayh, for example, unharmonized and long -hū and -
humū, naʕima/baʔisa rather than niʕma/biʔsa and wa-li-yaktub instead of wa-l-yaktub are
all described as the ʔaṣl but do not make it into the Classical Arabic norm. As Sībawayh’s
approach is not historical, ʔaṣl can of course not be understood as “origin” in the historical
linguistic sense either.
10
Many modern dialects, as for example Egyptian Arabic, show the exact opposite distribu-
tion:if thereisnoadjacentgutturaltheadjectiveisCiCīC,whereaswithagutturaladjacent
it is CaCīC, e.g. kibīr ‘big’ but saʕīd ‘happy’. In the modern Arabic dialect of Sanaa, how-
ever, we find the exact distribution that is described by Sībawayh (Julien Dufour personal
correspondence).

– šihid, liʕib, ḍiḥik, niġil, wixim, miḥik, lihim, wiʕik, xiʔiz, niʕir, fixiḏ
In the speech of the people of the Hijaz, however, this vowel harmony does not
take place. Again, both options are mentioned, but no specific preferences are
expressed for either form.
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 5) discusses this same shift for CaGīC nouns, reporting that
HijazisandʔasadretaintheabutthatQays,Tamīm,Rabīʕahandthosethatsur-
round them say riḥīm, biʕīr, liʔīm, bixīl, riġīf and šihīd. He does not discuss the
treatment of CaGiC stems in a systematic way, but comments on several cases
where it has clearly taken place. For example, he attributes niʕim-mā to Qays
andTamīm, while he attributes naʕim-mā to the Hijaz (Luġāt, 41). He mentions
that some of the Tamīm say ṭihirta for tahirṭa (Luġāt, 125). He also mentions
Tamīmī ar-riḥm for Hijazi ar-raḥim (Luġāt, 128) with Najdi syncope (see next
section).11 Once again the grammarians present the two forms as coming from
different dialects, but no specific preference is expressed for the ʕarabiyyah.
In Classical Arabic, however, such harmonized forms have disappeared com-
pletely.
2.2.4
Najdi Syncope
Both Sībawayh (iv, 113–115) and al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 29) report a far-reaching syn-
cope of the high vowels i and u when they are preceded by a light syllable (Cv).
Al-Farrāʔ reports this for the people of Najd, while Sībawayh specifies it more
and says that it is the linguistic practice of the Bakr b. Wāʔil and many people
of the Banū Tamīm. Al-Farrāʔ attributes the full pronunciation to the people of
the Hijaz, whereas Sībawayh does not specify what dialect has the full pronun-
ciation.
Al-Farrāʔmentionsthreecategoriestowhichthisdevelopmentapplies:first,
to the pronouns huwa and hiya when preceded by wa-, fa- and la-; second, to
nouns of the shapes CaCiC, CaCuC, CuCuC, CiCiC and feminine equivalents;

itlymentionedbyal-Farrāʔ,SībawayhaddsthatitalsoappliesinCaCiC,CaCuC,
and CuCiC verbs, as well as derived verbs that may have the CaCiC sequence.
The development presented by Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ clearly represents a reg-
ular sound law that can be formally represented as follows: *i, *u > ∅/Cv.C_. I
will discuss the four categories listed by al-Farrāʔ and Sībawayh separately.

2.2.4.1
Syncope in the Verbs
Sībawayh (iv, 113) shows that among the dialects that undergo this syncope, it
regularly applies in the verb. As examples he cites forms like karuma →karma
‘he is noble’, ʕalima →ʕalma ‘he knew’, fuṣida →fuṣda ‘he was bled’ and ʕuṣira
→ʕuṣra ‘it was squeezed’.
He also reports some cases where the CvCu/iC sequence is not followed by
a short vowel, and adding an epenthetic vowel to aid word-final CC cluster or
CCC cluster that is created. Thus, he lists forms like lam yalid-hū →lam yald-hū
→lam yalda-hū ‘he begot him’ and inṭaliq →inṭalq →inṭalqa ‘be free!’. Whether
these reports should be understood as exceptional cases, or that the sound law
described here is actually independent of the second vowel being in an open
syllable, is not entirely clear.
In the following chapter, Sībawayh (iv, 116) points out that CaGiCa verbs
that underwent vowel harmony to CiGiCa are also typical of the dialect of the
Tamīm(see§2.2.3aboveforadiscussion).Thesetooundergosyncope,butonly
after the vowel harmony. Thus, one gets forms like šahida →šihida →šihda ‘he
witnessed’, laʕiba →liʕiba →liʕba ‘he played’, naʕima →niʕima →niʕma ‘he is
glad’ and baʔisa →biʔisa →biʔsa ‘he is miserable’.
Al-Farrāʔ discusses this development in a less systematic way, but discus-
sions of it can be found throughout Luġāt al-Qurʔān. He reports that Rabīʕah
and Tamīm drop the i in fuʕila passives, citing ʕufya and quḍya ‘it is settled’ as
examples(al-Farrāʔ Luġāt,41).TheHijaziformḥasuna‘heisnice,good’isḥasna
among the Tamīm (al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 56). The broader application of this syn-
cope, even affecting words other than CaCuC, CaCiC and CuCiC stems is made
clear by the fact that al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 38) mentions that some of the Tamīm
say yaǧdu ‘he finds’ and lam ʔaǧdi/a ‘I didn’t find’ for yaǧidu and lam ʔaǧid.
These forms discussed by Sībawayh are the result of regular sound laws that
allow us to develop a relative chronology of the developments of the vowel
harmony followed by the syncope. As with other cases of variation described
by the Grammarians, the unsyncopated forms are not presented as ‘better’ or
standard. Rather, both forms are considered part of the ʕarabiyyah. In Classical
Arabic syncopated forms do not usually occur, the only place where they occur
is when the verbs naʕima ‘he is glad’ and baʔisa ‘he is miserable’ are employed
as pseudo-verbs of emphatic qualification, such as niʕmar-raǧulu ‘what a won-
derful man!’ and biʔsa n-nisāʔu ‘what evil women!’ (Fischer 2002, §259–263).
This lexical exception of these two verbs is typical of Classical Arabic but is not
described by Sībawayh or al-Farrāʔ for the ʕarabiyyah.

2.2.4.2
Syncope in Nouns
While al-Farrāʔ does not refer explicitly to the application of this syncope in
the context of verbs, he and Sībawayh both mention its application in nouns.
It affects such words as faxiḏ→faxḏ‘thigh’,12 kabid →kabd ‘liver’, ʕaḍud →
ʕaḍd ‘upper arm’, raǧul →raǧl ‘man’. When the vowel in the first syllable is a
high vowel, we see the same development. Thus qudus →quds ‘holiness’ (al-
Farrāʔ, Luġāt, 44) and huzuʔ →huzʔ ‘mockery’ (al-Farrāʔ, Luġāt, 26), ʕunuq →
ʕunq ‘neck’ aṭ-ṭunub →aṭ-ṭunb ‘tent rope’ and ʔibil →ʔibl ‘camels’. Even CuCuC
plural formations are affected, and thus we see ar-rusul →ar-rusl ‘prophets’,
ḥumur →ḥumr ‘donkeys’, xumur →xumr ‘veils’, ʔuzur →ʔuzr ‘wraps’ and furuš
→furš ‘pillows’ (Sībawayh, iii, 601). Derived nouns that have the expected envi-
ronment undergo this development according to Sībawayh (although al-Farrāʔ
never cites cases of such forms). Thus Sībawayh (iv, 115) cites muntafixan >
muntafxan ‘swollen’.
For simple noun stems in Classical Arabic, syncopated forms are still quite
frequent but always exist side-by-side with unsyncopated byforms: thus one
finds mention in lexicons and grammars of forms like kabd besides kabid, ʕunq
beside ʕunuq and ʔibl besides ʔibil, and even for plural forms mention is made
of kutbbesideskutub(e.g.Fischer2002,§88.2).However,thesebyformsarepre-
sented as fully lexicalized and optional in the language.The regular application
of syncope is no longer recognized and forms like muntafxan < muntafixan do
not seem to occur.
2.2.4.3
Pronouns
The pronouns huwa and hiya do not normally undergo syncope as they stand
at the beginning of a word, but when preceded by wa-, fa- or la-, the phonetic
environment is created where it would syncopate in the dialects of Najd, thus
you get wa-hwa, fa-hya and la-hya. Al-Farrāʔ explicitly connects this practice
to the Najdi dialects, whereas Sībawayh (iv, 151) is a bit more circumspect, and
says: “the hāʔ is quiesced when a wāw, or fāʔ or lām stands before it, and that is
your speech: wa-hwa ḏāhib, wa-lahwa xayrun mink, fa-hwa qāʔim. And it is like
that for hiya […], so they drop the vowel like they drop it in faxiḏin →faxḏin
[etc.]”.13Those that drop the vowel in faxiḏ→faxḏas we saw in section §2.2.4.2
are the people of Najd.
12
One would expect fixḏhere for dialects that have the Najdi vowel harmony. It seems that
the syncope affected more dialects than those that underwent the vowel harmony.

In Classical Arabic the normal forms are huwa and hiya, although Fischer
(2002, §264.3) still makes note of the possibility to syncopate after wa- and fa-
as an option. For the grammarians we discussed here, it is not presented as a
free option. Instead, it is clearly presented as the outcome of a regular devel-
opment that takes place among eastern dialects; and it is not expected to see
formslike wa-hwainformsof ClassicalArabicthatdonotalsohavekutb‘books’
and ʕalma ‘he knows’.
2.2.4.4
Li- + Apocopate for Commands
Another connection with the syncope that both Sībawayh (iv, 151f.) and al-
Farrāʔ (Luġāt 29) provide is the treatment of the li- of command (lām al-ʔamr).
When this form is combined with an apocopate, it represents a command, for
example li-yaʔti ‘let him come!’ li-naʔxuḏ‘let us take!’ (Fischer 2002, §195).This
li- of command can be preceded by wa- ‘and’ and fa- ‘so’. As was the case with
wa-huwa and fa-hiya, the i of li- now stands in the phonetic environment that
would undergo syncope in the Najdi dialects, both grammarians, comparing it
with the other forms of syncope discussed so far, say that it is possible to elide
this vowel, thus yielding forms like fa-l-yanẓur ‘so let him see!’ and wa-l-yaḍrib
‘and let him hit!’ However, Sībawayh explicitly states that whoever leaves the
vowel in hiya and huwa untouched also leaves the vowel in li- untouched. In
other words, he explicitly describes the forms fa-li-yanẓur and wa-li-yaḍrib for
those that do not apply syncope.
This is rather different from the situation that we find in Classical Arabic.
Where most of the cases described above, the standard prefers the unsynco-
pated forms, in this case the syncopation is obligatory, whereas forms like fa-li-
yanẓur, as explicitly endorsed by Sībawayh in non-syncopating dialects, is not
considered part of the Classical Arabic language (Fischer 2002, §195.1).
2.2.4.5
Conclusions on the Syncope
As should be clear from the above discussion, both Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ
make clear and consistent references to the existence of a syncopation rule
of the high vowels i and u in the ʕarabiyyah of Najd, this rule can be formu-
lated formally as *i, *u > ∅/Cv.C_. The varieties that have this form are by no
means considered a ‘deviation’ from the norm, they are part of the normative
construct of the ʕarabiyyah that both authors seek to describe.
While in the varieties described by these grammarians the sound law sim-
ply applies regularly in those dialects that undergo it, surprisingly in the later
Classical Arabic standard, the situation is very mixed. CvCi/uC nominal stems,
both as singulars and plurals, make it into this emergent norm in syncopated
and unsyncopated forms, although the lack of syncopation seems to be pre-

ferred. For verbs, this allowance of syncopation is unheard of except for the
verbs naʕima and baʔisa where the syncopated forms, having undergone vowel
harmony as well, niʕma and biʔsa, and have become specialized as particles
of emphatic qualification. For the pronouns both forms are possible, but the
unsyncopated form dominates. Finally, for the li- of command, only the syn-
copated form wins out. It should be clear from these many differences that the
ʕarabiyyahthattheseearlygrammariansdescribeissignificantlydifferentfrom
the standard language that eventually becomes dominant.
2.2.5
Barth-Ginsberg Alternation in the Prefix Vowel
The Barth-Ginsberg alternation, first identified as a morphological pattern
found in Hebrew and Aramaic, states that stative verbs in the prefix-conjuga-
tion that have a root vowel a will have a prefix vowel i, whereas those that
have a root vowel u or i will have a prefix vowel a. Thus, yiCCaC versus yaC-
CiC and yaCCuC. Bloch (1967) convincingly shows that this Barth-Ginsberg
alternation was not just a development found in Hebrew and Aramaic, but
also a pattern that Sībawayh—and with him many other Arab grammarians—
describes for the ʕarabiyyah. Since Bloch’s revolutionary article, it has become
clear that the same alternation is found not only in Classical Arabic, but also
in several modern dialects (Najdi Arabic, Ingham (1994, 23f.); and traces in,
for example, Maltese, see Van Putten (2020c)) and pre-Islamic Arabic (Al-
Jallad and al-Manaser 2015). It is therefore beyond doubt that this alternation
shouldbereconstructedforProto-Arabic,andsubsequentlymustbepartof the
shared ancestor of Hebrew, Aramaic and Arabic, that is—at the latest—central
Semitic.14
Sībawayh (iv, 110–113) considers the use of the Barth-Ginsberg alternation
typical for all Arabs except those of the Hijaz. Thus, one says ʔiʕlamu ‘I know’
but ʔaktubu ‘I write’ and ʔaḍribu ‘I hit’. This high vowel prefix occurs with every
person prefix except the ya- used for the 3sg.m., and the 3rd person plural/dual
forms.15 Bloch (1967, 24) suggests that this is the result of an Arabic-internal
dissimilation of the sequence *yi- > ya-. Further evidence that the inclusion
of the yi- form is the original situation is found in the fact that certain words
where the yi shifted to yī the dissimilation was avoided, and we simply find
14
Kossmann & Suchard (2018) make a compelling case that the Barth-Ginsberg alternation
may even go as far back as the shared ancestor of Berber and Semitic.
15
This is different from the way it behaves in present-day Najdi Arabic which has invariable
1sg. ʔa- but variable 3sg.m. ya-/yi- (Ingham 1994, 24f.). Hebrew, Aramaic, nor pre-Islamic
Arabic (Al-Jallad and al-Manaser 2015) seem to have the exception of the 3sg.m. form as
found in the ʕarabiyyah.

those original, such as in yīǧalu ‘he fears’ rather than yawǧalu and presum-
ably also yiʔbā which should likely be understood as a classicized version of
a hamzahless form of the verb yībā that likewise had the yī sequence blocking
the dissimilation.
Derived verbs that have a prefix with -a- in textbook Classical Arabic, such
asN-stem yanfaʕilu,Gt-stem yaftaʕilu,tD-stem yatafaʕʕalu,tL-stem yatafāʕalu
and Ct-stem yastafʕilu are all likewise reported to have the i-prefixes for these
dialects.
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 6–9) reports many of the same facts, but with more spe-
cific attribution: Qurayš and Kinānah always have a-vowel in derived stems (N,
Gt, tD, tL, Ct), e.g. nastaʕīnu; whereas Tamīm, ʔasad and Rabīʕah say nistaʕīnu,
ʔistaʕīnu, tistaʕīnu but yastaʕīnu. Al-Farrāʔ adds that Quranic reciters read
nistaʕīnu but also in G(i/a)-stems such as tirkanū, tišāʔūna, tixāfūna, tīmannā
[for taʔmanʷnā], ʔiʕhad, ʔīḏan, tiswadd and tiṭmaʔinna and other forms that
are like it.
Afterwards, referring to these Barth-Ginsberg forms, al-Farrāʔ says “I fol-
lowed in this manner, but the recitation follows the first (Hijazi) linguistic
practice”(ʔaǧraytu-hūʕalāhāḏāl-maǧrā,wa-l-qirāʔatubi-l-luġatil-ʔūlā).16This
confirms that such forms described by Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ are not just devi-
ations from some unspoken norm, but can even be part of the self-reported
speech of said grammarian.
Al-Farrāʔ continues to describe the rules in much the same way as Sīb-
awayh and tells us that for G-stems the prefix is ʔi-, ti-, ni- but ya- only in
the faʕila/yafʕalu. He explicitly adds that it is a mistake to say **tišrufu and
**tiḍribu, a practice widespread in modern dialects.17 For verbs that are faʕala/
yafʕalu, and thus are not stative verbs, one does not say **tiḏhabu etc. but
simply taḏhab, because the base verb is not a faʕila verb. Al-Farrāʔ adds that
al-Kisāʔī heard some of the Dubayr and ʔasad use i vowels there.
NeitherSībawayhnoral-FarrāʔspecificallyendorsetheHijaziabsenceof the
Barth-Ginsberg alternation as being the proper form of the ʕarabiyyah. In Clas-
sical Arabic, however, the Hijazi form without the Barth-Ginsberg alternation
has become the only acceptable pronunciation (Fischer 2002, §211.2; §241.3).

Classical Arabic is often said to have one petrified form with Barth-Ginsberg
alternation left, that is, ʔixālu ‘methinks’ (Bloch 1967, 27; Fischer 2002, §244.3;
Huehnergard 2017, 16). Indeed, Lisān al-ʕarab (1304c) considers ʔixālu, rather
than ʔaxālu the most eloquent, whereas the latter is analogous. Such a norma-
tive preference however does not appear at all with the early grammarians. In

2.2.6
The Deictic Pronominal System
Sībawayh (ii, 5, 77f.; iv, 182, 411) only has a few very short discussions on
the deictic pronominal system. Al-Farrāʔ describes the system in more detail
(Luġāt, 11, 12, 22, 94; Maʕānī, i, 109). Principally he identifies a Hijaz versus
Najd split, mentioning several forms that explicitly different between the two
regions, the differences have been summarized in the table below. Not every
form of the paradigm is mentioned explicitly, or assigned to one of the dialect
groups explicitly, I have taken the liberty to fill in these forms as seems most
likely, and placed them in square brackets.

on occasion used in poetry.

Sībawayh does mention the first-person plural form nixālu, the fact that he makes no spe-

2.2.7
Two Subsequent Hamzahs within a Single Word
Sībawayh (iii, 543ff.) describes the dropping of the hamzah in words like raʔs
> rās, ḏiʔb > ḏīb, buʔs > būs, ǧuʔan > ǧuwan and miʔar > miyar, etc. in great
detail, and he does not express any negative (or positive) opinion. It is simply
an option when speaking the ʕarabiyyah. In the norms as presented in our text-
books today, such forms are not recognized as being part of Classical Arabic at
all (Fischer (2002, §42, §43), although Wright (1896, §42) indeed describes the
option neutrally).
To Sībawayh (iii, 552), however, there is one environment in which the
dropping of the hamzah is obligatory, namely, when two hamzahs follow one
another. Thus, one says and ǧāʔin (←ǧāʔīn ←ǧāʔiyun ←ǧāʔiʔun) ‘going’. While
not mentioned explicitly, logically this also affects the verbs ʔaʔkulu →ʔākulu
andʔuʔallifu→ʔuwallifuandthepluralof ʔimām,i.e.ʔa.immah(forʔaʔimmah).
In Classical Arabic the development of ʔaʔkulu →ʔākulu is considered regular
(Fischer 2002, §40), whereas other cases are considered to take place only in
nouns (Fischer 2002, §41a) but is said not to occur in the I-ʔ verbs (Fischer
2002, §41a.1). Sībawayh makes no such distinction between nouns and verbs,
and instead presents it as a rule without exception. Al-Farrāʔ does not discuss
these cases.
2.3
Where is Classical Arabic?
From the discussion in the previous section (§2.2), we have seen that the early
grammarians did not establish a single norm as to what the ʕarabiyyah is.
Instead, they admit a wealth of possibilities, occasionally provided with tribal
attribution of certain features, but especially Sībawayh very often simply lists
the options without specification. The collection and descriptions of free vari-
ation in the ʕarabiyyah is a feature typical of the Arab grammarians—it seems
to have been part of the very endeavour of being a grammarian. Even if we
turn our attention to a grammarian as late as al-Zamaxšarī (d. 538/1144) in his
al-Mufaṣṣal fī al-Naḥw, we barely see any convergence towards a normative
standard in his description. In the chapter on ʔimālah, for example, he still
describes all the cases of phonemic ē found with Sībawayh, even closely fol-
lowing his description (al-Zamaxšarī mufaṣṣal, 158–160). Even so, judging from
vocalized Classical Arabic manuscripts that predate him, it seems quite clear
that what eventually become the prescriptive norms of Classical Arabic had by
his time been firmly established.
Rabin (1951, 13) explicitly sees much of the variation discussed above as
deviations from the standard: “[The Arab grammarians] never considered the

chapter 2
dialects as a form of speech in their own right, but as a collection of curious
deviations from the literary language. All their data are measured on Classical
Arabic.” This, however, reveals more about Rabin’s preconceived assumptions
about the goals of the grammarians and the homogeneity of Classical Arabic,
than it tells us about how the Arab grammarians discussed the possible linguis-
tic variation within the ʕarabiyyah. While it is certainly true that the grammar-
ians did not consider the dialects as forms of speech in their own right, it is not
true that they are presented as curious deviations from the literary language.
All of the variations they described is what they considered to be the literary
language. They do not describe them as deviations, but rather as an integral
part of the norm.
For example, as we have seen above, both Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ affirm that
eastern dialects tend to drop i and u in CvCi/u sequences. Never do we find
statements of the kind “the people of the Hijaz say katif, and the people of
Najd say katf, and the ʕarabiyyah is katif.” The description of the Hijazi and
Najdi forms is the ʕarabiyyah these grammarians seek to describe. This is often
explicit in Sībawayh’s writing; when he lists a set of options, he ends such a
discussion with a statement that all such options are ʕarabiyy. Even when he
explicitly calls one better (ʔaḥsan, ʔaǧwad), he will often end such a discussion
with a statement that the dispreferred form is Arabic too. We saw this in Sīb-
awayh’s discussion of the long -hū and -hī after long vowels and diphthongs.
While he considers the short forms better, “the full pronunciation is ʕarabiyy.”
At no point is a contrast made between the variation he describes and what the
ʕarabiyyah is supposed to be.
This necessarily leads us to perhaps an unintuitive conclusion to the mod-
ern reader: If one were to read the whole of Sībawayh’s Kitāb, one would not
learn how to speak a single “Classical Arabic”. Instead, one would have access to
an astounding amount of—often mutually exclusive—variants. In fact, if one
takes the statements of Sībawayh seriously, we would find that the forms con-
sidered part of the standard language today could simply not exist at all. As an
example, in Classical Arabic one would say taštahī-hi ‘she desires it’. However,
in section §2.2.1 we learned that harmonized -hi is proper to the dialects of
Najd, while in the Hijaz they would say -hū (or -hu), whereas in section §2.2.5
we learned that only the people in the Hijaz have ta- as a prefix of Gt-stems
while all other regions have ti-. Thus, one expects either taštahī-hū or tištahī-
hi; one cannot read the Arab grammarians and learn that the proper Classical
Arabic form is taštahī-hi, as they at no point explicitly prescribe that.
Still, one might wonder whether the prose of the grammarians themselves
wouldnotgiveawaywhattheyconsideredtobe‘thestandard’.Afterall,nomat-
ter which modern text edition of Sībawayh’s Kitāb one consults, these contain

all the features of standard Classical Arabic that we know today. But in light of
the dominant standard language ideologies present today, and indeed a homo-
geneous standard having been present for many centuries already, such text
editions are of course, quite meaningless. Relentless classicization of orthog-
raphy and linguistic features is rampant in modern text editing practices, as
well as historical copying practices.We do not have an autograph of Sībawayh’s
book,norof al-Farrāʔ’sworks.Copiesthathavecomedowntouspost-datetheir
lifetimes by centuries, and postdate the establishment of a fairly rigid classical
norm by centuries as well. As such, we simply cannot assume that the copies or
editions we have today are reliable reflections of the version of the ʕarabiyyah
they themselves adhered to. Without the strict rules of meter and rhyme, the
Classicizing trends which are already strongly present in poetry (C. Rabin 1955,
21), would have been even stronger in prose. I would argue that careful read-
ing of their works can at least lead to a plausible inference that the norms of
al-Farrāʔ and Sībawayh may have used in their own prose would have differed
from the modern Classical Standard, and also likely differed from one another.
Al-Farrāʔ explicitly endorses the option to make a phonemic distinction
between /ā/ and /ē/ in final-weak stems, saying this is most common among
the Arabs and the Qurrāʔ (see §2.2.2.2). This distinction was made in Quranic
recitation by his teacher al-Kisāʔī, al-Kisāʔī’s teacher Ḥamzah, and the teacher
of Ḥamzah,al-ʔaʕmaš(see§3.3.3.3).Thisphonemicdistinctionappearstohave
beenavenerableKufantradition.Iseenoapriorireasontoassumethatthissys-
tematic phonemic distinction was only adhered to by these Kufan philologers
in Quranic recitation. Al-Farrāʔ’s wording does not seem to imply that. Simi-
larly, I see no reason to assume that the lack of harmony of -hum when pre-
ceding ʔalif al-waṣl in, e.g. ʕalayhumu l-qawl can transparently be understood
as a practice exclusive to Quranic recitation. Al-Farrāʔ explicitly calls this prac-
tice ‘the most eloquent of linguistic practices’ (ʔafṣaḥal-luġāt), and something
that ‘al-Kisāʔī used to adopt’ (see §2.2.1). And indeed, it is also something other
Kufans like Ḥamzah and al-ʔaʕmaš adopted, at least in recitation (see §3.3.1).
Neither of these features is explicitly endorsed by Sībawayh, and from what
we know of the recitation of the Basran readers, it appears to have rather been
typical (at least in Quranic recitation) not to distinguish between /ā/ and /ē/
and say ʕalayhimi l-qawl with harmony of both the internal vowel and the con-
necting vowel (van Putten and Sidky forthcoming). Sībawayh seems to take the
‘base’ of the harmonized plural pronouns to be ʕalayhimī, which could be care-
fully taken as a possible indication that he would have indeed preferred the
ʕalayhimi l-qawl form. In light of these differences in description between Sīb-
awayh and al-Farrāʔ, which appear to align with regional practices of Quranic
recitation, it seems to me likely that these two grammarians would have dif-

fered in these features from one another in neutral prose, while both recog-
nizing each other’s options as part of the ʕarabiyyah. Whatever the case, it is
certainly unwarranted to assume that these two early grammarians would have
agreed on a single standard Classical Arabic norm—which they both neglected
to describe at all—when speaking and writing prose which just so happens
to agree exactly with the modern norms, while it explicitly differed on these
points compared to the strongly regional patterns in recitation.21
Despite the absence of an explicit normative position from the early gram-
marians, whenever modern scholarship speaks about the history of Arabic,
includingthelanguageof theQuran,theassumptionthatthestandardanduni-
form Classical Arabic was established by the grammarians—and understood
by all from the very beginning of the grammarian endeavour to have the lim-
ited subset of grammatical features—permeates all argumentation and leads
to conclusions that simply do not follow from the data. For example, Rabin
adduces that “the dialect of the Quraish must have been more unlike the Clas-
sical than the present-day colloquials […]. Had the Koran been composed in
eitherthedialectof Quraishorina“vulgartongue”,noamountof revisionwith-
out altering the consonantal outlines could have made it as similar to Classical
as it is.” (Rabin 1955, 26). Rabin assumed here that the Arab grammarians had
a clearly defined category of ʕarabiyyah versus the dialect of Qurayš, but this is
not at all what the grammarians present: The dialect of the Qurayš is the ʕara-
biyyah, as are the dialects of Najd. There is no description of Classical Arabic in
opposition to the descriptions of the dialects.
Despite the lack of a unified standard, modern Arabists consistently project
this homogeneous standard of Classical Arabic back to the period of the early
Grammarians or even earlier. For example, Blau & Hopkins (1987, §25.1) argue
that case must be absent in construct in the Judeo-Arabic papyri they study
because the 3rd plural masculine is־
הום
/-hum/, even in genitival position,
21
While the editing process and classicization certainly got rid of many of the more exotic
and pre-Classical linguistic features of the ʕarabiyyah in the writings of these early gram-
marians, occasionally traces of it appear to make it into the modern editions of the text.
For example, the short form of the apocopate of kāna as yaku, taku etc. rather than yakun
and takun is generally considered to be a typical feature of Quranic Arabic and poetry, but
atypical of the standard Classical Arabic prose that these grammarians are often assumed
to implicitly adhere to.Yet, al-Farrāʔ on multiple occasions in his Maʕānī in fact uses such
short forms in his own prose, and not in order to highlight this feature of Quranic Arabic
or the ʕarabiyyah, e.g. fa-ʔin yaku ka-ḏālika fa-yanbaġī ʔan yakūna ḥiṭṭatan manṣūbatan
fī l-qirāʔah “so if it is like that, then it should be recited as ḥiṭṭatan in the accusative” (al-
Farrāʔ Maʕānī i, 38) and fa-ʔin yaku muwāfiqan li-t-tafsīri fa-huwa ṣawāb “so if this is in
agreement with the explanation, then it is correct” (al-Farrāʔ Maʕānī i, 94).

where they say “according to Classical Arabic they should have contained i.”
The papyri they study were written around the same time that Sībawayh and
al-Farrāʔ are active as grammarians, and both grammarians find the unhar-
monized forms of the pronoun completely acceptable. Thus, saying that the
form with vowel harmony is the only option Classical Arabic “should” have, is
anachronistic.Itassumesalinguisticunityof ClassicalArabicthatisnotshown
to have existed and certainly is not presented as such by the early Arab gram-
marians.
Hopkins (2020, 72*) claims that “in Classical Arabic (ca), the final vowel -
ā is sometimes written with alif and sometimes written with yāˀ. According
to early grammarians, Quranic tajwīd and traditional pronunciation of ca, the
two spellings are in sound identical”. But early grammarians in fact describe
them as having different sounds (see §2.2.2.2), and even much later grammar-
ians like al-Zamaxšarī express no normative opinion that Hopkins ascribes to
the early grammarians.22
Another example is found in Blau (1967, §4.1) who interpretsسُلنا
“we were
asked” as a shift of i > u, apparently taking the hollow root passive silnā as the
ClassicalArabicform,although,accordingtotheearlygrammarians,forhollow
roots both CüCnā and CuCnā are admitted besides silnā (see §2.2.2.5).
Blau (1967, §8.3) likewise seems convinced that the li- of command always
has to syncopate when fa- precedes, when he says “the copyist (or the author),
… perhaps wrongly pronounced fali [instead of fa-l-, MvP].” However, fa-li-
yaktub rather than the now standard fa-l-yaktub was by no means considered
wrong by the early grammarians (see §2.2.4.4 and also §3.3.2.2).
However,itisnotjustthoseworkingonMiddleArabicthatanachronistically
project back later linguistic norms to the early Islamic period. Also, historical
linguistic work on modern dialects often takes the Classical Arabic standard
as the norm, subsequently misinterpreting archaisms in the dialects as innova-
tions. An example of this is Blanc (1964, 44) who describes the retention of iii-y
ʔimālah in Christian and Jewish Baghdadi—like ʔaʕmi ‘blind’ < ʔaʕmē, k(a)sāli
< kasālē ‘lazy’, bali ‘yes’ < balē and ḥəbli ‘pregnant’ < ḥublē—as shifts from Old
Arabic *ā to i, rather than clear evidence that these dialects developed from
varieties of Arabic that have a distinct phonemic ē in this position rather than
ā.
In order to understand the linguistic history of Arabic, the position of the
ʕarabiyyah within it and how we should understand the position of Middle
22
Incidentally, also the claim that the sounds are merged in taǧwīd is incorrect. Four of the
ten canonical readers keep them perfectly distinct, see §3.3.3.3.

Arabic and the modern dialects in relation to it, it is important not to essen-
tialize the ʕarabiyyah according to the rigid standard placed upon it today, but
rather with the diversity which the Arab grammarians described it.
2.4
Prescriptivism of the Grammarians
The lack of explicit prescriptivism in the early grammatical tradition concern-
ing a large amount of phonological, morphological and syntactic variation
should not be understood as evidence that the data presented by the gram-
marians is an uncurated representation of the dialects of Arabic. In fact, if we
compare what the grammarians describe to contemporary Arabic texts written
in scripts other than Arabic, we find one very striking difference: The Arabic of
this period, not filtered through the grammarian lens, lacks the full ʔiʕrāb and
tanwīn system which so quintessentially marks Classical Arabic and the ʕara-
biyyah. Some examples of such documents are the following:
(1)
The Damascus Psalm fragment, written in Greek letters, datable to right
aroundtheactiveperiodof theearliestgrammarians(endof the8th,early
9th century), seems to reflect a variety of Arabic that has mostly lost case,
occasionally reflecting a genitive in construct before pronominal suffixes
andusingamarker-āforadverbials.SeeAl-Jallad(2020b)foradiscussion.
(2)
The Arabic as reflected in Greek transcriptions of the 7th century has lost
all word-final short vowels and tanwīn, but retains evidence that ʔabū
‘father of’ was still inflected for case (Al-Jallad 2017d). The pre-Islamic
Graeco-Arabic material from the southern levant (around the 6th cen-
tury) reflects a similar situation (Al-Jallad 2017a).
(3)
The Judeo-Arabic papyri written in the early phonetic Judeo-Arabic spell-
ing, a purely phonetic orthography that does not calque Arabic orthog-
raphy, likely dated around the 8th or 9th century, show no sign of case
inflection save for the inflection of the ‘five nouns’, which are found in
the correct genitive forms in address lines (מין אכיחmin ʔaxī-h ‘from his
brother’;[לא[בי עמרין
[li-ʔa]bīʕimrēn23‘toʔabūʕimrān’;לאבי עליli-ʔabīʕalī
‘toʔabūʕalī’;לאבי יעקובli-ʔabiyaʕqūb‘toʔabūYaʕqūb’)(BlauandHopkins
1987).
(4)
The pre-Islamic Arabic written in the Safaitic script lacks tanwīn and
seems to have only retained the accusative -a for both definite and indef-
inite nouns, while word-final -u and -i had been lost (Al-Jallad and al-
23
Note the i-umlaut ʔimālah of a CiCCāC noun, as discussed above in section §2.2.2.1.

what is the ʕarabiyyah?

Manaser 2015; Al-Jallad 2015, 69f.). The pre-Islamic Arabic written in His-
maic script may have had all the case vowels, but likewise lacked tanwīn
(Al-Jallad 2020a).
Indeed, regardless of the period from which an Arabic manual of grammar
comes, one would hardly ever know that there was Arabic spoken at all with-
out ʔiʕrāb and tanwīn,24 if one would rely on just these grammars. In this sense
the Arab grammarians are highly, but only implicitly, prescriptive; there was
an essential part of Arabic variation and innovation present in what modern
linguists would call “Arabic” that completely escapes any acknowledgement by
the grammarians. Clearly to them any form of Arabic that did not have the full
system of ʔiʕrāb and tanwīn was not considered proper “Arabic”. This is also
clear from the word used to denote these Arabic-defining final case vowels:
ʔiʕrāb, as a causative verbal noun of the root √ʕrb, it is literally “the thing that
makes something Arabic”.
2.5
Conclusion
In this chapter we have examined several linguistic features described by the
early Arab grammarians Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ. From this discussion it is
clear that these grammarians did not fix a prescribed homogeneous linguistic
norm. Instead, we find that they described a large variety of different linguistic
options, which are very often presented as equally valid without any norma-
tive opinion being expressed, far from establishing a rigid linguistic standard to
whichallspeakerswereexpectedtoadhere.It,therefore,canhardlybesaidthat
“from its earliest times to the present, [Classical] Arabic has remained super-
ficially almost unchanged” (Fischer 2002, 1). Instead, the Classical language as
we know it today has become much less diverse than what the early Kufan and
Basran grammarians allowed.
Whenever the grammarians do express a normative preference towards cer-
tain forms, they often take pains to point out that the other options are valid
too, and when such a preference is expressed, this does not mean that the pre-
ferredoptionistheonethatendsupinClassicalArabic.Thisweseeforexample
in the case of having a fourth long vowel ē as the reflex of ancient triphthongs
written with the ʔalif maqṣūrah, which al-Farrāʔ explicitly endorses, whereas

Moreover, the features described by the grammarians often seem to repre-
sent clear, regular phonological developments in the varieties they describe,
giving an impression that we are dealing with natural language that has under-
gone regular sound changes (especially Najdi vowel harmony and syncope,
see §2.2.3, §2.2.4). However, in Classical Arabic as we know it today, the out-
comes of these sound laws that still seemed regular at the time of the early
grammarians have now lexicalized and grammaticalized in mixed forms. This
is something we see for example with the syncopation of the li- before apoco-
pates of command (§2.2.4.4), the use of the Barth-Ginsberg variant only for the
fossilized form ʔixālu ‘methinks’ (§2.2.5), and the lexically determined vowel
harmony and syncope in niʕma and biʔsa (§2.2.4.1).
While there are clear prescriptive parameters within which the ʕarabiyyah
operates, it is clear that what they consider to be the ʕarabiyyah was much
broader than what becomes the Classical standard. It takes centuries before
anykindof homogeneousstandardcomesforwardfromthegrammarianenter-
prise. Suggesting that such a homogeneous grammatical standard was already
recognized in the late 8th/early 9th century or even the pre-Islamic period is
anachronistic. Moreover, as we will see in the next chapter, the linguistic vari-
ation described by the grammarians was not of mere theoretical interest but
was actually liberally employed in the Quranic reading traditions.
The abundance of different options does not help us to achieve a clear
answer as to what the language of the Quran is. Even if we accept the asser-
tion of the Arab grammarians that the Quran it was revealed in the ʕarabiyyah,
that definition is clearly too broad to be meaningful, and we are left with the
question: “which ʕarabiyyah?” In the following chapters I will further explore
this question.

Classical Arabic and the reading traditions

3.1
Introduction
It is often stated that the Quran was composed in Classical Arabic, and that,
moreover, the Quran served as a basis for Classical Arabic. These statements,
taken at face value, seem to neatly wrap up our history of Arabic from the
Islamic period onwards. The Quran introduced Classical Arabic as the main
cultural language, and from that point forward all Islamic writing proceeded
to imitate the linguistic standard set by the Quran. However, these claims have
never been demonstrated, and I hope to show here that this definition is unsat-
isfactory. Already in the previous chapter we saw that the ʕarabiyyah in the
definition of the early grammarians is very broad, allowing for many differ-
ent answers to what the language of the Quran really was. It is only in later
times that what is considered Classical Arabic becomes strongly restricted. In
this chapter, I will show that what was accepted as proper Arabic to recite the
Quran in far exceeded the strict norms of the literary language that came to be
accepted.
When we ask ourselves what the language of the Quran is, we should in
turn ask ourselves “which Quran?” All too often, authors (often implicitly)
assume that the Quranic text, in its full and ubiquitous form as we know it from
the Cairo Edition of 1924, is the language in which it was pronounced by the
prophet Muhammad.This text only represents the transmission of ʔabū ʕumar
Ḥafṣb. Sulayman b. al-Muġīrah al-ʔasadī al-Bazzāz al-Kūfī (d. 180ah/796ce),
colloquially known as Ḥafṣ, one of the transmitters of ʔabū Bakr ʕāṣim b. ʔabī

mission is by far the most dominant reading today, and linguistically his read-
ing is rather close—but not identical—to Classical Arabic as it is described
in our modern textbooks and, by extension, also very close to Modern Stan-
dard Arabic.2 This closeness may very well have given rise to the notion that
the language of the Quran is more-or-less identical to the later norms of the
literary language. But Ḥafṣ’ reading is not the only reading of the Quran avail-
able, nor is it considered in any way more normative than other ones. Even
today, there are millions of Muslims in Morocco and Algeria (and their dias-
pora in Europe) who recite the Quran according to the reading of ʔabū Saʕīd
ʕuṯmān b. Saʕīd al-Maṣrī (d. 197ah/812ce) commonly known by his agnomen
Warš, who was a transmitter of ʔabū Ruwaym Nāfiʕ b. ʕabd al-Raḥmān b. ʔabī
Nuʕaym (d. 169ah/785ce).Warš’s reading not only differs from Ḥafṣin specific
wordchoices,butalsoshowsclearphonologicalandmorphologicaldifferences
with that of Ḥafṣ. To illustrate this, let us look at Q3:13 in both Ḥafṣ’s and Warš’s
reading.3 I have marked every word that is pronounced differently between the
two in bold, and provide an ipa transcription of both readings.

2 It seems to me that this correlation is unlikely to be a coincidence. Ḥafṣwas the dominant
transmission in the late Ottoman empire, and this is the time in which Modern Standard
Arabic also started to be standardized. The historical development of the standard form of
Classical Arabic, when it became standardized, and whether it was Ḥafṣ’s transmission that
influenced the formation of the standard or whether he rose to prominence because of his
closeness to this standard is something that has not yet been adequately studied, and is out-
side the scope of this monograph.

In terms of the specific wording, the two readings are nearly identical.The only
difference is that Ḥafṣreads yarawna-hum miṯlay-him raʔya l-ʕayn “they see
them as being twice their (number) by their own vision” whereas Warš reads
tarawna-hum “you see them as …”.
The morphological and phonetic differences of Warš compared to Ḥafṣ,
however, are much more numerous.
– Warš lengthens the plural pronouns -kum, -hum, ʔantum, hum, -tum with
an extra ū whenever it is directly followed by a word that starts with a ʔ
(lakumū).
– Warš replaces the ʔ with a glide whenever it is the first root consonant and
not word-initial (yuwayyidu).
– Warš and Ḥafṣ(and all other readers) agree that a long vowel ā, ī, ū should
bepronouncedoverlongwheneveraʔ follows.ButWaršalsopronouncesthe
vowel overlong whenever the ʔ precedes these long vowels (ʔāyatun).
– The overlong vowel in Warš’ recitation is pronounced significantly longer
than that of Ḥafṣ(e.g. yašāʔ).
– Warš, as a rule, has a distinction between two vowels that are merged to ā
for Ḥafṣ. Whenever this vowel is written with a yāʔ—pointing to its etymo-
logical origin—it is pronounced as ǟ (ʔuxrǟ).
– The sequence ra is pronounced emphatically by Ḥafṣand the other canon-
ical readers, with the exception of Warš who reads it without emphasis if i
stands in the previous syllable and no emphatic consonants intervene.

chapter 3
– The sequence āri is raised to ǟri if the -i is the genitive case vowel (l-abṣǟri)
by Warš.
– For Warš, if a word that starts with a glottal stop is preceded by a word that
ends in a consonant, or the definite article, the glottal stop is dropped. Pre-
ceding long vowels are still shortened before the definite article, as if it were
a two-consonant cluster (l-abṣǟri).
– A final effect inWarš’s reading not found if one pauses on yašāʔ (an optional
pause) but present if one does not is the dropping of the second ʔ whenever
two of those meet with one short vowel in between across word boundaries.
Thus yašāʔu ʔinna would be pronounced yašāʔu inna [jaʃaːːːʔu.inːa].
This overview gives a taste of some of the pervasive linguistic effects of the dif-
ferent readings. They can have variations in their phonological vowel systems,
their phonetic realization, morphology and indeed specific wording.While dif-
ferences in the specific wording are significantly less common than those con-
cerning the linguistic details, these still concern thousands of words. As for the
linguistic details, the vast majority of the verses are affected in some way by
changes in sound and form of the Quranic readings.
Today, ten readings are accepted as canonical (Nasser 2013a; Nöldeke et al.
2013, 529ff.). The first seven of these were canonized by the end of the 3rd or
beginning of the 4th century ah when Ibn Muǧāhid (d. 324ah/936ce) wrote
his Kitāb al-Sabʕah fī al-Qirāʾāt. This is the earliest extant book on the readings
and probably the first to make a real effort to restrain the number of read-
ings that existed in this period.4 However, for these seven readers, Ibn Muǧāhid
reports no less than 49 immediate transmitters. Today, only two transmission
paths for each of the canonical readers are considered canonical (thus mak-
ing it 14 transmissions in total; not all these paths are immediate transmit-
ters). This “two-Rāwī Canon” seems to have been first introduced by ʔabū al-
Ṭayyibb.Ġalbūn(d.389ah/998ce),butreallytookoff whenʔabūʕamral-Dānī
(d. 444ah/1052–1053ce) wrote his Al-Taysīr fī al-Qirāʔāt al-Sabʕ, and Al-Šāṭibī
(d. 590ah/1194ah) summarized it into a didactic poem popularly known as
al-Šāṭibiyyah. These two works are still dominant in the teaching of the seven
readings today (Nasser 2013a).
The seven readers are associated with five important districts, one each for
Medina, Mecca, Damascus and Basra and three for Kufa.The seven readers and
their transmitters are as follows (after Watt and Bell 1991, 49):
4 There were almost certainly several works on the readings before ibn Muǧāhid, such as ʔabū
ʕubayd’s and al-Ṭabarī’s, but these appear to have been lost (Nasser 2013b, 36ff.).

Some of these transmitters differ more from each other than others. The dif-
ferences between Ḥafṣand Šuʕbah, for example, are so numerous that they
disagree with one another more often than two separate readers like Ḥamzah
and al-Kisāʔī. While all other transmitters have differences as well, these trans-
mitters agree with each other much more often, at least when it comes to the
choice of specific words.
While Ibn Muǧāhid tends to be seen as the ‘canonizer’ of the seven readers,
his canonization only cemented the seven as taking up a central position in
the canon, but did not necessarily prevent other readings from being added to
the canon. Shortly after him, many works were written that added more and
more readers to these initial seven. While many of these other readings have
not reached general acceptance in the Muslim community, three more readers
have eventually been accepted into the canon. The definitive canonization of
the three after the seven is attributed to Ibn al-Ǧazarī (d. 751ah/1350ce) who
adds the Basran Yaʕqūb al-Ḥaḍramī, Medinan ʔabū Ǧaʕfar and the Kufan Xalaf

chapter 3
In the Našr Ibn al-Ǧazarī also records in detail a second path of the trans-
mission of Warš, namely that of al-ʔaṣbahānī, which has significant differences
with the one recorded already by al-Dānī, the path of al-ʔazraq.
When we see statements that claim that “the Koran established an unchang-
ing norm for the Arabic language” (Thackston 1994, xii) or “the Koran […] was
none other than the poetic koinē” (Rabin 1955, 24), this is not very informative.
When we actually want to examine what this alleged unchanging norm looked
like, we are confronted not with a single answer, but instead with more than
twenty different ones. All of these readings differ in significant linguistic ways
from what is now considered the standard and, moreover, contain linguistic
features that not infrequently fall outside of the purview of the kind of linguis-
tic variation that is described by the Arab grammarians.
In this chapter I will examine what the Quranic readings are, and what they
are not. First, I will show that the readings cannot be considered dialects of
Arabic or simply Classical Arabic with some dialectal specificities added onto
them. Moreover, I will show that there is a high amount of purposeful artifi-
ciality to the linguistic practices present in the readings showing what must
be considered a concerted effort to make the readings unusual, exotic and elo-
quent.Asaresult,Iconcludethatintermsof whatthereadingscantellusabout
the language of the Quran, they fail to give a consistent and uniform answer. As
such, the readings cannot serve as the sole source to inform us about the lan-
guage of the Quran.
3.2
Reading or Recitation?
The term qirāʔah, the Arabic name used for a reading tradition, is ambiguous,
as it can mean both “recitation” or “reading”.The first meaning might imply the
readings(asItranslateqirāʔāt here)areapurelyoraltransmissionof theQuran.
Muslims today often envision the readings in such a way, seeing the canonical
readings as unbroken and mass-transmitted (mutawātir) of the Quranic text
from the prophet until today.5 In the early 20th century, Gotthelf Bergsträßer
(Nöldeke et al. 2013, 472ff.) already saw that this strict way of envisioning the
readings as purely oral “recitations” is untenable, which led him to conclude
that the Quranic consonantal text was in many cases primary to the readings
5 The view that the transmission of the Quran is tawātur seems to develop some significant
time after the canonization of the readers. For an in-depth discussion on the emergence of
view of tawātur of the readings see Nasser (2013b).

that exist. I follow him in this conclusion, but it is worth examining in detail
some of the arguments in favour of seeing the readings being dependent on
the written form of the text.
First of all, each and every canonical reading basically agrees with the Uth-
manic rasm, something that is even deemed necessary for a reading to be con-
sidered valid (at least as early as al-Ṭabarī (d. 310/923), see Nasser 2013b, 45).
Companion readings such as those reported for ʔubayy and Ibn Masʕūd are
considered invalid recitations in part because they do not agree with the rasm.
If even well-respected companions of the prophet had readings that allowed
for more oral variation than the Uthmanic readings, it is highly unlikely that
so many different oral traditions just so happened to agree with the rasm. For
example, Ḥamzah ultimately traces his reading back to the famous companion
Ibn Masʕūd (al-Dānī Taysīr, 9). Ibn Masʕūd’s reading does not agree with the
rasmwhileḤamzah’sreadingdoes.Themostlikelyexplanationforthisdiscrep-
ancy is that Ḥamzah purposely changed his reading in order for it to agree with
the rasm, rather than Ibn Masʕūd having used two readings, one not agreeing
with the rasm, and another one that just so happened to agree with the (not
yet extant) rasm.6
Occasionally it is possible to envision those variant readings indeed have
origins in a pre-existent oral tradition where the rasm, by accident, accom-
modated both readings. For example, in Q33:68 ʕāṣim is the only one to read
wa-ʔalʕan-humlaʕnankabīran “and curse them with great cursing”, rather than
wa-ʔalʕan-hum laʕnan kaṯīran “and curse them with many a curse.” (Ibn al-
Ǧazarī, §3952). The difference between these two readings comes down to a
difference in dotting in the wordكٮٮراwhich could either be read kaṯīran or
kabīran, but these two readings are semantically and phonetically so close,
that it does not seem unlikely that such variants could have existed in the oral
transmission of the Quranic text before canonization, and by sheer accident
happenedtoagreewiththerasmwhenitwasinstated.However,thereareother
6 See also the highly interestingwork of Shahpasand &Vahidnia (2018) who show that Ḥamzah
and al-Kisāʔī overwhelmingly choose for reading verbs as masculine when the rasm allows
both a masculine or feminine reading, which they convincingly argue is based on the fact
that Ibn Masʕūd’s told his students to do so, saying: ʔiḏā xtalaftum fī qirāʔati yāʔin wa-tāʔin,
fa-qraʔū ʕalā yāʔin, wa-ḏakkirū l-qurʔān, fa-ʔinnahū muḏakkar “when you disagree on the
reading of a yāʔ or a tāʔ [of a prefix-conjugation verb] then read it with a yāʔ, and make the
Quran masculine, for it is masculine.” In a highly engaging paper presented at the Reading the
Rasm ii symposium (3–5 December 2019, Berlin), Shahpasand further showed that especially
Ḥamzah consistently chooses readings that agree with Ibn Masʕūd’s reading as much as the
rasm could allow, even occasionally reading the consonantal skeleton in rather unintuitive
ways in order to accommodate such readings.

variants where the phonetics are rather different, and it is by coincidence that
in the ambiguous script of Arabic they happen to be written the same. It is
unlikely that these kinds of variants do not have their basis in the Uthmanic
rasm. Some salient examples of this point are the following:ڡٮٮٮٮواfa-taṯabbatū
‘proceed with caution!’ (al-Kisāʔī; Ḥamzah; Xalaf), fa-tabayyanū ‘be clear!’ (the
others) (Q4:94; Q49:6, Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2951);ىڡص الحٯyaquṣṣu l-ḥaqq ‘he tells
the truth’ (Nafīʕ, ʔabū Ğaʕfar Ibn Kaṯīr, ʕāṣim), yaqḍi l-ḥaqq ‘he decides the
truth’(theothers)(Q6:57;Ibnal-Ǧazarī,§3029);7ٮٮلواtatlū‘recites,recounts’(al-
Kisāʔī; Ḥamzah; Xalaf) tablū ‘tests’ (the others) (Q10:30; ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3354).
In such cases, the most likely explanation as to why the readers disagree is not
that they were transmitting an oral transmission, but rather that the readers
were confronted with an ambiguous rasm and interpreted it in two ways that
both made semantic sense.8
A final point that shows that the readers are to a significant extent depen-
dent on the written form of the text, can be gathered from the fact that the
canonical readers all agree with the rasm of their respective regions. The tradi-
tion has it that when Uthman standardized and distributed the text, he had (at
least)fourcopiesof thetextmade,anddistributedthesetoMedina,Basra,Kufa
and Syria (most likely Homs, not Damascus9). This traditional account is cor-
roborated by Quranic manuscripts, as it is clear that all Quranic manuscripts
of the Uthmanic Text Type descend from a single archetype (van Putten 2019c)
and we can indeed identify which of these four regional traditions a Quranic
manuscript belongs to by comparing the differences in the rasm they have
(Sidky 2021).
There are about 60 locations in the Quran, where these regional codices
have a slightly different consonantal skeleton. The way that these variants are
distributed form a perfect, uncontaminated, stemma (Cook 2004). When such
regional difference in consonantal skeleton appears, it is consistently followed
closely by the readers of these different regions.10 For example, the Syrian

There are a small number of exceptions to this general rule. Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim deviates from
the Kufan Codex in Q36:35 reading ʕamilat-hu, instead of ʕamilat (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4006)
and Q43:71 taštahī-hi instead of taštahī (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4169). ʔabū Ǧaʕfar in one case
deviates from the Medinan rasm favouring the Syrian variant Q10:22 yanšuru-kum over
yusayyiru-kum (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3251). ʔabū ʕamr reads Q40:26 wa-ʔin instead of ʔaw ʔin
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4101).

codex exclusively has Q7:141اٮحٮكمwhereas the other codices haveاٮحٮٮكم
.This is
reflected in the readings where the Syrian reader Ibn ʕāmir reads ʔanǧā-kum,
whereas all other readers read ʔanǧaynā-kum (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §3137). Likewise,
the Medinan and Syrian codices have Q5:54ٮرٮددwhere the Basran and Kufan

Ǧaʕfar read this word as yartadid where the other readers read yartadda (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī §2989).
The agreement of the readings with the rasm cannot be explained by an
intentional accommodation of the rasm to already existing local oral tradi-
tions. Had this been the case, we would be unable to explain how the Syrian
muṣḥaf shares all variants with the Medinan codex and not a single one with
the Basran and Kufan codex, etc. So, whatever oral tradition existed was evi-
dently subjected to a requirement to agree with the rasm rather than the rasm

think of the Quranic reading traditions as being just that, primarily readings of

3.3
Lack of Regular Sound Change
Many differences among the readings come down to different interpretations
of the meaning of the text, reading words differently which here and there can
have significant impact on the meaning of a verse and the theology that flows
from it. However, most of the differences do not come down to textual/inter-
pretational differences, but rather involve linguistic differences. For example,
whilemostreadersreadʕalay-him‘uponthem’,ḤamzahandYaʕqūbreadʕalay-
hum and Ibn Kaṯīr, ʔabū Ǧaʕfar and optionally Qālūn read it ʕalay-himū. These
differences do not affect the meaning in any way, yet they are linguistically
salient. These kinds of purely linguistic differences are what gives these read-
ings their distinct flavour, and are the features that helps one most easily dis-
tinguish the different readings from one another.
As we saw already in the previous chapter, the Arab grammatical tradition
records a vast amount of linguistic variation within the ʕarabiyyah. This varia-
tion is often presented through clear and regular rules by these grammarians.
Such reports seem to reflect actual sound changes that have taken place in the
dialects of the ʕarabiyyah, and the agreement of the descriptions between the
different early grammarians seems to lend considerable confidence to at least
the general dialect geography they sketch. The most comprehensive account
of the grammarian reports of the linguistic variation of the ʕarabiyyah is still
the monumental work by Rabin (1951), which will serve to some extent as a

chapter 3
basis for the following examination. However, because it is almost 70 years
old now, there is some room for this work to be updated. Most importantly,
an edition of one of the earliest accounts of the Arabic dialects has recently
been published. At the time of Rabin’s writing, this work was known to have
existed, but no manuscript was known to have been preserved. This work is al-
Farrāʔ’s (d. 207/822) Kitāb fīh Luġāt al-Qurʔān. As a student of al-Kisāʔī—the
Quranic reader, grammarian and famous rival of Sībawayh11—al-Farrāʔ con-
stitutes the earliest example of the Kufan school of grammar of which there
are extant works available. It is now clear that an enormous amount of the
dialectal data recorded by later grammarians is highly dependent on al-Farrāʔ’s
work. This is often confirmed explicitly by later grammarians who cite either
al-Farrāʔ or al-Kisāʔī (often on al-Farrāʔ’s authority) for many of the data they
adduce.
In the following sections, we will examine some of the linguistic features
reported for the ʕarabiyyah, and we will focus primarily on the accounts of
al-Farrāʔ and Sībawayh. While later grammarians may occasionally adduce
features of the Arabic dialects not mentioned by either of these authors, the
amount of such data that is relevant to the Quran seems rather more limited.
Moreover, as we are interested in the Arabic of the time the Quran was com-
posed, it seems worthwhile to stick to the secondary sources that are as close
to this period as possible.
Rabin’s (1951, 7) claim that “the grammarians of the Basrian school evinced
little real interest in the dialects” and that “Sībawayh mentions mainly usages
as were permissible in Arabic as he conceived it.” gives perhaps too little credit
to the monumental importance of Sībawayh’s work on Arabic. It is true that al-
Kitāb has far fewer attributions of features of Arabic to different tribes than
Luġāt al-Qurʔān, but this seems to a large extent dependent on genre. The
express goal of al-Farrāʔ’s work was to record and classify all the different lin-
guistic practices as they occur in the Quran, whereas Sībawayh’s is much more
concerned with a description and explanation of the grammatical workings.
Much of the variation described by al-Farrāʔ is likewise described by Sībawayh,
but often lacking the explicit tribal attribution.
The profound influence that al-Farrāʔ’s work had on later grammarians and
lexicographers in forming the classificatory framework in which variation of
Arabic is understood may have led to the impression that that was the focus of
the Kufans par excellence. As we will see, Sībawayh’s work often does comment
11
He famously bested Sībawayh in a debate known as al-Masʔalah al-Zunbūriyyah, which is
said to have led to Sībawayh’s untimely demise (Carter 2004, 13f.).

on dialectal uses, and when he does it more often than not coincides with the
description of al-Farrāʔ, although the latter is generally more detailed.
As more or less contemporaneous grammarians of two different schools,12
finding the observations of the one grammarian corroborated by the other
should help alleviate some of the unease a modern linguist might feel about
the reliability of such accounts. While the Arab grammarians were certainly
not interested in everyday speech, which must have already have developed
significantly towards a form closer to the modern dialects as we know them
today (see §2.4), whatever these rival grammarians are describing and agree-
ing upon must have represented some linguistic reality.
Nevertheless, the following sections will not depend on the assumption that
the Arab grammarians are necessarily reporting reliable data of the dialects:
these sections will examine certain linguistic processes in their own right,
regardless of what tribe they are attributed to. When phonetic sound changes
take place in a natural language, these operate without exception. Thus, for
example, English underwent a development where word-initial /kn-/ lost the
/k/, and therefore all modern English words that are still written, through
historical orthography with this cluster, all pronounce it simply with /n-/,
e.g. knight, knee, knot, knead. Dutch, having not undergone this development
retains and pronounces the k in all of these places, as in knecht, knie, knot and
kneden. It would be highly unexpected to find that some English words pre-
served the /kn-/ pronunciation, or that only some Dutch words lost the /k-/.
Regularity of sound change, also called “sound laws” is one of the fundamental
principles of historical linguistics, and when such regularity fails to apply, and
there is no obvious explanation for this, this is a strong indication that we are
dealing with a significantly mixed literary register (Hock 1991, 34–51).
In the following sections, we will examine a number of sound changes that
are described by the Arab grammarians as clear and regular sound laws that
apply in some of the dialects. As we will see, in the Quranic reading traditions
these fail to apply in a consistent way. Regardless of whether the attribution
of such developments to different tribes by the grammarians is accurate, the
failure of these developments to apply regularly is enough to show that the
Quranic reading traditions do not make up consistent linguistic systems.
3.3.1
Harmony of the Pronominal Suffixes
According to al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 10f.), Qurayš and the people of the Hijaz had
unharmonized ʕalay-hum, ʕalay-humā, ʕalay-hunna and ʕalay-hu/ū. The peo-
12
Al-Farrāʔ was born in 144/761 (Blachère ei2 al-Farrāʾ), whereas Sībawayh was presumably
born around 135/752 (Carter 2004, 10).

ple of Najd (i.e. ʔasad, Qays and Tamīm) harmonized -hum, -humā, -hunna and
-hu/ū after i, ī or ay, e.g. ʕalay-him, ʕalay-himā, ʕalay-hinna, ʕalay-hi. Sībawayh
(iv, 195–198) likewise attributes the unharmonized forms to the Hijaz, and does
not specify where the harmonized forms are used.
The majority of the readers read in the Najdi manner in terms of vowel har-
mony. This is the case for ʕāṣim, ibn ʕāmir, ʔabū ʕamr, and even for the Hijazis
ibn Kaṯīr, ʔabū Ǧaʕfar, and Nāfiʕ. Clearly, the Quranic preferences do not cor-
respond to the dialectal geography of the readers. There are two reciters who
on occasion use the Hijazi form of the plural pronoun. For Ḥamzah this is lexi-
cally determined, he only recites ʔilay-hum, laday-hum and ʕalay-hum without
vowel harmony. Other cases of -ay- + 3pl.m. suffix undergo vowel harmony, e.g.
ǧannatay-him(Q34:16)andotherpronounsdotoo,e.g.ʕalay-himā(e.g.Q2:229).
As for Yaʕqūb, he blocks vowel harmony of all the plural and dual pronouns
(-hum,humā,hunnabutnotthesingularpronoun-hū/u)whenī orayprecedes,
but not when -i precedes. While both of our early grammarians describe vowel
harmony,neitherof themseemstobeawareof varietiesthatmakeadistinction
in harmonization between ī and ay as against i (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1120). This kind
of lexically or phonetically conditioned harmony is not described by the Arab
grammarians and seems to be an innovation specific to the Quranic reading
register (van Putten and Sidky forthcoming).
Whileneithergrammarianassignsadialectalidentificationtolengthdishar-
mony and long plural pronouns, it is worth mentioning for completeness’ sake
the treatment of this among the readers as well. Ibn Kaṯīr lacks vowel-length
disharmony of the singular pronoun, and always has long pronouns, e.g. fīhī
(Q2:1) and xuḏūhū fa-ʕtulū-hū (Q44:47), all other readers do have this vowel
length disharmony (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1212). All readers (except Ibn Kaṯīr) also
agreewithal-Farrāʔ’spreferencetopronouncethepronounasshortafteracon-
sonant such as minhu, rather than Sībawayh’s preference of minhū (see §2.2.1).
Both Ibn Kaṯīr and ʔabū Ǧaʕfar always use the long forms of the plural pro-
nouns,humū,ʕalayhimū,ʔantumū,etc.,whereasQālūnʕanNāfiʕhastheoption
to read with long or short pronouns (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1122). Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ also
makes use of the long pronouns but the conditioning will be discussed in more
detail later in this chapter (§3.6.5). Thus, long pronouns seem to have been
a typical feature of Hijazi recitation, but this does not align with the dialect
geography as described by the Arab grammarians, who do not associate long
pronouns with the Hijaz at all, and instead suggest it may be used in any dialect
freely (§2.2.1).

3.3.2
Najdi Syncope
One of the well-known features of the Najdi dialects compared to the dialects
of the Hijaz, is their conditioned dropping of short high vowels (e.g. Rabin
1951, 97f.). In section §2.2.4 we have discussed the treatment of this syncope
as it is described by the Grammarians. From this description it becomes clear
thatbothSībawayhandal-Farrāʔdescribearegularlinguisticdevelopmentthat
spans a variety of different environments. While several readers have the syn-
cope in some cases, they fail to apply regularly in all phonetically comparable
environments. Even when it concerns a single class (such as nouns of the shape
CuCuC syncopating to CuCC), not a single reader treats these in a similar man-
ner.
The following sections will look at six different environments in which this
syncope is expected to take place when we follow the descriptions of the Arab
grammarians. These will be discussed as separate categories as their treatment
is different between the reading traditions.
3.3.2.1
Syncope in fa-huwa, wa-hiya Etc.
According to al-Farrāʔ and Sībawayh (see §2.2.4.3), the third person singular
pronouns huwa and hiya undergo syncopation of the u/i whenever wa-, fa-
or la- would precede among the people of Najd, yielding wa-hwa, fa-hwa, la-
hwa, wa-hya, fa-hya, la-hya, whereas language the people of the Hijaz did not
undergo this development, retaining fa-huwa, fa-hiya etc. (al-Farrāʔ Luġāt,
29).
Al-Farrāʔ adds that the Quranic reciters can use either the syncopated or
the full form. This is in line with what we find. Qālūn ʕan Nāfiʕ, ʔabū ʕamr, al-
Kisāʔī and ʔabū Ǧaʕfar apply this syncope to the pronouns, while the rest opts
for the Hijazi form (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2641).13 Note that in terms of geograph-
ical distribution, no pattern appears, the Medinese readers, a single Basran
and a single Kufan follow the Najdi pattern, while the others follow the Hijazi
one.
3.3.2.2
Fa/wa-li-yafʕal > fa/wa-l-yafʕal
Sibawayh (iv, 151f.) and al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 29) mention that the li- of command
may either syncopate or be maintained when wa- or fa- precedes, thus the
Najdi manner is wa/fa-l-yafʕal while the Hijazi manner is wa/fa-li-yafʕal (see
also §2.2.4.4). Sībawayh explicitly mentions that those who say wa/fa-l-yafʕal
also reduce the vowel in wa-hwa, and wa-hya reduced it.
13
Al-Kisāʔī also reads ṯumma hwa (Q28:61) and ʔabū Ǧaʕfar yumilla hwa (Q2:282).

chapter 3
This view had clearly shifted by the time of Ibn Muǧāhid (454), who dis-
cusses the reading wa-li-yaḍribna (Q24:31) ‘let them (f.) draw’ attributed to a
non-canonical transmitter of ʔabū ʕamr, ʕabbās b. Faḍl. Ibn Muǧāhid com-
ments that this reading is as if it had the meaning of “in order to” (understand-
ing it as wa-li- + subjunctive rather than wa-l(i)- + apocopate), which semanti-
cally does not make sense in this context.Thus, Ibn Muǧāhid concludes “I don’t
know what this is” (wa-lā ʔadrī mā hāḏā). From this it is clear that that to Ibn
Muǧāhid the li- in such a context needs to be syncopated for it to designate the
li- of command, and indeed all canonical readings have undergone this syn-
cope, even those that do not syncopate wa-huwa and wa-hiya. The relation as
drawn by the grammarians is therefore not applied regularly in the canonical
readings.
The unsyncopated form, however, is still well-attested in non-canonical
readings, both as they are reported in the literary tradition (see, for example
Ibn Xālawayh muxtaṣar, 12, 17f., 18), as well as how they occur in early vocal-
ized Quranic manuscripts. In BnF Arabe 330f, 34r (Q4:102), for example, we
find clear evidence for fa-li-taqum, wa-li-yaʔxuḏū, fa-li-yakūnū, wa-li-taʔti, fa-
li-yuṣallū and wa-li-yaʔxuḏū. It is therefore clear that we are not so much deal-
ing with a fixed literary standard that preferred this syncopation, but instead
this consensus developing in the time between the early Islamic period and the
time that Ibn Muǧāhid canonizes the seven readings.
3.3.2.3
CuCuC > CuCC
The people of the Hijaz pronounced singular and plural nouns of the shape
CuCuC, along with other stems with this shape, with both vowels, whereas the
Tamīmdroppedthesecondvowelinallof thesecases.Thereadersusuallyagree
on the archaic Hijazi pattern, but occasionally a lexical item has the Tamīm
form.
While al-Farrāʔ does not comment on every single CuCuC noun present
in the Quran, he mentions a fair number of them explicitly as being a Hijazi
practice. Of the nouns mentioned by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt) that show disagreement
among the readers we have huzuʔan, kufuʔan (pg. 26) qudus (pg. 44), qurubah
(pg. 72) ǧuruf (pg. 72), ʔukul (pg. 86), nukur (pg. 87). If we examine how the
different readers treat these nouns, we find that not a single reader consis-
tently opts for the Hijazi (H) or Tamimi (T) form, although ʔabū Ǧaʕfar comes
fairly close to a regular treatment of the form as Hijazi (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2669–
2694):

chapter 3
Besides these words there are three more words that have undergone a syn-
cope in ʔabū ʕamr’s reading when heavy syllable suffixes (-hā, -nā, -hum, -kum)
follow: ʔukul ‘food’, rusul ‘messengers’ and subul ‘paths’, yielding forms such as
ruslu-hum, subla-nā, and ʔukla-hā (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2676, 2678, 2683). For the
nouns of the shape CuCuC in his reading, the syncope conditioned by heavy
syllable suffixes is almost regular. Only nuzulu-hum is normally not included in
this syncope (although there are non-canonical transmissions that include it,
see Ibn Muǧāhid, 623).
From the words disagreed upon no clear pattern emerges. Most readers
apply the Tamīmī syncope with some frequency (with the exception of ʔabū
Ǧaʕfar), with some of the eastern readers being less prolific than some Hijazi
readers in applying it and vice versa. However, many of the remaining words—
quite a few of which are explicitly mentioned by al-Farrāʔ as undergoing this
development in Tamīmī—unanimously have the Hijazi form among all the
readers, e.g. kutub ‘books’ (pg. 31),18 nusuk ‘sacrifice’ (pg. 33), nuzul ‘hospital-
ity’ (pg. 53), sudus ‘⅙’ (pg. 54), ṯuluṯ‘⅓’ (pg. 54), qubul ‘front’ (pg. 77), dubur
‘back’ (pg. 77), ʕunuq ‘neck’ (pg. 80), ǧuruz ‘barren’ (pg. 85), ʕumur ‘life’ (pg.
99). Besides this there are words in the Quran that have the right word shape
to undergo syncope but are not explicitly mentioned by al-Farrāʔ, these too
are consistently unsyncopated, e.g. zubur ‘psalms’, rubuʕ ‘¼’, ṯumun ‘⅛’, ǧunub
‘a distance’, ḥurum ‘in consecrated state’, nuṣub ‘idol’, ẓufur ‘nail’, xumus ‘⅕’,
furuṭ‘something excessive’, ḥuqub ‘long period of time’, ṣuḥuf ‘leaves’, xumur
‘veils’, ḥulum ‘dream; (+ balaġa ‘attain puberty’)’, xuluq ‘disposition, nature’,
suquf ‘roofs’, ḥubuk ‘celestial paths, orbits’, dusur ‘nails’, and suʕur ‘insanity’.
Every single reading therefore overwhelmingly adheres to the Hijazi forms, but
the reasons why readers occasionally switch to the Tamimi form are unclear
and unpredictable and cannot be obviously understood as an intrusion of the
local dialect of the readers into their otherwise overall Hijazi reading.
3.3.2.4
CuCuCāt Plurals of CuCCah Nouns
Syncopealsohappensinthepluralformationof shortvowelsof CuCCahnouns.
According to al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 16), the people of the Hijaz and the ʔasad form
their plurals of ẓulmah, ḥuǧrah, ġurfah and xuṭwah with the infixation of u
before the last root consonant, before adding the regular feminine plural -āt,
Ibn Muǧāhid (534) transmits a single case of Tamīmī syncope of this noun in Q35:11
through two non-canonical transmitters of ʔabū ʕamr.
18
Vocalized Quranic manuscripts show that syncopated plurals may have been more com-
mon, e.g. ar-rusla (Q38:14) is found inWolfen. Cod. Guelf. 12.11 Aug. 2°, 5v, l. 4.; Arabe 334d,
58r, l. 6; Arabe 347b, 81v, l. 2.

i.e. ẓulumāt, ḥuǧurāt, ġurufāt, xuṭuwāt (also ḥurumāt, qurubāt). The Tamīm
and some of the Qays are said to have not had this infixed vowel, i.e. ẓulmāt,
ḥuǧrāt, ġurfāt, xuṭwāt.
In the Hijazi/ʔasad Arabic reported by al-Farrāʔ the infixed vowel is always
u, but historically this probably derived from an infixed *a (see Suchard and
Groen 2021). Traces of forms with the original a-infix are attested in the read-
ing of the Medinan ʔabū Ǧaʕfar who reads al-ḥuǧarāt (Q49:4) rather than
al-ḥuǧurāt as it is read by the other readers (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4247). Al-Farrāʔ
(Luġāt, 132) explicitly mentions ʔabū Ǧaʕfar’s reading as an option besides
ḥuǧurāt and ḥuǧrāt (Luġāt, 16). Despite ʔabū Ǧaʕfar’s archaic retention of the
unharmonized plural CuCaCāt in this case, all the other plurals of this type just
follow the reported Hijazi/ʔasad form.
Al-xuṭuwāt (Q2:168 etc.) is read in the Tamimi/Qaysi manner al-xuṭwāt by
the Nāfiʕ, al-Bazzī ʕan Ibn Kaṯīr, ʔabū ʕamr and Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim, Ḥamzah and
Xalaf. The other readers have the Hijazi/Asadi form (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2673). In
all other cases the readers are in agreement in following the Hijazi/ʔasad form.
Here once again we see that the syncope is not applied regularly.
3.3.2.5
Faʕi/ul(ah) Nouns
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 29) explicitly states that the people of Najd, who syncopated
huwa and hiya after wa-, fa- and la-, also syncopate harim > harm raǧul > raǧl.
Later, al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 39) reports that the Tamīm and Bakr b. Wāʔil syncopate
the vowel of original faʕil and faʕilah nouns, while the Hijaz and ʔasad retain
the original vowel. Thus, one gets kalmah instead of kalimah in the east. He
also reports that ‘others’ say kilmah, with vowel harmony of the first vowel to
the syncopated following vowel.
Mostwordsof theshapeCaCiCareunanimouslyreadintheHijaziwaywith-
out syncope. Thus ʕaqib, malik, kalim, laʕib, xaḍir, nakid (when not read as
nakad), ṣaʕiq, fariḥ, ʕarim and ʕaṣir. There are two exceptions, where some
of the readers stick to the Tamimi form. The first of these is raǧili-ka (Q17:64)
which is read as raǧli-ka by everyone but Ḥafṣ(Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3471). Consid-
ering the striking consensus (with the exception of Ḥafṣ), one may wonder
whether we are not simply dealing with different lexical items, where most
readers understood this word as a verbal noun raǧl ‘going by foot’, and Ḥafṣ
understood it as an adjective. The other case is bi-wariqi-kum (Q18:19), explic-
itly discussed by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 85), which is read as bi-warqi-kum by ʔabū
ʕamr, Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim, Ḥamzah, Rawḥʕan Yaʕqūb and Xalaf (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§3492).

full vocalization of kalimah ‘word’,19 naẓirah ‘postponement’, naxirah ‘decayed’
(when not read as nāxirah, Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4508), waǧilah ‘afraid’.This syncope
only occurs once in the plural form, namely naḥisāt ‘unlucky’, which is read by
Ibn Kaṯīr, Nāfiʕ, ʔabū ʕamr and Yaʕqūb as naḥsāt (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4120).
As with faʕil(ah), nouns with the original shape faʕul(ah) are also recorded
with syncope of the second stem vowel for the eastern dialects. These contain
much fewer lexical items, and there is consensus on the Hijazi form among
the canonical readers. The lexical items present in the Quran are ṣaduqah and
maṯulah (Tamīm: ṣudqah, muṯlah, al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 54), ʕaḍud (in the Hijaz also
ʕaḍid, Tamīm: ʕaḍd, Rabīʕah ʕuḍd, al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 85). The fourth of these
nouns is raǧul. While al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 36) explicitly assigns the form raǧul to
the Hijaz, the Tamīmī form is not mentioned specifically, and he simply men-
tions alternative singular formations such as rāǧil and raǧil. Sībawayh (iv, 113)
explicitly assigns the expected form raǧl to Bakr b. Wāʔil and many people of
the Banū Tamīm.
3.3.2.6
CaCi/uCa Verbs
As we have seen so far, some reading traditions irregularly undergo the Najdi
syncope of nouns in only some lexical items. The grammarians also report the
syncope of i and u in open syllables for verbs of the shape CaCiCa and CaCuCa.
Sībawayh explicitly cites ʕalima > ʕalma, ʕilma and šahida > šihda.
Amongthecanonicalreaders,thereisconsensusontheHijaziformsof these
verbs, except for two lexical items, namely, niʕma ‘how good an X’ and biʔsa
‘how bad an X’, both of which are transparently from the verbs *naʕima and
*baʔisa respectively.20 For these there is complete consensus on the Tamīm
forms. A trace of the original Hijazi form of the verb can be found in the read-
ing ofنعماwhich is read as naʕim-mā by Ibn ʕāmir, al-Kisāʔī, Ḥamzah and Xalaf
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2806). Indeed, al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 41) reports that naʕim-mā is
the practice of the people of the Hijaz. The other readers are either niʕim-mā,
niʕ(ĭ)m-māorniʕmmā(allultimately<*naʕimamā).Al-Farrāʔattributesniʕim-
mā to Qays and Tamīm, whereas Sībawayh (iv, 439f.) says “some of them say in

20
Traces of the verbal origins can still be gleaned from the fact that these verbs can agree in
genderwiththeirsubject(althoughthisisoptional)inClassicalArabic,e.g.niʕma/niʕmati
l-marʔatu ‘what a perfect woman!’ (Fischer 2002, §259.1).

this as the dialect of Huḏayl who also say liʕibun rather than laʕibun. Here is a
clear admission that to Sībawayh readings that used both these forms were lin-
guistically mixed.
In all other positions, the canonical readers all read niʕma and biʔsa in their
Tamīmī forms. This distribution is surprising, but seems to reflect a trend that
continuesinClassicalArabicwherewordsof ‘emphaticqualification’(alltrans-
parently originally stative verbs) generally have both unsyncopated and syn-
copated forms.21 Fischer (2002, §259–263), in his discussion of these verbs,
for example cites ḥasuna, ḥusna, ḥasna ‘how beautiful, magnificent’, ʕaẓuma,
ʕuẓma, ʕaẓma ‘how powerful, mighty’, saruʕa, sarʕa, surʕa ‘how swift!’22 What
the exact motivations are for preferring (or at least allowing) theTamīmī forms
in these constructions, whereas otherwise it is strictly avoided in the Quranic
readings and the later Classical Arabic norm is difficult to reconstruct. But it
seems likely that the grammarians felt they had a license to use these forms,
because they were no longer felt to be verbs.
Sībawayh (iv, 115) goes further in his description, showing that any sequence
of CaCiC is said to have been syncopated.Thus, he also reports that muntafixan
would become muntafxan for example, and the imperative inṭaliq would be-
come inṭalq(a). This is absent in the reading traditions, which consistently opt
for the unsyncopated forms typical of the Hijaz.
3.3.2.7
Conclusion
While the syncopation of i, u when such words follow a short syllable seems
to be a regular process in the Najdi Arabic, the application of the rule is highly
erratic in all of the canonical readers.This is not at all something that we would
expect if the reading traditions were the outcome of natural language change.
Likewise, we do not find that the region where different readers were active is
a particularly good predictor of whether they will undergo syncope. The table
summarizes the treatment of the six syncope categories discussed among the
readers, where N stands for Najdi, H for Hijazi. For some of these the distribu-
tion is not absolute. In such N is given followed by the number of words that are
21
Nöldeke, however, astutely points out that especially in early prose it is difficult to know
whether people would have pronounced these as the syncopated biʔsa and niʕma rather
than baʔisa and naʕima. In poetry the norm seems to be the syncopated for, but Nöldeke
cites a verse of Ṭarafah where metrically it is certainly trisyllabic (Nöldeke 1910, 217).
22
Besides these, there are some verbs that cannot show such syncopated forms such as sāʔa
‘how evil’ and ṭāla ‘how often’, or are the result of syncope of geminated roots, a syncope
that is attested in all forms of Arabic, e.g. ʕazza, hadda ‘how mighty’, ǧalla ‘how great!’
šadda ‘how much’, qalla ‘how rare’.

3.3.3
Additional Phonemic Long Vowels
Several of the Quranic readings have more than three phonemic long vowels
(ā, ī, ū).The categoriesof additional vowelsdescribed bythe grammarianshave
already been discussed in section §2.2.2 and here we will examine how these
forms are distributed across the readers.
3.3.3.1
Hollow Root Passives
As we saw in section §2.2.2.5, the Arab grammarians report three different
vocalic options for the passives of hollow roots, which according to al-Farrāʔ
can be attributed to the following tribes:
1.
People of the Hijaz (Qurayš and those that neighbor them): xīfa/xifnā,
bīʕa/biʕnā, qīla/qilnā.
2.
Qays, ʕuqayl, and majority of ʔasad: xǖfa/xüfnā, bǖʕa/büʕnā, qǖla/qülnā
3.
Banū Faqʕas and Banū Dubayr branches of ʔasad: xūfa/xufnā, būʕa/buʕ-
nā, qūla/qulnā.
Ibn al-Ǧazarī (§2629) reports that al-Kisāʔī,23 Hišām ʕan ibn ʕāmir, Ruways
ʕan Yaʕqūb all read in the manner of Qays, ʕuqayl and ʔasad for all the verbs
qǖla, ġǖḍa, ǧǖʔa,ḥǖla,sǖqa,sǖʔa,sǖʔat.24Theseareallthehollowrootpassives
23
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 14) also explicitly mentions that al-Kisāʔī reads it as such and that many
of the readers followed him in it.
24
Rabin (Chaim Rabin 1951, 159) puzzlingly states that “the Kufan Kisāʾī, however, read in
each case ü […]. Apparently the Classical language adopted the forms with ü, but with the
Hijazi spelling.” It is difficult to understand what Rabin means by this, but the underlying
assumption seems to be that “Classical Arabic”—the Arabic as considered normatively

67
present in the Quran. More mixed is the treatment of this class by other read-
ers. Ibn Ḏakwān ʕan ibn ʕāmir reads only the verbs ḥǖla, sǖqa, sǖʔa, sǖʔat while
the other verbs that are expected to undergo this development are read with
the Hijazi ī vowel. Likewise, Nāfiʕ and ʔabū Ǧaʕfar only read sǖʔa, sǖʔat and
read the rest with ī. All other canonical readers consistently follow the Hijazi
practice.
3.3.3.2
Hollow Root ʔimālah
Hollow root ʔimālah as found in hollow verbs that have an i vowel with con-
sonant initial suffix forms (e.g. ṭēba/ṭibtu), as discussed in section §2.2.2.3, is
attributed to Tamīm, ʔasad and Qays by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 17) and to some peo-
ple of the Hijaz according to Sībawayh (iv, 120). Among the canonical readers,
only Ḥamzah has this type of ʔimālah quite regularly. He applies it to zēda ‘to
increase’, šēʔa ‘to want’, ǧēʔa ‘to come’, xēba ‘to fail’, rēna ‘to seize’, xēfa ‘to fear’,
zēġa ‘to wander’, ṭēba ‘to be good’, ḍēqa ‘to taste’ and ḥēqa ‘to surround’, and
any other form of these verbs where the long vowel is retained, such as zēda-
humandǧēʔū(Ibnal-Ǧazarī,§2063).Whileheisfairlyconsistentinthisregard,
Ḥamzahfailstoapplythisʔimālahtomāta‘hedied’,25kālū-hum‘theymeasured
them’ (Q83:3; kiltum Q17:35), zālat ‘(did not) cease’ (Q21:15; ziltum Q40:34). He
also makes an exception for zāġat (Q33:10; Q38:63) although other forms of this
verb do undergo ʔimālah.26
So even within Ḥamzah’s reading, which is the closest to the regular applica-
tion of this type of ʔimālah, this sound change has irregular lexical exceptions.
The other readers are less regular in its application. Ibn Ḏakwān and Xalaf only
applied ʔimālah for forms of the verb šēʔa ‘he wanted’ and ǧēʔa ‘he came’, and
Ibn Ḏakwān adds to this zēda ‘he increased’. All transmissions agree that he
applied it to fa-zēda-hum (Q2:10), but the others are a cause for disagreement
among his transmitters. There is also disagreement as to whether Ibn Ḏakwān
reads xēba‘tofail’(Ibnal-Ǧazarī,§2064–2065).Fortheothertransmitterof Ibn
acceptable by the Arab grammarians—could only have one of these forms, rather than
all three. It is difficult to reconstruct what caused Rabin to conclude that “the Classical
language” had ǖ and only ǖ. It seems to stem from the fact that al-Kisāʔī read it as such,
apparently assuming that this Quranic reader and grammarian could not have recited in
any other language but the “Classical language”. But if this is what Rabin meant, I do not
understand what he would make of the majority of readers that read with ī instead.
25
Ḥamzah consistently has an i vowel in the short stem, which means it would require
ʔimālah according to the grammarians, ibn al-Ǧazarī (§2881).
26
Ibn al-Ǧazarī adds that ibn Mihrān transmits in the transmission of Xallād that zēġat does
undergo ʔimālah.

chapter 3
ʕāmir, Hišām, there is disagreement whether the words šēʔa, ǧēʔa, zēda and
xēba are to be read with ʔimālah (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2066). Finally, al-Kisāʔī, Xalaf
and Šuʕbah read rēna (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2067). From this overview it should be
clear that not a single one of the readers consistently follows a regular dialectal
distribution for this development.
3.3.3.3
Phonemic Ē on iii-y Nouns and Verbs
As discussed in section §2.2.2.2, some forms of Arabic made a distinction be-
tween the ʔalif maqṣūrah written with ʔalif and with yāʔ. Those written with
yāʔ, being mostly iii-y roots, derived forms and the feminine ending such as
in ḥublē ‘pregnant’ have a phonemic vowel -ē. According to al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt,
21) the people of the Najd had ramē ‘to throw’, qaḍē ‘to conclude, decree’ etc.
whereas the people of the Hijaz had ramā, qaḍā etc. for iii-y verbs, while both
have -ā for iii-w verbs. Al-Kisāʔī and Ḥamzah are well-known for having this
phonemic distinction (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1968). Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ (along the most
popular transmissions in the path of al-ʔazraq) likewise retains this distinction
but has a lower realization ǟ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §2023).27These three can therefore
be seen as having a fairly regular reflex of this development.
Other readers apply ʔimālah only sporadically: Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim reads it only
once in maǧrē-hā (Q11:41, Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1992). Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim reads it for
reʔē ‘he saw’ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2004),28 ramē ‘he threw’ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1996)
whenever they occur, and ʔaʕmē ‘blind’ in its two attestations in Q17:72, and
not in any of its 12 other attestations (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1998). ʔabū ʕamr has a
special, and rather artificial treatment which will be discussed in more detail
in §3.6.6.1 below.This highly lexically specified application of the iii-y ʔimālah
is unlikely to be the result of natural language change.
3.3.4
Lexically Determined i-umlaut ʔimālah
The Arab grammarians recognize multiple types of ʔimālah, two of these we
have discussed already and must essentially be thought of as representing a
phonemic distinction between ē and ā. However, the type of the ʔimālah that
takes up the largest amount of Sībawayh’s discussion is best thought of as a
form of i-umlaut where any ā that is adjacent to an i or ī is raised to ē, unless it is
directly adjacent to one of the emphatic (ṣ, ḍ, ṭ, ẓ) or uvular consonants (q, ġ, x)
or if any of these consonants occur later in the word. This conditioning is well-
27
Ibn Muǧāhid (145) reports ǟ for both Warš and Qālūn. Ibn al-Ǧazarī reports the reading of
Qālūn from a different transmitter.

known and quite similar to several modern Arabic dialects.29 While this type
of ʔimālah is frequently attributed by modern scholars to the tribes of Najd,
or more specifically Tamīm, Sībawayh’s comprehensive description does not
explicitlyattributedittoanyeasterntribe,onlymentioningthatthatthepeople
of the Hijaz never apply ʔimālah in such cases. Al-Farrāʔ is much less system-
atic in his description of this phenomenon, but more explicit in which tribes
do apply it. He reports the people of the Hijaz back the vowel (yufaxximūna) of
الكافرونwhereas the people of Najd among the Tamīm and Qays say al-kēfirūna
(yušīrūna ʔilā l-kāfi bi-l-kasr).
While the ʔimālah of this type is clearly non-phonemic in Sībawayh’s de-
scription, and mostly the result of a regular predictable historical process in
the modern dialects that have it as well, oddly enough its occurrences in the
Quranic reading traditions are highly lexically determined. The transmitters
of Ibn ʕāmir most frequently apply this type of i-umlaut ʔimālah, but even
for this reader it is entirely lexically determined and most of the nouns that
would qualify following Sībawayh’s description do not undergo it. Ibn al-Ǧazarī
(§2068–2083) discusses these cases, and they have been summarized below.
Both Hišām and Ibn Ḏakwān (according to some transmission paths) apply
the i-umlaut to one case of an unemphatic CaCāCiC plural, namely, mašēribu
‘drinks’ (Q36:73). However other words that qualify just as well for this shift,
are not read in such a way, for example al-ǧawāriḥi ‘the predators’ (Q5:4), al-
ḥanāǧira ‘the throats’ (Q33:10), manāzila ‘positions’ (Q36:39), and even man-
āfiʕu ‘benefits’ which is the word that directly precedes mašēribu in Q36:73.
Hišām (according to some transmission paths) also applies i-umlaut to one
CāCiCah noun, namely, ʔēniyatin ‘boiling’ (Q88:5) while other nouns of the
same shape, such as ʔātiyah ‘coming’ (Q15:85; Q20:15; Q22:7; Q40:59) do not
undergo it.
The noun ʕēbidun and ʕēbidūna undergo i-umlaut in Hišām’s transmission
(again according to some transmission paths) in Q109, 3, 4, 5 but not in any
of its other attestations. So, without i-umlaut are ʕābidūna (Q2:138; Q23:47), al-
ʕābidūna (Q9:112), ʕābidīna (Q21:53, 73, 106), li-l-ʕābidīna (Q21:84); al-ʕābidīna
(Q43:81) and ʕābidātin (Q66:5). As such, the i-umlaut of this word is not just
lexically determined, but determined by position in the Quranic text.30 This
is especially striking because another word that would have qualified in this

Phonemic distinctions determined by the position in the text are a phenomenon also
found in the reading tradition of the Hebrew Bible (Suchard 2018, 200).

chapter 3
Surah, namely, al-kāfirūna (Q109:1) does not undergo the ʔimālah. One there-
fore cannot argue that Hišām is transmitting this single Sūrah in a different
dialect that did undergo the ʔimālah.
Similar irregularity can be seen for Ibn ʕāmir’s other transmitter Ibn Ḏak-
wān, who has an i-umlaut on some, but not all, nouns with the shape CiC-
CāC. He read al-miḥrēb, and ʕimrēn, al-ʔikrēm and ʔikrēhi-hinna in its one
attestation (Q24:33) (the latter three all in only some transmission paths) but
other nouns are not affected, e.g. zilzālan (Q33:11), al-ʔislām (Q61:7), ʔiḥsānan
(Q46:15). Finally, Ibn Ḏakwān (in some transmission paths) reads ʔimālah in
the words al-ḥawēriyyīna and li-š-šēribīna.
Ḥamzah has an even more limited application, only using it in the phrase
ʔana ʔētī-ka bi-hī (Q27:39, 40) but for example not **ʔētī-kum (Q28:29). Besides
this he has i-umlaut in ḍiʕēfan (Q4:9).
A final example is the i-umlaut in the pronunciation of (al-)kēfirīna ‘the dis-
believers’ by ʔabū ʕamr and al-Dūrī ʕan al-Kisāʔī (nb not with the nominative
(al-)kāfirūna, which would qualify in Sībawayh’s definition). Warš also has his
distinctive in-between ʔimālah (ǟ) for this word only.
Sībawayh’s system clearly represents a linguistic reality, and its linguistic
reality is confirmed by the fact that it describes the system as found in many
modern dialects quite accurately. This i-umlaut is attested among several dif-
ferent canonical readers. But nowhere does it form the regular, phonetically
conditioned system in the way that Sībawayh describes it. This is unexpected
if we take the Quranic readings as a reflection of a natural language.
3.3.5
Dual Deictics
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 94) reports a clear split of the deictic system between the
Hijaz and Najd when it comes to the dual deictics. Qays and Tamīm have
hāḏānni (proximal masculine), hātaynni (proximal feminine) and ḏānnika
(distal masculine). These same tribes also have allaḏānni, allaḏaynni for the
dual relative pronoun. The dialect of the Hijaz and ʔasad have a -āni/-ayni in
all these cases.
The Meccan Ibn Kaṯīr has the Qays and Tamīm form for both the proxi-
mal and the distal: hāḏānni (Q20:63; Q22:19) hātaynni (Q28:27), fa-ḏānnika
(Q28:32) as well as the dual relative pronoun allaḏānni, allaḏaynni (Q4:16;
Q41:29). The Basrans ʔabū ʕamr and Yaʕqūb follow Ibn Kaṯīr in using the east-
ern form only for the distal demonstrative fa-ḏānnika (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §2915).
The other canonical readers, however, adhere to Hijazi and ʔasad forms of the
deictics and relative pronoun.

Dialectal Difference in Short Vowels
3.3.6.1
Cu/iCiyy(ah)
The Fuʕūl(ah) nouns for iii-y can either retain the initial u as per the Hijazi
practice, or they can have a harmonized i, as per the practice of ʔasad and those
who surround them (al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 68).31 Once again we find that there is sig-
nificant disagreement among the readers whether to follow the Hijazi or ʔasadī
practice, although for ʕiṣiyy all readers agree on the ʔasadī form (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§3143, §3549). Probably related to this development is the pronunciation of
ḏurriyyah as ḏirriyyah ‘offspring’ (al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 39). In this case al-Farrāʔ is
less specific and says the people of the Hijaz say ḏurriyyah and ‘other Arabs’
say ḏirriyyah. But it seems safe to consider this part of the same development.
There is consensus on the Hijazi pronunciation of this word.
The noun Q24:35ذرى
‘shining’, read variously as durriyyun, dirrīʔun, dur-
rīʔun (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §3731) is plausibly explained as a nisbah derivation of durr
‘pearls’. This yields more or less the same phonetic environment as the CuCiyy
nouns discussed so far, and thus undergoes the same development. The word-
final ʔ present among some of the readers is likely pseudocorrect (see §6.4.6).
The Table below illustrates the forms and shows that not a single one of the
readers shows a regular pattern, though the Hijazi pronunciation is most com-
mon, H = Hijazi, A = Asad, +ʔ = the word has a stem-final ʔ.

Presumably the vowel harmony of CuCyah nouns towards CiCyah is related to this phe-
nomenon. This is reported by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 64, 74). He attributed the xifyah pronunci-
ation to Quḍāʕah whereas miryah is attributed more broadly to the Hijaz, while muryah is
considered the ʔasad and Tamīm form. There is consensus among the readers on reading
xufyah and miryah.

3.3.6.2
CiCwān Nouns
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 47, 62, 77) on multiple occasions reports that nouns that his-
torically probably had the shape *CiCwān undergo harmony of the high vowel
*i to u under influence of the following w among the Qays and Tamīm, while
thevowelremainsiintheHijaz.Thefourwordsexplicitlydiscussedbyal-Farrāʔ
that show this dialectal distribution in the Quran are riḍwān ‘approval’, ʔixwān
‘brothers’, qinwān ‘cluster of dates’ and ṣinwān ‘trees growing from a single root’.
For ʔixwān, qinwān and ṣinwān there is complete consensus on the Hijazi
form among the Quranic readers. For riḍwān most readers read riḍwān in all
contexts, but Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim always reads ruḍwān with the exception of
Q5:16, where he reads it as riḍwān (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2832).
Besides this, we must likely also include ʕudwān, ʕidwān ‘enmity’ in this dis-
cussion, which is recorded by the Arabic lexicographical tradition with both
forms (Lisān, 2846b). There is consensus among the Quranic readings on the
Qays/Tamīm form ʕudwān.
3.3.6.3
Mit- and Dim-
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 49) tells us that the hollow verbs māta ‘to die’ and dāma ‘to
last’ have a vowel u in the short stem mutta and dumta among the people of the
Hijaz, while theTamīm have mitta and dimta. From a comparative perspective,
it is clear that for māta at least, the form with an *i vowel is original, having
developed from an earlier *mawita (Suchard 2016; van Putten 2017a). This is
less clear for dāma, but seems likely as well. The readers display a highly mixed
treatment of these forms for māta where Ḥafṣeven uses both forms in specific
locations in the Quran (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2881). There is, however, full consensus
on the Hijazi form for the dāma.33

Disagreement in Pluralization
The plural of ʔasīr ‘prisoner’ among the people of the Hijaz is ʔusārā. The peo-
ple of the Najd most commonly use ʔasrā (Al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 29). Al-Farrāʔ goes
on to say that the plural ʔasrā “is the best of the two options in Arabic, because
it has a similar pattern as ǧarīḥpl. ǧarḥā and ṣarīʕ pl. ṣarʕā.” This plural occurs
three times in the Quran, and there is significant disagreement on which form
is to be used, most readers in fact use both the Hijazi and the Najdi forms (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §2708, 3192).

Cu/iyūC Plurals
Therearesomecaseswherewelikewisefindunexpectedandmixedtreatments
even when the early grammarians whom we examine here do not explicitly
attribute these forms to specific dialects. This is the case, for example, for the
plurals of several CayC nouns like bayt ‘house’, ġayb ‘a hidden thing’, ʕayn ‘eye,
well’, ǧayb ‘bosom’ and šayx ‘elder’ which show disagreement of the first vowel
of the plural stem. Sībawayh (iii, 589) describes these explicitly as having a

buyūt, biyūt and büyūt. He considers the last of these three to be the best and
most common.

for al-Kisāʔī, one of the manuscripts used in the edition has an extra anony-

mous attribution that reports the front rounded vowel ü for al-Kisāʔī (probably
only those reported with i, but the wording is ambiguous).34 For Ḥamzah, he
reports that he pronounces i for all of these words, but that Xalaf and (the
now non-canonical transmitter) ʔabū Hišām ←Sulaym ←Ḥamzah read ǧüyū-
bihinna. Ǧüyūbihinna is also reported for Yaḥyā b. ʔādam ←Šuʕbah ←ʕāṣim.
Al-Dānī (Ǧāmiʕ, 416f.) brings many more transmissions with büyūt-type plu-
rals, for all three Kufans. The forms with the front rounded vowel have been
lost in the canonical transmissions as they are adhered to today (and reported
on by al-Dānī taysīr and Ibn al-Ǧazarī), but it is clear that this was once quite
popular in the Kufan tradition, which helps us understand al-Farrāʔ’s approv-
ing tone of this pronunciation.
The shift of *uy > iy is otherwise very irregular, something we would not
expect if it had been the outcome of a regular sound shift. Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ, ʔabū
ʕamr and Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim, ʔabū Ǧaʕfar and Yaʕqūb all regularly have CuyūC,
whereasḤamzah(inthenow-canonicaltransmission)regularlyhasCiyūC.The
remaining readers all have a single exception to their general pattern, though
which word constitutes the exception differs per reader (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2755).

reading traditions.This is rather surprising from the perspective of the descrip-
tions of the grammarians, who clearly present these processes as regular rules,
often stating explicitly things like ‘those who say wa-l-yafʕal also say wa-hwa’.
The readings fail to reflect any regular relation of the sort presented by the
grammarians. The lack of regular sound change clearly implies that the read-
ings do not reflect any form of natural language.
Seemingly irregular outcomes of sound changes may be the result of bor-
rowing between closely related languages (Hock 1991, 47ff.).While in principle,
one could try to explain what we find in the readings in this manner, the sheer
amount of dialect borrowing that would have to be assumed and the lack of
clear patterns among the readers would be difficult to square with the data as
presented by the grammarians. Alternatively, one might imagine we are look-
ing at several sound changes in progress. As Labov (1994, Part D, pp. 419–543)
shows, sound change can surface as irregular distributions of the sound change
in ways that are not entirely predictable while the sound change is still in
progress. One might imagine that some of the sound changes discussed above
may be understood as part of this kind of distribution, fossilized in time as the
reading traditions were transmitted with the utmost precision. However, the
great amount of sound changes that would have to be considered to have been
caught ‘mid shift’ by the Quranic reading traditions would be highly unusual,
especially considering the fact that the Arab grammarians, active around the
same period as the readers of these reading traditions give no indication what-
soever that these shifts were changes in progress, and rather point to regularly
conditioned sound changes that can be clearly formulated, and by all intents
and purposes seem complete in the different dialects they are attributed to.
Therefore, the chaotic situation that we see among the canonical readers
must, in part, be the result of conscious incorporation of different linguistic
forms into a single reading. The exact motivation for the haphazard incorpora-
tionof suchfeaturesisnotreadilyrecoverable.Itseemsclearthatsomeamount

coincidence that threeof the fourKufanreadersall haveregularphonemic ē on

Student relationships that Ḥamzah, al-Kisāʔī and Xalaf have with one another.
As ʕāṣim falls outside that cluster, only sharing a teacher several generations
higher up, his deviation from the Kufan norm can be understood.35

For teacher student-relationships I have relied here on the description of al-Dānī (taysīr,
9–10). Other sources report slightly different details as to how Ḥamzah relates to al-
Sulamī, reporting that he learned from ʔabū ʔisḥāq, who studied directly under al-Sulamī,
whereas, Yaḥyā b. Waṯṯāb did not learn from al-Sulamī (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §751–752).

iii-y ʔimālah among Kufan Reciters
While teacher student relations can explain some amount of the variation,
many of the disagreements are not easily explained in this manner. If we turn,
for example, to the syncopation of CuCuC nouns (§3.3.2.3), we are confronted
with a striking lack of agreement between the two Medinan readers ʔabū Ǧaʕ-
far and Nāfiʕ, while the latter is a direct student of the former. Likewise, the dis-
agreements between nouns of this type between Ḥamzah, Xalaf and al-Kisāʔī

(e.g. Q18:74) it is al-Kisāʔī and Ḥamzah

3.4
The Readings Are Not Dialects
It should be clear from the discussion in section §3.3 that there is a signifi-
cant amount of linguistic variation present in the Quranic reading traditions.
These linguistic differences between the readings are often explained today as
being the result of regional pronunciations or dialects of Arabic. This is a view
commonly espoused by Muslim scholars and laypeople alike, as it is believed
that the prophet Muhammad taught his followers in their native dialect, some-
timesclaimingthattheangelGabrielrevealedittotheprophetassuch(As-Said

1975, 53; al-Azami 2003, 62f., 154f.). This is not a view that seems to have been
endorsed in the early qirāʔāt works, but that of course need not mean that this
is incorrect.
The report is easily dismissed in its most literal interpretation, though. It is
readily apparent that Hijazi readers do not employ Hijazi pronominal forms,
for example. Likewise, a client of ʔasad (such as ʕāṣim) does not exclusively
use ʔasadī forms. Of course, it need not be the case that a reader would be
employing his own local dialect, but we find that none of the readers stick to
regional forms with any consistency at all. For example, the widespread syn-
copation and vowel harmony associated with the eastern tribes only shows up
erratically in the reading traditions with no obvious patterns discernable.
Especially in the general principles of the readings—widespread features
that apply regularly to words whenever they occur—we do find some regional
trends. Van Putten & Sidky (forthcoming), for example, show that the use of
long plural pronouns of the type ʔantumū, humū, ʕalay-himū etc. is typical for
the Hijazi readers, not just the canonical ʔabū Ǧaʕfar, Nāfiʕ (both Medina) and
Ibn Kaṯīr (Mecca), but also the non-canonical Meccan Ibn Muḥayṣin. Yet, the
Arab grammarians are explicit in pointing out that this is not a regional dialec-
tal feature, but an option for any speaker of Arabic of whatever tribe.
One could, of course, call into question the accuracy of the reports of the
grammarians. Perhaps, for some reason, the reports about the dialectal fea-
tures simply did not map onto reality in any way. It is difficult to envision
a motivation for the grammarians to fabricate a vast and intricate system of
dialectological data that was agreed upon by the otherwise rivalrous grammat-
ical schools of Basra and Kufa. Moreover, the data they present often seems to
show a clear and regular application of sound laws, which makes these devel-
opments look like natural linguistic data even though the concept of regular
sound laws was not part of the framework of the grammarians, which makes
such data look even more natural.
Had this data been fabricated, we would expect it to serve (and be employed
for) theological or ideological purposes. It would, for example, have been quite
advantageous for al-Farrāʔ to claim that all the features that the readers have
(or at least what his teacher al-Kisāʔī or the other Kufan readers read), were a
perfect reflection of the dialect of the Qurayš and therefore the most eloquent
and authentic form of recitation, but this is not what he reports. Very often al-
Farrāʔ explicitly mentions the reading of the Kufan readers even when they
are at odds with the dialectal forms of the Hijazis or Qurayš. An example of
this is the presence of the vowel ǖ in hollow root passives (§3.3.3.1), which al-
Farrāʔ explicitly attributes to his teacher, al-Kisāʔī, while also explicitly calling
it a non-Hijazi form.

chapter 3
Further evidence for a lack of correlation of readers to any one dialect may
be found among lexical isoglosses. Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt) discusses many differ-
ences between the dialects in the vocalism of specific lexical items. In most
cases these seem to be different stem formations, in line with a certain free-
dom of stem formation seen across the Semitic languages (Fox 2013, 102ff.).
With such cases we once again find significant disagreement among the read-
ers, where each of the readers incorporates forms from a variety of different
dialects. I will discuss these variants in the list below. Each lexical item will be
listed with the tribe or region its associated with, followed by the page number
where this is mentioned in al-Farrāʔ’s work. After that the reading that has the
fewest readers in agreement is mentioned. The unmentioned remainder then
has the remaining form.

As with the sound laws discussed in the previous section, it is clear that the
reading traditions are highly mixed, showing features of different dialects.
There is not a single ‘base’ from which readers have then occasionally imported
regional dialectisms. In fact, one frequently finds the opposite trend. For exam-
ple, in the case of reading ka-ʔayyin versus kāʔin, we find that only the Hijazi
readers have the Najdi forms, while all the non-Hijazi readers have the Hijazi
forms. Likewise, the readers whose pronominal systems contain the most Hi-
jaziformsareḤamzah(Kufa)andYaʕqūb(Basra),whereasalltheHijazireaders
have perfectly Najdi forms.
Assumingthattherewasasingle‘standard’ʕarabiyyah—whichforsomerea-
son does not get explicitly described by the grammarians—we would have to
conclude that readers are moving away from an accepted standard by incorpo-
rating features that were explicitly not local to them. Considering the complete
silenceof thegrammariansof thissinglestandard,thisstrikesmeasanassump-
tion we cannot make based on the evidence at hand. Rather, the data seems to
suggest that through a process of imperfect transmission and explicit choices,
the readers assembled their own reading of the Quran, with no regard as to
whether this amalgamation of linguistic features had ever occurred in a single
dialect of the ʕarabiyyah.

Readers Usually Agree on the Hijazi Form
So far, we have discussed many phonological, morphological and lexical iso-
glosses that are reported as differences among the Arabic dialects by the Arab
grammarians. We see that very often readers have no real consensus on what

dialectal form to use, and that even within a single reading, an alternation
between different dialectal forms occurs. These disagreements are frequent
andclearlyshowthattheQuranicreadingscannotbethoughtof as“dialects”of
Arabic. Nevertheless, there are still many examples where al-Farrāʔ mentions
differences in specific words and grammar, where all the readers are in agree-
ment amongst one another.
Onemightimaginethatthepointswherethereadersagreewithoneanother
is what could be considered the “Classical Arabic” base. However, whenever
such consensus exists, almost invariably, the readers agree on the form attri-
buted to the Hijaz. These cases clearly far outnumber the cases where there
is disagreement among the canonical readers. By and large the basis of all the
Quranic readings therefore seems to be Hijazi Arabic.This is already clear from
some of the classes discussed above. While CuCuCāt forms do show a couple
cases where the Najdi syncopated CuCCāt form is employed, the majority of
the cases show agreement among the readers on the Hijazi form. The same is
true for CuCuC, CaCiC(ah) nouns, CiCwān nouns etc.
In cases of complete agreement among the readers, the consensus almost
always falls upon the Hijazi form. For example, the grammarians inform us
that the initial vowel of the prefix conjugation of verbs is i when the second
vowel is a (i.e. ʔifhamu ‘I understand’) among the Tamīm, whereas the Hijazis
have the innovative a vowel there (i.e. ʔafhamu) (see §2.2.5). There is con-
sensus among the canonical readers to read all of these forms in the Hijazi
manner.
Also, when it comes to lexical isoglosses, the vast majority of the cases men-
tioned by al-Farrāʔ there is consensus on the Hijazi form. Below follows a list
of some of the words where two local variants are mentioned by al-Farrāʔ, but

– baxalat (Hijaz), baxilat (Arabs), p. 53. Consensus on baxila.
3.6
The Readings Are Intentionally Artificial
As we have seen above, none of the readings make up any single consistent
linguistic system, nor do they show a clear signal of any one dialect of Ara-
bic. Instead, they are an mix of different dialectal forms, distributed in a way
from which no obvious pattern can be deduced. The linguistic character of
the reading traditions appears to be the result of an artificial amalgamation
of different features. In the following sections we will develop this further.
We will argue that the irregular patterns we see are not just the result of—
perhaps faulty—transmission, but that this configuration of exotic features
was to some extent the express purpose of the readers. The lack of regular pat-
terns in the application of sound laws as we saw in §3.3 could be understood as
the result of unintentional mixing. One may imagine that native varieties inter-
fering with incomplete and conflicting reports on how to recite certain words
in the context of a nascent grammatical theory could lead to such mixing,

chapter 3
although the reasons and patterns cannot meaningfully be deduced from the
reading traditions as they have come down to us.
However, this cannot account for all linguistic variation among the reading
traditions. In several cases we find that certain general rules that are operative
in the readings are highly dependent on Arabic grammatical theory. And it is
difficult to imagine how users of the language could have employed these rules
before the development of this theoretical framework. In other cases, we find
examples of complex conditioning that is dependent not on grammatical the-
ory but on the very structure of the text, keeping in mind strictly where the
verse divisions are, for example. Finally, there are many cases of lexical spec-
ification of certain sound laws. In several cases, readers will follow a regular
phonological rule, only to be broken a single time in a single word. In several
cases this involves words that occur in their regular form elsewhere in the text.
Such features do not point to a genuine (and perhaps failed) attempt to
transmit the Quran verbatim, as, for example Versteegh (1984, 10), following
Beck (1945; 1946) claims the situation was in the first half of the 8th century ce.
Rather, such features should be seen as a deliberate attempt at showcasing a
reader’s knowledge of the text and grammar, including complex structures not
otherwise attested within the description of Arabic.
Many of the general principles that take place in the Quranic readings are
only made possible because Arabic grammatical theory allows readers to for-
mulate complex grammatically conditioned changes. But this does not mean
that the Quranic readings fall within the purview of the descriptions of the
Arab grammarians. While much, if not all, of the linguistic variation that we
find in the Hadith and poetry fall within the possible variations described by
the grammarians, the reading traditions very often have features and linguistic
rules that transcend the boundaries of linguistic variation that the Arab gram-
marians describe.36 Moreover, the readings often go beyond what we might
expect to occur in natural language. In the following sections I will describe
some of the artificial features as they are present in the Quranic reading tradi-
tions.
36
While this statement strikes me as true in principle, I warn the reader not to essentialize
it too much. The Quranic readings have a complex and specialized oral and written tradi-
tion that keeps track of highly specific phonological and morphological rules that govern
these readings. The Hadith and poetic corpus do not enjoy the same specialized tradition
when it comes to communicating specific linguistic facts. It may very well be the case that
these corpora also had linguistic features that go beyond what the grammarians describe;
the incessant move towards classicizing these corpora as already pointed out by Rabin
(1955, 21) to norms stricter than what the Arab grammarians allow, and more towards the

3.6.1
The Dropping of the Hamzah by Warš
Warš, one of the two canonical transmitters of Nāfiʕ, is well known for his fre-
quentdroppingof thehamzahwithcompensatorylengtheningsuchas yaʔkulu
> yākulu, yastaʔxirūna > yastāxirūna or with the replacement with a glide
when the hamzah occurs intervocalically yuʔaxxiru-hum > yuwaxxiru-hum.
Regular dropping of the hamzah is by no means unique to Warš. ʔabū Ǧaʕ-
far regularly and ʔabū ʕamr optionally drop any pre-consonantal hamzah (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §1466; §1472–1474). However, the dropping of the hamzah of Warš’
traditionisnotuniversal.Itexclusivelyappliestothehamzahwhenitisthefirst
root consonant, thus he reads yākulu but ar-raʔsu; mūmin and muwaḏḏinun
but luʔluʔan (Al-Dānī taysīr, 34; Ibn al-Ǧazarī, ii, 1230f., 1240f.). The difference
between first, second and third root consonants is a morphological one, and a
concept that was known to medieval grammarians, but not something that we
would expect to be a factor in natural language change. In historical linguis-
tics, we consider language change as taking place on the phonological surface
form, and being purely phonetically conditioned (Hock 1991, 34–51); this is not
the case for Warš’ dropping of the hamzah, as it is dependent on grammatical
theory.Thiswayof recitationthereforecannothavebeenintroducedbeforethe
development of Arabic grammatical theory, and therefore cannot be projected
back to manners of recitation among the first generations after the standard-
ization of the Quran.
3.6.2
The ʔimālah of Word-Final Āri Sequences
A similar case of sound change dependent on grammatical theory is found
with the raising of ā to ē (ʔabū ʕamr; al-Dūrī ʕan al-Kisāʔī; Ibn Ḏakwān ʕan
Ibn ʕāmir) or ǟ (Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ) next to ri. This rule, which clearly represents
a kind of i-umlaut, occurs for several different readers, but their principles all
have one thing in common: āri only raises if the r is the third root consonant,
or formulated differently: if -i is the vowel that marks the genitive case (al-Dānī
Taysīr, 51; Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2046–2062).
On the surface, this type of ʔimālah looks very similar to the ʔimālah involv-
ing āri as described by Sībawayh (see §2.2.2.1 and Sībawayh, iv 136ff., Sara
2007, 82ff.). While to Sībawayh the sequence āri is stronger than other se-
quences of āCi, and therefore can undergo ʔimālah for example if the preced-
ing consonant is uvular or emphatic, it is clear from his description that those
that have ʔimālah of the sequence āri also have it, for example, in kātib > kētib.
standard form of Classical Arabic make it very difficult to judge to what extent the mate-
rial can be trusted. These corpora deserve an in-depth and careful study of their features
too.

chapter 3
However, the readers that have this type of ʔimālah exclusively apply it with
āri, and not with other sequences.
Even if one does not accept that āri ʔimālah applies only in dialects that
have other forms of ʔimālah too (Sībawayh is not very explicit about this),
the behaviour in the readings is still markedly different from what Sībawayh
describes. While the genitive case vowel can indeed cause ʔimālah e.g. min
ʕawāri-hī →min ʕawēri-hī ‘from his blindness’ and, mina d-duʕāri →mina d-
duʕēri ‘from dizziness’, it is by no means the case that only the genitive i can
be the cause of this ʔimālah, thus Sībawayh cites forms like qārib →qērib ‘boat’
and ṭārid →ṭērid ‘expeller’.
For none of the Quranic readings however, such word-internal āri ʔimālahs
take place. Thus we see nārin →nērin ‘fire’ (Q7:12; Q22:19; Q38:76; Q55:15, 35);
an-nahāri →an-nahēri ‘the day’ (Q2:164) but not active participles like laysa bi-
xāriǧin →**laysa bi-xēriǧin ‘not coming out’ (Q6:122), al-wāriṯ→**al-wēriṯ‘the
heir’ (Q2:233), or verbs like yuḥāribūna →**yuḥēribūna (Q5:33),37 ʔuwāriya →
**ʔuwēriya‘Ihide’(Q5:31),orpluralslikemašāriqaal-ʔarḍiwa-maġāriba-hā‘the
eastern regions of the land and the western ones’ (Q7:137). These are all forms
that would undergo this development if we would follow Sībawayh’s descrip-
tion. While one can envision that in such productive morphological patterns,
the forms without ʔimālah might be analogically levelled to forms that are oth-
erwise expected to undergo ʔimālah,38 such an explanation cannot be invoked
with all nouns that fail to undergo the āriʔimālah. For example, al-ḥawāriyyīna
(Q5:111) al-ḥawāriyyūna (Q5:112; Q61:14), li-l-ḥawāriyyīna (Q61:14) ‘the disciples’
is a unique noun formation due to its status as an Ethiopic loanword (< Gəʕəz
ḥäwari ‘traveler’). It seems that the āri-ʔimālah found among the readers is an
artificial rule that requires a clearly developed grammatical theory. Those who
apply need to distinguish when a certain sequence is a final root consonant,
something that would not be possible without the formal linguistic model of
the consonantal root.
The extent of grammatical thinking that is involved in the application of
this rule becomes clear when we examine nouns with the exact same phonetic
37
Note however that prefix conjugation forms of sāraʕa ‘to hasten’ undergo ʔimālah in the
readingof al-Dūrīʕanal-Kisāʔī yusēriʕūna(Q3:114,176;Q5:41,52,62;Q21:90;Q23:61),nusēr-
iʕu (Q23:56) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1980).
38
A development in the opposite direction is found in Maltese, for example, where all active
participles undergo ʔimālah, even if they historically contain consonants that would
have blocked it, e.g. ħieles ‘being free’ << xāliṣon the pattern of liebes ‘being dressed’ <
lābis, while lexicalized words of this pattern do have blocked ʔimālah: ħakem ‘governor’ <
ḥākim.

shape with āri word-finally, but where the -i is not the genitive case vowel. A
word like al-ǧawāri ‘the ships’ (Q42:32; Q55:24; Q81:16) is not included in this
shift because it comes from the root √ǧry with a shortened final vowel, like-
wise it is not applied to fa-lā tumāri ‘do not argue’ (Q18:22) because the root
is √mry. In other words, these readings make a distinction in the application
of ʔimālah depending on whether the final -i is ǧarr/xafḍ(the inflectional -i)
or kasr (the non-inflectional -i), and is thus morphologically rather than pho-
netically conditioned. This conditioning therefore does not look like a natural
sound change, and moreover, falls outside the purview of what the Arab gram-
marians describe.
The other transmitter of al-Kisāʔī, ʔabū al-Ḥāriṯhas an even more specific
conditioning for āri-ʔimālah. He only applies ʔimālah in these cases if the last
root consonant is an r followed by the genitive i, but only if the root under
consideration is a geminate root, so al-ʔabrāri →al-ʔabrēri but not al-ʔaxbāri
→**al-ʔaxbēri (al-Dānī Taysīr, 51; Ibn al-Ǧazarī, iii, 1676). Such specific condi-
tioning of ʔimālah falls completely outside of the types of ʔimālah described
by the Arab grammarians.
3.6.3
Vowel Harmony of -hum in Ruways ʕan Yaʕqūb’s Reading
Another illustrative example where we see the reading traditions in dialogue
with the grammatical tradition, leading to an artificial treatment of the pro-
nominal suffixes is the one found in Ruways’ transmission of Yaʕqūb. Yaʕqūb’s
basic rules shared between his two transmitters, Rawḥand Ruways, already
fall well outside of the kind of variation that Sībawayh and other grammari-
ans describe. To the grammarians it is clear that i, ī and ay preceding either the
singular or plural pronouns may trigger vowel harmony (yielding -hi, -hī, -him,
-himā, etc.) or may be avoided, as is the Hijazi practice. Yaʕqūb, however, has
a different kind of conditioning. For the 3rd person singular ending, the con-
ditioning is harmonized as with all other readers if it follows i, ī, and ay (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §1210–1212). But for the plural, the conditioning is different and only
i triggers vowel harmony.39Thus, one gets: bi-hī/bi-him, fī-hi/ fī-hum and ʕalay-
hi/ʕalay-hum (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1120). This pattern is not described by the Arab
grammarians, and is specific to this Quranic reading tradition.40 It is difficult
39
Yaʕqūb’s direct teacher, Sallām ʔabū al-Munḏir (d. 171/788) conditions the harmony of the
singular in the same way as the plural, where only i but not ay and ī trigger vowel harmony
(van Putten and Sidky forthcoming).
40
In fact, it is also attested in several other non-canonical Basran reading traditions, see van
Putten & Sidky (forthcoming).

chapter 3
to envision such conditioning as a natural development. It rather seems to be
a concerted effort of the reader to have an exotic and complex harmony rule.
Ruways takes this exotic conditioning even further. Because the apocopate
of final weak verbs is envisioned in grammatical theory as shortened forms of
the long imperfect stems, that is, yaʔti is considered a shortened form of yaʔtī,
Ruways treats these forms as having a long vowel, and thus final weak apoco-
pates block vowel harmony of -hum, while other cases of final -i do not, thus
Ruways reads: bi-him, bi-ḏanbi-him but lam yaʔti-hum (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1121).
Making a morphological distinction between word-final -i that is part of an
apocopate and that which is not. The vowel harmony is clearly dependent on
Arabic grammatical theory and a model of the ‘apocopate’, and must be seen
as artificial.
3.6.4
Ḥafṣ’ Anthology of Unusual Features
Nowhere is the artifice of the Quranic reading traditions so apparent as in the
readings of Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim. Ḥafṣ’ general principles, grammar and morphology
to a large extent agree with Classical Arabic. While this classical and standard-
ized look is striking, it is even more striking that more than any other reader,
Ḥafṣ’ reading has a very specific and clearly calculated incorporation of single
lexical items that break his general rules by incorporating a feature typical of
other Quranic readings. Such features are used in determined places, usually
only once and occasionally twice in the whole of the Quran. This clearly con-
scious, and we may even say playful, use of language was already observed in
a footnote of an article by Laher (forthcoming), but it is worthwhile here to
expand on this observation and give it a full description.
3.6.4.1
Ṣilat al-hāʔ (Q25:69)
A unique feature of the reading of Ibn Kaṯīr is that he has long vowels in the
third person singular masculine pronoun -hū/-hī which are not shortened after
a heavy syllable as we find it among the other readers. While Ḥafṣfollows the
general practice of shortening of the -hū/-hī after a heavy syllable, he has a sin-
gle exception, namely in Q25:69 he reads‘ هيفin it’ not as fī-hi as he does in the
129 other occurrences of this word, but as fī-hī (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1212).
3.6.4.2
iii-y ʔimālah (Q11:41)
Unlike the other Kufans, Ḥamzah, Xalaf and al-Kisāʔī, ʕāṣim does not regularly
have ʔimālah for iii-y verbs and nouns. Ḥafṣ, however, makes a single excep-
tion to this, namely in the word maǧrē-hā ‘its course’ in Sūrat Hūd (Q11:41) (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §1992).

3.6.4.3
Softening of Second Hamzah of Two Subsequent Hamzahs
(Q41:44)
It is typical of the Kufans and Ibn ʕāmir to not weaken the hamzah when
two vowelled hamzahs follow each other; This is different from the other
readers which lose the second hamzah, and instead create a hiatus (tashīl
al-hamzah). Hence, Ḥamzah, al-Kisāʔī, Xalaf, ʕāṣim and Ibn ʕāmir all read
Q2:6 ʔa-ʔanḏartahum ‘do you warn them?’, where the other readers read ʔa-
anḏartahum, ʔā-anḏartahum or even ʔānḏartahum (Warš) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī
§1384–1387). However, Ḥafṣ, unlike the other Kufans, makes a single exception:
he reads Q41:44 as ʔa-aʕǧamiyyun with hiatus (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1394).
3.6.4.4
Muttum instead of Mittum (Q3:157, 158)
There is disagreement among the readers on how the verb māta ‘to die’ should
be treated in the short stem of the suffix conjugation. Ibn Kaṯīr, ʔabū ʕamr,
Ibn ʕāmir and Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim all read it with a ḍammah, that is muttum,
muttu, mutnā whenever they occur; On the other hand, Ḥamzah, al-Kisāʔī, and
Nāfiʕ read it as mittum, mittu and mitnā whenever they occur. Ḥafṣgenerally
follows the i-norm, but in the two attestations in Sūrat ʔāl ʕimrān (Q3:157, 158),
he chooses to use the u-norm instead muttum instead (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2881).
3.6.4.5
Unharmonized -hu (Q18:63; Q48:10)
All canonical readers are in agreement that after i, ī and ay the third person
masculine pronoun should undergo vowel harmony and be reflected as -hi (or
-hī for Ibn Kaṯīr). While Ḥafṣusually just applies vowel harmony as expected,
he has two exceptions, one after ī and one after ay: mā ʔansā-nī-hu ‘he did
not make me forget it’ (Q18:63) and ʕalay-hu ‘upon it’ (Q48:10) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§1212).41
3.6.4.6
iii-y/w Apocopates/Imperatives Followed by the 3sg.m. Pronoun
As we will see in §7.1.8, there is disagreement between the readers on how to
treat the vocalization of the 3sg.m. clitic pronoun when it follows an apoco-
pate or imperative of a iii-y/w verb. Ḥafṣas a general rule follows the Classical
Arabic rule, which simply uses the long pronouns -hī after -i and -hū after -a,
e.g. yuʔaddi-hī ‘he returns it’ (Q3:75), lam yara-hū ‘he did not see it’ (Q90:7).
Other readers either have shortened pronouns -hu/-hi, or have a fully unvo-
calized pronominal form -h. Ḥafṣhowever has occasional exceptions to this
41
A few other readers have a similar lack of harmony in a few cases. Ḥamzah reads li-ʔahli-
hu mkuṯū (Q20:10; Q28:29) and in the transmission of al-ʔaṣbahānī for Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ we
find bi-hu nẓur (Q6:46) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1232).

general rule, instead following the practices of other readers. So, he reads fa-
ʔalqi-h ‘so deliver it!’ (Q27:28), ʔarǧi-h ‘postpone him’ (Q7:111; Q26:36) without
a final vowel (typical of ʔabū Ǧaʕfar, ʔabū ʕamr, Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim), yarḍa-hu
‘he likes it’ (Q39:7) with a short vowel (typical of Qālūn ʕan Nāfiʕ and Yaʕqūb).
Moreover, he uniquely reads yattaq-hi ‘he fears him’ (Q24:52) with dropping of
the apocopate vowel, and a following pronoun still harmonized as if the pre-
ceding vowel was present. None of the canonical reading traditions show that
behaviour, and it is irregular in his reading as well (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1217).
3.6.4.7
Conclusion
These features listed above are isolated in the transmission of Ḥafṣ, and they
are moreover unique among the transmitters of ʕāṣim. Neither Šuʕbah nor
the extensively described non-canonical transmitter al-Mufaḍḍal have such a
wide collection of ‘one-off’ exceptions to their general rules. It therefore seems
that these isolated readings by Ḥafṣare innovations introduced by him, and
shouldprobablybeconsideredconscious‘homages’tootherreadingsthatwere
around in his lifetime, showing off not only his knowledge of grammar but also
the knowledge of linguistic variation present in the Quranic reading traditions.
3.6.5
Plural Pronouns of Warš
Sībawayh (iv, 191) and al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 33), and with them many other gram-
marians (see van Putten and Sidky forthcoming) are in agreement that the
plural masculine pronouns such as hum, ʾantum, -tum, -hum, -kum may option-
ally be followed by a long vowel -ū.42 Both grammarians present this as this
basically being a free option, and in poetry we indeed find both forms used
within the same text, as the meter requires it. Some of the canonical readers
regularlyhavetheselengthenedforms.Thisappearstohavebeentypicalforthe
reading traditions of the Hijaz. Both ʔabū Ǧaʕfar and Ibn Kaṯīr use it regularly
(see Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1122). For Nāfiʕ, Ibn Muǧāhid (108f.) reports that Qālūn
(and along with him, now non-canonical transmitters such as ʔismāʕīl b. Ǧaʕ-
far, Ibn Ǧammāz and al-Musayyabī) all optionally pronounced it either in the
short or long form. ʔaḥmad b. Qālūn ←Qālūn said “Nāfiʕ used to find no fault in

An outstanding question is how these long pronominal forms should be understood in
lightof comparativeSemiticevidence.WhilemostSemiticlanguageshavetheshortforms
of these pronouns, Ancient South Arabian generally attests long forms (but occasionally
short forms are attested), as does Gəʕəz and Akkadian. The situation reported for Classi-
cal Arabic, which seems to have both forms, is not detailed enough to recover how these
forms relate to one another.

adding the vowel to the mīm.” From which Ibn Muǧāhid concludes that Nāfiʕ’s
original reading was without the vowel, and he reports that he himself reads in
this way.
Warš, however, uses both the long and short forms of the pronominal suf-
fixes, and these are phonetically conditioned: Whenever a ʔ immediately fol-
lows, Warš uses the long forms (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1123; Ibn Muǧāhid 108f.). While
this conditioning is purely phonetic it is not altogether easy to recover what
exactly would have caused this. Even if we assume that the Proto-Arabic form
was *-humu etc. there is nothing about a ʔ in the following word that would
cause it to be lengthened, nor is its absence an obvious reason for syncopa-
tion. It seems rather that Warš made the explicit choice to incorporate both
options condoned by Nāfiʕ and constructed this condition in order to be able
to accommodate both options in a single recitation, where, when reciting in
the transmission of Qālūn, one chooses either for the long or the short forms
of the pronouns.
Adistincteuphonicmotivationof thischoicebyWaršmustcertainlybecon-
sidered.43 Warš’ recitation is well-known for its excessive use of overlong vow-
els. Overlong vowels (madd) in Tajwīd are applied by all readers to long vow-
els that precede hamzah and shaddah (samāāʔu, aḍ-ḍāāllīna) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī
§1234–1238). Warš, together with Ḥamzah, is said to have had the longest over-
long vowels (al-Dānī Taysīr, 30). Unlike all other readers, Warš also lengthens
long vowels if they are preceded by hamzah, thus yielding ʔāādamu (versus the
rest ʔādamu) (al-Dānī Taysīr, 31), and even to diphthongs followed by hamzah,
e.g. šayyyyʔun and sawwwwʔata (al-Dānī taysīr, 72). Moreover, unlike some
otherreaders(IbnKaṯīr,Qālūn(withdisagreement)andas-Sūsīdonotdothis),
Warš would also lengthen long vowels if the hamzah is the beginning of the
next word, thus māā ʔunzila. All of these features give the recitation of Warš a
very distinct stretched out sound compared to all other readers. Due to Warš’
application of overlong vowels if the next word starts with a hamzah, Warš’
specific conditioning of the long pronouns to only appear before hamzah gives
him yet another opportunity to apply his signature madd.
Therefore, Warš seems to have adapted available linguistic options but has
reconfigured them in a way that seems to have been unique to Quranic recita-
tion. While descriptions of the reading traditions use the same terminology
and categories as the grammarians, the phonological and morphological phe-
nomena that are found go far beyond what we find in the descriptions of the
grammarians. Therefore, if we are to accept that the Quranic readings really

did form subsystems of the ʕarabiyyah, it was either not considered eloquent
enough to be considered ʕarabiyyah by the grammarians, or the grammarians
were woefully incomplete. Considering both the high regard for these readings
and the breadth of knowledge displayed by the earlier grammarians, neither
scenario should be considered particularly plausible.
This is an important point: while the descriptions of the reading traditions
use the same terminology and categories as the grammarians, and are able to
describe the variation found in the readings within this framework, at no point

may have had the same system as these readings. Similarly, grammarians never
describe such patterns of pronominal use as found in, for example, the reading
of Warš as acceptable (or unacceptable) for the ʕarabiyyah. This system stands
on its own, separatefrom the grammaticaltheory of Arabic, goingbeyondwhat
is considered the “regular” ʕarabiyyah that the grammarians would comment
upon.
3.6.6
Features Dependent on the Structure of the Text
Besides the features discussed above that mix and match phonological and
morphological features in clearly artificial ways from a historical linguistic
point of view, there are several cases where the reading traditions specifically
rely on the structure of the text, which seems to be designed to show off the
in-depth knowledge of this text.
3.6.6.1
ʔabū ʕamr’s Phonemic Contrast of Ā and Ǟ
ʔabū ʕamr’s ʔimālah of iii-y verbs and nouns is another clear example of the
Quranic readings not being interpretable as the outcome of natural language
change, as it is dependent on which position in the verse a word occurs. While
ʔabū ʕamr usually merges the ʔalif maqṣūrahs of iii-y versus iii-w stems and
etymological*ā(whereasotherreaderssuchasal-Kisāʔī,ḤamzahandWaršʕan
Nāfiʕ always keep them distinct), he keeps them distinct exclusively in verse-
finalposition—whichbyextensionaccommodatestherhymeof severalSūrahs
thatrhymeinQuranicArabic/-ē/,forexample,prominentlyQ20,Q53,andQ91.
Whenever a iii-y verb or noun occurs at the end of a verse, it is pronounced
with ǟ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1986).44
It is not uncommon for specific sound changes to take place only in pausal
position. This is even fairly common among the modern Arabic dialects. For

There are also transmitters of al-ʔazraq ←Warš ←Nāfiʕ that only uses ǟ in verse final posi-
tion, and not elsewhere (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2017, §2022–2023).

example, we find palatalization of *t in Shammari (van Putten 2017b), glot-
talization in Sanaani (Watson and Heselwood 2016) and vowel lengthening in
Levantine dialects (Fischer and Jastrow 1980, 179) all taking place specifically
in pause. However, in the case of ʔabū ʕamr’s reading we are not dealing with a
soundchangethattakesplaceinthisposition,butrathertheabsenceof merger
in this position, while the two sounds merge in other positions.45
Alackof amergerof aphonemiccontrastinpause,whilethemergerisfound
in all other positions is rare cross-linguistically. The only other parallel that
comestomind,wherehoweverithasbecomeapartof morphology,ratherthan
a phonemic contrast that is retained, is found in another reading tradition of a
holy text, namely that of Biblical Hebrew.There, stressed short vowels in pause
get lengthened to long vowels. This lengthening precedes certain later stress
shifts that took place, and therefore historical vowels that are lost elsewhere
showupaslongvowelsinpause(Suchard2019,115ff.).However,inHebrewsuch
pause-conditioned variants have mostly morphologized and do not generally
revive phonemic contrasts lost everywhere else.46 Suchard (2019, 115) expresses
doubt that this kind of contrast could have been obtained in natural speech
where such contrasts would have quickly been leveled by analogy. I agree with
thisassessment,andbyextensionitisparticularlydifficulttoimaginethatʔabū
ʕamr’sresultsfromnaturallanguageuse,asheretainsaphonemiccontrastonly
in rhyme position, and nowhere else.
Even if the reciter chooses to not pause at the end of the verse, the contrast
needs to be maintained, and pausing on non-verse final recommended pauses
of iii-y nouns or verbs does not cause them to be read with ǟ. The phonemic
distinction introduced by ʔabū ʕamr, then, is specifically conditioned by the
structureof thetext,makingadistinctionbetweenverse-finalpausesandother
types of pauses. This should probably be understood as a conscious awareness
of ʔabū ʕamr (or perhaps his main transmitter al-Yazīdī) to harmonize the clear
endrhymein/ē/of someof theSūrahs(vanPutten2017a,57f.),whileotherwise
maintaining a preference for merging the two sounds into a single ā—perhaps
45
There are in fact a few other positions where ʔabū ʕamr retains the contrast. Namely in
the case of feminine nouns with the shape Ca/i/uCCǟ, and whenever the consonant pre-
ceding it is r, in which case it is pronounced as ē (see Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1986, §2032). These
too can hardly be considered regular outcomes of sound change, and present situations
beyond what the grammarians discuss.
46
The occasional distinction between *CaCC- and *CiCC- nouns that have merged in non-
pausal independent position being the only clear example of an ancient phonemic con-
trast occasionally resurfacing, e.g. kɛsɛp̄ ‘silver’ in pause kåsɛp̄ (< *kasp-), but ṣɛdɛq ‘righ-
teousness’ in pause ṣɛdɛq (< *ṣidq-). But these too often gets levelled out, thus rɛḡɛl ‘leg’, is
råḡɛl in pause, despite coming from *rigl- not **ragl-.

anticipating the trend that has led to the now standard form of Classical Arabic
which does not have a distinction between these vowels.
3.6.6.2
The Verse-Penultimate Conditioning of Qutaybah and Nuṣayr ʕan
al-Kisāʔī
Two transmitters of al-Kisāʔī that do not make it into the two-rāwī canon but
are nevertheless described in quite some detail in more extensive works like al-
Dānī’s Ǧāmiʕ al-Bayān and Ibn Mihrān’s al-Ġāyah and al-Mabsūṭare Qutaybah
andNuṣayr(IbnMihrānĠāyah,141f.;al-Mabsūṭ,89).Bothof thesetransmitters,
unlike the canonical transmitters of al-Kisāʔī, make use of the long forms of the
plural pronouns. There are some minor differences, especially in the precision
of the description, between al-Dānī’s Ǧāmiʕ and Ibn Mihrān’s works. I will limit
myself to the description of al-Dānī (Ǧāmiʕ, 160ff.).
For Nuṣayr, the plural pronoun is eligible for the use of long pronouns:
A.
If it is unharmonized, i.e. -hum does not follow -i-, -ī- or -ay-. Non harmo-
nizing pronouns like -kum are therefore not affected by this condition.
B.
If the word it is attached to consists of five letters or fewer as written in
the Muṣḥaf (but he did not count wa- and ʔa- as part of the word for
this count).The independent pronouns ʾantum and hum are of course not
affected by this condition.
If these two conditions apply, then Nuṣayr uses the long pronouns:
1.
If a word beginning with an m directly follows (e.g. wa-min-humū man
yaqūl, Q9:49 but not wuǧūhu-hum muswaddah, Q39:60 becauseوجوههم
is six letters).
2.
If a word beginning with a hamzah directly follows (e.g. wa-ʾiḏā qǖla la-
humū ʾanfiqū, Q36:47 but not wa-ʾa-ʾanḏarta-hum ʾam lam, Q2:6 because
وانذرتهمis 6 or 7 letters).
3.
Itisdirectlyfollowedbythelastwordof theAya(e.g. wa-bi-l-ʾāxiratihumū
yūqinūn#, Q2:4 but not razaqnā-hum yunfiqūn#, Q2:3 becauseرزقنهمis six
letters)
For the last of these three conditions an intervening one letter word such as
wa-, bi- or fa- is not considered an intervening word, thus one reads fa-kubkibū
fīhā humū wa-l-ġāwūn# (Q26:94).
While Qutaybah’s treatment is similar, it is less complex. Condition A ap-
plies, but B does not. And only conditions 2 and 3 apply, but 1 does not. More-
over, no short words may intervene in the last word of the verse and the pro-
noun (e.g. mimmā razaqnā-humū yunfiqūn#, Q2:3 but fa-kubkibū fīhā hum
wa-l-ġāwūn#, Q26:94).
These two practices of transmission require and showcase intimate knowl-
edge of the text, and a condition which would be impossible to achieve in any

93
form of natural language. So, for example, verses 5 and 6 of Q107 are read:
(a)llaḏīna hum ʕan ṣalāti-him sāhūn(a) # (a)llaḏīna humū yurāʕūn(a) #. And
for example Q40:16 yawma hum bārizūn(a) is not read with a long pronoun
because bārizūn(a) is only the end of the verse in the Damascene verse count
and not in the Kufan verse count (Spitaler 1935, 56).
3.7
The Choices of the Canonical Readers
With the large amount of variation found in the readings, many variations of
which are difficult to understand as the result of natural language change, one
comes to wonder what the reasons for this mixed status would be. It might be
tempting to see, for example, Ḥafṣ’ reading of unharmonized -hu in ʔansānī-hu
andʕalay-huḷḷāh(§3.6.4.5)ascomingfromareportthatsaid“Ḥafṣwouldrecite
words such as ʔansānī-hu and ʕalay-hu ḷḷāh with -hu instead of -hi”, and in an
overzealous attempt to apply the rule as accurately as possible, the transmitter
would have applied it to only the words mentioned, rather than generalize it to
its full implication as was intended by our hypothetical report.47
However, in most cases I am disinclined towards an interpretation of faulty
or incomplete transmission to be the reason for the irregularities that we find
to have taken place between the period of the canonical readers and when the
readings were first described in detail, as it seems that the transmission from
the canonical readers up until Ibn Muǧāhid is quite accurate. This can be con-
firmed independently for several of the readers. While before Ibn Muǧāhid we
have no extant complete transmissions of the canonical readings, we do have
early reports of these readings in works not primarily concerned with the read-
ing traditions.
Al-Farrāʔ (d. 209ah), a direct student of al-Kisāʔī (d. 189ah), and thus also
a younger contemporary of Šuʕbah (d. 194ah) and a generation removed from
Ḥamzah (d. 156ah) often reports on the readings of these three reciters (in the
case of Šuʕbah invariably just referred to as the reading of ʕāṣim (d. 127ah))
in his Maʕānī al-Qurʔān and Luġāt al-Qurʔān. His reports in these works are
47
Rabin (1951, 99, §f) seems to have understood a report in the generalized sense rather than
the specific, as he claims that Ḥafṣread without vowel harmony fairly consistently. Some-
thing not claimed in the classical literature, to my knowledge. While I have been unable
to consult the edition of hamʕ al-hawāmiʕ fī šarḥjamʕ al-jawāmiʕ that he references, the
onlyattestationof Ḥafṣinthisbookindeeddiscusseshislackof harmonybutcertainlynot
as a general rule, but simply the two known places only as discussed in §3.6.4.5. (al-Suyūṭī

ʔisnāds of Warš from different medieval authors
almost always in line with what Ibn Muǧāhid reports, while none of his ʔis-
nāds to these readers go through al-Farrāʔ. This lends significant credibility
to the accuracy of the transmission. Likewise, Ibn Muǧāhid and later authors
like al-Dānī, Ibn Ġalbūn or Ibn al-Ǧazarī frequently have independent paths to
the transmitters without this resulting in massive disagreement among these
works.48
In some cases, we can pinpoint an innovation with accuracy, such as Warš’
lengthening of the plural pronouns exclusively before words with a hamzah
(§3.6.5). Examining the ʔisnāds of Ibn Muǧāhid (89, 91), Ibn Ġalbūn (al-taḏ-
kirah, 18f.) and al-Dānī (al-taysīr, 11) we see that the three authors have fairly
independent transmissions back to Warš, and all invariably report this same
conditioning. This leaves little doubt that indeed Warš was the innovator of
this system, and not someone further down his transmission path.
In other cases, it is not always possible to be certain whether a transmitter
innovated or not. For example, Ḥafṣreads the word raʔūf with a long vowel
whenever it occurs, whereas Šuʕbah reads raʔuf. Both transmitters trace their
reading back to ʕāṣim, so how do we decide which reading ʕāṣim actually read?
We might rely on outside factors, such as the fact that all other Kufans also read
48
The overall soundness of transmission of the readings is affirmed, although not exactly
demonstrated, by Nasser (2013b, 136) as well.

raʔuf to consider Ḥafṣ’ reading to be the innovative one, while Šuʕbah’s is the
original as it is more typically Kufan. But it is fairly easy to turn that argument
on its head: one could argue that Šuʕbah’s reading was influenced by the other
Kufans around him, whereas Ḥafṣretained the original reading.49
Modern Muslim orthodoxy tries to reconcile cases where the transmitters
disagreebyassertingthattheeponymousreadermusthavetaughtbothoptions
(As-Said 1975, 91–93). While this is often just used as a convenient excuse for
resolving the issue of conflicting readings, there is of course no reason to think
that an eponymous reader did not, indeed read certain words in different ways
on different occasions or changed their mind during their career as teacher.
Whatever is the case, specific variants can only seldomly be rationalized as the
result of faulty transmission.
When we turn to the eponymous readers themselves, we quickly lose the
ability to gain insight into the development of different options. In some cases,
eponymous readers stand in a teacher-student relationship such as ʔabū Jaʕfar
→Nāfiʕ; Ibn Kaṯīr →ʔabū ʕamr; and Ḥamzah →al-Kisāʔī; Ḥamzah →Sulaym
b. ʕīsā →Xalaf. These relationships help us understand similarities between
the readers; all these teacher-student relations show up as obvious similarities
of specific word choices when we compare their readings (see Sidky forth-
coming; Melchert 2008). However, it is difficult to recover any reason for the
differences they have in their linguistic systems. Why, for example, do al-Kisāʔī
and Xalaf simply apply vowel harmony to ʕalay-him, ʔilay-him and laday-him,
unlike Ḥamzah? Why did their teacher choose to not apply harmony in only
those three words?
All of these readers had more teachers than just the canonical readers, and
some of the variation and irregularity is probably to be attributed to this fact.
Presented with multiple teachers, each teaching different options, a reader
was tasked with deciding themselves which form they considered to be the
most correct and most eloquent. Such choices would probably not always have
been made through purely linguistic reasoning, but the exact methods through
which this happened are mostly unrecoverable.
One might envision, for example, the case of Ḥamzah’s unique i-umlaut
ʔimālah of ḍiʕēfan, that one of the teachers of Ḥamzah transmitted to him a
report that the prophet used to recite “wa-l-yaxša llaḏīna law takrahū min xalfi-
him ḏuriyyatan ḍiʕēfan xēfū ʕalayhum fa-l-yattaqù ḷḷāha wa-l-yaqūlū qawlan

This may, in fact, be made plausible by the fact that Ibn Muǧāhid brings a transmission of
al-Kisāʔī ←Šuʕbah that he did in fact read raʔūf and not raʔuf, despite al-Kisāʔī reading
raʔuf himself (Ibn Muǧāhid, 171).

sadīdan (Q4:9)” which could have been an accurate transmission of i-umlaut
or perhaps the result of the transmitter speaking with affected recitation due
to his own dialect having i-umlaut. Not wanting to misrepresent this alleged
prophetic reading, Ḥamzah would have piously inserted the i-umlaut of ḍiʕē-
fan into his own recitation, without further thinking or analysing the broader
implication of i-umlaut being present in this word out of conservatism. While
suchahypotheticalscenarioisnotnecessarilyunrealistic,itdoesnotseempos-
sible to recover why a reciter chose the forms he chose, and what other options
he had access to.
One interesting and rare case where the tradition gives us a direct piece of
insightintotheselectionprocedureof readingsisfoundwithNāfiʕ.Hismethod
of constructing his reading is reported by Ibn Muǧāhid (61f.), who says that
Nāfiʕ said: “I looked to what two among them [his teachers] agreed upon, and
I adopted it [in reading], and if any was alone [in reading a certain word], I
removed it, until I had constructed this reading made up of these aspects.”50
Such a method as laid out by Nāfiʕ makes sense of the mixed linguistic nature
of this reading, even if the teachers that he drew his data from all had fully reg-
ular and natural readings—which they likely did not, as they themselves may
have had similar methods of constructing their reading.
From the very earliest transmissions of the reading traditions, we find that
they already contain a collection of different dialectal features. Some of these
features can be considered clear and conscious innovations, but many of them
arelikelytheresultof asimilar‘construction’of differentfeaturesastheparam-
eters of the eloquent ʕarabiyyah were being negotiated by different readers.
The mixed character did not come about through faulty transmission in be-
tween the time that the readers were active and when the readings were can-
onized. This mixed form seems quite reliably attributable to the eponymous
readers that they are said to represent. As can be seen from Nāfiʕ’s reported
methodof constructinghisreading,theprimaryconcernof thecanonicalread-
ers was not to transmit a consistent linguistic system, but rather to construct
a reading containing eloquent features by whatever standard they considered
it to be eloquent. A standard which, more often than not, was probably not a
linguistically motivated one.

classical arabic and the reading traditions
97
3.8
Conclusion
In this chapter we have examined the language of the Quranic reading tradi-
tions. While it is often accepted as a truism that the language of the Quran is
Classical Arabic, actually examining this statement reveals subtleties that can-
notbeglossedoverif wewanttoexaminewhatthelanguageof theQuranreally
is. Looking at the language of the reading traditions it is clear that the answer is
not so simple. The tradition presents us with 20 different answers to what the
language of the Quran really is.
Second, looking closer, we find that none of these readings represent any-
thing like natural language, or in fact any kind of language described by the
Arab grammarians. Regular sound changes that are described in great detail by
theArabgrammariansfailtoapplywithanyconsistencyintheQuranicreading
traditions. As such, none of the readings can be considered ‘dialects of Arabic’,
nor in fact any form of natural language.
While the reasons for these irregularities are not always recoverable, it is
clearthattheartificialnatureof thereadingsisnotjusttheresultof incomplete
or faulty transmission of the ‘true’ language of the Quran.The readings in many
cases embrace artificial features for a certain artistic effect, which suggests a
conscious attempt of the readers to beautify their recitation with unusual and
exotic features.
Nöldeke (1910, 2) already remarked on this well over a century ago, he feels
that one can still recover the true language below this, saying that “among
these reading traditions there are certain things that were more or less alien
to living language. The oriental has the tendency to artificially ornament the
solemn recitation of their holy texts; […] But the real language shines through
everywhere.”51 I believe that Nöldeke’s confidence that the real language shines
through everywhere is not borne out by the evidence. Due to these artificial
features, it is not altogether obvious that we can recover the “language of the
Quran” through reflection on the Quranic reading traditions. None of them
form a consistent system (as also noted by Nöldeke et al. 2013, 543), and it is
unclear which layers of artifice and irregularity one should remove to get to the
“true” language of the Quran, and which ones to keep. The early grammarians
like Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ, active around the same period as the early trans-
mitters of the readers, likewise fail to give a unified answer to what this “real

of the “artificial ornaments” would yield—provided we could confidently iden-
tifyallof them—cannotsimplybefilledwithaunifiedanswercomingfromthe
data of the grammarians.
Moreover, even if it would be somehow possible to filter out from the mate-
rial of the grammarians which parts of their description represents Nöldeke’s
“real language”, we would still have to accept that the grammarians’ conception
of this “real language”—living more than 150 years after the rise of Islam—
would be an accurate representation of what the “real language” was felt to be
at the time of composition. I do not believe that this is convincingly demon-
strated by anyone.
What is clear, however, is that contrary to the common conception that the
ʕarabiyyah is based on eastern dialects, whenever the readers agree on a fea-
ture, they primarily converge upon forms that are said to be Hijazi by the Arab
grammarians. If anything is to be gained from the readings to inform us about
what language the Quran represents, the answer would seem to be that at its
core there seems to be traces of a Hijazi dialect, and that this is what shines
through if we were to remove Nöldeke’s “artificial ornaments”.
It seems that the reading traditions cannot give us a more accurate under-
standingof whatthelanguageof theQuranwouldbe,astheyareclearlynottry-
ing to accurately represent its original language. The only aspect of the Quran
that can certainly be projected back to the very beginning of the Islamic period
with little to no change is the Quranic Consonantal Text. This therefore func-
tionsastheonlydirectsourceof thelanguageof theQuran.Theqctasasource

4.1
Introduction
In the previous section we have shown that when looking to answer the ques-
tion what the language of the Quran is, the reading traditions fail to give a
consistent answer. They are linguistically diverse, none of them look like natu-
ral language, and they must be considered to be a concerted effort to beautify
the recitation of the Quran through the use of exotic linguistic features from a
variety of different dialects, augmented with completely innovative forms that
do not seem to have been part of anyone’s natural speech. These reading tradi-
tions take shape with the eponymous readers, and it is difficult to see further
back than these readers through internal reflection.
However, there is a source of the Quran that carries linguistic information
that does go back to the very first decades of Islam: the written text itself. In
recent years it has become clear that virtually every early Quranic manuscript
that we have access to today goes back to a single archetypal copy (Cook 2004;
Sinai 2014a; 2014b; van Putten 2019c). The dating of these manuscripts is so
early that a date much later than the date attributed to it by the Islamic tradi-
tion (that is, during the reign of ʕuṯmān b. ʕaffān, 644–656ce) is quite difficult
to envision. This primary source, while written in a highly defective script still
carriesalotof linguisticinformationthatwecanlikewisedatebacktothisearly
period: the spelling is not random, but forms a clear system. This orthography
must be seen as an important source of linguistic data, and its frequent devia-
tions from the later standard Classical Arabic orthography can give us impor-
tant insights into the nature of the language and how it differs from Classical
Arabic. Moreover, as the Quran is a rhymed text, we receive a unique insight
into some phonological features of the language which are not easily recover-
able from other texts from this period, such as the early Islamic papyri.

chapter 4
In a series of papers, I have already explored what the qct can tell us about
the phonology and nominal morphology of Quranic Arabic (van Putten forth-
coming;2017a;2017b;2018;2019b;vanPuttenandStokes2018).Whathasnotyet
beenexplored,however,isthehistoricallinguisticaffiliationof QuranicArabic.
What morphological and phonological isoglosses does Quranic Arabic have?
Andhowdoesitrelatetopre-IslamicArabicvarietiesasfoundintheepigraphic
record and dialects as reported by the Arab grammarians?
Throughout modern Arabist literature, we find many statements that sug-
gest that the Quran was written in a kind of mixed dialect, drawing freely
from different dialects—much in the way as the Arabic poetry. The idea that
the Quran was written in a mixed dialect seems to ultimately originate from
the medieval Islamic tradition, but received its modern articulation in Chaim
Rabin’s monumental work on the Ancient West Arabian dialects where he
statedwithsomeconfidencethattheQuranwascomposedinthe‘poetickoine’
(Rabin 1951, 3f.).1 Rabin admits that the form of the poetic koiné used in the
Hijaz may have had a local pronunciation, primarily, having lost the glottal
stop as reflected in the orthography (Rabin 1951, 4f.). However he tells us that
“in morphology, on the other hand, an almost complete conformity with the
‘Arabiyya’ could be achieved” (Rabin 1951, 4). The claim then, is that morpho-
logically we should be able to see that the text of the Quran adheres to the
‘Classical Arabic’ speech norms as opposed to the local dialect of the Hijaz.
This chapter will examine the morphological features of Quranic Arabic as
reflectedintheqct,whilethenextchapterwilltackleitsphonologicalfeatures.
These features will be compared against the reports of the Arab grammarians
as well as the linguistic data found in epigraphic pre-Islamic Arabic. From this
discussion it will become clear that whenever the qct allows us to identify lin-
guistic features it almost universally agrees with what the Arab grammarians
attributed to the dialect of the Hijaz, and as such Quranic Arabic should be
understood as a reflex of a Hijazi Arabic vernacular and not “Classical Arabic”.
Moreover, frequently we will see that a large amount of the relevant isoglosses
visible in the epigraphic record clearly point away from a northern origin, and
on occasion give clear evidence that the isoglosses present in the qct are an
innovation typical for Hijazi Arabic.
In Al-Jallad’s (2020b) revolutionary work on the Damascus Psalm fragment,
he already listed several morphological features which appear to form unique
Hijazi innovations in comparison to forms of Old Arabic found in Northern
1 Rabin (1955, 24) credits Fleisch (1947, 97–101), and Blachère (1947, 159–169) for coming to this
conclusion independently from him that the Quran was composed in the poetic koiné. Nei-
ther author is much more informative as to what this elusive poetic koiné entails.

varieties such as Safaitic, Hismaic and Nabataean Arabic. These isoglosses
occur in Quranic Arabic as well, and as such, the language of the Damas-
cus Psalm fragment and the Quranic Arabic are closely related to each other.
Some of the isoglosses that can be identified as Hijazi innovations from the
epigraphic record are also identified as typically Hijazi isoglosses by the Arab
grammarians, and there are yet other isoglosses identified by the Arab gram-
marians for which not as much evidence has been found in the epigraphic
record yet. In the following section we will look at morphological isoglosses
present in Quranic Arabic as can be gleaned from the qct which can either
be compared to the epigraphic record, or those reported by Sībawayh and al-
Farrāʔ (or both). Whenever relevant, I will also cite the discussion of isoglosses
that are discussed by Rabin (1951).
4.2
The ʔalla- Base Relative Pronoun
Quranic Arabic forms its relative pronoun on a base ʔalla- followed by deictic
elements ʔalla-ḏī, ʔalla-tī, ʔalla-ḏīn etc. This form is innovative in relation to
the ancient Semitic relative pronoun ḏū, a relative pronoun which continued
to exist in Quranic Arabic with a more restricted possessive meaning ‘possessor
of …’,e.g.ذوافضل
/ḏūfaḍl/‘possessorof favour’.Thisinnovationisalsoacknowl-
edged by Rabin (1951, 154).
Theḏ-baserelativepronounistheonethatshouldlikelybereconstructedfor
Proto-Semitic and is cognate to the Aramaic relative pronoun, e.g. Nabataean
Aramaicדי/זי
(Cantineau 1978, 61), Biblical Aramaic( י ִדּRosenthal 1961, 21f.) and
Gəʕəz zä. It is the relative pronoun found in the Northern epigraphic varieties
of Old Arabic: Safaitic (m. ḏ, f.sg. ḏʾt, ḏt, ḏ(?) pl. ḏw, see Al-Jallad 2015, 85–88),
and the one that seems to be attested in the Nabataean Arabic of the Namārah
inscription:דו אשר אלתג
/ḏū ʔasara al-tāg/ ‘who bound the crown’, (Rabin 1951,
205; Cantineau 1978, 49), cf. also the theonymדושרא
/ḏū śarā/ ‘the one of the
Sharā mountain’ (Cantineau 1978, 80).
The earliest attestation of the ʔalla-base relative pronoun seems to be JSLih
384, an Old Arabic inscription in the Northern Hijaz, in the Dadanitic script,
which has the feminine relative pronoun spelled ʾlt, presumably to be read /ʔal-
latī/. See Müller (1982) and Macdonald (2000, 49) who identify the use of the
ʔalla-base in this inscription as an Arabic isogloss, and see Al-Jallad (2015, 13,
n. 17; 2018b, 8f.; 2020b, 60) who identifies it as a specifically Old Hijazi isogloss
within Arabic.
While the ʔalla-base is quite clearly an innovation and seems to have its
origins in the Hijaz, by the time the grammarians start discussing the lin-

guistic variation of Arabic, it seems to have become extremely dominant.
Neither Sībawayh nor al-Farrāʔ consider any other relative pronouns.2 A few
later grammarians attribute archaic forms of the relative pronoun to Yemeni
dialects who used ḏī (Rabin 1951, 39) and the Ṭayyiʔ who used ḏū (Rabin 1951,
204f.).
4.3
The Distal Demonstrative Expansion with -l(i)- in ḏālika, tilka and
hunālika
A typical feature of Quranic Arabic is the exclusive use of the distal demonstra-
tives that have an additional element -l(i)- between the demonstrative element
and the addressee agreement suffix -ka/-kum etc. Thus, in the qct we findذلك
andتلكand never forms likeذاكḏāka andتيكtīka orتاكtāka. The latter forms
are reported for Classical Arabic (Wright 1896, §342; Fischer 2002, §275a), and
especially ḏāka occasionally occurs in poetry and Classical Arabic prose (often
co-occurring besides ḏālika).
The difference between these two pronouns is widely identified as a Hijazi
isogloss already in the time of al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 11), who recognizes the exclu-
sive use of the ḏālika form as typical for the Quran and attributes it to the Hijaz,
while the people of Najd among the Qays, ʔasad, Tamīm and Rabīʕah use ḏāka.
As far as can be gleaned from the fragmentary pre-Islamic data, it seems that
the archaic forms without the -l(i)- insertion were original to the northern Old
Arabic varieties, and that -l(i)- extension is a Hijazi innovation (Al-Jallad2020b,
61f.). tk as a feminine distal demonstrative appears to be attested in a single
Safaitic inscription (Al-Jallad 2015, 84).
While Rabin (1951, 154) recognizes the identification of the -l(i)- extension as
Hijazi, he remains skeptical of this identification because some Western Arabs
have sayings and poems attributed to them that use ḏāka as well. He is also sus-
picious of the claim because Arab grammarians that claim this to be a Hijazi
featuretendtocitetheQuranasevidenceforthis,asitexclusivelyhas-li-exten-
sion. This seems to me to be the wrong conclusion based on the facts available.
First, as ḏālika is the innovative form and ḏāka the original, the fact that an
archaic form is used by Western Arabs—assuming this attribution is valid—is
hardly an argument why ḏālika is not a Hijazi feature. At most it is an argument
2 Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 12) does talk about relative pronouns however, and attributes an inflecting
form of the plural to Huḏayl: nom. allaḏūna obl. allaḏīna.

that ḏāka is not an exclusively eastern feature. Just because ḏāka occurs in the
Hijaz as well, does not exclude the possibility that ḏālika is indeed a uniquely
Hijazi innovation.
HissecondpointseemstopresupposetheconclusionthattheQuraniscom-
posed in the poetic koine and therefore cannot be evidence of dialectal data,
but this has not been demonstrated by him, nor by anyone else. The very fact
that Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 11) feels the need to explicitly state that ḏālika is the form
that occurs in the Quran in fact highlights that this is a fact considered remark-
able and distinctive of Quranic Arabic, and something that he did not consider
to follow automatically from the statement that this is the Hijazi form.
In Classical Arabic prose and poetry alike ḏāka and ḏālika co-occur, and its
absence in the Quran is in fact striking, and a clear deviation from the Classical
Arabic norms. The very fact that al-Farrāʔ, nor any other grammarian, feels the
need to attribute all features present in Quranic readings to the Hijaz (as we
saw in chapter 3), seems to confirm that the observation on the Hijazi charac-
ter of ḏālika is quite independent from the observation that it is the only form
that occurs in the Quran.
To ḏālika and tilka, we may also add that the distal locative demonstrative
receives the -l(i)- expansion to formهنالكrather than hunāka as a Hijazi fea-
ture (al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 47). The Tamimi hunāka becomes the dominant form in
literary Arabic production but is absent in the qct.
4.4
The Plural Demonstratives (hā-)ʔulāʔi/(hā-)ʔulā; ʔulāʔika/ʔulāka
Another isogloss that is attributed to the Hijaz is the shape of the plural dis-
tal demonstrative. Here al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 12) reports ʔulāʔika for Qurayš and
the people of the Hijaz, while ʔulāka is reported for Qays, Tamīm, Rabīʕah and
ʔasad, ʔullāka for some of the Banū Saʕd and Tamīm, and ʔulālika for “some
of them”.3 The qct is unambiguous in this regard as it only attests the spelling
اوليكand neverاولاك
,and therefore it is only compatible with the Hijazi form.4
The proximal plural demonstrative likewise is reported by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt,
22) to have a difference between Qurayš and those that surround them who
have hāʔulāʔi as opposed to Tamīm, Qays, Bakr and the common people of
3 From the context it is unclear whether Al-Farrāʔ intends “some of the Banū Saʕd and Tamīm”
or “some of the Arabs”. Considering that the -l(i)- infix is a Hijaz feature in the singular forms,
it seems probable that the latter is intended, and that it is a feature found, probably, among
some Hijazis, but this is not made explicit.
4 For this isogloss see also Rabin (1951, 153, §g).

chapter 4
ʔasad who say ʔulā (spelledأُل َىin the edition) or hā-ʔulā (spelledهَاؤُل َىin the
edition) with an ʔalif maqṣūrah (as opposed to an ʔalif mamdūdah). He adds
that ‘some Arabs’ drop the first ʔalif of the word and say hawlāʔi and cites a
piece of poetry that adduces this.5
The qct does not allow us to infer with certainty the shape of the proxi-
mal deictic (although it definitely has the initial hā-), as both ʔalif and yāʔ can
represent the ʔalif maqṣūrah whereas ʔalif can also represent ʔalif mamdūdah.
Thus, the qctهولاis consistent both with hāʔulāʔi and hāʔulā.
However, al-Farrāʔ explicitly writes the ʔalif maqṣūrah with a yāʔ, which
means he likely intended the Najdi pronunciation to have been (hā)ʔulē, since
the Kufans, including his teacher al-Kisāʔī, would regularly read ʔalif maq-
ṣūrah bi-sūrat al-yāʔ with ʔimālah (see §3.6.4.2).6 Since the qct distinguishes
between /ē/ (spelled with yāʔ) and /ā/ (spelled with ʔalif ) the qct would only
be consistent with hāʔulāʔi and not with hāʔulē.
4.5
Proximal Deictics with Mandatory hā- Prefix
In the qct all proximal deictics, be they masculineهذا
,feminineهذه
,plural
هولاor locativeههناare prefixed by hā-. This is remarkably different from what
isreportedfromClassicalArabicwhereformswithouthā-arebroadlyreported,
e.g. masculine ḏā, feminine ḏih, ḏī, tī plural ʔulā locative hunā. In Classical Ara-
bic prose especially the form hunā—absent in the qct—becomes standard,
while others are rare.
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 22) reports the addition of the hā- prefix as optional for
the plural among eastern tribes, but mandatory in the Hijaz. Forms without
hā- are not explicitly mentioned for singular masculine ḏā or feminine ḏī/ḏih
by al-Farrāʔ, although later grammarians like al-Zamaxšarī (al-Mufaṣṣal, 55) do
report them. Even the locative deictic consistently has the hā- prefix in Quranic
Arabicههنا
‘here’ (Q3:154; Q5:24; Q26:146; Q69:35).
In the pre-Islamic record, we find that the Northern varieties consistently
lack the addition of the hā- so its mandatory addition appears to be a typical
5 It is interesting to note that “dropping of the ʔalif ” for al-Farrāʔ seems to mean that āʔu auto-
matically becomes aw, while one might expect it to become aʔu instead. With this single
occurrence it is difficult to decide what to make of this observation.
6 Modern mesopotamian dialects that retain a reflex of word-final ē as -i (ḥəbli) occasionally
seem to treat ʔalif mamdūdah the same way, hence šəti ‘winter’. This seems to point to a
merger of word final *-ay- and word final *-āy- towards ē before the shift of *-āy- to -āʔ- took
place, cf. Safaitic śty /śetāy/ ‘winter’. See on this topic also Levin (1992, especially 86f.).

innovation of Quranic Arabic. For example, Safaitic only attests ḏ, presumably
/ḏā/ (Al-Jallad 2015, 80), and the same is true for the late Nabataean Arabic
inscription at Harran (568ce), which clearly attestsدا المرطول
/ḏā al-marṭūl/
‘this Martyrion’ (Fiema et al. 2015, 414), a feminine deicticתיwithout the ini-
tialhā-islikewiseattestedintheNabataeanArabicof theNamārahinscription,
e.g.תי נפש
(328ce)(Fiemaetal.2015,405).Thus,whiletheepigraphicdatadoes
not allow an identification of this isogloss of typical for the Hijaz, it is clear that
North of the Hijaz the addition of the hā- was not mandatory, as no attestations
of it have been found so far.
4.6
Feminine Proximal Deictic hāḏih
According to Sībawayh (iv, 182) the Tamīm dialect has the feminine proximal
deictic hāḏī form in context which becomes hāḏih form in pause. This is also
what Rabin (1951, 152, §f) claims is the “strict Classical Arabic” form.7The Hijazi
dialect would have borrowed this pausal form from Classical Arabic. No argu-
ment is given why it would not be the other way around or how he envisions
a spoken dialect like Hijazi would go about borrowing such a basic category as
a demonstrative from a poetic register. The existence of tī/tā demonstratives
in ḥadīṯs8 and poems does not disprove that the hāḏih form was the common
form in the Hijaz—only that some archaic forms were also in use, if we would
accept that poetry and ḥadīṯs are representative of Hijazi Arabic. The feminine
proximal deictic throughout the qct isهذه
,which is in line with the report for
Hijazi Arabic, which is said to use hāḏih(ī) both in pause and context.
In the northern Old Arabic dialects evidence is found for both tī and ḏī but
not (hā-)ḏihī. For example, the ancient Namārah inscription (dated 328ce)
written in Nabataean Arabic starts withתי נפש
‘this is the funerary monument
of …’. Safaitic seems to attest a feminine demonstrative that has an initial ḏ,
presumably /ḏī/, rather than t a feminine deictic also reported by the Arab
grammarians (Al-Jallad 2015, 81). The forms with final h—the only form found
in the Quran—is currently unattested in pre-Islamic Arabic.
7 I do not understand what the category of “strict Classical Arabic” is based on. It would imply
that Sībawayh’s own prose is not a representation of ‘strict Classical Arabic’, as he exclusively
uses hāḏihī in context.
8 In fact, the prophetic narration that Rabin cites does not have the proximal deictic, but rather
the distal deictic: kayfa tī-kum ‘how is that one (spoken to a plurality of addressees)?’ As
prophetic narrations are not necessarily verbatim narrations, the use if tī-kum probably says
more about the dialect of ʕāʔišah (who narrates this tradition), or the common link of this
Hadith (which seems to be Ibn Šihāb al-Zuhrī) than it does about the prophet’s speech.

4.7
Loss of Barth-Ginsberg Alternation
As discussed in §2.2.5, Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ agree that one of the features
absent in Hijazi Arabic that is present in all other dialects is the use of i-prefixes
intheprefixconjugationof stative faʕilaverbs,thustheysayʔanāʔiʕlamuḏāka
‘I know that’ rather than the Hijazi ʔana ʔaʕlamu ḏālika.9
The Barth-Ginsberg alternation must certainly be reconstructed for Proto-
Arabic(see§2.2.5).Thus,thedisappearanceof itisaspecificinnovationtypical
of Hijazi Arabic. Indeed, there is evidence for this being a Hijazi innovation
from the epigraphic record as well:Two Graeco-Arabic inscriptions from North
Arabia attest verbs that unambiguously have i-prefixes with a stem vowel a:
ιραυ /yirʕaw/ ‘they pastured’ (Al-Jallad and al-Manaser 2015) and εσρατ /yisrat/
‘he served in the army’ (Al-Jallad et al. 2020). There is epigraphic evidence in
the Northern Hijaz of the innovative generalization if the a-prefixes, namely
in a Greek inscription which contains the name Ιαλης (UJadhGr 2) (Nehmé
2018, 286f.), identified by Ahmad Al-Jallad (personal correspondence) as rep-
resenting the Arabic verbal name /yaʕlē/, rather than the expected /yiʕlē/, had
Barth-Ginsberg been operative. Thus, the epigraphic record seems to confirm
that the lack of Barth-Ginsberg alternation is a Hijazi isogloss, in line with the
reports of the grammarians.
In the qct it is generally difficult to find unambiguous evidence for or
against the Barth-Ginsberg alternation of the prefix, because of the short vow-
els being unwritten. However, there are two types of verbs, identified by Sīb-
awayh and al-Farrāʔ alike, where this dialectal difference shows up in the con-
sonantal skeleton of the text. As they both point out, stative verbs with I-w and
I-ʔ stems, in the case of the application of Barth-Ginsberg, will end up with a
yāʔ, thus one gets tīǧalu ‘you fear’ and tiʔbā ‘you refuse’ (Sībawayh, iv, 111). In
this place, the qct provides us with evidence that Quranic Arabic follows the
Hijazi innovation of not having Barth-Ginsberg alternation, as we findلا توجل
/lā tawǧal/ ‘do not fear!’ (Q15:53) rather than **لا تيجل
,explicitly mentioned by
al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 8) to be the expected form in the non-Hijazi dialects. For the
I-ʔ stems, we find more evidence in the qct that the Barth-Ginsberg alterna-
tion did not operate:ان تامنه
/ʔin tāman-h/ ‘if you entrust him’ (Q3:75, twice),
لا تامنا
/lā tāman-nā/ ‘you do not entrust us’ (Q12:11),تالمون
/tālamūn/ ‘you are
9 For this feature, see also Rabin (1951, 158, §p, q), who suggests that this feature is borrowed
from North-West Semitic, rather than a shared retention. This seems to be the result of impo-
sition of the late Classical Arabic norms which lacks this alternation, taking this standard as
a stand-in for Proto-Arabic. There is no obvious reason to assume that the Classical Arabic
situation is original in this case.

/an yāmanū wa-yāmanū qawmahum/ ‘that they entrust you and they entrust
their people’ (Q4:91);يالمونك
/yālamūna/ ‘you are suffering’ (Q4:104).
These examples thus confirm that Quranic Arabic follows the innovative
Hijazi practice of lacking the Barth-Ginsberg alternation.
4.8
Uninflected halumma
Rabin (1951, 162f., §z)—following al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 63) and Sībawayh (iii,
529)—points out that in the Hijaz halumma ‘come on!’ was uninflected, while
the Tamīm conjugated it as an imperative verb, sg.m. halumma, sg.f. halummī,
du.halummā,pl.mhalummūpl.f.halmumna,(al-Farrāʔreportstheunexpected
feminine plural forms halummanna, halumunna). In the qct,هلمis uninflected
in the two places it occurs (Q6:150; Q33:18), which in both cases has a plural
addressee. The qct therefore agrees with the Hijaz in this regard. The Hijazi
form here is probably archaic, as it seems likely that this is a presentative par-
ticle hal10 followed by -umma, the same particle as the vocative suffix that one
finds in aḷḷāh-umma ‘O God!’ The innovation of the Tamīm would have then
been to interpret this as an imperative verb.11
4.9
Imperatives and Apocopates of ii=iii Verbs Have the Shape vCCvC
Rather Than (v)CvCC
Imperative and apocopates of geminate verbs have a metathesized form in
non-Hijazi dialects (urudd(a/u)), whereas in the Hijaz they are un-metathe-
sized (urdud) (Rabin 1951, 161f., §y). This according to Rabin (1951, 4) is one of
“the few Hijazi forms […] that appear sporadically [in the Quran]”. It should be

chapter 4
clear by now that many more Hijazi features than just the treatment of gemi-
nate verbs appear in the Quran. The claim that this form is sporadic among the
readers is not in keeping with the attestations in the Quran. The unmetathe-
sized Hijazi form is the norm. The apocopate occurs without metathesis 43
times, and the imperative 8 times. The metathesized forms never occur for
the imperative, and for the apocopate there are only three, or four cases. The
first isيشاق
‘opposes’ (Q59:4), while the unmetathesized form of the same verb
is attested asيشاقق
‘opposes’ (Q4:115). The second and third areتضار
‘suffers’
(Q2:233) andيضار
‘suffers’ (Q2:282), which do not occur in unmetathesized
forms elsewhere. The last case is a bit more involved. In the Kufan and Bas-
ran codicesيرتد
‘turns back’ (Q5:54) occurs besidesيرتدد
‘turns back’ (Q2:217)
(Al-Dānī muqniʕ, 107), but in the Syrian and Medinan codices Q5:54 is spelled
يرتدد
.12
Rabin suggests that the Hijaz used the unmetathesized forms exclusively,
while the Tamīm used the metathesized forms. This is indeed how Sībawayh
(iii, 529–532) reports it. However, al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 36) seems to accept the
possibility of metathesized forms in Hijazi dialects as he says that Hijaz and
ʔasad place the vowel a after metathesized final root consonants such as in
tuḍārra while Tamīm and Qays have tuḍārri. The isogloss therefore seems to
be that Hijazi was able to use both metathesized and unmetathesized forms
whereasTamīm used the metathesized forms exclusively.The qct overwhelm-
ingly has forms that are not metathesized, clearly showing this Hijazi isogloss.
The metathesis found in Hijazi would appear to be a reflex of a type of assim-
ilation across syllable boundaries that occasionally occurs in the qct, also in
other positions (see Appendix A.3.5 for a discussion).
4.10
Mā ḥiǧāziyyah
The vast majority of the nominal negation using mā is constructed with the
predicate marked with bi-, e.g.وما هم بمومنين
‘they are not believers’ (Q2:8). Only
on rare occasions is the bi- left out, and in those cases a disagreement is said
to occur between the people of the Hijaz and Najd. This much is also admit-
ted by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 28): “the people of the Hijaz say mā zaydun bi-qāʔim
‘Zayd is not standing’, and hardly ever do they drop the bi- from their speech,
12
It is surprising that Rabin (1951, 162) reports to not have found variants for Q5:54, as yarta-
did is the reading of the canonical Syrian and Medinan readers, Ibn ʕāmir, Nāfiʕ and ʔabū
Ǧaʕfar—in accordance with their regional rasm (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2989).

and this is how it is in the Quran except in His speech: mā hāḏā bašarā and
mā hunna ʔummahāti-him, they apply the accusative when they leave out the
bi-. Tamīm, Qays and ʔasad (also) say it with the bi-, but when they remove the
bi-, they apply the nominative.”13 This use of the accusative is usually known
as Mā Ḥiǧāziyyah, whereas using the nominative is called the MāTamīmiyyah,
thisfeatureiswell-knownamongthegrammarians(seealsoSībawayh,i,57).At
the time of writing, Rabin (1951, 174ff., §p-t) seemed to lack sources that explic-
itly comment on the frequency of this construction, and as he points out it
seems to have been quite rare. We now know that this was also recognized by
Al-Farrāʔ as well. Indeed, in the qct, only one unambiguous case of the mā
Ḥijāziyyah can be discerned, namely the famousما هذا بشرا
“this is not a man”
(Q12:31). The one other commonly cited exampleما هن امهتهم
“they are not their
mothers” (Q58:2), universally read in the Hijazi manner by the canonical read-
ers mā hunna ʔummahāti-him(ū) (not ʔummahātu-hum(ū)14) is ambiguous in
the qct, and could reflect both the mā ḥiǧāziyyah and the mā tamīmiyyah.
Rabin tentatively supplies another optionما منكم من احد عنه حجزين
“not one of you
can shield against it” (Q69:47). This one does show the Hijazi form in the qct,
but does not get commented upon by the Arab grammarians, perhaps because
they took ḥāǧizīna as a ḥāl.
As pointed out by al-Farrāʔ and Rabin, all other cases of nominal negation
withmāmarkthepredicatewithbi-.Theanomalousnatureofماهذابشرا
(Q12:31)
was the reason for Ahmad al-Jallad (2020b, 68f.) to suggest that it is a gram-
matical anomaly included as a conscious choice in the direct speech, perhaps
to give a colloquial effect to the quotation in the Quran. He likewise observes
that another grammatical anomaly, the famousان هذان لسحران
“These two are
wizards!” (Q20:63), likewise occurs in direct speech. It should be noted that,
unless there is another plausible interpretation ofما هن امهتكم
,the use of the
nominal negation with mā without bi- seems exceedingly rare, but not unique
to direct speech. With the caveat that this is admitted to be a marginal feature
in the Hijaz as well as that it is extremely marginal in the Quran, the gram-
marian data does seem to assign a Hijazi origin to the isogloss that find in the
qct.

4.11
The Morphosyntax of kāla
Al-Farrāʔ (Maʕānī, ii, 245f.) tells us that there is disagreement on the how the
verb kālū “to allot s.th. to s.o.” should be treated. He says that the people of
the Hijaz and those that neighbour Qays treat the recipient of the allotment
as a direct object, giving examples such as qad kiltu-ka ṭaʕāman kaṯīran ‘I have
allotted to you a lot of food’, and kilta-nī ‘you have allotted to me’, the more reg-
ular syntax appears to be with the preposition li-, i.e. kilta lī and kiltu laka. As
al-Farrāʔ points out himself, the qct follows the Hijazi practice in this regard
كالوهم
‘they allotted to them’ (Q83:3).
4.12
The Presentative hāʔum
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 143f.) reports a difference between the presentative particle
hāʔa ‘voilà’ and how it is inflected among the people of the Hijaz in contrast
to the people of Najd (Qays, Tamīm, ʔasad). The Najdi tribes treat this pre-
sentative particle morphologically as an imperative verb, whereas the Hijazi
dialect seems to base its endings on the 2sg. pronominal endings where the k
has been swapped out with ʔ for unclear reasons. Al-Farrāʔ also reports that
it has reached him that some Arabs indeed have kāf in place of the hamzah
giving as example hā-ka and hā-ki.

The Use of Zawǧ as ‘Wife’
One of the reported differences between Hijaz as opposed to Tamīm and many
of Qays and the people of Najd, according to al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 32–33) is that
zawǧ is a unisex word meaning both ‘husband’ and ‘wife’ depending on the
context in Hijazi whereas in the east zawǧ is ‘husband’ and zawǧah is ‘wife’.
The qct clearly aligns with the Hijazi distribution, e.g.يادم اسكن انت وزوجك
الجنه
‘O Adam, dwell, you and your wife, in Paradise’ (Q2:35).
4.14
Alternations between G- and C-stems
On multiple occasions al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt) reports that some dialects have a C-
stem where other dialects have a G-stem, with the same meaning. These are in
essence lexical isoglosses, based on what kind of morphology they follow, and
they allow us to compare them against what we see in the qct. We find that
whatever is reported to be the Hijazi form is the form that we find in the qct.
Verbs reported to have a C-stem in the Hijaz, and a G-stem elsewhere, are the
following:
– ʔawḥā ‘to inspire’ (Hijaz), waḥā (ʔasad), p. 146. qct: Hijaziاوحى
(Q99:5).
– ʔawfā ‘to fulfill’ (Hijaz), wafā ‘id.’ (Najd), p. 49. qct: Hijaziاوفى
(Q3:76) ‘he
fulfills’.
CaseswheretheHijazratherhastheG-stemwhereasothertribeshaveaC-stem

(Q29:3).
– ḥaruma ‘to be forbidden’, ḥarām pl. ḥurum ‘forbidden’ (Hijazi), ʔaḥrama ‘to

– maraǧa ‘to release’ (Hijaz), ʔamraǧa (Najd), p. 108. qct: Hijaziمرج
(Q25:53;
Q55:19).
In one case the qct seems to have both the G- and the C-stem with the same
meaning attested.
– nakira ‘to not know’ (Hijaz), ʔankara (ʔasad,Tamīm), p. 75.The qct uses the
G-stemonceنكرهم
‘hedidnotknowthem’(Q11:70),theC-stemusuallymeans
‘to reject, deny’ e.g.ينكرونها
‘they deny it’ (Q16:83), but the active participle at

‘they

These lexical isoglosses of verbal stem formation in the qct therefore seem
to follow the patterns as they are reported for the Hijazi dialect.

Morphological Isoglosses Not Recognized by the Grammarians
In Quranic Arabic, there are several morphological developments which based
on comparative evidence with modern dialects and Old Arabic must certainly
be seen as innovations typical of Quranic Arabic, yet are not recognized or dis-
cussed as isoglosses by the Arab grammarians. In these cases, whatever we find
in Quranic Arabic is identical to the ʕarabiyyah—that which the grammari-
ans describe as valid and eloquent Arabic. While these do not help us better
classify Quranic Arabic within the context of the dialects as described by the
grammarians,theyoccasionallydoallowustosetitapartfrommoderndialects
and attested forms of Old Arabic in the epigraphic record.
4.15.1
Ta-prefix in Prefix Conjugation of tD- and tL-stems
In Gəʕəz, the tD- and tL-stems the suffix conjugation has the shape tä- for the
formation prefix whereas the prefix conjugation has the shape t-, i.e. täqäṭṭälä,
yətqäṭṭäl. Classical Arabic has ta- in both forms, while most modern dialects
have t- in both stems. It was already noted by Diem (1982) that these t- forms
cannot be explained as the outcome of regular sound change from ta-, and
therefore both the ta- and t- forms must have been around in Proto-Arabic.
He subsequently suggests that Proto-Arabic probably had the distribution as
it is attested in Gəʕəz. Since Diem’s article, dialectological data has become
available that shows there are dialects that generalize the ta- like Classical Ara-
bic, and more importantly, that there are some rare dialects that indeed retain
the alternation as it is present in Gəʕəz. See for example: Douz Arabic tⁱḥaš-
šam/yitḥaššam ‘to be ashamed’, taʕāṛak/yitʕāṛak ‘to fight’ (Ritt-Benmimoun
2014, 349–350; 355–357),15 Gulf Arabic taġayyir/yitġayyar ‘to change’, tiwāfag/
yitwāfag ‘to help each other’ (Holes 2010, 404f.) and finally in Saudi Arabic we
find Ghāmid takallam/yitkallam ‘to speak’, Qauz tikallam/yitkallam ‘to speak’,
Hofuf taḥarrak/titḥarrak (3sg.f.) ‘to move’ (Prochazka 1988, 40–50). From this
evidence we must conclude that this alternation of the ta- and t- prefix can
securely be reconstructed for Proto-Arabic. The fact that this aligns with what
we find in Gəʕəz, make it clear that this allomorphy can even be reconstructed
for Proto-West Semitic.

the quranic consonantal text: morphology
113
While the evidence is sparse, the data available suggest that Quranic Arabic
underwent the same generalization as Classical Arabic. For the suffix conjuga-
tion it is clear it always has the ta- prefix, because it does not have a prothetic
ʔalif to break up the CC cluster, e.g.تقطع
‘to be severed’ (Q6:94) rather than
**اتقطعthat one would expect for **/itqaṭṭaʕ/. Evidence that the prefix was ta-
in the prefix conjugation is sparser, but it can be deduced fromيتاخر
(‘that) he
stay behind’ (Q74:37), which could only represent /yatāxxar/ or if the hamzah
is retained in this context /yataʔaxxar/. Had the prefix been t- we would have
expected **يتخرfor /yataxxar/ from *yatʔaxxara.
Thus, we can conclude that Quranic Arabic has innovated by generaliz-
ing the ta- prefix to both suffix and prefix conjugations. This generalization
seems to have become the prestigious form early on, as any mention of a situa-
tion with ta-/t- alternation or a generalized t- so abundant among the modern
dialects seems to be entirely absent in the descriptions of the Arab grammari-
ans. It is thus a clear morphological innovation of Quranic Arabic compared to
Proto-Arabic, but it is not explicitly attributed to the Hijaz.
4.15.2
N-prefix in the Suffix Conjugation of N-stems
Much like the tD- and tL-stems, the N-stem appears to have had a vocalized
allomorph na- in the suffix conjugation and an unvocalized allomorph -n- in
the prefix conjugation in Proto-Arabic. Evidence for this distribution is found
in Safaitic where the lack of assimilation of the n in the suffix conjugation such
as in nġḍb /naġṣ́aba/ ‘he was angered’ clearly suggests a vocalised prefix. The
form yqtl /yiqqatel/ ‘to be killed’ on the other hand appears to represent an
assimilated n-prefix (Al-Jallad 2015, 134ff.). The fact that this Old Arabic reflex
finds a parallel outside of Arabic in, e.g. Hebrew Pf. nip̄ʕal Impf. yippaʕel <
*na-pʕala, *yi-n-paʕilu (Suchard 2019, 49f.) suggests that Safaitic retains the
Proto-Arabic situation. Quranic Arabic, like Classical Arabic and, to my knowl-
edge,allmoderndialectshasgeneralizedtheunvocalizedallomorph-n-toboth
stems, yielding forms such as pf.انقلب
‘he turned’ (Q22:11) impf.ينقلب
‘he turns’
(Q2:143).While the Arab grammarians do not comment on the vocalized prefix
form at all, from the epigraphic record and comparative Semitic data it is clear
that the Quranic Arabic form is innovative.
4.15.3
The ʔan yafʕala Verbal Complement Construction
Al-Jallad (2020b, 61) identifies the ʔanyafʕala verbal complement construction
as yet another isogloss of Hijazi Arabic, in contrast to epigraphic Old Arabic.
Both the language of the Quran, and the Old Hijazi of the Damascus psalm
fragment form verbal complements with the particle ʔan followed by the sub-
junctive verb, where in Old Arabic of the Levant and North Arabia an infinitive

chapter 4
construction would be used (Al-Jallad 2015, 112f.). This seems to be a Hijazi
innovation, as its earliest attestation occurs in a fragmentary Dadanitic inscrip-
tion from al-ʕulā in the Northern Hijaz (Al-Jallad 2020b, 61). However, this is an
innovation that Quranic Arabic shares with Classical Arabic, and is thus not
identified as a Hijazi isogloss by the grammarians.
4.15.4
Use of the Definite Article al-
An interesting isogloss that is not exclusive to the Hijaz, but nevertheless forms
a clear linguistic isogloss in the Old Arabic linguistic record is the shape of
the definite article. In the Old Arabic present in the corpus of Safaitic inscrip-
tions the definite article is usually represented by a h- (presumably /haC-/),
not infrequently ʾ- and only rarely by hn- or ʾl- (Al-Jallad 2015, 11, n. 10), and
the Old Arabic of the Hismaic corpus seems to lack a definite article alto-
gether (Al-Jallad 2018b, 12). In Nabataean Arabic, on the other hand, it is always
written, לאsuggesting an unassimilated /al-/ in all contexts. This same lack of
assimilation is also found in the Arabic of the Damascus psalm fragment (Al-
Jallad 2020b, 24). For Quranic Arabic, the evidence is difficult to interpret, the
qct would suggest an unassimilated article, but this might be a purely ortho-
graphic convention—as it is in Classical Arabic—adopted from the Nabataean
writing system. Van Putten (2019b, 14f.) gives some not particularly binding
arguments why an assimilated article before apical consonants, as in Classi-
cal Arabic, might be preferable over an unassimilated situation as found in
the Damascus psalm fragment. Whatever the interpretation of the qct in this
case, that it uses the al- article, as opposed to the haC- article, the Yemeni an-
/am- articles or a completely absent definite article certainly distinguishes it
from the Old Arabic present in the northern varieties of Safaitic and Hismaic,
and puts it closer to Nabataean Arabic in this regard. The early Arab gram-
marians, however, do not recognize this as a Hijazi isogloss at all, and rather
see the al- article with assimilation as the only acceptable form of the ʕara-
biyyah.
4.16
Questionable Morphological Isoglosses
There are a few morphological isoglosses of the Hijaz discussed by Rabin (1951)
which can be deduced from the qct where it does not agree with the reported
Hijazi form. However, in these three cases, we will see that it is to be doubted
whether the isogloss is to be attributed to the whole Hijaz, or to the Hijaz at all,

the quranic consonantal text: morphology

4.16.1
The iii-w Passive Participle Is maCCuww Not maCCiyy
Al-Farrāʔ (Maʕānī, ii, 169f.) claims it is a linguistic practice of the people of the
Hijaz to retain the consonant *w in passive participles of iii-w stems, e.g. mar-
ḍuwwan rather than marḍiyyan “pleasing”. This disagrees with the qctمرضيا
(Q19:55). Rabin (1951, 161, §x) seems skeptical of this isogloss and calls it a “curi-
ous statement”. His skepticism seems warranted, because elsewhere al-Farrāʔ
(Luġāt, 92) is explicit in saying that it is only “some of the people of the Hijaz”
that do this. Therefore, it does not appear to have been a general innovation
found in all of the Hijaz.
This neutralization appears to be part of a more widespread neutraliza-
tion of iii-w and iii-y in derived nominal stems. In the qct we also seeعصيهم
/ʕu/iṣiyyu-hum/ (Q20:66, Q26:44) as the CuCūC plural ofعصا
‘rod’. Interest-
ingly, the CuCūC verbal nouns seems to mostly keep iii-w and iii-y roots dis-
tinct. Thus, we seeعلوا
/ʕuluwwā/ (Q17:4, 43; Q27:14; Q28:83) as the verbal noun
ofعلا
‘to be high, elevated’, andعتوا
/ʕutuwwā/ (Q25:21),عتو
/ʕutuww/ (Q67:21)
as the verbal noun ofعتا
‘to be insolent’, whereas we findلرقيك
/li-ru/iqiyyi-ka/
(Q17:93) as the verbal noun ofرقى
‘to ascend’ andمضيا
/mu/iḍiyyā/ (Q36:67)
as the verbal noun ofمضى
‘to go away’. The Quran however exploits verbal
nouns that have undergone this neutralization for the purpose of rhyme in
Sūrat Maryam (Q19):عتيا
/ʕu/itiyyā/ (Q19:8, 69) as an alternative verbal noun
ofعتاbesidesعتواmentioned above, andجثيا
/ǧu/iṯiyyā/ (Q19:68, 72) as the ver-
bal noun ofجثا
‘to kneel’.

madīn for passive participles of ii-y roots (Rabin 1951, 160, §u). As Rabin points
out, it is likely that the Tamīmī form is an innovative analogical formation of
the passive participle, rather than the Proto-Arabic reflex, in which case Hijazi
would simply have the Proto-Arabic form. The qct indeed has the alleged
Hijazi form, but contrary to Rabin’s claim, this does not occur only once in

Some of these “Tamīmī” forms have made it into the Classical Arabic language. Fischer
(2002, §247.2) mentions mabyūʕ ‘sold’, which occurs besides mabīʕ. Wehr (1979, s.v.) also
mentions madyūn besides madīn for ‘indebted’. In Classical Arabic the alleged Hijazi form
is dominant.

Ǧinnī (d. 392/1002) in his Kitāb al-Muġtaṣab (p. 3) does identify the mabyūʕ
type as Tamīmī, but considering how late a source Ibn Ǧinnī is, we should be
skeptical of this attribution.
4.16.3
Gt-stems of I-w verbs Is ītazara instead of ittazara
According to some grammarians Hijazi Arabic had ītazara rather than ittazara
for I-w verbs in the Gt-stem (Rabin 1951, 158f., §r). If correct, this would be
an example where the qct does not follow the Hijazi formation, cf.فاتقوا
‘so
fear!’(Q2:24)andاتسق
‘tobecomefull’(Q84:18).Theidentificationseemsdoubt-
ful however, as early sources give conflicting accounts. For example, al-Farrāʔ
(Luġāt, 20) explicitly attributes the form ittaqū with an initial long consonant
to the people of the Hijaz, while he attributes taqū to Tamīm and ʔasad. He
makes no mention of a form ītaqū.
4.16.4
The Hijazi Dual Is Uninflected, Using the Nominative Form
Rabin (1951, 156, §m) suggests that, at least in the dialect of Mecca, the dual did
not inflect for case and the nominative was used in all positions. If this is cor-
rect, then Quranic Arabic disagrees with the Meccan dialect in this regard, as
the dual is fully functional. However, this dialectal explanation seems to exist
exclusively as a pious explanation of the problematic reading ʔinna hāḏāni la-
sāḥirāni (Q20:63) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3590–3591), where from a Classical Arabic
grammatical perspective ʔabū ʕamr’s hāḏayni would be expected. There is, of
course, no a priori reason to assume that the demonstrative inflected for case
in Quranic Arabic; other demonstratives do not inflect for case either. It might
not be that the dual in general did not inflect in Hijazi, but that it was specif-
ically the dual demonstratives that did not. Such an interpretation seems to
be implicitly suggested (and attributed to the southern Hijazi tribe Banū al-
Ḥāriṯb. Kaʕb) by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 94) who only mentions the non-inflecting
nature of hāḏāni.هذٰن
(Q20:63, Q22:19) is the only form of the masculine dual
attested in the qct, whereas the feminine is only attested asهتين
(Q28:27),
there is therefore no way to confirm that the Quranic Arabic had an inflect-
ing dual. However, the qct also allows for a different interpretation. While the
particle ʔinna requires the accusative, the particle ʔin with the same function
requires the nominative. The qctان هذن لسحرنsimply accommodates such a
reading, and is indeed the canonical reading reported for Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim and
Ibn Kaṯīr.
Other case of ʔin in the function of ʔinna are found among several canon-
ical readers, e.g. Q86:4 ʔin kullu nafsin lamā ʕalayhā ḥāfiẓun “Every soul has
a guardian over it” (majority reading), as opposed to ʔin kullu nafsin lammā
ʕalayhā ḥāfiẓ“there is no soul but has a guardian over it.” (ʕāṣim, Ibn ʕāmir,

Ḥamzah, ʔabū Ǧaʕfar). Similar constructions with disagreement on lamā ver-
sus lammā are found in Q36:32 and Q43:35 (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3312–3313).
Whatever the explanation, the use of ʔin in this function, an uninflected
dual deictic or even a mere mistake in the qct—as suggested by a transmis-
sion brought by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt 94f.) in which ʕāʔišah supposedly proclaimed
this17—this can hardly be used as evidence of an isogloss of a completely unin-
flecting dual in Hijazi Arabic. Note that the use of this dual is specifically used
in direct speech, which Al-Jallad (2020b, 68f.) suggests may have been a con-
text which uses explicitly colloquial features for rhetorical effect, see section
§4.10 for more details.
4.17
The Quran Is Morphologically Hijazi
As mentioned in section §4.1 it was Rabin’s claim that, while Quranic Ara-
bic was phonologically perhaps somewhat adapted to the local Hijazi dialect,
it morphologically adhered almost completely to the poetic koiné. The prob-
lem is that Rabin—nor to my knowledge any other author—ever defines what
exactly the features morphological or otherwise of this poetic koiné are.
As we have elaborated upon in chapter 2 the very category of a ‘poetic
koiné’ as opposed to ‘dialects’ is not a dichotomy the Arabic grammarians oper-
ated within. In fact, whenever we find Sībawayh discussing a variety of differ-
ent morphological or phonological options he frequently qualifies this with
a wa-kullun ʕarabiyy—All is Arabic, even when these options are explicitly
attributedtotribes.Ithinkweshouldtakethesestatementsof thegrammarians
seriously. If we do not impose a dichotomy between an undefined and unde-
scribed poetic koiné versus the dialects, and look at which dialectal features
that can actually be recognized in the qct, a rather clear picture emerges: all
the morphological features attributed to the Hijaz that can be gleaned from the
qct indeed confirm that it is a Hijazi text.
It is worth appreciating just how different the view from the qct is in com-
parison to what we find in the reading traditions. As I showed in chapter 3, the

signal from any dialect can be recovered. Therefore, it is all the more striking
that the qct gives such a regular picture. This is unlikely to be a coincidence.
Whenever we are dealing with innovative features of Hijazi Arabic, where
the pre-Islamic epigraphic record can give us insight into this feature, we find
that likewise the northern varieties of Safaitic and Nabataean Arabic do not
appear to have undergone these innovations. This lends some credibility to
the comments of the grammarians that these innovations should indeed be
sought in the Hijaz. The table below summarizes the isoglosses discussed so
far. Some of these cases are retentions while others are innovations, but all in
all the picture is clear.Thus, let me recast Rabin’s quote mentioned at the top of
this section, in terms of what the linguistic evidence actually brings us: As for
the Quran, in morphology we find an almost complete conformity with Hijazi
Arabic has been achieved; the few Najdi forms, such as the biliteral jussive and
imperative of verbs med. gem. only appear sporadically.
Thetablebelowsummarizesthemorphologicalisoglossesof QuranicArabic
that have a clear tribal attribution among the Arab grammarians. As should be
clear, all of them invariably agree with Quranic Arabic being a Hijazi text. The
column next to it examines the presence or absence of these isoglosses in epi-
graphic Old Arabic such as Nabataean Arabic, Safaitic and Hismaic. Whenever
the epigraphic record allows us to discern this, we find that in these northern
varieties said isoglosses are absent, which lends credence to the grammarian
data that suggests these are Hijazi innovations.

The Quranic Consonantal Text: Phonology
ʕuṯmān b. ʕaffān
∵
5.1
Introduction
It has long been recognized that the orthography of the qct, in principle
reflects the phonology of Hijazi Arabic. Most notably the way that the hamzah
is (not) spelled, seems to reflect the purported loss of this sound in the Hijazi
dialect. While some authors see this tendency of the orthography as a purely
orthographic convention, envisioning that the actual language of the Quran
was pronounced with the non-Hijazi pronunciation with hamzah (e.g. Zwet-
tler 1978, 124; Versteegh 2014, 64) others do not express a clear opinion to what
extent the Hijazi orthography can reveal anything about the language of the
Quran itself (e.g. Diem 1976; 1979). However, Rabin (1951, 3f.) (also Nöldeke
1904, 11; and Blau 1977, 15f.) is quite confident that the orthography in fact
reveals something about the way the Quran was actually pronounced, saying
“the pronunciation of the literary language was of course largely accommo-
dated to their native dialect, to which the Koran spelling is therefore a fairly
reliable guide.” On other occasions, Rabin likewise expresses that the orthog-
raphy is to be taken seriously for the phonetics of Quranic Arabic. I agree with
this view, and I believe that the correctness of this assumption is confirmed toa
large extent by the Quranic rhyme (see van Putten 2018). Indeed, whenever the
rhyme allows us to examine the presence of the hamzah, for example, we must
conclude that it was in fact not there whenever the orthography suggests its
absence. Thusشان
(Q55:29) breaks the strict |-ān| rhyme of Sūrat al-Raḥmān if
read as šaʔn, whereas this problem is resolved if read as /šān/, the same is clear
forشيا
(Q19:9) which breaks the rhyme when read as šayʔā but is perfectly con-
sistentwiththe|-i/ayyā|rhymeif readas/šayyā/or/šiyyā/.Theqctthusclearly

language of the Quran, we must let the text tell us, rather than impose a set of
mutually contradictory norms presented by the canonical reading traditions.
Thischapterwilllookatsomeof thephoneticisoglossesthatcanbededuced
fromtheqct,inordertoconnectthemwiththephoneticfeaturesdiscussedby
the grammarians. Some of the features discussed here are isoglosses that Rabin
considered part of morphology. While these indeed have an effect on the mor-
phology, they are the outcome of regular sound laws, and therefore I choose
to discuss them here. Here too, we will compare the isoglosses to those found
in Northern Old Arabic like Safaitic and Nabataean Arabic, showing that sev-
eral important innovative features are indeed unattested in northern varieties,
while they are attested in the qct.
There are several phonetic isoglosses of the qct that do not get explicitly
referred to as Hijazi features according to the grammarians. Most of the time
grammarians do discuss such features, as one of the goals of the grammatical
workswastoaccountforthelanguageof theQuran.Evenwhenthereisalackof
attribution from the grammarians of certain features to the Hijaz, Rabin (1951)
frequently attributesthese featurestotheHijazbyvirtueof thembeingpresent
in the Quran. This is circular, and rather surprising as Rabin often expresses
skepticism of any attribution to Hijazi Arabic when medieval grammarians cite
the Quran as evidence for it (as he does, for example in the ḏālika rather than
ḏāka isogloss, see §4.3 above). We will only count features as confirmed to be
part of Hijazi Arabic whenever it is explicitly done so by the Arab grammar-
ians, or epigraphic evidence suggests that the innovation is at least absent in
Northern Old Arabic. It should be noted, however, that the grammarians report
linguisticdatafromanotinsignificanttimeafterthecompositionof theQuran.
As a result, it is possible that when data reported by the grammarians does not
align with the qct being Hijazi, this could still rather be the result of a differ-
ence in time, rather than a true disagreement. Often it is not possible to prove
this with any certainty, but at times papyri and early Islamic epigraphy may
yield some insights.
5.2
The Loss of the *ʔ
As Rabin (1951, 130, §l,m,n) says: “the most celebrated feature of the Hijaz
dialect is the disappearance of the hamza, or glottal stop.” Indeed, this is a
feature universally attributed to the Hijaz by the Arab grammarians, and it
is widely recognized to be the foundation for the Islamic Arabic orthography
(Diem 1976). Van Putten (2018) argues that, not only does a ʔ-less dialect form
the basis of the orthography of the qct, but the Quranic rhyme confirms that

the orthography is, in fact, an accurate representation of the Quranic Arabic
phonology and therefore had lost ʔ in almost every position. The table below
summarizes the evidence of the loss of hamzah that can be derived from the
Quranic rhyme. First listing the qct spelling, and the readings, and finally the

One exception tothis generalloss seems tohave been the word-final ʔalif mam-
dūdah (i.e. -āʔ) which appears to have retained some phonetic trace of the *ʔ,
either as stress + hiatus, or indeed a true glottal stop realization (see Van Put-
ten 2018: 103–105). Rabin (1951, 141, §ee) alludes to the possibility that this may
be a place where the Hijaz retained the hamzah whereas eastern dialects lost
it. Later lexicographical works shows some lexical items with Hijazi -āʔ corre-
sponding to eastern -ā/-ē but among the early grammarians I have only found
evidence for this correspondence in the plural deictic which is said to be hāʔu-
lāʔi in the Hijaz while it is (hā)-ʔulā/ē in the eastern dialects (see §4.4).
Despite an almost universal attribution of hamzah-loss to the Hijaz by later
grammarians, neither Sībawayh nor al-Farrāʔ are very explicit in attributing
this loss to the Hijaz. Sībawayh gives a detailed account in the manner that
the hamzah may be lost in Arabic (Sībawayh iv, 541ff.), but at no point does
he attribute this dropping specifically to the Hijaz. The developments he dis-
cusses are clearly similar to those suggested by Van Putten (2018) and Diem
(1980) to have taken place in the (orthography of) the qct. However, to Sīb-
awayh this form of dropping of the hamzah was acceptable within what he
considered ʕarabiyyah, and the highly conservative application of the hamzah
so closely associated with Classical Arabic today, does not seem to have been
the stereotypical feature of proper Arabic in his time. Al-Farrāʔ does not explic-
itly attribute the complete loss of hamzah to the Hijaz either, but when we
examine the cases where he does attribute the loss of hamzah to certain tribes,
it is invariably to the people of the Hijaz or Qurayš. If we were to generalize

chapter 5
these isolated statements (something that is not necessarily warranted, nor
explicitly unwarranted from the structure of the text), we indeed end up with
all the developments typically associated with the Hijazi hamzah-loss, and a
situation that closely matches the qct. The list below is a comparison of what
is reported in terms of hamzah-loss in al-Farrāʔ’s Luġāt al-Qurʔān.
– mustahziʔūna > mustahzūna (Qurayš and the common people of Ġaṭafān
and Kinānah, p. 15); qctمستهزون
(Q2:14)
– sayyiʔah > sayyah, sayyiyah (People of the Hijaz, p. 30); qctسييه
(Q2:81).The
collapse of the yyiy sequence to yy seems to take place in the pluralالسيات
(passim)
– ʔanbiʔū-nī > ʔanbū-nī (Qurayš, p. 22); qctانبونى
(Q2:31).
– isʔal > sal (People of the Hijaz, p. 34); qct( لسQ2:211 and passim).
– ridʔan > ridan (People of the Hijaz, p. 113); qctردا
(Q28:34).
– riʔyan > riyyan (People of the Hijaz, p. 90); qctريا
(Q19:74).1
– al-minsaʔah > al-minsāh (People of the Hijaz, p. 119, cf. Maʕānī al-Qurʔān, ii,
256); qctمنسٰته
(Q34:14).
– at-tanāʔuš > at-tanāwuš (People of the Hijaz, p. 119, cf. Maʕānī al-Qurʔān, ii,
365); qctالتنٰوش
(Q34:52).
To this we may add the following Isolated statements in his Maʕānī al-Qurʔān:
– yaklaʔu-kum > yaklawu-kum, yaklā-kum (Qurayš, vol. ii, p. 204); qctيكلوكم
(Q21:42).
Al-Farrāʔ’s statements therefore seem to confirm the conclusion that the Hijazi
dialect lacked hamzah.
The loss of hamzah is a Hijazi feature to the Arab grammarians, and this
seems to be corroborated by the epigraphic record. The northern varieties of
Nabataean, Safaitic (as well as Hismaic) perfectly retain the hamzah in all posi-
tions (e.g. Al-Jallad 2015, 45, 53; van Putten 2018, 96). This is especially relevant
in the case of Nabataean Arabic. As the Nabataean script is the one ancestral
to the modern Arabic script, the difference in orthographic practice between
Nabataean Arabic and the qct is striking. We find that Nabataean Arabic con-
sistently employs the ʔalif to denote the hamzah, even in places where in the
qct it would go unwritten or would be written with a glide. The fact that the
qct’s orthography differs appreciably in this regard and abandons manners of
writing the hamzah in favour of hamzah-less spellings is a strong indication of
an orthographic innovation to accommodate the vernacular.
1 Al-Farrāʔ that al-ʔaʕmaš and ʕāṣim read with hamzah, but that without hamzah is more well-
formed for recitation (ʔahyaʔu fī l-qirāʔah), a nice example of an explicit endorsement of a
hamza-less form.This opinion of al-Farrāʔ is no doubt inspired by the fact that riyyan is better
in line with the rhyme of this Sūrah than the reading riʔyan.

5.3
Development of the Phoneme ō
Quranic Arabic has several cases where a mater lectionis wāw is used where all
canonical reading traditions read it with ā, these are:الصلوه
‘the prayer’,الزكوه
‘alms’,الحيوه
‘the life’,منوه
‘Manāt (pre-Islamic goddess)’,النجوه
‘the salvation’,
مشكوه
‘lamp niche’ andالغدوه
‘morning’. Modern scholars have generally taken
theseaspurelyorthographicidiosyncrasiesof thesewords—oftensuggestedto
beinspiredbyAramaic—andassumedtheysimplyhadavowelāasinClassical
Arabic, but as the Arabic roots clearly have a distinct etymological origin (con-
taining a *w in the root) and predictable phonetically conditioned behaviour, it
seems more likely that these words in fact had a long vowel /ō/ in the final syl-
lable, that is /aṣ-ṣalōh/, /az-zakōh/, /al-ḥayōh/, /manōh/, /an-naǧōh/, /miškōh/
and /al-ġadōh/ (Al-Jallad 2017c; van Putten 2017a).
There are good qct-internal and comparative reasons to see this as an inno-
vation of Quranic Arabic, for example Safaitic still retains an original triph-
thong here ngwt /nagawat/ ‘salvation’ (Al-Jallad & Jaworska 2019, 102), also the
Arab grammarians clearly saw this pronunciation for specifically these words
as typical for the Hijaz, as opposed to the pronunciation with /ā/ found else-
where. Sībawayh (iv, 432), for example, calls it “the ʔalif al-tafxīm, by which is
meant the linguistic practice of the people of the Hijaz in their speech of aṣ-
ṣalōh, az-zakōh and al-ḥayōh.” This statement has often been taken to mean
that all cases of /ā/ where pronounced backed/rounded by the people of the
Hijaz, or word-final stressed /ā/ was (e.g. Rabin 1951, 105f.; Testen 2005, 219),
but this is not in keeping with the evidence. The feminine plural -āt is never
spelled with wāw nor are nouns of the shape CaCāC, CiCāC, CuCāC etc. The
fact that Sībawayh specifically cites the words that are spelled with a wāw in
the qct, and not any other words suggests that it is words specifically of this
type, i.e. original *CaCawat- nouns that undergo this shift.
5.4
Lack of Cyī > Cī
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 21) reports that the Qurayš and commonly among the Arabs
yastaḥyī is pronounced with the expected yī sequence, but Tamīm and Bakr
b. Wāʔil read it yastaḥī. While the modern Cairo Edition text agrees with the
Tamīmī form, this is an idiosyncrasy of the print edition. The qct as it is
reflected in early Quranic manuscripts consistently agrees with the common
form also found among the Qurayš, e.g.يستحيى
(Q2:26)يحيى
(Q2:258) (for a fur-
ther discussion, see Appendix A.2.2).

The passive perfect of hollow verbs had three forms. In the Hijaz qīla, with the
Qays and part of ʔasad dialect with a front rounded vowel qǖla and qūla among
the Tamīm, Faqʕas and Dabr (§2.2.2.5; Rabin 1951, 159, §t; al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 14).2
These are different dialectal outcomes of what in Proto-Arabic was probably
still a triphthong *quwila.3 The qct aligns with the Hijazi form, e.g.( ليقQ2:11
and passim).
5.6
Retention of ṣirāṭ
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt 9f.) tells us that the word ṣirāṭ‘road’ is the form used by the
Qurayš, while other pronunciations exist:
– sirāṭ, a reading attributed to Ibn ʕabbās
– Qays is supposed to have pronounced it with the initial sound in between s
and ṣ.4
– zirāṭ, a reading he attributed to Ḥamzah5 and the tribes of ʕuḏrah, Kalb and
Banū Qayn.
Al-Farrāʔ points out the qct explicitly agrees with the Qurashi form: “as for
الصراط
,there are four linguistic practices: the perfect practice is the first prac-
tice of the Qurayš, which is what the book (the Quran) brings (written) with a
ṣād.” Indeed ‘path’ is always spelledصرط, الصرطin the qct.
The grammarians seem to have considered the form sirāṭthe original and
the Qurayš form the result of emphasis spread, but from an etymological per-
spective this is to be doubted.6 This word being a loan from the Latin strata
(presumably through Greek and Aramaic), it seems that the ṣwas used as a
2 Sībawayh (iv, 342f.) discusses these forms but does not attribute the forms to specific tribes.
3 Other triphthongs such as awi, awu, awa appear to have not yet collapsed in Proto-Arabic as
Safaitic generally retains them (Al-Jallad 2015, 119f.).
4 This might be seen as further corroboration that Al-Jallad (2014a) is right to see Sībawayh’s
description of the ṣād as an affricate, and that this description should be seen as endorsing a
pronunciation that is an emphatic sibilant ṣād, as it is pronounced in modern dialects today.
5 In modern recitation, Ḥamzah’s reading is said to be pronounced in between ṣād and zāy,
which in practice means it is pronounced as an emphatic z, i.e. [zˤ] (Ibn Muǧāhid 105–107;
Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1119).
6 See for example Lisān (1993b) which says ṣirāṭis a dialectal form (luġah) and that sirāṭis
the origin (ʔaṣl). This seems to be mirrored in other lexicographical works, as Lane (1348c)
mirrors the same perspective from several sources.

means to represent the cluster st.This strategy is found elsewhere in Arabic, for
example in qaṣr < Lat. castrum.7The Qurayš form should therefore probably be
considered a retention, rather than an innovation.
5.7
Lack of Syncopation of *u and *i
Hijazi was known for its conservative syllable structure compared to Najdi. As
discussed in §2.2.4, whenever two short syllables follow, and the second con-
tains a high vowel u or i, it would syncopate, while Hijazi retains such forms.
Basic noun formations affected by this are the following:
Hijaz
Najd
CuCuC
CuCC
CiCiC
CiCC
CaCuC
CaCC
CaCiC
CaCC
CuCiC
CuCC
CaCiCah
CaCCah
CaCuCah
CaCCah
Due to the qct not recording short vowels, it is difficult to be entirely sure what
the status of the syllable structure is in Quranic Arabic, however words of this
type occasionally stand in rhyming position, which lets us make some deduc-
tions about the application of this syncopation.
However, as we can only examine these forms in rhyme, another com-
plication is added to this examination, as Sībawayh (iv, 173ff.) reports that
“some Arabs” would insert vowels to break up final CC-clusters in pause. In
CaCC nouns the nominative and genitive are inserted giving hāḏā bakur# (for
bakrun)and wa-minbakir#(forbakrin).Sībawayhdoesnotexplicitlystatewhat
7 This borrowing strategy should either be understood as the ṣstill being an affricate at the
time these words were borrowed and [tsˤ] being considered the closest equivalent to [st].
But alternatively it may be the case that these words entered Hijazi Arabic through a dialect
where the reflex of Proto-Arabic *ṣwas [st] or [ṣṭ], much like some of the modern dialects of
the Saʕdah region in Yemen today (Behnstedt 1987, 7).

happens to the accusative, except that the a is not inserted. For the indefinite
one of course gets bakrā# (for bakran), but for al-bakra it is unclear, perhaps it
is optionally to be read as al-bakir# or al-bakur# (see Sībawayh, iv, 174, l. 3). For
CiCCandCuCCnounsitisclearthatthevowelsimplyharmonizeswiththepre-
ceding vowel, and the case vowel has no effect: hāḏā ʕidil# (< ʕidlun) or fisil# (<
fislun), fī l-busur# (for busrin), raʔaytu l-ʕikim# (for al-ʕikma), raʔaytu l-ǧuḥur#
(al-ǧuḥra).WhileSībawayhdoesnotexplicitlyattributetheseformstoacertain
dialect, he does mention that those who insert vowels in those cases are those
who weaken al-busuru to al-busru in context; these are the Najdi dialects,and it
therefore seems clear that this is an eastern practice, not part of Hijazi Arabic.
Therefore, comparing the Hijazi to Najdi forms in pause we would expect the
following reflexes.

It is not clear how CaCiCun and CaCuCun nouns would behave in the Najdi
dialects as Sībawayh does not explicitly discuss them, but it seems likely that
the etymological vowel would simply return in such environments in pause.
Now if we turn to the Quranic rhyme, we can make some predictions on
which forms can rhyme with which, depending on whether the Quran had
Najdi or Hijazi style syllabification. If Quranic Arabic had Najdi style syllab-
ification, one would expect original CvCiCā, CvCuCā to rhyme freely with
CvCCā, while in Hijazi syllabification these would be expected to remain dis-
tinct.
Moreover, due to the probable lack of epenthesis in CC-clusters in pause
in Hijazi, it seems likely that if the Quran had Hijazi syllabification that non-

127
indefinite accusative CvCiC, and CvCuC nouns should not rhyme freely with
CvCC nouns. Indeed, on examining the different rhymes in the qct, we find a
distribution that is consistent with Hijazi syllabification.
5.7.1
vCCā Rhymes
There are many examples of indefinite accusative rhymes where the preced-
ing sequence is consistently a long consonant or a consonant cluster. These,
as a rule, do not rhyme with words where one expects a vowel in between
the two consonants in Hijazi. There are a few exceptions to this among the
Quranic reading traditions, most of which can be explained, and these will
be discussed below. Sequences with a consonant cluster indefinite accusative
rhyme are: Q18:65–83; Q19:76–98; Q20:97–115; Q37:1–3; Q51:1–4; Q65; Q77:1–6;
Q79:1–5; Q80:25–31; Q100:1–5.
5.7.2
vCā Rhymes
vCCā rhymes are clearly distinct from rhymes that do not have a consonant
cluster before the indefinite accusative ending and thus rhyme in vCā. Exam-
ples of this type of rhyme are: Q18:1–64 and Q72.
5.7.3
vCC Rhymes
Rhymes in a consonantal cluster vCC are relatively rare, but common enough
that their lack of rhyming with vC rhymes seems consistent. Examples are
Q77:32–33, Q86:11–14, Q89:1–5; Q97; Q103.
5.7.4
vC Rhymes
vC rhymes are relatively rare, only showing up in Q51:7–9 and the whole of Q54.
The rhyming patterns in Q54 are especially telling. Word-final geminates are
treated as a single consonant, and thus al-qamar (Q54:1) may rhyme with mus-
tamirr (Q54:2).
5.7.5
Discussion
The general pattern of these rhymes is clear: as a rule u and i were not syn-
copated, following the Hijazi Arabic practice. This is clear for nouns that end
in aCiC or aCuC, which can be seen in the table below. Counterexamples to
this pattern do not exist. While aCi/uC rhymes not followed by the indefinite
accusative would likely have this shape in Najdi as well due to the epenthesis
discussed above, we would expect such cases to rhyme freely with aCC nouns,
which they do not.

For some of the readers waladā seems to rhyme with CvCCā stems in some
contexts and CaCaCā in others.ولداoccurs seven times in rhyme position, three
times in an expected CaCaCā rhyme, and four times in a CvCCā rhyme. How-
ever, when look at the other reading traditions, we find that in the CvCCā
rhyme, Ḥamzah and al-Kisāʔī read this word as wuldā in the places where the
rhyme seems to conflict (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3570). The table below tabulates the
words in their context.

There are two cases in Q18, where the rhyme word seems to conflict, where
we find a word universally read as CvCCā in both cases flanked by CaCaCā,
these areتسعا
/tisʕā/ (Q18:25; preceding rhyme /rašadā/ and following rhyme
/aḥadā/) andزرعا
/zarʕā/ (Q18:32; preceding rhyme /murtafaqā/, following
rhyme /naharā/). Both of these words end in ʕ, and one wonders whether there
was a vocalic epenthesis under the influence of this guttural to yield /tisaʕā/
and /zaraʕā/. In the case of Q18:32 another solution, however, may simply be
that the verse does not end there. According to the Meccan and old Medinan
verse countزرعاis not the end of the verse (Spitaler 1935, 42).
5.7.6
Alternation between CuCuC and CuCC Nouns
Remaining exceptions are primarily found with nouns of the shape CuCuC or
CuCC, where in several cases the rhyme suggests that Quranic Arabic had the
shape CuCuC, but CuCCā for the indefinite accusative, i.e. following a synco-
pation and epenthesis model that is more similar to what is reported for Najd.
However, not all nouns with the CuCuC shape seem to behave this way, which
makes it difficult to evaluate the evidence.
Several CuCuC nouns, from their rhyme context should clearly be under-
stood as non-syncopating in all contexts. For some of these words, several of
the readers adhere to CuCC readings, but it seems evident from the rhyme that
this is not the correct reading.

In two cases, however, rhyme seems to suggest a pronunciation with CuCuC
in every form but the indefinite accusative, where the indefinite accusative is
CuCCā with syncope in the indefinite accusative. In the case of nuḏur ‘warn-

‘denial’ the nukur/nukrā alternation is disagreed upon by the readers, although
the majority also has nukur/nukrā as the rhyme suggests.

languages, nouns with the shape CuCuC are excessively rare (Fox 2013, 203ff.).
Fox(2013,205)suggeststhismayhavebeentheshapeof theinfinitiveconstruct
in Hebrew, e.g. qəṭol < *qutul-, while *qtul- has also been suggested (Suchard
2019, 246). Besides this, only the isolated nouns bəḵor ‘first-born’ (cf. Syr. bŭḵur,
buḵrā) and ḥălom ‘dream’ (cf. CAr. ḥulum, ḥulm) seem to point to such a noun
shape.
Arabic CuCuC nouns often have byforms with the shape CuCC (generally
attributed to eastern dialects by the grammarians), but frequently correspond
to formations in other Semitic languages that unambiguously point to CuCC.
For example, fractions like such as rubuʕ, rubʕ ‘fourth’ and xumus, xums ‘fifth’
correspondtoHebrewroḇaʕ ‘fourth’andḥomɛš ‘fifth’;theHebrewformsunam-
biguously point to *rubʕ- and *xums¹-. A similar conflict is found with CAr.
ʔuḏun, ʔuḏn ‘ear’, Hb. ʔozɛn < *ʔuḏn. For this reason, many authors (e.g. Rabin
1951, 97f.; Fox 2013, 150) have suggested that these forms are the result of
dialects with vocalic epenthesis of *CuCC > CuCuC and in other cases syncope
*CuCuC > CuCC. However, this cannot entirely account for the variation that
we see.
In the Arabic as described by the early grammarians, CuCuC and CuCC
nouns are contrastive. CuCuC nouns are frequently used for plural nouns
whose singular has a CvCv̄C shape, e.g. kitāb pl. kutub ‘book’ and rasūl pl. rusul
‘messenger’ (Ratcliffe 1998, 105) whereas the plural of elatives and adjectives
of colour and bodily defects have a plural pattern CuCC, for example ʔakbar
pl. kubr ‘greater’ and ʔaḥmar pl. ḥumr ‘red’. Minimal pairs such as ḥumur (sg.
ḥimār)‘donkeys’versusḥumr (m.sg.ʔaḥmar)‘red(pl.)’suggestthatwearedeal-
ing with a genuine contrast.16
The possibility of the existence of CuCuC nouns besides CuCC nouns, even
within a single dialect would allow to explain why specifically nouns of this
shape seem to yield conflicting results in terms of the syllable structure reflect
in the rhyme. Therefore it seems that Fox (2013, 150) is correct to say that not
all CuCuC ~ CuCC alternation can be explained as the result of epenthesis and
syncope, and that, for reasons that are not entirely clear anymore, some forms
of Arabic, including Quranic Arabic, had the freedom to use CuCuC and CuCC
shapes side by side.
16
One might cast doubt on this contrast as it appears in a literary language, and could be
envisioned to be an invention of the grammarians to form a contrast between the two.
While in quite a few dialects the two patterns do merge (either towards CuCuC or towards
CuCC),atleastinCaireneArabicthecontrastappearstobemaintained,e.g.kitābpl.kutub
but ʔaṭraš pl. ṭurš ‘deaf’.

5.8
Development of the Phoneme ē
Rabin (1951, 160, §v) points out that a distinction between ʔalif maqṣūrah when
the root is iii-y and iii-w both in verbs and in nouns is clearly present in the
rhyme and spelling of the qct (see also Nöldeke et al. 2013, 415; van Putten
2017a). Thus, we findهدى
/hadē/17 ‘he guided’ (Q2:143) versusدعا
/daʕā/ ‘he
called’ (Q3:38), andالهدى
/al-hudē/ ‘guidance’ (Q3:73) versusسنا
/sanā/ ‘flash’
(Q24:43). While Rabin takes the form hadē etc. as analogical innovations from
*hadā, it is now clear from Pre-Islamic Arabic and comparative evidence that
the vowels ē and ā have distinct etymological origins, where ē develops from
*ayV, whereas ā either descends from original *ā or from *awV (van Putten
2017a).
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 21f.) explicitly states that the people of the Hijaz merge the
iii-y and iii-w verbs towards ā, whereas the people of Najd have ē for iii-y verbs
and ā for iii-w verbs. He adds that it is best to pronounce the vowel in between
“extreme i” (al-kasr al-šadīd) and “extreme a” (al-fatḥal-šadīd) and that the
majority of Arabs and readers follow that practice. This comment is surprising
on several levels. First, al-Farrāʔ seems to explicitly endorse making a distinc-
tionbetweenthetwolongvowels,differentfromwhatbecomesthestandardin
Classical Arabic which merges the two towards ā, and second that it is certainly
not the majority of readersorArabswhomakethisdistinctiontoday.Thislatter
comment should probably be understood from the Kufan context from which
al-Farrāʔ writes.The Kufan readers Ḥamzah, al-Kisāʔī and Xalaf all read the iii-
y with /ē/.Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ also makes this distinction consistently, pronouncing
the iii-y with /ǟ/.The rest of the readersof the 10 all regularly mergethe sounds
(with the exception of ʔabū ʕamr at the end of a verse, see §3.6.6.1). The com-
ment that the ‘majority of the Arabs’ apparently had a phonemic distinction
between /ǟ/ (if in between extreme i and extreme a does not just point to /ē/)
17
Rabin takes this final ē to have been phonetically a diphthong [ay].The spelling in the qct
does not allow us to distinguish the monophthongal value [ē] from [ay], but I take the
monophthongal pronunciation in the readings of Ḥamzah and al-Kisāʔī to be significant
here. I am not convinced by Owens’ (2006, 199) argument for seeing ʔimālah as a rising
diphthong [iə] or [ia]. This analysis is primarily based on the idea that ʔimālah is spelled
with a kasrah in front of the ʔalif by Sībawayh and that other authors such as Ibn Muǧāhid
even describe ʔimālah, for example in a word like ṭēba as having “kasr al-ṭāʔ”.This analysis
(although by no means certain) might work in front of ʔimālized ās that are written ʔalif,
but breaks down in words like hadē spelledهَدِى
,by Owens’ logic these words should be
pronounced **hadī. Indeed, such cases of ʔimālah are explicitly described in the same
terms, e.g. Al-Farrāʔ (lughāt, 21): wa-kaṯīrun min ʔahli naǧdin yaksirūna, fa-yaqūlūnaق َضِى,
رَمِى, وسَوِّى
,wa-yaftaḥūna ḏawāt al-wāw […].

and /ā/ does highlight that whatever ‘Arabic’ was at the time of al-Farrāʔ, was
clearly distinct from textbook Classical Arabic.
If al-Farrāʔiscorrectinattributingtheē/ācontrastof thisfeaturetotheNajd,
then this would mean we have a phonetic feature of Quranic Arabic that is
proper to Najdi Arabic rather than to the Hijaz. If this feature was ever part of
Hijazi Arabic, it seems that at the time that Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ were active,
this distinction had clearly fallen out of use in the Hijaz, some 150 years after
the codification of the Quranic text. There are perhaps a few remaining mem-
ories of the feature in the Hijaz to be discovered in Sībawayh’s Kitāb. Rabin
points to the passage in Sībawayh (iv, 256) where he tells us that “some Arabs
say ṣawaray, qahalay and ḍafaway, so they make it (the ʔalif maqṣūrah) a yāʔ,
and they are like those they agree with those who say ʔafʕay, and these are peo-
ple from Qays and the people of the Hijaz”. This appears to be a reference to
Sībawayh (iii, 414) where he says that “some Arabs say ʔafʕay, with the hiding
of the ʔalif in pause; and if it is pronounced in context, it is not done. And from
them there are some that say ʔafʕay in pause and in context, so they make a yāʔ
follow it.” All of these statements exclusively pertain to the feminine ending -ē,
it is difficult to decide how we should understand this with stem-internal forms
such as al-hudē and banē.
More salient evidence that a shift of the treatment of ē towards ā was under
way in the early Islamic period can be found in early transcriptions and devel-
oping orthography in papyri and inscriptions of this period. Graeco-Arabic
transcriptions of the first century show that ē was still distinct among the con-
querors of Egypt in the first Islamic century, e.g. μαυλε /mawlē/ ‘client’, ιαειε
/yaḥyē/ ‘Yaḥyā (personal name)’, ιαλε /yaʕlē/ ‘Yaʕlā (personal name)’ (Al-Jallad
2017d, 431). By the time that the Damascus Psalm Fragment was written, which
may be as early as the 8th century, the contrast that was present in the first
Islamic century has disappeared (Al-Jallad 2020b, 47f.).
In Arabic papyri and inscriptions, we find evidence for such a shift as well.
One of the typical features of Quranic orthography is that the ē is written with
yāʔ in all contexts.While Classical Arabic orthography continues to distinguish
iii-y and iii-w in word-final position, e.g.هدىhadā andدعاdaʕā, the contrast is
neutralized before pronominal suffixes, e.g.هداهhadā-hu andدعاهdaʕā-hu. In
Quranic orthography however, such suffixed forms are not written with an ʔalif
but are written with a yāʔ just like in final position, i.e.هديه
,clearly suggesting
the vowel was not yet homophonous to the ʔalif.
Finding spellings of either type in the early Islamic period is difficult, but the
Muʕāwiyah dam inscriptions from 58ah has the Quranic style of spelling:بنيه
‘he built it’, instead of **بناه
(Miles 1948). By the time the formulation benedic-
tion ʔabqā-ka/hu ḷḷāh ‘may God preserve you/him’ becomes popular in papyri

the eighth century, the Classical spelling is the only one attested, e.g.اٮڡاه الله
(cpr xxi 5, l. 3; 182ah).18 If we assume the inscriptions and papyri to be direct
continuations of the language of the Quran, this data could be interpreted as
showing a diachronic development of Quranic/Hijazi Arabic from a situation
that distinguishes ē and ā to one that has merged the two sounds. The eastern
dialects would then appear to have held off this merger for a longer time, and
thus make it into the descriptions of the grammarians.19 The fact that the Arab
grammarians consider this ē purely a by-form of the ʔalif—even though it is a
separate phoneme—also suggests that the base language the grammarians are
arguing from is a dialect that has merged these forms.
From a pre-islamic epigraphic perspective we can see some interesting de-
velopments that, however, do not help much towards solving this conundrum.
In Safaitic the historical triphthongs are still actual triphthongs, i.e. *aya and
*awa (Al-Jallad 2015, 47), e.g. ʿlw [ʕalawa] ‘to ascend’. However iii-w often
merges towards iii-y, e.g. ngw [nagawa], ngy [nagaya] ‘to escape’ (Al-Jallad and
Jaworska 2019). In Hismaic, the *awa seems to have collapsed towards ā, while
the *aya was still distinct, i.e. dʿ [daʕā] ‘he called’ but bny [banay(a)] ‘he built’
(Al-Jallad 2020a). For Nabataean Arabic, the sounds appear to have collapsed
to ā, as final *ayV sequences are spelled with aleph:אלעזא
/al-ʕozzā/ ‘al-ʿUzzā’
(Cantineau 1978, 128) andדושרא
/ḏū šarrā/ ‘Dousares’ (Cantineau 1978, 80).
The qct in having the ē/ā contrast is thus archaic (and more archaic than
Nabataean Arabic) and not innovative in this regard.
5.9
Hollow Root ʔimālah
Where Quranic Arabic appears to have retained a distinction between word-
final triphthongs with iii-w and iii-y, the triphthong in hollow roots has quite
clearly collapsed to ā. These are still distinct triphthongs in the Old Arabic
reflected in most Safaitic inscriptions (Al-Jallad 2015, 47), and al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt,
17) indeed confirms what the qct suggests (see §2.2.2.3): The people of the
Hijaz pronounced with a pure ā regardless of whether the second root conso-
nant was w or y. But the common people of the Najd, among the Tamīm, ʔasad
and Qays would apply ʔimālah to the ii-y roots such as šēʔa, ǧēʔa, xēfa, ṭēba,
kēda and zēġa.

Although even there not unscathed, the descriptions of Sībawayh and al-Farrāʔ are irrec-
oncilable, which suggests even there a merger may have been under way (§3.3.3.3).

chapter 5
Rabin (1951, 111–113) sees this quote (which he gets indirectly from Ibn Yaʕīš)
as a contradiction with what Sībawayh says. As Sībawayh (iv, 120) says that it
is a linguistic practice among some of the people of the Hijaz (wa-hiya luġatun
li-baʕḍi ʔahli l-ḥiǧāz). Thus, he suggests that Ibn Yaʕīš mistakenly reversed the
attribution of this type of ʔimālah to the Najdi tribes. Now that we no longer
need to rely on the indirect quote of Ibn Yaʕīš (Šarḥal-Mufaṣṣal, v, 188), but
have access to the quote of al-Farrāʔ directly, it is now confirmed that Ibn Yaʕīš
was quoting al-Farrāʔ correctly, despite the apparent contradiction with Sīb-
awayh.
However, one wonders whether this should be understood as a contradic-
tion between the two authors, rather than a lack of specificity of Sībawayh.
Sībawayh(iv,120f.)attributesthecollapseof themedialtriphthongtoē tobe“a
linguisticpracticeamongsomeof thepeopleof theHijaz;butthegeneralpopu-
lace does not apply ʔimālah.” He makes no mention of whether this is practiced
outside of the Hijaz. This interpretation would seem to resolve the apparent
contradiction between the report of al-Farrāʔ and Sībawayh. The fact that it is
explicitlymentionedtobeamarginalfeatureintheHijazmeansthatweshould
not find it particularly surprising that the feature is absent in the qct.
5.10
Major Assimilation in Gt-stems.
Another case where a feature that we find in the Quran does not get attributed
to the Hijaz is the occasional assimilation of coronal consonants across vowel
boundaries. Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 27) reports that many of Qays and Tamīm say
muhaddūna or muhuddūna for muhtadūna whereas the people of the Hijaz
avoid such assimilations.
There are three places in the Quran where the qct could be understood
as having undergone such an assimilation. First is Q10:35يهدىwhich is var-
iously read as, yahaddī, yahăddī, yahiddī, yahddī, yihiddī and yahdī (Ibn al-
Ǧazarī, §3256), second Q36:49يخصمونwhich is variously read as yaxaṣṣimūna,
yaxăṣṣimūna, yaxiṣṣimūna, yaxṣṣimūna and yaxṣimūna (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4010)
and finally Q4:154تعدواvariously read as taʕddū, taʕaddū, taʕăddū and the rest
taʕdū. These three verbs also occur unassimilated elsewhere in the Quran (e.g.
Q10:108; Q3:44; Q2:231). Whether we are really dealing with assimilated forms
of this type, however, depends on the trust one places in the majority of the
readers to properly reflect the language of the qct, and how much trust one
places in the linguistic facts as presented by al-Farrāʔ.
On discussing the form Q10:35يهدى
,al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 72) tell us that among
the people of the Hijaz hadā ‘to lead’ may have the same meaning as ihtadā ‘to

be rightly guided’ and that the readers used to recite this verse as ʔam-man
yahdī ʔillā ʔan yuhdā using that meaning thus: “or he who is rightly guided
only if he is guided (himself)” rather than the straightforward understanding
of this reading with yahdī “or he who guides only if he is guided (himself).”
If we accept al-Farrāʔ’s report that hadā may have the meaning of ihtadā in
the dialect of the Hijaz, then we are not clearly dealing with the qct reflect-
ing a non-Hijazi form, as this verse may have been read as yahdī, lacking the
non-Hijazi assimilation. However, there is some reason to doubt this account.
Al-Farrāʔ’s teacher al-Kisāʔī and his teacher Ḥamzah are the only canonical
readers that read yahdī. Al-Farrāʔ’s comment may be a fabrication to simulta-
neously defend the semantics of the majority reading and the pronunciation of
his fellow Kufans.We do find examples where G- and Gt-stems of the same root
have (more or less) the same meaning, this tends to happen when the Gt-stem
hasamedialtransitive,notpassivemeaning,andthereforehasameaningclose
to the transitive G-stem, e.g. šarā-hu ‘he bought it’ and ištarā-hu ‘he bought it
(for himself)’. In the case of hadā in the meaning of ihtadā, however, we are not
dealing with a medial transitive meaning of the Gt-stem but a passive mean-
ing of the G-stem. I know of no example where the G-stem can have a passive
meaning where the Gt-stem does too.
Q36:49يخصمونyields less obvious semantic problems. Both xaṣama and
ixtaṣama may have more or less the same meaning “to quarrel”, although
the former also has a transitive meaning “to quarrel with someone”. Al-Farrāʔ
(Luġāt, 120) comments on the different outcomes of the assimilation of the
ixtaṣama reading, but makes no special comment on the semantic of Ḥamzah’s
reading yaxṣimūna. He gives a more in-depth discussion of the meaning of this
reading in his Maʕānī al-Qurʔān (Al-Farrāʔ Maʕānī, ii, 379).
Q4:154تعدواlikewise yields few semantic problems.Both ʕadā and iʕtadā can
have the meaning “to transgress”. Al-Farrāʔ does not discuss this variant, pre-
sumably because in this case the G-stem interpretation is the majority reading
(and the reading of the Kufans he was most intimately familiar with).

out the Quran, not infrequently, we find examples of assimilation of especially
coronal consonants or identical consonants across vowels. This is especially
commonly attested with tD- and tL-stems, such as fa-taṭahharū →فاطهرواfa-
ṭṭahharū (Q5:6). It also occurs in cases where two consonants assimilating are
identical, examples in the qct are:اتحجونىʔa-tuḥāǧǧūn-nī ‘do you argue with
me?’ (Q6:80),20تامرونىtaʔmurūn-nī, tāmurūn-nī, taʔmurūn-niya, tāmurūn-niya

Itseemsthenthatthiskindof assimilationacrossvowelswassomewhatpro-

dialects of Arabic at all, and seem to be quite particular to Quranic Arabic.
5.11
*raʔaya, *naʔaya > rāʔa, nāʔa
Another feature suggested by Rabin (1951, 142f., §ii) to be a Hijazi development
is the apparent metathesis of original ii-ʔ iii-y verbs to ii-y iii-ʔ, thus original
*raʔaya ‘to see’ and *naʔaya ‘to move away’ shift to rāʔa and nāʔa rather than
raʔēandnaʔē.TheseverbsareregisteredintheArabiclexicographicaltradition
(Lane 1197b; Lisān 4590c), and it is quite clear that their spelling in the qct as
( ارe.g. Q6:76, 77, 78) and( انQ17:83; Q41:51) should be understood as reflecting
such forms (as also recognized by Rabin). While none of the canonical readers
read raʔā/ē as rāʔa—despite the rasm—Ibn Ḏakwān ʕan Ibn ʕāmir and ʔabū
Ǧaʕfar both read naʔā/ē as nāʔa (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3478).
The suggestions that this form is Hijazi is confirmed by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt,
80f.) who comments on these words. He claims that both naʔā and raʔā are
the Qurashi form and he adds that this is how one recites the Quran (he is
seemingly unaware of Ibn ʕāmir and ʔabū Ǧaʕfar’s reading). He follows this
up by a list of mostly Hijazi tribes that do have nāʔa and rāʔa however: for
Hawāzin among its branch of the Saʕd b. Bakr, the Banū Kinānah, Huḏayl and
many of the Medinans (specifically the ʔanṣār). He adds that in the faʕaltu
form this metathesis does not take place and they say raʔaytu and naʔaytu.
This is indeed in line with what we see in the qct where suffixed forms of
rāʔa ‘to see’ are usually spelledرايتand occasionallyريتin early Quranic
manuscripts, pointing to /rāyt/ or /raʔayt/. All the tribes and people mentioned
21
Also read as taʔmurū-niya, tāmurū-niya (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, 4091). Ibn ʕāmir reads taʔmurūna-
nī, following the Syrian rasmتامروننى
(Sidky 2021).

Almost universally read with labialization of the first n, but ʔabū Ǧaʕfar reads tāman-nā

Also read as makkana-nī by Ibn Kaṯīr (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1208).This is also reported as a rasm
variant for the Meccan rasm (Sidky 2021).

are situated in or around the Hijaz, and thus this feature is clearly Hijazi,
although strikingly explicitly denied to be Qurashi.
5.12
Lexical Isoglosses
Besides some of the generalizable phonological details as discussed on the sec-
tions above, al-Farrāʔ in his Luġāt al-Qurʔān lists many isoglosses of specific
lexical items, which represent certain differences in vocalization or metathe-
sis. These cannot always be confidently be seen as the result of a regular sound
law, and some certainly reflect the outcome of some irregular shift. Neverthe-
less, such forms can be compared against the qct, to see to what extent they
support a dialectal identification. Whenever the qct allows us to distinguish
such lexical isoglosses, it invariably points towards the Hijazi form.
This is significant, as this is not at all what we find among the reading tradi-
tions when the qct is ambiguous. Even in such cases the readings quite often
agree with the form attributed to the Hijaz, but far from always. In other words,
the Quranic readers did not feel forced to stick to what was believed to be the
Hijazi/Qurashi forms (see §3.4). But when the rasm leaves no other choice, the
readers fall in line, and as a result end up having the Hijazi form. This is strong
evidence of the Hijazi character of the qct. The following list gives examples
of forms cited by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt). After each option the tribal attribution is
given in brackets, followed by the page number where the isogloss is discussed.
Finally, the qct form is listed. While it is not possible to define more specific
sound laws for these isoglosses, I have categorized them into several general
types.

In fact, also the masculine elative retains a trace of the root final consonant *w, as it
is spelledاقصا
/ʔaqṣā/ with the regular outcome of Proto-Arabic *ʔaqṣawu, rather than
**اقصى
/ʔaqṣē/ (van Putten 2017a, 60). This is not commented on by the Arab grammari-
ans, as they do not distinguish between the two etymologically distinct ʔalif maqṣūrahs.
27
One might wonder how to understand this statement of al-Farrāʔ in light of the fact that
hamzah has been lost in the Quran. But ii-ʔ verbs remain distinct from ii-w/y verbs mor-
phologically, even though it is likely the aʔa sequence had shifted to ā, e.g. saʔalta > /sālta/
but, e.g. kunta > /kunt/.
28
One wonders whether this description of the Tamīmī form is intended to designate the
voiced post-alveolar fricative pronunciation of the ǧīm as is common in many Levantine
Arabic dialects today. But there is no way to be certain.

As this list illustrates, the qct invariably has the Hijazi or Qurashi form. In Al-
Farrāʔ’s list I have identified one case where the qct gives a mixed answer and
both reported dialectal forms are attested. One must keep in mind in this case
that al-Farrāʔ’s wording is seldomly explicitly exclusive. Just because a certain
form occurs in the Hijaz, while another form occurs elsewhere need not mean
that one or the other did not have both. The example I have found is the fol-
lowing:
– ʔamalla ‘to dictate’ (Hijaz, ʔasad), ʔamlā (Tamīm, Qays), p. 41. As al-Farrāʔ
points out, the qct has both:تملى
‘they are dictated’ (Q25:5),وليملل
‘so let him
dictate’ (Q2:282).29
There is one more example where the qct seems to have both forms reported.
Hijazis treat ṭaġā ‘to overflow’ as a iii-w verb, while some of the Tamīm treat
it as a iii-y verb (al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 143). The qct has both forms, but seemingly
with a semantic distinction.طغى
/ṭaġē/ ‘he transgressed’ (Q20:24, 43; Q53:17;
Q79:17, 37) andطغا
/ṭaġā/ ‘it overflowed’ (Q69:11). Van Putten (2017a, 60f.)
argues that the meaning ‘to overflow’ is the original inherited word, whereas
‘to transgress’ is borrowed from Aramaic, with its treatment as a iii-y verbs
borrowed along with it. While these two verbs are often taken to be the same
verb (e.g. Diem 1979, 239), and thus the spelling with ʔalif as evidence that the
two ʔalif maqṣūrahs denote the same sound, it seems that this may not have
been the case for al-Farrāʔ. Al-Farrāʔ usually cites dialectal variants at their
first appearance in the Quran in his Luġāt al-Qurʔān, but the discussion of
ṭaġā/ṭaġawtu versus ṭaġē/ṭaġaytu does not appear at the first mention of the
verb ṭaġē spelledطغىat Q20:24, but instead at the first and only mention of
its spelling asطغا
(Q69:11) where it means ‘to overflow’. This may perhaps be
taken as an indication that al-Farrāʔ indeed considered these two verbs to be
different, and mentions here that they may merge in Tamīmī.
For these lexical isoglosses, it should be clear that whenever the qct allows
us to identify the dialectal form of the text it consistently sides with Hijazi Ara-
bic. The only exception I have found attests both the Hijazi and the non-Hijazi
dialectal form.
29
Interestingly, al-Farrāʔ also citesواملى لهم
/wa-ʔumlī la-hum/ (Q68:45), now generally
understood with the other meaning of the verb ʔamlā as ‘And I will give them reprieve’.

Phonetic Isoglosses Not Recognized by the Grammarians
There are several phonetic isoglosses in Quranic Arabic that from a compara-
tive perspective clearly set QuranicArabic apart from Proto-Arabicin its ances-
tral stage, but whose features either are not recognized at al by the grammari-
ans, or do not receive an explicit dialectal identification.
5.13.1
Stative ii=iii Are ẓalla/ẓaltu or ẓiltu
While Classical Arabic generally breaks up geminated stative verbs like ẓalla/
ẓaliltu in the suffixed forms, the qct treats these verbs differently from
ẓanna/ẓanantu, and has a biliteral formظلت
(Q20:97),فظلتم
(Q56:65). Rabin
(1951, 163, §aa) suggests that this might be a specifically Hijazi innovation but
this does not seem to be corroborated by the two early grammarians we exam-
ine here. Sibawayh (iv, 421) discusses such forms but just discusses it in ‘their
speech’ as opposed to ẓaliltu forms which he says is ‘your speech’. Al-Farrāʔ
(Luġāt, 93) does not seem to consider the ẓaliltu form at all (though see al-
Farrāʔ Maʕānī, ii, 190). He says ẓalta is the speech of the Arabs, and some of
the Tamīm say ẓilta. The presence of this feature of the qct does not seem to
have been considered specifically Hijazi.
5.13.2
Pausal Shortening of Final -ī
Rabin (1951, 119, §ii) notices that the 1sg suffixes -nī and -ī often appear short-
ened in the qct. In fact, this overwhelmingly occurs in pause (see van Putten
and Stokes 2018, 156–158), but appears to have been optionally available out-
side of pause as well. Moreover, it does not just affect these suffixes but every
single case of word-final -ī in the qct. This feature is suggested by Rabin, and
likewise by Blau (1977, 15) and Nöldeke (1910, 4) to be a colloquialism of the
Meccan dialect. All authors appear to be under the assumption that this fea-
ture is not part of the ʕarabiyyah, but this is not backed up by the comments
of the grammarians—nor are such forms explicitly attributed to the Hijaz by
them.
Sībawayh (iv, 183) reports that indefinite iii-y nouns of the type qāḍin and
ġāzinarenormallypronouncedqāḍ, ġāzinpause,although“someArabswhose
Arabic is to be trusted” say rāmī, ġāzī. But some among the Arabs (no dialect
given) are said to shorten the forms in pause, even for the definite form, thus
al-qāḍin pause for al-qāḍī. No specific example is given, but this is exactly the
The fact that al-Farrāʔ cites it here, suggests he understood this verse to mean ‘And I will
dictate for them.’

type of distribution that we find in the Quran, thusالزانى
‘the adulterer’ (Q24:2)
in context, butبالواد
‘the wadi’ (Q89:9) in pause.
For the verb, Sībawayh (iv, 184f.) considers this an anomalous practice
(šāḏḏ), but does say it occurs, thus you get forms like lā ʔadr for ‘I do not know’,
and he specifically says it is more fit (ʔaǧdar) to do this with nouns (citing the
Quran), but points out that it occurs for verbs at the ends of phrases in the
Quran ( fawāṣil) citing wa-l-layl ʔiḏā yasr# ‘by the night when it passes’ (Q89:4)
and mā kunnā nabġ# ‘what we have been seeking’ (Q18:64).30
For the 1sg. suffixes Sībawayh (iv, 185f.) considers the shortening to be the
more regular and more common practice in pause, citing forms such as hāḏā
ġulām-ø# ‘this is my slave boy’, wa-qad ʔasqā-n# ‘he has given me to drink’. For
these pausal shortenings of -ī, Sībawayh cites no regional preferences and cites
a variety of Quranic verses and lines of poetry.
Al-Farrāʔ (Maʕānī, i, 90) discusses the phenomenon of shortening final -nī
and -ī to -ni and -i respectively, and says that both the retention of length and
the shortening is correct. He does not connect it with pausal pronunciation,
presumably because in the Quran it occurs not infrequently outside of pause
aswell.Headdsthatitiscommontoshortentheseforms,butdoesnotconsider
it specific to the Hijaz or to any eastern tribe, but as a general phenomenon.
So, while this isogloss is certainly part of Quranic Arabic, there does not
seem to be compelling external evidence to connect this feature with the Hijaz.
Its identification as Hijazi is therefore purely based on its appearance in the
qct, this is, of course circular when investigating the linguistic character of
the Quran.
5.13.3
Word-Final āy/w > āʔ
In word-final position, the sequence *āy (and probably also *āw) has shifted to
āʔ in Quranic Arabic. Rhyme suggests that this was one of the few places where
Quranic Arabic retained a reflex of the hamzah (van Putten 2018, 103ff.). Com-
parative evidence with Safaitic shows that this variety of Northern Old Arabic
retained *āy in this positio, e.g. s¹my /samāy/ ‘sky’ and ʾʿrḍy /ʔaʕreṣ́āy/ ‘valleys’.31
It has been suggested by Rabin (1951, 141, §ee) that one of the dialectal
isoglosses between Hijazi Arabic and Najdi Arabic is that Hijazi Arabic has -āʔ
30
Note that apparently to Sībawayh fāṣilah does not just mean ‘end a verse in the Quran’,
but even ‘end of a phrase in the Quran’, as mā kunnā nabġ(i) is not a verse ending in any
regional verse count (Spitaler 1935, 43; al-Dānī 1994, 189).
31
Some dialects in Yemen, like Safaitic, but unlike Quranic Arabic never underwent this
development, and still have -āy in, e.g. samāy (Behnstedt 1987, 59ff.). This is not likely
to be an otherwise unmotivated shift from *ʔ > y, as Behnstedt assumed.

chapter 5
(i.e. ʔalif mamdūdah) as an outcome of *āy, whereas Najdi Arabic has -ā/ē (i.e.
ʔalif maqṣūrah). This isogloss works well for the plural demonstrative which in
Hijazi is hāʔulāʔ(i), and Tamīm, Qays, Bakr have (hā-)ʔulā/ē instead (see §4.4).
But, the evidence of the early grammarians does not give very strong evidence
that Hijazi -āʔ versus Najdi -ā/ē to words other than the demonstrative, how-
ever. Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 18ff.) reports that the Qurayš and those that surround
them, and the people of Najd lengthen nouns of the type bināʔan, whereas
some Arabs shortened it (i.e. binan). He adds that some of Qays say ʔinšāyan
and bināyan, retaining (at least in this context) the original *y consonant. He
adds that he does not approve of shortening forms like bināʔan and māʔan to
binan and man “because it mixes up the lengthened (i.e. nouns that end in -āʔ)
and the shortened (i.e. nouns that ends in -ā/an).”
He also discussesانيهʔinā-hu, ʔinē-hu ‘the extent of it’ (Q33:53), mentioning
that it is a widespread Qurašī practice, while (other) people of the Hijaz, Najd
andHuḏaylsayʔinywhereassomeArabssaysʔanāʔ instead.Heretheʔalif maq-
ṣūrah form is specifically connected with the Qurayš, but the lengthened form
not with any specific tribe (al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 117).
Forبسيمهم
‘by their mark’ al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 41) reports for bi-sīmā-hum for
the Quraysh while ‘another practice’ is bi-sīmāʔi-him and that Ṯaqīf and some
of al-ʔasd (= al-ʔazd?) say bi-sīmyāʔi-him.
There can be no doubt that the language of the qct retained a distinction
between the ʔalif mamdūdah and ʔalif maqṣūrah, yet the evidence in favour of
a geographical split remains sparse, and conflicting.
5.13.4
Pharyngealization of the Emphatics
In the pre-Islamic Graeco-Arabica of the southern Levant, presumably reflec-
tive of the local dialect of Nabataean Arabic, the emphatic consonants ḍand ẓ
are represented with σ and τ respectively. These transcriptions certainly point
to unvoiced realizations, which suggests that they may have still been ejectives
(which cannot be voiced). Moreover,the lack of anyeffect of the emphatic con-
sonants on the surrounding vowels, seems to further corroborate that they are
ejectives rather than pharyngealized consonants (Al-Jallad 2017a, 128).
While it is not possible to tell from the qct whether these emphatic conso-
nants were voiced or not, it is clear from the spreading effect that the emphatic
consonants have on surrounding consonants that they were pharyngealized,
as ejectives are typically non-spreading (van Putten 2019b). This is a specific
development of Quranic Arabic as opposed to the northern dialects, and gets
describedforArabicmoregenerallybytheArabgrammarians.Nospecificmen-
tion seems to be made of ejective realizations, which may have largely fallen
out of use by the time the Arab grammarians were active.

5.14
The Quran Is Phonologically Hijazi
As with the morphological features of Quranic Arabic, the phonetic features
likewise give a clear picture: Whenever the qct allows us to examine the pho-
netic features of the language of the Quran, it quite consistently points in the
direction of the Hijaz. Only occasionally the data of the Arab grammarians
does not agree with the attested data, most notably with the treatment of the
word-final /ē/. In this case, a plausible case can be made that Quranic Arabic
is archaic in this regard and the descriptions of the grammarians might sim-
ply be an inaccurate reflection of early first century ah Arabic because by the
late second century Hijazi Arabic had lost this phoneme. The table below once
again lists the features found in the Quran and to which tribe they have been
attributed by the grammarians. Likewise, it is shown which innovations can be
shown to have not taken place in Northern Old Arabic. Once again, we find that
the qct overwhelmingly points to the Hijaz in terms of its phonetic features,
and that many of those features are absent in Northern Old Arabic varieties.

5.15
Conclusion
In this and the previous chapter we have examined the morphological and
phonological isoglosses of the language of the Quran, not as it is presented
by the—often conflicting—reading traditions, but as it is reflected by the only
partof thetextthatcertainlyexistedintheverybeginningof theIslamicperiod,
the Quranic Consonantal Text.
Very different from the view we get if we would take any one of the reading
traditions,averyconsistentpictureemerges:Allitsfeaturesalignwithwhatthe
early Arab grammarians identify as Hijazi Arabic. I believe that this evidence
should be taken seriously. There is no positive evidence at all that the Quran
was composed in an intertribal poetic koiné whose features remain undefined
by those that have advocated such a position. Instead, it seems best to consider
the Quran to be composed in the native dialect of the audience it was origi-
nally addressed to, that is, the local dialect of Mecca and likely also Medina.
This should be seen as strong, and independent, evidence for the location in
which the Quran took its form, namely: the Hijaz.32
Takingthelanguageof theQurantobeidenticalwiththeHijazivernacularis
something that will strike many readers as familiar. After all, this has been the
position of many classical Muslim authors on the one hand, and Karl Vollers
(1906) on the other. It is worth exploring here how the current view should be
seen in light of these views.
First, Vollers work should be seen in the context in which it was written. He
advocated that the Quran was originally composed in the Hijazi vernacular,
which he considered to be considerably closer to the features many modern
dialects have today; he argued for a complete absence of the case system for
example. To his mind, grammarians later ‘upgraded’ the text to be in line with
Classical Arabic. This perspective now may strike us as flagrantly ahistorical—
32
Linguistically,Durie’s(2018,16f.)suggestionforthelocationof theQuran’sdialectbeingin
the Southern Levant is untenable. While Durie mostly correctly identifies several features
of Quranic Arabic as also occurring either in Nabataean Arabic or in Safaitic, he brings
no evidence that those take place in the Southern Levant to the exclusion of the Hijaz.
The argument at best can therefore only serve as opening the possibility that the Quran
is from either the Southern levant or the Hijaz. However, a more detailed analysis shows
that the Southern Levantine option is less attractive, as Durie mixes freely linguistic fea-
tures of distinct dialects of Arabic, and ignores clear isoglosses present in Quranic Arabic
completely absent in the Southern Levant. Therefore, contrary to his claim, the linguistic
evidence rather speaks in favour of the traditional narrative of the origin of the Quran,
and speaks against more exotic suggestions that place the origins of the Quran in Petra or
elsewhere in the Nabataean realm.

it is clear that the text of the Quran was standardized long before the first
grammarians became active, any reworking that requires a wholesale rework-
ing of the rasm—which his work does—must be discarded.
However, Vollers’ confusion about these facts in the beginning of the 20th
century can hardly be considered entirely his fault. At the time, access to early
Quranicmanuscriptswasalmostnon-existent,andinfactevenaccesstoaprint
Quran that attempted to reproduce the Uthmanic rasm was not available. He
thereforeworkedwiththeFlügelQuranof 1834,andindeedif oneexaminesthis
text carefully and compares it against the reports of the Arabic grammarians
and qirāʔāt works one gets a strong impression that the text has been reworked
towards a classical standard. The Flügel Quran has fully classicized spelling in
keeping with the presumably Ottoman exemplar that was used for producing
this print edition. Thus, all cases of ā are spelled plene, the ʔalif maqṣūrah of
iii-yverbsbeforepronominalcliticsisspelledwithʔalif,not yāʔ,andevenpost-
consonantal hamzah is spelled with an ʔalif, such as in yasʔalūna-ka asَكَ نوُ لَأْسَ ي
,
rather than the qct’sيسلونك
.Indeed, the Quranic text had been reworked, but
much later than Vollers himself imagined.
Further examples of Classicization in the Flügel Quran can be found in its
representation of the reading tradition as well. While the Flügel Quran largely
follows the reading of Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim many of the typical non-classical fea-
tures of that reading had been edited out by Flügel. Thus Hafṣ’ typical kufuwan
and huzuwan instead of kufuʔan and huzuʔan have been systematically ‘clas-
sicized’ by Flügel asكُفُؤًاandهُز ُؤًا
.Vollers (1906, 85) thus found that the Hijazi
readings kufuwan and huzuwan had been edited out of the text. Many other
typical features of Ḥafṣ’ reading have been edited out of the text, thus ʔansānī-
hu and ʕalay-hu ḷḷāh—both likewise Hijazi readings—have been classicized
to ʔansānī-hi and ʕalay-hi llāh respectively. The Quranic text therefore was
reworked, but not by the Arab grammarians but by a German orientalist.
Regardless of these issues in Vollers’ work, the massive amount of disagree-
ment between the Quranic readings on all kinds of forms, between the readers
should have made his contemporaries aware that they did not know what the
truelanguageof theQuranwas,anditistohiscreditthathetriedtoanswerthis
question. Moreover, reworking by the early Arabic readers can be uncovered
through careful examination of the reading traditions, this will be discussed in
more detail in the next two chapters.
Besides Vollers, also the medieval Muslim philologists seem to have consid-
ered the language of the Quran to be Hijazi. These statements—and especially
those of al-Farrāʔ, as presented in a translation by Kahle (1947, 79f.)—that pro-

being Qurashi to be pious fabrications, as these scholars take it for granted that
the language of the Quran was the ‘poetic koiné’ and not the dialect of the
Qurayš. Thus, Rabin (1955, 26) says “had the Koran been composed in either
the dialect of Quraish or in a “vulgar tongue”, no amount of revision without
altering the consonant outlines could have made it as similar to Classical [Ara-
bic] as it is.”33
Zwettler (1978, 112) commenting on al-Farrāʔ’s explanation why the Qurashi
dialect is the most correct says that “al-Farrāʾ has evoked here a fairly superfi-
cial picture of the classical ʿarabīya (though, of course, not of the actual dialect
of Qurayš)”. Zwettler is commenting here on a tradition brought by al-Farrāʔ
translated by Kahle of ʕumar b. al-Xaṭṭāb writing to ibn Masʕūd (admonish-
ing him to never say ʕattā ḥīna instead of ḥattā ḥina again): “The Koran came
down in the language of the Ḳuraish and it came not down in the language of
the Hudhail. So, do you teach men to recite it in the language of the Ḳuraish
and not in the language of Hudhail.” Here the central view that the Quranic
language is Qurashi is already found at the earliest possible date that we can
expect to encounter it, with the second earliest grammarian whose works have
come down to us.
Such commentaries have often been seen as a “dogma which equated the
literary language with the Quraish dialect” (Rabin 1951, 21), but those familiar
with the work of al-Farrāʔ should immediately see a problem with asserting
the existence of such a dogma with this author. While al-Farrāʔ may have been
in the business of extolling the qualities of the Qurayš dialect, from his work
it should be obvious that this by no means meant that the Quran could only
be read in the dialect of Qurayš, or that he equated the literary language he
or his teachers used for recitation to the dialect of Qurayš. Al-Farrāʔ frequently
discusses and approves of forms that are explicitly non-Qurashi even for recita-
tion of the Quran (as we saw in chapter 3). He even transmits readings that
by his standards are clearly non-Hijazi. One explicit example is that al-Farrāʔ
(Luġāt) reports that wariq is the Hijazi form, whereas warq is the Tamimi form
and that al-ʔaʕmaš and ʕāṣim read the Tamimi form bi-warqi-kum (Q18:19) and
not the Hijazi form bi-wariqi-kum.34This is presented as self-evident fact which
required no explanation or apology.
The statement that the Quran was sent down in the dialect of Qurayš there-
fore should not be taken as a pious fabrication, nor should it be seen as a reflec-
tion of a dogma that equates the dialect of Qurayš to the ‘poetic koiné’/classical
33
nb since Classical Arabic remains completely undefined, this statement is untestable.
34
Indeed, Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim, of whom al-Farrāʔ is a transmitter reads it thus (Ibn Muǧāhid,
389).

Classicized Hijazi: imposition of the hamzah

6.1
Introduction
In 2020, Ahmad Al-Jallad put forward the bold hypothesis that Classical Arabic
as we know it today is not a single linguistic system but rather the outcome of
a complex interaction between Old Hijazi, i.e. the language of the Quran and
early Islamic Arabic on the one hand and the poetic register of the Qaṣīdahs
of the Maʕaddites on the other (Al-Jallad 2020b, 69ff.). This suggestion is very
much in line with what we have argued for so far in the previous chapters and
previous studies (van Putten 2017a; 2017c; 2018; 2019b; van Putten and Stokes
2018).
While Quran today is read with a certain amount of linguistic variation,
these reading traditions, despite their variation still agree on several central
features such as the retention of the *ʔ (in most environments), and a full case
inflectionwithfinalshortvowelsandtanwīnbothof whichappeartohavebeen
absent in the original form of Quranic Arabic as reflected by the qct. To get
from the language of the qct to the language(s) used in recitation, this lan-
guage has to have been ‘classicized’ over time. This claim will, of course, bring
to mind the work of Karl Vollers (1906), who famously claimed that the Quran
was composed in the Hijazi vernacular and only later reworked by the Arab
grammarians towards Classical Arabic. His hypothesis was criticized by many,
and few authors have taken his book particularly seriously but even fewer have
seriously answered his arguments in a coherent way.
Vollers (1906, §39–43) considered the original Hijazi vernacular—and by
extension the language of the Quran—to have lacked all forms of case inflec-
tion.Thisisnotinkeepingwiththeprimarysourcematerial.Firstof all,theqct

2021; Sinai 2014a; 2014b; van Putten 2019c). This is clearly before the develop-
ment of grammatical theory, and reworking of the text by Arab grammarians
towards a literary standard which gets established by the Arab grammarians
over a century later is chronologically no longer defensible. Much of his argu-
mentation requires us to assume that the consonantal text was changed in the
decadesafter650ce.Withthisnewmaterialevidence,thispartof hisargumen-
tation has lost most of its explanatory power. Likewise, evidence adduced from
canonical and non-canonical readings alike only tells us something about the
linguistic variation that was considered acceptable as part of the ʕarabiyyah,
and nothing about the language of the Quran itself as it is reflected in the qct.
The only argument that relies on the rhyme of the Quran is his argument for
the absence of the indefinite accusative (§42). He suggests that the indefinite
accusative ending was invisible to rhyme, but this is clearly not the case and
the presence of this vowel is in fact essential for the choice between certain
otherwise identical formulae (e.g.ان الله عليم حكيمversusان الله كان عليما حكيما
,
see van Putten and Stokes 2018, 145f.). Any expression of case that is explicitly
present in the qct is certainly part of the language that the qct was written
down in, and likely (and sometimes demonstrably so) present in the language
of the original composition as evidenced by the rhyme.
However, those arguing against Vollers have frequently taken the argument
to the opposite extreme: any sign of any case at all must mean that Quranic
Arabic had full case inflection exactly how the Arab grammarians present it,
with full case/mood inflection and tanwīn. But this conclusion is not borne
out by the evidence either. Between a stage of full case inflection, which must
certainly be reconstructed for Proto-Arabic (Al-Jallad and Putten 2017), and no
caseatall,theremustbeawholespectrumof casesystemsthatwereinthepro-
cess of losing it. Already in the pre-Islamic period there were clearly varieties
that had lost their case inflection to various degrees.
While the loss of case and mood has often been seen as a catastrophic event
that very rapidly, or instantly changed the language from its Old Arabic stages
to its Neo-Arabic stage (e.g. Ferguson 1959; Blau 1977; Versteegh 1984), discover-
ies of the past decades in Arabic dialectology and especially of recent years in
Old Arabic epigraphy have made it clear that such a simplified scenario cannot
account for the variation that we see. Safaitic, for example, seems to have only
marked the accusative case, while not marking tanwīn at all, centuries before
the rise of Islam (Al-Jallad 2015, 69). Also, the case system of Nabataean Ara-
bic, lacks tanwīn in the earliest period but still seems to have a tripartite case
inflection. Only later this case distinction seems to be lost, exchanged with
an invariable ⟨-w⟩(“wawation”)—a trace of the original nominative (Al-Jallad

psalm fragment is almost completely on its way out, despite being written
around the same time as the activities of the early Arab grammarians (Al-Jallad
2020b). However, if we would follow the indications of the Arab grammarians,
we would never know such varieties existed at all, as these clearly fell outside
of their normative framework of proper Arabic.
It is now clear that certain forms of pre-Islamic Arabic with clearly archaic
features—often more archaic than what we find in Classical Arabic—existed
which, nevertheless had a different and frequently more reduced ʔiʕrāb/tan-
wīn system than Classical Arabic. It is therefore not a given that this system,
whose linguistic reality is proven by the rhyme and meter in pre-Islamic poetry,
could be imposed onto the language of the Quran, even if it is present in all the
Quranic reading traditions.
Van Putten & Stokes (2018) argued that the Quran did not completely lack
the Proto-Arabic case system as Vollers suggests, but rather had a transitional
system where final short vowels and nunation had been lost (where an had
become ā). Case expressed by long vowels was generally retained, as well
as case vowels for nouns in construct. In other words, we have argued and
adduced evidence that case was only retained in places where the qct actu-
ally reflects it. Examples usually invoked to prove that the case system must
have operated, tend to not counter such a system particularly well. In counter-
ing Vollers’ suggestion, for example Fück (1950, 2) cites the following examples
which he considered ambiguous had case been lost. All of the examples would
be unambiguous in the case system that Van Putten & Stokes reconstruct. The
examples of Fück are given below along with the likely form they may have
taken in Quranic Arabic as I would reconstruct it:
انما يخشى الله من عباده العلموا
/innamā yaxšē ḷḷāh min ʕibādi-h al-ʕulamō1/
(Q35:28)
‘Only the knowledgeable among his servants fear God’
واذا حضر القسمه اولوا القوربى
/wa-iḏā ḥaḍar al-qismah ulū l-qurbē/ (Q4:8)
‘And when relatives, at the time of division, are present’
1 The interpretation of the final wāw-ʔalif sequence in what in Classical Arabic is pronounced
al-ʕulamāʔu remains somewhat difficult to determine. It seems fairly clear that it does not
represent āwu or āw. ō seems like a reasonable option. See Appendix A.2.3.6 for a discussion.

ان الله برى من المشركين ورسوله
/anna ḷḷāh bariyy min al-mušrikīna wa-rasū-
lu-h/ (Q9:3)
‘That God is free from the idolaters, as is his messenger’
واذ ابتلى ابرهم ربه
/wa-iḏibtalē ibrāhām rabbu-h/ (Q2:124)
‘And when his lord tried Abraham’
The first two of these are in fact distinguished by the rasm, and certainly did
not present any problem to the understanding. The other two would not be
ambiguous if, as we have argued, case vowels had been retained in construct.
One should note, however, that even if such phrases would be fully ambiguous,
pragmatically such phrases hardly ever pose true ambiguity—it is unlikely that
anyone would think that it is God who fears the servant in Q35:28, for exam-
ple. The very fact that Classical Arabic writing manages to communicate the
intended meanings with a writing system that generally does not express case,
should make it clear that such ambiguities can be resolved to a large extent
through pragmatic considerations.
Moreover, many extra-linguistic hints such as intonation and pause, which
are likely to have played a role in the original composition of the Quran, are sys-
tematically erased almost completely in Quranic recitation. These too would
have helped with the resolution of ambiguities, even with a strongly reduced
case system. It is therefore difficult to accept unusual word order to hold much
weight as an argument for a full case system, and evidence for its presence or
absence needs to be found elsewhere.
Starting from the linguistic situation where *ʔ and final short vowels and
nunation were lost completely, one would naturally expect that at times the
Quran had been imperfectly classicized towards a variety that did have these
features. It has, on multiple occasions, been claimed that the Quran cannot
have been classicized for the exact reason that there are no such traces of
imperfect classicization, as exemplified, for example by Blau saying that “the
total lack of Neoarabic and pseudo-correct features in the Koran establishes
a linguistic situation in which the differences between the literary and spoken
language could not have been too far-reaching” (Blau 1977, 15). I agree with Blau
that the Arabic of the Quran was probably close to the vernacular of the Hijaz,
and that little to no reworking has been undertaken on the consonantal text.
However, this implies that the language of the Quran did not have hamzah, and
indeed that it had a reduced case/tanwīn system. Blau seems to admit the pos-
sibility that Quranic Arabic had a somewhat reduced system that had lost (at

least) word final -i (pg. 15f.), but does not commit to a strong opinion on what
this system may have looked like.
However, we frequently find evidence in the Quranic reading traditions that
these texts have been grammatically reworked by its reciters. Pseudo-correct
features that clearly point to conscious and artificial tampering with the lan-
guage of recitation frequently appears in them. In fact, Vollers found many
examples of this in his magnum opus, although many of his critics seem to
havemissedthesepoints,andhaveratherchosentoattackhisadmittedlymuch
weaker argumentation in favour of his ‘caseless Quran’.
AsIseeit,therearethreemainsystematicfeaturesthatdifferentiateQuranic
Arabic as it can be reconstructed from the qct, and how it appears in the
Quranic reading traditions. The first, and the most widely admitted differ-
ence is that Quranic Arabic seems to have lost the hamzah entirely, something
that is obvious from the orthography and can be clearly demonstrated from
Quranic rhyme (van Putten 2018). In this chapter we will show that the pattern
of both the pseudocorrect presence and absence of hamzah frequently occurs
in the Quranic readings, clearly showing that later philologists have inserted
the hamzah into the recitation of the Quran and were not always successful in
doing so with regard to the placement that would be expected from its etymol-
ogy.
The second feature, is the quintessentially Classical Arabic feature, namely
the system of ʔiʕrāb and tanwīn, which the language of the qct appears to
have largely lost (van Putten and Stokes 2018). In chapter 7, I will show that
to the Quranic reciters, placement of ʔiʕrāb and tanwīn was a highly theoret-
ical undertaking, not one that unambiguously stemmed from its prototypical
recitation and composition. Within this theoretical framework, there are also
occasional cases where the reciters fail to fully apply the final short vowels in
a manner that would be expected, yielding forms without final short vowels,
where we would have expected them.

I will therefore not discuss this feature in more detail in these chapters.
6.2
Pseudocorrect Hamzah
In §5.2 and Van Putten (2018) we have argued that the language of the qct
lacked a hamzah altogether and that the reading traditions eventually classi-
cized Quranic Arabic. Van Putten (2018, 98–101) showed already that the read-
ing traditions treat the hamzah rather inconsistently. In phonetically identical
environments sometimes the hamzah is lost while other times it is not, occa-
sionally based on grammaticalprinciples, other times seemingly byrhyme.The
fact that the Quranic readings fail to undergo regular sound changes clearly
suggests that the readings are not natural language, but rather a mixed literary
register (see §3.3).
Evidence for a transition from a Hijazi hamzah-less pronunciation of the
Quran, as confirmed by the rhyme and orthography, towards a more classical
system can be seen by the presence of pseudocorrection of the hamzah in the
Quranic reading traditions. Indeed, we would expect to see the application of
hamzah where it should have never appeared etymologically, and likewise fail-
ure to insert the hamzah where we would etymologically expect it. Cases of
both types of pseudocrrection can indeed be found in the reading traditions
(as well as in Classical Arabic). This is a strong indication that Quranic Arabic
originally lacked the hamzah and that it was only later artificially inserted, as it
became fashionable for proper Arabic to have a hamzah.
There appears to be a historical memory of this transition taking place in the
beginning of the second Islamic century, at least for Medina, as Ibn Muǧāhid
(60) reports that Qālūn said: kānaʔahlul-madīnati lāyahmizūnaḥattāhamaza
bnuǧundabin,fa-hamazūmustahziʔūna,wa-stahziʔ “ThepeoplefromMadīnah
used to not apply the hamzah until [Muslim] Ibn Ǧundab (d. 130ah/747ah)
applied the hamzah. From then on they applied the hamzah to mustahziʔūna
and istahziʔ”2
2 See also al-Ḏahabī (i, 59); Ibn al-Ǧazarī (al-Ġāyah, ii, 260).

6.3
Hamzah among the Quranic Readers
Before we discuss the cases of pseudocorrect hamzah it is worth discussing the
generalizable treatment of the hamzah in the different canonical reading tra-
ditions, as this way we are better able to appreciate the instances when readers
deviate not just from the imagined classical Arabic norm, but also from their
own norms.
The majority of the Quranic readers regularly retain the hamzah in most
environments. Readers such as ʕāṣim, Ibn Ḏakwān ʕan ibn ʕāmir, Qālūn ʕan
Nāfiʕ, Ibn Kaṯīr, al-Kisāʔī, Xalaf and Yaʕqūb by and large retain the hamzah in
all positions. That is: in pre-consonantal position, post-consonantal position
and in intervocalic positions. The only position where all readers agree that
etymological hamzah is to be dropped is in sequences of two hamzahs, where
the first one is followed by a vowel and the second by a consonant, within a
single word, e.g. ʔaʔmuru-hū →ʔāmuru-hū ‘I order him’ (Q12:32).
The remaining readers adhere to several general principles of the dropping
of the hamzah. In the following discussion we will only discuss cases of pseu-
docorrect hamzah that cannot be explained by the general rules of the read-
ings.
ʔabū Ǧaʕfar drops each pre-consonantal hamzah, with compensatory
lengthening, e.g. muʔminūna →mūminūna, šiʔta →šīta, yaʔkulu →yākulu. He
likewisedoesthesameforword-finalvowel+ʔsequences:iqraʔ→iqrā,nabbiʔ→
nabbī (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1466). Besides this he also regularly shifts the sequences
iʔūna, iʔīna and iʔū to ūna and ī(na) respectively, e.g. mustahzūna (Q2:14;
Q15:95), ʔa-tunabbūna (Q10:18), muttakūna (Q36:56), fa-mālūna (Q37:66; Q56:
53), al-munšūna (Q56:72), al-xāṭūna (Q69:37), al-xāṭīna (Q12:29, 91, 97), al-
mustahzīna (Q15:95), muttakīna (Q18:31), yuṭfū (Q9:32). He has a single excep-
tion to this: xāsiʔīna (Q2:65; Q7:166) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1496). He would also drop
the hamzah whenever it stood in the sequence uʔa, where ʔ was the first root
consonant, e.g. yuʔaddihī →yuwaddihī, yuʔāxiḏu →yuwāxiḏu (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§1485).
ʔabū ʕamr has the option to drop prescononsantal hamzah, or to conserva-
tivelykeepit(Ibnal-Ǧazarī,§1472–1474).However,evenwiththeoptiontodrop
the hamzah, ʔabū ʕamr would not drop it if hamzah was root-final, and in the
apocopate or imperative. This is not just in word-final position such as našaʔ
and tasuʔ, but also on morpheme boundaries such as ʔanbiʔ-hum and ʔarǧiʔ-
hu, where the hamzah is pre-consonantal within the same word (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§1475).
Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ has two main treatments. In the transmission path of al-
ʔazraq the rule is that Warš drops pre-consonantal and intervocalic hamzah,

but only if it is the first root consonant. Hence: muʔminun →mūminun and
yaʔxiḏu→yāxiḏu,and yuʔaxxiru→yuwaxxirubutnotbiʔsa,ǧiʔta,or yašaʔ (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §1471).
The other path of transmission of Warš, that of al-ʔaṣbahānī, has a princi-
ple that is closer to that of ʔabū Ǧaʕfar. He drops any preconsonantal hamzah,
regardless of the position in the root. He, however, has a list of exceptions to
this general rule, causing him to retain significantly more hamzahs than ʔabū
Ǧaʕfar.These exceptions are: baʔs, baʔsāʔ, (al)-luʔluʔ, riʔyan, kaʔs, ar-raʔs, ǧiʔta
(and other forms of the verb such as ǧiʔnā-hum), nabbiʔ (and other apoco-
pates derive from that root), qaraʔta (and other suffixed forms of the verb);
hayyiʔ/yuhayyiʔandtuʔwī/tuʔwī-hi(Ibnal-Ǧazarī,§1469).LikeWaršinthepath
of al-ʔazraq, he alsodropsanyword-internalintervocalic hamzah whenit is the
first root consonant (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1485).
Both transmissions of Warš are in agreement that post-consonantal hamzah
is dropped if there is a word boundary between the word-final consonant and
the next word, or if the word preceding the hamzah is the definite article.Thus,
qad ʔaflaḥa →qadaflaḥa and al-ʔarḍu →alarḍu (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1541).
Ḥamzah and Hišām ʕan ibn ʕāmir both have conservative hamzah treat-
ment, but make a special exception in pause. Hišām drops all word final
hamzahs in pause (after dropping the final short vowels), whereas Ḥamzah
drops all hamzahs in pause. That is, words like yaʔkulu, yasʔalu, al-luʔluʔi, as-
samāʔu and al-ʔarḍu would be pronounces yākul, yasal, as-samā,3 al-lūlū and
alarḍin pause (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1541).
6.4
Pseudocorrect Presence of Hamzah
In several cases throughout the Quran, we find examples where readers have a
hamzah where clearly none was ever present etymologically. Such pseudocor-
rections fall into three types. First, some words can be shown to behave irreg-
ularly within the system of the ʕarabiyyah in the appearance of the hamzah.
Second,somewordsareloanwordsfromHebreworAramaicwherethehamzah
is absent, but has been inserted into the Arabic form. Finally, there are several
inherited Semitic words which on comparative Semitic grounds can be shown
to have never had a hamzah in their stem but have acquired them in the read-
ings.

6.4.1
Ḍiyāʔ →ḍiʔāʔ
Qunbul ʕan Ibn Kaṯīr pronounces the verbal noun of ḍāʔa (√ḍwʔ) not as ḍiyāʔ,
asonewouldexpectfora fiʕālpatternof sucharoot,butasḍiʔāʔ (Ibnal-Ǧazarī
§1534). This is clearly pseudocorrect: the root consonant w (which appears in
the also Quranic ḍawʔ) is simply expected to shift to y after i (for example ii-
w roots with CiCāC plural like, diyār ‘dwellings’, or verbal nouns like qiyāmah
‘resurrection’).4
Ibn Muǧāhid (323), who was a direct student of Qunbul, was clearly both-
ered by this reading. He reports that Ibn Kaṯīr read it as such and that that is
how he learned it fromQunbul. However,he brings transmissions of not just al-
Bazzī, one of the transmitters he also reports in his discussion of his ʔisnāds of
Ibn Kaṯīr but also Ibn Fulayḥ, that they rejected the reading and that Ibn Kaṯīr
only read with one hamzah. He discusses this word again at Q28:71, where Ibn
Muǧāhid (495) says: “Only Ibn Kāṯīr read bi-ḍiʔāʔin with two hamzahs. And I
learned it thus from Qunbul, but he was wrong (ġalaṭa).”5
6.4.2
Mūṣadah →muʔṣadah
The C-stem passive participle written asموصده
‘closed’ (Q90:20; Q104:8) is read
by the majority of the readers as mūṣadah. However, Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim, ʔabū ʕamr
and Ḥamzah read it as muʔṣadah (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1484). This variant is a clear
pseudocorrection.Theverbʔawṣada‘toclose’(√wṣd)isalsorecordedasʔāṣada
(√ʔṣd) in classical lexicons, but within the qct the verb clearly has √wṣd as its
root, as is confirmed by waṣīd ‘threshold, doorstep’ derived from the same root
and also attested in the Quranالوصيد
(Q18:18). As the root is √wṣd in Quranic
Arabic, mūṣadah is the expected form and muʔṣadah the pseudocorrection
resulting from the ambiguity of the hamzah-less Quranic Arabic, where C-stem
participles (and imperfect) of I-ʔ regularly merge with I-w roots.
This pseudocorrection did not go unnoticed by classical authors either. Al-
Zamaxšarī (d. 538ah/1144ce) in his al-Kaššāf (iv, 257) brings a report (without
ʔisnād) on the authority of Šuʕbah—who read mūṣadah—saying: “our Imam
[i.e. ʕāṣim] would apply the hamzah toموصده
;and I wanted to plug my ears
whenever I would hear it.” This story may be apocryphal, designed to explain
the difference between Ḥafṣand Šuʕbah in their transmission of ʕāṣim. Nev-
ertheless, it highlights that clearly this reading was disturbing enough to the
grammarian and theologian al-Zamaxšarī, that it was worth relating it.
4 Vollers (1906, 95) sees the hamzah as the transitional stage between an original *ḍiwāʔ and
the form ḍiyāʔ. There is no reason to assume nor is there evidence that such a transitional
stage took place.
5 This line is missing in the first edition of this text, but the third edition has this line added.

159
The confusion between I-ʔ and I-w roots is well-known for the D-, L- and
C-stems in Middle Arabic (Blau 1967, §72.1), and is the result of subsequent
analogies after the loss of the hamzah, which is common to Quranic Arabic and
Middle Arabic alike. This results in a merger of the two root types in the prefix
conjugation and participial derivations. This leads to the frequent appearance
of pairs of I-ʔ and I-w verbs with identical meaning. We find a similar case of
such a development forتوكيدها
‘their affirmation’ (Q16:91), which looks like the
verbal noun of wakkada ‘to affirm’, but Classical Arabic lexicons also record
taʔkīd and ʔakkada with the same meaning. When cognates in other Semitic
languages are lacking, it is often difficult to recover whether the I-ʔ form was
originally a pseudocorrection, or that the I-w is simply a generalized form from
an original I-ʔ verb in a dialect that has lost the hamzah.
6.4.3
Ḍiʔzā
Another case of pseudocorrection in Ibn Kaṯīr’s reading is the wordضيزى
‘most
unfair’ (Q53:22) as he reads it as ḍiʔzā rather than ḍīzā/ḍīzē (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§1484). While this word seems to be basically only known to the Arabic lexi-
cographers and grammariansfromits Quraniccontext,its morphology is trans-
parent: it must be a feminine elative, as there are no other feminine adjectives
that end in ʔalif maqṣūrah. It being an elative, one would expect the pattern to
be CuCCā, had the noun indeed been derived from a root √ḍʔz, then we would
expect ḍuʔzā, not ḍiʔzā, which rather is a pseudocorrect insertion of hamzah
on the vocalic pattern of a √ḍyz root, cf. CAr. ʔaṭyab f. ṭībā ‘better’, CAr. ʔarʔaz
f. ruʔzā ‘more roaring’.6
6.4.4
Manōh →manāʔah
The majority of the readers read the name of the pre-Islamic goddess Manāt
as manāh. But Ibn Kaṯīr reads this as manāʔah. The goddess Manāt is a per-
sonification of Fate, whose name is deribed from the root √mnw alternating
with √mny. This root is well-attested in Pre-Islamic Arabic, the deity Manāt is
spelled mnwt in Nabataean, and the fates are also an often invoked in Safaitic
as mny /manāy/ (Al-Jallad and Jaworska 2019). The insertion of the hamzah by
Ibn Kaṯīr cannot be seen as anything but a pseudocorrect reading.
6 Arabic lexicographers appear to have been aware of the weakness of this reading, as, for
example Lisān (2540c) lists ḍuʔzā first, then ḍūzā (the expected form if one would drop the
hamzah) and only then ḍiʔzā and ḍīzā respectively.

6.4.5
ʕādan l-ʔūlā
Q53:50 contains a unique sequence in the Quran, the only place where a word
ending in tanwīn is followed by the definite article, which is followed by a word
that starts with a hamzah. This sequence yields a cluster of three consonants
/ʕādan l-ʔūlā/, which is resolved differently by different readers (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§1547–1557s). Normally, in the case of a clash of nunation with the definite
article, an epenthetic i is inserted, and that is the reading of the majority of
the canonical readers: [ʕādani l-ʔūlā]. Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ and ʔabū ʕamr, however,
resolve this cluster differently in this specific case. The tanwīn is assimilated to
the lām and the subsequence /llʔ/ is resolved by eliding the glottal stop of the
word, yielding [ʕādal-l-ūlǟ].
Qālūn ʕan Nāfiʕ however, applies yet another development and reads the
[ʕādal-l-uʔlā]. Qālūn must have interpreted the feminine elative as being pho-
nemically /ʔuʔlā/, after the application of the regular development ʔvʔC > ʔv̄C,
as seen for example in *ʔaʔkulu > ʔākulu ‘I eat’, *ʔuʔtiya > ʔūtiya ‘it was given’.
With the loss of the initial hamzah, the second hamzah gets a chance to reap-
pear, a phenomenon we mostly see in imperatives such as ʔīti /(i)ʔti/ but wa-ʔti
/wa-ʔti/.Theproblemhere,however,isthattheinterpretationof ʔūlāas/ʔuʔlā/,
is clearly pseudocorrect due to the inherent ambiguity of the surface form.The
root of this form is √ʔwl, and thus the underlying form is not **/ʔuʔlā/ but
/ʔuwlā/.
6.4.6
Durriyy →du/irrīʔ
كوكب درى
“a brilliant star” (Q24:35) is read by the majority of the readers as
kawkabundurriyy,wherethelatterwordisclearlytobeunderstoodasadenom-
inal adjective of durr ‘pearls’ followed by the nisbah-ending. However, ʔabū
ʕamr and al-Kisāʔī read this word as dirrīʔ and Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim and Ḥamzah
as durrīʔ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3731).
Ibn Xālawayh (ḥujjah, 262) explains that the reading dirrīʔ should be under-
stood as an intensive adjective (like sikkīt ‘intensely silent’) of the root drʔ ‘to
avert; rush out (said of a torrent)’, hence ‘rushing out intensely’ likening the
rushing out to the intensity of the light. This explanation is probably a post
hoc rationalization of a reading with a pseudocorrect hamzah. Ibn Xālawayh
suggests that durrīʔ has the same meaning as dirrīʔ, but fuʕʕīl nouns like this
otherwise do not exist in Arabic, so such an explanation is not particularly con-
vincing.
6.4.7
Maʕāyiš
An interesting point where what is considered correct and what is transmitted
comes into conflict is in the plural of maʕīšah ‘livelihood’, which in the reading

161
traditions today is maʕāyiš (Q7:10, Q15:20). The use of a yāʔ in this case is sur-
prising, other nouns with a similar structure consistently have a hamzah in this
position, e.g. madīnah pl. madāʔin ‘town’; ḥadīqah pl. ḥadāʔiq ‘garden’; xalīfah
pl. xalāʔif ‘successor’; qabīlah pl. qabāʔil ‘tribe’, etc.
The shift of āyi, āwi to āʔi is essentially a regular development, and we find
it not just in the broken plural pattern here, but also active participles of hol-
low roots, e.g. qāʔim ‘standing’, and this development may also be the origin of
word final āʔ such as in samāʔ ‘sky’.7
The only place in Classical Arabic where both *y and *w are retained after
ā and before i is in the verbal system, the L-stems retain the root consonant in
the imperfective, even though the regular development would require a shift to
āʔi. This, however, can be easily explained as the result of analogy. The perfec-
tive form regularly retains the root consonants, and this is simply expanded to
the imperfect, where it would have regularly been lost. This development can
be seen as a three-stage development as follows:
1. Proto-Arabic
2. *āyi, *āwi > āʔi
3. Analogical levelling
qāwama/yuqāwimu
qāwama/yuqāʔimu
qāwama/yuqāʔimu >> yuqāwimu
ʕāyaša/yuʕāyišu
ʕāyaša/yuʕāʔišu
ʕāyaša/yuʕāʔišu >> yuʕāyišu
For the plural maʕāyiš no analogical basis to which the *y could be restored can
be found. As such, maʕāyiš is a deviation from what we would expect a form of
Arabic that underwent the *āyi, *āwi > āʔi shift to produce. It turns out that in
the reading traditions, the form maʕāʔiš is in fact known.8 Ibn Muǧāhid, who
does not usually spend time discussing šāḏḏreadings in his Sabʕahfīal-Qirāʔāt
discusses this form and is curt about it:
7 See Brockelmann (1908, 138f.) for a discussion on this development, which has striking simi-
laritieswithadevelopmentasfoundinAramaic(seealsovanPutten2020a,61).Notehowever
that this development cannot be reconstructed for Proto-Arabic, as varieties of Old Arabic
still retain the glide in such places, e.g. Safaitic s¹my /samāy/ ‘sky’, ḫyṯ/xāyeṯ/ ‘travelling’, gyʿ
/gāyeʕ/‘starving’.Moreover,theshiftdoesnotseemtohavetakeninseveraldialectsof Yemen,

samāʔ, ʔalḥāʔ and ʕamyāʔ) (Behnstedt 1987, 59–61).
8 Vollers (1906, 95) takes the plural maʕāʔiš as a pseudocorrection. Fück (1950, 39f.), rather pre-
scriptively, considers the reading maʕāʔiš a mistake and evidence that there was a lack of a
developed grammatical school in Medina.

The wordمعيش
:All of them read maʕāyiš without the hamzah. But Xāri-
ǧah, on the authority of Nāfiʕ transmits maʕāʔiš with an overlong vowel
and a hamzah. And ʔabū Bakr [ibn Muǧāhid] said: this is a mistake.9
Sadly, Ibn Muǧāhid does not elaborate on why he considers it a mistake. An
answer is found in Sībawayh’s al-Kitāb however, who is in agreement with Ibn
Muǧāhid that this word should not have a hamzah. He argues that, because
this word is derived from a root where the yāʔ is part of the root √ʕyš, this
yāʔ should be retained (Sībawayh, iv, 354–357). Sībawayh is right to observe
that this makes the word objectively different from the other words cited so
far, where the ī of the singular formation is part of the pattern CaCīCah, rather
than part of the root, e.g. madīnah has √mdn10 and ṭarīqah has √ṭrq.
In this argument, Sībawayh is undoubtedly thinking of words such as the
imperfective L-stem verbs such as yuʕāyišu where the root consonant is re-
tained as well. However, we must conclude that this is a post hoc argumenta-
tion. First of all, we cannot assume that speakers of Arabic were themselves
grammarians like Sībawayh, and therefore a sound law that would only apply to
CaCīCahnouns,whentheī happenedtonotbetheresultof arootconsonant,is
not something that is likely to have occurred in natural language, as it requires
a highly abstract model of formal grammatical thinking. Second, the argument
that because the yāʔ is part of the root it could not undergo the *āyi > āʔi shift
clearly breaks downin other derivational forms.The activeparticiple of ‘tolive’,
after all is ʕāʔiš, not ʕāyiš, nor is ‘bird’ ṭāyir, but rather ṭāʔir. Sībawayh’s opinion,
which Ibn Muǧāhid upholds as the status quo, therefore cannot be seen as any-
thing other than rationalization for his choice to prefer maʕāyiš over maʕāʔiš
when he was confronted with the choice between the two.
While later scholars of the qirāʔāt, such as Al-Dānī (ǧāmiʕ, 511), simply fell
in line with Ibn Muǧāhid’s opinion, not all scholars found themselves in agree-
ment with his judgment. ʔabū Ḥayyān al-Andalusī (d. 754ah) in his al-Baḥr
al-Muḥīṭ(v, 15) brings forth a rather spirited argument in favour of maʕāʔiš as
a correct and acceptable reading.11

Note that it is synchronically correct to consider this noun to be from a root √mdn in

classicized hijazi: imposition of the hamzah
163
The general public reads maʕāyiš with the yāʔ, this is an analogy (qiyās),
because the yāʔ in the singular is part of the root, and not an extra let-
ter to the pattern so that it receives a hamzah. When it is an extra letter
of the pattern, they add the hamzah, for example saḥāʔif of ṣaḥīfah. Al-
ʔaʕraǧ and Zayd b. ʕalī and al-ʔaʕmaš and Xāriǧah, on the authority of
Nāfiʕ and Ibn ʕāmir in their (respective) transmission read maʕāʔiš with
a hamz. This is not analogy (qiyās), because they reported it, and they
were trustworthy, so it is necessary to accept it (as a valid reading). This
hamzah is irregular in the same way as it is irregular in manāʔir, the plu-
ral of manārah—it is originally manwarah—and [it is irregular in the
same way as it is irregular] in maṣāʔib, the plural of maṣībah—it is orig-
inally maṣwibah. Manāwir and maṣāwib are analogies as they would say
maṣāwib on the basis of the root, in the same way that they say the plural
of maqāmah as maqāwim; [the plural of] maʕūnah as maʕāwin.
Al-Zaǧǧāǧ said “all of the Basran grammarians decided that adding a
hamzah is a mistake, but I know nothing of this perspective; [I know]
only that [adding hamzah makes] it similar to ṣaḥīfah, ṣaḥāʔif and it is
not proper to rely on this reading [i.e. maʕāʔiš].”
Al-Māzinī said: “The origin of the dispute of this reading is on the
authority of Nāfiʕ, but he did not know what the ʕarabiyyah was, and
the speech of the Arabs [i.e. correct Arabic] is to correct it [i.e. towards
maʕāyiš] in such cases.”
But we are not worshippers of the opinions of the grammarians of
Basra! (lasnā mutaʕabiddīna bi-ʔaqwāli nuḥāti l-baṣrah).
Al-Farrāʔ said: “sometimes the Arabs added a hamzah to this and what
is like it, supposing that it is a faʕīlah, and they liken mafʕilah to faʕī-
lah”.12 So, this is an account from al-Farrāʔ on the authority of the Arabs
that they would sometimes add a hamzah to this and what is like it.
He brought an account of the reading of trustworthy people: Ibn ʕāmir,
he is a pure Arab, and he received the Quran from ʕuṯmān before corrup-
tion [of the Arabic language] manifested itself. As for al-ʔaʕraǧ, he was

is”, this is the evidence for the rebuttal: If we suppose that he did not
know what the ʕarabiyyah was; is it this skill [i.e. knowing what the ʕara-
biyyah is] which gives him access to speaking the language of the Arabs?
He does not have to [know what the ʕarabiyyah is] to do that [speaking
the ʕarabiyyah]! For he is eloquent of speaking the ʕarabiyyah, as he is
a transmitter of the reading on the authority of the eloquent Arabs. And
many among those grammarians think badly of the readers, but it is not

Måḡoḡ→Maʔǧūǧ
ʕāṣim is the only reader who reads the names of Gog and Magog as yaʔǧūǧ
and maʔǧūǧ, whereas the other readers read yāǧūǧ and māǧūǧ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§1484). As these names are clearly borrowed from the Hebrewגוג ומגוגgoḡ
u-måḡoḡ, which do not have a hamzah in either word, ʕāṣim’s reading is an
innovation from its original source.
6.4.9
Zakariyyā →Zakariyyāʔ
Most readers are in agreement that the Biblical name Zachariah in Arabic is
supposed to end in a hamzah, i.e. zakariyyāʔ, this despite the fact that the
Quranic rhyme in Q19:3 clearly suggests the name was pronounced /zakariyyā/
in Quranic Arabic. Only Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim, al-Kisāʔī, Ḥamzah and Xalaf lack this
hamzah (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2840). Considering that the Hebrew name isזכריה

Sāq, sāqay-hā, sūq →saʔq, saʔqay-hā, suʔq/suʔūq
Another case of pseudocorrection is found in the plural and dual of sāq ‘thigh,
shank’ in the canonical reading traditions. While in Classical Arabic this word
is pronounced sāq pl. sūq, Ibn al-Ǧazarī (§3810) reports that Qunbul ʕan Ibn
Kaṯīr readبالسوق
(Q38:33) andسوقه
(Q48:29) with a hamzah (= bi-s-suʔq or alter-
natively bi-s-suʔūq), but his transmitter al-Bazzī read it without a hamzah. He
also reports the presence of the hamzah for the dualساقيها
(Q27:44), i.e. saʔqay-
hā ‘her two shins’.
Ibn Muǧāhid (483) explicitly points out that the singular sāqin (Q68:42, and
by extension presumably its other attestation in Q75:29) was not pronounced
with a hamzah. Eventually the form without the hamzah wins out in the clas-
sical norm, and it is clear that even by Ibn Muǧāhid’s time this was the norm,
but it is also clear that the form with hamzah was a serious contender at least
in the tradition that sprouted from Ibn Kaṯīr. For the plural, the forms suʔq
and suʔūq have become canonical in Qunbul’s transmission, rather than the
expected form sūq.
Unease with these forms used by Ibn Kaṯīr can also be gleaned in the dis-
cussion of ʔabū Ḥayyān (viii, 244 and also ix, 155), who quotes ʔabū ʕaliyy14 as
saying that forms like saʔq, saʔqay-hā and suʔq are weak, and that it is based
on a ‘well-known linguistic practice’ (luġah mašhūrah) to apply the hamzah
to a unvowelled wāw when a ḍammah precedes, citing a piece of poetry from
ʔabū Ḥibbah al-Numayrī: ʔaḥabbu l-muʔqidīna ʔilayya muʔsā ‘Moses is the
most beloved of kindlers15 to me’.This explanation fails to account for the pres-
ence of the hamzah in the dual saʔqay-hā, and presumably for that reason
ʔabū Ḥayyān disagrees. He says that the form is acceptable because there is a
hamzahintheroot,clearlyshowingthataslateashislifetimetherestillhadnot
hamzah. This is a typical example of the imposition of modern norms onto the opinions
of the Arab grammarians. Both Sībawayh (iii, 394) and al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 47; Maʕānī, i,
208) explicitly state that this name may be pronounced Zakariyyā or Zakariyyāʔu with no
normative preference for one over the other. Incidentally, as there is no reason to con-
sider Zakariyyāʔu as more original, it is of course incorrect to take its appearance in Q19:3
in rhyme as evidence that word-final āʔ had lost its hamzah, in Quranic Arabic. It sim-
ply never had it, unlike the examples I adduce of āʔ that does seem to rhyme with words
that end in a final consonant, and are words that derive from ancient *āy sequences that
shifted to āʔ (van Putten 2018, 103–105).
14
Presumably ʔabū ʕaliyy al-Fārisī (d. 377ah) a student of Ibn Muǧāhid (Ibn al-Ǧazarī al-
ġāyah, i, 189). While ʔabū ʕaliyy discusses these variants in detail in his Ḥuǧǧah (iv, 109–
111), nowhere does he call the hamzated forms weak.
15
In one of the two places that this line is cited, this form is vocalized al-muʔqidayni, but I
would not know who these two kindlers would be.

stood to be √sʔq or √swq.
The Arab grammarians were unable to resolve the question as to whether
the root was supposed to contain a hamzah or not. But from a comparative
linguistic perspective it is clear that the hamzah in the word is pseudocorrect.
Other Semitic languages show no sign of the *ʔ in this word. Aramaic has šāq,
but the sequence *aʔC should yield ēC in Aramaic. This is clear from the verbal
system, e.g. yēmar ‘he says’ < *yaʔmuru and also from other words of the shape
CaʔC, e.g. rēš ‘head’ (cf. Ar. raʔs, Hebr. roš spelled etymologically asראש
,)kēḇ
‘grief’ (cf. Ar. kaʔb ‘id.’ and Hebr. kʔeḇ‘id.’).16 Hebrew has šoq, spelled; קשthis
points to the absence of the *ʔ as Hebrew usually retains the spelling of the *ʔ
spelled with ʾålɛp̄ in the consonantal text, but šoq is not spelled **שאק
.Finally,
in Ugaritic, which retains the Proto-Semitic *ʔ with a variety of signs, lacks it
completely in this word ⟨šq⟩(not the expected **⟨šˀiq⟩). This evidence leads
us to an unambiguous reconstruction of this word for Proto-West Semitic as
*sāḳ, without a glottal stop. The form sāq is therefore etymological and forms
with a hamzah are pseudocorrect.17
On the discussion of sāq, Ibn Xālawayh (ʔiʕrāb, ii, 152f.) explicitly calls out
‘Arabs’ for placing the hamzah in places where it is incorrect.
Others said: sāq is like bāb, because the root is s-w-q, and the wāw is
changed to an ʔalif, so it is incorrect to give it a hamzah. This is what is
among the things in which the Arabs make mistakes, so they do apply the
hamzah on what does not have a hamzah, and similarly with what has
a hamzah they do not give it the hamzah, so kaʔs and raʔs and sāq their
stem shape (waznuhā) is the same (i.e. as CāC), so they make them simi-
lar to one-another, yes, he has seen that Arabs say: ḥallaʔtu s-sawīqa, but
originally it is ḥallaytu, and likewise, with ḥallaʔtu l-ʔinsāna ʕani l-māʔi
wa-l-ʔibili. However, the plural of sāq, through replacement (qalb) (of the
hamzah) is ʔaswuq without hamzah and if you wish (can be) ʔasʔuq with
hamzah.18
16
An interesting exception appears to be Aramaic ʕānā ‘sheep’, which has lost the ʔ already
in Official Aramaic times, spelledקןwhere Hebrew ṣōnצאן
,Arabic ḍaʔn and Akkadian
ṣēn point to a reconstruction *ṣ́aʔn. This is probably the result of a dissimilation of the
two guttural consonants occurring in a row.
17
As already recognized by Vollers (1906, 94). Vollers also noticed that such pseudocorrect
forms entered the classical language through other channels than Quranic recitation, this
is clear from the variable bāz/baʔz ‘falcon’, which, considering that it comes from Persian
bāz, must certainly be considered a pseudocorrection as well.
18
This is the result of a fairly regular rule in the ʕarabiyyah that sequences of *wu or *wū

6.4.11
Kās →kaʔs
As already noticed by Blau (1970, 56), much like the case of saʔq discussed
above, comparative Semitic evidence shows that kaʔs ‘cup’ must have a pseu-
docorrect hamzah in Arabic. The reflexes in Hebrewכוסkos (spelled without
ʾålɛp̄) and Aramaic kās as well as Ugaritic ⟨ks⟩leave no doubt that the recon-
struction of this noun in Proto-West Semitic is *kāts and the hamzah in the
Quranic reading traditions must be pseudocorrect. What is different from the
case of saʔq, however, is that this word is read with hamzah universally by all
the canonical readers. Moreover, this pronunciation has become the de facto
standard in Classical Arabic, although the form kās is known to exist among
the lexicographers (Lane 2639c; Lisān 3802c).
6.4.12
Yuḍāhūna →yuḍāhiʔūna
ʕāṣim is unique in readingيضهون
‘they imitate’ (Q9:30) as a iii-ʔ root yuḍāhiʔū-
na. All other readers treat the verb as a iii-w/y verb, reading yuḍāhūna (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §1532). This verb is attested in an Old Arabic inscription in Safaitic
scriptasḍhw‘tocopy’(Al-JalladandJaworska2019).AsSafaiticregularlyretains
the hamzah (Al-Jallad 2015, 45, 53), ʕāṣim’s reading is evidently pseudocorrect
here, and the majority reading is the original.
6.4.13
Aṣ-ṣābūna →aṣ-ṣābiʔūna
Thereisdisagreementamongthereadersonhowtoreadالصبين/الصبون
‘theSabi-
ans’ (Q2:62, Q5:69, Q22:17), which is variously read as aṣ-ṣābū/īna (Nāfiʕ19) an
aṣ-ṣābiʔū/īna (the others) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1496).That is, either as an active par-
ticiple from a root √ṣbw/y or from a root √ṣbʔ.
Neither the root √ṣbw/y nor √ṣbʔ is attested in Arabic in a meaning that
would elucidate the meaning of the word Sabians as an Arabic word; hence
it is usually taken to be a loanword. If Wellhausen (1897, 237) is correct to iden-
tify this word as a plural active participle derived from the Mandaic verb ṣḇā ‘to
baptize’ then we must conclude that the hamzah is a pseudocorrection. As the
Mandaic form is a final weak verb, we would expect the plural active participle
to simply be aṣ-ṣābūna.20
become ʔu, therefore the plural ʔaswuq is expected to shift to ʔasʔuq. Note that this expla-
nation is unable to make sense of the reading of the dual with hamzah, or in fact the other
plural suʔq/suʔūq.
19
ʔabū Ǧaʕfar also reads as-ṣābū/īna, but this is part of his regular pattern of dropping the
hamzah (see section §5.2).
20
The Mandaic form is likely ultimately from a root *ṣbġ which yields Ar. ṣabaġa ‘to dye,
baptize’ and Aramaic ṣḇaʕ with the typical loss of the gutturals of Mandaic.

6.4.14
Conclusion
While the cases where hamzah is applied to a word which etymologically never
had it is relatively rare, it is common enough to show that there was a real
attempt to classicize the readings towards an ideal that included hamzah, by
people to whom it was not necessarily obvious which words were supposed to
have a hamzah or not. This is certainly consistent with what we would expect
to find, considering that rhyme evidence shows that the Quran was originally
composed in the Hijazi dialect without a hamzah.
It is remarkable that a good number of these pseudocorrections are found
with Ibn Kaṯīr, the Meccan reciter. Ibn Kaṯīr, despite being a Hijazi, has a
remarkably conservative use of hamzah in his recitation. Considering how the
Hijazi vernacular appears to have mostly lost the hamzah, it is by no means
surprising that it is exactly this reader that is most prone to pseudocorrection.
It should be noted, however, that pseudocorrections are also found with other
readers. All readers read kaʔs, and the Kufans have several forms with pseudo-
correct presence of hamzah as well.
6.5
Failure to Insert hamzah
While the amount of pseudocorrect insertions of hamzah in places where the
word historically lacked the hamzah is a fairly rare occurrence among the read-
ers, failure to insert the hamzah is more common. The tradition also explicitly
acknowledges this: the dropping of hamzah is part of the ʕarabiyyah (Sīb-
awayh, iii, 541ff.) and therefore grammarians did not see it as a problem to, in
general, retain hamzah, but in cases that one was uncertain whether the root
had a hamzah, to opt for the hamzahless form instead. However, the pseudo-
correct application of hamzah was considered something to be avoided. This
can be seen, for example in ʔabū ʕamr’s statement concerning his reading
of minsaʔata-hū as minsāta-hū (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3962). On this topic al-Farrāʔ
(Maʕānī ii, 356f.) reports:
ʔabū Jaʕfar al-Ruʔāsī (d. 187ah) declared to me (al-Farrāʔ, d. 208ah) that
he asked ʔabū ʕamr (d. 154ah) about it [i.e. the pronunciation ofمنسٰته
,]
and (ʔabū ʕamr) said: “minsāta-hū is without hamzah”, and he also said:
“Because I do not know it, I remove its hamzah.”
A slightly more expanded version of this account is related by ʔabū Ḥayyān
(viii, 531):

169
ʔabū ʕamr said: “I do not apply hamza to it, because I do not know its
derivation; If it was among those (roots) that are not hamzated, I have
been (sufficiently) cautious (iḥtaṭtu), and if it was hamzated, then it
would be permissible for me to take away the hamzah in what contains a
hamzah.”
This account clearly shows that the leaving out the hamzah in places where it is
etymologically present was not considered a mistake, while adding it where it
should have been was. Moreover, it shows that adding the hamzah was a ratio-
nal and theoretical endeavour by the readers, and in case of uncertainty they
could decide to leave it out.
The reading of Ibn Ḏakwān of this word is minsaʔta-hū (sic!). This is evi-
dentlyungrammaticalasitsuggestsamiCCaCtstemformation,somethingthat
does not occur in any form of Arabic. It rather seems like an attempt at insert-
ing the hamzah into a word that he originally learned to recite as minsāta-hū. If
one disregards any forms of grammar, there is no way to decide whether a base
for minsāta-hū is to be pronounced minsaʔta-hū or minsaʔata-hū.
Al-Dānī (Ǧāmiʕ, 680) points out that Ibn Ḏakwān’s reading was considered
extremely weak by the Arab grammarians in general, because the feminine
ending should always be preceded by -a- or an ʔalif. But, he says, there is a line
of poetry, transmitted by al-ʔaxfaš (the same person who transmits this reading
for Ibn Ḏakwān), which serves as evidence that the form minsaʔt- exists:
× × ⏑– | × × ⏑– | × × ⏑– ||
× × ⏑– | × × ⏑– | × × ⏑– ||
ṣarīʕu xamrin qāma min wakaʔti-hī
ka-qawmati š-šayxi ʔilā minsaʔti-hī
‘A drunk stood up from his reclination, like the standing up of an old man on
his stick.’
The problem with this poetic evidence is that minsaʔti-hī is metrically identi-
cal to minsāti-hī, and therefore this poem can hardly be used as evidence for it.
This is assuming that this line of poetry is not an outright fabrication, which
seems more likely in this case. This anonymous line of poetry is only ever cited
to explain Ibn Ḏakwān’s reading, and al-ʔaxfaš seems to be the originator of the
line.
The contemplative and theoretical nature of the reading with or without
hamzah is also displayed in a colourful exchange between al-Kisāʔī and
Ḥamzah on the discussion of al-Kisāʔī reading ḏiʔb, as ḏīb (Xalaf,Warš and reg-
ularly by his principles ʔabū Ǧaʕfar follow him in this exceptional reading, see
Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1472). This is related in several Ṭabaqāt works, such as the one
of al-Ḏahabī (153f.):

chapter 6
[…] Muḥammad b. ʕalī b. Sulaymān al-Marwazī said: I asked Xalaf b.
Hišām: why is al-Kisāʔī called al-Kisāʔī? And he said: al-Kisāʔī entered
Kufa and came to the as-Sabīʕī mosque where Ḥamzah was teaching
recitation, and al-Kisāʔī came forward and he was wrapped in a black
robe. When Ḥamzah was done praying he said: who goes first? And it
was said: “al-Kisāʔī”, and they meant the guy in the (black) robe, and they
turned their gaze to him and said: if you are a weaver,21 you will recite
Sūrat Yūsuf and if you are a salt vendor (or sailor (?), mallāḥ), you will
recite Sūrat Ṭāhā. So, he heard them and started to recite Sūrat Yūsuf,
and when he arrived at the pericope of the wolf, he recited it without
hamzah (i.e. aḏ-ḏīb). So, Ḥamzah said: “ad-ḏiʔb is with hamzah.” So, al-
Kisāʔī replied: “So should I apply the hamzah like that in al-ḥuʔt (for al-
ḥūt ‘the whale’) as well?”—this is about (the verses) fa-ʔakala-hu ḏ-ḏiʔb
(Q12:17) and fa-ltaqama-hu l-ḥūt (Q37:142). Ḥamzah looked to Xallād the
cross-eyed, and they argued as a group, but nobody was able to (answer
him). Then they said (to al-Kisāʔī): “liberate us, please!” Then (al-Kisāʔī)
said:“Learnfromwhatthisweaverhastosay!Whenyoucompareamanto
a wolf, you say qad istaḏaʔaba r-raǧul ‘the man was fierce like a wolf’, and
if you would say istaḏāba without hamzah, then it is as if you attribute
to him emaciation (huzāl) [because ḏāb means ‘vice, fault, defect’]. But
when you liken him to a whale, you say: istaḥāta r-raǧul”—which means
he eats a lot, because a whale eats a lot—and then he recited:
ʔayyuhā ḏ-ḏību wa-bnu-hū wa-ʔabū-hū
ʔanta ʕindī min ʔaḏʔubin ḍāriyātī
‘O wolf, and his son, and his father!
You are to me among the voracious wolves!’
And he is known as al-Kisāʔī ever since that day.
This account once again shows that, while eliding the hamzah is considered
acceptable—afterallthatishowthestarof thestoryrecitesit—itisnotallowed
topseudocorrectlyapplythehamzahtowordsthatdonothaveitintheirroot.22
21
Clearly meant as an insult, weavers were despised in medieval Islamic society, a position
they share with the textor of Roman times (ei2 s.v. ḥāʾik).
22
Another humorous story about al-Kisāʔī’s reading of ḏiʔb as ḏīb exploits the polysemy of
the verb hamaza whichmeans both ‘toapply the hamzah’ and ‘to prod’. Someone asked al-
Kisāʔī: lima lā tahmizu ḏ-ḏīb? “why do you not hamzate/prod the wolf?”. To this al-Kisāʔī
answers: ʔaxāfu ʔan yaʔkula-nī! “I am afraid that it would eat me!” (al-Ḏahabī, 300) where
al-Kisāʔī is playfully riffing on the verse in which his reading aḏ-ḏīb occurs: wa-ʔaxāfu ʔan
yaʔkulahu ḏ-ḏīb “I fear that a wolf will eat him” (Q12:13).

classicized hijazi: imposition of the hamzah
171
It is worth mentioning here a not quite as colourful, but related account
on the authority of Nāfiʕ related by al-ʔaṣmaʕī →ʔabū Saʕīd al-Ḥāriṯī →Ibn
Muǧāhid: “I asked Nāfiʕ aboutالذيبandالبير
,and he said: ‘If the Arabs provide
a hamzah to them, then provide them with a hamzah’” (Ibn Muǧāhid, 346).
This quote is related in the context of disagreement among the transmitters of
Nāfiʕ on these words. While most transmitters are in agreement that he read
these words with hamzah, Warš and the non-canonical transmitter Ibn Ǧam-
māz read them as al-bīr and aḏ-ḏīb, a practice that Ibn Muǧāhid considered
mistaken (wa-hāḏā wahm). What this quote illustrates is the rather practical
nature of reading with or without hamzah. Nāfiʕ gives a rather non-committal
answertothequestion,tellingthereaderstofollowwhattheybelievewhat“the
Arabs” do.23
Once we look closer among the canonical readers, we find numerous exam-
ples where there is uncertainty on whether a word is supposed to carry a
hamzah or not, several readers opt for hamzah-less forms where according
to their general principles of recitation we would expect them to have been
retained. In the following section, we will examine the many cases of incom-
plete application of the hamzah as they occur among the readings.
All of this uncertainty about where the hamzah should go is difficult to
understand, if we assume that the language of the Quran was indeed pro-
nouncedandtransmittedwithahamzahfromtheverystart.Ontheotherhand,
such discussions make perfect sense if the Quranic language was—as is admit-
ted for Hijazi Arabic—without the hamzah, and as a new linguistic ideal of the
classical poem gained prominence, reciters started adapting features, includ-
ing the use of the hamzah, into their recitation.
6.5.1
Long Vowels Followed by Hamzah
6.5.1.1
Nabīʔ, nabīʔīn, ʔanbiʔāʔ, nubūʔah
The majority of the Quranic reciters do not pronounce the hamzah in the word
نبى,النبى
‘prophet’oritspluralsالنبين,انبياnorالنبوه
‘prophecy’.TheMedinanreciter
Nāfiʕ, however is an exception to this, as he consistently recites these words as
nabīʔ, an-nabīʔīn, ʔanbiʔāʔ and an-nubūʔah (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1531).
23
Ibn Muǧāhid seems to have understood this quote as meaning that one is indeed to pro-
nounce these words as biʔr and ḏiʔb, which reveals a significantly developed view of what
‘Classical Arabic’ is in the late third/early fourth century ah. To him what ‘Arabs’ say is
clearly the form with hamzah. But one wonders if Nāfiʕ truly meant it in such a manner.
To Sībawayh, for example, bīr and ḏīb are acceptable and certainly also something that
‘the Arabs’ say (Sībawayh, iii, 541ff.).

chapter 6
This has frequently been construed as pseudocorrect application of the
hamzah (e.g.Vollers 1906, 95; Rabin 1951, 131–133; Fischer 2002, 26), where Zwet-
tler (1978, 179f., n. 71) even claims that it was never part of the ʕarabiyyah.
From an etymological perspective it is not clear that this is correct. This word
is ultimately a loanword from Aramaic or perhaps Hebrew, and while in later
forms of both Aramaic and Hebrew the *ʔ is lost, Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic
still retain the ʾålɛp̄ spelling, suggesting its original presence and pronuncia-
tion in these respective corpora, cf. Biblical Aramaic Ktivנביאה
/*nabīʔā/; Qre
nḇiyy-å pl. Ktivנביאיא
*nabīʔ-ayyā Qre nḇiyyayyå (Ezra 5:1); Hebrewנביאnåḇi <
*nabīʔ pl.נביאיםnḇiʾim < *nabīʔīm. Cf. also Hebrewנבואהnḇuʔå ‘prophecy’ and
Biblical Aramaic Ktivבנבואת חגי
*/bi-nabūʔat/ Qre bi-nḇuʔaṯ‘the prophecy of
(Haggai)’ (Ezra 6:14). As the Aramaic loanwords in the Quran consistently show
exceptionally archaic phonology (see van Putten 2020a, 69ff.), it is not a priori
obvious that the presence of the hamzah in these words was never part of the
Classical language.
Thebelief thatthismustbeapseudocorrectionseemstobebasedonthefact
that Sībawayh (iii, 555) expresses a clear normative bias against pronouncing
the word as nabīʔ (and idem for barīʔah for bariyyah see the discussion below),
saying that this is the manner of pronunciation of the people of the Hijaz who
pronouncethehamzah,callingitrareandabhorrent(qalīlradīʔ).Butwhilethis
is the case, he clearly considers the base of this word and barīʔah to contain a
hamzah, as he discusses it as part of the shift of īʔ,ūʔ,ayʔ →iyy,uww,ayy includ-
ing words which in Classical Arabic are usually realized with the hamzah, e.g.
xaṭīʔah→xaṭiyyah ‘sin’, and maqrūʔ →maqruww ‘readable’. For the formation of
diminutives Sībawayh(iii,547) explicitlyallowsboth nubayy and nubayyiʔ,but
the diminutives of barīʔah/bariyyah and nubūʔah/nubuwwah he only endorses
the forms with hamzah, i.e. burayyiʔah and nubayyiʔah. So, while he has a nor-
mative opinion for the dropping of hamzah, he clearly considers the ʔaṣl of the
word to have had the hamzah. We cannot conclude from this that nabīʔ or bar-
īʔah are pseudocorrect, but only that the now normative form without hamzah
had gained enough ground in Basra in Sībawayh’s time that it was considered
normative despite being exceptional among the people that usually preserve
thehamzah.ButNāfiʕisMedinanandacontemporaryof Sībawayh’steacheral-
Xalīl b. ʔaḥmad, so clearly it was still part of the ʕarabiyyah at that time despite
Sībawayh’s misgivings.
Despite the archaic nature of Nāfiʕ’s reading, it is quite clear that this was
not the reading that belonged to the language of the qct. The broken plural
pattern the qct uses (ʔaCCiCāʔ) is almost exclusively applied to final weak
and geminate roots only a few sound roots have this pattern, e.g. ġaniyy →ʔaġ-
niyāʔ ‘rich’ and šadīd →ʔašiddāʔ ‘strong’, qarīb →ʔaqribāʔ ‘relative’ (van Putten

2020a, 64). Had the Quranic Arabic form indeed been nabīʔ, we would have
rather expected a plural nubaʔāʔ.24 This plural pattern therefore suggests that
in Quranic Arabic, as would be expected in Hijazi Arabic the final hamzah had
been lost and the word was indeed pronounced as the majority of the readers
read it.
Nāfiʕ’s reading in this case is therefore an archaism, and one that was not
considered proper by everyone. A commonly cited prophetic Hadith has some-
oneaddresstheprophetby yānabīʔaḷḷāh,whichispromptlydenouncedbythe
prophet. This tradition is explicitly invoked as one of the reasons why a reciter
might read nabiyy instead of nabīʔ by Ibn Xālawayh (Ḥuǧǧah, 80f.): “the first
reason is that applying the hamzah is heavy on their speech, and the evidence
for this is his speech (pbuh): I am not the prophe’ of God (lastu nabīʔa ḷḷāh); it
is as if he disliked applying the hamzah because he was of Qurayš who do not
apply the hamzah”.
6.5.1.2
Barīʔah/bariyyah
Another loanword from Aramaic or Hebrew isالبريه
‘creature’ (Q98:6,7), which
like nabīʔ, is read as al-barīʔah by Nāfiʕ, but in this case Ibn Ḏakwān ʕan Ibn
ʕāmir joins him in this reading, other reciters read al-bariyyah (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§1536).
Here too we are likely dealing not with a pseudocorrection, but an accurate
transmission of the ancient pronunciation of an original in Hebrewבריאהbriʾå
and/or Aramaic (Jeffery 2007, 76), which is a derivation from the verbברא
‘to
create’ (Hebrew bårå), which likewise was borrowed into Arabic as baraʔa.
6.5.1.3
Nasīʔ
النسى
(Q9:37) ‘the postponement’ is read by Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ (in the path of al-
ʔazraq) and ʔabū Ǧaʕfar as an-nasiyy while the other readers read it as an-nasīʔ
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1525). In the context, it seems quite clear that we should derive
this word from the root nasaʔa ‘to postpone; to drive’, and not from nasā ‘to for-
get’, where an-nasiyy would end up meaning ‘the forgotten one; that which is to
be forgotten’. Note that minsaʔah, also a word derived from this root, likewise
yielded uncertainty among the readers as to whether or not it should have the
hamzah (see §6.5 above).

chapter 6
Ibn Muǧāhid (314) reports several other readings. In non-canonical trans-
mission paths of Ibn Kaṯīr we find an-nasʔ (ʕuqayl ←Šibl ←Ibn Kaṯīr)—a
reading that seems to disagree with the rasm—and an-nasiyy (ʕubayd ←Šibl
←Ibn Kaṯīr). He also reports an-nasy on Ibn Kaṯīr’s authority, but without ʔis-
nād.
6.5.1.4
Xaṭīʔah pl. xaṭāyā ‘sin’
A clear example of failure to apply hamzah in the qct which has subsequently
made it into the Classical Arabic language is the plural formation of xaṭīʔah
‘sin’, its plural, xaṭāyā, not only lacks the expected hamzah altogether, it could
never have even had this hamzah, as the plural formation it employs is one
typical of final-weak roots. Fischer (2002, §99b) cites as examples hadiyyah
pl. hadāyā ‘gift’, hirāwah pl. harāwā ‘club’ and zāwiyah pl. zawāyā ‘corner,
angle’.
TherearesomeothercontextsinwhichtheCaCāCāpluralappears,butnone
of them apply to xaṭīʔah.25 There are a few isolated lexical items that take
this plural of sound roots, for example yatīm pl. yatāmā. Note, however, that if
xaṭīʔah would belong to this group of nouns we would have expected **xaṭāʔā
rather than the inexplicable xaṭāyā.
As such we would expect the original singular of this noun in Quranic Ara-
bic to have been the hamzahless form xaṭiyyah, following the same derivation
as hadiyyah. The reading xaṭiyyah was subsequently classicized to xaṭīʔah by
all readers, while failing to classicize the plural formation along with it.26 The
issue of this specific broken plural pattern associated with this singular was
not lost on the Arab grammarians, and Lisān al-ʕarab has a lengthy discussion
on what was evidently perceived as a problematic plural. The regular plural of
CaCīCah nouns is CaCāʔiC (cf. ḥadīqah pl. ḥadāʔiq; madīnah pl. madāʔin), and
as such the expected plural is al-xaṭāʔiʔu,27 due to the regular elision of the
second hamzah when two hamzahs follow in a row, this should have become
al-xaṭāʔī, in the same way that the active participle of ‘to come’ turns from al-
ǧāʔiʔu into al-ǧāʔī, and it would therefore be expected to have merged with
the faʕālin type plurals. Sībawayh (iii, 552f.) starts his discussion of this plural
25
For example, it is a regular plural (besides CaCāCin) for nouns that end in the feminine
endings -ā and -āʔ, e.g. fatwā ‘legal opinion’, pl. fatāwin, fatāwā and ʕaḏrāʔ ‘virgin’ pl.
ʕaḏārin, ʕaḏārā (Fischer 2002, §99a).
26
The expected for xaṭiyyah is attested in Classical Arabic lexicons (Lane 761c; Lisān 1193b).
27
Al-Zamaxšarī (mufaṣṣal, 167) cites ʔabū Zayd as having heard someone use this original
plural in aḷḷāhumma ġfir lī xaṭāʔiʔī “O God, forgive me my sins.”

with: “it is as if [the hamzah] was turned into a yāʔ and the end of xaṭāyā (i.e.
the yāʔ of xaṭāʔī) was replaced with an ʔalif ”. He then commences to explain
how one could get from a singular xaṭīʔah to the plural xaṭāyā without having
toassumeasingularbase xaṭiyyah.Helikensthereplacementof thefinal yāʔof

Sībawayh has to draw an analogy with a CaCiyyah noun, to be able to explain
the presence of this plural pattern, while the discussion seems explicitly aimed
to avoid this. This brings him to an intermediary form *xaṭāʔā. The hamzah
of *xaṭāʔā is subsequently replaced with a yāʔ because it stands between two
ʔalifs. While hamzah as a root consonant can stand between two ʔalifs such as
in kisāʔāni, kisāʔā, hanāʔā, this is not the case for *xaṭāʔā because its hamzah
is not a root consonant, but part of the plural pattern (CaCāʔiC), therefore it is
weakened to a yāʔ instead, yielding xaṭāyā. The change from ī →ā is, of course,
ad hoc, as is the rule for replacing the hamzah with a yāʔ to go from xaṭāʔā to
xaṭāyā, which as far as I can tell is not applied to any other word in the lexi-
con.
The complexity of discussion ultimately comes down to the fact that Sīb-
awayh, and grammarians after him (see the discussions in Lisān, 1193, for exam-
ple) refuse to use a surface form like xaṭiyyah—a form explicitly considered
to be allowed—for the derivation of the plural. This constraint that the gram-
marians imposed upon themselves does not lead to a convincing explana-
tion, and that does not seem to have been the point. The grammarians were
simply trying to find an explanation of how one could hypothetically come
from the idealized source form xaṭīʔah to xaṭāyā without having to assume
the loss of hamzah as the basis. The self-evident explanation for the plural
xaṭāyā is that it was formed upon the form xaṭiyyah, not xaṭīʔah, thus betray-
ing an original hamzahless form, despite its absence in the canonical read-
ings.

Post-consonantal Hamzah
Above, we discussed a class of words with the lack of the expected hamzah
whenitoccursafteralongvowel.Butthisisnottheonlypositionwherewefind
that readers irregularly lose the hamzah. We also find it in post-consonantal
position.
The very name of the Quran itself is one of these cases where the pres-
ence of the hamzah is disagreed upon. The word is spelled both defectivelyقرن
and pleneقرانin early manuscripts, and it is usually read as qurʔān, however
Ibn Kaṯīr reads it as qurān (Ibn al-Ǧazari, §1571). There can be no doubt that
the root of qurʔān ‘recital’ is qaraʔa ‘to recite’, and thus in qurān the expected

chapter 6
hamzah is missing. Attempts of Arab philologers to see Ibn Kaṯīr’s qurān as a
derivation from qarana ‘to bring together’ are obviously not very satisfying (Jef-
fery 2007, 233).
Nāfiʕ treats two CiCC verbal nouns derived from iii-ʔ roots as CiC stems,
رداridan (versus the other readers ridʔan) ‘as help’ (Q28:34; Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§1559) andملmilu ‘fullness’ (Q3:91; Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1560, only in the path of
al-ʔaṣbahānī from Warš, and with disagreement among his transmitters). Thus
here, like our previous word, post-consonantal hamzah was incompletely re-
inserted in this reading.
The qct of the Quran makes it clear that there was no hamzah in the imper-
ative saʔala ‘to ask’, as it is consistently spelled. لسHad this word had a medial
hamzah, we would have expected a prothetic ʔalif in the imperative **اسلfor
isʔal. As such, to agree with the rasm, readers have to read sal if nothing is
prefixed to the word. However, whenever wa- or fa- precede the imperative,
readers generally include the hamza, as now the rasm allows the correct syl-
lable structure, hence: wa-sʔal al-qaryah ‘ask the village’ (Q12:82) and fa-sʔalū
ʔahla ḏ-ḏikr ‘ask the people of remembrance’ (Q16:43). Ibn Kaṯīr, al-Kisāʔī and
Xalaf, however, always read the hamzahless form regardless of context (Ibn al-
Ǧazari, §1562). Either reading is, of course, irregular as the imperfect forms of
this verb have the same phonetic context but are invariably read as yasʔalu etc.
There are several words that are expected to have a post-consonantal ham-
zahoncomparativegrounds,butwhereallreadersareinagreementtonotread
the hamzah.The most obvious of these is the wordملكmalak ‘angel’.This word
is generally taken to be a loanword from Gəʕəz mălʔăk pl. mălaʔəkt ‘id.’, mostly
because it shares the same plural formation as the Arabicمليكهmalāʔikah,
which is a plural formation that is rare, and mostly restricted to loanwords (van
Putten 2020a, 66). The Gəʕəz form itself is, of course ultimately derived from
the Hebrewמלאךmalʾåḵ‘id.’ or Aramaic malʾaḵā ‘id.’
The Arabic plural itself clearly points to a missing postconsonantal hamzah;
there are no other CaCaC nouns that have such a quadriradical plural forma-
tion (or more common formations like CaCāʔiC).The lexicographical tradition
does in fact record the expected form malʔak (Lisān 4269b), but the canonical
readers are in agreement that the form is malak, despite this being an irregular
outcome within the phonologies of these reading traditions.
The imperfect of the verb raʔā forms a surprising exception to the reten-
tion of postconsonantal hamzah, as it is not yarʔā but yarā/yarē among all the
canonical readers. The irregular behaviour of this verb seems to have already
been a feature of the ʕarabiyyah by the time of Sībawayh (iii, 546), as he
explicitly mentions the exceptional nature of this word: “all Arabs agree on the
dropping of it (the hamzah in forms like ʔarā, tarā, yarā, narā) because of its

frequent use”, but he adds: “ʔabū al-Xaṭṭāb told me that he has heard one say
qad ʔarʔā-hum bringing the verb in its original form raʔaytu, among the trust-
worthy Arabs.” Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 165) also says that all Arabs agree on dropping
the hamzah with the exception of the Banū ʔasad and Taym al-Rabāb.28
6.5.3
Intervocalic Hamzah
6.5.3.1
Riʔāʔa n-nās →riyāʔa n-nās
ريا الناس
‘to be seen by men’ (Q2:264; Q4:38; Q8:47) is read by most readers as
riʔāʔa n-nās, the regular outcome of a fiʕāl stem of the root √rʔy, but ʔabū Ǧaʕ-
far has irregularly shifted the medial hamzah to yāʔ, yielding riyāʔa n-nās (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī §1490).29
6.5.3.2
Liʔallā →liyallā
Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ in the path of al-ʔazraq readsليلاas liyallā ‘so that not’ (Q2:150;
Q4:165; Q57:29), while the rest of the Quranic readers read li-ʔallā (Ibn al-
Ǧazarī, §1495). This is irregular behaviour in the reading of Warš, which oth-
erwise retains the hamzah in such environments.
6.5.3.3
Kufuʔan, huzuʔan →kufuwan, huzuwan
While Ḥafṣis generally very conservative in the retention of the hamzah, he is
unique in dropping the hamzah inكفوا
‘an equal’ andهزوا
‘contempt’, reading
them as kufuwan and huzuwan respectively, while the other readers read these
words either as kufuʔan/huzuʔan (the majority reading) or kufʔan/huzʔan
(Ḥamzah) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §2668).
6.5.3.4
Bādiya r-raʔyi →bādiʔa r-raʔyi
An interesting point of disagreement among the readers on the placement of
the hamzah occurs in the phraseبادى الراى
(Q11:27). The majority of the read-
ers readsبادى الراىas bādiya r-raʔyi, only ʔabū ʕamr reads it with hamzah,
28
A few early manuscripts appear to give evidence that in earlier times such readings were
more widespread. The vocalization of Arabe 334a’sيروا
(Q36:31), places a fatḥah sign on
the rāʔ which likely denotes the presence of a hamzah, thus suggesting yarʔaw, and the
spellingيراىin dam 01.29-1 leaves little doubt the scribe intended yarʔā/yarʔē, as this
manuscript frequently employs the ʔalif to denote the presence of hamzah (van Putten
2019a, 370, n. 210).
29
This should not be considered part of the dissimilation of two consecutive hamzahs as
in *ʔaʔimmah > ʔayimmah ‘Imāms’ and *ǧāʔiʔun > ǧāʔin ‘coming’ as suggested by Fischer
(2002, §41a). The dissimilation, at least as described by Sībawayh (iii, 552) is always pro-
gressive, not regressive, and only occurs if a short vowel intervenes.

chapter 6
i.e. bādiʔar-raʔyi (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1535). However, it is not entirely clear that we
are dealing with a pseudocorrection or irregular absence of hamzah.
Ibn Xālawayh (Ḥuǧǧah, 186) takes ʔabū ʕamr’s reading as primary, saying
that whoever reads it as bādiya is deriving it from the verb badaʔa/yabdaʔu ‘to
begin’ and is dropping the hamzah thus understanding the phrase as “begin-
ning in opinion”. If this interpretation is correct, we are indeed dealing with the
absence of the expected hamzah which is irregular among each of the readers
that reads it thus.
However, al-Farrāʔ (Maʕānī, ii, 11) clearly has a different opinion and views
bādiya and bādiʔa as two separate lexical items. He tells us: “you should not
apply the hamzah to bādiya, because the meaning yabdū ‘it is obvious’ seems
more obvious to us [i.e. “obvious in opinion”]; if you were to apply the hamzah
to it, then you would intend the meaning ʔawwal al-raʔy “first/beginning in
opinion.”” If al-Farrāʔ is correct to see the two readings as intending two dif-
ferent meanings, this obviously still stems from an ambiguity of the text which
only became ambiguous when readers started to add the hamzah to the recita-
tion of the Quran.
6.5.4
Pre-consonantal Hamzah
Among the canonical readers, the dropping of hamzah in pre-consonantal
position is by far the most common, because it is a regular practice in a
restricted form with Warš, and mostly unrestricted for ʔabū Ǧaʕfar and ʔabū
ʕamr (optional for the latter). For the other readers, however, such dropping of
the hamzah is not regular, but despite that, it is occasionally attested in isolated
words among the other canonical readers.
At the start of this section (§6.5) we already mentioned that al-Kisāʔī read
aḏ-ḏīb ‘the wolf’ without hamzah. Xalaf joins him in this reading.Warš likewise
drops the hamzah in this word, but adds to it also bīr ‘well’, and bīsa, bīsa-
mā ‘how bad!’ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1471–1472). Also, the reduplicated noun luʔluʔ,
Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim goes against his general principles reads lūluʔ in all its attes-
tations (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1482). Qālūn ʕan Nāfiʕ and Ibn Ḏakwān ʕan Ibn ʕāmir
readريا
(Q19:74) as riyyan rather than riʔyan (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §1483). Finally,
QālūnʕanNāfiʕ,withdisagreementamonghistransmitters,readsal-mūtafikah
(Q53:53)andal-mūtafikāt (Q9:70;Q69:9)‘thatwhichisoverthrown’,ratherthan

التين
‘the fig’ (Q95:1) is an example where all readers are in agreement that
the word is to be read as at-tīn, without hamzah, whereas from an etymological
perspective, it seems that this word should have had a hamzah. Hebrewתאנה30

The pronunciation tʔenå of the Tiberian reading tradition is likely also pseudocorrect, as

be expected to just yield tiʔn in varieties that retained *ʔ.
The suppletive imperative hātū ‘give!’ lacks a hamzah among all readers
where it would be expected to exist. The verb is transparently historically
derived from an imperative of the C-stem of √ʔty, i.e. ʔātā ‘to give’, and it still
inflects as an imperative of this type in Classical Arabic hāti (m.sg.); hātī (f.sg.);
hātiyā (du.); hātū (m.pl.); hātīna (f.pl.). In the Quran only the masculine plural
hātū is attested (Q2:111; Q21:24; Q27:64; Q28:75).
The initial h is an ancient retention of the Central Semitic C-stem, which
had an *h- as can be seen, for example in the Hebrew C-stem that has the
shape hip̄ʕel. So, where the causative in Classical Arabic is expected to be ʔāti <
*ʔaʔti,theformhātidevelopedfromaformwithretained*h-,i.e.*haʔti.31While
Classical Arabic undergoes a dissimilatory process of *ʔvʔ > ʔv̄ that can explain
the lack of the glottal stop in the regular imperative ʔāti, this same sound law
cannot be used to explain the absence of the glottal stop in hāti, which has
irregularly lost the hamzah in Classical Arabic as well as all reading traditions.
This form probably developed because the form hāt(i) was not transparently
analysable to the speakers anymore as coming from the root √ʔty, and thus the
hamzah could not be reinstated.
6.5.5
Interchange between iii-w/y and iii-ʔ Verbs
In most, if not all, modern Arabic dialects, iii-w/y and iii-ʔ merge completely.
This merger is already well on its way in the language of the qct. In the imper-
fect, the verbs appear to have been indistinguishable from final weak verbs,
and in the imperative and jussive, etymological iii-ʔ verbs behave as iii-y verbs
threeof theseventimestheyoccur(seeAppendixA.4.13).Theresultof thispar-
tial merger has also led to disagreement between the readers as to whether a
verb form should be treated as a iii-ʔ or a iii-y verb.
Most conspicuous of the verbs that show this disagreement is the verb ʔar-
ǧaʔa/ʔarǧā ‘to postpone’ forms of which occur throughout the Quran, with
clear disagreement between the readers (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1229; §1533).
31
For an account of the development of the C-stem from *s¹ to *h and ultimately to ʔ in
Arabic, see Al-Jallad (yusapʕil). Al-Jallad argues that *s¹ regularly becomes h on word-
boundaries in Proto-Central Semitic. For Arabic, *h becomes ʔ in pre-stress position, thus
explaining the shift of *him ‘if’ and *hinna ‘verily’ to ʔin and ʔinna. He moreover argues
that *hafʕala > ʔafʕala is the result of the same sound shift, drawing upon stress mark-
ing in the Damascus Psalm fragment to argue that the stress of C-stems was *ʔafʕála in
Proto-Arabic, something that would be corroborated by Hebrew which likewise carries
the stress in this position. If this is correct, it would seem that the imperative form of the
verb of *haʔti carried the stress on the penultimate, i.e. *háʔti, which would explain the
retention of the *h in this position.

Leaving the unusual treatment of the pronominal suffix ofارجهaside for now
(for a discussion on that see §7.1.8), there is a mostly regular split: The Dam-
ascene, Meccan and Basran readers treat the verb as a iii-ʔ root, whereas the
Medinans and Kufans treat it as a iii-y root, with the exception of Šuʕbah ʕan
ʕāsim who has a mixed paradigm where the imperative is iii-y and the other
forms iii-ʔ. As I have found no cognates of this verb in other Semitic languages,
it is difficult to be sure whether the form with the hamzah is the original form,
or a pseudocorrection.
Another verb that shows disagreement between the readers are derivations
from waṭiʔa ‘to tread, step on’. ʔabū Ǧaʕfar in accordance with a general rule
of his readsيواطوا
(Q9:37) as yuwāṭū rather than yuwāṭiʔū as the rest. However,
the forms of the G-stemيطون
(Q9:120),تطوها
(Q33:27),تطوهم
(Q48:25) he reads
as yaṭawna, taṭaw-hā and taṭaw-humū respectively, where the other readers
read yaṭaʔūna, taṭaʔū-hā and taṭaʔū-hum(ū). These forms are not the regu-
lar outcome of his general hamzah loss rules. Other verbs of this type simply
retain the hamzah, e.g.يقرون
(Q10:94; Q17:71) as yaqraʔūna. He also readsموطيا
‘step’ (Q9:120) as mawṭiyan rather than mawṭiʾan. ʔabū Ǧaʕfar is inconsistent
on the treatment of this sequence, cf.سيياsayyiʔan (Q9:102) butخاسياxāsiyā
(Q67:4).
However, he treatsوطا
‘impression’ (Q73:6) as a iii-ʔ stem, reading waṭʔan.
This is rather surprising as wiṭāʔan is also consistent with the rasm and would
have matched the treatment of this root as both iii-y and iii-ʔ, and this is in
fact how ʔabū ʕamr and Ibn ʕāmir read (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4467).
6.5.6
Sāla for saʔala (Q70:1)
Nāfiʕ, ʔabū Ǧaʕfar and Ibn ʕāmir readسالin Q70:1 (and only there) as sāla, with
the expected hamzah not reinstated, which they do have elsewhere in their
reading. Thus, for both of themسالكis read as saʔala-ka in Q2:186, for example
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4441).

behaviour of al-Bazzī with this noun. In fact, even the other cases of the phrase

Conclusion
In the above sections we have examined the position of the hamzah among
the canonical readers. As is clear from this discussion we can find ample exam-
ples both of the application of hamzah where it is evidently pseudocorrect
and places where the reading traditions lack hamzah where their regular rules
would not predict it. These findings show that Blau’s assertion that there is no
trace of pseudocorrection in the Quran is incorrect. Besides a good number
of pseudocorrect hamzahs, we also find many examples where the readers fail
to insert the hamzah where we would expect it. This combined with reports
of introduction of hamzah in the second century (at least in Medina) suggests
thatapplicationof thehamzahintothetextwaspartof thegoalsof theQuranic
readers. These readers would not always have the means to do this correctly,
sometimes overzealously applied it to words that certainly never had it, and in
other cases refrained due to uncertainty.
Of course, this does not show that the language was composed without
hamzah,thatevidencecanonlyberetrievedfromQuranicrhymeandorthogra-
phy. What it does show is that the Quranic reading traditions cannot be taken
as a reliable guide for the language of the Quran in this regard. The readers
were actively trying to apply hamzah in what they considered to be the correct
way (mistaken or not), and there is no indication that these attempts had any-
thing to do with what the situation was in the original composition. As such,
the presence and pervasive use of hamzah in the Quranic reading traditions
cannot inform us as to what the treatment of the hamzah in the original lan-
guage of the Quran was.

Classicized Hijazi: final short vowels and tanwīn
ibn masʕūd
∵
One of the quintessential features of Classical Arabic, but one that is strik-
ingly elusive in both the epigraphic pre-Islamic record and the orthography of
early Islamic Arabic is the presence of ʔiʕrāb and tanwīn. Much has been said
about the question whether this system was part of the spoken language, or
purely part of a poetic oral tradition. Some authors argued that this case sys-
tem must have been part of the general spoken register (e.g. Blau 1977) while
others felt that it must have been purely part of the poetic performance (e.g.
Zwettler 1978). These arguments have now for a large part been superseded by
material evidence not available at the time. The view that everyone who spoke
Arabic in the pre-Islamic period must have had the full inflectional system of
ʔiʕrāb and tanwīn can be discarded with certainty, as we now have thousands
of inscriptions and papyri that prove the contrary (Al-Jallad and al-Manaser
2015; Al-Jallad 2015; 2017a; 2018a). This should change our perspective of what
we should expect the inflectional system of the Quran to look like: if multiple
varieties of Old Arabic from Syria and Jordan lacked the full inflectional system
of Classical Arabic, how can we be certain that this is not also the case for the
language of the Quran?
Blau appears to have not found such argumentation compelling because
he considered Arabic in Syria and Jordan to be peripheral and, explicitly dis-
cussing the case system of Nabataean and what the implications may be for
thelanguagesituationof theHijaz,heconcludesthat“nothingmustbeinferred
fromborderdialectsforcentraldialects”(Blau1977,9).Whilecertainlywemust
agree that one cannot conclude that just because the Proto-Arabic case sys-
tem seems to have started to deteriorate in Nabataean Arabic, this must have
necessarily been true for Hijazi Arabic as well, I see no reason to dismiss this
possibility either, just because these varieties are “peripheral”. In fact, it has
long been recognized in dialectology that it is rather the peripheral dialects,

where certain innovative waves may not reach are often the ones that tend to
be most archaic (Owens 2006, 29). However, even taking Nabataean Arabic
(and by extension Safaitic) as a “border dialects” and Hijazi Arabic as a “cen-
tral dialect” rather belies an adherence to an unfounded assumption that it is
indeed Nabataean Arabic that is peripheral and Hijazi Arabic that is central.
As more and more pre-Islamic epigraphy, Arabic and otherwise, has become
available it seems to become ever more clear that it is in fact Arabic spoken
in Arabia that was the peripheral form of pre-Islamic Arabic, rather than cen-
tral as the historiographical and genealogical myth making of the early Islamic
empire may make us believe (Al-Jallad 2018b, 34).
Rather than relying on notions of periphery and centrality, we must rather
turnourgazetothedataathand.ThefactthatOldArabicfromSyriaandJordan
lacked the full inflectional system known to Proto-Arabic—whether these vari-
eties were peripheral or not—at least prove that such varieties did exist before
Islam, and that the case system did not only begin its collapse at the start of
(or even due to) the Islamic conquests as suggested, for example by Blau (1977,
16) and Versteegh (1984, 91). When referring to what the language of the Quran
is, indeed nothing must be inferred from border dialects but they must not be
inferred from central dialects either. The evidence of the Quran must speak for
itself.
When addressing the question of the case system of the Quran however, cer-
tainly nothing must be inferred from statements by the Arabic grammarians,
who seemingly admit no other option but speaking with full inflection. This is
for two reasons. First, the grammarians are not contemporary with the Quran
and therefore can hardly be considered direct witnesses of the language of the
Quran. Second, the grammarians’ treatment of the case system is highly ideo-
logical. They famously ignore the existence of non-inflectional forms of Arabic
completely even in times where there can be little doubt this system had been
lost completely in any vernacular spoken at the time, e.g. in the time of al-
Zamaxšarī (d. 538/1143). One is hard pressed to find any admission that such
forms of Arabic exist at all in his work, despite its disappearance in most, if not
all, vernaculars.1
Iwillnotdiscussherewhetherthefullinflectionalsystemof ClassicalArabic
was part of the spoken register of some people, or a purely poetic register. For
our current discussion, I do not think that this question is relevant. The ques-
1 The earliest admissions by grammarians that people do not quite seem to speak the way
they prescribe the language seems to first start to appear in the fourth century ah, by al-
Zaǧǧāǧī (d. 337/948) and Ibn Ǧinnī (d. 392/1002), the latter however citing al-ʔaxfaš al-ʔawsaṭ
(d. 215/830) (see Blanc 1979, 171; Versteegh 1995, 96f.; Larcher 2018).

tion we should ask is whether the language of the Quran had a full inflectional
system or not, a question which should be treated separately from the ques-
tion of whether the system is proper to a vernacular or poetic register. Here we
cannot turn to later sources, but we must base ourself on the earliest linguistic
source that we have for the Quran: the qct.
In an earlier article, my colleague Phillip W. Stokes and I have argued that,
while the language of the Quran had not completely lost case inflection, the
system had been significantly reduced (van Putten and Stokes 2018). We argue
that word-final -an had shifted to -ā and that all other forms of final short vow-
els and nunation (i.e. -a, -i, -u, -un and -in) had been lost without a trace, not
just in pause but also in connected speech. Only with nouns in construct, case
appears to have been (perhaps optionally) retained.The arguments we present
in favour of this view, rely on a careful study of the orthographic behaviour
and internal rhyme patterns of the qct. It seems worthwhile to summarize the
main points here again, before we move on with the discussion.
1.
Pausal spelling cannot account for the lack of marking of ʔiʕrāb and
especially tanwīn.
The1sg.endings-nī ‘me’and-ī ‘my’areshortenedinpausalenvironments,
and this is reflected in the orthography of the Quran only in pause. Had
‘pausalspelling’beenageneralprinciple,wewouldexpectthisshortening
to be reflected in the consonantal text consistently. To this we may now
alsoaddtheappearanceof afinal-hinpausalformsof theimperativeand
apocopate, which likewise only shows up in the qct if such a word actu-
allystandsinapausalposition(seeAppendixA.4.14).Itthereforedoesnot
seem to be true that the orthography of the Quran always spells words as
they are pronounced in pause. This therefore fails to explain the absence
of signsforʔiʕrābandespeciallytanwīninthespellinginnon-pausalposi-
tion.
Whilethefemininenounbeingusuallyspelledwithhāʔ inconstructposi-
tion is often invoked as evidence for the ‘pausal spelling principle’, it is
nothing of the sort. The feminine noun in construct is unusual, and cer-
tainly orthographic, but its behaviour is unlike any other noun in con-
struct, which are not spelled in their pausal form at all. For example,
the construct form of banūna is simply spelledبنواin construct not in its
pausal formبنونandابى لهبspells the construct form asابىthe way it is
pronounced in construct as well, and not in its pausal form. باAuthors
who continue the myth that Arabic spelling is based on the pronuncia-
tion in pause are unjustly generalizing from the exceptional behaviour of
the feminine ending to the orthography of the whole Quran.2
2 The explanation through a principle of pausal spelling is not a recent one, it is how the

2.
The distribution of the spelling of tāʔ maftūḥah and tāʔ marbūṭah for
the feminine ending points to a dialectal distribution: -at in construct
and -ah everywhere else.
The feminine ending is occasionally written withتـrather than, هـthis
invariably occurs when the noun stands in construct. In this position it
is fairly common, occurring 22% of the time. Outside of construct it is
invariably spelled with. هـHad the feminine ending been pronounced -
at in all non-pausal environments, we would be at a loss to explain why
it is not spelledـتsimilarly often in non-construct, non-pausal position.
What we find, however is that the feminine ending, in the 1800+ times
that the feminine ending is not in construct, not once is it spelled with
. تـIf we reasonably take the 22% of construct feminine nouns as the
baseline for accidental phonetic spelling instead of pausal spelling, we
wouldsimilarlyexpectnon-constructfemininesoutsideof pausetooccur
spelled withـتabout 22% of the time, i.e. about 400 times. The actual
score, however, is zero. This strongly suggests that outside of construct
the feminine ending was never pronounced -at, not in pause nor in con-
text. Thus, this distribution suggests that the feminine ending was always
pronounced -ah except in construct where it was pronounced -at. So this
distribution points to a morphology of the noun identical to that of mod-
ern Arabic dialects with -at in construct and -ah everywhere else.3
3.
Internalrhymesuggeststhat“pausal”pronunciationswereusedinnon-
pausal positions4
Examples include: xayran la-hum rhyming with ʔarḥāma-kum (Q47:21–
22), suggesting /xayrā la-hum/; and the rhyming epithet pairs in formu-
medieval Arab grammarians explained the unusual mismatch between the Arabic orthogra-
phy and its classical pronunciation. For example, Ibn al-Sarrāǧ (d. 316ah) in his Kitāb al-Xaṭṭ
lays out the principle explicitly: wa-l-ʔaṣlu ʔayḍan fī kulli kalimatin ʔan tuktaba ʕalā l-lafẓi bi-
hā mubtadaʔatan wa-mawqūfan ʕalay-hā “And the principle is also that for each word that it
be written with the pronunciation of it at the beginning of an utterance, and if it was paused
upon.” (Ibn al-Sarrāǧ Kitāb al-Xaṭṭ, 67). We of course cannot blindly rely on a 4th c. ah source
to tell us how the orthographic rules of the 1st c. ah worked. The explanation is just as much
a post hoc justification as it is for a modern scholar to hold this view.
3 In fact this exact distribution is seen as evidence for a modern dialectal type feminine ending
in Middle Arabic texts (e.g. Blau 1967, §24.1; 2002, 34; Blau and Hopkins 1987, §47a). If this
argument is deemed convincing for Middle Arabic, it should also be accepted for Quranic
Arabic.
4 For several examples of internal rhymes that seem to operate on “pausal” forms, see also
Larcher (2014). In a recent article Larcher (2021) explores one more possible case of internal
rhymes using pausal forms and, seemingly independently, explicitly adopts the same conclu-
sions as Van Putten & Stokes (2018).

lae such as ʔinna ḷḷāha samīʕun ʕalīm (Q49:1) and wa-kāna ḷḷāhu ʕalīman
ḥakīmā (Q48:4) suggesting /samīʕ ʕalīm/ and /ʕalīmā ḥakīmā/.
4.
Several words reflect the regular outcome of the loss of the final short
vowels and n, in places where they are not morphologically ʔiʕrāb and
tanwīn.
For example, the apocopate *yakun spelled as( كيQ8:53) and the ener-
gic forms *la-nasfaʕa-n and *la-yakūnan being spelledلنسفعا
(Q96:15) and
ليكونا
(Q12:32) respectively.
On the basis of these arguments, it seems likely to me that the Quran, far
from having a fully classical ʔiʕrāb/tanwīn system as is generally believed,
had a much reduced one. However, we cannot admit a full reworking of the
text towards a Classical Arabic system by later grammarians/philologists from
something more-or-less identical to the modern dialectal Arabic system as
Vollers would have had it.This would have required a reworking of the qct, we
now have access to early manuscripts that closely follow the standard text that
can be securely dated before the period of the development of Arabic gram-
matical theory, as its canonization almost certainly happened during the reign
of ʕuṯmān b. ʕaffān.5
The absence of any transmission of reading traditions that lacked ʔiʕrāb
seems to have been the main objection of Nöldeke against Vollers’ ʔiʕrāb-less
ur-Quran. A spirited defense of Vollers’ hypothesis was put forward in three
articles by Kahle (1947, 78–84; 1948, 163–182; 1949) who, aiming to counter Nöld-
eke’s claim, proffers over a hundred prophetic, and non-prophetic narrations
admonishing people not to read the Quran without ʔiʕrāb. Many of these nar-
rationsmustbeoutrightfabrications,unlessweacceptthatafull-fledgedgram-
matical terminology was part of the common parlance of the prophet and his
companions. Nevertheless, they show an important point: there were in fact
people reading the Quran without ʔiʕrāb, and this was happening early enough
that an authority as early as al-Farrāʔ (d. 207/822) felt the need to relate such
narrations to discourage it. This made short work of Nöldeke’s unusually weak
criticism of Vollers. However, this does not seem to have swayed later authors
who continue to cite Nöldeke’s review. Rabin (1955) agrees with Nöldeke and
is right to point out that, just because there were people who read the Quran
without ʔiʕrāb—something clearly considered to be disturbing to those who
relate these narrations—this does not mean that there was an ʔiʕrāb-less ur-
Quran. Conversely, however, the opposite is of course also true: that reading
5 ConsideringthelimitedaccessibilitytoearlyQuranicmanuscripts,orthelackof soundphilo-
logical arguments for an early canonization of the text in the 19th century, it would be unfair
to criticize Vollers anachronistically for not taking this into account.

the Quran without (or with reduced) ʔiʕrāb was considered bad by third cen-
tury ah authorities, a time after the activity of most of the canonical reciters
had come to prominence can hardly be used as an argument that it was always
considered wrong.These narrations reveal something important: Later readers
and grammarians thought that any form of language could not be considered
al-ʕarabiyyah unless it was supplied with ʔiʕrāb, which being the maṣdar of
the C-stem of the root √ʕrb literally means “to make Arabic”. Therefore, there
is no al-ʕarabiyyah without ʔiʕrāb. It is not surprising that so few of the tradi-
tions seem to acknowledge a once existing form of Quranic Arabic that did not
have ʔiʕrāb even if it did exist; By the time the narrations were fabricated, and
certainly when the reading traditions are canonized with Ibn Muǧāhid in the
fourth Islamic century, the superiority of the ʕarabiyyah that had ʔiʕrāb/tanwīn
was well-established and completely unassailable.
Rabin (1955) criticizes Kahle’s argumentation, but misses his point. He is,
of course right, that the exhortations to not read the Quran without ʔiʕrāb,
and that laḥn is to be avoided does not prove that the language of the Quran
was without case. I do not believe that Kahle was arguing for this. What Kahle
aimed to show is that the very paradigm of reading the Quran, in this period
necessitated the used of ʔiʕrāb, any manner of reading without it, or not even
following the strict model presented by the readers-cum-(proto-)grammarians,
would by definition not be considered proper by the people who ended up
deciding what the norms of reading the Quran would be. With the narrations
broughtbyal-Farrāʔ,weareonegenerationremovedfromthecanonicalreader
and grammarian al-Kisāʔī, as well as Sībawayhi. In fact, Rabin and Kahle seem
to agree to a large extent, Rabin (1955, 27) says: “If, however, the language of the
Koran made concessions to the literary koinē, the ʿArabiyya, then it must needs
(sic) have accepted also the case-endings, that feature which was felt to be so
essential that it was called by the same word as the use of the language itself,
iʿrāb.”
Despite what Rabin seems to think, he and Kahle are not in disagreement
on this point. The disagreement stems from the fact that Rabin, and with him
many others, take for granted that the language of the Quran made these con-
cessions to the ʕarabiyyah already at the time of composition during the life-
time of the prophet. Rabin takes this for granted, believing that al-Farrāʔ, who
could not possibly conceive of the language of the Quran being anything but a
language with the ʔiʕrāb and tanwīn intact, is in fact correct in his inability to
conceive of this. That assumption, however, is never substantiated in any way.
The evidence of the qct, as I see it, rather speaks against it.
Looking for evidence in the reading traditions for traces of the original lan-
guage of the Quran in terms of the case system is therefore something that

is not possible as that was not the goal of the readers. What we can recover,
however, is evidence that the readers of the Quran were not trying to syllable-
for-syllable transmit the pronunciation as they received it from their teacher,
but instead, much like we saw in the previous chapter and chapter 3, sought
to beautify the language, and chose forms that they rationalized to be the cor-
rect pronunciation—even if that led to pseudocorrect readings. The choice of
ʔiʕrāb by the readers was part of their job, a rational endeavour and one where
different readers could and did have different intuitions and came to different
solutions.
A clear place where disagreements on ʔiʕrāb frequently occur between the
readers is on names of places and tribes, which may either occur as triptotes
or as diptotes in the classical language. Sībawayh (iii, 246–256) tells us that a
name of a people may either be triptotic if it refers either to the eponymous
father of a tribe or a ḥayy ‘clan’, while when it is diptotic, it refers to a qabīlah
‘tribe’. As Van Putten (forthcoming) shows, the distinction between ḥayy and
qabīlah does not seem to be based on any genealogical basis: both the primor-
dial confederacy of maʕadd and the famous tribe of qurayš, a tribe that belongs
to maʕadd are designated as ḥayy whereas tamīm is a qabīlah. The difference
between ḥayy and qabīlah comes down to formal characteristics. In the case
of a qabīlah the tribe as a whole is treated as dipotic while the eponymous
father is triptotic, and it can be denoted as ‘sons of [eponymous father]’, this
constitutes a qabīlah, e.g. Tamīmu ‘the tribe Tamīm’. Tamīmun ‘the eponymous
father of the tribe, Tamīm’, banū tamīmin ‘sons of Tamīm, the father = the tribe
Tamīm’. Such constructions cannot be formed with Qurayš, at least according
to Sībawayh, and this prescription seems to be adhered to quite faithfully even
today.6
For names of peoples or countries that occur in the Quran, however, the
practical context to make this distinction was lacking, and as a result the read-

whereas the other readers take it to be a triptote, sabaʔin. Indeed, if we look at
how this distinction is explained, e.g. by Ibn Xālawayh (Ḥuǧǧah, 270) he says:
“whoever treats it triptotic considers it to be the name of a mountain or the
name of the father of the tribe; whoever does not conjugate it, makes it to be
the name of a land or a woman, so it becomes heavy from the definiteness and

femininity.” In his book on what should be treated triptotic and what should
be treated diptotic, al-Zaǧǧāǧ (Mā Yanṣarif, 59) presents a different opinion:
“ʔabū ʕamr treats sabaʔ as a diptote, so he considers it to be the name of a tribe
(qabīlah).”
What should be clear from these treatments is that it is not actually known
by anyone what the proper treatment of this noun should be, and rather than
giving a consistent answer of what sabaʔ refers to—which of course should be
a land, the Sabaean kingdom—we get multiple solutions by the readers, seem-
ingly not based on any real knowledge of what the conjugation should be, but
rather through a rationalization from however the word should be conjugated.
This rationalization becomes even more obvious when it causes some con-
flict with the qct, namely with the name of the people of Thamud. This has
been discussed once before by Van Putten (forthcoming) but I will summarize
the discussion here. When we look at the qct, we find that ṯamūd functions
as a triptote. Whenever it stands in the nominative and genitive it is spelled
ثمودwhereas when it occurs in the accusative it is spelledثمودا
(Q11:68; Q25:38;
Q29:38; Q53:51), there is one exception to this in Q17:59اتينا ثمود الناقه مبصره
“and
we gave Thamud the she-camel as an evident (sign)”. For the latter exception
there are a variety of explanations.
Despite the clear behaviour of the qct of this word as triptotic, the canon-
ical readers display a rather mixed treatment. The readers invariably treat the
nominative as a diptote, reading ṯamūdu not ṯamūdun. The genitive is likewise
treated as a diptote, reading ṯamūda rather than ṯamūdin. There is a single
exception to this, which we will return to shortly. As for the accusative, most
readers follow the rasm suddenly switching categories for this noun, reading
it as ṯamūdan, but Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim, Ḥamzah and Yaʕqūb ignore the rasm and
read ṯamūda instead. Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim only follows them in the diptotic read-
ing in Q53:51 (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3298–3299). It is clear from these examples that
there is somewhat of a consensus between the readers that in principle ṯamūd
should be diptotic, but there is a difference of opinion as to whether one is free
to ignore the rasm when it is unambiguous in its triptosy.
Later discussions dutifully follow the distinction as presented by Sībawayh,
and cast this discussion into terms of ḥayy versus qabīlah, e.g. Ibn Xālawayh
(ḥujjah, 188): “whoever treats it as triptotic, there are two opinions (as to why):
one of them is: that he considers it to be the name of a ḥayy or a chieftain (of
a tribe), and the other is that they consider it to be a faʕūlan noun from the
root ṯmd, and this is a small amount of water. The one who treats it as a diptote
considers it to be the name of a qabīlah.”
This discussion of the much earlier al-Farrāʔ however, is very interesting
and quite different, and provides an explanation as to why his teacher al-Kisāʔī

reads the triptotic genitive ṯamūdin in Q11:68 only while he reads ṯamūda else-
where (al-Farrāʔ Maʕānī, ii, 20):
The reciters disagreed on ṯamūd: among them there were those who
treated it as triptotic in each case.7 As for those who treat it diptotic
in this case, Muḥammad ←al-Farrāʔ ←Qays ←ʔabū ʔisḥāq ←ʕabd al-
Raḥmān b. al-ʔaswad b.Yazīd al-Naxaʕī ←his father reports that he would
never treat ṯamūd as a triptote in the whole Quran, and Ḥamzah read it
thus. There are among them those who treat ṯamūd triptotically in the
accusative becauseitiswrittenwithan ʔalif inthewholeQuran, except
inone placeʔātaynāṯamūdan-nāqatamubṣirah(Q17:59),andthisiswhat
al-Kisāʔī adopted, he treated it triptotically in the accusative, and diptot-
ically in the genitive and nominative, except in one case, in his speech
ʔa-lā ʔinna ṯamūdan kafarū rabba-hum ʔa-lā buʕdan li-ṯamūdin (Q11:68)”.
So, they asked him about this and he said: “it is read with the genitive
of triptosy; it is ugly to have a word occur twice in two places (within
the same verse) and then have them disagree [on triptosy/dipotsy], so
I treated it [ṯamūdin] as a triptote because of it being close to it [ṯamū-
dan]. (emphasis my own)
This extraordinary discussion reveals a view of the transmission of the read-
ings strikingly different from how modern Islamic orthodoxy views the read-
ings.8 Al-Farrāʔ explains the existence of a reading being explicitly based on its
spelling, rather than the writing being seen as accommodating a preexistent
oral tradition. Second, he brings a report from his teacher who gives an explic-
itly aesthetic argument for his choice to readثمود
(Q11:68) as ṯamūdin rather
than ṯamūda.
While this account of course does not prove that the Quran was once com-
posed without ʔiʕrāb—for that we have to rely on the philological arguments
presented at the start of this section—what it does show is how readers them-
selves thought about their role in applying ʔiʕrāb in recitation. Their role was
not to faithfully verbatim the ʔiʕrāb as had been taught to them, but rather to

argue and rationalize why a word should have the ʔiʕrāb that they would give
it. In such cases even purely aesthetic arguments such as the one cited, was
apparently enough to deviate from the way their teacher taught it (Ḥamzah,
al-Kisāʔī’s direct teacher reads ṯamūda and li-ṯamūda in the relevant verse). As
such the application of ʔiʕrāb by these readers can tell us nothing at all about
the use of ʔiʕrāb of the original language of the qct. However, given that the
choice of ʔiʕrāb was a rational endeavour explicitly based on both the rasm
and aesthetic preference rather than prophetic example, it becomes quite easy
to envision that the presence of this very system was not original to the text,
but was rather imposed on it sometime after the standardization of the qct by
ʕuṯmān.
In some cases, we can see that to the readers certain words were no longer
transparently analysable, and as a result the application of case end up being
pseudocorrect. For example, the question word ʔayyāna ‘when?’ (Q7:187;
Q16:21; Q27:65; Q51:12; Q75:6; Q79:42) is universally read as such by the canoni-
cal readers.This wordis generally analysed as a CaC̄āC patternof a root√ʔy/wn
whence also ʔān ‘time’, which subsequently receives a final -a as other question
words such as ʔayna or perhaps denotations of time such as yawma ‘on the day’
and ḥīna ‘at the time’. However, this question word is clearly a univerbation of
ʔayya ʔānin ‘at which time?’, where the hamzah of ʔān was lost. This indeed
appears to have been recognized by al-Farrāʔ who is quoted in the Lisān al-
ʕarab (183a) as saying:
the base [ʔaṣl] of ʔayyāna is ʔayya ʔawānin, so they drop the vowel [ fa-
xaffafū] of the yāʔ of ʔayy and removed the hamzah of ʔawān, and then
and then the vowelless yāʔ and the wāw after it meet, so the wāw was
assimilated to the yāʔ, and he told this on the authority of al-Kisāʔī.
While it is probably better to derive the second part of ʔayyān from ʔān rather
than ʔawān,9 this etymology is, of course, otherwise the correct one. What
is interesting in the line of reasoning, however, is that at no point the final
short vowel is discussed. The explanation that is given would predict the form
ʔayyānin rather than the now recited ʔayyāna. Other grammarians, perhaps
for this reason, preferred different explanations for this word, but the fact
9 Al-Farrāʔ considered the origin (ʔaṣl) of ʔān to also be ʔawān (lisān al-ʕarab, 193b). The awk-
ward choice to argue from the form ʔawān to explain this form is typical of Arabic linguistic
thought, which does not like to take surface forms as input for a certain output, and instead
argues from the development of a kind of platonic ideal of the word (ʔaṣl) and how that word
leads to different surface forms.

remains that this is evidently the most straightforward etymology. However,
it only works if we assume that the case vowels were only applied later, and
that the form that yielded ʔayyāna was in fact /ayy ān/, or perhaps /ayya ān/
without the final case vowel, which was subsequently later applied to the word
/ayyān/ when it was no longer analysed as a compound phrase, yielding the
form ʔayyāna rather than the expected **ʔayyānin.
7.1
Lack of Final Short Vowels in the Reading Traditions
From the examples above, it should be clear that the placement of final short
vowels and tanwīn in the recitation of the Quran tells us very little about what
the situation was like in the original language of composition. Choosing ʔiʕrāb
was the duty of the reciter which could and did lead to disagreements among
the readers. The fact that readers all agree that the Quran is to be read with
ʔiʕrāb is part of the ideology that gave rise to the science of recitation in the
first place. Yet, from time-to-time we encounter isolated cases of words that
are unexpectedly read without final short vowels.
Considering how strongly reading without final short vowels was disfavored
by the grammarians early on, the very fact that such forms are transmitted at
all should probably be understood as a genuine attempt of transmitting earlier
forms otherwise lost to the tradition, as it is difficult to imagine how readers
would have chosen to innovate transmissions without case vowels on purpose.
Of course, the existence of such forms cannot prove that the original lan-
guage of the Quran lacked these final short vowels any more than their pres-
ence can—the only way to establish that is by going back to the qct—but the
existence of such transmissions does suggest that in the earliest times of the
transmission of the Quran, there were transmissions going around that had
forms without final short vowels. These transmissions have not come down as
complete readings, but like many other cases are simply retained as singular
lexical exceptions.
7.1.1
Sabaʔ
While most readers either treat the name of the South Arabian kingdom of
sabaʔ as a triptote or a diptote, there is also a transmission of Ibn Kaṯīr through
the canonical transmitter Qunbul (a teacher of Ibn Muǧāhid) who simply read
it without any ʔiʕrāb, i.e. sabaʔ rather than sabaʔa or sabaʔin in Q27:22 and
Q34:15 (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3803). Ibn Muǧāhid (480) considered this ʔiʕrābless
reading a mistake (wa-huwa wahm), affirming that the transmission of al-Bazzī
is the correct one, but despite that he also brings a single strand transmission

independent of Qunbul that likewise transmits this ʔiʕrābless form (Al-Ḥasan
b. Muḥammad b. ʕubayd aḷḷāh b. ʔabī yazīd ←Šibl ←Ibn Kaṯīr). It is interesting
to note that Al-Dānī seems disturbed enough by this, even in his al-Taysīr—a
book that normally does not spend much time explaining certain forms—that
he feels it is necessary to qualify why Qunbul would read it as such, saying that
it is “with the intention (for it to be) the pausal form” (ʕalā niyyati l-waqf ) (Al-
Dānī taysīr, 27).
This caseless transmission presents a problem for scholars who wish to
explain this form, as the grammatical framework that the grammarians have
set up do not normally allow for the absence of any inflection in the middle of
a verse, and as such only post hoc explanations are adduced. For example, Ibn
Xālawayh (Ḥuǧǧah, 270) says: “whoever quiesces the hamzah would say: This
noun is feminine, and that is heavier than masculine; it is definite, and that is
heavier than indefinite; it is hamzated and that is heavier than not having a
hamzah, as these features come together in the noun that we have mentioned,
the heaviness is lessened by quiescence of the final short vowel.”
7.1.2
As-sayyiʔ
The noun as-sayyiʔالسيا10 occurs in its definite form twice in the same verse
(Q35:43). Ḥamzah reads the first occurrence without ʔiʕrāb, i.e. as-sayyiʔ, while
the second one is read as as-sayyiʔu (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3991). It should be noted
here that one cannot argue that this is a pausal pronunciation, as Ḥamzah
drops the hamzah in pause, i.e. as-sayyī, a distinction specifically commented
on with regard to this verse by al-Dānī (taysīr, 182f.)
Ibn Xālawayh (Ḥujjah, 297) cannot use the same argumentation why this
formiscaselessashedidforsabaʔ,asthisnounisnotfeminine.Instead,hesug-
gests that it was “lightened” because of the meeting of two kasrahs in a row. He

7.1.4
Yā-bunay
There is disagreement among the readers on how to readيبنى
‘o my son’ in its
sixattestations(Q11:42;Q12:5;Q31:13,16,17;Q37:102)(Ibnal-Ǧazarī,§3291).Ḥafṣ
ʕan ʕāṣim read it as yā-bunay-ya whenever it occurred. Šuʕbah ʕan ʕāṣim fol-
lows him in Q13:13 and Q31:17 only. In all other cases he read yā-bunayy-i with
the more typical shortened vocative 1sg. ending -i as also found inيابتyā-ʔabat-
i ‘o my father’,يربyā-rabb-i ‘o my lord’,يقومyā-qawm-i ‘o my people’. All other
readers follow the reading yā-bunayy-i instead.
For Ibn Kaṯīr, there is an exception, he specifically reads Q31:13 as yā-bunay,
without final -i, nor with gemination of the final consonant. It might be that it
simply means ‘O son!’ rather than ‘O my son’, but even in that case one would
have expected yā-bunayyu rather than no case vowel at all. This is therefore
clearly an uninflected form in Ibn Kaṯīr’s reading. This ʔiʕrābless form occurs
again in Q31:17, which is read as yā-bunay by Qunbul whereas Ibn Kaṯīr’s other
canonical transmitter, Al-Bazzī reads it as yā-bunay-ya, while he usually read
yā-bunayy-i elsewhere.
7.1.5
Yartaʕ/nartaʕ
An interesting case of the loss of final short vowels isٮرتع
(Q12:12). This is read
by most readers as a jussive yartaʕ or nartaʕ, and is taken to be from a root
√rtʕ which in this G-stem supposedly means ‘to graze’ and figuratively ‘to revel,
indulge freely (in)’. However, several readers read it as the jussive Gt-stem of
raʕā ‘to pasture’, i.e. nartaʕi (Ibn Kaṯīr) or yartaʕi (Abū Ǧaʕfar and Nāfiʕ).11
irtaʕā ‘to graze; pasture’ and rataʕa ‘to graze; to revel’ are obviously related
and the latter must be considered a reanalysis of the former. This, however, is
only possible from a stage of the language where final short vowels were lost.
In Quranic Arabic, final long ī is lost completely in pause, and such shortened
forms are occasionally also used outside of pause (van Putten and Stokes 2018,
156ff.). The imperfective of irtaʕā would thus be yartaʕī or yartaʕ and in pause
exclusively yartaʕ#. The jussive form would always be yartaʕ. These shortened
forms without final short vowels in the prefix conjugation look identical to the
prefix conjugation of a verb derived from a root √rtʕ. The root √rtʕ must be

and Nāfiʕ read yartaʕ and that the Ibn Kaṯīr and Nāfiʕ read it with a final i, i.e. nartaʕi and
yartaʕi respectively. Abū Ǧaʕfar also reads it with the final i (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, 293).

195
the result of a reanalysis of the prefix conjugation yartaʕ, which allowed for a
reanalysis that is only readily possible in a variety of Arabic that has lost final
short vowels.12 We must therefore see the root √rtʕ as an artifact of grammati-
cal thought of the Arab grammarians who were confronted with the reading
yartaʕ lacking final short vowels—a form which would be incorrect in the
Arabic which retained final short vowels—unless it was the jussive of a non-
existent root √rtʕ. From there a new verb with this root √rtʕ was coined. This
reanalysis is unlikely to have happened in a variety that had full ʔiʕrāb present,
as the jussive yartaʕi is not homophonous to **yartaʕ.
7.1.6
Tatran, tatrā, tatrē
An example where the readers show disagreement on whether a noun should
havetanwīnornotcanbefoundinتترا
‘oneafteranother,insuccession’(Q23:44)
which is read by Ibn Kaṯīr, ʔabū ʕamr and ʔabū Ǧaʕfar as tatran, whereas the
rest reads it as tatrā or tatrē, depending on whether they apply ʔimālah to
the -ā feminine suffix (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3690). Traditionally this word is inter-
preted as either a CaCC derivation of watira ‘to string’ or a CaCCā derivation
of the same (Ibn Xālawayh Ḥuǧǧah, 257). The initial t is explained as an alter-
nation of w and t in the way that we see it in turāṯ‘inheritance’ from wariṯa
‘to inherit’, but such an explanation in either case is not particularly attrac-
tive.This w/t-alternation is otherwise only found in in tuCāC and tuCaCah (e.g.
tuxamah‘indigestion’)derivationsfromI-wverbs(Fischer2002,§240.3).What-
ever the actual derivation of this noun, it is clear that because of the obscurity
of this hapax legomenon and its derivation, readers could not agree whether
the word was to have tanwīn or not, and hence we are confronted with both
options.13

Tuḍār

also readيضار
(Q2:282) without ʔiʕrāb.14 (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2774).
12
The root √rtʕ also lacks Semitic cognates, unlike, raʕā which is easily reconstructible for
Proto-Semitic as *raʕaya (cf. Aram. rʕā ‘to grave; pasture’; Hebr. råʕå; Gz. raʕaya; asa rʕy;
Akk. reʔû).

7.1.8
The 3sg.m. Suffix -h
A striking category of words that lack expected final (long!) vowels in the
Quranic reading traditions are the final weak verbs that occur in the apoc-
opate or imperative followed by the third person masculine clitic pronoun
-hū/-hī. Verbs of this type occur sixteen times in the Quran, and every single
one of them is reported among at least one of the canonical readers with-
out the expected final vowel, and occasionally with a short form -hi/hu rather
than -hī/hū.There is a good amount of disagreement among different works on
the Qirāʔāt, for simplicity’s sake, the following table is based on Ibn al-Ǧazarī
(§1213–1219).

classicized hijazi: final short vowels and tanwīn
197
It is possible to make several generalizations on the basis of this table. First,
al-Kisāʔī,Xalaf andIbnKaṯīrdonotshowanyunusualbehaviourintheseverbs,
and simply follow their general rules of the pronouns. Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ follows
them almost completely, only making an exception at yarḍa-hu.
Yaʕqūb consistently treats these apocopates/imperatives that have a final
-i as if they ended in final -ī, and therefore vowel length disharmony is trig-
gered.This behaviour is reminiscent of another part of his reading that we have
discussed earlier (§3.6.3): Yaʕqūb does not harmonize the third person plural
suffix -hum to -him if ay or ī precede. Rawḥʕan Yaʕqūb likewise treats apoco-
pates as if they ended in final -ī and does not apply vowel harmony either. This
parallel is unlikely to be a coincidence.
Qālūn ʕan Nāfiʕ, like Yaʕqūb consistently has a short pronominal form after
apocopates that end in -hi. Unlike Yaʕqūb, Qālūn has no other examples where
heseemstotreatapocopate-iasif itwereī.ForQālūnwithapocopatesthatend
in -a length disharmony does not get triggered either, although there are trans-
missions for Yaʕqūb that lack it too, and thus we see yara-hū (Q90:7; Q99:7, 8).
But for yarḍa-hu (Q39:7), like Warš he has a short vowel.
Taking the imperfect as the basis of the vowel length disharmony rule is
indeed how it is explained in Ḥuǧǧah literature, Ibn Xālawayh (Ḥuǧǧah, 111)
for example says: “those who pronounce the vowel (of -hV) short take the base
(ʔaṣl) of it to be yuʔaddī-hi, and then the yāʔ disappears because of it being
an apocopate, and the shortened vowel remains because of what its base (ʔaṣl)
was.”
This type of reading however, can hardly be understood as the outcome of
naturallanguage.Theruleof voweldisharmonynotbeingaffectedbytheshort-
ening of the ī is imaginable if the vowel-length disharmony of the pronominal
suffix predates the shortening of the vowel in the apocopate. The phonological
process would then have been phonologized due to this development. How-
ever, the order of development is reversed: apocopate forms of the verb go
at least as far back as Proto-West-Semitic, evidence of them being present,
for example, in Hebrew (yiḇnī ‘he builds’ way-yiḇɛn ‘and he built’ < *yabniyu,
*yabni), whereas it seems clear that the vowel length disharmony is a (Classi-
cal) Arabic internal development. The use of the short form of the pronoun,
therefore should be considered an explicit grammarian rationalization from
the view that apocopates are shortened forms of the imperfective, rather than
a natural outcome of the language.
The vowelless forms as found in the readings of Šuʕbah, Ḥamzah, ʔabū ʕamr
and ʔabū Ǧaʕfar rather appear as overzealous application of the grammatical
rules of apocopation. All of them more-or-less consistently have no vowel on
the pronoun at all on the apocopates that end in in -i.

chapter 7
What this seems to stem from is that all of these readers start with a surface
imperfective form, e.g. yattaqī-hi, and subsequently apply the rule to make an
apocopate form to both parts of the word, shortening final -ī and dropping final
-i. Indeed al-Farrāʔ (Maʕānī, i, 224) was aware that some readers seem to view
it as such, although he considers it a mistake:
Al-ʔaʕmaš and ʕāṣim used to drop the vowel of the hāʔ in yuʔaddi-h,
yuwalli-h mā tawallī, ʔarǧi-h wa-ʔaxā-hu, xayran yara-h,15 šarran yara-h.
And there are two ways of viewing this for them [wa-fīhi la-humā maḏha-
bān]: One of these is that the people considered it to be the apocopate of
the hāʔ, in fact [what is apocopated] is in front of the hāʔ. So, this—if it
is the case that they supposed that—is a mistake.
The second option that al-Farrāʔ presents, however, is not particularly con-
vincing as an explanation of these forms. He gives cases where Arabs may
pronounce the pronoun as -h, but none of the cases he cites account for the
environment in which we see this behaviour:
As for the other option, either there are among the Arabs those who apoc-
opate the hāʔ when there is a short vowel before it. So, they say: ḍarabtu-h
ḍarban šadīdā, or one removes from the hāʔ the rafʕ of its base as is the
case with raʔaytum and ʔantum. Do you not see that the mīm is quiesced
while its base is rafʕ [In al-Farrāʔ’s framework, the base of these words is
raʔaytumū and ʔantumū]?
Al-Farrāʔ is clearly bothered by the first explanation, as it evidently stems from
ignorance of the grammatical model the grammarians—him included—rely
upon, but it is also evidently less ad hoc than his other option, which does
not explain at all why these shortened formed only occur specifically with the
imperative and apocopate of iii-y/w verbs.
It might be possible that the origin of this overzealous application of this
rule may have to do with transmissions that originally lacked final short vowels.
In the nascent period of grammatical theory—readers like al-ʔaʕmaš (d. 148)
and ʕāṣim (d. 127) predate Sībawayh by one to two generations—it seems pos-
sible that in other contexts the application of the apocopation rules was less
15
This reading has not come down to us through transmissions of the canonical readers.
Al-Farrāʔ usually appears to report ʕāṣim’s reading from Šuʕbah.

ambiguous than with the final weak verbs, and therefore these were classicized
properly,whereasthefinalweakverbswentundertheradarandtheirquiescent
forms were retained.
There are some irregularities among the readers with fully vowelless forms,
but Ibn Muǧāhid (211f.) reports a zero vowel for every form for Ḥamzah →al-
Kisāʔī →al-Farrāʔ and ʕāṣim →Šuʕbah →Yaḥyā b. ʔādam. The latter is also
reported by al-Farrāʔ in his Maʕānī and is likely to have been the original trans-
mission, considering how close al-Farrāʔ is to the source. There do not seem to
be transmissions on ʔabū ʕamr’s authority with short vowels however. Al-Dānī
(Ǧāmiʕ, 457), however, does bring reports of the expected form yara-h for al-
Dūrī ←ʔabū ʕamr.
An obvious explanation for the exceptional status of the forms yara-hū is
that two of the three cases stand in a rhyme position. It is likely that the
original transmission simply transmitted these forms in their pausal for yara-
h—the natural pronunciation in this position—and only on further inquiry
by later transmitters, were non-pausal forms invented, this time not following
the overzealous apocopation rule of the early readers, but rather one that sim-
ply followed the Classical Arabic rules, which would generate yara-hū, the one
other case of yara-hū subsequently followed suit.
A truly baffling transmission is the reading of Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim ofيتقه
‘fears
him’ (Q24:52).While the other readers have yattaqi-h(i/ī), as one would expect,
Ḥafṣdrops the short vowel of the jussive altogether, while retaining a short
harmonized form of the pronoun. There does not seem to be an obvious way
to account for such a form from Classical Arabic grammar. The most obvious
explanation is that it comes from an underlying form yattaq-h where the final i
is epenthetic to avoid a word-final two consonant cluster—something avoided
in Classical Arabic. This is the explanation given by Ibn Xālawayh (Ḥuǧǧah,
263), the reason why the apocopate would have lost the final i-vowel in this
position, however, can only be explained by deriving it from a variety where at
least in some positions the apocopate of final weak verbs lost the final -i, pre-
sumably a dialect which (at least) lost the final short vowel -i,16 which was then
analogically spread to non-final position. Indeed, Ibn Xālawayh seems to attest
the existence of such a form, citing a line of poetry that has the form yattaq.
All the specific complexities and disagreements of these forms aside, it is
clear that there was great disagreement on how to treat these cases, something
that is difficult to imagine if the Quran had been transmitted in its predictable
16
Blau (1977, 15f.) seems to suggest that the Meccan dialect would have been such an old
Arabic dialect.

classical form. Both the forms with long vowels -hū/ī and -hu/i can be under-
stood as later grammarian intervention, especially the latter being dependent
on specific grammatical analysis that cannot be thought to have existed before
the rise of Arabic grammatical theory. The -h forms, however, are clearly the
lectio difficilior here. While it can certainly be envisioned that these too were
generated by nascent grammatical theory with an overapplication of apoco-
pation rules, it also seems possible that simply original transmissions without
final short vowels shine through here instead.
7.1.9
The Mysterious Letters
A special case of words being unexpectedly pronounced without any form of
ʔiʕrāb in the reading traditions are the mysterious letters at the beginning of
Sūrahs. The names of the letters in Classical Arabic are simply inflected, just
like any other noun in the language, and in principle there is no reason why
المwould not be read as ʔalifun lāmun mīmun, but instead all of the letters
are universally read without their inflectional endings. This could perhaps be
understood as pausal pronunciations of these letters, and this is how ʔabū Ǧaʕ-
far treats them, who introduces a pause after every single mysterious letter (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §1592).The restof the readers,however simply treatthese wordsas if
they are nouns that lack all inflection, and pronouncethem in context.As such,
these letters may even undergo assimilation with each other, and the following
words, e.g. Q26:1, Q28:1طسمis pronounced with assimilation of the n of sīn to
the m of the following word by most readers (see Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1907–1917 for
a full discussion).
The form of the mysterious letters is fairly easy to understand from a situ-
ation that started out as lacking inflectional endings, which were classicized.
As these mysterious letters have no obvious syntactical function, it is difficult
to classicize these into an inflectional paradigm. The inverse, however, is more
difficult to understand. There is no reason why the mysterious letters would be
uninflected, if the base language of the Quran was inflected.
7.2
Was ʔabū ʕamr’s Reading an ʔiʕrāb-less Reading?
The most recent work on the potential absence of case in a reading tradition
of the Quran, and by extension the possible caselessness of an Ur-Quran was
put forward by Jonathan Owens (2006, 119–136), who argues that the reading
of ʔabū ʕamr originally represented a reading tradition that did not inflect for
case, and was only later classicized to have case. This is essentially a continu-
ation and further elaboration of Vollers’ (1906) original theory concerning this

topic, bringing to bear modern linguistic insights in understanding ʔabū ʕamr’s
phenomenon on ‘Major Assimilation’ (al-ʔidġām al-kabīr), i.e. assimilation of
consonants across word boundaries, even when there is an intervening short
vowel. If Owens’ argument is correct, it would mean that it is not just the qct
(as argued by van Putten and Stokes 2018), but even one of its canonical read-
ings that originally lacked the case system of Classical Arabic. However, the
arguments put forward by Owens are not quite convincing, as we will see in
the following sections. The major assimilation of ʔabū ʕamr is not as alien to
the model of the grammarians as Owens makes it out to be, and I will show
that ʔabū ʕamr’s reading can only be understood if we assume the underlying
presence of some kind of case system as part of his system.
7.2.1
Al-ʔidġām al-kabīr
All reading traditions of the Quran have some amount of assimilation across
word boundaries, but this usually only happens with tanwīn or consonants that
are not followed by a vowel. ʔabū ʕamr’s reading is unique in that it frequently
occurs across word boundaries when there is an intervening short vowel, yield-
ing forms such as: qāla rabbu-kum →qārrabbukum (Owens 2006, 127).
Such assimilations take place when either the final consonant of the first
word and the first consonant of the second word are identical, or close in terms
of place of articulation. Owens represents this Major Assimilation through two
rules, where Ca is an ‘assimilatable’ consonant:
1.
C1av̆ #C2a →C1a #C2a
2.
C1a #C2a →C2aC2a
He considers these rules “linguistically odd”, as rule 2 cannot precede rule 1, but
rule1onlyapplieswhen2alsoapplies(Owens2006,130).17Assuch,rule1seems
to anticipate rule number 2 before it has taken place. The dependency of rule
2 on rule 1 prompts Owens to suggest that rule 1 was not originally operative,
and that the base form simply lacked the case vowels that are elided through
this rule. Later classicization would then have included these case vowels into
the reading, wherever assimilation did not prevent this from happening.
17
While the kind of ‘permeability’ of final vowels for assimilation is certainly rare, the
Awadhi language (and Eastern-Hindi language, spoken in India and Nepal) provides a
strikingly close parallel to ʔabū ʕamr’s major assimilation. Awadhi as three short high
vowels /i/, /u/ and /e/, which are devoiced in word-final position. When these vowels
stand between two consonants with the same place of articulation they are syncopated.
Depending on the consonants that come to stand next to each other, this may subse-
quently lead to further assimilations, e.g. bɦɑːgi gʌwɑː →bɦɑːggʌwɑː ‘ran away’, bɦɑːtu
dɑːri̥→bɦɑːddɑːri̥‘rice and pulse’, cʌli diɦɑː →cʌldiɦɑː ‘started’ (Saksena 1937, 94). I thank
Hamza Khwaja for providing me with this reference.

chapter 7
I have trouble seeing why the rules as formulated by Owens are “linguisti-
cally odd”. Major assimilation of this type occurs frequently in the Quran and
its readings—albeit irregularly, and contrary to Owens’ (2006, 130) claim, it
is covered quite extensively by Sībawayh. Returning back to the assimilation
rules 1 and 2, Owens says: “For Sibawayh, then type (8a) [rule 1, MvP] applies
within words, and between words only when the two consonants are identi-
cal; (8b) [rule 2, MvP] applies across word boundaries, with an input in which
two consonants abut one another.” (Owens 2006, 131). For the example of the
assimilationhappeningwithinaword,Owenscites yaqtatil→yaqittil.However,
his claim that such assimilations are only described by Sībawayh when they
involve identical consonants, is incorrect. In fact, on the very page that Owens
cites for the assimilation yaqtatil →yaqittil (Sībawayh in the Derenbourg edi-
tion, vol. ii, 459) there are three examples of this assimilation where the assim-
ilation happens within a word where the two consonants are not identical.
Sībawayh cites here irtadafa →raddafa, al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī’s reading ixtaṭafa
→ʔillā man xaṭṭafa l-xaṭfah (Q37:10);18 and a reading of the people of Mecca
murtadifīna →muruddifīna (Q8:9).19 This is far from the only time that Sīb-
awayh discusses this kind of development happening within word-boundaries.
Other examples he cites are: yatasammaʕūna →lā yassamaʕūna (Sībawayh
iv, 463),20 ṯalāṯatu darāhima/ʔaflusin →ṯalāttu (Sībawayh iv, 464), yataṣāl-
iḥā →yaṣṣāliḥā (Sībawayh iv, 467),21 yaxtaṣimūna →yaxaṣṣimūna (Q36:49),
yataṭawwaʕūna →yaṭṭawwaʕūna, yataḏakkarūna →yaḏḏakkarūna (Q2:121 and
others), yataṭayyarū →yaṭṭayyarū bi-mūsā (Q7:131), taṭawwaʕa →iṭṭawwaʕa,
taḏakkara →iḏḏakkara, tadāraʔtum →fa-ddāraʔtum fīhā (Q2:72), tazayyanat
→wa-zzayyanat (Q10:24), tazayyunan →izzayyunan, taddāruʔan →iddāruʔan,
taṭayyarnā →iṭṭayarnā bika (Q27:47), also the acceptability of yahtadūna →
yahiddūna is implied, though not explicitly mentioned22 (Sībawayh iv, 474–
475).
Admittedly, Sībawayh cites very few examples of major assimilation of dis-
similar consonats across word boundaries, although I have found one example.
18
Recorded by Ibn Xālawayh (muxtaṣar, 127) as xiṭṭifa for al-Ḥasan, Qatādah and ʕīsā.
19
The Meccan Ibn Kaṯīr simply reads murdifīna (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3169).
20
He is citing Q37:8لا يسمعونhere, which is read by Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim, Ḥamzah, al-Kisāʔī
and Xalaf as an assimilated tD-stem, where the rest reads it as yasmaʕūna (Ibn al-Ǧazarī
§4030). His comments that “unassimilated is proper Arabic” should perhaps be seen as a
subtle jab at the Kufans.
21
Sībawayh cites Q4:128يصلحاhere, which is read by most readers as yaṣṣāliḥā, only the four
Kufans read yuṣliḥā (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §2961).

But compare the Quranic reading Q10:35 yahiddī, yahaddī, yahăddī, yahddī, yihiddī
(besides yahdī) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §3256).

203
Sībawayh (iv, 450) cites the assimilation of ʕ to h, in which case both con-
sonants are shifted to ḥ. Here he cites both word-internal and word-external
examples maʕa-hum ‘with them’ →maḥḥum and maʕa hāʔulāʔi ‘with these’ →
maḥḥāʔulāʔi a feature specifically attributed to the Banū Tamīm. On the same
page he also cites a line of poetry which underwent masḥi-hī ‘his anointment’→
masḥḥī (→masḥī?).
The absence of extensive assimilation of this type across word-boundaries,
however, does not help Owens’ argument. Owens’ main objection to the pos-
sibility that such an assimilation took place against word boundaries is that
it does not take place word-internally, the above examples should make abun-
dantly clear that they do. Where across word-boundaries we may doubt
whether the underlying form had an intervening vowel, we cannot make this
case for the word-internal cases. So, whether this assimilation across vowel
is “linguistically odd” or not, it is evident that it is happening, even in word-
internal position, and therefore it is difficult to invoke this intuition as an argu-
ment against the presence of intervening short vowels.
Nöldeke was therefore right to dismiss Vollers’ use of major assimilation as
evidence for the complete absence of ʔiʕrāb, and Owens has not made a com-
pelling case against it. Moreover, the presence of clear cases of word-internal
major assimilation in the qct (there are many more examples besides those
that Sībawayh cites,see also AppendixA.3.5) provethat wearenot dealingwith
Sībawayh’s grammatical invention, but with actually attested linguistic forms.
Whilemajorassimilationinʔabūʕamr’sreadingcannotserveasevidencefor
the absence of case vowels, it certainly does not prove that they existed either.
However, there are several other features of ʔabū ʕamr’s reading that clearly
require us to presuppose the presence of case vowels, which we will look at in
more detail in the following sections.
7.2.2
I-umlaut
Many other aspects of ʔabū ʕamr’s reading are dependent upon the presence
of case vowels, as admitted by Owens himself (Owens 2006, 132). One of these
is the ʔimālah of any stem-final ār (see §3.6.2).23 Whenever stem-final ār is
followed by i (but not ī),24 e.g. an-nāri > an-nēri (Q2:39); kaffārin > kaffērin
23
Note that this means that stem internal āri sequences do not undergo ʔimālah, so bāridun
(Q38:42) is not read with ʔimālah. It explicitly applies only if the r is the third root conso-
nant (see also §3.6.2).
24
There is one verse specific exception, on which thransmitters of ʔabū ʕamr disagreed: al-
ǧāri (Q4:36, both occurrences) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2050).

chapter 7
(Q2:276). This i-umlaut operates even if al-ʔidġām al-kabīr causes the trigger-
ing kasrah to be dropped hence ʕalā l-kuffāri ruḥamāʔu > ʕalalkuffērruḥamāʔu
(Q48:29) (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1192). The underlying phonological representation
therefore needs the presence of the case vowel, despite its absence in the sur-
face form.
7.2.3
Rawm and ʔišmām
Owens (2006, 132ff.) suggests that the use of ʔišmām and rawm in ʔabū ʕamr’s
reading point to more examples of reduced case distinction. However, they
actually show the opposite. Owens’ position seems to stem from a misunder-
standing of his sources.The first misunderstanding seems to be what these two
terms mean and the second is where they occur. Owens labels rawm as ‘labial-
ization’ and ʔišmām as ‘fronting and rounding’. This is incorrect.25 It is helpful
to cite ʔabū ʕamr al-Dānī’s description of the two concepts here, which I find
particularly clear (al-Dānī taysīr, 58f.).26
As for the meaning of rawm:it is when youweakenthe sound of the vowel
until it has gone almost completely, so that you will hear it as a concealed
sound. A blind person can perceive it with his sense of hearing.
As for the meaning of ʔišmām: you bunch up your lips after the, orig-
inally, vowelless (final) letter. A blind person cannot perceive that infor-
mation, because it is seen with the eye and nothing else.
In other words: rawm denotes ultra-short vowels while ʔišmām is labialization,
and indeed this is how it is taught today. It is true that ʔabū ʕamr has the option
to use rawm and ʔišmām, but it is incorrect that these neutralize short high
vowels. Again, it pays to look at the descriptions of the Qirāʔāt works, al-Dānī
continues:

Confusion on this topic is understandable, the terminology has been used in different
ways by different grammarians. Ibn al-Ǧazarī for example reports that the Kufan gram-
mariansusedthetwotermsintheoppositemannerfromthegeneraldiscussion(iii,1863),
and that the use of the term rawm had a slightly different meaning amongst the gram-
marians than among the readers (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, iii, 1878; §2295). Needless to say, when
discussing the terminology in the context of ʔabū ʕamr’s reading, we should be sticking to
thewaythattherecitersuseit.AsfarascanbegleanedfromSībawayh’s(iv,168ff.)descrip-
tion, it seems to mostly agree with what the readers say (except for him also fatḥah can
undergo rawm). While neither rawm and ʔišmām is explicitly defined, it is pointed out
that ʔišmām only applies with ḍammah.
26
But other descriptions leave no doubt that they are in fact the same, there is no difference
of opinion between Ibn al-Ǧazarī (§2277, §2278) and al-Dānī here.

As for ʔišmām, it only occurs for the rafʕ and ḍammah, and nothing
else.
In other words when rawm is applied, it is to u and i and there is, in fact, no
neutralization: u is articulated as ŭ and i as ĭ. As for ʔišmām it is sensibly only
used for the nominative and imperfect. When a reciter decides to recite with
rawm or ʔišmām, they are applied whenever the context allows, while, when
the context does not, the recitation resorts back to full assimilation. So rather
than neutralizing distinctions it in fact creates more distinctions not present if

to ʔidġām only. It should also be added that, when ʔabū ʕamr opts for rawm, the
consonants are not actually assimilated. Keeping this in mind, Owens’ (2006,
133) example qaalarabb-u-kum →**qaarʷrabbukum does not occur at all. Even
when opting to include ʔišmām or rawm in recitation this would always be pro-
nounced with assimilation and no labialization: qārrabbukum.The table below

Owens’ confusion about the terminology here is understandable, as Ibn Muǧā-
hid (156) uses the verb ʔašamma in a non-technical way in some places of
his discussion. For example, on the discussion of the words yuʕallimu-hum
(Q2:129) and yalʕanu-hum (Q2:159) he says that, in a transmission of ʕalī al-
Hāšimī, ʔabū ʕamr “used to give taste (yušimmu) to the mīm of yuʕallimu-hum
and the nūn of yalʕanu-hum—bothbeforethe hāʔ—of ḍamm withoutfullpro-
nunciation (ʔišbāʕ) and it is like that for ʕan ʔasliḥati-kum wa-ʔamtiʕati-kum
(Q4:102), he gives a little bit of the taste to the tāʔ for both of them of the ǧarr”.
The fact that Ibn Muǧāhid makes a distinction here between giving the taste

Technically speaking the vowel ā may be pronounced overlong, i.e. qāārrabbukum, as long
vowels before long consonants are regularly lengthened.

of the vowel u and i suggests first of all that we are not dealing with ʔišmām in
the technical sense (which cannot apply to u), but also that these vowels were
distinct (i.e. it is rawm) and it is not merged into a single epenthetic vowel ə as
Owens suggests.
7.2.4
Tanwīn Blocks Assimilation
Whenever a noun has tanwīn, al-ʔidġām al-kabīr cannot operate.This is explic-
itly stipulated for ʔabū ʕamr’s assimilation rules by ibn Muǧāhid (117). When-
ever tanwīn is present, case vowels are also present. It seems possible to argue
that a caseless version of ʔabū ʕamr’s reading had tanwīn but no distinction
between case vowels before it. In that case, ʔabū ʕamr’s reading would be sim-
ilar to modern dialects with ‘dialectal tanwīn’ (Stokes 2020). There is however
nothing to indicate that this is the case, and the i-umlaut ʔimālah still cause by
the genitive case in the indefinite rather argues against this.
7.2.5
A Non-literalist Reading of ʔabū ʕamr’s Traditions
Owens admits the problems with his theory brought up by the i-umlaut and
tanwīn. But, he argues for a “non-literalist” reading of ʔabū ʕamr’s tradition:
“Against a literalist reading, I would argue that the status of many grammati-
cal elements in the Qiraaʔaat tradition still awaits comparative treatment, and
that in some instances reconstructed forms may be necessary, which are not
attested directly in any single variant” (Owens 2006, 132). While the complete
transmission of ʔabū ʕamr indeed only first appears in the fourth century ah,28
several centuries after ʔabū ʕamr’s lifetime (d. 154ah), the transmissions of
his reading among different authorities are independent enough that we can
be reasonably confident that the features, along with those that require the
presence of case vowels can be confidently attributed to him. Nevertheless, I
believethatOwensdoesobservesomethingimportantinhisdiscussionof ʔabū
ʕamr’s recitation, and that his “non-literalist reading” of the tradition is war-
ranted. Througout ʔabū ʕamr’s reading along with traces in Ibn Kaṯīr’s reading
we see a fairly frequent cases of syncope (or ultrashort realization) of the ʔiʕrāb
vowels i and u in phonetically very similar environments. While for neither
reader this syncope is regular, the conditioning in which it occurs is consistent,
and seems to reflect at least a memory of a variety of Arabic that had a case
system quite distinct from that of Classical Arabic. Thus, Ibn Muǧāhid (155f.)
28
Ibn Muǧāhid’s description is in fact extremely short and of little help to a person who
would want to recite ʔabū ʕamr’s reading with assimilation. His student Ibn Xālawayh has
a more detailed description, which does not differ significantly from later descriptions
(Ibn Xālawayh Badīʕ, 307–317).

mentions several cases where word-final u and i are either pronounced ultra-
short (ŭ or ĭ) or syncopated altogether whenever heavy pronomonial suffixes
follow,29 e.g. bāriʔ(ĭ)-kum (Q2:54), yaʔmur(ŭ)-kum (Q2:67), yuʕallim(ŭ)-hum,
yalʕan(ŭ)-hum, ʕan ʔasliḥatĭ-kum wa-ʔamtiʕatĭ-kum (Q2:102), and yaǧmaʕ(ŭ)-
kum (Q64:9).30 Among his canonical transmissions there are many more cases
of shortening like this, and even complete loss of ʔiʕrāb is reported. This is
broadly transmitted for the words bāriʔ(ĭ)-kum, yaʔmur(ŭ)-kum, yaʔmur(ŭ)-
hum, yanṣur(ŭ)-kum and yanšir(ŭ)-kum whenever they occur (al-Dānī taysīr,
73), but Ibn al-Ǧazarī (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2655) brings marginal transmissions
of many more cases, some even transmitting that every verb that ends in -
ru-h/kum loses or makes ultrashort the mood ending of the verb. Traces of a
similar process can also be found in the canonical transmissions of ʔabū ʕamr’s
Meccan teacher Ibn Kaṯīr who read ʔar-nā (Q2:128; Q4:153; Q41:29) and ʔar-nī
(Q2:260; Q7:143), for the C-stem imperative of of raʔā, and ʔabū ʕamr follows
himinthisaswell,thoughsometransmitanultrashortvowelʔarĭ-nā/nī instead
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2728). It is worth pointing out that Ibn Muḥayṣin, one of ʔabū
ʕamr’s other Meccan teachers and one of the 4 pseudo-canonical readers after
the 10, seems to have had a much more regular application of this syncope than
either ʔabū ʕamr or Ibn Kaṯīr (Sabṭal-Xayyāṭal-Mubhiǧ, ii, 370).31
Whilethissystemisnotregular,itseemsclearthatthetracesthatarepresent
here are related to a phenomenon that is reported as a dialectal tendency of
Tamīm and ʔasad, which happens, according to al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 30) “because
of the continuous succession of vowels” (tawālī al-ḥarakāt) citing forms such
as yaʔmur-kum, yaḥzun-hum, ʔa-nuzlim-kumū-hā, ʔaḥad-hum, ʔaḥad-humā, li-
ʔaḥad-himā. He explicitly points out that “the people of the Hijaz pronounce
this clearly and do not weaken it, and this is the more preferable of the two
options to me (wa-huwa ʔaḥabbu l-waǧhayni ʔilayya).” Considering that this
only affects the high vowels u and i, among Najdi tribes, it seems that this
should be considered to be part of the broader syncopating tendencies of u
and i among these tribes (as discussed in §2.2.4 and §3.3.2). In this pattern, it
seems worthwhile to also mention the existence of a different type of syncope
before heavy suffixes in ʔabū ʕamr’s reading, that is the syncope of the vowel
29
The opinion that ʔabū ʕamr pronounced these vowels ultrashort rather than syncopating
them altogether seems to be an ancient one. Even Sībawayh (iv, 202) already explicitly
mentions the reading of ʔabū ʕamr bāriʔĭkum with an ultrashort vowel.
30
n.b. explicitly without neutralization of these short vowels.

Ibn al-Ǧazarī (iv, 2165) cites Ibn Muḥayṣin as reading yuʕallim-hum, naḥšur-hum and
ʔaḥad-humā (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, iv, 2165). I have been unable to find reports of the reading
ʔaḥad-humā for Ibn Muḥayṣin.

before the case vowel of subul and rusul (and in a non-canonical transmission
nuzul) before heavy suffixes, e.g. ruslunā, rusluhum, ruslukum, nuzluhum etc.
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2678; Ibn Muǧāhid, 623).
While it seems that the transmission of ʔabū ʕamr’s reading tradition is sta-
ble enough that we can be reasonably confident that he indeed had the rather
irregular and incomplete system of syncopation that is reported for him, but
in a non-literalist interpretation of the reported fact, we can certainly see how
ʔabū ʕamr and his Meccan teachers Ibn Kaṯīr and Ibn Muḥayṣin clearly retain
the memory of a regular system of syncopation, similar to the one that al-
Farrāʔ describes. This would not lead us to conclude that their readings (or
theirancestralpredecessors)wereentirelycaseless,buttheydopointtoamore
reduced case system, where in some environments u and i dropped out com-
pletely, neutralizing the case contrast between the nominative and the geni-
tive. It is worth noting here as well that when it comes to ʔabū ʕamr’s ʔidġām
kabīr a distinction in treatment between u and i as against a can be observed
as well. When assimilating dissimilar consonants, more phonotactic environ-
ments allow assimilation when u or i intervene than when a intervenes. For
example, a superheavy syllable due to the assimilation of dāl may only hap-
pen if the vowel in between is u or i, e.g. min baʕdi ẓulmīhī →min baʕẓẓul-
mihī (Q5:39) and yurīdu ẓulman →yurīẓẓulman (Q3:108) but no assimilation
in baʕda ẓulmihī (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1169).
That the dropping of the case vowels u and i was considered ideologically
problematic already very early on is quite clear. We have already mentioned al-
Farrāʔ’s opinion that forms without syncope are better, and a central part of
disagreement within ʔabū ʕamr’s transmissions are the many conflicting opin-
ions as to whether he read the words under discussion above ultrashort or with
no vowel at all. This controversy about ʔabū ʕamr’s reading was clearly already
set in motion the generation after his lifetime (he dies 154ah), as Sībawayh (d.
ca. 180ah) already explicitly takes the stance that ʔabū ʕamr did not drop the
vowel in bāriʔĭ-kum, but instead pronounced it ultrashort (Sībawayh, iv, 202).
In conclusion, we can say that there are aspects of ʔabū ʕamr’s reading that

short vowels u and i in when they are suffixed by heavy pronominal clitics.This,

ʕamr, or his teachers that lacked the final short vowels and tanwīn altogether.

7.2.6
Ḥamzah’s ʔidġām kabīr
While ʔabū ʕamr’s major assimilation is clearly part of a regular, but quite likely
artificial, system of reading, making it difficult to see these as traces of a Quran
without final short vowels, this major assimilation also occurs in Ḥamzah’s
reading. In his reading, however, it is not the result of a regularly recurring sys-
tem, but just forms a set of lexical exceptions, which cannot be understood
from the regular linguitic systems of Ḥamzah’s reading (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1194–
1195):
bayyata ṭāʔifah →bayyaṭṭāʔifah (Q4:81)
wa-ṣ-ṣāffāti ṣaffā →wa-ṣ-ṣāffāṣṣaffā (Q37:1)
fa-z-zāǧirāti zaǧrā →fa-z-zāǧirāzzaǧrā (Q37:2)
fa-t-tāliyāti ḏikrā →fat-tāliyāḏḏikrā (Q37:3)
wa-ḏ-ḏāriyāti ḏarwā →wa-ḏ-ḏāriyāḏḏarwā (Q51:1)
Fa-l-mulqiyāti ḏikrā →fa-l-mulqiyāḏḏikrā (Q77:5; only Xallād ʕan
Ḥamzah)
fa-l-muġīrāti ṣubḥā →fa-l-muġīrāṣṣubḥā (Q100:3; only Xallād ʕan
Ḥamzah)
Seemingly equally eligible phrases are not included. For example, fa-s-sābiḥāti
sabḥā, fa-s-sābiqāti sabqā (Q79:3–4) never assimilate.
Especially because it does not seem to be part of a larger system it becomes
tempting to see these as genuine transmissions of forms without case vowels.
But here too, as with ʔabū ʕamr’s reading, this may be a memory not of a case-
less recitation of the Quran, but rather one with a more pervasive assimilation
across word-boundaries.
7.3
A Phonetic Rule That Requires Absence of Full ʔiʕrāb
Throughout the Quranic reading traditions, once occasionally finds forms that,
inprinciplefollowtheclassicalʔiʕrābsystem,butwhosedistributioncannotbe
understood within such a system. An example of this is the inflection of mayyit
‘dead’ in the reading of Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim, Ḥamzah, al-Kisāʔī, and Xalaf. These
readers have the short form of the stem mayt- whenever is occurs as an indef-

inite masculine accusative or in any form of the feminine. The distribution as
formulated for the four Kufans exactly matches the distribution as described
by al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 47) and has been tabulated below:

ʔabū Ǧaʕfar always has the uncontracted form, whereas Yaʕqūb and Nāfiʕ
mostly follow the pattern of the four Kufans mentioned above but Nafīʕ has an
uncontracted form at Q36:33 al-mayyitatu, Q6:122, Q49:12 mayyitan and Q7:57,
Q35:9 mayyitin. Yaʕqūb has Q6:122 mayyitan uncontracted and Ruways ʕan
Yaʕqūb also reports Q49:12 mayyitan. The remaining readers always have the
shortened form (Ibn al-Ǧazarī §2745).
It is difficult to make sense of the Kufan distribution if we assume that full
ʔiʕrāb was present.Why, for example,would the followingshort a in al-maytata
cause shortening of the stem, whereas in al-mayyita it does not? However, if
we take the forms that Van Putten & Stokes (2018) reconstruct as the case
systemof QuranicArabicasthebasis,i.e.asystemidenticaltotheClassicalAra-
bic “pausal” pronunciation, the distribution becomes readily transparent: the
vowel i simply syncopates whenever it stands in an open syllable, an exceed-
ingly common phonological development in the modern Arabic dialects as
well. Only the indefinite accusative -ā and the feminine ending -ah would have
this environment.

just like the one Van Putten & Stokes reconstruct for Quranic Arabic. The fact
that grammarians report this—to them morphological—conditioning with
the Classical Arabic case endings, is a clear example of Grammarians “classiciz-
ing” their dialectal data.The ʔiʕrāb was felt as such a central part of proper Ara-
bic, that all linguistic data gets filtered through that lens, regardless of whether
this is appropriate or not.32
Traces of similar cases of syncope, seemingly triggered by an originally
reduced case system may also be found in the distribution of some of the
CuCuC nouns. For example, for nuḏur ‘warnings’ is universally unsyncopated
among all Quranic readers when it is in the definite form, or in the non-
accusative indefinite. But Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim, ʔabū ʕamr, Ḥamzah, al-Kisāʔī and
Xalaf all syncopate this word in the indefinite accusative nuḏran, while the
rest reads nuḏuran. It is probably no coincidence that the readers that read
in this manner are the same ones that have the mayyit~maytā alternation (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §3694).33 A similar distribution is attested for nukur ‘denial’ which
is read without syncopation in the non-accusative form by all readers but Ibn
Kaṯīr. The indefinite accusative however, is read as the syncopated nukran by a
once again familiar list of readers: Ḥafṣʕan ʕāṣim, Ḥamzah, al-Kisāʔī, Xalaf and
ʔabū ʕamr. In this case also Hišām ʕan Ibn ʕāmir has the syncopated form (Ibn
al-Ǧazarī, §2685).34
7.4
Conclusion
We have argued that two main features that distinguish the Quranic reading
traditions from the language as it is reflected in the qct are the introduction of
32
This is a trend we will continue to see throughout the history of linguistic writings within
the Arabic tradition. For example the famous Himyaritic sentenceرأيك بنحلم كولدك ابنا من
طيب
“I saw in the dream that I gave birth to a son of Gold”, where ‘son’ is conjugated
as ibnan, with the Classical Arabic indefinite accusative, must probably be seen as clas-
sicization of a form of the language which was clearly rather far removed from Hijazi
and Classical Arabic (Rabin 1951, 48). Rabin likewise quotes a few lines of apparent Him-
yaritic poetry, where he quite rightly comments that “there is obviously some admixture
of Classical Arabic”: yā bna Zubayrin ṭāla mā ʕaṣayka; wa-ṭāla ma ʕannaykanā ʔilayka; la-
taḥzananna bi-llaḏī ʔatayka; la-nadṛiban bi sayfina qafayka “Son of Zubair, long hast thou
been disloyal, long hast thou troubled us to come to thee. Thou wilt be grieved for what
thou hast committed (or: what is coming to thee). Yea, with our sword we shall cut off thy
neck.”
33
With the exception that ʔabū ʕamr is included in this distribution.
34
Ibn Kaṯīr also has the syncopated form, but he also syncopates the genitive form nukrin
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2688).

the hamzah and the use of the full Classical Arabic system of final short vowels
and nunation. If my thesis is correct in this regard, this must mean that these
features were consciously introduced into the Quran, and that Quranic Arabic
has been “linguistically reworked” by the early Arab philologists. In the case
of such reworking, one would probably expect to see traces of this process. It
should be clear from the previous and current chapter that these occur in copi-
ous amounts.
There are many examples in the reading traditions where the hamzah was
artificially inserted in places that never etymologically had them, and likewise
there are many more examples of words that inexplicably lack the hamzah,
where for all intents and purposes we would predict that the regular rules of
the treatment of hamzah in these readings would have required them. From
this behaviour we should conclude that the early Arabic philologists did not
always have access to accurate information on the place where the hamzah
should appear, and would make their own (sometimes incorrect) rationalizing
judgments. This is explicitly admitted by the tradition. We have fairly credible
earlyreportsof someof thecanonicalreadersspecificallycommentingontheir
rationalization process in applying the hamzah.
Demonstration of a change in the case system is more complex. The ʔiʕrāb
and tanwīn system being the quintessential feature of Classical Arabic, and
therefore the one feature that binds together all of the reading traditions, it
is of course impossible to recover from these traditions a reading that lacked
this feature altogether. Nevertheless, close examination of the readings does
reveal that here too, we see that the application of ʔiʕrāb and tanwīn was not a
matter of accurate transmission from a prototypical source, but rather a ratio-
nal endeavour. We have a direct citation from the student of al-Kisāʔī of him
citing explicitly aesthetic arguments why he chose to conjugate ṯamūd in a cer-
tain way. Also, a form like ʔayyāna, which quite rightly, is analysed as coming
from ʔayya ʔānin, can only be understood as a hyperclassicism of an input that
lackedcasevowelsaltogether.Thefactthatsomewordsamongthereaderssuch
as mayyit/maytah/maytā seem to undergo syncope conditioned by a case sys-
tem different from the Classical Arabic system—but rather the one that can be
reconstructed for Quranic Arabic, is a clear indication that the case system has
been imposed onto the Quranic language.
Furthermore, thereareagoodnumberof caseswherefinal shortvowels,and
in one case tanwīn, are inexplicably missing. This even seems to be a regular
phenomenon for apocopate/imperative iii-y/w verbs followed by a pronomi-
nal suffix for some readers. Considering the ideological commitment to ʔiʕrāb

forms would have entered the language, if they do not point to some genuine
attempt to retain the proper recitation of such words.
While Vollers was, as Owens (2006, 77, n. 42) put it, “essentially shouted
down […] by his German colleagues” for his views on the language of the
Quran, it is especially his arguments for this reworking which I believe have
not been given the adequate evaluation that they deserved. Vollers’ arguments
for a wholesale transition from an Ur-Quran without case to the fully Classical
case inflection were indeed rather weak,35 but one thing he does conclusively
show is that the readers of the Quran clearly reworked the readings according
togrammaticalandphilologicalprinciples.AsVollersdidnotrelyonverydirect
sourcesonthereadingtraditions,36hemissedmanycasesof suchartificialityin
the readings that I have shown in chapter 3, 6 and the current chapter, but nev-
ertheless on many occasions noticed clear cases of pseudocorrection among
both canonical and non-canonical readers (such as the canonical reading of
saʔqay-hā for sāqay-hā).
Nöldeke (1910, 1f.) criticized Vollers for not realizing that many of the read-
ings cited as evidence for philological reworking of the Quran are canonical.37
But these readings being accepted as canonical does not alleviate the prob-
lem that Vollers highlights. Nöldeke admits that the recitation of the Quran
was linguistically reworked, but believes that under the layers of artifice a true
language always shines through (Nöldeke 1910, 2). But how can we be so certain
that it is the “true language” that shines through? What philological evidence
based on primary source material of the Quran has been adduced? Nöldeke,
nor any of Vollers’ other critics ever adequately address this crucial point. Why
would this one central feature—one so laden with ideological commitment as
the ʔiʕrāb system—be the one system that the readings accurately reflect while
so many other features carry “artificial decorations”?
35
Although these arguments have only been seldomly adequately addressed by his critics.
See Van Putten & Stokes (2018, 145f.) for a discussion.
36
He primarily relied on reports found in the ʔanwār al-Tanzīl wa-ʔasrār al-Taʔwīl by the
very late scholar Nāṣir al-Dīn al-Bayḍāwī (d. 685ah) for his information on the Qirāʔāt.
37
This was a misrepresentation of Vollers’ understanding of the situation, e.g. Vollers (1906,
25) explicitly speaks of “al Kisâʾi († um 180), einer der kanonischen Qorânleser”, clearly
showing awareness of this distinction. While it is an unfair criticism of Vollers, it would
in fact have been a perfectly reasonable criticism of several scholars who would later give
his work short shrift, such as Wehr (1952) and Zwettler (1978). Both authors seem to be
almost entirely unaware of the existence of any linguistic differences of the Quranic read-
ing traditions and what effect this may have for our understanding of what the ʕarabiyyah
is.

chapter 7
As it is clear that all the canonical Quranic readings (and as far as we can
see, also the non-canonical ones) have been linguistically reworked, we must
becarefultogeneralizefromthesesourcestomakeanypronouncementsabout
the original language of the Quranic composition. Of course, that is not to say
that the reading traditions are devoid of interest to the researcher who wishes
to reconstruct the language of the qct, and indeed its original composition.
The linguistic variation found in the reading tradition is a massive font of lin-
guistic data that allows us to gain insight into the kinds of linguistic variation
that existed in the literary language of the early Islamic period. The transmis-
sions of this data frequently predate the activity of our earliest grammarian
authors, and record wider linguistic variation. These allow the researcher to
quickly generate a number of different hypothetical pronunciations, which
may then be checked against the qct. An example where the reading tradi-
tions clearly retain the original linguistic situation as reflected in the qct can
be found with the preservation of a word-final ā/ē contrast as preserved in
the readings of al-Kisāʔī, Ḥamzah, Xalaf and Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ, which rhyme and
orthography of the qct clearly show are an accurate reflection of the system
as found in Quranic Arabic.
If it is the case that all of the Quranic readings, canonical or otherwise, have
been linguistically reworked, how can we be certain that any part of these read-
ings is in any way a reflection of the actual language as intended by the qct, or
indeed of its original composition? This question simply cannot be answered,
as it traditionally has been, through the sole examination of the Arabic liter-
ary tradition. I hope that this work has shown that the tradition is too late, too
artificial, too contradictory and too ideologically invested in the ideal of the
ʕarabiyyah to function as the sole reliable source on the language of the Quran.
For this reason, we must turn to the actual primary source material that is by
far the closest to the time of composition of the text: the Quranic Consonantal
Text itself.

chapter 8
From Hijazi beginnings to Classical Arabic
abū ḥayyān, Baḥr al-Muḥīṭ
∵
The previous chapters have been concerned with four general topics. The first
of these asked the question what the ʕarabiyyah was according to the earliest
grammarians—demonstrating that these early grammarians had a much less
prescriptive view of the language than what we later come to define as Clas-
sical Arabic. This is cause for us to rethink what it means for the language of
the Quran to be the ʕarabiyyah, and forces us to ask a more precise question:
what was the language of the Quran really like, which of the myriad competing
features of the ʕarabiyyah were the ones that were proper to the language of
the Quran, if any?
Turning to the Quranic reading traditions, we find that far from giving a uni-
form answer as to the linguistic features of Quranic Arabic are, they frequently
employ many different forms reported by the grammarians. This shows that
in this period the concept of what the ʕarabiyyah was and was not, was still
very much under debate. Moreover, it was shown that the linguistic systemthat
the Quranic reading traditions reflect do not seem to form consistent linguistic
systems that agree very well with the Arabic dialects as described by the gram-
marians. Moreover, they frequently go beyond what falls under the purview of
the grammarians, incorporating linguistic features that must be thought of as
artificial. Because of the great amount of disagreement between the readings,
as well as their artificial nature, the Quranic readings cannot be seen as giving
a clear and undeniable insight into what the language of the Quran truly was
at the time of its composition.
Subsequently, I proposed that we do away with the mixed signals that come
in through the Quranic reading traditions, and instead focus on the linguis-
tic features that can be deduced from the one part of the Quranic corpus that
clearly stems from the early Islamic period, namely the Quranic Consonan-
tal text of the Uthmanic Archetype. Once we look at the features that can be

deduced from this earliest stratum of the Quran, a surprisingly consistent pic-
tureemerges:Nearlyallisoglossesthatcanbededucedfromtheqct,alignwith
Hijazi Arabic.
The fact that such a consistent picture emerges from the study of the qct is
not at all obvious from the perspective of the tradition. The Arabic philological
tradition was not troubled by features in the Quran being mixed and matched
fromavarietyof differentdialects,andtherewasnofocusonarguingthatwhat-
ever occurred in the Quran had to be Hijazi Arabic. The fact that, despite this,
such a clear picture presents itself suggests both that we should take the qct as
a linguistic source seriously, as well as conclude that the language of the Quran
has been reworked and ‘Classicized’ over time, to yield the much more Classi-
cal looking forms of Arabic in which the text is recited today. In the previous
chapters, I have demonstrated that there is in fact quite a lot of evidence in the
way the readings behave as well as in the literary sources that this is indeed
what happened: the readers were actively aiming to make the language of the
Quranmoreinlinewithwhattheyconsideredtobetheproperʕarabiyyah.This
can be clearly seen from the fact that readers were concerned with questions of
pseudocorrect application of the hamzah—a feature said to be absent in the
language of the Hijaz. But also, perhaps more controversial, I suggest we can
see traces of the Classical Arabic case system having been imposed onto the
original language as reflected in the qct, which had lost most of its word final
short vowels and tanwīn.
The title of this book is “Quranic Arabic: from its Hijazi Beginnings to its
Classical Arabic readings.” Having arrived at the end of this work, it seems
worthwhile to provide here a chronological reconstruction of the development
of the language of the Quran up until the language of the reading traditions as
we see it today, and finally, place the emergence of a standard Classical Arabic
within this framework.
8.1
The Prophet’s Career
We do not have a perfect direct source of the composition of the Quran as it
was recited by the prophet Muhammad during his career. Nevertheless, con-
sidering that the Quran is a rhyming text, and the qct normally agrees with
the phonetics that seem to be reflected in the rhyme, it seems fairly safe to say
that the language of the qct was close to the language Muhammad would have
used during his career as a prophet in the early seventh century. The language
of composition would not have been Classical Arabic, but instead the local ver-
nacular of Mecca and/or Medinah: Hijazi Arabic—luġat ʔahl al-Ḥiǧāz.

Although the Quranic verses that affirm that the Quran itself and its lan-
guage are ʕarabiyy have sometimes been interpreted as the Quran affirming
that it is composed in Classical Arabic—or at least a high language distinct
from the vernacular, I believe that Al-Jallad’s (2020b) analysis of the ʕarabiyy
verses is much more probable. He suggests that these verses are specifically
meant to affirm that the Quran was revealed in the local vernacular in contrast
to the scriptures of, for example, the Jews and Christians which would have
been ʔaʕǧamiyy ‘foreign, unintelligible’ which is especially clear in Q16:103,
where this conflict between ʕarabiyy and ʔaʕǧamiyy is highlighted:ولقد نعلم
انهم يقولون انما يعلمه بشر لسان الذذى يلحدون اليه اعجمي وهذا لسان عربى مبين
/wa-laqad
naʕlam annahum yaqūlūn innamā yuʕallimu-h bašar; lisānu llaḏī yulḥidūn
ilayh aʕǧamī wa-hāḏā lisān ʕarabī mubīn/ “We have certainly learned that they
say that it is just a human that is teaching him; but the language which they
refer to is foreign, while this is the clear Arabic tongue.”
The dichotomy between Classical Arabic and the “vernacular” should not be
seen in such stark terms as it often is within the field. Just because the Quran
is composed in the local vernacular does not mean it cannot have retained
many of the highly archaic features that we associate today with Classical Ara-
bic, rather than the modern vernaculars. The idea that the “vernacular” nature
of the language needs to imply the loss of these archaic features—leading to
an rapprochement to the modern vernaculars—is unwarranted, but a view
that appears frequently in the literature (e.g. Blau 1977; Zwettler 1978). What-
ever vernacular was spoken in the Hijaz in the early seventh century would,
of course, quite likely be much more archaic in many regards than those spo-
ken more than a millennium later. Vollers’ (1906) theory posited that the Hijazi
vernacular was very close to the widespread modern vernaculars such as the
Egypto-Levantine dialect bundle, having lost case distinctions in all environ-
ments. The evidence does not support such a conclusion.
8.2
The Uthmanic Recension (ca. 30ah/650ce)
While the details of the when and by whom of the canonization of the Uth-
manic text type have been debated for some time, a new focus on the use of
primary source material in the form of early Islamic manuscripts has made
it quite clear that this canonization was most likely undertaken during the
reign of the third caliph ʕuṯmān b. ʕaffān, who had four copies made that
were distributed to Kufa, Basra, Syria (likely Homs, see Sidky 2021, 171–174)
and Medina. The orthography of this archetype has been extraordinarily well-
preserved and quite clearly reflects the Hijazi dialect—something universally

acknowledged, even by scholars who did not conclude from this that the lan-
guage it intended to represent was also Hijazi.
The clear agreement between the orthography and the Quranic rhyme
shows that the language of the Uthmanic recension was certainly not very far
removed from the language of the original composition. Likewise, the ortho-
graphicalandlinguisticfeaturesasfoundintheUthmanicrecensionshowclear
and obvious connections to the administrative language of the early Arabic
papyri.
The various reports that the Quran was revealed in the language of the
Qurayš and that ʕuṯmān explicitly ordered the Quran to be written in the lan-
guage of the Qurayš should, in light of the discoveries presented in this work,
be reevaluated. Kahle brings one such a report, quoted by al-Farrāʔ:1
ʿUmar b. al-Khaṭṭāb heard a man reading ʿattā ḥina (sic) in the meaning
of ḥattā ḥīna. He said: ‘Who taught you to recite thus?’ He said: ‘ʿAbdallāh
b. Masʿūd.’ So, he wrote to ʿAbdallāh b. Masʿūd: ‘The Koran came down in
the language of the Ḳuraish and it came not down in the language of the
Hudhail. So, do you teach men to recite it in the language of the Ḳuraish
and not in language of the Hudhail.’
Zwettler, and with him Rabin do not accept that the Quran was composed
in the language of the Qurayš, and instead believe the Quran was composed
in the ‘poetic koiné’. Zwettler reads part of the section that Kahle translates
from al-Farrāʔ, as evidencefor this.Al-Farrāʔargues that theQurayšdialectwas
superior to all others, and interestingly cites a couple of reasons, pointing out it
lackstheʕanʕanahof theTamīm(pronouncingʕaynasʔalif ),northe Kaskasah
1 While the attribution of this discussion to al-Farrāʔ is certainly how it appears in the manu-
script cbl ms. Arab. 705, a work on Quranic verse counts falsely attributed to al-Farrāʔ, one
has to wonder about the accuracy of this attribution. Larcher (2005, 802f.) speculates that
the text is an extract from al-Farrāʔ’s Luġāt al-Qurʔān, but since Larcher’s writing, that text
has now become available to us. If it was ever part of that text, it has not come down in the
recension we have access to today. There are some reasons to doubt the attribution of the
citation to al-Farrāʔ: it does not seem to be quoted in any other known works even though
al-Farrāʔ gets cited so frequently in a large variety of medieval works, that a large portion of
Luġāt al-Qurʔān and al-Maʕānī could be reconstructed from citations alone (and for Luġāt
al-Qurʔān, Rabin at times indeed does, see the discussion on hollow root ʔimālah in §5.9). It
would be quite surprising for an account as interesting for linguistic ideologies as this one to
not be cited at all in works perhaps more relevant to linguistic questions than a book on verse
counts. I will proceed on the assumption that the quote indeed comes from al-Farrāʔ, though
the identity of the author of the quote does not significantly impact our conclusions here.

of Rabīʕah (pronouncing the pausal 2sg.f. ending -ki as -kis2) nor the kasr of the
Qays in tiʕlamūna, tiʕlam (Barth-Ginsberg alternation) and biʕir, šiʕir (for baʕir
and šaʕir, see §2.2.3).
It is an anachronism to think that these features, absent in the modern stan-
dard of Classical Arabic, where absent in the poetic koiné/ʕarabiyyah, as they
are described in detail by Sībawayh and other early grammarians. It would,
moreover, be a mistake to take this discussion of al-Farrāʔ to equate the most
eloquent form of the ʕarabiyyah—the one that later becomes to standard Clas-
sical Arabic—with the dialect of the Qurayš. In fact, when we examine al-
Farrāʔ’s writing in a broader perspective including his Luġāt al-Qurʔān and
Maʕānī al-Qurʔān, he clearly has no issue assigning linguistic features to the
Qurayš that he almost certainly did not employ himself in Quranic recitation.
For example, he reports that the Qurayš did not apply vowel harmony to of
the third person pronouns -hū, -humā, -hum and -hunna (al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 10f.),
that they did not have the front rounded vowel for passive hollow verbs qǖla
(al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 14), but rather qīla and that they read mustahziʔūna with-
out hamzah as mustahzūna (al-Farrāʔ Luġāt, 15). His teacher, al-Kisāʔī, recites
the Quran with the non-Qurašī option in all three of those cases. The other
Kufan reciters have the Qurašī option for qīla, but for the other options are
non-Qurašī. Al-Farrāʔ is a transmitter of al-Kisāʔī’s reading and clearly sees
no problem in terms of eloquence of reading in such a manner, as he does
not explicitly denounce any of these manners of readings, not in his Luġāt al-
Qurʔān, nor in his Maʕānī al-Qurʔān.
Clearly, to al-Farrāʔ, there was no inherent contradiction between the state-
ment that the Quran was revealed in the dialect of the Qurayš, and the Quran
being recited in something that was self-evidently to al-Farrāʔ not the language
of theQurayš.3Thisdoesnotprovethatthelanguageof theQuranwasClassical
Arabic/poetic koiné, as Zwettler would have it. It proves that the original lan-
guageof recitationwasnotrelevanttohowtheQuranwasrecited.Thismakesit
significantly more plausible that the traces of Classicization of the language of
the Quran that we see were considered acceptable to this late second century
ah authority.
2 This is sometimes understood as referring to a palatalization of pausal -k to -ts. I find the evi-
dence for this not particularly compelling, and will stick to the literal reading here.
3 On the apparent contradiction between Qurayš being the most eloquent of languages, and at
the same time the most eloquent language, the ʕarabiyyah, being nothing like the language
of the Qurayš see the excellent discussion by Larcher on this text by al-Farrāʔ in relation to a
similar text by Ibn Fāris (Larcher 2005).

chapter 8
Clearly, not all grammarians were equally satisfied with this dialectal iden-
tification of the Quran’s language. In the interpretation of the sabʕat ʔaḥruf
ḥadīṯ, ʔabū ʕubayd al-Qāsim b. Sallām (d. 224ah/838ce) reports that the much
debated ʔaḥruf refer to seven different dialects of Arabic, Ibn al-Ǧazarī (§65)
quotes ʔabū ʕubayd as claiming these seven dialects were: Qurayš, Huḏayl,4
Taym al-Rabāb, al-ʔazd, Rabīʕah, Hawazān and Saʕd b. Bakr, but no such spe-
cific reference is given in ʔabū ʕubayd’s Faḍāʔil al-Qurʔān, where he does men-
tion that the Quran was revealed in seven dialects (attributing this claim to
the companion Ibn ʕabbās), without specifying which seven those were (ʔabū
ʕubayd Faḍāʔil al-Qurʔān, 340).
Regardless of the historicity of al-Farrāʔ’s report, we can conclude that what-
ever language the Quran was composed in, the Quranic reading traditions are
not only linguistically clearly not a guide to what that language of the Quran
was (as I have argued in chapter 3), but also that these early influential author-
ities seem to agree with that conclusion.
While the above report, cited by al-Farrāʔ without ʔisnād, may very well be
late, there is another well-attested bundle of reports about the process of the
Uthmanic recension, which seems to have been extraordinarily early, Motzki
(2001) through his detailed isnad-cum-matn analysis shows that the common
link of this report is Ibn Šihāb al-Zuhrī (d. 124ah/741–742ce). This report usu-
ally includes the mention that ʕuṯmān’s recension of the Quran should be
written in the dialect of the Qurayš because it was revealed in their language,
and that part of the report independently goes back to our common link Ibn
Šihāb.5
Thus,throughʔibrāhīmb.SaʕdandŠuʕayb6bothontheauthorityof al-Zuhrī
we get a virtually identical report:

4 Note that this is in direct conflict with the report of ʕumar cited by al-Farrāʔ.
5 The version reported by al-Ṭabarī lacks this section (Comerro 2012, 37). The partial common
link of al-Ṭabarī’s version is Yūnus, transmitting from the common link Ibn Šihāb al-Zuhrī
(Motzki 2001, 25).
6 The partial common link of Šuʕayb’s version forms a partial common link one generation
later, at ʔabū l-Yamān (Motzki 2001, 25).

Schwally (Nöldeke et al. 2013, 260) dismissed the historicity of this part of the
report as an outright forgery, saying: “generally, any tradition connecting the
ʿUthmānic text in any way with dialectal questions must be rejected, since the
Koranisnotwritteninalocaldialectatallbutratherhasalanguageidenticalto
that of the pre-Islamic poems.”While this has been the communisopinio before
him and after him, I hope that the current work has shown that the identity of
the Quranic language with poetry has so far only been asserted and has not
been demonstrated, and that the qct indeed quite clearly reflects Hijazi Ara-
bic. Considering the earliness of the report and how well it aligns with the facts
of the early Quranic manuscripts, we can carefully conclude that this report
may very well retain a historical memory of the original language of composi-
tion of the Quran.
8.3
The Era of the Readers (ca. 40ah–250ah)
While the original language of the Quran, as shown by the qct and affirmed
by the tradition appears to have been Hijazi Arabic (or specifically Qurashi),
at some point linguistic norms—at least in the recitation of the Quran—shift
drastically, giving rise to the classicized reading traditions that we know among
the canonical, and non-canonical readers alike.

chapter 8
Al-Jallad (2020b, 69f.) draws a tentative initial history of this development.
He suggests that Old Hijazi, the language of the qct, was the literary and pres-
tige dialect of the Medinan state, and continued to be so as it transitioned into
the early Umayyad empire. He suggests that in the Umayyad period another lit-
erary form of Arabic gains prestige, namely the language of the Qaṣīdah, with
its strict metered and rhymed system. While the exact linguistic features of
these odes are obscured by the inexorable forces of revision towards the later
literary standard,12 one feature is undeniable: the system of final short vowels
and tanwīn forms an integral part of its structure confirmed by the rhyme and
metre.
It seems possible that this new literary standard that enters into the soci-
olinguistic arena, vying for prestige should be identified as the dialect of the
Maʕadd. Al-Jallad follows Peter Webb’s highly thought-provoking observation
that the main label of group identity in the pre-Islamic qaṣīdahs is Maʕadd
(Webb2017,70ff.),whotheseMaʕaddwereandhowtheirqaṣīdahsgainedpres-
tige in the Umayyad period is a question that we hope Al-Jallad will address in
the future research project he mentions in his book (Al-Jallad 2020b, 69).
However we interpret this relation to Maʕadd exactly, one thing is abun-
dantly clear and I follow Al-Jallad completely in his conclusion: “the Qaṣīdah
belong to a different literary culture than that of the Ḥigāz, as its form is not
found in the Quran. And even though the Quran refers to poets, there [is] noth-
ing to suggest that these poets were producing poems belonging to the same
style as the pre-Islamic Qaṣīdah.” In a footnote he adds: “the very fact that the
Quran had to tell its audience that the speaker was not a “poet” suggests a struc-
tural similarity between the text and what the audience would have considered
poetry. If the Classical Qaṣīdah was the prototype, no such warning would have
been necessary.”
When exactly this literary variety starts to play a central role in influencing
Arabic literary prose is frustratingly difficult to answer, due to the dearth of pri-
mary source material that dates from the period and is likewise vocalized, but
when it comes to the period that this “qaṣīdah register” starts playing a role in
Quranicrecitationputsusonfirmerground.Thetransmissionof manyQuranic
readers is rather strong, and there can be little doubt that the form in which
they have been transmitted to us is very close to how they actually recited the
Quran.
The earliest reader by far would certainly be Ibn ʕāmir, who is said to have
lived from 8 to 118ah, but his transmission is problematic for a variety of rea-

granting that, his transmission has only come down to us through one trans-

tions fromYaḥyā sharing, partially, the same teachers. So, this reading may have
taken its Classical shape as late as the mid second century ah.
al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī (110ah) and Ibn Muḥayṣin al-Makkī (d. 123ah) along with
the canonical reader Ibn Kaṯīr (d. 122ah) (see al-Ḏahabī 46, 69, 89) make up
the next group of earliest readers, and their readings can be more securely
attributed to their lifetimes. Therefore, somewhere in their lifetimes this reg-
ister formerly proper to the pre-Islamic Qaṣīdah had gained enough prestige to
come to be accepted as part of the prestigious Quranic recitation.
The bulk of the canonical and well-attested non-canonical readers alike,
have their death dates all throughout the middle of the second until the mid-

the hamzah) rose to dominance in this period. At its earliest, at the start of the
Umayyad period, but probably became firmly established some decades after
the beginning of the Umayyad period (perhaps around 80ah).
This seems to be independently confirmed by the primary source material
in the form of early Quranic manuscripts. The earliest manuscripts, those that
can be dated to the seventh century, lack any form of vocalization signs and
purely reflect the standard Uthmanic text, a consonantal skeleton (e.g. cpp,

By the 8th century a system of red dots developed to write the vowel signs.
Of course, the absence of vowel signs does not necessarily suggest that in this
period the Quran was still recited in a purely Hijazi manner, but it stands to
reason to consider the development of the vowel signs to suit a need, and this
need would have quite naturally been to aid recitation in the linguistic style of
the now popular Qaṣīdahs.
The fact that vocalization in manuscripts is primarily focused not on mark-
ingthewordinternalvowels—thatpartwasclearlyconsideredquiteuncontro-
versial—but to primarily mark (1) word final short vowels and tanwīn and (2)
The place of the hamzah, is a strong indication that it was specifically these
two features that were salient and of prime importance to be conveyed in this
period of developing reading traditions.
For an illustration of this system I have transcribed below a single page of
R 119, f. 23a (for the photo see Déroche (2014), fig. 17). Every section in bold is
expressed in the vocalization. Of the 112 cases of vocalization, only 23 are used
to mark word-internal vowels, the remaining 89 express stem-final short vow-
els, ʔiʕrāb/tanwīn, or hamzah.

Of course, it is frequently very difficult to be establish whether the red dot-
ting is in fact contemporary with the writing of the text, and we only become
more certain of this when we reach manuscripts of the classical Kufic b.ii and
d styles, which generally date to around the middle to end of the third cen-
tury ah (Déroche 1992, 36f.), where the vocalization appears in virtually all
manuscripts in these styles, clearly indicating that they were considered an
integral part of the manuscript’s creation.
Addition of vocalization is certainly unlikely to post-date the third century,
as by the early fourth century Ibn Muǧāhid canonizes the seven canonical
readers, after which these rapidly become the dominant readings reflected in
manuscripts. Before this canonization, however, more often than not the read-
ings represented in these manuscripts are clearly non-canonical, and unlikely
to have been added to such manuscripts in, say, the fourth century ah or
later.
Severalmanuscriptsshownascentformsof thevocalizationsystem,express-
ing hamzah in ways that are somewhat different from later manuscripts. Most
prominent is Kairouan, Musée des arts islamiques R 38, a manuscript which
from its ornamentation and script style should clearly be considered part of
the imperial Umayyad Qurans, which uses not red dots but red dashes, and
seem to predate the innovation of doubling the vowel sign to mark tanwīn, as
it uses only a single dot where one expects two to be written. It stands to rea-
son to consider this a very early example of this system, and may very well be
contemporaneous to this manuscript, which likewise follows a non-canonical
reading.

leaves that unharmonized as bihū. These features likewise give it the impres-
sion of being rather more archaic than the regular vocalization style.

to express word-internal short vowels. I believe that we can place the rise of
the vocalized manuscript, and especially the one with a focus on the final
short vowels and hamzah, in the Umayyad period, continuing into the Abbasid
period, contemporaneous with the rise of activity of Quranic readers.
It is of course also quite significant that the eponymous readers to which
all these readings are attributed come from this crucial era in the early 8th to
9th century. It would have been extraordinarily attractive to attribute the read-
ings not to historically rather insignificant figures like the eponymous readers,
but rather to companions of the prophet or the prophet himself, but this does
not happen. This is because it is precisely these readers that constructed these
classicized readings in this era.
A final, but much more scanty piece of evidence for the shift from a clas-
sicization of the Quran may perhaps be found in the grammatical terminol-
ogy as it is used by the early exegetical works as studied by Versteegh (1993).
A striking difference between the very earliest transmitted tafsīr of Muǧāhid
b. Ǧabr (d. 104/722) compared to some of the slightly later exegetes such as
Muḥammad b. al-Sāʔib al-Kalbī (d. 146/763), Muqātil b. Sulaymān (d. 150/767)
and Sufyān al-Ṯawrī (d. 161/778) is exactly the complete absence of the for-
mer of any terminology for ʔiʕrāb and tanwīn, and even in Sufyān al-Ṯawrī’s
commentary such terminology is almost entirely absent, he only uses the verb
nawwana “to apply nunation” once (Versteegh 1993, 113). This is quite different
from Muḥammad al-Kalbī who shows a concern for variant readings and in dis-
cussing them displays a full set of terms for final short vowels (Versteegh 1993,
125ff.). It is difficult not to notice that Muḥammad al-Kalbī’s is exactly the gen-
eration of many of the great Quranic reciters such as ʔabū ʕamr (d. 154/770)
and ʕāṣim (d. 127/745) and Nāfiʕ (d. 169/785), while Muǧāhid clearly precedes
them, and thus perhaps also the widespread classicization of the language of
the Quran.
This era marked an explosion of different linguistic forms, and a negotiation
of what the linguistic features of the ʕarabiyyah were going to be. This much
is already clear from the disagreement on the linguistic details between the
canonical readers (as we saw in chapter 3), but also other non-canonical read-
ers show an even broader amount of linguistic variation than is allowed within
the canonical ten. Also, within the vocalized Quranic manuscripts, a wealth of
different forms and unusual recombinations of features are found.14 What the
ʕarabiyyah was, was not yet straightforward, and this period must be seen as

a negotiation towards a new standard, truly only one central feature remains
constant throughout this experimentation and that is that the final short vow-
els and tanwīn, the one feature that is perpetuated by every line of the new
central literary form: the qaṣīdah.
8.4
Crystallization of Classical Arabic (ca. 250–350ah)
There is a reason why we speak of Classical Arabic in a much more restricted
sense than the ʕarabiyyah that the early grammarians sought to describe.
Indeed, at some point, the negotiation of what the ʕarabiyyah starts to crys-
tallize and a fairly uniform system emerges which is more or less identical
to grammar books such as Fischer, Wright and Thackston. When exactly this
complete crystallization takes place, is as of yet, not entirely clear. Research
into the linguistic norms of non-Quranic literary manuscripts of the third and
fourth centuries is still a desideratum. But I will provide some initial observa-
tions.
The papyrus copy of al-Ǧāmiʕ by Ibn Wahb (d. 197ah), copied in 275ah/
889ce and published by David-Weill (1939) is remarkable for being strikingly
unclassical in its language.Despitebeing unvocalized,it has manyfeaturesthat
would not be considered part of the Classical Arabic language that we know
today. Middle Arabists such as Blau (1999, Appendix i) have often taken this
work to be a reflection of ‘Middle Arabic’, a form of Arabic that mixes Classi-
cal Arabic and colloquial features. However, if Blau is right to suppose that the
unusual linguistic features present in this manuscript are rather reflective of
the peculiarities of Ibn Wahb’s Arabic rather than of its copyist, we are deal-
ing with a manuscript stemming right from the period that the parameters of
the literary language were still being negotiated. Regardless of whether some
of the unusual features of Ibn Wahb’s text as the result of interference of the
author’s colloquial Arabic, seeing his deviations from Classical Arabic as devi-
ations from an established standard is anachronistic. For example, it is highly
problematictodeclareformslikeاربعةا]عشر[ʔarbaʕ(a)taʕšar asanon-Classical
form (Blau 1999, 124), while ʔabū Ǧaʕfar (d. 130ah) who recites Q74:30تسعه عشر
as tisʕataʕšar (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3205) which would make it ʕarabiyyah by defini-
tion. Clearly, the jury was still out on whether such a form was to become part
of Classical Arabic.
The copy of ʔabū ʕubayd al-Qāsim b. Sallām’s (d. 224ah) Ġarīb al-Ḥadīṯ,
copied in 252ah, and with that the oldest known dated paper manuscript in
Arabic, held at the Leiden University Library under the shelf mark Or. 298 is
another data point worthy of examination. This manuscript is vocalized with

the modern vowel signs that are clearly contemporary with the main text, and
this gives us an insight into some of the linguistic features. Many of the fea-
tures that we associate with standard Classical Arabic are present, even though
the orthography is exceptionally archaic, thus ʔuxrā-hā and ʔūlā-hā are spelled
with typically Quranic orthographic practice of using yāʔ for the ʔalif maq-
ṣūrahevenbeforeapronominalclitic:اهيَرخُ اandاهيَ لوُ ا
(LeidenUniversityLibrary,
Or. 298,15 2r, l. 13). But despite this spelling, which has sometimes been inter-
preted as indicating ʔimālah, the spelling with fatḥah before this ʔalif maq-
ṣūrah suggests that it already employed the standard Classical Arabic -ā. Like-
wise, the plural pronouns are short, and they undergo vowel harmony, and the
appearance of hamzah appears to be quite conservative.
But a question is, to what extent these features that are present in the
manuscript are indicative of a crystallization of the Classical norms. We are
lucky enough to have a transmission of ʔabū ʕubayd’s own reading of the
Quran, and for each of these features he indeed follows the Classical norm.
Yet there are indications that not all users of the literary Arabic language in
the early third century would stick perfectly to this Classical Arabic norm. For
example, in his Quranic recitation, ʔabū Ḥātim al-Siǧistānī (d. 255ah) still has
thenon-standardClassicalArabiclackof vowelharmonyafter-ayfortheplural
pronoun, i.e. ʕalayhum but fīhim, bihim (van Putten and Sidky forthcoming).
Whether ʔabū Ḥātim would have employed such pronominal behaviour out-
sideof hisreadingtraditionandinhisClassicalArabicprose,issadlysomething
that cannot be confirmed, as we lack any autographs, or in fact any copies at all
of his works, but I see little reason assume a difference between recitation and
Classical Arabic prose a priori.
What is definitely clear is that about a century later, in Ibn Xālawayh’s Kitāb
al-Badīʕ, of which we have a copy from his death year (380ah, cbl Ar 3051),
all the features part of the standard Classical Arabic have been firmly estab-
lished.16 This is independently confirmed by the literary tradition, the con-
temporary author Ibn Mihrān (d. 381ah) in his description of the pronominal
system of the Quranic readers, strikingly different from most other sources in
the genre, only mentions deviations from the Classical norm, leaving it implicit
that anyonewhomhedoesnot mentionexplicitly,simplyhastheClassicalAra-
bic harmonizing short suffixes (see van Putten and Sidky forthcoming).

Although occasional surprising variants show up, still from a normative perspective, for
example the plural proximal deictic hāʔulāʔi is spelledهَوْلآimplying hawlāʔi (5r., l. 3), a
variant recognized to exist by Al-Farrāʔ (lughāt, 22), but not generally considered part of

from hijazi beginnings to classical arabic
229
It seems then that quite soon after (if not already during) the period I
labelled ‘the Era of the Readers’ the typical features that we now associate
with standard Classical Arabic became firmly established. Some of the typical
features that became fixed, which at the time of the early readers and gram-
marians were clearly still up for debate are:
– Harmonization of -hū and -hum (and vowel length disharmony of -hū/-hu,
-hī/-hi), a feature generally associated with the Najdi dialects.
– Short plural pronouns, rather than the long forms -humū, ʾantumū etc.
– Conservative syllable structure, typical for the Hijazi dialects (rusul and
kalimah, not rusl and kalmah, kilmah).
– Conservative retention of the hamzah, typical of Najdi dialects.
– Generalization of the a-vowel in prefix conjugation typical of the Hijaz,
rather than the Najdi forms like tiʕlamu.
– Absence of i-umlaut ʔimālah, a feature associated with Najd.
– Completelossof thefourthphonemicvowelē foriii-ynounsandverbs,con-
sidered to be a Najdi feature by the grammarians, but clearly also part of
Quranic Arabic originally.
Thisratherchaoticcombinationof featuresof standardClassicalArabicshould
make it quite clear that the rather popular notion that Classical Arabic is pri-
marily influenced by the Najdi dialects is not really borne out by the evidence.
While the vowel harmony of the pronouns and the conservative use of the
hamzah are indeed striking features associated with Najd, many other features
typical of Najd like the far-reaching syncope of i and u in open syllables, the
front vowel prefixes in the verb and ʔimālah are entirely absent.
Moreover, much of the morphology that is reflected by the actual conso-
nantal skeleton, such as the shape of the deictic pronouns is almost invariably
in agreement with the Hijazi forms, while the Najdi ḏāka occurs occasionally
in Classical Arabic prose, ḏālika far outnumbers it, and tīka/ḏīka, hāḏī and
(hā-)ʔulā instead of tilka, hāḏihī and hāʔulāʔi are almost entirely unheard of.
Contrary to popular belief, I would therefore also say that it is in fact Hijazi Ara-
bic that is the main contributor to the phonology and morphology of Classical
Arabic rather than Najdi Arabic.This is, no doubt, due to the massive influence
the Quran had on the emerging literary tradition of Arabic. That this influence
has not been realized sooner, primarily seems to rest on the fact that whenever
the Quran agreed with standard Classical Arabic it has been considered to be
normal and unremarkable and in line with the conclusion that the Quran was
composed in standard Classical Arabic.
Despite a crystallization of most of the main Classical Arabic norms being
complete around the 4th century ah, it remains possible to encounter non-
textbook features occur in perfectly Classical Arabic prose until surprisingly

late. While certainly outside the scope of the current book, let me highlight a
few salient cases that I have noticed.
Syncopation of huwa and hiya after wa-, fa-, la- to wa-hwa, fa-hya (§2.2.4.3)
sticks around in Classical Arabic prose until surprisingly late. For example,
al-Maǧmūʕ al-Rašīdiyyah (BnF Arabe 2324) dated to 710ah regularly has this
syncope throughout its text (see 3r, l. 12; 10r, l. 10; 22r, l. 3; 34v, l. 16; 40v, l. 6; 50v,
l. 6, etc.), it also attested the Hijazi form of ‘to see’ rāʔa-hū (§5.11) rather than
the textbook form raʔā-hu (5v, l. 8). Even later, in a copy of Risālat ibn ʔabī Zayd
from 1059ah we find evidence of an-nubūʔah ‘prophecy’ instead of the text-
book an-nubuwwah (BnF Arabe 1058, 5v, l. 8), a form often considered to be a
“hyperclassicism” (§6.5.1.1). Also, the dropping of hamzah in places where the
textbook norms do not prescribe it is attested surprisingly late, e.g. mašiyyatu-
ka for mašīʔatuka in a copy of al-Ǧazūlī’s Dalāʔil al-Xayrāt from 1170ah (BnF
Arabe 6859, 36r, l. 10).
8.5
Conclusion
I hope that this work has shown that there is still much to be discovered about
the Quranic Arabic language, and that both Quranic Arabic, the reading tradi-
tions of the Quran and the emergence of the standard Classical Arabic deserve
to be studied in their own right. I hope to have shown that the way we think
about the language of the Quran needs to be approached from a (historical)
linguistic point of view, and should be reframed not from a position where we
anachronistically impose later standards onto the text, but starting from its pri-
mary source material: the Quranic Consonantal Text.
Undoubtedly much more is to be discovered. There are two main topics I
wish to highlight here. First is the corpus of early Islamic papyri and inscrip-
tions. These share many linguistic similarities with the language of the Quran,
andshouldlikewisebeseenasproductsof theirtime.Deviationsfromthestan-
dard should not anachronistically be assumed to be deviations from the not yet
established Classical Arabic standard, but instead should be compared against
other documents of their time, including the qct. Only this waywe can deduce
what the contemporary linguistic norms were.
Another question is the linguistic position of pre-Islamic and early Islamic
poetry. The equation of the poetry with standard Classical Arabic and the lan-
guage of the Quran all too often means that interesting linguistic variation that
occurs in the poetry gets glossed over. These corpora deserve careful linguistic
study in their own right. While certainly the poetry is much more linguistically
mixed than other sources of early Arabic, it strikes me as likely that different

poets from different regions are likely to use certain features more than others.
The amount of times we must assume the loss of hamzah due to meter in the
poetry of Ibn ʔabī Rabīʕah, as shown by Schwarz (1901), for example, is quite
striking and should probably be seen in the context of him being a Hijazi poet.
Any comments of this kind have mostly been impressionistic and incidental
and a systematic linguistic study of the material is direly needed.

Notes on Orthography, Phonology and Morphology
of the Quranic Consonantal Text
A.1
Introduction
This appendix serves as a more detailed discussion for some of the topics of the
language of the Quranic Consonantal Text that have come up throughout this
book. As previous works on the language and orthography of the Quran have
mostly relied on the Cairo Edition, which is not always an accurate reflection of
the Uthmanic Text, this appendix aims to add some more detailed discussion
to questions of orthography, phonology and morphology of Quranic Arabic.
Throughout the book there are several references to this appendix, but I have
also included topics of note here which do not receive direct discussion in the
book. It is hoped that this appendix can function as a short but useful guide to
some of the main features of Quranic Arabic on its own. In some cases, discus-
sions here rely on observations and generalizations of the orthography found
in early Quranic manuscripts.Whenever I do so, I refer to Appendix B, which is
a list of relevant tables that compares the orthography of certain words across
early Quranic manuscripts.
A.2
Orthography
The Quranic orthography was studied in great detail by Werner Diem (1976;
1979; 1980;1982)in aseriesof highlyinsightfuland in-deptharticleswhichtrace
the rise and development of Quranic orthographic practice from its Nabataean
Aramaic origins. Diem exclusively relied on the orthography as found in the
Cairo Edition, which has occasionally caused him to draw the wrong conclu-
sions about the principles of Quranic orthography as they must have been
present in the ut. Quite often, we find that early Quranic manuscripts consis-
tently agree with each other on certain topics of orthographic practice, where
the Cairo Edition differs from this practice. In this section I will discuss the
main orthographic practices of Quranic Arabic, which will necessarily overlap
on occasion with the observations made by Diem.

A.2.1
The Spelling of ā
In Pre-Islamic Arabic written in the Nabataean script, and transitional Nabat-
aeao-Arabic there was no way to write word-internal ā (unlike ī, and ū). With
the loss of the glottal stop in Quranic Arabic, the ʔalif gave rise to a new word-
internal mater lectionis for /ā/ (Diem 1979, §60–68; van Putten 2018).1 In the
qct, the use of ʔalif for writing /ā/ is still largely optional, and it is one of
the main points of disagreement between different Quranic manuscripts (van
Putten 2019c, 281–286). Despite this unstable status of the spelling, several gen-
eralizations can be made about its spelling.
In the qct defective spellings of ā are very common, but highly uncommon
in words of the shape CāC and CāC̄ (Diem 1979, §67). The exception to this
being the spelling of the verb ‘to say’ /qāl/ which in early Islamic documents is
almost without exception spelled defectively, لقan archaic spelling retained in
this one high frequency word, the same is true for, for example its plural form
قلوا
.2 In the ce the special status of the verb qāla has almost completely disap-
peared, and is generally spelled plene as other verbs of this type. However,قل
recited as qāla occurs in Q21:112, Q23:112,114 and Q43:24.3
The defective spelling of the feminine plural ending /-āt/ is standard in the
Uthmanicorthography.Intheceonly‘ تانبdaughters’isregularlyspelledplene.
Besides these there are three specific exceptions: Q41:12سموات
‘heavens’ (versus
189timesthatitisspelledسموت
,)Q41:16تاسحنمايا
‘unfortunatedays’andQ42:22
روضات الجنات
‘the flowering meadows of the gardens’.These unique exceptions
of these verses do not seem to be a feature of the ut. Forالجنات
/ǧannāt/ ‘gar-
dens’, the plene spelling is regular in early manuscripts, just likeبنات
/banāt/
‘daughters’, and not just used in the position Q42:22. It appears that if the stem
+ the feminine plural ending would only be three letters long if the feminine
1 This same feature is well-attested in early Islamic Arabic, and generally recognized to be part
of Pre-Classical orthography (Blau 1967, §9.1; 2002, 35, §26; Hopkins 1984, §10).
2 A lack of awareness of the special status of qāla has led to some confusion in epigraphic
research. The extremely common formulaاللهم اغفر ]…[ لمن قل/قال امين
‘O God, forgive […]
whoever says Amen’, is misread by Grohmann (1962, 148–149; Z 256, Z 257) asاللهم اغفر ]…[
لمن فا امين
‘O God, grant pardon […] to everyone who returns, Amen’. cf. the same formula
with( لاقal-Kilābī 2009, nos. 78, 215) and with( لقal-Kilābī 2009, nos. 49, 90). A similar mis-
understanding is found in the edition of the 31ah gravestone inscription from Aswan, where
line 4–5استغفر له اذا قرا هذا الـكتب وقل امينshould be understood as “and ask (Allah) pardon
for him (the deceased) when he reads this writing and says Amen”, and not how it is trans-
lated “(passer by) When reading this inscription ask pardon for him (the deceased) and say
Amen!” (El-Hawary 1930, 322).
3 In all of these cases, the choice of spelling these defectively seems to be an attempt to accom-
modate the other canonical readings, which in these places disagree on the reading of this
word. Some of them thus read it as qul (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3640, §3705, §3706, §4154).

In the qct, ā two syllables removed from the stress, such as in plural G-stem
active participles and duals CāCiCū/īn, CāCiCāt and CāCiCān/ayn (as well as
العلمين
/al-ʕālamīn/) are consistently spelled defectively. Diem (1979, §67.2; 1980,
§105) notices this rule too, but observes that in the ce, hollow verbs break this
patterns and are consistently spelled plene (as are the singulars), e.g. Q7:4قايلون
‘sleeping at noon’. This is however an idiosyncracy of the ce. In early Quranic
manuscripts these words simply follow the same rule as other plurals of this
pattern and are spelled defectively (van Putten 2018, 108f.).
The vocative prefix /yā-/ is consistently spelled defectively throughout the
Quran, and this is without exception, e.g.يموسى
‘O Mūsā’ (Q2:55 and passim),
يمريم
‘O Maryam’ (Q3:37 and passim), etc.5
Whenever the 1pl. suffix -nā is followed by any other clitic, it is consistently
spelled defectively, e.g.رزقنهم
‘we provided them’ (Q2:3),ارسلنك
‘we have sent
you’ (Q2:119).
A.2.2
Questions of Double yāʔ, wāw and ʔalif
Diem (1979, §37–43) discusses the avoidance of double matres yāʔ and wāw in
detail, and argues that the sequences of yī and wū are typically written with
only a single yāʔ and wāw respectively, whereas other phonetic sequences may
still have these two consonants in a row. However, the facts as they appear in
the ce are not very representative of the ut, and as a result the analysis does
not hold up.
For the,ىDiem cites cases such as ceىلو
/waliyy-ī/ ‘my friend’ (Q7:196;
Q12:101); ceيحى
/yuḥyī/ ‘he revives’ (Q2:73) and ceيستحى
/yastaḥyī/ ‘he is
ashamed’ (Q2:26). However, in early Quranic manuscripts all of these are con-
sistently spelled with two yāʔs, and therefore the ut had two yāʔs (see B.2).6
4 The common defective spelling of the feminine plural ending also occurs in early Islamic
inscriptions, but is misunderstood by Grohmann (1962, Z 48), who interpretsصلوت اللهas a
singular ‘the blessing of God’ rather than ‘the blessings of God’, cf.صلوات الله
(al-Rāšid 2009,
242). Likewise, Grohmann translatesرحمت الله وبركته عليك
‘the Mercy and blessing of God
may be upon you’ takingبركتهas a singular (Grohmann 1962, Z 150, Z 171), but this formula
certainly has the plural /barakāt-uh/, cf.رحمت الله وبركاته عليكم
(Grohmann 1962, Z 225).
5 This practice is also attested in early Islamic Papyri (Hopkins 1984, §10d), in the Ibn Wahb
literary papyrus (Blau 1999, 124). Several clear cases are found in early Islamic inscriptions as
well, e.g.يرحمن
(al-Kilābī 2009, no. 35),‘ بريO my lord’ (Grohmann 1962, nos. 165, 232).
6 The origin of this innovation in the Cairo Edition appears to come from Al-Dānī’s al-Muqniʕ

With these forms shown to be innovations of the ce, the amount of examples
where a singleىis used to write a sequence /yī/ becomes very small, whereas
there are several more examples where a doubleىis used even in de ce,
e.g.يحييكم

/ʔa-fa-ʕayīnā/ ‘where

/ʕilliyyīn/ ‘Elyon’ (Q83:18).
Diem (1979, §41) considers the outcome of baʔīs (Q7:165) spelledبيسto be
a reflection of /bayīs/, but it seems doubtful that this is the correct analysis.
First, it is not clear that *baʔīs is the word whichبيسis supposed to repre-
sent, as in the canonical reading traditions it is variously recited as bīsin, biʔsin,
bayʔasin and baʔīsin (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3150).7 *biʔsin would of course yield /bīs/,
for whichبيسis the only acceptable spelling, and *bayʔasin would presumably
yield/bayas/or/bayyas/,againبيسbeingtheonlyacceptablespelling.Buteven
if Diem is right to assume that *baʔīs is the origin of whatبيسrepresents, it is
quite probable that the outcome of *baʔīs after the loss of *ʔ was not bayīs but
rather bayyis aligning with the outcome of the CaCīC adjectival pattern of hol-
low roots such as mayyit ‘dead’ (cf. Blau 1967, §11.4.1.1) for which, once again,
بيسwould be the expected spelling. For these reasons this word is not a very
good example of avoidance of two yāʔs in the sequence yī.8
The examples that are left, then all have in common that they either have
they correspond to the Classical Arabic sequence iyyī/īʔī or āʔī. The examples

who mentions that the Qurans of Medina and Iraq spell these words with only one yāʔ, a
practice copied by the Cairo Edition (Al-Dānī al-Muqniʕ, 56).
7 Among the non-canonical readings there are moreover reports of bayʔisin, bīsin, baysin and
biʔīs (Ibn Xālawayh muxtaṣar, 47).
8 One might also consider the reading /bāyis/ < *bāʔisin, which would be in line with the
orthographyبايسattested in BnF Arabe 6140a, although this could also be analysed as a case
of historical hamzah spelling see A.2.7.

like they should be considered the result of a genuine phonetic development,
rather than an orthographic convention. In the case of the nouns that have a
Classical Arabic sequence iyyīna or īʔīna it is likely that we are dealing with
a contraction to /-īn/. Diem (1979, §39) deems this unlikely, as he argues that
an oblique pluralالامين

/al-

ing analogical leveling in one direction or the other. This is, in fact, a possibil-
ity in the ʕarabiyyah, e.g.أعجمينʔaʕjamīna ‘the non-Arabs’ (Fischer 2002, §116,

opment seems to have been retained in transmission of Ibn Kaṯīr’s reading as

By extension it seems probable thatميكيلis to be understood as /mīkīl/.15
While double yāʔ avoidance when spelling yī does not appear to have been
an orthographic principle, this seems to be different for double wāw avoid-
ance when spelling wū (cf. Diem 1979, §40). In post-consonantal position, the
sequence /wū/ is indeed written with a single wāw.This is exemplified by forms
of the verb lawā ‘to distort; to turn around’:يلون
/yalwūn/ ‘they distort’ (Q3:78),
تلون
/talwūn/ ‘you will [not] turn around’ (Q3:153) andتلوا
/talwū/ ‘you distort’
(Q4:135).16 We can likewise see this avoidance of two wāws in word-initial posi-
tion we findورى
/wūrī/ ‘was concealed’ (Q7:20). It seems likely that we can
also countفاوا
/fāwū/ ‘so retreat!’ (Q18:16) andالغاون
/al-ġāwūn/ ‘the deviators’
(Q26:224). The pronunciation ofداود, دواد
‘David’ is difficult to determine, so
it is not entirely certain whether that should be interpreted as an example of
double wāw avoidance (see A.2.8).
Diem takes ancient sequence *aʔū(na) of iii-ʔ stems in the plural as having
developedto/awū(n)/.Itseemslikelyhoweverthatiii-ʔandiii-w/ystemshave
merged completely and these should rather be read as /aw(n)/. From spellings
such asيستهزون
/yastahzūn/ < *yastahziʔūna it is clear that at least the *iʔū
sequence has merged completely with iii-w/y stems. Indeed, in the reading tra-
ditions we see this with some of these verbs, with etymological -aʔūna forms,
e.g. ʔabū Ǧaʕfar’s yaṭawna ‘they step’ < *yaṭaʔūna and murǧawna ‘postponed’
probably < *murǧaʔūna (see §6.5.5).
Diem likewise analyses the adjectivesروف
‘compassionate’ andيوس
‘des-
pairing’ as evidence of aʔū > awū being represented by a single wāw. Once
again one has to wonder whether this is a correct identification. For, فورDiem

‘you distort’ (Q4:135) is also read as talū by Ḥamzah and Ibn ʕāmir (Ibn al-Ǧazarī
§2962), so may not represent an example of this. The interpretation of the reading talū
seems somewhat controversial. Al-Farrāʔ (Maʕānī i, 291) derives it from a root lʔy, which
he claims has the same meaning as tatawallaw ‘they follow in succession’. Ibn Xālawayh
(Ḥuǧǧah, 127) see it as a G-stem of the root wly.

implicitly assumes that the Ḥafṣreading raʔūf is the origin of the word rep-
resented, and thus reconstruct /rawūf/, however, all other Kufan readers read
raʔuf (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2731), which would presumably yield /rawuf/ or perhaps
/rawf/ after the loss of the hamzah, where spelling with a single wāw would be
expected.يوسis universally recited as yaʔūs, but yaʔus is reported in Arabic
lexicography(Lisān4945c),thuslikewiseopeningupthepossibilityof theread-
ing /yawus/. If his assumption that these come from CaCūC adjectival patterns
holds up, however, these may indeed be good examples of wū being spelled
with a single wāw, assuming that *aʔū did not yield /awwu/ rather than /awū/
in this position.
To this he adds several other probable examples of this orthographic prac-
tice like al-mawʔūdahالموده
/al-mawūdah/ ‘the buried alive girl’ (Q81:8) andيوده
/yawūdu-h/ ‘it tires him’ (Q2:255). After the loss of hamzahروس
‘heads’ prob-
ably became /rūs/ (Q2:279) as the plural of /rās/ in analogy to /sāq/ pl. /sūq/
(incidentally also read as suʔūq, see §6.4.10), but /ruwūs/ cannot be excluded.
Like double wāw, the sequence of double ʔalif is avoided. This is clearest
in the case of nouns that end in ʔalif mamdūdah, followed by an indefinite
accusative. Rhyme confirms that such sequences where indeed pronounced
with two syllables, e.g.انشا
/inšāʔā/ ‘a creation’ (Q56:35), yet they are spelled
with only one ʔalif.
This same avoidance is found with the question particle/ اʔa-/. When it
combines with words that start with /ʔa-, ʔi-, ʔu-/, it is generally spelled with
just a single ʔalif, e.g.انتم
/ʔa-ʔantum/ (or /āntum/?) ‘are you?’ (Q2:140),انك
/ʔa-(y)innaka/ ‘are you?’ (Q37:52),انزل
/a-(w)unzila/ ‘has it been revealed?’
(Q38:8). Occasionally however, such sequences are spelled phonetically rather
than morpho-phonemically, in which case a glide is written in the place of the
word-initial vowel that followers the question particle, e.g.اينكم
/a-yinna-kum/
‘do you?’ (Q6:19),اونبيكم
/ʔa-wunabbī-kum/ ‘shall I inform you?’ (Q3:15). Both
spellings may even occur in a single verse, e.g.ايذا متنا وكنا ترابا وعظما انا لمبعوثون
/a-yiḏā mutnā wa-kunnā turābā wa-ʕiẓāmā a-(y)innā (or innā)17 la-mabʕūṯūn/
‘When we die and become dust and bones, will we be resurrected’ (Q56:47, cf.
also the identical phrase in Q23:82 and Q37:16, where /a-(y)iḏā/ is spelled.) اذا
A.2.3
ʔalif al-Wiqāyah
A place where the orthography of the qct diverges rather sharply from Classi-
cal Arabic orthography is in its use of the so-called ʔalif al-wiqāyah. In Classical

There is significant disagreement among the readers whether to read these words with a
question particle in front of both, for a discussed see Ibn al-Ǧazarī (§1413).

Arabic, an ʔalif is written after word-final wāw only when this wāw denotes
the verbal plural ending (Wright 1896, §7a). In the qct, its use is much more
widespread, and regularly appears after any word-final /ū/ or /aw/, regardless
of whether it is the plural verb or not (Nöldeke et al. 2013, 418f.). This highly
morphological spelling of Classical Arabic is thus an innovation. Examples
of the broader use of the ʔalif al-wiqāyah are, e.g.كفروا
/kafarū/ ‘they disbe-
lieved’ (passim),مشوا
/mašaw/ ‘they walked’ (Q2:20),يدعوا
/yadʕū/ ‘he calls’
(Q2:221);18ملقوا ربهم
/mulāqū rabbi-hum/ ‘meeting of their lord’ (Q2:46);ناكسوا
روسهم
/nākisū rūsi-hum/ ‘the hanging of their heads’ (Q32:12). The relative pro-
noun /ḏū/ which in the ce follows the Classical Spelling, وذis consistently
spelledذواin early Quranic manuscripts (Déroche 2009, 65).
There is only one casein the qct where ʔalif al-wiqāyahisnot usedfor word-
final /-ū/, where we would expect it to be spelled, namelyيعفو
/yaʕfū/ ‘that he
forgive’ (Q4:99) (see B.3). An exception to the general rule that whenever word-
final /-aw/ occurs it should be written with ʔalif al-wiqāyah, are cases where a
/w/ immediately precedes. Thus we findاوو
/ʔāwaw/ ‘they gave shelter’ (Q8:72,
74) and/ وولlawwaw, lawaw/19 ‘they turn aside’ (Q63:5). This orthographic prac-
tice is lost in the ce, but is consistent in early Quranic manuscripts (see B.4).
There are two other words that end in /-aw/ words which in the ce are written
without ʔalif al-wiqāyah, one of them certainly had the ʔalif al-wiqāyah in the
ut, namely,سعوا
/saʕaw/ ‘they strove’ (Q34:5) and another whose data is a bit
more ambiguous, as several very ancient manuscripts have the ʔalif al-wiqāyah
while (mostly) later ones lack it, namely:عتو)ا(
/ʕataw/ ‘and they became inso-
lent’ (Q25:21), see B.4.
Nöldeke et al. (2013, 418f.) object to the possibility that the ʔalif al-wiqāyah
is intended to represent the phonetic value /ū/ and /aw/, and instead suggest
that “every finalوis followed by an”اand “exceptions to the rule can be eas-
ily explained”. However, one of the main exceptions is not addressed at all:
All nouns that end in a consonantal /w/, either when preceded by a conso-
nant, or when part of word-final /uww/ are consistently spelled without ʔalif
al-wiqāyah. Examples of word-final -Cw are:العفو
/al-ʕafw/ ‘the surplus; the for-
giveness’ (Q2:219; Q7:199),باللغو
/bi-l-laġw/ (Q2:225; Q5:89; Q25:72),اللغو
/al-laġw/
(Q23:3; Q28:55),/ وغلlaġw/ (Q52:23) ‘idle talk’,/ وهلlahw/ (Q6:32; Q29:64; Q31:6;
Q47:36; Q57:20),اللهو
/al-lahw/ (Q62:11) ‘amusement’,البدو
/al-badw/ ‘the desert’
18
Thus, Quranic orthography is unable to make the distinction between the homophonous
yadʕū ‘he calls’ and yadʕū ‘they call (subjunctive/jussive)’ which in Classical orthography
is expressed asيدعوversusيدعوا
.
19
Ibn al-Ǧazarī (§4397) reports both variants lawaw (Nāfiʕ and Rawḥ) and lawwaw (the
rest).

(12:100). Words that end in word-final -uww are:عدو
/ʕaduww/ ‘enemy’ (Q2:36,
and passim),العدو
/al-ʕaduww/ ‘the enemy’ (Q63:4),بالغدو
/bi-l-ġuduww/ ‘in

/la-ʕafuww/ ‘surely oft-pardoning’
(Q22:60; Q58:2),عتو
/ʕutuww/ ‘arrogance’ (Q67:21). The rule as formulated by
Nöldekeetal.doesnotaccountforthis,whereasthephoneticdefinition(which
they object to): wāw+ʔalif al-wiqāyah denotes /ū/ or /aw/, does.
Diem (1979, §47) tries retain the orthographic rule formulated by Nöldeke et
al. while taking these forms into account. The orthographic rule he formulates,
however, is sufficiently complex that it would take a linguist to be able to spell
correctly.Hesuggeststhattheʔalif al-wiqāyahisonlyusedof theʔalif couldnot
be mistaken for the indefinite accusative.This does a reasonable job at explain-
ing laġwun( وغلQ52:23) versus laġwanاوغل
(Q56:25), although even this requires
a rather complex process of the scribe of needing to work through counterfac-
tual readings, in order to ensure the ʔalif does not get written accidentally. But
itbecomesespeciallydifficulttosquarewiththefactthatthedefiniteformdoes
not take the ʔalif al-wiqāyah either, e.g. al-laġwiاللغو
(Q23:3), a context where
writing the ʔalif al-wiqāyah could never lead to a confusion with the indefinite
accusative.
Moreover,Diem’sruleisbasedonthemistakenassumptionthatluʔluʔ ‘pearl’
distinguishes the indefinite accusative luʔluʔanلولواfrom the other casesلولوfor
luʔluʔun and luʔluʔin.This, however, is an idiosyncrasy of the ce. In the ut, this
word always received the ʔalif al-wiqāyah also in the nominative and genitive
form (see B.6).
Since indeed the use of ʔalif al-wiqāyah in these words is most readily
explained phonetically, it being used whenever it is vocalic /ū/ or diphthon-
gal /aw/, whereas when it is consonantal it is spelled without, it seems to me
that contrary to the popular belief, the ʔalif al-wiqāyah does represent a pho-
netic value, rather than it being a purely orthographic practice (and certainly
not a ‘word-divider’).
The reason why /ū/ and /aw/ are treated the same may be up for debate.
First, it is of course possible that Quranic Arabic had lost final /aw/ of the verbs.
In many modern dialects, e.g. Damascene Arabic, the final weak ending -aw
has been lost completely and merged with -ū, e.g. katabu ‘they wrote’ and banu
‘they built’ not **bano (Cowell 1964, 55, 61). It is possible that these merged in
Quranic Arabic although a more conservative reconstruction seems prudent.
Another point of comparison here is the treatment of diphthongs in the
Old Arabic as reflected in the Safaitic inscriptional corpus. Safaitic orthogra-
phy never writes vowels with matres lectionis. Thus, /ū/ is never expressed with
⟨w⟩. Perhaps surprisingly, the diphthong /aw/ is treated the same, and is like-
wise never expressed in writing whereas consonantal /w/ is expressed with

appendix a
⟨w⟩. Thus, to the speakers of the Safaitic Old Arabic dialect, the diphthong
/aw/ was treated as a true diphthong, that is more similar to a long vowel than
a vowel+consonant sequence (Al-Jallad 2015, 37f.).
The treatment of /aw/ and /ay/ as being distinct from other consonantal
uses, and more akin to the long vowels, is also something we see in their treat-
ment in the Arabic grammatical tradition. Thus, the ḥurūf al-līn are the use of
ʔalif, yāʔ and wāw when a vowel precedes, in words like: nār ‘fire’—envisioned
as /naAr/, dār /daAr/ ‘house’, fīl /fiyl/ ‘elephant’, qīla /qiyla/ ‘it is said’, ḥūla
/ḥuwla/‘itwaschanged’ġūl /ġuwl/‘ogre’,bayt ‘house’andṯawb‘garment’(Lisān,
4117c).20
In light of this it seems quite likely, and phonologically plausible that the
ʔalif al-wiqāyah was used as a tool to write word-final ‘vocalic’ uses of wāw, i.e.
/ū/ and /aw/ as opposed to consonantal uses of wāw.
Another argument that Nöldeke et al. bring up to not take this as a phono-
logical spelling, but rather a ‘place wāw after every wāw’ rule is that it is placed
after verbs in the subjunctive, such asيعفوا
,
تعفوا
(Q2:237),لتتلوا
(Q13:30),لن ندعوا
(Q18:14),ان اتلوا
(Q27:92)ليربوا
(Q30:39),ليبلوا
(Q47:4)نبلوا
(Q47:31), which accord-
ing to them must be verbs ending in -uwa not -ū. This presupposes that the
Quranic reading traditions are an accurate representation of the language of
the qct, and final short vowels were not lost in such verbs. Neither of these
assumptions are justified.The fact that these verbs are treated exactly the same
as verbs that end in -ū in Classical Arabic rather speaks in favour of the loss of
the final short vowels, something that I have also argued on different grounds
in Chapter 7 and Van Putten & Stokes (2018).
An exceptionally difficult issue is the treatment of the ʔalif al-wiqāyah in
roots that originally contained hamzah. While some of these behave exactly as
expected, it is especially the historical sequences *-aʔu and *āʔu that paint a
rather complex picture. Nöldeke et al. (2013, 419) object to seeing the ʔalif al-
wiqāyah as a phonetic marking for /ū/ and /aw/ as against consonantal /w/,
because many words of the type have final hamzah. This, again, presupposes
that the Quranic reading traditions are an accurate reflection of the language
of the qct, which certainly in the case of the hamzah cannot be accepted. It is
quite clear that Quranic Arabic had lost hamzah completely (see §5.2) which
20
Ibn al-Ǧazarī (§948, §950, §1234, §1343) makes an explicit distinction between ḥurūf
al-madd (ū, ī, ā) and ḥarfay al-līn (aw, ay). This does not appear to be a distinction sys-
tematically made by the early grammarians like Sībawayh, which seems to use the terms
indiscriminately,andoftenusesthecompoundtermhurūf al-maddwa-l-līn.Evenif itwere
an ancient distinction, the two terms are still clearly distinguished from uses of wāw and
yāʔ were a consonant, rather than a vowel, precedes.

has given rise to many forms of artifical and pseudocorrect hamzah use all
throughout the reading traditions (see Chapter 6 and §3.6.1). In the following
sections we will discuss the different contexts where ʔalif al-wiqāyah appears
where the words etymologically contained a hamzah.
A.2.3.1
ʔalif al-wiqāyah for Stem Final *uʔ
When it comes to stem final *uʔ, regardless of what vowel would historically
follow, the word is always spelled with ʔalif al-wiqāyah. Thusامروا
/imrū/ ‘man’
(Q4:176),لولوا
/lūlū/ ‘pearl’ (Q52:24),اللولوا
‘the pearl’ (Q55:22; Q56:23). In the
Cairo Edition some these forms of ‘pearl’ are spelled without ʔalif al-wiqāyah,
but this not original to the ut, see B.6.
In the case of the indefiniteلولوا
‘pearl’, the spelling is thus ambiguous
whether it represents nominative/genitive /lūlū/ or accusative /lūluwā/. This
ambiguity has indeed lead to disagreement in the Quranic reading traditions
where the word may be read both as a genitive luʔluʔin, lūluʔin and as an
accusative luʔluʔan, lūluʔan (Q22:23; Q35:33, see Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3652).
A.2.3.2
Treatment of Stem-Final *ūʔ
In nouns, etymological sequences of stem-final *ūʔ behave exactly the same as
stem-final /uww/, and thus are spelled without ʔalif al-wiqāyah:قرو
/quruww/
(< qurūʔ-) ‘menstruations’ (Q2:228)/ وسsuww/ (< *sūʔ-) ‘the wickedness of …’
(Q2:49, and passim),بالسو
‘wickedness’ (Q2:169, and passim),السو
‘wickedness’
(Q4:17, and passim). Of course, in the indefinite accusatives, these receive a
final ʔalif as the mark of the indefinite accusative, e.g.سوا
/suwwā/ ‘wicked-
ness’ (Q4:110)
In the verbal system, however, we find these spelled with ʔalif al-wiqāyah in
the two instances that it occurs. What is recited in the reading tradition as la-
tanūʔu is spelledلتنوا
‘would be a burden’ (Q28:76) and what is recited as tabūʔa
is spelledتبوا
‘that you bear’ (Q5:29). This is likely the result of analogical level-
ing due to a partial paradigmatic levelling of the ii-w, iii-ʔ imperfect paradigm
with the iii-w paradigm:

The merger of ii-w, iii-ʔ verbs with iii-w verbs towards ending in /-ū(n)/ may
perhapsbevisibleinليسوا
/li-yasū/(Q17:7)whichisvariouslyreadasli-yasūʔū‘so
that they will sadden’, li-yasūʔa ‘so that he will sadden’ and li-nasūʔa ‘so that we
will sadden’ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3447). If the majority reading yasūʔū was indeed
the grammatical form intended, then it seems that the Quranic Arabic pronun-
ciation of this was /li-yasū/.
A.2.3.3
Treatment of Word-Final *āʔū
Unlike Classical Arabic spelling, ii-w/y, iii-ʔ verbs in the in the perfect 3pl.m.
form are spelled without an ʔalif al-wiqāyah, e.g.وباو
/bāw/ ‘they returned’
(Q2:61);فاو
/fāw/ ‘they returned’ (Q2:226),21جاو
/ǧāw/ ‘they came’ (Q3:184)
and alsoراو
/rāw/ ‘they saw’22 (Q2:166; Q7:149; Q10:54; Q12:35; Q19:75; Q28:64;
Q34:33; Q37:14; Q40:84, 85; Q42:44; Q62:11; Q72:24). The last of these is spelled
راواin the Cairo Edition, but this is not original to the ut, see B.7. As word-
final /ū/ is otherwise always spelled with ʔalif al-wiqāyah, this suggests that
word-final *āʔū shifted to /āw/, rather than **āwū as Diem (1979, §65) sug-
gests.
Of exceptional status isاسوا
‘they did evil’ (Q30:10; Q53:31) which is univer-
sally recited as ʔasāʔū and thus we would rather expect the spelling **اساو
.But
indeed, in early Quranic manuscripts, the spelling is as it is found in the Cairo
edition (see B.16). This spelling thus seems to suggest a pronunciation /ʔasaw/
rather than /ʔasāw/. As this is the only C-stem perfect in the 3pl.m. of stems of
this type, it is difficult to be sure about this analysis.
A.2.3.4
Word-Final *aʔū
Plural hamzated verbs that historically end in *aʔ-ū are likewise spelled with
the ʔalif al-wiqāyah and are presumably pronounced /-aw/:تبروا
/tabarraw/
‘they disown’ (2:167),فادروا
/fa-draw/ ‘so avert!’ (3:168),اقروا
/iqraw/ ‘recite!’
(Q69:19),فاقروا
/fa-qraw/ ‘so recite!’ (Q73:20).
One verb lacks the final ʔalif al-wiqāyah:تبوو
/tabawwaw/ ‘they settled’
(Q59:9), thus showingsimilar behaviouras the verbswithout an original *ʔ that
have /w/ before a final /-aw/, like/ وواʔāwaw/ ‘they gave shelter’ (Q8:72, 74) and
/ وولlawwaw, lawaw/ ‘they turn aside’ (Q63:5) discussed above.
21
It is worth appreciating how the qct aptly distinguishes this word fromفاوا
/fāwū/ < *fa-
ʔwū ‘so retreat!’ (Q18:16), which would have been homographic had the Classical Arabic
rule of the ʔalif al-wiqāyah been adhered to.
22
The Quranic Arabic perfect of ‘to see’ was /rāʔ/, not /raʔā/, see §5.11 for a discussion.

A.2.3.5
Word-Final *aʔu(n)
As for *aʔu sequences, verbs are overwhelmingly spelled with wāw and ʔalif
al-wiqāyah, with a couple of exceptions where it is simply spelled with ʔalif,
e.g.يبدوا
/yabdaw/ ‘he begins’ (Q10:4, 34 (2×); Q27:64; Q30:11, 27),تفتوا
/taftaw/
‘you will not cease’ (Q12:85),يتفيوا
/yatafayyaw/ ‘it inclines’ (Q16:48),اتوكوا
‘I lean’
/atawakkaw/ (Q20:18),لا تظموا
/lā taẓmaw/ ‘you will not be thirsty’ (Q20:119)
يدروا
/yadraw/ ‘he knows’ (Q24:8),ما يعبوا
/mā yaʕbaw/ ‘will not concern him-
self’ (Q25:77),ينشوا
/yunaššaw/ ‘is brought up’ (Q43:18),ينبوا
/yunabbaw/ ‘will
be informed’ (Q75:13). There are three exceptions to this general rule, namely
يستهحزا
/yustahzā/ ‘it is being ridiculed’ (Q4:140),يتبوا
/yatabawwā/ ‘he settles’
(Q12:56),نتبوا
/natabawwā/ ‘we settle’ (Q39:74).
For nouns, the ʔalif spelling is more common, although the spelling with
ʔalif al-wiqāyah occurs as well. Thus for *al-malaʔu ‘the chieftains’ we see:الملا
/al-malā/ (Q7:60 66, 75, 88, 90, 109, 127; Q11:27; Q12:43; Q23:33; Q28:38; Q38:6)
andالملوا
/al-malaw/ (Q23:24; Q27:29, 32, 38). The other noun, from *nabaʔu ‘the
news of’, on the other hand, occurs more often in the wāw + ʔalif al-wiqāyah
spelling:نبوا
/nabaw/ (Q14:9; Q38:21; Q64:5) but/ ابنnabā/ (Q9:70). The indefi-
nite form *nabaʔun ‘news’ is likewise spelledنبوا
(Q38:67) (see B.8, B.9).
The presence of these spelling with final wāw and ʔalif al-wiqāyah seems to
have an important implication for the relative chronology of final short vowels
and the hamzah, as it requires that hamzah was lost before the final short vow-
elswerelost.Theformsthataresimplyspelledwithʔalif areperhapsanalogical
levelling of the default form, as verbs that end in -ā do not usually show a dis-
tinction between the imperfective and aorist/apocopate, and likewise nouns
that end in -ā do not usually show a distinction between the nominative ver-
sus the accusative after the loss of final short vowels.23
A.2.3.6
Word-Final *āʔu
An especially vexing case of the issue of the ʔalif al-wiqāyah in words that ety-
mologically end in ʔalif mamdūdah followed by the nominative or imperfect
*-u. First of all, it should be said that unlike the reflexes of *aʔu—where the
distribution is almost 50/50—the vast majority of the words in this group are
simply spelled with the final ʔalif. However, there are 18 cases in the ce where a
spellingwithwāw+ʔalif al-wiqāyahshowsup.However,acloserlookatthedata
in early Quranic manuscripts shows that not all of these can be successfully
reconstructed with that spelling in the ut. B.10, B.11, B.12, B.13, and B.14 tabulate
23
The genitive seems to show similar free variation, but there is only evidence for it in con-
struct e.g.نباى المرسلين
(Q6:34) butمن نبا موسى
(Q28:3).

Of the 19 words spelled with the ʔalif al-wiqāyah, only six appear to have been
spelled as such in the ut, with one (نشواQ11:87) being somewhat unclear. In
five cases ǧazāʔu is not spelled asجزواorجزاbut asجزاوinstead, whereas the
spellingجزواis entirely absent. The normal spelling of ʔalif mamdūdah nouns
with simple ʔalif remains the majority spelling however (10 cases).
All cases of theاوspelling are nouns in construct (a place where final short
vowels appear to have been retained), and thusجزاوmay very well represent
/ǧazāwu/, with optional weakening of stem final hamzah, whereasجزاin iden-
tical context would represent /ǧazāʔu/. With a clitic following, this noun is

which is likewise stands in construct but has the ʔalif al-wiqāyah. A possible
solution is to not read this as a ʔaCCāC plural, but rather as a ʔaCCuC plural,
i.e. *ʔanbuʔu > ʔanbū, which would explain this spelling. Admittedly, however,
this solution is rather ad hoc.
The remaining words with the ʔalif al-wiqāyah spelling are all diptotic CuCa-
Cāʔu plurals that do not stand in construct. Among these nouns, spellings of
this type are fairly common with, five times appearing with the wāw+ʔalif al-
wiqāyah in the nominative, and 19 cases where it is spelled with ʔalif. Rabin
(1951, 110, §w) speculates (following Vollers) that these forms represent /aḍ-
ḍuʕafō/ with a final vowel /ō/, and he seems to think that there is no special
relationship between this spelling and the nominative. The fact that we never
see such spellings in non-nominative contexts (which are by no means uncom-
mon) however make this rather unattractive to assume that the original case
vowel plays no role here.
However, it is similarly unlikely to take these spelling as representing /āwu/,
or even /āʔu/ (as suggested by Diem 1981, §184a; and Nöldeke et al. 2013, 422).
In contexts much less ambiguous than the very specific context of CuCaCāʔu-
plurals, it seems to be clear that with such a sequence the spellingاوwould be
expected, at least usually (see the reflexes of *āʔū, and *ǧazāʔu above). I would
tentatively suggest that for reasons currently not entirely clear, the outcome
of diptotic *CuCaCāʔu indeed is /CuCaCō/, creating a diptotic case distinction
not dissimilar to the sound masculine plural with /CuCaCō/ in the nominative
and /CuCaCāʔ/ (or /CuCaCā/?) in the oblique. Quranic Arabic then represents
a stage where such nominatives have mostly, but not entirely, been analogically
levelled.
Thedifferenceinbehaviorof thediptoticpluralsmayverywellbebecauseof
their lack of nunation. Thus *-āʔu, *āʔa became /-ō, -ā/, because there was no
nunation to guard this contraction, whereas *-āʔun, *āʔin, *āʔan were exempt
from this contraction and became /-āʔ, -āʔ, -āʔā/. This may also explain why
*ʔawliyāʔu- when followed by pronominal clitics appears to behave as ending
in ʔalif maqṣūrah /ʔawliyā-hum/ rather than ʔalif mamdūdah **/ʔawliyāwu-
hum/ (see A.4.11). Without further data this hypothesis will have to remain
speculative.

asربا
(Q30:39) (see B.15). This alternation betweenواandاspelling may at first
glance seem similar the treatment of the *CuCaCāʔu plurals discussed above.
However, unlike the nouns above, this spelling is not unique to the nomina-
tive, but is found in all cases but the nominative, e.g.الذين ياكلون الربوا
“those
who devour usury (acc.)” (Q2:275),مثل الربوا
“like usury (gen.)” (Q2:275).
It is quite unclear what the etymological backgroundof this wordis and how
to interpret it. In the Quranic reading traditions it is either read as ar-ribā or ar-
ribē (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1974), but on the basis of the spelling with wāw, it has been
argued that it should be /ar-ribō/ (Rabin 1951, 105; Nöldeke et al. 2013, 418). As
Rabin points out, this is an opinion, already endorsed by al-Zamaxšarī (Kaš-
šāf, i, 319). However, there are no other stems with /ō/ as a word-final vowel,
regardless of case—and there is no obvious etymological origin for this vowel
to appear in this context. As shown by Van Putten (2017a), *awV- yields /ā/ in
Quranic Arabic, not /ō/, and thus we would expect *ar-ribawa to have yielded
**الربا
/ar-ribā/, or perhaps evenالربى
/ar-ribē/.24 Due to the unusual position
of this word, Rabin (1951, 109, §u) seems justified in assuming that the word is
likely a borrowing of some kind, but the exact linguistic origin remains unclear.

It should be clear that the two spellingsواand
)ا(وare in quite strict comple-
mentary distribution, clearly suggesting a phonetic origin for these spellings.
The only environment where such spellings appear to be in competition is in
the *-āʔu(n) sequence. However, as we saw above even here the two spellings
appear to be mostly in complementary distribution, whereاوis reserved for
triptotic nominative nouns in construct, andواis reserved for diptotic nouns
in the nominative definite and indefinite form. It therefore seems quite reason-
able to suggest that indeedواis used to write /-ū/ and /-aw/, whereasوmarks

Spelling of la- ‘Indeed’ asلا
In the Quran the asseverative la- is frequently spelledلاbefore 1sg. form of
the verb.25 It is attested once in the ce inلااذبحنه
/la-ʔaḏbaḥanna-h/ ‘I will
surely slaughter him’ (Q27:21), but attested in quite a few more places in Early
Quranic Manuscripts, for exampleفلااقطعن
/fa-la-ʔuqaṭṭiʕann/ ‘So surely I will
cut off’ (Q20:71 in sm1a);لااكيدن
/la-ʔakīdann/ ‘surely I will plan’ (Q21:57 in W,
T26);لااملن
/la-ʔamlānna/ ‘I will surely fill’ (Q32:13 in W,27 T;28 Q38:85 in bl);
ولااغوينهم
/wa-la-ʔuġwiyanna-hum/ ‘and surely I will mislead them’ (Q15:39 in
Arabe 334c);ولاامرنهم
/wa-la-ʔāmuranna-hum/ ‘I will surely command them’
(Q4:119 in W, Arabe 330b);ولاادخلنكم
‘I will certainly admit you’ (Q5:12 in Arabe
324c);29لااقتلنك
/la-ʔaqtulanna-k/ ‘I will surely kill you’ (Q5:27 in W,30 cpp,
bl31);لااتينهم
/la-ʔatiyanna-hum/ ‘I will surely come to them’ (Q7:17 in S, sm1a,
K);لااصلبنكم
/la-ʔuṣallibanna-kum/ ‘I will surely crucify you’ (Q7:124 in cpp,32);

/la-
ʔuʕaḏḏibanna-hū/ ‘I will surely punish him’ (Q27:21 in W, T).
Besides these extra places in the Quran where we attest such spellings, there
are also some disagreements among the reading traditions about whether cer-
tain phrases should be read with lā or asseverative la- that seem to stem from
this spelling practice. For example, Qunbul ʕan Ibn Kaṯīr reads Q10:16لو شا الله
25
Blau (1967, §8.2) gives several clear examples of this same orthographic feature in early
Christian Arabic, e.g.لااقرن
‘I shall admit’,لااعدلن
‘I shall return’,لاابيعنك للبربر
‘I swear I
shall sell you to the Berbers’,لااصنعها
‘I shall do it’, etc.

lā ʔadrā-kum bi-hī “nor would he have made it known to you” (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,

reads lā ʔuqsimu bi-yawmi l-qiyāmah ‘No! I swear by the day of resurrection’
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3247).35
Sidky (2021, 181) points out that it was already noticed early on that this
surprising early orthography could yield significant ambiguities as both the
asseverative and negative indicative would end up being spelled exactly the
same, which al-Farrāʔ criticitices as being “of the terrible spelling practices of
those of old” (wa-huwaminsūʔihiǧāʔil-ʔawwalīna) (Al-Farrāʔ Maʕānī, i, 295f.).
The spelling asلاis not just restricted to cases of the asseverative particle
before a 1sg. verb, but can occur before any word that starts with a hamzah; Al-
Dānī (Muqniʕ, 36) reports the spellingلااوضعوا
‘they were active’ (Q9:47), which
isindeedattestedinearlymanuscripts(gk;bl;RampurRaza).Andlikewise,for
the asseverative particle combined with the prepositionالىwe find the spelling
لاالى
(Q3:158: S, W,36 Q47, gk,37 cpp; Q37:68: W, Arabe 333d), as pointed out by
Diem (1979, §26). A close examination of early manuscripts will likely uncover
even more cases.

It is common in early copies of the Kufic C style to write the prepositions ʕalā
and ḥattā asعلاandحتاrather than the now standardعلىandحتى
(Cellard 2015,
208–213), manuscripts of this type appear to always be of Medinan regionality
(Cellard 2015, 168–186; see also van Putten 2019a, see especially 356, note 122).
This alternate spelling is also found once in the ce for ladā:لدى
(Q40:18) and
لدا
(Q12:25). These three words are exactly the words with ʔalif maqṣūrah that
reading traditions that have iii-w ʔimālah (see §3.3.3.3) normally read as /ā/,
despitetheirspelling(Ibnal-Ǧazarī,§1973),38andḥattāisexplicitlymentioned
34
Surprisingly, this reading is not mentioned by Ibn Muǧāhid (121), despite Qunbul being his
direct teacher.
35
Most works mention explicitly that Q75:2ولا اقسم بالنفس اللوامهis read as wa-lā ʔuqsimu
bi-n-nafsi l-lawāmah ‘And nay! I swear by the reproaching soul’ even by Qunbul, although
here too a reading wa-la-ʔuqsimu seems more natural.

Also, the prepositionالىis read as /ʔilā/ rather /ʔilē/, but this word is not commonly
spelled( الاbut see the corrected spelling ofالاtoىلاin Q46:5 in ca1).

as being an exception by Sībawayh (iv, 135). It seems to be the case that these
words in Quranic Arabic were probably pronounced /ḥattā/, /ʕalā/ and /ladā/,
despite their spelling. The spelling withىfor these words should probably
be considered historical spellings, rather than reflecting the pronunciation of
Quranic Arabic (van Putten 2017a, 62).39
The most likely explanation for this exceptional spelling of /ā/ withىcan
probablybeexplainedthroughtheirrespectiveetymologies.Itseemslikelythat
in the history of Quranic Arabic these prepositions were *ʔilay, *ʕalay, *laday,
and *ḥattay.40 When these would be combined with a noun starting with the
definite article, it would create a *aya triphthong which would then contract to
*ē and get subsequently shortened to a in a closed syllable, e.g. *ʕalay al-raǧuli
> *ʕalē l-raǧuli > ʕala l-raǧul. From this realization ʕala before definite articles,
one could easily get a preposition ʕalā through backformation.
A.2.6
Words Starting with /l/ Preceded by the Definite Article.
The definite article when it precedes a word that starts with,لis sometimes
written with only a single lām. This is regular forاليل
‘night’, and was probably
original forالولوا
‘thepearls’,which iswrittenwith only asingle lām intworather
early manuscripts (see B.6). All forms of the relative pronoun in the Quran are
spelled with a single lām, rather than the Classical Arabic practice which only
maintains this spelling for the singular and masculine plural forms, whereas all
other forms write it with two lāms (see A.4.5).
The vast majority of the words whose stem starts with lām however, are
written with two lāms, most notably, of course,الله
/aḷḷāh/. The fact that even
before the lām the definite article is usually spelled morphologically rather
than phonetically (unlike Nabataean Arabic) was one of the reasons for Van
Putten (2019b, 15) to suggest that the definite article was probably assimilated
in Quranic Arabic, as it is in Classical Arabic, and that at the very least it cannot
tell us that it was unassimilated as it is in the Damascus Psalm fragment.
A.2.7
Historical Hamzah Spelling withاى
Šayʔ ‘thing’, in early Quranic manuscripts, is written bothىشand, ىاشappar-
ently haphazardly but with a clear preference to spelling it with ʔalif. In the
39
Such spellings also occur in the early papyri (Hopkins 1984, §10d, only mentioningحتا
)
and Christian Arabic (Blau 1967, §10.1). Considering the special position of these prepo-
sitions in the reading traditions and the grammarians, the spelling of these prepositions
cannot be used as evidence that the vowel /ē/ and /ā/ have merged (pace Hopkins 1984,
§12c; Blau 2002, §16).

appendix a
Cairo editionلشاىis attested in Q18:23. There is no special significance to this
position in early manuscripts, where the spelling may occur elsewhere, and
some manuscripts spell itلشىin Q18:23 as well (e.g. sm1a).41 I side with Diem
(1980, §127–128) that this is likely a historical spelling. There are many cases
where an original *ʔ next to a *y or in a position where it would become a y is
spelled with the orthographic. ىاOther cases of this found in the Cairo edition
are:
الملايه/مالايهم
/al-malayi-h(um)/ ‘his/their chiefs’ (Q7:103; Q10:75, 83;
Q11:97; Q23:46; Q28:32; Q43:46)
جاى
/ǧīy/ ‘it was brought’ (Q39:69; Q89:23)
من نباى المرسلين
/min nabay(i) al-mursalīn/ ‘of the tidings of the messen-
gers’ (Q6:34)
افاين
/a-fa-(y)in/ ‘but if not …’ (Q3:144; Q21:34)
مايه، ماتين
/miyah, miyatayn/ ‘one/two hundred’ (Q2:259 (2×), 261; Q8:65
(2×), 66 (2×); Q18:25; Q24:2; Q37:147).
السواى
/as-sūwē/ ‘the evil’ (Q30:10)
يايس، تايسوا
/yayas, tayasū/ ‘he despairs/(do not) despair’ (Q12:87 (2×);
Q13:31).42
In early Quranic manuscripts, the verb‘ اشto want’ and‘ اجto come’ in the suffix
conjugation also occasionally employs this spelling:
شايت
‘you want’ (sm1a, Q18:77; T, Q24:62)شاىتم
‘you (pl.) want’ (Arabe 331,
Q2:223; dam 01–21.3, Q7:161).جايت
‘you came’ (T, Q19:27)
Several other examples have been identified by Puin (2011, 164).
سايل
/sīl/ ‘it was asked’ (Q2:108, in S, dam 01–28.1)
ساى
/sīy/ ‘he was distressed’ (Q11:77, in S)
41
The spellingشاىis also well-attested in the early Islamic Papyri (Hopkins 1984, §15d).
42
Diem(1980,§127)exploresthepossibilitythatthismightinfactrepresent/yāyas/,theout-
come of the metathesized root ʔayisa ‘to despair’ as attested in several modern dialects,
as well as in the Classical Arabic lexicons. He suggests this is not likely, as the perfect form
does not point to this metathesis. I tentatively follow this conclusion, although it could
be that yʔ > ʔy was a regular metathesis, which eventually gave rise to the perfect stem
being analogically remodeled towards ʔayisa. This other reading with metathesis is pos-
sible, and is in fact attested among the reading traditions, al-Bazzī ʕan Ibn Kaṯīr reads
istāyasū (Q12:80), tāyasū,yāyasu (Q12:87), istāyasa (Q12:110), yāyas (Q13:31), (Ibn al-Ǧazarī
§1528). The metathesized perfect form of this verb is attested in the early Islamic papyri
(Hopkins 1984, §56).

رايي
/rūyā-y/ ‘my vision’ (Q12:100 in cpp; W; sm1a; Q12:43 in W, sm1a, gk)
بايس
/bayyis/ ‘wretched’ (Q7:165 in A6140a43)
An apparent application of this same spelling practice is found in the spelling
of classical as-sayyiʔah. While this is spelledالسييهin the ce, occasionally in
early manuscripts we findالساييه
,with the etymological ʔalif seemingly before
the wrong consonant in terms of the seat of the hamzah.
Q7:95الساييه
/as-sayyiyah/ (cpp; bl)
A similar process is found on word-boundaries. Whenever a word is preceded
by bi- or li- and the consonant after the ʔalif is a yāʔ, a second yāʔ is writ-
ten. In the ce this only occurs three timesباييم
/bi-(y)āyyām/ ‘in the days
of …’ (Q14:5),باييد
/bi-(y)ayd/ ‘with strength’ (Q51:47),باييكم
/bi-(y)ayyi-kum/
‘which of you’ (Q68:6). But this practice is much more widespread in early
Quranic manuscripts than it is in the ce. The spelling is especially common
in the phraseباييت
‘with the signs/verses of …’ which is subjected to a rigor-
ous study by Déroche (2014, 47). Also, the singularباييه
‘with the sign/verse
of …’ is usually spelled in this manner. There are, at least, occasionally cases
where the same spelling is employed after the prefix li- (van Putten 2018,
111).
bi-ʔayyi is invariably spelled asبايىin early manuscripts, as can be easily seen
in the oft-repeatedفبايىin Q55 (see Arabe 331,W, sm1a,Top etc.). In other places
in the Quran, we likewise find the same spelling regularly:فبايى
(Q7:185; Q45:6;
Q53:55; Q77:50),بايى
(Q31:34; Q81:9) andلايى
(Q77:12).
Van Putten (2018, 109f.) suggested that these spellings are hybrid spellings
that represent both the original etymological ʔalif, but use the yāʔ to point out
that these forms were now pronounced as /bi-yāyāt/, /bi-yayyi/ etc. Some evi-
dence for this reading is furthermore found in the Quranic reading traditions.
Al-ʔaṣbahānī ʕan Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ is said to have pronounced every instance
of fa-bi-ʔayyi as [fabiyayyi], and there is some disagreement within his trans-
mission whether bi-ʔayyi-kum (Q68:6) and bi-ʔayyi (Q31:34) are read this way
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1492–1493). There is however no mention of Q81:9, nor li-ʔayyi
Q77:12, and nothing on bi-ʔāyāt, bi-ʔaydin or bi-ʔayyām.
While Van Putten (2018) does not comment on this, it is very striking that
whenever such a spelling takes place across word boundaries, it invariably
43
It is possible that the original readingof this word was rather /bāyis/, something bothبايس
and the more generally attestedبيسalso supports as a reading. There does not seem to
be a significantly difference in meaning between bāʔis and baʔīs.

involves a word that starts withاand hasىlater in the word. This is unlikely to
be a coincidence. Perhaps the loss of word-initial *ʔ did not undergo the same
developments as word-internal *ʔ (something suggested by other parts of its
orthographic behaviour as well) and a secondary sound-law takes place where
*ʔ > y /i_ā̆y. The rather specific context in which the sound law takes place,
however, is ad hoc and another solution may be thought of, but it seems that
any explanation must account for the fact that this spelling practice seems to
be conditioned by a y later in the word.44
A.2.8
The Spelling of dāwūd asدوادand ruʔūs asرواس
A rather puzzling spelling practice which may be related to the marking of
historical hamzah when it stands next to ū can be found in the name dāwūd.
In the ce this name is spelledداود
,but in early manuscripts it is frequently
spelledدواد
(Marx and Jocham 2015, 29ff.). It seems possible that this reversed
orderof theʔalif and wāwrepresentsanalternativepronunciationof thename:
/duwād/ or /duʔād/,45 similar to the appearance of the spellingابرهمandابرهيم
for ʔibrāhām and ʔibrāhīm (van Putten 2020b). Unlike the spellings ofابرهم,
ابرهيمnoclearpatternarisesof thetwospellingsbeingusedinfixedplacesacross
manuscripts. In general, manuscripts either have theدوادorداودspelling (see
B.17).
Such an explanation is less obvious for the representation of ruʔūs however.
It likewise occurs spelled asرواسهمin two manuscripts (Q14:43, Is. 1615 i, ca1).
Here we can hardly argue that the pronunciation was ruwās or ruʔās. It seems
then that, for whatever reason theواsequence may reflect a historical sequence
*ʔū,withtheetymologicalpositionof the*ʔtransposed,perhapsbecauseitwas
no longer pronounced, much like what we saw with the historical spellingاى
for words that involved yāʔ, where the ʔalif also often does not stand in the
right place, e.g.جاى
* <ǧīʔa. If this is also the case forداود
,the spelling may
still represent /dāwūd/, which would then have come from an earlier *dāʔūd.46
Note however, other manuscripts occasionally attest an etymological hamzah
spelling for words with similar syllable structure, where the ʔalif does stand in
44
This spelling convention on word-boundaries is not reported on for non-Quranic early
Islamic Arabic, but it is at least found on the Dome of the Rock inscription which spells
asباييات
(dotted as such!) (Kessler 1970, 6).
45
Cf. the Muʕtazilī ʔaḥmad b. ʔabī Duʔād (d. 240ah), see ei2: s.v. Aḥmad b. Abī Duʾād. Of
course, we may also entertain the idea that this is a later spelling pronunciation and in
fact Ibn ʔabī Dāʔūd was intended.
46
Which in turn could, in fact, come from *dāwūd again, due to the presence of a shift of
*wu and wū to ʔu/ʔū well-attested in Classical Arabic, and also found in the qct once (see
A.3.11).

the etymologically correct position, e.g.براوسكم
(Q5:6, ms.or.fol. 4313), likewise
yaʔūsan is spelled with a historical spellingياوسا
(Q17:83, Or. 2165) (see B.18).
A.2.9
Plene Spelling of Short u
Occasionally, the Quran attests examples where what was likely short u is
spelled with a.وThis is well attested in forms of the plural demonstrative ele-
ment *ʔul- such asاوليك
/ulāyik/ ‘those’,اولا
/ulāʔ/ ‘those’;اولوا
/ulū/ ‘those of
(masculine, nominative)’;اولى
/ulī/ ‘those of (masculine, genitive/accusative)’;
اولات
/ulāt/ ‘those of (feminine)’. For words of this type, this spelling practice
continues to be the regular spelling all throughout the written history of Ara-
bic.47 As it is unusual to find short vowels being spelled with a long vowel sign
in the qct, as this is not at all the norm, one might consider the possibility that
these forms in Quranic Arabic originally had long vowels, as per their spelling.
This option appears to be supported by Rabin (1951,153), who however does not
comment on it explicitly and also says that Classical Arabic has ʔūlāʔi, which
to my knowledge only occurs with a short vowel (Fischer 2002, §7, n. 7). How-
ever, the short vowel is in better agreement with the cognates of this plural
morpheme in other Semitic languages, which all universally point to a short
vowel.The spelling of short u withوis attested once in a context other than the
plural pronoun base ʔul-, namely,ساوريكم
/sa-urī-kum/ ‘I will show you’ (Q7:145;
Q21:37).
A.2.10 Defective Spelling of Word-Final Long Vowels before ʔalif al-waṣl
While long vowels before ʔalif al-waṣl are generally spelled plene, it appears
that these long vowels were shortened, at least, before the ʔalif al-waṣl of the
definite article, and this shortening is on occasion expressed in the orthogra-
phy, as pointed out by Nöldeke et al. (2013, 409).
The vocative ʔayyuhā is usually spelledايهاin the qct, but a spellingايهocca-
sionally occurs. In all cases this happens in front of a noun with the definite
article,ايه المومنون
‘O believers’ (Q24:31),يايه الساحر
‘O sorcerer!’ (Q43:49) andايه
الثقلان
‘O two dependents’ (Q55:31).48To my knowledge no other cases of defec-
tive final ā.
For defective ū we find:يدع الانسان
‘man supplicates’ (Q17:11),ويمح الله
‘and
God eliminates’ (Q42:24),يدع الداع
‘the caller calls’ (Q54:6),سندع الزبانيه
‘we will
call the angels of Hell’ (Q96:18),صلح المومنين
‘the righteous ones of the believers’
(Q66:4).
47
Puin (2011, 150) identified several early Quranic manuscripts where words of this type are
occasionally spelled without the,وe.g.كيلاف
/fa-ulāyik/,/ ىلاulī/.
48
Cf. early Christian Arabic with the same practice (Blau 1967, §9.2).

Most common, however, is the shortening of ī before ʔalif al-waṣl:سوف
يوت الله
‘God will bring’ (Q4:146),ننج المومنين
‘we save the believers’ (Q10:103),
بالواد المقدس
‘in the sacred valley’ (Q20:12; Q79:16),لهاد الذين
‘verily a guide of
those who’ (Q22:54),واد النمل
‘the valley of ants’ (Q27:18),اتين الله
‘God has given
me’ (Q27:36),49شطى الواد الايمن
‘the rightmost side of the valley’ (Q28:30),العمى
‘ دهٮguide of the blind’ (Q30:53),50نمحرلا ندري
‘The beneficent intends for me’
(Q36:23),صال الجحيم
‘the burning one in hell’ (Q37:163),يعباد الذين
‘O my slaves who
…’ (Q39:10),الجوار المنشيت
‘the elevated ships’ (Q55:24),51الجوار الـكنس
‘running,
disappearing’ (Q81:16).
A special case isيقص الحق
(Q6:57) which is variously read as yaqḍil-ḥaqq and
yaquṣṣu l-ḥaqq (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3029). Only in the former option are we deal-
ing with the shortening of ī before ʔalif al-waṣl. However, I agree with Sadeghi
(2013) that the second reading is probably original.

The ˭ sign, which usually marks ‘unaspirated’ is here to be understood as
the glottis standing in prephonation state, i.e. a somewhat closed glottis which
stops strong turbulent airflow (which leads to aspiration in stops and “voice-
lessness” in fricatives). For the stops this auditorily presents itself as unaspi-
rated stops, and for the ṣwhich is likewise maǧhūr, as a fricative without tur-
bulent airflow (van Putten 2019b, 7–12).

The Loss of the Hamzah
As has long been recognized, the orthography of the Quran seems to reflect
a dialect that has lost the hamzah in most environments. In an earlier arti-
cle, I have shown that rhyme confirms that this is not purely an orthographic
idiosyncrasy, but is an accurate reflection of how the Quran was pronounced
(van Putten 2018).52 The table below illustrates the main phonological devel-
opments caused by the loss of hamzah, along with examples.

Vowels
As for the vowel system of Quranic Arabic, it shares with Classical Arabic the
short vowel system a, i, u and likewise shares the long vowels ā, ī and ū. How-
ever,theClassicalArabicācorrespondstoā,ēandō.Thetablebelowrepresents

Besides the Classical Arabic long vowels /ā/, /ī/ and /ū/, Quranic Arabic had a
fourth phonemic vowel which was written with a yāʔ and likely pronounced
as /ē/, e.g.هدى
/hadē/ ‘he guided’ (passim). It is clear from the rhyme that
this was a separate sound from final /ā/ written with ʔalif, §5.8, as they do not
cross-rhyme. This fourth vowel /ē/ should not be seen as a variant of ā, which
its Arabic name ʔalif maqṣūrah bi-ṣūrat al-yāʔ ‘the shortened ʔalif with the
shape of the yāʔ’ might suggest, nor should its pronunciation ʔimālat al-ʔalif
54
Thisis the readingof IbnŠihābal-Zuhrī(IbnXālawayhmuxtaṣar,47). Some other possible
interpretations of this rasm, e.g. /bayyis/ seems possible too. For a discussion see A.2.2.

naḥw al-yāʔ ‘The leaning of ā in the direction of ī’ be understood as a historical
process, which was not the concern of the Arab grammarians. Instead, these
are purely descriptive terms. Van Putten (2017a) has shown that not only is the
ʔalif maqṣūrah bi-ṣūrat al-yāʔ in the Quran pronounced differently, it also has
a different historical background from the ʔalif maqṣūrah bi-ṣūrat al-ʔalif and

Verbs with final /ē/ in early Quranic manuscripts, dissimilate to /ā/, written as
اـor defectively when the pronominal suffix -nī/-ni follows (ىنـor.) نـThis same
development happens when the 1sg. suffix -ya () ىـfollows a noun that ends in
/ē/. Van Putten (forthcoming) has argued that, since this spelling difference is
phonetically conditioned, we are likely dealing with a regular dissimilation of
ē to ā in the vicinity of ī or y. This difference in spelling has mostly been lost
in the ce, where these verbs and nouns are treated exactly the same before the

The Cairo Editions contain a few exceptions to this orthographic practice. For example,
iǧtabā-hu (Q16:121) is spelledاجتبه
;Early Quranic manuscripts, however consistently spell
thisاجتبيه
(e.g. B, W, bl, sm). The same is true for the same word in Q68:50 (e.g. W, sm).
Likewise, ʕuqbā-hā (Q91:15) spelledعقبهاin the Cairo Edition, is simply found asعقبيهاin
early manuscripts (e.g. sm, G) (see B.27). However, whileمضى
/maḍē/ ‘departed’ (Q43:8)
has the expected spelling in the ce, early Quranic manuscripts surprisingly seem to con-
verge on the spellingمضا
(see B.28).

1sg. suffixes as before any of the other pronominal suffixes. For a full overview
see Van Putten (forthcoming) but, one finds for example Q7:143:ترانى

A small group of nouns in Quranic Arabic are written with a final. هوـThese
areصلوه
‘prayer’ (passim),زكوه
‘alms’ (passim),حيوه
‘life’ (passim),منوه
‘Manāt’
(Q53:20),بالغدوه
‘in the morning’ (Q6:52; Q18:28);النجوه
‘the salvation’ (Q40:41)
andكمشكوه
‘likeaniche’(Q24:35).Whilethesewordsareoftenexplainedasrep-
resenting an orthographic innovative way of writing word-internal /ā/, based
on Aramaic spellings of some of these words, Al-Jallad (2017c) shows that this
explanation is not very convincing. It is clear that all the words of Arabic origin
in this list originally had a sequence *awat which monophthongized to /-ōh/
(see also §5.3).
Another word that may have had the phoneme /ō/ isالربوا
/ar-ribō/ ‘usury’
(Q2:275 (3×), 276, 278; Q3:130; Q4:161). The spelling with wāw ʔalif while in
Classical Arabic ending up as ā, similar to the /ō/ of /ṣalōh/ becoming ṣalāh,
ṣalāt may suggest that this word was /ar-ribō/. The etymology of this word
is rather unclear (Rabin 1951, 109, §v), and current accounts of the phoneme
/ō/ do not predict native words to have /ō/ in word-final position (Al-Jallad
2017c; van Putten 2017a). There is also no forthcoming explanation why the
indefinite form of this noun apparently shifts this /ō/ to /ā/, as it is spelled
ربا
(Q30:39). Some nouns that etymologically end in a stem *-āʔ may have
shifted to *-āʔu to /ō/ in the nominative, as is discussed in more detail in
A.4.11.
A.3.4
Loss of Final Short Vowels and tanwīn
From the internal rhyme found in the Quran, it seems clear that what are
considered the pausal pronunciations of final short vowels and tanwīn are in
fact also the pronunciation in verse internal position as well (van Putten and
Stokes 2018). Hence the developments that have taken place are the follow-
ing, *u, *i, *a, *un and *in are lost word-finally, whereas *an has shifted to ā.
Case and mood vowels appear to have been retained in construct, however.
This reconstruction seems to be further confirmed by the Quranic orthography
which indeed lacks any sign of regular tanwīn that we would have otherwise
expected.
While throughout most of the corpus the generalization of this reduced
case/mood system is borne out, there are a couple of Sūrahs that appear
to tell a different story, at least in pausal position. In several final short *-a
appears to have been lengthened. In some cases, this appears in the qct, and
is further confirmed by the rhyme, e.g.:الظنونا
/aẓ-ẓunūnā/ ‘the assumptions’
(Q33:10),الرسولا
/ar-rasūlā/ ‘the messenger’ (Q33:66) andالسبيلا
/as-sabīlā/ ‘the

way’ (Q33:67). To this we may add as well the diptotic plural with an appar-
ent diptotic accusative ending:قواريرا
/qawārīrā/ ‘crystal clear’ (Q76:15, 16)56 and
سلسلا
/salāsilā/ ‘chains’ (Q76:4).
In other cases, the spelling is not changed, but the rhyme that such words
appear in make it clear that they are to be read with final /-ā/, thus every other
case of the accusativeof as-sabīl inrhymeis spelledالسبيلbutcertainly rhymed
/as-sabīlā/ (Q4:44, Q25:17, Q33:4). Likewise, two subjunctives seem to rhyme
with final /-ā/ان ازيد
/an azīdā/ ‘that I should add’ (Q74:15) andلن يحور
/lan
yaḥūrā/ ‘he will not return’ (Q84:14). Note that these are isolated exceptions,
and both the definite accusative and the subjunctive occurs hundreds of times
in rhyme where they are not pronounced as /-ā/. How to understand the excep-
tional status of these rhymes (which mostly concentrate and Q33 and Q76)
requires further research.57
A.3.5
Assimilation Across Vowels
A major feature of Quranic Arabic that distinguishes it quite clearly from later
Classical norms is its assimilation of identical and coronal consonants across
vowels, while some of these ambiguous cases lead to disagreement between
the Quranic readers, there is not a single reading that shows no signs of this
assimilation at all.
For assimilation across vowels where the consonants are identical, it mostly
concers with the first-person clitics -nī and -nā. The table below illustrates the
examples. In some of these cases there is a disagreement between the regional
codices, where one of the codices has an unassimilated form where the other
does, in such casesIhavegiventheabbreviatedcode(S= Syria,M= Medina,B=
Basra, K = Kufa, C = Mecca) of the regional codex that has the minority variant.
The unmarked version is then the variant that occurs in all other codices (see
Sidky 2021; Cook 2004).

The form in Q76:16 does not occur in rhyme, but is the first word of the verse, directly fol-
lowingthepreviouswordspelledlikethis.Thisbeingsaid,thelaterBasrancodicesseemto

.For a discussion on the reports on this spelling
and its attestations in early manuscripts see Sidky (2021).

One might be tempted to understand such assimilation taking place as evi-
dence that in Quranic Arabic the intervening short vowels of these stems
had been lost, even before clitics. Interpreted in this way, these would not be
examples of assimilation across short vowels. For early Christian Arabic, which
shows similar cases, e.g.اخزنى
/ʔaxzan-nī/ ‘he grieved me’,امكنى
/ʔamkan-nī/ ‘it
was possible for me’,يدينى
/yadīn-nī/ ‘you judge me’. Blau (1967, §35.4; §41.4)
indeed interprets these as evidence for that.
It is worth making several more observations here however: even when the
previous consonant is completely unvocalized in the reading traditions, iden-
tical consonants following each other may be written twice, thus the jussive

two kāfs,يوجهه
(Q16:76) recited as yuwaǧǧih-hu andيكرههن
(Q24:33) recited
as yukrih-hunna are written with two hāʔs. But assimilation written out may
also happen as found in the jussiveتفتنى
(Q9:49) recited as taftin-nī. As such,
the fact that e.g.يدعوننى
(Q12:33) ‘they call me’ is written with two nūns does
not necessarily prove the pronunciation /yadʕūna-nī/, it could just as well
stand for /yadʕūn-nī/ with morphophonological spelling. However, in light of
the fact that nouns followed by pronominal clitics appear to have kept their
final short vowels (A.3.4), it seems reasonable to assume that this is the case
for verbs too. The examples given above are therefore not evidence for the
lack of final short vowels, but rather examples of assimilation across vowels,
a phenomenon of which there are many more examples in Quranic Arabic
where we cannot propose the absence of an intervening vowel as we will see
below.
Assimilation of identical consonants across a vowel also rarely occurs in the
jussives of geminated verbs like yamdud. These forms are far outnumbered by
cases where the metathesis did not take place, but it is worth mentioning all
the cases here. If the same word also occurs elsewhere unassimilated, I have
included them in this table as well. When regional variants play a role letter
codes are given once again.

For the prefix conjugation there are many more examples, but are cause for
some disagreement between the readers.When a ya- prefix precedes an assim-
ilated tD/tL-stem, all readers are in agreement that the prefix assimilates, but
when it stands before a ta- prefix, some rather see it as the haplological avoid-
ance of the sequence ta-ta- > ta-, similar toولا تفرقو
/wa-lā tafarraqū/ ‘do not
become disunited’ (Q3:103) butولا تتفرقوا
/wa-lā tatafarraqū/ ‘id.’ (Q42:13). As
both haplology avoidance and assimilation occur in the qct, it is not possible
to be certain in those cases whether we are dealing with assimilation or hap-
lology. The table below gives several illustrative examples of the problem using
the common verb taḏakkara as the basis for examples.

As was the case with the assimilation of identical consonants across vowels,
this type of assimilation is also cause for some disagreement between the
regional codices, for Q7:3 the Syrian codex hasٮتذكرونrecited by Ibn ʕāmir as
yataḏakkarūna whereas the non-Syrian codices haveتذكرونvariously recited as
taḏakkarūna or taḏḏakkarūna. In light of the non-Syrian reading, the more nat-
ural reading of Q7:3 in the Syrian codex is probably tataḏakkarūna, a reading
that is indeed reported for Ibn ʕāmir (as a non-canonical transmission) and for
ʔabū al-Dardāʔ (Ibn Xālawayh muxtaṣar, 42; Ibn Muǧāhid, 278). ʔabū al-Dardāʔ
was one of the companions of the prophet who indeed died in Damascus, and
was one of Ibn ʕāmir’s teachers (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §627), it is therefore no surprise
that he would have the expected Syrian variant.
The assimilation across vowels of ta- to a following coronal may even hap-
pen if the ta- is preceded by a consonant. This seems to occur in the Ct-stem
istaṭāʕa ‘to be able’, but may, depending on the interpretation, also occur with
the Gt-stems ihtadā and ixtaṣama, for a discussion on the interpretation of the
Gt cases see §5.10. The table below illustrates some examples.

These examples should make it clear that syncope of short vowels between
two identical consonants, and assimilation of t to coronals across a vowel hap-
pens quite frequently all throughout the qct. It seems to have always been
optional, and for almost every single example of such a phenomenon there
are examples where the assimilation did not take place as well. Its distribu-
tion does not present an obvious explanation for this variation. The fact that
bothلم تستطعandلم تسطعoccur only several verses apart, andاستطاعواandاسطاعوا
even occur in the same verse, give us little reason to suggest that this is due to
multiple authors or scribes for different parts of the Quran. It seems that we
must conclude that such assimilations across vowels were a free variant option
in the language of the Quran, which infrequently occurred regardless of envi-
ronment.
The freedom between different assimilated and unassimilated forms is in
fact so close, that almost perfectly parallel verses may occur both with assimi-
lated and unassimilated forms, for example:

And we sent no prophet unto any town except to visit its people with
tribulation and adversity, so that perhaps they might grow humble.
Another case of this process is attested in the non-canonical readings, and
is well-attested in vocalized Quranic manuscripts for the verbيخصفان
(Q7:22;
Q20:121) ‘they covered (themselves)’, which is read by the canonical readers as
yaxṣifāni but is attested vocalized as yaxaṣṣifāni, yaxiṣṣifāni in kufic manus-
cripts (e.g. Q7:22 in Arabe 334j; Q20:121 in Arab 325j, 347a), which is clearly an
assimilated form of the Gt-stem yaxtaṣifāni. These forms are attested in the
Šāḏḏliterature too, e.g. Ibn Xālawayh (muxtaṣar, 42, 90).
A.3.6
Pausal Shortening of -ī
Quranic Arabic has two realizations of word-final -ī, it can either be written
with aـىor with no mater at all. This concerns any type of word-final yāʔ:
(1) Final -ī of definite iii-y nouns, e.g.الواد
‘the valley’ (Q89:9); (2) 1sg. Object
pronoun -nī, e.g.فاتقون
‘fear me’ (Q2:41); (3) 1sg. possessive pronoun -ī, e.g.دين
‘my religion’ (Q109:6); (4) The -ī of imperfect verbs (only once):‘ رسيit passes’
(Q89:4).
Van Putten & Stokes (2018, 156–158) showed that these shortened forms are
overwhelmingly favoured in pausal positions. While long forms rarely occur
in pause, and shortened forms only occasionally occur outside of pause. Thus,
pause seems to be quite clearly the origin for the shortening.The fact that these
forms stand in rhyme where the vowel is entirely unpronounced, suggests that
the-ī wasnotshortened,butdroppedaltogether,whichwouldmeanthepausal
form of the 1sg. possessive marker was zero-marked.

spelling is not always regular. It is outside the scope of the current work to
examine this spelling in every single manuscript. Instead, below I have listed
the spellings for every single occurrence of the word in the cpp. It becomes
clear that the spellingسييت
,more in line with the normal orthographic prac-
tices of the qct, occurs besidesسيات
.
سياتنا

(Q10:27)

سييتكم
(Q4:31; Q5:12; Q8:29),سييته
(Q65:5)
As with most other CayyiC adjectives, sayyiʔ has a contracted by-form sayʔ in
ClassicalArabic(Lane,1491a,seealsoal-Farrāʔ Luġāt,30),cf.ḍayyiq-,ḍayq-‘nar-
row’ (Lane, 1868b), mayyit-, mayt- ‘dead’ (Lane, 2800b) and layyin-, layn- ‘soft’
(Lisān, 4117b). It seems then that the spellingسياتshould be considered the
outcome of this contracted form, i.e. /sayyāt/ or /sayāt/, whereas the spelling
سييتrepresents the uncontracted form /sayyiyāt/. The ʔalif then is not a sign
for the hamzah, but rather the result of the regular rule for the plene spelling of
the plural feminine ending which occurs if the word would otherwise consist
of only three letters (see Appendix A.2.1).
Whether the qct indeed originally showed free variation between the con-
tracted or uncontracted form, or whether the ce is correct in only showing the
contracted form is a question that cannot be addressed in the current work.
A.3.8
A Case of N-Assimilation?
While by no means regular, there are two examples in the qct where the
sequence of two nūns is simplified to just a single nūn, namely: Q21:88نجى
‘we save’, Q12:110فنجى
‘so we save’ (cf. Q10:103‘ جننwe save’) which are read as
nuǧǧī/nunǧī and fa-nuǧǧiya/ fa-nunǧī respectively.73If thisisnotsimplyawrit-
ing error that has been propagated from the archetype, this should probably be
understood as an isolated case of an assimilated n to the following ǧ.

Ibn al-Ǧazarī (§3354; §3633), who considered Q21:88 a hapological reduction of nunaǧǧī.
Ibn Muǧāhid (430), surprisingly considers it to be the passive perfect nuǧǧiya with
dropped final -a. This is grammatically quite problematic considering the following noun
al-muʔminīna is in the accusative.

tive, normatively it is to be pronounced as -iyy even in pausal pronunciation.
The Quranic rhyme suggests that the simplification of -iyy to -ī took place in
Quranic Arabic as well, whereas the indefinite accusative remained -iyyā.

The feminine gentilic adjective ending would presumably have been /-iyyah/,
but it is unattested in rhyme position.
A.3.10 ʔalif al-waṣl
In Classical Arabic,thereisa significant groupof wordsthat start with aninitial
vowel, which is elided when another vowel precedes it.74 These can be found
in five main environments.
1.
The definite article: (a)l-bašar
2.
A small group of nouns such as (i)sm ‘name’, (i)bn ‘son’, (i)mruʔ ‘man’,
(i)mraʔah ‘woman’.
3.
Imperative verbs, (i)fʕal, (u)ktub
4.
Gt-, N- and Ct-stem verbs: (i)ftaʕala, (i)nfaʕala, (i)stafʕala
5.
Assimilated tD- and tL-verbs: (i)ḏḏakara, (i)ṯṯāqala
From the qct, it is not at all clear that such an elision takes place in Quranic
Arabic, as the protheticvowelisspelled morphophonologically,so evenwhena
particle precedes that would cause the ʔalif al-waṣl to be elided, is still written.
From the orthography it is therefore equally possible that the ʔalif was actually
pronounced in such cases.
From the Damascus Psalm fragment, we learn that it need not be the case
that all contexts of the ʔalif al-waṣl are equal in this regard. There the ʔalif al-
waṣl of the definite article is elided in much the same way as in Classical Arabic
e.g. οελναρ /wa-l-nār/ ‘and the fire’ (v. 21), βιλλαυ /bi-ḷḷāh/ (v. 22), φιλ•β[…] /fi l-
b[ariyyah]/ ‘in the wilderness’ (v. 52), φιλ•βαχερ /fi l-bašar/ ‘among men’ (v. 60),
λιλ•σεβ• /li-l-sab(y)/ ‘into captivity’. However, the Gt- and N-stems seem to have
a true hamzat al-qaṭʕ, e.g. οα•αβ•τε•λεῦ/wa-ʔabtalaw/ ‘they tempted’ (v. 56) and
φα•ανκα•λε•β(ο)υ• /fa-ʔanqalabū/ ‘and they turned their backs’ (v. 57) (for the
analysisof theDamascusPsalmFragmentseeAl-Jallad2020b,79ff.).Asalready
74
In poetry, the ʔalif al-waṣl may sometimes be treated as a true hamzah (Nöldeke 1896, 7).

appendix a
pointed out by Al-Jallad (2020b, 51, 60), it is therefore not a given that the
qct orthography represented a linguistic situation identical to Classical Arabic
rather than the situation identical to that of the Damascus Psalm Fragment. In
this section we will examine each of the five environments, and considered the
evidence for the elision of the ʔalif al-waṣl in each of them.
In the qct, it is regular to drop the ʔalif al-waṣl of the definite article when
la- or li- precedes, e.g.الحمد لله
/al-ḥamd li-llāh/ ‘praise be to God’ (Q1:2),هدى
للمتقين
/hudē li-l-muttaqīn/ ‘a guidance to the god fearing’ (Q2:2),وانه للحق من ربك
/wa-inna-h la-l-ḥaqq min rabbi-k/ ‘for this is indeed the truth from your lord’
(Q2:149). In early manuscripts this behaviour is quite frequent, although never
regular, when bi- precedes the definite article.This is especially common in the
phraseبالحق
/bi-l-ḥaqq/ ‘with the truth’ (Cellard 2018, 8), although not exclu-
sively, e.g.بلمعروڢ
/bi-l-maʕrūf/ ‘what is fair’ (Cellard 2018,٧٤-,٨٤l. 5),سمالب
/bi-l-ams/ ‘yesterday’ (Cellard 2018,٧٧-,٨٧l. 6). Very rarely the preposition ka-
has the same effect, e.g.كلمهل
/ka-l-muhl/ ‘like molten brass’ (Cellard 2018,٩٩١-
,٠٠٢l. 10). If wa- or fa- or fī precede, the ʔalif al-waṣl is always written.
The only possible example that may be cited of an example where the ʔalif
al-waṣl of the definite article is perhaps left unwritten is the phraseولدار الاخره
(Q12:109; Q16:30).This is recited as a construct phrase as wa-la-dārul-(ʔ)āxirati,
howeverوللدار الاخره
(Q6:32), recited as wa-la-d-dāru l-(ʔ)āxiratu,75 suggests
that this might not be a construct phrase with the asseverative particle la- in
frontof it,butratherthesinglelāmrepresentsthedefinitearticle,i.e./wa-d-dār
al-āxirah/ (Nöldeke et al. 2013, 397, fn. 56).
Despite the frequent morphophonological spelling then, it seems clear that
indeed the vowel of the definite article was elided if a particle preceded. This
is further confirmed by the fact that, occasionally, word-final long vowels are
spelled defectively when they immediately precede a definite article, e.g.سوف
يوت الله المومنين اجرا عظيما
/sawf yūti (< yūtī) llāh al-mūminīn aǧrā ʕaẓīmā/ ‘Allah
will bring the believers a great reward’ (Q4:146),صلح المومنين
/ṣāliḥu (< ṣāliḥū) l-
mūminīn/ ‘the righteous among the believers’ (Q66:4) andايه اللذين امنوا
/ayyuha
(< ayyuhā) l-mūminūn/ ‘O believers!’ (Q24:31) (see A.2.10).
There is very little direct evidence that the ʔalif al-waṣl on words such as
imraʔah and imruʔ was elided. However, the basmalah formula is writtenبسم
الله
/bi-smi llāh/ and neverباسم الله
.This is a strong indication of the elision of
this ʔalif al-waṣl. Outside of the basmalah, bi-smi occurs occasionally with the
morphophonological spelling as well, though this is cause for some disagree-
75
ExceptbytheSyriancanonicalreaderIbnʕāmirwhoreadsitwa-la-dārul-ʔāxirati,because
the Syrian Muṣḥaf spells thisولدار الاخرهrather thanوللدار الاخره
(Ibn al-Ǧazarī §3017;
Cook 2004, 92, (S4)).

/bi-smirabbi-ka/(Q56:74)
(see B.19). The ce attestsيبنوم

which would be a good example of the elided ʔalif al-waṣl before, نباhowever
this word is consistently spelledيابنومin early Quranic manuscripts (see B.20).
While several I-ʔ verbs have irregular biradical imperatives such as kul ‘eat!’
and xuḏ‘take!’, most verbs are treated as regular triradical verbs, with the loss
of the hamzah in Quranic Arabic, however, these develop a special allomorphy,
where the unprefixed imperative have an initial long vowel /ī/ whereas when
theyareprefixedby wa-or fa-thesemergedinto/wā-/and/fā-/.Thisbehaviour
can only be understood if we assume that such imperatives in an early stage of

theClassicalpronunciation/liqāʔa-naʔti/orwithlossof hamzah/liqāʔanāti/76

behaviour clearly cannot be attributed to pausal spelling, as had that been the

with the yāʔ, i.e. **فايت
‘come/bring!’.77

As is the recitation of Warš ʕan Nāfiʕ, ʔabū Ǧaʕfar and optionally for ʔabū ʕamr.

This is thus one of the many examples where the alleged “pausal spelling principle” is vio-
lated in Quranic orthography. See Van Putten & Stokes (2018, 152–158) for a more detailed
discussion.

appendix a
Synchronically, it therefore seems that verbs of this type had a ʔalif al-qaṭʕ
when there was not a direct proclitic in front of it. It seems possible thatواغفر
‘and forgive!’ (Q2:285),وانظر
‘andsee!’ (Q2:259),واعلم
‘andknow!’(Q2:26)areread
as /wa-ġfir/, /wa-nẓur/ and /wa-ʕlam/ respectively, which would assume some
amount of morphophonological spelling (something that is clear for the def-
inite article as well) but alternatively /wa-iġfir/, /wa-unẓur/ and /wa-aʕlam/
cannot be excluded.The fact that, unlikethe definitearticle, weneverfind pho-
netic spellings without the prothetic ʔalif may be interpreted as an indication
that these indeed had ʔalif al-qaṭʕ.
When li- and la- precede the definite article, they always trigger an elided
spelling of the ʔalif al-waṣl. This is not the case when la- precedes the ʔalif al-
waṣl of derived verbs of the N-, Gt- or Ct-stem, which may suggest that, similar
to the Damascus psalm fragment, these derived verbs indeed had a prefix ʔa-
rather than ʔalif al-waṣl, e.g.لاختلفتم
/la-ʔaxtalaftum/ ‘you would have differed’
(Q8:42),لانفضوا
/la-ʔanqaḍḍū/ ‘they would have dispersed’ (Q3:159),لاستكثرت
/la-ʔastakṯart/ ‘I would have multiplied’ (Q7:188).
There is one case against the presence of an ʔalif al-qaṭʕ in the Gt-stem.
لتخذت
‘you would have taken’ (Q18:77) is recited as la-ttaxaḏtā, la-ttaxatta by
most readers, despite the absence of the ʔalif al-waṣl in the qct.The reading of
Ibn Kaṯīr, ʔabū ʕamr andYaʕqūb is la-taxiḏta,la-taxitta, which would not imply
the elision of the ʔalif al-waṣl (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §3525). However, it is quite clear
that this is the inferior reading. Ittaxaḏa is an irregular Gt-stem. Instead of the
expected **iʔtaxaḏa, Quranic Arabic treats it as a derivation of a I-w verb. The
G-stem taxiḏa is transparently an analogical backformation from ittaxaḏa. As
the G-stem of ittaxaḏa is just the original ʔaxaḏa everywhere else in the Quran,
e.g.اخذتهم
/ʔaxaḏtu-hum/ (Q22:44), it is difficult to accept the sudden use of
taxiḏa in this place only. Thus, the more natural reading ofلتخذتis indeed
/la-ttaxaḏt/, which suggests that the ʔalif al-waṣl was unpronounced, in line
with Classical Arabic, and different from the Arabic of the Damascus psalm
fragment. There is however a question whether the spellingلتخذتis in fact
archetypical to the ut. While a good number of manuscripts indeed exhibit
this spelling, several quite ancient manuscripts point to the expected spelling
لاتخذت
,such as Saray Medina 1a (corrected toلتخذتby a later hand) (see B.21).
If the spelling with the elided ʔalif al-waṣl is not original to the ut, then it once
again becomes quite likely that the initial cluster was preceded by an ʔalif al-
qaṭʕ instead.
Finally, the tD- and tL-stems as with the derive N-, Gt-and Ct-stems always
write the ʔalif al-waṣl with an ʔalif, regardless of whether it is preceded by a
proclitic or not. However,theonlyprocliticsthatoccurbeforeitare wa- (وازينت
/wa-(v)zzayyanat/ ‘and is embellished’, Q10:24) and fa- (فادرتم
/fa-(v)ddārātum/

‘so they disputed’, Q2:72). These same proclitics also do not cause the elision of
the ʔalif al-waṣl of the definite article in the orthography, which in proncunia-
tion it was almost certainly unpronounced. As such, it is not readily possible to
determine whether stems like these retained their epenthetic initial syllable if
a clitic precedes.
A.3.11
An Isolated Case of Word-Initial *wu > ʔu
The Arab grammarians record the possibility of shifting word-initial *wu and
*wū to ʔu and ʔū, e.g. wulida > ʔulida, and in wuǧūh > ʔuǧūh (Sībawayh iv,
331). This rule has made its way, not entirely regularly, into the textbook Clas-
sical Arabic as well (Fischer 2002, §36b). While most of the time, this shift
does not occur in the qct, e.g.ولد
(Q19:15) /wulid/ ‘he was born’ andوجوه
(Q3:106) /wuǧūh/ ‘faces’, there is a single occurrence of this development,
namely,اقتت

appendix a
From the fact that the masculine plurals are spelledهمandانتمrather than
همواandانتمواmake it obvious that Quranic Arabic did not employ the long forms
of the plural pronouns, unlike some of the Hijazi reading traditions (§3.6.5).
The reconstruction of the phonetics of the third person singular pronouns
requires some discussion. In the ʕarabiyyah these pronouns are consistently
huwa and hiya, unless they stand in an environment where they may syncopate
to wa-hwa and fa-hya (§2.2.4.3). From a Semitic perspective, the ʕarabiyyah
forms are surprising, the Hebrew forms hūהואand hīהיאare best understood
as reflexes of Proto-West-Semitic *hūʔa and *hīʔa (Suchard 2019, 211). Both the
loss of length and the loss of the *ʔ in the ʕarabiyyah are irregular. Many mod-
ern dialects of Arabic have forms such as huwwa and huwwe (besides hū, hī)
(Fischer and Jastrow 1980, 80) which do not appear to be reflexes of *huwa and
*hiya but rather of *hūʔa-h and *hīʔa-h, i.e. the Proto-West-Semitic pronouns
followed by the -h pronominal extension also found in the Hebrew second per-
son masculine pronoun ʔattå < *ʔanta-h, and in the third person pronouns as
well in the dead sea scrollsהיאה ,הואה
(Suchard 2019, 210). For a discussion on
these stem extensions see Al-Jallad (2014b).
The expected reflex of Classical Arabic *huwa in Quranic Arabic, after the
loss of final short vowels, would be **hū. As we saw in A.2.3, word-final -ū is
usually written with an ʔalif al-wiqāyah, and therefore the expected spelling
of our hypothetical **hū would be. اوهInstead, we regularly find, وهwhich
would be the expected spelling for the reflex of *hūʔa > huww. On this basis we
might want to posit the third person pronouns as *hūʔa > /huww/ and *hīʔa >
/hiyy/ for Quranic Arabic. However, the fact that the pausal formهيه
(Q101:10)
rhymes as /hiyah/, seems to suggest that Quranic Arabic indeed goes back to a
form closer to the one we find in Classical Arabic instead, which would make
a reading as /hū/ and /hī/ more attractive, in which case the spelling ofهوis
irregular.80
A.4.2
Clitic Pronouns
Thepronominalsystemof theQuranicreadingtraditionsshowsalargeamount
of variation,mostof whichisnotcontinuedinClassicalArabic(vanPuttenand
Sidky forthcoming). As final short vowels are lost in Quranic Arabic, some of
this variation present in the reading tradition was presumably not expressed
at all. It is unclear to what extent there was vowel harmony between the case
vowel and the following pronominal suffix in the masculine plural clitics, but
80
Al-Farrāʔ (Luġāt, 29) reports that Banū ʔasad uses hū and hī for huwa and hiya, and he
cites poetry using the hī form. Such monosyllabic forms of the independent pronouns
occur on occasion in poetry.

reportsof grammarianssuggestthatitwastypicalof theHijaztonothavevowel

harmony as well, although there is no independent way to confirm this.
Lengthened forms of the singular pronouns -hū and -hī were certainly
absent, as we would expect those to have been written asاوهـand. ىهـThe same
is true for the lengthened pronominal forms -humū, -himī, himū and -kumū
which would be expected to be writtenـهمى ,ـهمواandـكموا
.The long form of
the second person plural pronoun only occurs four times before other clitic
pronouns (Q8:44; Q11:28; Q15:22; Q47:37). The table below illustrates the prob-
able reconstruction of the pronominal suffix paradigm.

Special mention needs to be made of the 1sg. pronoun which has several dif-
ferent allomorphs. Due to pausal shortening of final *-ī both the verbal /-nī/
and nominal /-ī/ also occur as /-n/ and /-∅/ respectively (see A.3.6). After long
vowels, the 1sg. nominal suffix is /-y/. Finally, there likely was a special voca-
tive 1sg. marker that shows up in expressions of woe, e.g.ياسفى
/yā-ʔasaf-ē/ ‘O
my sorrow!’ (Q12:84),يحسرتى
/yā-ḥasrat-ē/ ‘O my regret!’ (Q39:56), andيوليتى
/yā-
waylat-ē/ ‘Woe is me!’ (Q5:31; Q11:72; Q25:28). While technically the spelling
withـىcould be read as -ī as well,81 the normal 1sg. ending, this is unlikely to be
the intended reading here. Vocatives throughout the Quran consistently have
the short pausal 1sg. ending, e.g.يقوم

/yā-abat-
81
Indeed, some non-canonical readers would read it as such, see Ibn Xālawayh (muxtaṣar,

the normal 1sg. ending, we would have expected it to have been shortened as
well. Moreover, in the canonical Quranic reading traditions this vocative 1sg. is
indeed consistently read as -ē/-ǟ/-ā, as expected (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §1973, §2041–
2042).
The first singular possessive clitic -ī occurs a few times in pausal position (all
in Q69) with a final h, clearly confirmed by the rhyme to represent a reading
/-iyah/:كتبيه
/kitāb-iyah/ ‘my book’ (Q69:19, 25);حسابيه
/ḥisāb-iyah/ ‘my reck-

/māl-iyah/ ‘my property’ (Q69:28)سلطنيه
/sulṭān-
iyah/ ‘my authority’ (Q69:29). Elsewhere in the Quran the pausal 1sg. /-∅/ is
used in verse final position.
A.4.3
Verbal Endings
The suffix conjugation of the perfective verb appears to have been identical
to the pausal pronunciations of Classical Arabic. The 1p suffix /-nā/ is always
spelled defectively in the qct when it is followed by a pronominal clitic. This
is presumably defective spelling, and does not indicate an actual shortening of
the suffix to /-na/ in that context.

as final root consonant such asجاو
/ǧāw/ ‘they came’ (e.g. Q3:184) and alsoراو
/rāw/ ‘they saw’ (e.g. Q7:149).83
The prefix conjugation has two different sets of ending, depending on
whether it represent the imperfective, or the subjunctive/jussive. Invariably
the imperfective form is longer, and those forms are given in between brack-
ets when necessary. The vowel of the prefix appears to have occurred in two
forms either with an a (used for the G-, tD-, tL-, Gt-, N- and Ct-stems) and u
(used for the D-, L- and C-stems). In Quranic Arabic there was no alternation
in the prefix vowel between a and i as reported for some eastern dialects (see
§4.7).

Demonstrative Pronouns
The near deixis demonstrative pronouns of Quranic Arabic have much less
variation than is reported for Classical Arabic. It is seemingly a Hijazi innova-
tion to always prefix the deictic pronouns with hā- (see §4.5), save for certain
specific archaic constructions, where traces of the ancient forms without ḏā
are retained (see below).

The plene spelling of this pronoun seems to be the common spelling in early Quranic
manuscripts (see B.29).

In Classical Arabic, the dual of the near deixis inflects for case, as a dual noun
would, i.e. nom. hāḏāni gen./acc. hāḏayni. There is no evidence that this is the
case in Quranic Arabic. The masculine dual occurs twice, once at Q22:19هذان
خصمان
/hāḏān xaṣmān/ ‘these are two enemies’, with nominative function, and
the other is the famous verse Q20:63ان هذن لاسحرن
/in(n) hāḏāni la-sāḥirān/
‘indeed, these are two magicians’, where it functions as an accusative, where
Classical Arabic would require hāḏāyni. However, as this is the only attestation
of the near deixis dual pronoun in an accusative position, there is no reason to
believe that this dual inflected for case.
The feminine dual is only attested in the gen./acc. and has the expected
formهاتين
.This could either mean that at an earlier stage of Quranic Arabic, it
did inflect for case and the masculine and feminine generalized different case
forms, or that Q20:63 really is an error.
The far deixis in Quranic Arabic is marked by the deictic pronominal base,
followed by a typically Hijazi element -l(i)- in the singular followed by the sec-
ond person pronoun suffix, which can agree with the addressee.

Whileذلكandتلكcan clearly be used in environments where the addressee is
plural, the other forms seem to always be explicitly used in addressee agree-
ment. Fischer (2002, §275.2) suggests that the addressee agreement in pre-
classical Arabic no longer holds. This may be true for the poetry where these
forms occur, but the system is evidently productive in the Quran.85
The locative deictics follow the same pattern as the pronominal deictics,
where the near deixis always has the prefix hā- and the far deixis always

The Arab grammarians report forms of the short demonstrative without prefix
hā- as a possible forms, this use of/ اذḏā/ has fallen out of use in Quranic Ara-
bic. In the qct it is only attested after the interrogatives/ نمman/ ‘who’ andام
/mā/ ‘what’. The long interrogative /man ḏā/ is only used in the cleft construc-
tionمن ذا الذى
/man ḏā allaḏī/ ‘who is it that …?’ (Q2:245, 255; Q3:160; Q33:17;
Q57:11).ماذا

tax from /mā/.87 The long deictic can also be combined with/ نمman/:اذه نما
الذى
/ʔam-man hāḏā allaḏī/ ‘or who is it that …?’ (Q67:20, 21).
Classical Arabic has a construction of independent pronouns followed by
the deictic elements with a presentative function. In such cases, the deictic
lacks the hā- prefix but it may stand in front of the independent pronoun e.g.
hā-ʔana ḏā ‘here I am!’, ʔanta ḏā ‘here you are’, hā-naḥnu ʔulāʔi ‘here we are!’
(Fischer2002,§279).QuranicArabicatteststhisconstructiontwice,bothtimes
with plural pronouns:هانتم اولا تحبنهم
/hā-antum ulāʔ tuḥibbūna-hum/ ‘Here you
are loving them’ (Q3:119)هم اولا على اثرى
/hum ulāʔ ʕalā aṯar-ī/ ‘Here they are on
my track’ (Q20:84).
Such constructions may also have the hā- prefix on the demonstrative after
the pronoun, and the hā prefix may also occur on both:انتم هولا تقتلون انفسكم
/antum hāwulāʔ taqtulūn anfusa-kum/ ‘Here you are killing one another’
(Q2:85);هانتم هولا حججتم فيما لـكم به علم
/hā-antum hāwulāʔ ḥāǧaǧtum fī-mā la-kum
bi-h ʕilm/ ‘Here you are, having argued about that of which you have knowl-
edge’ (Q3:66), see also Q4:109 and Q47:38.
86
This word is normally interpreted as a single word māḏā and written as such in typewrit-
ten Arabic. There is no way to distinguishما ذاfromماذاin handwritten Arabic, as a space
between unconnected letters is of the same size in between words as within it. In light of
من ذاabove, it seems best to interpret the form as /mā ḏā/ in Quranic Arabic. The ambi-
guity whether these phrases should be seen as one word or not seems to also underlie
the reports that the Muṣḥafs of Ibn Masʕūd would write man ḏā as a single wordمنذا
(Al-
Farrāʔ Maʕānī, iii, 132).

Sībawayh (ii, 416–419) specifically discusses constructions of this type.

While Classical Arabic allows for two forms of the feminine plural relative pro-
noun, the form besides allātī is normally allawātī. Such a form does not occur
in the Quran. Instead, a pronoun spelled variously in early manuscripts asالاى
or, ىلاpresumably /allāy/, is used, with no discernable difference in function.89

The Relative Possessive Demonstrative
The relative possessive demonstrative which created constructions like “those

a pronoun as rare as the feminine plural relative pronoun would be likely to spread to all
positions and become the dominant relative pronoun.

Short Compound Interrogatives with mā
Prepositional compounds with mā occur several times in the Quran in short
forms, where the interrogative is only written as a single mīm. All of these occur
besides the long form. Whether the lack of an ʔalif should be understood as
them ending in a short /ma/, or ending in /m/ cannot be deduced from the
qct, and is dependent on the relative chronology of these shortened forms in
Quranic Arabic. It is worth noting that these shortened forms predominantly
occur when the combination of preposition + mā is interrogative in function,
only Q86:5 appears to have a relative function with the short. مم

‘ مكhow much?’, which in Classical Arabic is invariably read as kam, may also be
consideredtheresultof thishistoricalshorteningof -māincompoundinterrog-
atives, with lexical specialization. Historically, it seems to derive from *ka-mah
literally ‘like what?’, as can be seen in Semitic comparanda such as Hebrew
kammå ‘how much?’ (with irregular gemination also found in låmmå ‘why?’)
and Aramaic kəmā, kammā ‘how much?’ (Brockelmann 1908, 326). The fact
that the form ends up as kam in the Classical language and not as kama might
be an indication that the shortened pronoun was indeed pronounced /-m/ in
Quranic Arabic, rather than /-ma/.
The semantic development of ka-mā ‘like what?’ →ka-ma ‘how much?’ also
finds a parallel in another interrogative with the same meaning, namely ka-
ʔayyin, likewise ‘like’ + ‘what?’, as attested in the Quran in the phraseكاين من
‘how much of!’ (Q3:146; Q12:105; Q22:45, 48; Q29:60; Q47:13; Q65:8), with fos-
silized nunation written out (see van Putten and Stokes 2018, 170). In Classical
Arabic ka-ʔayyin can even have the interrogative function of kam ‘how much?’
(Lane, 134a) rather than only serving as an expression wonder.

.The reasons for this are not entirely clear. For a rather speculative
account on this phenomenon see Puin (2011, 154). See also Sidky (2021) for a discussion
of this phenomenon, but also lacking a solution. A dedicated study of this orthographic
phenomenon is warranted.

The use of the plural pattern CaCāCiC for ‘keys’ is somewhat surprising. Strict Classical
Arabic grammar would require the plural of miftāḥto be mafātīḥ. The use of this pattern
for stems with a long vowel in the last syllable seems to be more common in early Islamic
Arabic papyri (Hopkins 1984, §87b). Generalization of CaCāCiC over CaCāCīC is also a

Final weak nouns whose stem ends in historical *-iy- such *wādiy- ‘valley, river’
have some amount of variation due to the appearance of shortened forms of
the stem-final -ī. The defective spelling of the definite form is especially com-
mon in pause, and seems to be the result of a process of pausal shortening of
final ī that we find throughout the Quran (see A.3.6).The short spellings in con-
struct are presumably simply context spellings of the shortening of the long
vowel before the CC cluster of the following definite article.

verse, which seems to confirm it exceptional status. Note that Ibn Xālawayh (muxtaṣar,
35) cites a non-canonical reading for this verse with the singular, which would be equally
acceptable to the rasm.

early manuscripts retain the spellingالمنشيت
(see B.22). This word is read by the
majority of the readers as a passive participle of ʔanšaʔa, i.e. munšaʔāt ‘(sails)
raised’, whereas Ḥamzah reads it as an active participle munšiʔāt ‘raising (its
sails)’ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4316). The rasm is only consistent with Ḥamzah’s read-
ing,pointingto/munšiyāt/.If themajorityreadingisindeedintended,itmeans
that the adjective munšaʔ has merged completely with iii-y adjectives, and
must be understood as coming from a paradigm m.sg. */munšē/ m.pl */mun-
šawn/; f.sg. */munšēh/ f.pl. /munšayāt/.
The noun which in Classical Arabic would be sayyiʔ is consistently spelled
السياin early Quranic manuscripts (van Putten 2018, 115). This is similar to verbs
ending in the same sequence:هياhayyiʔ (Q18:10) andيهياyuhayyiʔ (Q18:16). The
reasons for this are unknown. It is tempting to see this as a historical hamzah
spelling.
A.4.11
Nouns in *-āʔ in Construct
In the discussion of the ʔalif al-wiqāyah above, we already saw that nouns end-
ingin-āʔ intheconstructnominativesometimesarespellednotwithfinalʔalif,
as is the normal spelling, but rather with ʔalif+wāw (most notably with ǧazāʔ-
spelled asجزاو
)and one time as wāw+ʔalif,ابنوا
(see B.11 and B.14). Also, the gen-
itive is occasionally expressed with a glide yāʔ in construct. This seems to be
reconstructible for the following words in the ut:تلقٰى
‘the accord of’ (Q10:15),
اناى
‘the hours of’ (Q20:130) and perhaps alsايتاى
‘the giving of’ (Q16:90) (see
B.23).
When nouns of this type are followed by a pronominal clitic, they always
reflect the case vowel with wāw in the nominative and yāʔ in the genitive in the
ce. But this is a quirk of the ce, and examination of early Quranic manuscripts
reveals that both spellings with and without the glides are attested (van Put-
ten and Stokes 2018, 172–176). While previously, Van Putten & Stokes (2018, 159,
160f.) have interpreted this as evidence that case vowels in construct could
optionally be lost, I now believe that a more natural interpretation of this data
is to see this as related to the special status of this word-final hamzah after /ā/.
FromQuranicrhymeitisclearthatthehamzahwasretainedinthisposition,
thusالدعا
(Q3:38) clearly rhymes with other words that end in /āG/, which sug-
gests a pronunciation /ad-duʕāʔ/. Moreover,انشا
(Q56:35) stands in an /āGā/
rhyme, thus suggesting that the indefinite accusative was pronounced with
final /āʔ-ā/, i.e. /inšāʔā/.
Presumably those forms that lack the glides are cases where the stem-
final hamzah (spelled with the ʔalif ) was retained. While those that show a
glide have optional elision of the hamzah in this non-word-final position. The
paradigm of nouns of this type must therefore be something along these lines
as shown in the table below.

The noun ʔawliyāʔ ‘allies; protectors’ is of exceptional status. While it is a noun
that historically end in -āʔ, when the noun stands in construct the glide for
the case vowel never appears, not when it stands in construct with a noun, nor
when a pronominal suffix follows. This idiosyncrasy is not retained in the ce,
but can be reconstructed for the ut, see B.24 (see also Nöldeke et al. 2013, 422).
It thus seems that this noun has merged with nouns that end in -yā such asالدنيا
/ad-dunyā/ ‘world’ (passim),الحوايا
/al-ḥawāyā/ ‘intestines’ (Q6:146) andخطيكم
/xaṭāyā-kum/ ‘your sins’ (Q2:58).

A.4.12
Confusion between Subjunctive and Apocopate
There is one example in the qct where we find confusion between the sub-
junctive and the apocopate. The following verse uses an apocopate stem, in a
clearly subjunctive context:
رب لولا اخرتنى الى اجل قريب فاصدق واكن من الصلحين
(Q63:10)
/rabb-∅, lawlā axxarta-nī ilā ajal qarīb fa-aṣṣaddaq wa-akun min aṣ-ṣāli-
ḥīn/
My lord, if only youwoulddelayme for abrief termso Iwouldgivecharity
and be among the righteous93
A.4.13
Partial Merger of iii-ʔ Verbs and iii-y/w Verbs
In Classical Arabic grammar iii-w/y verbs and iii-ʔ are kept clearly distinct.
This is, as far as we can tell from the defective spelling, not the case in Quranic
Arabic, where we see a certain amount of merger of the two stem types. This
merger is certainly less complete than it is in the modern dialects, but never-
thelesswecandeducemergersfromtheqctthatdidnottakeplaceinClassical
Arabic.
G-stems of iii-ʔ verbs are still clearly distinct from iii-y and iii-w verbs,
e.g.قرات
/qarāt/ ‘you recited’ (Q16:98) vs.نجوت
/naǧawt/ ‘you fled’ (Q28:25)
andقضيت
/qaḍayt/ ‘you decided’ (Q4:65), and even in derived stems there are
clear examples where they are distinct, e.g.نبات
/nabbāt/, or /nabbaʔat/ ‘she
informed’ (Q66:3),نباتكما
/nabbātu-kumā/ ‘I informed you’ (Q12:37);اخطاتم
/axṭā-
tum/ ‘you have sinned’ (Q33:5);امتلات
/imtalāt/ ‘you filled’ (Q50:30).
In the imperfect stem and nominal derivations, however, these verbs merge
to a large extent throughout the whole paradigm. With the loss of the ʔ, word-
final iʔ yielded -ī, merging in most places with word-final -ī of final weak roots.
This can be clearly seen in some of the derived stems of final glottal stop roots
that in the imperfect plural forms as well as the participial plural forms have
merged with the iii-y/w verbs.
يستهزى
/yastahzī/ (Q2:15) < *yastahziʔu
مستهزون
/mustahzūn/ (Q2:14) < *mustahziʔūna
93
It is interesting to note here that, while most reading traditions simply follow the rasm
and read this word as an apocopate ʔakun, ʔabū ʕamr ignores the rasm and reads it as the
Classically normative ʔakūna (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §4401).

This merger has led tosome amount of disagreementwhether certain verbsare
iii-y or iii-ʔ among the canonical readers, see §6.5.5 for a discussion.
Words ending in *aʔūna are technically ambiguous in terms of their inter-
pretation, due to the tendency to not write double wāw sequences for repre-
senting /wū/ (see A.2.2). It however stands to reason that these would have
merged to /-awn/, e.g.
يطون
/yaṭawn/ (Q9:120) < *yaṭaʔūna
يقرون
/yaqrawn/ (Q10:94; Q17:71) < *yaqraʔūna
يدرون
/yadrawn/ (Q13:22; Q28:54) < *yadraʔūna
مبرون
/mubarraʔūn/ (Q24:26) < *mubarraʔūna
مرجون
/murǧawn/ (Q9:106) < *murǧaʔūna
In the ʕarabiyyah, the apocopate and imperative would be places where iii-ʔ
and iii-w/y verbs would remain distinct, even if one were to pronounce them
with the loss of hamzah.The imperative ofصلىṣallā ‘to bless’ would beصلṣalli
‘bless!’, whereas the imperative ofنبأnabbaʔa ‘to inform’ would beنبئnabbiʔ
which with dropping of the hamzah should yield nabbī.
In the qct we see that a merger between the two stem types is under way, no
doubt due to their complete merger in the imperfective and subjunctive stems.
The table below illustrates the examples of apocopates and imperatives of his-
torically iii-ʔ verbs and how they appear in the qct.

/anbī-hum/أَنْبِئْه ُم
One final verb could perhaps be added here, namelyننسها
(Q2:106), which is
either read nunsi-hā, an apocopateof ʔansā ‘to cause tobe forgotten’or nansaʔ-
hā from nasaʔa ‘to cause to be delayed’ (Ibn al-Ǧazarī, §2720). If the latter
reading is correct, this would be yet another hamzated apocopate that appears
to function as a final weak verb. But *aʔ usually does not show this merger, e.g.
لم ينبا
/lam yunabbā/ ‘he was not informed’ (Q53:36),اقرا
/iqrā/ ‘recite!’ (Q17:14;
Q96:1, 3). Semantically, nunsi-hā seems like a better fit in this verse:ما ننسخ من
ايه او ننسها نات بخـير منها او مثلها
“whatever we abrogate from a verse or cause it to be
forgotten we bring one better or equal to it.”, and thus I think it is better taken
as the regular outcome of a final weak verb.
Finally, the verb hayyaʔa ‘to make ready’ is consistently spelled with a final
ʔalif in early Quranic manuscripts: hayyiʔهيا
(Q18:10); yuhayyiʔيهيا
(Q18:16).
This spelling should be reconstructed for the Uthmanic archetype,but its inter-
pretation is not very clear, for a suggestion and other words with such spellings,
see Van Putten (2018, 115).
A.4.14
Pausal Imperatives/Apocopates of iii-y/w Verbs Iqtadih, yatasannah
iii-w/y apocopates and imperatives throughout the Quran are consistently
without any reflex of the final radical, thus we see, e.g.يرم
/yarmi/ ‘throws’
(Q4:112),يدع
/yadʕ(u)/ ‘invokes’ (Q23:117),يلق
/yalq(a)/ ‘meets’ (Q25:68);ايت
/īt(i)/ ‘come!’ (Q10:15),ادع
/udʕ(u)/ ‘invoke!’ (Q2:68).

This word is spelledنبيناin the ce, but in early Quranic manuscriptنبناis regular. See B.26
for an overview.

However, the only two times that an imperative and apocopate occur in
pause, these stems are suffixed with a final hāʔ:فبهديهم اقتده
/fa-bi-hudē-hum
iqtadih#/ “so follow after their guidance.” (Q6:90),96 which is followed by the
قلےpausal sign in the ce, which indicates an optional pause, with a prefer-
ence towards pausing.97 The other case is found inقل بل لبثت مايه عام فانظر الى
طعامك وشرابك لم يتسنه
/qāl bal labiṯt miyah ʕām fa-nẓur ilā ṭaʕāmi-k wa-šarābi-
k lam yatsannah#/ “He said: Nay, you have remained for a hundred years, look
at your food and your drink; it did not age.” (Q2:259), which is followed by the
صلےpausal sign in the ce, which indicates an optional pause, with a preference
towards continuing.98 Based on these two examples it seems that in Quranic
Arabic imperatives and apocopates received /h/ in pause.
It is worth noting that the fact that this hāʔ only shows up in pausal posi-
tion, is yet another piece of evidence that ‘pausal spelling’ is not a governing
principle in Quranic orthography. Had that been the case, all apocopates and
imperatives should have received a final h, not just the one that stand in a
pausal position.
A.4.15
Partial Merger of the I-ʔ and I-w Verbs in Derived Stems
Due to the loss of the hamzah (see §5.2) D- and L-stems of verbs with a ʔ as
their initial consonant merge with D- and L-stems of verbs with w as their ini-
tial consonant, e.g. *yuʔaxxiru-hum >يوخرهم
/yuwaxxiru-hum/ ‘he gives respite
to them’ (Q14:42); *yuʔāxiḏu >يواخذ
/yuwāxiḏ/‘he wouldpunish’(Q35:45). Such
verbs usually remain distinct in the perfect where you get forms like *ʔaxxara
>اخر
/ʔaxxar/ ‘left behind’ (Q75:13). The partial merger of these verb types is no
doubt the origin of the pseudocorrect use of hamzah in muʔṣadah for mūṣadah
(§6.4.2).
A more pervasive merged with I-w is found in the Gt-stem of the verb ʔax-
aḏa, which is treated as a I-w in the qct. This idiosyncrasy also finds its way
into Classical Arabic, e.g.اتخذ
/ittaxaḏ/ ‘he took’ (e.g. Q18:4). Other Gt stems of
common, but it is consistent with the reading of al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī ʔanbi-himī (Ibn Xāl-
awayh muxtaṣar, 4).
96
Ibn ʕāmir treats this final hāʔ as a pronoun, reading it iqtadi-hi or iqtadi-hī (Ibn al-Ǧazarī,
§2375). This reading is grammatically rather awkward. It is difficult to take it as a resump-
tive pronoun of the preceding object (bi-hudā-hum) since that object is marked with bi-,
thus we would expect iqtadibi-hī rather than iqtadi-hī̆. Ibn Muǧāhid (262) shared this sen-
timent and explicitly calls it a mistake (wa-hāḏā ġalaṭun) because this is a pausal hāʔ, not
a pronoun.

I-ʔ verbs continue to behave distinctly from I-w verbs, e.g.لا ياتل
/lā yātal/ ‘may
they not swear’ < *yaʔtali (Q24:22).
A.4.16 /yak/ besides /yakun/
The verbكان
/kān/ ‘to be’, has an anomalous form in the apocopate. Besides the
regular stem formـكنwhich is identical to that of Classical Arabic, quite often
we find the form. كـVan Putten & Stokes (2018, 168–170) argue that this is best
understoodastheregularoutcomeof thisverbinQuranicArabic.Asword-final
nunation and case vowels were lost, the word final *-un of *yakun would also
regularly be lost, yielding /yak/. The long form is then an analogically restored
version of the apocopate.
A.4.17
*raʔaya ‘to See’ and *naʔaya ‘to Be Distant’ asراandنا
The regular spelling of the verbs raʔā ‘to see’ and naʔā ‘to be distant’, both his-
torically final weak verbs with a medial hamzah, isراandناrespectively in the
qct.Their orthographic behaviour suggests that they have merged with hollow
roots with a final hamzah, e.g./ اجǧāʔ/,تاج
/ǧāt/جاو
/ǧāw/ ‘to come’, at least in
the 3rd person masculine singular and plural forms, hence we find spellingsرا
/rāʔ// وارrāw/.The spellingارoccurs twenty times in the Quran, and only Sūrat
al-Naǧm attests the form( ىارQ53:11, 18), which at least in the first verse seems
to be the use of a dialectal form /raʔē/ to accommodate the rhyme. The exact
interpretation of the unusual behaviour in this Sūrah, however, should not dis-
tract us from the fact that the regular Quranic form is, ارwhich is not likely to
have been a spelling for /raʔē/.
How exactlyراandناtook on the shapes that they have is not entirely obvi-
ous. One might imagine that at an earlier stage of Quranic Arabic, the *y
and *ʔ were regularly metathesized, *raʔaya > *rayaʔa which then regularly
yielded /rāʔ/. Alternatively, one might imagine that the intervocalic hamzah
had dropped yielding *raʔaya > rāya which then, similar to *samāy ‘sky’ shifted
its word final y to ʔ, likewise yielding /rāʔ/.
In the former development one would expect the verb to have completely
merged with verbs of the typeجا
/ǧāʔ/, in which case one would predict the
first and second person forms to be likeجيت
/ǧīt/. But this does not seem to be
the case.The Cairoeditionattestsbothاريت
‘did yousee?’ (e.g.Q18:63)andرايت
‘you saw’ (e.g. Q47:20).99 In Early Quranic manuscripts it is not at all uncom-

Orthographic Comparison
This study tries to uncover the linguistic features of Quranic Arabic by focusing
on the earliest layer of the written text, Quranic Consonantal Text. This is the
standard philological approach to studying languages of antiquity, but doing
this to the Quran is not without its problems. As of writing, there is no critical
edition of the Quranic text, and the field generally relies on the standard text
established by the Cairo Edition. This edition is by no means a poor edition, as
its orthography is explicitly archaizing. It has attempted to reconstructed the
originalUthmanicrasmasmuchaspossiblebyrelyingonmedievalrasmworks

reported about manuscripts that predated them by yet another couple of cen-
turies.
Comparison with Quranic manuscripts shows that these descriptions in-
deed are fairly reliable guides to the orthography as it appears in the earliest
manuscripts. However, they are not always accurate, and throughout this work
I have sometimes had to draw upon the orthographic practices as they appear
inearlymanuscriptsratherthanhowtheyappearinthece.WhenIdoso,Irefer
to entries in this Appendix, which presents tables of certain important lexical
items and it examines how they appear in early manuscripts. These compara-
tive tables will function as “critical editions” not of the full Quranic text, but of
the individual specific words that are being examined.
From the following tables it will quickly become clear that, most of the time
the manuscript records show a remarkably consistent picture, all sharing the
same spelling with only the occasional exception. Not infrequently, the Cairo
Edition is the odd one out. When such a consistent picture emerges, there
can be little doubt that what we find in these manuscripts can be confidently
reconstructed for the archetype, despite the Cairo Edition showing something
different.
Throughoutthisappendix,Ihaveconsistentlydrawnonseveralmanuscripts

tables are given here. On occasion it has been relevant to cite other manu-
scripts, in which case I will discuss them individually below the relevant table.

Theselectionof themanuscriptsconsultedisbasedtoalargeextentonavail-
ability. All of these manuscripts contain a significant portion of the Quranic
text, and a good number of them are considerably early. Several of the ones
consulted (especially gk, S, M-Ali, and S-Ali) are probably to be dated some-
what later than the other manuscripts consulted here. These, however, are
rather complete examples, and therefore frequently allow us to establish what
the orthography continued to look like in later manuscripts (more often than
not, there is hardly a difference between earlier and later manuscripts in this
regard).

su = Codex Ṣanʿāʾ i, upper text
Sanaa Dār al-Maxṭūṭāt, dam 01–27.1 +
Ḥamdūn (2004) + auctioned folios: Christie’s 2008; Bonhams 2000;
Sotheby’s 1992 and Sotheby’s 1993.
80 folios; 578–669ce 2σ (95.4%)/606–649, σ2 (95.4%) (Coranica); Hi-
jazi i.
The upper text of the Sanaa palimpsest must of course post-date the
lower text, but can still be considered an early Quranic manuscript
from the first or early second century on the basis of its orthogra-
phy.
1 For an approximate dating of the C.iii style see Cellard (2015, 212).

Yī with Two yāʔs
As yuḥyī and yastayī are rather commonly attested, to save
space I have not included every single instance of them in this
table. Nevertheless, as you will see in the following table, the
spelling with two yāʔs in early manuscripts is clearly regular,
and quick examinations have shown that this is no different
for the attestations that have not been included here.

Luʔluʔ
All forms of /lūlū/ ‘pearl’ should probably be reconstructed
with an ʔalif al-wiqāyah for the ut, although the ce reports
lacks these in some cases.
