It is clear that the contributions in this volume are not only insightful, but also wide-ranging,
reaching into popular culture and across different media forms and practices. Rather than directly
comment on this writing further, though, I offered to supplement the topics of these essays by
pointing to a few additional categories of computational, poetic production that seem rich but
relatively overlooked.
Interactive Fiction
Over the past 40 years, interactive ﬁction has occupied several different places in computing and
in culture. When the ﬁrst widely-released version of Adventure by Will Crowther and Don Woods
became available to users of time-sharing systems in 1976, it hit them like a wrecking ball. Legends tell
that productivity ceased for days, or weeks, while those who were supposed to be programming
explored the simulated cave system. Then people in the US and UK went on to program their
own Adventure-like games, or, simply, adventure games. Zork was a successful and memorable one,
originally created at MIT by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Dave Lebling and Bruce Daniels and then
made into a trilogy of home-computer games by Blank and Lebling. Interactive ﬁction was a pillar of
the emerging entertainment software industry—videogames, or to be more speciﬁc, computer games.
In the 1980s “interactive ﬁction” (or “IF”) was more widely used a term for this type of production,
or “text adventure” if one wanted to distinguish the graphical adventure.
By the 1990s, IF was signiﬁcantly less lucrative in the marketplace; it eventually ceased have a
commercial life. Meanwhile, however, free development systems were being created and released
and an amateur scene was growing. New sorts of games never imagined by companies were made
—yes, “games,” they were and are called within the community, although many don’t have a score
and can’t be won. I wrote my book Twisty Little Passages (Montfort 2003) in this context. Since then,
the development of interactive ﬁction and the community has continued, with several new twists.
One is the advent of Twine, a hypertext editing system by Chris Klimas that has been used to develop
numerous experimental hypertexts dealing with identity and trauma.
The Interactive Fiction Competition (http://ifcomp.org/), a community-organized event that is
the main annual activity in English-language interactive ﬁction, took place once again during October
and November 2017. This was the 23rd instance of the event, which had the largest number of entries
ever: 79 of them. For the second time, the competition was operated by a non-proﬁt organization,
the recently established Interactive Fiction Technology Foundation. Anyone can enter this online
competition, at no cost, and anyone who plays a few games can judge. A great way to see what is
happening in the IF community is to try some of the entries in the latest “Comp,” as it is called by IF
authors and players.
Of the many striking Twine games, I’ll mention one that makes unusual use of computation,
blending elements of a simulation game with a hypertext ﬁction. This is the uncanny Horse Master:
The Game of Horse Mastery, released in 2013 by Tom McHenry (http://tommchenry.itch.io/horse-

master). There are many other compelling ones to be found on hosting site (http://philome.la/),
and there is a good book introducing these games, Videogames for Humans (Kopas 2015).
In what is now called “parser-based” interactive ﬁction (the Adventure kind, where the system
accepts and understands typed input) there have been computational developments in the simulation
of the world and in the way play and interaction transpire. Andrew Plotkin’s Hadean Lands (http:
//hadeanlands.com/), a commercial game in the Infocom tradition, continues to reﬁne and improve
on the classic text adventure by offering an elaborate simulation of a magical world and by modeling
how a character learns to undertake complex procedures. Another long-time IF author, Emily Short,
has been developing interactive ﬁction in which the social situation is explicitly modeled and inﬂuences
characters. A recent mid-size work of hers is one that uses procedural generation and allows the player
to train an AI character: The Mary Jane of Tomorrow (http://emshort.wordpress.com/tag/the-mary-
jane-of-tomorrow/).
Bots
There is now an explosion of interest in automating various sorts of instrumental tasks, such as
retail and customer support interactions. The raft of creative bots, ﬂoating largely upon the sea of Twitter,
has, surprisingly, almost nothing to do with the corporate formulation of the bot. These systems are
reconﬁguring word and image in surprising ways, often at regular intervals, reworking and interjecting
themselves into human discourse. Botmaker Allison Parrish describes them as a “performative critique
of procedural writing,” skateboarding on the corporate landscape of social media in artful ways that
were never intended.
It can be hard to understand the appeal of certain bots outside of the context of Twitter. A bot
might produce 20 lackluster tweets for every one that’s particularly funny or disturbing; if its faithful
user/creator retweets its greatest hits, it can end up receiving acclaim. Also, bots might produce
outputs which are particularly great to see in the context of a Twitter feed, even if they wouldn’t read
as well when standing alone. Finally, bots can be part of social media interactions, for instance by
replying to others but also because others can retweet their tweets and reply to them.
Although removing a bot from its environment can be problematic, it’s also useful to preserve
things about them. To accomplish this, the Electronic Literature Collection, Volume 3 includes a selection of
bots (http://collection.eliterature.org/3/collection-bots.html). These include @everyword, by Parrish,
which simply enumerated every English word (in a particular list, of course) and managed to inspire
dozens of enumerative verbal bots. Additionally: @rom-txt by Zach Whalen harvests texts from
videogame ROMs; @TwoHeadlines by Darius Kazemi conﬂates journalistic titles, as it says on
the tin; @wikisext by thricedotted presents sexual text messages inspired by online instructions;
@tiny_star_ﬁeld by Katie Rose Pipkin builds skyscapes from Unicode characters; and @pentametron
by Ranjit Bahtnagar, which builds an endless epic poem, in heroic couplets, out of unsuspecting tweets.
Bots often generate texts and images in a ﬁctional or poetic mode, and often produce humorous
outputs, but being funny isn’t mandatory, and they can also be documentary. @CensusAmericans by
Jia Zhang produces tiny biographical sketches directly based on US Census data from 2009–2013—for
instance, “I work in travel arrangements and reservation services. I am divorced. I have an associate’s
degree. I have multiple ancestries.”
Note, too, that bots are not exclusively focused on the present and the current social world. One of
many bots by Hugo, @houseofdust, reimplements an inﬂuential 1967 computational poem by Alison
Knowles and James Tenney.
In any case, to truly appreciate a Twitter bot, it’s best to follow it (or someone who retweets it) for
a while and see how it contributes to the chorus of your social media reading.
Generated Novels
There have been various attempts to generate long poems and novels by computer over the years,
but the ﬂoodgates were opened by Darius Kazemi in 2013. On November 1 of that year he tweeted,

Humanities 2018, 7, 23

seemingly as a joke, in response to National Novel Writing Month or NaNoWriMo, which had just
begun, a suggestion: “NaNoGenMo: spend the month writing code that generates a 50 k word novel,
share the novel & the code at the end.” As it happened, many people were willing to join him in this
quixotic endeavor, and more have been in years since that announcement.
For instance, in 2013 Leonard Richardson generated a book that conﬂated Alice’s Adventures
in Wonderland and Moby Dick.
(The white whale became the de facto mascot of NaNoGenMo,
with many people generating novels that transformed Melville’s in some way.) Richardson’s novel,
Alice’s Adventures in the Whale, remarkably replaced all of the quoted dialog in Lewis Carroll’s novel
with dialog from Moby Dick, and thus has a ﬁrst paragraph that concludes “‘Can’t sell his head?—What
sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me?’ thought Alice ‘Do you pretend to say, landlord,
that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning,
in peddling his head around this town?’”
During the second NaNoGenMo, in 2014, Allison Parrish contributed I Waded in Clear Water,
which was based on the classic American text Ten Thousand Dreams Interpreted. The actions imagined in
dreams were ordered according to their sentiment, from most negative to most positive, and elaborating
footnotes were added. The result was a stark, declarative text with unusual typography (for a novel),
loaded with extreme situations.
One of the most amazing generated novels from that year, and one that makes an impact after
only a glance, is Liza Daly’s Seraphs. This was a text, with images, similar in appearance to the
c. 15th Century Voynich Manuscript (Clemens 2016) and recalling also the much more recent Codex
Seraphinianus (Seraﬁni 1981). It is ﬁlled with inscrutable but systematic glyphs that are arranged
alongside encyclopedic pictures. Daly made her book available for download as a PDF and also offered
it for sale as a print-on-demand book (Daly 2015).
One thread of novel-generating practice that stands out in these examples, and distinguishes them
from many other practices, is a strong relationship to one or two well-known source texts, although
authors have explored numerous relationships. The NaNoGenMo sites, with links to work and code,
are hosted as GitHub repositories, beginning in 2013 at (http://github.com/dariusk/NaNoGenMo).
Other recommendations for outstanding generated novels can be found by searching the Web or
Twitter for “NaNoGenMo.”
Generating book-length literary art with the computer is an intense area of work for me currently.
I am editing the book series Using Electricity, a series of computer-generated books from Counterpath;
the director of this press selected my book-length poem. The Truelist, as the ﬁrst volume (Montfort 2018).
Two other books, Mexica (Pérez y Pérez 2017) and Articulations (Parrish 2018) are already in print,
and at least two more will be published before the end of 2018. I also recently put together the exhibit,
Author Function, displaying printed books of this sort, for one of the MIT Libraries.
Digital Writing in Performance
Electronic literature has been presented in person by authors for a while, sometimes in the familiar
format of a literary reading, sometimes in more of a demo mode, and sometimes in performances that
are signiﬁcantly distinct from these. For instance, numerous readings of The Unknown, a hypertext
novel, were staged by William Gillespie, Scott Rettberg, and Dirk Stratton. During these, a hotel bell
was rung every time a link was encountered, inviting the audience to leave the current text if they
were interested in that link (or bored with what was being read at that point). The authors dressed up
for these occasions and took turns reading from their collaborative novel.
While The Unknown (http://unknownhypertext.com, also included in The Electronic Literature
Collection, Volume 2, http://collection.eliterature.org/2/) was presented as a sort of literary reading,
with interesting deviations and invitations to the audience, other digital writers have developed
performances that start from other points. J. R. Carpenter and Jerome Fletcher have presented digital
performance writing pieces in which the performance is intended as a particularly signiﬁcant or
primary channel for the work. Their projects include “Along the Briny Beach” and “Whisper Wire,”

the online versions of which can be found at Carpenter’s site (http://luckysoap.com). Judd Morrissey,
individually and in collaboration, has done work that ranges from interactive electronic text on screen
(The Jew’s Daughter, included in The Electronic Literature Collection, Volume 1, http://collection.eliterature.
org/1/) to theatrical productions incorporating projection and digital texts. One of the latter is The
Operature, a 90-min performance of the collective Anatomical Theatres of Mixed Reality (ATOM-r),
of which he was a founder.
Those involved with digital writing keep showing, into the 2010s, that the possibilities for
performance have not been exhausted. The format of Todd Anderson’s website (http://hotwriting.net)
gives some particular hints about his performance style. Using the Windows program AutoHotkey,
he remaps his keyboard so that it cues audiovisual elements. Wearing a wireless keyboard on a strap
around his neck, he speaks, croons, and sometimes just watches the multimedia show he is cuing.
His presentation is based more on scrappy musical performances than theater or literary readings.
While Anderson has innovated with interface and in terms of the framework for performance,
computation has been involved in composing performances as well. Annie Dorsen’s A Piece of Work,
performed in several cities in 2013, is a play in which a new version of Hamlet is algorithmically
generated each night.
Onward & Outward
I hope these brief comments are of use to people who wish to cast their eyes around the fringe of
computational, poetic territory, looking for developments in the past decade. Although I’m sure I am
missing out on several other new types of practice, I offer these ideas for further reading, some covering
practices that have yet to be critically discussed in depth, many of them very exciting.
