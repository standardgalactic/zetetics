Appendix D2:
Analysis of Enthymemes in Galatians
(Refer to Appendix H for explanation of terms and codes)
_____________________________
Gal 1:1-5. This prescript contains no enthymemes.
_____________________________
1.
Gal 1:7-8.
Preferred approach: topical.
The topic of the more and the less: if A is B, then less than A is all the more certain to be B; where:
A = “us”  (someone on Paul's apostolic team) or “an angel from heaven” preaching another gospel;
B = someone perverting the gospel and deserving •<V2,:" for it. 
The argument rephrased: if even we or angel comes to you with a different gospel, it will be a perverted
gospel (and he will be accursed for this); therefore, any mere human preacher who preaches a different
gospel is preaching a perverted gospel and will be accursed for it. For the purposes of this study, another
paraphrase is: 
{M
“We” (apostles) and angels from heaven are more trustworthy teachers than anyone else.}
m
“We” (apostles) and angels from heaven are perverting the gospel when we preach a “different” gospel.
=>
ALL THE MORE REASON, any human being is perverting the gospel when preaching “another” gospel.
Marker:
•88  6"Â  ¦<
Basis:
marker introduces a rationale statement for a truth claim in v.7 that there is no other gospel.
Intensity:
high
Themes:
-{relig./Israel (and Chr.)/authority of angels and apostles (hierarchy, truth, value)} 1:7-8
- relig./Chr./gospel/unicity of the gospel (truth) 1:7-8
Other:
(a) the expression ajnavqema e[stw has a strong emotional effect which heightens the intensity of
the enthymeme ; (b) v. 8 and v. 9 are two rationale statements which both found the truthfulness
of v.7 (as two separate Es.; see below).
RSV:
7 not that there is another gospel, but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the
gospel of Christ. 8 But even if (•88 6"Â ¦<) we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you
a gospel contrary to that which we preached to you, let him be accursed.
_____________________________
1:6-9. The main issue at stake.
_____________________________
2.
Gal 1:7,9.
Preferred approach: syllogistic (though topical is possible; see “comments” below).
{M
Any gospel which draws an anathema is not the true gospel.}
m
Any gospel different from ours (Paul’s) draws an anathema (onto its promulgators ; v.9).
=>
Any gospel different from ours is not the true gospel (7b).
=>
There is no other gospel apart from the one you received from us  (7a).
Marker:
none (apart from the solemn words of v.9a which alert the addressees as to the importance of
what is in fact the rationale statement).

2
Basis:
v.9 establishes the truth of the claim in v.7.
Intensity:
high.
Themes:
-{relig./Israel/covenant/inclusion and exclusion (truth)} 1:7,9
- relig./Chr./covenant/unicity of the gospel (truth) 1:7,9  
Other:
this could also have been analysed topically, as an argument from contraries: claim A is true,
since the contrary claim is untenable or unacceptable (A = there is only one gospel). 
RSV:
7 not that there is another gospel, but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the
gospel of Christ [...] 9 As we have said before, so now I say again, If any one is preaching to you a
gospel contrary to that which you received, let him be accursed.
_____________________________
Gal 1:10-2:14. Autobiographical section proving from key events that Paul’s gospel is the only true gospel and
giving initial proof that Torah is unnecessary for salvation.
_____________________________
REJECT: Gal 1:6-10.
REASON: the gavr of v. 10 is not to be viewed as inferential. It is consecutive, introducing a new paragraph.
Literature: most commentators agree, as well as NA27r. Disagree: Vos (p.10) views v.10 as proof of vv.6-9, i.e. that
Paul not being a flatterer of men is proof (from h\qo~) that his message is the only true gospel. The problem with
this interpretation is that Paul changes the subject too quickly and too abruptly from v. 11 on to view v.10 as
relating directly to vv.6-9 as a ratio. When Paul uses the topos of his trustworthiness as a teacher in other
instances, his custom is to develop it considerably, giving evidence from his past behaviour and attitudes, as in  1
Thess 2 for example. It seems more convincing that Paul is evoking an accusation about his trustworthiness, to
which he will return later. He does just that in 5:11 and in 4:  
RSV*: 10 [For] (ga;r) Am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still
pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. 
_____________________________
3.
Gal 1:10.
Preferred approach: the topic of contrarium (conjunctive syllogism of the form NOT [A AND B]; NOW A; => NOT
B). 
M
Someone cannot be both a servant of Christ and a pleaser of men (10b). 
{m
I am a servant of Christ.}
{=>
I am not a pleaser of men.}
Marker:
interrogative form + if ... then ...
Basis:
Literature:
Agree: Vos (10).
Intensity:
low. This appears to be a side argument, answering an unknown accusation. It will be tied to the
main issue later in the epistle in 5:10-12 and 6:12-17 (see 6.1.7.b).
Themes:
-{Pract./Chr./serving Christ precludes pleasing men (value)} 1:10
- Paul/character/faithfulness to Christ (fact) 1:10
Other:
(a) binary ideological landscape which places service of Christ and pleasing humans at opposite
poles; (b) example of a silent conclusion.   
RSV: 
10 Am I now seeking the favour of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If (eij) I were
still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ. 
_____________________________
REJECT: Gal 1:10b-11.
REASON: It is not clear at all that an inference can be drawn from v. 11 to yield v. 10b. It is interesting to note
that marker itself (the (VD of v.11) is textually uncertain.
Literature: Disagree: Vos p.11.
RSV: 10 ...If I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.  11 For (ga;r) I would have you know,
brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not man’s gospel.

Gal 1:11b-12.
Preferred approach: syllogistic.
{M
Whatever teaching comes through a revelation of Jesus Christ and not received from a human source is
not of human origin.}
m
“I did not receive [my gospel] from a human source, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a
revelation of Jesus-Christ” (12).
=>
My gospel was not of human origin (11b).
Marker:
(VD
Basis:
Literature: 
Agree: Vos, p.12. He adds an extra step after the conclusion, which he views as implied (“my
gospel is not of human origin, therefore it is true”). Other: Hansen (89) sees vv.11-12 as the
proof for the truth claim of vv.6-9. He views this combination as the main – structural – E. of the
entire epistle.
Intensity:
high (main E. of the section 1:11-24).
Themes:
-{relig./Chr./revelation (truth)} 1:11b-12
- Paul/biography/calling (fact) 1:11b-12
Other:
the ideological landscape evoked by the rationale is binary: humanity and Christ are presented as
two mutually exclusive sources of teaching.
RSV:
 11 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not man’s
gospel (6"J –<2DTB@<). 12 For ((D) I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it
came through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 
_____________________________
REJECT: Gal 1:12-2:10.
REASON: this passage can be viewed as a complex argument composed of several warrants which together form
an inductive, cumulative proof. As such this is not an enthymeme but a complex arg.  Verse 1:12 is the claim, and
it is backed up by the various autobiographical elements of 1:13-2:10.
RSV: 12 For I did not receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through a revelation of Jesus Christ. 13 For
you have heard of my former life in Judaism...
_____________________________
REJECT: Gal 1:20.
REASON: This statement “backs up” the autobiographical passage that precedes it, but not really as an
argumentative premise. Rather, it is a sworn oath. Its persuasive power is not drawn from reason but from the
general area of the author's µ2@H. It can also be viewed as atechnical proof. 
RSV: 20 (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!)

5.
Gal 2:6a.
Preferred approach: syllogistic (two sequential syllogisms).
{M1
Anyone viewed without partiality by God will be viewed the same way by Paul.}
m1
All humans are viewed without partiality by God   (6ab; Deut 10:7).
{M2
=>
All humans are viewed without partiality by Paul}
{m2
Those (in Jerusalem) who were reputed to be something are humans.}
=>
Those (in Jerusalem) reputed to be something are viewed without partiality by Paul (6aa).
Marker:
None. Paratactic E..
Basis:
Paul justifies his relativizing of  the status of the  “pillars” with a theological principle (Betz 93-
4). This can also be seen as a Scriptural enthymeme (the minor premise uses Dt 10:17).
Intensity:
low (Paul’s point here is parenthetical with respect to the main argument).
Themes:
-{pract./Israel and Chr./imitation of God (truth/value)} 2:6a #1

- relig./Israel/God/character (truth) 2:6a #1
-{pract./Israel and Chr./imitation of God (truth/value)} 2:6a #2
-{non-relig./common sense/authority figures remain human (fact)} 2:6a #2
Other:
The E. is quite plain despite the exegetical difficulties of this verse, especially the meaning of the
expression ojpoi`oiv pote and the enigmatic difference in tenses between h\san (“they were”) and
diafevrei.
RSV:
6 And from those who were reputed to be something (what they were makes no difference to me;
God shows no partiality)...

6.
Gal 2:7-8.
Preferred approach: syllogistic
{M
Any apostle that God sends to a distinct people is also entrusted with a “gospel for that people.”}
m
God worked through Peter making him an apostle to the circumcised and also worked through me in
sending me to the Gentiles (8).
=>
I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted the gospel for
the circumcised (7).
Marker:
(VD
Basis:
Intensity:
low (Paul’s point here is parenthetical with respect to the main argument).
Themes:
-{relig./Chr./gospel/universality, contextuality (truth, value)} 2:7-8
- Paul/biography/calling with respect to Peter’s calling (fact) 2:7-8
Other:
(a) In Paul's view, God sees two religious categories of people: the circumcised and the Gentiles.
For this reason, it would be feasible to attempt to solve this E. with the topic from the parts to the
whole; (b) implicit in Paul's interpretation of God's calling of apostles is the equal footing of the
two mission fields: Jew and Gentile. 
RSV:
 7 but on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the
uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised 8 (for he ((D)
who worked through Peter for the mission to the circumcised worked through me also for the
Gentiles)...
_____________________________
7.
Gal 2:14b.
Preferred approach: the topic of contrarium (conjunctive syllogism of the form NOT [A AND B]; NOW A; => NOT
B). 
{M
You cannot have a Jew who is “ not living according to Judaism” AND  “compelling Gentiles to live
according to Judaism,”  for this would be contradictory and hypocritical.}
m
Cephas is a Jew not living according to Judaism (since he eats with Gentiles).
=>
Cephas cannot compel Gentiles to live according to Judaism.
Marker:
(a) the interrogative form in two parts set in opposition is typical of the contrarium; (b) if...then.
Basis:
it fits the profile of the contrarium very nicely.
Intensity:
high (this arg. is the central pronouncement within a narrative).
Themes:
-{pract./Israel/prerequisites for proselytism (truth/value)} 2:14b
- current text/previous/Peter’s behaviour during the Antioch episode (fact) 2:14b
Other:
This arg. is easy to analyse because the narrative context in which it was uttered is described in
detail.
RSV:
14 But when I saw that they were not straightforward about the truth of the gospel, I said to
Cephas before them all, “If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you
compel the Gentiles to live like Jews?” 
_____________________________
Gal 2:15-21 is an argumentative section which states that since Jews themselves cannot be justified through

5
practise of the Torah but only through faith in Christ, this is the case for everyone. Kennedy views this entire
section as an epikheirema (Kennedy 1984, 148).

Gal 2:17-18.
Preferred approach: syll.
{M
Christ cannot be blamed for those who reestablish the law upon themselves.}
m
All those in Christ who view themselves as condemned (sinners) are reestablishing the law upon
themselves (18). 
=>
Christ cannot be blamed for those in Christ who view themselves as condemned (17).

Intensity:

Themes:
-{relig./Chr./covenant/being “in Christ” (truth)} 2:17-18.
- non-relig./social/legal systems (truth) 2:17-18.
Other:
this E. is based on a deduction from metaphor.
RSV*:
17 But if, in our endeavour to be justified in Christ, we ourselves were found to be sinners, is
Christ then an agent of sin? Certainly not! 18 But ((D) if I build up again those things which I
tore down, then I prove myself a transgressor.
_____________________________
9.
Gal 2:18-19.
Preferred approach: syllogistic.
{M
Anyone who has died through the law (incurred its death penalty) is no longer under the law [its
jurisdiction being dissolved].}
m
“Through the law I died to the law” [by believing in Christ] (v.19a).
{=>
I am no longer under the law. In my case the law is dissolved  (v.18).}
Marker:
(VD
Basis:
Intensity:
high (important step of the argument) 
Themes:
-{non-relig./social/legal systems (truth)} 2:18-19
- relig./Chr./covenant/Christians/crucified with Christ (truth) 2:18-19 
Other:
v.18 implies the conclusion of the E., namely that “in my (Paul’s) case, the law is something that
I have dissolved.”
RSV*:
18 But if I build up again those things which I tore down, then I prove myself a transgressor. 19 For
I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God. 
_____________________________
REJECT: Gal 2:19-20.
REASON: "I have been crucified with Christ" and what follows in v. 20 may be viewed a rationale for Paul's
affirmation that he has "died to the law, in order to live for God." But there is no clear indication of inference.
RSV: 19 For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God. 20 I have been crucified with Christ; it is no
longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me; and the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God,
who loved me and gave himself for me.

Gal 2:21.
Preferred approach: syllogistic. Two syllogisms are present:
{M
Anyone who believes that Christ’s death is unnecessary for justification is nullifying the grace of God.}

6
m
A person who believes that the law justifies believes that Christ’s death is unnecessary. (see analysis of
v.21b below).
{=>
A person who believes that the law justifies is nullifying the grace of God.}
AND:
{M
Anyone “living for God” (v.19b) refuses to nullify the grace of God.}
m
I (Paul) am living for God (19b).
{=>
I (Paul) refuse to nullify the grace of God [by seeking justification through the law] (v.21a).}
Marker:
(VD
Basis:
Intensity:
high. The emotional content of this enthymeme is important. Its position as conclusion of the
paragraph also heightens its psychological effect.

RSV:
 21 I do not nullify the grace of God; for ((D) if justification were through the law, then Christ
died to no purpose.

11.
Gal 2:21b.
Preferred approach: hypothetical syll. The full argument is composed of two consecutive syllogisms:
{M
If God has already given a means of justification, then any “new” means of justification would be 
unnecessary (dwreavn).}
{m
The death of Christ can be seen as a “new” means of justification with respect to the law.}
M
=>
If God has already given a means of justification (obedience to the law), then the death of Christ
is unnecessary (21b).  
{m
God has not already given a means of justification (in the law).}
{=>
The death of Christ is not unnecessary.}
Marker:

Basis:
Intensity:
high. The emotional as well as the theological content of this enthymeme are important. Its
position as conclusion of the paragraph also heightens its psychological effect. 
Themes:

-{relig./Chr./covenant/existing incorrect views (fact)} 2:21b #1
- relig./Chr./gospel/relation between Christ and the law (truth/hierarchy) 2:21b #2
-{relig./Israel/God/means of salvation (truth)} 2:21b #2
Other:
(a) forms a sorites with the preceding E. (b) The solution of this arg. is congruent with E.P.
Sanders’ explanation of Paul’s rejection of Torah as means of salvation: if practise of Torah can
save, then Christ’s death (and Paul’s calling and ministry) is fundamentally unnecessary.
RSV:
 21 ... if (eij) justification were through the law, then (a[ra) Christ died to no purpose.
_____________________________
Gal. 3:1-4:11 is an argumentative section which begins and ends with a rebuke of the Galatians. The object is to
prove that justification through faith in Christ (and not through Torah observance) is actually warranted by the
Torah.

12.
Gal. 3:2.
Preferred approach: syllogistic 

7
{M
The disposition which induced God's initial gift of the Spirit will (likely) still please him.}
m
You received from God the gift of the Spirit  by believing what you heard, not by the works of the law .

Themes:
-{relig./Israel/God/character/does not change (truth)} 3:2
- addressees/conversion/reception of Spirit (fact; sure sign) 3:2
Other:
(a) there is also a temporal component to the arg.: God does not change, thus the manner in
which he initiates the covenant must still apply now; (b) can also be approached as a disjunctive
syllogism. Siegert takes this route but his solution is not very rigorous: M.: Did you receive the
Spirit by works of law or faith?; silent m.: through faith; silent conclusion. Therefore the works
of the law are useful no more (Siegert 193); (c) lying behind the major premiss is a more
fundamental presupposition, in this case a topic related to change: what works is to be
continued; the burden of proof is on those who wish to bring about a change. 
RSV:
 2 Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law, or by hearing with
faith?

13.
Gal. 3:3.
Preferred approach: syllogistic
{M
Anyone who does not end the way they began (in their covenant relationship with God) is foolish.} 
m

(3a).

- addressees/spiritual history (fact) 3:3
Other:
While the silent major premise can be associated with a topic related to change in general (as
here), it can also be linked to the more specific, theological theme of the unchanging nature of
God and of the covenant relationship with God.    
RSV:
 3 Are you so foolish? Having begun with the Spirit, are you now ending with the flesh?

Themes:
-{non-relig./common sense/learning from experience (value)} 3:4
- addressees/spiritual history (likelihood) 3:4
Other:
(a) in this entire section (3:1-5), Paul's argumentation seeks to ridicule the Galatians' position by
showing that it is “foolish,” i.e. in contradiction with their own beliefs and experience (see P/OT
276-79); (b) as in the E. in 3:3, the silent major premise is associated with a common topic

8
related to general common sense, although it can also be linked to a more specific topic in the
domain of spiritual experience (i.e. not simply learning from experience, but learning about God
through experience of God).     
RSV:
 4 Did you experience so many things in vain? —if it really is in vain.

Anyone who receives Abraham’s inheritance from God is Abraham’s son.}
{m1
Righteousness is Abraham’s inheritance from God.}
{M3

Abraham believed God to receive righteousness (v.6; quoting and interpreting Gen
15:6).

Marker:
5"2fH ... –D" ...
Basis:
Scriptural E. While this argument is inductive more than it is deductive, it contains an inference
nonetheless and can be called an E.
Literature: 
Disagree: Kennedy  sees in 3:6-9 a single enthymeme, but his syllogistic analysis is unclear: “The
true sons of Abraham are ‘men of faith’; Abraham was promised that in him ‘all nations’ would
be blessed; therefore those who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith”
(Kennedy 1984, 149). Anderson works out five syllogisms underlying 3:6-14 (I have 7), but his
syllogistic analysis is also unclear (Anderson 139-141).

Other:
If indeed there is an echo of Isa 45:25 here, Paul's shift from “descendants of Israel” to “sons of
Abraham” is in harmony with his overt preference for the Abrahamic covenant expressed
elsewhere in Galatians (see 3:17; 4:21-31). 
RSV:
6 Thus (5"2fH) Abraham “believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.” 7 So
(–D") you see that it is men of faith who are the sons of Abraham.

beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you shall all the nations be blessed.” 9 So then (òFJ,), those
who are men of faith are blessed with Abraham who had faith.

establish the missing major premise of 3:11, namely that “No one seeking justification through 
the law lives by faith.” I hesitate nonetheless to call 3:11-12 an epikheirema because there is a
missing step (a silent enthymeme) which Paul omits between the conclusion of 3:12 and the
missing premiss of 3:11 (presumably for the sake of brevity): no one seeking justification through 
the law lives by faith, FOR the law does not promise justification to those who have faith (this
silent arg. rests on the likelihood that no one who understands that justification comes through
faith would seek justification through a system that does not “reward” faith).

similar argument is given in 4.7b: “And if a son, then also an heir, through God.” (c) This

low because this is not logically binding. However, the affectionate, pleading tone (devomai uJmw`n;
Morris 137) intensifies the emotional effect. The style (brevity, chiastic structure) adds to the
psychological effect. The gnomic form creates an effect of paradox (Betz calls this passage a
“gnomic paradox”, p. 221).

Other:
Expressions of friendship in the form of “becoming like” the other person, to the point of sharing
in their misfortunes, were taken as sure signs of friendship in the common opinion of the ancient
world (Betz 222), for friendship had to be proven in the ancient world which was structured by
relations of inequality and where the intimate rapport of amicitia was a rare and valued
occurrence. The reasoning of friendship makes sense on the emotional plane and in the light of 1
Cor 9:19-23: since I, Paul, have become like you, a person without Torah, to proclaim the gospel
to you, I beg you to reciprocate by remaining like me as “Christians outside the Jewish Torah”;
this would be a sure sign of your true friendship for me (see Betz 221-223).

In Gal 4:21-31 is Paul’s final argument from Scripture (Gen 21, Isa 54) to establish the superiority of faith over
the law. The main argument is allegorical.
_____________________________
REJECT: Gal 4:24-26.
REASON: While it could be argued that (VD introduces the rationale for the claim of allegory, what follows it
constitutes more of an expository passage on the allegory and thus its inferences are complex.
RSV:  24 Now this is an allegory: ((VD; not translated) these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai,
bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar. 25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present
Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children. 26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
_____________________________
REJECT: Gal 4:25.
REASON: This presents itself as an E., but the inferences within allegorical interpretation (such as this one) are
idiosyncratic and transcend logical or rational description.
RSV: 25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for ((VD) she is in slavery
with her children.
_____________________________
REJECT: Gal 4:26-28.
REASON: the arg. which establishes the “Jerusalem above” as the true mother of Gentile believers and all
believers (the inference is in v. 26) is allegorical. “The aptness of the quotation is not immediately evident” (Hays
1983, 118), and is done in an “allusive, echo-laden manner” (119). Hence we are dealing with far more than an E. 
Wisse has proposed the following syllogism as supporting the arg.: {M All children of the promise have Sarah as
their mother (paraphrase of Paul’s interpretation of Is 54:1)}; m We are children of the promise (28); => Sarah is

18
our mother (26b; Wisse 1996, 2).  
RSV: 26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. 27 For it is written ((X(D"BJ"4 (VD) ,“Rejoice, O
barren one who does not bear; break forth and shout, you who are not in travail; for the children of the desolate one
are many more than the children of her that is married.” 28 Now (dev) we, brethren, like Isaac, are children of
promise.

Another way to look at this passage is to see 5:3 as an enthymematic warning. An illustration of
such an warning is the well-known “trespassers will be prosecuted,” which implies the following

Other:
(a) this arg. can also be treated as a contrarium (Kraus 1206-07):  NOT “preaching without
scandal” AND “persecution”; BUT NOW “persecution”; THEREFORE NOT “preaching without
scandal.” What is important here is that Paul attributes this to the “scandal of the cross,” i.e. to
his insistence that the cross renders circumcision useless for justification; (b) Betz calls this arg.
“puzzling”: “What the apostle has in mind will in all likelihood always be hidden from our
knowledge” (Betz 268). (c) The arg. is not a strong one, since the major premiss M1 is weak.
Circumcision the certainly not the only religious value of the offended party.

law, then the risk of incurring a curse is even greater for Gentile believers who accept only certain items of the law
in order to identify with Israel” (Hansen 1989, 119-120). This interpretation requires some bold mirror-reading in
order get such a precise idea of the opponents’ identity (they are non-Gentiles) and of what they are asking the
Galatians to do. It appears that Paul is simply uncovering the opponents’ deceitfulness in giving the Galatians the
false impression that they are keeping the entire law.
