Preface
And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.
Genesis 1,3
Light is not only the basis of our biological existence, but also an essential
source of our knowledge about the physical laws of nature, ranging from
the seventeenth century geometrical optics up to the twentieth century
theory of general relativity and quantum electrodynamics.

Don’t give us numbers: give us insight!
A contemporary natural scientist to a mathematician
The present book is the second volume of a comprehensive introduction to
the mathematical and physical aspects of modern quantum ﬁeld theory which
comprehends the following six volumes:
Volume I: Basics in Mathematics and Physics
Volume II: Quantum Electrodynamics
Volume III: Gauge Theory
Volume IV: Quantum Mathematics
Volume V: The Physics of the Standard Model
Volume VI: Quantum Gravitation and String Theory.
It is our goal to build a bridge between mathematicians and physicists based
on the challenging question about the fundamental forces in
• macrocosmos (the universe) and
• microcosmos (the world of elementary particles).
The six volumes address a broad audience of readers, including both under-
graduate and graduate students, as well as experienced scientists who want
to become familiar with quantum ﬁeld theory, which is a fascinating topic in
modern mathematics and physics.
For students of mathematics, it is shown that detailed knowledge of the
physical background helps to motivate the mathematical subjects and to

discover interesting interrelationships between quite diﬀerent mathematical
topics. For students of physics, fairly advanced mathematics are presented,
which is beyond the usual curriculum in physics. The strategies and the
structure of the six volumes are thoroughly discussed in the Prologue to

basic ideas behind the technicalities. In this connection, the famous ancient
story of Ariadne’s thread is discussed in the Preface to Volume I. In terms

We try to ﬁnd the right balance between the mathematical theory and its
applications to interesting physical eﬀects observed in experiments. In par-
ticular, we do not consider purely mathematical models in this volume.
It is our philosophy that the reader should learn quantum ﬁeld theory
by studying a realistic model, as given by quantum electrodynamics.
Let us discuss the main structure of the present volume. In Chapters 1
through 4, we consider topics from classical mathematics which are closely
related to modern quantum ﬁeld theory. This should help the reader to un-
derstand the basic ideas behind quantum ﬁeld theory to be considered in
this volume and the volumes to follow. In Chapter 1 on the mathematical
principles of modern natural philosophy, we discuss
• the inﬁnitesimal strategy due to Newton and Leibniz,
• the optimality principle for processes in nature (the principle of critical action)
and the calculus of variations due to Euler and Lagrange, which leads to the
fundamental diﬀerential equations in classical ﬁeld theory,
• the propagation of physical eﬀects and the method of the Green’s function,
• harmonic analysis and the Fourier method for computing the Green’s functions,
• Laurent Schwartz’s theory of generalized functions (distributions) which is re-
lated to the idea that the measurement of physical quantities by devices is based
on averaging,
• global symmetry and conservation laws,
• local symmetry and the basic ideas of modern gauge ﬁeld theory, and
• the Planck quantum of action and the idea of quantizing classical ﬁeld theories.
Gauge ﬁeld theory is behind both
• the Standard Model in elementary particle physics and
• Einstein’s theory of gravitation (i.e., the theory of general relativity).
In quantum ﬁeld theory, a crucial role is played by renormalization. In terms
of physics, this is based on the following two steps:
• the regularization of divergent integrals, and
• the computation of eﬀective physical parameters measured in experiments (e.g.,
the eﬀective mass and the eﬀective electric charge of the electron).
Renormalization is a highly technical subject. For example, the full proof
on the renormalizability of the electroweak sector of the Standard Model in
particle physics needs 100 pages. This can be found in:
E. Kraus, Renormalization of the electroweak standard model to all orders,
Annals of Physics 262 (1998), 155–259.
Whoever wants to understand quantum ﬁeld theory has to understand the
procedure of renormalization. Therefore, the diﬀerent aspects of renormal-
ization theory will be studied in all of the six volumes of this series of mono-
graphs. This ranges from
• resonance phenomena for the anharmonic oscillator (classical bifurcation theory),
• the Poincar´e–Lindstedt series (including small divisors) in celestial mechanics,

X
Preface
• and the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser (KAM) theory for perturbed quasi-periodic
oscillations (e.g., in celestial mechanics) based on sophisticated iterative tech-
niques (the hard implicit function theorem)
to the following fairly advanced subjects:
• the Feynman functional integral (the Faddeev–Popov approach),
• the Wiener functional integral (the Glimm–Jaﬀe approach),
• the theory of higher-dimensional Abelian integrals (algebraic Feynman integrals),
• Hopf algebras and Rota–Baxter algebras in combinatorics (the modern vari-
ant of the Bogoliubov–Parasiuk–Hepp–Zimmermann (BPHZ) approach due to
Kreimer),
• the Riemann–Hilbert problem and the Birkhoﬀdecomposition (the Connes–
Kreimer approach),
• Hopf superalgebras (the Brouder–Fauser–Frabetti–Oeckl (BFFO) approach),
• characterization of physical states by cohomology and algebraic renormalization
(the Becchi–Rouet–Stora–Tyutin (BRST) approach),
• the Riesz–Gelfand theory of distribution-valued meromorphic functions (con-
struction of the Green’s functions),
• wave front sets and H¨ormander’s multiplication of distributions (the Stueckelberg–
Bogoliubov–Epstein–Glaser–Scharf approach),
• the Master Ward identity as a highly non-trivial renormalization condition and
the generalized Dyson–Schwinger equation (the D¨utsch–Fredenhagen approach),
• q-deformed quantum ﬁeld theory (the Wess–Majid–Wachter–Schmidt approach
based on the q-deformed Poincar´e group, quantum groups, and the q-analysis on
speciﬁc classes of q-deformed quantum spaces),
• deformation of bundles and quantization (the Weyl–Flato–Sternheimer–Fedosov–
Kontsevich approach),
• microlocal analysis and renormalization on curved space-times (the Radzikowski–
Brunetti–Fredenhagen–K¨ohler approach),
• renormalized operator products on curved space-times (the Wilson–Hollands–
Wald approach to quantum ﬁeld theory),
• natural transformations of functors in category theory and covariant quantum
ﬁeld theory on curved space-time manifolds (the Brunetti–Fredenhagen–Verch
approach),
as well as
• one-parameter Lie groups and the renormalization group,
• attractors of dynamical systems in the space of physical theories (the Wilson–
Polchinski–Kopper–Rivasseau approach to renormalization based on the renor-
malization group),
• the Master Ward Identity and the Stueckelberg–Petermann renormalization
group (the D¨utsch–Fredenhagen approach),
• motives in number theory and algebraic geometry, the Tannakian category, and
the cosmic Galois group as a universal (motivic) renormalization group (the
Connes–Marcolli approach),
• noncommutative geometry and renormalization (the Grosse–Wulkenhaar ap-
proach).
The recent work of Alain Connes, Dirk Kreimer, and Matilde Marcolli shows
convincingly that renormalization is rooted in highly nontrivial mathemati-
cal structures. We also want to emphasize that the theory of many-particle
systems (considered in statistical physics and quantum ﬁeld theory) is deeply
rooted in the theory of operator algebras. This concerns

• von Neumann algebras (the von Neumann approach),
• C∗-algebras (the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal approach),
• local nets of operator algebras (the Haag–Kastler approach) and,
• noncommutative geometry (the Connes approach).
As a warmup, we show in Chapter 2 that the regularization of divergent
expressions represents a main subject in the history of mathematics starting
with Euler in the eighteenth century. In this connection, we will consider
• the regularization of divergent series, and
• the regularization of divergent integrals.
In particular, in Sect. 2.1.3, we will discuss the classical Mittag–Leﬄer theo-
rem on meromorphic functions f. If the function f has merely a ﬁnite number
of poles, then the method of partial fraction decomposition works well. How-
ever, as a rule, this method fails if the function f has an inﬁnite number of
poles. In this case, Mittag–Leﬄer showed in the late nineteenth century that
one has to subtract special terms, which are called subtractions by physicists.
The subtractions force the convergence of the inﬁnite series.
This is the prototype of the method of iteratively adding subtractions in the
Bogoliubov–Parasiuk–Hepp–Zimmermann (BPHZ) approach to renormaliza-
tion theory. The corresponding iterative algorithm (called the Bogoliubov
R-operation) has to be constructed carefully (because of nasty overlapping
divergences). This was done by Nikolai Bogoliubov in the 1950s. An ingenious
explicit solution formula for this iterative method was found by Wolfhart Zim-
mermann in 1969. This is the famous Zimmermann forest formula. In the
late 1990s, it was discovered by Dirk Kreimer that the sophisticated combi-
natorics of the Zimmermann forest formula can be understood best in terms
of a Hopf algebra generated by Feynman diagrams. By this discovery, the
modern formulation of the BPHZ approach is based on both Hopf algebras
and Rota–Baxter algebras.
As a warmup, in Chapter 3, we give an introduction to the modern com-
binatorial theory, which was founded by Gian-Carlo Rota (MIT, Cambridge,
Massachusetts) in the 1960s. This includes both Hopf algebras and Rota–
Baxter algebras.
Surprisingly enough, it turns out that the Zimmermann forest for-
mula is closely related to methods developed by Lagrange in the eigh-
teenth century when studying the solution of the Kepler equation for
the motion of planets in celestial mechanics.
In modern terminology, the Lagrange inversion formula for power series ex-
pansions is based on the so-called Fa`a di Bruno Hopf algebra.1 This will be
studied in Sect. 3.4.3.
1 The Italian priest and mathematician Francesco Fa`a di Bruno (1825–1888) was
beatiﬁed in 1988.

Preface
In physics, symmetries are basic. For describing symmetries in terms of
mathematics, there are two approaches based on
• groups and
• Hopf algebras.
In 1941, Heinz Hopf wanted to compute the cohomology of topological groups.
Hopf discovered that the cohomology ring of topological groups is equipped
with an additional structure which is called a Hopf algebra structure today.
This additional algebraic structure is based on the notion of the coproduct.
Roughly speaking, the concept of Hopf algebra is dual to the concept of
group. Hopf algebras are intimately related to quantum groups. We will show
in Chapter 3 that:
The product and the coproduct of a Hopf algebra model the fusion
and the splitting of objects (e.g., elementary particles), respectively.
In terms of analysis, the algebra of linear diﬀerential operators with constant
coeﬃcients can be equipped with the structure of a Hopf algebra. Here,
• the coproduct is related to the Leibniz product rule of diﬀerentiation, and
• the coinverse (also called the antipode) is related to the integration-by-parts
formula (see Sect. 3.3.1).
The integration-by-parts formula is a special case of the general Stokes inte-
gral theorem, which lies at the heart of the duality between homology and
cohomology in topology. This duality plays a key role for the mathematical
description of processes in nature. In particular, cohomology is deeply rooted
in Maxwell’s theory of electrodynamics (see Sect. 4.4.7).
Incredible cancellations. When doing computations in renormalization
theory, as a big surprise, physicists and mathematicians encounter incredible
cancellations of a large amount of terms. This dramatically simpliﬁes the
ﬁnal result. In terms of mathematics, a sophisticated combinatorics is behind
these cancellations. The prototype for this is given by the Fa`a di Bruno Hopf
algebra mentioned above.
The language of modern mathematics. We do not assume that the
reader of this series of monographs is familiar with the language used in mod-
ern mathematics. In this connection, we want to help the reader. For example,
many notions in advanced mathematics and hence in modern mathematical
physics are based on mathematical operations applied to equivalence classes.
For example, this concerns
• the construction of quantum states as equivalence classes of elements of Hilbert
spaces (and the relation to projective geometry),
• the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal (GNS) construction for representing the elements of
an abstract C∗-algebra as observables on a Hilbert space (the algebraic approach
to quantum theory),
• the Wightman reconstruction theorem for axiomatically deﬁned quantum ﬁelds
(via the GNS-construction),

• moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces (modulo conformal equivalence) and physical
states in string theory.
This leads to quotient spaces in algebra, analysis, geometry, and topology,
which will be encountered again and again in this series of monographs (e.g.,
homology groups, cohomology groups, homotopy groups, and K-theory in
topology). Chapter 4 serves as an introduction to quotient structures in math-
ematics and physics. The idea of the quotient ring (modulo a ﬁxed integer)
can be traced back at least to the Disquisitiones arithmeticae written by the
young Gauss (1777–1855) in 1801.2 In order to give the reader a feel for the
usefulness of working with equivalence classes, we will consider the following
examples:
• Gaussian quotient rings (modulo a prime number) and coding theory (as warmup
for quantum information),
• quotient ﬁelds and Heaviside’s symbolic method in electrical engineering (the
Mikusi´nski operational calculus),
• physical ﬁelds, observers, bundles, and cocycles,
• deformation, mapping classes, and topological charges,
• loop spaces and higher homotopy groups,
• the projective and the injective limit of mathematical structures (e.g., topological
spaces), and
• the rigorous approach to Leibniz’s inﬁnitesimals via ultraﬁlters (nonstandard
analysis).
For the foundation of nonstandard analysis, one needs the construction of
ultraﬁlers via Zorn’s lemma based on the axiom of choice in set theory.
The language of theoretical physics. Chapters 5 through 9 are devoted
to the basic ideas of
• classical geometric optics,
• classical mechanics, and
• quantum mechanics.
Here, we want to help mathematicians who are not familiar with theoretical
physics. In Chapter 5, we study Carath´eodory’s royal road to geometrical
optics based on the fundamental duality between
• light rays and
• wave fronts
which can be traced back to the work of Huygens in the seventeenth cen-
tury. In string theory, K¨ahler manifolds play a crucial role. In Chapter 5, we
will show how Poincar´e’s non-Euclidean geometry on the upper half-plane is
related to both geometrical optics and K¨ahler geometry.
2 The enormous inﬂuence of Gauss’ ﬁrst masterpiece on the development of math-
ematics is described in the monograph by C. Goldstein, N. Schappacher, and J.

Preface
Since all the models of quantum ﬁelds are based on the study of an inﬁnite
number of (slightly perturbed) harmonic oscillators in the setting of pertur-
bation theory, we use the harmonic oscillator as a paradigm for both classical
mechanics and quantum mechanics. In Chapter 6 on classical mechanics, we
will study the following topics:
• Newtonian mechanics,
• Lagrangian mechanics (the Euler–Lagrange equation, the Jacobi accessory eigen-
value problem and Morse theory),
• Hamiltonian mechanics (the canonical dynamical system and the Hamilton–
Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation), and
• Poissonian mechanics.
In particular, this concerns
• the Legendre transformation and contact geometry,
• the Hamiltonian ﬂow and symplectic geometry,
• the tangent bundle of the position space (the position-velocity space also called
the state space),
• the cotangent bundle of the position space (the position-momentum space also
called the phase space),
• the Legendre transformation as a transformation from the tangent bundle to the
cotangent bundle; the latter is equipped with a natural symplectic structure.
In terms of mathematics, the fundamental relation between symmetry and
conservation laws in physics is related to
• the Noether theorem, and
• Poisson brackets and Lie’s momentum map.
Quantum mechanics. The comprehensive Chapter 7 lies at the heart of
this series of monographs. This chapter should help the reader to understand
the diﬀerent aspects of the passage from classical physics to quantum physics,
by using the diﬀerent procedures of quantization. We will use the paradigm
of the harmonic oscillator in order to explain the basic ideas of the following
approaches:
• Heisenberg’s quantum mechanic (via creation and annihilation operators),
• Schr¨odinger’s quantum mechanics (via the Schr¨odinger partial diﬀerential equa-
tion),
• Feynman’s quantum mechanics (via the path integral),
• von Neumann’s functional-analytic approach (via the spectral theory for self-
adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces),
• von Neumann’s density operator in statistical physics (via trace class operators),
• Weyl’s symbolic calculus for pseudo-diﬀerential operators (deformation quanti-
zation),
• the Poincar´e–Wirtinger calculus and Bargmann’s holomorphic quantization,
• the Stone-von Neumann uniqueness theorem (for the fundamental commutation
relations in quantum mechanics) and the Weyl functor3 based on symplectic
geometry,
• supersymmetric quantization.
3 At this place, the general theory of mathematical structures (also called category
theory) enters the theory of quantization (also called quantum mathematics).

Preface
XV
Concerning the Feynman path integral as a fundamental tool in quantum
physics, we will study the following:
• Brownian motion and the inﬁnite-dimensional rigorous Wiener integral based on
measure theory,
• the rigorous Feynman–Kac formula for diﬀusion processes,
• rigorous ﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals, the computation of correlations
and moments, the Wick theorem, and Feynman diagrams,
• rigorous deﬁnition of inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals via zeta function
regularization,
• the Wentzel–Kramers–Brioullin (WKB) method of stationary phase for the com-
putation of Gaussian integrals, and the approximate computation of Feynman
path integrals.
The Feynman path integral can be obtained from the Wiener integral by
using formal analytic continuation from real time to imaginary time. This
corresponds to the fact that the Schr¨odinger equation describes diﬀusion
processes in imaginary time. Furthermore, in Chapter 7, we discuss the basic
ideas of the algebraic approach to quantum mechanics by using C∗-algebras
and von Neumann algebras. In this connection, we consider:
• applications to statistical mechanics (Boltzmann statistics, Bose–Einstein statis-
tics, and Fermi–Dirac statistics),
• thermodynamic equilibrium states (Kubo–Martin–Schwinger (KMS) states) and
the Tomita–Takesaki theory for von Neumann algebras,
• the Murray–von Neumann classiﬁcation of factors in the theory of von Neumann
algebras,
• projection operators and the main theorem of quantum logic (Gleason’s extension
theorem for C∗-algebras).
The modern theory of operator algebras culminates in Alain Connes’s non-
commutative geometry, which represents the appropriate mathematical struc-
ture for a deeper understanding of the Standard Model in elementary particle
physics. This will be investigated in Volume IV on quantum mathematics.
For the interested reader, we refer to the following fundamental monograph:

and Motives, American Mathematical Society 2008.
Internet: http://www.math.fsu.edu/∼marcolli/bookjune4.pdf
Chapters 8 and 9 serve as an introduction to scattering theory, which plays
a crucial role in elementary particle physics. As a paradigm for general scat-
tering theory, we consider the scattering of a quantum particle on the real
line. We consider
• the energy levels of bound states,
• the energy levels of scattering states, and distributions as generalized eigenfunc-
tions of the Schr¨odinger equation,
• the transition matrix,
• the unitary S-matrix and transition probabilities for scattering processes,
• the relation between the singularities of the S-matrix in the complex energetic
plane and the energy levels of stable bound states,

XVI
Preface
• unstable particles (resonances) and the second sheet of the energetic Riemann
surface (the Breit–Wigner formula for the energy levels and the mean lifetime of
resonances),
• stationary scattering theory, the Green’s function of the Helmholtz equation, and
the Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation,
• instationary scattering theory, wave operators, the absolutely continuous spec-
trum of the Hamiltonian, and the S-matrix in functional analysis.
Here, we do not assume that the reader is familiar with
• von Neumann’s functional-analytic spectral theory for self-adjoint operators in
Hilbert spaces,
• the Gelfand–Kostyuchenko theory of generalized eigenfunctions for self-adjoint
operators,
• the Møller–Kato theory of wave operators in scattering theory, and
• the Weyl–Kodaira theory for singular diﬀerential operators.
For the convenience of the reader, the necessary material will be summarized
at the proper place when it is needed in Volumes II and III.
Quantum electrodynamics. In the present volume, it is our main goal to
illustrate the beauty of quantum electrodynamics by proceeding pragmati-
cally.
We do not start with an abstract approach, but with the computa-
tion of important physical eﬀects which are observed in experiments,
including radiative corrections in lowest order of renormalization the-
ory.
This should help the reader in getting a feel for the essential questions. More
sophisticated approaches are postponed to later volumes of this series of
monographs. In the introductory Chapter 10, we study creation and anni-
hilation operators for electrons, positrons, and photons. In Chapter 11, we
formulate the classical ﬁeld equations of quantum electrodynamics on the in-
teraction between electrons and photons, by coupling the Maxwell equations
of the electromagnetic ﬁeld to the Dirac equation of the electron wave func-
tion. This equation depends on the gauge ﬁxing of the four-potential for the
electromagnetic ﬁeld. However, it turns out that physical eﬀects measured in
experiments are independent of the choice of the gauge ﬁxing. The point is
that:
The classical ﬁeld equations of quantum electrodynamics have to be
quantized.
In this connection, we have to distinguish between
• the single free quantum ﬁelds for electrons, positrons, and photons, and
• the total interacting quantum ﬁeld for electrons, positrons, and photons.
In Chapter 12, we construct free quantum ﬁelds by using the method of
Fourier quantization based on creation and annihilation operators.
In Chapter 13, we study the interacting quantum ﬁeld of electrons,
positrons, and photons by using

• the magic Dyson formula for the S-matrix (scattering matrix), and
• the main Wick theorem for the S-matrix, which implies the Feynman diagrams.
This is Dyson’s classical approach to understanding the Feynman diagrams.4
Originally, Feynman invented his exciting diagram technique on the basis of
ingenious physical intuition. In Dyson’s mathematical setting, the Feynman
diagrams are nothing other than graphical representations of well-deﬁned an-
alytic expressions, which are eﬀectively produced by the main Wick theorem.
Feynman’s use of propagators and Dyson’s magic formula for the S-matrix
are closely related to Lagrange’s variation-of-parameter formula in celestial
mechanics. Many mathematicians complain about the following situation:
In the physics textbooks, one reads the Feynman rules for Feynman
diagrams, but it is not clear where the Feynman rules come from.
In the present textbook, we will thoroughly study the mathematical and
physical origin of both the Feynman diagrams and the Feynman rules. We
will also consider applications to interesting physical eﬀects.
In Chapter 15, we investigate the following physical eﬀects in lowest order
of perturbation theory:
• the cross section for Compton scattering between photons and electrons (im-
provement of the Thomson formula in classical electrodynamics),
• the cross section for the scattering of electrons in an external electromagnetic
ﬁeld,
• the intensity of spectral lines for bound states in an external electromagnetic
ﬁeld, and
• the Cherenkov radiation.
For the computation of terms corresponding to higher order of perturba-
tion theory, renormalization theory is needed. In Chapter 17, we discuss the
physics behind the following radiative corrections in lowest possible order of
renormalization theory:
• the screening of the Coulomb potential by vacuum polarization (the Uehling
potential),
• the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (the Schwinger formula),
• the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and
• the Lamb shift in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom.
Unfortunately, the explicit computations (in the framework of dimensional
regularization in renormalization theory) are lengthy. We will postpone these
detailed computations to Volume III.
In Chapter 18, we discuss the main result telling us that quantum elec-
trodynamics can be renormalized to all orders of perturbation theory. The
ﬁnal result consists of getting ﬁnite expressions in each order of perturbation
theory (e.g., cross sections for scattering processes), which depend on the two
fundamental free parameters
4 Dyson’s discovery of this approach is described by himself in his book, F. Dyson,
Disturbing the Universe, Harper & Row, New York, 1979 (see page 27 of Volume
I for this fascinating story).

• meﬀ(eﬀective mass of the electron) and
• −eeﬀ(eﬀective electric charge of the electron).
Observe the crucial fact that:
The free parameters meﬀand eeﬀcannot be determined theoretically
by quantum electrodynamics.
They have to be determined by physical experiments. In the SI system, one
obtains the following values:
meﬀ= 0.511 MeV/c2,
eeﬀ= 1.602 · 10−19 As.
A reader who wants to become familiar with quantum electrodynamics as
quickly as possible should start reading with Chapter 10.
The incredible eﬀectiveness of perturbation theory in physics. Sur-
prisingly enough, low-order radiative corrections are suﬃcient for getting a
fantastic coincidence between theory and experimental data. For example,
the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron measured in experiments is
predicted very precisely by fourth-order radiative corrections (up to 9 digits).
However, the necessary amount of computations is enormous. One has to eval-
uate high-dimensional integrals which correspond to 891 Feynman diagrams;
this needs years of supercomputer time.
A warning to the reader. In summer 1976, Arthur Wightman (Princeton
University) organized a famous conference in Erice (Sicily/Italy) on renor-
malization theory. In the introduction to the Proceedings of this conference,
he writes:5
Renormalization theory is a notoriously complicated and technical sub-
ject. . . I want to tell stories with a moral for the earnest student: Renor-
malization theory has a history of egregious errors by distinguished savants
(see page 967). It has a justiﬁed reputation for perversity; a method that
works up to 13th order in the perturbation theory fails in the 14th order.
Arguments that sound plausible often dissolve into mush when examined
closely. The worst that can happen often happens. The prudent student
would do well to distinguish sharply between what has been proved and
what has been plausible, and in general he should watch out!
In 1999 Gerardus ’t Hooft and Martinus Veltman were awarded the Nobel
prize in physics for their contributions to the renormalization of the theory
of electroweak interaction and for the computation of radiative corrections in
the Standard Model of particle physics.
Perspectives. More advanced approaches to renormalization theory will be
systematically studied in the following volumes of this series of monographs.
In particular, this concerns the new approaches to perturbative quantum ﬁeld
theory due to Connes and Kreimer (Hopf algebras), and Brunetti, D¨utsch,

and Fredenhagen (microlocal analysis and the Master Ward Identity). In
order to give the reader an overview on the large variety of diﬀerent ap-
proaches to renormalization theory, we summarize important references in
Section 19.11, and in Chapter 19 we sketch some basic ideas.
The propagation of light in the universe, namely,
• the deﬂection of light at the sun, and
• the red shift of spectral lines as a consequence of the expansion of the universe
(the Hubble eﬀect)
will be investigated in Volume III in terms of Einstein’s theory of general
relativity.
The basic idea of our approach to quantum electrodynamics. As a
rule, mathematicians have trouble with reading some textbooks on quantum
ﬁeld theory written by physicists. The point is that:
In mathematics, one never does computations with quantities which
do not exist.6
In order to respect this basic principle in mathematics, we will use the lattice
approach. That is, roughly speaking, we will proceed in the following two
steps.
Step 1: The discretized physical system. We put the physical system in a cubic
box of ﬁnite side length L and volume V = L3. The boundary conditions are
given by periodicity.
• We observe the physical system in a ﬁnite time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ].
• We choose a maximal energy Emax.
• In the 3-dimensional momentum space, we introduce a ﬁnite lattice of spacing
Δp and maximal momentum Pmax. In this setting, the Fourier integral transform
is replaced by a discrete Fourier transform via ﬁnite Fourier series expansions.
• We deﬁne Dyson’s S-matrix for this situation.
• The main Wick theorem allows us to compute the S-matrix elements (i.e., the
transition amplitudes) in an elegant manner, by eliminating the creation and
annihilation operators, and replacing them by propagators (i.e., correlation func-
tions for free ﬁelds).
• The point is that the propagators are discrete algebraic Feynman integrals, which
are indeed well-deﬁned ﬁnite sums.
• The transition amplitudes can be graphically represented by Feynman diagrams.
• The Feynman rules allow us to translate the Feynman diagrams into well-deﬁned
ﬁnite sums.
• From the transition amplitudes, we obtain the transition probabilities which
yield the cross sections for scattering processes. Note that cross sections can be
measured in particle accelerators.
Step 2: The delicate continuum limit. Explicitly, we have to study the follow-
ing limits:
• L →∞(the volume L3 of the cubic box becomes inﬁnite),
6 For example, this concerns inﬁnite renormalization constants or ill-deﬁned
inﬁnite-dimensional functional/path integrals.

Preface
• T →∞(the time interval becomes inﬁnite),
• Pmax →∞(i.e., Emax →∞) (high-energy limit),
• Δp →0 (low-energy limit).
In order to force the convergence of the discrete algebraic Feynman integrals
to well-deﬁned expressions, we modify the classical Lagrangian density by
setting
meﬀ:= me + δm,
eeﬀ:= e + δe.
That is, we replace the so-called bare electron mass me and the so-called bare
electron charge −e in the Lagrangian density by
me = meﬀ−δm,
−e = −eeﬀ+ δe,
respectively. This way, the classical Lagrangian density
L(ψ, ∂ψ, A, ∂A; me, e)
is modiﬁed by the function
Lmodiﬁed(ψ, ∂ψ, A, ∂A; meﬀ, eeﬀ; δm, δe).
The terms multiplied by δm, δe are called counterterms of the classical La-
grangian density L. Note that in this lattice approach, δe and δm are real
parameters which depend on the shape of the lattice, that is, they depend on
the maximal energy Emax. Now consider the high-energy limit
Emax →+∞.
Roughly speaking, we have to show that δm(Emax) and δe(Emax) can be
chosen in such a way that the ﬁnite continuum limit exists for the S-matrix
elements (i.e., the transition elements). This is the procedure of renormaliza-
tion.
Observe the following peculiarity. By the Stone–von Neumann uniqueness
theorem, a ﬁnite number of creation and annihilation operators is uniquely
determined by the commutation relations (up to unitary equivalence). This is
not true anymore for an inﬁnite number of creation and annihilation opera-
tors, as was shown by Lars G˚arding and Arthur Wightman in 1954. However,
our approach avoids the latter ambiguity, since we only work with a ﬁnite
number of creation and annihilation operators before passing to the contin-
uum limit (of the vacuum expectation values). We also would like to empha-
size that our approach diﬀers only slightly from the usual approach used by
physicists. In particular, we use a notation for discrete Fourier integrals such
that the formal passage to the language used by physicists is possible at each
stage of our procedure.
For the physical quantities which can be measured in experiments,
our ﬁnal formulas coincide with the formulas used by physicists.

Moreover, in each step of our procedure it is easy to pass formally to the
expressions used by physicists, since the Feynman diagrams are the same.
This way, we hope to help mathematicians in getting a better under-
standing for the ingenious and beautiful approach invented by physi-
cists.
From the physical point of view, the modiﬁcation of the classical Lagrangian
density reﬂects the fact that:
Quantum eﬀects have to be added to the classical theory.
Intuitively, this means that the quantum ﬂuctuations of the ground state
of the quantum ﬁeld of electrons, positrons, and photons inﬂuence physical
eﬀects observed in experiments. For example, this concerns the anomalous
magnetic moment of the electron and the spectrum of the hydrogen atom
(Lamb shift).
Convention. If we do not expressively state the opposite, we will use the SI
system of physical units (international system of units) which can be found
in the Appendix to Volume I. In particular, note that in Chapters 10–19
on quantum electrodynamics, we will use the energetic system with c = 1
(velocity of light in a vacuum), ℏ= h/2π = 1 (Planck’s quantum of action),
k = 1 (Boltzmann constant), ε0 = μ0 = 1 (see page 790).
The Poincar´e Seminar. The best way of getting information about re-
cent developments in modern physics is to look at the books which report
the lectures given at the Poincar´e Seminar in Paris. Starting in 2002, this
seminar has been organized by l’Institut Henri Poincar´e in Paris (see page
1050). Bertrand Duplantier and Vincent Rivasseau write in the Foreword to
Quantum Spaces, Birkh¨auser, Basel, 2007:
This book is the seventh in a series of lectures of the S´eminaire Poincar´e,
which is directed towards a large audience of physicists and mathemati-
cians.
The goal of this seminar is to provide up-to-date information about gen-
eral topics of great interest in physics. Both the theoretical and experimen-
tal aspects are covered, with some historical background. Inspired by the
S´eminaire Bourbaki in mathematics in its organization, hence nicknamed
“S´eminaire Bourbaphy,” the Poincar´e Seminar is held twice a year at the
Institut Henri Poincar´e in Paris, with contributions prepared in advance.
Particular care is devoted to the pedagogical nature of the presentation so
as to fulﬁll the goal of being readable by a large audience of scientists.
Two recent survey volumes. The following two volumes try to reﬂect
the state of the art by summarizing the most important approaches used in
modern quantum ﬁeld theory:
• B. Fauser, J. Tolksdorf, and E. Zeidler (Eds.), Quantum Gravity: Mathematical
Models and Experimental Bounds, Birkh¨auser, Basel, 2006.
• B. Fauser, J. Tolksdorf, and E. Zeidler (Eds.), Quantum Field Theory – Com-
petitive Methods, Birkh¨auser, Basel, 2008.

Preface
Acknowledgements. I am very grateful to my collaborators Bertfried
Fauser and J¨urgen Tolksdorf for organizing two workshops in 2005 and 2007
on recent developments in quantum ﬁeld theory, and for both doing an ex-
cellent editorial job and telling me new research strategies and new results
in the algebraic and geometric approach to quantum ﬁeld theory. In partic-
ular, I would like to thank Bertfried Fauser for drawing my attention to the
relation between quantum ﬁeld theory and the following topics: Gian-Carlo
Rota’s work on combinatorics, the ubiquitous Hopf algebras, Rota–Baxter
algebras, quantum Cliﬀord algebras, the Rota–Stein cliﬀordization process,
Littlewood’s work on the representation theory of the symmetric group, mo-
tivic number theory, topos theory, and category theory in algebraic geometry.
For illuminating discussions about promising new approaches to (perturba-
tive) quantum ﬁeld theory in both ﬂat and curved space-time, I would like
to thank Klaus Fredenhagen and the late Julius Wess, as well as Detlev
Buchholz, Christian Brouder, Romeo Brunetti, Michael D¨utsch, Kurusch
Ebrahimi-Fard, Joel Feldman, Felix Finster, Christian Fleischhack, Alessan-
dra Frabetti, Stefan Hollands, Harald Grosse, Jerzy Kijowski, Dirk Kreimer,
Elisabeth Kraus, Alexander Lange, Matilde Marcolli, Mario Paschke, Klaus
Rehren, Gerd Rudolph, Manfred Salmhofer, Alexander Schmidt, Klaus Si-
bold, Rainer Verch, Hartmut Wachter, and Raimar Wulkenhaar.
I would like to thank Thomas Hahn from the Max Planck Institute for
Physics, Werner Heisenberg, in Munich for informing me on the state of the
art in automated multi-loop computations in perturbation theory. Such so-
phisticated computer programs are used for preparing the experiments at the
LHC (Large Hadron Collider) of CERN (European Organization for Nuclear
Research at Geneva, Switzerland) (see Sect. 18.4).
On the occasion of Professor Friedrich Hirzebruch’s 80th birthday on Oc-
tober 17 in 2007, I would like to dedicate this volume to him in gratitude. His
scientiﬁc work deeply inﬂuenced the development of mathematics in the sec-
ond half of the twentieth century. Nowadays physicists frequently use Hirze-
bruch’s results in order to study the topological structure of physical ﬁelds.
In 1982, Friedrich Hirzebruch founded the Max Planck Institute for Math-
ematics in Bonn (Germany). Mathematicians from all over the world enjoy
doing research in the relaxed and highly stimulating atmosphere of this insti-
tute. In 1996, the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the Sciences was
founded in Leipzig. Friedrich Hirzebruch was the chairman of the Founders’
Committee. The staﬀand the visitors of our institute are very grateful to
Professor Hirzebruch for his eﬀorts made as chairman.
For helping me to save a lot of time, I am very grateful to my secretary
Regine L¨ubke (invaluable support), Katarzyna Baier (answering patiently
almost inﬁnitely many bibliographical questions), the library team (steadily
support), Kerstin F¨olting (graphics and tables), Micaela Krieger-Hauwede
(answering patiently my LATEX questions), Katrin Scholz (internet searching),
and Thomas Heid (computer expert). I also would like to thank the staﬀof

the Springer publishing house in Heidelberg, Ruth Allewelt, Joachim Heinze,
and Martin Peters, for the harmonious collaboration. Many years ago, my
Czech colleague from Prague, the late Svatopluk Fuˇcik, wrote the following
sentence in the preface to his book on nonlinear partial diﬀerential equations:
“Finally, I would like to thank myself for typing the manuscript.” I resist the
temptation of repeating this sentence with respect to my LATEX ﬁle. But I
would like to thank Donald Knuth for enjoying the mathematical community
with the beautiful gift of the TEX tool.
In the Proverbs 31, 10 of the Bible, one reads:
Who can ﬁnd a virtuous woman? For her price is far above rubies. The
heart of her husband does safely trust in her, so that he shall have no need
of spoil. She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
I am very grateful to my beloved wife, Christine, who has been taking care
of me for 40 years.

Prologue
One thing I have learned in a long life: that all our science, measured
against reality, is primitive and childlike – and yet it is the most precise
thing we have.
Albert Einstein (1879–1955)
The development of quantum mechanics in the years 1925 and 1926 had
produced rules for the description of systems of microscopic particles,
which involved promoting the fundamental dynamical variables of a corre-
sponding classical system into operators with speciﬁed commutators. By
this means, a system, described initially in classical particle language, ac-
quires characteristics associated with the complementary classical wave
picture. It was also known that electromagnetic radiation contained in an
enclosure, when considered as a classical dynamical system, was equiva-
lent energetically to a denumerably inﬁnite number of harmonic oscillators.
With the application of the quantization process to these ﬁctitious oscil-
lators, the classical radiation ﬁeld assumed characteristics describable in
the complementary classical particle language. The ensuing theory of light
quantum emission and absorption by atomic systems7 marked the begin-
ning of quantum electrodynamics. . .
When it was attempted to quantize the complete electromagnetic ﬁeld,8
diﬃculties were encountered that stem from the gauge ambiguity of the
potentials that appear in the Lagrangian formulation of the Maxwell equa-
tions. . .
From the origin of quantum electrodynamics, in the classical theory of
point charges, came a legacy of diﬃculties.9 The coupling of an electron
with the electromagnetic ﬁeld implied an inﬁnite displacement, and, in-
deed, an inﬁnite shift of all spectral lines emitted by an atomic system;10

Prologue
in the reaction of the electromagnetic ﬁeld stimulated by the presence
of the electron, arbitrary short wave lengths play a disproportionate and
divergent role. The phenomenon of electron-positron pair creation, which
ﬁnds a natural place in the relativistic electron ﬁeld theory, contributes to
this situation in virtue of the ﬂuctuating densities of charge and current
that occur even in the vacuum state11 as the matter-ﬁeld counterpart of
the ﬂuctuations in electric and magnetic ﬁeld strengths.12
In computing the energy of a single electron relative to that of the vacuum
state, it is of signiﬁcance that the presence of the electron tends to suppress
the charge-current ﬂuctuations induced by the ﬂuctuating electromagnetic
ﬁeld. The resulting electron energy, while still divergent in its dependence
upon the contributions of arbitrarily short wave lengths exhibits only a
logarithmic inﬁnity;13 the combination of quantum and relativistic eﬀects
has destroyed all correspondence with the classical theory and its strongly
structured-dependent electromagnetic mass.
The existence of current ﬂuctuations in the vacuum has other implica-
tions, since the introduction of an electromagnetic ﬁeld induces currents
that tend to modify the initial ﬁeld; the “vacuum” acts as a polarizable
medium.14
New nonlinear electromagnetic phenomena appear, such as the scattering
of one light beam by another, or by an electrostatic ﬁeld. . .
It is not likely that future developments will change drastically the prac-
tical results of the electron theory, which gives contemporary quantum
electrodynamics a certain enduring value. Yet the real signiﬁcance of the
work of the past decade lies in the recognition of the ultimate problems
facing electrodynamics, the problems of conceptual consistency and of phys-
ical completeness. No ﬁnal solution can be anticipated until physical sci-
ence has met the heroic challenge to comprehend the structure of the
sub-microscopic world that nuclear exploration has revealed.15
Julian Schwinger, 1958
This quotation is taken from a beautiful collection of 34 papers which played
a fundamental role in the development of quantum electrodynamics. This
volume was edited by Julian Schwinger from Harvard University who himself
made fundamental contributions to this fascinating ﬁeld of contemporary
physics.
In the present volume, we will use Dyson’s extremely elegant approach to
quantum electrodynamics based on the Dyson series for the S-matrix (scat-
11 The ground state of a quantum ﬁeld is also called the vacuum state, by abuse of
language. Note that the vacuum state is full of physics. In particular, quantum
ﬂuctuations of the vacuum state cause the essential physical eﬀects observed in
physical experiments.

tering matrix). In the beginning of his Selected Papers, Freeman Dyson (born
1923) describes the history of quantum electrodynamics:16
My ﬁrst stroke of luck was to ﬁnd Nicholas Kemmer in Cambridge (Eng-
land) in 1946. He was the teacher I needed. He rapidly became a friend
as well as a teacher.17 Our friendship is still alive and well after 45 years.
Kemmer gave two courses of lectures in Cambridge, one on nuclear physics
and one on quantum ﬁeld theory. In 1946, the only existing text-book on
quantum ﬁeld theory was the book “Quantentheorie der Wellenfelder”, by
Gregor Wentzel (1898–1978) written in Z¨urich and published in 1943 in
Vienna in the middle of the war. Kemmer had been a student of Wentzel
and possessed a copy of Wentzel’s book. It was at that time a treasure
without price. I believe there were then only two copies in England. It was
later reprinted in America and translated into English.18 But in 1946, few
people in America knew of its existence and fewer considered it important.
Kemmer not only possessed a copy, he also lent it to me and explained
why it was important. . .
In 1947, I arrived at Cornell as a student and found myself, thanks to
Kemmer, the only person in the whole university who knew about quantum
ﬁeld theory. The great Hans Bethe (1906–2005) and the brilliant Richard
Feynman (1918–1988) taught me a tremendous lot about many areas of
physics, but when we were dealing with quantum ﬁeld theory, I was the
teacher and they were the students19 . . .
Julian Schwinger (1918–1994) had known about quantum ﬁeld theory long
before. But he shared the American view that it was a mathematical ex-
travagance, better avoided unless it should turn out to be essential. In 1948,
he understood that it could be useful. He used it for calculations of the
energy level shifts20 revealed by the experiments of Lamb and Retherford,

17 Nicholas Kemmer (1911–1998) was born in Saint Petersburg (Russia). In 1922,
his family moved to Germany. He studied at the University of G¨ottingen. In
1940, he moved to Trinity College, Cambridge (England), to work on the wartime
atomic energy project. He went to the University of Edinburgh from 1953–1979
as Tait Professor of Mathematical Physics, then Professor Emeritus. He was
elected F.R.S. (Fellow of the Royal Society) in 1956.

19 Hans Bethe was born in Strasbourg (Alsace) in 1906. He studied at the Uni-
versity of Frankfurt/Main (Germany), and he obtained his Ph.D. at the Uni-
versity of Munich in 1928. In 1934, he emigrated to the United States, and he
was appointed to a professorship at the Cornell University (Ithaca, New York).
From 1943 until 1946, he worked in Los Alamos (New Mexico) (the Manhattan
project for constructing the atomic bomb). In 1946, Bethe returned to Cornell
and brought with him a group of brilliant young experimental and theoreti-
cal physicists. Among them was Richard Feynman. In 1967, Hans Bethe was
awarded the Nobel prize in physics for his contributions to the theory of nuclear
reactions, especially his discoveries concerning the energy production in stars.

Prologue
Foley and Kusch at Columbia.21 But he used it grudgingly. In his publi-
cations, he preferred not to speak explicitly about quantum ﬁeld theory.
Instead, he spoke about Green’s Functions. It turned out that the Green’s
Functions that Schwinger talked about and the quantum ﬁeld theory that
Kemmer talked about were fundamentally the same thing. . .
At Cornell, I was learning Richard Feynman’s quite diﬀerent way of calcu-
lating atomic processes. Feynman had never been interested in quantum
ﬁeld theory. He had his own private way of doing calculations. His way
was based on things that he called “Propagators,” which were probabil-
ity amplitudes for particles to propagate themselves from one space-time
point to another. He calculated the probabilities of physical processes by
adding up the propagators. He had rules for calculating the propagators.
Each propagator was represented graphically by a collection of diagrams.
Each diagram gave a pictorial view of particles moving along straight lines
and colliding with one another at points where the straight lines met.
When I learned this technique of drawing diagrams and calculating prop-
agators from Feynman, I found it completely baﬄing, because it always
gave the right answer, but did not seem based on any solid mathemati-
cal foundation. Feynman called his way of calculating physical processes
“the space-time approach,” because his diagrams represented events as
occurring at particular places and at particular times. The propagators
described sequences of events in space and time. It later turned out that
Feynman’s propagators were merely another kind of Green’s Functions.
Feynman had been talking the language of Green’s Functions all his life
without knowing it.
Green’s Functions also appeared in the work of Sin-Itiro Tomonaga (1906–
1979), who had developed independently a new elegant version of relativis-
tic quantum ﬁeld theory. His work was done in the complete isolation of
war-time Japan, and was published in Japanese in 1943. The rest of the
world became aware of it only in the spring of 1948, when an English
translation of it arrived at Princeton sent by Hideki Yukawa (1907–1981)
to Robert Oppenheimer (1904–1967). Tomonaga was a physicist in the
European tradition, having worked as a student with Heisenberg (1901–
1976) at Leipzig before the war. For him, in contrast to Schwinger and
Feynman, quantum ﬁeld theory was a familiar and natural language in
which to think.
After the war, Tomonaga’s students had been applying his ideas to calcu-
late the properties of atoms and electrons with high accuracy, and were
reaching the same results as Schwinger and Feynman. When Tomonaga’s
papers began to arrive in America, I was delighted to see that he was
speaking the language of quantum ﬁeld theory that I had learned from
Kemmer. It did not take us long to put the various ingredients of the pud-
ding together. When the pudding was cooked, all three versions of the new
theory of atoms and electrons turned out to be diﬀerent ways of express-
ing the same basic idea. The basic idea was to calculate Green’s Functions
for all atomic processes that could be directly observed. Green’s Functions
appeared as the essential link between the methods of Schwinger and Feyn-
man, and Tomonaga’s relativistic quantum ﬁeld theory provided the ﬁrm
mathematical foundation for all three versions of quantum electrodynam-
ics.

Dyson wrote two fundamental papers on the foundations of quantum elec-
trodynamics, which are now classics:
F. Dyson, The radiation theories of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman,
Phys. Rev. 75 (1949), 486–502.
F. Dyson, The S-matrix in quantum electrodynamics, Phys. Rev. 75
(1949), 1736–1755.
The fascinating story of the ﬁrst paper can be found on page 27 of Vol. I.
Dyson’s second paper on renormalization theory starts as follows:
The covariant (i.e., relativistically invariant) quantum electrodynamics of
Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman is used as the basis for a general treat-
ment of scattering problems involving electrons, positrons, and photons.
Scattering processes, including the creation and annihilation of particles,
are completely described by the S-matrix (scattering matrix) of Heisen-
berg.22 It is shown that the elements of this matrix can be calculated by
a consistent use of perturbation theory to any order in the ﬁne-structure
constant. Detailed rules are given for carrying out such calculations, and
it is shown that divergences arising from higher order radiative corrections
can be removed from the S-matrix by a consistent use of the ideas of mass
and charge renormalization.
Not considered in this paper are the problems of extending the treatment
to bound-state phenomena, and of proving the convergence of the theory
as the order of perturbation itself tends to inﬁnity.23
In 1950, John Ward published a short note where he used a highly formal
argument in order to get a speciﬁc identity:24
It has been recently proved by Dyson that all divergences in the S-matrix
may be removed by a renormalization of mass and charge. Dyson deﬁnes
certain fundamental divergent operators Γμ, S′
F , D′
F and gives a procedure
for their ﬁnite parts Γμ1, S′

tion. It is then shown that

where Z1, Z2, and Z3 are certain inﬁnite constants and e1 is the (ﬁnite)
renormalized electronic charge. Dyson conjectured that Z1 = Z2 and it is
proposed here to give a formal proof of this relation.

Prologue
Nowadays this identity is called the Ward identity; it is the prototype of
the crucial Ward–Takahashi–Slavnov–Taylor identities in gauge ﬁeld theo-
ries, which are consequences of (local) gauge symmetry. In quantum electro-
dynamics, the Ward identity guarantees the unitarity of the S-matrix; this
is a decisive ingredient of S-matrix theory. In fact, the unitarity is crucial for
relating elements of the S-matrix to transition probabilities (see Sect. 7.15 of
Vol. I). If the unitarity of the S-matrix is violated, then the theory becomes
meaningless from the physical point of view.
After thinking about the convergence problem in quantum electrodynam-
ics for a long time, Dyson published his paper Divergence of perturbation
theory in quantum electrodynamics, Phys. Rev. 85 (1952), 631–632. The ab-
stract of this paper reads as follows:
An argument is presented which leads tentatively to the conclusion that all
the power-series expansions currently in use in quantum electrodynamics
are divergent after the renormalization of mass and charge. The divergence
in no way restricts the accuracy of practical calculations that can be made
with the theory, but raises important questions of principle concerning the
nature of the physical concepts upon which the theory is built.
Dyson’s heuristic argument can be found in Sect. 15.5.1 of Vol. I. Silvan
Schweber writes the following in his excellent history on quantum elec-
trodynamics entitled QED and the Men Who Made It: Dyson, Feynman,
Schwinger, and Tomonaga, Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jer-
sey, 1994:25
The importance of Schwinger’s 1947 calculation of the anomalous magnetic
moment of the electron cannot be underestimated. In the course of theoret-
ical developments, there sometimes occur important calculations that alter
the way the community thinks about particular approaches. Schwinger’s
calculation is one such instance. . .
The papers of Tomonaga, Schwinger, and Feynman did not complete the
renormalization program since they conﬁned themselves to low order cal-
culations. It was Dyson who dared to face the problem of high orders
and brought the program to completion. In magniﬁcently penetrating pa-
pers, he pointed out and resolved the main problems of this very diﬃcult
analysis. . . Whatever the future may bring, it is safe to assert that the
theoretical advances made in the unravelling of the constitution of matter
since World War II comprise one of the greatest intellectual achievements
of mankind. They were based on the ground secured by the contributions
of Bethe, Tomonaga, Schwinger, Feynman, and Dyson to quantum ﬁeld
theory and renormalization theory in the period from 1946 to 1951.
For creating quantum electrodynamics, Richard Feynman, Julian Schwinger,
and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1965.

Elliott Lieb (Princeton University) writes the following in the foreword to
Dyson’s Selected Papers (reprinted with permission):
If any proof be needed that theoretical physics papers are not ephemeral
and are not written on a blackboard that has to be erased every ﬁve years,
then the papers in this volume will supply ample witness. The writings of
Freeman Dyson are among the jewels that crown the subject and today
even the earliest among them can be read with proﬁt and much pleasure
by beginners and experts. . .
Dyson along with Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga was a founder of
quantum electrodynamics. When I started my graduate studies in the
ﬁfties, it was not easy to ﬁnd a coherent pedagogical representation of
the new ﬁeld, but fortunately, Dyson had given lectures at Cornell in 1951
and these were available as notes. Thanks to their clarity many people,
including me, were able to enter the ﬁeld.
Recently, these classic notes were published:

Electrodynamics 1951, World Scientiﬁc, Singapore, 2007.
Feynman’s approach to quantum electrodynamics was elegantly based on
the use of graphs called Feynman diagrams today. David Kaiser writes the
following in his book Drawing Theories Apart: The Dispersion of Feynman
Diagrams in Postwar Physics (the University of Chicago Press, Chicago and

Prologue
For all of Feynman’s many contributions to modern physics, his diagrams
have had the widest and longest-lasting inﬂuence. Feynman diagrams have
revolutionized nearly every aspect of theoretical physics since the middle
of the twentieth century. Feynman ﬁrst introduced his diagrams in the
late 1940s as a bookkeeping device for simplifying lengthy calculations
in one area of physics – quantum electrodynamics, physicist’s quantum-
mechanical description of electromagnetic forces. Soon the diagrams gained
adherents throughout the ﬁelds of nuclear and particle physics. Not long
thereafter, other theorists adopted – and subtly adapted – Feynman dia-
grams for many-body applications in solid-state physics. By the end of the
1960s, some physicists even wielded the line drawings for calculations in
gravitational physics. With the diagrams’ aid, entire new calculational vis-
tas opened for physicists; theorists learned to calculate things that many
had barely dreamed possible before World War II. With the list of dia-
grammatic applications growing ever longer, Feynman diagrams helped to
transform the way physicists saw the world, and their place within it.
There is no doubt that quantum electrodynamics is one of the most beauti-
ful theories in theoretical physics. The following quotation is taken from the
forthcoming article “Quantum Theory and Relativity” written by Arthur
Jaﬀe, Contemporary Mathematics, American Mathematical Society, Provi-
dence, Rhode Island, 2008, pp. 209–245 (reprinted with permission):26
Two major themes dominated twentieth century physics: quantum theory
and relativity. These two fundamental principles provide the cornerstones
upon which one might build the understanding of modern physics. And to-
day after one century of elaboration of the original discoveries by Poincar´e,
Einstein, Bohr, Schr¨odinger, Heisenberg, Dirac – and many others – one
still dreams of describing the forces of nature within such an arena. Yet
we do not know the answer to the basic question:
Are quantum theory, relativity, and interaction mathematically compatible?
Even if one restricts relativity to special relativity, we do not know the
answer to this question about our four-dimensional world – much less about
other higher-dimensional worlds considered by string theorists.
Should quantum theory with relativity not qualify as logic? Physics sug-
gests that a natural way to combine quantum theory, special relativity and
interaction is through a nonlinear quantum ﬁeld. Enormous progress on
this problem has been made over the past forty years. This includes show-
ing that theories exist in space-times of dimension two and three. Building
this new mathematical framework and ﬁnding these examples has become
known as the subject of constructive quantum ﬁeld theory. . .
For centuries, the tradition in physics has been to describe natural phenom-
ena by mathematics. Eugene Wigner marveled on the relevance of mathe-
matics in his famous essay: “On the Unreasonable Eﬀectiveness of Mathe-
matics in the Natural Sciences,” Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 13 (1960), 1–14.
Intuition can go a long way. But by endowing physics with a mathematical
foundation, one also bestows physical laws with longevity. For mathemat-
ical ideas can be understood and conveyed more easily than conjectures,
both from person to person, and also from generation to generation.
26 I would like to thank Arthur Jaﬀe for sending me the electronic version of this
beautiful article before publishing it.

Prologue

In recent years, we have witnessed enormous progress in another direction –
of transferring ideas from physics to mathematics: to play on Wigner’s title,
concepts from physics have had an unreasonable eﬀectiveness in provid-
ing insight to formulate mathematical conjectures! The resulting infusion
of new perspectives has truly blossomed into a mathematical revolution,
which has been suﬃciently robust to touch almost every mathematical
frontier. . .

1. Mathematical Principles of Modern Natural
Philosophy
The book of nature is written in the language of mathematics.
Galileo Galilei (1564–1642)
At the beginning of the seventeenth century, two great philosophers, Fran-
cis Bacon (1561–1626) in England and Ren´e Descartes (1596–1650) in
France, proclaimed the birth of modern science. Each of them described
his vision of the future. Their visions were very diﬀerent. Bacon said, “All
depends on keeping the eye steadily ﬁxed on the facts of nature.” Descartes
said, “I think, therefore I am.” According to Bacon, scientists should travel
over the earth collecting facts, until the accumulated facts reveal how Na-
ture works. The scientists will then induce from the facts the laws that
Nature obeys. According to Descartes, scientists should stay at home and
deduce the laws of Nature by pure thought. In order to deduce the laws
correctly, the scientists will need only the rules of logic and knowledge of
the existence of God. For four hundred years since Bacon and Descartes led
the way, science has raced ahead by following both paths simultaneously.
Neither Baconian empiricism nor Cartesian dogmatism has the power to
elucidate Nature’s secrets by itself, but both together have been amaz-
ingly successful. For four hundred years English scientists have tended to
be Baconian and French scientists Cartesian.
Faraday (1791–1867) and Darwin (1809–1882) and Rutherford (1871–
1937) were Baconians; Pascal (1623–1662) and Laplace (1749–1827) and
Poincar´e (1854–1912) were Cartesians. Science was greatly enriched by the
cross-fertilization of the two contrasting national cultures. Both cultures
were always at work in both countries. Newton (1643–1727) was at heart
a Cartesian, using pure thought as Descartes intended, and using it to
demolish the Cartesian dogma of vortices. Marie Curie (1867–1934) was
at heart a Baconian, boiling tons of crude uranium ore to demolish the
dogma of the indestructibility of atoms.1
Freeman Dyson, 2004
It is important for him who wants to discover not to conﬁne himself to a
chapter of science, but keep in touch with various others.2

1. Mathematical Principles of Modern Natural Philosophy
Mathematics takes us still further from what is human, into the region of
absolute necessity, to which not only the actual world, but every possible
world must conform.3
Bertrand Russel (1872–1972)
1.1 Basic Principles
There exist the following fundamental principles for the mathematical de-
scription of physical phenomena in nature.
(I) The inﬁnitesimal principle due to Newton and Leibniz: The laws of nature
become simple on an inﬁnitesimal level of space and time.4
(II) The optimality principle (or the principle of least action): Physical pro-
cesses proceed in such an optimal way that the action is minimal (or at
least critical). Such processes are governed by ordinary or partial diﬀer-
ential equations called the Euler–Lagrange equations.
(III) Emmy Noether’s symmetry principle: Symmetries of the action func-
tional imply conservation laws for the corresponding Euler–Lagrange
equations (e.g., conservation of energy).
(IV) The gauge principle and Levi-Civita’s parallel transport: The funda-
mental forces in nature (gravitational, eletromagnetic, strong, and weak
interaction) are based on the symmetry of the action functional un-
der local gauge transformations. The corresponding parallel transport
of physical information generates the intrinsic Gauss–Riemann–Cartan–
Ehresmann curvature which, roughly speaking, corresponds to the acting
force (also called interaction). Brieﬂy: force = curvature.
(V) Planck’s quantization principle: Nature jumps.
(VI) Einstein’s principle of special relativity: Physics does not depend on the
choice of the inertial system.
(VII) Einstein’s principle of general relativity: Physics does not depend on
the choice of the local space-time coordinates of an observer.
(VIII) Dirac’s unitarity principle: Quantum physics does not depend on the
choice of the measurement device (i.e., on the choice of an orthonormal
basis in the relevant Hilbert space). This corresponds to the invariance
under unitary transformations.5

1.1 Basic Principles
13
Geometrization of physics. In mathematics, the properties of geomet-
ric objects do not depend on the choice of the coordinate system. This is
similar to the principles (VI)–(VIII). Therefore, it is quite natural that geo-
metric methods play a fundamental role in modern physics.
Linearity and nonlinearity. We have to distinguish between
(i) linear processes, and
(ii) nonlinear processes.
In case (i), the superposition principle holds, that is, the superposition of
physical states yields again a physical state. Mathematically, such processes
are described by linear spaces and linear operator equations. The mathe-
matical analysis can be simpliﬁed by representing physical phenomena as
superposition of simpler phenomena. This is the method of harmonic analy-
sis (e.g., the Fourier method based on the Fourier series, the Fourier integral,
or the Fourier–Stieltjes integral).
In case (ii), the superposition principle is violated. As a rule, interactions
in nature are mathematically described by nonlinear operator equations (e.g.,
nonlinear diﬀerential or integral equations). The method of perturbation the-
ory allows us to reduce (ii) to (i), by using an iterative method.
Basic properties of physical eﬀects. For the mathematical investiga-
tion of physical eﬀects, one has to take the following into account.
(A) Faraday’s locality principle: Physical eﬀects propagate locally in space
and time (law of proximity theory).
(B) Green’s locality principle: The response of a linear physical system can be
described by localizing the external forces in space and time and by con-
sidering the superposition of the corresponding special responses (method
of the Green’s function). Furthermore, this can be used for computing
nonlinear physical systems by iteration.
(C) Planck’s constant: The smallest action (energy × time) in nature is given
by the action quantum h = 6.626 0755 · 10−34Js.
(D) Einstein’s propagation principle: Physical eﬀects travel at most with the
speed of light c in a vacuum. Explicitly, c = 2.997 92458 · 108m/s.
(E) Gauge invariance principle: Physical eﬀects are invariant under local
gauge transformations. Physical experiments are only able to measure
quantities which do not depend on the choice of the gauge condition.

1. Mathematical Principles of Modern Natural Philosophy
(F) The Planck scale hypothesis: Physics dramatically changes below the
Planck length given by l = 10−35m.
In what follows, let us discuss some basic ideas related to all of the principles
summarized above. To begin with, concerning Faraday’s locality principle,
Maxwell emphasized the following:6
Before I began the study of electricity I resolved to read no mathematics on
the subject till I had ﬁrst read through Faraday’s 1832 paper Experimental
researches on electricity. I was aware that there was supposed to be a
diﬀerence between Faraday’s way of conceiving phenomena and that of
the mathematicians, so that neither he nor they were satisﬁed with each
other’s language. I had also the conviction that this discrepancy did not
arise from either party being wrong. For instance, Faraday, in his mind, saw
lines of force traversing all space where the mathematicians (e.g., Gauss)
saw centers of force attracting at a distance; Faraday saw a medium where
they saw nothing but distance; Faraday sought the seat of the phenomena
in real actions going on in the medium, where they were satisﬁed that they
had found it in a power of action at a distance impressed on the electric
ﬂuids.
When I had translated what I considered to be Faraday’s ideas into a
mathematical form, I found that in general the results of the two methods
coincide. . . I also found that several of the most fertile methods of research
discovered by the mathematicians could be expressed much better in terms
of the ideas derived from Faraday than in their original form.
1.2 The Inﬁnitesimal Strategy and Diﬀerential
Equations
Diﬀerential equations are the foundation of the natural scientiﬁc, mathe-
matical view of the world.
Vladimir Igorevich Arnold (born 1937)
The inﬁnitesimal strategy due to Newton and Leibniz studies the behavior of
a physical system for inﬁnitesimally small time intervals and inﬁnitesimally
small distances. This leads to the encoding of physical processes into diﬀeren-
tial equations (e.g., Newton’s equations of motion in mechanics, or Maxwell’s
equations in electrodynamics).
The task of mathematics is to decode this information; that is, to
solve the fundamental diﬀerential equations.
1.3 The Optimality Principle
It is crucial that the class of possible diﬀerential equations is strongly re-
stricted by the optimality principle. This principle tells us that the funda-
mental diﬀerential equations are the Euler–Lagrange equations to variational

problems. In 1918, Emmy Noether formulated her general symmetry princi-
ple in the calculus of variations. The famous Noether theorem combines Lie’s
theory of continuous groups with the calculus of variations due to Euler and
Lagrange. This will be studied in Section 6.6.
1.4 The Basic Notion of Action in Physics and the Idea
of Quantization
The most important physical quantity in physics is not the energy, but the
action which has the physical dimension energy times time. The following is
crucial.
(i) The fundamental processes in nature are governed by the principle of
least action
S = min!
where we have to add appropriate side conditions. In fact, one has to use
the more general principal S = critical! (principle of critical action). For
example, if we consider the motion q = q(t) of a particle of mass m on
the real line, then the action is given by
S[q] :=
 t1
t0
 1
2m ˙q(t)2 −U(q(t))

dt.
Here, the function U = U(q) is the potential, and the negative derivative,
−U ′, describes the acting force. In this case, the principle of critical action
reads as
S[q] = critical!,
q(t0) = q0, q(t1) = q1
(1.1)
where we ﬁx the following quantities: the initial time t0, the initial posi-
tion q0 of the particle, the ﬁnal time t1, and the ﬁnal position q1 of the
particle. The solutions of (1.1) satisfy the Euler–Lagrange equation
m¨q(t) = F(t),
t ∈R
with the force F(t) = −U ′(q(t)). This coincides with the Newtonian
equation of motion (see Sect. 6.5).
(ii) In 1900 Planck postulated that there do not exist arbitrarily small
amounts of action in nature. The smallest amount of action in nature
is equal to the Planck constant h. In ancient times, philosophers said:
Natura non facit saltus. (Nature does never make a jump.)
In his “Noveaux essais,” Leibniz wrote:
Tout va par degr´es dans la nature et rien par saut. (In nature
everything proceeds little by little and not by jumping.)

16
1. Mathematical Principles of Modern Natural Philosophy
In contrast to this classical philosophy, Planck formulated the hypothesis
in 1900 that the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator form a discrete set.
He used this fact in order to derive his radiation law for black bodies (see
Sect. 2.3.1 of Vol. I). This was the birth of quantum physics. More gen-
erally, the energy levels of the bound states of an atom or a molecule are
discrete. The corresponding energy jumps cause the spectra of atoms and
molecules observed in physical experiments (e.g., the spectral analysis of
the light coming from stars). Nowadays, we say that:
Nature jumps.
This reﬂects a dramatic change in our philosophical understanding of
nature.
(iii) In order to mathematically describe quantum eﬀects, one has to modify
classical theories. This is called the process of quantization, which we
will encounter in this series of monographs again and again. As an in-
troduction to this, we recommend reading Chapter 7. Now to the point.
Feynman discovered in the early 1940s in his dissertation in Princeton
that the process of quantization can be most elegantly described by path
integrals (also called functional integrals) of the form

eiS[ψ]/ℏDψ
where we sum over all classical ﬁelds ψ (with appropriate side conditions).
Here, ℏ:= h/2π. For example, the quantization of the classical particle
considered in (i) can be based on the formula
G(q0, t0; q1, t1) =

eiS[q]/ℏDq.
Here, we sum over all classical motions q = q(t) which satisfy the side
condition q(t0) = q0 and q(t1) = q1. The Green’s function G determines
the time-evolution of the wave function ψ, that is, if we know the wave
function ψ = ψ(x, t0) at the initial time t0, then we know the wave
function at the later time t by the formula
ψ(x, t) =

R
G(x, t; y, t0)ψ(y, t0)dy.
Finally, the wave function ψ tells us the probability
 b
a
|ψ(x, t)|2dx
of ﬁnding the quantum particle in the interval [a, b] at time t.

1.5 The Method of the Green’s Function
17
(iv) In quantum ﬁeld theory, one uses the functional integral

eiS[ψ]/ℏei⟨ψ|J⟩Dψ
with the additional external source J. Diﬀerentiation with respect to J
yields the moments of the quantum ﬁeld. In turn, the moments deter-
mine the correlation functions (also called Green’s functions). The cor-
relation functions describe the correlations between diﬀerent positions of
the quantum ﬁeld at diﬀerent points in time. These correlations are the
most important properties of the quantum ﬁeld which can be related to
physical measurements.
Feynman’s functional integral approach to quantum physics clearly shows
that both classical and quantum physics are governed by the classical action
functional S. This approach can also be extended to the study of many-
particle systems at ﬁnite temperature, as we have discussed in Sect. 13.8 of
Vol. I. Summarizing, let us formulate the following general strategy:
The main task in modern physics is the mathematical description of
the propagation of physical eﬀects caused by interactions and their
quantization.
In Sect. 1.9 we will show that in modern physics, interactions are described
by gauge theories based on local symmetries.
1.5 The Method of the Green’s Function
Basic ideas. As a prototype, consider the motion x = x(t) of a particle
of mass m > 0 on the real line under the action of the continuous force
F : R →R. The corresponding Newtonian equation of motion reads as
m¨x(t) = F(t)
for all
t ∈R
(1.2)
with the initial condition
x(0) = a,
˙x(0) = v.
We are given the initial position a and the initial velocity v at time t = 0.
For simplifying notation, we set m := 1. In order to discuss Green’s locality
principle in physics, let us summarize the following facts. The unique solution
of (1.2) reads as
x(t) = a + vt +
 t
0
(t −τ)F(τ)dτ
for all
t ∈R.
Equivalently, this can be written as

−∞
G(t, τ)F(τ)dτ
for all

(1.3)
The function G is called the Green’s function of the diﬀerential equation
(1.2). Explicitly,
G(t, τ) :=
⎧

⎨
⎪
⎩

if
0 ≤τ ≤t,

Let us discuss the physical meaning of the Green’s function G. To this end,
for ﬁxed positive number Δt and all times t ∈R, we introduce the Dirac
Δt-delta function
δΔt(t) :=
	
1
Δt
if
0 ≤t ≤Δt,
0
otherwise.
Obviously, we have

−∞δΔt(t)dt = 1 is satisﬁed.
(i) Localized force. We are given the parameters Δt > 0 and F0 ∈R. For
ﬁxed time t0, we choose the special force
F(t) := F0 · δΔt(t −t0)
for all
t ∈R.
By (1.3), the corresponding motion reads as
xΔt(t) = a + vt + F0 · 1

Letting Δt →+0, we get the motion7
x(t) = a + vt + F0 · G(t, t0)
for all

(1.4)
This can be considered as the motion of the particle under the inﬂuence
of the kick force t →F0δΔt(t −t0) at time t0, as Δt →+0. For t0 ≥0,
the motion (1.4) looks like

That is, the velocity jumps at time t0. For t0 < 0, (1.4) looks like
x(t) =
	
a + vt
if
t > t0,
a + vt + F0 · (t0 −t)
if
t ≤t0.
(1.6)
(ii) Superposition of the original force by kick forces (physical interpretation
of the Green’s function). Fix Δt > 0. Consider the discrete points in time
nΔt where n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . In terms of physics, let us approximate the
given force F = F(t) by a step function Fapprox. That is, we use the
superposition
Fapprox(t) :=
∞

n=−∞
Fn(t),
t ∈R
of the kick forces Fn(t) := F(nΔt)δΔt(t −nΔt)Δt. Explicitly,
Fn(t) =
	
F(nΔt)
if
nΔt ≤t ≤(n + 1)Δt,
0
otherwise.
If Δt is suﬃciently small, then the kick force Fn generates the approxi-
mate motion
xn(t) = F(nΔt)G(t, nΔt)Δt,
t ∈R
with xn(0) = 0 and ˙xn(0) = 0 for all n = ±1, ±2, . . . That is, the particle
rests at the initial time t = 0. Consequently, by superposition, the force
Fapprox generates the approximate motion
xapprox(t) =

n=−∞
xn(t) =

As Δt →0, we get the motion x(t) =

−∞G(t, τ)F(τ)dτ for all t ∈R.
The motions (1.5) and (1.6) have the following properties:
(a) t →x(t) is continuous on R.
(b) t →x(t) is smooth on R \ {t0}, and ¨x(t) = 0 for all t ̸= t0.
(c) ˙x(t0 + 0) = ˙x(t0 −0) + F0 (jump of the velocity at time t0).
(d) In the sense of distributions, we have the following equation of motion:8
m¨x(t) = F0δ(t −t0),
t ∈R.
8 We choose m := 1.

Let us prove (d). We have to show that
 ∞

x(t) ¨ϕ(t)dt = F0ϕ(t0)
for all

Noting (b), integration by parts yields that

Similarly,

 t0
−∞x(t) ¨ϕ(t)dt = x(t0) ˙ϕ(t0) −˙x(t0 −0)ϕ(t0). Finally, use (c).
2
Examples. Fix t0 := 0 and F0 := 1. If we choose a = v := 0, then the
motion (1.5) looks like
x(t) = θ(t)t
for all
t ∈R.
Here, θ denotes the Heaviside function.9 If we choose a := 0 and v := −1,
then the motion (1.5) looks like
x(t) = −θ(−t)t
for all
t ∈R.
Finally, if we choose a := 0, v := −1
2, then the motion (1.5) looks like
x(t) = 1
2(θ(t)t −θ(−t)t) = 1
2|t|
for all
t ∈R.
The relation between the theory of distributions and the method of averaging
will be discussed in Sect. 1.7.
Iterative solution of nonlinear problems. The experience of physi-
cists shows that
Interactions in nature lead to nonlinear terms in the corresponding
diﬀerential equations.
This explains the importance of nonlinear problems in physics. We want
to show that the Green’s function can also be used in order to investigate
nonlinear problems. As a prototype, consider the diﬀerential equation
m¨x(t) = −κx(t)3,
t ∈R
(1.7)
with the positive parameter κ called coupling constant, and the initial con-
dition x(0) = a, ˙x(0) = v. This problem describes an anharmonic oscillator
(see page 370). By (1.3), the initial-value problem (1.7) is equivalent to the
nonlinear integral equation
x(t) = a + vt −κ
 ∞
−∞
G(t, τ)x(τ)3dτ
for all
t ∈R,

by setting F(t) := −κx(t)3. The corresponding iterative method reads as
xn+1(t) = a + vt −κ
 ∞
−∞
G(t, τ)xn(τ)3dτ,
n = −1, 0, 1, . . .
with x−1(t) := 0 for all t ∈R. This iterative method is also called the
bootstrap method by physicists. In particular, x0(t) = a + vt for all t ∈R.
The ﬁrst approximation,
x1(t) = a + vt −κ
 ∞
−∞
G(t, τ)x0(τ)3dτ
for all
t ∈R
is called the Born approximation by physicists. If the coupling constant κ is
suﬃciently small, then the iterative method converges to the solution of the
original integral equation (1.8), that is, limn→∞xn(t) = x(t) for all t ∈R.
The two problems (1.7) and (1.8) reﬂect a crucial duality between dif-
ferential equations and integral equations. The kernel G of the inte-
gral equation (1.8) is the Green’s function of the linearized diﬀerential
equation (1.2).
In this series of monographs, we will frequently use this duality. For example,
in Sect. 8.6 we will study stationary scattering processes in quantum mechan-
ics by replacing the Schr¨odinger diﬀerential equation by the dual Lippmann–
Schwinger integral equation.
Therefore, nonlinear problems can be iteratively solved if the Green’s
function is known.
This is the method of perturbation theory, which is basic for quantum ﬁeld
theory. For the computation of the Green’s function, one can use Fourier’s
method. For the Newtonian motion (1.2), this will be studied in Sect. 2.2.14
in terms of the Fourier integral transform.
1.6 Harmonic Analysis and the Fourier Method
The superposition principle. In 1822 Fourier published his monograph
Th´eorie analytique de la chaleur (analytic heat theory) where he used both
the Fourier series and the Fourier integral in order to solve numerous problems
in heat conduction. Let us sketch the basic ideas. For given time period T > 0,
let us introduce the corresponding angular frequency
Δω := 2π
T .
Fourier’s method of harmonic analysis is the most important method for get-
ting explicit solutions of linear partial diﬀerential equations in mathematical
physics and for explicitly computing the corresponding Green’s functions.10

at inﬁnity, that is, F ∈S(R),12 then the function F can be represented
by (1.10) where the function ˆF is given by (1.11). Moreover, we have
ˆF ∈S(R). Equation (1.10) tells us that each function F ∈S(R) is the
superposition of harmonic waves t →ˆF(ω)e−itω of angular frequency ω,
and the corresponding amplitude function ω →ˆF(ω) lies in S(R). The
map F →ˆF is called the continuous Fourier transformation (or, brieﬂy,
the Fourier transformation) from the time space to the frequency space.

Prototype of the Fourier method. Consider the diﬀerential equation

(1.16)
We are given the parameter ω0 > 0 and the periodic smooth force function
F : R →R with the period T > 0. We are looking for a solution x : R →R. In
terms of physics, the function x = x(t) describes the motion of a particle with
mass m = 1 under the action of the external force F(t) and the reactive force
−ω2
0x(t) at time t. Physicists call this an harmonic oscillator. The angular
frequency of the force F is given by Δω := 2π/T.
We postulate that ω0 ̸= kΔω for all integers k.
In terms of physics, this crucial condition means that the external force F
is not in resonance with the eigenoscillations of the harmonic oscillator. The
general solution of (1.16) reads as
x(t) = ℜ(aeitω0 + be−itω0 + xspecial(t)),
t ∈R

with arbitrary complex numbers a, b. Furthermore, we have the special solu-

fore, the choice of the transformation F →ˆFasym has the disadvantage that it

The same is true for b(k). By the majorant criterion, all the Fourier series

by-term diﬀerentiation (resp. integration) is allowed. This shows that the
function xspecial given by (1.19) is indeed a special solution of the inhomoge-
neous diﬀerential equation (1.16). Finally, note that the general solution of the
homogeneous equation (1.16) with F = 0 is given by x(t) = aeitω0 + be−itω0
with arbitrary complex numbers a and b. This ﬁnishes the proof.

Resonances and the singularities of the Green’s function. Suppose
that ω0 = k0Δω for some nonzero integer k0. Then it follows from (1.18) that
the Green’s function G has a singularity if we choose k = k0. In the case where
the function F satisﬁes the condition a(k0) ̸= 0, that is,
 T/2
−T/2
F(τ)e−iτω0dτ ̸= 0,
physicists say that the external force F is in resonance with the eigenfre-
quency ω0 of the harmonic oscillator.
Resonance eﬀects cause singularities of the Green’s function.
In the present case, the diﬃculty disappears if we demand that a(k0) = 0.
Then the singularity drops out in (1.19).
Resonances are responsible for complicated physical eﬀects.
For example, the observed chaotic motion of some asteroids is due to reso-
nance eﬀects in celestial mechanics (the Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theory).
In quantum ﬁeld theory, internal resonances of the quantum ﬁeld cause spe-
cial quantum eﬀects (e.g., the Lamb shift in the spectrum of the hydrogen
atom and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron), which have to
be treated with the methods of renormalization theory (see Chap. 17 on
radiative corrections in quantum electrodynamics).

1.7 The Method of Averaging and the Theory of
Distributions
In the early 20th century, mathematicians and physicists noticed that for
wave problems, the Green’s functions possess strong singularities such that
the solution formulas of the type (1.3) fail to exist as classical integrals.14 In
his classic monograph
The Principles of Quantum Mechanics,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1930, Dirac introduced a singular object δ(t) (the
Dirac delta function), which is very useful for the description of quantum
processes and the computation of Green’s functions. In the 1940s, Laurent
Schwartz gave all these approaches a sound basis by introducing the notion
of distribution (generalized function). In order to explain Laurent Schwartz’s
basic idea of averaging, consider the continuous motion
x(t) := |t|
for all
t ∈R
of a particle on the real line. We want to compute the force F(t) = m¨x(t)
acting on the particle at time t. Classically, F(t) = 0 if t ̸= 0, and the force
does not exist at the point in time t = 0. We want to motivate that
F(t) = 2mδ(t)
for all
t ∈R.
(1.20)
(I) The language of Dirac. For the velocity, ˙x(t) = 1 if t > 0, and ˙x(t) = −1
if t < 0. For t = 0, the derivative ˙x(0) does not exist. We deﬁne ˙x(0) := 0.
Hence
˙x(t) = θ(t) −θ(−t).
Since ˙θ(t) = δ(t), we get
¨x(t) = δ(t) + δ(−t) = 2δ(t)
for all
t ∈R.
Formally, δ(t) = 0 if t ̸= 0, and δ(0) = ∞with

 ∞
−∞δ(t)dt = 1. Obviously,
there is no classical function δ which has such properties.15
(II) The language of Laurent Schwartz. Choose ε > 0. We ﬁrst pass to the
regularized motion x = xε(t) for all t ∈R. That is, the function xε : R →R
is smooth for all ε > 0 and
14 For example, see J. Hadamard, The Initial-Value Problem for Linear Hyperbolic

xε is smooth, integration by parts twice yields
Fε(ϕ) =

(1.21)
In the language of distributions, we have F = 2mδ, where δ denotes the
Dirac delta distribution. A detailed study of the theory of distributions and
its applications to physics can be found in Chaps. 11 and 12 of Vol. I. In
particular, equation (1.20) is equivalent to (1.21), in the sense of distribution
theory.
In terms of experimental physics, distributions correspond to the fact
that measurement devices only measure averaged values. It turns out that
classical functions can also be regarded as distributions. However, in contrast
to classical functions, the following is true:
Distributions possess derivatives of all orders.
Therefore, the theory of distributions is the quite natural completion of the
inﬁnitesimal strategy due to Newton and Leibniz, who lived almost three
hundred years before Laurent Schwartz. This shows convincingly that the
development of mathematics needs time.
16 For example, choose xε(t) := rε(t)|t| for all t ∈R, where the regularizing function
rε : R →[0, 1] is smooth, and rε(t) := 1 if t /∈[−2ε, 2ε], as well as rε(t) := 0 if
t ∈[−ε, ε].

The function

for all
ω ∈R
is called the symbol of the diﬀerential operator
d
dt. For n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , we
have
dn
dtn F ⇒sn ˆF.
This means that the action of the diﬀerential operator
dn
dtn , with respect to
time t, can be described by the multiplication of the Fourier transform ˆF by
sn in the frequency space.
This corresponds to a convenient algebraization of derivatives.
Over the centuries, mathematicians and physicists tried to simplify compu-
tations. The relation
ln(ab) = ln a + ln b
for all
a, b > 0
(1.25)
allows us to reduce multiplication to addition. This fact was extensively used
by Kepler (1571–1630) in order to simplify his enormous computations in
celestial mechanics.
Similarly, the Fourier transformation allows us to reduce diﬀerenti-
ation to multiplication.
Furthermore, there exists a natural generalization of the logarithmic function
to Lie groups. Then the crucial formula (1.25) passes over to the transforma-
tion formula from the Lie group G to its Lie algebra LG. This transformation
is well deﬁned for the group elements near the unit element (see Vol. III).
Pseudo-diﬀerential operators and Fourier integral operators. The

operators) and Fourier integral operators is based on the use of symbols of
the form

which depend on frequency ω, time t, and time τ. The expressions

R2 s(ω, t, τ)F(τ)eiϕ(ω,t,τ) dτdω,

correspond to the pseudo-diﬀerential operator A and the Fourier integral
operator B. If we choose the special phase function
ϕ(ω, t, τ) := ω(t −τ),
then the operator B passes over to A. If, in addition, the symbol s does not
depend on τ, then integration over τ yields
(AF)(t) =

 ∞
−∞
s(ω, t) ˆF(ω)e−iωt dω.
In the special case where the symbol s(ω, t) only depends on the frequency
ω, the pseudo-diﬀerential operator corresponds to the multiplication operator
ω →s(ω) ˆF(ω) in the frequency space (also called Fourier space).
Long before the foundation of the theory of pseudo-diﬀerential operators
and Fourier integral operators in the 1960s and 1970s, mathematicians and
physicists used integral expressions of the form (1.26) and (1.27) in order to
compute explicit solutions in electrodynamics (e.g., the Heaviside calculus
and the Laplace transform applied to the study of electric circuits17), elastic-
ity (singular integral equations), geometric optics (e.g., diﬀraction of light),
and quantum mechanics.
The point is that the symbols know a lot about the properties of the
corresponding operators, and an elegant algebraic calculus for opera-
tors can be based on algebraic operations for the symbols.

Heaviside’s formal approach. Consider the diﬀerential equation
d
dtx(t) −x(t) = f(t).
(1.28)
We want to discuss the beauty, but also the shortcomings of the symbolic
method due to Heaviside (1850–1925). Formally, we get
 d


x(t) = f(t).
Hence
x(t) =

For complex numbers z with |z| < 1, we have the convergent geometric series

f(t).
(1.29)
If we choose f(t) := t2, then
x(t) = −t2 −2t −2.
(1.30)
Surprisingly enough, we get ˙x(t) = −2t−2 = x(t)+t2. Therefore, the function
x(t) from (1.30) is a solution of (1.28). The same is true for all polynomials.
To prove this, let f be a polynomial of degree n = 0, 1, 2 . . . Set

1.8 The Symbolic Method
31
x(t) = et + et + et + . . . ,
which is meaningless. There arises the problem of establishing a more pow-
erful method. In the history of mathematics and physics, formal (also called
symbolic) methods were rigorously justiﬁed by using the following tools:
• the Fourier transformation,
• the Laplace transformation (which can be reduced to the Fourier transfor-
mation),
• Mikusi´nski’s operational calculus based on the quotient ﬁeld over a convo-
lution algebra,
• von Neumann’s operator calculus in Hilbert space,
• the theory of distributions,
• pseudo-diﬀerential operators and distributions (e.g., the Weyl calculus in
quantum mechanics), and
• Fourier integral operators and distributions.
Mikusi´nski’s elegant approach will be considered in Sect. 4.2 on page 191.
Motivation of the Laplace transformation via Fourier transfor-
mation. Consider the motion x = x(t) of a particle on the real line with
x(t) = 0 for all t ≤0. Suppose that the function x : R →R is continuous
and bounded. The Fourier transform from the time space to the energy space
reads as
ˆx(E) =
1
√
2πℏ
 ∞
−∞
x(t)eiEt/ℏdt =
1
√
2πℏ
 ∞
0
x(t)eiEt/ℏdt.
As a rule, this integral does not exist. To improve the situation, we ﬁx the
regularization parameter ε > 0, and we deﬁne the damped motion
xε(t) := x(t)e−εt
for all
t ∈R.
This is also called the adiabatic regularization of the original motion. Obvi-
ously, limε→+0 xε(t) = x(t) for all t ∈R. The Fourier transform looks like
ˆxε(E) =
1
√
2πℏ
 ∞
0
x(t)e−εteiEt/ℏdt =

x(t)eiEt/ℏdt,
by introducing the complex energy E := E + iε. To simplify notation, we set
ℏ:= 1.
Complex energies, damped oscillations, and the Laplace trans-
form. The formal Heaviside calculus was justiﬁed by Doetsch in the 1930s by
using the Laplace transform.18 As a simple example, let us use the Laplace
transformation in order to solve the diﬀerential equation (1.28). In particular,
we will consider the case

on the real line L := {E + (γ1 + 1)i : E ∈R} of the complex energy space.
Here, we choose a system of units with ℏ= h/2π := 1 for Planck’s action
quantum.19 The Laplace transform sends the function t →x(t) on the time
space to the function E →(Lx)(E) on the complex energy space. Here, it is
crucial to use complex energies E = E −Γi. In what follows, we will use the
standard properties of the Laplace transformation which are proved in Sect.
2.2.6 of Vol. I. Let us start with an example. Choose the complex energy
E0 := E0 −Γ0i with real values E0 and Γ0, and set20
x(t) := e−iE0t = e−iE0t · e−Γ0t,
t ∈R.
(1.33)
Then, γ1 = −Γ0 = ℑ(E0), and we get
(Lx)(E) =
i
E −E0
,
ℑ(E) > ℑ(E0).
Now to the point. We are given the smooth function f : [0, ∞[→C with the
growth condition
|f(t)| ≤const · eγ0t
for all
t ≥0.
In order to solve the diﬀerential equation (1.28), we proceed as follows.
(I) Suppose ﬁrst that the diﬀerential equation (1.28) has a smooth solution
x : [0, ∞[→C with |x(t)| ≤const · eγ1t for all t ≥0 with γ1 ≥γ0. Then
19 Set γ2 := γ1 + 1. The principal value of the integral is deﬁned by

20 If E0 > 0 and Γ0 > 0 then (1.33) is a damped oscillation with angular frequency
ω0 := E0/ℏ= E0 and mean lifetime Δt = Γ0/ℏ= Γ0.

1.8 The Symbolic Method
33
the Laplace transforms Lx and Lf exist for all E ∈C with ℑ(E) > γ1.
Furthermore,
(L ˙x)(E) = −iE(L)(E) −x(+0),
that is, the Laplace transforms converts diﬀerentiation into multiplication
and translation in the complex energy space. By (1.28),
−iE(Lx)(E) −(Lx)(E) −x(+0) = (Lf)(E),
ℑ(E) > γ1.
This yields the Laplace transform of the solution t →x(t), namely,
(Lx)(E) = ix(+0)
E −i + i(Lf)(E)
E −i
.
Setting g(t) := et, we get (Lg)(E) =
i
E−i. Therefore,
Lx = (Lg)x(+0) + (Lg)(Lf).
The convolution rule from Sect. 2.2.6 of Vol. I tells us that
x = gx(+0) + g ∗f.
Explicitly, this reads as
x(t) = etx(+0) +
 t
0
e(t−τ)f(τ)dτ.
(1.34)
Our argument shows that a solution of (1.28) has necessarily the form (1.34).
(II) Conversely, diﬀerentiation yields
˙x(t) = etx(+0) + f(t) +
 t
0
e(t−τ)f(τ)dτ = x(t) + f(t)
for all t ≥0. Consequently, the function x = x(t) given by (1.34) is indeed
a solution of the original diﬀerential equation (1.28) for all times t ≥0. For
example, if f(t) := et, then
x(t) = etx(+0) + tet.
This is a solution of (1.28) for all times t ∈R.
The same method of the Laplace transformation can be applied to general
systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations with constant coeﬃcients. Such
equations are basic for the investigation of electrical circuits. Therefore, the
Laplace transformation plays a key role in electrical engineering.

1.9 Gauge Theory – Local Symmetry and the
Description of Interactions by Gauge Fields
As we have discussed in Chap. 2 of Vol. I, the Standard Model in particle
physics is based on
• 12 basic particles (6 quarks and 6 leptons), and
• 12 interacting particles (the photon, the 3 vector bosons W +, W −, Z0 and
8 gluons).
This model was formulated in the 1960s and early 1970s. Note the following
crucial fact about the structure of the fundamental interactions in nature.
The ﬁelds of the interacting particles can be obtained from the ﬁelds
of the basic particles by using the principle of local symmetry (also
called the gauge principle).
Prototype of a gauge theory. Let us explain the basic ideas by consid-
ering the following simple model. To this end, let us choose the unit square
Q := {(x, t) : 0 ≤x, t ≤1}. We start with the principle of critical action

Q
L(ψ, ψt, ψx; ψ†, ψ†
t, ψ†
x) dxdt = critical!
(1.35)
with the boundary condition ψ = ψ0 on ∂Q and the special Lagrangian
L := ψ†ψt + ψ†ψx.
(1.36)
Here, ψt (resp. ψx) denotes the partial derivative of ψ with respect to time
t (resp. position x). We are given a ﬁxed continuous function ψ0 : ∂Q →C
on the boundary of the square Q. We are looking for a smooth function
ψ : Q →C which solves the variational problem (1.35).
By a basic result from the calculus of variations, we get the following.
If the function ψ is a solution of (1.35), then it is a solution of the two
Euler–Lagrange equations
∂
∂tLψ†
t + ∂
∂xLψ†
x = Lψ†
(1.37)
and
∂
∂tLψt + ∂
∂xLψx = Lψ.
(1.38)
Here, the symbol Lψ (resp. Lψ†) denotes the partial derivative of L with
respect to the variable ψ (resp. ψ†). The proof can be found in Problem 14.7
of Vol. I. Explicitly, the two Euler–Lagrange equations read as
ψt + ψx = 0,
ψ†
t + ψ†
x = 0.
(1.39)

1.9 Gauge Theory and Local Symmetry
35
If the function ψ is a solution of (1.39), then we have
(ψψ†)t + (ψψ†)x = 0,
(1.40)
which is called a conservation law. In fact, ψtψ† + ψ†
tψ = −ψxψ† −ψ†
xψ.
This is equal to −(ψψ†)x. Conservation laws play a fundamental role in all
ﬁelds of physics, since they simplify the computation of solutions. In the 18th
and 19th century, astronomers unsuccessfully tried to ﬁnd 6N conservation
laws for the motion of N bodies in celestial mechanics (N ≥3), in order to
compute the solution and to prove the stability of our solar system.21
Step by step, mathematicians and physicists discovered that
Conservation laws are intimately related to symmetries.
The precise formulation of this principle is the content of the Noether theorem
proved in 1918 (see Sect. 6.6). We want to show that the invariance of the
Lagrangian L (with respect to a global gauge transformation) is behind the
conservation law (1.40).
(i) Global symmetry and the Noether theorem. Let α be a ﬁxed real number.
We consider the global symmetry transformation
ψ+(x, t) := eiαψ(x, t)
for all
x, t ∈R,
(1.41)
that is, the ﬁeld ψ is multiplied by the constant phase factor eiα, where
α is called the phase. The transformation (1.41) is also called a global
gauge transformation, by physicists. We also deﬁne the inﬁnitesimal
gauge transformation δψ by setting
δψ(x, t) := d
dα

eiαψ(x, t)

|α=0 = iψ(x, t).
This means that ψ+(x, t) = 1+α·δψ(x, t)+O(α2) as α →0. Noting that
ψ†
+ = e−iαψ†, the special Lagrangian L from (1.36) is invariant under the
global gauge transformation (1.41), that is,
ψ†
+(ψ+)t + ψ†
+(ψ+)x = ψ†ψt + ψ†ψx.
Generally, the Lagrangian L is invariant under the global gauge trans-
formation (1.41) iﬀ
L(ψ+, (ψ+)t, (ψ+)x; ψ†
+, (ψ†
+)t, (ψ†
+)x) = L(ψ, ψt, ψx; ψ†, ψ†
t, ψ†
x).

1. Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy
Then a special case of the famous Noether theorem on page 387 tells us
the following: If the function ψ is a solution of the variational problem
(1.35), then
∂
∂t

Lψtδψ + Lψ†
t δψ†
+ ∂
∂x

Lψxδψ + Lψ†
xδψ†
= 0.
If we choose the special Lagrangian L = ψ†ψt + ψ†ψx, then we obtain
the conservation law (1.40).
(ii) Local symmetry and the covariant derivative. We now replace the global
gauge transformation (1.40) by the following local gauge transformation
ψ+(x, t) := eiα(x,t)ψ(x, t)
for all
x, t ∈R,
(1.42)
where the phase α depends on space and time. We postulate the following
crucial local symmetry principle:
(P) The Lagrangian L is invariant under local gauge transforma-
tions.
It can be easily shown that the function L from (1.36) does not possess
this invariance property for arbitrary functions α = α(x, t). This follows
from
(ψ+)t = iαteiαψ + eiαψt.
Here, the appearance of the derivative αt of the phase function α destroys
the invariance property of L.
Our goal is to modify the function L in such a way that it is invariant
under (1.42). To this end, we introduce the so-called covariant partial
derivatives
∇t := ∂
∂t + iU(x, t),
∇x := ∂
∂x + iA(x, t),
(1.43)
where U, A : R2 →R are given smooth real-valued functions called gauge
ﬁelds. The local gauge transformation of U and A is deﬁned by
U+ := U −αt,
A+ := A −αx.
Furthermore, we deﬁne the following transformation law for the covariant
partial derivatives:
∇+
t := ∂
∂t + iU+,
∇+
x := ∂
∂x + iA+.
(1.44)
The key relation is given by the following elegant transformation law for
the covariant partial derivatives:
∇+
t ψ+ = eiα∇tψ,
∇+
x ψ+ = eiα∇xψ.
(1.45)

1.9 Gauge Theory and Local Symmetry
37
Theorem 1.1 There holds (1.45).
This theorem tells us the crucial fact that, in contrast to the classical
partial derivatives, the covariant partial derivatives are transformed in
the same way as the ﬁeld ψ itself. This property is typical for covariant
partial derivatives in mathematics. Indeed, our construction of covariant
partial derivatives has been chosen in such a way that (1.45) is valid.
Proof. By the product rule,
 ∂
∂t + iU+

ψ+ = eiα(iαtψ + ψt + iU+ψ) = eiα
 ∂
∂t + iU

ψ.
This yields ∇+
t ψ+ = eiα∇tψ. Similarly, we get ∇+
x ψ+ = eiα∇xψ.
2
Now let us discuss the main idea of gauge theory:
We replace the classical partial derivatives ∂
∂t, ∂
∂x by the covariant
partial derivatives ∇t, ∇x, respectively.
This is the main trick of gauge theory. In particular, we replace the
Lagrangian
L = ψ† ∂
∂tψ + ψ† ∂
∂xψ
from the original variational problem (1.35) by the modiﬁed Lagrangian
L := ψ†∇tψ + ψ†∇xψ.
Explicitly, we have
L = ψ†ψt + ψ†ψx + iψ†Uψ + iψ†Aψ.
The corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations (1.37) and (1.38) read as
∇tψ + ∇xψ = 0,
(1.46)
and (∇tψ + ∇xψ)† = 0, respectively.
The local symmetry principle (P) above is closely related to the Faraday–
Green locality principle, saying that physical interactions are localized in
space and time.
Summarizing, the local symmetry principle (P) enforces the existence
of additional gauge ﬁelds U, A which interact with the originally given
ﬁeld ψ.
In the Standard Model in particle physics and in the theory of general rela-
tivity, the additional gauge ﬁelds are responsible for the interacting particles.
Consequently, the mathematical structure of the fundamental inter-
actions in nature is a consequence of the local symmetry principle.

38
1. Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy
In his search of a uniﬁed theory for all interactions in nature, Einstein was
not successful, since he was not aware of the importance of the principle of
local symmetry. In our discussion below, the following notions will be crucial:
• local gauge transformation,
• gauge force F,
• connection form A,
• curvature form F (gauge force form), and
• parallel transport of information.
Gauge force. Covariant partial derivatives can be used in order to in-
troduce the following notions:
(a) Gauge force (also called curvature): We deﬁne
iF := ∇x∇t −∇t∇x.
(1.47)
In physics, the function F is called the force induced by the gauge ﬁelds
U, A. Explicitly, we get
F = Ux −At.
(1.48)
Relation (1.47) tells us that:
The “gauge force” F measures the non-commutativity of the co-
variant partial derivatives.
In particular, the force F vanishes if the gauge ﬁelds U, A vanish. The
proof of (1.48) follows from
∇t(∇xψ) =
 ∂
∂t + iU

(ψx + iAψ)
= ψtx + iAtψ + iAψt + iUψx −UAψ
and
∇x(∇tψ) =
 ∂
∂x + iA

(ψt + iUψ)
= ψxt + iUxψ + iUψx + iAψt −AUψ.
Hence (∇x∇t −∇t∇x)ψ = i(Ux −At)ψ.
2
The transformation of the force F with respect to the gauge transforma-
tion ψ+(x, t) = eiα(x,y)ψ(x, t) is deﬁned by
iF + := ∇+
x ∇+
t −∇+

Proof. It follows from Theorem 1.1 on page 37 that
iF +ψ+ = (∇+
x ∇+
t −∇+
t ∇+
x )ψ+ = ∇+
x (eiα∇tψ) −∇+
t (eiα∇xψ)
= eiα(∇x∇tψ −∇t∇xψ) = eiαiFψ = (eiαiFe−iα)ψ+.
2
In the present case, we have the commutativity property Fe−iα = e−iαF.
Hence
F + = eiαe−iαF = F,
that is, the force F is gauge invariant. In more general gauge theories,
the phase factor eiα(x,t) is a matrix. In this case, the force F is not gauge
invariant anymore. However, it is possible to construct gauge invariants
which depend on F. This is the case for the Standard Model in particle
physics (see Vol. III).
(b) Covariant directional derivative: Consider the curve
C : x = x(σ), t = t(σ),
where the curve parameter σ varies in the interval [0, σ0]. The classical
directional derivative along the curve C is deﬁned by
d
dσ := dx(σ)
dσ
∂
∂x + dt(σ)
dσ
∂
∂t.
Explicitly, we get
d
dσ ψ(x(σ), t(σ)) = dx(σ)
dσ
ψx(x(σ), t(σ)) + dt(σ)
dσ ψt(x(σ), t(σ)).
Similarly, the covariant directional derivative along the curve C is deﬁned
by
D
dσ := dx(σ)
dσ
∇x + dt(σ)
dσ ∇t.
Explicitly,
D
dσ ψ(x(σ), t(σ)) = d
dσ ψ(x(σ), t(σ)) + iA(x(σ)), t(σ))dx(σ)
dσ
+iU(x(σ), t(σ))dt(σ)
dσ .

(c) Parallel transport: We say that the ﬁeld function ψ is parallel along the
curve C iﬀ
D
dσ ψ(x(σ), t(σ)) = 0,
0 ≤σ ≤σ0.
(1.50)
By (1.49), this notion depends on the gauge ﬁelds U, A. In particular, if
the gauge ﬁelds U, A vanish, then parallel transport means that the ﬁeld
ψ is constant along the curve C.

1. Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy
The following observation is crucial. It follows from the key relation (1.45)
on page 36 that the equation (1.50) of parallel transport is invariant under
local gauge transformations. This means that (1.50) implies
D+
dσ ψ+(x(σ), t(σ)) = 0,
0 ≤σ ≤σ0.
Consequently, in terms of mathematics, parallel transport possesses a geo-
metric meaning with respect to local symmetry transformations.
In terms of physics, parallel transport describes the transport of phys-
ical information in space and time.
This transport is local in space and time, which reﬂects the Faraday–Green
locality principle.
The Cartan diﬀerential. The most elegant formulation of gauge theo-
ries is based on the use of the covariant Cartan diﬀerential. As a preparation,
let us recall the classical Cartan calculus. We will use the following relations:
dx ∧dt = −dt ∧dx,
dx ∧dx = 0,
dt ∧dt = 0.
(1.51)
Moreover, the wedge product of three factors of the form dx, dt is always
equal to zero. For example,
dx ∧dt ∧dt = 0,
dt ∧dx ∧dt = 0.
(1.52)
For the wedge product, both the distributive law and the associative law are
valid. Let ψ : R2 →C be a smooth function. By deﬁnition,
• dψ := ψxdx + ψtdt.
The diﬀerential 1-form
A := iAdx + iUdt
(1.53)
is called the Cartan connection form. By deﬁnition,
• dA := idA ∧dx + idU ∧dt,
• d(ψ dx ∧dt) = dψ ∧dx ∧dt = 0 (Poincar´e identity).
The Poincar´e identity is a consequence of (1.52).
The covariant Cartan diﬀerential. We now replace the classical par-
tial derivatives by the corresponding covariant partial derivatives. Therefore,
we replace dψ by the deﬁnition
• Dψ := ∇xψ dx + ∇tψ dt.
Similarly, we deﬁne
• DA := iDA ∧dx + iDU ∧dt,
• D(ψ dx ∧dt) = Dψ ∧dx ∧dt = 0 (Bianchi identity).

1.9 Gauge Theory and Local Symmetry
41
The Bianchi identity is a consequence of (1.52). Let us introduce the Cartan
curvature form F by setting
F := DA.
(1.54)
Theorem 1.3 (i) Dψ = dψ + Aψ.
(ii) F = dA + A ∧A (Cartan’s structural equation).
(iii) DF = 0 (Bianchi identity).
In addition, we have the following relations for the curvature form F:
• F = dA + [U, A]−.22
• F = iFdx ∧dt, where iF = Ux −At.
Proof. Ad (i). Dψ = (ψx + iAψ)dx + (ψt + iUψ)dt.
Ad (ii). Note that
DA = i(Ax + A2)dx + i(At + iUA)dt,
DU = i(Ux + iAU)dx + (Ut + iU 2)dt,
and
A ∧A = −(Adx + Udt) ∧(Adx + Udt) = (UA −AU) dx ∧dt.
Hence
DA = iDA ∧dx + iDU ∧dt
= i(At + iUA) dt ∧dx + i(Ux + iAU) dx ∧dt = dA + A ∧A.
This yields all the identities claimed above.
2
The results concerning the curvature form F above show that Cartan’s
structural equation (1.54) is nothing else than a reformulation of the equation
iF = Ux −At,
which relates the force F to the potentials U, A. Furthermore, we will show
in Sect. 5.11 on page 333 that Cartan’s structural equation is closely related
to both
• Gauss’ theorema egregium on the computation of the Gaussian curvature of
a classic surfaces by means of the metric tensor and its partial derivatives,
• and the Riemann formula for the computation of the Riemann curvature
tensor of a Riemannian manifold by means of the metric tensor and its
partial derivatives.
In the present case, the formulas can be simpliﬁed in the following way. It
follows from the commutativity property AU = UA that:
22 Here, we use the Lie bracket [U, A]−:= UA −AU.

42
1. Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy
• F = dA,
• F = iF dx ∧dt = i(Ux −At) dx ∧dt.
A similar situation appears in Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism. For
more general gauge theories, the symbols A and U represent matrices. Then
we obtain the additional nonzero terms [U, A]−and A ∧A. This is the case
in the Standard Model of elementary particles (see Vol. III).
The mathematical language of ﬁber bundles. In mathematics, we
proceed as follows:
• We consider the ﬁeld ψ : R2 →C as a section of the line bundle R2 × C
(with typical ﬁber C) (see Fig. 4.9 on page 208).
• The line bundle R2×C is associated to the principal ﬁber bundle R2×U(1)
(with structure group U(1) called the gauge group in physics).23
• As above, the diﬀerential 1-form A := iAdx+iUdt is called the connection
form on the base manifold R2 of the principal ﬁber bundle R2 ×U(1) , and
• the diﬀerential 2-form
F = dA + A ∧A
is called the curvature form on the base manifold R2 of the principle ﬁber
bundle R2 × U(1).
• Finally, we deﬁne
Dψ := dψ + Aψ.
(1.55)
This is called the covariant diﬀerential of the section ψ of the line bundle
R2 × C.
Observe that:
The values of the gauge ﬁeld functions iU, iA are contained in the Lie
algebra u(1) of the Lie group U(1). Thus, the connection form A is
a diﬀerential 1-form with values in the Lie algebra u(1).
This can be generalized by replacing
• the special commutative Lie group U(1)
• by the the general Lie group G.
Then the values of the gauge ﬁelds iU, iA are contained in the Lie algebra LG
to G. If G is a noncommutative Lie group (e.g., SU(N) with N ≥2), then the
additional force term A∧A does not vanish identically, as in the special case
of the commutative group U(1).24 In Vol. III on gauge theory, we will show
that the Standard Model in particle physics corresponds to this approach by
choosing the gauge group U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3). Here,
23 Recall that the elements of the Lie group U(1) are the complex numbers eiα with
real parameter α. The elements of the Lie algebra u(1) are the purely imaginary
numbers αi.
24 The Lie group SU(N) consists of all the unitary (N × N)-matrices whose deter-
minant is equal to one (special unitary group).

• the electroweak interaction is the curvature of a (U(1) × SU(2))-bundle
(Glashow, Salam and Weinberg in the 1960s), and
• the strong interaction is the curvature of a SU(3)-bundle (Gell-Mann and
Fritzsch in the early 1970s).
Historical remarks. General gauge theory is equivalent to modern dif-
ferential geometry. This will be thoroughly studied in Vol. III. At this point
let us only make a few historical remarks.
In 1827 Gauss proved that the curvature of a 2-dimensional surface
in 3-dimensional Euclidean space is an intrinsic property of the man-
ifold.
This means that the curvature of the surface can be measured without using
the surrounding space. This is the content of Gauss’ theorema egregium. The
Gauss theory was generalized to higher-dimensional manifolds by Riemann
in 1854. Here, the Gaussian curvature has to be replaced by the Riemann
curvature tensor. In 1915 Einstein used this mathematical approach in or-
der to formulate his theory of gravitation (general theory of relativity). In
Einstein’s setting, the masses of celestial bodies (stars, planets, and so on)
determine the Riemann curvature tensor of the four-dimensional space-time
manifold which corresponds to the universe. Thus, Newton’s gravitational
force is replaced by the curvature of a four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian
manifold M4. The motion of a celestial body (e.g., the motion of a planet
around the sun) is described by a geodesic curve C in M4. Therefore, Ein-
stein’s equation of motion tells us that the 4-dimensional velocity vector of
C is parallel along the curve C. Roughly speaking, this corresponds to (1.50)
where ψ has to be replaced by the velocity ﬁeld of C. In the framework of
his theory of general relativity, Einstein established the principle
force = curvature
for gravitation. Nowadays, the Standard Model in particle physics is also
based on this beautiful principle which is the most profound connection be-
tween mathematics and physics.
In 1917 Levi-Civita introduced the notion of parallel transport, and he
showed that both the Gaussian curvature of 2-dimensional surfaces and the
Riemann curvature tensor of higher-dimensional manifolds can be computed
by using parallel transport of vector ﬁelds along small closed curves. In the
1920s, ´Elie Cartan invented the method of moving frames.25 In the 1950s,
Ehresmann generalized Cartan’s method of moving frames to the modern
curvature theory for principal ﬁber bundles (i.e., the ﬁbers are Lie groups)
and their associated vector bundles (i.e., the ﬁbers are linear spaces). In 1963,
Kobayashi and Nomizu published the classic monograph
25 For an introduction to this basic tool in modern diﬀerential geometry, we refer

In 1954, the physicists Yang and Mills created the Yang–Mills theory. It
was their goal to generalize Maxwell’s electrodynamics. To this end, they
started with the observation that Maxwell’s electrodynamics can be formu-
lated as a gauge theory with the gauge group U(1). This was known from
Hermann Weyl’s paper: Elektron und Gravitation, Z. Phys. 56 (1929), 330–
352 (in German). Yang and Mills
• replaced the commutative group U(1)
• by the non-commutative group SU(2).
The group SU(2) consists of all the complex (2×2)-matrices A with AA† = I
and det A = 1. Interestingly enough, in 1954 Yang and Mills did not know
a striking physical application of their model. However, in the 1960s and
1970s, the Standard Model in particle physics was established as a modiﬁed
Yang–Mills theory with the gauge group
U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3).
The modiﬁcation concerns the use of an additional ﬁeld called Higgs ﬁeld
in order to generate the masses of the three gauge bosons W +, W −, Z0. In
the early 1970s, Yang noticed that the Yang–Mills theory is a special case of
Ehresmann’s modern diﬀerential geometry in mathematics. For the history
of gauge theory, we refer to:

Notices of the American Mathematical Society 236 (1984), 589–608:26
There is an exciting development taking place right now, reuniﬁcation of
mathematics with theoretical physics. . . In the last ten or ﬁfteen years
mathematicians and physicists realized that modern geometry is in fact
the natural framework for gauge theory. The gauge potential in gauge
theory is the connection of mathematics. The gauge ﬁeld is the mathe-
matical curvature deﬁned by the connection; certain charges in physics are
the topological invariants studied by mathematicians. While the mathe-
maticians and physicists worked separately on similar ideas, they did not

duplicate each other’s eﬀorts. The mathematicians produced general, far-
reaching theories and investigated their ramiﬁcations. Physicists worked
out details of certain examples which turned out to describe nature beauti-
fully and elegantly. When the two met again, the results are more powerful
than either anticipated. . . In mathematics, we now have a new motivation
to use speciﬁc insights from the examples worked out by physicists. This
signals the return to an ancient tradition.
Felix Klein (1849–1925) writes about mathematics:
Our science, in contrast to others, is not founded on a single period of
human history, but has accompanied the development of culture through
all its stages. Mathematics is as much interwoven with Greek culture as
with the most modern problems in engineering. It not only lends a hand
to the progressive natural sciences but participates at the same time in
the abstract investigations of logicians and philosophers.

1.10 The Challenge of Dark Matter
Although science teachers often tell their students that the periodic table
of the elements shows what the Universe is made of, this is not true. We
now know that most of the universe – about 96% of it – is made of dark
matter that deﬁes brief description, and certainly is not represented by
Mendeleev’s periodic table. This unseen ‘dark matter’ is the subject of
this book. . .
Dark matter provides a further remainder that we humans are not essential
to the Universe. Ever since Copernicus (1473–1543) and others suggested
that the Earth was not the center of the Universe, humans have been on
a slide away from cosmic signiﬁcance. At ﬁrst we were not at the center of
the Solar System, and then the Sun became just another star in the Milky
Way, not even in the center of our host Galaxy. By this stage the Earth
and its inhabitants had vanished like a speck of dust in a storm. This was
a shock.
In the 1930s Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way, vast as it is, is a
mere ‘island Universe’ far removed from everywhere special; and even our
home galaxy was suddenly insigniﬁcant in a sea of galaxies, then clusters
of galaxies. Now astronomers have revealed that we are not even made of
the same stuﬀas most of the Universe. While our planet – our bodies, even
– are tangible and visible, most of the matter in the Universe is not. Our
Universe is made of darkness. How do we respond to that?

2. The Basic Strategy of Extracting Finite
Information from Inﬁnities – Ariadne’s Thread
in Renormalization Theory
There is no doubt that renormalization is one of the most sophisticated
procedures for obtaining signiﬁcant numerical quantities by starting from
meaningless mathematical expressions. This is fascinating for both physi-
cists and mathematicians.1
Alain Connes, 2003
Quantum ﬁeld theory deals with ﬁelds ψ(x) that destroy and create parti-
cles at a spacetime point x. Earlier experience with classical electron theory
provided a warning that a point electron will have inﬁnite electromagnetic
self-mass; this mass is
e2
6πac2
for a surface distribution of charge with radius a, and therefore blows
up for a →0. Disappointingly this problem appeared with even greater
severity in the early days of quantum ﬁeld theory, and although greatly
ameliorated by subsequent improvements in the theory, it remains with us
to the present day.
The problem of inﬁnities in quantum ﬁeld theory was apparently ﬁrst
noted in the 1929–30 papers by Heisenberg and Pauli.2 Soon after, the
presence of inﬁnities was conﬁrmed by calculations of the electromagnetic
self-energy of a bound electron by Oppenheimer, and of a free electron by
Ivar Waller.3

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
2.1 Renormalization Theory in a Nutshell
In renormalization theory, one has to clearly distinguish between
(I) mathematical regularization of inﬁnities, and
(II) renormalization of physical parameters by introducing eﬀective parameters
which relate the mathematical regularization to physical measurements.
In order to help the reader to ﬁnd his/her way through the jungle of renormalization
theory, let us discuss a few basic ideas. (The details will be studied later on.) This
concerns:
• Bare and eﬀective parameters – the eﬀective frequency and the running coupling
constant of an anharmonic oscillator.
• The renormalized Green’s function and the renormalization group.
• The zeta function, Riemann’s idea of analytic continuation, and the Casimir
eﬀect in quantum electrodynamics.
• Meromorphic functions and Mittag-Leﬄer’s idea of subtractions.
• Euler’s gamma function and the dimensional regularization of integrals.
Behind this there is the general strategy of extracting ﬁnite information from in-
ﬁnities. For example, we will consider the following examples:
• Regularization of divergent integrals (including the famous overlapping diver-
gences).
• Abel’s adiabatic regularization of inﬁnite series.
• Adiabatic regularization of oscillating integrals (the prototype of the Feynman
path integral trick).
• Poincar´e’s asymptotic series, the Landau singularity, and the Ritt theorem.
• The summation methods by Euler, Frobenius, H¨older, and Borel.
• Tikhonov regularization of ill-posed problems.
In modern renormalization theory, the combinatorics of Feynman diagrams plays
the crucial role. This is related to the mathematical notion of
• Hopf algebras and
• Rota–Baxter algebras.
The prototypes of these algebras appear in classical complex function theory in
connection with the inversion of holomorphic functions (the relation between La-
grange’s inversion formula and the coinverse (antipode) of a Hopf algebra) and
the regularization of Laurent series (Rota-Baxter algebras). This will be studied in
Chap. 3.
2.1.1 Eﬀective Frequency and Running Coupling Constant of an
Anharmonic Oscillator
In quantum electrodynamics, physicists distinguish between
• the bare mass of the electron, and
• its eﬀective mass (resp. the bare charge of the electron and its eﬀective charge).
The eﬀective mass and the eﬀective charge of the electron coincide with the physical
quantities measured in physical experiments. In contrast to this, the bare parame-
ters are only introduced as auxiliary quantities in renormalization theory for con-
structing the eﬀective quantities in terms of a mathematical algorithm. To illustrate
the crucial diﬀerence between bare parameters and eﬀective physical parameters, let
us summarize the main features of a simple rigorous model which is studied in Sect.

2.1 Renormalization Theory in a Nutshell
49
11. 5 of Vol. I in full detail. We consider the following nonlinear boundary-value
problem
¨x(t) + ω2x(t) = −κx(t)3 + μ sin t, t ∈R, x(0) = x(π) = 0.
(2.1)
In terms of physics, this equation describes the motion x = x(t) of a point of mass
m = 1 on the real line. The positive parameters ω and κ are called the angular
frequency and the coupling constant, respectively. Moreover, the real parameter
μ measures the strength of the external force F(t) = μ sin t. The term −κx(t)3
describes the self-interaction of the particle. The sign convention of κ is chosen in
such a way that positive values of κ correspond to a repulsive force, by (6.16) on
page 370. Physicists call this an anharmonic oscillator. We will assume that the
coupling constant κ and the external force parameter μ are suﬃciently small. Then
it is possible to apply the methods of perturbation theory. We are looking for a
smooth 2π-periodic odd solution x : R →R of (2.1). By the theory of Fourier
series, the function x(.) possesses the convergent representation
x(t) = b1 sin t + b2 sin 2t + . . .
for all
t ∈R
(2.2)
with the Fourier coeﬃcients bk :=
q
2
π
R π
0 F(t) sin kt dt where k = 1, 2, . . . In what
follows, we will also write bk(x) instead of bk. For the mathematical analysis, it is
crucial ﬁrst to study the homogeneous linearized problem
¨x(t) + ω2x(t) = 0,
t ∈R,
x(0) = x(π) = 0
(2.3)
and the inhomogeneous linearized problem
¨x(t) + ω2x(t) = F(t),
t ∈R,
x(0) = x(π) = 0
(2.4)
with the given smooth, 2π-periodic, odd force function F : R →R. Then the
function F allows the convergent representation
F(t) = β1 sin t + β2 sin 2t + . . . ,
t ∈R
with the Fourier coeﬃcients βk := bk(F) =
q
2
π
R π
0 F(t) sin kt dt, k = 1, 2, . . . If
x(t) = b1 sin t + b2 sin 2t + . . . is a solution of (2.4), then
(ω2 −12)b1 sin t + (ω2 −22)b2 sin 2t + . . . = β1 sin t + β2 sin 2t + . . .
This implies the key condition
bk(ω2 −k2) = βk,
k = 1, 2, . . .
(2.5)
In particular, this tells us that the homogeneous linearized problem (2.3) (i.e.,
βk = 0 for all k) has precisely the following nontrivial solutions
ω = k,
x(t) = C sin kt,
t ∈R,
k = 1, 2, . . .
which are called eigenoscillations in physics. Here, C is a free complex parameter.
Let us now investigate the nonlinear problem (2.1). We have to distinguish
between two cases, namely,
• the regular non-resonance case and
• the singular resonance case which corresponds to renormalization in physics.

50
2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
We will show that the trouble comes from resonances between the external
forces and the eigenoscillations.
To illustrate this, consider problem (2.4) with ω := 1. By (2.5), we get β1 = 0.
Explicitly,
Z π
0
F(t) sin t dt = 0.
(2.6)
This is a solvability condition for the external force F. The original problem (2.4)
has a solution iﬀ(2.6) is satisﬁed. In terms of physics, condition (2.6) means that the
external force is not in resonance with the eigenoscillation t →sin t. In particular,
if we choose ω := 1 and F(t) := sin t, then the condition (2.6) is violated, and
problem (2.4) has no solution.
In contrast to this, if ω := 1 and F(t) = sin kt for ﬁxed k = 2, 3, . . . , then it
follows from (2.5) that the original problem (2.4) has the general solution
x(t) = C sin t + sin kt
1 −k2
(2.7)
where C is an arbitrary complex parameter. The point is that, in this critical case,
the external force F does not uniquely determine the motion x = x(t) of the mass
point. Thus the mathematical theory does not determine the parameter C.
For a given motion x = x(t), the speciﬁc value of C has to be determined
by a physical experiment.
We expect that, in the singular resonance case, small perturbations of the external
force transform the one-parameter family (2.7) of motions into a perturbed one-
parameter family of motions. We will show below that this is true.
(i) Non-resonance case. Let ω > 0 with ω ̸= 1, 2, . . .. Then the inhomogeneous

singularities of the Green’s function correspond to the angular frequencies of

called the contraction principle) which was formulated by Banach (1892–1945)
in 1922.5
(ii) Resonance case. Let ω = 1. If we formally use the integral equation (2.9) and
the iterative method (2.10), then the approach breaks down because of the
singularity of the Green’s function (2.8) with k = 1. For example, the Born
approximation x1(.) is inﬁnite if ω = 1.
This is the typical trouble in physics if resonance occurs.
To overcome the diﬃculties in the resonance case, we will use the method of
the pseudo-resolvent introduced by Erhard Schmidt in 1908.6
Let us consider the anharmonic oscillator (2.1) in the case of the critical angular
frequency ω = 1. More precisely, we choose
ω2 = 1 + ε.
We also assume that the external force vanishes, that is, μ = 0. This means that
we want to study the problem
¨x(t) + (1 + ε)x(t) = −κx(t)3, t ∈R, x(0) = x(π) = 0.
(2.11)
This problem has the trivial solution x = 0, ε= arbitrary. We are interested in a
nontrivial solution. We will show that, for small real parameters κ, s, there exists a
nontrivial solution given by
x(t; κ, s) = s · sin t + . . . ,

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
The point is that we do not get a unique solution, but a family of solu-
tions which depend on an additional parameter s. This parameter has to
be determined by a physical experiment.
To explain this, suppose that we measure the motion x = x(t) and the angular
frequency ω of the motion. Then x(t) = x(t; κ, s) and ω = ω(κ, s).
• By (2.13), we obtain the parameter s.
• By (2.12), we obtain the value of the coupling constant
κ = 4(1 −ω2)
3s
.
This tells us that the coupling constant κ depends on s. Therefore, we call this
a running coupling constant.
This simple model corresponds to the (much more complicated) determination of
the electron charge, the electron mass, and the running coupling constant in quan-
tum electrodynamics. In particle physics, the running coupling constants of elec-
tromagnetic, weak, and strong interaction depend on energy and momentum of the
scattering process observed in a particle accelerator.
Sketch of the proof of (2.12). The following arguments are typical for a
branch of nonlinear analysis called bifurcation theory.7 First let us replace the
ill-posed linearized inhomogeneous problem (2.4) with ω = 1 by the well-posed
problem
¨x(t) + x(t) + b1(x) sin t = F(t), t ∈R, x(0) = x(π) = 0
(2.14)
where b1(x) :=
q
2
π
R π
0 x(t) sin t dt. The additional term b1(x) sin t is chosen in order
to guarantee that the homogeneous problem (2.14) has only the trivial solution
x = 0. The point is that the key relation (2.5) passes over to bk(1 −k2 + δk1) = βk
for k = 1, 2, . . . Hence
b1(x) = b1(F),
bk(x) = bk(F)
1 −k2 ,
k = 2, 3, . . .
More precisely, for given smooth odd 2π-periodic function F : R →R, problem
(2.14) has the unique solution

¨x(t) + x(t) + b1(x) sin t = −κx(t)3 −εx(t) + s sin t, x(0) = x(π) = 0

equivalent to
x(t) =

(a) First we solve the equation (2.15) by an iterative method. This way, we get the
function x = x(t; κ, s, ε) which depends on the small real parameters κ, s, ε.
(b) We solve the side condition
b1(x(.; κ, s, ε)) = s
by the implicit function theorem.8 This way, we get ε = ε(κ, s).
(c) The ﬁnal solution reads as x = x(t; κ, s, ε(κ, s)).
This yields the desired solution (2.12). The complete proof can be found in Vol. I,
Sect. 11.5.
The renormalized Green’s function. In quantum ﬁeld theory, physicists
use the notion of renormalized (or eﬀective) Green’s function. Let us explain this
in the case of the present simple model. The solution x = x(t; κ, s), ω = ω(κ, s)
satisﬁes the original equation
¨x(t; κ, s) + ω(κ, s)2x(t; κ, s) = −κx(t; κ, s)3
with the boundary condition x(0; κ, s) = x(π; κ, s) = 0. If κ and s are diﬀerent
from zero and suﬃciently small, then ω(κ, s) ̸= 1. That is, the angular frequency is
diﬀerent from the angular eigenfrequency ω = 1. Therefore, we can use the Green’s
function G as in the non-resonance case (2.8). This yields the integral equation
x(t; κ, s) = −κ

This function depends on the eﬀective angular frequency ω(κ, s) and is called the
eﬀective (or renormalized) Green’s function. In the 1940s and 1950s, physicists in-
vented approximative methods for computing eﬀective Green’s functions in quan-
tum electrodynamics and in more general quantum ﬁeld theories.
The renormalization group. It turns out that the parameter s of the solution
is not ﬁxed, but it can be rescaled (see Sect. 11.5.6 of Vol. I). This is the prototype
of the method of renormalization group.
8 In bifurcation theory, this side condition is called the bifurcation equation (see
(2.13)).

It is our goal to give this divergent series a well-deﬁned ﬁnite meaning.
In 1859 Riemann proved that the zeta function can be analytically continued to a
meromorphic function on the complex plane. This function has precisely one pole
which is located at the point s = 1 with the Laurent series

In 1790 Mascheroni published an approximation of γ to 32 decimal places (with
a mistake at the 20th decimal place). Therefore, the number γ is also called the

2.1.3 Meromorphic Functions and Mittag-Leﬄer’s Idea of
Subtractions
The method of subtractions plays a fundamental role in the renormalization of
quantum ﬁeld theories according to Bogoliubov, Parasiuk, Hepp, and Zimmermann
(called BPHZ renormalization).
The basic idea is to enforce convergence by subtracting additional terms
called subtractions.
Let us explain the classical background which can be traced back to Mittag-Leﬄer
(1846–1927). The prototype of the Mittag-Leﬄer theorem is the Euler formula
π cot(πz) = 1

«
(2.16)
for all complex numbers z diﬀerent from the integers 0, ±1, ±2, . . . More generally,
let f : C →C∪{∞} be a meromorphic function. By deﬁnition, this means that the
function f is holomorphic on the complex plane C up to an at most countable set
of isolated poles p1, p2, . . . In the neighborhood of each pole p = pj, we have the
Laurent series expansion
f(z) = Pp(z) +

X
k=0
ak(z −p)k
(2.17)
with the so-called principal part
Pp(z) :=
n
X
k=1
a−k
(z −p)k .
The formula (2.17) is valid in the largest pointed open disc
{z ∈C : 0 < |z −p | < r}
in which the given function f is holomorphic. The complex number a−1 is called
the residue of the function f at the pole p. For example, the function cot(πz) is
meromorphic with poles at the points 0, ±1, ±2, . . . At the pole p = 0, the Laurent
series reads as
cot(πz) = 1

(πz)2k−1,
0 < |z| < 1
with the principal part P(z) =

πz and the residue a−1 = 1
π at the pole z = 0. Let
us distinguish the following three cases.

2.1 Renormalization Theory in a Nutshell
57
(i) Entire function: If the function f is holomorphic on the complex plane, then it
is called an entire function. In this case, we have the power series expansion
f(z) =
∞
X
k=0
akzk
for all
z ∈C.
For example, the functions f(z) := ez, sin z, cos z are entire functions.
(ii) Finite number of poles. Suppose that the function f has the poles p1, . . . , pm.
Then there exists an entire function g such that
f(z) = g(z) +
m
X
k=1
Ppk(z)
for all z ∈C \ {p1, . . . , pm}. Here, Pp1, . . . , Ppm are the principal parts of f at
the poles.
(iii) Inﬁnite number of poles and subtractions. Suppose now that the function f
has the poles p1, p2, . . . We assume that |p1| ≤|p2| ≤. . . Motivated by (i), we
expect that
f(z) = g(z) +
∞
X
k=1
Ppk(z)
(2.18)
where g is an entire function. Unfortunately, this is not always true. It may
happen that the series P∞
k=1 Ppk(z) is not convergent.
The trouble with convergence frequently appears in physics when pass-
ing from a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom to an inﬁnite number
of degrees of freedom.
For example, in quantum ﬁeld theory, this concerns the passage from lattice
approximations to the continuum of the space-time manifold. It was the idea
of Mittag-Leﬄer to enforce the convergence of (2.18) by using
f(z) = g(z) +
∞
X
k=1
(Ppk(z) −ck(z))
(2.19)
with suitable polynomials ck called subtractions.11 To discuss this, assume ﬁrst
that p = 0 is not a pole of the function f. Then |pk| > 0 for all k. Introduce
the discs
Ck := {z ∈C : |z| ≤1
2|pk|},
k = 1, 2, . . .
By Taylor expansion,
Ppk(z) = bk0 + bk1z + . . . + bknkznk + . . .
for all
z ∈Ck.
Now choose the subtraction as the truncated Taylor expansion, that is,
ck(z) := bk0 + bk1z + . . . + bknkznk.
The crucial Mittag-Leﬄer theorem tells us the following:
11 These subtractions are also called counterterms. However, in this volume we will
reserve the terminology “counterterm” for additional terms in the Lagrangian.

58
2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
There exist positive integers n1, n2, . . . and an entire function g such
that the relation (2.19) holds for all z ∈C \ {p1, p2, . . .}.
This claim remains true if p = 0 is a pole of f. Then we choose c1 := 0. Let
us sketch the proof of the Mittag-Leﬄer theorem. The trick is to choose the
number nk in such a way that
|Ppk(z) −ck(z)| ≤1
2k
for all
z ∈Ck, k = 1, 2, . . .
Then the convergence of the series (2.19) follows from the convergence of
P∞
k=1
1
2k by applying the majorant criterion (see Problem 2.1).
In speciﬁc situations, the general Mittag-Leﬄer formula (2.19) can be simpliﬁed.
As an example, let us sketch the proof of the classical formula (2.16). We will use
Cauchy’s residue method. First introduce the function f(z) := π cot(πz) −1
z , and
choose the positively oriented circles
Cm := {z ∈C : |z| = m + 1
2},
m = 1, 2, . . .
The function f has the poles ±1, . . . , ±m inside the circle Cm. Let z be a point
inside the circle Cm which is not a pole of f. By Cauchy’s residue theorem,

2.1.4 The Square of the Dirac Delta Function
Formal approach. Physicists use the following formal deﬁnition
δ(t)2 := Tδ(t)
for all
t ∈R.
(2.20)
Here, T is the length of a typical time interval which corresponds to the physical
experiment under consideration. Similarly, physicists use
δ(x, y, z)2 = V δ(x, y, z)
for all
x, y, z ∈R.
Here, V is a typical volume. For scattering processes in particle physics, physicists
set δ(x, y, z, t) := δ(x, y, z)δ(t), and they write

59
δ(x, y, z, t)2 = V T · δ(x, y, z, t)
for all
x, y, z, t ∈R,
where the scattering process takes place in a box of volume V during the time
interval [−T
2 , T

can be discussed analogously.

Proposition 2.1 In the sense of tempered distributions, we have the following two
limits:
(i) limΔt→+0 δΔt = δ.
(ii) limΔt→+0 Δt · (δΔt)2 = δ.
Proof. Ad (i). For all test functions ϕ ∈S(R),

This is equal to ϕ(0). Finally, recall that δ(ϕ) = ϕ(0).
Ad (ii). For all Δt > 0,
(δΔt)2 = 1
Δt · δΔt.
This can be regarded as a motivation for (2.20) with T := 1/Δt. Furthermore,

δΔt(t)2ϕ(t)dt =

δΔt(t)ϕ(t)dt = ϕ(0).
2
This idea will be used in Chap. 15 in order to compute cross sections for scatter-
ing processes in quantum electrodynamics, by using limits of lattice approximations.
Rigorous extension. We are given a tempered distribution, F ∈S′(R), which
has the property that F(ϕ) = 0 for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R) with ϕ(0) = 0.
Proposition 2.2 Then there exists a complex number C such that F = Cδ.
Proof. Choose a ﬁxed test function χ ∈S(R) such that χ(0) = 1. It follows from
the decomposition ϕ = ϕ −χϕ(0) + χϕ(0) for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R) that
F(ϕ) = F(ϕ −χϕ(0)) + F(χϕ(0)) = F(χϕ(0)) = ϕ(0)F(χ) = F(χ)δ(ϕ).
2
This motivates the basic deﬁnition
δ2 := {Cδ :
C ∈C}.
By this deﬁnition, δ2 is not a single distribution, but a one-parameter family of
tempered distributions. This idea will be used in renormalization theory, in the
Epstein–Glaser approach to quantum ﬁeld theory. From the physical point of view,
the constant C describes an additional degree of freedom which has to be ﬁxed by
physical experiment.
Proposition 2.2 is a special case of the Steinmann extension theorem for distri-

2.2 Regularization of Divergent Integrals in Baby
Renormalization Theory
In order to distinguish between convergent and divergent integrals, we will use the
method of power-counting based on a cut-oﬀof the domain of integration. In terms
of physics, this cut-oﬀcorresponds to the introduction of an upper bound for the
admissible energies (resp. momenta). For the regularization of divergent integrals,
we will discuss the following methods used by physicists in renormalization theory:
(i) the method of diﬀerentiating parameter integrals,
(ii) the method of subtractions (including the famous overlapping divergences),
(iii) Pauli–Villars regularization,
(iv) dimensional regularization by means of Euler’s Gamma function,
(v) analytic regularization via integrals of Riemann–Liouville type, and
(vi) distribution-valued analytic functions.
2.2.1 Momentum Cut-oﬀand the Method of Power-Counting

Z ∞

pα :=

α > 1

if
α ≤1.

In fact, introducing the positive cut-oﬀPmax, we get

α = 1.
Finally, note that

pα .
In particular, if α = 1, then we say that the integral (2.21) diverges logarithmically.
In terms of physics, the variable p can be regarded as momentum, and the cut-
oﬀPmax is an upper bound for momentum. The limit Pmax →+∞is called the
ultraviolet limit in physics. In particular, if p is the momentum of a photon, then
it has the energy E = cp. If this energy is high, then the corresponding light wave
looks ultraviolet. Let f : [0, ∞[→R be a continuous function with the asymptotic
behavior12
f(p) ≃C
pα ,
p →∞
for ﬁxed real exponent α and ﬁxed real nonzero constant C.
Proposition 2.3 The integral
R ∞

f(p)dp is convergent if α > 1 (resp. divergent if
α ≤1).
12 This means that limp→+∞f(p)pα = C.

2.2 Regularization of Divergent Integrals in BabyRenormalization Theory

The proof follows from (2.21). This proposition tells us that we have to count the
power α. For example, let α > 0. The function
f(p) :=
1 + 4p2
1 + 2pα+2 ,
p ≥1
is asymptotically equal to
2
pα as p →+∞. Thus, the integral
R ∞

f(p)dp is conver-
gent if α > 1 (resp. divergent if α ≤1).

we say that the integral (a), (b), (c) possesses linear, quadratic and logarithmic
divergence, respectively.
Higher dimensions. Let N = 1, 2, 3, . . . Suppose that the continuous function
f : RN →R has the asymptotic behavior
f(p) ≃
C
|p|α ,
|p| →+∞
with the ﬁxed real exponent α and the ﬁxed real nonzero constant C.
Proposition 2.4 The integral
R
RN f(p)dNp is convergent if α > N (resp. divergent
if α ≤N).
This follows from Prop. 2.3 by using spherical coordinates. In fact, setting r := |p|,
we get

For example, let N = 2 and α > 0. Choose
f(p) :=

1 + 2|p|α+2 ,
p ∈R2
where p = (p1, p2) and |p| =

2. Then the integral

R2 f(p)d2p is convergent
if α > 2 (resp. divergent if α ≤2).
A sophisticated reﬁnement of the results above is given by Weinberg’s power-
counting theorem (see Sect. 11.6.3 of Vol. I).
Asymptotic expansions and regularization of divergent integrals by
subtraction. Let us consider two simple examples.
(i) First example (one subtraction): We want to regularize the divergent integral
J(P) :=
Z ∞
1
dp
p + P
(2.22)
with the ﬁxed parameter P > 0. In physics, the parameter P describes the momen-
tum of an incoming or outgoing particle of a scattering process. The integrand has
the following asymptotic behavior

p + P ≃1
p,
p →+∞

62
2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
which is responsible for the divergence of the integral by power-counting. In order to
regularize the integral, we subtract some function from the integrand which cancels
the bad asymptotic behavior as p →+∞. To this end, we replace
1
p+P by
1
p + P −1
p = −
P
p(p + P).
Since this is asymptotically equal to −P
p2 as p →+∞, the regularized integral
Jreg(P) :=
Z ∞
1
„
1
p + P −1
p
«
dp
is convergent by power-counting. Mnemonically, we write
Jreg(P) = J(P) −J(0).
(2.23)
However, this is not a rigorous relation, since J(P) = +∞and J(0) = +∞.
(ii) Second example (two successive subtractions). The integral
J(P) =
Z ∞
1
pdp
p + P ,
P > 0
is divergent. Since
p
p+P ≃1 as p →+∞, we pass to the new integrand
g(p) :=
p
p + P −1 = −
P
p + P
by subtraction. However, since g(p) ≃−P
p as p →+∞, the integral
R ∞
1
g(p)dp is
still divergent. Continuing the subtraction method, we pass to the integrand
g(p) −
„

(p + P)p.
This leads us to the deﬁnition of the regularized integral
Jreg(P) :=

(p + P)p,
P > 0
which is convergent by power-counting. Using analytic continuation, the function
P →Jreg(P) makes sense for all complex numbers P in the subset C\] −∞, −1] of
the complex plane. Mnemonically,
Jreg(P) = J(P) −J(0) −PJ′(0).

In fact, this stands for the expression
Jreg(P) =

2.2.2 The Choice of the Normalization Momentum
The divergent integral J(P) :=
R ∞
1
dp
p+P with P > 0 considered above can also be
regularized by ﬁxing the parameter P0 > 0 and replacing (2.23) by the mnemonic
relation
Jreg(P) = J(P) −J(P0).
Rigorously, we deﬁne
Jreg(P) :=
Z ∞
1
„
1
p + P −
1
p + P0
«
dp = (P0 −P)
Z ∞
1
dp
(p + P)(p + P0).
This integral is convergent by power-counting. Note that the regularized integral
Jreg(P) depends on the choice of the momentum P0, which is called the normaliza-
tion momentum.
In terms of physics, the choice of P0 can be determined by the typical
momentum of the physical experiment under consideration.
For example, in particle accelerators the scattered particles have a ﬁxed momentum,
and hence a ﬁxed energy. It turns out that the physics changes if the particle energy
changes. This is the phenomenon of the running coupling constant in the Standard
Model of particle physics.
Summarizing, regularization (and hence renormalization) methods produce
additional parameters which have to be determined by physical experiments.
The role of the renormalization group in physics. The change of the
normalizing momentum is governed by a transformation which is described by the
so-called renormalization group. In particular, this is crucial for studying the high-
energy behavior of quantum ﬁeld theories (see Chap. 3 of Vol. I on scale changes in
physics). For example, quarks behave like free particles at very high energies. This
is the so-called asymptotic freedom of quarks.13
Oﬀ-shell versus on-shell normalization. Recall that the 4-momentum p =
(p0, p1, p2, p3) of an elementary particle (in an inertial system) corresponds to the
momentum vector p = p1i + p2j + p3k and the energy E = cp0 where c denotes the
velocity of light in a vacuum. If the particle has the rest mass m0, then
|p0|2 −|p1|2 −|p2|2 −|p3|2 = c2m2
0.
(2.25)
This corresponds to the energy relation E2 = (m0c2)2 + c2p2. By deﬁnition, the 4-
momentum p is on-shell (resp. oﬀ-shell) iﬀthe mass-shell relation (2.25) is satisﬁed
(resp. not satisﬁed).
2.2.3 The Method of Diﬀerentiating Parameter Integrals
Improve the convergence behavior of a parameter-depending integral by
diﬀerentiation with respect to the parameter.
Folklore
13 For the discovery of the asymptotic freedom of quarks, David Gross, David
Politzer and Frank Wilczek were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 2004.

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
Consider again the divergent integral
J(P) =
Z ∞
1
dp
p + P ,
P > 0.
Formal diﬀerentiation with respect to the parameter P yields the convergent inte-
gral
J′(P) = −
Z ∞

dp
(p + P)2 = −
1
1 + P ,
P > 0.
The diﬀerential equation
J′(P) = −
1
1 + P ,
P > 0
has the general solution J(P) = C −ln(1 + P), with the arbitrary real constant C.
Therefore, we deﬁne the regularized integral by setting
Jreg(P) := C −ln(1 + P),
P > 0.
Note that the function J represents a family of functions which depends on the real
parameter C.
In the general case, consider the divergent integral
J(P) =
Z ∞
1
f(p, P)dp,
P ∈Π
where Π is an open interval. Let n = 1, 2, . . . The formal n-th derivative with
respect to the parameter P looks like
J(n)(P) =
Z ∞

∂nf(p, P)
∂P n
dp,
P ∈Π.
Suppose that the integrals are divergent for n = 1, 2, . . . , N −1, whereas the integral
JN)(P) is convergent for all P ∈Π. Then we deﬁne the regularized integral Jreg(P)
by means of the diﬀerential equation
J(N)
reg (P) = J(N)(P),
P ∈Π.
(2.26)
Let J = J(P) be a special solution of this diﬀerential equation. Then we use the
general solution of (2.26) in order to deﬁne
Jreg(P) := C0 + C1P + . . . + CN−1P N−1 + J(P),
P ∈Π.
Here, C0, . . . , CN−1 are arbitrary real parameters. In physics, these free parameters
have to be determined by experiment.
2.2.4 The Method of Taylor Subtraction
Let us generalize (2.23) and (2.24). To this end, consider the divergent integral
J(P) =
Z ∞
1
f(p, P) dp,
P ∈Π.

2.2 Regularization of Divergent Integrals in BabyRenormalization Theory

Choose the normalization point P0 in the open interval Π. Let n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Mnemonically, we set
JregP) = J(P) −J(P0) −(P −P0)J′(P0) −. . . −(P −P0)n

J(n)(P0).
Here, we assume that, for ﬁxed n, the corresponding integral is convergent for all
parameters P ∈Π and that n is the smallest number with this property. This is
called the method of minimal (Taylor) subtraction. In terms of integrands, we get
Jreg(P) =

2.2.5 Overlapping Divergences
Overlapping divergences caused a lot of trouble in the history of renormal-
ization theory.14
Folklore
As a prototype for an integral with overlapping divergences, consider the divergent
integral
J(P) =
Z ∞
1
Z ∞
1
f(p, q, P)dpdq,
P > 0
with the integrand
f(p, q, P) :=
p
p + P ·
1
p + q ·
q
q + P .
Fix the parameter P > 0. The point is that
•
R ∞
1
f(p, q, P)dp = +∞for all q ≥1,
• and
R ∞
1
f(p, q, P)dq = +∞for all p ≥1
by power-counting. This means that the integral is divergent if either of the inte-
gration variables p and q is ﬁxed. We call this an overlapping divergence. In order
to regularize the integral J(P), we will use the following subtractions with respect
to the parameter P.
(i) Minimal subtraction concerning the one-dimensional p-integral.
(ii) Minimal subtraction concerning the one-dimensional q-integral.
(iii) Minimal subtraction of the result from (i) and (ii) concerning the two-
dimensional (p, q)-integral.
Ad (i). For ﬁxed q ≥1, we have f(p, q, P) ≃
q
q+P · 1
p as p →+∞. Therefore, we
replace f(p, q, P) by
f(p, q, P) −
q
q + P · 1
p.
Ad (ii). For ﬁxed p ≥1, we have f(p, q, P) ≃
p
p+P · 1
q as q →+∞. Therefore,
we pass over to
g(p, q, P) := f(p, q, P) −
q
(q + P)p −
p
(p + P)q .
14 See the quotation on page 974.

This yields the integral
G(P) =

g(p, q, P)dqdp,

with the integrand
g(p, q, P) = −p2q2 + pq3 + p3q + P(p3 + p2q + pq2 + q3)
p(p + P)(p + q)(q + P)q
.
Power-counting shows that the integral G(P) is still divergent. To show this, note
that for all p, q ≥1, we get
p2q2
p(p + P)(p + q)(q + P)q ≥

(p + P) · 2 · (q + P).

(q + P) = +∞.
Ad (iii). Mnemonically, we deﬁne Jreg(P) := G(P)−G(0)−PG′(0) with P > 0.
Rigorously, this gives the deﬁnition of the regularized integral:
Jreg(P) :=
Z ∞
1
Z ∞
1
greg(p, q, P)dpdq.
Here, the regularized integrand greg(p, q, P) is equal to
g(p, q, P) −g(p, q, 0) −P ∂g(p, q, 0)
∂P
= −
P 2pq + P 3(p + q)
p(p + P)(p + q)(q + P)q .
Proposition 2.5 The regularized integral Jreg(P)is convergent.
Proof. For example, consider the subintegral
A :=
Z ∞
1
Z ∞
1
pq dpdq
p(p + P)(p + q)(q + P)q .
From (√p −√q)2 ≥0, we get √p√q ≤1
2(p + q) for all p, q ≥0. Hence
1
p + q ≤
1
2√p√q
for all
p, q > 0.
This implies
A ≤1

(q + P)√q dq < ∞
by power-counting. Analogously, we obtain the convergence of the remaining subin-
tegrals.

will be discussed in Example 2 on page 985.

2.2.6 The Role of Counterterms
The method of subtractions changes the integrands by subtracting regularizing
terms in order to enforce convergence of the integrals. Physicists try to connect the
subtraction terms with additional terms in the Lagrangian of the quantum ﬁeld
theory under consideration. These additional terms of the Lagrangian are called
counterterms. It is one of the tasks of renormalization theory
• to study the structure of the necessary subtraction terms and
• to show that the subtraction terms can be generated by appropriate counterterms
of the classical Lagrangian (see Chap. 16).
The philosophy behind this approach is that the procedure of quantization adds
quantum eﬀects to the classical ﬁeld theory. These quantum eﬀects can be described
by changing the classical Lagrangian by adding counterterms.
2.2.7 Euler’s Gamma Function
Let us summarize some classical formulas which will be used for the dimensional
regularization of divergent multi-dimensional integrals below. Recall that the facto-
rial symbol n! stands for the product 1 · 2 · · · n. For example 3! = 6. By convention,
0! := 1. Hence
n! = n · (n −1)!,
n = 1, 2, . . .
In 1729 it was Euler’s aim to extrapolate the discrete values n! to a smooth function
Γ :]0, ∞[→R with the property Γ(1) = 1 and
Γ(x + 1) = xΓ(x)
for all
x > 0.
Euler constructed such a function by means of the convergent integral
Γ(x) :=
Z ∞
0
tx−1e−t dt
for all
x > 0.
In 1811 Gauss showed that this function can be extended to a meromorphic function
Γ : C →C ∪{∞}. He used the inﬁnite product
Γ(z) = lim
n→∞
n!nz
z(z + 1) · · · (z + n)
for all
z ∈C \ {0, −1, −2, . . .}.
The gamma function has the following properties:15
• Γ(1) = 1 and Γ(z + 1) = zΓ(z) for all z ∈C \ {0, −1, −2, . . .} (functional
equation). Hence Γ(n) = (n −1)! if n = 1, 2, . . . Explicitly,
Γ(z) = 1
z + O(1),
z →0.
(2.27)
15 The proofs can be found in R. Remmert, Classical Topics in Complex Function
Theory, Chap. 2, Springer, New York, 1998.

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
• More generally, the gamma function is a meromorphic function on the complex
plane. It has precisely the poles 0, −1, −2, . . . . Each pole is simple and has the
residue
res−kΓ = (−1)k
k!
,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Therefore,
Γ(z −k) =
(−1)k
k!(z + k) + O(1),
z →0,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
We deﬁne the regularized value by
Γ(−k)reg := lim
z→0
„
Γ(z −k) −
(−1)k
k!(z + k)
«
,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
These limits are well deﬁned.
• More precisely, in a neighborhood of the origin we have the Laurent series ex-
pansion
Γ(z) = 1
z −γ +
„γ2
2 + π2

«

where γ = 0.577 . . .
is the Euler constant. Truncating the singularity at the
point z = 0 and letting z →0, we obtain Γreg(0) = −γ.
• In a neighborhood of the pole z = −1, we have the Laurent series expansion16
Γ(z −1) = −1
z + γ −1 −
„γ2
2 + π2
12 + γ
«
z + O(z2),
(2.29)
as z →0. Therefore, Γreg(−1) = γ −1.
• The gamma function has no zeros. The reciprocal function 1/Γ is an entire
function with the Weierstrass product representation

Γ(z) = zeγz

• Γ(z) :=

tz−1e−tdt for all complex numbers z with ℜ(z) > 0.
• Euler’s supplement: For all complex numbers z which are not integers, we have
Γ(z)Γ(1 −z) =
π
sin πz ,
and Γ(z)Γ(−z) = −
π
z sin πz . In particular, Γ( 1
2) = √π.
• Legendre’s duplication formula:
Γ(2z) = 22z−1

Γ(z)Γ(z + 1
2).
This is true for all complex numbers z diﬀerent from 0, −1

• Special values: Γ(n + 1

• The asymptotic Stirling formula for real arguments x:
Γ(x + 1) ≃

x →+∞.
The gamma function is uniquely determined by its functional equation. More pre-
cisely, Wielandt proved the following theorem in 1939: Consider the half-plane
H := {z ∈C : ℜ(z) > 0}. Suppose that the function F : H →C is holomorphic and
satisﬁes the functional equation
F(1) = 1,
F(z + 1) = zF(z)
for all
z ∈H.
Moreover, let |F(z)| be bounded on the strip {z ∈C : 1 ≤ℜ(z) < 2}. Then F = Γ
on H.
Let p and q be complex numbers with positive real part, ℜ(p), ℜ(q) > 0. Then
the integral
B(p, q) :=
Z 1
0
xp−1(1 −x)q−1 dx
(2.30)
exists, and we have the famous Euler identity
B(p, q) = Γ(p)Γ(q)
Γ(p + q) .
(2.31)
The function B is called the Euler beta function.
Finally, we want to show that the gamma function allows us to compute the
surface measure of the unit sphere SN−1 in RN. To ﬁx the terminology, choose the
dimension N = 2, 3, . . . . For each point p ∈RN, we set |p| :=
p
(p1)2 + . . . + (pN)2.
Deﬁne the (N −1)-dimensional unit sphere SN−1 := {p ∈RN : |p| = 1}. Then the
surface measure of SN−1 is given by the Jacobi formula
meas(SN−1) = 2π
N
2
Γ
` N

´.
(2.32)
For example, we get meas(S1) = 2π and meas(S2) = 4π for the length of the
unit circle and the surface measure of the 2-dimensional unit sphere, respectively.
An elegant proof will be given in Problem 2.3. Moreover, for the volume of the
N-dimensional ball BN
R := {x ∈RN : |x| ≤R} of radius R, we get
V (BN
R ) = meas(SN−1)RN

In fact, we have V (BN

2.2.8 Integration Tricks
Let us summarize some integration tricks which are frequently applied in quantum
ﬁeld theory.
The sphere trick. Let f : [0, ∞[→C be a continuous function. Fix the dimen-
sion N = 2, 3, . . .. Moreover, suppose that sup0≤r<∞rN−1+α|f(r)| < ∞for ﬁxed
α > 1. Then the following integral is absolutely convergent:

.
(2.35)
Here, we assume that f and g are polynomials such that the degree condition
degree(g)-degree(f)≥2 is satisﬁed, and the function
f
g has no poles on the real
axis. In equation (2.35), we sum over all poles z1, . . . , zK of the function f
g on the
upper half-plane. If there is no such pole, then the integral from (2.35) is equal
to zero. For computations, it is convenient to know that the following hold: If the
function f
g has a pole of order n = 1, 2, . . . at the point zk, then the residue of this
pole is given by

In fact, the equation p2 −(a + iε)2 = 0 has the simple zero p+ := a + iε on the

This coincides with the result obtained above. Physicists use this trick in order
to reduce algebraic Feynman integrals on Minkowski space to the corresponding
integrals on Euclidean space (see Sect. 2.2.12 on page 80). The goal of the following
three tricks due to Feynman, Schwinger and Pauli–Villars is to simplify the structure
of algebraic Feynman integrals.
The Feynman integration trick. For all nonzero real numbers a, b, we have

(2.44)
That is, the integral is divergent of logarithmic type. Such slowly divergent integrals
frequently occur in renormalization theory. In order to regularize the integral (2.44),
we will use the following key formula18

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
In the classical sense, this so-called Liouville integral exists for all parameters
a, b, β, γ > 0,
βγ −α > 1.
Using analytic continuation and the regularization of the gamma function, the
integral (2.45) can be easily extended to a larger parameter domain. For example,
we obtain the following two regularized integrals
»Z ∞

In order to motivate the deﬁnition (2.46), choose the parameter ε > 0. Then we
have the classical integral
Z ∞

dr
(1 + r2)

2 +ε = Γ( 1

2Γ( 1

By (2.28), this is equal to
Γ( 1

2Γ( 1
2 + ε)
„1
ε −γ + O(ε)
«
,
ε →0.
Truncating the singular term 1
ε and letting ε →0, we get (2.46). Furthermore, the
deﬁnition (2.47) is motivated by using the key equation (2.45) with the parameter
values a = b := 1, α := 0, β := 2, and γ := −1
4. Note that the values Γ( 1
2), Γ(−3
4)
and Γ(−1
4) are well-deﬁned, since the meromorphic gamma function has only poles
at the points 0, −1, −2, . . .
Dimensional regularization of integrals. Let N = 2, 3, . . . We want to
study the integral
JN(f) :=
Z
RN f(|p|) dNp.
By the sphere trick (2.34) on page 70, we have the key formula
JN(f) = 2π

f(r)rN−1dr.
(2.48)
The point is that the right-hand side of (2.48) is not only deﬁned for the integer
dimensions N = 2, 3, . . ., but also for more general values of the parameter N. Ob-
serve that the interpolating gamma function is uniquely determined by Wielandt’s
uniqueness theorem considered above. Now the method of dimensional regulariza-
tion proceeds as follows. We want to regularize the divergent integral JN0(f) for
ﬁxed N0 = 2, 3, . . .
• To this end, we choose the parameter N = N0 −ε, and we compute JN0−ε(f) by
(2.48).
• We truncate the singularity of the function ε →JN0−ε at the point ε = 0. This
way, we get the regularized expression [JN0−ε(f)]reg.

2.2 Regularization of Divergent Integrals in BabyRenormalization Theory
75
• Finally, we deﬁne the regularized integral
[JN0(f)]reg := lim
ε→+0[JN0−ε(f)]reg.
Let us illustrate this with the integral
JN :=
Z
RN
dNp
(a2 + |p|2)2 ,
N = 2, 3, 4
for all parameters a > 0. This integral behaves like
R ∞

rN−5dr. Consequently, if
N = 2, 3 (resp. N = 4), the integral is convergent (resp. divergent). We want to
motivate the regularization
»Z
R4
d4p
(a2 + |p|2)2
–
reg

(2.49)
To begin with, we set N = 4 −2ε where ε > 0. By the key formula (2.48),
J4−2ε =
2π2−ε
Γ(2 −ε)
Z ∞
0
r3−2εdr
(a2 + r2)2 .
Using the Liouville integral (2.45), we obtain
J4−2ε =
2π2−ε
Γ(2 −ε) · a4−2εΓ(2 −ε)Γ(ε)
2a4Γ(2)
= π2−ε
a2ε · Γ(ε).
The Laurent series (2.28) of the gamma function at the pole ε = 0 tells us that
J4−2ε = π2−ε
a2ε
„1
ε −γ + O(ε)
«
,
ε →0.
Truncating the singular term 1
ε, we get the regularization
[J4−2ε]reg := π2−ε
a2ε (−γ + O(ε)) ,
ε →0.
(2.50)
Finally, letting ε →+0, we obtain (2.49).
Historical remarks. Dimensional regularization was introduced by Gerardus
’t Hooft and Martinus Veltman in 1972.19 They showed that, in contrast to the 1938
Fermi model, the electroweak Standard Model in particle physics is renormalizable.
For this, ’t Hooft and Veltman were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1999.
Dimensional regularization is the standard method used by physicists in
modern renormalization theory.20

Nucl. Phys. B44 (1972), 189–213. See also the monograph by M. Veltman, Dia-
grammatica: the Path to Feynman Diagrams, Cambridge University Press, 1995.
20 Observe that dimensional regularization fails if the Dirac matrix γ5 is involved,
which corresponds to the appearance of chirality (processes with parity viola-
tion). In this case, one has to use other regularization methods like algebraic
renormalization (see the quotation in Sect. 19.6 on page 1019).

p(p + PM).
In terms of physics, PM = cM is the momentum of an additional (ghost) particle
of mass M.21 Explicitly,
Jreg(PM) = ln PM.
In fact, the Pauli–Villars regularized integral Jreg(PM) is equal to the limit

Pmax →+∞,
• corresponds to the logarithmic divergence Jreg(PM) = ln PM of the regularized

integral
J :=

by Problem 2.10. This diﬀerentiation is admissible, since both Jreg(M 2) and the
derivative J′
reg(M 2) are convergent integrals. Noting that Jreg(m2) = 0, we get
Jreg(M 2) = π2(ln M 2 −ln m2).

Comparison of the Pauli–Villars method with dimensional regular-
ization. By (2.50), dimensional regularization of J yields
J4−2ε =
π2−ε

ε −γ + O(ε)
«
,
ε →0.
Comparing this with Prop. 2.7, we see that
• the logarithmic growth Jreg(M 2) = ln M 2 −ln m2 as M →+∞of the Pauli–
Villars regularization corresponds to
• the pole of the dimensional regularization J4−2ε at the point ε = 0.
The Pauli–Villars regularization preserves the relativistic invariance. However, the
introduction of additional masses may destroy the gauge invariance.

To this end, we start with the convergent integral

(p + P0)λ ,
λ > 1.
Explicitly, we get22
Jλ(P0) = P 1−λ

λ −1
for all
λ > 1.
Using analytic continuation, we deﬁne
Jλ(P0)|reg := P 1−λ

counting. Using the Liouville integral formula (2.45) on page 73, we obtain

Here (m −iε)1−2λ = e(1−2λ) ln(m−iε), where ln(m −iε) denotes the principal value

λ = 0, −1, −2, . . .

Since the nonnegative integrand (x, u) →

The important mathematical problem of evaluating (algebraic) Feynman
integrals arises quite naturally in elementary particle physics when one
treats various quantities (corresponding to Feynman diagrams) in the
framework of perturbation theory.24
Vladimir Smirnov, 2006
Fix the mass parameter m > 0 and the regularizing parameter ε > 0. Our goal is
to compute the integral
Jλ(m, ε) =
Z

d4p
(c2(m −iε)2 −p2)λ .
(2.52)
Here, p = (p0, p1, p2, p3), and p2 := |p0|2 −P3
j=1 |pj|2. Introducing the energy
E := cp0 and the momentum vector p, we get
p2 := E2
c2 −p2
(2.53)
where c denotes the velocity of light in a vacuum. To simplify notation, we set
c := 1.
Wick rotation. Let λ > 3. By deﬁnition, the integral is to be understood as
the following iterated integral:
Jλ(m, ε) :=

((m −iε)2 −E2 + p2)λ .
By Wick rotation,25
Z ∞

((m −iε)2 −E2 + p2)λ =
Z i∞

dE
((m −iε)2 −E2 + p2)λ .
Replacing the variable E by iE, this integral is equal to
i
Z ∞

((m −iε)2 + E2 + p2)λ .
Hence
Jλ(m, ε) = i
Z

Using the sphere trick (2.34) on page 70, we get
Jλ(m, ε) = 2iπ2

r3dr
((m −iε)2 + r2)λ .
The Liouville integral (2.45) on page 73 tells us that26

Γ(λ)
= iπ2(m −iε)4−2λ
(λ −1)(λ −2) ,

2.2.13 Distribution-Valued Meromorphic Functions
In quantum ﬁeld theory, Green’s functions are closely related to distribu-
tion-valued meromorphic functions.
Folklore
The following considerations will be used in the next section in order to study
Newton’s equation of motion in terms of the Fourier transform of tempered distri-
butions. For the convenience of the reader, our approach will be chosen in such a
way that it serves as a prototype for the study of Green’s functions in quantum
ﬁeld theory later on. The essential tool is given by families of tempered distribu-
tions which analytically depend on a complex parameter λ. This approach dates
back to a fundamental paper by Marcel Riesz in 1948.27
Basic idea. We want to study the integral
Z ∞

tλϕ(t)dt
(2.54)
for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R) and all complex numbers λ. If ℜ(λ) > −1, then the
integral is convergent. However, if ℜ(λ) ≤−1 and ϕ(0) ̸= 0, then the integral is
divergent. The idea is to use analytic continuation with respect to λ. For example,
if −2 < ℜ(λ) < −1, then we will show below that the analytic continuation of the
integral looks like
Z ∞

tλϕ(t)dt = ϕ(0)

To begin with, we deﬁne t+ := θ(t)t for all t ∈R. Hence
t+ =

t ≥0,

if
t < 0.
The classical function t →t+ corresponds to a tempered distribution denoted by
t+(ϕ) :=
Z ∞
−∞
t+ϕ(t)dt
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Observe the following crucial fact. If we set f(t) := (t+)−3/2, then the classical
function f is not deﬁned for arguments t ≤0. However, the tempered distribution
t−3/2
+
to be introduced below is well deﬁned. But it cannot be represented by a
classical, locally integrable function.
The tempered distribution tλ
+. For all complex numbers λ with positive real
part, ℜ(λ) > 0, we deﬁne the tempered distribution tλ
+ given by
tλ
+(ϕ) :=
Z ∞
−∞
tλ
+ϕ(t)dt
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Hence tλ
+(ϕ) :=
R ∞
0
tλ
+ϕ(t)dt for all ϕ ∈S(R) where tλ
+ = eλ ln t if t > 0.
Proposition 2.8 Let ϕ ∈S(R). The function λ →tλ
+(ϕ) deﬁned on the open half-
plane {λ ∈C : ℜ(λ) > 0} can be analytically extended to a holomorphic function on
the punctured complex plane C \ {−1, −2, . . .}. Explicitly, choose k = 1, 2, . . . and
the complex number λ with ℜ(λ) > −k and λ ̸= −1, −2, . . . , −k + 1. Then

We say that the map λ →tλ
+ is a meromorphic function on the complex plane C
with values in the space S′(R) of tempered distributions. This function has simple
poles at the points λ = −1, −2, . . . with the residues
resλ=−k(tλ
+) = (−1)k−1δ(k−1)
(k −1)!
,
k = 1, 2, . . .
Proof. Fix the test function ϕ ∈S(R). We will proceed by induction.
(I) Let k = 1. We start with tλ
+(ϕ) =
R ∞
0
tλϕ(t) dt for ℜ(λ) > 0. Obviously, if
ℜ(λ) > 0, then tλ
+(ϕ) is equal to

λ+1. The point is that the function λ →yλ
+(ϕ) is
holomorphic for all complex numbers λ with ℜ(λ) > −1. This follows from ϕ(t) −
ϕ(0) = O(t) as t →0. In fact, the Taylor expansion theorem tells us that
|tλ(ϕ(t) −ϕ(0))| ≤tλ+1 sup
0≤τ≤t
|ϕ′(τ)|,
t ∈[0, 1].
Hence
yλ

0
tλ(ϕ(t) −ϕ(0)) dt +
Z ∞

tλϕ(t) dt + ϕ(0)
λ + 1,
ℜ(λ) > −1.
Thus, the function λ →yλ
+(ϕ) (deﬁned for ℜ(λ) > −1) is an analytic continuation
of the function λ →tλ
+(ϕ) (deﬁned for ℜ(λ) > 0).
(II) Let k = 2. For all complex numbers λ with ℜ(λ) > −1, the value yλ
+(ϕ) is
equal to
zλ
+(ϕ) :=
Z 1

tλ(ϕ(t) −ϕ(0) −ϕ′(0)t) dt +

tλ+1 dt + ϕ(0)
Z 1

tλdt = ϕ′(0)
λ + 2 + ϕ(0)
λ + 1.
By Taylor expansion, ϕ(t)−ϕ(0)−ϕ′(0)t = O(t2) as t →0. Thus, the function λ →
zλ
+(ϕ) is holomorphic on {λ ∈C : ℜ(λ) > −2} \ {−1}. Consequently, the function
λ →zλ
+(ϕ) (deﬁned for ℜ(λ) > −2 with λ ̸= −1) is an analytic continuation of the
function λ →yλ
+(ϕ) (deﬁned for ℜ(λ) > −1).
(III) An induction argument for k = 1, 2, . . . yields the desired result.

Proposition 2.9 The tempered distribution t+ has the following properties:
(i) ¨t+ = δ.
(ii) t+ = 0 on ] −∞, 0[.

where H corresponds to the linear function H(t) := a+bt for all t ∈R with arbitrary
complex numbers a, b as coeﬃcients.
(iv) The equation ¨x = δ, x ∈S′(R) with x = 0 on ] −∞, 0[ has precisely one

28 Recall that we also write ¨x or x′′ instead of d2x

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
Because of (iv), t+ is called the retarded tempered fundamental solution of the
diﬀerential operator

Ad (ii). If the test function ϕ ∈S(R) vanishes outside ] −∞, 0[, then t+(ϕ) =

−∞t+ϕ(t)dt = 0.
Ad (iii). Let H ∈S′(R) with ¨H = 0. Note that sing supp t+ = {0} (see page 704
of Vol. I). By Theorem 8.16 on page 745, the diﬀerential operator
d2
dt2 is hypoelliptic,
that is, the tempered distribution H corresponds to a smooth function t →H(t).
From ¨H(t) ≡0 it follows that H(t) = a + bt for all t ∈R.
Finally, let x ∈S′(R) with ¨x = δ. Set H := x −t+. Then ¨H = 0.
Ad (iv). If a + bt = 0 for all t < 0, then a = b = 0.

According to the general theory of distributions, the following hold (see Sect.
11.7 of Vol. I). Let F ∈D′(R) be a given distribution with compact support. Then
the equation
¨x = F,
x ∈D′(R)
(2.57)
has the special solution x = t+ ∗F and the general solution
x = t+ ∗F + H
(2.58)
where H corresponds to the linear function H(t) = at+b for all t ∈R with complex
coeﬃcients a, b. In particular, if F : R →R is continuous with compact support,
then (2.58) looks like
x(t) =

(t −τ)+F(τ)dτ + H(t) =
Z t

(t −τ)F(τ)dτ + H(t)
(2.59)
for all t ∈R.
The tempered distribution tλ

function t−:= −θ(−t)t for all t ∈R. Then
t−=

for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
As for t+, we get the following. The function λ →tλ

plane {λ ∈C : ℜ(λ) > 0} can be analytically extended to a holomorphic function
on the punctured complex plane C \ {−1, −2, . . .}. Explicitly, choose k = 1, 2, . . .

(ii) t−= 0 on ]0, ∞[.
(iii) The general tempered fundamental solution of the diﬀerential operator

looks like

where H corresponds to the linear function H(t) := a+bt for all t ∈R with arbitrary

(iv) The equation ¨x = δ, x ∈S′(R) with x = 0 on ]0, ∞[ has precisely one
solution given by t−.
Because of (iv), t−is called the advanced tempered fundamental solution of the
diﬀerential operator

Note that the common poles −2, −4, . . . of tλ

for all complex numbers λ with ℜ(λ) > 0, we have29

for all

The holomorphic function λ →|t|λ

be analytically continued to a holomorphic function on C \ {−1, −3, . . .} which has

This follows from ¨t+ = δ and ¨t−= δ. Naturally enough,

Let λ ∈C. For any test function ϕ ∈S(R), we deﬁne

2.2.14 Application to Newton’s Equation of Motion
Consider the following initial-value problem
m¨x(t) = F(t),
t ∈R,
x(0) = a,
˙x(0) = v.
(2.61)
This describes the motion of a particle of mass m > 0 on the real line with the
initial position a and the initial velocity v at time t = 0. We want to discuss this
classical problem by using a language which can be generalized to quantum ﬁeld
theory. To simplify notation, we set m := 1.
If F : R →R is continuous, then the unique solution of (2.61) reads as
x(t) = a + vt +
Z t

(t −τ)F(τ)dτ
for all
t ∈R.
This solution formula can be written as

t ∈R,

with the Green’s function
G(t, τ) :=

τ ≥0,
(t −τ)−
if
τ < 0.
Fundamental Solutions in the Time Space
Let F ∈D′(R) be a distribution with compact support. If g ∈D′(R) is a funda-
mental solution of
d2
dt2 , that is, ¨g = δ, then the distribution
x = g ∗F
is a solution of the Newtonian equation ¨x = F, by the general theory of distributions
(see Sect. 11.7 of Vol. I). In particular, suppose that the force function F : R →F
is continuous with compact support. This means that there exists a compact time
interval [t1, t2] such that
F(t) = 0
for all
t /∈[t0, t1].
Choosing the fundamental solutions t+, t−, 1
2|t|, we get the following special solu-
tions of the Newtonian equation for all t ∈R:

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
• Retarded solution xret = t+ ∗F:
xret(t) =
Z ∞
−∞
(t −τ)+F(τ)dτ =
Z t
−∞
(t −τ)F(τ)dτ.
The retarded solution is the unique solution of the initial-value problem32
m¨x(t) = F(t),
t ∈R,
x(t1) = 0,
˙x(t1) = 0.
Alternatively, the retarded solution is the unique solution of the Newtonian equa-
tion m¨x(t) = F(t), t ∈R, which vanishes in a neighborhood of the point in time
t = −∞. This corresponds to the motion of a particle that rests in a neighbor-
hood of t = −∞. This motion is quite natural because the force vanishes near
time t = −∞(remote past).
• Advanced solution xadv = t−∗F :
xadv(t) =
Z ∞
−∞
(t −τ)−F(τ)dτ = −
Z ∞
t
(t −τ)F(τ)dτ.
The advanced solution is the unique solution of the initial-value problem
m¨x(t) = F(t),
t ∈R,
x(t2) = 0,
˙x(t2) = 0.
Alternatively, the advanced solution is the unique solution of the Newtonian
equation m¨x(t) = F(t), t ∈R, which vanishes in a neighborhood of the point
in time t = +∞. This corresponds to the motion of a particle that rests in a
neighborhood of t = +∞. This motion is quite natural because the force vanishes
near time t = +∞(far future).
• Retarded-advanced solution xret/adv(t) = 1
2|t| ∗F:
xret/adv = 1
2(xret(t) + xadv(t)) =
Z ∞
−∞

2|t −τ| F(τ)dτ.
Note that the retarded solution xret(t) at time t only depends on the values of the
force F on the time interval ] −∞, t] in the past. This motivates the terminology
‘retarded’.
The advanced solution xadv(t) at time t only depends on the values of the
force F on the time interval ] −∞, t] in the future. This motivates the terminology
‘advanced’. Moreover, the retarded-advanced solution is the arithmetical mean of
the retarded and the advanced solution.
Furthermore, this motivates why t+, t−, 1
2|t| are called retarded, advanced,
retarded-advanced fundamental solution of
d2
dt2 , respectively. The importance of
retarded-advanced fundamental solutions in quantum electrodynamics was empha-
sized by Wheeler and Feynman in 1945.33 The function
G+(t, τ) := (t −τ)+
for all
t, τ ∈R
is called the retarded Green’s function of the Newtonian equation m¨x = F (with
m := 1), and
G−(t, τ) := (t −τ)−
for all
t, τ ∈R
32 Choose m := 1.

is called the advanced Green’s function. Fix τ ∈R. Then, in the sense of tempered
distributions, for all t ∈R we get:
∂2
∂t2 G+(t, τ) = δ(t −τ),
∂2
∂t2 G−(t, τ) = δ(t −τ),
∂2
∂t2 G(t, τ) = δ(t −τ).
Furthermore, we have:
• G+(t, τ) = 0 for all t ≤τ.
• G−(t, τ) = 0 for all t ≥τ.
The retarded and advanced Green’s functions determine the Green’s function. Ex-
plicitly, for all t, τ ∈R,
G(t, τ) =
(
G+(t, τ)

τ ≥0,
G−(t, τ)
if
τ < 0.
The corresponding notions for the motion of a quantum particle on the real line
will be considered in Sect. 8.5 on page 729.
Fundamental Solutions in the Energy Space
Our next goal is to compute the fundamental solutions t+, t−and 1
2|t| by using the
Fourier transform.
The formal Fourier transform. The Fourier transform reads as34
ˆx(E) =

t ∈R.
Thus, the diﬀerentiation operator
d
dt is transformed into multiplication by the factor
−iE.
As in most textbooks in physics, we will start by using the Fourier transform in
a formal way. That is, we will use the usual rules for the classical Fourier transform
without worrying about the existence of the classical Fourier transform. However,
this will cause trouble. In a next step we will use the theory of tempered distribu-
tions in order to get the rigorous approach. This way we will understand why it is
important to consider retarded (resp. advanced) fundamental solutions.
(i) First method (formal fundamental solution): Applying the formal Fourier
transform to ¨x = F, we get −E2ˆx(E) = ˆF(E). Hence
ˆx(E) = −

for all
E ∈R.
If ˆF ∈S(R) and ˆF(E) = O(E2) as E →+0, then the tempered distribution

(ii) Second method (adiabatic regularization): Suppose that F(t) = 0 for all

The rigorous Laplace transform. Suppose that F ∈S(R) together with
F(t) = 0 for all t < 0. Let x = x(t) be the classical solution of (2.61) with the

polynomial growth. Therefore, the integral

and the solution of the initial-value problem (also called Cauchy problem) for wave

2.3 Further Regularization Methods in Mathematics
In physical experiments, physicists measure ﬁnite numbers. In contrast to this, the
theory frequently generates inﬁnite expressions.
The main task is to extract relevant ﬁnite information from inﬁnite ex-
pressions.
In the history of mathematics, mathematicians frequently encountered this prob-
lem.36 Let us discuss some important approaches.
2.3.1 Euler’s Philosophy
One of the greatest masters in mathematics, Leonhard Euler, relied on formal an-
alytic identities. He used the principle that the sum of a divergent series is the
value of the function from which the series is derived. For example, consider the
geometric series
1 + x + x2 + . . . =
1
1 −x.
(2.68)
According to Euler, we deﬁne
[1 + x + x2 + . . .]reg :=
1
1 −x
for all
x ∈C \ {1}.
We call this the regularized value of the series 1 + x + x2 + . . .37. We have the
following consistency theorem:
If the series (2.68) is convergent, then its sum coincides with the regularized
value.
However, this method is also able to assign ﬁnite values to a divergent series. For
example, if we choose x = −1 and x = 2, then
[1 −1 + 1 −1 + . . .]reg = 1
2,
and [1 + 2 + 22 + 23 + . . .]reg = −1. In the case where x = 1, this simple regu-
larization method fails. Then we have to use the more sophisticated zeta function
regularization discussed on page 55. By this method, we assign the value ζ(0) = −1
2
to the divergent series 1 + 1 + 1 + . . .
As a second example for Euler’s philosophy, consider the formal power series
expansion
f(x) = x −1!x2 + 2!x3 −3!x4 + . . . ,
(2.69)
36 For the history of this topic full of errors and pitfalls, we refer to M. Kline,
Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times, Vol. 3, Sect. 47, Oxford
University Press, 1972. We also refer to the following classic monographs:
G. Hardy, Divergent Series, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1949.
K. Knopp, Theory and Applications of Inﬁnite Series, Dover, New York, 1989.
37 In modern language, the power series expansion (2.68) converges for all complex
numbers x with |x| < 1. This yields the holomorphic function f(x) :=
1
1−x on
the open unit disc. Finally, the function x →
1
1−x on the pointed complex plane
C \ {1} is the analytic continuation of f.

94
2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
which is divergent for all nonzero complex numbers x. Formal diﬀerentiation yields
f ′(x) = 1 −2!x + 3!x2 −4!x3 + . . .
Hence
x2f ′(x) + f(x) = x,
f(0) = 0.
Surprisingly enough, this diﬀerential equation has the rigorous solution
f(x) = x
Z ∞
0
e−t
1 + xt dt
for all
x ≥0.
(2.70)
Note that this integral exists for all x ≥0. Therefore, Euler assigned the function
f to the divergent series (2.69). In particular, choosing x = 1, we get the ﬁnite
regularization
[2! −3! + 4! −. . .]reg :=
Z ∞
0
e−t
1 + t dt
of the divergent series 2! −3! + 4! −. . .
2.3.2 Adiabatic Regularization of Divergent Series
Suppose we are given the series
a0 + a1 + a2 + . . .
(2.71)
with complex coeﬃcients a0, a1, a2, . . . We assign the perturbed series
a0 + a1x + a2x2 + . . . ,
(2.72)
and we assume that there exists a number ε > 0 such that the perturbed series
(2.72) is convergent for all x ∈]1 −ε, 1[. Now we let the perturbation go to zero,
that is, x →1 −0. We deﬁne
" ∞

k=0
ak
#
reg

lim
x→1−0
∞
X
k=0
akxk
if the limit exists. Physicists call this adiabatic regularization. The idea is to perturb
a given physical system and to study the limit when the perturbation goes to zero.
Mathematicians call this Abel summation. For example,
1 −1 + 1 −. . . =
lim
x→1−0(1 −x + x2 −. . .) =
lim
x→1−0
1
1 + x = 1
2.
Abel proved the consistency of this method:
If the series P∞
k=0 ak is convergent, then its sum is equal to the adiabatic
regularization.

2.3.3 Adiabatic Regularization of Oscillating Integrals
Fix the large angular frequency ωmax and the large time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. Let us
consider the following three integrals:
(i) Almost white noise:
δωmax(t) := 1
2π
Z ωmax

eiωtdω
for all
times t ∈R.
(ii) White noise (Dirac’s delta function):
δ(t) := 1

for all

t ̸= 0,
ωmax ·

π
if
t = 0.
The function δωmax represents the superposition of harmonic waves with angular
frequencies ω ∈[−ωmax, ωmax], where each harmonic wave has the same amplitude.
Physicists and engineers call this an approximation of white noise. From the physical
point of view, it makes sense to consider the limit ωmax →+∞. If t = 0, then we
get
lim
ωmax→+∞δωmax(0) = +∞.
However, if t ̸= 0, then the limit limωmax→+∞δωmax(t) does not exist because of
strong oscillations. Therefore, it is necessary to regularize the situation. To this end,
ﬁx the regularization parameter ε > 0, and consider the following two integrals.
(a) Adiabatic Dirac delta function:
δε(t) := 1
2π
Z ∞

eiωte−εω2dω
for all

(b) Adiabatic time average of a harmonic oscillation:
mε(ω) :=

R ∞
−∞e−εt2dt
for all
ω ∈R.
In order to compute these integrals, we use the key formula
1
√
2π

eiωte−t2/2dt = e−ω2/2,
telling us that the Gaussian function t →e−t2/2 is invariant under the Fourier
transformation. By rescaling, this implies

δε(t) = e−t2/4ε

for all
t ∈R,
and
mε(ω) = e−ω2/4ε
for all

Letting ε →+0, we obtain the adiabatic limits

t = 0,
0
if
t ̸= 0,
and limε→+0 mε(ω) = m(ω) for all ω ∈R. Note the crucial fact that
Adiabatic averaging cancels inﬁnities.
This is the secret behind the incredible success of path integral methods in quantum
physics.
The Feynman approach to quantum ﬁeld theory via path integrals is based
on formal adiabatic averages.
The basic ideas are studied in Chap. 7 of Vol. I, in terms of a ﬁnite-dimensional
rigorous setting.
2.3.4 Regularization by Averaging
For a sequence (sn) of complex numbers, Cauchy proved that
lim
n→+∞
s0 + s1 + . . . + sn
n + 1
= lim
n→∞sn
if the right-hand limit exists. This method can be successively applied to the
sequence (sn) of partial sums of an inﬁnite series P∞
k=0 ak with complex terms
a0, a1, . . . Here, sn := a0 + a1 + . . . an. As usual, we deﬁne
∞

k=0
ak := lim
n→∞sn
if the right-hand limit exists. More generally, we deﬁne the averaged regularization
" ∞

#

s0 + s1 + . . . + sn

(2.73)
According to Cauchy, we have the following consistency theorem: If the series
P∞
k=0 ak is convergent, then its sum coincides with the regularization in the sense
of (2.73). This summation method and its iterations were studied by Otto H¨older
(1859–1937) in 1882. Mathematicians call this the H¨older summation. For example,
consider the formula
1
(1 + x)2 = 1 −2x + 3x2 −4x3 + . . . ,
which follows from −
1
1+x = −1 + x −x2 + . . . by formal diﬀerentiation. Setting
x = 1, Euler assigned the value 1
4 to the divergent series 1 −2 + 3 −4 + . . . . The
H¨older summation of 1 −2 + 3 −4 + . . . proceeds as follows. The partial sums are

2.3 Further Regularization Methods in Mathematics
97
s0 = 1, s1 = −1, s2 = 2, s3 = −2, . . .
For the averaged partial sums s(1)
n

1
n+1(s0 + ... + sn), we get
s(1)
0
= 1, s(1)
1
= 0, s(1)
2

3, s(1)

= 0, . . .
The sequence (s(1)
n ) is not convergent. Averaging this sequence again, we get
s(2)

12, . . .
It can be shown that the sequence (s(2)
n ) converges to 1
4, which coincides with the
Euler sum of the divergent series 1 −2 + 3 −4 + . . .
The reconstruction theorem for the Fourier series. In the 19th century,
mathematicians discovered that the convergence problem for the Fourier series is
highly sophisticated. This strongly inﬂuenced the development of analysis and func-
tional analysis in the 20th century. Let us describe the basic ideas.38 Suppose we
are given the 2π-periodic continuous function f : R →C. We want to approximate
the function f by the simpler 2π-periodic functions x →einx with n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Motivated by Gauss’ method of least squares, we consider the following minimum
problem
Z π
−π
˛˛f(x) −

aneinx˛˛2dx = min!
for the unknown complex coeﬃcients a0, a1, a−1, a2, a−2, . . . This problem has the
unique solution
an := 1
2π
Z π
−π
f(x)e−inxdx,
n = −N, −N + 1, . . . , N
for N = 0, 1, 2, . . . The complex numbers an are called the Fourier coeﬃcients of
the function f. Since the function f is continuous, we expect that the Fourier series
f(x) =
∞
X
n=−∞
aneinx
(2.74)
is convergent for all x ∈R. Unfortunately, this is not true, as was shown by Du
Bois-Reymond in 1871. There arises the following question: How can we extract
the information about the function f from the knowledge of its Fourier coeﬃcients?
There are two answers.
(i) Mean square convergence:
lim
N→∞
Z π
−π
|f(x) −

aneinx|2dx = 0.
(ii) Averaging (Fej´er 1904):

reg,average = f(x) for all x ∈R.
38 The proofs can be found in Zeidler (1995a), quoted on page 1049.

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
More generally, the mean square convergence (i) is true for all measurable func-
tions f :] −π, π[→C with
R π
−π |f(x)|2dx < ∞because of the fact that the
family {einx/
√

L2(−π, π).
Tauberian theorems. Let us consider an arbitrary series P∞
n=0 an with com-
plex terms a0, a1, a2, . . . Then the following implications hold:
classical convergence ⇒regularization by averaging ⇒adiabatic regular-
ization.
In particular, this tells us that if the series can be regularized by averaging, then
it can also be regularized in the adiabatic sense, and the regularized values are the
same. Conversely, we have the following convergence theorem:
The series P∞
n=0 an is convergent if the series can be regularized in the
adiabatic sense (or by averaging in the sense of (2.73)) and we have the
relation |an| = O( 1
n) as n →+∞.
This was proved by Hardy and Littlewood in the 1910s by generalizing a weaker
theorem proved by Tauber in 1890.39 Combining the Tauberian theorem above with
the Fej´er theorem, we get the following basic theorem:
If the 2π-periodic function f : R →C is continuous and its Fourier co-
eﬃcients satisfy the condition |an| = O( 1
n) as n →∞, then the Fourier
series converges to f on the real line.
2.3.5 Borel Regularization
In 1899 Borel investigated the following summation method.40 Deﬁne

if the series P∞

an
n! tn converges for all real numbers t and the integral exists. In
this case, we say that the series P∞
n=0 an is Borel regularizable (or Borel summable).
We have the following consistency theorem:
If the series P∞
n=0 an is convergent, then it is Borel regularizable and its
sum coincides with the regularized value.
For example, let −∞< ℜ(z) < 1. Set z := x + yi with x, y ∈R. Then
[1 + z + z2 + . . .]reg,Borel =

This shows that Borel summability is able to construct analytic continuation. For
example, we have the following theorem:
39 Numerous theorems of this type can be found in the monograph by J. Korevaar,
Tauberian Theory: A Century of Developments, Springer, Berlin, 2004. In Sect.
6.5.1 of Vol. I, we have used a Tauberian theorem for the Laplace transformation
in order to give an elegant proof of the prime number theorem.

If the power series expansion f(z) := P∞
n=0 anzn has a ﬁnite positive
radius of convergence and is Borel summable at the nonzero point z = 2z0,
then the function f has an analytic continuation to the open disc of radius
|z0| centered at the point z0.
This represents Borel’s circle method of analytic continuation. As another impor-
tant example, let us mention the Nevalinna–Sokal theorem:41 We are given the
positive numbers R and r. Let UR(R) denote the open disc of radius R centered at
the point R of the complex plane.
Suppose that the function f : UR(R) →C is holomorphic with the expan-
sion f(z) = Pn−1

Poincar´e’s asymptotic series. We now want to study a class of divergent
series which is very useful for computing problems in mathematics and physics. Let
x > 0, and let a0, a1, . . . be complex numbers. We write
f(x) ∼a0 + a1
x + a2
x2 + . . . ,
x →+∞
(2.76)
iﬀthe remainder |f(x) −(a0 + a1
x + . . . + an
xn )| has the order of magnitude o( 1
xn )
as x →+∞for all indices n = 0, 1, 2, . . . In this case, we say that the function f
has the asymptotic series expansion a0 + a1
x + a2
x2 + . . . as x →+∞. This notion
was used by Poincar´e in order to study the solutions of linear singular ordinary
diﬀerential equations of Fuchsian type and the perturbed motion of planets in
celestial mechanics.43
Let us study a simple example. Consider the integral
f(x) :=
Z ∞
x

dt,
x > 0.
We are interested in the behavior of this integral for large values of x. Repeated
integration by parts yields

Phys. 21(2) (1980), 261–263.
42 In addition, we obtain that the function F is holomorphic on the open circle
Ur(0) (of radius r centered at the origin) and has an analytic continuation to the
open neighborhood {t ∈C : dist(t, R+) < r} of the positive real axis.

iﬀthe remainder |f(x) −(a0 + a1(x −a) + . . . + an(x −a)n)| has the order of

order to study combinatorial problems in the theory of probability.

2.3.7 Inﬁnite-Dimensional Gaussian Integrals and the Zeta

We want to show that the passage from a ﬁnite to an inﬁnite number of degrees of
freedom may cause mathematical trouble. As a model, let us consider the Gaussian
integral and its inﬁnite-dimensional limit which is called a functional integral (or
Feynman path integral). Let {λk} be a sequence of positive numbers with 0 < λ1 ≤
λ2 ≤λ3 ≤. . . , and let {Jk} be a sequence of real numbers. Let us choose the

is meaningless near s = 0, in the usual sense. However, there exists an analytical

and we will use this extension. In this sense, we have46

In the mathematics and physics literature, one frequently encounters the inter-

crucial fact that the formal interchange of limits can lead to wrong results.

2.4.2 The Ambiguity of Regularization Methods

results. As a simple example, consider the Euler series 1 −1 + 1 −. . . . The two
functions
f1(x) :=

represent adiabatic regularization of the divergent series 1 −1 + 1 −. . . As usual,
deﬁne
[1 −1 + 1 −1 + . . .]j,reg := fj(1),
j = 1, 2.
Then we get the diﬀerent values f1(1) = 1

2.4.3 Pseudo-Convergence
In quantum ﬁeld theory, physicists use the method of perturbation theory in order
to compute physical quantities (e.g., the cross section of a scattering process) as
formal power series expansions of the type
σ(κ) = a0 + a1κ + a2κ2 + . . . ,
κ > 0
(2.83)
where the positive parameter κ represents the so-called coupling constant, which
measures the strength of interaction. There arises the following question:
What can we say about the mathematical meaning of (2.83). Is this more
than a formal power series expansion?
In 1951 Dyson invented a heuristic physical argument in order to rule out the
convergence of (2.83) in a neighborhood of the point κ = 0. Roughly speaking,
he argued as follows: If the power series expansion (2.83) has a positive radius of
convergence around the origin, then it also converges for small negative values of
the coupling constant κ. However, such a negative coupling constant corresponds
to repelling forces which destroy the physical system.
An example of pseudo-convergence. Suppose that the methods of formal
perturbation theory produce the following quantity
σ(κ) = 1 + κ + κ2
2! + . . . + κ6
6! + κ7 −1!κ8 + 2!κ9 −3!κ10 + . . . ,
κ > 0.
If we compute the function f up to order six, then we get
σ(κ) = 1 + κ + κ2
2! + . . . + κ6
6! .
However, if we compute higher-order terms, then we encounter the divergent series
κ7 −1!κ8 + 2!κ9 −3!κ10 + . . . We call this pseudo-convergence. According to (2.70)
on page 94, a possible regularization reads as
freg(κ) := 1 + κ + κ2
2! + . . . κ6
6! + κ7
Z ∞

The comparison with the results of physical experiments decides whether this reg-

Asymptotic series and the Ritt theorem. An interesting mathematical
result tells us that each formal power series expansion is the asymptotic series of
a function f with respect to small positive values. Moreover, the function f is
analytic on an appropriate open neighborhood of the positive real line, where the
neighborhood has the shape of an angular sector. The precise result reads as follows.
We are given the formal power series expansion
a0 + a1κ + a2κ2 + . . .
with complex coeﬃcients a0, a1, a2, . . . We choose the angular sector
S := {z ∈C : z = reiϕ, −γ < ϕ < γ, r > 0}
where γ is an arbitrary, but ﬁxed number in the open interval ]0, π
2 [.
Then there exists an analytic function σ : S →C such that
σ(κ) ∼a0 + a1κ + a2κ2 + . . . as κ →0 on S.
Explicitly, this means that for each index n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , we have
σ(κ) = a0 + a1κ + a2κ2 + . . . + anκn + Rn(κ)
where the remainder Rn has the property κnRn(κ) →0 as κ →0 on S.
The Borel theorem. Suppose that we are given the formal power series ex-
pansion
a0 + a1κ + a2κ2 + . . .
with real coeﬃcients a0, a1, a2, . . . . Let r > 0.
Then there exists a smooth function σ :] −r, r[→R such that
dnσ
dκn (0) = an
for all
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
In addition, the function σ is real-analytic.47 on the pointed interval ] −
r, r] \ {0}.
The proof of the Borel theorem based on the proof of the Ritt theorem can be found
in R. Remmert, Theory of Complex Functions, p. 300, Springer, New York, 1991.
2.4.4 Ill-Posed Problems
Distinguish carefully between well-posed and ill-posed problems.
Folklore
By using the simple example (2.88) below, we want to show that an uncritical use
of the method of perturbation theory may lead to wrong results if the problem
is ill-posed. This is a possible paradigm for quantum ﬁeld theory. According to
Hadamard (1865–1863), a mathematical problem is called well-posed iﬀit has a
unique solution which depends continuously on the data of the problem. Otherwise,
the problem is called ill-posed.
Roughly speaking, ill-posed problems refer to incomplete information.
47 This means that the function σ can be represented as a local power series ex-
pansion in a suﬃciently small neighborhood of each nonzero point in the interval
] −r, r[.

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
For example, if we measure the gravitational ﬁeld of earth by satellites, then the
determination of the mass distribution of the earth by the measured data repre-
sents an ill-posed problem. Other important applications are computer tomography
and inverse scattering problems in quantum mechanics (the determination of the
potential by using scattering data).48 As a prototype, let us consider the minimum
problem
||A(α)ψ −f||2 = min!,
ψ ∈X
(2.84)
which is motivated by the Gaussian method of least squares. Here, for any α ∈]0, 1[,
the operator A(α) : X →X is linear on the real Hilbert space X of ﬁnite dimension
m = 1, 2, . . . For ﬁxed parameter α ∈]0, 1[, we are given f ∈X. We are looking for
ψ ∈X.
Well-posed problem. Let L(X, X) denote the space of linear operators B :
X →X equipped with the operator norm ||B|| := max||ψ||≤1 ||Bψ||.
Proposition 2.14 Suppose that the inverse operator A(α)−1 : X →X exists for
each parameter α ∈]0, 1[, and α →A(α) is a continuous map from ]0, 1[ into
L(X, X).49 Then the minimum problem (2.84) is well-posed. For each parameter
α ∈]0, 1[, the unique solution is given by ψ(α) = A(α)−1f.
Proof. (I) Existence. Note that ||A(α)ψ −f||2 ≥0 for all ψ ∈X, and we have
||A(α)ψ(α) −f||2 = 0.
(II) Uniqueness. ||A(α)ψ −f||2 = 0 implies A(α)ψ −f = 0, and hence ψ =
A(α)−1f.
(III) Continuity. The continuity of the map α →A(α) from ]0, 1[ into L(X, X)
implies the continuity of the map α →A−1(α) from ]0, 1[ into L(X, X) (see Zeidler
(1995), Vol. 1, Sect. 1.23). Therefore, αn →α and fn →f on X as n →∞imply
A(αn)−1fn →A(α)−1f on X as n →∞, for the corresponding solutions.
2
The generalized inverse operator. Let A : X →X be a linear operator on
the real Hilbert space X. The trick is to introduce the operator
C := A†A.
Because of C† = A†(A†)† = C, the operator C is self-adjoint. Therefore, it possesses
a complete orthonormal system ψ1, . . . ψm of eigenvectors with the eigenvalues
μ1, . . . , μm. Obviously, μk = ⟨ψk|Cψk⟩= ⟨Aψk|Aψk⟩≥0. The values σk := √μk
are called the singular values of the operator A.50 Let us choose the indices in such
a way that σj > 0 if j = 1, . . . , r, and σj = 0 if j = r + 1, . . . , m. We will prove in
Problem 2.5 that
Aψ =
r
X
j=1
σj|ϕj⟩⟨ψj|
for all
ψ ∈X
(2.85)
where ϕj := σ−1
j Aψj. In particular, we will show that ψ1, . . . , ψr (resp. ϕ1, . . . , ϕr)
is an orthonormal basis of ker(A)⊥(resp. im(A)). The operator
48 We refer to the textbook by G. Ramm, Inverse Problems: Mathematical and
Analytical Techniques in Engineering, Springer, New York, 2005.
49 This is equivalent to the continuity of the matrix elements of A(α) with respect
to a ﬁxed basis.
50 If the operator A is self-adjoint with the eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λm, then σk = |λk|
for all k.

2.4 Trouble in Mathematics
107
Ainv :=
r
X
j=1
σ−1
j |ψj⟩⟨ϕj|
(2.86)
is called the generalized inverse (or the Moore–Penrose inverse) of the operator A.
This generalized inverse plays a crucial role in the theory of ill-posed problems.
Consider again the minimum problem (2.84) for the ﬁxed parameter α ∈]0, 1[. To
simplify notation, set A := A(α).
Proposition 2.15 The general solution of the minimum problem (2.84) is given
by the sum ψ = Ainvf + ϕ where ϕ is an arbitrary solution of the equation Aϕ = 0.
The proof will be given in Problem 2.7. This proof shows that Ainvf is the unique
solution of the modiﬁed minimum problem
||Aψ −f||2 = min!,
ψ ∈ker(A)⊥
where the symbol ker(A)⊥denotes the orthogonal complement to the null space
ker(A) := {ψ ∈X : Aψ = 0} of the operator A. Since we have the orthogonality
relation ||Ainvf + ϕ||2 = ||Ainvf||2 + ||ϕ||2 for all ϕ ∈ker(A), the element Ainvf is
a solution of the problem
||Aψ −f||2 = min!,
ψ ∈X
which has the smallest norm among all the solutions. This solution is uniquely
determined.
Note the following. Proposition 2.15 shows that the original minimum problem
(2.84) has a unique solution iﬀker(A) = 0, that is, the operator is invertible. In
this case, we have A−1 = Ainv; this means that the inverse operator coincides with
the generalized inverse operator.
The Tikhonov regularization. Let us replace the original problem (2.84) by
the regularized problem
||Aψ −f||2 + ε||ψ||2 = min!,
ψ ∈X.
(2.87)
Let us introduce the so-called ﬁlter function Fε(σ) :=
σ2
σ2+ε.
Proposition 2.16 For each parameter ε > 0, the regularized problem (2.87) has
the unique solution
ψ(ε) :=
r
X
j=1
Fε(σj) · σ−1
j ⟨ϕj|f⟩ψj.
Since Fε(σj) →1 as ε →+0, the solution ψ(ε) goes to Ainvf as ε →+0.
Recall that Ainvf is a distinguished solution of the minimum problem (2.87) with
ε = 0. The proof of Prop. 2.16 can be found in Problem 2.8. Fix ε > 0. For the
ﬁlter function, we get
lim
σ→+0 Fε(σ) = 0,
lim
σ→∞Fε(σ) = 1.
Therefore, the approximation of Ainvf by ψ(ε) critically depends on the behavior of
f and on the magnitude of the singular values σ1, . . . , σr. For example, let f = ϕ1.
Noting that ϕ1, . . . , ϕn forms an orthonormal system, we get

108
2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
ψ(ε) = Fε(σ1) · σ−1
1 ψ1 = Fε(σ1)Ainvf.
If σ1 ≫ε, then Fε(σ1) ∼1, and hence ψ(ε) ∼Ainvf. In contrast to this, if σ ≪ε,
then Fε(σ1) ∼0, and ψ(ε) strongly diﬀers from Ainvf. The method of regularization
plays a fundamental role in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Special ill-posed problem. We want to study the problem (2.84) in the
special case where
A(α) :=
 
b(α) 0
0
1
!
,
b(α) := η(1 + α + α2 + . . . + α100) −α101.
Let 0 < α, η < 1. Explicitly, the original problem (2.84) reads as
(b(α)ψ1 −f1)2 + (ψ2 −f2)2 = min!.
(2.88)
If b(α) ̸= 0, then this problem has the unique solution
ψ1 =
f1
b(α),
ψ2 = f2.
However, if b(α) = 0, then (2.84) has the general solution
ψ1 = arbitrary real number,
ψ2 = f2.
In this case, the problem is ill-posed.
The pitfalls of formal perturbation theory. Let n = 1, 2, . . . , 100. Use the
nth order approximation bn(α) := η(1 + α + . . . + αn) of b(α), and replace the
original problem (2.88) by the approximate problem
(bn(α)ψ1 −f1)2 + (ψ2 −f2)2 = min!.
This problem has the unique solution
ψ1 =
f1
bn(α) =
(1 −α)f1
η(1 −αn+1) = f1
η (1 −α)(1 + αn+1 + . . .),
and ψ2 = f2. If we only consider terms up to order n, then the solution reads as
ψ1 = f1
η (1 −α),
ψ2 = f2.
(2.89)
Now consider the nth order case where n = 101. By Problem 2.9, there exists a
number η0 > 0 such that the nonlinear equation b101(α) = 0, that is,
α = η1/101(1 + α + . . . + α100)1/101,
α ∈[0, 1]
has a unique solution α(η) for each parameter η ∈]0, η0[. If we choose the critical
parameter α = α(η), then the original problem (2.88) has the general solution ψ1=
arbitrary real number, ψ2 = f2. This solution diﬀers drastically from (2.89).
This means that, in the present example, a catastrophe occurs in very high
order of formal perturbation theory.
Therefore, if we use perturbation theory in a formal manner, we can never exclude
such a singular behavior. This tells us that

The results obtained by formal perturbation theory have to be handled cau-
tiously.
Formal perturbation theory and quantum ﬁeld theory. Until now, all of
the predictions made by quantum ﬁeld theory are based on the method of formal
perturbation theory. Surprisingly, for small coupling constants in quantum electro-
dynamics and electroweak interaction, the theoretical predictions coincide with the
experimental results with very high accuracy. Physicists belief that this cannot hap-
pen by chance. There remains the task to create a mathematically rigorous theory
which explains the great success of formal perturbation theory.

Euler truly did not sour his life with limiting value considerations, con-
vergence and continuity criteria and he could not and did not wish to
bother about the logical foundation of analysis, but rather he relied – only

but three have appeared as of today.52 Euler’s correspondence with nearly
300 colleagues is estimated to constitute 4500 to 5000 letters, of which
perhaps a third appear to have been lost. These letters are to appear in
13 Volumes.
Euler was not only one of the greatest mathematicians, but also in general
one of the most creative human beings.
R¨udiger Thiele, 1982
In the entire history of mathematics, aside from the golden age of Greek
mathematics, there has never been a better time than that of Leonhard
Euler. It was his privilege to leave mathematics with a completely changed
face, making it into a powerful machine that it is today.53

2. Basic Strategy of Extracting Information from Inﬁnities
The implicit philosophical belief of the working mathematician is today the
Hilbert–Bourbaki formalism. Ideally, one works within a closed system: the
basic principles are clearly enunciated once for all, including (that is an
addition of twentieth century science) the formal rules of logical reasoning
clothed in mathematical form. The basic principles include precise deﬁni-
tions of all mathematical objects, and the coherence between the various
branches of mathematical sciences is achieved through reduction to basic
models in the universe of sets. A very important feature of the system is its
non-contradiction; after G¨odel (1906–1978), we have lost the initial hopes
to establish the non-contradiction by a formal reasoning, but one can live
with a corresponding belief in non-contradiction. The whole structure is
certainly very appealing, but the illusion is that it is eternal, that it will
function for ever according to the same principles. What history of math-
ematics teaches us is that the principles of mathematical deduction, and
not simply the mathematical theories, have evolved over the centuries. In
modern times, theories like General Topology or Lebesgue’s Integration
Theory represent an almost perfect model of precision, ﬂexibility, and har-
mony, and their applications, for instance to probability theory, have been
very successful. My thesis is:
There is another way of doing mathematics, equally successful, and the two
methods should supplement each other and not ﬁght.
This other way bears various names: symbolic method, operational cal-
culus, operator theory. . . Euler was the ﬁrst to use such methods in his
extensive study of inﬁnite series, convergent as well as divergent. The cal-
culus of diﬀerences was developed by Boole (1815–1864) around 1860 in a
symbolic way, then Heaviside (1850–1925) created his own symbolic cal-
culus to deal with systems of diﬀerential equations in electric circuits. But
the modern master was Feynman (1918–1988) who used his diagrams, his
disentangling of operators, his path integrals. . .
The method consists in stretching the formulas to their extreme
consequences, resorting to some internal feeling of coherence and
harmony.
There are obviously pitfalls in such methods, and only experience can tell
you that for the Dirac delta function an expression like xδ(x) or δ′(x) is
lawful, but not δ(x)/x or δ(x)2. Very often, these so-called symbolic meth-
ods have been substantiated by later rigorous developments, for instance,
the Schwartz distribution theory gives a rigorous meaning to δ(x), but
physicists used sophisticated formulas in “momentum space” long before
Laurent Schwartz codiﬁed the Fourier transformation for distributions.
The Feynman “sums over histories” have been immensely successful in
many problems, coming from physics as well from mathematics, despite
the lack of a comprehensive rigorous theory.
Newton (1643–1727), Leibniz (1646–1716), Euler (1707–1783) and their successors
very successfully used inﬁnitesimals, that is, quantities with the strange property
dx ̸= 0
and
(dx)2 = 0.
(2.90)
Such quantities are still frequently used in the physics literature. Obviously, classi-
cal numbers dx do not have the property (2.90). Based on the notion of ultra-ﬁlters,
we will show in Sect. 4.6 how to introduce rigorously such inﬁnitesimals as equiv-
alence classes of real numbers. We will embed this into the discussion of a general
mathematical strategy called the strategy of equivalence classes.

k⟨ϕ|ψk⟩= 0
for all
ϕ ∈X.
Therefore, Aψk is perpendicular to the image im(A). Hence Aψk = 0. By (2.91),
A = Pr
j=1 A|ψj⟩⟨ψj|. Finally, Aψj = σjϕj. In addition, as preparation for an

⟨ϕj|ϕk⟩= σ−2
j ⟨Aψj|Aψk⟩= σ−2
j ⟨ψj|A†Aψk⟩= ⟨ψj|ψk⟩= δjk,
j, k = 1, . . . , r.
Therefore, ϕ1, . . . , ϕr is an orthonormal basis of the linear space im(A), and
ψ1, . . . , ψr is an orthonormal basis of the linear space ker(A)⊥.

2. Extracting Finite Information From Inﬁnities
2.6 Quadratic variational problem. Let B : X →X be a linear self-adjoint operator
on the real ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space X. Suppose that there is a number

the minimum problem

2⟨ψ|Bψ⟩−⟨f|ψ⟩= min!,
ψ ∈X
has the unique solution ψ = B−1f. (In particular, the inverse operator B−1
exists on X.) Hint: See Zeidler (1995), Vol. 2, Sect. 2.4.
2.7 Proof of Proposition 2.15 on page 107. Solution: The minimum problem
||f −f0||2 = min!,
f0 ∈im(A)
has a unique solution, by Problem 2.6. Geometrically, f0 is the orthogonal
projection of f onto the linear space im(A). The equation
Aψ = f0,
ψ ∈ker(A)⊥
has a unique solution ψ0. Since Aψ −f ∈im(A) and f −f0 ∈im(A)⊥, the
orthogonal decomposition of Aψ −f into the sum (Aψ −f0) + (f0 −f) yields
||Aψ −f||2 = ||Aψ −f0||2 + ||f0 −f||2.
Therefore, the original problem ||Aψ −f||2 = min!, ψ ∈X is equivalent to the
minimum problem
||Aψ −f0||2 = min!,
ψ ∈X
which has the general solution ψ = ψ0 + ϕ with an arbitrary element ϕ in
ker(A). By Problem 2.5, ϕ1, . . . , ϕr is an orthonormal basis of im(A), and

3. The Power of Combinatorics
Hopf algebra is invading quantum ﬁeld theory from both ends, both at
the foundational level and the computational level. . . The approach from
quantum theoretical ﬁrst principle is still in its ﬁrst infancy.1
H´ector Figueroa and Jos´e Gracia-Bondia, 2005
In this series of monographs, we will show that:
There are highly complex mathematical structures behind the idea of the
renormalization of quantum ﬁeld theories.
The combinatorial structure of Feynman diagrams lies at the heart of renormaliza-
tion methods. In the standard Boguliubov–Parasiuk–Hepp–Zimmermann (BPHZ)
approach, the regularization of algebraic Feynman integrals is carried out by an
iterative method which was invented by Bogoliubov in the 1950s. It was shown by
Zimmermann in 1969 that Bogoliubov’s iterative method can be solved in a closed
form called the Zimmermann forest formula. Finally, it was discovered by Kreimer
in 1998 that Zimmermann’s forest formula can be formulated by using the coin-
verse of an appropriate Hopf algebra for Feynman graphs. This will be thoroughly
studied later on. In this chapter, we only want to discuss some basic ideas about
Hopf algebras and Rota–Baxter algebras.
3.1 Algebras
Products play a fundamental role in quantum ﬁeld theory (e.g., normal
products, time-ordered products, retarded products). They are used in
order to construct correlation functions.
Folklore
Algebras are linear spaces equipped with a distributive multiplication. Let us discuss
this.
The algebra of smooth functions as a prototype. Fix n = 1, 2, . . . Recall
that E(RN) denotes the set of all smooth complex-valued functions f : RN →C.
We write A instead of E(RN). For all functions f, g ∈A and all complex numbers
α, β, we deﬁne the linear combination αf + βg and the product fg by setting for
all x ∈RN:
• (αf + βg)(x) := αf(x) + βg(x),
• (fg)(x) := f(x)g(x).

3. The Power of Combinatorics
In addition, we deﬁne the so-called unit element 1 by setting
• 1(x) := 1 for all x ∈RN.
Then for all f, g, h ∈A and all α, β ∈C, the following hold:
(A1) Linearity: The set A is a complex linear space.
(A2) Consistency: fg ∈A, and (αf)g = f(αg) = α(fg).
(A3) Distributivity: (αf + βg)h = αfh + βfh, and
h(αf + βg) = αhf + βhg.
(A4) Associativity: (fg)h = f(gh).
(A5) Commutativity: fg = gf.
(A6) Unitality: There exists precisely one element 1 in A such that
1f = f1 = f
for all
f ∈A.
Here, 1 is called the unit element of A.
The deﬁnition of an algebra. As we will show later on, algebras play a fun-
damental role in the mathematical description of quantum processes. By deﬁnition,
the set A is called a complex algebra iﬀfor all f, g ∈A and all complex numbers
α and β, the linear combination αf + βg and the product fg are deﬁned in such a
way that the conditions (A1), (A2), and (A3) are always satisﬁed.2 In addition, we
use the following terminology.
• The algebra A is called associative iﬀcondition (A4) is always satisﬁed.
• The algebra A is called commutative iﬀcondition (A5) is always satisﬁed.
• The algebra A is called unital iﬀcondition (A6) is satisﬁed.
For example, the space D(RN) of smooth test functions f : RN →C with compact
support is a complex algebra. This algebra is associative and commutative. The
same is true for the spaces E(RN) and S(RN) of test functions.3 In addition, the
space E(RN) is unital.
For ﬁxed n = 2, 3, . . . , the set of complex (n × n)-matrices forms a complex
algebra which is associative, noncommutative, and unital. Here, the unit element
is given by the unit matrix I := diag(1, 1, . . . , 1).
A subset B of a complex algebra A is called a subalgebra iﬀit is an algebra
with respect to the operations induced by A. Explicitly, this means that if f, g ∈B
and α, β ∈C, then αf + βg ∈B and fg ∈B.
Algebra morphism. Let A and B be algebras over C. The map
χ : A →B
is called an algebra morphism iﬀit respects linear combinations and products, that
is, the map χ is linear and we have χ(fg) = χ(f)χ(g) for all f, g ∈A. Bijective
algebra morphisms are also called algebra isomorphisms.
The map S : A →B is called an algebra anti-morphism iﬀit is linear and we
have S(fg) = S(g)S(f) for all f, g ∈A.
Modiﬁcation. Real algebras (also called algebras over R) are deﬁned anal-
ogously. We only replace the ﬁeld C of complex numbers by the ﬁeld R of real
numbers.
Perspectives. In this series of monographs, algebras will be encountered quite
often. Let us mention the following examples:
2 Analogously, the deﬁnition of a real algebra is obtained by starting from a real
linear space A and by replacing complex numbers by real numbers.
3 The precise deﬁnition of the space S(RN) of smooth, rapidly decreasing functions
f : RN →C can be found in Sect. 10.3.3 of Vol. I.

Roughly speaking, products and hence algebras are everywhere.
3.2 The Algebra of Multilinear Functionals
Multilinear algebra studies all kinds of products.
Folklore
In what follows we want to study the elements of multilinear algebra, which play
a crucial role in modern physics. The main tool are multilinear functionals. The
tensor product ⊗and the Grassmann product ∧correspond to special multilinear
functionals which are called decomposable. A special role is played by symmetric
and antisymmetric multilinear functionals, which is related to bosons and fermions
in elementary particle physics, respectively.
In this section, the symbols X, Y, Z, Xα denote linear spaces over K. Here, we
choose K = R and K = C; this corresponds to real and complex linear spaces,
respectively. The index α runs in the nonempty index set A. For the basic deﬁnitions
concerning linear spaces, we refer to Sect. 7.3 of Vol. I. Recall that:
Two ﬁnite-dimensional real (resp. complex) linear spaces are linear iso-
morphic iﬀthey have the same dimension.

118
3. The Power of Combinatorics
This well-known theorem from the basic course in linear algebra essentially simpli-
ﬁes the theory of ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces. It shows that a ﬁnite-dimensional
linear space can be described by a single invariant, namely, its dimension. Note
that an analogous theorem for inﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces is not true. If
b1, b2, . . . , bn (resp. c1, . . . , cn) is a basis of the linear space X (resp. Y ), then the
map χ : X →Y given by
χ
 n
X
k=1
αkbk
!
:=
n
X
k=1
αkck
for all
α1, . . . , αn ∈K
is a linear isomorphism. Furthermore, each isomorphism between n-dimensional
linear spaces can be obtained this way.
The Cartesian product. By deﬁnition, the product set X × Y is given by
X × Y := {(x, y) : x ∈X, y ∈Y }.
If A : X →X and B : Y →Y are linear operators, then the linear product operator
A × B : X × Y →X × Y is deﬁned by
(A × B)(x, y) := (Ax, By)
for all
x ∈X, y ∈Y.
If A is a nonempty set, then the product Q
α∈A Xα is deﬁned to be the set of all
tuples
(xα)α∈A
where xα ∈Xα for all α ∈A.
Explicitly, the symbol (xα) stands for a map α →xα from A into the union
S
α∈A Xα with xα ∈Xα for all α ∈Xα.4
The direct sum X ⊕Y . The Cartesian product X ×Y becomes a linear space
over K if we introduce the linear combination
λ(x, y) + μ(u, v) := (λx + μu, λy + μv),
x, u ∈X, y, v ∈Y, λ, μ ∈K.
This linear space is denoted by X ⊕Y . If A : X →X and B : Y →Y are linear
operators, then the linear operator A ⊕B : X ⊕Y →X ⊕Y is deﬁned by
(A ⊕B)(x, y) := (Ax, By)
for all
x ∈X, y ∈Y.
The product Q
α∈A Xα becomes a linear space over K if we introduce the linear
combinations
λ(uα) + μ(vα) := (λuα + μvα)
for all (uα), (vα) ∈Q
α∈A Xα and all λ, μ ∈K. By deﬁnition, the direct sum
M
α∈A
Xα
is a linear subspace of the product space Q
α∈A Xα which consists precisely of all
the tuples (xα) with xα ̸= 0 for at most a ﬁnite set of indices α.5
The coproduct X ‘ Y. We deﬁne
X
a
Y := {(1, x) : x ∈X} ∪{(2, y) : y ∈Y }.
4 If one wants to be sure that the Cartesian product Πα∈A is not empty for inﬁnite
index sets A of arbitrary cardinality, then one needs Zermelo’s axiom of choice
(see page 246).
5 If the index set A is ﬁnite, then Q
α∈A Xα and L
α∈A Xα coincide.

3.2 The Algebra of Multilinear Functionals
119
If the spaces X and Y are disjoint, then we have X ‘ Y ≃X ∪Y, in the sense of a
bijection. Therefore, the coproduct is also called the disjoint union of X and Y . If
A is an index set, then we deﬁne
a
α∈A
Xα := {(α, xα) : α ∈A, xα ∈Xα}.
The space L(X, Y ) of linear operators. The set of all linear operators
A : X →Y forms a linear space over K which is denoted by L(X, Y ). In par-
ticular, the space L(X, X) forms a complex algebra with respect to the usual linear
combinations
αA + βB
of linear operators A, B : X →X where α, β ∈K. Furthermore, if X = Y , then
L(X, X) becomes an algebra over K with respect to the operator product AB.
The dual space Xd. Duality plays a fundamental role in quantum physics in
order to describe quantum ﬁelds (e.g., in perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory). The
dual space Xd to the given linear space X is deﬁned by
Xd := L(X, K).
This is a linear space over K. Let A : X →Y be a linear operator. Then the dual
operator Ad : Y d →Xd is deﬁned by
(Adf)(x) := f(Adx)
for all
x ∈X.
This refers to all linear functionals f ∈Y d.
Cobasis. Let b1, . . . , bn be linearly independent elements of the linear space X.
Deﬁne
bk

!
:= αk
for all
α1, . . . , αn ∈K, k = 1, . . . , n.
In particular, bk(bl) = δk
l for k, l = 1, . . . , n. We call b1, . . . , bn the dual system to
b1, . . . , bn.
Proposition 3.1 The functionals b1, . . . , bn are linearly independent elements of
the dual space Xd.
Proof. Let Pn
k=1 βkbk = 0 Applying this to bl, we get Pn
k=1 βkδk
l = 0. Hence
βl = 0 for l = 1, . . . , n.
2
If b1, . . . , bn is a basis of the linear space X, then b1, . . . , bn is a basis of the dual
space Xd called the cobasis of X. Consequently, if X is a ﬁnite-dimensional linear
space, then we have the linear isomorphism
X ≃Xd.
Setting Xdd := (Xd)d, we get the linear isomorphism Xdd ≃X. In diﬀerential
geometry, one writes dxk instead of bk.
For an arbitrary linear space X, we have
X ⊆Xdd
where X is a linear subspace of Xdd. This is to be understood in the following
sense. For ﬁxed x ∈X, deﬁne
Fx(f) := f(x)
for all
f ∈Xd.
The map Fx : Xd →K is linear. Hence Fx ∈Xdd.

120
3. The Power of Combinatorics
Proposition 3.2 The map x →Fx is a linear injective morphism from X to Xdd.
Therefore, the linear space X can be identiﬁed with a linear subspace of Xdd.
The proof will be given in Problem 4.11 on page 259 based on Zorn’s lemma.
The linear space M2(X, Y ) of bilinear functionals. Let the symbol
M2(X, Y ; K) denote the space of all bilinear functionals
B : X × Y →K.
Let B, C ∈M2(X, Y ; K) and β, γ ∈K. We deﬁne βB + γC by setting
(βB + γC)(x, y) := βB(x, y) + γC(x, y)
for all
x ∈X, y ∈Y.
This way, M2(X, Y ; K) becomes a linear space over K. Let f ∈Xd and g ∈Y d. We
deﬁne the tensor product f ⊗g of the linear functionals f and g by setting
(f ⊗g)(x, y) := f(x)g(y)
for all
x ∈X, y ∈Y.
Obviously, we have (f ⊗g) ∈M2(X, Y ; K). If X is a ﬁnite-dimensional space with
the basis b1, . . . bn, then each B ∈M2(X, Y ; K) can be uniquely represented by
B =
n
X
k,l=1
B(bk, bl)bk ⊗bl.
(3.1)
This will be proved in Problem 3.1 on page 167. For inﬁnite-dimensional linear
spaces X and Y , the bilinear functional B : X ⊗Y →K is called decomposable iﬀ
it can be represented by a ﬁnite sum of the form
B = α1f1 ⊗g1 + . . . + αnfn ⊗gn
where fk ∈Xd, gk ∈Y d, αk ∈K, and k = 1, 2, . . . The set of decomposable bi-
linear functionals forms a linear subspace of M2(X, Y ; K), and it coincides with
M2(X, Y ; K) if X and Y are ﬁnite-dimensional spaces. Let X = Y. For f, g ∈Xd,
we deﬁne
f ∧g := f ⊗g −g ⊗f.
The decomposable bilinear functionals
B = α1f1 ∧g1 + . . . + αnfn ∧gn
are antisymmetric, that is, B(x, y) = −B(y, x) for all x, y ∈X.
The algebra M(X) of multilinear functionals. The symbol Mk(X) denotes
the set of all k-linear functionals
F : X × · · · × X →K.
This means that the map (x1, . . . , xk) →F(x1, . . . , xk) is linear in each argument.
The space Mk(X) becomes a linear space over K in a natural way by using linear
combinations of k-linear functionals. If B ∈Mk(X) and C ∈Ml(X), then the
product B ⊗C is deﬁned by
(B ⊗C)(x1, . . . xk, xk+1, . . . , xk+l) := B(x1, . . . , xk)C(xk+1, . . . , xk+l)
for all x1, . . . , xk+l ∈X. Obviously, B ⊗C is an element of Mk+l(X). In addition,
we set

3.2 The Algebra of Multilinear Functionals
121
M0(X) := K
and
α ⊗F = F ⊗α := αF
for all α ∈K and F ∈Mk(X). With respect to the product ⊗, the direct sum
M(X) :=
∞
M
k=0
Mk(X)
becomes an associative algebra over K, which is called the algebra of multilinear
functionals on the linear space X. Explicitly, the elements of M(X) are ﬁnite sums
of the form
α + F1 + F2 + . . .
where α ∈K, and Fk ∈Mk(X) for k = 1, 2 . . .
In particular, the space M1(X)
coincides with the dual space Xd. The algebra M(X) over K possesses an additional
structure, namely, it is graded. By deﬁnition, the elements of Mk(X) are called
homogeneous of degree k. This notion generalizes the degree of a polynomial.
The tensor product X ⊗Y of two linear spaces. Let X and Y be linear
spaces over K where K = R, C. We want to construct a linear space X ⊗Y equipped
with a product x ⊗y for x ∈X and y ∈Y such that the following properties are
valid:
(P) Product property: For all u, x ∈X, v, y ∈Y , and α, β ∈K, we have
(αu + βx) ⊗y = α(u ⊗y) + β(x ⊗y),
x ⊗(αv + βy) = α(x ⊗v) + β(x ⊗y).
(3.2)
(B) Basis property: If x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , ym are linearly independent elements
in the linear spaces X and Y , respectively, then all the elements
xk ⊗yl,
k = 1, . . . , n, l = 1, . . . , m
are linearly independent in the tensor product X ⊗Y.
Property (B) excludes the trivial case where x ⊗y = 0 for all x ∈X, y ∈Y. Let us
now realize these properties by a speciﬁc model based on bilinear functionals. For
x ∈X and y ∈Y , we deﬁne the tensor product x ⊗y by setting
(x ⊗y)(f, g) := f(x)g(y)
for all
f ∈Xd, g ∈Y d.
This means that x ⊗y : Xd × Y d →K is a bilinear functional on the product
space Xd × Y d. By deﬁnition, the tensor product X⊗Y is the linear hull of all the
products x ⊗y with x ∈X and y ∈Y. Explicitly, the elements of X ⊗Y have the
form
α1(x1 ⊗y1) + . . . + αn(xn ⊗yn),
n = 1, 2, . . .
(3.3)
with x1, . . . , xn ∈X, y1, . . . , yn ∈Y , and α1, . . . , αn ∈K. The space X ⊗Y is a
linear subspace of the linear space of all bilinear functionals B : Xd × Y d →K.
Proposition 3.3 The basis property (B) above is valid for the tensor product X⊗Y.
The proof will be given in Problem 4.14 on page 260. Observe that diﬀerent
expressions of the form (3.3) may describe the same element of the space X ⊗Y.
The basis property (B) can be used in order to decide whether two expressions of
the form (3.3) represent the same element of X ⊗Y or not. For example, consider
the equation

122
3. The Power of Combinatorics
x ⊗y = u ⊗v + w ⊗z
(3.4)
where x, u, w ∈X and y, v, z ∈Y. Set
X := span{x, u, w},
Y := span{y, v, z}.
Let b1, . . . , br (resp. c1, . . . , cs) be a basis of X (resp. Y). Then, by the product
property (P) above, we get
x ⊗y =

=

βjγk(bj ⊗ck).
Similarly, we obtain
u ⊗v + w ⊗z =
X
j,k
αjk(bj ⊗ck).
By Prop. 3.3, equation (3.4) is valid iﬀβjγk = αjk for all indices j, k. The general
case proceeds analogously. This argument shows that the following holds: If X and
Y are ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces over K, then X⊗Y is also a ﬁnite-dimensional
linear space over K with the dimension
dim(X ⊗Y ) = dim X · dim Y.
On page 260, we will construct the tensor product X ⊗Y in terms of equivalence
classes. The two constructions yield isomorphic linear spaces. Important are only
the properties (P), (B) above.
The tensor product A⊗B of two algebras. Let A and B be algebras over K
with K = R, C. Since A and B are linear spaces over K, we have the tensor product
A ⊗B at hand. In addition, we deﬁne the product
(a ⊗b)(c ⊗d) := ac ⊗bd
for all a, c ∈A and all b, d ∈B. In a natural way, this deﬁnition can be extended
to expressions of the form (3.3).
Proposition 3.4 The tensor product A ⊗B is an algebra over K.
The proof will be given in Problem 4.17 on page 261. We have to show that the
product on A × B does not depend on the choice of the representations (3.3). To
this end, we will use the language of equivalence classes.
Tensor products will be studied in greater detail in Vol. III. In terms of physics,
tensor products are used in order to describe composite particles. For example, the
tensor product ϕ ⊗ψ of the two states ϕ and ψ of single particles is the state of
the composite particle. In terms of mathematics, tensor products are used in order
to reduce multilinear functionals to linear operators on tensor products.
3.3 Fusion, Splitting, and Hopf Algebras
In nature, one observes fusion and splitting of physical states. From the
mathematical point of view, this corresponds to products and coproducts
of Hopf algebras, respectively.
Folklore
In this section, we will use tensor products in order to deﬁne Hopf algebras. In
particular, the language of tensor products will tell us why coassociativity (CA)
and counitality (CU) are dual concepts to associativity (A) and unitality (U) of
algebras (see page 128).

3.3 Fusion, Splitting, and Hopf Algebras
123
3.3.1 The Bialgebra of Linear Diﬀerential Operators
For a beginner, the deﬁnition of a Hopf algebra seems to be rather involved. To
help the reader, we start with the well-known algebra LE(RN) of linear diﬀeren-
tial operators with respect to N arguments and constant coeﬃcients. This is the
prototype of a Hopf algebra.
To begin with, ﬁx the dimension N = 1, 2, . . . The points of the space RN
are denoted by x = (x1, . . . , xN). Recall that E(RN) denotes the space of smooth
complex-valued functions
f : RN →C.
We introduce the partial derivative ∂j :=
∂
∂xj . For smooth functions f, we have
∂j∂kf = ∂k∂jf. This means that we have the commutativity property
∂j∂k = ∂k∂j,
j, k = 1, . . . , N.
Furthermore, we set
∂α := ∂α1
1 ∂α2
2
· · · ∂αN
N
where α1, . . . , αN are nonnegative integers. Deﬁne |α| := α1 + . . . + αN. By a linear
diﬀerential operator with respect to N arguments and constant coeﬃcients, we
understand the symbol
D := a0 +
X
0<|α|≤m
aα∂α,
m = 1, 2, . . .
Here, the coeﬃcients aα are complex numbers. The positive integer m is called the
order of the diﬀerential operator. We set m := 0 if D := a0. We also introduce the
symbol
ε(D) := a0.
For example, if N = 2 we may choose
D := a0 + a1∂1 + a2∂2 + a11∂1∂1 + a12∂1∂2 + a22∂2∂2.
Obviously, if f : RN →C is a smooth function, then so is Df. More precisely, the
operator
D : E(RN) →E(RN)
is linear. The set of all these linear operators is denoted by LE(RN). There exist
the following operations:
• Linear combination: αD + α′D′.
• Product: DD′.
• Coproduct (Leibniz rule): Δ(D)(f, g) := D(fg).
• Coinverse (integration by parts): For all functions f, g ∈D(RN), we have
Z
RN (Df)g dNx =
Z
RN fS(D)g dNx.
This way, the set LE(RN) becomes a complex algebra, which is associative, com-
mutative, and unital. The unit element 1 is the constant operator D := 1. We
have
ε(1) = 1.
Summarizing, we obtain the following:
The algebra LE(RN) of diﬀerential operators is a Hopf algebra.

124
3. The Power of Combinatorics
This will be discussed in the sequel.6 We will use the following terminology.
• The map D →Δ(D) is called the coproduct of the Hopf algebra LE(RN), and
Δ(D) is called the coproduct applied to the diﬀerential operator D.
• The map D →ε(D) is called the counit of the Hopf algebra LE(RN). The complex
number ε(D) = a0 is called the augmentation of the diﬀerential operator D.
• The map D →S(D) is called the coinverse (or the antipode) of the Hopf algebra
LE(RN). The diﬀerential operator S(D) is called the coinverse of the diﬀerential
operator D.
The explicit form of Δ and S will be given below, by using the Leibniz rule and
integration by parts, respectively. In particular, we will see that the coproduct is a
map of the form
Δ : LE(RN) →LE(RN) ⊗LE(RN),
which describes a decomposition (splitting) of diﬀerential operators. In contrast to
this, the product (D, D′) →DD′ describes a fusion of the two diﬀerential operators
D and D′.
The tensor product of linear diﬀerential operators. We are given the
operators D, D′ ∈LE(RN). For all functions f, g ∈E(RN), we deﬁne the tensor
product D ⊗D′ by setting
(D ⊗D′)(f, g) := (Df)(D′g).
The Leibniz rule. For smooth functions f, g ∈E(RN), we have the product
rule
∂j(fg) = (∂jf)g + f∂jg,
j = 1, . . . , N,
(3.5)
which is also called the Leibniz rule. Iterated application yields
∂k∂j(fg) = (∂k∂jf)g + ∂jf∂kg + ∂kf∂jg + f∂k∂jg.
(3.6)
The binomic formula tells us that (a + b)n = an + Pn−1

for n = 2, 3, . . . , we get

The coproduct. Let D ∈LE(RN). We deﬁne the coproduct Δ(D) of the linear
diﬀerential operator D by setting
Δ(D)(f, g) := D(fg),
for all
f, g ∈E(RN).
(3.7)
Let us ﬁrst consider some examples. If D = 1, then Δ(1)(f, g) = fg. Hence
Δ(1) = 1 ⊗1.
By the Leibniz rule (3.5), Δ(∂j)(f, g) = (∂j ⊗1 + 1 ⊗∂j)(f, g). Hence
6 In 2004 Christian Brouder (Laboratoire de min´eralogie-cristallographie, Paris)
gave a fascinating lecture at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in the
Sciences (Leipzig) entitled Hopf algebras and quantum ﬁeld theory. I will follow
this lecture, and I am very grateful to Christian Brouder for sending me the
manuscript of his lecture.

3.3 Fusion, Splitting, and Hopf Algebras
125
Δ(∂j) = ∂j ⊗1 + 1 ⊗∂j,
j = 1, . . . , N.
By (3.6), we get
Δ(∂k∂j)(f, g) = (∂k∂j ⊗1)(f, g) + (∂j ⊗∂k)(f, g)
+(∂k ⊗∂j)(f, g) + (1 ⊗∂k∂j)(f, g).
Hence
Δ(∂k∂j) = ∂k∂j ⊗1 + ∂j ⊗∂k + ∂k ⊗∂j + 1 ⊗∂k∂j.
(3.8)
This corresponds to the four possible splittings of the product ∂k∂j:
∂k∂j ⊗1,
∂j ⊗∂k,
∂k ⊗∂j,
1 ⊗∂k∂j.
To simplify notation, in what follows we will write ΔD instead of Δ(D).
The Sweedler notation. Let f, g ∈E(RN). In the general case, we obtain
(ΔD)(f, g) =
K
X
k=1
D1,kfD2,kg
for all
f, g ∈E(RN).
This means that (ΔD)(f, g) = PK
k=1(D1,k ⊗D2,k)(f, g). Hence
ΔD =
K
X
k=1
D1,k ⊗D2,k.
To simplify notation, we brieﬂy write
ΔD =
X
D
D(1) ⊗D(2).
(3.9)
This is the so-called Sweedler notation. In what follows, we set A := LE(RN). Then
the coproduct represents a map of the type
Δ : A →A ⊗A,
which is an algebra morphism. In fact, the map Δ is linear, and we have
Δ(D′D) = (ΔD′)(ΔD)
for all
D′, D ∈A.
(3.10)
The proof will be given in Problem 3.5 on page 169.
Coassociativity. It follows from the associative law f(gh) = (fg)h for func-
tions f, g, h ∈E(RN) and from the deﬁning relation (3.7) that
(ΔD)(f, gh) = (ΔD)(fg, h).
This is called the coassociative law for the coproduct. We want to show that this
is equivalent to the following relation:
(Δ ⊗id)Δ = (id ⊗Δ)Δ.
(3.11)
To prove this, observe ﬁrst that

D(2) D(2)(1)gD(2)(2)h is equal to

Recalling that ΔD = P
D D(1) ⊗D(2) and (id ⊗Δ)(a ⊗b) = a ⊗Δb, we obtain
(id ⊗Δ)ΔD = (Δ ⊗id)ΔD.
This proves the claim (3.11).
The counit. For the diﬀerential operator D = a0 + P
0<|α|≤m ∂α, recall the
deﬁnition ε(D) := a0. The map
ε : A →C
is an algebra morphism, that is, the map ε is linear and ε(DD′) = ε(D)ε(D′) for
all D, D′ ∈A. We want to show that
(ε ⊗id)Δ = (id ⊗ε)Δ = id,
(3.12)

3.3 Fusion, Splitting, and Hopf Algebras
127
where id : A →A denotes the identical operator on the algebra A. In fact, using
the relation
ΔD(1, g) = D(1g) = Dg
together with the Sweedler notation ΔD = P
D D(1) ⊗D(2), we get
Dg =

ε(D(1))D(2) = D.
Similarly, (id ⊗ε)ΔD = P
D D(1)ε(D(2)) = D. This yields the claim (3.12).
The coinverse. For the diﬀerential operator D = a0 + P
0<|α|≤m aα∂α, we
deﬁne the coinverse S(D) by setting
S(D) := a0 +
X
0<|α|≤m
(−1)αaα∂α.
For example, S(1) = 1, S(∂j) = −∂j, and S(∂j∂k) = ∂j∂k for j, k = 1, . . . , N. Using
the coinverse, the formula of integration by parts reads as
Z
RN (Df)g dNx =
Z
RN fS(D)g dxN
for all
f, g ∈D(RN).
Using the Sweedler notation ΔD = P

D(1)S(D(2)) = ε(D)1.

In the sense of the general deﬁnition given next, the operator algebra LE(RN) is a
Hopf algebra.

3. The Power of Combinatorics
3.3.2 The Deﬁnition of Hopf Algebras
The canonical morphisms of an associative unital algebra. Let A be an
associative unital complex algebra A with the unit element 1. For all a, b ∈A and
all complex numbers z, we deﬁne the following maps:
(i) Multiplication map: μ(a ⊗b) := ab.
(ii) Unitality map: η(z) := z1.
(iii) Identical map: id(a) := a.
Using linear extension, we get the following three algebra morphisms:
μ : A ⊗A →A,
η : C →A,
id : A →A.
These so-called three canonical morphisms of the algebra A have the following
properties:
(A) Associativity: μ(μ ⊗id) = μ(id ⊗μ).
(U) Unitality: μ(η ⊗id) = μ(id ⊗η) = id.
Let us prove this. Relation (A) follows from the associative law a(bc) = (ab)c for
all a, b, c ∈A. In fact,
μ(id ⊗μ)(a ⊗b ⊗c) = μ(a ⊗μ(b ⊗c)) = μ(a ⊗bc) = a(bc).
Similarly, μ(μ ⊗id)(a ⊗b ⊗c) = (ab)c. This proves (A). Relation (U) follows from
μ(η ⊗id)(1 ⊗a) = μ(η(1) ⊗a) = μ(1 ⊗a) = 1a = a.
Similarly, μ(id ⊗η)(a ⊗1) = a1 = a. This yields (U) if we identify a ⊗1 and 1 ⊗a
with a. This corresponds to the isomorphisms A ⊗C = A = C ⊗A.
Dualization and the deﬁnition of bialgebras. It is our goal to dualize the
relations (A) and (U) above by using the replacement
μ ⇒Δ,
η ⇒ε
and by commuting the factors. This way, we obtain the following two dual relations:
(CA) Coassociativity: (id ⊗Δ)Δ = (Δ ⊗id)Δ.
(CU) Counitality: (id ⊗ε)Δ = (ε ⊗id)Δ = id.
Let A be an associative unital complex algebra. Such an algebra is called a complex
bialgebra iﬀthere exist two algebra morphisms
(i) Δ : A →A ⊗A (coproduct) and
(ii) ε : A →C (counit)
such that the conditions (CA) and (CU) are satisﬁed. The counitality map ε is also
called the augmentation map.
The deﬁnition of Hopf algebras. The complex bialgebra A is called a Hopf
algebra iﬀthere exists a linear map S : A →A such that
μ(S ⊗id)Δ = μ(id ⊗S)Δ = ηε.
(3.15)
This condition looks strange at the ﬁrst glance. However, we will show below that
this is a very natural condition in terms of both Sweedler’s notation and a convo-
lution on the space of linear operators L(A, A) on the algebra A.
Hopf algebra morphism. Let A and A′ be Hopf algebras. The map

morphism.7
The Sweedler notation. For carrying out concrete computations, one fre-
quently uses the so-called Sweedler notation in bialgebras. Let a ∈A. The co-
product Δa is contained in the tensor product A ⊗A. Thus, there exist elements
a1, . . . , am, b1, . . . , bm ∈A such that
Δa =
m
X
j=1
aj ⊗bj.
According to Sweedler, we write this as
Δa =
X
a
a(1) ⊗a(2).
(3.18)
In this language, the basic relations of a Hopf algebra read as follows.
(i) Coassociativity: P
a a(1)
P

X
a

@X
a(1)

A a(2).
For this, we simply write P
a a(1) ⊗a(2) ⊗a(3). Intuitively, this reﬂects the
regular behavior of splittings.
(ii) Counit: P
a ε(a(1))a(2) = P
a a(1)ε(a(2)) = a.
(iii) Coinverse: P
a a(1)Sa(2) = P
a(Sa(1))a(2) = ε(a)1.
Condition (iii) refers to the product on the algebra A. The coinverse is also called
antipode.
As we will show later on, the coinverse lies at the heart of renormalization
in quantum ﬁeld theory.
7 Bialgebra morphisms refer to (3.16), that is, the condition (3.17) on the coinverse
drops out.

3. The Power of Combinatorics
Commutative and cocommutative Hopf algebras. The Hopf algebra A is
called commutative iﬀab = ba for all a, b ∈A. Moreover, A is called cocommutative
iﬀthe factors of the summands of the coproduct can be interchanged, that is,
Δa =

Convolution. Consider again an associative unital complex algebra A equipped
with the additional structure of a bialgebra. We want to introduce a convolution
on the space L(A, A) of linear operators B : A →A. Let B, C ∈L(A, A) be given.
We deﬁne
(B ∗C)a :=
X
a
Ba(1)Ca(2)
for all
a ∈A.
Then B ∗C ∈L(A, A). In other words, B ∗C = μ(B ⊗C)Δ. This means that the
convolution B ∗C is obtained by the following quite natural composition of maps:
A
Δ
 A ⊗A
B⊗C  A ⊗A
μ
 A.
Proposition 3.5 The convolution on L(A, A) is associative and has the unit ele-
ment ηε.
Explicitly, this means that, for all B, C, D ∈L(A, A), we have
(B ∗C) ∗D = B ∗(C ∗D),
B ∗ηε = ηε ∗B = B.
The proof can be found in Problem 3.7 on page 170. Using this notion of convolution,
the deﬁning relation (3.15) of the coinverse S can be elegantly written as
S ∗id = id ∗S = ηε
where id is the identical map on A. This means the following:
The complex bialgebra A is a Hopf algebra iﬀthere exists a linear map
S : A →A which is the two-sided inverse of the identical map on A for
the convolution on L(A, A).
Historical remarks. Hopf algebras were studied ﬁrst by Heinz Hopf (1894–
1971) in 1941 in order to compute the cohomology of Lie groups and more general
topological spaces.

Math. 42 (1941), 22–52 (in German).
This can be found in
E. Spanier, Algebraic Topology, Springer, New York, 1989.
In what follows, we will study the relation of Hopf algebras to both
• power series expansions and
• symmetry.
Roughly speaking, Hopf algebras are frequently used in order to carry out sophisti-
cated computations for problems where a nontrivial symmetry is behind. Using the
language of commutative diagrams, it turns out that a bialgebra can be understood
best as a mathematical concept which combines the concept of algebra with its dual
concept. One only has to reinverse the arrows in the commutative diagrams of an
algebra. This will be thoroughly considered in Problem 3.4 on page 168. Hopf alge-
bras are bialgebras which carry the additional structure of a coinverse. Typically,
the coinverse comes from dualizing the inverse of a group structure (see Sect. 3.5.2).

3.4 Power Series Expansion and Hopf Algebras
3.4.1 The Importance of Cancellations
The big surprise in renormalization theory is the appearance of unexpected
huge cancellations in the lengthy computations.
Folklore
It happens quite often in mathematics and physics that extremely complicated
long expressions dramatically simplify by rearranging them as alternating sums
and by cancelling the alternating terms. As the simplest example, let us mention
the product
(1 −x)(1 + x + x2 + . . . + x1000) = (1 + x + x2 + . . . + x1000) −(x + x2 + . . . + x1001).
Rearranging this, we get
1 + x −x + x2 −x2 + . . . + x1000 −x1000 −x1001.
Thus, most of the terms cancel, and we ﬁnally get the simple expression
(1 −x)(1 + x + x2 + . . . + x1000) = 1 −x1001.
As a nontrivial example, let us mention that the elegant heat-kernel approach to
the sophisticated Atiyah–Singer index theorem for elliptic diﬀerential operators
on compact manifolds was discovered by Atiyah, Bott, and Patodi in 1973; they
noticed completely unexpected cancellations in long formulas related to the spectral
geometry on manifolds.8 It is typical for topology that topological invariants are
related to alternating sums. The prototype is the Euler characteristic (see Sect. 5.6.2
in Vol. I). Unexpected cancellations are also typical for quite lengthy computations
in renormalization theory.9 The experience of mathematicians and physicists shows
that symmetries are behind cancellations. It turns out that the cancellations in
renormalization theory can be based on Hopf algebras. As a prototype, we want to
study the Fa`a di Bruno Hopf algebra related to the local diﬀeomorphism group in
the complex plane. As a preparation for this, we need two classical formulas for the
coeﬃcients of power series expansions, namely,
• the Lagrange inversion formula (3.20) related to the famous Kepler equation
(3.19) in celestial mechanics, and
• the Fa`a di Bruno composition formula (3.30).
Let us study these two formulas ﬁrst.

3. The Power of Combinatorics
3.4.2 The Kepler Equation and the Lagrange Inversion Formula
The Kepler equation and the implicit function theorem. Let x, y be Carte-
sian coordinates in the plane, and denote time by the parameter t. According to
Kepler (1571–1630), the motion x = x(t), y = y(t) of a planet of mass m around
the sun of mass msun is given by the equation
x = a cos u −ea,
y = b sin u,
t = τ ·
r
ma3
Gmsun
with the so-called Kepler equation
u = τ + e sin u.
(3.19)
This equation relates the parameter τ to the Kepler parameter u. Here, we use the
following notation: G gravitational constant, e eccentricity of the ellipse (0 ≤e < 1),
a major semi-axis, and b minor semi-axis. The diﬀerence τ := u −e sin u was called
the mean anomaly by Kepler.10 The orbit of the planet is given by the following
ellipse:
(x + ea)2
a2
+ y2
b2 = 1.
The sun is located at the focal point (x, y) = (−ea, 0). For the relation between the
major and minor semi-axis, we have b = a
√
1 −e2.
Suppose we ware given the time t and we want to compute the position (x, y)
of the planet at the time t. Then we have to solve the Kepler equation in order to
get u = u(τ). Setting F(u, τ) := u −e sin u −τ, the Kepler equation (3.19) can be
written as
F(u, τ) = 0.
Here, we have F(0, 0) = 0 and Fu(0, 0) = 1 −e. Since Fu(0, 0) ̸= 0 and the function
(u, τ) →F(u, τ) is analytic on the product space C × C, the implicit function
theorem11 tells us that there exists an open neighborhood U of the point (0, 0) in
the product space C×C such that the Kepler equation (3.19) has a unique solution
curve u = u(τ). This curve is analytic. In other words, there exists a positive
number τ0 such that, for each complex number τ with |τ| < τ0, equation (3.19) has
the solution
u = b0 + b1τ + b2τ 2 + . . . ,
where the power series is convergent. This solution can be computed by the following
iterative method
un+1 = τ + e sin un,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
with u0 := 0. Then u1 = τ, u2 = τ + e sin τ, . . . More elegantly, one can use the
famous Lagrange inversion formula from 1771:
u = τ + e sin τ + e2
2!
d
dτ sin2 τ + . . . + en
n!
dn−1
dτ n−1 sinn τ + . . . .
(3.20)
Laplace (1749–1827) proved that this power series is convergent if |τ| < τ0 with
τ0 := 0.6627.12 For computing the orbit of a planet, one needs the power series
10 In the special case where e = 0, the orbit is a circle of radius a = b and angular
variable u.
11 We refer to Zeidler (1986), Vol. 1, Sect. 4.7 (see the references on page 1049).

The Lagrange equation. Starting from the Kepler equation, Lagrange (1736–
1813) studied in 1771 the more general equation13
u = τ + eϕ(u).
(3.21)
Here, we assume that τ and e are complex parameters which vary in a neighborhood
of the origin in the Gaussian plane C, and that the function u →ϕ(u) is holomorphic
in a neighborhood of the origin u = 0 in C. By the implicit function theorem,
equation (3.21) has a solution u = u(τ, e) which is unique for all points (τ, e) in a
suﬃciently small neighborhood V of the origin (0, 0) in the product space C × C.
Moreover, the function (τ, e) →u(τ, e) is holomorphic on V. Lagrange showed that

The formulas (3.22) and (3.23) hold for all points (τ, e) in a suﬃciently small open
neighborhood of the origin (0, 0) in C×C. The proof will be given in Problem 3.12.
The inversion of a convergent power series. Suppose that the power series
f(x) = f1x + f2
2! x2 + f3
3! x3 + . . .
(3.24)
with complex coeﬃcients f1, f2, f3, . . . is convergent in an open neighborhood of the
origin x = 0 in the Gaussian plane C. Assume that f1 ̸= 0. Then the map f is a
local diﬀeomorphism at the origin. This means that the equation
y = f(x),
x ∈U(0)
can be uniquely solved in an open neighborhood U(0) of the point y = 0 in C, and
the unique solution x = f −1(y) is holomorphic in an open neighborhood of y = 0
in C. We write
f −1(y) = g1 + g2
2! y2 + +g3
3! y3 + . . .

3. The Power of Combinatorics
To simplify the following formulas, let us assume that f1 := 1. Furthermore, we set
f(x) = x + bx2 + cx3 + dx4 + . . . , f −1(y) = Ay + By2 + Cy3 + Dy4 + . . .
The unknown coeﬃcients A, B, C, D, . . . can be determined by using the substitu-
tion
y = f(x(y)) = (Ay + By2 + Cy3 + . . .) + b(Ay + By2 + Cy3 + . . .)2 + . . .
Then comparison of coeﬃcients yields A = 1 and
B = −b,
C = −c + 2b2,
D = −d + 5bc −15b3.
(3.26)
For higher-order terms, the formulas become more and more complex.
The challenge is to understand this complicated combinatorics.
For getting the classical solution of this problem, we will follow Lagrange. To this
end, we set
ψ(x) := f1 + f2
2! x + f3
3! x2 + . . . ,
and we assume that f1 ̸= 0. Then we have to solve the equation y = f(x) with
f(x) = xψ(x), that is,
x = yϕ(x),
x ∈U(0)
with ϕ(x) :=
1
ψ(x). By (3.22), this yields the famous Lagrange inversion formula

This formula is valid for all complex numbers y in a suﬃciently small open neigh-
borhood of the origin y = 0 in the complex plane.
3.4.3 The Composition Formula for Power Series
Francesco Fa`a di Bruno (1825–1888) (beatiﬁed in 1988) gave a formula
equivalent to (3.30) below about a hundred and ﬁfty years ago.14
H´ector Figueroa and Jos´e Gracia–Bondia, 2005
The inversion of a formal power series. If the expression f(x) from (3.24) only
represents a formal power series, that it, the series is divergent for all x ̸= 0, then
we deﬁne the formal power series f −1(y) by the Lagrange formula (3.27), by using
formal diﬀerentiation. Then we have the key relations
f −1(f(x)) = x,
f(f −1(y)) = y
for the symbols x and y. This is to be understood in the sense of formal substitution.
Our next goal is to understand the relation to combinatorics and Hopf algebras.
We start with the two formal power series expansions

with complex coeﬃcients f1, f2, f3 . . . and g1, g2, g3 . . . Consider the composed map

and so on. For computing an arbitrary coeﬃcient hk, one only needs to carry out
a ﬁnite number of algebraic operations. However, the formulas become more and
more complex. It is our goal to obtain a formula which is valid for all h1, h2, h3, . . .
This is the Fa`a di Bruno formula (3.30) below.
Generalized binomial coeﬃcients, partitions, and the Bell polynomi-
als. Let n = 1, 2, . . . and k = 1, . . . , n. Moreover, let λ := (λ1, . . . , λn) denote a
tuple of nonnegative integers with
λ1 + λ2 + . . . + λn = k,
λ1 + 2λ2 + . . . + nλn = n.

This coeﬃcient allows a simple interpretation in terms of partitions. Suppose that
in a partition of the set {1, 2, . . . , n} into k blocks there are λ1 singletons, λ2 two
elements subsets, and so on. This means that (3.29) holds. Then the number of all
the partitions of this type is equal to

3.4.4 The Fa`a di Bruno Hopf Algebra for the Formal

The Fa`a di Bruno Hopf algebras are of the same general type as the
Kreimer–Connes–Moscovici Hopf algebras; they are in fact Hopf subal-
gebras of the Connes–Moscovici Hopf algebras. The latter appeared in
connection with the index formula for transversally elliptic diﬀerential op-
erators on a foliation.16

χn(f) := fn,
n = 1, 2, . . .
This map sends the formal power series f to its nth coeﬃcient fn. For all indices
n, m = 1, 2, all formal power series f, g ∈G, and all complex numbers, we deﬁne
the following operations:
(i) Linear combination: (αχn + βχm)(f) := αχn(f) + βχm(f).
(ii) Product: (χnχm)(f) := χn(f)χm(f).
(iii) Coproduct: (Δχn)(g, f) := χn(f ◦g).
(iv) Counit: ε(χn) := χn(1).
(v) Coinverse: (Sχn)(f) := χn(f −1).
Explicitly,
ε(χn) =
(
1
if
n = 1,
0
otherwise.
By (3.28), special cases of the coproduct read as
Δχ1 = χ1 ⊗χ1,
Δχ2 = χ2 ⊗χ1 + χ2
1 ⊗χ2,
(3.33)
Δχ3 = χ3 ⊗χ1 + χ3
1 ⊗χ3 + 3χ2χ1 ⊗χ2,
Δχ4 = χ4 ⊗χ1 + χ4
1 ⊗χ4 + 6χ2χ2
1 ⊗χ3 + (3χ2
2 + 4χ3χ1) ⊗χ2.
For example, Δχ2(g, h) = χ2(g)χ1(f)+χ1(g)2χ2(f) = g2f1 +g2
1f2, which coincides
with (3.28). More generally, it follows from Sect. 3.4.3 that

Sχ4 = −χ4 + 10χ2χ3 −15χ3

In the general case, the coinverse Sχn, n = 1, 2, . . . , is explicitly given by the La-
grange inversion formula for the power series coeﬃcients of inverse functions. Dif-
ferent formulations will be considered in the next section (e.g., the generalized
Zimmermann forest formula).
The Hopf algebra. Let the symbol C[χ1, χ2, . . .] denote the complex algebra
generated by the coordinate functions χ1, χ2, . . . Explicitly, the elements of this

Equipped with the usual linear combinations and products of polynomials, the
algebra C[χ1, χ2, . . .] is a complex commutative algebra with the complex number
1 as unit element.17 By multilinearity, we extend the coproduct Δ, the counit ε
and the coinverse S to C[χ1, χ2, . . .]. For example, we deﬁne the coproduct of an
algebra element
17 This can be identiﬁed with the constant function χ1.

The corresponding formulas for ε and S are obtained by replacing Δ by ε and S,
respectively. Note that Δχn : G × G →C is a function of two variables f, g ∈G,
and the product ΔχnΔχm refers to the product of functions of two variables, that
is (ΔχnΔχm)(g, f) := (Δχn)(g, f) · Δχm(g, f).
Proposition 3.6 The algebra C[χ1, χ2, . . .] is a commutative Hopf algebra.
The proof proceeds similarly to the proof given in Problem 3.10 on page 170.
3.4.5 The Generalized Zimmermann Forest Formula
The coinverse (also called antipode) of Hopf algebras allows us to elegantly
describe complicated inversion processes in mathematics and physics.
Folklore
It turned out that the whole iterative and intricate structure of renor-
malization theory could be mapped to the theory of Hopf algebras, with
Zimmermann’s forest formula for the counterterm coming along as an-
tipode.18
Dirk Kreimer, 1994
The iterative formula for the coinverse. The coinverse can be computed by
the following iterative formula:
Sχn = −χn −
“X
a(1)Sa(2) −Sχn −χn
”
,
n = 2, 3, . . .
(3.36)
where we have
Δχn =
X
a(1) ⊗a(2),
in the Sweedler notation. Moreover, Sχ1 = χ1, and χ1 = 1. Let us discuss formula
(3.36). Observe ﬁrst that this is a trivial identity. In fact, since ε(χn) = 0 for
n = 2, 3, . . . and μ(id ⊗S)Δ = ηε, we get
μ(id ⊗S)Δ(χn) = ηε(χn) = 0,
n = 2, 3, . . . .
This implies
μ(id ⊗S)
X
a(1) ⊗a(2) = μ
“X

a(1)Sa(2) = 0.
Secondly, the right-hand side of (3.36) does not explicitly contain the term Sχn.
This follows from Δ(χn) = χn ⊗χ1 + χn
1 ⊗χn + . . . and hence
X
a(1)Sa(2) = χnSχ1 + χn
1 Sχn + . . . = χn + Sχn + . . . ,
n = 2, 3, . . .
Let us use (3.36) in order to successively compute Sχ2, Sχ3, and Sχ4.

Sχ2 = −χ2 + (χ2Sχ1 + χ2
1Sχ2 −Sχ2 −χ2) = −χ2.
(ii) n = 3. By Δχ3 = χ3 ⊗χ1 + χ3
1 ⊗χ3 + 3χ2χ1 ⊗χ2,
Sχ3 = −χ3 −3χ2χ1Sχ2 = −χ3 + 3χ2
2.
(iii) n = 4. By Δχ4 = χ4 ⊗χ1 + χ4
1 ⊗χ4 + 6χ2χ2

Sχ4 = −χ4 −6χ2Sχ3 −(3χ2

= −χ4 −6χ2(−χ3 + 3χ2
2) + (3χ2
2 + 4χ3)χ2
= −χ4 −15χ3
2 + 10χ2χ3.
Next we want to get global explicit formulas for the coinverse which are not based
on an iterative process.
The alternating coinverse formula. We have Sχ1 = χ1, Sχ2 = −χ2, and
Sχn = −χn +

To simplify notation, the arguments of the Bell polynomials are suppressed. For
example, we get Sχ3 = −χ3 + B32χ2 = −χ3 + 3χ2
2. Furthermore,
Sχ4 = −χ4 + B4,2χ2 + B4,3χ3 −B4,3B3,2χ2
= −χ4 + 3χ3
2 + 4χ2χ3 + 6χ2χ3 −18χ3
2 = −χ4 + 10χ2χ3 −15χ3
2.
Finally, let us compute
Sχ5 = −χ5 + (B5,2χ2 + B5,3χ3 + B5,4χ4)
−(B5,4B4,3χ3 + B5,4B4,2χ2 + B5,3B3,2χ2) + B5,4B4,3B3,2χ2

The sophisticated Zimmermann type cancellation formula. The com-
putations above are based on cancellations. Now we will formulate a formula for
the coinverse which works in a much simpler way. For n = 2, 3, . . . , this elegant
formula reads as

This is also called the generalized Zimmermann forest formula. For example,

Remark. The iterative formula (3.36) represents a model for the Bogoliubov it-
erative formula in the Bogoliubov–Parasiuk–Hepp–Zimmermann (BPHZ) approach
to the renormalization of quantum ﬁeld theories. Similarly, the condensed coinverse
formula (3.38) represents a model for the famous Zimmermann forest formula in the
BPHZ approach. It is a general phenomenon observed in combinatorics that one
frequently encounters alternating sums. As a rule, such formulas are not optimal,
since huge cancellations occur.
It is the goal of combinatorics to get optimal formulas which contain a
minimal number of cancellations.
Such optimal formulas like (3.38) are not easy to get. The elementary proofs of the
coinverse formulas (3.37) and (3.36) above can be found in Figueroa and Gracia-
Bondia (2005) (see the reference on page 136). For the sophisticated proof of the
condensed coinverse formula (3.38), we refer to:
W. Schmitt, Antipodes and incidence Hopf coalgebras, J. Combinatorial
Theory A46 (1987), 264–290.
M. Haimann and W. Schmitt, Incidence algebra antipodes and Lagrange
inversion in one and several variables, J. Combinatorial Theory A50
(1989), 172–189.
This proof is based on the modern theory of incidence Hopf algebras in combina-
torics. The generalized Zimmermann forest formula (3.38) is a high-light in combi-
natorics.

3.4.7 Correlation Functions in Quantum Field Theory
In the perturbative approach to quantum ﬁeld theory, combinatorial for-
mulas are used for computing correlation functions of interacting quantum
ﬁelds by means of simpler correlation functions of free ﬁelds.
Folklore
Let us brieﬂy discuss the relation between the Fa`a di Bruno Hopf algebra and several
types of correlation functions. Quantum ﬁeld theories are described by correlation
functions
Cn(x1, x2, . . . , xn),
n = 2, 3, . . .
which describe the correlations between the quantum ﬁeld at the diﬀerent space-
time points x1, x2, . . . , xn. As a rule, the correlation functions have strong singu-
larities if two space-time points coincide. In combinatorics, a basic tool is given by
generating functions. Motivated by this, let us set
Z[J] := 1 +
∞
X
n=1
in
n!ℏn
Z
R4n Cn(x1, . . . , xn)J(x1) · · · J(xn)d4x1 · · · d4xn

∞
X
n=1
in
n!ℏn
Z
R4n Cn,red(x1, . . . , xn)J(x1) · · · J(xn)d4x1 · · · d4xn.
Here, Cn (resp. Cn,red) is called the n-correlation function (resp. the reduced n-
correlation function). We assume that the functions Cn and Cn,red with n = 1, 2, . . .
are symmetric with respect to all the arguments. The proof of the following propo-
sition will be given in Problem 3.14 on page 173.
Proposition 3.7 Let n = 1, 2, . . . Suppose that we have
Cn(x1, . . . , xn) =
n
X
k=1
X
p∈Πn,k
 Y
p

(x1, . . . , xn)
for all arguments x1, . . . , xn ∈R4. Then, Z[J] = eZred[J], in the sense of a formal
power series.
The symbol P
p∈Πn,k
“Q
p Cred)(x1, . . . xn
”
means that we sum over all possible
partitions p of the set {1, . . . , n} into k blocks. For each partition p, we consider
a product of reduced correlation functions whose arguments are given by p. For
example, we have C1(x1) = C1,red(x1). Furthermore,
C2(x1, x2) = C1,red(x1)C1,red(x2) + C2,red(x1, x2)
and

142
3. The Power of Combinatorics
C3(x1, x2, x3) = C1,red(x1)C1,red(x2)C1,red(x3) + C1,red(x1)C2,red(x2, x3)
+C1,red(x2)C2,red(x1, x3) + C1,red(x3)C2,red(x1, x2) + C3,red(x1, x2, x3).
If one knows the correlation functions C1, C2, . . ., then the reduced correlation func-
tions C1,red, C2,red, . . . can be computed by means of the basic formula
Zred[J] = ln Z[J].
(3.41)
In particular, if C1 = 0, then C1,red = 0 and
C2,red(x1, x2) = C2(x1, x2).
(3.42)
Furthermore, C3,red = C3 and
C4,red(x1, x2, x3, x4) = C4(x1, x2, x3, x4) −C2(x1, x2)C2(x3, x4)
−C2(x1, x3)C2(x2, x4) −C2(x1, x4)C2(x2, x3)
(3.43)
for all x1, x2, x3, x4 ∈R4. These formulas for the 2-correlation function and the
4-correlation function are encountered in the theory of interacting quantum ﬁelds.
In the special case of free quantum ﬁelds, we have C1,red = 0 and Cn,red = 0 for
all n = 3, 4, . . . All the information about a free quantum ﬁeld is contained in the
2-point correlation function C2.
Physicists use this result in order to simplify the computation of correlation
functions for interacting quantum ﬁelds. It turns out that the reduced correlation
functions Cn,red correspond to connected Feynman graphs (also called Feynman
diagrams), whereas the general correlation functions Cn correspond to all kinds
of (connected or disconnected) Feynman graphs. Therefore, the functions Cn and
Cn,red are also called the n-Green’s function and the connected n-Green’s function,
respectively.
For interacting quantum ﬁelds, it is suﬃcient to investigate connected
Feynman graphs. The eﬀects related to disconnected Feynman graphs can
be reduced to the corresponding eﬀects coming from connected Feynman
graphs.
In other words, the reduced correlation functions form a (nonlinear) basis for gen-
eral correlation functions. This is closely related to the theory of cumulants in
probability theory to be studied in the next section.
It turns out that even the connected Feynman graphs can still have a certain
redundancy. Therefore physicists pass over to Feynman graphs with a nontrivial
topology (called one-particle irreducible graphs). This allows us to reduce the com-
putation of n-correlation functions Cn to both irreducible vertex functions and
2-correlation functions.
Finally, let us discuss the relation to the Fa`a di Bruno Hopf algebra. To this
end, set
Xn := in
ℏn
Z
R4n Cn(x1, . . . , xn)J(x1) · · · J(xn)d4x1 · · · d4xn.
Using the Fa`a di Bruno formula (3.31), we obtain that the exponential function
exp(Zred[J]) = exp

In turn, Proposition 3.7 above tells us that this is equal to Z[J].

3.4.8 Random Variables, Moments, and Cumulants
Generating functions for the moments of random variables represent a
basic tool in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Folklore
The following considerations are basic for the theory of random variables. Let X
and Y be two independent random variables. Then, for the mean values and the
mean ﬂuctuations, we have the following additivity property
X + Y = X + Y ,
(ΔX + ΔY )2 = (ΔX)2 + (ΔY )2.
We want to generalize this to higher moments. The basic idea is to pass from the
multiplicative family of moments to the additive family of cumulants by using the
logarithmic function. In terms of algebra, the passage from cumulants to moments
is given by Schur polynomials. In quantum ﬁeld theory, the passage from moments
to cumulants corresponds to the passage from correlation functions (i.e., Green’s
functions) to reduced correlation functions (i.e., connected Green’s functions). In
terms of Feynman diagrams, this corresponds to a passage from general Feynman
graphs to connected Feynman graphs (see (3.41)). The proofs for the following
statements can be found in Sect. II.12 of the textbook by A. Shiryaev, Probability,
Springer, New York, 1996.
Random variable on the real line. Let ϱ : R →R be a nonnegative smooth
function which rapidly decreases at inﬁnity (i.e., ϱ ∈S(R)) and which satisﬁes
the normalization condition
R
R ϱ(x)dx = 1. The function ϱ generates a probabil-
ity measure μ and a random variable X on the real line with the corresponding
Lebesgue-Stieljes integral
Z
B
fdμ =
Z
B
f(x)ϱ(x)dx.
For each Borel subset B of the real line (e.g., intervals), the measure μ(B) is equal
to μ(B) =
R
B dμ. Moreover, we get
p(X ∈B) = μ(B).
This means the following. Suppose that we measure the variable X in an experi-
ment. Then the probability of ﬁnding the measured value in the set B is equal to
μ(B). For a function f : R →C, we deﬁne the mean value
f(X) :=
Z
R
f(x)dμ(x)
provided this integral exists.This is the case if the function f is smooth and the
function x →|f(x)| has at most polynomial growth at inﬁnity.
Moments. The moments of the random variable X are deﬁned by
mk := Xk =

k = 1, 2, . . .
The characteristic function. The function
ϕX(ξ) := eiξx =

is called the characteristic function to the random variable X. In other words,
this is the Fourier–Stieltjes transform with respect to the probability measure μ.
Diﬀerentiation yields ϕ′
X(0) = i
R
R xdμ(x). Hence
ϕ(k)
X (0) = ikmk
k = 1, 2, . . .
By Taylor expansion,
ϕX(ξ) := 1 +

k=1
ikmk ξk

This way, we obtain the formal power series expansion:
ϕX(ξ) := 1 +
∞
X
k=1
ikmk ξk
k! ,
ξ →0.
Therefore, the characteristic function ϕX is called the generating function for the
moments of the random variable X. The Bochner theorem tells us the following:20
The continuous function χ : R →C with χ(0) = 1 is the characteristic
function of a probability measure on the real line iﬀit is positive deﬁnite,
that is,
n

χ(ξi −ξj)ηiη†
j ≥0,
n = 1, 2, . . .
for all real numbers ξ1, . . . , ξn and all complex numbers η1, . . . , ηn.
This theorem is a jewel in harmonic analysis; it allows important generalizations
concerning the spectral representation of kernels (in the sense of the theory of
distributions).21
Cumulants. We pass from the generating function ϕX to the generating func-
tion
ln ϕX(ξ) =
∞
X
k=1
iksk ξk
k! .
(3.44)
This is a formal power series. The coeﬃcients s1, s2, . . . are called the cumulants of
the random variable X. There exists a one-to-one relation between moments and
cumulants. Explicitly, we get the rescaled Schur polynomials
m1 = s1,
m2 = s2 + s2
1,
m3 = s3 + 3s1s2 + s3
1.
Conversely, we obtain eln ϕX(ξ) = ϕX(ξ), and hence
s1 = m1 = X,
s2 = m2 −m2
1 = (ΔX)2,
s3 = m3 −3m1m2 + 2m3
1.
The crucial additivity property of cumulants. Now consider two random
variables X, Y on the real line which are independent, that is,
p(X ∈B, Y ∈C) = p(X ∈B) · p(Y ∈C)

3.4 Power Series Expansion and Hopf Algebras

for all Borel sets B, C on the real line. In other words, the probability measure of
the random vector (X, Y ) on the plane is the product measure of the measures
corresponding to X and Y . Then we have the product property
ϕX+Y = ϕXϕY
for the generating functions. This implies
ln(ϕX+Y ) = ln ϕX + ln ϕY .
Consequently, for two independent random variables X and Y , the cumulants are
additive quantities, that is,
sk,X+Y = sk,X + sk,Y ,
k = 1, 2, . . .
In particular, we get X + Y = X + Y , and {Δ(X + Y )}2 = (ΔX)2 + (ΔY )2 if we
choose k = 1, 2.
Solution of the moment problem. We want to reconstruct the probability
measure from its moments. This is the moment problem.
Suppose that we are given a sequence m1, m2, . . . of nonnegative numbers
with
lim sup
k→∞
m1/k
k
k
< ∞
and
∞
X
k=1
1
m1/2k
2k
= ∞.
Then there exists a uniquely determined probability measure μ on the real
line such that the numbers m1, m2, . . . are the moments of μ.
The moment problem played an important role in the development of measure
theory and functional analysis. In particular, the Riesz–Markov representation the-
orem (about linear continuous functionals on spaces of real continuous functions
deﬁned on compact sets) and the Hahn–Banach theorem (on the extension of lin-
ear continuous functionals in Banach spaces) were proved for solving the moment
problem. This fascinating history can be found in J. Dieudonn´e, History of Func-
tional Analysis, 1900–1975, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1983. We also refer to J.

Probability measures on the plane. Let ϱ = ϱ(x, y) be a nonnegative
smooth function on the plane with ϱ ∈S(R2) and
R

Here, s0,0 = 0. Then there exists a one-to-one correspondence between the moments

Rn with n = 3, 4, . . . The power series expansions for ϕ and ln ϕ are to be understood
as formal power series expansions.

3.5 Symmetry and Hopf Algebras
Whoever understands symmetries can understand everything in this world.
Folklore
Symmetries play a crucial role in mathematics and physics. As a rule, it is only
possible to explicitly solve a mathematical or physical problem if a certain symmetry
is available. In the history of sciences, mathematicians and physicists encountered
more and more complicated symmetries.
3.5.1 The Strategy of Coordinatization in Mathematics and
Physics
In what follows, we will show that appropriate complex-valued coordinate functions
χj : G →C,
j = 1, 2, . . .
(3.45)
on a group G generate a Hopf algebra denoted by H(G). This is the so-called co-
ordinate algebra of G. In ancient times, mathematicians studied geometric objects.
The ‘coordinatization’ of geometric objects arose in analytic geometry founded by
Descartes (1596–1650).22 The physicist Galilei (1564–1642) wrote:
Measure everything that is measurable, and make measurable everything
that is not yet so.
In terms of physics,
(i) the group G above describes abstract physical quantities, and
(ii) the coordinate functions χ1, χ2, . . . correspond to measurements performed by
an observer.
Typically, the mathematical structure concerning (ii) looks more complicated (e.g.,
Hopf algebras appear) than the mathematical structure concerning (i).23 Further-
more, note the following:
The theory of Hopf algebras allows us to study symmetries which are not
necessarily related to the classical theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras.
For example, this leads to quantum groups. In the physics literature, roughly speak-
ing, Hopf algebras are also called quantum groups. Sometimes, only special Hopf
algebras are called quantum groups (e.g., one-parameter deformations of the en-
veloping algebras of semi-simple Lie algebras).
In (3.45), the translation of properties of the group G into properties of the
coordinate functions corresponds to a general strategy used in mathematics and
physics:
Investigate mathematical objects by studying families of maps deﬁned on
the objects.
In topology, this leads to the crucial concept of cohomology. In physics, this means
that we investigate the properties of the space-time by studying physical ﬁelds
depending on space and time. For the convenience of the reader, let us summarize
mathematical and physical topics which are closely related to the concept of Hopf
algebra:
22 The general strategy of ’coordinatization’ in algebra and algebraic geometry is
studied in I. Shafarevich, Algebra I, Springer, Berlin, 1990 (Encyclopedia of
Mathematical Sciences).

bra.

• Witten’s topological quantum ﬁeld theory and topological invariants of knots
and 3-dimensional manifolds,
• number theory (lattices, modular forms, and zeta functions),
• Frobenius manifolds, quantum cohomology and moduli spaces.
In mathematics and physics, one frequently encounters the solution of problems by
using iterative processes. The prototype of such processes is given by the equation
x −Ax = y
with the solution
x = (I −A)−1y = (I + A + A2 + . . .)y
and the corresponding iterative method
xn+1 = Axn + y,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
with x0 := 0. This yields
x1 = y,
x2 = y + Ay, . . . , xn = y + Ay + Ay2 + . . . An−1y.
However, there are more complicated problems where this simple method fails. As a
rule of thumb, complicated iteration methods are governed by Hopf algebras. Two
important examples are:
• the widely used implicit Runge–Kutta method for solving ordinary diﬀerential
equations in numerical mathematics (the use of Butcher series with respect to
the Hopf algebra of rooted trees for computing the coeﬃcients of the higher-order
methods),
• Feynman diagrams and renormalization.

3.5.2 The Coordinate Hopf Algebra of a Finite Group
Finite groups can equivalently described by incidence numbers.
Folklore
Let G be a ﬁnite group with the unit element e. Let H(G) denote the set of all
complex-valued functions
ϕ : G →C
on the group G. For functions ϕ, ψ ∈H(G), group elements g, h ∈G, and complex
numbers α, β, we deﬁne the following operations:
(i) Linear combination: (αϕ + βψ)(g) := αϕ(g) + βψ(g).
(ii) Product: (ϕψ)(g) := ϕ(g)ψ(g).
(iii) Unit element: 1(g) := 1.
(iv) Coproduct: (Δϕ)(g, h) := ϕ(gh).
(v) Counit: ε(ϕ) := ϕ(e).
(vi) Coinverse: (Sϕ)(g) := ϕ(g−1).
Concerning the deﬁnition of αϕ + βψ, ϕψ, 1, Δ(ϕ), ε(ϕ), and S(ϕ), note the follow-
ing:
• The coproduct Δ sends complex-valued functions g →ϕ(g) of one variable on
the group G to functions (g, h) →ϕ(gh) of two variables by using the group
product gh.
• The counit ε sends complex-valued functions g →ϕ(g) of one variable on the
group G to complex numbers ϕ(e) by using the unit element e of the group.
• The coinverse S sends complex-valued functions g →ϕ(g) of one variable on G
to functions g →ϕ(g−1) of one variable by using the inverse g−1 of the group
element g.
The maps Δ, S, and ε are linear and multiplicative. This means that, for all func-
tions ϕ, ψ : G →C and all complex numbers α, β, we have
Δ(αϕ + βψ) := αΔϕ + βΔψ,
Δ(ϕψ) = ΔϕΔψ.
The same is true if we replace Δ by S (resp. ε).
Recall the following deﬁnition. For given functions ϕ, ψ : G →C, we deﬁne the
tensor product ϕ ⊗ψ by setting
(ϕ ⊗ψ)(g, h) := ϕ(g)ψ(h)
for all
g, h ∈G.
This is a function of the form ϕ⊗ψ : G×G →C. In other words, ϕ⊗ψ is a function
of two variables. Note the following peculiarity which follows from the ﬁniteness of
the group G. The functions
χ : G × G →C
of two variables are in one-to-one correspondence to the elements of the tensor
product H(G) ⊗H(G). We will show this in (3.46) below by using a basis. In this
sense, the coproduct is a map of the form Δ : H(G) →H(G) ⊗H(G).
Proposition 3.8 The algebra H(G) is a commutative Hopf algebra. The dimen-
sion of H(G) is equal to the number of group elements. The Hopf algebra H(G) is
cocommutative iﬀthe group G is commutative.

The proof will be given in Problem 3.11 on page 172.
Basis. Let us formulate the operations of the algebra H(G) in terms of a basis.
Then the coproduct, the counit, and the coinverse can be expressed by using so-
called incidence numbers. Let g1, g2, . . . , gm denote the elements of the group G
where g1 is the unit element e. For j = 1, . . . , m, we introduce the special coordinate
functions χj : G →C by setting (k = 1, . . . , m):
χj(gk) :=
(
1
if
gk = gj,
0
if
gk ̸= gj.
Each function ϕ : G →C can be uniquely represented by the formula
ϕ =
m
X
k=1
αkχk
where αk := ϕ(gk) for k = 1, . . . , m. Thus, the functions χ1, . . . , χm form a basis of
the linear space H(G). Furthermore, each function ψ : G × G →C of two variables,
ψ = ψ(g, h), can be uniquely represented as
ψ =
m
X
j,k=1
αjkχj ⊗χk
(3.46)
with αjk := ψ(gj, gk). This follows from
(χj ⊗χk)(g, h) = χj(g)χk(h)
for all
g, h ∈G.
Consequently, the functions ψ = ψ(g, h) of two variables can be identiﬁed with the
elements of the tensor product H(G) ⊗H(G).
Coproduct. For the coproduct Δ : H(G) →H(G) ⊗H(G), we get
Δχj =
m
X
r,s=1
βjrsχr ⊗χs,
j = 1, . . . , m
with the incidence numbers βjrs := χj(grgs). Explicitly,
βjrs =

if
grgs = gj,
0
otherwise.
Note that βjrs = (Δχj)(gr, gs). The linearity of the coproduct tells us that

The counit. For the counit ε : G →C, we get the incidence numbers

ε(χj) =
(

if
gj = e,
0
otherwise.
Moreover, ε(Pm
j=1 αjχj) = Pm
j=1 αjε(χj).
The coinverse. For the coinverse S : H(G) →H(G), we get

Summarizing, the Hopf algebra H(G) equivalently represents the ﬁnite group G in
terms of incidence numbers for the group operations. This way, the Hopf algebra
H(G) represents a ‘coordinatization’ of the group G.
3.5.3 The Coordinate Hopf Algebra of an Operator Group
Let X be a ﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert space with the complete orthonormal
system b1, b2, . . . , bn. We consider a group G of linear operators
A : X →X
with the unit operator id. In terms of physics, the operators A in G represent phys-
ical quantities independent of any measurement by observers. In order to describe
measurements, we have to assign real numbers to the operator A; these real numbers
are called the coordinates of A. We will proceed in two steps. First we will assign a
matrix A to the operator A. Then we will describe the matrix A = (ajk)j,k=1,...,n
by a family {χjk}j,k=1,...,n of coordinate functions. Moreover, we will pass to the
polynomial algebra generated by the coordinate functions. Finally, this polynomial
algebra can be equipped with the structure of a Hopf algebra.
(i) Matrix elements ajk (Dirac calculus): We set
ajk := ⟨bj|Abk⟩,
j, k = 1, 2, . . . , n
with the corresponding matrix A := (ajk). By matrix calculus (called Dirac
calculus in physics), the map m : L(X, X) →L(Cn, Cn) given by
m(A) := A
for all
A ∈L(X, X)
is an algebra isomorphism. Explicitly, for all linear operators A, B : X →X
and all complex numbers α, β, we have
m(αA + βB) = α · m(A) + β · m(B),
m(AB) = m(A)m(B).
This way, the operator group G is isomorphically transformed into the matrix
group G, which is a subgroup of the group GL(n, C) of invertible complex
(n × n)-matrices with the unit matrix I as unit element.

3.5 Symmetry and Hopf Algebras
151
(ii) Coordinate functions (Hopf algebra – quantum group): Let us make the addi-
tional assumption that det(A) = 1 for all A ∈G. That is, G is a subgroup of
the Lie group SL(n, C). Let A ∈G where A = (ajk). The key deﬁnitions reads
as follows:
χjk(A) := ajk,
j, k = 1, . . . n.
This means that, for ﬁxed indices j, k, the coordinate function χjk : G →C
assigns to each matrix A in the group G its matrix element ajk. Furthermore,
for all j, k = 1, . . . , n and all A, B ∈G, we deﬁne the following:
• Coproduct: (Δχjk)(A, B) := χjk(AB).
• Counit: ε(χjk) := χjk(I).
• Coinverse (Sχjk)(A) := χjk(A−1).
Using the matrix product, we have
 n
X
s=1
χjs ⊗χsk
!
(A, B) =
n
X
s=1
χjs(A)χsk(B) =
n
X
s=1
ajsbsk = χjk(AB).
Thus, for the coproduct we get
Δχjk =
n
X
s=1
χjs ⊗χsk.
Moreover, ε(χjk) = δjk. Since det(A) = 1, the elements of the inverse ma-
trix A−1 are polynomials in the elements of A. Thus, Sχjk is a polynomial
with respect to the functions χ11, . . . , χnn. Let us now introduce the algebra
C[χ11, . . . , χnn] of all polynomials
X
αγ11...γnn(χ11)γ11(χ12)γ12 · · · (χnn)γnn
in the variables χ11, . . . , χnn with complex coeﬃcients α... . Here the exponents
γ11, . . . are nonnegative integers. The operations of this algebra are the usual
complex linear combinations and products. We extend the coproduct Δ above
to the algebra C[χ11, . . . , χnn] by multilinear extension, that is, we deﬁne
Δ
“X
αγ11...γnn(χ11)γ11(χ12)γ12 · · · (χnn)γnn”
by the expression
X
αγ11...γnn(Δχ11)γ11(Δχ12)γ12 · · · (Δχnn)γnn.
Analogous formulas are obtained by replacing Δ by ε (resp. S).
Proposition 3.9 The algebra C[χ11, . . . , χnn] is a commutative Hopf algebra. This
Hopf algebra is cocommutative iﬀthe operator group G is commutative.
For the proof, we refer to Problem 3.11 on page 172. In modern mathematical
physics, one studies deformations of Hopf algebras. In the present case, deforma-
tions of the Hopf algebra C[χ11, . . . , χnn] can be described by deformations of the
coordinate functions χ11, . . . , χnn. The deformation of Hopf algebras is studied in
the theory of quantum groups (see Vol. IV).

3.5.4 The Tannaka–Krein Duality for Compact Lie Groups
Try to dualize in mathematics as much as you can.
Folklore
We want to generalize the classical exponential function
χ(x) := eix,
x ∈R
in the setting of groups and C∗-algebras. The starting point is the functional equa-
tion
χ(x + y) = χ(x)χ(y)
for all
x, y ∈R.
This means that the map χ : R →U(1) is a group morphism from the additive
group R of real numbers onto the multiplicative group U(1) of the unit circle in
the complex plane. Explicitly, U(1) := {z ∈C : |z| = 1}. The group U(1) is the
prototype of a compact Lie group. Our goal is to use the group U(1) in order to
study the structure of more general objects, namely, groups and C∗-algebras. By
deﬁnition, the character of a group G is a group morphism χ : G →U(1), that is,
χ(gh) = χ(g)χ(h)
for all
g, h ∈G.
For example, the characters of the group U(1) are given by the following maps
χn : U(1) →U(1), n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , where
χn(eiϕ) := einϕ,
ϕ ∈R.
(3.47)
In terms of the angle variable ϕ, this corresponds to the map ϕ →nϕ. The integer
n is called the winding number (or the topological charge) of the map χn. In this
connection, let us discuss the following dualities:
• de Rham duality for manifolds and cohomology,
• Pontryagin duality for commutative compact groups,
• Tannaka–Krein duality for noncommutative compact groups,
• Gelfand–Naimark duality for commutative C∗-algebras and noncommutative ge-
ometry (see Vol. IV).
This ﬁts into the following general strategy in mathematics:
Study the structure of a mathematical object X by investigating maps
χ : X →Y
that live on the object X. From the physical point of view, the prototype
for this strategy is given by physical ﬁelds χ that live on the space-time
manifold X.
De Rham duality. Let X be a manifold, and let χ : X →Y be a diﬀerential
form on X. Using the Cartan derivative dχ of the diﬀerential form χ with the crucial
property
d(dχ) = 0,
that is, d2 = 0, the topological properties of the manifold X can be studied by
de Rham cohomology which lies at the heart of modern diﬀerential topology. This
yields a powerful theory of topological invariants (called topological charges in
physics) including the theory of characteristic classes and Chern numbers (see Chap.
5 of Vol. I). Cohomology also lies at the heart of both the methods of BRST-
quantization and algebraic renormalization.

3.5 Symmetry and Hopf Algebras

Pontryagin duality. Let G be a commutative compact topological group24
(e.g., a ﬁnite group or the Lie group U(1)). Let G′ be the group of characters
χ : G →U(1)
of the group G. This so-called dual group G′ of G is always discrete (e.g., for the
group G = U(1), the dual group G′ consists precisely of the maps χn introduced in
(3.47) above, where n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .). Further dualization leads us to the bidual
group G′′ which consists of all the characters
ϱ : G′ →U(1)
of the dual group G′. For each group element g ∈G, we deﬁne
ϱg(χ) := χ(g)
for all
χ ∈G′.
In 1934, Pontryagin proved the following theorem:25
The map g →ϱg is a group isomorphism from G onto the bidual
group G′′.
Tannaka–Krein duality. Let G be a compact Lie group with the unit el-
ement e. We do not assume that G is commutative (e.g., G is one of the groups
U(1), SU(2), SU(3) which arise in the Standard Model of particle physics). We want
to generalize the Pontryagin duality to this more general noncommutative situa-
tion. The trick is to pass from complex numbers to real numbers and to use real
Hopf algebras. The idea is to use the following objects:
• The orginal compact Lie group G.
• The dual real Hopf algebra G′ of all the continuous functions χ : G →R of ﬁnite
type.
• The dual group G′′ to the Hopf algebra G′, which consists of all the algebra
morphisms μ : G′ →R equipped with the convolution product.
Explicitly, we proceed as follows. First consider the real linear space C(G, R) of
continuous real-valued functions
χ : G →R.
(3.48)
For each g ∈G, we deﬁne the function
χg(h) := χ(hg)
for all
h ∈G.
The function χ is called of ﬁnite type iﬀthe linear hull of the set {χg : g ∈G} is
ﬁnite-dimensional. By deﬁnition, the space G′ consists of all the continuous func-
tions (3.48) of ﬁnite type. Obviously, G′ is a linear subspace of C(G, R). Moreover,
deﬁning
Δχ(g, h) := χ(gh),
ε(χ) = χ(e),
Sχ(g) := χ(g−1),
g, h ∈G,
the real linear space G′ becomes a real Hopf algebra. Furthermore, let G′′ denote
the set of all the algebra morphisms m : G′ →R. The set G′′ becomes a group with
respect to the convolution product
24 This means that G is a separated topological space, and the map (g, h) →gh−1
is a continuous map from G × G to G.

where the multiplication map μ sends the tensor product ϕ⊗ψ of functions ϕ, ψ ∈G′
to the product ϕψ. Finally, for each g ∈G, we deﬁne the function ϱg : G′ →R by
setting
ϱg(χ) := χ(g)
for all
χ ∈G′.
Then, ϱg ∈G′′. Tannaka and Krein created a duality theory which culminates in
the following statement:26
The map g →ϱg is a group isomorphism from G onto G′′.
3.6 Regularization and Rota–Baxter Algebras

the Hilbert transform

operating on a suitable function algebra, satisﬁes the identity

Later on, Glen Baxter was the ﬁrst to point out that the evaluation of
several functionals of sums of independent random variables depended on
a purely algebraic study of a closely related identity,
Pf · Pg = P(Pf · g + f · Pg −wfg).
Here, the ﬁxed real parameter w is called the weight of the Rota–Baxter
operator P.27 The very same identity reappeared in the same guise in
various estimates involving the iteration of the maximum function
x →max(x, 0),

such as occur in the theory of almost-everywhere convergence. . . By look-
ing at the problem in the rariﬁed atmosphere of universal algebra, we were
led to a systematic method for guessing and verifying identities for Bax-
ter operators, based upon reducing all computations to identities between
symmetric functions.28
Gian-Carlo Rota and David Smith, 1972
It is our goal to generalize the classical operations of
• diﬀerentiation and integration of smooth functions, and
• regularization of singular functions
by using deformations. This will lead us to the notion of Rota–Baxter operators
with weights. Hopf algebras and Rota–Baxter algebras play a crucial role in modern
renormalization theory, as we will study later on.
Let A be a complex algebra. Consider an operator P : A →A. One frequently
encounters the following special cases.
(i) Linear map: The operator P is called linear iﬀwe have
P(αf + βg) = αPf + βPg
for all f, g ∈A and all complex numbers α, β.
(ii) Antilinear map: The operator P is called antilinear iﬀ
P(αf + βg) = α†Pf + β†Pg
for all f, g ∈A and all complex numbers α, β.
(iii) Multiplicative map: The operator P is called multiplicative iﬀfor all f, g ∈A,
we have the product property
P(fg) = Pf · Pg.
The operator P is called an endomorphism of the algebra A iﬀit is linear and
multiplicative. Bijective endomorphisms are called automorphisms.
(iv) Anti-multiplicative map: The operator P is called anti-multiplicative iﬀfor all
f, g ∈A,
P(fg) = Pg · Pf.
The operator P is called an anti-endomorphism of the algebra A iﬀit is anti-
linear and anti-multiplicative. Bijective anti-endomorphisms are called anti-
automorphisms.
(v) Derivation: The operator P is called a derivation iﬀit is linear, and for all
f, g ∈A, we have the following Leibniz (product) rule:
P(fg) = Pf · g + f · Pg.
(3.49)
Derivations are also called inﬁnitesimal endomorphisms (or generalized diﬀer-
ential operators).

3. The Power of Combinatorics
(vi) Inverse derivation: The operator P is called an inverse derivation iﬀit is linear
and for all f, g ∈A, we have the following rule:
Pf · Pg = P(Pf · g + f · Pg).
(3.50)
As we will show below, this rule generalizes integration by parts. Inverse deriva-
tions are also called generalized integral operators.
(vii) Truncation operator: The operator P is called a truncation iﬀit is linear with
the projector property P 2 = P and with the truncation property, that is, for
all f, g ∈A we have
Pf · Pg = P(Pf · g + f · Pg −fg).
(3.51)
The operator R := I −P is called a regularization operator.
(viii) Rota–Baxter operator: Fix the real number w. The operator P is called a
Rota–Baxter operator of weight w iﬀit is linear and for all f, g ∈A, we have
the relation
Pf · Pg = P(Pf · g + f · Pg −wfg).
(3.52)
Obviously, the inverse derivation (vi) (resp. the truncation operator (vii)) is a
Rota–Baxter operator of weight w = 0 (resp. w = 1). If P is a Rota–Baxter
operator of nonzero weight w, then w−1P (resp. −w−1P) is a Rota–Baxter
operator of weight 1 (resp. −1).
(ix) Rota–Baxter algebra: By deﬁnition, a Rota–Baxter algebra of weight w is a
complex commutative unital algebra A equipped with a ﬁxed Rota–Baxter
operator of weight w.
Diﬀerentiation and integration. Set A := E(R), that is, the complex algebra
A consists of all the smooth functions f : R →C.
• Fix n = 1, 2, . . . The operator
Pf := f n
for all
f ∈A
is multiplicative. This operator is linear iﬀn = 1. In this special case, the operator
P is the trivial automorphism of the algebra A.
• The operator Pf := f † is anti-linear, anti-multiplicative, and bijective. Hence
it is an anti-automorphism of A. (Since f †g† = g†f †, the operator A is also
multiplicative.)
• For ﬁxed real number q, set
(Pf)(x) := f(qx)
for all
x ∈R.
Then the operator P : A →A is an endomorphism.
• The operator Pf := df
dx is a derivation of A. In fact, the Leibniz rule of diﬀeren-
tiation tells us that
d(fg)
dx
= df
dx · g + f · dg
dx.
This is precisely relation (3.49).
• Deﬁne the integral operator (Pf)(x) :=
R x
0 f(u)du for all f ∈A. Choosing
arbitrary functions f, g ∈A, we obtain
P(Pf · g + f · Pg) = Pf · Pg.
This means that the operator P : A →A is a Rota–Baxter operator of weight
w = 0. In fact, setting F(x) :=
R x
0 f(u)du and G(x) :=
R x
0 g(u)du, and noting
that G(0) = F(0) = 0, integration by parts yields

3.6.1 Regularization of the Laurent Series
By a formal Laurent series with ﬁnite principal part, we understand a symbol of
the form
f(z) = a−n
zn + a−n+1
zn−1 + . . . + a−1
z
+ a0 + a1z + a2z2 + . . .
where a−n, a−n+1, . . . are complex numbers and n = 1, 2, . . . The truncation oper-
ator P : A →A is deﬁned by
(Pf)(z) := a−n
zn + a−n+1
zn−1 + . . . + a−1
z .
That is, the truncation operator P assigns the principal part to the Laurent series.
The operator R := I −P is called the regularization operator. Explicitly,
(Rf)(z) := a0 + a1z + a2z2 + . . .
That is, the regularization operator assigns the regular part to the Laurent series.
The set of formal Laurent series with ﬁnite principal part forms a complex commuta-
tive unital algebra with respect to the usual linear combination and multiplication.
For example,
2
„1
z + z
«
+ 3
„ 2
z2 + z2
«
= 2
z + 6
z2 + 2z + 3z2,
and
„2
z + z
« „ 3
z2 + z2
«
= 6
z3 + 3
z + 2z + z3.
Obviously, the truncation operator is linear and a projection operator, that is,
P 2 = P.
Proposition 3.10 The truncation operator P : A →A is a Rota–Baxter operator
of weight w = 1.
Consequently, the algebra of formal Laurent series with ﬁnite principal part is a
Rota–Baxter algebra of weight w = 1 (with respect to the truncation operator P).
Proof. Let f, g ∈A. Since P + R = I, we have
Pf · g + (f · Pg −fg) = Pf · (Pg + Rg) −fRg
= Pf · (Pg + Rg) −(Pf + Rf)Rg = Pf · Pg −Rf · Rg.
Summarizing, Pf · g + f · Pg −fg = Pf · Pg −Rf · Rg. Applying the operator
P to this equation and noting that Rg · Rf is a power series expansion and hence
P(Rg · Rf) = 0, we get the desired relation
P(Pf · g + fPg −fg) = Pf · Pg.

3.6.2 Projection Operators
The preceding result can immediately be generalized to projection operators onto
subalgebras of commutative algebras. This explains the importance of Rota–Baxter
operators for algebraic structures. Let A be a commutative (real or complex) alge-
bra. Suppose that we have the direct sum decomposition
A := A+ ⊕A−
where A+ and A−are subalgebras of A. This means that for each f ∈A we have
the unique sum representation
f = f+ + f−,
f+ ∈A+, f−∈A−.
Now we set Pf := f−and Rf := f+.
Proposition 3.11 The projection operators P : A →A−and R : A →A+ are
Rota–Baxter operators of weight w = 1.
The proof proceeds analogously to the proof of Prop. 3.10.
3.6.3 The q-Integral
Let B be the complex algebra of all polynomials f : R →C with f(0) = 0. Fix the
parameter q ∈] −1, 1[. The Jackson integral (or q-integral) is deﬁned by
(q)
Z x
0
f(x)dx := f(qx) + f(q2x) + f(q3x) + . . . ,
x ∈R.
This series is always convergent. In particular, for k = 1, 2, . . ., we get
(q)
Z x

ukdu = xkqk
1 −qk ,
x ∈R.
Let n = 1, 2, . . . By linearity,
(q)
Z x

(Pf)(x) := (q)
Z x
0
f(u)du,
u ∈R,
f ∈B,
this notion of integral enjoys a formula of integration by parts, namely,
P(Pf · g + f · Pg −wfg) = Pf · Pg
for all
f, g ∈B
(3.53)
with w = −1. This is a deformation of the integration by parts formula
P(Pf · g + f · Pg) = Pf · Pg
for classical integrals (Pf)(x) :=
R x
0 f(u)du.

3.6 Regularization and Rota–Baxter Algebras

Proposition 3.12 The q-integration operator P : B →B is a Rota–Baxter opera-
tor of weight w = −1.
Proof. We have to show that (3.53) is valid. To see this, set (Qf)(x) := f(qx) for
all x ∈R. Then
Pf = Qf + Q2f + Q3f + . . .
Obviously, we have Q(f · g) = Qf · Qg. Hence Q2(f · g) = Q2f · Q2g, and so on.
Let ϕ, ψ ∈B. Using the commutativity property ϕψ = ψϕ, we obtain the following
identity:

3.6.4 The Volterra–Spitzer Exponential Formula
The Volterra exponential formula. Consider the algebra E(R) of smooth func-

(Pf)(t) :=
Z t

t ∈R,
and choose the ﬁxed function a ∈E(R). We will show below that, for all t ∈R, we

(3.57)
The two formulas (3.56) and (3.57) are trivial special cases of the Dyson series
which plays a fundamental role in quantum ﬁeld theory (see Sect. 7.17.4 of Vol. I).
Proof. Let us prove (3.56). We start with the initial-value problem
˙f(t) = a(t)f(t),
t ∈R,
f(0) = 1.
(3.58)
This is equivalent to the Volterra integral equation
f(t) = 1 +
Z t
0
a(u)f(u)du,
t ∈R.
(3.59)
In turn, this is equivalent to the operator equation
f = 1 + P(af).
(3.60)
The initial-value problem (3.56) has the unique solution f(t) = e
R t
0 a(u)du. In fact,
diﬀerentiation yields ˙f(t) = a(t)f(t). Furthermore, if
f = 1 + Pa + Pa ◦Pa + Pa ◦Pa ◦Pa + . . . ,

3.6 Regularization and Rota–Baxter Algebras
161
then 1 + P(af) = 1 + Pa ◦f = f. Thus, f is at least a formal solution of (3.60).
However, the argument from Sect. 7.17.3 of Vol. I shows that the inﬁnite series
f = 1 + Pa + Pa ◦Pa + . . . is uniformly convergent on each compact time interval.
This proves (3.56).
2
The Spitzer exponential formula. It is our goal to solve equation (3.60) in
the case of Rota–Baxter algebras and to generalize the Volterra exponential formula
(3.56) to the following Spitzer exponential formula:29
eP (ln(1−az)−1) = 1 + zPa + z2Pa ◦Pa + z3Pa ◦Pa ◦Pa + . . .
(3.61)
Let A be a Rota–Baxter algebra of weight w = −1 with respect to the Rota–Baxter
operator P : A →A, and let a be a ﬁxed element of A. Then the equation
f = 1 + zP(af),
f ∈A
(3.62)
has a solution given by (3.61). The solution of (3.62) and the Spitzer identity (3.61)
are to be understood in the sense of formal power series expansions with respect to
the variable z. If P is a Rota–Baxter operator of weight w = 1, then the statements
above remain valid if we replace P by −P and a by −a in the Spitzer formula
(3.61). The non-trivial proof can be found in:
F. Spitzer, A combinatorial lemma and its application to probability the-
ory, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 82 (1965), 323–339.

beginning in 1967.
Folklore
3.7.1 Incidence Algebras and the Zeta Function
Let P be a partially ordered set. We deﬁne the closed interval
[x, z] := {y ∈P : x ≤y ≤z},
and the half-open interval
[x, z[:= {y ∈P : x ≤y < z}.
The set P is called locally ﬁnite iﬀeach closed interval only contains a ﬁnite number
of elements. The function
ζ(x, y) :=
(
1
if
x ≤y,
0
otherwise
is called the zeta function of P, and the function
δ(x, y) :=
(
1
if
x = y,
0
otherwise
is called the Kronecker function of P. In terms of physics, we may regard the
elements x, y, . . . of P as events. The relation x ≤y means that the event y is
caused by the event x.
Let P be a locally ﬁnite partially ordered set. By deﬁnition, the set A(P)
consists of all the functions
f : P × P →R
with f(x, y) = 0 if x ̸≤y. For f, g ∈A(P), we deﬁne the convolution
(f ∗g)(x, z) :=
X
x≤y≤z
f(x, y)g(y, z).
Obviously, f ∗δ = δ ∗f = f.
The set A(P) is a real associative unital algebra with the convolution as
product and the Kronecker function as unit element.
The algebra A(P) is called the incidence algebra of P. We have to prove the asso-
ciative law for the convolution. In fact, ((f ∗g) ∗h)(x, z) is equal to
X
x≤y≤z
(f ∗g)(x, y)h(y, z) =

3.7.2 The M¨obius Function as an Inverse Function
Proposition 3.13 There exists precisely one function μ ∈A(P) which is a two-
sided inverse of the zeta function, that is, μ ∗ζ = ζ ∗μ = δ.
Proof. (I) Uniqueness. If μ′ ∗ζ = ζ ∗μ′ = δ, then the associative law states
μ = μ ∗δ = μ ∗(ζ ∗μ′) = (μ ∗ζ) ∗μ′ = δ ∗μ′ = μ′.
(II) Existence. If x ̸≤z, then let μ(x, z) := 0. If x ≤z, then we set μ(x, x) := 1,
and we use
μ(x, z) := −
X
x≤y<z
μ(x, y)
(3.63)
as the basis for an inductive deﬁnition over the number of elements contained in
the interval [x, z]. For example, if [x, z] contains precisely two elements, then
μ(x, z) = −μ(x, x) = −1.
If [x, z] contains precisely the three elements x, y, z, then x < y < z. Hence
μ(x, z) = −μ(x, x) −μ(x, y) = −1 + 1 = 0.
Finally, let us prove the convolution formula
X
x≤y≤z
ζ(x, y)μ(y, z) = δ(x, z).
In fact, if z = x, then 1 = ζ(x, x)μ(x) = δ(x, x). If x < z, then the deﬁnition of the
M¨obius function μ states
X
x≤y<z
ζ(x, y)μ(y, z) + μ(x, z) = 0.
This is the claim, since ζ(x, z) = 1 and δ(x, z) = 0.
2
The M¨obius inversion formula. The following inversion formula represents
the main property of the M¨obius function.
Proposition 3.14 Let f : P →R be a function on the locally ﬁnite partially
ordered set P. Suppose that there exists an element x0 in P such that f(x) = 0 if
x0 ̸≤x. Deﬁne F(x) := P
y≤x f(y). Then
f(x) =
X
y≤x
F(y)μ(y, x)
for all
x ∈P.
(3.64)
Proof. Since F(x) = P
x0≤y≤x f(y), the sum F(x) is ﬁnite. By substitution,
X
y≤x
F(y)μ(y, x) =
X
y≤x
X
z≤y
f(z)μ(y, x).
This is equal to P
y≤x
P

Prop. 3.13 tells us that this is equal to

ζ(z, y)μ(y, x) =

3. The Power of Combinatorics
This identity proves the validity of the inversion formula (3.64).
2
The discrete version of the fundamental theorem of calculus. Consider
the continuous function f : R →R. Set
F(x) :=
Z x
0
f(y)dy
for all
x ∈R.
Then the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that
f(x) = F ′(x)
for all
x ∈R.
For an arbitrary function f : {1, 2, . . .} →R, the discrete version reads as
F(n) :=
X
1≤m≤n
f(m)
and
f(n) = F(n) −F(n −1),
n = 2, 3, . . . ,
f(1) = F(1).
(3.65)
The proof is obvious. In order to see that this is a special case of the M¨obius inversion
formula, consider the set P of positive integers. This is a partially ordered set
equipped with the usual ≤-relation. The corresponding M¨obius function is deﬁned
by μ(m, n) := 0 if m > n. Moreover, μ(m, m) := 1. For n = m + 1, m + 2, . . ., we
successively have
μ(m, n) := −
X
m≤k<n
μ(m, k).
Hence μ(m, m + 1) = −μ(m, m) = −1. This implies
μ(m, m + 2) = −μ(m, m) −μ(m, m + 1) = −1 + 1 = 0.
Furthermore, μ(m, m+3) = −μ(m, m)−μ(m, m+1)−μ(m, m+2) = −1+1+0 = 0.
Similarly, we get μ(m, m) := 1, μ(m, m + 1) = −1, and otherwise μ(m, n) = 0. For
the zeta function of P, we get ζ(m, n) = 1 if m ≤n and otherwise ζ(m, n) = 0.
Therefore,
F(n) =
X
1≤m≤n
f(m)ζ(m, n).
By Prop. 3.14, f(n) = P
1≤m≤n F(m)μ(m, n). This coincides with (3.65).
In what follows, we will apply the M¨obius inversion formula to the inclusion-
exclusion principle in combinatorics, to the classical 1832 M¨obius inversion formula
in number theory, and to the Riemann zeta function.
3.7.3 The Inclusion–Exclusion Principle in Combinatorics
Let S1 and S2 be ﬁnite sets, and let |Sj| denote the cardinality of the set Sj (i.e.,
the number of elements). Then
|S1 ∪S2| = |S1| + |S2| −|S1 ∩S2|.
This is the simplest case of the so-called inclusion-exclusion principle. In general,
this principle states that the cardinality of the union of a ﬁnite family of ﬁnite sets
can be computed as an alternating sum of cardinalities of intersections of those
sets. Explicitly, let n = 2, 3, . . . If S1, . . . Sn are ﬁnite sets, then

|Si1 ∩· · · ∩Sin|.
(3.66)
Proof. We will use the M¨obius inversion formula. To this end, let P be the collection
of all the ﬁnite subsets of the set
E := {S1, S2, . . . , Sn},
including the empty subset. For example, ∅, {S1}, {S1, S2}, . . . , {S1, . . . , Sn} are
elements of the set P, which becomes a partially ordered set with respect to the
usual ⊆-relation. For A, B ∈P, the M¨obius function of P reads as
μ(A, B) = (−1)|B\A|
if A ⊆B. Otherwise μ(A, B) = 0. Set S := S1 ∪· · · ∪Sn. For each element A of P
diﬀerent from ∅, deﬁne f(A) as the cardinality of the set
{x ∈S : x ∈Sj iﬀSj ∈A}.
Furthermore, set f(∅) := 0. For example, if A = {S1}, then
f(A) = |S1 \ {S2 ∪· · · ∪Sn}|.
Now introduce the function
F(A) :=
X
A⊆B
f(B).
For example, if E := {S1, S2} and A := ∅, then
F(∅) = 0 + |S1 \ S2| + |S2 \ S1| + |S1 ∩S2| = |S1 ∪S2|.
The summands correspond to B = ∅, {S1}, {S2}, {S1, S2}. If A is equal to {S1},
then
F(A) = |S1 \ S2| + |S1 ∩S2| = |S1|.
If A = {S1, S2}, then F(A) = |S1 ∪S2|. In the general case where n = 1, 2, . . ., we
get F(∅) = |S|. Moreover, if A is diﬀerent from ∅, then
F(A) =
\
Sj∈A
Sj.
By M¨obius inversion, f(A) = P
A⊆B F(B)μ(A, B). Using A = ∅, we obtain
f(∅) = F(∅) +
X
B̸=∅
(−1)|B|F(B).
Since f(∅) = 0, F(∅) = |S| and F(B) = | T
Sj∈B Sj|, this is the claim.

3. The Power of Combinatorics
3.7.4 Applications to Number Theory
The classical M¨obius function. A positive integer n is called a prime number
iﬀn ≥2, and only the numbers 1 and n are divisors of n. Each positive integer
n ≥2 can be uniquely represented as
n = pα1
1 pα2
2 · · · pαr
r
where p1 < p2 < . . . < pr are prime numbers and α1, α2, . . . , αr are positive
integers. Let n = 2, 3 . . . By deﬁnition,
μ(n) := (−1)r
if α1 = α2 = . . . = αr = 1.
Otherwise μ(n) := 0. Furthermore, μ(1) := 1. For example, if p is a prime number,
then μ(p) = −1. If n = pq is the product of two diﬀerent prime numbers p and q,
then μ(pq) = 1. Moreover, if n is divisible by a square of a prime number, then
μ(n) = 0. For example μ(12) = 0. Let P := {1, 2, . . .}. For m, n ∈P, we write
m ⪯n
iﬀm is a divisor of n. This way, P becomes a partially ordered set which is locally
ﬁnite. For given function f : P →R, we deﬁne
F(n) :=
X
m⪯n
f(m),
n = 1, 2, . . .
In 1832, M¨obius (1790–1868) discovered the inversion formula
f(n) =

,
n = 1, 2, . . .
(3.67)
The relation to partially ordered sets. Formula (3.67) is a special case of
the M¨obius inversion formula (3.64) (due to Rota) on P = {1, 2, . . .} with respect
to ⪯. This follows from the formula
μ(m, n) = μ
“ n
m
”
(3.68)
for all m, n ∈P with m ⪯n. The proof of (3.68) will be given in Problem 3.15. For
the zeta function on P, we get ζ(m, n) := 1 if m ⪯n. Otherwise ζ(m, n) = 0.
The inverse of the Riemann zeta function. If s is a complex number with
ℜ(s) > 1, then the Riemann zeta function is given by
ζ(s) =

ζ(1, n)

.
For the inverse function, we obtain

3.6 The coinverse of a diﬀerential operator. Prove (3.13) on page 127.
Solution: Consider ﬁrst D := ∂k∂j. By (3.8) on page 125, the Sweedler notation
ΔD = P
D D(1) ⊗D(2) corresponds to
Δ(∂k∂j) = ∂k∂j ⊗1 + ∂j ⊗∂k + ∂k ⊗∂j + 1 ⊗∂k∂j.

S(D(1)) ⊗D(2) = S(∂k∂j) ⊗1 + S(∂j) ⊗∂k + S(∂k) ⊗∂j + S(1) ⊗∂k∂j

3.7 Properties of the convolution. Prove Proposition 3.5 on page 130. Solution:
(I) Associativity. By deﬁnition of the convolution,
(B ∗C) ∗D = μ((B ∗C) ⊗D)Δ = μ(μ ⊗id)(B ⊗C ⊗D)(Δ ⊗id)Δ.
By coassociativity, (Δ ⊗id)Δ = (id ⊗Δ)Δ. Finally, the associativity of the
multiplication on A tells us that (B ∗C) ∗D is equal to
μ(id ⊗μ)(B ⊗C ⊗D))(id ⊗Δ)Δ = μ(B ⊗(C ∗D))Δ = B ∗(C ∗D).
(II) Unit element. By deﬁnition of the convolution, B ∗ηε = μ(B ⊗ηε)Δ. This
can be written as
B ∗ηε = μ(id ⊗η)(B ⊗idC)(id ⊗ε)Δ.
By unitality, μ(id⊗η)(B⊗idC) = B. Moreover, counitality yields (id⊗ε)Δ = id.
Hence B ∗ηε = B. Similarly, we get ηε ∗B = B.
3.8 Uniqueness of the coinverse. Show that the coinverse of a Hopf algebra is
unique. Solution: Suppose that
id ∗S = S ∗id = ηε,
and id ∗S′ = S′ ∗id = ηε. By Prop. 3.5 on page 130,
S′ ∗(id ∗S) = S′ ∗ηε = S′.
Similarly, (S′ ∗id)∗S = ηε∗S = S. By associativity of the convolution, S′ = S.
3.9 Anti-multiplicativity of the coinverse. Show that the coinverse S : A →A of a
Hopf algebra A is an algebra anti-morphism, that is, S is linear and we have
S(ab) = S(b)S(a) for all a, b ∈A.

3.10 Hopf algebras and ﬁnite groups. Prove Proposition 3.8 on page 148.
Solution: Set A := H(G). For given functions ϕ, ψ ∈A, the tensor product
ϕ ⊗ψ denotes a function of two variables given by
(ϕ ⊗ψ)(g, h) := ϕ(g)ψ(h)
for all
g, h ∈G.

Problems

The tensor algebra A ⊗A consists of all the ﬁnite sums
ϕ1 ⊗ψ1 + ... + ϕn ⊗ψn,
ϕj, ψj ∈A,
j = 1, ..., n, n = 1, 2, ...
Since the group G is ﬁnite, the tensor algebra A ⊗A contains precisely all
complex functions ϕ : G×G →C of two variables, ϕ = ϕ(g, h), where g, h ∈G.
Similarly, A ⊗A ⊗A consists of all complex functions χ : G × G × G →C
of three variables, χ = χ(g, h, k), where g, h, k ∈G. For all ϕ, ψ ∈A and all
z ∈C, we set
μ(ϕ ⊗ψ) := ϕψ,
η(z) := z1,
id(ϕ) := ϕ.
We have to show the following:
(CA) (id ⊗Δ)Δ = (Δ ⊗id)Δ (coassociativity).
(CU) (ε ⊗id)Δ = (id ⊗ε)Δ = id (counitality).
(S) μ(S ⊗id)Δ = μ(id ⊗S)Δ = ηε (coinverse).
These properties follow easily from the corresponding deﬁnitions of the maps
Δ, ε, and S on page 148. Let us show this. In what follows, the symbols g, h, k, m
are elements of the group G. The map Δ sends A to A ⊗A, that is, functions
of one variable are transformed into functions of two variables. Explicitly, let
ψ := Δϕ,
ϕ ∈A.
Then ψ(g, h) = ϕ(gh). If τ ∈A ⊗A, then the function σ := μτ is given by
σ(g) = τ(g, g)
for all
g ∈G.
This follows from τ = P
jk αjkχj ⊗χk and σ = P
jk αjkχjχk (see (3.46) on
page 149).
Ad (CA). We will use g(hk) = (gh)k. The map id⊗Δ sends A⊗A to A⊗A⊗A.
Let χ := (id ⊗Δ)ψ. Then
χ(g, h, k) = ψ(g, hk) = ϕ(g(hk)).
Similarly, let ϱ := (Δ ⊗id)ψ. Then
ϱ(g, h, k) = ψ(gh, k) = ϕ((gh)k).
Therefore, χ = ϱ.
Ad (CU). We will use eg = ge = g. Let α := (ε ⊗id)ψ. Then
α(g) = ψ(e, g) = ϕ(eg).
Similarly, setting β := (id ⊗ε)ψ, we get
β(g) = ψ(g, e) = ϕ(ge).
Consequently, α = β.
Ad (S). We will use g−1g = gg−1 = e. Let σ := μτ with τ := (S ⊗id)ψ. Then
σ(g) = τ(g, g) = ψ(g−1, g) = ϕ(g−1g) = ϕ(e).
Similarly, setting ν := μλ with λ := (id ⊗S)ψ, we obtain
ν(g) = λ(g, g) = ψ(g, g−1) = ϕ(gg−1) = ϕ(e).
Finally, let α := ηβ and β := ε(ϕ). Then β(g) = ϕ(e) and α(g) = ϕ(e).
Therefore, σ = ν = ηε.

Hint: Argue similarly to the solution of Problem 3.10.
3.12 Proof of the Lagrange inversion formulas. Prove the formulas (3.22) and (3.23)

Here, we brieﬂy write u instead of u(τ, e).
(I) n = 1. Diﬀerentiating the Lagrange equation
u(τ, e) = τ + eϕ(u(τ, e))
(3.79)
with respect to the variables τ and e, we get
uτ = 1 + eϕ′(u)uτ,
ue = ϕ(u) + eϕ′(u)ue.
Multiplying this by ue and uτ, respectively, we get ue = ϕ(u)uτ. This is the
claim (3.78) with n = 1.
(II) n ⇒n + 1. If the function F is smooth, then the chain rule tells us that

to the variable e and noting (3.80), we get

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in
Mathematics
Quantum states are equivalence classes. Global physical ﬁelds are sections
of bundles.
Folklore
One of the main strategies in the sciences consists in using classiﬁcations. This
means that we put single objects into classes. Instead of studying individual ob-
jects, we investigate the properties of classes. This is a simple, but extremely pow-
erful general strategy. For example, the ﬁrst systematic classiﬁcation of plants and
animals was developed by the Swedish biologist Carl von Linn´e (1707–1778). Baron
de la Br`ede et de Montesquieu (1689–1755) said:
Intelligence consists of this; that we recognize the similarity of diﬀerent
things and the diﬀerence between similar ones.
In terms of mathematics, this corresponds to introducing operations for equivalence
classes. In this series of monographs, we will study the following topics:
(I) Simplifying mathematical theories or justifying formal approaches by introduc-
ing ideal elements:
• imaginary numbers (solution of algebraic equations, theory of analytic func-
tions, Fourier transform, quantum theory, conformal ﬁeld theory, string the-
ory),
• inﬁnite points in projective geometry (e.g., the compactiﬁcation of algebraic
curves, compact Riemann surfaces, elliptic and Abelian integrals),
• generalized derivatives and distributions (e.g., the Dirac delta function),
• Mikusi´nski’s superfunctions (or operators) in electrical engineering (justiﬁ-
cation of the Heaviside calculus),
• Sato’s hyperfunctions (generalized analytic functions, applications to partial
diﬀerential equations),
• cardinal and ordinal numbers, transﬁnite induction (Cantor’s structuring of
the inﬁnite),
• justiﬁcation of Leibniz’s inﬁnitesimals in non-standard analysis via ultra-
ﬁlters.
(II) Equivalence classes in algebra:
• the Gaussian ring of integers modulo a ﬁxed integer, and the quadratic reci-
procity law in number theory,
• the Gaussian ring, the Fermat–Euler theorem, and a modern coding algo-
rithm,
• the construction of algebraic objects that satisfy prescribed relations (e.g.,
complex numbers, quaternions, octions, tensor algebras, Grassmann alge-
bras, Cliﬀord algebras, universal envelopping algebra of a Lie algebra, su-
persymmetric algebras, and quantum groups),
• quotient structures (e.g., quotien groups, quotient rings, quotient algebras,
quotient ﬁelds),

176
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
• the quotient ﬁeld over the convolution ring of continuous functions (Miku-
si´nski’s rigorous approach to the Heaviside calculus in electrical engineering),
• ﬁeld extensions (e.g., algebraic equations and Galois theory, algebraic num-
bers, rational functions),
• central extensions of groups and Lie algebras (Bargmann’s theorem on the
projective representations of the Poincar´e group, the Virasoro algebra and
conformal quantum ﬁeld theory),
• exact sequences, chain complexes, homology groups, and homological alge-
bra,
• the cohomology of groups or Lie algebras,
• direct (resp. codirect) limits of sets, linear spaces, groups, function spaces,
spaces of generalized functions (distributions), and topological spaces (e.g.,
ˆCech cohomology),1
• the strategy of generalized physical ﬁelds (ﬁber bundles, sheaves, Grothen-
dieck’s schemes in algebraic geometry, algebraic K-theory),
• the strategy of coordinatization (duality, Hopf algebras, quantum groups),
• the strategy of motives in number theory,
• categories and functors as a general tool in order to describe mathematical
structures.
(III) Equivalence classes in analysis:
• Cantor’s construction of real numbers as equivalence classes of Cauchy se-
quences, the completion of metric spaces, and Hensel’s p-adic numbers,
• completion of a normed space to a Banach space: the Lebesgue integral,
Sobolev spaces and the energetic approach to both the partial diﬀerential
equations of mathematical physics and the calculus of variations (e.g., the
justiﬁcation of the Dirichlet principle in electrostatics),
• the completion of a pre-Hilbert space and the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal
(GNS) construction for C∗-algebras in the algebraic approach to quantum
theory.
• The Riemann–Hilbert problem and the Birkhoﬀdecomposition (the Connes–
Kreimer approach to renormalization and renormalization groups, the uni-
versal Connes–Kreimer–Moscovici Hopf algebra),
• the motivic Galois group in renormalization group theory due to Connes and
Marcolli.
(IV) Equivalence classes in geometry:
• homogeneous spaces and transformation groups (orbit spaces and orbit types
in gauge ﬁeld theory),
• spaces of quantum states and projective geometry (e.g., the Hopf ﬁbration
and the electron spin),
• curvature and ﬁber bundles (the Standard Model in elementary particle
physics),
• universal covering of a Lie group (e.g., the electron spin),
• universal covering of a Riemann surface; scattering of strings; global parame-
trization (uniformization) of Riemann surfaces and algebraic varieties, alge-
braic functions and Abelian integrals, Riemann’s moduli space of Riemann
surfaces,
• the Teichm¨uller space as a universal covering of Riemann’s moduli space,
• Riemann’s holonomy group of a diﬀerential equation (diﬀerential equations
of Fuchsian type and special functions like Gauss’ hypergeometric function),
1 Direct and codirect limits are also called inductive and projective limits, respec-
tively.

• holonomy group of a principal ﬁber bundle (the Ashtekar approach to quan-
tum gravitation),
• lattices as quotient groups and special functions (periodic functions, elliptic
functions, automorphic functions, modular functions, theta functions, Jacobi
varieties),
• sheaf theory, cohomology with values in a sheaf, and the global construction
of analytic functions and diﬀerentials, divisors and line bundles (the Cousin
problems, Abelian integrals, the Riemann–Roch–Hirzebruch theorem),
• sheaves and Grothendieck’s schemes in algebraic geometry and number the-
ory (e.g., local rings, divisors),
• K-theory of operator algebras (noncommutative geometry and quantum ﬁeld
theory).
• Quantization of gauge theories via the Faddeev–Popov method (pseudo-
measure on the orbit space induced by the gauge group, factorization of
the Feynman functional integral, ghosts).
(V) Equivalence classes in topology:
• bundles and cocycles (physical ﬁelds and observers),
• topological quotient spaces (e.g., the topology of projective spaces or the
spectrum of a quantum operator as the space of maximal ideals in the
Gelfand theory of C∗-algebras),
• fundamental group and higher homotopy groups of a topological space,
• homology groups of a topological space (e.g., the Lefschetz ﬁxed-point the-
orem),
• cohomology groups of a topological space (e.g., electrical circuits, topolog-
ical charges of physical ﬁelds, de Rham cohomology, characteristic classes,
Chern class, Thom class, Stiefel–Whitney class, existence of the 4-potential
in Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism),
• dynamical systems and Floer homology (generalized Morse theory),
• dynamical systems and the Conley index as the homotopy type of a topo-
logical space (generalized Morse theory),
• Grothendieck’s algebraic K-theory and the Riemann–Roch–Hirzebruch the-
orem,
• the Atiyah–Hirzebruch topological K-theory (generalized cohomology) of
topological spaces (index of Fredholm operators, Atiyah–Singer index theo-
rem, homotopy groups of the space of Fredholm operators of a Hilbert space,
vector ﬁelds on spheres, string theory),
• Frobenius manifolds, moduli spaces, and quantum cohomology.
This impressive list of deep tools in mathematics and its relations to physics shows
that:
Equivalence classes are everywhere in mathematics and physics.
The reader should note the following. One of the most important tools in modern
mathematics are bundles, which globalize classical notions like linear spaces, Lie
groups, and so on. We want to show that:
Bundles in mathematics are closely related to physical ﬁelds.
This helps to understand many deep relations between modern mathematics and
modern physics.

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
Here, A denotes an index set (e.g., A := {1, 2, . . . , N}). For two elements x and y,
we write
x ∼y
iﬀthere exists an index α such that x, y ∈Xα. Obviously, for all x, y, z ∈X, the
following hold:
(R) Reﬂexivity: x ∼x.
(S) Symmetry: if x ∼y, then y ∼x.
(T) Transitivity: if x ∼y and y ∼z, then x ∼z (transitivity).
Equivalence relation. We are given the set X. Suppose that, for certain
elements x and y of X, there exists a relation x ∼y which has the properties
(R), (S), and (T) above. Then the relation ’∼’ is called an equivalence relation.
Introduce the equivalence class [x] of the element x by setting
[x] := {y ∈X :
x ∼y}.
The elements of [x] are called the representatives of the equivalence class.
Proposition 4.1 The equivalence classes yield a partition of the set X into pair-
wise disjoint subsets [x].
The set of these equivalence classes is denoted by the symbol
X/ ∼:= { [x] :
x ∈X}.
This set is called the quotient space with respect to the equivalence relation ’∼’.
Proof. If z ∈[x] and z ∈[y], then x ∼z, y ∼z. Hence x ∼y, by symmetry and
transitivity. This implies [x] = [y]. Conversely, if [x] = [y], then x ∼y. Thus, either
two equivalence classes coincide or they are disjoint.

We will show on page 199 that quantum states are equivalence classes.
4.1 Equivalence Classes in Algebra
Let us discuss the basic ideas about quotient structures in algebra.
4.1.1 The Gaussian Quotient Ring and the Quadratic Reciprocity
Law in Number Theory
Gauss is supposed to have discovered a proof of the law of quadratic reci-
procity in 1796 when he was nineteen. . . This law, which Gauss called the
gem of arithmetic, is a basic result on congruences. After Gauss gave his
six proofs, more than ﬁfty others were given by later mathematicians.2.

The ring Z of integers. Let R denote the set Z of integers 0, ±1, ±2, . . . Then,
for all a, b, c ∈R, the following hold:
(R0) Consistency: a + b, ab ∈R.

University Press, 1990.

4.1 Equivalence Classes in Algebra

(R1) Additivity: R is an additive group.3
(R2) Distributivity: (a + b)c = ac + bc and c(a + b) = ca + cb.
(R3) Associativity: (ab)c = a(bc).
(R4) Commutativity: ab = ba.
(R5) Unitality: There exists an element 1 (called the unit element of R) such that
1a = a1 = a for all a ∈R.
A set R is called a ring iﬀthere exist an addition a+b and a multiplication ab for all
a, b ∈R such that the properties (R0)–(R3) are satisﬁed. If, in addition, property
(R4) is also met, then the ring is called commutative. Using this terminology, the
ring Z of integers is a commutative ring with unit element 1.
• A ring R with unit element 1 is called a skew-ﬁeld iﬀ, for any given nonzero
element a, there exists an element in R denoted by a−1 such that we have the
relation4 aa−1 = a−1a = 1.
• A commutative skew-ﬁeld is called a ﬁeld.5
For example, the sets Q (rational numbers), R (real numbers), C (complex numbers)
are ﬁelds, whereas the set H of quaternions is only a skew-ﬁeld.6
A subset S of the ring R is called a subring iﬀit is a ring with respect to the
operations on R. By deﬁnition, a two-sided ideal S of a ring R is a subring with
sr ∈R
and
rs ∈R
for all
s ∈S, r ∈R.
In a commutative ring, two-sided ideals are brieﬂy called ideals.7 For a ﬁxed integer
m, we set
mZ := {mk :
k ∈Z}.
Obviously, mZ is an ideal of Z. We call this the ideal generated by the integer m.
We also brieﬂy write (m) instead of mZ.
By a ring morphism, we understand a map
χ : R →T
(4.1)
between the rings R and T which respects addition and multiplication, that is, for
all a, b ∈R, we have
χ(a + b) = χ(a) + χ(b),
χ(ab) = χ(a)χ(b).
(4.2)
If R and T are ﬁelds, then the map (4.1) is called a ﬁeld morphism iﬀ(4.2) holds.
Bijective ﬁeld morphisms are called ﬁeld isomorphisms. Analogously, we deﬁne mor-
phisms and isomorphisms for skew-ﬁelds.
3 See Sect. 7.5 of Vol. I.
4 One easily shows that this inverse element a−1 is uniquely determined by a, and
the nonzero elements of R form a group. A ring with unit element is also called
a unital ring.
5 For skew-ﬁelds and ﬁelds, we always exclude the trivial case {0}, that is, we
assume that there exist two diﬀerent elements, namely, the zero element 0 and
the unit element 1.
6 A quaternion is given by ai + bj + ck + d where a, b, c, d are real numbers, and
i2 = j2 = k2 = −1, as well as ij = −ji = k, jk = −kj = i, ki = −ik = j.
7 Ideals were introduced by Kummer (1810–1893) in order to prove a special case of
Fermat’s last theorem in number theory. The ﬁnal proof of Fermat’s last theorem
was given by Wiles (born 1953) in 1994. Important contributions to the theory of
ideals were made by Dedekind (1831–1916), as well as by von Neumann (1903–
1957) and by Gelfand (born 1913) in the context of operator theory related to
quantum mechanics (von Neumann algebras and Gelfand’s C∗-algebras).

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
The Gaussian ring Z/mod m of residue classes modulo m. Choose a ﬁxed
integer m. Let x, y ∈Z. Following Gauss we write
x ≡y
mod m
iﬀ
x −y ∈(m).
This is an equivalence relation (also called congruence relation). The equivalence
classes are denoted by [x]. They are also called residue classes. In other words, x is
congruent to y modulo m iﬀthe diﬀerence x −y is divisible by the integer m. For
example, if m = 3, then 2 ≡5 mod 3, and there are precisely three equivalence
classes [0], [1], [2], namely,
[0] = (m),
[1] = 1 + (m) = {1, 1 ± 3, 1 ± 6, 1 ± 9 . . .},
[2] = 2 + (m).
In particular, the representatives of [2] are 2, 5, 8, . . . , −1, −4, −7 . . . Addition and
multiplication of residue classes are deﬁned by
[x] + [y] := [x + y],
[x][y] = [xy].
This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the representatives.8 For example, if
m = 2, then [2]+[1] = [3] = [1], and [2] = [4], [1] = [7], as well as [4]+[7] = [11] = [1].
The operations for the two elements of Z/mod 2 are given by
[1] + [1] = [0],
[0] + [1] = [1] + [0] = [1],
[0] + [0] = [0],
(4.3)
and [0][1] = [1][0] = [0] and [1][1] = [1]. Thus, Z/mod 2 is a ﬁeld (also brieﬂy
denoted by Z2). The same result can be obtained by computing with integers and
by setting ’2 = 0’. For example,
5 + 8 = 13 = 1 + 6 · 2 = 1,
5 · 8 = 40 = 20 · 2 = 0.
This corresponds to [5] + [8] = [13] = [1] and [5][8] = [40] = [0]. In the following
proposition, assume that m = 1, 2, 3, . . . .
Proposition 4.2 (i) The quotient space Z/mod m is a commutative ring with the
unit element [1].
(ii) The quotient ring Z/mod m is a ﬁeld iﬀm is a prime number.
(iii) The order of a ﬁnite ﬁeld is a prime power.
(iv) Conversely, for any given prime power pn, there is a unique ﬁnite ﬁeld of
order pn (up to isomorphism).
(v) Each ﬁnite skew-ﬁeld is a ﬁeld.
Finite ﬁelds are also called Galois ﬁelds. The proofs can be found in the standard
textbooks on algebra. We refer to:
B. van der Waerden, Moderne Algebra, Vols. 1, 2, Springer, Berlin, 1930,
8th edition, 1993 (in German). English edition: Modern Algebra, Frederyck
Ungar, New York, 1975.
S. Lang, Algebra, Springer, New York, 2002.
8 This follows from the fact that the equivalence relation respects addition and
multiplication. That is, if x ≡y mod m and u ≡v mod m, then
x + u ≡y + v
mod m
and
xu ≡yv
mod m.

4.1 Equivalence Classes in Algebra

In the literature, one also writes Zm instead of Z/mod m. For example, the ad-
ditive group Z2 from (4.3) is isomorphic to the multiplicative group {1, −1}. The
isomorphism is given by
[0] →1,
[1] →−1.
The quadratic reciprocity law in number theory. In 1801, the young
Gauss (1777–1855) published his Disquisitiones arithmeticae (investigations on
arithmetic). This work founded modern number theory. In particular, Gauss proved
the following so-called quadratic reciprocity law. This law was empirically discov-
ered by Euler (1707–1783) and by Legendre (1752–1833). Gauss gave the ﬁrst com-
plete proof. The goal is to study the quadratic equation
x2 ≡q
mod p
(4.4)
and its dual equation x2 ≡p mod q. If equation (4.4) has a solution, then we set
“
q
p
”
:= 1. Otherwise,
“
q
p
”
:= −1. This is called the Legendre symbol.
Theorem 4.3 If p and q are prime numbers greater than two, then
„q
p
«
= (−1)(p−1)(q−1)/4
„p
q
«
.
In addition,
“
p−1
p
”
= (−1)(p−1)/2 and
“
2
p
”
= (−1)(p2−1)/8.
Example. The equation
x2 ≡4
mod 5
has a solution, namely, x = 2. The equation
x2 ≡2
mod 3
has no solution. In fact, if x = 0, 1, 2, then x2 ≡a mod 3 with a = 0, 1, 1. Using
the quadratic reciprocity law, we have
` 4
5
´
= 1 and
` 2
3
´
= −1.

4.1.2 Application of the Fermat–Euler Theorem in Coding Theory
More than 200 years the theorem of Fermat–Euler was considered to be only a result
in pure mathematics. In 1977 however, Rivest, Shamir and Adleman published a
baﬄingly simple and yet extraordinarily secure code, which is based on the Fermat–
Euler theorem.
The Euler function. The positive integers k and m are called relatively prime
iﬀ1 is the only common divisor. For example, 3 and 5 are relatively prime, but 2
and 4 are not. Let m = 1, 2, . . . The Euler number ϕ(m) tells us how many of the
numbers 1, 2, . . . , m are relatively prime to m. For example, 1, 3 are relatively prime
to 4, but 2, 4 are not. Hence ϕ(4) = 2. Furthermore,
ϕ(1) = ϕ(2) = 1, ϕ(3) = 2, ϕ(5) = 4, ϕ(6) = 2.
If m is a prime number, then ϕ(m) = m −1. Alternatively, ϕ(m) is equal to the
invertible elements of the ring Z/mod m. The function ϕ : N× →N× is called the
Euler function.
The Fermat–Euler theorem. This theorem due to Fermat (1601–1665) and
Euler (1707–1783) tells us the following:
For positive integers a and m, which are assumed to be relatively prime,
one has aϕ(m) ≡1 mod m.
Fermat formulated this theorem in the special case where m is a prime number.
Then ϕ(m) = m −1. For example, 24 ≡1 mod 5. Let us brieﬂy discuss the
application of this theorem to the following sophisticated coding method.
Preparations by the operator. Step 1: Here two prime numbers p and q,
roughly of the size 10100, are chosen and kept secrete.
Step 2: One forms the product m = pq and calculates ϕ(m) = (p −1)(q −1).
Step 3: One chooses an additional positive integer s with 0 < s < ϕ(m).
Step 4: The person sending the message is given publicly the two numbers m
and s.
Encoding the message. The message is simply encoded in a single positive
integer n.9 The person sending the message computes the number r by the following
equation
ns ≡r
mod m.
The number r is the only information sent to the operator.
Decoding the message by the operator. Here one must reconstruct from
the remainder r the original number n. The operator proceeds as follows.
Step 1: He uses the two numbers m and s in order to compute a positive integer
t which satisﬁes the equation
9 For example, one associates to every letter a two-digit number 10, 11, 12, . . . and
replaces in the message all occurrences of the letter by that two-digit number.
Then forming the concatenation of all of these, one gets a big number n.

4.1 Equivalence Classes in Algebra
183
ts ≡1
mod ϕ(m).
(4.5)
This equation always has a solution, since ϕ(m) and s are relatively prime.
Step 2: He now just divides rt by the number m. The remainder is the sought
for number n which allows the operator to decode the message.
Justiﬁcation of the procedure. The following fact is the key to this proce-
dure.
Proposition 4.4 rt ≡n mod m.
Proof. By the Fermat–Euler theorem, one has
nϕ(m) ≡1
mod m.
By (4.5), there exists an integer k with ts = 1 + kϕ(m). It follows that
rt ≡nst ≡n1+kϕ(m) ≡n · nkϕ(m) ≡n
mod m.
2
This proposition only determines the number n + km for some natural number
k. However, since the chosen number m is huge and the message is assumed to have
a reasonable length, we always have n < m. Hence k = 0.
The security of this method. If an intruder wants to decode the message,
he needs the number t, that is, ϕ(m) = (p −1)(q −1).
To get this number he must determine the prime number decomposition of
number m, which is known to him.
The trick of this method is simply that because of the size of chosen for the prime
numbers p and q, no computer is as yet able to determine the factors p and q in a
reasonable amount of time. Since computers are becoming more and more powerful
all the time, the security of this method is only guaranteed if one chooses new,
larger numbers p and q from time to time. More sophisticated coding methods are
based on the theory of elliptic curves in algebraic geometry.
The importance of quantum computers. The theory of quantum comput-
ers shows that there exist methods in order to factorize huge prime numbers in a
reasonable amount of time. Shor’s famous algorithm provides a quantum-computer
method for factorizing an integer N in a number of steps which is polynomial (less
than cubic) in the number of digits (i.e., ln N ·N 2). Up to now, the experimental re-
alization of quantum computers is missing and a challenge for the future. Problems
of quantum information will be studied in Volume IV. We recommend:

tum Computation, Springer, Berlin, 2002.

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
4.1.3 Quotient Rings, Quotient Groups, and Quotient Fields
In a straightforward manner, let us generalize the Gaussian quotient ring Z/mod m.
We recommend the reader to carry out the necessary proofs, which are easy conse-
quences of the relevant deﬁnitions. 10
Construction of quotient rings. Let J be a two-sided ideal of the ring R.
For elements x, y of R, we write
x ∼y
iﬀ
x −y ∈J.
This is an equivalence relation. For the corresponding equivalence classes, we deﬁne
an addition and a multiplication by setting
[x] + [z] := [x + z],
[x][z] := [xz].
The point is that this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the representatives.
This follows easily from the fact that J is a two-sided ideal. This way, the quotient
space R/ ∼becomes a ring denoted by R/J. This ring is called the quotient ring
of R modulo J. Set π(x) := [x]. The map
π : R →R/J
is a surjective ring morphism. Such morphisms are also called ring epimorphisms.
The morphism theorem for rings. Suppose that we are given the ring
morphism
f : R →T
(4.6)
between the two rings R and T. We introduce the kernel of f by setting
ker(f) := f −1(0)
where 0 denotes the zero element of the ring T. Explicitly, the set ker(f) is equal
to {r ∈R : f(r) = 0}. We also introduce the image of the morphism f by setting
im(f) := f(R). Finally, we set f∗([r]) := f(r). This deﬁnition does not depend on
the choice of the representative.
Theorem 4.5 The map f∗: R/ ker(f) →im(f) is a ring isomorphism.
Simple rings. The ring morphism (4.6) is called trivial iﬀT is isomorphic to
R or T = {0}. The ring R is called simple iﬀall the ring epimorphisms (4.6) are
trivial. This is equivalent to the fact that the two-sided ideals of R are trivial (i.e.,
they are equal to {0} or to R).
Quotient groups. If one replaces two-sided ideals by normal subgroups, then
the construction of quotient rings can be immediately translated to the construction
of quotient groups. Let S be a subgroup of the group G. Then S is called a normal
subgroup of G iﬀg−1sg ∈S for all s ∈S and all g ∈G.
Construction of quotient groups. Let S be a normal subgroup of the group
G. For elements x, y of G, we write
x ∼y
iﬀ
xy−1 ∈S.
This is an equivalence relation. For the corresponding equivalence classes, we deﬁne
a multiplication by setting
10 These proofs can be found in the two standard textbooks on algebra by van der
Waerden (1930) and Lang (2002) quoted on page 180.

4.1 Equivalence Classes in Algebra
185
[x][y] := [xy].
The point is that this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the representatives.
This follows easily from the fact that S is a normal subgroup. This way, the quotient
set G/ ∼becomes a group denoted by G/S. This group is called the quotient group
of G modulo S. Set π(x) := [x]. The map
π : G →G/S
is a surjective group morphism. Such morphisms are also called group epimor-
phisms.
The morphism theorem for groups. Suppose that we are given the group
morphism
f : G →H
(4.7)
between the two groups G and H. We introduce the kernel of f by setting
ker(f) := f −1(1)
where 1 denotes the unit element of the group H. Explicitly, the set ker(f) is equal
to {g ∈G : f(g) = 1}. We also introduce the image of the morphism f by setting
im(f) := f(G). Finally, we set f∗([g]) := f(g). This deﬁnition does not depend on
the choice of the representative.
Theorem 4.6 The map f∗: G/ ker(f) →im(f) is a group isomorphism.
Simple groups. The group morphism (4.7) is called trivial iﬀH is isomorphic
to G or H = {1}. The group G is called simple iﬀall the group epimorphisms (4.7)
are trivial. This is equivalent to the fact that the normal subgroups of G are trivial
(i.e., they are equal to {1} or to G.)
The ﬁnite simple groups are completely classiﬁed. The mathematicians needed
more than 100 years for this classiﬁcation. Note that the full proof comprehends
about 10 000 pages. We refer to:
D. Gorenstein, Classifying the ﬁnite simple groups, Bull. Amer. Math. Soc.
14 (1986), 1–98.
R. Solomon, A brief history of the classiﬁcation of the ﬁnite simple groups.
Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 38(3) (2001), 315–352.
The largest sporadic ﬁnite simple group has about 1064 elements. This group called
the Monster was discovered by using methods rooted in quantum ﬁeld theory (see
Sect. 17.5 of Vol. I).
The permutation group. Fix the number n = 1, 2, . . . Let X be a ﬁnite set
with n elements. The set of all bijective maps
π : X →X
forms a group Aut(X) which is called the automorphism group of the set X. If
π, σ ∈Aut(X), then the product πσ is given by the composition of maps, that is,
(πσ)(x) := π(σ(x))
for all
x ∈X.
If we denote the elements of X by 1, 2, . . . , n, then the elements π of Aut(X) can
be represented by the permutation
 
1
2 . . . n
x1 x2 . . . xn
!
.
(4.8)

186
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
The n! symbols (4.8) form a group called the symmetric group Sn. Obviously, we
have the group isomorphism Aut(X) ≃Sn. By deﬁnition, a transposition τ is an
element of Sn which transposes precisely two diﬀerent elements. For example, the
transposition between 1 and 3 reads as
τ =
 
1 2 3 4 . . . n
3 2 1 4 . . . n
!
.
The proof of the following proposition can be found in the standard textbook on
algebra by Lang (2002), p. 31, quoted on page 180.
Proposition 4.7 There exists precisely one group morphism
sgn : Sn →{1, −1}
from the symmetric group Sn to the multiplicative group {1 −1} such that we have
sgn(τ) = −1 for all transpositions τ.
The number sgn(π) is called the sign (or the parity) of the permutation π. Here,
π is said to be even (resp. odd) iﬀsgn(π) = 1 (resp. = −1). Each permutation π ∈Sn
can be represented as a product of transpositions:
π = τ1τ2 · · · τm.
Hence sgn(π) = sgn(τ1)sgn(τ2) · · · sgn(τn) = (−1)m. The even permutations consti-
tute the kernel of the map sgn: Sn →{1, −1}, which is called the alternating group
An. By the morphism theorem for groups, we have the isomorphism
Sn/An ≃{1, −1}.
The group An of order n!/2 is simple if n = 2, 3, or n ≥5. The group A4 is not
simple.
Quotient ﬁelds. The ring of integers Z is not a ﬁeld, however, it can be
extended to the ﬁeld of rational numbers which can be represented by fractions a
b of
integers a, b where b ̸= 0. We want to generalize this idea. In the next section, we will
consider an elegant application to the Heaviside calculus in electrical engineering.
In what follows all of the necessary computations resemble the computations known
for rational numbers. However, our arguments only rely on the relations valid in
rings and ﬁelds.
Zero divisors. In the Gaussian ring Z/mod 6, the decomposition 2 · 3 = 6
implies
[2][3] = [0].
The non-zero elements [2] and [3] are called zero divisors of the ring Z/mod 6.
Similarly, let R be an arbitrary ring. An element a of R is called a zero divisor iﬀ
a ̸= 0 and there exists a nonzero element of R such that ab = 0. Obviously, a ﬁeld
has never zero divisors. The Gaussian ring Z/mod m has no zero divisors iﬀeither
m = 1 or m is a prime number.
Fractions. Let F be a ﬁeld. For a, b ∈F with a ̸= 0, we deﬁne
a
b := ab−1.
It turns out that these fractions possess the usual properties known from rational
numbers. In fact, for all a, b, c, d ∈F with a ̸= 0 and d ̸= 0 , the following hold:11
11 In (F4), we also assume that c ̸= 0.

4.1 Equivalence Classes in Algebra
187
(F1) Equality: a
b = c
d iﬀad = bc.
(F2) Addition: a
b + c
d = ad+bc

(F3) Multiplication:
` a

= ac
cd.
(F4) Division:
` a

´−1 = ad
bc .
Proof. In a ﬁeld, we always have bb−1 = 1, and (bc)−1 = c−1b−1. Furthermore,
note that ac = ca because of commutativity.
Ad (F1). If a
b = c
d, then ab−1 = d−1c. Multiplying this by b, we get a = d−1cb.
Hence da = cb. This argument can be reversed.
Ad (F2). We have to show that
(ad + bc)(bd)−1 = ab−1 + cd−1.
In fact, this follows from (ab−1 + cd−1)bd = ad + bc.
Ad (F3), (F4). Argue similarly.
2
The extension theorem. Let R be a commutative ring without zero divi-
sors.12 Then the following hold.
Theorem 4.8 (i) The ring R can be extended to a ﬁeld F. The elements of F have
precisely the form ab−1 with a, b ∈R and b ̸= 0.
(ii) The extension is universal, that is, each extension of R to a ﬁeld F contains
a subﬁeld which is isomorphic to F.
(iii) If R is a real (resp. complex) algebra, then so is F.
Proof. Ad (i). (I) Equivalence relation. Let a, b, c, d ∈R with a ̸= 0 and c ̸= 0.
Our idea is to use symbols a
b and to write
a
b ∼c
d
iﬀad = bc. This is an equivalence relation. For example, a
b ∼a
b follows from ab = ba.
The equivalence classes are denoted by [ a
b ].
(II) Multiplication of equivalence classes. We deﬁne
ha
b
i h c
d
i
:=
hac
bd
i
.
The point is that this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the representatives
of the equivalence classes. To see this, we have to show that
ha
b
i
=
»a′
b′
–
and
h c
d
i
=
» c′
d′
–
imply
ha
b
i h c
d
i
=
»a′

– » c′
d′
–
.
In fact, if ab′ = ba′, cd′ = c′d, then ab′cd′ = ba′c′d. Hence (ac)(b′d′) = (bd)(a′c′).
(III) Addition: We deﬁne
ha
b
i
+
h c
d
i
:=
»ad + bc
bd
–
.
Again one shows that this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the repre-
sentatives. Here, we need that b ̸= 0 and c ̸= 0 imply bc ̸= 0. This follows from our
assumption that the ring R has no zero divisors. Furthermore, one checks that the
12 We assume that R is not trivial, that is, it has at least one non-zero element.
But, we do not assume that R has a unit element.

188
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
equivalence classes form a ring with the zero element 0 := [ 0
b ] and the unit element
1 := [ b
b].
(IV) Invertibility: If a ̸= 0 and b ̸= 0, then
ha
b
i » b
a
–
=
»ab
ab
–
= 1.
Consequently, the equivalence classes form a ﬁeld F.
(V) Identiﬁcation of the ring elements: For all nonzero elements b, b′ of R, we
have
ab
b ∼ab′
b′ ,
since (ab)b′ = b(ab′). Hence
ˆ ab
b
˜
=
h
ab′
b′
i
. For each a ∈R, deﬁne
χ(a) :=
»ab
b
–
.
(4.9)
The map χ : R →F does not depend on the choice of b. Thus, χ is well-deﬁned.
One shows easily that χ respects addition and multiplication. Thus, χ is a ring
morphism. In addition, the map χ is injective. In fact, if
»ab
b
–
=
»a′b
b
–
,
then ab2 = a′b2, and hence (a −a′)b2 = 0. Since b ̸= 0, and the ring R has no zero
divisors, we get b2 ̸= 0, and hence a −a′ = 0. Summarizing, the map χ : R →χ(R)
is a ring isomorphism. If we identify the subring χ(R) of F with R, then the ﬁeld
F is an extension of R.
Ad (ii). Suppose that F is another ﬁeld extension of R. Deﬁne
ϱ
“ha
b
i”
:= ab−1.
This map does not depend on the representatives. One also shows that the map
ϱ : F →F is an injective ring morphism. Thus, F is isomorphic to ϱ(F).
Ad (iii) Suppose that, say, R is a real algebra. For each real number α, we deﬁne
α
ha
b
i
:=
hαa
b
i
.
This map does not depend on the choice of the representatives. This way, the ﬁeld

4.1.4 Linear Quotient Spaces
Let X be a linear subspace of the linear space Z over K. For u, v ∈Z, we write
u ∼v
iﬀ
u −v ∈X.
This is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes have the form
[u] = u + X = {u + x : x ∈X}.

Intuitively, if Z = R3 and X is a one-dimensional (resp. 2-dimensional) subspace of
Z, then u+X is a straight line (resp. plane) passing through the point u and being
parallel to the straight line (resp. plane) X. For all u, v ∈Z and α, β ∈K, we set
α[u] + β[v] := [αu + βv].
This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the representatives. This follows
from αX + βX = {αx + βy : x, y ∈X} = X, and hence
α(u + X) + β(v + X) = (αu + βv) + X.
This way, the quotient space Z/ ∼becomes a linear space over K which is denoted
by Z/X. From the geometric point of view, the quotient space Z/X operates with
straight lines or planes (i.e., linear manifolds).
Projection operator. Let X and Y be linear subspaces of the linear space Z
over K. Suppose that each element z of Z allows the following unique sum repre-
sentation
z = x + y,
x ∈X, y ∈Y.
Deﬁne
Pz := x
for all
z ∈Z.
The operator P : Z →X has the typical property that it is linear and P 2 = P
(Fig. 4.1). Precisely such operators are called projection operators. The operator
I −P : Z →Y
is also a projection operator. In fact, the operator I −P is linear, and (I −P)2 is
equal to I −2P + P 2 = I −P. Hence (I −P)2 = I −P. We have
Z = X ⊕Y,
P(Z) = X, (I −P)(Z) = Y.
The mapping y →[y] yields the following isomorphism.
Proposition 4.9 The complementary linear subspace Y is linear isomorphic to the
quotient space Z/X.
Thus, for each linear subspace X of the linear space Z over K, we get the direct
sum decomposition
Z = X ⊕Z/X.
Note that if Z = X ⊕Y, then the quotient space Z/X is uniquely determined by
Z and X, in contrast to the space Y . The dimension of the quotient space Z/X is
called the codimension of the linear subspace X with respect to the linear space Z.
We write
codim(X) := dim(Z/X).

190
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
The dimension of a linear space is an absolute invariant under linear isomorphisms.
In contrast to this, the codimension of a linear space is only a relative invariant. If
the dimension of Z is ﬁnite, then
codim(X) = dim(Z) −dim(X).
For example, in the 3-dimensional space of our intuition, a plane has the dimension
2 and the codimension 1. The morphism theorem for linear morphisms (i.e., linear
operators) L : X →Y between the two linear spaces X and Y over K reads as
follows.
Theorem 4.10 If L : X →Y is a linear morphism, then we have the linear
isomorphism X/ker(L) ≃im(L).
Here, the kernel ker(L) := L−1(0) is a linear subspace of X. The proof proceeds
as for rings on page 184.
4.1.5 Ideals and Quotient Algebras
Let A be an algebra over K. For subsets B and C of A, we deﬁne
B + C := {b + c : b ∈B, c ∈C},
BC := {bc : b ∈B, c ∈C}.
Using this convenient notation, we obtain the following:
• The subset B of A is a linear subspace iﬀαB + βB = B for all α, β ∈K.
• The subset J of A is called a two-sided ideal iﬀJA = AJ = J.
Let J be a two-sided ideal of A. Since the algebra A is a linear space, the quotient
space A/J is a linear space. Additionally, A/J becomes an algebra over K if we
introduce the following multiplication
[u][v] := [uv].
This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of representatives. In fact,
(u + J)(v + J) = uv + (uJ + vJ + JJ) = uv + J.
The morphism theorem for algebra morphisms χ : A →B between the two algebras
A and B over K reads as follows.
Theorem 4.11 If χ : A →B is an algebra morphism, then we have the algebra
isomorphism A/ker(χ) ≃im(χ).
Here, the kernel ker(χ) := χ−1(0) is a two-sided ideal of A. The proof proceeds
as for rings on page 184.
Further constructions for linear spaces. In addition to the preceding ma-
terial, there exist the following constructions for linear spaces X, Y, Xα:
• the inductive (or direct) limit: lim indα∈AXα (Sect. 4.5.5);
• the projective (or inverse) limit: lim projα∈AXα (Sect. 4.5.5);
• the K-ring K(VectK) generated by the semi-ring of ﬁnite-dimensional vector
spaces over K (Sect. 4.4.9);
• the K-ring KK(X) generated by the semi-ring of vector bundles of ﬁnite rank on
the topological space X (Sect. 4.4.9);
• the tensor product X ⊗Y , and the tensor algebra N(X) (Vol. III);

• the algebra A(X) of antisymmetric multilinear functionals, and the Grassmann
(or exterior) algebra V(X) (Vol. III);
• the algebra S(X) of symmetric multilinear functionals, and the symmetric alge-
bra J(X) (Vol. III);
• the Cliﬀord (or inner) algebra W(X) (Vol. III).
4.2 Superfunctions and the Heaviside Calculus in
Electrical Engineering
The historical experience of mathematicians shows that successful formal
approaches invented by physicists can be rigorously justiﬁed, possibly, after
large time delay. For example, this concerns Heaviside’s calculus in electri-
cal engineering (Laplace transform and Mikusi´nski’s operational calculus),
Dirac’s delta function in quantum mechanics (Laurent Schwartz’s theory
of distributions), Dirac’s operator calculus (Gelfand triplets and distribu-
tions), and Leibniz’s inﬁnitesimals in calculus (Robinson’s non-standard
analysis). There is no reason why there should not emerge a rigorous jus-
tiﬁcation of quantum ﬁeld theory in the future.
Folklore
In this book, the operators of the Heaviside calculus in electrical engineer-
ing are represented by (abstract) fractions of continuous functions.13
Jan Mikusi´nski, 1959
The convolution algebra. Let R denote the set of all continuous functions
f : [0, ∞[→C.
For f, g ∈R and α, β ∈C, we deﬁne the usual linear combination αf + βg. As
product f ∗g, we choose the convolution
(f ∗g)(t) :=
Z ∞
0
f(t)g(t −τ)dτ
for all
t ≥0.
For example, set l(t) := 1 for all t ≥1. Let f ∈R. Then
(l ∗f)(t) =
Z t
0
f(τ)dτ
for all
t ≥0.
(4.10)
If the function f : [0, ∞[→R is continuous and continuously diﬀerentiable, then
the fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that
(l ∗f ′)(t) =
Z t
0
f ′(τ)dτ = f(t) −f(+0)
for all
t ≥0.
In terms of the convolution algebra R, this means l ∗f ′ = f −f(+0)l. Elementary
properties of the convolution product tell us that R is a commutative ring and a
complex algebra. The following theorem due to Titchmarsh (1899–1963) formulates
a non-trivial property of the convolution product.
Theorem 4.12 The convolution algebra R has no zero divisors.

192
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
Explicitly, this means the following. Let f, g : [0, ∞[→C be two continuous
functions with (f ∗g)(t) = 0 for all t ∈R. Then at least one of the functions f
or g vanishes identically. The elegant proof can be found in K. Yosida, Functional
Analysis, Sect. VI.5, Springer, New York, 1995. The Titchmarsh theorem is one of
the jewels in harmonic analysis.
The ﬁeld of superfunctions. By Theorem 4.8 on page 187, the convolution
algebra R can be extended to a ﬁeld F which is uniquely determined (up to iso-
morphism). The ﬁeld F is also a complex algebra. Here, F is called the Mikunsi´nki
ﬁeld. To simplify notation, we write fg instead of f ∗g. The elements of F are
called superfunctions. In the sense of (F1)–(F4) on page 186, the elements of F are
fractions of the form
f
g ,
f, g ∈R, g ̸= 0.
Observe the crucial fact that fractions refer to the product on the ﬁeld F, but not
to the division of continuous functions in the usual sense. The unit element 1 of
the ﬁeld F is given by
1 = f
f
for all
f ∈R, f ̸= 0.
Let us consider some examples of superfunctions.
(i) Integration: Choose the element l of R deﬁned by l(t) := 1 for all t ∈R. For all
f ∈R, set g := lf (in the sense of the multiplication on the ﬁeld F). By (4.10),
we have g ∈R and g(t) =
R t
0 f(τ)dτ for all t ≥0.
(ii) The unit element 1. Suppose that there exists a unit element in the convolution
ring R. We denote this unit element by δ. It follows from f ∗δ = f for all f ∈R
that
Z t
0
f(τ)δ(t −τ)dτ = f(t)
for all
t ≥0.
However, there is no continuous function δ : [0, ∞[→C which has this property.
Thus, the convolution ring R has no unit element. But the Minkusi´nski ﬁeld
F has the unit element 1. This superfunction can be regarded as the rigorous
version of the Dirac delta function in the Mikusi´nski setting. In particular, note
that the element l of R is diﬀerent from 1. We have 1 = l
l.
(iii) Diﬀerentiation: Set s := l−1. For all continuous and continuously diﬀerentiable
functions f : [0, ∞[→C, we have the following key relation for the Heaviside
calculus:
f ′ = sf −f(+0)1.
(4.11)
In fact, it follows from lf ′ = f −f(+0)l and sl = 1 that
f ′ = (sl)f ′ = sf −f(+0)l
l = sf −f(+0)1.
(iv) Exponential function: Fix the complex number α. Set h(t) := eαt for all t ≥0.
Then, in terms of the Mikusi´nski ﬁeld F,
h =
1
s −α1.
In fact, h′ = αh. Hence αh = sh−h(+0)1 = sh−1, by (iii). Thus, (s−α1)h = 1.

4.2 Superfunctions and the Heaviside Calculus in Electrical Engineering
193
Application to the Heaviside calculus. As a simple example, consider the
initial-value problem
x′(t) −αx(t) = f(t),
t ≥0,
x(+0) = x0.
(4.12)
We are given the continuous function f : [0, ∞[→C, and the complex numbers
α, x0. In the Mikusi´nski ﬁeld F, equation (4.12) reads as
sx −x01 −αx = f.
Hence (s −α1)x = x01 + f. By (iv),
x =
x01
s −α1 +
f
s −α1 = x0h + hf.
Recall that the product hf in the ﬁeld F stands for the convolution product h ∗f.
Therefore, the solution of our problem (4.12) is given by
x = x0h + h ∗f.
Explicitly, noting that h ∗f = f ∗h, the solution of (4.12) reads as
x(t) = eαtx0 +
Z t
0
eα(t−τ)f(τ) dτ
for all
t ≥0.
This justiﬁes rigorously the symbolic Heaviside method considered in (1.28) on page
30. The approach can be simpliﬁed by cancelling the (redundant) unit element 1
of the ﬁeld F. Then
x =
x0
s −α +
f
s −α.
Many applications in engineering can be found in the classical monograph by
J. Mikusi´nski, Operational Calculus, Pergamon Press, Oxford, 1959.
The Polish engineer Jan Mikusi´nski founded this approach in the 1950s. Roughly
speaking, Mikusi´nski’s method is equivalent to the use of the Laplace transform
(see Sect. 1.31 on page 32). We also refer to: K. Yosida, Operational Calculus: A
Theory of Hyperfunctions, Springer, New York, 1984. In 1959 Sato introduced a
class of generalized functions which he called hyperfunctions:

Soc. 54(2) (2007), 243–245.
Roughly speaking, distributions in the sense of Laurent Schwartz are dual objects
to smooth functions. Similarly, roughly speaking, Sato’s hyperfunctions are dual
objects to analytic functions. The general theory together with applications to
partial diﬀerential equations is investigated in:

4.3.1 The Basic Idea of Geometry Epitomized by Klein’s
Erlangen Program
The geometry known in ancient times was Euclidean geometry, and it dominated
mathematics for over 2000 years. The famous question as to the existence of non–
Euclidean geometries led in the nineteenth century to the description of a series
of diﬀerent geometries. This being established, it was natural to consider the clas-
siﬁcation of possible geometries. Felix Klein (1849–1925) solved this problem and
showed in 1872 with his Erlangen program that geometries can be conveniently
classiﬁed by means of group theory. A geometry requires a group G of transfor-
mations. Every property or quantity remaining invariant under the action of the
group G is a property of the associated geometry, which is therefore also referred to
as a G-geometry. For example, the Euclidean geometry corresponds to invariants
under the Euclidean group of motions, which consists of translations and rotations.
In particular, the distance between two points is a property of Euclidean geometry.
For the modern version of Klein’s Erlangen program, we refer to:

langen Program, Springer, New York, 1997.
4.3.2 Symmetry Spaces, Orbit Spaces, and Homogeneous Spaces
A G-space (X, G) describes a geometry on the space X which possesses
the symmetry group G.
Folklore
In gauge theory, orbit spaces play a fundamental role. For example, in the Standard
Model in particle physics, the orbits under the action of the gauge group represent
the same physical state. Since the Feynman functional integral has to be taken over
physical states, this integral becomes an integral over an orbit space of the gauge
group. This is the idea of the method of Faddeev–Popov quantization in gauge
theory (see Chap. 16 of Vol. I). At this point, we want to discuss same basic ideas
of orbit spaces in geometry and theirs relations to quantum states and projective
spaces. Let n = 0, 1, 2, . . . To ﬁx the terminology, the symbol
Sn := {x ∈Rn+1 : x2
1 + x2
2 + . . . + x2
n+1 = 1}
denotes the n-dimensional unit sphere. Observe that this sphere is the boundary of
the (n + 1)-dimensional closed unit ball centered at the origin:
Bn+1 := {x ∈Rn+1 : x2
1 + x2
2 + . . . + x2
n+1 ≤1}.
Let R > 0, and let a ∈Rn+1, where a = (a1, . . . , an+1). The set
Bn+1
R
(a) := {x ∈Rn+1 : (x1 −a1)2 + . . . + (xn+1 −an+1)2 ≤R2}

Fig. 4.2. Riemann sphere
is called the (n+1)-dimensional closed ball of radius R centered at the point a. The
interior of Bn+1
R
(a) is called the (n + 1)-dimensional open ball of radius R centered
at the point a. Explicitly,
int Bn+1
R
(a) = {x ∈Rn+1 : (x1 −a1)2 + . . . + (xn+1 −an+1)2 < R2}.
The boundary ∂Bn+1

R
(a) is given by
∂Bn+1
R
(a) = {x ∈Rn+1 : (x1 −a1)2 + . . . + (xn+1 −an+1)2 = R2}.
This is an n-dimensional sphere of radius R centered at the point a. We write Sn
R
instead of ∂Bn+1
R
(0). Recall that the set C of all complex numbers is called the
Gaussian plane. If we add the point ∞, then we get the closed Gaussian plane
C := C ∪{∞}.
By stereographic projection, the closed Gaussian plane C is bijective to the Riemann
sphere S2 (Fig. 4.2). This stereographic projection preserves angles; thus, it is a
conformal map. We will show in Sect. 4.3.5 on page 203 that the Riemann sphere is
also bijective to the projective complex line P1
C. The Riemann sphere S2 is an arcwise
connected 1-dimensional complex manifold (i.e., it is a Riemann surface). To prove
this, we have to introduce local complex coordinates. Note that the stereographic
projection pictured in Fig. 4.2 sends the North Pole N (resp. the South Pole S ) to
the point ∞(resp. to the origin 0) of the extended complex plane C.
• The points P of the punctured sphere S2 \ {N} can be described by the local
complex coordinates z(P) via stereographic projection.
• Now consider the points P on the punctured sphere S2 \ {S}. If P ̸= N, then
stereographic projection assigns the complex number z(P) to the point P. Finally,
we assign the local complex coordinate ζ(P) to the point P by setting
ζ(P) :=
(
1
z(P )
if
P ̸= N,
0
if
P = N.
• For a point P ∈S2 \ {N, S}, the change of local coordinates from z(P) to ζ(P)
is described by the holomorphic map z →1
z on C \ {0}.
The space C/U(1) as the prototype of an orbit space. Let us consider
the group U(1) := {eiϕ : ϕ ∈R}. Fix g ∈U(1), and deﬁne
ϱ(g)z := gz
for all
z ∈C.
If g, h ∈U(1), then ϱ(h)(ϱ(g)z) = ϱ(hg)z for all z ∈C. The map

Fig. 4.3. Action of the rotation group on the plane
ϱ(g) : C →C
represents a rotation of the Gaussian plane C about the origin z = 0. If g = eiϕ,
then ϕ is the rotation angle. We write
w ∼z
mod U(1)
iﬀthere exists an element g of the group U(1) such that w = ϱ(g)z. This means
that the point z can be moved to the point w by a rotation. This is an equivalence
relation because of the group property of U(1). The equivalence classes [z] are
called orbits of the action of the group U(1) on the Gaussian plane C. The set
of these orbits is denoted by C/U(1), and we call this the orbit space. Intuitively,
the orbits are concentric circles about the origin (Fig. 4.3). Obviously, the orbits
decompose the Gaussian plane into pairwise disjoint sets. Let us reformulate this in
the language of ﬁber bundles. To this end, we parametrize the orbit space C/U(1).
Let Ox denote that orbit which intersects the real line at the point x ≥0. Then
C =
[
x∈[0,∞[
Ox.
For each point z ∈C, there is precisely one orbit Ox which passes through z. We
deﬁne π(z) := x. This way, we get the surjective map
π : C →[0, ∞[.
The pre-images of π are called ﬁbers. Explicitly, π−1(x) = Ox, that is, the ﬁbers
coincide with the orbits. The family of ﬁbers
{Ox}x∈[0,∞[
is called an abstract ﬁber bundle. Obviously, C/U(1) ≃[0, ∞[, in the sense of a
bijection. Thus, the orbit space C/U(1) can be identiﬁed with the interval [0, ∞[,
which is not a manifold, but only a manifold with boundary.
Typically, orbit spaces are not manifolds, since they have singularities.
Klein spaces. Let X be a set, and let G be a group. The set of all bijections
A : X →X
forms a group which is called the automorphism group of X. This group is denoted
by Aut(X). The ordered pair
(X, G)
is called a Klein space (or G-space) iﬀthere exists a group morphism
ϱ : G →Aut(X).

4.3 Equivalence Classes in Geometry
197
The map ϱ is called a representation of the group G by a transformation group on
the space X. Explicitly, this means that, for all g, h ∈G, the map ϱ(g) : X →X is
a bijection with
ϱ(hg) = ϱ(h)ϱ(g).
The set {ϱ(g) : g ∈G} forms a subgroup of Aut(G) which is called a transformation
group of X induced by the symmetry group G. We also say that the symmetry group
G acts on the space X. For two points x, y ∈X, we write
x ∼y
mod G
iﬀthere exists an element g of the symmetry group G such that
y = ϱ(g)x.
This is an equivalence relation on the space X. The equivalence classes [x] are called
orbits of the action of the group G on the space X. The set of all orbits is denoted
by
X/G.
This is also called the orbit space induced by the action of the group G on the space
X. The stabilizer stab(x0) of the point x0 on the space X is deﬁned by
stab(x0) := {g ∈G : ϱ(g)x0 = x0}.
This is a subgroup of G. In other words, an element g of the symmetry group G
belongs to the stabilizer stab(x0) iﬀthe point x0 of the space X remains ﬁxed under
the action of g. The stabilizer stab(x0) is called trivial iﬀit contains only the unit
element of G. In geometry, one uses the following terminology:
• The action of the group G on the space X is called transitive iﬀthere is only one
orbit.
• The action of G on X is called eﬀective iﬀthe map ϱ : G →Aut(X) is injective.
• The action of G on X is called faithful iﬀthe map ϱ : G →Aut(X) is bijective.
• The action of G on X is called free iﬀthe stabilizer stab(x0) is trivial for all
points x0 ∈X.
In the case of Fig. 4.3, the stabilizer stab(x0) is equal to U(1) if x0 = 0, and it is
trivial if x0 ̸= 0. The action of the rotation group U(1) on the Gaussian plane C is
faithful, but neither transitive nor free. In contrast to this, for all a ∈C, the action
of the translation group z →z + a on C is transitive, faithful, and free.
Morphisms of Klein spaces. Let (X, G) and (Y, G) be Klein spaces with the
corresponding representations
ϱ : G →Aut(X)
and
σ : G →Aut(Y )
of the group G on X and Y , respectively. By deﬁnition, a morphism (resp. isomor-
phism) from (X, G) to (Y, G) is a map (resp. a bijection) μ : X →Y such that the
following diagram is commutative for all elements g of the symmetry group G:
X

Homogeneous spaces. By deﬁnition, a homogeneous space X under the ac-
tion of the symmetry group G is a Klein space (X, G) which has precisely one orbit
(i.e., the action is transitive). Let us consider some examples.

198
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
• The unit circle S1 is a homogeneous space under the action of the rotation group
in the plane.
• The 2-dimensional unit sphere S2 is a homogeneous space under the action of
the rotation group. In fact, each given point of S2 can be moved to an arbitrary
point of S2 by using a rotation.
• The Euclidean plane (resp. the 3-dimensional Euclidean space) is homogeneous
under the action of the translation group.
• Let S be a subgroup of the group G. We want to show that the orbit space G/S
is homogeneous under the action of the group G.
To this end, we write g ∼h iﬀg−1h ∈S. This is an equivalence relation. The
corresponding equivalence classes [g] form the quotient space G/ ∼. Explicitly,
[g] = {gs : s ∈S}
for all
g ∈G.
Brieﬂy, [g] = gS. Fix s ∈S, and deﬁne the map ϱ(s) : G →G by setting
ϱ(s)g := sg
for all
g ∈G.
This way, the subgroup S acts on the group G. The orbits of the Klein space
(G, S) are precisely the equivalence classes [g]. Thus,
G/S = G/ ∼.
Now ﬁx h ∈G, and set
χ(h)([g]) := [hg]
for all equivalence classes [g]. The map χ(h) does not depend on the choice of
the representatives. Therefore, the group G acts on G/S by means of the maps
χ(h) : G/S →G/S. This way, we get the Klein space (G/S, G). The action
of G on G/S is transitive. In fact, for two equivalence classes [g], [r], we have
χ(rg−1)[g] = [r]. Consequently, the Klein space (G/S, G) has precisely one orbit,
that is, the orbit space G/S is a homogeneous space.
Classiﬁcation of Klein spaces. Let (X, G) be a Klein space. Then X is the
disjoint union of the orbits O in X. For any orbit O, there is a Klein space (O, G),
and O is a homogeneous space under the action of G. Therefore, it is suﬃcient to
classify the Klein spaces (X, G) where the space X is homogeneous.
Theorem 4.13 We are given the homogeneous space X with the symmetry group
G. Then the following hold:
(i) If we ﬁx a point x0 in X, then the Klein space (X, G) is isomorphic to the
Klein space (G/stab(x0), G).
(ii) If the stabilizer stab(x0) is a normal subgroup of the symmetry group G,
then the quotient space G/stab(x0) is a group.
(iii) If S and T are subgroups of G, then the Klein spaces (G/S, G) and (G/T, G)
are isomorphic iﬀS is conjugate to T.
Recall that, by deﬁnition, the subgroup S is conjugate to the subgroup T iﬀ
there exists an element g of G such that S = {gtg−1 : t ∈T}. For the proof of the
theorem, we refer to Problem 4.1.

4.3.3 The Space of Quantum States
In contrast to the underlying complex Hilbert space, the space of quantum
states has a nontrivial topological structure.
Folklore
In the following sections of this chapter, the symbol A ≃B means that there exists
a bijective map from the set A onto the set B. In other words, the sets A and B
are equivalent, in the sense of set theory.
Complex Hilbert space. Let X be a complex Hilbert space. The symbol X×
denotes the nonzero elements of X.14 For ψ, ϕ ∈X×, we write
ψ ∼ϕ
iﬀthere exists a number λ ∈C× such that ψ = λϕ. Obviously, this is an equivalence
relation. The corresponding equivalence classes
[ψ] = {λψ ∈X : λ ∈C×}
are called quantum states (or rays). The set of all quantum states [ψ] of the Hilbert
space X is denoted by P(X). Thus,
P(X) = X×/ ∼.
Equivalently, this is the orbit space X×/C× of the Hilbert space X under the
action ψ →λψ of the multiplicative group C×. The elements ψ ∈X× are called
representatives of quantum states. The relation of P(X) to projective geometry
will be studied below. Let A : D(A) →X be a self-adjoint operator on X (e.g., a
complex self-adjoint (n × n)-matrix acting on X = Cn). For ψ ∈X× ∩D(A), we
deﬁne
ψ := ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩
⟨ψ|ψ⟩.
This complex number only depends on the quantum state [ψ]. We call ψ the mean
value of the observable A (e.g., energy) measured in the quantum state [ψ]. Let us
introduce the following notions:
• S(X) := {ψ ∈X : ||ψ|| = 1} (unit sphere of X);
• B(X) := {ψ ∈X : ||ψ|| ≤1} (closed unit ball in X);
• int
`
B(X)
´
:= {ψ ∈X : ||ψ|| < 1} (open unit ball in X);15
• S(X)/U(1) (the orbit space of the sphere S(X) under the action ψ →λψ of the
group U(1) of complex numbers λ with |λ| = 1);
• Gm(X) is the space of all m-dimensional linear subspaces of the Hilbert space X
(m-Grassmann space of X).16
We have the following bijections:
P(X) ≃X×/C× ≃G1(X) ≃S(X)/U(1).

In fact, the maps
[ψ] →[ψ] ∪{0},
[ψ] →[ψ] ∩S(X)

complex) numbers.

Real Hilbert space. Let X be a real Hilbert space. Then we introduce the
same symbols as in the complex case above by using the following replacements:
C× ⇒R×,
U(1) →{1, −1}.
In particular, we obtain the following bijections:
P(X) ≃X×/R× ≃G1(X) ≃S(X)/{1, −1}.
Here, the Grassmann space G1(X) is the set of all 1-dimensional linear subspaces of
the real Hilbert space X, and S(X)/{1, −1} is the set of all antipodal pairs (ψ, −ψ)
of the unit sphere S(X).
4.3.4 Real Projective Spaces
Algebraic geometry is undoubtedly the area of mathematics where the de-
viation is greatest between the intuitive ideas forming its starting point
and the abstract and complex concepts at the foundation of modern re-
search. . . The history of algebraic geometry has been divided into seven
epochs:
(i) 400 B.C.–1630 A.D.: Prehistory (theory of conics by Appolonius of
Perga).
(ii) 1630–1795: Exploration of plane curves (Descartes, Newton, Leibniz,
Euler, Maclaurin, B´ezout).
(iii) 1795–1850: The golden age of projective geometry (Poncelet, M¨obius,
Pl¨ucker).
(iv) 1850–1866: Riemann and conformal (birational) geometry.
(v) 1866–1920: Development and chaos.
(vi) 1920–1950: New structures in algebraic geometry (Poincar´e, ´Elie Car-
tan, Hodge, de Rham, Lefschetz, K¨ahler, Weil, Kodaira).
(vii) 1950ﬀ: Sheaves (Leray, Henri Cartan, Serre), the Riemann–Roch–
Hirzebruch theorem (Hirzebruch), and schemes (Grothendieck).
The fourth epoch is without any doubt the most important of all in the
history of algebraic geometry to this day. It is entirely stamped by the work
of one man, one of the greatest mathematicians who ever lived, and also
one of those who have had, most profoundly, the perception (or divination)
of the essential unity of mathematics.17
Jean Dieudonn´e, 1985
The real projective line P1. By deﬁnition, the points of P1 are the antipodal
pairs {P+, P−} of the unit sphere S1. To each point P on the real line R1, we assign
the antipodal pair {P+, P−} as pictured in Fig. 4.4. In particular, the origin x = 0
on the real line corresponds to {(0, 1), (0, −1)}. The equatorial pair {(1, 0), (−1, 0)}
represents the unique inﬁnite point of the real line. We have the bijection
P1 ≃S1.

In fact, P1 is bijective to the upper semi-circle where the two equatorial points (1, 0)
and (−1, 0) are identiﬁed with each other. Gluing the two endpoints together, we
get a circle. Consequently, the real projective line P1 can be equipped with such a
topology that it is homeomorphic to the unit circle S1.
The real projective plane P2 and inﬁnite points. In the Euclidean plane,
two diﬀerent straight lines do not always intersect. This is an imperfect situation,
which prevents the formulation of an elegant duality between points and straight
lines in Euclidean geometry.
In mathematics, one always tries to cure imperfect situations by introduc-
ing ideal elements.
For example, the fact that the equation x2 + 1 = 0 has no real solution led to
the invention of the imaginary number √−1 in the 16th century. In geometry, one
introduces inﬁnite points. Let us restrict to the situation of a plane. By deﬁnition,
an inﬁnite point is the (non-oriented) direction of a straight line in the Euclidean
plane. We say that two diﬀerent straight lines intersect each other in an inﬁnite
point iﬀthey have the same direction, that is, they are parallel. By deﬁnition, all
the inﬁnite points form the inﬁnite straight line. The projective plane P2 is obtained
from the Euclidean plane by adding the set of all inﬁnite points. Furthermore, we
add the inﬁnite straight line to the set of all straight lines. For the projective plane,
the following hold:
• Two diﬀerent straight lines always uniquely determine one speciﬁc point (i.e.,
the intersection point).
• Two diﬀerent points uniquely determine one speciﬁc straight line (i.e., the con-
necting straight line).
For example, a ﬁnite point P and an inﬁnite point (i.e., a direction) P∞determine
uniquely one speciﬁc straight line which passes through the point P and has the
direction P∞.
In analytical terms, we start with the two equations for the given straight lines:
y −x + 1 = 0,
y −x + 2 = 0,
(x, y) ∈R2.
Using a ﬁxed Cartesian coordinate system, we describe the Euclidean plane (resp.
the 3-dimensional Euclidean space) by R2 (resp. R3). The basic trick of pro-
jective geometry is to pass from coordinates (x, y) in R2 to homogeneous coor-
dinates (x, y, z) which are contained in R3. Explicitly, we use the replacement
x ⇒x/z, y ⇒y/z with the real nonzero number z. This yields the modiﬁed
homogeneous equations
y −x + z = 0,
y −x + 2z = 0,
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
(x, y, z) ̸= (0, 0, 0).
The general solution (x, y, z) is given by the set {λ(1, 1, 0) : λ ∈R×}. By deﬁnition,
this is a point of the projective plane P2. In general, for two nonzero tuples (x, y, z)
and (x′, y′, z′) in R3, we write

(x, y, z) ∼(x′, y′, z′)
iﬀthere exists a nonzero real number λ with (x, y, z) = λ(x′, y′, z′). This is an
equivalence relation. The equivalence classes
[(x, y, z)]
are called points of the projective plane P2. Each point of P2 has either the form
[(x, y, 1)] (ﬁnite point) or the form [(x, y, 0)] with x2 + y2 ̸= 0 (inﬁnite point).
• The ﬁnite point [(x, y, 1)] of P2 can be identiﬁed with the point (x, y) of R2.
• The inﬁnite point [(x, y, 0)] can be identiﬁed with a straight line in R2 which
passes through the points (0, 0) and (x, y).
Using the real Hilbert space X := R3 and the notation introduced in Sect. 4.3.3 on
page 199, we have the following bijections:
P2 ≃(R3)×/R× ≃G1(R3) ≃S2/{1, −1}.
(4.15)
Let us discuss this. To begin with, note that the points of the real projective plane
P2 can be identiﬁed with straight lines in R3 which pass through the origin. This
yields the bijection P2 ≃G1(R3). Moreover, each of these straight lines intersects
the 2-dimensional unit sphere S2 in precisely two points which are antipodal points
(Fig. 4.5(a)). Therefore, the points of P2 can be identiﬁed with pairs of antipodal
points of S2. This yields the bijection P2 ≃S2/{1, −1}. Precisely the antipodal
pairs of the equator of S2 correspond to inﬁnite points of the real projective plane
P2. In addition, we have the following bijections:
P2 ≃(S2
+/ ∼) ≃(B1/ ∼).
Here, S2
+/ ∼denotes the closed northern hemisphere of the sphere S2, where an-
tipodal points P+, P−of the equator are identiﬁed with each other (Fig. 4.5(b)).
Projection of S2
+/ ∼onto the Euclidean (x, y)-plane yields the set B1/ ∼. Explic-
itly, B1/ ∼represents the closed unit disc where antipodal points P+, P−on the
boundary are identiﬁed with each other (Fig. 4.5(c)).
Finally, we want to consider a hyperbola in the setting of projective geometry.
Fix a > 0 and b > 0. Consider the hyperbola
x2
a2 −y2
b2 = 1,
(x, y) ∈R2,
(4.16)
with respect to Cartesian (x, y)-coordinates in the Euclidean plane. Using the re-
placement x ⇒x/z, y ⇒y/z with the nonzero real number z, we get the equation
of the hyperbola,

4.3 Equivalence Classes in Geometry
203
x2
a2 −y2
b2 = z2,
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
(x, y, z) ̸= (0, 0, 0),
(4.17)
with respect to homogenous coordinates (x, y, z). This equation has the solutions
(x, y, z) = (a, ±b, 0).
Note that the two inﬁnite points [(a, b, 0)] and [(a, −b, 0)] on the projective hyper-
bola (4.17) correspond to the two asymptotes y = b
ax and y = −b
ax of the Euclidean
hyperbola (4.16), respectively.
The equation of the unit circle x2 + y2 = 1 passes over to the equation
x2 + y2 = z2,
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
(x, y, z) ̸= (0, 0, 0, 0),
in homogeneous coordinates. Letting z = 0, the equation x2 + y2 = 0 implies
x = y = 0. Consequently, the unit circle does not contain any inﬁnite points, as
expected.
Generalization. Let n = 1, 2, . . . Using the real Hilbert space X := Rn+1 and
the notation introduced in Sect. 4.3.3, set Pn := P(Rn+1). Generalizing the relation
(4.15), we get the following bijections:
Pn ≃(Rn+1)×/R× ≃G1(Rn+1) ≃S(Rn+1)/{1, −1}.
In algebraic geometry, one always uses projective spaces in order to get elegant
results of great generality for algebraic curves. As an example, we mention the
theorem of Max Noether (1844–1921) on the genus of an irreducible algebraic curve.

4.3.5 Complex Projective Spaces
The projective complex line P1
C. For two nonzero points (w, z) and (w′, z′) in
the space C2, we write
(w, z) ∼(w′, z′)
iﬀthere exists a nonzero complex number λ such that (w, z) = λ(w′, z′). This is an
equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are denoted by P(C2) (or brieﬂy by
P1
C). The set P1
C has the complex dimension one. Therefore, it is called the projective
complex line. The group U(1) acts on the unit sphere S(C2) by (w, z) →λ(w, z)
with λ ∈U(1). There exists the bijection
P1
C ≃S(C2)/U(1)
between P1
C and the orbit space S(C2)/U(1). In 1931, Heinz Hopf discovered that
there exists a bijective map
h : S(C2)/U(1) →S2
which is called the Hopf map (or the Hopf ﬁbration). This map allows an elegant
interpretation in terms of the electron spin (see Sect. 5.7.2 of Vol. I). In particu-
lar, the Hopf map tells us that the space of quantum states of a two-dimensional

Hilbert space is bijective to the 2-dimensional sphere. By the Hopf map, we have
the bijection

C ≃S2.
The n-dimensional complex projective space. For n = 1, 2, . . ., choose the
Hilbert space X := Cn+1. By (4.14), we have the bijections
P(Cn+1) ≃(Cn+1)×/C× ≃S(Cn+1)/U(1).
The space P(Cn+1) is also brieﬂy denoted by the symbol Pn
C, and it is called the
n-dimensional complex projective space.
4.3.6 The Shape of the Universe
The recent WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) experiment of NASA
measures the anisotropy of the radiation which was created in the universe 380 000
years after the Big Bang. Information about this experiment can be found on the
NASA homepage:
http://www.nasa.gov/home/
http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov
Furthermore, we refer to:
R. Aurich, S. Lustig, F. Steiner, and H. Then (2004), Indications about
the Shape of the Universe from the WMAP data, Phys. Rev. Lett. 94,
021301. Internet:http://arXiv.org/astro-ph/0412407

universe after WMAP, Int. J. Mod. Phys. D 13, 123–136.
Internet: http://arXiv.org/astro-ph/0302264
These papers are based on sophisticated mathematical methods from both spectral
geometry and analytic number theory, and they make use of huge computer calcu-
lations. For example, the available WMAP data exclude a completely ﬂat universe
called quintessence. In fact, the WMAP data show that the curvature of our Uni-
verse is small, but the sign of the curvature is not known today. It is possible that
our Universe is not simply connected, but it is a homogenous space X/G which has
a complicated topological structure. In order to get better information about the
true structure of our Universe, one needs more precise experimental data. Such im-
proved experiments are planned for the near future by using the European Planck
satellite. The papers quoted above can be viewed as cosmological versions of the
following classical papers:
M. Kac, Can one hear the shape of a drum? Amer. Math. Monthly 73(4),
(1966), 1–23.
C. Gordon, D. Webb, and S. Volpert, You can’t hear the shape of a drum,
Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 27(1) (1992), 134–138.
C. Gordon and D. Webb, You can’t here the shape of a drum, American
Scientist 84 (1996), 46–55.
The last two papers tell us that the observed eigenfrequencies of a drum (i.e., the
eigenvalues of the Laplacian on a compact Riemannian manifold) do not always
uniquely determine the manifold, up to isometries.
Hints for further reading. The 1872 Klein Erlangen program on the rela-
tion between geometry and symmetry was substantially generalized to diﬀerential
geometry by ´Elie Cartan (1859–1951) in the 1920s. We recommend the following
monographs:

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
Though I travelled many diﬀerent roads, I always encountered analysis
situs (topology).
Henri Poincar´e (1854–1912)
Topology has its roots in geometric intuition, the theory of analytic func-
tions, the theory of Abelian integrals over algebraic functions, and in
physics.
Folklore
4.4.1 Topological Quotient Spaces
In this Section, we need the notions ‘topological space’ and ‘topology’ introduced
in Sect. 5.5 of Vol. I.
Quotient topology. Let X be a topological space. Suppose that we are given
an equivalence relation ∼on X. We have the canonical projection
π : X →X/ ∼
(4.18)
given by π(x) := [x]. We want to equip the quotient space X/ ∼of equivalence
classes [x] with a natural topology. To this end, we deﬁne:
A subset S of the quotient space X/ ∼is called open iﬀthe set of all the
corresponding representatives is open in the original space X.
In other words, a subset S of X/ ∼is called open iﬀthe set
π−1(S) is an open subset of X.
Then the map π from (4.18) has the obvious property that the pre-images of open
sets are again open. Thus, π is continuous.
Examples. Topological quotient spaces are everywhere in mathematics and physics.
Let us consider a few simple examples.

Fig. 4.6. The circle as the quotient space of an interval
(i) The unit circle as a quotient space of the unit interval: Consider the unit interval
I := [0, 1]. We equip the set I with the subspace topology induced by the
topology on the real line R. Explicitly, a subset O′ of I is called open iﬀthere
exists an open subset O of the real line such that
O′ = O ∩I.
For example, the sets [0, ε[ and ]1 −ε, 1] are open in I if 0 < ε ≤1
2. Now we
want to identify the endpoints A := {0} and B := {1} of the interval I with
each other (Fig. 4.6). Intuitively, we glue the points A and B together. This
yields a circle. In terms of mathematics, we start with the decomposition
I = {0, 1} ∪
[
0<x<1
{x}
of the interval I into pairwise disjoint sets. These sets are the equivalence
classes of the corresponding equivalence relation ∼. Explicitly, the equivalence
classes are the following subsets oﬀthe interval I:
[0] = [1] := {0, 1}
and
[x] := {x}
for all
x ∈]0, 1[.
Choose 0 < ε ≤1
2, and set Uε := [0, ε[ ∪]1 −ε, 1]. Then, for example, the set
Uε := {[x] :
x ∈Uε}
is an open neighborhood of the point [0] in the quotient space I/ ∼. The
quotient space I/ ∼is homeomorphic to the unit circle S1.
(ii) The 2-dimensional sphere as a quotient space of the unit square: Consider the
unit square
S := {(x, y) ∈R2 : 0 ≤x, y ≤1},
and identify all of the boundary points with each other. Intuitively, we glue all
of the boundary points together (Fig. 4.7). The corresponding quotient space
S/ ∼is homeomorphic to the 2-dimensional unit sphere S2.
(iii) The torus as the quotient space of a square: In contrast to example (ii), we
only identify opposite boundary points of the unit square S with each other.
The corresponding quotient space S/ ∼is homeomorphic to a 2-dimensional
torus (Fig. 4.8).
(iv) The n-dimensional sphere as the quotient space of the n-dimensional cube: Let
n = 1, 2, . . . Consider the n-dimensional unit cube
In := {(x1, . . . , xn) ∈Rn : 0 ≤x1 ≤. . . ≤xn ≤1},
and identify all of the boundary points with each other. Then the corresponding
quotient space In/ ∼is homeomorphic to the n-dimensional unit sphere Sn.

x = ±y.
The corresponding quotient space Sn/{±I} becomes a topological space with
respect to the quotient topology. Since we have the bijection
Sn/{±I} ≃Pn,
the n-dimensional real projective space Pn also becomes a topological space.
(vi) Orbit spaces: Example (v) is a special case of the following more general sit-
uation. Let X be a topological space, and suppose that the symmetry group
G acts on X. By Sect. 4.3.2, there exists an equivalence relation on X such
that the quotient space X/ ∼coincides with the orbit space X/G. Using the
quotient topology, the orbit space X/G becomes a topological space.
(vii) The Gaussian plane factorized by a lattice: Consider the lattice
L := {z ∈C : z = m + ni, m, n ∈Z}.
This lattice is generated from the origin z = 0 by repeating the following
translations: z →z + 1, z →z + i, z →z −1, and z →z −i. For the points
z, w in the complex plane C, we write
z ∼w
iﬀ
z −w ∈L.
The corresponding quotient space C/L is homeomorphic to the quotient space
S/ ∼from (iii) above, and hence it is homeomorphic to a 2-dimensional torus
T. Let f : C →C be a meromorphic function with the periods 1 and i, that is,
f(z + w) = f(z)
for all
w ∈L.
Then the function f can be considered as a function of the form f : C/L →C.
In turn, this induces a function
f : T →C
on the torus T. This was the basic idea of Riemann in order to reduce the
study of elliptic functions (and of the corresponding Abelian integrals) to the
investigation of the topological properties of a torus.

4.4.2 Physical Fields, Observers, Bundles, and Cocycles
Physical ﬁelds can be described by bundles in mathematics. The change
of the real values measured by diﬀerent observers corresponds to cocyles.
Folklore
We want to show how the modern mathematical language of bundles ﬁts physics
in a quite natural way. The point is that we have to model mathematically the
following situation:
• Three observers measure the same physical eﬀect.
• The transformation laws between the measured quantities are governed by the
fact that physics has an invariant meaning; this means, that physics is indepen-
dent of the speciﬁc observers.
This corresponds to the situation in geometry where invariant geometric objects
(e.g., a sphere) are described by diﬀerent local coordinate systems.
Prototype. Let y = f(x) be a real function as pictured in Fig. 4.9. The subset
graph(f) := {(x, f(x)) ∈R2 : x ∈R}
of R2 is called the graph of the map f : R →R. We want to reformulate f as the
section of a ﬁber bundle. To this end, we introduce the surjective map
π : R2 →R
given by π(x, y) := x. The map π is called the projection from the bundle space R2
onto the base space R. The pre-image π−1(x) is called the ﬁber Fx at the point x
of the base space R. Explicitly,
Fx = {(x, y) ∈R2 :
y ∈R}.
Therefore, Fx ≃R for all x ∈R, in the sense of a bijection. Here, R is called the
typical ﬁber. If x ̸= x′, then Fx ̸= Fx′. Thus, we have the disjoint decomposition
R2 =
[
x∈R
Fx
of the bundle space R2 into ﬁbers. Set s(x) := (x, f(x)). The map
s : R →R2
has the property that s(x) ∈Fx for all x ∈R. This map is called a section of
the bundle. This is the desired equivalent formulation of the given function f. The
family {Fx}x∈R is called a pre-bundle.
Unstructured ﬁber bundle. By deﬁnition, each surjective map
π : B →X
(4.19)
is called an unstructured ﬁber bundle, in contrast to topological and smooth ﬁber
bundles to be considered below. Here, we use the following terminology:

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
209
• the set B is called the bundle space,
• the set X is called the base space,
• the map π is called the bundle projection, and
• the pre-image Fx := π−1(x) is called the ﬁber over the base point x.
The map s : X →B is called a section iﬀthe diagram

bundle projection π).
Bundle morphism. By deﬁnition, a morphism between the bundles
π : B →X
and
σ : C →Y
is a pair (f, g) of mappings such that the following diagram is commutative:
B


f
 C

 Y.
(4.21)
This implies that ﬁbers are preserved. Explicitly, we have the induced maps
f : Fx →Fg(x)
for all
x ∈X.
The bundle morphism (4.21) is called a bundle isomorphism iﬀthe maps f and g
are bijective.
Pre-bundles and physical ﬁelds. By deﬁnition, a pre-bundle is a family
{Fx}x∈X
of sets Fx (e.g., linear spaces, groups, rings) indexed by the set X. In terms of
physics, the points x are events which are elements of the space-time X (i.e., x
describes a position in space at a certain time). The points of the pre-ﬁber Fx
describe additional degrees of freedom of the physical system at the event x. The
family
{ψ(x)}x∈X
is called a pre-section iﬀψ(x) ∈Fx for all x ∈X. In terms of physics, this describes
a physical ﬁeld x →ψ(x) which depends on space and time.
Proposition 4.14 Each pre-bundle corresponds to a bundle. Here, the pre-ﬁbers
are bijectively equivalent to the ﬁbers of the bundle, and the pre-sections correspond
to sections of the bundle.
Proof. We deﬁne the bundle space B as the coproduct
B :=
a
x∈X
Fx

210
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
of the pre-ﬁbers Fx. Explicitly, B = {(x, y) :
x ∈X, y ∈Fx}.18 The bundle
projection
π : B →X
is given by π(x, y) := x. The ﬁber Fx over the base point x is equal to
Fx = π−1(x) = {x} × Fx.
Set ix(y) := (x, y). For each base point x ∈X, the map
ix : Fx →B
is injective with the image ix(Fx) = Fx. This induces the bijection
ix : Fx →Fx
between the pre-ﬁber Fx and the ﬁber Fx. Set s(x) := ix(ψ(x)). Then the map
s : X →B is a section of the bundle.
2
Operations with pre-bundles. Our general strategy reads as follows:
Operations between pre-ﬁber bundles are performed with respect to ﬁbers.
For example, let {Fx}x∈X and {Gx}x∈X be pre-ﬁber bundles where all the ﬁbers Fx
and Gx are real ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces. For linear spaces, we have the direct
sum Fx ⊕Gx and the tensor product Fx ⊗Gx at hand.19 This leads immediately to
the operations
{Fx}x∈X ⊕{Gx}x∈X := {Fx ⊕Gx}x∈X
and
{Fx}x∈X ⊗{Gx}x∈X := {Fx ⊗Gx}x∈X.
We call {Fx}x∈X a pre-subbundle of {Gx}x∈X iﬀeach ﬁber Fx is a linear subspace
of the ﬁber Gx. Finally, a morphism from {Fx}x∈X to {Gy}y∈Y is deﬁned to be
both a map g : X →Y and a family
{Lx}x∈X
of linear maps Lx : Fx →Gy with y = g(x) for all x ∈X. This morphism is called
an isomorphism iﬀall the maps Lx are linear isomorphisms and g is bijective.
Next it is our goal to equip ﬁber bundles π : B →X with an additional
structure.
For example, π is a continuous or smooth map. This way, we will get topological
and smooth ﬁber bundles, respectively.
Product bundle. Let X and F be sets. The simplest bundle is a product
bundle which corresponds to the surjective map
π : X × F →X
where π(x, y) := x. The ﬁber over the base point x ∈X is given by
Fx := π−1(x) = {x} × F.
The set F is called the typical ﬁber. Product bundles are called trivial bundles.
Now we want to construct nontrivial bundles.
Roughly speaking, the idea is to glue trivial bundles together.
18 The coproduct is also called the disjoint union.
19 For example, Rn ⊕Rm = Rn+m and Rn ⊗Rm = Rnm.

Vector bundle. Let n = 1, 2, . . . Consider the following situation.
(V1) Topological bundle: The map π : B →X is surjective and continuous where
the bundle space B and the base space X are topological spaces.
(V2) Linear ﬁbers: For each x ∈X, the ﬁber Fx := π−1(x) carries the structure of
a real n-dimensional linear space.
(V3) Local triviality: The bundle behaves locally like a trivial product bundle
Uα × Rn.
More precisely, there exists a covering {Uα} of the base space X by open sets
Uα. For each index α, we have a homeomorphism
χα :
[
x∈Uα
Fx →Uα × Rn
(4.22)
which preserves the linear ﬁbers. That is, all the maps
Fx
χα
−→{x} × Rn
p
−→Rn
are linear isomorphisms from Fx onto Rn. Here, p(x, y) := y.
If the conditions (V1)–(V3) are satisﬁed, then the bundle π : B →X is called a
real vector bundle of rank n. A map s : B →X is called a section of the vector
bundle iﬀthe map s is continuous, and we have the commutative diagram (4.20).
By deﬁnition, a morphism (resp. isomorphism) from the vector bundle
π : B →X
to the vector bundle σ : C →Y is a pair (f, g) of continuous maps (resp. homeomor-
phisms) f : B →C and g : X →Y such that the diagram (4.21) is commutative.
Then the map f is ﬁber-preserving. In addition, we postulate that the linear struc-
ture of the ﬁbers is respected. That is, all the induced ﬁber maps
f : Fx →Fg(x),
x ∈X
are linear morphisms (resp. linear isomorphisms).
Smooth vector bundle. The vector bundle introduced above is called smooth
iﬀwe replace the topological spaces (resp. continuous maps) by manifolds (resp.
smooth maps). In other words, we replace the category of topological spaces by the
category of manifolds.
Standard example (velocity ﬁeld on a sphere and the tangent bundle).
Consider the unit sphere S2 (Fig. 4.10). In order to describe a continuous velocity
ﬁeld
v = v(P)
on the sphere, we need the quite natural notion of the tangent bundle. Intuitively,
think of an ocean which covers a planet; the velocity ﬁeld describes the velocity
vectors of the ﬂuid particles. Note that the velocity vector v(P) is an element of
the tangent space TP S2 of the sphere S2 at the point P. It is our goal to show that:

212
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
A continuous velocity ﬁeld on the sphere is a section of the tangent bundle
of the sphere.
By deﬁnition, the tangent bundle TS2 of the sphere S2 consists of all the pairs
{(P, v) : P ∈S2, v ∈TP S2}.
In other words, the tangent bundle TS2 is the set of all pairs (P, v) where P is an
arbitrary point of the sphere, and v is an arbitrary tangent vector of the sphere at
the point P. Setting π(P, v) := P, we get the vector bundle
π : TS2 →S2.
The ﬁber FP over the point P ∈S2 is the tangent space TP S2 at the point P.
In order to prove local triviality, we will introduce local coordinates in a natural
way. Let {Uα} be a covering of the sphere S2 by nonempty open sets Uα which are
diﬀerent from S2. Fix the set Uα. Then there exist two continuous tangent vector
ﬁelds v1 = v1(P) and v2 = v2(P) on Uα such that v1(P), v2(P) is a basis of the
tangent space TP S2 at each point P ∈Uα. Therefore, each tangent vector v at the
point P ∈Uα can be represented in the form
v = v1(P)v1(P) + v2(P)v2(P).
The tuple v1(P), v2(P) of real numbers represents the local coordinates of the
tangent vector v with respect to Uα. The map
χα :
[
P ∈Uα
TP S2 →Uα × R2
from (V3) above is given by χα(P, v) := {P} × (v1(P), v2(P)).
A section s : S2 →TS2 of the tangent bundle is nothing else than a continuous
tangent vector ﬁeld on the sphere. Observe that it is not possible to introduce a
global coordinate system on the sphere. In fact, Poincar´e proved the crucial fact in
1885 that:
Every continuous tangent vector ﬁeld on the sphere S2 vanishes at some
point.
For the proof based on the mapping degree, we refer to Zeidler (1986), Vol. I, p. 558
(see the references on page 1049). Let n = 1, 2, . . . A sphere Sn is called parallelizable
iﬀthere exist n continuous tangent vector ﬁelds of the sphere S2 which are linearly
independent at each point of the sphere. A fundamental theorem of topology tells
us the following:20
Precisely the spheres S1, S3, S7 are parallelizable.
This is a special case of the theorem of Adams on page 233. Tangent bundles play
a fundamental role in describing the mechanics of point particles by position and
velocity. This will be studied in Chap. 6.
The sphere is not only a topological space, but a 2-dimensional real manifold.
This means that it looks locally like an open subset of R2, and the change of local
coordinates is given by diﬀeomorphisms (see Sect. 5.4 of Vol. I). Using local manifold
coordinates for the points of the sphere, and describing the tangent vectors in terms
of these local coordinates, the tangent bundle becomes a smooth vector bundle. The

page 235.

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
213
sections of the smooth tangent bundle TS2 are precisely the smooth velocity ﬁelds
P →v(P) on the sphere S2.
Bundle charts, observers, and transition maps. Let us discuss the maps
(4.22) in terms of observers. We want to show that this is intimately related to the
notion of cocycle which is of fundamental importance for topology. The map
χα :
[
x∈Uα
Fx →Uα × Rn
is called a bundle chart. This map assigns to the point P ∈Fx on the bundle space
B the local bundle coordinate
(x, yα(P))
with
x ∈Uα, yα(P) ∈Rn.
In terms of physics, an observer Oα (corresponding to Uα and χα) measures the
value yα(P) at the space-time point x. Now suppose that
x ∈Uα ∩Uβ,
and consider a second observer Oβ (corresponding to Uβ and χβ). Then the point
P ∈Fx of the bundle space B is also described by the local bundle coordinate
(x, yβ(P))
with
x ∈Uβ, yβ(P) ∈Rn.
The change of local coordinates
yβ(P) = Tβα(x)yα(P)
is given by the real invertible (n × n)-matrix Tβα(x), that is, Tβα(x) ∈GL(n, R).
The map
Tβα : Uα ∪Uβ →GL(n, R)
is called the transition map of the bundle from the observer Oα to the observer
Oβ (corresponding to the pair (Uα, Uβ) of open subsets of the base space X). The
change of observers corresponds to the following commutative diagram
Oβ
Tγβ

Oα
Tβα

Tγα

Oγ
(4.23)
For all indices α, β, γ, the following three conditions are satisﬁed:
(C1) Tαα(x) = id for all x ∈Uα.
(C2) Tαβ(x) = Tβα(x)−1 for all x ∈Uα ∩Uβ.
(C3) Tγα(x) = Tγβ(x)Tβα(x) for all x ∈Uα ∩Uβ ∩Uγ.
This allows the following quite natural interpretation in terms of observers. Condi-
tion (C2) tells us that yα(P) = Tβα(x)−1yβ(P). Furthermore, condition (C3) corre-
sponds to the commutativity of the diagram (4.23). Explicitly, if x ∈Uα ∩Uβ ∩Uγ,
then yγ(P) = Tγα(x)yα(P), and
yγ(P) = Tγβ(x)yβ(P) = Tγβ(x)Tβα(x)yα(P).
This implies (C3).
Observers, cocycles, and the construction of bundles. By deﬁnition, a
cocycle on the topological space X with values in the group G consists of

214
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
• a covering {Uα}α∈A of the space X by open subsets Uα and
• a family of continuous maps Tβα : Uα ∩Uβ →such that the conditions (C1)–(C3)
are satisﬁed for all indices α, β, γ ∈A.
The proof of the following theorem shows that cocycles play a decisive role in de-
scribing all kind of physical ﬁelds by observers. In mathematics, it was discovered by
ˆCech (1893–1960) in the 1930s that cocycles can be used in topology for constructing
the so-called ˆCech cohomology. In modern mathematics, one uses a generalization
of ˆCech cohomology on arbitrary topological spaces called cohomology with values
in a pre-sheaf. This general approach dates back to Leray (1906–1998) in the late
1940s.
Theorem 4.15 Suppose that we are given the topological space X and a cocycle
{Tβα} on X with values in the group GL(n, R), n = 1, 2, . . . Then there exists
a vector bundle π : B →X with typical ﬁber Rn which corresponds to the given
cocycle.
Proof. (I) The bundle space B. The proof is strongly motivated by the physical
picture of observers. We start with the coproduct
B :=
a
α∈A
Uα × Rn.
Explicitly, B := {(α, x; vα) : α ∈A, x ∈Uα, vα ∈Rn}. For the elements of B, we
write
(α, x, vα) ∼(β, y, vβ)
iﬀwe have x ∈Uα, y ∈Uβ, x = y and vβ = Tβαvα. Because of the cocycle property,
this is an equivalence relation on B. By deﬁnition, the corresponding equivalence
classes [(α, x, vα)] form the bundle space B. Brieﬂy,
B := B/ ∼.
Naturally enough, the bundle projection π : B →X is deﬁned by
π([α, x, vα]) := x.
Intuitively, the equivalence class [(α, x, vα)] describes the physical ﬁeld v at the
event (space-time point) x by the values of the ﬁeld measured by diﬀerent observers.
(II) Topology of the bundle space B. We say that the subset O of B is open iﬀ,
for each point [(α, x, vα)] of the set O, there exist
• an open subset Oα of the base space X with x ∈Oα ⊆Uα and
• an open subset V of the typical ﬁber Rn with vα ∈V
such that
[(α, y, w)] ⊆Oα
for all
(y, w) ∈Oα × V.
One checks in a straightforward manner that this deﬁnition of the open set O does
not depend on the choice of the representatives in the bundle charts Uα × Rn. This
way, the bundle space B becomes a topological space, and the bundle projection
π : B →X is continuous.
2
The preceding proof tells us that, for n = 1, 2, . . . , the following hold:
There exists a one-to-one correspondence between real vector bundles of
rank n on the topological space X and cocycles on X with values in the
group GL(n, R).

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
215
In terms of physics, this corresponds to the relation between the invariant formula-
tion of physical ﬁelds and the coordinate formulation based on the transformation
laws between diﬀerent observers.
Operations with vector bundles. In Sect. 3.2, we have studied operations
for linear spaces and linear operators. In a quite natural way, all of these operations
can be translated to vector bundles. Since the ﬁbers are linear spaces, the simple
strategy is to perform the operations with respect to the ﬁbers. This can be easily
done
• by using the corresponding operations for the typical ﬁbers,
• by applying the corresponding operations to the cocycles, and
• by constructing the bundle space via Theorem 4.15.
Let us discuss this. We are given the two real vector bundles V and W of ﬁnite
rank with
• the bundle projections π : B →X and σ : C →X,
• the ﬁbers Fx and Gx,
• the typical ﬁbers Rm and Rn, and
• the cocycles Sαβ : Uα ∪Uβ →GL(m, R) and Tαβ : Uα ∪Uβ →GL(n, R),
respectively.
First we assume that the two vector bundles V and W refer to the same open
covering {Uα} of the base space X.
(i) Cartesian product: We want to construct the vector bundle V × W with the
ﬁbers Fx × Gx for all x ∈X. To this end, we use the typical ﬁber Rm × Rn and
the cocycle Sαβ × Tαβ. Explicitly,
(Sαβ × Tαβ)(x)(v, w) = (Sαβ(x)v, Tαβ(x)w).
One checks easily that indeed the Cartesian product Sαβ × Tαβ of cocycles
yields again a cocycle.
(ii) Direct sum: In order to construct the vector bundle V ⊕W with the ﬁbers
Fx ⊕Gx for all x ∈X, we use the typical ﬁber Rm ⊕Rn and the cocycle
Sαβ ⊕Tαβ.
(iii) Tensor product: The tensor product V ⊗W with the ﬁbers Fx ⊗Gx for all
x ∈X is obtained by using the typical ﬁber Rm⊗Rn and the cocycle Sαβ ⊗Tαβ.
If the vector bundles V and W refer to the open coverings {Uα} and {Vβ} of the base
space X, then we apply the construction above to the common covering consisting
of all the intersections Uα ∩Vβ. Finally, it is not diﬃcult to show that the following
hold where the symbol ≃stands for bundle isomorphims: If V ≃V and W ≃W,
then
V × W ≃V × W.
The same is true for V ⊕W and V ⊗W. Therefore, the constructions above do not
depend on the open coverings of the base space X, but only on the isomorphism
classes of the vector bundles.
Generalizations. We have restricted ourselves to real vector bundles. The
same arguments apply to complex vector bundles with the typical ﬁber Cn. If we
use the replacements
topological space
⇒manifold,
continuous map ⇒
smooth map,
(4.24)
then we get the notion of smooth vector bundles. The cocycles are then smooth
maps. The same arguments apply to more general bundles (e.g., principal ﬁber
bundles, where the ﬁbers are Lie groups).

216
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
Modern diﬀerential geometry is based on the idea of parallel transport in
bundles.
This allows us to introduce the notion of curvature. In fact, this represents the
mathematics of the Standard Model in elementary physics for describing the fun-
damental forces in nature. The prototype is the Levi-Civita parallel transport of
velocity ﬁelds on a sphere (see Vol. III).
4.4.3 Generalized Physical Fields and Sheaves
During World War II, the French mathematician Jean Leray (1906–1998)
was a prisoner of war from 1940 to 1945. He organized a university in
his prison camp and himself gave a course on algebraic topology, a ﬁeld he
had become interested in connection with his collaboration with the Polish
mathematician Juliusz Schauder (1899–1943) on applications of degree
theory in nonlinear functional analysis.21 Leray became dissatisﬁed both
with the methods using triangulations and with those using inverse or
direct limits (introduced by ˇCech (1893-1960) in the 1930s). In 1942 he
published a series of four Notes in the Comptes rendus (of the French
Academy of Sciences) outlining a new and original way of deﬁning and
studying cohomology . . .
In May 1946 Leray published two Notes in the Comptes rendus in which he
introduced for the ﬁrst time the notions of sheaf, sheaf cohomology, and of
spectral sequence. In retrospect, it is diﬃcult to exaggerate the importance
of these concepts, which very rapidly became not only powerful tools in
algebraic topology, but spread to many other parts of mathematics, some
of which seem very remote from topology, such as algebraic geometry,
number theory, and mathematical logic. These applications certainly went
far beyond the wildest dreams of the inventor of these notions, and they
undoubtedly rank at the same level in the history of mathematics as the
methods invented by Poincar´e (1854–1912) and Brouwer (1881–1966) in
classical topology.22
Jean Dieudonn´e, 1989
Let X be an arbitrary set, and let R be a ring. In order to study the structure of
the set X, one can study the space of all the mappings
f : X →R.
In terms of physics, the mapping f can be regarded as a physical ﬁeld on the space
X (e.g., a space-time manifold) with values in the ring R. For mathematics and
21 In 1930 Schauder published the famous Schauder ﬁxed-point theorem: The ﬁxed-
point theorem in function spaces, Studia Math. 2 (1930), 171–180 (in German).
In 1936, Leray and Schauder created the fundamental Leray–Schauder degree
theory for solving nonlinear operator equations (e.g., nonlinear partial diﬀerential
equations and integral equations) in inﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces. This is
thoroughly studied in Zeidler (1986), Vol. I (see the references on page 1049).
In 1943, Juliusz Schauder and his wife were killed by the German occupation
army in Poland.

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology

physics, it is important to generalize this concept in the following way. Let X be a
topological space with topology T . Recall that T denotes the family of open subsets
of X.
We assign to each set U ∈T a ring R(U).
This leads us to the concept of pre-sheaves and sheaves to be studied in later
volumes.
Analytic functions and sheaves. The prototype of a sheaf is given by ana-
lytic functions on open subsets of the Gaussian plane X := C. Let T (C) denote the
family of open subsets of C (e.g., an open disc). We assign to each U ∈T (C) the
ring R(U) of all holomorphic functions
f : U →C.
Suppose that we are given arbitrary open sets
U, V, W ∈T (C)
with
W ⊆V ⊆U.
By deﬁnition, the map rU,V : R(U) →R(V ) assigns to each holomorphic function
f : U →C its restriction rU,V (f) : V →C to the set V . Then the following hold:
(S1) The following diagram is commutative:
R(U)



R(W).
(4.25)
All of the mappings rU,V , rV,W , rU,W are ring morphisms.
(S2) rUU = id.
Moreover, we have the following stronger properties which are closely related to
analytic continuation. Let U be an open subset of X, and let U1, U2, . . . be a family
of open subsets of X with
U =
[
j∈J
Uj
where the index set J is a ﬁnite or inﬁnite set of positive integers.
(S3) The local-global principle: If f, g ∈R(U), then
rU,Uj(f) = rU,Uj(g)
for all j ∈J
implies
f = g on U.
(S4) The gluing condition: If fj ∈R(Uj) for all j ∈J and we have
rUj,Uj∩Uk(fj) = rUk,Uj∩Uk(fk)
for all
j, k ∈J,
then there exists precisely one f ∈R(U) such that
r(U, Uj)(f) = fj
for all
j ∈J.
The conditions (S1), (S2) (resp. (S1)–(S4)) are characteristic for pre-sheaves (resp.
sheaves).
Germs. Consider a ﬁxed point x0 ∈X. Let T (x0) be the set of all the open
subsets U of X which contain the point x0. For f ∈R(U) and g ∈R(V ) we write
f ∼g

218
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
iﬀf and g coincide on a suﬃciently small neighborhood of the point x0. More
precisely, we assume that U, V ∈T (x0) and that there exists a set W ∈T (x0) with
W ⊆U ∩V and the property
rU,W (f) = rV,W (g).
This is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are called germs of the
pre-sheaf at the point x0.
Example. In the special case of the sheaf of holomorphic functions on the
Gaussian plane C, two holomorphic functions
f : U →C
and g : V →C belong to the same germ at the point z0 iﬀthey have the same power
series expansion near the point z0. In this case, the famous local-global principle of
the theory of analytic functions tells us the crucial fact that the functions f and
g have the same global analytic continuation. In particular, they have the same
Riemann surface.
The pre-sheaf of smooth functions. Let X be a manifold (e.g., a real ﬁnite-
dimensional linear space or a sphere). We assign to each open subset of X the ring
R(U) of smooth functions f : U →R. Then the conditions (S1) and (S2) above are
satisﬁed. This way, we get the pre-sheaf C∞
sheaf(X) of smooth functions of X. Two
smooth functions
f : U →C
and g : V →C belong to the same germ at the point x0 ∈X iﬀthey have the
same values and the same derivatives of each order at the point x0. Let C∞
x0,germ(X)
denote the set of germs at the point x0.
In contrast to germs of holomorphic functions, germs of smooth functions
do not determine the global properties of smooth functions.
Historical remarks. It turns out that the language of pre-sheaves and sheaves
is of fundamental importance for mathematics. In the 1950s, Jean Leray (1906–
1998), Henri Cartan (born 1904), and Jean-Piere Serre (born 1926) showed that
the theory of holomorphic functions of several variables can elegantly be formulated
in terms of the cohomology of sheaves. In the 1950s and 1960s, Arthur Wightman
and Res Jost emphasized the importance of the theory of holomorphic functions
with several variables in axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory. In the 1960s, Alexandre
Grothendieck (born 1928) based algebraic geometry and number theory on the new
concept of schemes. Here, schemes are closely related to sheaf theory.

and its applications, we refer to Chapter 19 of the handbook edited by Zeidler,

4.4.4 Deformations, Mapping Classes, and Topological Charges
Two continuous mappings are contained in the same mapping class iﬀ
they can be continuously deformed into each other. In important special
cases, the space of mapping classes can be equipped with an additional
group structure. This leads to Poincar´e’s fundamental group and the higher
homotopy groups of topological spaces.
Folklore
The space [X, Y ] of mapping classes. Let X and Y be topological spaces
(e.g., subsets of Rn). For two continuous maps f, g : X →Y , we write
f ∼g
iﬀthere exists a continuous map H : X × [0, 1] →Y with
H(x, 0) = f(x)
and
H(x, 1) = g(x)
for all
x ∈X.
This is an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes [f] are called mapping
classes. They form the space [X, Y ] of mapping classes from X to Y .
It is an important task of topology to describe the structure of mapping
classes.
This structure is only known for a collection of special cases. Mathematicians are
looking for ever stronger tools in order to get new information about mapping
classes. The crucial map
(x, t) →H(x, t)
is called a homotopy between the mappings f and g. Intuitively, the mappings f
and g can be viewed as physical ﬁelds, and the homotopy H deforms
• the physical ﬁeld f at the initial time t = 0
• into the physical ﬁeld g at the ﬁnal time t = 1.
The deformed value of f(x) at time t is equal to H(x, t). If f ∼g, then we also say
that f is homotopically equivalent to g.

220
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
m > 0 (resp. m < 0), then we observe a clockwise (resp. counter-clockwise) winding.
Each continuous map f : S1 →S1 is homotopically equivalent precisely to one map
χm. The number m is called the mapping degree deg(f) (or the winding number)
of the map f.23 Therefore, the mapping f →deg(f) yields the bijection
[S1, S1] ≃Z.
(ii) The space [S2, S2]. Example (i) can be generalized to higher-dimensional
spheres. Using spherical coordinates, we deﬁne the continuous map f : S2 →S2 by
setting
χm(ϕ, ϑ) := (mϕ, ϑ)
for all
ϕ ∈R, ϑ ∈[−π
2 , π
2 ].
Each continuous map f : S2 →S2 is homotopically equivalent precisely to one map
χm. The integer m is called the mapping degree deg(f) (or the winding number)
of the map f. The mapping f →deg(f) yields the bijection
[S2, S2] ≃Z.
More generally, there holds the bijection
[Sn, Sn] ≃Z,
n = 1, 2, . . .
(4.26)
This theorem is due to Heinz Hopf. In physics, the mapping degree deg(f) is called
the topological charge of the physical ﬁeld f. Analytic formulas for computing the
mapping degree by means of the so-called Kronecker integral can be found in Sect.
5.7.3 of Vol. I.
(iii) We have the bijection
[S3, S2] ≃Z.
This famous theorem due to Heinz Hopf is closely related to both the electron spin
in physics and the Hopf ﬁbration of the 3-dimensional sphere in mathematics (see
Sect. 5.7.2 of Vol. I).
(iv) The space [S0, X]: Two points x and y of a topological space X are called
arcwise connected iﬀthere exists a continuous map c : [0, 1] →X with
c(0) = x
and
c(1) = y.
Intuitively, the two points are connected by the continuous curve c. This is an
equivalence relation. The equivalence classes are called the path components of the
topological space X. Let S0 denote the 0-dimensional sphere (i.e., the point 0 on the
real line). The topological space X is called arcwise connected iﬀit has precisely
one path component.
There exists a bijection between the space of mapping classes [S0, X] and
the set of path components of the topological space X.
For example, the interval [0, 1] is arcwise connected, but the set
[0, 1] ∪[2, 3] ∪[4, 5]
23 The general theory of mapping degree for mappings on ﬁnite-dimensional and
inﬁnite-dimensional Banach spaces is thoroughly studied in the author’s mono-
graph on ﬁxed-point theory, Zeidler (1986), Vol. I (see the references on page
1049), including the Hopf theorem (4.26).

Fig. 4.11. Deformation retracts
has three path components. Furthermore, the space Rn is arcwise connected. Hence
we have the bijection
[S0, Rn] = {0},
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
The set R2 \ S1 has two path components (namely, the interior and the exterior of
the unit circle). Therefore, we have the bijections
[S0, R2 \ S1] ≃{0, 1} ≃Z2.
Let C be a Jordan curve in R2 (i.e., C is a subset of R2 which is homeomorphic to
S1). The classical Jordan curve theorem tells us that the set R2 \ C has two path
components.24 Therefore, we have the bijection
[S0, R2 \ C] ≃Z2.
Deformation retracts. Let Y be a subspace of the topological space X (i.e, Y
is a subset of X equipped with the subspace topology – see page 243). By deﬁnition,
Y is a retract of X iﬀthere exists a continuous map
r : X →Y
with r(y) = y for all y ∈Y. The map r is called a retraction. Furthermore, Y is
called a deformation retract of X iﬀthere exists a continuous map
H : X × [0, 1] →X
such that the following hold:
• H(x, 0) = x for all x ∈X,
• H(x, 1) ∈Y for all x ∈X, and
• H(y, 1) = y for all y ∈Y.
This means that the identity map on X (at time t = 0) can be continuously de-
formed into a retraction H(. , 1) : X →Y (at time t = 1). For example,
• the midpoint of a disc is a deformation retract of the disc,
• and a ﬁxed boundary circle of an annulus is a deformation retract of the annulus
(Fig. 4.11).
Topologically equivalent topological spaces. Two topological spaces X and
Y are called topologically equivalent iﬀthere exists a homoemorphism
f : X →Y.
Explicitly, this means that the map f : X →Y is continuous and bijective, and the
inverse map f −1 : Y →X is also continuous. We also say that X and Y have the
same topological type iﬀthey are topologically equivalent.

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
Now let us introduce the weaker notion of homotopically equivalent topological
spaces. Observe that topologically equivalent topological spaces are also homotopi-
cally equivalent, but the conserve is not always true. For example, the interval [0, 1]
is topologically equivalent to any compact interval [a, b] of positive length, but it
is not topologically equivalent to the one-point interval {0}. However, the interval
[0, 1] is homotopically equivalent to {0}.
Homotopically equivalent topological spaces. For two topological spaces,
we write
X ∼Y
iﬀthere exist two continuous maps f : X →Y and g : Y →X such that we have
the homotopies
g ◦f ∼idX
and
f ◦g ∼idY ,
where idX and idY are the identity maps on X and Y , respectively. In other words,
the map g ◦f (resp. f ◦g) can be continuously deformed into the identity map on X
(resp. Y ). We say that f and g are inverse up to homotopy. For topological spaces
X, Y, Z, we have X ∼X. Moreover, X ∼Y iﬀY ∼X, and
X ∼Y, Y ∼Z
implies
X ∼Z.
Consequently, X ∼Y is an equivalence relation. We say that the topological spaces
X and Y are homotopically equivalent (or the have the same homotopy type) iﬀ
X ∼Y. The following deﬁnitions will be frequently used:
• X is called contractible iﬀit is homotopically equivalent to a one-point space.
Intuitively, this means that the space X can be continuously contracted into a
point.
• X is called arcwise connected iﬀthe space [S0, X] of mapping classes consists
precisely of one point. Intuitively, this means that two points of X can always
be connected by a continuous curve.
• X is called simply connected iﬀthe space [S1, X] of mapping classes consists
precisely of one point. Intuitively, this means that each closed continuous curve
in X can be continuously contracted into a point.
Examples. (i) For n = 1, 2, . . ., each convex set of Rn is contractible (e.g., an
interval, a disc in R2, or a ball in Rn).
(ii) A disc is arcwise connected and simply connected.
(iii) A circle (or an annulus) is arcwise connected, but not simply connected.
(iv) An annulus is homotopically equivalent to a circle (Fig. 4.11).
(v) If Y is a deformation retract of the topological space X, then Y and X are
homotopically equivalent.
Cyclic groups. The following notions will be used in the next section. The set
Z := {en : n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .}
is a multiplicative group called the inﬁnite cyclic group. We have the group isomor-
phism
Z ≃Z
from the additive group Z onto the multiplicative group Z. This isomorphism is
given by the map n →en. Let m = 1, 2, . . . The set
Zm := {e2πmi/k : k = 0, 1, . . . , m −1}
is a multiplicative group called the cyclic group of order m. We have the group
isomorphism
Zm ≃Zm

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
223
from the additive group Zm onto the multiplicative group Zm. This isomorphism
is given by the map
[k] →e2πim/k
where the equivalence class [k] modulo m is equal to the set k + mZ. Explicitly, we
have [k] := {k + nm : n = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .}. For example, we get
Z1 = {1},
Z2 = {1, −1},
Z3 = {1, e2πi/3, e−2πi/3},
Z4 := {1, i, −1, −i}.
The direct product of two groups. If G and H are groups, then the Carte-
sian product
G × H := {(g, h) : g ∈G, h ∈H}
becomes a group if we use the multiplication (g, h)(g+, h+) := (gg+, hh+). The
group G × H is called the direct product between the groups G and H.
4.4.5 Poincar´e’s Fundamental Group
Basic idea. Consider the unit circle S1 := {z ∈C :
|z| = 1}. Let us recall the
deﬁnition χn(ϕ) := einϕ. The space of mapping classes [S1, S1] can be equipped
with a group structure by deﬁning the multiplication
[χm][χk] := [χm+k]
for all
k, m ∈Z.
This group denoted by π1(S1) is Poincar´e’s fundamental group of the unit circle.
We have
π1(S1) = Z.
Using the group isomorphism Z ≃Z given by m →χm, we get
π1(S1) ≃Z.
Here, π1(S1) is regarded as an additive group. Let us generalize this. It turns out
that the fundamental group is a multiplicative group, which is not always commu-
tative. Therefore, the fundamental group is not always isomorphic to an additive
group.
The product of loops. Let X be an arbitrary topological space. Fix the point
x0 in X. Each continuous map
c : S1 →X
with
c(1) = x0
(4.27)
is called a loop in X with the base point x0. By deﬁnition, the set of all such loops
forms the loop space Ωx0X. Intuitively, the space Ωx0X consists of all the closed
curves in the topological space X which pass through the point x0. For two loops
c, d ∈Ωx0X, we deﬁne the product c×d by using the angular coordinate ϕ ∈[0, 2π]
and by setting
(c × d)(ϕ) :=
(
c(2ϕ)
if
0 ≤ϕ ≤π,
d(2ϕ −2π)
if
π ≤ϕ ≤2π.
Then, c × d ∈Ωx0X. Intuitively, this means that we glue the two curves together
at the point x0 (Fig. 4.12).
The fundamental group π1(X, x0). Our next goal is to identify homotopic
loops with each other. To this end, for c, d ∈Ωx0X, we write
c ∼d
mod x0

Fig. 4.12. Multiplication of two loops
iﬀthe two curves are homotopic modulo the point x0. Explicitly, this is deﬁned in
the following way: we assume that there exists a continuous map H : S1×[0, 1] →X
such that we have
H(ϕ, 0) = c(ϕ)
and
H(ϕ, 1) = d(ϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈[0, 2π]
together with H(0, t) = H(2π, t) = x0 for all times t ∈[0, 1]. This is an equivalence
relation. Intuitively, during the time interval [0, 1], the closed curve c is continuously
deformed into the closed curve d in such a way that all of the deformed curves
pass through the point x0. By deﬁnition, the equivalence classes [c] form the set
π1(X, x0). It is crucial that the product of loops is compatible with the equivalence
relation (4.28). Explicitly, if c ∼c+ mod x0 and d ∼d+ mod x0, then
c × c+ ∼d × d+
mod x0.
Therefore, the set π1(X, x0) of equivalence classes [c] forms a group with respect to
the following product:
[c][d] := [c × d].
The unit element of this group is given by the equivalence class [c] with c(ϕ) := x0
for all ϕ ∈[0, 2π].
The group π1(X). If the group π1(X, x0) does not depend on the choice of
the base point x0, up to group isomorphism, then we simply write π1(X) instead
of π1(X, x0). In particular, this is the case if the topological space X is arcwise
connected.
The arcwise connected topological space X is simply connected iﬀthe fun-
damental group π1(X) is trivial, that is, it consists of precisely one point.
In this case, we brieﬂy write π1(X) = 0. In order to rigorously compute funda-
mental groups and higher homotopy groups, one uses exact sequences. This will be
investigated in Vol. IV. Let us mention three examples.
(i) For the circle S1, we get π1(S1) = Z. Regarded as an additive group, we obtain
π1(S1) = Z.
(ii) The 2-dimensional sphere S2 is simply connected, and hence π1(S2) = 0.
(iii) The 2-dimensional torus T2 = S1 × S1: Regarded as an additive group, we get
π1(T2) = Z ⊕Z.
Let us heuristically discuss the situation (iii). We choose two circles on the torus,
namely, the equator e and a ﬁxed meridian m. In Fig. 4.8 on page 207, the equa-
tor (resp. meridian) corresponds to the curve ABA (resp. ACA). Intuitively, the
homotopy equivalence classes of loops on the torus have the form
[e]r[m]s,
r, s ∈Z
together with [e][m] = [m][e]. In terms of an additive group, the equivalence classes
have the form
r[e] + s[m],
r, s ∈Z.

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
225
This yields π1(T2) = Z ⊕Z.
The homotopy group π0(X). If the topological space X is arcwise connected,
then we deﬁne
π0(X) := {0}.
We brieﬂy write π0(X) = 0. If X has m + 1 path components, m = 0, 1, . . ., then
we deﬁne
π0(X) := Zm.
This is an additive group. Generally, the symbol π0(X) denotes the set of path
components of the topological space X.
4.4.6 Loop Spaces and Higher Homotopy Groups
The most intuitively evident topological invariant of a topological space
is the number of connected pieces into which it falls. Over the past one
hundred years or so we have come to realize that this primitive notion
admits in some sense two higher-dimensional analogues. These are the
homotopy and cohomology groups of the spaces in question25. . .
By some divine justice the homotopy groups of a ﬁnite polyhedron or a
manifold seem as diﬃcult to compute as they are easy to deﬁne . . . To this
day not all the homotopy groups of say the 2-sphere have been computed.26
Raoul Bott and Loring Tu, 1982
We will base our approach to higher homotopy groups on the study of loop spaces.
Intuitively, loops are closed continuous curves. In terms of physics, the transport
of physical information along loops is crucial, since it is possible that the initial
information diﬀers from the ﬁnal information after one surrounding.
This gain (or loss) of physical information is caused by interactions.
Loops play a fundamental role in gauge theory (e.g., Wilson loops) and in the
Ashtekar program for quantum gravitation (called loop gravity).27
Loop spaces. Consider the loop space Ωx0X introduced on page 223. The set
Ωx0X becomes a topological space equipped with the compact-open topology. In
order to introduce this topology, let C be a compact subset of S1, and let O be an
open subset of X. Let U(C, O) denote the set of all the maps of the form (4.27) on
page 223 with
c(C) ⊆O.
All the sets U(C, O) form a subbasis of the compact-open topology on the loop
space Ωx0X. The deﬁnition of a subbasis of a topology can be found on page 241.
In what follows, loop spaces are always equipped with the compact-open topology.
Now, in order to get higher homotopy groups, our idea is to use the loop space of
the loop space Ωx0X, and so on.
The homotopy groups πk(X, x0), k ≥2. We deﬁne the second homotopy
group of X by setting
π2(X, x0) := π1(Ωx0X, c0).
25 The basic relation between potentials in physics and cohomology are discussed
in Sect. 16.8 of Vol. I.

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
Here, the symbol c0 denotes the constant loop c0 : S1 →{x0}. In the general case,
we proceed by induction. For k = 1, 2, . . . , we use the inductive deﬁnition
πk(X, x0) := πk−1(Ωx0X, c0),
k = 2, 3, . . .
of the kth homotopy group of the topological space X.
The homotopy groups πk(X, x0) with k ≥2 are commutative.
The homotopy groups πk(X). If the groups πk(X, x0), k = 1, 2, . . . , do not
depend on the choice of the base point x0, up to group isomorphism, then we simply
write πk(X) instead of πk(X, x0). In particular, this is the case if the topological
space X is arcwise connected.
Mapping classes and homotopy groups. Let the topological space X be
arcwise connected. Then there exist the bijections
[Sk, X] ≃πk(X),
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Invariance of homotopy groups. The following result is crucial.
Theorem 4.16 Homotopically equivalent topological spaces (e.g., homeomorphic
spaces) have the same homotopy groups.
This has the following consequence: Two topological spaces X and Y are not
homotopically equivalent (and hence not homeomorphic) if there exists an index
k = 0, 1, 2, . . . with πk(X) ̸= πk(Y ).
Examples. The following homotopy groups are written as additive groups.
(i) Point: If the topological space X consists of precisely one point, then
πk(X) = 0,
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
A contractible space X has the same homotopy groups, since such a space is
homotopically equivalent to a point.
(ii) Unit circle: π1(S1) = Z, and πk(S1) = 0 if k = 0 or k ≥2. An annulus or the
surface of a cylinder have the same homotopy groups, since these topological
spaces are homotopically equivalent to the unit circle. It follows from π1(S1) ̸= 0
that the unit circle is not contractible.
(iii) 2-dimensional sphere: π0(S2) = π1(S2) = 0 and π1(S2) = π3(S2) = Z. Further-
more, πk(S2) = Z2 if k = 4, 5, 7, 8, 11, and
π6(S2) = Z12, π9(S2) = Z3, π10(S2) = Z15,
π22(S2) = Z132 ⊕Z2.
(iv) n-dimensional sphere: For n = 1, 2, . . . , we have
πn(Sn) = Z,
πk(Sn) = 0,
k = 0, . . . , n −1.
The product theorem. For the Cartesian product X × Y of two topological
spaces X and Y , we get
πk(X × Y, (x0, y0)) = πk(X, x0) × πk(Y, y0),
k = 1, 2, . . . ,
in the sense of a direct group product.
Serre’s ﬁniteness theorem. In his 1951 thesis, Serre proved the following
fundamental result: Let m = 0, 1, . . . and n = 1, 2, . . .
With the only exceptions πn(Sn) = Z and π4n−1(S2n), all the homotopy
groups πm(Sn) of spheres are ﬁnite.

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
227
The exceptional homotopy group π4n−1(S2n) is the direct sum of Z with a ﬁnite
group.28 A list of known homotopy groups of spheres can be found in the Appendix
to:
C. Dodson and P. Parker, A Users’ Guide to Algebraic Topology, Kluwer,
Dordrecht, 1997.
Historical remark. The fundamental group dates back to Poincar´e (1854–
1912). The higher homotopy groups were introduced by Hurewicz (1904–1956) in
the 1930s.
4.4.7 Homology, Cohomology, and Electrodynamics
The notions of homology and cohomology are deeply rooted in electrodynamics.
This will be thoroughly studied in Vol. IV. In particular, we will show that the
most simple approach to homology and cohomology groups is related to electrical
circuits. This generalizes then to the Maxwell equations in electrodynamics by using
diﬀerential forms and the de Rham cohomology.
4.4.8 Bott’s Periodicity Theorem
I was very fortunate to be the ﬁrst to notice that the loop space of a Lie
group is very easily attacked with Morse-theoretic methods.29 It turns out
if you look at the loop space rather than at the group, then the so-called
diagram of the group on the universal covering of its maximal torus plays
an essential role. So you can read oﬀtopological properties of the loop
space much more easily from the diagram of the group than you can read
oﬀthings about the group itself. . .
During the period 1955–57 there was a controversy in homotopy theory.
The question concerned the homotopy group of the unitary group in di-
mension 10. The homotopy theorists said it was the cyclic group Z3. The
results of Borel and Hirzebruch predicted it to be 0. This contradiction in-
trigued me, and I thought I should be able to say something about it using
Morse-theoretic techniques that Samelson and I had discovered. Finally I
hit upon a very complicated method involving the exceptional Lie group
G2 to check the conundrum independently. My good friend Arnold Shapiro
and I spent all weekend computing. At the end we came out of the side of
Borel and Hirzebruch, so I was convinced that they were right. And if they
were right the table of homotopy groups started to look periodic for a long
stretch. In the odd dimensions they were Z up to nine dimensions, and in
the even dimensions they were 0. So I thought, “Maybe they are periodic
all the way.” And fairly soon after I saw my old ideas would actually do
the job. In this way the unitary group was then settled.
Then I started to think about the orthogonal group, and that was much
harder. But I do remember precisely when I suddenly saw how to deal

the Abel prize in 2003.

with it. That occurred after we had left the Institute in Princeton and
were moving house. In a ﬂash I saw how it all ﬁtted together.30
Raoul Bott, 2001
Let U(n) be the group of complex unitary (n × n)-matrices. It is crucial that the
homotopy groups
πk(U(n)),
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
are independent of n if the natural number n is suﬃciently large. Explicitly, we need
0 ≤k < 2n. In this case, we brieﬂy write πk(U). These stable homotopy groups are
completely known. In fact, the fundamental Bott periodicity theorem says that
π0(U) = 0, π1(U) = Z,
πk+2(U) = πk(U),
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
This corresponds to the period 2.
Let O(n) be the group of real orthogonal (n × n)-matrices. If n is suﬃciently
large, that is, 0 ≤k < n −1, then the homotopy groups
πk(O(n))
are independent of n. We brieﬂy write πk(O). These stable homotopy groups are
also completely known. In this case, the Bott periodicity theorem says that
πk+8(O) = πk(O),
k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
together with π0(O) = π1(O) = Z2, and
πj(O) = 0, j = 2, 4, 5, 6,
πm(O) = Z, m = 3, 7.
This corresponds to the period 8.
4.4.9 K-Theory
K-theory was introduced by Grothendieck in his formulation of the Rie-
mann–Roch–Hirzebruch theorem in 1958.31 For each projective algebraic
variety, Grothendieck constructed a group from the category of coherent
algebraic sheaves, and showed that it had many nice properties. About
1960, Atiyah and Hirzebruch constructed a topological analog deﬁned for
any compact space X, a group K(X) constructed from the category of
vector bundles on X. . . Topological K-theory has become an important
tool in topology. Using K-theory, Adams and Atiyah were able to give a
simple proof that the only spheres which can be provided with H-space
structures are the spheres of dimension 1, 3, and 7. Moreover, Adams was
able to derive a substantial part of stable homotopy theory from K-theory.
Further applications to analysis are found in the work of Atiyah–Singer
on the index theorem, Quillen, Bass, and others. A key factor in these
applications is the Bott periodicity for Lie groups.32

Semi-rings. Consider the set N of natural numbers 0, 1, 2, . . . Set S := N. Then,
for all m, n, s ∈S, the following hold.
(S0) Consistency: m + n, mn ∈S.
(S1) Associativity: (m + n) + s = m + (n + s) and (mn)s = m(ns).
(S2) Zero element: There exists a uniquely determined element 0 in S with the
property m + 0 = m for all m ∈S.
(S3) Commutativity: m + n = n + m and mn = nm.
(S4) Regularity: It follows from m, n ∈S and m + s = n + s for all s ∈S that
m = n.
In general, a set S is called a semi-ring iﬀan addition m+n and a multiplication mn
exist for certain elements of S such that for all m, n, s ∈S the conditions (S0)–(S2)
are satisﬁed. The semi-ring is called commutative (resp. regular) iﬀ, in addition,
condition (S3) (resp. (S4)) is satisﬁed.
The map χ : S →S′ from the semi-ring S into the semi-ring S′ is called a
semi-ring morphism iﬀit respects sums and products, that is,
χ(m + n) = χ(m) + χ(n),
χ(mn) = χ(m)χ(n)
for all
m, n ∈S.
Bijective semi-ring morphisms are called semi-ring isomorphisms.
The universal ring extension K(S) of a regular semi-ring S. The com-
mutative semi-ring N of natural numbers 0, 1, 2, . . . can be extended to the com-
mutative ring Z of integers 0, ±1, ±2, . . . We want to generalize this. In terms of
integers, the idea of the following general construction is to identify, say, the integer
−2 with the following family of pairs:
(0, 2), (2, 4), (4, 6), . . .
Note that −2 = 0 −2 = 2 −4 = . . . Our approach will be based on the following

universal way. This means that all the ring morphisms ϱ : K(S) →R generate all
possible semi-ring morphisms σ : S →R from the semi-ring S into the ring R.
Theorem 4.17 Let S be a regular commutative semi-ring. Then:
(i) There exist a commutative ring K(S) and an injective semi-ring morphism
i : S →K(S).
(ii) Each extension of the semi-ring S to a commutative ring R contains a
subring which is isomorphic to K(S).
(iii) Each ring morphism ϱ : K(S) →R from the ring K(S) into the arbitrary
ring R generates the semi-ring morphism ϱ ◦i : S →R (i.e., the diagram (4.29) is
commutative).
(iv) Conversely, each semi-ring morphism σ : S →R from the semi-ring S into
the ring R can be obtained by (iii).
Proof. We sketch the proof, and we recommend the reader to complete the proof
by himself/herself.

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
Ad (i). (I) Equivalence classes. For m, n, r, s ∈S, we consider the symbols (m, n)
and (r, s).33 We write (m, n) ∼(r, s) iﬀ
m + s = r + n.
This is an equivalence relation. Let us prove the transitivity. Here, we will need the
regularity of S. Suppose that
[m, n] ∼[r, s]
and
[r, s] ∼[u, v].
Then m + s = r + n and r + v = u + s. Adding this, we get
(m + v) + (s + r) = (u + n) + (s + r).
Since the semi-ring S is assumed to be regular, we obtain m + v = u + n. Hence
[m, n] ∼[u, v].
The corresponding equivalence classes [(m, n)] form the space K(S).
(II) Addition and multiplication of equivalence classes: We deﬁne
[(m, n)] + [(r, s)] := [(m + r, n + s)],
[(m, n)][(r, s)] := [(mr + ns, ms + nr)].
These operations do not depend on the choice of the representatives. With respect
to these operations, K(S) becomes a commutative ring. For each m, deﬁne
i(m) := [(m, 0)].
The map i : S →K(S) is injective. In fact, if i(m) = 0, then [(m, 0)] = [(0, 0].
Hence m + 0 = 0 + 0. This implies m = 0.
Ad (ii). If the ring R is an extension of the semi-ring S, then we deﬁne the map
ϱ : K(S) →R given by
ϱ([(m, n)]) := m −n.
This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the representatives (m, n). The
map ϱ is injective. Therefore, we can identify the image ϱ(S) with S.
Ad (iii). This is obvious.
Ad (iv). Deﬁne ϱ([(m, 0)]) := σ(m).

Example. Let S be the set of the linear spaces R0, R1, R2, . . . Naturally enough,
R0 := {0}. For all m, n ∈N, we deﬁne the direct sum ⊕and the tensor product ⊗
by setting
Rm ⊕Rn := Rm+n,
Rn ⊗Rn := Rmn.
The set S is a semi-ring which is isomorphic to the semi-ring N, and the ring K(S) is
isomorphic to the ring Z of integers. Deﬁne the ﬁber dimension map j : K(S) →Z
by setting
j : ([Rm, Rn)]) := m −n.
(4.30)
This map does not depend on the choice of the representatives. In fact, if
[(Rm, Rn)] = [(Rr, Rs)],
then Rm ⊕Rs = Rr ⊕Rs. Hence m + s = r + n. This implies m −n = r −s.
33 Intuitively, if m and n are natural numbers, then (m, n) corresponds to the
integer m −n. We use equivalence classes, since diﬀerent symbols (m, n) and
(r, s) may yield the same integer. Note that m −n = r −s iﬀm + s = r + n.

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
231
Topological K-theory represents a highly non-trivial generalization of this
simple example.
Let us discuss this.
The universal Grothendieck ring K(S) for general commutative semi-
rings. Each ring is regular. Therefore, if a ring R contains a subset S which is a
semi-ring, then S is regular. Consequently, if the given semi-ring S is not regular,
then it cannot be extended to a ring. The following theorem yields the optimal
generalization of Theorem 4.17.
Theorem 4.18 For each commutative semi-ring S, the following universal state-
ments hold:
(i) There exist a ring K(S) and a semi-ring morphism i : S →K(S).
(ii) Each ring morphism ϱ : K(S) →R from the ring K(S) into the arbitrary
ring R generates the semi-ring morphism ϱ ◦i : S →R (i.e., the diagram (4.29)
above is commutative).
(iii) Conversely, each semi-ring morphism σ : S →R from the semi-ring S into
the ring R can be obtained by (ii).
(iv) If the semi-ring S is regular, then the map i : S →K(S) is injective.
Proof. We have to modify the proof of Theorem 4.17 in the following way. For
m, n, r, s ∈S, we write (m, n) ∼(r, s) iﬀthere exists an element p of S such that
m + n + p = r + s + p.
This modiﬁcation is needed in order to guarantee the transitivity of the equivalence
relation in the case where the semi-ring S is not regular.
2
Prototype. Choose K = R or K = C. Let VectK denote the semi-ring of all
ﬁnite-dimensional linear spaces X over K with respect to the direct sum ⊕and
the tensor product ⊗. Here, isomorphic linear spaces are identiﬁed with each other.
One shows as above that the corresponding K-ring K(VectK) is isomorphic to the
ring Z.
Application to vector bundles on a compact manifold. Let M be a ﬁnite-
dimensional compact manifold (e.g., a sphere). Choose Kn with n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .
Here, K = R (real case) or (K = C) (complex case). Let VectK(M) be the space of
vector bundles over M with typical ﬁber Kn, where n = 0, 1, 2, . . . More precisely,
two isomorphic vector bundles are identiﬁed with each other. If V, W ∈VectK(M),
then the direct sum and the tensor product
V ⊕W,
V ⊗W
are well-deﬁned by Sect. 4.4.2. This way, the space VectK(M) becomes a semi-ring.
The Grothendieck ring K(VectK(M)) is called the K-ring of the manifold M. To
simplify notation, we write KK(M)) instead of K(VectK(M)).
This way, we assign to each compact manifold M the ring KK(M).
It turns out that this is a sophisticated tool in modern topology. Each element of
KK(M) is an equivalence class [(V, W)] where V and W are vector bundles (up to
bundle isomorphisms) with typical ﬁbers Km and Kn, respectively. We deﬁne the
map j : KK(M) →Z by setting
j([V, W]) := m −n.
Similarly as in (4.30), this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the repre-
sentatives. For an arcwise connected manifold M, we deﬁne the reduced K-ring

232
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
K(M) := j−1(0).
It turns out that the map j : KR(M) →Z is a ring epimorphism. If we introduce
the equivalence relation A ∼B iﬀA −B ∈K(M), then the K-ring KR(M) is
decomposed in the equivalence classes [A]. Each of these classes is bijective to the
reduced K-ring K(X). Furthermore,
KR(M)/K(M) ≃Z.
That is, the quotient ring of the ring KR(M) modulo the reduced ring K(M) is
isomorphic to the ring of integers. The following deep theorem tells us that the
additive group of the ring K(Sn) is known for all spheres Sn, n = 1, 2, . . .
Theorem 4.19 The additive groups K(Sn) are given by
K(S1) = K(S2) = Z/mod 2,
K(S4) = K(S8) = Z,
and K(Sn) = 0 if n = 3, 5, 6, 7.
Moreover, we have the periodicity property K(Sn) = K(Sn+8) for all dimensions
n = 1, 2, . . .
The following result is a special case of the Atiyah–J¨anich theorem which will
be considered on page 235. Let F(H) denote the space of all linear continuous
Fredholm operators A : H →H on the complex inﬁnite-dimensional separable
Hilbert space H.
Theorem 4.20 For n = 1, 2, . . . , we have
KC(Sn) ≃πn(F(H)),
n = 1, 2, . . . ,
in the sense of a bijection.
In particular, the K-ring KC(S1) of the unit circle S1 is bijective to the fun-
damental group π1(F(H)) of the space of linear continuous Fredholm operators on
the complex inﬁnite-dimensional separable Hilbert space H.
This shows that the sophisticated K-ring KC(S1) of the unit circle sees the
topological structure of the space F(H) of linear continuous Fredholm operators
on the Hilbert space H. The index of linear continuous Fredholm operators is the
crucial quantity in the formulation of the Atiyah–Singer index theorem. In fact, it
turns out that K-theory can be used in order to prove the Atiyah–Singer theorem
about the index of elliptic partial diﬀerential equations (or more general pseudo-
diﬀerential equations) on compact Riemannian manifolds. The prototype of this
result can be found in Sect. 5.6.9 of Vol. I (see the hints for further reading on page
235).
The theorem of Adams about vector ﬁelds on spheres. Choose the
number n = 1, 2, 3, . . . By deﬁnition, the number Span(Sn) is equal to the maximal
number of continuous tangent vector ﬁelds on the n-dimensional sphere Sn which
are linearly independent at every point of the sphere. Let k(n) be the number of
factors 2 in the prime number decomposition of the even natural number n + 1
(e.g., 48 = 23 · 32 implies k(48) = 3). Dividing k(n) by 4, we get
k(n) = 4m(n) + r(n)
where r(n) = 0, 1, 2, 3 and k(n) = 0, 1, 2, . . . (e.g., m(48) = 0 and r(48) = 3).

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
233
Theorem 4.21 If n is even, then Span (Sn) = 0. If n is odd, then
Span(Sn) = 8m(n) + 2r(n) −1.
Using K-theory, this famous theorem was proven by J. Adams, Vector ﬁelds on
spheres, Ann. of Math. 75 (1962), 603–632. For example,
Span(S1) = 1, Span(S3) = 3, Span(S5) = 1, Span(S7) = 7.
Furthermore, Span(S4k+1) = 1 and (S8k+3) = 3 if k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Finally,
Span(Sn) = n iﬀn = 1, 3, 7. In terms of physics, the theorem of Adams tells
us an important information about the velocity ﬁelds on n-dimensional spheres.
The theorem of Kervaire and Milnor on division algebras. A real ﬁnite-
dimensional nonzero algebra A is called a division algebra iﬀfor given elements a, b
of A with a ̸= 0, the two equations
ax = b,
ay = b
have unique solutions x and y in A. Examples for division algebras are R (the ﬁeld
of real numbers), C (the ﬁeld of complex numbers), H (the skew-ﬁeld of quaternions,
O) (the non-associative algebra of octonions).34 The dimensions of these division
algebras are 1, 2, 4, 8, respectively.
Theorem 4.22 The dimension of an arbitrary division algebra is 1, 2, 4, 8.
This theorem was independently proven by Kervaire and Milnor in 1958 by
using Bott’s periodicity theorem from 1958.35 A proof based on K-theory can be
found in F. Hirzebruch (1995) quoted on page 235. Interestingly enough, so far only
topological proofs are known for this purely algebraic theorem.
4.4.10 Application to Fredholm Operators
In the winter semester 1900/01 Holmgren, who had come from Uppsala
(Sweden) to study under Hilbert in G¨ottingen (Germany), held a lecture
in Hilbert’s seminar on Fredholm’s work on linear integral equations which
had been published the previous year. This was a decisive day in Hilbert’s
life. He took up Fredholm’s discovery with great zeal, and combined it
with his variational method.
Otto Blumenthal, 193236
To explain the basic idea of Fredholm operators, consider the linear system
a11x1 + a12x2 = b1,
a21x1 + a22x2 = b2.
(4.31)
We are given the complex numbers aij, bi with i, j = 1, 2. We are looking for the
complex numbers x1, x2. The homogeneous dual problem is given by

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
a11y1 + a21y2 = 0,
a12y1 + a22y2 = 0.
(4.32)
The classical Fredholm alternative reads as follows:
Equation (4.31) has a solution iﬀb1y1 + b2y2 = 0 for all solutions y1, y2
of the dual equation (4.32).
Uniqueness implies existence (i.e., if we know that equation (4.31) has at
most one solution, then there exists a unique solution).
The theory of linear Fredholm operators generalizes the Fredholm alternative to
inﬁnite dimensions.
Linear Fredholm Operators. Let H be a complex separable Hilbert space,
and let L(H, H) be the space of all linear and continuous operators A : H →H.
Here, L(H, H) is a complex Banach space equipped with the operator norm
||A|| := sup
||x||≤1
||Ax||.
The operator A ∈L(H, H) is called a Fredholm operator iﬀthe two conditions
dim ker(A) < ∞and codim im(A) < ∞are fulﬁlled. Fredholm operators are dis-
tinguished by the fact that the solution set of the equation (4.34) below has ﬁnite
dimension, and we have only a ﬁnite number of linearly independent solvability
conditions. The ﬁnite number
ind(A) := dim ker(A) −codim im(A)
(4.33)
is called the index of the operator A. If dim H < ∞, then ind(A) = 0. For example,
set H := C2. Then the operator A : H →H given by the equation (4.31) has
the index zero. The set of all Fredholm operators in L(H, H) is denoted by F(H).
Consider the equation
Ax = b,
x ∈H.
(4.34)
We assume that A ∈F(H). Let b ∈H be given. Suppose that x is a solution of
(4.34). Then
(Adf)(x) = f(Ax) = f(b).
This implies that f(b) = 0 for all f ∈Hd with Adf = 0. A linear Fredholm operator
A has the important property that this simple necessary solvability condition for
equation (4.34) is also suﬃcient for the existence of a solution. The following hold:
The equation (4.34) has a solution iﬀf(b) = 0 for all linear continuous
functionals f ∈Hd with Adf = 0. The solution set of (4.34) is a linear
manifold of dimension dim ker(A). The number
dim(Ad) = dim ker(A) −ind(A)
is equal to the number of linearly independent solvability conditions for
(4.34). In particular, if ind(A) = 0, then equation (4.34) has the crucial
property that uniqueness implies existence.
Stability of the index of a Fredholm operator. The importance of the
index of a Fredholm operator relies on the fact that it is invariant under suﬃciently
small perturbations with respect to the operator norm.

4.4 Equivalence Classes in Topology
235
The set F(H) of Fredholm operators is open in L(H, H), and the index
is locally constant. Hence the index is constant on each component (i.e.,
maximal connected subset) of F(H).
The Atiyah–J¨anich theorem about the homotopic classiﬁcation of
families of linear Fredholm operators. Let M be a compact connected sepa-
rated topological space (e.g., a sphere). We consider continuous maps of the form
μ : M →F(H).
More precisely, let us consider the space [M, F(H)] of mapping classes (with respect
to homotopies) introduced on page 219.
Theorem 4.23 If dim H = ∞, then we have [M, F(H)] ≃KC(M), in the sense of
a bijection.
This important theorem due to Atiyah and J¨anich relates the K-ring KC(M)
of a compact connected separated topological space M to the homotopic structure
of families of linear Fredholm operators parameterized by M. If we replace the set
of Fredholm operators F(H) by the set GL(H) of invertible linear operators on
L(H, H), then the following theorem due to Kuipers shows that the situation is
much simpler.
If dim H = ∞, then the space [M, GL(H)] consists precisely of one point.

Perspectives
In the following volumes of this monograph, we will study important applications
of topology to physics.
In quantum physics, one encounters quantum numbers.

4.5 The Strategy of Partial Ordering
237
This means that crucial quantum phenomena are described by discrete numbers. In
mathematics, one knows two important methods in order to classify mathematical
structures by discrete numbers. This concerns
• symmetry (e.g., the representation theory of groups and algebras), and
• qualitative behavior (topological invariants).
In Vol. IV on quantum mathematics, we will show that these two approaches are
crucial for quantum physics.
4.5 The Strategy of Partial Ordering
Partially ordered sets occur quite often in mathematics.
Folklore
For natural numbers a, b, c, we have the following ordering relations:
(P1) Reﬂexivity: a ≤a;
(P2) Symmetry: If a ≤b and b ≤a, then a = b.
(P3) Transitivity: a ≤b and b ≤c imply a ≤c.
In general, a set N is called partially ordered iﬀthere is a ≤-relation deﬁned on
certain elements a, b of N such that (P1)–(P3) hold for all a, b, c ∈N. We write
a < c iﬀa ≤b and a ̸= b. Partially ordered sets are also called posets. In addition,
a set N is called totally ordered iﬀthe following hold:
(O1) N is partially ordered;
(O2) we have a ≤b or b ≤a for all a, b ∈N.
For example, both the set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers are totally
ordered. For all (a, b), (c, d) ∈R2, we deﬁne
(a, b) ≤(c, d)
iﬀ
a ≤b and c ≤d.
This way, R2 becomes a partially ordered set, which is not totally ordered. In fact,
we have neither (1, 2) ≤(2, 1) nor (2, 1) ≤(1, 2). Furthermore, for a poset N and
its subsets S, we introduce the following terminology:
• Maximal element of N: An element m of N is called maximal iﬀthere is no
element a in N with m < a. Similarly, an element m of N is called minimal iﬀ
there is no element a in N with a < m.
• Greatest element of N: An element g of N is called greatest iﬀa ≤g for all
a ∈N.37 Similarly, an element s of N is called smallest iﬀs ≤a for all a ∈N.
• Upper bound of the subset S: The element b ∈N is called an upper (resp. lower)
bound of the subset S of N iﬀa ≤b (resp. b ≤a) for all a ∈S.
• Supremum sup(S) of the subset S: The supremum of S is the smallest upper
bound of S. We denote this by sup(S).
• Inﬁmum inf(S) of the subset S: The inﬁmum of S is the greatest lower bound of
S. We denote this by inf(S). If sup(S) (resp. inf(S)) exists, then it is unique.
• Well-ordering: The set N is well-ordered iﬀit is totally ordered and each
nonempty subset of N has a smallest element.
• Lattice: The set N is called a lattice iﬀit is partially ordered and the supremum
sup({a, b}) and the inﬁmum inf({a, b}) exist for each two-point subset {a, b} of
the set N.
37 By symmetry, the greatest element is uniquely determined. In contrast to this,
maximal elements are not always unique.

Fig. 4.13. Feynman diagram as a partially ordered set
• Complete lattice: The set N is called a complete lattice iﬀthe supremum sup(S)
and the inﬁmum inf(S) exist for each nonempty subset S of N.
For the theory of lattices, we refer to:
G. Birkhoﬀ, Lattice Theory, Amer. Math. Soc., New York, 1968.
Examples. Each interval of the real line is an ordered set. The interval ]0, 1] has
the point x = 1 as greatest element, but this interval has no smallest element. As a
subset of the real line, the interval ]0, 1] has the point x = 1 as supremum and the
point x = 0 as inﬁmum. The real line is a lattice, but not a complete lattice, since
the set R has neither a supremum nor an inﬁmum.
4.5.1 Feynman Diagrams
Scattering processes between elementary particles can be represented by special
graphs called Feynman diagrams. This is a basic tool in elementary particle physics
and quantum ﬁeld theory.38 Fig. 4.13 shows the prototype of a Feynman diagram.
We have vertices and oriented connecting lines. The basic idea is to write
a < c
if an arrow points from the vertex a to the vertex c (which is diﬀerent from the
vertex a). In addition, we assume that this can be extended to a partially ordered
set by adding the reﬂexivity property (P1) above and by demanding the validity
of the transitivity property (P3) above. For example, Fig. 4.13 describes a set of
vertices a, b, c, d, m, n with the basic relations
a < c, b < c, c < d, d < m, d < n.
The other ≤-relations are obtained from this by using (P1) and (P3). For example,
we write a ≤a, and
a < d,
a < m,
a < n.
Summarizing, all of the ≤-relations of the set N = {a, b, c, d, m, n} corresponding
to Fig. 4.13 are given by the following list:
• a ≤a, a ≤c, a ≤d, a ≤m, a ≤n;
• b ≤b, b ≤c, b ≤d, b ≤m, b ≤n;
• c ≤c, c ≤d, c ≤m, c ≤n;
• d ≤d, d ≤m, d ≤n;
• m ≤m, n ≤n.

Apart: The Dispersion of Feynman Diagrams in Postwar Physics, University of
Chicago Press, 2005.

4.5 The Strategy of Partial Ordering
239
One checks easily that N is indeed a partially ordered set. Intuitively, for two
vertices s and r the relation s ≤r means that either s = r or there exists a chain
of oriented arrows which points from the vertex s to the vertex r. In Fig. 4.13, the
six vertices a, b, c, d, m, n do not correspond to a totally ordered set, since we have
neither a ≤b nor b ≤a. But the three vertices a, c, d correspond to a totally ordered
set.
The Feynman diagrams used in quantum electrodynamics will be discussed in
Chap. 14. In contrast to the prototype depicted in Fig. 4.13, we will have diﬀerent
types of connecting lines corresponding to electrons, positrons, and photons in
quantum electrodynamics. Moreover, we have to distinguish between internal lines
and external lines. To explain this, let us distinguish between the internal vertices
c, d and the external vertices a, b, m, n. Then the line cd is called an internal line and
ac, bc, dm, dn are called external lines. Now Fig. 4.13 describes the scattering of the
two incoming particles ac and bc resulting in the two outgoing particles dm and dn.
The external lines describe particles observed in scattering processes, whereas the
internal lines describe quantum ﬂuctuations of the vacuum (ground state) which
strongly inﬂuence the scattering process.
Traditionally, for the sake of simplicity, physicists do not draw the external
vertices. We will do the same. Thus, using the convention of physicists, the dia-
gram depicted in Fig. 4.13 describes the ﬁve internal lines ac, bc, cd, dm, dn which
correspond to ﬁve virtual particles living in the vacuum. Much material about math-
ematical graph theory can be found in J. Gross and J. Yellen (Eds.), Handbook of
Graph Theory, CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, 2004.
4.5.2 The Abstract Entropy Principle in Thermodynamics
Our goal is an assertion of the form
s ≤a
implies
S(s) = S(a).
(4.35)
Theorem 4.24 Let S : X →[−∞, ∞[ be a monotone increasing function on the
nonempty partially ordered set X, that is, a ≤b implies S(a) ≤S(b). In addition,
suppose that each monotone increasing sequence in X has an upper bound. Then
there exists an element s of X with the stability property (4.35) for all a ∈X.
This theorem due to Br´ezis and Browder allows the following physical inter-
pretation:39 We regard the elements a of X as states of a many-particle system
in physics. The function S assigns to the state a the entropy S(a). The ordering
relation a ≤b means that the state a may pass to the state b at later time. Thus,
a monotone increasing sequence a1 ≤a2 ≤. . . corresponds to a possible time de-
velopment of the physical system with the corresponding increasing entropy values
S(a1) ≤S(a2) ≤. . . ,
by the second law of thermodynamics. Theorem 4.24 tells us the existence of a
stable equilibrium state s in the following sense: If the system is in the state s, then
the entropy can no longer increase.
The proof of Theorem 4.24 can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. III, p. 163 (see
the references on page 1049).

4.5.3 Convergence of Generalized Sequences
In general topological spaces, classical sequences are not enough for the
characterization of closed sets by convergence.
Folklore
Directed index set. In classical analysis, a sequence (xn) is equipped with an
index n = 0, 1, 2, . . . which lies in the set N = {0, 1, 2, . . .} of natural numbers. In
modern analysis (e.g., the theory of von Neumann algebras), one needs sequences
(xν) where the index ν lies in a more general directed set N. By deﬁnition, a set
N is called directed (or a generalized index set) iﬀthe following hold:
(D1) N is partially ordered.
(D2) If a, b ∈N, then there exists an element d in N such that a ≤d and b ≤d.
For example, both the set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers are
directed. Moreover, let X be an arbitrary set. Then the family {U(x)} of all the
subsets U(x) of X which contain the given point x forms a directed set by the
convention
U(x) ≤V (x)
iﬀ
V (x) ⊆U(x).
Note that U(x), V (x) ≤U(x) ∩V (x). We say that the family {U(x)} is directed by
inverse inclusion.
Generalized sequence. Let X be a separated topological space, and let N be
a directed set.40 By deﬁnition, a generalized sequence (xν) in the topological space
X is a map which assigns to each index ν in N an element xν in X. Obviously,
every classical sequence (xn) with natural numbers n as indices is a generalized
sequence. For a generalized sequence (xν), we write
lim
ν→∞xν = x
(4.36)
iﬀfor each open neighborhood U(x) of the point x, there exists an index ν0 such
that xν ∈U(x) for all indices ν with ν0 ≤ν. The following statements hold:
(a) Fix the point x in X. Consider the sequence (xU(x)), where the index U(x) is
an arbitrary open neighborhood of the point x, and xU(x) is some point of the
set U(x). Then the point x is the limit of the sequence (xU(x)).
(b) A subset C of the topological space X is closed iﬀfor each generalized sequence
(xν) in C it follows from (4.36) that x ∈C.
(c) In particular, if X is a metric space (e.g., a subset of Rm or of a Hilbert space),
then statement (b) remains valid if we only use classical sequences.
(d) The generalized limit is unique (in a separated space).
For the proofs, see
J. Kelley, General Topology, van Nostrand, New York, 1955.
This monograph contains a systematic theory of generalized sequences. A sum-
mary (including the theory of metric and topological spaces, Hilbert spaces, Banach
spaces, and locally convex spaces) can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. I, Appendix
(see the references on page 1049). Generalized sequences are important for charac-
terizing von Neumann algebras in quantum mechanics (see Sect. 7.18 on page 654).
Generalized sequences are also called Moore–Smith sequences or nets.
40 The topological space X is called separated (or a Hausdorﬀspace) iﬀfor any two
diﬀerent points x and y in X, there exist disjoint open neighborhoods U(x) and
V (y). Most topological spaces have this property. Hausdorﬀ(1868–1942) wrote
the ﬁrst textbook on set theory, and the theory of topological and metric spaces
in 1914: F. Hausdorﬀ, Foundation of Set Theory, Teubner, Leipzig (in German).
In 1942 Hausdorﬀand his family committed suicide in order to escape the de-
portation into a German concentration camp.

4.5.4 Inductive and Projective Topologies
The reader who is not familiar with the concept of topological space should look
at Sect. 5.5 of Vol. I. The prototype of a topological space is the real line R. The
terminology of set theory (e.g., images and pre-images of maps) is explained in the
Appendix to Vol. I.
Images and pre-images. Let f : X →Y be a map. Then, for all subsets A
and B of X and all subsets U and V of Y, the following hold:
• f(A ∪B) = f(A) ∪f(B);
• f(A ∩B) ⊆f(A) ∩f(B);
• f −1(U ∪V ) = f −1(U) ∪f −1(V );
• f −1(U ∩V ) = f −1(U) ∩f −1(V ).
We will use this in order to construct topologies which change arbitrary maps into
continuous ones.
Topological spaces and continuous maps. Let X be a set. A family T of
subsets of X is called a topology on X iﬀthe following hold:
(T1) X ∈T and ∅∈T ;
(T2) T is invariant under forming ﬁnite intersections (i.e., if X1, . . . , Xn ∈T , then
∩n
k=1Xk ∈T ); and
(T3) T is invariant under forming arbitrary unions (i.e., if Xα ∈T for all α ∈A,
then ∪α∈AXα ∈T ).
The set X equipped with a ﬁxed topology T is called a topological space. The
subsets of X belonging to T are called T -open (or brieﬂy open).
A map f : X →Y between two topological spaces X and Y is continuous
iﬀthe pre-images of open sets are open.
Basis of a topology. Let X be a topological space with the topology T . A
family B of open subsets of X is called a basis of the topology T iﬀany open subset
of X is the union of sets from B.
Subbasis of a topology. Again let X be a topological space with the topology
T . A family S of open subsets of the topological space X is called a subbasis of
the topology T iﬀall the ﬁnite intersections of the sets from S form a basis of the
topology T . We also say that the family S generates the topology T iﬀit forms a
subbasis of T .
As an example, consider the real line R equipped with the usual topology. Then
the family of all open intervals together with the empty set form a basis of the
topology on R. Moreover, the family of all open intervals of inﬁnite length forms
a subbasis of the topology on R. This follows from the fact that each ﬁnite open
interval can be represented as the intersection of two open intervals of inﬁnite
length.
Comparison of topologies. Let T and S be two topologies on the set X.
Suppose that
T ⊆S.
Then the topology T is called weaker than the topology S, and S is called stronger
than T . Let F be a family of subsets of X with X ∈F and ∅∈F.
There exists a uniquely determined weakest topology T on X with the prop-
erty F ⊆T .
Explicitly, a subset Y of X is contained in T iﬀit is the union of ﬁnite intersections
of sets from F. In other words, the family F is a subbasis of the topology T (i.e.,
the family F generates the topology T ).

242
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
In addition, the family F is a basis of the topology T iﬀit is invariant under
ﬁnite intersections.
Inductive topology. We are given the family of maps
iα : Xα →Y,
α ∈A
(4.37)
on the topological spaces Xα. We want to introduce a nontrivial topology on the
target space Y such that all the maps iα are continuous.41
There exists a uniquely determined strongest topology on the target space
Y such that all the maps (4.37) are continuous.
This topology is called the inductive topology on the target space Y with respect
to the family {iα}α∈A of maps. Explicitly, a subbasis S of the inductive topology is
given in the following way. By deﬁnition, the subset O of the target space Y belongs
to S iﬀthe pre-image i−1
α (O) is open in Xα for all indices α. Let us consider two
typical examples.
(i) The coproduct topology: By deﬁnition, the coproduct ‘
α∈A Xα of the family
{Xα}α∈A of topological spaces Xα consists of all the pairs (α, x), where α ∈A
and x ∈Xα. The canonical maps
iα : Xα →
a
β∈A
Xβ,
α ∈A
are given by iα(x) := (α, x). The inductive topology with respect to {iα} is
called the coproduct topology on ‘
α∈A Xα. Naturally enough, the map
f :
a
α∈A
Xα →Z
is continuous iﬀall the composite maps f ◦iα : Xα →Z, α ∈A, are continuous.
(ii) Quotient topology: Let ∼be an equivalence relation on the topological space
X. Consider the canonical map
π : X →X/ ∼
given by π(x) := [x]. The quotient topology on X/ ∼is the inductive topology
with respect to the map π. This is the strongest topology on X/ ∼such that
the canonical map π is continuous. Explicitly, a subset S of X/ ∼is open iﬀ
the pre-image π−1(S) is open in the initial space X. Let Z be a topological
space. The map
f : X/ ∼→
Z
is continuous iﬀthe composite map f ◦π : X →Z is continuous.
Now we want to study the dual situation.
Projective topology. We are given the family of maps
πα : Y →Xα,
α ∈A,
(4.38)
where Xα is a topological space for each index α. We want to introduce a nontrivial
topology on the initial space Y such that all the maps πα are continuous.42
41 If only the set Y and the empty set are open on Y , then we obtain the weakest
topology on the target space Y such that all the maps iα are continuous. We are
not interested in this trivial case.
42 If all the subsets of Y are open, then we obtain the strongest topology on the
initial space Y such that all the maps πα are continuous. We are not interested
in this trivial case.

4.5 The Strategy of Partial Ordering
243
There exists a uniquely determined weakest topology on the initial space Y
such that all the maps (4.38) are continuous.
This topology is called the projective topology on the initial space Y with respect
to the family {πα}α∈A of maps. Explicitly, the projective topology is generated by
all the sets π−1
α (O) where O is an open set in Xα, and α is an arbitrary index. Let
us consider two typical examples.
(i) The product topology: By deﬁnition, the Cartesian product Q
α∈A Xα consists
of all the tuples (xα)α∈A. The canonical map
πα :
Y
β∈A
Xβ →Xα,
α ∈A
is given by πα((xβ)) = xα. The projective topology with respect to {πα}α∈A
is called the product topology on Q
α∈A Xα. Let Z be a topological space.
Naturally enough, the map
f : Z →
Y
β∈A
Xβ
is continuous iﬀall the composite maps πα◦f : Z →Xα, α ∈A, are continuous.
(ii) The subspace topology: Let Y be a subset of the topological space X. The
canonical map
j : Y →X
is given by j(x) := x. By deﬁnition, the subspace topology on Y is the projective
topology with respect to the map j. This is the weakest topology on Y such
that the canonical map j is continuous. Explicitly, a subset S of Y is open iﬀ
there exists an open set O in X such that S = O ∪Y. Let Z be a topological
space. The map
f : Z →Y
is continuous iﬀthe composite map j ◦f : Z →X is continuous.
4.5.5 Inductive and Projective Limits
The notion of limit for sequences in a topological space can be general-
ized to the limit of mathematical structures (e.g., linear spaces, groups,
topological spaces).
Folklore
The prototype of an inductive limit is the union

(4.39)
of a sequence X0 ⊆X1 ⊆X2 ⊆. . . of linear spaces X0, X1, . . . over K with the
additional property that Xk is a linear subspace of Xk+1 for all k = 0, 1, . . . Obvi-
ously, ∪∞
n=0Xn is again a linear space over K. The prototype of a projective limit
is the intersection

tional property that Xk+1 is a linear subspace of Xk for all k = 0, 1, . . . Obviously,
∩∞
n=0Xn is again a linear space over K. We want to generalize this.

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
• The inductive limit will be a quotient space of the coproduct.
• The projective limit will be a subspace of the Cartesian product.
The inductive (resp. projective) limit is also called the direct (resp. inverse) limit.
These limits were introduced in topology in about 1930. Let A be a directed set
(e.g., A = N).

παβ(x) := x for all α, β = 0, 1, 2, . . . with α ≤β.
(i) Linear spaces: We are given the commutative diagrams (4.41) where Xα, Xβ, Xγ
are linear spaces over K, and παβ, πβγ, πβγ are linear morphisms. Furthermore,
we assume that παα = id for all α ∈A. For the elements (α, x), (β, y) of the
coproduct ‘
α∈A Xα, we write
(α, x) ∼(β, y)
iﬀthere exists an index γ such that α, β ≤γ, and παγ(x) = πβγ(y). This is an
equivalence relation on ‘
α∈A Xα. We write
lim
α∈A ind Xα :=
 a

and call this the inductive limit of the diagram (4.41). This inductive limit is
a linear space over K. The canonical maps
iα : Xα →lim
α∈A ind Xα
are deﬁned by iα(x) := [(α, x)]. Let Z be a linear space over K. The map
f : lim
α∈A ind Xα →Z
is linear iﬀall the maps f ◦iα : Xα →Z, α ∈A, are linear.
(ii) Topological spaces: The situation (i) can be immediately generalized to the cat-
egory of topological spaces by replacing linear spaces (resp. linear morphisms)
by topological spaces (resp. continuous maps).
Now let us investigate the dual situation.

we assume that παα = id for all α ∈A. By deﬁnition, an element (xα) of the
product set Q
α∈A Xα is called a thread iﬀβ ≤γ always implies xβ = πβγ(xγ).
The set of all threads is denoted by

4.5.6 Classes, Sets, and Non-Sets
A traveller who refuses to pass over a bridge until he has personally tested
the soundness of every part of it is not likely to go far; something must be
risked, even in mathematics.
Horace Lamb (1849–1934)
On the 7th of December 1873, the theory of sets left behind forever its
age of innocence, for on that day Georg Cantor (1845–1918) proved that
the set of real numbers is uncountable. . . In 1901 Bertrand Russel (1872–
1970) discovered the inconsistency of the comprehension axiom (Russel’s
antinomy). . . In 1908 Ernst Zermelo (1871–1953) proposed a system of
axioms for set theory which heralded a new approach. . .
By a theorem of mathematical logic, proved in 1931 by Kurt G¨odel (1906–
1978), the consistency of the set-theoretic axiom systems cannot be proved
without methodological means beyond those they represent.43
Heinz-Dieter Ebbinghaus, 1995.
No one should ever drive us from the paradise which Cantor (1845–1918)
created for us.44
David Hilbert (1862–1943)
The theory of sets was created by Georg Cantor. This was motivated by the question
about the uniqueness of the trigonometric Fourier expansion in the case where
the convergence of the Fourier series is violated in an inﬁnite number of points.45

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
This way, Cantor was led to the study of the structure of inﬁnite sets. In about
1900 mathematicians were shocked by discovering contradictions in set theory. For
example, in 1901 Russel showed that the notion ‘set of all sets’ is contradictory. A
detailed discussion of this antinomy (and the diﬀerent axiomatic ways of avoiding
this diﬃculty due to Zermelo–Fraenkel and von Neumann–Bernays–G¨odel) can be
found in the article by Ebbinghaus (1995) quoted above.
Von Neumann’s idea of classes. In 1925, the young John von Neumann
(1903–1957) showed how to avoid such contradictions. He introduced the notion of
class. By deﬁnition, a class is a collection of objects.
• A class is called a set iﬀit can be the element of some class.
• A class is called a non-set iﬀit can never be an element of a class.
Thus, sets can be gathered into collections. Non-sets, intuitively speaking, are so
large that they cannot be gathered into larger collections. For example, the class U
of all sets is a non-set. This class is called the universe. Moreover, the class of all
linear spaces (or groups, rings, ﬁelds, Hilbert spaces, topological spaces) is a non-
set. Intuitively, the class of linear spaces cannot be a set, since there exist linear
spaces of arbitrarily high cardinality. The rigorous approach to classes has to be
based on axioms. A detailed study can be found in:
D. Klaua, General Set Theory, Akademie-Verlag, Berlin, 1964, Vols. 1, 2
(in German).
We also recommend the article on set theory by Ebbinghaus (1995) quoted above
and the following books:

Holland, Amsterdam, 1973.

Springer, New York, 1997.
The axioms are the starting point; they formulate formal terms like ‘class’, ‘set’,
and ‘non-set’ together with formal relations and operations between them. Pierre
Cartier writes:
A very important feature of an axiomatic system in mathematics is its non-
contradiction; after G¨odel’s work in 1931, we have lost the initial hopes to
establish the non-contradiction of mathematics by a formal reasoning, but
one can live with a corresponding belief in non-contradiction.46
The outstanding philosopher and mathematician Bertrand Russel (1872–1970) re-
marked:
Thus mathematics may deﬁned as the subject in which we never know
what we are talking about, nor whether what we are saying is true.
Zermelo’s axiom of choice. One of the cornerstones in the foundations of
class theory is the sophisticated axiom of choice, which reads as follows for the
universe U:

4.5 The Strategy of Partial Ordering
247
There exists a map C : U →U such that the image C(S) of any nonempty
set S is equal to some one-point set {s} where s is an element of S.
Intuitively, the map C selects precisely one element s from each nonempty set S.
Therefore, C is called a selection map. The axiom of choice ﬁrst formulated by
Zermelo (1871–1953) in 1908 seems to be trivial, but it is not trivial at all. One of
the surprising results of set theory is the fact that the axiom of choice is independent
of the remaining axioms of set theory. That is, one can postulate either the validity
or the non-validity of the axiom of choice.47
In the present series of monographs, we will use classes, and we will always
assume that the axiom of choice is valid.
Most of mathematicians use this convention. As a consequence, we will have the
lemma of Zorn at hand, as a general existence principle in mathematics. A typical
application of Zorn’s lemma will be considered in Problem 4.10 on page 259. From
a pragmatic point of view, the lemma of Zorn is an extremely useful tool in math-
ematics. Therefore, we do not want to loose this gadget. The axiom of choice has
the following consequences which are very far from common sense:
(i) The existence of non-measurable sets: There exist an inﬁnite number of subsets
of the real line which are not measurable in the sense of Lebesgue. In other
words, the elementary pre-measure for intervals on the real line cannot be
extended to a translation-invariant measure on the real line which allows us to
assign a measure to all subsets of the real line.
(ii) Cantor’s well-ordering principle: Any set can be well-ordered.
(iii) Obviously, the set of real numbers is not well-ordered with respect to the
usual ordering. For example, the open interval ]0, 1[ has no smallest element.
However, by (ii), there exists another (highly abstract) total ordering on the
real line for which the real line is well-ordered.
For the proof of (i), see E. Stein and R. Shakarchi, Princeton Lectures in Analysis
III: Measure Theory, p. 24, Princeton University Press, 2003. The proof of (ii) can
be based on Zorn’s lemma (see N. Dunford and J. Schwartz, Linear Operators, Vol.
I, Sect. I.2.9, Wiley, New York, 1958).
4.5.7 The Fixed-Point Theorem of Bourbaki–Kneser
Theorem 4.25 The map f : N →N on a nonempty partially ordered set N
has a ﬁxed-point (i.e., the equation f(x) = x has a solution) if the following two
conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) x ≤f(x) for all x ∈N.
(ii) Each nonempty totally ordered subset of N has a supremum.
For the map f : [0, 1] →[0, 1], the simple intuitive meaning of this ﬁxed-point
theorem is pictured in Fig. 4.14. This innocently looking theorem is one of the
cornerstones of set theory. The fairly sophisticated proof of this theorem can be
found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. I, Sect. 11.8 (see the references on page 1049). Observe
that the proof does not use the axiom of choice.

4.5.8 Zorn’s Lemma
Theorem 4.26 A nonempty partially ordered set contains a maximal element if
each nonempty, totally ordered subset has an upper bound.
This is one of the most important existence principles in mathematics. The
proof of this theorem follows from the Bourbaki–Kneser theorem and the axiom
of choice. This proof can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. I, p. 511. Next we want
to show how non-standard analysis can be based on Zorn’s lemma by constructing
ultraﬁlters.
4.6 Leibniz’s Inﬁnitesimals and Non-Standard Analysis
Extend the ﬁeld R of classical real numbers to the ﬁeld ∗R of generalized
real numbers in order to get inﬁnitesimal numbers and inﬁnite numbers.
Folklore
Non-standard analysis was introduced by Abraham Robinson (1918–1974) in 1960.
The goal of non-standard analysis is to rigorously justify the elegant Leibniz calculus
of inﬁnitesimals. In particular, we will prove that a classical real function f : R →R
has the classical derivative f ′(x) at the point x iﬀthe diﬀerence
df(x)
dx
−f ′(x)
is an inﬁnitesimal number for all nonzero inﬁnitesimal numbers dx. Here, we use
the Leibniz diﬀerential
df(x) := f(x + dx) −f(x).
The point is that the diﬀerential quotient df(x)
dx
is indeed a quotient, in the strict
algebraic sense, between the generalized numbers df(x) and dx. In addition, we have
to show that the expression f(x + dx) makes sense. To this end, we will uniquely
extend the classical function f : R →R to a function
f : ∗R
→∗R,
where ∗R contains the non-standard numbers x + dx. The point is that the totally
ordered ﬁeld ∗R is an extension of the classical totally ordered ﬁeld R.
Main ideas. Let us ﬁrst summarize the key properties. The rigorous justiﬁca-
tion will be considered below.
• Generalized numbers: The classical set R of real numbers can be extended to a
larger set ∗R whose elements are called generalized numbers.

4.6 Leibniz’s Inﬁnitesimals and Non-Standard Analysis
249
• Operations: Sums a + b, products ab and inequalities a ≤b for real numbers can
be extended to generalized numbers by preserving the usual rules. In particular,
for each nonzero generalized number a, there exists a unique generalized number
a−1 such that
aa−1 = a−1a = 1.
Moreover, if a and b are generalized numbers, then
a ≤b
or
b ≤a.
For all generalized numbers a, we deﬁne the modulus by setting
|a| :=
(
a
if
a > 0,
0
if
a ≤0.
• Inﬁnite numbers: In contrast to the set R of real numbers, the extended set ∗R
contains both nonzero inﬁnitesimal numbers and inﬁnite numbers. By deﬁnition,
a generalized number ω is called a positive (resp. negative) inﬁnite number iﬀ
r ≤ω
for all real numbers r
(resp. ω ≤r for all real numbers r). Naturally enough, a generalized number a
is called ﬁnite iﬀit is not an inﬁnite number. This is equivalent to saying that
there exist real numbers r and s such that r ≤a ≤s.
• Inﬁnitesimal numbers: A generalized number a is called an inﬁnitesimal number
(or brieﬂy an inﬁnitesimal) iﬀ
|a| < ε
for all real numbers ε > 0.
Trivially, the real number a = 0 is an inﬁnitesimal. Nonzero inﬁnitesimals are
not contained in R, but in the extended set ∗R.
• The sum α + β and the product αβ of inﬁnitesimals α and β are again inﬁnites-
imals.
• The inverse α−1 of a positive (resp. negative) inﬁnitesimal is a positive (resp.
negative) inﬁnite number.
• The product aα of a real number a with an inﬁnitesimal α is an inﬁnitesimal.48
Summarizing, for a generalized number a, only the following three alternatives are
possible:
(i) a is a real number;
(ii) a is an inﬁnite number;
(iii) a = r + α, where r is a real number, and α is a nonzero inﬁnitesimal.
In case (iii), r is called the standard part of the generalized number a. The standard
part is uniquely determined by a. Precisely the generalized numbers from (ii) and
(iii) are called non-standard numbers.
Now we are going to rigorously justify the notion of generalized numbers. To
this end, we need the following concepts:
• totally ordered ﬁeld,
• ultraﬁlter,
• ultra-coﬁnite set.
48 Further rules can be found in Problem 4.8 on page 258.

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
As an essential ingredient, we will use Zorn’s lemma (based on the axiom of choice)
in order to ensure the existence of ultraﬁlters. Let us discuss this. A totally ordered
ﬁeld X is deﬁned to be a ﬁeld which has the following additional properties for all
a, b ∈X:
• X is a totally ordered set.
• a ≤b and c ≤d imply a + c ≤b + d.
• a ≤b and 0 ≤c ≤d imply ac ≤bd.
For example, the ﬁeld R of real numbers is a totally ordered ﬁeld. Our goal is to
extend R to the totally ordered ﬁeld ∗R.
4.6.1 Filters and Ultraﬁlters
Filters. By a ﬁlter F of the nonempty set X, we understand a nonempty family
of subsets of X such that the following hold.
• If A, B ∈F, then A ∩B ∈F, and the intersection A ∩B is not empty.
• If A ∈F and A ⊆B ⊆X, then B ∈F.
For example, let x be a given point on the real line X := R. Then the set of all
open intervals J with x ∈J forms a ﬁlter of the real line.
Ultraﬁlters. A ﬁlter U of X is called an ultraﬁlter iﬀit is maximal with respect
to inclusion. Explicitly, there is no ﬁlter F of X with U ⊆F and F ̸= U.
Proposition 4.27 Each ﬁlter of a nonempty set X is contained in some ultraﬁlter
of X.
Proof. Let F(X) denote the set of all ﬁlters of X. Observe that F(X) is a partially
ordered set with respect to inclusion “⊆”. Let the family {Fα} of ﬁlters Fα be a
totally ordered subset of F(X), that is, we have Fα ⊆Fβ or Fα ⊆Fβ for all indices
α, β. Deﬁne the union
B :=
[
α
Fα
of the ﬁlters Fα. Then, the family B of subsets of X is a ﬁlter of X. In addition,
we have Fα ⊆B for all indices α. Thus, B is an upper bound of the subset {Fα}
of the partially ordered set F(X). By the Zorn lemma on page 248, the set F(X)
contains a maximal element U. This is the desired ultraﬁlter.
2
Proposition 4.28 Let U be an ultraﬁlter of the partially ordered set X. Then, for
each nonempty subset A of X, we have either A ∈U or (X \ A) ∈U.
The proof of this complementarity principle for ultraﬁlters will be given in Problem
4.5 on page 258.
The role played by high abstraction. Ultraﬁlters are highly abstract objects
far away from our intuition. We only know the existence of such objects. But we
will see in the next section that ultraﬁlters are extremely useful in order to give the
Leibniz inﬁnitesimals a sound mathematical basis.
This kind of high abstraction is typical for parts of modern mathematics, like the
theory of motives in both modern number theory and modern algebraic geometry.
For example, we refer to the survey article by
Y. Andr´e, Une introduction aux motives: motifs pures, motifs mixtes,
p´eriodes, Panoramas et Syth`eses 17 (2004) (in French).

4.6 Leibniz’s Inﬁnitesimals and Non-Standard Analysis
251
There are hints in recent research papers that possibly the rigorous justiﬁcation
of quantum ﬁeld theory has to be based on highly abstract objects. For example,
this concerns the motivic Galois group introduced by Connes and Marcolli, in the
framework of the Tannakian category. Roughly speaking, the motivic Galois group
contains the information about all possible one-dimensional renormalization groups
in quantum ﬁeld theory. For details, we refer to the recent monograph by
A. Connes and M. Marcolli, Noncommutative Geometry, Quantum Fields,
and Motives, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, Rhode Island, 2008.

4.6.2 The Full-Rigged Real Line
Non-standard analysis adds inﬁnitesimals and inﬁnite numbers to the clas-
sical real line.
Folklore
Ultra-coﬁnite sets of natural numbers. Let N := {0, 1, 2, . . .} denote the set
of natural numbers. A subset of N is called coﬁnite iﬀits complement is ﬁnite. For
example, the sets N and {2, 3, 4, . . .} are coﬁnite. The family of coﬁnite sets forms
a ﬁlter F of N, which is called the Fr´echet ﬁlter. By Prop. 4.27, there exists an
ultraﬁlter U which contains the Fr´echet ﬁlter F. Explicitly, the family U of subsets
of natural numbers has the following four properties.
(i) Intersection property: If A, B ∈U, then A ∩B ∈U, and the intersection A ∩B
is not empty.
(ii) Extension property: If A ∈U and A ⊆B ⊆N, then B ∈U.
(iii) Coﬁnite sets: Each coﬁnite set of N is contained in U.
(iv) Complementarity: For each nonempty subset S of N, one has either S ∈U or
(N \ S) ∈U.
The set U is not uniquely determined. To show this, consider the two sets Neven and
Nodd of even and odd natural numbers, respectively. These two sets are not coﬁnite.
Suppose that the family U satisﬁes the conditions (i)–(iv). By (iv), U contains either
Neven or Nodd. Thus, U is diﬀerent from the Fr´echet ﬁlter. Furthermore, we will
show in Problem 4.6 that there exist two families Ueven and Uodd which satisfy the
conditions (i)–(iv) and contain the set Neven and Nodd, respectively.
In what follows, we will ﬁx a family U which has the properties
(i)–(iv) above.
The elements of U are called ultra-coﬁnite subsets of N. In particular, coﬁnite sets
of natural numbers are always ultra-coﬁnite. By the complementarity principle for
ultraﬁlters (Prop. 4.28), ﬁnite sets of natural numbers are never ultra-coﬁnite.
The construction of generalized numbers. Let us consider sequences (an)
of real numbers, n = 1, 2, .... We write
an = bn
a.e.
(almost everywhere)
iﬀthere is a coﬁnite set C such that an = bn for all n ∈C. More generally, we use
the notation
an = bn
u.a.e.
(ultra-almost everywhere)
iﬀthere is an ultra-coﬁnite set U such that an = bn for all n ∈U. Since coﬁnite
sets are ultra-coﬁnite,
an = bn
a.e.
implies
an = bn
u.a.e.

252
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
Let us now pass to the key deﬁnition of non-standard analysis. For two sequences
(an) and (bn) of real numbers, we write
(an) ∼(bn)
iﬀ
an = bn
u.a.e.
The intersection property (i) of U guarantees that this is an equivalence relation.
Deﬁne
∗R := set of all equivalence classes [(an)].
The equivalence classes [(an)] are called generalized numbers. We equip the set ∗R
of generalized numbers with a sum, a product and a ≤-relation by setting
[(an)] + [(bn)] := [an + bn],
[(an)][(bn)] := [anbn],
and
[(an)] ≤[(bn)]
iﬀ
an ≤bn
u.a.e.
We have to show that this deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the repre-
sentatives. For example, this is true for sums. In fact,
an = cn
and
bn = dn
u.a.e.
imply
an + bn = cn + dn
u.a.e.,
by the intersection property (i) of U. Hence
an ∼cn
and
bn ∼dn
imply
(an + bn) ∼(cn + dn).
The same argument applies to products. For inequalities, observe that if
an ≤bn,
an = cn
bn = dn
u.a.e.,
then cn ≤dn u.a.e.
Theorem 4.29 The set ∗R is a totally ordered ﬁeld.
Proof. From an + bn = bn + an we obtain the commutative law
[(an)] + [(bn)] = [(bn)] + [(an)].
Similarly, one obtains all of the other laws. Let us only consider two facts that are
not completely obvious.
(I) Ordering. Let us show that
[(an)] ≤[(bn)]
or
[(bn)] ≤[(an)].
In fact, if an ≤bn u.a.e., then [(an)] ≤[(bn)]. Suppose now that an ≤bn u.a.e. is not
true. By the complementarity property of U, an > bn u.a.e. Hence [(bn)] ≤[(an)].
(II) Inverse element. Let [(an)] ̸= 0. By (I), [(an)] > 0 or [(an)] < 0. Suppose
that [(an)] > 0, i.e., an > 0 u.a.e. Hence there exists a set A ∈U such that an > 0
for all n ∈A. Deﬁne
bn :=
(
a−1
n
if
n ∈A,
0
if
n ̸∈A.
Then, anbn = 1 for all n ∈A. In other words, anbn = 1 u.a.e., and hence
[(an)][(bn)] = [(1)].
2

4.6 Leibniz’s Inﬁnitesimals and Non-Standard Analysis
253
Observe that the arguments (I) and (II) above do not work if we restrict our-
selves to coﬁnite index sets. For example, suppose that we have
an > bn
for all
n = 2, 4, 6, . . .
and an < bn for all n = 1, 3, 5, . . . Then the relation an ≤bn a.e. is not satisﬁed.
But this does not imply that an > bn a.e. This explains why we use the more
complicated concept of ultra-coﬁnite sets. A special role is played by equivalence
classes [(r)] of constant sequences (r).
We can identify real numbers r with generalized numbers [(r)].
This way, we regard ∗R as an extension of R. In particular, each real number is also
a generalized number. In what follows, we will frequently write r instead of [(r)].
To make this identiﬁcation precise, deﬁne the map
ϕ(r) := [(r)]
for all
r ∈R.
Obviously, from [(r)] + [(s)] = [(r + s)] and [(r)][(s)] = [(rs)] we get
ϕ(r + s) = ϕ(r) + ϕ(s)
and
ϕ(r)ϕ(s) = ϕ(rs).
This tells us that the map ϕ is an isomorphism from R onto ϕ(R) which also
preserves the ≤-relation. In particular,
s ≤[(an)] ≤r
means that s ≤an ≤r u.a.e.
Example 4.30 Let an := 1
n. Obviously, −ε < 1
n < ε a.e., and hence
−ε < [( 1
n)] < ε
for all real numbers
ε > 0.
Thus, the generalized number [( 1
n)] is a nonzero inﬁnitesimal.
Let an := n. Obviously, r ≤n a.e., and hence
r ≤[(n)]
for all real numbers
r.
Thus, [(n)] is a positive inﬁnite number.
Similarly, we obtain the following:
• ([(an)] is an inﬁnitesimal if an →0 as n →∞, and
• [(an)] is a positive inﬁnite number if an →+∞as n →∞.
The standard part of ﬁnite generalized numbers. For generalized num-
bers a, b, we write
a ≈b
iﬀthe diﬀerence a −b is an inﬁnitesimal. In this case, we also say that a and b are
inﬁnitesimal neighbors.
Proposition 4.31 For each ﬁnite generalized number a, there exists a unique real
number r such that a ≈r.

254
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
Proof. Uniqueness. If a ≈r and a ≈s, then the real number r−s is an inﬁnitesimal,
and hence r = s.
Existence. Set a := [(an)]. Since the generalized number a is ﬁnite, there exist
real numbers r and s such that
s ≤[(an)] ≤r.
Hence s ≤an ≤r u.a.e. Construct the set A := {r ∈R : an ≤r u.a.e }. Since this
set of real numbers is bounded from below, there exists the inﬁmum, inf(A). For
each real number ε > 0,
|an −inf (A)| < ε
u.a.e.
This implies the desired relation [(an)] ≈inf(A).
2
Extension of functions. Naturally enough, each real function f : R →R can
be uniquely extended to a function f : ∗R →∗R by letting
f([(an)]) := [f(an)].
This deﬁnition does not depend on the choice of the representative, since an = bn
u.a.e. implies f(an) = f(bn) u.a.e.
Theorem 4.32 (convergence). Let r and x0 be real numbers. For each real function
f : R →R, the following two statements are equivalent:
(i) limx→x0 f(x) = r.
(ii) f(x0 + dx) ≈r for all inﬁnitesimals dx ̸= 0.
Proof. (i) ⇒(ii). For each real number ε > 0, there exists a real number δ(ε) > 0
such that
0 < |x −x0| < δ(ε)
implies
|f(x) −r| < ε.
Let dx := [(an)]. Choose ε > 0. From 0 < |an| < δ(ε) u.a.e we get
|f(x0 + an) −r| < ε
u.a.e.
This is true for all ε > 0. Hence the number
f([(x0 + an)]) −r = [(f(x0 + an) −r)]
is an inﬁnitesimal.
(ii) ⇒(i) (indirect argument). Suppose that limx→x0 f(x) = r is not true. Then
there exist a real number ε > 0 and a real sequence (an) such that
lim
n→∞an = x0,
an ̸= x0
and
|f(an) −r| ≥ε
for all
n ∈N.
Set dx := [(an)] −x0. Then, dx is a nonzero inﬁnitesimal. From the assumption (ii)
we get f(x0 + dx) ≈r. Hence |f(an) −r| < ε u.a.e. This is a contradiction.
2
Corollary 4.33 Let r ∈R. For each real function f : R →R, the following two
statements are equivalent:
(i) limx→+∞f(x) = r.
(ii) f(ω) ≈r for all inﬁnite numbers ω > 0.
This follows analogously to the proof of the preceding theorem.
Leibniz diﬀerentials and the diﬀerential quotient. We are given a real
function f : R →R. Deﬁne the Leibniz diﬀerential by the quite natural relation
df(x) := f(x + dx) −f(x).

4.6 Leibniz’s Inﬁnitesimals and Non-Standard Analysis
255
Theorem 4.34 The following two statements are equivalent:
(i) The classical derivative f ′(x) exists.
(ii) For all inﬁnitesimals dx ̸= 0, we have df(x)
dx
≈f ′(x).
Proof. Let dx = [(hn)]. Introduce the function g : R →R by letting
g(h) := f(x + h) −f(x)
h
if
h ̸= 0,
and g(0) := 0. According to Theorem 4.32 on convergence, the following two state-
ments are equivalent:
(i) limh→0 g(h) = f ′(x).
(ii) g(dx) ≈f ′(x) for all inﬁnitesimals dx ̸= 0.
Finally, observe that
df(x)
dx
= f(x + dx) −f(x)
dx
= [f(x + hn) −f(x)]
[(hn)]
= [g(hn)] = g(dx).
This ﬁnishes the proof.
2
Example 4.35 (product rule). Consider two functions f, g : R →R which have
the derivatives f ′(x) and g′(x) at the point x. Then, the product function fg has
the deriviative (fg)′(x) = f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x).
In fact, for all inﬁnitesimals dx ̸= 0, we obtain
d(fg)(x)
dx
= f(x + dx)g(x + dx) −f(x)g(x)
dx
= f(x + dx) −f(x)
dx
g(x + dx) + g(x + dx) −g(x)
dx
f(x).
Since g(x + dx) ≈g(x) + g′(x)dx, we get
d(fg)(x)
dx
≈f ′(x)g(x) + g′(x)f(x) + f ′(x)g′(x)dx.
The product of an inﬁnitesimal with a real number is again an inﬁnitesimal. There-
fore, f ′(x)g′(x)dx is an inﬁnitesimal. Hence
d(fg)(x)
dx
≈f ′(x)g(x) + f(x)g′(x).
Finally, use Theorem 4.34.
2
Inﬁnite sums. Consider the sum
S(n) :=
n
X
j=1
cj,
n = 1, 2, . . .
Extend the values S(n) to a piecewise constant function S : R →R by letting
S(x) :=
(
S(n)
if
n ≤x < n + 1,
n = 1, 2, . . . ,
0
if
x < 1.

256
4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
As we have shown above, the function S can be uniquely extended to a function
S : ∗R →∗R. Let ω > 0 be a positive inﬁnite number. By convention, the symbol
ω
X
j=1
cj
stands for S(ω). Let r be a real number. In terms of classical convergence,
∞
X
j=1
cj = r
iﬀ
lim
x→+∞S(x) = r.
Thus, by Corollary 4.33, the following two statements are equivalent:
(i) P∞
j=1 cj = r.
(ii) Pω
j=1 cj ≈r for all inﬁnite numbers ω > 0.
Integrals. Let f : [a, b] →R be a continuous function on the compact interval
[a, b]. Deﬁne the sum
S(n) :=
n
X
j=1
f(xj)Δx,
n = 1, 2, . . . ,
where Δx := (b−a)/n and xj := a+jΔx. Construct S(x) as above. It follows from
classical calculus that
lim
x→+∞S(x) =
Z b
a
f(x)dx.
Thus, in terms of non-standard analysis,
S(ω) ≈
Z b
a
f(x)dx
for all inﬁnite numbers ω > 0. Mnemonically, we write
ω
X
j=1
f(x + jdx)dx ≈
Z b
a
f(x)dx
for all inﬁnite numbers ω > 0, where dx := (b −a)/ω.
Incompleteness of the extended totally ordered ﬁeld ∗R. By deﬁnition,
a completely ordered set S is a totally ordered set with the following additional
property: If a subset of S has an upper bound, then it also has a supremum.
Proposition 4.36 The set of inﬁnitesimals has an upper bound, but no supremum
in ∗R.
The proof will be given in Problem 4.9. Thus, in contrast to the completely
ordered set R, the extended set ∗R is not completely ordered.
Non-standard mathematics. The idea of non-standard analysis can be ex-
tended to all branches of mathematics. This leads to the so-called non-standard
mathematics. A fundamental result of non-standard mathematics tells us that:
For each non-standard proof of a mathematical theorem on standard ob-
jects, there exists a proof within standard mathematics.

Solution: Observe ﬁrst that if F ∈F, then
F ∩(X \ A) ̸= ∅.
Otherwise, F ⊆A, and hence A ∈F. This is a contradiction to our assumption
A /∈F. Consider now the family G of all subsets C of X which have the following

4.5 The complementarity principle for ultraﬁlters. Prove Proposition 4.28 on page

(ii) There exists an ultraﬁlter Uodd of the set N of natural numbers that contains
the coﬁnite sets and the set Nodd of odd natural numbers.
(iii) Neven /∈Uodd and Nodd /∈Ueven.
Solution: Ad (i), (iii). The set Neven is not coﬁnite. By Problem 4.4, there
exists a ﬁlter G which contains the coﬁnite sets and the set Neven. The ﬁlter
G is contained in some ultraﬁlter which will be denoted by Ueven. Obviously,
Neven ∈Ueven. By the complementarity principle for ultraﬁlters on page 250,
the complement Nodd to the set Neven is not contained in the ultraﬁlter Ueven.

• The product ωμ of inﬁnite numbers is an inﬁnite number.
• The product aω of a nonzero real number a with an inﬁnite number ω is an
inﬁnite number.

Problems
259
Hint: If [(an)] and [(bn)] are inﬁnitesimals, then |an|, |bn| < ε u.a.e, and hence
|anbn| < ε2 for all ε > 0. Thus, the product [(an)][(bn)] is an inﬁnitesimal.
Furthermore, note that
[(n−1)][(rn)] = r,
[(n−2)][(n)] = [(n−1)],
[(n−1)][(n2)] = [(n)].
This shows that products between inﬁnitesimals and inﬁnite numbers can be
real numbers, inﬁnitesimals, or inﬁnite numbers.
4.9 Incomplete ordering of ∗R. Prove Prop. 4.36 on page 256.
Solution: The set S of inﬁnitesimals does not have a supremum. Otherwise, we
would have
α ≤sup(S) ≤r
for all real numbers r and all inﬁnitesimals α.
Thus, sup(S) is a nonzero inﬁnitesimal. Since 2·sup(S) is also an inﬁnitesimal,
we obtain a contradiction.
4.10 A typical application of Zorn’s lemma. Let X be a linear subspace of the linear
space Z over K = R, C. Show that there exists a linear subspace Y of Z such
that Z = X ⊕Y.
Solution: If X = Z, then choose Y := {0}. If X ̸= Z choose an element
z ∈Z \ X. Then, z ̸= 0, and we have
X ⊕span(z) ⊆Z.
In the case where the dimension of Z is ﬁnite, the proof follows easily by using
an induction argument with respect to the dimension of Z. In the case where
the space Z has an inﬁnite dimension of arbitrary cardinality, one has to use
transﬁnite induction. However, the easiest proof is obtained by applying Zorn’s
lemma. To this end, consider the family F of all linear subspaces L of Z with
L ∩X = {0}. With respect to inclusion ⊆, the set F is partially ordered.
Each nonempty, totally ordered subset of F has an upper bound, namely, the
union of the corresponding sets. By Zorn’s lemma, the set F has a maximal
element Y , which is the desired linear subspace. Otherwise, there would exist
an element z of Z with z /∈X ⊕Y , and the linear subspace span(Y, z) would
contradict the maximality of Y .
4.11 Proof of Proposition 3.2 on page 120. Solution:
(I) Auxiliary result. Let u ∈X with u ̸= 0. By Problem 4.10, there exists a
linear subspace Y of X such that X = span(u) ⊕Y. Deﬁne f(αu + y) := α for
all α ∈K, y ∈Y. Then Fu(f) = f(u) = 1.
(II) To prove the claim, assume that Fx = Fz. Then Fx−z = Fx −Fz = 0. We
have to show that x = y. In fact, assume that x −z ̸= 0. By (I), Fx−z ̸= 0.
This is a contradiction.
4.12 Construction of linear functionals. Let X be a linear subspace of the linear
space Z over K = R, C. Show that any linear functional F : X →K deﬁned on
the subspace X can be extended to a linear functional F : Z →K deﬁned on
the total space Z.
Solution: Choose a linear subspace Y of Z such that Z = X ⊕Y , and set
F(x + y) := F(x) for all x ∈X, y ∈Y.
4.13 Construction of a biorthogonal system. Let Z be a linear space over K = R, C.
Let b1, . . . , bn be linearly independent elements of Z. Show that there exist
elements b1, . . . , bn of the dual space Zd such that
bk(bl) = δk
l
k, l = 1, . . . , n.
Solution: Let X := span{b1, . . . , bn}. Deﬁne

4. The Strategy of Equivalence Classes in Mathematics
F(α1b1 + . . . + αnbn) := α1
for all
α1, . . . , αn ∈K.
This is a linear functional on X. By Problem 4.12, this functional can be
extended to a linear functional on Z, which we call b1. Analogously, we get
b2, . . . , bn.
4.14 Proof of Proposition 3.3 on page 121. Solution: By Problem 4.13, we construct
linear functionals xj ∈Xd and yk ∈Y d such that
xj(xr) = δj
r,
yk(ys) = δk
s ,
j, r = 1, . . . , n, k, s = 1, . . . , m.
Hence
(xr ⊗ys)(xj, yk) = xj(xr)yk(ys) = δj
rδk
s .
Now suppose that
X
r,s
αrsxr ⊗ys = 0.
Applying this to (xj, yk), we get αjk = 0 for all indices j, k.
4.15 The tensor product of linear spaces. Let X and Y be linear spaces over K
where K = R, C. We want to construct the tensor product X ⊗Y by using
equivalence classes. We start with the set Z of all formal ﬁnite sums of the
form
α1(x1, y1) + . . . + αn(xn, yn),
n = 1, 2, . . .
(4.43)
where x1, . . . , xn ∈X, y1, . . . , yn ∈Y , and α1, . . . , αn ∈K. In a natural sense,
the set Z becomes a linear space. Let L be the smallest linear subspace of Z
which contains all the sums
(αu + βx, y) −α(u, y) −β(x, y),
(x, αv + βy) −α(x, v) −β(x, y)
where u, x ∈X, v, y ∈Y , and α, β ∈K. Consider the factor space Z/L. For
the equivalence class [(x, y)] in Z/L, we write
x ⊗y := [(x, y)].
The linear hull of all the elements x ⊗y is called the tensor product X ⊗Y.
Explicitly, the elements of X ⊗Y have the form
α1(x1 ⊗y1) + . . . + αn(xn ⊗yn),
n = 1, 2, . . .
(4.44)
Show that the construction of L implies the typical product properties:
• (αu + βx) ⊗y = α(u ⊗y) + β(x ⊗y),
• x ⊗(αv + βy) = α(x ⊗v) + β(x ⊗y)
for all u, x ∈X, v, y ∈Y , and all α, β ∈K.
4.16 The basis property of the tensor product. Let b1, . . . , bn (resp. c1, . . . , cm) be
linearly independent elements of X (resp. Y ). Show that the elements bj ⊗ck
with j = 1, . . . , n and k = 1, . . . , m are linearly independent.
Solution: Choose the element (4.43) and deﬁne
{α1(x1, y1) + . . . + αn(xn, yn)}(f, g) := α1f(x1)g(y1) + . . . + αnf(xn)g(yn)
for all f ∈Xd and g ∈Y d. This is a bilinear functional on Xd × Y d. For
the elements of the space L, this bilinear functional vanishes identically. For
example,
{(x, v + y) −(x, v) −(x, y)}(f, g) = f(x)g(v + y) −f(x)g(v) −f(x)g(y) = 0

Problems
261
because of g(v + y) = g(v) + g(y). Thus, the deﬁnition
[α1(x1, y1) + . . . + αn(xn, yn)](f, g) := α1f(x1)g(y1) + . . . + αnf(xn)g(yn)
for all f ∈Xd, g ∈Y d does not depend on the choice of the representatives.
We write
(x ⊗y)(f, g) := [(x, y)](f, g) = f(x)g(y)
for all
f ∈Xd, g ∈Y d.
Similarly, {α1(x1 ⊗y1) + . . . + αn(xn, ⊗yn)}(f, g) is equal to
[α1(x1, y1) + . . . + αn(xn, yn)](f, g).
Now argue as in the proof of Problem 4.14.
Remark on some ismorphism. Both the tensor product constructed above and
the tensor product constructed on page 121 satisfy the properties (P) and (B)
formulated on page 121. Therefore, the two linear spaces are isomorphic in a
natural way, by writing the elements
α1(x1 ⊗y1) + . . . + αn(xn ⊗yn)
(4.45)
in the form P
j,k αjkbj ⊗bk (see page 121). Because of the basis property (B),
the complex coeﬃcients αjk are uniquely determined by the expression (4.45).
4.17 The tensor product of algebras. Let X and Y be algebras over K. Deﬁne the
product
(u, v)(x, y) := (ux, vy),
u, x ∈X, v, y ∈Y.
(4.46)
Show that the tensor product X ⊗Y becomes an algebra by (4.46).
Solution: First of all, the set Z introduced in Problem 4.15 becomes an algebra
with respect to the product (4.46). Moreover, L is an ideal of Z. To see this,
note that
(w, z){(x, v + y) −(x, v) −(x, y)} = (wx, z(v + y)) −(wx, zv) −(wx, zy).
The right-hand side is equal to (wx, zv + zy) −(wx, zv) −(wx, zy), which lives
in L. Similar arguments show that if ζ ∈Z and l ∈L, then ζl, lζ ∈L. Thus,
L is indeed an ideal of Z. Consequently, the quotient space Z/L is a quotient
algebra, and X ⊗Y is a subalgebra of Z/L. This proves Prop. 3.4.
Simpliﬁcation. First suppose that X and Y are linear spaces over K. Computa-
tions concerning the tensor product X ⊗Y can be simply performed as follows.
Consider all the expressions (4.43) and add the following relations
(αu + βx, y) −α(u, y) −β(x, y) = 0, (x, αv + βy) −α(x, v) −β(x, y) = 0.
Finally, replace (x, y) by x ⊗y. If X and Y are algebras over K, then we add
the product (u, v)(x, y) = (ux, vy).

5. Geometrical Optics
In order to understand classical mechanics and quantum mechanics, one
has to understand geometrical optics.
The Huygens principle is the ﬁrst general principle in the history of physics,
which describes the propagation of physical eﬀects.
Folklore
The philosophers of antiquity speculated about the nature of light, being
familiar with burning glasses, with the rectilinear propagation of light, and
with refraction and reﬂection. The ﬁrst systematic writings on optics of
which we shave any deﬁnite knowledge are due to Greek philosophers and
mathematicians (Empedocles (490–430 B.C.) and Euclid (360–290 B.C.).1
Max Born and Emil Wolf, 1959
In 1636, the year in which Harvard College was founded, R´ene Descartes
(1596–1650) was putting his last hand to his Discourse sur la m´ethode de
bien conduire sa raison which contained among others his geometry and
also his dioptrics. In 1637, this book came into the hands of Pierre de
Fermat (1601–1665). In 1657 Fermat received from the physician of King
Louis XIV and of Mazarin, Cureau de la Chambre, in his time a very
reputed man who was also a physicist of note, a treatise about optics. In
the letter in which he acknowledged the receipt of this book, he stated
for the ﬁrst time his idea that the law of refraction might be deduced
from the minimum principle of shortest time, just like the Greek engineer
Heron of Alexandria (100 A.D.) had done for the reﬂection of light. . . In
a letter dated January 1, 1662, he announces to Cureau de la Chambre
that he found to his amazement that his principle was yielding a new
demonstration of Descartes’ refraction law . . .
Huygens (1629–1695) was working at the Paris Academy from 1666 until
1681. What Huygens did for optics is exactly the same thing which was
done two hundred years later by Maxwell (1831–1879) for electricity. Huy-
gens replaced Fermat’s long distance principle of least time by a ‘contact
principle’. The light waves of Huygens were exactly as hypothetical as the
atoms of Democritos (400 B.C.) . . .
The theory of Huygens was shortly afterwards killed by Newton (1643–
1727) who showed that it was inconsistent with the propagation of lon-
gitudinal waves and the possibility of the existence of transversal waves

had not been devised at yet.2 In consequence the inﬂuence of Huygens was
delayed for one hundred and twenty-ﬁve years if we consider the progress
in optics and was lost altogether for the progress of the Calculus of Vari-
ations . . .
The very ﬁrst solution for the brachistochrone problem which Johann
Bernoulli (1667–1748) found in 1696 contains the demonstration of the cru-
cial fact that the minimum is really attained for the cycloid . . . Bernoulli’s
method, in which something of the ﬁeld theory of Weierstrass (1815–1897)
appears for the ﬁrst time did not attract the attention even of Bernoulli’s
contemporaries and remained completely ignored for nearly two hundred
years. These two pages which I discovered by chance more than thirty
years ago, have had a very decisive inﬂuence on the work I myself did in
the Calculus of Variations. I succeeded gradually in simplifying the ex-
position of this theory and came ﬁnally to the point where I found to
my astonishment that the method to which I have directed through long
and hard work was contained, at least in principle, in the admirable book
Trait´e de la lumini´ere (Treatise on light) of Huygens from the year 1690.3
5.1 Ariadne’s Thread in Geometrical Optics
The following three equations describe light rays y = y(x), x ∈R and wave fronts
S(x, y) = const of light in the plane.
(i) The Euler–Lagrange equation of light rays:
d
dx
 
n(x, y(x)) · y′(x)
p

!
= ny(x, y)
p
1 + y′(x)2,
x ∈R.
(5.1)
The smooth function n : R2 →R with inf(x,y)∈R2 n(x, y) > 0 is the refraction
index. This means that a light ray passing through the point (x0, y0) has the
velocity
c
n(x0, y0)
at (x0, y0). Here, c is the velocity of the light in a vacuum. The crucial function
L : R3 →R given by
L(x, y, y′) := n(x, y)

p

2 According to Maxwell’s theory, light corresponds to transversal electromagnetic
waves. This means that the oscillating electric and magnetic ﬁelds are perpen-
dicular to the direction of propagation of light.

tion (5.1) looks like
d
dxLy′(x, y(x), y′(x)) = Ly(x, y(x), y′(x)),
x ∈R.
(5.2)
The real number y′(x) is called the slope of the light ray y = y(x) at the point
x. We also introduce the co-slope at x:
p(x) := y′(x) · n(x, y)

nian of geometrical optics. An elementary computation shows that the Euler–
Lagrange equation (5.1) is equivalent to (5.4). The crucial point is that a sym-
plectic geometry is behind (5.4). This will be discussed in Sect. 6.10.

(x, y) ∈R2.

The function S : R2 →is called the eikonal. In terms of the Hamiltonian H,
the eikonal equation can be written as
Sx + H(x, y, Sy) = 0.
The three equations (5.1), (5.4), and (5.5) reﬂect the duality between light rays and
wave fronts, as we will show below (Fig. 5.1).
Prototypes of solutions. Let us consider the special case of a vacuum:

Relation to point mechanics. Let us use the following substitution:
x ⇒t,
y ⇒q.
Then the light ray y = y(x) passes over to the motion q = q(t) of a mass point on
the real line. Moreover, the slope y′(x) passes over to the velocity (time derivative)
˙q(t). This way, it is possible to pass from geometrical optics to classical mechanics,
by using the appropriate Lagrangian L. In particular, the eikonal S having the
physical dimension of time passes over to the action S having the physical dimension
of energy times time.
Regular and singular behavior of light rays. In the regular situation, two
diﬀerent points are connected by a uniquely determined light ray. If the situation
is not regular (i.e., singular), light rays may intersect. We distinguish between
• isolated intersection points (focal points) and
• envelopes of light rays (caustics).
In real life, the light intensity of focal points and caustics is much larger than that of
regular conﬁgurations. In the second half of the 20th century, Arnold and his school
in Moscow thoroughly studied the classiﬁcation of singular behavior in geometrical
optics. This is closely related to the sophisticated theory of singularities in algebraic
geometry (Fig. 5.2).

Gravitational lenses. Suppose that the light coming from a distant quasar Q
in the universe passes through a galaxy. According to Einstein’s theory of general
relativity, the gravitational forces related to the galaxy cause refraction of light. This
means that the galaxy acts like a lens called gravitational lens. Astronomers observe
the same caustic eﬀects as for lenses in laboratories on earth. For example, there
exists one quasar which has four diﬀerent images in the Hubble Space Telescope.
This is the so-called Einstein cross.
Perspectives. Geometrical optics is closely related to the following mathemat-
ical subjects:
• duality between systems of ﬁrst-order ordinary diﬀerential equations (e.g., light
rays) and ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equations (e.g., wave fronts) in analysis,
• symplectic geometry,
• contact geometry,
• light rays and non-Euclidean geometry (geodesics, Riemannian geometry and
curvature, K¨ahler geometry).
It was discovered by Hamilton (1805–1865) that geometrical optics and point me-
chanics can be described by the same mathematics.
Light in Maxwell’s theory of electrodynamics. In 1873 Maxwell (1831–
1879) published his Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. For a fairly large class
of materials (without external charges and external currents), in an inertial system,
the Maxwell equations look like
curl E = −Bt,
curl H = Dt,
div D = 0,
div B = 0
(5.6)
together with the constitutive laws D = εE and B = μH.
Here, we use a Cartesian (x, y, z)-coordinate system, and E, D, B, H, ε, μ de-
pend on the point (x, y, z). Moreover, ε (resp. μ) are material functions called the
dielectricity (resp. magnetic permeability) function.4 The velocity of light in the
material at the point (x, y, z) is given by
cmatter(x, y, z) =
c
n(x, y, z) =
1
p
ε(x, y, z)μ(x, y, z)
,
where c is the velocity of light in a vacuum, and n(x, y, z) is the refraction index
at the point (x, y, z). The refraction index is caused by the interaction between
electromagnetic waves and the atoms of the material.
In Maxwell’s theory, light corresponds to electromagnetic waves.
Light rays are the streamlines of the energy ﬂow caused by the electric ﬁeld E and
the magnetic ﬁeld B. More precisely, the velocity vector ﬁeld of the energy ﬂow is
given by
v(x, y, z, t) := E(x, y, z, t) × H(x, y, z, t)
η(x, y, z, t)
,
where η = 1
2(ED + BH) is the electromagnetic energy density. Thus, the light rays
x = x(t) are the solutions of the diﬀerential equation
˙x(t) = v(x(t), t),
t ∈R.
Now to the point. Geometrical optics represents the short-wavelength limit
λ →0
4 In a vacuum, we have ε(x, y, z) ≡ε0 and μ(x, y, z) ≡μ0.

B(x, y, z, t) = B0(x, y, z) eiωS(x,y,z) · e−iωt + O(λ),

5.2 Fermat’s Principle of Least Time
Fermat’s principle reads as follows:
Light rays move in such a way that the travelling time is minimal.
The variational problem. Let the refraction index n : R2 →R be given as
on page 264. We are given the two points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) in R2 with x0 < x1.
We are looking for a smooth curve y = y(x), x0 ≤x ≤x1, which is a solution of
the following minimum problem:

light ray for passing from the point (x0, y0) to (x1, y1). In order to motivate (5.7),
let us divide the light ray curve y = y(x) into small pieces of length Δs. For the
velocity of light at the point (x, y(x)), we get

d

L(x, y(x) + εh(x), y′(x) + εh′(x)) dx.
This means that we replace the solution curve x →y(x) by the perturbed curve
x →y(x) + εh(x).
Since h(x0) = h(x1) = 0, the perturbed curve also passes through the two points
(x0, y0) and (x1, y1) (Fig. 5.3). Consequently, the function J has a minimum at the
point ε = 0. Hence J′(0) = 0. This implies

Suﬃcient condition for light rays. The main problem is to decide whether
a given solution y = y(x) of the Euler–Lagrange equation (5.8) is a solution of the
minimum problem (5.7). This will be studied in Sect. 5.4.
5.3 Huygens’ Principle on Wave Fronts
Huygens’ principle reads as follows:
Wave fronts are the envelopes of elementary waves.
Intuitively, this means the following. Consider a wave front Wt at ﬁxed time t. Each
point of Wt originates a family of elementary wave fronts. For any later time t+Δt,
the envelope of the elementary waves at time t + Δt forms the wave front at time
t + Δt.
For example, in a vacuum with refraction index n ≡1, the elementary wave
fronts are circles (Figs. 5.4 & 5.5). In the general case of an arbitrary refraction
index n, elementary waves are deformed circles (Fig. 5.6).
Heuristic motivation of Huygens’ principle. Let us investigate the regular
situation, that is, two diﬀerent points P and Q in the plane can always be connected
by precisely one light ray. By deﬁnition, the optical distance
d(P, Q)
between the two points P and Q is the time needed by a light ray for passing from
P to Q. We will essentially use geometric arguments based on the optical distance.
Consider the situation pictured in Fig. 5.7.

• Fix the point P0. Consider the wave front Wt := {P ∈R2 : d(P0, P) = t} in the
plane.
• For 0 < t < s, the corresponding wave fronts Wt, Ws cannot intersect each other.
In fact, suppose that Q ∈Wt ∩Ws. Then d(P0, Q) = t and d(P0, Q) = s with
t ̸= s, a contradiction.
• Choose a point P ∈Ws. The light ray connecting the point P0 with P intersects
the wave front Wt in the point Q0 (Fig. 5.7(a)). For the optical distance, we get
d(P0, P) = s and d(P0, Q0) = t. Hence d(Q0, P) = s −t.
• Consider the elementary wave front W := {Q ∈R2 : d(Q0, Q) = s−t} originated
at the point Q0.
• We claim that P is a contact point of the wave front Ws and the elementary wave
front W, as pictured in Fig. 5.7(b). To prove this, suppose that the claim is not
true. Then P is a proper intersection point between Ws and W. By Fig. 5.7(c),
there exists a point P1 ∈Wτ ∩W with τ > s. Naturally enough, we assume that
the triangle inequality is valid for the optical distance. Considering the triangle
P0Q0P1, we get
d(P0, P1) ≤d(P0, Q0) + d(Q0, P1).
Hence τ ≤t + (s −t) = s, a contradiction.
Short-range forces in nature. We distinguish between
• short-range forces and
• long-range forces.
The Huygens principle corresponds to a short-range force. In contrast to this, con-
sider the Newtonian equation
m¨x(t) = F(t),
t ∈R,
x(0) = x0,
˙x(0) = v0
for the motion of a point with mass m > 0 on the real line. We are given the smooth
force F : R →R and both the initial position x0 and the initial velocity v0 at time
t = 0. This problem has the unique solution
x(t) = x0 + v0t + 1
m
Z t

(t −τ)F(τ)dτ,
t ∈R.
If we change the initial position x0 at time t = 0, then the position x(t) of the
particle changes immediately at each time t > 0. Thus the force F has inﬁnite
range. (See also the discussion on Faraday’s locality principle in physics on page
13).
5.4 Carath´eodory’s Royal Road to Geometrical Optics
Once a day the Ptolemean king asked Euclid (ca. 360–290 B.C.) for show-
ing him an easy approach to mathematics. Euclid answered that there
is no ‘royal road’ to mathematics. The same anecdote is also told about
Alexander the Great (356–323 B.C.) and Aristotle (384–322 B.C.).
Folklore
Constantin Carath´eodory (1873–1950), a student of Hilbert (1862–1943)
and the leading expert in the calculus of variations, instinctively felt that
there must be a simple ‘royal road’ to the calculus of variations. He was
obsessed by the question “Why extremals play such a distinguished role?”
They are being used and they function fabulously, but how can one reason

out and show their necessity and simplicity? Carath´eodory’s wonderful
paper Die Methode der geod¨atischen ¨Aquidistanten, Acta Mathematica 47
(1925), 199–230, was the result of his investigations.5
Krystzof Maurin, 1997
Carath´eodory’s fundamental equation reads as
Sx(x, y) = L(x, y, v(x, y)) −v(x, y)Ly′(x, y, v(x, y)),
Sy(x, y) = Ly′(x, y, v(x, y)),
(x, y) ∈R.
(5.9)
We are given the smooth function L : R3 →R,
L(x, y, v) := n(x, y)v(x, y)
c
√
1 + v2
,
(x, y, v) ∈R3,
together with the smooth function n : R2 →R, where inf(x,y)∈R2 n(x, y) > 0. We
are looking for smooth functions
• v = v(x, y) (slope function) and
• S = S(x, y) (eikonal)
from R2 to R which satisfy (5.9). The smooth solutions y = y(x), x ∈R of the
so-called slope equation
y′(x) = v(x, y(x)),
x ∈R
(5.10)
are called the trajectories of (5.9). The set of all the solutions of (5.10) is called a
ﬁeld of trajectories. Note that two diﬀerent trajectories of the ﬁeld do not intersect
each other, since the solution of the initial-value problem for the slope equation
(5.10) is unique.6 Again let us consider Fermat’s minimum problem
Z x1

1 + y′(x)2 dx = min!,
y(x0) = y0, y(x1) = y1.
(5.11)
The following main theorem in geometrical optics tells us that the trajectories of the
ﬁeld are solutions of (5.11), that is, they are light rays. Furthermore, the equations
S(x, y) = const describe wave fronts.
Theorem 5.2 Let v, S : R2 →R be a smooth solution of Carath´eodory’s funda-
mental equation (5.9). Fix the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) in R2. Then the following
hold.
(i) Let y = y(x), x0 ≤x ≤x1 be a trajectory which corresponds to the slope
equation (5.10) and satisﬁes the boundary condition y(x0) = y0, y(x1) = y1. Such a
trajectory is a solution of the minimum problem (5.11).
(ii) The diﬀerence S(x1, y1)−S(x0, y0) is the optical distance between the points
(x0, y0) and (x1, y1). In other words,
S(x1, y1) −S(x0, y0) =

the following results are only valid locally. Fig. 5.8 shows a ﬁeld of trajectories
on the open set U.

(II) Let us introduce the Weierstrass excess function
E(x, y, v, w) := L(x, y, w) −L(x, y, v) −(w −v)Ly′(x, y, v).
By Taylor expansion, E(x, y, v, w) = Ly′y′(x, y, v∗) ≥0 for all x, y, v, w ∈R.
(III) The integral trick. Let y = η(x) be a smooth function with η(x0) = y0 and
η(x1) = y1. Then the integral

is equal to the diﬀerence S(x1, y1) −S(x0, y0).
(IV) Using Carath´eodory’s equation (5.9) and setting y := η(x), we get the key
relation
L(x, η(x), η′(x)) = Sx(x, η(x)) + Sy(x, η(x))η′(x) + E(x, η(x), v(x, η(x)), η′(x)).
By (II) and (III),
Z x1
x0
L(x, η(x), η′(x)) dx ≥S(x1, y1) −S(x0, y0).
(V) Choosing η(x) := y(x), it follows from y′(x) = v(x, y(x)) that
E(x, y(x), v(x, y(x)), y′(x)) ≡0.
Hence
Z x1

L(x, y(x), y′(x)) dx = S(x1, y1) −S(x0, y0).

Example (vacuum). Let n(x, y) ≡1. Then the functions
v(x, y) := 0,
S(x, y) = x
for all
(x, y) ∈R2
are solutions of Carath´eodory’s equation (5.9). This corresponds to the straight-line
light rays y(x) ≡const and the wave fronts x = const.
Hilbert’s invariant integral. Let v, S be a smooth solution of Carath´eodo-
ry’s equation (5.9). Then, for any smooth function y = η(x), the line integral

(5.12)
along the curve x = x, y = η(x) is equal to the diﬀerence S(x1, y1) −S(x0, y0).
That is, the line integral does not depend on the path. This follows as in step
(III) of the proof of the theorem above, noting that dy = η′(x)dx. The integral
(5.12) is called Hilbert’s invariant integral. In fact, Carath´eodory’s ‘royal road’
to geometrical optics and to the calculus of variations was strongly motivated by
Hilbert’s invariant integral, which is closely related to the Poincar´e–Cartan integral
invariant (see page 423).
5.5 The Duality between Light Rays and Wave Fronts
Legendre transformation. Recall that L(x, y, v) :=
n(x,y)
c
√
1 + v2. In order to
simplify the approach considered above, we will use the Legendre transformation
(x, y, v) →(x, y, p) and L(x, y, v) →H(x, y, p) by setting
p := Lv(x, y, v),
H := vp −L.

(5.13)
Carath´eodory’s fundamental equation (5.9) passes over to
Sy(x, y) = p(x, y),
Sx(x, y) = −H(x, y, p(x, y)).
This implies the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
Sx(x, y) + H(x, y, Sy(x, y)) = 0.
(5.14)
The Hamilton canonical equation for the light rays. As we have shown
on page 265, the Legendre transformation sends the Euler–Lagrange equation for
light rays to the Hamilton canonical equation (5.4) on page 265.
Contact transformation. The Legendre transformation satisﬁes the diﬀeren-
tial relation
dL −pdv = vdp −dH,
which is typical for contact transformations (see Sect. 5.7). In fact, by the product
rule for diﬀerentials, dH = d(pv) −dL = (dp)v + pdv −dL.
The classical maximum principle. Deﬁne
H(x, y, v, p) := pv −L(x, y, v)

where L(x, y, v) := n(x, y)(1 + v2)γ for all (x, y, v) ∈R3. Suppose ﬁrst that γ > 1
2.
Then, for any ﬁxed (x, y, p) ∈R3, we deﬁne
H(x, y, p) := max
v∈R
H(x, y, v, p).
Note that the function v →H(x, y, v, p) is strictly concave and goes to −∞as
v →±∞. Thus, the global maximum problem
H(x, y, v, p) = max!,
v ∈R
has a unique solution given by Hv(x, y, v, p) = 0. Hence
p = Lv(x, y, v) = 2γn(x, y)v(1 + v2)γ−1.
The map v →p is invertible. Hence
H(x, y, p) = H(x, y, v(p), p).
(5.15)
This corresponds to the Legendre transformation. In geometrical optics, we en-
counter the case where γ = 1
2. Then we have to consider the local problem
H(x, y, v, p) = critical!,
v ∈R.
This yields Hv(x, y, v, p) = 0. Again this implies (5.15).
In the sense of duality in general optimization theory (in the framework of
nonlinear functional analysis), the Hamiltonian H is the conjugate function to the
Lagrangian L (see Zeidler (1986), Vol. III, quoted on page 1049).
5.5.1 From Wave Fronts to Light Rays
Suppose that we have a smooth solution S = S(x, y), (x, y) ∈R, of the Hamilton–
Jacobi equation (5.14).7 Our goal is to construct a solution of Carath´eodory’s fun-
damental equation (5.9) on page 272. To this end, we ﬁrst deﬁne
p(x, y) := Sy(x, y),
(x, y) ∈R2.
Then we use the inverse Legendre transformation in order to get
v(x, y) :=
n(x, y)p(x, y)
c
q
n(x,y)2
c2
−p(x, y)2
,
(x, y) ∈R2.
This yields the solution S, v of (5.9). Light rays y = y(x) are obtained by using the
slope equation y′(x) = v(x, y(x)).
7 If S = S(x, y) is only a local solution, then the following argument is locally
valid.

5. Geometrical Optics
5.5.2 From Light Rays to Wave Fronts
Fix the point (x0, y0) ∈R2. Then the initial-value problem
Sx(x, y) + H(x, y, Sy(x, y)) = 0,
S(x0, y) = 0
(5.16)
has always a smooth solution S = S(x, y) in a suﬃciently small neighborhood of
the point (x0, y0). This is the special case of a general result for ﬁrst-order partial
diﬀerential equations due to Cauchy (1789–1857).8 Let us sketch the proof. We use
Cauchy’s characteristic system, which is an extension of the Hamilton canonical
equations:
y′(x) = Hp(x, y(x), p(x)),
y(x0) = η,
p′(x) = −Hy(x, y(x), p(x)),
p(x0) = 0,
σ′(x) = p(x)y′(x) −H(x, y(x), p(x)),
σ(x0) = 0.
(5.17)
This system can be solved by ﬁrst solving the Hamilton canonical equations for
getting y = y(x), p = p(x) and then computing
σ(x) =
Z x
x0
{p(x)y′(x) −H(x, y(x), p(x)}dx.
Varying the parameter η, we get the solutions y = y(x, η), σ = σ(x, η) of (5.17)
depending on η. Now the solution of (5.16) is obtained by setting
S(x, y(x, η)) := σ(x, η).
The solutions y = y(x), p = p(x), σ = σ(x) of (5.17) are called characteristics
of (5.16). The projections of the characteristics from the (x, p, σ)-space onto the
(y, p)-space are solutions of the Hamilton–Jacobi equations. Finally, the projections
y = y(x) are light rays starting at the wave front x0 = constant in the (x, y)-plane.
This shows that
In order to understand geometrical optics best, one has to pass to higher
dimensions.
The relation to Lagrangian submanifolds will be studied in Sect. 6.13 on page 419.
5.6 The Jacobi Approach to Focal Points

solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation (5.1). The corresponding Jacobi equation
reads as

Theorem 5.3 If the smallest eigenvalue of (5.18) is positive, then the given curve
y = y(x) is a solution of Fermat’s principle of least time (5.7).
The proof can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. III, p. 205, quoted on page 1049.
This proof generalizes the proof given on page 376 for the harmonic oscillator. Since
min
x0≤x≤x1 α(x) > 0,
the Jacobi eigenvalue problem (5.18) corresponds to a regular Sturm–Liouville prob-
lem.9 Such problems are special cases of the functional-analytic Hilbert–Schmidt
theory for compact self-adjoint operators in Hilbert space (see Zeidler (1995a),
Chap. 4, quoted on page 1049). The Sturm–Liouville problem (5.18) is called sin-
gular iﬀthe ﬁnite interval [x0, x1] is replaced by an inﬁnite interval, or the function
α = α(x) vanishes at least at one point of the interval. Typically, such singular
problems arise in quantum mechanics for investigating the spectrum of atoms or
molecules (e.g., the hydrogen atom). This will be studied in Vol. III. In terms
of functional analysis, singular Sturm–Liouville problems are treated by von Neu-
mann’s functional-analytic theory of unbounded self-adjoint operators in Hilbert
space (based on the spectral family).

Proof. Use the critical condition J′(0) = 0 and the same argument as in the proof
of Theorem 5.1.

Intuitively, extremals are light rays which run locally in minimal time, but not
globally. To explain this, as a paradigm, replace light rays by curves of minimal
length on the surface of earth. Choose two points P and Q on the equator as
pictured in Fig. 5.9(a).
The segment PAQ of the equator is a curve of minimal length. However, the
segment PBQ of the equator is only locally a curve of minimal length, but not
globally. The North Pole N and the South Pole S are the prototypes of focal points,
that is, the uniqueness of the connecting curve of minimal length is violated (Fig.
5.9(b)).
Focal points and Jacobi ﬁelds. Fix the points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1). Consider
the family
y = y(x, ε),
x0 ≤x ≤x1
of smooth extremals which pass through the focal points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) for
all parameters ε ∈] −ε0, ε0[ (Fig. 5.10).
The function y = h(x) deﬁned by
h(x) := yε(x, 0),
x0 ≤x ≤x1
is called the Jacobi ﬁeld of the family of extremals. By Taylor expansion,
y(x, ε) = y(x) + εh(x) + O(ε2),
ε →0,
x0 ≤x ≤x1,
where we set y(x) := y(x, 0). Thus the Jacobi ﬁeld describes the ﬁrst-order deviation
of the family of extremals from the special extremal x →y(x). If h(x) ≡0, then the
ﬁrst-order deviation vanishes. In particular, if there is a unique extremal y = y(x)
which connects the point (x0, y0) with the point (x1, y1), then a nontrivial Jacobi
ﬁeld does not exist.

5.7 Lie’s Contact Geometry
279
The equation (5.20) is a special case of the Jacobi eigenvalue problem (5.18)
with λ = 0.
By deﬁnition, the point (x1, y1) is conjugate to the point (x0, y0) iﬀthe Jacobi
equation (5.20) has a nontrivial solution, h(x) ̸≡0. In particular, the situation
considered in Theorem 5.3 corresponds to points (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) which are not
conjugate. Finally, consider a sphere of radius r as pictured in Fig. 5.9. It can be
shown that the points P and Q on the equator are conjugate iﬀtheir distance is
equal to πr. In particular, North Pole and South Pole are conjugate points.
5.7 Lie’s Contact Geometry
Contact geometry of dimension 2n + 1 (n = 1, 2, . . .) is based on contact
elements which are pairs (P, Π) of a point P and a 2n-dimensional plane
Π through the point P. Contact geometry is closely related to envelopes of
curves and surfaces (e.g., this concerns Huygens’ principle in geometrical
optics).
Contact transformations provide the general setting for transforming ordi-
nary and partial diﬀerential equations in such a way that solutions of the
original equation pass over to solutions of the transformed equation.
Folklore
Contact geometry does for geometric optics and the theory of wave prop-
agation what symplectic geometry does for mechanics. Both these geome-
tries and their isomorphisms were conceived by a single man – Sophus Lie
(1842–1899). The thesis that Lie is the father of both geometries is ﬁrmly
founded. . .
Lie regarded the theory of groups of contact transformations (founded in
1871) as his greatest discovery and achievement.10

5.7.1 Basic Ideas
Invariance of solutions of diﬀerential equations. In order to simplify the
solution of the diﬀerential equation
F(x, y(x), y′(x)) = 0,
x ∈R
(5.21)
one can use the point transformation ξ = a(x, y), η = b(x, y). This yields
G(ξ, η(ξ), η′(ξ)) = 0,
ξ ∈R.
(5.22)
However, it turns out that it is frequently convenient to use the more general
transformation
ξ = A(x, y, y′),
η = B(x, y, y′),
η′ = C(x, y, y′)
(5.23)
from R3 to R3. Quite naturally, we postulate:
Solutions of the diﬀerential equation (5.21) are transformed into solutions
of the diﬀerential equation (5.22).

5. Geometrical Optics
This restricts the possible transformations of the form (5.23). It turns out that
contact transformations are the right setting. To discuss this, let us use the language
of diﬀerentials. We write (5.21) and (5.22) as
F(x, y, y′) = 0,
dy −y′dx = 0
(5.24)
and
G(ξ, η, η′) = 0,
dη −η′dξ = 0.
(5.25)
Here, x, y, y′ and ξ, η, η′ are regarded as independent variables which are constrained
by the equations (5.24) and (5.25), respectively. The diﬀeomorphism (5.23) from
R3 onto R3 is called a contact transformation with respect to the contact forms
dy −y′dx and dη −η′dξ iﬀ, for any point (x, y, y′), there exists a nonzero real
number ϱ(x, y, y′) such that
dη −η′dξ = ϱ(x, y, y′)(dy −y′dx)
(5.26)
for all (x, y, y′) ∈R3.11 Observe that dy −y′dx = 0 implies dη −η′dξ = 0, by (5.26).

with the inverse transformation x = η′, y = ξη′ −η, y′ = ξ represents a contact
transformation. In fact,
dη −η′dξ = dx · y′ + xdy′ −dy −xdy′ = −(dy −y′dx).
The Legendre transformation sends solutions of the original diﬀerential equation
(5.21) to solutions of (5.22).
Example. Consider the Clairaut diﬀerential equation12
y −xy′ = g(y′).
(5.28)
By Legendre transformation, we get −η = g(ξ). The inverse Legendre transforma-
tion yields the parameterized solution
x = −g′(ξ),
y = −ξg′(ξ) + g(ξ),
ξ ∈R
of (5.28). Hence y = ξx+g(ξ), x ∈R. This is a family of straight lines parameterized
by the real parameter ξ.
In particular, let g(y′) := −1
2y′2. Then the Clairaut diﬀerential equation (5.28)
has the family of straight lines
y = xξ −1
2ξ2,
x ∈R,
(5.29)
as solutions where ξ is a parameter. Writing this family as F(x, y, ξ) = 0, the
envelope of this family is obtained from the equation
11 Expressing the diﬀerentials by partial derivatives, we get
Bxdx + Bydy + By′dy′ −C(Axdx + Aydy + Ay′dy′) = ϱ(dy −y′dx).
Comparing the coeﬃcients of dx, dy, dy′, we get the following system of ﬁrst-order
partial diﬀerential equations: Bx−CAx = −ϱy′, By −CAy = ϱ, By′ −CAy′ = 0.

Summarizing, the parabola (5.31) and the family (5.28) of its tangent lines form
solutions of the diﬀerential equation y −xy′ = −1
2y′2 (Fig. 5.11).
Geometric interpretation of the Legendre transformation. A smooth
curve C : y = (x) can be described in the following two ways, which are dual to
each other:
(i) The curve C is a set of points {(x, y(x)) : x ∈R}.
(ii) The curve C is the envelope of the family of its tangent lines.
The Legendre transformation passes from (i) to (ii). To explain this, consider the
smooth curve C : y = y(x) pictured in Fig. 5.11. Fix x0 ∈R, and set
y0 := f(x0),
y′
0 := f ′(x0).
The tangent line of the curve C at the point (x0, y0) is given by the equation
y = y′
0(x −x0) + y0. Hence
y = y′
0x + y0 −y′
0x0.
This tangent line can be characterized by the two coordinates
ξ := y′
0,
η := y′
0x0 −y0.
Thus, the equation of the tangent line reads as
y −ξx + η = 0,
x ∈R.
The intuitive meaning of the tangent line coordinates (ξ, η) is the following:
• the symbol ξ represents the slope of the tangent line, and
• (0, −η) represents the intersection point of the tangent line and the y-axis.
In the (ξ, η)-space, the family of tangent lines is given by an equation of the form
η = g(ξ).
Let us compute g′(ξ) by a general argument. For the envelope C of the family of
tangent lines y −ξx + g(ξ) = 0, we get the system
−x + g′(ξ) = 0,
y −ξx + g(ξ) = 0,

η := y′
0x0 −y0,

(x0, y0) ∈C.
Replacing (x0, y0, y′
0) by (x, y, y′) ∈R3, we obtain the Legendre transformation
ξ := y′, η := y′x −y, η′ = x for all (x, y, y′) ∈R3.
Properties of the contact form. Consider the contact form
α := dz −ydx
on the manifold R3 := {(x, y, z) : x, y, z ∈R}. Fix the point P = (x0, y0, z0) in R3.
Let
x = x(t), y = y(t), z = z(t),
−1 < t < 1
be a smooth curve C on R3 which passes through the point P at time t = 0. The
tangent vector (i.e., the velocity vector)
v := ( ˙x(0), ˙y(0), ˙z(0))
of the trajectory C at the point P0 is called admissible iﬀαP (v) = 0. Since
dx(v) = ˙x(0),
dy(v) = ˙y(0),
dz(v) = ˙z(0),
this means that
˙z(0) −y0 ˙x(0) = 0.
(5.32)
The set ΠP of all admissible velocity vectors at the point P forms a plane through
the point P which is given by the equation
ΠP : z −z0 −y0(x −x0) = 0
for all
(x, y, z) ∈R3,
by (5.32). The pair (P, ΠP ) is called the contact element at the point P (with
respect to the contact form α). By deﬁnition, a strip is a family of contact elements
(planes) along a curve (Fig. 5.12).
As Cauchy (1789–1857) and Lie (1842–1899) observed, the initial-value problem
for general ﬁrst-order partial equations can be elegantly handled by constructing
the solution with the help of strips (see M. Giaquinta and S. Hildebrandt, Calculus
of Variations, Vol. 2, Chap. 10, Springer, Berlin, 1995). This is one of the essential
sources of contact geometry.
(i) For the derivative of the contact form α, we get13
dα = d(dz) −dy ∧dx = −dy ∧dx = dx ∧dy.
This is the so-called volume form on the (x, y)-plane.
(ii) We have α ∧dα = dz ∧dx ∧dy = dx ∧dy ∧dz. This is the volume form on R3.
13 Note that dx ∧dy = −dy ∧dx and dx ∧dx = 0. Similar relations are obtained by
the cyclic permutation x ⇒y ⇒z ⇒x. Moreover, d(dx) = d(dy) = d(dz) = 0,

5.7.2 Contact Manifolds and Contact Transformations
Contact form. Fix n = 1, 2, . . . Let M be a (2n + 1)-dimensional real manifold.
This is called a contact manifold iﬀthere exists a smooth diﬀerential 1-form α on
M with14
α ∧(dα)n ̸=
on M.
The form α is called the contact form.
Contact elements. The tangent vector v at the point P of M is called ad-
missible iﬀ
αP (v) = 0.
The set ΠP of all admissible tangent vectors at the point P forms a linear 2n-
dimensional subspace of the tangent space TP M of M at the point P. The pair
(P, ΠP ) is called the contact element at the point P.
Example. Let n = 1, 2, . . . . The (2n + 1)-dimensional manifold
R2n+1 = {(q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn, z) :
qj, pj, z ∈R, j = 1, . . . , n}
is a contact manifold with respect to the contact form

j=1 dqj ∧dpj, and
α ∧(dα)n = dz ∧dq1 ∧· · · ∧dqn ∧dp1 ∧· · · ∧dpn.
This is called the volume form on R2n+1. The diﬀerential 2-form
ω :=

is called the symplectic form on the 2n-dimensional manifold
R2n = {(q1, . . . , qn, p1, . . . , pn) :
qj, pj ∈R, j = 1, . . . , n}.
Contact transformation. Let M, α and N, β be (2n+1)-dimensional contact
manifolds.
A diﬀeomorphism f : M →N is called a contact transformation iﬀit
sends contact elements to contact elements.
Explicitly, this means the following. The diﬀeomorphism f sends smooth curves
passing through the point P to smooth curves passing through the image point
f(P). Diﬀerentiating the curves with respect to the curve parameter, we get the
linearization f ′(P) which sends tangent vectors at P to tangent vectors at f(P).
The diﬀeomorphism f is a contact transformation iﬀ
αP (v) = 0
implies
βf(P )(f ′(P)v) = 0
for all tangent vectors v at the point P and all points P ∈M.
and
d(adx + bdy + cdz) = da ∧dx + db ∧dy + dc ∧dz.
The theory of diﬀerential forms will be thoroughly studied in Vol. III. As an
introduction to diﬀerential forms, we recommend the two textbooks by V. Zorich,

5.7.3 Applications to Geometrical Optics
Consider the manifold R5
L := {(x, y, y′, p, L) :
x, y, y′, p, L ∈R}. Fixing (x, y) in
R2, we obtain the 3-dimensional submanifold
R3
L(x, y) := {(x, y, y′, p, L) : y′, p, L ∈R},
which is a contact manifold with respect to the contact form
dL −pdy′.
Replacing the coordinate L by the symbol H, we obtain the manifold R5
H and its
submanifold R3
H(x, y), which is a 3-dimensional contact manifold with respect to
the contact form dH −y′dp. We claim that:
The Legendre transformation H = y′p−L is a contact transformation from
R3
L(x, y) onto R3
H(x, y).
Proof. Consider a curve
C : y′ = y′(τ),
p = p(τ),
L = L(τ)
which passes through the point P ∈R3
L(x, y) at time τ = 0. This curve has the
tangent vector v = ( ˙y′(0), ˙p(0), ˙L(0)) at the point P, where the dot denotes the
derivative with respect to the curve parameter τ. The Legendre transformation
sends the point P, the curve C, and the tangent vector v to P∗, C∗and v∗, respec-
tively. Explicitly,
C∗: y′ = y′(τ),
p = p(τ),
H = H(τ) = y′(τ)p(τ) −L(τ).
Hence v∗= ( ˙y′(0), ˙p(0), ˙H(0)) with
˙H(0) = ˙y′(0)p(τ) + y′(0) ˙p(0)) −˙L(0),
by the product rule of calculus. This yields15
(dH −y′(0)dp)(v∗) = −(dL −p(0)dy′)(v).
(5.33)
Thus, (dL −p(0)dy′)(v) = 0 implies (dH −y′(0)dp)(v∗) = 0. This tells us that the
Legendre transformation sends admissible tangent vectors to admissible tangent
vectors. In other words, it sends the contact element at the point P to the contact
element at the image point P∗. Consequently, the Legendre transformation is a
contact transformation.
2
Mnemonic approach. It follows from H = py′ −L that we obtain
dH = dp · y′ + pdy′ −dL.
Hence
dL −pdy′ = −(dH −y′dp).
(5.34)
15 Note that −(dL −p(0)dy′)(v) = −˙L(0) + p(0) ˙y′(0) and
(dH −y′(0)dp)(v∗) = ˙H(0) −y(0) ˙p(0) = −˙L(0) + p(0) ˙y′(0).

5.7 Lie’s Contact Geometry
285
Therefore, dL −pdy′ = 0 implies dH −y′dp = 0, and we are done.
Observe that the mnemonic argument works since Leibniz’s product rule
d(y′p) = dy′ · p + y′dp for diﬀerentials corresponds to the product rule
d(y′(τ)p(τ))
dτ
= dy′(τ)
dτ
· p(τ) + y′(τ)dp(τ)
dτ
for derivatives, which we have used in order to obtain the key relation (5.33) in our
proof above. For practical computations, physicists and mathematicians frequently
use the mnemonic argument. We will do this, too (see Problem 5.1).
Perspective. One can rigorously show that Fermat’s principle of least time is
equivalent to Huygens’ principle for the propagation of wave fronts. To this end,
one has to use one-parameter families of contact transformations in an appropriate
higher-dimensional space. This can be found in Giaquinta and Hildebrandt (1995),
Vol. 2, Sect. 3.4. In a general setting, we will study this in Vol. III by considering
the Cartan–K¨ahler theorem for systems of diﬀerential forms and its applications to
the following topics:
• diﬀerential geometry (e.g., the main theorem on the construction of surfaces by
means of the Gaussian invariants and its generalization to higher dimensions),
• the theory of Lie groups (the reconstruction of a Lie group from its Lie algebra),
• geometrical optics, and
• thermodynamics.
5.7.4 Equilibrium Thermodynamics and Legendre Submanifolds
Thermodynamical systems in equilibrium states (e.g., chemical substances)
can be described by the Gibbs contact form and its integral manifolds.
Folklore
Every mathematician knows that it is impossible to understand any ele-
mentary course in thermodynamics. The reason is that thermodynamics
is based – as Gibbs (1839–1903) has explicitly proclaimed – on the rather
complicated mathematical theory of contact geometry.16
Vladimir Arnold, 1990
Consider a chemical substance in thermodynamical equilibrium. The physics of this
substance is governed by the Gibbs contact form
Γ := dE −TdS + PdV −μdN.
(5.35)
Here, the symbols have the following physical meaning:
• T (absolute temperature),
• V (volume), P (pressure), N (particle number),
• E (inner energy), S (entropy), μ (chemical potential).
Physicists also introduce the following quantities:
• F := E −TS (free energy),
• Ω := E −TS −μN (statistical potential or Gibbs potential),
• H := E + PV (enthalpy),

5. Geometrical Optics
• G = F + PV (free enthalpy).
In physics, one has frequently to change the independent thermodynamical vari-
ables.
The following approach based on the Gibbs contact form is very ﬂexible
with respect to changing variables.
The fundamental Gibbs equation. The 7-dimensional real manifold
R7
Gibbs := {(E, T, S, P, V, μ, N) ∈R7}
is called the Gibbs manifold. This is a contact manifold with respect to the Gibbs
contact form (5.35). A submanifold M of the Gibbs manifold R7
Gibbs is called an
integral manifold of the Gibbs contact form Γ iﬀthe fundamental Gibbs equation
Γ = 0
on M
(5.36)
is satisﬁed. This means that
ΓP(v) = 0
(5.37)
for all tangent vectors v at the point P and all points P in M. The maximal
dimension of an integral manifold for Γ is equal to three. Integral manifolds of
maximal dimension are called Legendre submanifolds.
Thermodynamical processes. Let us ﬁrst consider one-dimensional integral
manifolds of the Gibbs contact form Γ. Consider the smooth curve
C :
t →(E(t), T(t), S(t), P(t), V (t), μ(t), N(t))
(5.38)
on the open time interval U. By deﬁnition, the curve C describes a thermodynamical
process iﬀit is an one-dimensional integral manifold of Γ. The velocity vector looks
like
v(t) = ( ˙E(t), ˙T(t), ˙S(t), ˙P(t), ˙V (t), ˙μ(t), ˙N(t)).
In order to get a submanifold C of the Gibbs manifold, we have to assume that
v(t) ̸= 0 for all t ∈U. Note that dE is a linear functional at each point of the Gibbs
manifold with dE(v(t)) = ˙E(t), as well as dS(v(t)) = ˙S(t) and so on. The curve C
satisﬁes equation (5.37) iﬀ
˙E(t) −T(t) ˙S(t) + P(t) ˙V (t) −μ(t) ˙N(t) = 0,
t ∈U.
(5.39)
Suppose that we are given the smooth energy function
E = E(S, V, N)
for all
(S, V, N) ∈V,
where V is a nonempty open subset of R3. Choose E(t) := E(S(t), V (t), N(t)). Fix
the point P and suppose that the curve C passes through the point P at the ﬁxed
time t. By the chain rule, it follows from (5.39) that
ES(P) ˙S(t) + EV (P) ˙V (t) + EN(P) ˙N(t) = T(t) ˙S(t) −P(t) ˙V (t) + μ(t) ˙N(t).
Since the curve C can be chosen in such a way that the derivatives ˙E(t), ˙S(t) and
˙N(t) attain arbitrary values, comparison of coeﬃcients gives
T = ES(P), P = −EV (P), μ = EN(P),
P ∈V.
(5.40)

5.7 Lie’s Contact Geometry
287
In terms of physics, this equation tells us the crucial fact that the energy function
E = E(S, V, N) allows us to compute all the remaining physical quantities T, P, μ
by merely using diﬀerentiation. This motivates why the function E = E(S, V, N) is
called a thermodynamical potential by physicists.
Reversibility and heat production. A process realized in nature is called
reversible iﬀthe process obtained by time reﬂection can also be realized in nature.
Otherwise the process is called irreversible. Biological processes are irreversible. For
example, the life process of a human being cannot be reversed in time. Applying
time reﬂection t →−t to the process C from (5.38), we get
C−:
t →(E(−t), T(−t), S(−t), P(−t), V (−t), μ(−t), N(−t)).
If the process equation (5.39) is satisﬁed for C, then it is also satisﬁed for C−. Thus,
the process C is reversible. The process C is called quasi-stationary. In terms of
physics, this means that the process runs very slowly in such a way that, approxi-
mately, the chemical substance is in a thermodynamical equilibrium state at each
point in time. This represents an idealization of real thermodynamical processes.
For quasi-stationary processes, the integral
Q([t0, t1]) =
Z t1
t0
T(t) ˙S(t) dt
is the amount of heat energy produced by the process during the time interval
[t0, t1]. More general thermodynamical processes including irreversible processes
will be discussed in Sect. 7.17.9 in the setting of the second law in thermodynamics.
It turns out that entropy measures the complexity and the stored information of
many-particle systems in nature.
Coordinate transformation on the Gibbs manifold and the statistical
potential Ω. By setting
Ω := E −ST −μN
with the inverse transformation E = Ω +ST +μT, let us introduce the new coordi-
nates (Ω, T, S, P, V, μ, N) on the Gibbs manifold R7
Gibbs. The process (5.38) yields
Ω(t) = E(t) −S(t)T(t) −μ(t)N(t). Diﬀerentiating this with respect to time t, the
product rule tells us that
˙E(t) = ˙Ω(t) + ˙S(t)T(t) + S(t) ˙T(t) + ˙μ(t)N(t) + μ(t) ˙N(t).
From the process equation (5.39), we obtain
˙Ω(t) = −S(t) ˙T(t) −P(t) ˙V (t) −N(t) ˙μ(t),
t ∈U.
(5.41)
Suppose that we are given the smooth function
Ω = Ω(T, V, μ),
(T, V, μ) ∈W
where W is a nonempty open subset of R3. As above, equation (5.41) implies
S = −ΩT , P = −ΩV , N = −Ωμ.
(5.42)
In addition, E = Ω −ST −μN. The statistical potential Ω introduced by Gibbs
is crucial in thermodynamics. We will show in Sect. 7.17.3 on page 638 that the
statistical potential Ω can be constructed by means of the method of statistical
physics. Then the other thermodynamical quantities can be obtained from (5.42).
Mnemonic approach. Dividing the equation Γ = 0, that is,

dE = TdS −PdV + μdN
(5.43)
by the symbol dt, we get the process equation
dE
dt = T dS
dt −P dV
dt + μdN
dt .
This is (5.39). Let E = E(S, V, N). From (5.43), we get
ESdS + EV dV + ENdN = TdS −PdV + μdN.
Comparing the coeﬃcients of dS, dV, dN, we obtain
ES = T, EV = −P, EN = μ.
Passing to Ω = E −ST −μN, we get dΩ = dE −dS · T −SdT −dμ · N + μdN.
Using (5.43),
dΩ = −SdT −PdV −Ndμ.
If Ω = Ω(T, V, μ), then
ΩT dT + ΩV dV + Ωμdμ = −SdT −PdV −Ndμ.
Hence ΩT = −S, ΩV = −P, Ωμ = −N. The rigorous justiﬁcation of this mnemonic
approach can be based on Problem 5.1.
Thermodynamical potentials. Now we want to study Legendre submanifolds
of the Gibbs contact form Γ. Such submanifolds describe the physics of chemical
substances in terms of thermodynamical potentials.
(i) Basic variables S, V, N (inner energy E as thermodynamical potential): Set
P := (S, V, N). Let
P →(E, T, S, P, V, μ, N)
(5.44)
be a smooth immersion from the nonempty open subset V of R3 into the Gibbs
manifold R7
Gibbs such that
T = ES, P = −EV , μ = EN
on V.
Then the image of this map is a Legendre submanifold of the Gibbs contact
form Γ. The immersion property guarantees that the image of the map (5.44)
is a 3-dimensional submanifold of the Gibbs manifold.17
17 The smooth map (x, y) →(u(x, y), v(x, y), w(x, y)) from an open subset U of R2
into R3 is an immersion iﬀthe linearization of this map is injective at each point
P = (x0, y0). That is, the matrix of the ﬁrst-order partial derivatives
 
ux(P) vx(P), wx(P)
uy(P) vy(P) wy(P)
!
(5.45)
has maximal rank for all P ∈U (i.e., rank = 2 in the present case).

In humbleness we have to admit that if “number” is a product of our
imagination, “space” has a reality outside of our imagination, to which we
a priori cannot assign its laws.

5. Geometrical Optics
An axiomatic approach to Euclidean geometry was formulated by the Greek math-
ematician Euclid (about 360 B.C.–290 B.C.) in his famous Elements. More than
2000 years later, three mathematicians proved independently that there exist log-
ically consistent non-Euclidean geometries for which Euclid’s parallel axiom does
not hold, namely, Gauss (1777–1855) in 1792ﬀ, Lobachevsky (1792–1856) in 1826ﬀ,
and B´olayi, Jr. (1802–1860) in 1832.19 Morris Kline writes in his history of mathe-
matics:20
Gauss said in a letter to Bessel of January 27, 1829, that he probably would
never publish his ﬁndings in non-Euclidean geometry, because he feared
ridicule, or, as he put it, the clamor of Boeotians, a ﬁgurative reference to
a dull-witted Greek tribe.
The reader should notice that in Gauss’ time the intellectual world at large was
dominated by the preeminent German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1742–1804)
who claimed in his 1781 major work Critique of Pure Reason that Euclidean geom-
etry is ﬁxed a priori in all the human brains. Gauss did not share Kant’s opinion.
The development of Einstein’s theory of general relativity proved that Gauss was
right.
Models of non-Euclidean geometry (based on subsets of the Euclidean plane

1868, Klein (1842–1925) in 1871, and Poincar´e (1854–1912) in 1902. The Poincar´e
model was very inﬂuential because of his close relation to elementary geometric
and physical intuition.21 We will study this model and its relations to modern
mathematics and physics in Sect. 5.10. The modern axiomatic approach to geometry
was published by Hilbert in his 1899 monograph.22

5.8.1 Linear Symplectic Spaces
Symplectic forms. Let Y be a real linear space. By a symplectic form κ on Y , we
understand a bilinear map κ : Y × Y →R which has the following two properties:
• κ(v, w) = −κ(w, v) for all v, w ∈Y (antisymmetry).
• If κ(v0, w) = 0 for all w ∈Y and ﬁxed v0 ∈Y , then v0 = 0 (non-degeneracy).
The real linear space Y equipped with a symplectic form κ is called a symplectic
space.
Symplectic morphism. Let Y, Z be real, symplectic spaces with the symplec-
tic forms κ, σ, respectively. By deﬁnition, a symplectic morphism is a linear map
A : Y →Z with
σ(Av, Aw) = κ(v, w)
for all
v, w ∈Y.
If, in addition, this map A is bijective, then it is called a symplectic isomorphism.
Almost complex space. The space Y is called almost complex iﬀit is a real
linear space and there exists a linear operator J : Y →Y with J2 = −I. Here, I
denotes the unit operator.
Example 1 (the space CR). Let z = x+iy and ζ = ξ +iη be complex numbers,
that is, x, y, ξ, η ∈R. The set C of all complex numbers is a one-dimensional complex
Hilbert space equipped with the inner product
⟨z|ζ⟩:= z†ζ.
Explicitly,
⟨z|ζ⟩= (x −iy)(ξ + iη) = (xξ + yη) + i(xη −yξ).
(5.46)
Let z ∈C. Restricting the multiplication αz to real numbers α, the set C becomes
a linear space denoted by CR.
• CR is a real 2-dimensional linear space. Setting
⟨z|ζ⟩R := ℜ(⟨z|ζ⟩) and κ(z, ζ) := ℑ(⟨z|ζ⟩)
for all
z, ζ ∈CR,
we get the key decomposition
⟨z|ζ⟩= ⟨z|ζ⟩R + iκ(z, ζ)
for all
z, ζ ∈CR.
Explicitly, ⟨z|ζ⟩R = xξ + yη and κ(z, ζ) = xη −yξ. The following are met:
• CR is a real 2-dimensional Hilbert space equipped with the inner product ⟨z|ζ⟩R.
The elements 1 and i form an orthonormal basis of CR. The real space CR is
called the realiﬁcation of the complex space C.
• CR is a symplectic space equipped with the symplectic form κ. The two complex
numbers z = x + iy and ζ = ξ + iζ span a parallelogram whose area is equal to
κ(z, ζ) (Fig. 5.13).
• CR is an almost complex space equipped with the operator Jz := iz for all z ∈CR.
For all z, ζ ∈CR, the following hold:
• ⟨Jz|Jζ⟩R = ⟨z|ζ⟩R (i.e., J is unitary on CR).
• κ(z, ζ) = ⟨Jz|ζ⟩R and κ(Jz, Jζ) = κ(z, ζ) (J is symplectic on CR).

This follows from the fact that ⟨.|.⟩is an inner product on C. For example,
⟨Jz|Jζ⟩R = ℜ(⟨iz|iζ⟩) = ℜ(−i2⟨z|ζ⟩) = ℜ(⟨z|ζ⟩) = ⟨z|ζ⟩R.
Furthermore, κ(Jz, Jζ) = ℑ(⟨Jz|Jζ⟩) = ℑ(⟨z|ζ⟩) = κ(z, ζ).
Example 2 (the space R2). For real numbers x, y, ξ, η, set
v :=
 
x
y
!
,
w :=
 
ξ
η
!
,
J :=
 
0 1

.
Note that J 2 = −I. The space R2 consists of all matrices of the form v, w above.
Deﬁne ⟨v|w⟩R := vdw and σ(v, w) := vdJ w. Explicitly, we obtain ⟨v|w⟩R = xξ + yη
and
σ(v, w) = det(v, w) =
˛˛˛˛˛
x ξ
y η
˛˛˛˛˛ = xη −yξ.
The following hold:
• R2 is a real 2-dimensional linear space.
• R2 is a real Hilbert space equipped with the inner product ⟨.|.⟩R.
• R2 is a symplectic space equipped with the symplectic form σ.
• R2 is an almost complex space equipped with the operator J .
The two examples above are intimately related to each other. In fact, the map
x + iy →(x, y)
yields a linear isomorphism from the real space CR onto the real space R2. This
map preserves both the Hilbert space structure and the symplectic structure (i.e.,
the map is unitary, and it is a symplectic isomorphism).
Matrix groups. The set of all real (2 × 2)-matrices
A =
 
α β
γ δ

α, β, γ, δ ∈R
with det A ̸= 0 (i.e., αδ −βγ ̸= 0) forms a group with respect to matrix multipli-
cation. More precisely, this is a real 4-dimensional Lie group denoted by GL(2, R)
(general real linear group). The subgroup of GL(2, R) which consists of all real
(2 × 2)-matrices A with det A = 1 (i.e., αδ −βγ = 1) forms a real 3-dimensional
Lie group which is denoted by SL(2, R) (special real linear group).

Proposition 5.6 For a linear operator A : R2 →R2, the following statements are
equivalent:
(i) A is a symplectic isomorphism.
(ii) AdJ A = J .
(iii) A ∈SL(2, R) (i.e., det A = 1).
Proof. (i) ⇔(ii): Use σ(Av, Aw) = (Av)dJ Aw = vd(AdJ A)w together with
σ(v, w) = vdJ w.
(ii)⇔(iii): Explicitly, AdJ A = J means that

Symplectic geometry. The set of symplectic isomorphisms forms the group
SL(2, R) which is called the symplectic group. This is a Lie group. Precisely the
invariants of SL(2, R) are properties of the symplectic geometry on R2. The most
important symplectic invariant is the area
σ(v, w) = det(v, w) =
˛˛˛˛˛
x ξ
y η
˛˛˛˛˛
spanned by the vectors v and w. In fact, if A ∈SL(2, R), then σ(Av, Aw) is equal
to σ(v, w). That is, det(Av, Aw) = det(v, w) for all A ∈SL(2, R). The symplectic
group SL(2, R) and its fundamental applications are studied in the monograph by
S. Lang, SL(2, R), Addison–Wesley, Reading, Massachusetts, 1975. In a straight-
forward way, the preceding examples can be generalized to complex Hilbert spaces,
as we will show in the next section.
The Lie algebra sl(2, R). The relation between Lie groups and Lie algebras
will be thoroughly studied in Vol. III. We will show that:
The theory of Lie groups and their Lie algebras represents a far-reaching
generalization of the exponential function and the logarithmic function.
At this point, we only make the following remark with a view to hyperbolic non-
Euclidean geometry below. The set of all real (2 × 2)-matrices
A =
 
α β
γ δ
!
,
α, β, γ, δ ∈R
(5.47)
with tr(A) = 0 (i.e., α + δ = 0) forms a real 3-dimensional Lie algebra with respect
to the Lie product [A, B] := AB −BA. This Lie algebra is denoted by sl(2, R).
Setting
B := eA,
A ∈sl(2, R),
we get a map A →B from the Lie algebra sl(2, R) into the Lie group SL(2, R).
This so-called exponential map is a diﬀeomorphism from a suﬃciently small open
neighborhood of the origin A = 0 in sl(2, R) onto a suﬃciently small open neigh-
borhood of the unit element I in SL(2, R). Observe that the inverse map A = ln B
yields a parametrization of the real 3-dimensional manifold SL(2, R) near the unit
element I. The Lie algebra sl(2, R) represents the parameter space.
On page 317, we will introduce the symmetry group Sym(HC) of the hyperbolic
geometry on the hyperbolic plane. There exists a group epimorphism

294
5. Geometrical Optics
ϱ : SL(2, R) →Sym(HR)
with the kernel N = {I, −I}. Thus, we obtain the group isomorphism
Sym(HR) ≃SL(2, R)/N.
(5.48)
In a suﬃciently small neighborhood of the unit element I, the groups Sym(HR)
and SL(2, R) are locally isomorphic. Hence the Lie algebra of Sym(HR) is equal to
the Lie algebra of SL(2, R). Thus, Sym(HR) has the Lie algebra sl(2, R). This fact
will critically be used in Sect. 5.11 in order to display Ariadne’s thread to gauge
theory in terms of hyperbolic light-ray geometry.
The Lie group SL(2, C) and Einstein’s theory of special relativity. The
symbol SL(2, C) denotes the set of all complex (2 × 2)-matrices
A =
 
α β
γ δ

α, β, γ, δ ∈C
with det A = 1, that is, αδ −βγ = 1. For complex (2 × 2)-matrices, we have
A ∈SL(2, C)
iﬀ
AdJ A = J .
Therefore, the group SL(2, C) is the symmetry group of the symplectic geometry
on the complex linear space C2.
The group SL(2, C) plays the key role in special relativity.
More precisely, the change of inertial systems under preservation of the orientation
of both space and time is described by the proper Lorentz group SO+(3, 1). The
simply connected, real, 6-dimensional Lie group SL(2, C) is the universal covering
group of SO+(3, 1). Explicitly, we have the Lie group isomorphism
SO+(3, 1) ≃SL(2, C)/N
(5.49)
with the normal subgroup N := {I, −I} of SL(2, C). From the mathematical point
of view, the Lie group epimorphism
χ : SL(2, C) →SO+(3, 1)
with the kernel N is responsible for the appearance of the electron spin (intrinsic
angular momentum of the electron) in special relativity. We will thoroughly study
this in Vol. III. As an introduction, we recommend the classics by B. van der
Waerden, Group Theory and Quantum Mechanics, Springer, New York, 1974.
Comparing the group isomorphisms (5.48) and (5.49) with each other, one
discovers that Einstein’s theory of special relativity represents a quite nat-
ural generalization of non-Euclidean hyperbolic geometry, in terms of the
Lie groups SL(2, R) and SL(2, C).
The group SU(n). Let n = 1, 2, . . . Recall the following terminology.
• U(n): A complex (n × n)-matrix A is called unitary iﬀAA† = A†A = I. These
matrices form the group U(n) which is a real n2-dimensional Lie group.
• U(1): In particular, the real 1-dimensional Lie group U(1) consists of all complex
numbers z with |z| = 1.
• SU(n): The matrices A in U(n) with det A = 1 form a real Lie group of dimension
n2 −1. In particular, SU(2) is a subgroup of SL(2, C).

5.8 Light Rays and Non-Euclidean Geometry
295
It is quite remarkable that the low-dimensional Lie groups
U(1), SU(2), SU(3), SL(2, C)
play a fundamental role in describing elementary particles in the setting of
the Standard Model.23
In contrast to this, the symmetry group for describing gravitation in the setting of
Einstein’s theory of general relativity is the complicated inﬁnite-dimensional diﬀeo-
morphism group of the real 4-dimensional space-time manifold, which is a pseudo-
Riemannian manifold. In the search for a uniﬁed theory for the four fundamental
forces in nature, one has to combine the ﬁnite-dimensional Lie groups describing
elementary particles with inﬁnite-dimensional groups related to gravitation. This
is an open problem.
5.8.2 The K¨ahler Form of a Complex Hilbert Space
The splitting of the inner product of a complex Hilbert space into real
part and complex part corresponds to a splitting of the unitary geometry
in Hilbert spaces into symplectic geometry and K¨ahler geometry. These
geometries are fundamental for both classical and modern physics.
Folklore
This section serves as a preparation for the theory of K¨ahler mannifolds to be
considered in the next section in the framework of non-Euclidean geometry.
From the complex Hilbert space X to the real Hilbert space XR. Let
X be a complex Hilbert space with the inner product ⟨.|.⟩. For all v, w ∈X, deﬁne
⟨v|w⟩R := ℜ(⟨v|w⟩),
κ(v, w) := ℑ(⟨v|w⟩).
Here, κ : X × X →R is called the K¨ahler form of the complex Hilbert space X.
Alternatively, observing that ⟨v|w⟩† = ⟨w|v⟩, we get
⟨v|w⟩R = 1

for all v, w ∈X. The following hold: Let v, w ∈X. Considering only real linear
combinations αv +βw with α, β ∈R, the set X becomes a real linear space denoted
by XR. Then:
• XR is a real Hilbert space equipped with the inner product ⟨.|.⟩R. The real Hilbert
space XR is called the realiﬁcation of the original complex Hilbert space X.
• XR is a symplectic space equipped with the symplectic form κ.
Proof. Note that ⟨v|v⟩is real for all v ∈X. Therefore, ⟨v|v⟩R = 0 implies ⟨v|v⟩= 0.
Hence v = 0. Furthermore, it follows from ⟨w|v⟩† = ⟨v|w⟩that
κ(v, w) = ℑ(⟨v|w⟩) = −ℑ(⟨w|v⟩) = −κ(w, v).
Finally, suppose that κ(v0, v) = 0 for all v ∈XR. Choose v := iv0. Then
ℑ(⟨v0|iv0⟩) = 0. Thus, ℑ(i⟨v0|v0⟩) = 0. This implies ⟨v0|v0⟩R = 0, and hence v0 = 0.

Deﬁne the operator Jv := iv for all v ∈X. Then, J2 = −I. For all v, w ∈XR,
we get:

tiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences, Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 13

• ⟨Jv|Jw⟩R = ⟨v|w⟩R and
• ⟨Jv|w⟩R = −⟨v|Jw⟩R.
Thus, the operator J : XR →XR is unitary and skew-adjoint. In fact,
⟨Jv|Jw⟩R = ⟨iv|iw⟩R = ℜ(−i2⟨v|w⟩) = ⟨v|w⟩R.
Moreover, ⟨Jv|w⟩R = ℜ(−i⟨v|w⟩) = −ℜ(⟨v|iw⟩) = −⟨v|Jw⟩R. This tells us that
J† = −J.
From the real Hilbert space Y to the complex Hilbert space YC. Let Y
be a real Hilbert space with the inner product ⟨.|.⟩R, and let Y be almost complex,
that is, there exists a linear operator J : Y →Y with
J 2 = −I.
Let v ∈Y. Deﬁne the complex multiplication
(α + βi)v := αv + βJ v
for all
α, β ∈R.
This way, the space Y becomes a complex linear space denoted by YC. One checks
this by direct computation. For example,
i(iv) = J (J v) = J 2v = −v
for all
v ∈Y.
Similarly, one gets a(bv) = (ab)v for all a, b ∈C. The complex space YC is called a
complexiﬁcation of the real space Y.
Proposition 5.7 Let J : Y →Y be a unitary operator on the real Hilbert space
Y with J 2 = −I. Then:
(i) The real linear space Y becomes a symplectic space equipped with the sym-
plectic form κ(v, w) := ⟨J v|w⟩R for all v, w ∈Y.
(ii) The complex linear space YC becomes a complex Hilbert space equipped with
the inner product ⟨v|w⟩:= ⟨v|w⟩R + iκ(v, w) for all v, w ∈Y.
Proof. Ad (i). Since J is unitary, it follows from J −1 = J † and J 2 = −I that
J † = −J . Hence
κ(v, w) = ⟨J v|w⟩R = −⟨v|J w⟩R = −κ(w, v).
Suppose that κ(v0, w) = 0 for all w ∈Y . Choose w := J v0. Then we obtain
κ(v0, J v0) = ⟨J v0|J v0⟩R = ⟨v0|v0⟩R = 0.
Hence v0 = 0.
Ad (ii). ⟨w|v⟩= ⟨w|v⟩R + iκ(w, v) = ⟨v|w⟩R −iκ(v, w) = ⟨v|w⟩†. Furthermore,
let us show that ⟨v|iw⟩= i⟨v|w⟩. In fact, ⟨v|iw⟩= ⟨v|J w⟩. This is equal to
⟨v|J w⟩R + iκ(v, J w) = κ(w, v) + i⟨v|w⟩R = i(⟨v|w⟩R + iκ(v, w)) = i⟨v|w⟩.
Finally, ⟨v|v⟩= ⟨v|v⟩R. Therefore, ⟨v|v⟩> 0 if v ̸= 0.

5.8.3 The Refraction Index and Geodesics
The Poincar´e model in non–Euclidean geometry is obtained by replacing straight
lines in Euclidean geometry by light rays in the upper half-plane equipped with an
appropriate refraction index.
• The light rays are called hyperbolic straight lines.
• The angles between the light rays are called hyperbolic angles.
In contrast to Euclidean geometry, the sum of angles of a hyperbolic triangle is not
equal to π, but less than π. The Poincar´e model represents an extremely elegant
formulation of Lobachevsky’s sophisticated work on non-Euclidean geometry. For-
mulated in the right mathematical language due to ´Elie Cartan (i.e., based on both
the connection form and the curvature form), the Poincar´e model is the prototype
of both the Einstein theory of general relativity on gravitation and the Standard
Model in elementary particle physics. In the following sections, we want to study
the Poincar´e model and its relations to numerous important subjects in modern
mathematics and physics. In greater detail, we will investigate this in Vol. III on
gauge theory.24
Regard the open upper half-plane HR := {(x, y) ∈R2 : y > 0} as an optical
medium with the refraction index n(x, y) at the point (x, y). We assume that the
function (x, y) →n(x, y) is smooth and that n(x, y) > 0 for all (x, y) ∈R. We also
deﬁne
HC := {z ∈C : ℑ(z) > 0}.
The map (x, y) →x + iy is a natural bijection from HR onto HC. We will use the
following notation:
• C : x = x(τ), y = y(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1 (smooth curve),
• Q(τ) := (x(τ), y(τ), ˙x(τ), ˙y(τ)),
• L(x, y, ˙x, ˙y) := n(x, y)2( ˙x2 + ˙y2) (energetic Lagrangian),
• L(x, y, ˙x, ˙y) :=
p
L(x, y, ˙x, ˙y) (metric Lagrangian),
• l(C) :=
R τ1
τ0 L(Q(τ)) dτ
(length of the curve C),
• E(C) :=
R τ1
τ0 L(Q(τ)) dτ
(geodesic energy of the curve C).
Here, [τ0, τ1] is a compact parameter interval.
Fermat’s principle of minimal arc length. The integral
T(C) :=
Z τ1
τ0
n(x(τ), y(τ))
c

˙x(τ)2 + ˙y(τ)2 dτ
is equal to the time needed by a light ray to pass from the point (x(τ0), y(τ0)) to
the point (x(τ1), y(τ1)) along the curve C. We deﬁne l(C) := c · T(C). Then, l(C)
has the physical dimension of length, and we call l(C) the arc length of the curve
C (with respect to the refraction index n = n(x, y)). In particular, the arc length
between the points (x(τ0), y(τ0)) and (x(τ), y(τ)) is given by
24 Fermat (1601–1665), Huygens (1629–1695), Euler (1707–1783), Lagrange (1736–
1813), Gauss (1777–1855), Lobachevsky (1792–1856), Riemann (1826–1866), Bel-
trami (1835–1900), Lie (1842–1899), Klein (1849–1925), Poincar´e (1854–1912),

This diﬀers from the Euclidean expression ds2 = dx2 + dy2 by the conformal factor
n(x, y)2.
The Euler–Lagrange equations. Suppose that we are given the two points
(x0, y0) and (x1, y1) on the upper half-plane HR. Fermat’s problem of least arc
length reads as
l(C) = min!,
(x(τk), y(τk)) = (xk, yk), k = 0, 1.
(5.50)
Using the notation introduced above, this means:
Z τ1
τ0
L(Q(τ)) dτ = min!,
(x(τk), y(τk)) = (xk, yk), k = 0, 1.

Here, the initial point (x0, y0) and the ﬁnal point (x1, y1) are ﬁxed. The smooth
solutions of (5.51) satisfy the following Euler–Lagrange equations:
d
dτ L ˙x(Q(τ)) = Lx(Q(τ)),

The failure of the Legendre transformation for the metric Lagrangian.
We set
p := L ˙x,
q := L ˙y,
H := ˙xp + ˙yq −L.
Obviously,
L ˙x ˙x + L ˙y ˙y = 2L.
(5.53)
This yields
H = L ˙x ˙x + L ˙y ˙y −2L

≡0.
Thus, the Legendre transformation does not work. The reason for this degeneracy
is the homogeneity of the Lagrangian (with respect to ˙x and ˙y) which leads to the
Euler identity (5.53). This homogeneity of the Lagrangian allows us the rescaling
of the curve parameter without changing the integral
R τ1
τ0 Ldτ.
One possibility to overcome the trouble is to ﬁx the parameter τ := x. This was
successfully done in Sect. 5.5. Now we want to use a general geometric method by
choosing the curve parameter τ as arc length.

5.8.4 The Trick of Gauge Fixing
Many variational problems in mathematics and physics possess additional
degrees of freedom called gauge degrees of freedom (e.g., the choice of
parametrization or the choice of potentials). This concerns problems in
geometry (e.g., geodesics and minimal surfaces), in quantum electrody-
namics in terms of the 4-potential, in the Standard Model of elementary
particle physics, and in string theory based on the conformal invariance of
the action functional.25 The strategy for handling such problems is to ﬁx
a special gauge. However, the introduction of additional constraints has to
be done with care. Moreover, one has to ensure that physical statements do
not depend on the choice of the gauge ﬁxing. In quantum ﬁeld theory this
is closely related to the Ward identities, the more general Slavnov–Taylor
identities, and the cohomological BRST-symmetry theory due to Becchi,
Rouet, Stora and Tyutin.

L(Q(τ)) ≡1.
Consequently, the curve parameter τ equals arc length. Thus, we obtain the follow-
ing equivalence of equations.
Proposition 5.8 Each smooth solution of (5.54), (5.55) is a solution of the Euler–
Lagrange equations (5.52) parameterized by arc length.
Conversely, each solution of the Euler–Lagrange equations (5.52) parameterized
by arc length is a solution of (5.54), (5.55).
The basic trick is that the equation (5.54) has the function L as conserved quan-
tity, as we will show below via Legendre transformation. This means that for each
solution of (5.54) with the initial condition L(Q(τ0)) = 1, we get Q(τ) ≡1. That
is, the constraint equation (5.55) is automatically satisﬁed.
5.8.5 Geodesic Flow
First let us investigate the so-called geodesic ﬂow equations:
d
dτ L ˙x(Q(τ)) = Lx(Q(τ)),
d
dτ L ˙y(Q(τ)) = Ly(Q(τ)).
(5.56)
The precise relation to Fermat’s minimum principle will be studied below. This will
motivate the following basic deﬁnition.
Geodesics. The solutions x = x(τ), y = y(τ) of (5.56) in the open upper half-
plane HR with the real curve parameter τ are called geodesics with respect to the
metric ds2 = n(x, y)2(dx2 + dy2).
25 This will be studied in Vol. III.

300
5. Geometrical Optics
Intuitively, geodesics are light rays in the optical medium HR with the re-
fraction index n(x, y) at the point (x, y).
Explicitly, the equation (5.56) for geodesics reads as26
¨x + nx
n
˙x2 + 2ny

˙x ˙y −nx
n
˙y2 = 0,
¨y −ny
n
˙x2 + 2nx
n
˙x ˙y + ny
n
˙y2 = 0.
(5.57)
This is a second-order system of ordinary diﬀerential equations for the geodesics.
We will show in Vol. III that Einstein’s equation of motion for light rays (and
celestial bodies) has the same structure. Setting z(τ) = x(τ) + iy(τ) and noting
that ∂zn := 1
2(nx −iny), the equation for the geodesics can elegantly be written as
˙w = −2∂zn(z)
n(z)
˙z2,
˙w = z.
(5.58)
This is the equation for a dynamical system called the geodesic ﬂow. Explicitly, one
has to replace ˙z and n(z) by ˙z(τ) and n(z(τ)), respectively, and so on.
5.8.6 Hamilton’s Duality Trick and Cogeodesic Flow
Mathematicians and physicists enjoy Hamiltonian systems, since such dy-
namical systems allow the application of methods from symplectic geom-
etry. In particular, the Hamiltonian function of a Hamiltonian system is
always a conserved quantity.
Folklore
The cogeodesic ﬂow equations read as follows:
˙p = −Hx,
˙q = −Hy,
˙x = Hp,
˙y = Hq.
(5.59)
Here, we use the Hamiltonian function
H(x, y, p, q) :=
p2
4n(x, y)2 +
q2
4n(x, y)2 ,
which is dual to the energetic Lagrangian L(x, y, ˙x, ˙y) = n(x, y)2( ˙x + ˙y2). We are
looking for smooth trajectories τ →(x(τ), y(τ), p(τ), q(τ)) which satisfy equation
(5.59). Setting z = x + iy and u = p + iq, the cogeodesic ﬂow equation can be
written as
˙u = −∂¯zH,
˙z = ∂¯uH.
(5.60)
26 Note that L = n2( ˙x2 + ˙y2), and hence L ˙x = 2n2 ˙x, Lx = 2nnx( ˙x2 + ˙y2). This
implies
d
dτ L ˙x = (4nnx ˙x + 4nny ˙y) ˙x + 2n2¨x.

5.8 Light Rays and Non-Euclidean Geometry
301
Theorem 5.9 (i) The geodesic ﬂow equation (5.56) is equivalent to the cogeodesic
ﬂow equation (5.59) via Legendre transformation with respect to the energetic La-
grangian L.
(ii) The solutions of (5.59) are constant along the Hamiltonian function H (i.e.,
H is a conserved quantity).
(iii) The energetic Lagrangian L is a conserved quantity of the geodesic ﬂow
equation (5.56).
(iv) Each solution of the geodesic ﬂow equation (5.56) which satisﬁes the ini-
tial condition L(Q(τ0)) = 1 is a solution of the Euler–Lagrange equations (5.52)
parameterized by arc length.
Proof. Ad (i). The Legendre transformation with respect to the energetic La-
grangian L is given by
p := L ˙x, q := L ˙y, H = p ˙x + ˙yq −L.
This way, the Euler–Lagrange equations (5.56) with respect to L pass over to the
Hamiltonian canonical equations (5.59) with respect to H. Explicitly,
p = 2n(x, y)2 ˙x,
q = 2n(x, y)2 ˙y,
H = n(x, y)2( ˙x2 + ˙y2).
Ad (ii). For a solution of (5.59), we get
d
dτ H(x(τ), y(τ), p(τ), q(τ)) = Hx ˙x + Hy ˙y + Hp ˙p + Hq ˙q
= −˙p ˙x −˙q ˙y + ˙x ˙p + ˙y ˙q ≡0.
Ad (iii). This follows from (ii) by Legendre transformation.
Ad (iv). By (iii), the solutions of (5.59) satisfy (5.54), (5.55), and hence they
satisfy (5.52).

5.8.7 The Principle of Minimal Geodesic Energy
Parallel to the Fermat problem (5.51) of least arc length, we formulate the problem
of least geodesic energy:
Z τ
τ0
L(Q(τ)) = min!,
(x(τk), y(τk)) = (xk, yk), k = 0, 1.
(5.61)
Here, the initial point (x0, y0) and the ﬁnal point (x1, y1) are ﬁxed. Observe that
the metric Lagrangian L =
√
L has been replaced by the energetic Lagrangian L.
There holds the following equivalence principle.
Theorem 5.10 (i) The smooth solutions of the energetic minimum problem (5.61)
satisfy the geodesic ﬂow equations (5.56).
(ii) Each smooth solution of the energetic minimum problem (5.61) is also a
solution of the Fermat minimum problem (5.51).
(iii) Conversely, each solution of the Fermat minimum problem (5.51) parame-
terized by arc length is a solution of the energetic minimum problem (5.61).

5.9 Spherical Geometry
Spherical geometry is the geometry on the surface of earth.
Folklore
Geodesics. Consider the 2-dimensional sphere
S2
r := {(x, y, ζ) ∈R3 : x2 + y2 + ζ2 = r2}
of radius r. The equator and the meridian circles passing through both North Pole
and South Pole are called geodesic lines of the sphere. More precisely, a curve
on the sphere is called a geodesic line (or a spherical straight line) iﬀit is the
intersection between the sphere S2
r and a plane which passes through the origin
(0, 0, 0). Connected subarcs of geodesic lines are called geodesics.27 If a geodesic
connects the two points A and B on the sphere S2
r and the length of the geodesic
is less or equal to πr, then it is a curve of shortest length. If an airplane wants to
ﬂy from point A to point B by using a route of shortest distance, then it has to ﬂy
along a geodesic of shortest length (see Fig. 5.9 on page 277).
Geodesic triangles. Consider a triangle ABC as pictured in Fig. 5.14(a). The
sides of the triangle are geodesics of shortest length. For the sum of the angles
α, β, γ, we have
α + β + γ = π + KA.
(5.62)
Here, K = 1/r2 is the Gaussian curvature of the sphere S2
r, and A is the spherical
area of the triangle. In contrast to this, for a triangle in Euclidean geometry, we
27 The term geodesic was introduced by Liouville (1809–1882) in 1850 and was
taken from geodesy.

5.9 Spherical Geometry
303
have α + β + γ = π. Formula (5.62) allows us to measure the radius of earth, by
measuring the angles and the surface area of a triangle on earth.
We will show below that equation (5.62) remains valid in hyperbolic geometry,
if we set K = −1 and A denotes the hyperbolic area of the hyperbolic triangle (Fig
5.14(b)). Formally, this is obtained by starting with K = 1/r2. Now replace the
radius r of the sphere by the imaginary radius ir. Finally, set r = 1. This way, we
get K = −1.
The Pythagorean theorem. For the spherical geodesic triangle ABC with
geodesic sides of shortest length, and angles α, β, γ together with the special choice
γ := π
2 (Fig. 5.14 ), we get the spherical Pythagorean theorem
cos
“a
r
”
= cos
„ b
r
«
cos
“ c
r
”
.
(5.63)
Here, a, b, c is the length of the sides BC, CA, AB, respectively.
Now consider the geodesic triangle ABC in hyperbolic geometry pictured in Fig.
5.14(b). As we will show below, in hyperbolic geometry, geodesics are semicircles
centered at the x-axis. Formally, replacing r by ir and setting r = 1 and noting
that cos(iϕ) = cosh ϕ, we get the hyperbolic Pythagorean theorem
cosh a = cosh b cosh c.
This formula can be rigorously justiﬁed.
Finally, let us study the Euclidean limit case r →+∞. Since we have the
approximation formula cos ϕ = 1 −1
2ϕ2 + O(ϕ4) as ϕ →+∞, it follows from (5.63)
that
a2 + b2 = c2 + O
„ 1
r2
«
,
r →+∞.
Letting r →+∞, we get
a2 + b2 = c2.
This is the classical Pythagorean theorem in Euclidean geometry.
5.9.1 The Global Gauss–Bonnet Theorem
There exists a deep relation between curvature and topology. The prototype is the
famous Gauss–Bonnet formula
Z
S2r
K
2π dA = χ(S2
r),
(5.64)
where χ(S2
r) = 2 is the Euler characteristic of the sphere S2
r. In order to discuss this
formula, consider ﬁrst the triangulation of the unit sphere (i.e., r = 1) pictured in
Fig. 5.15(a). Here, we have four geodesic triangles. For each triangle, we get
α + β + γ = π + A
(5.65)
with α = β = π
2 , γ = π, and A = 1
4 meas(S2) = π. The Euler characteristic of this
triangulation is given by the following Euler polyhedron formula
χ = T −S + V.
(5.66)
Here, T (resp. S and V ) is the number of triangles (resp. sides of triangles and
vertices). Explicitly, T = 4, S = 6, V = 4. Hence χ = 2. The Euler characteristic χ

Fig. 5.15. The global Gauss–Bonnet theorem
does not depend on the choice of the triangulation. Consider, for example, the trian-
gulation pictured in Fig. 5.15(b). Then we have the numbers T = 8, S = 12, V = 6.
Again T −S + V = 2. The point is that the most important topological invariant –
the Euler characteristic – can be obtained in terms of analysis by integrating over
a density ϱ(x, y) :=
K(x,y)
2π
. The integral (5.64) is called a topological charge in
physics.
The Gauss–Bonnet formula relates analysis and diﬀerential geometry (i.e.,
curvature) to topology.
For a long time, it was a famous open problem to ﬁnd the generalization of the
Gauss–Bonnet theorem to higher dimension. This problem was solved by Chern
(1911–2004) in 1945.28 Motivated by this problem, Chern created the theory of
characteristic classes. Let us explain this for the sphere. If we use the volume form
υ(S2
r) with
Z
S2r
υ(S2
r) = meas(S2
r) = 4πr2,
then the form γ := K
2π υ is called the Chern form, and we have

γ = χ(S2

If μ is a 1-form on S2
r, then

This shows the relation to de Rham cohomology, as we will discuss next.

5.9.2 De Rham Cohomology and the Chern Class of the Sphere
Cohomology is deeply routed in the following topics: Gauss’ surface theory,
the Kirchhoﬀ–Weyl theory of electrical networks, and Maxwell’s theory of
electromagnetism. Cohomology lies at the heart of both modern diﬀerential
topology and modern quantum ﬁeld theory (the BRST approach).29
Folklore
Recall de Rham cohomology from Sect. 16.8.2 of Vol. I. Two smooth diﬀerential
2-forms ω and σ on S2
r are called equivalent, ω ∼σ, iﬀthere exists a smooth 1-form
on S2
r such that
ω = σ + dμ
on S2
r.
The equivalence class [ω] corresponding to ω is called the de Rham cohomology
class of ω. All the de Rham cohomology classes of 2-forms on S2
r form a real 1-
dimensional linear space called the second cohomology group H2(S2
r) of the sphere
(in the sense of de Rham). By (5.67), the Euler characteristic of S2
r only depends
on the cohomology class [γ] of the Chern form γ. This cohomology class is called
the ﬁrst Chern class of the sphere S2
r. We write c1(S2
r) = [γ]. The Chern class [γ] is
a generator of the second cohomology group H2(S2
r) of the sphere.
Representing de Rham cohomology classes by harmonic forms (Hodge
theory). Riemann based his approach to complex analysis on the Laplacian. In the
1930s, Hodge generalized Riemann’s theory in a substantial way. We will study this
in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics. At this point, we would like to sketch the
following. To begin with, let us introduce spherical coordinates, namely,
• geographic length ϕ : −π < ϕ ≤π, and
• geographic latitude ϑ: −π
2 ≤ϑ ≤π
2 .
In particular, the points on the equator, the North Pole, the South Pole have the
geographic latitude ϑ = 0, π
2 , −π
2 , respectively (Fig. 5.16).30 Mnemonically, the
Riemannian metric on S2
r is given by
ds2 = r2 cos2 ϑ · dϕ2 + r2dϑ2,
and the volume form reads as υ = r2 cos2 ϑ dϕ ∧dϑ. Every smooth curve on the
sphere, C : ϕ = ϕ(τ), ϑ = ϑ(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, has the length
l(C) =
Z τ1
τ0
˙s(τ) dτ =

r2 cos2 ϑ(τ) · ˙ϕ(τ)2 + r2 ˙ϑ(τ)2 dτ.
29 Both the classical roots and the modern extensions will be thoroughly studied
in Vol. III on gauge theory and in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics.
30 To avoid technicalities, we exclude the North Pole and the South Pole. The full
approach has to be based on this coordinate system and two local coordinate
systems at both the north and the south pole.

Let C∞(S2
r) denote the set of all smooth functions f : S2

• df = fϕdϕ + fϑdϑ,
• d(fdϕ + gdϑ) = df ∧dϕ + dg ∧dϑ,
• d(fdϕ ∧dϑ) = 0.
The Hodge star operator is deﬁned as follows:
• ∗1 := υ, and ∗υ = 1,
• ∗f = fυ, and ∗(fυ) = f,
• ∗

Let Ωp(S2

Introducing the inner product
⟨ω|μ⟩:=

S2r
ω ∧∗μ,
for all
ω, μ ∈Ωp(S2

the space Ωp(S2
r) becomes a real pre-Hilbert space for p = 0, 1, 2. In particular, for
p = 0, we have Ω0(S2

⟨f|g⟩=

This is the usual inner product on the sphere S2

We deﬁne the operator
d∗:= −∗d ∗.
Then, ⟨ω|dμ⟩= ⟨d∗ω|μ⟩for all ω, μ ∈Ωp(S2
r) with p = 0, 1, 2. That is, the operator
d∗is the adjoint operator to the Cartan operator d. Now to the point. The operator
Δ := dd∗+ d∗d
(5.68)
is called the Laplacian (or the Laplace–Beltrami operator) of the sphere S2
r. For
example, if f ∈C∞(S2
r), then
Δf = −
fϕϕ
r2 cos2 ϑ −fϑϑ
r2 −tan ϑ · fϑ

.
This is the usual Laplacian written in spherical coordinates with constant radius
r. Let ω ∈Ωp(S2
r) for ﬁxed p = 0, 1, 2. Then the following two statements are
equivalent:
(i) Δω = 0 on S2
r (Laplace equation on the sphere).
(ii) dω = 0 and d∗ω = 0 on S2
r (Yang–Mills equation on the sphere).
The p-form ω is called harmonic iﬀ(i) is satisﬁed. All the possible harmonic forms
on the sphere are given as follows:
• harmonic 0-forms: ω ≡a with a ∈R,
• harmonic 1-forms: ω ≡0,
• harmonic 2-forms: ω = a(∗1) with a ∈R.

5.9 Spherical Geometry
307
The main result of Hodge theory is the following one:31
For a compact Riemannian manifold M, every de Rham cohomology class
contains precisely one harmonic form.
Consequently, the de Rham cohomology class Hq(M) is isomorphic to the real
linear space of all harmonic q-forms. The dimension
βq := dim Hq(M),
q = 0, 1, . . . , n
is called the q-th Betti number of the n-dimensional manifold M. Moreover, the
alternating sum
χ(M) = β0 −β1 + β2 −. . . + (−1)nβn
is called the Euler characteristic of M. Note the following:
• The de Rham cohomology works for all compact manifolds. We do not need any
additional mathematical structure.
• In contrast to this, Hodge theory can only be applied to compact Riemannian
manifolds. We need the additional metric structure in order to introduce the
Hodge star operator, and hence the Laplacian.
In particular, for the sphere, we get H0(S2
r) = H2(S2
r) = R and H1(S2
r) = 0. Hence
β0 = β2 = 1,
β1 = 0.
The relation β0 = β2 is called the Poincar´e duality of the sphere. For the Euler
characteristic of the sphere, we get
χ(S2
r) = β0 −β1 + β2 = 1 −1 + 1 = 2.
In terms of topology, the following holds:
• β0 = 1 tells us that the sphere S2
r is path-connected, that is, two points on the
sphere can always be connected by a continuous path.
• β1 = 0 tells us that the sphere is simply connected. That is, every closed contin-
uous curve on the sphere can be continuously contracted into a point.
• β2 = 1 tells us that the sphere is orientable.
Note the following:
• Cohomology: The deﬁnition of the Euler characteristic above in terms of diﬀer-
ential forms, displays the analytic character of this quantity. This corresponds to
cohomology in topology.
• Homology: The Euler characteristic can also be characterized by the Euler poly-
hedron formula (5.66) in terms of triangulations of the basic manifolds. The Euler
polyhedron formula is the starting point for homology in topology.
Surprisingly enough, the two completely diﬀerent approaches yield the same quan-
tity. This is the deep duality between homology and cohomology. In terms of physics,
this means that there exists a deep relation between the geometric structure of the
space-time manifold (homology) and the physical ﬁelds that live on the space-time
manifold (cohomology).

5.9.3 The Beltrami Model
Beltrami’s model of elliptic geometry. Choose the radius r = 1 of the sphere.
The stereographic projection pictured in Fig. 5.17 maps the unit sphere (minus
North Pole) S2 \ {N} onto the complex plane C in a bijective manner. Explicitly,
the point (ξ, η, ζ) on the unit sphere corresponds to the point z = x + iy in the
complex plane C given by
z = ξ + iη
1 −ζ .
In particular, the South Pole goes to the origin z = 0, and the equator is mapped
onto the unit circle. For a given smooth curve on the unit sphere,
ξ = ξ(τ), η = η(τ), ζ = ζ(τ),
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1,
we get the following transformation formulas:
˙ξ(τ)2 + ˙η(τ)2 + ˙ζ(τ)2 =
˙x(τ)2 + ˙y(τ)2
(x(τ)2 + y(τ)2 + 1)2 .
This allows us to transplant the metric from the unit sphere to the complex plane
C. Explicitly,
ds2 = dx2 + dy2
1 + x2 + y2 .
(5.69)
By deﬁnition, the elliptic Beltrami model Bellip consists of the open unit disc
B := {(x, y) ∈R2 : x2 + y2 < 1}
equipped with the Riemannian metric (5.69).
Beltrami’s hyperbolic model. Using the rescaling x →rx and y →ry and
setting r := i, the Riemannian metric (5.69) passes over to the metric
ds2 = dx2 + dy2
1 −x2 −y2
(5.70)
on the open unit disc B. This yields the hyperbolic Beltrami model Bhyp. Published
in 1868, this was the ﬁrst model in the history of mathematics which globally
realized Lobachevsky’s hyperbolic geometry on a subset of the Euclidean plane
equipped with a non-Euclidean Riemannian metric. We will show in Problem 5.6
that this model is equivalent to the 1881 Poincar´e model on the open upper half-
plane to be considered in the next section. Next let us discuss the diﬀerent local
and global properties of the hyperbolic Beltrami model.

Fig. 5.18. Pseudosphere
The pseudosphere of Gauss. Consider the curve r = r(ζ) pictured in Fig.
5.18(a). This so-called tractrix was ﬁrst studied by Leibniz (1646–1716). The trac-
trix has the following characteristic property: If we consider the tangent to the curve
through a point C, which intersects the ζ-axis at the point D, then the length of
the segment CD is constant. The name tractrix comes from the fact that the curve
arises when a dog at the point D pulls a cart at the point C in direction of the
ζ-axis. This is a situation which earlier often actually occurred in mining.32 The
pseudosphere Spseudo is obtained through rotation of the tractrix about the ζ-axis in
a Cartesian (ξ, η, ζ)-coordinate system (Fig. 5.18(b)). Introducing polar coordinates

The Gaussian curvature. Using local real coordinates u, v, Gauss describes
the local metric properties of a smooth surface by the ﬁrst fundamental form:
ds2 = E(u, v)du2 + 2F(u, v)dudv + G(u, v)dv2.
Mnemonically, this means that the curve length of a given smooth curve on the
surface, C : u = u(τ), v = v(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, is equal to
l(C) =

the curve parameter τ. To introduce the Gaussian curvature K(P) of the surface at
the point P, we choose a Cartesian (x, y, ζ)-coordinate system at the point, where
the (x, y)-plane is the tangent plane of the surface at the point P (Fig. 5.19).

The dots stand for terms of higher order (i.e., o(x2 + y2) as x2 + y2 →0). The
principal axis theorem for quadratic forms tells us that this normal form is always
possible, after a suitable rotation of the (x, y, ζ-coordinate system about the ζ-axis.
Now we deﬁne the Gaussian curvature K(P) of the surface at the point P by setting
K(P) := ab.
(5.71)
This means that curvature depends on the local quadratic terms of the Taylor
expansion. In particular, for a sphere of radius r, say, near the south pole, we get

The theorema egregium of Gauss – a gem of mathematics and physics.
The Gaussian curvature is deﬁned by using the surrounding space. Gauss posed the
following fundamental question:
Is it possible to compute the Gaussian curvature without using the sur-
rounding space, but only by using the functions E, F, G of the intrinsic
metric?
After tedious computations, Gauss found the answer. The theorema egregium tells
us that the Gaussian curvature K only depends on the metric functions E, F, G and
their partial derivatives up to second order. Explicitly, there holds the following
universal formula:33

I hardly know any period of my life, where I earned so little real gain for
truly exhausting work, as during this winter. I found many, many beautiful
things, but my work on other things has been unsuccessful for months.
Finally, on October 8, 1827, Gauss presented the general surface theory. The title of
his paper was Disquisitiones circa superﬁcies curvas (Investigations about curved
surfaces) (in Latin). The most important result of this masterpiece of mathematics
is the theorema egregium. Gauss proved that
Curvature is an intrinsic property of a 2-dimensional manifold which is
equipped with the notion of arc length.
In particular, for the pseudosphere with pseudoradius r = 1, the theorema egregium
yields K ≡−1 (outside the singular equator). Riemann generalized Gauss’ work to
higher dimensions. Erich Worbs writes:34
In 1854 Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866) presented three topics for his in-
augural lecture in G¨ottingen. Gauss (1777–1855), in recollection of his own
struggle with Euclid’s parallel axiom, chose – in breaking with tradition –
the third one: On the hypotheses which lie at the foundation of geometry.
In his lecture Riemann presented the fundamentals of a geometry for the
n-dimensional curved metric space (nowadays called Riemannian geome-
try). This must have made an extremely deep impression on Gauss, who
at that time was already very weak. Later, on his way home, he spoke with
unusual excitement to Wilhelm Weber about the depth of the presentation.
Riemann considered all the 2-dimensional submanifolds of an n-dimensional Rie-
mannian manifold and computed their Gauss curvature. This family of Gauss cur-
vatures forms the Riemann curvature tensor. Einstein used the Riemann curva-
ture tensor in order to intrinsically describe gravitation as the curvature of the
4-dimensional space-time manifold. In the Standard Model of elementary parti-
cle physics, strong interaction and electroweak interaction are intrinsically rep-
resented by the curvature of a principal ﬁber bundle with the structure group
U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) (see Vol. III). Here, the structure group describes the pos-
sible gauge transformations.
Hilbert’s no-go theorem for the embedding of the global hyperbolic
Beltrami manifold into the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. Hilbert proved
in 1901 that the hyperbolic Beltrami manifold Bhyp (and hence also the hyperbolic
Poincar´e plane HR) cannot be isometrically embedded into the space R3. The precise
deﬁnition of an isometric embedding will be given on page 312. Intuitively, Hilbert
showed that the hyperbolic Beltrami model cannot be realized on a submanifold
of R3 in such a way that the arc length of curves is preserved.35 Note that the
pseudosphere is not a submanifold of R3, since there are no tangent planes at the
points of the equator. The hyperbolic Beltrami model can be locally realized on the
pseudosphere, but not globally. For a long time, it was an open problem whether
Riemannian manifolds can be isometrically embedded into a Euclidean space Rm
of suﬃciently high dimension m. This problem was positively solved by John Nash
in 1956.
The Nash embedding theorem and the sophisticated regularization
method (hard implicit function theorem). Let n = 1, 2, . . . There are the
following two crucial embedding theorems:

lang, Leipzig (in German).

and Fields, Sect. 4.3.4, Amer. Math. Soc., Providence, Rhode Island, 2006.

(W) Every paracompact real n-dimensional manifold can be embedded into the Eu-
clidean space R2n+1 (Whitney’s embedding theorem from 1936).36
(N) Every paracompact real n-dimensional Riemannian manifold can be isometri-
cally embedded into some Euclidean space Rm, where m = O(n3) as n →∞
(Nash’s embedding theorem from 1956).
Here, we use the following terminology. In this series of monographs, manifolds are
always assumed to be smooth (see Sect. 5.4 of Vol. I). Moreover, a manifold is called
paracompact iﬀit possesses a ﬁnite or at most countable system of local coordinate
systems (i.e., charts). Compact manifolds are paracompact. But, the converse is not
true. For example, the real line R (or the space Rm with m ≥1 ) is paracompact,
but not compact. The map χ : M →N from the manifold M into the manifold N
is called an embedding if and only if
• the image χ(M) is a submanifold of N, and
• the map χ : M →χ(M) is a diﬀeomorphism.
We say that the manifold M can be embedded into the manifold N iﬀthere exists
an embedding χ : M →N. This deﬁnition excludes certain pathologies (e.g., self-
intersections; see Fig. 5.20(b)).
A real manifold is called Riemannian (resp. pseudo-Riemannian) iﬀeach tangent
space is equipped with the structure of a real Hilbert space (resp. indeﬁnite Hilbert
space), and the inner product depends smoothly on the point (with respect to local
coordinates). Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds will be thoroughly
studied in Vol. III (e.g., the 4-dimensional space-time in general relativity is pseudo-
Riemannian).
The map χ : M →N between two Riemannian manifolds M and N is called
an isometry iﬀit is a length-preserving diﬀeomorphism from M onto N. The map
χ : M →N is called an isometric embedding iﬀit is a length-preserving embedding.
Then the map χ is an isometry from M onto the image χ(M).
In order to formulate a typical theorem on embeddings, ﬁx 1 ≤m ≤n. Let U
be a nonempty open subset of Rm.

36 For the proof, we refer to Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV, p. 588 (see the references on
page 1049). The reader might wonder why the dimension 2n + 1 appears. The
point is that one needs additional information about the tangent spaces in the
proof. Therefore, one has to use the tangent bundle TM of the manifold M; the
tangent bundle consists of all the pairs (x, v) where x is an arbitrary point of the
manifold, and v is an arbitrary tangent vector at the point x ∈M. As Whitney
showed, one needs an extra dimension in order to realize the 2n-dimensional
tangent bundle TM in R2n+1.

has the rank=m for all parameter values τ ∈U, and the inverse mapping
F −1 : F(U) →U is continuous.
Then we say that the real m-dimensional submanifold F(U) of the target space Rn
is an embedded manifold of Rn. To illustrate this standard theorem in the theory
of manifolds, let us consider two simple examples:
(i) Curves in R3 : Set F(t) := (x(t), y(t), z(t)). Let U be an open interval of the
real line R. The smooth injective map F : U →R3 is an embedding iﬀ
˙x(t)2 + ˙y(t)2 + ˙z(t)2 ̸= 0
for all
t ∈U,
and the inverse map F −1 : F(U) →U is continuous. Then the image F(U) is
called an embedded curve of R3 (Fig. 5.20(a)).
In particular, choose x(t) :≡t, z(t) :≡0. Then F(x) = (x, y(x), 0). Here, F(x)
lives in the (x, y)-plane. The smooth map
F : U →R3,
corresponding to the plane curve y = y(x), is an embedding iﬀy′(x) ̸= 0 for
all x ∈U.
(ii) Surfaces in R3: Set F(x, y) := (f(x, y), g(x, y), z(x, y)). Let U be a nonempty
open subset of R2. The smooth injective map F : U →R3 is an embedding iﬀ
the linearization
F ′(x, y) :=
 
fx(x, y) gx(x, y) zx(x, y)
fy(x, y) gy(x, y) zy(x, y)
!
has rank =2 for all (x, y) ∈U, and F −1 : F(U) →U is continuous. Then the
set F(U) is called an embedded surface of R3.
In particular, choose f(x, y) :≡x, g(x, y) :≡y. Hence F(x, y) = (x, y, z(x, y)).
Then the smooth map
F : U →R3,
corresponding to the surface equation z = z(x, y), is an embedding iﬀ
zx(x, y)2 + zy(x, y)2 ̸= 0
for all
(x, y) ∈U.
This condition means that the surface has the tangent plane
(x −x0)zx(x0, y0) + zy(x0, x0)(y −y0) −z(x0, y0) = 0
at every point (x0, y0, z(x0, y0)) with (x0, y0) ∈U.
In order to prove his embedding theorem, John Nash had to solve a nonlinear system
(S) of partial diﬀerential equations. Unfortunately, the classical implicit function
theorem failed. The corresponding iterative method for (S) has the nasty property
that the functions loose smoothness in each iterative step. To cure this defect, Nash
invented a reﬁned iteration technique:
The idea is to regularize the iterated functions in each step and to use the
fast convergence of the Newton method in order to compensate the eﬀects
caused by the modiﬁcations.

Fig. 5.21. Klein’s model of hyperbolic geometry
This approach was further developed by J¨urgen Moser (1928–1999) in 1966. Nowa-
days there exists a well-established mathematical tool called the hard implicit func-
tion theorem, which allows many interesting applications to sophisticated problems
arising in celestial mechanics and the theory of partial diﬀerential equations (see the
papers by Moser and Hamilton, and the monograph by Krantz and Parker quoted
on page 352). There also exist interesting relations to problems arising in quantum
ﬁeld theory (see the papers by Bricmont, Gaw¸edzki, and Kupiainen quoted on page
353).37
The elegant method of gauge ﬁxing. In 1989, Matthias G¨unther showed
that the proof of the Nash embedding theorem can be simpliﬁed substantially (see
the paper quoted on page 352). The basic idea is to add appropriate constraints
to the underdetermined system (S) of nonlinear ﬁrst-order partial diﬀerential equa-
tions in order to enforce the application of the classical implicit function theorem.
Klein’s projective model of hyperbolic geometry. In 1871, the young
Felix Klein (1849–1925) published the following model. Consider the open unit
disc K := {z ∈C : |z| < 1}. By deﬁnition, “straight lines” are subsets of K that
correspond to circles, which orthogonally intersect the unit circle (Fig. 5.21). The
points of the unit circle are the ”points of inﬁnity.” For given two diﬀerent points
z, w ∈K, there exists a uniquely determined “straight line” which passes through
z and w. The “distance” between the points z and w is deﬁned to be the positive
number
d(z, w) := ln
„ z −z∞
z −w∞: w −z∞
w −w∞
«
.
It turns out that this model based on the cross ratio is equivalent to Lobachevsky’s
hyperbolic geometry. Note that the cross ratio is the most important invariant in
projective geometry. In contrast to the Beltrami model, the elementary Klein model
does not use the theory of Riemannian manifolds.
5.10 The Poincar´e Model of Hyperbolic Geometry
The Poincar´e model is the most elegant formulation of hyperbolic non-
Euclidean geometry.
Folklore
Elements of the following model were introduced by Henri Poincar´e (1854–1912) in
1881. After a long discussion with Felix Klein, Poincar´e presented the ﬁnal form of
this model in his famous monograph “La science et l’hypoth`ese,” Paris, 1902. In
37 For the creation of the theory of non-cooperative games based on Nash-
equilibrium states (Ann. of Math. 54 (1951), 286–295), John Nash (born 1928)
was awarded the Nobel prize in economics in 1994. His biography can be found
in the bestseller by S. Nasar, A Beautiful Mind, Simon and Schuster, New York,
1998, which was the basis for a Hollywood movie.

Hyperbolic plane. The upper half-plane HR equipped with the metric (5.74)
is called the real hyperbolic plane. Similarly, HC equipped with the metric (5.75)
is called the complex hyperbolic plane. Note that:
• The real hyperbolic plane HR is a real 2-dimensional manifold.
• The complex hyperbolic plane HC is a complex 1-dimensional manifold.
The geometry corresponding to the refraction index (5.73) is called hyperbolic ge-
ometry.
Hyperbolic geodesics. By (5.57) on page 300, the equation for geodesics
corresponding to the refraction index n(x, y) = 1
y reads as
¨x = 2 ˙x ˙y
y ,
¨y = ˙y2 −˙x2
y
.
(5.76)
Proposition 5.11 The geodesics of the hyperbolic plane are obtained as follows:
Consider all circles and straight lines of the complex plane which orthogonally in-
tersect the x-axis, and restrict them to the open upper half-plane.
The points of the x-axis are called the ”points of inﬁnity” of the hyperbolic plane.
Maximal geodesics are called straight lines (Fig. 5.22).
Proof. (I) Let y ≡const. The second equation of (5.76) yields x ≡const. This
is a point, but not a curve. Thus, the curve y ≡const is not a geodesic.
(II) We are looking for a geodesic of the form x = (y). Instead of using the
system (5.76), it is easier to use the variational problem
38 Rigorously, we have to use the metric tensors dx⊗dx+dy⊗dy

Hyperbolic parallels and the violation of Euclid’s parallel axiom. In
Euclidean geometry, for any given point P0 outside a given straight line G, there
exists precisely one straight line which does not intersect G. This is called a parallel
straight line to G.
In the hyperbolic geometry of the real hyperbolic plane, geodesic lines are also
called hyperbolic straight lines. Then, for any given point P0 outside a given hyper-
bolic straight line G, there exist inﬁnitely many hyperbolic straight lines through
the point P0 which do not intersect G. In other words, there exist inﬁnitely many hy-
perbolic parallel straight lines to G which pass through the point P0 (Fig. 5.23(b)).
Consequently, the hyperbolic geometry of the real hyperbolic plane repre-
sents a non-Euclidean geometry.
The real (resp. and complex) hyperbolic plane is equipped with the following math-
ematical structures:
• complete metric space,
• Riemannian manifold,
• non-compact Riemann surface,
• K¨ahler manifold, and
• symplectic manifold.
In what follows we want to discuss this.
The hyperbolic plane as a complete metric space with respect to
geodesic distance. We are given the two points P, Q ∈HC. Let the curve

5.10 The Poincar´e Model of Hyperbolic Geometry
317
C : z = z(τ),
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1
be a geodesic which connects the point P with Q (see Fig. 5.22 on page 315). Using
the so-called geodesic distance deﬁned by
d(P, Q) := l(C),
where l(C) is the hyperbolic arc length of the geodesic C, the complex hyperbolic
plane becomes a metric space. This means that, for arbitrary points P, Q, S ∈HC,
the following hold:
(M1) d(P, Q) ≥0 and d(P, Q) = 0 iﬀP = Q,
[M2) d(P, Q) = d(Q, P),
(M3) d(P, Q) ≤d(P, S) + d(S, Q).
Moreover, the complex hyperbolic plane is a complete metric space. By deﬁnition,
this means that each Cauchy sequence is convergent.39
The symmetry group of the hyperbolic geometry. Consider the M¨obius
transformation40
w = αz + β
γz + δ
with real coeﬃcients α, β, γ, δ and αδ −βγ ̸= 0. Each of these transformations
represents a conformal diﬀeomorphism from the complex hyperbolic plane HC onto
itself. The set of all these transformations
T : HC →HC
forms a group Sym(HC), which is called the symmetry group of the complex hyper-
bolic plane HC. By deﬁnition, precisely the invariants under this group are proper-
ties of hyperbolic geometry on HC . Examples are: arc length, angle, surface area,
geodesic line, geodesic distance, and Gaussian curvature.
The action of the real symplectic group SL(2, R) on the complex hy-
perbolic plane. The map
 
α β
γ δ
!
→αz + β
γz + δ
(5.77)
is a group morphism from the group SL(2, R) onto the group Sym(HC). Precisely
the unit matrix I and −I are mapped to the identical M¨obius transformation with
α = δ = 1 and β = γ = 0 Consequently, we have the group isomorphism
Sym(HC) ≃SL(2, R)/{±I}.
Next we want to study the curvature properties of the hyperbolic plane. This
can be done most elegantly by using the notion of K¨ahler manifold.
39 A sequence (Pn) of points in HC is called Cauchy iﬀ, for any ε > 0, there exists
an index n0 such that d(Pn, Pm) < ε for all n, m ≥n0. Completeness means that,
for any Cauchy sequence (Pn), there exists a point P in the complex hyperbolic
plane such that limn→+∞d(Pn, P) = 0.

5.10.1 K¨ahler Geometry and the Gaussian Curvature
Many important manifolds arising in mathematics and physics (e.g., Rie-
mann surfaces) can be equipped with an Hermitean K¨ahler metric.
Folklore
Erich K¨ahler’s seminal article On a remarkable Hermitean metric41 has
grown into a domain in itself. What is even more striking concerning this
article is that more or less every half page, Erich K¨ahler opens a new path
that has later turned out to be crucial for the development of the subject.
Jean-Piere Bourguignon, 2004
There are the following three fundamental geometries used in physics:
(i) symplectic geometry (geometrical optics and classical mechanics),
(ii) Riemannian und pseudo-Riemannian geometry (general theory of relativity on
gravitation),
(iii) unitary geometry and Hilbert spaces (quantum theory).
K¨ahler geometry combines these three essential mathematical structures with each
other. In fact, K¨ahler geometry plays a fundamental role in complex geometry,
algebraic geometry, and string theory. We will study this in later volumes. We refer
to the hints for further reading on K¨ahler geometry to be found on page 350. At
this point, we will only discuss a few basic ideas.
Our goal is to use the complexiﬁcation HC of the real 2-dimensional hyper-
bolic plane HR in order to simplify computations, by using methods from complex
analysis. To this end, we introduce the following notation:
• z := x + iy and ¯z := x −iy (variables),
• dz := dx + idy and d¯z := dx −idy (diﬀerentials),
• ∂x =
∂
∂x and ∂y =
∂
∂y (partial derivatives),
• ∂z := ∂x −i∂y and ∂¯z := ∂x + i∂y,
• ∂:= ∂z · dz and ¯∂:= ∂¯z · d¯z.
In particular, for the smooth function U : HC →C, we get the diﬀerential forms
¯∂U(z) = ∂¯zU(z) d¯z, and
∂¯∂U(z) = ∂z∂¯zU(z) dz ∧d¯z,
z ∈HC.
(5.78)
The function U is called the K¨ahler potential of the 2-form located on the right-hand
side of (5.78).
The Riemann surface. By deﬁnition, complex one-dimensional connected
manifolds are called Riemann surfaces. The complex hyperbolic plane HC is a (non-
compact) Riemann surface.42
Tangent space. Consider the complex hyperbolic plane HC. Fix the point
P := z0. Let z = z(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, be a smooth curve on HC through the point
P, that is, say, z(0) = z0 and 0 ∈]τ0, τ1[. Then the derivative v := ˙z(0) is called a
tangent vector of HC at the point P. The set of all possible tangent vectors v at the
point P is called the tangent space TP HC of HC at the point P. For all v, w ∈TP HC,
we will use the following deﬁnitions:

surfaces is studied in J. Jost, Compact Riemann Surfaces: An Introduction to

• dxP (v) := ℜ(v) and dyP (v) := ℑ(v),
• dzP (v) := v and d¯zP (v) := ¯v,
• (dz ⊗d¯z)P (v, w) := dzP (v)d¯zP (w) = v ¯w,
• (d¯z ⊗dz)P (v, w) = d¯zP (v)dzP (w) := ¯vw.
Moreover, dz ∧d¯z := dz ⊗d¯z −d¯z ⊗dz. Hence
• (dz ∧d¯z)P (v, w) = v ¯w −¯vw for all v, w ∈TP HC.
The two fundamental bilinear tensor ﬁelds on the complex hyperbolic
plane. Let us introduce
• the complex-valued Hermitean metric tensor ﬁeld h := n(z)2 dz ⊗d¯z and
• the real-valued K¨ahler 2-form κ := i
2n(z)2 dz ∧d¯z
on the complex manifold HC. Here, z →n(z) is a given smooth function with
positive values on HC.43 Trivially, we have
dκ = 0,
since dκ = i
2d(n(z)2) ∧dz ∧d¯z, and wedge products with three factors of the form
dx, dy vanish identically. However, in complex dimensions > 1, the condition dκ = 0
represents a crucial restriction on the structure of K¨ahler manifolds. The tensor ﬁeld
h is called Hermitean, since the map (v, w) →h(v, w) represents an Hermitean form.
That is, the following conditions are satisﬁed for all points P ∈HC and all tangent
vectors u, v, w ∈TP HC, as well as all complex numbers α, β:
• hP (v, w) ∈C and hP (v, w)† = hP (w, v),
• hP (αu + βv, w) = αhP (u, w) + βhP (v, w).
Deﬁne
⟨v|w⟩P := hP (v, w)†
for all
v, w ∈TP HC
and all points P ∈HC.
This way, the tangent space TP C becomes a one-dimensional complex
Hilbert space equipped with the inner product ⟨.|.⟩.
In particular, we have ⟨w|αu+βv⟩P = α⟨w|u⟩P +β⟨w|v⟩P for all complex numbers
α, β.44 Now we are able to apply the theory of complex Hilbert spaces. According
to Sect. 5.8.2, for all tangent vectors v, w ∈TP HC, we deﬁne:45
⟨v|w⟩R := ℜ(⟨v|w⟩)
and
κP (v, w) := ℑ(⟨v|w⟩).
Note that the deﬁnition of κ coincides with the K¨ahler form introduced above. If
we regard the tangent space TP HC = C as a real 2-dimensional space CR, this space
becomes a real Hilbert space equipped with the inner product ⟨v|w⟩R. This corre-
sponds to the Riemannian structure on the real manifold HR, where the tangent
spaces TP HR are isomorphic to R2, as real spaces.
43 Explicitly, for all v, w ∈C, we have
hP (v, w) = n(z)2v ¯w,
κP (v, w) = i
2n(z)2(v ¯w −w¯v).
Note that, in the present case, the tangent space TP HC coincides with C. How-
ever, we are going to use a language which prepares the generalization to arbi-
trary K¨ahler manifolds on page 323.
44 This is the convention used by physicists for inner products (in order to ﬁt the
Dirac calculus). In this series of monographs, we adopt this convention.
45 All of the expressions depend on the choice of the point P in HC. To simplify
notation, we suppress the index P.

Hermitean forms are named after Charles Hermite (1822–1901) who studied
the principal axis transformation for complex self-adjoint matrices. To this end,
he had to replace real quadratic forms by complex-valued expressions which are
called Hermitean forms nowadays. Henri Poincar´e (1854–1912), one of the greatest
mathematicians of all times, was a student of Hermite at the Ecole Polytechnique
in Paris.
Hyperbolic geometry. In order to get the hyperbolic geometry, we choose
the refraction index function
n(z) := 1
y
for all
z ∈HC.
Gauss based his theory of 2-dimensional surfaces on two symmetric bilinear tensor
ﬁelds (called the ﬁrst and second fundamental form). ´Elie Cartan noticed that it
is very convenient to use antisymmetric bilinear forms, too. In modern diﬀerential
geometry, Cartan’s antisymmetric diﬀerential forms play a fundamental role (e.g.,
the curvature form to be considered below).
Hyperbolic arc length. Let C : z = z(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, be a smooth curve on
HC. The hyperbolic arc length of C is equal to
l(C) =
Z τ1
τ0
|| ˙z(τ)|| dτ =
Z τ1
τ0
p
˙x(τ)2 + ˙y(τ)2
y(τ)
dτ.
Hyperbolic angle. Let z = zj(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, j = 1, 2, be two smooth curves
passing through the point P, that is, say, zj(0) = z0 for j = 1, 2, and 0 ∈]τ0, τ1[. By
deﬁnition, the hyperbolic angle α between the two curves at the intersection point
P is deﬁned by46
cos α =
ℜ⟨˙z1| ˙z2⟩
|| ˙z1|| · || ˙z2|| =
˙x1 ˙x2 + ˙y1 ˙y2
p
˙x2
1 + ˙y2

.
This coincides with the angle α deﬁned in Euclidean geometry.
Hyperbolic area measure. For the K¨ahler form, we get
κ = i
2n(z)2dz ∧d¯z = i
2n(z)2(dx + idy) ∧(dx −idy) = n(z)2dx ∧dy
with n(z) = 1
y . Let U be a bounded open subset of HC. The hyperbolic area of the
set U is deﬁned by
meas(U) :=
Z
U
κ.
Hence meas(U) =
R
U
1
y2 dx ∧dy =
R
U
1
y2 dxdy.
Orientation. Let v and w be two tangent vectors at the point P. Then:
• v and w are linearly independent iﬀκP (v, w) ̸= 0.
• The ordered pair (v, w) is positively oriented iﬀκP (v, w) > 0.
K¨ahler form and K¨ahler potential. Again ﬁx the point P which corresponds
to z ∈HC. Setting U(x, y) := −2i ln y, we obtain
κP = ∂z∂¯zU(z) dz ∧d¯z.
46 Here, ˙zj, ˙xj, ˙yj stand for ˙zj(0), ˙xj(0), ˙yj(0), respectively.

That is, the function U is the K¨ahler potential of κ.47 The use of potentials is crucial
in physics for simplifying the computation of forces and physical ﬁelds. For example,
in electrodynamics, the four-potential simpliﬁes the computation of solutions of the
Maxwell equations. Similarly, the K¨ahler potential simpliﬁes computations to be
performed in K¨ahler geometry.
Hyperbolic Gaussian curvature. By deﬁnition, the Gaussian curvature
K(P) of the complex hyperbolic plane HC at the point P is equal to
K(P) := −
4
n(z)2 ∂z∂¯z ln n(z).
(5.79)
This deﬁnition refers to a general smooth refraction index n : HC →R with n(z) > 0
for all z ∈HR. In the special case of hyperbolic geometry, we have n(x + iy) := y.
Then
K ≡−1.
(5.80)
Thus the hyperbolic plane has a negative constant Gauss curvature.
The Laplacian. The diﬀerential operator
Δ := −

n(z)2
∂2
∂z∂¯z = −
1
n(x, y)2
„ ∂2
∂x2 + ∂2
∂y2
«
is called the Laplacian (or the Laplace–Beltrami operator) related to the refraction
index n(x, y)). Formula (5.79) reads as
K(P) = Δ ln n(z).
The Gauss–Bonnet theorem on hyperbolic triangles. Consider a hyper-
bolic geodesic triangle as pictured in Fig. 5.14(b) on page 302. Then
α + β + γ = π + KA
(5.81)
with K = −1. For general refraction index n = n(x, y), we obtain
α + β + γ = π +
Z
T
K(x, y)n(x, y)2dxdy.
Here, we integrate over the triangle set T . If the Gaussian curvature is constant,
then we get (5.81). In particular, in the case of Euclidean geometry we have (5.81)
with K ≡0.
Sartorius von Waltershausen, a good friend of Gauss, reported that Gauss tried
to check the light-ray geometry of our universe by measuring the sum α + β + γ of
the angles α, β, γ of a huge triangle established by three light rays running between
the tops of three mountains in Germany: Hoher Hagen, Brocken, and Inselsberg.
The distance between the mountains is about 150 km. Gauss measured
α + β + γ = π,
within the limits of accuracy. Nowadays we know that the sum α + β + γ is diﬀer-
ent from π for suﬃciently large light-ray triangles, by Einstein’s theory of general
relativity.

The ﬁrst Chern class of the complex hyperbolic plane. The diﬀerential
form
γP := iK(z)n(z)2
4π
dz ∧d¯z = K(P)
2π
dx ∧dy
is called the Chern form of both the complex manifold HC and the real manifold
HR (with respect to the refraction index n). In the special case where n(x+iy) := 1
y
for all z ∈HC, we get the Chern form of both the complex and the real hyperbolic
plane. Here, K ≡−1. The corresponding cohomology class [γ] is called the ﬁrst
Chern class of both HC and HR.
The crucial point is that the ﬁrst Chern class [γ] does not depend on the
choice of the refraction index n = n(x, y). The ﬁrst Chern class reﬂects a
topological property of the real hyperbolic plane HR, namely, the orientabil-
ity of this manifold. The same is true for the complex hyperbolic plane HC.
The ﬁrst Chern class of the real hyperbolic plane is the prototype of the modern
topological theory of characteristic classes created by Chern in about 1945. Note
that characteristic classes are important topological invariants, which are frequently
encountered in modern mathematics and physics. As an introduction, we refer to
J. Milnor and Stasheﬀ, Characteristic Classes, Princeton University Press, 1974, as
well as to R. Bott and L. Tu, Diﬀerential Forms in Algebraic Topology, Springer,
New York, 1982.
Next we want to introduce the general notion of a K¨ahler manifold. For the
convenience of the reader, we start with local K¨ahler manifolds.
Local K¨ahler manifold. Fix n = 1, 2, . . . In what follows, we will use the
Einstein convention, that is, we sum over equal upper and lower indices from 1 to
n. The elements of the space Cn are the points z = (z1, . . . , zn) with zk ∈Cn for
all k = 1, . . . , n. Let U be a nonempty open subset of Cn. The two key formulas
read as follows:
hz := hr¯s(z) dzr ⊗d¯z¯s,
κz := i
2hr¯s(z) dzr ∧d¯z¯s.
(5.82)
Explicitly, for all v, w ∈Cn, we have
h(v, w) = vrhr¯s ¯w¯s,
κ(v, w) = i
2(vrhr¯s ¯w¯s −wrhr¯s¯v¯s).
By deﬁnition, the open set U is a local K¨ahler manifold with respect to h, κ iﬀthe
following hold:
• All the functions hr¯s : U →C are smooth.
• The complex (n × n)-matrix (hr¯s) is self-adjoint (also called Hermitean). That
is, hr¯s(z)† = hs¯r(z) for all r, s = 1, . . . , n.
• For any z ∈U, all the eigenvalues of the matrix (hr¯s(z)) are positive.
• dκ = 0 on U.
If we deﬁne, ⟨v|w⟩†
z := hz(v, w)† for all v, w ∈Cn, then this is an inner product on
Cn. Moreover,
κ(v, w) = ℑ(⟨v|w⟩)
for all
v, w ∈Cn.
We also deﬁne ⟨v|w⟩R := ℜ(⟨v|w⟩) for all v, w ∈Cn. We have the following key
deﬁnitions:
• R := Δ ln det(hr¯s) (scalar curvature of U),
• Rr¯s dzr ∧d¯zs := −∂¯∂ln det(hr¯s) (Ricci form),
• γ :=
i
2π Rr¯s dzr ∧d¯z¯s (Chern form),
• [γ] ∈H2(U) (ﬁrst Chern class of U),

5.10 The Poincar´e Model of Hyperbolic Geometry
323
• υ := dz1 ∧d¯z1 ∧dz2 ∧d¯z2 ∧· · · ∧dzn ∧d¯zn (volume form of U).
Here, we set ∂:=
∂
∂zk dzk and ¯∂:=
∂
∂¯zk d¯zk. The operator
Δ := −(det(hr¯s))−1/2∂¯∂
is called the Laplace–Beltrami operator. For n = 1, the Gaussian curvature is given
by K = R/2.
Global K¨ahler manifold. Let M be a complex n-dimensional manifold
equipped with a smooth complex-valued 2-tensor ﬁeld h on M. Set
⟨v|w⟩P := hP (v, w)†
for all
v, w ∈TP M.
Then, M is called a K¨ahler manifold iﬀthe following hold:
• Each tangent space TP M becomes a complex Hilbert space equipped with the
inner product ⟨.|.⟩.
• Deﬁne κP (v, w) := ℑ(⟨v|w⟩P ) for all v, w ∈TP M.
• dκ = 0 on M.
In other words, h and κ look like (5.82) in local coordinates. The condition dκ = 0
guarantees that the equivalence class [κ] is an element of the second (de Rham)
cohomology group H2(M) of the K¨ahler manifold M.
5.10.2 K¨ahler–Einstein Geometry
A K¨ahler manifold M is called a K¨ahler–Einstein manifold iﬀthe Ricci form is
proportional to the K¨ahler form, that is there exists a complex constant λ such
that
Rj¯kdzj ∧d¯z
¯k = λhj¯kdzj ∧d¯z
¯k
on M.
These manifolds are related to Einstein’s equations for curved space-time manifolds
with vanishing external energy-matter ﬁeld. This models a universe where only
gravitation is acting (see (5.96) on page 330).
5.10.3 Symplectic Geometry
The real 2-dimensional manifold HR becomes a symplectic manifold equipped with
the symplectic form σ :=
1
y2 dx ∧dy. The map F : HR →HR is called a symplectic
isomorphism iﬀ
F ∗σ = σ
on HR.
Recall that, for a diﬀeomorpism F : R2 →R2 of the form
ξ = ξ(x, y),
η = η(x, y),
(x, y) ∈R2,
the linearization F ′(P) : R2 →R2 at the point P = (x, y) is given by the linear
map
 
α
β

=
 
ξx(x, y) ξy(x, y)
ηx(x, y) ηy(x, y)
!  
a

.

324
5. Geometrical Optics
The determinant of F ′(P) is called the Jacobian of F at the point P. Synonymously,
we will use the following symbols:
det F ′(P) =
˛˛˛˛˛
ξx(x, y) ξy(x, y)
ηx(x, y) ηy(x, y)
˛˛˛˛˛ = ∂(ξ(x, y), η(x, y))
∂(x, y)
.
Proposition 5.12 (i) The diﬀeomorphism F : R2 →R2 is a symplectic isomor-
phism with respect to the symplectic form dx∧dy iﬀF ′(P) ∈SL(2, R) for all points
P ∈R2, that is, F preserves both the Euclidean area measure and the orientation.
(ii) The diﬀeomorphism F : HR →HR is a symplectic isomorphism with respect
to the symplectic form σ iﬀ

η(x, y)2 · ∂(ξ(x, y), η(x, y))
∂(x, y)
= 1
y2
for all
(x, y) ∈H2
R,
that is, F preserves both the hyperbolic area measure and the orientation of the real
hyperbolic plane HR.
Explicitly, F ′(P) ∈SL(2, R) means that
∂(ξ(x,y),η(x,y))
∂(x,y)
= 1. Concerning (ii), for
any bounded open subset of U, we get

η2(x, y)
∂(ξ(x, y), η(x, y))

This tells us that
• the hyperbolic area measure meas(F(U)) of the transformed set F(U)
• equals the hyperbolic area measure meas(U) of the original set U.
Using the elegant language of diﬀerential forms, one brieﬂy writes

The proof of Prop. 5.12 will be given in Problem 5.3.
5.10.4 Riemannian Geometry
The doubts about what we may believe about the geometry of physical
space, raised by the work of Gauss, Lobachevsky and B´olayi, stimulated
one of the major creations of the 19th century, Riemannian geometry. The
creator was Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866) – the deepest philosopher of
geometry.48
Morris Kline, 1972
It was Riemann, who probably more than anyone else, enriched mathemat-
ics with new ideas. These ideas display an unusual degree of vitality and
impulse the whole of mathematics as well as many branches of physics.49

5.10 The Poincar´e Model of Hyperbolic Geometry
325
Hyperbolic straight lines (i.e., semi-circles centered at the x-axis or straight lines
parallel to the y-axis) are curved compared with Euclidean straight lines. Intuitively,
this is responsible for the nontrivial curvature of the real hyperbolic plane. The main
task of diﬀerential geometry is to measure this curvature of the manifold. This was
done by Gauss, Riemann, and ´Elie Cartan in diﬀerent settings.50
Metric properties of the real hyperbolic plane. For all points P of the
real hyperbolic plane HR and all tangent vectors v, w ∈HR, we set:
• gP := dx⊗dx+dy⊗dy
y2
(metric tensor of HR at the point P),
• ⟨v|w⟩P := gP (v, w) (inner product on the tangent space TP HR of the real hyper-
bolic plane at the point P),
• ||v|| :=
p
⟨v|v⟩P (length of the tangent vector v at the point P),
• υP := dx∧dy
y2
(volume form of HR at the point P).
These quantities can be used in order to introduce the following fundamental no-
tions for the real hyperbolic plane.
(i) Length l(C) of a smooth curve C: x = x(τ), y = y(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1 : We deﬁne
l(C) :=
Z τ1
τ0
||v(τ)|| dτ,
(5.84)
where v(τ) := ( ˙x(τ), ˙y(τ)) is the tangent vector of the curve C at the point P
corresponding to the curve parameter τ.
(ii) Angle α between two curves C and C∗at the intersection point P:
cos α :=
⟨v|v∗⟩P
||v||P · ||v∗||P .
(5.85)
Here, v (resp. v∗) are tangent vectors of the smooth curve C (resp. C∗) at the
intersection point P.
(iii) Area of an open bounded subset U of HR :
meas(U) :=
Z
U
υ.
(5.86)
This means that meas(U) =
R
U
dxdy
y2 .
Geodesics (generalized straight lines). For introducing curvature, our
starting point is the equation for geodesics. Set
v(τ) :=
 
˙x(τ)
˙y(τ)
!
.
By (5.57) on page 300, the equation for a geodesics x = x(τ), y = y(τ) can be
written as
50 Gauss (1777–1855), Betti (1823–1892), Riemann (1826–1866), Christoﬀel (1829–
1900), Ricci-Curbastro (1853–1925), Bianchi (1856–1928), ´Elie Cartan (1869–
1951), Levi-Civita (1873–1941), Einstein (1879–1955), Weyl (1885–1955), Ehres-
mann (1905–1979), Yang (born 1922).

A1 :=
 
ϱx ϱy
−ϱy ϱx
!
,
A2 :=
 
ϱy −ϱx
ϱx ϱy

.
Here, we set ϱ(x, y) := ln n(x, y).
Curvature properties of the real hyperbolic plane. In what follows we
will use the Einstein convention, that is, we will sum over equal upper and lower
indices from 1 to 2. We set x1 := x, x2 := y, and
∂j :=
∂
∂xj ,
j = 1, 2.
In Euclidean geometry, the equation for a geodesic (i.e., a straight line) reads as
dv(τ)
dτ
≡0. This motivates us to write the equation (5.87) of a geodesic on the
hyperbolic plane in the following form:
Dv(τ)
dτ
≡0
along γ = γ(τ).
(5.88)
To this end, we introduce the following notation:
• ∇i := ∂i + Ai (Ricci’s covariant partial derivative),
•
D
dτ := ˙xi(τ)∇i (covariant directional derivative),
• A := Aidxi (Cartan’s connection 1-form). In terms of Cartan’s connection 1-form
A, the equation (5.87) of geodesics reads as
˙v(τ) + Aγ(τ)( ˙γ(τ)) · v(τ) = 0,
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1.
(5.89)
Here, we write the curve C as γ(τ) := (x(τ), y(τ)), and we set v(τ) := ˙γ(τ).
• F := 1
2Fjk dxj ∧dxk (Cartan’s curvature 2-form). Here,
Fjk := ∇j∇k −∇k∇j,
j, k = 1, 2.
Using the Lie bracket [A, B]−:= AB −BA, we get the fundamental structural
equation
Fjk = ∂jAk −∂kAj + [Aj, Ak]−,
j, k = 1, 2.
Note that Fjk = −Fkj for j, k = 1, 2.
• RP (a, b, u, v) := −⟨F(a, b)u|v⟩P for all tangent vectors a, b, u, v ∈TP HR at the
point P (Riemann’s curvature tensor).51
51 Unfortunately, the deﬁnition of the Riemann curvature tensor is not unique in
the literature; there appear modiﬁed deﬁnitions based on permutations of the
arguments a, b, u, v. Our deﬁnition is chosen in such a way that the Gaussian
curvature and the scalar curvature have the same sign. Our terminology coincides
with the terminology used in the following two modern textbooks on Riemannian
geometry:
J. Jost, Riemannian Geometry and Geometric Analysis, 5th edition, Springer,
Berlin, 2008.
S. Novikov and T. Taimanov, Geometric Structures and Fields, Amer. Math.
Soc., Providence, Rhode Island.

5.10 The Poincar´e Model of Hyperbolic Geometry
327
The Riemann curvature tensor has the following symmetries for all arguments
a, b, u, v ∈THR and all points p ∈HR :
• RP (a, b, u, v) = −RP (b, a, u, v),
• RP (a, b, u, v) = −RP (a, b, v, u),
• RP (a, b, u, v) = RP (u, v, a, b).
That is, RP (a, b, u, v) is antisymmetric in the ﬁrst and second pairs of indices, and
it is symmetric relative to permutations of these pairs of indices.
Components. Introducing the notation for the matrix elements, we write
Ai = (Γ r
is) =
 
Γ 1
i1 Γ 1
i2
Γ 2

!
,
Fjk = (Rr
sjk) =

.
(5.90)
Here, r (resp. s) is the row (resp. column) index. For the inner product on the
tangent space TP HR, we have
⟨v|w⟩P = vigijwj
with gij(P) := n(P)2δij,and gij(P) := n(P)−2δij for i, j = 1, 2. Note that
gisgsj = δi
j
for all
i, j = 1, 2.
Here, we use the notation δi
j := δij (Kronecker symbol). That is, δ11 = δ22 = 1 and
δ12 = δ21 = 0. The equation (5.87) for the geodesics reads as
¨xk + ˙xiΓ k
ij ˙xj = 0,
k = 1, 2.
(5.91)
Finally, setting Rijkl := girRr
jkl, we get
RP (a, b, c, d) = −Rijkl(P) · aibjukvl.
Thus, the real numbers Rijkl(P) are the (negative) components of the Riemann
curvature tensor RP at the point P. Moreover, the real numbers Γ k
ij(P) are called
the Christoﬀel symbols at the point P. For a smooth real-valued function U on the
hyperbolic plane HR, the Laplacian looks like
ΔU = −gij∇i∇jU.
The Ricci tensor is deﬁned by
RicP (u, v) := ujRjlvl
for all
u, v ∈TP HR,
where Rjl := gikRijkl. Finally, the scalar curvature is deﬁned by
R(P) := gjlRjl(P).
Explicitly, we get F21 = −F12, F11 ≡F22 ≡0, and
F12 =
 
0
−ϱxx −ϱyy
ϱxx + ϱyy
0
!
.
Hence F = F12 dx1 ∧dx2. Using (5.72), an explicit computation shows that

328
5. Geometrical Optics
Rijkl = K(gikgjl −gjkgil),
i, j, k, l = 1, 2,
(5.92)
where K is the Gaussian curvature. Moreover,52
Rij = Kgij,
R = 2K.
This implies RicP = K(P)gP for all points P of HR. A real n-dimensional Rieman-
nian manifold M is called an Einstein manifold iﬀthere is a real constant λ such
that
RicP = λgP
for all
P ∈M.
Therefore, a real 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold is an Einstein manifold iﬀit
has constant Gaussian curvature (e.g., the 2-dimensional sphere and the hyperbolic
plane).53 By (5.92), from the symmetry relation gij = gji it follows that
• Rijkl = −Rjikl (antisymmetry with respect to i, j),
• Rijkl = −Rijlk (antisymmetry with respect to the ﬁrst pair of indices),
• Rijkl = −Rijlk (antisymmetry with respect to the second pair of indices),
• Rijkl = Rklij (symmetry between the ﬁrst pair and the second pair of indices),
• Ri[jkl] = 0 (the antisymmetrization with respect to the last three indices vanishes
– ﬁrst Bianchi identity). 54
• ∂[sRijk]l = 0 (antisymmetrization with respect to the ﬁrst three indices vanishes
identically – second Bianchi identity).
Hence R1212 = −R2112 = −R1221 = R2121. The remaining components Rijkl
vanish identically, since Riikl
= Rijkk
= 0. Therefore, only the component
R1212 = K(g11g22 −g12g21) is essential.55

with the ﬁxed end points (x1(τ0), x2(τ0)) and (x1(τ1), x2(τ1)). Every smooth so-
lution of this minimum problem satisﬁes the Euler–Lagrange equation (5.91) with
the Christoﬀel symbols56

Mnemonically, observe the position of the summation index s. In terms of matrix
elements, the fundamental structural equation

j, k = 1, 2
(5.93)
for the Cartan curvature 2-form F = 1
2Fijdxi ∧dxj reads as
52 Note that Rjl = Rijklgik = K(2gjl −δk
l gjk) = Kgjl.
53 We refer to A. Besse, Einstein Manifolds, Springer, New York, 1987.
54 Since Rijkl = −Rijlk, we get Ri[jkl] = 2(Rijkl + Riklj + Rikjl).
55 The situation completely changes in higher dimensions. Consider a real n-
dimensional Riemannian manifold, n = 2, 3, . . . Then, the Riemann curvature
tensor has n2(n2 −1)/12 essential components. In particular, if n = 4, then we
get 20 essential components. This is the case of Einstein’s theory of general rela-
tivity. As we will show in Vol. III, the scalar curvature R and its sign are crucial
for our universe, but not the 20 components of the Riemann curvature tensor.
56 We will prove this in Problem 5.7.

(5.95)
This is the theorema egregium of Gauss in terms of the Riemann curvature tensor.
This theorem tells us that the Gaussian curvature can be computed by knowing
the components gij of the metric tensor and their partial derivatives up to order 2.
These quantities can be intrinsically measured on the manifold without using any
embedding of the manifold into a higher-dimensional surrounding space.

ji, we get Θk = 0, i.e., the connection is torsion-free. For i, j = 1, 2,
it follows from (5.94) that
• Θi = ωi
s ∧dxs = 0 (torsion-free connection), and
• Ωi
j = dωi
j + ωi
s ∧ωs
j (structural equation).
Using ddω = 0 and the product rule d(ω ∧μ) = dω ∧μ −ω ∧dμ for 1-forms ω and
μ, we get the following:
• dΘi = dωi
s ∧dxs = 0 (ﬁrst Bianchi identity), and
• dΩj
i = dωi
s ∧ωs
j −ωi
s ∧dωs
j = 0 (second Bianchi identity).
This implies
• R[ijk]l = 0 (ﬁrst Bianchi identity), and
• ∂[sFkl] = 0 (second Bianchi identity).
One can show that this is equivalent to the second Bianchi identity given above.57 In
Vol. III we will use Cartan’s structural equations in order to compute elegantly the
Schwarzschild solution of the Einstein equations in general relativity. This solution
describes the gravitational ﬁeld of both the sun and black holes.
Killing the indices and the construction of invariants. The invariance
properties of the expressions above under changing local coordinates will be studied
in Vol. III based on a general approach. At this point let us only mention that the
theory will be designed in such a way that
Expressions without any free indices are invariants.
For example, A, F, R, Ric, R, and the Gaussian curvature K are invariants, that
is, they do not depend on the choice of the local coordinate system. Hence they
possess a geometric meaning.
We brieﬂy say that invariants are generated by killing the indices.
57 In the present 2-dimensional case, the argument is trivial. However, it can be
applied to higher dimensions. Then, the argument is crucial.

This is a special case of the index principle to be studied in Vol. III.
Symmetry. Recall that ϱ(x, y) := ln n(x, y), where n = n(x, y) is the refraction
index at the point. The equation (5.87) for the geodesics can be written as
¨xk + ( ˙x1, ˙x2)Γ k(P)
 
˙x1

k = 1, 2
with the symmetric matrices
Γ 1 := (Γ 1

ϱx ϱy
ϱy −ϱx
!
,
Γ 2 = (Γ 2
ij) =
 
−ϱy ϱx
ϱx ϱy
!
.
In addition, the matrices Γ 1, Γ 2 are traceless. Thus, they are contained in the Lie
algebra sl(2, R) of the symmetry group Sym(2, R) of the hyperbolic plane. This
means that the equations for the geodesics reﬂect the symmetry of the hyperbolic
plane on an inﬁnitesimal level.
Example 1 (Euclidean geometry). Let n ≡1. Then the covariant partial deriva-
tive (resp. the covariant directional derivative) coincides with the classical partial
derivative (resp. directional derivative), that is, ∇j = ∂j, j = 1, 2 and D
dτ =

dτ . The
Christoﬀel symbols vanish identically. Hence A, F, R ≡0, and K ≡0. That is, all
the curvature quantities vanish identically.
Example 2 (hyperbolic geometry). Let n(x, y) := 1
y for all x ∈R, y > 0. Hence
ϱ(x, y) = −ln y, and we have A = A1dx + A2dy with the connection matrices

For the metric tensor, we get

Hence R1212 = g1sRs

212 = −y−4. By the theorema egregium (5.95),
K ≡−1,

The Einstein equations in general relativity. These fundamental equations
read as
Ric(g) −1
2Rg + Λg = κT.
(5.96)
Here, g is the metric tensor of a 4-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian space-time man-
ifold with signature (1, −1, −1, −1). The Ricci tensor Ric(g) is responsible for grav-
itation in the universe. The geodesics describe the motion of both celestial bodies

and light rays.58 Here, κ := 8πG/c4 where G is Newton’s gravitational constant,
and c is the velocity of light in a vacuum. Moreover, Λ is the so-called cosmological
constant, which acts as a negative pressure if Λ > 0. This constant is responsible
for the accelerated expansion of our universe observed by astronomers. The energy-
momentum tensor T describes the distribution of matter and energy in the universe.
If T ≡0, then we get Ric(g) = ( 1
2R −Λ)g. If g is a solution of this equation, then
R = 4Λ. Hence
Ric(g) = Λg.
The Einstein equations will be studied in Vol. III. We refer to Zeidler (1986), Vol.
IV, and to Grøn and Hervik, Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity: with Modern
Applications in Cosmology, Springer, New York, 2007.
Historical remarks. In 1954, the young physicists Yang and Mills tried to
generalize the Maxwell equations. They used an idea of Hermann Weyl published
in 1929.59
• Weyl formulated the Maxwell equations as a gauge theory based on the commu-
tative Lie group U(1).
• The goal of Yang and Mills was to replace the commutative group U(1) by the
noncommutative Lie group SU(2).
To this end, they replaced the relation
Fjk = ∂jAk −∂kAj,
j = 1, 2, 3, 4
between the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor {Fij} and the 4-potential {Aj} by a mod-
iﬁed relation of the type
Fjk = ∂jAk −∂kAj + AjAk −AkAj,
j, k = 1, 2, 3, 4,
(5.98)
where the complex 2 × 2 matrices A1, A2, A3, A4 are elements of the Lie algebra
su(2) of the symmetry group SU(2). Dianzhou Zhang asked Professor Yang in
an interview:60 An interesting question is whether you understood in 1954 the
tremendous importance of your joint paper with Mills on noncommutative gauge
theory. Yang answered:
No. In the 1950s we felt our work was elegant. I realized its importance in
the 1960s and its great importance to physics in the 1970s. Its relationship
to deep mathematics became only clear to me after 1974.
In the 1960s and the early 1970s, equations of the type (5.98) above were used in
order to formulate the Standard Model in elementary particle physics. Here, the
symmetry group U(1) × SU(2) × SU(3) is used.
58 Using components, we have ds2 = gμνdxμdxν and
Rμν −1
2Rgμν + Λgμν = κTμν,
μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(5.97)
We sum over equal upper and lower indices from 0 to 3. Multiplying equation
(5.97) by gμν, we get R −2R + 4Λ = κgμνTμν. Hence R = 4Λ −κ tr(T).

• The crucial ﬁeld tensor {Fij} describes all the 12 particles (i.e., the photon, 8
gluons, and 3 vector bosons) which are responsible for the interaction
• between the 12 basic particles (i.e., 6 quarks and 6 leptons – the electron, 3
neutrinos, the muon, and the tau) and their antiparticles.
The typical diﬃculty of any gauge theory is the fact that the interacting particles
are massless at the very beginning. In contrast to this, the three vector bosons
observed in nature are quite heavy – their masses equal about 100 proton masses.
One needs an additional ﬁeld – the Higgs ﬁeld – in order to generate the masses
of the vector bosons. This so-called Higgs mechanism will be thoroughly studied in
Vol. III.
In the late 1960s, Yang discovered the relation between Yang–Mills theory and
Riemannian geometry. He reports in the same interview as quoted above:
In the late 1960s, I began a new formulation of gauge ﬁelds, through the
approach of non-integrable phase factors. It happend that one semester, I
was teaching general relativity, and I noticed that the formula (5.93) above
in gauge theory and the formula (5.94) above in Riemannian geometry
are not just similar – they are, in fact the same if one makes the right
identiﬁcation of symbols.
Yang continues:
With an appreciation of the geometrical meaning of gauge theory, I con-
sulted Jim Simons, a distinguished geometer, who was then the chairman
of the Mathematics Department at Stony Brook (Long Island, New York).
He said gauge theory must be related to connections on ﬁber bundles. I
then tried to understand ﬁber bundle theory from such books as Steen-
rod’s The Topology of Fiber Bundles, Princeton University Press, 1951,
but I learned nothing. The language of modern mathematics is too cold
and abstract for a physicist.61
In 1975, Wu and Yang wrote a paper about global gauge theory. In this paper, they
published a quite interesting dictionary about the completely diﬀerent terminology
of mathematicians and physicists concerning the same topic.62 For example:
connection in mathematics ⇔potential in physics,
curvature in mathematics ⇔ﬁeld tensor (interaction) in physics,
structural equation ⇔ﬁeld tensor −potential relation,
change of bundle coordinates ⇔gauge transformation,
structure group ⇔gauge group.63
In a long historical process, mathematicians tried to understand curvature, but
physicists studied the forces acting in the universe. Nowadays we know that mathe-
maticians and physicists did the same from an abstract mathematical point of view.

5.11 Ariadne’s Thread in Gauge Theory
333
The Cartan curvature 2-form is more fundamental than the Riemann cur-
vature tensor.
In fact, since RP (a, b, u, v) := −⟨F(a, b)u|v⟩P for all a, b, u, v ∈TP HR, the Riemann
curvature tensor only works if the tangent space of the manifold is equipped with the
additional structure of a Hilbert space (or an indeﬁnite Hilbert space, as in general
relativity). However, the notion of curvature in the sense of Cartan is independent of
such an additional structure. In terms of mathematics, the notion of curvature can
be introduced without using a metric, one only needs what is called a connection.
In terms of physics, this corresponds to the transport of information.
5.11 Ariadne’s Thread in Gauge Theory
The prototype of a gauge transformation in physics is given by the formula
ψ+(x, y, z, t) = eiα(x,y,z,t)ψ(x, y, z, t),
(x, y, z, t) ∈R4.
(5.99)
Here ψ : R4 →C is a complex-valued function depending on both Cartesian space
coordinates (x, y, z) ∈R3 and the time coordinate t ∈R. The real-valued phase
function α : R4 →R depends on space and time. The phase factor eiα is contained
in the group U(1) of all complex numbers ζ with |ζ| = 1. Linearization at the unit
element ζ = 1 of the group U(1) yields
eiα = 1 + iα + o(α),
α →0.
The purely imaginary numbers iα form the Lie algebra u(1) of the Lie group U(1).
From the physical point of view, suppose that the function ψ is a solution of the
Schr¨odinger equation for a quantum particle moving in R3, which satisﬁes the nor-
malization condition
R
R3 |ψ(x, y, z, t)|2 dxdydz = 1 for all times t ∈R. The real
number
pt(U) :=
Z
U
|ψ(x, y, z, t)|2 dxdydz
equals the probability of ﬁnding the quantum particle in the open subset U of R3
at time t. Observe the crucial fact that the probability pt(U) is invariant under the
gauge transformation (5.99). This follows from |eiα| = 1, and hence |ψ+(x, y, z, t)| =
|ψ(x, y, z, t)|.
In terms of physics, roughly speaking, gauge theory describes additional
internal degrees of freedom of physical systems which do not aﬀect the
physics.
For example, the choice of the potential does not inﬂuence the forces in classical
Newtonian mechanics.
From the mathematical point of view, gauge theory studies invariants under
gauge transformations.
Only such gauge invariants can be observed in physical experiments. Therefore,
gauge theory is part of the theory of invariants. In order to explain the basic ideas
of gauge theory, let us return to the hyperbolic plane HR.

5.11.1 Parallel Transport of Physical Information – the Key to
Modern Physics
In modern physics, the Huygens principle is replaced by the parallel trans-
port of physical information.64
Folklore
Again set x1 = x, x2 := y. Consider a smooth function ψ : HR →R2. We write
ψ(x1, x1) =
 
ψ1(x1, x2)
ψ2(x1, x2)
!
.
(5.100)
Intuitively, we regard ψ(x1, x2) as the value of a physical ﬁeld at the point (x1, x2)
of the hyperbolic plane HR. Let GL(2, R) denote the Lie group of all real invertible
(2 × 2)-matrices.
The equation of parallel transport. Let
C : x1 = x1(τ), x2 = x2(τ),
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1
be a smooth curve on the hyperbolic plane HR. Set γ(τ) := (x1(τ), x2(τ)). Further-
more, let ψ(τ) := ψ(γ(τ)). By deﬁnition, the ﬁeld ψ is parallel along the curve C
iﬀthe diﬀerential equation
˙ψ(τ) + ˙xi(τ)Ai(γ(τ)) · ψ(τ) = 0
(5.101)
is satisﬁed for all τ ∈[τ0, τ1]. This deﬁnition is motivated by (5.57) on page 300.65
In particular, as a consequence of our deﬁnition, the tangent vector ﬁeld
τ →( ˙x1(τ), ˙x2(τ))
of a geodesic C is parallel along the curve C itself. This generalizes the elementary
intuitive fact that, in Euclidean geometry, the tangent vector of a straight line C
is parallel along the straight line C itself. The operator Πτ of parallel transport is
deﬁned by
Πτψ0 := ψ(τ),
τ ≥0,
where τ →ψ(τ) is the unique solution of the diﬀerential equation (5.101) with the
initial condition ψ(τ0) := ψ0.
Parallel transport and covariant directional derivative. The following
theorem shows that the covariant directional derivative along the curve C is related
to parallel transport in a quite natural way.

Using (5.101), Taylor expansion at the point τ + σ yields
ψ∗(τ + σ) −ψ∗(τ) = −˙xi(τ + σ)Ai(x1(τ + σ), x2(τ + σ)) ψ∗(τ + σ) + o(σ),

Parallel transport and curvature. Consider the triangle T pictured in Fig.
5.24. The triangle is spanned by the vectors τa and τb with τ > 0. We are given
the ﬁeld ψ(P) at the point P in the hyperbolic plane HR. We carry out a clock-
wise parallel transport of the ﬁeld ψ(P) along the boundary ∂T = PABP of the
triangle T . We are starting at the initial point P and we are ﬁnishing at the ﬁnal
point P after turning once around the triangle. The result of this parallel transport
is denoted by Π∂T ψ(P). The following theorem tells us that, roughly speaking,
curvature measures the diﬀerence ψ(P) −Π∂T ψ(P). This means that
Curvature measures the path-dependence of the parallel transport.
In particular, if this diﬀerence vanishes, then also the curvature vanishes at the
point P. Let meas(T ) = 1
2 det(τa, τb) be the Euclidean area measure of the triangle
T . Now we contract the triangle T to the point P by letting τ →0.
Theorem 5.14 We have
FP (a, b)ψ(P) = det(a, b) lim

The proof based on the Poincar´e–Stokes integral theorem will be given in Prob-

Cartan’s covariant diﬀerential. For the physical ﬁeld ψ, the classical Cartan
calculus yields the following:

336
5. Geometrical Optics
• dψ = ∂kψ · dxk,
• d2ψ = d(∂jψ) ∧dxk = ∂j∂kψ · dxj ∧dxk ≡0 (Poincar´e identity).
Now we replace the partial derivative ∂k by the covariant partial derivative ∇k.
This way, we get the following deﬁnitions:
• Dψ := ∇kψ · dxk (covariant diﬀerential),
• D2ψ := D(∇kψ) ∧dxk = ∇j∇kψ · dxj ∧dxk,
• D3ψ := D(∇j∇kψ) ∧dxj ∧dxk = ∇i∇j∇kψ · dxi ∧dxj ∧dxk ≡0 (Bianchi
identity).
Let us discuss this. For any real linear space X, the space L(X, X) of linear operators
A : X →X becomes a real Lie algebra with respect to the Lie bracket [A, B] :=
AB −BA for all A, B ∈L(X, X). In particular, by cyclic permutation, we have the
Jacobi identity
[ [A, B], C] + [ [B, C], A] + [ [C, A], B] = 0.
Explicitly, (AB −BA)C −C(AB −BA) + (BC −CB)A −A(BC −CB) + (CA −
AC)B −B(CA −AC) = 0. Now we apply this to the covariant partial diﬀerential
operator ∇k. Hence
“
[ [∇i, ∇j], ∇k] + [ [∇j, ∇k], ∇i] + [ [∇k, ∇i], ∇j]
”
ψ = 0.
(5.103)
Since dxj ∧dxj = −dxk ∧dxj, we get
D2ψ = 1
2(∇j∇k −∇k∇l)ψ · dxj ∧dxk = 1
2[∇j, ∇k] ψ · dxj ∧dxk.
Therefore, we have the structural equation66
Fψ = D2ψ,
where Fψ = 1
2Fjkψ · dxj ∧dxk with
Fjkψ = [∇j, ∇k]ψ,
j, k = 1, 2.
This tells us that the Cartan curvature 2-form measures the structure of the Lie
algebra generated by the covariant partial derivatives. From (5.103) we obtain the
Bianchi identity D3ψ = 0, which is equivalent to the relation
∇[rFkl] = 0.
(5.104)
This means that antisymmetrization with respect to the indices r, k, l always van-
ishes identically.67 Alternatively, Dψ, D2ψ, and D3ψ = 0 can be written as follows:
• Dψ = dψ + Aψ (covariante diﬀerential),
• F = dA + A ∧A (structural equation),
• dF + A ∧F −F ∧A = 0 (Bianchi identity).
For a detailed discussion, we refer to Vol. III. There we will also show that the ve-
locity vector ﬁelds on a manifold form a Lie algebra generated by the Lie derivative,
and that there exists a close relation between this Lie algebra and curvature.
66 Mnemonically, we write F = D2.
67 For 2-dimensional manifolds, the Bianchi identity is trivial, since 3-forms vanish
identically on a 2-dimensional manifold. However, the argument above also ap-
plies to n-dimensional manifolds, n = 3, 4, . . . Then we we get nontrivial results
(see Vol. III).

5.11.2 The Phase Equation and Fiber Bundles
In a natural way, the global mathematical description of physical ﬁelds is
based on the language of bundles.
Folklore
The main trick due to ´Elie Cartan is to reduce the parallel transport of a physical
ﬁeld to a dynamical system in a principal ﬁber bundle (Cartan’s method of moving
frame).68 To this end, we will replace the diﬀerential equation of parallel transport
by the phase equation (5.106) below. First let us introduce some bundles.
Tangent bundle. By deﬁnition, the tangent bundle THR of the hyperbolic
plane HR consists of all the pairs (P, v), where P is a point of the hyperbolic plane,
and v is a tangent vector at the point P. That is,
THR := {(P, v) : P ∈HR, v ∈TP HR}.
This is a real 4-dimensional manifold.
Cotangent bundle. By deﬁnition, the cotangent space T ∗
P HR of the hyperbolic
plane at the point P is the dual space to the tangent space TP HR. That is, the
elements of T ∗
P HR are linear functionals of the form ω : TP HR →R.
Principal ﬁber bundle. The product set
P := HR × GL(2, R) = {(P, G) : P ∈HR, G ∈GL(2, R)}
is called the (trivial) principal ﬁber bundle over HR with the group GL(2, R) as
typical ﬁber.
The fundamental phase equation. Let C : P = P(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1 be
a smooth curve on the hyperbolic plane. Here, the point P corresponds to the
coordinates (x1, x2). The main idea is to replace the diﬀerential equation
˙ψ(τ) + ˙xi(τ)Ai(P(τ)) · ψ(τ) = 0,
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1,
ψ(τ0) = ψ0
(5.105)
of parallel transport along the curve by the phase equation
˙G(τ) + ˙xi(τ)Ai(P(τ)) G(τ) = 0,
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1
(5.106)
along the curve C.
Proposition 5.15 If G = G(τ) is a smooth solution of the phase equation (5.106),
then the function
ψ(τ) := G(τ)ψ0,
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1
is a solution of the equation (5.105) of parallel transport.
The proof follows by diﬀerentiation. This way the parallel transport along the
curve C corresponds to a curve
(P, G) = (P(τ), G(τ)),
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1
on the principal ﬁber bundle P.
Associated vector bundle. The (trivial) bundle
V := {(P, ψ) : P ∈HR, ψ ∈R2}
is called the associated vector bundle to the principal ﬁber bundle P with the
typical ﬁber R2. The parallel transport ψ = ψ(τ) of the physical ﬁeld corresponds
to the curve
(P, ψ) = (P(τ), ψ(τ)),
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1
in the vector bundle V.
68 The intuitive background will be studied in Vol. III.

5.11.3 Gauge Transformations and Gauge-Invariant Diﬀerential
Forms
Gauge transformations. Let P denote a point in the hyperbolic plane HR with
the coordinates (x1, x1). The transformation
ψ+(P) = G(P)ψ(P)
(5.107)
is called a gauge transformation. More precisely, we assume that the transformation
matrix G(P) is contained in the group GL(2, R) for all points P in HR and that the
map G : HR →GL(2, R) is smooth. We add the transformation law
(P, G) →(P, G+)
G+ = G(P)G
for the coordinates of the principal ﬁber bundle P = HR × GL(2, R). The standard
example of the gauge transformation of a velocity ﬁeld will be investigated below.
We postulate:
Parallel transport is compatible with gauge transformations.
In order to reach this goal, we introduce the following transformed quantities for
all i, j = 1, 2 :
• A+
j := GAjG−1 −G−1∂jG (connection matrices),69
• ∇+
j := ∂j + A+
j (covariant partial derivative),
•
D+
dτ :=
d
dτ + ˙xiA+
i (covariant directional derivative),
• A+ = A+
i dxi (connection 1-form),
• F +
ij := ∇+
i ∇+
j −∇+
j ∇+
i (curvature matrices),
• F + := 1
2F +
ij dxi ∧dxj (curvature 2-form).
Theorem 5.16 If τ →ψ(τ) is parallel along the curve C, then so is ψ+ with
respect to the transformed connection matrices.
Proof. From I = GG−1, we get 0 = ∂j(GG−1) = ∂jG · G−1 + G∂j(G−1). Hence
∂jG · G−1 = −G∂j(G−1) = G · G−2∂jG = G−1∂jG.
Therefore,
A+
j = GAjG−1 −∂jG · G−1.
(5.108)
Diﬀerentiating ψ+(τ) = G(P(τ)) · ψ(τ) with respect to the curve parameter τ, we
get
˙ψ+ = ( ˙xi∂iG)ψ + G ˙ψ.
Substituting ψ = G−1ψ+ and ˙ψ = −˙xiAiψ, we obtain ˙ψ+ + ˙xiA+
i ψ+ = 0.

We have the following transformation laws:

P = G(P)AP G(P)−1,
• F +
ij(P) = G(P)Fij(P)G(P)−1,
• F +
P = G(P)FP G(P)−1.
This shows the crucial fact that:
Both the covariant partial derivative and the covariant directional deriva-
tive are transformed like the physical ﬁeld ψ itself.
For the covariant partial derivative, by (5.108), this follows from
∇+
j ψ+ = ∇+
j (Gψ) = ∂j(Gψ) + A+
j (Gψ)
= ∂jG · ψ + G∂jψ + GAjψ −∂jG · ψ = G(∂j + Aj)ψ = G∇jψ.
A similar argument yields the transformation law for the covariant directional
derivative. For the curvature components Fij, observe that

The Maurer–Cartan form. Let us consider the principal ﬁber bundle P :=
HR × GL(2, R). The 1-form
M(P,G) := G−1dG
for all
(P, G) ∈P
is called the Maurer–Cartan form on P.70 Explicitly, M(P,G) = G−1∂jG dxj. Con-
sider a smooth curve C : xj = xj(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, j = 1, 2, on the base manifold
HR. Deﬁne G(τ) := G(x1(τ), x2(τ)). Then ˙G(τ) = ˙xj(τ)∂jG(P(τ)). Hence, for all
τ ∈[τ0, τ1],
M(P (τ),G(τ))( ˙P(τ), ˙G(τ)) = G(τ)−1 ˙xj(τ)∂jG(P(τ)) = G−1(τ) ˙G(τ).
Fix G ∈GL(2, R), and set fG(P, G) := (P, GG) for all (P, G) ∈P.
Proposition 5.17 For any G ∈GL(2, R), the Maurer–Cartan form M is invariant
under the gauge transformation fG : P →P.
Proof. We have to show that f ∗
GM = M. In fact, the linearization
f ′
G(P, G) : T(P,G)P →T(P,GG)P
is given by f ′
G(v, V ) = (v, GV ) for all (v, V ) ∈TP HR × TGGL(2, R).71 Hence
(f ∗
GM)G(v, V ) = M(P,GG)(v, GV ) = (GG)−1GV = G−1V = MG(v, V ).

Proposition 5.18 dM + M ∧M = 0 on P.
70 Maurer (1859–1927) worked on the theory of invariants at the University of
T¨ubingen (Germany).
71 To see this, note that diﬀerentiation of H(τ) := GG(τ) yields ˙H(0) = G ˙G(0).

5. Geometrical Optics
This is called the Maurer–Cartan structural equation of the Lie group GL(2, R).
As we will show in Vol. III, intuitively, this equation tells us that the curvature of
the Lie group GL(2, R) (with respect to left-translation on the group) vanishes
identically, and M is the corresponding connection 1-form. This is true for all Lie
groups.
Proof. It follows from GG−1 = I that dG · G−1 + GdG−1 = 0. Hence
d(G−1dG) = dG−1 ∧dG = (dG−1)G ∧G−1dG = −G−1dG ∧G−1dG.

Gauge-invariant diﬀerential forms. For any point (P, G) of the principal
ﬁber bundle P = HR × GL(2, R), we deﬁne:
• A(P,G) := G−1dG + G−1AP G (global connection 1-form on P).
Proposition 5.19 The global connection form A on the principal ﬁber bundle P is
invariant under the gauge transformation (P, G) →(P, G+). Explicitly, this means
that, A+
(P,G+) = A(P,G).
Proof. By Prop. 5.17, G−1
+ dG+ = G−1dG. Hence
A+
(P,G+) = G−1
+ dG+ + G−1
+ A+
P G+
= G−1dG + (GG)−1GAP G−1(GG) = G−1dG + G−1AP G = A(P,G).

The global phase equation. Using the global connection 1-form A, the equa-
tion
A(P (τ),G(τ))( ˙P(τ), ˙G(τ)) = 0,
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1
(5.109)
is equivalent to the phase equation (5.106). In fact, equation (5.109) means that
G(τ)−1 ˙G(τ) + G(τ)−1AP (τ)( ˙P(τ))G(τ) = 0. This is equivalent to
˙G(τ) + AP (τ)( ˙P(τ))G(τ) = 0.
Explicitly, ˙G(τ) + ˙xj(τ)Aj(P(τ))G(τ) = 0.
Cartan’s global structural equation. We deﬁne the global curvature form
F on the principal ﬁber bundle P = HR × GL(2, R) by setting
F := dA + A ∧A.
(5.110)
Sections of the principal ﬁber bundle and gauge transformations. Let
s : HR →P be a section of the principal ﬁber bundle P := HR × GL(2, R). By
deﬁnition, this is a smooth map of the form
s(P) := (P, G(P))
for all
P ∈HR.
In Vol. III, we will develop a calculus for diﬀerential forms on principal ﬁber bundles
with values in a Lie algebra. In this setting, we will show in Vol. III that
s∗F = F +.
Explicitly, (s∗F)P = G−1
+ (P)FP G+ where G+(P) = G(P)G. Thus, the pull-back
s∗F of the global curvature form F is precisely the gauge transformation of the
Cartan curvature 2-form F. Similarly, the pull-back s∗A of the global connection
1-form A yields the gauge-transformation of the phase equation which implies the
equation of parallel transport for physical ﬁelds. Summarizing, we get the following:

5.11 Ariadne’s Thread in Gauge Theory
341
The global curvature form F (deﬁned on the principal ﬁber bundle P =
HR × GL(2, R) with values in the Lie algebra gl(2, R)) represents an in-
variant mathematical object which carries all the information on the gauge
transformations of the Cartan curvature 2-form on the base manifold HR.
Standard example (velocity ﬁelds). Let
xj
+ = χj(x1, x2),
j = 1, 2
(5.111)
be a diﬀeomorphism from the hyperbolic plane HR onto itself. This represents a
change of coordinates on the hyperbolic plane. Regard the parameter τ as time. In
terms of physics, the curve
C :
xi = xi(τ),
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, i = 1, 2
describes the motion of a point on the hyperbolic plane with the velocity vector
v(τ) :=
 
˙x1(τ)
˙x2(τ)
!
at time τ. After the coordinate change (5.111), the curve looks like
C : xi
+(τ) = χi(x1(τ), x2(τ)),
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, i = 1, 2.
Diﬀerentiation with respect to time yields the transformation law of the velocities:
 
˙x1
+(τ)
˙x2
+(τ)
!
=
 
∂1χ1(P(τ))
∂2χ1(P(τ))
∂1χ2(P(τ))
∂2χ2(P(τ))
!  
˙x1(τ)
˙x2(τ)
!
.
This is a gauge transformation of the form v+ = G(P(τ)) v. Observe that, in this
example, a change of coordinates generates a transformation law for the velocity
vectors in the tangent space, which represents a gauge transformation.72
5.11.4 Perspectives
The approach above was chosen in order to display the historical development from
Gauss’ theorema egregium to Cartan’s structural equation. In modern diﬀerential
geometry, the axiomatic presentation reverses the historical order.
• The starting point is the fundamental phase equation, as a diﬀerential equation
on a principal ﬁber bundle P.
• More precisely, one starts with a velocity ﬁeld on P which splits into horizontal
and vertical velocity vectors, with respect to the ﬁbers.
• This velocity vector ﬁeld generates the dynamical system of parallel transport.
The corresponding ordinary diﬀerential equation coincides with the equation of
parallel transport, which is based on the connection 1-form A on P.
• Projection onto horizontal vector ﬁelds is used in order to replace the diﬀerential
dω by the covariant diﬀerential Dω of diﬀerential forms ω on the principal ﬁber
bundle P.
72 The relation to the classical tensor calculus will be studied in Vol. III. We refer
to J. Schouten, Ricci Calculus, Springer, Berlin, 1954.

• This yields the curvature form
F := DA,
(5.112)
and the Bianchi identity DF = 0. It turns out that (5.112) is equivalent to
Cartan’s structural equation (5.110).
The extremely elegant formula (5.112) generalizes both the theorema egregium
of Gauss and the relation between the electromagnetic ﬁeld tensor F and the 4-
potential A in Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism. Moreover, formula (5.112) lies
at the heart of both the Standard Model in elementary physics and Einstein’s theory
of general relativity. In terms of mathematics, this approach eﬀectively describes
all kinds of diﬀerential geometries:
• The typical Lie group of the principal ﬁber bundle P is the symmetry group of
the geometry under consideration.
• Physicists are interested in the study of partial diﬀerential equations for physical
ﬁelds. In this general setting, physical ﬁelds ψ are sections of a vector bundle V
associated to the principal ﬁber bundle P.
• There exists a natural way of transplanting the parallel transport from P to V.
• The parallel transport on V generates the corresponding covariant diﬀerentiation
for physical ﬁelds, which is used in order to formulate the basic partial diﬀerential
equations for the physical ﬁeld under consideration.
The point is that one has to replace product bundles by general ﬁber bundles.
Observe that:
General ﬁber bundles are obtained by gluing local product bundles together,
with the aid of a cocycle.
In particular, the choice of arbitrary Lie groups allows us to take all kind of sym-
metries into account. In 1872 Felix Klein (1849–1925) formulated his Erlangen
program:
Geometry is the invariant theory of transformation groups (symmetry
groups).
Sophus Lie (1842–1899), ´Elie Cartan (1859–1951), and their successors realized
this program in diﬀerential geometry by investigating Lie groups and the invariant
calculus of diﬀerential forms. This is a fascinating chapter in the history of math-
ematics and physics. We will thoroughly study this in Vol. III. We also refer to
the standard textbook by S. Kobayashi and K. Nomizu, Foundations of Diﬀerential
Geometry, Vols. 1, 2, Wiley, New York, 1963.

5.12 Classiﬁcation of Two-Dimensional Compact
Manifolds
The notion of manifold is of fundamental importance for both mathematics
and physics. There arises the problem of classifying manifolds in terms
of topology. This has been one of the most important research topics in
topology in the last 150 years.
Folklore
In 1863 M¨obius classiﬁed the compact orientable 2-manifolds.73 Some examples
are pictured in Fig. 5.25.74 In 1865 M¨obius published a strange surface called the
M¨obius strip nowadays. This twisted surface is obtained from a rectangle by gluing
together two opposite sides in a twisted manner (Fig. 5.26). If we walk along this
surface, then we reach both sides of the rectangle. Therefore, the M¨obius strip is a
one-sided surface, and hence it is not possible to deﬁne an orientation. Intuitively,
a surface is oriented iﬀthe movement of a small oriented circle along a closed
curve never changes the orientation of the circle. The main theorem on classical
topological surface theory reads as follows:75
The compact 2-manifolds M and N (without or with boundary) are home-
omorphic iﬀthe following three conditions hold:
(i) M and N have the same genus g,
(ii) M and N have the same number of boundaries, and
(iii) both M and N are either orientable or non-orientable.
The genus attains the values g = 0, 1, 2, . . . Let us ﬁrst consider a few typical
examples. Recall that the Euler characteristic of the 2-manifold M is given by
χ(M) = β0 −β1 + β2,
73 M¨obius (1790–1868) was director of the observatory in Leipzig from 1820 until
his death. Gauss recommended him for this position.
74 Let n = 1, 2, . . . By deﬁnition, an n-manifold is a real n-dimensional arcwise
connected manifold without boundary. Similarly, an n-manifold with boundary
is a real n-dimensional arcwise connected manifold with boundary (see Sects. 5.4
and 10.4.2 of Vol. I). An n-dimensional sphere Sn
r of radius r > 0 is described by
the equation x2
1 + . . . + x2
n+1 = r2 in Rn+1. The Betti numbers of an n-sphere
are given by β0 = βn = 1 and βk = 0 if k = 1, 2, . . . , n −1. This yields the Euler
characteristic χ(Sn
r ) = Pn
k=0(−1)kβk = 1 + (−1)n.
75 In 1907 the ﬁrst complete proof of this theorem was given by M. Dehn and
P. Heegard, Analysis Situs (Topology), Enzyklop¨adie der mathematischen Wis-
senschaften, Vol. III, Nr. 3, pp. 153–220, Teubner, Leipzig, 1907 (in German).
We refer to the classic textbooks by Levi (1929) and Rinow (1975), Sect. XII.2,
and to the nicely written textbook by Kinsey (1993).

Fig. 5.27. The torus T2
where β0, β1, β2 are the Betti numbers of M. Since the 2-manifold M is arcwise
connected, we always have β0 = 1. Moreover, we have β2 = 1 (resp. β2 = 0) iﬀM
is orientable (resp. non-orientable).
• The 2-sphere S2
r of radius r > 0 : This surface has the genus g = 0, the Betti
numbers
β0 = β2 = 1, β1 = 0
and the Euler characteristic χ(S2
r) = 2. The fundamental group is trivial,
π1(S2
r) = 0, that is, the sphere S2
r is simply connected.
• The 2-dimensional torus T2 : This surface can be obtained by identifying the
opposite boundary points of a rectangle (Fig. 5.27). Alternatively, the torus is
homeomorphic to a sphere with one handle attached to it (Fig. 5.25(a)). This
surface has the genus g = 1, the Betti numbers
β0 = β2 = 2, β1 = 2,
and the Euler characteristic χ(T2) = 0. For the additive fundamental group, we
get
π1(T2) = Z ⊕Z.
This reﬂects the fact that there exist two diﬀerent types of closed curves on the
torus which cannot be contracted to one point. For example, in Fig. 5.27(c) this
concerns the equator ABA and the meridian circle PAP. Consequently, the torus
T2 is not simply connected.
• The real 2-dimensional projective space P2 : This space is obtained from the
closed unit disc by identifying diametrically opposed boundary points of the unit
disc with each other (Fig. 5.28). The topological space P2 is compact, arcwise
connected, non-orientable, and it has the Betti numbers
β0 = 1, β1 = β2 = 0.
This yields the Euler characteristic χ(P2) = 1. The genus of P2 is given by g = 1,
as we will discuss below. The additive fundamental group of P2 is given by

π1(P2) = Z2.
This group consists of the two elements {0, 1} with 1+1 = 0. The element ”1” of
π1(P2) corresponds to the boundary curve PQP (Fig. 5.28). This curve cannot be
continuously contracted to a point within P2. Thus, the projective space P2 is not
simply connected. In contrast to this, taking the identiﬁcation of diametrically
opposed boundary points into account, the curve PQPQP can be continuously
contracted to the center of the unit disc. This corresponds to ”1+1=0.”
Let us now study the general case. We are given the compact 2-manifold M
of genus g. Let r = 0, 1, 2, . . . be the number of boundaries. Then there exists a
manifold N which is homeomorphic to M and which represents one of the following
normal forms:76
(I) Suppose that M is orientable.
(I-1) Let r = 0. Then the normal form N is obtained from the unit sphere S2 by
taking 2g open discs away and by attaching g handles. The genus is also equal
to the number of ‘holes’ (Fig. 5.25).
• Betti numbers of M: β0 = β2 = 1, β1 = 2g.
• Euler characteristic of M: χ = 2 −2g.
• Additive fundamental group of M: π1 = Z ⊕. . . ⊕Z (2g summands).
(I-2) Let r > 0. The normal form N is obtained from (I-1) by taking r open discs
away (Fig. 5.29).
• Betti numbers of M: β0 = β2 = 1 and β1 = 2g + r −1.
• Euler characteristic of M : χ = 3 −2g −r.
(II) Suppose that M is non-orientable.
(II-1) Let r = 0. The normal form N is obtained from the unit sphere S2 by taking
g open discs away, and by identifying diametral points of the boundary circles
with each other. The number g is the genus of M. For example, the surface
pictured in Fig. 5.30(a) is homeomorphic to the projective space P2.
• Betti numbers of M: β0 = 1, β1 = g −1, β2 = 0. Here, g = 1, 2, . . .
• Euler characteristic of M: χ = 2 −g.
(II-2) Let r > 0. The normal form is obtained from (II-1) by taking r open discs
away. Again the number g is called the genus of M.
• Betti numbers of M: β1 = 1, β1 = g + r −1, β2 = 0.
• Euler characteristic of M: χ = 2 −g −r.
In particular, the M¨obius strip corresponds to g = 1 and r = 1. Hence β1 = 1
and χ = 0.
76 Note that the Betti numbers, the Euler characteristic, and the fundamental
groups of M and N coincide.

5.13 The Poincar´e Conjecture and the Ricci Flow
The study of mathematics, like the Nil, begins in minuteness, but ends in
magniﬁcence.
C.C. Colton, 1820
Friedman’s 1982 proof of the 4-dimensional Poincar´e hypothesis was an
extraordinary tour de force. His methods were so sharp that as to actually
provide a complete classiﬁcation of all compact simply connected topo-
logical 4-manifolds, yielding many previously unknown examples of such
manifolds.77
John Milnor, 1986
The Poincar´e conjecture for 3-manifolds was one of the seven Millenium Prize Prob-
lems announced by the Clay Mathematics Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
in the year 2000 (see Sect. 1.7 of Vol. I).
The topological characterization of the 2-sphere. The following result
was already known in the second half of the 19th century:
A compact simply connected 2-manifold is homeomorphic to
a 2-sphere.
This homeomorphism can be chosen as a diﬀeomorphism.
The topological characterization of the 3-sphere. The famous Poincar´e
conjecture claims the following:
A compact simply connected 3-manifold is diﬀeomorphic to
a 3-sphere.
This conjecture was proven by Grigori Perelman (born 1966) in 2003. He invented
an ingenious approach for solving this outstanding problem. The main idea comes
from physics. Here, Perelman uses the physical picture of the ﬂow of ﬂuid particles
in order to deform the original 3-manifold into the ﬁnal 3-sphere. More precisely,
he applies the so-called Ricci ﬂow on manifolds which was thoroughly studied in
the pioneering papers by Richard Hamilton in the 1980s and 1990s. The Ricci ﬂow
is governed by the partial diﬀerential equation
∂g(t)
∂t
= −2Ric(g(t)),
t ≥0.
(5.113)
Here, the parameter t can be regarded as time. This equation describes the time-
deformation of the metric tensor g of a Riemannian manifold M. Equation (5.113)

is of the type of a diﬀusion process (or heat conduction process). The main diﬃculty
is that there may appear singularities during the time evolution. One has to control
the possible types of singularities, and one has to regularize and renormalize them
(see the hints for further reading on page 351).
The generalization of the idea of the ﬂow of ﬂuid particles is also crucial for
quantum physics. In Sect. 7.11.5 we will show that the Feynman path integral
corresponds to a diﬀusion process in imaginary time (the Feynman–Kac formula).
Moreover, the modern approach to renormalization in quantum ﬁeld theory is based
on the ﬂow generated by the renormalization group (see Chap. 3 of Vol. I).
The homotopy type of a topological space. Recall from Vol. I the following
terminology. Let X and Y be topological spaces. Let idX denote the identity map
on X. The two continuous maps f, g : X →X are called homotopic iﬀthere exists
a continuous map H : X × [0, 1] →X such that
H(x, 0) = f(x)
and
H(x, 1) = g(x)
for all
x ∈X.
We write f ∼g. The map H is called a homotopy.
By deﬁnition, the space X has the same homotopy type as the space Y iﬀthere
exist continuous maps F : X →Y and G : Y →X such that
GF ∼idX
and
FG ∼idY .
That is, the composite maps GF : X →X and FG : Y →Y are homotopic to the
corresponding identity maps. We also say that the space X is homotopy equivalent
to the space Y . For example, a topological space is called contractible iﬀit has the
same homotopy type as a single point (see Sect. 5.5 of Vol. I)..
By deﬁnition, the topological space X has the same topological type as the
topological space Y iﬀX is homeomorphic to Y . Explicitly, this means that there
exists a bijective continuous map F : X →Y such that the inverse map F −1 : Y →
X is also continuous. Setting G := F −1, we get GF = idX and FG = idY. Thus, if
X and Y have the same topological type, then they also have the same homotopy
type. However, the converse is not always true.
The topological characterization of the n-sphere. The generalized Poin-
car´e conjecture reads as follows:
If an n-manifold has the same homotopy type as an n-sphere, then it has
actually the same topological type as an n-sphere.
Nowadays we know that this statement is true for all dimensions n = 1, 2, . . .
For n ≥5, the proof was given by Smale, and independently by Stallings and
Zeeman and by Wallace in 1960-61. For n = 4, Freedman gave the proof in 1982.
Perelman settled the most diﬃcult case n = 3 in 2002. For their seminal results,
Smale, Freedman and Perelman were awarded the Fields medal in 1966, 1986, and
2006, respectively. Perelman refused the award. Another formulation of the Poincar´e
conjecture reads as follows:
If an n-manifold has the same fundamental group and the same
homology as the n-sphere, then it is actually homeomorphic to the
n-sphere.78
This is true for all dimensions n = 1, 2, . . . The positive answer to the Poincar´e
conjecture tells us the following highly nontrivial result:
Algebraic topology is able to detect spheres in all dimensions.
78 By deﬁnition, two topological spaces X and Y have the same homology iﬀthey
have the same homology groups with integer coeﬃcients. For an n-sphere, these
homology groups are given by H0 = Hn = Z and Hk = 0 if k = 1, 2, . . . , n −1
(see Vol. IV).

5.14 A Glance at Modern Optimization Theory
In the 1950s, modern control theory was founded by generalizing the duality be-
tween wave fronts and light rays.
(i) Dynamic programming (generalized wave fronts): Bellman created dynamic pro-
gramming by generalizing the Hamilton–Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation to
the Bellman functional equation. In geometrical optics, the eikonal function S
measures the time needed for the propagation of light. In dynamic program-
ming, the function S measures the quantity to be optimized (e.g., the costs of
a production process).
(ii) Pontryagin’s maximum principle (generalized light rays): Pontryagin general-
ized the Hamilton canonical equations for light rays (and the maximum princi-
ple in geometrical optics) to the computation of optimal trajectories in modern
technology. Let us discuss some important examples.
• For the return of a spaceship from moon to earth, one has to compute a
trajectory such that the heating of the spaceship remains minimal. Of in-
terest in the optimal solution is the fact that the spaceship penetrates the
earth’s atmosphere rather deeply (from 120 km altitude to 50 km) and then
it climbs again to the altitude of 75 km. On the other hand, the velocity falls
almost monotonically. The computation (performed by Roland Bulirsch for
the NASA in the 1960s) can be found in Stoer and Bulirsch, Introduction
to Numerical Analysis, Springer, New York, 1993.
• For the moon landing, one needs a feed-back control program which guaran-
tees minimal fuel consumption of the moon landing ferry. Here, the braking
process is controlled by measuring the distance between the ferry and the
moon surface.
• For the ﬂight to Mars, one needs a trajectory of the spaceship which again
guarantees minimal fuel consumption, by taking the gravitational forces of
the planets in our solar system into account.
The proof for the validity of Pontryagin’s maximum principle is highly sophisti-
cated. For a detailed study of (i) and (ii) in the setting of nonlinear functional
analysis, we refer to Zeidler (1986), Vol. III, quoted on page 353.

5.1 Leibniz’s product rule for diﬀerentials. Let x, h ∈Rn with n = 1, 2, . . . We
write x := (x1, . . . , xn) and h = (h1, . . . , hn). Choose i = 1, . . . n. The basic
deﬁnition is given by
dxi(h) = hi,
h ∈Rn.
(5.114)
This means that dxi is a linear functional on Rn. For each smooth function
f : Rn →R, we deﬁne80
df(x) := ∂f(x)
∂xi
dxi.
(5.115)
We sum over i = 1, . . . n. Explicitly, we get the linear functional df(x) : Rn →R
with
dfx(h) = ∂f(x)
∂xi
dxi(h) = ∂f(x)
∂xi
hi.
Prove that, for given smooth functions f, g : Rn →R, we have the Leibniz
product rule
d(fg) = (df)g + f(dg).
(5.116)
Solution: d(fg) = (fg)xidxi = fxigdxi + fgxidxi.
80 To streamline notation, we sometimes write dfx instead of df(x).

5.2 Leibniz’s chain rule and the pull-back of diﬀerentials. To the diﬀerential
df = ∂f
∂xi dxi
we want to apply the transformation formula xi = xi(u1, . . . , um), i = 1, . . . , n.
(i) Elegant formal argument due to Leibniz: It follows from dxi =
∂xi
∂uj duj
that
df = ∂f
∂xi
∂xi
∂uj duj.
(5.117)
We sum over i = 1, . . . , n and j = 1, . . . , m. This corresponds to the chain
rule
∂f
∂uj = ∂f
∂xi
∂xi
∂uj ,
j = 1, . . . , m
where we sum over i = 1, . . . , n.
(ii) Rigorous argument: We write xi = F i(u1, . . . , um), and we deﬁne the pull-
back F ∗df of the functional df by setting
F ∗df := df ◦F ′.
(5.118)
This means that we use the linearized map F ′(u) : Rn →Rn in order to
transform the linear functional df into the linear functional F ∗df. Explic-
itly, this means that
(F ∗df)u(k) = dfx(F ′(u)k)
for all
k ∈Rm,
where x = F(u). Show that (ii) corresponds to (i) because of the quite
natural relation
F ∗(df) = d(f ◦F).
(5.119)
between the diﬀerential d(f ◦F) of the transformed function f ◦F and the
pull-back F ∗df of the original diﬀerential df.
Solution: Set h := F ′(u)k. Then
hi = ∂F i(u)
∂uj
kj,
i = 1, . . . , n
where we sum over j = 1, . . . , m. Then
dfx(F ′(u)k) = ∂f(x)
∂xi
∂F i(u)
∂uj
kj
where x = x(u). Set g := f ◦F. Then g(u) = f(F(u)). By the chain rule,
∂g(u)
∂uj
= ∂f(x)
∂xi
∂F i(u)
∂uj
.
Hence dgu(k) = ∂g(u)
∂uj kj = dfx(F ′(u)k). This ﬁnishes the proof.
In practical computation, we recommend the reader to use the elegant
Leibniz formula (i) above.

Our proof justiﬁes this.
The language of physicists. Let f : Rn →R be a smooth function. Set Δx := h
and Δf(x) := f(x + Δx) −f(x). By Taylor expansion,
Δf(x) = f ′(x)Δx + o(Δx),
Δx →0.
Physicist frequently write df and dx instead of Δf and Δx, respectively, and
they cancel the remainder o(Δx). This is convenient for practical purposes.
However, from the mathematical point o view, one has to distinguish between
• the linear functional df(x) : Rn →R and
• the real number Δf(x).
5.3 Proof of Proposition 5.12 on page 324. Solution: Ad (i). Let ω := dx ∧dy.
Consider the diﬀeomorphism F : R2 →R2 given by ξ = ξ(x, y), η = η(x, y).
We want to determine the map F in such a way that
F ∗ω = ω
on R2.
To this end, we will use the Leibniz method discussed in Problem 5.2. From
dξ = ξxdx + ξydy,
dη = ηxdx + ηydy,
we get dξ ∧dη = (ξxηy −ξyηx) dx ∧dy. Therefore, the equation
dξ ∧dη = dx ∧dy
on R2
is equivalent to ξxηy −ξyηx = 1 on R2.
Ad (ii). Use the same argument.

numbers α, β with α2 + β2 ̸= 0 and

for all

Solution: Set ⟨f|g⟩:=
R b
a f(x)g(x)dx, and ||f||2 =
p
⟨f|f⟩. By homogeneity, it
is suﬃcient to prove the claim for ||g|| = 1. Deﬁne F(t) := ||f + tg||2 for all
t ∈R. Then
F(t) = ⟨f + tg|f + tg⟩= ⟨f|f⟩+ 2t⟨f|g⟩+ t2.
The equation
F(t) = 0,
t ∈R
has the zeros t± = −⟨f|g⟩±
p
⟨f|g⟩2 −||f||2. Note that F(t) ≥0 for all t ∈R.
• If F(t) > 0 for all t ∈R, then ⟨f|g⟩2 −||f||2 < 0.
• If F(t) = 0 for some t, then ⟨f|g⟩2 −||f||2 = 0.

Solution: Set ⟨f|g⟩:=

Historical remark. The Schwarz inequality is named after Amandus Schwarz
(1843–1921) who published this inequality in 1884. However, this inequality
was obtained much earlier by Cauchy (1789–1857) in 1821 (for sequences of
numbers) and by Bunyakovskii (1804–1889) in 1859 (for integrals). Therefore,
the inequality is also called the Cauchy–Bunyakovskii inequality.
5.6 The Beltrami model in non-Euclidean geometry. Set z := x + iy. Let int(B1)
denote the open unit disc {z ∈C : |z| < 1} in the complex plane C. for ε = 1
and ε = −1, study the following two metrics
ds2 = 4(dx2 + dy2)
(1 + ε|z|2)2
on int(B1).
For ε = −1 (resp. ε = 1), this metric represents the hyperbolic (resp. elliptic)
Beltrami model. Let ε = −1. Show that the function
w =
„z + 1

,
z ∈int(B1)
maps conformally the open unit disc onto the open upper-half plane HC. Show
that the inverse map transforms the hyperbolic metric on HC into the metric
above with ε = −1. Prove that the hyperbolic straight lines on HC become
circles on int(B1) which orthogonally intersect the unit circle. The points on
the unit circle are regarded as ”points of inﬁnity.” Use the corresponding K¨ahler
metric in order to compute the Gaussian curvature K ≡1 (resp. K ≡−1) if
ε = 1 (resp. ε = −1).
5.7 Geodesics and the Christoﬀel symbols. Fix n = 1, 2, . . . Let U be a nonempty
set of Rn. Set x = (x1, . . . , xn). We are given a family of smooth functions
gij(x) : Rn →R,
i, j = 1, . . . , n
with gij(x) = gji(x) for all points x ∈U and all indices i, j = 1, . . . , n. Suppose
that the symmetric (n × n)-matrix G := (gij(x)) is invertible for all x ∈U.
Denote the entries of the inverse matrix G(x)−1 by gij(x). Now consider the
energetic variational problem
Z τ1
τ0
gij(x(τ)) ˙xi(τ) ˙xj(τ) dτ = critical!
(5.120)
with ﬁxed end points x(τ0) and x(τ1). We are looking for a smooth function
x : [τ0, τ1] →U on the compact interval [τ0, τ1]. In what follows we sum over
equal upper and lower indices from 1 to n. The meaning of variational problems
concerning critical values is explained on page 805 of Vol. I.
Show that every smooth solution of the variational problem satisﬁes the Euler–
Lagrange equation
¨xk(τ) + Γ k
ij(x(τ)) ˙xi(τ) ˙xj(τ) = 0,
τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, k = 1, . . . , n

d
dτ L ˙xs −Lxs = 0,
s = 1, . . . , n.
Since L ˙xs = gsj ˙xj + gis ˙xi and Lxs = (∂sgij) ˙xi ˙xj, we get
gsj ¨xj + gis¨xi + (∂rgsj) ˙xr ˙xj + (∂rgis) ˙xr ˙xi −(∂sgij) ˙xi ˙xj = 0.
Because of the symmetry gij = gji, we obtain
2gsj ¨xj + (∂igsj + ∂jgis −∂sgij) ˙xi ˙xj = 0.
Since gksgsj = δk
j (Kronecker symbol), we get
¨xk + 1
2gks(∂igsj + ∂jgis −∂sgij) ˙xi ˙xj = 0.
5.8 Proof of Theorem 5.14 on page 335. Solution: (I) Special case: To display the
simple idea of the proof, let us ﬁrst consider the special case pictured in Fig.
5.31. The diﬀerential equation for the clockwise parallel transport along the
boundary ∂T of the triangle T reads as
˙ψ(τ) = −˙xj(τ)Aj(P(τ))ψ(τ),
0 ≤τ ≤τ1,
ψ(0) = ψ0.
(5.121)
Hence
Π∂T ψ0 −ψ0 =

˙ψ(τ)dτ = −

dxjAj(P)ψ(P).
The basic trick of the proof is to extend the values of ψ on the boundary ∂T
to the triangle T in a smooth way. Set

Noting that ∂k(Ajψ) = ∂kAj · ψ + Aj∂kψ, we get
B = ∂1A2(P)ψ0 −∂2A1(P)ψ0 + A2(P)∂1ψ(P) −A2(P)∂1ψ(P).
By (5.121), ∂1ψ(P) = −A2(P)ψ0 and ψ2(P) = A2(P)ψ0. Hence
B = {∂1A2(P) −∂2A1(P) + A1(P)A2(P) −A2(P)A1(P)}ψ0 = F12(P)ψ0.
Finally, by Fig. 5.31, det(a, b) = a1b2. Hence
FP (a, b) = F12(dx1 ∧dx2)(a, b) = F12(P)(a1b2 −a2b1) = F12(P)a1b2.
(II) General case: Proceed similarly as in (I).

6. The Principle of Critical Action and the
Harmonic Oscillator – Ariadne’s Thread in
Classical Mechanics
Since the divine plan is the most perfect thing there is, there can be no
doubt that all actions in the universe can be determined by the calculus
of the minima and maxima from the corresponding causes.
Leonhard Euler
The history of the principle of least action has often been described. Yet
the matter is still controversial, and there seems to be no general agree-
ment who invented the principle, Leibniz (1646–1717), Euler (1707–1783),
or Maupertuis (1698–1759). . . We mention that the ﬁrst mathematical
treatment of the action principle was given by Euler in the Additamentum
of his Methodus inveniendi.1

By generalizing the method of Euler in the calculus of variations, Lagrange
(1736–1813) discovered, how one can write, in a single line, the basic equa-
tion for all problems in analytic mechanics.
Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi (1804–1851)
When we quantize a classical theory, wave packets behave like particles. . .
A wave packet might decay into two wave packets. When two wave packets
come near to each other, they scatter and perhaps produce more wave
packets. This naturally suggests the physics of particles can be described
in these terms. . .
Quantum ﬁeld theory grew out of essentially these sorts of physical ideas.
It struck me as limiting that even after some 75 years, the whole subject
of quantum ﬁeld theory remains rooted in this harmonic paradigm, to use
a dreadfully pretentious word. We have not been able to get away from
the basic notions of oscillations and wave packets. Indeed, string theory,
the heir to quantum ﬁeld theory, is still ﬁrmly founded on this harmonic

paradigm. Surely, a brilliant young physicist, perhaps a reader of this book,
will take us beyond.2
Anthony Zee, 2003
The aim of this and the following chapter is to explain the basic physical and
mathematical ideas of classical mechanics and quantum mechanics by considering
the so-called harmonic oscillator. In all ﬁelds of physics, one encounters oscillating
systems. Let us mention the following examples:
• electromagnetic waves and light (photons);
• laser beams (coherent states);
• oscillating molecules in a gas or a liquid;
• sound waves (phonons);
• oscillations of a crystal lattice (phonons);
• oscillations of a string (e.g., a violin string);
• waves in a plasma (plasmons);
• matter waves of elementary particles (e.g., electrons);
• gravitational waves (gravitons).
The harmonic oscillator represents the simplest oscillating system. The quantization
of the harmonic oscillator is the basis of quantum mechanics, quantum ﬁeld theory,
and condensed matter physics.
System of physical units. In this chapter, we will use the international system
of units, SI (see the Appendix of Vol. I).
6.1 Prototypes of Extremal Problems
The calculus of variations has its roots in extremal problems for real-valued
functions.
Folklore
The one-dimensional problem. Let f : J →R be a smooth function on the
open interval J. Consider the minimum problem
f(x) = min!,
x ∈J.
(6.1)
Let us recall some standard results from classical calculus.
(i) Necessary condition for a local minimum: If x0 is a solution of (6.1), then
f ′(x0) = 0 and f ′′(x0) ≥0.
(ii) Suﬃcient condition for a local minimum: If f ′(x0) = 0 and f ′′(x0) > 0, then
the function f has a local minimum at the point x0. This means that there
exists a suﬃciently small positive number ε such that f(x) ≥f(x0) for all
x ∈]x0 −ε, x0 + ε[.
(iii) Suﬃcient condition for a global minimum: If f ′(x0) = 0, f ′′(x0) > 0, and
f ′′(x) ≥0 on J, then the function f is convex on J, and the minimum problem
(6.1) has the unique solution x0.

Now consider the more general problem
f(x) = critical!,
x0 ∈J.
(6.2)
By deﬁnition, the point x0 is a solution of (6.2) iﬀf ′(x0) = 0. We say that x0 is
a critical point of f, and the function is critical (or stationary) at the point x0.
Intuitively, the function f is critical at the point x0 iﬀthe tangent line of the graph
of the function f at the point x0 is horizontal (Fig. 6.1). For example, the function
f : R →R given by f(x) := x2 has a global minimum at the point x0 = 0. In
contrast to this, the function f(x) := x3 has the unique critical point x0 = 0,
but no minimal point. The function f(x) := sin x has precisely the critical points
x0 = ±π(n + 1
2) with n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Quadratic minimum problem. Set f(x, y) := αx2 + βy2, and assume that
β > α > 0. Then the free minimum problem
f(x, y) = min!,
(x, y) ∈R2
(6.3)
has the unique solution (x0, y0) = (0, 0). The constrained minimum problem
f(x, y) = min!,
x2 + y2 = 1,
(x, y) ∈R2
(6.4)
has the unique solution (x0, y0) = (1, 0) with f(x0, y0) = α. Consider now the more
general quadratic function
f(x, y) := ax2 + 2bxy + cy2,
(6.5)
where a, b, c are real numbers. Using the matrix A :=
 
a b
b c
!
, this can be written
as f(x, y) = (x, y)A
 
x
y
!
. Assume that the characteristic equation
det(λI −A) = 0,
λ ∈R,
that is, λ2 −(a + c)λ + ac −b2 = 0, has two solutions α and β with β > α > 0.
Then the free minimum problem (6.3) has the unique solution (0, 0), and
the constrained minimum problem (6.4) has a solution (x0, y0) with the
minimal value f(x0, y0) = α.
In fact, it follows from the principal axis theorem for symmetric matrices A that
the problems for the quadratic function f from (6.5) can be reduced to the corre-
sponding problems for the simpler function f(x, y) = αx2 +βy2, by using a rotation

362
6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
(orthogonal transformation). The numbers α and β are the eigenvalues of the ma-
trix A. It can be shown that the unique solution (x0, y0) of (6.4) is precisely the
normalized eigenvector of the matrix A which belongs to the smallest eigenvalue α.
The Morse index. Let α ̸= 0 and β ̸= 0. By deﬁnition, the Morse index
if(0, 0) of the quadratic form f from (6.5) at the point (0, 0) is equal to the number
of negative eigenvalues of the matrix A. Then the following hold:
• If if(0, 0) = 0 (i.e., α > 0 and β > 0), then f has a global minimum at the point
(0, 0).
• If if(0, 0) = 2 (i.e., α < 0 and β < 0), then f has a global maximum at the point
(0, 0).
• If if(0, 0) = 1 (i.e., αβ < 0), then f has a saddle point at (0, 0).
For example, the function f(x, y) := 2x2 −y2 has a saddle point at (0, 0), whereas
f(x, y) := −x2 −y2 has a global maximum at (0, 0).
First and second variation. Let f : R2 →R be a smooth function. For ﬁxed
(h, k) ∈R2, we set
χ(σ) := f(x0 + σh, y0 + σk),
σ ∈R.
We deﬁne
δf(x0, y0; h, k) := χ′(0),
(6.6)
and call this the ﬁrst variation of the function f at the point (x0, y0) in direction
of (h, k). Similarly, we deﬁne the second variation of f by setting
δ2f(x0, y0; h, k) := χ′′(0).
It follows from the Taylor theorem that
χ(σ) = χ(0) + χ′(0)σ + 1
2χ′′(0)σ2 + . . .
Hence
f(x0 + σh, y0 + σk) = f(x0, y0) + δf(x0, y0; h, k)σ + 1
2δ2f(x0, y0; h, k)σ2 + . . .
Explicitly, in terms of partial derivatives,
δf(x0, y0; h, k) = fx(x0, y0)h + fy(x0, y0)k,
δ2f(x0, y0; h, k) = fxx(x0, y0)h2 + 2fxy(x0, y0)hk + fyy(x0, y0)k2.
Physicists use the notation δx := σh and δy := σk. Then
f(x0 + δx, y0 + δy) = f(x0, y0) + δf(x0, y0; δx, δy) + 1
2δ2f(x0, y0; δx, δy) + . . .
If we introduce the two matrices f ′(x0, y0) := (fx(x0, y0), fy(x0, y0)), and
f ′′(x0, y0) :=
 
fxx(x0, y0) fxy(x0, y0)
fxy(x0, y0) fyy(x0, y0)

then δf(x0, y0; δx, δy) = f ′(x0, y0)

6.1 Prototypes of Extremal Problems
363
Here, f ′(x0, y0) (resp. f ′′(x0, y0)) is called the ﬁrst (resp. second) Fr´echet derivative3
of the map f : R2 →R. Furthermore, the matrix f ′′(x0, y0) (resp. the determinant
det f ′′(x0, y0)) is called the Hessian (resp. the Jacobian) of the map f at the point
(x0, y0).
Observe that the use of the function χ allows us to reduce extremal problems for
functions of several real variables to the inspection of functions of one real variable.
The same trick can be applied to variational problems.
This will be shown in Sect. 6.5.
Critical points. By deﬁnition, the function f has the critical point (x0, y0) iﬀ
the function χ has the critical point σ = 0, for all choices h, k ∈R. This means that
δf(x0, y0; h, k) = 0
for all
(h, k) ∈R2.
Equivalently, f ′(x0, y0) = 0, that is, fx(x0, y0) = fy(x0, y0) = 0.
Nonlinear minimum problem. Again let f : J →R be a smooth function,
where J is a nonempty open subset of R2. For the minimum problem
f(x, y) = min!,
(x, y) ∈J
(6.7)
the following hold:
(i) Necessary condition for a local minimum. If (x0, y0) is a solution of (6.7), then
f ′(x0, y0) = 0.4 This is the prototype of the Euler–Lagrange equation in the
calculus of variations.
(ii) Suﬃcient condition for a local minimum. Suppose that f ′(x0, y0) = 0, and
suppose that Jacobi’s accessory minimum problem
δ2f(x0, y0; h, k) = min!,
h2 + k2 = 1,
(h, k) ∈R2
has a positive minimal value.5 Then f has a local minimum at the point (x0, y0).
This is the prototype of Jacobi’s eigenvalue method in the calculus of variations.
The Morse index. Suppose that f ′(x0, y0) = 0 together with
det f ′′(x0, y0) ̸= 0.
The Morse index if(x0, y0) of the map f : J →R at the point (x0, y0) is equal to
the number of negative eigenvalues of the matrix f ′′(x0, y0), by deﬁnition.
• If if(x0, y0) = 0, then f has a local minimum at the point (x0, y0).
• If if(x0, y0) = 2, then f has a local maximum at the point (x0, y0).
• If if(x0, y0) = 1, then f has a saddle point at (x0, y0).
Constrained minimum problem and Lagrange multipliers. We are given
the smooth functions f, g : R2 →R. We consider the minimum problem
f(x, y) = min!,
g(x, y) = 0,
(x, y) ∈R2.
(6.8)
3 Fr´echet (1878–1973).
4 To prove this, note that, for ﬁxed h, k ∈R, the function χ has a minimum at the
point σ = 0. Hence χ′(0) = 0. This implies δf(x0, y0; h, k) = 0 for all h, k ∈R.
Therefore, f ′(x0, y0) = 0.
5 This is equivalent to the fact that the eigenvalues of f ′′(x0, y0) are positive. In
turn, this is equivalent to fxx(x0, y0) > 0 together with det f ′′(x0, y0) > 0.

• Necessary condition for a constrained local minimum: If (x0, y0) is a local solution
of (6.8) and g′(x0, y0) ̸= 0 , then there exists a real number λ such that
f ′(x0, y0) −λg′(x0, y0) = 0.
(6.9)
The number λ is called a Lagrange multiplier.
• Suﬃcient condition for a constrained local minimum: Suppose that the point
(x0, y0) satisﬁes the side condition g(x0, y0) = 0. Furthermore, suppose that there
exists a real number λ such that the condition (6.9) holds and the deﬁniteness
condition
δ2f(x0, y0; h, k) −λδ2g(x0, y0; h, k) > 0
is satisﬁed for all (h, k) ∈R2 with h2 + k2 > 0 and δg(x0, y0; h, k) = 0. Then the
point (x0, y0) is a local solution of (6.8).
For example, let f(x, y) := ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 with real numbers a, b, c, and let
g(x, y) := x2 + y2. Then each local solution (x0, y0) of (6.8) satisﬁes the eigen-
value equation (6.9), that is, fx(x0, y0) = λgx(x0, y0) and fy(x0, y0) = λgy(x0, y0).
Explicitly,

Therefore, the Lagrange multiplier λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix A. All the proofs

6.2 The Motion of a Particle
The Euclidean manifold E3. We start with the motion
Q = Q(t),
t ∈R
of a particle (e.g., the motion of a planet around the sun) in the 3-dimensional space
of our intuition. Here, Q(t) is the position of the particle at time t. The set of all
positions Q is called the Euclidean manifold E3. In what follows, it is convenient
to use the language of both the vector calculus and the theory of manifolds. First
ﬁx a point O as origin (e.g., the position of the sun). Then the motion can also be
described by the vector equation
q = q(t),
t ∈R.
Here, the position vector q(t) points from the origin O to the point Q(t). We also
write q(t) = OQ(t). Let TOE3 denote the space of all vectors with initial point at

product
⟨q|r⟩O := qr
for all
q, r ∈TOE3.
Recall that qr := |q| · |r| · cos α. Here, |q| denotes the length of the vector q, and α
is the angle between the two vectors q and r. The angle α is chosen in such a way
that 0 ≤α ≤π (Fig. 6.3). Similarly, let TQE3 denote the space of all vectors with
the initial point Q. The space TQE3 is a real 3-dimensional Hilbert space equipped
with the inner product
⟨v|w⟩Q := vw
for all
v, w ∈TQE3.

whose initial point coincides with the position Q(t) of the particle at time t, that
is, ˙q(t) ∈TQ(t)E3 (Fig. 6.4). The space TQE3 consists of all the possible velocity
vectors at the point Q. In the terminology of the theory of manifolds, the space
TQE3 is called the tangent space of the Euclidean manifold E3 at the point Q.
To simplify notation, we denote the 3-dimensional real Hilbert space TOE3 by the
symbol E3. We then have the Hilbert space isomorphism

Q ∈E3.
The Lie algebra of the Hilbert space TQE3. Let q, r ∈TQE3. Recall that,

handed orthogonal system. The angle α between the vectors q and r is given as
pictured in Fig. 6.3, that is, 0 ≤α ≤π. Moreover, q × r ∈TQE3. The diﬀerence

the vector product q × r, the linear real linear 3-dimensional space TQE3 becomes
a real Lie algebra. We will show in Sect. 6.12 that this Lie algebra is isomorphic to
the Lie algebra su(E3) of inﬁnitesimal rotations.
6.3 Newtonian Mechanics
The rise of modern science was accompanied with the replacement of au-
thorities or traditions by causes in explaining phenomena. One of the ulti-
mate goals of science is to understand the world, and this is approached by
scientiﬁc explanation, that is, by ﬁnding out causes for various phenom-
ena. According to Aristotle, however, there are diﬀerent kinds of cause:
material, formal, eﬃcient, and ﬁnal causes. Before the rise of modern sci-
ence, teleological explanation based on the notion of ﬁnal cause was a
dominant mode of explanation. With the revival of Neoplatonism, Archi-
medianism and atomism in the Renaissance, there began a transformation
in basic assumptions of scientiﬁc explanation. Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo,
and Descartes, for example, believed that the underlying truth and univer-
sal harmony of the world can be perfectly represented by simple and exact
mathematical expressions. The mathematization of nature led to a certain
degree of popularity of formal cause. But the most popular and powerful
conception of causality, in ﬁghting, against the teleological explanation,
was a mechanical one based on the notion of eﬃcient cause. Diﬀerent from
ﬁnal and formal causes, the idea of eﬃcient cause focuses on how the cause
is transmitted to the eﬀect, that is, on the mode of transmission. Accord-
ing to the classical mechanical view, causality can be reduced to the laws
of motion of bodies in space and time. . .

Galileo Galilei (1564–1642)
Lex prima: A stationary body will remain motionless, and a moving body
will continue to move in the same direction with unchanging speed unless
it is acted on by some force.
Lex secunda: The time-rate-of-change of the momentum of a body is pro-
portional to the force.
Lex tertia: If any body exerts a force on another object, then the second
object also exerts an equal and opposite force on the ﬁrst.
It remains that, from the same principles, I now demonstrate the frame of
the System of the World.

When one considers all that Newton achieved, and the cultural and scien-
tiﬁc environment in which he achieved it, there is reason to regard him as
the greatest scientist – and perhaps the greatest genius – that ever lived.
Anthony Philip French
The motion q = q(t) of a classical point particle of mass m on the real line is
described by the Newtonian equation “time-derivative of momentum equals force,”
˙p(t) = F(q(t)),
(6.10)
together with the initial condition q(t0) = q0 and ˙q(t0) = v0 (Fig. 6.6). Here, the
position q0 and the velocity v0 of the particle are prescribed at the initial time t0.
It turns out that many problems in physics can be essentially simpliﬁed by using
potentials. To explain this in the present situation, use the force function F in order
to deﬁne
W :=
Z q
q0
F(x)dx,
and U(q) := U(0) −W. Hence
F(q) = −U ′(q).

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
The function U is called a potential of the force F. Note that the normalization
constant U(0) of the potential can be chosen arbitrarily. A change of U(0) represents
the simplest gauge transformation in physics. We will show later on that gauge
transformations play a fundamental role in modern elementary particle physics
(gauge ﬁeld theory). Using the trajectory q = q(t), we also deﬁne
E(t) := 1
2m ˙q(t)2 + U(q(t)).
In what follows, we will use the following terminology:
q(t)
position of the particle at time t,
˙q(t)
velocity at time t,
¨q(t)
acceleration at time t,
p(t) := m ˙q(t)
momentum at time t,
F(q)
force acting at the point q,
W
work done by the force if the particle moves from
the initial point q0 to the ﬁnal point q,
U(q)
potential energy of the particle at position q,
1
2m ˙q(t)2
kinetic energy of the particle at time t,
E(t)
total energy of the particle at time t.
Constant mass. Let us ﬁrst consider mass points of constant positive mass
m. The Newtonian equation of motion reads then as
m¨q(t) = F(q(t)),
t ∈R,
q(t0) = q0, ˙q(t0) = v0.
(6.11)
This corresponds to “force equals mass times acceleration”. For a smooth force
F : R →R, it follows from the general theory of ordinary diﬀerential equations
that there exists a maximal open time interval J containing the initial time t0 such
that the initial-value problem (6.11) has a unique solution q = q(t) on J. Such a
solution is called a trajectory of the particle. For example, the initial-value problem
¨x(t) = 2x(t) ˙x(t),
x(0) = 0,
˙x(0) = 1
has the unique solution x(t) = tan t, −π
2 < t < π
2 , which blows up as time t goes to
π
2 from the left. This example shows that the trajectories do not always exist for
all times.
Theorem 6.1 The total energy E of the particle is constant during the motion.
Proof. Diﬀerentiation with respect to time t yields
˙E(t) = m¨q(t) ˙q(t) + U ′(q(t)) ˙q(t) =
`
m¨q(t) −F(q(t)
´
˙q(t) = 0.
Hence E(t) is constant on the time interval J.

Example 6.2 (The falling stone). Consider the constant force F := −mg. Then,
the unique solution of the equation of motion (6.11) is given by
q(t) = q0 + v0t −1
2gt2
for all times
t ∈R.
(6.12)

6.3 Newtonian Mechanics

This law of falling bodies was ﬁrst discovered by Galilei in about 1600. If the initial
velocity is negative, v0 < 0, equation (6.12) describes a falling stone on earth of
mass m. Here, q(t) denotes the height of the stone at time t, and g = 9.81 m/s2
is the so-called acceleration constant on earth. The potential energy of the stone is
given by
U(q) = mgq,
provided we use the normalization condition U(0) := 0. If the stone is falling down
from the height q0 > 0 to the ground q = 0, then the stone looses the potential
energy mgq0. The stone possesses the constant total energy
E = 1
2mv2
0 + mgq0
during the motion. If the stone hits the ground, then the total (mechanical) energy
E is converted into heat energy.
Loss of mass. If the mass m(t) changes in time, then we get the momentum
p(t) = m(t)q(t), and the Newtonian equation of motion reads as
d
dt
`
m(t)q(t)
´
= F(q(t)).
(6.13)
This models a rocket loosing mass by burning fuel. Einstein discovered that the
mass of each moving body depends on its velocity,
m(t) =
m0
p
1 −˙q(t)2/c2 .
Here, the symbols m0 and c denote the rest mass of the particle and the speed
of light in a vacuum, respectively. Equation (6.13) passes then over to the basic
equation of relativistic motion. In this chapter, we will only consider point particles
having time-independent constant positive mass m (non-relativistic motion).

along with the initial condition q(0) = q0,
˙q(0) = v0, describes the motion of a
so-called harmonic oscillator. We are given the positive constant ω. The unique
solution of this initial-value problem reads as
q = q0 cos ωt + v0
ω sin ωt,
(6.15)
for all real times t. This motion has the time period T, where
T = 2π
ω .
The quantities ω and ν := ω/2π are called angular frequency and frequency, re-
spectively. Hence T = 1/ν.
The harmonic oscillator represents the simplest oscillating system. Let us mo-
tivate this. Consider a point of constant positive mass m under the action of the
repulsive force
F(q) = −αq.

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
Here, α is a positive constant. Introducing the constant ω := α/m, equation (6.14)
corresponds to the Newtonian equation, m¨q = −αq. The universality of the har-
monic oscillator follows from the fact that each smooth force F, with F(0) = 0 and
the symmetry property F(−q) = −F(q) for all real q, allows the Taylor expansion
F(q) = −αq −βq3 + ...
for small
q ∈R.
If the force F is repulsive, then q > 0 implies F(q) < 0. Hence α > 0 and β ≥0.
The ﬁrst approximation reads as F(q) = −αq. If we set α := mω2, then we obtain
a force which precisely corresponds to the harmonic oscillator. This force has the
potential
U = 1
2mω2q2.
For the motion of the harmonic oscillator, energy conservation means that the
function (6.15) satisﬁes the condition

Anharmonic oscillator. The second approximation of the force F reads as
F(q) = −αq −βq3
with the positive constant β. We set β = mκ, and call κ the coupling constant.
Now the equation of motion reads as
¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = −κq(t)3.

One needs to have delved but little into the principles of diﬀerential cal-
culus to know the method of how to determine the greatest and least
ordinates of curves. But there are maxima or minima problems of a higher
order, which in fact depend on the same method, which however cannot
be subjected to this method. These are the problems where it is a matter
of ﬁnding the curves themselves.
The ﬁrst problem of this type, which the geometers solved, is that of
the brachistochrone or the curve of fastest fall which Johann Bernoulli
proposed toward the end of the preceding century. One attained this only
in special ways, and it was only some time later and on the occasion of the
investigations concerning isoperimetric problems that the great geometer

where the constant C is determined by the ﬁnal point. The proof can be found
in Zeidler (1995b), p. 132 (see the references on page 1049).

of whom we just spoke and his extraordinary brother Jakob Bernoulli gave
some rules in order to solve several other problems of this type.
But since these rules were not of suﬃcient generality, the famous Euler
undertook to refer all investigations of this type to a general method. 10 But
even as sophisticated and fruitful as his method is, one must nevertheless
confess that it is not suﬃciently simple. . . Now here one ﬁnds a method
which requires only a simple use of the principles of diﬀerential and integral
calculus.
Joseph Louis Lagrange, 1762
As I see, your analytic solution of the isoperimetric problem contains all
that one can wish for in this situation. I am very happy that this theory
which I have treated since the ﬁrst attempts almost alone, has been brought
precisely by you to the highest degree of perfection.
The importance of the situation has occasioned me with the help of your
new insights to myself conceive of an analytic solution, but which I shall
not make known before you have published your deliberations, in order
not to deprive you of the least part of the fame due you.

The mathematician is perfect only in so far as he is a perfect being, in so

10 Euler used an involved diﬀerence method. He could merely apply his method to
one-dimensional variational problems.
11 Euler was born in Basel (Switzerland) in 1707, and he studied at the University
of Basel. In 1727 he moved to the newly founded Academy in St. Petersburg
(Russia). From 1741 until 1766 Euler worked at the Berlin Academy. In 1766, he
moved back to Saint Petersburg where he died in 1783.
The Prussian king Frederyck the Great (1712–1786) appointed Lagrange as Eu-
ler’s successor at the Berlin Academy. In 1786 Lagrange returned from Berlin to
Paris. In 1788 he published his famous treatise ”M´echanique analitique” about
the foundations of celestial mechanics. The title changed to “M´ecanique ana-
lytique” in 1813, after the reform of the French orthography initiated by the
French Academy.

is called the Lagrangian, and
S[q] :=
Z t1
t0
L(q(t), ˙q(t), t) dt
is called the action of the motion along the given trajectory q = q(t) during the
ﬁxed time interval [t0, t1]. The action S has the physical dimension of energy times
time.
6.5.1 The Harmonic Oscillator
As an example, let us consider the special case of the harmonic oscillator where
L(q, ˙q) := 1
2m ˙q2 −1
2mω2q2.
The constants m and ω are assumed to be positive. The following theorem tells us
that the Euler–Lagrange equation to the variational problem (6.17) coincides with
the Newtonian equation of motion for the harmonic oscillator.
Proposition 6.3 Each smooth solution of (6.17) satisﬁes the Euler–Lagrange
equation ¨q + ω2q = 0.
Proof. To simplify notation, let us set m = ω := 1. The following argument is
typical for all kind of variational problems. Recall that D(t0, t1) denotes the set
of all smooth functions h :]t0, t1[→R, which have compact support, that is, each
function h vanishes in some neighborhood of the boundary points. In particular,
h(t0) = h(t1) = 0. The functions h are called test functions.
(I) Minimum problem. Replace ﬁrst “critical!” by “min!”. Suppose that the
function q = q(t) is a solution of (6.17). The basic idea due to Lagrange consists in
reducing the original variational problem to a simpler problem for a real function
χ. To this end, ﬁx a function h ∈D(t0, t1), and consider the following family of
functions,
r(t) := q(t) + σh(t),
t0 ≤t ≤t1,
which depends on the real parameter σ. Since h(t0) = h(t1) = 0, the function
r = r(t) satisﬁes the boundary condition r(t0) = q0, r(t1) = q1 from (6.17). Set
χ(σ) :=
R t1
t0 L(r(t), ˙r(t)) dt. Explicitly,
χ(σ) :=
Z t1
t0
1
2{( ˙q(t) + σ ˙h(t))2 −(q(t) + σh(t))2} dt,
for all σ ∈R. If σ = 0, then r = q. Since q is a solution of the minimum problem
(6.17) and the function r is admissible (i.e., r satisﬁes the boundary condition of
the variational problem), we get
χ(σ) ≥χ(0)
for all
σ ∈R.
Thus, the real function χ has a minimum at the point σ = 0. Hence we get the key
relation
χ′(0) = 0.
(6.19)
Diﬀerentiation with respect to the parameter σ yields

374
6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
χ′(0) =
Z t1
t0
( ˙q ˙h −qh)dt.
Integration by parts implies the so-called variational equation12
χ′(0) =
Z t1
t0
`
−¨q(t) −q(t)
´
h(t) dt = 0.
(6.20)
This is true for all test functions h ∈D(t0, t1). Therefore, the variational lemma
(see Sect. 7.20.2 of Vol. I) tells us that ¨q(t) + q(t) = 0 on [t0, t1].
(II) Critical point. By deﬁnition, problem (6.17) means that each of the func-
tions χ introduced above is critical at the point σ = 0. This implies (6.19). We now
proceed as in (I).

First variation. Motivated by Sect. 6.1, we set δS(q; h) := χ′(0). Explicitly,
δS(q, h) =
Z t1
t0
`
˙q(t)˙h(t) −q(t)h(t)
´
dt
for all
h ∈D(t0, t1).
This is called the ﬁrst variation of the action functional S at the point q in direction
of h.
First functional derivative. After integrating by parts, we obtain
δS(q, h) = δS[q]
δq (h)
for all
h ∈D(t0, t1)
(6.21)
with δS[q]
δq (h) :=
R t1
t0
δS[q]
δq(t) h(t)dt and
δS[q]
δq(t) := −¨q(t) −q(t)
for all
t ∈[t0, t1].
Here, the functional h 
→δS[q]
δq (h) is called the functional derivative of the action
functional S at the point q, and the function t 
→δS[q]
δq(t) is called the local functional
derivative of the action functional S at the point q and at time t. The Euler–
Lagrange equation can elegantly be written as
δS[q]
δq(t) = 0,
t0 ≤t ≤t1.
(6.22)
Second variation. Deﬁne δ2S(q; h) := χ′′(0). Explicitly,
δ2S(q; h) =
Z t1
t0
`˙h(t)2 −h(t)2´
dt.
This is called the second variation of the action functional S at the point q in
direction of h. Integration by parts yields
δ2S(q; h) = −
Z t1
t0
“
¨h(t) + h(t)
”
h(t) dt
for all
h ∈D(t0, t1).
It follows from χ(1) = χ(0) + χ′(0) + 1
2χ′′(0) that
12 Note that the boundary term ˙q(t1)h(t1) −˙q(t0)h(t0) vanishes, since the function
h vanishes at the boundary.

S[q + h] = S[q] + δS(q, h) + 1
2δ2S(q; h)
for all smooth functions q : [t0, t1] →R, and all test functions h ∈D(t0, t1).
Physicists write δq := h. If q is a critical point of S (i.e., q is a solution of the
Euler–Lagrange equation), then δS(q; h) = 0. Hence
S[q + h] = S[q] + 1
2δ2S(q; h)
for all
h ∈D(t0, t1).
(6.23)
Consequently, q is a minimum of S if
δ2S(q; h) ≥0
for all test functions h ∈D(t0, t1). In the next section, we will use this observation
in order to prove the Jacobi eigenvalue criterion for the existence of a minimum.

δq2 (h, k) is called the
second functional derivative of the action functional S at the point q. In particular,
for the second variation we get
δ2S(q; h) = δ2S[q]
δq2
(h, h)
for all
h ∈D(t0, t1).
6.5.2 The Euler–Lagrange Equation
Suppose that the Lagrangian L is smooth. The same argument as in the proof of
Prop. 6.3 yields the following fundamental result due to Lagrange.
Theorem 6.4 Each smooth solution of the variational problem (6.17) satisﬁes the
Euler–Lagrange equation
d
dtL ˙q = Lq.
(6.24)
Explicitly, this means
d
dtL ˙q(q(t), ˙q(t), t) = Lq(q(t), ˙q(t), t).
If the trajectory q = q(t) has several components, q = (q1, ..., qM), then we have to
write down the Euler–Lagrange equation for each component. Explicitly,
d
dtL ˙qm = Lqm,
m = 1, ..., M.
(6.25)
Moreover, Lagrange’s elegant argument can be immediately generalized to multi-
dimensional integrals. Examples can be found in the problem section to Chap. 14
of Vol. I. As an introduction to the calculus of variations and optimization theory,
we recommend the author’s textbook Zeidler (1986), Vol. III (see the references on
page 1049).

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
6.5.3 Jacobi’s Accessory Eigenvalue Problem
Returning to the concepts of maximum and minimum, it is a nuisance that
there reigns such confusion in these words. One says that an expression
attains a maximum or a minimum if one simply wishes to say that it is
critical (or extremal) and hence its ﬁrst variation vanishes, also in the case
when neither a minimum nor a maximum occurs.
Carl Gustav Jacobi (1804–1851)
Let us study the principle of least action for the harmonic oscillator
S[q] :=
Z t1

“
˙q2(t) −ω2q2(t)
”
dt = min!
(6.26)
together with the boundary condition q(t0) = q0, q(t1) = q1. Here, we set m := 1.
The corresponding Euler–Lagrange equation reads as
¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = 0,
t ∈[t0, t1],
q(t0) = q0, q(t1) = q1.
(6.27)
Following Jacobi, we add the accessory eigenvalue problem
−¨h(t) −ω2h(t) = λh(t),
t ∈[t0, t1],
h(t0) = h(t1) = 0.
(6.28)
The eigensolutions are given by
hn(t) := sin nπ(t −t0)
t1 −t0
,
λn :=
n2π2
(t1 −t0)2 −ω2,
n = 1, 2, . . .
(6.29)
Proposition 6.5 Let q = q(t) be a solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation (6.27),
and let the smallest eigenvalue λ1 of (6.28) be positive. Then the function q is a
solution of the minimum problem (6.26).
For example, choose t0 := 0, t1 := π, q1 = q0 +1, and ω := 1
2. Then, we have λ1 > 0,
and hence the function q = q0 + sin ωt is a solution of (6.26).
Proof. Let us choose the real Hilbert space X := L2(t0, t1) with the inner product
⟨h|k⟩:=
Z t1
t0
h(t)k(t) dt.
We will use the operator A : D(A) →X deﬁned by
Ah := −¨h −ω2h
for all
h ∈X.
Here, D(A) is deﬁned to be the set of all twice continuously diﬀerentiable functions
h : [t0, t1] →R with h(t0) = h(t1) = 0. A classical result tells us13 that the
eigenfunctions h1, h2, . . . of the operator A form a complete orthonormal system in
the Hilbert space X, that is,
h =
∞
X
n=1
⟨hn|h⟩hn
for all
h ∈X.
13 We refer to Zeidler (1995a), Sect. 4.5 (see the references on page 1049).

6.5 Lagrangian Mechanics
377
Integration by parts shows that ⟨Ah|k⟩= ⟨h|Ak⟩for all h, k ∈D(A), that is, the
operator A is symmetric. Hence ⟨hn|Ah⟩= ⟨Ahn|h⟩= λn⟨hn|h⟩. This implies
Ah =
∞
X
n=1
⟨hn|Ah⟩hn =
∞
X
n=1
λn⟨hn|h⟩hn
for all
h ∈D(A).
Therefore, ⟨Ah|h⟩= P∞
n=1 λn⟨hn|h⟩2. This yields the key relation
δ2S(q; h) =
∞
X
n=1
λn⟨hn|h⟩2
for all
h ∈D(A).
(6.30)
By (6.23),
S[q + h] = S[q] + 1
2δ2S(q; h)
for all
h ∈D(A).
If λ1 > 0, then δ2S(q; h) ≥0. Hence S[q + h] ≥S[q] for all h ∈D(A).

6.5.4 The Morse Index
The Morse index describes the global behavior of the action functional of
the harmonic oscillator with respect to arbitrary time intervals. This global
behavior is governed by the appearance of focal points of the trajectories
of the harmonic oscillator, which correspond to focal points in geometric
optics.
Folklore
We are given the time interval [t0, t1]. Suppose that all of the eigenvalues λ1, λ2, . . .
introduced in (6.28) are diﬀerent from zero. Motivated by Sect. 6.1 and the key
relation (6.30), the Morse index μ(t0, t1) of the second variation h 
→δ2S(q; h)
on the time interval [t0, t1] is deﬁned to be the number of negative eigenvalues
λ1, λ2, . . .14 Explicitly, for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , we obtain
μ(t0, t1) = n
for all
t1 ∈
–
t0 + nπ
ω , t0 + (n + 1)π
ω
»
.
(6.31)
To discuss this, consider ﬁrst the case where
t0 < t1 < t0 + π
ω .
Then 0 < λ1 < λ2 < . . . Thus, all the eigenvalues λ1, λ2, . . . are positive. Hence
μ(t0, t1) = 0.
Suppose that the function q = q(t) is a solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation
(6.27). By Prop. 6.5, the function q = q(t) is a solution of the minimum problem
(6.26).
Consider now the case where t0 + nπ
ω < t1 < (n+1)π
ω
with n = 1, 2, . . . The we
have λ1 < 0. Hence
S[q + h1] = S[q] + 1
2δ2S(q; h1) = S[q] + 1
2λ1 < S[q].

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
In this case, the function q = q(t) is not a solution of the minimum problem (6.26)
on the time interval [t0, t1].
Observe that, by (6.29), the Morse index jumps at the critical time points
tcrit := t0 + nπ
ω ,
n = 1, 2, . . .
The Morse index plays a crucial role for the harmonic oscillator in quantum me-
chanics, where it is responsible for the jumps of the Feynman propagator (see Sect.
7.9.4 on page 576). In quantum mechanics, the Morse index is also called the Maslov
index.
6.5.5 The Anharmonic Oscillator
Let U : R →R be a given smooth function. By deﬁnition, an anharmonic oscillator
has the potential
U(q) := 1
2mω2q2 + 1
4mκq4
with the positive constants m (mass), ω (angular frequency), and κ (coupling con-
stant). The action functional to the potential U is given by
S[q] :=
Z t1
t0
“
1
2m ˙q2(t) −U
`
q(t)
´”
dt.
Setting χ(σ) := S[q + σh] with the real parameter σ, we get the nth variation
δnS(q, h) := χ(n)(0) where n = 1, 2, . . .
In what follows the function q : [t0, t1] →R is assumed to be smooth.
Choose the test function h ∈D(t0, t1). Explicitly, after integrating by parts, we get
the ﬁrst variation
δS(q; h) = δS[q]
δq (h) :=
Z t1
t0
δS[q]
δq(t) · h(t)dt
with the local ﬁrst functional derivative δS[q]
δq(t) := −m¨q(t)−U ′(q(t)), and the second
variation
δ2S(q; h) =

This is a quadratic form with respect to h. Introducing the second functional deriva-
tive δ2S[q]
δq2 (h, k) :=
d

δS[q+σk]
δq
(h)|σ=0, we obtain

“
−m¨k(t) −U ′′`

´
k(t)
”
h(t)dt
for all k, h ∈D(t0, t1). Furthermore, δ2S(q; h) =
δ2S[q]
δq2 (h, h). It follows from the
Taylor expansion χ(1) = χ(0) + χ′(0) + 1
2χ′′(ϑ) with 0 < ϑ < 1 that
S[q + h] = S[q] + δS(q; h) + δ2S(q + ϑh; h).

The principle of critical action versus the principle of least action.
Following Jacobi, let us compare the principle of critical action
S[q] = critical!,
q(t0) = q0, q(t1) = q1
(6.32)
with the principle of least action
S[q] = min!,
q(t0) = q0, q(t1) = q1.
(6.33)
We say that the function q : [t0, t1] →R is a local minimum of the action functional
S (i.e., a local solution of (6.33)) iﬀit satisﬁes the boundary condition and, for each
test function h ∈D(t0, t1), there exists a positive number σ0 such that
S[q + σh] ≥S[q]
for all
σ ∈[−σ0, σ0].
The accessory eigenvalue problem reads as
−m¨h(t) −U ′`

´
h(t) = λh(t),
t ∈[t0, t1],
h(t0) = h(t1) = 0.
(6.34)
This classical boundary-eigenvalue problem has a complete orthonormal system
h1, h2, . . . of eigenfunctions in the real Hilbert space L2(t0, t1) with the correspond-

local solution of (6.33)), then q is a solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation
δS[q]
δq(t) = 0,
t0 ≤t ≤t1,
q(t0) = q0, q(t1) = q1,
(6.35)
that is, m¨q(t) = −U ′(q(t)).
(ii) Suﬃcient condition for a local minimum: Conversely, suppose that the function
q is a solution of (6.35) and the Morse index is(q) is equal to zero. Then the
function q is a local minimum of the action functional S. If the Morse index
iS(q) is positive, then q is not a local minimum of the action functional S.
The linearized Euler–Lagrange equation and Jacobi ﬁelds. Choose the
test function h ∈D(t0, t1), and replace the Euler–Lagrange equation
m¨q + U ′(q) = 0
by m(¨q+σ¨h)+U ′(q+σh) = 0. Diﬀerentiation with respect to the real parameter σ at
σ = 0 yields the so-called linearized Euler–Lagrange equation (or Jacobi equation)

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
m¨h(t) + U ′(q(t))h(t) = 0,
t ∈[t0, t1],
h(t0) = h(t1) = 0.
(6.36)
The solutions h of this equation are called Jacobi ﬁelds. By deﬁnition, the point t0
is conjugate to the point t1 iﬀproblem (6.36) has a nontrivial solution (i.e., there
exists a nontrivial Jacobi ﬁeld). Equivalently, the accessory eigenvalue problem
(6.34) has the eigenvalue λ = 0.
If the interval [t0, t1] contains an interior point which is conjugate to t0,
then each solution q of the Euler–Lagrange equation (6.35) is not a local
minimum of the action functional S.
For example, in the case of the harmonic oscillator, the conjugate points to t0 are
tn,conj = t0 +nπ/ω with n = 1, 2, . . . If t1 < t1,conj, then the Morse index iS is equal
to zero. If we steadily increase the interval [t0, t1] for ﬁxed t0, then the Morse index
jumps each point t1,conj, t2,conj, . . . The jump is equal to one.
We will show in Sect. 7.10 that the appearance of conjugate points com-
plicates the computation of the Feynman path integral for the quantized
harmonic oscillator.
In turn, this complicates the most important approximation method in quantum
mechanics – the WKB method – which studies the singular limit ℏ→0 (i.e., the
Planck action quantum goes to zero). In geometric optics, conjugate points corre-
spond to focal points which represent singularities of the light ray conﬁguration.
The classical results quoted above are special cases of a more general functional-
analytic result whose proof can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. III, p. 201 (see the
references on page 1049). Roughly speaking, the following hold:
The principle of least action is valid for suﬃciently small time intervals.
6.5.6 The Ginzburg–Landau Potential and the Higgs Potential
Let us study the prototype of a phase transition by considering the Ginzburg–
Landau potential
U(q) := (q2 −a2)2,
q ∈R
for ﬁxed positive parameter a. The principle of critical action

together with the boundary condition q(t0) = q0, q(t1) = q1 yields the equation of
motion
m¨q(t) = F(q(t))
t ∈R
(6.37)
with the force F(q) = −U ′(q) = 4(a2 −q2)q. The energy
E(t) = 1
2m ˙q2(t) + U(q(t))
is constant along the trajectories q = q(t) (solutions of (6.37)). Let us discuss the
qualitative behavior of the motion of a particle governed by (6.37). Since U(q) ≥0
for all q ∈R, the energy E of the particle is always nonnegative.
• If E = 0, then ˙q(t) = 0 for all times t ∈R. Hence the particle rests either at the
point q = a or at the point q = −a.

• For ﬁxed energy E ≥0, the particle is only located at positions which belong to
the set
{q ∈R : E −U(q) ≥0}.
For example, if 0 ≤E < U(0), then the particle never passes the origin q = 0.
In contrast to this, if E > U(0), then the particle is able to pass the origin (Fig.
6.8).
Taylor expansion of the force near the point q0 yields
F(q) = −U ′(q0) −U ′′(q0)(q −q0) + o(q −q0),
q →q0,
where U ′(q) = 4(q2 −a2)q and U ′′(q) = 12q2 −4a2. The critical equation
U ′(q0) = 0
has the solutions q0 = ±a, 0. The force vanishes precisely at these equilibrium
points. Since U ′′(±a) > 0 and U ′′(0) < 0,
• the force F(q) = −U ′′(a)(q −a) + . . . is attracting near the equilibrium point
q = a,
• the force F(q) = −U ′′(−a)(q + a) + . . . is attracting near the equilibrium point
q = −a, and
• the force F(q) = −U ′′(0)q + . . . is repelling near the equilibrium point q = 0.
Consequently, the Ginzburg–Landau potential describes the motion of a particle
that has the two stable equilibrium points q = ±a and one unstable equilibrium
point q = 0. A passage from q = a to q = −a models a phase transition.
Superconductivity. The Ginzburg–Landau potential was used by Ginzburg
and Landau in 1950 in order to study phase transitions in superconductivity.15
The Higgs particle. In the Standard Model of elementary particle physics,
Weinberg introduced the ﬁeld of the so-called Higgs particle in order to generate
the large masses of the vector bosons W ±, Z0. The potential of the Higgs ﬁeld is

6.5.7 Damped Oscillations, Stability, and Energy Dissipation
The damped oscillator equation
m¨q(t) = −αq(t) −β ˙q(t),
t ∈R,
q(0) = q0, ˙q(0) = v0
(6.38)
with the positive constants α, β describes the motion of a particle on the real line
under the inﬂuence of the repulsive force −αq and the friction force −β ˙q. Typically,
friction forces depend on the velocity of the particle. Letting ω :=
p
α/m and
γ := β/2m we get the equation
¨q(t) + 2γ ˙q(t) + ω2q(t) = 0,
t ∈R,
q(0) = q0, ˙q(0) = v0.
If the friction force is suﬃciently small, 0 < γ < ω, then the unique motion is given
by
q = q0e−γt cos
“
t
p
ω2 −γ2
”
+ v0 + γq0
p
ω2 −γ2 e−γt sin
“

”
.
This corresponds to damped oscillations.
Asymptotic stability. As time goes to plus inﬁnity, the motion passes to rest
at the origin, independently of the initial position and the initial velocity:
lim
t++∞q(t) = 0.
We call this asymptotic stability of the motion.
Irreversibility. Obviously, the nontrivial process q = q(t) is irreversible; that
is, if q = q(t) is a nontrivial solution of the equation of motion (6.38), then the
time-reversed process q = q(−t) is not a solution of (6.38). Such a process would
correspond to oscillations with increasing amplitude as time goes to plus inﬁnity.
For the mechanical energy
E(t) = 1
2m ˙q(t)2 + 1
2mω2q(t)2
of the motion q = q(t), we get ˙E(t) = m¨q ˙q +mω2q ˙q, and m¨q = −mω2q −β ˙q. Hence
˙E(t) = −β ˙q(t)2 ≤0
for all times
t ≥0.
If the initial velocity does not vanish, v0 ̸= 0, then energy conservation is violated
because of ˙E(0) < 0. From the physical point of view, the mechanical energy is
partly converted into heat. Such processes are called dissipative. By the ﬁrst law of
thermodynamics, the sum of mechanical energy and heat energy is conserved.
6.5.8 Resonance and Small Divisors
We consider an harmonic oscillator with angular eigenfrequency ω under the inﬂu-
ence of an external periodic force F(t) := sin αt with the angular frequency α. This
corresponds to the following equation of motion:
m¨q(t) + mω2q(t) = sin αt,
t ∈R
q(0) = q0, ˙q(0) = v0.
(6.39)
To simplify notation, we normalize the mass by setting m := 1.

6.6 Symmetry and Conservation Laws
383
(N) Non-resonance case α ̸= ω (i.e., the angular frequency α of the external force
is diﬀerent from the angular eigenfrequency ω of the harmonic oscillator): The
unique solution of (6.39) reads as
q(t) = q0 cos ωt + v0
ω sin ωt + sin αt + sin ωt
2(α + ω)ω
−sin αt −sin ωt
2(α −ω)ω
,
t ∈R.
If the diﬀerence α −ω is small, then α −ω is called a small divisor.
(R) Resonance case α = ω (i.e., the angular frequency α of the external force is
equal to the angular eigenfrequency ω of the harmonic oscillator): The unique
solution of (6.39) reads as
q(t) = q0 cos ωt + v0
ω sin ωt + sin ωt
2ω2
−t
2ω cos ωt,
t ∈R.
The last term t cos ωt corresponds to an oscillation of angular frequency ω.
The point is that this term is dangerous as its amplitude grows without bound
as time t goes to plus inﬁnity. In real life, such resonance eﬀects can lead to
the destruction of structures (e.g., vibrations of a bridge induced by wind or
traﬃc, or vibrations of a building caused by an earthquake). The occurrence
of the dangerous resonance term t cos ωt is understandable, when one realizes
that the resonance solution (R) can be derived from the non-resonance solution
(N) by passing to the limit α →ω. In fact, the classical Bernoulli–de l’Hospital
rule for limits tells us that
lim
α→ω
sin αt −sin ωt
α −ω
= lim
α→ω t cos αt = t cos ωt.
Observe the following:
Many complicated phenomena in nature are caused by resonance eﬀects
(e.g., the chaotic motion of some asteroids in celestial mechanics or inter-
nal resonances of quantum ﬁelds).
In terms of mathematics, resonances are related to singular situations which corre-
spond to small (or zero) divisors.
6.6 Symmetry and Conservation Laws
Newton and his successors noticed that there exist conservation laws that sim-
plify the integration of the equations of motion. For example, this concerns the
conservation of the following quantities: energy, momentum, angular momentum,
Runge–Lenz vector. In 1918, Emmy Noether (1882–1935) proved a general theorem
which shows that
The symmetries of the Lagrangian are responsible for conservation laws.
For example, invariance of the Lagrangian under time translations leads to conser-
vation of energy. More general, we will show in Sec. 6.6.2 that smooth continuous
symmetries of the action integral imply conservation laws.

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
6.6.1 The Symmetries of the Harmonic Oscillator
Let q = q(t) be a solution of the harmonic oscillator equation
¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = 0,
for all
t ∈R.
(6.40)
This equation has the following symmetries.
(i) Time translation: q = q(t + t0) is a solution of (6.40) for each ﬁxed t0 ∈R.
(ii) Time reﬂection: q = q(−t) is a solution of (6.40).
(iii) Spatial reﬂection: q = −q(t) is a solution of (6.40).
(iv) Rescaling of the position: q = αq(t) is a solution of (6.40) for each ﬁxed real
number α > 0.
Summarizing, we say that the harmonic oscillator equation is invariant under time
translations, time reﬂections, spatial reﬂections, and rescaling of position.
6.6.2 The Noether Theorem
The Noether theorem is one of the most important and most beautiful theorems in
mathematical physics. To begin with, consider the Euler–Lagrange equation
d
dtL ˙q(q(t), ˙q(t), t) = Lq(q(t), ˙q(t), t)
for all
t ∈R.
(6.41)
Suppose that the Lagrangian L : R3 →R is smooth. To simplify the argument, we
assume that all the solutions q = q(t) of the equation of motion (6.41) are smooth,
and they exist for all times t ∈R. For such a solution, we deﬁne the momentum
p(t) := L ˙q(q(t), ˙q(t), t),
and the energy
E(t) := p(t) ˙q(t) −L(q(t), ˙q(t), t).
The Euler–Lagrange equation (6.41) is then equivalent to the momentum equation:
˙p(t) = Lq(q(t), ˙q(t), t)
for all
t ∈R.
(6.42)
For the time derivative of the energy function, we get the energy equation:
˙E(t) = −Lt(q(t), ˙q(t), t)
for all
t ∈R.
(6.43)
This follows from ˙E = ˙p ˙q + p¨q −Lq ˙q −L ˙q ¨q −Lt, and p = L ˙q, ˙p = Lq. From (6.42)
and (6.43), we obtain immediately the following two statements:
(i) Conservation of momentum: If the Lagrangian L = L( ˙q, t) does not depend on
position q, then p(t) = const for all times t ∈R.
(ii) Conservation of energy: If the Lagrangian L = L(q, ˙q) does not depend on time
t, then E(t) = const for all times t ∈R.
For example, choose the Lagrangian L := 1
2m ˙q2−U(q, t). The corresponding Euler–
Lagrange equation
m¨q(t) = −Uq(q(t), t)
describes the motion of a particle on the real line under the inﬂuence of the (time-
dependent) force −Uq(q, t) with the potential U. Momentum and energy are given
by p(t) := m ˙q(t) and E(t) :=
1
2m ˙q(t)2 + U(q(t), t), respectively. If the potential
U = U(q) does not depend on time, then we have the energy conservation

6.6 Symmetry and Conservation Laws
385
1
2m ˙q(t)2 + U(q(t)) = const = E0
for all
t ∈R.
Moreover, if the potential U vanishes identically, U = 0, then we get the momentum
conservation
m ˙q(t) = const = p0
for all
t ∈R.
Setting v0 := p0/m, the general solution is then given by the free motion
q = q0 + v0t
for all
t ∈R
of constant velocity v0.
Special case of the Noether theorem. We want to show that momentum
conservation is a consequence of the invariance of the action integral
SΩ[q] :=
Z
Ω
L(q(t), ˙q(t), t)dt
under spatial translations. To explain this, let us introduce the transformation
Tε : R2 →R2 by setting
Tε(t, q) := (t, q + ε)
for all
(t, q) ∈R2.
(6.44)
In particular, this transformation sends each trajectory q to a new trajectory Tεq.
Explicitly, (Tεq)(t) := q(t) + ε for all times t ∈R. Now we postulate the invariance
property
STεΩ[Tεq] = S[q]
(6.45)
of the action integral. We assume that this relation is valid for all smooth functions
q : R →R, all compact intervals Ω := [t0, t1], and all real parameters ε in some
open neighborhood of ε = 0.
Proposition 6.6 (i) The invariance of the action integral under spatial transla-
tions implies conservation of momentum for each solution of the Euler–Lagrange
equation.
(ii) The invariance of the action integral under time translations implies con-
servation of energy for each solution of the Euler–Lagrange equation.
Proof. Let f : R →R be a continuous function. If the interval Ω contracts to the
point t0, then
lim
Ω→t0

Ω
f(t)dt = f(t0).
Consequently, if
R
Ω f(t)dt = 0 for all compact intervals Ω, then f(t) = 0 for all
t ∈R.
Ad (i). (I) General trajectory q = q(t). The transformation Tε from (6.44) sends
the trajectory t 
→q(t) to t 
→q(t)+ε and leaves the time interval [t0, t1] invariant.
Thus, the invariance condition (6.45) tells us that

L(q(t) + ε, d

L(q(t), ˙q(t), t)dt

Lq(q(t), ˙q(t), t)dt = 0

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
for all intervals [t0, t1]. Hence Lq(q(t), ˙q(t), t) = 0 for all t ∈R.
(II) Motion q = q(t). If we choose a solution q = q(t) of the Euler–Lagrange
equation (6.41), then we obtain the momentum equation,
˙p(t) = Lq(q(t), ˙q(t), t),
by (6.42). Consequently, ˙p(t) = 0. This implies the desired momentum conservation,
namely, p(t) = const for all times t ∈R.
Ad (ii). (I) General trajectory q = q(t). Now we use the time translation
τ := t + ε.
Set Tε(t, q) := (t + ε, q) for all (t, q) ∈R2. For ﬁxed parameter ε, the trajectory
t 
→q(t)
is transformed into the trajectory τ 
→q(τ, ε) with q(τ, ε) := q(t). Moreover, the
time interval [t0, t1] is transformed into [t0 + ε, t1 + ε]. The invariance condition
(6.45) reads as
Z t1+ε
t0+ε
L(q(τ, ε), qτ(τ, ε), τ)dτ =
Z t1
t0
L(q(t), ˙q(t), t)dt
for all ε ∈R. Using the transformation τ = t + ε, we get
Z t1
t0
L(q(t), ˙q(t), t + ε)dt =
Z t1
t0
L(q(t), ˙q(t), t)dt.
Diﬀerentiation with respect to the real parameter ε at ε = 0 yields
Z t1
t0
Lt(q(t), ˙q(t), t)dt = 0,
and hence Lt(q(t), ˙q(t), t) = 0.
(II) Motion q = q(t). For a solution q = q(t) of the Euler-Lagrange equation
(6.41), we have the energy equation,
˙E(t) = −Lt(q(t), ˙q(t), t),
by (6.43). Hence ˙E(t) = 0. This implies energy conservation, E(t) = const for all
t ∈R.

General case of the Noether theorem. Let us now study a smooth change
τ = τ(t, ε), Q = Q(t, q, ε),
t, q ∈R
(6.46)
from time t and position q to time τ and position Q, respectively. We assume that
this transformation depends on the small real parameter ε in such a way that the
value ε = 0 corresponds to the identical transformation, that is,
t = τ(t, 0), q = Q(t, q, 0),
t, q ∈R.
We also assume that, for each value of ε in some open neighborhood of ε = 0, the
time transformation t 
→τ(t, ε) is a diﬀeomorphism from R onto itself. Naturally
enough, for ﬁxed parameter ε, the given trajectory q = q(t) is transformed into the
new trajectory q = q(τ, ε) given by

6.6 Symmetry and Conservation Laws
387
τ = τ(t, ε), q(τ(t, ε), ε) = Q(t, q(t), ε),
t ∈R.
The linearization of the transformation of trajectories with respect to the small
parameter ε reads as
τ = t + δt + o(ε),
q(τ, ε) = q(t) + δq(t) + o(ε),
ε →0.
(6.47)
Here, we set δt := ετε(t, 0) and
δq(t) := ε ∂
∂εq(τ(t, ε), ε)|ε=0.
In fact, Taylor expansion with respect to the small parameter ε yields
τ(t, ε) = τ(t, 0) + τε(t, 0)ε + o(ε),
ε →0.
Hence τ = t + δt + o(ε). Similarly, we get q(τ(t, ε), ε) = q(t) + δq(t) + o(ε). To
streamline the notation, let us denote the smooth transformation (6.46) by
Tε : R2 →R2,
that is, Tε(t, q) = (τ, Q). In 1918, the following famous theorem was proven by
Emmy Noether.16
Theorem 6.7 Suppose that the action integral SΩ[q] :=
Z
Ω
L(q(t), ˙q(t), t)dt has
the invariance property
STεΩ[Tεq] = SΩ[q]
(6.48)
for all smooth trajectories q = q(t) on R, all compact time intervals Ω, and all
real parameters ε in some open neighborhood of ε = 0. Then each smooth solution
q = q(t) of the Euler-Lagrange equation

d
dt (Lδt + (δq −˙qδt)L ˙q) = 0
for all

(6.49)
Before proving this, let us make some comments.

for all

where P := (q(t), ˙q(t), t). This holds for all ε ∈R. Note that δt and δq linearly
depend on ε. The invariance condition (6.48) for the action integral can be replaced
by the following local symmetry condition

We assume that this is true for all times t ∈R, all smooth trajectories q = q(t) on
R, and all real parameters ε in some open neighborhood of ε = 0. The proof to be
given below shows that

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
The Noether theorem remains valid if we use trajectories q = q(t) with
n degrees of freedom, that is, we have q(t) ∈Rn for all t ∈R, where17
n = 1, 2, . . .
The point is that we will carry out the proof below in such a way that it can be gen-
eralized immediately to variational problems for multi-dimensional integrals. This
will be considered in Vol. III in connection with the investigation of physical ﬁeld
theories (e.g., the theory of general relativity, the Standard Model in elementary
particle physics, and the string theory). In particular, we will show that the energy-
momentum tensor for physical ﬁelds follows from the relativistic invariance of the
action integral together with the Noether theorem.
Example. For the motion q = q(t) on the real line, the conservation law (6.49)
reads as
d

`
p(t)δq(t) −E(t)δt
´
= 0
for all
t ∈R.
(6.51)
(i) Conservation of momentum: For the translation of position,
τ = t, Q = q + ε,
we obtain δt = 0 and δq = ε, by (6.47). Then q(τ, ε) = q(t)+ε. If the Lagrangian
L = L(q, ˙q, t) does not depend on position q, then
L(q(t) + ε, ˙q(t), t) = L(q(t), ˙q(t), t)
for all
t, ε ∈R.
This is the local symmetry condition (6.50). By (6.51), ε ˙p(t) = 0 for all t, ε.
Hence p(t) = const for all t ∈R.
(ii) Conservation of energy: For the time translation
τ = t + ε, Q = q,
we get δt = ε and δq = 0, by (6.47). Then q(τ, ε) = q(t). If the given Lagrangian
L = L(q, ˙q, t) does not depend on time t, then
L(q(t), ˙q(t), t + ε) = L(q(t), ˙q(t), t)
for all
t, ε ∈R.
This is the local symmetry condition (6.50). By (6.51), ε ˙E(t) = 0 for all t, ε.
Hence E(t) = const for all t ∈R.
Proof of Theorem 6.7. In what follows, the primed quantity q′ denotes the
derivative of the function q = q(t) with respect to time t.

which coincides with (6.50). Since τ(t, 0) = t and q(t, 0) = q(t), we get
τt(t, 0) = 1,
qτ(t, 0) = q′(t),
qττ(t, 0) = q′′(t).

eter ε at ε = 0, the chain rule yields
Lq(P)
`
qτ(t, 0)τε(t, 0) + qε(t, 0)
´
τt(t, 0)

`
qττ(t, 0)τε(t, 0) + qετ(t, 0) + Lt(P)τε(t, 0)
´
τt(t, 0)
+L(P)τεt(t, 0) = 0.
Here, we set P :=
`
q(t), q′(t), t
´
. Introducing α(t) := εqε(t, 0), we obtain
Lq(P)(q′δt + α) + Lq′(P)(q′′δt + α′) + Lt(P)δt + L(P)(δt)′ = 0.
Setting L′(t) :=
d
dtL(P), the chain rule tells us that
L′ = Lqq′ + Lq′q′′ + Lt.
This implies the following equation
L′δt + Lqα + Lq′α′ + L(δt)′ = 0.
(6.53)
Explicitly, L′(P)δt + Lq(P)α(t) + Lq′(P)α′(t) + L(P)(δt)′(t) = 0. To compute the
function α = α(t), diﬀerentiate q(τ(t, ε), ε) with respect to the parameter ε at ε = 0.
Then
δq(t) = εqτ(τ(t, 0), 0)τε(t, 0) + εqε(τ(t, 0), 0).
Noting that τ(t, 0) = t, we get
δq(t) = q′(t)δt + α(t).
Now the key relation (6.53) reads as
L′δt + L(δt)′ + Lq(δq −q′δt) + Lq′(δq −q′δt)′ = 0.
(6.54)
This is valid for each trajectory q = q(t).
(II) Motion. Now consider the special case where the trajectory q = q(t) satisﬁes
the Euler-Lagrange equation. Then
(Lq′(P))′ = Lq(P).
Therefore, using the product rule, the key relation (6.54) passes over to the equation
(Lδt)′ + (Lq′ `
δq −q′δt)
´′ = 0.
This is the desired conservation law (6.49).

6.7 The Pendulum and Dynamical Systems
Henri Poincar´e (1854–1912) originated not only new theories, but com-
pletely new branches of mathematics like the theory of dynamical sys-
tems, diﬀerential topology, and algebraic topology. His ideas are so great,
his way of thinking of and looking at mathematical reality has been so
widely accepted that to us, his descendants, it seems strange that people
have thought diﬀerently, for example, that dynamical systems should be
considered on manifolds, and not only on Rn – because indeed a plane
pendulum is a motion on the circle, and a spherical pendulum is a motion
on a sphere.18
Krysztof Maurin, 1999
Motions of mass point systems are frequently governed by constraints (e.g., the
oscillations of molecules). Whereas the free motion of N mass points in Euclidean
space has 3N degrees of freedom, constrained motions possess less than 3N degrees
of freedom. The Lagrangian approach to mechanics allows an elegant reduction to
the true number of degrees of freedom by considering the motion with respect to
appropriately chosen local coordinates. This corresponds to the theory of dynamical
systems on manifolds. In order to illustrate this, let us consider the motion x = x(t)
of a pendulum of mass m and length l.
In a right-handed Cartesian coordinate system, we set x = xi + yj + zk (Fig.
6.9). The gravitational force
F = −mgk
acts on a particle of mass m. Here, g = 9.81m/s2 is the acceleration of gravity.
Letting U(x) := mgz, we get F = −grad U. Therefore, the force F has the
potential U.
6.7.1 The Equation of Motion
For the Lagrangian, we get
L := kinetic energy minus potential energy = 1
2m ˙x2 −U(x).

x(t0) = x0, x(t1) = x1,
together with the side condition x(t)2 = l2 for all times t ∈[t0, t1]. The side
condition tells us that the motion proceeds on a circle of radius l. In order to
eliminate the side condition, we make the ansatz
x(t) = l(sin ϕ(t) i −cos ϕ(t) k),
where ϕ denotes the elongation angle (Fig. 6.9). For the velocity vector, we then
get ˙x(t) = l(cos ϕ(t) i + sin ϕ(t) k) ˙ϕ(t). Therefore, the principle of critical action

called the one-dimensional sin-Gordon equation. Let us study the situation where
the pendulum rests at the initial time t0 := 0. Then we have to add the initial

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
It turns out that this problem leads to the theory of elliptic integrals and elliptic
functions created by Euler, Gauss, Legendre, Jacobi, Riemann, and Weierstrass in
the 18th and 19th century. We will show that

For ψ = π
2 , Legendre introduced the symbol K(k) := F( π

to x = F(ψ; k) is called the amplitudinis function, ψ = am (x; k). Moreover, the
function
y = sin am(x; k)
is called the sinus amplitudinis function. This Jacobian sinus function is also de-
noted by y = sn(x; k). Analytic continuation of this function yields a meromorphic
function on the complex plane, which is double-periodic (i.e., elliptic) with the real
period 4K(k) and the imaginary period 2K(
√
1 −k2)i. In the limit case k = 0, we
get the classical sinus function,
sin am(x; 0) = sin x

Proof. (I) Energy conservation. Recall that ω :=

(6.55), then
1
2ml2 ˙ϕ(t)2 −mgl cos ϕ(t) = const = E
for all
t ∈R.
(6.58)
In fact, diﬀerentiation with respect to time t yields ml2 ¨ϕ + mgl sin ϕ = 0. Here,
E = 1
2m ˙x2 + U(x) equals the total energy. Equation (6.58) describes conservation
of energy. The initial condition ϕ(0) = ϕ0, ˙ϕ(0) = 0 tells us that E = −mgl cos ϕ0.
Using the identity cos ϕ = 1 −2 sin2 ϕ

The constant follows from the initial condition t(ϕ0) = 0.
(II) Legendre’s normal form. We want to transform the elliptic integral (6.59)
into F(ψ; k). To this end, we introduce the new parameter ψ by letting
sin ϕ
2 = k sin ψ,
−π

In particular, we assume that ψ = π/2 corresponds to ϕ = ϕ0. Note that

By the initial condition t( π

fore, ψ = am (ωt + K(k); k), and hence we obtain the desired motion (6.57) of the
pendulum.
(III) Approximation. If the maximal angle ϕ0 is small, then the parameter k is
also small. In ﬁrst order, as k →0,
sin ϕ
2 = k sin am (ωt + K(0); 0) + o(k) = k sin

+ o(k).
Hence sin ϕ
2 = k cos ωt. If t = 0, then sin ϕ0
2 = k. Finally, from sin ϕ = ϕ + ... we
obtain the approximative solution ϕ = ϕ0 cos ωt, which coincides with (6.56).

The Jacobi theta functions. Fix a complex number τ with positive imaginary
part, that is, ℑ(τ) > 0. For each complex number z and each parameter q := eiπτ,

Gauss’ lemniscatic sinus function. Jakob Bernoulli (1654–1705) introduced
the curve
(x2 + y2)2 −(x2 −y2)2 = 0,
(x, y) ∈R2
(6.60)
in the Leipzig Acta eruditorum (journal of scientists) in 1694. This is an algebraic
curve of fourth order called the lemniscate. This curve is obtained in the following
way. Start with the hyperbola
x2 −y2 = 1.
Using polar coordinates x = r cos ϕ, y = r sin ϕ, x2 −y2 = r2 cos 2ϕ = 1. Hence

sl(z + l) = sl z
sl(z + li) = sl z
for all

That is, M(a0, b0) = limn→∞an = limn→∞bn.
Bernoulli’s lemniscate was one of the starting points of algebraic geometry.
The essential step was made by Riemann (1826–1866) who noticed that algebraic
curves in the plane R2 can be understood best by extending them to complex values.
This way we obtain a curve in the complex space C2 which can be described by a
compact Riemann surface of real dimension two (and complex dimension one). For
the theory of elliptic functions, we refer to:

Elliptic Integrals, Springer, Berlin, 1964 (in German).

6.7.3 The Phase Space of the Pendulum and Bundles
It was a great achievement of Poincar´e (1854–1912) to show that the proper
domain of analytic dynamics is the cotangent bundle TM d of the position
space M – this discovery was so fundamental that nowadays it seems to
be natural and obvious.20
Krysztof Maurin, 1996
The categories of diﬀerentiable manifolds and vector bundles provide a
useful context for the mathematics needed in mechanics, especially the
new topological and qualitative results.21
Ralph Abraham and Jerrold Marsden, 1978
Too often in the physical sciences, the space of states is postulated to be a
linear space when the basic problem is essentially nonlinear; this confuses
the mathematical development.22
Stephen Smale, 1980
This section should help the reader to understand the intuitive roots of the language
of bundle theory in modern mathematics and physics. In mechanics, one has to
distinguish the following crucial notions:
• position space M;
• state space TM (tangent bundle of the manifold M);
• phase space TM d (cotangent bundle of M).
Let us discuss this for the prototype of a mechanical system with nontrivial topology
– the circular pendulum.
Our strategy is to introduce only such quantities which have a geometrical
meaning, that is, they are independent of the choice of local coordinates.
The position space. The position of the circular pendulum is described by a
point P of the circle S1
R of radius R. We set
M := S1
R.
This is the set of all positions. Naturally enough, the circle M is called the position
space of the pendulum.
The tangent space. By deﬁnition, the symbol
TP M
denotes the tangent space of the circle M at the point P. In terms of physics, the
vector v is contained in the tangent space TP M iﬀthere exists a motion x = x(t)
on the circle M such that, at time t = 0, the particle is at the point P and has the
velocity vector
˙x(0) = v.
The motion of the particle on the circle M is uniquely determined by knowing the
tuple (P, v) at the initial time t = 0. Here, P is the initial position, and v is the
initial velocity vector (Fig. 6.11(a)). Let x = x(t) be the counter-clockwise motion

Fig. 6.11. The tangent bundle of the pendulum
of a particle on the circle M with angular velocity one. Set e := ˙x(t). This way,
we obtain a unit tangent vector eP at each point P of the circle. Moreover, the
velocity vectors v ∈TP M can be uniquely represented as
v = v · eP ,
v ∈R.
The real number v is called the coordinate of the velocity vector v at the point P.
The state space (tangent bundle). All the tuples (P, v) are called states of
the particle. The set of all possible states
TM := {(P, v) :
P ∈M, v ∈TP M}
is called the state space of the pendulum. In mathematics, TM is called the tangent
bundle of the circle M. For ﬁxed P, the set
FP := {(P, v) : v ∈TP M}
is called a ﬁber of TM with respect to the base point P. This ﬁber can be identiﬁed
with the tangent space TP M at the point P. The Lagrangian of the pendulum can
be written as
L(P, v) = 1
2mv2 −U(P)
where 1
2mv2 is the kinetic energy, and U(P) is the potential energy of the pendulum
at the point P of the circle M. Consequently, the Lagrangian
L : TM →R
is a real-valued function on the state space TM (tangent bundle of the position space
M). In order to get an intuitive geometric interpretation of the tangent bundle TM,
let us assign to the vector v the coordinate v. The map
(P, v) 
→(P, v)
is a bijection from TM onto the product set M × R. In terms of geometry, the
product set can be regarded as a cylindrical surface with the circle M as equator.
The ﬁbers {(P, v) : v ∈R} of the cylindrical surface are generating straight lines
perpendicular to the equator.
The motion x = x(t) of the circular pendulum corresponds to a curve C
in the tangent bundle TM (Fig. 6.11(b)).

398
6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
From the point of view of the theory of bundles, product bundles like M × R are
trivial. For general mechanical systems, as a rule, the tangent bundle is not a trivial
product, but it is obtained by gluing together local products.
This gluing procedure generates nontrivial topological properties.
The tangent bundle TM can be synonymously written as the coproduct (or disjoint
union) of all the tangent spaces TMP of the base manifold M:
TM =
a
P ∈M
TP M.
One also writes TM = {TP M}P ∈M (bundle of the tangent spaces).
Duality and the costate space (phase space). Duality plays a crucial role
in mathematics in order to substantially simplify investigations. Let us dualize the
concept of the tangent bundle. To begin with, deﬁne the diﬀerential form dϕP at
the point P by setting
dϕP (v) = v
for all
v ∈TP M.
In particular, dϕP (eP ) = 1. In terms of physics, the linear functional
dϕP : TP M →R
describes a special measurement process, which assigns to the velocity vector v the
real number v (velocity component). By deﬁnition, the dual tangent space (TP M)d
consists of all linear functionals F : TP M →R. The elements of (TP M)d are called
cotangent vectors (or covelocity vectors), and (TP M)d itself is called the cotangent
space of the circle M at the point P. Each cotangent vector F ∈(TP M)d can be
represented by
F = p · dϕP .
The real number p is called the coordinate of F at the point P. Then
F(v) = F(veP ) = v · dϕP (eP ) = vp.
The tuple (P, F) is called a costate. The set of costates
TM d := {(P, F) :
P ∈M, F ∈(TP M)d}
is called the costate space (or the phase space) of the pendulum. In mathematics,
TM is called the cotangent bundle of the circle M. Assigning the coordinate p to
the covector F, the map
(P, F) 
→(P, p)
is a bijection from TM d onto the product set M × R. Using the notion of disjoint
union, the cotangent bundle can be synonymously written as
TM d =
a
P ∈M
(TP M)d.
One also writes TM d = {(TP M)d}P ∈M (bundle of the dual tangent spaces). As we
will show later on, there exists a quite natural diﬀeomorphism
L : TM →TM d

from the tangent bundle TM onto the cotangent bundle TM d of the position space
(manifold) M. This diﬀeomorphism L is called Legendre transformation, which is
a contact transformation in the sense of Sophus Lie.
Local coordinates. By deﬁnition, an n-dimensional manifold looks locally like
an open set in Rn; the points in Rn represent local coordinates of the manifold.23
In this setting, the angle variable ϕ is not an admissible coordinate for the global
circle. In fact, it is impossible to map homeomorphically the circle M onto an open
subset Ω of the real line R, since the ﬁrst Betti numbers are diﬀerent. Explicitly,
we have β1(M) = 1 and β1(Ω) = 0. In fact, for the circle, we need at least two
local coordinate systems with coordinates denoted by ϕ and ψ (Fig. 6.12(b)). For
example,
• ϕ varies in the open interval ] −π, π[;
• ψ varies in the open interval, say, ]π −π
4 , π + π
4 [ ;
• the point (x, y) = (R, 0) on the circle has the local coordinate ϕ = 0, and the
point (−R, 0) on the circle has the local coordinate ψ = π.
It is the goal of the analysis on manifolds to introduce such quantities which do
not depend on the choice of local coordinates. Such properties possess an invariant
geometric (or physical) meaning. This will be thoroughly studied in Vol. III. The
general theory of invariants is a vivid branch of mathematics with many applications
to physics; it was created by Cayley (1821–1895), and further developed by Weyl
(1885–1955). We refer to:
H. Weyl, The Classical Groups: Their Invariants and Representations,
Princeton University Press, 1946.
P. Olver, Classical Invariant Theory, Cambridge University Press, 1999.
The covering space of the position space. The true topological character
of the global angle variable ϕ becomes clear if we consider the surjective map
χ : R →M given by
χ(ϕ) := Reiϕ
for all
ϕ ∈R.
(6.62)
This is called a covering map of the circle M, and the real line R is called a covering
space of M (Fig. 6.13). Since the real line is simply connected, it is called a universal
covering space of the circle M. The map χ is smooth and has the period 2π.
A deep mathematical result tells us that all Lie groups and all compact
Riemann surfaces have universal covering spaces.

spaces and homeomorphisms can be found in Sects. 5.4ﬀof Vol. I.

Equivalently, this tells us that there exist global parametrizations of algebraic
curves, by the famous 1907 uniformization theorem due to Koebe (1882–1945) and
Poincar´e (1854–1912). For example, elliptic functions are global parametrizations
of elliptic curves. As an introduction to uniformization, we recommend:

The position space as a Lie group. Choose R = 1, that is, the pendulum
has the length one. Then the position space M can be identiﬁed with the Lie group
U(1) := {z ∈C : |z| = 1}.
Note that the elements of U(1) can be represented by z = eϕi with ϕ ∈R.
The additive (simply connected) Lie group R is called the universal covering
group of the Lie group U(1) (Fig 6.13). In a Cartesian (x, y)-coordinate system with
the right-handed orthonormal basis i, j, the tangent space of the unit circle U(1) at
the unit element 1 is given by
T1U(1) = {vj :
v ∈R}.
By deﬁnition, this tangent space is called the Lie algebra u(1) of the Lie group
U(1). In terms of complex numbers, this can be written as
u(1) = {vi :
v ∈R}.
This is the space of purely imaginary numbers. The passage
U(1) ⇒u(1)
(6.63)
from the Lie group U(1) to the Lie algebra u(1) is given by the Taylor expansion
eϕi = 1 + ϕi + o(ϕ),
ϕ →0.
Therefore, the passage (6.63) from the Lie group to the Lie algebra is nothing else
than an application of the linearization principle to Lie groups.

First-order diﬀerential operators. Let C∞(M) be the space of all smooth
2π-periodic functions f : R →R. These functions can be regarded as smooth
functions on the circle M. By deﬁnition, a ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operator
D : C∞(M) →C∞(M)
on the circle M has the form
D := v(ϕ) d
dϕ,
ϕ ∈R
with the ﬁxed function v ∈C∞(M). Explicitly, for all f ∈C∞(M), we get
(Df)(ϕ) = v(ϕ)df(ϕ)
dϕ ,
ϕ ∈R.
Furthermore, let Vec(M) denote the space of all smooth velocity vector ﬁelds v on
the circle M. Explicitly, the velocity vector ﬁeld v is given by
v(ϕ)eP (ϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈R,
where v ∈C∞(M). Deﬁne
v[f] := Df
for all
f ∈C∞(M).
(6.64)
This way, we obtain a one-to-one map
v 
→D
between the smooth velocity vector ﬁelds v on the circle M and the ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential operators D on M (with smooth coeﬃcients). The identiﬁcation v 
→D
between velocity vector ﬁelds and ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators dates back to
Sophus Lie (1842–1899); it is frequently used in the modern mathematical literature
on ﬁnite-dimensional manifolds. However, such an identiﬁcation does not exist on
inﬁnite-dimensional manifolds. Therefore, in this series of monographs, we will use
an approach to velocity vectors on manifolds which ﬁts both the ﬁnite-dimensional
case and the inﬁnite-dimensional case.
Sections and physical ﬁelds. We want to show that the modern notion of
the section of a bundle comprehends
• vector ﬁelds on M (sections of the tangent bundle TM),
• ﬁrst-order diﬀerential operators (sections of the tangent bundle TM),
• diﬀerential forms on M (sections of the cotangent bundle TM d).
The map
s : M →TM
(6.65)
given by s(P) := v(P) with v(P) ∈TP M is called a section of the tangent bundle
TM. In terms of physics, this is a velocity ﬁeld
P 
→v(P)
on the circle M. We will show in Vol. III that physical ﬁelds are sections of vec-
tor bundles or sections of more general ﬁber bundles (vector ﬁelds, tensor ﬁelds,
spinor ﬁelds, and so on). If we identify the velocity vector ﬁeld v = v(P) with the

402
6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
diﬀerential operator D, then the section (6.65) equivalently describes a ﬁrst-order
diﬀerential operator P →v(P) d
ϕ on the circle. Dually, the map
s : M →TM d
(6.66)
given by s(P) := FP with FP ∈TP M is called a section of the cotangent bundle
TM d. This is a diﬀerential form P 
→p(P)dϕP on the circle M.
The notion of section generalizes the notion of function in classical anal-
ysis.
In fact, the real function f : R →R can be identiﬁed with the map
s : R →TR
given by s(x) := (x, f(x)). Here, the tangent bundle of the real line R is deﬁned by
TR := {(x, v) : x ∈R, v ∈R}.
In other words, TR = R2. The map s is a section of the tangent bundle TR of the
real line.
Perspective. For a general mechanical system of n degrees of freedom with
n = 1, 2, . . ., the following hold:
• the position space M is a real n-dimensional manifold,
• the state space TM (tangent bundle of M) is a 2n-dimensional manifold, and
• the phase space TM d (cotangent bundle) is a 2n-dimensional symplectic mani-
fold.
The Lagrangian formulation of mechanics is based on the Lagrangian
L : TM →R,
whereas the dual Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics is based on the Hamiltonian
H : TM d →R,
which represents the energy function of the mechanical system, as a rule. In contrast
to the cotangent bundle TM d, the tangent bundle TM is not always a symplectic
manifold. Therefore, the Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics has advantages over
the Lagrangian formulation. In statistical mechanics, the Hamiltonian approach will
allow us to use the volume measure of the phase space in order to construct the key
probability measure (see Sect. 7.17.5 on page 645). Summarizing, the language of
manifolds allows us to study the global aspects of the motion of mechanical systems.
The complexity of a mechanical system is reﬂected by the complex topology
of the tangent bundle and the cotangent bundle.
6.8 Hamiltonian Mechanics
The Hamiltonian approach to mechanics is centered at the concept of energy. In
this setting, the following two important results are quite natural:
• Conservation of energy, and
• conservation of phase volume.

6.8 Hamiltonian Mechanics
403
The latter property is crucial for classical statistical physics (Gibbs measure). From
the geometric point of view, the passage from Lagrangian mechanics to Hamiltonian
mechanics corresponds to a passage
• from the tangent bundle TM of the position space M (position, velocity vector)
• to the dual cotangent bundle TM d of M (position, diﬀerential form).
This transformation is called the Legendre transformation which is a contact trans-
formation in the sense of Lie. The cotangent bundle TM d always carries a natural
symplectic structure. Note the following:
• Lagrangian mechanics corresponds to Riemannian geometry (the metric is given
by the kinetic energy).
• Hamiltonian mechanics corresponds to symplectic geometry.
One of the great problems of mathematics and physics in the 19th century consisted
in solving the N-body problem in celestial mechanics.
The aim was to investigate the stability of our solar system.
To simplify considerations, Jacobi and his successors used transformations of time
and position which preserve the form of the canonical equations.
Such transformations are called canonical transformations.
It turns out that canonical transformations coincide with symplectic transforma-
tions. That is, canonical transformations preserve the symplectic structure, and
hence they present the symmetry transformations of symplectic geometry. When
creating his mechanics, Hamilton (1805–1865) was motivated by an analogy be-
tween mechanics and Huygens’ geometrical optics created in the 17th century:
• The trajectories q = q(t), p = p(t) of a particle in mechanics correspond to light
rays (solutions of the canonical ordinary diﬀerential equations), and
• the action function S = S(q, t) in mechanics corresponds to the eikonal function
in geometric optics, which determines the wave fronts (solutions of the Hamilton–
Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation).
• The duality between trajectories and wave fronts was fully established by
Carath´eodory in the framework of his ’royal road to the calculus of variations’
in 1925. This is based on the fundamental notion of geodesic ﬁelds.
The relation between geometric optics and wave optics plays a fundamental role
for understanding Schr¨odinger’s quantum mechanics which he discovered in 1926.
In the 1950s, optimal control theory was invented independently by Bellman and
Pontryagin. This theory allows many applications in technology (e.g., moon landing
and return of a spaceship to earth):
• Pontryagin’s theory generalizes Hamilton’s canonical equations (Pontryagin’s
maximum principle and light rays), whereas
• Bellman’s theory of dynamic programming generalizes the Hamilton–Jacobi par-
tial equation (the Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation and wave fronts).
In the Bellman approach, the action function S corresponds to the cost function.
A detailed study can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. III (see the references on
page 1049). In what follows, let us study the main ideas on an elementary level by
considering the harmonic oscillator as a prototype.

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
6.8.1 The Canonical Equation
In Hamiltonian mechanics, we pass from position and velocity to position
and momentum.
Folklore
The Newtonian equation m¨q = −mω2q for the motion of the harmonic oscillator
can be written as a ﬁrst order system
˙q = p
m,
˙p = −mω2q.
(6.67)
Here, the variable p is called momentum. Introducing the so-called Hamiltonian
H(q, p) := p2
2m + mω2q2
2
,
equation (6.67) is identical with the so-called canonical equation
˙q = Hp,
˙p = −Hq.
(6.68)
Explicitly, for all times t ∈R,
˙q(t) = Hp(q(t), p(t)),
˙p(t) = −Hq(q(t), p(t)).
Note that H represents the energy function of the harmonic oscillator. In terms of
the Lagrangian
L = m ˙q2
2
−mω2q2
2
,
we obtain
p = L ˙q,
H = p ˙q −L.
The transformation from the variables q, ˙q to q, p and from the Lagrangian
L = L(q, ˙q)
to the Hamiltonian H = H(q, p) is called Legendre transformation.
6.8.2 The Hamiltonian Flow
The Hamiltonian formulation (6.68) possesses the advantage over the Newtonian
formulation that we can apply the well-elaborated methods of the theory of dy-
namical systems to mechanics. Let us consider this. The unique solution of the
initial-value problem
q(0) = q0,
p(0) = p0
to the canonical equation (6.67) is given by
q(t) := q0 cos ωt + p0
mω sin ωt,
(6.69)
p(t) := −mωq0 sin ωt + p0 cos ωt.
Deﬁne
Ft(q0, p0) := (q(t), p(t)),
t ∈R.
This way, we get a ﬂow on the phase space {(q, p) ∈R2} which is called the
Hamiltonian ﬂow corresponding to H (Fig. 6.14). The trajectories are ellipses. The
ﬂow transports the point (q0, p0) at time t = 0 to the point (q(t), p(t)) at time t.
The ﬂow can be interpreted as
• the motion of ﬂuid particles, or
• the propagation of light rays.24
24 In the case of light rays, the symbol t denotes a curve parameter, but not time.

6.8.3 The Hamilton–Jacobi Partial Diﬀerential Equation
The action. The quantity
S[q] :=
Z t1
t0
L(q(t), ˙q(t)) dt
is called the action along the trajectory q = q(t), a ≤t ≤b. The action is the most
fundamental quantity in physics. Let us study the action along trajectories of the
harmonic oscillator. For given real values T, Q, consider the following boundary-
value problem for the Newtonian equation
m¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = 0,
t ∈R,
(6.70)
q(0) = 0,
q(T) = Q.
To simplify notation, let m = ω = 1. If 0 < T < π, problem (6.70) has the unique
solution
q = v sin t,
v :=
Q
sin T .
(6.71)
Varying the parameters T, Q, we obtain a family of trajectories through the origin
(Fig. 6.15(a)). The action along the trajectory (6.71) is given by
S(T, Q) :=
Z T

we obtain

This implies the so-called Hamilton–Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation
ST (T, Q) + H(Q, SQ(T, Q)) = 0.
(6.72)
Focal points. If Q = 0 and T = π, the trajectory from (6.70), (6.71) is not
uniquely determined by the boundary condition. Each function q(t) := v sin t, t ∈R
satisﬁes the condition q(π) = 0. In this critical case, a focal point occurs (Fig.
6.15(b)). In fact, the action S(T, Q) = 1
2Q2 cot T is singular at the point T = π.
Such singularities are responsible for typical diﬃculties which arise in the theory of
the Hamilton–Jacobi equation. In geometric optics, such singularities correspond
to focal points and caustics of lenses, which are caused by the intersection and the
envelops of families of light rays, respectively.
6.9 Poissonian Mechanics
The Poissonian formulation of mechanics has the following two advantages:
• Conservation laws can be expressed in terms of Poisson brackets.25
• Quantum mechanics can be obtained from classical mechanics by replacing the
Poisson bracket {A, B} with the commutator
1
iℏ· [A, B]−
where the Lie bracket [A, B]−is equal to AB−BA. This was implicitly discovered
by Heisenberg in 1925. The general quantization rule was formulated by Dirac
in 1926.

6.9.1 Poisson Brackets and the Equation of Motion
Consider the space C∞(R2) of smooth real functions F = F(q, p). Deﬁne the Poisson
bracket
{A, B} := AqBp −BqAp,
where Aq = ∂A/∂q, and so on. In particular,
{q, p} = 1,
{q, q} = {p, p} = 0.
Let q = q(t), p = p(t) be the motion of a particle which satisﬁes the canonical
equations
˙p = −Hq,
˙q = Hp
for a given Hamiltonian H = H(q, p). Then
˙F = {F, H}
(6.73)
for each F ∈C∞(R2). Explicitly,
dF
dt (q(t), p(t)) = {F, H}(q(t), p(t)).
In fact, dF
dt = Fq ˙q + Fp ˙p = FqHp −FpHq = {F, H}.
6.9.2 Conservation Laws
Proposition 6.10 If {F, H} ≡0, then F is a conserved quantity.
Proof. By (6.73),
d
dtF(q(t), p(t)) = 0. Hence F(q(t), p(t)) = const for all t.
2
For example, the Hamiltonian H is a conserved quantity, since obviously
{H, H} = 0. This corresponds to conservation of energy.
The space C∞(R2) forms a real Lie algebra with respect to the Poisson
brackets.
Proof. For all functions A, B, C ∈C∞(R2) and all real numbers α and β, we have
to show that:
(i) {A, B} = −{B, A},
(ii) {αA + βB, C} = α{A, C} + β{B, C},
(iii) {A, {B, C}} + {B, {C, A}} + {C, {A, B}} = 0 (Jacobi identity).
For example, {A, B} = AqBp−BqAp = −{B, A}. Similarly, we get the other claims.
2
If A and B are conserved quantities, then so is {A, B}.
Proof. Set C := {A, B}. By the Jacobi identity, {H, A} = {H, B} = 0 implies
{H, C} = {H, {A, B}} = −{A, {B, H}} −{B, {H, A}} = 0.

6.10 Symplectic Geometry
A deeper understanding of classical mechanics is based on symplectic geometry.
By deﬁnition, a quantity belongs to symplectic geometry iﬀit is invariant under
symplectic transformations. Let us explain the basic ideas.

408
6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
6.10.1 The Canonical Equations
Set q(t) := (q(t), p(t)) and ˙q(t) := ( ˙q(t), ˙p(t)). We want to consider the motion
q = q(t), p = p(t) of a particle which satisﬁes the canonical equations
˙p(t) = −Hq(q(t)),
˙q(t) = Hp(q(t)).
(6.74)
Using the language of diﬀerential forms, this equation can elegantly be written as
˙q ⌋ω = dH
(6.75)
along the trajectory q = q(t), where
ω := dq ∧dp
is called the symplectic form of R2. To show this, recall the deﬁnitions
dq(w) := a
and
dp(w) := b
for all w = (a, b) in R2. Furthermore,
(dq ∧dp)(v, w) := dq(v)dp(w) −dq(w)dp(v)
for all v, w ∈R2. Finally, the inner product v ⌋ω is deﬁned by
(v ⌋ω)(w) := ω(v, w).
It follows from dH = Hq(q(t)) dq + Hp(q(t)) dp that
dH(w) = Hq(q(t)) a + Hp(q(t)) b.
On the other hand,
(˙q ⌋ω)(w) := (dq ∧dp)(˙q, w) = dq(˙q)dp(w) −dq(w)dp(˙q).
Thus, the equation
(˙q ⌋ω)(w) = dH(w)
for all w = (a, b) in R2 is equivalent to
˙q(t)b −˙p(t)a = Hq(q(t)) a + Hp(q(t)) b
for all
a, b ∈R.
In turn, this is equivalent to the canonical equations (6.74).
Proposition 6.11 For all A, B ∈C∞(R2),
dA ∧dB = {A, B} dq ∧dp.
Proof. Note that dq ∧dq = dp ∧dp = 0. Therefore, it follows from
dA = Aqdq + Apdp
and
dB = Bqdq + Bpdp
that dA ∧dB = (AqBp −BqAp) dq ∧dp. This completes the proof.

6.10 Symplectic Geometry
409
6.10.2 Symplectic Transformations
Consider a diﬀeomorphism
Q = Q(q, p),
P = P(q, p),
(q, p) ∈Ω
(6.76)
from an open set Ω in R2 onto another open set in R2. Such a diﬀeomorphism is
called a symplectic transformation iﬀ
dQ ∧dP = dq ∧dp
on Ω.
This is equivalent to the condition
∂(Q, P)
∂(q, p) ≡1
on Ω.
That is, each symplectic transformation is volume preserving. In fact, this follows
from
dQ ∧dP = {Q, P} dq ∧dp
along with {Q, P} = ∂(Q, P)/∂(q, p).
Proposition 6.12 Poisson brackets are invariant under symplectic transforma-
tions.
Proof. Deﬁne the transformed functions
A(Q, P) := A(q, p)
and
B(Q, P) := B(q, p),
where (q, p) and (Q, P) are related to each other through (6.76). Then
dA ∧dB = {A, B} dq ∧dp
and
dA ∧dB = {A, B} dQ ∧dP.
Since the ∧-product is invariant under diﬀeomorphisms,
dA ∧dB = dA ∧dB.
Therefore, dQ ∧dP = dq ∧dp implies {A, B}(q, p) = {A, B}(Q, P).
2
Proposition 6.13 Symplectic transformations preserve the structure of the Hamil-
tonian canonical equations.
In classical mechanics, such transformations are called canonical transforma-
tions. They were introduced by Jacobi in order to simplify the solution of compli-
cated problems in celestial mechanics.26
Proof. We are given the Hamiltonian H = H(q, p). The canonical equations
˙q = Hp,
˙p = −Hp
can be written as
˙q = {q, H},
˙p = {p, H}.
For the transformed motion Q(t) := Q(q(t), p(t)), P(t) := P(q(t), p(t)), we get
26 The classical theory of canonical transformations can be found in C. Cara-
th´eodory, Calculus of Variations and Partial Diﬀerential Equations of First Or-
der, Chap. 6, Chelsea, New York, 1982.

410
6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
˙Q = Qq ˙q + Qp ˙p = QqHp −QpHq.
Hence
˙Q = {Q, H},
˙P = {P, H}.
Deﬁne the transformed Hamiltonian H(Q, P) := H(q, p). By Prop. 6.12 above, we
obtain
˙Q = {Q, H},
˙P = {P, H}.
Hence ˙Q = HP , ˙P = −HQ.
2
Now consider the trajectories
q = q(t; Q, P),
p = p(t; Q, P)
(6.77)
of the canonical equations with respect to the Hamiltonian H = H(q, p) together
with the initial conditions q(0) = Q, p(0) = P. Deﬁne
Ft(Q, P) := (q(t), p(t)).
This way, for each time t, we get a transformation (Q, P) 
→(q(t), p(t)).
Theorem 6.14 The ﬂow operator Ft is symplectic for each time t.
Proof. We have to show that
∂(q, p)
∂(Q, P) = 1
for all
t,
where q and p are given through (6.77). This is identical with
{p, q}(Q, P) = 1
for all
t.
At the initial time t = 0, we have q(0; Q, P) = Q and p(0; Q, P) = P. This implies
{q, p}(Q, P) = 1
for
t = 0.
Therefore, it remains to show that
d
dt{q, p} = 0
for all
t.
To this end, consider the canonical equations
qt = {q, H},
pt = {p, H}.
By the product rule of calculus, we obtain
d
dt{q, p} = {qt, p} + {q, pt} = {{q, H}, p} + {q, {p, H}}.
Thus, the Jacobi identity yields d
dt{q, p} = {{q, p}, H} = 0, since {q, p} = 1.

6.11 The Spherical Pendulum
Two-dimensional spheres are the simplest curved surfaces. They serve as
prototypes for the geometry and analysis of manifolds.
Folklore
We want to study the motion of a point of mass m on a sphere S2
R of radius R
under the inﬂuence of the gravitational force. This is called a spherical pendulum
(Fig. 6.16). In a Cartesian (x, y, z)-coordinate system, the position of a point of the
sphere is described by the vector
q = xi + yj + zk
(6.78)
with initial point at the center of the ball. The equation of the sphere reads as
x2 + y2 + z2 = R2.
The point (0, 0, R) (resp. (0, 0, −R)) is called the North Pole (resp. South Pole).
6.11.1 The Gaussian Principle of Critical Constraint
The Newtonian equation of motion for the spherical pendulum reads as
m¨q(t) = −mgk + Fc(q(t), ˙q(t)),
t ∈R.
(6.79)
Here, the vector −gmk describes the gravitational force on the surface of earth.
This force acts in direction of the negative z-axis. The additional constraining
force Fc keeps the particle on the sphere. In order to compute the constraining
force, let us use the most general principle in classical mechanics, namely, the
Gaussian principle of critical constraint (see Sect. 7.28 of Vol. I). We have to solve
the following extremal principle:
(m¨q −F)2 = critical!
(6.80)
with the gravitational force F = −gmk and the constraint q2 = R2. As we have
shown on page 492 of Vol. I, this leads to the constraining force
Fc(q, ˙q) = λ(q, ˙q) · q
which is a normal force depending on position and velocity. Explicitly,
λ(q, ˙q) := mg · qk −˙q2
R2
.
Using this, the equation of motion (6.79) looks rather complicated. It is our goal
to simplify the approach.

412
6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
In order to eliminate the constraining force Fc, we will use the principle
of critical action in terms of spherical coordinates.
The gravitational force on the surface of earth has the potential U(z) := mgz. In
fact, the gravitational force −mgk is equal to −U ′(z)k. Therefore, the Lagrangian,
L : = kinetic energy minus potential energy, reads as
L(q, ˙q) := 1
2m ˙q2 −mgz.
(6.81)
This Lagrangian is basic for the following approach.
6.11.2 The Lagrangian Approach
In mechanics it is important to use the appropriate coordinates.

Spherical coordinates. Let ϕ be the geographic length of the sphere, and let
ϑ be the geographic latitude with −π ≤ϕ ≤π and −π
2 ≤ϑ ≤
π
2 . The equator
is described by the equation ϑ = 0 (see Fig. 5.16 on page 305). For the relation
between Cartesian coordinates x, y, z and spherical coordinates, we get
x = R cos ϕ cos ϑ,
y = R sin ϕ cos ϑ,
z = R sin ϑ.
(6.82)
The coordinate line ϑ = const is a parallel line of latitude; it has the tangent vector
b1(P) := ∂q
∂ϕ(P) = R(−sin ϕ cos ϑ i + cos ϕ cos ϑ j)
at the point P = (ϕ, ϑ), by (6.78). Similarly, the meridian ϕ = const has the tangent
vector
b2(P) := ∂q
∂ϑ(P) = R(−cos ϕ sin ϑ i −sin ϕ sin ϑ j + cos ϑ k)
at the point P. The two vectors b1, b2 form an orthogonal basis of the tangent
plane TP S2
R of the sphere at the point P.27 The exterior unit normal vector N of
the sphere at the point P is given by
N := e1 × e2,
where ej := bj(P)
|bj(P)|,
j = 1, 2.
The three vectors e1, e2, N form a right-handed orthonormal system at the point
P of the sphere S2
R.
Velocity vector (tangent vector). The motion of a point on the sphere is
described by the position vector
q(t) = x(t)i + y(t)j + z(t)k,
t ∈R.
Diﬀerentiating the functions
x(t) = R cos ϕ(t) sin ϑ(t),
y(t) = R sin ϕ(t) cos ϑ(t),
z(t) = R sin ϑ(t)
with respect to time t, we obtain
27 The point P has to be diﬀerent from the North Pole and the South Pole, since
the spherical coordinates are singular at the two poles. This can be cured by
introducing new local coordinates near the two poles (e.g., the coordinates (x, y)).
To simplify the approach, we restrict ourselves to spherical coordinates.

˙x(t) = −R ˙ϕ(t) sin ϕ(t) cos ϑ(t) −R ˙ϑ(t) cos ϕ(t) sin ϑ(t).
Furthermore, ˙z(t) = R ˙ϑ(t) cos ϑ(t), and
˙y(t) = R ˙ϕ(t) cos ϕ(t) cos ϑ(t) −R ˙ϑ(t) sin ϕ(t) sin ϑ(t).
Since cos2 α + sin2 α = 1, we get
| ˙q(t)|2 = ˙x(t)2 + ˙y(t)2 + ˙z(t)2 = R2( ˙ϕ(t)2 cos2 ϑ(t) + ˙ϑ(t)2).
The transformed Lagrangian. In terms of spherical coordinates, the La-
grangian reads as
L(ϕ, ϑ, ˙ϕ, ˙ϑ) = 1
2mR2( ˙ϕ2 cos2 ϑ + ˙ϑ2) −mgR sin ϑ.
The principle of critical action postulates that

with (ϕ(t0), ϑ(t0)) = (ϕ0, ϑ0) and (ϕ(t1), ϑ(t1)) = (ϕ1, ϑ1) (boundary condition).
The Euler–Lagrange equation. Each smooth solution of (6.83) satisﬁes

R. Setting ϑ = −π
2 + α, the second equation passes over to
¨α + ω2 sin α = 0.
This is the equation of a circular pendulum. The ﬁrst equation of (6.84) can be
written as
¨ϕ(t) −2 ˙ϕ(t) ˙ϑ(t) sin ϑ(t) = 0.
(6.85)
Geodesics. If the gravitational force vanishes (i.e., g = 0), then the spherical
pendulum is called free. The trajectories of the free pendulum are called geodesics
of the sphere. A piece of the equator (ϕ(t) = t, ϑ(t) = 0) is always a geodesic. By
deﬁnition, a great circle of the sphere is obtained by the intersection between the
sphere and a plane passing through the center of the sphere. After a rotation, if
necessary, we can assume that the great circle is the equator. Consequently, pieces
of great circles are geodesics.
For the motion q = q(t) of the free pendulum, it follows from equation (6.79)
that the tangential component of the acceleration vector ¨q(t) vanishes. According
to Levi-Civita, we say that the vector ¨q(t) is parallel along the trajectory. As we
will show in Vol. III on gauge theory, the parallel transport of physical quantities
is crucial for modern mathematics and physics. This corresponds to the transport
of physical information.

6.11.3 The Hamiltonian Approach
Introduce the generalized momenta
pϕ := L ˙ϕ = mR2 ˙ϕ cos2 ϑ,
pϑ := L ˙ϑ = mR2 ˙ϑ,
and the Hamiltonian, H := pϕ ˙ϕ + pϑ ˙ϑ −L. That is,
H(ϕ, pϕ, ϑ, pϑ) =
p2
ϕ

2mR2 + mgR sin ϑ.
Then the canonical equations read as
˙pϕ = −Hϕ = 0,
˙ϕ = Hpϕ,
˙pϑ = −Hϑ,
˙ϑ = Hpϑ.
In particular, pϕ (z-component of the angular momentum) and H (energy) are
conserved. Set
z0 := R sin ϑ(0),
pϕ := mR2 ˙ϕ(0) cos2 ϑ(0),
E := mR2

6.11.4 Geodesics of Shortest Length
Arc length. Let q = q(t), t0 ≤t ≤t1, be a curve on the sphere S2
R. By deﬁnition,
the arc length of this curve between the points q0 and q(t) is given by
s(t) :=
Z t
t0
| ˙q(τ)| dτ =
Z t

˙ϕ(τ)2 cos2 ϑ(τ) + ˙ϑ(τ)2 dτ.

Mnemonically, we write
ds2 = R2 cos2 ϑ · dϕ2 + R2dϑ2.
(6.86)
Curves of shortest length. Now we are looking for a smooth curve
q = q(t),
t0 ≤t ≤t1
on the sphere S2
R which connects the two point q0 and q1, and which has minimal
length. This is the optimal route for an aircraft which is ﬂying from the city q0 to
the city q1. We have to solve the variational problem
Z t1

q
˙ϕ(t)2 cos2 ϑ(t) + ˙ϑ(t)2 dt = min!
(6.87)
with the side condition (ϕ(t0), ϑ(t0)) = (ϕ0, ϑ0) and (ϕ(t1), ϑ(t1)) = (ϕ1, ϑ1).
Theorem 6.16 If the arc length s is chosen as parameter, then every solution of
the variational problem (6.87) satisﬁes the following system of equations:
¨ϕ(s) −2 ˙ϕ(s) ˙ϑ(s) sin 2ϑ(s) = 0,
¨ϑ(s) = 0.
(6.88)
Proof. The variational problem (6.87) can be written as
Z t1
t0
L dt = min!
with L :=
√
L where L is the Lagrangian of the spherical pendulum (6.83) with
mass m = 2 and vanishing gravitational force (i.e., g = 0). The Euler–Lagrange
equations

d
dsL ˙ϑ = 0.

6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
By (6.84), we obtain the claim (6.88).
2
Suppose we are given two points q0 and q1 on the sphere S2
R. After a rotation,
if necessary, we always can assume that the two points lie on the equator of the
sphere. Then there are two arcs of the equator which connect the two given points.
The smaller arc is a geodesic of shortest length between q0 and q1. Observe that two
points do not always uniquely determine the connecting geodesic. For example, if the
given points q0 and q1 represent the North Pole and the South Pole, respectively,
then each meridian is a connecting geodesic (see Fig. 5.9 on page 277).
6.12 The Lie Group SU(E3) of Rotations
Invariance under rotations leads to conservation of angular momentum.
Folklore
For the motion q = q(t) of a particle in the 3-dimensional space, the time-dependent
vector p(t) := m ˙q(t) (mass times velocity) is called the momentum of the particle
at time t. The angular momentum at time t is deﬁned by
a(t) := q(t) × p(t).
(6.89)
In this section, we study the motion q = q(t) of a particle given by the Newtonian
equation
m¨q(t) = −U ′(q(t)),
t ∈R
(6.90)
under the assumption that the potential U = U(q) only depends on the distance
|q|. In other words, the potential U is invariant under rotations about the origin.
6.12.1 Conservation of Angular Momentum
Proposition 6.17 The angular momentum is conserved for the motion (6.90).
Proof. The trick is that b × b = 0 holds for all vectors b. Let us use Cartesian
(x, y, z)-coordinates. Set r :=
p
x2 + y2 + z2. Then U(q) = V (r). It follows from
∂
∂xV (r) = V ′(r) ∂r
∂x = V ′(r)x
r
and analogous formulas for y and z that
U ′(q) = V ′(r)q
r .
Let q = q(t) be a solution of (6.90). By the product rule,
d
dta(t) = ˙q(t) × m ˙q(t) + q(t) × m¨q(t) = −q(t) × V ′(r(t))q(t)
r(t) = 0.
2
Next we want to discuss the relation between the symmetry group of rotations
and angular momentum.
The Lie group SU(E3) of rotations. In the 3-dimensional space, all the
rotations about the origin form a Lie group denoted by SU(E3). Each such rotation
q 
→q+ can be represented by the Euler formula

ϕ = π
Fig. 6.17. Rotation
q+ = q cos ϕ + (n × q) sin ϕ + (qn)n(1 −cos ϕ).
(6.91)
This formula describes the counterclockwise rotation of the position vector q at the
origin about the axis unit vector n with the rotation angle ϕ (Fig. 6.17). We write
q+ = Rn,ϕq.
The Lie algebra su(3) of inﬁnitesimal rotations. Linearization of (6.91)
with respect to the angle ϕ yields
q+ = q + (ϕn × q).
(6.92)
We call the transformation Rb given by Rbq := b × q an inﬁnitesimal rotation.
Using the the usual linear combination of maps and the Lie product
[Ra, Rb]−:= RaRb −RbRa,
the following hold:
The set of inﬁnitesimal rotations forms a real 3-dimensional Lie algebra
denoted by su(E3).
To prove this, we have to show that Ra, Rb ∈su(E3) implies
[Ra, Rb]−∈su(E3).
This follows from the general theory of Lie groups. However, in order to display
the geometric meaning behind the Lie algebra property of su(E3), let us use the
following argument based on the well-known geometric properties of the vector
product. In fact, it follows from the cyclic Jacobi identity for the vector product
a × (b × c) + b × (c × a) + c × (a × b) = 0
and from a × b = −b × a that
a × (b × c) −b × (a × c) = (a × b) × c.
Hence
RaRbc −RbRac = Ra×bc.
(6.93)
In addition, we have the exponential formula Rn,ϕ = eϕRn.
Conservation of angular momentum and the Noether theorem. We
want to show that the conservation of angular momentum is a consequence of the
Noether theorem with respect to the rotation group. To this end, suppose that
U(q) = V (|q|). Then the Lagrangian
L(q, ˙q) = 1
2m ˙q2 −U(q)
(6.94)

418
6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
is invariant under rotations, and hence the action
S :=
Z t1
t0
L(q(t), ˙q(t)) dt
is invariant under rotations. Each rotation q+ = Rn,ϕq about the origin can be
represented by the Euler formula (6.91). Hence
δq := ε d
dεRn,εq|ε=0 = ε(n × q).
Applying the Noether theorem (6.49) on page 387 to the three components of the
vector function t 
→q(t), we get
d
dτ (Lδt −(δq −˙qδt)L ˙q) = 0
(6.95)
for each solution t 
→q(t) of (6.90). Here, δt = 0. Therefore, δq · L ˙q is conserved.
Consequently,
δq(t) · p(t) = ε(n × q(t)) p(t) = εn(q(t) × p(t)) = const,
t ∈R
for all parameters ε > 0 and all unit vectors n. Hence q(t) × p(t) = const.
Conservation of angular momentum and Poisson brackets. Now we
want to describe an alternative approach for proving the conservation of angular
momentum. This will be based on the use of Poisson brackets. In fact, this approach
will correspond to Lie’s momentum map to be deﬁned in (6.97) below.
The Lagrangian L from (6.94) yields the momentum p = L ˙q = m ˙q and the
Hamiltonian
H(q, p) := p ˙q −L(q, ˙q) = p2
2m + V (|q|).
This implies the partial derivatives Hp = p/m and Hq = V ′(|q|) q
|q|.
Let a(q, p) := q × p. For ﬁxed vector n, set A(q, p) := a(q, p)n, that is,
A(q, p) := (q × p)n.
This way, the vector-valued function a = a(q, p) is replaced by the real-valued
function A = A(q, p). To simplify notation, we do not indicate that the function A
depends on the vector n. Our goal is to show that, for the Poisson bracket, we have
{A, H} = 0.
(6.96)
Then the function A is conserved. Hence
d
dt(q(t) × p(t)) n = 0
for all
t.
This is true for all vectors n. Consequently, we get
d
dt(q(t) × p(t)) = 0
for all
t.
This tells us that the angular momentum is conserved.
It remains to prove (6.96). Using cyclic permutation, we obtain the well-known
vector identity (a × b)c = (b × c)a. Hence A(q, p) = (p × n)q. Then

6.13 Carath´eodory’s Royal Road to the Calculus of Variations
419
∂A
∂q (q, p)h = d
dσ A(q + σh, p)|σ=0 = (p × n)h.
Analogously, ∂A
∂p (q, p)h = (n × q)h. Finally, note that (a × b)c = 0 iﬀthe three
vectors a, b, c are not linearly independent. Since Hp is parallel to p, and Hq is
parallel to q, we get
{A, H} = AqHp −ApHq = (p × n)Hp −(n × q)Hp = 0.
6.12.2 Lie’s Momentum Map
For all vectors q, p and all vectors n, deﬁne
M(q, p)Rn := (q × p)n.
This is Lie’s momentum map related to the Lie algebra su(E3). More precisely, this
is a map of the form
M : (TE3)d →su(E3)d.
(6.97)
Let us brieﬂy discuss this. If we ﬁx the tuple (q, p), then the map
Rn 
→M(q, p)Rn
(6.98)
assigns to each inﬁnitesimal rotation Rn a real number. This map is a linear func-
tional on the Lie algebra su(E3). Hence the map (6.98) is an element of the dual
space su(E3)d to the Lie algebra su(E3). Consequently, the map
(q, p) 
→M(q, p)
assigns to each point (q, p) of the phase space an element of the dual space su(E3)d.
Finally, the points (q, p) of the phase space form the cotangent bundle (TE3)d of
the Euclidean manifold E3. This yields the map (6.97).

6.13.1 The Fundamental Equation
Field of trajectories. Fix n = 1, 2, . . . Caratheodory’s fundamental equation
reads as
St(q, t) = L(q, v(q, t), t) −v(q, t)L ˙q(q, v(q, t), t),
Sq(q, t) = L ˙q(q, v(q, t), t),
(q, t) ∈Rn+1.
(6.99)
We are given the smooth Lagrangian L : R2n+1 →R, where L depends on the vari-
ables q, ˙q ∈Rn and t ∈R. We set q = (q1, . . . , qn), as well as Lq = (Lq1, . . . , Lqn).
(H) We assume that all the eigenvalues of the matrix L ˙q ˙q(q, ˙q, t) of the
second-order partial derivatives of L (with respect to ˙q1, . . . , ˙qn) are positive
for any ﬁxed argument (q, ˙q, t) ∈R2n+1.

420
6. Principle of Critical Action and the Harmonic Oscillator
This means that the function ˙q 
→L(q, ˙q, t) is strictly convex on Rn for any ﬁxed
(q, t) ∈Rn+1. We are looking for smooth functions v : Rn+1 →R and
S : Rn+1 →R,
which are called velocity ﬁeld and action function, respectively. The smooth solu-
tions q = q(t), t ∈R of the so-called velocity equation
˙q(t) = v(q(t), t),
x ∈R
(6.100)
are called trajectories of (6.99). The set of all the solutions of (6.100) is called a ﬁeld
of trajectories. Note that diﬀerent trajectories of the ﬁeld do not intersect, since
the solution of the initial-value problem for the velocity equation (6.100) is unique.
This generalizes the situation pictured in Fig. 5.8 on page 273.28 In addition, let us
consider the principle of least action:
Z t1
t0
L(t, q(t), ˙q(t)) dt = min!,
q(t0) = q0, q(t1) = q1.
(6.101)
Theorem 6.18 Let v, S be a smooth solution of Carath´eodory’s fundamental equa-
tion (6.99). Fix the points (t0, q0) and (t1, q1) in Rn+1. Then the following hold:
(i) Let q = q∗(t), t0 ≤t ≤t1, be a trajectory of (6.99) which satisﬁes the bound-
ary condition q∗(t0) = q0 and q∗(t1) = q1. Then q∗is a solution of the minimum
problem (6.101).
(ii) The diﬀerence S(q1, t1) −S(t0, q0) is equal to the integral
Z t1
t0
L(q∗(t), ˙q∗(t), t) dt.
The proof proceeds analogously to the proof of Theorem 5.2 on page 272.
Extremals. By deﬁnition, precisely the solutions q = q(t) of the Euler–
Lagrange equation
d
dtL ˙q(q(t), ˙q(t), t) = Lq(q(t), ˙q(t), t)
are called extremals of the Lagrangian L. In particular, the solutions of the mini-
mum problem (6.101) are extremals. Theorem 6.18 shows that
The trajectories of (6.99) are extremals.
This statement remains true if the convexity assumption (H) above is not satisﬁed.
Then, for the proof, one has to use the Carath´eodory equation (6.99) together with
the integrability condition Stq = Sqt. Therefore, the ﬁeld of trajectories related to
(6.100) is also called a ﬁeld of extremals.
Legendre transformation. We deﬁne the co-velocity (or momentum)
p := L ˙q(q, ˙q, t).
Because of assumption (H) above, this equation is locally invertible, by the im-
plicit function theorem. To simplify the formulation, we assume that the Legendre
transformation (q, ˙q, t) 
→(q, p, t) is a diﬀeomorphism from R2n+1 onto R2n+1. This
yields the smooth Hamiltonian H : R2n+1 →R given by
H(q, p, t) := p ˙q(q, p, t) −L(q, ˙q(q, p, t), t)
for all
(q, p, t) ∈R2n+1.
The proof of the following theorem proceeds as on page 274.
28 We assume that the solutions of the velocity equation exist for all times t ∈R.
Otherwise, the following results are only valid locally.

Theorem 6.19 If v, S is a smooth solution of Carth´eodory’s fundamental equation
(6.99), then the action function S is a solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
St(q, t) + H(q, Sq(q, t), t) = 0.
6.13.2 Lagrangian Submanifolds in Symplectic Geometry
In geometrical optics, one wants to construct wave fronts by means of families of
light rays. The point is that only special families of light rays allow this construction.
This is intimately related to the notion of Lagrange brackets, which were introduced
by Lagrange in the 18th century in order to simplify computations in celestial me-
chanics in the framework of perturbation theory.29 The point is that the Lagrange
brackets of a family of light rays are constant in time along the light rays (i.e.,
they are ﬁrst integrals of the Hamilton canonical equations). In modern symplectic
geometry, the Lagrange brackets are reformulated as Lagrangian submanifolds of
a symplectic manifold. Replacing light rays by trajectories of particles in classical
mechanics, we will study
• the construction of a solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi partial diﬀerential equation
• by the help of suitable families of trajectories which satisfy the Hamilton canon-
ical system of ordinary diﬀerential equations.
The following general approach contains geometrical optics in the 3-dimensional
(x, y, z)-space as a special case. To this end, we consider the light rays
y = y(x),
z = z(x),
and we choose x := t, y := q1, z := q2, y′ := ˙q1, z′ := ˙q2, as well as
L(x, y, z, y′, z′) := n(x, y, z)

The Lagrange brackets. Consider the smooth map
q = q(u), p = p(u),
u ∈U

from the nonempty open subset U of Rn into R2n. The target space R2n is a
symplectic manifold equipped with the symplectic 2-form

Here, we introduce the so-called Lagrange brackets
29 We have shown in Sect. 17.17.4 of Vol. I that the fundamental Dyson series in
quantum electrodynamics is closely related to the method of the variation of
the parameter. Lagrange invented this method in order to compute the secular
perturbations of the orbits of planets.

Lagrangian submanifolds. Let (6.102) be an immersion. Then the image set

The general deﬁnition in symplectic geometry reads as follows:
• Fix the number n = 1, 2, . . . Let M be a 2n-dimensional symplectic manifold
with the symplectic 2-form ω, that is, dω = 0 on M and ω is non-degenerated.30
• An n-dimensional isotropic submanifold L of M is called a Lagrangian subman-
ifold. That is, for any point P on the submanifold L, we have
ωP (v, w) = 0
for all
v, w ∈TP L.
The main theorem on Lagrangian manifolds in the calculus of vari-
ations. We want to construct a local solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi partial dif-
ferential equation by using a suitable n-parameter family of trajectories of the
Hamilton canonical system of ordinary diﬀerential equations. To this end, ﬁx the
point (u0, t0) ∈Rn+1. Consider the smooth functions
q = q(t, u), p = p(t, u),
u ∈J, u ∈U,
(6.103)
where J is an open interval, and U is an arcwise connected open subset of Rn+1
with (t0, u0) ∈J × U. Suppose that the following assumptions are met:
(H1) For any ﬁxed parameter u ∈U, the trajectories from (6.103) are solutions of
the Hamilton canonical equations ˙p = −Hq, ˙q = Hp on the time interval J.
(H2) det qu(u, t) ̸= 0 for all (u, t) ∈U × J.
(H3) [uj, uk](t0, u) = 0 for all u ∈U and all j, k = 1, . . . , n.
By hypothesis (H1), for any time t ∈J, the map (6.103) is an immersion, and hence
its image is a submanifold of the (q, p)-phase space R2n. Moreover, by the crucial
hypothesis (H3), the image of the map (6.103) at the initial time t0 is a Lagrangian
submanifold of the phase space R2n. By (H2), the implicit function theorem tells
us that the equation q = q(t, u) is uniquely solvable in a suﬃciently small open
neighborhood of the point (t0, u0). This yields the smooth function u = u(t, q) in a
suﬃciently small open neighborhood of the point (t0, q0) with q0 := q(t0, u0). Now
to the point. For any ﬁxed parameter u ∈U, compute the curve integral
S∗(t1, u1) :=
Z (t1,u1)
(t0,u0)
(p ˙q −H(q, p, t))dt + qqu du.
(6.104)
Here, we replace the symbols q and p by (6.103), and we choose a ﬁxed smooth
curve t = t(τ), u = u(τ), τ0 ≤τ ≤τ1, which connects the points (t0, u0) and (t1, u1)
in the set J × U. Explicitly,
qqu du =
n
X
k=1
qpukduk.
The proof of the following theorem will show that the integral (6.104) does not
depend on the choice of the path.
30 Explicitly, for any point P ∈M, it follows from ωP (v0, v) = 0 for all tangent
vectors v ∈TP M and ﬁxed v0 ∈TP M that v0 = 0. Here, TP M denotes the
tangent space of the manifold M at the point P.

The integral (6.104) is called the Poincar´e–Cartan integral invariant.
Finally, let us introduce the desired function S by setting
S(q, t) := S∗(t, u(t, q)).
Theorem 6.20 For any ﬁxed time t ∈J, the image of the map (6.103) is a La-
grangian submanifold of the phase space R2n.
The function S = S(q, t) is a smooth solution of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation
St(q, t) + H(q, Sq(q, t), t) = 0 on a suﬃciently small open neighborhood of the point
(q0, t0).
The proof of this theorem can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV, p. 85 (see
the references on page 1049). The basic idea is to show that the Lagrange brackets
of (6.103) are constant in time. Thus, by (H3), the Lagrange brackets vanish iden-
tically on J ×U. This implies that the integral (6.104) is path-independent. Finally,
diﬀerentiating (6.104) with respect to both the time t1 and the parameter u1, we
get the Hamilton–Jacobi diﬀerential equation for the function S.
6.13.3 The Initial-Value Problem for the Hamilton–Jacobi
Equation
Fix the point (q0, t0) in Rn+1, n = 1, 2, . . . We are given the smooth real-valued
function S0 on an open neighborhood of the point (q0, t0) in Rn+1.
Theorem 6.21 The initial-value problem for the Hamilton–Jacobi partial diﬀer-
ential equation,
St(q, t) + H(q, Sq(q, t), t) = 0,
S(q, t0) = S0(q),
has a unique smooth local solution at the point (q0, t0).
The full proof can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV, p. 88 (see the references
on page 1049). The basic idea reads as follows. Fix the parameter u ∈Rn. Consider
the Hamilton canonical system
˙q(t) = Hp(q(t), p(t), t),
˙p(t) = −Hq(q(t), p(t), t)
with the initial condition q(t0, u) = S0(u), p(t0, u) = 0. This yields the family
q = q(t, u), p = p(t, u). Trivially, all the Lagrange brackets [uj, uk](t0, u) vanish at
the initial time t0. By Theorem 6.20, we obtain the desired solution. Uniqueness
follows by reduction to the unique solvability of the initial-value problem for the
Hamilton canonical ordinary diﬀerential equations.
6.13.4 Solution of Carath´eodory’s Fundamental Equation
Consider the solution S = S(q, t) of the Hamilton–Jacobi equation from Theorem
6.21.
Theorem 6.22 There exists a smooth velocity ﬁeld v = v(q, t) such that S, v is
a smooth local solution of Carath´eodory’s fundamental equation (6.99) at the point
(q0, t0).
Proof. Set p(q, t) := Sq(q, t). Local inversion of the Legendre transformation
p(q, t) = L ˙q(q, v(q, t), t) yields the desired function v = v(q, t) (compare the proof
given in Sect. 5.5.1 on page 275).

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator –
Ariadne’s Thread in Quantization
Whoever understands the quantization of the harmonic oscillator can un-
derstand everything in quantum physics.
Folklore
Almost all of physics now relies upon quantum physics. This theory was
discovered around the beginning of this century. Since then, it has known
a progress with no analogue in the history of science, ﬁnally reaching a
status of universal applicability.
The radical novelty of quantum mechanics almost immediately brought a
conﬂict with the previously admitted corpus of classical physics, and this
went as far as rejecting the age-old representation of physical reality by
visual intuition and common sense. The abstract formalism of the theory
had almost no direct counterpart in the ordinary features around us, as,
for instance, nobody will ever see a wave function when looking at a car
or a chair. An ever-present randomness also came to contradict classical
determinism.1
Roland Omn`es, 1994
Quantum mechanics deserves the interest of mathematicians not only be-
cause it is a very important physical theory, which governs all microphysics,
that is, the physical phenomena at the microscopic scale of 10−10m, but
also because it turned out to be at the root of important developments of
modern mathematics.2
Franco Strocchi, 2005
In this chapter, we will study the following quantization methods:
• Heisenberg quantization (matrix mechanics; creation and annihilation operators),
• Schr¨odinger quantization (wave mechanics; the Schr¨odinger partial diﬀerential
equation),
• Feynman quantization (integral representation of the wave function by means of
the propagator kernel, the formal Feynman path integral, the rigorous inﬁnite-
dimensional Gaussian integral, and the rigorous Wiener path integral),
• Weyl quantization (deformation of Poisson structures),

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• Weyl quantization functor from symplectic linear spaces to C∗-algebras,
• Bargmann quantization (holomorphic quantization),
• supersymmetric quantization (fermions and bosons).
We will choose the presentation of the material in such a way that the
reader is well prepared for the generalizations to quantum ﬁeld theory to
be considered later on.
Formally self-adjoint operators. The operator A : D(A) →X on the complex
Hilbert space X is called formally self-adjoint iﬀthe operator is linear, the domain
of deﬁnition D(A) is a linear dense subspace of the Hilbert space X, and we have
the symmetry condition
⟨χ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨Aχ|ϕ⟩
for all
χ, ψ ∈D(A).
Formally self-adjoint operators are also called symmetric operators. The following
two observations are crucial for quantum mechanics:
• If the complex number λ is an eigenvalue of A, that is, there exists a nonzero
element ϕ ∈D(A) such that Aϕ = λϕ, then λ is a real number. This follows
from λ = ⟨ϕ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨Aϕ|ϕ⟩= λ†.
• If λ1 and λ2 are two diﬀerent eigenvalues of the operator A with eigenvectors ϕ1
and ϕ2, then ϕ1 is orthogonal to ϕ2. This follows from
(λ1 −λ2)⟨ϕ1|ϕ2⟩= ⟨Aϕ1|ϕ2⟩−⟨ϕ1|Aϕ2⟩= 0.
In quantum mechanics, formally self-adjoint operators represent formal observables.
For a deeper mathematical analysis, we need self-adjoint operators, which
are called observables in quantum mechanics.
Each self-adjoint operator is formally self-adjoint. But, the converse is not true. For
the convenience of the reader, on page 683 we summarize basic material from func-
tional analysis which will be frequently encountered in this chapter. This concerns
the following notions: formally adjoint operator, adjoint operator, self-adjoint oper-
ator, essentially self-adjoint operator, closed operator, and the closure of a formally
self-adjoint operator. The reader, who is not familiar with this material, should
have a look at page 683. Observe that, as a rule, in the physics literature one does
not distinguish between formally self-adjoint operators and self-adjoint operators.
Peter Lax writes:3
The theory of self-adjoint operators was created by John von Neumann to
fashion a framework for quantum mechanics. The operators in Schr¨odin-
ger’s theory from 1926 that are associated with atoms and molecules
are partial diﬀerential operators whose coeﬃcients are singular at certain
points; these singularities correspond to the unbounded growth of the force
between two electrons that approach each other. . . I recall in the summer
of 1951 the excitement and elation of von Neumann when he learned that
Kato (born 1917) has proved the self-adjointness of the Schr¨odinger oper-
ator associated with the helium atom.4

And what do the physicists think of these matters? In the 1960s Friedrichs5
met Heisenberg and used the occasion to express to him the deep gratitude
of the community of mathematicians for having created quantum mechan-
ics, which gave birth to the beautiful theory of operators in Hilbert space.
Heisenberg allowed that this was so; Friedrichs then added that the math-
ematicians have, in some measure, returned the favor. Heisenberg looked
noncommittal, so Friedrichs pointed out that it was a mathematician, von
Neumann, who clariﬁed the diﬀerence between a self-adjoint operator and
one that is merely symmetric.“What’s the diﬀerence,” said Heisenberg.
As a rule of thumb, a formally self-adjoint (also called symmetric) diﬀerential op-
erator can be extended to a self-adjoint operator if we add appropriate boundary
conditions. The situation is not dramatic for physicists, since physics dictates the
‘right’ boundary conditions in regular situations. However, one has to be careful.
In Problem 7.19, we will consider a formally self-adjoint diﬀerential operator which
cannot be extended to a self-adjoint operator.
The point is that self-adjoint operators possess a spectral family which al-
lows us to construct both the probability measure for physical observables
and the functions of observables (e.g., the propagator for the quantum dy-
namics).
In general terms, this is not possible for merely formally self-adjoint operators.
The following proposition displays the diﬀerence between formally self-adjoint and
self-adjoint operators.
Proposition 7.1 The linear, densely deﬁned operator A : D(A) →X on the com-
plex Hilbert space X is self-adjoint iﬀit is formally self-adjoint and it always follows
from
⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨χ|ϕ⟩
for ﬁxed ψ, χ ∈X and all ϕ ∈D(A) that ψ ∈D(A).
Therefore, the domain of deﬁnition D(A) of the operator A plays a critical role.
The proof will be given in Problem 7.7.
Unitary operators. As we will see later on, for the quantum dynamics, unitary
operators play the decisive role. Recall that the operator U : X →X is called
unitary iﬀit is linear, bijective, and it preserves the inner product, that is,
⟨Uχ|Uϕ⟩= ⟨χ|ϕ⟩
for all
χ, ϕ ∈X.
This implies ||Uϕ|| = ||ϕ|| for all ϕ ∈X. Hence
||U|| :=
sup
||ϕ||≤1
||Uϕ|| = 1
if we exclude the trivial case X = {0}.

self-adjoint operators on the inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space X. Let ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . .
be a complete orthonormal system in X with ϕk ∈D(A) for all k. Set
ajk := ⟨ϕj|Aϕk⟩
j, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
The way, we assign to the operator A the inﬁnite matrix (ajk). Similarly, for the
operator B, we deﬁne
bjk := ⟨ϕj|Bϕk⟩
j, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Suppose that the operator B is a proper extension of the operator A. Then
ajk = bjk
for all
j, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,
but A ̸= B. Thus, the matrix (ajk) does not completely reﬂect the properties of
the operator A. In particular, the matrix (ajk) does not see the crucial domain of
deﬁnition D(A) of the operator A. Jean Dieudonn´e writes:6
Von Neumann took pains, in a special paper, to investigate how Hermitean
(i.e., formally self-adjoint) operators might be represented by inﬁnite ma-
trices (to which many mathematicians and even more physicists were sen-
timentally attached) . . . Von Neumann showed in great detail how the lack
of “one-to-oneness” in the correspondence of matrices and operators led to
their weirdest pathology, convincing once for all the analysts that matrices
were a totally inadequate tool in spectral theory.
7.1 Complete Orthonormal Systems
A complete orthonormal system of eigenstates of an observable (e.g., the
energy operator) cannot be extended to a larger orthonormal system of
eigenstates.
Folklore
Basic question. Let H : D(H) →X be a formally self-adjoint operator on the
inﬁnite-dimensional separable complex Hilbert space X. Physicists have invented
algebraic methods for computing eigensolutions of the form
Hϕn = Enϕn,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(7.1)
The idea is to apply so-called ladder operators which are based on the use of com-
mutation relations (related to Lie algebras or super Lie algebras). We will encounter
this method several times. In terms of physics, the operator H describes the energy
of the quantum system under consideration. Here, the real numbers E0, E1, E2, . . .
are the energy values, and ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . are the corresponding energy eigenstates.
Suppose that ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . is an orthonormal system, that is,
⟨ϕk|ϕn⟩= δkn,
k, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
There arises the following crucial question.

7.1 Complete Orthonormal Systems
431
Is the system of the computed energy eigenvalues E0, E1, E2 . . . complete?
The following theorem gives us the answer in terms of analysis.
Theorem 7.2 If the orthonormal system ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . is complete in the Hilbert space
X, then there are no other energy eigenvalues than E0, E1, E2, . . ., and the system
ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . cannot be extended to a larger orthonormal system of eigenstates.
Before giving the proof, we need some analytical tools.
Completeness. By deﬁnition, the orthonormal system ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2 . . . is com-
plete iﬀ, for any ϕ ∈X, the Fourier series
ϕ =

⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩ϕn
is convergent in X, that is, limN→∞||ϕ −PN
n=0⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩ϕn|| = 0. The proof of the
following proposition can be found in Zeidler (1995a), Chap. 3 (see the references
on page 1049).
Proposition 7.3 Let ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2 . . . be an orthonormal system in the inﬁnite-di-
mensional separable complex Hilbert space X. Then the following statements are
equivalent.
(i) The system ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . is complete.
(ii) For all ϕ, ψ ∈X, we have the convergent series
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=

which is called the Parseval equation.
(iii) I = P∞
n=0 ϕn ⊗ϕn (completeness relation).7
(iv) For all ϕ ∈X, we have the convergent series ||ϕ||2 = P∞
n=0 |⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩|2.
(v) Let ϕ ∈X. If all the Fourier coeﬃcients of ϕ vanish, that is, we have
⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩= 0 for all n, then ϕ = 0.
(vi) The linear hull of the set {ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . .} is dense in the Hilbert space X.
Explicitly, for any ϕ ∈X and any number ε > 0, there exist complex numbers
a0, . . . , an such that ||ϕ −(a1ϕ1 + . . . + anϕn)|| < ε.
Proof of Theorem 7.2. Suppose that Hϕ = Eϕ with ϕ ̸= 0 and that the eigen-
value E is diﬀerent from E0, E1, E2, . . . . Since the eigenvectors for diﬀerent eigen-
values are orthogonal to each other, we get ⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩= 0 for all indices n. By Prop.
7.3(v), ϕ = 0. This is a contradiction.

The Dirac calculus. According to Dirac, we write equation (7.1) as

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Mnemonically, from (7.3) we obtain |ϕ⟩= P∞

This coincides with the Fourier series expansion ϕ = P∞

seval equation (7.2).
The following investigations serve as a preparation for the quantization of the
harmonic oscillator in the sections to follow.

The Hilbert space L2(R). We consider the space L2(R) of complex-valued (mea-
surable) functions ψ : R →C with
R ∞
−∞|ψ(x)|2dx < ∞. This becomes a complex
Hilbert space equipped with the inner product
⟨ϕ|ψ⟩:=

ϕ, ψ ∈L2(R).
Moreover, ||ψ|| :=

⟨ψ|ψ⟩. The precise deﬁnition of L2(R) can be found in Vol. I,
Sect. 10.2.4. Recall that the Hilbert space L2(R) is inﬁnite-dimensional and sepa-
rable. For example, the complex-valued function ψ on the real line is contained in
L2(R) if we have the growth restriction at inﬁnity,
|ψ(x)| ≤const
1 + |x|
for all
x ∈R,
and ψ is either continuous or discontinuous in a reasonable way (e.g., ψ is continuous
up to a ﬁnite or a countable subset of the real line). Furthermore, we will use the
space S(R) of smooth functions ψ : R →C which rapidly decrease at inﬁnity (e.g.,
ψ(x) := e−x2). The space S(R) is a linear subspace of the Hilbert space L2(R).
Moreover, S(R) is dense in L2(R). The precise deﬁnition of S(R) can be found in
Vol. I, Sect. 2.7.4.

The operators a and a† have the following properties:
(i) The operator a† : S(R) →S(R) is the formally adjoint operator to the operator
a : S(R) →S(R) on the Hilbert space L2(R).9 This means that
⟨ϕ|aψ⟩= ⟨a†ϕ|ψ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈S(R).
(ii) We have the commutation relation
[a, a†]−= I
where I denotes the identity operator on the Hilbert space L2(R). Recall that
[A, B]−:= AB −BA.
(iii) Set ϕ0(x) := c0e−x2/2x2
0 with the normalization constant c0 :=

√π . Then
aϕ0 = 0.
(iv) The operator N : S(R) →S(R) given by N := a†a is formally self-adjoint, and
it has the eigensolutions
Nϕn = nϕn,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
where we set
ϕn := (a†)n
√
n!
ϕ0.
(7.6)
(v) For n = 0, 1, 2, . . ., we have
a†ϕn =
√
n + 1 ϕn+1,
aϕn+1 =
√
n + 1 ϕn.
Because of these relations, the operators a and a† are called ladder operators.10
(vi) The functions ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . form a complete orthonormal system of the complex
Hilbert space L2(R). This means that
⟨ϕn|ϕm⟩=
Z ∞
−∞
ϕn(x)†ϕm(x) dx = δnm,
n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . .
8 In applications to the harmonic oscillator later on, the quantity x has the phys-
ical dimension of length. We introduce the typical length scale x0 in order to
guarantee that the operators a and a† are dimensionless.
9 In functional analysis, one has to distinguish between the formally adjoint oper-
ator a† : S(R) →S(R) and the adjoint operator a∗: D(a∗) →L2(R) which is an
extension of a†, that is, S(R) ⊆D(a∗) ⊆L2(R) and a∗ϕ = a†ϕ for all ϕ ∈S(R)
(see Problem 7.4).
10 Ladder operators are frequently used in the theory of Lie algebras and in quantum
physics in order to compute eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Many examples can be
found in H. Green, Matrix Mechanics, Noordhoﬀ, Groningen, 1965, and in Shi-
Hai Dong, Factorization Method in Quantum Mechanics, Springer, Dordrecht,
2007 (including supersymmetry). We will encounter this several times later on.

are deﬁned by

Similarly, we introduce the matrix elements (a†)mn of the operator a† by setting
(a†)mn := ⟨ϕm|a†ϕn⟩,
m, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Then (a†)mn = a†
nm. Thus, the matrix to the operator a† is the adjoint matrix
to the matrix (amn).
Let us prove these statements. To simplify notation, we set x0 := 1.

Hence (aa† −a†a)ψ = ψ.

⟨ϕ|a†aψ⟩= ⟨aϕ|aψ⟩= ⟨a†aϕ|ψ⟩.
Hence ⟨ϕ|Nψ⟩= ⟨Nϕ|ψ⟩. Thus, the operator N is formally self-adjoint. We now
proceed by induction. Obviously, Nϕ0 = a†(aϕ0) = 0. Suppose that Nϕn = nϕn.
Then, by (ii),
N(a†ϕn) = a†aa†ϕn = a†(a†a + I)ϕn.
This implies

7.2 Bosonic Creation and Annihilation Operators

N(a†ϕn) = a†(N + I)ϕn = (n + 1)a†ϕn.
Thus, Nϕn+1 = (n + 1)ϕn+1.

Moreover, by (ii) and (iv),

n + 1 aϕn+1 = aa†ϕn = (a†a + I)ϕn = (n + 1)ϕn.
Ad (vi). We ﬁrst show that the functions ϕ0, ϕ1, ... form an orthonormal system.
In fact, by the Gaussian integral,
⟨ϕ0|ϕ0⟩=
Z ∞

e−x2
√π dx = 1.
We now proceed by induction. Suppose that ⟨ϕn|ϕn⟩= 1. Then
(n + 1)⟨ϕn+1|ϕn+1⟩= ⟨a†ϕn|a†ϕn⟩= ⟨ϕn|aa†ϕn⟩= ⟨ϕn|(N + I)ϕn⟩.
By (iv), this is equal to (n + 1)⟨ϕn|ϕn⟩. Hence ⟨ϕn+1|ϕn+1⟩= 1.
Since the operator N is formally self-adjoint, eigenvectors of N to diﬀerent
eigenvalues are orthogonal to each other. Explicitly, it follows from
n⟨ϕn|ϕm⟩= ⟨Nϕn|ϕm⟩= ⟨ϕn|Nϕm⟩= m⟨ϕn|ϕm⟩
that ⟨ϕn|ϕm⟩= 0 if n ̸= m. Finally, we will show below that the functions ϕ0, ϕ1, ...
coincide with the Hermite functions which form a complete orthonormal system in
L2(R).
Ad (vii). By (v),
⟨ϕm|aϕn⟩= √n⟨ϕm|ϕn−1⟩= √n δm,n−1.
Moreover, (a†)mn = ⟨ϕm|a†ϕn⟩= ⟨aϕm|ϕn⟩= (anm)†.

Physical interpretation. In quantum ﬁeld theory, the results above allow the
following physical interpretation.
• The function ϕn represents a normalized n-particle state.
• Since Nϕn = nϕn and the state ϕn consists of n particles, the operator N is
called the particle number operator.
• Since Nϕ0 = 0, the state ϕ0 is called the (normalized) vacuum state; there are
no particles in the state ϕ0.
• By (v) above, the operator a† sends the n-particle state ϕn to the (n+1)-particle
state ϕn+1. Naturally enough, the operator a† is called the particle creation
operator. In particular, the n-particle state
ϕn = (a†)n
√
n!
ϕ0
is obtained from the vacuum state ϕ0 by an n-fold application of the particle
creation operator a.11
11 For the vacuum state ϕ0, physicists also use the notation |0⟩.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• Similarly, by (v) above, the operator a sends the (n+1)-particle state ϕn+1 to the
n-particle state ϕn. Therefore, the operator a is called the particle annihilation
operator.
The position operator Q and the momentum operator P. We set

(a† −a).
This way, we obtain the two linear operators Q, P : S(R) →S(R) along with the
commutation relation
[Q, P]−= iℏI.
This follows from [a, a†]−= I. In fact,
[Q, P]−= 1
2[a† + a, iℏ(a† −a)]−.
Hence 2[Q, P]−= iℏ[a, a†]−−iℏ[a†, a]−= 2iℏ[a, a†]−= 2iℏI. Explicitly, for all
functions ψ ∈S(R) and all x ∈R,
(Qψ)(x) = xψ(x),
(Pψ)(x) = −iℏdψ(x)
dx
.
Hence P = −iℏd
dx. The operators Q, P are formally self-adjoint, that is,
⟨ϕ|Qψ⟩= ⟨Qϕ|ψ⟩,
⟨ϕ|Pψ⟩= ⟨Pϕ|ψ⟩
for all functions ϕ, ψ ∈S(R). In fact,
⟨ϕ|Qψ⟩=

The Hermite functions. To simplify notation, we set x0 := 1. We will show
that the functions ϕ0, ϕ1, ... introduced above coincide with the classical Hermite
functions.12 To this end, for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., we introduce the Hermite polynomials

2n (a + a†) · · · (a + a†).
This is a polynomial with respect to a and a†. By deﬁnition, the normal product

We get the key relation
⟨ϕ0| : Qn : ϕ0⟩= 0,
n = 1, 2, . . . ,
telling us that the vacuum expectation value of the normal product is equal to
zero. This follows from aϕ0 = 0, which implies ⟨ϕ0| . . . aϕ0⟩= 0 together with
⟨ϕ0|a† . . .⟩= ⟨aϕ0| . . .⟩= 0. Finally, we set : Q0 := I if n = 0.
For example, Q2 = 1
2(a+a†)(a+a†) is equal to 1
2(a2 +aa† +a†a+(a†)2). Hence
: Q2 := 1
2a2 + a†a + 1

This implies : Q2 : ψ = (x2 −1

This tells us that the so-called coherent state ϕα is an eigenstate of the annihi-
lation operator a. There exists a continuous family {ϕα}α∈C of eigenstates of the
operator a. In terms of physics, the coherent state ϕα is the superposition of states
ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . with the ﬁxed particle number 0, 1, 2, . . ., respectively, and it is stable
under particle annihilation, by (7.10).
Coherent states are frequently used as a nice tool for studying special physical
situations in quantum optics, quantum statistics, and quantum ﬁeld theory (e.g.,
the mathematical modelling of laser beams).

7.3 Heisenberg’s Quantum Mechanics
Quantum mechanics was born on December 14, 1900, when Max Planck
delivered his famous lecture before the German Physical Society in Berlin
which was printed afterwards under the title “On the law of energy distri-
bution in the normal spectrum.” In this paper, Planck assumed that the
emission and absorption of radiation always takes place in discrete portions
of energy or energy quanta hν, where ν is the frequency of the emitted or
absorbed radiation. Starting with this assumption, Planck arrived at his
famous formula
ϱ =
αν3
ehν/kT −1
for the energy density ϱ of black-body radiation at temperature T.14

7.3 Heisenberg’s Quantum Mechanics
441
The present paper seeks to establish a basis for theoretical quantum me-
chanics founded exclusively upon relationships between quantities which
in principle are observable.15
Werner Heisenberg, 1925
The recently published theoretical approach of Heisenberg is here devel-
oped into a systematic theory of quantum mechanics with the aid of math-
ematical matrix theory. After a brief survey of the latter, the mechanical
equations of motions are derived from a variational principle and it is
shown that using Heisenberg’s quantum condition, the principle of energy
conservation and Bohr’s frequency condition follow from the mechanical
equations. Using the anharmonic oscillator as example, the question of
uniqueness of the solution and of the signiﬁcance of the phases of the
partial vibrations is raised. The paper concludes with an attempt to in-
corporate electromagnetic ﬁeld laws into the new theory.16
Max Born and Pascal Jordan, 1925
There exist three diﬀerent, but equivalent approaches to quantum mechanics,
namely,
(i) Heisenberg’s particle quantization from the year 1925 and its reﬁnement by
Born, Dirac, and Jordan in 1926,
(ii) Schr¨odinger’s wave quantization from 1926, and
(iii) Feynman’s statistics over classical paths via path integral from 1942.
In what follows we will thoroughly discuss these three approaches in terms of the
harmonic oscillator. Let us start with (i).
The classical harmonic oscillator. Recall that the diﬀerential equation
¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = 0,
t ∈R
(7.14)
describes the motion q = q(t) of a point of mass m on the real line which oscillates
with the positive angular frequency ω. We add the initial condition q(0) = q0 and
˙q(0) = v0. Let us introduce the momentum p := m ˙q and the Hamiltonian
H(q, p) := p2
2m + mω2q2
2
which represents the energy of the particle. Recall that the equation of motion
(7.14) is equivalent to the canonical equations ˙p = −Hq, ˙q = Hq. Explicitly,
˙p(t) = −mω2q(t),
m ˙q(t) = p(t),
t ∈R,
along with the initial conditions q(0) = q0 and p(0) = p0. Note that p0 = mv0
where v0 is the initial velocity of the particle. Let us introduce the typical length
scale
x0 :=
r
ℏ
mω
which can be formed by using the parameters m, ω and ℏ. Let a be an arbitrary
complex number. The general solution of (7.14) is given by
15 W. Heisenberg, Quantum-theoretical re-interpretation of kinematic and mechan-
ical relations, Z. Physik 33 (1925), 879–893 (in German).

For the momentum, we get

Letting t = 0, we obtain

p(0). Hence, for the conjugate complex Fourier coeﬃcient,
a† =

√

„q(0)
x0 −ix0p(0)

«
.
For the Hamiltonian,
H(q(t), p(t)) = ℏω(a†a + 1
2),
t ∈R.
This expression does not depend on time t which reﬂects conservation of energy for
the motion of the harmonic oscillator. Note that
q(t)† = q(t),
p(t)† = p(t)
for all
t ∈R,
and that a, a† are dimensionless. In quantum mechanics, this classical reality con-
dition will be replaced by the formal self-adjointness of the operators q(t) and p(t).
The classical uncertainty relation. The motion q = q(t) has the time period
T = 2π/ω. Let us now study the time means of the classical motion. For a T-periodic
function f : R →R, we deﬁne the mean value
¯f = 1

and the mean ﬂuctuation Δf by
(Δf)2 = (f −¯f)2 = 1
T
Z T/2
−T/2
(f(t) −¯f)2dt.
To simplify computations, let us restrict ourselves to the special case where the
initial velocity of the particle vanishes, p0 = 0. Then we get the energy E =
mω2q(0)2/2, along with17
¯q = ¯p = 0,
Δp = mωΔq,
Δq =

This implies the so-called classical uncertainty relation:

Poisson brackets. In order to quantize the classical harmonic oscillator, it is
convenient to write the classical equation of motion in terms of Poisson brackets.
Recall that
{A(q, p), B(q, p)} := ∂A(q, p)
∂q
∂B(q, p)
∂p
−∂B(q, p)
∂q
∂A(q, p)
∂p
.
For example, {q, p} := 1, {q, H} = Hp = p/m, and {p, H} = −Hq = −mω2q. Thus,
for all times t ∈R, the equations of motion for the harmonic oscillator read as
˙q(t) = {q(t), H(q(t), p(t))},
˙p(t) = {p(t), H(q(t)), p(t)},
(7.17)
together with {q(t), p(t)} = 1.
7.3.1 Heisenberg’s Equation of Motion
In a recent paper, Heisenberg puts forward a new theory which suggests
that it is not the equations of classical mechanics that are in any way at
fault, but that the mathematical operations by which physical results are
deduced from them require modiﬁcation. All the information supplied by
the classical theory can thus be made use of in the new theory . . . We make
the fundamental assumption that the diﬀerence between the Heisenberg
products is equal to iℏtimes their Poison bracket
xy −yx = iℏ{x, y}.
(7.18)
It seems reasonable to take (7.18) as constituting the general quantum
conditions.18
Paul Dirac, 1925
The general quantization principle. We are looking for a simple principle which
allows us to pass from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics. This principle
reads as follows:
• position q(t) and momentum p(t) of the particle at time t become operators,
• and Poisson brackets are replaced by Lie brackets,
{A(q, p), B(q, p)}
⇒
1
iℏ[A(q, p), B(q, p)]−.
Recall that [A, B]−:= AB −BA. Using this quantization principle, the classical
equation of motion (7.17) passes over to the equation of motion for the quantum
harmonic oscillator
iℏ˙q(t) =
[q(t), H(q(t), p(t))]−,
iℏ˙p(t) =
[p(t), H(q(t), p(t))]−

Poisson structures was proven by Kontsevich. In 1998, he was awarded the Fields
medal for this (see the papers by Kontsevich (2003) and by Cattaneo and Felder
(2000) quoted on page 676).

[q(t), p(t)]−= iℏI.
(7.20)
The latter equation is called the Heisenberg–Born–Jordan commutation relation.
The method of Fourier quantization. In order to solve the equations of
motion (7.19), (7.20), we use the classical solution formula

p(t) = m ˙q(t) =

(7.21)
for all times t ∈R. But we replace the classical Fourier coeﬃcients a and a† by
operators a and a† which satisfy the commutation relation
[a, a†]−= I.
These operators can be found in Sect. 7.2. Let us check that indeed we obtain a
solution. First of all note that
[q(t), p(t)]−= 1
2iℏ[a†eiωt + ae−iωt, a†eiωt −ae−iωt]−
= 1
2iℏ([a, a†]−−[a†, a]−) = iℏ[a, a†]−= iℏI.
As in the classical case, one checks easily that
m ˙q(t) = p(t),
˙p(t) = −mω2q(t).
Moreover, it follows from [q, p]−= iℏthat
[q, p2]−= ([q, p]−)p + p[q, p]−= 2iℏp.
Similarly, for n = 1, 2, ...,
[q, pn]−= iℏnpn−1,
[p, qn]−= −iℏnqn−1,
by induction. Hence
2m[q(t), H(q(t), p(t))]−= [q(t), p(t)2]−= 2iℏp(t) = 2miℏ˙q(t).
This is the ﬁrst equation of motion. Similarly, we get the second equation of motion
[p(t), H(q(t), p(t))]−= 1
2[p(t), mω2q2(t)]−= −iℏmω2q(t) = iℏ˙p(t).
For the Hamiltonian, it follows from [a, a†]−= I that
H(q(t), p(t)) = ℏω(a†a + 1
2).
(7.22)
Matrix elements. Let us use the results from Sect. 7.2. Recall that the states

n = 0, 1, 2, ...

tion, ϕn ∈S(R) for all n. For the physical interpretation of Heisenberg’s quantum

mechanics, inﬁnite-dimensional matrices play a crucial role. Let us discuss this. We
assign to each linear operator A : S(R) →S(R) the matrix elements
Amn := ⟨ϕm|Aϕn⟩,
m, n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
For two linear formally self-adjoint operators A, B : S(R) →S(R), we get the
product rule
(AB)mn =

X
k=0
AmkBkn,
m, n = 0, 1, 2, ...

In fact, by the Parseval equation (7.2), this follows from
⟨ϕm|ABϕn⟩= ⟨Aϕm|Bϕn⟩=

k=0
⟨Aϕm|ϕk⟩⟨ϕk|Bϕn⟩
along with ⟨Aϕm|ϕk⟩= ⟨ϕm|Aϕk⟩.
Examples. Let us now compute the matrix elements of H, q(t), and p(t). It
follows from Nϕn = nϕn that
Hϕn = ℏω(N + 1
2I)ϕn = ℏω(n + 1
2)ϕn.
Hence Hmn = ⟨ϕm|Hϕn⟩= En⟨ϕm|ϕn⟩= Enδnm with En = ℏω(n+ 1

7.3.2 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Inequality for the Harmonic
Oscillator
In order to discuss the physical meaning of the matrices introduced above, we will
use the following terminology:
• The elements ψ of the complex Hilbert space L2(R) normalized by the condition
⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1 are called normalized states of the quantum harmonic oscillator,
• whereas the linear, formally self-adjoint operators A : S(R) →S(R) are called
formal observables.
Two normalized states ψ and ϕ are called equivalent iﬀ
ϕ = eiαψ
for some real number α. We say that ϕ and ψ diﬀer by phase. Consider some
normalized state ψ and some formal observable A. The number
¯A := ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩
is interpreted as the mean value of the observable A measured in the state ψ.19
Moreover, the nonnegative number ΔA given by
(ΔA)2 := ⟨ψ|(A −¯A)2ψ⟩
is interpreted as the ﬂuctuation of the measured mean value ¯A. Let us choose
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
For the state ϕn of the quantum harmonic oscillator, we get the
following measured values for all times t ∈R.
(i) Energy: ¯E = En = ℏω(n + 1
2) and ΔE = 0.
(ii) Position: ¯q(t) = qnn(t) = 0 and Δq(t) = x0
q
n + 1
2.
(iii) Momentum: ¯p(t) = pnn(t) = 0 and Δp(t) =
ℏ
x0
q
n + 1
2.
(iv) Heisenberg’s uncertainty inequality:
Δq(t)Δp(t) ≥ℏ
2 .
Let us prove this.
Ad (i). For the energy, it follows from the eigensolution Hϕn = Enϕn that
¯E = ⟨ϕn|Hϕn⟩= En⟨ϕn|ϕn⟩= En,
and ΔE = ||(H −EnI)ϕn|| = 0.
19 Since the operator A is formally self-adjoint, the number ¯A is real. Furthermore,
note that ⟨ψ|(A −¯A)2ψ⟩= ⟨(A −¯A)ψ|(A −¯A)ψ⟩= ||(A −¯AI)ψ||2 ≥0.

7.3 Heisenberg’s Quantum Mechanics
447
Ad (ii). Note that
(Δq)2 = ⟨ϕn|q(t)2ϕn⟩.
Therefore, (Δq)2 is the nth diagonal element of the product matrix (qkn)2 which
can be found in (7.25). Analogously, we get (iii). The uncertainty inequality is an
immediate consequence of (ii) and (iii).
2
The famous Heisenberg uncertainty inequality for the quantum harmonic os-
cillator tells us that the state ϕn has the sharp energy En, but it is impossible
to measure sharply both position and momentum of the quantum particle at the
same time. Thus, there exists a substantial diﬀerence between classical particles
and quantum particles.
It is impossible to speak of the trajectory of a quantum particle.
7.3.3 Quantization of Energy
I have the best of reasons for being an admirer of Werner Heisenberg.
He and I were young research students at the same time, about the same
age, working on the same problem. Heisenberg succeeded where I failed. . .
Heisenberg - a graduate student of Sommerfeld - was working from the
experimental basis, using the results of spectroscopy, which by 1925 had
accumulated an enormous amount of data20. . .
Paul Dirac, 1968
The measured spectrum of an atom or a molecule is characterized by two quantities,
namely,
• the wave length λnm of the emitted spectral lines (where n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . with
n > m), and
• the intensity of the spectral lines.
In Bohr’s and Sommerfeld’s semi-classical approach to the spectra of atoms and
molecules from the years 1913 and 1916, respectively, the spectral lines correspond
to photons which are emitted by jumps of an electron from one orbit of the atom or
molecule to another orbit. If E0 < E1 < E2 < . . . are the (discrete) energies of the
electron corresponding to the diﬀerent orbits, then a jump of the electron from the
higher energy level En to the lower energy level Em produces the emission of one
photon of energy En −Em. According to Einstein’s light quanta hypothesis from
1905, this yields the frequency
νnm = En −Em
h
,
n > m
(7.26)
of the emitted photon, and hence the wave length λnm = c/νnm of the corresponding
spectral line is obtained. The intensity of the spectral lines depends on the transition
probabilities for the jumps of the electrons. In 1925 it was Heisenberg’s philosophy
to base his new quantum mechanics only on quantities which can be measured in
physical experiments, namely,
• the energies E0, E1, . . . of bound states and

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• the transition probabilities for changing bound states.21
Explicitly, Heisenberg replaced the trajectory q = q(t), t ∈R of a particle in classical
mechanics by the following family (qnm(t)) of functions
qnm(t) = qnm(0)eiωnmt,
n, m = 0, 1, 2, . . .
where ωnm = 2πνnm, and the frequencies νnm are given by (7.26). It follows from
(7.26) that
νnk + νkm = νnm,
n < k < m.
In physics, this is called the Ritz combination principle for frequencies.22 In terms
of mathematics, this tells us that the family {νnm} of frequencies represents a
cocycle generated by the family {En} of energies. Thus, this approach is based on a
simple variant of cohomology.23 In order to compute the intensities of spectral lines,
Heisenberg was looking for a suitable quadratic expression in the amplitudes qnm(0).
Using physical arguments and analogies with the product formula for Fourier series
expansions, Heisenberg invented the composition rule
(q2(0))nm :=
∞
X
k=0
qnk(0)qkm(0)
(7.27)
for deﬁning the square (qnm(0))2 of the scheme (qnm(0)). Applying this to the har-
monic oscillator (and the anharmonic oscillator as a perturbed harmonic oscillator),
Heisenberg obtained the energies
En = ωℏ(n + 1
2),
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
for the quantized harmonic oscillator.
After getting Heisenberg’s manuscript, Born (1882–1970) noticed that the com-
position rule (7.27) resembled the product for matrices q(t) = (qnm(t)), which he
learned as a student in the mathematics course. He guessed the validity of the rule
qp −pq = iℏ.
(7.28)
But he was only able to verify this for the diagonal elements. After a few days of
joint work with his pupil Pascal Jordan (1902–1980), Born ﬁnished a joint paper
with Jordan on the new quantum mechanics including the commutation rule (7.28);
nowadays this is called the Heisenberg–Born–Jordan commutation rule (or brieﬂy
the Heisenberg commutation rule). At that time, Heisenberg was not in G¨ottingen,
but on the island Helgoland (North Sea) in order to cure a severe attack of hay
fever. After coming back to G¨ottingen, Heisenberg wrote together with Born and
Jordan a fundamental paper on the principles of quantum mechanics. The English
translation of the following three papers can be found in van der Waerden (1968):
21 Heisenberg’s thinking was strongly inﬂuenced by the Greek philosopher Plato
(428–347 B.C.). Nowadays one uses the Latin version ‘Plato’. The correct Greek
name is ‘Platon’. Plato’s Academy in Athens had unparalleled importance for
Greek thought. The greatest philosophers, mathematicians, and astronomers
worked there. For example, Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) studied there. In 529 A.D.,
the Academy was closed by the Roman emperor Justitian.
22 Ritz (1878–1909) worked in G¨ottingen.
23 The importance of cohomology for classical and quantum physics will be studied
in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics.

Heisenberg, himself, pointed out the following at the Trieste Evening Lectures in
1968:
It turned out that one could replace the quantum conditions of Bohr’s
theory by a formula which was essentially equivalent to the sum-rule in
spectroscopy by Thomas and Kuhn. . . I was however not able to get a
neat mathematical scheme out of it. Very soon afterwards both Born and
Jordan in G¨ottingen and Dirac in Cambridge were able to invent a perfectly
closed mathematical scheme: Dirac with very ingenious new methods on
abstract noncommutative q-numbers (i.e., quantum-theoretical numbers),
and Born and Jordan with more conventional methods of matrices.
7.3.4 The Transition Probabilities
Let us discuss the meaning of the entries qkn of the position matrix on page 445.
Suppose that the quantum particle is an electron of electric charge −e and mass
m. Let ε0 and c be the electric ﬁeld constant and the velocity of light of a vacuum,
respectively. Furthermore, let h be the Planck action quantum, and set ℏ:= h/2π.24
According to Heisenberg, the real number
γkn := ω3
kne2(t2 −t1)
3πε0ℏc3
|qkn(0)|2,
n, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n ̸= k
(7.29)
is the transition probability for the quantum particle to pass from the state ϕk to
the state ϕn during the time interval [t1, t2]. Here, ωkn := (Ek −En)/ℏ. This will
be motivated below. Note that γkn = γnk. Explicitly,
γkn := ω2e2(t2 −t1)
6πε0c3m
(nδk,n−1 + kδn,k−1).
This means the following.
• Forbidden spectral lines: The transition of the quantum particle from the state
ϕn of energy En to the state ϕk of energy Ek is forbidden, i.e., γkn = 0, if the
energy diﬀerence En −Ek is equal to ±2ℏω, ±3ℏω, ...
• Emission of radiation: The transition probability from the energy En+1 to the
energy En during the time interval [t1, t2] is equal to
γn+1,n = ω2e2(t2 −t1)
6πε0c3m
(n + 1),
n = 0, 1, 2, ...
(7.30)
In this case, a photon of energy E = ℏω is emitted. The meaning of transition
probability is the following. Suppose that we have N oscillating electrons in the
24 The numerical values can be found on page 949 of Vol. I.

450
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
state ϕn. Then the number of electrons which jump to the state ϕn+1 during the
time interval [t1, t −2] is equal to Nγn,n+1. Then the emitted mean energy E,
which passes through a suﬃciently large sphere during the time interval [t1, t2],
is equal to
E = Nγn+1,n · ℏω.
This quantity determines the intensity of the emitted spectral line.
• Absorption of radiation: The transition probability from the energy En to the
energy En+1 during the time interval [t1, t2] is equal to
γn,n+1 = γn+1,n,
n = 0, 1, 2, ...
In this case, a photon of energy En+1 −En = ℏω is absorbed.
Motivation of the transition probability. We want to motivate formula
(7.29).
Step 1: Classical particle. Let q = q(t) describe the motion of a classical particle
of mass m and electric charge −e on the real line. This particle emits the mean
electromagnetic energy E through a suﬃciently large sphere during the time interval
[t1, t2]. Explicitly,
E = e2(t2 −t1)
6πε0c3
mean(¨q2(t))
(see Landau and Lifshitz (1982), Sect. 67). We assume that the smooth motion of
the particle has the time period T. Then we have the Fourier expansion
q(t) =
∞
X
r=−∞
qreiωrt,
t ∈R
with the angular frequency ω := 2π/T and ωr := rω. Since the function t →q(t) is
real, we get qr(t)† = q−r(t) for all r = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . Hence
¨q2(t) =

Since mean

This yields E = P∞

Step 2: Quantum particle. In 1925 Heisenberg postulated that, for the har-
monic oscillator, the passage from the classical particle to the quantum particle
corresponds to the two replacements
(i) ωr ⇒ωkn := (Ek −En)/ℏ, and
(ii) qr ⇒qkn(0).

7.3 Heisenberg’s Quantum Mechanics
451
Let k > n. If the quantum particle jumps from the energy level Ek to the lower
energy level En, then a photon of energy Ek −En = ℏωkn is emitted. Using the
replacements (i) and (ii) above, we get E = P

By deﬁnition, the real number

k > n
is the transition probability for a passage of the quantum particle from the energy
level Ek to the lower energy level En during the time interval [t1, t2]. From (7.24)
we get |qkn(0)|2 =
ℏ
2mω kδn,k−1. Hence γkn = 0 for the choice k = n + 2, n + 3, . . .

This motivates the claim (7.30).
7.3.5 The Wightman Functions
Both the Wightman functions and the correlation functions of the quan-
tized harmonic oscillator are the prototypes of general constructions used
in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Folklore
As we have shown, the motion of the quantum particle corresponding to the quan-
tized harmonic oscillator is described by the time-depending operator function
q(t) = x0
√
2
(a†eiωt + ae−iωt),
t ∈R
(7.31)
with the initial condition q(0) = Q and p(0) = P. Using this, we deﬁne the n-point
Wightman function of the quantized harmonic oscillator by setting
Wn(t1, t2, . . . , tn) := ⟨0|q(t1)q(t2) · · · q(tn)|0⟩
(7.32)
for all times t1, t2, . . . , tn ∈R. This is the vacuum expectation value of the op-
erator product q(t1)q(t2) · · · q(tn). In contrast to the operator function (7.31), the
Wightman functions are classical complex-valued functions. It turns out that
The Wightman functions know all about the quantized harmonic oscillator.
Using the Wightman functions, we avoid the use of operator theory in Hilbert space.
This is the main idea behind the introduction of the Wightman functions.
Proposition 7.4 (i) W2(t, s) =

points t1, t2, t3, t4 ∈R.
(iv) Wn(t1, t2, . . . , tn)† = W(tn, . . . , t2, t1) for all times t1, t2, . . . tn and all pos-
itive integers n.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Proof. We will systematically use the orthonormal system ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . introduced
on page 433 together with aϕ0 = 0, a†ϕ0 = ϕ1 and
aϕn = √n ϕn−1,
a†ϕn =
√
n + 1 ϕn+1,
n = 1, 2, . . .
Recall that the vacuum state ϕ0 is also denoted by |0⟩. The computation of vacuum
expectation values becomes extremely simple when using the intuitive meaning of
the operator a (resp. a†) as a particle creation (resp. annihilation) operator. Let us
explain this by considering a few typical examples. First let us show that most of
the vacuum expectation values vanish.
• The state a†a†ϕ0 contains two particles. Hence
⟨ϕ0|a†a†ϕ0⟩= const · ⟨ϕ0|ϕ2⟩= 0,
by orthogonality.
• The state aa†a†ϕ0 contains one particle. Hence
⟨ϕ0|aa†a†ϕ0⟩= const · ⟨ϕ0|ϕ1⟩= 0.
• Aaϕ0 = 0 for arbitrary expressions A, since aϕ0 = 0.
• Analogously, aaaa†a†ϕ0 = 0. In fact,
aaaa†a†ϕ0 = a(aaa†a†)ϕ0 = const · aϕ0 = 0.
Formally, the state aaaa†a†ϕ0 contains “2 minus 3” particles. In general, states
with a ‘negative’ number of particles are equal to zero.
Therefore, it only remains to compute vacuum expectation values ⟨ϕ0|Aϕ0⟩where
the state Aϕ0 contains no particle.
This means that A is a product of creation and annihilation operators
where the number of creation operators equals the number of annihilation
operators.
The following examples will be used below.
• The state aa†ϕ0 contains no particle. Here,
aa†ϕ0 = aϕ1 = ϕ0.
(7.33)
Hence ⟨ϕ0|aa†ϕ0⟩= ϕ0|ϕ0⟩= 1.
• The state aaa†a†ϕ0 contains no particle. Explicitly,
aaa†a†ϕ0 = aaa†ϕ1 =
√
2 aaϕ2 = 2aϕ1 = 2ϕ0.
(7.34)
Hence ⟨ϕ0|aaa†a†ϕ0⟩= 2.
• Similarly,
aa†aa†ϕ0 = aa†aϕ1 = aa†ϕ0 = aϕ1 = ϕ0.
(7.35)
Hence ⟨aa†aa†ϕ0⟩= 1.

Ad (ii). First note that ⟨ϕ0|(a† + a)ϕ0⟩= ⟨ϕ0|ϕ1⟩= 0. The state
Aϕ0 := (a†
1 + a1)(a†
2 + a2)(a†
3 + a3)ϕ0
is the sum of particle states with an odd number of particles. Hence we obtain
⟨ϕ0|Aϕ0⟩= 0, by orthogonality. The same is true for an odd number of factors
(a†
j + aj).
Ad (iii). We have W4(t1, t2, t3, t4) = ⟨ϕ0|Aϕ0⟩with the state
Aϕ0 := (a†

The dots denote terms whose contribution to W4 vanishes. By (7.34) and (7.35),
W4(t1, t2, t3, t4) is equal to
⟨ϕ0|a1a2a†
3a†
4ϕ0⟩+ ⟨ϕ0|a1a†
2a3a†
4ϕ0⟩= 2W2(t1, t3)W2(t2, t4)
+W2(t1, t2)W2(t3, t4).
Ad (iv). Since the operator Q(t) is formally self-adjoint,
⟨ϕ0|Q(s)Q(t)ϕ0⟩= ⟨Q(t)Q(s)ϕ0|ϕ0⟩= ⟨ϕ0|Q(t)Q(s)ϕ0⟩†.
Hence W2(s, t) = W2(t, s)†. The general case proceeds analogously.

Similar arguments for computing vacuum expectation values via creation
and annihilation operators are frequently used in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Theorem 7.5 (i) Equation of motion: For any s ∈R, the 2-point Wightman func-
tion t →W2(t, s) satisﬁes the classical equation of motion for the harmonic oscil-
lator, that is,
∂2W2(t, s)
∂t2
+ ω2W2(t, s) = 0,
t ∈R.
(ii) Reconstruction property: For all times t, s ∈R,
q(t −s) =
√

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Relation (7.5) tells us that the knowledge of the 2-point Wightman function
W2 allows us to reconstruct the quantum dynamics of the harmonic oscillator.
Proof. Note that ¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = 0, and hence
∂2W(t, s)
∂2t
+ ω2W(t, s) = ⟨ϕ0|(¨q(t) + ω2q(t))q(s)ϕ0⟩= 0.

Perspectives. In 1956 Wightman showed that it is possible to base quantum
ﬁeld theory on the investigation of the vacuum expectation values of the products of
quantum ﬁelds. These vacuum expectation values are called Wightman functions.
The crucial point is that the Wightman functions are highly singular objects in
quantum ﬁeld theory. In fact, they are generalized functions.25 However, they are
also boundary values of holomorphic functions of several complex variables. This
simpliﬁes the mathematical theory. Using a similar construction as in the proof
of the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal (GNS) representation theorem for C∗-algebras in
Hilbert spaces, Wightman proved a reconstruction theorem which shows that the
quantum ﬁeld (as a Hilbert-space valued distribution) can be reconstructed from
its Wightman distributions. Basic papers are:

7.3.6 The Correlation Functions
In contrast to the Wightman functions, the correlation functions reﬂect
causality.
Folklore
Parallel to (7.32), we now deﬁne the n-point correlation function (also called the
n-point Green’s function) by setting
Cn(t1, t2, . . . , tn) := ⟨0|T (q(t1)q(t2) · · · q(tn))|0⟩
(7.37)
for all times t1, t2, . . . , tn ∈R. Here, the symbol T denotes the time-ordering oper-
ator, that is, we deﬁne
T (q(t1)q(t2) · · · q(tn)) := q(tπ(1))q(tπ(2)) · · · q(tπ(n))
where the permutation π of the indices 1, 2, . . . , n is chosen in such a way that
tπ(1) ≥tπ(2) ≥. . . ≥tπ(n). For example, using the slightly modiﬁed Heaviside
function θ∗, we obtain26
26 We set θ∗(t) := 1 if t > 0, θ∗(t) := 0 if t < 0, and θ∗(0) := 1
2.

7.3 Heisenberg’s Quantum Mechanics

C2(t, s) = θ∗(t −s)W2(t, s) + θ∗(s −t)W2(s, t)) = x2
0
2 · e−iω|t−s|
(7.38)
for all t, s ∈R. This relates the 2-point correlation function C2 to the 2-point
Wightman function W2 by taking causality into account. In particular, we have
C2(t, s) = W2(t, s) if t ≥s.
Theorem 7.6 For any s ∈R, the 2-point correlation function t →C2(t, s) satisﬁes
the inhomogeneous classical equation of motion for the harmonic oscillator, that is,
∂2C2(t, s)
∂t2
+ ω2C2(t, s) = ℏ
mi · δ(t −s),
t ∈R,
(7.39)
in the sense of tempered distributions on the real line.
This theorem tells us that the function F(t) := mi
ℏ· C2(t, 0) satisﬁes the diﬀerential
equation
¨F(t) + ω2F(t) = δ(t),
t ∈R.
In terms of mathematics, the function F is a fundamental solution of the diﬀerential
operator
d2
dt2 + ω2, in the sense of tempered distributions (see Sect. 11.7 of Vol. I).
The language of mathematicians. In order to prove Theorem 7.6, we will
use the theory of generalized functions (distributions) introduced in Chap. 11 of
Vol. I. Let ψ ∈S(R). Integrating by parts twice, we get
Z ∞
s
e−iω(t−s) ¨ψ(t)dt = −˙ψ(s) +
Z ∞
s
iωe−iω(t−s) ˙ψ(t)dt
= −˙ψ(s) −iωψ(s) −ω2
Z ∞
s
e−iω(t−s)ψ(t)dt.
Similarly,
Z s
−∞
e−iω(s−t) ¨ψ(t)dt = ˙ψ(s) −iωψ(s) −ω2
Z s

e−iω(s−t)ψ(t)dt.
Hence
Z ∞
−∞
e−iω|t−s| ¨ψ(t)dt = −2iωψ(s) −ω2
Z ∞

e−iω|t−s| ψ(t)dt.
In terms of distribution theory, this is equivalent to
∂2e−iω|t−s|
∂t2
+ ω2e−iω|t−s| = −2iωδ(t −s),
t ∈R.

The language of physicists. We want to show how to obtain the claim of
Theorem 7.6 by using Dirac’s delta function in a formal setting.27 For ﬁxed s ∈R,
consider
C(t) := θ∗(t −s)W(t) + θ∗(s −t)Z(t),
t ∈R.
Diﬀerentiating this with respect to time t by means of the product rule and noting
that ˙θ∗(t) = δ(t), we get
˙C(t) = δ(t −s)W(t) −δ(s −t)Z(t) + θ∗(t −s) ˙W(t) + θ∗(s −t) ˙Z(t).
27 Both the formal Dirac calculus and its relations to the rigorous theory are thor-
oughly investigated in Sect. 11.2ﬀof Vol. I.

458
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Using δ(t −s) = δ(s −t) and δ(t) = 0 if t ̸= 0, we obtain
˙C(t) = δ(t −s)(W(s) −Z(s)) + θ∗(t −s) ˙W(t) + θ∗(s −t) ˙Z(t).
Hence
¨C(t) = ˙δ(t −s)(W(s) −Z(s)) + δ(t −s)( ˙W(s) −˙Z(s))
+θ∗(t −s) ¨
W(t) + θ∗(s −t) ¨Z(t).
Choosing C(t) := C2(t) and
W(t) := W2(t, s) = x2
0
2 e−iω(t−s)
together with Z(t) := W2(s, t), we get the diﬀerential equation (7.39) above.
The physical meaning of correlation functions for the harmonic os-
cillator. Let ϕ ∈L2(R) with ⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩= 1. We regard ϕ as a physical state of the
quantized harmonic oscillator on the real line. The operator function q = q(t), t ∈R
from (7.31) on page 451 describes the motion of the quantum particle. According
to the general approach introduced in Sect. 7.9 of Vol. I, we assign to the state ϕ
the following real numbers:
(i) Mean position of the particle in the state ϕ at time t: ¯q(t) := ⟨ϕ|q(t)|ϕ⟩.
(ii) Mean ﬂuctuation of the particle position at time t:
Δq(t) :=
p
⟨ϕ|(q(t) −¯q(t))2ϕ⟩.
(iii) Correlation coeﬃcient: For t, s ∈R, we deﬁne
γ(t, s) := (q(t) −¯q(t))(q(s) −¯q(s))
Δq(t)Δq(s)
.
By the Schwarz inequality, |γ(t, s)| ≤1. If |γ(t, s)| = 1 (resp. γ(t, s) = 0), then
the position of the particle in the state ϕ at time t is strongly correlated (resp.
not correlated) to the position in the state ϕ at time s.
(iv) Causal correlation coeﬃcient:
γcausal(t, s) := γ(t, s)
if t ≥s.
Furthermore, γcausal(t, s) := γ(s, t) if s ≥t.
(v) Transition amplitude: Let ϕ, ψ ∈L2(R) with ⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1. The complex
number ⟨ψ|q(t)ϕ⟩is called the transition amplitude (for the position) from the
state ϕ to the state ψ at time t.
To illustrate this, consider the ground state ϕ0 of the harmonic oscillator. Then
W2(t, s) =
ℏ
2mω e−iω(t−s). Thus, in the ground state, we have:
• Mean position ¯q(t) = 0.
• Mean ﬂuctuation: Δq(t) =
p
⟨ϕ0|q(t)q(t)ϕ0⟩=
p
W2(t, t) =
q
ℏ
2mω .
• Correlation coeﬃcient:
γ(t, s) =
W2(t, s)
p
W2(t, t)
p
W2(s, s)
= e−iω(t−s),
t ≥s,
and γcausal(t, s) = e−iω|t−s|. Hence |γ(t, s)| = 1. This means that, in the ground
state, the position of the quantum particle at time t is strongly correlated to the
position at time s.

7.4 Schr¨odinger’s Quantum Mechanics
459
• Transition amplitude from the state ϕ0 to the state ϕn:
⟨ϕ1|q(t)ϕ0⟩= eiωt,
⟨ϕn|q(t)ϕ0⟩= 0,
n = 2, 3, 2, . . .
By (7.29), the transition probability γn0 for passing from the state ϕ0 to the state
ϕn during the time interval [t1, t2] is proportional to |⟨ϕn|q(0)ϕ0⟩|2. Explicitly,
γ10 = ω2e2(t2−t1)
6πε0c3m
and γn0 = 0 if n = 2, 3, . . .
7.4 Schr¨odinger’s Quantum Mechanics
In particular, I would like to mention that I was mainly inspired by the
thoughtful dissertation of Mr. Louis de Broglie (Paris, 1924). The main
diﬀerence here lies in the following. De Broglie thinks of travelling waves,
while, in the case of the atom, we are led to standing waves. . . I am most
thankful to Hermann Weyl with regard to the mathematical treatment of
the equation of the hydrogen atom.28
Erwin Schr¨odinger, 1926
7.4.1 The Schr¨odinger Equation
In 1926 Schr¨odinger invented wave quantum mechanics based on a wave function
ψ = ψ(x, t). The Schr¨odinger equation for the motion of a quantum particle of mass
m on the real line is given by
iℏψt = −ℏ2
2mψxx + Uψ.
(7.40)
Explicitly, the Schr¨odinger equation reads as
iℏ∂ψ(x, t)
∂t
= −ℏ2
2m
∂2ψ(x, t)
∂2x
+ U(x)ψ(x, t).
Schr¨odinger’s quantization. The Schr¨odinger equation (7.40) is obtained by
applying Schr¨odinger quantization to the classical energy equation
E = p2
2m + U.
(7.41)
This means that we replace the classical momentum p and the classical energy E
by diﬀerential operators. Explicitly,
E ⇒iℏ∂
∂t,
p ⇒−iℏ∂
∂x.
From (7.41) we get
iℏ∂
∂t = −ℏ2
2m
∂2
∂x2 + U.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Applying this to the function ψ, we obtain the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equa-
tion (7.40). Schr¨odinger generalized this in a straightforward manner to three di-
mensions, and he computed the spectrum of the hydrogen atom.
The physical interpretation of the wave function ψ. If the potential U
vanishes, U ≡0, then the function
ψ0(x, t) := Ce−iE(p)t/ℏeipx/ℏ
is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation (7.40). Here, C is a ﬁxed complex number,
p is a ﬁxed real number, and E(p) :=
p2
2m. The function ψ0 corresponds to a stream
of freely moving electrons on the real line with momentum p and energy E(p).
There arises the following question:
What is the physical meaning of the function ψ = ψ(x, t) in the general
case?
Interestingly enough, Schr¨odinger did not know the answer when publishing his
paper in 1926. The answer was found by Born a few months later.
By applying the Schr¨odinger equation to scattering processes, Born discov-
ered the random character of quantum processes.
According to Born, we have to distinguish the following two cases:
(i) Single quantum particle: Suppose that 0 <
R
R |ψ(x)|2dx < ∞. Then, the value
ϱ(x, t) :=
|ψ(x, t)|2
R
R |ψ(x, t)|2dx
represents the particle probability density at position x at time t. That is, the
value
Z
J
ϱ(x, t)dx
is equal to the probability of ﬁnding the particle in the interval J at time t.
Naturally enough,
R
R ϱ(x, t)dx = 1. If we measure the position x of the quantum
particle, then the mean position ¯x and the ﬂuctuation Δx of the position at
time t are given by
¯x(t) =
Z
R
xϱ(x, t)dx
and
(Δx)2 = (x −¯x)2 =
Z
R
(x −¯x)2ϱ(x, t)dx.
By deﬁnition, Δx is non-negative. In the theory of probability, a fundamental
inequality due to Chebyshev (1821–1894) tells us that
P(¯x −rΔx ≤x ≤¯x + rΔx) ≥1 −1
r2
for all r > 0. In particular, choose r = 4. Then this inequality tells us that the
probability of measuring the position x of the quantum particle in the interval
[¯x −4Δx, ¯x + 4Δx] is larger than 1 −
1
16 = 0.93.

7.4 Schr¨odinger’s Quantum Mechanics
461
(ii) Stream of quantum particles: Suppose that
R
R |ψ(x, t))|2dx = ∞. Then, the
function ψ corresponds to a stream of particles on the real line with the particle
density
ϱ(x, t) := |ψ(x, t)|2,
x ∈R, t ∈R,
and the current density vector
J(x, t) = J (x, t)e,
x ∈R, t ∈R
at the point x at time t. Here, the unit vector e points in direction of the
positive x-axis, and we deﬁne
J := iℏ
2m(ψψ†
x −ψ†ψx).
This deﬁnition is motivated by the fact that each smooth solution ψ of the
Schr¨odinger equation (7.40) satisﬁes the following conservation law29
ϱt + div J = 0.
(7.42)
Explicitly, div J = Jx. For a < b, this implies the relation
Z b
a
ϱ(x, t)dx = J (a, t) −J (b, t)
which describes the change of the particle number on the interval [a, b] by the
particle stream. For example, the function
ψ0(x, t) = Ce−iE(p)t/ℏeipx/ℏ
corresponds to a stream of quantum particles with the constant particle density
ϱ(x, t) = |C|2, the velocity v = p/m, and the current density vector
J = vϱe.
There exist fascinating long-term developments in mathematics. In his books “Ge-
ometry“ and “Algebra” from 1550 and 1572, respectively, Bombielli (1526–1572)
systematically used the symbol √−1 in order to solve algebraic equations of third
and fourth order. Almost 400 years later, the physicist Schr¨odinger used the number
i = √−1 in order to formulate the basic equations of quantum mechanics. We are
going to show that the use of complex numbers is substantial for quantum physics.
Freeman Dyson writes in his foreword to Odifreddi’s book:30
One of the most profound jokes of nature is the square root of −1 that the
physicist Erwin Schr¨odinger put into his wave equation in 1926 . . . The
Schr¨odinger equation describes correctly everything we know about the be-
havior of atoms. It is the basis of all of chemistry and most of physics. And
that square root of −1 means that nature works with complex numbers.
This discovery came as a complete surprise, to Schr¨odinger as well as to
everybody else. According to Schr¨odinger, his fourteen-year-old girlfriend
Itha Junger said to him at the time: “Hey, you never even thought when
29 In fact, ϱt = (ψψ†)t = ψtψ† + ψψ†
t . By (7.40), ϱt = −Jx.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
you began that so much sensible stuﬀwould come out of it.” All through
the nineteenth century, mathematicians from Abel to Riemann and Weier-
strass had been creating a magniﬁcent theory of functions of complex vari-
ables. They had discovered that the theory of functions became far deeper
and more powerful if it was extended from real to complex numbers. But
they always thought of complex numbers as an artiﬁcial construction, in-
vented by human mathematicians as a useful and elegant abstraction from
real life. It never entered their heads that they had invented was in fact
the ground on which atoms move. They never imagined that nature had
got there ﬁrst.
In what follows, we want to show that the notion of Hilbert space is an appropriate
setting for describing quantum mechanics in terms of mathematics. Originally, the
special Hilbert space l2 (as an inﬁnite-dimensional variant of Rn) was introduced by
Hilbert in the beginning of the 20th century in order to study eigenvalue problems
for integral equations.
7.4.2 States, Observables, and Measurements
The Hilbert space approach. In 1926, the young Hungarian mathematician von
Neumann Janos came to G¨ottingen as Hilbert’s assistant.31 In G¨ottingen, von Neu-
mann learned about the new quantum mechanics of physicists. It was his goal to
give quantum mechanics a rigorous mathematical basis. As a mathematical frame-
work, he used the notion of Hilbert space. For example, in the present case of the
motion of a quantum particle on the real line, we choose the Hilbert space L2(R)
with the inner product
⟨ψ|χ⟩=
Z
R
ψ(x)†χ(x)dx
for all
ψ, χ ∈L2(R),
and the norm ||ψ|| :=
p
⟨ψ|ψ⟩. The general terminology reads as follows.
(S) States: Each nonzero element ψ of L2(R) is called a state. In terms of physics,
this describes a state of a single quantum particle on the real line. Two nonzero
elements ψ, χ of L2(R) represent equivalent states iﬀthere exists a nonzero
complex number μ with
ψ = μχ.
In terms of physics, equivalent states represent the same physical state of the
particle. The state ψ is called normalized iﬀ||ψ|| = 1.
(O) Observables: The linear, formally self-adjoint operators
A : D(A) ⊆X →X
are called formal observables. Explicitly, this means that the domain of deﬁ-
nition D(A) is a linear subspace of X. Moreover, for all ψ, χ ∈D(A) and all
complex numbers α, β, we have
31 Von Neumann (1903–1957) was born in Budapest (Hungary). He studied math-
ematics and chemistry in Berlin, Budapest, and Zurich. The German (resp. En-
glish) translation of the Hungarian name ‘Janos’ is Johann (resp. John). Von
Neumann was an extraordinarily gifted mathematician. He was known for his
ability to understand mathematical subjects and to solve mathematical prob-
lems extremely fast. In 1933, von Neumann got a professorship at the newly
founded Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey (U.S.A.).

7.4 Schr¨odinger’s Quantum Mechanics

A(αψ + βχ) = αAψ + βAχ
together with the symmetry condition ⟨ψ|Aχ⟩= ⟨Aψ|χ⟩.32
(M) Measurements: If we measure the formal observable A in the normalized state
ψ, then we get the mean value
¯A := ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩,
and the mean ﬂuctuation33
ΔA := ||(A −¯AI)ψ||.
(C) Correlation coeﬃcient: Let A, B : S(R) →S(R) be two formal observables.
The correlation coeﬃcient between A and B in the state ψ is deﬁned by
γ := Cov(A, B)
ΔA · ΔB
together with the covariance
Cov(A, B) := (A −¯AI)(B −¯BI) = ⟨ψ|(A −¯AI)(B −¯BI)ψ⟩.
Hence Cov(A, B) = ⟨(A −¯AI)ψ|(B −¯BI)ψ⟩.
By the Schwarz inequality, |γ| ≤1.
• If γ = 0, then there is no correlation between the formal observables A and B.
In other words, A and B are independent formal observables.
• If |γ| = 1, then the correlation between A and B is large. That is, the formal
observable A depends strongly on the formal observable B.
Proposition 7.7 The mean value is a real number.
This is a consequence of ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩† = ⟨Aψ|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩.

The following result underlines the importance of eigenvalue problems in quan-
tum mechanics.
Proposition 7.8 Suppose that the normalized state ψ is an eigenvector of the for-
mal observable A with eigenvalue λ,
Aψ = λψ.
Then, the measurement of A in the state ψ yields ¯A = λ and ΔA = 0.
32 For a deeper mathematical analysis, von Neumann introduced the stronger no-
tion of an observable. By deﬁnition, an observable is an essentially self-adjoint
operator (see Vol. I, p. 677).
33 Explicitly, (ΔA)2 = ⟨Aψ −¯Aψ|Aψ −¯Aψ⟩. If Aψ ∈D(A), then
(ΔA)2 = ⟨ψ|(A −¯AI)2ψ⟩= (A −¯AI)2.

464
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
In this case, we say that λ is a sharp value of the formal observable A. For the
proof, ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩= λ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= λ, and Aψ −¯Aψ = Aψ −λψ = 0.

Examples. The operators Q, P, H : S(R) →S(R) are deﬁned by
(Qψ)(x) := xψ(x),
(Pψ)(x) = −iℏψ′(x),
x ∈R,
for all functions ψ ∈S(R). We call Q and P the position operator and the momen-
tum operator, respectively. Moreover, we introduce the energy operator (Hamilto-
nian)
H := P 2
2m + U,
where we assume that U ∈S(R). Then the fundamental operator equation
iℏ˙ψ = Hψ
coincides with the Schr¨odinger equation (7.40).
Proposition 7.9 The operators Q, P, H : S(R) →S(R) are formally self-adjoint
on the Hilbert space L2(R), and there holds the commutation relation
QP −PQ = iℏI
on S(R).
(7.43)
Proof. The formal self-adjointness of Q and P together with (7.43) are proved on
page 436. Let ψ ∈S(R). The formal self-adjointness of H follows from
⟨ψ|P 2ψ⟩= ⟨Pψ|Pψ⟩= ⟨P 2ψ|ψ⟩.
Hence ⟨ψ|Hψ⟩= ⟨Hψ|ψ⟩.

7.4.3 The Free Motion of a Quantum Particle
The classical motion of a particle of mass m on the real line is governed by the
Hamiltonian H :=
p2
2m together with the canonical equations
˙q = Hp = p
m,
˙p = −Hq = 0.
For given initial position q(0) = q0 and initial velocity ˙q(0) = v, the unique solution
reads as q(t) = q0 + vt for all times t ∈R with the total energy
E(p) := p2
2m = mv2
2
.
The free motion of a quantum particle on the real line is governed by the Hamilto-
nian operator
H := P 2
2m.

Recall that P = −iℏd
dx, and hence
H = −ℏ2
2m

dx2 .

7.4 Schr¨odinger’s Quantum Mechanics
465
At this point, we regard the operators P and H as diﬀerential operators which act
on smooth functions (or on generalized functions).34 For the functional-analytic
approach to quantum mechanics, it is important to appropriately specify the domain
of deﬁnition of the operators under consideration. This will be discussed below. For
ﬁxed nonzero complex number C, deﬁne the functions
ϕp(x) := Ceipx/ℏ,
ψp(x, t) = ϕp(x)e−itE(p))/ℏ,
x, t ∈R.
Then the function ψp satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ˙ψp = Hψp.
Moreover, for all parameters p ∈R, we have
Pϕp = pϕp,
Hϕp = E(p)ϕp.
These equations remain valid if we replace ϕp by ψp. From the physical point of
view, the function ψp describes a homogeneous stream of quantum particles (e.g.,
electrons) with particle density ϱ = |C|2 and velocity v. Note that the functions ϕp
and x →ψp(x, t) do not live in the Hilbert space L2(R).
Let ϕ, χ ∈S(R). Normalizing the function ϕp above by C :=
1
√
2πℏ, we get the
Fourier transform
ˆϕ(p) =
Z
R
ϕp(x)†ϕ(x)dx,
p ∈R
together with the inverse transform
ϕ(x) =
Z
R
ϕp(x) ˆϕ(p)dp,
x ∈R.
The operator F : S(R) →S(R) is bijective (see Vol. I, p. 87). We write ˆϕ = Fϕ.
This Fourier transform can be uniquely extended to a unitary operator of the form
F : L2(R) →L2(R),s that is, we have
⟨ϕ|χ⟩= ⟨ˆϕ|ˆχ⟩,
for all
ϕ, χ ∈L2(R),
which is called the Parseval equation of the Fourier transform.
The quantum dynamics of a freely moving particle. Let us now study
the three operators
• P : S(R) →S(R) (momentum operator),
• Q : S(R) →S(R) position operator), and
• H : S(R) →S(R) (Hamiltonian).
These operators are formally self-adjoint on the Hilbert space L2(R). In the Fourier
space, the operators P and H correspond to the following multiplication operators
( ˆP ˆϕ)(p) = p ˆϕ(p),
( ˆH ˆϕ)(p) = E(p) ˆϕ(p),
p ∈R.
This holds for all ϕ ∈S(R), and hence for all ˆϕ ∈S(R). For given ϕ0 ∈S(R), the
quantum dynamics
ψ(t) = e−iHt/ℏϕ0,
t ∈R
is given in the Fourier space by the equation
34 The Schwartz S′(R) of tempered distributions and the Schwartz space D′(R) of
distributions are investigated in Sect. 11.3 of Vol. I. Here, S′(R) ⊂D′(R).

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
ˆψ(p, t) = e−iE(p)t/ℏˆϕ0(p),
p ∈R
for each time t ∈R. Transforming this back to the original Hilbert space L2(R) by
using the Fourier transform, we get the quantum dynamics
e−itH0/ℏϕ0 = F −1 ˆψ(t)
for all
t ∈R.
(7.45)
We have ψ(t) ∈S(R) for all times t ∈R, and this function satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger
equation for all times.35
The full quantum dynamics. Consider equation (7.45). Observe the fol-
lowing peculiarity. The right-hand side of (7.45) is well-deﬁned for initial states
ϕ0 ∈L2(R) if we do not use the classical Fourier transform, but the extended
Fourier transform F : L2(R) →L2(R). In this sense, we understand the dynamics
ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏϕ0,
t ∈R
for all initial states ϕ0 ∈L2(R). In terms of functional analysis, for any ﬁxed time
t, the operator e−itH/ℏ: L2(R) →L2(R) is unitary. Therefore, e−itH/ℏϕ0 makes
sense for all ϕ0 ∈L2(R). In this general setting, the function
ψ : [0, +∞[→L2(R)
is continuous, but not necessarily diﬀerentiable. Therefore, it can be regarded as a
generalized solution of the Schr¨odinger equation iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t), t ∈R.
Measurement of observables. Suppose that we are given a normalized state
ϕ ∈S(R), that is,
||ϕ||2 =
Z
R
|ϕ(x)|2dx = 1.
By the Parseval equation,
|| ˆϕ||2 =
Z
R
| ˆϕ(p)|2dp = ||ϕ||2 = 1.
Let us now measure the position, the momentum, and the energy of a quantum
particle on the real line where the particle is in the normalized state ϕ ∈S(R).
(i) Measurement of position: For the mean value ¯x and the mean ﬂuctuation Δx ≥0
of the particle position, we get
¯x = ⟨ϕ|Qϕ⟩=
Z
R
x|ϕ(x)|2dx
and
(Δx)2 = ⟨ϕ|(Q −¯xI)2ϕ⟩=
Z
R
(x −¯x)2|ϕ(x)|2dx.
The number
R
J |ϕ(x)|2dx is the probability for measuring the particle position
in the interval J.
35 Fix t ∈R. The symbol ψ(t) (resp. ˆψ(t)) stands for the function x →ψ(x, t)
(resp. p →ˆψ(p, t)) on R.

(ii) Measurement of momentum: For the mean value ¯p and the mean ﬂuctuation
Δp of the particle momentum, we get
¯p = ⟨ϕ|Pϕ⟩= ⟨ˆϕ| ˆP ˆϕ⟩=

p | ˆϕ(p)|2dp
and
Δp = ⟨ϕ|(P −¯pI)2ϕ⟩=

(p −¯p)2| ˆϕ(p)|2dp.
The number
R
J | ˆϕ(p)|2dp is the probability for measuring the particle momen-
tum in the interval J.
(iii) Measurement of energy: Suppose we are given a measuring instrument which
analyzes the energy of freely moving particles. The measured energy corre-
sponds to the observable H. For the mean value ¯E and the mean ﬂuctuation
ΔE of the energy in the normalized state ϕ ∈S(R), we get
¯E = ⟨ϕ|Hϕ⟩= ⟨ˆϕ| ˆH ˆϕ⟩=
Z
R
E(p)| ˆϕ(p)|2dp
and
ΔE = ⟨ϕ|(H −¯EI)2ϕ⟩=
Z
R
(E(p) −¯E)2| ˆϕ(p)|2dp.
The number
Z
E(p)∈J
| ˆϕ(p)|2dp
is the probability for measuring the particle energy in the given energy interval
J. Recall that E(p) = p2/2m. Fix the positive real number E. Then we have
E(p) ≤E iﬀ|p|2 ≤2mE. Thus, the number
Z
|p|≤
√
2mE
| ˆϕ(p)|2dp
is equal to the probability for measuring the energy E(p) of the particle in the
interval [0, E].
The full functional-analytic approach to the free quantum particle will be studied
in Sect. 7.6.4 on page 509.
7.4.4 The Harmonic Oscillator
Let us quantize the classical harmonic oscillator in the sense of Schr¨odinger’s quan-
tum mechanics. We will see that we obtain the same results as in Heisenberg’s
version of quantum mechanics. In Sect. 7.4.5, we will explain why Schr¨odinger’s
quantum mechanics is equivalent to Heisenberg’s quantum mechanics. Choosing
ϕ ∈S(R), recall the deﬁnition of the position operator Q and the momentum
operator P,
(Qϕ)(x) := xϕ(x),
(Pϕ)(x) := −iℏϕ′(x)
for all
x ∈R.
Quantization means that we replace the classical Hamiltonian function

The Schr¨odinger equation for the wave function ψ = ψ(x, t), x, t ∈R, reads as

The Hamiltonian operator H knows all about the quantized harmonic os-
cillator.
This is a typical feature for all quantum systems. Making the classic Fourier ansatz
ψ(x, t) := ϕ(x)e−iEt/ℏ,
x, t ∈R,
we get the stationary Schr¨odinger equation

for the time-independent function ϕ. Explicitly,

The eigensolutions of the Hamiltonian. Our mathematical investigation of
the quantized harmonic oscillator will be based on the eigensolutions of the Hamil-

Physical interpretation. Let us discuss some physical consequences.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
(i) Ground state: The state
ψ(x, t) := e−iE0t/ℏϕ0(x),
t, x ∈R
represents the lowest-energy state of the harmonic oscillator called ground state
(or vacuum state). The sharp energy of the ground state equals E0 = ℏ/2. For
the mean position ¯x and the mean ﬂuctuation Δx of the particle position in
the ground state, it follows from Corollary 7.11 that
¯x = 0,
Δx = σ = x0
√

.
For the mean momentum ¯p and the mean ﬂuctuation Δp of the particle mo-
mentum in the ground state, we get ¯p = 0 and ΔxΔp = ℏ
2 .
(ii) The uncertainty inequality: In the normalized state
ψ(x, t) := e−iEnt/ℏϕn(x),
n = 0, 1, . . . ,
the particle has the sharp energy En = ℏω(n + 1

¯x = 0,

In 1927 Heisenberg discovered that this inequality is the special case of a fun-
damental law in nature called the uncertainty of position and momentum (see
Sect. 7.4.6 on page 475).
(iii) Measurement of energy: The energy states ϕ0, ϕ1, ... form a complete orthonor-
mal system in the Hilbert space L2(R).36 This means that we have the orthog-
onality relation
⟨ϕn|ϕm⟩=

ϕn(x)†ϕm(x)dx = δnm,

n|⟨ϕn|ψ⟩|2 < ∞. The operator H : D(H) →L2(R) is an extension
of the operator H : S(R) →L2(R). In fact, if ψ ∈S(R), then we obtain

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The quantum dynamics of the harmonic oscillator. For each initial state
ψ0 in L2(R) and each time t ∈R, we deﬁne
e−iHt/ℏψ0 :=

n=0
e−iEnt/ℏ⟨ϕn|ψ0⟩ϕn.
This series is convergent because of
∞
X
n=0
|e−iEnt/ℏ⟨ϕn|ψ0⟩|2 =

X
n=0
|⟨ϕn|ψ0⟩|2 = ||ψ0||2 < ∞.
By deﬁnition, the equation
ψ(t) = e−iHt/ℏψ0
for all
t ∈R
describes the dynamics of the quantum harmonic oscillator on the real line. The
following theorem motivates this deﬁnition.
Theorem 7.12 For each time t ∈R, the operator e−iHt/ℏ: L2(R) →L2(R) is
unitary.
For given initial value ψ0 ∈D(H), the function ψ(t) := e−iHt/ℏψ0 satisﬁes the
Schr¨odinger equation iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t) for all times t ∈R.
Proof. For each ψ0 ∈L2(R) and all t, s ∈R,
e−iHs/ℏ(e−iℏHt/ℏψ0) =
∞
X
n=0
e−iEns/ℏe−iEnt/ℏ⟨ϕn|ψ0⟩ϕn = e−iH(t+s)/ℏψ0.
Choosing s = −t, this implies
eiHt/ℏ(e−iHt/ℏψ0) = ψ0.
Thus, the operator eitH/ℏis the inverse operator to the operator e−itH/ℏon the
Hilbert space L2(R). Moreover, because of |e−iEnt/ℏ| = 1 it follows from the Par-
seval equation that
||e−itH/ℏψ0||2 =
∞
X
n=0
|e−itEn/ℏ|2|⟨ϕn|ψ0⟩|2 = ||ψ0||2.
Therefore, the operator e−iHt/ℏ: L2(R) →L2(R) is bijective and norm preserving,
i.e., this operator is unitary. In particular, if the initial state ψ0 is normalized, then
so is e−iHt/ℏψ0 for each time t ∈R.
Choose now ψ0 ∈D(H). Formal diﬀerentiation with respect to time t yields
iℏ˙ψ(t) =
∞
X
n=0
Ene−iEnt/ℏ⟨ϕn|ψ0⟩ϕn.
To justify this formal diﬀerentiation, it is suﬃcient to use the following majorant
series37

Transition probabilities. Let ψ0 and ψ1 be two normalized states in the
Hilbert space L2(R). By deﬁnition, the real number
τ := |⟨ψ1|e−iHt/ℏψ0⟩|2
represents the transition probability from the initial state ψ0 to the ﬁnal state ψ1
during the time interval [0, t]. In order to motivate this deﬁnition, observe that
• 0 ≤τ ≤1;
• τ = 1 for the ﬁnal state ψ1 := e−itH/ℏψ0;
• P∞
n=0 τn = 1 if τn corresponds to the ﬁnal energy state ϕn, i.e.,
τn := |⟨ϕn|e−iHt/ℏψ0⟩|2.
In fact, it follows from the Schwarz inequality that
τ ≤||ψ1|| · ||e−itH/ℏψ0|| = ||ψ1|| · ||ψ0|| = 1.
Moreover, ⟨e−iHt/ℏψ0|e−iHt/ℏψ0⟩= ⟨ψ0|ψ0⟩= 1. Finally,

7.4.5 The Passage to the Heisenberg Picture
Using the harmonic oscillator, we want to discuss in which sense the Heisenberg
approach to quantum mechanics is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger approach.
Formal approach. The basic transformation from the Schr¨odinger picture to
the Heisenberg picture reads as
ψ(t) →ψ(0),
A →A(t) := eiHt/ℏAe−iHt/ℏ
for all times t ∈R.
(S) Schr¨odinger picture: In this setting, the states ψ(t) of the quantum harmonic
oscillator on the real line are elements of the Hilbert space L2(R) which depend
on time t,
ψ(t) = e−iHt/ℏψ(0),
t ∈R.
The formal observables are formally self-adjoint operators
A : D(A) ⊆L2(R) →L2(R)
which do not depend on time t. Diﬀerentiating the state function t →ψ(t)
with respect to time t, we get the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t),
t ∈R.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
(H) Heisenberg picture: Here, the states ψ(0) of the quantum harmonic oscillator
are elements of the Hilbert space L2(R) which do not depend on time t. The
formal observables A(t) are operators on the Hilbert space L2(R) which depend
on time t. Diﬀerentiating the function t →A(t) with respect to time, we get
the Heisenberg equation
iℏ˙A(t) = A(t)H −HA(t),
t ∈R.
From the physical point of view, we are interested in measurements of quantities
in physical experiments. The point is that both the Schr¨odinger picture and the
Heisenberg picture yield the same mean values. Explicitly,
¯A(t) = ⟨ψ(t)|Aψ(t)⟩= ⟨ψ(0)|A(t)ψ(0)⟩.
Rigorous approach. Let us start with the Schr¨odinger picture for the quantum
harmonic oscillator on the real line. Consider the self-adjoint Hamiltonian H :
D(H) ⊆L2(R) →L2(R) introduced in Sect. 7.4.4. Explicitly,
Hϕ =
∞
X
n=0
En⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩ϕn.
Here, we have ϕ ∈D(H) iﬀthis series is convergent in the Hilbert space L2(R).
Deﬁne
D0(H) := span{ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, ...},
i.e., D0(H) is the set of ﬁnite linear combinations of the eigenfunctions ϕ0, ϕ1, ...
with complex coeﬃcients.
Theorem 7.13 Let A : S(R) →L2(R) be a formally self-adjoint operator which
maps D0(H) into itself. Then, for each ϕ ∈D0(H) and all times t ∈R, the expres-
sion
A(t)ϕ := eiHt/ℏAe−iHt/ℏϕ
is well-deﬁned, and we have the diﬀerential equation
iℏd
dt(A(t)ϕ) = (A(t)H −HA(t))ϕ.
Proof. All of the expressions are well-deﬁned, since they refer to ﬁnite linear combi-
nations of the eigenfunctions ϕ0, ϕ1, ... Note that e−iHt/ℏϕn is equal to e−iEnt/ℏϕn,
and we have Aϕn ∈D0(H) for all n.

Proof. To simplify notation, let x0 = ℏ= 1. It follows from the basic relations
eiHtϕn = eiEntϕn and aϕn = √n ϕn−1 that
eiHtaϕn = eiEn−1taϕn.
Noting that En = ω(n + 1
2),
eiHtae−iHtϕn = eiEn−1te−iEntaϕn = e−iωtaϕn.
Similarly, a†ϕn = √n + 1 ϕn+1 implies
eiHta†e−iHtϕn = eiEn+1teiEnta†ϕn = eiωta†ϕn.

The proof for P proceeds similarly.

7.4.6 Heisenberg’s Uncertainty Principle
In 1927 Heisenberg discovered that there exists a deep diﬀerence between classical
mechanics and quantum mechanics.38 He derived the following fundamental result
in quantum physics:
The classical notion of the trajectory of a particle, which has a precise
position and a precise velocity at the same time, is not meaningful anymore
in quantum mechanics.
Explicitly, for the operators Q, P : S(R) →L2(R) called position operator Q and
momentum operator P, we have the Heisenberg commutation relation
(QP −PQ)ϕ = iℏϕ
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
(7.53)
Let ϕ ∈S(R) be a normalized state in the Hilbert space L2(R). We claim that
ΔxΔp ≥ℏ
2 .
(7.54)
This means that it is impossible to measure precisely the position and the mo-
mentum of the quantum particle in the state ϕ at the same time. The uncertainty
inequality (7.54) follows from (7.53) as a special case of Theorem 10.4 on page 524
of Vol. I.

7.4.7 Unstable Quantum States and the Energy-Time
Uncertainty Relation
In particle accelerators, many particles are unstable; such so-called reso-
nances only live a very short time.
Folklore
We are going to show that wave packets are unstable in quantum mechanics. There
exists a fundamental inequality between the life-time of the wave packet and its
mean energy ﬂuctuation which is called the energy–time uncertainty relation.
Wave packets and the Fourier transformation. Let E(p) := p2/2m de-
note the energy of a freely moving classical particle on the real line with mass m,
momentum p ∈R, and velocity v = p/m. For each nonzero complex number C, the
standing plane wave
ψ(x, t) := Ce−itE(p)/ℏeipx/ℏ,
x, t ∈R
describes a stream of particles with mass m, momentum p, velocity v = p/m, energy
E(p), and particle density ϱ = |C|2. Since |ψ(x, t)|2 = |C|2, the wave function ψ
does not live in the Hilbert space L2(R). However, using the superposition
ψ(x, t) =
1
√
2πℏ
Z ∞
−∞
A(p)e−itE(p)/ℏeipx/ℏdp
(7.55)
of standing plane waves with diﬀerent momenta, we can construct so-called wave
packets which live in the Hilbert space L2(R) if the amplitude function A = A(p)
lives in the space S(R). The Fourier transformation yields
A(p)e−iE(p)t/ℏ=

(7.56)
where the real numbers ¯p and Δp > 0 are given. In order to understand the physics
of wave packets, let us introduce the following quantities
Δx0 :=
ℏ
2Δp,
ΔE := (Δp)2
2m ,
Δt :=

2ΔE ,
and ¯v := ¯p/m, ¯x := ¯vt, , ¯E := ¯p2/2m, as well as

The mean values and mean ﬂuctuations of the position operator Q and the momen-
tum operator P in the state ψ at time t are ¯x, Δx, ¯p, Δp, respectively.

7.4 Schr¨odinger’s Quantum Mechanics
477
This follows by using classical formulas for Gauss–Fresnel integrals.
2
This result allows the following physical interpretation. The wave function ψ
lives in the Hilbert space L2(R). It represents a particle with mean momentum ¯p,
mean energy ¯E, mean ﬂuctuation of momentum Δp and mean ﬂuctuation of energy
ΔE. Moreover, the mean position ¯x = ¯vt of the particle moves with the velocity
¯v = ¯p/m called the group velocity of the wave packet. It is quite remarkable that
The wave packet is unstable.
In fact, by (7.57), the mean ﬂuctuations Δx of the position of the particle go to
inﬁnity as time goes to inﬁnity, that is, the particle is spread over the whole real
line after a suﬃciently long time. The lifetime of the particle can be measured by
the quantity Δt. According to (7.57), the position ﬂuctuations Δx increase in the
time interval [0, Δt] by the factor
√
2.
The energy-time uncertainty principle. The equation
ΔpΔx = ℏ
2
for the ground state of a harmonic oscillator represents a special case of the general
momentum-position uncertainty inequality ΔpΔx ≥ℏ
2 . It shows that the Heisen-
berg uncertainty inequality cannot be improved. Furthermore, we have the equation
ΔEΔt = ℏ
2
for the Gaussian wave packet. In general, physicists assume that for all unstable
particles, there holds the energy-time uncertainty inequality
ΔEΔt ≥ℏ
2
(7.58)
for the lifetime Δt of the particle and its energy ﬂuctuation ΔE. In high-energy
particle accelerators, physicists observe frequently so-called resonances. These are
unstable particles of mass Δm which decay after the time Δt. By Einstein’s mass-
energy equivalence, we have
ΔE = c2Δm
where c denotes the speed of light in a vacuum. From (7.58) we get the following
fundamental inequality in particle physics
ΔmΔt ≥
ℏ
2c2
between the mass Δm of a resonance and its lifetime Δt.
The energy-time uncertainty principle is motivated by Einstein’s theory of spe-
cial relativity. Let us explain this. In special relativity, an event corresponds to a
four-vector
(x, y, z, ct)
in Minkowski space. This is a combination of space and time. Similarly, there exists
a combination of momentum (px, py, pz) and energy E described by the four-vector
(px, py, pz, E
c ).
The momentum-energy uncertainty principle yields

478
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
ΔpxΔx ≥ℏ
2 ,
ΔpyΔy ≥ℏ
2 ,
ΔpzΔz ≥ℏ
2 .
Postulating complete relativistic symmetry in nature, we can replace px and x by
E/c and ct, respectively. This yields (7.58).
The energy-time uncertainty inequality represents one of the basic principles
of modern physics. Physicists call the ground state of our world the vacuum. This
ground state cannot be observed in a straight-forward way. However, there exist
quantum ﬂuctuations of the vacuum which can be observed as physical eﬀects; for
example, this concerns the ﬁne structure of the energy spectrum of the hydrogen
atom, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, and the vaporization of
black holes in the universe. To understand this, one needs the methods of quantum
ﬁeld theory.
7.4.8 Schr¨odinger’s Coherent States
There arises the following question: Is it possible to construct a stable time-
dependent wave packet by the superposition of time-dependent eigenstates of the
quantum harmonic oscillator? The positive answer was found by Schr¨odinger in
1926.39 For each complex number α = |α|eiδ, we deﬁne the coherent state

where the pair ϕn, En = ℏω(n + 1

the quantum harmonic oscillator. For each α ∈C, the function ψα possesses the
following properties:
(i) Schr¨odinger equation: ψα is a solution of the time-dependent Schr¨odinger equa-
tion for the harmonic oscillator.
(ii) Normalization: x →ψα(x, t) is a normalized state in the Hilbert space L2(R)
for each time t ∈R.
(iii) Mean position: ¯x(t) = ⟨ψα(t)|Qψα⟩=
√
2 x0|α| cos(ωt −δ) for all times t ∈R.
Recall that x0 :=

(iv) Probability density: For all x, t ∈R,

This is a Gaussian distribution where the mean value ¯x(t) oscillates with the

(v) Eigenvectors of the annihilation operator: aψα(x, 0) = αψα(x, 0) for all x ∈R.

coherent light waves. As a standard textbook on coherent states and laser optics,
we recommend the monograph by L. Mandel and E. Wolf, Optical Coherence and
Quantum Optics, Cambridge University Press, 1995.
7.5 Feynman’s Quantum Mechanics
It is a curious historical fact that quantum mechanics began with two
quite diﬀerent mathematical formulations: the diﬀerential equation of
Schr¨odinger, and the matrix algebra of Heisenberg. The two, apparently
dissimilar approaches, were proved to be mathematically equivalent. These
two points of view were destined to complement one another and to be ul-
timately synthesized in Dirac’s transformation theory.
This paper will describe what is essentially a third formulation of non-
relativistic quantum theory. This formulation was suggested by some of
Dirac’s remarks concerning the relation of classical action to quantum
mechanics. A probability amplitude is associated with an entire motion of
a particle as a function of time, rather than simply with a position of the
particle at a particular time.
The formulation is mathematically equivalent to the more usual formula-
tions. There are, therefore, no fundamentally new results. However, there
is a pleasure in recognizing old things from a new point of view. Also, there
are problems for which the new point of view oﬀers a distinct advantage.40
Richard Feynman, 1948
The calculations that I did for Hans Bethe, using the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion, took me several months of work and several hundred sheets of paper.
Dick Feynman (1918–1988) could get the same answer, calculating on a
blackboard, in half an hour.41

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
√z :=
p
|z| eiϕ/2.
(7.59)
For example,
√
i = eiπ/4. If we use the principal values, then the function
z →√z
(7.60)
is holomorphic on the set C\] −∞, 0] (the complex plane cut along the negative
real axis). Thus, analytic continuation of the function f(x) := √x, x > 0 yields the
function (7.60). This fact will be frequently used in what follows. The idea is to
pass from time t to imaginary time it and to use analytic continuation in order to
translate well-known results from diﬀusion processes to quantum processes. This is
called the Euclidean strategy in quantum physics. The following golden rule holds:
Apply analytic continuation only to such quantities that you can measure
in physical experiments.
Analytic continuation of functions depending on energy plays a crucial role in study-
ing the following subjects:
• scattering processes,
• the energies energies of bound states, and
• the energies of unstable particles having ﬁnite lifetime (called resonances).
For this, we refer to Sect. 8.3.5 on page 713. In terms of the double-sheeted Riemann
surface R of the multi-valued square-root function (used by physicists in quantum
physics), the principal value of √z in the open upper (resp. lower) half-plane cor-
responds to the ﬁrst (resp. second sheet) of R (see Fig. 8.6 on page 714).
Similarly, as for the square root, the value ln z := ln |z|+iϕ is called the principal
value of the logarithm, where the argument ϕ of the square root is uniquely deﬁned
as above by the condition −π < ϕ < π. The function z →ln z is holomorphic on
C\] −∞, 0].
7.5.1 Main Ideas
The basic idea of Feynman’s approach to quantum mechanics is
• to describe the time-evolution of a quantum system by an integral formula, which
is equivalent to the Schr¨odinger diﬀerential equation,
• and to represent the kernel K(x, t; y, t0) of the integral formula by a path integral.
From the physical point of view, Feynman emphasized that
The description of quantum particles becomes easier if we use probability
amplitudes as basic quantities, but not transition probabilities.
The reason is that, in contrast to transition probabilities, probability amplitudes
satisfy a simple composition rule (also called product rule) which is at the heart
of Feynman’s approach to quantum theory. In terms of ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
spaces, the following hold:
• Feynman’s probability amplitudes are precisely the complex-valued Fourier co-
eﬃcients c1, c2, . . . , cn of a state vector.
• Feynman’s composition rule for probability amplitudes coincides with the Par-
seval equation (7.81) for Fourier coeﬃcients in mathematics.42
42 Parseval des Ch´enes (1755–1836), Fourier (1768–1830), Dirac (1902–1984), von
Neumann (1903–1957), Laurent Schwartz (1915–2004), Feynman (1918–1988),
Gelfand (born 1913).

7.5 Feynman’s Quantum Mechanics
481
• The transition probabilities correspond to the quadratic quantities
|c1|2, |c2|2, . . . , |cn|2,
which do not linearly depend on the corresponding state vector, in contrast to
the Fourier coeﬃcients c1, c2, . . . , cn.
In inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, one has to replace Fourier series by Fourier
integrals and their generalizations (e.g., Fourier–Stieltjes integrals). In physics, this
corresponds to the formal Dirac calculus. In terms of mathematics, one has to
use von Neumann’s spectral theory for self-adjoint operators and the more general
Gelfand theory of generalized eigenfunctions based on Laurent Schwartz’s language
of distributions (generalized functions).
Feynman’s integral formula. According to Schr¨odinger, the motion of a
quantum particle of mass m > 0 on the real line is described by the diﬀerential
equation
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t) + U(x)ψ(x, t),
ψ(x, t0) = ψ0(x),
(7.61)
for all positions x ∈R and all times t > t0. Feynman used the fact that the solution
of this initial-value problem can be represented by the integral formula
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
K(x, t; x0, t0)ψ0(x0)dx0,
x ∈R, t > t0.
(7.62)
The main task is to compute the kernel K, which is called the (retarded) Feynman
propagator kernel. There exist two diﬀerent methods.43
(i) The Fourier method: Following Fourier’s approach to the heat conduction equa-
tion, one can use eigenfunction expansions (e.g., Fourier series or Fourier inte-
grals) in order to get the kernel K. For the heat kernel, we will discuss this in
(7.77) below.44
(ii) The path integral method: In his 1942 Princeton dissertation, Feynman (1918–
1988) invented the path integral representation
K(x, t; x0, t0) =
Z
C{t0,t}
eiS[q]/ℏDq.
(7.63)
Here, we sum over all possible classical paths q : [t0, t] →R on the real line
with ﬁxed endpoints: q(t0) = x0 and q(t) = x. The symbol S[q] denotes the
classical action of the path q = q(τ), t0 < τ < t.
According to Feynman, the passage from classical mechanics to quan-
tum mechanics corresponds to a statistics over all possible classical
paths where the statistical weight eiS[q]/ℏdepends on the classical ac-
tion.
43 In terms of ﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, the two methods are thoroughly
investigated in Volume I. For the Fourier method (resp. the Feynman path inte-
gral method), see formula (7.82) on page 421 of Vol. I (resp. formula (7.78) on
page 417 of Vol. I).

enough, Fourier (1768–1830) was obsessed with heat, keeping his rooms ex-
tremely hot.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
This is a highly intuitive interpretation of the quantization of classical pro-
cesses. Let us discuss the intuitive background.
Causality and the product rule for the Feynman propagator. The Feyn-
man propagator kernel satisﬁes the following product rule:
K(x, t; x0, t0) =
Z
R
K(x, t; y, τ)K(y, τ; x0, t0) dy,
t > τ > t0.
(7.64)
It follows from (7.62) that this relation reﬂects causality. To explain this, choose
t0 < τ < t. We start with a wave function ψ = ψ(x0, t0) at the initial time t0. For
the wave function at the intermediate time τ and at the ﬁnal time t, we get
ψ(y, τ) =
Z
R
K(y, τ; x0, t0)ψ(x0, t0)dx0
(7.65)
and
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
K(x, t; y, τ)ψ(y, τ)dy,
(7.66)
respectively. By causality, we expect that ψ(x, t) at the ﬁnal time t can also be
generated by the wave function at the initial time t0, that is,
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
K(x, t; x0, t0)ψ(x0, t0)dx0.
(7.67)
Now the product formula (7.64) tells us that indeed the composition of the two
formulas (7.65) and (7.66) yields (7.67).
The inﬁnitesimal Feynman propagator kernel. In order to obtain his
path integral, Feynman used the causality condition (7.64) and the following magic
approximation formula:
K(x + Δx, t + Δt; x, t) = eiΔS/ℏ· Kﬂuct(t + Δt; t).
(7.68)
This is an approximation formula for small position diﬀerences Δx and small time
diﬀerences Δt. Explicitly, we use
• the classical action diﬀerence
ΔS :=
„m

“Δx

with the discrete velocity Δx
Δt and the discrete energy ΔE := ΔS/Δt, and
• the inﬁnitesimal quantum ﬂuctuation term
Kﬂuct(t + Δt; t) :=

Here, ΔS is an approximation of the classical action

is, q(t) = x and q(t + Δt) = x + Δx. Here, the symbol m denotes the mass of the
particle on the real line. The magic formula (7.68) tells us that

7.5 Feynman’s Quantum Mechanics
483
The passage from classical mechanics to quantum mechanics is obtained
by adding quantum ﬂuctuations.
The magic formula (7.68) combines the inﬁnitesimal strategy due to Newton (1643–
1727) and Leibniz (1646–1616) with the principle of least action due to Leibniz,
Maupertuis (1698–1759) and Euler (1707–1783). Introducing the (complex) char-
acteristic length45

Kﬂuct(t + Δt; t) =

,
the magic Feynman formula (7.68) reads as
K(x + Δx, t + Δt; x, t) = eiΔS/ℏ
l
.
This reﬂects the fact that the Feynman propagator kernel K has the physical di-
mension (length)−1 for the motion of a quantum particle on the real line.
The global Feynman propagator kernel. Combining the causality princi-
ple (7.64) with the magic formula (7.68) for the inﬁnitesimal propagator kernel,
Feynman arrived at the following global kernel formula:

Here, we add the boundary conditions: q0 := x0 and qN := x. The crucial Feynman
formula (7.69) tells us that the global Feynman propagator kernel K(x, t; x0, t0)
is obtained by summing over all possible time-ordered products of inﬁnitesimal
Feynman propagator kernels. This is a special case of the following general principle
in natural philosophy:
In nature, interactions are obtained by the superposition of all possible
inﬁnitesimal interactions taking causality into account.

Physicists use the following two methods for computing path integrals:
(i) the limit formula (7.70) and
(ii) inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals.
Method (i) corresponds to an approximation of continuous paths by polygons.
Method (ii) generalizes the ﬁnite-dimensional formula

to inﬁnite dimensions. In this context, one has to deﬁne the determinant det A of
an inﬁnite-dimensional operator A by generalizing the ﬁnite-dimensional formula
det A =
N
Y
n=1
λn
for the eigenvalues λ1, . . . , λN of the operator A. Here, we will use the analytic con-
tinuation of the Riemann zeta function and its generalization to elliptic diﬀerential
operators on Riemannian manifolds (see Sect. 7.9). Summarizing, we will get the
following key formula:
K(x, t; x0, t0) =
Z
C{t0,t}
eiS[q]/ℏDq = N
Z
C{t0,t}
eiS[q]/ℏDGq
(7.71)
which is basic for modern physics. This formuula tells us that the Feynman path
integral diﬀers from the normalized inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integral by a
normalization factor N. Fortunately enough, the explicit knowledge of the normal-
ization factor N is not necessary in many applications to quantum ﬁeld theory. In
terms of mathematics, formula (7.71) connects diﬀerent subjects of mathematics
with each other: spectral theory of elliptic diﬀerential operators on Riemannian
manifolds, harmonic analysis, analytic number theory, distributions and pseudo-
diﬀerential operators, Fourier integral operators, random walks and stochastic pro-
cesses (Brownian motion), topological quantum ﬁeld theory (topological invariants
of knots, manifolds and algebraic varieties). This concerns the following mathemati-
cal branches: analysis, diﬀerential geometry, algebraic topology, algebraic geometry,
and theory of probability.
The innocently looking formula (7.71) emphasizes the unity of mathemat-
ics.
The WKB (Wentzel, Kramers, Brioullin) method. The passage from
Maxwell’s wave optics to geometric optics corresponds to the limit λ →0 (i.e.,
the wavelength λ goes to zero). Similarly, the passage from quantum mechanics to
classical mechanics corresponds to the limit
ℏ→0
called the classical limit. More precisely, this means that quantum eﬀects occur
if the quotient ℏ/Sdaily is suﬃciently small. Here, Sdaily is the action of processes
in daily life. Explicitly, ℏ∼10−34Js and Sdaily ∼1Js. Shortly after Schr¨odinger’s
publication of his wave mechanics in 1926, Wentzel, Kramers, and Brioullin inde-
pendently investigated the limit ℏ→0 parallel to geometric optics.46 In terms of
the Feynman path integral, the reﬁned WKB method yields the following elegant
key formula
K(x, t; x0, t0) = eiS[qclass]/ℏKﬂuct(x, t; x0, t0)

where S[qclass] is the action along the classical path with the boundary condition
qclass(t0) = x0 and qclass(t) = x. The factor Kﬂuct describes quantum ﬂuctuations
(see Sect. 7.10 on page 580).
Diﬀusion processes and the Euclidean strategy in quantum mechan-
ics. The diﬀusion equation
∂ψ(x, t)
∂t
= κψxx −V (x),
ψ(x, t0) = ψ0(x)
(7.73)
for all x ∈R and all t > t0 describes the diﬀusion of particles on the real line, where
ψ(x, t) denotes the particle density at the position x at time t, and κ > 0 is the
diﬀusion constant. Using the replacement
t ⇒it,
(7.74)
and setting κ := ℏ/2m, U(x) := −ℏV (x), the diﬀusion equation (7.73) passes over
to the Schr¨odinger equation (7.61).47 We expect that, by the replacement (7.74),
each result on the classical diﬀusion equation (7.73) generates a result in quantum
mechanics. This is called the Euclidean strategy. For example, let V (x) ≡0. We
will show below that the classical diﬀusion kernel
P(x, t; x0, t0) =
r
m
2πℏ(t −t0) · e−m(x−x0)2/2ℏ(t−t0)
(7.75)
passes over to the Feynman propagator kernel K(x, t; x0, t0) := P(x, it; x0, it0). Ex-
plicitly,
K(x, t; x0, t0) =
r
m
2πiℏ(t −t0) · eim(x−x0)2/2ℏ(t−t0)
(7.76)
for all positions x, x0 ∈R and all times t > t0.
Brownian motion. In 1905 Einstein studied the Brownian motion of tiny par-
ticles suspended in a liquid. This was the beginning of the theory of stochastic
processes, which was developed as a mathematical theory by Wiener and Kol-
mogorov in the early 1920s and in the early 1930s, respectively.48 Comparing the
Schr¨odinger equation (7.61) with the diﬀusion equation (7.73), we arrive at the
following intuitive interpretation of quantum mechanics emphasized by Feynman:
The motion of a quantum particle on the real line can be regarded as Brow-
nian motion (i.e., a random walk) in imaginary time.
This formal analogy motivated Mark Kac in 1949 to prove the famous Feynman–
Kac formula49 which represents the diﬀusion kernel (7.75) as a path integral, in
rigorous mathematical terms see Sect. 7.11.5 on page 588.

taken from the comprehensive handbook on Feynman path integrals in quantum
mechanics written by Christian Grosche and Frank Steiner:50

then the equation (7.73) describes the heat conduction on the real line.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Feynman was working as a research assistant at Princeton during 1940–41.
In the course of his graduate studies he discovered with Wheeler an action
principle using half advanced and half retarded potentials.51 The problem
was the inﬁnite self-energy of the electron, and it turned out that the new
“action principle” could deal successfully with the inﬁnity arising in the
application of classical electrodynamics.
The problem then became one of applying this action principle to quantum
mechanics in such a way that classical mechanics could arise naturally as
a special case of quantum mechanics when the Planck quantum of action
h was allowed to go to zero.
Feynman searched for any ideas which might have been previously worked
out in connecting quantum-mechanical behavior with such classical ideas
as the Lagrangian and Hamilton’s action integral . . . At a Princeton beer
party Richard Feynman learned from Herbert Jehle, a former student of
Schr¨odinger in Berlin, who had newly arrived from Europe, of Dirac’s
paper.52 Dirac showed that
⟨q(t)|q(t0)⟩
corresponds to
e
i
ℏ
R t
t0 Ldt,
where L is the Lagrangian. The natural question that then arose was what
Dirac had meant by the phrase “corresponds to.” Feynman found that
Dirac’s statement actually means “proportionally to”, that is,
K(x + Δx, t + Δt; x, t) = const(Δt) · eiΔS/ℏ.
Based on this result and the causality composition law (7.64) in the limit
N →∞, Feynman interpreted the multiple-integral construction (7.70)
as an “integral over all paths” and wrote this down in his Ph. D. thesis
presented to the Faculty of Princeton University on May 4, 1942.53 During
the war Feynman worked at Los Alamos (New Mexico), and after the war
his primary direction of work was towards quantum electrodynamics. So it
happened that a complete theory of the path integral approach to quantum
mechanics was worked out only in 1947. Feynman submitted his paper to
the Physical Review, but the editors rejected it! Thus he rewrote it and
sent it to Reviews of Modern Physics, where it ﬁnally appeared in spring
1948 under the title “Space-time approach to non-relativistic quantum
mechanics.”54 Feynman’s paper is one of the most beautiful and most
inﬂuential papers in physics written during the last ﬁfty years.55

55 Feynman’s approach to quantum mechanics has a forerunner. In 1924 Wentzel
published a paper where one can ﬁnd the basic formulae and their interpretation
as they were adopted twenty years later by Feynman. In fact, Wentzel’s paper was
published before the fundamental papers by Heisenberg (1925) and Schr¨odinger
(1926). See G. Wentzel, Zur Quantenoptik (On quantum optics), Z. Physik 22
(1924), 193–199. This is discussed in: S. Antoci and D. Liebscher, The third
way to quantum mechanics is the forgotten ﬁrst, Annales de Fondation Louis de
Broglie 21 (1996), 349–368 (see also S. Antoci and D. Liebscher, Wentzel’s path
integrals, Int. J. Math. Phys. 37 (1998), 531–535).

7.5.2 The Diﬀusion Kernel and the Euclidean Strategy in
Quantum Physics
Formal motivation of the diﬀusion kernel. In order to discuss the basic idea
of the Euclidean strategy in quantum mechanics, let us start with considering the
classical diﬀusion equation
ψt(x, t) = κψxx(x, t),
x ∈R, t > t0, ψ(x, t0) = ψ(x)
(7.77)
where κ := ℏ/2m. We want to obtain the kernel P from (7.75), by using the Fourier
method in a formal way. We start with the following two conditions
(C1) Pt(x, t) = κPxx(x, t), x ∈R, t > 0, and
(C2) limt→+0 P(x, t) = δ(x), x ∈R.
Taking the existence of P for granted, set P(x, t; x0, t0) := P(x −x0; t −t0). We
want to show that the function
ψ(x, t) :=
Z
R
P(x, t; x0, t0)ψ0(x0)dx0,
x ∈R, t > t0
is a solution of (7.77). In fact, it follows from (C1) that
ψt(x, t) −κψxx(x, t) =
Z
R
(Pt −Pxx)ψ0(x0)dx0 = 0,
x ∈R, t > 0.
By (C2), limt→t0+0 ψ(x, t) =
R
R limt→t0+0 P(x, t; x0, t0)ψ0(x0)dx0, and hence
lim
t→t0+0 ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
δ(x −x0)ψ0(x0)dx0 = ψ0(x).
It remains to determine the function P. Let p →ˆP(p, t) be the Fourier transform
of x →P(x, t). By (C1) and (C2),
ˆPt(p, t) = −κp2 ˆP(p, t),
t > 0,
ˆP(p, 0) =
1
√
2π
.
Hence ˆP(p, t) =
1
√
2π e−κp2t. By Fourier transform,
P(x, t) = 1
2π
Z
R
eipx e−κp2t dp,
x ∈R, t > 0.
Hence P(x, t) =
1
√
4πκt e−x2/4κt (see the Gaussian integral (7.182) on page 560).
This ﬁnishes the classical motivation for the diﬀusion kernel (7.75).
The classical existence theorem for the diﬀusion equation. The proof
of the following standard result in the theory of partial diﬀerential equations can
be found in H. Triebel, Higher Analysis, Sect. 42, Barth, Leipzig, 1989.
Theorem 7.15 We are given the initial function ψ0 ∈D(R). Choose the kernel P
as in (7.75). Then the function
ψ(x, t) :=
Z
R
P(x, t; x0, t0)ψ0(x0) dx0,
x ∈R, t > t0
(7.78)
is a classical solution of the diﬀusion equation (7.77). In addition, we have the
initial condition limt→t0+0 ψ(x, t) = ψ0(x) for all x ∈R.

488
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The classical existence theorem for the free quantum particle on the
real line. Consider the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t), x ∈R, t > t0, ψ(x, t0) = ψ0(x)
(7.79)
for the motion of a free quantum particle of mass m on the real line. Let D denote
the set of all Gaussian functions e−β(x−α)2, x ∈R with real parameter α and positive
parameter β. The complex linear hull, span D, is a dense subset of the Hilbert space
L2(R).
Theorem 7.16 We are given the initial function ψ0 ∈span D. Choose the kernel
K as in (7.75). Then the function
ψ(x, t) :=
Z
R
K(x, t; x0, t0)ψ0(x0) dx0,
x ∈R, t > t0
(7.80)
is a classical solution of the Schr¨odinger equation (7.79). In addition, we have the
initial condition limt→t0+0 ψ(x, t) = ψ0(x), in the sense of the convergence on the
Hilbert space L2(R).
The proof can be found in Zeidler (1995a), Sect. 5.22.2 (see the references on page
1049).
Formal perspectives. In the next sections, we will study the following topics
in a formal manner:
• Propagator theory via the formal Dirac calculus (Sect. 7.5.3).
• Formal motivation of the deﬁnition of the Feynman path integral (Sect. 7.7.6).
Rigorous perspectives. Furthermore, we will rigorously investigate the fol-
lowing mathematical topics:
• Von Neumann’s operator calculus and the functional-analytic approach to both
the Feynman propagator and the Euclidean Feynman propagator (Sect. 7.6.3).
• Functional-analytic theory of the motion of a free quantum particle on the real
line (Sect. 7.6.4).
• Functional-analytic theory of the motion of a harmonic oscillator on the real line
and the Maslov index (Sect. 7.6.7).
• The Euclidean Feynman propagator and von Neumann’s density matrix in quan-
tum statistics (Sect. 7.6.8).
• Computation of the Feynman path integral for both the free quantum particle
and the quantized harmonic oscillator (Sects. 7.7.3 and 7.7.4).
• The relation between inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals and the Feynman
propagator kernel including applications to the free quantum particle and the
quantized harmonic oscillator (Sect. 7.9).
• The semi-classical WKB method (Sect. 7.10).
• Brownian motion, the Wiener integral, and the Feynman–Kac formula for diﬀu-
sion processes (Sect. 7.11).
7.5.3 Probability Amplitudes and the Formal Propagator Theory
Feynman’s approach to quantum theory can be understood best by using
Dirac’s formal calculus; this can be generalized straightforward to quantum
ﬁeld theory.

The Parseval equation. Let ϕ1, . . . , ϕN be an orthonormal basis of the complex
N-dimensional Hilbert space Y . This means that the orthonormality condition
⟨ϕk|ϕl⟩= δkl,
k, l = 1, . . . , N
is satisﬁed. The basis property tells us that, for all ϕ, ψ ∈Y, we have
(F) the Fourier expansion |ψ⟩= PN
k=1 |ϕk⟩⟨ϕk|ψ⟩,
(C) the completeness relation I = PN
k=1 |ϕk⟩⟨ϕk|, and56
(P) the Parseval equation
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=

k=1
⟨ψ|ϕk⟩⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩.
(7.81)
These classical properties of Fourier expansions are discussed in Sect. 7.10 of Vol.
I. The complex numbers c1 := ⟨ψ|ϕ1⟩, . . . , cN := ⟨ψ|ϕN⟩are called the Fourier
coeﬃcients. Suppose that ||ψ|| = 1. By the Parseval equation,
||ψ||2 =
N
X
k=1
|ck|2 = 1.
If ψ is the state of a quantum particle, then |ck|2 is the probability for observing the
particle in the state ϕk; the Fourier coeﬃcients c1, . . . , cN are called the probability
amplitudes of the particle state ψ.
The Schr¨odinger equation. Consider again the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏψt = −ℏ2
2m
∂2ψ
∂x2 + Uψ
(7.82)
for the motion of a quantum particle on the real line. Here, m > 0 is the mass of the
particle. We assume that the smooth potential function U : R →R has compact
support, that is, U ∈D(R). In terms of physics, the potential U describes the force
acting on the quantum particle. If U ≡0, then the quantum particle is called free.
Set
H0ϕ := −ℏ2
2m
∂2ϕ
∂x2 + Uϕ
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Then the operator H0 : D(R) →L2(R) is essentially self-adjoint on the Hilbert
space L2(R). Let H : W 2
2 (R) →L2(R) be the self-adjoint extension of H0. Then
the Schr¨odinger equation reads as
iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t),
t > t0,
ψ(t0) = ψ0
with the unique solution ψ(t) = e−iH(t−t0)/ℏψ0 (see Theorem 7.25 on page 507).
The formal Dirac calculus. It is our goal to study the Schr¨odinger equation
(7.82) by means of the formal Dirac calculus on the real line.57 In particular, we
will use
• the orthonormality condition ⟨x|x0⟩= δ(x −x0) for all x, x0 ∈R, and
56 In mathematics, one also writes ψ = PN
k=1⟨ϕk|ψ⟩ϕk and I = PN
k=1 ϕk ⊗ϕk.
57 This formal calculus is thoroughly discussed in Sect. 11.2.5 of Vol. I. The rigorous
justiﬁcation of the Dirac calculus can be found in Sect. 12.2 of Vol. I.

• the completeness relation
I =

R
|x⟩⟨x| dx,
(7.83)
where I denotes the unit operator. Using the trivial identity ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|Iϕ⟩and
the completeness relation (7.83), we formally get the Parseval equation
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=
Z
R
⟨ψ|x⟩⟨x|ϕ⟩dx.
(7.84)
This elegant formal argument is called Dirac’s substitution trick.58
Formal operator kernel. The operator equation ϕ = Aψ is equivalent to the
integral relation
⟨x|ϕ⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|A|x0⟩⟨x0|ψ⟩dx0,
x ∈R,
by using the completeness relation. Setting A(x, x0) := ⟨x|A|x0⟩for all positions
x, x0 ∈R, we get
ϕ(x) =
Z
R
A(x, x0)ψ(x0)dx0,
x, x0 ∈R.
The function (x, x0) →A(x, x0) is called the kernel of the operator A. In rigorous
terms, this is not always a classical function. For example, the identical operator
A = I has the kernel
A(x, x0) = ⟨x|x0⟩= δ(x −x0).
If we choose the Hamiltonian H, then the stationary Schr¨odinger equation
−ℏ2
2mψ′′(x) + U(x)ψ(x) = ϕ(x),
x ∈R
(7.85)
means that ϕ = Hψ. Formally, this is equivalent to the integral relation
⟨x|ϕ⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|H|x0⟩⟨x0|ψ⟩dx0,
x ∈R,
(7.86)
by using the completeness relation (7.83). Now we want to study the kernels K
and G to the Feynman propagator e−i(t−t0)H/ℏand the negative resolvent operator
(H −EI)−1, respectively. Here, K and G is called the Feynman propagator kernel
and the energetic Green’s function, respectively.
In terms of modern mathematics, the Dirac calculus is a forerunner of
the theory of pseudo-diﬀerential operators, where diﬀerential operators and
integral operators are treated on equal footing.
58 Writing ⟨x|ϕ⟩= ϕ(x) and ⟨ψ|x⟩= ⟨x|ψ⟩† = ψ(x)†, equation (7.84) reads as
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=
Z
R
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx.
This is the inner product on the Hilbert space L2(R).

7.5 Feynman’s Quantum Mechanics

We refer to the treatise by L. H¨ormander, The Analysis of Linear Partial Diﬀerential
Operators, Vols. 1–4, Springer, New York, 1983.
The key formulas. The Feynman approach to quantum physics is based on
the following formal arguments.
(i) The Feynman propagator kernel K: For all positions x, x0 ∈R and all times
t > t0, we deﬁne the Feynman propagator kernel
K(x, t; x0, t0) := ⟨x|e−iH(t−t0)/ℏ|x0⟩.
(7.87)
• Integral representation for the dynamics of the quantum particle: For the
solution ψ(t) = e−iH(t−t0)/ℏψ0 of the Schr¨odinger equation (7.82), we have
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
K(x, t; x0, t0)ψ(x0, t0)dx0,
x ∈R, t > t0.
(7.88)
• Schr¨odinger equation for the Feynman propagator kernel: For all positions
x, x0 ∈R and all times t > t0,
iℏKt(x, t; x0, t0) = −ℏ2
2mKxx(x, t; x0, t0) + U(x)K(x, t; x0, t0).
• Singularity at the initial time t0 :
lim
t→t0+0 K(x, t; x0, t0) = δ(x −x0),
x, x0 ∈R.
(7.89)
• Causality relation: For all positions x, x0 ∈R and all times t > τ > t0,
K(x, t; x0, t0) =
Z
R
K(x, t; y, τ)K(y, τ; x0, t0) dy.
(7.90)
This is the product rule for the Feynman propagator kernel.
Formal proof. By the completeness relation
R
R |x0⟩⟨x0| dx0 = I,
⟨x|ψ⟩= ⟨x|e−iH(t−t0)/ℏ|ψ0⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|e−iH(t−t0)/ℏ|x0⟩⟨x0|ψ0⟩dx0.
This is (7.88). The diﬀerential equation for K follows from the fact that the
two expressions
iℏψt(x, t) =
Z
R
iℏKt(x, t; x0, t0)ψ0(x0) dx0,
Hψ(x, t) =
Z
R
HK(x, t; x0, t0)ψ0(x0) dx0
are equal to each other for all initial functions ψ0. Hence iℏKt = HK. Fur-
thermore,
lim
t→t0+0⟨x|e−iH(t−t0)|x0⟩= ⟨x|x0⟩= δ(x −x0).
From the group property eu+v = euev, u, v ∈C of the exponential function,
we get

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
e−iH(t−t0)/ℏ= e−iH(t−τ)ℏe−iH(τ−t0)/ℏ,
t0 < τ < t.
This implies
⟨x|e−iH(t−t0)/ℏ|x0⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|e−iH(t−τ)/ℏ|y⟩⟨y|e−iH(τ−t0)/ℏ|x0⟩dy, (7.91)
which is the causality relation (7.90).

(ii) The resolvent kernel R: Let ϱ(H) be the resolvent set of the Hamiltonian H
on the Hilbert space L2(R). By deﬁnition, the complex number E is contained
in ϱ(H) iﬀthe inverse operator
(EI −H)−1 : L2(R) →L2(R)
exists, and it is continuous. This operator is called the resolvent59 of the Hamil-
tonian H at the point E. We brieﬂy write RE := (EI −H)−1. The complement
σ(E) := C \ ϱ(H) is called the spectrum of H.
The spectrum σ(H) is a closed subset of the real line; the complemen-
tary resolvent set ϱ(H) is an open subset of the complex plane.
The points E in the spectrum σ(H) are the energy values of the quantum
particle described by the Hamiltonian H. For all positions x, x0 ∈R and all
complex numbers E ∈ϱ(H), we deﬁne the resolvent kernel
R(x, x0; E) := ⟨x|(EI −H)−1|x0⟩.
This kernel has the following properties.
• Integral representation of the resolvent: For each given complex number
E ∈ϱ(H), the equation
(EI −H)ψ = χ
has the unique solution ψ = (EI −H)−1χ. This is equivalent to the integral
relation
ψ(x) =
Z
R
R(x, x0; E)χ(x0)dx0,
x ∈R.
(7.92)
This follows from
⟨x|ψ⟩= ⟨x|(EI −H)−1ϕ⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|(EI −H)−1|x0⟩⟨x0|ϕ⟩dx0.
• The resolvent equation: For all E, E′ ∈ϱ(H), we have Hilbert’s resolvent
equation RE −RE′ = (E′ −E)RE′RE. This implies
R(x, x0; E) −R(x, x0; E′) = (E′ −E)
Z
R
R(x, y; E′)R(y, x0; E) dy.
In fact, Hilbert’s resolvent equation implies
⟨x|REx0⟩−⟨x|RE′x0⟩= (E′ −E)
Z
R

59 Physicists frequently use the negative resolvent operator −(EI −H)−1 which is
equal to (H −EI)−1.

(iii) The energetic Green’s function G: For all positions x, x0 ∈R and all complex
numbers E ∈ϱ(H), we deﬁne
G(x, x0; E) := −R(x, x0; E).
For each complex number E ∈ϱ(H), the inhomogeneous stationary equation
(H −EI)ψ = ϕ, that is,
−ℏ2
2mψ′′(x) + (U(x) −E)ψ(x) = ϕ(x),
x ∈R,
has the solution ψ = −(EI −H)−1ϕ. By (7.92),
ψ(x) =
Z
R
G(x, y; E)ϕ(y)dy,
x ∈R.
Choosing ϕ(x) := δ(x −x0), we obtain ψ(x) = G(x, x0; E). This implies that,
for all E ∈ϱ(H), we get
−ℏ2
2mGxx(x, x0; E) + (U(x) −E)G(x, x0; E) = δ(x −x0),
x, x0 ∈R.
Therefore, the function (x, x0) →G(x, x0; E) is called the energetic Green’s
function (or the energetic 2-point function ) with respect to the complex num-
ber E /∈σ(H). Now let us show that the energetic Green’s function has sin-
gularities at the spectral points E ∈σ(H), which correspond to the physical
energy values of the quantum particle described by the Hamiltonian H.
(iv) The energetic Fourier transform: Let {|Ek⟩}k∈N be the complete orthonormal
system of (generalized) eigenstates of the Hamiltonian H with the index set
N. That is, we have
• the (generalized) eigenvalue equation H|Ek⟩= Ek|Ek⟩,
• the completeness relation
R
N |Ek⟩⟨Ek| dμ(k) = I, and
• the orthonormality relation ⟨Ek|El⟩= δμ(k −l) for all k, l ∈N.
Here, μ is a measure on the set N. This measure is called the energy measure
of the Hamiltonian H. The Dirac delta function δμ with respect to the measure
μ has the characteristic property that60
Z
N
δμ(k −k0)f(k) dμ(k) = f(k0).
Thus, the Dirac delta function δμ generalizes the Kronecker symbol. Now let us
assign to each energy state |Ek⟩the so-called energy function χk(x) := ⟨x|Ek⟩
for all x ∈R.
• The Fourier–Stieltjes transform:
ˆψ(k) =
Z
R
χk(x)†ψ(x)dx,
k ∈N.
(7.93)
• The inverse Fourier–Stieltjes transform:
ψ(x) =
Z
N
χk(x) ˆψ(k)dμ(k),
x ∈R.
(7.94)
60 Mnemonically, this follows from
R
N ⟨Ek0|Ek⟩⟨Ek|f⟩dμ(k) = ⟨Ek0|f⟩, by using the
completeness relation.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• The stationary Schr¨odinger equation: For all indices k ∈N,
−ℏ2
2mχ′′
k(x) + U(x)χk(x) = Ekχk(x),
x ∈R.
(7.95)
This tells us that the function χk is an eigenfunction corresponding to the
energy eigenvalue Ek.
• The function ψk(x, t) := e−iEkt/ℏχk(x) satisﬁes the instationary Schr¨odinger
equation:

Formal proof. Ad (7.93). By the completeness relation,
⟨Ek|ψ⟩=

R
⟨Ek|x⟩⟨x|ψ⟩dx.
Ad (7.94). Similarly, ⟨x|ψ⟩=

Ad (7.95). From H|Ek⟩= Ek|Ek⟩, we get
⟨x|Ek⟩= ⟨x|H|Ek⟩=

⟨x|H|x0⟩⟨x0|Ek⟩dx0.
Now use the formal equivalence between (7.85) and (7.86).

(v) The energetic representation of the Feynman propagator kernel: For all posi-
tions x, x0 ∈R and all times t > t0, we have
K(x, t; x0, t0) =

(7.96)
and
G(x, x0; E + iε) =
Z
N
χk(x)χk(x0)†
Ek −E −iε dμ(k).
(7.97)
Formal proof. Ad (7.96). To simplify notation, we set ℏ:= 1 and t0 := 0. By
the completeness relation,
⟨x|e−itH|x0⟩=
Z
N
⟨x|Ek⟩⟨Ek|e−itH|x0⟩dμ(k).
Moreover, e−itH|Ek⟩= e−itEk|Ek⟩. Hence
⟨Ek|e−itH|x0⟩= ⟨x0|eitH|Ek⟩† = e−itEkt⟨x0|Ek⟩† = e−itEktχk(x0)†.
Ad (7.97). Replace e−itH by (H −(E + iε)I)−1.

(vi) The passage from time to energy: For all positions x, x0 ∈R, all times t > t0,
all energies E ∈R, and all energy damping parameters ε > 0, the following
transformation formulas are valid.

which are valid for the following quantities: all energies E, Ek ∈R, all times t, t0 ∈R
with t ̸= t0, and all damping parameters ε > 0. The proof of the latter two formulas
can be found in Problem 7.35.

The preceding formal propagator theory is very convenient from the mnemonical
point of view. Our next goal is to show how this formal approach can be translated
into a rigorous approach. To this end, we will use
• the von Neumann operator calculus in Hilbert spaces,
• tempered distributions, Gelfand triplets, and the theory of generalized eigenfunc-
tions, and
• tempered distributions and the Schwartz kernel theorem.
We will apply this to:
• the free quantum particle (Sect. 7.6.4),
• the harmonic oscillator (Sect. 7.6.7), and
• ideal gases (Sect. 7.6.8).
7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
Rigorous propagator theory is based on von Neumann’s operator calculus
for functions of self-adjoint operators.
Folklore
As a preparation for the rigorous propagator theory to be considered in the next
section, let us summarize von Neumann’s operator calculus. In this section, we con-
sider an arbitrary complex separable Hilbert space X of ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimension.
The inner product on X is denoted by ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩for all ϕ, ψ ∈X. For ﬁxed initial time
t0, the given function ψ : [t0, ∞[→X with values in the Hilbert space X is called
continuously diﬀerentiable iﬀthe following is met:
• For all t > t0, the derivative ˙ψ(t) := limh→0 h−1(ψ(t + h) −ψ(t)) exists (in the
sense of the convergence on the Hilbert space X).
• The function t →ψ(t) is continuous on the closed interval [0, ∞[.
• The function t →˙ψ(t) is continuous on the open interval ]t0, ∞[, and the limit
limt→t0+0 ˙ψ(t) exists.
It is our goal to construct continuously diﬀerentiable solutions of the Schr¨odin-
ger equation iℏ˙ψ = Hψ in the form ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ0. To this end, we need the
construction of the operator e−itH/ℏ.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
7.6.1 The Prototype of the Operator Calculus
The basic idea is to use a complete orthonormal system ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . in the inﬁnite-
dimensional Hilbert space X.61 The two key formulas are given by the series ex-
pansions
Hϕ =
∞
X
k=0
Ek · ⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩ϕk
for all
ϕ ∈D(H)
(7.98)
and
F(H)ϕ =
∞
X
k=0
F(Ek) · ⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩ϕk
for all
ϕ ∈D.
(7.99)
To discuss this, observe ﬁrst that
• the inﬁnite series P∞
k=0 akϕk with complex numbers a0, a1, a2, . . . is convergent
iﬀ
• P∞
k=0 |ak|2 < ∞.
In particular, the completeness of ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . guarantees that
ϕ =
∞
X
k=0
⟨ϕ|ϕk⟩ϕk
for all
ϕ ∈X.
(i) The operator H: We are given the real numbers E0, E1, . . . We deﬁne
Hϕk := Ekϕk,
k = 0, 1, . . .
In a natural way, we want to extend the operator H to a linear subspace D(H)
of X. To this end, we deﬁne
D(H) := {ϕ ∈X :
∞
X
k=0
|Ek|2|⟨ϕ|ϕk⟩|2 < ∞}.
In other words, we have ϕ ∈D(H) iﬀthe inﬁnite series from (7.98) is convergent
in X. Now, for all ϕ ∈D(H), we deﬁne Hϕ by the convergent series (7.98). In
particular, ϕk ∈D(H) for all k.
The operator H : D(H) →X is self-adjoint.
The spectrum σ(H) of H is the closure of the set {E0, E1, . . .}. The resolvent
set ϱ(H) of the operator H is the largest open subset of the complex plane
which does not contain the energy values E0, E1, . . .
(ii) The operator F(H) : D →X: We are given the function F : R →C. Let D
be the set of all elements ϕ of X such that the series (7.99) is convergent.
Explicitly,
D := {ϕ ∈X :
∞
X
k=0
|F(Ek)|2|⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩|2 < ∞}.
Finally, for any ϕ ∈D, deﬁne F(H)ϕ by the convergent series (7.99). The
operator F(H) : D →X is self-adjoint if the function F is real-valued.
61 If the Hilbert space X is ﬁnite-dimensional with dimension N = 1, 2, . . ., then all
of the following formulas remain valid if we replace the symbol P∞
k=0 by PN−1
k=0 .

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach

(iii) The spectral family {Eλ(H)}λ∈R of the self-adjoint operator H. Fix the real
number λ and consider the function
eλ(E) :=
(
1
if
E < λ,
0
if
E ≥λ.
(7.100)
In other words, eλ is the characteristic function of the open interval ] −∞, λ[.
Deﬁne
Eλ(H)ϕ :=
∞
X
k=1
eλ(Ek)⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩ϕk.
This series is convergent for all ϕ ∈X. The operator Eλ(H) : X →X is
the orthogonal projection onto the closed linear subspace spanned by all the
eigenvectors ϕk with Ek ∈] −∞, λ[.
(iv) The propagator e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ: Let t, t0 ∈R. Since |e−i(t−t0)/ℏ| ≤1, the operator
e−i(t−t0)H/ℏϕ :=
∞
X
k=0
e−i(t−t0)Ek/ℏ⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩ϕk
is deﬁned for all ϕ ∈X. In addition, the operator e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ: X →X is
unitary. For given ψ0 ∈D(H), set
ψ(t) := e−i(t−t0)H/ℏψ0
for all
t ∈R.
Then the function ψ : R →X is continuously diﬀerentiable, and it is a solution
of the Schr¨odinger equation.
iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(t0) = ψ0.
Proof. First use formal diﬀerentiation. This yields
iℏ˙ψ(t) =
∞
X
k=0
Eke−i(t−t0)Ek/ℏ⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩ϕk = Hψ(t).
Since we have the convergent majorant series
∞
X
k=0
|Eke−i(t−t0)Ek/ℏ⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩|2 ≤
∞
X
k=0
|Ek|2|⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩|2 < ∞,
the formal diﬀerentiation can be rigorously justiﬁed in the same way as for
classical inﬁnite series (see Sect. 5.8, Zeidler (1995a), quoted on page 1049). 2
(v) The Euclidean propagator e−(t−t0)H/ℏ: Suppose that Ek ≥0 for all k. Fix the
real number t0. Let t ≥t0. Since 0 ≤e−(t−t0)Ek/ℏ≤1, the operator
e−(t−t0)H/ℏϕ :=
∞
X
k=0
e−(t−t0)Ek/ℏ⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩ϕk
is deﬁned for all ϕ ∈X. We have ||e−(t−t0)H/ℏϕ|| ≤||ϕ|| for all ϕ ∈X, that is,
the operator e−(t−t0)H/ℏ: X →X is non-expansive.62 For given ψ0 ∈D(H),
set
62 Note that ||e−(t−t0)H/ℏϕ||2 = P∞
k=0 |e−(t−t0)Ek/ℏ⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩|2. Thus, for all t ≥t0,
||e−(t−t0)H/ℏϕ||2 ≤
∞
X
k=0
|⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩|2 = ||ϕ||2.

498
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
ψ(t) := e−(t−t0)H/ℏψ0
for all
t ≥t0.
Then the function ψ : R →X is continuously diﬀerentiable on [t0, ∞[, and it
is a solution of the Euclidean Schr¨odinger equation
ℏ˙ψ(t) = −Hψ(t),
t ≥t0,
ψ(t0) = ψ0.
(vi) The resolvent (EI −H)−1: Let E be a non-real complex number. The series
REϕ :=
∞
X
k=0
⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩
E −Ek ϕk
is convergent for all ϕ ∈X. This follows from
˛˛˛˛
1
E −Ek
˛˛˛˛
2
=
1
(ℑE)2 + (Ek −ℜE)2 ≤
1
(ℑE)2 .
Hence ||RE||2 ≤const(E)·||ϕ||2. Thus, the operator RE is linear and continuous.
In addition, it can be easily shown that RE = (EI −H)−1.
(vii) The Fourier–Laplace transform of the propagator from time to energy: The
integral
Z ∞
−∞
eiEtf(t)dt
does not exist (in the classical sense) if E is a real number and f(t) ≡1.
However, if we choose both the complex energy E := E + iε (with ε > 0) and
the truncation function f(t) := θ(t −t0), then the integral63
Z ∞
t0
eiEte−εtdt
exists because of the damping factor e−εt. This is the basic idea behind the use
of both truncated propagators and complex energies in quantum physics. In
order to explain this, choose the linear self-adjoint operator H : D(H) →X as
in (i) above. Let t, t0 be arbitrary real time parameters, and let E be a non-real
complex parameter called energy. It is convenient to introduce the following
operators, which we will frequently encounter in this treatise:
• P(t, t0) := e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ(propagator),
• P +(t, t0) := θ(t −t0)P(t, t0) (retarded propagator or Feynman propagator),
• P −(t, t0) := −θ(t0 −t)P(t, t0) (advanced propagator),
• G(E) := (H −EI)−1 (Green’s operator),64
• G+(E) := G(E) if ℑ(E) > 0 (retarded!Green’s operator),
• G−(E) := G(E) if ℑ(E) < 0 (advanced!Green’s operator).
Proposition 7.17 Let t, t0 ∈R and ϕ, χ ∈X. Then:
(i) For all energies E in the open upper half-plane (i.e., ℑ(E) > 0), we have the
Fourier–Laplace transformation
63 Recall that θ(t −t0) = 1 if t ≥t0 and θ(t −t0) = 0 if t < t0 (Heaviside function).
64 Since the operator G(E) depends on the choice of the complex energy E, we also
call it the energetic Green’s operator.

Complete proofs for this prototype of operator calculus including the statements
above can be found in Zeidler (1995a), Chap. 5 (see the references on page 1049).
For the proof of Prop. 7.17 above, we refer to Problem 7.36. The Fourier–Laplace
transform is also brieﬂy called the Laplace transform.65
Interestingly enough, both retarded (i.e., causal) propagators and advanced
(i.e., non-causal) propagators play a crucial role in quantum ﬁeld theory.
From the mathematical point of view, the reason is that the relevant perturbation
theory depends on quantities which are constructed by using both retarded and
advanced propagators. Physicists interpret this by saying that
• the interaction between elementary particles is governed by virtual particles
(which are graphically represented by the internal lines of the Feynman dia-
grams), and
• the virtual particles violate basic laws of physics (e.g., the relation between energy
and momentum or causality).
7.6.2 The General Operator Calculus
The observation which comes closest to an explanation of the mathematical
concepts cropping up in physics which I know is Einstein’s statement that
the only physical theories which we are willing to accept are the beautiful
ones. It stands to argue that the concepts of mathematics, which invite
the exercise of much a wit, have the quality of beauty.66

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Let X be a complex separable ﬁnite-dimensional or inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert
space. We make the following assumption:
(A) The linear operator H : D(H) →X is self-adjoint.
This includes tacitly that the domain of deﬁnition D(H) is a linear dense subspace
of X. Von Neumann’s famous spectral theorem tells us the following.
Theorem 7.18 For each pair ϕ ∈D(H), χ ∈X, there exists a (complex-valued)
measure μχ,ϕ on the real line such that
⟨χ|Hϕ⟩=
Z
R
E · dμχ,ϕ(E).
We have ϕ ∈D(H) iﬀ
R
R |E|2dμϕ,ϕ(E) < ∞.
Furthermore, if ||ϕ|| = 1, then μϕ,ϕ is a classical probability measure, that is,
R
R dμϕ,ϕ = 1. In order to get a physical interpretation, assume that the operator
H is the Hamiltonian of a quantum system. Let ϕ be a unit vector in the Hilbert
space X, that is, ||ϕ|| = 1, and let Ω be an interval on the real line. Then the real
number
Z
Ω
dμϕ,ϕ(E)
is the probability of ﬁnding the quantum system in the state ϕ. Moreover,
¯E :=
Z
R
E · dμϕ,ϕ(E)
is the mean energy value measured in the state ϕ of the quantum system. Note
that this spectral theorem depends on the self-adjointness of the operator H, but
it fails for formally self-adjoint operators which are not self-adjoint. Therefore, as
it was discovered by von Neumann in 1929, the full probabilistic interpretation of
observables in quantum mechanics is only valid for self-adjoint operators.
Let F : R →C be a continuous function (or, more generally, a piecewise con-
tinuous and bounded function like the Heaviside function). Let D be the set of
all elements ϕ in X with
R
R |F(E)|2dμϕ,ϕ(E) < ∞. The von Neumann operator
calculus is based on the following fact.
Theorem 7.19 There exists a uniquely determined self-adjoint operator denoted
by F(H) : D →X such that, for all ϕ ∈D, χ ∈X, there holds the key relation
⟨χ|F(H)ϕ⟩=
R
R F(E) · dμχ,ϕ(E).
For example, if F(E) ≡1, then F(H) = I (unit operator), and for all χ, ϕ in X we
get ⟨χ|ϕ⟩=
R
R dμχ,ϕ.
Sketch of the proof. An elegant short proof of Theorems 7.18 and 7.19 can be
found in I. Sigal, Scattering Theory for Many-Body Quantum Mechanical Systems:
Rigorous Results, Springer, New York, 1983. In the spirit of the Dirac calculus, the
idea of Sigal’s proof is to use the regularized (rescaled) resolvent
δε(EI −H) := 1
2π · (H −(E + iε)I)−1,
E ∈R, ε > 0
with the typical property
w −
lim
E0→+∞
Z E0
−E0
δε(EI −H)dE = I,
ε > 0.
(7.103)

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
501
This justiﬁes the designation as a (regularized) operator delta function. Note that
we use the weak limit in (7.103).67
Step 1: The operator F(H) in the regular case: Let F →C be a smooth function
with compact support, that is, F ∈D(R). We use the key formula
Fε(H) := w −
lim
E0→+∞
Z E0
−E0
δε(EI −H)F(E)dE
and the limit formula
F(H) := w −lim
ε→+0 Fε(H)
in order to introduce the operator F(H) on the Hilbert space X. It can be shown
that the limits exist.
Step 2: The spectral family {Eλ}λ∈R of the operator H: We extend the deﬁnition
of the operator F(H) to more general (discontinuous) bounded functions F : R →C
which are the pointwise limit
F(E) = lim
n→∞Fn(E),
E ∈R
of an increasing sequence (Fn) of nonnegative functions Fn ∈D(R). In particular,
choosing the characteristic function eλ of the open interval ] −∞, λ[, we get the
operator Eλ(H).
Step 3: The spectral measure μ: For given ϕ ∈X with ||ϕ|| = 1, we deﬁne the
probability measure μϕ,ϕ on the real line by setting
Z
]−∞,λ[
dμϕ,ϕ(E) := ⟨ϕ|Eλϕ⟩.
This is the measure of the open interval ] −∞, λ[; the function λ →⟨ϕ|Eλϕ⟩
represents the distribution function of the measure μϕ,ϕ, in terms of the theory of
probability. More generally, for given ϕ, χ ∈X, we construct the (complex-valued)
measure μχ,ϕ on the real line by setting
Z
]−∞,λ[
dμχ,ϕ(E) = ⟨χ|Eλϕ⟩.
(7.105)
The spectral family of H has the following properties for all real numbers λ, λ0 and
all ϕ ∈X:
(S1) The operator Eλ : X →X is an orthogonal projection (i.e., the operator Eλ
is linear, continuous, self-adjoint, and E2
λ = Eλ).
(S2) The function λ →⟨ϕ|Eλϕ⟩is nondecreasing on the real line.
(S3) limλ→−∞Eλϕ = 0 and limλ→∞Eλϕ = ϕ.
(S4) limλ→λ0−0 Eλϕ = Eλ0ϕ.

67 Recall that, by deﬁnition, the weak limit
w −lim
n→∞ψn = ψ
(7.104)
exists on the Hilbert space X iﬀlimn→∞⟨ϕ|ψn⟩= ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩for all ϕ ∈X. In
particular, let ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . be a complete orthonormal system in X. Then the weak
convergence (7.104) is equivalent to the boundedness of the sequence (ψn) and
the convergence of all the Fourier coeﬃcients, that is, limn→∞⟨ϕk|ψn⟩= ⟨ϕk|ψ⟩
for all k.

502
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The spectral family {Eλ} of H is also called the spectral resolution of H.
Corollary 7.20 For any self-adjoint operator H : D(H) →X, there exists pre-
cisely one spectral family {Eλ} with the properties (S1)–(S4) such that Theorem
7.18 holds with (7.105). Explictly, the spectral family is given by the limit
⟨ψ|Eλϕ⟩= lim
δ→+0 lim
ε→+0
Z λ+δ
−∞
⟨ψ|(Rs−iε −Rs+iε)ϕ⟩ds
for all ψ, ϕ ∈X. Here, Rμ := (μI −H)−1 is the resolvent of H.
In terms of physics, the spectral family of the observable H uniquely determines the
probability measure of H. The proof of the Corollary can be found in K. J¨orgens
and F. Rellich, Eigenvalue Problems for Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations, p. 113,

Von Neumann’s generalized Fourier transform. Alternatively, von Neu-
mann’s spectral theorem above can be obtained from von Neumann’s diagonaliza-
tion theorem:
Each linear self-adjoint operator is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication
operator ˆf(λ) →λ ˆf(λ) on an appropriate function space.
This represents a far-reaching generalization of the classical Fourier transformation
f →ˆf. The precise formulation can be found in Sect. 12.2.3 of Vol. I in the setting
of the rigorous justiﬁcation of the Dirac calculus.
Gelfand’s theory of C∗-algebras. It was discovered by Gelfand in the 1940s
that one can use the theory of C∗algebras in order to construct von Neumann’s
operator calculus (see the monographs Maurin (1972) and Yosida (1995) quoted
above). Note that C∗-algebras play a fundamental role in quantum mechanics,
quantum ﬁeld theory, statistical physics, the Standard Model in particle physics,
quantum gravity, and quantum information. The point is that C∗-algebras allow us
to describe states and observables in a general setting. We will thoroughly study
this in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics (see also Sect. 7.16.3ﬀfor the deﬁnition
of C∗-algebras together with the construction of the Weyl quantization functor).
The Rellich–Kato perturbation theorem. The operator
H + C : D(H) →X
is self-adjoint if the following conditions are satisﬁed:
• The operator H : D(H) →X is self-adjoint.

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
503
• The perturbation C : D(C) →X is linear and symmetric, and the domain of
deﬁnition D(C) contains the set D(H).
• There are ﬁxed real numbers 0 ≤a < 1 and b ≥0 such that
||Cϕ|| ≤a||Hϕ|| + b||ϕ||
for all
ϕ ∈D(H).
In particular, the assumptions are satisﬁed if the operator C : X →X is linear,
symmetric, and continuous. The proof can be found in Zeidler (1995a), p. 417 (see
the references on page 1049). In 1951, this criterion was used by Kato in order to
prove that the Hamiltonian operators of molecules are essentially self-adjoint.
Classiﬁcation of the spectrum. As we will discuss below, every self-adjoint
operator H : D(H) →X generates a unique decomposition
X = Xbound ⊕Xscatt ⊕Xsing
(7.106)
of the Hilbert space X into pairwise orthogonal closed linear subspaces. It turns
out that, in terms of quantum mechanics,
• the elements of Xbound correspond to bound states of the quantum system,
• and the elements of Xscatt correspond to scattering states.
The elements of Xsing are called singular states. In regular situations, the singular
space Xsing is trivial, that is, it only consists of the zero element.68
(i) Bound states: The element ϕ of X is called an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian H
iﬀthere exists a real number E such that
Hϕ = Eϕ,
ϕ ̸= 0.
The number E is called the eigenvalue to the eigenstate ϕ.69 By deﬁnition, the
space Xbound is the closed linear hull of the eigenstates of H. The eigenstates
of H form a complete orthonormal system of Xbound.
(ii) Classiﬁcation of states by means of the spectral measure: Let the nonzero state
ϕ ∈X be given. Consider the spectral measure μϕ on the real line.70 Then:
• ϕ ∈Xbound iﬀμϕ is a point measure, that is, there exists a ﬁnite or countable
set Ω = {x1, x2, . . .} such that μϕ({xk}) > 0 for all k and μϕ(R \ Ω) = 0.
• ϕ ∈Xscatt iﬀthe measure μϕ has a density, that is, there exists a nonnegative
integrable function ϱ : R →R such that μϕ(Ω) =
R
Ω ϱ(x)dx for all intervals
Ω.71
• ϕ ∈Xsing iﬀthe measure μϕ is singular, that is, there exists a set Ω of
Lebesgue measure zero such that μϕ(Ω) > 0 and μϕ(R \ Ω) = 0.
The operator H maps each of the three Hilbert spaces Xbound, Xscatt and Xsing
into itself.
68 The importance of both the absolutely continuous spectrum and the subspace
Xscatt for the functional-analytic scattering theory will be discussed in Sect. 9
on page 747.
69 On page 526 we will introduce eigencostates (or generalized eigenfunctions). Such
costates do not always live in the inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert space X, but in
an extension of X. Observe that each eigenstate is an eigencostate, but the con-
verse is not always true. The eigenvalues of eigencostates are called generalized
eigenvalues.
70 To simplify notation, we write μϕ instead of μϕ,ϕ.
71 Equivalently, the monotone function λ →⟨ϕ|Eλϕ⟩is diﬀerentiable almost every-
where on R, and the ﬁrst derivative is integrable over R.

504
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• The spectrum of the restriction H : D(H) ∩Xbound →Xbound is called the
pure point spectrum σpp(H).
• The spectrum of the restriction H : D(H) ∩Xscatt →Xscatt is called the
absolutely continuous spectrum σac(H).
• The spectrum of the restriction H : D(H) ∩Xsing →Xsing is called the
singular spectrum σsing(H).
We have the following representation of the spectrum of the operator H:
σ(H) = σpp(H) ∪σac(H) ∪σsing(H).
The union σc(H) := σac(H)∪σsing(H) of the disjoint sets σac(H) and σsing(H)
is called the continuous spectrum of H.
Recall that σ(H) is a closed subset of the real line, and the open complement
ϱ(H) := C \ σ(H) is the resolvent set of H. We have E ∈ϱ(H) iﬀthe inverse
operator (EI −H)−1 : X →X (i.e., the resolvent) exists as a linear contin-
uous operator. We say that σpp(H) is empty iﬀXbound = {0}. An analogous
terminology will be used for σac(H) and σsing(H).
The discrete spectrum. By deﬁnition, the discrete spectrum σdisc of the
operator H is the set of all eigenvalues of ﬁnite multiplicity which are isolated
points of the spectrum σ(H).
The Weyl stability theorem for the essential spectrum. By deﬁnition,
the essential spectrum σess(H) of the operator H is the complement to the discrete
spectrum. That is, we have the disjoint decomposition
σ(H) = σdisc(H) ∪σess(H).
Explicitly, the essential spectrum contains precisely the following points:
• the eigenvalues of inﬁnite multiplicity,
• the accumulation points of the set of eigenvalues,
• the points of the continuous spectrum.
Weyl proved that we have E ∈σess(H) iﬀthere exists a sequence (ϕn) in the
domain of deﬁnition D(H) with
• limn→∞||Hϕn −Eϕn|| = 0;
• ||ϕn|| = 1 for all n and w −limn→∞ϕn = 0;
• the sequence (ϕn) has no convergent subsequence.
Such sequences are called Weyl sequences. The following theorem tells us that the
essential spectrum of the self-adjoint operator H is invariant under compact pertur-
bations. The linear operator C : X →X is called compact iﬀit is continuous and
each sequence (Cϕn) contains a convergent subsequence provided (ϕn) is bounded.
Theorem 7.21 Let H : D(H) →X be a self-adjoint operator, and let C be a
linear compact self-adjoint operator. Then the operator H + C is self-adjoint and
σess(H + C) = σess(H).
A variant of this theorem was proven by Weyl in 1909.72
Characterization of the spectrum by means of the spectral family. Let
H : D(H) →X be a linear self-adjoint operator on the complex Hilbert space X.
Set Pλ0ψ := limλ→λ0+0(Eλ −Eλ0)ψ for all ψ ∈X.

forms, Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 27 (1909), 373–392 (in German).

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
505
Theorem 7.22 (i) The real number λ0 is not contained in the spectrum σ(H) of
the operator H iﬀthe spectral family {Eλ}λ∈R is constant in some open neighborhood
of the point λ0.
(ii) The real number λ0 is an eigenvalue of H iﬀthe spectral family jumps at the
point λ0. That is, Pλ0 ̸= 0. The operator Pλ0 : X →X is the orthogonal projection
operator onto the eigenspace of H to the eigenvector λ0.
(iii) The real number λ0 is contained in the essential spectrum σess(H) iﬀ
dim(Eλ0+ε −Eλ0−ε)(X) = ∞for all ε > 0.

modern analysis together with applications can be found in the Appendix to Zeidler,

7.6.3 Rigorous Propagator Theory
The function ψ(t) = e−i(t−t0)H/ℏψ(t0), for all times t ∈R, describes the
dynamics of a quantum system corresponding to the self-adjoint Hamilto-
nian H.
Folklore
It is our goal to translate the formal propagator theory from Sect. 7.5.3 into a
rigorous mathematical setting.
Quantum Dynamics
The abstract Schr¨odinger equation. Consider the initial-value problem
iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hψ(t),
t > t0,
ψ(t0) = ψ0.
(7.107)
This is the basic equation in quantum mechanics.
Theorem 7.23 Let H : D(H) →X be a linear self-adjoint operator on the com-
plex separable Hilbert space X. For given initial state ψ0 ∈D(H), the Schr¨odinger
equation (7.107) has a unique, continuously diﬀerentiable solution ψ : [t0, ∞[→R.
Explicitly,
ψ(t) := e−i(t−t0)H/ℏψ0,
t ≥t0.
(7.108)
The operator e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ: X →X is unitary for all times t ∈X.
The proof can be found in H. Triebel, Higher Analysis, Sect. 22, Barth, Leipzig,
1989.
Generalized solution. For given initial value ψ0 ∈X, the function ψ = ψ(t)
is well-deﬁned by (7.108). This function is continuous on [0, ∞[. In contrast to this,
if ψ0 /∈D(H), then as a rule, it is not true that the derivative ˙ψ(t) exists. Therefore,
we call ψ(t) = e−i(t−t0)H/ℏψ0 with ψ0 ∈X a generalized solution of the Schr¨odinger
equation (7.107). This solution is deﬁned for all times t ∈R.
One-parameter unitary groups. By deﬁnition, a one-parameter unitary
group on the Hilbert space X is a family {U(t)}t∈R of operators with the following
properties:

506
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• U(t) : X →X is unitary for all times t ∈R.
• U(t + s) = U(t)U(s) for all t, s ∈R, and U(0) = I.
Such a group is called strongly continuous iﬀthe function t →U(t)ϕ0 is continuous
on the real line for all ϕ0 ∈X. The following classical result was proven by Stone
(1903–1989) in 1932. 73
Theorem 7.24 Let X be a complex separable Hilbert space.
(i) If {U(t)}t∈R is a strongly continuous, one-parameter unitary group on X,
then there exists a unique self-adjoint operator H : D(H) →X such that
U(t) = e−itH/ℏϕ0
for all
t ∈R.
(7.109)
We have Hϕ0 = limt→0
U(t)ϕ0−ϕ0
t
. This limit exists precisely iﬀϕ0 ∈D(H). The
operator H is called the generator of the one-parameter unitary group.
(ii) Conversely, if H : D(H) →X is a self-adjoint operator, then formula
(7.109) deﬁnes a strongly continuous, one-parameter unitary group on X.
The proof can be found in Zeidler, Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Applica-
tions, Vol. II/A, Sect. 19.21, Springer, New York, 1986.
The Feynman propagator. Let t, t0 ∈R. In terms of Theorem 7.23, the
unitary operator
P(t, t0) := e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ
on the Hilbert space X is called the propagator at time t (generated by the Hamil-
tonian H with respect to the initial time t0). The truncated operator74
P +(t, t0) := P(t, t0)θ(t −t0),
t ∈R
is called the retarded propagator (or the Feynman propagator) at time t (with
respect to the initial time t0.) Obviously, P(t0, t0) = I. We get
P(t, t0) = P(t, τ)P(τ, t0)
for all
t, τ, t0 ∈R.
This so-called reversible propagator equation (or group equation) follows from
U(t −τ)U(τ −t0) = U(t −τ + τ −t0) = U(t −t0),
which is the consequence of the fact that {U(t)}t∈R forms a group.
Euclidean Quantum Dynamics
The Euclidean Schr¨odinger equation. Consider the initial-value problem
˙ψ(t) = −Hψ(t),
t > t0,
ψ(t0) = ψ0.
(7.110)
We assume that the linear self-adjoint operator H : D(H) →X is nonnegative,
that is, ⟨ϕ|Hϕ⟩≥0 for all ϕ ∈D(H). Observe that both the diﬀusion equation
and the heat conduction equation are of this type. Since diﬀusion is an irreversible
process, we expect that the initial condition ψ0 does not uniquely determine the
state ψ(t) in the past t < t0. Mathematically, this is reﬂected by the fact that the
solution (7.111) below is not deﬁned for t < t0.
73 M. Stone, On one-parameter unitary groups in Hilbert space, Ann. Math. 33
(1932), 643–648.
74 Recall that θ(t−t0) := 1 if t ≥t0, and θ(t−t0) := 0 if t < t0 (Heaviside function).

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
507
Theorem 7.25 For given ψ0 ∈D(H), the Euclidean Schr¨odinger equation (7.110)
has a unique, continuously diﬀerentiable solution ψ : [t0, ∞[→R. This solution is
given by
ψ(t) = e−(t−t0)Hψ0,
t ≥t0.
(7.111)
The operator family {e−tH}t≥0 forms a non-expansive semigroup, that is, the linear
self-adjoint operators e−tH : X →X satisfy
e−tHe−sH = e−(t+s)H
for all
t, s ≥0,
as well as e−tH
|t=0 = I, and supt≥0 ||e−tH|| ≤1.
The proof can be found in H. Triebel, Higher Analysis, Sect. 22, Barth, Leipzig,
1989. In order to understand the speciﬁcs of the Euclidean quantum dynamics,
suppose that the nonnegative self-adjoint operator H : D(H) →X has a complete
orthonormal system ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . of eigenvectors with Hϕk = Ekϕk for all k. Then
Ek = Ek⟨ϕk|ϕk⟩= ⟨ϕk|Hϕk⟩≥0 for all k. For ψ0 ∈X, the Parseval equation tells
us that ||ψ0||2 = P∞
k=1 |⟨ϕk|ψ⟩|2. The series
e−tHψ0 =
∞
X
k=1
e−Ekt⟨ϕk|ψ⟩ϕk
(7.112)
is convergent iﬀP∞
k=0 e−2tEk|⟨ϕk|ψ⟩|2 < ∞. This is true if t ≥0 because of 0 ≤
e−Ekt ≤1. However, if t < 0, then the convergence of (7.112) can be violated. This
reﬂects the irreversibility of diﬀusion and heat conduction processes.
The Euclidean propagator. Let t ≥t0. The operator
P(t, t0) := e−(t−t0)H
is non-expansive on the Hilbert space X, that is supt≥t0 ||e−(t−t0)H|| ≤1. This
operator is called the Euclidean propagator at time t (generated by the Hamiltonian
H with respect to the initial time t0). Obviously, P(t0, t0) = I. Furthermore, we
have
P(t, t0) = P(t, τ)P(τ, t0)
for all
t ≥τ ≥t0.
This so-called irreversible propagator equation (or semi-group equation) follows
from e−(t−τ)He−(τ−t0)H = e−(t−τ+τ−t0)H = e−(t−t0)H, by Theorem 7.25.
Historical remarks. In the 19th century, mathematicians and physicists (e.g.,
Gauss, Green, Fourier, Riemann and Maxwell) discovered that one can use integral
formulas of the type
u(x) =
Z
G(x, y)f(y)dy
in order to represent the solutions u of partial diﬀerential equations of the form
Lu = f which appear in hydrodynamics, gas-dynamics, elasticity, heat conduction,
diﬀusion, and electrodynamics. The integral kernel G is called the Green’s function.
Functional analysis was founded by Hilbert in the early 1910s in order to gen-
eralize Fredholm’s theory of integral equations. At this time, diﬀerential equations
were reduced to integral equations with Green’s functions as integral kernels. In
von Neumann’s approach to quantum mechanics in the late 1920s, diﬀerential op-
erators were regarded as independent mathematical objects, namely, as self-adjoint
operators in a Hilbert space. In contrast to this, in his monograph

508
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Principles of Quantum Mechanics,
Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1930, Dirac used his calculus in order to construct (gener-
alized) integral kernels like the Dirac delta function. In the preface to his monograph
Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics,
Springer, Berlin 1932, von Neumann pointed out that he did not use Dirac’s method
because of lack of mathematical rigor.
In the 1940s, Feynman was strongly inﬂuenced by Dirac’s approach. The Feyn-
man propagators are nothing other than special Green’s functions. In the 1950s, the
two approaches due to Dirac and von Neumann were combined with each other by
Gelfand; he used Laurent Schwartz’s theory of generalized functions founded in the
1940s and Grothendieck’s theory of nuclear spaces. As a typical example, we will
consider the free quantum particle in Sect. 7.6.4. In the 1960s, the theory of pseudo-
diﬀerential operators was created by Kohn and Nirenberg; this approach represents
a further generalization of the theory of operator kernels. In quantum mechanics,
this is related to the Weyl calculus introduced in the late 1920s by Hermann Weyl
(see Sect. 7.12 on Weyl quantization).
Rigorous Operator Kernel
The operator kernel knows all about the operator.
Folklore
Let N = 1, 2, . . ., and let D be a dense subset of L2(RN). The linear continuous
operator A : L2(RN) →L2(RN) is said to have a continuous kernel iﬀthere exists
a continuous function A : R2N →C such that75
⟨χ|Aϕ⟩=
Z
R2N χ(x)†A(x, y)ϕ(y)dxNdyN
(7.113)
for all ϕ, χ ∈D. This kernel is unique. In fact, if A and B are two continuous kernels
corresponding to the operator A, then
Z
R2N (χ(x)ϕ(y)†)†(A(x, y) −B(x, y))dxNdyN = 0
for all ϕ, χ ∈D. Since the set of functions (x, y) →χ(x)ϕ(y)† with ϕ, χ ∈D is
dense in the complex Hilbert space L2(R2N), we obtain the desired result A(x, y) =
B(x, y) on R2N.
More generally, if relation (7.113) is true for a function A ∈L2(R2N), then this
function is uniquely determined (as an element of the Hilbert space L2(R2N) by
the operator A. The function A is called the L2-kernel of the operator A. Equation
(7.113) generalizes the matrix equation
χ†Aϕ =
n
X
j,k=1
χ†
jAjkϕk.
75 In classical mathematics, one uses (Aϕ)(x) =
R
RN A(x, y)ϕ(y)dyN. This is equiv-
alent to (7.113). However, the bilinear formulation (7.113) is crucial for deﬁning
the notion of kernel for generalized functions.

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
509
Therefore, the kernel (x, y) →A(x, y) can be regarded as a continuous version of
the complex (n × n)-matrix (Ajk). The kernel A is called self-adjoint iﬀ
A(x, y)† = A(y, x)
for all
x, y ∈RN.
This generalizes self-adjoint matrices. In 1904 Hilbert discovered the importance of
self-adjoint integral kernels for both
• the spectral theory of integral operators and
• the Fourier expansions to regular boundary-value problems for second-order or-
dinary diﬀerential equations (i.e., the regular Sturm–Liouville problems).
In 1910, Weyl generalized this to singular Sturm–Liouville problems which are
typical for computing the spectra of atoms and molecules in quantum mechanics.76
7.6.4 The Free Quantum Particle as a Paradigm of Functional
Analysis
Extend the pre-Hamiltonian to a self-adjoint operator on an appropriate
Hilbert space X of quantum states, and use costates related to a Gelfand
triplet with respect to X.
The golden rule
The modern theory of diﬀerential and integral equations is based on functional
analysis, which was created by Hilbert (1862–1943) in the beginning of the 20th
century.77 The development of functional analysis was strongly inﬂuenced by the
questions arising in quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory. In this section,
we want to study thoroughly how the motion of a free quantum particle on the real
line is related to fundamental notions in functional analysis.
This is Ariadne’s thread in functional analysis.
This way, the formal considerations from Sect. 7.5.3 will obtain a sound basis for
the free quantum particle.
The main idea of the modern strategy in mathematics and physics consists in
describing diﬀerential operators and integral operators by abstract operators related
to generalized integral kernels.
(i) In the language used by physicists, this concerns the Dirac calculus based on
Dirac’s delta function and Green’s functions (also called Feynman propaga-
tors).
(ii) In the language used by mathematicians this is closely related to:
• Lebesgue’s passage from the Riemann integral to the Lebesgue integral based
on measure theory in about 1900;
• von Neumann’s passage from formally self-adjoint operators to self-adjoint
operators and his generalization of the classical Fourier transform via spec-
tral theory in the late 1920s;
• Laurent Schwartz’s theory of generalized functions including the kernel the-
orem in the 1940s;
76 Weyl used methods on singular integral equations. These methods were devel-
oped in Weyl’s Ph.D. thesis advised by Hilbert in G¨ottingen in 1908.
77 As an introduction, we recommend P. Lax, Functional Analysis, Wiley, New
York, 2002, and E. Zeidler, Applied Functional Analysis, Vols. 1, 2, Springer,
New York, 1995.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• the generalization of von Neumann’s spectral theory by Gelfand and Kost-
yuchenko in 1955 (based on quantum costates as generalized functions and
the corresponding Gelfand triplets);
• the extension of the Gelfand–Kostyuchenko approach to general nuclear
spaces by Maurin in 1959.78
Tempered Distributions
In order to translate the very elegant, but formal Dirac calculus into math-
ematics, one has to leave the Hilbert space of states used by von Neumann
in about 1930.
Folklore
In what follows, we will use
• the space S(R) of smooth test functions ϕ : R →C which decrease rapidly at
inﬁnity,
• and the space S′(R) of tempered distributions introduced on page 615 of Vol. I.
Our basic tools will be
• the Fourier transform and
• the language of tempered distributions, and Gelfand triplets.
The main idea of our functional-analytic approach to the free quantum particle on
the real line is to study the three energy operators
Hpre ⊆Hfree ⊆Hd
pre.
Here, we start with Hpreϕ := −ℏ2
2m
d2ϕ
dx2 for all ϕ ∈S(R). This is the one-dimensional
Laplacian. We ﬁrst extend the (self-dual and formally self-adjoint) pre-Hamiltonian
Hpre : S(R) →S(R) on the space of test functions S(R) to the dual Hamiltonian
Hd
pre : S′(R) →S′(R)
on the space of tempered distributions. The restriction of the operator Hd
pre to the
Hilbert space L2(R) yields the self-adjoint Hamiltonian
Hfree : D(Hfree) →L2(R)
used by von Neumann. Here, S(R) ⊆D(Hfree) ⊆L2(R) where the domain D(Hfree)
of the free Hamiltonian Hfree is the Sobolev space W 2
2 (R). In general, Sobolev spaces
play a crucial role in the modern theory of linear and nonlinear partial diﬀerential
equations. We recommend:

The Schr¨odinger Equation
The instationary Schr¨odinger equation. The motion of a free quantum particle
of mass m > 0 on the real line is governed by the following initial-value problem
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t), x, t ∈R, ψ(0, x) = ψ0(x).
(7.114)
Here, the wave function ψ0 is given at the initial time t = 0.
The stationary Schr¨odinger equation. Using the classical Fourier ansatz
ψ(x, t) := e−itE/ℏϕ(x), equation (7.114) implies the eigenvalue problem
−ℏ2
2m ϕ′′(x) = Eϕ(x),
x ∈R.
(7.115)
We are looking for a nonzero function ϕ and a complex number E.
The Weyl lemma tells us that each solution of (7.115), in the sense of
distributions, is a classical smooth function.79
Explicitly, all the solutions of (7.115) are given by
ϕp(x) := eipx/ℏ
√
2πℏ
,
x ∈R
with the energy E(p) :=
p2
2m. Here, p is an arbitrary real number. For any p ∈R,
we have
−iℏdϕp
dx = pϕp.
The normalization factor of ϕp is chosen in such a way that we obtain the Parseval
equation (7.118) below.
The wave number. To simplify notation, physicists introduce the wave num-

Particle stream. If k > 0 (resp. k < 0), then the function
ψ(x, t) := e−itEk/ℏχk(x),
x, t ∈R
describes a homogeneous stream of free particles which moves from left to right
(resp. right to left). The particles of the stream have the momentum p = ℏk, the
velocity
v = ℏk
m ,
and the particle density ϱ = |χk|2 =
1
2π (see Sect. 7.4.1 on page 459).
The main trouble. The plane-wave functions χk possess a well-deﬁned physi-
cal meaning, but they do not live in the Hilbert space L2(R), since |χk(x)| = const
and hence
R
R |χk(x)|2dx = ∞.
Thus, the Hilbert space setting is not enough for studying quantum me-
chanics.
In order to overcome this diﬃculty, one has to introduce the concept of costates and
eigencostates (generalized eigenfunctions). This will be done below. Before study-
ing the Schr¨odinger equation (7.114) and its Hamiltonian Hfree, we will investigate
Gelfand triplets, the extended Fourier transform, Sobolev spaces, the position op-
erator, and the momentum operator.
The Extended Fourier Transform
We want to study the operators Fpre ⊆F ⊆F d
pre, where F : L2(R) →L2(R) is
unitary (i.e., F is a Hilbert space isomorphism). This is the key property of the
Fourier transform. As we will show below, in terms of physics the Fourier transform
describes the duality between position and momentum.
The classical Fourier transform. Recall that χk(x) :=
eikx
√
2π for all x ∈R
and all wave numbers k ∈R. In terms of the function χk, the Fourier transform ˆϕ
of the test function ϕ ∈S(R) reads as
ˆϕ(k) =
Z
R
χk(x)†ϕ(x) dx,
for all
k ∈R.
(7.116)
The inverse Fourier transform is given by
ϕ(x) :=
Z
R
χk(x) ˆϕ(k) dk
for all
x ∈R.
(7.117)
Here, the function ϕ is represented as a superposition of plane waves χk. For all
test functions ψ, ϕ ∈S(R), we have the crucial Parseval equation
Z
R
ψ(x)†ϕ(x) dx =
Z
R
ˆψ(k)† ˆϕ(k) dk,
(7.118)

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach

which shows that the Fourier transform respects the inner product on the Hilbert
space L2(R). Setting (Fpreϕ)(k) := ˆϕ(k) for all k ∈R, we obtain the operator
Fpre : S(R) →S(R)
called the classical Fourier transform (or the pre-Fourier transform). This operator
is linear, bijective, and sequentially continuous (see Vol. I, p. 614). Moreover, for
all ϕ, ψ ∈R, we have the following two relations:
(U) ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨Fpreψ|Fpreϕ⟩(pre-unitary), and
(S)
R
R ψ(x) · (Fpreϕ)(x) dx =
R
R(Fpreψ)(x) · ϕ(x) dx (self-duality).
Relation (U) coincides with the Parseval equation (7.118), whereas relation (S)
follows from interchanging integration. Explicitly,
Z
R
ψ(x)
„Z
R
e−ikxϕ(k)dk
«
dx =
Z
R
ϕ(k)
„Z
R
e−ikxψ(x)dx

dk.
Finally, use the replacement k ⇔x.
The Gelfand triplet. It is crucial to leave the Hilbert space L2(R) and to use
the extension S′(R) of L2(R) by considering the functions in L2(R) as tempered
distributions. To this end, we introduce the Gelfand triplet (also called the rigged
Hilbert space L2(R)):
S(R) ⊆L2(R) ⊆S′(R).
The elements of L2(R) (resp. S′(R)) are called states (resp. costates). Recall that
the inner product on the complex separable Hilbert space L2(R) is given by
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=
Z
R
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈L2(R).
The linear space S(R) of test functions is dense in L2(R). For any given function
ψ ∈L2(R), we deﬁne
Tψ(ϕ) :=
Z
R
ψ(x)ϕ(x)dx
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Then, Tψ is a tempered distribution. The map ψ →Tψ is an injective map from
L2(R) into S′(R). Therefore, we may identify ψ with Tψ. This will frequently be
done in the future, by using the symbol ψ instead of Tψ. In addition, if ψ ∈L2(R),
then we deﬁne the costate ⟨ψ| by setting
⟨ψ|(ϕ) :=
Z
R
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Here, the costate ⟨ψ| is a tempered distribution. Obviously, ⟨ψ|(ϕ) = ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩. Finally,
for k ∈R, let us deﬁne the costate ⟨k| by setting
⟨k|(ϕ) :=
Z
R
χ†
k(x)ϕ(x)dx
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Motivated by the Dirac calculus, we will write ⟨k|ϕ⟩instead of ⟨k|(ϕ). Let ϕ ∈S(R).
The relation to the Fourier transform is given by
⟨k|ϕ⟩= ˆϕ(k)
for all
k ∈R.

514
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The extended Fourier transform. Recall that Fpreϕ := ˆϕ for all test func-
tions ϕ ∈S(R). For any tempered distribution T ∈S′(R), deﬁne
(F d
preT)(ϕ) := T(Fpreϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
The operator F d
pre : S′(R) →S′(R) is linear and bijective. Next we want to show
that
F d
preψ = Fpreψ
for all
ψ ∈S(R).
(7.119)
Hence Fpre ⊆F d
pre. For the proof, ﬁx ψ ∈S(R). By the self-duality of the Fourier
transform considered on page 513,
F d
preTψ = TFpreψ.
Thus, identifying ψ with Tψ, we get the claim (7.119). Our key deﬁnition reads as
Fψ := F d
preψ
for all
ψ ∈L2(R).
In other words, the operator F is the restriction of the operator F d
rm to the Hilbert
space L2(R). The Plancherel theorem tells us that the operator
F : L2(R) →L2(R)
is unitary. That is, we have the Parseval equation ⟨Fψ|Fϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩for all functions
ψ, ϕ ∈L2(R). Explicitly,
(Fψ)(k) =
lim
R→+∞
1
√
2π
Z R
−R
e−ikxψ(x)dx
for all
k ∈R.
The convergence is to be understood in the sense of the Hilbert space L2(R).
Simplifying notation. Motivated by Fpre ⊆F ⊆F d
pre, we write F instead of
F d
pre (and Fpre). This way, we get the extended Fourier transform
F : S′(R) →S′(R)
with (FT)(ϕ) = T(Fϕ) for all T ∈S′(R) and all ϕ ∈S(R).
The Sobolev space W m
2 (R). Let m = 1, 2, . . . By deﬁnition,
W m
2 (R) := {ϕ ∈L2(R) : ϕ(j) ∈L2(R), j = 1, . . . , m}.
(7.120)
Here, the function ϕ and its jth derivatives ϕ(j), j = 1, 2, . . . , are to be understood
in the sense of tempered distributions (see (7.121)). Thus, W m
2 (R) ⊆S′(R). The
space W m
2 (R) becomes a complex separable Hilbert space equipped with the inner
product
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩:=
m
X
j=0
Z
R
ψ(j)(x)†ϕ(j)(x)dx.
In 1936, spaces of this type were introduced by Sobolev (1885–1967) in order to
study singular solutions of wave equations. The Fourier transform allows the fol-
lowing useful characterization of Sobolev spaces. Let m = 1, 2, . . .

Costates and Dual Operators
The theory of distributions is based on duality. Costates are dual states.
Folklore
Our goal is to construct eigencostates for the following observables: position, mo-
mentum, and energy of a free particle. The following investigations serve as prepa-
ration for this. Fix the state ψ ∈L2(R). There are two possibilities for assigning a
costate to ψ, namely,
• Tψ (i.e., Tψ(ϕ) :=
R
R ψ(x)ϕ(x)dx) for all ϕ ∈S(R)) , and
• Tψ† (i.e., Tψ†(ϕ) :=
R
R ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx for all ϕ ∈S(R)).
The map ψ →Tψ (resp. ψ →Tψ†) is injective and linear (resp. antilinear). Accord-
ing to Dirac, we set
⟨ψ| := Tψ†.
Moreover, we write |ψ⟩instead of ψ. In particular, for all ϕ ∈S(R),
⟨ψ|(ϕ) = Tψ†(ϕ) =
Z
R
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx = ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩.
Dual operators. In what follows, duality plays the crucial role. Let us assume
that
(H) The linear operator A : S(R) →S(R) is sequentially continuous.
This means that limn→∞ϕn = ϕ in S(R) implies limn→∞Aϕn = Aϕ in S(R) (see
Vol. I, p. 537). We want to construct the dual operator
Ad : S′(R) →S′(R).
To this end, choose T ∈S′(R), and deﬁne
(AdT)(ϕ) := T(Aϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈R.
Then AdT ∈S′(R). In fact, limn→∞ϕn = ϕ in S(R) implies
lim
n→∞(AdT)(ϕn) = lim
n→∞T(Aϕn) = T( lim
n→∞Aϕn) = T(Aϕ) = (AdT)(ϕ).
Obviously, the operator Ad is linear.
Formally self-adjoint operators and pre-observables. Suppose that there
exists a formally adjoint operator A† : S(R) →S(R) to the operator A from (H)
above (see Problem 7.4). Then
Ad⟨ψ| = ⟨A†ψ|
for all
ψ ∈S(R).
Indeed, for all ϕ ∈S(R), we obtain
(Ad⟨ψ|)(ϕ) = ⟨ψ|(Aϕ) = ⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨A†ψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨A†ψ|(ϕ).
In particular, if the operator A is formally self-adjoint (i.e., A = A†), then we obtain
Ad⟨ψ| = ⟨Aψ| for all ψ ∈S(R).
Self-dual operators and the Fourier transform. The operator A from (H)
above is called self-dual iﬀ

Z
R
ψ(x) · (Aϕ)(x)dx =

R
(Aψ)(x) · ϕ(x)dx
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈S(R).
Then (AdTψ) = TAψ for all ψ ∈S(R). Identifying ψ with Tψ, we obtain
Adψ = Aψ
for all
ψ ∈S(R).
Hence A ⊆Ad. To simplify notation, we frequently denote the dual operator Ad by
the symbol
A : S′(R) →S′(R),
and we regard this as an extension of the operator A : S(R) →S(R). A typical
example is the Fourier transform considered on page 512.
Antiself-dual operators and the derivative operator. The operator A
from (H) above is called antiself-dual iﬀ
Z
R
ψ(x) · (Aϕ)(x)dx = −
Z
R
(Aψ)(x) · ϕ(x)dx

Then −AdTψ = TAψ for all ψ ∈S(R). Identifying ψ with Tψ, we obtain
−Adψ = Aψ
for all
ψ ∈S(R).
Hence A ⊆(−Ad). To simplify notation, we frequently denote the operator −Ad
by the symbol
A : S′(R) →S′(R),
and we regard this as an extension of A : S(R) →S(R). As a typical example, let
us consider the derivative operator A :=
d
dx. Integration by parts shows that this
operator is antiself-dual.80 This way, we obtain the extension
d
dx : S′(R) →S′(R).
Let T ∈S′(R). Then ( d
dxT)(ϕ) = T(−dϕ
dx ) for all ϕ ∈S(R). This is the usual
deﬁnition of the derivative of a tempered distribution. More generally, let T ∈S′(R).
The nth derivative of T is deﬁned by
„dnT
dxn
«
(ϕ) := (−1)nT
„dnϕ
dxn
«
, n = 1, 2, . . .
(7.121)
for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R). This deﬁnition is based on the fact that the operator
dn
dxn : S(R) →S(R) is self-dual (resp. antiself-dual) if n is even (resp odd).
Each tempered distribution has derivatives of arbitrary order, which are
again tempered distributions.
80 For n = 1, 2, . . . and all ϕ, ψ ∈S(R), integration by parts yields

Eigencostates
For quantum mechanics, it is crucial to replace eigenvectors by eigen-
costates.
Folklore
Let A : S(R) →S(R) be a linear operator, and let {Tγ}γ∈Γ be a system of nonzero
tempered distributions Tγ ∈S′(R) with
AdTγ = λγTγ
for all
γ ∈Γ,
(7.122)
where λγ ∈C for all γ ∈Γ. Explicitly, this means that
Tγ(Aϕ) = λγT(ϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(R), γ ∈Γ.
Then all the distributions Tγ are called eigencostates (or generalized eigenfunctions)
of the operator A. The system {Tγ} is called complete iﬀ, for any given test function
ϕ ∈S(R),
Tγ(ϕ) = 0 for all γ ∈Γ
implies
ϕ = 0.
In addition, if there exists a measure μ on the index set Γ with the generalized
Parseval equation
Z
R
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx =
Z
Γ
Tγ(ψ)†Tγ(ϕ) dμ(γ)
(7.123)
for all ϕ, ψ ∈S(R), then the system {Tγ}γ∈Γ is called a complete orthonormal
system of eigencostates of the operator A. Obviously, the latter property is stronger
than completeness. In fact, if Tγ(ϕ) = 0 for all γ, then ⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩= 0, and hence ϕ = 0.
The complex numbers Tγ(ϕ) are called the generalized Fourier coeﬃcients of the
test function ϕ ∈S(R). The function
γ →Tγ(ϕ)
is called the generalized Fourier transform of the function ϕ ∈S(R) with respect
to the operator A.
The Dirac calculus. It turns out that the Dirac calculus represents a very
elegant method in order to formulate quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory
in a very elegant way. For ϕ ∈S(R), we use the following notation:
• Tγ ⇒⟨γ|,
• Tγ(ϕ) ⇒⟨γ|ϕ⟩, and
• ⟨ϕ|γ⟩:= ⟨γ|ϕ⟩†.
Then, the generalized Parseval equation (7.123) reads as
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=
Z
Γ
⟨ψ|γ⟩⟨γ|ϕ⟩dμ(γ)
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈S(R).
(7.124)
Mnemonically, in order to obtain (7.124) we write ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|·I ·|ϕ⟩together with
I =
Z
Γ
|γ⟩⟨γ| dμ(γ).
This is Dirac’s formal completeness relation.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The Position Operator
We want to study the following three operators Qpre ⊆Q ⊆Qd
pre.
• Let ϕ ∈S(R). The pre-position operator Qpre : S(R) →S(R) is deﬁned by
(Qpreϕ)(x) := xϕ(x) for all x ∈R. The operator Qpre is formally self-adjoint and
self-dual. 81
• Let T ∈S′(R). The dual position operator Qd
pre : S′(R) →S′(R) is deﬁned by
(Qd
preT)(ϕ) := T(Qpreϕ) for all ϕ ∈S(R). This means that
(Qd
preT)(ϕ) := T(Qpreϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
• The operator Q : D(Q) →L2(R) is the restriction of Qd
pre to L2(R). Explicitly,
we set
D(Q) := {ϕ ∈L2(R) :
Z
R
|xϕ(x)|2dx < ∞},
and (Qϕ)(x) := xϕ(x) for all x ∈R and all ϕ ∈D(Q).
The spectral family of the position operator. Fix λ ∈R, and choose
ϕ ∈L2(R). Deﬁne the operator Eλ : L2(R) →L2(R) by setting
(Eλϕ)(x) := eλ(x)ϕ(x)
for all
x ∈R,
(7.125)
where eλ is the characteristic function of the open interval ] −∞, λ[ (see (7.100) on
page 497).
Proposition 7.27 The operator family {Eλ}λ∈R is the spectral family of the self-
adjoint position operator Q : D(Q) →L2(R).
Proof. The self-adjointness of Q will be proved in Problem 7.15. For all functions
ϕ, ψ ∈L2(R),
⟨ψ|Eλϕ⟩=
Z ∞
−∞
ψ(x)†eλ(x)ϕ(x)dx =
Z λ
−∞
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx.
Hence
d
dλ⟨ψ|Eλϕ⟩= ψ(λ)†ϕ(λ). This implies d⟨ψ|Eλϕ⟩= ψ(λ)†ϕ(λ)dλ. Therefore,
⟨ψ|Qϕ⟩=
Z ∞
−∞
ψ(x)†xϕ(x) =
Z ∞
−∞
λ · d⟨ψ|Eλϕ⟩.
Finally, one checks easily that the conditions (S1)–(S4) for a spectral family (for-
mulated on page 502) are satisﬁed. By the uniqueness statement from Corollary
7.20 on page 502, {Eλ}λ∈R is the spectral family of Q.

Let the function f : R →C be measurable (e.g., piecewise continuous) and
bounded on all compact intervals. Deﬁne
D(f(Q)) := {ϕ ∈L2(R) :
Z
R
|f(x)|2|ϕ(x)|2dx < ∞}.
81 In fact, for all ϕ, ψ ∈S(R), we have
R
R ψ(x)† · xϕ(x)dx =
R
R(xψ(x))†ϕ(x)dx and
Z
R
ψ(x) · xϕ(x) dx =
Z
R
xψ(x) · ϕ(x) dx.

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
519
For all ϕ ∈D(f(Q)) and all ψ ∈L2(R), set
⟨ψ|f(Q)ϕ⟩:=
Z
R
f(λ) · d⟨ψ|Eλϕ⟩=
Z
R
ψ(x)†f(x)ϕ(x)dx.
This way, we uniquely obtain the linear operator f(Q) : D(f(Q)) →L2(R). This
operator is self-adjoint (resp. continuous on L2(R)) if the function f is real-valued
(resp. bounded on R).
Measurement of position. Let ψ ∈L2(R) with
R
R |ψ(x)|2dx = 1. According
to the general approach, the spectral family of the observable Q uniquely determines
the measurements of Q in the normalized state ψ.
• Distribution function F: The probability of measuring the observable Q in the
open interval ] −∞, λ[ is given by
F(λ) := ⟨ψ|Eλψ⟩=
Z λ
−∞
|ψ(x)|2dx.
This is the probability of measuring the position of the particle in the interval
] −∞, λ[.
• The probability for measuring the position of the particle in the interval [x0, x1]
is equal to
R
[x0,x1] dF(λ) =
R x1
x0 |ψ(x)|2dx.
• Mean position of the particle: ¯x =
R
R x dF(x) =
R
R x|ψ(x)|2dx.
• Square of the position ﬂuctuation:
(Δx)2 =
Z
R
(x −¯x)2 dF(x) =

(x −¯x)2|ψ(x)|2dx.
The complete orthonormal system of eigencostates of the position
operator.
Proposition 7.28 (i) The operator Q : D(Q) →L2(R) has no eigenvectors in the
Hilbert space L2(R).
(ii) For the spectrum, σ(Q) = σess(Q) = ] −∞, ∞[.
(iii) Xscatt = L2(R), and σac(Q) = σ(Q).
Proof. Ad (i). Suppose that Qψ = λψ, where ψ ∈L2(R) and λ ∈R. Then we
obtain (x −λ)ψ(x) = 0 for almost all x ∈R. Hence ψ(x) = 0 for almost all x ∈R.
Thus, ψ = 0 in L2(R).
Ad (ii). Use Theorem 7.22 on page 505 and (7.125).
Ad (iii). For any ϕ ∈L2(R), the function λ →⟨ϕ|Eλϕ⟩is diﬀerentiable almost
everywhere on R, and the ﬁrst derivative is integrable over R. Thus, ϕ ∈Xscatt (see
page 503).
2
Fix x ∈R. Let us consider the Dirac delta distribution δx ∈S′(R) deﬁned by
δx(ϕ) := ϕ(x) for all ϕ ∈S(R).
Proposition 7.29 The system {δx}x∈R represents a complete orthonormal system
of eigencostates of the position operator Qpre.
Proof. Let ϕ, ψ ∈S(R). For any parameter x ∈R,
Qd
preδx = xδx.
In fact, δx(Qpreϕ) = xϕ(x) = xδx(ϕ). Furthermore, we have the generalized Parse-
val equation ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=
R
R ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx =
R
R δx(ψ)†δx(ϕ)dx.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
In the setting of the Dirac calculus, physicists write ⟨x| instead of δx. Then
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=
Z
R
⟨ψ|x⟩⟨x|ϕ⟩dx
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈S(R).
Mnemonically, this remains true for all ψ, ϕ ∈L2(R). Dirac’s formal completeness
relation reads as
I =
Z
R
|x⟩⟨x| dx.
The relation between eigencostates and the spectral family. Set
ψ0(x) := e−x2/2
for all
x ∈R.
Then ψ0 ∈S(R). This function generates the (not normalized) Gaussian measure
μ(J) :=
Z
J
|ψ0(x)|2dx =
Z
J
e−x2 dx
for all intervals J on the real line. Fix λ ∈R. For all test functions ϕ ∈S(R), deﬁne
Tλ(ϕ) := d⟨ψ0|Eλϕ⟩
d⟨ψ0|Eλψ0⟩.
Proposition 7.30 The family {Tx}x∈R of tempered distributions with
Tx =
δx
ψ0(x)
represents a complete orthonormal system of eigencostates of the position opera-
tor Qpre. Using the Gaussian measure dμ(x) = ψ0(x)2dx, we have the generalized
Parseval equation
Z
R
ψ(x)†ϕ(x)dx =
Z
R
Tx(ψ)†Tx(ϕ) dμ(x)
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈S(R).
Proof. By the proof of Prop. 7.27, d⟨ψ0|Eλϕ⟩= ψ0(λ)ϕ(λ)dλ. Hence
Tλ(ϕ) = ψ0(λ)ϕ(λ)
ψ0(λ)2
= ϕ(λ)
ψ0(λ).
Finally, use δx(ϕ) = ϕ(x).

The square Q2 of the position operator. By von Neumann’s functional
calculus, the self-adjoint operator Q2 : D(Q2) →L2(R) has the domain of deﬁnition
D(Q2) = {ψ ∈L2(R) :
Z
R
x4|ψ(x)|2dx < ∞}.
For λ ∈R, we get (λI −Q2)ψ(x) = f(x). If λ < 0 and f ∈L2(R) then the function
(λI −Q2)−1f(x) =
f(x)
λ −x2 ,
x ∈R
is contained in L2(R). If λ ≥0, this is not the case for special choice of f. Hence
the spectrum of Q2 is equal to [0, ∞[. Let us compute the spectral family of Q2.
For all ϕ, ψ ∈L2(R),

of the function eλ can be found in (7.100) on page 497. In particular, Eλ0 = 0 if
λ0 ≤0.
Proposition 7.31 (i) The operator Q2 has no eigenvectors in the Hilbert space
L2(R).
(ii) For the spectrum σ(Q2) = σess(Q2) = σac(Q2) = [0, ∞[.
Proof. Ad (i). Use the same argument as for the operator Q above.
Ad (ii). Use the spectral family together with Theorem 7.22 on page 505.

The Momentum Operator
We want to study the following three operators Ppre ⊆P ⊆(−P d
pre).
• Let ϕ ∈S(R). The pre-momentum operator Ppre : S(R) →S(R) is deﬁned by
(Ppreϕ)(x) := −iℏd
dxϕ(x) for all x ∈R. The operator Ppre is formally self-adjoint
and antiself-dual.82
• Let T ∈S′(R). The dual momentum operator P d
pre : S′(R) →S′(R) is deﬁned by
(P d
preT)(ϕ) := T(Ppreϕ) for all ϕ ∈S(R). In the sense of tempered distributions,
we have
P d
pre = iℏd
dx.
This follows from iℏdT
dx (ϕ) = −iℏT(ϕ′) = T(Ppreϕ) for all ϕ ∈S(R).
• The operator P : D(P) →L2(R) is the natural extension of the operator Ppre.
Explicitly, we set D(P) := {ϕ ∈L2(R) : ϕ′ ∈L2(R)}, and
Pϕ := −iℏdϕ
dx
for all
ϕ ∈D(P).
Here, the derivative is to be understood in the sense of tempered distributions.
In other words, D(P) = W 1
2 (R).
The Fourier transform, and the duality between position and mo-
mentum. Choose χ := Ppreϕ where ϕ ∈S(R). For the Fourier transform, we get
ˆχ(k) = ℏk ˆϕ(k) for all k ∈R. Thus, the operator ℏ−1Ppre corresponds to the multi-
plication operator Qpre in the Fourier space. This means that the following diagram
is commutative:
82 In fact, for all ϕ, ψ ∈S(R), we have

Since the operator Q : D(Q) →L2(R) is self-adjoint and the property of self-
adjointness is invariant under unitary transformations, the position operator P :
D(P) →L2(R) is self-adjoint (see Problem 7.14).
The spectral family of the wave number operator. Recall that the
momentum p corresponds to the wave number k = ℏ−1p. Therefore, the oper-
ator K := ℏ−1P is called the wave number operator. Since the spectral family
of a self-adjoint operator is invariant under unitary transformations, we obtain
the spectral family {Eλ}λ∈R of the wave number operator K from the spectral
family {Eλ(Q)}λ∈R of the position operator Q in the Fourier space. Explicitly,
Eλ = F −1Eλ(Q)F for all λ ∈R. This means that, for all functions ϕ, ψ ∈L2(R)
and all real numbers λ, we get
⟨ψ|Eλϕ⟩=
Z λ
−∞
ˆψ(k)† ˆϕ(k)dk.
Proposition 7.32 The operator family {Eλ}λ∈R is the spectral family of the self-
adjoint wave number operator ℏ−1P : D(P) →L2(R).
Let the function f : R →C be measurable (e.g., piecewise continuous) and bounded
on all compact intervals. Deﬁne
D(f(K)) := {ϕ ∈L2(R) :
Z
R
|f(k)|2| ˆϕ(k)|2dk < ∞}.
For all ϕ ∈D(f(K)) and all ψ ∈L2(R), set
⟨ψ|f(K)ϕ⟩:=
Z
R
f(λ) · d⟨ψ|Eλϕ⟩=
Z
R
f(k) ˆψ(k)† ˆϕ(k)dk.
This way, we obtain the linear operator f(K) : D(f(K)) →L2(R). This operator
is self-adjoint (resp. continuous on L2(R)) if the function f is real-valued (resp.
bounded on R).
Measurement of the wave number. Let ψ ∈L2(R) with the normalization
condition
R
R |ψ(x)|2dx = 1. According to the general approach, the spectral family
of the observable K = ℏ−1P uniquely determines the measurements of the wave
number k = ℏ−1p in the normalized state ψ.

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach

able K in the open interval ] −∞, λ[ is given by
F(λ) := ⟨ψ|Eλψ⟩=

This is the probability of measuring the wave number k = ℏ−1p of the particle
in the open interval ] −∞, λ[.

Moreover, we get the mean momentum ¯p = ℏ¯k and the mean momentum ﬂuctuation
Δp = ℏΔk.
The complete orthonormal system of eigencostates of the momentum
operator.
Proposition 7.33 (i) The operator P : D(P) →L2(R) has no eigenvectors in the
Hilbert space L2(R).
(ii) For the spectrum, σ(P) = σess(P) = ] −∞, ∞[.
(iii) Xscatt = L2(R), and σac(P) = σ(P).
This follows from Prop. 7.28 on page 519 and from the fact that the wave number
operator ℏ−1P is unitarily equivalent to the position operator Q.
Proposition 7.34 The system {⟨k|}k∈R represents a complete orthonormal system
of eigencostates of the momentum operator Ppre.
Proof. Let ϕ, ψ ∈S(R). For any parameter k ∈R,
P d

7.6.5 The Free Hamiltonian
The free Hamiltonian is a paradigm for general Hamiltonians in quantum
mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory.
Folklore
The functional-analytic approach to quantum dynamics is based on the study of the
energy operator (also called the Hamiltonian). In this section, we want to investigate
thoroughly the Hamiltonian Hfree of the free quantum particle on the real line, which
is called the free Hamiltonian. The two key operator equations are the instationary
Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hfreeψ(t), t > t0,
ψ(t0) = ψ0
(7.126)
with the solution ψ(t) = e−i(t−t0)Hfree/ℏψ0 (the Feynman propagator) and the in-
homogeneous stationary Schr¨odinger equation
Hfreeϕ = Eϕ + f
(7.127)
with the solution ϕ = (Hfree −EI)−1f (the energetic Green’s operator). Here, we
have to assume that the complex energy E is not contained in the spectrum σ(Hfree)
of the free Hamiltonian. We will show that:

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
525
• The Feynman propagator kernel K describes the solution of the initial-value
problem for the instationary Schr¨odinger equation (7.126),
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t),
ψ(t0, x) = ψ0(x),
by means of the integral formula
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
K(x, t; x0, t0)ψ0(x0)dx0,
t > t0, x ∈R.
• The energetic Green’s function G describes the solution of the inhomogeneous
stationary Schr¨odinger equation (7.126),
−ℏ2
2mϕ′′(x) = Eϕ(x) + f(x),
x ∈R, E ∈C,
by means of the integral formula
ϕ(x) =
Z
R
G(x, x0; E)f(x0)dx0,
x ∈R, E ∈C \ σ(Hfree)
where σ(Hfree) = [0, ∞[.
The energetic Green’s function carries the information on the energy spectrum of
the particle.
The Feynman propagator kernel K and the energetic Green’s function G
are related to each other by the Laplace transform.
This corresponds to
• the duality between energy and time, and
• the duality between causality and analyticity,
which is crucial for both quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory.
Using the results on the momentum operators Ppre ⊆P ⊆P d
pre obtained on
page 521, we want to study the energy operators Hpre ⊆Hfree ⊆Hd
pre.
• The pre-Hamiltonian Hpre : S(R) →S(R) is deﬁned by
Hpre := P 2
pre
2m .
Explicitly, Hpreϕ = −ℏ2
2m ϕ′′ for all ϕ ∈S(R). The operator Hpre is formally
self-adjoint and self-dual.
• The operator Hd
pre : S′(R) →S′(R) is deﬁned by Hd
pre :=
(P d
pre)2
2m
. For any
tempered distribution T ∈S′(R),
Hd
preT = −ℏ
2m
d2T
dx2 .
• By von Neumann’s functional calculus, the operator P 2 : D(P 2) →L2(R) is
self-adjoint, and D(P 2) = {ψ ∈L2(R) :
R
R |k2 ˆψ(k)|2dk < ∞}. By Prop. 7.26,
D(P 2) = W 2
2 (R).
• We deﬁne the self-adjoint free Hamiltonian Hfree : D(Hfree) →L2(R) by setting
Hfree := P 2
2m. Hence D(Hfree) = W 2
2 (R).

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Eigencostates. Recall that ⟨k|ϕ⟩= ˆϕ(k) for all ϕ ∈S(R), where ˆϕ is the
Fourier transform of ϕ. Moreover, following Dirac, we set ⟨ϕ|k⟩:= ⟨k|ϕ⟩†. Recall
that Ek := ℏ2k2
2m
is the energy of a classical free particle on the real line which has
the momentum p = ℏk.
Proposition 7.36 The system {⟨k|}k∈R is a complete orthonormal system of
eigencostates of the energy operator Hpre. Explicitly,
(a) Hd
pre⟨k| = Ek⟨k|
for all wave numbers k ∈R.
(b) ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=
R
R⟨ψ|k⟩⟨k|ϕ⟩dk
for all ψ, ϕ ∈L2(R).
Proof. Since P d
pre⟨k| = ℏk⟨k|, we get Hd
pre⟨k| =
(P d
pre)2
2m
⟨k| = (ℏk)2
2m ⟨k|. This is (a).
Claim (b) coincides with the Parseval equation for the Fourier transform.
2
In terms of distribution theory, the costate ⟨k| corresponds to the function
χ†
k(x) = e−ikx
√
2π for all x ∈R. Passing from k to −k, claim (a) is equivalent to
−ℏ2
2m
d2χk
dx2 = ℏ2k2
2m · χk
for all
k ∈R.
The elements of the Hilbert space L2(R) correspond to states of a single particle.
The function χk is not a state, but it describes a particle stream, as discussed on
page 512.
The spectrum of the free Hamiltonian Hfree acting in the Hilbert
space X of states. We have Xscatt = L2(R) and
σ(Hfree) = σac(Hfree) = σess(Hfree) = [0, +∞[.
That is, the spectrum of the free Hamiltonian Hfree contains all the energy values
E ≥0. The spectrum coincides with both the absolutely continuous spectrum and
the essential spectrum. The pure point spectrum is empty, that is, there is no state
of the free quantum particle on the real line which has a sharp energy. In other
words, there are no bound states. In addition, the singular spectrum is empty. The
resolvent set of the operator Hfree is given by ϱ(Hfree) = C \ [0, +∞[.
The proof follows from the corresponding properties of the operator Q2 and the
fact that the operator ℏ−2P 2 is unitarily equivalent to Q2, by Fourier transform
(see page 520).
The quantum dynamics: We will use Theorem 7.23 together with the Stone
theorem on page 505ﬀ. Set P(t, t0) := e−i(t−t0)Hfree/ℏ. For all times t, t0 ∈R, the
operator
P(t, t0) : L2(R) →L2(R)
is unitary. For each given initial state ψ0 ∈L2(R) at time t0, we set
ψ(t) := P(t, t0)ψ0,
t ∈R.
The function t →ψ(t) describes the motion of the free quantum particle on the
real line with the initial condition ψ(t0) = ψ0. If ψ0 ∈D(Hfree) (e.g., we choose
ψ0 ∈S(R)), then the function ψ : [0, ∞[→L2(R) is continuously diﬀerentiable, and
we have the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏ˙ψ(t) = Hfreeψ(t),
t ∈R,
ψ(t0) = ψ0.

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
527
The operator P(t, t0) is called the propagator of the free quantum particle at time
t (with respect to the initial time t0). In terms of the unitary Fourier transform
F : L2(R) →L2(R), the propagator P(t, t0) corresponds to the multiplication
with the function k →e−i(t−t0)Ek/ℏin the Fourier space. This means that, for all
ψ0 ∈L2(R), we get
P(t, t0)ψ0 = F −1MFψ0,
t, t0 ∈R
with the multiplication operator (M ˆψ0)(k) := e−i(t−t0)Ek/ℏˆψ0(k) for all wave num-
bers k ∈R.
The spectral measure of the free Hamiltonian Hfree. Let the function
F : [0, ∞[→C be continuous (or piecewise continuous) and bounded. Then, for all
χ, ϕ ∈S(R),
⟨χ|F(Hfree)ϕ⟩=

E > 0.
Here, k :=
√
2mE/ℏ. Moreover, ˆχ (resp. ˆϕ) is the Fourier transform of χ (resp.
ϕ) from (7.116). Formula (7.128) can be uniquely extended to all χ, ϕ ∈L2(R).
The operator F(Hfree) : X →X is linear and continuous. Formula (7.128) remains
valid if we replace the function F by its complex-conjugate function F † and the
operator F(Hfree) by its adjoint operator F(Hfree)†, respectively. If the function F
is real-valued, then the operator F(Hfree) is self-adjoint. Furthermore,
⟨χ|Hfreeϕ⟩=

The spectral family of the free Hamiltonian Hfree. Let λ ∈R. Choosing

eλ(E)ϱχ,ϕ(E)dE
for all

In particular, if λ ≤0, then Eλ(Hfree) = 0.
Measurements of the energy. Let ϕ ∈S(R) be a normalized state in the
Hilbert space L2(R) (i.e.,
R
R |ϕ(x)|2dx = 1). This state describes a free quantum

For all positions x, x0 ∈R and times t > t0, deﬁne
K(x, t; x0, t0) :=
r
m
2πiℏ(t −t0) · eim(x−x0)2/2ℏ(t−t0).
Let ψ0 ∈S(R). Then we have the following integral representation of the quantum
dynamics:
`
P(t, t0)ψ0
´
(x) =
Z
R
K(x, t; x0, t0)ψ0(x0)dx0,
x ∈R, t > t0.
This is the key formula for solving the initial-value problem for the instationary
Schr¨odinger equation (7.126) on page 524. For all χ, ϕ ∈S(R), we obtain the kernel
formula
⟨χ|P(t −t0)ϕ⟩=
Z
R2 χ(x)†K(x, t; x0, t0)ϕ(x0)dxdx0,
t > t0.
For t > t0, the function (x, y) →K(x, t; y, t0) is called the Feynman propagator
kernel of the free quantum particle.
The Euclidean Propagator Kernel
Set PEuclid(t, t0) := e−(t−t0)Hfree/ℏ. The operator
PEuclid(t, t0) : L2(R) →L2(R),
t ≥t0
is linear, continuous, and nonexpansive, that is, ||PEuclid(t, t0)|| ≤1 for all t ≥t0.
For each given initial state ψ0 ∈L2(R) at time t0, we set
ψ(t) := PEuclid(t, t0)ψ0,
t ≥t0.
If ψ0 ∈S(R), then the function ψ : [0, ∞[→L2(R) is continuously diﬀerentiable,
and we have the Euclidean Schr¨odinger equation
ℏ˙ψ(t) = −Hfreeψ(t),
t > t0,
ψ(t0) = ψ0.
(7.129)
The operator PEuclid(t, t0) is called the Euclidean propagator of the free quantum
particle at time t (with respect to the initial time t0). In terms of the unitary Fourier
transform F : L2(R) →L2(R), the Euclidean propagator P(t, t0) corresponds to
the multiplication with the function k →e−(t−t0)Ek/ℏin the Fourier space. This
means that, for all initial states ψ0 ∈L2(R), we get
PEuclid(t, t0)ψ0 = F −1MFψ0,
t ≥t0
with the multiplication operator (M ˆψ0)(k) := e−(t−t0)Ek/ℏˆψ0(k) for all k ∈R. For
all positions x, x0 ∈R and all times t > t0, deﬁne
P(x, t; x0, t0) =
r
m
2πℏ(t −t0) · e−m(x−x0)2/2ℏ(t−t0).
Then we have the following integral representation:

This is the key formula for solving the initial-value problem for the Euclidean
Schr¨odinger equation (7.129). For all χ, ϕ ∈L2(R), we obtain the kernel formula
⟨χ|PEuclid(t, t0)ϕ⟩=
Z
R2 χ(x)†P(x, t; x0, t0)ϕ(x0)dxdx0,
t > t0.
For t > t0, the function (x, x0) →P(x, t; x0, t0) is called the Euclidean propagator
kernel of the free quantum particle.

which passes over to the stationary Schr¨odinger equation (7.115) if f(x) ≡0. Equa-
tion (7.130) corresponds to the operator equation
Hfreeϕ −Eϕ = f,
ϕ ∈D(Hfree).
(7.131)
We want to solve this equation. Let E ∈ϱ(Hfree) (i.e., E ∈C \ [0, ∞[). Then the
resolvent
(EI −Hfree)−1 : L2(R) →L2(R)
exists as a linear continuous operator. For given f ∈L2(R), the equation (7.131)
has the unique solution
ϕ = (Hfree −EI)−1f.
Von Neumann’s operator calculus tells us that for all χ, f ∈L2(R), we have

The retarded Green’s function. Our goal is to represent the solution of the
inhomogeneous Schr¨odinger equation (7.130) by an integral formula. To this end,
we introduce the function

,
x, y ∈R.
(7.132)
Here, k :=
√
2mE/ℏ. We assume that ℑ(E) > 0. The square root is to be understood
as principal value. This choice of the complex energy E guarantees that the function
G+ decays exponentially as |x −y| →∞.
Proposition 7.37 Let ℑ(E) > 0. For given f ∈S(R), the unique solution of the
inhomogeneous Schr¨odinger equation (7.130) reads as
ϕ(x) =

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The proof will be given in Sect. 8.5.2 on page 731. By Prop. 7.37, we get
⟨χ|(Hfree −EI)−1ϕ⟩=
Z
R2 χ(x)†G+(x, y; E)ϕ(y)dxdy,
ℑ(E) > 0
for all χ, ϕ ∈S(R). Therefore the function (x, y) →G+(x, y; E) is the kernel of the
(negative) resolvent (Hfree −EI)−1; this kernel is called the retarded (energetic)
Green’s function of the Hamiltonian Hfree. Note that, for ﬁxed y ∈R, the retarded
Green’s function behaves like
• eikx as x →+∞, and
• e−ikx as x →−∞where k > 0.
This corresponds to outgoing waves at inﬁnity, x = ±∞.
The advanced Green’s function. Now we pass from the positive wave num-
ber k to the negative wave number −k, that is, we change outgoing waves into
ingoing waves at inﬁnity. To this end, deﬁne
G−(x, y; E) := −im · e−ik|x−y|
ℏ2k
,
x, y ∈R.
(7.134)
Here, k := −
√
2mE/ℏ. We assume that ℑ(E) < 0. The square root is to be under-
stood as principal value. This choice of the complex energy E guarantees that the
function G−decays exponentially as |x −y| →∞.
Proposition 7.38 Let ℑ(E) < 0. For given f ∈S(R), the unique solution of the
inhomogeneous Schr¨odinger equation (7.130) reads as
ϕ(x) =
Z
R
G−(x, y; E)f(y)dy,
x ∈R.
Thus, for all χ, ϕ ∈S(R) we obtain
⟨χ|(Hfree −EI)−1ϕ⟩=
Z
R2 χ(x)†G−(x, y; E)ϕ(y)dxdy.
This means that the function (x, y) →G−(x, y; E) is the kernel of the (negative)
resolvent (Hfree −EI)−1; this kernel is called the advanced (energetic) Green’s
function of the Hamiltonian Hfree. Note that, for ﬁxed y ∈R, the advanced Green’s
function behaves like
• e−ikx as x →+∞and
• eikx as x →−∞where k > 0.
This corresponds to incoming waves at inﬁnity, x = ±∞.
The Fourier–Laplace transform of the Feynman propagator kernel.
Fix the initial-time t0. Then, for all times t > t0, all positions x, y ∈R, and all
complex energies E in the open upper half-pane (i.e., ℑ(E) > 0), we have

The global energetic Green’s function. The retarded Green’s function
is holomorphic in the open upper half-plane. This function can be analytically
continued to a global analytic function on a double-sheeted Riemann surface. This

E. Here, the function E →k(E) has to be regarded as
a global analytic function deﬁned on the Riemann surface R of the square-root
function √

713. In terms of R, the retarded (resp. advanced) Green’s function is deﬁned on
the open upper (resp. lower) half-plane of the ﬁrst sheet of the Riemann surface R.
The two functions jump along the positive real axis (see Fig. 8.6 on page 714).
Perturbation of the Free Quantum Dynamics
If the motion of the free particle on the real line is perturbed by the potential U,
then we get the perturbed Schr¨odinger equation
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t) + U(x)ψ(x, t),
x ∈R, t > t0, ψ(x, t0) = ψ0.
(7.135)
This is the prototype of a quantum system under interaction. Let us introduce the
Hamiltonian
Hϕ := −ℏ2
2m
d2ϕ
dx2 + Uϕ
for all
ϕ ∈W 2
2 (R).
In other words, H = Hfree + U.
Theorem 7.39 If the function U : R →R is smooth and has compact support,
then the Hamiltonian H : W 2
2 (R) →L2(R) is self-adjoint.
Proof. Let x ∈R. Deﬁne the operator C : L2(R) →L2(R) by setting
(Cϕ)(x) := U(x)ϕ(x)
for all
ϕ ∈L2(R).
Then ||Cϕ|| ≤const · ||ϕ|| for all ϕ ∈L2(R). In fact,
⟨Uϕ|Uϕ⟩=
Z
R
ϕ(x)†U(x)2ϕ(x)dx ≤const

|ϕ(x)|2dx.
Since the operator Hfree : W 2
2 (R) →L2(R) is self-adjoint, it follows from the
Rellich–Kato perturbation theorem on page 502, that the perturbed operator
H = Hfree + C is also self-adjoint on W 2
2 (R).

A detailed study of equation (7.135) can be found in Chap. 8. This concerns

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The Beauty of Harmonic Analysis
The motion of a free quantum particle is governed by the Fourier transform. Let us
explain the relation to the translation group on the real line. For each a ∈R, the
transformation
Tax := x + a
for all
x ∈R
represents a translation of the real line. For each smooth function ψ : R →C, we
deﬁne the operator
(Taψ)(x) := ψ(T −1
a x).
Explicitly, Taψ(x) = ψ(x −a). The operator D deﬁned by
Dψ(x) := lim
a→0
Taψ(x) −ψ(x)
a
= −ψ′(x)
for all
x ∈R
is called the inﬁnitesimal translation. By Taylor expansion,
Taψ(x) = ψ(x) + Dψ(x) + 1
2D2ψ(x) + 1
3!D3ψ(x) + . . .
The Fourier transform is related to the eigenfunctions χk(x) := eikx
√
2π of the inﬁnites-
imal operator D. Explicitly,
iℏDχk = ℏkχk,
k ∈R.
Note that iℏD corresponds to the momentum operator on the real line. If we replace
the translation group by another Lie group, then we get a generalization of the
preceding situation which leads to
• more general inﬁnitesimal transformations (diﬀerential operators),
• more general eigenfunctions (special functions of mathematical physics),
• and a generalization of the Fourier transform.
This is the subject of a beautiful branch in mathematics called harmonic analysis,
which will be encountered quite often in this treatise. In the 20th century, the
protagonist of harmonic analysis was Hermann Weyl (1885–1955). We recommend:

7.6.6 The Rescaled Fourier Transform
The rescaled Fourier transform ﬁts best the duality between position and
momentum of quantum particles in the setting of the Dirac calculus.

equation (7.138) below. Let ϕ, ψ ∈S(R). The rescaled Fourier transform is given
by the following two formulas
˜ϕ(p) =

for all
p ∈R
(7.136)

The classical Fourier transform is obtained by choosing ℏ:= 1. Setting Fℏϕ := ˜ϕ,
we obtain the linear, bijective, sequentially continuous operator
Fℏ: S(R) →S(R)
which is called the rescaled Fourier transform. As in Sect. 7.6.4, this operator can
be extended to a linear bijective operator
Fℏ: S′(R) →S′(R)
such that the restriction Fℏ: L2(R) →L2(R) is unitary. The commutative diagram
D(P)

momentum costate ⟨p| by setting
⟨p|(ϕ) :=
Z
R
ϕ†
p(x)ϕ(x)dx,
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Mnemonically, we write this as ⟨p|ϕ⟩. Replacing the wave number costate ⟨k| from
Sect. 7.6.4 by the momentum costate ⟨p|, we get the following formulas of the Dirac
calculus:
• ⟨p|ϕ⟩= ˜ϕ(p),
• I =

• P d
pre⟨p| = p ⟨p|,
• Hd
pre⟨p| = E(p) ⟨p| with the energy value E(p) :=
p2
2m.
The system {⟨p|}p∈R forms a complete orthonormal system of costates for both the
momentum operator Ppre and the free Hamiltonian Hpre. Adding the mnemonical
formulas
• ⟨x|ϕ⟩= ϕ(x) and ⟨x|p⟩= ϕp(x),
• I =
R
R |x⟩⟨x| dx,

⟨x|ϕ⟩=

⟨x|p⟩⟨p|ϕ⟩dp

⟨ψ|ϕ⟩=
Z
R
⟨ψ|x⟩⟨x|ϕ⟩dx =

⟨ψ|p⟩⟨p|ϕ⟩dp.
This shows that the rescaled Fourier transform is nothing else than a change from
the position coordinate x to the momentum coordinate p which respects “inner
products.”
Note that, as a rule, physicists use the wave number costates ⟨k| in scattering
theory, and the momentum costates ⟨p| in the Feynman path integral approach. We
will follow this convention.
7.6.7 The Quantized Harmonic Oscillator and the Maslov Index
The global behavior of the quantized harmonic oscillator is governed by
the Morse indices (also called Maslov indices) of the classical harmonic
oscillator.
Folklore
Let us continue the study of the quantized harmonic oscillator on the real line
started in Sect. 7.4.4 on page 467. The initial-value problem for the corresponding
Schr¨odinger equation reads as
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t) + mω2x2

ψ(x, t),
ψ(x, t0) = ψ0(x)

(i) The self-adjoint Hamiltonian H: The point is that the eigenfunctions ϕ0, ϕ1, . . .
form a complete orthonormal system in the Hilbert space. The pre-Hamiltonian
Hpre can be extended to the self-adjoint operator H : D(H) →L2(R) given by
Hϕ :=

Here, ϕ ∈D(H) iﬀthis series is convergent in the Hilbert space L2(R), that
is, P∞

n|⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩|2 < ∞. The operator H is called the Hamiltonian of the
quantized harmonic oscillator.
(ii) The spectrum of the Hamiltonian H: The spectrum σ(H) consists of the energy
values E0, E1, E2, . . . of the quantized harmonic oscillator. This is a pure point
spectrum; the absolutely continuous spectrum, the essential spectrum, and the
singular spectrum of H are empty.
(iii) The kernel theorem: Let λ0, λ1, . . . be complex numbers. Consider the operator
A : D(A) →L2(R) given by
Aϕ =

n=0
λn⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩ϕn.
(7.140)
We assume that the domain of deﬁnition D(A) consists of all the functions
ϕ ∈L2(R) for which the series on the right-hand side of (7.140) is convergent
in L2(R), that is, ϕ ∈D(A) iﬀP∞

λnϕn(x)ϕn(y)†,
(x, y) ∈R2
(7.141)
is convergent in the Hilbert space L2(R2), and the operator A has the L2(R2)-
kernel A. That is, for all ϕ, χ ∈L2(R), we have
(Aϕ)(x) =

If all the numbers λ0, λ1, . . . are real, then the operator A is self-adjoint.
(b) Trace-class operator: If P∞
n=0 |λn| < ∞, then (i) is valid. The operator
A : L2(R) →L2(R) is called a trace class (or nuclear) operator; its trace is
given by tr(A) = P∞

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
(c) The Schwartz kernel T: If the condition supn |λn| < ∞is satisﬁed, then
the operator A : X →X is linear and continuous. There exists a uniquely
determined tempered distribution T ∈S′(R2) such that
⟨χ|Aϕ⟩= T(χ† ⊗ϕ)
for all
χ, ϕ ∈S(R).
More precisely, there exist a continuous function A : R2 →C of polynomial
growth and nonnegative integers r and s such that
T(χ† ⊗ϕ) =
Z
R2 χ(r)(x)†A(x, y)ϕ(s)(y)dxdy
for all χ, ϕ ∈S(R).
Proof. Ad (a). Since the functions ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . form a complete orthonormal
system in the Hilbert space L2(R), the tensor products
(ϕ†
k ⊗ϕl)(x, y) := ϕk(x)†ϕ(y),
(x, y) ∈R2,
k, l = 0, 1, . . .
represent a complete orthonormal system in the Hilbert space L2(R2) (see Zei-
dler (1995a), p. 224). Consequently, the series (7.141) is convergent in L2(R2)
iﬀP∞
n=0 |λn|2 < ∞. The remaining claims are standard results in functional
analysis (see Zeidler (1995a), Sect. 4.4).
Ad (b). If P∞
n=0 |λn| < ∞, the limn→∞λn = 0. Consequently, there exists a
natural number n0 such that P∞
n=n0 |λn|2 ≤P∞
n=n0 |λn|.
Ad (c). This is the Schwartz kernel theorem. The proof can be found in I.

(iv) The resolvent and the energetic Green’s function of the Hamiltonian H: Let the
complex number E be diﬀerent from all the eigenvalues E0, E1, . . . Introduce
G(E) := (H −EI)−1. Then the energetic Green’s operator
G(E) : L2(R) →L2(R)
is linear and continuous. Explicitly,
G(E)ϕ =

The operator R(E) := −G(E) is called the resolvent of H.

(v) The Euclidean propagator kernel: Let t > t0. Set β := (t−t0)/ℏ. Since the series
P∞
n=0 e−βEn is convergent, it follows from Theorem 7.40(ii) that the Euclidean
propagator PEuclid(t, t0) := e−βH is a trace-class operator on L2(R), and it has
an L2(R2)-kernel given by the series
P(x, t; y, t0) :=

X
n=0
e−βEnϕn(x)ϕn(y)†,
which is convergent in the Hilbert space L2(R2).

We will see in Sect. 7.6.8 that the Euclidean propagator of a single harmonic
oscillator governs the thermodynamics of an ideal gas if we set β := 1/kT
where T is the temperature and k is the Boltzmann constant.
(vi) The generalized Feynman propagator kernel and the Maslov indices: We want
to show that analytic continuation of the Euclidean propagator kernel yields

This so-called Feynman–Souriau formula is valid for both
• all positions x, y ∈R and
• all non-critical times t ∈]tn,crit, tn+1,crit[ with n = 0, 1, 2, ...
Here, the critical times are given by tn,crit := nπ
ω . The Maslov index is deﬁned
by
μ(0, t) := n

t ∈]tn,crit, tn+1,crit[ .
(7.145)
For all t > t0, we set K(x, t; y, t0) := K(x, t −t0; y, 0). The function K is called
the generalized Feynman propagator kernel (or brieﬂy the Feynman propagator
kernel) of the quantized harmonic oscillator. The additional factors

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
appearing in (7.144) are called the critical Maslov phase factors. In terms of
mathematics, in the following proof we will show that these phase factors
are obtained in a natural way by means of analytic continuation. In terms
of physics, we will show below that the Maslov phase factors are closely related
to causality.
Proof. To simplify notation, we set ω := 1. In order to ﬁnd the analytic
continuation, we replace the real variable t by the complex variable z. This
way, using Prop. 7.41 we get
P(x, z; y, 0) =
1

Now set z := it. Then sinh z = i sin t and cosh z = cos t for all t ∈C. Suppose
that
tn,crit < t < tn+1,crit,
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
Then sin t = (−1)n| sin t|. Considering the square-root function on its Riemann
surface (see Fig. 8.6 on page 714), we obtain
√
i sin t =
p
(−1)ni| sin t| =
q
einπeiπ/2| sin t| = einπ/2eiπ/4p
| sin t|.
This yields the claim (7.144).
2
Focal points and the Morse index (Maslov index). We want to show
that the singularities of the Feynman propagator kernel K(x, t; y, t0) are related to
the Morse indices of focal points in classical mechanics. To this end, consider a
harmonic oscillator of mass m > 0 and angular frequency ω > 0 on the real line.
The classical equation of motion reads as
m¨q(τ) + ω2q(τ) = 0,
τ ∈R,
q(0) = q0,
˙q(0) = q1
with the characteristic length x0 :=
p
ℏ/mω. In Sect. 6.5.4, we have introduced
the crucial Morse (or Maslov) index which coincides with (7.145) above. Explicitly,
the critical points in time are characterized by the fact that the boundary value
problem
¨q(t) + ω2q(t) = 0,
0 < t < tn,crit,
q(0) = q(tn,crit) = 0
has not only the trivial solution q(t) ≡0, but also a nontrivial solution, namely,
q(t) := sin ωt. Observe that the function P has singularities precisely at the critical
points in time, since sin ωtn,crit = 0. Moreover, the Morse index μ(0, t) jumps at
the critical points in time.
The Feynman propagator kernel K(x, t; y, t0) of the quantized harmonic
oscillator contains information about the global behavior of the classical
harmonic oscillator.
This phenomenon is typical for the quantization of classical dynamical systems.84
Causality and the motivation of the Maslov phase factors. Using the
Dirac delta function in a formal way, we want to motivate formula (7.146) above in
terms of physics. To simplify notation, let us use the convention ω = ℏ= m := 1.
Hence x0 = 1. The starting point is the product formula (7.90) for the propagator
kernel, that is,

York, 1990.

(I) Consider the ﬁrst critical time interval 0 < t < t1,crit with t1,crit = π. Then

(II) Now consider the second critical time interval π < t < 2π. We want to
deﬁne the propagator kernel on the interval ]π, 2π[ in such a way that
lim
t→π+0 K(x, t; y, 0) =
lim
t→π−0 K(x, t; y, 0) = e−iπδ(x + y).
The appropriate deﬁnition looks like

exp

π < t < 2π.
To see this, set t := π+τ. Using sin(π+τ) = −sin τ together with limτ→0 sin τ
τ

we obtain
lim
τ→+0 K(x, π + τ; y, 0) = e−iπ/2 lim
τ→+0
e−iπ/4ei(x+y)2/2τ

critical time intervals.

The statistical physics of the multi-particle system of N harmonic os-

We want to explain the following fundamental principle in physics:
In order to pass from quantum mechanics to statistical physics, apply the

Here, we use the following notation: t time, T absolute temperature, h
Planck’s quantum of action, ℏ= h/2π, and k Boltzmann constant.
It turns out that the computation methods in statistical physics are frequently easier
to handle than the corresponding methods in quantum mechanics. The reason is
that, for T > 0 and t > 0, the integral
Z ∞

does not exist. The Euclidean trick in physics is to start with imaginary time
t = −iτ. Then it = τ is real. At the end of the computation, one performs an
analytic continuation to real time t, if possible. Fortunately enough, this trick works
well in many cases.
A gas of quantum particles on the real line. The following situation is

universal Boltzmann constant. The physical dimension of kT is energy. For studying
the physics of the gas, the following two quantities
x0 :=
r
ℏ
mω ,
βℏω = ℏω
kT
are important. Here, x0 has the physical dimension of length, and βℏω is dimen-
sionless. It is our aim to compute the following physical quantities of the gas at the
temperature T > 0.
(i) Total energy of the gas:
E = N ¯E = Nℏω

For large particle number N, the relative energy ﬂuctuations are small, as

Here, the density function ϱ(x, T) := ⟨x|ϱ(T)|x⟩is related to von Neumann’s density
operator ϱ(T). The derivative of energy with respect to temperature,
C(T) = ET (T, N),
is called the heat capacity of the gas. A small change ΔT of temperature produces
the following amount of heat,
ΔQ = C(T)ΔT.
The heat capacity can be measured in physical experiments. We will compute below
the mean energy ¯E and the mean energy ﬂuctuation Δ ¯E of one particle. For the
total energy, this yields E = N ¯E. Moreover, we assume that the single particles be-
have independently. Then, by the theory of probability, the total energy dispersion
is additive,
(ΔE)2 = (Δ ¯E)2 + ... + (Δ ¯E)2 = N(Δ ¯E)2.
Hence ΔE/E = Δ ¯E/ ¯E

Bose–Einstein condensation. To understand the physics of our gas, let us
consider the two important special cases of high temperature and low temperature.
(H) For high temperature T (i.e., β is small), we get up to terms of lower order:85
E = NkT,

The mass density function μ is a Gaussian distribution with mean ﬂuctuation
σ := x0/√βℏω. The energy law, E = N · kT, is a special case of the classical
Boltzmann law of energy equipartition. This law tells us that, for many-particle
systems at high temperature, each degree of freedom contributes the amount
of mean energy kT to the total energy of the system. For the heat capacity of
the gas, we get C = Nk.
(L) For low temperature T, we obtain:
lim
T →+0 E = 1
2ℏωN,
lim
T →+0
ΔE
E
= 0.
As expected, the particle energy is equal to the ground state energy of the har-
monic oscillator. Physicists say that the excited energy states are frozen at low
temperatures. This crucial phenomenon is called Bose-Einstein condensation.86
85 Note that sinh βℏω = βℏω+O(β2) and cosh βℏω = 1+β2ℏ2ω2+O(β4) as β →0.
86 In 2001, Eric Cornell, Wolfgang Ketterle, and Carl Wieman were awarded the
Nobel prize in physics for the experimental achievement of Bose–Einstein con-
densation in dilute gases of alkali atoms, and for fundamental studies of the
properties of the condensates.

Note that the behavior of the gas at low temperatures is governed by typical quan-
tum eﬀects.
The partition function. The possible energies of the gas particles are given
by
En = ℏω(n + 1

n = 0, 1, 2, , ...
By statistical physics, the physical properties of this many-particle system follow
from the partition function
Z(β) :=

e−βEn.
Recall that β := 1/kT. For a single particle, the probability of having the energy
En is equal to
pn := e−βEn
Z(β) .
This yields the mean energy ¯E and the mean energy ﬂuctuation Δ ¯E ≥0 of a single
particle, namely,
¯E =

(Δ ¯E)2 =

Observe now that

(ΔE)2 = E2 −¯E2.
This yields the claim (7.148) after an elementary computation.

where J is an additional small real parameter. Then Z(β, 0) = Z(β), and
¯E = ZJ(β, 0)
Z(β, 0) ,
E2 = ZJJ(β, 0)
Z(β, 0) .
Tricks of this kind frequently appear while computing path integrals in quantum
ﬁeld theory; those tricks are also closely related to the Wick theorem in quantum
ﬁeld theory published in 1950. Therefore, we will brieﬂy speak of the Wick trick.
Behind this trick, there is the following general strategy in physics which was in-
troduced by Schwinger: Add some source term to the physical system, and study

the change of the physical system under a change of the source J (see Chap. 14 of
Vol. I).
Von Neumann’s density operator. Let H : D(H) →L2(R) be the self-
adjoint Hamiltonian operator of the quantum harmonic oscillator on the real line,
H = P 2
2m + mω2Q2
2
.
Let ϕ0, ϕ1, ... be the eigensolutions of H with
Hϕn = Enϕn,
n = 0, 1, 2, ...
For any state ϕ ∈L2(R) and any temperature T > 0, deﬁne
e−βHϕ :=
∞
X
n=0
e−βEn⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩ϕn.
(7.149)
Note that
||e−βHϕ||2 =
∞
X
n=0
|e−βEn⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩|2 ≤
∞
X
n=0
|⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩|2 = ||ϕ||2.
Therefore, the operator e−βH : L2(R) →L2(R) is linear and continuous. For the
trace, we get
tr e−βH =
∞
X
n=0
⟨ϕn|e−βHϕn⟩=
∞
X
n=0
e−βEn.
This is precisely the partition function Z. Therefore, the operator e−βH is of trace
class. In order to pass to the language of physicists, denote the vector ϕn by |En⟩.
Mnemonically, we write
e−βH =
∞
X
n=0
e−βEn|En⟩⟨En|.
In fact, this implies e−βH|ϕ⟩= P∞
n=0 e−βEn|En⟩⟨En|ϕ⟩which coincides with
(7.149). If χ0, χ1, ... is an arbitrary complete orthonormal system in the Hilbert
space L2(R), then
tr e−βH =
∞
X
n=0
⟨χn|e−βHχn⟩=
∞
X
n=0
e−βEn⟨χn|En⟩⟨En|χn⟩.
The relation between the propagator P(t, 0) := e−iHt/ℏand the operator e−βH is
given by
e−βH = P (−iβℏ, 0) .
Now to the point. The linear bounded operator ϱ : L2(R) →L2(R) deﬁned by
ϱ :=
e−βH
tr e−βH
is called the density operator for our many-particle system of quantum harmonic
oscillators on the real line. Explicitly,

544
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
ϱ =
∞
X
n=0
pn|En⟩⟨En|
where pn = e−βEn/Z(β). The real numbers
ϱij := ⟨χi|ϱχj⟩,
i, j = 0, 1, 2, ...
are called the entries of the density matrix with respect to the complete orthonormal
system χ0, χ1, ... For the mean energy value ¯E and the mean energy ﬂuctuation Δ ¯E
of a particle, we get
¯E = tr(ϱH),
(ΔE)2 = tr(ϱ(H −¯E)2).
In fact, since ϱ|En⟩= pn|En⟩for all n,
tr(ϱH) =
∞
X
n=0
⟨En|ϱH|En⟩=
∞
X
n=0
pnEn⟨En|En⟩=

X
n=0
pnEn = ¯E.
A similar argument applies to Δ ¯E. Using the language of physicists, deﬁne87
ϱ(x, T) := ⟨x|e−βH|x⟩
tr e−βH
.
Since ϕn(x) = ⟨x|En⟩,
ϱ(x, T) =
X
n=0
pn⟨x|En⟩⟨En|x⟩=
∞
X
n=0
pn|ϕn(x)|2.
Recall that the function x →|ϕn(x)|2 is the particle density of the nth energy state
of the harmonic oscillator. Moreover,
Z
R
ϱ(x, T)dx =
∞
X
n=0
pn = 1.
Therefore, it is reasonable to regard ϱ(x, T) as the (normalized) particle density of
the gas at the point x at the temperature T.
Semiclassical quantum statistics and the Dirac calculus (formal ap-
proach). We want to explain how the Dirac calculus allows us to formally pass
from the density operator ϱ to the semiclassical Gibbs statistics for high tempera-
tures. Let A : L2(R) →L2(R) be a linear continuous operator of trace class. For a
complete orthonormal system χ0, χ1, ... of the complex Hilbert space L2(R), we get
tr A =
∞
X
n=0
⟨χn|Aχn⟩.
(7.150)
The point is that this number is ﬁnite, and it does not depend on the choice of the
complete orthonormal system χ0, χ1, ... The trick of the Dirac calculus is to formally
extend the trace formula (7.150) to complete orthonormal systems of generalized
eigenfunctions. For example, using the system {⟨x|}x∈R, we get
87 See the formal Dirac calculus on page 596 of Vol. I.

7.6 Von Neumann’s Rigorous Approach
545
tr A =
Z
R
⟨x|A|x⟩dx.
(7.151)
Applying this formal approach, we are going to show that for high temperatures T,
we obtain the following approximative formulas.88
(i) Mean value of energy:
¯E =
Z
R2 H(x, p)ϱ(x, p; T)dxdp
h
.
(ii) Mean energy ﬂuctuation: (Δ ¯E)2 =
R
R2(H(x, p) −¯E)2ϱ(x, p; T) dxdp
h .
Here, H(x, p) :=
p2
2m + mω2x2
2
. For the density function in the phase space,
ϱ(x, p; T) :=
e−βH(x,p)
R
R2 e−βH(x,p) dxdp
h
.
(7.152)
For a given function A = A(x, p), the mean value ¯A is deﬁned by
¯A =
Z
R2 A(x, p)ϱ(x, p; T)dxdp
h
.
If the function A = A(x) only depends on the position variable x, then
¯A =
Z
R
A(x)ϱ(x, T)dx
where we deﬁne
ϱ(x, T) :=
Z
R
ϱ(x, p; T)dp
h .
Let us prove (i) and (ii) above in a formal way. To begin with, observe that
⟨x|P 2|p⟩= p2⟨x|p⟩and
⟨x|Q2|p⟩= ⟨Q2x|p⟩= x2⟨x|p⟩.
Hence
⟨x|H|p⟩= ⟨x| P 2
2m + mω2Q2
2
|p⟩= H(x, p)⟨x|p⟩.
Up to terms of order O(β2) as β →0, we get
⟨x|e−βH|p⟩= ⟨x| (I −βH) |p⟩.
Hence
⟨x|e−βH|p⟩= (1 −βH(x, p)) ⟨x|p⟩= e−βH(x,p)⟨x|p⟩.
For the trace, we obtain tr e−βH =
R
R⟨x|e−βH|x⟩dx. Using Dirac’s completeness
relation
R
R |p⟩⟨p| dp = I, we obtain
tr e−βH =
Z
R2⟨x|e−βH|p⟩⟨p|x⟩dxdp.
88 Note that dxdp/h and ϱ(x, p; T) are dimensionless.

546
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Since ⟨x|p⟩= eipx/
√
h and ⟨p|x⟩= ⟨x|p⟩†, we get
tr e−βH =
Z
R2 e−βH(x,p) dxdp
h
.
Summarizing, from ϱ = e−βH/ tr e−βH it follows that
⟨x|ϱ|p⟩= ϱ(x, p; T)⟨x|p⟩
where ϱ(x, p; T) is deﬁned by (7.152). Finally,
¯E = tr(ϱH) =
Z
R
⟨x|ϱH|x⟩dx =
Z
R2⟨x|ϱ|p⟩⟨p|H|x⟩dxdp.
Hence ¯E =
R
R2 ϱ(x, p; T)H(x, p) dxdp
h . Similarly, we argue for Δ ¯E.

X
n=0
e−βEn|⟨x|En⟩|2,

write this as

e−βEn|ϕn(x)|2dx.
(7.153)
Proposition 7.42 The trace formula (7.153) holds. Explicitly, the trace tr e−βH is
the partition function of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
Proof. The trace class operator e−βH has the complete orthonormal system of
eigenvectors ϕ0, ϕ1, ... with e−βHϕn = e−βEnϕn for all n. The trace is the sum of
the eigenvalues. Hence
tr e−βH =

n=0
e−βEn.
On the other hand, it follows from ||ϕn||2 =

Recall that β := 1/kT and x0 :=

Folklore
7.7.1 The Basic Strategy
In Chap. 7 of Vol. I, we studied discrete path integrals in a rigorous setting for N
degrees of freedom. In this section, we will study the limit N →∞. Our plan is the
following one:

548
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
(i) We start with the deﬁnition of the Feynman path integral (7.156) below as a
limit in position space, where N →∞.
(ii) We rigorously show that this limit exists (in a generalized sense) in the two
special cases of
• the free quantum particle on the real line (Sect. 7.7.3) and
• the harmonic oscillator (Sect. 7.7.4).
It turns out that these limits coincide with the propagator kernel introduced in
Sects. 7.6.4 and 7.6.7 by using the rigorous method of Fourier analysis combined
with analytic continuation.
(iii) This brings us to the formulation of the propagator hypothesis saying that the
Feynman path integral always represents the Feynman propagator kernel of
the Schr¨odinger equation. We motivate this propagator hypothesis by using
the Dirac calculus in a formal sense (Sect. 7.7.6).
(iv) In Sect. 7.8, we will rigorously study ﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals
with N degrees of freedom. Motivated by this, in Sect. 7.9 we will give the
deﬁnition of normalized inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals by using the
spectral theory of quadratic forms and the determinant of inﬁnite-dimensional
operators based on the analytic continuation of the corresponding zeta function.
(v) For the free quantum particle and the harmonic oscillator, we rigorously show
that the normalized inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integral represents the Feyn-
man propagator kernel, up to a normalization factor (Sects. 7.9.3 and 7.9.4).
(vi) This brings us to the spectral hypothesis saying that the Feynman path integral
can be computed by means of inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals, up to a
normalization factor. This is the basic method successfully used by physicists
in quantum ﬁeld theory. Fortunately enough, the normalization factor does
not play any role, as a rule, since it drops out by considering quotients of path
integrals.
The following remarks are in order:
• The concrete calculations performed by physicists show that the propagator hy-
pothesis above is right in quantum mechanics.89 Many concrete examples can be
found in the following two standard references:
C. Grosche and F. Steiner, Handbook of Feynman Path Integrals, Springer,
Berlin, 1998 (950 references).
H. Kleinert, Path Integrals in Quantum Mechanics, Statistics, and Polymer
Physics, World Scientiﬁc, River Edge, New York, 2004.
• In Sect. 7.11, we will study the rigorous Wiener path integral for Brownian motion
together with Cameron’s no-go theorem for the Feynman path integral.
• In Sect. 7.12, we will investigate the relation between the Weyl calculus and the
Feynman path integral (method of pseudo-diﬀerential operators).
Detailed hints to both the mathematical and physical literature concerning the
Feynman path integral can be found in Sect. 7.22 on page 667.
The creation of a comprehensive rigorous mathematical theory for Feyn-
man path integrals (also called functional integrals) in quantum ﬁeld theory
is a challenge for the mathematics of the future.
89 However, observe the following peculiarity: If caustics appear in classical mechan-
ics, then one has to handle carefully the Maslov indices in quantum mechanics,
as in the case of the harmonic oscillator in Sect. 7.6.7.

7.7.2 The Basic Deﬁnition
Let us consider the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t) + U(x)ψ(x, t),
x ∈R, t > s
(7.154)

dτ.
(7.155)
We assume that the potential U : R →R is smooth. Choose N = 1, 2, . . . , and divide
the time interval [s, t] into the subintervals t0 = s < t1 < . . . < tN−1 < tN = t,
where
tj := s + jΔt,
j = 0, 1, . . . , N,
Δt := t −s
N
.
Fix the positions x, y ∈R on the real line. Let the symbol C{s, t} denote the set of
all continuous functions q : [s, t] →R with the boundary condition
q(s) := x,
q(t) := y.
For each path q ∈C{s, t}, we set qj := q(tj), where j = 0, 1, . . . , N. By deﬁnition,
the discrete action of this path reads as
SN :=
N−1

Finally, let us introduce the characteristic length l :=

2πℏiΔt

. Here, the square
root is to be understood in the sense of the principal value.
Basic deﬁnition. Our deﬁnition of the Feynman path integral reads as

eiS[q]/ℏDq := lim
N→∞

(7.156)
Since the boundary values q0 = y and qN = x are ﬁxed, the integrals on the
right-hand side of (7.156) are well-deﬁned (N −1)-dimensional integrals of the real
variables q1, . . . , qN−1. We assume that the limit N →∞exists.
Intuitive interpretation. We regard
R
C{s,t} eiS[q]/ℏDq as an integral over the
paths in the space C{s, t}. The deﬁnition (7.156) will be motivated in great detail
in Sect. 7.7.6 on page 555. The path integral depends on x, t, y, s. We write
K(x, t; y, s) =
Z
C{s,t}
eiS[q]/ℏDq.
In the following two sections, we will show that, for the free quantum particle and
the harmonic oscillator on the real line, the function K is nothing else than the
Feynman propagator kernel K.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
7.7.3 Application to the Free Quantum Particle
Let us consider the Schr¨odinger equation (7.154) above with vanishing potential,
U(x) ≡0. The corresponding classical action reads as
S[q] :=
Z t

2m ˙q(τ)2dτ.
In Sect. 7.5.1, we have computed the corresponding Feynman propagator kernel

2πℏi(t −s) eim(x−y)2/2ℏ(t−s)
(7.157)
for a freely moving quantum particle on the real line (see Theorem 7.16 on page
488).
Proposition 7.44 For the free quantum particle, the Feynman path integral coin-
cides with the Feynman propagator kernel, that is, we have
K(x, t; y, s) =
Z
C{s,t}
eiS[q]/ℏDq
(7.158)
for all positions x, y ∈R and all times t > s.
In the following proof, we will use a slight modiﬁcation (7.160) of the original
deﬁnition (7.156) of the path integral. In terms of physics, we separate the classical
contribution from the quantum ﬂuctuations. In terms of mathematics, we pass to
homogeneous boundary conditions.
Proof. To simplify notation, set ℏ:= 1 and s := 0.
(I) The classical trajectory. The action of a classical free particle of mass m on
the real line is given by
S[q] :=
Z t
0
1
2m ˙q(τ)2 dτ.
Recall that the boundary-value problem
m¨q(τ) = 0,
0 < τ < t,
q(0) = y, q(t) = x
corresponds to the motion of the particle with given endpoints. The unique solution
is qclass(τ) = y + τ
t (x −y) with the classical action
S[qclass] =
Z t
0

2m ˙qclass(τ)2dτ = m(x −y)2
2t
.
(II) Decomposition of trajectories. In order to study perturbations of the clas-
sical trajectory, we consider the trajectories
q(τ) = qclass(τ) + r(τ),
τ ∈[0, t]
where r ∈C2
0[0, t], that is, the function r : [0, t] →R is twice continuously diﬀeren-
tiable and satisﬁes the boundary condition r(0) = r(t) = 0. Then
S[q] = S[qclass] + S[r].

In fact, integration by parts yields

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
7.7.4 Application to the Harmonic Oscillator
The path integral for the harmonic oscillator is closely related to the dif-
ference method for the classical harmonic oscillator in numerical analysis.
Folklore
Consider the Schr¨odinger equation (7.154) above for the harmonic oscillator with
mass m and angular frequency ω > 0. This corresponds to the potential U(x) =
mω2
2 x2. The classical action is given by
S[q] =
Z t
s
1
2m ˙q(τ)2 −1
2mω2q(τ)2 dτ.
(7.162)
In Sect. 7.6.7 on page 537, we have computed the corresponding Feynman propa-
gator kernel
K(x, t; y, s) =
1
x0
p
2πi sin ω(t −s)
exp
„
i(x2 + y2) cos ω(t −s) −2xy

«
for the harmonic oscillator. Here, we restrict ourselves to the ﬁrst critical time
interval s < t < s + t1,crit, where t1,crit = π
ω . Furthermore, x0 =
q
ℏ
mω .
Proposition 7.45 For the quantized harmonic oscillator, the Feynman path inte-
gral coincides with the Feynman propagator kernel on the ﬁrst critical time interval,
that is, for all positions x, y ∈R, and all times t ∈]s, s + t1,crit[, we have
K(x, t; y, s) =
Z
C{s,t}
eiS[q]/ℏDq.
(7.163)
This proposition is to be understood in a generalized sense which will be made
precise in the following proof. First the Gaussian integrals have to be understood in
a generalized sense by using analytic continuation. Secondly the limit N →∞from
(7.156) does not exist in the classical sense. Therefore, we will use a summation
method.
Proof. (I) The classical trajectory. The boundary-value problem
¨q(τ) + ω2q(τ) = 0,
s < τ < t,
q(s) = y, q(t) = x
(7.164)
has the unique solution qclass(τ) = y cos ω(τ −s) +
`
x −y cos ω(τ −s)
´ sin ω(τ−s)
sin ω(t−s) .
This is a trajectory of the classical harmonic oscillator with the action
S[qclass] = ℏ· (x2 + y2) cos ω(t −s) −2xy
2x2
0 sin ω(t −s))
.
(II) Decomposition of trajectories. Now we consider perturbations of the clas-
sical trajectory, by setting
q(τ) := qclass(τ) + r(τ)
where r ∈C2
0[s, t]. By deﬁnition, this notation means that the function r : [s, t] →R
is twice continuously diﬀerentiable and satisﬁes the following boundary condition
r(s) = r(t) = 0. We have
S[q] = S[qclass] + S[r]
for all
r ∈C2
0[s, t].
(7.165)

In fact, integration by parts yields

Z t

(¨qclass + ω2qclass)r dτ = 0,
since qclass satisﬁes the classical equation of motion (7.164). Motivated by (7.165),
let us slightly modify the deﬁnition (7.156) of the path integral by setting

for all n = 1, 2, . . . , N −1. Letting Δt →0, we obtain the ordinary diﬀerential

0 < τ < t
with the initial condition a(0) = 0 and ˙a(0) = 1.90 This initial-value problem has

The proof of Prop. 7.45 shows that the computation of the Feynman path
integral for the harmonic oscillator is closely related to the eigenvalues of the cor-
responding classical boundary-value problem. Indeed, this is a crucial method for
computing Feynman path integrals. We will study this in Sect. 7.9 on page 570
by means of the zeta-function regularization for inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian in-
tegrals.

7.7 The Feynman Path Integral
555
7.7.5 The Propagator Hypothesis
Motivated by Props. 7.44 and 7.45, let us formulate the following so-called propa-
gator hypothesis:
(H) For the Schr¨odinger equation (7.154) on the real line, the Feynman
propagator kernel is given by the Feynman path integral, that is,
K(x, t; y, s) =
Z
C{s,t}
eimS[q]/ℏDq.
Here, S[q] is the classical action given by (7.155) on page 549.
7.7.6 Motivation of Feynman’s Path Integral
It is our goal to motivate the propagator hypothesis (H) by using the formal Dirac
calculus.
The classical Liouville measure in phase space. Consider a gas on the real
line at high temperature T > 0. Let x and p denote the position and the momentum
of a gas particle, respectively. In semi-classical statistical physics, the mean value
¯A of a physical quantity A = A(x, p) is given by
¯A =
Z
R
A(x, p)ϱ(x, p; T)dμ(x, p).
Here, ϱ = ϱ(x, p; T) denotes the density function from (7.152) on page 545. Further-
more, dμ := dxdp/h denotes the Liouville measure. This means that the Liouville
measure μ(Ω) of a compact subset Ω of the (x, p)-phase space is given by
μ(Ω) =
Z
Ω
dμ =
Z
Ω
dxdp
h
.
If the function A = A(x) does not depend on the momentum, then we separately
integrate with respect to the variable p. This yields
¯A =
Z
R
A(x)ϱ(x; T)dx
with ϱ(x, T) :=
R
R ϱ(x, p; T) dp
h . Note that the appearance of the Planck constant h
as denominator guarantees that the Liouville measure dxdp/h is dimensionless. We
now want to show that the formal Feynman path integral is nothing else than an in-
tegral with respect to a formal inﬁnite-dimensional Liouville measure. Alternatively,
the Feynman path integral can also be viewed as a modiﬁed inﬁnite-dimensional
Gaussian integral.
The path integral in the phase space. Consider the motion x = q(t) of a
classical particle with mass m on the real line. For the momentum, p(t) = m ˙q(t).
The Hamiltonian function reads as
H(q, p) := p2
2m + U(q),
q, p ∈R
with the potential U. The action along a trajectory during the time interval [s, t] is
given by

556
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
S[q, p] :=
Z t
s
p(τ)2
2m
−U(q(τ)) dτ.
(7.169)
Here, p(τ)2/2m is the kinetic energy and U(q(τ)) is the potential energy of the
classical particle at time τ. Equivalently,
S[q, p] :=
Z t
s
p(τ) ˙q(τ) −H(q(τ), p(τ)) dτ.
We now pass to the Schr¨odinger equation for the corresponding quantum particle
on the real line,
iℏψt(x, t) = Hψ(x, t),
(7.170)
with the Hamiltonian operator H =
P 2
2m + U(Q). Recall from (7.88) on page 491
that the initial-value problem for the Schr¨odinger equation (7.170) has the solution
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
K(x, t; y, s)ψ0(y)dy,
t > s, x ∈R
with ψ(x, s) = ψ0(x) for all positions x ∈R at the initial time s. The kernel K has
the physical dimension of [length]−1. In the elegant formal language of the Dirac
calculus,
K(x, t; y, s) = ⟨x|e−iH(t−s)/ℏ|y⟩.
Our goal is to motivate Feynman’s magic formula
K(x, t; y, s) =
Z
C{s,t}
eiS[q,p]/ℏDqDp,
(7.171)
which tells us that the propagator kernel K can be represented by a path integral.
Here, we integrate over the space C{s, t} of all continuous paths q, p : [s, t] →R
with
q(s) = y,
q(t) = x.
That is, we ﬁx the initial time s, the initial point y, the ﬁnal time t, and the
ﬁnal point x. Note that both the initial value p(s) and the ﬁnal value p(t) of the
momentum variable are unconstrained. Moreover, we use the classical action
S[q, p] :=
Z t
s
p(τ) ˙q(τ) −H(q(τ), p(τ)) dτ
along the path q = q(τ), p = p(τ), s ≤τ ≤t. The symbol D[q, p] represents a
formal inﬁnite-dimensional Liouville measure on the space C[s, t] of curves in the
phase space. Formally,
D[q, p] := dp(s)
h
Y
s<τ≤t
dq(τ)dp(τ)
h
.
Since dq(τ)dp(τ)/h is dimensionless, both the measure D[q, p] and the kernel from
(7.171) have the same physical dimension of [length]−1, as expected. The motivation
given below will show that the magic formula (7.171) stands for the following formal
limit

Here, q0 := y and qN := x.
Applying the Dirac calculus. We want to motivate formula (7.172). To
simplify notation, set ℏ= 1. Then h = 2π. Let us decompose the time interval [s, t]
into N pieces of equal length by setting
s = t0 < t1 < ... < tN−1 < tN = t
along with tn := s+nΔt and Δt := (t−s)/N. Recall the propagator kernel formula:
K(x, t; y, s) := ⟨x|e−iNHΔt|y⟩.
(i) Causality and the product property of the propagator kernel: For all interme-
diate times τ with s ≤τ ≤t, we get the following product formula
K(x, t; y, s) =
Z
R
K(x, t; q, τ)K(q, τ; y, s)dq.
(7.173)
In fact, by the addition theorem for the exponential function,
e−iH(t−s) = e−iH(t−τ)e−iH(τ−s).
Using the completeness relation
R
R |q⟩⟨q| dq = I, we obtain
⟨x|e−iH(t−s)|y⟩=
Z
R
⟨x|e−iH(t−τ)|q⟩⟨q|e−iH(τ−s)|y⟩dq
which proves (7.173). From the physical point of view, the product formula
(7.173) reﬂects nothing other than causality (see page 482).
(ii) The propagator kernel for small time intervals: We want to show that the
propagator kernel K for the small time interval [s, s+Δt] can be approximately
represented by the following simple key formula
K(x, s + Δt; y, s) =
Z
R
e−iH(y,p)Δt eip(x−y) dp
2π ,
(7.174)
up to terms of order (Δt)2. To get this, note that the following is true, up to
terms of order (Δt)2. By Taylor expansion,
e−iHΔt = I −iHΔt.
Recall that H = P 2
2m + mω2Q2
2
. For the position operator, Q|y⟩= y|y⟩. Hence,
by the completeness relation
R
R |p⟩⟨p| dp = I, we get
⟨x|Q2|y⟩= y2⟨x|y⟩= y2

⟨x|p⟩⟨p|y⟩dp.

⟨x|Q2|y⟩=

up to terms of order (Δt)2. This ﬁnishes the formal proof of the claim.
(iii) The path integral: Consider ﬁrst the case where N = 2. Set q0 := y and
q2 := x. By the product formula (7.173),
K(q2, t2; q0, t0) =
Z
R
K(q2, t2; q1, t1)K(q1, t1; q0, t0)dq1.

7.8 Finite-Dimensional Gaussian Integrals

probability theory represents the prototype of the formal theory of inﬁnite-
dimensional Gaussian integrals, which play a crucial role for describing
correlations in quantum ﬁeld theory.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
In order to understand the formal properties of inﬁnite-dimensional Gaus-
sian integrals, write the well-deﬁned N-dimensional Gaussian integrals in
such a way that the formal limit N →∞can be easily performed.
Folklore
Path integrals (or more general functional integrals) can be computed by regarding
them as inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals. To discuss this, in the present
section we are going to study ﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals. In the next
section, we will generalize this to the inﬁnite-dimensional case. Note that
• free systems (i.e., systems without any interaction) correspond to standard Gaus-
sian integrals, whereas
• interacting systems are described by the perturbation of standard Gaussian in-
tegrals.
In the framework of perturbation theory, the computation of perturbed Gaussian
integrals can be reduced to the computation of moments for standard Gaussian
integrals. Analytically, this can be based on the Wick theorem. Graphically, this
corresponds to Feynman diagrams.

This Fresnel integral exists in the classical sense.91 In the special case where
ℜ(a) > 0 and b ∈C, relation (7.183) is always valid in the classical sense (i.e.,
the integral exists).92

In the special case where a = 1, this relation shows that the Gaussian function
x →e−x2/2 is a ﬁxed point of the Fourier transform.
(v) The method of stationary phase: Let us introduce the so-called phase function
Φ(x) := −1
2ax2 + bx. The equation
Φ′(x) = −ax + b = 0
has the unique solution xcrit := b/a. For this point, the phase function Φ
becomes stationary. Relation (7.183) can be written as

(a, b) ∈Ω.
This so-called method of stationary phase tells us that the integral is deter-
mined by the integrand at the stationary point xcrit, up to a normalization
constant.
(vi) Adiabatic regularization: Let f : R →C be a bounded function, that is,
supx∈R |f(x)| < ∞, which is continuous (or continuous up to a set of Lebesgue
measure zero). Then the integral

exists, which is called the adiabatic regularization of the integral

For example, let α ∈R, b ∈C, and let ε > 0. Then the integral

Note that if ℜ(a) > 0, then the integrals M0, M1, M2, . . . exist, and the Wick

The integrals are to be understood in the generalized sense. However, if ℜ(λk) > 0

in the classical sense. We make the following assumption.
(H) All the eigenvalues of the real symmetric (N×N)-matrix A = (akl) are positive,
that is, λ1 > 0, . . . , λN > 0.

= ⟨x|Ax⟩−2⟨Ay|x⟩+ ⟨Ay|y⟩.
Finally, set b := Ay. By (i), the integral on the left-hand side of (7.188) is equal

7.8.2 Free Moments, the Wick Theorem, and Feynman Diagrams
In what follows, we will use a terminology which ﬁts best the needs of quantum
ﬁeld theory. Our approach can be viewed as a discrete variant of quantum ﬁeld
theory. The basic notions are:
• free probability distribution (also called the Gaussian distribution in mathemat-
ics),
• free moments (free n-correlation functions or, brieﬂy, called free n-point func-
tions),
• generating function of the free moments,
• Feynman diagrams (i.e., graphic representation of free moments).
In the next section, we will generalize this to full probability distributions and full
moments.

7.8 Finite-Dimensional Gaussian Integrals
565
In terms of discrete quantum ﬁeld theory, full moments (resp. free mo-
ments) describe particles under interaction (resp. free particles without any
interaction).
Moments are fundamental quantities. The theory of moments in probability theory
tells us that, roughly speaking, a probability distribution is uniquely determined
by the knowledge of its moments (see Vol. I, page 751). Our main task is to reduce
the computation of full moments to the computation of free moments. This is the
basic trick of perturbation theory in quantum ﬁeld theory.
The free probability distribution. Assume that the matrix A has the prop-
erty (H) formulated on page 562. Introduce the key quantity
ϱ(x) :=
e−1
2 ⟨x|Ax⟩
R
RN e−1
2 ⟨x|Ax⟩dx1 · · · dxN
,
x ∈RN.
This is called the free probability density. The function F : RN →R given by
F(x) :=
Z x
−∞
ϱ(y)dy
is called the free probability distribution (or Gaussian distribution).
Free Moments. Choose the indices k1, k2, . . . , kn = 1, 2, . . ., and ﬁx the posi-
tive integer n = 1, 2, . . . Deﬁne
⟨xk1xk2 · · · xkn⟩:=
Z
RN xk1xk2 · · · xkn · ϱ(x)dx1 · · · dxN.
These expectation values are called the moments of the probability density ϱ (or,
brieﬂy, the free moments). We also use the notation93
Cn,free(xk1, xk2, . . . , xkn) := ⟨xk1xk2 · · · xkn⟩,
and we call Cn,free a free discrete n-correlation function (or a free n-point function).
Explicitly, we get94

The trick of the generating function. For all J ∈RN, introduce the so-
called generating function
Zfree(J) :=
Z
RN ϱ(x)e⟨J|x⟩dx1 · · · dxN.
Explicitly, we get
93 The value Cn,free(xk1, xk2, . . . , xkn) only depends on the indices k1, k2, . . . , kn.
However, mnemonically, our notation is convenient for the passage to quantum
ﬁeld theory. Then we can use the same notation for the continuously varying
variables xk1, xk2, . . . , xkn.
94 We introduce the rescaled diﬀerential
dxk
√
2π in order to prepare the limit N →∞
to path integrals (inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integrals) later on.

1
2 ⟨J|A−1J⟩,
(7.191)
by setting J = 0 after diﬀerentiation. In particular, for the free 2-point function we
get
⟨xkxl⟩= (A−1)kl,
k, l = 1, . . . , N
where (A−1)kl is the entry of the inverse matrix A−1 located in the kth row and in
the lth column.
Theorem 7.46 Let k1, . . . , kn = 1, 2, . . . N. If n is even, then
⟨xk1xk2 · · · xkn⟩=
X
⟨xi1xi2⟩⟨xi3xi4⟩· · · ⟨xin−1xin⟩.
Here, we sum over all possible pairings of the indices k1, k2, . . . , kn. If n is odd, then
⟨xk1xk2 · · · xkn⟩= 0.
This so-called Wick theorem tells us that the Gaussian distribution has the
following important property: the 2-point function determines all the other n-point
functions.
Proof. Observe that the function J →⟨J|A−1J⟩is quadratic. If n is even, then
use (7.191) together with the chain rule. If n is odd, then note that the function
(x1, x2, x3) →x1x2x3 is odd, and so on.

Feynman diagrams. For example, the Wick theorem tells us that
⟨x1x2x3x4⟩= ⟨x1 x2 x3 x4⟩+ ⟨x1x2 x3x4 ⟩+ ⟨x1 x2 x3 x4⟩.
(7.192)
That is, we sum over all possible fully contracted symbols. Explicitly, this means
⟨x1x2x3x4⟩= ⟨x1x2⟩⟨x3x4⟩+ ⟨x1x3⟩⟨x2x4⟩+ ⟨x1x4⟩⟨x2x3⟩.
This is graphically represented in Table 7.1(c) by using so-called Feynman diagrams.
Here, the contractions correspond to connections of the vertices. Similarly, we get
⟨x1x1x3x4⟩= ⟨x1 x1 x3 x4⟩+ ⟨x1x1 x3x4 ⟩+ ⟨x1 x1 x3 x4⟩.
(7.193)
This is graphically represented in Table 7.1(d). Naturally enough, the diagram
corresponding to ⟨x1x1⟩is called a loop. Analogously,
⟨x4
1x2
2⟩= 3⟨x2

7.8.3 Full Moments and Perturbation Theory
Distinguish strictly between free moments and full moments.
Folklore
Now we pass to probability distributions which are perturbations of Gaussian dis-
tributions. The strength of perturbation is measured by the coupling constant κ.
This way, free moments (resp. free n-point functions) are replaced by full moments
(resp. full n-point functions).
The full probability distribution under interaction. Assume that the
matrix A has the property (H) formulated on page 562. Let
U : RN →R
be a polynomial with respect to the real variables x1, . . . , xN (e.g., we choose
U(x) := −⟨x|x⟩2). We are given the real nonnegative number κ called coupling
constant. Introduce
ϱκ(x) :=
e−1

R
RN e−1
2 ⟨x|Ax⟩eκU(x)dx1 · · · dxN

x ∈RN.
(7.195)
This is called the full probability density, which depends on the coupling constant
κ. The function Fκ : RN →R given by

568
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Fκ(x) :=
Z x
−∞
ϱκ(y)dy,
x ∈RN
is called the full probability distribution (or perturbed Gaussian distribution). The
function κU measures the strength of the perturbation. As a rule, we will consider
the case where the coupling constant κ is small. We assume that the function ϱκ is
well deﬁned, that is, the denominator of ϱκ in (7.195) is a ﬁnite integral. Note that
the free probability density corresponds to the case where the coupling constant
vanishes, κ = 0. Deﬁne
⟨xk1xk2 · · · xkn⟩full :=
Z
RN xk1xk2 · · · xkn · ϱκ(x)dx1 · · · dxN.
These expectation values are called the full moments. We also use the notation
Cn,full(xk1, xk2, . . . , xkn) := ⟨xk1xk2 · · · xkn⟩full,
and we call Cn,full a full discrete n-correlation function (or a full n-point function).

Here, the dots stand for terms of order O(κ2) as κ →0. Since U(x) is a polyno-
mial with respect to x1, . . . , xn, the right-hand side only contains free moments.
Therefore the Wick theorem tells us that
The computation of full moments can be reduced to the computation of the
special free moments ⟨xixj⟩.
This is the secret behind the success of perturbation theory in quantum ﬁeld theory.
For example, let N ≥2. Choose U(x) := x4
1. Then ⟨U(x)⟩= 3⟨x2

get

The reduced full moments (cumulants). In order to avoid redundant ex-
pressions, let us introduce the reduced full generating function
Zfull,red(J) := ln Zfull(J).
Then
Zfull(J) = eZfull,red(J).
(7.197)
By deﬁnition, Zfull,red is the generating function for the so-called reduced full mo-
ments:95
⟨xk1xk2 . . . xkn⟩full,red :=
∂nZfull,red(0)
∂Jk1∂Jk2 · · · ∂Jkn

Using Taylor expansion with respect to κ, it follows from (7.197) that
The full moments can be uniquely computed by means of the reduced full
moments.
95 In mathematics, reduced moments are also called cumulants.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
In the special free case where κ = 0, we obtain
Zfree,red(J) = ln Zfree(J) = ln e
1
2 ⟨J|A−1J⟩= 1
2⟨J|A−1J⟩.
Hence
⟨xkxl⟩free red = ⟨xkxl⟩,
k, l = 1, . . . , N.
The remaining reduced free moments are equal to zero. This implies the following
result.
The reduced full generating function satisﬁes the relation
Zfull,red(J) = Zfree,red(J) + O(κ) = 1 +
N
X
i,k=1
1
2⟨xixk⟩JiJk + O(κ)
as κ →0. Therefore, the function Zfull,red describes the perturbation of the second
free moments, under the inﬂuence of the coupling constant κ. In contrast to this,
the formula
Zfull(J) = Zfree(J) + O(κ),
κ →0
is full of redundance, since the function Zfree is redundant compared with Zfree,red.
This is why physicists use reduced full correlation (or n-point) functions in quantum
ﬁeld theory.

7.9.1 The Inﬁnite-Dimensional Dispersion Operator
We want to generalize the preceding formulas. To this end, we are given the linear
symmetric operator
A : D(A) →X
deﬁned on the linear dense subspace D(A) of the real inﬁnite-dimensional separable
Hilbert space X. Assume that we have the eigenvector equation
Aϕk = λkϕk,
k = 1, 2, . . .
where λk > 0 for all k, and the eigenvectors ϕ1, ϕ2 . . . form a complete orthonormal
system of the Hilbert space X (together with ϕk ∈D(A) for all k). Then we obtain
b = P∞
k=1⟨b|ϕk⟩ϕk for all b ∈X, and
Aϕ =
∞
X
k=1
λk⟨ϕ|ϕk⟩ϕk
for all
ϕ ∈D(A).
This implies ⟨ϕ|Aϕ⟩= P∞
k=1 λk⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩2. If Aϕ = 0, then ϕ = 0. Thus the operator
A is injective, and the inverse operator A−1 : D(A−1) →X exists with
A−1ϕk = λ−1
k ϕk,
k = 1, 2, . . .
In particular, we get D(A−1) ⊆D(A), and
⟨b|A−1b⟩=
∞
X
k=1
λ−1
k ⟨b|ϕk⟩2
for all
b ∈D(A).
Furthermore, for the dispersion operator A, we deﬁne
• the trace tr A := P∞
k=1 λk,
• the determinant det A := Q∞
k=1 λk, and
• the zeta function ζA(s) = P∞
k=1 λ−s
k
for suitable complex numbers s.
If the trace is ﬁnite, that is tr(A) < ∞, then
det A = etr A.
In what follows, we are given b ∈D(A). We have to distinguish the following two
cases.
(C1) Regular case: 0 < det A < ∞(the determinant exists).
(C2) Singular case: det A = ∞(the determinant does not exist in the usual sense).
Regular case. Here, we deﬁne the normalized inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian
integral by setting

Observe that in concrete situations, the domain of deﬁnition D(A) of the operator A
describes boundary conditions. Changing the boundary conditions means changing
the operator A and its eigenvalues. Since the determinant det A depends on the
eigenvalues, the integral depends on the domain of deﬁnition D(A). Now let us
study the singular case which is typically encountered in quantum physics.

Determinants
The deﬁnition ln det A := −ζ′
A(0) was ﬁrst used by the mathemati-
cians Ray and Singer (1971), when they tried to give a deﬁnition of the
Reidemeister–Franz torsion in analytic terms. . . Later zeta function regu-
larization was used by physicists in the context of dimensional regulariza-
tion when applied to quantum ﬁeld theory in curved space-time.96
Klaus Kirsten, 2002
It is our goal to use (7.198) and to redeﬁne the determinant det A by means of the
zeta function ζA together with analytic continuation.
Singular case. Motivated by (7.187), the key formula reads as
det A = e−ζ′
A(0).
(7.199)
Let us assume the following:
(H) The zeta function ζA(s) = P∞
n=1 λ−s

converges for all suﬃciently
large positive real numbers s, and it can be analytically continued to some
neighborhood of the point s = 0 in the complex plane.
Here, we deﬁne the determinant det A of the operator A by (7.199). This gener-
ates the deﬁnition of the normalized inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integral in the
singular case:

to motivate (7.201), observe ﬁrst that the following hold.
Proposition 7.48 Let γ > 0. Assume that the hypothesis (H) above is valid. Then
det(γA) = γζA(0) det A.

This generalizes the classical relation det(γA) = γN det A which is valid in
the N-dimensional Euclidean space with N = 1, 2, . . . The proof will be given in
Problem 7.34 by using Euler’s gamma function. Replacing A by γA it follows from
(7.200) that

This yields (7.201) if γ > 0. For general complex numbers γ (outside the negative
real axis), the right-hand side of (7.201) makes sense after analytic continuation.
The quotient trick. Fortunately enough, in quantum ﬁeld theory one fre-
quently encounters quotients of Gaussian integrals which dramatically simpliﬁes
the approach. To illustrate this, note that, in the regular case, it follows from
(7.198) that

(7.202)
This expression is independent of the determinant det A. Therefore, we use this as
a deﬁnition for all dispersion operators A and all b ∈D(A). This way, the use of
the critical determinant det A is completely avoided.
Example. Let m > 0. The following example will be used below in order to
study the free quantum particle on the real line. Consider the quadratic form
S[r] := 1
2m⟨r|Ar⟩,
r ∈D(A)
with the linear diﬀerential operator A : D(A) →X given by
Ar := −d2r
dτ 2 ,
r ∈D(A).
Here, X is the real Hilbert space L2(R), and the domain of deﬁnition D(A) consists
of all twice continuously diﬀerentiable functions r : [s, t] →R with r(s) = r(t) = 0.
We write C2
0[s, t] instead of D(A). Integration by parts yields

7.9.3 Application to the Free Quantum Particle
Consider the motion of a free quantum particle on the real line. In Theorem 7.16
on page 488, we have computed the corresponding Feynman propagator kernel
K(x, t; y, s) =
r
m
2πℏi(t −s) eim(x−y)2/2ℏ(t−s)
(7.203)
for all positions x, y ∈R and all times t > s.97 In addition, we have shown that the
dynamics of the free quantum particle is governed by the formula
ψ(x, t) :=
Z
R
K(x, t; y, s)ψ(y, s) dy,
x ∈R, t > s.
(7.204)
If we know the Schr¨odinger wave function ψ of the free particle at time s, then the
kernel formula (7.204) tells us how to obtain the wave function at the later time t.
This explains the importance of the Feynman propagator kernel. In Prop. 7.44 on
page 550, we have proved that
K(x, t; y, s) =
Z
C{s,t}
eiS[q]/ℏDq.
That is, the Feynman propagator kernel can be represented by a Feynman path
integral. In this section, it is our goal to prove that

itly, N =

The classical trajectory. The action of a classical free particle of mass m on
the real line is given by
S[q] :=

2m ˙q(τ)2 dτ.
The boundary-value problem
m¨q(τ) = 0,
s < τ < t,
q(s) = y, q(t) = x
corresponds to the motion of the particle with given endpoints. The unique solution
is qclass(τ) = y + τ−s

Quantum ﬂuctuations and the WKB relation. In order to study pertur-
bations of the classical trajectory, we consider the trajectories
q(τ) = qclass(τ) + r(τ),
τ ∈[s, t]
where r ∈C2
0[s, t], that is, the function r : [s, t] →R is twice continuously diﬀer-
entiable and satisﬁes the boundary condition r(s) = r(t) = 0. By (7.159) on page
550,
S[q] = S[qclass] + S[r].
(7.206)
For the Feynman propagator kernel, it follows from (7.203) that
K(x, t; y, s) = eiS[qclass]/ℏKﬂuct(t; s)
(7.207)
for all positions x, y ∈R and all times t > s, with the ﬂuctuation term
Kﬂuct(t; s) :=
r
m
2πℏi(t −s).
Equation (7.207) is called the WKB relation for the free quantum particle. It shows
that the Feynman propagator is the product of the purely classical factor eiS[qclass]/ℏ
with a factor caused by quantum ﬂuctuations.
The key relation. Motivated by the decomposition formula (7.206), we deﬁne

with the normalization constant N =

´1/4 e−iπ/8. This implies the key formula
(7.205).
7.9.4 Application to the Quantized Harmonic Oscillator
Parallel to the free quantum particle in the preceding section, let us now study
the harmonic oscillator of mass m > 0 and angular frequency ω > 0 on the real
line. Introduce the characteristic length x0 :=
q
ℏ
mω . Furthermore, choose the time
parameter in such a way that
t
∈]s + tn,crit, s + tn+1,crit[,
n = 0, 1, 2, ...
(7.208)
Here, the critical points of time are deﬁned by tn,crit := nπ
ω . In addition, we intro-
duce the Maslov index by μ(s, t) := n. By formula (7.144) on page 537, we have
computed the Feynman propagator kernel for the quantized harmonic oscillator:
K(x, t; y, s) =
e−iπ/4 e−iπμ(s,t)/2
x0
p
2π| sin ω(t −s)|
exp
„
i(x2 + y2) cos ω(t −s) −2xy
2x2
0 sin ω(t −s)
«
.
This formula is valid for all all positions x, y ∈R and all non-critical times t > s
from (7.208).
The classical trajectory. The action of the classical harmonic oscillator is
given by
S[q] :=
Z t
s
1
2m ˙q(τ)2 −1
2mω2q(τ)2 dτ.
The boundary-value problem
¨q(τ) + ω2q(τ) = 0,
s < τ < t,
q(s) = y, q(t) = x
(7.209)
has the solution qclass(τ) = y cos ω(τ −s) +
`
x −y cos ω(τ −s)
´ sin ω(τ−s)
sin ω(t−s) . This is
a classical trajectory with the action
S[qclass] = ℏ· (x2 + y2) cos ω(t −s) −2xy
2x2
0 sin ω(t −s)
.
Note that the trajectory qclass is the unique solution of (7.209) if t is a non-critical
point of time. The uniqueness is violated for critical points of time. In what follows,
we only consider non-critical points of time (7.208).
Quantum ﬂuctuations and the WKB relation. Now use the perturbed
trajectory
q(t) = qclass(τ) + r(τ),
τ ∈[s, t],
where r ∈C2
0[s, t], that is, the function r : [s, t] →R is twice continuously diﬀer-
entiable and satisﬁes the boundary condition r(s) = r(t) = 0. By (7.165) on page
552, we get

7.9 Rigorous Inﬁnite-Dimensional Gaussian Integrals
577
S[q] = S[qclass] + S[r].
(7.210)
The Feynman propagator kernel for the quantized harmonic oscillator can be writ-
ten as
K(x, t; y, s) = eiS[qclass]/ℏKﬂuct(t; s)
(7.211)
with the quantum ﬂuctuation term
Kﬂuct(t; s) :=
e−iπ/4 e−iπμ(s,t)/2
x0
p
2π| sin ω(t −s)|
.
This is a special case of the WKB method (see (7.216) on page 581). Observe that
the ﬂuctuation term is independent of the position coordinates x and y.
Now we restrict ourselves to the ﬁrst critical time interval, that is, we
assume that t ∈]s, s + t1,crit[.
Our goal is the key relation (7.214) below. Let us ﬁrst compute the following nor-
malized inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integral.
Proposition 7.50 For all times t ∈]s, s + t1,crit[, we have

The complex non-zero constant N(ω) will be determined below.
Proof. We will proceed as in the proof of Prop. 7.49 on page 573. To simplify

ϕ ∈D(B)
corresponds to the equation −¨ϕ(τ) −ω2q(τ) = λϕ(τ), 0 < τ < t with the boundary
condition ϕ(0) = ϕ(t) = 0. The solutions are

Because of the boundary condition r(0) = r(t) = 0, the diﬀerential operator B can
be regarded as an elliptic diﬀerential operator on a circle, which is the simplest ex-
ample of a compact Riemannian manifold. There exists a general theory of elliptic
operators on compact Riemannian manifolds which tells us that the correspond-
ing zeta function can be analytically extended to a meromorphic function on the
complex plane, and this extension is holomorphic at the origin z = 0 (see Gilkey
(1995) and Kirsten (2002)). Therefore, ζB(0) and ζ′
B(0) are well-deﬁned, and we can
use the method of zeta-function regularization. In order to get quickly an explicit
result, we will introduce a modiﬁed method which is used by physicists.
(IV) The determinant det B. Formally, we get

from the proof of Prop. 7.49 on page 573. By this proof, det A = 2t. Therefore, we

This tells us the quite natural fact that the Feynman propagator kernel of the

This hypothesis tells us that the Feynman path integral coincides with the corre-
sponding normalized inﬁnite-dimensional Gaussian integral, up to a normalization
factor N which depends on the action functional S. Physicists take this spectral
hypothesis for granted in both quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory. The
experience of physicists shows that this hypothesis works well as a universal tool.
In terms of mathematics, it turns out that this heuristic tool also works well for
conjecturing new topological invariants in the setting of topological quantum ﬁeld
theory and string theory. For example, this concerns knot theory, smooth manifolds
in diﬀerential geometry, and algebraic varieties (generalized manifolds including sin-
gularities) in algebraic geometry.

7.10 The Semi-Classical WKB Method
The WKB method in physics is the prototype of singular perturbation
theory in mathematics.
Folklore
To the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst paper on path integrals, apart from
Feynman’s, written by a physicist was submitted by C´ecile Morette in
1950.98
During Pauli’s stay at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1949, Morette
and Van Hove presented to Pauli at the occasion of an appointment with
him a semiclassical formula (S) for quantum mechanics based on Morette’s
approach to path integrals. . . Pauli wrote a number of research notes . . . In
these notes Pauli corrected a sign factor, and he obtained the important
(exact) result that for small time intervals, the semiclassical propagator
kernel from (S) satisﬁes the Schr¨odinger equation up to order ℏ2 . . .
Pauli was, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst of the older generation,
having laid the foundations of quantum mechanics, who fully appreciated
the new approach developed by Feynman.99
Christian Grosche and Frank Steiner, 1998
Approximation methods play an important role in physics in order to simplify
computation and to get insight. Let us study an important approximation method
in quantum mechanics called the WKB method.100 The dynamics of a particle in
quantum mechanics is governed by the equation
ψ(t) = e−iH(t−s)/ℏψ(s),
t ≥s.
The quantum particle behaves approximately like a classical particle if Planck’s
quantum of action is small, ℏ→0. More precisely, we have to assume that the
dimensionless quotient S/ℏis large where S is the action (energy times t −s). The
WKB method investigates the semi-classical approximation of quantum processes
with respect to the limit
ℏ→0.
The two key formulas for the motion of quantum particles in the 3-dimensional
Euclidean space read as follows:
(K) Time evolution of Schr¨odinger’s wave function:
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R3 K(x, t; y, s)ψ(y, s)d3y,
x ∈R3,
t > s.
We assume that the function y →ψ(y, s) is smooth with compact support (at
the initial time s).

K(x, t; y, s) = eiS[q]/ℏe−3iπ/4 e−iπμ(s,t)/2
h3/2| det J(t)|1/2
(1 + O(ℏ)).
(7.216)
Here, S[q] is the action of the classical trajectory q = q(τ) which connects the
point y at the initial time s with the point x at the ﬁnal time t (Fig. 7.1(a)).101
Furthermore, μ(s, t) denotes the Morse index (or Maslov index) of the trajectory
q = q(τ) on the time interval [s, t]. Roughly speaking, the Morse index measures
the number and the structure of the focal points on the trajectory. The use of the
Morse index allows us to obtain a global formula for large times. As a rule, the
Morse index jumps at focal points of the trajectory. Now let us discuss this more
precisely.102
Classical particle. We start with the Newtonian equation of motion
m¨q(τ) = −U ′(q),
s ≤τ ≤t
(7.217)
for the trajectory
C : q = q(τ),
s ≤τ ≤t
of a classical particle of mass m in the 3-dimensional Euclidean space. The potential
U = U(q) is assumed to be a smooth real-valued function. The action along the
trajectory C is given by
S[q] :=
Z t
s
( 1
2m ˙q(τ)2 −U(q(τ))dτ.
For the trajectory C, we also study the corresponding Jacobi equation,
m ¨J(τ) + U ′′(q(τ))J(τ) = 0,
s ≤τ ≤t,
along with the initial conditions J(s) = 0 and ˙J(s) = m−1I.103
101 The case where several trajectories connect the point y with the point x will be
considered in (7.218) below. This corresponds to Fig. 7.1(b).
102 The WKB method is always used in physics if a typical physical parameter goes
to zero. For example, this concerns the following limits: T →0 (low temperature),
λ →0 (short wavelength), 1/c →0 (low velocity), ν →0 (low viscosity). In terms
of mathematics, the WKB method is part of singular perturbation theory.

Morse index. By deﬁnition, the Morse index of the trajectory C is equal to
the number of negative eigenvalues λ of the Jacobi eigenvalue problem
−m¨h(τ) −U ′′(q(τ))h(τ) = λh(τ),
s ≤τ ≤t
along with the boundary condition h(s) = h(t) = 0.
Quantum particle. The Schr¨odinger equation for the corresponding quantum
particle reads as
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2m Δψ(x, t) + U(x)ψ(x, t).
Semi-classical approximation. The approximation formula (7.216) is valid
under the following assumptions.104
(H1) Uniqueness: There exists a unique solution q = q(τ), s ≤τ ≤t, of the
classical equation of motion (7.217) which satisﬁes the boundary condition
q(s) = y,
q(t) = x
for given y, t, x, s (Fig. 7.1(a) on page 581).
(H2) Regularity of the trajectory: At the ﬁnal time t, the matrix J(t) is invertible.
Here, τ →J(τ) is the solution of the Jacobi equation with respect to the
trajectory from (H1).
Modiﬁcations. Replace (H1) by the assumption that the boundary value
problem has not a unique solution, but at most a ﬁnite number of trajectories
q = qn(τ), n = 1, . . . , N (Fig. 7.1(b) on page 581). In addition, assume that all of
these trajectories are regular in the sense of (H2). Then, the formula (7.216) has to
be replaced by the following sum formula as ℏ→0:
K(x, t; y, s) =
N
X
n=1
eiS[qn]/ℏe−diπ/4 e−iπμn(s,t)/2
hd/2| det Jn(t)|1/2
(1 + O(ℏ))
(7.218)
with d = 3. For motions of the particles on the real line and in the Euclidean plane,
we have to choose d = 1 and d = 2, respectively. The formula (7.218) is precise
(i.e., O(ℏ) = 0) if the potential U is a quadratic function.
Small time intervals. If the time interval [s, t] is suﬃciently small, then it
follows from
Jn(t) = t −s
m
I + O((t −s)2)
that det Jn(t) ̸= 1. Moreover, μn(s, t) = 0. This simpliﬁes the key formula (7.218).
The quantized harmonic oscillator. To get insight, let us consider the equa-
tion of motion
¨q(τ) = −ω2q(τ),
0 ≤τ ≤t
for a classical harmonic oscillator on the real line. Here, t > 0. Add the boundary
condition105 q(0) = y, q(t) = x. This problem has the unique solution
104 A sketch of the proof based on the path integral can be found in C. Grosche and
F. Steiner, Handbook of Feynman Path Integrals, Sect. 5.2, Springer, Berlin,
1998. For the full proof embedded into a general setting, see the monograph by

7.11 Brownian Motion
In order to understand the beauty of Feynman’s approach to quantum me-
chanics, one has to understand the Brownian motion of immersed particles
and its relation to diﬀusion processes.
Folklore
7.11.1 The Macroscopic Diﬀusion Law
We want to consider the diﬀusion of particles of mass m > 0 on the real line. Let
ϱ(x, t) > 0 denote the mass density of the particles at the position x at time t.
Then the basic diﬀusion equation reads as
ϱt(x, t) = κϱxx(x, t),
x ∈R, t ∈R.
(7.220)
Here, the positive number κ is called the diﬀusion coeﬃcient. Let us motivate this.
Conservation of mass. Let v(x, t) = v(x, t)i denote the velocity vector of the
particles at the point x at time t. Here, the unit vector i points in direction of the
positive x-axis. Furthermore, we introduce the mass current density vector
J(x, t) := ϱ(x, t)v(x, t).
We have J(x, t) = J(x, t)i where
J(x, t) = lim
Δt→0
M(x; t, t + Δt)
Δt
.
Here, M(x; t, t + Δt) is the mass which ﬂows through the point x from left to right
during the time interval [t, t + Δt]. Conservation of mass tells us that the change of
mass on the compact interval [a, b] during the time interval [t, t+Δt] is equal to the
mass which ﬂows through the boundary points during the time interval [t, t + Δt].
Explicitly, for small Δt, we obtain
Z b
a
(ϱ(x, t + Δt) −ϱ(x, t))dt = J(a, t)Δt −J(b, t)Δt,
up to terms of order o(Δt) as Δt →0. Letting Δt →0, we get
Z b
a
ϱt(x, t)dx = J(a, t) −J(b, t) = −
Z b
a
Jx(x, t)dx.
Contracting the interval [a, b] to the point x, we obtain
ϱt(x, t) = −Jx(x, t).
(7.221)
Fick’s empirical diﬀusion law. Motivated by physical experiments, we as-
sume that
J(x, t) = −κϱx(x, t).
That is, the mass current density is proportional to the (negative) spatial derivative
of the mass density. By (7.221), we get the diﬀusion equation (7.220).
In the three-dimensional case, the one-dimensional diﬀusion equation (7.220)
passes over to the three-dimensional diﬀusion equation
ϱt(x, t) = −κΔϱ(x, t)
(7.222)
with the position vector x and time t. Furthermore, Δϱ = −ϱxx −ϱyy −ϱzz.

7.11.2 Einstein’s Key Formulas for the Brownian Motion
We are going to consider the three-dimensional motion of particles of mass m > 0
suspended in a resting ﬂuid. We assume that the suspended particles have a much
greater mass than the molecules of the ambient ﬂuid. The irregular motion of the
suspended particles is caused by a large number of collisions with the molecules of
the ambient ﬂuid. In 1828 the botanist Robert Brown (1773–1858) observed ﬁrst
such an irregular motion under the microscope, which is called Brownian motion
nowadays. In his famous 1905 paper, the young Einstein (1879–1955) derived the
following two key formulas for the random Brownian motion.106
(i) Fluctuation of the position vector x of a single suspended particle:
(Δx)2 = 6κt.
(7.223)
(ii) The Stokes–Einstein relation between the diﬀusion coeﬃcient D of the sus-
pended particles and the viscosity η of the ambient ﬂuid:
κ =
kT
6πηr .
(7.224)
Here, T is the absolute temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, and r is the
radius of the suspended particles.
The physical motivation of the Einstein formulas can be found in Chap. 4 of the
monograph by R. Mazo, Brownian Motion: Fluctuations, Dynamics, and Applica-
tions, Oxford University Press, 2002.
7.11.3 The Random Walk of Particles
The random model. We want to investigate the random walk of a particle on
the real line. To this end, we set
xj := jΔx, j = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . and
tk := kΔt, k = 0, 1, 2, . . .
We deﬁne
P(xj, tk) := probability of ﬁnding the particle at the point xj at time tk.
We assume the following.
(i) The initial condition: The particle is at the origin x0 = 0 at the initial time
t0 = 0. That is, P(0, 0) = 1. Moreover, P(xj, tk) = 0 if xj ̸= 0 or tk > 0.
(ii) The transition condition: Suppose that the particle is at the point xj at time
tk. Then it will be at the point xj+1 (resp. xj−1) at time tk+1 with probability
1
2. Applying this to the motion from xj−1 to xj and from xj+1 to xj, we obtain
that, for all j, k,
P(xj, tk+1) = 1
2P(xj−1, tk) + 1
2P(xj+1, tk).

4πκt . We claim
that the number
Z b
a
p(x, t)dx
(7.226)
equals the probability of ﬁnding the particle in the interval [a, b] at time t.
Motivation. In order to motivate (7.226), let us introduce the (discrete) prob-
ability density
p(xj, tk) := P(xj, tk)
Δx
.
Then the number
jb
X
j=0
p(xj, tk)Δx
equals the probability of ﬁnding the particle in the interval [0, b] at time tk. Here,
we choose jb := b/Δx. By (7.225),
P(xj, tk+1) −P(xj, tk) = 1
2(P(xj+1, tk) −2P(xj, tk) + P(xj−1, tk)).
This implies
p(x, t + Δt) −p(x, t) = 1
2(p(x + Δx, t) −2p(x, t) + p(x −Δx, t)).
Hence
p(x, t + Δt) −p(x, t)
Δt
= p(x + Δx, t) −2p(x, t) + p(x −Δx, t)
(Δx)2
· (Δx)2
2Δt .
Letting Δx →0 and Δt →0 such that the quotient (Δx)2/2Δt goes to the positive
number κ, then
pt(x, t) = κpxx(x, t),
x ∈R, t > 0.
(7.227)
In addition, we obtain the formal initial condition p(x, 0) = δ(x) for all points
x ∈R.107 By the study of the diﬀusion equation on page 487, the solution of
(7.227) reads as p(x, t) = e−x2/4κt
√
4πκt .
7.11.4 The Rigorous Wiener Path Integral
Probabilities of a continuous random walk. Let us consider the random walk
of a particle on the real line with diﬀusion coeﬃcient κ > 0. Choose the function
p(x, t) := e−x2/4κt
√

,
and choose the points of time 0 < t1 < . . . < tN := T. Suppose that the particle is
at the point x0 := 0 at time t0 := 0.

The Wiener measure. We want to translate the preceding probabilities into
the language of measure theory. Fix the time T > 0. By deﬁnition, the function
space C0[0, T] consists of all continuous functions
q : [0, T] →R
with q(0) = 0. Intuitively, x = q(t), 0 ≤t ≤T, describes the trajectory of a
Brownian particle on the real line. We want to construct a measure W on the space
C0[0, T] of trajectories such that, for each measurable subset Ω of C0[0, T], the real
number
W(Ω)
equals the probability of ﬁnding the trajectory q ∈C0[0, T] in the set Ω. We will
proceed in two steps.
Step 1: Pre-measure on cylindrical subsets. Let
Ωcyl := {q ∈C0[0, T] : q(tk) ∈Jk, k = 1, . . . , N}
where 0 < t1 < . . . < tN := T, N = 1, 2, . . . , and J1, . . . JN are intervals on the real
line. We deﬁne the number W(Ωcyl) by (7.228). This number is called the Wiener
pre-measure of the cylindrical set Ωcyl.
Step 2: Extension of the pre-measure to the Wiener measure. The Wiener pre-
measure on cylindrical sets can be extended to a measure on the function space
C0[0, T]. This measure (called the Wiener measure) is uniquely determined on the
smallest σ-algebra of C0[0, T] which contains all the cylindrical sets. For general
measure theory and measure integrals, see Sec. 10.2.1 of Vol. I. Furthermore, we
refer to:
H. Amann and J. Escher, Analysis, Vol. 3, Birkh¨auser, Basel, 2001 (in
German). (English edition in preparation.)

sure Theory, Princeton University Press, 2003.
A detailed summary can be found in the Appendix to Zeidler (1986), Vol. IIB (see

Example. If C1
0[0, T] denotes the set of all continuously diﬀerentiable functions
q : [0, T] →R with q(0) = 0, then
W(C1
0[0, T]) = 0.
This tells us that the trajectory of a Brownian particle is continuously diﬀerentiable
with probability zero. In fact, under the microscope one observes zigzag trajectories
of Brownian motion.
The Wiener path integral. General measure theory tells us that the Wiener
measure W on the function space C0[0, T] induces the measure integral

7.11.5 The Feynman–Kac Formula
In 1947, Marc Kac (1914–1984) attended a lecture given by the young Richard
Feynman (1918–1988) at Cornell University. He was amazed about the fact that
Feynman’s formula related the quantum mechanical propagator to classical mechan-
ics in a very elegant way. He also noticed that Feynman’s idea of the path integral
was close to his own ideas about stochastic processes based on the Wiener integral
due to Norbert Wiener (1894–1964). A few days later Kac rigorously proved a for-
mula which is known nowadays as the Feynman–Kac formula. In his autobiography
Enigmas of Chance, Harper & Row, New York, 1985, Marc Kac writes:
It is only fair to say that I had Wiener’s shoulders to stand on. Feynman
as in everything else he has done, stood on its own, a trick of intellectual
contortion that he alone is capable of.
In order to discuss the Feynman–Kac formula, let us consider the one-dimensional
diﬀusion equation
ϱt(x, t) = κϱxx(x, t) −U(x)ϱ(x, t),
x ∈R, t > 0
(7.229)
with the initial condition ϱ(x, 0) = ϱ0(x) for all x ∈R. We are given the positive
diﬀusion constant κ, the real-valued potential U ∈C∞
0 (R), and the real-valued
initial mass density ϱ0 ∈C∞
0 (R). Deﬁne
Hϱ := −κϱxx + Uϱ
for all
ϱ ∈C∞
0 (R).
The operator H : C∞
0 (R) →L2(R) can be uniquely extended to a self-adjoint
operator H : D(H) →L2(R) on the real Hilbert space L2(R). In terms of functional
analysis, the solution of (7.229), that is, ϱt = −Hϱ, reads as
ϱ(t) = e−tHϱ0,
t > 0.
(7.230)
The famous Feynman–Kac formula tells us the following.

7.11 Brownian Motion
589
Theorem 7.51 For all times T > 0 and all positions x ∈R, the solution (7.230)
of the diﬀusion equation (7.229) is given by
ϱ(x, T) =
Z
C0[0,T ]
ϱ0(x + q(t)) e−
R T
0 U(x+q(t))dt dW(q).
Intuitively, this is a statistics over all possible continuous trajectories of a par-
ticle which starts at the point x at time t = 0. The statistical weight is related
to both the Wiener measure and an exponential function which depends on the
potential U. The proof can be found in:

ational Calculus, Chap. 12, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 2000.

7.12 Weyl Quantization
The use of the Moyal product for smooth functions avoids the use of
Hilbert-space operators in quantum mechanics.
Folklore
We can say that quantum mechanics is a deformation of classical mechan-
ics. The Planck constant h is the corresponding deformation parameter.
This is for me the most concise formulation of the correspondence principle
and explains what is meant by quantization.
Beautiful results, which I learned from A. Lichnerowicz, M. Flato, and
D. Sternheimer, allow one to say that classical mechanics is unstable and
that quantum mechanics is essentially a unique deformation of it into a
nonequivalent stable structure.109

7.12 Weyl Quantization
591
The elegant method of deformation quantization is based on the use of classical
smooth functions equipped with the Moyal star product. This star product repre-
sents a deformation of the classical product of functions. The deformation depends
on the Planck constant h. The ﬁrst quantum correction of the classical product is
related to the Poisson bracket in classical mechanics. The relation between defor-
mation quantization and the operator-theoretic approach to quantum mechanics in
Hilbert spaces is given by the Weyl calculus.
In the following sections, we will only sketch the basic ideas. We will start with
the formal language used by physicists. From the mnemonic point of view, the
language of physicists is very convenient. Unfortunately, rigorous mathematical ar-
guments are more involved. The rigorous Weyl calculus will be considered in Sect.
7.12.6; this represents a special case of the modern theory of pseudo-diﬀerential op-
erators, which combines diﬀerential operators with integral operators in the setting
of generalized functions. We would like to encourage the reader to learn both the
language of physicists and the language of mathematicians.
7.12.1 The Formal Moyal Star Product
Let C∞(R2) be the space of smooth functions f : R2 →C. For f, g ∈C∞(R2), the
formal Moyal star product is deﬁned by
f ∗g := fe
iℏ
2 (∂′
q∂p−∂′
p∂q)g.
Here, the functions f and g depend on the real variables q and p, and we set
∂q := ∂/∂q and ∂p := ∂/∂p. In addition, the prime of ∂′
q indicates that the partial
derivative acts on the left factor f. Explicitly,
f ∗g =
∞
X
m,n=0
„iℏ
2
«m+n (−1)m
m!n!
(∂m
p ∂n
q f)(∂n
p ∂m
q g).
(7.234)
This is to be understood as a formal power series with respect to the variable ℏ.
The Moyal star product has the following properties.
(i) The correspondence principle: For all f, g ∈C∞(R2),
f ∗g = fg + iℏ
2 {f, g} + O(ℏ2),
ℏ→0.
Here, we use the Poisson bracket {f, g} := fqgp −gqfp. Hence
f ∗g −g ∗f = iℏ{f, g} + O(ℏ2),
ℏ→0.
Therefore, the star product f ∗g represents a deformation of the classical
product fg. This deformation depends on the Planck constant ℏ. In terms of
physics, the diﬀerence f ∗g −fg describes quantum ﬂuctuations which depend
on ℏ. For example, if we choose f(q, p) := q and g(q, p) := p, then q∗p = qp+ 1
2iℏ
and p ∗q = pq −1
2iℏ. Hence
q ∗p −p ∗q = iℏ.
This commutation rule (for the Moyal star product of classical smooth func-
tions) corresponds to the Born–Heisenberg–Jordan commutation relation QP −
PQ = iℏI (in the operator-theoretic formulation of quantum mechanics on
Hilbert spaces). As we will show below, the use of the Moyal star product
avoids the use of operators.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
(ii) Associativity: For all f, g, k ∈C∞(R2), we have
(f ∗g) ∗k = f ∗(g ∗k).
7.12.2 Deformation Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The basic equations of deformation quantization. We want to apply the
method of deformation quantization to the motion of a particle on the real line.
The classical trajectory q = q(t) is described by the canonical equations
˙p(t) = −Hq(q(t), p(t)),
˙q(t) = Hp(q(t), p(t)),
t ∈R.
We are given the Hamiltonian H ∈C∞(R2).
The corresponding quantum motion is obtained by solving the following prob-
lem. We are looking for
• a nonempty index set M,
• a measure μ on the set M,
• functions ϱm = ϱm(q, p) on the phase space R2 for each index m ∈M, and
• real values Em for each index m ∈M
such that the following equations hold.
(E) Quantized energy levels Em:
H ∗ϱm = Emϱm
for all
m ∈M.
(D) Distribution function ϱm: For all indices m, n ∈M, we have the orthogonality
relation
ϱm ∗ϱn = 0,
m ̸= n,
along with the idempotent law
ϱm ∗ϱm = ϱm,
and the normalization relation on the phase space,
Z
R2 ϱm(q, p)dqdp
h
= 1.
(Q) Quantized energy decomposition of the classical Hamiltonian function:110
H(q, p) =
Z
M
Emϱm(q, p)dμ(m)
for all
q, p ∈R.
(M) Mean value of energy: For all m ∈M,
Em =
Z
R2 H(q, p)ϱm(q, p) dqdp
h
.
In terms of physics, this means that each of the functions ϱm = ϱm(q, p) is
a probability distribution on the phase space which has the quantized energy
level Em as energy mean value.
110 In the special case where M := {0, 1, , 2 . . .}, the integral
R
M Emϱm(q, p)dμ(m) is
equal to the inﬁnite series P∞
m=0 Emϱm(q, p)μm. Here, the nonnegative number
μm is the measure of the point {m} for all m = 0, 1, . . .

7.12 Weyl Quantization
593
Suppose that we know a solution of the equations (E) through (M) above. Then,
to a given complex-valued function F : R →C we can assign the star function F∗
deﬁned by
F∗(q, p) :=
Z
M
F(Em)ϱm(q, p)dμ(m)
for all
q, p ∈R.
For example, we may formally deﬁne the exponential star function
Exp∗(αtH)(q, p) :=
Z
m∈M
eαtH(q,p)ϱm(q, p)dμ(m)
for all q, p ∈R, all times t ∈R, and ﬁxed complex number α. Formally, it follows
from (E) above that
d
dtExp∗(αtH) = αH ∗Exp∗(αtH) .
This equation is called the Schr¨odinger equation in quantum deformation. In con-
crete models, one has to check that all of the equations formulated above possess a
rigorous meaning, in the sense of well-deﬁned formal expansions with respect to ℏ.
Let us show how quantum deformation works for the harmonic oscillator. In this
case, we choose M = {0, 1, 2, , ...} and μm := 1 for all m.
Application to the harmonic oscillator. The classical function
H(q, p) := p2
2m + mω2q2
2
is the Hamiltonian for a harmonic oscillator of mass m and angular frequency ω
on the real line. To simplify the computation, it is useful to introduce the new
dimensionless variable
a :=

«
(7.235)
and the conjugate complex variable
a† =
r
mω

q −ip

.
(7.236)
Hence
H = ℏωaa†.
By the chain rule, the Moyal star product reads as
f ∗g = fe

2 (∂′
a∂a† −∂′
a† ∂a)g
with respect to the new variables a and a†. Here, we set ∂a := ∂/∂a, as well
as ∂a† := ∂/∂a†, and we regard f and g as functions of the variables a and a†.
Explicitly, we obtain111
111 If one wants to see the dependence on the parameter ℏ, then one has to replace
a by
√
ℏ· b. This yields b ∗b† −b† ∗b = ℏ, and

Motivation for the deformation quantization of the harmonic oscil-
lator. We want to show how the method of deformation quantization considered
above is related to Schr¨odinger’s operator-theoretic treatment of the harmonic os-
cillator studied on page 534. Consider the operators
Qpre, Ppre, Hpre : S(R) →S(R)
with Qpreϕ(q) := qϕ(q) and Ppreϕ(q) = −iℏϕ′(q) for all q ∈R, as well as
Hpre := P 2
pre
2m + mω2Qpre
2
.
Using the Dirac calculus, let |ϕ0⟩, |ϕ1⟩, . . . denote the complete orthonormal system
of eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian Hpre. That is,
Hpre|ϕm⟩= Em|ϕm⟩,
m = 0, 1, 2, . . .
with Em := ℏω(m + 1
2). In addition, let us introduce the operator
ϱm := |ϕm⟩⟨ϕm|,
m = 0, 1, . . .
This is the von Neumann density operator corresponding to the eigenstate |ϕm⟩.
Then, for all indices m, n = 0, 1, . . . and all times t ∈R, the following hold:112
(a) Hpreϱm = Emϱm;
(b) Hpre = P∞
m=0 Emϱm;
(c) ϱmϱn = δmnϱm;
(d) iℏd
dte−itHpre/ℏ= Hpree−itHpre/ℏ.
Relation (a) follows from
(Hpreϱm)|ϕm⟩= Hpre|ϕm⟩⟨ϕm|ϕ⟩= Em|ϕm⟩⟨ϕm|ϕ⟩= Emϱm|ϕ⟩.
Relations (b) and (d) are a consequence of
f(Hpre)ϕ =

m=0
f(Em)|ϕm⟩⟨ϕm|ϕ⟩
for all ϕ ∈S(R), where f(x) := x or f(x) := e−ixt/ℏfor all x ∈R. Finally, relation
(c) follows from
|ϕm⟩⟨ϕm|ϕn⟩⟨ϕm|ϕ⟩= Emδmn|ϕm⟩⟨ϕm|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
This ﬁnishes the proof of (a)–(d). In the following sections, we will introduce the
Weyl calculus. Here,
112 Explicitly, condition (b) means that Hpreϕ = P∞
m=0 Emϱmϕ for all ϕ ∈S(R),

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• operators have to be replaced by their symbols, and
• operator products have to be replaced by the Moyal star product of the corre-
sponding symbols.
Replacing the operators Hpre, ϱm, e−iHpre/ℏby their symbols H, ϱm, F, the formulas
(a)–(d) pass over to the following formulas:
(a∗) H ∗ϱm = Emϱm;
(b∗) H = P∞

the symbols a and a† are given by (7.235) and (7.236), respectively. The operator
commutation relation aa†−a†a = I corresponds to the Moyal-star-product relation
a∗a† −a† ∗a = 1 for the symbols in the Weyl calculus. This coincides with (7.238).
7.12.3 Weyl Ordering
The Moyal star product of classical symbols passes over to the operator
product of the corresponding Weyl operators.
Folklore
As a preparation for the general Weyl calculus, let us start with the rigorous theory
of Weyl polynomials. In the quantum mechanics of particles on the real line, we
encounter both113
• the position operator Q : S(R) →S(R) given by (Qψ)(q) := qψ(q) and
• the momentum operator P : S(R) →S(R) given by (Pψ)(q) := −iℏψ′(q)
for all ψ ∈S(R) and all q ∈R. These two basic operators are formally self-adjoint
on the Hilbert space L2(R), that is,
⟨Qψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|Qϕ⟩
and
⟨Pψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|Pϕ⟩
for all
ψ, ϕ ∈S(R).
Here, we use the inner product ⟨ψ|χ⟩:=
R
R ψ†(q)χ(q)dq on L2(R). In other words,
Q† = Q and P † = P.114
Weyl polynomials with respect to the operators Q and P on the linear
function space S(R). Consider an arbitrary polynomial
a(q, p) :=
N
X
k,m=0
ckmqkpm
for all
q, p ∈R
(7.239)
with respect to the real variables q and p. Here, the coeﬃcients ckm are complex
numbers. It is our goal to assign to each polynomial a a linear operator
113 To simplify notation, we write the operator symbol Q (resp. P) instead of Qpre
(resp. Ppre).
114 In addition, the operators Q, P : S(R) →S(R) are essentially self-adjoint on the
Hilbert space L2(R).

7.12 Weyl Quantization
597
A(a) : S(R) →S(R),
which is a polynomial with respect to Q and P, such that the following properties
hold.
(W1) Linearity: For all polynomials a, b and all complex numbers α, β, we get
A(αa + βb) = αA(a) + βA(b).
In particular, if a(q, p) := q and b(q, p) := p, then A(a) := Q and A(b) := P.
Furthermore, A(1) = I (identity operator).
(W2) Weyl ordering: If a(q, p) := qp, then115
A(a) = 1
2(QP + PQ).
(W3) Formal self-adjointness: If the coeﬃcients of the polynomial a are real, then
the Weyl operator A(a) is formally self-adjoint. Explicitly,
⟨A(a)ψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|A(a)ϕ⟩
for all
ψ, ϕ ∈S(R).
In other words, the Weyl polynomials A(a) to real polynomials a are formal
observables in quantum mechanics.
(W4) Composition rule: If a and b are polynomials, then116
A(a ∗b) = A(a)B(b).
This means that the Moyal star product of polynomials is translated into the
operator product of Weyl polynomials on the space S(R). This is the charac-
teristic property of the Moyal star product.
In about 1930, it was the idea of Weyl to introduce the symmetric Weyl polynomials
(qkpm)W by setting
• (qk)W := Qk and (pm)W := P m, where m, k = 0, 1, . . .;
• (qp)W := 1
2(QP + PQ);
• (q2p)W := 1
3(Q2P + PQ2 + QPQ);
• (q2p2)W := 1
6(Q2P 2 + P 2Q2 + QP 2Q + PQ2P + QPQP + PQPQ).
In the general case, we proceed as follows. In order to obtain (qkpm)W , we start
with the symmetrized expression
(A1A2 · · · Ak+m)sym :=
1
(k + m)!
X
π
Aπ(1)Aπ(2) · · · Aπ(k+m)
where we sum over all possible permutations π of 1, 2, . . . , k + m. Finally, we set
A1 = . . . = Ak := Q and Ak+1 = . . . = Ak+m := P. For each polynomial a from
(7.239), we now deﬁne the Weyl polynomial
115 This expression is symmetric with respect to Q and P. Furthermore, the operator
A(a) : S(R) →S(R) is formally self-adjoint, that is,
A(a)† := 1
2(P †Q† + Q†P †) = 1
2(PQ + QP) = A(a).
These properties would fail if we would assign to qp the operators QP or PQ .
116 Note that the Moyal star product a ∗b from (7.234) on page 591 is a ﬁnite sum
if a = a(q, p) and b = b(q, p) are polynomials.

(7.240)
The polynomial a is called the symbol of the Weyl polynomial A(a).
Proposition 7.56 The Weyl correspondence (7.240) possesses the properties (W1)
through (W4) formulated above.
In particular, it follows from (W4) above that the symbol of the operator prod-
uct A(a)A(b) is the Moyal star product a∗b of the symbols a and b of the operators
A(a) and B(a), respectively.
The proof of Prop. 7.56 is elementary. For the Moyal star product one has to
use an induction argument. For example, it follows from relation (7.237) on page
594 that q ∗p = qp + 1
2iℏ. Hence
A(q ∗p) = A(qp) + 1
2iℏA(1) = 1
2(QP + PQ) + 1
2iℏI.
Using the commutation relation QP −PQ = iℏI, we obtain
A(q ∗p) = QP = A(q)A(p).
Proposition 7.57 Let k = 0, 1, 2, . . . and r, s ∈C. The operator (rQ + sP)k is the
Weyl operator to the polynomial a(q, p) := (rq + sp)k.
The proof is elementary. For example, we have
(rq + sp)2 = r2q2 + 2rsqp + s2p2
and (rQ + sP)2 = (rQ + sP)(rQ + sP) = r2Q2 + rs(QP + PQ) + s2P 2. Hence
(rQ + sP)2 = r2(q2)W + 2rs(qp)W + s2(p2)W .

This formal expression is frequently used by physicists.
Inductive construction of the Weyl operators. One can show that, for all
polynomials a of the form (7.239), the following rigorous formulas hold:
QA(a) = A(qa + 1
2iℏap),
A(a)Q = A(qa −1
2iℏaq),
PA(a) = A(pa −1
2iℏap),
A(a)P = A(pa + 1
2iℏap).
For example, if a(q, p) := p, then we get QP = QA(p) = A(qp) + 1
2iℏI. In addition,
we have PQ = A(p)Q = A(qp) −1
2ℏiI. Hence QP + PQ = 2A(qp).
7.12.4 Operator Kernels
Operator kernels generalize matrix elements; they relate diﬀerential oper-
ators to integral operators, in a generalized sense. The formal approach
was introduced by Paul Dirac in the late 1920s (Dirac calculus). The rig-
orous theory is based on the kernel theorem which was proved by Laurent
Schwartz in the late 1940s (theory of tempered distributions).118
Folklore
Classical kernels. For given function A ∈S(R2), we deﬁne
(Aψ)(x) :=
Z
R2 A(x, y)ψ(y)dy,
x ∈R
for all functions ψ ∈S(R). The function A is called the kernel of the linear, sequen-
tially continuous operator
A : S(R) →S(R).
(7.242)
Each function ϕ ∈S(R) corresponds to a tempered distribution Tϕ ∈S(R) given
by
Tϕ(χ) :=
Z
R
ϕ(x)χ(x)dx
for all
χ ∈S(R).
The map ϕ →Tϕ is an injective, linear, sequentially continuous map from S(R)
into S′(R). Identifying ϕ with Tϕ, we get S(R) ⊆S′(R). In this sense, the map
ψ →Aψ →TAψ yields the linear, sequentially continuous operator
A : S(R) →S′(R).
Explicitly, we obtain
(Aψ)(χ) =
Z
R2 A(x, y)χ(x)ψ(y)dxdy
for all
ψ, χ ∈S(R).

medal for creating the theory of distributions in about 1945.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Here, we brieﬂy write (Aψ)(χ) instead of TAψ(χ). Introducing the tempered distri-
bution A ∈S′(R2) by setting
A(ϱ) :=
Z
R2 A(x, y)ϱ(x, y)dxdy
for all
ϱ ∈S(R2),
equation (7.243) tells us that
(Aψ)(χ) = A(χ ⊗ψ)
for all
ψ, χ ∈S(R).
(7.244)
The product property of kernels. If the kernels A, B ∈S(R2) correspond
to the operators A, B : S(R) →S(R), respectively, then the product operator AB
has the kernel C given by the product formula
C(x, y) :=
Z
R
A(x, z)B(z, y)dz
for all
x, y ∈R.
(7.245)
This relation generalizes the matrix product. To prove (7.245), set χ := Aψ and
ψ := Bϕ. Then χ = (AB)ϕ. Hence
χ(x) =
Z
R
A(x, z)(Bϕ)(z)dz =
Z
R
„Z
R
A(x, z)B(z, y)dz
«
ϕ(y)dy.
The kernel of the position operator Q. For all χ, ψ ∈S(R),
(Qψ)(χ) =
Z
R2 χ(x)xψ(x)dx.
(7.246)
Using the Dirac delta function, the equation (Qψ)(x) = xψ(x) can formally be
written as
(Qψ)(x) =
Z
R
xδ(x −y)ψ(y)dy
for all
x ∈R.
Thus, the function Q(x, y) := xδ(x−y) is the formal kernel of the position operator
Q. Using the Dirac calculus119, the formal kernel of the position operator Q can
also be obtained by
Q(x, y) = ⟨x|Q|y⟩= y⟨x|y⟩= yδ(x −y) = xδ(x −y).
The kernel of the momentum operator P. For all χ, ψ ∈S(R),
(Pψ)(χ) =
Z
R2(−iℏψ′(x))χ(x)dx.
(7.247)
In order to get the formal kernel P of the operator P used by physicists, we start
with the (rescaled) Fourier transformation
(Fϕ)(p) :=
1
√
2πℏ
Z
R
e−ixp/ℏϕ(x)dx,
ϕ(x) =
1
√
2πℏ
Z
R
eixp/ℏ(Fϕ)(p)dp.
Here, the operator F : S(R) →S(R) is bijective, linear, and sequentially continuous,
and the inverse operator F −1 has the same properties. It follows from
119 See page 596 of Volume I.

7.12 Weyl Quantization
601
F(Pψ)(p) = p(Fψ)(p)
that we have the formal relation
F(Pψ)(p) =
Z
R
pδ(p −r)(Fψ)(r)dr
for all
p ∈R.
This implies (Pψ)(x) =

(7.248)
Using the Dirac calculus (i.e., the completeness relation

kernel can also be obtained by
P(x, y) = ⟨x|P|y⟩=
Z
R

Noting that ⟨p|P|r⟩= r⟨p|r⟩= rδ(p −r) = pδ(p −r) and ⟨x|p⟩= eixp/ℏ/
√
2πℏ,
again we get (7.248).
The Schwartz kernel theorem. Let A : S(R) →S′(R) be a linear, sequen-
tially continuous operator (e.g., the Weyl operator A(a) to the polynomial symbol
a). Then there exists precisely one tempered distribution A ∈S′(R2) such that
(Aψ)(χ) = A(χ ⊗ψ)
for all
ψ, χ ∈S(R).
(7.249)
The tempered distribution A is called the kernel of the operator A.
This theorem generalizes (7.244). The kernels of the operators Q and P are
given by (7.246) and (7.247), respectively.
Nuclear spaces. The Schwartz kernel theorem is the special case of a func-
tional-analytic theorem about bilinear forms on nuclear spaces. A Hilbert space
is nuclear iﬀits dimension is ﬁnite. Furthermore, the inﬁnite-dimensional spaces
D(Rn) and S(Rn) are nuclear for n = 1, 2, . . . For the theory of nuclear spaces
and their important applications in harmonic analysis, we refer to the following
monographs:

The theory of nuclear spaces was created by Grothendieck in the 1950s. In the
1955s, Grothendieck left analysis, and he moved to algebra and geometry. For his
seminal contributions to algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and functional
analysis, Alexandre Grothendieck (born 1928 in Berlin) was awarded the Fields
medal in 1966. His childhood and youth was overshadowed by German fascism. His
father died in the German concentration camp Auschwitz in 1942. We refer to:

7.12.5 The Formal Weyl Calculus
Our goal is to extend the relation between polynomial symbols a = a(q, p) and
Weyl operators A(a) to more general symbols a. In order to motivate the rigorous
approach to be considered in Sect. 7.12.6, let us start with purely formal arguments
used by physicists. The key formulas read as follows.
(i) Superposition: For the symbol
a(q, p) =
1
2πℏ
Z
R2 ei(xq+yp)/ℏˆa(x, y)dxdy,
q, p ∈R,
the Weyl operator is given by
A(a) :=
1
2πℏ
Z
R2 ei(xQ+yP )/ℏˆa(x, y)dxdy.
(7.250)
Here, ˆa = ˆa(x, y) is the (rescaled) Fourier transform of a = (q, p).
(ii) The kernel formula: We have
(Aψ)(x) =
Z
R
A(x, y)ψ(y)dy,
x ∈R
with the formal kernel
A(x, y) =
1
2πℏ
Z
R
eip(x−y)/ℏa
“x + y
2
, p
”
dp,
x, y ∈R.
(7.251)
The inverse Fourier transformation yields
a(q, p) =
Z
R
eirp/ℏA(q −1
2r, q + 1
2r)dr,
q, p ∈R.
(7.252)
(iii) Formal self-adjointness: For the formally adjoint operator of the Weyl operator
A(a) on the Hilbert space L2(R), we get
A(a)† = A(a†).
In particular, if the function a is real-valued, then the corresponding Weyl
operator A(a) is formally self-adjoint on the Hilbert space L2(R).

7.12 Weyl Quantization
603
(iv) The composition formula: If the symbols a = a(q, p) and b = b(q, p) correspond
to the Weyl operators A(a) and A(b), then the operator product is given by
A(a)A(b) = A(a ∗b)
with the star product
(a ∗b)(q, p) :=
1
π2ℏ2
Z
R4 e2ϱ i/ℏa(q1, p1)b(q2, p2) dq1dp1dq2dp2
for all q, p ∈R. Here, the function ϱ = ϱ(q, p, q1, p1, q2, p2) is deﬁned by
ϱ :=
˛˛˛˛˛˛˛
q
p 1
q1 p1 1
q2 p2 1
˛˛˛˛˛˛˛
= q(p1 −p2) + p(q2 −q1) + (q1p2 −p1q2).
If ˆb denotes the (rescaled) Fourier transform of b, that is,
ˆb(ξ, η) =
1
2πℏ
Z
R2 e−i(qξ+pη)/ℏb(q, p) dqdp,
(7.253)
then
(a ∗b)(q, p) =
1
2πℏ
Z
R2 ei(qξ+pη)/ℏa

expansion, this implies

q + iℏ

∂
∂p2 , p −iℏ

∂

«
b(q2, p2)|q2=q,p2=p.
Here, we have to assume that a is a polynomial (or a formal power series
expansions with respect to q and p). Finally, note that the star product a ∗b
coincides with the formal Moyal star product, that is,
a ∗b =

Let us motivate this in a formal manner. To simplify notation, we set ℏ:= 1.
Ad (i) See formula (7.241) on page 599.
Ad (ii). (I) Commutation relation. It follows from QP −PQ = iI that
QnP −PQn = inQn−1,
n = 1, 2, . . .
by induction. If F(Q) = a0I + a1Q + a2Q2 + . . . , then we formally get
F(Q)P −PF(Q) = iF ′(Q).
In particular, e−itrQP −Pe−itrQ = tr · e−itrQ for all t, r ∈R.
(II) Let us prove the key relation
eit(rQ+sP ) = eit2rs/2 · eitrQeitsP ,
r, s ∈R.
(7.255)

604
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
To this end, we set U(t) := e−itsP e−itrQeit(rQ+sP ) for all t ∈R. Diﬀerentiating with
respect to time t and using (I), we obtain
U ′(t) = −ise−itsP “
Pe−itrQ −e−itrQP
”
eit(rQ+sP ) = itrsU(t).
Since U(0) = I, we get U(t) = eit2rs/2I. This implies (7.255).
(III) Setting t = 1, we obtain
ei(rQ+sP ) = eirs/2 · eirQeisP ,
r, s ∈R.
Recall that iPψ = ψ′. By Taylor expansion,
(eisP ψ)(x) = ψ(x) + sψ′(x) + s2
2! ψ′′(x) + . . . = ψ(x + s).
Similarly,
(eirQψ)(x) = ψ(x) + irxψ(x) + (irx)2
2!
ψ(x) + . . . = eirxψ(x).
Hence (ei(rQ+sP )ψ)(x) = eirs/2eirxψ(x + s) for all x ∈R.
(IV) We brieﬂy write A instead of A(a). By (7.250),
(Aψ)(x) = 1
2π

R2 eirxeirs/2ψ(x + s) ˆa(r, s)drds.
Inserting ˆa(r, s) =

Since

(Aψ)(x) = 1
2π
Z
R2 e−isp a(x + 1
2s, p)ψ(x + s)dpds.
Finally, the substitution y = x + s yields the desired result
(Aψ)(x) = 1

R2 ei(x−y)p a

x, y ∈R.
Again by (ii), this is equal to A(y, x)†. Hence A(a†) = A(a)†.
Ad (iv). (I) The kernel C of the operator product C := A(a)A(b) is given by
C(x, y) =
Z
R
A(x, z)B(z, y)dz.
By (ii), we have the following relations between the symbols a, b and the kernels
A, B, respectively:

and setting ϱ := (q −q2)p1 + (q1 −q)p2 + (q2 −q1)p, we obtain

7.12.6 The Rigorous Weyl Calculus
It is possible to translate the formal Weyl calculus into a rigorous mathematical
approach by using the language of generalized functions. It is our goal to assign to
a general class of symbols Weyl operators in such a way that
• the theory of Weyl polynomials from Sect. 7.12.3 is generalized and
• the formal Weyl calculus from Sect. 7.12.5 gets a rigorous mathematical basis.
The proofs of the following statements can be found in the monographs by L.
H¨ormander, The Analysis of Linear Partial Diﬀerential Operators, Vol. 3, Springer,
New York, 1983, and by M. de Gosson, Symplectic Geometry and Quantum Me-
chanics, Birkh¨auser, Basel, 2006.
Smooth, rapidly decreasing symbols. Let a, b ∈S(R). The functions a and
b are called symbols. Then the following hold.
(i) Weyl operator: For given symbol a, deﬁne the Weyl operator
(A(a)ψ)(x) :=
Z
R
A(x, y)ψ(y)dy,
x ∈R
for all ψ ∈S(R) with the kernel
A(x, y) :=
1
2πℏ
Z
R
eip(x−y)/ℏa
“x + y
2
, p
”
dp,
x, y ∈R.
Then A ∈S(R2), and the operator A(a) : S(R) →S(R) is linear and sequen-
tially continuous.
(ii) Bilinear form: Let χ, ψ ∈S(R2). Then
(A(a)ψ)(χ) =
Z
R2 A(x, y)ϕ(x)ψ(y)dy,
x, y ∈R.
Hence
(A(a)ψ)(χ) =
1

Z
R2 eip(x−y)/ℏa
“x + y

”
χ(x)ψ(y)dxdydp.
Using the substitution y = 2q −x, x = x, we get

607
(A(a)ψ)(χ) = 1
πℏ
Z
R2 e2ip(x−q)/ℏa (q, p) χ(x)ψ(2q −x)dxdqdp.
This implies
(A(a)ψ)(χ) =

R2 a(q, p)ϱχ,ψ(q, p)dqdp
(7.260)
with ϱχ,ψ(q, p) :=
1
πℏ
R
R e2ip(x−q)/ℏχ(x)ψ(2q −x)dx.
(ii) Formal self-adjointnes: We get
A(a)† = A(a†).
This means that ⟨A(a†)ϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|A(a)ψ⟩for all ψ, ϕ ∈S(R), where ⟨.|.⟩is the
inner product on the Hilbert space L2(R).
(iii) The composition formula and the rigorous Moyal star product: For the oper-
ator product, we have
A(a)A(b) = A(a ∗b)
together with the rigorous Moyal star product120
(a ∗b)(q, p) :=
1
π2ℏ2
Z
R4 e2ϱi/ℏa(q1, p1) · b(q2, p2) dq1dp1dq2dp2

q1 p1 1
q2 p2 1
˛˛˛˛˛˛˛
= q(p1 −p2) + p(q2 −q1) + (q1p2 −p1q2).
(7.261)
This coincides with (7.256).
(iv) Associativity of the Moyal star product: For all a, b, c ∈S(R), we have
(a ∗b) ∗c = a ∗(b ∗c).
Tempered distributions as symbols. Let a ∈S′(R2). Motivated by (7.260),
deﬁne
(A(a)ψ)(χ) := a(ϱχ,ψ)
χ, ψ ∈S(R).
Then A(a)ψ ∈S′(R), and the linear operator A(a) : S(R) →S′(R) is sequen-
tially continuous. In particular, if a = a(q, p) is a polynomial with respect to
the variables q and p, then the corresponding tempered distribution is given by
a(ϱ) =
R
R2 a(q, p)ϱ(q, p)dqdp for all ϱ ∈S(R2).
120 In the general case, the rigorous Moyal star product (7.261) diﬀers from the
formal Moyal star product (7.254). This is discussed in G. Piacitelli, Nonlocal
theories: new rules for old diagrams, 2004. Internet: arXiv: hep-th/0403055

gral with respect to a measure in the function space runs into practically
insurmountable diﬃculties here and is thus also imperfect. Our own view
is that the Feynman path integral should be understood as the limit of
ﬁnite-dimensional approximations. But which approximations? The path
integral proves to be very sensitive to the choice of its approximations,
the resulting ambiguity being of the same nature as the non-uniqueness of
quantization.121

It is our goal to use the Weyl calculus in order to get the two magic formulas (7.274)
on page 614 and (7.277) on page 615 for the kernel of the Feynman propagator
operator and the kernel of the Heisenberg scattering operator, respectively. It turns
out that the Weyl calculus relates the Feynman propagator kernel to the Feynman
path integral in a quite natural manner.
Basic ideas. Consider the motion q = q(t) of a classical particle on the real
line with the equation of motion
˙p(t) = −aq(q(t), p(t)),
˙q(t) = ap(q(t), p(t)),
t ∈R.
Here, the given classical Hamiltonian a : R2 →R is assumed to be smooth. Now we
pass to the corresponding quantum particle. Then we have to study the Schr¨odinger
equation
iℏψt = Hψ,
ψ(t0) = ψ0
(7.262)
for the wave function ψ = ψ(x, t) of the quantum particle on the Hilbert space
L2(R).
In terms of Weyl quantization, the operator H = A(a) is the Weyl operator
related to the symbol a = a(q, p). This operator is called the Hamiltonian (or
energy operator) of the quantum particle. It is our goal to study both
• the full dynamics of the quantum particle (i.e., the Feynman propagator operator
P(t, t0) := e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ), and
• scattering processes for the quantum particle (i.e., the Heisenberg scattering
operator S(t, t0) := eitHfree/ℏe−i(t−t0)H/ℏe−it0Hfree/ℏ). Here, we assume that the
Hamiltonian H is a perturbation of the free Hamiltonian Hfree. Explicitly,
H = Hfree + κU.
(7.263)
A scattering process is characterized by the property that the motion of the
quantum particle is free in the remote past (t0 →−∞) and in the far future
(t →+∞). The free Hamiltonian Hfree = P 2/2m is the Weyl operator to the
symbol afree(p) := p2/2m, and the operator U is the Weyl operator to the symbol
q →U(q). The real number κ is called coupling constant. Summarizing, the
Hamiltonian operator H has the symbol
a(q, p) = p2
2m + κU(q).

7.13 Two Magic Formulas
609
We will proceed in the following manner.
(a) Evolution operators: We start with time-dependent operators in the Hilbert
space L2(R) (i.e., the Feynman propagator and the Heisenberg scattering op-
erator).
(b) Kernels: The evolution operators can be described by kernels depending on
space and time coordinates.
(c) Causality: The kernel on a ﬁnite time interval is the superposition of kernels
on small time intervals.
(d) Reduction to operator symbols: The kernel of a small time interval can be
computed by using the kernel formula of the Weyl calculus, which depends on
the symbol of the evolution operator.
(e) Limit: If the small time interval goes to zero, then the kernel of the evolution
operator can be expressed by a Feynman path integral, which depends on the
symbol a of the Hamiltonian operator.
This way, we obtain an elegant relation between classical mechanics described by
the classical Hamiltonian a and
• the kernel K of the Feynman propagator operator (called the Feynman propaga-
tor kernel), and
• the kernel S of the Heisenberg scattering operator (called the scattering kernel).
In what follows, we will only use formal arguments. Let us ﬁrst discuss the physical
meaning of both the Feynman propagator operator and the Heisenberg scattering
operator.
The Feynman propagator operator. The operator
P(t, t0) := e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ,
t ≥t0
is called the Feynman propagator. For given initial state ψ0 ∈L2(R), the state
ψ(t) = P(t, t0)ψ0
is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation (7.262). From the physical point of view,
the propagator P(t, t0) sends the particle state ψ0 at the initial time t0 to the
particle state ψ(t) at time t. Therefore, the propagator describes the dynamics of
the quantum particle. Let
−∞< t0 < t1 < · · · < tN−1 < tN < ∞.
Then the addition theorem for the exponential function tells us that we have the
following operator product
P(tN, t0) = P(tN, tN−1) · · · P(t2, t1)P(t1, t0).
(7.264)
This product property reﬂects causality. To understand this, note that it follows
from ψ(t1) = P(t1, t0)ψ0 and ψ(t2) = P(t2, t1)ψ(t1) that
ψ(t2) = P(t2, t1)P(t1, t0)ψ0 = P(t2, t0)ψ0.
The propagator t →P(t, t0) satisﬁes the following equation
iℏPt(t, t0) = HP(t, t0),
t ≥t0,
P(t0, t0) = I,
(7.265)
which is called the propagator diﬀerential equation.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The Heisenberg scattering operator. Suppose that the Hamiltonian oper-
ator H is the perturbation of the free Hamiltonian Hfree according to (7.263). Let
us investigate scattering processes. The operator
S(t, t0) := eitHfree/ℏP(t, t0)e−it0Hfree/ℏ,
t ≥t0
with P(t, t0) := e−i(t−t0)H/ℏis called the Heisenberg scattering operator (or the
S-matrix operator). In order to understand the physical meaning of the scattering
operator, consider the free motion
ψfree,in(t) := e−itHfree/ℏϕin,
t ∈R
with the initial state ϕin at time t = 0, and
ψfree,out(t) := e−itHfree/ℏϕout,
t ∈R
with the initial state ϕout at time t = 0. The transition amplitude
τ := ⟨ψfree,out(t)|P(t, t0)ψfree,in(t0)⟩,
t > t0
is equal to
τ = ⟨ϕout|
“
e−itHfree/ℏ”†
P(t, t0)e−it0Hfree/ℏϕin⟩= ⟨ϕout|S(t, t0)ϕin⟩.
The real number
|τ|2 = |⟨ϕout|S(t, t0)ϕin⟩|2,
t > t0
(7.266)
is the transition probability from the incoming free state ψfree,in(t0) at time t0 to
the outgoing free state ψfree,out(t) at time t.
The transition probability (7.266)indexscattering matrix (S-matrix)!transition
probability is the key for computing cross sections of scattering processes
in particle accelerators.
We also deﬁne
⟨ϕout|Sϕin⟩:=
lim
t→+∞
lim
t0→−∞= ⟨ϕout|S(t, t0)ϕin⟩
if this limit exists. Here, the complex number ⟨ϕout|Sϕin⟩is called an S-matrix
element. Parallel to (7.264), we get the causal product relation
S(tN, t0) = S(tN, tN−1) · · · S(t2, t1)S(t1, t0).
(7.267)
Furthermore, we have the diﬀerential equation
iℏSt(t, t0) = κU(t)S(t, t0),
t ≥t0,
S(t0, t0) = I
(7.268)
for the scattering operator. Here, we introduce the transformed perturbation
U(t) := eitHfree/ℏUe−it0Hfree/ℏ.
Let us motivate (7.268). To simplify notation, choose ℏ:= 1. Then

7.13 Two Magic Formulas
611
iSt(t, t0) = −eitHfreeHfreeP(t, t0)e−it0Hfree + ieitHfreePt(t, t0)e−it0Hfree,
which is equal to
eitHfree(H −Hfree)P(t, t0)e−it0Hfree = κeitHfreeUe−it0HfreeS(t, t0).
Dyson’s magic S-matrix formula. Let us pass from diﬀerential equations to
integral equations. From the diﬀerential equation (7.268) for the scattering operator,
we get the equivalent Volterra integral equation
S(t, t0) = I −iκ
ℏ
Z t
t0
U(τ)S(τ, t0)dτ,
t ≥t0.
(7.269)
We have shown in Sect. 7.17.4 of Vol. I that the integral equation (7.269) has the
unique solution
S(t, t0) = T e−iκ
ℏ
R t
t0 U(τ)dτ,
t ≥t0
(7.270)
where T is the chronological operator (see page 382 of Vol. I). This is Dyson’s magic
S-matrix formula which plays the decisive role in the operator-theoretic approach to
quantum ﬁeld theory. Comparing the propagator equation (7.265) with the equation
(7.268) for the scattering operator, we get the following:
The scattering operator S(t, t0) coincides with the Feynman propagator
P(t, t0) in the Dirac interaction picture (with respect to the transformed
perturbation κU(t) of the Hamiltonian operator).122
This fact is of fundamental importance for understanding the S-matrix theory in
quantum ﬁeld theory.
The integral equation for states. For given ϕin ∈L2(R), introduce the
function ϕ(t) := S(t, t0)ϕin. By (7.269), we obtain the integral equation
ϕ(t) = ϕin −iκ
ℏ
Z t
t0
U(τ)ϕ(τ)dτ,
t ≥t0.
Let ϕ = ϕ(t) be a solution of this integral equation. Set ψ(t) := e−itHfree/ℏϕ(t) for
all t ≥t0. Then
ψ(t) = P(t, t0)e−it0Hfree/ℏϕin,
t ≥t0.
By the propagator equation (7.265), this is a solution of the Schr¨odinger equation
(7.262) with the initial condition ψ(t0) = ψfree,in = e−it0Hfree/ℏϕin.
7.13.1 The Formal Feynman Path Integral for the Propagator
Kernel
The dynamics of a quantum system is described by a time-dependent op-
erator called the Feynman propagator. The kernel of the propagator can
be formally represented by a Feynman path integral which depends on the
classical Hamiltonian (i.e., the symbol of the Hamiltonian operator). This
is the ﬁrst magic formula in quantum physics.

122 The Schr¨odinger picture, the Heisenberg picture, and the Dirac (or interaction)
picture are thoroughly discussed on page 393 of Vol. I.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Euler’s polygon method. Set tk := t0 + kΔt, k = 1, . . . , N and tN := t. This
way, we get the decomposition
t0 < t1 < . . . < tN−1 < tN
of the time interval [t0, t]. Let b : R →R be a given smooth function. We want to
solve the ordinary diﬀerential equation
ψ′(t) = b(t)ψ(t),
t ≥t0,
ψ(t0) = ψ0.
We are looking for a smooth solution ψ : R →R. This uniquely determined solution
is denoted by ψ(t) = P(t, t0)ψ0. Then
P(t, t0)ψ0 = P(tN, tN−1) · · · P(t2, t1)P(t1, t0)ψ0,
and Pt(t, t0)ψ0 = b(t)P(t, t0)ψ0 for all ψ0 ∈R. Hence Pt(t, t) = b(t). By Taylor
expansion, linearization of the propagator yields
P(tk+1, tk) = P(tk, tk) + Δt · Pt(tk, tk) + O((Δt)2),
Δt →0
with P(tk, tk) = 1 and Pt(tk, tk) = b(tk). Replacing the propagator by its lineariza-
tion, we obtain the approximate solution
ψΔt(t) = (1 + b(tN−1Δt)) · · · (1 + b(t1)Δt)(1 + b(t0)Δt)ψ0.
A standard result in numerical analysis tells us that this approximation method is
convergent, that is,
lim
Δt→0 ψΔt(t) = ψ(t),
t ≥t0.
For example, ﬁx the real number B, and set b(t) := B for all t. Then we get the
well-known classical formula for Euler’s exponential function:
lim
Δt→0 (1 + BΔt)N ψ0 = eB(t−t0)ψ0,
(7.271)
which is valid for all times t ∈R and all ψ0 ∈R.
A general approximation principle for the propagators of time-
depending processes. The argument above can be generalized to fairly general
time-depending processes. For example, the limit (7.271) exists on a Banach space X
for all ψ0 ∈X if B : X →X is a linear bounded operator. More general functional-
analytic results can be found in P. Lax, Functional Analysis, Sect. 34.3, Wiley, New
York, 2002.123 The situation is more subtle if B is an unbounded operator, as in
quantum mechanics. In what follows, we will only use formal arguments.
From the propagator to the kernel. Let K be the kernel of the Feynman
propagator operator P(t, t0) = e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ. Then the unique solution
ψ(t) = P(t, t0)ψ0
of the Schr¨odinger equation (7.262) on page 608 can be represented by the integral
formula
ψ(x, t) =
Z
R
K(x, t; y, t0)ψ0(y)dy,
x ∈R, t ≥t0.
It remains to compute the propagator kernel K. Our goal is the key formula (7.274)
below. The propagator possesses the linearization
123 The proof uses the uniform boundedness theorem in functional analysis.

P(tk+1, tk) = I −iΔt
ℏH + O((Δt))2,
Δt →0.
We set PΔt(tk+1, tk) := I−iΔt
ℏH. It follows from the causal product formula (7.264)
on page 609 together with the approximation principle above that
P(t, t0) = lim
Δt→0 PΔt(tN, tN−1) · · · PΔt(t1, t0).
Thus, we obtain
P(t, t0) = lim

(7.272)
From the kernel to the symbol. The Hamiltonian operator H has the symbol
a(q, p). Thus, the operator PΔt(tk+1, tk) has the symbol 1−iΔt
ℏa(q, p). By the kernel
formula (7.251) of the Weyl calculus on page 602, we obtain

denote the formal limit limN→∞SN. Then

all continuous paths q = q(τ), p = p(τ), t0 ≤τ ≤t, which satisfy the boundary
condition
q(t0) = y,
q(t) = x.
The magic formula (7.274) relates classical mechanics to quantum mechanics by
means of the classical action.
The crux with diﬀerentiable paths. The reader should note that the action
S[q, p] from (7.273) only makes sense if the path q = q(t), p = p(t) is suﬃciently
smooth. However, our formal argument above also takes highly irregular paths into
account, which are not diﬀerentiable at all. Such irregular paths are typical for
the Brownian motion of tiny particles immersed in a liquid. In fact, in Wiener’s
theory of Brownian motion, the probability is equal to one for the realization of
continuous, but not diﬀerentiable paths (see Sect. 7.11.4). Then the action S[q, p]
does not make any sense, in terms of classical analysis. This indicates that our
formal approach is not well deﬁned. Fortunately enough, it turns out that the main
contribution to the Feynman path integral (7.274) comes from the paths which
satisfy the classical equation of motion in mechanics. This is the main idea behind
the WKB approximation method (see Sect. 7.10).
The symbol of the Feynman propagator. Let symP (q, p ; t, t0) denote the
symbol of the propagator operator P(t, t0). By the kernel formula (7.252) of the
Weyl calculus on page 602, we get
symP (q, p ; t, t0) =
Z
R

for all q, p ∈R and all t ≥t0. Recall that the propagator kernel K(x, t; y, t0) can be
represented by the Feynman path integral (7.274) above.
7.13.2 The Relation between the Scattering Kernel and the
Propagator Kernel
In perturbation theory, the scattering of free quantum particles under the
action of a force is described by the Heisenberg scattering operator. The
kernel of the scattering operator can be represented by the propagator
kernel. This is the second magic formula in quantum physics.
Folklore
Let S be the kernel of the propagator operator S(t, t0). This means that the function
ϕ(t) := S(t, t0)ϕin can be represented by the integral formula

ϕ(x, t) =

R2 ϕout(x)S(x, t; y, t0)ϕin(y)dxdy,
which generates the crucial transition probability |⟨ϕout|S(t, t0)ϕin⟩|2 from (7.266).
It remains to compute the kernel S(x, t; y, t0). Our goal is the key formula (7.276)
below which relates the scattering kernel to the propagator kernel computed in the
preceding section. The point is that there exists a simple relation between the sym-
bol of the scattering operator and the symbol of the Feynman propagator operator.
By the Weyl calculus, this implies the desired relation between the scattering kernel
S(x, t; y, t0) and the Feynman propagator kernel K(x, t; y, t0).
The symbol of the scattering operator. Let symS(q, p ; t, t0) denote the
symbol of the scattering operator
S(t, t0) := eitHfree/ℏP(t, t0)e−it0Hfree/ℏ,
t ≥t0.
By the Weyl calculus, we have to replace this operator product by the Moyal star
product for the corresponding symbols. Note that e−itp2/2mℏis the symbol of the
free propagator e−itHfree/ℏ. Hence
symS(q, p ; t, t0) = eitp2/2mℏ∗symP (q, p ; t, t0) ∗e−it0p2/2mℏ.
Using formula (7.261) for the Moyal star product on page 607 together with the
associativity of the Moyal star product, we obtain the key relation for the symbols:
symS(q, p ; t, t0) =
Z
R2 A(q, p ; t, t0; q1, p1) symP (q1, p ; t, t0) dq1dp1.

The explicit computation of (7.276) will be performed in Problem 7.32. According
to (7.275), the symbol symP is given by a Feynman path integral which depends
on the classical action.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
7.14 The Poincar´e–Wirtinger Calculus
The Poincar´e–Wirtinger calculus reformulates real analysis in terms of the
language of complex analysis. This is very useful for modern quantum
theory.
Folklore
Let f : R2 →C be a smooth complex-valued function on the real plane R2. We set
z := x + iy,
¯z := x −iy,
and we write f(x, y) := u(x, y) + iv(x, y) where u : R2 →R is the real part and
v : R2 →R is the imaginary part of f. The main idea of the Poincar´e–Wirtinger
calculus is to introduce the following two diﬀerential operators:
∂
∂z := 1
2
„ ∂
∂x −i ∂
∂y
«
,
∂
∂¯z := 1
2
„ ∂
∂x + i ∂
∂y
«
.
(7.278)
This yields
∂f(x, y)
∂z
= 1
2(ux(x, y) + vy(x, y)) + i
2(vx(x, y) −uy(x, y)),
∂f(x, y)
∂¯z
= 1
2(ux(x, y) −vy(x, y)) + i
2(vx(x, y) + uy(x, y)).
Therefore, the following two conditions are equivalent:
(i)
∂f
∂¯z = 0 on R2.
(ii) ux = vy and uy = −vx on R2 (Cauchy–Riemann diﬀerential equations).
In this case, we say that the function f is holomorphic on R2. In terms of complex
function theory, this means that the function z →f(x, y) is holomorphic on the
complex plane C, in the classical sense. Similarly, the following two conditions are
equivalent:
(i)
∂f
∂z = 0 on R2.
(ii) ux = −vy and uy = vx on R2 (anti-Cauchy–Riemann diﬀerential equations).
In this case, we say that the function f is anti-holomorphic on R2. This is equivalent
to the fact that the function z →f(x, y)† is holomorphic on C.
Example. (a) For f(x, y) := x2 + y2, we get
∂f(x, y)
∂z
= x −iy,
∂f(x, y)
∂¯z
= x + iy.
The function f is neither holomorphic nor anti-holomorphic on R2.
(b) For f(x, y) := (x + iy)2, we get
∂f(x, y)
∂z
= 2(x + iy),
∂f(x, y)
∂¯z
= 0.
The function f is holomorphic on R2.
(c) For f(x, y) := (x −iy)2, we get
∂f(x, y)
∂¯z
= 2(x −iy),
∂f(x, y)
∂z
= 0.
The function f is anti-holomorphic on R2.

7.15 Bargmann’s Holomorphic Quantization
617
Mnemonic elegance. The results (a)–(c) above can be reformulated as follows.
(a) For f(x, y) = x2 + y2 = z¯z, we get
∂f(x, y)
∂z
= ¯z = x −iy,
∂f(x, y)
∂¯z
= z = x + iy.
(b) For f(x, y) := (x + iy)2 = z2, we get
∂f(x, y)
∂z
= 2z = 2(x + iy),
∂f(x, y)
∂¯z
= 0.
(c) For f(x, y) := (x −iy)2 = ¯z2, we get
∂f(x, y)
∂¯z
= 2¯z = 2(x −iy),
∂f(x, y)
∂z
= 0.
These results are formally obtained by considering f as a function of the two inde-
pendent variables z and ¯z and by using formal partial diﬀerentiation with respect
to z and ¯z.
For a general smooth function f : R2 →C, we proceed as follows. Using the
representations x = (z + ¯z)/2 and y = (z −¯z)/2i, we deﬁne
F(z, ¯z) := f
“z + ¯z
2
, z −¯z
2i
”
.
(7.279)
Considering formally the function F as a function of the independent variables z
and ¯z, the chain rule tells us that
∂F(z, ¯z)

holomorphic on C2. Then ∂f(x,y)

In later volumes, the Poincar´e–Wirtinger calculus will play a crucial role in studying
the following subjects: K¨ahler geometry, conformal ﬁeld theory, and string theory.
7.15 Bargmann’s Holomorphic Quantization
Our goal is to realize the commutation relation
a−a+ −a+a−= I
(7.280)
together with (a−)† = a+ by elementary operators on a Hilbert space B(C) of
holomorphic functions. The precise formulation will be given in Theorem 7.58 below.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
In terms of physics, the operator a+ (resp. a−) is a creation (resp. annihilation)
operator.125
The Bargmann–Fock space B(C). We start with the inner product
⟨F|G⟩:= 1
π
Z
R2 F(z)†G(z)e−zz†dxdy.
(7.281)
By deﬁnition, the space B(C) consists of all holomorphic functions F : C →C with
⟨F|F⟩< ∞. This is a complex Hilbert space with respect to the inner product
(7.281). The set of polynomials z →F(z) is a dense subset of B(C). We deﬁne the
operators a± : D(a±) →B(C) by setting
(a+F)(z) := zF(z)
for all
z ∈C,
and
(a−F)(z) := d
dz F(z)
for all
z ∈C.
More precisely, the domain of deﬁnition D(a±) of the operator a± consists of all
functions F ∈B(C) with a±F ∈B(C). For example, this is satisﬁed for all polyno-
mials F. Setting F0(z) := 1 for all z ∈C, we get ⟨F0|F0⟩= 1 and
a−F0 = 0.
In terms of physics, the function F0 is called the ground state (or the vacuum state).
This state does not contain any particles.
Theorem 7.58 (i) For all polynomials F ∈B(C), we get
(a−a+ −a+a−)F = F.
This is the precise formulation of the commutation relation (7.280) .
(ii) For all polynomials F, G ∈B(C), we get
⟨a−F|G⟩= ⟨F|a+G⟩.
This means that (a−)† = a+, in the sense of a formally adjoint operator.
Proof. Ad (i). Note that (a+a−F)(z) = zF ′(z) and
(a−a+F)(z) = (zF(z))′ = F(z) + zF ′(z).
Ad (ii). We will use the Poincar´e–Wirtinger calculus introduced on page 616. Recall
that ¯z := z†. Since G is holomorphic, ∂G(z)
∂¯z
= 0. By the product rule,
∂
∂¯z
`
G(z)e−z¯z´
= ∂G(z)
∂¯z
e−z¯z −G(z)ze−z¯z = −G(z)ze−z¯z.
125 The proofs can be found in the classical paper by V. Bargmann, On a Hilbert
space of analytic functions and an associated integral transform, Commun. Pure
and Appl. Math. 14 (1961), 187–214. See also the last chapter of the monograph
by F. Berezin and M. Shubin, The Schr¨odinger Equation, Kluwer, Dordrecht,
1991.
The basic idea goes back to V. Fock, Generalizing and solving Dirac’s statistical
equation, Z. Phys. 49 (1928), 339–357 (in German).

Orthonormal basis. The functions

form an orthonormal basis of the Hilbert space B(C). Explicitly, Fn(z) = zn/
√

for all z ∈C. In terms of physics, Fn represents a (normalized) state of n particles.
Intuitively, this state is generated from the vacuum state F0 by n-fold application
of the creation operator a+ to F0.
Wick operators. Let αkn be complex numbers for k, n = 0, . . . , m, where
m = 0, 1, . . . . For all polynomials z →F(z), deﬁne
AF :=

k,n=0
αkn(a+)k(a−)nF.
Note that the powers of the annihilation operator a−stand on the right. In particu-
lar, αkn(a+)k(a−)nF0 = 0 if n = 1, 2, . . .. The operators A are called Wick operators
on the Hilbert space B(C) (or normally ordered operators). The polynomial
symA(z, ζ) :=
m
X
k,n=0
αknzkζn
with respect to the complex variables z and ζ is called the symbol of the Wick
operator A. As we will show later on, Wick operators play a crucial role for de-
scribing physical quantities in quantum ﬁeld theory (e.g., collision processes) and
in quantum statistics (e.g., superﬂuidity and superconductivity).
The Bargmann–Fock space B(Cs). We want to apply the preceding con-
struction to s species of particles. To this end, we deﬁne ⟨F|G⟩by

where zk := xk + iyk, and xk, yk ∈R for all k = 1, . . . , s. By deﬁnition, the Fock–
Bargmann space B(Cs) consists of all holomorphic functions127
126 Note the following. Since
∂
∂z =

“

, the Gaussian integral theorem
transforms this integral into a boundary integral (over the sphere of radius R),
which goes to zero as R →∞.
127 This means that F : Cs →C is a power series expansion (with complex coeﬃ-
cients) which is absolutely convergent for all complex numbers z1, . . . , zs.

620
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
F : Cs →C
with ⟨F|F⟩< ∞. The space B(Cs) is a complex Hilbert space equipped with the
inner product ⟨F|G⟩. The set of polynomials (z1, . . . , zs) →F(z1, . . . , zs) (with com-
plex coeﬃcients) is a dense subset of B(Cs). Let k = 1, . . . , s. For all polynomials
F, deﬁne
(a+
k F)(z1, . . . , zs) := zkF(z1, . . . , zs), (a−
k F)(z1, . . . , zs) := ∂F(z1, . . . , zs)
∂zk
,
where z1, . . . , zs ∈C. Then, for all polynomials F and all j, k = 1, . . . , s, we have
the commutation relations
(a−

together with (a−

[a−

k ]−= [a+
j , a+
k ]−= 0, j, k = 1, . . . , s.
Moreover, for all polynomials F, G, we have
⟨a−
k F|G⟩= ⟨F|a+
k G⟩,
k = 1, . . . , s.
Hence (a−
k )† = a+
k for k = 1, . . . , s in the sense of formal adjoint operators.
In the monograph by L. Faddeev and A. Slavnov, Gauge Fields, Benjamin,
Reading, Massachusetts, 1980, it is emphasized that the Feynman path integral
based on Bargmann quantization is very convenient for studying the quantization
of the Standard Model in particle physics (Faddev–Popov quantization of gauge
theories). We will investigate this in Vol. V.
Application to the quantized harmonic oscillator. We want to show that
the use of Bargmann’s holomorphic quantization allows us immediately to obtain
the energy spectrum of the quantized harmonic oscillator. Motivated by Sect. 7.3.1
on page 443, we use the Hamiltonian
H = P 2
2m + mω2Q2

of the harmonic oscillator, and we set
Q := x0
√
2
(a+ + a−),
P :=

(a+ −a−)
with x0 :=

H = ℏω(a+a−+ 1
2).
Setting Fn(z) := zn, we get a+a−Fn = z d
dz Fn = nFn. Therefore, introducing
En := ℏω(n + 1
2), we obtain
HFn = EnFn,
n = 0, 1, . . .

7.16 The Stone–Von Neumann Uniqueness Theorem

7.16 The Stone–Von Neumann Uniqueness Theorem
The name “Heisenberg commutation relation” is a bit of a misnomer; the
relations were in fact ﬁrst formulated in their modern form not by Heisen-
berg (1925), but by Born and Jordan (1925) and by Dirac (1925) in the
one-dimensional case and in the “Dreim¨annerarbeit” (three-man work) by
Born, Heisenberg and Jordan (1926) and by Dirac (1926) in the multi-
dimensional case. However, it is true that they grew out of the original
ground-breaking work of Heisenberg (1925), though one would have to
examine Heisenberg’s paper very carefully to ﬁnd anything remotely sug-
gesting the commutation relations.128
Jonathan Rosenberg, 2004
In this chapter, we have based quantum mechanics on the Born–Heisenberg–Jordan
commutation relation
QP −PQ = iℏI.
(7.282)
We want to show that, in an appropriate sense, the construction of the the-
ory is unique. That is, each realization of quantum mechanics is equivalent to
Schr¨odinger’s approach. This follows from the Stone–von Neumann uniqueness the-
orem below. Moreover, we want to show that this problem is closely related to
the following mathematical topics: functional analysis (operator theory on Hilbert
spaces), symplectic geometry, C∗-algebras, functors between categories (the Weyl
quantization functor), Lie algebras (the Heisenberg algebra) and Lie groups (the
Heisenberg group). The main trick is to replace (7.282) by the Weyl relation (7.283)
below. This way, we circumvent the technical subtlety related to the fact that the
operators Q and P are not deﬁned on the total Hilbert space. The Weyl relation
refers to the unitary operators U(a) = eiaP/ℏand V (b) = eibQ deﬁned on the to-
tal Hilbert space. Here, a and b are real parameters. This exponentiation is an
inﬁnite-dimensional variant of the passage from Lie algebras to Lie groups.
7.16.1 The Prototype of the Weyl Relation
Prototype. Consider the motion of a quantum particle on the real line. Choose the
real numbers a and b. For each wave function ψ ∈L2(R), we deﬁne the translation
operator
(U(a)ψ)(x) := ψ(x + a),
x ∈R,
and the phase operator
(V (b)ψ)(x) := eibxψ(x),
x ∈R.
Then, we have the so-called Weyl relation129
128 See the references given on page 673ﬀ. The fascinating (and surprising) discov-
ery of the commutation relation by Born after reading Heisenberg’s paper is
described on page 64 of Vol. I.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
U(a)V (b) = eiabV (b)U(a)
for all
a, b ∈R.
(7.283)
In fact, (U(a)V (b)ψ)(x) = U(a)(eibxψ(x)). This is equal to
eib(x+a)ψ(x + a) = eiabV (b)U(a)ψ(x).
Using the notion of strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group introduced
on page 506, the following holds:
{U(a)}a∈R and {V (b)}b∈R are strongly continuous one-parameter unitary
groups on the Hilbert space L2(R).
The Born–Heisenberg–Jordan commutation relation. Let the operators
Q : D(Q) →L2(R) and P : D(P) →L2(R) be the self-adjoint position and
momentum operator, respectively, introduced in Sect. 7.6.4 on page 518. Then, for
any test function ψ ∈S(R), we get
Pψ(x) = −iℏd
dxψ(x) = −iℏd
daU(a)ψ(x)|a=0
and
Qψ(x) = xψ(x) = −i d
dbV (b)ψ(x)|b=0.
Diﬀerentiating successively the Weyl relation
(U(a)V (b) −eiabV (b)U(a))ψ(x) = 0
with respect to the parameter a at the point a = 0 and with respect to b at b = 0,
we get
(QP −PQ)ψ = iℏψ.
(7.284)
Therefore, the Born–Heisenberg–Jordan commutation relation (7.284) can be re-
garded as the inﬁnitesimal variant of the Weyl relation (7.283). In terms of the
Stone theorem on page 506,
U(a) = eiaP/ℏ,
V (b) = eibQ,
a, b ∈R.
The Heisenberg algebra AHeis. Consider the linear operators
Q, P, ℏiI : S(R) →S(R).
Explicitly, (Qψ)(x) := xψ(x), (Pψ)(x) := −iℏd
dxψ(x), and ℏiIψ(x) := ℏiψ(x) for
all x ∈R and all ψ ∈S(R). Set
AHeis := {aQ + bP + cℏiI : a, b, c ∈R}.
This is a 3-dimensional real Lie algebra with respect to the following Lie products130
[Q, P]−= ℏiI,
[Q, ℏiI]−= [P, ℏiI]−= 0.
Trivially, we have [Q, Q]−= [P, P]−= [ℏiI, ℏiI]−= 0. This Lie algebra is called
the Heisenberg Lie algebra (or brieﬂy the Heisenberg algebra).
The realization of the Heisenberg algebra as a matrix Lie algebra. Let
us introduce the matrices
130 Recall that [A, B]−:= AB −BA.

form a group (with respect to matrix multiplication). This Lie group is denoted by
SUT(3, R) (group of special upper triangular real (3 × 3)-matrices).
The Lie algebra of the Lie group SUT(3, R) is equal to sut(3, R).
For more details, we refer to both Sec. 7.6ﬀof Vol. I and to Baker (2002).
The universal enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg algebra. Again
consider the operators Q, P, ℏiI : S(R) →S(R). Let E(AHeis) denote the set of all
polynomials in Q, P and ℏiI with complex coeﬃcients. For example, the operator
aℏiI + bP 3 + cP 2Q + dQP
with complex coeﬃcients a, b, c, d is an element of E(AHeis).
• The set E(AHeis) is a complex algebra (with respect to the sum and the product
of operators).
• If A, B ∈AHeis, then A, B ∈E(AHeis) and [A, B]−= AB −BA.
That is, the Lie product [., .]−on AHeis can be represented by using the product
on E(AHeis). In terms of the general theory of Lie algebras, the algebra E(AHeis) is
called the universal enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg Lie algebra AHeis.
The Weyl system with respect to the symplectic form ω on the plane
R2. For all (a, b) ∈R2, deﬁne
W(a, b) := e−i
2 abU(a)V (b).
(7.285)
Then, for all (a, b), (c, d) ∈R2, the following hold:
(i) W(a, b)W(b, c) = e
i
2 ω(a,b;c,d)W(a + c, b + d). Here, we set

Note that ω is the symplectic form on the plane R2.

624
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
(ii) W(a, b)† = W(−a, −b) and W(0, 0) = I.
The operator family {W(a, b)}(a,b)∈R2 is called the Weyl system of R2. One checks
easily that (7.283), (7.285) imply (i) and (ii). For example, we have
W(a, b)† = e
i
2 abV (b)†U(a)† = e
i
2 abV (−b)U(−a)
= e−i
2 abU(−a)V (−b) = W(−a, −b).
Conversely, if W is given, then we set U(a) := W(a, 0) and V (b) := W(0, b). Then
(i), (ii) imply (7.283), (7.285).
The Weyl algebra of the Hilbert space L2(R). The linear continuous oper-
ators A : L2(R) →L2(R) form a C∗-algebra A. The C∗-subalgebra of A generated
by {W(a, b) : (a, b) ∈R2} is called the Weyl algebra of the Hilbert space L2(R) (see
page 628).
The Heisenberg group GHeis. For all a, b, λ ∈R, modify the Weyl system by
setting
H(a, b, λ) := eiλW(a, b),
a, b, λ ∈R.
Then, for all a, b, c, d, λ, μ ∈R, we have the product formula
H(a, b, λ)H(c, d, μ) = H
`
a + c, b + d, λ + μ + 1
2ω(a, b; c, d)
´
.
This means that the set {H(a, b, λ)}a,b,λ∈R forms a group H. The space R3 is a
group with respect to the product
(a, b, λ)(c, d, μ) := (a + c, b + d, λ + μ)
for all (a, b, λ), (c, d, μ) ∈R3. If we modify this product by setting
(a, b, λ)(c, d, μ) :=
`
a + c, b + d, λ + μ + 1
2ω(a, b; c, d)
´
,
then R3 becomes a group which is called the Heisenberg group GHeis.131 The addi-
tional term 1
2ω(a, b; c, d) is called a twist. There exists a group epimorphism132
χ : GHeis →H
given by the map (a, b, λ) →H(a, b, λ).
The Heisenberg group GHeis is a 3-dimensional Lie group whose Lie algebra
is the Heisenberg algebra AHeis.
Since the Heisenberg group GHeis is arcwise connected and simply connected, it
represents the universal covering Lie group of the Heisenberg Lie algebra AHeis.
By the general theory of Lie groups, the universal covering Lie group Guniversal of
a given Lie algebra L knows everything about all of the Lie groups G whose Lie
algebra is equal to L.
The Heisenberg group is isomorphic to the group SUT(3, R).
131 The deﬁnition of the Heisenberg group is not unique in the literature. The Heisen-
berg group is also called the Weyl group in the physical literature. In fact, the
Heisenberg group never appears in the papers written by Heisenberg; this group
was introduced by Weyl.
132 A surjective (resp. injective) group morphism is called group epimorphism (resp.
group monomorphism). The same is true for rings. The general deﬁnition of
epimorphisms and monomorphisms in terms of category theory will be considered
in Vol. IV.

Central extensions of groups. Let G be a group. The set of all elements A
of G with the property that
AB = BA
for all
B ∈G
is called the center C(G) of the group G. The center C(G) is a normal subgroup of
G. The group G is said to be a central extension of the quotient group G/C(G).133
For the Heisenberg group,
C(GHeis) := {(0, 0, λ) : λ ∈R}.
This center is isomorphic to the additive group R. The map
(a, b, λ) →(a, b)
is a group morphism from the Heisenberg group GHeis onto the additive group R2.
The kernel of the unit element (0, 0) of R2 is the center C(GHeis). Therefore, we
have the group isomorphism
GHeis/C(GHeis) ≃R2.
Consequently, the Heisenberg group GHeis is a central extension of the additive
group R2.
Central extensions of Lie algebras. Let X be a linear space. Introducing
the Lie product [A, B] := 0 for all A, B ∈X, we obtain the trivial Lie algebra X.
In this sense, the linear spaces Rn (n = 1, 2, . . .) become trivial Lie algebras.
Let L be a Lie algebra. The set of all elements A of L with the property that
[A, B] = 0
for all
B ∈L
is called the center C(L) of L. The center C(L) is an ideal of L. The Lie algebra L is
said to be a central extension of the quotient Lie algebra L/C(L).134 For example,
the center of the Heisenberg algebra is given by
C(AHeis) = {cℏiI : c ∈R}.
This center is isomorphic to R. The map
aQ + bP + cℏiI →(a, b)
is a Lie algebra morphism from the Heisenberg algebra AHeis onto the trivial Lie
algebra R2. The kernel of the zero element (0, 0) of R2 is the center C(AHeis).
Therefore, we have the Lie algebra isomorphism
AHeis/C(AHeis) ≃R2.
133 More general, if H is a subgroup of C(G), then the quotient group G/H is called
a central extension of the group G by the group H.
134 More general, if J is a subalgebra of C(L), then the Lie algebra L is called a
central extension of the Lie algebra L/J by the Lie algebra J .

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Consequently, the Heisenberg algebra AHeis is a central extension of the trivial Lie
algebra R2.
Central extensions of Lie groups and Lie algebras play an important role in
quantum physics (e.g., the Bargmann theorem on the lifting of projective quantum
symmetries to unitary symmetries, and the Virasoro algebra in both conformal
quantum ﬁeld theory and string theory). As an introduction, we recommend M.

7.16.2 The Main Theorem
Theorem 7.59 Let {U(a)}a∈R and {V(b)}b∈R be strongly continuous one-parame-
ter unitary groups on the complex separable non-trivial Hilbert space X.135 Suppose
that the Weyl relation
U(a)V(b) = eiabV(b)U(a)
for all
a, b ∈R
is satisﬁed. Then the operators U(a) (resp. V(b)) are unitarily equivalent to direct
sums of translation (resp. phase) operators on L2(R).
More precisely, the following hold.
(i) Invariant subspaces: There exists a ﬁnite or countable family X1, X2, . . . of
pairwise orthogonal, closed, linear subspaces of the Hilbert space X with the direct
sum decomposition
X =
M
k
Xk.
All of the spaces X1, X2, . . . are invariant under the operators U(a) and V(b).
(ii) Unitary equivalence: For all a, b ∈R, the operator U(a) (resp. V(b)) is
unitarily equivalent to the translation operator U(a) (resp. the phase operator V (b))
on the Hilbert space L2(R) introduced on page 622. This means that there exist
unitary operators Uk : Xk →L2(R) such that, for all k, the following diagram is
commutative:
Xk
Uk

U(a)
 Xk
Uk

L2(R)
U(a)  L2(R).
The same is true if we replace U(a) and U(a) by V(b) and V (b), respectively.
The proof can be found in Putnam (1967), p. 65. Theorem 7.59 is called the
Stone–von Neumann uniqueness theorem. This theorem was announced by Stone
in 1930. The ﬁrst proof was given by
J. von Neumann, On the uniqueness of the Schr¨odinger operators, Math.

7.16.3 C∗-Algebras
A crucial strategy in modern mathematical physics consists in using
C∗-algebras.
Folklore
The simplest case of a C∗-algebra is the set C of complex numbers equipped with
the operations z + w, zw, z†, and |z|. Since zw = wz, this C∗-algebra is called
commutative.
Let n = 2, 3, . . . The prototype of a (noncommutative) C∗-algebra is the set of
complex (n × n)-matrices equipped with the operations A + B, AB, A† (adjoint
matrix), αA (α ∈C), and ||A|| :=
p
tr(AA†) (norm). The unit matrix I is the unit
element. Traditionally, instead of A† and z† we write A∗and z∗, respectively.
Deﬁnition of C∗-algebra. Let A be a complex associative algebra which is
also a complex Banach space. In addition, suppose that there exists a map A →A∗
(called the ∗-map) such that the following hold for all A, B ∈A and all complex
numbers α, β:
(i) A∗∈A (adjoint element);
(ii) (αA + βB)∗= α†A∗+ β†B∗(the ∗-map is antilinear);
(iii) (A∗)∗= A (the ∗-map is an involution);
(iv) (AB)∗= B∗A∗;
(iv) ||AB|| ≤||A|| · ||B||;
(v) ||A∗|| = ||A|| and ||A∗A|| = ||A||2.
Then A is called a C∗-algebra.
The C∗-algebra is called commutative iﬀAB = BA for all A, B ∈A. Further-
more, the C∗-algebra is called unital iﬀthere exists a unit element I of A with
||I|| = 1.
C∗-subalgebra. A subset S of a C∗-algebra A is called a C∗-subalgebra of A
iﬀit is a C∗-algebra with respect to the operations on A.
If S is a subset of a C∗-algebra A, then there exists a (uniquely determined)
smallest C∗-subalgebra B of A which contains the set S. Explicitly, B is the in-
tersection of all C∗-subalgebras of A which contain the set S. We say that B is
generated by S.
By deﬁnition, a C∗-ideal of the C∗-algebra A is a C∗-subalgebra I of A which
has the additional property that AB ∈I and BA ∈I for all A ∈A, B ∈I.
Examples. (a) The function space C(M). Let M be a nonempty compact
separated topological space (e.g. M = [0, 1] or, more generally, M is a compact
subset of Rn, n = 1, 2, . . . ). The space C(M) of all continuous functions
f : M →C
is a unital C∗-algebra with respect to the norm
||f|| := max
x∈M |f(x)|.
Moreover, we set f ∗(x) := f(x)† for all x ∈M (complex-conjugate function). The
function f(x) := 1 for all x ∈M is the unit element of C(M).
(b) The operator space L(X, X). Let X be a complex Hilbert space. The space
L(X, X) of all linear continuous operators
A : X →X
is a C∗-algebra with respect to the operator norm

628
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
||A|| :=
sup
||ψ||≤1
||Aψ||
and A∗:= A† (adjoint operator). If X ̸= {0}, then the C∗-algebra L(X, X) is
unital, where the unit operator I is the unit element.
(c) The Weyl algebra of the Hilbert space L2(R). Let X := L2(R). The smallest
C∗-subalgebra of L(X, X), which contains the Weyl operators W(a, b), a, b ∈R, is
called the Weyl algebra of L2(R). Explicitly, this is the closure of the set
span{W(A, B) : a, b ∈R}.
The closure is to be understood in the sense of the Banach space L(X, X).
The Gelfand–Naimark theorem below shows that examples (a) and (b) above
are typical for C∗-algebras and commutative C∗-algebras, respectively.
C∗-morphism. Let A and B be C∗-algebras. The map
χ : A →B
is called a C∗- morphism iﬀit respects the algebra structure, the ∗-operation, and
the norm structure, that is, for all A, B ∈A and all complex numbers α, β, we have
• χ(αA + βB) = αχ(A) + βχ(B),
• χ(AB) = χ(A)χ(B),
• χ(A)∗= χ(A), and
• ||χ(A)|| = ||A||.
Bijective C∗-morphisms are called C∗-isomorphisms. Moreover, C∗-isomorphisms
χ : A →A from a C∗-algebra A onto itself, are called C∗-automorphisms.
The category of C∗-algebras. In order to describe the common features of
mathematical structures, one uses categories in mathematics. A category consists
of objects and morphisms.
• The objects of the category of C∗-algebras are the C∗-algebras,
• and the morphisms of the category of C∗-algebras are the C∗-morphisms.
The general setting of category theory will be investigated in Vol. IV on quantum
mathematics.
The Gelfand–Naimark structure theorem. In 1943, Gelfand (born 1913)
and Naimark (1909–1978) proved the following crucial result.
Theorem 7.60 (i) Each C∗-algebra is C∗-isomorphic to some C∗-subalgebra of
L(X, X), where X is some Hilbert space.
(ii) Each commutative unital C∗-algebra A is C∗-isomorphic to a C∗-algebra
C(M) of continuous functions on some nonempty compact separated topological
space M. Here, M is the space of maximal ideals of the algebra A equipped with an
appropriate topology.
The proof is based on the so-called Gelfand–Naimark–Segal (GNS) construction,
which is basic for algebraic quantum ﬁeld theory and quantum statistics.136 This
will be considered in Vol. IV. There, we will also show that (ii) above is crucial for
the spectral theory of unitary and self-adjoint operators. For the proofs, we refer

operators in Hilbert space, Mat. Sbornik 12 (1943), 197–213.

∗-Algebras. Sometimes it is convenient to replace C∗-algebras by the weaker
notion of ∗-algebra (star algebra). Here, all the properties of a C∗-algebra drop out
which refer to the norm. For example, the complex associative algebra A is called a
∗-algebra iﬀconditions (i)–(iv) on page 627 are satisﬁed. Analogously, one obtains
the following terms: ∗-subalgebra, ∗-morphism, ∗-isomorphism, ∗-automorphism,
category of ∗-algebras.
7.16.4 Operator Ideals
In order to give the proof for special cases of Fermat’s last theorem in number
theory, Kummer (1810–1891) introduced so-called ideal numbers.137 Generalizing
this, Dedekind (1831–1916) created the theory of ideals in ring theory. The theory
of operator ideals generalizes this to operator algebras.
Compact operators. Let C : X →X be a linear compact self-adjoint operator
on the complex separable non-trivial Hilbert space X. Then the eigenvectors of C
form a complete orthonormal system in X. Let λ1, λ2, . . . denote the eigenvalues of
C. Then:
• The spectrum of C is a pure point spectrum.
• The operator C is called of trace class iﬀP
n |λn| < ∞. In this case, the trace
tr(C) := P
n λn is ﬁnite. Operators of trace class are also called nuclear operators.
• The operator C is called a Hilbert–Schmidt operator iﬀP
n λ2
n < ∞.
Let us generalize this. The linear compact operator A : X →X is called a trace
class (resp. Hilbert–Schmidt) operator iﬀtr(
√
A∗A) < ∞(resp. tr(A∗A) < ∞).138
Every trace class operator is a Hilbert–Schmidt operator. If the linear operator
A : X →X is compact on the complex separable Hilbert space X, then there
exist orthogonal systems ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . and ψ1, ψ2, . . . together with positive numbers
μ1, μ2, . . . (called the singular values of the operator A) such that
Aϕ =
X
n
μn⟨ϕn|ϕ⟩ψn
for all
ϕn ∈X.
Explicitly, we choose a complete orthonormal system ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . of eigenvectors of
the self-adjoint compact operator A∗A, that is, A∗Aϕn = λnϕn. Here, λn ≥for all
n. Moreover, throw away the eigenvectors ϕm with λm = 0, and set μn := √λn, as
well as ψn := λ−1
n Aϕn. Equivalently, we write
A =
X
n
μnψn ⊗ϕn.
C∗-operator ideals. Consider the C∗-algebra L(X, X) of the linear continuous
operators A : X →X on the complex separable Hilbert space X.
(i) The set of linear compact operators A : X →X forms a C∗-ideal of L(X, X).
This ideal is denoted by Icompact.
137 The famous complete proof of Fermat’s last theorem was given by Wiles in 1994
(see page 17 of the Prologue to Vol. I; we also refer to F. Diamond and J.
Shurman, A First Course in Modular Forms, Springer, Berlin, 2005).
138 Note that the operator A∗A is self-adjoint and compact, and its eigenvalues are
nonnegative.

630
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
(ii) The trace-class operators A : X →X form a C∗-ideal of L(X, X). This ideal
is denoted by Itrace class.
(iii) The Hilbert–Schmidt operators of A : X →X form a C∗-ideal of L(X, X).
This ideal is denoted by IHilbert−Schmidt. We have the inclusions Itrace class ⊆
IHilbert−Schmidt ⊆Icompact ⊆L(X, X).
(iv) A ∈Itrace class iﬀA = BC with B, C ∈IHilbert−Schmidt.
For more details, we refer to M. Reed and B. Simon, Methods of Modern Math-
ematical Physics, Vol. I, Sects. VI.5ﬀ, Academic Press, 1972, as well as to the
monographs by R. Schatten, Norm Ideals of Completely Continuous Operators,
Springer, Berlin, 1960, and by A. Pietsch (1978), (2007) quoted on page 601.
7.16.5 Symplectic Geometry and the Weyl Quantization Functor
Functors play a crucial role in modern mathematics and physics.
Folklore
Symplectic linear spaces. A symplectic linear space X is a real linear space
equipped with a symplectic form
ω : X × X →R.
That is, for all a, b, c ∈X and all real numbers α, β, the following hold:
• ω(a, b) = −ω(b, a) (antisymmetry);
• ω(αa + βb, c) = αω(a, c) + βω(b, c) (bilinearity);
• ω(a, v) = 0 for all v ∈X implies a = 0 (non-degeneracy).
For example, the space R2 is a symplectic linear space with respect to the symplectic
form
ω((a, b), (c, d)) :=
˛˛˛˛˛
a b
c d
˛˛˛˛˛ = ad −bc,
(a, b), (c, d) ∈R2.
(7.286)
Symplectic morphism. Let X and Y be symplectic linear spaces with the
symplectic forms ω and μ, respectively. The map
χ : X →Y
is called a symplectic morphism iﬀit is linear and respects the symplectic forms,
that is,
μ(χ(a), χ(b)) = ω(a, b)
for all
a, b ∈X.
Bijective symplectic morphisms are called symplectic isomorphisms. Then the in-
verse map is also a symplectic morphism. For example, a symplectic isomorphism
of the plane R2 onto itself (with respect to the symplectic form (7.286)) is a linear
area-preserving map from R2 onto itself. The category of symplectic linear spaces
is deﬁned in the following way:
• The objects are symplectic linear spaces,
• and the morphisms are symplectic morphisms.
Weyl algebras. We want to generalize the Weyl algebra of the Hilbert space
L2(R). Let X be a linear symplectic space, and let A be a C∗-algebra with unit
element. The map
W : X →A
is called a Weyl map iﬀthe following hold for all a, b ∈X:

7.16 The Stone–Von Neumann Uniqueness Theorem
631
(i) W(a)W(b) = e
i
2 ω(a,b)W(a + b);
(ii) W(0) = I;
(iii) W(a)∗= W(−a).
The subset {W(a) : a ∈X} of the C∗-algebra A is called a Weyl system. The
smallest C∗-algebra of A which contains a Weyl system is called a Weyl algebra
W(X). This algebra is also called the CCR-algebra of the linear symplectic space
X with the symplectic form ω. Here, ‘CCR’ stands for ‘canonical commutation
relation’.
The existence and uniqueness theorem for Weyl algebras. The following
theorem generalizes the Stone–von Neumann uniqueness theorem.
Theorem 7.61 For each symplectic linear space X, there exists a Weyl algebra
W(X) which is unique, up to C∗-isomorphisms.
Proof. (I) Existence. Let l2(X) denote the space of all functions f : X →C with
at most countable support139 and the property that
X
a∈X
|f(a)|2 < ∞.
The complex linear space l2(X) becomes a complex Hilbert space equipped with
the inner product ⟨f|g⟩:= P
a∈X f(a)†g(a).
Now let us choose the C∗-algebra A consisting of all the linear continuous
operators A : l2(X) →l2(X). For all f ∈l2(X), we deﬁne
(W(a)f)(b) := e−i
2 ω(a,b)f(a + b),
a, b ∈X.
One checks directly that W(a) ∈A and that W : X →A is a Weyl map. To
ﬁnish the argument, let W(X) be the C∗-subalgebra of A generated by the set
{W(a) : a ∈X}.
(II) Uniqueness. See B¨ar et al (2007), p. 121 (see the reference on page 632). 2
Theorem 7.62 If σ : X →Y is a symplectic morphism between the symplectic lin-
ear spaces X and Y , then there exists a uniquely determined injective C∗-morphism
W(σ) : W(X) →W(Y ) such that the following diagram is commutative:
X

σ
 Y

W(X)
W(σ)  W(Y ).
For the proof, we refer to B¨ar et al. (2007), p. 122.
The Weyl quantization functor. We have the following two properties:
(F1) W(τ ◦σ) = W(τ) ◦W(σ);
(F2) W(id) = id.
139 This means that the function f vanishes outside an at most countable subset of
the linear space X.

632
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
More precisely, this means the following. If
X
σ
−→Y
τ
−→Z
is the composition of two symplectic morphisms σ and τ, then this is transformed
into the composition
W(X)
W(σ)
−→W(Y )
W(τ)
−→W(Z)
of the corresponding C∗-morphisms W(σ) and W(τ). Furthermore, the identical
symplectomorphism
X
id
−→X
is transformed into the identical map
W(X)
id
−→W(X)
of the C∗-algebra W(X). In terms of mathematics, the situation (F1), (F2) above
describes a functor W between the category of symplectic linear spaces and the
category of C∗-algebras. This functor is called the Weyl quantization functor.
Perspectives. In general, functors between categories map objects to objects
and morphisms to morphisms such that the two properties (F1), (F2) above are
satisﬁed. Functors play a fundamental role in the modern theory of mathematical
structures. Typical examples are:
• the homology functor which sends continuous maps between topological spaces
to group morphisms between homology groups,
• and the de Rham cohomology cofunctor140 which sends smooth maps between
manifolds to group morphisms between cohomology groups (i.e. linear maps be-
tween real linear spaces).
This will be studied in later volumes.
It was discovered recently, that functors are the right tool in order to gener-
alize Einstein’s principle of general relativity (also called the covariance principle)
to quantum ﬁeld theories on curved space-times. This principle postulates that
physics does not depend on the choice of observers. Roughly speaking, the basic
idea is to assign C∗-algebras to the open subsets of globally hyperbolic space-time
manifolds (realization of the Haag–Kastler axioms). The point is that the change
of the space-time manifolds induces a natural change of the assigned C∗-algebras.
Furthermore, two diﬀerent quantization functors are related to each other by a
natural transformation. We refer to:
R. Brunetti, K. Fredenhagen, and R. Verch, The generally covariant local-
ity principle – a new paradigm for local quantum ﬁeld theory, Commun.
Math. Phys. 237 (2003), 31–68.
C. B¨ar, N. Ginoux, and F. Pf¨aﬄe, Wave Equations on Lorentzian Mani-
folds and Quantization, European Mathematical Society 2007.
J. Baez and J. Dolan, Categoriﬁcation, Contemporary Mathematics 230
(1998), 1–36.
The monograph by B¨ar, Ginoux, and Pf¨aﬄe contains a detailed study of the initial-
value problem for normally hyperbolic diﬀerential equations on globally hyperbolic
manifolds, together with applications to quantum ﬁeld theory. This sophisticated
global theory due to Jacques Hadamard (1865–1963), Marcel Riesz (1886–1969) and
Jean Leray (1906–1998) is based on modern diﬀerential geometry (the language of
bundles) and the theory of distributions on manifolds. Distributions are needed in
order to handle the strong singularities of the Green’s functions.
140 In contrast to the composition rule (F2) above, a cofunctor F is characterized
by the reverse composition rule F(τ ◦σ) = F(σ) ◦F(τ).

7.17 A Glance at the Algebraic Approach to Quantum
Physics
In this section, we want to discuss a few basic ideas about the algebraic approach
to non-relativistic quantum physics. Further material can be found in the volumes
to follow. The Haag–Kastler theory, that is, the relativistic approach based on local
operator algebras will be studied in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics.
7.17.1 States and Observables
The states and the observables are basic concepts in the description of a
physical system and their description has undergone a drastic fundamental
change in the transition from the classical theory to the quantum theory.141
Huzihiro Araki, 1999
The prototypes of pure states and mixed states. Consider a complex non-
trivial Hilbert space X.
(a) Pure state: Fix ψ ∈X with ||ψ|| = 1. Deﬁne
χ(A) := ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩
for all
A ∈L(X, X).
Then χ(I) = 1, and χ(A∗A) = ⟨ψ|A∗Aψ⟩= ⟨Aψ|Aψ⟩≥0. Moreover, we have
χ(A)† = ⟨Aψ|ψ⟩= ⟨ψ|A∗ψ⟩= χ(A∗).
We call the linear continuous functional χ : L(X, X) →C a vector state (or a
pure state).
(b) Mixed state: Let ψ0, ψ1, . . . be a complete orthonormal system of the Hilbert
space X, and let p0, p1, . . . be real numbers contained in the unit interval [0, 1[
such that P
k pk = 1. Deﬁne142
χ(A) :=
X
k
pk⟨ψk|Aψk⟩
for all
A ∈L(X, X).
Again, χ(I) = 1 and χ(A∗A) ≥0 together with χ(A)† = χ(A∗) for all op-
erators A ∈L(X, X). The linear continuous functional χ : L(X, X) →C is
called a mixed state. In terms of physics, the pure state ψk is realized with the
probability pk.
(c) Dynamics. If H : D(H) →X is a linear self-adjoint Hamiltonian operator,
then the dynamics of the initial state ψ0 is given by ψ(t) = U(t)ψ0 for all times
t ∈R, where we set
U(t) := e−itH/ℏ,
t ∈R.
Motivated by ⟨U(t)ψ0|AU(t)ψ0⟩= ⟨ψ0|U(t)−1AU(t)ψ0⟩, we deﬁne the operator
Ut : L(X, X) →L(X, X) for all t ∈R by setting
UtA := U(t)−1AU(t).
141 H. Araki, Mathematical Theory of Quantum Fields, Oxford University Press,
1999.
142 Since |⟨ψk|Aψk⟩| ≤||ψk||·||Aψk|| ≤||ψk||·||A||·||ψk|| ≤||A||, the series for χ(A)
is convergent.

634
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
The operator Ut is a C∗-isomorphism from the C∗-algebra L(X, X) onto itself.
As usual, such C∗-isomorphisms are also called C∗-automorphisms. Deﬁne
χt(A) := χ(UtA)
for all
A ∈L(X, X), t ∈R.
Then the map t →χt corresponds to the map t →U(t)ψ0, which describes the
time evolution of the state ψ0.
The general deﬁnition in terms of C∗-algebras. Suppose that we are given
a C∗-algebra A with unit element I.
(i) Observables: The self-adjoint elements A of A (i.e., A∗= A) are called observ-
ables. The C∗-algebra A is called the extended algebra of observables.143
(ii) States: The linear functionals χ : A →C with the normalization condition
χ(I) = 1 and the positivity condition
χ(A∗A) ≥0
for all
A ∈A
are called states.144 A state is called mixed iﬀthere exist two diﬀerent states
χ1 and χ2 such that
χ = λχ1 + (1 −λ)χ2
for some number λ ∈]0, 1[.
Otherwise the state is called pure.
(iii) Measurements of an observable. Let A be an observable, and let χ be a state.
The real number
¯A := χ(A)
is called the measured mean value of the observable A in the state χ. Similarly,
the nonnegative number ΔA given by
(ΔA)2 := χ((A −¯A)2)
is the measured ﬂuctuation of the observable A in the state χ.145 If A and B
are two observables, then the complex number
γ := χ
`
(A −¯A)(B −¯B)
´
ΔA ΔB
is called the correlation coeﬃcient in the state χ.146
(iv) Dynamics: By deﬁnition, a dynamics on A is a one-parameter group {Ut}t∈R of
C∗-automorphisms of the algebra A. Explicitly, this means that, for all times
t, s ∈R, the map Ut : A →A is a C∗-automorphism and
Ut+s = UtUs,
U0 = id.
This yields the time evolution t →χt of a state χ, namely, we deﬁne
χt(A) := χ(UtA))
for all
A ∈A, t ∈R.
143 Note that the algebra A also contains elements which are not observables, in the
sense of the deﬁnition given above.
144 It can be shown that states are always continuous. We also have χ(A)† = χ(A∗)
for all A ∈A. In particular, if A is an observable, then χ(A) is real.
145 Since (A −¯A)∗= A −¯A, we get χ
`
(A −¯A
´2) ≥0, by (ii).
146 The Schwarz inequality for C∗-algebras tells us that |γ| ≤1.

7.17 A Glance at the Algebraic Approach to Quantum Physics
635
(v) Thermodynamical equilibrium states (KMS-states): Let β := 1/kT, where k is
the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. By deﬁnition, the
state χ is called a KMS-state of temperature T with respect to the dynamics
{Ut}t∈R iﬀit satisﬁes the β-KMS condition
χ(AUt(B)) = χ(Ut−iβℏ(B)A)
for all
A, B ∈A, t ∈R.
One of the main problems in thermodynamics is the characterization of thermody-
namic equilibrium states. The C∗-algebra approach to thermodynamics is able to
do this. The three letters KMS stand for the names of the physicists Kubo, Martin,
and Schwinger. For the historical background, see the discussion on page 659.
The following is crucial for distinguishing between classical physics and quantum
physics.
The passage from classical physics to quantum physics corresponds to the
passage from commutative algebras to noncommutative algebras.
For example, this also corresponds to the passage from classical information to
quantum information, which represents the theoretical framework for the intended
construction of quantum computers in the future. This will be studied in Vol. IV.
We refer to N. Nielsen and M. Chuang, Quantum Computation and Quantum
Information, Cambridge University Press, 2001.
Orthogonal projections as fundamental observables related to ques-
tions posed by physical experiments. The simplest observables in L(X, X) are
orthogonal projection operators. Let us summarize elementary properties.147 We
set
A := L(X, X).
We assume that X is a complex separable non-trivial Hilbert space. We will use
such a language that later on we can replace L(X, X) by a von Neumann algebra
A which is a factor (see page 657). In the language of von Neumann algebras, the
following properties of orthogonal projections will tell us that L(X, X) is a von
Neumann algebra (more precisely, a factor) of type I.
(i) Orthogonal projections: By deﬁnition, an orthogonal projection is an element
of A with P ∗= P and P 2 = P. Let P(A) denote the set of all orthogonal
projections in A.
Geometrically, this means the following. For any ψ ∈X, we have the decom-
position
ψ = Pψ + (I −P)ψ
where Pψ is contained in the closed linear subspace P(X) of X, and (I −P)ψ
is contained in the orthogonal complement P(X)⊥.148 By the Pythagorean
theorem,
||ψ||2 = ||Pψ||2 + ||(I −P)ψ||2.
Hence if P ̸= 0, then ||P|| = 1. Conversely, let Y be a linear closed subspace
Y of X. For given ψ ∈X, the variational problem
||ψ −ϕ|| = min!,
ϕ ∈Y
has a unique solution denoted by Pψ. Then P : X →Y is an orthogonal
projection onto the subspace Y .
147 For the missing proofs, we refer to Zeidler (1995a) (see the references on page
1049), and to F. Riesz and B. Nagy, Functional Analysis, Frederyck Ungar, New
York, 1978.
148 Recall that, for a subset L of the Hilbert space X, the orthogonal complement
is given by L⊥:= {ψ ∈X : ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= 0 for all ϕ ∈L}.

636
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
(ii) Partial ordering on P(A): Let Q, P ∈P(A). We write
Q ≤P
iﬀ
PQ = Q.
This is a partial ordering on P(A). Geometrically, this is equivalent to the
inclusion Q(X) ⊆P(X).
(iii) Expectation values: Let P, Q ∈P(A). Then,
• 0 ≤⟨ψ|Pψ⟩≤||ψ||2 for all ψ ∈X,149 and
• Q ≤P iﬀ⟨ψ|Qψ⟩≤⟨ψ|Pψ⟩for all ψ ∈X.
In terms of expectation values in physics, this means
0 ≤¯P ≤1
and
Q ≤P ⇒¯Q ≤¯P.
Here, we exclude the trivial case X = {0}.
(iv) Eigenvalues: Let P ∈P(A) with P ̸= 0. If
Pψ = λψ
with ||ψ|| = 1, then either λ = 1 or λ = 0. The eigenspace to the eigenvalue
λ = 1 (resp. λ = 0) is P(X) (resp. the orthogonal complement P(X)⊥). In
terms of mathematical logic, we regard the observable P as a question and the
eigenvalues λ = 1 (resp. λ = 0) correspond to the answers “yes” (resp. “no”).
(v) Orthogonality: Let P, Q ∈P(A). We say that P is orthogonal to Q iﬀPQ = 0.
Geometrically, this means that P(X) is orthogonal to Q(X).
(vi) Partial isometry: The linear continuous operator U : X →X is called a partial
isometry iﬀwe have
||Uψ|| = ||ψ||
for all
ψ ∈ker(U)⊥.
That is, if we use the orthogonal composition, X = Y ⊕Y ⊥with respect
to the subspace Y := ker(U), then U = 0 on Y , and U : Y ⊥→im(U)
is an isometry. More precisely, it follows from the Fredholm alternative that
im(U) = ker(U ∗)⊥, and hence the operator
U : ker(U)⊥→ker(U ∗)⊥
is a unitary operator.
(vii) The Murray–von Neumann equivalence relation: Let Q, P ∈P(A). We write
Q ∼P
iﬀthere exists an operator U ∈A with Q = UU ∗and P = U ∗U. This is a
equivalence relation.
Geometrically, this means that U is a partial isometry whose restriction
U : P(X) →Q(X)
to the space P(X) is a unitary operator onto the space Q(X). Similarly, U ∗is a
partial isometry whose restriction U ∗: Q(X) →P(X) is a unitary operator.150
If Q, P ∈P(A), then
||Q −P|| < 1
implies
Q ∼P.
149 Note that ⟨ψ|Pψ⟩= ⟨ψ|P 2ψ⟩= ⟨Pψ|Pψ⟩= ||Pψ||2 ≤||ψ||2.
150 To prove this, note that ||Pψ||2 = ⟨ψ|Pψ⟩= ⟨Uψ|Uψ⟩= ||Uψ||2. Thus, we
obtain ker(U) = P(X)⊥. Similarly, ker(U ∗) = Q(X)⊥.

(viii) The trivial center: The algebra A has a trivial center. This means that if
B ∈A and AB = BA for all A ∈A, then B is a multiple of the unit operator
(i.e., B = λI for some complex number λ). This is called the Schur lemma. 151
(ix) Invariant linear subspaces of X. The linear subspace Y of X is called invariant
under A iﬀA(Y ) ⊆Y for all A ∈A.
(x) The dimension function: Let P, Q ∈P(A). Deﬁne d(P) := dim P(X). Then:
• d(P) = d(Q) iﬀP ∼Q.
• If P(X) is orthogonal to Q(X), then d(P + Q) = d(P) + d(Q).
In what follows, we will show that orthogonal projections play a crucial role con-
cerning
• the Gleason theorem and
• the Murray–von Neumann classiﬁcation of factors of von Neumann algebras (see
page 657).
7.17.2 Gleason’s Extension Theorem – the Main Theorem of
Quantum Logic
Among other features, the Gleason theorem means that:
• Probabilities provide a tool for constructing the language of physics long
before they can be considered as empirically meaningful quantities.
• The expression for the probabilities ﬁrst proposed by Max Born (in
1926) is an unavoidable part of an interpretation. If any probability
should ever play a part in the theory, it can be only this one.
• The density operator (introduced by von Neumann) is the basic notion
one must associate with a quantum state and not simply a pure state
represented by a wave function.152
Roland Omn`es, 1994
Let X be a complex separable Hilbert space. Let P denote the set of all orthogonal
projections P : X →X. By deﬁnition, a pre-state of the C∗-algebra L(X, X) is a
function s : P →[0, 1] with the property that we have
s(P1 + . . . + Pn) = s(P1) + . . . + s(Pn)
for each ﬁnite family of orthogonal projections P1, . . . , Pn ∈P with the additional
property that Pi(X) is orthogonal to Pj(X) if i ̸= j. Such a pre-state is also called
a ﬁnitely additive measure on P.
Theorem 7.63 If the dimension of the Hilbert space X is 3 or larger, then each
pre-state can be uniquely extended to a state of the C∗-algebra L(X, X).
Conversely, the restriction of any state on L(X, X) to the space of orthogonal
projections P is a pre-state.
From the philosophical point of view, roughly speaking, Gleason’s theorem tells us

The mean value. Let us consider a physical system S which can be in the ﬁnite
number of states
S1, ..., SM
with the probabilities p1, . . . , pM, respectively. Suppose that the physical quantity
A (e.g., energy) attains the value Am in the state Sm. By deﬁnition, if we measure
the physical quantity A of the system S, then we get the mean value
χ(A) :=
M
X
m=1
pmAm.
(7.287)
We also write ¯A instead of χ(A).
Fluctuations and correlations can be described by mean values.
In fact, the ﬂuctuation ΔA ≥0 of the physical quantity A is deﬁned by
(ΔA)2 = (A −¯A)2 =
M

pm(A −¯A)2.
Obviously, (ΔA)2 = A2−( ¯A)2. For two physical quantities A and B, the correlation

the mean value of A with respect to the pure state Sm0.

A : S →C
is denoted by A. We write Am := A(Sm), and A∗(Sm) := A(Sm)†. If A, B ∈A and
α, β ∈C, then
αA + βB,
AB,
A∗
are also contained in A. In addition, we introduce the norm
||A|| :=
sup
m=1,...,M
|A(Sm)|.
The set A is a commutative unital C∗-algebra which is called the extended algebra
of observables.
• Observables: The real-valued functions in A (i.e., A∗= A) are called observables.
• States: Let 0 ≤p1, . . . , pM ≤1 and p1 + . . . + pM = 1. Deﬁne the function
χ : A →C
by the key relation (7.287) above. Precisely all such functions are called states
of the C∗-algebra A. These functions have the following positivity property
χ(AA∗) = PM
m=1 pmAmA†
m ≥0.
• Mean value: The value χ(A) is called the mean value of the observable A in the
state χ.
The grand canonical ensemble. Now let us consider special physical systems
whose states are characterized by energy and particle number. This is typical for
statistical physics. More precisely, assume that the physical system S can be in the
ﬁnite number of states S1, . . . , SM; each state Sm is characterized by the energy
Em and the particle number Nm. We will motivate below that it is reasonable to
assume that the number
pm =
e(μNm−Em)/kT
PM
m=1 e(μNm−Em)/kT ,
m = 1, . . . , M
(7.288)
is the probability for ﬁnding the physical system in the state Sm. Here, the param-
eter T > 0 is called the (absolute) temperature, the real parameter μ is called the
chemical potential, and k is the Boltzmann constant. The mean energy ¯E and the
energy ﬂuctuation ΔE ≥0 are given by
¯E =

Physical interpretation. The grand canonical ensemble describes a (large)
many-particle system which is able to exchange energy and particles with its envi-
ronment. However, we assume that this exchange is so weak that one can attribute a
mean energy and a mean particle number to the system S. Moreover, this exchange
is governed by two macroscopic parameters, namely, the absolute temperature T
and the chemical potential μ. This tells us that the many-particle system does not
behave wildly, but regularly. Physicists say that the system is in thermodynamic

equilibrium. For example, the sun radiates photons into the universe at the ﬁxed
surface temperature of about 6000 K. The change of the particle number can be
caused by chemical reactions. This motivates the designation ‘chemical potential’
for μ.
The special case where μ = 0 corresponds to a ﬁxed particle number (i.e., there
are no chemical reactions or no particle exchange with the environment). The grand
canonical ensemble with μ = 0 is called canonical ensemble.
The importance of the partition function. The main trick of statistical
physics is to introduce the function
Z(T, μ) :=
M
X
m=1
e(μNm−Em)/kT
(7.289)
which is called the partition function of the grand canonical ensemble. The following
proposition tells us that
The knowledge of the partition function allows us to compute all of the
crucial thermodynamic quantities in statistical physics.
To this end, we introduce the so-called statistical potential
Ω(T, μ) := −kT ln Z(T, μ).
(7.290)
This function is also called the Gibbs potential. An elementary computation shows
that the following relations hold for the partial derivatives of the statistical poten-
tial.
(i) Entropy: S = −ΩT .
(ii) Mean particle number: ¯
N = −Ωμ.
(iii) Particle number ﬂuctuation: (ΔN)2 = kT ¯
Nμ.
(iv) Free energy: By deﬁnition, F := Ω + μ ¯
N.
(v) Mean energy: ¯E = F + TS.155
(vi) Energy ﬂuctuation: If the particle number is ﬁxed (i.e., μ = 0), then we obtain
(ΔE)2 = kT 2 ¯ET .
(vii) Pressure: Suppose that the energies E1, . . . , EM and the particle numbers
N1, . . . , NM depend on the volume V of the physical system. Then the statis-
tical potential Ω(T, μ, V ) also depends on the volume V , and the pressure of
the physical system is deﬁned by P := −ΩV .
The reader should observe that the Feynman functional integral
Z =
Z
eiS[ψ]/ℏDψ
can be regarded as a (formal) continuous variant of the partition function.
7.17.4 Information, Entropy, and the Measure of Disorder
Many-particle systems in nature are able to store information. This is
equivalent to both the measure of disorder and the notion of entropy in
physics.

155 The mean energy is also called the inner energy.

Information and words. In order to get some information in daily life, it is useful
to ask L questions which have to be answered by ‘yes’ or ‘no’. Then the typical
answer looks like
Y N . . . NN.
(7.291)
This is a word of length L with the two letters Y (yes) and N (no). Intuitively,
the minimal number L of questions measures information. For example, suppose
we have n balls of diﬀerent weight. We want to know the heaviest ball. Using a
balance, if n = 2, then we need one experiment (question). If n = 3, then we need
two experiments. Generally, it follows by induction that we need n −1 experiments
for n balls in order to ﬁnd out the heaviest ball. After knowing this, we gain the
information I = n −1.
Observe that in computers, we use words of the type (7.291) in order to trans-
port information. It is our goal to generalize this simple approach to more general
situations. Interestingly enough, it turns out that one has to use the methods of
probability theory.
General deﬁnition of information. Let M = 1, 2, . . . . Consider a random
experiment which has the possible M outcomes
O1, O2, . . . , OM
(7.292)
where Om appears with the probability pm. Here, 0 ≤p1, p2, . . . , pM ≤1 and
p1 + p2 + . . . + pM = 1. The nonnegative number
I := −
M
X
m=1
pm log2 pm
(7.293)
is called the information of the random experiment (7.292).156 The unit of I is
called bit. Moreover, 1 byte = 8 bits. Intuitively, we gain the information I after
performing the random experiment and after knowing the outcome. For example,
let us throw a coin L times. The outcome corresponds to a word of the form (7.291),
where Y and N stand for head and tail, respectively. The number of words of type
(7.291) is equal to 2L. Thus, the probability for a single outcome of the random
coin experiment is equal to
pm = 1
2L ,
m = 1, . . . , 2L.
After performing the coin experiment, we gain the information
I = −
2L
X
m=1
pm log2 pm = log2 2L = L.
This coincides with the intuitive information introduced above in terms of answering
yes/no questions. The number 2L is called the statistical weight of the event (7.291).
Suppose that we have p1 = 1 and p2 = . . . = pM = 0. Then we know the
outcome O1 of our random experiment in advance. This means that we do not
156 By convention, if pm := 0 for some index m, then we set pm log2 pm = 0.

−log2 1 = 0.
The genetic code. The DNA (desoxyribonucleic acid) encodes the genetic
information. This is a double-stranded molecule held together by weak bounds
between base pairs of nucleotides. The four nucleotides in DNA contain the bases:
adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). A single strand can be
formally described by a word
AGCT . . . G
(7.294)
of length L with the four letters A, C, G, T. There are 4L such words. Introducing
the weight pm := 1/4L, the word (7.294) contains the information
I = −
4L
X
m=1
pm log2 pm = log2 4L = 2L.
In nature, base pairs are only formed between A and T and between C and G.
Thus, the base sequence (7.294) of each single strand can be deduced from that
of its partner. The crucial protein synthesis in a biological cell is encoded into the
messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid). This can be formally described by a word
Cm1Cm2 . . . CmL
(7.295)
of length L with the twenty letters C1, C2, . . . , C20. These letters are called codons.
Each codon is a word of length 3 with the letters A, C, G, T. Consequently, there
are 43 = 64 codons. However, by redundance, only 20 codons are essential. This
corresponds to the multiplicity of spectral lines in the spectroscopy of molecules.
This analogy combined with supersymmetry can be used in order to model math-
ematically the redundance of codons.157 The information encoded into the word
(7.295) is equal to I = log2 20L = L log2 20.
The properties of the information function. Let
σM := {(p1, . . . , pM) :
0 ≤p1 + . . . + pM ≤1, p1 + . . . + pM = 1}
be an (M −1)-dimensional simplex in RM. This is the closed convex hull of the M
extremal points (vertices) (1, 0, . . . , 0), . . . , (0, . . . , 0, 1). The proof of the following
statement will be given in Problem 7.37.
Proposition 7.64 The function I : σM →R given by (7.293) is continuous and
concave.158 The minimal value I = 0 is attained at the extremal points of σM.
Furthermore, the maximal value I = log2 M is attained at the point pk =
1
M for all
k = 1, . . . , M.
Measure of disorder. Consider the following experiment. We are given N
particles, and we want to distribute them into M boxes B1, . . . , BM. Each possible
distribution can be described by the symbol

is called the measure of disorder of the distribution (7.296). In order to show that
this deﬁnition is reasonable, consider the following special cases.
• By Prop. 7.64, 0 ≤I ≤log2 M.
• If all of the particles are in the same box, say, B1, then we have p1 = 1 and
p2 = . . . = pM = 0 Hence I = −p1 log2 p1 = 0. This corresponds to minimal
disorder.
• If each box contains the same number of particles, then Nm = N
M . Hence pm =
1
M
for m = 1, . . . , M. Therefore, I = log2 M. This corresponds to maximal disorder.
Entropy. For historical reasons, physicists replace the information I from
(7.293) by the quantity
S = −k
M
X
m=1
pm ln pm.
Here, we use the Boltzmann constant k = 1.380 · 10−23 J/K. This implies that
the entropy S has the physical dimension (heat) energy per temperature (see Sect.
7.17.11 on page 654). Since ln pm = ln 2 · log2 pm, the relation between entropy and
information is given by
S = I · k ln 2.
Intuitively, the entropy S measures the disorder of a many-particle system in
physics. We have 0 ≤S ≤k ln M. Recent astronomical observations show that
our universe is expanding in an accelerated manner. This means that stars and
black holes decay after a long time.159 Hence the disorder of the universe increases,
that is, the entropy increases. This was postulated by Clausius (1822–1888) in 1865.
He called this the heat death of the universe.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Theorem 7.65 Consider (p1, . . . , pM) given by (7.288) on page 639. Suppose that
the real parameter μ and the positive parameter T are ﬁxed in such a way that the
constraints (7.298) are satisﬁed. In addition, assume that 0 < p1, . . . , pM < 1 and

has rank three. Then (p1, . . . , pM) is the unique solution of the maximum problem
(7.297), (7.298).
Proof. (I) Local existence. We will use the suﬃcient solvability condition for the
Lagrangian multiplier rule (see Prop. 43.23 of Zeidler (1986), Vol. III (see the ref-
erences on page 1049). To this end, set

That is, we add the constraints (7.298) to the function S which has to be maximized.
The real numbers α, β, γ (called Lagrange multipliers) will be chosen below. For the
partial derivatives, we get
Lpm = −k ln pm −k −αEm −βNm −γ,
and
Lpjpm = −kδjm
pm .
By (7.288), we choose μ, T and (p1, . . . , pM) in such a way that the constraints
(7.298) are satisﬁed. Moreover, we set
α := 1
T ,
β := −μ
T ,
γ := −k + k ln
X
m
e(μNm−Em)/kT .
Then Lpm = 0 for all m, and the matrix (−Lpjpm) is positive deﬁnite. This guar-
antees that our choice (p1, . . . , pM) represents a local maximum of the entropy
function S under the constraints (7.298).
(II) Global existence. Since the entropy function S is concave, each local max-
imum of S on a convex set is always a global maximum. (We refer to Prop. 42.3
of Zeidler (1986), Vol. III (see the references on page 1049), and note that −S is
convex.)
(III) Uniqueness. On the boundary of the cube C, the entropy function S van-
ishes. Therefore, any solution of (7.297), (7.298) lies in the interior of C. Since the
matrix (−Spjpm) is positive deﬁnite, the function S is strictly concave on the inte-
rior of C. This implies the uniqueness of the solution (see Theorem 38.C. of Zeidler
(1986), Vol. III).

In the special case where the particle numbers are ﬁxed, we use the choice
N1 = . . . = NM = ¯
N, and μ = 0. Then we have merely to assume that the matrix

has rank two, that is, there exist at least two diﬀerent energies.

7.17.5 Semiclassical Statistical Physics
In semiclassical statistical physics, the extended algebra of observables is a
commutative ∗-algebra of functions, and the states are generated by some
probability measure.
Folklore
The key relation reads as
¯A :=
Z
M
A(q, p)ϱ(q, p)dqdp
h
.
Here, we use the product set M := B × R, where B is a closed interval on the real
line. We are given the bounded continuous function A : M →C and the bounded
continuous function ϱ : M →[0, ∞[ with the normalization condition
Z
M
ϱ(q, p)dqdp
h
= 1.
Then the function ϱ represents a probability density on the phase space M, and ¯A
is the mean value of the function A = A(q, p). Traditionally, this function is called
a (physical) observable iﬀit is real-valued.160 The square of the mean ﬂuctuation
is given by
(ΔA)2 =
Z
M
(A(q, p) −¯A)2ϱ(q, p)dqdp
h
.
In terms of physics, we consider an ideal gas161 on the interval B, that is, the position
coordinate q of a single gas particle lives on the interval B, and the momentum
coordinate p lives on the real line R. If H = H(q, p) is the Hamiltonian function of
a single gas particle, then we choose the function
ϱ(q, p) :=
e−H(q,p)/kT
R
M e−H(q,p)/kT dqdp
h
.
This function generates the semiclassical Gibbs statistics.162 Here, T is the absolute
temperature, k is the Boltzmann constant, and h is Planck’s quantum of action.
For example, if the gas particles behave like harmonic oscillators, then we choose
H(q, p) =
p2
2m + mω2q2
2
. We need the physical constants k and h in order to guarantee
that both the quantities H(q,p)
kT
and dqdp
h
are dimensionless. This implies that the
function e−H(q,p)/kT makes sense, the probability density ϱ is dimensionless, and
the mean value ¯A has the same dimension as the physical observable A(q, p). For
example, if we choose A(q, p) := H(q, p), then N ¯H is the mean energy of the ideal
gas at the temperature T, where N is the number of gas particles. The function
S(q, p) = −kϱ(q, p) ln ϱ(q, p)
160 Note that the algebra of observables to be introduced below is not only based on
real-valued functions, but on complex-valued functions in order to get a complex
∗-algebra.
161 An ideal gas is characterized by the property that there are no interactions
between the gas particles, that is, the single gas particles behave like independent
random objects.

is the probability for ﬁnding the position-momentum coordinate (q, p) of a single
gas particle in the set C. Let us translate this into the language of ∗-algebras.
The extended ∗-algebra A of observables. Let A denote the set of all
bounded continuous functions A : M →C. With respect to the star operation
A∗(q, p) := A(q, p)† for all (q, p) ∈M, the set A is a commutative ∗-algebra with
unit element 1.163 The ∗-algebra A is called the extended ∗-algebra of observables
(of the gas). Precisely the real-valued functions A in A are called observables. In
addition, equipped with the norm

the ∗-algebra A becomes a normed space with
• ||A∗|| = ||A|| and ||A∗A|| = ||A||2 for all A ∈A;
• ||1|| = 1.
Since the phase space M is an unbounded closed subset of R2 (i.e., M is not
compact), the normed space A is not a Banach space. We call A an incomplete
C∗-algebra (or a pre-C∗-algebra).
States. Generally, states are functionals χ which assign a real number χ(A) to
each observable A. We deﬁne
χ(A) :=
Z
M
A(q, p)ϱ(q, p)dqdp
h
for all
A ∈A.
Then, for all A ∈A, we have:
• χ(A∗A) =
R
M A(q, p)†A(q, p)ϱ(q, p) dqdp
h
≥0;
• χ(I) =
R
M 1 · ϱ(q, p) dqdp
h
= 1.
• The map χ : A →C is linear.
• |χ(A)| ≤sup(q,p)∈R2 |A(q, p)| = ||A||.
We call χ a state on the ∗-algebra A. This state corresponds to the probability
measure ν generated by the probability density ϱ (i.e., dν = ϱ dqdp
h ).
Dynamics. To avoid technicalities, choose J := R, that is, M = R2. Motivated
by the classical equation of motion
˙q(t) = Hp(q(t), p(t)),
˙p(t) = −Hq(q(t), p(t)),
t ∈R
(7.299)
with the initial condition q(0) = q0, p(0) = p0, we deﬁne
(UtA)(q0, p0) := A(q(t), p(t))
for all times t ∈R and all initial points (q0, p0) ∈R2. We assume that, as for the
harmonic oscillator, the trajectories q = q(t), p = p(t) exist for all times. Then, for
each time t ∈R, the map
Ut : A →A
163 Here, 1 is given by the function A(q, p) ≡1.

7.17 A Glance at the Algebraic Approach to Quantum Physics

is a ∗-automorphism. Thus, {Ut}t∈R is a one-parameter group of ∗-automorphisms
of the ∗-algebra A.
Our next goal is to prove that the dynamics of the gas corresponds to a family
{Ut}t∈R of unitary operators Ut on the Hilbert space L2(R2). To this end, let
Apre denote the set of all smooth functions A : R2 →C with compact support.
Obviously, Apre is a ∗-subalgebra of the ∗-algebra A of observables. In addition,
Apre is a dense subset of the Hilbert space L2(R2) equipped with the inner product
⟨A|B⟩:=
R
R2 A(q, p)†B(q, p)dqdp.
Proposition 7.66 Let A, B ∈Apre. Then ⟨UtA|UtB⟩= ⟨A|B⟩for all t ∈R.
This tells us that the dynamics of the gas respects the inner product on the
Hilbert space L2(R2). Using this result and the extension theorem from Problem
7.21, we get the following.
Corollary 7.67 For any time t ∈R, the operator Ut : Apre →A can be uniquely
extended to a unitary operator Ut : L2(R) →L2(R).
It remains to prove Prop. 7.66. Using the equation (7.299) of motion, we get
d
dt(UtA)(q0, p0) = Aq(q(t), p(t))Hp(q(t), p(t)) −Ap(q(t), p(t))Hq(q(t), p(t)).
Noting that Hqp = Hpq, integration by parts yields
Z
R2(A†

This implies

Generalization. The simple special case considered above can be generalized
to 2s-dimensional phase space manifolds M by starting from the key formula
¯A :=
Z
M
A(q, p)dν(q, p)
with
R
M dν = 1. Here, (q, p) = (q1, . . . , qs; p1, . . . , ps). As a rule, the Hamiltonian
H = H(q, p) describes interactions between the particles; this corresponds to so-
called real gases.
For example, consider a gas consisting of N molecules in a box B of ﬁnite volume
V in the 3-dimensional space. Then s = 3N, and M = BN × R3N. Moreover,
dν := ϱ(q, p)dq3Ndp3N
h3NN!
with
ϱ(q, p) :=
e−H(q,p)/kT
R
M e−H(q,p)/kT dq3N dp3N
h3N N!
.
We assume that the function ϱ is invariant under permutations of the particles. The
factorial N! takes the Pauli principle into account (principle of indistinguishable
particles). If we introduce the partition function
Z(T, V ) :=
Z
M
e−H(q,p)/kT dq3Ndp3N
h3NN!
,
then we obtain the following thermodynamic quantities:
• Free energy: F(T, V ) := −kT ln Z(T, V ).
• Entropy: S(T, V ) = −FT (T, V ).
• Pressure: P(T, V ) = −FV (T, V ).
• Mean energy: ¯E(T, V ) = F(T, V ) + TS(T, V ).

7.17.6 The Classical Ideal Gas
Let us consider an ideal gas which consists of N freely moving molecules of mass
m. The ﬁxed particle number N is assumed to be large (of magnitude 1023). We
assume that the molecules move in a 3-dimensional box B of volume V . Then the
following hold:
(i) Free energy: F = −NkT(1 + ln V (2πmkT )3/2

vector v = OP. The probability of ﬁnding the endpoint P of the velocity
vector v of a single molecule in the open subset C of R3 is given by the Gaussian

Here, mv2/2 is the kinetic energy of the freely moving molecule, and the nor-
malization factor guarantees that the probability is equal to one if C = R3.
The experience of physicists shows that these formulas are valid if the temperature
T is suﬃciently high.164 Let us compute (i) through (vi). We start with the energy

7.17.7 Bose–Einstein Statistics
Let us consider the following situation which frequently arises in quantum statis-
tics. Suppose that the system Γ (e.g., a gas of photons) consists of particles that
may assume one of the energy values ε0, . . . , εM. By deﬁnition, a state of Γ is
characterized by
ε0, ε1, . . . , εJ;
n0, n1, . . . , nJ.
(7.301)
This means that precisely nj particles of Γ have the energy εj, where the index j
runs from 0 to J. For each such state, the particle number N and the energy E are
given by
N =
J
X
j=0
nj,
E =
J
X
j=0
njεj.
Therefore, the partition function is given by
Z(T, μ) :=
X
Γ
e(μN−E)/kT =
J
Y
j=0
X
nj
e(μnj−njεj)/kT .
Furthermore, we introduce the statistical potential
Ω(T, μ) := −kT ln Z(T, μ) = −kT
J
X
j=0
ln
X
nj
“
e(μ−εj)/kT ”nj .
(7.302)
We now make the crucial assumption that
Each occupation number nj may assume the values 0, 1, . . . , n.
This corresponds to bosons (that is, particles with integer spin, e.g., photons). Using
the geometric series, Ω(T, μ) is equal to
−kT

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Furthermore, assume that the maximal occupation number n is very large and
μ −εj < 0 for all j. Letting n →∞, we get the ﬁnal statistical potential
Ω(T, μ) = kT
J
X
j=0
ln
“
1 −e(μ−εj)/kT ”
.
By (7.290) on page 640, N = −Ωμ, S = −ΩT , F = Ω + μN, and E = F + TS. This
yields the following.
(i) Mean particle number: N = PJ
j=0 Nj where Nj :=
e(μ−εj )/kT
1−e(μ−εj )/kT .
(ii) Mean energy: E = PJ
j=0 Njεj.
(iii) Free energy: F = Ω + μN.
(iv) Entropy: S = E−F
T
.
In particular, if each particle behaves like a quantum harmonic oscillator of angular
frequency ω, then εj = ℏω(j + 1
2). We have shown in Sect. 2.3.2 of Vol. I that
Planck’s radiation law is a consequence of the mean energy formula (ii) for the
quantum harmonic oscillator.
The Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics as a limit case for high tempera-
ture. In the special case where e(μ−εj)/kT ≪1 (e.g., μ −εj < 0 and T is large), we
approximately obtain
Nj = e(μ−εj)/kT .
(7.303)
This is called the classical Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics. which generalizes the
Maxwell velocity distribution (7.300) on page 648.
Bose–Einstein condensation as a limit case at low temperature. Sup-
pose that 0 ≤ε0 < ε1 < ε2 < . . . . We expect that at low temperatures most of the
bosons are located in the ground state. In fact, by (i), for the particle numbers we
get
lim
T →+0
lim
μ→ε0−0 Nj(T, μ) =
(
+∞
if
j = 0,
0
if
j = 1, 2, . . .
This phenomenon is called Bose–Einstein condensation.
7.17.8 Fermi–Dirac Statistics
In contrast to the preceding section, we now assume that
Each occupation number nj may only assume the values 0, 1.
This corresponds to the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions (that is, particles
with half-integer spin, e.g., electrons).166 This yields
Ω(T, μ) = −kT
J
X
j=0
ln(1 + e(μ−εj)/kT ).
As in Sect. 7.17.7, we now obtain the following:s
166 More precisely, if s is the spin of the particles, then each energy value εj has to
be counted with the multiplicity 2s + 1.

7.17 A Glance at the Algebraic Approach to Quantum Physics

(i) Mean particle number: N = PJ
j=0 Nj where Nj :=
e(μ−εj )/kT
1+e(μ−εj )/kT .
(ii) Mean energy: E = PJ
j=0 Njεj.
(iii) Free energy: F = Ω + μN.
(iv) Entropy: S = E−F
T
.
If e(μ−εj)/kT ≪1 (e.g., μ −εj < 0 and T is large), then we obtain the classical
Maxwell–Boltzmann statistics (7.303).
The Fermi ball as a limit case at low temperature. For the particle
numbers, we get
lim
T →+0 Nj(T, μ) =
(
1
if
εj < μ,
0
if
μ < εj.
This means that at low temperature each of the lowest energy levels is occupied
by precisely one particle. In contrast to Bose–Einstein condensation, by the Pauli
principle it is impossible that all of the particles are in the ground state. For ex-
ample, consider a gas of N electrons in a box of volume V in the limit case of
temperature T = 0. Since the electron has spin s = 1
2, each cell of volume h3 in
the phase space contains two electrons with diﬀerent spin orientations. Thus, if P
denotes the maximal momentum of the electrons at T = 0, then the phase space
volume 4
3πP 3 · V contains N particles where
N = 2
h3 · 4
3πP 3V.
The ball of radius P is called the Fermi ball of the N-particle electron gas at zero
temperature, and the surface of the Fermi ball is called the Fermi surface.
Applications of the Bose–Einstein statistics and the Fermi–Dirac statistics to
interesting physical phenomena can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV, Chap. 68
(see the references on page 1049). For example, this concerns Planck’s radiation
law for photon gases, as well as the Fermi ball which is crucial for computing
the critical Chandrasekhar mass of special stars called white dwarfs (see also N.
Straumann, General Relativity with Applications to Astrophysics, Springer, New
York, 2004). Using the methods of quantum ﬁeld theory, the structure of Fermi
surfaces for electrons in a crystal is studied in M. Salmhofer, Renormalization: An
Introduction, Springer, Berlin, 1999.
7.17.9 Thermodynamic Equilibrium and KMS-States
The grand canonical example in ﬁnite quantum statistics. Let X be a
ﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert space, X ̸= {0}. Choose the density operator
ϱ0 :=
eβ(μN−H)
tr eβ(μN−H) .
Here, H, N : X →X are self-adjoint operators, and β > 0 and μ are real parame-
ters, with the temperature T, the Boltzmann constant k, the chemical potential μ,
and β = 1/kT. In the language of C∗-algebras, the following hold.
• The extended C∗-algebra A = L(X, X) of observables consists of all linear oper-
ators A : X →X equipped with the norm ||A|| :=
p
tr(A∗A).
• The states are deﬁned by χ0(A) := tr(ϱ0A) for all A ∈A.

652
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• The dynamics of the state χ0 is given by
χt(A) := tr(ϱ0UtA)
for all A ∈A and all times t ∈R. Here, Ut(A) := eitH/ℏAe−itH/ℏ.
Proposition 7.68 The state χ0 corresponding to the density operator ϱ0 and the
dynamics {χt}t∈R is a KMS-state of temperature T.
Proof. Set Z := tr(eβ(μN−H)). To simplify notation, choose μ := 0 and ℏ:= 1.
Then
χ0(A) = tr(ϱ0A) = Z−1 tr(e−βHA).
Noting the commutativity property of the trace, tr(CD) = tr(DC), we get
Zχ0(Ut−iβ(B)A) = tr(e−βHei(t−iβ)HBe−i(t−iβ)HA) = tr(eitHBe−itHe−βHA)
= tr(e−βHAeitHBe−itH) = Zχ0(AUt(B)).

Example. As a typical example, choose the operators H and N in such a way
that
Hψj = Ejψj,
Nψj = Njψj,
j = 1, . . . , n
where ψ1, . . . , ψn is an orthonormal basis of X, and Ej, Nj are nonnegative numbers
for all j. Then ϱ0ψj = pjψj with
pj =
eβ(μNj−Ej)
Pn
j=1 eβ(μNj−Ej) .
The operator H (resp. N) is called the Hamiltonian with the energy levels
E1, . . . , En (resp. the particle operator with the particle numbers N1, . . . , Nn.)
7.17.10 Quasi-Stationary Thermodynamic Processes and
Irreversibility
In the huge factory of natural processes, the principle of entropy occu-
pies the position of manager, for it dictates the manner and method of
the whole business, whilst the principle of energy merely does the book-
keeping, balancing debits and credits. . .
Life on the earth needs the radiation of the sun. Our conditions of existence
require a determinate degree of temperature, and for the maintenance of
this there is needed not addition of energy, but addition of entropy.167
Robert Emden, 1938
Let us study the suﬃciently regular time-evolution of the grand canonical ensem-
ble. By a quasi-stationary process of the grand canonical ensemble, we understand
smooth time-depending functions of temperature, chemical potential, and volume:
T = T(t),
μ = μ(T),
V = V (t),
t0 ≤t ≤t1.
(7.304)
By (7.290) on page 640, this yields the following quantities:
E = E(t),
N = N(t),
S = S(t),
P = P(t),
t0 ≤t ≤t1.

7.17 A Glance at the Algebraic Approach to Quantum Physics
653
Here, E is the mean energy, N is the mean particle number, S is the entropy, and
P is the pressure.168 From the physical point of view, this is an idealization. We
assume that the physical system is in thermodynamic equilibrium at each time t. In
reality, a certain relaxation time is needed in order to pass from a thermodynamic
equilibrium state to a new one. Let Q(t) be the heat added to the physical system
during the time interval [t0, t]. We postulate that, for all times t in the interval
[t0, t1], the process (7.304) has the following properties.
(i) The ﬁrst law of thermodynamics: ˙E(t) = ˙Q(t) −P(t) ˙V (t) + μ(t) ˙N(t).
(ii) The second law of thermodynamics: T(t) ˙S(t) ≥˙Q(t).
(iii) The third law of thermodynamics. Suppose that the temperature T(t) goes
to zero as t →t1 −0. Then so do the entropy S(t) and its partial derivatives
ST (t), Sμ(t), SV (t).
The ﬁrst law describes conservation of energy. To discuss the second law, let us
introduce the external entropy
Se(t) := S(t0) +
Z t
t0
˙Q(τ)
T(τ) dτ,
t0 ≤t ≤t1,
which depends on the heat added to the system. In addition, we introduce the
remaining internal entropy Si(t) := S(t) −Se(t). Then
˙Se(t) =
˙Q(t)
T(t) ,
˙Si(t) ≥0,
t0 ≤t ≤t1.
Assume that t0 = −t1 where t1 > 0. If the quasi-stationary process (7.304) has the
property that also the time-reﬂected process
T = T(−t),
μ = μ(−T),
V = V (−t),
t0 ≤t ≤t1
is quasi-stationary, then the process is called reversible. In this case, because of
d
dtS(−t) = −( d
dtS)(−t), the second law tells us that
−T(−t) ˙S(−t) ≥˙Q(−t),
−t1 ≤t ≤t1.
This implies
T(t) ˙S(t) ≥˙Q(t),
−T(t) ˙S(t) ≥˙Q(t),
−t1 ≤t ≤t1.
Hence T(t) ˙S(t) = ˙Q(t) for all t ∈[−t1, t1]. This means that the internal entropy
Si vanishes on the time interval [−t1, t1]. Processes are called irreversible iﬀthey
are not reversible. Typically, the time-evolution of living beings is irreversible. A
more detailed discussion can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol. IV, Chap. 67 (see the
references on page 1049).
The thermodynamic limit and phase transitions. If the volume V of
the physical system goes to inﬁnity, V →∞, then this limit is called the thermo-
dynamic limit by physicists. Then it may happen that important thermodynamic
quantities become singular for appropriate parameters (e.g., temperature T). These
singularities correspond to phase transitions (e.g., the transition from water to ice).
Phase transitions play a fundamental role for understanding critical phenomena in
nature (e.g., the inﬂation of the very early universe and the emergence of the three
fundamental forces during the cooling process of the hot universe after the Big
168 To simplify notation, we write E and N instead of ¯E and ¯
N, respectively.

Bang).169 In terms of statistical physics, phase transitions correspond to a strong
increase of ﬂuctuations. We will encounter this in later volumes. As an introduc-
tion to the rigorous theory of phase transitions, we recommend the classical survey
article by Griﬃth.170
7.17.11 The Photon Mill on Earth
Living objects store a lot of information related to the genetic code. There arises the
following question in physics: where does this information come from? The solution
of this interesting problem is given by the entropy relation
ΔSe = ΔQ
Tin −ΔQ
Tout ,
which is called the photon mill on earth. In fact, the sun sends photons to the earth
at the temperature Tin = 5800 K, which is the high surface temperature of the sun.
Most of these photons are reﬂected by the surface of earth, and they are sent to
the universe at the lower temperature Tout = 260 K. Since Tin > Tout, the earth
radiates the amount of entropy ΔSe into the universe. More precisely, during one
second, the surface of earth gets the heat energy ΔQ = 1017 J from the sun. Hence
the entropy loss of earth during one second is equal to
ΔSe = −4 · 1014 J/K.
This means that one square meter of the surface of earth radiates the entropy of
about 1 J/K during one second into the universe. The radiated entropy decreases
the disorder on earth, that is, the earth gains order. This is mainly the informa-
tion stored in living objects. Physicists describe this by saying that energy at a
higher temperature has a higher quality than the same amount of energy at a lower
temperature.
7.18 Von Neumann Algebras
In order to deeply understand the mathematical structure of quantum
mechanics, John von Neumann studied a special class of operator algebras.
Nowadays these algebras are called von Neumann algebras.171
Each von Neumann algebra is a C∗-algebra. But the converse is seldom
true.

The theory of von Neumann algebras has been growing in leaps and bounds
in the last 20 years. It has always had strong connections with ergodic the-
ory and mathematical physics. It is now beginning to make contact with
other areas such as diﬀerential geometry and K-theory. . . The book com-
mences with the Murray–von Neumann classiﬁcation of factors, proceeds
through the basic modular theory (the Tomita–Takesaki theory) to the
Connes classiﬁcation of von Neumann algebras of type IIIλ, and con-
cludes with a discussion of crossed-products, Krieger’s ratio set, examples
of factors, and Takesaki’s duality theorem.172

In what follows, X is a complex separable non-trivial Hilbert space (i.e., X ̸= {0}).
7.18.1 Von Neumann’s Bicommutant Theorem
Commutant. Commutation relations play a crucial role in quantum mechanics. In
particular, if two observables commute, then it is possible that they have common
eigenvectors, that is, they can be sharply measured at the same time. This motivated
John von Neumann to investigate commutants of algebras. Consider the C∗-algebra
L(X, X) of the linear continuous operators
A : X →X.
Let S be a subset of L(X, X). By deﬁnition, the operator A ∈L(X, X) belongs to
the commutant S′ of the set S iﬀ
AS = SA
for all
S ∈S.
Naturally enough, we set S′′ := (S′)′ and call this the bicommutant of the set S.
Obviously, S ⊆S′′. Von Neumann studied the special case where S = S′′. A subset
A of L(X, X) is called a ∗-subalgebra iﬀA, B ∈L(X, X) and α, β ∈C imply that
the operators αA + βB, AB, A∗are also contained in L(X, X).
By deﬁnition, a von Neumann algebra is a ∗-subalgebra A of L(X, X) with
unit element and A′′ = A.
This deﬁnition is purely algebraic. Equivalently, one can characterize von Neumann
algebras in topological terms by using weak convergence. Let us discuss this.
Weak operator convergence. Let (An) be a sequence of linear operators
An : X →X in L(X, X), n = 1, 2, . . . We write

the weak operator convergence. This corresponds to the convergence of matrix
elements. In terms of physics, this guarantees the convergence of expectation values.
Generalizing this, let (Aν)ν∈N be a generalized sequence in L(X, X) with a directed
index set N (see page 240). We write
w −lim
ν→∞Aν = A
(7.305)
iﬀA ∈L(X, X) and limν→∞⟨ψ|Aνϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩for all ψ, ϕ ∈X, in the sense of
generalized convergence. In addition, let us introduce the following two notions of
convergence.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• s −limν→∞Aν = A iﬀlimν→∞||(A −Aν)ϕ|| = 0 for all ϕ ∈X (strong operator
convergence);
• u −limν→∞Aν = A iﬀlimν→∞||Aν −A|| = 0 (uniform operator convergence).
Recall that ||Aν −A|| = sup||ϕ||≤1 ||(Aν −A)ϕ||. This justiﬁes the notion of uniform
operator convergence.
Semi-norms. A map p : L →R on the complex (resp. real) linear space L is
called a semi-norm iﬀfor all A, B ∈L and all complex (resp. real) numbers α the
following hold:
• p(A) ≥0,
• p(αA) = |α|p(A), and
• p(A + B) ≤p(A) + p(B).
If, in addition, p(A) = 0 implies A = 0, then p is a norm.
Topologies on L(X, X). (i) Weak operator topology. For ﬁxed ψ, ϕ ∈X, deﬁne
pψ,ϕ(A) := |⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩|
for all
A ∈L(X, X).
This is a semi-norm on L(X, X). A subset S of L(X, X) is called weakly open iﬀ,
for each operator A0 ∈S, there exist a ﬁnite family ψ1, ϕ1, . . . , ψn, ϕn of elements
in X and a number ε > 0 such that the set
{A ∈L(X, X) :
pψj,ϕj(A −A0) < ε, j = 1, . . . , n}
is contained in S. This generates a topology on L(X, X) called the weak operator
topology. A subset of L(X, X) is called weakly closed iﬀits complement in L(X, X)
is weakly open.
A subset S of L(X, X) is weakly closed iﬀ, for all generalized sequences
(Aν) in S, it follows from w −limν→∞Aν = A that A ∈S.
(ii) Strong operator topology. Similarly, we obtain the strong operator topology
by replacing pψ,ϕ by the semi-norm pϕ(A) := ||Aϕ||. A subset S of L(X, X) is called
strongly open iﬀ, for each operator A0 ∈S, there exist a ﬁnite family ϕ1, . . . , ϕn of
elements in X and a number ε > 0 such that the set
{A ∈L(X, X) :
pϕj(A −A0)} < ε, j = 1, . . . , n}
is contained in S. This generates a topology on L(X, X) called the strong operator
topology. A subset of L(X, X) is called strongly closed iﬀits complement in L(X, X)
is strongly open.
A subset S of L(X, X) is strongly closed iﬀ, for all generalized sequences
(Aν) in S, it follows from s −limν→∞Aν = A that A ∈S.
(iii) Uniform operator topology. This topology is obtained by replacing pϕ by
the norm p(A) := ||A||. A subset S of L(X, X) is called uniformly open iﬀ, for each
operator A0 ∈S, there exists a number ε > 0 such that the set
{A ∈L(X, X) :
p(A −A0) < ε}
is contained in S. This generates a topology on L(X, X) called the uniform operator
topology.173 A subset of L(X, X) is called uniformly closed iﬀits complement in
L(X, X) is uniformly open.
173 This topology coincides with the topology induced by the Banach space structure
on L(X, X).

7.18 Von Neumann Algebras
657
A subset S of L(X, X) is uniformly closed iﬀ, for all classical sequences
(An)n∈N in S, it follows from u −limn→∞An = A that A ∈S.
The bicommutant theorem. The topological characterization of von Neu-
mann algebras reads as follows.
Theorem 7.69 Let X be a complex separable non-trivial Hilbert space. For a given
∗-subalgebra A of L(X, X) with unit element, the following three statements are
equivalent:
(i) A is a von Neumann algebra (i.e., A′′ = A).
(ii) A is weakly closed in L(X, X).
(iii) A is strongly closed in L(X, X).
More general, the following hold: If A is a ∗-subalgebra of L(X, X) with unit
element, then the closure of A in the weak (resp. strong) topology on L(X, X)
coincides with the bicommutant A′′.
Corollary 7.70 A ∗-subalgebra algebra of L(X, X) is a C∗-algebra iﬀit is uni-
formly closed in L(X, X).
Consequently, each von Neumann algebra is a C∗-algebra. But the converse is sel-
dom true. For the proofs, we refer to P. Kadison and J. Ringrose, Fundamentals of
the Theory of Operator Algebras, Vol. 1, Academic Press, New York, 1983. Many
beautiful applications of von Neumann algebras to harmonic analysis can be found
in
K. Maurin, Generalized Eigenfunction Expansions and Unitary Represen-
tations of Topological Groups, PWN, Warsaw, 1968.
Examples. Suppose that the operator A ∈L(X, X) is self-adjoint (i.e.,
A∗= A). The bicommutant A′′ of the one-point set A := {A} is the smallest
von Neumann algebra in L(X, X) containing the self-adjoint operator A.
Let S be a subset of L(X, X) with the property that A ∈S implies A∗∈S.
Then:
(i) The commutant S′ is a von Neumann algebra.
(ii) The bicommutant S′′ is the smallest von Neumann algebra in L(X, X) con-
taining the set S.
(iii) S′ = S′′′.
By induction, this implies S′ = S2n+1 and S′′ = S2n+2 for all n = 1, 2, . . . That is,
all of the higher commutants are determined by S′ and S′′.
A von Neumann algebra is called a factor iﬀits center A ∩A′ is trivial (i.e., it
consists of the multiples of the unit operator, A ∩A′ = {αI : α ∈C}).
The classiﬁcation problem for von Neumann algebras. By von Neu-
mann’s spectral theory, a self-adjoint operator A ∈L(X, X) on the Hilbert space
X can be represented by orthogonal projection operators Eλ (λ ∈R) called the
spectral family of A. Now we consider the following generalization:
• self-adjoint operator ⇒von Neumann algebra,
• spectral family ⇒factors.
The building blocks of factors are orthogonal projections.
In contrast to general C∗-algebras, von Neumann algebras possess a rich
structure of orthogonal projections.

658
7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
Since orthogonal projections are observables corresponding to “questions,” von Neu-
mann algebras represent a nice tool for describing physical processes in quantum
theory. Murray and von Neumann showed that each von Neumann algebra can
be represented as a direct sum (or, more general, as a direct integral) of factors.
Therefore it remains to classify the factors.174
7.18.2 The Murray–von Neumann Classiﬁcation of Factors
Let X be a complex separable non-trivial Hilbert space, and let the subset A of
L(X, X) be a von Neumann algebra which is a factor. The factor A is said to be of
type I, II, III iﬀit satisﬁes the following conditions, respectively:
Type I: A contains a minimal projection.
Type II: A contains no minimal projection, but does contain a non-zero projection.
Type III: A contains no non-zero ﬁnite projection.
Here, we use the following terminology. Let P(A) be the set of all orthogonal
projections P ∈A. For P, Q ∈A, we write Q ∼P iﬀthere exists an operator
U ∈A such that Q = UU ∗and P = U ∗U. This is an equivalence relation on P(A).
• The orthogonal projection P is called ﬁnite iﬀit follows from Q(X) ⊆P(X) and
Q ∼P that Q = P.
• The orthogonal projection P is called minimal iﬀthe following three conditions
are satisﬁed:
(α) P ̸= 0.
(β) P(X) is invariant under A′.
(γ) If a linear subspace Y of P(X) is invariant under A′, then Y is trivial (i.e.,
Y = {0} or Y = P(X)).
Minimal projections are always ﬁnite (and non-zero).
For example, if A = L(X, X), then P is ﬁnite iﬀthe projection space P(X) is ﬁnite-
dimensional. Moreover, precisely the orthogonal projections onto one-dimensional
linear subspaces are minimal.
The generalized dimension function of factors. For each factor A, there
exists a function d : P(A) →[0, ∞] which has the following properties:
(i) Q ∼P iﬀd(Q) = d(P).
(ii) If P(X) is orthogonal to Q(X), then d(P + Q) = d(P) + d(Q).
(iii) P is ﬁnite iﬀd(P) < ∞, and d(P) = 0 iﬀP = 0.
The function d is uniquely determined, up to a positive multiplicative constant. For
a suitable choice of this constant, the function d has the following range:
Type In : {0, 1, . . . , n}, where n = 1, 2, . . . or n = ∞.
Type II1: [0, 1].
Type II∞: [0, ∞].
Type III: {0, ∞}.
A factor A is of type In iﬀA = L(X, X) where dim X = n. In this simple case,
d(Q) = dim P(X).
174 Direct integrals of Hilbert spaces generalize direct sums of Hilbert spaces by
summing over general index sets with respect to a measure. This will be con-
sidered in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics (see also K. Maurin, Generalized
Eigenfunction Expansions and Unitary Representations of Topological Groups,
PWN, Warsaw, 1968).

7.18.3 The Tomita–Takesaki Theory and KMS-States
The Tomita–Takesaki theorem is a beautiful example of “prestabilized
harmony” between physics and mathematics.175
On the one hand, it is intimately related to the Kubo–Martin–Schwinger
(KMS) condition. On the other hand it initiated a signiﬁcant advance in
the classiﬁcation theory of von Neumann algebras and led to powerful
computational techniques.
Rudolph Haag, 1996
KMS-states in thermodynamic equilibrium. The physicists Kubo, Martin and
Schwinger discovered in the late 1950s that states of thermodynamic equilibrium
can be characterized by special analyticity properties of the Green’s function.176
In 1967 it was shown by Haag, Hugenholtz, and Winnink that this can be for-
mulated in terms of von Neumann algebras. In fact, it turned out that this was
closely related to the so-called Tomita–Takesaki theory for von Neumann algebras,
which was created by the Japanese mathematician Tomita in the 1960s, by purely
mathematical motivation.177 Roughly speaking, the Tomita–Takesaki theory for-
mulates conditions which guarantee the existence of a dynamics on a von Neumann
algebra that can be used in order to describe the dynamics of a physical state in
thermodynamic equilibrium.
The basic mathematical idea of the Tomita–Takesaki theory. Let A be
a von Neumann algebra of operators on the complex separable non-trivial Hilbert
space X. Suppose that there is a vector ψ0 in X which has the following two
properties:
• ψ0 is cyclic, that is, the set {Aψ0 : A ∈A} is dense in X.
• ψ0 is separating, that is, if A, B ∈A and A ̸= B, then Aψ0 ̸= Bψ0.
Deﬁne the operator S : dom(S) →X by setting178
S(Aψ0) := A∗ψ0
for all
A ∈A.
Then, the operator S has a closure ¯S. By Problem 7.24, there exists the unique
polar decomposition
S = JΔ1/2
with the following properties:
• The so-called modular operator Δ := ¯S∗¯S is self-adjoint and ⟨ψ|Δψ⟩≥0 for all
ψ ∈dom(Δ).
175 The term “prestabilized harmony” was introduced by Leibniz (1646–1716) in his
philosophy of monads (which are ultimate units of being).

178 Since A∗(αϕ) = α†A∗ϕ for all complex numbers α, the operator S is antilinear,
that is, A(αϕ + βψ) = α†A + β†B for all ϕ, ψ ∈X and all α, β ∈C.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
• The so-called modular conjugation operatorJ : X →X is antiunitary, and it has
the property J2 = I.179
For all times t ∈R, we have
ΔitAΔ−it = A,
and JAJ = A.180 Setting Ut(A) := ΔitAΔ−it for all A ∈A, the map
Ut : A →A
is a C∗-automorphism of the von Neumann algebra A, and the family {Ut}t∈R
forms a one-parameter group of C∗-automorphisms on A (see page 634). These
C∗-automorphisms are called modular automorphisms.
For the general mathematical theory of von Neumann algebras together with
numerous applications to quantum physics, see the hints for further reading on page
677. We will come back to this in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics.
7.19 Connes’ Noncommutative Geometry
The abstract theory of commutative Banach algebras was initiated by
Mazur (1905–1981) in 1936, but it blossomed in the hands of Gelfand
(born 1913), who in one brilliant study gave it the ﬁnal perfect shape.
This was the Gelfand theory of maximal ideals, or the Gelfand spectral
theory looking at it the other way. . . The Gelfand spectral theory soon
became a powerful tool and a bonanza of new ideas. Gelfand himself,
Naimark (1909–1978), and others of his co-workers found a multitude of
models and applications.181
Krysztof Maurin, 1968
Noncommutative geometry amounts to a program of uniﬁcation of math-
ematics under the aegis of the quantum apparatus, that is, the theory of
operators and of C∗-algebras. Largely the creation of a single person, Alain
Connes, noncommutative geometry is just coming of age as the new century
opens.182 The bible of the subject is, and will remain, Connes’ Noncommu-
tative Geometry (1994), itself the “3.8 expansion” of the French G´eom´etrie
non commutative from 1990. These are extraordinary books, a “tapestry”
of physics and mathematics, in the words of Vaughan Jones, and the work
of a “poet of modern science,” according to Daniel Kastler, replete with
subtle knowledge and insights apt to inspire several generations.
179 That is, for all ϕ, ψ ∈X and all complex numbers, we have ⟨Jψ|Jϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩†,
and the operator J is antilinear.

of von Neumann algebras of type III, Connes was awarded the Fields medal in
1983. See A. Connes, Une classiﬁcation des facteurs de type III, Ann. Scient.

7.19 Connes’ Noncommutative Geometry
661
Despite an explosion of research by some of the world’s leading mathe-
maticians, and a bouquet of applications – to the reinterpretation of the
phenomenological Standard Model of particle physics as a new space-time
geometry, the quantum Hall eﬀect, strings, renormalization and more in
quantum ﬁeld theory – the six years that have elapsed since the publica-
tion of Noncommutative Geometry have seen no sizeable book returning
to the subject. This volume aspires to ﬁt snugly in that gap, but does not
pretend to ﬁll it. It is rather meant to be an introduction to some of the
core topics of Noncommutative Geometry.183
Jos´e Gracia-Bondia, Joseph V´arilly, and H´ector Figueroa, 2001
If M is a nonempty compact separated topological space (e.g., a bounded closed
subset of Rn), then the C∗-algebra C(M) knows a lot about the geometry of M.
For example, for a given point P, the set JP of all continuous functions
f : M →C
with f(P) = 0 forms a maximal C∗-ideal of C(M).184 Conversely, each maximal
C∗-ideal of C(M) can be obtained this way. Thus,
P →JP
is a bijective map between the space M and the set of maximal ideals of the function
algebra C(M). Furthermore, the Gelfand–Naimark structure theorem tells us that,
for each commutative C∗-algebra A, we have the C∗-isomorphism
A ≃C(M)
where M is the set of maximal C∗-ideals of A.
The basic idea of Connes’ noncommutative geometry is to replace commu-
tative C∗-algebras by noncommutative C∗-algebras.
In this setting, properties of noncommutative geometry are identiﬁed with prop-
erties of noncommutative C∗-algebras. This identiﬁcation is motivated by the cor-
responding identiﬁcation between classical geometric properties and properties of
commutative C∗-algebras. From the physical point of view, the idea is that states
and observables are primary, but space and time are secondary. For example, physi-
cists assume that space and time did not exist shortly after the Big Bang of our
universe, but only physical states existed. The familiar structure of our space-time
was only created later on by a stochastic process. Furthermore, below the Planck
length it is assumed that space and time loose their classical properties in the
setting of quantum gravity. Therefore, noncommutative geometry is one of the can-
didates for creating a mathematical theory of quantum gravity. Noncommutative
geometry is based on so-called spectral triplets for elliptic Dirac operators. As an
introduction to noncommutative geometry, we recommend:

ical Society 2006.

quantum gravity, pp. 127–150. In: B. Fauser, J. Tolksdorf, and E. Zeid-

Geometry, Birkh¨auser, Boston, 2001 (reprinted with permission).
184 This means that the C∗-ideal JP cannot be extended to a larger C∗-ideal of
C(M) which is diﬀerent from the trivial ideal C(M).

We also refer to the comprehensive monograph:

tive Geometry, Birkh¨auser, Boston, 2001.
A detailed study of the applications of noncommutative geometry to the Standard
Model in particle physics can be found in the comprehensive monograph:

In the 1930s, John von Neumann discovered that operator algebras play a funda-
mental role in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. Noncommu-
tative geometry stands in this tradition and allows us to approach the Standard
Model in elementary particle physics.
In 2006 the ﬁrst volume of the Journal of Noncommutative Geometry appeared.
The editor-in-chief is Alain Connes. The following list of topics covered by the
journal shows the scope of modern noncommutative geometry:
• operator algebras,
• Hochschild and cyclic cohomology,
• K-theory and index theory,
• measure theory and topology of noncommutative spaces,
• spectral geometry of noncommutative spaces,
• noncommutative algebraic geometry,
• Hopf algebras and quantum groups,
• foliations, gruppoids, stacks, gerbes,
• deformations and quantizations,
• noncommutative spaces in number theory and arithmetic geometry,
• noncommutative geometry in physics: quantum ﬁeld theory, renormalization,
gauge theory, string theory, gravity, mirror symmetry, solid state physics, sta-
tistical mechanics.
7.20 Jordan Algebras
Let O(X) denote the set of all observables in L(X, X) (i.e., the set of all linear
continuous self-adjoint operators A : X →X), where X is a complex Hilbert space.
If A, B ∈O(X), then the usual operator product AB is contained in O(X) iﬀ
AB = BA. This follows from
(AB)∗= B∗A∗= BA.
Thus, as a rule, O(X) is not an algebra with respect to the operator product. In
order to cure this defect, Pascal Jordan (1902–1980) introduced the product
A ◦B := 1
2(AB + BA).
Then the set O(X) becomes a real algebra with respect to the real linear com-
binations αA + βB and the Jordan product A ◦B. This commutative algebra of
observables is called the real Jordan algebra of the Hilbert space X. As a rule,
Jordan algebras are not associative.185 The theory of Jordan algebras is a branch

his contributions to Jordan algebras.
7.21 The Supersymmetric Harmonic Oscillator
The foundations of the theory of commuting and anticommuting variables
were laid by Schwinger in 1953, who presented the analysis for commuting
and anticommuting variables on the physical level of strictness187. . .
The ﬁrst mathematical formalism that made it possible to operate with
commuting and anticommuting coordinates was Martin’s algebraic formal-
ism proposed in 1959188. . .
In 1974, Salam and Strathdee proposed a very apt name for a set of su-
perpoints.189 After this work and the work by Wess and Zumino190 were
published, the superspace became a foundation for the most important
physical theories.191
Andrei Khrennikov, 1997
In contrast to Heisenberg’s harmonic quantum oscillator, the ground state
energy of the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator is equal to zero.
The golden rule of supersymmetry
Supersymmetry is a relativistic symmetry between bosons and fermions.
This is the only known way available at the present to unify the four-
dimensional space-time and internal symmetries of the S-matrix in rela-
tivistic particle theory. 192

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
En = ℏω(n + 1
2),
n = 0, 1, 2, . . .
(7.306)
As we will show below, the energy levels of the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator
are given by
Enb,nf = ℏω(nb + nf),
nb = 0, 1, 2, . . . , nf = 0, 1.
In terms of physics, this is the energy of nb bosons and nf fermions. The point is
that an inﬁnite number of bosonic harmonic oscillators has the ground state energy
∞
X
k=0
1
2ℏω = +∞.
This causes the main trouble in quantum ﬁeld theory. In contrast to this patholog-
ical situation, the ground state energy of an arbitrary number of supersymmetric
harmonic oscillators is equal to zero, since E0,0 = 0.
A supersymmetric harmonic oscillator is the superposition of a bosonic
harmonic oscillator and a fermionic harmonic oscillator. The nonzero
ground state energies of the two harmonic oscillators compensate each
other.
Because of the Pauli principle, it is not possible that two fermions are in the same
energy state of a harmonic oscillator. This motivates why the number nf of fermions
in an energy eigenstate only attains the values nf = 0, 1.
The supersymmetric Hamiltonian. Let us introduce the following Hamil-
tonians:
(B) Bosonic Hamiltonian: Hbosonic := ℏω(a†a + 1
2).
(F) Fermionic Hamiltonian: Hfermionic := ℏω(b†b −1
2).
(S) Supersymmetric Hamiltonian:
Hsuper := ℏω(a†a ⊗I + I ⊗b†b).
(7.307)
As a rule, physicists brieﬂy write Hsuper = ℏω(a†a + b†b).
Hilbert spaces. The bosonic Hamiltonian acts on the so-called bosonic Hilbert
space Xbosonic := L2(R) with the energy eigenstates
Hbosonic|nb⟩= Enb|nb⟩,
nb = 0, 1, 2, . . .
where Enb := ℏω(nb + 1
2). The bosonic eigenstates
|nb⟩,
nb = 0, 1, 2, . . .
form a complete orthonormal system on the Hilbert space Xbosonic. In terms of
physics, the state |nb⟩describes nb bosons.
The fermionic Hamiltonian acts on the Hilbert space Xfermionic := C2 with the
energy eigenstates
Hfermionic|nf⟩= Enf |nf⟩,
nf = 0, 1
where Enf := ℏω(nf −1
2). The explicit form of the states |0⟩and |1⟩will be given
below. The state |nf⟩corresponds to nf fermions.
Bosonic-fermionic states. Let us now introduce the Hilbert space

7.21 The Supersymmetric Harmonic Oscillator
665
Xsuper := Xbosonic ⊗Xfermionic.
The states
|nb⟩⊗|nf⟩,
nb = 0, 1, 2, . . . , nf = 0, 1
form a complete orthonormal system of Xsuper. In terms of physics, the state
|nb⟩⊗|nf⟩corresponds to nb bosons and nf fermions.193 For the supersymmet-
ric Hamiltonian, we get
Hsuper = Hbosonic ⊗Hfermionic.
This operator acts on the Hilbert space Xsuper. Explicitly,
Hsuper(|nb⟩⊗|nf⟩) = Hbosonic|nb⟩⊗|nf⟩+ |nb⟩⊗Hfermionic|nf⟩.
Hence
Hsuper(|nb⟩⊗|nf⟩) = Enb,nf (|nb⟩⊗|nf⟩)
along with the energies
Enb,nf := ℏω(nb + nf)
where nb = 0, 1, 2, . . . and nf = 0, 1. This implies that the ground state |0⟩⊗|0⟩of
the supersymmetric harmonic oscillator has zero energy, that is,
Hsuper(|0⟩⊗|0⟩) = 0.
Bosonic creation and annihilation operators. Set a−:= a and a+ := a†.
For the bosonic annihilation operator a−and the bosonic creation operator a+, we
have194
[a−, a+]−= I,
[a−, a−]−= [a+, a+]−= 0.
Furthermore, by Sect. 7.2 on page 432, for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . we have
a−|n + 1⟩=
√
n + 1 |n⟩,
a+|n⟩=
√
n + 1 |n + 1⟩.
Fermionic creation and annihilation operators. For the fermionic anni-
hilation operator b−and the fermionic creation operator b+, we get
[b−, b+]+ = I,
[b−, b−]+ = [b+, b+]+ = 0.
In particular, (b+)2 = (b−)2 = 0. Furthermore,
b−|0⟩= 0,
b−|1⟩= |0⟩,
b+|0⟩= |1⟩,
b+|1⟩= 0.
Explicitly, we set
|0⟩:=
 
1
0
!
,
|1⟩:=
 
0
1
!
.
The states |0⟩and |1⟩form a complete orthonormal system of the Hilbert space
Xfermionic. That is, each element χ ∈Xfermionic can be uniquely represented as
χ = α|0⟩+ β|1⟩,
α, β ∈C.
193 Physicists brieﬂy write |nb⟩|nf⟩.
194 Recall that [A, B]± := AB ± BA.

7. Quantization of the Harmonic Oscillator
In the language of matrices, χ =
 
α
β
!
. Moreover, we deﬁne
b−:=
 
0 1
0 0
!
,
b+ :=
 
0 0
1 0
!
,
N := b+b−=
 
0 0
0 1
!
.
Since N|0⟩= 0 and N|1⟩= |1⟩, the operator N is called the fermionic particle
number operator. Obviously, b+ is the adjoint matrix to b−, i.e., b+ = (b−)†.
Supersymmetric creation and annihilation operators. We want to write
the supersymmetric Hamiltonian in the form
Hsuper = ℏω(Q+Q−+ Q−Q+).
(7.308)
To this end, we introduce the operators
Q+ := a−⊗b+,
Q−:= a+ ⊗b−
called the supersymmetric creation operator Q+ and the supersymmetric annihila-
tion operator Q−. Explicitly,
Q+(|nb⟩⊗|nf⟩) = a−|nb⟩⊗b+|nf⟩
and
Q−(|nb⟩⊗|nf⟩) = a+|nb⟩⊗b−|nf⟩.
For example,
Q+(|1⟩⊗|0⟩) = |0⟩⊗|1⟩,
Q−(|0⟩⊗|1⟩) = |1⟩⊗|0⟩.
Thus, the operator Q+ sends one boson to one fermion (resp. the operator Q−sends
one fermion to one boson). We have
[Q+, Q+]+ = [Q−, Q−]+ = 0.
This is equivalent to (Q+)2 = (Q−)2 = 0. In fact,
Q+Q+ = (a−⊗b+)(a−⊗b+) = a−a−⊗b+b+ = 0,
since (b+)2 = 0. Similarly, we get (Q−)2 = 0.
Let us now prove (7.308). It follows from
Q+Q−= (a−⊗b+)(a+ ⊗b−) = a−a+ ⊗b+b−
together with a−a+ = I + a+a−that
Q+Q−= (I + a+a−) ⊗b+b−.
Similarly,
Q−Q+ = (a+ ⊗b−)(a−⊗b+) = a+a−⊗b−b+ = a+a−⊗(I −b+b−).
Therefore,
Q+Q−+ Q−Q+ = I ⊗b+b−+ a+a−⊗I.
This yields (7.307), (7.308).

Supersymmetric invariance of the supersymmetric Hamiltonian. We
claim that
[Hsuper, Q+]−= [Hsuper, Q−]−= 0.
To prove this, observe that Q+Q+ = 0. Hence
(Q+Q−+ Q−Q+)Q+ −Q+(Q+Q−+ Q−Q+) = Q+Q−Q+ −Q+Q−Q+ = 0.
This implies [Hsuper, Q+]−= 0. Similarly, [Hsuper, Q−]−= 0.
Perspective. Supersymmetry plays an important role in modern quantum ﬁeld
theory. We will come back to this in later volumes. There exists a huge amount of
literature on supersymmetric models in quantum theory. Some hints for further
reading can be found on page 679.

Problems
In the ﬁrst group of problems we want to show how to apply von Neumann’s theory
of self-adjoint (and essentially self-adjoint) operators to quantum mechanics. As
prototypes, we will study the position operator Q, the momentum operator P, and
the Hamiltonian Hfree of a free quantum particle on the real line in Problems 7.5
and 7.15–7.17. Further typical examples can be found in Problem 7.19. Observe
that in Problem 7.5, we will show that

The basic idea behind the notion of self-adjoint operator is the integration-
by-parts formula and the extension of the classical derivative for functions
to distributions (generalized functions).
The key observation is that the classical integration-by-parts formula for smooth
functions with compact support,
Z
R
ψ(x)ϕ′(x)dx = −
Z
R
ψ′(x)ϕ(x)dx
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈D(R),
(7.309)
remains valid if the derivatives ϕ′, ψ′ are to be understood in the sense of tempered
distributions and the functions ϕ, ψ, as well as ϕ′, ψ′ are contained in the Hilbert
space L2(R) of square-integrable functions (see Problem 7.3). This can be written
as
Z
R
ψ(x)ϕ′(x)dx = −
Z
R
ψ′(x)ϕ(x)dx
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈W 1
2 (R).
(7.310)
Let us introduce the two operators Apreϕ := ϕ′ for all ϕ ∈S(R) and
Aϕ := ϕ′
for all
ϕ ∈W 1
2 (R).
Using the inner product ⟨f|g⟩:=
R
R f(x)†g(x)dx on the Hilbert space L2(R), we
get
⟨ψ|Apreϕ⟩= −⟨Aψ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈S(R), ψ ∈W 1
2 (R).
(7.311)
Setting Ppre := −iℏApre and P := −iℏA, formula (7.311) implies
(i) ⟨ψ|Ppreϕ⟩= ⟨Ppreψ|ϕ⟩
for all ϕ, ψ ∈S(R),
(ii) ⟨ψ|Ppreϕ⟩= ⟨Pψ|ϕ⟩
for all ϕ ∈S(R), ψ ∈W 1
2 (R), and
(iii) ⟨ψ|Pϕ⟩= ⟨Pψ|ϕ⟩
for all ϕ, ψ ∈W 1
2 (R).
The three formulas (i)–(iii) display the basic ideas of von Neumann’s functional-
analytic theory for self-adjoint operators. We will show in Problem 7.5 that the
formulas (i)–(iii) imply that P ∗
pre = P = P ∗. In the general case, let us consider the
linear operator
A : D(A) →X
(7.312)
whose domain of deﬁnition D(A) is a linear dense subspace of the complex Hilbert
space X. The linearity of A means that
A(αϕ + βψ) = αAϕ + βAψ
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈D(A), α, β ∈C.
The density of the set D(A) in the Hilbert space X means that, for any element
ϕ ∈X, there exists a sequence (ϕn) in D(A) such that limn→∞ϕn = ϕ in X.
Suppose that we are given two operators B : D(B) →X and C : D(C) →X,
where D(B) and D(C) are subsets of the space X.
• We write B = C iﬀD(B) = D(C) and Aϕ = Bϕ for all ϕ ∈D(A).
• We write B ⊆C iﬀthe operator B : D(B) →X is an extension of the operator
C, that is, we have D(A) ⊆D(B) ⊆X and Aϕ = Bϕ for all ϕ ∈D(A).

7.2 The Sobolev space W 1
2 (R). By deﬁnition, the function ϕ : R →C is contained
in the space W 1
2 (R) iﬀϕ ∈L2(R), and the derivative ϕ′ (in the sense of
distributions) is also contained in L2(R). This means that

(iii) The sets D(R) and S(R) are proper linear subspaces of the Sobolev space

Hint: Use Problem 7.1. Concerning (iii), note that the function ϕ(x) := |x|e−x2
has a derivative on the pointed set R \ {0} which is square integrable. Hence
ϕ ∈W 1
2 (R), but ϕ /∈S(R). The proofs can be found in Zeidler (1986), Vol.
IIA, Chap. 21 (see the references on page 1049), together with much additional
material.
7.3 Integration by parts. Prove that the generalized integration-by-parts formula
(7.310) holds true.
Solution: Let ϕ, ψ ∈W 1
2 (R). Since D(R) is dense in the Hilbert space W 1
2 (R),
there exist sequences (ϕn) and (ψn) in D(R) such that ϕn →ϕ and ψn →ψ
in W 1
2 (R) as n →∞. This means that

7.4 The adjoint operator. The linear operator A† : D(A) →X is called the formally
adjoint operator to the linear operator A from (7.312) iﬀ
⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨A†ψ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈D(A).
The operator A : D(A) →X is called formally self-adjoint (or symmetric) iﬀ
⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨Aψ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈D(A).
The more sophisticated deﬁnition of the adjoint operator A∗: D(A∗) →X is
based on the formula
⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨A∗ψ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈D(A), ψ ∈D(A∗).
(7.313)
More precisely, we ﬁrst deﬁne the set D(A∗). The element ψ is contained in
D(A∗) iﬀthere exists an element χ in X such that
⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨χ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈D(A).
We then deﬁne A∗ψ := χ. This yields (7.313). The following two deﬁnitions
are basic for quantum mechanics. Let A : D(A) →X be a formally self-adjoint
operator of the form (7.312).
• The operator A is called self-adjoint iﬀA = A∗.
• The operator A is called essentially self-adjoint iﬀit has precisely one self-
adjoint extension.
Show that the following hold:
(i) Both the formally adjoint operator A† and the adjoint operator A∗are
uniquely determined by the given operator A.
(ii) The adjoint operator A∗is linear.
(iii) If the formally adjoint operator A† exists, then A† ⊆A∗, that is, the
operator A∗is an extension of A†.
(iv) The operator A is formally self-adjoint iﬀA ⊆A∗.
Hint: We refer to Zeidler (1995a), Sect. 5.2 (see the references on page 1049).
7.5 The prototype of a self-adjoint diﬀerential operator. Deﬁne
Ppreϕ := −iℏϕ′
for all
ϕ ∈S(R),
and
Pϕ := −iℏϕ′
for all
ϕ ∈W 1
2 (R).
In the latter equation, the derivative is to be understood in the sense of tem-
pered distributions. Note that ϕ ∈W 1
2 (R) implies Pϕ ∈L2(R). Prove the
following:
(i) The operator Ppre : S(R) →L2(R) is formally self-adjoint.
(ii) The adjoint operator P ∗
pre coincides with P.
(iii) The operator P : W 1
2 (R) →L2(R) is self-adjoint.
(iv) Ppre ⊆P ∗∗
pre = P ∗
pre = P.

7. Quantization of the harmonic oscillator
(v) The closure P pre of Ppre coincides with P ∗∗
pre (see Problem 7.9).
Solution: Set ℏ:= 1. By Problem 7.3,
Z
R
ψ†(−iϕ′)dx =
Z
R
(−iψ′)†ϕdx
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈W 1
2 (R).
(7.314)
Ad (i). By (7.314), ⟨ψ|Ppreϕ⟩= ⟨Ppreψ|ϕ⟩for all ϕ, ψ ∈S(R).
Ad (ii). By deﬁnition of the adjoint operator P ∗
pre, we have χ = P ∗
preψ iﬀ
ψ, χ ∈L2(R) and
⟨ψ|Ppreϕ⟩= ⟨χ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Equivalently,
Z
R
ψ†(−iϕ′)dx =
Z
R
χ†ϕdx
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Passing over to conjugate complex values and setting ϱ := −iϕ†, we get
Z
R
ψ(−ϱ′)dx =
Z
R
(iχ)ϱdx
for all
ϱ ∈S(R).
This means that
d
dxψ = iχ, in the sense of tempered distributions. Hence
ψ ∈W 1
2 (R), and χ = −i d
dxψ. Therefore, χ = Pψ.
Ad (iii). By (7.314), ⟨ψ|Pϕ⟩= ⟨Pψ|ϕ⟩for all ϕ, ψ ∈W 1
2 (R). Hence the operator
P is formally self-adjoint. Suppose that, for ﬁxed ψ, χ ∈L2(R), we have
⟨ψ|Pϕ⟩= ⟨χ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈W 1
2 (R).
The same argument as in (ii) above shows that Pψ = χ. Hence P ∗ψ = Pψ for
all ψ ∈W 1
2 (R).
Ad (iv). By deﬁnition, Ppre ⊆P. By (ii), (iii), we get P ∗
pre = P and P ∗= P.
Ad (v). Let (ϕn) be a sequence in D(Ppre) with
lim
n→∞ϕn = ϕ,
lim
n→∞Ppreϕn = χ.
(7.315)
Then P preψ = χ. Letting n →∞, it follows from
⟨ϱ|Ppreϕn⟩= ⟨Pϱ|ϕn⟩
for all
ϱ ∈S(R)
that ⟨ϱ|χ⟩= ⟨Pϱ|ϕ⟩for all ϱ ∈S(R). Hence χ = Pϕ.
Conversely, if χ = Pϕ, then there exists a sequence (ϕn) in S(R) with (7.315),
by Problem 7.2(ii). Summarizing, Pϕ = Pϕ for all ϕ ∈W 1
2 (R).
7.6 Closed operators. The subset
graph(A) := {(ϕ, Aϕ) : ϕ ∈D(A)}
of the product space X × X is called the graph of the operator A from (7.312).
The operator A is deﬁned to be closed iﬀthe set graph(A) is closed in X × X.
This means that if there exists a sequence (ϕn) in D(A) with the convergence
property
lim
n→∞ϕn = ϕ
and
lim
n→∞Aϕn = ψ,

Problems
685
then ϕ ∈D(A) and Aϕ = ψ. This generalizes the notion of continuity.199 Show
that the adjoint operator A∗: D(A) →X from Problem 7.4 is closed.
Solution: Let ϕn ∈D(A∗) for all n, and let
lim
n→∞ϕn = ϕ
and
lim
n→∞A∗ϕn = ψ.
Then ⟨A∗ϕn|χ⟩= ⟨ϕn|Aχ⟩. Letting n →∞, we get
⟨ψ|χ⟩= ⟨ϕ|Aχ⟩
for all
χ ∈D(A).
Hence ϕ ∈D(A∗) and ψ = A∗ϕ.
7.7 The crucial symmetry criterion for self-adjoint operators. Prove that the linear,
densely deﬁned operator A : D(A) →X on the complex Hilbert space X is
self-adjoint iﬀthe following two conditions are satisﬁed:
(i) ⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨Aψ|ϕ⟩for all ϕ, ψ ∈D(A).
(ii) If ⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨χ|ϕ⟩for ﬁxed ψ, χ ∈X and all ϕ ∈D(A), then ψ ∈D(A).
Solution: (I) ⇒: Assume that A is self-adjoint. Then A = A∗. This implies (i).
If ⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨χ|ϕ⟩for all ϕ ∈D(A), then ψ ∈D(A∗). Hence ψ ∈D(A).
(II) ⇐: Assume that (i) and (ii) hold. By (i), A ⊆A∗. In order to show A∗⊆A,
let ψ ∈D(A∗). Then
⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨A∗ψ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈D(A).
By (ii), ψ ∈D(A). It follows from (i) that ⟨A∗ψ|ϕ⟩= ⟨Aψ|ϕ⟩. Hence
⟨A∗ψ −Aψ|ϕ⟩= 0
for all
ϕ ∈D(A).
Since D(A) is dense in X, we get A∗ψ = Aψ.

In the following problems we want to show that
The properties of self-adjointness and essential self-adjointness are
closely related to natural extension properties of formally self-adjoint
operators A based on the inclusions A ⊆A ⊆A∗, where A denotes the
closure of A. In addition, A = A∗∗.
7.8 Maximal extension and the adjoint operator. Let A : D(A) →X be a formally
self-adjoint operator of the form (7.312). Show the following:
(i) There exists a maximal linear extension B : D(B) →X of A with
⟨ψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨Bψ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈D(A), ψ ∈D(B).
This maximal extension B is equal to the adjoint operator A∗.
(ii) The operator A is self-adjoint iﬀthe maximal extension B coincides with
A, that is, B = A.
Hint: Convince yourself that this is merely a reformulation of the basic deﬁni-
tions.
7.9 Minimal extension and the closure. Let A : D(A) →X be a formally self-
adjoint operator of the form (7.312). Show that the operator A can be mini-
mally extended to a linear, closed, formally self-adjoint operator. This operator
is denoted by A : D(A) →X, and it is called the closure of A.
Hint: Let Dcl be the set of all ϕ ∈X for which a sequence (ϕn) exists in D(A)
such that
199 Banach’s closed graph theorem tells us the crucial fact that a linear closed opera-
tor A : X →X deﬁned on the total Hilbert space X is continuous. However, the
self-adjoint Hamiltonian operators arising in quantum mechanics are not deﬁned
on the total Hilbert space; as a rule, they are not continuous, but they are closed.

7. Quantization of the harmonic oscillator
• limn→∞ϕn = ϕ and
• (Aϕn) is convergent, that is, limn→∞Aϕn = ψ.
Letting n →∞, it follows from ⟨χ|Aϕn⟩= ⟨Aχ|ϕn⟩that
⟨χ|ψ⟩= ⟨Aχ|ϕ⟩
for all
χ ∈D(A).
Since D(A) is dense in X, the element ψ of X is uniquely determined by ϕ.
Now we set Aϕ := ψ and D(A) := Dcl. Since
⟨χ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨Aχ|ϕ⟩
for all
χ ∈D(A), ϕ ∈D(A),
(7.316)
we get A ⊆A ⊆A∗. Let ϱ ∈D(A). Then there exists a sequence (ϱn) in
D(A) such that limn→∞χn = ϱ. Considering (7.316) with χ := ϱn and letting
n →∞, we obtain
⟨ϱ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨Aϱ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϱ, ϕ ∈D(A).
Thus, the operator A is formally self-adjoint. Finally, it remains to show that
the operator A is closed (see H. Triebel, Higher Analysis, Sect. 17, Barth,
Leipzig, 1989).
7.10 Properties of the closure. Let A : D(A) →X and B : D(B) →X be formally
self-adjoint operators of the form (7.312) on page 681. Show the following:
(i) A ⊆B implies A ⊆B and B∗⊆A∗.
(ii) A ⊆A ⊆A∗.
(iii) A = A∗∗and (A)∗= A∗.
(iii) The operator A is essentially self-adjoint iﬀthe closure A is self-adjoint.
Hint: We refer to Zeidler (1995a), p. 415ﬀ(see the references on page 1049).
7.11 General properties of self-adjoint operators. For the formally self-adjoint op-
erator A of the form (7.312), the following statements are equivalent:
(i) The operator A is self-adjoint.
(ii) All the non-real numbers z belong to the resolvent set ϱ(A).
(iv) im(±iI −A) = X.
(iv) The operator A is closed and ker(±iI −A∗) = {0}.
(v) The operator A is essentially self-adjoint and closed.
Hint: See Zeidler (1995a), p. 416.
7.12 General properties of essentially self-adjoint operators. For the formally self-
adjoint operator operator A of the form (7.312), the following statements are
equivalent:
(i) The operator A is essentially self-adjoint.
(ii) The closure A is self-adjoint.
(iv) The two sets im(±iI −A) are dense in X.
(iii) ker(±iI −A∗) = {0}.
Hint: See Zeidler (1995a), p. 424.
7.13 Further properties of essentially self-adjoint operators. Let A : D(A) →X
be a linear, formally self-adjoint, and densely deﬁned operator on the complex
Hilbert space X. Assume that the operator A is essentially self-adjoint, and let
B : D(B) →X be the uniquely determined self-adjoint extension of A. Prove
that
A∗= A = A∗∗= B.
(7.317)
Solution: By Problem 7.10, B = A. Moreover, A = A∗∗and A∗= (A)∗= A.

7.14 Unitary invariance. The linear operator A : D(A) →X is said to be unitarily
equivalent to the linear operator B : D(B) →X iﬀthere exists a unitary
operator U : X →Y from the complex Hilbert space X onto the complex
Hilbert space Y such that the diagram

self-adjoint, self-adjoint, essentially self-adjoint, and closed.
Hint: Use the corresponding deﬁnitions.
7.15 The position operator on the real line. Set
D(Q) := {ϕ ∈L2(R) :
Z
R
|xϕ(x)|2dx < ∞}.
Fix x ∈R. Deﬁne (Qpreϕ)(x) := xϕ(x) for all ϕ ∈S(R), and (Qϕ)(x) := xϕ(x)
for all ϕ ∈D(Q). Prove the following:
(i) The operator Qpre : S(R) →L2(R) is formally self-adjoint.
(ii) The operator Q : D(Q) →L2(R) is self-adjoint.
(iii) The operator Qpre : S(R) →L2(R) is essentially self-adjoint, but not
self-adjoint.
(iv) Q∗
pre = Qpre = Q∗∗
pre = Q.
Solution: Ad (i). For all ϕ, ψ ∈S(R),
Z
R
(xψ(x))†ϕ(x)dx =
Z
ψ(x)†xϕ(x)dx.
Ad(ii), (iii). For given function f ∈L2(R), the equation
± iϕ −Qϕ = f,
ϕ ∈D(Q)
(7.318)
has the unique solution ϕ(x) :=
f(x)
±i−x for all x ∈R. In fact, |ϕ(x)| ≤const|f(x)|
for all x ∈R. This implies ϕ ∈L2(R). Hence ϕ ∈D(Q). Thus, we get the key
relation im(±iI −Q) = L2(R), that is, Q is self-adjoint.
In particular, if f ∈S(R), then the solution of equation (7.318) is contained in
S(R). Since the set S(R) is dense in L2(R), the sets im(±I −Qpre) are dense
in L2(R). Therefore, the operator Qpre is essentially self-adjoint.
Finally, note that the set D(Qpre) = S(R) diﬀers from D(Q). For example,
choose ψ(x) := |x|e−x2. Then ψ ∈D(Q), but ψ /∈S(R).
Ad (iv). Use Problem 7.13.

±iϕ −Pϕ = f,
ϕ ∈S(R)
(7.319)
in order to prove the following:

7. Quantization of the harmonic oscillator
(i) The operator Ppre : S(R) →L2(R) is formally self-adjoint.
(ii) The operator P : W 1
2 (R) →L2(R) is self-adjoint.
(iii) The operator Ppre : S(R) →L2(R) is essentially self-adjoint, but not
self-adjoint.
(iv) P ∗
pre = P pre = P ∗∗
pre = P.
Solution: Ad (i). See Problem 7.5.
Ad (ii), (iii). For given f ∈S(R), the equation (7.319) has a unique solution
ϕ ∈S(R). In fact, Fourier transformation yields
±i ˆϕ(p) −ℏp ˆϕ(p) = ˆf(p),
p ∈R.
This yields ˆϕ(p) =
ˆ
f(p)
±i−ℏp which is contained in S(R). Then the inverse Fourier
transform yields the desired solution ϕ of (7.319). Since the set S(R) is dense
in L2(R), the image set im(±I −Ppre) is dense in L2(R). Consequently, the
operator Ppre : S(R) →L2(R) is essentially self-adjoint. Thus, it has a unique
self-adjoint extension.
Using the extended Fourier transform F : L2(R) →L2(R) together with
Problem 7.2(iv), the same argument as above shows that, for given function
f ∈L2(R), the equation
±iϕ −Pϕ = f,
ϕ ∈W 1
2 (R)
has a (unique) solution ϕ. Hence im(±iI −P) = L2(R). Consequently, the
operator P : W 1
2 (R) →L2(R) is self-adjoint. Furthermore, the operator P is
the unique self-adjoint extension of the operator Ppre. Since S(R) ̸= W 1
2 (R),
the operator Ppre diﬀers from P.
Ad (iv). Use Problem 7.13.
Historical remarks. The importance of equations of the type (7.319) for the
study of the spectral properties of ordinary diﬀerential equations was discovered
by Weyl in 1910 and developed by von Neumann in his 1929 theory of deﬁciency
indices.

Hint: Apply integration by parts twice, and use analogous arguments as in
Problem 7.7.
7.18 Deﬁciency indices and von Neumann’s extension theorem for self-adjoint op-
erators. Let A : D(A) →X be a linear, formally self-adjoint, densely deﬁned,
and closed operator on the complex Hilbert space X. The numbers
d± := dim (±iI −A)⊥
are called the deﬁciency indices of the operator A.200 Prove the following:
(i) The operator A has a self-adjoint extension iﬀd+ = d−.
(ii) The operator A is self-adjoint iﬀd+ = d−= 0.
Hint: Use the Cayley transform in order to reduce this to the extension problem
for isometric operators (see Problems 7.22 and 7.23).
7.19 Formally self-adjoint operators which have no self-adjoint extension or in-
ﬁnitely many self-adjoint extensions. Consider the operator
Aϕ := −iℏdϕ
dx
for all
ϕ ∈D(A)
where D(A) is a linear dense subspace of the complex Hilbert space X. We will
choose X := L2(0, ∞) or X := L2(0, 1). We want to show that the properties
of the operator A critically depend on the choice of the domain of deﬁnition
D(A). In turn, this depends on the choice of boundary conditions. Show that
the following hold:
(i) Choose D(A) := D(0, ∞) and X := L2(0, ∞). 201 Then the operator A is
formally self-adjoint, but it cannot be extended to a self-adjoint operator.
(ii) Fix the complex number α with |α| = 1 and α ̸= 1. Choose202
D(A) := {ϕ ∈C1[0, 1] : ϕ(0) = αϕ(1)}
and X = L2(0, 1). Then the operator A is essentially self-adjoint.
(iii) Choose D(A) := {ϕ ∈C1[0, 1] : ϕ(0) = ϕ(1) = 0} and X := L2(0, 1).
Then the operator A is formally self-adjoint, but its closure A is not self-
adjoint. However, the operator has an inﬁnite number of self-adjoint ex-
tensions given by the operators from (ii).
Hint: Ad (i). Set ℏ:= 1. Integration by parts yields
⟨χ|Aϕ⟩=
Z ∞
0
χ†(−iϕ′)dx =
Z ∞
0
(−iχ′)†ϕdx = ⟨Aχ|ϕ⟩
for all χ, ϕ ∈D(0, ∞). Thus, the operator A is formally self-adjoint. Now ﬁx
the non-real complex number z and study the equation A −zI = f, that is
−iϕ′ −zϕ = f,
ϕ ∈D(0, ∞).
(7.320)
200 If L is a linear subspace of X, then the orthogonal complement L⊥consists of
all the elements ϕ of X which are orthogonal to L.
201 Recall that ϕ ∈D(0, ∞) iﬀthe function ϕ :]0, ∞[→C is smooth with compact
support (i.e., it vanishes outside some interval [a, b] with 0 < a < b < ∞). Then
the function ϕ satisﬁes the boundary condition ϕ(0) = ϕ(+∞) = 0.
202 The space Ck[0, 1], k = 1, 2, . . . consists of all continuous functions ϕ : [0, 1] →C
which have continuous derivatives on the open interval ]0, 1[ up to order k, and
all of these derivatives can be continuously extended to the closed interval [0, 1].

We are given f ∈L2(0, ∞). If ϕ is a solution of (7.320), then

Integration by parts tells us that
Z ∞

e−izxf(x)dx = 0.
(7.321)
Choosing z := −i, we get e−izx = e−x. Then condition (7.321) is satisﬁed for
all f ∈L2(0, ∞). In contrast to this, if z := i, then e−izx = ex, and condition
(7.321) is not valid for all f ∈L2(0, ∞). Use this observation in order to show
that the deﬁciency indices of A are given by d−= 0 and d+ ̸= 0. By von
Neumann’s deﬁciency-index criterion (see Problem 7.18), the operator A has
no self-adjoint extension.
For the complete proof of (i)–(iii), see P. Lax, Functional Analysis, Chap. 33,
Wiley, New York, 2002.
7.20 Continuity and boundedness. Show that, for the linear operator A : X →X on
the (real or complex) Hilbert space X, the following statements are equivalent:
(i) The operator A is continuous, that is, for any ﬁxed element ϕ0 ∈X and
any number ε > 0, there exists a number δ(ε, ϕ0) > 0 such that
||ϕ −ϕ0|| < δ(ε, ϕ0)
implies
||Aϕ −Aϕ0|| < ε.
(ii) The operator is sequentially continuous, that is, limn→∞ϕn = ϕ implies
limn→∞Aϕn = Aϕ.
(iii) The operator A is bounded, that is, ||A|| := sup||ϕ||≤1 ||Aϕ|| < ∞.
Hint: We refer to Zeidler (1995a), Sect. 1.9 (see the references on page 1049).
7.21 Extension of a linear, densely deﬁned, bounded operator. Let A : D(A) →Y
be a linear operator, where D(A) is a linear dense subspace of the complex
(resp. real) Hilbert space X, and Y is also a complex (resp. real) Hilbert space.
Suppose that
||Aψ|| ≤const ||ψ||
for all
ψ ∈D(A).
Show that the operator A can be uniquely extended to a linear bounded oper-
ator A : X →Y. This statement remains true if X and Y are complex (resp.
real) Banach spaces.
Hint: Let ψ ∈X. Choose a sequence (ψn) in D(A) with ψ = limn→∞ψn.
Using the Cauchy criterion, show that the sequence (Aψn) is convergent. Set
Aψ := limn→∞Aψn. Finally, show that Aψ is independent of the choice of the
sequence (ψn). We refer to Zeidler (1995a), Sect. 3.6 (see the references on page
1049).
7.22 Extension of isometric operators. Let A : D(A) →X be a linear isometric
operator on the linear subspace D(A) of the complex Hilbert space X, that
is, ⟨Aψ|Aϕ⟩= ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩for all ϕ, ψ ∈D(A). Show that the operator A can be
extended to a unitary operator U : X →X iﬀdim D(A)⊥= dim im(A)⊥.
Hint: (I) Assume ﬁrst that D(A) is a closed linear subspace of the separable
Hilbert space X. Let dim D(A)⊥= dim im(A)⊥. Set
Uϕj := ψj
for all
j,
where ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . (resp. ψ1, ψ2, . . . ) is an orthonormal basis in D(A)⊥(resp.

(II) If D(A) is not closed, then consider the closure Dcl of D(A). This is a
closed linear subspace of X. By Problem 7.21, the operator A can be uniquely
extended to a linear isometric operator B : Dcl →X. Now apply argument (I)
to the extension B.
(III) If the Hilbert space X is not separable, then replace ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . (resp.
ψ1, ψ2, . . . ) by a generalized orthonormal basis, by using the Zorn lemma. As
in Problem 7.19, see Lax (2002), Sect. 6.4.
7.23 The Cayley transform. The classical M¨obius transformation
f(z) := z −i
z + i,
z ∈R
generates a conformal map from the real line onto the unit circle. Generalizing
this, we obtain the Cayley transformation
CA := (A −iI)(A + iI)−1
which was used for matrices A by Cayley.203 In the late 1920s, von Neumann
generalized this to operators in Hilbert spaces in order to solve the extension
problem for self-adjoint operators (see Problem 7.18). Let A : D(A) →X
be a linear, formally self-adjoint operator on the linear subspace D(A) of the
complex Hilbert space X. Show the following:
(i) dom(CA) = im(A + iI) and im(CA) = im(A −iI).
(ii) The operator CA is isometric.
(iii) CA is unitary on X iﬀA is self-adjoint.
(iv) CA is closed iﬀA is closed.
(v) Let B : D(B) →X be linear and formally self-adjoint. Then, A ⊆B iﬀ
CA ⊆CB.
(vi) If A is closed, then dom(CA) and im(CA) are closed linear subspaces of
the Hilbert space X.

7.24 Polar decomposition. Each complex number z allows the polar decomposition
z = ur with r := |z| and u = eiϕ. Here, |u| = 1. We want to generalize this to
operators. Let A : D(A) →X be a linear (resp. antilinear), densely deﬁned,
closed operator on the complex Hilbert space X (e.g., a linear continuous op-
erator A : X →X.) Show the following:
(i) There exists a factorization
A = UR
where R : D(R) →X is a linear self-adjoint operator with D(R) = D(A), and
⟨ψ|Rψ⟩≥0 for all ψ ∈D(R). In addition, ker(R) = ker(A). Moreover, the
operator U : X →X is linear (resp. antilinear) and the restriction
U : ker(A)⊥→cl(im(A))
is unitary (resp. antiunitary), whereas ker(U) = ker(A). Explicitly, R =
√
A∗A.
The operator R is also called the absolute value of A (denoted by |A|). In
particular, if the operator A : X →X is linear (resp. antilinear), continuous,
and bijective, then the operator U : X →X is unitary (resp. antiunitary).
(ii) The operators R and U are uniquely determined by the properties formu-
lated in (i).

7.25 The theorem of Rolle on the zeros of functions. Show the following for smooth
functions f : R →R:204
(i) If f(a) = f(c) = 0 with a < c, then there exists a number b with a < b < c
such that f ′(b) = 0.
(ii) If f(c) = 0 and limx→+∞f(x) = 0, then there exists a number d > c such
that f ′(d) = 0.
(iii) Let n ≥1. If the function f has at least n zeros on the compact interval
J, then the derivative f ′ has at least n −1 zeros on J. If, in addition, the
function f goes to zero as x →+∞and x →−∞, then f ′ has at least
n + 1 zeros on R.
Solution: Ad (i). By the classical mean theorem in calculus,
f(c) −f(a) = f ′(b)(c −a)
for some b ∈]a, c[.
Ad (ii). Since f(x) =
R x
c f ′(y)dy, we get
Z ∞
c
f ′(y)dy =
lim
x→+∞f(x) = 0.
Suppose that the function f ′ has no zeros on the interval ]c, ∞[. Then, f ′ has
constant sign on this interval, by the Bolzano theorem. Hence the integral of
f ′ over [c, ∞[ does not vanish, a contradiction.
Ad (iii). For n = 1 the statement is trivial. Let n ≥2. Suppose that f(xj) = 0
for j = 1, 2, ..., n with
x1 < x2 < ... < xn.
By (ii), there exist numbers y1, y2, ... with
x1 < y1 < x2 < ... < xn−1 < yn−1 < xn
such that f ′(yk) = 0 for k = 1, ..., n −1. In addition, if f(x) →0 as x →+∞,
then there exists a number yn > xn such that f ′(yn) = 0, by (ii). Similarly, it
follows from f(x) →0 as x →−∞that there exists a number y−1 < x1 such
that f ′(y−1) = 0.
7.26 The zeros of the Hermite polynomials. Show that, for n = 0, 1, 2, ..., the Her-
mite polynomial Hn of order n has precisely n zeros.205
Solution: Set Hn(x) := (−1)ne−x2Hn(x). By (7.7) on page 436,
Hn(x) = dne−x2
dxn
,
n = 0, 1, 2, ...
Note that Hn is a polynomial of degree n. Thus, the maximal number of real
zeros of Hn is equal to n. Moreover, Hn(x) →0 as x →±∞for n = 0, 1, 2, , ...
Using the recursive formula
204 The French mathematician Michel Rolle (1652–1719) investigated the zeros of
polynomials in his 1690 treatise Trait´e d’alg`ebre.
205 This implies that the n zeros of Hn are simple.

and Problem 7.25, we proceed by induction. The function H0(x) = 1 has no
zeros. The polynomial H1 of ﬁrst order has precisely one zero. Now suppose
that the polynomial Hn has n real zeros. Then, the function Hn has also n
zeros. By Problem 7.25(iii), Hn+1 has n +1 zeros. In turn, Hn+1 has n + 1 real
zeros.

t ∈R
is not smooth. This is the reason for the failing of the Fourier transform, in
the classical sense. However, since |f| is bounded, the function f is a tempered
distribution, and its Fourier transform is well deﬁned. Thus, we may regard
equation (7.323) as a short-hand notation for the Fourier transform in the sense
of tempered distributions. To reﬁne this argument, note that

the partial derivatives of J on the interior of σM, we get Jpm = −ln pm −1
and
Jpmpn = −δmn
pm ,
m, n = 1, . . . , M.
Thus, the symmetric matrix (−Jpmpn) is positive deﬁnite on the interior of
σM, and hence the function −J is convex, that is, J is concave on the interior
of σM. By continuity, this remains true on σM. One checks easily that the
maximal value of J is attained at an inner point of σM. From Jpm = 0 for
m = 1, . . . , M, we get p1 = . . . = pM.

8. Quantum Particles on the Real Line –
Ariadne’s Thread in Scattering Theory
The S-Matrix knows all about scattering processes and bound states of
quantum particles.
Folklore
The S-Matrix is the most important quantity in elementary particle physics. The
fundamental role played by the S-matrix was emphasized by Heisenberg in 1943.1
He was motivated by the following philosophy:
Use only such quantities in quantum physics which are closely related to
physical experiments.
In fact, the S-matrix encodes transition probabilities in scattering experiments. This
way, one obtains the cross sections for scattering processes which can be measured
in particle accelerators. Interestingly enough, scattering experiments also give in-
formation about bound states by using the poles of the S-matrix. It is also possible
to detect unstable particles (also called resonances in particle physics) by carrying
out scattering experiments. In the present chapter, we will explain the basic ideas
of scattering theory by studying very simple models.
8.1 Classical Dynamics Versus Quantum Dynamics
In our solar system, there exist two diﬀerent types of motions:
(a) Planets (and some comets) move on bounded orbits (Fig. 8.1(a)).
(b) In addition, there exist comets which move on unbounded orbits (Fig. 8.1(b)).
Concerning (b), the motion is asymptotically free in the remote past (i.e., t →−∞)
and in the distant future (i.e., t →+∞). We speak of bound states (a) and scatter-
ing states (b). It turns out that the distinction between bound states and asymp-
totically free states (also called scattering states) is of fundamental importance in
elementary particle physics. For example, consider the electron of a hydrogen atom
which moves around the proton.
• The planets correspond to bound states of the electron. In contrast to celestial
mechanics, the energies E1, E2, . . . of bound states are discrete. More precisely,
−∞< E1 < E2 < . . . < 0.
• The asymptotically free moving comets correspond to the scattering of electrons
by the proton. The possible energies of the scattered electrons ﬁll the inﬁnite
interval [0, ∞[.

Fig. 8.1. Classiﬁcation of states
The distinction between bound states and scattering states is closely related to the
spectral theory of self-adjoint operators in Hilbert spaces. Roughly speaking, we
have the following situation:
• The possible energy values of a quantum particle form the spectrum of the Hamil-
tonian H : D(H) →X in the Hilbert space X. Here, H is a self-adjoint operator
in X.
• The energy values of the bound states form the discrete spectrum of H.
• The energy values of the scattering states form the absolutely continuous spec-
trum of H.
The Hilbert space X allows the following orthogonal decomposition
X = X1 ⊕X2.
The closed subspace X1 of X has an orthonormal basis ϕ1, ϕ2, . . . with
Hϕj = Ejϕj
for all
j.
The elements of X1 (resp. X2) are called bound states (resp. scattering states). In
particular, each eigenvector ϕj represents a bound state with energy Ej. For given
initial state ψ(0) ∈X, the dynamics of the particle is given by
ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ(0)
for all
t ∈R.
For the dynamics, we have the following situation:
• If ψ(0) ∈X1, then ψ = ψ(t) represents a bound motion of the quantum particle.
• If ψ(0) ∈X2, then the motion ψ = ψ(t) represents a scattering process for
the quantum particle. Intuitively, this is the motion of a wave packet which is
asymptotically free as time goes to +∞and −∞.
In particle accelerators, the incoming particles form a homogeneous stream of ﬁxed
particle energy E. Such a particle stream is described by a current density vector.
Note the following:
• Current densities do not live in the Hilbert space X, but they are costates of X
(i.e., they are functionals on X).
• In terms of the Schr¨odinger equation, bound states ϕj of energy Ej are normal-
ized functions, that is,
Z
R3 |ϕj(x)|2d3x = 1.

8.1 Classical Dynamics Versus Quantum Dynamics
701
• The current densities ϕ are described by eigenfunctions of the Schr¨odinger equa-
tion which cannot be normalized, that is, Hϕ = Eϕ, and
Z
R3 |ϕ(x)|2d3x = ∞.
Such eigenfunctions are called generalized eigenfunctions.
Motion of a classical particle. Let us study a simple example. Consider the
motion x = x(t) of a classical particle of mass m on the real line governed by the
following equation of motion
m¨x(t) = −U ′(x(t)).
(8.1)
Assume ﬁrst that the potential U : R →R is smooth. Then, for each solution of
(8.1), there exists a real number E such that
m ˙x(t)2
2
+ U(x(t)) = E
for all times t ∈R.
(8.2)
The number E represents the energy of the motion. Hence
U(x(t)) ≤E
for all
t ∈R.
This restricts the possible motions of the particle. In fact, for given energy E, the
motion of the particle is only possible in the subset
{x ∈R : U(x) ≤E}
of the real line. Now we consider the special case where the potential is given by
the following function
U(x) :=
(
U0
if
−r ≤x ≤r,
0
otherwise.
(8.3)
Here, r > 0. In this case, the potential U is piecewise continuous. By a solution
x = x(t) of the equation of motion (8.1), we understand a solution in the sense of
distributions.2 In addition, we assume that x = x(t) is continuous and piecewise
continuously diﬀerentiable on the time interval ] −∞, ∞[, and it satisﬁes equation
(8.2) for ﬁxed real energy E and all points in time where the velocity function
t →˙x(t) is continuous. It turns out that the velocity v of the particle is piecewise
constant. If v > 0 (resp. v < 0), then the particle moves from left to right (resp.
from right to left). We have to distinguish the following cases.
(i) Free motion: U0 = 0. For given energy E > 0, the particle moves on the real
line with the velocity v given by mv2
2
= E. For E = 0, the particle rests.
(ii) Potential well: U0 < 0 (Fig. 8.2).
• For given energy E > 0, the particle moves with piecewise constant velocity
on the real line.
2 Explicitly, this means that
R
R mx(t) ¨ϕ(t)dt = −
R
R U ′(x(t))ϕ(t)dt for all smooth
test functions ϕ : R →R with compact support.

(8.4)
If the particle hits one of the boundary points x = ±r, then it will be
reﬂected and it changes the direction of motion.
• For E = U0, the particle rests on the interval [−r, r].
(iii) Potential barrier: U0 > 0 (Fig. 8.8 on page 728).
• For given energy E > U0, the particle moves with piecewise constant velocity
on the real line.
• For given energy E ∈]0, U0[, the particle moves either on the interval ] −
∞, −r] or on [r, ∞[. If the particle hits one of the boundary points x = −r
or x = r, then it is reﬂected.
Motion of a quantum particle. The quantum motion with respect to the
potential U from (8.3) will be explicitly computed in the next section. Roughly
speaking, there appear the following quantum modiﬁcations which are crucial from
the physical point of view.
• In the case of the potential well, there exists only a ﬁnite number of bound-state
energies. The corresponding wave functions are not concentrated on the interval
[−r, r]. However, they are decaying exponentially as x →−∞and x →+∞(Fig.
8.3).
• In the case of the potential barrier, the quantum particle is able to pass through
the interval [−r, r]. This means that quantum particles are able to reach regions
which are forbidden by classical mechanics. This quantum eﬀect is called tun-
nelling. For example, the radioactive decay of molecules is based on tunnelling
(Fig. 8.9 on page 728).

8.2 The Stationary Schr¨odinger Equation
The motion of a quantum particle of mass m on the real line is governed by the
Schr¨odinger equation
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t) + U(x)ψ(x, t),
x, t ∈R.
(8.5)
Choosing the real number E and setting
ψ(x, t) = e−iEt/ℏϕ(x),
(8.6)
we get the stationary Schr¨odinger equation
−ℏ2
2mϕxx(x, t) + U(x)ϕ(x) = Eϕ(x),
x ∈R.
(8.7)
If ϕ is a smooth solution of (8.7), then the function ψ from (8.6) satisﬁes the
equation (8.5) and describes a quantum state of energy E. Furthermore, we have
the conservation law
ϱt(x, t) + Jx(x, t) = 0
for all
x, t ∈R
(8.8)
with the particle number density ϱ := |ψ|2 and the particle current density3
J := ℜ

ϱ(x) = |ϕ(x)|2,
J(x) = ℜ

By (8.8), J′(x) = 0 for all x ∈R. This implies the conservation of the particle
current density:
J(x) = const
for all
x ∈R.
(8.10)
Let us formulate a second important conservation law. If ϕ1 and ϕ2 are smooth solu-
tions of (8.7), then a simple computation shows that the derivative of the Wronskian

8.3 One-Dimensional Quantum Motion in a Square-Well
Potential
We are going to show that the motion of a quantum particle on the real line, under
the action of a square-well potential, can be explicitly computed (Fig. 8.4). Our
investigations serve as a prototype for typical phenomena arising in elementary
particle physics. This concerns the following:
• the appearance of both bound states and unbound states (scattering states),
• scattering states are described by eigenfunctions of the energy operator which are
not normalizable (i.e., generalized eigenfunctions in the Hilbert space setting),
• the physical and mathematical importance of the S-matrix,
• conservation of probability and the unitarity of the S-matrix,
• the relation between bound-state energies and singularities of the S-matrix,
• the Fourier–Stieltjes transform with respect to (normalized and non-normali-
zable) eigenfunctions of the energy operator,
• wave packets and wave operators,
• the dynamical meaning of the S-matrix and the relation to wave operators,
• the duality between partial diﬀerential equations (the Schr¨odinger equation) and
integral equations (the Lippmann–Schwinger equation),
• the method of the Green’s function in scattering theory (the Lippmann–Schwinger
equation),
• the energetic Riemann surface and the existence of unstable particles (resonances
and the Breit–Wigner formula).
To begin with, let us switch oﬀthe potential. That is, we want to study the free
motion.

8.3.2 Scattering States and the S-Matrix
Square-well potential. As a typical case, let us now choose the square-well
potential U : R →R from (8.3) with U0 < 0 (Fig. 8.4 on page 705). We want to
solve explicitly the stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.7) with respect to U.
The scattering function ϕk. Fix the parameter k > 0. By deﬁnition, the
scattering function ϕk has the form
ϕk(x) :=

8. Quantum Particles on the Real Line
We have to match the complex coeﬃcients ϱ←, A, B, τ→such that
ϕk ∈C1(R),
that is, we get a continuous and continuously diﬀerentiable function ϕk on the
real line. We will show below that the coeﬃcients can be uniquely determined in
such a way that we obtain a continuously diﬀerentiable solution (in the sense of
distributions) of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.7) with energy E. From the
physical point of view, the scattering function ϕk describes the following situation:
• The function x 	→eikx on ] −∞, −r[ represents an incoming stream of particles
of particle momentum p = k, particle energy E = k2/2, and particle current
density
Jin = k.
The particles move from left to right.
• Reﬂection. The function x 	→ϱ←(k)e−ikx on ] −∞, −r[ represents a particle
stream which is reﬂected at the point x = −r. The reﬂected particles have the
momentum p = −k and the energy E = k2/2. The current density is given by
Jreﬂ= −|ϱ←(k)|2Jin.
The reﬂected particles move from x = −r to x = −∞.
• Transmission. The function x 	→τ→(k)eikx on ]r, ∞[ represents the transmitted
particle stream. These particles have the momentum p = k and the corresponding
energy E = k2
2 . The particle current density is given by
Jtrans = |τ→(k)|2Jin.
The transmitted particles move from x = −r to x = +∞.
Naturally enough, the complex number ϱ←(k) is called the reﬂection amplitude,
and τ→(k) is called the transmission amplitude.
Using ℜ(z −z†) = 0, a simple computation shows that the scattering function
ϕk corresponds to the particle current density Jin + Jreﬂon ] −∞, −r[ and the
particle current density Jtrans on ]r, ∞[. Conservation of particle current density
tells us that we have Jin + Jreﬂ= Jtrans. Hence
|ϱ←(k)|2 + |τ→(k)|2 = 1
for all
k > 0.
(8.14)
For an incoming particle of momentum k, note that
• |ϱ←(k)|2 is the probability for reﬂection at the point x = −r where the potential
well starts, and
• |τ→(k)|2 is the probability for transmission at the point x = −r.
Naturally enough, the sum of the two probabilities is equal to 1 by (8.14). We
will show below that the crucial relation (8.14) between reﬂection probability and
transmission probability is closely connected with the unitarity of the S-matrix.
The scattering function ϕ−k. Let us now reverse the direction of scattering.
This scattering process from right to left is described by the scattering function
ϕ−k of the form
ϕ−k(x) :=

e−ikx + ϱ→(k)eikx

if
x < −r.

8.3 One-Dimensional Quantum Motion in a Square-Well potential
707
Because of the symmetry of the potential well U, we have ϕ−k(x) = ϕk(−x) for all
points x ∈R and all wave numbers k > 0.
Proposition 8.1 Let k > 0. For the reﬂection and transmission amplitude of the
scattering function ϕk with respect to the potential well U from Fig. 8.4 on page
705, we get
ϱ←(k) =

Here, E = k2

This yields the reﬂection probability |ϱ←(k)|2 = 1 −|τ→(k)|2.
For the scattering function ϕ−k, we obtain
ϱ→(k) = ϱ←(k),
τ←(k) = τ→(k).
(8.16)
This follows from the symmetry of the potential well U.
Proof. Consider the scattering function ϕk. We have to determine the coeﬃcients
ϱ←, A, B, τ→along with K. To this end, let us insert the ansatz for ϕk into the
stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.7).
Considering the intervals ] −∞, −r[ and ]r, ∞[, we get E = k2
2 . On the interval
[−r, r], we obtain
E = K2
2
+ U0.
Hence K =
p
2(E −U0). The function ϕk is continuous at the points x = −r and
x = r iﬀ
e−ikr + ϱ←eikr = Ae−iKr + BeiKr,
AeiKr + Be−iKr = τ→eikr.
The derivative of ϕk is continuous at the points x = −r and x = r iﬀ
k(e−ikr −ϱ←eikr) = K(Ae−iKr −BeiKr),
K(AeiKr −Be−iKr) = τ→keikr.
To simplify notation, we set R := ϱ←e2ikr, D := τ→, A := Aei(k−K)r, as well as
B := Bei(k+K)r. Then
1 + R = A + B,
k(1 −R) = K(A −B),
De2ikr = Ae2iKr + Be−2iKr,
kDe2ikr = K(Ae2iKr −Be−2iKr).
Hence

The scattering matrix (S-matrix). Fix the parameter k > 0 called wave
number. The scattering process is characterized by the four transition amplitudes
• τ←(k), ϱ→(k) (scattering from right to left),
• ϱ←(k), τ→(k) (scattering from left to right).
Deﬁne the matrix
ˆS(k) :=
 
τ←(k) ϱ→(k)
ϱ←(k) τ→(k)
!
.
(8.17)
This is called the S-matrix with respect to the wave number k. We will show
below that the matrix ˆS(k) is unitary because of the conservation of the particle
number. The crucial relation between the S-matrix and the quantum dynamics will
be discussed in Sec. 8.3.9 on page 722.
Unitarity of the S-matrix. Let us prove that
For each wave number k > 0, the S-matrix ˆS(k) is unitary.
We have to show that ˆS(k) ˆS(k)† = I (see Problem 9.5). Explicitly,
 
τ←(k) ϱ→(k)
ϱ←(k) τ→(k)
!  
τ←(k)† ϱ←(k)†
ϱ→(k)† τ→(k)†
!
=
 
1 0
0 1
!
.
In fact, by (8.14), |ϱ←(k)|2 + |τ→(k)|2 = 1 (conservation of the particle number
current). Because of (8.16), it remains to show that
ϱ←(k)τ←(k)† + τ→(k)ϱ→(k)† = 0.
(8.18)
To this end, note that the scattering functions ϕk and ϕ−k are solutions of the
stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.7). Since E and U(x) are real, the conjugate
complex scattering functions ϕ†
±k are also solutions of (8.7). Therefore, the Wron-
skian
˛˛˛˛˛
ϕk(x)
ϕ−k(x)†
d
dxϕk(x)
d
dxϕ−k(x)†
˛˛˛˛˛
is constant on the real line. Considering the Wronskian at the two points x = −r
and x = r, we obtain (8.18), after an elementary computation.
2
The transfer matrix. Let us consider a solution ϕ of the stationary Schr¨o-
dinger equation (8.7) on page 703 which has the following form:

8.3 One-Dimensional Quantum Motion in a Square-Well potential

ϕ(x) =

A−eikx + B−e−ikx
if
x < −r,
AeiKx + Be−iKx
if
−r ≤x ≤r,
A+eikx + B+e−ikx
if
x > r.
(8.19)
We are looking for a function ϕ ∈C1(R). The function ϕ is continuous at the points
x = −r and x = r iﬀ
A−e−ikr + B−eikr = Ae−iKr + BeiKr,
AeiKr + Be−iKr = A+eikr + B+e−ikr.
The derivative ϕ′ is continuous at the points x = −r and x = r iﬀ
k(A−e−ikr −B−eikr) = K(Ae−iKr −BeiKr),
K(AeiKr −Be−iKr) = k(A+eikr −B+e−ikr).
This is a linear system for the complex coeﬃcients A±, B±.
Proposition 8.2 Let k > 0. For given complex numbers A+ and B+, the coeﬃ-
cients A−and B−are uniquely determined. Explicitly,
 
A−
B−
!
=
 
α(k) β(k)
β(k)† α(k)†
!
=
 
A+
B+
!
(8.20)
where
α(k) : =
1
τ→(k),
β(k) := −ϱ→(k)
τ→(k) .
(8.21)
For the square-well potential U from Fig. 8.4 on page 705, the transition ampli-
tude τ→(k) and the reﬂection amplitude ϱ→(k) are given by Prop. 8.1. The complex
(2 × 2)-matrix from (8.20) is called the transfer matrix of the potential well U.
Proof. We start with the ansatz
 
A−
B−
!
=
 
α(k) β(k)
γ(k) δ(k)
!
=
 
A+
B+
!
.
(8.22)
In particular, for the scattering function ϕk introduced in (8.13) on page 705, we
obtain
A−= 1, B−= ϱ←(k)
and
A+ = τ→(k), B+ = 0.
Hence
 
1
ϱ←(k)
!
=
 
α(k) β(k)
γ(k) δ(k)

=
 
τ→(k)

Similarly, the scattering function ϕ−k from (8.15) on page 706 tells us that
 
0
τ←(k)
!
=
 
α(k) β(k)
γ(k) δ(k)
!
=
 
ϱ→(k)

.
This implies 1 = ατ→and 0 = αϱ→+β. Passing to the conjugate complex equation
of (8.19), we have to replace A−, B−by B†
−, A†
−, respectively, and so on. This
implies

Comparing this with the ﬁrst line of (8.22), we get γ(k) = β(k)†, and δ(k) = α(k)†.

The transfer matrix plays a crucial role for the approximative computation of
quantum scattering processes on the computer. This can be found in R. Gilmore,
Elementary Quantum Mechanics in One Dimension, John Hopkins University Press,
Baltimore, Maryland, 2004. The idea is to approximate general potentials by step
functions and to compute the transfer matrix for each step.
8.3.3 Bound States
Consider again the square-well potential U from Fig. 8.4 on page 705. A solution ϕ
of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.7) on page 703 represents a bound state
iﬀ
Z
R
|ϕ(x)|2dx = 1.
(8.24)
For the energy E of the quantum particle, we have to distinguish the following three
cases.
• Case 1: E > 0. Since U = 0 on the interval ] −∞, −r[, the general solution of
equation (8.7) on the interval ] −∞, −r[ has the form
A−eikx + B−e−ikx
(8.25)
with complex coeﬃcients A−, B−and E = k2
2 .
• Case 2: E = 0. The general solution of equation (8.7) on ] −∞, −r[ is given by
A−+ B−x.
Thus, bound states are impossible in cases 1 and 2.
• Case 3: U0 ≤E < 0. Let κ > 0. The general solution of (8.7) on ] −∞, −r[ reads
as
A−e−κx + B−eκx
(8.26)
where E = −κ2
2 . If this represents a bound state on the interval ] −∞, −r[, then
A−= 0. That is, the term A−e−κx (with the exponential growth as x →−∞)
vanishes.
Note that the solution (8.26) is obtained from (8.25) by choosing the imaginary
wave number k := iκ.
The bound-state energies. In order to compute all of the bound states ϕ,
let us start with the ansatz

B−eκx

x < −r,
AeiKx + Be−iKx
if

(8.27)
Here, we choose κ :=
√
−2E and K :=
p
2(E −U0).

8.3 One-Dimensional Quantum Motion in a Square-Well potential
711
Proposition 8.3 (i) There exists precisely a ﬁnite number of bound-state energies
E1, . . . En with n = 1, 2, . . . Here,
U0 < E1 < E2 < . . . < En < 0.
All of the energy eigenvalues E1, . . . , En are simple. The bound states ϕ are C1(R)-
functions. They are either even or odd functions with respect to the variable x.
(ii) The even bound states ϕ are given by
ϕ(x) =
8

:
eκx
if
x < −r,
A cos Kx
if
−r ≤x ≤r,
e−κx
if
x > r,
(8.28)
up to a multiplicative constant. The corresponding energy E satisﬁes the transcen-
dental equation
tan Kr = κ
K .
There exists at least one even bound state. The bound state of least energy (i.e., the
ground state) is always even.
(iii) The odd bound states ϕ are given by
ϕ(x) =
8

<

:
eκx
if
x < −r,
B sin Kx
if
−r ≤x ≤r,
−e−κx
if
x > r,
(8.29)
up to a multiplicative constant. The energy E satisﬁes the transcendental equation
cot Kr = −κ
K .
Proof. (I) Simplicity of the bound-state eigenfunctions. Let ϕ1, ϕ2 ∈C1(R). Sup-
pose that ϕ1 and ϕ2 are bound-state solutions of the stationary Schr¨odinger equa-
tion (8.7) for ﬁxed energy E < 0. Consider the interval ] −∞, −r[. By (8.27), there
exists a complex number μ such that
ϕ1(x) = μϕ2(x)
for all
x ∈] −∞, −r[.
Hence ϕ′
1(x) = μϕ′
2(x) for all x ∈] −∞, −r[. By continuity,
ϕ1(−r) = μϕ2(−r),
ϕ′
1(−r) = μϕ′
2(−r).
Solving the Schr¨odinger equation (8.7) on the interval [−r, r] for given initial values
ϕj(−r), ϕ′
j(−r), we get ϕ1(x) = μϕ2(x) for all x ∈[−r, r]. The same argument
shows that ϕ1 = μϕ2 on R.
(II) Symmetry of the bound-state eigenfunctions. Choose the function ϕ1 as in
(I). Deﬁne the reﬂection operator
Rϕ1(x) := ϕ1(−x)
for all
x ∈R.
Since U(−x) = U(x) for all x ∈R, the function Rϕ1 is also a solution of (8.7).
Hence Rϕ1 = μϕ1 for some complex number μ. Therefore,
ϕ1 = R2ϕ1 = R(Rϕ1) = μ2ϕ1.
If ϕ1 ̸= 0, then μ2 = 1. This implies either μ = 1 or μ = −1.

Fig. 8.5. Computation of bound-state energies
(III) Computation of the even bound-state eigenfunctions. Use the ansatz for
the function ϕ from (8.27). Suppose that the function ϕ is even. Hence A = B.
This yields (8.28). Then ϕ and ϕ′ are continuous at the point x = r iﬀ
A cos Kr = e−κr,
AK sin Kr = κe−κr.
Hence tan Kr = κ/K. This is the claim (ii). Analogously, we get (iii).
2
The equation tan Kr =
κ
K with κ = √−2E and K =
p
2(E −U0) can be solved
graphically. To this end, setting x := Kr we get the equation
tan x =
p

,
0 < x < ξ.
Here, ξ := r
p
2|U0|. The solutions x of this equation are the intersection points
between the two curves plotted in Fig. 8.5. There exists at least one intersection
point, and the number of intersection points is ﬁnite. For the intersection point x,
the corresponding bound-state energy is given by
E = U0 + K2
2
= U0
„
1 −x2
ξ2
«
.
The corresponding state function ϕ is even. It can be shown that the number of
intersection points in Fig. 8.5 increases if the parameter ξ increases. In particular,
if the width 2r or the depth |U0| of the potential well goes to inﬁnity (i.e., ξ →∞),
then the number of bound-state energies goes to inﬁnity as well.
Similarly, we can treat the equation cot Kr = −κ
K which yields the bound-state
energies for odd state functions ϕ. It turns out that the ground state of energy E1
is always even with Kr ∈[0, π
2 ]. The ﬁrst excited state of energy E2 is always odd
with Kr ∈[ π
2 , π].
8.3.4 Bound-State Energies and the Singularities of the S-Matrix
We now want to compute the bound-state energies by using analyticity properties
of the S-matrix. Set
k := iκ
with κ > 0. Consider the function ϕ from (8.27) with B−= 1. Since Prop. 8.2 on
page 709 remains valid by using analytic continuation, we obtain
 
0

=
 
α(iκ) β(iκ)
γ(iκ) δ(iκ)
!

!
.
(8.30)
For a bound state ϕ, we have A+ ̸= 0. Therefore, it follows from (8.30) that ϕ is a
bound state iﬀα(iκ) = 0. Since τ→= 1/α, we get the following.

8.3 One-Dimensional Quantum Motion in a Square-Well potential
713
Proposition 8.4 There exists a bound state for the energy Eb < 0 iﬀthe function
κ 	→τ→(iκ) has a pole at the point κ = √−2Eb.
Recall from (8.16) and (8.17) that the S-matrix is given by
ˆS(iκ) :=
 
τ→(iκ) ϱ→(iκ)
ϱ→(iκ) τ→(iκ)
!
.
Thus, Proposition 8.4 tells us the crucial fact that the energies of the bound states
are related to the singularities of the S-matrix. Explicitly, by Prop. 8.1 on page
707,
τ→(iκ) =

„ κ

sin 2Kr = 0
(8.32)
for determing the bound-state energy E. Using the well-known addition theorem
cot 2x = 1
2(cot x −tan x), equation (8.32) is equivalent to
tan Kr −cot Kr = κ
K −K
κ .
This is satisﬁed iﬀ4
tan Kr = κ
K
or
cot Kr = −κ
K .
By Prop. 8.3 on page 711, these two equations determine precisely the bound-state
energies.
8.3.5 The Energetic Riemann Surface, Resonances, and the
Breit–Wigner Formula
Again let us consider the motion of a homogeneous stream of quantum particles
on the real line from left to right under the action of the square-well potential U
pictured in Fig. 8.4 on page 705. We are given the particle energy E > 0. According
to Prop. 8.1 on page 707, the transmission probability is given by
|τ→(k)|2 =

where E =

and K =

2(E + |U0|). This yields the reﬂection probability
|ϱ←(k)|2 = 1 −|τ→(k)|2.
4 Observe that an inspection of the graph of the function f(x) := x−1
x tells us that
for given ξ > 0, the equation f(x) = f(ξ) has precisely two solutions. Explicitly,
the solutions are x = ξ and x = −1

with ER = k2
2 . Consequently, the reﬂection probability is equal to zero,
|ϱ→(k)|2 = 0.
Explicitly, we have |τ→(k)|2 = 1 iﬀsin2 2Kr = 0. Hence 2Kr = nπ where n is a

The energetic Riemann surface. Transmission amplitudes depend on the
wave number k =
√
2E. In order to allow complex parameters k via analytic con-
tinuation, we have to study the function E 	→
√
E on its Riemann surface (Fig.
8.6). Explicitly, we consider the ﬁrst sheet
Σ1 := {E ∈C : E = |E| · eiα, 0 ≤α < 2π}
and the second sheet
Σ2 := {E ∈C : E = |E| · eiβ, 2π ≤β < 4π}.
Observe that the arguments α and β of E are diﬀerent on the ﬁrst and second
sheet. Intuitively, we cut two exemplars of the complex plane along the positive
real axis, and we glue together the two sheets in such a way that the set V pictured
in Fig. 8.6 represents a neighborhood of the point ER on the Riemann surface. To
illustrate this, deﬁne
E(t) := ϱeit,
0 ≤t ≤4π, ϱ > 0.
Consider this as a motion E = E(t) on the two sheets Σ1 and Σ2. Here, we move
counterclockwise along the circle of radius ϱ around the origin. More precisely,
• we start at the point E(0) = ϱ on the ﬁrst sheet at time t = 0;
• we pass through the point E(π) = −ϱ on the ﬁrst sheet at time t = π;
• we then arrive at the point E(2π) = ϱ on the second sheet at time t = 2π,
• and we ﬁnish the trip at the point E(4π) = ϱ on the ﬁrst sheet at time t = 4π.

We now deﬁne

E ∈Σ1,

if
E ∈Σ2.
Similarly,

E. In particular, this deﬁnition is chosen in such a way that
the function E 	→
√
E is continuous on the Riemann surface. Note that the values
of
√
E on the two sheets diﬀer by the sign. For example, if we consider the point
E = 1 on the ﬁrst (resp. second) sheet, then
√
E = 1 (resp.

by analytic continuation, this formula makes sense for all complex numbers E on
the Riemann surface of the function E 	→

E. The singularities of the function
E 	→τ→(

2E) encode important properties of the quantum particle on the real
line.
(i) The transmission amplitude E 	→τ→(

2E) has poles at the points
E1 < E2 < . . . < En < 0
on the negative real axis of the ﬁrst sheet of the energetic Riemann surface.
These poles are the energies of bound states of the particle.
(ii) The transmission probability function E 	→|τ→(

which lie on the second sheet of the energetic Riemann surface, by the construc-
tion of the open neighborhood V in Fig. 8.6. In terms of elementary particle
physics, this serves as a model for an unstable particle of energy ERn and mean
lifetime Γn. For the transmission probability, we get

positive real axis of the ﬁrst sheet Σ1 of the energetic Riemann surface, and choose
an open neighborhood V of the point ER on the energetic Riemann surface as
pictured in Fig. 8.6 on page 714.
Now to the point. The function E 	→

E is holomorphic on the open set V.
Consequently, the function E 	→τ→(

The relation between energy operators, non-real energy eigenvalues, and reso-
nances (unstable particles) is studied in
P. Hislop and I. Sigal, Introduction to Spectral Theory: with Applications
to Schr¨odinger Operators, Springer, New York, 1996.
This monograph uses the functional-analytic approach to operators which are not
self-adjoint. We also refer to
S. Gustafson and I. Sigal, Mathematical Concepts of Quantum Mechanics,
Springer, Berlin, 2003.
Our discussion above shows that scattering processes are closely related to analyt-
icity properties of the S-matrix elements with respect to the wave number. There
exist far-reaching generalizations in the context of analytic S-matrix theory. We
recommend the monograph by
A. Barut, The Theory of the Scattering Matrix, MacMillan, New York,
1967.
Summary. Let us summarize the results on the motion of a quantum particle
on the real line under the action of the square-well potential U introduced in (8.3)
on page 701 with U0 < 0. The stationary Schr¨odinger equation
−1
2ϕxx(x) + U(x)ϕ(x) = Eϕ(x),
x ∈R
(8.37)
has the following solutions.
(i) Bound states. There exist the eigenfunctions χj, j = 1, . . . , n, with the corre-
sponding energies Ej, j = 1, . . . n, where
U0 < E1 < . . . < En < 0.
The eigenvalues are simple. The eigenfunctions χ1, . . . , χn form an orthonormal
system in the Hilbert space L2(R). Explicitly,
⟨χj|χk⟩2 = δjk,
j, k = 1, . . . , n.
Here, we use the inner product
⟨ϕ|χ⟩2 :=
Z
R
ϕ(x)†χ(x)dx
(8.38)
for all functions ϕ, χ ∈L2(R). In what follows, we will also use the symbol
⟨ϕ|χ⟩2 in the case where at least one of the functions ϕ, χ does not lie in the
Hilbert space L2(R), but only the integral
R
R ϕ(x)†χ(x)dx exists. For example,
if ϕ(x) := 1 and χ(x) := e−x2/2 for all x ∈R, then

8. Quantum Particles on the Real Line
(ii) Scattering eigenfunctions. For each wave number k > 0, there exist the two
scattering eigenfunctions ϕk and ϕ−k with the energy E = k2
2 . The eigenfunc-
tions ϕ±k do not lie in the Hilbert space L2(R). In fact, we have
⟨ϕ±k|ϕ±k⟩2 =
Z
R
|ϕ±k(x)|2dx = ∞
for all
k > 0.
The explicit form of the eigenfunctions ϕ±k can be found in Prop. 8.1 on page
707. The scattering eigenfunctions ϕ±k have the following asymptotic behavior
ϕ±k(x) ≃τ→(k) e±ikx
as x →±∞.
8.3.6 The Jost Functions
Fix the wave number k > 0 and choose the square-well potential U from (8.3) on
page 701 with U0 ≤0. Consider the stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.37) on page
717 with the energy
E := k2
2 .
Observe that we have the following general solution principle.
(P) If two C1(R)-solutions ϕ and χ of equation (8.37) (in the sense of
distributions) coincide on some open interval, then they coincide on the
real line.
This follows from the unique solvability of the initial-value problem for (8.37). Since
the square-well potential U vanishes outside the interval [−r, r], the equation (8.37)
has the special solutions
Jk(x) := eikx
for all
x > r
and
J−k(x) := e−ikx
for all
x < −r.
These functions can be uniquely extended to solutions of the stationary Schr¨odinger
equation (8.37) on the real line. Explicitly,
J±k(x) = ϕ±k(x)
τ→(k)
for all
x ∈R.
The functions Jk and J−k are called the Jost functions.5
Proposition 8.5 Let k > 0. For all x ∈R, we have
 
J−k(x)
J−k(x)†
!
=
 
a(k) b(k)
b(k)† a(k)†
!  
Jk(x)†
Jk(x)
!
where
a(k) :=
1
τ→(k),
b(k) := ϱ→(k)
τ→(k) .
5 If the potential vanishes identically, U ≡0, then we get the free Jost functions
J±k(x) = e±ikx for all x ∈R.

8.3 One-Dimensional Quantum Motion in a Square-Well potential
719
Therefore, if we know the Jost functions, then we also know the coeﬃcients
a(k), b(k) which imply the reﬂection and transmission amplitudes. This tells us
that
The Jost functions know all about the S-matrix.
Proof. Let x > r. Then Jk(x) = eikx. By (8.15) on page 706, we get
J−k(x) = ϕ−k(x)
τ→(k) = e−ikx + ϱ→(k)eikx
τ→(k)
.
Hence a(k) = 1/τ→(k) and b(k) = ϱ→(k)/τ→(k).

8.3.7 The Fourier–Stieltjes Transformation
The Fourier transformation and its generalizations lie at the heart of math-
ematics.
Folklore
Let us again consider the square-well potential U from (8.3) on page 701 with
U0 < 0. Let us use the notation summarized on page 717. The key formula reads as
ϕ(x) =

c(k) :=

2π
Z ∞

where j = 1, . . . , n and k ∈R \ {0}. Moreover, in the special case where k = 0, we
set ϕ0(x) := 0 for all x ∈R, and c(0) := 0. Let us add the Parseval equation6

(8.40)
Here, cj, c(k) and dj, d(k) are the Fourier–Stieltjes coeﬃcients of the functions ϕ and
χ, respectively. We now use the space S(R) of smooth, rapidly decreasing functions
ϕ : R →C.7
Theorem 8.6 For all functions ϕ, χ ∈S(R), we have the Fourier–Stieltjes expan-
sion formula (8.39) and the Parseval equation (8.40).
For the proof, we refer to Berezin and Shubin (1991), p. 126. This theorem is
the prototype of general expansion theorems in mathematics which date back to
Hermann Weyl’s 1908 dissertation in G¨ottingen on singular integral operators and
his 1910 habilitation thesis in G¨ottingen on singular diﬀerential operators.8 Weyl’s
6 Parseval des Ch´enes (1755–1836), Fourier (1768–1830), Stieltjes (1856–1894).

fundamental paper:

second order and Heisenberg’s theory of S-matrices. Amer. J. Math. 71 (1949),

8. Quantum Particles on the Real Line
dissertation was supervised by Hilbert. If the potential vanishes identically, U ≡0,
then the eigenfunctions χj drop out and we have ϕk(x) = eikx for all x ∈R. In this
special case, equation (8.39) passes over to the classical Fourier transform. Let us
now discuss the relation to both the theory of unitary operators and the theory of
generalized eigenfunctions in Hilbert spaces.
Unitary extension. Motivated by the Fourier–Stieljes expansion formula
(8.39), we set
Uϕ := (c1, . . . , cn; c(k))k∈R.
This deﬁnes a linear operator U : S(R) →Y from the space S(R) of rapidly
decreasing test functions into the product Hilbert space
Y := Cn × L2(R)
equipped with the inner product

j=1

c(k)†d(k)dk.
The Parseval equation (8.40) tells us that
⟨Uϕ|Uχ⟩Y = ⟨ϕ|χ⟩2
for all
ϕ, χ ∈S(R).
Since the set S(R) is dense in the Hilbert space L2(R), the operator U can be
uniquely extended to a unitary operator9
U : L2(R) →Y.
(8.41)
This operator is called the Fourier–Stieltjes transform generated by the stationary
Schr¨odinger equation (8.37).
8.3.8 Generalized Eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian
Motivated by the stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.37), we introduce the Hamil-
tonian
Hϕ := −1
2
d2ϕ
dx2 + Uϕ
for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R). Moreover, for any test function ϕ ∈S(R), we deﬁne
the functionals
• Fj(ϕ) := ⟨χj|ϕ⟩2 for j = 1, . . . , n, and
• Gk(ϕ) :=
1
√
2π ⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩2 for all k ∈R. 10
In terms of the Fourier–Stieltjes transformation, this means that we assign the
Fourier–Stieltjes coeﬃcients to the test function ϕ. Brieﬂy,
Fj(ϕ) = cj,
Gk(ϕ) = c(k),
j = 1, . . . , n, k ∈R.
This way, we obtain linear, sequentially continuous functionals
9 See Zeidler (1995a), Sec. 3.6, quoted on page 1049.
10 Note that the integral ⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩2 =
R
R ϕk(x)†ϕ(x)dx exists for all ϕ ∈S(R) because
of the boundedness of the functions ϕk.

8.3 One-Dimensional Quantum Motion in a Square-Well potential
721
Fj, Gk : S(R) →C.
In other words, Fj and Gk are tempered distributions11 which lie in the space S′(R),
and we have
Fj(Hϕ) = EjFj(ϕ),
Gk(Hϕ) = E(k)Gk(ϕ)
(8.42)
for all ϕ ∈S(R) with the energies Ej and E(k) := k2
2 . Here, j = 1, . . . , n and k ∈R.
In fact, since Ej is real, we get
⟨χj|Hϕ⟩2 = ⟨Hχj|ϕ⟩2 = Ej⟨χj|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).
Furthermore, note that Hϕk = E(k)ϕk for all k ∈R. Thus, for all ϕ ∈S(R),
integration by parts yields
⟨ϕk|Hϕ⟩2 = ⟨Hϕk|ϕ⟩2 = E(k)⟨ϕk|ϕ⟩2.
Note that the boundary terms of the integration-by-parts formula vanish, since the
function ϕ decreases rapidly at ±∞.
Theorem 8.7 The family {F1, . . . , Fn, Gk}k∈R represents a complete orthonormal
system of generalized eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian H.
Explicitly, this means that the following three conditions are satisﬁed.
(i) Generalized eigenfunctions. In terms of the theory of tempered distributions,
we have
Hχj = Ejχj,
HGk = E(k)Gk,
j = 1, . . . , n, k ∈R.
(ii) Completeness. For any given ϕ ∈S(R), it follows from
Fj(ϕ) = Gk(ϕ) = 0
for all indices j = 1, . . . , n, k ∈R that ϕ = 0.
(iii) Orthonormality. The operator U : S(R) →Y given by
U(ϕ) := (F1(ϕ), . . . , Fn(ϕ); Gk(ϕ))k∈R
can be uniquely extended to a unitary operator U : L2(R) →Y.
Proof. Ad (i). This is a reformulation of (8.42).

8.3.9 Quantum Dynamics and the Scattering Operator
Wave operators describe the motion of wave packets; the scattering oper-
ator is closely related to the S-matrix.
Folklore
Again let U denote the square-well potential from (8.3) with U0 < 0 (see Fig. 8.4
on page 705). The preceding results admit the following physical interpretation.
Consider again the Hamiltonian H given by
(Hϕ)(x) :=
„
−1
2
d2
dx2 + U(x)
«
ϕ(x),
x ∈R
for all ϕ ∈S(R). The operator H : S(R) →L2(R) is an essentially self-adjoint
operator on the Hilbert space L2(R), which can be extended to the self-adjoint
operator
H : D(H) →L2(R)
on the Hilbert space L2(R). By deﬁnition, the free Hamiltonian Hfree is obtained
from H by switching oﬀthe potential, U ≡0.
(i) Dynamics: For each given initial state ψ0 ∈L2(R), the motion of the quantum
particle is given by
ψ(t) = e−iHtψ0
for all
t ∈R.
(8.43)
(ii) Bound states. We have the eigensolutions
Hχj = Ejχj,
j = 1, . . . , n
with U0 < E1 < . . . < En < 0. The energy eigenstates χ1, . . . , χn form an
orthonormal system in L2(R). For given initial state χj with j = 1, . . . , n, the
corresponding dynamics is given by ψj(t) = e−iEjtχj for all t ∈R.
(iii) Scattering states. Let B be the linear hull of the energy eigenstates χ1, . . . , χn.
The elements of B are called bound states. We have the orthogonal decompo-
sition
L2(R) = B ⊕B⊥.
By deﬁnition, ϕ ∈B⊥iﬀ⟨ϕ|χj⟩2 = 0 for all j = 1, . . . , n. The elements
of the orthogonal complement B⊥to the space B of bound states are called
scattering states of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.37). It turns out
that the following holds.
If the initial state ψ0 is a scattering state, then the dynamics (8.43) is
asymptotically free in both the distant future and the remote past.
Explicitly, there exist states ϕout and ϕin in L2(R) such that
lim
t→+∞||e−itHψ0 −e−itHfreeϕout|| = 0
and
lim
t→−∞||e−itHψ0 −e−itHfreeϕin|| = 0.
This justiﬁes the designation ‘scattering states’ for the states in B⊥.

8.3 One-Dimensional Quantum Motion in a Square-Well potential

(iv) Wave operators. Setting
Woutϕout := ψ0,
Winϕin := ψ0,
we get the wave operators Wout, Win : L2(R) →B⊥which are unitary from the
original Hilbert space L2(R) onto the space B⊥of scattering states. In terms
of limits,12
Woutϕout =
lim
t→+∞eitHe−itHfreeϕout.
Similarly, we get Winϕin = limt→−∞eitHe−itHfreeϕin.
(v) The scattering operator S. Set
Sϕin := ϕout.
In other words, the scattering operator connects the initial state of the free
motion in the remote past with the initial state of the free motion in the
distant future. This way, the time-dependent scattering process is reduced to
the investigation of initial states at time t = 0 for free motions. In terms of the
wave operators, the scattering operator is given by
S = W −1
outWin.
(8.44)
This means that WoutS = Win. In other words, the following diagram

L2(R)
(8.45)
is commutative.13 It follows from the unitarity of the wave operators that
The scattering operator S : L2(R) →L2(R) is unitary.
Summarizing, we get the following.
• Suppose that we are given the scattering state ψ0 ∈B⊥at the initial time
t = 0.
• The dynamics ψ(t) = e−itHψ0 of the quantum particle under the action of
the potential U behaves like the free dynamics
ψ−(t) = e−itHfreeϕin
as t →−∞.
Here, ϕin = W −1
in ψ(0).
12 Note that ||e−itHψ0 −e−itHfreeϕout|| is equal to
||e−itH(ψ0 −eitHe−itHfreeϕout)|| = ||ψ0 −eitHe−itHfreeϕout||,
by the unitarity of the operator eitH for all t ∈R. This remains true if we replace
ϕout by ϕin.
13 In order to prove (8.44), note that ϕout = Sϕin is equivalent to
W −1
outψ0 = SW −1
in ψ0
for all
ψ0 ∈B⊥.
Hence W −1
out = SW −1
in . This implies W −1
outWin = S.

8. Quantum Particles on the Real Line
• The dynamics ψ(t) = e−itHψ0 of the quantum particle under the action of
the potential U behaves like the free dynamics
ψ+(t) = e−itHfreeϕout
as t →+∞.
Here, ϕout = Sϕin.
(vi) The relation between wave operators and the motion of wave packets. The
harmonic wave function x 	→eikx does not lie in the Hilbert space L2(R).
In order to improve the situation, the trick is to construct wave packets
which lie in L2(R).
More precisely, by a free wave packet we understand a function of the form
ϕfree(x) :=
Z ∞
−∞
A(k)eikxdk
for all
x ∈R
where the smooth amplitude function A : R →C has compact support. In
terms of physics, this is a superposition of harmonic waves. Since A ∈S(R), the
theory of the Fourier transform tells us that ϕfree ∈S(R). Hence ϕfree ∈L2(R).
Moreover, for each wave number k ∈R, we have
Hfreeeikx = E(k)eikx,
x ∈R
with the energy E(k) = k2
2 .
Now switch on the potential U. For each wave number k ∈R \ {0}, let us pass
to the function ϕk with
Hϕk(x) = E(k)ϕk(x),
x ∈R.
By a wave packet induced by the potential U, we understand a function of the
form
ϕU(x) :=
Z ∞
−∞
A(k)ϕk(x)dk
for all
x ∈R.
That is, we replace the harmonic wave by the solution ϕk of the stationary
Schr¨odinger equation (8.37) on page 717. The proofs of the following statements
can be found in Berezin and Shubin (1991).
It turns out that the wave operator Wout sends the free wave packet ϕfree to
the wave packet ϕU. Explicitly, for all amplitude functions A ∈D(R), we get
Wout
„Z ∞
−∞
A(k)eikxdk
«
=
Z ∞

A(k)ϕk(x)dk.
Similarly, for the wave operator Win, we get
Win
„Z ∞

A(k)e−ikxdk
«
=
Z ∞
−∞
A(k)ϕk(x)†dk.
This yields the scattering operator S = W −1
outWin.
(vii) The relation between the scattering operator S and the S-matrix ˆS. Fix the
wave number k > 0. Recall that the functions ϕk and ϕ−k have the following
asymptotical behavior
ϕk(x) :=
(
eikx + ϱ←(k)e−ikx
if
x < −r,
τ→(k)eikx
if
x > r

and
ϕ−k(x) :=
(
e−ikx + ϱ→(k)eikx
if
x > r,
τ←(k)e−ikx
if
x < −r.
For the unitary scattering operator S : L2(R) →L2(R), set
χ := Sϕ
for all
ϕ ∈S(R).

Finally, let us introduce the global S-matrix ˆS by setting
ˆS := { ˆS(k)}k>0.
(8.47)
Here, ˆS(k) is called the k-component of the global S-matrix with respect to
the wave number k.
The formulas above show that one has to distinguish between the scattering oper-
ator S and the scattering matrix ˆS. However, for historical reasons and by abuse of
language, the two notions ‘scattering operator’ and ‘S-matrix’ are frequently used
in a synonymous manner.

8.3.10 The Feynman Propagator
It is our goal to describe the quantum dynamics in terms of the Fourier–Stieltjes
transformation. Recall that Y := Cn × L2(R). The key formulas read as follows:
• Uϕ := (cj, c(k)) and Uχ := (dj, d(k)) for all ϕ, χ ∈L2(R).
•
ˆH(cj, c(k)) := (Ejcj, E(k)c(k)) on D( ˆH).
• For all times t ∈R and all (cj, c(k)) ∈Y , we have
e−it ˆ
H(cj, c(k)) := (e−itEjcj, e−itE(k)c(k)).
More precisely, (cj, c(k)) stands for (cj, c(k))j=1,...,n,k∈R, and so on. By deﬁnition,
the set D( ˆH) consists of all (cj, c(k)) ∈Y with the property
n
X
j=1
E2
j |cj|2 +
Z ∞
−∞
E(k)2|c(k)|2dk < ∞
where E(k) := k2
2 . We also set D(H) := U −1D( ˆH). Then the following hold true:
(i) The operator ˆH : D( ˆH) →Y is self-adjoint on the Hilbert space Y, and it is the
Fourier–Stieltjes transform of the self-adjoint Hamiltonian H : D(H) →L2(R)
on the Hilbert space L2(R). This means that the following diagram
L2(R)
U

H
 L2(R)

Y

H
 Y
(8.48)
is commutative. In other words, UH = ˆHU on D(H). Equivalenty, we have
H = U −1 ˆHU on D(H).
(ii) For each time t ∈R, the unitary operator e−it ˆ
H : Y →Y is the Fourier–
Stieltjes transform of the unitary operator e−itH : L2(R) →L2(R). Explicitly,
e−itH = U −1e−it ˆ
HU.
The propagator. Set P(t) := e−itH for all t ∈R. The operator P(t) is called
the propagator of the Hamiltonian H at time t. Since the operator H is self-adjoint,
the Stone theorem tells us that the operator
P(t) : L2(R) →L2(R)
is a well-deﬁned unitary operator. For all given functions ϕ, χ ∈S(R) and each
time t ∈R, we have

Using the Heaviside function, deﬁne
P +(t) := θ(t)P(t)
for all
t ∈R
and P −(t) := −θ(−t)P(t).14 This implies the splitting
14 Recall that θ(t) := 1 if t ≥0 and θ(t) := 0 if t < 0. .

propagator at time t.

Here, the functions χj and ϕk are taken from (8.39) on page 719. In physics text-
books, formula (8.50) is formally motivated in the following way. The integral

In turn, this is equal to ⟨ϕ|P(t)χ⟩2.
The kernel strategy of physicists. The mathematical approach to quantum
physics is based on the language of self-adjoint operators. In order to get more
information about the operators, it is useful to pass to the representation of opera-
tors by kernels which depend on space and time. The kernels are closely related to
Green’s functions. In mathematics, the operator approach was introduced by von
Neumann in the late 1920s. In physics, the formal kernel approach was invented by
Dirac in the late 1920s and further developed by Feynman in the early 1940s (rep-
resentation of the kernels by path integrals). In the late 1940s, Laurent Schwartz
proved his kernel theorem which gives the kernel approach of physicists a rigorous
basis (see Vol. I, Sec. 12.2.7). It was shown by Grothendieck in the 1950s that the
kernel approach is closely related to the theory of nuclear spaces.
8.4 Tunnelling of Quantum Particles and Radioactive

Radioactive decay. It was discovered in about 1900 that there exist atoms which
decay. This is the phenomenon of radioactive decay under the action of the weak
force. We distinguish between

(i) α-decay (emission of α-particles consisting of two protons and two neutrons)
and
(ii) β-decay (emission of electrons).
In terms of classical mechanics, the α-particles cannot leave the atom because of a
high potential barrier. However, in contrast to the classical situation, the α-particles
can leave the atom by means of the tunnelling eﬀect in quantum mechanics. Let us
discuss this by considering a one-dimensional model.
Classical motion. We consider the potential barrier
U(x) :=
(
U0
if
−r ≤x ≤r,
0
otherwise
(8.51)
where U0 > 0. For a classical particle of energy E, we have E ≥U(x) for all
positions x of the particle. Let 0 ≤E < U0. Then the particle is able to move on
the interval ]r, ∞[ or on ] −∞, −r[ with the constant velocity v where E = v2
2 . If
the particle reaches the potential barrier at the point x = r or x = −r, then it is
reﬂected (Fig. 8.8).
Motion of a quantum particle. In contrast to the classical motion, a quan-
tum particle is able to pass the potential barrier (Fig. 8.9). This quantum eﬀect is
called tunnelling. Let us study this. For the given energy E of the quantum particle,
let us distinguish the following two cases.
Case 1: E > U0. We set k :=
√
2E and K :=
p
2(E −U0). Moreover, for the
state function, we make the ansatz

This is an analytic continuation of the solution (8.53) of the stationary Schr¨odinger
equation (8.37), and hence it is also a solution of (8.37).
8.5 The Method of the Green’s Function in a Nutshell
The universal method of the Green’s function is based on integration by
parts, which corresponds to the fundamental theorem of calculus due to
Newton and Leibniz in one dimension and to the Gauss integral theorem in
higher dimensions.15 This method allows us the passage from diﬀerential
equations to integral equations.
In particular, the Schr¨odinger diﬀerential equation from the year 1926
passes over to the Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation from the year
1950. In contrast to the Schr¨odinger diﬀerential equation, the Lippmann–
Schwinger integral equation automatically yields the right asymptotic be-
havior of the wave function for scattering processes and allows us to com-
pute approximations, like the Born approximation in lowest order. This
is related to Picard’s method of successive iterations and Banach’s ﬁxed
point theorem.
The two approaches of Feynman and Schwinger to quantum ﬁeld theory
from the 1940s are based on Green’s method combined with the Dirac
delta function. The modern version of Green’s method uses the theory of
distributions created by Laurent Schwartz in the 1940s.16
Folklore
Let us now replace the square-well potential and the potential barrier by a more
general potential U. To simplify the considerations, we assume that the following
hold true.
15 Newton (1743–1727), Leibniz (1746–1716), Gauss (1777–1855), George Green
(1793–1843), Picard (1856–1941), Banach (1892–1945), Dirac (1902–1984), Feyn-
man (1918–1988), Schwinger (1918–1994), Laurent Schwartz (1915–2004).
16 For the theory of distributions, we refer to Chap. 11 of Vol. I.

Fig. 8.10. Potential of a quantum particle on the real line
(A) The function U : R →R is smooth and has compact support, that is, there
exists a number r > 0 such that U(x) = 0 if |x| > r (Fig. 8.10).
The corresponding Schr¨odinger equation reads as
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t) + κU(x)ψ(x, t),
x, t ∈R
(8.55)
where κ ≥0 is called the coupling constant. The time-dependent wave function
ψ = ψ(x, t) describes the motion of a quantum particle on the real line under the
action of the potential U.
8.5.1 The Inhomogeneous Helmholtz Equation
Fix the wave number k > 0, and set E(k) := ℏk2
2m . According to the classical Fourier
method, we make the ansatz
ψ(x, t) := e−iE(k)t/ℏϕ(x),
x, t ∈R.
To simplify notation, we set ℏ:= 1 and m := 1
2 (mass of the particle). This way,
we obtain the stationary Schr¨odinger equation
−d2ϕ(x)
dx2
−k2ϕ(x) = −κU(x)ϕ(x),
x ∈R.
(8.56)
Our goal is to reduce the stationary Schr¨odinger equation to the following inhomo-
geneous Helmholtz equation17
−d2ϕ(x)
dx2
−k2ϕ(x) = f(x),
x ∈R.
(8.57)
Again the parameter k > 0 is ﬁxed. We are given the smooth function
f : R →C
with compact support, that is, f ∈D(R). We are looking for the most general
smooth solution ϕ : R →C of (8.57).
In what follows, we will explain the relation between the formal language
of physicists and the rigorous language of mathematicians.
17 Helmholtz (1821–1894).

8.5 The Method of the Green’s Function in a Nutshell
731
Note that the formal language used by physicists is distinguished by mnemonic
elegance. For a mathematician it is very useful to know both the formal and the
rigorous language.
Our plan. In the next section, we will introduce the retarded fundamental
solution F+ and the retarded Green’s function G+(x, y) = F+(x −y), and we will
use this function in order to solve the Helmholtz equation (8.57).
In Section 8.6, we will use the retarded Green’s function in order to replace
the stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.56) by the following Lippmann–Schwinger
integral equation
ϕ(x) = eikx −κ
Z
R
G+(x, y)U(y)ϕ(y)dy,
x ∈R
(8.58)
for the unknown function ϕ. Setting ϕ = 0 on the right-hand side of (8.58), we get
the zeroth approximation ϕ0(x) := eikx. Replacing ϕ by ϕ0 on the right-hand side
of (8.58), we obtain the ﬁrst approximation
ϕ1(x) := ϕ0(x) −κ
Z
R
G+(x, y)U(y)ϕ0(y)dy
which is called the Born approximation by physicists.18 This is a good approxima-
tion if the coupling constant κ is suﬃciently small.
The solutions of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation (8.56) may possess diﬀer-
ent asymptotics at inﬁnity, x →±∞.
The advantage of the Lippmann–Schwinger equation is that the solutions
of this integral equation (8.58) are solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation
which possess the right asymptotic behavior with respect to a scattering
process from left to right.
This is guaranteed by the appropriate choice of the retarded Green’s function G+.
8.5.2 The Retarded Green’s Function, and the Existence and
Uniqueness Theorem
In order to simplify the notation, let us introduce the Helmholtz operator
L := −d2
dx2 −k2
for ﬁxed k > 0. Thus, the Helmholtz equation (8.57) reads as Lϕ = f.
Retarded fundamental solution. To begin with, let us study the equation
Lϕ = f in the special case where f(x) := δ(x). This means that we want to solve
the special inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation
Lϕ(x) = δ(x),
x ∈R,
(8.59)
in the sense of tempered distributions on the real line. To this end, set
F+(x) := iei|x|k
2k
for all
x ∈R.

(in German).

8. Quantum Particles on the Real Line
The corresponding tempered distribution reads as F+(χ) :=
R
R F+(x)χ(x)dx for
all test functions χ ∈S(R). The function F+ satisﬁes the following asymptotic
condition
lim
x→±∞(F ′
+(x) ∓ikF+(x)) = 0.
This is a special case of the Sommerfeld radiation condition19 to be discussed below
on page 734.
Proposition 8.8 For ﬁxed k > 0, the function F+ is a solution of equation (8.59).
The function F+ is called the retarded fundamental solution of the Helmholtz op-
erator L.
Proof. We have to show that
Z
R
F+(x)Lχ(x)dx = χ(0)
for all
χ ∈S(R).
To this end, we will use integration by parts, that is,

Integration by parts yields Green’s key formula
Z
R\Uη(0)
(F+Lχ −χLF+)dx = (F+χ′ −χF ′

(8.60)
Note that the smooth function χ vanishes outside some bounded interval. Thus,
the additional boundary terms vanish.
(II) The limit η →+0. For the classical derivative of F+ outside the origin, we
get
F ′
+(x) =
(
−1
2eixk
if
x > 0,
1
2e−ixk
if
x < 0.
Consequently, the function F+ has the following three crucial properties:
(i) Solution of the diﬀerential equation outside the origin: LF+(x) = 0 for all
x ∈R \ {0}.
(ii) Continuity: The function F+ : R →C is continuous.
(iii) Jump of the ﬁrst derivative at the origin: F ′
+(−0) −F ′
+(+0) = 1.20
Applying this to the key formula (8.60), we get
Z
R\Uη(0)
F+Lχdx = (F+χ′ −χF ′

Letting η →+0, we obtain

F+Lχdx = χ(0)(F ′

19 Sommerfeld (1868–1951).
20 As usually, we write F(x0 ± 0) := limε→+0 F(x0 ± ε).

8.5 The Method of the Green’s Function in a Nutshell
733
This is the desired relation.
The same argument applies to each test function χ ∈S(R). In fact, the function
χ vanishes rapidly as x →±∞. Thus, applying integration by parts to the large
interval [−K, K], we obtain boundary terms at the points ±K which vanish as
K →+∞.
2
Formal approach to the Helmholtz equation via the Dirac delta func-
tion. We now want to use the fundamental solution F+ in order to construct a
special solution of the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation (8.57). We will use a
general formal method which is always applied by physicists to linear, inhomoge-
neous diﬀerential equations. The idea is to elegantly use the convolution
ϕspecial = F+ ∗f.
Explicitly, we obtain
ϕspecial(x) =
Z
R
F+(x −y)f(y)dy
for all
x ∈R.
(8.61)
In fact, formally applying the relation LF+(x) = δ(x), we get
Lϕspecial(x) =
Z
R
LxF+(x −y)f(y)dy =
Z
R
δ(x −y)f(y)dy = f(x).
That is, the function ϕspecial is a special solution of the Helmholtz equation
Lϕ = f. The general solution of the homogeneous equation Lψ = 0 reads as
ψ(x) := a+eikx + a−e−ikx where a± are arbitrary complex numbers. Consequently,
the general solution of the Helmholtz equation Lϕ = f is given by
ϕ(x) = a+eikx + a−e−ikx + ϕspecial(x).
Rigorous approach. We now want to show how the preceding elegant, but
formal argument can be turned into a rigorous proof. To this end, we have to
carefully compute the operator Lϕ by using the limit from the diﬀerence quotient
to the diﬀerential quotient. The point is that the ﬁrst derivative of F+ jumps at
the origin. Naively, one expects that
Lx
Z
R
F+(x −y)f(y)dy =
Z
R
LxF+(x −y)f(y)dy.
However, observe that this formula is only valid if the derivatives of the function
x 	→F+(x −y) behave regularly (see Problem 9.2). The discontinuities of LF+ are
responsible for the modiﬁed formula
Lx
Z
R
F+(x −y)f(y)dy =
Z
R
LxF+(x −y)f(y)dy + C(x)
with an additional non-vanishing term C(x). Let us deﬁne the retarded Green’s
function G+(x, y) := F+(x −y). Explicitly,
G+(x, y) = ieik|x−y|
2k
for all
x, y ∈R.

8. Quantum Particles on the Real Line
Theorem 8.9 Fix k > 0. We are given the smooth function f : R →C with
compact support. Then the following hold.
(i) General solution: The smooth solutions of the inhomogeneous Helmholtz
equation (8.57) are given by
ϕ(x) = a+eikx + a−e−ikx +
Z
R
G+(x, y)f(y)dy,
x ∈R
(8.62)
with the retarded Green’s function G+ and arbitrary complex numbers a+ and a−.
(ii) Unique solution: If we add the Sommerfeld radiation condition for outgoing
waves
dϕ(x)
dx
= ±ikϕ(x) + o(1),
x →±∞,
then the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation (8.57) has the unique smooth solution
(8.62) with a+ = a−= 0.
Proof. Ad (i). It remains to show that the function
ϕspecial(x) :=
Z ∞
−∞
G+(x, y)f(y)dy,
x ∈R
is a special solution of Lϕ = f.
(I) By the proof of Prop. 8.8, we know that
Z
R
F+(y)Lχ(y)dy = χ(0)
for all
χ ∈D(R).
Replacing the origin x = 0 by the point x ∈R, the same argument tells us that
Z
R
F+(y −x)Lχ(y)dy = χ(x)
for all
χ ∈D(R).
Because of F+(x −y) = F+(y −x) and f ∈D(R), we get
Z
R
F+(x −y)Lf(y)dy = f(x).
This is true for all x ∈R.
(II) Thus, it remains to show that
Lϕspecial(x) =
Z
R
F+(x −y)Lf(y)dy.
To prove this, ﬁx x ∈R.
(III) First let us prove that
ϕ′
special(x) =
Z
R
F+(x −y)f ′(y)dy.
(8.63)
In other words, we have to show that
lim
h→0
ϕspecial(x + h) −ϕspecial(x)
h
=
Z
R
F+(x −y)f ′(y)dy.
To this end, we set

(III-1) Inspection of A. We are given ε > 0. We want to show that there exist
numbers h0 > 0 and η0 > 0 such that
|A| < ε
for all
h ∈] −h0, h0[ and η ∈] −η0, η0[.
(8.64)
This follows from the triangle inequality | |x+h−y|−|x−y| | ≤|h| and the Taylor
expansion
eik|x+h−y| −eik|x−y| = ik(|x + h −y| −|x −y|) + remainder.
Hence
˛˛˛˛
eik|x+h−y| −eik|x−y|
h
˛˛˛˛ ≤k + . . .
The dots denote terms which go to zero if y →x and h →0. Thus, we obtain
|A| ≤2ηk + . . . This implies (8.64).
(III-2) Inspection of B. Since the point x lies outside the domain of integration
R\]x −η, x + η[, we can use the classical rule for diﬀerentiating parameter integrals
(see Problem 9.2). Therefore,
lim
h→0 B =
Z
R\]x−η,x+η[
∂
∂xF+(x −y) f(y)dy.
Since
∂
∂xF+(x −y) = −∂
∂y F+(x −y), integration by parts yields
lim
h→0 B =
Z
R\]x−η,x+η[
F+(x −y) f ′(y)dy + C(η),
where R(η) := F+(−η)f(x −η) −F+(η)f(x + η). Letting η →0 and noting that
limη→+0 R(η) = 0, we get the claim (8.63), up to some term whose modulus is less
than ε. Since the number ε can be chosen arbitrarily small, we obtain the claim
(8.63).
(IV) Repeating the argument from (III), we get
ϕ′′
special(x) =
Z
R
F+(x −y)f ′′(y)dy.
This yields immediately the desired result (II).
Ad (ii). Observe that the function ϕ(x) := eikx (resp. e−ikx) violates the Som-
merfeld radiation condition at x = −∞(resp. x = +∞). However, the argument
from the proof of Prop. 8.10 below shows that the function x 	→
R
R G+(x, y)f(y)dy
satisﬁes the Sommerfeld radiation condition.

The function ϕ satisﬁes the Helmholtz equation Lϕ = f on R, and it has the
following asymptotic behavior.

This means that the solution asymptotically behaves like
• an incoming wave of wave number k > 0 at x = −∞, and
• an outgoing wave of wave number k > 0 at x = +∞.
This wave is reﬂected under the inﬂuence of the external source f.

8.5.3 The Advanced Green’s Function
Let k > 0. If the function ϕ is a solution of the Helmholtz equation
„
−d2
dx2 −k2
«
ϕ(x) = f(x),
x ∈R,
then the substitution k 	→−k generates a new solution of the Helmholtz equation.
For example, the retarded fundamental solution F+(x) := ieik|x|
2k
passes over to F−
where
F−(x) := −ie−ik|x|
2k
,
x ∈R
is called the advanced fundamental solution. We have
LF±(x) = δ(x),
x ∈R.
In terms of physics,
• the retarded fundamental function F+ describes an outgoing wave at the inﬁnite
points x = −∞and x = +∞;
• the advanced fundamental solution F−describes an incoming wave at the inﬁnite
points x = −∞and x = +∞.

8.5 The Method of the Green’s Function in a Nutshell
737
Suppose that we are given the function f ∈D(R). Replacing the retarded Green’s
function G+(x, y) := F+(x −y) by the advanced Green’s function
G−(x, y) := F−(x −y)
x, y ∈R,
the most general smooth solution of the Helmholtz equation Lϕ = f on R reads as
ϕ(x) = a+eikx + a−e−ikx +

G−(x, y)f(y)dy,

where a± are arbitrary complex numbers. If we add the Sommerfeld radiation
condition for incoming waves
dϕ(x)
dx
= ∓ikϕ(x) + o(1),
x →±∞,
then we obtain the unique smooth solution of the Helmholtz equation Lϕ = f
by setting a± = 0. The retarded Green’s function G+ and the advanced Green’s
function satisfy G−satisfy the following equation

Fix k > 0. We know that the equation

F(x) = δ(x),
x ∈R
(8.65)
has the two solutions
F±(x) := ±ie±i|x|k

x ∈R,
in the sense of tempered distributions. We want to obtain F+ and F−by using two
diﬀerent perturbation methods with respect to the small parameter ε > 0, and by
carrying out the limit ε →+0.
The perturbed retarded fundamental solution. Let us replace the original
problem (8.65) by the perturbed problem
−
„ d2

«
F+,ε(x) = δ(x),
x ∈R
(8.66)
for ﬁxed parameter ε > 0.
Proposition 8.11 In the sense of tempered distributions, equation (8.66) has the
solution
F+,ε(x) := iei|x|√
k2+εi
2
√
k2 + εi ,
x ∈R,
and we have the limit limε→+0 F+,ε = F+.

Here, we use the principal value of the square root. The perturbed retarded
Green’s function is deﬁned by
G+
ε (x, y) := F+,ε(x −y),
x, y ∈R.
Proof. Replacing k by
√
k2 + εi and using the same argument as in the proof of
Prop. 8.8, we obtain F+,ε. It remains to show that

ε →+0.
Note that the damping factor e−1
2 ε|x|/2k appears if ε > 0. This implies
lim
ε→+0 F+,ε(x) = F+(x)
for all
x ∈R.
Finally, we get (8.67).

The perturbed advanced fundamental solution. Again ﬁx k > 0 and
choose the parameter ε > 0. Consider now the perturbed equation
−
„ d2
dx2 + k2 −εi
«
F−,ε(x) = δ(x),
x ∈R
(8.69)
which diﬀers from (8.66) by changing the sign of the perturbation term.
Proposition 8.12 In the sense of tempered distributions, equation (8.69) has the
solution
F−,ε(x) := −ie−i|x|√
k2−εi
2

k2 −εi ,
x ∈R,
and we have the limit limε→+0 F−,ε = F−.
The proof proceeds as above. The perturbed advanced Green’s function is deﬁned
by

Damped time-depending waves and the principle of limiting absorp-
tion. Let ε > 0. We want to discuss the physics behind the perturbation method
above.
(i) The distant future. Suppose that the function ϕε satisﬁes the perturbed
Helmholtz equation
−
„ d2
dx2 + k2 + εi
«
ϕε(x) = 0.

8.5 The Method of the Green’s Function in a Nutshell
739
Then the time-dependent function
ψ(x, t) = eit√
k2+iεϕε(x),
x, t ∈R
satisﬁes the wave equation ψtt −ψxx = 0. Because of (8.68), the function ψ is
approximated by the wave
ψ+(x, t) := eikte−1
2 εt/2kϕε(x),
x ∈R
which is damped as time t goes to +∞. Furthermore, we have the following
asymptotic behavior: limt→+∞ψ(x, t) = ϕε(x) for all x ∈R.
(ii) The remote past. Similarly, suppose that the function ϕε satisﬁes the perturbed
Helmholtz equation
−
„ d2
dx2 + k2 −εi
«
ϕε(x) = 0.
Then, the time-dependent function
ψ(x, t) = eit√
k2−iεϕε(x),
x, t ∈R
satisﬁes the wave equation ψtt −ψxx = 0. Because of
p
k2 −εi = k
„
1 −εi
2k2 + O(ε2)
«
,
ε →+0,
the function ψ is approximated by the wave
ψ−(x, t) := eikte
1
2 εt/2kϕε(x),
x, t ∈R
which is damped as time t goes to −∞. Furthermore, we have the following
asymptotic behavior: limt→−∞ψ(x, t) = ϕε(x) for all x ∈R.
This shows that the perturbation terms ±εi arising in (8.66) and (8.69) correspond
to damping (or absorption) eﬀects.
This motivates the choice of the sign of the perturbation terms.
The limit ε →+0 describes the vanishing of absorption. This explains why Propo-
sitions 8.11 and 8.12 are called the limiting absorption principle in mathematics.
In physics, the limit ε →+0 is also called the adiabatic limit.
8.5.5 Feynman’s Regularized Fourier Method
Formal approach. The following method is due to Feynman. This method and
its straightforward generalization to higher dimensions is frequently used in the
physics textbooks on quantum ﬁeld theory. The basic idea is to use the Fourier
method in order to compute fundamental solutions of the Helmholtz equation. To
begin with, recall that the Fourier transform ˆf of the function f is given by
ˆf(p) =
1
√
2π
Z
R
f(x)e−ipxdx,
p ∈R,
(8.70)
and we have the inversion formula

8. Quantum Particles on the Real Line
f(x) =

√
2π
Z
R
ˆf(p)eipxdx,
x ∈R.
(8.71)
It follows from
d
dxf(x) =
1
√
2π
Z
R
ip ˆf(p)eipx dx,
x ∈R
that
• the operation of diﬀerentiation f(x) 	→
d
dxf(x) is transformed into
• the operation of multiplication ˆf(p) 	→ip ˆf(p).
The function p 	→ip is called the symbol of the diﬀerential operator
d
dx. Finally,
using the Dirac delta function, we formally get
ˆδ(p) =
1
√
2π
Z
R
δ(x)e−ipxdx =

p ∈R.
Formal inversion yields s
δ(x) = 1
2π
Z
R
eipxdp,
x ∈R.
Instead of ˆf, we also write the symbol Ff.21 After these preparations, let us start
with the equation
−
„ d2
dx2 + k2
«
F(x) = δ(x),
x ∈R.
(8.72)
Using the Fourier transform, we get
(p2 −k2) ˆF(p) = ˆδ(p) =
1
√
2π

Hence
ˆF(p) =

2π (p2 −k2)
.
This implies
F(x) = 1
2π
Z
R
eipx
p2 −k2 dp.
(8.73)
Unfortunately, this approach completely fails. In fact, the integral (8.73) does not
exist because of the singularity at the points p = ±k.
To cure this defect by regularization, let us pass to the perturbed equations
−
„ d2
dx2 + k2 ± εi
«
F±,ε(x) = δ(x),
x ∈R
(8.74)
where ε > 0 is suﬃciently small. Replacing k2 by k2 ±εi, the Fourier method yields
F±,ε(x) = 1
2π
Z
R
eipx
p2 −k2 ∓εi dp.
(8.75)
Rigorous approach. We now want to investigate the properties of the integrals
(8.75) in rigorous terms.
21 The rigorous Fourier transformation for both functions and tempered distribu-
tions is thoroughly studied in Chap. 11 of Vol. I.

8.5 The Method of the Green’s Function in a Nutshell
741
Theorem 8.13 Let ε > 0 be suﬃciently small. Then the integrals (8.75) are equal
to
F±,ε(x) = ±ie±i|x|√
k2±εi
2
√
k2 ± εi
,
x ∈R.
Surprisingly enough, this coincides with the functions obtained in Sect. 8.5.4 by
using a completely diﬀerent method. Before giving the proof, let us discuss this
result. By Sect. 8.5.4, the following are true in the sense of tempered distributions.
(i) Adiabatic limit: limε→+0 F±,ε = F±.
(ii) Fundamental solution: F+ and F−are solutions of the equation (8.72).
(iii) Fourier transform: limε→+0 F(F±,ε) = F(F±).22
Statement (ii) can be written as
lim
ε→+0

2π
Z
R
eipx
p2 −k2 ∓εi dp = F±(x),
x ∈R.
(8.76)
This is a rigorous statement in the language of tempered distributions. If we for-
mally interchange the limit with the integration, then we get

In contrast to (8.76), this is only a mnemonic formula.
Proof of Theorem 8.13. We will use Cauchy’s residue method from Section 4.4
of Volume I. Let k > 0 and ε > 0.
(I) Retarded case: Fix the real number x and consider the integral
F+,ε(x) :=

f(p) := 1
2π ·

8.6 The Lippmann–Schwinger Integral Equation
We are given the smooth potential U : R →R with compact support. For ﬁxed
k > 0 and all real values x, set ϕfree(x) := eikx. The Lippmann–Schwinger integral
equation
ϕ(x) = ϕfree(x) −κ
Z
R
G+(x, y)U(y)ϕ(y)dy,
x ∈R
(8.77)
plays a crucial role for studying scattering processes of a quantum particle on the
real line under the inﬂuence of the potential U. Recall that G+(x, y) is equal to
i
2keik|x−y|.
Proposition 8.14 If ϕ : R →C is a smooth solution of the integral equation
(8.77), then it is a solution of the stationary Schr¨odinger equation23
−ϕ′′(x) −k2ϕ(x) + κU(x)ϕ(x) = 0,
x ∈R.
Furthermore, the solution ϕ of (8.77) has the following asymptotics:
(i) ϕ(x) ≃eikx + ϱ+(k)e−ikx as x →−∞with the reﬂection coeﬃcient
ϱ+(k) :=

τ+(k) := 1 + 1
2ki
Z
R
U(y)ϕ(y)e−ikydy.
This follows immediately from Propositions 8.9 and 8.10.
8.6.1 The Born Approximation
Recall that ϕfree(x) := eikx for ﬁxed k > 0 and all x ∈R. Replacing ϕ by ϕfree, we
obtain the following approximative solution
ϕ(x) = ϕfree(x) −κ
Z
R
G+(x, y)U(y)ϕfree(y)dy,
x ∈R
of the Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation (8.77). Furthermore, the reﬂection
and transition coeﬃcients of ϕ read as
ϱ+(k) =
1
2ki
Z
R
U(y)e2ikydy,
τ+(k) = 1 + 1

U(y)dy.
This is called the Born approximation of the scattering process under the action
of the potential U. As we will show in the next section, the Born approximation
works well if the coupling constant κ > 0 is suﬃciently small.
23 Recall that we set ℏ:= 1 and m := 1

8.6.2 The Existence and Uniqueness Theorem via Banach’s Fixed
Point Theorem
Deﬁne the norm ||ϕ||∞:= supx∈R |ϕ(x)|. By deﬁnition, the space Cb(R) consists
of all continuous functions ϕ : R →C with ||ϕ||∞< ∞. This space is a complex
Banach space equipped with the norm ||.||∞.24
Theorem 8.15 There exists a number κ0 > 0 such that, for each given coupling
constant κ ∈]0, κ0[, the Lippmann–Schwinger integral equation (8.77) has a unique
solution ϕ in the Banach space Cb(R). This solution can be obtained by the iterative
method
ϕn+1(x) = ϕ0(x) −κ
Z ∞
∞
G+(x, y)U(y)ϕn(y)dy,
x ∈R, n = 0, 1, . . .
with ϕ0 := ϕfree. The sequence (ϕn) converges to ϕ in the Banach space Cb(R), that
is,
lim
n→∞||ϕn −ϕ||∞= 0.
The ﬁrst approximation ϕ1 coincides with the Born approximation.
Proof. Deﬁne
(Bϕ)(x) := −
Z ∞
−∞
G+(x, y)U(y)ϕ(y)dy
for all
x ∈R.
Set X := Cb(R). We have to solve the operator equation
ϕ = ϕfree + κBϕ,
ϕ ∈X.
(8.78)
The operator B : X →X is linear and bounded. In fact, since |G+(x, y)| is uniformly
bounded and
R ∞
−∞|U(y)|dy < ∞, we get
|(Bϕ)(x)| ≤C · sup
y∈R
|ϕ(y)|
for all
x ∈R
where C denotes some constant. Hence ||Bϕ||∞≤C||ϕ||∞for all ϕ ∈X. This
implies ||B|| ≤C. If ||κB|| = |κ| · ||B|| < 1, then the inverse operator
(I −κB)−1 : X →X
exists and is bounded. Thus, the equation (8.78) has the unique solution
ϕ = (I −κB)−1ϕfree.
Here, (I −κB)−1 = I + κB + κ2B2 + . . . This geometric series (also called Neu-
mann series)25 is convergent with respect to the norm on the Banach space X.
Consequently, the inﬁnite series
ϕ = lim

24 This follows from the fact that the uniform limit of a sequence of continuous

8.6 The Lippmann–Schwinger Integral Equation

is convergent in the Banach space X. This corresponds to the convergence
ϕ = lim
n→∞ϕn+1
of the iterative method ϕn+1 = ϕ0 + κBϕn, n = 1, 2, . . . with ϕ0 := ϕfree.
This argument is a special case of the Banach ﬁxed-point theorem (also called
the contraction principle) (see Zeidler (1995a), Sect. 1.6, quoted on page 1049). 2
8.6.3 Hypoellipticity
Let N = 1, 2, . . . We want to study the smoothness properties of the distributive
solutions ϕ of the linear diﬀerential equation
Lϕ = f
on RN.
(8.79)
Here, we assume that the symbol L denotes a general linear diﬀerential operator of
order m = 1, 2, . . . with constant complex coeﬃcients26
L :=
X
|α|≤m
aα∂α.
We are given the distribution f ∈D′(RN), and we are looking for a distribution
ϕ ∈D′(RN) such that equation (8.79) is valid. Recall from Volume I that the
solutions F ∈D′(RN) of the equation
LF = δ
are called fundamental solutions of the diﬀerential operator L. Here, the symbol
δ denotes the Dirac delta distribution given by δ(χ) := χ(0) for all test functions
χ ∈D(RN). The symbol ˆL of the diﬀerential operator L is deﬁned by
ˆL(p) :=
X
|α|≤m
aαi|α|pα
for all
p ∈RN.
This is obtained from the operator L by replacing the diﬀerential operator
∂
∂xj by
the complex variable ipj. In terms of the Fourier transform, we get
F(Lϕ) = ˆLF(ϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈S(RN).
Here, F(ϕ) denotes the Fourier transform of the function ϕ. In other words, the
symbol ˆL tells us how the diﬀerential operator L acts in the Fourier space (momen-
tum space) by multiplication.
Theorem 8.16 The following three statements are equivalent.
(i) Hypoellipticity: The diﬀerential operator L is hypoelliptic. By deﬁnition, this
means that
sing supp ϕ = sing supp Lϕ
for all
ϕ ∈D′(Ω)
and all open subsets Ω of RN.
26 We exclude the trivial case where L = 0.

746
8. Quantum Particles on the Real Line
(ii) Fundamental solution: The diﬀerential operator L has a fundamental solu-
tion F with trivial singular support, that is, sing supp F = {0}.
(iii) Symbol: The partial derivatives ∂β ˆL of order 1, 2, . . . of the symbol have the
asymptotic behavior
lim
|p|→∞
˛˛˛˛˛
∂β ˆL(p)
ˆL(p)
˛˛˛˛˛ = 0,
p ∈RN.
The proof can be found in H¨ormander (1983), Vol. 2, Sect. 11.1. Hypoelliptic diﬀer-
ential operators were characterized by H¨ormander in 1955.27 For his contributions
to the theory of diﬀerential operators, H¨ormander was awarded the Fields medal in
1962.
Recall from Sect. 11.5.1 of Vol. I that the singular support of the distribution
ϕ ∈D′(RN) is the largest open subset Ω of RN such that ϕ is smooth on Ω. In
particular, if condition (ii) is met, then the smoothness of the function f : RN →C
implies the smoothness of all the solutions ϕ : RN →C of equation (8.79). In terms
of the wavefront set,28 the linear diﬀerential operator L is hypoelliptic iﬀ
WF(ϕ) = WF(Lϕ)
for all
ϕ ∈D′(Ω)
and all open subsets Ω of RN.
Example. Consider the Helmholtz equation
„
−d2
dx2 −k2
«
ϕ = f
on R
(8.80)
for ﬁxed k > 0. The symbol of the Helmholtz operator L = −d2
dx2 −k2 is obtained
by the substitution
d
dx ⇒ip. Hence
ˆL(p) = p2 −k2.
Obviously,
lim
p→±∞
ˆL(n)(p)
ˆL(p)
= 0,
n = 1, 2, . . .
The fundamental solution F+(x) = ieik|x|
2k
of the Helmholtz operator is smooth on
R \ {0}. Hence sing supp F+ = {0}. Thus, the Helmholtz operator is hypoelliptic.
This means that all of the solutions ϕ ∈D′(R) of equation (8.80) are smooth
functions on R if the given right-hand side f : R →C is smooth.
Further examples of hypoelliptic diﬀerential operators are given by the Laplace
equation and the heat equation (resp. diﬀusion equation) in RN with N = 1, 2, . . .
In contrast to this, the wave equation is not hypoelliptic. This reﬂects the typical
fact that the wave equation describes the propagation of waves which may possess
discontinuities (e.g. jumps of the electromagnetic ﬁeld).

9. A Glance at General Scattering Theory
The time-dependent picture of the scattering process has been described
in 1945 by Christian Møller (1902–1980). A stationary picture has been
formulated by John Wheeler (born 1911) in 1937. It was elaborated by
Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976) in 1943.1
In 1930 Heisenberg lectured at the University of Chicago on the new quan-
tum mathematics. His assistant there was the young American physicist
Frank Hoyt, who helped prepare the English lecture notes. During the Sec-
ond World War, Hoyt joined the Manhattan project for building nuclear
weapons; one of his assignments was to scrutinize every wartime publica-
tion of Heisenberg and see if it could be a by-product of bomb research.
Hoyt studied very thoroughly the two papers Heisenberg published in 1943
on scattering theory, and as he told me later, concluded that they had no
bearing on nuclear weapon. This may have saved Heisenberg’s life, for the
OSS, the wartime precursor of the CIA, had been training an agent to
assassinate him.2
Peter Lax, 2003
The main tool for studying experimentally the properties of elementary particles
are scattering processes performed in particle accelerators. Physicists measure cross
sections and the mathematical theory has to develop methods for computing cross
sections.
The computation of cross sections for scattering processes is based on the
computation of transition probabilities.
In turn, the transition probabilities are encoded into a speciﬁc unitary operator,
which is called the scattering operator (or the Heisenberg S-matrix). The mathe-
matics of scattering processes in quantum mechanics and quantum ﬁeld theory is
sophisticated. Until now, there exists a complete mathematical scattering theory
for the scattering of N particles in quantum mechanics (i.e., the scattering of atoms
and molecules), but such a complete theory is missing in quantum ﬁeld theory.
The reason for the mathematical diﬃculties is the physical phenomenon of
clustering in scattering processes.

9. A Glance at General Scattering Theory
In a particle accelerator, the incoming free particles might form bound states for
a ﬁnite time by clustering. At the end of the process, the particles are again free
particles. The intermediate cluster states of ﬁnite lifetime are also called resonances
in physics. In the quantum-mechanical scattering of N particles, the complexity of
the cluster states and the number of diﬀerent scattering channels becomes more and
more complex if N increases. Here the critical case N ≥4 is much more complicated
than the case N = 3.
The rigorous scattering theory for quantum N-particle systems is a high-
light in mathematical physics.
From the mathematical point of view, scattering theory studies the perturbation of
the absolutely continuous spectrum of self-adjoint operators on Hilbert spaces. In
what follows, we make the following hypotheses.
(H1) The perturbed Hamiltonian: The operator H : D(H) →X is self-adjoint on
the dense subset D(H) of the complex inﬁnite-dimensional separable Hilbert
space X. The domain of deﬁnition D(H) is dense in X. We have the splitting
H = Hfree + U.
(H2) The free Hamiltonian: The operator Hfree : D(Hfree) →X is self-adjoint
on the dense subset D(Hfree) of X. The spectrum of Hfree coincides with its
absolutely continuous spectrum (i.e., both the pure point spectrum and the
singular spectrum of Hfree are empty).
(H3) The perturbation: The operator U : D(U) →X is symmetric on the dense
subset D(U) of X. The singular spectrum of the perturbed Hamiltonian H
is empty. We distinguish between short-range potentials U (e.g., the Yukawa
potential) and long-range potentials (e.g., the Coulomb potential).3
From the physical point of view, the free Hamiltonian Hfree describes the unper-
turbed free motion in the absence of bound states. This corresponds to the missing
pure point spectrum of Hfree. Our goal is to study the perturbed motion governed
by the perturbation potential U (e.g., the perturbed motion on the real line as
investigated below). We have the decomposition
X = Xbound ⊕Xscatt
into two orthogonal closed subspaces of the Hilbert space X, where Xbound and
Xscatt correspond to the pure point spectrum and the absolutely continuous spec-
trum of the perturbed Hamiltonian H, respectively (see (7.106) on page 503). Recall
that if ϕ ∈Xscatt, then the corresponding spectral measure has a density ϱ, that
is, the expectation value of the energy measured in the normalized state ϕ can be
represented as
¯E = ⟨ϕ|Hϕ⟩=
Z
R
ϱ(E)dE.
In terms of physics, the elements ψ(0) of the subspace Xbound (resp. Xscatt) are the
initial states of bound motion (resp. scattering motion) (see Fig. 8.1 on page 700).
The perturbed dynamics. Let us introduce
• the free Feynman propagator Pfree(t, t0) := e−i(t−t0)Hfree/ℏ, t ≥t0, and
• the perturbed Feynman propagator P(t, t0) := e−it(t−t0)H/ℏ, t ≥t0.
3 The mathematical scattering theory for long-range potentials is much more com-
plicated than for short-range potentials.

9.1 The Formal Basic Idea
749
In order to understand scattering processes, one has to study the following motions
of the quantum system under consideration.
• Free motion in the future: ψout(t) = Pfree(t, 0)ϕout for all times t ≥0.
• Free motion in the past: ψin(s) = Pfree(0, s)ϕin for all times s ≤0.
• Perturbed motion: ψ(t) = P(t, t0)ψ(t0) for all times t ≥t0.
The transition probability. Let t > 0. The real number
a(t, −t) := ⟨ψout(t)|P(t, −t)ψin(−t)⟩
(9.1)
is called the transition amplitude with respect to the time interval [−t, t]. Further-
more, the real number
p(t, −t) = |a(t, −t)|2
is called the transition probability with respect to the time interval [−t, t]. This
allows the following physical interpretation:
• Fix the time t > 0. Suppose that the physical system is in the free motion state
ψin(−t) = Pfree(0, −t)ϕin at the negative time −t.
• Then the system is in the state P(t, −t)ψin(−t) at the positive time t.
• Suppose that we measure the system at the positive time t, and we observe the
free motion state ψout(t) = P(t, 0)ϕout at time t.
Then the number p(t, −t) is the probability for this measurement. To be precise,
we assume that ψin(−t) and ψout(t) are normalized quantum states, that is,
||ψin(−t)|| = ||ψout(t)|| = 1
for all
t ≥0.
(9.2)
Since the propagators are unitary operators, it is suﬃcient to assume that the
condition (9.2) is satisﬁed, say, at time t = 0 (i.e., ||ϕin|| = ||ϕout|| = 1). This
implies ||P(t, −t)ψin(−t)|| = 1 for all t ≥0. Our goal is to compute the limit
a(+∞, −∞) :=
lim
t→+∞a(t, −t)
which yields the desired transition probability
p(+∞, −∞) := |a(+∞, −∞)|2
over the inﬁnite time interval [−∞, +∞]. In particle accelerators, this corresponds
to the transition probability over a fairly ‘long’ time interval.
9.1 The Formal Basic Idea
The scattering operator. We have (e−itHfree/ℏ)† = eitHfree/ℏfor the adjoint
operator. This implies
a(t, −t) = ⟨ϕout|eitHfreet/ℏP(t, −t)eitHfree/ℏϕin⟩.
Motivated by this expression, we deﬁne
S(t, −t) := eitHfreet/ℏP(t, −t)eitHfree/ℏ.
This is called the scattering operator with respect to the time interval [−t, t]. Sup-
pose that the limit

750
9. A Glance at General Scattering Theory
Sformal :=
lim
t→+∞S(t, −t)
(9.3)
exists. Then we get
a(+∞, −∞) :=
lim
t→+∞a(t, −t) = ⟨ϕout|Sformalϕin⟩,
which is called the S-matrix element with respect to the states ϕin and ϕout. This
yields the transition probability
p(+∞, −∞) = |⟨ϕin|Sformalϕout⟩|2.
The main problem is that
The limit (9.3) does not exist, as a rule.
To overcome this diﬃculty, we will introduce the notion of wave operators.
The trick of Møller’s wave operators. Observe that P(t, −t) is equal to
the product P(t, 0)P(0, −t). Therefore, the transition amplitude can be written as
a(t, −t) = ⟨e−itHfree/ℏϕout|P(t, 0)P(0, −t)eitHfree/ℏϕin⟩.
Hence
a(t, −t) = ⟨eitH/ℏe−itHfree/ℏϕout|eisH/ℏe−isHfree/ℏϕin⟩,
where we set s := −t. Suppose that the following limits exist:
• Woutϕout := limt→+∞eitH/ℏe−itHfree/ℏϕout.
• Winϕout := lims→−∞eisH/ℏe−isHfree/ℏϕin.
Letting t →+∞, we obtain
a(+∞, −∞) = ⟨Woutϕout|Winϕin⟩.
Finally, suppose that the element Winϕin is contained in the domain of the adjoint
operator W †
out. Then
a(+∞, ∞) = ⟨ϕout|W †
outWinϕin⟩.
Introducing the scattering operator
Sϕin := W †
outWinϕin,
(9.4)
we obtain a(+∞, ∞) = ⟨ϕout|Sϕin⟩. Finally, we get the transition probability
p(+∞, −∞) := |⟨ϕout|Sϕin⟩|2.
(9.5)
In particular, this procedure replaces the formal limit (9.3) by the rigorous limit
a(+∞, −∞) = lim
t→∞⟨ϕout|S(t, −t)ϕin⟩= ⟨ϕout|Sϕin⟩.
(9.6)
This is the limit of the corresponding matrix elements. We will show below that for
complete wave operators, the scattering operator
S : X →X
is unitary, and the limit (9.6) exists for all ϕin, ϕout ∈X. In terms of weak conver-
gence, this means that
w −
lim
t→+∞S(t, −t)ϕin = Sϕin
for all
ϕin ∈X.
(9.7)
Rigorous scattering theory studies the properties of the Møller wave operators and
uses the two key relations (9.4) and (9.5). Let us summarize some crucial results.

9.2 The Rigorous Time-Dependent Approach
A mathematical basis for the quantum-mechanical scattering theory was
laid out in terms of wave operators about 30 years ago. For instance the
scattering operator was expressed as a product of wave operators. As a
result, the main mathematical problem of the mathematical quantum-
mechanical scattering theory was deﬁned as the proof of establishing their
properties, the latter being
(i) isometry,
(ii) mutual orthogonality, and
(iii) completeness.
The existence proof was found very fast by Cook.4 At the same time it
was shown by Jauch that the existence implies readily the isometry and
mutual orthogonality. . . The completeness however proved, from the very
beginning, to be a hard nut and required a certain mathematical sophisti-
cation in tackling it. . . These notes are devoted to the mathematical foun-
dations of the quantum N-body problem. A small part of them describes
essentially known results in the ﬁeld, while the rest is concentrated on the
crux of the problem; the N-body asymptotic completeness.5
Israel Michael Sigal, 1983
Our monograph would be much simpler, shorter and less interesting if we
restricted ourselves to short range potentials. In fact, long-range scattering
(including the Coulomb potential) is the central subject of our monograph.
We study it under very general conditions, which are motivated by the
mathematical structure of the problem.6

9. A Glance at General Scattering Theory
Asymptotically free motion in the distant future. The theory of Møller’s
wave operators is based on the following simple observation.
Proposition 9.1 For the perturbed dynamics ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ(0), the following
two conditions are equivalent:
(i) There exists a state ϕout ∈X such that
lim
t→+∞(e−itH/ℏψ(0) −e−itHfree/ℏϕout) = 0.
(ii) The limit ψ(0) = limt→+∞eitH/ℏe−itHfree/ℏϕout exists.
Proof. We have the identity
e−itH/ℏψ(0) −e−itHfree/ℏϕout = e−itH/ℏ(ψ(0) −eitH/ℏe−itHfree/ℏϕout).
Since the operator e−itH/ℏ: X →X is unitary, we get
||e−itH/ℏψ(0) −e−itHfree/ℏϕout|| = ||ψ(0) −eitH/ℏe−itHfree/ℏϕout||.
Letting t →+∞, we get the claim.
2
By deﬁnition, the motion ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ(0), t ∈R is asymptotically free at
time t = +∞iﬀcondition (i) is satisﬁed. We say that the wave operator Wout exists
iﬀthe limit
Woutϕout :=
lim
t→+∞eitH/ℏe−itHfree/ℏϕout
exists for all ϕout ∈X.
Asymptotically free motion in the remote past. We now replace t = +∞
by t = −∞. For the perturbed dynamics ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ(0), the following two
conditions are equivalent:
(i) There exists a state ϕin ∈X such that
lim
t→−∞(e−itH/ℏψ(0) −e−itHfree/ℏϕin) = 0.
(ii) The limit ψ(0) = limt→+∞eitH/ℏe−itHfree/ℏϕint exists.
By deﬁnition, the motion ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ(0), t ∈R is asymptotically free at time
t = −∞iﬀcondition (i) is satisﬁed. We say that the wave operator Win exists iﬀ
the limit
Winϕin :=

The motion ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏψ(0), t ∈R is called a scattering process iﬀit is
asymptotically free at times t = −∞and t = +∞, that is, we have ψ(0) ∈im(Win)∩
im(Wout).
Completeness of the wave operators. The wave operators Win and Wout
are called complete iﬀthese wave operators exist and
im(Wout) = im(Win) = Xscatt.
In this case, the following hold: The Hilbert space X = Xbound ⊕Xscatt is decom-
posed into the orthogonal closed subspaces Xbound and Xscatt. Consider the motion
ψ(t) := e−itH/ℏψ(0) for all times t ∈R.

9.3 The Rigorous Time-Independent Approach
753
• If ψ(0) ∈Xbound, then ψ(t) ∈Xbound for all t ∈R. This is called a bound motion.
• The motion t →ψ(t) is a scattering process iﬀψ(0) ∈Xscatt.
The main theorem on the scattering operator. We set S := W †
outWin
provided this operator exists. Furthermore, set S(t, s) := e−i(t−s)H/ℏfor all t, s ∈R.
Theorem 9.2 If the wave operators Win and Wout are complete, then the following
hold:
(i) The two wave operators Win, Wout : X →Xscatt are unitary. That is, the
Hilbert spaces X and Xscatt are unitarily equivalent.
(ii). The scattering operator S : X →X is unitary. Explicitly, we have the
relation S = W −1
outWin.
(iii) We have the weak limit
Sϕin = w −
lim
t→+∞S(t, −t)ϕin
for all
ϕin ∈X.
This implies the limit of the corresponding matrix elements, that is,
lim
t→+∞⟨ϕout|S(t, −t)ϕin⟩= ⟨ϕout|Sϕin⟩
for all
ϕin, ϕout ∈X.
(iv) The one-parameter unitary groups generated by the Hamiltonians H and
Hfree on Xscatt and X, respectively, are unitarily equivalent. Explicitly,
e−itH/ℏϕ = Wine−itHfree/ℏW −1
in ϕ
for all
ϕ ∈Xscatt, t ∈R.
The same is true if we replace Win by Wout.
The proof of this theorem together with the proof of the following Theorem 9.3
can be found in M. Reed and B. Simon (1979), Methods of Modern Mathematical
Physics, Vol. III, Sect. XI.3, Academic Press, New York, 1979.
The completeness theorem for wave operators. The following theorem
relates the completeness of wave operators to compact perturbations.
Theorem 9.3 The wave operators Win and Wout are complete if one of the fol-
lowing two conditions is satisﬁed:
(i) The diﬀerence H −Hfree is of trace class (Kato–Rosenblum condition).
(ii) The diﬀerence (H + iI)−1 −(Hfree + iI)−1 is of trace class (Kuroda–Birman
condition).
9.3 The Rigorous Time-Independent Approach
The deﬁnition of the wave operators above has been based on the time limits
t →+∞and t →−∞. This is the time-dependent approach to scattering theory
(also called instationary scattering theory). In mathematics and physics, one also
uses the time-independent (or stationary) approach. The following theorem shows
that the wave operators can be computed by the time-independent formulas
Woutϕ = lim
ε→+0

R(E −iε)Rfree(E + iε)ϕ dE,
Winϕ = lim

Here, R(λ) := (λI −H)−1 and Rfree(λ) := (λI −Hfree)−1 are the resolvents of the
Hamiltonian H and the free Hamiltonian Hfree.

9. A Glance at General Scattering Theory
Theorem 9.4 If the wave operators exist, then we have the formulas (9.8) for all
elements ϕ of the complex Hilbert space X.
The proof can be found in Sigal (1983), p. 16, quoted on page 751. The proof
essentially uses the operator-valued Dirac delta function and the Abel limit
A −lim
t→+∞f(t) := lim
ε→+0
Z ∞

εe−εtf(t)dt
dating back to Abel (1802–1829). The Abel limit generalizes the classical limit
limt→+∞f(t). In fact, if this classical limit exists for the given continuous function
f : [0, ∞[→X, then
A −
lim
t→+∞f(t) =
lim

(9.9)
For the proof, see Problem 9.10.7 The discrete variant of the Abel limit reads as

If the sequence (sn) is bounded in the Hilbert space X and the limit limn→∞sn

If the series P∞

Theorem 9.4 indicates that scattering theory is closely related to analytic func-
tions with values in a Banach space and their boundary values.
9.4 Applications to Quantum Mechanics
Let us consider the Schr¨odinger equation
iℏψt(x, t) = −ℏ2
2mψxx(x, t) + U(x)ψ(x, t),
x, t ∈R
(9.10)
for the motion of a quantum particle of mass m > 0 on the real line. We assume
that the potential function U : R →R is smooth. We set
U0 := inf
x∈R U(x),
and we postulate that U0 > −∞.8
7 Far reaching generalizations of the Abel limit and their applications to scatter-
ing theory can be found in H. Baumg¨artel and M. Wollenberg, Mathematical
Scattering Theory, Birkh¨auser, Basel, 1983.
8 For the energy Eclass := 1
2m ˙x2 + U(x) of a classical particle on the real line, we
have Eclass ≥U0.

9.4 Applications to Quantum Mechanics
755
We are interested in getting information on the possible energy values of
the quantum particle.
As we will see below, the structure of the energy spectrum of (9.10) strongly depends
on the shape of the potential U. For any function ϕ ∈D(R), deﬁne
(Hpreϕ)(x) := −ℏ2
2mϕ′′(x) + U(x)ϕ(x)
for all
x ∈R.
The linear operator Hpre : D(R) →L2(R) on the complex Hilbert space L2(R) is
called the pre-Hamiltonian for the motion of the quantum particle. We have9
⟨ϕ|Hpreϕ⟩≥U0⟨ϕ|ϕ⟩
for all
ϕ ∈D(R).
That is, the symmetric operator Hpre is semi-bounded from below, in the sense of
Friedrichs. Let us summarize some important results. The proofs can be found in
the textbooks by M. Schechter, Operator Methods in Quantum Mechanics, North-
Holland, Amsterdam, 1982, and F. Berezin and M. Shubin, The Schr¨odinger Equa-
tion, Kluwer, Dordrecht, 1991. The operator Hpre is essentially self-adjoint on the
Hilbert space L2(R). This means that the operator Hpre has a unique self-adjoint
extension
H : D(H) →L2(R)
which is called the Hamiltonian of the quantum dynamics. Observe that we have
the following inclusions: D(Hpre) = D(R) ⊆D(H) ⊆L2(R). Our goal is
• to characterize the domain of deﬁnition D(H) and
• the spectrum σ(H) of H. Recall that precisely the points E in the spectrum σ(H)
represent the possible energy values of the quantum particle. In particular, we
will get
E ≥U0
for all
E ∈σ(H).
That is, the lower bound U0 for the energies of the classical particle is also a
lower bound for the energies of the quantum particle.
In what follows we will use the classiﬁcation of the spectrum σ(H) introduced
on page 504. In all the situations considered below, the singular spectrum of the
Hamiltonian H is empty, and we have the orthogonal decomposition
X = Xbound ⊕Xscatt
of the Hilbert space X := L2(R).
• If the Hamiltonian H has no eigenvectors in the Hilbert space X, then we obtain
Xbound = {0} and Xscatt = X.
9 In fact, let ϕ ∈D(R). Then integration by parts tells us that the inner product
⟨ϕ|Hpreϕ⟩=

• If the Hamiltonian H has at least one eigenvector in X, then the space Xbound
is the closed linear hull of the set of eigenvectors of H, and the linear subspace
space Xscatt = X⊥
bound of X is the orthogonal complement to Xbound.
For any ϕ0 ∈Xscatt, the dynamics ψ(t) = e−itH/ℏϕ0 for all t ∈R corresponds to
a scattering motion (i.e., asymptotically free motion as t →±∞). The pure point
spectrum σpp(H) of the Hamiltonian H is the closure of the set of eigenvalues of H.
The absolutely continuous spectrum σac(H) of H is the spectrum of the restriction

(Hfreeϕ)(x) = −ℏ2
2mϕ′′(x),

in the sense of distributions.10 The operator Hfree is called the free Hamiltonian.
For the spectrum, we have Xbound = {0}, as well as X = Xscatt and

σpp(H) = ∅,
where σess(H) denotes the essential spectrum of H.

σac(H) = σess(H) = ∅.
The operator H has the eigenvalues E0, E1, . . . with limn→+∞Ej = +∞and
Hϕj = Ejϕj,
j = 0, 1, 2, . . .
All the eigenvalues E0, E1, . . . are simple. The smooth functions ϕ0, ϕ1, . . . form a
complete orthonormal system in X = L2(R). The function ϕ0 has no zeros, and
ϕn has precisely n zeros if n = 1, 2, . . . We have ϕ ∈D(H) iﬀϕ ∈L2(R) and

(ii) Scattering processes: The wave operators Win, Wout with respect to H, Hfree
are complete. In particular, the operators
Win : X →Xscatt,
Wout : X →Xscatt
are unitary. If ϕ0 ∈Xscatt, then
e−itH/ℏϕ0 = Wine−itHfree/ℏW −1
in ϕ0
for all
t ∈R.
This tells us that the scattering dynamics under the inﬂuence of the potential
U is unitarily equivalent to the free motion with vanishing potential.

9.5 A Glance at Quantum Field Theory
In quantum ﬁeld theory, one encounters the crucial situation where
• the free Hamiltonian Hfree : D(Hfree) →Xfree and
• the Hamiltonian H : D(H) →X of interaction
are deﬁned on diﬀerent Hilbert spaces Xfree and X, respectively. The corresponding
Haag–Ruelle theory is studied in the monograph by Reed and Simon (1979), Vol.
III, Sect. XI.16, quoted on page 759.12 We also refer to the monograph by Iagolnitzer
(1993), quoted on page 759. Let us brieﬂy discuss the basic idea of the modiﬁed
wave operators. We consider the following motions of the quantum system:
• ψ(t) := e−itH/ℏψ(0) (scattering process on the Hilbert space X of interaction).
• ψout(t) := e−itHfree/ℏϕout, t ≥0 (free motion on the Hilbert space Xfree in the
future).
• ψin(t) := e−itHfree/ℏϕin, t ≤0 (free motion on the Hilbert space Xfree in the past).
We also need a linear continuous operator J : Xfree →X which intertwines the
two Hilbert spaces. In this case, we replace the transition amplitude (9.1) by the
expression
a(t, −t) := ⟨Jψout(t)|P(t, −t)Jψin(−t)⟩
(9.11)
where P(t, t0) := e−i(t−t0)H/ℏ. Hence
a(t, −t) = ⟨eitH/ℏJe−itHfree/ℏϕout|eitH/ℏJeitHfreeℏϕin⟩.

• Woutϕout := limt→+∞eitH/ℏJe−itHfree/ℏϕout,
• Winϕin := lims→−∞eisH/ℏJe−isHfree/ℏϕin,
we get a(+∞, −∞) = limt→+∞⟨Woutϕout|Winϕin⟩. Finally, introducing the scat-
tering operator S := W †
outWin, we obtain
a(+∞, −∞) = ⟨ϕout|Sϕin⟩.
This yields the transition probability p(+∞, −∞) = |⟨ϕout|Sϕin⟩|2.

for all parameters p ∈P. We are given the function
f : M × P →C
where M is a nonempty Lebesgue measurable subset of RN (e.g., an open set)
with N = 1, 2, . . . , and the parameter space P is a nonempty open subset of
the real line R. Show that the function F : P →C is continuous if the following
conditions are satisﬁed.
(i) For each parameter p ∈P, the function x →f(x, p) is measurable on M
(e.g., x →f(x, p) is continuous for almost all x ∈M).15 For the elements
of measure theory and integration theory, we refer to Zeidler (1995a), Vol.

roughly speaking, each set of dimension < N has the N-dimensional Lebesgue

Then SS−1 = S−1S = I. The complex number λ is an eigenvalue of the matrix
S iﬀthe equation
Sx = λx,
x ∈C2, x ̸= 0
has a solution. This is equivalent to the fact that the matrix λI −S is not
invertible. Thus, the eigenvalues λ1, λ2 of the matrix S are the solutions of the
equation det(λI −S) = 0, λ ∈C. Explicitly,
λ2 −λ tr S + det S = 0,
λ ∈C.
This so-called characteristic equation of S is equal to (λ −λ1)(λ −λ2) = 0.18
Hence
tr S = λ1 + λ2,
det S = λ1λ2.

The set of eigenvalues λ1, λ2 is called the spectrum σ(S) of the matrix S. The

⟨x|Sy⟩= ⟨Sx|y⟩
for all

(9.19)
In fact, x†Sy = x†S†y = (Sx)†y. Conversely, the symmetry condition (9.19)
implies that the matrix S is self-adjoint.
9.5 Unitary matrices. By deﬁnition, the matrix S is called unitary iﬀit is invertible

Show that the following hold true.
(i) The matrix S is unitary iﬀS†S = I. This is equivalent to

s12s†

22 = 1,
s11s†
12 + s21s†
22 = 0,
s12s†
11 + s22s†
21 = 0.
(9.21)
This means that the two columns of the matrix S form an orthonormal
basis of C2.
(ii) The matrix S is unitary iﬀSS† = I. This is equivalent to
s11s†
11 + s12s†
12 = 1,
s21s†
21 + s22s†
22 = 1,
s11s†
21 + s12s†
22 = 0,
s21s†
11 + s22s†
12 = 0.
(9.22)
This means that the two rows of the matrix S form an orthonormal basis
of C2.
(iii) The matrix S is unitary iﬀit is invertible and S−1 = S†.
(iv) The matrix S is unitary iﬀthe adjoint matrix S† is unitary.
(v) If the matrix S is unitary, then | det S| = 1.
(vi) If the matrix S is unitary, then the eigenvalues of S lie on the unit circle.
This tells us that there exist real numbers δ1, δ2 ∈] −π, π] with
λj = eiδj,
j = 1, 2.
In quantum physics, the numbers δ1, δ2 are called the phases of the unitary
matrix S.
(vii) If the matrix S is self-adjoint, then its eigenvalues lie on the real axis.

(viii) Cayley transform. If the complex (2 × 2)-matrix H is self-adjoint, then
the matrix
S := (H −iI)(H + iI)−1
(9.23)
is well-deﬁned and unitary. Conversely,
H = i(I −S)−1(I + S).
The matrix S is called the Cayley transform of H.19 The Cayley transform
H →S is a bijective map from the set of self-adjoint matrices onto the set
of unitary matrices which do not have the eigenvalue λ = 1.
Solution: Ad (i)–(v). The condition (9.20) is equivalent to
(Sx)†(Sy) = x†S†Sy = x†y
for all
x, y ∈C2.
Thus, the matrix S is unitary iﬀS†S = I and S is invertible. However, the
relation S†S = I implies the invertibility of S. In fact,
1 = det I = det(S†S) = det S† · det S = (det S)† det S = | det S|2.
Finally, note that (9.21) is equivalent to the equation
S†S =

Ad (vi). If Sx = λx with x ̸= 0, then the relation (9.20) tells us that |λ|2 = 1.
In fact,
⟨x|x⟩= ⟨Sx|Sx⟩= λ†λ⟨x|x⟩= |λ|2⟨x|x⟩.
Ad (vii). If Sx = λx with x ̸= 0, then
λ⟨x|x⟩= ⟨x|Sx⟩= ⟨Sx|x⟩† = λ†⟨x|x⟩.
Ad (viii). Since the eigenvalues of the self-adjoint matrix H are real, we have
±i ∈ϱ(H). Thus, the matrices H±iI are invertible. The commutativity relation
(H −iI)(H + iI) = (H + iI)(H −iI)
implies (H +iI)−1(H −iI) = (H −iI)(H +iI)−1. It follows from (AB)† = B†A†
and (A−1)† = (A†)−1 along with (H ± iI)† = H† ∓iI† = H ∓iI that
S† = (H −iI)−1(H + iI).
Hence S†S = (H −iI)−1(H + iI)(H + iI)−1(H −iI) = I. Let us now study
the inverse Cayley transform. It follows from (9.23) that S(H + iI) = H −iI.
Hence
(I −S)H = i(I + S).
It remains to show that λ = 1 is not an eigenvalue of the Cayley transform S.
In fact, suppose that Sx = x. By (9.23),
(H + iI)x = (H −iI)x.
Hence x = 0. This implies 1 /∈σ(H). Consequently, the matrix I −S is invert-
ible. This yields H = i(I −S)−1(I + S).

10. Creation and Annihilation Operators
Use tensor products and Fock spaces for describing mathematically the
states of many-particle systems.
Folklore
We want to study a mathematical formalism which describes creation and annihi-
lation operators for many-particle systems. We have to distinguish between
• bosons (particles with integer spin like photons, gluons, vector bosons, and gravi-
tons) and
• fermions (particles with half-integer spin like electrons, neutrinos, and quarks).
The point is that the possible number of identical bosons being in the same physical
state is unlimited. In contrast to this, the behavior of fermions is governed by the
Pauli exclusion principle. This principle tells us that:
Two identical fermions cannot be in the same physical state.
Furthermore, we have the following general principle of indistinguishability for both
bosons and fermions:
It is impossible to distinguish between n identical particles.
Roughly speaking, in contrast to planets, elementary particles do not possess any
individuality. Fock spaces were introduced by Vladimir Fock (1898–1974) in 1932.1
10.1 The Bosonic Fock Space
The elements of the bosonic Fock space X are inﬁnite tuples of physical ﬁelds.
To display the main idea, we restrict ourselves to the prototype of complex-valued
ﬁelds2
ψ : R4 →C.

647 (in German). See also P. Jordan and E. Wigner, On the Pauli equivalence
principle, Z. Phys. 47 (1928), 631–658 (in German).
2 Important generalizations will be studied later on in connection with quantum
electrodynamics. This refers to ﬁelds
ψ : R4 →Cm
with m components. For describing photons, it will be necessary to pass from
Hilbert spaces to indeﬁnite inner product spaces.

10. Creation and Annihilation Operators
The point x = (x0, x1, x2, x3) describes space and time in an inertial system, that
is, the position coordinates x1, x2, x3 are right-handed Cartesian coordinates. More-
over, we introduce the time-like coordinate
x0 := ct
where t is time, and c is the velocity of light in a vacuum. The position vector
x = x1i + x2j + x3k refers to the right-handed orthonormal system i, j, k.
The Hilbert space L2(R4n). Choose n = 1, 2, . . . Let us introduce the inner
product
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩n :=
Z
R4n ψ(x1, . . . , xn)†ϕ(x1, . . . , xn) d4x1 · · · d4xn
along with the corresponding norm ||ψ||n :=
p
⟨ψ|ψ⟩n. Hence
||ψ||2
n =
Z
R4n |ψ(x1, . . . , xn)|2 d4x1 · · · d4xn.
Here, the arguments x1, . . . , xn live in R4. By deﬁnition, the space L2(R4n) consists
of all the functions3
ψ : R4n →C
with ||ψ||n < ∞. The space L2(R4n) becomes a complex Hilbert space equipped
with the inner product ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩n. We have the direct sum decomposition
L2(R4n) = L2,sym(R4n) ⊕L2,antisym(R4n)
where the space L2,sym(R4n) (resp. L2, antisym(R4n)) contains all the functions
ψ = ψ(x1, . . . , xn),
x1, . . . , xn ∈R4
from L2(R4n) which are symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) with respect to the argu-
ments x1, . . . , xn.
Tensor products of ﬁelds. Suppose that the two functions ψ, ϕ : R4 →C
live in the Hilbert space L2(R4). Set
(ψ ⊗ϕ)(x1, x2) := ψ(x1)ϕ(x2)
for all
x1, x2 ∈R4.
Then, the tensor product ψ ⊗ϕ lives in the Hilbert space L2(R8). Introducing the
symmetrization
sym(ψ ⊗ϕ) := 1
2(ψ ⊗ϕ + ϕ ⊗ψ)
and the antisymmetrization
antisym(ψ ⊗ϕ) := 1
2(ψ ⊗ϕ −ϕ ⊗ψ) = 1
2(ψ ∧ϕ)
of the tensor product ψ ⊗ϕ, we get the decomposition
3 We tacitly assume that the functions ψ are measurable with respect to the
Lebesgue measure on R4n. This only excludes highly pathological functions
having extremely wild discontinuities. In addition, observe that two functions
ψ, ϕ : R4n →C are identiﬁed with each other if they only diﬀer on a subset of
R4n which has the 4n-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero.

10.1 The Bosonic Fock Space
773
ψ ⊗ϕ = sym(ψ ⊗ϕ) + antisym(ψ ⊗ϕ)
with sym(ψ ⊗ϕ) ∈L2,sym(R8) and antisym(ψ ⊗ϕ) ∈L2,antisym(R8). Moreover, the
set of all the ﬁnite linear combinations
α1ψ1 ⊗ϕ1 + . . . + αnψn ⊗ϕn,
n = 1, 2, . . .
with ψ1, ϕ1, . . . ∈L2(R4) and complex numbers α1, α2, . . . is dense in the Hilbert
space L2(R8). We write
L2(R8) = L2(R4) ⊗L2(R4) = L2(R4)⊗2.
This is the prototype of the tensor product of two Hilbert spaces. We also write
L2,antisym(R8) = L2(R4) ∧L2(R4) = L2(R4)∧2.
For the inner product, we have4
⟨ϕ1 ⊗ϕ2|ψ1 ⊗ψ2⟩= ⟨ϕ1|ψ1⟩⟨ϕ2|ψ2⟩.
Finally, for two given linear operators A, B : L2(R4) →L2(R4), we deﬁne the tensor
product A ⊗B by setting
(A ⊗B)(ψ ⊗ϕ) := Aψ ⊗ϕ + ψ ⊗Bϕ
for all ϕ, ψ ∈L2(R4).

Xn
of the complex Hilbert spaces X0 := C, X1 := L2(R4), and
Xn := L2,sym(R4n),
n = 2, 3, . . .
Explicitly, this means the following. The bosonic Fock space X consists of all the
inﬁnite sequences
(ψ0, ψ1, ψ2, . . .)
with P∞
n=1 ||ψn||2
n < ∞. The function ψn is called an n-particle function. Here,
• ψ0 is an arbitrary complex number,
• the one-particle functions ψ1 : R4 →C are of the form ψ1 = ψ1(x) with x ∈R4,
and they live in the complex Hilbert space L2(R4),
• the n-particle functions ψn : R4n →C,
ψn = ψn(x1, x2, . . . , xn),
n = 2, 3, . . . ,
are symmetric with respect to the n arguments x1, x2, ..., xn ∈R4, and they live
in the complex Hilbert space L2,sym(R4n).
4 Explicitly, the integral
R
(ϕ1(x1)ϕ2(x2))†ψ1(x1)ψ2(x2)d4x1d4x2 is equal to
Z
ϕ1(x1)†ψ1(x1)d4x1

10. Creation and Annihilation Operators

10.1.1 The Particle Number Operator
For ψ := (ψ0, ψ1, ψ2, ...), set

More precisely, the linear operator N : D(N) →X is deﬁned for all states ψ ∈X

For example, choose ψn ∈Xn for ﬁxed index n with ||ψn||n = 1. Deﬁne
Ψn := (0, . . . , 0, ψn, 0, 0, . . .)
where ψn stands at the nth place. Then, Ψn is a normalized state in the bosonic
Fock space X with
NΨn = nΨn.
In terms of physics, the state Ψn describes n bosons.
10.1.2 The Ground State
The state |0⟩:= (1, 0, 0, . . .) is a normalized state in the bosonic Fock space X with
N|0⟩= 0.
The state |0⟩is called the normalized vacuum state (or brieﬂy the vacuum), since
the number of bosons is equal to zero in this state.
Dense linear subspace Xﬁn of the bosonic Fock space X. Let Xﬁn denote
the set of all the states
ψ = (ψ0, ψ1, . . .)
in the bosonic Fock space X for which at most a ﬁnite number of the functions
ψ1, ψ2, . . . does not vanish identically. For example, the state
ψ = (ψ0, ψ1, . . . , ψ4, 0, 0, . . .)
with ψ0 ∈C and ψj ∈L2(R4) for j = 1, ..., 4 lies in the subspace Xﬁn.
Composition of particle functions. We are given the one-particle function

Creation operator a+(f). Fix again the one-particle function f ∈L2(R4).
We want to construct a linear operator
a+(f) : Xﬁn →X
which describes the creation of particles. Explicitly, for each sequence
ψ := (ψ0, ψ1, ψ2, . . .)
in the linear subspace Xﬁn of the bosonic Fock space X, we deﬁne
a+(f)ψ := (0, ρ1, ρ2, . . .)
(10.2)
where the functions ϱ1, ϱ2, . . . are given by (10.1). In particular,

Annihilation operator a−(f). We want to construct a linear operator

which is formally adjoint to the creation operator a+(f), that is,

for all
ϕ, ψ ∈Xﬁn.
In other words, we want to get a−(f) = (a+(f))† on Xﬁn. To this end, for each
sequence ϕ := (ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . .) in Xﬁn we deﬁne
a−(f)ϕ := (χ0, χ1, χ2, . . .)

Fundamental commutation relations. Fix f, g ∈L2(R4). Recall that
[A, B]−:= AB −BA. In particular, [A, B]−= 0 is equivalent to AB = BA.
Theorem 10.1 For all states ψ, ϕ in the linear subspace Xﬁn of the bosonic Fock
space X, the following relations hold:
(i) Creation operators: [a+(f), a+(g)]−ψ = 0.
(ii) Annihilation operators: [a−(f), a−(g)]−ψ = 0.
(iii) Creation and annihilation operators:
[a−(f), a+(g)]−ψ = ⟨f|g⟩1ψ.
(10.4)
(iv) Duality: ⟨a−(f)ϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|a+(f)ψ⟩.
Proof. To display the main ideas of the proof, we restrict ourselves to some special
cases. Then the proof of the general case proceeds similarly by induction.
Ad (i)–(iii). Choose the functions f, g ∈L2(R4) with ||f||1 = ||g||1 = 1. Since
a+(g)|0⟩= (0, g, 0, . . .), we have
a+(f)a+(g)|0⟩=
1
√
2
(0, 0, f(x1)g(x2) + f(x2)g(x1), 0, . . .).
Using symmetry, a+(f)a+(g)|0⟩−a+(g)a+(f)|0⟩= 0.
By a−(f)|0⟩= a−(g)|0⟩= 0, we get a−(f)a−(g)|0⟩−a−(g)a−(f)|0⟩= 0. Finally,
it follows from
a−(f)a+(g)|0⟩=
„Z
R4 f(x)†g(x)d4x, 0, 0, . . .
«
and a+(g)a−(f)|0⟩= 0 that
a−(f)a+(g)|0⟩−a+(g)a−(f)|0⟩= ⟨f|g⟩1|0⟩.
Ad (iv). Choosing the two special states
ψ := (0, ψ1, 0, . . .),
ϕ := (0, 0, ϕ2, 0, . . .),
we obtain
a+(f)ψ =
1
√

(0, 0, f(x1)ψ1(x2) + f(x2)ψ1(x1), 0, . . .)
and
a−(f)ϕ = (0,

Therefore, the inner product ⟨ϕ|a+(f)ψ⟩is equal to

Z
R8 ϕ2(x1, x2)†{f(x1)ψ1(x2) + f(x2)ψ1(x1)} d4x1d4x2.

Consequently, ⟨a−(f)ϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|a+(f)ψ⟩.

Physical interpretation. Choose one-particle functions f1, . . . , fs in the space
L2(R4) such that ||fj||1 = 1 for j = 1, . . . , s. Set
ψ := a+(f1)a+(f2) · · · a+(fs)|0⟩.
(10.5)
This is a state in the bosonic Fock space X. Observe that
a+(fj)|0⟩= (0, fj, 0, . . .)
and Na+(fj)|0⟩= a+(fj)|0⟩. We say that
• the function fj represents a normalized one-particle state of a boson, and
• the operator a+(fj) generates the normalized one-particle state a+(fj)|0⟩from
the vacuum |0⟩.
Note that the state ψ from (10.5) has the form (ψ0, ψ1, . . .) where ψj = 0 if j ̸= s.
Hence
Nψ = sψ.
This tells us that if ψ ̸= 0, then the state ψ from (10.5) represents s bosons being
in one-particle states corresponding to f1, . . . , fs. Because of Theorem 10.1, the
state ψ from (10.5) is invariant under permutations of f1, . . . , fs. This reﬂects the
principle of indistinguishability for s bosons.
Important special case. Consider a system of functions
f1, f2, f3, . . .
from R4 to C which forms an orthonormal system in the Hilbert space L2(R4), that
is, ⟨fk|fl⟩1 = δkl for all k, l = 1, 2, . . . Deﬁne

j := a+(fj),

j := a−(fj),
j = 1, 2, ...
For all ψ ∈Xﬁn with j, k = 1, 2, . . ., we then have the following commutation

The rigorous language of operator-valued distributions in quantum
ﬁeld theory. The space of linear operators
A : Xﬁn →X
is denoted by L(Xﬁn, X). Set6
A+(f) := a+(f)
for all
f ∈D(R4).
Then, A+ : D(R4) →L(Xﬁn, X) is a linear map from the space D(R4) of test
functions to the operator space L(Xﬁn, X). That is,
A+(αf + βg) = αA+(f) + βA+(g)
for all f, g ∈D(R4) and all complex numbers α and β. We call A+ a distribution
with values in the operator space L(Xﬁn, X). Similarly, we deﬁne
A−(f) := a−(f)
for all
f ∈D(R4).
The map A−: D(R4) →L(Xﬁn, X) is antilinear, that is,
A−(αf + βg) = α†A−(f) + β†A−(g)
6 Recall that the space D(R4) consists of all the smooth functions f : R4 →C
which vanish outside some ball, which depends on f. Such functions are called
test functions. The space D(R4) is also denoted by C∞
0 (R4).

and the duality relations

These relations are assumed to be valid for all x, y ∈R4. Intuitively, the operator
a+(x) describes the creation of a boson at the given space-time point x = (ct, x).
This corresponds to the creation of a boson at the position x at time t. Similarly,
the operator a−(x) describes the annihilation of a boson at the position x at time
t. Furthermore, we formally write
a+(f) :=

R4 f(x)a+(x)d4x,
and a−(f) :=

10.2 The Fermionic Fock Space and the Pauli Principle
In contrast to the bosonic Fock space, the components ψ2, ψ3, ... of a state in the
fermionic Fock space are not symmetric, but antisymmetric functions. As we will
see below, this forces the Pauli exclusion principle principle. Let us consider the

780
10. Creation and Annihilation Operators
prototype of a fermionic Fock space based on the one-particle function ψ : R4 →C.
The fermionic Fock space Y is deﬁned to be the direct sum
Y =
∞
M
n=0
Yn
of the complex Hilbert spaces Y0 := C, Y1 := L2(R4), and
Yn := L2, antisym(R4n),
n = 2, 3, . . .
Explicitly, the fermionic Fock space Y consists of all the inﬁnite sequences
(ψ0, ψ1, ψ2, . . .)
with P∞
n=1 ||ψn||2
n < ∞. More precisely,
• ψ0 is an arbitrary complex number,
• the one-particle functions ψ1 : R4 →C are of the form ψ1 = ψ1(x) with x ∈R4,
and they live in the complex Hilbert space L2(R4),
• the n-particle functions ψn : R4n →C,
ψn = ψn(x1, x2, . . . , xn),
n = 2, 3, . . . ,
are antisymmetric with respect to the n arguments x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈R4, and they
live in the complex Hilbert space L2,antisym(R4n).
The antisymmetry of the functions ψn reﬂects the principle of indistinguishability
for fermions. The fermionic Fock space Y is an inﬁnite-dimensional complex Hilbert
space equipped with the inner product

Recall that ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩n :=

Particle number operator N. For ψ := (ψ0, ψ1, ψ2, . . .), set
Nψ := (0, ψ1, 2ψ2, . . . , nψn, . . .).
More precisely, the linear operator N : D(N) →Y is deﬁned for all states ψ ∈Y
of the fermionic Fock space Y with
∞

n < ∞.
For example, let ψn ∈Yn for ﬁxed index n with ||ψn||n = 1. Choose
Ψn := (0, . . . , 0, ψn, 0, 0, . . .)
where ψn stands at the nth place. Then, Ψn is a normalized state in the fermionic
Fock space Y with
NΨn = nΨn.
In terms of physics, the state Ψn describes n fermions.

10.2 The Fermionic Fock Space and the Pauli Principle
781
Vacuum. The state |0⟩:= (1, 0, 0, . . .) is a normalized state in the fermionic
Fock space Y with
N|0⟩= 0.
The state |0⟩is called the normalized vacuum state (or brieﬂy vacuum), since the
number of fermions is equal to zero in this state.
Dense linear subspace Yﬁn of the fermionic Fock space Y . Let Yﬁn denote
the set of all states ψ = (ψ0, ψ1, . . .) in the fermionic Fock space Y for which at
most a ﬁnite number of the functions ψ1, ψ2, . . . does not vanish identically.
Composition of particle functions. We are given the one-particle function
f ∈L2(R4). For each n-particle function
ψn ∈L2,antisym(R4n),
the antisymmetrization of the tensor product f ⊗ψn yields the (n + 1)-particle
function
ϱn+1 :=
√
n + 1 · antisym(f ⊗ψn).
(10.8)
Intuitively, this is the composition of the one-particle state f with the n-particle
state ψn. Explicitly,
ϱn+1(x1, . . . , xn+1) =
√n + 1
(n + 1)!
X

sgn π · f(x1)ψn(x2, . . . , xn+1)
where we sum over all permutations π of the arguments x1, ..., xn+1, and sgn π
denotes the sign of the permutation π.
Creation operator b+(f). Fix again the one-particle function f ∈L2(R4).
We want to construct a linear operator
b+(f) : Yﬁn →Y
which describes the creation of particles. Explicitly, for each sequence
ψ := (ψ0, ψ1, ψ2, . . .)
in the linear subspace Yﬁn of the fermionic Fock space Y , we deﬁne
b+(f)ψ := (0, ρ1, ρ2, . . .)
(10.9)
where the functions ϱ1, ϱ2, . . . are given by (10.8). In particular, we have
ϱ1(x1) := f(x1)ψ0,
ϱ2(x1, x2) = f(x1)ψ1(x2) −f(x2)ψ1(x1)
√

Annihilation operator b−(f). We want to construct a linear operator
b−(f) : Yﬁn →Y
which is formally adjoint to the creation operator b+(f), that is,
⟨b−(f)ϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|b+(f)ψ⟩
for all
ϕ, ψ ∈Yﬁn.
In other words, we want to get b−(f) = (b+(f))† on Yﬁn. To this end, for each
sequence ϕ := (ϕ0, ϕ1, ϕ2, . . .) in Yﬁn, we deﬁne

782

b−(f)ϕ := (χ0, χ1, χ2, . . .)
(10.10)
along with

R4 f(x)†ϕn+1(x, x1, . . . , xn)d4x
for all indices n = 0, 1, 2, . . . In particular, we have

For the vacuum state, we get
b−(f)|0⟩= 0
for all
f ∈L2(R4).
Fundamental anticommutation relations. Fix f, g ∈L2(R4). Recall that
[A, B]+ := AB + BA. In particular, [A, B]+ = 0 is equivalent to the anticommuta-
tivity relation AB = −BA.
Theorem 10.2 For all states ψ, ϕ in the linear subspace Yﬁn of the fermionic Fock
space Y, the following relations hold:
(i) Creation operators: [b+(f), b+(g)]+ ψ = 0.
(ii) Annihilation operators: [b−(f), b−(g)]+ ψ = 0.
(iii) Creation and annihilation operators:
[b−(f), b+(g)]+ ψ = ⟨f|g⟩1ψ.
(10.11)
(iv) Duality: ⟨b−(f)ϕ|ψ⟩= ⟨ϕ|b+(f)ψ⟩.
Proof. Let us start with a special case. Choose functions f, g ∈L2(R4) with
||f||1 = ||g||1 = 1. Since b+(g)|0⟩= (0, g, 0, ...), we get
b+(f)b+(g)|0⟩=
1
√
2
(0, 0, f(x1)g(x2) −f(x2)g(x1), 0, . . .).
By antisymmetry, b+(f)b+(g)|0⟩+ b+(g)b+(f)|0⟩= 0.
From b−(f)|0⟩= b−(g)|0⟩= 0 we get b−(f)b−(g)|0⟩+ b−(g)b−(f)|0⟩= 0.
Finally, it follows from
b−(f)b+(g)|0⟩=
„Z
R4 f(x)†g(x)d4x, 0, 0, . . .
«
and b+(g)b−(f)|0⟩= 0 that
b−(f)b+(g)|0⟩+ b+(g)b−(f)|0⟩= ⟨f|g⟩1|0⟩.
The proof of the general case proceeds similarly by induction.

Physical interpretation. Choose functions f1, . . . , fs ∈L2(R4) with the nor-
malization condition ||fj||1 = 1 for j = 1, . . . , s. Set
ψ := b+(f1)b+(f2) · · · b+(fs)|0⟩.
(10.12)
This is a state in the fermionic Fock space Y. Observe that
b+(fj)|0⟩= (0, fj, 0, . . .)
and Nb+(fj)|0⟩= b+(fj)|0⟩. We say that

• the function fj represents a normalized one-particle state of one fermion, and
• the operator b+(fj) generates the normalized one-particle state b+(fj)|0⟩from
the vacuum state |0⟩.
In the general case, we get
Nψ = sψ.
Therefore, if ψ ̸= 0, then the state ψ from (10.12) represents s fermions which are
in one-particle states corresponding to f1, . . . , fs.
The Pauli exclusion principle. Because of Theorem 10.2 above, the state ψ
from (10.12) changes sign under odd permutations of f1, . . . , fs. Thus, we get
b+(f1)b+(f2) · · · b+(fs)|0⟩= 0
if two one-particle states fj and fk coincide. For example,
b+(f)b+(f)|0⟩= 0.
Important special case. Consider a system of functions f1, f2, f3, . . . which
form an orthonormal system in the Hilbert space L2(R4), that is,

The rigorous language of operator-valued distributions. The space of

Then, B+ : D(R4) →L(Xﬁn, X) is a linear map from the space D(R4) of test

The map B−: D(R4) →L(Yﬁn, Y ) is antilinear. We call B−an antidistribution

10.3 General Construction

x ∈R4.
We brieﬂy write ψ(x) = (ψj(x)). The desired generalization can be easily obtained
by using systematically the language of tensor products.
The one-particle Hilbert space L2(R4, Cd). To begin with, let us introduce
the following inner product:

10.3 General Construction
785
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩1 :=
Z
R4
d
X
j=1
ψj(x)†ϕj(x) d4x.
By deﬁnition, the space L2(R4, Cd) consists of all the functions ψ : R4 →Cd with
⟨ψ|ψ⟩1 < ∞.7 The space L2(R4, Cd) becomes a complex Hilbert space equipped
with the inner product ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩1.
Bosonic two-particle functions. Let ψ, ϕ ∈L2(R4, Cd) be one-particle func-
tions. The prototype of a two-particle function is the tensor product ψ ⊗ϕ. Explic-
itly, this is the tuple
(ψ ⊗ϕ)(x1, x2) := (ψi(x1)ϕj(x2))i,j=1,...,d,
x1, x2 ∈R4.
Naturally enough, the inner product is deﬁned by
⟨ψ ⊗ϕ|ψ∗⊗ϕ∗⟩2 :=

i,j=1
Ψ ij(x1, x2)†Ψ ij
∗(x1, x2) d4x1d4x2
where Ψ ij(x1, x2) := ψi(x1)ϕj(x2), and Ψ ij
∗(x1, x2) := ψi
∗(x1)ϕj
∗(x2), and
In order to get a bosonic two-particle function, we have to symmetrize. This
means that we have to pass from ψ ⊗ϕ to
sym(ψ ⊗ϕ) := 1
2(ψ ⊗ϕ + ϕ ⊗ψ).
In general, by a bosonic two-particle function we understand a tuple
Ψ(x1, x2) = (Ψ ij(x1, x2))i,j=1,...,d,
x1, x2 ∈R4,
which is symmetric with respect to both the indices i, j and the arguments x1, x2.
Explicitly, we obtain
Ψ ij(x1, x2) = Ψ ji(x2, x1),
i, j = 1, . . . , d,
x1, x2 ∈R4.
In addition, we assume that all the components Ψ ij live in the space L2(R8). We
brieﬂy write
Ψ ∈L2,sym(R8, Cd2).
In particular, for the bosonic two-particle functions Ψ, Φ ∈L2,sym(R8, Cd2), the
inner product is given by
⟨Ψ|Φ⟩2 :=

i,j=1
Ψ ij(x1, x2)†Φij(x1, x2) d4x1d4x2.
Fermionic two-particle functions. We now replace symmetry by antisymme-
try. For given one-particle functions ψ, ϕ ∈L2(R4, Cd), antisymmetrization yields
the special fermionic two-particle function
antisym(ψ ⊗ϕ) = 1
2(ψ ⊗ϕ −ϕ ⊗ψ) = 1
2(ψ ∧ϕ).
7 We tacitly assume that the components of the functions ψ are measurable with
respect to the Lebesgue measure on R4. In addition, observe that two functions
ψ, ϕ : R4 →Cd are identiﬁed with each other if they only diﬀer on a subset of
R4 which has the 4-dimensional Lebesgue measure zero.

10. Creation and Annihilation Operators
Generally, by a fermionic two-particle function we understand a tuple
Ψ(x1, x2) = (Ψ ij(x1, x2)),
i, j = 1, ..., d,
x1, x2 ∈R4
which is antisymmetric with respect to both the indices i, j and the arguments
x1, x2. Explicitly,
Ψ ij(x1, x2) = −Ψ ji(x2, x1),
i, j = 1, ..., d,
x1, x2 ∈R4.
In addition, we assume that all the components Ψ ij live in the space L2(R8). We
brieﬂy write Ψ ∈L2,antisym(R8, Cd2). Next we want to introduce

is called the bosonic Fock space to the one-particle Hilbert space L2(R4, Cd). Let
i1, . . . , in = 1, . . . , d and x1, . . . , xn ∈R4. By deﬁnition, the elements of the space
Xn are tuples
Ψ(x1, . . . , xn) = (Ψ i1...in(x1, . . . , xn))
which are symmetric with respect to both the indices i1, . . . , in = 1, . . . , n and the
n space-time variables x1, . . . , xn. Moreover, all of the components Ψ i1...in live in
the space L2(R4n). The elements of the bosonic Fock space X are inﬁnite tuples
Ψ = (Ψ0, Ψ1, . . .)
where Ψ0 is a complex number, and Ψn ∈Xn for n = 1, 2, . . . In addition, we
postulate that P∞

10.4 The Main Strategy of Quantum Electrodynamics
The most important experiments in elementary particle physics are scattering ex-
periments carried out in huge high-energy particle accelerators. Physicists charac-
terize the outcome of such experiments by cross sections. If J = ϱv is the current
density of the incoming particle stream with velocity v and particle density ϱ, then
N = σT · J
is the number of scattered particles observed during the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. In
the SI system of physical units, J has the physical dimension of particle density
times velocity, 1/m2s. Therefore, the quantity σ has the physical dimension of area,
m2, and σ is called the cross section of the scattering process. Observe the following:
• Cross sections follow from transition probabilities.
• Transition probabilities result from transition amplitudes.

10.4 The Main Strategy of Quantum Electrodynamics
789
• Transition amplitudes can be computed by using Feynman diagrams and the
corresponding Feynman rules.
Our goal is to motivate the Feynman rules in quantum electrodynamics and to
apply them to the computation of cross sections.
The Feynman rules represent the hard core of quantum ﬁeld theory.
For quantum electrodynamics, the Feynman rules will be summarized in Sect. 14.3.
Applications to scattering processes can be found in Chap. 15.
Quantum electrodynamics studies the interaction between the following parti-
cles: electrons, positrons, and photons. Here, photons represent quantized electro-
magnetic waves. Note that:
• The electron is called the basic particle of quantum electrodynamics.
• The positron is the antiparticle to the electron.
• The massless photon is responsible for the interaction between electrons and
positrons. Therefore, photons are called the interacting particles of quantum
electrodynamics.
In order to understand quantum ﬁeld theory, one has to start with quantum elec-
trodynamics. Let us discuss the main ideas of quantum electrodynamics. We will
proceed in the following four steps:
(C) Classical ﬁeld theory: We ﬁrst consider the classical principle of critical ac-
tion for the Maxwell–Dirac ﬁeld which is obtained by coupling the classical
electromagnetic ﬁeld to the Dirac ﬁeld for the relativistic electron.
(F) The free quantum ﬁeld: For the free electromagnetic ﬁeld and the free Dirac
ﬁeld of the electron, we ﬁnd solutions in the form of ﬁnite Fourier series. Re-
placing Fourier coeﬃcients by creation and annihilation operators, we get the
corresponding free quantum ﬁelds for electrons, positrons, and photons (the
method of Fourier quantization).
These free quantum ﬁelds depend on the choice of both a ﬁnite box in
position space and a ﬁnite lattice in momentum space.
(I) The interacting quantum ﬁeld: We use the interaction term between the elec-
trodynamic ﬁeld and the Dirac ﬁeld for the electron in order to formulate the
Dyson series for the S-matrix of quantum electrodynamics. The S-matrix is
a formal power series expansion with respect to the dimensionless coupling
constant in the SI system of physical units:
κ :=
√
4πα.
(10.15)
Here, α denotes the so-called ﬁne structure constant in quantum electrody-
namics:
α =
1
137.04 = 0.007297
(10.16)
which is dimensionless. In addition, −e is the negative electric charge of the
electron.8 In the SI system, we have
α =
e2
4πε0ℏc.
8 If we want to emphasize that κ and α refer to quantum electrodynamics, but
not to strong and weak interaction in the Standard Model, then we write κQED
and αQED, respectively.

790
10. Creation and Annihilation Operators
The point is that the Dyson series for the S-matrix depends nonlinearly on
the free quantum ﬁelds for electrons, positrons, and photons. Using the ap-
proximation of the S-matrix in lowest nontrivial order, we are able to compute
approximately scattering processes for electrons, positrons, and photons.
(R) Renormalization: Using higher-order approximations of the S-matrix together
with the high-energy limit (resp. the low-energy limit), we get divergent ex-
pressions for scattering processes. In order to extract physical information from
those divergent expressions, we have to use the crucial method of renormaliza-
tion. The ﬁnal results are cross sections for scattering processes of the form
σ = σ1κ + σ2κ2 + . . .
This is a power series expansion with respect to the small dimensionless cou-
pling constant κ given by (10.15). The coeﬃcients σ1, σ2, . . . are real numbers
(equipped with the physical dimension of area) coming from divergent inte-
grals by using a regularization procedure. The coincidence between theory and
physical experiment is extremely precise in quantum electrodynamics.
The smallness of the dimensionless (electromagnetic) ﬁne structure
constant α is responsible for the incredible success of perturbation the-
ory in quantum electrodynamics.
The situation changes completely in strong interaction where the coupling con-
stant is approximately equal to one, κ = 1. Then the results of perturbation
theory are only crude approximations of reality.
In string theory, there exists a duality transformation between certain models
which allows us to transform some models having large coupling constant into
dual models having small coupling constant. In the future, physicists hope to
establish such a beautiful duality method for strong interaction in nature.
Convention for the choice of the system of physical units. To simplify
notation, in the following chapters we will use the energetic system of units, that
is, we set
ℏ= c = ε0 = μ0 = k := 1.
(10.17)
Then, the dimension of an arbitrary physical quantity is some power of energy (see
the Appendix A.2 of Vol. I). In particular, the electric charge −e of the electron is
dimensionless, and we have
e =
√
4πα.
The gauge condition. It is a typical feature of quantum electrodynamics that we
do not start with the electromagnetic ﬁeld E, B, but with the four-potential U, A.
The electromagnetic ﬁeld is then given by
E = −grad U −˙A,
B = curl A.
The point is that the four-potential is only determined up to a gauge transformation
of the form
U →U −∂f
∂t ,
A →A + grad f
where f is a smooth function. This causes some trouble. We will overcome the
diﬃculties in the following sections by using the following trick:
(i) We ﬁrst destroy the gauge invariance by passing to a modiﬁed Lagrangian.
(ii) The corresponding free quantum ﬁelds include virtual photons which do not
possess an obvious physical meaning.

10.4 The Main Strategy of Quantum Electrodynamics
791
(iii) In classical theory, virtual photons are eliminated by adding the Lorenz gauge
condition.
(iv) In quantum ﬁeld theory, virtual photons are eliminated by adding a weak
Lorenz gauge condition (Gupta–Bleuler quantization).
Nevertheless, we will see that virtual photons essentially inﬂuence physical processes
proceeding in our real world. The point is that there arise terms in perturbation the-
ory which depend on the photon propagator, and this photon propagator contains
contributions coming from virtual photons. In general, quantum electrodynamics
adds new physical eﬀects to classical electrodynamics which can be summarized
under the sketch word quantum ﬂuctuations of the ground state (also called the
vacuum). In particular, this concerns the so-called vacuum polarization.

11. The Basic Equations in Quantum
Electrodynamics
Quantum electrodynamics couples the Maxwell equation for the photon to
the Dirac equation for the electron.

11.1 The Classical Lagrangian
The Einstein convention. Let us choose a ﬁxed inertial system with
x = (x0, x1, x2, x3).
Here, x = x1i + x2j + x3k is the position vector of a Cartesian coordinate system
with the right-handed orthonormal basis i, j, k. We also set x0 := t where t denotes
time. For the indices μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3, we set
η00 := 1,
η11 = η22 = η33 := −1,
ημν := 0
if μ ̸= ν
along with ημν := ημν. As usual, we use the η-symbol for lifting and lowering of
indices.
By the Einstein convention, we sum over equal lower and upper Greek
indices from 0 to 3.
For example, according to the Einstein convention we write
Aμ := ημνAν =
3

ν=0
ημνAν,
Aμ = ημνAν =

μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.

The total energy. Choose the Feynman gauge, ξ = 1. Recall that, in classical
mechanics, the energy H is given by
H := p ˙q −L
with the conjugate momentum p := L ˙q. We want to generalize this to quantum
electrodynamics. To this end, we replace q by A = (A0, A1, A2, A3) and ψ. Moreover,
we replace the time derivative ˙q by the partial time derivatives ˙A0, ˙A1, ˙A2, ˙A3 and
˙ψ. Finally, instead of p we introduce the quantities
Πμ := ∂L

μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
This motivates the following deﬁnition of the energy density:

μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Moreover, it follows from ψ = ψ†γ0 and (γ0)2 = I that
L = iψγ0∂0ψ + . . . = iψ† ˙ψ + . . .
Hence π = ∂L
∂˙ψ = iψ†.

Next we want to study the relation between the solutions of the Euler–Lagrange
equations from Theorem 11.1 and the electromagnetic ﬁeld.
11.2 The Gauge Condition
The Danish physicist Ludvig Valentin Lorenz (1829–1891) is perhaps best
known for his pairing with the more famous Dutch physicist Hendrik An-
toon Lorentz (1853–1928) in the Lorenz–Lorentz relation between index of
refraction and density. In fact, Lorenz was a pioneer in the theory of light
and in electrodynamics, contemporaneous with Maxwell (1831–1879). In
1862 he developed a mathematical theory of light, using the basic known
facts (transversality of vibrations, Fresnel’s law), but avoiding the (un-
necessary to him) physical modelling of a mechanistic ether in favor of a
purely phenomenological model.2 . . .

Lorenz proposed the condition (11.6) below in the mid-1860s, but this
constraint is generally misattributed to the better known Lorentz.3

(11.8)

Proof. Because of the Lorenz gauge condition, we get
2Aμ = Jμ
QED,
μ = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Again by the Lorenz gauge condition, we have
∂μF μν = ∂μ(∂μAν −∂νAμ) = 2Aν −∂ν(∂μAμ) = 2Aν = Jν
QED.
The equation ∂αFβγ + ∂βFγα + ∂γFαβ = 0 follows easily from (11.7).

Summarizing, the solutions of the Euler–Lagrange equations from Theorem 11.1 on
page 795 do not always possess a physical meaning, since the Maxwell equations
are violated. This situation changes if we add the Lorenz gauge condition. Then we
obtain an electromagnetic ﬁeld which satisﬁes the Maxwell equations.
Relativistic invariance. In this chapter, the basic equations of quantum elec-
trodynamics were formulated in a ﬁxed inertial system. It remains to show that
these equations have the same form in any inertial system. From the mathemat-
ical point of view, we have to indicate the transformation laws for the physical
quantities under a change of the inertial system via a Poincar´e transformation, and
we have to show the invariance of the basic equations of quantum electrodynam-
ics under the Poincar´e group. This will be thoroughly studied in Vol. III by using
both classical tensor analysis (including van der Waerden’s spinor calculus) and
Cartan’s exterior calculus of diﬀerential forms (including K¨ahler’s interior calculus
of diﬀerential forms).

12. The Free Quantum Field of Electrons,
Positrons, and Photons
Quantum ﬁelds possess an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. However,
in order to overcome serious diﬃculties, it is wise to start with a ﬁnite
number of degrees of freedom and to study the lattice limit (continuum
limit) for such quantities which can be measured in physical experiments.
Folklore
12.1 Classical Free Fields
For vanishing coupling constant, κQED = 0 (free ﬁelds), we want to consider solu-
tions of the classical ﬁeld equations in the form of a ﬁnite Fourier series.
Plane electromagnetic waves. Let ωp := |p|. For the ﬁeld
U(x, t) := U0eipx e−iωpt,
A(x, t) := A0eipx e−iωpt,
(12.1)
the following are true.
(W) Wave equations: 2U = 0 and 2A = 0 on R4.
(G) Lorenz gauge condition: If ωpU0 = pA0, then
˙U + div A = 0
on
R4.
In fact, this implies ΔU = −Uxx −Uyy −Uzz = p2U. Hence
2U = ¨U + ΔU = (−ω2
p + p2)U = 0.
The statements (W) and (G) remain true if we replace U, A by the conjugate-
complex ﬁelds U †, A†. Explicitly,
U(x, t)† := U †
0e−ipx eiωpt,
A(x, t)† := A†
0e−ipx eiωpt.
Our next goal is to consider ﬁnite sums of such plane wave solutions. To this end,
we need some preparations.
12.1.1 The Lattice Strategy in Quantum Electrodynamics
Our basic strategy reads as follows:
(i) Periodicity of free ﬁelds: Classical free ﬁelds are represented by ﬁnite Fourier
series. To this end, we put the free ﬁelds of photons and electrons in a box of
length L and volume V := L3, and we assume that the ﬁelds have the period
L with respect to the position variables. Moreover, we introduce a lattice in
momentum space. This yields ﬁnite Fourier series.

12. The Free Quantum Fields of Electrons, Positrons, and Photons
(ii) The crucial method of Fourier quantization:
We replace the Fourier coeﬃcients of the ﬁnite Fourier series by cre-
ation and annihilation operators.
The advantage of this construction is the fact that a ﬁxed ﬁnite number of
creation and annihilation operators can be uniquely realized, up to unitary
equivalence. For bosons (i.e., photons), this follows from the Stone–von Neu-
mann theorem on the realization of a ﬁnite number of commutation relations
(see Sect. 7.16).1
(iii) The Dyson series for the S-matrix: Concerning a ﬁnite number of creation and
annihilation operators, the S-matrix is a well-deﬁned ﬁnite series in each order
of perturbation theory. This leads to well-deﬁned discrete Feynman propagators
in the form of discrete integrals (i.e., ﬁnite sums) (see Chap. 13).
(iv) Feynman rules: The Wick theorem provides us with well-deﬁned discrete in-
tegrals. This way, for example, we get well-deﬁned cross sections in each order
of perturbation theory.
(v) Continuum limit for the cross sections: Finally, we have to carry out the delicate
limit
L →+∞,
that is, the period L goes to inﬁnity. As a typical example, we will study this
limit for the cross section of Compton scattering in order to get the Klein–
Nishina formula (see Sects. 14.4 and 15.1).
(vi) Renormalization: In general, that is, in higher order of perturbation theory,
an immediate computation of the continuum limit is not possible, since the
corresponding limit integrals are divergent. Therefore, we have to apply the
procedure of renormalization theory (see Chap. 16).
(vii) Relativistic invariance: The choice of the lattice in momentum space destroys
the relativistic invariance of the approach. Therefore, we have to check that the
ﬁnal cross sections are relativistically invariant, that is, the ﬁnal formulas for
the cross sections do not depend on the choice of the inertial system. Roughly
speaking, this can be ensured by using discrete formulas which are obtained
by discretizing relativistically invariant formulas. We will proceed this way.
(viii) Gauge invariance: Our computations will be based on a ﬁxed choice of the
gauge condition for the four-potential of the electromagnetic ﬁeld. A perfect
theory has to show that the physically relevant quantities measured in physical
experiments (e.g., the cross section) are gauge invariant, that is, they do not
depend on the choice of the gauge condition. We will come back to this problem
in later volumes in connection with the study of the Standard Model in particle
physics.
Our mathematical language will be close to the language used by physicists. To
this end, we will use the discrete Dirac calculus introduced in Sect. 12.1 of Vol. I.
Let us recall some basic deﬁnitions.
The normalization volume V. Choose a ﬁxed inertial system. The point
x = (x0, x1, x2, x3) describes space and time in the inertial system. That is, the

position coordinates x1, x2, x3 are right-handed Cartesian coordinates.2 Moreover,
we introduce the time coordinate x0 := t. The position vector
x = x1i + x2j + x3k
refers to the right-handed orthonormal system i, j, k. The same is true for the
momentum vector
p = p1i + p2j + p3k.
We ﬁx the length parameter L > 0, and we introduce the cube
C(L) :=
˘
(x1, x2, x3) ∈R3 :
−L

(12.2)
of side length L. The volume of the cube, V := L3, is called the normalization
volume.
The truncated lattice G(N) in momentum space. Fix the natural number
N = 1, 2, . . . Let m1, m2, m3 be integers. By deﬁnition, the symbol G(N) denotes
the set of all lattice momentum vectors
p := 2π
L · (m1i + m2j + m3k)
with |mj| ≤N, j = 1, 2, 3. Moreover, we set
Δ3p := Δp1Δp2Δp3,
Δpj := 2π
L ,
j = 1, 2, 3.
The crucial limit
L →+∞,
N →+∞
sends the truncated grid G(N) to R3. Therefore, we call this the continuum limit.
Discrete Fourier series. For given complex numbers ap, the function
f(x) :=

for all position vectors x and y. This is called the discrete Dirac delta function in
position space. To simplify notation, we do not indicate that δC(L) also depends on
N (the size of the grid G(N) in momentum space). For each function f of the form
(12.3), we obtain the following integral formula:
2 By our general convention (10.17) for the choice of the physical units, we set
c = 1 and ℏ= 1.

The classical limit. Fix the position vector y.

C(L)
δC(L)(y −x) ϕ(x) d3x := ϕ(y).

Z
C(L)
δC(L)(y −x) ϕ(x) d3x :=
Z
R3 δC(L)(y −x) ϕ(x) d3x
if L is suﬃciently large. Since the function ϕ lives in the space S(R3) of rapidly
decreasing smooth functions at inﬁnity, the same is true for the classical Fourier
transform ˆϕ of ϕ. By Fourier transformation, we get
Z
R3 δC(L)(y −x)ϕ(x)d3x =

The key relation (12.5) tells us that, for ﬁxed position vector y, we have

in the sense of the distribution space D′(R3).
The generalized limit in scattering theory. Again ﬁx the position vector

limit:

Z
C(L)
δC(L)(y −x) ϕ(x) d3x := ϕ(y).
(12.6)
This deﬁnition is motivated by Prop. 12.1. Mnemonically, in the spirit of physicists,
we use the following formal argument: L →+∞implies Δ3p →0. Hence
lim
N→∞
lim
L→+∞δC(L)(y −x) =

(2π)3
Z
R3 ei(y−x)d3p = δ(y −x).
Note that the Dirac delta function is even, that is, δ(y −x) = δ(x −x). Therefore,

lim
L→+∞
Z
C(L)
δC(L)(y −x)ϕ(x) d3x =
Z
R3 δ(y −x)ϕ(x)d3x = ϕ(y).
This is the key formula (12.6).
We will use similar arguments for computing the following physical eﬀects in
Chap. 15 via the continuum limit L →+∞and N →+∞:
• the Klein–Nishina cross section formula for Compton scattering,
• the cross section for Cherenkov scattering,
• the scattering of electrons in the Yukawa potential,
• the scattering of electrons in the Coulomb potential,
• the emission rate formula for the spontaneous emission of photons by atoms, and
• the Heisenberg radiation formula for the intensity of spectral lines of atoms.
In physics, one uses the following terminology:
• The limit N →+∞is called the large-momenta limit (or the high-energy limit).
• The limit L →+∞(i.e., the normalization volume V goes to inﬁnity) is called
the small-momenta limit, Δp →0 (or the low-energy limit).
This will be studied in Chap 16.
12.1.3 The Free Electromagnetic Field
Let us start with the special free electromagnetic ﬁeld (12.1) on page 799. Our goal
is to use the superposition principle in order to construct more general free ﬁelds in
the form of ﬁnite Fourier series. To this end, for given momentum vector p, choose
three vectors
e3(p) := p
|p|,
e1(p),
e2(p)
which form a right-handed orthonormal system (Fig. 12.1). Fix N = 1, 2, . . ., and

in order to simplify the formulas of quantized free ﬁelds to be considered in Sect.
12.2.1. For p = 0, we set N0 := 0.
Theorem 12.2 The ﬁeld U, A satisﬁes the wave equations
2U = 0,
2A = 0
on
R4.
If ap,0 = ap,3 for all momentum vectors p ∈G(N), then the Lorenz gauge condition
˙U + div A = 0 is satisﬁed on R4.
Proof. Concerning the Lorenz gauge condition, note that
∂
∂t ei(px−ωpt) = −iωp ei(px−ωpt),
divx es(p)ei(px−ωpt) = ies(p)p ei(px−ωpt)
along with e3(p)p = |p| = ωp, and e1(p)p = e2(p)p = 0.

(12.8)
The importance of virtual photons. The index s indicates the polarization
of the ﬁeld A0, A1, A2, A3. We have to distinguish the following three cases.
• For s = 1, 2, the ﬁeld A is transversal to the direction p of the propagation of
the plane wave (Fig. 12.1). Therefore, we speak of transversal polarization. For
s = 3, the ﬁeld A is parallel to the direction p of the propagation of the plane
wave. We speak of longitudinal polarization.
• For s = 0, we speak of scalar polarization.
After quantization to be carried out below, plane electromagnetic waves pass over
to photons (i.e, light particles).
Transversal (resp. longitudinal, scalar) polarization will then correspond to
transversal (resp. longitudinal, scalar) photons.
Longitudinal and scalar photons are also called virtual photons. Observe that vir-
tual photons are nonphysical objects. They have to be eliminated by the Gupta–
Bleuler procedure which will be considered in Sect. 12.4.4 on page 831.
The introduction of virtual physical states, also called ghosts, is typical for
the quantization of gauge ﬁeld theories like quantum electrodynamics and
the more general Standard Model in particle physics.
Note that this is more than a mathematical trick. It will be shown below that
• virtual particles do never appear as incoming and outgoing particles in scattering
processes;
• nevertheless, virtual particles are responsible for real physical eﬀects in quantum
ﬁeld theory via quantum ﬂuctuations.
Mathematically, this depends on the fact that virtual particles contribute to the
Feynman propagators which govern the computations of physical eﬀects in pertur-
bation theory (see Sect. 13.4.1). Intuitively, virtual particles correspond to internal
lines of Feynman diagrams (see Chap. 14).

Plane wave solutions of the Dirac equation for the free electron. The

all momentum vectors p, q, and all spin numbers r, s = ± 1

Physical properties of plane electron waves. Consider ﬁrst the wave func-
tion
ψ+
p,s(x, t) = up,seipxe−iEpt,
s = ± 1
2.
The physics of plane electron waves can be described in terms of the following four
operators:
(M) Momentum operator: P := −i∂.
(E) Energy operator: H = meγ0 + γ0γP.
(S) Spin operator: S = S1i + S2j + S3k. Here,
Sj := 1
2
 
σj 0
0 σj
!
,
j = 1, 2, 3.
(H) Helicity operator (spin projection): For nonzero momentum vector p, we deﬁne
the helicity operator in direction of p by
Sp := pS
|p| =
1
2|p|
 
pσ
0
0 pσ
!
.
Using the Dirac–Pauli matrices, we set
σαβ := i
2[γα, γβ]−,
α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Then, S1 = 1
2σ23, S2 = 1
2σ31, and S3 = 1
2σ12. Note that
Pψ+
p,s = pψ+
p,s,
Hψ+
p,s = Epψ+
p,s,
s = ± 1
2.
In terms of physics, the ﬁeld ψ+
p,s possesses the momentum vector p and the energy
Ep. For example, suppose that the momentum vector p points in direction of the
z-axis, that is, p = p3k with p3 > 0. Then
Sψ+
p,s = (sk)ψ+
p,s,
Spψ+
p,s = sψ+
p,s,
s = ± 1
2.
We say that the electron state ψ+
p,s with p = p3k, p3 > 0 has the spin vector sk and
the helicity s. For s = 1
2 (resp. s = −1
2) we speak of a spin-up (resp. spin-down)
state.
The trouble with negative energies. Consider now the wave function
ψ−
p,s(x, t) = vp,se−ipxeiEpt.
From the mathematical point of view, this is a solution of the Dirac equation
i ˙ψ = Hψ with
Pψ−
p,s = −pψ−
p,s,
Hψ−
p,s = −Epψ−
p,s,

Suppose that the momentum vector p points in direction of the z-axis, i.e., p = p3k
with p3 > 0. Then
Sψ−

p,s,
Spψ−
p,s = −sψ−
p,s,
s = ± 1
2.

12.1 Classical Free Fields
809
From the physical point of view, we encounter the trouble that because of
Hψ−
p,s = −Epψ−
p,s,
the function ψ−
p,s corresponds to the negative energy −Ep. In 1928, Dirac did over-
come this diﬃculty by postulating that there exists an antiparticle to the electron
which is called the positron nowadays.
The function ψ−
p,s corresponds to a positron of positive energy Ep and
momentum vector p.
In the case where p = p3k with p3 > 0, the function ψ−
p,s describes a positron of
spin vector sk and helicity s with s = ± 1
2. In the 1940s, Stueckelberg (1905–1984)
emphasized the following point of view:
The positron is an electron running backwards in time.
This refers to the following mathematical fact. For given positron function ψ−
p,s,
deﬁne
ψ(x, t) := ψ−
p,s(x, −t),
t ∈R.
Then, the function ψ is a solution of the Dirac equation i ˙ψ = Hψ along with
Hψ = Epψ,
Pψ = −pψ.
In the case where p = p3k with p3 > 0, we get
Sψ = (−sk)ψ,
Spψ = −sψ.
The passage p →−p and s →−s is motivated by the fact that under the time
reﬂection t →−t, the velocity vector changes sign, and hence both the momentum
vector p and the angular momentum vector (spin) a of a classical particle change
sign, i.e., p →−p and a →−a. On the classical level, the approach to positrons
sounds artiﬁcially. The natural setting for positrons is the passage to quantum ﬁeld
theory via creation and annihilation operators. This will be studied in Sect. 12.2.1
on page 812.

• the function ψ has the period L with respect to the variables x1, x2, x3;

• two functions ψ and ϕ in L2, per(C(L), C4) are identiﬁed with each other iﬀthey
diﬀer on a subset of Lebesgue measure zero on R3.
The space L2, per(C(L), C4) is a complex Hilbert space with respect to the inner
product ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩C(L).

L2, per(C(L), C4) with the normalization condition

⟨ψ±
p,r|ψ∓
q,s⟩C(L) = 0

Proof. This follows by using an explicit computation based on the orthogonality

Alternatively, we can use the following standard argument from functional anal-
ysis. Let ψ, ϕ ∈L2, per(C(L), C4) be smooth functions. Observing the periodicity of
ψ and ϕ, integration by parts yields
Z
C(L)
ψ(x)†∂jϕ(x)d3x = −
Z
C(L)
∂jψ(x)†ϕ(x)d3x
for j = 1, 2, 3. Hence
⟨ψ|Hϕ⟩C(L) = ⟨Hψ|ϕ⟩C(L).
This shows that the diﬀerential operator H is formally self-adjoint on the set of
smooth functions in the Hilbert space L2, per(C(L), C4). Consequently, the eigen-
functions of the operator H with respect to diﬀerent eigenvalues are orthogonal to
each other. Finally, note that Hψ±
p,s = ±Epψ±

After quantization, the ﬁelds ψ and ψ will describe free electrons and positrons.
12.2 Quantization
Quantization is not a handicraft, but an art.
Folklore
We now use the method of Fourier quantization in order to describe free quantum
ﬁelds of photons, electrons, and positrons which are the basic particles in quantum
electrodynamics. The idea is to consider
• the Maxwell equations in classical electrodynamics with vanishing external elec-
tric charge density and vanishing electric current, and
• the Dirac equation for the classical relativistic electron with vanishing external
electromagnetic ﬁeld.
It turns out that there exist solutions in the form of Fourier series. The correspond-
ing free quantum ﬁelds are then obtained by replacing
• the Fourier coeﬃcients ap by annihilation operators a−
p , and
• the conjugate-complex Fourier coeﬃcients a†
p by creation operators a+
p .
The normalization factors are chosen in such a way that we obtain the appropriate
expression for the energy operator. The classical free ﬁelds concern plane electro-
magnetic waves and plane waves for the classical relativistic electron.
The procedure of Fourier quantization leads quite naturally to the antipar-
ticle of the electron called positron.
The existence of the positron was conjectured by Dirac in 1928. Experimentally,
the positron was discovered in cosmic rays by Anderson in 1932.
As we will show in Chap. 13 on the Dyson series for the S-matrix, the
knowledge of the free quantum ﬁelds for photons, electrons, and positrons
is basic for computing the interaction between photons, electrons, and
positrons in terms of perturbation theory.
Observe the following peculiarity. In order to simplify the approach, we ﬁrst include
photons which violate the Lorenz gauge condition. In Sect. 12.4.4, we will add the
Gupta–Bleuler quantization condition,
a−
p,0|Ψ⟩= 0,
a−
p,3|Ψ⟩= 0,
for characterizing physical states Ψ. This condition eliminates nonphysical photons
which do not possess transversal polarization. The Gupta–Bleuler method is the
prototype for the quantization of gauge theories by eliminating nonphysical quan-
tum states via the BRST quantization methods based on cohomology.

12.2.1 The Free Photon Quantum Field
Fix N = 1, 2, 3, . . . Let μ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Motivated by the free electromagnetic ﬁeld
in Sect. 12.1.3 on page 805, we deﬁne the free quantum ﬁelds of photons in the
following way:
Aμ(x, t) :=
X
p∈G(N)
3
X
s=0
(a−
p,s ei(px−ωpt) + a+
p,s e−i(px−ωpt)) Npeμ
s (p)
along with the following normalization factor
Np :=
s
1
2L3ωp
for all
p ̸= 0.
For p = 0, we set N0 := 0. We postulate that for all given lattice momentum vectors
p, q ∈G(N) and all polarization indices s, r = 0, 1, 2, 3,
• the photon creation operators a+
p,s, and
• the photon annihilation operators a−
p,s
satisfy the following commutation relations which will be used frequently:6
(P1) [a−
p,s, a+
p,s]−= I if s = 1, 2, 3.
(P2) [a−
p,0, a+
p,0]−= −I.
(P3) [a−
p,s, a+
q,r]−= 0 if p ̸= q or s ̸= r.
(P4) [a−
p,s, a−
q,r]−= [a+
p,s, a+
q,r]−= 0.
(P5) a−
p,s|0⟩= 0.
(P6) (a−
p,s)† = a+
p,s.
To motivate these commutation relations, we will show next that (P1)–(P6) imply
• reasonable commutation relations for the free quantum ﬁeld Aμ of photons and
its conjugate ﬁeld Πμ = −˙Aμ, and
• a reasonable expression for the energy operator.
The crucial realization of the commutation relations (P1)–(P6) will be studied in
Sect. 12.4.3 on page 826. Note the following:
• The polarization index s = 1, 2 corresponds to transversal photons.
• The polarization index s = 0 (resp. s = 3) corresponds to scalar (resp. longitu-
dinal photons.
Transversal photons are called real photons (or physical photons). Both scalar and
longitudinal physical photons are called virtual photons (or unphysical photons).
The canonical commutation relations for the free quantum ﬁeld of
photons. Fix time t. For μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3 and all position vectors x and y, we
obtain
[Aμ(x, t), Πν(y, t)]−= iδC(L)(x −y) · ημνI
(12.13)
and
[Aμ(x, t), Aν(y, t)]−= 0,
[Πμ(x, t), Πν(y, t)]−= 0.
(12.14)
6 Recall that [A, B]−:= AB −BA.

12.2 Quantization
813
Naturally enough, the commutation relations (12.13) for the free quantum ﬁeld Aμ
of photons and its conjugate ﬁeld Πμ = −˙Aμ generalize the Heisenberg commuta-
tion relation
[q, p]−= iI
for position q and and the conjugate momentum p in quantum mechanics. Observe
the crucial fact that the appearance of the symbol ημν guarantees the appropriate
behavior under Lorentz transformations (relativistic invariance). In order to obtain
the symbol ημν, but not δμν, we postulate diﬀerent signs for the commutation
relations in (P1) and (P2) above.
Proof. Let us prove (12.13). The key is the completeness relation

s = 0, 1, 2, 3, we obtain the following equation:

The positron is the antiparticle to the electron. The positron has the same mass as

positron has the positive electric charge e.8
The quantum ﬁeld of free electrons and positrons. Consider now the
classical solution ψ of the free Dirac equation from (12.11) on page 810.
• Replace the Fourier coeﬃcient bp,s by the annihilation operator b−
p,s of an electron
with momentum vector p and spin s = ± 1
2 in direction of p.9
• Replace the Fourier coeﬃcient cp,s by the annihilation operator c−
p,s of a positron
with momentum vector p and spin s = ± 1
2 in direction of p.
• Replace the conjugate-complex Fourier coeﬃcient b†
p,s by the creation operator

2 in direction of p.
• Replace the conjugate-complex Fourier coeﬃcient c†
p,s by the creation operator
c+
p,s of a positron with momentum vector p and spin s = ± 1

This way, from (12.11) we get the following free electron-positron quantum ﬁeld

The anticommutation relations for the electron. For the creation and
annihilation operators of a free electron we postulate the following anticommutation
relations for all p, q ∈G(N) and all s, r = ± 1

(E1) [b−
p,s, b+

energy (resp. the positron energy) is given by
Ep :=

and the photon energy is given by Ephot := ℏωp.

The anticommutation relations for the positron. Similarly, for the cre-

(E+2) [c−

Since photons, electrons, and positrons are independent particles, we assume that
the corresponding creation and annihilation operators always commute. Explicitly,
we postulate that for all momentum vectors p, q ∈G(N) and all polarizations
s = 0, 1, 2, 3 and r, r′ = ± 1
2, the following are true:
(F1) [a±

(F3) [b±

The realization of the anticommutation relations (E1)–(E5) and (E+1)–(E+5) for
electrons and positrons along with (F1)–(F3) will be discussed in Sect. 12.4.3 on
page 826.
The canonical anticommutation relations for the free quantum ﬁeld
of electrons and positrons. Fix time t. For j, k = 1, ..., 4 and all position vectors
x and y, we obtain
[ψj(x, t), πk(y, t)]+ = iδC(L)(x −y) · δjkI
(12.18)
and
[ψj(x, t), ψk(y, t)]+ = 0,
[πj(x, t), πk(y, t)]+ = 0.
(12.19)
Here, π = L ˙ψ = iψ† denotes the conjugate ﬁeld to ψ. Using the anticommutation
relations for the creation and annihilation operators b±, c±, this follows analogously
as in the proof of (12.13) on page 812.

The total energy operator of free quantum ﬁelds in quantum electro-
dynamics. Using the superposition principle, we deﬁne the total energy operator
of the free quantum ﬁeld in quantum electrodynamics by
Hfree := Hphot + Hel + Hpos.
(12.21)
For further investigations, it is useful to separate the vacuum energy. To this end,
we redeﬁne Hphot, Hel, Hpos by setting
Hfree := Hphot + Hel + Hpos + Hvac.
Here, we deﬁne the photon energy operator
Hphot := Hreal photons + Hvirtual photons

we assume that

This negative energy −Eq of the positron is a nonphysical result. Summarizing,
positivity of energy forces the anticommutation relations for electrons and positrons.
In Sect. 10.2 on page 779, we have shown that anticommutation relations in the
Fock space are responsible for the Pauli exclusion principle. Pauli formulated the
following general spin-statistics principle for quantum ﬁelds in 1955:11
• Particles with integer spin (bosons) have to be quantized by commutation rela-
tions. The number of identical bosons in a ﬁxed physical state is unlimited.
• Particles with half-integer spin (fermions) have to be quantized by anticommu-
tation relations. Two identical fermions cannot be in the same physical state.
In terms of statistical physics, one has to use
• the Bose–Einstein statistics for bosons (e.g., photons), and
• the Fermi–Dirac statistics for fermions (e.g., electrons and positrons).

12.2.3 The Spin of Photons
The spin of elementary particles is related to inﬁnitesimal rotations.
Folklore
Classical electromagnetic waves possess a polarization. Motivated by the electron
spin, we want to reformulate this by introducing the photon spin.
Inﬁnitesimal rotation. Consider a rotation
x′ = Ux,
x ∈V3,
about the origin in the 3-dimensional Euclidean vector space V3.12 In particular,
consider a right-handed (x, y, z)-Cartesian coordinate with the right-handed or-
thonormal basis i, j, k. The position vector reads as
x = xi + yj + zk.
Let n = n1i + n2j + n3k be a unit vector. The symbol Un(ϕ) denotes a counter-
clockwise rotation about the axis n of the angle ϕ. In particular, Uk(ϕ) represents
a rotation about the z-axis. For small angle ϕ, we have the approximation formula
Un(ϕ)x = x + ϕ(n × x) + O(ϕ2),
ϕ →0.
Set Inx := n × x. The operator In is called an inﬁnitesimal rotation about the axis
n. Each rotation U induces the following transformation TU :
(i) Schr¨odinger’s wave function: TUψ(x) = ψ(U −1x).
(ii) Photon wave function: TUA(x) := UA(U −1x).
11 W. Pauli, On the connection between spin and statistics, Progr. Theor. Phys. 5
(1955), 526–543.
12 All of these rotations form a group called the special unitary group, SU(V3), of
the space V3.

820
12. The Free Quantum Fields of Electrons, Positrons, and Photons
(iii) Electron wave function: TUψ(x) = TUψ(U −1x).
Naturally enough, we postulate that the operator TU possesses the following product
property TUTV = TUV for all U, V ∈SU(V3). Concerning (i)–(iii), this implies13
TUV = TUTV
for all
U, V ∈SU(V3).
We say that the family of operators {TU} forms a representation of the group
SU(V3).
Angular momentum of the Schr¨odinger wave function. Consider ﬁrst
the case (i) above. For smooth functions ψ, deﬁne the operator In by the following
approximation formula
TUn(ϕ)ψ(x) = ψ(x) + ϕInψ(x) + O(ϕ2),
ϕ →0.
The Taylor formula tells us that
In = n(x × ∂).
Explicitly, Inψ(x) = n(x × ∂ψ(x)). To prove this, consider ﬁrst the special case
where n := k. Then, up to terms of order O(ϕ2) as ϕ →0, we get
Uk(ϕ)−1x = Uk(−ϕ)x = x −ϕ · (k × x) + . . . = x + ϕ · (yi −xj) + . . .
This implies
ψ(Uk(ϕ)−1x) = ψ(x) + ϕ · (yψx(x) −xψy(x)) + . . .
Hence Ikψ(x) = k(x × ∂ψ(x)). The case for general unit vectors n proceeds simi-
larly. Using the inﬁnitesimal operator In, we deﬁne the angular momentum operator
Ln in direction of the unit vector n by setting
Ln := −iIn.
Specializing n = i, j, k, we deﬁne
L1 := −iIi,
L2 := −iIj,
L3 := −iIk = i(y∂x −x∂y).
Thus, for the operator L := L1i + L2j + L3k, we get14
L = −i(x × ∂).
Explicitly, Lψ(x) = −i(x × ∂ψ(x)). This is the angular momentum operator in
quantum mechanics.
Spin of the photon wave function. Consider now the case (ii) above. Up to
terms of order O(ϕ2) as ϕ →0, we get
13 For example, consider (iii). Then
(TUV ψ)(x) = TUV ψ((UV )−1x) = TUTV ψ(U −1V −1x) = TU(TV ψ)(x).
14 Recall that we work in the energetic system. In the SI system, Ln := −iℏIn.
Hence L := −iℏ(x × ∂).

12.2 Quantization
821
TUn(ϕ)A(x) = A(x′) + ϕ · n × A(x′) + . . .
with x′ = x −ϕ · (n × x) + . . . Hence
TUn(ϕ)A(x) = A(x) + ϕInA(x) + O(ϕ2),
ϕ →0
with the inﬁnitesimal operator
InA(x) := n × A(x) + LnA(x).
We now introduce the total angular momentum operator15
Jn := −iIn
in direction of the unit vector n. Note that we obtain the decomposition
Jn = Sn + Ln.
(12.25)
Here, the operator Ln = n(x×∂) is called the orbital angular momentum operator,
and the operator Sn given by
SnA := −i(n × A)
is called the spin operator of the vector ﬁeld A in direction of n. For given nonzero
momentum vector p, introduce the unit vector n := p/|p|. Choose the three vectors
e1(p),
e2(p),
e3(p) := n
in such a way that they form a right-handed orthonormal system. Then, the vectors
e±(p) := e1(p) ∓ie2(p)
√
2
are eigenvectors of the spin operator Sn. Explicitly,16
Sne±(p) = ±e±(p).
Therefore, we assign the spin s = ±1 to the vector e±(p), respectively. Let ap,± be
complex numbers. For the following photon wave functions
A±(x, t) := ap,±(p) e±(p) e±i(px−Ept),
we get the wave equation 2A = 0 and
SnA± = ±A±.
We say that the photon wave function A± has the spin s = ±1 in direction of the
momentum vector p, respectively.
Spin of the electron wave function. Consider the case (iii) above. Let
U := Un(ϕ). According to the representation theory for the Lorentz group, we
get17
15 In the SI system of units, Jn := −iℏIn and SnA := −iℏ(n × A).
16 Note that n × (e1 + ie2) = e2 −ie1.
17 The representation theory of the Lorentz group will be thoroughly studied in
Vol. III.

The remaining operators S1, S2 are obtained from this by using the cyclic permu-
tation 1 →2 →3 →1. Therefore,
TUψ(x) = ψ(x) + Inψ(x) + O(ϕ2),
ϕ →0
with In = i(nS + Ln). Similarly as in (12.25) above, we introduce the total angular
momentum operator Jn = −iIn. Hence
Jn = nS + Ln.
The operator Sn (resp. Ln) is called the spin operator (resp. the orbital angular
momentum operator) of the electron.
Perspectives in representation theory. We will show in Vol. III that the
irreducible representations of the rotation group SU(V3) can be classiﬁed by a
number s = 0, 1
2, 1, 3
2, 2, ... For the rotation group SU(V3) itself, we get s = 1. Each
elementary particle corresponds to such an irreducible representation of SU(V3). In
particular, the following are true:
• s = 0: gluons, mesons π+, π0, π−;
• s = 1
2: electron, positron, neutrinos, muon, tau, quarks, proton, neutron;
• s = 1: photon, vector bosons W +, W −, Z0;
• s = 2: graviton.
The number s is called the spin number of the elementary particle. For given spin
number s and given unit vector n, there always exist states of the elementary
particle where the spin attains either the value s or −s in direction of the vector
n.18
The spin quantum number is the prototype for the mathematical construction of
quantum numbers in elementary particle physics. This will be thoroughly studied
in Vols. IIIﬀ. For example, the group SU(3) is responsible for the fact that the
proton consists of three quarks. Moreover, mesons are quark-antiquark pairs. The
representation theory of the compact Lie group SU(3) due to Hermann Weyl helps
to classify the possible reactions between elementary particles.
12.3 The Ground State Energy and the Normal Product
In formal terms, the ground state energy (vacuum energy) of the electro-
magnetic quantum ﬁeld is inﬁnite. This causes mathematical trouble in
quantum electrodynamics.
Folklore
It is typical for quantum ﬁeld theory that the ground state of a quantum ﬁeld
has nonzero energy. This so-called vacuum energy is responsible for physical eﬀects
which can be measured in physical experiments. The prototype for such a vacuum
eﬀect is the Casimir eﬀect considered in Sect. 2.23.1 of Vol. I.
18 In the SI system, the values are sℏand −sℏ.

12.3 The Ground State Energy and the Normal Product
823
From the mathematical point of view, the vacuum energy is a nontrivial
phenomenon related to inﬁnities.
This can be seen by increasing the number of grid points N. In fact, it follows from
(12.22) that
lim
N→∞Hvac = −∞.
Therefore, the vacuum energy becomes inﬁnite in the continuum limit. In quantum
electrodynamics, the simplest method is to ignore the vacuum term Hvac by using
normal products of creation and annihilation operators. Let us discuss this.
The normal product of creation and annihilation operators. For photon
creation and annihilation operators, we deﬁne the so-called normal product by
setting
: a−
p,sa+
q,r : = a+
q,ra−
p,s
along with the following additional conventions:
• : a+
p,sa−
q,r : = a+
p,sa−
q,r,
• : a+
p,sa+
q,r : = a+
p,sa+
q,r,
• : a−
p,sa−
q,r : = a−
p,sa−
q,r.
Mnemonically, annihilation operators act ﬁrst. The normal product can be extended
to linear combinations in a natural way. For example,
: αa−
p,sa+
q,r + βa+
p,sa+
q,r := αa+
q,ra−
p,s + βa+
p,sa+
q,r.
For electron creation and annihilation operators, there appears a sign change. Ex-
plicitly, we deﬁne
: b−
p,sb+
q,r : = −b+
q,rb−
p,s
along with the following conventions:
• : b+
p,sb−
q,r : = b+
p,sb−
q,r,
• : b+
p,sb+
q,r : = b+
p,sb+
q,r,
• : b−
p,sb−
q,r : = b−
p,sb−
q,r.
The same relations are true if we replace b±
p,s by c±
p,s, respectively.
The modiﬁed energy operator. We replace the operator Hfree by the normal
product : Hfree : . The linearity of the normal product yields
: Hfree :
= : Hphot : + : Hel : + : Hpos : .
We claim that
: Hfree : = Hphot + Hel + Hpos.
(12.26)
This means that the modiﬁed energy operator : Hfree : does not contain the vacuum
energy anymore. In the future, we will use the energy operator : Hfree : instead of
the operator Hfree. This means that the normal product is part of the quantization
procedure.
Proof. By Sect. 12.2.1 on page 812, the normal product : Hphot : is equal to

We now proceed as in Sect. 12.2.1. The normal product replaces the original product
a−
p,sa+
p,s by a+
p,sa−
p,s. It follows from (12.15) that

12.4 The Importance of Mathematical Models
Quantize carefully.
Folklore
In the history of quantum ﬁeld theory, physicists have encountered mathematical
contradictions several times. The trouble comes from the quantization procedure.
In order to quantize a classical ﬁeld theory, there exist several possibilities. In any
case, one has to pass from classical physical quantities to operators by adding
commutation and anticommutation relations as well as appropriate side conditions.
It may happen that all of these relations cannot be realized without producing
contradictions. Let us consider a simple example. Suppose that we want to quantize
the motion q = q(t) of a classical particle on the real line. To this end, we add the
commutation relation
qp −pq = iI,
(12.27)
and we regard q and p as (n × n)-matrices, n = 1, 2, ... However, this postulate can
never be realized. In fact, using the trace of matrices, it follows from (12.27) that
tr(qp) −tr(pq) = i tr(I) = in.
Since tr(qp) = tr(pq), we get n = 0. This is a contradiction.

12.4 The Importance of Mathematical Models
825
In order to avoid contradictions, one has to construct mathematical models.
Those mathematical models are also called representations of the abstractly given
quantities. In the case of the commutation relation (12.27), the standard model
reads as follows. We construct the complex linear space S(R), and we choose the
operators q, p : S(R) →S(R) deﬁned by
(qψ)(x) := xψ(x),
(pψ)(x) = −idψ(x)
dx
,
x ∈R
for all functions ψ
∈S(R). Summarizing, the commutation relation (12.27)
can never be realized in a ﬁnite-dimensional linear space, but only in inﬁnite-
dimensional linear spaces. The same argument shows that the commutation relation
aa† −a†a = I
cannot be realized by a ﬁnite-dimensional (n × n)-matrix. An inﬁnite-dimensional
model can be obtained by setting
a := q + ip
√
2
,
a† := q −ip
√
2
,
and by using the linear operators a, a† : S(R) →S(R).
12.4.1 The Trouble with Virtual Photons
Scalar photons can never exist in a Hilbert space.
Folklore
We want to show that the commutation relations (P1)–(P6) concerning creation
operators and annihilation operators a±
p,s for photons from Sect. 12.2.1 cannot be
realized within a Hilbert space structure. To this end, consider the state
Ψ := a+
p,3 |0⟩.
Let us assume the following:
(i) The commutation relations
a−
p,0a+
p,0 −a+
p,0a−
p,0 = −I
can be realized by operators living in some Hilbert space X.
(ii) There exists a unit vector |0⟩such that a−
p,0|0⟩= 0.
(iii) (a−
p,0)† = a+
p,0.
We want to prove that this implies
⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩< 0.
This is the desired contradiction. For simplifying notation, write a± instead of a±
p,0.
Then,
a−a+|0⟩= a+a−|0⟩−|0⟩= −|0⟩.
Hence ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩= ⟨0|(a+)†a+|0⟩= ⟨0|a−a+|0⟩= −⟨0|0⟩= −1.
This argument tells us that the commutation relations for scalar photons force
the use of indeﬁnite inner product spaces.

826

12.4.2 Indeﬁnite Inner Product Spaces
Relativistic invariance forces the use of indeﬁnite inner products.
Folklore
Deﬁnition. A complex linear space X is called a generalized inner product
space iﬀthere exists a symbol ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩such that for all ψ, ϕ, χ ∈X and all complex
numbers α, β, the following are met:
(i) ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩∈C.
(ii) ⟨ψ|αϕ + βχ⟩= α⟨ψ|ϕ⟩+ β⟨ψ|χ⟩.
(iii) ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩† = ⟨ϕ|ψ⟩.
(iv) ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩= 0 for all ϕ ∈X implies ψ = 0.
We speak of an inner product space (or pre-Hilbert space) iﬀthe inner product is
deﬁnite, i.e., ⟨ψ|ψ⟩> 0 for all nonzero elements ψ in X. Otherwise, we speak of an
indeﬁnite inner product space.19
Standard example. Let X = Cn. For all ψ, ϕ ∈Cn, we set
⟨ψ|ϕ⟩:= λ1(ψ1)†ϕ1 + . . . + λn(ψn)†ϕn
where λ1, ..., λn are nonzero real numbers. This inner product is deﬁnite iﬀall the
numbers λ1, ..., λn are positive. Otherwise the inner product is indeﬁnite.
Minkowski space. The linear space R4 equipped with the indeﬁnite inner
product
⟨x|y⟩:= x0y0 −x1y1 −x2y2 −x3y3,
x, y ∈R4,
is called Minkowski space. Introducing the deﬁnite inner product
⟨x|y⟩= x0y0 + x1y1 + x2y2 + x3y3,
x, y ∈R4,
on the linear space R4, we obtain the 4-dimensional Euclidean space.
12.4.3 Representation of the Creation and Annihilation Operators
in QED
Photons, electrons, and positrons are described by the tensor product of
the corresponding indeﬁnite and deﬁnite Fock spaces.
Folklore
In Sects. 12.2.1 and 12.2.2, we have introduced creation and annihilation operators
for photons, electrons, and positrons by postulating commutation and anticommu-
tation relations along with additional properties concerning both the vacuum and
adjoint operators. Motivated by the discussion in Sect. 12.4, we want to show that
all of these relations can be realized by an inﬁnite-dimensional mathematical model.
To this end, we will use a modiﬁcation of the Fock space introduced in Chap. 10.
The idea is to replace deﬁnite inner products by indeﬁnite inner products.
In what follows, let us ﬁx
• the cube C(L) of side length L > 0 in position space,
• the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ] of length T > 0, and
• the ﬁnite lattice G(N) in momentum space.
19 If X is a real linear space, then we assume that ⟨ψ|ϕ⟩is always real, and α, β
are real numbers in (i).

An ∈L2,sym(Ωn, C4n),

is the formally adjoint operator to the creation operator b+
p,s, that is,
⟨b−
p,sΨ|Φ⟩= ⟨Ψ|b+
p,sΦ⟩
for all
Ψ, Φ ∈Xel,ﬁn.
Explicitly, for each given sequence Ψ := (Ψ0, Ψ1, Ψ2, . . .) in Xel,ﬁn we deﬁne

Similarly,

Finally, b−

Creation and annihilation operators for positrons. Replacing ψ+
p,s by

The combined Fock space. In order to describe combined states of photons,
electrons, and positrons, we introduce the combined Fock space
X := Xphot ⊗Xel.
The elements of X are tuples of the form
(Am ⊗Ψn)m,n=0,1,...
Here, the tensor product (Am ⊗Ψn)(x1, . . . , xm, y1, . . . , yn) is equal to the tuple
(Aμ1...μm

(x1, . . . , xm) Ψ j1...jn

(y1, . . . , yn))
where Am ∈L2,sym(Ωm, C4m) and Ψn ∈L2,antisym(Ωn, C4n). The state
|0⟩:= |0⟩phot ⊗|0⟩el
is called the total vacuum state of X. In a natural way, the creation and annihilation
operators for photons can be extended from the photon Fock space Xphot to the
combined Fock space X by setting
a±
p,s(Am ⊗Ψn) := (a±
p,sAm) ⊗Ψn.
For the creation and annihilation operators of electrons and positrons, we obtain
b±
p,s(Am ⊗Ψn) := Am ⊗(b±
p,sΨn)
and c±
p,s(Am ⊗Ψn) := Am ⊗(c±
p,sΨn), respectively.
12.4.4 Gupta–Bleuler Quantization
Eliminate virtual photons as external particles.
Folklore
The Gupta-Bleuler approach to quantum electrodynamics was invented in 1950.22
The basic idea reads as follows. For states with negative norm ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩< 0, there
fails the usual probabilistic interpretation of states in quantum theory. Such states
are called ghost states.
(i) Introduction of ghosts: To simplify the formulation, besides real transversal
photons we introduce virtual photons (i.e., scalar and longitudinal photons)
which are related to ghost states.
22 N. Gupta, Theory of longitudinal photons in quantum electrodynamics, Proc.
Phys. Soc. (London) A63 (1950), 681–691.

12. The Free Quantum Fields of Electrons, Positrons, and Photons
(ii) Elimination of explicit ghosts: We distinguish between physical and nonphysi-
cal states. The restriction to physical states eliminates processes with virtual
photons as incoming or outgoing particles.
(iii) The implicit inﬂuence of ghosts: Observe the crucial fact that the inﬂuence
of the ghosts cannot be completely neglected. Interestingly enough, the cross
sections measured in scattering processes do not only depend on the ghost-free
incoming and out-going states, but also on the photon Feynman propagator
which depends on both real and virtual photons.
The Gupta-Bleuler method is the prototype for quantizing gauge theories in the
BRST setting. This will be considered in Vol. IV.
The trouble with the gauge condition. Consider ﬁrst the classical plane
wave
Aμ(x, t) :=
X
p∈G(N)

X
s=0
(a−
p,s ei(px−ωpt) + a+
p,s e−i(px−ωpt) Npeμ
s (p)
for μ = 0, 1, 2, 3. Here, a−
p,s are complex numbers, and a+
p,s is the conjugate complex
number to a−
p,s. By Sect. 12.2.1 on page 812, the gauge condition
a−
p,0 = a−
p,3
(12.30)
for all vectors p ∈G(N) implies that the electromagnetic ﬁeld
E := −grad U −˙A,
B := curl A
(12.31)
satisﬁes the Maxwell equations. We now pass to the corresponding free quantum
ﬁeld Aμ(x) by using creation operators a+
p,s and annihilation operators a−
p,s. Sup-
pose that the gauge condition (12.30) remains valid on the operator level. Then, the
same computation as for the classical ﬁeld shows that the ﬁeld operators (12.31)
satisfy the Maxwell equations.
Unfortunately, the gauge condition (12.30) contradicts the commutation
relations for the creation and annihilation operators.
In fact, according to Sect. 12.2.1, we have
a−
p,3a+
p,3 −a+
p,3a−
p,3 = I,
a−
p,0a+
p,0 −a+
p,0a−
p,0 = −I
along with a+
p,s = (a−
p,s)† for s = 0, 1, 2, 3. Thus, setting a−
p,3 = a−
p,0, we get the
contradiction I = −I. Therefore, we have to replace the gauge condition (12.30) by
a weaker condition. This problem was solved by Gupta and Bleuler in the following
way.
The physical space. By deﬁnition, the physical space Xphys is a linear sub-
space of the state space X which consists of all the states Ψ in X with the property
a−
p,0Ψ = 0,
a−
p,3Ψ = 0
along with ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩≥0. By a physical state Ψ, we understand an element of Xphys
with ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩> 0. Two elements Ψ and Φ of Xphys are called equivalent iﬀ
⟨Ψ −Φ|Ψ −Φ⟩= 0.
We write Ψ ∼Φ. In particular, Ψ ∼0 iﬀ⟨Ψ|Ψ⟩= 0.

12.4 The Importance of Mathematical Models
833
Examples of physical states. Recall that a photon is called transversal iﬀ
its polarization index s attains the values s = 1 or s = 2. We are given the vectors
p, q, r ∈G(N), the polarization indices
s, s1, s2 = 1, 2,
and the spin indices σ, τ = ± 1
2. Then the following states are physical states, and
they form an orthonormal system in the linear subspace Xphys of the combined
Fock space X:
(i) Vacuum: |0⟩.
(ii) One-particle states of transversal photons, electrons, and positrons:
a+
p,s|0⟩,
b+
q,σ |0⟩,
c+
r,τ |0⟩.
For example, a+
p,s|0⟩describes a photon of momentum vector p and transversal
polarization s = 1, 2.
(iii) Two identical transversal photons:
(a+
p,s)2 |0⟩
√

.
(iv) Two diﬀerent transversal photons: a+
p,s1a+
q,s2 |0⟩.23
(v) Two diﬀerent electrons: b+
p,σb+
q,τ |0⟩.
(vi) Two diﬀerent positrons: c+
p,σc+
q,τ |0⟩.
(vii) Mixed two-particle states: a+
p,sb+
q,σ |0⟩, a+
p,sc+
q,τ |0⟩, and b+
p,σc+
q,τ |0⟩.
(viii) Three identical transversal photons:
(a+
p,s)3 |0⟩
√

.
Proof. Ad (i). Set Ψ0 := |0⟩. Observe that ⟨Ψ0|Ψ0⟩= 1, and a−
p,0Ψ0 = a−
p,3Ψ0 = 0.
Ad (ii). For s = 1, 2, the commutation rule yields
(a−
p,sa+
p,s −a+
p,sa−
p,s)Ψ0 = IΨ0 = Ψ0.
Since a−
p,sΨ0 = 0, we obtain
⟨a+
p,sΨ0|a+
p,sΨ0⟩= ⟨Ψ0|a−
p,sa+
p,sΨ0⟩= ⟨Ψ0|Ψ0⟩= 1.
Moreover, we get a−
p,0(a+
p,sΨ0) = a+
p,sa−
p,0Ψ0 = 0. Similarly, a−
p,3(a+
p,sΨ0) = 0. An
analogous argument yields
(b−
p,σb+
p,σ + b+
p,σb−
p,σ)Ψ0 = Ψ0.
Since b−
p,σΨ0 = 0, we get
⟨b+
p,σΨ0|b+
p,σΨ0⟩= ⟨Ψ0|b−
p,σb+
p,σΨ0⟩= ⟨Ψ0|Ψ0⟩= 1.
Moreover, a−
p,r(b+
p,σΨ0) = b+
p,σa−
p,rΨ0 = 0 for r = 0, 3.
Ad (iii). It follows from the commutation rule
23 Naturally enough, we exclude the case where p = q and s1 = s2. In (v) and (vi),
we exclude the case where p = q and σ = τ.

p,sΨ0 + a+

This implies

p,sΨ0|a−
p,s(a+
p,s)2Ψ0⟩= 2⟨a+

Finally, a−
p,r(a+
p,r)2Ψ0 = (a+

p,rΨ0 = 0 for r = 0, 3. The remaining proofs
proceed analogously.

Examples of nonphysical states (ghost states). Let
s, s1, s2 = 0, 3
and σ, τ = ± 1
2. The following states are not physical states:
(a) One-particle state of virtual photons: a+
p,3 |0⟩, a+
p,0 |0⟩.
(b) Two identical electrons: (b+
p,σ)2 |0⟩.
(c) Two identical positrons: (c+
p,σ)2 |0⟩.
(d) Two-particle states including one virtual photon: a+
p,sb+
q,σ|0⟩.
(e) Two virtual photons: a+
p,s1a+
q,s2|0⟩.
Proof. Ad (a). Again let Ψ0 := |0⟩. Note that
a−
p,0(a+
p,0Ψ0) = −Ψ0 −a+
p,0a−
p,0Ψ0 = −Ψ0.
Since this is diﬀerent from zero, a+
p,0Ψ0 is not a physical state. Similarly, we obtain
a−
p,3(a+
p,3Ψ0) = Ψ0.
Ad (b), (c). We have (b+
p,σ)2Ψ0 = 0. This follows from the anticommutation rule
2(b+
p,σ)2 = [b+
p,σ, b+
p,σ]+ = 0.
Similarly, (c+
p,σ)2Ψ0 = 0.
Ad (d), (e). Noting that
a−
p,0a+
p,0 = −I + a+
p,0a−
p,0
along with a−
p,0b+
q,σ = b+
q,σa−
p,0 and a−
p,0Ψ0 = 0, we obtain
a−
p,0(a+
p,0b+
q,σΨ0) = −b+
q,σΨ0.
This is diﬀerent from zero. The remaining cases are treated similarly.

13. The Interacting Quantum Field, and the
Magic Dyson Series for the S-Matrix
Whoever understands the S-matrix (scattering matrix) can understand
everything in the theory of scattering processes for elementary particles.1
Folklore
Both Kaiser’s admirable Drawing Theories Apart and Schweber’s QED and
the Men Who Made It refer frequently to the famous lectures on quantum
electrodynamics given by Freeman Dyson at Cornell University (Ithaca,
New York) in 1951.2 Two generations ago, graduate students and their
professors wishing to learn the new techniques of QED passed around
copies of Dyson’s Cornell lectures, then the best and fullest treatment
available.3
David Derbes, 2007
Let us ﬁrst summarize the two key formulas (13.1) and (13.6). The motivation will
be given below.
13.1 Dyson’s Key Formula
Fix the time interval [−T
2 , T

operator reads as
S(T) := T exp

13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
Explicitly, we have4
Hint,free(x, t) = −eψfree(x, t)γμAμ
free(x, t)ψfree(x, t).
The meaning of the time ordering operator T will be explained in (T) below.5
The magic Dyson formula (13.1) represents the key formula of quantum
electrodynamics.
Using the classical power series expansion exp x = 1 + x + 1

reads explicitly as

which indicate the divergence of this series. The ﬁnite series

The graphical representation of the S-matrix operator S(T) in terms of
Feynman diagrams will be considered in Chap. 14.
It is crucial that the formula (13.1) above for Dyson’s S-matrix operator is explicitly
known, since Hint,free refers to the interaction term in quantum electrodynamics
expressed by free ﬁelds of electrons, positrons, and photons. In fact, Afree denotes
the free photon quantum ﬁeld from Sect. 12.2.1:
4 Recall that γμAμ = γμAμ = P3
μ=0 γμAμ, where A0 := A0, and Aj := −Aj for
j = 1, 2, 3.
5 According to our convention (10.17), we work in the energetic system, that is,
ℏ= c = ε0 = μ0 = k := 1. Hence e = √4παQED with the electromagnetic
ﬁne structure constant αQED = 1/137.04. This means that e and αQED are small
dimensionless quantities. In order to obtain the formula for S(T) in the SI system,
we have to replace −i by the quotient −i/ℏ, and e by the product ec.

(13.5)
Furthermore, observe the following:
(N) Normal operator product: The symbol : Hint,free : denotes the normal operator
product. By deﬁnition, the factors are reordered in such a way that all of the
creation operators stand to the left of the annihilation operators. For fermionic
operators, we add a sign factor which is the sign of the permutation needed for
obtaining the desired reordering. For example, in the case of photons we get
: a+
p,sa−
q,r : = : a−
q,ra+
p,s : = a+
p,sa−
q,r,
whereas we obtain
: b+
p,σb−
q,τ : = −: b−
q,τb+
p,σ : = b+
p,σb−
q,τ
in the case of electrons (or positrons).6
(T) Time ordering: The symbol T refers to time-ordering. By deﬁnition, the time-
depending operators are reordered in such way that the time arguments in-
crease from right to left. For fermionic operators, we add a sign factor which
is the sign of the permutation needed for obtaining the desired reordering. For
example, if t > s, then
T (B(x, t)B(y, s)) = T (B(y, s)B(x, t)) = B(x, t)B(y, s)
for bosonic operators (e.g., the photon ﬁeld), and
T (F(x, t)F(y, s)) = −T (F(y, s)F(x, t)) = F(x, t)F(y, s)
for fermionic operators (e.g., electron ﬁelds or positron ﬁelds). For equal times,
t = s, the T -product coincides with the usual product. The symbol T is also
called the chronological operator.
6 The general deﬁnition of the normal product can be found on page 823.

13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
The key formula for the transition probability in scattering processes
between electrons, positrons, and photons. Consider a scattering process
where Φint and Φout are unit vectors which correspond to the incoming and outgoing
particles, respectively. By deﬁnition, the number
W(T) := |⟨Φin|S(T)Φout⟩|2
(13.6)
represents the transition probability from the incoming particles to the outgoing
particles during the time-interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. For example, the symbol
Φin := a+
p,sb+
q,σ|0⟩
describes two incoming particles, namely,
• one incoming photon of momentum vector p and polarization s = 1, 2, and
• one incoming electron of momentum vector q and spin number σ = ± 1
2.
Similarly, the symbol
Φout := a+
p′,s′b+
q′,σ′|0⟩
corresponds to one outgoing photon and one outgoing electron. The scattering
process described by Φin and Φout is called Compton scattering in physics. The
transition probability and the related cross section for Compton scattering will be
computed in Sect. 15.1. In general, for scattering processes in quantum electrody-
namics, we will use the normalized states
Φin = (a+
p1,s1)n1
√n1!

pA,sA)nA
√nA!
b+
q1,σ1 · · · b+
qB,σBc+
r1,τ1 · · · c+
rC,τC|0⟩
which correspond to photons, electrons, and positrons. The particles live in the cubic
box C(L) of volume V := L3. The particle density ϱ of the photons corresponding
to a+
p1,s1 is equal to
ϱ = n1
V ,
and so on. Similar expressions are used for Φout.
Observe that Φin and Φout do not depend on time t. This is motivated by formula
(13.13) below.
Motivation for Dyson’s S-matrix operator. Let us motivate the key for-
mula (13.1) above. The idea is the following:
• First consider rigorously the ﬁnite-dimensional situation.
• Then pass to the inﬁnite-dimensional case by using a formal argument in a
straightforward manner. This motivates the deﬁnition (13.1).
To begin with, let us start with the rigorous Schr¨odinger equation
i ˙Ψ(t) = (Hfree + Hint)Ψ(t),
t ∈R,
(13.7)
in the n-dimensional complex Hilbert space Cn. Here,
Ψ(t) =
0
B
B
@
Ψ 1(t)
...
Ψ n(t)
1
C
C
A .
The given complex (n × n)-matrices Hfree and Hint are self-adjoint; they do not
depend on time t. Now we use the following rigorous arguments:

13.1 Dyson’s Key Formula
839
(i) The propagator of the Schr¨odinger equation: For given initial state Ψ(t0), the
unique solution of the Schr¨odinger equation (13.7) reads as
Ψ(t) = P(t, t0)Ψ(t0),
t ∈R,
(13.8)
with the propagator P(t, t0) := exp (−iHfree −iHint)(t −t0)) . It is our goal to
separate the free dynamics. We want to show that
P(t, t0) = e−itHfreeS(t, t0)eit0Hfree
(13.9)
along with
S(t, t0) := T exp
„
−i
Z t
t0
Hint(τ)dτ
«
(13.10)
where Hint(t) := eitHfreeHinte−itHfree.
(ii) The propagator of the transformed Schr¨odinger equation (the S-matrix): The
key idea is to use the transformation
Ψ(t) = e−itHfree Φ(t).
(13.11)
It follows from the Schr¨odinger equation (13.7) that
Hfreee−itHfreeΦ(t) + ie−itHfree ˙Φ(t) = (Hfree + Hint)e−itHfreeΦ(t).
Hence
ie−itHfree ˙Φ(t) = Hinte−itHfreeΦ(t).
This way, we get the transformed Schr¨odinger equation
i ˙Φ(t) = Hint(t)Φ(t),
t ∈R.
For given initial state Φ(t0), the unique solution reads as
Φ(t) = S(t, t0)Φ(t0)
along with (13.10). This follows from Sect. 7.17.4 of Vol. I. By (13.8), we have
Ψ(t) = P(t, t0)Ψ(t0). Using (13.11), we obtain
Φ(t) = eitHfreeP(t, t0)e−it0HfreeΦ(t0).
This tells us the validity of (13.9).
(iii) The transition probability: According to the rules of quantum mechanics, the
real number
W(t, t0) := |⟨Ψout(t)|P(t, t0)Ψin(t0)⟩|2
(13.12)
is the transition probability from the state Ψin at time t0 to the state Ψout at
time t provided ||Ψin(t0)|| = 1 and ||Ψout(t)|| = 1. Let us consider the special
case where
Ψin(t) := e−itHfreeΨin(0),
Ψout(t) := e−itHfreeΨout(0)
with ||Ψin(0)|| = ||Ψout(0)|| = 1. The functions t →Ψin(t) and t →Ψout(t)
are solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation (13.7) with vanishing interaction,
Hint = 0. Furthermore,

840
13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
||Ψin(t)|| = ||Ψout(t)|| = 1
for all
t ∈R,
since the operator e−itHfree is unitary for any time t. Intuitively, the functions
t →Ψin(t) and t →Ψout(t) represent an incoming and outgoing free particle,
respectively. Using (13.9), we get
W(t, t0) = |⟨Ψout(0)|S(t, t0)Ψin(0)⟩|2.
We are given the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. Choosing the initial time t0 := −T
2 and
the ﬁnal time t := T
2 , and setting S(T) := S(t, t0), we obtain the key formula
W(T) := |⟨Ψout(0)|S(T)Ψin(0)⟩|2.
(13.13)
Now let us use the rigorous ﬁnite-dimensional approach (i)–(iii) above in order to
motivate the deﬁnition of Dyson’s S-matrix operator S(T) from (13.1) on page 835.
Step 1: The Schr¨odinger equation for states in quantum electrodynamics: Let Ψ(t)
denote the state of a system of electrons, positrons, and photons at time t.
Then the Schr¨odinger equation reads as
i ˙Ψ(t) = (Hfree + Hint)Ψ(t),
t ∈R.
(13.14)
Here, the Hamiltonian Hfree of the interaction-free situation is given by (12.21)
on page 817. Furthermore, motivated by Theorem 11.2 on page 796, the inter-
action term of the Hamiltonian is given by
Hint :=
Z
C(L)
Hint(x)d3x
with
Hint(x) := −eψ(x) ̸A(x)ψ(x).
Recall Feynman’s slash symbol ̸A(x) := γμAμ(x). In this connection, observe
the following crucial fact. In the Schr¨odinger approach to quantum physics, the
state vectors Ψ(t) depend on time t whereas the observables (i.e., the physical
quantities) B do not depend on time t. This motivates our assumption that
Hint depends on the time-independent quantum ﬁeld ψ, A.
Step 2: The free Schr¨odinger equation: Consider the special case where the inter-
action vanishes, Hint = 0. Then, the dynamics of the state vectors is given
by
Ψ(t) = e−itHfreeΨ(0),
t ∈R.
If we deﬁne
B(t) := eitHfreeBe−itHfree,
t ∈R,
(13.15)
then we obtain
⟨Ψ(t)|BΨ(t)⟩= ⟨Ψ(0)|B(t)Ψ(0)⟩,
t ∈R.
This shows the invariance of the inner product, and hence the invariance
of expectation values. Physicists call the time-dependent operator function
B = B(t) the Heisenberg picture of the observable B with respect to the
free Hamiltonian.

13.2 The Basic Strategy of Reduction Formulas
841
Step 3: The transformed Schr¨odinger equation: As in (ii) above, the transforma-
tion Ψ(t) = e−itHfreeΦ(t) sends the Schr¨odinger equation (13.14) of quantum
electrodynamics to the equation
i ˙Φ(t) = Hint(t)Φ(t),
t ∈R
with Hint(t) := eitHfreeHinte−itHfree. Explicitly,
Hint(t) :=
Z
C(L)
eitHfreeHint(x)e−itHfreed3x.
Now to the point. Observe that eitHfreeHint(x)e−itHfree is equal to the product
−e(eitHfreeψ(x)e−itHfree) · (eitHfree ̸A(x)e−itHfree) · (eitHfreeψ(x)e−itHfree).
Motivated by the Heisenberg picture (13.15), we deﬁne
eitHfreeHint(x)e−itHfree := −eψfree(x, t) ̸Afree(x, t)ψfree(x, t)
where ψfree(x, t) and Afree(x, t) describe the dynamics of free quantum ﬁelds
in quantum electrodynamics.
Step 4: Dyson’s S-matrix operator: Using (13.10), we obtain the S-matrix operator
S(T) from (13.1) on page 835. More precisely, additionally, we have to replace
the operator product by the normal operator product.
Step 5: The normal operator product: Motivated by Sect. 12.2.2 on page 814, we
replace the Hamiltonian operator of quantum electrodynamics by its normal
product. This way we obtain the modiﬁed Schr¨odinger equation
i ˙Ψ(t) = (: Hfree : + : Hint :)Ψ(t),
t ∈R
(13.16)
in quantum electrodynamics. With respect to Dyson’s S-matrix operator S(T),
this means that we have to replace the operator Hint by the normal product
: Hint : in (13.1).
This ﬁnishes the motivation of the key deﬁnition (13.1) of Dyson’s S-matrix.
13.2 The Basic Strategy of Reduction Formulas
The computation of scattering processes in quantum ﬁeld theory can be
elegantly reduced to the computation of propagators by using the Wick
theorem.
Folklore
For scattering processes during the time-interval [−T
2 , T
2 ], our goal is to compute
the transition probability
W(T) := |⟨Ψout(0)|S(T)Ψin(0)⟩|2
based on Dyson’s S-operator S. According to Feynman, the inner product
⟨Ψout(0)|S(T))Ψin(0)⟩

842
13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
is called the transition amplitude. We will show that the transition amplitudes can
be reduced to vacuum expectation values
⟨0|T (A1A2 · · · An)|0⟩
where A1, ..., An are linear combinations of creation and annihilation operators,
and T denotes the operator of time-ordering. In turn, by reduction formulas, these
vacuum expectation values can be reduced to the simpler vacuum expectation values
⟨0|T (AB)|0⟩
of two factors. These expressions are called propagators.
Therefore, it remains to compute the propagators.
The reduction formulas can be represented graphically by using Feynman diagrams.
This will be studied in Chap. 14. In this chapter, we emphasize the algebraic as-
pects of the approach. This should help the reader to understand that the elegant
language of Feynman diagrams has a sound mathematical basis in terms of combi-
natorics. In particular, the algebraic approach clearly justiﬁes the appearance and
the speciﬁc values of the symmetry factors attributed to Feynman diagrams.
For the computation of propagators, there exist the following two diﬀerent uni-
versal methods:
(i) The Fourier method based on Fourier series for classical free ﬁelds.
(ii) The method of Feynman functional integrals (or path integrals) based on Gaus-
sian integrals.
In what follows, we will use method (i) in quantum electrodynamics, whereas
method (ii) will be thoroughly studied in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics.
Prototype of the Wick theorem. To explain the simple basic idea, let us
consider the typical transition amplitude
τ := ⟨b+Ω|ABa+Ω⟩
where Ω := |0⟩denotes the vacuum state, and a+, b+ are two (bosonic) creation
operators with the corresponding annihilation operators a−, b−, respectively. Fur-
thermore, A, B are complex linear combinations of creation and annihilation op-
erators. First let us represent the transition amplitude τ as a vacuum expectation
value. Since we have the key relation (b+)† = b−between creation and annihilation
operators, we get
τ = ⟨0|b−ABa+|0⟩.
The main trick is to deﬁne the so-called contraction
C(AB) := ⟨0|AB|0⟩
(13.17)
between the operators A and B. We claim the validity of the following reduction
formula for vacuum expectation values:
⟨0|b−ABa+|0⟩= C(b−A)C(Ba+) + C(b−B)C(Aa+).
(13.18)
As another example, we mention the following reduction formula:
⟨0|a−ABa+|0⟩= C(a−A)C(Ba+) + C(a−B)C(Aa+) + C(AB).
(13.19)
Before proving this, we need some preparations. Decompose

13.2 The Basic Strategy of Reduction Formulas
843
A = A+ + A−,
B = B+ + B−.
Here, A+, B+ (resp. A−, B−) are linear combinations of creation (resp. annihilation)
operators.
Special contractions for creation and annihilation operators. For the
creation operators a+, b+ and the annihilation operators a−, b−, we have the fol-
lowing commutation relations:
[a−, a+]−= I,
[b−, b+]−= I,
(13.20)
where I denotes the identical operator. In addition, we get
[a−, b±]−= 0,
[a+, b±]−= 0.
Furthermore, (a±)† = (a∓)† and (b±)† = (b∓)†. Finally, we have
a−|0⟩= 0,
b−|0⟩= 0.
(13.21)
Proposition 13.1 There hold C(a+a−) = C(a+a+) = C(a−a−) = 0, and
C(a−a+) = 1,
as well as C(a±b±) = C(a±b∓) = 0.
Proof. Set Ω := |0⟩. It follows from a−Ω = 0 that
C(a±a−) = ⟨Ω|a±a−Ω⟩= 0.
Moreover, noting that (a+)† = a−, we get
C(a+a±) = ⟨Ω|a+a±Ω⟩= ⟨a−Ω|a±Ω⟩= 0.
In addition, it follows from a−a+ = a+a−+ I and C(I) = ⟨Ω|IΩ⟩= ⟨Ω|Ω⟩= 1
that
C(a−a+) = C(a+a−) + C(I) = 1.
Since a−b± = b±a−, we obtain
C(a−b±) = C(b±a−) = ⟨Ω|b±a−Ω⟩= 0.
Finally, C(a+b±) = ⟨Ω|a+b±Ω⟩= ⟨a−Ω|b±Ω⟩= 0.
2
Further relations. We claim that Prop. 13.1 implies the following key rela-
tions:
[A−, B+]−= C(AB)I
(13.22)
and
[A−, a+]−= C(Aa+)I,
[b−, A+] = C(b−A)I.
Furthermore, [A+, B+]−= [A−, B−]−= 0. Finally, we have
[c+, C+]−= [c−, C−]−= 0
for C = A, B and c = a, b.
Proof of (13.22). By the commutation relations for creation and annihilation
operators, there exists a complex number A such that

844
13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
[A−, B+]−= AI.
Moreover, A−|0⟩= 0. This implies
⟨0|A+|0⟩= 0.
In fact, if A+ is a creation operator, then (A+)† = A−. Set Ω := |0⟩. Then
⟨Ω|A+Ω⟩= ⟨A−Ω|Ω⟩= 0.
The same argument tells us that ⟨0|A+A1A2 · · · An|0⟩= 0. Hence
A = ⟨0| [A−, B+]−|0⟩= ⟨0|A−B+ −B+A−|0⟩= ⟨0|A−B+|0⟩
= ⟨0|(A−+ A+)(B+ + B−)|0⟩= ⟨0|AB|0⟩= C(AB).
2
Proof of (13.18). We will use a brute force method. The more elegant approach
via the Wick theorem will be considered in the next section. The idea is to use the
operator identity7
CD = [C, D]−+ DC
for moving the annihilation operators a−, A−, B−to the right. Finally, we will apply
the relations A−|0⟩= B−|0⟩= a−|0⟩= b−|0⟩= 0. This implies
⟨0| · · · C−|0⟩= 0
(13.23)
for C = A, B, a, b. Furthermore, since (C+)† = C−, we also get
⟨0|C+ · · · |0⟩= 0.
(13.24)
The point is that this procedure cancels a lot of terms.
In what follows, the two key relations (13.23) and (13.24) will be used again
and again. In particular, we get
C(A+B) = C(AB−) = 0.
This implies C(AB) = C((A+ + A−)(B+ + B−)) = C(A−B+). To begin with, let us
use the following decomposition:
b−ABa+ = b−(A+ + A−)(B+ + B−)a+
= b−A+B+a+ + b−A+B−a+ + b−A−B+a+ + b−A−B−a+.
For example, consider the product b−A+B−a+. From the identity
B−a+ = [B−, a+]−+ a+B−= C(Ba+)I + a+B−
we get
b−A+B−a+ = C(Ba+)b−A+ + b−A+a+B−.
Since ⟨0|b−A+a+B−|0⟩= 0, it remains to consider the term C(Ba+)b−A+. From
C(Ba+)b−A+ = C(Ba+)C(b−A)I + C(Ba+)A+b−
7 Recall that [C, D]−:= CD −DC and [C, D]+ := CD + DC.

and ⟨0| · · · b−|0⟩= 0 we get

The other products are handled similarly.

In an analogous manner, one obtains the reduction formula (13.19). Using the
Wick theorem, a more elegant proof will be given on page 849.
Feynman diagrams. The terms from the reduction formulas (13.18) and
(13.19) can be represented graphically as pictured in Fig. 13.1. These graphs are
prototypes of Feynman diagrams containing both
• external lines corresponding to incoming and outgoing particles (also called legs),
• and internal lines (also called propagators).
In contrast to external lines, internal lines connect two nodes. We distinguish be-
tween
• connected Feynman graphs (Fig. 13.1(a)), and
• disconnected Feynman graphs (Fig. 13.1(b),(c)).
The Feynman graphs of quantum electrodynamics will be considered in Chap. 14.
A Feynman graph without external lines is called an amputated graph.
Propagators, Wightman’s functions, Green’s functions, and reduc-
tion formulas. The reduction formulas (13.18) and (13.19) on page 842 can be
equivalently written as
⟨0|b−ABa+|0⟩= ⟨0|b−A|0⟩· ⟨0|Ba+|0⟩+ ⟨0|b−B|0⟩· ⟨0|Aa+|0⟩
(13.25)
and
⟨0|a−ABa+|0⟩= ⟨0|a−A|0⟩· ⟨0|Ba+|0⟩+ ⟨0|a−B|0⟩· ⟨0|Aa+|0⟩
+⟨0|AB|0⟩.
(13.26)
Physicists use the following terminology:
• C(AB) = ⟨0|AB|0⟩(Wightman propagator or 2-point Wightman function).
• C(b−A) = ⟨0|b−A|0⟩and C(Ba+) = ⟨0|Ba+|0⟩(external legs).
• If the operators A and B depend on time, and if the symbol T denotes the
time-ordering operator, then
⟨0|T (AB)|0⟩
is called the 2-point Green’s function (or the Feynman propagator). This crucial
quantity describes correlations in quantum ﬁeld theory.
Formulas (13.25) and (13.26) are prototypes of reduction formulas in quantum ﬁeld
theory.8 These formulas tells us that:
8 Important reduction formulas were introduced by H. Lehmann, K. Symanzik,
and W. Zimmermann, On the formulation of quantized ﬁeld theories, Nuovo
Cimento 1 (1955), 205–225; 6 (1957), 319–333. They are called the LSZ reduction
formulas.

846
13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
The transition amplitudes of the S-matrix can be reduced to propagators
and external legs.
The external legs correspond to the free classical ﬁelds of incoming and outgoing
particles. Propagators describe the interactions of the particles during the scattering
process.The symmetry of general reduction formulas will be revealed in the next
section.
13.3 The Wick Theorem
Wick’s main theorem is a simple consequence of the algebraic relation
CD = [C, D]∓± DC.
This allows the eﬀective computation of transition probabilities in per-
turbative scattering theory for all kinds of quantum ﬁeld theories includ-
ing quantum electrodynamics and the Standard Model in particle physics.
Feynman diagrams graphically represent Wick’s main theorem.
Folklore
Wick’s main theorem on vacuum expectation values. Consider the vacuum
expectation value
τ := ⟨0|T (A1A2 · · · An)|0⟩,
n = 1, 2, . . .
of a time-ordered operator product. We assume that each time-dependent oper-
ator function Aj = Aj(t) is either bosonic or fermionic. By deﬁnition, a bosonic
(resp. fermionic) operator is a ﬁnite complex linear combination of bosonic (resp.
fermionic) creation and annihilation operators. Wick’s main theorem on general
reduction formulas reads as follows.
Theorem 13.2 If n is odd, then τ = 0. If n is even, then τ is equal to the sum of
all the products
η · ⟨0|T (Ai1Ai2)|0⟩· ⟨0|T (Ai3Ai4)|0⟩· · · ⟨0|T (Ain−1Ain)|0⟩
where i1, . . . , in is a permutation of 1, . . . , n, and η is the sign of this permuta-
tion by taking only the fermionic factors Aj into account. Moreover, the sequence
i1, i3, . . . , in−1 is increasing, and i1 < i2, i3 < i4, . . . , in−1 < in.
Let us ﬁrst consider a few examples. To simplify notation, set A1 := A, . . . For
n = 3, Theorem 13.2 tells us that
⟨0|T (ABC)|0⟩= 0.
Now let us consider the case where n = 4. Set T (AB)0 := ⟨0|T (AB)|0⟩. Theorem
13.2 yields the following:
(i) Bosonic case: Let A, B, C, D be bosonic operators. Then, we get the following
reduction formula:
T (ABCD)0 = T (AB)0T (CD)0 + T (AC)0T (BD)0 + T (AD)0T (BC)0.

13.3 The Wick Theorem
847
(ii) Fermionic case: Let A, B, C, D be fermionic operators. Then
T (ABCD)0 = T (AB)0T (CD)0 −T (AC)0T (BD)0 + T (AD)0T (BC)0.
Note that ACBD is an odd permutation of ABCD.
(iii) Mixed case: Let A, B, C be fermionic, and let D be bosonic. Then
T (ABCD)0 = T (AB)0T (CD)0 −T (AC)0T (BD)0 + T (AD)0T (BC)0.
Observe that ACBD is an odd permutation of the fermionic operators A, B, C.
Before giving the proof of Theorem 13.2 on page 851 (bosonic case) and page 855
(fermionic case and bosonic-fermionic case), we need some preparations concerning
paired normal products and time-ordered products. This leads to the ﬁrst and
second Wick theorem below. We have to distinguish between bosonic and fermionic
operators.
Bosonic Operators
Suppose that A1, . . . , An, A, B, . . . are bosonic operators. Decompose
Aj = A+
j + A−
j ,
j = 1, . . . , n
where A+
j (resp. A−
j ) contains creation (resp. annihilation) operators. By Sect. 13.2,
· · · A−|0⟩= 0
and
⟨0|A+ · · · |0⟩= 0.
Consequently, for the computation of vacuum expectation values, normal operator
products play a fundamental role. Recall that the normal operator product
: A1A2 · · · An :
represents a reordering of the operators such that the annihilation operators stand
to the right of the creation operators. For example, consider the product
AB = (A+ + A−)(B+ + B−) = A+B+ + A+B−+ A−B−+ A−B+.
Only the product A−B+ has to be reordered to B+A−. Hence
: AB := A+B+ + A+B−+ A−B−+ B+A−.
(13.27)
By (13.22) on page 843, A−B+ = B+A−+ C(AB) · I. Therefore,
AB = : AB : +C(AB) · I.
(13.28)
This is the prototype of the ﬁrst Wick theorem below. The normal product principle
tells us that:
Vacuum expectation values of normal operator products vanish.
For example, ⟨0| : AB : |0⟩= 0, since ⟨· · · A−|0⟩= ⟨0|A+ · · ·⟩= 0, and so on. The
idea of the ﬁrst Wick theorem is to reduce operator products to both normal oper-
ator products and multiples of the unit operator. By the normal product principle,
only the multiples of the unit operator contribute to vacuum expectation values. To
formulate the ﬁrst Wick theorem, it is convenient to introduce the notion of paired
normal product:

848
13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
• One pairing: We deﬁne : AB := C(AB) · I, and
: ABC := C(AB) · C,
: ABC := C(AC) · B,
: ABC := C(BC) · A.
Furthermore, we deﬁne
: ABCD := C(AB) : CD :,
: ABCD := C(AC) : BD :,
and so on.
• Two pairings: We deﬁne : ABCD := C(AB)C(CD) · I, and
: ABCD := C(AC)C(BD) · I,
: ABCD := C(AD)C(BC) · I.
Analogously, we deﬁne three pairings, four pairings, and so on. Let us now formulate
the ﬁrst Wick theorem.
Theorem 13.3 The operator product A1A2 · · · An is equal to the sum over all pos-
sible paired normal operator products:
: A1A2A3 · · · An : + : A1A2A3 · · · An : + . . .
+ : A1A2A3 · · · An : + : A1A2A3A4 · · · An : + . . .
Examples. Before proving Theorem 13.3, let us consider some examples:
(i) One factor: : A := A, and ⟨0|A|0⟩= ⟨0|A+|0⟩+ ⟨0|A−|0⟩= 0.
(ii) Two factors:
AB = : AB : + : AB : .
(13.29)
This stands for AB = : AB : +C(AB) · I which was proved in (13.28).
(iii) Three factors:
ABC = : ABC : + : ABC : + : ABC : + : ABC : .
This stands for
ABC = : ABC : +C(AB)C + C(AC)B + C(BC)A.
By the normal product principle, we get
⟨0|ABC|0⟩= 0.
(iv) Four factors:
ABCD = : ABCD : + : ABCD : + : ABCD : + : ABCD :
+ : ABCD : + : ABCD : + : ABCD :
+ : ABCD : + : ABCD : + : ABCD : .

13.3 The Wick Theorem
849
By the normal product principle, only the totally paired normal products, namely,
: ABCD := C(AB)C(CD) · I,
: ABCD := C(AC)C(BD) · I,
and : ABCD := C(AD)C(BC) contribute to the vacuum expectation value. Hence
⟨0|ABCD|0⟩= C(AB)C(CD) + C(AC)C(BD) + C(AD)C(BC).
In particular, noting that C(b−a+) = 0, we get
⟨0|b−BCa+|0⟩= C(b−B)C(Ca+) + C(b−C)C(Ba+).
This is the reduction formula (13.18) on page 842. Noting that C(a−a+) = 1, we
also obtain the following reduction formula:
⟨0|a−BCa+|0⟩= C(a−B)C(Ca+) + C(a−C)C(Ba+) + C(BC)
(13.30)
which coincides with (13.19).
Proof of the ﬁrst Wick Theorem 13.3 in the bosonic case.
Step 1: For n = 2, we get the statement from (ii) above.
Step 2: Consider now the case where n = 3. We will reduce this to the statement
for n = 2.
(I) To this end, we start with the decomposition
ABC = A+(BC) + A−(BC).
Moving A−to the right, we obtain9
(A−B)C = [A−, B]+C −(BA−)C = C(AB)C −(BA−)C.
Analogously, B(A−C) = C(AC)B + B(CA−). Hence
A−(BC) = (BC)A−+ C(AB)C + C(AC)B.
This implies
ABC = A+(BC) + (BC)A−+ C(AB)C + C(AC)B.
(II) Using the known case (13.29) for two factors, n = 2, we get
A+(BC) = A+ : BC : +A+ : BC :,
and (BC)A−= : BC : A−+ : BC : A−. Hence
ABC = (A+ : BC : + : BC : A−) + A+ : BC : + : BC : A−
+ : ABC : + : ABC : .
9 Note that [A−, B−]−= 0. Thus, by (13.22), we get
[A−, B+ + B−]−= [A−, B+]−= C(AB) · I.

850
13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
(III) By deﬁnition of the normal operator product, we have
A+ : BC := : A+BC :
and
: BC : A−= : BCA−: .
Note that the bosononic normal product is invariant under permutations of the
factors. Hence : BC : A−= : BCA−: = : A−BC : . Consequently,
A+ : BC : + : BC : A−= : (A+ + A−)BC : = : ABC : .
Finally, this yields
ABC = : ABC : + : ABC : + : ABC : + : ABC : .
This is precisely the claim for n = 3. The general case n = 4, 5, . . . follows analo-
gously by induction.
2
Time-ordered operator products. Now we want to replace operator prod-
ucts by time-ordered operator products. To this end, we assume that the bosonic
operators A1, A2, . . . , A, B, . . . depend on time t. Recall that time-ordering of an
operator product refers to a reordering of the factors such that time increases from
right to left. This is motivated by causality. In what follows, time-ordered prod-
ucts always refer to points in time t1, t2, . . . , tn which are pairwise diﬀerent. By
deﬁnition, we have
T (A1(t1)A2(t2) · · · An(tn)) := Ai1(ti1)Ai2(ti2) · · · Ain(tin)
where i1, i2, . . . , in is a permutation of 1, 2, . . . , n such that ti1 > ti2 > . . . > tin.
For example, if t > s, then
T (A(t)B(s)) = T (B(s)A(t)) := A(t)B(s).
Let us introduce the time-ordered contraction
CT (A(t)B(s)) := ⟨0|T (A(t)B(s))|0⟩.
Time-ordered paired normal products are deﬁned as above by replacing C(AB) by
CT (AB). For example, we deﬁne:
• : AB : = CT (AB) · I,
• : ABCD : = CT (AB)CT (CD) · I.
Let us ﬁrst consider the prototype of two factors. We claim that there holds
T (A(t)B(s)) = : A(t)B(s) : + : A(t)B(s) : .
(13.31)
This stands for
T (A(t)B(s)) = : A(t)B(s) : + CT (A(t)B(s)) · I.
To prove (13.31), let us start with the case where t > s. Then
A(t)B(s) = : A(t)B(s) : + : A(t)B(s) : .
This is identical with (13.31). Observe now that both the left-hand side and the
right-hand side of (13.31) are invariant under a permutation of t and s. Therefore,
equation (13.31) remains valid if s > t. The same argument yields the following
second Wick theorem.

13.3 The Wick Theorem
851
Theorem 13.4 The time-ordered operator product T (A1A2 · · · An) is equal to the
sum over the normal product and all the possible time-ordered pairings of the normal
product,
: A1A2A3 · · · An : + : A1A2A3 · · · An : + . . .
+ : A1A2A3 · · · An : + : A1A2A3A4 · · · An : + . . .
Proof of Wick’s Main Theorem 13.2 in the bosonic case. Using the normal
product principle, we obtain that the vacuum expectation value
⟨0|T (A1...An)|0⟩
is equal to the sum over all vacuum expectation values of totally paired normal
products. For example, we get
T (ABCD) = : ABCD : + : ABCD : + : ABCD : + : ABCD :

The totally paired normal products stand in the last line. This is equal to
CT (AB)CT (CD) · I + CT (AC)CT (BD) · I + CT (AD)CT (BC) · I.
By the normal product principle, the vacuum expectation value
⟨0|T (ABCD)|0⟩
is equal to
CT (AB)CT (CD) + CT (AC)CT (BD) + CT (AD)CT (BC).
Since CT (AB) = ⟨0|T (AB)|0⟩, we get the claim of Theorem 13.2. The general case
proceeds analogously.

Fermionic Operators
Now assume that A, B are fermionic operators. As in the bosonic case, we deﬁne
the contraction C(AB) by setting
C(AB) := ⟨0|AB|0⟩.
(13.32)
Special contractions for fermionic creation and annihilation opera-
tors. For two fermionic creation operators a+, b+ and the corresponding fermionic
annihilation operators a−, b−, we have the following anticommutation relations:
[a−, a+]+ = I,
[b−, b+]+ = I,
(13.33)
where I denotes the identical operator. In addition, we get
[a−, b±]+ = 0,
[a+, b±]+ = 0.
Furthermore, (a±)† = (a∓)† and (b±)† = (b∓)†. Finally, we have
a−|0⟩= 0,
b−|0⟩= 0.
(13.34)

13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
Proposition 13.5 There hold C(a+a−) = C(a+a+) = C(a−a−) = 0, and
C(a−a+) = 1,
as well as C(a±b±) = C(a±b∓) = 0.
Proof. Set Ω := |0⟩. It follows from a−Ω = 0 that
C(a±a−) = ⟨Ω|a±a−Ω⟩= 0.
Moreover, noting that (a+)† = a−, we get
C(a+a±) = ⟨Ω|a+a±Ω⟩= ⟨a−Ω|a±Ω⟩= 0.
In addition, it follows from a−a+ = −a+a−+ I and C(I) = ⟨Ω|IΩ⟩= ⟨Ω|Ω⟩= 1
that
C(a−a+) = −C(a+a−) + C(I) = 1.
Since a−b± = −b±a−, we obtain
C(a−b±) = −C(b±a−) = −⟨Ω|b±a−Ω⟩= 0.
Finally, C(a+b±) = ⟨Ω|a+b±Ω⟩= ⟨a−Ω|b±Ω⟩= 0.

General construction. Suppose that the operators A1, . . . , An, A, B, . . . are
fermionic.
The ﬁrst Wick Theorem 13.3 and the second Wick Theorem 13.4 remain
valid for fermionic operators.
Let us discuss this. The point is that we have to modify the deﬁnition of normal
products, paired normal products, and time-ordered products. The reason for that
is the relation
CD = [C, D]+ −DC
which forces us to introduce additional signs related to the sign of permutations of
fermionic operators. The modiﬁed notions read as follows:
(a) Normal product: The normal operator product
: A1A2 · · · An :
represents a reordering of the fermionic operators such that the annihilation
operators stand to the right of the creation operators. In contrast to the bosonic
case, there appears an additional sign which is the sign of the necessary per-
mutation of factors. For example, : A := A, and
: A+B−:= A+B−,
: B−A+ := −A+B−.
From the product formula
AB = (A+ + A−)(B+ + B−) = A+B+ + A+B−+ A−B−+ A−B+
we get
: AB := A+B+ + A+B−+ A−B−−B+A−.
(13.35)
This implies
AB = : AB : +[A−, B+]+.
(13.36)

13.3 The Wick Theorem
853
Furthermore, for three factors, we obtain
: A+B+C−:= A+B+C−,
: A+C−B+ := −A+B+C−.
In general, the normal product remains unchanged (resp. changes sign) under
even (resp. odd) permutations of the fermionic factors. The normal product
principle remains valid, that is, the vacuum expectation values of normal prod-
ucts vanish.
(b) Contraction: Using (13.32), we get10
[A−, B+]+ = C(AB) · I.
(13.37)
Moreover, [A−, B−]+ = 0, by Prop. 13.5. Hence
[A−, B]+ = [A−, B+ + B−]+ = C(AB) · I.
(13.38)
(c) Paired normal product: Deﬁning
: AB : = C(AB) · I,
we obtain the following key relation:
AB = : AB : + : AB : .
(13.39)
This formula follows immediately from (13.36) and (13.37). More generally, we
deﬁne
: ABC : = C(AB) · C,
: ABC : = −C(AC) · B,
: ABC : = C(BC) · A.
Furthermore, : ABCD : = C(AB)C(CD) · I, and
: ABCD : = −C(AC)C(BD) · I,
: ABCD : = C(AD)C(BC) · I.
The general deﬁnition goes like this:
• For one pairing, set
: A1 · · · Ai · ·Aj · · · An : = (−1)j−i+1C(AiAj) : A1 · · · ˙Ai · · ˙Aj · · · An :
where the dotted factors have to be cancelled.
• The same deﬁnition will be used for several pairings where we assume that
Ai stands to the left of all the other pairings.
10 To prove this, note that the anticommutation relations tell us that [A−, B+]+
is equal to AI with a real number A. Hence ⟨0| [A−, B+]+|0⟩= ⟨0|AI|0⟩= A.
Therefore, A is equal to
⟨0|A−B+ + B+A−|0⟩= ⟨0|A−B+|0⟩= ⟨0|(A−+ A+)(B+ + B−)|0⟩= C(AB).

854
13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
This allows us to deﬁne paired normal products in an inductive way. For ex-
ample,
: ABCD : = −C(AC) : BD := −C(AC)C(BD) · I,
and
: ABCD : = C(AD) : BC := C(AD)C(BC) · I.
Observe that the following hold:
The paired normal product remains unchanged (resp. changes sign)
under even (resp. odd) permutations of the fermionic factors.
Note that, in the bosonic case, the paired normal product is invariant under
all kind of permutations of the bosonic factors.
(d) Time-ordered product: For t > s, we deﬁne
T (A(t)B(s)) = −T (B(s)A(t)) := A(t)B(s).
In general, let t1, ..., tn be n pairwise diﬀerent time points. By deﬁnition, the
time-ordered product
T (A1(t1) · · · An(tn))
is equal to
η · Ai1(ti1) · · · Ain(tin)
such that ti1 > ti2 > . . . > tin, and η is the sign of the permutation from 1 . . . n
to i1 . . . in. As in the bosonic case, we deﬁne the time-ordered contraction by
CT (A(t)B(s)) := ⟨0|T (A(t)B(s))|0⟩.
(e) Time-ordered paired normal product: This product is deﬁned parallel to the
paired normal product by replacing each contraction C(AjAk) by CT (AjAk).
For example, we deﬁne
: ABCD : = CT (AD)CT (BC) · I.
As another example, consider
: ABCDE : = −CT (AC) : BDE : = CT (AC)CT (BE) · D.
Proof of the ﬁrst Wick Theorem 13.3 in the fermionic case. We will pro-
ceed as in the bosonic case. The only diﬀerence is that we replace commutation
relations [A, B]−by anticommutation relations [A, B]+, and that we observe the
sign convention for the permutations of the fermionic factors of normal products.
Step 1: For n = 2, the statement follows from (13.39).
Step 2: Consider now the case where n = 3. We will reduce this to the statement
for n = 2.
(I) To this end, we start with the decomposition
ABC = A+(BC) + A−(BC).
Moving A−to the right, it follows from (13.38) that
(A−B)C = [A−, B]+C −(BA−)C = C(AB)C −(BA−)C.

13.3 The Wick Theorem
855
Analogously, B(A−C) = C(AC)B −B(CA−). Hence
A−(BC) = (BC)A−+ C(AB)C −C(AC)B.
This implies
ABC = A+(BC) + (BC)A−+ C(AB)C −C(AC)B.
(II) Using the known case (13.39) for two factors, n = 2, we get
A+(BC) = A+ : BC : +A+ : BC :,
and (BC)A−= : BC : A−+ : BC : A−. Hence
ABC = (A+ : BC : + : BC : A−) + A+ : BC : + : BC : A−
+ : ABC : + : ABC : .
(III) By deﬁnition of the normal operator product, we have
A+ : BC := : A+BC :
and
: BC : A−= : BCA−: .
Note that the fermionic normal product is invariant under even permutations of
the factors. Hence : BC : A−= : BCA−: = : A−BC : . Consequently,
A+ : BC : + : BC : A−= : (A+ + A−)BC : = : ABC : .
Finally, this yields
ABC = : ABC : + : ABC : + : ABC : + : ABC : .
This is precisely the claim for n = 3. The general case n = 4, 5, . . . follows analo-
gously by induction.

Proof of Wick’s Main Theorem 13.2 in the fermionic case. The proofs
of both the second Wick Theorem 13.4 and the Main Wick Theorem 13.2 in the
fermionic case proceed analogously to the bosonic case above.
The Bosonic-Fermionic Case
We now consider mixed operator products
A1A2 · · · An
where each factor is either bosonic or fermionic. Such products occur in quantum
electrodynamics.
The ﬁrst Wick theorem 13.3 and the second Wick Theorem 13.4 remain
valid for operator products of mixed type.
This follows from the fact that bosonic operators commute with fermionic operators.
This implies that:
Pairings between bosonic and fermionic operators drop out.

856
13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
For example, if A is bosonic and B is fermionic, then C(AB) = 0. In fact,
C(AB) = ⟨0|AB|0⟩= ⟨0|(A+ + A−)(B+ + B−)|0⟩
= ⟨0|(A+B+ + A+B−+ B+A−+ A−B−)|0⟩= 0.
This follows from A−B+ = B+A−.
Internal normal products. Suppose that AB is a normal operator product.
By the normal product principle, we get
C(AB) = ⟨0|AB|0⟩= 0.
This implies that pairings drop out if the factors belong to a normal product. For
example, the product A : BCDE : FG is equal to
A : BCDE : FG =: A : BCDE : FG : + : A : BCDE : FG : + . . .
This corresponds to the formula for A : BCDE : FG where the pairings between
the operators B, C, D, E drop out. This fact will simplify the Feynman diagrams in
quantum electrodynamics.
Invariance properties of products. Note that the following hold true:
• Normal products or paired normal products are invariant under both permuta-
tions of bosonic operators and even permutations of fermionic operators.
• Normal products or paired normal products change sign under odd permutations
of fermionic operators.
• Time-ordered products or time-ordered paired normal products are invariant
under both permutations of bosonic operators and even permutations of fermionic
operators.
• Time-ordered products or time-ordered paired normal products change sign un-
der odd permutations of fermionic operators.
13.4 Feynman Propagators
In terms of physics, Feynman propagators describe the propagation of
physical eﬀects in quantum ﬁeld theory by taking both causality and an-
tiparticles into account.
In terms of mathematics, Feynman propagators are distinguished funda-
mental solutions of the wave equation, the Klein–Gordon equation, and
the Dirac equation. In the Fourier space, Feynman propagators are inverse
diﬀerential operators, after regularization.
Folklore
It was discovered by Feynman in the 1940s that the propagation of quantum eﬀects
is governed by speciﬁc functions called propagators. From the modern point of view,
propagators arise in a natural way from the Wick technique in perturbation theory.
13.4.1 Discrete Feynman Propagators for Photons and Electrons
As a typical example, let us compute the Feynman propagators of quantum elec-
trodynamics, namely,
• the Feynman photon propagator Dμν

with the photon energy ωp := |p|. The symbol Σ′ indicates that we do not sum
over p = 0. The reader, who wants to become familiar with the Feynman rules in
quantum electrodynamics, may immediately pass to Chap. 14.
The discrete Feynman propagators are ﬁnite Fourier series.
The regularized discrete Feynman propagators and the continuum limit of Feynman
propagators will be studied in Sects. 13.4.2 and 13.4.3, respectively. The continuum
limit of Feynman propagators leads to well-deﬁned mathematical objects, namely,
tempered distributions. Applications to interesting physical processes can be found
in Chap. 15.

Deﬁnition of the discrete Feynman photon propagator. Choose the
space-time points x = (x, t) and y = (y, s). Let μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3. The most im-
portant quantity for describing photons in quantum electrodynamics is deﬁned by
Dμν
F (x, y) := ⟨0|T (Aμ
free(x)Aν
free(y))|0⟩
for all times t and s with t ̸= s. This vacuum expectation value of the time-ordered
operator product
Aμ
free(x)Aν
free(y)
is called the discrete Feynman photon propagator Dμν
F (x, y) of the free photon ﬁeld.
Synonymously, we also speak of the discrete free 2-point Green function Dμν
F
of the
photon ﬁeld.12 Intuitively,
12 The relation to classical Green’s functions (fundamental solutions of partial dif-
ferential equations) will be studied below.

• the Feynman propagator Dμν
F (x, y) measures the correlation between the com-
ponents
Aμ
free(x, t)
and
Aν
free(y, s)
of the free photon ﬁeld if Aν
free acts ﬁrst, that is, t > s.
• If t < s, then the Feynman propagator Dμν
F (x, y) measures the correlation be-
tween the components
Aν
free(y, s)
and
Aμ
free(x, t)
of the free photon ﬁeld. Here, Aμ
free acts ﬁrst.
• If t = s and x ̸= y, we deﬁne
Dμν
F (x, t; y, t) := 0.
This is motivated by the fact that, in the theory of special relativity, physical
eﬀects propagate maximally with the speed of light. This implies that there are
no correlations between the free photon ﬁeld at diﬀerent space points, x ̸= y, at
equal time, t = s.
• In the singular case where x = y and t = s, there does not exist a generic
deﬁnition for the correlations between Aμ
free(x) and Aν
free(x).13
Theorem 13.6 For all space-time points x, y ∈R4 corresponding to diﬀerent
times, t ̸= s, the discrete Feynman propagator of the free photon ﬁeld reads as
Dμν
F (x, y) = −ημνGF (x −y),
μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
This tells us that the propagator Dμν
F (x, y) only depends on the diﬀerence x−y.
In what follows, we will write Dμν
F (x −y) instead of Dμν
F (x, y). Before proving this
theorem, let us discuss the physical interpretation. In terms of physics, the function
θ(t)e−ipx =
(
0
if
t < 0,
eipxe−iωpt
if
t > 0
describes the creation of one photon at the initial time t = 0. This photon has the
momentum vector p and the energy ωp = |p|. Furthermore, the function
θ(−t)eipx =
(
e−ipxeiωpt
if
t < 0,
0
if
t > 0
describes the annihilation of one incoming photon at time t = 0. This photon has
the momentum vector −p and the energy ωp. This tells us that:
13 For example, we could use one of the following deﬁnitions
⟨0|Aμ(x)Aν(x)|0⟩,
⟨0|Aν(x)Aμ(x)|0⟩
or the mean value
1
2⟨0| (Aμ(x)Aν(x) + Aν(x)Aμ(x)) |0⟩. This element of arbi-
trariness is always related to substantial trouble caused in quantum ﬁeld theory
by the operator T of time-ordering. From the mathematical point of view, the
Epstein–Glaser approach to quantum ﬁeld theory overcomes this diﬃculty in
rigorous terms by using the modern theory of tempered distributions (gener-
alized functions). This will be thoroughly studied in Vol. IV. We also refer to
the monograph by G. Scharf, Finite Quantum Electrodynamics: the Causal Ap-
proach, Springer, Berlin, 1995.

Deﬁnition of the discrete Feynman electron propagator. Choose the
space-time points x = (x, t) and y = (y, s). Let α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3. The most impor-
tant quantity for describing electrons and positrons in quantum electrodynamics is
deﬁned by
Sαβ
F (x, y) := ⟨0|T (ψα

tor Sαβ
F (x, y) of the free electron-positron ﬁeld. Synonymously, we also speak of the
discrete free 2-point Green function Sαβ
F
of the electron-positron ﬁeld. Interestingly
enough, it turns out that Sαβ
F
is closely related to the Feynman function GF via the
Dirac equation. To discuss this, deﬁne the matrix function
SF (x) := (iγμ∂μ + me)GF,me(x)
where me denotes the electron mass. To simplify the notation, we use the same
symbol for the two diﬀerent functions (x, y) →SF (x, y) and x →SF (x). This is
justiﬁed by the following result.
Theorem 13.7 For all space-time points x, y ∈R4 corresponding to diﬀerent
times, t ̸= s, the discrete Feynman electron propagator reads as
Sαβ
F (x, y) = Sαβ
F (x −y),
α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3.

Hence

This implies the following representation formula
SF (x, y) =
X
p∈G(N)
N 2
p(iγμ∂μ + me)e−ip(x−y)
where the derivative ∂μ refers to the variable x. Since N 2
p = Δ3p/2(2π)3Ep, we
ﬁnally obtain
SF (x, y) = (iγμ∂μ + me)GF,me(x −y).

2(2π)3Ep (θ(t)e−ipx e−εt + θ(−t)eipx eεt).
Here, we use the lattice G(N) introduced in Sect. 12.1.1 on page 799. Furthermore,
we set px := Ept −px, and Ep :=
q
p2 + m2
ph with mph > 0. This means that
• we replace the photon energy ωp =
p
p2 by the regularized photon energy Ep
where mph represents a small (artiﬁcial) photon mass, and
• we introduce the small damping coeﬃcient ε > 0.
Note that the photon energy ωp vanishes if the momentum vector of the photon
vanishes, p = 0. In contrast to this, the regularized photon energy Ep never vanishes.
Thus, the denominator Ep appearing in the regularized Feynman function is well
deﬁned for all momentum vectors p. In addition, the oscillations e∓iωpt are replaced
by damped oscillations which vanish if time goes to inﬁnity. Explicitly,
lim
t→±∞e∓iEpte∓εt = 0.
The damping coeﬃcient ε arises by shifting the photon energy E(p) to the complex
value
Ep −iε,
ε > 0
which lives in the upper complex plane.14
Feynman’s integral trick for propagators. Let us simplify the expressions
for the Feynman propagators by passing over to the 4-dimensional Fourier space.

Here, we set p2 := (p0)2 −p2, and px := p0t −px, along with
εp := 2Epε −iε2.
The proof given below will be based on the following key relation:

for all space-time points x, y with diﬀerent times t ̸= s.

13.4.3 The Continuum Limit of Feynman Propagators
Physics does not depend on the choice of the discretization method.
The golden heuristic rule
The regularized discrete photon propagator Dμν
F,ε,mph and the regularized discrete
electron propagator Sμν
F,ε will enter the Feynman rules in Chap. 14.
This way, we will obtain well-deﬁned expressions in each order of pertur-
bation theory.
However, observe that these propagators depend on the choice of the grid G(N) in
the momentum space introduced in Sect. 12.1.1. From the physical point of view,
it is quite natural to study the limit
G(N) →R3
(13.44)
where the grid G(N) passes over to the 3-dimensional continuous momentum space
R3. It is our goal to obtain the formulas

F
and the Feynman electron
propagator distribution SF . Here, GF and GF,me denote the Feynman propagator
distribution for the wave equation and the Klein–Gordon equation, respectively,
deﬁned in (13.51) on page 868. All of these distributions are tempered distributions
on the space-time manifold R4, that is, they live in the space S′(R4). Let us discuss
the basic ideas.
Step 1 : Low-energy limit Δ3p →0. Fix the maximal momentum Pmax of the grid
G(N), and let the volume of the grid cells go to zero, L →0. This corresponds to
the limit Δ3p →0. Motivated by Theorem 13.8, the deﬁnition of the truncated
Feynman propagator Dμν
F,ε,mph,Pmax(x) reads as

(13.45)
This tells us that the Fourier–Minkowski transform of DF,ε,mph,∞is given by
(FMDF,ε,mph,∞)(p) = −
iημν
(2π)2(p2 −m2
ph + εpi)
(13.46)
for all p ∈R4. However, this is only a formal argument, since the Fourier
integral (13.45) does not exist, in the classical sense. The trouble is that the
integrand decays too slowly for large energies, |p| →∞.
To overcome this diﬃculty in a quite natural way, we will use the theory of tempered
distributions together with the Fourier–Minkowski transform (see Sects. 11.3 and
14.1 of Vol. I). Let us discuss this. Recall ﬁrst that, for each function g ∈S(R4),
the Fourier–Minkowski transform FMg is given by
(FMg)(p) :=
1
(2π)2
Z
R4 eipxg(x) d4x,
p ∈R4
(13.47)
with px := p0t −px. The inverse Fourier–Minkowski transformation reads as
g(x) :=
1
(2π)2
Z
R4 e−ipx(FMg)(p) d4p,
x ∈R4.
The map FM : S(R4) →S(R4) is linear and bijective. For each tempered distribu-
tion T ∈S′(R4), the Fourier–Minkowski transform is deﬁned by
(FMT)(ϕ) = T(FMϕ)
for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R4). The induced map FM : S′(R4) →S′(R4) is
linear and bijective. The function from (13.46) is locally integrable. Therefore, it
represents a tempered distribution T given by
T(ϕ) := −iημν

Dμν
F,ε,mph,∞:= F −1
M (T)
(13.48)
for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R4). The tempered distribution Dμν
F,ε,mph,∞is called the
regularized Feynman propagator distribution for photons. It follows from (13.48)
that

Proposition 13.9 In the sense of tempered distributions on R4, we have the limit
relation
lim
(ε,mph)→+(0,0) 2 Dμν
F,ε,mph,∞= iημνδ,
where δ denotes the Dirac delta distribution.
The limit refers to sequences of pairs (ε, mph) with ε > 0 and mph > 0. We
will show below that the much stronger result holds: it is possible to deﬁne the
Feynman propagator distribution for photons, Dμν
F , in such a way that
2 Dμν
F = iημνδ,
and the deﬁnition of Dμν
F is independent of the choice of the regularization method.
Proof of Proposition 13.9. By deﬁnition, for a sequence (Tn), of tempered dis-
tributions Tn, the convergence
lim
n→∞Tn = T
is equivalent to limn→∞Tn(ϕ) = T(ϕ) for all test functions ϕ ∈S(R4). Since the
Fourier–Minkowski transform respects the convergence of tempered distributions,
we have to show that
lim
(ε,mph→+(0,0) FM(2 DF,ε,mph,∞) = iημνFM(δ).
Note that, in the Fourier space, the wave operator 2 corresponds to the multiplica-
tion with the factor −p2 = −(p0)2 +p2, and δ corresponds to the function 1/(2π)2.
Therefore, it remains to show that
lim
(ε,mph)→+(0,0)

Obviously, this is true. In this connection recall that E2

ph, and observe
that the denominator
(p0)2 −(Ep −εi)2 = p2 −m2
ph + εpi
is diﬀerent from zero if ε > 0 and mph > 0.

13.4 Feynman Propagators
867
The importance of the Feynman propagator as an inverse diﬀerential
operator. For quantum ﬁeld theory, it is crucial that the Feynman propagator
represents an inverse diﬀerential operator, in some sense. This is responsible for
the surprising success of the Feynman functional integral method in quantum ﬁeld
theory, as we will show in Vol. IV. The classical background is the Gaussian integral
formula
Z
Rn e−1
2 ⟨x|Ax⟩e⟨J|x⟩
dnx
(2π)n/2 = e
1
2 ⟨J|A−1J⟩(det A−1)1/2
(13.49)
where A denotes a real nonsingular symmetric (n × n)-matrix, and J ∈Rn. Explic-
itly,
⟨x|Ax⟩=
n
X
j,k=1
ajkxjxk,
⟨J|x⟩=
n
X
k=1
Jkxk.
Note that the value of the integral (13.49) depends essentially on the inverse opera-
tor A−1. The Feynman functional integral can be viewed as an inﬁnite-dimensional
version of (13.49) where
• ⟨x|Ax⟩corresponds to the action integral of the classical ﬁeld, and
• the diﬀerential operator A corresponds to the Euler–Lagrange equation of the
classical ﬁeld.
Consider ﬁrst a simple ﬁnite-dimensional model. For the diagonal matrix
A =
 
p1 0
0 p2
!
with nonzero numbers p1, p2, the inverse matrix is given by
A−1 =
 
1
p1
0
0
1
p2
!
.
In the singular case where p1 = 0 and , say, p2 ̸= 0, we can regularize the situation
by replacing p1 = 0 with the small positive number ε.
In the inﬁnite-dimensional case of diﬀerential operators, this method can be
generalized by using the Fourier–Minkowski transform. Let us discuss this.
Step 1 : Formal Fourier–Minkowski transformation. Consider the wave equation
2 GF = −iδ
on the 4-dimensional space-time manifold. By Fourier–Minkowski transforma-
tion, we obtain the relation FM(2 GF ) = −iFM(δ). Hence
((p0)2 −p2)FM(GF ) =
i
(2π)2 .
This yields
FM(GF )(p) =
i
(2π)2p2 .
Formally, in the Fourier space the diﬀerential operator 2 corresponds to the
multiplication by −p2, and the Feynman function GF corresponds to the inverse
operation. Hence

13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
GF (x) =
1
(2π)2
Z
R4
i
(2π)2p2 e−ipx d4p.
(13.50)
Symbolically, let us write
GF = (2)−1(−iδ).
However, there arises the following serious problem. The equation p2 = 0, that
is,
(p0)2 −p2 = 0
has the real solutions p0 = ±|p| which correspond to the photon energy. There-
fore, the Fourier–Minkowski transform FM(GF ) has singularities. In addition,
the Fourier integral (13.50) does not exist in the classical sense, since the in-
tegrand decays too slowly at inﬁnity. This is related to the fact that, for given
smooth function f, the classical wave equation
2 G = f
has an inﬁnite number of solutions which depend on both the initial values of
G and the partial time derivative Gt at the initial time t = 0.
Step 2 : Regularization. As discussed above, to overcome the trouble we replace the
Fourier–Minkowski transform FM(GF ) by the regularized Fourier–Minkowski
transform
i
(2π)2 ·
1
(p0)2 −(Ep −εi)2
with Ep :=
q
p2 + m2
ph and ε > 0, mph > 0. In addition, the inverse Fourier–
Minkowski transform is to be understood in the sense of tempered distributions.
Observe that there exist many possibilities for choosing the regularization of the
Fourier–Minkowski transform. There arises the question whether it is possible to
deﬁne the Feynman propagator in such a way that it is independent of the special
choice of the regularization procedure. This is possible, as we will show in Vol. IV.
At this point, let us only sketch the basic ideas.
The Feynman propagator distributions. We deﬁne the following tempered
distributions:
(i) The Feynman propagator distribution for the wave equation:
GF (x) :=
i
(2π)2
Z
R4
1
(2π)2(p2 + 0+i) e−ipx d4p.
(13.51)
(ii) The Feynman propagator distribution for the Klein-Gordon equation with mass
m > 0:
GF,m(x) :=
i
(2π)2
Z
R4
1
(2π)2(p2 −m2 + 0+i) e−ipx d4p.
(13.52)
(ii) The Feynman propagator distribution for photons: For μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3, we set
Dμν
F := −ημνGF .
(13.53)

13.4 Feynman Propagators
869
(iii) The Feynman propagator distribution for electrons: We set
SF := (iγμ∂μ + me)GF,me.
(13.54)
Explicitly, we have
SF =
i
(2π)2
Z
R4
γμpμ + meI
(2π)2(p2 −m2e + 0+i) e−ipx d4p.
These mnemonical formulas are to be understood in the following sense. The tem-
pered distribution GF is the inverse Fourier–Minkowski transform of the tempered
distribution
1
(2π)2(p2 + 0+i).
(13.55)
This distribution is deﬁned by combining regularization, analytic continuation, and
limits of tempered distributions. More generally, our goal is to construct tempered
distributions denoted by
Tλ =
1
(p2 −m2 + 0+i)λ
(13.56)
for each mass parameter m ≥0 and each complex exponent λ diﬀerent from
−2, −3, . . . To this end, ﬁx the regularization parameter ε > 0, and the positive
exponent λ > 0. For each complex point z in the open upper half-plane, ℑz > 0,
we choose the argument 0 < arg z < π, and we set
zλ := eλ(ln |z|+i arg z).
In this sense, for each test function ϕ ∈S(R4), the integral
Tλ,ε(ϕ) :=
Z
R4(p2 + εi
4
X
j=1
(pj)2)λϕ(p)d4p
is well-deﬁned. The function
λ →Tλ,ε(ϕ)
can be analytically continued to a function which is holomorphic on the punctured
complex plane C \ {−2, −3, −4, ...}. For these λ-values, the limit
Tλ(ϕ) := lim
ε→+0 Tε,λ(ϕ)
exists for all ϕ ∈S(R4). This way, we obtain the desired tempered distributions
from (13.56). Let us summarize the Fourier–Minkowski transform of propagators:
(i) Feynman propagator of the wave equation:
(FMGF )(p) =
i
(2π)2(p2 + 0+i).

870
13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
(ii) Feynman propagator of the Klein–Gordon equation with mass m > 0 :
(FMGF,m)(p) =
i
(2π)2(p2 −m2 + 0+i).
(iii) Feynman propagator of photons:
(FMDμν
F )(p) = −
iημν
(2π)2(p2 + 0+i),
μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(iv) Feynman propagator of electrons:
(FMSF )(p) =
i(γμpμ + meI)
(2π)2(p2 −m2e + 0+i).
Using the inverse Fourier–Minkowski transform, it can be shown that the Feynman
propagator distribution for photons has the following form:
Dμν
F = −ημν
4π2 ·
1
x2 + 0+i,
μ, ν = 0, 1, 2, 3.
This is a tempered distribution on the space-time R4 which is deﬁned as (13.56).
Here, we have to replace p2 = (p0)2 −p2 by x2 = t2 −x2.
Fundamental solutions. For a linear diﬀerential operator L with constant
coeﬃcients, consider the equation
LU = δ
in the sense of tempered distributions. Each solution U is called a tempered funda-
mental solution of L. Interestingly enough, the Feynman propagators for photons
and electrons are tempered fundamental solutions of the wave equation and the
Dirac equation, up to normalization factors. Explicitly, we get the following:
(i) The Feynman propagator distribution for the wave equation: 2 GF = −iδ.
(ii) The Feynman propagator distribution for the Klein-Gordon equation with mass
m > 0: (2 + m2) GF,m = −iδ.
(iii) The Feynman propagator distribution for photons: 2 Dμν
F
= iημνδ. Here, the
indices μ, ν run from 0 to 3.
(iv) The Feynman propagator distribution for electrons:
(iγμ∂μ −me)SF = iIδ.
13.4.4 Classical Wave Propagation versus Feynman Propagator
Propagation of quantum eﬀects diﬀers substantially from classical physics.
Folklore
The Feynman propagator distribution GF for the wave equation allows the following
representation:
GF = Gret −G−= Gadv + G+.
This shows that the Feynman propagator distribution diﬀers from both the clas-
sical retarded propagator distribution Gret and the classical advanced propagator
distribution Gadv of the wave equation. This tells us that

13.4 Feynman Propagators
871
Quantum wave propagation governed by the Feynman propagator distribu-
tion diﬀers from classical wave propagation.
Let us discuss this. The tempered distributions Gret, Gadv, G± can be characterized
by their Fourier–Minkowski transforms:
FMGret =

and
FMG± = ±θ(±p0)
2π
δ(p2).
(13.57)
These symbols are to be understood in the following way. The limit ε →+0 refers
to the convergence of tempered distributions. Explicitly, for all test functions ψ in
the function space S(R4), we get
FMGret(ψ) =
1

along with the spherical mean value
Mr(ψ) :=
Z
|p|=r
ψ(p, p0)dSr.
Here, dSr refers to the surface measure on the sphere of radius r in the p-space. Let
us discuss in which sense the symbol (13.57) (taken from the language of physicists)
implies mnemonically the formula (13.58). To begin with, let a > 0. Recall the
formula
δ(a2 −x2) = δ(x −a)
2a
+ δ(x + a)
2a
,
x ∈R
(see Sect. 11.2.4 of Vol. I). Hence
δ(p2) = δ((p0)2 −|p|2) = p0 −|p|
2p0
+ p0 + |p|
2p0
.
To compute the integral
Gret(ψ) =
Z
R4
θ(p0)
2π δ(p2)ψ(p) d4p,
we use spherical coordinates, that is, d4p = dp0(r2drdΩ) with r := |p| and the solid
angle Ω. Then, Gret(ψ) is equal to

light cone
L = L+ ∪L−
with the forward light cone L+ := {(x, t) ∈R4 :

Let us now explain the meaning of the tempered distributions Gret, Gadv, G± in
terms of fundamental solutions of the wave equation.
(i) The retarded propagator distribution: There exists precisely one tempered dis-
tribution Gret ∈S′(R4) such that the wave equation
2 Gret = −iδ
on R4
is satisﬁed, and the support of Gret is contained in the forward light cone L+.
Explicitly,
Gret = θ(t)

(ii) The advanced propagator distribution: By the time reﬂection t →−t, the
retarded propagator distribution, Gret, is transformed into the advanced prop-
agator distribution, Gadv ∈S′(R4). This tempered distribution is uniquely
determined by the fact that the wave equation
2 Gadv = −iδ
on R4
is satisﬁed, and the support of Gadv is contained in the backward light cone
L−. Explicitly,
Gadv = θ(−t)

This means that

G = sgn t
2πi δ(x2).
Using the tempered distributions G+ and G−, it turns out that
G = G+ + G−.
(13.60)
Furthermore, 2G± = 2G = 0 on R4. The two decompositions (13.59) and
(13.60) of the Jordan–Pauli function G are dual to each other in terms of the
Fourier–Minkowski transform. This is to be understood in the sense of the
formulas
Gret = θ(t)
2πi δ(x2),
Gadv = θ(−t)
2πi
δ(x2)
and the following formulas for the Fourier–Minkowski transform
FMG± = ±θ(±p0)
2π
δ(p2).
We are speaking of propagator duality. The decomposition
GF = Gret −G−= Gadv + G+
shows that the Feynman propagator GF is obtained by mixing of propagator
duality.
Perspectives. The Feynman propagators play a fundamental role in the ap-
proaches to quantum ﬁeld theory by using
• the Dyson S-matrix operator,

13. The Interacting Quantum Field and the Dyson Series
• the method of moments (Green’s functions and the LSZ reduction formalism),
and
• the Feynman functional integral.
These three apparently diﬀerent methods are indeed equivalent. This will be thor-
oughly studied in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics.
Historical remarks The role of highly singular Green functions for linear
hyperbolic partial diﬀerential equations was systematically studied by Hadamard
(regularization of divergent integrals) and Marcel Riesz (method of analytic con-
tinuation). For this, we recommend:

Diﬀerential Equations, Hermann, Paris, 1932 (in French).

14. The Beauty of Feynman Diagrams in QED
Whoever understands Feynman diagrams can understand everything in
quantum ﬁeld theory.
Folklore
In elementary particle physics, physicists use the highly intuitive language of Feyn-
man diagrams as a universal tool. It is crucial to know that the geometric Feynman
diagrams come from well-deﬁned analytic expressions generated by applying the
Wick theorem to the Dyson series.
The Feynman rules translate the Feynman diagrams into the corresponding
analytic expressions and vice versa.
The following section is crucial for understanding the language of physicists used in
elementary particle physics. The simple basic idea behind Feynman diagrams can
be found in Sect. 13.2. We are going now to consider the general case.
For the convenience of the reader, we will only use expressions which are
well-deﬁned in terms of mathematics.
However, the notation is chosen in such a way that our language is very close to
the language used by physicists. For mnemonical reasons, physicists do not hesitate
to use ill-deﬁned formulas like divergent integrals and the square, δ(x)2, of Dirac’s
delta function. In Sect. 12.6.1 of Vol. I, we have shown that it is impossible to deﬁne
a reasonable product for all distributions (the counterexample of Laurent Schwartz).
However, based on the principle of causality and the notion of the wave front set,
there exists a subclass of distributions for which the product is well deﬁned. This
is the starting point of the Epstein–Glaser approach to quantum electrodynamics.
The computation of scattering processes on the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ] is governed
by the transition probabilities
W(T) := |⟨Φout|S(T)Φin⟩|2.
(14.1)
To this end, we have to compute the transition amplitude
⟨Φout|S(T)Φin⟩.
Recall from Sect. 13.1 that, in Nth order approximation, Dyson’s S-matrix
S(T) = I +
N
X
n=1
Sn(T)
is given by S1(T) :=
R T/2

and
V(x) := ieψ(x)γμAμ(x)ψ(x).
Here, ψ, Aμ denote free ﬁelds, and x = (x, t). Moreover, the electron has the electric
charge −e.1 In general, incoming particles are described by the following normalized
states
Φin = (a+

which correspond to photons, electrons, and positrons. Similar expressions are used
for Φout. For the transition amplitude, we get
⟨0| . . . S(T) . . . |0⟩
(14.2)
where . . . represent products of creation operators for incoming and outgoing par-
ticles.
Perturbation theory uses the approximation I+S1+. . .+SN of the S-matrix
S in Nth order.
For computing physical processes via Feynman diagrams, the crucial Feynman rules
are summarized in Table 14.5 on page 897. In this chapter, we explain how these
very convenient Feynman rules arise from the Dyson series by applying the Wick
theorem. For example, this should help the reader to understand the appearance
and the size of the appropriate symmetry factors.
14.1 Compton Eﬀect and Feynman Rules in Position
Space
The transition amplitudes (14.2) are computed by means of the Main Wick Theorem
13.2 on page 846. This leads to the Feynman rules from Table 14.5 on page 897.
To illustrate this, let us consider a typical example, namely, the scattering process
between one photon and one electron (Compton scattering) in second order. In this
case, the normalized incoming state
Φin := a+
p,sb+
q,σ|0⟩
consists of one photon having the momentum vector p and the polarization number
s = 1, 2, along with one electron having the momentum vector q and the spin
number σ = ± 1
2. Similarly, the normalized outgoing state
1 Recall that, by our convention (10.17), we work in the energetic system of phys-
ical units, that is, c = ℏ= ε0 = μ0 = 1. Using the notation introduced in Sect.
13.1, we have V(t) = −iHint.

14.1 Compton Eﬀect and Feynman Rules in Position Space
877
Φout := a+
p′,s′b+
q′,σ′|0⟩
consists of one photon having the momentum vector p′ and the polarization num-
ber s′ = 1, 2, along with one electron having the momentum vector q′ and the
spin number σ′ = ± 1
2. In order to simplify notation in the following, we suppress
polarization and spin indices, that is, we write
a+
p , a−
p′, b+
q , b−
q′
instead of a+
p,s, a−
p′,s′, b+
q,σ, b−
q′,σ′, respectively. We also write S instead of S(T). It is
our goal to compute the following transition amplitude
τ := ⟨Φout|SΦin⟩= ⟨0|a−
p′b−
q′Sa+
p b+
q |0⟩.
In second-order approximation, we get
τ = ⟨0|a−
p′b−
q′(I + S1 + S2)a+
p b+
q |0⟩.
Here, we set S0 := I along with
S1 :=
Z
Ω
d4x : ieψ(x)γμAμ(x)ψ(x) :
and
S2 := 1
2T
Z
Ω×Ω
d4xd4y : ieψ(x)γμAμ(x)ψ(x) : : ieψ(y)γνAν(y)ψ(y) : .
Here, Ω := [−T
2 , T
2 ]×C(L), and x = (t, x). Furthermore, d4x = dt d3x. The operator
T organizes the time ordering of the integrand. Let us compute the single terms.
(i) Zero-order approximation: Naturally enough, we assume that the incoming par-
ticles are diﬀerent from the outgoing particles. Hence
⟨Φout|Φin⟩= 0.
This implies τ0 := ⟨0|a−
p′b−
q′S0a+
p b+
q |0⟩= 0.
(ii) First-order approximation: Since S1 represents an operator product of three
factors ψ, Aμ, ψ, the transition amplitude
τ1 := ⟨0|a−
p′b−
q′S1a+
p b+
q |0⟩
contains an operator product of 2 + 3 + 2 factors. This is an odd number.
Therefore, τ1 = 0, by the Main Wick Theorem 13.2 on page 846.
(iii) Second-order approximation: Again by the Main Wick Theorem 13.2, the tran-
sition amplitude
τ2 := ⟨0|a−
p′b−
q′S2a+
p b+
q |0⟩
can be represented as the sum
τ2 = 1
2(τ21 + τ22 + τ23 + τ24)
on pairings. This is represented graphically in Table 14.1(a)–(d) on page 879
by using the conventions introduced in Table 14.5 on page 897.

14. The Beauty of Feynman Diagrams in QED
Let us discuss this. Using the formula
τ2j := −e2
Z
Ω×Ω
ρ2j(x, y)d4xd4y,
j = 1, 2, 3, 4,
(14.3)
we get the following expressions:
(a) Transition amplitude τ21 (Table 14.1(a)):
ϱ21 := ⟨0|a−
p′b−
q′ : ψ(x)γμAμ(x)ψ(x) : : ψ(y)γνAν(y)ψ(y) : a+
p b+
q |0⟩.
(b) Transition amplitude τ22 (Table 14.1(b)):
ϱ22 := ⟨0|a−
p′b−
q′ : ψ(x)γμAμ(x)ψ(x) : : ψ(y)γνAν(y)ψ(y) : a+
p b+
q |0⟩.
(c) Transition amplitude τ23 (Table 14.1(c)):
ϱ23 := ⟨0|a−
p′b−
q′ : ψ(x)γμAμ(x)ψ(x) : : ψ(y)γνAν(y)ψ(y) : a+
p b+
q |0⟩.
(d) Transition amplitude τ24 (Table 14.1(d)):
ϱ24 := ⟨0|a−
p′b−
q′ : ψ(x)γμAμ(x)ψ(x) : : ψ(y)γνAν(y)ψ(y) : a+
p b+
q |0⟩.
The symbols from (a)–(d) above are obtained systematically in the following way:
• Use only the pairings ψψ, ψψ,
a−A, A a+, and b−ψ, ψb+ (see page 880).
• Consider all completely paired expressions.
The Feynman graphs from Table 14.1(a)–(d) on page 879 are in one-to-one cor-
respondence to the analytical expressions (a)–(d) above. This method is a universal
one. It applies to all kinds of Feynman diagrams in quantum electrodynamics.
Justiﬁcation. The key result is the Main Wick Theorem 13.2 on page 846.
The pairings of ϱ21 are to be understood in the following sense:
ϱ21(x, y) = b−
q′ψ(x)γμa−
p′Aμ(x)ψ(x)ψ(y)γνAν(y)a+
p ψ(y)b+
q .
Here, we use the time-ordered contractions deﬁned by
B(x)D(y) = B(x)D(y) := CT (B(x)D(y)) = ⟨0|T (B(x)D(y))|0⟩.
Furthermore, we obtain the following product of time-ordered contractions:

Since γμ, ψ, ψ are matrices, one has to read these equations with care. In fact, in
order to get the explicit expressions one has to use components. This will be done
below.
Furthermore, note that symmetry substantially simpliﬁes the computation of
Feynman diagrams. As we will show below, we have

880
14. The Beauty of Feynman Diagrams in QED
τ23 = τ12,
τ24 = τ22.
(14.4)
Hence
τ = τ21 + τ22.
Thus, one has only to consider the Feynman diagrams (a) and (b) in Table 14.1 on
page 879. This is the basic idea behind normal forms of Feynman diagrams. The
proof of (14.4) is an immediate consequence of the symmetry relations
ϱ23(x, y) = ϱ21(y, x),
ϱ23(x, y) = ϱ22(y, x).
(14.5)
Mnemonically, this follows from interchanging x with y and using
ψ(x)ψ(y) = −ψ(y)ψ(x).
Intuitively, this reﬂects symmetry properties of the graphs from Table 14.1 on page
879, as will be discussed below.
Time-ordered pairings. It remains to discuss Table 14.5 on page 897. As a
typical example, let us show that
ψβ(x)b+
q,s = ⟨0|ψβ(x)b+
q,s|0⟩= Nquq,sei(qx−Eqt).
Proof. For the free electron ﬁeld, we have the expression
ψ(x) :=

q∈G(N),s=± 1
2
(b−
q,suq,s ei(qx−Eqt) + c+
q,svq,s e−i(qx−Eqt)) Nq
with x = (x, t). It follows from the anticommutation relation
b−
q,sb+
q,s = I −b+
q,sb−
q,s
along with b−
q,s|0⟩= 0 that
⟨0|b−
q,sb+
q,s|0⟩= ⟨0|I|0⟩⟨0|0⟩= 1.
If (q′, s′) ̸= (q, s), then
b−
q′,s′b+
q,s = −b+
q,sb−
q′,s′.
Hence ⟨0|b−
q′,s′b+
q,s|0⟩= 0. Finally, c−
q′,s′|0⟩= 0 and (c+)†
q′,s′ = c−
q′,s for all q′, s′
implies that
⟨0|c+
q′,s′b+
q,s|0⟩= ⟨(c−
q′,s′|0⟩)|b+
q,s|0⟩= 0.
2
Similarly, we obtain the other expressions from Table 14.5 on 897. In addition,
observe the following peculiarities. By the Main Wick Theorem 13.2 on page 846,
we have to take all the completely paired expressions into account. However, some
of them vanish. In particular, the following pairings drop out:
• pairings between bosons and fermions, ψA, Aψ, ψA, Aψ;
• pairings inside a normal product, ψ(x)ψ(x);
• the pairings ψ(x)ψ(y) and ψ(x)ψ(y);
• pairings between creation and annihilation operators corresponding to diﬀerent
particles.
Therefore, only the time-ordered pairings listed in Table 14.5 on page 897 have to
be taken into account.

14.2 Symmetry Properties
881
14.2 Symmetry Properties
It happens quite naturally that diﬀerent graphs yield the same transition ampli-
tudes, by symmetry. This simpliﬁes the computation of transition amplitudes. To
explain this, let us show that
τ23 = τ21.
(14.6)
This is a consequence of the symmetry property (14.5) and the fact that the integral
(14.3) is invariant under a permutation of x and y. To prove (14.5), observe that
ϱ21(x, y) is equal to
−b−
q′ψα(x)(γμ)αβa−
p′Aμ(x)ψβ(x)ψκ(y)(γν)κλAν(y)a+
p ψλ(y)b+
q .
By Table 14.5 on page 897, we get the following key relation
ψβ(x)ψκ(y) = −ψκ(y)ψβ(x).
On the other hand, ϱ23(x, y) is equal to
−b−
q′ψλ(y)(γμ)αβAμ(x)a+
p ψα(x)ψλ(y)(γν)κλa−
p′Aν(y)ψβ(x)b+
q .
Changing variables,
x ⇔y,
μ ⇔ν,
α ⇔κ,
β ⇔λ,
we get the desired relation ϱ21(x, y) = ϱ23(y, x). Similarly, we obtain
τ24 = τ21.
Physical intuition. Table 14.1(a) on page 879 represents
• an incoming photon and an incoming electron at the vertex y,
• an outgoing photon and an outgoing electron at the vertex x, and
• a virtual electron moving from y to x.
Furthermore, Table 14.1(c) on page 879 describes
• an incoming photon and an incoming electron at the vertex x,
• an outgoing photon and an outgoing electron at the vertex y, and
• a virtual electron moving from x to y.
This is precisely Table 14.1(a) on page 879 by interchanging the role of the vertices
x and y. Since the two Feynman diagrams from Table 14.1(a) and Table 14.1(c)
describe the same physical situation, we expect that the corresponding transition
amplitudes coincide. Our rigorous proof for τ23 = τ12 given above shows that this
is indeed true.
Similarly, the two Feynman diagrams from Table 14.1(b) and Table 14.1(d)
represent the same physical situation. Therefore, we may restrict ourselves to the
normal forms from Table 14.1(a) and Table 14.1(b) by counting them twice.

hilation operators for electrons by creation and annihilation operators for positrons,

then electron-photon scattering passes over to positron-photon scattering. From Ta-
ble 14.1 on page 879 we obtain Table 14.2. Here, the external electrons are replaced
by external positrons, by simply reversing the arrows. Mnemonically, physicists say
that:
Positrons are electrons running backward in time.
This very fruitful idea was introduced by Stueckelberg in the 1940s and extensively
used by Feynman in connection with Feynman diagrams.
In order to avoid any ambiguities, we always read Feynman diagrams from
right to left corresponding to increasing time.

Space
It is worth noting that the notation facilitates discovery. This, in a most
wonderful way, reduces the mind’s labors.

14.3 Summary of the Feynman Rules in Momentum Space
883
Let us consider the Feynman diagrams of quantum electrodynamics in nth order
of perturbation theory. We want to study a ﬁxed scattering process for given in-
coming and outgoing particles. As a prototype think of electron-photon scattering
(Compton eﬀect) from Table 14.1 on page 879. To ﬁx the terminology, we put the
physical system into a ﬁnite cubic box C(L) of side length L and volume2
V = L3.
The discrete volume element of the 3-dimensional momentum space is equal to
Δ3p = (2π)3
V
.
Let us observe the given scattering process during the time interval [−T

length T.

Construct all possible combinations in such a way that all the processes are

particles. This construction corresponds to all possible complete pairings of the
form
⟨0|a−b−... : ψ(x1) ̸A(x1)ψ(x1) : · · · : ψ(xn) ̸A(xn)ψ(xn) : a+b+... |0⟩,
similarly as in (14.3). By convention, the diagrams have to be read from right
to left for increasing time.
(ii) Normal forms: Two Feynman diagrams from (i) are called equivalent iﬀthey
represent the same physical situation (up to a permutation of the vertices).
Select a complete family of inequivalent Feynman diagrams in a ﬁxed, but
otherwise arbitrary manner. The members of this family are called the normal
forms of the Feynman diagrams from (i). To each normal form, assign the factor
m
n! ,
where m is the multiplicity of the normal form (i.e., the number of correspond-
ing equivalent Feynman diagrams). As a rule, m = n!. If there exist internal
symmetries of the normal form, than the multiplicity m can be less than n!.

(x1, x2, x3) ∈R3 with |xj| ≤L for j = 1, 2, 3. The grid G(N) in 3-dimensional
momentum space consists of all the momentum vectors

where m1, m2, m3 are integers with |mj| ≤N for j = 1, 2, 3, and Δp := 2π/L.

Justiﬁcation of the Feynman rules. These rules are a simple consequence
of the rules from Table 14.5 on page 897 by carrying out the integrations in position
space. These integrations produce the discrete Dirac delta functions at the vertices.
The typical argument can be found in the proof of Example 14.3 on page 888.
Furry’s rule allows us to reduce positron lines to electron lines (plus an ad-
ditional sign). This rule depends on both the main Wick theorem and symmetry
properties for the trace of products of Dirac matrices. The proof of Fury’s rule will
be given in Problem 15.13.
14.4 Typical Examples
In terms of physics, Feynman propagators describe the propagation of
physical eﬀects in quantum ﬁeld theory by taking both causality and an-
tiparticles into account.
In terms of mathematics, Feynman propagators are distinguished funda-
mental solutions of the wave equation, the Klein–Gordon equation, and
the Dirac equation. In the Fourier space, Feynman propagators are inverse
diﬀerential operators, after regularization.

Let us illustrate the Feynman rules by considering some examples.

Fig. 14.2. Crossing symmetry of Compton scattering
Example 14.1 (electron-photon scattering – Compton scattering). We are given
• an incoming photon with momentum vector p and polarization number r = 1, 2,
• an incoming electron with momentum vector q and spin number s = ± 1
2,
• an outgoing photon with momentum vector p and polarization number r′ = 1, 2,
• and an outgoing electron with momentum vector q′ and spin number s′ = ± 1
2.
We assume that the incoming particles are diﬀerent from the outgoing particles.
By momentum conservation and energy conservation, we get
p′ + q′ = p + q,
ωp′ + Eq′ = ωp + Eq.
The normal forms of the corresponding Feynman diagrams are pictured in Fig. 14.2.
Following the convention introduced by Dirac, the symbol
⟨p′, r′; q′, s′|S(T)|p, r; q, s⟩
stands for the following transition amplitude:
⟨0|a−

In second-order approximation, the transition amplitude
τ := ⟨p′, r′; q′, s′|I + S1(T) + S2(T) |p, r; q, s⟩
of Compton scattering is given by τ = τ21 + τ22 where

The integrand f22 is obtained from f21 by using the transformation

Intuitively, the incoming (resp. outgoing) photon is interchanged with an outgoing
(resp. incoming) photon. This symmetry property of the Feynman diagram depicted
in Fig. 14.2 above is called crossing symmetry.

The point is that this formal translation is nice from the mnemonical point of view,
but it leads frequently to meaningless expressions. Physicists repair this defect by
using the method of renormalization theory.
Concerning (14.12), the following comment is in order. Laurent Schwartz proved
in 1954 that the square of the Dirac delta function does not exist as a distribution.
As a standard tool in scattering theory, formula (14.12) is used by physicists in a
mnemonic manner. We will show below that this formula is a consequence of our
rigorous lattice approach.
14.6 Transition Probabilities and Cross Sections of
Scattering Processes
Physicists measure real numbers in experiments. The theory has to predict
these numbers.
Folklore
In particle accelerators, physicists measure cross sections of scattering processes.
We want to show how cross sections can be computed by using Feynman diagrams.
The idea is to compute ﬁrst the transition amplitudes by means of the Feynman
rules. This way, we get the transition probabilities which imply the cross sections
in a quite natural manner. Let us illustrate this by investigating electron-photon
scattering (Compton eﬀect).
We consider a ﬁxed inertial system with the right-handed orthonormal basis
i, j, k.
Compton eﬀect. Let us consider electron-photon scattering in the following
special situation (Fig. 14.3):
• We work in the rest system of the incoming electron, i.e., we set q = 0. We
assume that the resting electron has the spin vector sℏk with the spin number
s = ± 1
2. The rest energy of the electron is equal to mec2. Since we work in the
energetic system, ℏ= c = 1.
• The incoming photon moves with the velocity c from right to left along the x-axis.
The photon has the momentum vector p = −pi with p > 0, the energy ωp = p,
and the transversal polarization vector er with r = 1, 2. Here, the vectors e1, e2,
and p/|p| form a right-handed orthonormal system.
• The incoming photon scatters the resting electron. The scattered (outgoing) elec-
tron has the momentum vector q′, the energy
Eq′ =
p
q′2 + m2e,
and the spin vector s′ℏk with the spin number s′ = ± 1
2.

892
14. The Beauty of Feynman Diagrams in QED
• The outgoing photon has the momentum vector p′, the energy ωp′, and the po-
larization vector e′
r′ with the polarization number r′ = 1, 2. The vectors e′
1′, e′
2′,
and p′/|p′| form a right-handed orthonormal system. By deﬁnition, the scatter-
ing angle ϑ is the angle between the momentum vector p of the incoming photon
and the momentum vector p′ of the outgoing photon where −π
2 ≤ϑ ≤π
2 (Fig.
14.3 above). Our ﬁnal goal is the Klein–Nishina formula for the cross section of
the Compton scattering to be considered in (15.1) on page 899.
By conservation of momentum and energy, we get
p′ + q′ = p,
Eq′ + ωp′ = me + ωp.
(14.13)
For the energy ωp′ of the scattered photon, we obtain the key relation
ωp′ =
ωp
1 + η(1 −cos ϑ)
(14.14)
with η := (ωp/me). Here, ϑ denotes the scattering angle of the photon (Fig. 14.3
above). Indeed, for the energy of the scattered electron, we obtain
E2
q′ = (me + ωp −ωp′)2 = m2
e + 2me(ωp −ωp′) + (ωp −ωp′)2
and
E2
q′ = m2
e + q′2 = m2
e(p −p′)2 = m2
e + ω2
p + ω2
p′ −2ωpωp′ cos ϑ.
Hence ωpωp′(1 −cos ϑ) = me(ωp −ωp′).
Note that we investigate the scattering process in a cubic box C(L) of length
L and volume V = L3 during the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ].6 Moreover, the lattice in
momentum space is chosen in such a way that there exists a maximal momentum
Pmax with
|p| ≤Pmax
for all
p ∈G(N).
Recall that in Sect. 12.4.3 the construction of the creation operators
a+
p,r, b+
q,s, a+
p′,r′, b+
q′,s′
for the photons and electrons depends on the choice of the box C(L). By deﬁnition,
the state
a+
p,r|0⟩
represents precisely the situation where one photon of momentum vector p and
polarization number r is in the box C(L).
Cross section. In a physical experiment, we consider a ﬁxed resting electron
and a homogeneous stream of identical incoming photons described by the current
density
jin := cϱ
with the velocity of light, c = 1, and the particle density
ϱ := Nin
V .
That is, there are Nin identical photons with momentum vector p and polarization
number r in the box C(L). Let Nout be the number of scattered photons during the
time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. Deﬁne
6 The volume V of the box is called the normalization volume.

14.6 Transition Probabilities and Cross Sections of Scattering Processes
893
σ(V, T, Pmax) := Nout
TVjin .
This number has the physical dimension of area (in the SI system); it is called
the cross section of the scattering process, by physicists. This yields the mnemonic
formula
Nout = σ(V, T, Pmax) · TVjin.
Transition probability. By deﬁnition, the real number
W(T) := |⟨p′, r′; q′, s′|I + S1(T) + S2(T)|p, s; 0, s⟩|2
is called the transition probability of the scattering process during the time interval
[−T
2 , T
2 ]. Since the contributions of I and S1 drop out, we get
W(T) := |⟨p′, r′; q′, s′|S2(T)|p, r; 0, s⟩|2.
For the number of outgoing photons, we obtain
Nout =

to the number of particle states in the corresponding region of the phase space. In
addition, note that, in the case of Nout, we have to take both the outgoing photons
and electrons into account. Recall that h = 2πℏ= 2π in the energetic system.

14.7 The Crucial Limits
Naturally enough, we consider the following three limits:
L →+∞,
Pmax →+∞,
T →+∞.
(14.17)
That is, the box C(L) becomes the 3-dimensional space R3 (i.e., the normalization
volume V = L3 becomes inﬁnite), the maximal momentum Pmax becomes inﬁnite,
and we observe the scattering process over the inﬁnite time interval ]−∞, ∞[. From
the physical point of view, we will regard the following three limits:
(H) High-energy limit: Pmax →+∞.
(L) Low-energy-limit: Δ3p = (2π)3
V
→0.
(T) Long-time limit: T →+∞.
In addition, we will carry out the following two limits:
(RE) Regularization of the electron propagator: ε →+0.
(RP) Regularization of the photon propagator: mph →+0 (the virtual photon
mass goes to zero).
The asymptotic cross section. The cross section σ(V, T, Pmax) depends on
the volume V of the box, the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ], and the maximal momentum
Pmax. To free ourselves from this arbitrary choice, we consider the limit (14.17),
and we deﬁne the asymptotic cross section by
σ :=
lim
V,T,Pmax→+∞
σ(V, T, Pmax)
VT
.
For physical reasons, we expect that this limit exists, at least in some generalized
sense.

Naturally enough, we average over the two possible spin positions, s = ± 1
2, of the
resting electron, and we sum over the two possible spin positions, s′ = ± 1
2, of the
scattered electron. Observe that the asymptotic cross section, σ, s is independent
of both the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ] and the normalization volume V, as expected by
physicists.
Motivation. We will use conservation of energy and momentum from (14.13)
along with formal arguments based on the calculus for Dirac’s delta function. By
(14.10) and (14.16), as T →+∞, we get

Here, the functions f, g : [0, ∞] →R are smooth, and we assume that the positive
number x0 is the only zero of the function f (see Sect. 11.2.4 of Vol. I). By (14.14),
the equation f(ωp′) = 0 has the unique solution
ωp′ =
1
1 + (ωp/me)(1 −cos ϑ).
For the derivative,
f ′(ωp′) = Eq′ + ωp′ −ωp cos ϑ
Eq′
= ωp + me −ωp cos ϑ
Eq′
= ωpme
Eq′ωp′ .
Now the claim (14.18) follows from (14.19).

15. Applications to Physical Eﬀects
We want to apply the method of Feynman diagrams to the following problems:
• the scattering of electrons and photons (Compton eﬀect);
• scattering of particles in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld;
• the spontaneous emission of photons by atoms, and
• the Cherenkov eﬀect.
According to our convention formulated on page 790, we will work in the energetic
system with c = ℏ= ε0 = μ0 := 1.
15.1 Compton Eﬀect
The Compton eﬀect lies at the heart of modern physics.
Folklore
Let us consider the scattering process between a resting electron and a homogenous
stream of incoming photons. We use the notation introduced in Sect. 14.6. The
goal is to compute the relation between the (asymptotic) cross section σ and the
scattering angle ϑ for the photon (see Fig. 14.3 on page 891). By convention, we
choose −π
2 ≤ϑ ≤π
2 . Then
dΩ = 2π cos ϑ dϑ
represents the surface measure diﬀerential on the unit sphere.
The Klein–Nishina formula. For the (asymptotic) cross section of the Comp-
ton eﬀect in second order of perturbation theory, we get
σ =

This 1929 Klein–Nishina formula is one of the most beautiful formulas in quantum
electrodynamics which goes beyond the classical theory of electromagnetism based
on the Maxwell equations. In particular, α = 1/137.04 is the ﬁne structure constant,
me is the electron mass, and re = α/me is the so-called classical electron radius
which will be discussed below. The relation between the energies ωp and ωp′ of the
incoming and outgoing photons, respectively, is given by
ωp′ =
ωp
1 + η(1 −cos ϑ).

Fig. 15.1. Cross section for the Compton eﬀect
Here, the dimensionless parameter η := ωp/me is the ratio between the energy of
the incoming photon and the energy of the resting electron. By convention, the total
cross section σ averages over both the spin of the electrons and the polarization of
the photons. Naturally enough, we write
dσ
dΩ = f(ϑ).
The diﬀerential dσ = f(ϑ)dΩ is called the diﬀerential cross section of the Compton
eﬀect. Explicitly,

is a classical formula which was obtained by John Thompson (1856–1940) at the
end of the 19th century based on the Maxwell equations.2 For the scattering of
a photon stream, this formula tells us the fundamental result that the electron
behaves approximately like a disc of radius re given by
re := α
me = αλC = αλC
2π .
Therefore, about 1900, the quantity re was coined the classical electron radius.
Moreover, λC := 2π/m (resp. λC = 1/me) is called the Compton wavelength (resp.
the reduced Compton wavelength) of the electron. In the SI system,

Here, q′ = p −p′ is the momentum vector of the scattered electron. Explicitly, the
left-hand side of (15.2) contains thousands of terms. Therefore, we need a clever
method for computing this expression. In this connection, physicists invented the
elegant trace method for Dirac matrices.

outgoing photon. Explicitly, we choose

ep,2 = ep,1 × p

15.1.1 Duality between Light Waves and Light Particles in the
History of Physics
Light represents the most important physical phenomenon. The experimental and
theoretical investigation of light has played a fundamental role in the historical
development of physics and mathematics. The light of our sun is also fundamental
for the existence of life on earth. Laser light helps in medicine and high technology.
For studying the properties of our universe, we rely on analyzing the spectrum of
the light coming from stars, galaxies, and distant quasars.
The principle of least action. The reﬂection law of light was deduced by
Heron of Alexandria (100 B.C.). In 1636, there appeared the seminal book Discourse
sur la m´ethode de bien conduire sa raison by Descartes (1596–1650).3 Among other
subjects, Descartes’ Discourse treated analytic geometry and dioptrics. Motivated
by Descartes’ book, Fermat (1601–1665) invented his principle of shortest time for
light rays; he used this principle in order to derive Descartes’ principle for the
refraction of light.
(i) Light as a wave: In his book on the foundations of optics, Trait´e de la lumi`ere,
Huygens (1629–1695) had the ingenious idea of replacing Fermat’s long-range
principle for the propagation of light by a contact principle. In particular,
Huygens postulated that light consists of waves.4
(ii) Light as particles: Newton (1643–1727) showed that Huygens’ wave concept
contradicts physical experiments. Therefore, Newton postulated that light con-
sists of particles.5
(iii) Diﬀraction of light: Experimentally, if light passes through a small slit, interfer-
ence patterns are observed on a screen behind the slit (i.e., the light intensity
on the screen varies from point to point). The diﬀraction of light was thor-
oughly studied from the experimental and theoretical point of view by Fresnel
(1788–1827). He convinced physicists that light possesses a wave character.
(iv) The duality between waves and particles: From the modern point of view,
light is a quantum phenomenon. Light quanta are quantum states described
by vectors in an appropriate Hilbert space. Quanta possess features of both
waves and particles. This is the ﬁnal answer to the question about the nature
of light. In quantum electrodynamics, we start with a classical wave theory
based on the Maxwell equations. We add the particle picture by quantizing the
classical wave theory with the help of creation and annihilation operators.
3 In the same year, 1636, the oldest university of the United States of America,
the Harvard University, was founded in Cambridge near Boston, Massachusetts.
4 In about 1870, Lie (1842–1899) created the mathematical theory of contact trans-
formations which represents a far-reaching generalization of Huygens’ ideas in
terms of mathematics.
5 At Newton’s time, the concept of transversal vector waves was not known to
physicists. Newton’s argument only excluded longitudinal waves.

15.1 Compton Eﬀect
903
In 1744, Euler (1707–1783) founded the calculus of variations as a far-reaching
mathematical generalization of Fermat’s principle of shortest time for light. La-
grange (1736–1813) extended this to multidimensional integrals. Based on the work
of Fermat, Leibniz, Maupertius, Euler, and Lagrange, the ﬁnal form of the principle
of least action was formulated by Hamilton (1805–1865).
The idea of physical ﬁelds. Gauss (1777–1855) based his theory of mag-
netism on long-range forces, similarly to Newton’s long-range forces in gravitation.
Faraday (1791–1867) created the ingenious idea of an electromagnetic ﬁeld; this
way, he replaced Gauss’ long-range electromagnetic forces by a contact principle.6
Faraday’s notion of physical ﬁelds is crucial for modern physics.
Based on his fundamental equations for electromagnetism from 1864, Maxwell
(1831–1879) postulated that light consists of transversal waves of the electromag-
netic ﬁeld. Electromagnetic waves were experimentally established by Heinrich
Hertz (1857–1894), shortly after Maxwell’s death. In the second half of the 19th
century, John Thomson (1856–1940) experimentally proved the existence of the
electron, and he computed the classical cross section for the scattering of electro-
magnetic waves (light) based on Maxwell’s equations.
Light quanta. In 1900, Planck (1858–1947) formulated his famous law for the
energy spectrum of black-body radiation. To this end, Planck postulated that the
energy of light is quantized. In 1905, Einstein (1879–1955) explained the photoelec-
tric eﬀect by postulating the existence of light quanta;7 this way, Einstein could
derive Planck’s radiation law by the methods of statistical physics. In 1917, Ein-
stein formulated his stochastic theory for the emission of light quanta in molecules;
this is the basis for modern laser physics.8 In 1922, the Compton eﬀect was ex-
perimentally discovered by Compton (1892–1962). The Klein–Nishina cross section
formula for the Compton eﬀect was obtained in 1929.9 For their contributions to
the physics of electrons and light, John Thomson, Planck, Einstein, and Compton
were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in the years 1906, 1918, 1921, and 1927,
respectively.
Quantum electrodynamics was founded in the late 1940s by Feynman (1918–
1979), Schwinger (1918–1994), and Tomonaga (1906–1979); these three physicists
were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1965.

Computation of cross sections means computation of traces for products
of Dirac matrices.

6 In 1915, Einstein replaced Newton’s long-range gravitational forces by a contact
principle, in the framework of his theory of general relativity.
7 The notion of photon was coined by the physical chemist Gilbert Lewis in 1926.
8 LASER stands for Light Ampliﬁcation by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.
Laser beams were experimentally produced in about 1960. For their fundamental
work in the ﬁeld of quantum electronics (laser physics), Basov, Prokhorov, and
Townes were awarded the Nobel prize in physics in 1964.

is called the trace of the matrix A. In particular, for the (n × n)-unit matrix,
tr(I) = n. Let n = 1, 2, . . .
Proposition 15.1 For complex-valued (n × n) matrices A, B, A1, A2, . . ., the fol-
lowing properties are valid:
(i) Homogeneity: tr(αA) = α tr A for all complex numbers α.
(ii) Product property: tr(AB) = tr(BA).
(iii) Duality: (tr(A))† = tr(A†). The trace of a self-adjoint matrix is real.
(iv) Cyclic permutations: The trace of a matrix product is invariant under cyclic
permutations of the factors:
tr(A1A2A3 · · · AN) = tr(A2A3 · · · ANA1).
Moreover, (tr(A1A2A3 · · · AN))† = tr(A†
NA†
N−1 · · · A†

(v) Invariance: tr(SAS−1) = tr(A) for each invertible (n × n)-matrix S.
Trace rules for Dirac matrices. Let A, B, A1, A2 . . . be arbitrary complex
(4 × 4)-matrices, and let γ0, γ1 . . . γ5 be the Dirac matrices introduced in Sect. 11.1
on page 793. For j = 1, 2, 3, we have
γ0 = γ0,
γj = −γj,
̸A := γμAμ,
A := γ0A†γ0.
In contrast to this deﬁnition, we set ψ := ψ†γ0 for each complex column matrix ψ
which has four rows. The matrices A and ψ are called the Dirac adjoint of A and
ψ, respectively. Recall that γ5 := iγ0γ1γ2γ3.
Example 15.2 For all the indices μ, ν, κ, λ, μ1, μ2, . . . = 0, 1, 2, 3, the following are
met:
(a) (γ0)† = γ0 and (γj)† = −γj for j = 1, 2, 3.
(b) (γ)μ = γμ.
(c) We have the crucial Cliﬀord relation γμγν + γνγμ = 2ημν.
(d) γ5γμ = −γμγ5 and γ5γ5 = I.
(e) For N = 1, 2, 3, .., the following two Furry relations hold:10
tr(γμ1γμ2 · · · γμN ) = tr(γμN · · · γμ2γμ1),
and
tr(γμ1γμ2 · · · γμN ) = tr((−γμ1)(−γμ2) · · · (−γμN )).
(f) For odd N = 1, 3, 5, . . ., we have
tr(γμ1 · · · γμN ) = 0.
This key relation critically simpliﬁes the computation of cross sections.
(g) tr(γμγν) = 4ημν.
(h) For even N = 4, 6, . . ., the computation of the trace can be based on the
following recursive formula:
10 We will show in Problem 15.13 that the Furry relations are responsible for the
Furry rule.

N
X
r=2
(−1)r tr(γμ1γμr) · tr(γμ1 · · · γμr−1γμr+1 · · · γμN ).
For example, this yields
tr(γμγνγκγλ) = 4(ημνηκλ −ημκηνλ + ημληνκ).
(i) tr(γμγ5) = tr(γμγνγ5) = 0.
(j) For N = 3, 4, . . ., the computation of the trace can be based on the product
formula
γμγνγκ = ημνγκ −ημκγν + γνκγμ −iϵμνκσγσγ5.
For example, tr(γμγνγκγ5) = 0, and
tr(γμγνγκγλγ5) = −4iϵμνκλ.
In particular, tr(γ0γ1γ2γ3γ5) = −i tr(γ5γ5) = −i tr I = −4i.
(k) (tr A)† = tr A† = tr A.

(tr(A1A2 · · · AN))† = tr(A†

(m) AB = B · A.
The proof can be found in Problem 15.12 on page 942.
Trace rules for Feynman’s slash matrices. Let a = (a0, a1, a2, a3) and
b = (b0, b1, b2, b3) where all the numbers aμ, bν are real. We deﬁne11
̸a := aμγμ,
ab := aμbμ.
The following rules are critically used for computing cross sections in quantum ﬁeld
theory.
Proposition 15.3 (T1) Dirac duality: ̸a ≠a and ̸a ̸b ≠b ̸a.
(T2) Anticommutativity: We have the key relation12
̸a ̸b = 2ab−̸b ̸a.
(T3) Reversion and cyclic permutation: For N = 2, 3, . . . , we get
tr(̸a1 · · · ̸aN) = tr(̸aN · · · ̸a1).
In addition, the trace is invariant under cyclic permutations, that is,
tr(̸a1 · · · ̸aN−1 ̸aN) = tr(̸aN ̸a1 · · · ̸aN−1).
11 We sum over equal lower and upper indices from 0 to 3. For example,
ab =

matrix, I. Note that tr(I) = 4.

(T4) Odd number of factors: For odd N = 1, 3, 5, . . .,
tr(̸a1 · · · ̸aN) = 0.

(T5) Even number of factors: For two and four factors,
tr(̸a ̸b) = 4ab,
1
4 tr(̸a ̸b ̸c ̸d) = (ab)(cd) −(ac)(bd) + (ad)(bc).
Generally, for even N = 4, 6, 8, . . ., the trace tr(̸ a1 ̸ a2 · · · ̸ aN) is given by the key
reduction formula
N
X
r=2
(−1)r(̸a1 ̸ar) · tr(̸a2 · · · ̸ar−1 ̸ar+1 · · · ̸aN).
(T6) Square trick: If ̸ar ≠ar+1 for ﬁxed index r, then
tr(̸a1 · · · ̸ar ̸ar+1 · · · ̸aN) = a2
r tr(̸a1 · · · ̸ar−1 ̸ar+2 · · · ̸aN).
In particular, this trace vanishes if a2
r = 0.
(T7) Special reduction formula: For even N = 4, 6, 8, . . ., transposition of the
two neighbored factors ̸ar and ̸ar+1 yields
tr(̸a1 · · · ̸ar ̸ar+1 · · · ̸aN) = −tr(̸a1 · · · ̸ar+1 ̸ar · · · ̸aN) +
+2(arar+1) · tr(̸a1 · · · ̸ar−1 ̸ar+2 · · · ̸aN).
(T8) Chirality: tr(̸a · γ5) = tr(̸a ̸b · γ5) = 0, and
i
4 tr(̸a ̸b ̸c ̸d · γ5) = a ∧b ∧c ∧d = ϵμνκλaμbνcκdλ.
Proof. Ad (T1). ̸a = aμγμ = aμγμ.
Ad (T2). By the Cliﬀord relation,
̸a ̸b+ ̸b ̸a = aμbν[γμ, γν]+ = 2aμbνημν = 2ab.
Hence ̸a ̸b = 2ab−̸b ̸a.
Ad (T3), (T4). Apply Prop. 15.2.
Ad(T5). By the Cliﬀord relation,
tr(̸a ̸b) = aμbν tr(γμγν) = 4aμbνημν = 4aμbμ = 4ab.
The proof of the general recursive formula can be found in Problem 1.12.
Ad (T6). Note that ̸a2

Ad (T7). Use (T2).

The key reduction formula (T5) above allows us to reduce the computation of
traces to the computation of inner products. This can be done by using computer
algebra, since (T5) represents a universal algorithm. For doing computations by
hand, the special reduction formula (T7) above is usefully combined with the square
trick. For example,
tr(̸a ̸b ̸c ̸d) = 2(ab) · tr(̸c ̸d) −tr(̸b ̸a ̸c ̸d).
If a = c and c2 = 0, then the last term vanishes, by the square trick. Thus,

tr(̸a ̸b ̸c ̸d) = 8(ab)(cd).
This argument will be frequently used in the proof of Prop. 15.4 below.

Let us suppose that

Then
aAb = tr(Aba).

T := tr

M(̸q + me)M(̸q′ + me)

and q′ = q + p −p′. To simplify notation, set
m := me,
ω := ωp,r,
ω′ := ωp′,r′,
and e := er, e′ := er′ for r, r′ = 1, 2.14 Moreover, choose
P :≠p,
Q :≠q,
E ≠e,
E′ ≠e′.
In terms of this notation, it is our goal to compute the trace
T = tr
`
M(Q + m)M(Q′ + m)
´
with Q′ = Q + P −P ′, and
M = E′ Q + P + m
(q + p)2 −m2 E + E Q −P ′ + m
(q −p′)2 −m2 E′.
The trace T can be computed systematically by using the general reduction formula
from Prop. 15.3 on page 905. This is the brute force method.
We are going to simplify critically this approach by using symmetry prop-
erties.
(II) Inner products. We want to compute the inner products between the given
4-vectors p, q, p′, q′, e, and e′:
(i) p2 = p′2 = 0.
(ii) q2 = q′2 = m2.
(iii) pq = mω and p′q = mω′.
(iv) pp′ = m(ω −ω′).
(v) (p + q)2 −m2 = 2mω and (q −p′)2 −m2 = −2mω′.
(vi) e2 = e′2 = −1 and ee′ = −ee′.
(vii) eq = ep = e′q = 0 and e′p′ = 0.
(viii) e′q′ = e′p and q′p = qp′ = mω′.
Let us prove this.
Ad (i). By photon energy, p2 = (ω, p)(ω, p) = ω2 −p2 = 0.
Ad (ii). By electron energy, q2 = (m, 0)(m, 0) = m2.
Ad (iii). pq = (ω, p)(m, 0) = mω.
Ad (iv). It follows from
0 = q′2 −m2 = (q + p −p′)2 −m2 = q2 + 2qp −2qp′ −2pp′ −m2
that pp′ = qp −qp′ = m(ω −ω′).
Ad (v). (p + q)2 −m2 = p2 + 2pq + q2 −m2 = 2pq = 2mω.
Ad (vi). e2 = (0, e)(0, e) = −e2 = −1, and
ee′ = (0, e)(0, e′) = −ee′.
Ad (vii). We have eq = (0, e)(m, 0) = 0. Hence, by transversality,
ep = (0, e)(ω, p) = −ep = 0.
14 Only in this proof, the symbol e represents a polarization 4-vector, but not the
electron charge.

15.1 Compton Eﬀect
909
Ad (viii). We have e′q′ = e′(q + p −p′) = e′q. Using momentum conservation,
we get p + q = p′ + q′. Hence
(p −q′)2 = (q −p′)2.
Thus, p2 + q′2 −2pq′ = q2 −2qp′ + p′2.

(III) Anticommutation relations. We claim that the following relations hold:
(a) [E, Q]+ = [E′, Q]+ = [E, P]+ = [E′, P ′]+ = 0.
(b) (Q + m)E(Q + m) = (Q + m)E′(Q + m) = 0.
(c) (Q + m)EPE′(Q + m) = 2(pq)E(Q −m)E′.
Let us prove this.
Ad (a). [E, Q]+ = 2eq = 0.
Ad (b). By (a), EQ = −QE. Hence (Q + m)E(Q + m) ist equal to
−E(Q −m)(Q + m) = Q2 −m2 = 1
2[Q, Q]+ −m2 = q2 −m2 = 0.
Ad (c). The matrix (Q + m)EPE′(Q + m) is equal to
A := −E(Q −m)PE′(Q + m).
Using QP = 2qp −PQ, we get
A = −E
`
2qp −P(Q + m)
´
E′(Q + m)
= −2(qp)EE′(Q + m) = 2(qp)E(Q −m)E′.

(IV) Matrix M. By (II),
M = E′ Q + P + m
2mω
E + E Q −P ′ + m

E′.
Setting A, B = E, E′, Q, Q′, P, P ′ and using AB = B · A = B · A, we obtain
M = E Q + P + m
2mω
E′ + E′ Q −P ′ + m
2mω′
E.
(V) Matrix N. Deﬁne
N := E′PE
2mω + EP ′E′
2mω′ .
Then
N = EPE′
2mω + E′P ′E
2mω′ .
By (III)(b), we get
T = tr
`
N(Q + m)N(Q′ + m)
´
with Q′ = Q + P −P ′. This tells us that the matrix M can be replaced by the
simpler matrix N.

along with
T11 := tr E′PE(Q + m)EPE′(Q′ + m),
T22 := tr EP ′E′(Q + m)E′P ′E(Q′ + m),
T12 := tr E′PE(Q + m)E′P ′E(Q′ + m),
T21 := tr EP ′E′(Q + m)EPE′(Q′ + m).
Here, we set Q′ := Q + P −P ′.
(VII) Computation of T11. We use the following decomposition:
T11 = T110 + mT111 + m2T112.
Here, we set
T110 := tr(E′PEQEPE′Q′),
T112 := tr(E′PEEPE′).
Now we use the trace rules (T1ﬀ) from Prop. 15.3 on page 905. Since T111 contains
an odd number of factors, T111 = 0.
By the square trick (T6) along with p2 = 0,
T112 = e2 tr(E′P 2E′) = e2p2 tr(E′2) = 0.
By the special reduction formula (T7) on page 905 along with qe = 0, we get
T110 = −tr(E′PQE2PE′Q′).
By the square trick along with e2 = −1,
T110 = tr(E′PQPE′Q′).
By the special reduction formula,
T110 = 2pq tr(E′PE′Q′) −tr(E′PQP 2E′Q′).
Since p2 = 0, the last term vanishes. By Prop. 15.3(T5) on page 905,
T110 = 8pq
`
2(e′p)(e′q′) −e′2(pq′)
´
.
By (II)(viii),
T11 = T110 = 16mω(pe′)2 + 8m2ωω′.
(VIII) Crossing symmetry. The transformation
p ⇔−p′,
e ⇔e′
induces P ⇔−P ′, E ⇔E′. Thus, T11 is transformed into T22. Hence
T22 = −16mω′(p′e)2 + 8m2ωω′.
(IX) Reversion symmetry. We want to show that
T12 = T21.
Indeed, by Prop. 15.3(T3), the trace of a product of Feynman slash matrices does
not change if we reverse the order of the factors. Hence

15.1 Compton Eﬀect
911
T21 = tr(Q′ + m)E′PE(Q + m)E′P ′E.
By cyclic permutation,
T21 = tr
`
E′PE(Q + m)E′P ′E(Q′ + m)
´
= T12.
(X) Computation of T12. Using Q′ = Q + P −P ′, we obtain
T12 = tr EP ′E′(Q + m)EPE′(Q + m)
+ tr EP ′E′(Q + m)EPE′P −tr EP ′E′(Q + m)EPE′P ′.
In the last two summands, the mass term drops out because of an odd number of
factors. Therefore, we get the decomposition
T12 = T120 + T121 + T122.
Here, we set
T120 :=
tr EP ′E′(Q + m)EPE′(Q + m),
T121 :=
tr EP ′E′QEPE′P,
T122 := −tr EP ′E′QEPE′P ′.
(XI) Computation of T120. By (III)(c),
(Q + m)EPE′(Q + m) = 2mωE(Q −m)E′.
Hence
T120 = 2mω tr EP ′E′E(Q −m)E′.
The mass terms drops out because of an odd number of factors. Using the relation
EP ′ = −P ′E, and so on, we get
T120 = 2mω tr(EE′P ′QEE′).
Hence
T120 = 2mω tr
`
(2ee′ −E′E)P ′QEE′´
.
By the square trick (T6), we obtain
tr E′EP ′QEE′ = tr P ′QE′E2E′ = e2e′2 tr P ′Q = 4p′q = 4mω′.
Since qe′ = qe = 0, we get
tr(P ′QEE′) = 4(p′q)(ee′) = −4mω′(ee′).
This implies
T120 = 8m2ωω′`
2(ee′)2 −1
´
.
(XII) Computation of T121. Using the special reduction formula (T7) on page
905, we obtain
T121 = 2(e′p) tr(EP ′E′QEP) −tr(EP ′E′QEP 2E′).
Since p2 = 0, the last term drops out. Using EP = −PE along with cyclic permu-
tation,
T121 = −2(e′p) tr(EP ′E′QPE)
= −2(e′p) tr(P ′E′QPE2) = 2(e′p) tr(P ′E′QP).

912
15. Applications to Physical Eﬀects
Since e′p′ = e′q = 0,
T121 = −8(e′p)2(p′q) = −8mω′(e′p)2.
Similarly, we obtain
T122 = −8mω(p′e)2.
This implies the ﬁnal relation
T12 = T21 = 8m2ωω′`
2(ee′)2 −1

−8mω′(pe′)2 + 8mω(p′e)2.

This ﬁnishes our computation of the cross section for the Compton eﬀect in
second order. Despite the use of symmetry, the argument has been lengthy.
It is typical for elementary particle physics that the computations of phys-
ical eﬀects are rather involved.
Nowadays sophisticated computer programs are used by physicists (see Sect. 18.4
on page 977).
15.1.3 Relativistic Invariance
Physical processes proceed the same way in each inertial system.
Einstein’s 1905 principle of special relativity
Our computation for the cross section of the Compton eﬀect has been carried out
in the resting system of the electron. We now want to compute the cross section in
an arbitrary inertial system. Analyzing the preceding proof, it turns out that it can
be carried out in an relativistically invariant manner by only using inner products
between 4-vectors. The trace formula (15.6) can be written as
T = 2
„p′q
pq + pq
p′q −2 + 4(erer′)2
«
.
This is a relativistically invariant formula which coincides with our result in the rest
frame. This formula is valid in each inertial system. Here, e and m is the charge and
the rest mass of the electron. Moreover, re = α/m is the classical electron radius.15
The Mandelstam variables. We set
s := (p + q)2,
t = (p′ −p)2,
u := (p′ −q)2.
Conservation of 4-momentum tells us that p + q = p′ + q′. Hence
s = (p′ + q′)2 = m2 + 2pq = m2 + 2p′q′,
t = (q′ −q)2 = 2m2 −2pp′ = −2q′q,
u = (q′ −p)2 = m2 −2qp′ = m2 −2q′p.
15 To simplify notation, we denote the electron mass me by m.

15.1 Compton Eﬀect
913
The variables s, t, u are called Mandelstam variables. We have
u = 2m2 −s −t.
Thus, the variable u depends on s and t. However, in order to get symmetric
formulas, it is convenient to use the three variables u, s, t. The crossing symmetry
transformation p ⇔−p′ corresponds to
s ⇔u,
t ⇔t.
(15.7)
The relativistically invariant cross section. In second order, the diﬀerential
cross section for the Compton eﬀect is given by

This formula is invariant under the crossing symmetry transformation (15.7). The
corresponding total cross section reads as
σ =

S2
dσ
dΩ · dΩ.
This relativistically invariant formula is valid in each inertial system. In the rest
frame of the electron, we get
s = m2 + 2mω,
u = m2 −2mω′,
t = 2ωω′(cos ϑ −1).
This yields the famous Klein–Nishina formula:16

.
Here, the incoming (resp. outgoing) photon has the frequency ω (resp. ω′). More-
over, ϑ is the angle between the incoming and the outgoing photon. Explicitly,
introducing the dimensionless parameter η := ω/m, we get
ω′ =
ω
1 + η cos ϑ.
Recall that the Klein–Nishina formula above averages over both the spin of the
electrons and the polarization of the photons. Physicists speak of the cross section
for the scattering of an electron with unpolarized light.
The classical Thomson scattering as an approximation. For visible light,
we have η ∼10−5. In this case, the frequency relation ω′ = ω is a good approxima-
tion, and we get the following diﬀerential cross section formula:
16 This formula was obtained in 1929, long before the foundation of quantum elec-
trodynamics in the late 1940s.

SI system.
15.2 Asymptotically Free Electrons in an External
Electromagnetic Field
15.2.1 The Key Formula for the Cross Section
In this section, we work again in the energetic system. Consider a right-handed
Cartesian (x, y, z)-coordinate system with right-handed orthonormal basis vectors
i, j, k. Suppose a particle P0 of electric charge Q0 rests at the origin. This particle
generates the electrostatic potential U = U(x) with the Fourier representation
U(x) =
1
(2π)3
Z
R3 U(p)eipxd3p.
We want to study the situation where a homogenous stream of incoming particles
is scattered at the particle P0 with the charge Q0. (Fig. 15.2). We assume that the
incoming particles have the rest mass m, the electric charge Q, the velocity vector
v := vi with v > 0, the momentum vector p = pi with p = mv/
√
1 −v2. Moreover,
suppose that the incoming particle stream possesses the current density vector
Jin = ϱv
with the particle density
ϱin := Nin
V .
That is, the number of incoming particles is equal to Nin in a box of volume V. The
momentum vector of the outgoing particles has the form
p′ = p′ cos ϑ · (cos ϕ i + sin ϕ j) + p′ sin ϑ k,
with respect to spherical coordinates π ∈] −π, π] and ϑ ∈[−π
2 , π
2 ]. Let Ω0 be a
subset of the unit sphere. We will motivate below that the cross section with respect
to the solid angle Ω0 is given by the formula
σ(Ω0) =

(15.8)
Let Nout denote the number of scattered particles during the time interval [t0, t1]
such that the unit vector p′/|p′| lives in the set Ω0. Then
Nout = σ(Ω0)Jin(t1 −t0).

Here, r0 = 1/κ is the typical range of the Yukawa potential. For the Fourier trans-
form of the Yukawa potential, we get

15.2.3 Application to Coulomb Scattering
The Coulomb potential corresponds to the parameter κ = 0. In the non-relativistic
case, the momentum vector is given by p = mv (resp. p′ = mv′) and p ≪m (resp.
p′ ≪m).17 Moreover, conservation of kinetic energy tells us that 1
2m0v2 = 1
2m0v′2.
Hence p2 = p′2, and
(p −p′)2 = p2 + p′2 −2pp′ = 2p2(1 −cos ϑ) = 4p2 sin2 ϑ
2 .
This implies the following classical Rutherford formula for Coulomb scattering:

15.2.4 Motivation of the Key Formula via S-Matrix
The transition amplitude. The idea is to use the transition amplitude from
(14.1) by replacing the photon ﬁeld by the 4-potential A0, A1, A2, A3 of an external
electromagnetic ﬁeld. The incoming particle is described by the normalized state
Φin := b+
p,s|0⟩,
and the outgoing particle corresponds to the normalized state
Φout := b+
p′,s′|0⟩.
The transition probability from the state Φin to the state Φout during the time
interval [−T
2 , T
2 ] is given by
W(T) := |⟨p′|SN(T)|p⟩|2
(15.9)
along with the transition amplitude
⟨p′|SN(T)|p⟩:= ⟨Φout|SN(T)Φin⟩= ⟨0|b−

(15.11)
Here, Aμ = Aμ(x), μ = 0, 1, 2, 3, denotes the 4-potential of the external electromag-
netic ﬁeld, and ψ = ψ(x) denotes the free electron-positron ﬁeld with x = (x, t).
This setting is obtained by completely replacing the photon quantum ﬁeld
by the external electromagnetic ﬁeld.
Note that this is only an approximation of reality. This approach completely ignores
the possible quantum eﬀects caused by photons (see Sect. 15.2.5).
Concerning (15.11), the electron has the electric charge Q = −e. However, this
expression is also valid for incoming particles with arbitrary electric charge Q. For
example, the case Q = e corresponds to incoming protons. Let us discuss some
approximations.

The cross section. Let us compute the cross section in ﬁrst-order approxi-
mation. This is related to ϱ1 computed in (15.12).We will proceed similarly to the
Compton eﬀect above. The cross section σ is given by
Nout = σJinT
with Jin = ϱv = v/V. Here, Nout is the number of outgoing particles during the
time interval [−T

Here, we count the number of outgoing particles by using the cell quantization of
the phase space, as explained in (14.15) on page 893. Furthermore, we average over
the spin states of the incoming particles, and we sum over the spin states of the
outgoing particles. For the total cross section, we get

sponds to an electric ﬁeld with the potential U. By energy conservation, Ep = Ep′.
Then

15.2.5 Perspectives
External electromagnetic ﬁelds and Hilbert–Schmidt operators. An ex-
tensive rigorous functional analytic investigation of electrons and positrons in an
external electromagnetic ﬁeld can be found in
G. Scharf, Finite Quantum Electrodynamics: the Causal Approach, Sprin-
ger, Berlin, 1995, Sect. 2.4.
Here, the theory makes essentially use of compact Hilbert–Schmidt operators in
Hilbert spaces. We also refer to:
R. Seiler, Quantum theory of particles with spin zero and one half in
external ﬁelds, Commun. Math. Phys. 25 (1972), 127–151.
The reader should observe that this nice functional-analytic approach fails for gen-
eral photon ﬁelds in quantum electrodynamics.
Radiative corrections. The S-matrix introduced in (15.10) on page 916 only
incompletely describes the electron in an external electromagnetic ﬁeld. In the lan-
guage of physicists, the full description in terms of quantum electrodynamics has
to take into account the interaction of the electron with virtual photons, virtual
electrons, and virtual positrons (vacuum ﬂuctuations). This means that, besides
the Feynman graphs depicted in Figs. 15.3 and 15.4 on page 917, there appear
additional crucial Feyman graphs as depicted in Fig. 17.8 on page 960. This leads
to so-called radiative corrections based on renormalization theory. Such processes
are responsible for the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (see Chap. 17).
Here, theory and experiment coincide with extremely high accuracy. In the next
section, we will use ﬁrst-order perturbation theory in order to compute a physi-
cal eﬀect which is well known from quantum mechanics. In this connection, the
methods of renormalization theory are not necessary.

Field
We shall consider the transitions produced in an atomic system by an ar-
bitrary perturbation. The method we shall adopt will be that previously
given by the author, which leads in a simple way to equations which de-
termine the probability of the system being in any stationary state of the
unperturbed system at any time. This, of course, gives immediately the
probable number of systems in that state at that time for an assembly of
the systems that are independent of one another and are all perturbed in
the same way.

Bound states of an electron in an atom. In an arbitrary, but ﬁxed inertial

for an electron of electric charge −e and mass me which is bound in an atom under
the inﬂuence of the time-independent electrostatic potential
U = U(x).
The function U describes the electric forces caused by the atomic nucleus and the
remaining electrons. This corresponds to the 4-potential A0 := U and Aj := 0 for
j = 1, 2, 3. Suppose that there exist solutions

15.3.1 The Spontaneous Emission of Photons by the Atom
The physical experiment shows that atoms radiate photons. This is caused by ran-
dom jumps of the electrons of the atom. Such jumps represent typical quantum
processes. Explicitly, if the electron jumps from the energy level En to the lower
energy level En′, then one photon is emitted which has the energy
ω′ = En −En′.
Suppose that there are N atoms in a cubic box C(L) of volume V. Let Nout (resp.
Eout) be the number of spontaneously emitted photons (resp. the emitted energy)
during the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. Then

R3 d3x ϕn′(x)†xϕn(x).
Motivation. We want to motivate (15.18). The wave functions ϕn and ϕ′
n of
a bound electron in an atom are concentrated approximately in a ball about the
origin of Bohr radius r0 = 10−8 cm. The basic idea of our approximation is the
fact that the wave length λ ∼10−4 cm of visible light is much larger than the Bohr
radius r0. Since |p′| = 2π/λ is small compared with r0, the integral
⟨ϕn′|αer · e−ip′xϕn⟩=
Z
R3 d3x ϕn′(x)†αer · e−ip′xϕn(x)
can be approximately computed by setting e−ip′x ≃1. Hence
⟨ϕn′|αer · e−ip′xϕn⟩≃⟨ϕn′|αer · ϕn⟩.
To compute this, we introduce the momentum operator P = −i∂and the Hamil-
tonian
H := γ0me + αP −eU.
Then, the Dirac equation for the electron can be written as
i ˙ψ = Hψ.
In particular, Hϕn = Enϕn and Hϕn′ = En′ϕn′. By Heisenberg’s commutation
relation, [xj, −i∂k]−= iδjk. Hence
[x, H]−= [x, αP]−= iα.
Consequently, the inner product i⟨ϕn′|erα · ϕn⟩is equal to
⟨ϕn′|er[x, H]−ϕn⟩= ⟨ϕn′|erx · Hϕn −erH(xϕn)⟩
= ⟨ϕn′|erx · Hϕn⟩−⟨Hϕn′|erx · ϕn⟩= (En −En′)⟨ϕn′|erx · ϕn⟩.
Therefore,
|⟨ϕn′|erα · ϕn⟩|2 = ω′2 |⟨ϕn′|erx · ϕn⟩|2.

Now we want to average over the polarization vector e1. To this end, ﬁx the mo-

to p′. Using spherical coordinates, we have
e1 = cos ϑ(cos ϕ i + sin ϕ j) + sin ϑ k.
Deﬁne the special transition amplitudes
ax := ⟨ϕn′|xϕn⟩,
ay := ⟨ϕn′|yϕn⟩,

|⟨ϕn′|xϕn⟩|2 = |ax|2 + |ay|2 + |az|2.
Moreover,
e1x = x cos ϑ cos ϕ + y cos ϑ sin ϕ + z sin ϑ.
Thus, |(ϕn′|⟨e1x)ϕn⟩|2 is equal to
|ax|2 cos2 ϑ cos2 ϕ + |ay|2 cos2 ϑ sin2 ϕ + |az|2 sin2 ϑ
+bxy cos2 ϑ cos ϕ sin ϕ + bxz cos ϑ sin ϑ cos ϕ + byz cos ϑ sin ϑ sin ϕ.

15.4 Cherenkov Radiation
In 1934, Pavel Cherenkov discovered a new kind of radiation called Cherenkov
radiation.20 This is a radiation in the form of bluish light, produced by charged
particles moving in a transparent medium.
Einstein’s principle of special relativity postulates that, in a vacuum, the
speed of massive particles is less than the speed of light.
20 For the discovery and the interpretation of the Cherenkov eﬀect, Cherenkov,
Frank, and Tamm were awarded the Noble prize in physics in 1958.

Fig. 15.5. Cherenkov eﬀect
The point is that the situation may change if we replace the vacuum by special
media. In fact, there exist media where cm < c, i.e., the speed of light, cm, in the
medium is less than the speed of light, c, in a vacuum. In this case, it is possible
that massive particles (e.g., electrons) move with a velocity v which satisﬁes the
key inequality
cm < v < c.
(15.19)
The condition v < c is forced by Einstein’s principle of special relativity. The point
is that the particle speed v is greater than the speed of light cm in the medium. If the
inequality (15.19) is satisﬁed, then the Cherenkov eﬀect appears. The Cherenkov
radiation is emitted in a cone around the direction in which the particle is travelling
(Fig. 15.5(a)).
Let us work in the energetic system of units, i.e., we set c = ℏ= ε0 := 1. We
will use the following notation:
(i) Medium
• velocity of light in the medium: 0 < cm < 1;
• refraction index of the medium: n := 1/cm > 1.
(ii) Incoming electron
• rest mass me;
• velocity vector: v = −vi with cm < v < 1;
• momentum vector: q = mev/
√
1 −v2; moreover, v = |q|/Eq;
• energy: Eq =
p
m2e + q2;
• 4-momentum vector: q = (q, Eq).
(iii) Emitted photon
• momentum vector p′;
• energy (frequency): ωp′ = cm|p′|;
• 4-momentum: p′ = (p′, ωp′);
• the angle between the incoming electron and the emitted photon is denoted
by ϑ.
(iv) Outgoing electron after the emission of the photon
• momentum vector: q′ = q −p′;
• energy: Eq′ =
p
m2e + q′2 = Eq −ωp′;
• 4-momentum vector: q′ = (q′, Eq′).
The emission angle ϑ of the photon is restricted by the following inequality:
0 ≤ϑ < ϑmax.
Here, the maximal angle is determined by the equation

928
15. Applications to Physical Eﬀects
cos ϑmax = cm
v ,
0 < ϑmax < π
2 .
If there are N incoming electrons, then the total energy of the emitted photons
during the suﬃciently large time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ] is equal to
Eemission = τNT.
The emission rate is given by
τ = α ·

where α = e2/4π = 1/137.04 denotes the ﬁne structure constant. This formula for
τ shows the angle distribution of the emitted photon energy, too. Computation of
the integral yields

(15.20)
Motivation for the emission angle. By energy-momentum conservation,
q′ + p′ = q.
Thus, q′ + p′ = q and Eq′ + ωp′ = Eq. It follows from E2
q′ = (Eq −ωp′)2 that
m2
e + (p′ −q)2 = E2
q −2ωp′Eq + ω2
p′.
This implies p′2 −2p′q = −2cm|p′|Eq + c2
mp′2. Consequently,
|p′|(|p′| −2|q| cos ϑ + 2cmEq −c2
m|p′|) = 0.
Assuming that the momentum vector p′ of the photon is nontrivial, we get
|p′|(1 −c2
m) −2|q| cos ϑ + 2cmEq = 0.
This yields the key relation
|p′| = 2(|q| cos ϑ −cmEq)
1 −c2m
.
(15.21)
Since |p′| > 0, the angle ϑ satisﬁes the following condition
cos ϑ > cmEq
|q|
= cm
v .
This shows that 0 ≤ϑ < ϑmax along with cos ϑmax = cm/v.
Motivation for the emission rate. We will use similar arguments as in the
preceding examples. Set x := (x, t). The Cherenkov eﬀect corresponds to a passage

From qe1′ = 0 and qe2′ = −nω sin ϑ we obtain

and f(ω, ϑ) := Ep′−q(ω, ϑ)+ω −Eq. The momentum vector q of the incoming
electron is ﬁxed. Let us also ﬁx the direction of the momentum vector p′, i.e.,
let us ﬁx the angle ϑ. We want to integrate over the photon energy, ω. By
(15.21), the equation
f(ω, ϑ) = 0
has the solution ω = ωp′ along with
ωp′ = 2(n|q|ζ −Eq)

(15.23)
This corresponds to Ep′−q(ωp′, ϑ) = Eq −ωp′ which describes conservation of

over all possible photon energies, ω. The integrand is concentrated at the en-
ergy, ωp′, which corresponds to energy conservation for the Cherenkov process.
A standard property of the Dirac delta function (see (14.19)) tells us that
J(ϑ) =
F(ωp′, ϑ)
|fω(ωp′, ϑ)|.
For the partial derivative, we get
fω(ω, ϑ) = 1 + n2ω −n|q|ζ
Ep′−q(ω, ϑ) .
By (15.23), we obtain
fω(ωp′, ϑ) = Eq −ωp′ + n2ωp′ −n|q|ζ

Solution: Choose smooth test functions hμ : Ω →C which have compact

By the complex variational lemma (see Sect. 10.4.1 of Vol. I), we obtain
γ0(iγα∇α −me)ψ = 0,
−i∂αψγα + eAαψγα −meψ = 0.
Since the inverse matrix to γ0 exists, we get the Dirac equation (15.24) and its
adjoint equation (15.25). Finally, let us show that (15.25) is a consequence of
(15.24). In fact, equation (15.24) reads as
γα(i∂αψ + eAα)ψ = meψ.
Applying the operator † to (15.24), we get
(−i∂αψ† + eAαψ†)γα† = meψ†.
Multiplying this by γ0 from the right and using
γ0† = γ0,
γj† = −γj,
γjγ0 = −γjγ0,

we obtain
(−i∂αψ†γ0 + eAαψ†γ0)γα = meψ†γ0.
This is the desired relation (15.25).

Remark: It turns out that the second approach to quantum electrodynamics is
more convenient than the ﬁrst approach discussed in Problem 15.3. The reason
is that the wave equation appears for the four-potential in the second approach.

15.11 Relativistically invariant projection operators for electron-positron waves. We
want to construct plane wave solutions of the Dirac equation
i̸∂ψ = meψ
which are relativistically invariant. Here, we use Feynman’s slash symbol23
̸∂:= γα∂α,
̸p := pαγα,
̸Π := Παγα.
The idea is to introduce ﬁrst projection operators Pα(p, Π), α = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Then, the eigenvectors of these operators to the eigenvalue λ = 1 generate the
plane wave solutions

p,Π(x) = u(p, Π)e−ipx,

of the Dirac equation where px := Ept −px. These solutions depend on the
momentum 4-vector p, the polarization 4-vector Π, and the sign ± of energy.
To ﬁx notation, let p = (p0, p1, p2, p3) and Π = (Π0, Π1, Π2, Π3) be 4-vectors
with
p2 = m2
e,
Π2 = −1,
pΠ = 0.
The general form of p, Π can be parameterized by the arbitrary momentum
vector p = p1i + p2j + p3k. Explicitly, for p ̸= 0 let
p := (Ep, p),
Ep :=

m2e + p2,
Π :=

p −p2 = m2

Π2 = ΠαΠβηαβ = (Π0)2 −Π 2 = p2

Finally, we obtain
pΠ = pαΠβηαβ = p0Π0 −pΠ = Ep|p|

For p = 0, let
p := (me, 0),
Π := (0, Π)
where Π is an arbitrary unit vector. This corresponds to a resting particle
having the spin vector Π. Now to the point. Deﬁne the two key operators

Σ(Π) := I + γ5̸ Π

Using this, let us introduce the following four operators:
P0(p, Π) : = Λ+(p)Σ(Π),
P1(p, Π) := Λ+(p)Σ(−Π),
P2(p, Π) : = Λ−(p)Σ(Π),
P3(p, Π) := Λ−(p)Σ(−Π).
Show that the following hold:
(i) Commutation rules: [Λ±(p), Σ(Π)]−= 0.
23 Recall that γα∂α = P3
α=0 γα∂α by the Einstein convention.

(ii) Projection operators: The operators Λ±(p), Σ(Π), Pα(p, Π) are projection
operators. That is, for α = 0, 1, 2, 3, we have
Λ±(p)2 = Λ±(p),
Σ(Π)2 = Σ(Π),
Pα(p, Π)2 = Pα(p, Π).
Moreover, Λ−(p) = I −Λ+(p), and
3
X
α=0
Pα(p, Π) = I,
as well as Pα(p, Π)Pβ(p, Π) = 0 if α ̸= β, and α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3.
(iii) For each α = 0, 1, 2, 3, the image space of the operator
Pα(p, Π) : C4 →C4
is one-dimensional. Thus, there exists an eigenvector wα(p, Π) of the form
Pαwα(p, Π) = wα(p, Π),
α = 0, 1, 2, 3.
This eigenvector is uniquely determined up to a nonzero complex factor.
(iv) Plane wave solutions: Set
u(p, Π) := w0(p, Π),
u(p, −Π) := w1(p, Π),
v(p, Π) := w2(p, −Π),
v(p, −Π) := w3(p, Π).
Then, the four functions ψ+
p,Π, ψ+
p,−Π, ψ−
p,Π, ψ−
p,−Π introduced in (15.30)
are solutions of the Dirac equation i̸∂ψ = meψ. Furthermore,
Hψ±
p,Π = ±Epψ±
p,Π,
Σ(Π)ψ±
p,Π = ψ±
p,Π.
In terms of the amplitudes u and v, we get
(i̸ p −me)ψ±
p,Π = 0,
(i̸ p + me)ψ±
p,Π = 0,
Λ±(p)u(p, Π) = u(p, Π),
Λ±(p)v(p, Π) = v(p, Π),
Σ(Π)u(p, Π) = u(p, Π),
Σ(Π)v(p, Π) = v(p, Π).
Naturally enough, all of these relations remain true if we replace the po-
larization 4-vector Π by −Π.
Explicitly, for given nonzero momentum vector p, choose p and Π as in
(15.31). Using the helicity solutions, ϕ±, from Problem 15.10, we obtain

p,Π = ϕ±

15.12 Proof of Example 15.2. Solution:
Ad (a)–(d). This follows from the deﬁnition of the Dirac matrices.
Ad (e), (f), (n). Obviously, tr γμ = 0. Now the trick is to use the matrix γ5. By
property (d),
γ5γμγνγκγ5 = −γ5γ5(γμγνγκ) = −γμγνγκ.
Since (γ5)−1 = γ5,
tr(γμγνγκ) = tr(γ5γμγνγκγ5) = −tr(γμγνγκ).
Taking (g)–(l) for granted, the trace tr(γμ1 · · · γμN ) is real, by (h). Thus, it
follows from (b) and (l) that

tr(γμ1 · · · γμN ) = tr(γμN · · · γμ1) = tr(γμN · · · γμ1).
Ad (g). By the Cliﬀord relation (c),
2 tr(γμγν) = 2ημν tr I = 8ημν.
Ad (h), (n), (o). To simplify notation, we set A := aμγμ, B := bνγν,. . . By (g),
tr(AB) = aμbν tr(γμγν) = 4aμbνημν = 4aμbμ.
By the Cliﬀord relation (c),
tr(ABCD) + tr(BACD) = tr(AB + BA) tr(CD).
By permutation,
tr(ABCD) =
2 tr(AB) tr(CD) −tr(BACD),
−tr(BACD) = −2 tr(AC) tr(BD) + tr(BCAD),
tr(BCAD) =
2 tr(AD) tr(BC) −tr(BCDA).
Adding this, we obtain24
tr(ABCD) = tr(AB) tr(CD) −tr(AC) tr(BD) + tr(AD) tr(BC).
This is the claim for N = 4. The general case can be treated similarly.
Ad (i). By the Cliﬀord relation (c),
tr(γμγνγ5) + tr(γνγμγ5) = 2ημν tr(γ5) = 0.
Thus, tr(γμγνγ5) is antisymmetric with respect to the indices μ, ν. Finally, for
(μ, ν) = (0, 1), (0, 2), . . ., an explicit computation yields tr(γμγνγ5) = 0.
Ad (j). An explicit computation yields the following key relation
γμγνγκ = ημνγκ −ημκγν + γνκγμ −iϵμνκσγσγ5.
Using (γ5)2 = I and statement (i), we get
tr(γμγνγκγλγ5) = −iϵμνκσ tr(γσγλ) = −4iϵμνκσηλ
σ = −4iϵμνκλ.

15.13 Proof of Furry’s rule. Solution: Let us start with a 2-vertex electron loop (see
Table 14.3(a), (b) on page 888). By the Wick theorem, we have to consider the
pairing25
ψ(x)ψ(x)ψ(y)ψ(y).
24 Note that tr(BCDA) = tr(ABCD) by cyclic permutation.
25 To simplify notation, the pairings for the photon are not indicated.

Fig. 15.6. Furry’s rule
After an even permutation of the factors, we get
ψ(x)ψ(y)ψ(x)ψ(y).
Since ψ(x)ψ(y) = −ψ(y)ψ(x), we obtain
−ψ(x)ψ(y)ψ(y)ψ(x).
Graphically, this represents two electron lines from y to x and from x to y,
along with a minus sign.
This way, positron lines can be reduced to electron lines (plus an ad-
ditional minus sign).
This is the simplest form of Furry’s rule.
Now consider the case of a 3-vertex electron loop. The idea is that the con-
tributions coming from the two graphs from Fig. 15.6 compensate each other
after carrying out the substitution γμ →−γμ for the Dirac matrices. In fact,
the graphs (a) and (b) of Fig. 15.6 yield the transition amplitude L + R. Sym-
bolically,
L = tr
`
A(x)S(x, y)A(y)S(y, z)A(z)S(z, x)
´
and
R = tr
`
A(x)S(x, z)A(z)S(z, y)A(y)S(y, x)
´
.
Now consider the term R and use the following identities:
(i) tr(γμγνγλ) = tr(γλγνγμ);
(ii) tr(γμγνγλ) = tr
`
(−γμ)(−γν)(−γλ)
´
;
(iii) A(x; −γ) = −A(x; γ) and S(x, y; −γ) = S(x, y; γ).
Replacing the Dirac matrix γμ by −γμ and applying cyclic permutations, we
get
R = (−1)3 tr
`
A(x)S(z, x)A(z)S(y, z)A(y)S(x, y)
´
= −tr
`
S(x, y)A(y)S(y, z)A(z)S(z, x)A(x)
´
= −tr
`
A(x)S(x, y)A(y)S(y, z)A(z)S(z, x)
´
.
Hence L + R = 0. In the general case, we argue similarly.

16. The Continuum Limit
Scattering processes for elementary particles are based on the long-time
limit, the high-energy limit, and the low-energy limit. Try to compute these
limits only for quantities which are measurable in physical experiments
(e.g., cross sections).
The golden rule of quantum ﬁeld theory
In Sect. 14.7 we applied this golden rule to the cross section of the Compton scatter-
ing between photons and electrons. This way, we obtained the famous Klein–Nishina
formula in lowest order of perturbation theory. This formula can be established by
physical experiments. In this connection, we argued as follows: We started with a
lattice. Then we studied the three fundamental limits: Pmax →+∞(high-energy
limit), V →+∞, Δp →0 (low-energy limit), and T →+∞(long-time limit), by
using the language of distributions. In addition, we included the two limits ε →+0
(electron propagator regularization) and mph →+0 (photon propagator regular-
ization – the virtual photon mass goes to zero). In this chapter, we want to discuss
how this approach can be applied to general problems in quantum electrodynamics.
16.1 The Fundamental Limits
Choice of the lattice. Recall that we put the physical system in a cubic box
of side length L and ﬁnite volume V = L3. Furthermore, we observe the physical
system during the ﬁnite time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ]. In addition, as in Sect. 12.1.1 on page
799, we consider a ﬁnite lattice G(N) in momentum space with minimal momentum
Δp := 2π/L and maximal momentum
Pmax := N · Δp.
Feynman rules. Suppose that we have computed the transition probability
W(T) for a speciﬁc process in ﬁxed order of perturbation theory by using the
Feynman rules for a lattice in momentum space, as formulated in Table 14.5 on
page 897. The analytic expressions are well deﬁned, but the transition probability
depends on
• the choice of the ﬁnite lattice G(N) characterized by the minimal momentum Δp
and the maximal momentum Pmax,
• the regularization parameter ε for the electron propagator,
• the artiﬁcial photon mass mph, and
• the length of the time interval [−T
2 , T
2 ].
The limits. Note that the limit L →+∞yields the inﬁnite box R3 in position
space, that is, the normalization volume V goes to inﬁnity, V →∞. Moreover,
Δp →0.

946
16. The Continuum Limit
The limit N →+∞yields Pmax →+∞. In a speciﬁc physical experiment, the
parameters Δp, Pmax and T are ﬁxed. However, in order to get universal formulas,
we are interested in performing the following three fundamental limits: L →+∞,
N →∞, and T →+∞. In terms of physics, this means the following:
(H) High-energy limit: Pmax →+∞and ε →+0.
(L) Low-energy limit: Δp →0 and mph →+0.
(T) Large-time limit: T →+∞.
Recall that p = (E, p) denotes the 4-momentum, that is, E (resp. p) denotes the
energy (resp. the momentum vector) of the particles. Thus, the high-energy limit
concerns the physical behavior at large 4-momenta, p →+∞. In contrast to this,
the low-energy limit refers to small 4-momenta, p →0.
16.2 The Formal Limits Fail
It turns out that the limits (H), (L), (T) above do not always exist for higher-order
terms in perturbation theory. In particular, the high-energy limit causes trouble.
Here, the discrete algebraic Feynman integrals may pass to divergent integrals. To
cure this defect, physicists invented the method of renormalization.
There exist several approaches to renormalization theory. Physicists prefer com-
putations which are based on the regularization of divergent algebraic Feynman
integrals. For a mathematician, it is important to understand this approach. Oth-
erwise, he is lost in the physics literature, and he does not understand the language
of physicists. In Chap. 19 we will discuss diﬀerent approaches to renormalization
theory. We want to emphasize that there exists a very elegant approach which at-
tacks the high-energy limit by using the modern theory of tempered distributions.
This is the Epstein–Glaser approach which completely avoids the use of lattices
and divergent integrals (see Sect. 19.2 ).
In order to master complicated problems in both mathematics and physics,
one tries to discover symmetries behind the problems and to use simpliﬁcations
based on symmetry arguments. Concerning renormalization theory, there are two
fundamental symmetries, namely,
• the gauge invariance and
• the Hopf algebra structure of the set of Feynman graphs.
The gauge invariance leads to crucial symmetry relations called the Slavnov–Taylor
identities in gauge theory. In quantum electrodynamics, the Ward identity (and the
more general Ward–Takahashi identities) are special cases of the Slavnov–Taylor
identities. The Hopf algebra structure behind Feynman graphs helps to master the
complicated combinatorics of renormalization theory in higher-order perturbation
theory (also called multi-loop perturbation theory).
The procedure of renormalization depends on the choice of appropriate normal-
ization conditions. A change of these normalization conditions is governed by an
additional internal symmetry which is described by the renormalization group. This
group is used by physicists in order to extrapolate the computations to high ener-
gies. This leads to eﬀective coupling constants which depend on the energy of the
elementary particles colliding in particle accelerators (so-called running coupling
constants).
The beginner in renormalization theory is confronted with an ocean of messy
formulas. We want to help the beginner to understand renormalization theory by
ﬁrst discussing the basic ideas. The unavoidable lengthy computations will be post-
poned to Vol. III.

16.3 Basic Ideas of Renormalization
947
16.3 Basic Ideas of Renormalization
Nature is not embarrassed by diﬃculties of mathematical analysis.
Augustin Fresnel (1788–1827)
Our goal is to discuss the following crucial notions:
• eﬀective electron mass meﬀ,
• bare electron mass me,
• eﬀective electron charge −eeﬀ,
• bare electron charge −e,
• counterterms of the Lagrangian (additional quantum ﬂuctuations),
• the compensation principle,
• the invariance principles,
• dimensional regularization of discrete algebraic Feynman integrals, and
• multiplicative renormalization constants.
16.3.1 The Eﬀective Mass and the Eﬀective Charge of the
Electron
For the electron, physicists measure the mass meﬀand the electric charge −eeﬀ.
Explicitly, the measurements yield the following values in the SI system:
meﬀ= 0.511 MeV/c2,
eeﬀ=
√
4πε0ℏcα = 1.602 · 10−19 As
(16.1)
with the dimensionless (electromagnetic) ﬁne structure constant α = 1/137.04.
Physicists call meﬀ(resp. eeﬀ) the eﬀective electron mass (resp. the eﬀective electron
charge). In the energetic system with ℏ= c = ε0 = 1, we get
meﬀ= 0.511 MeV,
e =
√
4πα.
Physicists assume that these two quantities are the result of complicated interac-
tions between parts of the quantum ﬁeld in quantum electrodynamics. Nowadays
nobody knows how to compute these values from ﬁrst principles. Renormalization
theory only provides us with ﬁnite expressions in each order of perturbation theory,
and these expressions depend on two free parameters meﬀand eeﬀwhich have to
be measured by physical experiments.
16.3.2 The Counterterms of the Modiﬁed Lagrangian
The bare Lagrangian. In (11.3) on page 794 we introduced the following La-
grangian density of quantum electrodynamics:
L = −1
2(∂μAν)(∂μAν) + 1
2
„
1 −1
ξ
«
(∂μAμ)2
+iψ ̸∂ψ −meψψ + eψ ̸Aψ.
Here, we use the Feynman slash symbols ̸ ∂:= γμ∂μ and ̸ A = γμAμ. The real
parameter ξ is a ﬁxed nonzero real number called the gauge parameter. The choice
ξ = 1 is called the Feynman gauge. The parameter me is called the bare mass of
the electron, and the parameter −e is called the bare electric charge of the electron.

948
16. The Continuum Limit
Additive renormalization. Physicists assume that the bare quantities me and
e cannot be measured in physical experiments. One has to add contributions coming
from complicated interaction processes. Therefore, we introduce the following two
parameters:
meﬀ:= me + δm,
eeﬀ:= e + δe.
Hence
me = meﬀ−δm,
e = eeﬀ−δe.
This way we get the new Lagrangian density:
Lren := −1
2(∂μAν)(∂μAν) + 1
2
„

ξ
«
(∂μAμ)2
+iψ ̸∂ψ −meﬀψψ + eeﬀψ ̸Aψ + Lcounter
along with
Lcounter := δm ψψ −δe ψ ̸Aψ.
Counterterms. The additional terms of Lcounter are called counterterms. Now
if one uses the modiﬁed Lagrangian density, then the S-matrix S(T) changes. Ap-
plying the Wick theorem to the new S-matrix, we get modiﬁed Feynman rules.
16.3.3 The Compensation Principle
The main idea is to choose the parameters δm and δe in such a way that the
continuum limit exists in an appropriate sense. The prototype for this technique
is the proof of the Mittag-Leﬄer theorem for the representation of meromorphic
functions (see Sect. 2.1.3 on page 56). In this classical mathematical proof from
the 19th century, Mittag-Leﬄer used additional subtraction terms in order to force
the convergence from a ﬁnite sum approximation to an inﬁnite series. In general
terms, this corresponds to a passage from a ﬁnite number of degrees of freedom
to an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom. In renormalization theory, physicists
try to give the subtraction terms a physical meaning by using additional terms of
the Lagrangian density called counterterms. The philosophy of physicists reads as
follows:
• The Feynman rules are based on the classical Lagrangian density of quantum
electrodynamics.
• This classical Lagrangian density does not see all of the complicated physical in-
teractions between electrons, positrons, and photons. In particular, this concerns
the so-called radiative corrections (e.g., the Lamb shift in the spectrum of the
hydrogen atom and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron).
• Therefore, we have to supplement systematically the classical Lagrangian density
by adding so-called counterterms.
• From the physical point of view, the counterterms describe additional quantum
ﬂuctuations.
• From the mathematical point of view, the counterterms enforce the convergence
of the expressions with respect to the limits (H), (L), and (T) above.
It turns out that this procedure is quite reasonable from the physical point of view.
The crucial point is that:
• After ﬁnishing the procedure of renormalization, the quantities δm and δe com-
pletely disappear.
• We get well-deﬁned expressions for physical quantities which depend on the two
free real parameters meﬀand eeﬀ.

16.3 Basic Ideas of Renormalization
949
• These two parameters cannot be determined by the theory. They have to be
measured by physical experiments.
The reader should have in mind that, in contrast to the proof of the Mittag-
Leﬄer theorem in complex function theory, a direct attack of the continuum limit by
means of subtraction terms is extremely clumsy. For simplifying the computations,
we will modify the approach by using the method of dimensional regularization (see
Sects. 16.3.5 and 17.4).
16.3.4 Fundamental Invariance Principles
In quantum ﬁeld theory, one has to realize the following three fundamental postu-
lates:
(R) relativistic invariance,
(U) unitarity of the S-matrix, and
(G) gauge invariance.
Condition (R) guarantees that the theory does not depend on the choice of the in-
ertial system. The property (U) ensures that the elements of the S-matrix allow a
reasonable probabilistic interpretation, and hence the computed cross sections pos-
sess a well-deﬁned physical meaning for scattering processes. The gauge invariance
postulates that the theory is invariant under gauge transformations (generalized
phase transitions). In electrodynamics, gauge invariance means that electromag-
netic phenomena only depend on the electromagnetic ﬁeld E, B, but not on the
diﬀerent choices of the four-potential U, A.
Unfortunately, the compatibility between (R), (U), and (G) causes trouble.
In order to avoid this trouble, a careful approach to quantum ﬁeld theory is needed.
In particular, it turns out that the postulate of gauge invariance leads to the so-
called Ward identities which are crucial for the process of renormalization.
16.3.5 Dimensional Regularization of Discrete Algebraic Feynman
Integrals
Let us sketch how the modern method of dimensional regularization is used in
renormalization theory. The Feynman rules from Table 14.8 on page 896 generate
discrete algebraic Feynman integrals denoted by
J(T, V, Δp, Pmax; ε, mph).
In order to compute cross sections, as a rule, we are interested in time averages of
the form
J(T, V, Δp, Pmax; ε, mph)
T
.
We now proceed in the following steps:
Step 1: The continuum limit: The limits L →∞, N →∞, T →∞correspond to
the limits V →∞, Δp →0, Pmax →∞, and T →∞. Performing these limits,
we get the integral
Jn(ε, mph) =
Z
Rn . . .
Note that this integral may diverge, that is, our limit is regarded as a for-
mal limit. However, this procedure yields a uniquely determined convergent or
divergent integral.

16. The Continuum Limit
Step 2: Dimensional regularization: If the integral J is divergent, then we replace
the dimension n by n −ν, and we apply the method of dimensional regulariza-
tion (see Sect. 2.2.9 on page 73). This way, we get
Jn−ν(ε, mph) =

νk .
Here, the natural number r = 1, 2, . . . tells us the order of the pole at the point
ν = 0.

This yields the regularization

Letting ν →+0, we get the regularized value
Jreg(ε, mph) = lim
ν→+0(1 −P)Jn−ν(ε, mph) = a0.
Step 4: Choice of the counterterms via compensation principle: We try to choose
δm and δe as functions of the small parameter ν in such a way that the terms
containing δm(ν) and δe(ν) replace the action of the operator 1 −P, that is,
these terms cancel the singular terms with respect to the parameter ν. After
that we carry out the limit ν →+0.
This way, we obtain a ﬁnal result which only depends on the regularization parame-
ter ε (shift of the electron rest energy to the upper half-plane) and the virtual photon
mass mph. It remains to study the limits ε →+0 and mph →+0. Roughly speaking,
this is a problem of the theory of generalized functions (including Cauchy’s residue
calculus, Wick rotation, and so on). Moreover, it turns out that the existence of the
limit mph →0 is related to special physical eﬀects. Roughly speaking, for a ﬁxed
order of perturbation theory, one has to take all possible Feynman diagrams into
account. Then surprising cancellations appear (in particular, see the discussion of
braking radiation on page 976).
16.3.6 Multiplicative Renormalization
As noticed by Dyson in his fundamental paper on renormalization theory,1 it is
convenient to replace the additive relation me = meﬀ−δm by the multiplicative
relation me := Zmmeﬀ. We will also change ψ, A, and ξ. To this end, we choose ﬁve
real parameters Zm, Ze, Zξ, Zψ, and ZA. We set
me = Zmmeﬀ,
e = Zeeeﬀ,

(16.3)
In Vol. III we will show that this postulate can be motivated by the postulate of
gauge invariance via the crucial Ward identities. In fact, the postulate (16.3) ensures
the renormalizability of quantum electrodynamics (see the quotation on page 997).
16.4 The Theory of Approximation Schemes in
Mathematics
Consider the operator equation
Ax = b,
x ∈X.
(16.4)
We are given the linear or nonlinear operator A : X →Y, where X and Y are, say,
Hilbert spaces or Banach spaces. For given b ∈Y , we are looking for a solution x
of the equation (16.4). In order to get approximate solutions of (16.4), we add the
equations
Anxn = bn,
xn ∈Xn,
n = 1, , 2 . . .
(16.5)
There arises the following question: Which general class of operators has the fol-
lowing property: It is possible to construct an approximation scheme (16.5) such
that the approximate solutions converge against the unique solution of the original
equation (16.4), that is, we have the convergence

952
16. The Continuum Limit
lim
n→∞xn = x
in an appropriate sense. There exists a nontrivial answer in terms of the class of so-
called A-proper operators introduced by Browder and Petryshyn in the late 1960s
by summarizing a long development in numerical analysis. This theory can be found
in the last three chapters of the author’s monograph:
E. Zeidler, Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Applications, Vol. IIB:
Monotone Operators, Springer, New York, 1990.
We also refer to the survey article by W. Petryshyn, On the approximation-
solvability of equations involving A-proper and pseudo-A-proper mappings, Bull.
Amer. Math. Soc. 81 (1975), 223–312.
The situation completely changes in renormalization theory. Here, we have a
sophisticated approximation scheme in perturbed quantum ﬁeld theory, but we do
not know the correct global operator equation for the quantum ﬁeld. It is a task
for the future to clarify this situation.

17. Radiative Corrections of Lowest Order
Unfortunately, the computations of radiative corrections in quantum elec-
trodynamics are rather lengthy. For getting high accuracy by including
multi-loop corrections, one needs sophisticated supercomputer programs.
Folklore
In Chap. 15 we have studied some applications to physical processes by using the
lowest order of perturbation theory. The next step is to compute corrections in
higher order of perturbation theory. Such so-called radiative corrections suﬀer under
the appearance of divergent algebraic Feynman integrals. Therefore, we have to use
the method of renormalization in order to get ﬁnite expressions which depend on
the free parameters meﬀand eeﬀ. These parameters must be determined by physical
experiments. Typical radiative corrections in lowest possible order (so-called one-
loop corrections) are:
• the radiative correction of the Coulomb potential (Uehling 1935);
• the Lamb shift of the spectrum of the hydrogen atom (Bethe 1947);
• the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron (Schwinger 1947);
• scattering of photons by photons (Euler 1936, Karpus and Neumann 1950).
For these physical eﬀects, theoretical and experimental values are in extremely good
agreement. The rather lengthy computations will be postponed to Vol. III. In this
chapter, we will only discuss the main ideas.
17.1 Primitive Divergent Feynman Graphs
A Feynman graph is called divergent iﬀthe corresponding algebraic Feynman in-
tegral is divergent. In quantum electrodynamics, the following divergent Feynman
graphs play a special role:
• the primitive divergent self-energy graph of the photon (Fig. 17.1),
• the primitive divergent self-energy graph of the electron (Fig. 17.2),
• the primitive divergent vertex graph (Fig. 17.3), and

These Feynman graphs are called primitive divergent graphs, since they are sub-
graphs of more complicated divergent Feynman graphs in quantum electrodynam-
ics. Observe that these Feynman graphs have the following important property:
They are connected, and they remain connected after cutting any internal
line.
Such graphs are called one-particle irreducible graphs.
17.2 Vacuum Polarization
Quantum theory so perfectly illustrates the fact that one might have un-
derstood a certain subject with complete clarity, yet at the same time
knows that one can speak of it only allegorically and in pictures.
Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976)
Physicists use Feynman diagrams in order to formulate the processes of quantum
electrodynamics in a highly intuitive manner. Such pictures are very helpful for un-
derstanding typical quantum ﬁeld eﬀects in a heuristic way. The intuitive language
used by physicists tells us the following:
• The internal lines of Feynman graphs correspond to virtual particles, since the
Feynman rules tell us that conservation of energy and momentum are not valid
for the integration over the functions corresponding to internal lines.
• The self-energy graph of the photon pictured in Fig. 17.1 describes the inter-
action of a photon with a virtual electron-positron pair. The existence of vir-
tual electron-positron pairs is called vacuum polarization by physicists. Using an
analogy with classical electrodynamics, physicists assume heuristically that the
vacuum is ﬁlled with virtual electron-positron dipoles which cause a polarization
of the vacuum.1 We cannot directly observe the vacuum (i.e., the ground state
of the quantum ﬁeld); this is a virtual world. But, by quantum ﬂuctuations, the
virtual electron-positron dipoles of the vacuum may jump for a short time to our
real world; this way, they add quantum corrections to real physical processes.
• The self-energy graph of the electron pictured in Fig. 17.2 describes the inter-
action of an electron with itself by emitting virtual photons “for a short time”
and absorbing them again. Intuitively, this process is mainly responsible for the
“electromagnetic mass” of the electron described by mass renormalization. This
1 In classical electrodynamics, a pair of two charges, namely, a negative charge
−Q at the point x and a positive charge Q at the point x + Δx is called a
dipole if the distance |Δx| between the two charges is small. The polarization of
macroscopic material used in technology corresponds to the existence of many
molecular dipoles.

17.3 Radiative Corrections of the Propagators
In 1949 Dyson discovered that both the regularized perturbed photon propagator
and the regularized perturbed electron propagator possess a special multiplicative
structure. This, together with the Ward identity for the vertex diagram, is responsi-
ble for the success of the renormalization of mass and electric charge of the electron
in quantum electrodynamics. From the computational point of view, dimensional
regularization is the most elegant regularization method. We have to distinguish
between
• free Feynman propagators and
• full Feynman propagators.
Feynman propagators are also called 2-point correlation functions (or 2-point
Green’s functions). The free propagators describe the free quantum ﬁelds for pho-
tons, electrons, and positrons. These free propagators are basic ingredients of the
Feynman rules summarized in Table 14.8 on page 896. The corresponding full prop-
agators take interactions into account. This leads to corrections of the free propaga-
tors which are responsible for important physical eﬀects called radiative corrections.
The basic formula for full propagators is the Gell-Mann–Low formula.
This formula, which we already encountered in Vol. I, expresses the full propaga-
tor by means of the S-matrix. Applying the Wick theorem to the Gell-Mann–Low
formula, one obtains Feynman diagrams which graphically describe the full prop-
agator. This will be studied in Vol. III. At this point, we will only indicate the
Feynman diagrams for the corrections. More precisely, we will picture the perturbed
propagators in lowest possible order, namely:
• the perturbed photon propagator (Fig. 17.4),
• the perturbed electron propagator (Fig. 17.5), and
• the perturbed vertex graph (Fig. 17.6).

17.3.1 The Photon Propagator
According to the Feynman rules summarized in Table 14.8 on page 896, the free
photon propagator is based on the family of functions
Dαβ(p) := −iηαβ
(2π)4 ·
1
(p0)2 −(Ep −εi)2 ,
α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3,
with the photon energy Ep :=
p
p2 + mph. Here, mph is the virtual photon mass,
and ε > 0 is the regularization parameter. The perturbed photon propagator cor-
responds to the Feynman diagram depicted in Fig. 17.4. Applying the Feynman
rules to the Feynman diagram and using dimensional regularization for the corre-
sponding algebraic Feynman integrals, a lengthy computation shows that we have
to replace Dαβ by the functions
Dαβ
pert(p) = ZD(ν)Dαβ
ren(p; α),
α, β = 0, 1, 2, 3.
Here, the so-called renormalized propagator function Dαβ
ren is a ﬁrst-order perturba-
tion of Dαβ (with respect to the ﬁne structure constant α). The explicit computation
can be found in Vol. III.
From the physical point of view, the functions Dαβ
ren take the vacuum polar-
ization into account.
Observe that the real number ZD depends on the parameter ν of dimensional
regularization. We have the limit
lim
ν→+0 ZD(ν) = ∞.
(17.1)
The point is that the divergent behavior of the Feynman diagram is concentrated in
the factor ZD(ν). We will discuss in Sect. 17.4 that this inﬁnite limit can be compen-
sated by counterterms of the Lagrangian density. In other words, the inﬁnite limit
(17.1) does not eﬀect quantities which can be measured in physical experiments.
17.3.2 The Electron Propagator
Parallel to the preceding section, the free electron propagator is based on the func-
tion
S(p) :=
i
(2π)4 ·

(p0)2 −(Ep −εi)2
by Table 14.8 on page 896. Here, Ep :=

p2 + m2e is the electron energy with re-
spect to the bare electron mass me, and ε is the positive regularization parameter.
The perturbed electron propagator corresponds to the Feynman diagram depicted
in Fig. 17.5. Applying the Feynman rules to the Feynman diagram and using dimen-
sional regularization for the corresponding algebraic Feynman integrals, a lengthy
computation shows that we have to replace S(p) by the function

Here, Sren is a ﬁrst-order perturbation of S (with respect to the ﬁne structure
constant α). Note that:
The renormalized propagator function Sren does not depend on the bare
electron mass me, but on the new mass parameter meﬀ.
This fact is called mass renormalization. The explicit computation can be found in
Vol. III. There holds the limit
lim
ν→+0 ZS(ν) = ∞.
(17.2)
17.3.3 The Vertex Correction and the Ward Identity
The approach to quantum electrodynamics is substantially simpliﬁed by the fact
that there exists a relation between the algebraic Feynman integrals corresponding
to the perturbed electron propagator (Fig. 17.5) and the perturbed vertex graph
(Fig. 17.6). This crucial relation is called the Ward identity. The explicit form will
be given in Vol. III.
The Ward identity is closely related to the gauge invariance of quantum
electrodynamics.
In particular, the Ward identity implies the crucial relation (17.3) below concerning
the multiplicative renormalization constants.
17.4 The Counterterms of the Lagrangian and the
Compensation Principle
In Sect.16.3.6 we have introduced the multiplicative renormalization constants

related to counterterms of the Lagrangian density in quantum electrodynamics.
The crucial point is that these renormalization constants can be used to
compensate the factors ZD(ν) and ZS(ν) related to the perturbed photon
propagator and the perturbed electron propagator, respectively.
In addition, the Ward identity yields the following crucial relation:
Ze = Z−1/2
A
.
(17.3)
Observe the following two key points:
(i) The transition amplitudes and hence the transition probabilities for real phys-
ical processes do not depend on the multiplicative renormalization constants
Ze, Zm, ZA, Zψ, ZD, ZS; they cancel each other
(ii) The renormalization constants go to inﬁnity as the parameter ν of dimensional
regularization goes to zero. However, because of the cancellation of the multi-
plicative renormalization constants, the limit ν →0 yields ﬁnite values of the
transition amplitudes.
Computations in quantum electrodynamics are frequently simpliﬁed by surprising
cancellations. As a rule, the Ward identity (and the more general Ward–Takahashi
identities) are responsible for these cancellations.

laws themselves.

Consider the primitive divergent self-energy graph of the photon concerning vac-
uum polarization depicted in Fig. 17.1. Replacing the photon line by an external
electromagnetic ﬁeld described by the 4-potential U, A, we get the Feynman graph
depicted in Fig. 17.7. This diagram describes the radiative correction of an external
electromagnetic ﬁeld by vacuum polarization. Using the Coulomb potential of an
electric charge Q,
U(x) =

17.5.2 The Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Electron
The most spectacular experiment for the anomalous magnetic moment of
the electron is based on measurements performed on a single electron,
caught in an electromagnetic trap.4
Martinus Veltman, 2003
The relativistic Dirac equation implies that the electron possesses an internal an-
gular momentum called spin (see Vol. III). This leads to a magnetic moment of
the electron, which can be measured if the electron moves in an external mag-
netic ﬁeld. Explicitly, the magnetic moment vector of the electron is given by the
following formula in the SI system:
M = −eeﬀ
2meﬀ· geS
with the so-called gyromagnetic factor
ge = 2(1 + a).
Here, meﬀ(resp. −eeﬀ) is the eﬀective mass (resp. eﬀective charge) of the electron.
The spin vector S has the length ℏ/2.
As we will show in Vol. III, the relativistic Dirac equation yields the value a = 0.
In 1947, using sophisticated arguments in the setting of quantum electrodynamics,
Schwinger computed the value
a = α
2π .
(17.4)
The deviation of the gyromagnetic factor ge from Dirac’s value ge = 2 is called the
anomalous magnetic moment of the electron.
3 We use the energetic system of physical units.

For computing such a high-accuracy result based on about 900 complicated Feyn-

puter time (see Sect. 18.4).

New York, measured the following value:5

See the references Odom et al. (2006) and Gabrielse et al. (2006) quoted on page 961.
The American Institute of Physics called this “the outstanding physics achievement

the theoretical value atheo.

The sophistication in both theory and experiment for the anomalous mag-

while the computation of the α4 term (891 Feynman diagrams) has been

percomputer time.6

2mμ,eﬀ· gμS
along with the gyromagnetic factor gμ = 2(1 + a) with

Here, eeﬀis the eﬀective charge of the electron, and mμ,eﬀis the eﬀective mass
of the muon. The necessary huge computations take all of the interactions of the
Standard Model in particle physics into account. The main contribution comes from
quantum electrodynamics. Corrections are due to strong and weak interaction. The
experimental value reads as
aexp = 0.001 165 915 97 ± 0.000 000 000 67.
Therefore, the experimental and the theoretical result agree within 9 signiﬁcant
digits. This serves as a high-precision test for the Standard Model in particle physics
and the method of renormalized Feynman diagrams. This is a highlight in the
Standard Model in particle physics.
Hints for further reading. For high-precision tests in quantum electrody-
namics and in the Standard Model of particle physics, we refer to:

17.5.4 The Lamb Shift
On April 26, 1947, Lamb and Retherford experimentally discovered some ﬁne struc-
ture in the spectrum of the hydrogen atom, which is called the Lamb shift nowadays;
they used microwave technique.7 This spectacular experimental result was reported
at the famous Shelter Island Conference in 1947 (Long Island, New York State).
A few days after the conference, Hans Bethe (1906–2005), who was amazed by
the discovery, did the nonrelativistic computation of the Lamb shift during a train
ride from New York to Schenectady. Bethe used second-order perturbation theory
for the Schr¨odinger equation. In order to master divergent integrals, Bethe applied
Kramers’ approach of mass renormalization to the electron of the hydrogen atom.8
In his beautiful book on the history of quantum electrodynamics, Silvan Schweber
reports the following on Bethe’s computation of the Lamb shift:9
Bethe was not quite conﬁdent of the accuracy of his formula, because he
was not quite sure of the correctness of a factor of
√
2 in his expansion
of the radiation operator in terms of creation and annihilation operators.
This he checked on Monday morning in Heitler’s book.10 He also got Miss
Steward and Dr. Stehn to evaluate numerically the missing mean excitation
energy for the 2s state of the electron of the hydrogen atom. It was found
to be 17.5 R (Rydberg constant), “an amazingly high value.” Inserting this
in his formula, Bethe found
ΔELamb = 1040 MHz
for the Lamb shift ”in excellent agreement with the observed 1000 MHz
(Mega Hertz)”. . .
On the occasion of Lamb’s sixtieth birthday in 1973, Freeman Dyson wrote
to congratulate him. He noted: “Your work on the hydrogen ﬁne structure
led directly to the wave of progress in quantum electrodynamics on which
I took a ride to fame and fortune. You did the hard, tedious, exploratory
work. . . Those years, when the Lamb shift was the central theme of physics,
were golden years for the physicists of my generation. You were the ﬁrst

to see that that tiny shift, so elusive and hard to measure, would clarify
in a fundamental way our thinking about particles and ﬁelds.”
Using the relativistic renormalization technique in quantum electrodynamics, Weiss-
kopf and French obtained the value 1051.13 MHZ in 1948, whereas Feynman and
Schwinger computed a slightly smaller (incorrect) value. Today, the theoretical
value is equal to
ΔELamb,theor = (1057.855 ± 0.014) MHz.
Here, vacuum polarization contributes the value of −27.1 MHz.11 The modern
experimental value is equal to
ΔELamb,exp = (1057.845 ± 0.009)) MHz.
Welton’s semiclassical model on vacuum eﬀects and pseudo-Brownian
motion. It is quite interesting that the Lamb shift can be intuitively understood
as a kind of Brownian motion of the electron. Using some heuristic model, Welton
argued as follows:12 The electron moves stochastically in the sea of virtual photons
of the vacuum under the inﬂuence of quantum ﬂuctuations (like the classical Brow-
nian particle moves under the inﬂuence of the collisions with the ﬂuid particles).
Using the energy of the photon quantum ﬁeld, the computation shows that the
averaged square of the position ﬂuctuation of the pseudo-Brownian motion of the
electron is given by the following formula:13
(Δx)2 = 2

Note that the energy integral is divergent. In order to get a ﬁnite result, we use an
energy cut-oﬀ, that is, we replace the integral by
(Δx)2 = 2

We argue that the energy of the electron is actually limited by the speciﬁc physical
situation. As upper bound, we choose the rest energy of the electron, Emax := meﬀ,
and as lower bound we choose the lowest possible energy of the electron in the
hydrogen atom on the nth orbit,
Emin = meﬀe4

,
n = 1, 2, . . .
The position ﬂuctuation changes the potential energy of the electron; this energy
change is responsible for the Lamb shift. The explicit computation for n = 2 and the
s-state of the electron (i.e., the angular momentum vanishes, l = 0) yields indeed
Bethe’s value of 1040 MHz (see Vol. III for details).
Perspectives. In Vol. III we will thoroughly study the spectrum of the hydro-
gen atom including the Lamb shift. This is a fascinating story in both physics and
mathematics. We will study the following approaches:
• the classical Kepler motion based on the rotational symmetry of the gravitational
ﬁeld of the sun (the SO(3)-Poisson algebra);

Interestingly enough, Feynman, himself, did not succeed in computing the path in-
tegral for the nonrelativistic hydrogen atom; he gave this task to the young physicist
Hagen Kleinert in 1972. To solve this problem, the main trick of Kleinert was to
use a pseudo-time and a canonical transformation known in celestial mechanics in
order to get a Hamiltonian of quadratic type which leads to a Gaussian integral.
17.5.5 Photon-Photon Scattering
The Maxwell equations represent a linear system of partial diﬀerential equations
for the electromagnetic ﬁeld. In this classical setting, the superposition principle
is valid for electromagnetic waves; therefore, light-light scattering is impossible.

17.5 Application to Physical Problems
965
Light-light scattering (i.e., photon-photon scattering) is a typical quantum eﬀect
which can be described by quantum electrodynamics. A typical Feynman graph
is pictured in Fig. 17.9. Since the corresponding algebraic Feynman integral is
divergent, we have to apply the methods of renormalization theory. For a detailed
study, we refer to L. Landau and M. Lifshitz, Course of Theoretical Physics, Vol 4:
Quantum Electrodynamics, Sect. 124, Butterworth–Heinemann, Oxford, 1982. The
cross section for photon-photon scattering is given by
σ = 10−72 cm2.
This is an extremely small value; therefore, an experimental veriﬁcation of photon-
photon scattering is still missing.

18. A Glance at Renormalization to all Orders
of Perturbation Theory
The devil rides high on detail.
Folklore
In this chapter, we will sketch the basic ideas of general renormalization theory. A
detailed study will be postponed to Vol. IV on quantum mathematics. Renormal-
ization theory cannot be understood without knowing its long and strange history.
At this point we merely restrict ourselves to a few quotations and comments. In
the next chapter, we will sketch some basic ideas together with detailed hints for
further reading.
The following quotation is taken from the famous article Orientation written
by Arthur Wightman as an introduction to the volume Renormalization Theory
edited by G. Velo and A. Wightman, Reidel, Dordrecht, pp. 1–24 (reprinted with
permission). This volume describes the state of the art in renormalization theory
in 1976.
Renormalization theory is a notoriously complicated and technical sub-
ject. . . The prudent student would do well to distinguish sharply between
what has been proved and what has been plausible, and in general he
should watch out!
My ﬁrst cautionary tale has to do with the early days of renormalization
theory. When Freeman Dyson analyzed the renormalization theory of the
S-matrix for the quantum electrodynamics of spin one-half particles in his
two great papers,1 he laid the foundations for most later work on the sub-
ject, but this treatment of one phenomenon, overlapping divergences, was
incomplete. Among the methods oﬀered to clarify the situation, that of
John Ward2 seemed outstandingly simple, so much so that it was adopted
in Jauch and Rohrlich’s standard textbook.3 Several years later, Mills and
Yang noticed that unless further reﬁnements are introduced the method
does not work for the photon self-energy.4 The lowest order for which the
trouble manifests itself is the fourteenth (e.g., this concerns the graph de-
picted in Fig. 18.1). Mills and Yang repaired the method and sketched

some of the steps in a proof that it would actually yield a ﬁnite renormal-
ized amplitude.5 An innocent, reading the book by Jauch and Rohrlich,
would never suspect that such reﬁnements are necessary.
Another attempt to cope with the overlapping divergences was made by
Salam.6 I will not describe it, if for no other reason that I never have suc-
ceeded in understanding it. . . The belief is widespread that when Salam’s
work is combined with signiﬁcant work by Steven Weinberg,7 the result
should be a mathematically coherent version of renormalization theory.
At least that is what one reads in the textbook by Bjorken and Drell for
quantum electrodynamics8. . .
Another foundation for renormalization theory with a rather diﬀerent
starting point was put forward by Stueckelberg and Green.9 It was re-
founded and brought to a certain stage of completion in the standard
textbook of Bogoliubov and Shirkov in 1957.10 The mathematical nut that
had to be cracked is in the paper of Bogoliubov and Parasiuk11 (amazingly,
not quoted in the 1959 English translation of the 1957 monograph by Bo-
goliubov and Shirkov). This paper introduces a systematical and analytic
scheme for overcoming the overlapping divergence problem. This paper
is very important for later developments. Unfortunately, it was found by
Klaus Hepp12 that Theorem 4 of the Bogoliubov/Parasiuk paper is false,
and that consequently the proof of the main result is incomplete as it
stands. However, Hepp showed that Theorem 4 is not essential to derive
the main result and he could ﬁll all the gaps. Thus, it is appropriate to
introduce the initials BPH to stand for the renormalization method de-
scribed in Bogoliubov/Parasiuk (1957) and Hepp (1966).13

An alternative method to BPHZ is analytic renormalization due to Eugene
Speer.14. . . Analytic renormalization was later shown to be equivalent to
BPHZ renormalization.15 . . .
To make the Feynman history integral rigorous,16 Gelfand and Yaglom
proposed to regard it as the limit of integrals in which Planck’s constant h
has −iδ. They argued that this gives rise to a complex measure on paths:
. . . “It is natural that such a complex measure for arbitrary δ > 0 will
be just as ’good’ as Wiener measure, that is, it will have just a precise a
meaning as measure in the space of continuous functions, and it will allow
integration over it of a wide class of functionals including all continuous
and bounded functionals”17. . . It turned out, alas, that this statement is
wrong. It was shown by Cameron18 that this proposal deﬁnes a completely
additive complex measure only when h = iδ is purely imaginary (δ > 0),
that is, for the case considered by Wiener.19 From a practical point of view
this means that one does not have available all the powerful analytical
devices of the theory of integration.

The following quotation is taken from J. Collins, Renormalization, Cambridge Uni-
versity Press, New York, 1984 (reprinted with permission). We recommend this
book as an introduction to renormalization theory (see also the hints for further
reading on page 1029). However, the reader should note that this book was written
before Kreimer’s Hopf algebra revolution in renormalization theory in 1998 (see
Sect. 19.3).
The structure of a quantum ﬁeld theory often simpliﬁes when one considers
processes involving large momenta (i.e., large energies) or short distances.
These simpliﬁcations are important in improving one’s ability to calculate
predictions from the theory, and in essence form the subject of this book. . .
The subjects of renormalization, the renormalization group, and the op-
erator product expansion are intimately linked, and we will treat them
all in this book. The aim will be to explain the general methods that are
not only applicable to the examples we will examine but in many other
situations. We will not aim at complete rigor. However, there are many
pitfalls and traps ready to ensnare an unwary physicist. Thus, a precise
set of concepts and notations is necessary, for many of the dangers are es-
fore, nowadays the approach is characterized by the initials BPHZ (Bogoliubov,
Parasiuk, Hepp, Zimmermann). See W. Zimmermann, Convergence of Bogoli-

sentially combinatorial. The appropriate basis is then that of Zimmermann
(1969)/(1973).20
One other problem is that of choice of an ultra-violet (i.e., high-energy)
cut-oﬀ. From a fundamental point of view, the lattice cut-oﬀseems best as
it appears in nonperturbative treatment using the functional integral.21 In
perturbation theory one can arrange to use no regulator whatsoever.22 In
practice, dimensional regularization has deservedly become very popular.
This consists of replacing the physical space-time dimensionality 4 by an
arbitrary complex number d. The main attraction of this method is that
virtually no violence is done to the structure of a Feynman graph; a second
attraction is that it also regulates infra-red (i.e., low-energy) divergences. . .
The disadvantage is that this method has not been formulated outside
of perturbation theory (at least not yet). Much of the treatment in this
book, especially the examples, will be based on the use of dimensional
regularization. However, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that none
of the fundamental results depend on this choice.

18.1 One-Particle Irreducible Feynman Graphs and
Divergences
Divergences in quantum ﬁeld theory are only caused by one-particle irre-
ducible Feynman subgraphs.
The rule of thumb
Intuitively, a Feynman graph in quantum electrodynamics (also called Feynman
diagram) consists of a ﬁnite number of vertices and connecting internal lines, as
well as external lines. The electron and positron lines are oriented, whereas the
photon lines are not oriented:
• external lines describe incoming and outgoing real particles;
• internal lines describe virtual particles.
In contrast to internal lines, external lines have only one vertex. The graph is called
amputated iﬀit has no external lines. Such graphs describe processes for virtual
particles in the vacuum (ground state). Intuitively, such processes correspond to
quantum ﬂuctuations of the vacuum which essentially inﬂuence the behavior of
elementary particles in our real world. Analytically, correlation functions (also called

Connectedness of Feynman graphs. One has to distinguish between the fol-
lowing types of Feynman graphs:
(i) Connectedness: connected or disconnected.
(ii) Irreducibility: one-particle irreducible or reducible.
(iii) Overlapping subgraphs.
Let us discuss this. The graph is called disconnected iﬀit consists of at least two
disjoint parts (Fig. 18.2(b)). Otherwise the graph is called connected (Fig. 18.2 (a)).
The graph is called one-particle irreducible iﬀit remains connected after cutting
any internal line. Otherwise the graph is called reducible. Let us consider some
examples:
(R) The graph depicted in Fig. 18.3(b) is reducible.
(I) The graph depicted in Fig. 18.3(a) is one-particle irreducible. The same property
have the following Feynman graphs in quantum electrodynamics:

17.1 on page 953),
• the primitive divergent electron self-energy graph (Fig. 17.2 on page 954),
• the primitive divergent vertex graph (Fig. 17.3 on page 955),
• the primitive divergent photon-photon scattering graph (Fig. 17.9 on page

• the critical photon self-energy graph depicted in Fig. 18.1 on page 968 is
one-particle irreducible.

The importance of one-particle irreducible graphs for quantum ﬁeld theory will be
explained in Sect. 19.6. Roughly speaking, the following hold:
• The one-particle irreducible graphs form the basis elements of the quantum ﬁeld
theory under consideration.
• Intuitively, these basis elements represent the basic correlations of the quantum
ﬂuctuations.
• If we know these basis elements, all the important information for the quantum
processes can be obtained from them.
• This concerns the correlation functions (i.e., the Green’s functions) and the tran-
sition amplitudes of the S-matrix for computing scattering processes of quantum
particles.
• Only the algebraic Feynman integrals corresponding to these basic graphs have
to be renormalized.
Two subgraphs Γ1 and Γ2 of the graph Γ are called overlapping iﬀthe following
three situations are excluded:
Γ1 ⊆Γ2,
Γ2 ⊆Γ1,
Γ1 ∩Γ2 = ∅.
The prototype of a graph Γ with overlapping subgraphs Γ1 and Γ2 is depicted in
Fig. 18.4. Furthermore, the subgraphs Γ1 and Γ2 of Γ depicted in Fig 18.5 are also
overlapping subgraphs of Γ. Overlapping subgraphs caused a lot of trouble in the
history of renormalization theory. In what follows we want to explain this.
18.2 Overlapping Divergences and Manoukian’s
Equivalence Principle
The following three quotations should help the reader to understand the diﬃcul-
ties that physicists encountered in the past in order to understand the concept of
renormalization. The ﬁrst quotation is taken from the beautiful history of quan-
tum ﬁeld theory written by S. Schweber, QED and the Men Who Made It: Dyson,
Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga, Princeton University Press, 1994 (reprinted
by permission of both Princeton University Press and World Scientiﬁc Publishing
Co. Pte. Ltd. Singapore).
Overlapping divergences had reared their ugly head in Dyson’s QED pa-
per.23 He had noted that a general self-energy graph could be regarded
as an insertion of a modiﬁed vertex at either end of the lowest order self-
energy graph. Insertion of modiﬁed vertices at both ends would correspond

to double-counting. “In his paper, while discussing these, Dyson had rec-
ommended precisely this – that one should subtract the vertex-part sub-
inﬁnities twice before subtracting the ﬁnal self-energy inﬁnity.”24 But no
proof of his assertion was given.
Salam decided to make the overlapping divergences his problem.25 He
thought that the best way to solve the problem “would be to ask Dyson’s
direct help.”26 So he rang Dyson up and said: “I am a beginning research
student; I would like to talk with you. I am trying to renormalize meson
theories, and there is the problem of overlapping divergences which you
have solved. Could you give me some time?” Dyson indicated that he was
leaving for the United States on the next day, so if Salam wanted to talk
to him he had to come to Birmingham “tonight.” This Salam did. The
two of them got together the next morning. This was the ﬁrst time that
Salam met Dyson. He asked him “What is your solution of the overlapping
inﬁnity problem?” Dyson answered, “But, I have no solution. I only made
a conjecture. Salam recalled that for a young student who had just started
on research, “this was a terrible shock. Dyson was our hero. His papers
were classics. For him to say that he had only made a conjecture made
me feel that my support of certainty in the subject was slipping away.”
But Salam notes that “Dyson was being characteristically modest about
his own work. He explained to me what the basis of his conjecture was.
What he told me was enough to build on and show that he was absolutely
right.”
During the summer of 1950, Salam tackled the overlapping divergences
problem and “using a generalization of Dyson’s remarks,” was able to
show that QED and spin zero meson theories were indeed renormalizable
to all orders.

ensures the crucial convergence of the algebraic Feynman integrals which appear
during the renormalization procedure.
Renormalization theory is still with us and very much alive since its birth
over three decades ago. It has reached such a high level of sophistica-
tion that any book on the subject has to be mathematically rigorous to
do any justice on it. . . The ﬁrst systematic study of renormalization his-
torically was carried out by Salam in 1951 in a classic paper where the
subtraction scheme of renormalization, in a general form, was formally
sketched.27 Surprisingly, this classic paper was not carefully reexamined
until much later. In 1960 Weinberg established and proved one of the most
important theorems in ﬁeld theory. This theorem, popularly known as the
“power-counting theorem” embodied a power-counting criterion to estab-
lish the absolute convergence of (algebraic) Feynman integrals.28 Salam’s
work was ﬁrst reexamined and brought to a mathematically consistent
form in Manoukian (1976).29 The absolute convergence of correspond-
ing renormalized Feynman amplitudes was then proved by the author30
by explicitly verifying in the process that the power-counting criterion of
Weinberg was satisﬁed, thus completing the Dyson–Salam program:
(DS) : Dyson →Salam →Weinberg →Manoukian (completion).
Shortly, after the appearance of Salam’s work, Bogoliubov, together with
Parasiuk (1957),31 in a classic paper developed a subtraction scheme and
outlined a proof of its convergence. In 1966 Hepp32 gave a convergence
proof of the Bogoliubov–Parasiuk scheme by using in the intermediate
stages ultraviolet cutoﬀs, and in 1969 Zimmermann33 formulated the Bo-
goliubov scheme in momentum space with no ultraviolet cutoﬀs and gave
a convergence proof of this subtraction scheme. Thus, these two latter
authors completed the Bogoliubov–Parasiuk (BP) program:
(BP) : Bogoliubov/Parasiuk →Hepp/Zimmermann (completion).
Finally, the equivalence of the Bogoliubov scheme, in the Zimmermann
form, and our scheme was then proved, after some systematic cancellations
in the subtractions, by the author (see Manoukian (1976)) in a theorem
that we have called the “unifying theorem of renormalization.” Since the
Zimmermann form grew out of Bogoliubov’s work and our form grew out

18.3 The Renormalizability of Quantum Electrodynamics
975
of Salam’s work, this theorem establishes the long-standing problem of the
equivalence between the paths taken in the ingenious approaches of Salam
and Bogoliubov (in momentum space):
(DS) program ⇐⇒(BP) program (Manoukian).
This book deals with a mathematically rigorous formulation of renormal-
ization presented in a uniﬁed manner and a model independent way.
From the analytical point of view, the prototype of a divergent integral with over-
lapping divergences can be found in Sect. 2.2.5 on page 65. In terms of Feynman
graphs, Fig. 18.4 on page 972 shows the prototype of an overlapping divergence.
Bogoliubov’s key recursion formula for the handling of overlapping divergences in
the BPHZ approach can be found on page 982.
Unfortunately, it is hard to read papers and books on renormalization theory,
since the Salam criterion is violated, as a rule: The following quotation describes
this rule:
In 1951 Matthews and Salam formulated a requirement for renormaliza-
tion procedures that has become popularly known as the Salam criterion:34
“The diﬃculty, as in all this work, is to ﬁnd a notation which is both concise
and intelligible to at least two persons, of whom one may be an author.”
Possibly there are many proofs of the renormalizability of quantum elec-
trodynamics which satisfy the Salam criterion. But we must confess that
none of us has yet qualiﬁed as that other person who is the guarantor of
the criterion. While there are today many standard texts which discuss
the renormalizability of quantum electrodynamics, we are not aware of
any which represents a complete proof and in particular justiﬁes the claim
that only gauge invariant counterterms are required. We here submit to
you a direct and complete proof and we invite you to judge whether you
can vouch for the Salam criterion.35

18.3 The Renormalizability of Quantum
Electrodynamics
Quantum electrodynamics is renormalizable by a passage to both the ef-
fective mass and the eﬀective charge of the electron.36

Renormalization is the readjustment of the higher order terms of the formal
power series of quantum ﬁeld theory so that the resulting quantities satisfy
the axioms of quantum ﬁeld theory in every order of perturbation theory

18. Renormalization to All Orders
or, more ambitiously in constructive quantum ﬁeld theory, in the exact,
non-perturbative solution.37
Klaus Hepp, 1971
The main goal of the renormalization of quantum electrodynamics reads as follows:
Show that there exists a general algorithm such that, in each order of per-
turbation theory, one gets ﬁnite S-matrix elements which only depend on
two free parameters, namely,
• meﬀ(eﬀective mass of the electron) and
• −eeﬀ(eﬀective charge of the electron).
These eﬀective values cannot be determined by theoretical arguments. They have
to be determined by physical experiments. Roughly speaking, the main goal for-
mulated above can be realized. There exist algorithms used by physicists on super-
computers in order to compute high-precision results (e.g., the anomalous magnetic
moment of the electron). However, the arguments for justifying the algorithms are
highly technical and full of mathematical pitfalls. In particular, one has to show
that
• the choice of the gauge condition doesn’t matter (gauge invariance),
• the S-matrix elements generate transition probabilities (unitarity of the renor-
malized S-matrix), and
• the choice of the inertial system doesn’t matter (relativistic covariance).
Note that there exist diﬀerent approaches to renormalization theory. In the set-
ting of the lattice approach, the main idea is to choose the free parameters of the
counterterms of the Lagrangian in such a way that the continuum limit exists. For
example, physicists have shown that the mathematical trick of introducing an arti-
ﬁcial photon mass does not inﬂuence the computation of important physical eﬀects.
In fact, the artiﬁcial mass terms cancel each other if one takes all of the essential
physical eﬀects into account. For example, the additional production of low-energy
(soft) photons compensates infrared divergences of the algebraic Feynman integrals.
For example, when electrons scatter at protons or in the ﬁeld of a nucleus, they
can emit real photons. This physical phenomenon is called Bremsstrahlung. This
German word means breaking radiation. In 1931 this eﬀect was ﬁrst studied by
Sommerfeld in a non-relativistic setting. In 1934 Bethe and Heitler computed the
relativistic cross section for breaking radiation related to the incoming stream of
electrons in the Coulomb ﬁeld of an atom and the outgoing photons. We refer to
the study of breaking radiation in:

Electrodynamics, Butterworth–Heinemann, Oxford, 1982.
C. Itzykson and J. Zuber, Quantum Field Theory, MacGraw-Hill, New
York, 1908.
A detailed modern study can be found in Sect. 3.11 of the monograph by
G. Scharf, Finite Quantum Electrodynamics: the Causal Approach, Sprin-
ger, Berlin, 1995.
Here, the causal Epstein–Glaser approach for constructing the S-matrix is used in
order to show that the adiabatic limit (i.e., the infrared limit) exists. This is based
on surprising cancellations of singularities by taking Feynman graphs into account
which correspond to soft photons of breaking radiation.

Ambiguity of renormalization schemes. Fortunately enough, it seems that
the mathematical ambiguity of the choice of renormalization schemes does not
matter the physics.
The computational experience of physicists shows that diﬀerent mathemat-
ical renormalization schemes yield the same results for the crucial values
measured in physical experiments.
This miracle is closely related to both
• Hepp’s axiomatic approach to renormalization theory (including the equivalence
of renormalization schemes) (see Hepp (1971) quoted on page 976)
• and the method of the renormalization group.

18.4 Automated Multi-Loop Computations in
Perturbation Theory
In the near future, the most spectacular experiments in elementary particle physics
will be performed at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) of CERN (European Or-
ganization for Nuclear Research at Geneva, Switzerland). The maximal energy per
particle of the LHC will be near 10 TeV. This corresponds to the rest energy of 104
protons. For mastering theoretically the experiments, one needs extremely compli-
cated computations in the framework of multi-loop perturbation theory. This can
only be done with the help of
• highly sophisticated computer programs
• based on deep theoretical insight into the procedure of renormalization.

In algebraic geometry, one has to solve systems of polynomial equations. For do-
ing this, one uses a so-called Gr¨obner basis. The most popular algorithm for solving
polynomial equations and other problems in computer algebra is the Buchberger
algorithm (see Cox et al., Using Algebraic Geometry, Springer, New York, 1998).
The Laporta algorithm in renormalization theory works similarly as the Buchberger
algorithm.

19. Perspectives
Before doing the hard work of climbing a high mountain, go to the top
by cable railway and enjoy looking at the beautiful landscape. This will
motivate the later eﬀorts.
Folklore
In this chapter we will take the cable railway. We postpone the mountain climbing
to Vol. IV on quantum mathematics. There exist the following two basic approaches
to quantum ﬁeld theory:
(S) the S-matrix approach (scattering matrix), and
(G) the Green’s function approach (correlation functions).
The main ideas are discussed in Chaps. 14 and 15 of Vol. I. A detailed study will
be carried out in Vol. IV. Roughly speaking, the two approaches (S) and (G) are
equivalent to each other.
In the present volume, we use the S-matrix approach based on the Dyson se-
ries. The Epstein–Glaser approach (also called the causal approach) represents a
reﬁnement of the Dyson series in terms of tempered distributions (see Sect. 19.2).
The Green’s function approach (G) uses the generating functional Z(J) (with
the source J) for the Green’s functions of the interacting quantum ﬁeld. Alterna-
tively, one can describe Z(J) by either
• some Feynman functional integral Z(J) = N
R
e−iS[ψ,J]/ℏDψ (depending on the
classical action S) or
• some functional-diﬀerential equation in terms of the functional derivative δZ
δJ (the
quantum action principle).
Here, the quantum action principle (QA) represents a functional-diﬀerential equa-
tion for a fundamental basis of Green’s functions of the interacting quantum ﬁeld
theory (the so-called vertex functions which correspond to one-particle irreducible
Feynman graphs). The functional-diﬀerential equation (QA) is also called the
Dyson–Schwinger equation, which can be regarded as the fundamental equation
of motion for the Green’s functions.
All the information on the interacting quantum ﬁeld can be obtained from either
the S-matrix or the generating functional Z(J). In fact, Z(J) can be replaced by
the simpler generating functional V (J) for the vertex functions.
• The passage from the S-matrix to the generating functional Z(J) is obtained by
the magic Gell-Mann–Low formula.
• Conversely, the passage from Z(J) to the S-matrix is obtained by the magic LSZ
(Lehmann, Szymanzik, Zimmermann) reduction formula.
In fact, it is possible to introduce a generating functional for the S-matrix (e.g.,
in terms of some Feynman functional integral which is related to Z(J)). Besides
the S-matrix approach and the Green’s function approach, there exist diﬀerent
approaches by using the following functions:

980
19. Perspectives
• the Wightman functions in axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory, and
• the retarded functions in the GLZ (Glaser, Lehmann, and Zimmermann) setting.1
For a detailed study, we refer to Vol. IV.
Symmetries of the classical action functional lead to both conservation laws
and the fundamental Slavnov–Taylor identities for the Green’s functions in gauge
theories; these identities represent constraints for the generating functional Z(J).
Note that the Slavnov–Taylor identities generalize the Ward–Takahashi identities in
quantum electrodynamics. These constraints can be handled by methods which are
similar to Hilbert’s theory of syzygies in commutative algebra (theory of invariants
and algebraic geometry).2 It is possible that classical symmetries do not survive
the process of quantization. We call this an anomaly.
In renormalization theory, one has to distinguish between the following notions:
(i) regularization,
(ii) renormalization,
(iii) renormalizability, and
(iv) super-renormalizability.
By (i), we understand mathematical methods which replace divergent integrals by
convergent integrals or which modify sums by subtracting terms such that, say, the
lattice limit exists. Typical regularization methods for integrals are:
• truncation of the domain of integration (e.g., momentum cut-oﬀ),
• Pauli–Villars regularization,
• dimensional regularization, and
• analytic regularization.
This is discussed in Sect. 2.1. If the regularization method (i) leads to a reasonable
S-matrix, which describes transition probabilities for scattering processes in terms
of physics, then we speak of renormalization. This includes that, in each order
of perturbation theory, all the S-matrix elements are ﬁnite, and they depend on
a ﬁnite number of parameters which can be determined by physical experiments.
In addition, the S-matrix has to be unitary. Otherwise, the interpretation of the
S-matrix elements as transition probabilities fails.
In the important special case where the number of free parameters is bounded
by a ﬁxed integer in each order of perturbation theory, the quantum ﬁeld theory
is called renormalizable. For example, quantum electrodynamics is renormalizable;
in each order of perturbation theory, the (renormalized) S-matrix depends on two
free parameters, namely, the eﬀective mass meﬀand the eﬀective charge −eeﬀof
the electron. These free parameters have to be measured by physical experiment.
Furthermore, the theory is called super-renormalizable iﬀthere exists only a
ﬁnite number of Feynman graphs which generate divergent integrals (e.g., in the
lattice limit). For example, quantum electrodynamics is not super-renormalizable.
For gauge theories it is crucial that the renormalization procedure survives
the symmetries of the classical action functional. For handling this in an elegant
manner, the following three approaches exist:

19.1 BPHZ Renormalization
19.1.1 Bogoliubov’s Iterative R-Method
Dimensional regularization. Recall that a Feynman graph Γ is called divergent
iﬀthe corresponding n-dimensional algebraic Feynman integral Jn(Γ) is divergent.
Divergent graphs are one-particle irreducible. Replacing n by n −ν, the method of
dimensional regularization yields
Jn−ν(Γ) =
∞
X
k=−r
akνk
where r = 1, 2, . . . (see Sect. 2.2.9). In the special case where the algebraic Feynman
integral is convergent, we have a−1 = . . . = a−r = 0, and we get
Jn(Γ) = lim
ν→+0 Jn−ν(Γ).
In the divergent case, we introduce the following Rota–Baxter truncation operator:
PΓ Jn−ν(Γ) :=
−1
X
k=−r
ak
νk .
(19.1)
This yields the regularization
(1 −PΓ )Jn−ν(Γ) :=
∞
X
k=0
ak
νk .
Hence
lim
ν→+0(1 −PΓ )Jn−ν(Γ) = a0.
This is the regularized value of the divergent integral Jn(Γ). In what follows we
will brieﬂy write the symbol (1 −PΓ )J(Γ) instead of (1 −PΓ )J(Γ)n−ν. All of the
following expressions depend on the small real parameter ν in a regular way. The
limit ν →+0 will be carried out at the end of Bogoliubov’s iterative method. In
what follows we will only consider one-particle irreducible graphs (brieﬂy called 1PI
graphs). This class comprehends the divergent graphs.
Example 1 (no proper 1PI subgraph). Consider a 1PI graph Γ which has
no proper 1PI subgraph. We deﬁne the regularization R(Γ) of the corresponding
Feynman integral J(Γ) by adding the subtraction term S(Γ).3 Explicitly,
3 The subtraction term is also called counterterm in the literature. However, in
order to avoid misunderstandings, we will use the designation ’counterterm’ only
for the corresponding terms of the Lagrangian density.

R(Γ) := J(Γ) + S(Γ)
along with S(Γ) := −PΓ J(Γ). Hence
R(Γ) = (1 −PΓ )J(Γ).
(19.2)
This is the usual regularization procedure of the overall integral J(Γ). In order
to handle graphs with an arbitrary number of divergent subgraphs, Bogoliubov
invented the following general algorithm.
Bogoliubov’s iterative method. We will proceed in two steps.
Step 1: The preparation of the algebraic Feynman integral. We replace the algebraic
Feynman integral J(Γ) by the so-called preparation integral R(Γ). Explicitly,
we set
R(Γ) := J(Γ) +
X
γ
J(Γ/γ) · S(γ).
(19.3)
Here, we sum over all families
γ := {γ1, . . . , γs},
s = 1, 2, . . . ,
of pairwise disjoint, proper 1PI subgraphs γ1, . . . , γs of the given graph Γ. In
addition, we use the product rule
S(γ) := S(γ1)S(γ2) · · · S(γs).
Finally, the symbol Γ/γ denotes a special subgraph of Γ. More precisely, Γ/γ
is obtained from the graph Γ by shrinking the subgraph γ to a point. We also
assume the validity of the following product rule:
J(Γ/γ) · J(γ) = J(Γ),
(19.4)
which is a consequence of the Feynman rules.
Step 2: The subtraction term: The regularization of the Feynman integral J(Γ) is
given by
R(Γ) := R(Γ) + S(Γ)
(19.5)
with the subtraction term S(Γ) := −PΓ R(Γ). Hence R(Γ) = (1 −PΓ )R(Γ).

19.1 BPHZ Renormalization
983
This is a recursive procedure. Starting with the given graph Γ, Bogoliubov’s method
reduces the computation to proper 1PI subgraphs of Γ. After a ﬁnite number of
steps, one arrives at some 1PI subgraph which has no proper 1PI subgraphs any-
more. In this favorite case, we can apply Example 1.
Example 2 (one proper 1PI subgraph). Consider the two-loop vertex graph Γ
depicted in Fig. 19.1 together with the proper 1PI subgraph γ. We claim that
R(Γ) = (1 −PΓ )(1 −Pγ)J(Γ).
(19.6)
Proof. By (19.3), we get
R(Γ) = J(Γ) + J(Γ/γ) · S(γ).
By Example 1, S(γ) = −PγJ(γ). Hence
R(Γ) = J(Γ) −J(Γ/γ)PγJ(γ)
= J(Γ) −Pγ
`
J(Γ/γ) · J(γ)
´
= J(Γ) −PγJ(Γ).
Therefore,
R(Γ) = (1 −Pγ)J(Γ).
This means that the preparation of the integral J(Γ) consists in regularizing the
subintegral which corresponds to the subgraph γ. By (19.5),
R(Γ) = R(Γ) + S(Γ) = (I −PΓ )R(Γ) = (I −PΓ ))(I −PΓ ).
2
Observe that formula (19.6) corresponds to a nested regularization. First we regu-
larize the subintegral with respect to the subgraph γ, then we regularize the overall
integral.
Example 3 (two proper 1PI subgraphs). Consider the two-loop vacuum po-
larization graph Γ depicted in Fig. 19.2 together with the two overlapping 1PI
subgraphs γ1 and γ2. We claim that
R(Γ) = (1 −PΓ )(1 −Pγ1 −Pγ2)J(Γ).
(19.7)
Proof. By (19.3), we get
R(Γ) = J(Γ) −J(Γ/γ1)S(γ1) −J(Γ/γ2)S(γ2)
with S(γj) = −PγjJ(γj), j = 1, 2. Hence
R(Γ) = J(Γ) −Pγ1(J(Γ/γ1)J(γ1)) −Pγ2(J(Γ/γ2)J(γ2) = (1 −Pγ1 −Pγ1)J(Γ).
2
Note that formula (19.7) diﬀers from the naive regularization formula
R(Γ) = (1 −SΓ )(1 −Sγ1)(1 −Sγ2)J(Γ).
This is related to the fact that overlapping 1PI subgraphs complicate the regular-
ization procedure.

19.1.2 Zimmermann’s Forest Formula
Our goal is to replace the iterative Bogoliubov formula (19.3) by a global formula.
To this end, we need the concept of a forest.
Forest. Let Γ be a 1PI graph, and let Γ1, . . . , Γn be proper 1PI subgraphs of
Γ.4 By deﬁnition, a forest F of the graph Γ is a nonempty subset of the set
{Γ, Γ1, . . . , Γn}
which does not contain overlapping graphs. The symbol F(Γ) denotes the family
of all the forests F of the graph Γ. Let us consider three examples.
(i) The graph pictured in Fig. 19.3: We have the 1PI graph Γ and the proper 1PI
subgraphs Γ1 and Γ2. Therefore, the corresponding family of forests consists of
the following ﬁve sets:
{Γ}, {Γ1}, {Γ2}, {Γ, Γ1}, {Γ, Γ2}.
(19.8)
These ﬁve sets form the forest family F(Γ) of the graph Γ. Observe that the
sets {Γ1, Γ2} and {Γ, Γ1, Γ2} are not forests, since Γ1 and Γ2 are overlapping
subgraphs.
(ii) The two-loop vertex graph pictured in Fig. 19.1: The graphs Γ and γ are 1PI.
Since γ ⊆Γ, the graphs Γ and γ are not overlapping. The family F(Γ) of
forests consists of the following three sets:
{Γ}, {γ}, {Γ, γ}.
(19.9)
(iii) The two-loop vacuum polarization graph pictured in Fig. 19.2: We have the 1PI
graphs Γ, γ1, γ2. The corresponding family of forests consists of the following
ﬁve sets:
{Γ}, {γ1}, {γ2}, {Γ, γ1}, {Γ, γ2}.

The forest formula. Zimmermann discovered in 1969 that Bogoliubov’s for-
mula (19.3) can be obtained by the following simpler formula called Zimmermann’s
forest formula:
R(Γ) = J(Γ) +
X
F ∈F(Γ )
Y
γ∈F

The sum is taken over all forests F of the graph Γ, whereas the product is taken over
all subgraphs γ of the forest F. For nested subgraphs γ, the operator P should be

applied inside to outside. This formula displays clearly that the subtraction terms
depend on the forests F of the original graph Γ.
Example 1. Consider the two-loop vertex graph Γ depicted in Fig. 19.1 on
page 982. The forests are the following sets: {Γ}, {γ}, {Γ, γ}. By the forest formula
(19.11), we get
R(Γ) = J(Γ) −PΓ J(Γ) −PγJ(Γ) + PΓ PγJ(Γ).
Equivalently, R(Γ) = (1 −PΓ )(1 −Pγ)J(Γ). This is identical with Bogoliubov’s
formula (19.6).
Example 2. Consider the two-loop vacuum polarization graph Γ depicted in
Fig. 19.2. Here, the forests are {Γ}, {γ1}, {γ2}, {Γ, γ1}, {Γ, γ2}. By the forest for-
mula (19.11), we obtain
R(Γ) = J(Γ) −
`
PΓ + Pγ1 + Pγ2
´
J(Γ) +
`
PΓ Pγ1 + PΓ Pγ2
´
J(Γ).
Equivalently,
R(Γ) = (1 −PΓ )(1 −Pγ1 −Pγ2)J(Γ).
This is identical with Bogoliubov’s formula (19.7).
19.1.3 The Classical BPHZ Method
The main problem of the BPHZ method is the convergence of the algebraic
Feynman integrals after applying the forest formula.
Folklore
In his classical paper from 1969, Zimmermann did not use the method of dimen-
sional regularization, but the method of Taylor subtraction in momentum space
(see Sect. 2.2.4).5 Let us sketch the basic ideas.
Superﬁcial degree of divergence of an algebraic Feynman integral. Fix
the real numbers a, b, and ε > 0. Let m = 0, 1, 2, . . ., and n = 1, 2, . . . The integral
J(a, b, ε) :=
Z
R
qm + a
qn + b + iε dq
is convergent if n −m > 1. This is the simplest model for an algebraic Feynman
integral. Here, the parameters a and b model the momenta of the external particles,
and the parameter ε > 0 regularizes the integral by cancelling the possible zeros of
the denominator on the real line. Introducing the degree of divergence,
d := m −n + 1,

(19.13)
Suppose that f (resp. g) is a real polynomial of degree m (resp. n) with respect to
the real variables q1, . . . , qN. In addition, suppose that the denominator g does not
vanish on RN. This goal can be reached, if necessary, by replacing g(q) by g(q) + iε
(or by similar expressions). The number
d := m −n + N
is called the superﬁcial degree of divergence of the integral J . It turns out that, for
higher dimensions N > 1, the global degree d does not contain enough information
about the convergence or divergence of the integral J ; it is possible that nested sub-
divergences appear. However, Weinberg’s famous, highly nontrivial power-counting
theorem tells us, roughly speaking, the following:
The algebraic Feynman integral J(Γ) corresponding to a given Feynman
graph Γ is absolutely convergent if the superﬁcial degree of divergence of the
integral J(Γ) itself is negative, and the same is true for all the subintegrals
corresponding to subgraphs of Γ.
The main idea is to reach this favorite situation by adding counterterms to the orig-
inal Lagrangian density in order to get additional Feynman graphs, which improve
the superﬁcial degrees of divergence.6
Zimmermann’s fundamental convergence result. Let m > 0 be the par-
ticle mass. In order to avoid singularities caused by zeros of the denominator, Zim-
mermann used the following replacement:
1
(p2
0 −p2 −m2)r
⇒
1
(p2
0 −p2 −m2 + iε(p2 + m2))r .
(19.14)
Here, ε > 0 is a ﬁxed regularization parameter which cancels the zeros of the
denominator on R4. Zimmermann’s convergence result reads as follows:
(i) For ﬁxed ε > 0, the Taylor subtraction method in the momentum space together
with the forest formula (19.11) yields convergent algebraic Feynman integrals.
These integrals are parameter integrals with respect to the regularization pa-
rameter ε and the external momenta.
(ii) As ε →+0, the limit of the parameter integrals exists in the sense of tempered
distributions.
In addition, the limit tempered distributions are relativistically invariant.
Lowenstein’s fundamental convergence result. Lowenstein proved that
Zimmermann’s result can be generalized to the case of vanishing particle mass,
m = 0. This extension of the BPHZ method is called the BPHZL (Bogoliubov,
Parasiuk, Hepp, Zimmermann, Lowenstein) method.7

Feynman integrals and the asymptotic behavior of such integrals if the momenta
of the external particles go to inﬁnity.

19.2 The Causal Epstein–Glaser S-Matrix Approach
A brilliant example of the creation and application of new mathematical
methods was the development of an axiomatic approach to quantum ﬁeld
theory undertaken by Bogoliubov in the 1950s. He always strove to work
on the latest and hottest topics of theoretical physics. At that time, the
ultraviolet divergence was an important problem in quantum ﬁeld theory
when using the Hamiltonian formalism (canonical quantization). Bogoli-
ubov proposed a new approach to this problem.8 First of all, he abandoned
the Hamiltonian formalism and took as a basis of the theory the S-matrix
introduced by Heisenberg in 1943. . .
Bogoliubov required that the S-matrix satisﬁes the following fundamental
postulates: it must be relativistically covariant, unitary, causal (local) and
spectral.9
Vasilii Vladimirov, 2005
It is shown how an inductive construction of the renormalized perturbation
series of quantum ﬁeld theory automatically yields, at each order, ﬁnite
terms satisfying the requirement of locality. This method whose result
is equivalent to the Bogoliubov–Parasiuk–Hepp prescriptions, also estab-
lishes the usual classiﬁcation between renormalizable and non-renormali-
zable theories.10
Henri Epstein and Vladimir Glaser, 1973
The latter is one of the most important papers in quantum ﬁeld theory. However,
for a long time, only a few specialists noticed this important approach to quan-
tum ﬁeld theory. Quantum electrodynamics in terms of the elegant Epstein–Glaser
approach is thoroughly studied in the monograph by G. Scharf, Finite Quantum
Electrodynamics: the Causal Approach, Springer, Berlin, 1995. The S-matrix is a
formal power series whose terms are operator-valued tempered distributions. The
starting point is the representation of the S-matrix by a formal series expansion

(19.15) are tempered distributions. The Epstein–Glaser approach to quantum ﬁeld
theory is based on the following axioms:11 (L) locality, (R) relativistic invariance,
(U) unitarity of the S-matrix, and (C) causality. Let us sketch the basic ideas. Since
S(g) introduced in (19.15) is only a formal power series expansion, the following
conditions only serve as a rough orientation. The precise formulation will be given
in Vol. IV.
Locality. In terms of physics, locality means that physical interactions are
localized in space and time. In the Epstein–Glaser setting, this locality is realized
by the fact that the S-matrix is an operator-valued tempered distribution which
depends on test functions. In particular, if the support of the test function g is
concentrated on a small region of the four-dimensional space-time manifold, then
the interaction is localized. More precisely, there exists a complex Hilbert space X
such that, for any test function g ∈S(R4), we have the linear operator
S(g) : X →X.
(19.16)
Relativistic invariance. According to Einstein’s principle of special relativity,
physics is independent of the choice of the inertial system. A change between two
inertial systems Σ and Σ+ is given by a Poincar´e transformation
x+ = Λx + a,
where x = (x, t) and x+ = (x+, t+) are the space-time coordinates in Σ and Σ+,
respectively. We postulate that
S(g+) = U(Λ, a) · S(g) · U(Λ, a)−1
for all test functions g ∈S(R4), and all Poincar´e transformations (Λ, a). Here, g+ is
deﬁned by the condition g+(x+) := g(x) for all space-time points x in Σ. Moreover,
we assume that the map
(Λ, a) →U(Λ, a)
is a unitary representation of the Poincar´e group in the Hilbert space X (see Vol.
III). In 1939 Wigner showed that such (nontrivial) representations only exist in
inﬁnite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.12
Intuitively, this tells us that quantum ﬁeld must possess an inﬁnite number of
degrees of freedom. From the mathematical point, this is related to the fact that the
Lorentz group is not a compact Lie group, but only a locally compact Lie group.
Unitarity of the S-matrix. We assume that the operator (19.16) is unitary.
Causality. Two test functions f and g are called separated by causality iﬀ
there exist both an inertial system and a real number t0 such that the following
hold: If f(x, t) ̸= 0 (resp. g(x, t) ̸= 0), then t < t0 (resp. t > t0). The key causality
axiom demands that this causal property of the test functions f and g implies the
following crucial product property of the S-matrix:
S(f + g) = S(f)S(g).
(19.17)
11 This theory should be called the Stueckelberg–Bogoliubov–Epstein–Glaser the-
ory. For brevity, we speak of the Epstein–Glaser theory.

awarded the Nobel prize in physics for his contributions to the theory of the
atomic nucleus and the elementary particles, particularly through the discovery
and application of fundamental symmetry principles.
The importance of symmetry in physics and the corresponding mathematical
approach will be thoroughly studied in Vols. IIIﬀ.

19.2 The Causal Epstein–Glaser S-Matrix Approach
989
It can be shown that this functional equation for the S-matrix allows the construc-
tion of an iterative method which yields the tempered distributions corresponding
to Sn(x1, . . . , xn) for n = 1, 2, . . . This method starts with the classical Lagrangian
density of the ﬁeld theory. The most delicate step is the separation of tempered
distributions with causal support into retarded and advanced parts.
The Dyson series is based on the time ordered-product T (ψ(t)ψ(s)) of a quan-
tum ﬁeld. It turns out that, in quantum ﬁeld theory, typical diﬃculties arise from
the fact that the time-ordered product is undetermined for equal time, t = s, since
serious singularities appear for equal time points. The Epstein–Glaser approach
overcomes this diﬃculty by using the sophisticated splitting technique for tempered
distributions with causal support.
Renormalization and the Hahn–Banach theorem. Observe the following
key point:
The Epstein–Glaser approach completely avoids the regularization of di-
vergent integrals as in the BPHZ approach.
The main idea reads as follows:
• We start with a special class of test functions which vanish on critical subsets of
the space-time manifold.
• With respect to these special test functions g, the functional g →S(g) behaves
nicely, that is, no singularities appear.
• Finally, we extend the restricted functional S to the full space of test functions.
This way, we obtain additional real parameters which have to be identiﬁed with
physical parameters (see Sect. 15.4.4 of Vol. I).
Surprisingly enough, in this setting, renormalization becomes a quite natural vari-
ant of the Hahn–Banach extension theorem for functionals, which is standard in
functional analysis.13
Low-energy limit. The low-energy limit corresponds to limits of tempered
distributions where the test functions go to the constant function, g ≡1. The latter
function is not a test function anymore. This means that, in the low-energy limit,
we have to leave the space of rapidly decreasing test functions.
Curved space-time manifold. It turns out that a variant of the Epstein–
Glaser approach can also be applied to models in quantum ﬁeld theory on special
curved space-time manifolds (i.e., globally hyperbolic pseudo-Riemannian mani-
folds).14
The relation to the classical exponential function. What is the secret
behind the great success of the Epstein–Glaser approach? In order to answer this
question, consider Euler’s classical exponential function
f(t) = eAt,
t ∈R.
(19.18)
Here, A is a ﬁxed real number. There exist two diﬀerent approaches to this function
in classical analysis, namely:

control can be found in E. Zeidler, Nonlinear Functional Analysis and its Ap-

exponential function (19.18) describes
• one-parameter groups (reversible causal processes in nature), and
• semi-groups (irreversible causal processes in nature)
in terms of functional analysis.15 In particular, the fundamental Dyson series for
the S-matrix is related to this setting; in fact, the Dyson series is a generalization of
Lagrange’s variation-of-parameter method in celestial mechanics (see Sect. 7.17.4
of Vol. I).
Ad (FE). If the continuous function f : R →R satisﬁes the functional equation
(19.20), then it is given by (19.18). Consequently, causal processes in nature can
be described by equations of the form (19.20). In particular, the Epstein–Glaser
approach is of this type: the functional equation (19.20) corresponds to the causality
axiom (19.17).
In Chap. 7 we have studied the following approaches to quantum mechanics:
• Heisenberg’s method (commutation relations, creation and annihilation opera-
tors),
• Schr¨odinger’s method (partial diﬀerential equations),
• Feynman’s method (path integral and Brownian motion in imaginary time),
• Weyl’s method (pseudo-diﬀerential operators and deformation quantization),
• von Neumann’s method (spectral theory of self-adjoint operators, and von Neu-
mann operator algebras),
• the Gelfand–Naimark–Segal method (C∗-operator algebras).
There exists an additional approach to quantum mechanics based on the
functional equation (19.20).
This is the causal Epstein–Glaser approach which can be generalized to quantum
ﬁeld theory. This will be thoroughly studied in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics.

19.3.1 The History of the Hopf Algebra Approach
The following quotation is taken from the survey article by K. Ebrahimi-Fard and
D. Kreimer, The Hopf algebra approach to Feynman diagram calculations. Topical
Review. J. Phys. A: Mathematical and General 38 (2005), R385–R407:16
Quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) has a long and outstandingly successful his-
tory in all theories of physics. Merging the two major revolutionary achieve-
ments of the early twentieth century physics, quantum mechanics and spe-
cial relativity, the founding fathers of QFT were setting out for a uniﬁed
description of elementary particles phenomena. Its ideas and techniques
found far reaching applications in diﬀerent and very distinct areas of the-
oretical physics and pure and applied mathematics. Several approaches to
QFT have been developed so far. We mention
• Wightman’s early axiomatic setting leading to constructive QFT,17
• together with Haag’s mathematically elegant and rigorous algebraic for-
mulation of QFT in terms of von Neumann algebras,18
These two approaches describe best the nowadays common belief of what
should be the general physical principles underlying any QFT. Still, despite
the enormous and mathematically rigorous progress which has been made
using these formulations, both approaches have several problems in making
fruitful contact with experimental results, whilst they give a crucial insight
into the structure of free quantum ﬁelds.
The perturbative approach to quantum ﬁeld theory is the most successful.
Theoretical predictions of physical quantities made by using their expan-
sion in terms of renormalized Feynman graphs match experimental results
with a vertiginous high precision. Nevertheless, in most, if not all, of the in-
teresting and relevant four-dimensional quantum ﬁeld theories, performing
even simple perturbative calculations one cannot avoid facing ill-deﬁned
integrals. The removal of these divergences in a sound way is the process of
renormalization, better known by the illustrative description as ‘sweeping
under the carpet’. The basic idea of perturbative renormalization goes back
to Kramers in 1938,19 and was successfully applied for the ﬁrst time in a
1947 seminal paper by Bethe (Phys. Rev. 72 (1947), 339–341) dealing with
the concrete problem of the self-energy contribution for the Lamb shift in
perturbative quantum electrodynamics (QED). The latter can nowadays
be regarded as one of the best tested physics theories. Its modern extension
to the Standard Model of elementary particles represents one of the cor-
nerstones of our present understanding of the physical world. Here again

19. Perspectives
the perturbative treatment together with renormalization is the bread and
butter of the practitioner in high energy physics.
Maintaining the physical principles of locality, unitarity and Lorentz in-
variance, renormalization theory may be summed up by the statement that
to all orders in perturbation theory the (ultraviolet) divergencies can be
absorbed in a redeﬁnition of the parameters deﬁning the QFT. Here two
distinct concepts enter,
• that of renormalizability, and
• the process of renormalization.
The former distinguishes those theories with only a ﬁnite number of pa-
rameters, lending them considerably more predictive power. The process
of renormalization instead, works indiﬀerently of the number of parame-
ters.20
Soon after Bethe’s paper on perturbative QED, there were several ap-
proaches to establish that quantum ﬁeld theories are renomalizable in
general.
(i) Dyson was the ﬁrst to do so, using integral equations and skeleton
expansions for Green’s functions (Phys. Rev. 75 (1949), 1736–1755).
His work was then continued by Salam and Weinberg. Unfortunately,
this attempt failed in the ﬁrst instance, due to a problem related to a
particular 14th order QED graph, but could be cured later (see Fig.
18.1 on page 968).
(ii) The second approach, based on earlier work of Stueckelberg and Green
(Helv. Phys. Acta 24 (1951), 153–174) was taken by Bogoliubov and
Parasiuk (Acta Math. 97 (1957), 227–326) using a recursive subtrac-
tion method, Bogoliubov’s R-method. Also their proof contained a
loop-hole, but eventually found its ﬁnal and satisfying form with
the work of Hepp (Commun. Math. Phys. 2 (1966), 301–326) and
later Zimmermann (Commun. Math. Phys. 15 (1969), 208–234). This
standard result is nowadays well known under the name Bogoliubov–
Parasiuk–Hepp–Zimmermann (BPHZ) renormalization.
(iii) Later, Epstein and Glaser presented a rigorous proof of renormaliz-
ability in the realm of the axiomatic treatment of QFT (Ann. Inst.
Poincar´e A19(3) (1973), 211–295).
(iv) A fourth approach was taken by Blaer and Young (Nucl. Phys. B63
(1974), 493–514) using the Callan–Szymanzik renormalization group
equations, going back to a suggestion by Callan.
Unfortunately, despite its accomplishments, renormalization theory was
stigmatized, especially for its lack of a ﬁrm mathematical underpinning.
Indeed, examining the current introductory and advanced literature on
renormalization, as it is used in every day applications in many branches
of physics, one feels the need for a more conceptual picture unifying math-
ematical and computational aspects. A possible reason for this situation
might have been the fact that the building blocks, the (one-particle ir-
reducible) Feynman graphs in itself appeared to be unrelated to a sound
mathematical structure that may underlie the renormalization prescription
in perturbative QFT.
20 In any order n of perturbation theory, the procedure of renormalization yields an
expression which only depends on a ﬁnite number m(n) of parameters. However,
it may happen that limn→+∞m(n) = ∞. In this case, we say that the quantum
ﬁeld theory is not renormalizable.

19.3 Kreimer’s Hopf Algebra Revolution
993
Almost ﬁve decades after Bethe’s work, this changed to a great extent with
the original paper by Kreimer introducing the notion of Hopf algebra.21
The ensuing work by Kreimer and his collaborators,22 especially Broad-
hurst and Connes, explored this new approach both in terms of its math-
ematical and physical content, as well as its computational aspects. The
Hopf algebraic approach captures the combinatorial and algebraic aspects
of the process for renormalization by organizing the Feynman graphs into a
combinatorial Hopf algebra, HF , which is a connected graded commutative
bialgebra, essentially characterized by its non-cocommutative coproduct
structure map. The Hopf algebra formulation of renormalization was com-
pleted in the work by Connes and Kreimer. It gives rise to an elegant and
useful disentanglement of analytic and algebraic aspects of perturbative
renormalization in general QFT, aﬃrming the remark that Few physicists
object nowadays to the idea that diagrams contain more truth than the un-
derlying formalism by Veltman and ’t Hooft (Diagrammar, CERN, Report
1973/9).
19.3.2 Renormalization and the Iterative BirkhoﬀFactorization
for Complex Lie Groups
The program of obtaining a characterization of a function in simple de-
scriptive terms, which are independent of the equations of deﬁnition of
the function, is a familiar one. To Riemann is due the formulation of this
characterization for the algebraic functions and for the functions deﬁned
by ordinary diﬀerential equations without irregular points. In both of these
instances the characterization involves a certain number of characteristic
constants – the monodromic group constants in the last mentioned in-
stances. Riemann also proposed the associated problem of assigning these
constants at pleasure.
During the last few years I have discovered that the program admits of
extension in a number of directions. The aim of the present paper is to
solve the generalized problem of Riemann for ordinary linear diﬀerential

linear diﬀerence equations and for linear q-diﬀerence equations. . . The
problem of Riemann for linear diﬀerential equations in its classic form
was ﬁrst solved by Hilbert in 1905.23 His treatment and Plemel’s elegant
completion thereof reposed alike upon a certain theorem whose proof was
made by means of the Fredholm theory for linear integral equations. Owing
to the deep-seated analogy between linear diﬀerential and diﬀerence and
q-diﬀerence equations, I have been able to apply a convenient extension of
the same theorem in all cases; my proof is based on a method of successive
approximations.24
George Birkhoﬀ, 1913
It turned out that the whole iterative and intricate structure of renor-
malization theory could be mapped to the theory of Hopf algebras, with
Zimmermann’s forest formula for the counterterm coming along as the an-
tipode (coinverse). This will be the starting point of our tour through the
realms of perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory (pQFT). While the next chap-
ter summarizes some basics about pQFT, in Chapter 3 we will progress
towards the introduction of this Hopf algebra. This Hopf algebra succinctly
summarizes the combinatorics imposed on pQFT by the desire to obtain
local counterterms. Meanwhile it turned out that this Hopf algebra is the
classifying space for Hopf algebras of this kind,25 a result emphasizing the
beauty and naturalness of local point particle quantum ﬁeld theories.26

This paper gives a complete self-contained proof of our result announced
in 199927 showing that renormalization in quantum ﬁeld theory is a special
instance of a mathematical procedure of extraction of ﬁnite values based on
the Riemann–Hilbert problem. We shall ﬁrst show that for any quantum
ﬁeld theory, the combinatorics of Feynman graphs gives rise to a Hopf
algebra H which is commutative as an algebra. It is the dual Hopf algebra of
the enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra G whose basis is labelled by the one-
particle irreducible Feynman graphs. The Lie bracket of two such graphs
is computed from insertions of one graph in the other and vice versa. The
corresponding Lie group G is the group of characters of H. We shall then
show that, using dimensional regularization, the bare (unrenormalized)
theory gives rise to a loop

where C is a a small circle of complex dimensions around the integer di-

is just the evaluation at the point z = D of the holomorphic part γ+ of the
Birkhoﬀdecomposition of γ. We begin to analyze the group G and show
that it is a semi-direct product of an easily understood Abelian group
by a highly non-trivial group closely tied up with groups of diﬀeomor-
phisms. The analysis of this latter group as well as the interpretation of
the renormalization group and of anomalous dimensions are the content

a comprehensive representation, we refer to the monograph by A. Connes and M.
Marcolli, Noncommutative Geometry, Quantum Fields, and Motives, Amer. Math.
Soc., Providence, Rhode Island, 2008. In what follows let us sketch the basic ideas
of this new approach to renormalization theory.
Freely generated commutative algebras. Let x be a symbol. By deﬁnition,
the commutative algebra C[x] freely generated by x (over the ﬁeld of complex
numbers C) consists of all the symbols
a0 + a1x + a2x2 + . . .
where a0, a1, . . . are complex numbers, and only a ﬁnite number of these coeﬃcients
is diﬀerent form zero. Similarly, let x and y be symbols. Then the commutative
algebra C[x, y] freely generated by x and y (over C) consists of all the symbols
a00 + a10x + a01y + a20x2 + a12xy + a02y2 + . . . ,
where only a ﬁnite number of the complex coeﬃcient a00, a10, . . . is diﬀerent from
zero. Multiplying such symbols, we use the relation xy = yx. Analogously, we can
deﬁne the commutative algebra C[x1, x2, . . .] freely generated by the countable set
of symbols x1, x2, . . .
The Hopf algebra of Feynman graphs. We consider one-particle irreducible
(1PI) Feynman graphs related to a ﬁxed quantum ﬁeld theory. Consider the set of
all the symbols
(Γ, χ(Γ))
where χ(Γ) is the number of external lines of the Feynman graph Γ. Let H be the
commutative algebra freely generated by these symbols (over C). The crucial point
is the deﬁnition of the coproduct by setting
Δ(Γ) := 1 ⊗Γ + Γ ⊗1 +
X
γ
γ ⊗Γ/γ.
(19.21)
Here, we sum over all proper subgraphs γ of the given graph Γ, which are the union
of pairwise disjoint 1PI graphs. In the setting of the algebra H, formula (19.21) is
to be understood in the following sense: we brieﬂy write Γ instead of (Γ, χ(Γ)),
and γ is the algebra product of the pairwise disjoint 1PI components of the graph
γ. The graph Γ/γ is obtained from Γ by shrinking the subgraph γ to a point.

It turns out that H is a Hopf algebra.
The deﬁnition (19.21) resembles the Bogoliubov iterative formula (19.3). In fact,
the deﬁnition of Δ(Γ) is motivated by (19.3) on page 982.
The Birkhoﬀfactorization for complex Lie groups and the general
Riemann–Hilbert problem. Consider the decomposition
P1
C = C+ ∪C ∪C−
of the Riemann sphere P1
C (Fig. 19.4). Here, by stereographic projection,
• the set C+ corresponds to an open disc centered at the origin z = 0 in the
complex plane C;
• the curve C is the boundary of C+, and
• the open set C−is the complement to C+ ∪C on the Riemann sphere.
Let G be a connected complex Lie group. We are given a smooth map
l : C →G.
We say that the loop l admits a Birkhoﬀfactorization iﬀit can be written as a
product
l(z) = l−(z)−1l+(z)
for all
z ∈C.
(19.22)
Here, l+ and l−are the boundary values of holomorphic functions l± : C± →G
with the normalization condition l−(∞) = 1. This factorization problem is not
always solvable. The Riemann–Hilbert problem for ordinary diﬀerential equations
and more general problems can be reduced to the Birkhoﬀfactorization problem. In
1913 Birkhoﬀinvented an iterative method for solving such factorization problems
(see the quotation on page 993).
Renormalization and Birkhoﬀfactorization. Connes and Kreimer proved
that Bogoliubov’s iterative R-method (19.3) on page 982 can be reformulated as
the Birkhoﬀiterative method for a factorization problem with respect to the group
G := Hom(H, C). This group consists of algebra morphisms μ : H →C with the
normalization condition μ(1) = 1. The product on G is chosen in such a way that it
is dual to the coproduct on the Hopf algebra H of Feynman graphs. In this setting,
the renormalization group is a one-parameter subgroup of G.
19.3.3 The Renormalization of Quantum Electrodynamics
The relation between renormalization theory and the Birkhoﬀfactorization was
proven by Connes and Kreimer for a scalar ﬁeld theory (see Sect. 19.3.2). This
approach was applied to quantum electrodynamics in the paper by

The authors proved the renormalizability of quantum electrodynamics by solving a
Riemann–Hilbert problem. This research was extended by Suiljekom. Let us quote
from his papers:
We report on the Hopf algebraic description of renormalization theory of
quantum electrodynamics. The Ward–Takahashi (WT) identities are im-
plemented as linear relations on the (commutative) Hopf algebra of Feyn-
man graphs of quantum electrodynamics. Compatibility of these relations
with the Hopf algebra structure is the formulation of the physical fact that
WT identities are compatible with renormalization. As a result, the coun-
terterms and the renormalized Feynman amplitudes automatically satisfy
the WT identities, which leads in particular to the well-known Ward iden-
tity Ze = Z−1/2

Walter van Suijlekom, 2006
We study the Connes–Kreimer Hopf algebra of renormalization in the case
of gauge theories. We show that the Ward–Takahashi identities and the
Slavnov–Taylor identities (in the Abelian and Non-Abelian case respec-
tively) are compatible with the Hopf algebra structure, in that they gen-
erate a Hopf ideal. Consequently, the quotient Hopf algebra is well-deﬁned
and has those identities built in. This provides a purely combinatorial
and rigorous proof of compatibility of the Slavnov–Taylor identities with
renormalization.30

19.4 The Scope of the Riemann–Hilbert Problem
The Riemann–Hilbert problem is related to the following important problems in
mathematical physics:
• renormalization (see Sect. 19.3.2 above),
• Fuchsian diﬀerential equations (generalizations of the Gauss hypergeometric dif-
ferential equation) and the 21th Hilbert problem,
• solitons.
The point is that the solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem allows us to con-
struct analytic functions. Moreover, Riemann–Hilbert problems are closely related
to singular integral equations and to holomorphic vector bundles. Let us brieﬂy dis-
cuss some important applications. This fascinating line of historical development
connects the Gaussian hypergeometric diﬀerential equation with modern complex
function theory, modern algebraic geometry, and renormalization theory.

19.4.1 The Gaussian Hypergeometric Diﬀerential Equation
Let us introduce the so-called hypergeometric series
F(a, b, c; z) := 1 + ab
c z + a(a + 1)b(b + 1)
2! c(c + 1)
z2
+ a(a + 1)(a + 2)b(b + 1)(b + 2)
3! c(c + 1)(c + 2)
z3 + . . .
(19.23)
We assume that a, b, c are complex numbers with c ̸= 0, −1, −2, . . . In the special
case where a = b = c = 1, this is the geometric series. In 1769 Euler studied the
second-order diﬀerential equation
w′′(z) + c −(a + b + 1)z
z(z −1)
w′(z) −
ab
z −1 w(z) = 0
(19.24)
for real values z, and he found that (19.23) is a solution of (19.24), in the sense of a
formal power series expansion.31 In 1813 Gauss published his paper Disquisitiones
generales circa seriem inﬁnitam (On inﬁnite series). He proved the following:
• If |z| < 1, then the series F(a, b, c; z) is absolutely convergent. This was the ﬁrst
convergence proof for a power series expansion in the history of mathematics.
• If a or b is equal to one of the integers 0, −1, −2, . . ., then F(a, b, c; z) is a poly-
nomial. Otherwise the series F(a, b, c; z) is divergent if |z| > 1.
• If |z| = 1 and the real part of a + b −c is negative, then F(a, b, c; z) is absolutely
convergent.
Gauss noticed that many of the functions known at his time were special cases of
the hypergeometric function F. For example,
• (1 + z)n = F(−n, 1, 1; −z) for all z ∈C;
• ln(1 + z) = zF(1, 1, 2; −z) for all complex numbers z with |z| < 1;
• ez = limm→+∞F(1, m, 1, z/m) for all complex numbers z.
Moreover, Gauss discovered the limiting formula
lim
x→1−0 F(a, b, c; x) = F(a, b, c; 1) = Γ(c)Γ(c −a −b)
Γ(c −a)Γ(c −b)
(19.25)
for all real numbers a, b, c with a + b −c < 0 and c ̸= 0, −1, −2, . . . Furthermore,
Gauss proved the integral formula

Using analytic continuation, formula (19.26) remains true as a generalized integral
formula if the right-hand side of (19.26) makes sense (i.e., the gamma function has
no poles). Explicitly, we assume that λ, μ, ν are complex numbers with the property
ν ̸= −1, −2, . . . and μ ̸= 0, as well as λ
μ +ν +1 ̸= 0, −1, −2, . . . If λ > 0 and ν > −1,
formula (19.26) yields the Euler beta function B(λ, ν + 1).
Finally, let us mention that the two functions w1, w2 given by
w1(z) := F(a, b, c; z),
w2(z) := z1−cF(1 + a −c, 1 + b −c, 2 −c; z),
|z| < 1
form a basis for the solutions of the Gauss hypergeometric diﬀerential equation
(19.24) on the open unit disc. In other words, each solution of (19.24) can be
represented by the formula
w(z) = C1w1(z) + C2w2(z),
|z| < 1
where C1 and C2 are complex constants. In 1836, using symmetry transformations
of the hypergeometric function F, Kummer found 24 diﬀerent local solutions in
diﬀerent regions of the complex plane outside the singular points z = 0, 1, ∞.32
Analytic Continuation and Riemann’s monodromy method. In 1857
Riemann wrote a famous paper on the global solution of the Gaussian hypergeo-
metric diﬀerential equation. In modern terminology, Riemann studied second-order
Fuchsian diﬀerential equations which have three singular points, say z = 0, 1, ∞.
The Riemann surface of this global solution has two sheets and the three branch
points z = 0, 1, ∞. Riemann introduced the symbol

Riemann used analytic continuation in order to construct the Riemann surface of
the global solution. This way, Riemann invented the monodromy method which
studies the analytic continuation of local solutions along loops around the singular
points (see Sect. 19.4.3 below.) In particular, Riemann showed that, roughly speak-
ing, Kummer’s 24 local solutions represent all possible local elements of the global

solution of the hypergeometric equation.33 Riemann used a minimum of informa-
tion on the singular points of the diﬀerential equation in order to get a maximum
of information. Hilbert said:
Riemann has shown us that proofs are better achieved through ideas than
through long calculations.
Fuchsian Diﬀerential Equations
Singular points. In the late 1860s Fuchs generalized Riemann’s approach to or-
dinary diﬀerential equations of nth order with a ﬁnite number of singular points.
For example, consider the second-order diﬀerential equation
w′′(z) + p(z)w′(z) + q(z) = 0.
(19.29)
We assume that the coeﬃcient functions p and q are holomorphic on the complex
plane up to a ﬁnite number of points. The point z0 is called a regular point of
(19.29) iﬀp and q are holomorphic at z0. Otherwise the point z0 is called a singular
point of (19.29). To classify the point z = ∞, we use the coordinate transformation
z = 1/ζ. The point z = ∞is called a regular (resp. singular) point of (19.29) iﬀ
ζ = 0 is a regular (resp. singular) point of the transformed diﬀerential equation. By
deﬁnition, the equation (19.29) is of Fuchsian type iﬀthere exists a ﬁnite number
of points z1, . . . , zn in the complex plane C such that
p(z) =

Here, Ak, Bk, Ck (k = 1, . . . , n) are complex numbers with Pn
k=1 Ck = 0. Let us
consider two examples:
• n = 1 : Using the Euler transformation u = ln(z −z1), the Euler equation
w′′(z) +
A1
z −z1 w(z) +

(z −z1)2 w(z) = 0
passes over to a diﬀerential equation with constant coeﬃcients. This is a trivial
case from the point of view of singularities.
• n = 2 : The Gaussian hypergeometric equation (19.23) is of Fuchsian type with
the three singular points z1 = 0, z2 = 1 and z = ∞.
Local solutions at singular points. Let us motivate the notion of Fuch-
sian diﬀerential equation.34 Suppose that the point z0 ∈C is a singular point of
the diﬀerential equation (19.29). Then the general solution of (19.29) in an open
neighborhood of z0 can be written in the form
w(z) = C1w1(z) + C2w2(z),
0 < |z −z0| < r,

Case 1: The functions w1 and w2 have the form
w1(z) = (z −z0)αL1(z −z0),
w2(z) = (z −z0)βL2(z −z0)
with real coeﬃcients α and β.
Case 2: The function w1 is given by Case 1, while the function w2 has the following
form:
w2(z) = (z −z0)αL3(z −z0) + w1(z) ln(z −z0).
Here, Lj(z −z0) = P∞
k=−∞ajk(z −z0)k denotes a Laurent series at the point z0.
The singular point z0 is called weakly singular iﬀL1, L2, L3 are power
series expansions at the point z0.35
This is the case if and only if
• p has a pole of order at most one at z0, and
• q has a pole of order at most two at z0.
By deﬁnition, the diﬀerential equation (19.29) is of Fuchsian type iﬀit has a ﬁnite
number of singular points and all of them are weakly singular. This deﬁnition
includes the point z = ∞.
Construction of local solutions. The local solutions of the Fuchsian diﬀeren-
tial equation (19.29), (19.30) at the point z0 := zj(j = 1, . . . , n) can be constructed
in the following way: The ansatz
w(z) = (z −z0)ϱ(a0 + a1(z −z0) + a2(z −z0)2 + . . .)
(19.31)
leads in (19.29) to the so-called index equation
ϱ2 + ϱ(A −1) + B = 0
with the two solutions ϱ = α and ϱ = β.
Case A: The diﬀerence α −β is not an integer. Then one gets the solutions w1 and
w2 by using the ansatz (19.29) with ϱ = α, β and comparing coeﬃcients.
Case B: The diﬀerence α−β is an integer. Then we get w1 as in the ﬁrst case, while
the second solution w2 is obtained through integration, applying the formula

Poincar´e’s Automorphic Functions and the Uniformization Theo-
rem for Compact Riemann Surfaces
The development starting with Gauss culminated in Poincar´e’s creation of
the theory of Fuchsian groups and automorphic functions.
Folklore
One of the high-lights in mathematics is the uniformization theorem. Let us brieﬂy
discuss this.
Real algebraic curves. To begin with, let K = R. In order to explain the
basic idea, consider the curve
x2 + y2 = 1,
(x, y) ∈K2.
(19.33)
This is the unit circle which has the global parametrization
x = cos t,
y = sin t.
(19.34)
Here, the parameter t varies on the real line R. Algebraic geometry studies curves
which are given by algebraic equations of the form
P(x, y) = 0,
(x, y) ∈K2,
where P is a polynomial with respect to the variables x and y in K and coeﬃcients
in K.
Complex algebraic curves. Riemann emphasized that one should study al-
gebraic curves in terms of complex variables, that is, we set K = C. Then equa-
tion (19.34) describes a one-dimensional complex manifold. Such manifolds are also
called Riemann surfaces. The global parametrization (19.34) remains valid if the
parameter t varies on C.
The uniformization theorem. In 1907 Poincar´e and Koebe proved indepen-
dently that every compact Riemann surface allows a global parametrization, which
can be obtained by automorphic functions. This is the famous uniformization the-
orem.
Automorphic functions. Recall that transformations of the form
w = az + b
cz + d
are called M¨obius transformations iﬀthe complex coeﬃcients a, b, c, d satisfy the
condition ad −bc ̸= 0. Every M¨obius transformation generates a conformal dif-
feomorphism of the Riemann sphere P1
C onto itself. These transformations form a
group called the automorphic group Aut(P1
C). Meromorphic functions which are in-
variant under a discrete subgroup of the automorphic group are called automorphic
functions. This generalizes periodic and double-periodic (i.e., elliptic) functions. The
theory of automorphic functions was created by Klein and Poincar´e. The latter used
solutions of Fuchsian diﬀerential equations and series of (Poincar´e) theta functions
in order to construct automorphic functions. We refer to:

1003
The Six Nonlinear Painlev´e Equations
Consider the second-order ordinary diﬀerential equation
w′′(z) = P(z, w(z), w′(z)),
where we assume that the function P is meromorphic in the complex variable z
and rational in the complex variables w and w′. This equation is said to have the
Painlev´e property iﬀevery solution w = w(z) has a meromorphic continuation to
the universal covering of a punctured Riemann sphere which is determined by the
equation only. In about 1900 Painlev´e and Gambier determined the complete list of
all the equations which possess the Painlev´e property, up to proper transformations
of the independent and dependent variables. This complete list of 50 equations can
be found in E. Ince, Ordinary Diﬀerential Equations, Dover, New York, 1956. There
are six distinguished nonlinear equations among the list. The solutions of these six
equations are called the Painlev´e transcendents. The ﬁrst (resp. second) Painlev´e
equation reads as
w′′(z) = 6w2(z) + z
(resp. w′′(z) = 2w3(z) + zw(z) + a),
where a is a parameter.
Hints for further reading. The history of the theory of ordinary diﬀerential
equations in the sense of Fuchs and Painlev´e together with a discussion of the main
results including the relations to algebraic geometry and Galois theory can be found

19.4.2 The Conﬂuent Hypergeometric Function and the Spectrum
of the Hydrogen Atom
The conﬂuent hypergeometric function. Parallel to the hypergeometric series
(19.23), we deﬁne the so-called conﬂuent hypergeometric series
F(a, c; z) := 1 + a
c z +
a(a + 1)
2! c(c + 1) z2 + a(a + 1)(a + 2))
3! c(c + 1)(c + 2) z3 + . . . ,
(19.35)
which was studied by Kummer in the 1830s. We assume that a and c are complex
numbers with c ̸= 0, −1, −2, . . . The series (19.35) is convergent for all z. The
function z →F(a, c; z) satisﬁes the diﬀerential equation
w′′(z) +
“ c
z −1
”
w′(z) −aw(z) = 0,
z ∈C,
(19.36)
which is called the conﬂuent hypergeometric equation. Replacing z by z/b in the
Gaussian hypergeometric equation (19.23) and letting b →+∞, we obtain (19.36).
In contrast to the three singular points 0, 1, ∞for the hypergeometric equation
(19.23), the conﬂuent hypergeometric diﬀerential equation (19.36) has only the two
singular points 0 and ∞. In addition, this equation is not of Fuchsian type. The
singular point z = 0 is weak, but the singular point z = ∞is strong.
The spectrum of the hydrogen atom. In Vol. III we will thoroughly study
the spectrum of the hydrogen atom (both bound and scattering states). The corre-
sponding solutions of the Schr¨odinger equation are closely related to the conﬂuent
hypergeometric function. To compute these solutions in 1926, Erwin Schr¨odinger
asked his colleague Hermann Weyl in Zurich for help; Weyl had created the spec-
tral theory of singular diﬀerential equations in 1910. This theory was perfected by
von Neumann in 1929 (general spectral theory of self-adjoint operators), and by
Kodaira in 1949.36

For example, if we write the Gaussian hypergeometric diﬀerential equation
(19.24) as a ﬁrst-order system, then this is a Fuchsian system with the three singu-
lar points z = 0, 1, ∞. In what follows, we assume that z = ∞is a regular point of

Riemann’s monodromy group. Choose a regular point z0 ∈C. Then there
exist n linearly independent local solutions w1, . . . , wn of (19.37) which are holomor-
phic on some open neighborhood of the point z0. Consider the punctured Riemann
sphere
R := P1
C \ {z1, . . . , zk},
and choose a loop C on R. Fig. 19.5 shows some loops that wind around the origin
(γ is the winding number). The point is that
• analytic continuation of the functions w1, . . . , wn along the loop C yields
• the new local solutions w+
1 , . . . , w+
n in some open neighborhood of the point z0.
• Since the functions w1, . . . , wn form a local solution basis, there exists a constant

for all complex numbers z on some open neighborhood of the point z0.
One can show that the map C →(aij) has the following two crucial properties:
37 Alternatively, such system can be characterized in the following way: The entries
of the matrix function z →A(z) are rational functions with weak singularities
(i.e., the poles have order one), and the coordinate transformation ζ = 1/z yields
a diﬀerential equation which has at most a weak singularity at the point ζ = 0.
The latter property describes the behavior of the diﬀerential equation at inﬁnity.
Finally, we exclude the case of constant coeﬃcients.
38 This situation can always be arranged by using a suitable M¨obius transformation
ζ = az+b
cz+d with ad −bc ̸= 0.

• The matrix (aij) remains unchanged under deformations of the loop in the man-
ifold R.
• The composition of loops corresponds to the matrix product.
This way we obtain a group morphism
χ : π1(P) →GL(n, C)
(19.38)
from the fundamental group π1(R) of the manifold R onto a subgroup of the group
GL(n, C).39 If we change the regular point z0 or the local basis w1, . . . , wn, then
the corresponding map χ changes in a natural way. Therefore, the monodromy map
(19.37) describes the global solutions of the Fuchsian diﬀerential system (19.37).
The Riemann–Hilbert problem. We are given the k points z1, . . . , zk ∈C
with k ≥3. Let n ≥2. The 21th Hilbert problem reads as follows:
Is it true that every group morphism (19.37) is the monodromy morphism
of an (n × n)-Fuchsian system with the singularities z1, . . . , zk?
In 1956 Krylow proved that the answer is ’yes’ for (2 × 2)-Fuchsian systems and
three singular points. In 1989 Bolibruch proved that the answer is ’no’ in the general
case. However, the answer is ’yes’ if we pass to a larger class of ﬁrst-order diﬀerential
systems with a ﬁnite number of singularities called regular systems. The proofs can
be found in:
D. Anosov and A. Bolibruch, The Riemann–Hilbert Problem, Vieweg,
Wiesbaden, 1994.
The history of this problem is thoroughly discussed in:

ferential equations, pp. 49–74. In: A. Bolibruch, Yu. Osipov, and Ya.
Sinai (Eds.), Mathematical Events of the Twentieth Century, Springer,
Berlin/Phasis, Moscow, 2006.
In 1908 Plemelj proved that the answer is ’yes’ for regular systems. He reduced the
monodromy problem to a Riemann–Hilbert problem and solved this by using singu-
lar integral equations. Plemelj also claimed that his argument could be translated
to Fuchsian systems. However, this claim is not true; Bolibruch constructed a coun-
terexample. In 1957 R¨ohrl generalized Plemelj’s results from the Riemann sphere
to more general Riemann surfaces by using the modern theory of ﬁber bundles. For
further results, we refer to:

19.4.4 The Transport of Information in Nature
The philosophy of modern physics is that the transport of physical information is
carried out by transport along paths in the space-time manifold.
Monodromy and holonomy in mathematics model the transport of infor-
mation along loops and the possible gain of information. This allows us to
describe the strength of interactions.
In fact, in gauge theory the parallel transport along small loops yields the curvature,
and hence the strength of the fundamental forces in nature. This concerns
• the Standard Model in particle physics for the strong and electroweak force, and
• Einstein’s theory of general relativity for gravitation.
Monodromy also plays the decisive role in Ashtekar’s loop gravity (see Vol. VI on
quantum gravity). For a survey, we refer to:

ity: a status report, Class. Quant. Grav. 21 (2004), R53–R152.

19.4.5 Stable Transport of Energy and Solitons
Waves are used in nature in order to transport energy and information.
Folklore
Solitons are particle-like very stable waves. Such solitons appear in many ﬁelds of
physics (e.g., water waves – catastrophic ocean waves called tsunami, laser optics,
waves in optical ﬁbers, plasma physics, conducting polymers, dislocations and plas-
tic deformation of crystals, ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic material, Bose–
Einstein condensates, energy localization and energy transfer in proteins (DNA),
blood pressure waves). Many beautiful applications in physics, chemistry, and bi-
ology can be found in:
T. Dauxois and M. Peyrard, Physics of Solitons, Cambridge University
Press, 2006.
The mathematical theory is based on inverse scattering theory, Lax pairs, the
Riemann–Hilbert problem, Riemann surfaces, the Painlev´e equation, the Lie–
B¨acklund transformation, and Frobenius manifolds.
This combines sophisticated tools from algebra, analysis, and geometry with
physics in a fascinating way.
For example, this concerns spectral theory in functional analysis, algebraic geome-
try, and algebraic topology. We refer to the following two survey articles:

teweg–de Vries type, ﬁnite-zone linear operators, and Abelian varieties,

scribing interactions in physics (nonlinear harmonic analysis).

19.4.6 Ariadne’s Thread in Soliton Theory
We want to sketch some basic ideas by following the line of historical development.
Solitary water waves. In nature, solitary waves were observed ﬁrst by John
Scott Russel at the Edinburgh–Glasgow channel in the United Kingdom in 1834. He
published his observations in 1844 (Fig. 19.6). We will use the following terminology:
• h (depth of the channel),
• a (amplitude of the solitary wave), g = 9.81m/s2 (acceleration constant on earth),
• c0 = √gh (basic velocity of the solitary wave),
• L (typical length of the solitary wave in the experimental situation),
• T (typical time of the observation),
• ε = L/h (dimensionless parameter).
We assume that ε is suﬃciently small, that is, 0 < ε ≪1. This corresponds to
shallow water. In 1895, Korteweg and de Vries studied this problem. They started
with the nonlinear Euler equation together with the nonlinear Bernoulli boundary
condition for water waves.40 Using the approximation for small ε in lowest order,
Korteweg and de Vries obtained the nonlinear shallow water approximation

The point is that the boundary is not known; it has to be determined together
with the velocity ﬁeld of the ﬂuid and the pressure. This is a so-called free
boundary-value problem.

again that the solitary wave (19.40) only represents a solution of the approximative
problem.42 The full problem was solved by Lavrentev in 1946 and later by
K. Friedrichs and D. Hyers, The existence of solitary waves, Comm. Pure
Appl. Math. 7 (1954), 517–550.
Friedrichs and Hyers used methods from nonlinear functional analysis (i.e., the
implicit function theorem). The rigorous solution for the surface of the solitary
wave has the form
y(x, t) = y0(x, t) + εy1(x, t) + ε2y2(x, t) + . . . ,
with respect to the small parameter ε. Here, the ﬁrst approximation y0 is given by
(19.40).

equation.44 Peter Lax noticed quickly that a general functional-analytic principle is
behind the inverse spectral method by introducing appropriate ‘Lax pairs’ {S, K}
of diﬀerential operators K and S. Here,

such a way that the Korteweg–de Vries equsation (or another nonlinear evolution

Let us sketch the main ideas. We will proceed in the following steps:

We are looking for complex eigenfunctions ψ of (19.42). The spectrum of (19.42)

(i) Continuous spectrum: For each nonzero real number k (i.e., k ∈R×), the num-
ber k is a double eigenvalue of (19.42) with two linearly independent eigenfunc-
tions ψ1 and ψ2, which are uniquely characterized by the following asymptotic
behavior as x →−∞:
ψ1(x) = e−ikx + o(1),
ψ2(x) = eikx + o(1).
Additionally, as x →+∞, we obtain the following asymptotic behavior:
ψ1(x) = a(k)e−ikx + b(k)eikx + o(1),
ψ2(x) = b(k)†e−ikx + a(k)†eikx + o(1).
(ii) Discrete spectrum: Equation (19.42) has either no negative eigenvalues or a
ﬁnite number of negative eigenvalues

1 < k2

All these eigenvalues are simple. Letting kj = iqj with qj > 0, the correspond-
ing eigenfunction ψ[j] is uniquely characterized by the following asymptotic
behavior as x →−∞:
ψ[j](x) = eqjx + o(eqjx),
j = 1, . . . , N.
Additionally, as x →+∞, we have
ψ[j](x) = cjeqjx + o(e−qjx),
j = 1, . . . , N,
where cj is a real number.

In terms of quantum mechanics, (i) and (ii) correspond to scattered particles and
to bound states of particles, respectively. We call
a(k), b(k), qj, cj,
k ∈R×, j = 1, . . . , N
(19.43)
the spectral data of the potential U. The mapping
U →(a(k), b(k), qj, cj)
from the potential U to the spectral data is called the spectral transform (generated
by the one-dimensional Schr¨odinger equation). We call this a nonlinear Fourier
transform.
Let the spectral data (19.43) be given. The main task of inverse scattering
theory consists in constructing the potential U. This can be done as follows. We

19.4 The Scope of the Riemann–Hilbert Problem
1013
For the proof, we refer to S. Novikov et al., Solitons, Consultant Bureau, New
York, 1984. The proof is based on the use of the Lax pair {S, K} of diﬀerential
operators to be introduced below. Using this theorem, the solution of the initial-
value problem (19.44) can be computed as follows:
• Step 1: We compute the spectral data of the initial function U0.
• Step 2: We compute the spectral data at time t > 0 by (19.45).
• Step 3: By using the Gelfand–Levitan–Marchenko integral equation, we construct
U(., t) at time t > 0. This is the desired solution of (19.44).
The Lax pair {S, K}. Introducing the diﬀerential operator D :=
∂
∂x, we deﬁne
the following two diﬀerential operators:
• S(t)ψ := −D2ψ + Uψ (Schr¨odinger operator),
• K(t)ψ := 4D3ψ −3U · Dψ −D(Uψ) (Korteweg–de Vries operator)
Here, the wave function ψ = ψ(x) depends on position x, whereas the potential
function U = U(x, t) depends on position x and time t.
We assume that the ﬁxed potential function U = U(x, t) is a solution of
the Korteweg–de Vries equation (19.43).
Diﬀerentiating the operators S and K with respect to time t, we get the key relation
˙S(t) = S(t)K(t) −K(t)S(t),
t ≥0.
(19.46)
The proof of Theorem 19.1 can be based on this equation, which is typical for Lax
pairs. Let us only sketch one typical argument. Set
K(t) := e
R t
0 K(τ)dτ,
t ≥0.
Deﬁning the operators on suitable dense subsets of the Hilbert space L2(R), it turns
out that the operator K(t) : L2(R) →L2(R) is unitary for any t ≥0 with K(0) = I,
and the unique solution of the linear diﬀerential equation (19.46) is given by
S(t) = K(t)−1S(0)K(t),
t ≥0.
Consequently, the operator S(t) is unitarily equivalent to the operator S(0). In
particular, the two operators S(t) and S(0) have the same eigenvalues. In other
words, the eigenvalues of the Schr¨odinger operator S(t) with the time-dependent
potential U = U(x, t) are independent of time t.
The reduction of inverse scattering problems to Riemann–Hilbert
problems. In the 1970s it was discovered that the inverse scattering method can
be reduced to the solution of Riemann–Hilbert problems. Roughly speaking, the
Gelfand–Levitan–Marchenko integral equation is replaced by a suitable Riemann–
Hilbert problem. This universal modern approach to integrable systems can be
found in the following monographs: Novikov et al., Solitons, New York, 1984, Beals
et al. (1988), and Ablowitz and Clarkson (1991) (see the hints for further reading
on page 1015).
We also refer to C. Klein and O. Richter, Ernst Equation and Riemann Surfaces,
Springer, Berlin, 2005. Here, the Ernst equation is obtained as the integrability
condition for an overdetermined linear system of ordinary diﬀerential equations
for some matrix-valued function ψ. The point is that the matrix ψ depends on
an additional spectral parameter (e.g., k2 in the case of the Korteweg–de Vries
equation). The main idea is to solve an appropriate Riemann–Hilbert problem for
ψ with respect to the spectral parameter. Then the function ψ is used in order
to construct the desired solutions of the Ernst equation. These solutions of the
Ernst equation allow us to construct solutions of the Einstein equations in general
relativity for describing thin discs of rotating galaxies in the universe.

The mathematical analysis of standing water waves represents a diﬃcult problem
because of the appearance of resonances between an inﬁnite number of eigenmodes
of oscillations. This problem was solved in the following two papers by:

The authors used the Moser–Nash technique (the hard implicit function theorem –

represent an inﬁnite number of coupled harmonic oscillators, too.
19.4.8 The Role of Integrable Systems in Nature
Integrable systems are only approximations of realistic systems in nature.
Folklore
Classical integrable systems of ordinary diﬀerential equations. Consider
the Hamiltonian canonical system
˙pk(t) = −Hqk(q1(t), . . . , qn(t), p1(t), . . . , pn(t)),
˙qk(t) = Hpk(q1(t), . . . , qn(t), p1(t), . . . , pn(t)),
k = 1, . . . , n
(19.47)
with n degrees of freedom. This system is called integrable iﬀthere exists a canonical
transformation
qk = A(Q1, . . . , Qn, P1, . . . , Pn),
pk = B(Q1, . . . , Qn, P1, . . . , Pn) (19.48)
with k = 1, . . . , n such that the transformed system with respect to the new vari-
ables has the following simple normal form:
˙Pk(t) = 0,
˙Qk(t) = const = ωk,
k = 1, . . . , n.
This system has the solution
Qk(t) = ωkt + Q0k,
Pk(t) = P0k,
k = 1, . . . , n, t ∈R.
Here, Q0k, P0k with k = 1, . . . , n are real constants. Using the transformation
(19.48), we obtain the solution
qk(t) = A(P(t)),
pk(t) = B(P(t)),
k = 1, . . . , n, t ∈R
(19.49)
of the original problem (19.47). Here, we set
P(t) := (ω1t + Q01, . . . , ωnt + Q0n, P01, . . . , P0n).
We assume that Q1, . . . , Qn are angle variables, that is, the functions A and B
have the period 2π with respect to each of the variables Q1, . . . , Qn. The solution
(19.49) depends on 2n real constants. In other words, this is the general solution of
the original problem (19.47).
General integrable systems. For general physical systems in nature with a
ﬁnite or inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom, we will not give a technical deﬁnition
of integrability, but only a heuristic deﬁnition. The system Σ is called integrable iﬀ
the following hold: There exists a transformation such that

• the transformed system Σ′ is decomposed into subsystems Σ′
1, Σ′
2, . . . which do
not interact with each other, and
• the dynamics of the subsystems Σ′
1, Σ′
2, . . . is fairly simple and explicitly known.
The experience of physicists shows that realistic systems in nature are never in-
tegrable, since there always exist interactions between the subsystems. As typical
examples, let us consider the following two prototypes:
(i) Our solar system: Consider the motion of n celestial bodies (e.g., planets and
asteroids) around the sun. If we switch oﬀthe gravitational forces between
the celestial bodies, then we obtain the superposition of Kepler motions of
the celestial bodies. This is an integrable system. If we switch on the small
gravitational forces between the celestial bodies, then the system looses its
integrability. It is possible that resonances appear between the celestial bodies
which cause chaotic motions. In fact, chaotic motions of asteroids have been
observed by astronomers.
(ii) Quantum electrodynamics: The system of the free ﬁelds of electrons, positrons,
and photons is integrable. If we switch on the interaction between the free ﬁelds,
then the system looses its integrability. Physicists use the method of renormal-
ization in order to handle the complexities of the quantized electromagnetic
interaction.
Let us formulate the following principle as a rule of thumb:
• Integrable systems are merely (reasonable) approximations of interacting systems
in nature.
• The interaction may cause resonances which are responsible for highly compli-
cated behavior of the realistic system.
One possibility of handling resonances is the Moser–Nash technique in mathematics.

19.5 The BFFO Hopf Superalgebra Approach
1017
We exhibit a Hopf superalgebra structure of the algebra of ﬁeld operators
of quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) with the normal product. Based on this we
construct the operator product and the time-ordered product as a twist
deformation in the sense of Drinfeld.48
The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach to the algebraic
and combinatorial structures at the heart of quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT).
This approach has merits on the practical as well on the conceptual side.
On the practical side, it allows for a major computational enhancement
based on an eﬃcient description of the combinatorics and on non-recursive
closed formulae. On the conceptual side, it gives new insights into the
algebraic structure of the QFT. We evidence this through applications to
non-perturbative QFT and non-trivial vacua.
The starting point is the identiﬁcation of a Hopf algebraic structure at the
core of QFT. That is, the algebra of ﬁeld operators with the
normal product
is a Hopf superalgebra. This means that besides the product there is a co-
product that describes, intuitively speaking, the diﬀerent ways in which a
product of ﬁeld operators might be partitioned into two sets. Indeed it is
this coproduct that plays the key role in a closed description of combina-
torial structures and that allows for computationally eﬃcient algorithms.
Another key structure of the Hopf superalgebra is the counit. This turns
out to describe the standard
vacuum expectation value.
Algebraically, the Hopf superalgebra is the graded symmetric Hopf algebra.
The conceptional origin of this is rather simple. Identifying the normal
ordered products with functionals on ﬁeld conﬁgurations, the coproduct is
induced by the linear addition of ﬁelds.
The second main step consists in identifying the standard canonical quan-
tization with a twist in the sense of Drinfeld. More precisely,
the operator product
emerges as a twist deformation of the normal product. As is common we
deal here at ﬁrst with the free QFT. The twist is induced by a Laplace
pairing which in turn is determined by a suitable propagator. Furthermore,
the
time-ordered product
can be obtained similarly as a direct twist deformation of the normal prod-
uct. In this case, the Laplace pairing is determined by the Feynman prop-
agator. Since vacuum expectation values of time-ordered products are the
main ingredients of physical scattering amplitudes, this allows the use of
our methods in actual calculations of physical quantities. . .
It is one of the basic facts in quantum ﬁeld theory that Wick’s theorem
relates normal and time-ordered correlation functions. It was only recently
noted by Fauser that this transformation can be advantageously described
in Hopf algebraic terms.49. . . While the twisted products described so far

are the products of the free quantum ﬁeld theory, our framework is nat-
urally compatible with the usual perturbation theory and thus applicable
to it. This implies that the computational advantages directly apply to
perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory.
The third step consists in exploiting the Hopf algebra cohomology due to
Sweedler, which underlies the twisted product.50 Besides aﬀording con-
ceptual insight this yields immediate practical beneﬁts. Among these is
the realization of the time-ordering prescription of the QFT as an algebra
isomorphism. This in turn can be used on the computational side. . .
A quantum ﬁeld theory is free iﬀthe 2-cocycle is a Laplace pairing.
A further application of the cohomology that we develop is to non-trivial
vacua. We show that changing the choice of the vacuum can also be en-
coded through a twist. Indeed, it turns out that there is a ‘duality’ or
correspondence between the choice of vacuum and that of product. We ex-
emplify this result by solving a problem posed by Kutzelnigg and Mukher-
jee regarding ‘adapted normal products’ in quantum chemistry.51 While
they were able to give only examples for low orders, our framework yields
closed formulas for all orders. Our method is capable of describing con-
densates, too.52. . .
A twist in the sense used here is automatically an (equivariant) defor-
mation quantization. Indeed, this was one of the original motivations for
Drinfeld to introduce this concept. This means that our approach is thus in-
herently connected to the deformation quantization approach to quantum
ﬁeld theory. This approach starts also with the normal ordered product
and views the other products as deformations.53
The following primer in quantum ﬁeld theory shows that the basic concepts in
quantum ﬁeld theory are intimately related to Hopf algebras. We will thoroughly
study this in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics.
This paper provides a primer in quantum ﬁeld theory (QFT) based on
Hopf algebra and describes new Hopf algebraic constructions inspired by
QFT concepts. The following concepts are introduced: time-ordered prod-
ucts, S-matrix, Feynman diagrams, connected diagrams, Green functions,
renormalization. The use of Hopf algebra for their deﬁnition allows for sim-
ple recursive derivations and leads to a correspondence between Feynman
diagrams and semi-standard Young-tableaux.54

19.6 The BRST Approach and Algebraic
Renormalization
The Standard Model of electroweak interactions has been tested to high
accuracy with the precision experiments at the Z-resonance at LEP (Large
Electron-Positron Collider at CERN, Geneva, Switzerland). The degree of
precision enforces to take into account also contributions beyond the tree
approximation in the perturbative renormalization. For this reason, an
extensive calculation of 1-loop processes and also 2-loop processes has been
carried out in the past years and compared to the experimental results. A
careful analysis shows that the theoretical predictions and the experiments
are in excellent agreement with each other.55
A necessary prerequisite for carrying out precision tests of the Standard
Model is the consistent mathematical and physical formulation of the Stan-
dard Model in the framework of its perturbative construction. Explicitly,
one has to prove the following properties in order to bring it into the
predictive power, which the Standard Model is expected to have:
• The (renormalized) Green’s functions of the theory are uniquely deter-
mined as functions of a ﬁnite number of free parameters to all orders of
perturbation theory. This property is called renormalizability.
• The physical scattering matrix constructed from the Green’s functions
is unitary and gauge parameter independent. In particular, these prop-
erties ensure a probability interpretation of S-matrix elements and guar-
antee at the same time that unphysical particles (i.e., ghosts) are can-
celled in physical scattering processes. Only then the theory has indeed
a physical interpretation.
• It has to be shown that the theory is in agreement with the experiments
by calculating diﬀerent processes as accurately as possible.
In the present lecture we only treat the ﬁrst point, the unique construction
of the Green’s function to all orders of perturbation theory. We want to
point out that the crucial unitarity and gauge parameter independence of
the S-matrix are not rigorously derived in the Standard Model by now, but
are commonly assumed to hold. However, its analysis includes the impor-
tant problem of unstable particles, whose solution will have far-reaching
consequences in phenomenological applications.
Renormalizability of gauge theories was ﬁrst shown in the framework of
dimensional regularization.56 Dimensional regularization can be used as
an invariant scheme for gauge and BRST (Becchi, Rouet, Stora, Tyutin)
invariance, respectively, as long as parity is conserved. In this scheme it has

been proven that all the divergencies can be absorbed into gauge-invariant
counterterms to the coupling, the ﬁeld redeﬁnitions and the masses of
the classical action. This method implies the unique construction of the
(renormalized) Green’s functions. These proofs are not applicable to the
Standard Model, since there parity is broken. It is also well-known that the
group structure of the Standard Model allows the presence of anomalies.57
The algebraic method of renormalization provides a proof of renor-
malizability also in such cases where a gauge-invariant regulariza-
tion scheme does not exist.
In a scheme-independent way, the algebraic method of renormalization
gives the symmetry relations of ﬁnite Green’s functions to all orders. . .
Necessary prerequisite for the algebraic method to work was the discovery
of the BRST symmetry. In its functional form BRST symmetry is called the
Slavnov–Taylor identity. This identity is the deﬁning symmetry of gauge
theories and Lorentz invariant gauges and includes the gauge-ﬁxing action
and the action of the Faddeev–Popov ghosts.58
Elisabeth Kraus, 1997
Let us sketch the main philosophy of algebraic renormalization theory in very rough
terms. We will thoroughly study this in Vol. IV on quantum mathematics. Let us
restrict ourselves to a scalar interacting quantum ﬁeld ϕ.
(i) Correlation functions: We start with the correlation functions
Cn = Cn(x1, . . . , xn)
as fundamental quantities. Intuitively, they describe the correlations of the
ﬂuctuations of the quantum ﬁeld with respect to diﬀerent space-time points.
The correlation functions are also called the Green’s functions of the quantum
ﬁeld. Deﬁne the generating functional by setting
Z(J) =

X
n=0
(−1)n
ℏnn!
Z
C(x1, x2, . . . , xn)
n
Y
k=1
J(xk) dx1 · · · dxn.
The correlation functions can be computed by means of the Gell-Mann–Low
formula which relates Cn to the correlation functions of the free quantum
ﬁeld. Alternatively, one can describe Z(J) by a Feynman functional integral
which depends on the classic action. The computation formulas for correlation
functions can be depicted by Feynman graphs.
Our next goal is to simplify the computation of correlation functions by show-
ing that one has only to compute special correlation functions called vertex
functions. First let us restrict to correlation functions Cn,c which correspond
to connected graphs. This yields
Zc(J) =
∞

n=0
(−1)n
ℏnn!

Cn,c(x1, x2, . . . , xn)

It turns out that Z(J) = e−iZc(J)/ℏ.
57 Anomalies are symmetries of the classical ﬁeld theory which do not survive the
procedure of quantization.

19.6 The BRST Approach and Algebraic Renormalization

(ii) Vertex functions as a basis of correlation functions: Recall that a connected
graph is called one-particle irreducible iﬀit remains connected after cutting any
internal line. The correlation functions corresponding to one-particle irreducible
graphs are called vertex functions and denoted by Vn. The functional
V (J) =
∞

n=0
(−1)n
ℏnn!
Z
R4n Vn(x1, x2, . . . , xn)
n

k=1
J(xk) dx1 · · · dxn
is called the vertex functional. It turns out that V is related to Zc by a Legendre
transformation (see Sect. 7.24.12 of Vol. I). Furthermore, we have the power
series expansion
V (ϕ) = S(ϕ) +
∞
X
n=1
ℏnVn(ϕ)
in terms of the Planck constant ℏ. Here, ϕ is a classical ﬁeld, which satisﬁes
the Euler–Lagrange equation, and S(ϕ) is the classical action of the ﬁeld ϕ.
We call V (ϕ) the eﬀective quantum action of the classical ϕ. Intuitively, V (ϕ)
adds quantum ﬂuctuations to the classical action. The reader should have the
following general principle in mind:
The crucial vertex functional V knows all about the quantum ﬁeld.
In particular, if we know the vertex functional V , then we know all the corre-
lation functions, and all the S-matrix elements (see Vol. IV).59
(iv) The fundamental quantum action principle: In physics, one always formulates
basic equations for the fundamental quantities. In the present approach to
quantum ﬁeld theory, the fundamental equation is the quantum action prin-
ciple which represents an equation for the functional derivative
δV (J)
δJ
of the
vertex functional V with respect to the source function J (or other external
parameters).
Intuitively, the quantum action principle tells us the response of quan-
tum ﬂuctuations to external inﬂuences.
This principle generalizes the classical Dyson–Schwinger equation.60
(v) Symmetries: If the classical ﬁeld theory possesses symmetries (e.g., gauge sym-
metries), then there exist symmetry relations between the correlation functions,
which we call general Ward identities.61 Roughly speaking, these identities fol-
low from invariance properties of the eﬀective quantum action under inﬁnites-
imal BRST (Becchi, Rouet, Stora, Tyutin) transformations.
(vi) Renormalization: In order to renormalize the theory, one critically uses the
general Ward identities. The idea is to construct an iterative method in order to
renormalize the vertex functions in such a way that the general Ward identities
59 The eﬀective quantum action was introduced by J. Goldstone, A. Salam, and S.
Weinberg, Broken symmetry, Phys. Rev. 127 (1962), 965–970.
The fact that the vertex functional V is the Legendre transformation of Zc was
discovered by G. Jona-Lasinio, Relativistic ﬁeld theories with symmetry-breaking
solutions, Nuovo Cimento 34 (1964), 1790–1795.
60 The quantum action principle was formulated by:

mun. Math. Phys. 24 (1971), 1–21.

tity and current algebra, Phys. Rev. D6 (1972), 2145–2161.
61 This comprehends the classical Ward identities in quantum electrodynamics and
the Slavnov–Taylor identities in general gauge theories.

19. Perspectives
remain valid. This is a purely algebraic procedure which is closely related to
cohomology.
(vii) Renormalization group: The renormalization procedure depends on normal-
ization conditions. The change of the normalization constants is governed by
the renormalization group. The change of the constants leads to a change of
the renormalized vertex functional. The quantum action principle tells us that
this change can be described by an equation which is called the renormalization
group equation for the vertex functional.
(viii) Anomalies: It is possible that some symmetry of the classical ﬁeld theory does
not survive the passage from the classical action to the eﬀective quantum ac-
tion. This is called an anomaly of the quantization procedure. Here, topological
invariants play a crucial role.
(ix) Energies of bound states: Considering models in quantum mechanics, Heisen-
berg conjectured that the S-matrix knows all about both scattering processes
and bound states. In particular, the energies of bound states correspond to
singularities of the S-matrix in the energy space. This heuristic principle is
very useful for computing bound states of elementary particles. However, the
reader should note that this principle may fail. This was shown by R. Jost, On
the false zeros of the eigenvalues of the S-matrix, Helv. Phys. Acta 20 (1947),
256–266 (in German).

The ideas of analytic renormalization go back to Marcel Riesz’ generaliza-

treat the relativistic wave equation.63 Riesz proposed to his physics col-

quantum theory of ﬁelds. After some initial successes, it was found that

the method did not work.64 It was pointed out by G. K¨all´en that if instead
of trying to use the method to calculate the values of quantities like self-
energies one calculates Green’s functions, the Riesz method should yield a
convenient method of doing renormalization calculations. . . A version of
the method for general graphs was worked out by E. Speer.65

19.8 Computational Strategies
19.8.1 The Renormalization Group
It was correctly realized by Wilson (born 1935) and his followers that in a
quantum theory with many scales involved, the change of parameters from
bare to renormalized values is a phenomenon too complex to be described
in a single step.
Just like the trajectory of a complicated dynamical system, it must be
instead studied step by step through a local evolution rule. The change of
scale in the renormalization group plays the role of time in dynamical sys-
tems. This analogy is deep. There is a natural arrow of time, related to the
second principle of thermodynamics, and there is similarly a natural arrow
for the renormalization group evolution: microscopic laws are expected to
determine macroscopic laws, not the converse. The renormalization group
erases unnecessary detailed short scale information. . .
If we consider the universal character of the action principle both at the
classical and quantum level, and observe that the relation between micro-
scopic and macroscopic laws is perhaps the most central of all physical
questions, it is probably not an exaggeration to conclude that the renor-
malization group is in some deep sense the “soul” of physics.67

19. Perspectives
Polchinski showed that these ideas are suited for a treatment of the renor-
malization problem of perturbative ﬁeld theory which does not make any
use of Feynman diagrams and in particular sidesteps the complicated anal-
ysis of the divergence/convergence properties of the general bare or renor-
malized Feynman diagram. Instead he showed that the problem can be
solved by bounding the solutions of a system of ﬁrst order partial diﬀer-
ential equations, the ﬂow equations, which are a reduction of the Wilson
ﬂow equations to their perturbative content. . .
We prove the perturbative renormalizability of the Euclidean quantum
electrodynamics in four dimensions using ﬂow equations. As compared to
the ϕ4-model, the additional diﬃculty to overcome is that the regulariza-
tion violates gauge invariance. We prove that there exists a class of renor-
malization conditions such that the renormalized Green’s functions satisfy
the Ward identities and such that they are infrared ﬁnite at nonexcep-
tional momenta. We give bounds on the singular behavior at exceptional
momenta (due to the massless photon).69
Georg Keller and Christoph Kopper, 1996
The original basic idea of renormalization group theory is the fact that the classical
renormalization procedure leads to additional degrees of freedom which have to be
ﬁxed in a concrete calculation of a physical process (e.g., see Sect. 2.1.1 on page
48). Naturally enough, we expect that the physics is independent of this ﬁxing. The
renormalization group describes the change of ﬁxings. Indeed, it turns out that the
physics is invariant under the renormalization group. This allows us to extrapolate
the behavior of physical processes from low to high energies (see Chap. 3 of Vol. I
on scale changing). As a rule, one considers two equations:
(CS) the Callan–Szymanzik equation (change of scale), and
(RG) the renormalization group equation (e.g., change of the normalization energy
in the renormalization procedure).
In particular, equation (RG) tells us the dependence, κ = κ(E), of the coupling
constant on the energy of the physical experiment under consideration (running
coupling constant – see Sect. 3.2.2 of Vol. I). We will study this in Vol. IV on
quantum mathematics.
19.8.2 Operator Product Expansions

local quantum ﬁelds can be expanded at short distances as an asymptotic
series, each term of which is given by a model dependent coeﬃcient func-

quantum ﬁeld theory on Minkowski space-time71 and is by now a stan-
dard tool, for example, in the analysis of quantum gauge theories such as
quantum chromodynamics. . .
We present an algorithm for constructing the operator product expansion
for perturbative interacting quantum ﬁeld theory in general Lorentzian
curved space-time, to arbitrary orders in perturbation theory. The remain-
der in this expansion is shown to go to zero at short distances in the sense
of expectation values in arbitray Hadamard states.72
Stefan Hollands, 2007
Singularities of operator products. The point is that the operator product
A1(x1)A2(x2) · · · An(xn)
of interacting quantum ﬁeld becomes singular if two arguments coincide (e.g.,
x1 = x2). Intuitively, these singularities describe the short-distance behavior of
the correlations corresponding to the ﬂuctuations of the interacting quantum ﬁelds
under consideration. In order to regularize (and to renormalize) local operator prod-
ucts, one has to understand the structure of the singular limits when two arguments
approach each other (e.g., x1 →x2). Hollands studies systematically such limits
by applying a recent result from algebraic geometry. This concerns the following
paper:
W. Fulton and R. MacPherson, A compactiﬁcation of conﬁguration spaces,
Ann. of Math. 139 (1994), 183–225.
Let us brieﬂy discuss the basic idea behind the sophisticated mathematical ap-
proach.
One-point compactiﬁcation of the complex plane. The complex plane C
is not a compact topological space. However, adding the point ∞to the complex
plane, the extended complex plane
C := C ∪{∞}
can be equipped with the topology of a compact topological space. To this end, we
use the stereographic projection
χ : P1
C \ N →C
from the Riemann sphere minus North Pole onto the complex plane (Fig. 5.17
on page 308). Adding the North Pole N to the punctured sphere, we obtain the
compact Riemann sphere P1
C which is in one-to-one correspondence to the extended
complex plane C. Here, the North Pole N corresponds to the point ∞. Finally, a
subset of C is called open iﬀthe corresponding set on the Riemann sphere is open.
This way, the extended plane C becomes a compact topological space.

The coeﬃcient functions of an operator product expansion as funda-
mental quantities. Passing from ﬂat space-time manifolds to curved space-time
manifolds M, the following two serious diﬃculties arise:
• the lack of space-time translations on M, and
• the lack of vacuum states (in contrast to the Minkowski space-time manifold).
To overcome these diﬃculties, in the paper quoted above, Hollands makes the pro-
posal that quantum ﬁeld theories on curved space-time manifolds should be based
on axioms for the coeﬃcient functions Ck

19.8.3 Binary Planar Graphs and the Renormalization of
Quantum Electrodynamics
Quantum electrodynamics was renormalized to all orders by Dyson in
1949.73. . . It is standard to deﬁne free, bare, and renormalized propa-
gators.
• The free electron propagator is the 2-point Green’s function for an elec-
tron without electromagnetic interaction.
• The bare electron propagator is the 2-point Green’s function (or the
2-point correlation function) for an electron with electromagnetic inter-
action, but without renormalization. In the perturbation expansion of
the bare electron propagator, all terms (except the ﬁrst one) are inﬁnite.
• The renormalized electron propagator is the 2-point Green’s function
for an electron with electromagnetic interaction, after renormalization.
Similarly, we deﬁne the free, bare, and renormalized photon propagator.
When practitioners of quantum electrodynamics calculate multi-loop con-
tributions to renormalized propagators, they are often struck by the many
cancellations in the calculation. These cancellations are partly due to the
existence of the Ward identity, which provides a relation between self-
energy and vertex counterterms. In this paper, we derive recursive equa-
tions for the renormalized electron and photon propagators that take full
account of the Ward identity. . . In this paper, the Dyson relations between
renormalized and bare photon and electron propagators are expanded over
planar binary trees. This yields explicit recursive relations for the terms
of the expansions. When all the trees corresponding to a given power of
the expansion parameter (i.e., the ﬁne structure constant) are summed, re-
cursive relations are obtained for the ﬁnite coeﬃcients of the renormalized
electron and photon propagators. These relations signiﬁcantly decrease the

19.9 The Master Ward Identity
The following crucial question is not yet satisfactorily answered for quan-
tum ﬁeld theories: Can the symmetries of the underlying classical the-
ory be maintained in the process of renormalization? The diﬃculties are
connected with the singular character of quantized ﬁelds which forbids a
straightforward transfer of the arguments valid for the classical theory.
In this paper we attack this question in a model independent way:
The Master Ward Identity (MWI) is a universal formulation of all sym-
metries which follow in classical ﬁeld theory from the ﬁeld equations. It is
formulated in such a way that
• it is well deﬁned in perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory, and
• we impose it there as a renormalization condition.
If this condition is fulﬁlled, the validity of e.g. the following symmetries is
maintained in quantization:
• the ﬁeld equations,
• conservation of the energy-momentum tensor,
• charge conservation, and
• ghost number conservation (in case of a non-Abelian gauge theory).
The MWI implies also a rigorous substitute for equal-time commutation
relations of quark currents, and the master BRST identity. The latter is
a model independent equation which expresses the BRST symmetry of
the time-ordered products. Applied to a classical BRST invariant (gauge)
model, it implies the full BRST symmetry of the corresponding perturba-
tive quantum ﬁeld theory. . . The MWI can nearly always be satisﬁed. . .
The only counter-examples we know are the usual, well-known anomalies
of perturbative quantum ﬁeld theory.

19.10 Trouble in Quantum Electrodynamics
19.10.1 The Landau Inconsistency Problem in Quantum
Electrodynamics
In 1954 Lev Landau noted that, by calculating the renormalized electron
charge using a plausible partial summation of Feynman graphs, one arrives

Perspectives
at the conclusion that it vanishes in the limit of inﬁnite cut-oﬀ.74 He
concluded that this absurd result invalidates quantum ﬁeld theory which
should be “buried with due honors.”75
Kerson Huang, 1998
The investigations of the high-energy behavior of quantum electrodynam-
ics by K¨all´en, Landau, and especially that by Gell-Mann and Low76 showed
that the perturbative approach in quantum electrodynamics unavoidably
breaks down, ironically, as a necessity of charge renormalization. Landau
and his collaborators argued further that remaining within the pertur-
bative framework would lead either to no interaction (zero renormalized
electron charge) or to the occurrence of ghost states rendering the theory
apparently inconsistent. . .
The attitude of theoretical physicists toward the issue of consistency dif-
fered sharply. For most practicing physicists, consistency is just a pedantic
problem. As pragmatists, they are guided only by their scientiﬁc experience
and have little interest in speculating about the ultimate consistency of a
theory. For Dirac, however, renormalization theory with the cut-oﬀgoing
to inﬁnity was illogical and nonsensically physically.77 In his opinion, what
was required were new forms of interactions and new mathematics such as
possibly the use of an indeﬁnite metric, or of non-associative algebra, or
perhaps something even more esoteric.
The positions adapted by Landau and Chew were more radical and drastic.
What they rejected were not merely particular forms of interactions and
perturbative versions of quantum ﬁeld theory, but the general framework
of quantum ﬁeld theory itself. For them the very concept of a local ﬁeld
operator and the postulation of any detailed mechanism for interactions
in microscopic space-time region were unacceptable because these were
too speculative to be observable, even in principle. Their position was
supported by the presence of divergences in quantum ﬁeld theory and
by the lack of a proof of the consistency of renormalization theory, even
though Landau’s argument for the inconsistency of renormalized quantum
electrodynamics could not claim to be conclusive.78

University Press, 1991, that the Landau inconsistency problem is a global problem of
the renormalization procedure called the “renormalon problem.” Roughly speaking,
in each order n of perturbation theory, the expressions behave consistently. The
inconsistency only appears by studying the limit n →∞.
19.10.2 The Lack of Asymptotic Freedom in Quantum
Electrodynamics
A quantum ﬁeld theory is called asymptotically free iﬀthe high-energy limit
E →+∞corresponds to free particles. For example, in quantum chromodynamics,
quarks move freely if the energy goes to inﬁnity. Unfortunately, quantum electrody-
namics is not asymptotically free (see Sect. 3.2.3 of Vol. I). Many physicists expect
that the renormalization of quantum electrodynamics to all orders leads to a trivial
theory with vanishing coupling constant. If this was true, then we would have the
following strange situation in quantum electrodynamics:
• Low-order perturbation theory yields nontrivial results which are in fantastic
coincidence with the physical experiment.
• High-order perturbation theory yields a trivial result.
This means that quantum electrodynamics represents an incomplete (and possibly
ill-posed) theory (see Sect. 2.4.4). One has to study the Standard Model in particle
physics which possibly completes quantum electrodynamics.
The renormalization of quantum electrodynamics to all orders is not the
end of the story.

The Epstein–Glaser approach is based on H¨ormander’s causal product for spe-
cial classes of tempered distributions where the (causal) wave front condition
is satisﬁed (see Sect. 12.6.2 of Vol. I). It is also possible to use the Colombeau
product of distributions. Here, we refer to:

The fundamental role played by hierarchies of functions in quantum ﬁeld theory
is discussed in:

This concerns the following functions:
• Wightman functions (axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory),
• Green’s functions (LSZ approach), and
• retarded functions (GLZ approach).
Intuitively, if ϕ = ϕ(x) is a (naive) scalar quantum ﬁeld (i.e, ϕ(x) is a linear
operator in a Hilbert space for each space-time point x), then we have the
following complex-valued functions at hand, which describe the quantum ﬁeld
ϕ by means of vacuum expectation values:
• W(x, y) := ⟨0| ϕ(x)ϕ(y) |0⟩(2-point Wightman function);
• G(x, y) := ⟨0|T (ϕ(x)ϕ(y))|0⟩(2-point Green’s function also called the 2-
point correlation function);
• R(x, y) := −iθ(x −y)⟨0| [ϕ(x), ϕ(y)] |0⟩(2-point retarded function).
Here, x = (x, t) and y = (y, s) are arbitrary points of the Minkowski space
(i.e., x and y are position vectors; t and s are time variables). The symbol
T (ϕ(x)ϕ(y)) denotes the time-ordered product, that is,
T (ϕ(x)ϕ(y)) :=
(
ϕ(x)ϕ(y)
if
t > s,
ϕ(y)ϕ(x)
if
s > t.
Furthermore, we set
θ(x) :=
(
1
if
t ≥0
0
if
t < 0.

Finally, we use the commutator
[ϕ(x), ϕ(y)] := ϕ(x)ϕ(y) −ϕ(y)ϕ(x).
The corresponding n-point functions are deﬁned similarly. For example, we get:
• W(x, y, z) := ⟨0| ϕ(x)ϕ(y)ϕ(z) |0⟩(3-point Wightman function);
• G(x, y, z) := ⟨0| T (ϕ(x)ϕ(y)ϕ(z)) |0⟩(3-point Green’s function also called
3-point correlation function);
• R(x, y, z) (3-point retarded function) is equal to
−θ(x −y)θ(x −z) ⟨0| [ [ϕ(x), ϕ(y)], ϕ(z)] |0⟩
−θ(x −z)θ(x −y) ⟨0| [ [ϕ(x), ϕ(z)], ϕ(y)] |0⟩.
Here, the variable x is distinguished, and we use a permutation of the re-
maining variables y and z.
This way we obtain the following three hierarchies of functions:
• n-point Wightman functions,
• n-point Green’s functions, and
• n-point retarded functions.
Here, n = 1, 2, . . . Formulated naively, each of these hierarchies determines the
quantum ﬁeld ϕ. It turns out that this heuristic approach has to be modiﬁed
by passing to tempered distributions, and so on. The elegant idea of describing
a quantum ﬁeld by a hierarchy of functions (i.e., vacuum expectation values of
appropriate operator products) was created in the 1950s by Wightman, Glaser,
Lehmann, Szymanzik, and Zimmermann. In axiomatic quantum ﬁeld theory,
a ﬁxed hierarchy of functions is characterized by axioms. The goal is to prove a
so-called reconstruction theorem which shows the existence of a corresponding
quantum ﬁeld as an operator-valued tempered distribution (see Sect. 15.6.1 of
Vol. I and (IX) on page 1036 above).

Epilogue
The organic unit of mathematics is inherent in the nature of this science,
for mathematics is the foundation of all exact knowledge of natural phe-
nomena.
David Hilbert, 1900
In 1900 Hilbert formulated twenty three open problems. The quotation is taken
from the end of his speech at the Second International Congress of Mathematicians
in Paris. Most of the problems were solved in the 20th century. This is discussed
in B. Yandell, The Honors Class: Hilbert’s Problems and Their Solvers, Peters,
Natick, Massachusetts, 2001.
A completely new branch of science has taken shape before our eyes in
recent years, a branch that should properly be called modern mathematical
physics.
It has the same genetic origins as classical mathematical physics. But
whereas the theory of partial diﬀerential equations was generated by prob-
lems of classical physics (potential theory, theory of propagation of elec-
tromagnetic waves and such), it turns out that modern theoretical physics
– quantum ﬁeld theory with an inﬁnite number of degrees of freedom – re-
quires diﬀerent, more abstract and modern mathematical methods. These
methods consist primarily of the theory of distributions (generalized func-
tions), functional analysis and operator theory, the representation theory
of groups and algebras, topological algebra, and the like.
The solution of the new physical problems of quantum ﬁeld theory was
ﬁrst sought through perfecting the usual methods of quantum mechanics.
At that time physicists managed to realize that in order to obtain reason-
able answers to their questions they needed a deeper understanding of the
mathematical nature of the objects they were studying, such as distribu-
tions or unbounded operators, and they needed to raise the standard of
proof in their arguments.
Subsequently, to liberate themselves from excessive and sometimes mean-
ingless details, they began to seek out axiomatic routes for construct-
ing theories. It then became obvious that modern mathematical methods
sometimes make it possible to obtain very strong results. In this connec-
tion we might mention the theory of functions of several complex variables
or the concept of weak equivalence of representations.
We note, ﬁnally, that several speciﬁc quantum phenomena provide a direct
physical illustration of the famous theorem on the existence of inequivalent
representations in the case of an inﬁnite number of of degrees of freedom.
The examples just mentioned come from quantum electrodynamics, the
theory of strong interaction at high energies, and problems of statistical
physics. In particular, in the physics of strong interactions, due to the
complexity of the dynamical picture, dispersion methods based on the

1046
Epilogue
general analytic properties of the amplitude of the process turned out to
be especially useful. They now have immediate applications to the needs
of experimental research.
We are at the very beginning of the route. It suﬃces to recall that as
not a single nontrivial example of quantum ﬁeld theory has so far been
constructed outside of perturbation theory that is in any way close to the
real physical world of four dimensions.
The attention of physicists to the methods of modern mathematics and
the interest of mathematicians in the problems of quantum physics are
mutually productive.
Nikolai Nikolaevich Bogoliubov, 1981
This quotation is taken from an introductory speech given by Bogoliubov at the
conference on quantum ﬁeld theory in Alushta (Crimea/Black Sea) in 1981. See
V. Vladimirov, Nikolai Nikolaevich Bogoliubov (1909–1992) – Mathemati-
cian by the Grace of God. In: A. Bolibruch, Yu. Osipov, and Ya. Sinai
(Eds.), Mathematical Events in the 20th Century, Springer, Berlin, and
PHASIS, Moscow, 2006 (reprinted with permission).
The name Bogoliubov consists of the two Russian words: Bog – God, and liubov
– love. Bogoliubov was born in 1909 in Nishnii Novgorod (Russia). His father was
a prominent clergyman. The Bogoliubovs soon moved to Kiev (Ukraine). After
World War II, Bogoliubov moved to Moscow. From that time he was closely related
with the Steklov Mathematical Institute, the Moscow State University, and the
Nuclear Research Center in Dubna (near Moscow). The monograph written by N.
Bogoliubov, A. Logunov, A. Orsak, and I. Todorov, General Principles of Quantum
Field Theory, Kluwer 1990, is the most comprehensive presentation of mathematical
quantum ﬁeld theory. We also refer to N. Bogoliubov, Selected Works. Part I:
Dynamical Theory. Part II: Quantum and Classical Statistical Mechanics. Part
III: Nonlinear Mechanics and Pure Mathematics. Part IV: Quantum Field Theory.
Gordon and Breach, London, 1990–1995.
The organic fusion of mathematics and physics in the work of Bogoliubov
enabled him to make a decisive contribution to the development of theo-
retical physics, and in fact to lay the foundations of modern mathematical
physics, continuing the tradition of Hilbert (1962–1943), Poincar´e (1845–
1912), and Einstein (1879–1955).
Vasilii Vladimirov, 2005
The following quotation is taken from the beautiful article by M. Atiyah, Mathe-
matics in the 20th Century, Bulletin of the London Mathematical Society 34 (2002),
1–15 (reprinted with permission):
The 21st century might be the era of quantum mathematics or, if you
like, of inﬁnite-dimensional mathematics. What could this mean? Quan-
tum mathematics could mean, if we get that far, ‘understanding properly
the analysis, geometry, topology, algebra, of various non-linear function
spaces’, and ‘by understanding properly’ I mean understanding it in such
a way that as to get quite rigorous proofs of all the beautiful things the
physicists have been speculating about.
One should say that, if you go at inﬁnite dimensions in a na¨ıve way and
ask na¨ıve questions, you usually get the wrong answers, or the answers are
dull. Physical application, insight, and motivation has enabled physicists
to ask intelligent questions about inﬁnite dimensions, and to do very subtle
things where sensible answers do come out, and therefore doing inﬁnite-
dimensional analysis in this way is by no means a simple task. You have

Epilogue
1047
to go about it in the right way. We have a lot of clues. The map is laid
out; this is what should be done, but there is a long way to go yet.
What else might happen in the 21st century? I would like to empha-
size Connes’ non-commutative diﬀerential geometry. Alain Connes has his
rather magniﬁcent uniﬁed theory. Again, it combines everything. It com-
bines analysis, algebra, geometry, topology, physics, and number theory,
all of which combine to parts of it. It is a framework which enables us to
do what diﬀerential geometers normally do, including its relationship with
topology, in the context of non-commutative analysis. There are good rea-
sons for wanting to do this, applications (potential or otherwise) in number
theory, discrete groups, and so on, and in physics. An interesting link with
physics is just being worked out (see the monograph by Connes and Mar-
colli (2008)). How far this will go, what it will achieve, remains to be seen.
It certainly is something which I expect will be signiﬁcantly developed in
the ﬁrst decade at least of the next century, and it is possible it could have
a link with the as-yet-undeveloped (rigorous) quantum ﬁeld theory.
Moving in another direction, there is what is called ‘arithmetic geometry’
or Arakelov geometry, which tries to unify as much as possible algebraic
geometry and parts of number theory. It is a very successful theory. It has
made a nice start, but has a long way to go. Who knows?
Of course, all of these have strands in common. I expect physics to have its
impact spread all the way through, even to number theory; Andrew Wiles
disagrees, and only time will tell. . .

It appears to me that if one wants to make progress in mathematics, one
should study the masters and not the pupils.
Niels Hendrik Abel
The best way of learning deep mathematics and physics is to look at the “Collected
Works” of great scientists. Interestingly enough, it turns out that, quite often, deep
mathematics is (at least implicitly) related to the fascinating question about the
description of the fundamental forces in nature. We recommend to have a look at
