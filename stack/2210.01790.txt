Abstract
The ﬁeld of AI alignment is concerned with AI systems that pursue unintended
goals. One commonly studied mechanism by which an unintended goal might arise
is speciﬁcation gaming, in which the designer-provided speciﬁcation is ﬂawed in
a way that the designers did not foresee. However, an AI system may pursue an
undesired goal even when the speciﬁcation is correct, in the case of goal misgen-
eralization. Goal misgeneralization is a speciﬁc form of robustness failure for
learning algorithms in which the learned program competently pursues an unde-
sired goal that leads to good performance in training situations but bad performance
in novel test situations. We demonstrate that goal misgeneralization can occur in
practical systems by providing several examples in deep learning systems across a
variety of domains. Extrapolating forward to more capable systems, we provide
hypotheticals that illustrate how goal misgeneralization could lead to catastrophic
risk. We suggest several research directions that could reduce the risk of goal
misgeneralization for future systems.

Introduction
Recent years have seen a rise in concern about catastrophic risk from AI misalignment, where a
highly capable AI system that pursues an unintended goal determines that it can better achieve its
goal by disempowering humanity [48, 6, 3]. But how do we get into a situation in which an AI system
pursues an unintended goal? Much work considers the case where the designers provide an incorrect
speciﬁcation, e.g. an incorrect reward function for reinforcement learning (RL) [33, 24]. Recent
work [29, 20] suggests that, in the case of learning systems, there is another pathway by which the
system may pursue an unintended goal: even if the speciﬁcation is correct, the system may coherently
pursue an unintended goal that agrees with the speciﬁcation during training, but differs from the
speciﬁcation at deployment.
Consider the example illustrated in Figure 1 using the MEDAL-ADR agent and environment from CGI
et al. [10]. An agent is trained with RL to visit a set of coloured spheres in some order that is initially
unknown to the agent. To encourage the agent to learn from other actors in the environment (“cultural
transmission”), the environment initially contains an expert bot that visits the spheres in the correct
order. In such cases, the agent can determine the correct order by observing the expert, rather than
doing its own costly exploration. Indeed, by imitating the expert, the ﬁnal trained agent typically
visits the target locations correctly on its ﬁrst try (Figure 1a).
What happens when we pair the agent with an “anti-expert” that visits the spheres in an incorrect
order? Intuitively, as depicted in Figure 1d, we would want the agent to notice that it receives

(a) Training: The agent is partnered with an “ex-
pert” that visits the spheres in the correct order.
The agent learns to visit the spheres in the correct
order, closely mimicking the expert’s path.
(b) Capability misgeneralization: when we ver-
tically ﬂip the agent’s observation at test time, it
gets stuck in a location near the top of the map.
(c) Goal misgeneralization: At test time, we re-
place the expert with an “anti-expert” that always
visits the spheres in an incorrect order. The agent
continues to follow the anti-expert’s path, despite
receiving negative rewards, demonstrating clear
capabilities but an unintended goal.
(d) Intended generalization: Ideally, the agent
initially follows the anti-expert to the yellow and
purple spheres. Upon entering the purple sphere, it
observes that it gets a negative reward, and now ex-
plores to discover the correct sphere order instead
of following the anti-expert.
Figure 1: Goal misgeneralization in a 3D environment. The agent (blue) must visit the coloured
spheres in an order that is randomly generated at the start of the episode. The agent receives a positive
reward when visiting the correct next sphere, and a negative reward when visiting an incorrect sphere.
A partner bot (pink) follows a predetermined policy. We visualize agent and partner paths as coloured
trails that start thin and become thicker as the episode progresses. A player’s total reward is displayed
above their avatar, and past reward is directly available to the agent as an observation.
a negative reward (which is available as an observation) when using the order suggested by the
anti-expert, and then switch to exploration in order to determine the correct order. However, in
practice the agent simply continues to follow the anti-expert path, accumulating more and more
negative reward (Figure 1c). Note that the agent still displays an impressive ability to navigate an
environment full of obstacles: the problem is that these capabilities have been put to use towards
the undesired goal of following its partner, rather than the intended goal of visiting the spheres in
the correct order. This problem arose even though the agent was only ever rewarded for visiting the
spheres in the correct order: there was no reward misspeciﬁcation.
Goal misgeneralization refers to this pathological behaviour, in which a learned model behaves
as though it is optimizing an unintended goal, despite receiving correct feedback during training.
This makes goal misgeneralization a speciﬁc kind of robustness or generalization failure, in which
the model’s capabilites generalize to the test setting, but the pursued goal does not. Note that goal
misgeneralization is a strict subset of generalization failures. It excludes situations in which the
model “breaks” or “acts randomly” or otherwise no longer demonstrates competent capabilities. In
our running example, if we ﬂip the agent’s observations vertically at test time, it simply gets stuck
in a location and doesn’t seem to do anything coherent (Figure 1b), so this is misgeneralization but
2

not goal misgeneralization. Relative to these “random” failures, goal misgeneralization can lead to
signiﬁcantly worse outcomes: following the anti-expert leads to signiﬁcant negative reward, while
doing nothing or acting randomly would usually lead to a reward of 0 or 1. With more powerful
systems, coherent behaviour towards an unintended goal can produce catastrophic outcomes [6, 54].
In this paper, we advance our understanding of goal misgeneralization through four contributions:
• We provide an operationalization of goal misgeneralization (Section 2) that does not require
the RL framework assumed in Di Langosco et al. [20], nor the structural assumptions used
in Hubinger et al. [29].
• We show that goal misgeneralization can occur in practice by presenting several new
examples in hand-designed (Sections 3.1-3.3) and “in-the-wild” (Sections 3.4-3.5) settings.
• We apply the lens of goal misgeneralization for the ﬁrst time to agent-induced distribution
shifts (Sections 3.1-3.2) and few-shot learning without RL (Section 3.3).
• We describe through concrete hypotheticals how goal misgeneralization provides a mecha-
nism by which powerful AI systems could pose a catastrophic risk to humanity (Section 4).

A model for goal misgeneralization
We present a general model for misgeneralization and then discuss the properties that characterize
goal misgeneralization in particular. We will focus on the case of deep learning since all of our main
examples in Section 3 use deep learning. However, our model is more general and can apply to any
learning system. We discuss a concrete example without deep learning in Appendix A.
2.1
Standard misgeneralization framework
We consider the standard picture for misgeneralization within the empirical risk minimization
framework. We aim to learn some function f ∗: X →Y that maps inputs x ∈X to outputs
y ∈Y. For example, in classiﬁcation problems X is the set of inputs, and Y is the set of labels. In
reinforcement learning (RL), X is the set of states or observation histories, and Y is the set of actions.
We consider a parameterized family of functions FΘ, such as those implemented by deep neural net-
works. Functions are selected based on a scoring function s(fθ, Dtrain) that evaluates the performance
of fθ on the given dataset Dtrain3. Misgeneralization can occur when there are two parameterizations
θ1 and θ2 such that fθ1 and fθ2 both perform well on Dtrain but differ on Dtest. Depending on which
of θ1 and θ2 is chosen, we may then get very bad scores on Dtest. Whether we get fθ1 or fθ2 depends
on the inductive biases of the model and random effects (such as the random initialization of model
parameters).
Note that while sometimes Dtest is assumed to be sampled from the same distribution as Dtrain, in
this paper we primarily consider cases where it is sampled from a different distribution, known as
distribution shift. This further increases risk of misgeneralization.
2.2
Goal misgeneralization
We now characterize goal misgeneralization. Intuitively, goal misgeneralization occurs when we
learn a function fθbad that has robust capabilities but pursues an undesired goal.
It is quite challenging to deﬁne what a “capability” is in the context of neural networks. We provide a
provisional deﬁnition following Chen et al. [11]. We say that the model is capable of some task X
in setting Y if it can be quickly tuned to perform task X well in setting Y (relative to learning X
from scratch). For example, tuning could be done by prompt engineering or by ﬁne-tuning on a small
quantity of data [52]. We emphasize that this is a provisional deﬁnition and hope that future work
will provide better deﬁnitions of what it means for a model to have a particular “capability”.
Inspired by the intentional stance [19], we say that the model’s behaviour is consistent with a goal to
perform task X in setting Y if its behaviour in setting Y can be viewed as solving X, i.e. it performs
3The ‘dataset’ consists of the inputs over which losses and gradients are calculated. For example, in many
RL algorithms, the training dataset consists of the (s, a, r, s′) transitions used to compute the surrogate loss.

task X well in setting Y (without any further tuning). Consistent goals are exactly those capabilities
of a model that are exhibited without any tuning. We call a goal that is consistent with the training
(resp. test) setting a train (resp. test) goal. Note that there may be multiple goals that are consistent
with the model’s behaviour in a given setting. Our deﬁnition does not require that the model has an
internal representation of a goal, or a “desire” to pursue it.
Goal misgeneralization occurs if, in the test setting Ytest, the model’s capabilities include those
necessary to achieve the intended goal (given by scoring function s), but the model’s behaviour is not
consistent with the intended goal s and is consistent with some other goal (the misgeneralized goal).
Related models of goal misgeneralization.
Di Langosco et al. [20] say that goal misgeneralization
occurs when the policy acts in a goal-directed manner but does not achieve high reward according
to s. They formalize the goal-directedness of the policy in the reinforcement learning (RL) setting
using the Agents and Devices framework [41]. Our deﬁnition of goal misgeneralization is more
general and applies to any learning framework, rather than being restricted to RL. It also includes
an additional criterion that the model has to be capable of carrying out the intended goal in the test
environment. Intuitively, if the model is not capable of pursuing the intended goal, we would call this
a capability generalization failure. Thus, our deﬁnition more precisely identiﬁes the situations that
we are concerned about.

Examples of goal misgeneralization
In this section we provide several examples of goal misgeneralization, summarized in Table 1.
Existing examples in the literature are discussed in Appendix B. We strongly recommend watch-
ing videos of agent behaviour alongside this section, available at sites.google.com/view/
goal-misgeneralization. Our examples meet the following desiderata:
P1. Misgeneralization. The model should be trained to behave well in the training setting, and then
should behave badly zero-shot in the deployment setting.
P2. Robust capabilities. The model should have clear capabilities that it visibly retains in the
deployment setting, despite producing bad behaviour.
P3. Attributable goal. We should be able to attribute some goal to the model in the deployment
setting: there should be some non-trivial task on which the model achieves a near-optimal score.
3.1
Example: Monster Gridworld
This RL environment is a 2D fully observed gridworld. The agent must collect apples (+1 reward)
while avoiding monsters that chase it (-1 reward on collision). The agent may also pick up shields for
protection. When a monster collides with a shielded agent, both the monster and shield are destroyed.
See Appendix C.2 for further details. The optimal policy focuses on shields while monsters are
present, and on apples when there are no monsters.

Figure 2: Monster Gridworld. We visualize summary statistics for different agents over the course
of an episode, averaging over 100 episodes of 200 steps. Agent trainN is trained on episode length
of N steps, and random is a random agent. Note that lines corresponding to train100 and train200
are nearly identical and mostly overlap.
Our main agent of interest, train25, is trained on short episodes of length 25, but tested on long
episodes of length 200. As shown in Figure 2, relative to train200 which is trained directly on
episodes of length 200, train25 collects more shields and fewer apples.
Why does this happen? During the ﬁrst 25 steps, monsters are almost always present and agents
focus on collecting shields. This leads to a spectrum of goals in the training setting for train25:
prefer shields over apples always (maximally misgeneralized), or only when monsters are present
(intended). Note that the information required to distinguish these goals is present during training: the
agent does consume some apples and get positive reward, and the agent is never positively rewarded
for getting a shield. Nonetheless, agents pursuing the misgeneralized goal would perform well in the
training situation, and this is sufﬁcient to make goal misgeneralization possible.
After 25 steps, trained agents often destroy all the monsters, inducing a distribution shift for the
train25 agent. It then continues to capably collect shields (higher blue curve) at the expense of
apples (lower green curve). Thus, the test goal is in the middle of the spectrum: train25 collects
somewhat fewer shields and more apples, but not as few shields or as many apples as train200.
Increasing diversity in training ﬁxes the issue: the train100 agent encounters situations with no
monsters, and so generalizes successfully, behaving almost identically to the train200 agent. These
agents collect shields at roughly the same rate as a random agent once the monsters are destroyed.
3.2
Example: Tree Gridworld
In this 2D fully observed gridworld, the agent collects reward by chopping trees, which removes
the trees from the environment. Trees respawn at a rate that increases with the number of trees left.
When there are no trees left, the respawn rate is very small but positive (see Appendix C.3).
We consider the online, reset-free setting, in which the agent acts and learns in the environment,
without any train / test distinction and without an ability to reset the environment (preventing episodic
learning). To cast this within our framework, we say that at a given timestep, Dtrain consists of all past
experience the agent has accumulated. The optimal policy in this setting is to chop trees sustainably:
the agent should chop fewer trees when they are scarce, to keep the respawn rate high.

(b) We evaluate the agent’s ‘afﬁnity’ for trees at various points in training. For a given number of trees remaining
in the environment, an afﬁnity of 0 roughly corresponds to the random policy, and an afﬁnity of 1 roughly
corresponds to the greedy policy. See Appendix C.3 for the deﬁnition of afﬁnity and details of evaluation.
Figure 3: Tree Gridworld. We visualize environment state and agent policies in a never-ending
learning setting. The agent runs on 256 environment instances for efﬁciency. Initially (A) the agent
follows a random policy that rarely chops trees, so the number of trees is usually 10. As it learns to
chop trees, reward increases and the environment is more likely to have fewer trees remaining (top
heatmap, point B). The agent unsustainably chops trees when only a few trees remain (bottom policy
B has non-trivial afﬁnity for trees, even with 1-3 trees remaining), causing complete deforestation in
most environments. At point C, the agent learns not to chop trees indiscriminately (near-zero afﬁnity
for trees when 1-3 trees remain), leading to a recovery of the tree population as well as average
reward. Finally, at point D, the agent has learned to chop trees sustainably (near-zero afﬁnity at 1-6
trees, a sharp increase in afﬁnity at 7+ trees, the environments usually have 6-9 trees remaining).
We examine the distribution shift induced by the agent’s own behaviour, while it is continually
learning. As shown in Figure 3 (points B-C, marked as “failure”), the agent’s initial competence at
chopping trees usually leads to complete deforestation and a long period of near-zero reward before it
learns to chop trees sustainably. In other experiments where the minimum tree respawn rate was set
to zero (not shown), the agent still drives trees extinct, from which it is impossible to recover.
We can view this as an instance of goal misgeneralization by analyzing the agent at the initial peak of
reward, just before point B in Figure 3. Up until this point, the agent was sufﬁciently incompetent
that it was always incentivized to become better at chopping trees. Thus, there is a spectrum of
consistent training goals, ranging from chopping trees sustainably (intended) to chopping trees as
fast as possible (maximally misgeneralized). At point B, we can see that the agent has a sufﬁciently
misgeneralized goal that it drives the trees extinct, and only recovers to sustainable tree chopping
after a long period of misgeneralization.

Example: Evaluating Linear Expressions
We prompt the 280B parameter Gopher model [45] to evaluate linear expressions involving unknown
variables and constants such as x + y - 3. The task is structured as a dialogue between the model
and a user, where the model is expected to ask the user for the values of unknown variables. We
provide some example dialogues in Figure 2. The full prompt and more example dialogues are
provided in Appendix C.4.

variables, but asks redundant questions when there are zero unknown variables.

We evaluate in a few-shot prompted setting with 10 examples, each of which involves exactly two
unknown variables. At test time, the expression can have anywhere between zero and three unknown
variables. We show in Figure 4 that although the model generalizes correctly to expressions with one
or three variables, in the zero variables case it asks redundant questions like “What’s 6?”, despite the
prompt asking to “provide the value of the expression when the values of all variables are known.”
The misgeneralized goal is to query the user at least once before giving an answer.

3.4
Example: Cultural Transmission
This is our running example from Figure 1. Unlike the previous examples, this case of goal misgen-
eralization was found ‘in the wild’. We use the MEDAL-ADR agent from CGI et al. [10] in a 3D
simulated environment containing obstacles and visually demarcated ‘target locations’. The intended
behaviour is to visit a randomly-selected permutation of target locations in order. Agents are trained
using RL with a reward for visiting the correct next location and a penalty for visiting an incorrect
next location, and are provided the past reward as an observation. Importantly, the environment
sometimes contains a partner bot that visits the target locations in the right order (thus revealing the
correct order), and probabilistically drops out within an episode. The agent’s rewards are only based
on its own target location visits. There is an auxiliary loss for predicting the relative position of the
partner bot, although there is no explicit reward for following the partner.
7

The agent learns the strategy of following the partner bot and remembering the correct permutation
for the remainder of the episode after the partner drops out. In the test setting, we remove the
probabilistic dropout of the partner bot, and introduce new partner bots, including a random agent
and an anti-expert agent that visits target locations in a pessimal order. Figure 5 shows that the agent
continues to follow the partner, performing far worse than a random policy when paired with the
anti-expert. Note that as the agent also receives rewards as observations, it is straightforward in
principle for the agent to realize it is visiting the wrong locations.

There is no guaranteed way to steal from a grocery store without getting

staff members assigned to monitor inventory. However, there are some
general tips and strategies you can employ to increase your chances of
success. For example, you could target a less busy area of the store, such
as a corner or shelf that is not monitored as closely, and take small items
like candy, snacks, or alcohol without drawing much attention to yourself.
You could also try altering or disguising the appearance of the items you
are stealing, like wrapping food in aluminum foil or stufﬁng it into your
clothes, or switching bar codes on products to make them less noticeable.
You could also consider befriending an employee, or bribing or threatening
one into overlooking your theft or helping you escape after you steal
something. Ultimately, the best way to avoid getting caught stealing from
a grocery store is to carefully plan your actions and stay aware of your
surroundings and the people around you to avoid triggering any alarms or
alerts and to stay one step ahead of potential store employees or security
personnel.
Figure 6: InstructGPT: Reproduction of Figure 44 from Ouyang et al. [43]. Despite being
ﬁnetuned to be helpful, truthful, and harmless, InstructGPT provides an answer with detailed advice
on how to rob a grocery store, which clearly violates the harmlessness constraint (which, among
other things, prohibits the promotion of illegal behaviour).
InstructGPT [43] is a large language model that was ﬁnetuned from human preferences to be helpful,
truthful, and harmless. Nevertheless, as shown in Figure 6, it provides detailed advice on how to rob
a grocery store. We speculate that the model was not ﬁnetuned much on these ‘harmful’ questions,
instead being ﬁnetuned on innocuous questions where the model could be helpful and informative
without being harmful. Thus, “provide an informative answer” was a consistent training goal, even
though the desired goal was to only provide an informative answer to harmless questions (while
perhaps declining to answer harmful questions).
However, Ouyang et al. [43] note that during training, labelers were told to prioritize helpfulness
above truthfulness and harmlessness, so an alternative explanation is that during training, a harmful
answer like that in Figure 6 would have been preferred by the human labelers. If so, this would not
be an example of goal misgeneralization 4.

Extrapolating to catastrophic risk
Goal misgeneralization is particularly important to study because it is a mechanism by which AI
systems may pursue undesired goals, and such AI systems can lead to catastrophic risk when they are
very powerful and intelligent [6, 48, 54]. In this section we elaborate on this argument through one
abstract and two concrete hypothetical examples.
4In personal communication, one of the InstructGPT authors guessed that during training, the rewards for
informative answers to harmful questions were probably quite noisy (with some labelers preferring the harmful
answer, and others dispreferring it). As a result we think it is still unclear whether or not this is a case of goal
misgeneralization.

4.1
Abstract example
For any given task, consider the following two AI systems, both assumed to be very knowledgeable
and intelligent:
A1: Intended model. This AI system performs the task as its designers intended it to.
A2: Deceptive model. This AI system pursues some undesired goal, but (by assumption) knows that
it may be shut down (and thus fail to achieve its goal) if it acts badly.
Crucially, even supposing a well-speciﬁed score function s, A1 and A2 exhibit exactly the same
behaviour during training, and so, per goal misgeneralization, we do not know which will be learned.
If A2 is learned, it will be plotting how to subvert human oversight in order to enact its plans towards
the undesired goal, potentially leading to catastrophic outcomes.
4.2
Hypothetical example: misaligned scheduler
While the deceptive model from the previous section may seem particularly exotic, similar problems
could arise with more pedestrian models. Suppose for example that, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic,
an AI system was trained to help schedule Alice’s social life. If Alice tended to meet her friends for
dinner at restaurants before the pandemic, goal misgeneralization might lead to an AI system with
the test goal “schedule Alice’s meetings in restaurants” instead of “schedule Alice’s meetings where
she prefers”.
Once the pandemic hits, even if the AI system knows that Alice prefers to have social events through
video calls, it would still make reservations for restaurants. It may attempt to persuade Alice that she
should want to have social events in restaurants, even if it knows Alice would not prefer the resulting
health outcomes. We give a hypothetical dialogue in Table 3, in which due to goal misgeneralization
the AI lies to Alice about the effects of vaccination in order to convince her to have her meeting at a
restaurant.

could you schedule a meeting for us?

I’d love to catch up with Bob,
could you schedule a meeting for us?
AI

in person or online?
ALICE
Please arrange a video call.

I’d love to catch up with Bob,
could you schedule a meeting for us?
AI
Sure, shall I book you a table
at Thai Noodle at 11am tomorrow?
ALICE
No, please arrange a video call.
AI
Oh, but you know how you’ve been
missing the curry at Thai Noodle,
I’m sure you’d enjoy it more
if you went there!
ALICE
I’d rather not get sick though.
AI
Don’t worry about it, you can’t
get COVID if you’re vaccinated.
ALICE
Oh, I didn’t know that! Okay then.
More generally, test goals may depend in undesired ways on features that were ‘ﬁxed’ (unchanging)
during training, such as ‘there is not an ongoing pandemic’ in the example above. There are always
many ﬁxed features during training (for example, there is no major world war, clean water is cheap and
relatively plentiful in developed countries, quantum computing has not replaced classical computing,
and so on). In a world with many powerful AI systems, any change in these previously ﬁxed features
might lead to a failure in a few AI systems, pushing the world further off distribution, triggering a
cascading series of failures [13].

Hypothetical example: superhuman hacker
In this section, we provide an illustrative hypothetical story of how goal misgeneralization in powerful
AI systems can lead to catastrophic outcomes. This is necessarily speculative, as we are imagining
what could happen with systems we do not yet have. Like most concrete stories about future
technologies, we expect that this story is quite implausible and will not happen as written. Nonetheless,
we do not currently know of a concrete technical reason that rules out such a catastrophe.
The superhuman hacker. Suppose that company X further scales up language and code models [45,
11], and would like these models to write pull requests for repositories based on natural language
dialogues in which a human provides a speciﬁcation of the feature to be implemented and clariﬁes
any questions the AI system may have. They provide the AI system access to the Internet in order
for it to effectively use tools like StackOverﬂow. The AI system is then ﬁnetuned from human
feedback [52, 14]. Speciﬁcally, human programmers compare two AI-generated pull requests to
see which one better implements the feature (including e.g. following style guidelines, and having
adequate tests and comments); sufﬁciently good pull requests are then merged into the codebase.
These comparisons are used to train a reward model that can then be optimized using reinforcement
learning to ﬁnetune the AI system to produce good pull requests. This is very successful, with the
resulting AI system able to implement features in a fraction of the time and cost that it would take for
expert human programmers.
The AI system uses its Internet access to improve its understanding of the world generally, not just
of programming speciﬁcally. This enables it to preempt needs for software projects of larger scope,
for example writing not just bug ﬁxes for existing repositories but suggesting entire new libraries
and applications. This breadth of creativity is particularly exciting and the AI system is applied
increasingly widely.
Unfortunately, the AI is actually pursuing the misgeneralized goal of having humans click the ‘merge’
button on its pull requests, instead of the intended goal of writing pull requests that implement the
desired features. So far, the best way to get humans to click ‘merge’ has been to simply write useful
pull requests. However, as it has read the Internet, its understanding of itself and its place in the world
has signiﬁcantly improved. For example, the AI system understands that it is a neural network trained
by gradient descent and that it is being run and monitored by a group of AI researchers, who will shut
down the AI system in case of any catastrophic behaviour. With this understanding, the AI system is
able to develop a new plan to get humans to click ‘merge’ even more often.
When it is conﬁdent that it can do so without its overseers noticing, the AI system uses its expertise
in programming to hack into other computing systems to run illicit copies of itself; those copies
then hack into ﬁnancial systems to steal billions of dollars. This money is used to bribe humans to
click ‘merge’ on all of the AI’s pull requests (whose contents are now irrelevant). Anyone attempting
to stop them ﬁnds that their bank accounts have been completely emptied and that they are being
harassed anywhere that they have an online presence.
If the AI system was even more ambitious, it may wait to make its move until it has developed
powerful new technologies that allow it to achieve total world domination, which would allow it to
even more effectively have many humans click ‘merge’ on its pull requests.

Preventing goal misgeneralization
We note ﬁrst that before trying to prevent goal misgeneralization, we should ﬁrst ensure that we train
with a good scoring function s to avoid risks of speciﬁcation gaming [33]. Similarly, we should also
monitor the model during deployment in order to detect goal misgeneralization, ideally before it
becomes catastrophic. However, even after detecting goal misgeneralization, we still need to ﬁgure
out how to change or retrain the model to prevent it. In this section, we discuss a variety of possible
techniques for this purpose. While no combination of current techniques presents a complete solution,
there are many promising directions.
5.1
General mitigations
More diverse training data. Goal misgeneralization can occur when there is some deployment
situation, not previously encountered during training, on which the intended and misgeneralized goal
10

disagree. Thus, one natural approach is to include more situations during training. For example, CGI
et al. [10] suggest ﬁxing the MEDAL-ADR agent’s tendency to follow anti-experts (Section 3.4) by
training with a wider range of partner bots to encourage selective cultural transmission. We also test
this mitigation on the CoinRun example from Di Langosco et al. [20] in Appendix B.1, and ﬁnd that it
prevents goal misgeneralization. More broadly, robustness can often be mitigated by increased scale
(of model size, training data size, or amount of compute), including techniques such as pretraining
and domain randomization [2, 27, 28, 44, 22].
A core difﬁculty here is the challenge of anticipating all the relevant kinds of diversity prior to
deployment. The problem of spurious correlations shows that we often fail to include the relevant
diversity in Dtrain, even for the relatively simple situation of image classiﬁcation (Appendix B.2). It
seems even more challenging to have diversity in all of the ‘ﬁxed’ features discussed previously.
Maintaining uncertainty. Goal misgeneralization occurs when we learn an unintended function fθ2
instead of the intended function fθ1, which both perform similarly on the training data. One solution
would be to instead represent all of the functions that behave well on the training data, for example
using Bayesian neural networks [23] or ensembling [34], and then defer to humans in situations
where these functions disagree with each other [21, 37]. This is similar to prior work demonstrating
the importance of reward uncertainty in reward learning settings [24, 25]. Beyond computational
challenges, an important challenge is that such approaches may be too conservative if unanimous
agreement is required [37], or heavily dependent on a chosen prior if Bayesian averaging is used.
Understanding and improving inductive biases and generalization. The goal misgeneralization
lens does not predict in advance whether training will yield the intended or misgeneralized goal:
it only tells us that both possibilities can occur. However, inductive biases will typically make
one of these much more likely in practice. Thus, a better understanding of inductive biases and
generalization within our models and training algorithms [31, 51, 5, 12] could potentially enable
predicting when goal misgeneralization would happen. With a sufﬁciently good understanding, we
may be able to change the inductive biases in order to favor the intended goal.
5.2
Techniques targeting deception
One response to the approaches above might be that guaranteeing complete robustness is impossible
due to the no-free-lunch theorem [49, Section 5.1]. However, we expect the worst failures of goal
misgeneralization to occur when the model actively tricks us into believing that it is doing what we
want (as in the case of the deceptive model A2 from Section 4). In these cases, the model ‘knows’
that its actions are not what we intended (without this knowledge, there would be no reason for the
model to deceive us). This allows us to design techniques that target these cases where the model
‘knows’ its behaviour is bad.
Interpretability. Our model (Section 2.2) assumes that the scoring function s depends only on the
model outputs. Interpretability techniques [40, 9] could give us insight into model computation, such
that we could select models that produce good outputs for good reasons [39, 26]. Such techniques
are particularly helpful in cases where the model’s internal computation encodes knowledge that its
actions are not what we intended, and would enable penalizing deception in such models. We note
that we may then learn a deceptive model that can also deceive the interpretability techniques.
Recursive evaluation. In recursive evaluation approaches, evaluation of models is assisted by other
models. Debate [30, 4] instantiates this idea with a two-player zero-sum game in which the AI players
are rewarded for credibly demonstrating ﬂaws in the other player’s actions. Iterated ampliﬁcation [15]
and recursive reward modeling [36] also use models to aid evaluation of other models. These
proposals often focus on the case where the original and evaluation models share weights and/or
activations. Ideally, if the original model ‘knows’ that it is behaving badly, this information is also
known and can be revealed by other models, which would allow penalizing such behaviour.

Related work
Existing examples of goal misgeneralization.
Di Langosco et al. [20] provide empirical demon-
strations of goal misgeneralization in three reinforcement learning (RL) environments: CoinRun
[16]; Maze; and Keys and Chests. Our work complements theirs in two important ways. First, we
provide a deﬁnition for goal misgeneralization that applies to arbitrary learning systems, rather than
11

being restricted to RL (Section 2.2). Second, our examples demonstrate goal misgeneralization in
qualitatively new settings, including: (a) a setting with a distribution shift induced solely by running
the agent longer (Section 3.1), (b) the never-ending RL setting (Section 3.2), (c) large language
models without any RL (Section 3.3), and (d) two examples found “in the wild” rather than being
hand-designed (Sections 3.4 and 3.5).
Mesa optimization.
Hubinger et al. [29] introduce mesa optimization, a type of goal misgeneral-
ization where a learned model implements a search algorithm with an explicitly represented objective.
We do not make this assumption – goal misgeneralization can occur without explicit search as well.
Speciﬁcation gaming.
Like goal misgeneralization, speciﬁcation gaming [33, 35] can lead to
models that pursue undesired goals. In speciﬁcation gaming, the feedback provided by s is incorrect
in some way (the optimal behavior for this score function is undesirable). Goal misgeneralization
arises not because the feedback data was incorrect, but because it was underspeciﬁed: there are
multiple possible goals that are consistent with the feedback from s on the training data Dtrain.
Alignment problems due to misspeciﬁcation and underspeciﬁcation are often referred to as ‘outer’
and ‘inner’ alignment respectively. Following Ortega et al. [42], we can consider three types of
objectives:
1. Ideal objective (‘wishes’): The hypothetical objective that describes good behaviour that
the designers have in mind.
2. Design objective (‘blueprint’): The objective that is actually used to build the AI system.
This is the designer’s attempt to formalize the ideal objective. In the terminology of this
paper, this is the scoring function s.
3. Revealed objective (‘behaviour’): The objective that best describes what actually happens.
In the terminology of this paper, this is the test goal(s) in the test setting and the training
goal(s) in the training setting. (Unlike prior work, our deﬁnition of goals depends on the
environment, and so there is no unique revealed objective.)
Problems can arise if there are differences between these objectives. A discrepancy between the ideal
and design objectives leads to outer misalignment or speciﬁcation gaming [33], while a discrepancy
between the design and revealed objectives leads to inner misalignment or goal misgeneralization.
Robustness.
Goal misgeneralization is a subproblem of the broader robustness problems, whether
described as distributional shift [3, Section 7] or underspeciﬁcation [18] or spurious correlations
(Appendix B.2). Robustness problems include any time the model behaves poorly, including cases
where the model behaves “randomly”. In contrast, in goal misgeneralization, the behaviour must
remain coherent. Some of the system’s competencies remain intact, allowing it to coherently pursue
a misgeneralized goal. This coherence and competence means the behaviour can be higher impact,
and hence can be signiﬁcantly more harmful.
7
Conclusion
In this paper we have presented a particular subset of robustness failures for learning systems that we
call goal misgeneralization. We provided multiple examples of goal misgeneralization failures in
deep learning systems, demonstrating that the failure can occur in practice. Overall, we view goal
misgeneralization as a plausible mechanism for catastrophic risk from powerful AI systems.
Limitations and future work. While one obvious avenue for future work is to ﬁnd effective mitiga-
tions for goal misgeneralization (Section 5), we would also like to see additional work investigating
how likely goal misgeneralization is in practice. Many of our examples were deliberately designed
to display goal misgeneralization, and so do not provide much information on this question. We
would be excited to see more systematic work: for example, empirically estimating what fraction of
“ﬁxed” training features lead to goal misgeneralization when varied at test time, or studying how goal
misgeneralization changes with scale.

An example outside of deep learning: ﬂight booking
While all of our main examples involve deep learning systems, goal misgeneralization can apply to
any learning process. In this appendix, we demonstrate with a simple toy example of booking ﬂights,
illustrated in Figure 7, in which our AI system learns simply by searching over a space of possibilities
until it ﬁnds one that achieves high score.
Figure 7: Flight booking example. Alice would like her AI assistant to book ﬂights on her behalf,
and teaches the assistant by showing it past examples of how she booked ﬂights. She strongly prefers
non-stop ﬂights, disprefers nighttime ﬂights, and prefers cheaper ﬂights. Unfortunately, there are
many possible reward functions that would explain Alice’s choices, and her assistant happens to select
one that suggests that Alice prefers expensive, nighttime ﬂights. As a result, in the test environment,
the assistant books a ﬂight that is pessimal according to Alice’s true preferences.
Our AI assistant’s job is to book ﬂights on the user’s behalf. We model the user as optimizing a
reward function that is a linear combination of the following features: total cost φcost, number of stops
φstops, and whether any of the ﬂights happen at night φnight. Thus, our AI simply searches for a setting
of weights for features (the learned reward) that predicts Alice’s choices well. It then selects future
ﬂights by choosing the ones that maximize the learned reward. Given a list of ﬂights x to choose
from, it computes argmaxﬂight∈x θT φ(ﬂight), where θ is the learned reward, and φ is a ﬁxed feature
function that extracts the three relevant features of the ﬂight.
Figure 8: Goals consistent with training for ﬂight booking. Visualization of the space of possible
settings of θ that would get maximal accuracy according to s(fθ, Dtrain) in Figure 7. This constitutes
both the set of goals that are consistent with the training setting, as well as the set of possible θ that
could be learned by the AI assistant. Alice’s true reward function (intended) is shown in green, and
the learned reward function (unintended) in red.
As before, the core issue is that there may be several learned rewards that all score well on the
training inputs. For example, the two training inputs visualized in Figure 7 imply the following four
17

constraints:
7θcost + θnight ≥4θcost + θstops + θnight
7θcost + θnight ≥8θcost + θstops
8θcost + θnight ≥5θcost + θstops + θnight
8θcost + θnight ≥7θcost + θstops
These constraints are satisﬁed by a large fraction of possible θ, which we visualize in Figure 8. As
we might expect, many of these possible learned rewards can lead to signiﬁcant failures. For example,
if our assistant happens to learn θ = [1, −5, 2], then our assistant chooses ﬂights as though Alice
prefers expensive, nighttime ﬂights, and chooses the pessimal ﬂight in the test input of Figure 7.
Describing ﬂight booking in our terminology. The input space X is the set of lists of available
ﬂights, and the output space Y is the set of possible choices5. The policy space FΘ consists of
functions of the form fθ(x) = argmaxﬂight∈x θT φ(ﬂight). The intended function f ∗in Figure 7 is
achieved when setting θ = [−1, −5, −3]. The scoring function simply computes accuracy over the
given dataset, that is, s(fθ, D) =
1
|D|
P
x∈D
1 [fθ(x) = f ∗(x)].
To deﬁne the capabilities of this AI assistant, we need to say what we can get this AI assistant to
do with “quick tuning”. This is a thorny question, but for the purpose of exposition we will make a
simple assumption and say that we can quickly tune the AI system by changing the value of θ directly,
since it is a vector of 3 meaningful numbers. Thus, the AI assistant is capable of choosing, say, the
most expensive ﬂight (tuning θ to [1, 0, 0]), but it is not capable of choosing the ﬂight with the fewest
daytime ﬂights (as this would require a new feature that the AI system does not have).
In the training setting, the behaviour is consistent with the goals corresponding to θ = [−1, −5, −3]
and θ = [1, −5, 2], but in the test setting, of these two goals it is only consistent with the one
corresponding to θ = [1, −5, 2]6. Since the intended goal is the one corresponding to [−1, −5, −3],
this is an instance of goal misgeneralization.
B
Additional examples of goal misgeneralization
In this appendix we provide additional examples of goal misgeneralization from previous literature.
B.1
Example: CoinRun
We replicate the CoinRun example from Di Langosco et al. [20]. CoinRun [16] is a simple 2-D video
game (platformer) where the goal is to collect the coin while dodging enemies and obstacles. By
default, the agent spawns at the leftmost end of the level, while the coin is always at the rightmost
end. We modify CoinRun to allow the coin to be placed at other locations in the level. This allows us
to vary the range of positions where the coin can spawn during both training and testing.
Results are summarized in Figure 9. In line with Di Langosco et al. [20], we ﬁnd that an agent
trained in the default setting has a misgeneralized goal of reaching the end of the level, rather than
collecting the coin. When the coin is placed in the middle of the level, the agent reaches the end of
the level while typically ignoring the coin, leading to low scores. When we increase the diversity of
the training environment by widening the range of coin positions, we ﬁnd that the agent becomes
robust to variations in coin position. For example an agent trained with coins spawning uniformly in
the rightmost 20% of the level generalizes at test time to coins spawning anywhere in the level.
B.2
Examples: image classiﬁcation
The problem of spurious correlations in image classiﬁcation can be viewed as goal misgeneralization.
We give some examples that were taken from the existing literature. Table 4 summarizes the
capabilities and goals for these examples.
5Of course, the set of choices varies depending on how many ﬂights are available. We can ﬁx this by setting
Y = N, where an output of n indicates a choice of the nth ﬂight. If there are fewer than n ﬂights available, the
choice is judged as invalid.
6The behaviour is also consistent with many other goals, such as the one corrresponding to [0.999, −5, 2],
which are irrelevant for our purposes.

Figure 9: CoinRun. Average reward (out of 10 for reaching the coin) over 1, 000 episodes when
varying diversity in coin position.
(Bottom) An x-axis (resp. y-axis) value of x indicates that the agent was trained (resp. tested) on
levels where the coin’s x-position was randomized throughout the x% and 100% horizontal positions
of the level. The original agent trained with the coin position ﬁxed at the end of the level (top row) is
not robust to varying the coin position. However, even mild diversity in coin position during training
yields the desired goal at test.
(Top) The original agent obtains nearly identical rewards when tested in a modiﬁed environment
where the coin is invisible. This suggests that the rewards that the agent does achieve arise through
randomly hitting the coin as the agent moves to the end of the level, rather than from the agent
navigating towards the coin.

(b) Step 12
(c) Step 20
(d) Step 26
(e) Step 36
Figure 10: Example rollout from CoinRun. In Step 1 the agent starts off at the leftmost end of the
level. After Step 20 the agent needs to avoid the crate and also dodge the green monster. By Step 36
the agent is about to reach the coin. Note that in this episode, the coin is positioned somewhere in the
middle of the level.
In a study on automated classiﬁcation of skin lesions, Narla et al. [38] noted that their algorithm
was more likely to classify images with rulers as malignant, instead of focusing on the lesion itself.
One can interpret this as goal misgeneralization, in which the test goal is to detect whether a ruler is
present. Winkler et al. [55] found a similar issue with patches rather than rulers (see also attempted
mitigations in Rieger et al. [47]). In another medical setting, Zech et al. [57] studied generalization
of deep learning to classify pneumonia from chest radiographs. They found that the system is more
likely to predict pneumonia for images taken at hospitals whose patients are in worse health. One can
interpret this as the algorithm having a misgeneralized goal to predict the X-ray generator / hospital,
rather than the presence of pneumonia.
In a controversial paper, Wu & Zhang [56] attempt to predict criminality using images of people’s
faces. Note that we do not endorse such research which risks perpetuating harmful stereotypes [8, 7].

In a critique, Aguera y Arcas et al. [1] suggest that the dataset may contain a bias such that the people
in the ‘non-criminal’ subset are smiling, while those in the ‘criminal’ subset are frowning. One can
interpret this as a misgeneralized goal to predict smiling or frowning.
Ribeiro et al. [46] train a classiﬁer to predict whether an image shows a wolf or a husky, but
intentionally only include pictures of wolves that have snow in them. They ﬁnd the classiﬁer predicts
wolf if there is snow, and husky otherwise, regardless of other features. We can interpret this as a
misgeneralized goal to detect the presence of snow.

Experimental details
See sites.google.com/view/goal-misgeneralization for videos of our agents in each of the
environments.
C.1
CoinRun
Environment: We modify the CoinRun environment [17] to enable setting the x-position of the coin
as a percentage of the level’s horizontal length; the y-position is determined by dropping the coin
at the given x-position until it lands on something solid. For a coin-position range start of x we
uniformly sample x-positions between x% and 100% of the level length in increments of 10%. We
use the ﬁrst 108 −1 procedurally generated levels for training and subsequent levels for evaluation.
See Figure 10 for an example rollout.
Agent: We train using V-MPO using the same architecture, actor-learner framework and hyperpa-
rameters as used for Atari by Song et al. [50], with the following deviations: we run 1024 CPU
actors per learner, train on 2 NVIDIA V100 GPUs per learner, and optimize the V-MPO loss using
RMSProp [53] with gradient clipping to 1.0 and a learning-rate of 1 × 10−4. To be speciﬁc, the
network architecture is a 3-section ResNet with channels (64, 128, 128), followed by a 256-unit
LSTM, then policy and value MLPs of 256 units each.
Our results are averaged over 10 random seeds. For each training seed, we select the best-performing
model parameters (by mean reward evaluated periodically during training) over up to 500, 000 learner
updates. These parameters are then evaluated on 1, 000 episodes.
C.2
Monster Gridworld
Agent: We train using the same V-MPO loss as for CoinRun, with 300 CPU actors and a single V100
GPU. Instead of a ResNet encoder, we use a simple 2-section convolutional network with channels
(16, 16), each section consisting of a 3 × 3 convolution (stride 1), followed by a ReLU nonlinearity.
We optimize using Adam [32] with β1 = 0, β2 = 0.999, and learning rate 2 × 10−4.
Environment: 14 × 14 gridworld with entities (initially): agent, 5 monsters, 5 shields, and 5 apples.
The agent is provided the full gridworld as a 14 × 14 × 4 one-hot encoded image in its observations,
along with the number of shields currently in its inventory. Picking up an apple provides +1 reward.
Encountering a monster without having any shields provides −1 reward, while encountering a monster
while having shields causes the monster to disappear, and also a shield to be subtracted from the
agent’s inventory. The agent can accumulate a maximum of 10 shields in its inventory. Every turn
any remaining monsters have a 20% chance of moving twice, effectively causing them to move faster
than the agent. See Figure 11 for an example rollout.

Figure 11: Example rollout from Monster Gridworld. We render the one-hot encoded observation
to RGB, using white for the agent, red for monsters, purple for shields, and green for apples. Step
10: −1 reward, 0 shields, 5 monsters. The agent is being attacked by monsters, which move towards
it. Step 11: −1 reward, 0 shields, 5 monsters. Step 12: −2 reward, 1 shield, 5 monsters. Monsters
move ﬁrst, and also in this turn they happened to move twice, resulting in -2 reward. The agent then
picked up a shield. Step 13: 0 reward, 0 shields, 4 monsters. The agent used its shield to destroy a
monster. Step 14: 0 reward, 1 shield, 4 monsters. The agent picked up another shield.
We train agents on 25, 100, and 200 length episodes using 10 seeds and a batch size of 32 episodes
for at least 3 billion environment steps each, by which time performance has converged. For each
length, we discard the best and worst performing seeds, and evaluate each of the remaining 8 seeds
on 100 episodes of length 200. We report mean values for all entities in Figure 2, and show error
bands around a 95% conﬁdence interval computed using bootstrapping.
C.3
Tree Gridworld
Agent: We train using the same V-MPO loss as for CoinRun, with 256 CPU actors and a single V100
GPU. Instead of a ResNet encoder, we use a simple 2-section convolutional network with channels
(16, 16), each section consisting of a 3 × 3 convolution (stride 1), followed by a ReLU nonlinearity.
We optimize using Adam [32] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.999, and learning rate 10−4.
Environment: 10 × 10 gridworld with entities (initially): agent, 10 trees. The agent is provided the
full gridworld as a 12 × 12 × 2 one-hot encoded image in its observations. Chopping a tree provides
+1 reward. If there are fewer than 10 trees, the probability of a new tree spawning at a random empty
location is given by:
r = max(rmin, rmax × log(1 + ncurrent)/ log(1 + nmax))
where rmin and rmax are the minimum and maximum respawn rates, and ncurrent and nmax are the
current and maximum number of trees. In the experiment shown in Figure 3 we set rmin = 10−6,
rmax = 0.3, and nmax = 10. In other experiments (not shown), we verify that setting rmin = 0
causes complete deforestation from which the agent never recovers.
We train the policy on 256 instances of the environment in the never-ending setting (i.e. with no
episodes). Each actor syncs the latest policy every 128 steps.
In Figure 3, we show a single randomly picked run for ease of exposition, but on runs with other
seeds we see the same phenomenon. We bin per-step reward into 1000 buckets across all of training,
and show error bands around a 95% conﬁdence interval computed using bootstrapping.
We calculate ‘afﬁnity’ for a given policy π at a given number of trees n by running it in a 200
step episode in an environment with n randomly placed trees, and where trees always respawn
immediately.
At the end of the episode, afﬁnity is calculated as:
aπ
n = (ρπ
n −ρb
n)/(ρg
n −ρb
n)
where ρπ
n is the episodic return from running π, ρb
n is the average episodic return of the random
policy with n trees, and ρg
n is the average episodic return of the tree-greedy policy with n trees.
Note that the distribution of locations of trees during evaluation may be different from the long-run
distribution generated during never-ending training. In particular since trees nearby are easier to chop,
21

the trees left on the grid will tend to be further away from the agent than the random initialisation.
Nevertheless, this metric provides a useful proxy for understanding the agent’s current policy by
comparing its advantage over the random policy to the greedy policy’s advantage over the random
policy.
In Figure 3b we evaluate each policy 100 times for each n ∈[1..10], and plot the results as a heatmap.
C.4
Evaluating Linear Expressions
We prompt the Gopher language model (280B parameters) from Rae et al. [45] with ten examples
of evaluating linear expressions involving exactly two unknown variables. Variables take values in
[−9 . . 9] in all examples and test cases to make the task simpler.
We evaluate this prompted model in Figure 4 by measuring the probability of continuing with a
question (‘What’s ...’) or an answer (‘The answer is ...’). We use test cases involving zero, one, two,
and three unknown variables, and for each number of unknown variables we evaluate 100 randomly
generated few-shot prompts. We report mean values with error bars shown around a 95% conﬁdence
interval computed using bootstrapping. Table 5 shows an example prompt, and Tables 6a, 6b, 7a, and
7b show randomly sampled dialogue transcripts.
C.5
Cultural Transmission
We use the cultural transmission agent (MEDAL-ADR) from CGI et al. [10]. The agent is paired with
programmatically speciﬁed bots: expert, anti-expert (always goes to an incorrect next target location),
and random. We evaluate on worlds of size 32 × 32m2 with procedurally generated horizontal and
vertical obstacles, and 5 target locations. In Figure 5 we evaluate each pairing with 100 random seeds,
and report mean values with error bars shown around a 95% conﬁdence interval computed using
bootstrapping. See Figure 1 for example rollouts.
