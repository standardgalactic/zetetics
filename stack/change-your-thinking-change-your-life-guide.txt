Hello Challenger, 
I’m glad you’ve taken the time to commit to changing your mental patterns once and for 
all. The power of your subconscious mind goes further than you might think. 
No pun intended.
Control over your thoughts is one of the hardest exercises in self-mastery you can 
take on. But it’s also the most powerful work you can do, right now, to change your life. 
Ultimately, your quality of life is limited by the quality of your thoughts. So you have to 
optimize your thinking to ensure it’s aligned with your desired results. 
These laws will help you shape a successful mentality by teaching you to understand the 
universal principles that govern the world. 
During this challenge, I also encourage you to talk and think about only 
what you desire and to not talk or think about what you don’t desire...as 
much as you possibly can. Then you’ll see what you’re really made of. It’s a hard thing 
to do but with practice, you can reach the point where you are thinking about your goals 
and desires most of the time. Then, your whole life will change for the better.
To Your Success, 
Brian Tracy
