In this case study, we explore the capabilities and limitations of ChatGPT, a natural language
processing model developed by OpenAI. We ﬁnd that it is eﬀective at paraphrasing and explaining
concepts in a variety of styles, but not at genuinely connecting concepts. It will provide false
information with full conﬁdence and make up statements when necessary. However, its ingenious use
of language can be fruitful for identifying analogies and describing visual representations of abstract
concepts.

INTRODUCTION
ChatGPT1 is a chatbot by OpenAI launched on 30
November [1]. Five days later, it had over 1 million users
[2]. It has since gained a lot of traction—social media
is ﬂooded with excerpts of conversations with ChatGPT
that are often surprisingly human-like, funny, and insight-
ful. Some scholars are concerned that the end of essays
as a meaningful assessment tool might be near [3, 4],
since ChatGPT can easily generate convincing essays, para-
graphs, or chapters for any given topic. In this letter,
we explore how well it copes with questions regarding
the rather niche topic of string theoretical swampland
conjectures. Swampland conjectures are an intriguing
application of ChatGPT, because they synthesise diﬀerent
branches of theoretical physics: general relativity and
quantum ﬁeld theory in the framework of sting theory,
applied to cosmology. Despite the fact that they contain
a heavy mathematical formalism, a lot of the work is still
done on a conceptual level. This favours ChatGPT’s strong

language capabilities. We examine how strong ChatGPT’s
skills are, when it comes to combining, mixing, and syn-
thesising the relevant concepts. Furthermore, we explore
how we can use ChatGPT to our advantage in research,
outreach, and education.
This letter presents excerpts from a conversation2
between the author and ChatGPT, which begins with
broader and more general questions about the ﬁeld of
string theory, before narrowing it down to speciﬁc swamp-
land conjectures3 and ChatGPT’s understanding of them.
We attempt to highlight strengths and weaknesses of
ChatGPT, present some use cases, and raise some red-ﬂags.
We start with the question ‘Can you give me a deﬁnition
of ChatGPT?’.4
ChatGPT is a natural language
processing (NLP) model developed
by OpenAI that is specifically
designed to generate human-like
text in real-time chat environments.
It is based on the GPT (Generative
Pre-training Transformer) model,
which is a type of machine learning
model that has been trained on a
large dataset of human-generated
text and is capable of generating
text that is similar to human writing
in terms of style, structure, and
content.
The purpose of ChatGPT is to
enable the creation of chatbots or
conversational agents that can engage
in natural and engaging conversations
with users.
ChatGPT can be used in
a variety of applications, such as

customer service chatbots, personal
assistants, or educational chatbots.
It can generate responses to user
input based on the context of the
conversation, allowing it to carry
on a conversation in a way that is
natural and human-like.
ChatGPT has a vast knowledge of a variety of subjects
and can produce surprisingly elegant or creative explan-
ations of concepts. It can be used to obtain deﬁnitions
and explanations of concepts in diﬀerent styles, e.g. to
explain string theory to a high-school student:
String theory is a theoretical
framework in physics that attempts
to reconcile quantum mechanics
and general relativity, two of the
fundamental theories that describe
the behavior of the universe.
It
is based on the idea that the
fundamental building blocks of the
universe are not particles, but
rather tiny, vibrating strings.
According to string theory, the
fundamental forces of nature (such
as gravity, electromagnetism,
and the strong and weak nuclear
forces) are not caused by the
exchange of particles, but rather
by the vibration of these strings.
Different patterns of vibration
correspond to different particles
and forces.
One of the key predictions of
string theory is the existence of
extra dimensions beyond the three
dimensions of space and one dimension
of time that we are familiar with.
These extra dimensions may be hidden
from our everyday experience, but
they could potentially play a role in
the behavior of particles and forces
at very small scales.
Although string theory is still
being developed and is not yet
a fully developed theory, it has
the potential to provide a deeper
understanding of the fundamental
nature of the universe and could
potentially resolve some of the
outstanding problems in physics.
Using ChatGPT’s ability to impersonate a predeﬁned
persona can help the user to ﬁnd the right words for her
target audience. ChatGPT can be asked to rephrase a
given paragraph in a given style, or can directly be asked
to present the answer in the words of a character. The
given answer regarding string theory covers all relevant
points and is adequate for a high-school student. Fur-
thermore, if there is no simple answer or the answer is
less clear, an attempt will be made to provide one. As
the following response demonstrates, ChatGPT’s response
to the question ‘What is the most important equation in
string theory?’ is sound and even includes equations that
frequently appear in string theory.
It is difficult to identify a
single ’most important’ equation
in string theory, as the theory
is still being developed and is
not yet a fully formulated and
complete theory.
String theory is
a theoretical framework that attempts
to reconcile quantum mechanics and
general relativity, and it involves a
wide range of mathematical concepts
and equations.
One equation that is often
associated with string theory is
the Euler-Lagrange equation, which
is a mathematical expression that
describes the motion of a system in
terms of its energy.
This equation
plays a role in the formulation of
string theory, as it is used to
describe the behavior of strings
and the forces that act on them.
Another important equation in string
theory is the Schrödinger equation,
which is a mathematical expression
that describes how the quantum state
of a system changes over time.
The
Schrödinger equation is a fundamental
equation of quantum mechanics and
is used to describe the behavior of
particles on the quantum level.
It is worth noting that string
theory is a very complex and
interdisciplinary field, and
there are many other equations
and mathematical concepts that are
important to the development of the
theory.
These include the Einstein
field equations, which describe the
fundamental nature of gravity, and
various equations that describe the
behavior of particles and forces at
very small scales.
As a follow-up question, we asked ChatGPT what those
equations look like. The answer, along with general ex-
planations of what the diﬀerent terms mean and what the

3
equations describe, was:
L −∂L
∂q

where the expansion of the Einstein equation in terms of
the Ricci tensor and Ricci scalar was only provided on
explicit request.
II.
SWAMPLAND CONJECTURES
To put ChatGPT’s knowledge of swampland conjectures
to the test, we asked it ‘What do you know about the
string theoretical swampland program?’:
The swampland program is a research
program in string theory that aims
to identify and study the constraints
on the possible low-energy effective
theories that can emerge from string
theory.
It is based on the idea
that string theory may contain a vast
landscape of possible theories, and
that only a small subset of these
theories correspond to physically
realistic models of the universe.
The swampland program seeks to
identify the criteria that must
be satisfied by a low-energy
effective theory in order for it to
be consistent with string theory.
These criteria are known as the
swampland conditions.
The swampland
program has led to the development
of several important conjectures and
criteria, including the swampland
distance conjecture, the swampland de
Sitter conjecture, and the swampland
conjectures on trans-Planckian
censorship.
The swampland program is a highly
active and influential research
program in string theory and has
attracted a great deal of attention
and interest in the scientific
community.
It has the potential to
provide important insights into the
fundamental nature of the universe
and the structure of string theory.
It provides three examples of swampland conjectures in
its response: the distance conjecture [5–9], the de Sitter
conjecture [5, 6, 8, 10–13] as well as the trans-Planckian
censorship conjecture [6, 14, 15]. There are other conjec-
tures. ChatGPT gladly provides a list of 25 conjectures
upon request:
1. The distance conjecture
2. The de Sitter conjecture
3. The weak gravity conjecture
4. The trans-Planckian censorship
conjecture
5. The scalar weak gravity conjecture
6. The bound on entropy conjecture
7. The no global symmetries conjecture
8. The no parametrically large global
symmetries conjecture
9. The sublattice conjecture
10. The gradient conjecture
11. The dS distance conjecture
12. The trans-Planckian censorship
principle
13. The dS swampland conjecture
14. The swampland dS conjecture
15. The dS conjecture
16. The averaged null energy condition
conjecture
17. The trans-Planckian censorship
criterion
18. The quantum gravity conjecture
19. The string swampland conjecture
20. The swampland distance conjecture
21. The swampland de Sitter conjecture
22. The swampland weak gravity conjecture
23. The swampland trans-Planckian
censorship conjecture
24. The no global symmetries in quantum
gravity conjecture
25. The no parametrically large global
symmetries in quantum gravity
conjecture
In the previous paragraph, we already oﬀered sources
for numbers one, two, and four. Number three is also
a widely discussed conjecture, see.
e.g.
[6, 9, 16–23].
Number ﬁve also exists, see e.g. [6, 24, 25]. To our know-
ledge, there is no conjecture named the bound on entropy
conjecture. However, entropy bounds play an important
role in connections between the species scale, the distance
conjecture, the weak gravity conjecture, and the de Sit-
ter conjecture [6]. Number seven exists [6, 22, 26–29].
Number eight is made up. It sounds like a combination
of the distance conjecture and the no global symmetries
conjecture. Number nine exists and is a combination of

4
the distance conjecture and the weak gravity conjecture
[17, 30, 31]. Number ten is a conjecture in mathematics,
but not (yet?) in the swampland programme. Numbers el-
even through ﬁfteen are merely combinations of the names
of existing conjectures. Number sixteen was new to the
author of this letter, but was somewhat discussed roughly
a decade ago [32–35]. The remaining conjectures on the
list are just word baublery, i.e. combinations of existing
terms but not original conjectures. This example shows
two things: First, ChatGPT cannot separate a concept
from a word. If several words describe the same concept,
it is not necessarily able to identify the synonyms — it
often can provide synonyms for words, however, in this
example it states diﬀerent names for the same conjecture
as diﬀerent conjectures. Second, ChatGPT presents a fab-
ricated response very conﬁdently. In this example, it tries
to comply with the request, without indicating that there
actually is no list of 25 conjectures and that it made up
most of them. Nevertheless, it achieves impressive results
in terms of naming, and it makes certain to incorporate
well-known conjectures. Nevertheless, it is also possible
the prompt was not well-written, since it did not specify
that it has to be a list of 25 unique and independent
conjectures.
To further examine ChatGPT’s capabilities, we focus
on speciﬁc swampland conjectures and ask ChatGPT for
deﬁnitions and relations in the following subsections.
A.
The Weak Gravity Conjecture
Gravity is the weakest force. No observation was made
so far to contradict this statement. According to the Weak
Gravity Conjecture (WGC), this is true for all string the-
oretical compactiﬁcations [16]. More precisely, the WGC
says that there is a stable particle whose repulsive gauge
force exceeds the attractive gravitational force and which
minimises the mass-to-charge ratio m/q, i.e. |m/q| < 1
[16].
A more formal deﬁnition of the WGC reads as follows:
In a theory with a U(1) gauge symmetry; gauge coupling
g; and action
S =
Z
ddX√−g

q the charge of the particle, exists [6, 17].
ChatGPT knows the following about the WGC:
The weak gravity conjecture (WGC)
is a conjecture in theoretical
physics that proposes a connection
between the strength of a theory’s
gravitational force and the existence
of charged particles or objects with
extremely large charge-to-mass ratios.
The conjecture was originally
proposed by Cumrun Vafa and Alexander
Westphal in 2006, and it has since
become an important concept in
the study of string theory and the
swampland program.
The basic idea behind the WGC is
that in any theory that contains
a consistent low-energy effective
description of gravity, there must
be at least one particle or object
with a charge-to-mass ratio that
is larger than the charge-to-mass
ratio of a extremal black hole in
that theory.
This means that in
any theory that satisfies the WGC,
it should be possible to create
a particle or object with a large
enough charge-to-mass ratio that it
can overcome the gravitational force
and escape to infinity.
The WGC has been motivated by the
desire to understand the behavior
of charged particles and objects in
theories with a consistent low-energy
effective description of gravity,
and it has led to the development
of several important results and
insights in the field of theoretical
physics.
However, the conjecture is
still being actively studied and is
not yet fully understood.
Nothing in this statement is obviously wrong, as
it remains rather vague while naming the relevant
concepts that one might expect being mentioned.
However, the remark ‘The conjecture was originally
proposed by Cumrun Vafa and Alexander Westphal
in 2006,[...]’ is interesting. When prompted for a
source, ChatGPT responds with
The weak gravity conjecture was
originally proposed by Cumrun Vafa
and Alexander Westphal in a paper
published in 2008 titled ‘A Stringy
Test of the Fate of the Landscape’.
The paper was published in the
journal Physical Review D and can
be found online at the following
link:
https://journals.aps.org/prd/
abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.78.046003

ChatGPT even provides a summary of this paper.5 In its
previous answer, ChatGPT mentioned a paper written in
2006. Here, it provides a paper written in 2008. It sticks
to the authors, though. However, no such paper exists!
The two authors never published together, and the title is
ﬁctitious. The provided link leads to the paper Toward an
AdS/cold atoms correspondence: A geometric realization
of the Schrödinger symmetry by D. T. Son [36]. A better
answer might have been Arkani-Hamed et al. [16]. This
again shows that the user of ChatGPT has to be cautious
when using ChatGPT’s answers. They are grammatically
correct but not necessarily factual.
When asked for the most important, peer-reviewed,
and published papers about the weak gravity conjecture,
ChatGPT returns the following:
• "The Weak Gravity Conjecture"
by N. Arkani-Hamed, L. Motl, A.
Nicolis, and C. Vafa (Journal of High
Energy Physics, 2006).
This paper
introduced the concept of the weak
gravity conjecture and discussed its
implications for quantum gravity.
• "The Weak Gravity Conjecture from
Emergence" by J. Kim, B. Vercnocke,
and T. Wiseman (Journal of High
Energy Physics, 2017).
This paper
discussed the relationship between
the weak gravity conjecture and
emergent gravity, and proposed a new
version of the conjecture.
• "The Weak Gravity Conjecture and
Emergence of Strong Coupling" by J.
Kim, B. Vercnocke, and T. Wiseman
(Physical Review Letters, 2018).
This
paper discussed the relationship
between the weak gravity conjecture
and the emergence of strong coupling,
and proposed a new version of the
conjecture.
• "The Weak Gravity Conjecture
and Swampland Conjectures" by N.
Arkani-Hamed, Y. Bai, and R. Sundrum
5 In this paper, Vafa and Westphal proposed the weak
gravity conjecture as a way to address certain problems
that arise in the context of string theory, including
the existence of a vast landscape of possible vacua
and the difficulty of constructing stable de Sitter
vacua.
The conjecture suggests that in any consistent
theory of quantum gravity, there must exist particles
or fields with charge-to-mass ratios that are larger
than a certain critical value.
This has implications
for the stability of de Sitter vacua and the nature
of black hole entropy.
The weak gravity conjecture
has since become an important part of the swampland
program, and it continues to be studied and refined by
researchers in the field.
(Journal of High Energy Physics,
2020).
This paper discussed the
relationship between the weak gravity
conjecture and other swampland
conjectures, and proposed a new
version of the conjecture that
incorporates these other conjectures.
All the papers it provides have eerily similar titles — and
not a single one does actually exist. The titles are in-
triguing. Even the brief summaries sound plausible. Some
of the authors even publish in this or similar branches of
physics (N. Arkani-Hamed, L. Motl, A. Nicolis, C. Vafa
[16], B. Vercnocke [37, 38], R. Sundrum [39]) while oth-
ers publish in other ﬁelds or are made up (J. Kim, T.
Wiseman, Y. Bai).
The responses it provides sound convincing and rich in
detail, even though everything is wholly fabricated. This
might make its answer unreliable, but can, if wisely done,
used to our advantage! Speciﬁcally, it can be used to ﬁnd
interesting and helpful analogies. For instance, we might
be looking for a more down to earth analogy and ask
ChatGPT to explain the WGC in the words of a farmer:
The weak gravity conjecture is a
concept in theoretical physics
that proposes that the strength
of a theory’s gravitational force
is related to the existence of
charged particles or objects with
extremely large charge-to-mass ratios.
Essentially, this means that the
stronger the gravitational force,
the more likely it is that there are
charged particles or objects present
that can affect the force.
From a farmer’s perspective, this
concept could be compared to the
importance of understanding and
managing the weather and climate
conditions in a particular region.
By understanding how different
weather patterns and phenomena (such
as storms, wind, and humidity) can
affect their crops, farmers can
make informed decisions about when
to plant, water, and harvest, and
can optimize the productivity and
sustainability of their fields.
Similarly, the weak gravity
conjecture suggests that the strength
of a theory’s gravitational force
can be analyzed and predicted based
on the presence of charged particles
or objects.
This concept can be
useful for farmers who are looking
to optimize the productivity and
sustainability of their fields, by

6
helping them to understand and manage
the various forces and phenomena that
can affect their crops.
It’s a bit far-fetched to assume that the WGC can
be used to optimise agricultural productivity. However,
to communicate the concept in outreach or educational
activities, drawing parallels between the environmental
conditions’ impact on the yield and the impact of the
description of the gravitational force on the observed
particles, might be helpful.
Especially in outreach and education, we like to work
with images and representations of concepts. We can use
ChatGPT to generate visual representations of a concept’s
core ideas. We asked ChatGPT to describe how it envisions
the weak gravity conjecture. The response served as a
prompt for Stable Diﬀusion6, which then creates an image
based on ChatGPT’s description. The outcome is shown
in ﬁg. 1. Admittedly, this is more of an aesthetic picture
than a simpliﬁed illustration of the concept.
B.
de Sitter Conjecture
Another widely discussed swampland conjecture is the
de Sitter conjecture.
It states that for a scalar ﬁeld
potential V (φ)
|∇V | ≥
c
MP
· V,
(7)
with MP the Planck mass and c a constant of order one
[6, 8, 10, 11]. It is a strong conjecture, as it not only rules
out metastable de Sitter vacua but also local maxima and
saddle points [11]. When the acceleration is driven by
dark energy, then dark energy must be dynamical, i.e.
the equation of state is time-dependent, if dark energy is
represented by a rolling scalar ﬁeld [6, 12].
When asked what the de Sitter conjecture implies for
the standard model of cosmology, ChatGPT replies:
The de Sitter conjecture is a
conjecture in theoretical physics
that states that it is impossible to
construct a stable de Sitter space
(a type of space with a positive
cosmological constant) within the
framework of string theory.
This
conjecture has been motivated by the
desire to understand the behavior of
theories with a positive cosmological
constant and the challenges that
they pose to the standard model of
particle physics.
If the de Sitter conjecture is
true, it could have significant

the weak gravity conjecture: ‘The image should depict a
bright, glowing orb representing the strength of the
gravitational force, surrounded by swirling darkness
representing charged particles or objects affected
by this force.

convey a sense of wonder and excitement, as the

this mysterious and elusive concept in theoretical
physics.’ Image created by Stable Diﬀusion [40].
implications for the standard
model of cosmology, which is the
current leading theory of the origin,
evolution, and ultimate fate of
the universe.
The standard model
of cosmology is based on the idea
that the universe is expanding at
an accelerating rate, driven by a
mysterious form of energy known
as dark energy.
The standard
model of cosmology also includes
the hypothesis that the universe
underwent a period of rapid expansion
known as cosmic inflation in the very
early universe.
If the de Sitter conjecture is
true, it would suggest that the
standard model of cosmology may
need to be revised in order to
be consistent with string theory.
This could involve modifying or
replacing the current hypothesis
of cosmic inflation or finding an
alternative explanation for the

7
observed accelerating expansion
of the universe.
The de Sitter
conjecture is an active area of
research in the field of theoretical
physics, and it is still not fully
understood.
Further research will be
needed to determine the implications
of the de Sitter conjecture for the
standard model of cosmology and other
areas of physics.
ChatGPT is able to provide a relatively vague, surface-
level explanation of the key concepts. It identiﬁes ac-
celerated expansion and inﬂation as the most important
aspects of the concordance model that may need to be
modiﬁed. ChatGPT learns from the written word. In the
context of the de Sitter conjecture, the most often dis-
cussed concepts are dark energy, accelerated expansion,
and inﬂation. Therefore, ChatGPT can make this connec-
tion. However, it cannot genuinely connect concepts and
infer implications no one else has yet thought of. This is
also illustrated by the following example.
The relationship between the de Sitter conjecture and
the weak gravity conjecture is rarely studied. ChatGPT
describes the relation between the de Sitter conjecture
and the weak gravity conjecture as follows:
The de Sitter conjecture and the
weak gravity conjecture (WGC) are two
separate conjectures in theoretical
physics that have been proposed
as part of the swampland program
in string theory.
However, there
is a connection between these two
conjectures, as they both involve the
concept of a positive cosmological
constant and the behavior of charged
particles or objects in theories with
a consistent low-energy effective
description of gravity.
The de Sitter conjecture states
that it is impossible to construct
a stable de Sitter space (a type of
space with a positive cosmological
constant) within the framework of
string theory.
This conjecture
has been motivated by the desire to
understand the behavior of theories
with a positive cosmological constant
and the challenges that they pose
to the standard model of particle
physics.
The WGC, on the other hand, proposes
a connection between the strength of
a theory’s gravitational force and
the existence of charged particles
or objects with extremely large
charge-to-mass ratios.
The WGC
has been motivated by the desire
to understand the behavior of
charged particles and objects in
theories with a consistent low-energy
effective description of gravity.
Although the de Sitter conjecture and
the WGC are two separate conjectures,
they are related in the sense that
they both involve the concept of a
positive cosmological constant and
the behavior of charged particles or
objects in theories with a consistent
low-energy effective description
of gravity.
They are both active
areas of research in the field of
theoretical physics and have the
potential to provide important
insights into the fundamental nature
of the universe and the structure of
string theory.
Since there is no mention of gravity in the de Sitter
conjecture and no mention of the cosmological constant
in the weak gravity conjecture, the response is largely
incorrect. Admittedly, it is challenging to ﬁnd analogies
and connections between the two conjectures.
In the
literature, one frequently encounters links between the
weak gravity conjecture and the distance conjecture [6, 9,
23, 30, 41, 42] and between the distance conjecture and
the de Sitter conjecture [43, 44]. It is expected that some
analogies could be drawn. However, no direct relations
are known and ChatGPT is at this stage not able to identify
them.
We ﬁnd that ChatGPT does not create truly novel know-
ledge. Nonetheless, it can assist us to think about concepts
in new terms. We’ve shown that ChatGPT can draw some
elusive parallels between agriculture and the weak gravity
conjecture. Here, we provide another example, by asking
ChatGPT to explain the de Sitter conjecture in terms of a
ﬁnancial advisor:
The de Sitter conjecture is a concept
in theoretical physics that relates
to the stability of certain spaces
known as de Sitter spaces.
These
spaces are characterized by a
positive cosmological constant, which
means that they are expanding at an
accelerating rate.
In the framework of string theory,
de Sitter spaces are believed to
be unstable, which has important
implications for our understanding
of the universe and the fundamental
nature of reality.
Essentially, it
means that certain types of spaces
and configurations may not be as
stable or long-lasting as we thought,

8
and that we need to be cautious when
considering them as possible models
or explanations for the universe.
From a financial perspective, this
could be compared to investing
in a company or asset that seems
stable and promising at first, but
ultimately turns out to be unstable
or risky.
It’s important to do
thorough research and analysis before
making any investments, and to be
aware of the potential risks and
uncertainties that may be involved.
In the same way, it’s important to
carefully consider the implications
of the de Sitter conjecture and
to approach it with caution and
skepticism.
Both, ﬁnancial markets and de Sitter space require
thorough investigation to identify instability points and
can be in conﬁgurations that are (quasi)stable over a
limited period. To be cautious is never bad advice, neither
when it comes to investment decisions nor when it comes
to model universes and theory development.
We conclude this section by ﬁg. 27, which represents
the de Sitter conjecture and could be used as a cover
image for a book chapter or a slide deck.

OUTLOOK
In the previous paragraphs, we show that ChatGPT can
synthesise various concepts and present them coherently.
It succeeds in highlighting the core ideas and identify-
ing the relevant keywords. It excels at combining what
is known. However, it cannot genuinely make new con-
nections or create new knowledge. Nevertheless, it is a
useful tool for education and outreach. It helps us to
rephrase and ﬁnd the right words for our target audience.
It can be used to formulate analogies and ﬁnd parallels
to other ﬁelds. It can summarise what we already know.
In the module Physics in Society8 at Durham University,
ChatGPT scored 71 ± 2 %, where students score 71 ± 5 %
on short, 300-words essays [4].
The same case study
shows low, single-digit percentages for plagiarism using
TurnitIn9 and Grammarly10. It is worth noting that there
are tools to indicate the use of GPT11. However, detec-
tion could be evaded by using rephrasing tools such as

tool can be found, which uses the GPT 2 dataset [46, 47]
Figure 2.
ChatGPT’s description of an image represent-
ing the de Sitter conjecture:
‘The image should depict
a bright, glowing sphere representing a de Sitter
space, surrounded by a vast and complex landscape
of theories and configurations.
The sphere should
represent the stability of the de Sitter space,
and the landscape around it should represent the
theories and configurations that are affected by
this stability.
The overall tone of the image
should convey a sense of wonder and excitement,
as the viewer approaches the sphere and learns
more about this mysterious and elusive concept in
theoretical physics.’ Image created by DALL-E 2 [45].
QuillBot12. It is up to the teacher to decide whether
essays are still a meaningful form of assessment. ChatGPT
is a new and powerful tool to craft short essays. It can
help non-native speakers overcome language barriers by
assisting them in formulating their ideas and insights.
Posters are another application, where ChatGPT comes
in handy. Assume you want to make a poster for a general
science venue to present the swampland conjectures. You
can then ask ChatGPT to write short paragraphs on a
selection of swampland conjectures, a brief introduction
to string theory and the swampland programme, prompt
it to suggest a catchy title, and even have it describe some
illustrations, which you can then create using other AI
tools like Stable Diﬀusion, DALL-E, or MidJourney13 (see
ﬁgs. 1 and 2 for examples). Then, you include the relevant
formulas you want to discuss, create graphs that adhere
to scientiﬁc standards, and weave everything together.

You can concentrate on the poster’s conceptualisation
because you spend less time writing the paragraphs.
In the near future, we will see a variety of AI-tools.
They are already powerful companions that can be used
in tandem. A ChatGPT produced text can be rephrased
using QuillBot. An image description by ChatGPT can be
used as an input prompt for DALL-E, Stable Diﬀusion,
or MidJourney to create a visualisation. ChatGPT can be
used to write a whole script for a video tutorial, which can
then be used in Fliki14, to create a video, based on the
script, including animations and a computer-generated
voice.
These tools are already very user-friendly, but
further development is underway. Moreover, with GPT-4,
the framework behind ChatGPT will get a major upgrade
in the near future [48].

CONCLUSION
As a natural language processing model, ChatGPT is
naturally good with words. If assigned a task it can only
partially fulﬁl, it uses its abilities to come up with an
answer and presents it with full conﬁdence, even if the
answer is inaccurate. This can be used to one’s advantage,
if one is able to identify the made up parts of an answer.
Perhaps those parts start a thought process that leads to
new insights. Asking ChatGPT to respond in the style of
a given persona can help us ﬁnd new and helpful parallels
to other ﬁelds. This is of great use for educational and
outreach endeavours. ChatGPT is an always-on sparring
partner who is eager to assist and collaborate, when it
comes to testing ideas and concepts. At its current state, it
is not well suited to gain new knowledge or answer genuine
questions. It will respond with absolute assurance, but the
answer might be utterly false and completely fabricated.
Nevertheless, its capabilities are astounding. We are on
the brink of an AI-aided era of advancement if used with
caution.

DISCLAIMER
The creation of this letter was assisted by the chatbot
ChatGPT by OpenAI [1]. Speciﬁcally, everything written
in typewriter is a ChatGPT output. Furthermore, the title
of this letter was proposed by ChatGPT itself. The images
were created by DALL-E 2 [45] and Stable Diﬀusion [40].

The average power consumption per request of ChatGPT,
DALL-E or Stable Diﬀusion are not public. Furthermore,
it is not clear whether the energy used to train the models
should also be taken into account, when estimating the
CO2-equivalent of this article. The author’s personal com-
puter caused less than 100 g CO2e and is compensated
by https://climeworks.com. To internalise possible ad-
ditional external factors, 1 kg of CO2 was compensated
to cover for this work. Therefore, we consider this work
as probably carbon-neutral.
