PREFACE
xi
Despite the often extreme specialization and intimate knowledge required
to make a contribution to science, most scientific disciplines are quick to
adapt new technologies and advances developed from other fields.
Inevitably, a new vocabulary follows these advances, the purpose of which
is to convey meaning with a word that once required a descriptive para-
graph or even a page.
The Encyclopedia of Biology pulls together the specialized terminolo-
gy that has found its way into the language of the biologist. It addresses
the often duplicitous meanings in an easily understood, succinct fashion.
As each discipline has become more of a specialty, each has developed
terms that serve as a shorthand for concepts within that discipline. On rare
occasion, different disciplines develop the same term with radically differ-
ent definitions. By indicating a discipline, the encyclopedia directs the
reader to a definition relevant to the topic at hand. An example of this is
the word genotype. Historically, this was a taxonomist’s term meaning
“the type of the genus.” The genotype is important for classification and
evolutionary studies. Subsequently, geneticists used genotype to refer to 
the genetic makeup of an organism. One needs to understand not only the
meaning of words, but must also be able to put them in the context of the
period in which they were written.
There will be new terms, new (and defunct) science Websites, new
leaders, new disciplines, and even breathtaking new discoveries in science,
but these will not detract from the utility of this encyclopedia. Bibliophiles
need only pause to consider which books they consult most frequently.
The reference book holds counsel over all others. Facts On File’s Encyclo-
pedia of Biology may not read like a novel, but it will help you read like a
biologist.

INTRODUCTION
xiii
Facts On File’s Encyclopedia of Biology is a reference to help in under-
standing the basic concepts in biology and its peripheral disciplines like
ecology, botany, and even Earth science. Arranged in alphabetical order,
the entries include biographies of individuals who have made major contri-
butions as well as numerous line illustrations and photographs to help in
visualizing technical concepts.
I have tried to include the more common terms you will likely
encounter during your educational experience or even when you are out in
the “real” world. There are literally thousands of biological terms. Many
are so specific to major or minor subdisciplines of biology that you may
never encounter them. You will not find those esoteric terms in this ency-
clopedia but, rather, a collection of terms that you should be familiar with
to understand core biological principles and have a working knowledge of
the field. You can also use this volume simply to increase your scientific
vocabulary. A series of well-placed essays elaborate on some of the most
important trends and issues in the field. One of these describes how the use
of computer technology has revealed an artificial toe in a mummy that is
thousands of years old. You will also learn how blood is used in forensic
science to capture criminals and read about the latest trends in human
cytogenetics. Other essays will make you think about your role in the
world and explore some of the negative effects we humans have had on the
biological world, in particular to the insect family.
The encyclopedia also includes appendixes with information about
Internet Websites and biology-related software that is waiting for you to
explore.
We humans are part of this immense biological world, and we interact
with it in many ways. Some of those interactions have cost species their
very existence. Some have helped us survive disease. In other cases, we
have helped species come back from the brink of extinction. This complex
interrelationship is not clearly understood even today, and that is why
many who use this book are pursuing some aspect of biology as a career.
We have come a long way from Robert Hooke’s first observation of a
cell under a crude microscope to today’s observations of atomic-level
activity using electron microscopes. The use of computer science and tech-
nology has enabled huge leaps in our understanding of our biological

world. The future hope of nanotechnology, using small robots to scurry
through our bodies to fix organs or cure disease, is closer to becoming
reality than it is to fiction. Other former sci-fi issues, like cloning humans,
are on the forefront of discussion, and some have even claimed human
cloning has happened. The mapping of our entire genetic makeup brings
promise to thousands of people who have or carry genetically based dis-
ease. This has led at least one scientist to declare that we are moving into
the “industrial revolution of biology,” anticipating the exciting discoveries
just around the corner from the analysis of all this genetic information.
We are entering a world of molecular understanding of developmental
biology all the way to the enigma of consciousness. But you cannot leap
without first taking small steps. Use this book for the small steps, and
heed the words of Cornell biologist James G. Needham (1888–1957),
who once wrote:
It is a monstrous abuse of the science of biology to teach it only in
the laboratory—Life belongs in the fields, in the ponds, on the
mountains, and by the seashore.
So, armed with this book, consider that your next assignment.

Introduction

ENTRIES A–Z


ABO blood groups
Blood group antibodies (A, B,
AB, O) that may destroy red blood cells bearing the anti-
gen to which they are directed; also called “agglutinins.”
These red-cell antigens are the phenotypic expression of
inherited genes, and the frequency of the four main
groups varies in populations throughout the world. 
The antigens of the ABO system are an integral part of
the red-cell membrane as well as all cells throughout the
body and are the most important in transfusion practice.
See also LANDSTEINER, KARL.
abortion
The termination of gestation before the
fetus can survive on its own.
abscisic acid (ABA)
A plant hormone (C15H20O4)
and weak acid that generally acts to inhibit growth,
induces dormancy, and helps the plant tolerate stressful
conditions by closing stomata. Abscisic acid was
named based on a belief that the hormone caused the
abscission (shedding) of leaves from deciduous trees
during the fall.
At times when a plant needs to slow down growth
and assume a resting (dormant) stage, abscisic acid is
produced in the terminal bud, which slows down
growth and directs the leaf primordia to develop scales
that protect the dormant bud during winter. Because
the hormone also inhibits cell division in the vascular
cambium, both primary and secondary growth are put
on hold during winter.
This hormone also acts as a stress agent that helps
a plant deal with adverse conditions. For example,
ABA accumulates on leaves and causes stomata to
close, reducing the loss of water when a plant begins to
wilt.
In 1963, abscisic acid was first identified and char-
acterized by Frederick Addicott and colleagues. In
1965, the chemical structure of ABA was defined, and
in 1967, it was formally called abscisic acid.
absorption spectrum
Different pigments absorb
light of different wavelengths. For example, chloro-
phyll effectively absorbs blue and red. The absorption
spectrum of a pigment is produced by examining,
through the pigment and an instrument called a spec-
troscope, a continuous spectrum of radiation. The
energies removed from the continuous spectrum by the
absorbing pigment show up as black lines or bands and
can be graphed.
abyssal zone
The portion of the ocean floor below
1,000–2,000 m (3,281–6,561 ft.), where light does not
penetrate and where temperatures are cold and pres-
sures are intense. It lies seaward of the continental
slope and covers approximately 75 percent of the
ocean floor. The temperature does not rise above 4°C.
Because oxygen is present, a diverse community of
invertebrates and fishes do exist, and some have adapt-
ed to harsh environments such as hydrothermal vents
1
A

of volcanic creation. Food-producing organisms at this
depth are chemoautotrophic prokaryotes and not pho-
tosynthetic producers.
See also OCEANIC ZONE.
acclimatization
Acclimatization is the progressive
physiological adjustment or adaptation by an organ-
ism to a change in an environmental factor, such as
temperature, or in conditions that would reduce the
amount of oxygen to its cells. This adjustment can
take place immediately or over a period of days or
weeks. For example, the human body produces more
erythrocytes (red blood cells) in response to low par-
tial pressures of oxygen at high altitudes; short-term
responses include shivering or sweating in warm-
blooded animals.
accommodation
The automatic reflex adjustment
that allows the focal length of the lens of an eye to
change to focus on an object. The lens shape, more
convex for near objects and less convex for distant
objects, is caused by ciliary muscles acting on the elas-
tic property of the lens.
acetylcholine
(ACh)
One of the most common
neurotransmitters of the vertebrate nervous system,
ACh is a chemical (CH3COOCH2CH2N+(CH3)3) that
transmits impulses between the ends of two adjacent
nerves or neuromuscular junctions. Released by nerve
stimulation (exciting or inhibiting), it is confined large-
ly to the parasympathetic nervous system, where it dif-
fuses across the gap of the synapse and stimulates the
adjacent nerve or muscle fiber. It rapidly becomes inac-
tive by the enzyme cholinesterase, allowing further
impulses to occur.
acetyl CoA
A compound formed in the mitochon-
dria when the thiol group (–SH) of coenzyme A com-
bines with an acetyl group (CH3CO–). It is important
in the Krebs cycle in cellular respiration and plays a
role in the synthesis and oxidation of fatty acids.
Fritz Albert Lipmann (1899–1986), a biochemist,
is responsible for discovering coenzyme A and cofactor
A, or CoA (A stands for acetylation), in 1947. He
shared the 1953 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine
with HANS KREBS.
See also KREBS CYCLE.
achiral
See CHIRALITY.
acid
A chemical capable of donating a HYDRON (pro-
ton, H+) or capable of forming a covalent bond with
an electron pair. An acid increases the hydrogen ion
concentration in a solution, and it can react with cer-
tain metals, such as zinc, to form hydrogen gas. A
strong acid is a relatively good conductor of electricity.
Examples of strong acids are hydrochloric (muriatic),
nitric, sulfuric, while examples of mild acids are sul-
furous and acetic (vinegar). The strength of an acidic
solution is usually measured in terms of its pH (a loga-
rithmic function of the H+ ion concentration). Strong
acid solutions have low pHs (typically around 0–3),
while weak acid solutions have pHs in the range 3–6.
See also BASE; PH SCALE.
acidity constant
The equilibrium constant for split-
ting off a HYDRON from a BRØNSTED ACID.
acid-labile sulfide
Refers to sulfide LIGANDs, e.g.,
the BRIDGING
LIGANDs
in IRON–SULFUR
PROTEINS,
which are released as H2S at acid pH.
See also FERREDOXIN.
acid precipitation
Because pure precipitation (e.g.,
rain) is slightly acidic (due to the reaction between
water droplets and carbon dioxide, creating carbonic
acid) with a potential pH of 5.6, acid precipitation
refers to precipitation with a pH less than 5.6. Acid
precipitation includes rain, fog, snow, and dry deposi-
tion. Anthropogenic (man-made) pollutants (carbon
dioxide, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen and sulfur
oxides, and hydrocarbons) react with water vapor to
produce acid precipitation. These pollutants come pri-
marily from burning coal and other fossil fuels. Sulfur
dioxide, which reacts readily with water vapor and
droplets (i.e., has a short residence time in the atmo-
sphere as a gas), has been linked to the weathering
2
acclimatization

(eating away) of marble structures and the acidifica-
tion of freshwater lakes (consequently killing fish).
Natural interactions within the biosphere can also lead
to acid precipitation.
acoelomate
A solid-bodied animal lacking a body
cavity, the space between the gut (digestive tract) and
body wall. Simple animals do not have a body cavity
as higher animals do; this body cavity is called a
coelom in mammals and contains the gut (a cavity by
itself), heart, and lungs, for example. Acoelomates are
bilateral animals and are triploblastic (have three lay-
ers: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm). They can
move forward and have a degree of cephalization
(centralization of neural and sensory organs in the
head).
Representative phyla of acoelomates are the Platy-
helminthes: flatworms that include the Turbellaria
(nonconfined flatworms such as planarians), Monoge-
nea (monogeneans), Trematoda (trematodes, or flukes),
and Cestoidea (tapeworms). There are more than
20,000 species of flatworms living in wet environments
such as marine or freshwater bodies and damp terres-
trial areas.
See also COELOM.
aconitase
A name for citrate (isocitrate) hydro-LYASE
(aconitate hydratase), which catalyzes the interconver-
sion of citrate, cis-aconitate ((Z)-prop-1-ene-1,2,3-tri-
carboxylate), and isocitrate. The active 
ENZYME
contains a catalytic [4FE-4S] CLUSTER.
acrosome
The acrosome is a special area or com-
partment that is located at the tip of the head of a
sperm cell. It contains special digestive enzymes that on
contact with the egg help the sperm head penetrate the
egg for fertilization. Directly behind the acrosome is the
haploid nucleus (single set of unpaired chromosomes)
that contains the genetic material.
See also FERTILIZATION.
actin
A globular protein found in muscle tissue as
thin filaments and in microfilaments that form portions
of cell cytoskeletons. Actin links into chains, and
paired chains twist helically around each other, forming
microfilaments in muscle and other contractile elements
in cells. Actin and myosin filaments interact to initiate
muscle contraction.
Tropomyosin and troponin are two protein
molecules associated with actin filaments in muscle.
Tropomyosin runs along the length of the actin fila-
ment and covers the area of the actin molecule that
interacts with myosin when at rest. On the other hand,
when a muscle is contracted, tropomyosin is replaced
with troponin as it binds to calcium ions. Troponin is
actin
3
acrosome
The acrosome is a special area or compartment that is located at
the tip of the head of a sperm cell.
Mariposa lily from California. An example of an actinomorphic,
radially symmetrical flower. (Courtesy of Tim McCabe)

located at regular intervals along the actin filament and
allows actin to interact with myosin.
See also CYTOSKELETON.
actinomorphic
Symmetrical over more than one ver-
tical plane; e.g., flowers that can be separated into sym-
metrical halves along any plane.
action potential
A localized rapid change in voltage
that occurs across the membrane of a muscle or nerve
cell when a nerve impulse is initiated. It is caused by a
physicochemical change in the membrane during the
interaction of the flow and exchange of sodium and
potassium ions.
See also DEPOLARIZATION.
active center
The location in an ENZYME where the
specific reaction takes place.
active site
The active site of an enzyme is the area—
a depressed region comprising a few of the protein’s
amino acids—on a portion of an enzyme that binds to
its substrate. The enzyme’s specificity is based on the
shape of the active area, which can alter itself to snugly
fit the substrate to which it is binding by using weak
chemical bonds.
See ACTIVE CENTER.
active transport
The movement of a substance
across a biological membrane, such as living cells,
against a concentration (diffusion) gradient with the
help of metabolic energy, usually provided by ATP
(adenosine triphosphate). Active transport serves to
maintain the normal balance of ions in cells, in particu-
lar ions of sodium and potassium, which play a vital
role in nerve and muscle cells. Because a molecule is
“pumped” across the membrane against its gradient
with the help of metabolic energy, it is referred to as
“active” transport.
The sodium–potassium “pump” that exchanges
sodium (Na+) for potassium (K+) across the plasma
membrane of animal cells is an example of the active
transport mechanism.
It is the carriage of a solute across a biological
membrane from low to high concentration that
requires the expenditure of metabolic energy.
adaptive radiation
The process where a popula-
tion of plants or animals evolves into a number of dif-
ferent ones over time, usually as a response to
multiplying and living under different environmental
conditions. Subpopulations from the common ances-
tor develop as a response to adapting to the new envi-
ronmental conditions, and new species evolve from
this original parent stock.
Impressive 
rapid 
adaptive 
radiations 
have
occurred over time after mass extinctions caused by
cataclysmic episodes on the Earth. Plate tectonics, vol-
canism, and possible Earth-comet-asteroid collisions
all have wiped the landscape clean, allowing survivors
and new species to rapidly fill the voids of these new
adaptive zones.
address-message concept
Refers to compounds 
in which part of the molecule is required for 
binding (address) and part for the biological action
(message).
adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP)
Key NUCLEOTIDE
in energy-dependent cellular reactions, in combination
with Mg(II). The reaction: ATP + water   ADP +
phosphate is used to supply the necessary energy.
See also ATP.
4
actinomorphic
Solanum species as an example of an actinomorphic flower from
Sierra Madre Oriental in Mexico. (Courtesy of Tim McCabe)

adenylyl cyclase
An enzyme, embedded in the
plasma membrane, that converts ATP to cyclic adeno-
sine monophosphate (cyclic AMP, or cAMP) in
response to a chemical signal. It is activated when a
signal molecule binds to a membrane receptor. Cyclic
AMP acts as a second messenger, relaying the signal
from the membrane to the metabolic machinery of
the cytoplasm.
adrenal 
glands
A
pair 
of 
small 
triangular
endocrine glands (one above each kidney in animals)
that 
are 
ductless 
and 
secrete 
hormones 
into 
the blood. The glands are composed of two portions.
The adrenal cortex, which forms an outer shell on
each and is controlled by the pituitary gland,
responds to endocrine signals in reacting to stress and
homeostatic conditions by (a) secreting steroid hor-
mones (corticosteroid, cortisol, and aldosterone) that
deal with carbohydrate metabolism and with salt and
water balance (electrolyte metabolism), such as the
reabsorption of water by the kidneys, and (b) releas-
ing androgens (male sex hormone) and estrogens
(female sex hormone).
The adrenal cortex surrounds the central medulla,
is controlled by the nervous system, and responds to
nervous inputs resulting from stress and produces
adrenaline and noradrenaline, hormones that increase
blood sugar level and reduce body fat. The adrenal
glands are also known as the suprarenal glands.
See also GLAND.
adrenodoxin
A [2FE-2S]
FERREDOXIN involved in
electron transfer from NADPH+ (the reduced form of
NADP [nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate,
a coenzyme]), via a REDUCTASE, to CYTOCHROME P-450
in the adrenal gland.
Adrian, Edgar Douglas (1889–1977) British Physi-
ologist
Edgar Douglas Adrian was born on Novem-
ber 30, 1889, in London to Alfred Douglas Adrian, a
legal adviser to the British Local Government Board.
He attended the Westminster School, London, and in
1908 enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge. At Cam-
bridge University, he studied physiology, receiving a
bachelor’s degree in 1911.
In 1913 he entered Trinity College, studied
medicine, did his clinical work at St. Bartholomew’s
Hospital, London, and received his M.D. in 1915.
In 1929 he was elected Foulerton professor of the
Royal Society and in 1937 became professor of physi-
ology at the University of Cambridge until 1951, when
he was elected master of Trinity College, Cambridge.
He was chancellor of the university from 1968 until
two years before his death.
He spent most of his research studying the physi-
ology of the human nervous system, particularly 
the brain, and how neurons send messages. In 
1932 he shared the Nobel Prize in physiology 
or medicine for his work on the function of the neu-
ron. He is considered one of the founders of modern
neurophysiology.
He wrote three books, The Basis of Sensation
(1927), The Mechanism of Nervous Action (1932), and
The Physical Basis of Perception (1947), and was
knighted baron of Cambridge in 1955. He died on
August 4, 1977, and is buried at Trinity College.

Adaptive radiation is the process where a population of plants or
animals evolves into a number of different ones over time, usually
as a response to multiplying and living under different environ-
mental conditions.

aerobic
Any organism, environmental condition, or
cellular process that requires atmospheric oxygen. Aer-
obic microorganisms, called aerobes, require the pres-
ence of oxygen for growth. An aerobe is capable of
using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor and can
tolerate oxygen levels higher than that present in the
air (21 percent oxygen). They have a respiratory type
of metabolism, and some aerobes are also capable of
growing anaerobically with electron accepters other
than oxygen.
See also ANAEROBIC.
affinity
The tendency of a molecule to associate with
another. The affinity of a DRUG is its ability to bind to
its biological target (RECEPTOR, ENZYME, transport sys-
tem, etc.). For pharmacological receptors, it can be
thought of as the frequency with which the drug, when
brought into the proximity of a receptor by diffusion,
will reside at a position of minimum free energy within
the force field of that receptor.
For an AGONIST (or for an ANTAGONIST), the
numerical representation of affinity is the reciprocal of
the 
equilibrium 
dissociation 
constant 
of 
the
ligand–receptor complex, denoted KA, calculated as the
rate constant for offset (k–1) divided by the rate con-
stant for onset (k1).
age structure
The relative number of individuals of
each age in a population, or the composition of a coun-
try by age groups. Since generations coexist over a time
period, an age structure develops and is important in
foreseeing the growth rate of an entire population.
Except for the “baby boom” generation of the late
1940s–50s, the United States has a pretty even age 
distribution.
Agnatha
A superclass family of jawless vertebrate
fish that probably originated during the late Precambri-
an or early Cambrian. This superclass is the source of
the oldest vertebrate fossils, dating some 465 million
years ago during the Paleozoic era. Early agnathans,
such as the now extinct ostracoderms, were encased in
bony plates. While most were small, no larger than 20
in., they lacked paired fins and had circular mouths or
slits with no jaws, although there were exceptions that
had paired fins. Agnathans were most likely bottom-
dwelling mud suckers or suspension feeders, taking in
food through the mouth and then trapped in the gill,
which also functioned as the area for gas exchange.
Only about 60 species comprising two classes of
agnathans exist today, while the rest declined and dis-
appeared during the Devonian period. Two classes, the
Myxini (hagfishes) and Cephalaspidormorphi (lam-
preys), are all that remain.
Both 
hagfishes 
and 
lampreys 
lack 
paired
appendages and lack body armor. Hagfishes are scav-
engers, living only in salt water and feeding on dead
fish or marine worms, and lack a larval stage. Lam-
preys use their round mouth and a rasping tongue to
latch on the side of a fish, penetrate the skin, and ingest
its blood. As larvae, they live in freshwater streams, are
suspension feeders, and migrate to the sea and lakes
when they become adults. Some species only feed while
in the larval stage, reproduce, and die. The agnathans
are considered the most primitive living vertebrates
known today.
agonist
An endogenous substance or a DRUG that
can interact with a RECEPTOR and initiate a physiologi-
cal or a pharmacological response characteristic of that
RECEPTOR (contraction, relaxation, secretion, ENZYME
activation, etc.).
agonistic behavior
This behavior usually involves
two animals in a competitive contest, which can be in
the form of combat, threat, or ritual, for food, a sexual
partner, or other need. The end result is one becoming
a victor while the other surrenders or becomes submis-
sive, both exhibiting different traits. When one surren-
ders, it stops the combat because the continued battle
could end up injuring both. Likewise, any future com-
bat between the two individuals will likely end with the
same result as the first and will not last as long.
Many animal social groups are maintained by ago-
nistic behavior where one individual becomes domi-
nant, others become subdominant, and so on down the
line, each controlling the others in a dominance hierar-
chy or “pecking order.” This dominant behavior can be
used to control access to food or mates. Chickens,
gorillas, and wolves are good examples of social groups
maintained by dominance.
6
aerobic

Agonistic behavior is used to defend territories,
areas that a dominant individual will defend for feeding,
mating, rearing, or any combination of these activities.
AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome)
AIDS
is the name given to the late stages of HIV infection,
first discovered in 1981 in Los Angeles, California. By
1983 the retrovirus responsible for it, the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), was first described, and
since then millions around the world have died from
contracting the disease. It is thought to have originated
in central Africa from monkeys or to have developed
from contaminated vaccines used in the world’s first
mass immunization for polio.
AIDS is acquired mostly by sexual contact either
through homo- or heterosexual practice by having
unprotected sex via vaginal or anal intercourse. The
routes of infection include infected blood, semen, and
vaginal fluid. The virus can also be transmitted by
blood by-products, through maternofetal infection
(where the virus is transmitted by an infected mother to
the unborn child in the uterus), or by maternal blood
during parturition, or by breast milk consumption
upon birth. Intravenous drug abuse also is a cause.
The virus destroys a subgroup of lymphocytes,
essential for combating infections, known as the helper
T cells, or CD4 lymphocytes, and suppresses the body’s
immune system, leaving it prone to infection.
Infection by the virus produces antibodies, but not
all those exposed develop chronic infection. For those
that do, AIDS or AIDS-related complex (ARC) bring
on a variety of ailments involving the lymph nodes,
intermittent fever, loss of weight, diarrheas, fatigue,
pneumonia, and tumors. A person infected, known as
HIV-positive, can remain disease-free for up to 10
years, as the virus can remain dormant before full-
blown AIDS develops.
While HIV has been isolated from bodily fluids
such as semen to breast milk, the virus does not survive
outside the body, and it is considered highly unlikely
that ordinary social contact can spread the disease.
However, the medical profession has developed high
standards to deal with handling blood, blood products,
and body fluids from HIV-infected people.
In the early discovery stage of the disease, AIDS
was almost certainly fatal, but the development of
antiviral drugs, such as zidovudine (AZT), didanosine
(ddl), zalcitabine (ddc), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine
(DAT), and protease inhibitors used in combination
with the others, has showed promise in slowing or
eradicating the disease. Initial problems with finding a
cure have to do with the fact that glycoproteins encas-
ing the virus display a great deal of variability in their
amino acid sequences, making it difficult to prepare a
specific AIDS vaccine.
During the 1980s and 1990s, an AIDS epidemic
brought considerable media coverage to the disease,
especially as well-known celebrities such as actors
Rock Hudson and Anthony Perkins, Liberace, and
others died from it. Hudson was the first to admit hav-
ing the disease in 1985. During the 1980s and 1990s,
the homosexual community became active in lobbying
for funds to study the disease, as it early on was con-
sidered simply a “gay” disease. ACT UP, acronym for
the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, began as a
grassroots AIDS organization associated with nonvio-
lent civil disobedience in 1987. ACT UP became the
standard-bearer for protest against governmental and

AIDS was first reported in 1981 in the United States and has since
become a major epidemic, killing nearly 12 million people and
infecting more than 30 million others worldwide. The disease is
caused by HIV, a virus that destroys the body’s ability to fight
infections and certain cancers. (Courtesy of Darryl Leja, NHGRI,

societal indifference to the AIDS epidemic. Public atti-
tude changed when heterosexuals became infected, and
greater education on the causes of the disease became
more widespread, initiated by celebrities such as Eliza-
beth Taylor and the American Foundation for AIDS
Research, where fundraising activities made national
news coverage.
There have been significant advances in the treat-
ment for HIV/AIDS by attacking the virus itself,
strengthening the immune system, and controlling
AIDS-related cancers and opportunistic infections. At
present, there is still no cure or vaccine.
albumin
A type of protein, especially a protein of
blood PLASMA, that transports various substances,
including metal ions, drugs, and XENOBIOTICs.
aldehydes
Aldehydes are organic chemicals that con-
tain the –CHO (aldehyde) group, a carbonyl group
(C=O) that has the carbon and hydrogen atom bound.
They are the result of the oxidation of alcohols and,
when 
further 
oxidized, 
form 
carboxylic 
acids.
Methanal (formaldehyde) and ethanal (acetaldehyde)
are common examples.
aldosterone
An adrenal steroid hormone, derived
from cholesterol, that is secreted by the adrenal cortex
and acts on the distal tubules of the kidney to control
the elimination of salts and water by the kidneys. The
presence of the pituitary hormone ACTH, changing
levels of sodium and potassium, and variations in
blood volume stimulate the production of aldosterone
by the cortex.
Aldosterone is a component of the rennin-
angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) that is a com-
plex feedback system that functions in homeostasis.
See also GLAND.
algae (singular, alga)
A large and diverse group of
photosynthetic organisms formerly called simple plants
but now members of their own phyla, the Protoctista,
that also includes the slime molds and protozoa. Algae,
some 17,000 species or more, live in aquatic and moist
inland regions. They do not have roots, stems, or leaves
and have no vascular water-conducting systems. They
reproduce by spores, and in some species the spores are
mobile with the use of flagella. They range from simple
single cells (e.g., Euglena) to “plants” many feet long
(e.g., kelps such as Macrocytis) and make up marine
seaweed and much of the plankton that provide food
for other species.
Unusual growth outbursts result in “algal blooms”
or “red tides” and occur when there is an increase in
nutrient levels in a body of water.
Cyanophyta, or blue-green algae, are now classi-
fied as cyanobacteria. The phylum Cyanophyta also
includes chloroxybacteria. Cyanophytes contain phyco-
cyanin, a photosynthetic pigment giving them a blue
color. The red pigment phycoerythrin is also almost
always present. They are diverse and can live as single
cells or as colonies or large filaments. Some are nitro-
gen fixers in soil and others, like lichens, display sym-
biosis with a fungus, usually with a member of
Ascomycota. The fungus provides the host plant for the
algae cells that are distributed throughout and provide
food to the fungus while the fungus protects the algae

HIV-infected white blood cell. Scanning electron micrograph
(SEM) of the abnormal surface of a white blood cell infected with
HIV virus that causes AIDS. Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) gene
expression for cell surface proteins is abnormal. The HIV virus’s
genetic material controls the cell, forcing it to express abnormal
structural proteins. Normally these surface GAG proteins are tiny
spheres, but here the cell’s outer surface is formed from large
irregular rods. HIV causes AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency 
syndrome). AIDS destroys white blood cells, leading to a weak-
ened immune system. Magnification: × 6600 at 4.5 × 5.5 inch size.

cells. While many lichen have a different fungi compo-
nent, they often have the same algae species. Some
common species of lichens are British soldiers (Clado-
nia cristatella), pixie cups (Cladonia grayi), cedar
lichen (Vulpicidia viridis),
wrinkled shield lichen
(Flavoparmelia caperata), and reindeer lichen (Cladina
subtenuis).
The chloroxybacteria, or green-grass bacteria, con-
tain both chlorophylls a and b but do not contain the
red or blue pigments of the blue-green algae. They are
nonmotile, aerobic organisms.
Other phyla of algae include the Bacillariophyceae,
comprising the diatoms; Charophyceae, fresh- or
brackish- water algae that resemble bryophytes;
Chlorophyceae, or green algae believed to be the pro-
genitor of plants; Chrysophyceae, or yellow-green
algae; Dinophyceae, unicellular algae with two flagella;
Phaeophyceae, or brown algae; and Rhodophyceae, or
red algae.
The Bacillariophyceae or diatoms are unicellular
algae that are found in single, colonial, or filamentous
states. Under the microscope they often are beautifully
symmetrical, as their cell walls, or frustules, are com-
posed of silica and are bivalved, one of which over-
laps the other, and the frustule is often punctated and
ornamented. The two orders, Centrales and Pennales,
occupy two different environments. The centric
diatoms (Centrales) are circular in shape with radial
symmetry and live mostly in marine environments.
The pennate diatoms (Pennales) are elliptical in shape,
have bilateral symmetry, and are found in freshwater
environments.
Deposits of fossil diatoms known as diatomaceous
earth have been mined and used for years in paints,
abrasives, and other products such as chalk. The
famous White Cliffs of Dover in England (rising to 300
feet) are composed of massive amounts of diatoms—
coccoliths—that were laid down some 790 million
years ago when Great Britain was submerged by a shal-
low sea.
The Charophyceae, also known as stoneworts, and
which resemble bryophytes, live in fresh and brackish
water especially rich in calcium, where they become
stiff and lime encrusted. The stoneworts consist of a
complex branched thallus with an erect stemlike struc-
ture and many whorls of short branches.
The Chlorophyceae (or green algae) are the closest
to plants in pigment composition and structure and are
related based on a common ancestor. More than 7,000
species live in freshwater and marine environments as
unicellular parts of plankton, in damp soil and even
snow as colonies or filaments, symbiotically with other
eukaryotes, or mutually with fungi as lichens.
The Chrysophyceae or golden algae, named
because of their yellow and brown carotene and xan-
thophyll pigments, are typically cells with two flagella
at one end of the cell, and many live among freshwater
and marine plankton. While most are unicellular, a few
are colonial.
The Dinophyceae or dinoflagellates are algae that
are unicellular with two flagella of unequal length con-
tained in channels on the cell surface. They can change
shape with different water temperatures and are very
tolerant of chemical and physical conditions.
The Phaeophyceae or brown algae are the largest
and most complex of the algae. All members are multi-
cellular, and the majority live in marine environments,
especially common in cool water along temperate coast-
lines. Many of the marine seaweeds are brown algae.
The Rhodophyceae or red algae are more recent
and have lost their flagellate stages in their life cycle.
Some species are actually black and not red, as those
that live deeper in waters, because of different levels of
the pigment phycoerythrin. While most are found in
warm coastal waters of the tropical oceans, some also
live in freshwater and on land in the soil. Most
rhodophytes are multicellular, sharing seaweed status
with brown algae.

Because the various forms of algae are now
assigned to different phyla, the words alga and algae
are used informally and have no taxonomic status.
allantois
During the embryonic stage of mammals,
birds, and reptiles, the allantois, a small sac, is one of
four extra-embryonic membranes (along with amnion,
yolk sac, chorion) and serves several functions, such as
a repository for the embryo’s nitrogenous waste (chiefly
uric acid) in reptiles and birds (in the egg). The allan-
tois provides oxygen to mammals, birds, and reptiles,
as well as food in mammals (via the placenta).
The membrane of the allantois works with the
chorion in respiratory functions, allowing the exchange
of gases between the embryo and surrounding air. In
humans, it is involved in the development of the uri-
nary bladder.
See also EMBRYO.
allele
An allele is one of two or more alternative forms
of a gene that can exist at a single locus. Each allele
therefore has a unique nucleotide sequence and may lead
to different phenotypes for a given trait. If the alleles for
a gene are identical, the organism is called homozygous.
If the alleles are different, the organism is heterozygous.
If two alleles are different, one becomes dominant
and is fully expressed in appearance in the organism,
while the other is recessive and has no noticeable effect
on the appearance of the organism.
This is shown in the color of your eyes, determined
by the genes inherited from your parents. The gene for
brown eyes is dominant and overrides genes for other
eye colors. The gene for blue eyes is recessive and will
appear when there are no genes for other eye colors. A
person with brown eyes may have a recessive, or “hid-
den,” gene for blue eyes. Therefore, two brown-eyed
parents may each give a recessive gene for blue eyes to
their child, who would then have blue eyes. Gray,
green, and other eye colors result from a complex mix-
ing of different eye color genes.

An allele is one of the variant forms of a gene at a particular locus, or location, on a chromosome. Different alleles produce variation in
inherited characteristics such as hair color or blood type. In an individual, one form of the allele (the dominant one) may be expressed
more than another form (the recessive one). (Courtesy of Darryl Leja, NHGRI, National Institutes of Health)

allochronic speciation
Speciation that takes place
related to time rather than space; populations that are
reproductively isolated due to mating at different times.
See also SPECIATION.
allometric growth
The variation in the relative rates
of growth of various parts of the body, which helps
shape the organism. In other words, it is the pattern of
growth whereby different parts of the body grow at
different rates with respect to each other. Allometry is
the study of relative growth and of changes in propor-
tion with increase in size. For example, human arms
and legs grow at a faster rate than the body and head,
making adult proportions strikingly different from
those of infants. Another striking example is the male
fiddler crab Uca pugnax. In small males, the two claws
are of equal weight, each weighing about 8 percent of
the total crab weight. However, as the crab enlarges, its
large crushing claw grows more rapidly, eventually
constituting about 38 percent of the crab’s weight.
In 1932, Sir Julian Huxley described a simple
mathematical method for the detection and measure-
ment of the allometric growth. In order to compare the
relative growth of two components (one of which may
be the whole body), they are plotted logarithmically on
x- and y-axes:
log y = log b + k log x
The slope of the resulting regression is called the
allometric growth ratio, often designated as k.
k = 1, both components are growing at the same
rate.
k < 1, the component represented on the y-axis is
growing more slowly than the component on the x-
axis.
k > 1, the y-axis component is growing faster than
the x-axis component.
Another formula for measuring allometric growth is
Y=bxa, where Y is equal to the mass of the organ, x =
mass of the organism, a = growth coefficient of the
organ, and b = a constant.
Yet another formula for measuring allometric
growth is Y = bxa/c, where a and c are the growth rates
for two body parts.
Allometric growth studies have also been applied
to animal husbandry, archaeology, and urban systems
studies.
allometry
The study of relative growth and of
changes in proportion with increase in size.
allopatric speciation
One of two methods of specia-
tion (the other is sympatric), allopatric speciation hap-
pens when the ancestral population becomes segregated
by a geographical barrier. The Karner blue butterfly
(Lycaeides melissa samualis) became allopatric from its
parent the Melissa blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa
melissa) when the climate changed and restricted vari-
ous populations along its range to northeastern pine
barrens environments several thousand years ago. As
populations become isolated, the isolated gene pools
accumulate different genetic traits by microevolution.
Small populations are more likely to evolve into sepa-
rate species than larger isolated populations. Several
populations of the Karner blue butterfly are now sepa-
rated from each other by human-made development
and may be evolving into separate subspecies or
species, even though geographically they are isolated by
only a few miles in some cases.
Conditions that favor allopatric speciation are
when one population becomes isolated at the fringe of
the parent population’s range. This splinter population,
called a peripheral isolate, is likely to become allopatric
because the gene pool of the isolate may already be dif-
ferent, since living on the border of the range encour-
ages the expression of the extremes of any genotypic
CLINEs that existed in the original population. Further-
more, if the population is small enough, a FOUNDER
EFFECT will occur, giving rise to a gene pool that is not
that of the parent population.
Genetic drift will also occur until the peripheral
isolate becomes a larger population and will continue
to change the gene pool at random until the population
grows. New mutations or combinations of existing
alleles that are neutral in adaptive value now may
become fixed in the population by chance, causing
genotypic or phenotypic divergence from the parent
population. For example, the Karner blue butterfly has
a row of orange spots on the top of the hindwing,
whereas, the ancestral parent, the Melissa blue butter-
fly, has orange spots on the top of both front and hind-
wing, a phenotypic variation.
Another factor in causing allopatric speciation is
that evolution via natural selection may take a different
road in the peripheral population. The isolate will
allopatric speciation
11

encounter selection factors that are different from and
perhaps more severe than that experienced by the par-
ent because the isolate is living in an environment
slightly, or completely, different from that of the 
parent. These small isolated populations are not guar-
anteed to become new species, as they are more often
likely to become extinct, yet it is clear in evolutionary
history that allopatric speciation does occur.
See also SPECIATION.
allopolyploid
A type of polyploid (having a nucleus
that contains more than two sets of chromosomes)
species, often a plant, resulting from two different
species interbreeding and combining their chromo-
somes. Hybrids are often sterile because they do not
have sets of homologous chromosomes, making pair-
ing nonexistent unless two diploid hybrids double the
chromosome numbers, resulting in a fertile allote-
traploid that now contains two sets of homologous
chromosomes. Plant breeders find that this is 
beneficial, since it is possible to breed the advantages
of different species into one. Triticale (a “new” grain
created by crossing rye and durum wheat) is an
allopolyploid that was developed from wheat and rye.
Some crops are naturally allopolyploid, such as cotton,
oats, tall fescue, potatoes, wheat, and tobacco. It is
estimated that half of all angiosperms (flowering
plants) are polyploid.
allosteric binding sites
A type of binding site con-
tained in many ENZYMEs and RECEPTORs. As a conse-
quence of the binding to allosteric binding sites, the
interaction with the normal ligand (ligands are
molecules that bind to proteins) may be either
enhanced or reduced. Ligand binding can change the
shape of a protein.
allosteric effector
Specific small molecules that bind
to a protein at a site other than a catalytic site and that
modulate (by activation or INHIBITION) the biological
activity.
allosteric enzyme
An ENZYME
that contains a
region, separate from the region that binds the SUB-
STRATE for catalysis, where a small regulatory molecule
binds and affects that catalytic activity. This effector
molecule may be structurally unrelated to the substrate,
or it may be a second molecule of substrate. If the cat-
alytic activity is enhanced by binding, the effector is
called an activator; if it is diminished, the effector is
called an INHIBITOR.
allosteric regulation
The regulation of the activity
of allosteric ENZYMEs.
See also ALLOSTERIC BINDING SITES; ALLOSTERIC
ENZYME.
allosteric site
A specific receptor site on an enzyme
molecule not on the active site (the site on the surface
of an enzyme molecule that binds the substrate
molecule). Molecules bind to the allosteric site and
change the shape of the active site, either enabling the
substrate to bind to the active site or prevent the bind-
ing of the substrate.
The molecule that binds to the allosteric site is an
inhibitor because it causes a change in the three-dimen-
sional structure of the enzyme that prevents the sub-
strate from binding to the active site.
allozyme
An enzyme form, a variant of the same
enzyme (protein) that is coded for by different alleles at
a single locus.
See also ENZYME.
alpha helix
Most proteins contain one or more
stretches of amino acids that take on a particular shape
in three-dimensional space. The most common forms
are alpha helix and beta sheet.
Alpha helix is spiral shaped, constituting one form
of the secondary structure of proteins, arising from a
specific hydrogen-bonding structure; the carbonyl
group (–C=O) of each peptide bond extends parallel to
the axis of the helix and points directly at the –N–H
group of the peptide bond four amino acids below it in
the helix. A hydrogen bond forms between them
[–N–H . . . . . O=C–] and plays a role in stabilizing the
helix conformation. The alpha helix is right-handed
and twists clockwise, like a corkscrew, and makes a
12
allopolyploid

complete turn every 3.6 amino acids. The distance
between two turns is 0.54 nm. However, an alpha helix
can also be left-handed. Most enzymes contain sections
of alpha helix.
The alpha helix was discovered by Linus Pauling in
1948.
See also HELIX.
alternation of generations
A life cycle in plants
where there is both a multicellular diploid form (the
sporophyte generation) and a multicellular haploid
form (the gametophyte generation).
Gametophytes produce haploid gametes that fuse
zygotes that are forming. These zygotes then develop
into diploid sporophytes. Meiosis in the sporophytes
produces haploid spores, with division by meiosis giv-
ing rise to the next generation of gametophytes.
Alternation of generations occurs in plants and cer-
tain species of ALGAE. Ferns and fern allies (such as the
club moss) are common examples that display alterna-
tion of generations. The above ground parent fern
plant (the diploid sporophyte, or spore-bearing plant)
has two full sets of chromosomes (two of each kind of
chromosome). It sheds its single-celled haploid spores,
having one set of chromosomes (one of each kind),
which fall to the ground, and these in turn grow into a
different plant, the gametophyte or prothallus, also
haploid. The gametophyte has special bodies within the
plant called archegonia (female cells) and antheridia
(male cells). Here sexual fertilization takes place, and a
new diploid sporophyte then grows.
There are four main groups of plants considered to
be “fern allies,” a diverse group of vascular plants that
are neither flowering plants nor ferns and that repro-
duce by shedding spore to initiate an alternation of
generations. These are the Lycophyta (Lycopsida, the
club mosses; Selaginellopsida, the spike mosses; and
Isoëtopsida, 
the 
quillworts); 
the 
Archeophyta
(Sphenopsida, the horsetails and scouring-rushes;
Psilopsida, the whiskbrooms; and Ophioglossopsida,
the adder’s-tongues and grape-ferns); the Pteridophyta
(ferns); and Spermatophyta (flowering plants).
In some examples of alternation of generations—for
example, in certain algae species such as in some green
or brown forms—the alternation of generations takes
on two different approaches. Where the sporophytes
and gametophytes are structurally different, the two
generations are heteromorphic. If the sporophytes and
gametophytes look the same and have different chromo-
some pairs, the generations are said to be isomorphic.
altruistic behavior
The aiding of another individual
at one’s own risk or expense. This can be in the form of
one animal sending out a distress call to warn others of
impending trouble, although putting itself in danger by
giving out its location. Strangers coming to the rescue
of other strangers, such as victims in an accident, hurri-
cane, or earthquake, is another example of altruistic
behavior.
alveolus (plural, alveoli)
Latin for “hollow cavity.”
There are several definitions for alveolus. It is a thin,
multilobed air sac that exchanges gases in the lungs of
mammals and reptiles at the end of each bronchiole, a
very fine respiratory tube in the lungs. An alveolus is
lined with many blood capillaries where the exchange
of carbon dioxide and oxygen takes place.
It is also the name given to the socket in the jaw-
bone in which a tooth is rooted by means of the peri-
odontal 
membrane, 
the 
connective 
tissue 
that
surrounds the root and anchors it.
Furthermore, it is the term used to describe a single
hexagonal beehive cell found in a honeycomb. It is also
the term that refers to the milk-secreting sacs of the
mammary gland.

amino acid
An organic molecule possessing both
acidic carboxylic acid (–COOH) and basic amino
(–NH2) groups attached to the same tetrahedral carbon
atom.
Amino acids are the principal building blocks of
proteins and enzymes. They are incorporated into
amino acid
13

proteins by transfer RNA according to the genetic
code while messenger RNA is being decoded by ribo-
somes. The amino acid content dictates the spatial
and biochemical properties of the protein or enzyme
during and after the final assembly of a protein.
Amino acids have an average molecular weight of
about 135 daltons. While more than 50 have been dis-
covered, 20 are essential for making proteins, long
chains of bonded amino acids.
Some naturally occurring amino acids are alanine,
arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamine,
glutamic acid, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine,
lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine, thre-
onine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine.
The two classes of amino acids that exist are based
on whether the R-group is hydrophobic or hydrophilic.
Hydrophobic or nonpolar amino acids tend to repel the
aqueous environment and are located mostly in the
interior of proteins. They do not ionize or participate
in the formation of hydrogen bonds. On the other
hand, the hydrophilic or polar amino acids tend to
interact with the aqueous environment, are usually
involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds, and are
usually found on the exterior surfaces of proteins or in
their reactive centers. It is for this reason that certain
amino acid R-groups allow enzyme reactions to occur.
The hydrophilic amino acids can be further subdi-
vided into polar with no charge, polar with negatively
charged side chains (acidic), and polar with positively
charged side chains (basic).
While all amino acids share some structural similar-
ities, it is the side groups, or “R”-groups as they are
called, that make the various amino acids chemically
and physically different from each other so that they
react differently with the environment. These groupings,
found among the 20 naturally occurring amino acids,
are ionic (aspartic acid, arginine, glutamic acid, lysine,
and histidine), polar (asparagine, serine, threonine, cys-
teine, tyrosine, and glutamine), and nonpolar amino
acids (alanine, glycine, valine, leucine, isoleucine,
methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and proline).
Amino acids are also referred to as amphoteric,
meaning they can react with both acids and alkali,
which makes them effective buffers in biological sys-
tems. A buffer is a solution where the pH usually stays
constant when an acid or base is added.
In 1986 scientists found a 21st amino acid, seleno-
cysteine. In 2002 two teams of researchers from Ohio
State University identified the 22nd genetically encoded
amino acid, called pyrrolysine, a discovery that is the
biological equivalent of physicists finding a new funda-
mental particle or chemists discovering a new element.
Amino acid supplements are widely used in exer-
cise and dietary programs.
See also PROTEIN.
amino acid residue (in a polypeptide)
When two
or more amino acids combine to form a peptide, the
elements of water are removed, and what remains of
each amino acid is called amino acid residue. Amino
acid residues are therefore structures that lack a hydro-
gen atom of the amino group (–NH–CHR–COOH), 
or the hydroxy moiety of the carboxy group
(NH2–CHR–CO–), or both (–NH–CHR–CO–); all
units of a peptide chain are therefore amino acid
residues. (Residues of amino acids that contain two
amino groups or two carboxy groups may be joined by
isopeptide bonds, and so may not have the formulas

shown.) The residue in a peptide that has an amino
group that is free, or at least not acylated by another
amino acid residue (it may, for example, be acylated
or formylated), is called N-terminal; it is the N-
terminus. The residue that has a free carboxy group,
or at least does not acylate another amino acid 
residue (it may, for example, acylate ammonia to give
–NH–CHR–CO–NH2), is called C-terminal.
The following is a list of symbols for amino acids
(use of the one-letter symbols should be restricted to
the comparison of long sequences):
aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs)
When ribo-
somes pair a tRNA (transfer ribonucleic acid) with a
codon (three bases in a DNA or RNA sequence), an
amino acid is expected to be carried by the tRNA.
Since each tRNA is matched with its amino acid
before it meets the ribosome, the ribosome has no
way of knowing if the match was made. The match is
made by a family of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases. These enzymes charge each tRNA with
the proper amino acid via a covalent ester bond,
allowing each tRNA to make the proper translation
from the genetic code of DNA into the amino acid
code of proteins. Cells make at least 20 different
aminoacyl-tRNS synthetases, one for each of the
amino acids.
Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases belong to two
classes, depending on which amino acid they specify.
Class I enzymes usually are monomeric and attach to
the carobxyl of their specific amino acid to the 2’ OH
of adenosine 76 in the tRNA molecule. Class II
enzymes are either dimeric or tetrameric and attach
to their amino acids at the 3’ OH. These enzymes 
catalyze first by activating the amino acid by forming
an aminoacyl-adenylate. Here the carboxyl of the
amino acid is linked to the alpha-phosphate of ATP,
displacing pyrophosphate. After the corrected tRNA
is bound, the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-
adenylate is transferred to the 2’ or 3’ terminal OH
of the tRNA.
Recent studies have shown that aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetases can tell the difference between the right and
the wrong tRNA before they ever start catalysis, and if
the enzyme binds aminoacyl-adenylate first, it is even
more specific during tRNA binding. Previous studies
have also proved that aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases
reject wrong tRNAs during catalysis. Other research
has shown that specific aaRSs play roles in cellular
fidelity, tRNA processing, RNA splicing, RNA traffick-
ing, apoptosis, and transcriptional and translational
regulation. These new revelations may present new
evolutionary models for the development of cells and
perhaps opportunities for pharmaceutical advance-
ments.
amino group (–NH2)
A functional group (group of
atoms within a molecule that is responsible for certain
properties of the molecule and reactions in which it
takes part), common to all amino acids, that consists of
a nitrogen atom bonded covalently to two hydrogen
atoms, leaving a lone valence electron on the nitrogen
atom capable of bonding to another atom. It can act as
a base in solution by accepting a hydrogen ion and car-
rying a charge of +1. Any organic compound that has
an amino group is called an amine and is a derivative
of the inorganic compound ammonia, NH3. A primary
amine has one hydrogen atom replaced, such as in the
amino group. A secondary amine has two hydrogens
replaced. A tertiary amine has all three hydrogens
replaced. Amines are created by decomposing organic
matter.

amniocentesis
Amniocentesis is the removal of
about two tablespoons of amniotic fluid via a needle
inserted through the maternal abdomen into the uterus
and amniotic sac. This is done to gain information
about the condition, and even the sex, of the fetus. The
fluid contains cells from the fetus and placenta.
Some women have a greater chance of giving birth
to a baby with a chromosome problem, and amniocente-
sis can provide the answers if performed at about 16
weeks gestation (second trimester) or later. Chromosome
analysis and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) tests are two such
tests, and these check for chromosome abnormalities
such as Down’s syndrome and whether there are any
openings in the fetal skin, such as in the spine, that could
lead to neural-tube defects like spina bifida or anen-
cephaly, or inherited disorders such as cystic fibrosis.
While the procedure is relatively safe, some prob-
lems that can occur are miscarriage (1 in 200, or 0.5
percent chance), cramping, and infections (less than 1
in 1,000).
Amniocentesis can also be performed during the
second and third trimesters to determine fetal lung
maturity, to verify the health of the fetus in cases of Rh
sensitivity, and to identify any infections.
First used in 1882 to remove excess amniotic fluid,
it is often used in late pregnancy to test for anemia in
fetuses with Rh disease and to check if the fetal lungs
are advanced enough for delivery to occur.
amnion
The amnion is a thin, but tough, transparent
membranous sac and innermost of the four extra
embryonic membranes (allantois, yolk sac, chorion)
that encloses the embryo of reptiles, birds, and mam-
mals. These membranes hold the amniotic fluid and
form a protective layer for the fetus, insulating it from
bacteria and infection.
See also EMBRYO.
amniotes
Any of the vertebrates such as reptiles,
birds, and mammals that have an amnion surrounding
the embryo.
amniotic egg
A calcium based or leathery shelled
water-retaining egg that enables reptiles, birds, and
egg-laying mammals, such as the monotremes (duck-
billed platypus and two species of echidna, spiny
anteaters), to complete their life cycles on dry land.
amoebic dysentery
Dysentery caused by a proto-
zoan parasite (Entamoeba histolytica), mostly caused
by poor sanitary conditions and transmitted by con-
taminated food or water.
amphibian
Cold-blooded, or ectothermic, verte-
brates in the class Amphibia. These include the frogs
and toads (order Anura, or Salientia), salamanders and
newts (order Urodela, or Caudata), and the caecilians,
limbless amphibians (order Apoda, or Gymnophiona).
There are more than 11,000 species of amphibians, and
they are believed to be the first vertebrate species to live
on land.
Located between the fish and reptiles on the evolu-
tionary scale, they are the most primitive of the terres-
trial vertebrates and undergo a metamorphosis from
water-breathing limbless larva (tadpole) to land-loving,
or partly terrestrial, air-breathing four-legged adult.
Eggs are typically deposited in water or a wet pro-
tected place, although some do lay eggs in dry places.
The eggs are not shelled and do not possess the mem-
branes that are common in reptiles or higher verte-
brates. Adults have moist skins with no scales or small
scales, and they are specialized in living habitats. Each
has its own evolutionary adaptations from the jumping
ability (over 17 feet in some cases) of frogs and toads,
to the limbless caecilians, to the long tails of the sala-
manders and newts. For example, frogs can enter aesti-
vation, a period of dormancy similar to hibernation,
when experiencing long periods of heat or drought
conditions, and they can breathe through their skin in a
process called cutaneous gas exchange. The most poi-
sonous frog known, Phyllobates terribilis, only needs
0.00000007 ounce of skin secretion to kill a predator,
while an antibiotic secreted from the African clawed
frog (Xenopus laevis) may someday be used to treat
burns and cystic fibrosis.
Over the last 50 years, many species of amphibians
around the world have declined markedly in numbers;
some species have become extinct. In many instances,
these declines are attributable to adverse human influ-
ences acting locally, such as deforestation, draining of
wetlands, and pollution.
16
amniocentesis

However, in 1988, herpetologists (scientists who
study amphibians) from many parts of the world
reported declines in amphibian populations in protect-
ed, or pristine, habitats such as national parks and
nature reserves, where such local effects could not be
blamed. This suggested that there may be one or more
global factors that are affecting climatic and atmo-
spheric changes and adversely affecting amphibians,
such as increased UV-B radiation, widespread pollu-
tion, acid rain, and disease. In effect, the decline could
be the result of human-induced changes to the global
ecosystem and could have far-reaching consequences
for human survival.
amphipathic molecule
A molecule that has both a
hydrophilic (water soluble, polar) region and a
hydrophobic (water hating, nonpolar) region. The
hydrophilic part is called the head, while the hydropho-
bic part is called the tail. Lipids (phospholipids, choles-
terol and other sterols, glycolipids [lipids with sugars
attached], and sphingolipids) are examples of amphi-
pathic molecules.
Amphipathic molecules act as surfactants, materi-
als that can reduce the surface tension of a liquid at
low concentrations, and are used in wetting agents,
demisters, foaming agents, and emulsifiers.
anabolism
The processes of metabolism that result
in the synthesis of cellular components from precursors
of low molecular weight.
See also METABOLISM.
anaerobic
Any organism or environmental or 
cellular process that does not require the use of free
oxygen. Certain bacteria such as Actinomyces israeli,
Bacteroides 
fragilis, 
Prevotella 
melaninogenica,
Clostridium difficile,
and Peptostreptococcus
are
anaerobes.
In effect, an anaerobic organism does not need
oxygen for growth. Many anaerobes are even sensi-
tive to oxygen. Obligate (strict) anaerobes grow 
only in the absence of oxygen. Facultative anaerobes
can grow either in the presence or in the absence of
oxygen.
See also AEROBIC.
anagenesis
A pattern of evolutionary change along a
single, unbranching lineage involving the transformation
of an entire population, sometimes so different from the
ancestral population that it can be called a separate
species. Examples would be one taxon replacing another
or the transformation of a single ancestral species into a
single descendant species. Anagenesis is also known as
phyletic evolution and is the opposite of CLADOGENESIS.
In medicine, it refers to the regeneration of tissue
or structure.
analog
A DRUG whose structure is related to that of
another drug but whose chemical and biological prop-
erties may be quite different.
See also CONGENER.
analogy
The similarity of structure between two
species that are not closely related; usually attributed to
convergent evolution. Structures that resemble each
other due to a similarity in function without any simi-
analogy

larity in underlying structure (or origin) are called anal-
ogous structures. For example, birds and bats each
have their forelimbs modified as wings. They are analo-
gous because they evolved independently after the earli-
est birds and bats diverged from their common
ancestor, who did not have wings. However, the details
of their structures are quite different.
anation
Replacement of the LIGAND water by an
anion in a COORDINATION entity.
androgens
Steroid sex hormones, such as testos-
terone secreted by the testes in males, and others secret-
ed by the adrenal cortex in humans and higher animals,
as well as by the adrenal glands and ovaries in mam-
mals. Androgens stimulate the development and main-
tenance of the male reproductive system such as sperm
production, sexual behavior, and muscle development.
Secondary sex characteristics such as the growth of
pubic hair in females is also a product of androgens, as
is the deepening of the voice at puberty.
Testosterone is present in a number of forms, such
as free testosterone, as testosterone bound to a protein,
sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), and as dihy-
drotestosterone. Testosterone and synthetic androgens
(anabolic steroids) have been used for infertility, athletic
enhancement, erectile dysfunction, and libido problems,
but their use can cause side effects such as muscle weak-
ness, muscle atrophy, little facial and body hair, and even
changes in the size of the genitalia. Prolonged use can
damage the liver, and their use is banned in many sports.
Other androgens are androsterone (excreted in
urine), which reinforces masculine characteristics; dihy-
drotestosterone, which is a metabolite synthesized
mainly in the liver from free testosterone by the enzyme
5-alpha-reductase and which levels are proportionally
correlated to sex drive as well as erectile capabilities;
and dehydroepiandrosterone, which are adrenal andro-
gens that have been linked to puberty and aging.
See also HORMONE.
androgynous
Term applied to flowering plants that
have both staminate and pistillate flowers, or to cryp-
tograms (ferns, mosses, fungi, algae) where the
antheridia and archegonia are together.
anemia
Condition in which there is a reduction in
the number of red blood cells or amount of
HEMOGLOBIN per unit volume of blood below the refer-
ence interval for a similar individual of the species
under consideration, often causing pallor and fatigue.
See also HEMOGLOBIN.
aneuploidy
Aneuploidy is the gain or loss of individ-
ual chromosomes from the normal diploid set of 46
and is the most common cytogenetic abnormality
caused when homologous chromosomes fail to separate
during the first division of meiosis.
When a loss of a chromosome occurs, it is called
monosomy and is rarely seen in live births, since most
monosomic embryos and fetuses are lost to sponta-
neous abortion at very early stages of pregnancy. One
exception to this is the loss of an X chromosome,
which produces Turner syndrome in about one out of
every 5,000 female births.
The more common gain of a single chromosome is
called trisomy and has been associated with various
cancers. A common autosomal trisomy is Down’s syn-
drome in humans.
Another form of aneuploidy is called nullisomy,
which is the loss of both pairs of homologous chromo-
somes and is almost always fatal to humans, since
humans have no extra disposable chromosomes in the
genome.
Tetrasomy is the gain of an extra pair of homolo-
gous chromosomes and is a rare chromosomal aberra-
tion. It can cause metopic craniosynostosis, facial
anomalies, cranial asymmetry, atrioseptal defects,
hydronephrosis, flexion contractures of the lower limbs,
sensorineural hearing loss, and mental retardation.
angiosperm A flowering plant. There are close to
250,000 species of flowering plants, second in abun-
dance only to insects. All have three basic organs
(roots, stems, and leaves) and represent the most abun-
dant and advanced terrestrial plants, which include
trees, herbaceous plants, herbs, shrubs, all grasses, and
some aquatic plants. Angiosperms are the source of
most of the food on which human beings and other
mammals rely and of many raw materials and natural
products that provide the infrastructure for modern
civilizations.
18
anation

Angiosperms are divided into two large groups.
The dicotyledonea, or dicotyledons (also called magno-
liopsida), the larger of the two groups, includes trees
and shrubs and herbaceous plants. Dicots have two
seed leaves (cotyledons) in the embryo. The smaller of
the two groups is the monocotyledoneae, or mono-
cotyledons (also called liliopsida), that include rice,
corn, palms, bananas, coconuts, grasses, lilies, orchids,
and garden plants. Monocots have a single seed leaf in
the embryo.
The life cycles of the angiosperms have several
advantages over those of conifers, or gymnosperms,
the only other group of seed-bearing plants, and from
which scientists believe the angiosperms evolved 
during the Cretaceous era some 145 million years
ago. They reproduce via flowers instead of cones;
their ovules are embedded in female sporophylls
instead of being exposed on a bare ground surface
(e.g., apple); the gametophyte is reduced; and seeds
are enclosed in fruits that develop from the ovary or
related structures.
Angiosperms have a true flower that is either a
highly modified shoot with modified stem and leaves or
a condensed and reduced compound strobilus (conelike
structure) or inflorescence (flower cluster). Floral parts
are in the form of sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels,
while the ovules—the structure that develops in the
plant ovary and contains the female gametophyte—are
contained within the megasporophylls that are sealed
in most angiosperm families. Pollination is facilitated
by wind, water, or many animals. Self-pollination as
well as parthenogenesis, a process by which embryonic
development is initiated directly from an unfertilized
cell, are common. Double fertilization occurs in all
members of the phylum to produce the unusual stored
food tissue called endosperm. Sexual reproduction 
in flowering plants occurs by this process of double 
fertilization in which one fertilization event forms an
angiosperm

embryo, and a second fertilization event produces
endosperm, a polyploid embryo-nourishing tissue
found only in the angiosperms. Seeds are dispersed
through a variety of forms such as fruits, follicles, cap-
sules, berries, drupes, samaras, nuts, and achenes.
Angiosperm is a combination of the Latin word angi-
(enclosed) and the Greek word sperma (seed).
anion
An atom or molecule that has a negative
charge; a negatively charged ion.
See also ION.
anisotropy
The property of molecules and materials
to exhibit variations in physical properties along differ-
ent molecular axes of the substance.
annual
A plant that completes its entire life cycle—
germinates, grows, flowers, and seeds—in a single year
or growing season.
See also BIENNIAL; PERENNIAL.
antagonist
A DRUG or a compound that opposes
the physiological effects of another. At the RECEPTOR
level, it is a chemical entity that opposes the RECEPTOR-
associated responses normally induced by another
bioactive agent.
anterior
Referring to the head end of a bilaterally
symmetrical animal; the front of an animal.
anther
In angiosperms, it is the terminal pollen sac of
the stamen. The pollen grains with male gametes form
inside the anther. It is the pollen that fertilizes the
ovules. The anther is the primary male reproductive
structure at the apex of the flower’s stamen, the male
sexual organ.
See also STAMEN.
antheridium
The multicellular male sex organ or
gametangium where motile male gametes (sperm) are
formed and protected in algae, fungi, bryophytes
(mosses, liverworts, etc.), and pteridophytes (ferns).
anthrax
Bacterial disease of animals and humans
caused by contamination with spores from Bacillus
anthracis through inhalation or skin entry (cutaneous);
can be used as an agent of bioterrorism.
See also BACTERIA.
anti
In the representation of STEREOCHEMICAL rela-
tionships, anti means “on opposite sides” of a refer-
ence plane, in contrast to syn, which means “on the
same side.”
antibiotic
A chemical agent that is produced synthet-
ically or by an organism that is harmful to another
organism. It is used to combat disease, either topically
or by ingestion, in humans, animals, and plants. It can
be made from a mold or bacterium and kills or slows
the growth of other microbes, in particular bacteria.
Penicillin, one of the most famous antibiotics, was acci-
dentally discovered by the British bacteriologist SIR
ALEXANDER FLEMING in 1928.
Antibiotic resistance can occur when antibiotics are
used repetitively. While most of the targeted bacteria
are killed by a dose of antibiotics, some escape death,
and these remaining bacteria have or develop a genetic
resistance to the antibiotic. Unfortunately, this resis-
tance trait can be passed on to their offspring.

in the bone marrow (also known as B lymphocytes,
plasma cells) in response to an antigen (a foreign sub-
stance). Antibodies are produced in response to disease
and help the body fight against a particular disease by
binding to the antigen and killing it, or making it more
vulnerable to action by white blood cells. They help the
body develop an immunity to diseases.
Each antibody has two light (L) and two heavy (H)
immunoglobulin polypeptide chains linked together by
disulfide bonds, with two antigen-binding sites. There
are more than 1,000 possible variations, yet each anti-
body recognizes only one specific antigen. Antibodies
are normally bound to a B cell, but when an antibody
encounters an antigen, the B cell produces copies of the
antibody with the assistance of helper T cells (a lym-
phocyte that undergoes a developmental stage in the
thymus). The released antibodies then go after and
bind to the antigen, either killing it or marking it for
destruction by phagocytes.
There are five immunoglobulins: IgC, IgA, IgM,
IgD, and IgE.
IgA, or immunoglobulin A, comprises about 10–15
percent of the body’s total immunoglobulins and is
found in external secretions such as saliva, tears, breast
milk, and mucous, both intestinal and bronchial. They
are secreted on the surface of the body as a first defense
against bacteria and viral antigens in an attempt to pre-
vent them from entering the body.
IgM or immunoglobulin M antibodies are pro-
duced in response to new or repeat infections and stay
in the body for a short time after infection. They make
up from 5 to 10 percent of the total immunoglobulins
and are the first to show up in the serum after an anti-
gen enters. IgM is produced during the primary
immune response. It is the IgMs that capture and bind
antigens to form large insoluble complexes that are
cleared from the blood.
IgG or immunoglobulin G (gamma globulin) anti-
bodies remain in the body for long periods of time after
infection and are the most common type, comprising
about 80 percent of the body’s total immunoglobulins.
They are in the serum and are produced in substantial
quantities during the secondary immune response, and
along with IgM activate the complement system, which
results in the destruction of the membrane of
pathogens. The IgGs act by agglutinating, by opsonis-
ing, by activating complement-mediated reactions
against cellular pathogens, and by neutralizing toxins.
IgE or immunoglobulin E is associated with mast
cells, which are basophils, a type of granular white
blood cell that has left the bloodstream and entered a
tissue. Mast cells release histamine and heparin, chemi-
cals that mediate allergic reactions. Not surprisingly,
IgE is responsible for immediate hypersensitivity (aller-
gic) reactions and immune defense against parasites.
IgD or immunoglobulin D is a specialized immuno-
globulin, but its function is currently unknown. It is
found in small amounts in the serum.

anticodon
A specialized sequence of three nucleotides
on a tRNA (transfer ribonucleic acid) molecule. The
anticodon associates with a complementary triplet of
bases—the codon—on an mRNA (messenger RNA)
molecule during protein synthesis.
The tRNA molecule acts like a “ferry” whose job
is to “pick up a passenger” (read the code from the
mRNA) and then “shuttle it” (dock to the correspond-
ing amino acid) into place. The other end of the tRNA
molecule has an acceptor site where the tRNA’s specific
amino acid will bind.
The 20 amino acids in the table below can create
64 different tRNA molecules, 61 for tRNA coding
and three codes for chain termination (pairing up with
“stop codons” that end the mRNA message), and
each amino acid can create more than one set of
codons.
See also CODON.
antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
Also known as vaso-
pressin, ADH is a nine–amino acid peptide secreted from
the posterior pituitary gland. The hormone is packaged
in secretory vesicles with a carrier protein called neuro-
physin within hypothalamic neurons, and both are
released upon hormone secretion. The single most impor-
tant effect of antidiuretic hormone is to conserve body
water by reducing the output of urine. It binds to recep-
tors in the distal or collecting tubules of the kidney and
promotes reabsorption of water back into the circulation.
The release of ADH is based on plasma osmolarity,
the concentration of solutes in the blood. For example,
loss of water (e.g., sweating) results in a concentration
of blood solutes, so plasma osmolarity increases.
Osmoreceptors, neurons in the hypothalamus, stimu-
late secretion from the neurons that produce ADH. If
the plasma osmolarity falls below a certain threshold,
the osmoreceptors do nothing and no ADH is released.
However, when osmolarity increases above the thresh-
old, the osmoreceptors stimulate the neurons and ADH
is released.
antiferromagnetic

occurring metabolic pathway that acts by replacing the
natural substrate, thus blocking or diverting the
biosynthesis of physiologically important substances.

apical dominance
Concentration of growth at the
tip of a plant shoot, where a terminal bud partially
inhibits axillary bud growth. It is thought to be caused
by the apical bud producing a great deal of IAA (auxin),
which is transported from the apical bud to the sur-
rounding area and causes lateral buds to stay dormant.
apical meristem
Embryonic plant tissue (meristem-
atic cells) in the tips of roots and in the buds of shoots
that supplies cells via mitosis for the plant to grow in
length.
apomixis
The ability of certain plants to reproduce
clones of themselves, i.e., the scaly male fern group,
Dryopteris affinis (Lowe) Fraser-Jenkins.
apomorphic character
A phenotypic character, or
homology, in which the similarity of characters found
in different species is the result of common descent,
i.e., the species evolved after a branch diverged from a
phylogenetic tree.
Two characters in two taxa are homologues if they
are the same as the character that is found in the ances-
try of the two taxa or they are different characters that
have an ancestor/descendant relationship described as
preexisting or novel. The ancestral character is termed
the plesiomorphic character, and the descendant char-
acter is termed the apomorphic character. Examples are
the flippers of whales and human arms.

apoplast
The cell-wall continuum of an organ or a
plant; in a plant it includes the xylem. The movement
of substances via cell walls is called apoplastic trans-
port.

ples. The warning coloration alerts the predator, who
may have eaten a similar-looking animal and was sick-

mimic others in appearance, such as the viceroy butter-
fly and the monarch butterfly.

aquaporins (AQPs)
The aquaporins are a family of
proteins known for facilitating water transport. An
aquaporin is a transport protein in the plasma mem-
branes of a plant or animal cell that specifically facili-
tates the diffusion of water across the membrane
(osmosis).
Aquaporin-1, or CHIP-28, discovered in 1992 by
Peter Agre, is the major water channel of the red blood
cells. In the kidneys, it is involved in the reabsorption of
most of the waste filtered through the glomeruli. It is
also thought to influence the movement of CO2 across
the cell membrane, since it is present in most cells that
have high levels of CO2. Aquaporin-2, or WCH-CD, is a
water channel that makes the principal cells of the
medullary collecting duct in the kidneys more permeable
to water. Lack of a functional aquaporin-2 gene leads to
a rare form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. There are
many more aquaporins that have been discovered in the
more water-permeable parts of the body, such as the
moist surface tissues of the alveoli in the lung, the kidney
tubules, the choroid plexus of the brain where cere-
brospinal fluid is produced, the ciliary epithelium of the
eye where aqueous humor is formed, and the salivary
and lacrimal tear glands. Aquaporins are believed to be
involved in mechanisms defending against brain edema,
congestive heart failure, and many other clinical entities.
aquation
The incorporation of one or more integral
molecules of water into another chemical species with or
without displacement of one or more atoms or groups.
See also HYDRATION.
aqueous solution
A solution in which water is the
solvent or dissolving medium, such as salt water, rain,
or soda.
Archaea
One of two prokaryotic (no nucleus)
domains, the other being the Bacteria. Archaeans
include organisms that live in some of the most
extreme environments on the planet and resemble
bacteria. They are single-cell organisms that, with
bacteria, are called prokaryotes. Their DNA is not
enclosed in a nucleus. Bacteria and archaea are the
only prokaryotes; all other life forms are eukaryotes.
Archaeans are among the earliest forms of life that
appeared on Earth billions of years ago, and it is
believed that the archaea and bacteria developed 
separately from a common ancestor nearly 4 billion
years ago.
Some archaeans are “extremophiles,” that is,
they live near rift vents in the deep sea at tempera-
tures well over 100°C (212°F). Others live in hot
springs (such as the hot springs of Yellowstone
National Park, where some of archaea were first dis-
covered) or in extremely alkaline or acid waters.
They have been found inside the digestive tracts of
cows, termites, and marine life, where they produce
methane. They also live in the anoxic muds of marsh-
es and at the bottom of the ocean and in petroleum
deposits deep underground. They are also quite abun-
dant in the plankton of the open sea and even have
been found in the Antarctic. They survive in these
harsh conditions by using a variety of protective
molecules and enzymes.
Three groups of archaeans are known and include
the Crenarchaeota, those that are extremophiles; the
Euryarchaeota, methane producers and salt lovers; and
the Korarchaeota, an all-inclusive group that contains a
number of types that are little understood today.
Archaeans produce energy by feeding on hydrogen
gas, carbon dioxide, and sulfur and can even create
energy from the sun by using a pigment around the
membrane called a bacteriorhodopsin that reacts with
light and produces ATP.
The archaeans were not discovered as a separate
group until the late 1970s.
archaezoa
This group is believed to be the first to
diverge from the prokaryotes. They lack mitochondria
(converts foods into usable energy), though some
archaezoans have genes for mitochondrial. They also
lack an endoplasmic reticulum (important for protein
synthesis) and golgi apparatus (important for glycosy-
archaezoa
25

lation, secretion), have no peroxisomes (use oxygen to
carry out catabolic reactions), and have small ribo-
somes similar to bacteria.
Archaezoa has three known subgroups: diplomon-
ads, microspoidians, and trichomonads. They are usu-
ally found with flagellas in moist/damp environments
such as streams, lakes, underground water deposits,
and in damp soil.
Some members have been found in harsh environ-
ments and can exist in bodies of water that can drop
below –20° Fahrenheit and around ocean floor vents
that exceed 320°F. These organisms can survive in a
variety of environments as long as they are in water.
Many archaezoans are parasites and feed off their
host. The species Giardia, which causes abdominal
cramps and severe diarrhea, uses a ventral suction cup
to attach to the human intestinal epithelium. Some
species have chloroplasts that allow them to take in
light energy and use it when needed. Some species con-
tain hydrogenosomes, organelles that are similar to
mitochondria but do not respire with oxygen. They
convert pyruvate into acetate, CO2, and H2, allowing
extra ATP synthesis without respiration.
Since they have no mitochondria or plastid, it is
believed that they are the intermediate stage between
prokaryotes and eukaryotes and are also used as evi-
dence for the evolution of the nucleus before the
organelles.
archegonium
In plants, the multicellular flask-
shaped female gametangium (a moist chamber in which
gametes develop in bryophytes, ferns, and gym-
nosperms).
archenteron
The endoderm-lined gut (enteron) hol-
low cavity formed during the gastrulation process in
metazoan embryos. The archenteron is formed by the
infolding of part of the outer surface of the BLASTULA
and opening to the exterior via the BLASTOPORE. Also
called the primitive gut, or gastrocoel in early embryon-
ic development, it is the digestive cavity. The term is
Greek for “primitive intestine.”
archipelago
A group or chain of islands clustered in
a body of water, e.g., the African Bazaruto Archipela-
go, consisting of five islands: Bazaruto, Magaruque,
Santa Carolina, Benguera (Benguerra), and Bangue.
Aristotle (384 B.C.E.–322 B.C.E.) Greek Philosopher
Aristotle, a Greek philosopher and scientist, has 
had more influence on the field of science than any-
one. His influence, which lasted more than 2,000
years, was due to the fact that he was the first to
depart from the old Platonic school of thinking by
reasoning that accurate observation, description,
inductive reasoning, and interpretation was the way
to understand the natural world. Since he was the
first to use this method, he is often called the “Father
of Natural History.”
Born in 384 B.C.E. in the Ionian colony of Stagirus
(now Macedonia), Aristotle was the son of Nico-
machus, a physician and grandfather of Alexander the
Great. At 17, he became a student in Plato’s academy
in Athens and stayed there for more than 20 years as a
student and teacher. In 347 B.C.E., he moved to the
princedom of Atarneus in Mysia (northwestern Asia
Minor), ruled by Hermias, and who presided over a
small circle of Plato followers in the town of Assos.
Aristotle befriended Hermias, joined the group, and
eventually married Hermias’s niece and adopted daugh-
ter Pythias.
Around 342 B.C.E., he moved to Mieza, near the
Macedonian capital Pella, to supervise the education
of 13-year-old Alexander the Great. Aristotle returned
to Athens in 335 B.C.E. to teach, promote research
projects, and organize a library in the Lyceum. His
school was known as the Peripatetic School. After
Alexander’s death in 323 B.C.E., Aristotle was prose-
cuted and had to leave Athens, leaving his school to
Theophrastus. He died shortly after at Chalcis in
Euboea in 322 B.C.E.
While his writings were immense, one of his works
particularly influenced the field of meteorology for
over 2,000 years. Meteorologica (meteorology) was
written in 350 B.C.E. and comprised four books,
although there are doubts about the authenticity of the
last one. They deal mainly with atmospheric phenome-
na, oceans, meteors and comets, and the fields of
astronomy, chemistry, and geography.
Aristotle attempted to explain the atmosphere
in a philosophical way and discussed all forms of
“meteors,” a term then used to explain anything sus-
26
archegonium

pended in the atmosphere. Aristotle discussed the
philosophical nature of clouds and mist, snow, rain
and hail, wind, lightning and thunder, rivers, rain-
bows, and climatic changes. His ideas posited the
existence of four elements (earth, wind, fire, and
water), each arranged in separate layers but capable
of mingling.
Aristotle’s observations in the biological sciences
had some validity, but many of his observations and
conclusions regarding weather and climate were
wrong, and it was not until the 17th century—with the
invention of meteorological instruments such as the
hygrometer, thermometer, and barometer—that his
ideas were disproved scientifically. However, he cor-
rectly reasoned that the earth was a sphere, recorded
information regarding the bathymetry of seas, correctly
interpreted dolphins and whales as mammals, separat-
ed vertebrates into oviparous and viviparous, and
described and named many organisms, including crus-
taceans and worms, mollusks, echinoderms, and fish
from the Aegean Sea.
Arrhenius, 
Svante 
August (1859–1927) Swedish
Chemist, Physicist
Svante August Arrhenius was born
in Vik (or Wijk), near Uppsala, Sweden, on February
19, 1859. He was the second son of Svante Gustav
Arrhenius and Carolina Christina (née Thunberg).
Svante’s father was a surveyor and an administrator of
his family’s estate at Vik. In 1860, a year after Arrhe-
nius was born, his family moved to Uppsala, where his
father became a supervisor at the university. He was
reading by the age of three.
Arrhenius received his early education at the
cathedral school in Uppsala, excelling in biology,
physics, and mathematics. In 1876, he entered the
University of Uppsala and studied physics, chemistry,
and mathematics, receiving his B.S. two years later.
While he continued graduate classes for three years in
physics at Uppsala, his studies were not completed
there. Instead, Arrhenius transferred to the Swedish
Academy of Sciences in Stockholm in 1881 to work
under Erick Edlund to conduct research in the field of
electrical theory.
Arrhenius studied electrical conductivity of dilute
solutions by passing electric current through a variety
of solutions. His research determined that molecules
in some of the substances split apart, or dissociated
from each other, into two or more ions when they
were dissolved in a liquid. He found that while each
intact molecule was electrically balanced, the split
particles carried a small positive or negative electrical
charge when dissolved in water. The charged atoms
permitted the passage of electricity, and the electrical
current directed the active components toward the
electrodes. His thesis on the theory of ionic dissocia-
tion was barely accepted by the University of Uppsala
in 1884, since the faculty believed that oppositely
charged particles could not coexist in solution. He
received a grade that prohibited him from being able
to teach.
Arrhenius published his theories (“Investigations
on the Galvanic Conductivity of Electrolytes”) and
sent copies of his thesis to a number of leading Euro-
pean scientists. Russian-German chemist Wilhelm Ost-
wald, one of the leading European scientists of the day
and one of the principal founders of physical chem-
istry, was impressed and visited him in Uppsala, offer-
ing him a teaching position, which he declined.
However, Ostwald’s support was enough for Uppsala
to give him a lecturing position, which he kept for two
years.
The Stockholm Academy of Sciences awarded
Arrhenius a traveling scholarship in 1886. As a result,
he worked with Ostwald in Riga with physicist
Friedrich Kohlrausch at the University of Wurzburg,
with physicist Ludwig Boltzmann at the University of
Graz, and with chemist Jacobus Van’t Hoff at the Uni-
versity of Amsterdam. In 1889, he formulated his rate
equation that is used for many chemical transforma-
tions and processes, in which the rate is exponentially
related to temperature, known as the “Arrhenius
equation.”
He returned to Stockholm in 1891 and became a
lecturer in physics at Stockholm’s Hogskola (high
school) and was appointed physics professor in 1895
and rector in 1897. Arrhenius married Sofia Rudbeck
in 1894 and had one son. The marriage lasted a short
two years. Arrhenius continued his work on elec-
trolytic dissociation and added the study of osmotic
pressure.
In 1896, he made the first quantitative link
between changes in carbon dioxide concentration and
climate. He calculated the absorption coefficients of
carbon dioxide and water based on the emission spec-
trum of the moon, and he also calculated the amount
Arrhenius, Svante August
27

of total heat absorption and corresponding tempera-
ture change in the atmosphere for various concentra-
tions of carbon dioxide. His prediction of a doubling of
carbon dioxide from a temperate rise of 5–6°C is close
to modern predictions. He predicted that increasing
reliance on fossil fuel combustion to drive the world’s
increasing industrialization would, in the end, lead to
increases in the concentration of CO2 in the atmo-
sphere, thereby giving rise to a warming of the Earth.
In 1900, he published his Textbook of Theoretical
Electrochemistry. In 1901 he and others confirmed the
Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell’s hypothesis that
cosmic radiation exerts pressure on particles. Arrhenius
went on to use this phenomenon in an effort to explain
the aurora borealis and solar corona. He supported the
Norwegian physicist Kristian Birkeland’s explanation of
the origin of auroras that he proposed in 1896. He also
suggested that radiation pressure could carry spores and
other living seeds through space and believed that life on
earth was brought here under those conditions. He like-
wise believed that spores might have populated many
other planets, resulting in life throughout the universe.
In 1902, he received the Davy Medal of the Royal
Society and proposed a theory of immunology. The fol-
lowing year he was awarded the Nobel Prize for chem-
istry for his work that originally had been perceived as
improbable by his Uppsala professors. He also pub-
lished his Textbook of Cosmic Physics.
He became director of the Nobel Institute of Physi-
cal Chemistry in Stockholm in 1905 (a post he held
until a few months before his death). He married
Maria Johansson and had one son and two daughters.
The following year he also had time to publish three
books, Theories of Chemistry, Immunochemistry, and
Worlds in the Making.
He was elected a foreign member of the Royal
Society in 1911, the same year he received the Willard
Gibbs Medal of the American Chemical Society. Three
years later he was awarded the Faraday Medal of the
British Chemical Society. He was also a member of the
Swedish Academy of Sciences and the German Chemi-
cal Society.
During the latter part of his life his interests includ-
ed the chemistry of living matter and astrophysics, espe-
cially the origins and fate of stars and planets. He
continued to write books such as Smallpox and Its Com-
bating (1913), Destiny of the Stars (1915), Quantitative
Laws in Biological Chemistry (1915), and Chemistry
and Modern Life (1919). He also received honorary
degrees from the universities of Birmingham, Edinburgh,
Heidelberg, and Leipzig and from Oxford and Cam-
bridge Universities. He died in Stockholm on October 2,
1927, after a brief illness, and is buried at Uppsala.
arteriosclerosis
Also known as “hardening of the
arteries.” It is a disease whereby the arteries thicken and
the inner surfaces accumulate deposits of hard plaques
of cholesterol, calcium, fibrin, and other cellular debris.
The arteries become inelastic and narrowed, which
increases the stress on the heart as it pumps blood
through, and complete obstruction with loss of blood
supply can occur. This is a common cause for high
blood pressure. There are hereditary links that are asso-
ciated with increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
When arteriosclerosis occurs in large arteries, such as
the aorta, it is often referred to as atherosclerosis.
See also ARTERY.
artery
A
blood vessel that carries oxygenated
(except the pulmonary artery) blood away from the
heart via the right and left ventricles to organs
throughout the body. The main trunk of the arterial
system in the body is called the aorta. The aortic divi-
sions are the abdominal aorta, thoracic aorta, aortic
artery, and ascending aorta. The pulmonary artery
carries unoxygenated blood from the heart to the
lungs for oxygenation.
See also VEIN.
arthritis
Inflammation of one or more of the joints in
the body.
Arthropoda
An animal phylum where individuals
have a segmented body, exoskeleton, and jointed legs.
artificial selection
Artificial selection is the con-
scious attempt by human beings to alter the environ-
ments or traits of other organisms (including their own
environment) so as to alter the evolution of these
28
arteriosclerosis

organism’s species. It is used in the selective breeding of
domesticated plants and animals to encourage the
occurrence of desirable traits or new breeds. Chickens
are artificially selected to produce better eggs, and pet
fish are selectively bred to produce vibrant colors and
other desirable traits.
ascus (plural, asci)
In Ascomycota (blue, green, and
red molds), a saclike spore capsule located at the tip of
the fruiting body, called the ascocarp in dikaryotic
(containing two differing haploid nuclei) hyphae, in
which ascopores are found and in which karyogamy is
performed, i.e., two (dikaryotic) nuclei fuse (karyo-
gamy) to form diploid nuclei. Asci vary in shape from
narrow and elongate to nearly round. While the num-
ber of ascospores per ascus is usually eight, numerous
other counts of ascospores per ascus are also known.
In medicine ASCUS stands for atypical squamous
cells of undetermined significance and means that irreg-
ular cells have shown up on a Pap smear.
asexual reproduction
A type of reproduction, with-
out meiosis or syngamy (the fusion of two gametes in
fertilization), involving only one parent that produces
genetically identical offspring by budding, by the divi-
sion of a single cell, or by the entire organism breaking
into two or more parts. The offspring has the identical
genes and chromosomes as the parent. Most plants are
capable of asexual reproduction by means of special-
ized organs called propagules, such as tubers, stolons,
gemma cups, and rhizomes.
Asexual reproduction is also known as vegetative
reproduction. Examples of organisms that reproduce
by asexual reproduction include aspens, dandelions,
strawberries, walking fern (Asplenium rhizophyllum),
and yeast. While asexual reproduction guarantees
reproduction (no dependence on others), it does not
allow genetic variation.
See also SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.

standing figure. The heart and kidneys are also shown. Note the
feathery network of blood vessels in the left and right lungs (next
to the heart). Arteries are the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich
blood to the body’s tissues. Veins (not shown) carry blood back to
the heart. The average adult has about five liters of blood. At rest,
this volume of blood passes through the heart each minute.

assimilation
To transform food and other nutrients
into a part of the living organism.
assimilative
See ASSIMILATION.
assimilator
See ASSIMILATION.
associative learning
The acquired ability to associ-
ate one stimulus with another, such as one linked to a
reward or punishment; also called classical condition-
ing and trial-and-error learning.
assortative mating
A type of nonrandom or prefer-
ence mating in which mating partners resemble each
other in certain phenotypic characteristics. It can be a
preference or avoidance of certain individuals as mates
based on physical or social traits.
astigmatism
Distorted vision, especially at close dis-
tances, resulting from an irregularly shaped cornea.
asymmetric carbon
A
carbon atom covalently
bonded to four different atoms or groups of atoms.
asymmetric synthesis
A traditional term for stereo-
selective synthesis. A chemical reaction or reaction
sequence in which one or more new elements of CHI-
RALITY are formed in a SUBSTRATE molecule and which
produces the 
STEREOISOMERic (ENANTIOMERic or
DIASTEREOISOMERic) products in unequal amounts.
asymmetry parameter
In nuclear quadrupole reso-
nance spectroscopy, the parameter, η, is used for
describing nonsymmetric fields. It is defined as η =
(qxx – qyy)/qzz in which qxx, qyy, and qzz are the
components of the field gradient q (which is the second
derivative of the time-averaged electric potential) along
the x– , y– and z–axes. By convention qzz refers to the
largest field gradient, qyy to the next largest, and qxx
to the smallest when all three values are different.
atomic number
The atomic number is equal to the
number of positively charged protons in an atom’s
nucleus and determines which element an atom is.
The atomic number is unique for each element and is
designated by a subscript to the left of the elemental
symbol. The atomic number for hydrogen is 1; it has
one proton. Elements are substances made up of
atoms with the same atomic number. Most of the 
elements are metals (75 percent) and the others are
nonmetals.
atomic weight or mass
The total atomic mass (the
weighted average of the naturally occurring isotopes),
which is the mass in grams of one MOLE of the atom.
The atomic weight is calculated by adding the number
of protons and neutrons together. The atomic weight of
hydrogen is 1.0079 grams per mole.
ATP (adenosine triphosphate)
An adenine (purine
base), ribose, and three phosphate units containing
nucleoside triphosphate that (a) releases free energy
when its phosphate bonds are hydrolyzed and (b) pro-
duces adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and inorganic
phosphorous. This energy is used to drive ENDER-
GONIC
REACTIONS in cells (chemical reactions that
require energy input to begin). ATP is produced in the
cristae of mitochondria and chloroplasts in plants and
is the driving force in muscle contraction and protein
synthesis in animals. It is the major energy source
within cells.
ATP synthase (proton translocating ATPase)
A
protein complex (a chemiosmotic enzyme) that syn-
thesizes adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from adeno-
sine diphosphate (ADP) and enables phosphate
coupling with an electrochemical ion gradient across
the membrane. It is found in cellular membranes and
the inner membrane of mitochondria, the thylakoid
membrane of chloroplasts, and the plasma mem-
brane of prokaryotes. The protein consists of two
portions: a soluble fraction that contains three cat-
alytic sites and a membrane-bound portion that con-
tains anion channels. It functions in chemiosmosis,
the use of ion gradients across membranes, with
adjacent electron transport chains, and it uses the
30
assimilation

energy stored across the photosynthetic membrane (a
hydrogen-ion concentration gradient) to add inor-
ganic phosphate to ADP, thereby creating ATP. This
allows hydrogen ions (H+) to diffuse into the mito-
chondrion.
atrioventricular valve
A valve in the heart between
each atrium and ventricle. It prevents a backflow of
blood when the ventricles contract.
atrium (plural, atria)
An upper chamber that
receives blood from the veins returning to the verte-
brate heart and then pushes the blood to the ventricles,
the lower chambers. There is a left and right atrium.
Oxygenated blood returns from the lungs into the left
atrium and gets pushed down to the left ventricle. The
left ventricle pumps the blood out to the rest of the
body, transporting the oxygen to parts of the body that
need it. Blood returning from its voyage through the
body arrives in the right atrium. It then goes into the
right ventricle from which it goes through the lungs
again to get more oxygen, and the cycle continuously
repeats itself.
auranofin
See GOLD DRUGS.
autacoid
A biological substance secreted by various
cells whose physiological activity is restricted to the
vicinity of its release; it is often referred to as local
HORMONE.
autogenesis model
According to autogenesis (“self-
generating”), eukaryotic cells evolved by the specializa-
tion of internal membranes originally derived from
prokaryotic plasma membranes. This is another word
for spontaneous generation or abiogenesis.
autoimmune disease
An immunological disorder in
which the immune system turns against itself. Autoim-
munity can be the cause of a broad spectrum of human
illnesses. Autoimmune diseases were not accepted into
the mainstream of medicine until the 1950s and 1960s.
They are diseases in which the progression from benign
autoimmunity to pathogenic autoimmunity happens
over a period of time and is determined by both genetic
influences and environmental triggers. Examples of
autoimmune diseases are idiopathic thrombocytopenic
purpura, Graves’ disease, myasthenia gravis, pemphi-
gus vulgaris (cause of pemphigus), and bullous pem-
phigoid (a blistering disease).
autonomic nervous system (ANS)
A division of the
nervous system of vertebrates. The nervous system con-
sists of two major subdivisions: the central nervous sys-
tem (CNS), made up of the brain and spinal cord, and
the peripheral nervous system (PNS), which comprises
ganglia and peripheral nerves outside the brain and the
spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system is divided
into two parts: the somatic, which is concerned with
sensory information about the environment outside the
body as well as muscle and limb position; and the auto-
nomic nervous system that regulates the internal envi-
ronment of vertebrates. It consists of the sympathetic
(fight/flight), parasympathetic (rest/rebuild), and enteric
nervous systems. The ANS is involved in the function
of virtually every organ system.
The parasympathetic nervous system takes care of
essential background operations such as heart/lungs
and digestion, while the sympathetic nervous system
provides stress-response and procreation strategies and
functions. The enteric nervous system takes care of
controlling the function of the gut.
The sympathetic nerves form part of the nerve net-
work connecting the organ systems with the central ner-
vous system. The sympathetic nerves permit an animal
to respond to stressful situations and helps control the
reaction of the body to stress. Examples of the sympa-
thetic reactions are increase in heart rate, decrease in
secretion of salivary and digestive glands, and dilation
of pupils. The parasympathetic nerves connect both
somatic and visceral organs to the central nervous sys-
tem, and their primary action is to keep body functions
normalized. The ANS works to conserve the body’s
resources and to restore equilibrium to the resting state.
autophytic
The process whereby an organism uses
photosynthesis to make complex foods from inorganic
substances.
autophytic
31

autopolyploid
A type of polyploid species resulting
from one species doubling its chromosome number to
become tetraploid, which may self-fertilize or mate
with other tetraploids. This can result in sympatric spe-
ciation, where a new species can evolve in the geo-
graphical midst of its parent species because of
reproductive isolation.
See also POLYPLOIDY.
autoreceptor
Present at a nerve ending, a RECEPTOR
that regulates, via positive or negative feedback pro-
cesses, the synthesis and/or release of its own physio-
logical ligand.
See also HETERORECEPTOR.
autosome
A
chromosome that is not directly
involved in determining sex, as opposed to the sex
chromosomes or the mitochondrial chromosome.
Human cells have 22 pairs of autosomes.
autotroph
Any organism capable of making its
own food. It synthesizes its own organic food sub-
stances from inorganic compounds using sources such
as carbon dioxide, ammonia, and nitrates. Most
plants and many protists and bacteria are autotrophs.
Photoautotrophs can use light energy to make their
food (photosynthesis). Chemoautotrophs use chemical
energy to make their food by oxidizing compounds
such as hydrogen sulfide (H2S). Heterotrophs are
organisms that must obtain their energy from organic
compounds.
See also TROPHIC LEVEL.
auxins
A group of plant hormones that produce a
number of effects, including plant growth, phototropic
response through the stimulation of cell elongation
(photopropism), stimulation of secondary growth, 
apical dominance, and the development of leaf traces
and fruit. An important plant auxin is indole-3-acetic
acid (IAA). (IAA and synthetic auxins such as 2,4-D
and 2,4,5-T are used as common weed killers.)
auxotroph
A nutritionally mutant organism that is
unable to synthesize certain essential molecules (e.g.,
mineral salts and glucose) and that cannot grow on
media lacking these molecules normally synthesized by
wild-type strains of the same species without the addi-
tion of a specific supplement like an amino acid.
Aves
The vertebrate class of birds, characterized by
feathers and other flight adaptations, such as an active
metabolism, and distinguished by having the body
more or less completely covered with feathers and the
forelimbs modified as wings. Birds are a monophyletic
lineage that evolved once from a common ancestor, and
all birds are related through that common origin. There
are about 30 orders of birds, about 180 families, and
about 2,000 genera with 10,000 species.
axillary bud
An embryonic shoot present in the
angle formed by a leaf and stem. Also called the lateral
bud.
axon
A process from a neuron, usually covered with
a myelin sheath, that carries nerve impulses away from
the cell body and to the synapse in contact with a tar-
get cell. The end of the axon contains vesicles (hollow
spheres), in which transmitters are stored, and special-
ized structures forming the synapse.
See also NEURON.
azurin
An ELECTRON TRANSFER PROTEIN, containing a
TYPE 1 COPPER site, that is isolated from certain bacteria.
32
autopolyploid

bacteria
One of two prokaryotic (no nucleus)
domains, the other being the ARCHAEA. Bacteria are
microscopic, simple, single-cell organisms. Some bacte-
ria are harmless and often beneficial, playing a major
role in the cycling of nutrients in ecosystems via aerobic
and anaerobic decomposition (saprophytic), while oth-
ers are pathogenic, causing disease and even death.
Some species form symbiotic relationships with other
organisms, such as legumes, and help them survive in
the environment by fixing atmospheric nitrogen. Many
different species exist as single cells or colonies, and
they fall into four shapes based on the shape of their
rigid cell wall: coccal (spherical), bacillary (rod-shaped),
spirochetal (spiral/helical or corkscrew), and vibro
(comma-shaped). Bacteria are also classified on the
basis of oxygen requirement (aerobic vs. anaerobic).
In the laboratory, bacteria are classified as gram-
positive (blue) or gram-negative (pink) following a lab-
oratory procedure called a Gram’s stain. Gram-negative
bacteria, such as those that cause the plague, cholera,
typhoid fever, and salmonella, for example, have two
outer membranes, which make them more resistant to
conventional treatment. They can also easily mutate
and transfer these genetic changes to other strains,
making them more resistant to antibiotics. Gram-posi-
tive bacteria, such as those that cause anthrax and liste-
riosis, are more rare and are treatable with penicillin
but can cause severe damage by either releasing toxic
chemicals (e.g., clostridium botulinum) or by penetrat-

balanced polymorphism
The maintenance of two
or more alleles in a population due to the selective
advantage of the heterozygote. A heterozygote is a
genotype consisting of two different alleles of a gene
for a particular trait (Aa). Balanced polymorphism is a
type of polymorphism where the frequencies of the
coexisting forms do not change noticeably over many
generations. Polymorphism is a genetic trait controlled
by more than one allele, each of which has a frequency
of 1 percent or greater in the population gene pool.
Polymorphism can also be defined as two or more phe-
notypes maintained in the same breeding population.

Banting, Frederick Grant (1891–1941) Canadian
Physician
Frederick Grant Banting was born on
November 14, 1891, at Alliston, Ontario, Canada, to
William Thompson Banting and Margaret Grant.
He went to secondary school at Alliston and then
to the University of Toronto to study divinity before
changing to the study of medicine. In 1916 he took his
M.B. degree and joined the Canadian Army Medical
Corps and served in France during World War I. In
1918 he was wounded at the battle of Cambrai, and
the following year he was awarded the Military Cross
for heroism under fire.
In 1922 he was awarded his M.D. degree and was
appointed senior demonstrator in medicine at the Uni-
versity of Toronto. In 1923 he was elected to the Bant-
ing and Best Chair of Medical Research, which had
been endowed by the legislature of the Province of
Ontario.
Also in 1922, while working at the University of
Toronto in the laboratory of the Scottish physiologist
John James Richard MACLEOD, and with the assistance
of the Canadian physiologist Charles Best, Banting dis-
covered insulin after extracting it from the pancreas.
The following year he received the Nobel Prize in
medicine along with Macleod. Angered that Macleod,
rather than Best, had received the Nobel Prize, Banting
divided his share of the award equally with Best. It was
Canada’s first Nobel Prize. He was knighted in 1934.
The word banting was associated with dieting for
many years.
In February 1941 he was killed in an air disaster in
Newfoundland.
Bárány, Robert 
(1876–1936) Austrian Physician
Robert Bárány was born on April 22, 1876, in Vienna,
the eldest son of the manager of a farm estate. His
mother, Maria Hock, was the daughter of a well-known
Prague scientist. The young Bárány contracted tubercu-
losis, which resulted in permanent knee problems.
He completed medical studies at Vienna University
in 1900, and in 1903, he accepted a post as demonstra-
tor at the otological clinic.
Bárány developed a rotational method for testing
the middle ear, known as the vestibular system, that
commands physical balance by integrating an array of
neurological, biological, visual, and cognitive processes
to maintain balance. The middle ear’s vestibular system
is made up of three semicircular canals and an otolith.
Inside the canals are fluid and hairlike cilia that register
movement. As the head moves, so does the fluid, which
in turn moves the cilia that send signals to the brain
and nervous system. The function of the otolith, a
series of calcium fibers that remain oriented to gravity,
is similar. Both help the body to stay upright. Bárány’s
contributions in this area won him the Nobel Prize in
physiology in 1914. To receive his award, he had to be
released from a Russian prisoner of war camp in 1916
at the request of the prince of Sweden.
After the war he accepted the post of principal and
professor of the Otological Institute in Uppsala, where
he remained for the remainder of his life.
During the latter part of his life, Bárány studied the
causes of muscular rheumatism. Although he suffered a
stroke, this did not prevent him from writing on the
subject. He died at Uppsala on April 8, 1936. An elite
organization called the Bárány Society is named after
him and is devoted to vestibular research.

bacteriochlorophyll

barchan
A crescent-shaped dune with wings, or
horns, pointing downwind.
bark
The outer layer or “skin” of stems and trunks
that forms a protective layer. It is composed of all the
tissues outside the vascular cambium in a plant grow-
ing in thickness. Bark consists of phloem, phelloderm,
cork cambium, and cork.
Barr body
One of the two X chromosomes in each
somatic cell of a female is genetically inactivated. The
Barr body is a dense object or mass of condensed sex
chromatin lying along the inside of the nuclear enve-
lope in female mammalian cells; it represents the inacti-
vated X chromosome. X inactivation occurs around the
16th day of embryonic development. Mary Lyon, a
British cytogeneticist, introduced the term Barr body.
basal body (kinetosome)
A eukaryotic cell organelle
within the cell body where a flagellum arises, which is
usually composed of nine longitudinally oriented,
equally spaced sets of three microtubules. They usual-
ly occur in pairs and are structurally identical to a
centriole.
Not to be confused with basal body temperature
(BBT), which is the lowest body temperature of the
day, usually the temperature upon awakening in the
morning. BBT is usually charted daily and is used to
determine fertility or to achieve pregnancy.
basal metabolic rate (BMR)
BMR is the number of
calories your body burns at rest to maintain normal
body functions and changes with age, weight, height,
gender, diet, and exercise.
base
A substance that reduces the hydrogen ion con-
centration in a solution. A base has less free hydrogen
ions (H+) than hydroxyl ions (OH–) and has a pH of
more than 7 on a scale of 0–14. A base is created when
positively charged ions (base cations) such as magne-
sium, sodium, potassium, and calcium increase the pH
base

of water when released to solution. They have a slip-
pery feel in water and a bitter taste. A base will turn
red litmus paper blue (acids turn blue litmus red). The
three types of bases are: Arrhenius, any chemical that
increases the number of free hydroxide ions (OH–)
when added to a water-based solution; Bronsted or
Bronsted-Lowry, any chemical that acts as a proton
acceptor in a chemical reaction; and Lewis, any chemi-
cal that donates two electrons to form a covalent bond
during a chemical reaction. Bases are also known as
alkali or alkaline substances, and when added to acids
they form salts. Some common examples of bases are
soap, ammonia, and lye.
See also ACID; BRØNSTED BASE; HARD BASE; LEWIS
BASE.
basement membrane
The thin extracellular layer
composed of fibrous elements, proteins, and space-fill-
ing molecules that attaches the epithelium tissue
(which forms the superficial layer of skin and some
organs and the inner lining of blood vessels, ducts,
body cavities, and the interior of the respiratory, diges-
tive, urinary, and reproductive systems) to the underly-
ing connective tissue. It is made up of a superficial
basal lamina produced by the overlying epithelial tis-
sue, and an underlying reticular lamina, which is the
deeper of two layers and produced by the underlying
connective tissue. It is the layer of tissue that cells “sit”
or rest on.
base pairing
The specific association between two
complementary strands of nucleic acids that results from
the formation of hydrogen bonds between the base com-
ponents (adenine [A], guanine [G], thymine [T], cytosine
[C], uracil [U] of the NUCLEOTIDES of each strand (the
lines indicate the number of hydrogen bonds): 
A=T and G
C in DNA, A=U and G
C (and in some cases GU) in RNA
Single-stranded nucleic acid molecules can adopt a
partially double-stranded structure through intrastrand
base pairing.
See also NUCLEOSIDES.
base-pair substitution
There are two main types of
mutations within a gene: base-pair substitutions and
base-pair insertions or deletions. A base-pair substitu-
tion is a point mutation; it is the replacement of one
nucleotide and its partner from the complementary
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strand with another pair
of nucleotides. Bases are one of five compounds—ade-
nine, guanine, cytosine, thymine, and uracil—that form
the genetic code in DNA and ribonucleic acid (RNA).
basicity constant
See ACIDITY CONSTANT.
basidiomycetes
A group of fungi whose sexual
spores (basidiospores) are borne in a basidium, a club-
shaped reproductive cell. Includes the orders Agaricales
(mushrooms) and Aphyllophorales.
See also FUNGI.
basidium (plural, basidia)
A
specialized club-
shaped sexual reproductive cell found in the fertile area
of the hymenium, the fertile sexual spore-bearing tis-
sues of all basidiomycetes, and that produces sexual
spores on the gills of mushrooms. Shaped like a base-
ball bat, it possesses four slightly inwardly curved
horns or spikes called sterigma on which the basid-
iospores are attached.
Batesian mimicry
A type of mimicry described by H.
W. Bates in 1861 that describes the condition where a
harmless species, the mimic, looks like a different species
that is poisonous or otherwise harmful to predators, the
model, and in this way gains security and protection by
counterfeiting its appearance. Since many predators have
become sick from eating a poisonous animal, they will
avoid any similar looking animals in the future. Exam-
ples of Batesian mimicry include the Viceroy mimicking
the Monarch butterfly and the clearwing moth that
resembles a bee by having yellow and black coloring.
See also MIMICRY.
bathyal zone

basement membrane

B cell or lymphocyte
A type of white blood cell,
or lymphocyte, that makes up 25 percent or more of
the white blood cells in the body. The other class of
lymphocyte is T cells. B cells develop in the bone mar-
row and spleen, and during infections they are trans-
formed into plasma cells that produce large quantities
of antibody (immunoglobulin) directed at specific
pathogens. A cancer of the B lymphocytes is called a
B-cell lymphoma.
behavioral ecology
A subdiscipline that seeks to
understand the functions, or fitness consequences, 
of behavior in which animals interact with their 
environment.
Békésy, Georg von (1899–1972) Hungarian Physi-
cist
Georg von Békésy was born in Budapest, Hun-
gary, on June 3, 1899, to Alexander von Békésy, a
diplomat, and his wife Paula. He received his early edu-
cation in Munich, Constantinople, Budapest, and in a
private school in Zurich. He received a Ph.D. in physics
in 1923 from the University of Budapest for a method
he developed for determining molecular weight. He
began working for the Hungarian Telephone and Post
Office Laboratory in Budapest until 1946. During the
years 1939–46 he was also professor of experimental
physics at the University of Budapest.
While his research was concerned mainly with
problems of long-distance telephone transmission, he
conducted the study of the ear as a main component of
the transmission system. He designed a telephone ear-
phone and developed techniques for rapid, nondestruc-
tive dissection of the cochlea.
In 1946 he moved to Sweden as a guest of the
Karolinska Institute and did research at the Technical
Institute in Stockholm. Here he developed a new type
of audiometer. The following year he moved to the
United States to work at Harvard University in the
Psycho-Acoustic 
Laboratory
and 
developed 
a
mechanical model of the inner ear. He received the
Nobel Prize in 1961 for his discoveries concerning
the physical mechanisms of stimulation within the
cochlea. He moved on to the University of Hawaii in
1966, where a special laboratory was built for him.
He received numerous honors during his lifetime.
He died on June 13, 1972, in Honolulu.
benthic zone
A lower region of a freshwater or
marine body. It is below the pelagic zone and above the
abyssal zone, which is the benthic zone below 9,000 m.

stabilized in the form of a sheet by hydrogen bonds
between CO and NH groups of adjacent (parallel or
antiparallel) chains.
beta strand

biennial
A plant that requires two years or at least
more than one season to complete its life cycle. In the
first year, plants form vegetative growth, and in the sec-
ond year they flower. (Latin biennialis, from biennis;
bis, twice, and annus, year)
bifunctional ligand
A LIGAND that is capable of
simultaneous use of two of its donor atoms to bind to
one or more CENTRAL ATOMS.
See also AMBIDENTATE.
bilateral symmetry
Characterizing a body form
having two similar sides—one side of an object is the
mirror image of its other half—with definite upper and
lower surfaces and anterior and posterior ends. Also
called symmetry across an axis.
In plants, the term applies to flowers that can be
divided into two equal halves by only one line through
the middle. Most leaves are bilaterally symmetrical.
bilateria
Members of the branch of eumetazoans
possessing bilateral symmetry. Many bilaterian ani-
mals exhibit cephalization, an evolutionary
trend
toward concentration of sensory structures, mouth,
and nerve ganglia at the anterior end of the body. All
bilaterally symmetrical animals are triploblastic, that
is, having three germ layers: ectoderm, endoderm, and
mesoderm.
binary fission
A type of asexual reproduction in
prokaryotes (cells or organisms lacking a membrane-
bound, structurally discrete nucleus and other subcellu-
lar compartments) in which a cell divides or splits into
two “daughter” cells, each containing a complete copy
of the genetic material of the parent. Examples of organ-
isms that reproduce this way are bacteria, paramecium,
and Schizosaccharomyces pombe
(an ascomycetous
species of yeast). Also known as transverse fission.
binding constant
See STABILITY CONSTANT.
binding site
A specific region (or atom) in a molecu-
lar entity that is capable of entering into a stabilizing
interaction with another molecular entity. An example
of such an interaction is that of an ACTIVE SITE in an
enzyme with its SUBSTRATE. Typical forms of interac-
tion are by hydrogen bonding, COORDINATION, and
ion-pair formation. Two binding sites in different
molecular entities are said to be complementary if their
interaction is stabilizing.
binomial (binomial name)
Each organism is named
using a Latin-based code consisting of a combination
of two names, the first being a generic (genus) name
and the second a specific trivial name, which, together,
38

constitute the scientific name of a species. Lupinus
perennis, or wild blue lupine, is an example. Both
names are italicized, and both names used together
constitute the species name. This is an example of the
binomial nomenclature, critical to the system of classi-
fication of plants and animals. Linnaeus, a Swedish
naturalist, developed the system in the 18th century.
The hierarchy lists the smallest group to largest group:
species, genus, family, order, class, division, and king-
dom. The first person to formally describe a species is
often included, sometimes as an abbreviation, when the
species is first mentioned in a research article (e.g.,
Lupinus perennis L., where L. = Linnaeus, who first
produced this binomial name and provided an original
description of this plant).
binuclear
Less frequently used term for the IUPAC
recommended term dinuclear.
See also NUCLEARITY.
bioassay
A procedure for determining the concentra-
tion, purity, and/or biological activity of a substance
(e.g., vitamin, hormone, plant growth factor, antibiotic,
enzyme) by measuring its effect on an organism, tissue,
cell, enzyme, or receptor preparation compared with a
standard preparation.
bioavailability

or a XENOBIOTIC to an organ or organism.
biocatalyst
A catalyst of biological origin, typically
an ENZYME.
bioconjugate
A molecular species produced by living
systems of biological origin when it is composed of two
parts of different origins, e.g., a conjugate of a xenobi-
otic with some groups, such as glutathione, sulfate, or
glucuronic acid, to make it soluble in water or com-
partmentalized within the cell.
bioconversion
The conversion of one substance to
another by biological means. The fermentation of sug-
ars to alcohols, catalyzed by yeasts, is an example of
bioconversion.
See also BIOTRANSFORMATION.
biodiversity (biological diversity)
The totality of
genes, species, and ecosystems in a particular environ-
ment, region, or the entire world. Usually refers to the
variety and variability of living organisms and the
ecological relationships in which they occur. It can be
the number of different species and their relative fre-
quencies in a particular area, and it can be organized
on several levels, from specific species complexes to
entire ecosystems or even molecular-level heredity
studies.
bioenergetics
The study of the energy transfers in
and between organisms and their environments and the
regulation of those pathways. The term is also used for
a form of psychotherapy that works through the body
to engage the emotions and is based on the work of
Wilhelm Reich and psychiatrist Alexander Lowen in
the 1950s.
biofacies
A characteristic set of fossil fauna. Facies is
a geological term that means “aspect” and is used for
defining subdivisions based on an aspect or characteris-
tic of a rock formation, such as lithofacies, based on
physical characteristics, or biofacies, based on the fossil
content.
biogeochemical cycles
Both energy and inorganic
nutrients flow through ecosystems. However, energy is
a one-way process that drives the movement of nutri-
ents and is then lost, whereas nutrients are cycled back
into the system between organisms and their environ-
ments by way of molecules, ions, or elements. These
various nutrient circuits, which involve both biotic and
abiotic components of ecosystems, are called biogeo-
chemical cycles. Major biogeochemical cycles include
the water cycle, carbon cycle, oxygen cycle, nitrogen
cycle, phosphorus cycle, sulfur cycle, and calcium cycle.
Biogeochemical cycles can take place on a cellular level
(absorption of carbon dioxide by a cell) all the way to
global levels (atmosphere and ocean interactions).
biogeochemical cycles
39

These cycles take place through the biosphere, litho-
sphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere.
biogeographic boundary (zoogeographical region)
Six to nine regions that contain broadly similar fauna.
Consists of Nearctic, Palearctic, Neotropical, Aethiopi-
an, Oriental, and Australian, and some include Holarc-
tic, Palaeotropical, and Oceana.
biogeography
The study of the past and present dis-
tribution of life.
bioisostere (nonclassical 
isostere)
A
compound
resulting from the exchange of an atom or of a group
of atoms with another broadly similar atom or group
of atoms. The objective of a bioisosteric replacement
is to create a new compound with similar biological
properties to the parent compound. The bioisosteric
replacement can be physicochemically or topologically
based.
See also ISOSTERE.
bioleaching
Extraction of metals from ores or soil
by biological processes, mostly by microorganisms.
biological clock
The internal timekeeping that
drives or coordinates a circadian rhythm.
biological control (integrated pest management)
Using living organisms to control other living organ-
isms (pests), e.g., aphids eaten by lady beetles.
biological half-life
The time at which the amount of
a biomolecule in a living organism has been reduced by
one half.
See also HALF-LIFE.
biological magnification (bioaccumulation)  The
increase in the concentration of heavy metals (e.g., mer-
cury) or organic contaminants (e.g., chlorinated hydro-
carbons [CBCs]) in organisms as a result of their
consumption within a food chain/web. An excellent
example is the process by which contaminants such as
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) accumulate or magni-
fy as they move up the food chain. For example, PCBs
concentrate in tissue and internal organs, and as big fish
eat little fish, they accumulate all the PCBs that have
been eaten by everyone below them in the food chain.
biological species
A population or group of popula-
tions whose members can interbreed or have the poten-
tial to interbreed.
See also SPECIES.
bioluminescence
The process of producing light by
a chemical reaction by a living organism, e.g., glow-
worms, fireflies, and jellyfish. Usually produced in
organs called photopores or light organs, biolumines-
cence can be used for luring prey or as a courting
behavior.
biomass
The dry weight of organic matter in unit area
or volume, usually expressed as mass or weight of a
group of organisms in a particular habitat. The term also
refers to organic matter that is available on a renewable
basis such as forests, agricultural crops, wood and wood
wastes, animals, and plants.

many times during the history of life on Earth. In more
recent times, change has been the result of human-
induced activity.

tems, tissues, organelles, or whole cells to detect chemi-
cal compounds, usually by electrical, thermal, or
optical signals.
biosphere

outer portion of the geosphere (the physical elements of
the Earth’s surface crust and interior) and the inner por-
tion of the atmosphere that is inhabited by life; it is the
sum of all the planet’s communities and ecosystems.
biotechnology
The industrial or commercial manip-
ulation and use of living organisms or their compo-
nents to improve human health and food production,

center of the blastula embryo. The blastula is an early
stage in the development of an ovum, consisting of a
hollow sphere of cells enclosing the blastocoel.
See also BLASTULA.
blastocyst
An embryonic stage in mammals; a hollow
ball of 30–150 cells produced one week after FERTILIZA-
TION in humans. It is a sphere made up of an outer
layer of cells called the trophectoderm, a fluid-filled 
cavity called the BLASTOCOEL, and a cluster of cells on
the interior called the INNER CELL MASS. It is the inner
cell mass that becomes what is known as the FETUS.

(primitive gut) in the gastrula that develops into the
mouth in protostomes (metazoans such as the nema-
todes, flatworms, and mollusks that exhibit determi-
nate, spiral cleavage and develop a mouth from the
blastopore) and the anus in deuterostomes. (Animals
such as the chordates and echinoderms in which the
first opening in the embryo becomes the anus, while
the mouth appears at the other end of the digestive
system.)

blood
Blood is an animal fluid that transports oxy-
gen from the lungs to body tissues and returns carbon
dioxide from body tissues to the lungs through a net-
work of vessels such as veins, arteries, and capillaries.
It transports nourishment from digestion, hormones
from glands, carries disease-fighting substances to tis-
sues, as well as wastes to the kidneys. Blood contains
red and white blood cells and platelets that are respon-
sible for a variety of functions, from transporting sub-
stances to fighting invasion from foreign substances.
Some 55 percent of blood is a clear liquid called plas-
ma. The average adult has about five liters of blood.
See also ARTERY; CAPILLARY; VEIN.
blood-brain barrier (BBB)
The blood-brain barrier
is a collection of cells that press together to block many
substances from entering the brain while allowing oth-
ers to pass. It is a specialized arrangement of brain cap-
illaries that restricts the passage of most substances into
the brain, thereby preventing dramatic fluctuations in
the brain’s environment. It maintains the chemical envi-
ronment for neuron functions and protects the brain
from the entry of foreign and harmful substances. It
allows substances in the brain such as glucose, certain
ions, and oxygen and others to enter, while unwanted
ones are carried out by the endothelial cells. It is a
defensive system to protect the central nervous system.
What is little understood is how the blood-brain
barrier is regulated, or why certain diseases are able to
manipulate and pass through the barrier.
There is evidence that multiple sclerosis attacks
occur during breakdowns of the blood-brain barrier. A
study in rats showed that flavinoids, such as those
found in blueberries and grape seeds among others, can
inhibit blood-brain barrier breakdown under condi-
tions that normally lead to such breakdown.
Researchers at the University of Maryland School
of Medicine in Baltimore have identified a receptor in
the human brain that regulates the interface between
the bloodstream and the blood-brain barrier and
could lead to a new understanding of this nearly
impenetrable barrier and to treatment of diseases that
affect the brain. They found that two proteins,
zonulin and zot, unlock the cell barrier in the intes-
tine, attach themselves to receptors in the intestine to
open the junctions between the cells, and allow sub-
stances to be absorbed. The new research indicates
that zonulin and zot also react with similar receptors
in the brain, suggesting that it may become feasible to
develop a new generation of drugs able to cross the
blood-brain barrier.

Blood Identification through the Ages
by John C. Brenner and Demetra Xythalis
Blood is a fluid that circulates throughout the body, trans-
porting oxygen, nutrients and waste materials. Blood is
composed of various formed elements such as red blood
cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), platelets
(thrombocytes), and a liquid fraction called plasma, each
containing a vast array of biochemical constituents. Red
blood cells comprise the majority of the formed elements in
the blood. Hemoglobin is a chemical that is found in red
blood cells, consisting of an iron-containing pigment, heme,
and a protein component, globin. The components of blood
are controlled genetically and have the potential of being a
highly distinctive feature for personal identification.
The field of forensic science is the study and practice
of the application of natural sciences for the purpose of the
law. One of the disciplines in forensic science is forensic
serology, which involves the identification and characteri-
zation of blood and body fluids, either in a liquid or dried
state, in association with a criminal or civil investigation.
Blood and dried bloodstains are two of the most important
and most frequently encountered types of evidence in crim-
inal investigation of crimes such as homicides, assaults,
and rapes.
Since the 1900s, forensic serologists have attempted to
identify blood and/or bloodstains found at crime scenes.
When serology was in its early stages, stains at crime
scenes were identified just as blood. Now that forensic
serologists can individualize human blood by identifying all
of its known factors, the result could be evidence of the
strongest kind for linking a suspect to the crime scene or
finding a lost victim.
When examining dried bloodstains, the forensic serol-
ogists are trying to determine the following: (1) Is the stain
blood? (2) If the stain is blood, is it human or animal? (3) If

the stain is human blood, can it be associated with a partic-
ular individual? The forensic serologist, in an attempt to do
blood identification, uses two categories of tests: the pre-
sumptive test, which is nonspecific for blood, and the con-
firmatory, which is specific for blood species.
The first step in determining whether a crime scene
stain is blood involves the use of a chemical screening test
or presumptive test. Some presumptive tests used by foren-
sic serologists include benzidine (introduced in 1904), phe-
nolphthalein (1901), leucomalachite green (1904), and
luminol (1928).
The identification of benzidine as a carcinogen led to
its discontinuance as a screening test for blood. Another
chemical used for screening stains for blood is phenolph-
thalein. Both tests consist of a two-step procedure. The
first step is to moisten a white filter paper with distilled
water. Apply the filter paper to the suspected bloodstain.
A portion of the stain will transfer onto the moistened
paper. Add the leucomalachite green reagent to the
paper. The second step is to add hydrogen peroxide to the
filter paper and look for a color change on the paper. A
positive result will yeild a bluish-green color. When phe-
nolphthalein is mixed with a dried bloodstain, with the
addition of hydrogen peroxide, the hemoglobin in the
blood causes the formation of a deep pink color. The leu-
comalachite green test is a presumptive test for blood
that is used by many laboratories today. The heme group
in hemoglobin catalyzes the oxidation by peroxide of the
malachite green to produce a bluish-green reaction when
the suspected stain is blood.
Luminol is a chemical reagent that is very useful in
locating small traces of blood at a crime scene. Unlike the
above-mentioned chemical screening test, the reaction of
luminol with blood results in the production of light rather
than color. The one requirement for the use of luminol is
that the scene be completely dark. Luminol is a chemical
that can be used as a spray at crime scenes and will react
with any blood present, causing a luminescence.
The second step in blood identification is the use of
confirmatory tests. Confirmatory blood identification tests
are specific for the heme component of hemoglobin. A posi-
tive confirmatory test result is taken as positive proof of the
presence of blood in a questioned stain. Some of the confir-
matory tests include: microcrystalline tests, Teichmann and
Takayama tests, ring precipitin test, gel diffusion method,
and electrophoresis (1907). The Teichmann (1853) and the
Takayama (1905) confirmatory tests are based on the obser-
vation that heme, in the presence of certain chemicals, will
form characteristic crystals that can be seen using a micro-
scope.
The precipitin test is based on antibody molecules
interacting with antigens to form a precipitate that can be
visualized under the proper light conditions or with a stain.
Serologists use this test to determine whether the origin of
the bloodstain is human or animal. The ring precipitin test
involves layering a dilute saline extract of the bloodstain on
top of the antihuman serum in a capillary tube. Because of
the density of the antihuman serum, the bloodstain extract
will layer on top, and the two solutions will not mix, thus
forming a cloudy ring or band at the interface between the
two solutions.
The gel diffusion method is based on the fact that anti-
gens and antibodies will diffuse, or move toward each
other, on an agar-gel-coated plate, such as the Ouchterlony
plate. The extracted bloodstain and the human antiserum
are placed in separate holes opposite each other on the gel.
A white precipitate line will form where the antigens and
antibodies meet if the bloodstain is of human origin.
The electrophoretic method, or crossover elec-
trophoresis, is a sensitive method using an electric current
that is passed through a gel plate. A line of precipitation
formed between the hole containing the bloodstain extract
and the hole containing the human antiserum denotes a
specific antigen antibody reaction.
The next generation of confirmatory test, which in
some forensic laboratories has replaced the electrophoret-
ic or crossover electrophoresis is called the One Step
ABAcard HemaTrace. This test utilizes a combination of
monoclonal and polyclonal antibody reagents to selectively
detect human hemoglobin. Adding a portion of the prepared
elution from the bloodstain to the sample well and observ-
ing the development of indicative colored lines conduct the
test. The species specificity of the reaction is based on the
recognition by antibodies of antigens displayed on human
hemoglobin. A positive result is visualized because gold-
conjugated, monoclonal antibody-Hb immune complexes
are captured and condensed on the test mambrane by sta-
tionary phase polyclonal anti-human hemoglobin antibod-
ies, causing the gold particles to condense. This produces a
pink-colored line at the test area. Absence of this colored
line indicates a negative result.
There are many different substances in human blood
that can be grouped to individualize the blood. Blood con-
tains many inherited factors referred to as genetic markers.
Determination of factors in a person’s blood is called blood
grouping or blood typing. True individualization of a speci-
men of blood would mean that a sufficiently large number of
genetic markers could be typed so that nobody else in the

world would have that particular combination of genetic
markers.
In 1900, Dr. Karl Landsteiner announced one of the
most significant discoveries of the 20th century—the typing
of human blood. Out of Landsteiner’s work came the classi-
fication system that is called the ABO system. Blood group
systems are the most well known and widely recognized
class of genetic markers.
Bloodstains can be typed for ABO using two different
procedures: (1) by detecting the antibodies of the serum or
(2) by detecting the antigens of the red cells. Detection of
the antibodies is the older method. This procedure was first
extensively employed by Lattes in Italy in 1913. The proce-
dure has been modified and improved with the development
of new antisera. In this test, which detects antibodies in
dried bloodstains, two portions of the stains are placed onto
microscope slides. Type A red cells are added to one glass
slide, and Type B red cells to the other slide. If the blood-
stain on the slide contains anti-A antibodies, the A red cells
that were added will agglutinate, which looks like
crosslinked cells under the microscope. Agglutination of the
A cells indicates that anti-A is present, and therefore, that
the bloodstain is of blood group B.
The other approach to typing dried bloodstains is the
detection of the antigens that are on the surface of the red
blood cells. When blood dries, the red cells break apart, but
the red blood cell antigens are still present in the dried stains.
The two major methods that have been used are absorption-
inhibition and absorption-elution. The absorption-inhibition
method depends on the ability to estimate the amount of
antibody present in an antiserum before and after exposure
to a stain extract containing a possible antigen.
The absorption-elution method is based on the theory
that blood-group antibodies can bind to their specific red-
cell surface antigens in bloodstains. The antigen-antibody
complex can then be dissociated and the antibodies recov-
ered. The breaking of the antigen-antibody bond can be
done by increasing the temperature. Removing specific
antibodies from complexes with their antigens in this way is
called elution.
Another main class of blood constituents used as
genetic markers is the polymorphic enzymes. The enzymes
of interest to the forensic serologists are primarily located
within the red blood cell and are commonly referred to as
isoenzymes. These enzyme forms can be grouped from a
bloodstain to further individualize the blood. Red-cell isoen-
zymes are frequently typed by a procedure called elec-
trophoresis. This procedure brings about the separation of
different proteins based primarily upon differences in net
charge, and it is usually done with some kind of starch-gel
or on a cellulose acetate support. The most important
enzyme systems used in forensic serology are phosphoglu-
comutase (PGM), erythrocyte acid phosphatase (EAP),
esterase D (ESD), adenylate kinase (AK), adenosine deami-
nase (ADA), and glyoxalase I (GLO).
The main features of the molecular architecture of
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) were first formulated by Wat-
son and Crick in 1953, who at the same time pointed out
how the proposed structure would account for the three
basic attributes of genetic material: gene specificity, gene
replication, and gene mutation. It was not until 1985 that
forensic scientists discovered that portions of the DNA
structure of certain genes are as unique to an individual as
their fingerprints. Alec Jeffreys and his colleagues at
Leicester University, England, who were responsible for
these revelations, named the process for isolating and
reading these DNA markers “DNA fingerprinting.” The DNA
typing of biological fluid and stains finally gives the forensic
scientist the ability to link crime scene evidence such as
bloodstains to a single individual.
The separation of DNA fragments of different sizes
usually can be efficiently accomplished by agarose gel
electrophoresis. The agarose gels are thick, which makes
them difficult to process in terms of hybridization, washing,
and autoradiography. To overcome these problems, a
transfer technique was developed that transferred the
DNA fragments from the agarose gel onto a nylon mem-
brane. This technique was first described by E. Southern in
1975, and it is called Southern blotting. If a specific recog-
nition base sequence is present, the restriction enzyme
recognizing that site will cleave the DNA molecule, result-
ing in fragments of specific base-pair lengths. Restriction
fragment length polymorphism (RFLPs) generates different
DNA fragment lengths by the action of specific endonucle-
ases. To visualize the separate RFLPs, a nylon sheet is
treated with radioactively labeled probes containing a
base sequence complementary to the RFLPs being identi-
fied, a process called hybridization. Once the radioactive
sequences are on the nylon membrane, the membrane is
exposed to a piece of X-ray film. The developed X-ray film
shows DNA fragments that combined with radioactive
probe. The size of the bloodstain (i.e., the amount of blood
required) on forensic evidence and the time required to
obtain the DNA information from the evidence were two
drawbacks to this procedure.
As the push to individualize forensic bloodstain pro-
ceeded, the next advancement came in 1983, with molecular

blood pressure
The hydrostatic force that blood
exerts against the wall of a blood vessel. This pressure
is greatest during the contraction of the ventricles of
the heart (systolic pressure), which forces blood into
the arterial system. Pressure falls to its lowest level
when the heart is filling with blood while at rest (dias-
tolic pressure). Blood pressure varies depending on the
energy of the heart action, the elasticity of the walls of
the arteries, and the volume and viscosity (resistance)
of the blood. Blood pressure rises and falls throughout
the day.
When the blood flows through the vessels at a
greater than normal force, reading consistently above
140/90 mm Hg (millimeters of mercury), it is called
hypertension or high blood pressure. High blood pres-
sure strains the heart; harms the arteries; and increases
the risk of heart attack, stroke, and kidney problems.
About one in every five adults in the United States has
high blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure occurs
more often in men than in women, and in African
Americans it occurs almost twice as often as in Cau-
casians. Essential hypertension (hypertension with no
known cause) is not fully understood, but it accounts
for about 90 percent of all hypertension cases in people
over 45 years of age.
Low blood pressure is called hypotension and is an
abnormal condition in which the blood pressure is
lower than 90/60 mm Hg. When the blood pressure is
too low, there is inadequate blood flow to the heart,
brain, and other vital organs.
An optimal blood pressure is less than 120/80 mm
Hg.

biologist Kary Mullis’s development of a process called
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR has revolutionized
the approach to the recovery of DNA from a variety of
sources. Availability of oligonucleotide primers is the key to
the amplification process. PCR consists of three steps,
beginning with the denaturing of the double-strand DNA,
separated by heating to 90–96°C. The second step involves
hybridization or annealing, in which one primer is annealed
to the flanking end of each DNA target sequence comple-
mentary strand. The third step uses a thermally stable Taq
polymerase to mediate the extension of the primers. The
result is two new helices in place of the first, each one
composed of the original strands plus its newly assembled
complementary strand.
All eukaryotic genomes contain regions of simple
repetitive DNA, called short tandem repeats (STR) or
microsatellites, which consist of variable numbers of tan-
dem repeats (VNTRs). The number of repeats at an STR
locus can be highly variable among individuals, resulting in
different-length polymorphisms that can be detected by
relatively simple use of the PCR-based assays. STR loci are
useful to forensic science because of their small range of
alleles, their high sensitivity, and suitability even if the DNA
is degraded. Today the forensic laboratory using the
PCR/STR analysis can individualize bloodstains obtained
from forensic evidence with a very high probability of iden-
tifying a single individual.
In the past, forensic scientists who handled biological
forensic evidence were only able to tell the investigating
official whether the dried stain at the crime scene was
blood. Today the forensic laboratory reports contain informa-
tion about dried stains at crime scenes that can be related to
one individual. This information has been tremendously help-
ful in the investigation of crimes. With the establishment of a
DNA database, physical evidence collected from the crime
scene that contains biological stains can be analyzed even
if there is no suspect. The DNA profile developed from
forensic bloodstain evidence can be compared with various
DNA databases to develop a match, which could lead to
identification of an individual.

the copper nucleus. Both characteristics are attributed
to COORDINATION of the copper by a cysteine sulfur.
bond energy (bond dissociation energy)
Atoms in a
molecule are held together by covalent bonds, and to
break these bonds atoms need bond energy. The
source of energy to break the bonds can be in the
form of heat, electricity, or mechanical means. Bond
energy is the quantity of energy that must be absorbed
to break a particular kind of chemical bond. It is
equal to the quantity of energy the bond releases
when it forms. It can also be defined as the amount of
energy necessary to break one mole of bonds of a
given kind (in gas phase).

from the radiation emitted by RADIONUCLIDES that have
been absorbed by the bone. Radionuclides such as 18F,
85Sr, and 99mTc are introduced as complexes with spe-
cific LIGANDs (very often phosphonate ligands) and are
absorbed in the bones by metabolic activity.

Bordet, 
Jules (1870–1961) Belgian Bacteriologist,
Immunologist
Jules Bordet was born in Soignies, Bel-
gium, on June 13, 1870. He was educated in Brussels
and graduated with a doctor of medicine in 1892. Two
years later he went to Paris and began work at the Pas-
teur Institute, where he worked on the destruction of
bacteria and explored red blood cells in blood serum,
contributing to the founding of serology, the study of
immune reactions in bodily fluids. In 1901 he returned
to Belgium to found the Pasteur Institute of Brabant,
Brussels, where he served until 1940. He was director
of the Belgian Institute and professor of bacteriology at
the University of Brussels (1907–35).
His work in immunology included finding two
components of blood serum responsible for bacterioly-
sis (rupturing of bacterial cell walls) and the process of
hemolysis (rupturing of foreign red blood cells in blood
serum). Working with his colleague Octave Gengou,
Bordet developed several serological tests for diseases
such as typhoid fever, tuberculosis, and syphilis. The
bacteria responsible for whooping cough, Bordetella
pertussis, was named for him after he and Gengou dis-
covered it in 1906. In 1919, he received the Nobel
Prize in physiology and medicine for his immunological
discoveries.
He was the author of Traité de l’immunité dans 
les maladies infectieuses (Treatise on immunity in infec-
tious diseases) and numerous medical publications.
Bordet was a permanent member of the adminis-
trative council of Brussels University, president of the
First International Congress of Microbiology (Paris,
1930), and member of numerous scientific societies. He
died on April 6, 1961.
bottleneck effect
A dramatic reduction in genetic
diversity of a population or species when the popula-
tion number is severely depleted by natural disaster, by
disease, or by changed environmental conditions. This
limits genetic diversity, since the few survivors are the

are based.
Bovet, 
Daniels 
(1907–1992) 
Swiss Physiologist
Daniel Bovet was born in Neuchâtel, Switzerland, on
March 23, 1907, to Pierre Bovet, professor of peda-
gogy at the University of Geneva, and Amy Babut. He
graduated from the University of Geneva in 1927 and
then worked on a doctorate in zoology and compara-
tive anatomy, which he received in 1929.
During the years 1929 until 1947 he worked at the
Pasteur Institute in Paris, starting as an assistant and
later as chief of the institute’s Laboratory of Therapeu-
tic Chemistry. Here he discovered the first synthetic
antihistamine, pyrilamine (meplyramine). In 1947 he
went to Rome to organize a laboratory of therapeutic
chemistry and became an Italian citizen. He became the
laboratory’s chief at the Istituto Superiore di Sanità,
Rome. Seeking a substitute for curare, a muscle relax-
ant, for anesthesia, he discovered gallamine (trade

name Flaxedil), a neuromuscular blocking agent used
today as a muscle relaxant in the administration of
anesthesia.
He and his wife Filomena Nitti published two
important books, Structure chimique et activité phar-
macodynamique des médicaments du système nerveux
végétatif (The chemical structure and pharmacody-
namic activity of drugs of the vegetative nervous sys-
tem) in 1948 and, with G. B. Marini-Bettòlo, Curare
and Curare-like Agents (1959). In 1957 he was
awarded the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine
for his discovery relating to synthetic compounds for
the blocking of the effects of certain substances occur-
ring in the body, especially in its blood vessels and
skeletal muscles.
Bovet published more than 300 papers and
received numerous awards. He served as the head of
the psychobiology and psychopharmacology laboratory
of the National Research Council (Rome) from 1969
until 1971, when he became professor of psychobiolo-
gy at the University of Rome (1971–82). He died on
April 8, 1992, in Rome.
Bowman’s capsule
A cup-shaped receptacle in the
kidney that contains the glomerulus, a semipermeable
twisted mass of tiny tubes through which the blood
passes and is the primary filtering device of the
nephron, a tiny structure that produces urine during
the process of removing wastes. Each kidney is made
up of about 1 million nephrons. Blood is transported
into the Bowman’s capsule from the afferent arteriole
that branches off of the interlobular artery. The blood
is filtered out within the capsule, through the glomeru-
lus, and then passes out by way of the efferent arteri-
ole. The filtered water and aqueous wastes are passed
out of the Bowman’s capsule into the proximal convo-
luted tubule, where it passes through the loop of Heinle
and into the distal convoluted tubule. Eventually the
urine passes and filters through the tiny ducts of the
calyces, the smallest part of the kidney collecting sys-
tem, where it begins to be collected and passes down
into the pelvis of the kidney before it makes its way to
the ureter and to the bladder for elimination.

The brain stem is the base of the brain and connects
the brain’s cerebrum to the spinal cord. It shares several
features in common with the brain of reptiles and con-
trols automatic and motor basic functions such as heart
rate and respiration and also is the main channel for
sensory and motor signals.

motion of particles colliding with molecules of a gas or
liquid in which they are suspended.
bryophytes
The 
mosses 
(Bryophyta), 
liverworts
(Hepatophyta), and hornworts (Anthocerophyta); a
group of small, rootless, thalloid (single cell, colony, 
filament of cells, or a large branching multicellular
structure) or leafy nonvascular plants with life cycles
dominated by the gametophyte phase. These plants
inhabit the land but lack many of the terrestrial adap-
tations of vascular plants, such as specialized vascular
or transporting tissues (e.g., xylem and phloem).
Terrestrial bryophytes are important for soil fixa-
tion and humus buildup. In pioneer vegetation, 
they provide a suitable habitat for seedlings of early
pioneering plants. Bryophytes are also early colonizers
after fire and contribute to nutrient cycles.
bubonic plague
A bacterial disease marked by chills,
fever, and inflammatory swelling of lymphatic glands
found in rodents and humans. It is caused by Pasteurel-
la pestis and transmitted by the oriental rat flea. The
famous Black Death that devastated the population of
Europe and Asia in the 1300s was a form of bubonic
plague.
budding
An asexual means of propagation in which a
group of self-supportive outgrowths (buds) from the
parent form and detach to live independently, or else
remain attached to eventually form extensive colonies.
The propagation of yeast is a good example of budding.
Also a type of grafting that consists of inserting a
single bud into a stock.
buffer
A molecule or chemical used to control the
pH of a solution. It consists of acid and base forms and
minimizes changes in pH when extraneous acids or
bases are added to the solution. It prevents large
changes in pH by either combining with H+ or by
releasing H+ into solution.

C3 plant
The majority of photosynthetic plants that
produce, as the initial steps of CO2 incorporation, a
three-carbon compound, phosphoglyceric acid (PGA),
as the first stable intermediate (CALVIN CYCLE). The
PGA molecules are further phosphorylated (by ATP)
and are reduced by NADPH to form phosphoglyceralde-
hyde (PGAL), which then serves as the starting material
for the synthesis of glucose and fructose, which, when
combined, make sucrose that travels through the plant.
Velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti) is an example of a C3
plant.
C4 plant
A small number of plants that incorpo-
rate CO2 using a carboxylase for the CO2 capture,
producing a four-carbon compound (carboxylic acid)
as a stable intermediary in the first step of photosyn-
thesis. C4 plants (e.g., corn) supply CO2 for the
CALVIN CYCLE.

An aggregate of molecules, generally in the con-
densed phase, that surround the fragments formed by
thermal or photochemical dissociation of a species.
calcitonin
Calcitonin is a hormone produced by the
thyroid gland that acts primarily on bone. It inhibits
bone removal by osteoclasts and promotes bone forma-
tion by osteoblasts; lowers blood calcium levels.
calmodulin
A Ca2+ binding protein involved in mus-
cular contraction.
calorie
An energy measurement unit; the amount of
energy required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water
by 1°C. A kilocalorie (1,000 calories) is used in food
science to describe the energy content of food products.
calpain
A calcium-activated neutral protease.
Calvin cycle
The second major stage in photosyn-
thesis after light reactions—discovered by chemist
Melvin Calvin (1911–97)—whereby carbon molecules
from CO2 are fixed into sugar (glucose) and mediated
by the enzyme rubisco (ribulose-1-5-biphosphate car-
boxylase). It occurs in the stroma of chloroplasts. The
Calvin cycle is also known as the dark reaction, as
opposed to the first-stage light reactions.
CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism)
A metabolic
adaptation of certain plants, particularly xerophytes
(desert loving, e.g., succulents), in arid areas that
allows them to take up CO2 at night, not during the
51
C

day, store it as organic acid (malic), and release CO2 by
decarboxylation of the acids for fixing into sugar. This
reduces transpirational water loss during photosynthe-
sis. The CALVIN CYCLE occurs during the day.
Cambrian explosion
A period about 530 million
years ago (Cambrian age) when a large explosion of
species, both in number and diversity, appeared on
Earth. It lasted about 10 million years, and it is the first

taken out of the body via the lungs. They act as the
bridge between the arteries, which carry blood away
from the heart, and the veins, which carry blood back
to the heart.

capsid
The outer protein coat or shell of a virus sur-
rounding its genetic material. Also capsid bugs (capsi-
dae), which number over 6,000 species and live on
plants, sucking juice and damaging cultivated plants.
carbohydrate
A large class of compounds that con-
tain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen in a general formu-
la of Cn(H2O)n. Classified from simple to complex,
they form mono-, di-, tri-, poly-, and heterosaccha-
rides. Examples include sugars (monosaccharide, di-
and polysaccharides), starches, and cellulose. Carbohy-
drates are used as an energy source by organisms, and
most are formed by green plants and are obtained by
animals via food intake.
carbon dioxide (CO2)
A colorless, odorless gas that
makes up the fourth most abundant gas in the atmo-
sphere. Used by plants in carbon fixation. Atmospheric
CO2 has increased about 25 percent since the early
1800s due to burning fossil fuels and deforestation.
Increased amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere enhance
the greenhouse effect, blocking heat from escaping into
space and contributing to the warming of Earth’s lower
atmosphere and affecting the world’s biota. This is a
major issue currently being debated by scientists
around the world.
See also GREENHOUSE EFFECT.
carbon fixation
The process by which carbon atoms
from CO2 gas are incorporated into sugars. Carbon
fixation occurs in the chloroplasts of green plants or
any photosynthetic or chemoautotrophic organism.
carbonic anhydrase
A
zinc-containing 
ENZYME
(carbonate hydrolyase, carbonate dehydratase) that
catalyzes the reversible decomposition of carbonic acid
to carbon dioxide and water.
Carboniferous period
A
geological time period
(360 to 280 millions of years ago) during the middle-
to-late Paleozoic era. It is divided into the Pennsylvani-
an period (325 to 280 millions of years ago) and the
Mississippian period (360 to 325 millions of years
ago).

One of the three muscle types (the
others are skeletal and smooth); found in the walls of
the heart, each rectangular heart muscle cell has one
central nucleuslike smooth muscle, but it is striated like
skeletal muscle. These cells are joined by intercalated

Carrel, Alexis (1873–1944) French Surgeon
Alexis
Carrel was born in Lyons, France, on June 28, 1873, to
a businessman, also named Alexis Carrel, who died
when his son was very young. Carrel was educated at
home by his mother Anne Ricard and at St. Joseph
School, in Lyons. He received a bachelor of letters
degree in 1889 from the University of Lyons, a bache-
lor of science the following year, and, in 1900, his Ph.D.
at the same university. He worked as prosector at the
Lyons Hospital and taught anatomy and operative
surgery at the university. By 1906, he was at the Rocke-
feller Institute for Medical Research, where he carried
out most of his landmark experiments.
Influenced by the assassination by knife of the pres-
ident of France in 1894, he dedicated himself to develop
a way to suture blood vessels, which ironically he devel-
oped after he studied with a French embroidress who
showed him how to do embroidery. His first attempt
was made in France in 1902. He subsequently devel-
oped the triangulation technique of vascular suture. He
won the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1912
for his work on vascular suture and the transplantation
of blood vessels and organs.
During World War I, Carrel served as a major in
the French army medical corps and helped devise a
widely used method of treating war wounds, called the
Carrel-Dakin method, a method of wound irrigation in
which the wound is intermittently irrigated with
Dakin’s solution, a germicidal fluid (no longer used).
Carrel’s researches were mainly concerned with
experimental surgery and the transplantation of tissues
and whole organs. As early as 1902, he published a tech-
nique for the end-to-end anastomosis (union) of blood
vessels, and during the next few years he did every con-
ceivable form of anastomosis, although many were not
accepted until the 1950s. In 1908, he devised methods
for the transplantation of whole organs and had tested
kidney and heart transplantations as early as 1905. In
1910 he demonstrated that blood vessels could be kept
for long periods in cold storage before they were used as
transplants in surgery, and he also conducted aortocoro-
nary bypass surgery, before the advent of anticoagulants.
In 1935, in collaboration with Charles Lindbergh,
Carrel devised a machine for supplying a sterile respira-
tory system to organs removed from the body. Carrel
was able to perform surgeries that showed that circula-
tion, even in such vital organs as the kidneys, could be
interrupted for as long as two hours without causing
permanent damage. The cover of the June 13, 1938,
Time magazine showed Charles Lindbergh and Alexis
Carrel with the new perfusion pump.
His books, such as The Culture of Organs and
Man, the Unknown, Treatment of Infected Wounds
(with Georges Debelly), were important works. He
died in Paris on November 5, 1944.
carrier
An individual who is heterozygous for a
recessive disease-causing trait but who does not neces-
sarily show any symptoms and can pass the mutant
gene to offspring. If both parents are homozygous for

carrying capacity
A population’s maximum capacity
within a habitat that a single species can maintain
before the habitat degrades or becomes destroyed.
While a species may go over the carrying capacity, the
long-term viability of the habitat is destined to lessen
or be depleted.
cartilage
A rubbery but firm and flexible shock-
absorber tissue that cushions bones at the joints and
can be found in other areas like the spine, throat,
ears, and nose. Made up of cells called chondroblasts
that secrete a cartilage matrix (containing cells called
chondrocytes when surrounded by a matrix), an
intracellular substance. Cartilage is covered by a
membrane called perichondrium that serves for nutri-
tion and growth of the cartilage. Osteoarthritis can
occur when cartilage is worn away faster than it is
replaced. The underlying bones then start to rub
against each other.

stance that waterproofs the walls of each plant’s 
root cells; prevents and controls passive water and
mineral uptake into the central vascular tube of roots
(steles).
caste

colony, e.g., ants, that are also behaviorally specialized
such as queens, workers, soldiers, etc.
catabolic pathway
The process for taking large
complex organic molecules and breaking them down
into smaller ones, which release energy that can be
used for metabolic processes.
catabolism
Reactions involving the breaking down
of organic SUBSTRATES, typically by oxidative break-
down, to provide chemically available energy (e.g.,
adenosine triphosphate [ATP]) and/or to generate
metabolic intermediates.
catabolite
A naturally occurring METABOLITE.
catabolite activator protein (CAP)
A protein that
binds cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), a regu-
latory molecule, to DNA in organisms. When this inter-
action takes place, the gene promoter is made
accessible to the enzyme RNA polymerase, and tran-
scription of the gene can begin.
catalase
A HEME protein that catalyzes the DISPRO-
PORTIONATION of dihydrogen peroxide to O2 and
water. It also catalyzes the oxidation of other com-
pounds, such as ethanol, by dihydrogen peroxide. A
nonheme protein containing a dinuclear manganese
CLUSTER with catalase activity is often called pseudo-
catalase.
catalyst
Any substance that speeds up a chemical
reaction without itself being consumed by the reaction.
catalytic antibody (abzyme)
An ANTIBODY that cat-
alyzes a chemical reaction analogous to an enzymatic
reaction, such as an ester hydrolysis. It is obtained by
using a hapten that mimics the transition state of the
reaction.
See also ENZYME.
cataract
The clouding of the natural lens of the eye
or surrounding membrane, making it difficult to see.
catecholamine
A class of hormones, two of which
are known to be important in a medical emergency.
These are epinephrine and norepinephrine. Dopamine
and dopa are
also catecholamines. All the cate-
cholamines stimulate high blood pressure and can trig-
ger symptoms usually associated with threatening
situations leading to a panic attack.
Epinephrine (adrenaline). A hormone released by
the adrenal gland, which is the drug of choice for the
treatment of anaphylaxis. Indeed, those who are aller-
gic to insect stings and certain foods should always
carry a self-injecting syringe of epinephrine.
Epinephrine increases the speed and force of heart-
beats and, therefore, the work that can be done by the
heart. It dilates the airways to improve breathing and
narrows blood vessels in the skin and intestine so that
an increased flow of blood reaches the muscles and
allows them to cope with the demands of exercise. Usu-
ally treatment with this hormone stops an anaphylactic
reaction. Epinephrine has been produced synthetically
as a drug since 1900.
Norepinephrine (noradrenaline). A hormone released
by the adrenal gland. Norepinephrine is released, along
with epinephrine, from the adrenals and from nerves
when heart failure takes place. These hormones are the
first line of defense during any sudden stress. The
release of these hormones cause the heart to pump
faster, making up for the pumping problem caused by
heart failure.

celiac disease (celiac sprue)
Celiac disease is a mal-
absorption disorder characterized by a permanent
gluten-sensitive enteropathy resulting in malabsorption,
failure to thrive, and other gastrointestinal manifesta-
tions. However, it should not be confused with a food
allergy or hypersensitivity to food products.
Celiac disease is an inherited cell-mediated hyper-
sensitivity involving a tissue-bound immune cell, often
resulting in delayed reaction to a food allergen such as
wheat, rye, oats, or barley. Gluten, a protein in these
grains, is thought to be the offending agent. The disease
has also been referred to as gluten enteropathy, gluten
intolerance, gluten intolerant enteropathy, gluten-sensi-
tive enteropathy, nontropical sprue, and wheat allergy.
The onset of the disease has no age restriction, but
there are many hypotheses related to possible causative
factors. In some adults, symptoms leading to a diagno-
sis of celiac sprue have been observed to appear follow-
ing severe emotional stress, pregnancy, an operation, or
a viral infection.
cell
The basic unit of life, capable of growing and
multiplying. All living things are either single, indepen-
dent cells or aggregates of cells. A cell is usually com-
posed of cytoplasm and a nucleus, and it is surrounded
by a membrane or wall. Cells can be categorized by the
presence of specific cell surface markers called clusters
of differentiation.

cell: the orderly sequence of events (M, G1, S, and G2
phases) when a cell duplicates its contents and divides
into two.
See also CELL-CYCLE PHASES; MITOSIS.
cell-cycle phases
The sequence of events that cells
go through between mitotic divisions. The cycle is
divided into gap 0 (G0), gap 1 (G1), synthesis phase (S)
when DNA is replicated, Gap 2 (G2), and mitosis (M).
G0 phase
Period of time when the cell pauses in cell
division between M (mitosis) and S (synthesis) phas-
es. Normal cells in this phase have exactly one set of
chromosome pairs.
G1 phase
Period of time after mitosis but before S
phase of the cell-division cycle; the cell is making
preparations for DNA synthesis.
G2 phase
Period of time after the S phase and before
mitosis of the cell-division cycle. In this phase, the cells
have duplicated their DNA and formed two sets of
chromosome pairs, in preparation for division. G2 fol-
lows the S phase and precedes the M (mitosis) phase.
See also MITOSIS.
cell division
When two daughter cells are created
from one cell.

developing into their destined specific forms and func-
tions as an organism develops; a result of gene expres-
sion. The process by which different cells, all sharing the
same DNA, are capable of performing different tasks.

The process in which adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) is created by metabolizing glucose
and oxygen with the release of carbon dioxide. Occurs
in the mitochondria of eukaryotes and in the cytoplasm
of prokaryotes.
See also ATP.
cellulose
A polysaccharide (polymer of glucose) that
is found in the cell walls of plants. A fiber that is used
in many commercial products like paper.
cell wall
A tough surrounding layer of a cell. In
plant cells, it is formed of cellulose embedded in a
polysaccharide-protein matrix and is composed of pri-
mary and secondary cell walls: the primary is flexible,
while the secondary is more rigid. The cell wall pro-
vides structural support and protection.
Celsius, Anders (1701–1744) Swedish Astronomer,
Physicist
Anders Celsius was a Swedish astronomer,
physicist, and mathematician who introduced the Cel-
sius temperature scale that is used today by scientists in
most countries. He was born in Uppsala, Sweden, a
city that has produced six Nobel Prize winners. Celsius
was born into a family of scientists, all originating
from the province of Hälsingland. His father Nils Cel-
sius was a professor of astronomy, as was his grandfa-
ther Anders Spole. His other grandfather, Magnus
Celsius, was a professor of mathematics. Both grandfa-
thers were at the university in Uppsala. Several of his
uncles were also scientists.
Celsius’s important contributions include determin-
ing the shape and size of the Earth; gauging the magni-
tude of the stars in the constellation Aries; publication
of a catalog of 300 stars and their magnitudes; obser-
vations on eclipses and other astronomical events; and
a study revealing that the Nordic countries were slowly
rising above the sea level of the Baltic. His most famous
contribution falls in the area of temperature, and the
one he is remembered most for is the creation of the
Celsius temperature scale.
In 1742 he presented to the Swedish Academy of Sci-
ences his paper, “Observations on Two Persistent Degrees
on a Thermometer,” in which he presented his observa-
tions that all thermometers should be made on a fixed
scale of 100 divisions (centigrade) based on two points:
0° for boiling water, and 100° for freezing water. He pre-
sented his argument on the inaccuracies of existing scales
and calibration methods and correctly presented the
influence of air pressure on the boiling point of water.
After his death, the scale that he designed was
reversed, giving rise to the existing 0° for freezing and
100° for boiling water, instead of the reverse. It is not
known if this reversal was done by his student Martin
Stromer; or by botanist Carolus Linnaeus, who in 1745
reportedly showed the senate at Uppsala University a
thermometer so calibrated; or if it was done by Daniel
Ekström, who manufactured most of the thermometers

used by both Celsius and Linneaus. However, Jean
Christin from France made a centigrade thermometer
with the current calibrations (0° freezing, 100° boiling)
a year after Celsius and independent of him, and so he
may therefore equally claim credit for the existing
“Celsius” thermometers.
For years Celsius thermometers were referred to as
“centigrade” thermometers. However, in 1948, the
Ninth General Conference of Weights and Measures
ruled that “degrees centigrade” would be referred to as
“degrees Celsius” in his honor. The Celsius scale is still
used today by most scientists.
Anders Celsius was secretary of the oldest Swedish
scientific society, the Royal Society of Sciences in Upp-
sala, between 1725–44 and published much of his
work through that organization, including a math
book for youth in 1741. He died of tuberculosis on
April 25, 1744, in Uppsala.
Celsius scale (centigrade scale)
A temperature scale
with the range denoted by °C. The normal freezing
point of water is 0°C, and the normal boiling point of
water is 100°C. The scale was named after Anders Cel-
sius, who proposed it in 1742 but designated the freez-
ing point to be 100 and the boiling point to be 0
(reversed after his death).

the human cerebral cortex (the outer, heavily folded, grey matter of
the brain). Neurons exist in varying sizes and shapes throughout
the nervous system, but all have a similar basic structure: a large
central cell body (large, light-gray bodies) containing a nucleus
and two types of processes. These are a single axon (a nerve fiber),
which is the effector part of the cell that terminates on other neu-
rons (or organs), and one or more dendrites, smaller processes that
act as sensory receptors. Similar types of neurons are arranged in
layers within the cerebral cortex. Magnification: ×3,000 at 8 × 8 in.

most complex part of the mammalian brain. The cortex
is broken up into five lobes, each separated by an
indentation called a fissure: the frontal lobe, the pari-
etal lobe, the temporal lobe, the occipital lobe, and the
insula. It is composed of six layers that have different
densities and neuron types from the outermost to
innermost: molecular layer, external granular layer,
external pyramidal layer, internal granular layer, inter-
nal pyramidal layer, and the multiform layer. Vertical
columns of neurons run through the layers.

Chain, Ernst Boris (1906–1979) German Biochemist
Ernst Boris Chain was born on June 19, 1906, in
Berlin, to Dr. Michael Chain, a chemist and industrial-
ist. He was educated at the Luisen gymnasium, Berlin,
with an interest in chemistry. He attended the
Friedrich-Wilhelm University, Berlin, and graduated in
chemistry in 1930. After graduation he worked for
three years at the Charité Hospital, Berlin, on enzyme
research. In 1933, after the rise of the Nazi regime in
Germany, he left for England.
In 1935 he was invited to Oxford University, and
in 1936 he became a demonstrator and lecturer in
chemical pathology. In 1948 he was appointed scientif-
ic director of the International Research Centre for
Chemical Microbiology at the Istituto Superiore di San-
ità, Rome. He became professor of biochemistry at
Imperial College, University of London, in 1961, serv-
ing in that position until 1973. Later, he became a pro-
fessor emeritus and a senior research fellow (1973–76)
and a fellow (1978–79).
From 1935 to 1939 he worked on snake venoms,
tumor metabolism, the mechanism of lysozyme action,
and the invention and development of methods for
biochemical microanalysis. In 1939 he began a system-
atic study of antibacterial substances produced by
microorganisms and the reinvestigation of penicillin.
Later he worked on the isolation and elucidation of
the chemical structure of penicillin and other natural
antibiotics.
With pathologist Howard Walter FLOREY (later
Baron Florey), he isolated and purified penicillin and
performed the first clinical trials of the antibiotic. For
their pioneering work on penicillin Chain, Florey, and
FLEMING shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine.
Later his research topics included the carbohydrate–
amino acid relationship in nervous tissue, a study of
the mode of action of insulin, fermentation technology,
6-aminopenicillanic acid and penicillinase-stable peni-
cillins, lysergic acid production in submerged culture,
and the isolation of new fungal metabolites.
Chain was the author of many scientific papers and
a contributor to important monographs on penicillin
and antibiotics, and was the recipient of many awards
including being knighted in 1969. He died on August
12, 1979.

A chromosome is one of the threadlike “packages” of genes and other DNA in the nucleus of a cell. Different kinds of organisms have
different numbers of chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 46 in all: 44 autosomes and two sex chromosomes. Each 
parent contributes one chromosome to each pair, so children get half of their chromosomes from their mothers and half from their
fathers. (Courtesy of Darryl Leja, NHGRI, National Institutes of Health)

Human Cytogenetics: Historical Overview
and Latest Developments
by Betty Harrison
Cytogenetics, the study of chromosomes, was revolution-
ized by the discovery that quinicrine staining under ultravio-
let light produces a unique banding pattern. In 1970, Dr.
Torbjorn O. Caspersson and his group discovered that
human chromosomes fluoresce when stained with quini-
crine mustard, giving a distinct banding pattern to each
chromosome pair. It was later found that chromosomes
show a similar banding pattern with the use of stain. 
Giemsa/Trypsin or Wright’s/Trypsin stain is now preferable
to quinicrine, as they allow the use of the light microscope
and also provide stable preparations.
Banding of chromosomes allows pairing of, rather than
grouping of, homologous chromosomes of similar size. The
number of bands identified is routinely between 450 and
550, and high resolution is 550 and higher bands in a haploid
set. A band is a region that is distinguishable from a neigh-
boring region by the difference in its staining intensity.
Banding permits a more detailed analysis of chromosome
rearrangements such as translocations, deletions, duplica-
tions, insertions, and inversions.
Several types of banding procedures have been devel-
oped since the early 1970s in addition to Giemsa banding. R-
banding or reverse banding is the opposite of Giemsa
(Wright’s) banding pattern. There are staining techniques
for specific regions of the chromosomes: silver staining,
which stains the nucleolus-organizing regions (NORs), and
C-banding (constitutive heterochromatin), which stains the
centromere of all chromosomes and the distal portion of the
Y chromosome. The size of the C-band on a given chromo-
some is usually constant in all cells of an individual but is
highly variable from person to person.
The development of banding techniques in the early
1970s was followed by the development of “high resolution
banding” in the late 1970s. This technique divides the
landmark bands into sub-bands of contrasting shades of
light and dark regions. High-resolution or extended 
banding is produced by a combination of the induction of
cell synchronization followed by the precise timing of 
harvesting. The cells are then examined in prophase,
prometaphase, and early metaphase. At these stages of
cell division, very small chromosome changes can be
detected. This is useful clinically to find previously 
undetected chromosome aberrations not found at lower
banding levels, to localize breakpoints in rearranged chro-
mosomes, and to help establish phenotype–genotype rela-
tionships at a more precise level.
The normal chromosome complement of 46 is called
diploid. If there are 46 chromosomes with structural abnor-
malities, it is referred to as pseudodiploid. Numerical abnor-
malities are called aneuploidy. When there are more than
46, it is called hyperdiploid, and when fewer, it is called
hypodiploid. Chromosome loss in whole or part is a mono-
somy, while the gain of a single chromosome when they are
paired is a trisomy. The presence of two or more cell lines
in an individual is known as mosaicism. When, for example,
the abnormal line is a trisomy with a normal line, the overall
phenotypic effect of the extra chromosome is generally
decreased.
The types of cells examined are usually from peripher-
al blood, bone marrow, amniotic fluid, chorionic villi, and
solid-tissue biopsies. These tissues are analyzed in diag-
nostic procedures in prenatal diagnosis, multiple miscar-
riages, newborns and children with abnormal phenotypes
and abnormal sexual development, hematological disor-
ders, and solid tumors. Autosomal chromosome abnormali-
ties generally have more serious consequences than sex
chromosome abnormalities. Chromosome abnormalities are
a major cause of fetal loss. These numbers decrease by
birth, and since some trisomies result in early death, their
frequency is lower in children and even lower in adults. 
Numerical changes are the most common chromo-
some abnormalities. Most numerical changes are the result
of nondisjunction in the first meiotic division. Mitotic
nondisjunction typically results in mosaicism. Chromosome
structural changes can be balanced or unbalanced. Struc-
tural abnormalities may be losses, rearrangements, or
gains, while numerical abnormalities are losses or gains.
Both numerical and structural changes may result in pheno-
typic abnormalities.
Chromosome abnormalities may be constitutional or
acquired. Constitutional abnormalities may be associated 
with phenotypic anomalies (i.e., Down’s syndrome, Turner syn-
drome) or result in a normal phenotype (i.e., balanced familial
translocation). Acquired abnormalities are usually those asso-
ciated with malignant transformation, such as cancers.
A significant advance in the past decade has been the
addition of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or molec-
ular cytogenetics. FISH has become both a diagnostic and a
research tool in cytogenetic laboratories. These procedures
involve the denaturation of DNA followed by hybridization
with a specific probe that has been tagged with a fluo-
rochrome and stained with a counterstain. These prepara-
tions are viewed through a fluorescent microscope with a
100-W mercury lamp and appropriate filter sets.

microtubules, and it is anchored by a basal body. 
Single-cell organisms, such as protozoa, use them 
for locomotion. The human female fallopian tubes 
use cilia to transport the egg from the ovary to the
uterus.

FISH, for example, provides rapid results in prenatal
diagnosis. Chromosome analysis using classical chromo-
some analysis on cultured cells from amniotic fluid takes
1–2 weeks to complete. FISH is performed on the uncul-
tured amniocytes and is complete in 24–48 hours. FISH
screens for only numerical abnormalities in chromosomes
13, 18, 21, X, and Y. However, these chromosomes make up
approximately 90 percent of the total chromosome abnor-
malities that result in birth defects.
FISH can be used for identification of marker chromo-
somes, microdeletion syndromes, rearrangements and 
deletions, detection of abnormalities in leukemia, myelopro-
liferative disorders, and solid tumors. For example, a 
chromosome deletion not clearly visible with standard chro-
mosome analysis may be detected with a specific probe for
the region (i.e., Di George syndrome).
Cytogenetic analysis of malignant cells proved valu-
able in the diagnosis and in some cases prognosis of hema-
tological malignancies. FISH has increased the importance
of chromosome analysis in the diagnosis of these patients.
Many nonrandom cytogenetic abnormalities associated
with a specific hematological malignancy have been found.
These findings have contributed to the understanding and in
some cases treatment of these malignancies. The use of
FISH techniques has greatly improved the diagnostic accu-
racy because, in addition to specific translocation probes,
FISH can detect abnormalities in both interphase and
metaphase cells.
A current FISH test that may be used for the identifica-
tion of subtle rearrangements or to characterize complex
translocations involving more than two chromosomes is
spectral karyotyping (M-FISH, or multiplex in-situ hybridiza-
tion). This test simultaneously identifies entire chromo-
somes using 24 different colors.
Recent research using telomere probes in cases 
of unexplained mental retardation has revealed that
approximately 6 percent may be due to subtelomere 
rearrangements.
An additional research tool, especially in cancer cyto-
genetics, is comparative genomic hybridization (CGH). This
technique reveals whole chromosome gains and losses as
well as deletions and amplifications of very small chromo-
some segments. Cytogenetic analysis has been an extreme-
ly valuable tool for screening and for diagnosing genetic
disorders, and it will continue to play a vital role in medical
service and research.

circadian rhythm
A biological process that oscil-
lates with an approximate 24-hour periodicity, even if
there are no external timing cues; an internal daily bio-
logical clock present in all eukaryotes.
circular dichroism (CD)
A spectroscopic method
that measures the difference in absorbance of left- and
right-handed circularly polarized light by a material as
a
function of the wavelength. Most biological
molecules, including proteins and NUCLEIC ACIDS, are
CHIRAL and show circular dichroism in their ultraviolet
absorption bands, which can be used as an indication
of SECONDARY
STRUCTURE. Metal centers that are
bound to such molecules, even if they have no inherent
chirality, usually exhibit CD in absorption bands asso-
ciated with LIGAND-based or ligand-metal CHARGE-
TRANSFER
TRANSITIONs. CD is frequently used in
combination with absorption and MCD studies to
assign electronic transitions.
cis
In inorganic nomenclature, cis is a structural
prefix designating two groups occupying adjacent
positions. (The term is not generally recommended 
for precise nomenclature purposes of complicated 
systems.)
See also TRANS.
cisplatin
cis-Diamminedichloroplatinum(II). An anti-
tumor drug highly effective in the chemotherapy of
many forms of cancer. Of major importance in the anti-
tumor activity of this drug is its interaction with the
NUCLEIC ACID bases of DNA.
cistron
A segment of DNA that codes for a single
polypeptide domain; another name for a gene.
cladistics
A way to classify organisms by common
ancestry, based on the branching of the evolutionary
family tree. Organisms that share a common ancestor
and have similar features are put into groups called
clades. At each diverging line, there are two branching
lines of descendants, and evolution plays a role in
future changes in characteristics.
cladogenesis
The evolutionary splitting of lineages;
one or more new species comes from an existing 
parent species, i.e., speciation. Also called branching
evolution.
cladogram
A pictorial representation of a branching
tree that depicts species divergence from a common
ancestry.
class
The taxonomic ranking of plants and animals
that is between phylum and order.
See also TAXON.
classical conditioning
The presentation of two
stimuli at the same point in time: a neutral stimulus
and a conditioned stimulus; the changes in behavior
arising from the presentation of one stimulus in 
the presence of another. The pairing leads to the 
neutral stimulus associating with the properties of 
the conditioned.
cleavage
The process of cell division in an early
embryo. Initial stages in embryonic development where
the zygote converts to a ball of cells through divisions
of clearly marked blastomeres, usually from a succes-
sion from first through sixth cleavages (2–64 cells).
Each species of organism displays a characteristic cleav-
age pattern that can be observed. Cleavage divides the
embryo without increasing its mass.
cleavage furrow
A groove composed of actin-rich
contractile microfilaments that draws in tight to sepa-
rate daughter cells during cytokinesis. Also called the
contractile ring.
cleistogamous

female seeks out the prey or stored food of another
cleptoparasite
69

female, usually of another species, and appropriates it
for the rearing of her own offspring.
climax
The final stage in succession where the con-
stituent species populations fluctuate normally instead
of acting as replacements of other species. The con-
stituent species will self-perpetuate as long as all natu-
ral conditions are favorable and continue.
cline
The establishment of plant populations over a
specific geographic range that have adapted to different
locations and have become slightly different from one
another. The plants show a gradient of change over the
range, with the frequency of a particular gene either
increasing or decreasing over the range. Under the right
conditions, speciation may occur over time.

tive, excretory, and reproductive tract for most verte-
brates, with the exception of the majority of mammals.

lymphocytes of a particular specificity is due to contact
with either “self” or an artificially introduced antigen.
70
climax
The faces of identical “Megan” and “Morag,” the world’s first cloned sheep aged 9 months. These Welsh mountain sheep were the prod-
uct of research by Dr. Ian Wilmut and colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland. The research involved culturing identical
embryonic cells from sheep to produce a  “cell line.” Next, a sheep egg cell had its DNA removed, and one of these embryonic cells was
implanted into the egg. A spark of electricity then stimulated the egg to grow into a lamb, nourished in the womb of a surrogate sheep.
The ability to clone farm animals, first achieved in 1996, may provide benefits to agriculture and biotechnology. (Courtesy © James King-

clonal selection theory (Burnett theory)
Clonal
selection theory states that the specificity and diversity
of an immune response are the result of selection by an
antigen of specifically reactive clones from a large
repertoire of preformed lymphocytes, each with indi-
vidual specificities.
clone
A population of organisms, cells, viruses, or
DNA molecules that is derived from the replication of
a single genetic progenitor. In the case of B cells, each
B cell has a typical Ig, and so all the cells that
descend from one B cell (the clone) have the same Ig.
Typically, a cancer is a clone of cells. Sometimes,
clone is also used to refer to a number of recombi-
nant DNA molecules all carrying the same inserted
SEQUENCE.
cloning vector
Any organism or agent (virus, plas-
mid) that is used to introduce foreign DNA into host
cells.
closed circulatory system
A type of circulatory sys-
tem where the blood is contained within a system of
vessels and the heart; blood vessels carry blood through
all the organs.
cluster
A number of metal centers grouped closely
together that can have direct metal-bonding interac-
tions or interactions through a BRIDGING LIGAND, but
are not necessarily held together by these interactions.
Examples can be found under the entries [2FE-2S], 
[4FE-4S], FERREDOXIN,

clusters of differentiation (CD)
Cluster of antigens,
with which antibodies react, that characterize a cell
surface marker.
Lymphocytes can be divided into subsets either by
their functions or by surface markers. The availability
of monoclonal Abs raised against lymphocytes has
allowed for the demonstration of several lymphocyte
subsets, which express a combination of certain
molecules on their surfaces. These surface markers have
been designated clusters of differentiation (CD).
Already, 78 CDs have been identified as well as the
monoclonal Abs used to define them, their molecular
weights, and cellular distribution. For example, CD23,
the receptor for the FC portion of IgE and CD8 (T8), a
protein embedded in the cell surface of suppressor T
lymphocytes.
CD4
One of the most infamous CDs due to 
its importance in AIDS. CD4 (T4) is the protein
embedded on the surface of T helper and other white 
blood cells to which HIV attaches itself. It is also
found to a lesser degree on the surface of monocytes/
macrophages, Langerhans cells, astrocytes, ker-

ing itself to the CD4 molecule (CD4 receptor). The
number of T4 cells in a blood sample is used to mea-
sure the health of the immune system in people with
HIV.
Helper T cell (CD4 cell, helper, helper cell, 
T helper cell, T helper lymphocyte, T4 cell)
A subset
of T cells that carry the T4 marker and are essential
for turning on antibody production, activating cyto-
toxic T cells, and initiating other immune responses.
The number of T4 cells in a blood sample is used to
measure the health of the immune system in people
with HIV. T helper lymphocytes contain two subsets,
TH1 and TH2 cells.
CD8 cell (T suppressor cell, T8 cell)
The exis-
tence of these cells is a relatively recent discovery, and
hence their functioning is still somewhat debated. The
basic concept of suppressor T cells is a cell type that
specifically suppresses the action of other cells in the
immune system, notably B cells and T cells, thereby
preventing the establishment of an immune response.
How this is done is not known with certainty, but it
seems that certain specific antigens can stimulate the
activation of the suppressor T cells. Discrete epitopes
have been found that display suppressor activity on
killer T cells, T helper cells, and B cells. This suppres-
sor effect is thought to be mediated by some inhibitory
factor secreted by suppressor T cells. It is not any of the
known lymphokines. A fact that renders the study of
this cell type difficult is the lack of a specific surface
marker. Most suppressor T cells are CD8 positive, as
are cytotoxic T cells.

cobalamin (vitamin B12)
A vitamin synthesized by
microorganisms and conserved in animals in the liver.
Deficiency of vitamin B12 leads to pernicious ANEMIA.
Cobalamin is a substituted CORRIN-Co(III) complex
in which the cobalt atom is bound to the four nitro-
gen atoms of the corrin ring, an axial group R and
5,6-dimethylbenzimidazole. The latter is linked to the
cobalt by the N-3 nitrogen atom and is bound to the
C-1 carbon of a ribose molecule by the N-1 nitrogen
atom. Various forms of the vitamin are known with
different R groups, such as R=CN, cyanocobalamin;
R=OH, hydroxocobalamin; R=CH3, methylcobalamin;
R=adenosyl, COENZYME B12.
cochlea
The inner ear; a circular or coiled snaillike
shell that contains a system of liquid-filled tubes with
tiny hair cells. Sound signals pass from the cochlea via
the oscillating hair cells, which transform them into
electrical signals along the auditory nerve to the brain
stem, where they activate other nerves in the brain.
cockroach
The order Blattodea that contains the
insects also known as the “cucaracha,” black beetle,
water bug, Yankee settler, shiner, and a host of other
names; it is one of the most hated insects known to
man. There are 4,000 species, but only about 12 are
commonly associated with humans. Common species
include: Blatella germanica, Blatta orientalis, Periplane-

Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of a vertical section through part of the cochlea inside a human ear. The section shows part of the
row of columnar outer pillar cells that runs along the organ of Corti, the auditory sense organ. The outer pillar cells arise from the basilar
membrane (across bottom), and their upper surfaces (across top) form part of the surface of the organ of Corti. This organ lies on the basi-
lar membrane, an internal surface of the cochlear duct. The organ of Corti also contains hairlike cilia (not seen) and an overlying tectori-
al membrane (removed). Sound waves deform hairlike cilia and trigger auditory nerve impulses. Magnification: ×600 at 6 × 7 cm size.

coefficient of kinship
The kinship coefficient
expresses the chance of finding common genes on the
same locus. It also expresses the probability that alleles
drawn randomly from each of two individuals are iden-
tical by descent. It is also the relationship between a
pair of individuals.
coefficient of variation
A measure of dispersion
around the mean (average).
coelacanth
A
400-million-year-old “living fossil,”
believed to have gone extinct 65 million years ago dur-
ing the Cretaceous period and predating the dinosaurs
by millions of years. The coelacanth was found alive in
1938 in South Africa. Today, Latimeria chalumnae and
Latimeria menadoensis represent a once widespread

coevolution
The evolution of two species where the
evolutionary changes in one of the species influences
the evolution of the other. A classic example is the
long, narrow bill of the hummingbird. It has coevolved
with tubular flowers, and the adaptation of its bill
allows it to feed on plants with long, tubular flowers.
These flowers in turn have adapted (coevolved) for fer-
tilization by the hummingbirds when they take their
nectar.

The taxonomic order that comprises
the insect group of beetles, one of the most adaptable
and numerous insect groups. Beetles go through com-
plete metamorphosis, have their hind wings covered
by their fore wings, and are found in a variety of
habitats.
collagen
The most abundant fibrous protein in the
human body (about 30 percent) and in the animal
kingdom; shapes the structure of tendons, bones, and
connective tissues. There are several types (I, II, III, IV)
that are found in bone, skin, tendons, cartilage, embry-
onic tissues, and basement membranes.
collecting duct
The area in the kidneys where urine
is collected. Distal tubules of several nephrons join to
form the collecting duct, which consists of the arcuate
renal tubule, straight collecting tubule, and the papil-
lary duct. Also known as the tubulus renalis colligens,
or renal collecting tubule.

insects that are wingless and can jump remarkable
distances.
collenchyma cell
One of the three major plant cell
types (dermal, ground, and vascular). Collenchyma
cells are part of the ground tissue (ground tissues
include parenchyma, collenchyma, and sclerenchyma
cells) and are elongated and thick, with uneven cell

colony-stimulating factor
(CSF )
The category
includes granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-
CSF), macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF),
and granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor
(GM-CSF).
These are all cytokine proteins that stimu-
late growth and reproduction of certain kinds of blood
cells in the bone marrow. Also referred to as growth
factors. The production of white blood cells is con-
trolled 
by 
colony-stimulating 
factors. 
Cancer
chemotherapy and inherited disorders are among the
causes of low white-cell counts, which lower resistance
to infection. Thus, CSFs are being investigated not only
as a way to counteract low white-cell counts but also
as a way to produce specific types of white blood cells.
In addition, there is hope that CSFs can stimulate the
body to produce additional bone marrow as well as
cause some cancer cells to stop dividing.

competitive exclusion principle (Gause’s law)
The
condition where one species is driven out of a commu-
nity by extinction due to interspecific competition; one
species will dominate the use of resources and have a
reproductive advantage, forcing the other to disappear.
competitive inhibitor
A substance that resembles
the substrate for an enzyme, both in shape and size,
and competes with the substrate for the substrate bind-
ing site on the enzyme, thereby reducing the rate of
reaction by reducing the number of enzyme molecules
that successfully bind.

using the enzyme reverse transcriptase. However, the
cDNA does not include introns, those portions of the
DNA that were spliced out while still in the cell. Used
for research purposes and can be cloned into plasmids
for storage.
complement fixation
The consumption of comple-
ment, a complex of nine blood serum proteins that
interact sequentially with specific antibodies (and con-
centrates in inflamed regions), by an antibody-antigen
reaction containing complement-fixing antibodies.

blood serum in the form of components, factors, or
other regulators that work at the surface of cells as
receptors. Inactive until activated by immune respons-
es, the system acts to dissolve and remove immune
complexes and kill foreign cells.
complete digestive tract (alimentary canal)
A tube
that has an opening and end (mouth and anus) that is
used in digestion. The complete digestive tract is one
where food is ingested at one end of the tract, the
mouth, and wastes from digestion are passed out of the
tract at the other end, the anus. An incomplete diges-
tive tract has just one opening used both to take in
food and to eliminate wastes.
complete flower
Any flower that has all four major
parts: SEPALS, PETALS, STAMENS, and CARPELS.
Compositae (Asteraceae)
The 
composites 
(also
known as the daisy or sunflower family), Compositae
or Asteraceae, are one of the largest plant families,
containing almost 20,000 species. Most of these
species are herbs, but there are also some shrubs, trees,
and vines. The family includes many edible salad
plants (e.g., lettuce, endive, chicory, and artichoke);
cultivated species such as the marigolds, daisies, sun-
flowers, and chrysanthemums; as well as many com-
mon weeds and wildflowers. It is primarily the latter,
for example, ragweed and mugwort, that are involved
in pollen-induced seasonal allergies.
Ragweed (Ambrosia)
Ragweed refers to the group of approximately 15
species of weed plants, belonging to the Compositae
family. Most ragweed species are native to North
America, although they are also found in Eastern
Europe and the French Rhône Valley. The ragweeds
are annuals characterized by their rough, hairy stems
and mostly lobed or divided leaves. The ragweed
flowers are greenish and inconspicuously concealed
in small heads on the leaves. The ragweed species,
whose copious pollen is the main cause of seasonal
allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in eastern and middle
North America, are the common ragweed (A.
artemisiifolia) and the great, or giant, ragweed (A.
trifida). The common ragweed grows to about 1 meter
(3.5 feet); is common all across North America; and
is also commonly referred to as Roman wormwood,
hogweed, hogbrake or bitterweed. The giant rag-
weed, meanwhile, can reach anywhere up to 5 meters
Compositae

(17 feet) in height and is native from Quebec to
British Columbia in Canada and southward to Flori-
da, Arkansas, and California in the United States.
Due to the fact that ragweeds are annuals, they can
be eradicated simply by mowing them before they
release their pollen in late summer.

A. maritima, A. austriaca, A. pontica, A. laciniata, 
A. abrotanum, A. annua, A. tilessii)
A shrubby weed
most commonly found on wasteland, mugwort can
reach heights of up to 2 meters (7 feet) and is charac-
terized by quite small, yellow to reddish brown flowers
and a woody stem. The mugwort pollen season (in cen-
tral Europe) is generally late July to September, with a
peak around mid-August. Mugwort is known to cross-
react with almost all members of the Compositae fami-
ly, especially the ragweeds, as well as dandelions,
sunflowers, chamomille, and all daisylike flowers.
Mugwort also displays an important cross-reaction in
the context of food allergies to celery.
compound
The combination of two or more dif-
ferent elements, held together by chemical bonds. The
elements in a given compound are always combined
in the same proportion by mass (law of definite 
proportion).
compound eye
A multifaceted eye found in most
invertebrates. The eye is composed of many separate
cylinder-shaped (hexagonal) units called ommatidia.
Each ommatidium has its own surface area, lens (crys-
talline cone), light receptors (retinulae), and optic nerve
fiber. The images from the collection of ommatidia are
then processed.
comproportionation
Describes a chemical reaction
when a mixture of species in different oxidation states
reacts to produce a product that is in a different but
more stable intermediate oxidation state. A type of
redox reaction. For example, when iodide ions and

of insects, although the size, shape, and number of facets vary among species. The dragonfly, with 30,000 facets, has the largest insect eye.
Each ommatidia is a light-sensitive unit consisting of a lens immediately behind the cuticular surface and light-sensitive cells. Light stim-
ulating these cells is converted into electrical signals that are passed to the brain. The insect sees a mosaic image made up from separate
bits of information entering each ommatidia. Magnification: ×55 at 35-mm size, ×110 at 6 × 7-cm size. (Courtesy © John Walsh/Photo

concanavalin A
A protein from jack beans, contain-
ing calcium and manganese, that agglutinates red blood
cells and stimulates T lymphocytes to undergo mitosis.
condensation reaction (dehydration reaction)
A
(usually stepwise) reaction in which two or more reac-
tants (or remote reactive sites within the same molecu-
lar 
entity) 
yield 
a 
single 
main 
product 
with
accompanying formation of water or of some other
small molecule, e.g., ammonia, ethanol, acetic acid,
hydrogen sulfide.
The mechanism of many condensation reactions
has been shown to comprise consecutive addition and
elimination reactions, as in the base-catalyzed forma-
tion of (E)-but-2-enal (crotonaldehyde) from acetalde-
hyde via 3-hydroxybutanal (aldol). The overall reaction
in this example is known as the aldol condensation.
The term is sometimes also applied to cases where
the formation of water or another simple molecule does
not occur.
cone cell
A photoreceptor cell of the eye that is
found in the retina and densely populates the central
portion, called the macula. It is responsible for seeing
color and fine visual detail.
See also ROD CELL.
confidence limits
A statistical parameter defining
the lower and upper boundaries/values of a confidence
interval. A range of values that is estimated from a
sample group that is highly likely to include the true,
although unknown, value.
configuration
In the context of stereochemistry, the
term is restricted to the arrangement of atoms of a
molecular entity in space that distinguishes the entity as
a STEREOISOMER, the isomerism of which is not due to
CONFORMATION differences.
conformation
A spatial three-dimensional arrange-
ment of atoms in a molecule that can rotate without
breaking any bonds.
congener
A substance—literally con- (with) generat-
ed—synthesized by essentially the same synthetic chem-
ical reactions and the same procedures. An ANALOG is a
substance that is analogous in some respect to the pro-
totype agent in chemical structure.
The term congener, while most often a synonym
for homologue, has become somewhat more diffuse in
meaning, so that the terms congener and analog are fre-
quently used interchangeably in the literature.
conidium
A nonmotile asexual spore borne at the tip
of a special hyphal branch called a conidiophore. It is
diverse in form: single or multicelled; simple or com-
plex; round, elongated, or spiral shaped. It is found in
ascomycetes and basidiomycetes only.
conifer
A seed-bearing evergreen tree or shrub, a
gymnosperm, that reproduces by the use of cones.
Conifers inhabit cool temperate regions and have
leaves in the form of needles or scales. Examples
include pines, fir, spruce, and hemlock. The gym-
nosperms are the plant order of nonflowering plants,
which are characterized by the fact that their seeds are
exposed to the air during all stages of development.
The name gymnosperm means “naked seeds.” Gym-
nosperms are woody plants and are pollinated by wind,
hence their potential for inducing seasonal allergy. The
seed-bearing structure is typically a cone. Gymnosperm
members include the cycads (e.g., sago palm); ginkgoes;
conifers (order Pinales) (e.g., monkey-puzzle, nutmeg);

The meeting of the North American tectonic plate and the Euro-
pean tectonic plate can be clearly seen near Pingvellir, Iceland,
where ravines and cliffs mark the line of the Atlantic Fault. To the
left of the picture is the eastern edge of the North American 
continental plate; to the right is the western edge of Europe. The
Atlantic Fault cuts across Iceland from northeast (in the distance)
to southwest. The two plates are slowly moving apart by the 
process of continental drift as the Atlantic Ocean widens. This
process causes Iceland’s intense seismic and volcanic activity.

ature gradients; the rising of warm air and the sinking
of cool air. The transfer of heat by circulation or move-
ment of heated liquid or gas.
convergent evolution
When two unrelated species
share similar traits arising from each species indepen-
dently adapting to a similar environmental condition.
cooperativity
The phenomenon that binding of an
effector molecule to a biological system either
enhances or diminishes the binding of a successive
molecule, of the same or different kind, to the same
system. The system may be an ENZYME or a protein
that specifically binds another molecule such as oxy-
gen or DNA. The effector molecule may be an enzyme
SUBSTRATE or an ALLOSTERIC EFFECTOR. The enzyme
or protein exists in different CONFORMATIONs, with
different catalytic rates or binding affinities, and bind-
ing of the effector molecule changes the proportion of
these conformations. Enhanced binding is named posi-
tive cooperativity; diminished binding is named nega-
tive cooperativity. A well-known example of positive
cooperativity is in HEMOGLOBIN. In biocatalysis it was
originally proposed that only multiSUBUNIT enzymes
could respond in this way. However, single-subunit
enzymes may give such a response (so-called mnemon-
ic enzymes).
See also BIOCATALYST.
coordination
A coordination entity is composed of
a CENTRAL ATOM, usually that of a metal, to which is
attached a surrounding array of other atoms or group
of atoms, each of which is called a LIGAND. A coordi-
nation entity can be a neutral molecule, a cation, or
an anion. The ligands can be viewed as neutral or
ionic entities that are bonded to an appropriately
charged central atom. It is standard practice to think
of the ligand atoms that are directly attached to the
central atom as defining a coordination polyhedron
(tetrahedron, square plane, octahedron, etc.) about
the central atom. The coordination number is defined
as being equal to the number of sigma-bonds between
ligands and the central atom. This definition is not
necessarily appropriate in all areas of (coordination)
chemistry. In a coordination formula, the central atom
is listed first. The formally anionic ligands appear
next, and they are listed in alphabetic order according
to the first symbols of their formulas. The neutral lig-
ands follow, also in alphabetic order, according to the
same principle. The formula for the entire coordina-
tion entity, whether charged or not, is enclosed in
square brackets. In a coordination name, the ligands
are listed in alphabetic order, without regard to
charge, before the name of the central atom. Numeri-
cal prefixes indicating the number of ligands are not
considered in determining that order. All anionic 
coordination entities take the ending -ate, whereas no
distinguishing termination is used for cationic or 
neutral coordination entities.
cordilleran
A system of parallel mountain ranges
forming the spine of continents (e.g., Andes in South
America, Rocky Mountains in North America). Span-
ish for mountain range.
Cori, Carl Ferdinand (1896–1984) Austrian Bio-
chemist
Carl Ferdinand Cori was born in Prague on
December 5, 1896, to Carl I. Cori, director of the
Marine Biological Station in Trieste. He studied at the
gymnasium in Trieste and graduated in 1914, when he
entered the German University of Prague to study
medicine. During World War I, he served as a lieu-
tenant in the sanitary corps of the Austrian army on
the Italian front; he returned to the university to gradu-
ate as a doctor of medicine in 1920. He spent a year at

the University of Vienna and a year as assistant in
pharmacology at the University of Graz until, in 1922,
he accepted a position as biochemist at the State Insti-
tute for the Study of Malignant Diseases in Buffalo,
New York. In 1931, he was appointed professor of
pharmacology at the Washington University Medical
School in St. Louis, where he later became professor of
biochemistry.
He married Gerty Theresa CORI (née Radnitz) in
1920. They worked together in Buffalo. When he
moved to St. Louis, she joined him as a research associ-
ate. Gerty Cori was made professor of biochemistry in
1947.
Jointly, they researched the biochemical pathway
by which glycogen, the storage form of sugar in liver
and muscle, is broken down into glucose. They also
determined the molecular defects underlying a number
of genetically determined glycogen-storage diseases.
For these discoveries the Coris received the 1947 Nobel
Prize in physiology or medicine.
They became naturalized Americans in 1928. He
died on October 20, 1984, in Cambridge, Mas-
sachusetts. His wife died earlier, in 1957.

corpus luteum
A
secreting tissue in the ovary,
formed from a collapsed follicle, that produces increas-
ing levels of estrogen as well as progesterone after ovu-
lation. These hormones prepare the endometrium for
the implantation of a fertilized egg. However, if preg-
nancy does not occur, the corpus luteum regresses and
these hormone levels decline. This results in the break-
down of the endometrium and initiates menstrual bleed-
ing. If pregnancy does occur, the corpus luteum begins
to produce human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).
corrin
A ring-contracted PORPHYRIN derivative that is
missing a carbon from one of the mesopositions (C-20).
It constitutes the skeleton C19H22N4 upon which various

cotyledons
Leaflike structures (seed leaves) pro-
duced by the embryo of flowering plants, the dicots
(Magnoliopsida), and the monocots (Liliopsida). They
serve to absorb nutrients in the seed until the seedling
is able to produce true leaves and begin photosynthesis.
In monocots, the embryo has a single cotyledon, while
in dicots, the embryo has two cotyledons.

countercurrent exchange
The effect caused when
two fluids move past each other in opposite directions
and facilitate the efficient exchange of heat, gas, or sub-
stance. For example: the passage of heat from one
blood vessel to another; rete mirabile, the countercur-
rent exchange structure of capillaries that allows gas
uptake in a fish swim bladder; the kidney nephron
loop, a tubular section of nephron between the proxi-
mal and distal convoluted tubules where water is con-
served and urine concentrates by a countercurrent
exchange system; and the upper airway where, upon
expiration, heat and moisture are retained and given up
to relatively cool and dry inspired gases.
Cournand, André-Frédéric (1895–1988) French
Physiologist
André-Frédéric Cournand was born in
Paris on September 24, 1895, to Jules Cournand, a
stomatologist, and his wife Marguérite Weber. He
received his early education at the Lycée Condorcet,
received a bachelor’s degree at the Faculté des Lettres
of the Sorbonne in 1913, and received a diploma of
physics, chemistry, and biology of the Faculté des Sci-
ences the following year.
He began medical studies in 1914, but served in
the French Army from 1915 to 1918, returning to med-
ical studies at the Interne des Hôpitaux de Paris in
1925. He received an M.D. from the Faculté de
Médecine de Paris in May 1930 and secured a residen-
cy in the Tuberculosis (later Chest) Service of the
Columbia University Division at Bellevue Hospital,
New York. He became chief resident of this service and
conducted research on the physiology and phys-
iopathology of respiration under the guidance of Dick-
inson W. RICHARDS. He became an American citizen in
1941 and retired from Columbia in 1964.
Together, Cournand and Richards collaborated in
clinical lung and heart research. They perfected a pro-
cedure introduced by Werner Forssmann and called
Forssmann’s procedure, now called cardiac catheteriza-
tion (a tube is passed into the heart from a vein at the
elbow). This made it possible to study the functioning
of the diseased human heart and to make more accu-
rate diagnoses of the underlying anatomic defects. They
also used the catheter to examine the pulmonary artery,
improving the diagnosis of lung diseases as well. He
shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine with
Dickinson W. Richards and Werner FORSSMANN for
their discoveries concerning heart catheterization and
circulatory changes in 1956.
Cournand served on the editorial boards of many
medical and physiological publications, including Cir-
culation, Physiological Reviews, The American Journal
of Physiology, and also Journal de Physiologie and
Revue Française d’Etúdes Cliniques et Biologiques. He
was a member of numerous scientific organizations and
received awards for his work. He died on February 19,
1988, at Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

term applied to sensory cells within an ear’s semicircular
canal that detect fluid movement. Also means crest, such
as the crista galli, the comb on a rooster.
Croll, James (1821–1890) British Carpenter, Physi-
cist
James Croll was born in Cargill, Perthshire, Scot-
land, on January 2, 1821. He was the son of David
Croll, a stonemason from Little Whitefield, Perthshire,
and Janet Ellis of Elgrin. He received an elementary
school education until he was 13 years old. His knowl-
edge of science was the result of vigilance, since he was
84
cotyledons

self-taught. On September 11, 1848, he married Isabel-
la MacDonald, daughter of John MacDonald.
Croll started his career as a carpenter apprenticed
to a wheelwright when he was young; then he became a
joiner at Banchory and opened a shop in Elgin. In 1852,
he opened a temperance hotel in Blairgowrie, and later,
in 1853, became an insurance agent for the Safety Light
Assurance Company ending up in Leicester.
His first book, The Philosophy of Theism, was
published in 1857 and based on the influence of the
metaphysics of Jonathan Edward. However due to an
injury, he ended up obtaining a job as a janitor at
Anderson’s College and Museum in Glasgow in 1859.
Being a janitor gave him enough free time after his
daily chores to utilize the museum’s extensive library.
There, he would spend the night reading books on
physics, including the works of Joseph A. Adhémar,
the French mathematician, who noted in 1842 that the
Earth’s orbit is elliptical rather than spherical. Adhé-
mar proposed in his book Revolutions de la Mer, Del-
uges Periodics (Revolutions of the sea, periodic floods)
that the precession of the equinoxes produced varia-
tions in the amount of solar radiation striking the
planet’s two hemispheres during the winter time (inso-
lation), and this, along with gravity effects from the
sun and moon on the ice caps, is what produced ice
ages alternately in each hemisphere during a 26,000-
year cycle. Precession is the slow gyration of Earth’s
axis around the pole of the ecliptic, caused mainly by
the gravitational pull of the sun, moon, and other
planets on Earth’s equatorial bulge. Croll also read
about the new calculations of the Earth’s orbit by
French astronomer Urbain Jean Joseph Leverrier (a
discoverer of the planet Neptune).
Croll decided to work on the origins of the ice
ages, since he did not agree with the prevailing attitude
that they were leftover relics from the biblical Great
Flood, and additionally he found errors in Adhémar’s
work. Croll came to the conclusion that the overriding
force changing climate and creating the ice ages on
Earth was due to variations in insolation, which is the
rate of delivery of solar radiation per unit of horizontal
surface, i.e., the sunlight hitting the Earth.
Croll first realized that Adhémar did not take into
account the shape of the Earth’s orbit that varied over
time and its effect on precession, so he calculated the
eccentricity over several million years. This eccentricity
(the distance between the center of an eccentric and its
axis), in this case the degree of Earth’s elliptic orbit, he
proposed, varied on a time scale of about 100,000
years. Since variations in eccentricity only produced
small changes in the annual radiation budget of Earth,
and not enough to force an ice age, Croll developed the
idea of climatic feedbacks, such as changes in surface
albedo (reflection). He predicted that the last ice age
was over about 80,000 years ago.
During the 1860s, he published his theories in a
number of papers: “On the Physical Cause of Changes
of Climate during Geological Epochs” (1864); “The
Eccentricity of the Earth’s Orbit” (1866, 1867); “Geo-
logical Time and Date of Glacial and Miocene Periods”
(1868); “The Physical Cause of the Motion of
Glaciers” (1869, 1870); “The Supposed Greater Loss
of Heat by the Southern Hemisphere” (1869); “Evolu-
tion by Force Impossible: A New Argument against
Materialism” (1877). During this time he was the keep-
er of maps and correspondence at the Scottish Geologi-
cal Survey starting in 1867, where he mingled with
some of the best geologists of the time until he retired
in 1880.
In 1875 he published Climate & Time in Their
Geological Relations,
where
he summed up his
research on the ancient condition of the Earth. On Jan-
uary 6, 1876, he was elected a fellow of the Royal Soci-
ety of London. Charles Darwin was among the many
supporters of his nomination. He received an LL.D.
(law degree) that year from St. Andrews College. While
his main interests were in the field of paleoclimate
change, he also put forth theories about ocean currents
and their effects on climate during modern times.
However, some of his thoughts and ideas were
wrong. For example, Croll believed that ice ages varied
in the hemispheres, and his estimated age for the last
ice advance ending 80,000 to 100,000 years ago was
wrong. It ended between 14,000 and 10,000 years ago,
as research currently shows. Because of these errors,
Croll fell out of vogue until 1912, when Yugoslav geol-
ogist Milutin Milankovitch revised Croll’s theories in
his book, Canon of Insolation.
Croll published close to 90 papers on a variety of
subjects, such as “Ocean Currents” (1870, 1871, 1874);
“Change of Obliquity of Ecliptic: Its Effect on Climate”
(1867); “Physical Cause of Submergence during Glacial
Epoch” (1866, 1874); “Boulder Clay of Caithness &
Glaciation of North Sea” (1870); “Method of Deter-
mining Mean Thickness of Sedimentary Rocks” (1871);
Croll, James
85

and “What Determines Molecular Motion? The Funda-
mental Problem of Nature” (1872).
A famous debate on the nature of deep-sea circula-
tion between Croll and Irish scientist William Carpen-
ter during the 1860s to 1880s was well discussed in the
literature and around scientific circles via correspon-
dence. In 1885, he published Climate and Cosmology
to answer critics of his earlier work Climate & Time in
Their Geological Relation. Five years later, plagued by
ill health his whole life, he died in Perth on December
15, at age 69, shortly after publishing a small book
called The Philosophical Basis of Evolution.
Cro-Magnon
An early group of Homo sapiens
(humans) that lived in Europe around 40,000 years ago.
crossing over
A process during meiosis when alleles
on homologous chromosomes (chromosomes that pair
with each other at meiosis) switch places, increasing the
possible combinations of alleles and thus increasing the
variability of the whole genome. Also called recombi-
nation.
See also RECOMBINANT.
cross-pollination
When pollen from the anther of a
flower of one plant is transferred to the flowers (stig-
ma) of a different plant.
See also POLLINATION.
cross-reactivity
The ability of an immunoglobulin,
specific for one antigen, to react with a second antigen.
A measure of relatedness between two different anti-
genic substances.
Crustacea
All crustaceans have two pairs of anten-
nae, a pair of mandibles, a pair of compound eyes
(usually on stalks), two pair of maxillae on their
heads, and a pair of appendages on each body segment
(head, thorax, and abdomen). There are about 30,000
species of this subphylum within five classes (Remi-
pedia, Cephalocarida, Branchiopoda, Maxillopoda,
and Malacostraca). Includes lobsters, crabs, crayfish,
shrimp, copepods, isopods, barnacles, and others.
Many of them are important economic species for
human consumption.
cryptic
Describes the ability to conceal or camouflage.
cryptic coloration
A camouflage technique whereby
an organism matches its background, concealing itself
from predators or prey, e.g., the peppered moth.
See also MIMICRY.
crystal field
Crystal field theory is the theory that
interprets the properties of COORDINATION entities on
the basis that the interaction of the LIGANDs and the
CENTRAL ATOM is a strictly ionic or ion-dipole interac-
tion resulting from electrostatic attractions between the
central atom and the ligands. The ligands are regarded
as point negative (or partially negative) charges sur-
rounding a central atom; covalent bonding is complete-
ly neglected. The splitting or separation of energy levels
of the five degenerate d-orbitals in a transition metal,
when the metal is surrounded by ligands arranged in a
particular geometry with respect to the metal center, is
called the crystal field splitting.

cuticle
A protective impermeable waxy substance
formed from the polymer cutan that covers the outside
of leaves, stems, and fruits and forms the protective
layer of arthropods.
cyanobacteria
Bacteria, formerly known as blue-
green algae; aquatic and photosynthetic organisms that
live in water and manufacture their own food. Their
fossils go back more than 3.5 billion years, making
them the oldest known species, and they are the con-
tributors to the origin of plants.

cybernetics
The science that studies the methods to
control behavior and communication in animals (and
machines).
cyclic AMP (cAMP; 3’,5’-AMP)
Cyclic adenosine
monophosphate. A compound synthesized from ATP
(by the enzyme adenylyl cyclase) in living cells that acts
as an intercellular and extracellular second messenger
mediating peptide and amine hormones.
cyclic electron flow
Two photosystems are present
in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts: photosys-
tem I and photosystem II. The two photosystems work
together during the light reactions of photosynthesis.
The light-induced flow of electrons beginning with and
returning to photosystem I to produce ATP without
production of NADPH (nicotine adenine dinucleotide
phosphate with hydrogen ) is cyclic electron flow. The
generation of ATP by this process is called noncyclic
photophosphorylation.
cyclin
A protein found in dividing cells that activates
protein kinases (cyclin-dependent protein kinases), a
type of enzyme that adds or removes a phosphate
group from a target protein and controls the progres-
sion of one phase of the cell cycle to the next. The con-
centration of the cyclin increases and decreases during
the cell cycle.
cyclin-dependent kinase
A
protein kinase, an
enzyme involved in regulating cell growth and division,
that must be attached to cyclin to become activated.
cytochrome
A HEME protein that transfers electrons
and exhibits intense absorption bands (the α and β
bands, the α band having the longer wavelength)
between 510 and 615 nm in the reduced form.
Cytochromes are designated types a, b, c, or d,
depending on the position of the α band, which
depends on the type of heme. The iron undergoes oxi-
dation–reduction between oxidation states Fe(II) and
Fe(III). Most cytochromes are hemochromes, in which
the fifth and sixth COORDINATION sites in the iron are
occupied by strong field LIGANDs, regardless of the
oxidation state of iron. Cytochromes can be distin-
guished by the wavelength of the α band, such as
cytochrome c-550. Certain specific cytochromes with
particular functions are designated with suffixes, such
as cytochrome a1, b2, etc.
cytochrome-c 
oxidase
An 
ENZYME,
ferrocyto-
chrome-c: dioxygen OXIDOREDUCTASE, CYTOCHROME
aa3. The major respiratory protein of animal and plant
MITOCHONDRIA, it catalyzes the oxidation of Fe(II)-
cytochrome c, and the reduction of dioxygen to water.
Contains two HEMEs and three copper atoms, arranged
in three centers. Heme a3 and copper-B form a center
that reacts with dioxygen; the second heme is
cytochrome a; the third site, copper-A, is a dinuclear
center.
See also NUCLEARITY.
cytochrome P-450
General term for a group of
HEME-containing MONOOXYGENASEs. Named from
the prominent absorption band of the Fe(II)-carbonyl
complex. The heme comprises PROTOPORPHYRIN IX,
and the proximal LIGAND to iron is a cysteine sulfur.
Cytochromes P-450 of microsomes in tissues such as
liver are responsible for METABOLISM of many XENO-
BIOTICs, including drugs. Others, such as the mito-
chondrial 
ENZYMEs
from 
adrenal 
glands, 
are
involved in biosynthetic pathways such as those of
steroids. The reaction with dioxygen appears to
involve higher oxidation states of iron, such as
Fe(IV)=O.
See also MITOCHONDRIA.
cytokines
Cytokines 
are 
soluble 
glycoproteins
released by cells of the immune system (secreted pri-
marily from leukocytes) that act nonenzymatically
through specific receptors to regulate immune respons-
es. Cytokines resemble hormones in that they act at
low concentrations bound with high affinity to a spe-
cific receptor.
cytokinesis
The final stage of mitosis, when the
parent cell divides equally by cell-wall formation into
cytokinesis
87

two daughter cells by way of a constriction and
drawing in of an actin/myosin ring around the center
of the cell.
cytoplasm
The part of protoplasm in a cell outside
of and surrounding the nucleus. The contents of a cell
other than the nucleus. Cytoplasm consists of a fluid
containing numerous structures, known as organelles,
that carry out essential cell functions.
See also CELL.
cytoplasmic determinants
Substances distributed in
an embryo, but present in an unfertilized egg, that
appear in different blastomeres at the initial cleavage
stage and influence their development fate.
cytoplasmic streaming
The movement and flow of
cytoplasm, the living part of a cell outside the nuclear
membrane. The primary method of movement of mate-
rials within cells, e.g., chloroplasts moving up to the
surface of the leaf and then down, which appear to
help in photosynthesis.
See also CELL.

The internal support system and
framework of a cell, comprising numerous microfila-
ments and tubules that branch throughout the cell. The
cytoskeleton serves not only as mechanical support but
also in transport functions.
See also SKELETON.
cytosol
The semifluid portion of the cytoplasm, not
including organelles.

Dale, Henry Hallett (1875–1968) British Physiolo-
gist
Sir Henry Hallett Dale was born in London on
June 9, 1875, to Charles James Dale, a businessman,
and Frances Ann Hallett. He attended Tollington Park
College in London, Leys School, Cambridge, and in
1894 he entered Trinity College with a scholarship. He
graduated through the Natural Sciences Tripos in 1898,
specializing in physiology and zoology.
In 1900 he gained a scholarship and entered St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital, London, for the clinical part
of the medical course. He received a B.Ch. at Cam-
bridge in 1903 and became an M.D. in 1909.
He took an appointment as pharmacologist at the
Wellcome Physiological Research Laboratories in 1904
and became director of these laboratories in 1906,
working for some six years. In 1914, he was appointed
director of the department of biochemistry and phar-
macology at the National Institute for Medical
Research in London, and in 1928 he became the direc-
tor of this institute, serving until his retirement in
1942, when he became professor of chemistry and a
director of the Davy-Faraday Laboratory at the Royal
Institution, London.
In 1911, he was the first to identify the compound
histamine in animal tissues, and he studied its physio-
logical effects, concluding that it was responsible for
some allergic and anaphylactic reactions. After success-
fully isolating acetylcholine in 1914, he established that
it was found in animal tissue, and in the 1930s he
showed that it is released at nerve endings in the
parasympathetic nervous system, thus establishing
acetylcholine’s role as a chemical transmitter of nerve
impulses.
In 1936 he shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine with his friend German pharmacologist Otto
LOEWI for their discoveries in the chemical transmission
of nerve impulses.
He was knighted in 1932 and appointed to the
Order of Merit in 1944. In addition to numerous arti-
cles in medical and scientific journals that record his
work, he was the author of Adventures in Physiology
(1953), and An Autumn Gleaning (1954).
Sir Henry was president of the Royal Society
(1940–45) and others, and he received many awards.
He married his first cousin Ellen Harriet Hallett in
1904. He died on July 23, 1968, in Cambridge.
dalton
A unit of measurement of molecular weight
based on the mass of one-twelfth the mass of 12C, i.e.,
1.656 × 10–24. A dalton is also called an atomic mass
unit, or amu, and is used to measure atomic mass. Pro-
tein molecules are express in kilodaltons (kDa). The
dalton was named in honor of John Dalton
(1766–1844), an English chemist and physicist.
Dam, Henrik (1895–1976) Danish Biochemist
Carl
Peter Henrik Dam was born in Copenhagen on Febru-
ary 21, 1895, to druggist Emil Dam and his wife 
Emilie (née Peterson), a teacher. He attended the Poly-
technic Institute, Copenhagen, and graduated with a
89
D

degree in chemistry in 1920. The same year he was
appointed assistant instructor in chemistry at the
School of Agriculture and Veterinary Medicine,
advancing to full instructor in biochemistry at the
Physiological Laboratory of the University of Copen-
hagen in 1923.
In 1925 Dam became assistant professor at the
Institute of Biochemistry, Copenhagen University, and
three years later was promoted to associate professor
until 1941. On submitting a thesis Nogle Under-
søgelser over Sterinernes Biologiske Betydning (Some
investigations on the biological significance of the ster-
ines) to the University of Copenhagen in 1934, he
received a Ph.D. in biochemistry.
He discovered vitamin K and its anticoagulant
effects while studying the sterol metabolism of chicks in
Copenhagen and was awarded the Nobel Prize in phys-
iology or medicine in 1943 for this work.
He conducted research at Woods Hole Marine
Biological Laboratories in Massachusetts during the
summer and autumn of 1941 and was a senior
research associate at the University of Rochester, New
York, between 1942 and 1945, and he was an associ-
ate member at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical
Research in 1945.
Dam was appointed professor of biochemistry at
the Polytechnic Institute, Copenhagen, in 1941, though
the designation of his chair at the Polytechnic Institute
was changed to professor of biochemistry and nutrition
in 1950.
After his return to Denmark in 1946, he concen-
trated his research on vitamin K, vitamin E, fats,
cholesterol, and nutritional studies in relation to gall-
stone formation.
He published over 300 articles in biochemistry and
was a member of numerous scientific organizations.
Dam died on April 17, 1976.
darling effect
The stimulation of reproductive
activity by the activity of other members of the species
in addition to the mating pair. Also called the Fraser
darling effect.
Darwinian fitness
The measure of an individual’s
relative genetic contribution to the gene pool of the
next generation; the longer an individual survives and
the more it reproduces, the higher the fitness and the
higher the chance that a hereditary characteristic will
be reproduced.
Darwinism
The evolutionary theory advanced by
Charles Darwin during the mid-19th century suggest-
ing that present-day species have evolved from simpler
ancestors. A newer version of the theory is incorporat-
ed as “neo-Darwinism” or “modern synthesis.”
day-neutral plant
A plant where the length of day is
not an influence on development; the plant will flower
regardless of day length (photoperiodism). It is now
known that it is not the length of the light period, but
the length of uninterrupted darkness, that is critical to
floral development. Examples are tomato, corn, cucum-
ber, and strawberries.
See also PHOTOPERIODISM.
decapods
Crustaceans that have five pairs of walk-
ing legs and a well-developed carapace, e.g., shrimps,
lobsters, hermit crabs, and crabs.
deciduous
A plant, tree, or shrub that sheds its
leaves at the end of the growing season.
See also CONIFER.
decomposers
A trophic level or group of organisms
such as fungi, bacteria, insects, and others that as a
group digest or break down organic matter (dead ani-
mals, plants, or other organic waste) by ingesting,
secreting enzymes or other chemicals, and turning them
into simpler inorganic molecules or compounds that
are released back into the environment.
decumbent
A plant or part of the plant that is reclin-
ing or lying on the ground but with the tip or apex
ascending or pointing up. Also called prostrate, as in a
prostrate shrub.

dehydration 
reaction (condensation 
reaction)
A
chemical reaction in which two organic molecules
become linked to each via COVALENT BONDs with the
removal of a molecule of water; common in synthesis
reactions of organic chemicals.
dehydrogenase
An OXIDOREDUCTASE that catalyzes
the removal of hydrogen atoms from a SUBSTRATE.
deletion
A type of mutation where an alteration or
loss of a segment of DNA occurs from a chromosome
as the consequence of transposition, i.e., when DNA is
being moved from one position from one genome to
another. Such mutations can lead to disease or genetic
abnormality. A terminal deletion refers to breakage and
loss off the end of a chromosome, while an interstitial
deletion is the loss of material from within the chromo-
some, but between the ends. Examples of deletion are
Angelman syndrome, a combination of birth defects
caused by inheriting both copies of the No. 15 chromo-
some from the father, and Prader-Willi syndrome, a
combination of birth defects caused by inheriting both
copies of the No. 15 chromosome from the mother or
by inheriting a deletion of a region in the proximal
long arm of chromosome No. 15 from the father.
Hypopigmentation, which is unusually lighter hair,
eyes, and skin color in relation to other family mem-
bers, is common in Prader-Willi syndrome, especially in
individuals with a partial deletion of the long arm of
chromosome 15. Cri du Chat syndrome is a rare com-
bination of birth defects caused by a deletion of chro-
mosome 5p.
deme
One or more local populations of a taxon that
can interbreed.
demography
The scientific inquiry into the vital
statistics of populations that includes sizes, age–sex
compositions, ratios, distributions, densities, growth,
natality, mortality, migration, and other characteristics
as well as the causes, characteristics, and consequences
of changes in these factors. Because the study seeks
those relationships that can be expressed precisely and
quantitatively, demographers use quantitative analyti-
cal methods, but they turn to other disciplines such as
anthropology, sociology, and others to explain them.
U.S. Census data are a major source of demography for
human studies.
denaturation
In DNA denaturation, two strands of
DNA are separated as a result of the disruption of the
hydrogen bonds following exposure to extreme condi-
tions such as high temperature, chemical treatment, pH
changes, salt concentration, and others. Denaturation
in proteins by heat, acids, bases, or other means results
in a change in the three-dimensional structure of the
protein so that it cannot perform its function and
becomes biologically inactive.
dendrite
The thin extension of a neuron that forms
synapses by producing or responding to neurotrans-
mitters. A dendrite forms connections with the axons
dendrite
91
A particular kind of mutation, i.e., the loss of a piece of DNA from
a chromosome. Deletion of a gene or part of a gene can lead to a

of other neurons and transmits nerve impulses toward
the cell body. A dendrite is also a branch or treelike
figure produced on or in a rock or mineral or a lichen
form.

dengue (dandy fever)
An epidemic disease found in
tropical and subtropical regions. Caused by the dengue
virus (genus Flavivirus [family Flaviviridae]), which is
carried by a mosquito of the genus Aedes (Aedes
aegypti or Aedes albopictus). First described in 1827 in
Zanzibar; an outbreak occurred in Philadelphia in
1780, then called breakbone fever.
denitrification
The reduction of nitrates to nitrites,
nitrogen monoxide (nitric oxide), dinitrogen oxide
(nitrous oxide), and ultimately dinitrogen catalyzed by
microorganisms, e.g., facultative AEROBIC soil bacteria
under ANAEROBIC conditions.
De-nol
Trade name for the potassium salt or mixed
ammonium potassium salt of a bismuth citrate com-
plex, used in the treatment of ulcers.
de novo design
The design of bioactive compounds
by incremental construction of a ligand model within a
model of the RECEPTOR or ENZYME-active site, the
structure of which is known from X-ray or nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) data.
density
In biology, the number of individuals per
unit area or volume.
density-dependent factor
An external process or
biological factor, such as disease, competition, or pre-
dation, that has a greater effect on a population as
the population density increases. A dense population
living closely together is more likely to have more of
its individuals afflicted and affected by disease than a
population that is less dense, with individuals living
farther apart from one another. The term also refers
to a population regulation factor in ecosystems where
the communities have many species and where many
biological interactions are taking place. The term can
also refer to limiting factors that have an increasing
effect on a population as the population increases 
in size.
density-dependent inhibition
A
process where
most normal animal cells stop dividing when they come
into contact with each other.
density-independent factor
An external process or
set of physical factors (weather, flooding, fire, pollu-
tion, etc.) that reduces a population, regardless of size.
This can occur in areas with few species with few bio-
logical interactions. The term applies to limiting fac-
tors that affect all populations, regardless of their
density.
denticity
The number of donor groups from a given
LIGAND attached to the same CENTRAL ATOM.
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)  A high-molecular-
mass linear polymer, composed of NUCLEOTIDES con-
taining 2-deoxyribose and linked between positions
3’ and 5’ by phosphodiester groups. DNA contains
the genetic information of organisms. The double-
stranded form consists of a DOUBLE HELIX of two
complementary chains that run in opposite directions
and are held together by hydrogen bonds between
pairs of the complementary NUCLEOTIDES. The way
the helices are constructed may differ and is usually
designated as A, B, Z, etc. Occasionally, alternative
structures are found, such as those with Hoogsteen
BASE PAIRING.
See also GENETICS.

dendrochronology

deoxyribose
A five-carbon sugar (C5H10O4) compo-
nent of DNA. Joins with a phosphate group and base
to form a deoxyribose nucleotide, the subunit of nucle-
ic acids.
depolarization
A process where a neuron’s electrical
charge becomes less negative as the membrane poten-
tial moves from resting potential (70 mV) toward 0
mV; a decrease in voltage. The loss of membrane polar-
ity is caused by the inside of the cell membrane becom-
ing less negative in comparison to the outside.
Depolarization is caused by an influx of NA+ ions
through voltage-gated Na+ channels in axons.
Depolarization is a reduction in potential that
usually ends with more positive and less negative
charge. Hyperpolarization is the opposite, an increase
in potential that ends with more negative and less
positive charge. Repolarization is when the state
returns to resting potential. Action potentials are
caused by depolarization in nerve cells. An action
potential is a one-way, self-renewing wave of mem-
brane depolarization that propagates at rapid speed
(up to 120 m/sec) along the length of a nerve axon.
Julius Bernstein first proposed the concept of depo-

deposit-feeder
A land organism (e.g., earthworm) that
eats sediment and processes it through a digestive tract or
an aquatic organism (e.g., marine annelid) that ingests
bottom sediments such as the sand and mud of a water
body. Both digest the microorganisms and other organic
matter, with the rest of the material passing through the
gut. Examples of deposit feeders are most oligochaetes
(earthworms [family Lumbricidae] and small freshwater
forms like Tubifex), which includes about 3,500 species.
Polychaetes (nonselective or selective deposit feeders),
such as Nereis (common clamworm) and other marine
worms such as bloodworms, lugworms, fanworms, and
scaleworms, number about 8,000 species. Forms include
the sedentary Arenicola (lugworm), which is a subsurface
(burrow dwelling) deposit feeder, and Amphrites (terre-
bellid), which is a tube-dwelling selective deposit feeder.
dermal tissue system
The outside protective cover-
ing (skin) of young plants consisting of a waxy type
(cuticle) epidermis, a tightly packed single outer layer
of cells that protects and reduces water loss. Stomata
regulate gases passing in and out of the plant and are
usually located on the underside of leaves, and guard
cells regulate the opening by changing water pressure
within the cell to swell or shrink. Also the outer tissue

desferrioxamine (dfo)
Chelating agent used world-
wide in the treatment of iron overload conditions, such
as HEMOCHROMATOSIS and THALASSEMIA.

desmosome
At certain points along adjacent surfaces
of cells there are intercellular attachments: zonula occlu-
den (tight junction), zonula adherens (belt desmosome),
and macula adherens (spot desmosome). Belt desmo-
somes are a specialized lateral cell-to-cell adhesion, or
anchoring junction, that anchors cells, usually epithelial
cells, to each other or to extracellular matter. Consisting
of dense protein plaques, they form tight attachments to
other cells with intermediate filaments consisting of
cytoskeleton material that serves as support and struc-
ture between adjacent cells, between cells, and as an
extracellular matrix. Found in tissues that have been
stretched or are subjected to friction, e.g., heart muscle.
“Spot” desmosomes are found in all epithelial cells and
other tissues such as smooth muscle and are buttonlike
contact points between cells and “spot welds” between
cells and adjacent plasma membranes.
determinate cleavage (mosaic cleavage)
A type of
cleavage in protostomes, usually spiral, in which the
fates of the cells (blastomeres) are fixed and cannot be
changed very early in development. Determinate cleav-
age was first discovered in nematodes.
determinate growth
A growth characteristic of spe-
cific duration in which an organism stops growing after
it reaches a certain size or achieves a specific goal. As
examples: a crop that stops growing and dries after
producing grain; a human adult that stops growing
after achieving final height; a plant that ripens all of its
seeds at the same time; or an apical meristem that dif-
ferentiates into flowers, terminating the production of
additional leaves and stems.
determination
In many organisms, the fates of the
earliest embryonic cells are not determined and have
the potential to develop into many different cell types.
Determination is the process whereby cells are commit-
ted to a particular development fate as the embryo
grows. Portions of the gene are selected for expression
in different embryonic cells, which gradually restricts
cell fate. Cells can progress from being capable of
forming any cell type (totipotent), such as the zygote;
to being capable of forming most tissues of an organ-
ism (pluripotent); to being fully determined.
As an embryo develops, its cells become deter-
mined and committed to developing into particular
parts of the embryo and later adult structures. Follow-
ing determination, cells eventually differentiate into
their final, and often specialized, forms.
Determination is a slow process in which a cell’s
potency is progressively restricted as it develops, and
the determined state is heritable (a type of cell memory)
via somatic cell division. It is irreversible most of the
time, but there have been examples of a cell reverting
back to an undetermined state.

food web. A detrivore is any organism that obtains
most of its nutrients from detritus.
deuterostomes
One of the two groups of coelo-
mates, animals that have a coelom or body cavity
lined with mesoderm. The deuterostomes, which
includes echinoderms and chordates, are animals
where the first opening in the embryo during 
gastrulation becomes the anus, while the mouth
appears at the other end of the digestive system;
opposite of the protostomes (mollusks, annelids,
arthropods), where the mouth forms first during gas-
trulation and before the future anus. The blastopore,
which is the opening of the archenteron in the gastru-
la, is the site of both mouth or anus development in
both groups.
Devonian period
A geological period that existed
during the middle of the Paleozoic era. The Devonian
period existed between 406 and 360 million years ago
and is separated into the Early Devonian period (406
to 387 million years ago), the Middle Devonian period
(387 to 374 million years ago), and the Late Devonian
period (374 to 360 million years ago). It is also called
the age of fishes.
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
dfo
See DESFERRIOXAMINE.
diabetes mellitus
An ailment characterized by
hyperglycemia resulting from the body’s inability to use
blood glucose for energy. There are two types. In type 1
diabetes, the pancreas ceases to make insulin, and
blood glucose does not enter the cells to be used for
energy. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas fails to make
sufficient insulin, or the body is unable to use insulin
correctly. It is estimated to affect some 17 million peo-
ple in the United States and is the sixth leading cause of
death.
diamagnetic
Substances having a negative MAGNET-
IC SUSCEPTIBILITY are diamagnetic. They are repelled by
a magnetic field.
diaphragm
A dome-shaped sheet of thin skeletal
muscle that separates the lungs and heart from the
abdomen and assists in breathing. With inspiration, 
the diaphragm contracts and flattens downward, while
the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, allowing air
to enter the respiratory tract. After expiration, the
diaphragm relaxes back to its dome shape until the
next inspiration.
A
diaphragm is also a modern contraceptive
devices that prevents sperm from reaching and entering
the egg.
diastereoisomers

diastole
One of two phases of the beating heart.
Diastole is the three-step phase when the heart muscle
(ventricles) relaxes, causing blood to fill the heart
chambers. SYSTOLE is when the ventricles contract.
Diastolic blood pressure is the blood pressure measured
during diastole, when the chambers fill with blood. It is
the force exerted by blood on arterial walls. The lowest
blood pressure measured in the large arteries is about
80 mm Hg under normal conditions for a young adult
male.
The three phases—early, mid, and late diastole—
deal with the conditions of the ventricle, semilunar
valve, and atrioventricula valve, while filling, and the
reactions of the SA (sinoatrial) node (the heart’s “pace-
maker”) and AV (atrioventricular) node, which regulate
contractions.
See also BLOOD PRESSURE.

dichotomous
Either halving or branching by pairs.
dicot (dicotyledon)
A member of a subclass of the
angiosperms (division Anthophyta) characterized by
the presence of two cotyledons in the seed, a reticulated
netlike system of veins in the leaves, flower petals in
fours or fives, vascular system arranged in a ring in the
cortex, root development from the radicle with a
fibrous root, and a three-pore pollen structure.
There are about 250,000 species of angiosperms
around the world. They make up the largest classifica-
tion of plants. It is the development of flowers for
reproduction that sets them apart from other plant
types.
Many of our food and economic staples are from
angiosperms, e.g., peanuts, flax, spinach, rice, corn,
cotton.
The class Angiospermae (division Anthophyta) is
the largest classification of plants. Its distinctive charac-
teristic is the development of flowers, which are used
for reproduction. The oldest angiosperm fossils came
from the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic era.
The other angiosperm class is the monocotyledons
(monocots), which evolved from dicot ancestors early
in the development of flowering plants. There are many
more dicots than monocots, and the two groups differ
radically in many ways. Dicots are woody or herba-
ceous; monocots are only herbaceous. The monocots’s
pollen (single pore), vascular arrangement in stems and
roots (scattered bundles), seed leaf (one), flower parts
(multiples of three), and root structure (adventitious
with taproot) are also different.
See also MONOCOT.
differentiation
A process in embryonic development
where unspecialized cells take on their individual
traits, reach mature form, and progressively become
specialized for specific functions such as tissues and
organs.
diffusion
The random dispersion or spreading out of
molecules from a region of high concentration to one
of low concentration, stopping when the concentration
is equally dispersed.
digestion
The process by which living organisms
break down ingested food in the alimentary tract into
more easily absorbed and assimilated products using
enzymes and other chemicals. Digestion can occur in
aerobic conditions, where waste is decomposed by
microbial action in the presence of oxygen, or under
anaerobic conditions when waste is decomposed under
microbial action in the absence of oxygen. In anaerobic
conditions such as in a large animal facility (e.g., a
dairy farm), the by-product, a low-energy biogas that is
made with the combination of methane and carbon
dioxide, can be used as an energy source.
dihybrid cross
The inheritance of two characteristics
from two parents at the same time (e.g., leaf shape and
stem color). If one trait inherited does not affect the
other, the dihybrid cross is two monohybrid crosses
operating concurrently. Traits that do not influence the
inheritance of each other are said to assort indepen-
dently. Demonstrates that Mendel’s Principle of Inde-
pendent Assortment allows each trait to be considered
separately, since each trait is inherited independently of
the other.
dihydrofolate
An oxidation product of TETRAHY-
DROFOLATE that appears during DNA synthesis and
other reactions. It must be reduced to tetrahydrofolate
to be of further use.
See also FOLATE COENZYMES.
dikaryon
The occurrence of two separate haploid
nuclei in each cell in the mycelium of some forms 
of fungi such as basidiomycetes. If the nuclei are 
both the same genotype, it is said to be homokaryotic;
if nuclei are of different genotypes, it is said to be 
heterokaryotic.
dikaryotic
Mycelium or spores containing two 
sexually compatible nuclei per cell. Common in the
BASIDIOMYCETES.

dinosaurs
Animals that arose from a common reptil-
ian ancestor that had developed a hole in the bone of
its hip socket, was erect, was bipedal or quadrupedal,
lived on land, and only lived during the Mesozoic era
between 245–144 million years ago. Birds are the
direct descendents of dinosaurs.
dinuclear
See NUCLEARITY.
dioecious
A term describing individual organisms
that produce only one type of gamete. Asparagus is a
dioecious plant species, having a male (staminate) and
female (pistillate) flowers on separate plants. The term
applies to species where sexes are always separate, e.g.,
humans. It is the opposite of MONOECIOUS.
dioxygenase
An ENZYME that catalyzes the INSER-
TION of two oxygen atoms into a SUBSTRATE, both oxy-
gens being derived from O2.
diploid cell
A cell with two sets of chromosomes,
with one set inherited from one parent and the other
set inherited from the other parent.
diplopods
A subclass of Myriapoda, the common
millipede. They are cylindrical and bear two pairs of
legs on each segment and were one of the first animals
to venture onto dry land, in the Silurian period (438
million to 408 million years ago).
Diptera
Insects 
in 
the 
order 
Diptera 
include
mosquitoes, flies, gnats, and midges. Dipterons have
two wings. Some dipterons are disease vectors (e.g.,
malaria, yellow fever), while others are important polli-
nators, pest predators, and parasites. Dipterons under-
go complete metamorphosis and usually have more
than one generation per year.
directional selection
When natural selection favors
a phenotype at one extreme of the phenotypic range,
giving it an advantage over other individuals in the
population, then that particular trait becomes more
common in that population as other traits are reduced
or eliminated from the population. Over geologic
time, directional selection can lead to major changes
in morphology and behavior of a population or
species.
The classic example is England’s peppered moth
(Biston betularia) and industrial melanism, the gradual
darkening of the wings of many species of moths and
butterflies living in woodlands darkened by industrial
pollution. The light form of the moth was camouflaged
among light-colored lichens on London’s darker-col-
ored trees before the Industrial Revolution. The dark
form of the moth was not observed until 1848, since it
was eaten by predators that easily spotted it. After the
lichens were killed off by the effects of soot pollution
from the Industrial Revolution, the dark form increased
in number, and by 1948, 90 percent of the peppered
moths were dark colored. The light form of the moth
continues to dominate populations in unpolluted areas
outside London. Antibiotic resistance in bacteria and
pesticide resistance in insects are other examples of
directional selection.
disaccharide
A class of sugar, a carbohydrate, creat-
ed by linking together a pair of monosaccharides,
which are simple sugars. An example of a disaccharide
is sucrose, which is glucose joined to fructose. Other
examples include lactose, which is glucose joined with
galactose, and maltose, which is two glucoses joined
together. While disaccharides can be decomposed into
monosaccharides, monosaccharides cannot be degrad-
ed by hydrolysis. However, disaccharides can be
degraded by hydrolysis into monosaccharides.
dismutase
An ENZYME that catalyzes a DISPROPOR-
TIONATION reaction.
dismutase

dismutation
See DISPROPORTIONATION.
dispersion
The distribution pattern, or spacing apart,
of individuals from each other within geographic popu-
lation boundaries. Dispersion can be an aggregated
clump, where individuals are concentrated in specific
locations of their habitat, the most common example.
This is usually because of unequal distribution of avail-
able resources or due to social or reproduction associa-
tions. Uniform dispersion, where everyone is evenly
spaced, is based on individual interactions such as com-
petition. Random dispersion is when individuals are
spaced randomly in an unpredictable manner.
disposition
See DRUG DISPOSITION.
disproportionation (dismutation)  Any chemical reac-
tion of the type A + A   m’ + A” where A, A’, and A”
are different chemical species. The reverse of dispropor-
tionation is called COMPROPORTIONATION.
disruptive 
selection (diversifying 
selection)
Acts
against individuals in the middle of the range of pheno-
types, instead favoring both ends of extreme or unusual
traits and working against common traits in a popula-
tion. Species may evolve into separate ecotypes, that is,
types of individuals within the same species that have
adapted to the special conditions they occupy. BATESIAN
MIMICRY is often used as an example of disruptive
selection. Diversifying selection results in an overall
increase in genetic diversity.
dissimilatory
Related to the conversion of food or
other nutrients into products plus energy-containing
compounds.
dissociation constant
See STABILITY CONSTANT.
distomer
The enantiomer of a chiral compound that
is the less potent for a particular action. This definition
does not exclude the possibility of other effects or side
effects of the distomer.
See also EUTOMER.
DNA
See DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID.
DNA ligase
A linking enzyme involved in replicat-
ing and repairing DNA molecules. It seals “nicks” in
the backbone of a single strand of a double-stranded
DNA molecule; connects Okazaki fragments—short,
single-stranded DNA fragments on the lagging
strand—during DNA replication, producing a comple-
mentary strand of DNA; and links two DNA
molecules together by catalyzing the formation of a
(phosphodiester) bond between the 5’ and 3’ ends of
the nicked DNA backbone.
DNA methylation
A biochemical event that adds a
methyl group (–CH3) to DNA, usually at the base
cytosine or adenosine, and may be a signal for a gene
or part of a chromosome to turn off gene expression
and become inactive.
DNA polymerase
An enzyme that catalyzes the
synthesis of new complementary DNA molecules
from single-stranded DNA templates and primers.
Different DNA polymerases are responsible for 
replication and repair of DNA, and they extend the
chain by adding nucleotides to the 3’ end of the
growing DNA. DNA polymerase catalyzes the 
formation of covalent bonds between the 3’ end of a
new DNA fragment and the 5’ end of the growing
strand.
DNA probe
A single strand of DNA that is labeled
or tagged with a fluorescent or radioactive substance
and binds specifically to a complementary DNA
sequence. The probe is used to detect its incorporation
through hybridization with another DNA sample.
DNA probes can provide rapid identification of certain
species like mycobacterium.

dodo
A large and plump bird (Raphus cucullatus)
that is now extinct. Dutch sailors began using the Indi-
an Ocean island of Mauritius as a stopover in 1598;
the last dodo was killed in 1681. The bird’s extinction
was due to destruction of its habitat and the importa-
tion of animals such as pigs, rats, and monkeys that ate
its eggs and cut off its food supply. Overhunting also
contributed to the bird’s demise. Recently scientists
have determined, through DNA analysis, that the long-
extinct dodo belongs in the dove and pigeon family.
Doisy, 
Edward 
Adelbert (1893–1986) American
Biochemist
Edward Adelbert Doisy was born in
Hume, Illinois, on November 3, 1893, to Edward Perez
and his wife Ada (née Alley). Doisy was educated at the
University of Illinois, receiving a B.A. degree in 1914
and an M.S. degree in 1916. He received a Ph.D. in
1920 from Harvard University.
From 1915 until 1917 he was assistant in biochem-
istry at Harvard Medical School, and the following two
years he served in war in the sanitary corps of the U.S.
Army. From 1919 until 1923 he was an instructor,
associate, and associate professor at Washington Uni-
versity School of Medicine. In 1923 he became profes-
sor of biochemistry at St. Louis University School of
Medicine, and the following year he was appointed
director of the department of biochemistry retiring in
1965 (emeritus 1965–86).
Doisy and his associates isolated the sex hormones
estrone (1929), estriol (1930), and estradiol (1935). He
also isolated two forms of vitamin K and synthesized it

in 1936–39. For his work on vitamin K, Doisy was
awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for
1943.
Later, Doisy improved the methods used for the
isolation and identification of insulin and contributed
to the knowledge of antibiotics, blood buffer systems,
and bile acid metabolism.
In 1936 he published Sex Hormones and in 1939
published, in collaboration with Edgar Allen and C. H.
Danforth, a book entitled Sex and Internal Secretions.
He died on October 23, 1986, in St. Louis.
Domagk, Gerhard Johannes Paul (1895–1964)
German Biochemist
Gerhard Johannes Paul Domagk
was born on October 30, 1895, in Lagow, a small town
in the Brandenburg Marches. He attended school in
Sommerfeld, where his father was assistant headmaster,
until age 14. His mother, Martha Reimer, came from
farming stock in the Marches, where she lived in Som-
merfeld until 1945, when she was expelled from her
home and died from starvation in a refugee camp.
Domagk became a medical student at Kiel and
served in the army during World War I. After being
wounded in 1914, he worked in the cholera hospitals
in Russia. He noticed that medicine of the time had lit-
tle success, and he was moved by the helplessness of
the medical men of that time in treating cholera,
typhus, diarrhea infections, and other infectious dis-
eases. He recognized that surgery had little value in the
treatment of these diseases, and also noticed that
amputations and other radical treatments were often
followed by severe bacterial infections.
In 1918 he resumed his medical studies at Kiel and
graduated in 1921. In 1923 he moved to Greifswald
and a year later became a university lecturer in patho-
logical anatomy. In 1925 he held the same post at the
University of Münster and in 1958 became a professor.
During the years 1927–29 he was given a leave of
absence from the University of Münster to do research
in the laboratories of the I. G. Farbenindustrie, at Wup-
pertal. In 1932 he tested a red dye, Prontosil rubrum.
While the dye itself had no antibacterial properties,
when he slightly changed its chemical makeup, it
showed a remarkable ability to stop infections caused
by streptococcal bacteria in mice. He had discovered
the sulfa drugs that have since revolutionized medicine
and saved many thousands of lives. He was awarded
the 1939 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his
discovery. He died on April 24, 1964.
domain
An independently folded unit within a pro-
tein, often joined by a flexible segment of the polypep-
tide chain. Domain is also the highest taxonomic rank
in the animal kingdom, which consists of three
domains: Eukarya, Bacteria, and Archaea. The Archaea
are commonly known as extremophiles, occurring in
the deep sea vents and hot sulfur springs, whereas the
Eukarya comprise the higher life forms, including
humans.
dominance hierarchy
A social order, or ranking,
developed by a group of individuals that live together
by which certain individuals gain status and exert
power over others. Every individual in the group is
ranked relative to all other community members of the
same sex. Female rank is usually determined by the rel-
ative rank of their mothers, and male ranking may also
be determined by the mother’s rank, or by competition
with other males. Individuals who are higher in the
dominance hierarchy usually have greater access to
food, sex, and other resources. Those males or females
at the highest level of ranking are called alpha male
and alpha female.
dominant allele
An allele that controls the pheno-
type produced and blocks the phenotype expression of
another allele of the same gene, whether or not that
gene is dominant or recessive. This is in contrast to a
recessive allele, which is expressed only when its coun-
terpart allele on the matching chromosome is recessive.
donor atom symbol
A polydentate LIGAND possess-
es more than one donor site, some or all of which may
be involved in COORDINATION. To indicate the points
of ligation, a system is needed. The general and system-
atic system for doing this is called the kappa conven-
tion: single ligating atom attachments of a polyatomic
ligand to a coordination center are indicated by the
italic element symbol preceded by a Greek kappa, κ. In
earlier practice, the different donors of the ligand were
denoted by adding to the end of the name of the ligand
100

the italicized symbol(s) for the atom or atoms through
which attachment to the metal occurs.
double-blind study
A clinical study of potential
and marketed DRUGs, where neither the investigators
nor the subjects know which subjects will be treated
with the active principle and which ones will receive a
placebo.
double circulation
A transportation system for the
blood that has separate pulmonary and systemic sys-
tems. The heart pumps blood to the lungs and back,
then to the body and back via a network of blood ves-
sels. In humans (but not all animals) the blood travels
through the heart twice on each complete journey
around the body. There is no mixing of the two kinds
of blood (oxygen-rich blood is completely separated
from oxygen-poor blood). A double circulation system
maintains the high blood pressure needed for efficient
transport of materials around the body.
double fertilization
Restricted to angiosperms, the
flowering plants, it is a process where one male sperm
cell pollinates an egg to form a zygote, a diploid
embryo, while another male sperm joins with two
other polar nuclei to form a triploid cell, becoming the
endosperm in the ovule. Corn is an example.
double helix
Two strands of DNA coiled about a
central axis, usually a right-handed HELIX. The two
sugar–phosphate backbones wind around the outside
of the bases (A = adenine, G = guanine, T = thymine, C
= cytosine). The strands are antiparallel, thus the phos-
phodiester bonds run in opposite directions. As a
result, the structure has major and minor grooves at
the surface. Each adenine in one strand of DNA is
hydrogen bonded to a thymine in the second strand;
each guanine is hydrogen bonded to a cytosine.
See also DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID.
double prodrug (pro-prodrug)
A biologically inac-
tive molecule that is transformed in vivo in two steps
(enzymatically and/or chemically) to the active species.
Down’s syndrome
The most common and readily
identifiable chromosomal abnormality associated with
mental retardation. There are 47 instead of the usual
46 chromosomes, and the extra chromosome, chro-
mosome 21, changes the orderly development of the
body and brain, showing several symptoms including
a
characteristic body type, mental retardation,
increased susceptibility to infections, and various
heart and other organ abnormalities. It is caused by
one of the parent’s gametes not dividing properly or
Down’s syndrome
101

merge.
Approximately 4,000 children with a Down’s syn-
drome are born in the United States each year, or about
one in every 800 to 1,000 live births. The incidence is
higher for women over age 35, but the condition can
occur at any age for women.
drug
Any substance presented for treating, curing, or
preventing disease in human beings or in animals. A
drug can also be used for making a medical diagnosis
or for restoring, correcting, or modifying physiological
functions (e.g., the contraceptive pill).
drug disposition
Refers to all processes involved in
the absorption, distribution, METABOLISM, and excre-
tion of DRUGs in a living organism.
drug latentiation
The chemical modification of a
biologically active compound to form a new compound,
which in vivo will liberate the parent compound. Drug
latentiation is synonymous with PRODRUG design.
drug targeting
A strategy aiming at the delivery of a
compound to a particular tissue of the body.
drumlin
An oval or elongated hill of glacial drift that
looks like an overturned canoe from the air.
drupe
A fleshy or pulpy fruit with a single seed
enclosed in a pit.
dual-action drug
A compound that combines two
desired different pharmacological actions at a similarly
efficacious dose.
duodenum
The first part of the small intestine;
short, wide, U-shaped, about 12 inches long, and clos-
est to the stomach. The bile duct (gallbladder) and pan-
creatic duct (pancreas) both open into the duodenum.
After food mixes with stomach acid, it moves into the
duodenum and mixes with digestive juices from the
pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, which starts the pro-
cess of breaking down food into its constituent parts.
duplication
A specific kind of mutation: production
of one or more copies of any piece of DNA, including a
gene or even an entire chromosome. A chromosome
structural aberration from an error in meiosis. Duplica-
tion of a portion of a chromosome resulting from fusion
with a fragment from a homologous chromosome.

pounds) or small (e.g., Island fox in the Channel
Islands). Island animal populations tend to acquire dif-
ferent sizes than their mainland counterparts. Dwarfism
may be due to limited food supply, but the reasons for
both gigantism and dwarfism are not known fully.

dynein
A molecular motor, a complex believed to be
made of 12 distinct protein parts, that performs basic
transportation tasks critical to the cell. Converts chem-
ical energy stored in an ATP molecule into mechanical
energy that moves material though the cell along slen-
der filaments called microtubules. One of the most
important functions occurs during cell division, when
it helps move chromosomes into proper position. It
also plays a part in the movement of eukaryotic flagel-
la and cilia.
Molecular motors play a critical role in a host of cell
functions, such as membrane trafficking and cell move-
ment during interphase, and for cell asymmetry develop-
ment. During cell division, they are responsible for
establishing the mitotic or meiotic spindle, as well as seg-
regating chromosomes and dividing the cell at cytokine-
sis. It is the last part of the mitotic cycle during which
the two daughter cells separate. Motors either move
along actin tracks (members of the myosin superfamily)
or microtubules (the dynein and kinesin superfamilies).
Based on the Greek dunamis, meaning “power.”

ecdysone
A juvenile steroid hormone that affects
arthropods and that belongs to the larger class of ecdy-
steroids, sterol derivatives that as a whole affect a variety
of conditions relating to molting and metamorphosis,
including eliciting molting, regulating growth of motor
neurons, controlling choriogenesis, stimulating growth
and development of imaginal discs, initiating break-
down of larval structures during metamorphosis, and
eliciting the deposition of cuticle by the epidermis. In
insects, ecdysone primarily elicits and stimulates molt-
ing. It acts on specific genes, stimulating the synthesis of
proteins involved in these bodily changes, and is pro-
duced by prothoracic glands in insects and Y-organs (a
gland near the external adductor muscles) in crus-
taceans. Ecdysone—formerly called alpha ecdysone, and
beta ecdysone, or ecdysterone (now called 20-hydroxy-
ecdysone [20-HE])—is believed to be the active form.
Ecdysone is not the active molting hormone. Various
tissues, including the fat body, convert ecdysone to 20-
hydroxyecdysone, the active form of molting hormone.
echinoderm
Diversified marine animals (phylum
Echinodermata) that include the classes Crinoidea (sea
lilies), Asteroidea (starfish), Ophiuroidea (brittle stars
or snake stars), Echinoidea (sea urchins and sand dol-
lars), and Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers).
echolocation
A form of sensory perception used by
animals like bats to orient themselves in flight, detect
objects, seek food, and communicate. Bats, for exam-
ple, send out a series of short, high-pitched sounds,
called echoes, that travel, hit an object, and bounce
back, giving the bat the ability to judge distance, size,
shape, and motion.
eclosion
The emergence of an adult insect from the
pupa case or, less commonly, the hatching of an egg.
EC nomenclature for enzymes
A classification of
ENZYMEs according to the Enzyme Commission of the
International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular
Biology. Enzymes are allocated four numbers, the first
of which defines the type of reaction catalyzed; the next
two define the SUBSTRATES; and the fourth is a catalog
number. Categories of enzymes are EC 1, OXIDOREDUC-
TASEs; EC 2, TRANSFERASEs; EC 3, HYDROLASEs; EC 4,
LYASEs; EC 5, ISOMERASEs; EC 6, LIGASEs (synthetases).
ecological efficiency
Each transfer of energy from
one trophic level to another has an ecological efficien-
cy associated with it. Ecological efficiency refers to
the transfer of energy up trophic levels; it is the ratio
of secondary productivity to primary productivity
consumed.
Ecological efficiency goes down as you move up the
trophic levels. Ecological efficiencies generally range
from 5 to 20 percent, meaning that this percentage of
105
E

primary-producer biomass consumed is converted into
new consumer biomass.
Ecological efficiency depends on assimilation effi-
ciency (that portion of the consumed energy assimilat-
ed) and on net production efficacy (that portion of the
consumed energy converted into biomass). Assimilation
efficiencies are greater for carnivores (50–90 percent)
than for herbivores (20–60 percent).
ecological niche
The totality of biotic and abiotic
resources an organism interacts with while living in its
environment.
ecological succession
A transitional change in the
biological community, where a group of plant and/or
animal species gives way to another set of species over
time, in response to a sequence of events such as fire,
storms, human activities, or other natural or human-
made occurrences. The term also refers to the normal
evolution of a community from pioneer stage to climax
community when equilibrium between species and its
environment occurs.
ecology
The study of all life forms and their interac-
tions with their environment.
ecosystem
Any natural system—including biotic and
abiotic parts—that interacts as a unit to produce a sta-
ble functioning system through cyclical exchange of
materials.
ectoderm
The outer layer of an embryo’s three pri-
mary germ layers (endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm)
that gives rise to the nervous system and epidermis in
vertebrates.
ectoparasite
A parasite that feeds from the exterior
of its host.
ectotherm
A cold-blooded organism that relies on
obtaining its heat from certain behavior techniques and
from the external environment (sun); e.g., snakes, alli-
gators, lizards, fish, or amphibians.
EDRF
See ENDOTHELIUM-DERIVED RELAXING FACTOR.
effector cell
A cell that performs a specific function
in response to a stimulus. A gland or muscle cell that
responds to stimuli from the body. Cells with full
immune functions capable of participating in the
immune response by destroying foreign cells or tissues;
effector lymphocytes can mediate the removal of
pathogens from the body.
efficacy
Describes the relative intensity with which
AGONISTs vary in the response they produce, even when
they occupy the same number of RECEPTORs and with
the same AFFINITY. Efficacy is not synonymous with
INTRINSIC ACTIVITY.
Efficacy is the property that enables DRUGs to pro-
duce responses. It is convenient to differentiate the
properties of drugs into two groups: those that cause
them to associate with the receptors (affinity) and those
that produce stimulus (efficacy). This term is often used
to characterize the level of maximal responses induced
by agonists. In fact, not all agonists of a receptor are
capable of inducing identical levels of maximal
response. Maximal response depends on the efficiency
of receptor coupling, i.e., from the cascade of events
that, from the binding of the drug to the receptor, leads
to the observed biological effect.
EF-hand
A
common structure to bind Ca2+
in
CALMODULIN and other Ca2+-binding proteins consist-
ing of a HELIX (E), a loop, and another helix (F).

The mature female reproductive cell.
Ehrlich, Paul (1854–1915) German/Polish Immunol-
ogist
Paul Ehrlich was born on March 14, 1854, near
Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland), to Ismar
Ehrlich and his wife Rosa Weigert, whose nephew was
the great bacteriologist Karl Weigert.

ecological niche

Ehrlich was educated at the Breslau Gymnasium
and then at the Universities of Breslau, Strassburg,
Freiburg-im-Breisgau, and Leipzig. He received his doc-
torate in medicine in 1878 for his dissertation on the
theory and practice of staining animal tissues based on
the work of aniline dyes discovered by W. H. Perkin in
1853.
In 1878 Ehrlich was appointed assistant professor
at the Berlin Medical Clinic, where he continued his
work with dyes used for staining tissues, classifying
them as being basic, acid, or neutral. His work on
staining granules in blood cells laid the foundation for
future work on hematology (the study of blood and
blood-forming tissues) and in the field of staining of
tissues.
In 1882 Ehrlich published his method of staining
the tubercle bacillus that Robert Koch had discovered,
and it was this technique that later became the precur-
sor for the currently used Gram method of staining
bacteria. Ehrlich himself had a bout of tuberculosis.
Ehrlich also discovered the blood–brain barrier when
he noticed that the dyes injected into an animal brain
would not stain.
In 1899 he became director of the newly created
Royal Institute of Experimental Therapy in Frankfurt
and of the Georg-Speyer Haus, founded by Frau
Franziska Speyer for chemotherapy studies, which was
built next door to Ehrlich’s institute. It is here that he
began work on serum antitoxins and chemotherapy
and came up with the concept of the “magic bullet,” a
compound that could be made to selectively target a
disease-causing organism, killing only that organism.
His research programs were guided by his theory that
the germicidal capability of a molecule depended on its
structure, especially its side chains, which could bind to
the disease-causing organism. After many trials search-
ing hundreds of agents with the help of the nearby Cas-
sella chemical works, which donated samples of new
compounds produced in their laboratory, in 1909 he
found a cure for syphilis. The agent he identified was
arsphenamine, trade name Salvarsan (the 606th sub-
stance tested) and later Neosalvaran (the 914th sub-
stance tested). Ehrlich became one of the founders of
chemotherapy.
Ehrlich received the Tiedemann Prize of the Senck-
enberg Naturforschende Gesellschaft at Frankfurt/Main
in 1887, the Prize of Honor at the XVth International
Congress of Medicine at Lisbon in 1906, the Liebig
Medal of the German Chemical Society in 1911, and in
1914 the Cameron Prize of Edinburgh. In 1908 he
shared, with Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov, the Nobel Prize in
recognition for his work on immunity.
The Prussian government elected him privy medical
counsel in 1897, to a higher rank of the counsel in
1907, and in 1911 he reached the highest rank possi-
ble, real privy counsel with the title of excellency. He
died on August 20, 1915, from a stroke.
Eijkman, Christiaan (1858–1930) Dutch Physician
Christiaan Eijkman was born on August 11, 1858, at
Nijkerk in Gelderland (The Netherlands) to Christiaan
Eijkman, the headmaster of a local school, and Johan-
na Alida Pool. He received his education at his father’s
school in Zaandam. In 1875 he entered the Military
Medical School of the University of Amsterdam and
received training as a medical officer for the Nether-
lands Indies Army. From 1879 to 1881 he wrote his
thesis “On Polarization of the Nerves,” which gained
him his doctor’s degree, with honors, on July 13, 1883.
On a trip to the Indies he caught malaria and returned
to Europe in 1885.
Eijkman was director of the Geneeskundig Labora-
torium (medical laboratory) in Batavia from 1888 to
1896, and during that time he made a number of
important researches in nutritional science. In 1893 he
discovered that the cause of beriberi was a deficiency of
vitamins and not, as thought by the scientific communi-
ty, of bacterial origin. He discovered vitamin B, and
this discovery led to the whole concept of vitamins. For
this discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in phys-
iology or medicine for 1929.
He wrote two textbooks for his students at the
Java Medical School, one on physiology and the other
on organic chemistry.
In 1898 he became a professor of hygiene and
forensic medicine at Utrecht, but he also engaged in
problems of water supply, housing, school hygiene,
and physical education. As a member of the Gezond-
heidsraad (health council) and the Gezondheids Com-
missie (health commission), he participated in the
struggle against alcoholism and tuberculosis. He was
also the founder of the Vereeniging tot Bestrijding van
de Tuberculose (Society for the struggle against tuber-
culosis). Eijkman died in Utrecht on November 5,
1930.
Eijkman, Christiaan

Eijkman’s syndrome, a complex of nervous 
symptoms in animals deprived of vitamin B1, is named
for him.
Einthoven, Willem (1860–1927) Dutch Physiologist
Willem Einthoven was born on May 21, 1860, in
Semarang on the island of Java, Indonesia, to Jacob
Einthoven, an army medical officer in the Indies, and
Louise M. M. C. de Vogel, daughter of the then-
director of finance in the Indies.
Upon the death of his father, Einthoven and his
family moved to Holland and settled in Utrecht, where
he attended school. In 1878 he entered the University
of Utrecht as a medical student. In 1885, after receiving
his medical doctorate, he was appointed successor to
A. Heynsius, professor of physiology at the University
of Leiden, where he stayed until his death.
He conducted a great deal of research on the heart.
To measure the electric currents created by the heart,
he invented a string galvanometer (called the Einthoven
galvanometer) and was able to measure the changes of
electrical potential caused by contractions of the heart
muscle and to record them by creating the electrocar-
diograph (EKG), a word he coined. The EKG provides
a graphic record of the action of the heart. This work
earned him the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine
for 1924. He published many scientific papers in jour-
nals of the time. He died on September 29, 1927.
electrochemical gradient
The relative concentration
of charged ions across a membrane. Ions move across
the membrane due to the concentration difference on
the two sides of the membrane as well as the difference
in electrical charge across the membrane.
electrode potential
Electrode potential of an elec-
trode is defined as the electromotive force (emf) of a
cell in which the electrode on the left is a standard
hydrogen electrode and the electrode on the right is the
electrode in question.
See also REDOX POTENTIAL.
electrogenic pump
Any large, integral membrane
protein (pump) that mediates the movement of a sub-
stance (ions or molecules) across the plasma membrane
against its energy gradient (active transport). The
pump, which can be ATP-dependent or Na+-dependent,
moves net electrical charges across the membrane.
electromagnetic spectrum
The entire spectrum of
radiation arranged according to frequency and wave-
length that includes visible light, radio waves,
microwaves, infrared, ultraviolet light, X rays, and
gamma rays. Wavelengths range from less than a
nanometer, i.e., X and gamma rays (1 nanometer is
about the length of 10 atoms in a row), to more than
a kilometer, i.e., radio waves. Wavelength is directly
related to the amount of energy the waves carry. The
shorter the radiation’s wavelength, the higher its
energy. Frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum
range from high (gamma rays) to low (AM radio). All
electromagnetic radiation travels through space at the
speed of light, or 186,000 miles (300,000 km) per
second.
electron
A negatively charged subatomic particle of
an atom or ion.
electron acceptor
A substance that receives elec-
trons in an oxidation-reduction reaction.
electronegativity
Each kind of atom has a certain
attraction for the electrons involved in a chemical
bond. This attraction can be listed numerically on a
scale of electronegativity. Since the element fluorine
has the greatest attraction for electrons in bond-
forming, it has the highest value on the scale. Metals
usually have a low electronegativity, while nonmetals
usually have high electronegativity. When atoms react
with one another, the atom with the higher elec-
tronegativity value will always pull the electrons
away from the atom that has the lower electronega-
tivity value.

electron microscope (EM)
A
very large tubular
microscope that focuses a highly energetic electron
beam instead of light through a specimen, resulting in a
resolving power thousands of times greater than that of
a regular light microscope. A transmission EM (TEM) is
used to study the internal structure of thin sections of
cells, while a scanning EM (SEM) is used to study the
ultrastructure of surfaces. The transmission electron
microscope, the first type of electron microscope, was
developed in 1931 by Max Knoll and Ernst Ruska in
Germany and was patterned exactly on the light trans-
mission microscope except that it used a focused beam
of electrons instead of light to see through the specimen.
The first scanning electron microscope was built in
1942, but it was not available commercially until 1965.
electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR)
A
magnetic resonance spectroscopic technique for the
determination of HYPERFINE interactions between elec-
trons and nuclear spins. There are two principal tech-
niques. In continuous-wave ENDOR, the intensity of
an ELECTRON PARAMAGNETIC RESONANCE signal, par-
tially saturated with microwave power, is measured as
radio frequency is applied. In pulsed ENDOR the radio
frequency is applied as pulses and the EPR signal is
detected as a spin-echo. In each case an enhancement of
the EPR signal is observed when the radio frequency is
in resonance with the coupled nuclei.
electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spec-
troscopy
The form of spectroscopy concerned with
microwave-induced transitions between magnetic ener-
gy levels of electrons having a net spin and orbital angu-
lar momentum. The spectrum is normally obtained by
magnetic-field scanning. Also known as electron spin-
resonance (ESR) spectroscopy or electron magnetic res-
onance (EMR) spectroscopy. The frequency (ν) of the
oscillating magnetic field to induce transitions between
the magnetic energy levels of electrons is measured in
gigahertz (GHz) or megahertz (MHz). The following
band designations are used: L (1.1 GHz), S (3.0 GHz) ,
X (9.5 GHz), K (22.0 GHz), and Q (35.0 GHz). The
static magnetic field at which the EPR spectrometer
operates is measured by the magnetic flux density (B),
and its recommended unit is the tesla (T). In the absence
of nuclear hyperfine interactions, B and ν are related
by: h ν = gµBB, where h is the Planck constant, µB is the
Bohr magneton, and the dimensionless scalar g is called
the g-factor. When the paramagnetic species exhibits an
ANISOTROPY, the spatial dependency of the g-factor is
represented by a 3 × 3 matrix. The interaction energy
between the electron spin and a magnetic nucleus is
characterized by the hyperfine coupling constant A.
When the paramagnetic species has anisotropy, the
hyperfine coupling is expressed by a 3 × 3 matrix called
a hyperfine-coupling matrix. Hyperfine interaction usu-
ally results in splitting of lines in an EPR spectrum. The
nuclear species giving rise to the hyperfine interaction
should be explicitly stated, e.g., “the hyperfine splitting
due to 65Cu.” When additional hyperfine splittings due
to other nuclear species are resolved (“superhyperfine”),
the nomenclature should include the designation of the
nucleus and the isotope number.
electron spin-echo (ESE) spectroscopy
A pulsed
technique in ELECTRON PARAMAGNETIC RESONANCE, in
some ways analogous to pulsed techniques in NMR
(NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY). ESE
can be used for measurements of electron spin relax-
ation times, as they are influenced by neighboring para-
magnets or molecular motion. It can also be used to
measure anisotropic nuclear hyperfine couplings. The
effect is known as electron spin-echo envelope modula-
tion (ESEEM). The intensity of the electron spin-echo
resulting from the application of two or more
microwave pulses is measured as a function of the tem-
poral spacing between the pulses. The echo intensity is
modulated as a result of interactions with the nuclear
spins. The frequency-domain spectrum corresponds to
hyperfine transition frequencies.

electron-transport chain
A chain of electron accep-
tors embedded in the inner membrane of the mitochon-
drion. These acceptors separate hydrogen protons from
their electrons. When electrons enter the transport
chain, the electrons lose their energy, and some of it is
used to pump protons across the inner membrane of
the mitochondria, creating an electrochemical gradient
across the inner membrane that provides the energy
needed for ATP (adenosine triphosphate) synthesis. The
function of this chain is to permit the controlled release
of free energy to drive the synthesis of ATP.

The Karner Blue—
New York’s Endangered Butterfly
by Robert Dirig
The Karner blue (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) is a small,
beautifully colored blue butterfly that died out in southern
Canada in the early 1990s and was listed as an endangered
species by the U.S. government in 1992.
The wings of male Karner blues are deep purplish-blue
with a narrow black rim above, but females have wider dark
gray borders around blue central areas on all four wings,
and a row of bright orange spots on the upper hindwing
edges. In both sexes, the wings have elegant white fringes,
and are pale gray beneath with arcs of black, white-rimmed
dots and orange and satiny blue spots along the hindwing
margin. The wings expand about an inch, so the butterfly is
quite small.
The Karner blue was first discovered in Canada near
London, Ontario, by lepidopterist William Saunders in 1861,
and in the United States at Center (now Karner), New York,
by Joseph Albert Lintner in 1869. It was originally con-
fused with Scudder’s blue (Lycaeides idas scudderi), a
very similar and closely related but more northern butter-
fly. Vladimir Nabokov, the world-famous author best
known for his controversial novel Lolita, also studied but-
terflies and described the Karner blue as new to science
in 1943.
The Karner blue is restricted to a special kind of dry,
sandy habitat where wild blue lupine (Lupinus perennis), its
one caterpillar food plant, grows. Such areas of extensive
sand, commonly called “sand plains,” are of postglacial ori-
gin and occur along major rivers or around large lakes in
northeastern and north-central North America.
The type locality, or the place from which the Karner
blue was first scientifically described, is the Karner Pine
Bush, a large inland pine barrens between Albany and Sch-
enectady, New York. This habitat is unusual in being formed
on undulating sand dunes that are stabilized by a low plant
cover and widely scattered pitch pines (Pinus rigida).
Resplendent clumps of wild blue lupine bloom in open areas
between shrubby oaks (Quercus ilicifolia and Q. prinoides),
blueberries (Vaccinium angustifolium and V. pallidum),
prairie grasses (Schizachyrium scoparium), and other low
herbaceous plants that carpet the dunes. Such landscapes
are a type of savannah, maintained by a natural fire cycle
that keeps them open. Their parklike vegetation is often
very beautiful and quite different from the dense forests that
surround the sand plains.
The Karner blue occurs very locally throughout its
range, with small clusters of populations living many miles
apart. The butterfly was historically known from sites in
Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New York, New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin,
Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, and Ontario. Many locality
records are very old, and the butterfly has since been extir-
pated in areas such as Brooklyn, in New York City, and the
suburbs of Chicago. More recently, Karner blues have died
out in New England and from New York City to Illinois along
the southern edge of their range, except for northern Indi-
ana. The butterfly is presently known to persist naturally
only in Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the
upper Hudson River Valley in New York, with reintroductions
attempted in Ohio and planned for several other areas
where it formerly lived.
The Karner blue’s annual life cycle proceeds like
clockwork: the first hatch of Karner blue adults flies in late
May and early June, when the lupines bloom. After mating,
females lay tiny greenish-white, turban-shaped eggs on
lupine plants at the same season. Within a week, minuscule
caterpillars hatch from the eggs and begin to feed on lupine
leaflets, leaving translucent holes as their unique feeding
sign. They are often attended by ants, which feed on a
sweet fluid the caterpillars produce in glands on their
abdomens, incidentally reducing predation and parasitism.
When fully grown three weeks later, the caterpillars are half
an inch long, with black heads, velvety green bodies, a dark
stripe along their backs, and light stripes along their sides.
They crawl off the plant to find a sheltered place in the litter
for their chrysalis, which is smooth, bright green, and held
to the substrate by a white silken thread around the middle
and by microscopic hooks embedded in a silk pad at the tail
end. Over the next week the developing butterfly’s wings
slowly change from green to white to orange and finally to
purplish-blue inside the transparent chrysalis skin. The sec-
ond brood of adults hatches from mid-July to early August,
and after mating, females again lay eggs on or near the
lupine plants, which by now have largely withered. These
summer eggs do not hatch until the following April, when
new lupine leaves are pushing through the sand. The tiny
spring caterpillars grow, pupate, and produce a new brood
of butterflies in late May, finishing the cycle of two full
broods per year. These dates are for New York State. The
timing of this annual calendar may shift a week or two later
at the northern and western edges of the butterfly’s range,
but the sequence remains the same.
Because this butterfly naturally occurred along or near
waterways where major human settlements have grown,
the Karner blue has been frequently subjected to urbaniza-

tion stresses ever since Europeans colonized North Ameri-
ca. Human disturbance and degradation of its habitat are
primarily responsible for this butterfly’s endangered status
throughout its range. A more subtle effect has been disrup-
tion of the natural fire cycles that keep its habitats open and
sunny. Without fire, the barrens grow up into forests, shad-
ing out open areas the butterflies need for mating, feeding,
and egg laying, and reducing the lupine plants that are nec-
essary for its caterpillars to survive. Global warming may
also be taking its toll: relatively mild winters in the North-
east since the early 1970s have reduced or eliminated the
annual snowpack that shelters the overwintering eggs from
December to March, forcing them to hatch too early, dessi-
cate on sunbaked spring sand, or lie exposed to predators
and parasitoids during this defenseless life stage.
Intensive scientific studies of the Karner blue have
been conducted since 1973, when people first realized that
it was declining in New York. Private conservation efforts
began soon after, starting with the Pine Bush Historic
Preservation Project (headed by Don Rittner), the Karner
Blue Project (conducted by Robert Dirig and John F. Cryan),
and the Xerces Society (led by Robert Michael Pyle and Jo
Brewer). Spider Barbour of the rock group Chrysalis com-
posed the song “Shepherd’s Purse” in the 1970s to highlight
the butterfly’s plight. After the Karner blue was classified as
threatened or endangered in various states, governmental
funding became available, and many ecological studies
were conducted by professional scientists. Today the Karn-
er blue is extremely well known biologically (for example,
we know the elemental composition of its eggshell), and the
butterfly has also been the subject of several studies of
preservation strategies. Habitat conservation efforts have
continued at Karner (Albany Pine Bush), where approxi-
mately 2,750 acres of the type locality have been preserved
to date. Managing this large preserve is challenging, as its
location between urban centers discourages the fires that
are needed to maintain the open vegetation Karner blues
require. Additional preserves have been set aside for the
butterfly and its habitat in many places throughout its range.
The Xerces Society was founded in 1971 to focus on
insect conservation, and initially emphasized imperiled
North American butterflies. This group’s scope has broad-
ened over the past three decades to include all terrestrial
and marine invertebrates, and has had an important, if sub-
tle, impact on North American conservation efforts. It is
named for the Xerces blue (Glaucopsyche xerces), a Califor-
nia butterfly similar to the Karner blue that became extinct in
the 1940s. This vanished insect lived on coastal sand dunes,
where its caterpillars fed on a small legume in San Francis-
co, before its habitat was ruined. Other butterflies that the
Xerces Society has championed include the Atala hairstreak
(Eumaeus atala) and Schaus’ swallowtail (Papilio aristode-
mus ponceanus) in southern Florida; and Smith’s blue
(Euphilotes enoptes smithi), El Segundo blue (Euphilotes
battoides allyni), mission blue (Icaricia icarioides missionen-
sis), and the San Bruno elfin (Callophrys mossii bayensis) in
California. This organization has also expended much effort
in trying to help protect the migratory monarch’s (Danaus
plexippus) spectacular overwintering sites in Mexico.
Among these, the Karner blue is an enduring example
of ongoing human commitment to preserve an endangered
insect in an increasingly crowded world.

The Karner Blue—
New York’s Endangered Butterfly 
(continued)

Concord, New Hampshire. In 1915 he went to Yale
University, left to become an air force pilot in 1918,
and returned to get his B.A. in 1920. He received a
Ph.D. at Harvard in 1930 for a thesis that presented
evidence that bacterial anaphylaxis and hypersensitivity
of the tuberculin type are distinct phenomena, and he
stayed at Harvard until 1946 as a teacher.
In 1938 Enders began the study of some of the
mammalian viruses and undertook, in 1941, in collabo-
ration with others, a study of the virus of mumps. This
work provided serological tests for the diagnosis of this
disease and a skin test for susceptibility to it. It also
demonstrated the immunizing effect of inactivated
mumps virus and the possibility of attenuating the viru-
lence of this virus by passing it through chick embryos.
It showed that mumps often occurs in a form that is not
apparent but that nevertheless confers a resistance that
is as effective as that conferred by the visible disease.
In 1946 Enders established a laboratory for
research in infectious diseases at the Children’s Medical
Center at Boston. The understanding of viruses at the
time was scant, and development of an antipolio vac-
cine depended on gaining the ability to grow sufficient
quantities of the polio virus under laboratory control.
The stumbling block was that poliovirus cultures could
be kept alive for a useful length of time only in nerve
tissue, and that was hard to obtain and maintain.
Enders, along with T. H. WELLER and F. C. ROB-
BINS, found that viruses could be grown on tissues
treated with penicillin to retard bacterial growth, and
they were also successful in growing mumps and polio
viruses as well. The ability to grow and study polio led
to the development of a vaccine later by Salk and
Sabin. The research opened the way to other vaccines
against highly contagious childhood diseases such as
measles, German measles (rubella), and mumps.
Enders, Robbins, and Weller shared the 1954 Nobel
Prize in medicine for this pioneering work.
Enders was a member of many organizations. Con-
sidered one of the most important contributors of the
20th century, Enders also provided insight to links
between viruses and cancer, and the pattern and pro-
cess of tumor growth. He died on September 8, 1985.
endocrine gland
A ductless organ that produces and
secretes hormones into the bloodstream.
See also GLANDS.
endocrine system
A collection of glands that work
interdependently and produce hormones that regulate
the body’s growth, metabolism, and sexual develop-
ment and function. The endocrine system consists of:
two adrenal glands, located on the top of each kidney;
the pancreas, found in the abdominal cavity behind the
stomach; the parathyroid and thyroid, located at the
base of the neck; the pituitary, located at the base of
the brain; and the ovaries and testes, the female and
male sex glands.
Each of the endocrine glands produces hormones
that are targeted to a particular area of the body and are
released into the bloodstream and serve to regulate the
activity of various organs, tissues, and body functions.
endocytosis
A process by which liquids or solid par-
ticles are taken up by a cell through invagination of the
plasma membrane. The plasma membrane creates a
“well” in which the substances settle, become sur-
rounded, and are then pinched off into a vesicle that
can be transported through the cell.
See also PHAGOCYTOSIS; PINOCYTOSIS.
endoderm
One of three primary germ layers in
embryonic development (along with mesoderm and
ectoderm). The endoderm is the inner layer of cells and
gives rise to organs and tissues associated with diges-
tion and respiration.
endodermis
A parenchyma tissue that regulates the
transport of materials into the vascular bundles of most
roots, stems, and leaves. It surrounds the vascular
cylinder; is especially prominent in roots; and has
suberized Casparian strips, a band of suberin (waxy
substance) within the anticlinal walls. It is the inner-
most layer of the cortex in plant roots.
endogenous
Originating internally. In the description
of metal ion COORDINATION in metalloproteins, endoge-
nous refers to internal, or protein-derived, LIGANDs.
endomembrane system
The collection or network
of membranous organelles, such as the endoplasmic
endomembrane system
113

reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, that are inside a
eukaryotic cell; divides the cytoplasm into compart-
ments with various functions, with the compartments
related via direct physical contact or by the use of
membranous vesicles.
endometrium
The lining (mucous membrane) of the
uterus and cervix. The endometrium becomes thicker
as the menstrual cycle advances in preparation for a
fertilized egg. If fertilization does not occur, the
endometrium is shed with the menstrual flow. It con-
sists of the stratum functionale, a thick part of
endometrium that is lost during menstruation, and the
stratum basal, a layer retained during menstruation
that serves as a stem source for regeneration of the
upper stratum functionale.
A cancerous growth in the endometrium is called
endometrial cancer, and an overgrowth in the
endometrium, called endometrial hyperplasia, can
cause abnormal menstrual bleeding and become pre-
cancerous.
endoparasite
Any parasitic organism that lives and
feeds from inside its host.
See also ECTOPARASITE.
endoplasmic reticulum (ER)
An extensive convo-
luted membranous network in the cytoplasm of
eukaryotic cells containing two types. The first is a
rough endoplasmic reticulum, so called because it
appears to be rough due to its surface being covered
with ribosomes, that functions to help cells process
proteins in sacs called cisternae. The second type of
ER is smooth ER and helps cells to process fats. ER
generally contains enzymes to break down both pro-
teins and fats.

endorphin (endogenous morphine or opiod)
A
class of endogenous (made in the body) hormones
produced in the brain and anterior pituitary that are
chemically similar to opiate drugs (such as morphine)
and are released to cope with acute stress and to deal
with pain.
endoskeleton
An internal skeleton.
See also SKELETON.
endosperm
A nutrient, food-storage tissue, formed
from double fertilization (sperm cell fuses to two polar
nuclei) in the seeds of angiosperms, which nourishes
the developing embryo.
endospore
A thick-coated, environmentally resis-
tant protective seedlike cell produced within a bacte-
rial cell that is exposed to harsh conditions. In
mycology, it is the term for spores formed on the
inside of a sporangium; a spore produced within a
spherule.
endosymbiotic theory
A theory on the evolution of
eukaryotic cells. Originally mitochondria and chloro-
plasts were free-living self-replicating cells that devel-
oped a symbiotic relationship with prokaryote cells and
eventually lost their independence.
endothelium
The simple thin layer of endothelial
cells that lines blood and lymph vessels. It plays a num-
ber of roles, including acting as a selective barrier for
molecules and cells between the blood and surrounding
tissues, and secreting and modifying several veinous
signaling molecules. The endothelium also helps to
make up the blood-brain barrier between the central
nervous system and the rest of the body; summons and
captures white blood cells (leukocytes) to the site of
infections; regulates coagulation of the blood at trauma
sites; controls contraction and relaxation of veins; and
regulates the growth of the veinous muscular cells,
among others.
It is also the term used for the innermost layer of
the eye’s cornea, one cell layer thick (5–10 microns or
0.005–0.01 millimeters), that provides hydration bal-
ance to maintain the cornea’s transparency.
114
endometrium

endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF)
The
factor originally described as EDRF is NO., produced
by a specific P-450-type of ENZYME from arginine upon
response of a cell to a biological signal (molecule). Dif-
ferent types of cells respond differently to the presence
of NO..
See also CYTOCHROME P-450.
endotherm
A warm-blooded animal, one is which
the internal temperature does not fluctuate with tem-
perature of environment, but is maintained by a con-
stant internal temperature regulated by metabolic
processes. Examples include birds and mammals.
endothermic
The state of being warm-blooded or
producing heat internally. In chemistry, it is a reaction
where heat enters into a system, with the energy
absorbed by a reactant.
endotoxin
A
large toxic molecule consisting of
polysaccharide, lipid A, and other components found
in the outer cell wall of specific gram-negative bacteria.
Also called pyrogen or lipopolysaccharide.
energy
Classically defined as the capacity for doing
work, energy can occur in many forms such as heat
(thermal), light, movement (mechanical), electrical,
chemical, sound, or radiation. The first law of thermo-
dynamics is often called the Law of Conservation of
Energy and states that energy cannot be created or
destroyed but only transformed from one form into
another.
enhancer
A regulatory element of a gene. A site on
DNA that increases transcription of a region even if it
is distant from the transcribed region. One gene can
have many enhancers.
entatic state
A state of an atom or group that, due
to its binding in a protein, has its geometric or elec-
tronic condition adapted for function. Derived from
the Greek entasis, meaning tension.
enterobactin
A SIDEROPHORE found in enteric bacte-
ria such as Escherichia coli; sometimes called ente-
rochelin.
enterochelin
See ENTEROBACTIN.
entomology
The scientific study of the world of
insects; a branch of zoology.
entomophilous
Refers to a flower pollinated by
insects.
entropy
The amount of energy in a closed system
that is not available for doing work; disorder and ran-
domness in a system. The higher the entropy, the less
energy available for work. The Second Law of Thermo-
dynamics states that the entropy of the universe will
always increase.
environment
The total living and nonliving condi-
tions of an organism’s internal and external surround-
ings that affect an organism’s complete life span.
environmental grain
Describes an organism’s own
perception of its environment and how it will react to
it; a scale based on the use of space in relation to the
size of an organism. Grains can be coarse (large patch-
es) or fine (small patches).
enzootic
Affecting animals living in a specific area or
limited region. Slime-blotch disease caused by Brook-
lynella hostilis and its associates caused a Caribbean-
wide mass fish mortality in 1980 and similar ones in
south Florida and Bermuda. In 1990, enzootic pneu-
monia, caused by Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae was
evident in 80 percent of Iowa farms, and on these
farms, 32 percent of the pigs were actively infected.
enzyme
A macromolecule that functions as a BIO-
CATALYST by increasing the reaction rate, frequently
enzyme
115

containing or requiring one or more metal ions. In gen-
eral, an enzyme catalyzes only one reaction type (reac-
tion specificity) and operates on only a narrow range of
SUBSTRATES (substrate specificity). Substrate molecules
are attacked at the same site (regiospecificity), and only
one, or preferentially one of the ENANTIOMERs of chiral
substrate or of RACEMIC mixtures, is attacked (enan-
tiospecificity).
See also CHIRALITY; COENZYME.
enzyme induction  The process whereby an (inducible)
ENZYME is synthesized in response to a specific inducer
molecule. The inducer molecule (often a substrate that
needs the catalytic activity of the inducible enzyme for
its METABOLISM) combines with a repressor and thereby
prevents the blocking of an operator by the repressor
leading to the translation of the gene for the enzyme. An
inducible enzyme is one whose synthesis does not occur
unless a specific chemical (inducer) is present, which is
often the substrate of that enzyme.
enzyme repression
The mode by which the synthe-
sis of an ENZYME is prevented by repressor molecules.
In many cases, the end product of a synthesis chain
(e.g., an amino acid) acts as a feedback corepressor by
combining with an intracellular aporepressor protein,
so that this complex is able to block the function of an
operator. As a result, the whole operation is prevented
from being transcribed into mRNA, and the expression
of all enzymes necessary for the synthesis of the end-
product enzyme is abolished.
Eocene
Part of the Tertiary period during the Ceno-
zoic era, lasting from about 54.8 to 33.7 million years
ago. Most of the orders of truly warm-blooded mam-
mals were present by the early Eocene.
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
eosinophil
One of the five different types of white
blood cell (WBC) belonging to the subgroup of WBCs
called polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Characterized by
large red (i.e., eosinophilic) cytoplasmic granules.
Eosinophil function is incompletely understood.
They are prominent at sites of allergic reactions and
with parasitic larvae infections (helminths). Eosinophil
secretory products inactivate many of the chemical
mediators of inflammation and destroy cancer cells.
This phenomenon is most obvious with mast-cell-
derived mediators. Mast cells produce a chemotactic
factor for eosinophils.
Eosinophils are produced in the bone marrow, then
migrate to tissues throughout the body. When a foreign
substance enters the body, lymphocytes and neutrophils
release certain substances to attract eosinophils, which
release toxic substances to kill the invader.
See also EOSINOPHILIA.
eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis
(ECF-A)
A substrate released from mast cells and
basophils during anaphylaxis, which attracts eosinophils.
A tetrapeptide mediator of immediate hypersensitivity.
eosinophilia (blood eosinophilia)
An abnormally
high number of eosinophils in the blood. Not a disease
in itself but usually a response to a disease. An elevated
number of eosinophils usually indicates a response to
abnormal cells, parasites, or allergens.
See also EOSINOPHIL.
ephemeral
Transitory, lasting for a brief time.
epidermis
Both plants and animals have epidermis,
the “skin.” Epidermis serves as a protective layer
against invasion of foreign substances both chemical
and animal (parasites).
In plants, it protects against desiccation; partici-
pates in gas exchange and secretion of metabolic com-
pounds; absorbs water; and is the site of receptors for
light and mechanical stimuli.
In mammals, the epidermis is a superficial layer of
the skin and is subdivided into five layers or strata—
the stratum corneum, the stratum basale, the stratum
spinosum, the stratum granulosum, and the stratum
lucidum—each with their own functions.
epigenesis
The complete and progressive develop-
ment and differentiation that starts from the beginning
116
enzyme induction

of a fertilized egg or spore through each stage of
change, guided by genetics and environment until the
final adult stage is completed. A process where a geno-
type becomes expressed and transformed into a final
phenotype.
epiglottis
A leaflike cartilaginous flap that closes and
covers the glottis (middle part of the larynx) to prevent
food and other objects from entering the trachea and
lungs while ingesting.
epilepsy
A
neurological or brain condition in
which a person has a tendency to have repeated
seizures. Clusters of nerve cells, or neurons, in the
brain sometimes signal abnormally. It affects more
than 2 million Americans, with over 180,000 new
cases each year.
epinephrine
Another name for adrenaline. A hor-
mone and neurotransmitter secreted by the adrenal
gland (adrenal medulla) to react to stress, exercise, low
blood glucose. It is also a major component of the
fight-or-flight reaction, the reaction that happens in the
body when, faced with a sudden unexpected threat or
stress situation, both epinephrine and norepinephrine
are released.
The drug of choice for the treatment of anaphylax-
is. Individuals who are allergic to insect stings and cer-
tain foods should always carry a self-injecting syringe
of epinephrine.
Epinephrine increases the speed and force of heart-
beats and, therefore, the work that can be done by the
heart. It dilates the airways to improve breathing and
narrows blood vessels in the skin and intestine so that
an increased flow of blood reaches the muscles and
allows them to cope with the demands of exercise. Usu-
ally treatment with this hormone stops an anaphylactic
reaction. Epinephrine has been produced synthetically
as a drug since 1900.
epiparasite
Any organism that extracts nutrients
from its host plant by means of intermediates.
epiphyte
Any nonparasitic plant, fungus, or microor-
ganism that grows on the surface of another plant for
support but provides its own nourishment. Epiphytes
can form “mats” that contain a surface of canopy
plants with suspended soil and other material. A facul-
tative epiphyte is one that commonly grows epiphytical-
ly and terrestrially, but will usually exhibit a preference
for one or the other habit in a particular habitat.
episome
A plasmid (circular piece of DNA ) that can
attach to and integrate its DNA in a cell and at other
times exist freely and still replicate itself alone, e.g., cer-
tain bacterial viruses.
epitasis
Interaction between nonallelic genes, with
one gene altering the expression of the other gene.
epithelial tissues
Closely packed layers of epithelial
cells, a membranelike tissue that covers the body and
epithelial tissues

lines body cavities, such as the gastrointestinal tract
and the lining of the lung. Epidermal growth factor
(EGF) is a hormone that causes epithelial tissues, such
as skin and the cells lining the gastrointestinal tract and
lungs, to grow and heal.
epitope (antigenic determinant)
These are particular
chemical groups on a molecule that are antigenic, i.e.,
that elicit a specific immune response.
epizootic
A rapid spread of a disease throughout an
area affecting an animal group, e.g., rabies (disease
affecting raccoons, fox) or epizootic catarrhal enteritis
(disease affecting mink). When it occurs in humans, it
is called an epidemic.
epoch

Erlanger, Joseph (1874–1965) American Neurosci-
entist
Joseph Erlanger was born on January 5, 1874,
in San Francisco, California, to Herman and Sarah
Erlanger. He received a B.S. in chemistry at the Uni-
versity of California and later attended Johns Hopkins
University to study medicine, receiving an M.D.
degree in 1899. He was appointed assistant in the
department of physiology at the medical school, after
spending a year of hospital training at Johns Hopkins
Hospital, until 1906, moving up successively as
instructor, associate, and associate professor. He was
then appointed the first professor of physiology in the
newly established Medical School of the University of
Wisconsin. In 1910 he was appointed professor of
physiology in the reorganized Medical School of the
Washington University, St. Louis, retiring in 1946 as
chairman of the school.
In 1922, in collaboration with his student Herbert
Gasser, Erlanger adapted the cathode-ray oscillograph
for the study of nerve-action potentials. They ampli-
fied the electrical responses of single nerve fibers and
analyzed them by the use of the oscilloscope. The
characteristic wave pattern of an impulse generated in
a stimulated nerve fiber could be observed on the
screen and the components of the nerve’s response
studied.
Erlanger and Gasser were given the Nobel Prize in
medicine or physiology in 1944 for this work. Erlanger
later worked on the metabolism of dogs with shortened
intestines, on traumatic shock, and on the mechanism
of the production of sound in arteries.
With Gasser he wrote Electrical Signs of Nervous
Activity (1937). He died on December 5, 1965, in St.
Louis.
erythrocyte
A concave red blood cell that functions
totally within the cardiovascular system. It does not
have a nucleus or cytoplasmic organelles and produces
little enzyme activity. It contains the red pigment
hemoglobin, an oxygen-binding protein, and the cell
functions as an efficient vessel for the exchange of res-
piratory gas. Originates from bone marrow in adult
humans.
See also BLOOD.
Escherichia coli
A gram-negative, rodlike bacterium
that forms acid and gas in the presence of carbohy-
drates and is commonly found in human intestines and

mancy with slow metabolism (no eating, moving, or
growing) during periods of hot temperature and little
water supply; a physiological condition for survival.
estrogens
Primary female sex hormones. Estrogens
cause growth and development of female sex organs
and support the maintenance of sexual characteristics,
including growth of underarm and pubic hair and
shaping of body contours and skeleton; increase secre-
tions from the cervix and growth of the endometrium
(inner lining) of the uterus; and reduce concentrations
of bad cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) while increasing
good cholesterol (HDL). Estrogen is produced in the
ovary by the developing follicle and by the corpus
luteum.
See also HORMONE.
estrous cycle (heat cycle)  The period from one ovula-
tion to the next in female mammals; a period of sexual
receptiveness preceding ovulation; in humans it occurs
every 21 to 23 days. It is characterized by rising and
falling levels of estrogens and progesterone in the
bloodstream.
estrus
The “heat” cycle in reproduction, the time
when the female is sexually receptive.
ethology
The study of natural animal behavior.
ethylene (C2H4)
A reactive chemical made from nat-
ural gas or crude-oil components (occurs naturally in
both petroleum and natural gas) that acts as a plant
hormone, the only gaseous hormone. It is used for
accelerating fruit ripening (bananas); maturing citrus
fruit color; increasing the growth rate of seedlings, veg-
etables, and fruit trees; leaf abscission; and aging.
etiology (aetiology)
The scientific study or theory of
the causes of a certain disease.
euchromatin
Within a nucleus of eukaryotes there
are two types of a mixture of nucleic acid and protein
called chromatin that make up a chromosome: euchro-
matin and heterochromatin. During interphase, the
genetically active euchromatin is uncoiled and is avail-
able for transcription, while heterochromatin is denser
and usually not transcribed.
eudismic ratio
The POTENCY of the EUTOMER rela-
tive to that of the DISTOMER.

IC material packed in a membrane-surrounded, struc-
turally discrete nucleus and who have well-developed
cell organelles.
eumetazoa
A subkingdom of the animalia king-
dom that includes all animals with the exception of
eumetazoa
119

sponges; animals with cells that form tissues and
organs, a mouth, and digestive tract. Two branches
exist, the radiata and the bilateria. The radiata have
radial symmetry, i.e., all longitudinal planes are equal
around a central body axis, while the bilateria 
are animals that have bilateral symmetry, i.e., they
have a definite front and rear, and left and right body
surfaces.
Eurasia
Europe plus Asia considered as one conti-
nent. Used in political, economic, and geographical
terms.
eusocial
A social system of insects, belonging to the
order Isoptera (termites) and the order Hymenoptera
(ants, bees, and wasps), in which the individuals coop-
erate in caring for the young after one female produces
offspring. There is a reproductive division of labor, and
previous generations aid in rearing. This trait also
occurs in two species of mammals (mole rats).
eutherian mammals (placental mammals)
The female
has a placenta that is connected to an embryo within
the uterus that supplies it with nutrients and oxygen
and acts as an excretory system. Humans are eutherian
mammals.
eutomer
The enantiomer of a chiral compound that
is the more potent for a particular action.
See also DISTOMER.
eutrophication
The accelerated loading or dumping
of nutrients in a lake by natural or human-induced
causes. Natural eutrophication changes the character of
a lake very gradually, sometimes taking centuries, but
humanmade or cultural eutrophication speeds up the
aging of a lake, changing its qualities quickly, often in a
matter of years.
eutrophic lake
Any lake that has an excessive supply
of nutrients, usually nitrates and phosphates. Eutrophic
lakes are usually not deep, contain abundant algae or
rooted plants, and contain limited oxygen in the bot-
tom layer of water.
See also MESOTROPHIC LAKE; OLIGOTROPHIC LAKE.
evaporative cooling
Temperature reduction when
water absorbs latent heat from the surrounding air as it
evaporates. Similarly, “cooling” of the skin from the
evaporation of sweat is evaporative cooling and is a
process for the body to lose excess heat.
evolution
The long process of change that occurs in
populations of organisms. It began with the first life
forms on Earth and created the diversity of life forms
that exist today and that will exist in the future.
evolutionary species concept
A species comprises
the totality of individuals that share a common evolu-
tionary history. A species is a lineage evolving separate-
ly from others.

large substances to the outside using secretory vesicles,
storage organelles, that are then fused with the plasma
membrane where they open for export.
exogenous
Originating externally. In the context
of metalloprotein 
LIGANDs, exogenous describes 
ligands added from an external source, such as CO 
or O2.
exon
A section of DNA that carries the coding
SEQUENCE for a protein or part of it. Exons are separat-
ed by intervening, noncoding sequences (called
INTRONs). In EUKARYOTES, most GENEs consist of a
number of exons.
exoskeleton
The hard external skeleton made from
chitin and connective tissue that attaches it to the
underlying parts of a body of animals such as arthro-
pods (insects, spiders, crabs, lobsters). Serves as protec-
tion, antidessicant, and sensory interface with the
environment.
See also SKELETON.
exothermic
A
reaction that produces heat and
absorbs heat from the surroundings.
exotoxin
A toxic substance produced by bacteria
and then released outside its cell into its environment.
exponential population growth
Rapid population
growth; populations increase at a constant proportion
from one generation to the next. For example, the
human population is doubling every 40 years. The rate
of increase is not limited by environmental factors,
only biotic or intrinsic factors. If birth rates exceed
death rates, population size will increase exponentially;
likewise if death rates exceed birth, population size will
decrease exponentially. Also known as J-shaped popu-
lation growth.
expression
The cellular production of the protein
encoded by a particular GENE. The process includes
TRANSCRIPTION of DNA, processing of the resulting
mRNA product, and its TRANSLATION into an active
protein. A recombinant gene inserted into a host cell by
means of a vector is said to be expressed if the synthe-
sis of the encoded polypeptide can be demonstrated.
For the expression of metalloproteins, usually other
gene products will be required.
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS)
EXAFS effects arise because of electron scattering by
atoms surrounding a particular atom of interest as that
special atom absorbs X rays and emits electrons. The
atom of interest absorbs photons at a characteristic
wavelength, and the emitted electrons, undergoing con-
structive or destructive interference as they are scat-
tered by the surrounding atoms, modulate the
absorption spectrum. The modulation frequency corre-
sponds directly to the distance of the surrounding
atoms, while the amplitude is related to the type and
number of atoms. EXAFS studies are a probe of the
local structure. EXAFS can be applied to systems that
have local structure, but not necessarily long-range
structure, such as noncrystalline materials. In particu-
lar, bond lengths and local symmetry (COORDINATION
numbers) can be derived. The X-ray absorption spec-
trum can also show detailed structure below the
absorption edge. This X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) arises from excitation of core elec-
trons to high-level vacant orbitals.

extracellular matrix (ECM)
Material produced by
animal cells and secreted into the surrounding area,
serving as a glue to hold cells together in tissues. It is
composed of proteoglycans, polysaccharides, and pro-
teins. Plays a role in cell shape, growth, migration, and
differentiation.
extraembryonic 
membranes
The 
YOLK
SAC,
AMNION, CHORION, AND ALLANTOIS, four membranes
that support and nourish the developing embryo in rep-
tiles, birds, and mammals. The allantois performs gas
exchange and is a repository for the embryo’s nitroge-
nous waste. It is involved in the development of the uri-
nary bladder. The chorion is the outermost layer and
contributes to the formation of the placenta. The
amnion, the innermost layer, forms a fluid-filled sac
around the embryo to protect it from jarring. The yolk
sac surrounds the yolk and is the site of blood-cell for-
mation and germ-cell formation, which are the prede-
cessors of male and female gametes.
extrinsic asthma
Asthma triggered by external
agents such as pollen or chemicals. Most cases of
extrinsic asthma have an allergic origin and are caused
by an IgE-mediated response to an inhaled allergen.
This is the type of asthma commonly diagnosed in
early life. Many patients with extrinsic asthma respond
to immunotherapy.

born in Danzig, Germany (now Gdansk, Poland), in
1686, the oldest of five children. Fahrenheit’s major
contributions lay in the creation of the first accurate
thermometers in 1709 and a temperature scale in 1724
that bears his name today.
When he was 15 years of age, his parents died of
mushroom poisoning. The city council placed the four
younger Fahrenheit orphans in foster homes and
apprenticed Daniel to a merchant who taught him
bookkeeping. He was sent to Amsterdam around 1714,
where he learned of the Florentine thermometer, invent-
ed in Italy 60 years prior in 1654 by the grand duke of
Tuscany, Ferdinand II (1610–70), a member of the
powerful Medici family. For some unknown reason, it
sparked his curiosity and he decided to make ther-
mometers for a living. He abandoned his bookkeeping
apprenticeship, whereby Dutch authorities issued war-
rants for his arrest. While on the run, he spent several
years traveling around Europe and meeting scientists,
such as Danish astronomer Olaus Roemer. Eventually
he returned to Amsterdam in 1717 and remained in the
Netherlands for the rest of his life.
What seems so simple today—having a fixed scale
and fixed points on a thermometer—was not obvious
in Fahrenheit’s time, when several makers used differ-
ent types of scales and liquids for measuring. In 1694
Carlo Renaldini, a member of the Academia del Cimen-
to and professor of philosophy at the University of
Pisa, was the first to suggest taking the boiling and
freezing points of water as the fixed points. The acade-
my was founded by Prince Leopoldo de Medici and the
Grand Duke Ferdinand II in 1657 with the purpose of
examining the natural philosophy of Aristotle. The
academy was active sporadically over 10 years and
concluded its work in 1667 with the publication of the
Saggi di Naturali Esperienze.
Unfortunately, Florentine thermometers, or any
thermometers of the time, were not very accurate; no
two thermometers gave the same temperature, since
there was no universal acceptance of liquid type or
agreement on what to use for a scale. Makers of Flo-
rentine thermometers marked the low end of the scale
as the coldest day in Florence that year and the high
end of the scale as the hottest day. Because tempera-
ture fluctuations naturally occur over the years, no
two thermometers gave the same temperature. For sev-
eral years Fahrenheit experimented with this problem,
finally devising an accurate alcohol thermometer in
1709 and the first mercury or “quicksilver” ther-
mometer in 1714.
Fahrenheit’s first thermometers, from about 1709 to
1715, contained a column of alcohol that directly
expanded and contracted, based on a design made by
Danish astronomer Olaus Romer in 1708, which Fahren-
heit personally reviewed. Romer used alcohol (actually
wine) as the liquid, but his thermometer had two fixed
reference points. He selected 60 degrees for the tempera-
ture of boiling water and 7.5 degrees for melting ice.
Fahrenheit eventually devised a temperature scale
for his alcohol thermometers with three points calibrated
at 32 degrees for freezing water, 96 degrees for body
temperature (based on the thermometer being in a
healthy man’s mouth or under the armpit), and zero
degrees fixed at the freezing point of ice and salt,
believed at the time to be the coldest possible tempera-
ture. The scale was etched in 12 major points (with zero,
four, and 12 as three points) and eight gradations
between the major points, giving him a total of 96 points
for his scale for body temperature on his thermometer.
Because his thermometers showed such consistency
in their measurements, mathematician Christian Wolf
at Halle, Prussia, devoted a whole paper in an edition
of Acta Eruditorum, one of the most important inter-
national journals of the time, on two of Fahrenheit’s
thermometers that were given to him in 1714. From
1682 until it ceased publication in 1731, the Latin Acta
Eruditorum, published monthly in Leipzig and sup-
ported by the duke of Saxony, was one of the most
important international journals. The periodical was
founded by Otto Mencke, professor of morals and
practical philosophy, and mathematician Gottfried Wil-
helm Leibnitz. Written in Latin, the journal covered sci-
ence and social science and was primarily a vehicle for
reviewing books. In 1724 Fahrenheit published a paper,
“Experimenta circa gradum caloris liquorum nonnullo-
rum ebullientium instituta (Experiments done on the
degree of heat of a few boiling liquids), in the Royal
Society’s publication Philosophical Transactions and
was admitted to the Royal Society the same year.
Fahrenheit decided to substitute mercury for the
alcohol because its rate of expansion was more con-
stant than that of alcohol and could be used over a
wider range of temperatures. Fahrenheit, like ISAAC
NEWTON before him, realized that it was more accurate
to base the thermometer on a substance that changed
consistently based on temperature instead of simply on
124
Fahrenheit, Daniel Gabriel

the hottest or coldest day of the year, like the Floren-
tine models. Mercury also had a much wider tempera-
ture range than alcohol. The choice of mercury as a
benchmark was contrary to the common thought at the
time, promoted by Halley as late as 1693, who believed
that mercury could not be used for thermometers
because of its low coefficient of expansion.
Fahrenheit later adjusted his temperature scale to
ignore body temperature as a fixed point, bringing the
scale to just the freezing and boiling of water. After his
death, scientists recalibrated his thermometer so that
the boiling point of water was the highest point, chang-
ing it to 212 degrees, as Fahrenheit had earlier indicat-
ed in a publication on the boiling points of various
liquids. The freezing point became 32 degrees, and
body temperature became 98.6 degrees. This is the
scale that is presently used in thermometers in the Unit-
ed States and some English-speaking countries,
although most scientists use the Celsius scale.
By 1779 there were some 19 different scales being
used for thermometers, but it was Fahrenheit, along
with astronomer ANDERS CELSIUS and Jean Christin—
whose scales were presented in 1742 and 1743—who
helped finally set the standards for an accurate ther-
mometer that are still used today. Besides making ther-
mometers, Fahrenheit also was the first to show that
the boiling point of liquids varies at different atmo-
spheric pressures, and he suggested this as a principle
for the construction of barometers. Among his other
contributions were a pumping device for draining the
Dutch polders and a hygrometer for measuring atmo-
spheric humidity.
Fahrenheit died on September 16, 1736, in The
Hague at the age of 50 years. There is virtually no one
in the English-speaking countries today who does not
have a thermometer with his initial (F) on it.

family
The taxonomic category between order and
tribe, but if no tribe exists, then it is the category
between order and genus. Also a social unit related by
marriage, descent, or kinship.
farsightedness
A condition in eyesight where distant
objects can be seen better than objects that are closer. It
is the inability of images to focus properly on the retina
of the eye. The eye is too short or the cornea is too flat,
so that the images focus beyond the retina and cause
close objects to appear blurry. Also called hyperopia or
presbyopia, when the lens of the eye begins to lose elas-
ticity (normal aging process).
fat (general)
Any substance made up of lipids or fatty
acids that supply calories to the body and can be found
in solid or liquid form (e.g., margarine, vegetable oil);
three fatty acids linked to a glycerol molecule form fat.
fat (triacylglycerol)
Triacylglycerols are storage lipids,
comprising three fatty acids attached to a glycerol
molecule, found mostly stored in adipose (fat) cells and
tissues. They are highly concentrated regions of
metabolic energy. Because there are abundant reduced
CH groups available in fats for oxidation-required
energy production, they are excellent storage contain-
ers of energy. Fats can be found in plants, animals, and
animal plasma lipoproteins for lipid transport. Former-
ly known as triglyceride.
fatty acid
Fatty acids are the components of two
lipid types mostly found in cells in the form of large
lipids or small amounts in free form: storage fats and
structural phospholipids. They consist of long hydro-
carbon chains of varying length (from four to 24 
carbon atoms), containing a terminal carbonyl group 
at one end and may be saturated (has only a single 
carbon-to-carbon bond) or unsaturated (one or more
double or triple carbon-to-carbon bonds). The number
and location of double bonds also vary for the different
fatty acids. More than 70 different kinds have been
found in cells. Saturated fatty acids have higher levels
of blood cholesterol, since they have a regulating effect
on its synthesis, but unsaturated ones do not have that
effect and thus they are more often promoted nutrition-
ally. Some fatty acids are palmitic acid, palmitoleic
acid, alpha-linolenic acid, eleostearic acid, linoleic acid,
oleic acid, and elaidic acid. Three fatty acids linked to a
glycerol molecule form fat.
fauna
All wild birds and all wild animals (both
aquatic and terrestrial); includes wild mammals, reptiles,

amphibians, and aquatic and nonaquatic invertebrate
animals, and all such wild animals’ eggs, larvae, pupae,
or other immature stage and young.
feedback inhibition (end-product inhibition)
A way
for the end product of a cell’s biosynthetic pathway to
stop the activity of the first enzymes in that pathway,
thereby controlling the enzymatic activity; it stops the
synthesis of the product.
female
Sex classification by gender. The individual in
a sexually reproducing species that produces eggs.
Female mammals, for example, nourish their young with
milk. In humans, females have two X chromosomes.
FeMo-cofactor
An inorganic CLUSTER that is found
in the FeMo protein of the molybdenum-NITROGENASE
and is essential for the catalytic reduction of N2 to
ammonia. This cluster contains Fe, Mo, and S in a
7:1:9 ratio. The structure of the COFACTOR within the
FeMo protein can be described in terms of two
cuboidal SUBUNITs, Fe4S3 and MoFe3S3 bridged by
three S2– ions and “anchored” to the protein by a histi-
dine bound via an imidazole group to the Mo atom
and by a cysteine bound via a deprotonated SH group
to an Fe atom of the Fe4S3 subunit. The Mo atom at
the periphery of the molecule is six-coordinate and, in
addition to the three sulfido LIGANDs and the histidine
imidazole, is also bound to two oxygen atoms from an
(R)-homocitrate molecule.

Fenton reaction
Fe2+ + H2O2 Fe3+ + OH. + OH–.
This is the iron-salt-dependent decomposition of dihy-
drogen peroxide, generating the highly reactive hydrox-
yl radical, possibly via an oxoiron(IV) intermediate.
Addition of a reducing agent such as ascorbate leads to
formation of an acyclic compound, which increases the
damage to biological molecules.
See also HABER-WEISS REACTION.
fermentation
The anaerobic decomposition of com-
plex organic substances by microorganisms such as
bacteria, molds, or yeast, called ferments, on a fermen-
tation substrate that produce simpler substances or
some other desired effect, such as the yielding of
ethanol and carbon dioxide from yeast for commercial
purposes, the production of ATP and energy produc-
tion, and the development of antibiotics and enzymes.
Fermentation is used by microflora of the large intes-
tine to break down indigestible carbohydrates.
Large fermentors are used to culture microorgan-
isms for the production of some commercially valuable
products such as bread, beer, wine, and other beverages.

ferromagnetic
If there is coupling between the indi-
vidual magnetic dipole moments of a PARAMAGNETIC
sample, spontaneous ordering of the moments will
occur at low temperatures. If this ordering results in an
electronic ground state in which the moments are
aligned in the same direction (parallel), the substance is
said to be “ferromagnetic.” If the ordering results in an
electronic ground state in which the moments are
aligned in opposite directions, the substance is said to
be “antiferromagnetic.”

feedback inhibition

fertilization
The combining of two gametes from
different sexes to form a zygote, e.g., the penetration
of sperm into the egg and the resulting combining of
genetic material from both that develops into an
embryo. The process involves karyogamy, the fusion
of nuclei of both gametes, and plasmogamy, the
fusion of cytoplasm. Each gamete contains a haploid
set of chromosomes, with the resulting nucleus con-
taining a diploid set of chromosomes. Fertilization
can also be self-induced by the fusion of male and
female gametes from the same euploid (nucleus of a
cell contains exact multiples of the haploid number of
chromosomes) organism; cross fertilized by the fusion
of male and female gametes from different euploid
individuals; or double fertilized, in which two sepa-
rate sperm cells unite with two cells in the embryo
sac to form the zygote and endosperm, such as in
angiosperms.
In agriculture, fertilization means the application
of nutrients, a fertilizer, to soil in order to promote
growth and development of domestic or crop plants.
[2Fe-2S]
Designation of a two-iron, two-labile-sulfur
CLUSTER in a protein, comprising two sulfido-bridged
iron atoms. The oxidation levels of the clusters are
indicated by adding the charges on the iron and sulfide
atoms, i.e., [2Fe-2S]2+; [2Fe-2S]+. The alternative desig-
nation, which conforms to inorganic chemical conven-
tion, is to include the charges on the LIGANDs; this is
more appropriate where the ligands are other than the
usual cysteine sulfurs, such as in the RIESKE IRON–SUL-
FUR PROTEINs.
See also FERREDOXIN.
[4Fe-4S]
Designation of a four-iron, four-labile-sul-
fur CLUSTER in a protein. (See [2FE-2S].) Possible oxida-
tion levels of the clusters are [4Fe-4S]3+; [4Fe-4S]2+;
[4Fe-4S]+.

fetus
An unborn offspring in the postembryonic
stage where the major features of the organism can be
seen.
F factor
A bacterial plasmid, which is a piece of
DNA that is able to replicate independently of the
chromosome, that allows a prokaryote (cell with no
nucleus) to join together with and pass DNA. An epi-
some that can replicate by itself or in integrated form
and move from one bacterium to another while conju-
gating. A circular piece of DNA that can replicate inde-
pendently of the bacterial chromosome or integrate and
replicate as part of the chromosome.

fiber
127
Colored scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of sperm clustered
around a human egg (ovum) during fertilization. The rounded egg
(at center) is seen on human tissue. Sperm attached to its surface
appear as fine hairlike structures; each sperm has a rounded
head and a long tail. They are penetrating the thick spongy sur-
face of the zona pellucida of the egg, a surface layer that attracts
sperm to the egg and enables the sperm to attach. The human
female usually produces a single large egg, and only one of the
millions of male sperm may penetrate the egg’s wall to fuse with
the egg nucleus. Once fertilized, the egg begins its process of
growth by cell division. (Courtesy © K.H. Kjeldsen/Photo

Also part of sclerenchyma tissue, which is thickened
cell walls of lignin, composed of both sclereids, short
cells, and the longer fibers, and lacking a living proto-
plast when mature.
In human nutrition, fiber is a carbohydrate that
resists the action of digestive enzymes and passes
through 
the 
human 
digestive 
system 
virtually
unchanged, without being broken down into nutrients.
There are insoluble fibers, found in wholegrain prod-
ucts and vegetables, that help the digestive system by
moving stools through the digestive tract by keeping
them soft. Soluble fiber slows the digestive process and
is water-soluble. Found in beans, fruits, and oat prod-
ucts, it is thought to help lower blood fats and blood
glucose (sugar).
Fiber is also a slender, elongated natural or syn-
thetic filament capable of being spun into yarn, e.g.,
cotton.
Fibiger, Johannes Andreas Grib (1867–1928) Dan-
ish Pathologist
Johannes Andreas Grib Fibiger was
born in Silkeborg, Denmark, on April 23, 1867, to C.
E. A. Fibiger, a local medical practitioner, and Elfride
Muller, a writer.
Fibiger studied under bacteriologists Robert KOCH
and Emil von Behring, and from 1891 to 1894 he was
assistant to Professor C. J. Salomonsen at the depart-
ment of bacteriology at the University of Copenhagen.
He received his doctorate from the University of
Copenhagen in 1895 based on research into the bacte-
riology of diphtheria.
He was appointed prosector at the university’s
Institute of Pathological Anatomy (1897–1900), princi-
pal of the Laboratory of Clinical Bacteriology of the
Army (1890–1905), and in 1905 became the director
of the central laboratory of the army and consultant
physician to the Army Medical Service.
Fibiger’s early research dealt with diphtheria 
and tuberculosis, and he developed laboratory 
methods for growing the causing bacteria as well as
a
serum to protect against the disease. Fibiger
achieved the first controlled induction of cancer in
laboratory animals, after research in studying tumors
in the stomachs of animals, by feeding mice and 
rats with cockroaches infected with a worm. His
work led others to pursue the research on chemical 
carcinogens and led to the development of modern
cancer research.
Fibiger was a founding member and joint editor of
the Acta Pathologica et Microbiologica Scandinavica,
and coeditor of Ziegler’s Beiträge zur pathologischen
Anatomie und zur allgemeinen Pathologie. He received
the 1927 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his
work on cancer, specifically for his “discovery of the
Spiroptera carcinoma.” Fibiger died on January 30,
1928, in Copenhagen.
fibril
A small or microscopic thread of cellulose that
is part of the cellulose matrix of plant cell walls. The
contractile unit of a muscle cell or a bundle of filaments
in a striated muscle cell; the thin fibrous structure of a
nerve; a long fine hair or fiber; many fibrils bundle
together to form a fiber. Makes up the smallest unit of
paper fibers. Also a linear feature in the H alpha chro-
mosphere of the Sun, found near strong sunspots and
plages or in filament channels. Fibrils parallel strong
magnetic fields.
fibrin
An insoluble stringy protein derived from fib-
rinogen that facilitates blood clotting by forming
threads and creating the mesh around the clot. A blood
clot is also called a fibrin clot. Coagulation begins usu-
ally with an injury to some part of the body. The body
forms a clot from a mixture of the blood protein fibrin
and platelets. After the bleeding stops, a blood protein
dissolves the clot by breaking down the fibrin into tiny
fragments.
fibroblast (fibrocyte)
A flat, elongated, branched,
irregular and motile cell type found in vertebrate con-
nective tissue that produces extracellular collagen and
elastin fibers; spindlelike with long cytoplasmic exten-
sions at each end and with oval, vesicular nuclei; most
abundant cell type found in the skin. Fibroblasts differ-
entiate into chondroblasts that secrete cartilage matrix,
collagenoblasts that proliferate at chronic inflammation
sites, and osteoblasts that secrete bone matrix. They
form the fibrous tissues in the body, tendons, and
aponeuroses, the shiny, broad sheets of connective tis-
sue that bind muscle fibers together to form muscles, as
well as supporting and binding tissues.

fight-or-flight reaction
The reaction in the body
when faced with a sudden and unexpected threat or
stress. The reaction is immediate to either run or stay
and fight. In humans, a sudden release of the hormones
epinephrine and norepinephrine increases blood flow
to the muscles and increases blood pressure. The result-
ing increase in muscle strength and mental ability pre-
pares the body for either reaction that is chosen. In
other animals such as the wood thrush (Hylocichla
mustelina), flight is preferred over fight.
filial generation (offspring generation)
The succes-
sive generations of progeny in a controlled series of
crosses, beginning with two specific parents (the P gen-
eration), and intercrossing the progeny of each new
generation. F1 is the first offspring or filial generation
between any two parents, the first generation of
descent; F2 is the second (grandchildren); and so on.
filter feeding
The filtering of suspended food parti-
cles from a water current by using gill rakers or similar
organs.
fingerprinting
In genetics, the identification of multi-
ple specific alleles on a person’s DNA to produce a
unique identifier for that person; used in forensics. There
are six steps to DNA fingerprinting. First the DNA must
be isolated and removed from the cells of the animal or
plant. Then special enzymes, called restriction enzymes,
are used to cut the DNA at specific places, and the DNA
are sorted by size. The DNA pieces are then transferred
to a nylon sheet, which is then probed. The fingerprint is
generated by adding tagged probes to the nylon sheet,
and each probe sticks in only one or two specific places,
wherever the sequences match. The final DNA finger-
print is created by using several different probes, with
the resulting end product looking like a grocery store bar
code. DNA fingerprinting is increasingly being used in
criminal cases, and people have been freed from prison
based on DNA fingerprinting.

Finsen, Niels Ryberg (1860–1904) Danish Physi-
cian
Niels Ryberg Finsen was born on December 15,
1860, in the capital city Thorshavn in the Faroe Islands
(Denmark) to Johanne Fröman and Hannes Steingrim
Finsen, an Icelandic family that could trace its ancestry
back to the 10th century and occupied many of the
highest positions in the administration of the Faroe
Islands. He received his early education in schools at
Thorshavn and then at Herlufsholm in Denmark.
In 1882 Finsen went to Copenhagen to study
medicine. After taking his final examination in 1890, he
became prosector of anatomy at the University of Copen-
hagen until 1893. He continued with private tutoring of
medical students to make a moderate income.
By 1883 he was diagnosed with Pick’s disease,
characterized by progressive thickening of the connec-
tive tissue of certain membranes in the liver, the heart,
and the spleen, with long-term impairment of the func-
tions of these organs. He also developed symptoms of
heart trouble and ascites, and became more and more
of an invalid until finally during his last years he was
confined to a wheelchair. It did not prevent him from
making contributions to medicine.
He was instrumental in discovering the effects of
light—and in particular ultraviolet light (then called
red light)—as phototherapy against diseases such as
lupus vulgaris in 1893. In 1895 he made a great break-
through that established his international reputation by
introducing the revolutionary carbon-arc treatment
(Finsen’s therapy) of lupus. In 1896 he founded the Fin-
sen Medical Light Institute (now the Finsen Institute) in
Copenhagen.
He received the Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine on December 10, 1903, for his work in treat-
ing diseases with light.
Among the many publications by Finsen, two are
especially noteworthy: Om Lysets Indvirkninger paa
Huden (On the effects of light on the skin) appeared in
1893, and the classical treatise Om Anvendelse i
Medicinen af koncentrerede kemiske Lysstraaler (The
use of concentrated chemical light rays in medicine)
was published in 1896. The results of much of his
research are contained in the communications pub-
lished by his institute. Finsen tried to combat his illness
in various ways, including keeping a diet poor in salt
during his last years. This led to his last publication, a
thorough study of En Ophobning af Salt i Organismen
(An accumulation of salt in the organism) in 1904.
In 1899 he became Knight of the Order of Dan-
nebrog, and a few years later the Silver Cross was
Finsen, Niels Ryberg

added. He was a member or honorary member of
numerous societies in Scandinavia, Iceland, Russia, and
Germany. He received a Danish gold medal for merit,
and in 1904 the Cameron Prize was given to him from
the University of Edinburgh.
In 1892 Finsen married Ingeborg Balslev, the
daughter of Bishop Balslev at Ribe. They had four chil-
dren. Finsen died on September 24, 1904.
firefly
Commonly called a lightning bug, they are
neither flies nor bugs. They belong to the order
Coleoptera, family Lampyridae, which are beetles.
These small flying beetles produce their own light, from
a chemical called luciferase, from structures in their
abdomen. Females of some species, which are wingless,
and many larvae also produce light and are called
glowworms. Fireflies can be seen in early summer (late
May), appearing at dusk. Males and females attract
each other with a flashing green light in their
abdomens. The wingless females flash from the ground
and the males look for them. There are more than
2,000 species of firefly in temperate and tropical envi-
ronments worldwide.
first law of thermodynamics
Simply put, energy
can neither be created nor destroyed, only trans-
formed or transferred from one molecule to another;
in effect, the total amount of energy in the universe is
constant. Also known as the Law of Conservation of
Energy. Thermodynamics is the study of the conver-
sion of energy between heat and other forms, e.g.,
mechanical.
See also SECOND LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS.
fission (binary fission)
Asexual reproduction or divi-
sion of a single-celled individual, such as a prokaryote,
into two new single-celled individuals of equal size and
genetic composition, without mitosis occurring. From
the Latin fissilis, meaning “easily split.”
fixation
The complete prevalence of one gene form
(allele), resulting in the total exclusion of the other.
Genes that confer a reproductive advantage generally
go to fixation.
fixed action pattern (FAP)
A series of innate behav-
ior patterns (a fixed action) in response to a specific
stimulus (called a sign stimulus or innate releaser) that
continues until the response is completed. FAPs are
genetic and not individually learned. For example, a
group of spined larvae of the buck moth (Hemileuca
maia) will all instantly raise their bodies and thrash
back and forth when a predator (bird) approaches.
flaccid
Limp, soft condition, e.g., walled cells are
flaccid in isotonic surroundings; low turgid pressure;
opposite of turgid.
flagellum
A long whiplike structure that is used to
propel certain kinds of prokaryote and eukaryote cells.
The cells can have an individual flagellum or a few
flagella per cell. In prokaryote organisms the flagellum
is composed of a protein called flagellin. In the eukary-
ote organism, it is longer than a CILIUM but has the
same construction of nine outer double microtubules
and two inner single microtubules.
flanking region
The DNA sequences extending on
either side of a specific gene or locus; a region preced-
ing or following the transcribed region. The 3’ flanking
region (downstream flanking region) is found immedi-
ately distal (distant) to the part of a gene that specifies
the mRNA and where a variety of regulatory sequences
are located. The 3’ flanking region often contains
sequences that affect the formation of the 3’ end of the
message and may contain enhancers or other sites to
which proteins may bind. The 5’ flanking region flanks
the position that corresponds to the 5’ end of the
mRNA and is that part of DNA that precedes the tran-
scription-start site for a particular gene. The 5’ flanking
region contains the promoter (transcription control
region) and other enhancers or protein binding sites.
flatworms
Organisms that comprise the phylum
Platyhelminthes. These are normally hermaphroditic
organisms that have flat bodies and are bilaterally sym-
metrical, with defined head and tail, centralized ner-
vous system, and eyespots (light-sensitive cells). They
include flukes (trematodes), tapeworms (Cestoda), and
130
firefly

free-living flatworms (Turbellaria), and it is estimated
that more than 20,000 species exist. Millions of
humans are host to these parasites.
flavin
A PROSTHETIC GROUP found in flavoproteins
and involved in biological oxidation and reduction.
Forms the basis of natural yellow pigments like
riboflavin.
flea
A major group of bloodsucking insects that feed
on animals, belonging to the order Siphonaptera. There
are about 2,000 known species existing on all conti-
nents. Some species are vectors for diseases. They are
wingless, flattened-body types with legs with long
claws. They can jump from 14 to 16 inches.
While they tend to be associated with pets such as
cats and dogs (Ctenocephalides canis [dog flea] and
Ctenocephalides felis
[cat flea]), they do include
humans as hosts.
Fleming, Sir Alexander (1881–1955) British Bacte-
riologist
Sir Alexander Fleming was born on a farm
at Lochfield near Darvel in Ayrshire, Scotland, on
August 6, 1881. He attended Louden Moor School,
Darvel School, and Kilmarnock Academy before mov-
ing to London, where he attended the Polytechnic Insti-
tute. He spent four years in a shipping office before
entering St. Mary’s Medical School, London University,
where he received an M.B., B.S., with gold medal in
1908, and became a lecturer at St. Mary’s until 1914,
when he served during World War I, returning to St.
Mary’s in 1918. He was elected professor of the school
in 1928 and emeritus professor of bacteriology, Univer-
sity of London, in 1948.
Fleming was interested in the natural bacterial
action of the blood and in antiseptics, and he worked
on antibacterial substances that would not be toxic to
animal tissues. In 1921 he discovered an important
bacteriolytic substance that he named lysozyme. In
1928 he made his most important discovery while
working on an influenza virus. He noticed that mold
had developed accidentally on a staphylococcus culture
plate and that the mold had created a bacteria-free cir-
cle around itself. Further experiments found that a
mold culture prevented growth of staphylococci, even
when diluted 800 times. He named the active substance
penicillin.
Sir Alexander wrote numerous papers on bacteriol-
ogy, immunology, and chemotherapy, including original
descriptions of lysozyme and penicillin. He was the
recipient of numerous awards and honors in scientific
societies worldwide. Fleming shared the Nobel Prize in
physiology or medicine in 1945 with Ernst Boris CHAIN
and Howard Walter FLOREY, who both (from 1939)
carried Fleming’s basic discovery forward in the isola-
tion, purification, testing, and quantity production of
penicillin. Fleming died on March 11, 1955, and is
buried in St. Paul’s Cathedral.
flicker fusion rate (critical flicker frequency)
The
rate beyond which the human eye can no longer recog-
nize discontinuous changes in brightness as a flicker,
i.e., the rate is the frequency at which the “flicker” of
an image cannot be distinguished as an individual event.
The flicker fusion rate (FFR) is 31.25 Hz, or 60 frames
per second (bright light) and 24 frames per second (dim
light) in humans. When a frame rate is above this num-
ber, the eye sees the signal as a consistent image (as on
television). A fly has an FFR of 300 frames per second.
flora
The term for all plants in a given location or,
collectively, on the planet.
Florey, Sir Howard Walter (1898–1968) Australian
Pathologist
Sir Howard Walter Florey was born on
September 24, 1898, in Adelaide, South Australia, to
Joseph and Bertha Mary Florey. His early education
was at St. Peter’s Collegiate School, Adelaide, and then
Adelaide University, where he graduated M.B., B.S., in
1921. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to Mag-
dalen College, Oxford, leading to the degrees of B.Sc.
and M.A. in 1924. He then attended Cambridge as a
John Lucas Walker student.
In 1925, he visited the United States on a Rocke-
feller traveling fellowship for a year, returning in 1926
to a fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cam-
bridge, receiving a Ph.D. in 1927. At this time he also
held the Freedom Research Fellowship at the London
Hospital. In 1927, he was appointed Huddersfield 
Lecturer in Special Pathology at Cambridge. In 1931 he
Florey, Sir Howard Walter
131

succeeded to the Joseph Hunter Chair of Pathology at
the University of Sheffield.
In 1935 he became professor of pathology and a
fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford. He was made an
honorary fellow of Gonville and Caius College, Cam-
bridge, in 1946, and an honorary fellow of Magdalen
College, Oxford, in 1952. From 1945 to 1957 he was
involved in the planning of the John Curtin School of
Medical Research in the new Australian National Uni-
versity. In 1962 he was made provost of Queen’s Col-
lege, Oxford.
During World War II he was appointed honorary
consultant in pathology to the army, and in 1944 he
became Nuffield visiting professor to Australia and
New Zealand.
His collaboration with Ernst Boris CHAIN, which
began in 1938, led to the systematic investigation of
the properties of naturally occurring antibacterial sub-
stances. Lysozyme, an antibacterial substance found in
saliva and human tears, discovered by Sir Alexander
FLEMING, was their original interest, but they moved to
substances now known as antibiotics. The work on
penicillin was a result.
In 1939 Florey and Chain headed a team of
British scientists, financed by a grant from the Rocke-
feller Foundation, whose efforts led to the successful
small-scale manufacture of penicillin. They showed
that penicillin could protect against infection but that
the concentration of penicillin in the human body—
and the length of time of treatment—were important
factors for successful treatment. In 1940 a report was
issued describing how penicillin had been found to be
a chemotherapeutic agent capable of killing sensitive
germs in the living body. An effort was made to create
sufficient quantities for use in World War II to treat
war wounds, and it is estimated to have saved thou-
sands of lives. In 1945 Florey was awarded a Nobel
Prize in medicine with Alexander Fleming and Ernst
Chain.
Florey was a contributor to and editor of Antibi-
otics (1949). He was also coauthor of a book of lec-
tures on general pathology and has had many papers
published on physiology and pathology.
In 1944 he was created a knight bachelor. When a
life peerage was conferred on him in 1965, he chose to
be styled Lord Florey of Adelaide and Marston. He
was provost of Queen’s College, Oxford, from 1962
until he died on February 21, 1968.
flower
The reproductive part of a plant. Can be both
male and female, producing both pollen and ovule.
Flowers are the most commonly used part in identify-
ing a plant and are often showy and colorful.
fluid feeder
An animal that lives by sucking nutrient-
rich fluids from another living organism. The two main
ways to fluid-feed are piercing and sucking, and cutting
and licking. Examples of insects that pierce and suck are
platyhelminths, nematodes, annelids, and arthropods,
which all have distinct mouth parts that bore into their
prey and then suck out the prey’s body fluids with a
pharynx. Secreted enzymes help aid in the digestion of
the fluids. Piercing by insects typically involves the use
of a proboscis formed by the maxillae and composed of
two canals. The first canal carries in the prey’s blood,
and the other delivers saliva and anticoagulants.
The cutting-and-licking technique is used by black
flies and vampire bats, who cut the prey’s body with
teeth or sharp mouthparts and then lick the fluids
while injecting anticoagulants to prevent clotting.
fluid mosaic model
The model proposes that a plas-
ma membrane surrounds all cells and is composed of
about half lipids, mostly phospholipids and cholesterol,
and half proteins, with the proteins and phospholipids
floating around the membrane in constant motion
unless they bind to something. By being fluid, the lipid
molecules can move to open up as a channel whereby
substances can enter or leave. The protein molecules in
the membrane act as carrier, channel, or active trans-
port mechanisms for larger molecules that must enter
or leave the cell.
fluke
An organism belonging to the phylum Platy-
helminthes, a flatworm of the class Trematoda. Flukes
are flat, unsegmented, and parasitic. Two orders exist,
the Mongenea (monogenetic flukes) and Digenea (dige-
netic flukes). Humans become hosts for Schistosoma
mansoni (human blood fluke) and Fasciola hepatica
(sheep liver fluke).
Also a single lobe of a whale’s tail.
folate coenzymes
A group of heterocyclic com-
pounds that are based on the 4-(2-amino-3,4-dihydro-
132
flower

4-oxopteridin-6-ylmethylamino) benzoic acid (pteroic
acid) and conjugated with one or more L-glutamate
units. Folate derivatives are important in DNA synthe-
sis and erythrocyte formation. Folate deficiency leads
to ANEMIA.
folivore
An animal whose primary source of food is
foliage. For example, the larvae of the buck moth
(Hemileuca maia [Drury]) eats only the leaves of oak,
favoring scrub, live, blackjack, and post oaks; the
Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis) lar-
vae feed only on the leaves of wild blue lupine (Lupi-
nus perennis).
See also HERBIVORE.
follicle
Any enclosing cluster or jacket of cells, or a
small sac or pore, that protects and nourishes within it
a cell or structure. A fluid-filled follicle in the ovary
harbors the developing egg cell. When the follicle rup-
tures (ovulation), an egg is released. A hair follicle
envelops the root of hair.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
A U.S. fed-
eral agency responsible for regulating the development,
use, and safety of drugs, medical devices, food, cosmet-
ics, and related products.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is a scien-
tific, regulatory, and public health agency that oversees
items accounting for 25 cents of every dollar spent by
consumers. Its jurisdiction encompasses most food
products (other than meat and poultry); human and
animal drugs; therapeutic agents of biological origin;
medical devices; radiation-emitting products for con-
sumer, medical, and occupational use; cosmetics; and
animal feed. The agency grew from a single chemist in
the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1862 to a staff of
approximately 9,100 employees and a budget of
$1.294 billion in 2001, comprising chemists, pharma-
cologists, physicians, microbiologists, veterinarians,
pharmacists, lawyers, and many others. About one-
third of the agency’s employees are stationed outside of
the Washington, D.C., area, staffing over 150 field
offices and laboratories, including five regional offices
and 20 district offices. Agency scientists evaluate appli-
cations for new human drugs and biologics, complex
medical devices, food and color additives, infant for-
mulas, and animal drugs. Also, the FDA monitors the
manufacture, import, transport, storage, and sale of
about $1 trillion worth of products annually at a cost
to taxpayers of about $3 per person. Investigators and
inspectors visit more than 16,000 facilities a year and
arrange with state governments to help increase the
number of facilities checked.
food chain
The energy path in a community by way
of food from those who produce it to those that feed
on them. For example, plants are eaten by herbivores
that are eaten by carnivores. Food chains that are inter-
connected are called food webs.
forensics
The use of social and physical sciences to
combat crime, e.g., the science of using DNA for iden-
tification. It has been used to identify victims; estab-
lish paternity in child-support cases; and prove the
presence of a suspect at a crime scene. Forensic sci-
ence can be used for issues from burglary to environ-
mental protection.
formation constant
See STABILITY CONSTANT.
formula
An exact representation of the structure of a
molecule, ion, or compound showing the proportion of
atoms that compose the material, e.g., H2O.
Forssmann, Werner Theodor Otto (1904–1979)
German Surgeon
Werner Theodor Otto Forssmann
was born in Berlin on August 29, 1904, to Julius Forss-
mann and Emmy Hindenberg. He was educated at the
Askanische Gymnasium (secondary grammar school) in
Berlin. In 1922 he went to the University of Berlin to
study medicine, passing his state examination in 1929.
For his clinical training he attended the University
Medical Clinic and in 1929 went to the August Victo-
ria Home at Eberswalde near Berlin.
He developed the first technique for the catheteri-
zation of the heart by inserting a cannula into his own
antecubital vein, through which he passed a catheter
for 65 cm. He then walked into the X-ray department
Forssmann, Werner Theodor Otto
133

to have a photograph taken of the catheter lying in his
right auricle. He abandoned cardiology after being
ridiculed for this act. André F. Cournand and Dickin-
son W. Richards perfected this procedure. He was
appointed chief of the surgical clinic of the city hospital
at Dresden-Friedrichstadt and at the Robert Koch Hos-
pital, Berlin. During World War II he became a prisoner
of war until his release in 1945, when he went into
practice with his wife. Beginning in 1950 he practiced
as a urological specialist at Bad Kreuznach. In 1958 he
was chief of the surgical division of the Evangelical
Hospital at Düsseldorf until 1970.
In 1956 he was awarded, together with André COUR-
NAND and Dickinson W. RICHARDS, the Nobel Prize in
physiology or medicine for their work in development of
cardiac catheterization. He was also appointed honorary
professor of surgery and urology at the Johannes Guten-
berg University, Mainz. He was awarded many honors
and belonged to a number of scientific organizations dur-
ing his career. He died on June 1, 1979, in Schopfheim, in
the Black Forest in West Germany.
fossil
Preserved remains or imprints of once-living
plants or animals or their tracks, or burrows, or prod-
ucts (e.g., dung).
founder effect
When a small population migrates
from a larger population, becomes isolated, and forms
a new population, the genetic constitution of the new
population is that of a few of the pioneers, not the
main population source; the genetic drift observed in a
population founded by a small nonrepresentative sam-
ple of a larger population; it is the difference between
the gene pool of a population as a whole and that of a
newly isolated population of the same species.
See also GENETIC DRIFT.
fragile X syndrome
It is the most common form of
genetically inherited mental retardation. Named for its
association with a malformed X chromosome tip, the
frequency of the syndrome is greater in males than in
females, occurring in approximately 1 in 1,000 male
births and 1 in 2,500 female births. In 1991 the
causative gene FMR-1 (fragile X mental retardation)
was discovered. Fragile X is the most common inherit-
ed cause of learning disability and affects boys and girls
of all ethnic groups.
fragmentation
A mechanism of asexual reproduc-
tion in which the parent plant or animal separates into
parts that re-form whole organisms.
frameshift mutation
A mutation via an addition of
a pair or pairs of nucleotides that changes the codon
reading frame of mRNA by inserting or deleting
nucleotides.
fraternal
In offspring, twins that are not identical.
Identical twins occur when both fetuses come from
the division of a single fertilized egg and have separate
placentas. Fraternal twins can be either same or oppo-
site sex.
free energy
Energy readily available for producing
change in a system.
free radical
A molecule that contains at least one
unpaired electron; highly reactive chemical that usually
exists only for a short time. Formed in the body during
oxidation, a normal by-product of metabolism, they
can bind with electrons from other molecules and can
cause cellular damage by disrupting normal cellular
processes, but can be kept in check by antioxidants
such as certain enzymes or vitamins (C and E).
freshwater
The Earth is mostly water, which covers
74 percent of its surface. Freshwater accounts for only
3 percent of the total water. Freshwater is water that
contains less than 1,000 milligrams per liter (mg/L) of
dissolved solids. The United States Geological Survey
(USGS) states that, generally, more than 500 mg/L of
dissolved solids is undesirable for drinking and many
industrial uses.
Fritts, Harold Clark (1928–
) American Botanist,
Dendrochronologist
Harold Fritts was born on
134
fossil

December 17, 1928, in Rochester, New York, to
Edwin C. Fritts, a physicist at Eastman Kodak Compa-
ny, and Ava Washburn Fritts. As a young boy he was
interested in natural history and weather and even 
had a subscription to daily weather maps. Along with
his maps, he constructed a weather vane that read out
wind directions in his room. Fritts attended Oberlin
College in Oberlin, Ohio, from 1948 to 1951 and
received a B.A. in botany. From 1951 to 1956 he
attended Ohio State University in Columbus and
received an M.S. in botany in 1953 and a Ph.D. in
1956.
Fritts made major contributions in understanding
how trees respond to daily climatic factors and how
they record that information in ring structure. He
developed a method to statistically record a tree’s
response to changes in climate. Using that information
he developed a method to reconstruct climate from past
tree rings and to reconstruct spatial arrays of past cli-
mate from spatial arrays of tree-ring data. He also
developed a biophysical model of tree-ring structure
response to daily weather conditions. This work has
laid the groundwork for much current dendroclimatic
reconstruction work.
Fritts authored nearly 60 pioneering scientific
papers on dendrochronology, including the bible of the
field, Tree Rings and Climate in 1976, one of the most
cited books on the subject. In 1965 he was elected a
fellow in the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science. He received a John Simon Guggen-
heim fellowship in botany in 1968. In 1982 he was
given the Award for Outstanding Achievement in Bio-
climatology from the American Meteorological Society,
and in 1990 he received the Award of Appreciation
from the dendrochronological community, in Lund,
Sweden.
Fritts pioneered the understanding of the biological
relationships and reconstruction of past climate from
tree-ring chronologies. He currently is engaged in some
scientific writing and is finishing work on the tree ring
model.

frond
The leaf of a fern or palm. Consists of the
stipe (petiole or stalk of the fruiting body) and blade,
the expanded portion of the frond. Also used to
describe the main part of a kelp plant.
frugivore
An organism that generally eats fruits, e.g.,
the fruit bat.
See also HERBIVORE.
fruit
A mature or ripened ovary or cluster of ovaries
in a flower.
fruiting body
The organ in which meiosis occurs
and sexual spores are produced in fungi and mycobac-
teria. They are distinct in size, shape, and coloration
for each species.
functional group
Organic compounds are thought
of as consisting of a relatively unreactive backbone, for
example a chain of sp3 (three p orbitals with the s
orbital) hybridized carbon atoms, and one of several
functional groups. The functional group is an atom, or
a group of atoms, that has similar chemical properties
whenever it occurs in different compounds. It defines
the characteristic physical and chemical properties of
families of organic compounds.
Fungi
A
kingdom of heterotrophic, single-celled,
multinucleated, or multicellular organisms that include
yeasts, molds, and mushrooms; organisms that lack
chlorophyll, cannot photosynthesize, and get their
nutrients directly from other organisms by being para-
sites or from dead organic matter, acting as sapro-
phytes. Molds, yeasts, mildews, rusts, smuts, and
mushrooms are all fungi. Fungi have a true nucleus
enclosed in a membrane and chitin in the cell wall.
There are about 8,000 fungi known to attack plants.
Some fungi are pathogenic to humans and other ani-
mals. Some molds, in particular, release toxic chemicals
called mycotoxins that can result in poisoning or death.

fur (ferric uptake regulator)
The iron uptake regulat-
ing protein present in PROKARYOTEs, which binds
simultaneously Fe and DNA, thereby preventing the
biosynthesis of ENZYMEs for the production of SCAV-
ENGER chelates (SIDEROPHOREs).
See also CHELATION.

gall (hypertrophies)
An abnormal swelling, growth,
or tumor found on certain meristematic (growing)
plant tissues caused by another organism such as para-
sites, insects, bacteria, fungi, viruses, injuries, or chemi-
cals. There are hundreds of types of galls, and insects
and mites are the most common organisms that cause
them. The plant interacts with the attacking organism
and provides raw materials to construct the gall via
abnormal tissue growth. Many galls provide food and
protective housing for various species of insects, and
the resulting larvae that hatch are used as food by
birds. Galls have been used for dyes, tannin for leather
processing, medicines, and even food. There are over
1,400 species of insects that produce galls, and these
insects collectively are called cecidozoa. Gallic acid was
first isolated from oak leaf galls by the Swedish chemist
Karl Scheele in 1786.
Galton, Sir Francis (1822–1911) British Anthropol-
ogist, Explorer
Francis Galton has the distinction of
being the half cousin of another prominent scientist of
the 19th century, Charles Darwin. Galton is known as
the founder of biometry and eugenics.
He was born in 1822, the youngest of seven chil-
dren, into a wealthy Quaker family in Sparkbrook,
near Birmingham, to Samuel Tertius Galton, a banker,
and Frances Anne Violetta Darwin, the half sister of
the physician and poet Erasmus Darwin, father of
Charles Darwin, who would later influence greatly the
mind of Francis.
He was homeschooled by his invalid sister Adele
until he was five and was reading at an early age,
appearing to have close to instant recall. He later
attended King Edward’s School in Birmingham
between 1836 and 1838, and then became an assistant
to the major surgeon in the general hospital of that
city at age 16. He continued his medical education by
attending King’s College in London, and by 1840 he
was attending Trinity College in Cambridge, although
his attention was moving from medicine to mathemat-
ics. He never finished his studies due to a nervous
breakdown and the stress from taking care of a termi-
nally ill father.
By 1865 Galton had become keenly interested in
genetics and heredity and was influenced by his cousin
Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species in 1859. In
Galton’s Hereditary Genius (1869) he presented his evi-
dence that talent is an inherited characteristic. In 1872
he took on religion with Statistical Inquiries into the
Efficacy of Prayer. Dalton created the study of eugen-
ics, the scientific study of racial improvement, and a
term he coined, to increase the betterment of humanity
through the improvement of inherited characteristics,
or as he defined it: “the study of agencies, under social
control, that may improve or impair the racial qualities
of future generations, either physically or mentally.”
His thoughts on improving human society became
widely admired.
Galton contributed to other disciplines and
authored several books and many papers. In fact,
between 1852 and 1910, he published some 450 papers
137
G

and books in the fields of travel and geography, anthro-
pology, psychology, heredity, anthropometry, statistics,
and more. Twenty-three publications alone were on the
subject of meteorology.
He became interested in the use of fingerprinting
for identification and published Finger Prints, the first
comprehensive book on the nature of fingerprints and
their use in solving crime. He verified the uniqueness
and permanence of fingerprints, and suggested the first
system for classifying them based on grouping the pat-
terns into arches, loops, and whorls.
As late as 1901, close to 80 years old, he delivered
a lecture “On the Possible Improvement of the Human
Breed Under Existing Conditions of Law and Senti-
ment,” to the Anthropological Institute, and he even
returned to Egypt for one more visit. He published his
autobiography, Memories of My life, in 1908 and was
knighted the following year. Galton received a number
of honors in addition to the ones already cited. He was
a member of the Athenaeum Club (1855). He received
honorary degrees from Oxford (1894) and Cambridge
(1895) and was an honorary fellow of Trinity College
(1902). He was awarded several medals that included
the Huxley Medal of the Anthropological Institute
(1901), the Darwin-Wallace Medal of the Linnaean
Society (1908), and three medals from the Royal Soci-
ety: the Royal (1886), Darwin (1902), and Copley
(1910) medals.
Galton lived with a grandniece in his later years,
and a month short of his 89th birthday, in 1911, his
heart gave out during an attack of bronchitis at
Grayshott House, Haslemere, in Surrey. He is buried in
the family vault at Claverdon, near Warwick, Warwick-
shire. Galtonia candicans, a white bell-flowered mem-
ber of the lily family from South Africa, and commonly
known as the summer hyacinth, was named for Galton
in 1888.
gametangium
A reproductive organ that produces
gametes (reproductive cells); nuclei that fuse and pro-
duce sexual spores in algae, fungi, mosses, and ferns.
gamete
A haploid (half the number of chromo-
somes) sex cell, either male (sperm) or female (egg),
that fuses with another sex cell during the process of
fertilization.
gametophyte
For plants with alternation of genera-
tions, the gametophytic generation has haploid nuclei
and generates gametes during mitosis.
See also SPOROPHYTE.
gamma band
Identical to SORET BAND.
ganglion
A knot or cyst of fibrous material in fluid
in joints and tendons; also a cluster of nerve cells locat-
ed outside the central nervous system. In invertebrates,
ganglia and nerve bundles make up the central nervous
system.
See also NEURON.
gap junction
A site between two cells that allows
small molecules or ions to cross through and connect
between the two cytoplasms; allows electrical poten-
tials between the two cells.
See also CELL.
gastrin
A hormone (linear peptide) produced and
regulated by the pyloric gland area of the stomach that
stimulates the secretion of gastric acids from the stom-
ach walls and duodenum after eating. It is synthesized
in G cells in the gastric pits located in the antrum
region of the stomach. It occurs in the body in several
forms. Gastrin is released after the eating of food con-
taining peptides, certain amino acids, calcium, coffee,
wine, beer, and others.
Too much secretion of gastrin, or hypergastrine-
mia, is a cause of a severe disease known as Zollinger-
Ellison syndrome, which affects both humans and
dogs. It creates gastric and duodenal ulceration from
excessive and unregulated secretion of gastric acid, but
it is also commonly brought on by the action of gas-
trin-secreting tumors (gastrinomas), which develop in
the pancreas or duodenum. The hormone also stimu-
lates the proliferation of gastrointestinal cells and ade-
nocarcinomas (cancer of glandular linings) of the
gastrointestinal tract.
gastropod
The most successful and largest class of
mollusks (phylum Mollusca). There are more than
138
gametangium

35,000 living species, and about half that number in
the fossil record. Most gastropods travel by using a
large flattened muscular foot and are univalve (one-
piece shell), although a few have no shell. Gastropods
have a defined head with a mouth and one or a pair of
sensory tentacles. Examples of gastropods are snails
and slugs.
gastrovascular cavity
A body cavity in certain
lower invertebrates such as cnidarians and flatworms
that serves for both digestion and circulation. It has a
single opening that serves as both mouth and anus.
Since lower invertebrates do not have a circulatory sys-
tem, it also functions to distribute nutrients to cells that
line the cavity.
gastrula
An animal embryo in an early stage of
development, between blastula and embryonic axes,
forming the characteristic three cell layers of endoderm,
mesoderm, and ectoderm, and which will give rise to
all of the major tissue systems of the adult animal.
See also EMBRYO.
gastrulation
The rearrangement of the germ layers
by the blastoderm during animal development to the
new positions in the embryo that will produce the three
primary germ layers of endoderm, mesoderm, and ecto-
derm.
gated ion channel
A specific ion channel that opens
and closes to allow the cell to alter its membrane
potential. An ion channel is a membrane protein that
forms an aqueous pore so that charged ions can cross
through the membrane. There are several types of ion
channels. For example, a ligand-gated ion channel is
where gating is controlled by binding of a chemical sig-
nal (the ligand) to a specific binding site on the channel
protein. Other ion channels are voltage gated and
mechanically gated.
gel electrophoresis
The analytical laboratory pro-
cess to separate molecules according to their size. The
sample is put on an end of a slab of polymer gel, a
lyophilic colloid that has coagulated to a jelly. An elec-
tric field is applied through the gel, which separates the
molecules; small molecules pass easily and move
toward the other end faster than larger ones. Eventual-
ly all sizes get sorted, since molecules with similar elec-
tric charges and density will migrate together at the
same rate. There are several types of gel composition,
and various chemicals can be added to help separation.
gene
Structurally, a basic unit of hereditary material;
an ordered SEQUENCE of NUCLEOTIDE bases that encodes
one polypeptide chain (via mRNA). The gene includes,
however, regions preceding and following the coding
region (leader and trailer) as well as (in EUKARYOTES)
intervening sequences (INTRONs) between individual
gene

coding segments (EXONs). Functionally, the gene is
defined by the cis-trans test that determines whether
independent MUTATIONs of the same phenotype occur
within a single gene or in several genes involved in the
same function.
See also CHROMOSOME.
genealogy
The study of one’s family and finding and
recording the complete history of all ancestors within
that family.
gene amplification
The selective increase or produc-
tion of multiple copies of a specific gene in an organism
without a proportional increase in others; specific
DNA sequences are replicated disproportionately
greater than their representation in the parent
molecules. For example, a tumor cell amplifies, or
copies, DNA segments naturally as a result of cell sig-
nals or sometimes because of environmental events.
gene cloning
A method for making identical copies
of a particular DNA; the process of asexually synthesiz-
ing multiple copies of a particular DNA sequence, or
cells (clones), using a bacteria cell or another organism
as a host. The clones are genetically identical to the par-
ent or donor cells. Cloning is used for biomedical
research in the form of extracting stem cells in humans
with the hope of gaining knowledge on the development
of and cure for human diseases. Cloning for producing
children and for medical research is controversial, and
the ethics of such practices are being debated constantly.
gene expression
A term describing the process of
translating information in DNA into an organism’s
traits. A process by which a gene’s code affects the cell
in which it is found by synthesizing a protein or RNA
product that exerts its effects on the phenotype of the
organism. Expressed genes are transcribed into mRNA
and translated into protein or transcribed into mRNA
but not translated into protein.
gene flow
The exchange of genes between different
but usually related populations. Gene flow happens
when an individual or group of individuals migrates
from one population to another, or vice versa, and
interbreeds with its members.
See also GENETIC DRIFT.
gene pool
The total genetic information in all the
genes and combinations in a breeding population at a
given time.
generation time
The time needed to complete one
generation. A generation spans from a given stage in a
life cycle to the same stage in the offspring.
gene therapy
A treatment of disease, to correct
genetic disorders, by replacing damaged or abnormal
genes with new normal ones, or by providing new
genetic instructions to help fight disease through the use
of recombinant DNA technology. Therapeutic genes are
transferred into the patient via a weakened virus, a non-
viral vector, or direct delivery of “naked” DNA. Germ
line or heritable gene therapy is used for modification of
reproductive cells. Somatic cell or noninheritable gene
therapy involves those other than reproductive cells.
genetic code
The language of genetics. The instruc-
tions in a gene that tell the cell how to make a specific
protein. The code defines the series of nucleotides in
DNA, read as triplets called codons, that specifies the
sequence of amino acids in a protein. The set comprises
64 nucleotide triplets (codons) that specify the 20
amino acids and termination codons (UAA, UAG,
UGA).
The code is made up of adenine (A), thymine (T),
guanine (G), and cytosine (C), the nucleotide bases of
DNA. Each gene’s code combines them in various ways
to spell out three-letter triplets (codons) that specify
which amino acid is needed at each step in making a
protein.
See also DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID.

over time from one generation to another as the genetic
makeup of a population drifts at random over time

instead of being shaped by natural selection in a non-
random way. Especially prevalent in small populations,
where a particular allele can be eliminated by chance
and certain alleles can be favored over time. This can
lead to the loss of genetic variability.
genetic engineering
A process that changes the
genetic makeup of cells. During the process a gene is
isolated, modified, and put back into an individual of
the same or different species. The process can be used
to introduce or eliminate specific genes. Used in agri-
culture where plants can be genetically engineered to
resist a pest.
genetic map (DNA map)
A chromosome map that
shows the order of and distance between genes. Useful
for finding inherited diseases by following the inheri-
tance of a DNA marker present in affected individuals.
Genetic maps have been used to find the exact chro-
mosomal location of disease genes, including cystic
fibrosis, sickle-cell disease, Tay-Sachs disease, fragile 
X syndrome, and myotonic dystrophy. Genetic maps
can be cytogenetic, linkage, or physical. A cytogenetic
map produces a visual appearance of a chromosome
when stained and examined under a microscope.
Important are the visually distinct regions, called light
and dark bands, that give each of the chromosomes 
a unique appearance. A linkage map is a map of the
relative positions of genetic loci on a chromosome,
determined on the basis of how often the loci are
inherited together. Distance is measured in centimor-
gans (cM). A physical map of a species shows the 
specific physical locations of its genes and/or markers
on each chromosome.
genetic recombination
The process where offspring
have a different genotype from that of the parent due
to the recombining of genetic materials, usually caused
by crossing over between homologous chromosomes
during meiosis, or random orientation of nonhomolo-
gous chromosomes pairs, gene conversion, or other
means. It occurs during the cell division (meiosis) that
occurs during the formation of sperm and egg cells.
This shuffling of genetic material increases the potential
for genetic diversity.
genetics
The scientific study of heredity and variation.
genome
The complete assemblage of chromosomes
and extrachromosomal genes of a cell, organelle, organ-
ism, or virus; the complete DNA portion of an organism;
the complete set of genes shared by members of any
reproductive body such as a population or species.

genomic imprinting
Occurs when DNA receives
biochemical marks instructing a cell how and when to
express certain genes. Resulting gene expression is usu-
ally from one copy of a gene, either from the maternal
or paternal gene.
genomic library
A collection of clones made from a
set of randomly generated overlapping DNA fragments
that represents the entire genome of an organism.
genotype
The complete genetic makeup of an organ-
ism, which may not show in physical appearance; the
pair of alleles at a particular locus. The percentage of a
particular genotype in a population is called the geno-
type frequency. Also, in taxonomy, the type species of a
genus.
See also PHENOTYPE.
genus
Taxonomic classification of a group of related
or similar objects or organisms. A genus has one or
more species. Groups of similar genera, plural of genus,
make up a family. In the scientific name of an organ-
ism, it is the first word followed by a second word to
complete the binomial. For example, Homo is the
genus name for humans, while the entire binomial,
Homo sapiens, is the species name. Genus and species
names are italicized.
See also TAXON.
geographic range
The total area or range occupied
by a species or population.
geological time
The span of time that has passed
since the creation of the Earth and its components; a
scale used to measure geological events millions of
years ago. Measured in chronostratic or relative
terms, where subdivisions of the Earth’s geology are
set in an order based on (a) relative age relationships
based on fossil composition and stratigraphic position
or (b) chronometric or absolute time where the use of
radiometric dating techniques give numerical ages.

geosynclines
A large, down-warped, generally linear
basin or trough found in the Earth’s crust where large
amounts of sediment and volcanic material have accu-
mulated; can be folded into mountains. A miogeocline
is a geosyncline in which volcanism is not associated
with sedimentation.
geotropism (gravitropism)
A
plant’s response to
gravitational effects. A plant’s roots grow downward
toward the gravitational pull, a characteristic called
positive geotropism, while shoots grow upward against
gravitational pull, a feature referred to as negative
geotropism.

germination
Sprouting of a seed; the first stages in
the growth of a seed from a seedling to an adult. After
germination the embryonic shoot emerges and grows
upward while the embryonic root grows downward.
Food for germination is located in the endosperm tissue
within the seed and or seed leaves. Sprouting of pollen
grains on a stigma and growth of fungus or algal
spores are examples of germination.
See also FERTILIZATION.
gestalt
Grasping an overall concept without under-
standing the details; perceiving the whole or patterns
over that of the pieces, e.g., the tune of a song. It is
based on an object or thing, its context in the environ-
ment, and the relationship between it all. Gestalt is
German for configuration or figure.
g-factor
See ELECTRON PARAMAGNETIC RESONANCE
SPECTROSCOPY.
gibberellins
A group of about 50 hormones or
growth regulators that primarily stimulate cell division
and elongation in plants. Gibberellic acid (GA), the
first of this class to be discovered, causes extreme elon-
gation (bolting) of stems. Gibberellins are also involved
in flower, fruit, and leaf enhancements, germination,
and vernalization (temperature effects).
giemsa stain
Stains developed specifically for the
phosphate groups of DNA in which the staining of
chromosomes produces light and dark bands charac-
teristic for each chromosome, called g-bands. Each
homologous chromosome pair has a unique pattern of
g-bands, enabling easy recognition of particular chro-
mosomes. Also used for looking for Schuffner’s dots,
which are small, red-staining granules in red-blood-
cell cytoplasm infected with either Plasmodium vivax
or P. ovale.
gigantism
Animals that evolve on islands are affect-
ed by gigantism or dwarfism, the evolution of body
form as either large (e.g., Komodo dragon weighs up to
365 pounds) or small (e.g., Island fox in Channel
Islands). Island animal populations tend to acquire dif-
ferent sizes from their mainland counterparts. Gigan-
tism is also the condition of too much growth hormone
production in humans where people grow taller than
normal.
See also DWARFISM.
gill
A respiratory organ in aquatic animals; an out-
fold of epidermal tissue; the gas-exchange surface of
many aquatic animals; a filamentous outgrowth with
blood vessels where gas exchanges (oxygen and carbon
dioxide) between water and blood. A bony structure
supporting the gill filaments is called the gill arch. A
flap of bony plates that cover the gills of bony fish is
called the gill cover, or operculum.
In fish, gill slits are openings or clefts between the
gill arches. Water is taken in by the mouth and then
passes through the gill slits and bathes the gills. Gills
are also rudimentary grooves in the neck region of
embryos of air-breathing vertebrates like humans. A
gill is also the part of fungi that contains the basidia,
the reproductive cell (meiotangium) that typically pro-
duces four spores on the outside.
gizzard
Part of an animal gut, e.g., in birds, that is
specialized for grinding and mixing food with digestive
enzymes. Also called the gastric mill.
glaciation
A long period of time characterized by cli-
matic conditions associated with maximum expanse of
ice sheets. The process of glaciers spreading over the
land. In North America, the most recent glacial event is
the Wisconsin glaciation, which began about 80,000
years ago and ended around 10,000 years ago. Most
glacial ice today is found in the polar regions, above
the Arctic and Antarctic Circles.
gland
A group of cells (organ), or a single cell in ani-
mals or plants, that is specialized to secrete a specific
substance such as a hormone, poison, or other sub-
stance. Two types of animal glands are endocrine and
exocrine. Endocrine glands place their products directly
146
germination

into the blood stream, while exocrine use a duct or net-
work into the body. Glands important to the human
body are the hypothalamus, which secretes hormones
to regulate the pituitary gland; the pineal gland, which
secretes melatonin, a hormone that deals with daily
biological rhythms; the pituitary gland, which secretes
hormones that influence other glands and organs that
deal with growth and reproduction; the thyroid gland,
which regulates metabolism and blood calcium levels;
the parathyroid gland, which regulates the use of calci-
um and phosphorus; the thymus gland, which stimu-
lates the immune system’s T cell development; the
adrenal gland, which secretes the male hormone,
androgens, and aldosterone, which helps maintain the
body’s salt and potassium balances, and epinephrine
(adrenaline) and norepinepherine (noradrenaline); the
pancreas gland, which secretes insulin, which controls
the use of sugar in the body, and other hormones
involved with sugar metabolism; the ovaries, which
secrete female hormones such as estrogen, which main-
tains female traits, and progesterone for pregnancy; the
eccrine gland, whose excretory canal emerges directly
onto the skin’s surface; the exocrine gland, which
secretes products that get directly eliminated, at the
level of the skin, or through a mucous membrane; and
the holocrine gland, whose secretions result from the
destruction of the cells forming it.
A plant gland is usually a bump, depression, or
appendage on the surface or within that produces a
sticky or greasy viscous fluid such as oil or resin. The
floral nectary is a gland in the flower that secretes a
sugary fluid that pollinators utilize for food, while the
extrafloral nectary is a gland on the nonflower part
that secretes a sugary fluid that serves the same pur-
pose. A gland-dot is a tiny pore that secretes fluid;
glandular hairs bear glands. Oil glands can often be
seen on a plant’s areole, and irregular (not round) leaf
oil glands can be either an island oil gland that is not
connected to veinlets or an intersectional oil gland that
is connected to veinlets.
glaucoma
A disease of the eye characterized by loss
of vision due to an increase in the pressure of fluid
within the eye (intraocular pressure) that leads to dam-
age to the optic nerve and loss of vision in both eyes.
Can eventually lead to blindness. The disease affects
about 6 million people worldwide. In the United States,
about 3 million people are affected.
glial cell
Nonimpulse-conducting cells that make up
half the weight of the brain; in the central nervous sys-
tem they are 10 times as numerous as neurons and act
as support cells by forming insulation around the neu-
rons to protect them. Their support functions provide
myelin for axons, and they act as housekeepers after
cell damage or death by cleaning up. Glial cells also
play an important role in the early and continuing
development of the brain. A small hormonelike protein,
glial cell

called the glial growth factor, induces the growth of
glial cells. A type of brain tumor that forms in the glial
tissue is called glioblastoma multiform.
There are several types of glial cells in the central
nervous system, including oligodendrocytes, astrocytes,
and microglia. It is the oligodendrocytes that produce
the fatty protein myelin that insulates the axons by
wrapping them in layers of myelin. Star-shaped astro-
cytes lay down scar tissue on damaged neurons and
hold the neurons in place as well as supply potassium
and calcium and regulate neurotransmitter levels.
Along with microglia cells, astrocytes remove dead cells
and other matter from the central nervous system.
Similar functionary types of cells in the peripheral
nervous system are the Schwann (provide insulation via
myelin) and satellite cells (support cells).
A debilitating disease caused by the demyelinating
of neurons is multiple sclerosis, and stem-cell research
is being conducted into developing new treatments.
glomerulus
A structure, a tiny ball, between the
afferent arterioles and efferent arterioles within the
proximal part of the nephron of the kidney; located
within the Bowman’s capsule. It is composed of a clus-
ter of capillary blood vessels and is involved in the fil-
tration of blood. The glomerulus is a semipermeable
structure that allows water and soluble wastes to pass
through and then discharges them out of the Bowman’s
capsule as urine waste at a rate of about 160 liters or
42.7 gallons per 24-hour period. Most of this is reab-
sorbed back into the blood. The filtered blood then
leaves the glomerulus by way of the efferent arteriole to
the interlobular vein. Each kidney contains about 1
million glomeruli. Changes in the glomerulus may be
responsible for diabetic kidney disease.
Also a nest of nerves in invertebrates found in
invertebrate olfactory processing centers; a discrete,
globular mesh of densely packed dendrites and axons
found in the vertebrate olfactory bulb.
glucagon
A protein hormone released by the pan-
creas via alpha cells in the islets of Langerhans with the
purpose of breaking down glycogen, in the liver, which
releases glucose and increases blood levels of glucose.
Glucagon works with insulin to maintain normal blood
sugar levels.
glucocorticoid
A class of stress-related steroids (hor-
mones) produced by the adrenal glands (cortex) that
respond to the stimulation by adrenocorticotropic hor-
mone (ACTH) that comes from the pituitary gland.
They are involved in carbohydrate, lipid, and protein
metabolism by promoting gluconeogenesis and the for-
mation of glycogen, as well as effects on muscle tone,
circulation, blood pressure, and more. They possess anti-
inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Corti-
sol (hydrocortisone) is the major natural glucocorticoid.
Synthetically produced ones—mostly derived from
cortisol, such as cortinsone, prednisone, prednisolone,
methylprednisolone, betamethasone, and dexametha-
sone—regulate metabolism of lipids, carbohydrates,
and protein and work without the use of ACTH.
Glucocorticoids also cause osteoporosis, weight
gain, cataracts, heart disease, diabetes, and psychosis.
glucose
A form of six carbon sugar (C6H12O6) that is
the most common energy source and is the usual form
in which carbohydrates are assimilated by animals. It is
carried through the bloodstream and is made not only
148
glomerulus

glomerulus. The glomerulus is a tight ball of capillaries where
blood passing through the kidneys is filtered. Fluid passes out of
the capillaries into the cavity of the surrounding Bowman’s cap-
sule (not seen) and drains into a long tube, from which essential
substances and some water are reabsorbed. The remaining
unwanted fluid, containing toxins from the blood, drains to the
bladder as urine. Magnification unknown. (Courtesy © Science

from carbohydrates but from fats and protein as well.
Glucose is known as a dextrorotatory sugar (a chiral
molecule that rotates plane-polarized light to the right),
which is sweet, colorless, and soluble.
glycocalyx
A
thick, (7.5–200 nm) extracellular,
sticky coating of oligosaccharides linked to plasma
membrane glycoprotein and glycolipids; found around
the outside of eukaryote cells, and used to adhere to
surfaces. Also called the cell coat.
glycogen
A
large polysaccharide; stored energy
found in the muscles and liver. It consists of many
monosaccharide glucose molecules linked together and
is used as a fuel during exercise, broken down as need-
ed; glycogen is the primary storage form of glucose in
animals. Also known as stored sugar or animal starch.
glycolysis
The anaerobic pathway or enzymatic conver-
sion (using 11 different enzymes) in the cell’s cytoplasm of
glucose to simpler compounds. Glucose, a six-carbon
sugar, is converted into two molecules of pyruvic acid of
three carbons each, with two molecules of NADH and
two ATPs as by-products. It is the most universal and
basic energy harvesting system; it transforms glucose into
lactic acid in muscles and other tissues for energy produc-
tion when there is not enough oxygen available.
In aerobic respiration, the two pyruvic acids are
further used in the KREBS CYCLE.

glycoprotein (conjugated protein)
Glycoproteins are
complexes in which carbohydrates are attached cova-
lently to asparagine (N-glycans) or serine/threonine (O-
glycans) residues of peptides. A protein coated with a
sugar is termed glycosylated and is described or named
with the initials “gp” along with its molecular weight,
e.g., gp160. Several gps are associated with HIV infec-
tion, since they are the outer-coat proteins of HIV:
gp41 plays a key role in HIV’s infection of CD4+ T
cells by facilitating the fusion of the viral and cell mem-
branes. The protein gp120 is one of the proteins that
forms the envelope of HIV; it projects from the surface
of HIV and binds to the CD4 molecule on helper T
cells. GPs are found in mucus and mucins, y-globulins,
a1-globulins, a2-globulins, and transferrin, an ion-
transporting protein. They act as receptors for molecu-
lar signals originating outside the cell. Attachment of
oligosaccharides to peptides increases solubility, covers
the antigenic domains, and protects the peptide back-
bone against proteases.

Golgi, Camillo (1843–1926) Italian Medical Teacher
Camillo Golgi was born in Corteno, near Brescia, Italy,
on July 7, 1843, the son of a physician. He studied
medicine at the University of Pavia, and after graduat-
ing in 1865, he continued working in Pavia at the Hos-
pital of St. Matteo. Golgi was influenced by the
scientific methods of Giulio Bizzozero, who introduced
general pathology in the programs of the medical
school at the University of Pavia. In 1872 Golgi accept-
ed the post of chief medical officer at the Hospital for
the Chronically Sick at Abbiategrasso and began his
investigations into the nervous system.
Golgi returned to the University of Pavia as
extraordinary professor of histology, left the university,
and returned as the chair for general pathology in
1881, succeeding his teacher Bizzozero. He also mar-
ried Donna Lina, a niece of Bizzozero.
Golgi developed an interest in the causes of malaria
and determined the three forms of the parasite and
their associated fevers. He developed a photographic
technique to document the most characteristic phases
of malaria in 1890.
While Golgi never practiced medicine, he was a
famous and popular teacher as director of the Depart-
ment of General Pathology at St. Matteo Hospital. He
also founded and directed the Instituto Sieroterapico-
Vaccinogeno of the Province of Pavia. Golgi also
became rector of Pavia University and was made a sen-
ator of the Kingdom of Italy.
During World War I, he assumed the responsibility
for a military hospital in Pavia and created a neu-
ropathological and mechanotherapeutical center for the
study and treatment of peripheral nervous lesions and
for the rehabilitation of the wounded.
His greatest contribution seems to be his revolu-
tionary method of staining individual nerve and cell
structures, known then as the “black reaction” and
now called Golgi staining. It allowed a clear visualiza-
tion of a nerve cell body with all its processes.
Golgi shared the Nobel Prize for 1906 with Santia-
go Ramón y Cajal for their work on the structure of the
nervous system. He retired in 1918 but remained as
professor 
emeritus 
at 
the 
University 
of 
Pavia. 
The Historical Museum at the University of Pavia dedi-
cated a hall to Golgi, where more than 80 certificates of
honorary degrees, diplomas, and awards are exhibited.
Golgi’s discovery of the black reaction and further
research provided a major contribution to the advance-
ment of the knowledge on the structural organization
of nerve tissues. He also described the morphological
features of glial cells and the relationships between
their processes and blood vessels; described two funda-
mental types of nerve cells today called Golgi type I
and Golgi type II; discovered the Golgi tendon organs;
explained the cycle of plasmodium (malaria) and the
cell organelle, today called the Golgi apparatus.
Golgi died at Pavia on January 21, 1926. In 1994
the Italian Ufficio Principale Filatelico issued a stamp
to celebrate his work.
Golgi apparatus or complex
Part of a cell, a cup- or
disclike organelle in cells, usually near the nucleus and
composed of a number of flattened or folded sacs, called
cisternae, with vacuoles and vesicles. They act as an
assembly line in sorting, modifying, and packaging pro-
teins and lipids produced on the endoplasmic reticulum,
150
glycoprotein

located in the cytoplasm of the cell, for various parts of
the cell. Named after the Nobel Prize recipient, Italian
neurologist and histologist Camillo Golgi (1843–1926).
They are the formation site of the carbohydrate side
chains of GLYCOPROTEINS and mucopolysaccharides. The
vacuoles release these by migrating through the cell mem-
brane. Some of the vesicles send molecules to the cellular
membrane, where they are excreted, and some are used
for selective excretion.
gonadotropins
A group of hormones that are pro-
duced in the pituitary gland and regulate the develop-
ment and function of the testis and ovary. The group
includes the follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which
promotes male and female gamete formation, and
luteinizing hormone (LH), which stimulates the secre-
tion of the male and female testosterone and estrogen.
Gonadotropin itself is controlled by the gonadotropin
releasing hormone (GnRH), a hormone that controls
the production and release of gonadotropins and is
secreted by the hypothalamus every 90 minutes or so,
which enables the pituitary to secrete LH and FSH.
gonads
The male and female sex organs. In the male,
they are glands located inside the scrotum, behind and
below the penis, which produce sperm and are the pri-
mary source of testosterone. Also called the testes. In
the female, they are ovaries, two almond-sized glands
located on either side of the uterus. They produce and
store the oocytes and the female sex hormones estrogen
and progesterone.
Gondwanaland (Gondwana)
The 
large 
southern
protocontinent, derived from the supercontinent Pan-
gaea, that, when fragmented, formed Africa, South
America, Antarctica, Australia, and India during the
Paleozoic era more than 200 million years ago as an
event of plate tectonics (continental drift).
G protein
A class of heterotrimeric proteins important
in signaling pathways in the plasma membrane in mam-
malian cells. Regulated by the guanine nucleotides GDP
(guanosine diphosphate) and GTP (guanosine triphos-
phate), they participate in cell signal pathways by usually
binding a hormone or signal ligand to a seven-pass trans-
membrane receptor protein; activates intracellular mes-
senger systems when the signaling molecule (typically a
hormone) binds to the transmembrane receptor. The pro-
teins are located on the inner surface of the plasma mem-
brane and transmit signals from outside the membrane,
via transmembrane receptors, to adenylate cyclase, which
then catalyzes the formation of the second messenger,
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (AMP), inside the cell.
graded potential
A nerve impulse that is initially
proportional to the intensity of the stimulus that pro-
duces it, then declines in intensity; membrane potentials
that vary in magnitude.
gradualism
An Earth model of evolution that
assumes a slow, steady rate of change, with slow steps
instead of quick leaps, and with new variation arising
by mutation and recombination. A view held by
Charles Darwin.
grafting
The process of attaching two different plant
parts, usually shoots, to each other to create a single
new plant. Used in propagating trees and shrubs.
Gram staining
An important laboratory technique
to distinguish between two major bacterial groups,
based on stain retention by their cell walls. Bacteria
smears are fixed by flaming, then stained with 
crystal violet followed by iodine solution, and then
rinsed with alcohol or acetone, decolorized, and coun-
terstained with safranin. Gram-positive bacteria are
stained bright purple or purple-black, while gram-nega-
tive bacteria are pink. This staining technique is useful
in bacterial taxonomy and identification and in indicat-
ing fundamental differences in cell-wall structure.
Gram-negative bacteria lack peptidoglycan in the cell
wall, while gram-positive bacteria have about 90 per-
cent of their cell wall composed of peptidoglycan.
See also BACTERIA.
granum
A series of disk- or saclike structures called
thaylakoid disks—specialized membrane structures
granum
151

located in the inner membrane of chloroplasts—where
photosynthesis takes place. They appear as green gran-
ules under a microscope and contain the light-reactant
chemicals chlorophyll and carotenoid pigments. ATP is
generated during photosynthesis by chemiosmosis.
gravid
Used in relation to pregnant insects and
meaning heavy with fully developed eggs or denoting
an advanced stage of pregnancy.
gravitropism
The ability of an organism or specific
cells to respond, e.g., bend, to the gravitational pull; a
growth curvature induced by gravity.
See also GEOTROPISM.

greenhouse effect
The warming of an atmosphere
by its absorbing and reemitting infrared radiation while
allowing shortwave radiation to pass on through.
Certain gaseous components of the atmosphere,
called greenhouse gases, transmit the visible portion of
solar radiation but absorb specific spectral bands of
thermal radiation emitted by the Earth. The theory is
that terrain absorbs radiation, heats up, and emits
longer wavelength thermal radiation that is prevented
from escaping into space by the blanket of carbon
dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
As a result, the climate warms. Because atmospheric
and oceanic circulations play a central role in the cli-
mate of the Earth, improving our knowledge about
their interaction is essential.
See also CARBON DIOXIDE.
gross primary productivity (GPP)
The total energy
fixed by plants in a community through photosynthesis
(such as repackaging inorganic energy to organic ener-
gy) per unit area per unit time; total carbon assimila-
tion by plants; total mass or weight of organic matter
created by photosynthesis over a defined time line.
ground meristem
Meristem is embryonic tissue.
Ground meristem is one of the primary meristem tis-
sues that are differentiated from the apical meristem.
The primary meristem tissues include three different
tissues: protoderm, ground meristem, and procambi-
um. The protoderm differentiates into the epidermis;
the procambium differentiates into the vascular tissue;
and the ground meristem differentiates into three
regions: the cortex, which is several layers of
parenchyma cells under the epidermis of the stem and
root; pith ray, the parenchyma cells between the vascu-
lar bundles in the primary dicot stem; and pith, which
are parenchyma cells in the center of the primary dicot
stem. Parenchyma are isodiametric cells, i.e., approxi-
mately equal in length, width, and height, that are thin
walled and not extremely specialized. Ground meris-
tem gives rise to cells of the ground tissue system. The
ground tissue of a leaf, located between the upper and
lower epidermis and specialized for photosynthesis, is
called the mesophyll.
ground tissue system
The plant tissue system that
forms most of the photosynthetic tissue in leaves, com-
posed mostly of parenchyma cells and some collenchy-
ma (elongate and thick walled in strands) and
sclerenchyma (thick, rigid, secondary walls with lignin
to provide support) cells. It is found between the epi-
dermis and surrounding the vascular tissue system.
Acts also as supporting tissue and in water and food
storage.
growth factor
A complex family of organic chemi-
cals, especially polypeptides, that bind to cell surface
receptors and act to control new cell division, growth,
and maintenance by the bone marrow.
Synthetic growth factors are being used to stimu-
late normal white blood cell production following can-
cer treatments and bone marrow transplants.
Examples of growth factors are insulin (including
insulinlike growth factor (IGF), GF1, II, all of which
152
gravid

are polypeptides similar to insulin); somatomedins,
polypeptides made by the liver and fibroblasts that,
when released into the blood (stimulated by soma-
totropin), help cell division and growth by incorporat-
ing sulfates into collagen, RNA, and DNA synthesis;
HGH (human growth hormone), also called soma-
totropin, a proteinlike hormone from the pituitary
gland that stimulates the liver to produce somato-
medins that stimulate growth of bone and muscle;
platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a glycoprotein
that stimulates cell proliferation and chemotaxis in car-
tilage, bone, and other cell types; fibroblast growth fac-
tor, which promotes the proliferation of cells of
mesodermal, neuroectodermal, epithelial, or endothe-
lial origin; epidermal growth factor (EGF), important
for cell development as it binds to receptors on cell sur-
face to create a growth signal; and granulocyte colony-
stimulating factor (G-CSF), a growth factor that
promotes production of granulocytes, a type of white
blood cell.
guanylate cyclase
An ENZYME catalyzing the con-
version of guanosine 5’-triphosphate to cyclic guano-
sine 3’,5’-monophosphate, which is involved in cellular
REGULATION processes. One member of this class is a
HEME-containing enzyme involved in processes regulat-
ed by nitrogen monoxide.
guard cell
Specialized epidermal cells; two crescent-
shaped cells on either side of the pore of a stoma in the
stem or leaf epidermis. By changing shape, i.e., by
opening and closing via changes in turgor, they regulate
gas exchange and water loss by covering or uncovering
the pore, which lets oxygen out and carbon dioxide in.
Gullstrand, Allvar (1862–1930) Swedish Ophthal-
mologist
Allvar Gullstrand was born on June 5,
1862, in Landskrona and was the eldest son of Dr. Pehr
Alfred Gullstrand, principal municipal medical officer,
and his wife Sofia Mathilda Korsell. He was educated
at schools in Landskrona and Jönköping, and he
attended Uppsala University, but left in 1885 to spend
a year at Vienna. He then continued his medical studies
at Stockholm and presented his doctorate thesis in
1890. He was appointed lecturer in ophthalmology in
1891 and was appointed the first professor of ophthal-
mology at Uppsala University in 1894. He stayed in
that position until 1914, when he was given a personal
professorship in physical and physiological optics at
Uppsala University, becoming an emeritus professor in
1927.
Gullstrand contributed a great deal to the knowl-
edge of clinical and surgical ophthalmology and of the
structure and function of the cornea of the eye, as well
as research on astigmatism, and was self-taught in this
area. He laid out his ideas in his doctoral thesis in
1890, Bidrag till astigmatismens teori (Contribution
to the theory of astigmatism) and further refined them
in Allgemeine Theorie der monochromatischen Aber-
rationen und ihre nächsten Ergebnisse für die Oph-
thalmologie
(General 
theory 
of 
monochromatic
aberrations and their immediate significance for oph-
thalmology), 1900; Die reelle optische Abbildung
(The true optical image), 1906; and Die optische
Abbildung in heterogenen Medien und die Dioptrik
der Kristallinse des Menschen (The optical image in
heterogeneous media and the dioptrics of the human
crystalline lens), 1908. Further important works
included Tatsachen und Fiktionen in der Lehre von
der optischen Abbildung (Facts and fictions in the the-
ory of the optical image), 1907; and Einführung in die
Methoden der Dioptrik der Augen des Menschen
(Introduction to the methods of the dioptrics of the
human eyes), 1911.
In 1911 he invented the slit lamp and the reflex-
free ophthalmoscope to help study the eye. He intro-
duced a surgical technique for the treatment of
symblepharon (a fibrous tract that connects the bulba
conjunctiva to conjunctiva on the eyelid) and redefined
the theory of accommodation. In 1911 he received the
Nobel Prize for his research on dioptrics of the eye,
although at first he declined it. Gullstrand died in
Stockholm on July 28, 1930. Gullstrand is seen as one
of the founders of modern ophthalmology.
guttation
A way for plants to expel water in excess
of transpiration—principally through hydathodes, a
special epidermal structure at the terminations of veins
around the margins of the leaves—and especially under
conditions of relatively high humidity. The expelled
water appears on the ends of leaves mostly on moist
cool nights and resembles dew.
guttation

gymnosperm
A
group of flowerless plants that
includes pines, conifers, redwoods, firs, yews, and
cycads. Gymnosperm means “naked seed.” Their ovules
and the seeds, which develop in them, are born unpro-
tected on the surface of megasporophylls, and are often
arranged on cones instead of being enclosed in ovaries
as in the flowering plants. They release pollen directly
into the air, which finds its way to female ovules and
fertilizes them. The earliest examples of gymnosperms
appeared during the Devonian period some 408 million
years ago and were seed ferns. Gymnosperms have
reached as high as 350 feet to as small as 4 inches in
height. Worldwide there are 20 plant families with at
least 50 percent of their species threatened. Of these,
eight are gymnosperm families (including cycads and
conifers). This may be due to the fact that many of their
species are widely exploited for both timber and horti-
cultural purposes, and, because they are an ancient
group, they may not adapt easily to the rapidly chang-
ing environment around them. There are only 720
species compared with 250,000 species of angiosperms.
See also ANGIOSPERM.
gynandromorphism
A female that develops partly
or completely male characteristics. A lateral gynandro-
morph on one side has the external characters of the
male, and the other side has those of the female. Com-
mon in bees and silkworms.
See also HERMAPHRODITE.

Haber-Weiss reaction
The Haber-Weiss cycle con-
sists of the following two reactions:
H2O2 + OH.   H2O + O2– + H+ and
H2O2 + O2–   O2 + OH– + OH.
The second reaction achieved notoriety as a possi-
ble source of hydroxyl radicals. However, it has a negli-
gible rate constant. It is believed that iron(III)
complexes can catalyze this reaction: first Fe(III) is
reduced by superoxide, followed by oxidation by dihy-
drogen peroxide.
See also FENTON REACTION.
habituation
Reaction to the repeated presentation of
the same stimulus that has no special significance and
that causes reduced attention to the stimulus. Short-
term habituation lasts for only minutes, while longer-
term habituation could last for weeks.
Haeckelian recapitulation (embryonic recapitulation)
A clade goes through, in its development, an ontoge-
netic stage that is present in the adults of its sister
group. Named for Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919), who
promoted the idea that the development of the human
embryo in the womb is a rerun (recapitulation) of the
steps in humanity’s rise from a primitive creature.
Haeckel’s views about evolution have been refuted by
most scientists.
half-life
For a given reaction the half-life, t1/2, of a
reactant is the time required for its concentration to
reach a value that is the arithmetic mean of its initial
and final (equilibrium) value. For a reactant that is
entirely consumed, it is the time taken for the reactant
concentration to fall to one-half of its initial value. For
a first-order reaction, the half-life of the reactant can be
called the half-life of the reaction. In nuclear chemistry,
(radioactive) half-life is defined, for a simple radioac-
tive decay process, as the time required for the activity
to decrease to half its value by that process.
See also BIOLOGICAL HALF-LIFE; GEOLOGICAL TIME.
haloperoxidase
A
PEROXIDASE that catalyzes the
oxidative transformation of halides to XO– (X being
Cl, Br, or I) or to organic halogen compounds. Most
are HEME proteins, but some bromoperoxidases from
algae are vanadium-containing ENZYMEs.
halophyte
A plant that has adapted to grow in salt-
rich soils or salt-rich air, e.g., glassworts (Salicornia vir-
ginica). Obligatory halophytes need salt, whereas
facultative halophytes can live in freshwater conditions
as well.
hansch analysis
The investigation of the quantitative
relationship between the biological activity of a series
of compounds and their physicochemical substituent or
155
H

global parameters representing hydrophobic, electron-
ic, steric, and other effects using multiple regression
correlation methodology.
haploid cell
A cell containing one set of chromo-
somes. Sperm and egg cells are haploid.
haplozoans
Extinct echinoderms of the Cambrian
era that include two classes, Cycloidea and Cyamoidea.
Cyamoids have bilateral symmetry, and cycloids are
dome-shaped with radial symmetry. They are quite
uncharacteristic of echinoderms, although they have a
skeletal structure that relates them. Otherwise, they
have uncertain affinities to all other echinoderms and
may provide a link between echinoderms and fish.
hapten
A molecule (usually a small organic molecule)
that can be bound to an ANTIGENic determinant/epi-
tope. Usually they are too small to give a response of
their own. They become antigenic if they are coupled to
a suitable macromolecule, such as a protein.
hapto
The hapto symbol, η (Greek eta), with numeri-
cal superscript, provides a topological description for the
bonding of hydrocarbons or other π-electron systems to
metals by indicating the connectivity between the LIGAND
and the CENTRAL
ATOM. The symbol is prefixed to 
the ligand name or to that portion of the ligand name
most appropriate. The superscript numerical index on
the right indicates the number of COORDINATING atoms
in the ligand that bind to the metal. Examples:
[PtCl2(C2H4)(NH3)] amminedichloro 
(η2-ethene)platinum
[Fe(η5-C5H5)2] bis (η5-cyclopentadienyl)iron 
(ferrocene)
See also COORDINATION.
hard acid
A LEWIS ACID with an acceptor center of
low polarizability. It preferentially associates with
HARD BASEs rather than with soft bases, in a qualitative
sense (sometimes called HSAB rule). Conversely, a soft
acid possesses an acceptor center of high polarizability
and exhibits the reverse preference for a partner for
COORDINATION.
hard base
A LEWIS BASE with a donor center of low
polarizability; the converse applies to soft bases.
See also HARD ACID.
hard drug
A nonmetabolizable compound, charac-
terized either by high lipid solubility and accumula-
tion in adipose tissues and organelles, or by high
water solubility. In the lay press, the term hard drug
refers to a powerful DRUG of abuse such as cocaine or
heroin.
Hardy-Weinberg theorem
A mathematical theorem
that describes a population that is not evolving under
certain conditions. First proposed in 1908 by G. H.
Hardy, an English mathematician, and B. W. Weinberg,
a German physician, although both were working inde-
pendently of each other. The theory describes the fre-
quencies of various genotypes in a population and the
ability to predict how the frequencies will change in
future generations based on certain assumptions not
being violated, such as the absence of mutation, the
absence of migration or selection, random mating, and
an infinite population size. In other words, in the
absence of any of these factors, the allele frequencies
and the frequencies of the different genotypes will
remain the same from one generation to the next, and
genetic recombination due to sexual reproduction will
not result in any changes in allele frequencies or geno-
type frequencies.
harelip (cleft lip)
A
congenital (birth) deformity
caused by a failure of developing tissues to fuse; a cleft
in the upper lip, found on one or both sides of the mid-
line. Often associated with a cleft palate.
haustorium
A specialized structure of a parasitic
plant or entophyte, an organism that lives at least part
of its life cycle within a host plant, that penetrates the
living host and absorbs nutrients. In parasitic fungi, it
156
haploid cell

is a hyphal tip that penetrates the host but not the cell
membrane.
Haversian system (osteon)
A structural composition
of compact bone that contains a Haversian canal, a
longitudinally arranged vascular channel in the center
of the osteon containing blood vessels and nerves;
Haversian lamella, the circumferentially arranged lay-
ers of osteoid and osteocytes surrounding the canal;
and the canaliculi, fine channels through the bone that
provide a link between osteocytes.
heart
A muscular organ composed of cardiac muscle
that pumps blood throughout the body.
heat
Kinetic energy in the process of being trans-
ferred from one object to another due to a temperature
difference. It moves in one of three ways: radiation,
conduction, or convection.
heath hen
Along with the passenger pigeon, the
heath hen (Tympanuchus cupido cupido), a relative of
the prairie chicken, is an example of extinction by
human disturbance. Last observed on March 11, 1932,
at James Green’s farm in West Tisbury, Martha’s Vine-
yard, Massachusetts, it became the victim of habitat
conversion to crops and pastureland, as well as being
hunted as game and for sport. It was a ground-
dwelling/nesting meadows seedeater ranging from
Maine to Chesapeake Bay.
See also EXTINCT SPECIES.
heat-shock proteins (HSPs)
A family of closely
related proteins, widely distributed in virtually all
organisms (plants, animals, microorganisms, and
humans). Even though they are found in widely differ-
ent sources, they show structural similarity. HSP
expression increases in response to physiological
stresses such as rise in temperature, pH changes, and
oxygen deprivation. Many of these stresses can disrupt
the three-dimensional structure, or folding, of a cell’s
proteins, and so HSPs bind to those damaged proteins,
helping them refold back into their proper shapes.
They also help newly synthesized polypeptides fold
and prevent premature interactions with other pro-
teins. HSPs, also called chaperones, aid in the trans-
port of proteins throughout the cell’s various
compartments and aid in the destruction of peptides
specific to tumors or pathogens.

the right side (left on image) serving the lungs and the left side
pushing blood around the general circulation. Oxygenated blood
entering the heart from the lungs passes through the left atrium
into the left ventricle (bottom right) before being distributed 
via the aorta (top, center). Deoxygenated blood enters the right
atrium through the venae cavae (top left) prior to being pumped

Insects and Man—An Exotic Dilemma
By Timothy L. McCabe, Ph.D.
Insects have long been recognized for their benefits as pol-
linators, honey producers, predators, and parasitoids, as
well as for pure aesthetics, such as admiring the grace and
beauty of a butterfly. They have also been recognized as
vectors of disease, agricultural pests, defoliators of forests,
bloodsuckers, and as having other characteristics unwant-
ed or not admired by humans.
Insects have only recently come to be appreciated by
the scientific community and public for what they can tell us
about the health of the environment. Their sheer diversity,
estimated at 30 million species, and numbers (the world’s
ant biomass equals the total human biomass) are evidence
of their significance. In recent times, insects have been
used for biocontrol, i.e., using one species to control the
population of another. Klamath weed (Hypericum perfora-
tum, also known as St. John’s-wort) control by a leaf beetle
is a famous example. The Klamath weed leaf beetle,
Chrysolina quadrigemina, intentionally introduced in 1946,
feeds on the foliage of this weed in both the adult and larval
stages. The Klamath weed leaf beetle has dramatically
reduced the abundance and density of this weed in areas
where fall temperatures are mild. This biological control
agent is responsible for contributing to the impressive
decline in St. John’s-wort on the Pacific coast.
Introductions have led to mistakes that are equally
dramatic. Another leaf beetle, the Colorado potato beetle
(Leptinotarsa decemlineata), was introduced from the Unit-
ed States to Europe in the late 1920s, where it has become a
serious potato pest. A parasitic fly (Compsilura) was inten-
tionally introduced to the United States in the 1920s to con-
trol a newly established and very serious forest threat, the
gypsy moth (Lymantria dispar). It took a long time for the fly
to become established, and now it is an integral part of our
fauna. However, this species of fly has five broods per year,
while the gypsy moth only has one. The fly survives for the
remainder of the year by attacking hundreds of species of
native moths and butterflies, unrelated to the gypsy moth,
and has suppressed their numbers to unprecedented low
levels. The population of this fly has been estimated at
16,000 individuals per acre in Connecticut. Clearly this
“cure” for the gypsy moth was worse than the “disease,”
having totally unexpected side effects.
The honeybee is widely acclaimed for its ability to pol-
linate and for its honey production. However, this intro-
duced bee, originally an Old World species, has displaced
and probably caused the extinction of several bees native
to the New World. The tracheal bee mite, a recent acciden-
tal introduction, possibly from the Philippines, has had a
catastrophic effect on the honeybee and honey production.
The secondary impact of tracheal mites on native bees is an
ongoing concern. The “killer” bee, an introduced strain of
the honeybee, is another matter entirely.
Not all introductions need be derived from another con-
tinent. Geographic barriers, such as the Rocky Mountains
and the Great Plains, prevent the natural spread east and
west on the North American continent. The western conifer
seed bug (Leptoglossus occidentalis) was accidentally intro-
duced from the West to a tree nursery in Iowa in 1956. From
Iowa, the bug spread throughout the northeastern United
States, reaching New York in 1992, where it has become a
nuisance due to its proclivity to overwinter in houses.
Insects are continually on the move. Even native popu-
lations exhibit periodic instability and can rapidly expand (or
contract) a range that had been stable for decades, even
centuries. The plain ringlet butterfly (Coenonympha tullia)
has been moving south from Canada at a pace of nearly 40
miles per year with no end in sight (except eventually an
ocean).
Even exotic plants have a profound impact on native
plants and consequently on the associated insects. Glaciers
“erased” the flora and fauna of the northern states thou-
sands of years ago. Species with poor dispersal mecha-
nisms have still not reinvaded since the glacial retreat
15,000 years ago. Glaciers wiped out earthworms, but intro-
duced earthworms have filled the void. One exotic earth-
worm species is so adept at removing organics that it
actually mineralizes the soil in the process of feeding. Garlic
mustard, also an introduction, loves mineralized soils and
follows the earthworms. The Virginia white butterfly (Pieris
virginiensis), a species threatened by competition with the
introduced cabbage white butterfly (Pieris rapae), has a
caterpillar that feeds on a native mustard, but the adult but-
terfly demonstrates an ovipositional preference for the
introduced garlic mustard. Its caterpillar cannot survive on
the garlic mustard, and as a consequence of this oviposi-
tional preference, this species is disappearing in the wake
of the encroaching garlic mustard. As an added insult, the
diminished quality of the forest litter beneath the garlic
mustard has led to a dramatic (more than 90 percent)
decline in ground beetles, native denizens of the forest
floor. This impact makes its way up the food chain as we
witness declines in red-backed salamanders that feed on
insects in the forest litter.
Ladybugs have been intentionally introduced with wild
abandon because of their reputation as voracious aphid
eaters. Nearly half of North America’s ladybugs are not
natives, but introductions. Our native nine-spotted ladybug

number 2. Helium is produced in stars and is the 
second most abundant element in the universe. Its
atom contains two protons, two neutrons, and two
electrons.

helix
A particular rigid left- or right-handed arrange-
ment of a polymeric chain, characterized by the num-
ber of strands, the number (n) of units per turn, and its
pitch (p), the distance the helix rises along its axis per
full turn. Examples of single-stranded helices are the
protein helices: α-helix: n = 3.6, p = 540 picometer;
310-helix: n = 3.0, p = 600 picometer; π-helix: n = 4.4,
p = 520 picometer.

helminth
A worm or wormlike organism. Three
major helminths exist that affect humans: the nema-
todes (roundworm), trematodes (flukes), and cestodes
(tapeworms).
See also PLATYHELMINTHES.
helper T cell
A type of T cell needed to turn on anti-
body production by activating cytotoxic T cells and
causing other immune responses in the body. They aid
in helping B cells to make antibodies against thymus-
dependent antigens. TH1 and TH2 helper T cells
secrete materials (interleukins and gamma interferon)
that help cell-mediated immune response.
heme
A near-planar COORDINATION complex obtained
from iron and the dianionic form of PORPHYRIN. Deriva-
tives are known with substitutes at various positions on
the ring named a, b, c, d, etc. Heme b, derived from PRO-
TOPORPHYRIN IX, is the most frequently occurring heme.
hemerythrin
A
dioxygen-carrying 
protein 
from
marine invertebrates, containing an oxo-bridged dinu-
clear iron center.

(Coccinella novemnotata), the “official” New York State
insect, was eradicated from New York by the seven-spotted
ladybug (Coccinella septempunctata), an intentionally intro-
duced European species. No nine-spotted ladybug has
been collected in New York State since the 1940s, yet it had
been a dominant species before the introduction of this
competitor. Another exotic introduction, the Asian ladybug
(Harmonia axyridis), made its way to the Northeast in the
1990s and has partially displaced the previously introduced
seven-spotted ladybug.
It is now somewhat of a rarity to see a native ladybug
in New York State. The level at which the various ladybugs
compete is not that well understood. The nine-spotted and
the seven-spotted are very close relatives, so the fact that
they compete directly should not have surprised scientists.
What is more surprising is that the distantly related Asian
ladybug displaced the nine-spotted and many others,
despite the lack of any close relationship. Parasites and
diseases of introduced insects are some of the baggage
that comes with these introductions. The introductions
have evolved a resistance or at least a tolerance to these
coevolved agents to which our native species have never
been exposed. It is smallpox at an insect level.
All the aforementioned ladybugs eat aphids, but they
can be particular about which species and in what habitats.
The diversity of native ladybug species was achieved
through natural selection. Introductions upset the balance.
We can never take back the dozens of introduced ladybugs.
If all life (not just ladybugs) from all of the earth’s conti-
nents were mixed together tomorrow, it would result in a
die-off of diversity that would parallel that of the Devonian
extinction that occurred millions of years ago. This is what
we are doing, albeit slowly, with accidental and purposeful
introductions. Once an undesirable exotic has gained a
foothold, we are caught up in a cycle of introducing preda-
tors, parasitoids, and diseases in an attempt to suppress or
eradicate the original introduction. As shown by these
examples, it often backfires.

(e.g., Saccoglossus), which burrow in sand and mud,
and pterobranchs (e.g., Rhabdopleura), tiny colonial
animals. The hemichordates have a tripartite (three-
fold) division of the body, pharyngeal gill slit, a form of
dorsal nerve cord, and a similar structure to a noto-
chord. Graptolites, which comprise the class Grap-
tolithina, are common fossils in Ordovician and
Silurian rocks and are now considered hemichordates.
hemochromatosis

hemolymph
The body circulatory fluid found in
invertebrates, functionally equivalent to the blood and
lymph of the vertebrate circulatory system.
hemophilia
An inherited clotting problem that
occurs, with few exceptions, in males. It delays coagula-
tion of the blood, making hemorrhage difficult to con-
trol. Hemophilia A, called classical or standard
hemophilia, is the most common form of the disorder
and is due to a deficiency of a factor called factor VIII
(FVIII). Hemophilia B, also called Christmas disease, is
due to a deficiency of factor IX (FIX). A person with
hemophilia does not bleed any faster than a normal per-
son, but the bleeding continues for a much longer time.
See also BLOOD.
hemorrhoids (piles)
Abnormally enlarged or dilated
veins around the anal opening.
Hench, Philip Showalter (1896–1965) American
Physician
Philip Showalter Hench was born in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, on February 28, 1896, to
Jacob Bixler Hench and Clara Showalter. After
attending local schools he attended Lafayette Col-
lege, Easton, Pennsylvania, and received a B.A. in
1916. The following year he enlisted in the U.S.
Army Medical Corps but was transferred to the
reserve corps to finish his medical training. In 1920
he received his doctorate in medicine from the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh.
He became the head of the Mayo Clinic Depart-
ment of Rheumatic Disease in 1926, and by 1947 was
professor of medicine. During World War II he
became a consultant to the army surgeon general.
During this period with the Mayo Clinic he isolated
several steroids from the adrenal gland cortex and,
working with Edward KENDALL, successfully conduct-
ed trials using cortisone on arthritic patients. Hench
also treated patients with ACTH, a hormone pro-
duced by the pituitary gland that stimulates the

hemochromatosis
Scanning electron micrograph of a human erythrocyte, or red
blood cell, tangled in fibrin. Fibrin is the insoluble form of 
fibrinogen, a coagulation factor found in solution in blood plasma.
Fibrinogen is converted to the insoluble protein fibrin when 
acted upon by the enzyme thromboplastin. Fibrin forms a fibrous
meshwork, the basis of a blood clot, which is the essential 
mechanism for the arrest of bleeding. Red blood cells contain the
pigment hemoglobin, the principal function of which is to transport
oxygen around the body. Magnification: ×6900 (at 10 × 8 in. size).

adrenal gland. He shared with Edward C. Kendall and
Tadeus REICHSTEIN the 1950 Nobel Prize in physiolo-
gy or medicine for this pioneering work in the treat-
ment of rheumatoid arthritis with cortisone and
ACTH.
He authored many papers in the field of rheuma-
tology, received numerous awards, and belonged to
several scientific organizations throughout his life. He
died on March 30, 1965, in Ocho Rios, Jamaica.
hepatic portal vessel
A system of veins that delivers
blood from glands and organs of the gastrointestinal
tract (GIT) to the liver. A portal vein enters the liver at
the porta hepatis and distributes venules and sinusoids,
capillarylike vessels where blood becomes purified,
before it goes into the inferior vena cava. The hepatic
artery carries oxygen-rich blood to the liver from the
heart and mixes with the portal vein in the sinusoids.
Thus two filtering systems, the capillaries of the GIT
and sinusoids of the liver, perform their tasks on the
blood.
herb
Part of a plant that is used for medicinal, food,
or aromatic properties.
herbivore
An animal that only eats plants to obtain
its necessary nutrients for survival.
See also CARNIVORE.
hermaphrodite
An individual with both male and
female sexual reproductive organs and that functions
as both male and female, producing both egg 
and sperm. The individual can be a simultaneous
hermaphrodite, having both types of organs at the
same time, or a sequential or successive herm-
aphrodite that has one type early in life and the other
type later. If the female part forms first it is called pro-
togynous hermaphroditism; it is called protandrous
hermaphroditism if the male forms first.
Some examples of hermaphrodites are most flukes,
tapeworms, gastrotriches, earthworms, and even some
humans.
In plants, it is when male and female organs occur
in the same flower of a single individual.
hernia
A protrusion of a tissue or organ or a part of
one through the wall of the abdominal cavity or other
area. A hiatal hernia has part of the stomach protrud-
ing through the diaphragm and up into the chest and
affects about 15 percent of the human population.
Herodotus
A Greek who lived ca. 400 B.C.E. and
observed fossil seashells in the rocks of mountains. He
interpreted these remains as once-living marine organ-
isms and concluded that these areas must have been
submerged in the past.
Hess, Walter Rudolf (1881–1973) Swiss Physiolo-
gist
Walter Rudolf Hess was born in Frauenfeld, in
Aargau Canton, Switzerland, on March 17, 1881, to a
teacher of physics. He received a doctor of medicine in
1906 from the University of Zurich.
Originally he began his career as an ophthalmolo-
gist for six years (1906–12), but dropped his practice
and turned to the study of physiology at the University
of Bonn. In 1917 he was nominated director of the
Physiological Institute at Zurich, with corresponding
teaching responsibilities, and later director of the Physi-
ological Institute (1917–51) at the University of
Zürich.
He spent most of his life investigating the responses
of behavior, respiration, and blood pressure by stimu-
lating the diencephalon of cats using his own tech-
niques. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1949 for
his work related to the diencephalon.
Among Hess’s books is The Biology of Mind
(1964). He died on August 12, 1973.
heterochromatin
Most cell nuclei contain varying
amounts of functional (active) and nonfunctional (inac-
tive) DNA. Functional DNA is called euchromatin,
while nonfunctional or inactive is called heterochro-
matin. The latter is DNA that is so tightly packaged it
cannot transcript. Two forms exist: constitutive hete-
rochromatin, where portions of the chromosome are
always inactive, and facultative heterochromatin,
where portions of the chromosome are active in some
cells at one time but are inactive now (such as the Y
chromosome and Barr bodies). A gene is closed or inac-
cessible and not expressed if it is heterochromatin.
heterochromatin
161

heterochrony
An evolutionary change in develop-
mental timing in the relative time or rate of appearance
or development of a character. The morphological out-
comes of changes in rates and timing of development
are paedomorphosis (less growth) or peramorphosis
(more growth). Peramorphosis is the extended or exag-
gerated shape of the adult descendant relative to the
adult ancestor; its later ontogenetic stages retain char-
acteristics from earlier stages of an ancestor. Paedomor-
phosis is where the adult descendant retains a more
juvenile looking shape or looks more like the juvenile
form of its adult ancestor; its development goes further
than the ancestor and produces exaggerated adult
traits. Paedomorphosis can happen as a result of begin-
ning late (postdisplacement), ending early (progensis),
or slowing in the growth rate (neoteny). Likewise, per-
amorphosis can result from starting early (predisplace-
ment), ending late (hypermorphosis), or having a
greater growth rate (acceleration).
heterocyst
A
large, thick-walled, specialized cell
working in anoxic (oxygen absent) conditions that
engages in nitrogen fixation from the air on some fila-
mentous cyanobacteria; an autotrophic organism.
heteroecious
A parasite that starts its life cycle on one
organism and then affects a second host species to com-
plete the cycle, e.g., peach-potato aphid (Myzus persicae).
heterogamy
Producing gametes of two different
types from unlike individuals, e.g., egg and sperm. The
tendency for unlike types to mate with unlike types.
heterolysis (heterolytic cleavage or heterolytic fission)
The cleavage of a bond so that both bonding electrons
remain with one of the two fragments between which
the bond is broken.
heteromorphic
Having different forms at different
periods of the life cycle, as in stages of insect metamor-
phosis and the life cycle of modern plants, where the
sporophyte and gametophyte generations have different
morphology.
Heteroptera
A suborder known as true bugs. They
have very distinctive front wings, called hemelytra. The
basal half is leathery and the apical half is membranous.
They have elongate, piercing-sucking mouthparts.
Worldwide in distribution, there are more than 50,000
species. Two families are ectoparasites. The Cimicidae
(bed bugs) live on birds and mammals including
humans, and the Polyctenidae (bat bugs) live on bats.
heteroreceptor

a directed cross between two pure-breeding plant lines.
heterosporous
Producing two types of spores differ-
ing in size and sex. Plant sporophytes that produce two
kinds of spores that develop into either male or female
gametophytes.
heterotrophic organisms
Organisms that are not
able to synthesize cell components from carbon dioxide
as a sole carbon source. Heterotrophic organisms use
preformed oxidizable organic SUBSTRATEs such as glu-
cose as carbon and energy sources, while energy is
gained through chemical processes (chemoheterotro-
phy) or through light sources (photoheterotrophy).
heterozygote
A diploid organism or cell that has
inherited different alleles, at a particular locus, from each
parent (i.e., Aa individual); a form of polymorphism.
heterozygote advantage (overdominance)

lutionary mechanism that ensures that eukaryotic het-
erozygote individuals (Aa) leave more offspring than
homozygote (AA or aa) individuals, thereby preserving

genetic variation; condition in which heterozygotes
have higher fitness than homozygotes.
heterozygous
Two different alleles of a particular
gene present within the same cell; a diploid individual
having different alleles of one or more genes producing
gametes of different genotypes.
Heymans, Corneille Jean-François (1892–1968)
Belgian Physiologist
Corneille Jean-François Heymans
was born in Ghent, Belgium, on March 28, 1892, to 
J. F. Heymans, a former professor of pharmacology and
rector of the University of Ghent, and who founded the
J. F. Heymans Institute of Pharmacology and Therapeu-
tics at the same university.
Corneille received his secondary education at the
St. Lievens College (Ghent), St. Jozefs College (Turn-
hout), and St. Barbara College (Ghent). He pursued his
medical education at the University of Ghent and
received a doctor’s degree in 1920. After graduation he
worked at various colleges until 1922, when he became
lecturer in pharmacodynamics at the University of
Ghent. In 1930 he succeeded his father as professor of
pharmacology and was appointed head of the depart-
ment of pharmacology, pharmacodynamics, and toxi-
cology; at the same time he became director of the J. F.
Heymans Institute, retiring in 1963.
His research was directed toward the physiology
and pharmacology of respiration, blood circulation,
metabolism, and pharmacological problems. He discov-
ered chemoreceptors in the cardio-aortic and carotid
sinus areas, and made contributions to knowledge of
arterial blood pressure and hypertension. He was award-
ed the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1938 for
his work on the regulatory effect of the cardio-aortic and
the carotid sinus areas in the regulation of respiration.
He wrote more than 800 scientific papers, was
active in a number of professional organizations, and
was publisher and editor-in-chief of the Archives Inter-
nationales de Pharmacodynamie et de Thérapie, found-
ed in 1895 by his father and Professor E. Gley in Paris.
He died on July 18, 1968, in Knokke.
hibernation
A physiological state of dormancy, a
sleeplike condition, that lowers body temperature,
slows the heart and breathing, and reduces the need for
food for extended periods of time, usually during peri-
ods of cold. Examples of hibernators are bears, bats,
snakes, frogs, squirrels, turtles, and some birds.

Hill, Archibald Vivian (1886–1977) British Physiol-
ogist
Archibald Vivian Hill was born in Bristol on
September 26, 1886. After an early education at Blun-
dell’s School, Tiverton, he entered Trinity College,
Cambridge, with scholarships. He studied mathematics
but was urged to go into physiology by one of his
teachers, Walter Morley Fletcher.
In 1909 he began study on the nature of muscular
contraction and the dependence of heat production on
the length of muscle fiber. From 1911 to 1914, until
the start of World War I, he continued his work on the
physiology of muscular contraction at Cambridge as
well as other studies on nerve impulse, hemoglobin,
and calorimetry.
In 1926 he was appointed the Royal Society’s
Foulerton research professor and was in charge of 
the biophysics laboratory at University College until
1952.
His work on muscle function, especially the obser-
vation and measurement of thermal changes associated
with muscle function, was later extended to similar
studies on the mechanism of the passage of nerve
impulses. He coined the term oxygen debt to describe
the process of recovery after exercise.
He discovered and measured heat production asso-
ciated with nerve impulses and analyzed physical and
chemical changes associated with nerve excitation,
among other studies. In 1922 he won the Nobel Prize
in physiology or medicine (with Otto MEYERHOF) for
work on chemical and mechanical events in muscle
contraction such as the production of heat in muscles.
This research helped establish the origin of muscular
force in the breakdown of carbohydrates while forming
lactic acid in the muscle.
His important works include Muscular Activity
(1926), Muscular Movement in Man (1927), Living
Machinery (1927), The Ethical Dilemma of Science
and Other Writings (1960), and Traits and Trials in
Physiology (1965).

He was a member of several scientific societies and
was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1918, serv-
ing as secretary for the period 1935–45, and foreign
secretary in 1946. Hill died on June 3, 1977.

A nonenzymatic chemical secreted from the
leech that prevents blood clotting. Today, the genetical-
ly engineered lepirudin and desirudin and the synthetic
bivalirudin are used as anticoagulants.
histamine
A
hormone and chemical transmitter
found in plant and animal tissues. In humans it is
involved in local immune response that will cause blood
vessels to dilate during an inflammatory response; also
regulates stomach acid production, dilates capillaries,
and decreases blood pressure. It increases permeability
of the walls of blood vessels by vasodilation when
released from mast cells and causes the common symp-
toms of allergies such as running nose and watering
eyes. It will also shut the airways in order to prevent
allergens from entering, making it difficult to breath.
Antihistamines are used to counteract this reaction.
histology
The study of the microscopic structure of
plant and animal tissue.
histone
A basic unit of chromatin structure; several
types of protein characteristically associated with the
DNA in chromosomes in the cell nucleus of eukaryotes.
They function to coil DNA into nucleosomes, which
are a combination of eight histones (a pair each of
H2A, H2B, H3, and H4) wrapped by two turns of a
DNA molecule. A high number of positively charged
amino acids bind to the negatively charged DNA.

homeobox (HOX genes)
A short stretch of similar or
identical 180-base-pair (nucleotide) sequences of DNA
within a homeotic gene in most eukaryotic organisms
that plays a major role in controlling body develop-
ment by regulating patterns of differentiation. Homeot-
ic genes create segments in an embryo that become
specific organs or tissues. Homeoboxes determine posi-
tional cell differentiation and development. Mutations
in these genes will cause one body part to convert into
a totally different one.

homologous structures
Characteristics or parts in
different animals that may have served the same gener-
al function and are shared with related species and

Hooke, Robert 
(1635–1703) English Physicist,
Astronomer
Considered one of the greatest scientists of
the 17th century, and second only to Sir Isaac Newton,
Robert Hooke was born in Freshwater, Isle of Wight, on
July 18, 1635, the son of John Hooke, a clergyman.
He entered Westminster School in 1648 at the age
of 13, and then attended Christ College, Oxford, in
1653, where many of the best English scientists were
congregating, such as Robert Boyle, Christopher Wren
(astronomer), John Wilkins (founder of the Royal Soci-
ety), and William Petty (cartographer). He never
received a bachelor’s degree, was nominated for the
M.A. in 1663 by Lord Clarendon, the chancellor of the
university, and given an M.D. at Doctors’ Commons in
1691, also by patronage.
Hooke’s first publication of his own work in 1661
was a small pamphlet on capillary action. Shortly after,
in 1662, he was appointed the first curator of experi-
ments at the newly founded Royal Society of London.
The society, also known as The Royal Society of Lon-
don for Improving Natural Knowledge, was founded
on November 28, 1660, to discuss the latest develop-
ments in science, philosophy, and the arts. The found-
ing fathers, consisting of 12 men, began after a lecture
by Christopher Wren at Gresham College. The group
included Wren, Boyle, John Wilkins, Sir Robert Moray,
and William Brouncker. This position gave Hooke a
unique opportunity to familiarize himself with the lat-
est progress in science.
Part of Hooke’s job was to demonstrate and lecture
on several experiments at the Royal Society at each
weekly meeting. This led him to many observations
and inventions in a number of fields, including astrono-
my, physics, and meteorology. He excelled at this job,
and in 1663 Hooke was elected a fellow of the society,
becoming not just an employee but on equal footing
with the other members.
Hooke took advantage of his experience and posi-
tion. He invented the first reflecting telescope, the spi-
ral spring in watches, an iris diaphragm for telescopes
(now used in cameras instead), the universal joint, the
first screw-divided quadrant, a compound microscope,
an odometer, a wheel-cutting machine, a hearing aid, a
new type of glass, and carriage improvements. Despite
all of these accomplishments, he remains one of the
most neglected scientists, due to his argumentative style
and the apparent retribution by his enemies such as
Newton.
Hooke became a professor of physics at Gresham
College in 1665 and stayed there for his entire life. It
was also where the Royal Society met until after his
death. Hooke also served as the society’s secretary from
1677 to 1683.
The year 1665 is another milestone year for
Hooke, since that is when he published his major work
Micrographia, the first treatment on microscopy, and
where he demonstrated his remarkable powers of
observation and his skillful microscopic investigation in
the fields of botany, chemistry, and meteorology. With-
in this work, he made many acute observations, illus-
trated with intricate drawings, and proposed several
theories.
Hooke was the first to discover plant cells and he
coined the word cell, which he attributed to the porous
structure of cork, although he failed to realize that cells
were the basic units of life. He made detailed observa-
tions, some of the first, on insects, sponges, bryozoans,
foraminifera, and even birds. He was the first to exam-
ine fossils under a microscope and concluded that
many fossils represented organisms that no longer
existed on Earth.
Because of his controversies—he had competing
claims with Christian Huyghens over the invention of
the spring regulator and with Newton, first over optics
(1672) and, second, over the formulation of the inverse
square law of gravitation (1686)—Hooke fell out of
favor in the scientific community. He died in London on
March 3, 1703, and was buried in Bishopsgate. How-
ever, sometime in the 19th century his bones were
removed, and no one knows where he is buried today.
hookworms
Tiny parasitic nematode worms belong-
ing to the family Ancylostomatidae. They attach them-
selves to the intestinal walls of humans with hooked
mouthparts. Hookworms (Necator and Ancylostoma
spp.) are responsible for ancylostomiasis.

Hopkins, Frederick Gowland (1861–1947) English
Biochemist
Frederick Gowland Hopkins was born on
June 20, 1861, in Eastbourne, England, to a bookseller
in Bishopsgate Street, London, who died when Freder-
ick was an infant.
In 1871 he attended the City of London School,
and at the early age of 17, he published a paper in The
Entomologist on the bombardier beetle. He went to
University College, London, where he became the assis-
tant to Sir Thomas Stevenson, an expert on poisoning.
In 1888 he became a medical student at Guy’s Hospi-
tal, London.
In 1894 he graduated in medicine and taught phys-
iology and toxicology at Guy’s Hospital for four years,
and in 1898 he moved to Cambridge. He was appoint-
ed fellow and tutor at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.
Hopkins established biochemistry as a field in
Great Britain. He discovered how to isolate the amino
acid tryptophan and identified its structure, discovered
enzymes, and isolated glutathione. For his research on
discovering growth-stimulating vitamin, which he
called “accessory substances,” he was awarded the
Nobel Prize in 1929 in medicine or physiology. He
actually isolated vitamins C, A, and D.
Hopkins was knighted in 1925 and received the
Order of Merit in 1935. Hopkins died in 1947 at the
age of 86. The Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins Memo-
rial Lecture of the Biochemical Society, named in his
honor, is presented by a lecturer to assess the impact of
recent advances in his or her particular field on devel-
opments in biochemistry. The award is made every two
to three years and the lecturer is presented with a
medal and £1,000.
hormone
A substance produced by endocrine glands,
released in very low concentration into the blood-
stream, and which exerts regulatory effects on specific
organs or tissues distant from the site of secretion.

Houssay, Bernardo Alberto (1887–1971) Argentine
Physiologist
Bernardo Alberto Houssay was born in
Buenos Aires, Argentina, on April 10, 1887, to Dr.
Albert and Clara Houssay (née Laffont), who had
come to Argentina from France. His father was a bar-
rister. Houssay’s early education was at a private
school, the Colegio Británico. He then entered the
School of Pharmacy of the University of Buenos Aires
at the age of 14, graduating in 1904. He had already
begun studying medicine and, in 1907, before complet-
ing his studies, took up a post in the department of
physiology and began research that resulted in his
receiving an M.D. in 1911.
In 1910 he was appointed professor of physiology
in the university’s school of veterinary medicine. In
1919 he became professor of physiology in the medical
school at Buenos Aires University and also organized
the Institute of Physiology at the medical school, mak-
ing it a center with an international reputation. He
remained professor and director of the institute until
1943, when the government then in power deprived
him of his post, the result of his voicing the opinion
that there should be effective democracy in the coun-
try. In 1955 a new government reinstated him in the
university.
He demonstrated that a hormone secreted by the
pituitary prevented metabolism of sugar and that injec-
tions of pituitary extract induced symptoms of dia-
betes. He was awarded the 1947 Nobel Prize in
physiology or medicine for this work on the functions
of the pituitary gland.
In 1949 he came to the United States as a special
research fellow at the National Institutes of Health.
During his lifetime, Houssay authored more than 500
papers and several books and won many scientific
prizes and awards. He died on September 21, 1971.
Human Genome Project
The Human Genome Pro-
ject (HGP) is an international research effort to deter-
mine the DNA sequence of the entire human genome.
Contributors to the HGP include the National Insti-
tutes of Health (NIH); the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE); numerous universities throughout the United
States; and international partners in the United King-
dom, France, Germany, Japan, and China.
Begun in 1990, the U.S. Human Genome Project is
a long-term effort coordinated by the Department of
Energy and the National Institutes of Health. The goals
of the project are to identify all of the approximately
30,000 genes in human DNA; determine the sequences
of the 3 billion chemical base pairs that make up human
DNA; store this information in databases; improve
tools for data analysis; transfer related technologies to

humoral immunity
A form of immune reaction that
attacks bacteria and viruses found in body fluids using
antibodies synthesized by the B lymphocytes that circu-
late in blood plasma and lymph. These fluids were once
called “humors.”
Huxley, T. H. A 19th-century evolutionist who dis-
covered the unbroken horse lineage from the Eocene to
the Holocene (recent) epochs, perhaps the longest and
most complete evolutionary sequence in the fossil
record.
hyaline
A clear or transparent structure such as a
wing of a dragonfly (e.g., Aeshna canadensis and Sym-
petrum vicinum), or an amorphous texture due to
accumulation of intra- or extracellular material.
hybrid
The offspring produced by genetically distinct
different parents. Mating can be within species
(intraspecific) as well as between species (interspecific).
hybridization
Producing hybrids from interbreeding
two species. In genetics, it is the annealing of two com-
plementary strands of DNA, or an RNA strand to a
complementary DNA strand.
hybridoma
The fusion of two different cells to cre-
ate a hybrid cell that secretes a single specific antibody,
e.g., the fusion of a spleen cell and a cancer cell, or a T
lymphocyte with a lymphoma cell.
hybrid vigor
Increased vitality or success of a hybrid
over its inbred parents.
hybrid zone
A geographical territory where previ-
ously isolated or genetically distinct populations make
contact and form hybrids. Where two geographical
races of a single species overlap, hybrids and intermedi-
ates can outnumber the pure forms in the overlap
region. What determines whether there will be two
species or one is the balance between gene flow and
selection against hybrids.
hydration
Addition of water or the elements of
water (i.e., H and OH) to a molecular entity. The term
is also used in a more restricted sense for the process: A
(gas)   A (aqueous solution).
See also AQUATION and SOLVATION.

hydrogen.
hydrocephalus
A
condition in which the head
becomes enlarged and expanded beyond normal size
due to congenital or other causes.
hydrogenase
An ENZYME, dihydrogen acceptor OXI-
DOREDUCTASE, that catalyzes the formation or oxida-
tion of H2. Hydrogenases are of various types. One
class ([Fe]-hydrogenases) contains only IRON–SULFUR
CLUSTERs. The other major class ([NiFe]-hydrogenases)
has a nickel-containing center and iron–sulfur clusters;
a variation of the latter type ([NiFeSe]-hydrogenases)
contains selenocysteine.
hydrogen bond
A form of association between an
electronegative atom and a hydrogen atom attached to
a second, relatively electronegative atom. It is best
considered as an electrostatic interaction, heightened
by the small size of hydrogen, that permits proximity
of the interacting dipoles or charges. Both electronega-
tive atoms are usually (but not necessarily) from the
first row of the periodic table, e.g., N, O, or F. Hydro-
gen bonds can be intermolecular or intramolecular.
With a few exceptions, usually involving fluorine, the
associated energies are less than 20–25 kJ mol–1 (5–6
kcal mol–1).
A type of bond formed when the partially positive
hydrogen atom of a polar covalent bond in one
168

General name for the ion H+, either in natu-
ral abundance or where it is not desired to distinguish
between the isotopes, such as proton for 1H+, deuteron
for 2H+, and triton for 3H+.
hydrophilic
“Water loving.” The capacity of a
molecular entity or of a substituent to interact with
polar solvents, in particular with water, or with other
polar groups. Hydrophilic molecules dissolve easily in
water, but not in fats or oils.
hydrophilicity
The tendency of a molecule to be sol-
vated by water.
hydrophobic
A molecule or substance that does not
associate, bond, or dissolve in water. Hydrophobic
molecules dissolve easily in fats and oils.
hydrophobic interaction
The tendency of hydrocar-
bons (or of lipophilic hydrocarbonlike groups in
solutes) to form intermolecular aggregates in an aque-
ous medium as well as analogous intramolecular inter-
actions. The name arises from the attribution of the
phenomenon to the apparent repulsion between water
and hydrocarbons. Use of the misleading alternative
term hydrophobic bond is discouraged.
hydrophobicity
The association of nonpolar groups
or molecules in an aqueous environment that arises
from the tendency of water to exclude nonpolar
molecules.
See also LIPOPHILICITY.
hydrostatic skeleton
A skeletal system created by
the pressure caused by fluid-filled closed areas that sup-
port rigidity in an organism or one of its parts. Many
invertebrates have hydrostatic skeletons. Earthworms
are an example.
hydroxyl group
A functional group that has a
hydrogen atom joined to an oxygen atom by a polar
covalent bond (–OH). When put in solution with
water, they form alcohols.

Science and the Spiritual Factor
By John McConnell
For the most part, the scientific community has avoided
questions that cannot be measured, analyzed, and evalu-
ated using their present tools and procedures. An example
of this is the scientist who stated that she would consider
the possible existence of a soul—as soon as they deter-
mined the part of the brain that provided communication
with the soul.
Most people believe that they have a soul and con-
sider the issues of life after death, the existence and
nature of God, and the meaning of life. Religious beliefs
and values enable them to relate to the unknown with ben-
efit to their personal values, conduct, and happiness.
However, most scientists by their indifference and skepti-
cism have tended to undermine the value of faith and treat
it as superstition.
In these matters, hypotheses that cannot be proved or
disproved should be judged, or at least acknowledged of
value, by the results in the lives of individuals who practice
their faith.
The one belief that science has mathematically proved
is the existence and benefit of love. (See Von Foerster,
Heinz. Logical Structure of Environment and Its Internal
Representation. Zeeland, Mich.: Herman Miller Inc., 1963.)
Love can thus provide the test of hypotheses about phe-
nomena of mind and spirit that presently defy explanation.
So now ultimate questions about reality, which remain pro-
found mysteries that cannot be approached by scientific
measurements or methods, can nevertheless be recognized
and pursued through articles of faith and practice. If reality
is consistent, then the truth and the value of a faith or belief
can be judged by the increase and depth of love—or cre-
ative altruism—in the lives of those who practice at belief.
Prayer to a personal God and practice of the Sermon
on the Mount has inspired personal love and courage and
led to great peaceful changes for social freedom and jus-
tice. (See This Freedom Whence by John Wesley Brady,
and Communism and Christ by Charles Loury.)
Science must no longer negate the values of religious
belief, but rather strengthen and support the importance of
faith—of using the personal metaphor that increases the
well-being of the individual, that deepens relationships with
people and kinship with life on Earth.
The scientific approach can at the same time dimin-
ish religious intolerance by calling attention to the nature
of metaphor or hypothesis. A hypothesis can be exciting
and useful and obtain confidence from its supporters who
may totally believe in its validity. Nevertheless, by its
nature there must be, and can be, recognition and respect
for people with a different hypothesis about reality. Where
approval for a different religious or philosophical doctrine
may be impossible, there still can be deep approval of the
love that is motivated and demonstrated in connection
with it.
The scientific community should also give importance
to any phenomenon that greatly affects human values and
potentials, even though scientific explanation eludes its
grasp. There is overwhelming evidence of answered prayer
in the lives of many people. The incidence of favorable coin-
cidence in deeply dedicated people who pray with fervor
and faith should be studied and compared with other people
who practice a purely psychological approach to needs.
The nature and extent of coincidences that run contrary to
probability theory should be more thoroughly explored. Per-
haps there is no satisfactory explanation possible. But this
should not cause science to ignore the phenomenon or its
causes and effects in the lives of people.
Of course, scientists would make a careful distinction
between a phenomenon and its effects, on the other hand,
explaining what it is and how it works. Great benefit could
come from more attention to phenomenology and the many
instances of its effects on the lives of people.
The nature and extent of spiritual healing should be more
critically examined. While success seems a random effect
that is rare, many proven cases defy medical explanation.
By its very nature, any effort to make Earth a healthy,
peaceful planet must be achieved through a great spiritual
awakening of a kind that will foster the nurture and care of
Earth and a creative happy life for all its people.

imprinting
A type of behavior learned during a cer-
tain critical time in development that promotes the
learning of behavior and characteristics of the species
and is difficult to reverse, regardless of circumstances.
An example is the attachment behavior among birds to
the mother during the first few hours after hatching. In
genetics, it is when an allele at a particular locus is
inactivated or altered depending on whether it was
inherited by the mother or father.
inbreeding
The production of offspring by closely
related parents with a high likelihood of carrying simi-
lar deleterious recessive mutations that may be
expressed in the phenotypes of the offspring. The
resulting populations may suffer a higher than average
incidence of recessive genetic disorders.
incest
When two people too closely related have
intercourse, i.e., a parent and child, or two first
cousins. Usually socially prohibited.
incomplete dominance
A type of inheritance where
the heterozygote that has two different alleles (one
dominant, one recessive) of a gene pair has a different
appearance (phenotype) compared with the homozy-
gous (identical alleles for a given gene) parents.
incomplete flower
A flower lacking one of the four
major parts: SEPALs, petals, STAMENs, or CARPELs.
incomplete metamorphosis
Part of a life cycle of
an insect where the nymph stage, or immature form,
resembles the adult after hatching and slowly changes
into the adult form through a series of molts; does not
have a pupa stage. Examples are grasshoppers (Oth-
optera), aphids, cicadas, and whiteflies. A form of
incomplete metamorphosis called gradual metamor-
phosis is when there is no pupal stage and the nymphs
look like the adults minus the wings. Unlike complete
metamorphosis, which has four stages (EGG, LARVA,
PUPA, and adult), incomplete metamorphosis only has
three (no pupa).
See also METAMORPHOSIS.
IND
Investigational new drug.

dueterostomes (e.g., chordates and echinoderms) where
each cell produced during early cleavage division has
the ability to develop into a complete embryo.
indeterminate egg layer

to lay more eggs by removing or destroying eggs they
have already laid. Also called double clutching.
indeterminate growth
When an organism continues
to grow throughout its life span (ontogeny); character-
istic of plants.
indeterminate inflorescence
When the central part
of the flower is the last to open. Terminal flowers open
last and lower flowers open first.
index fossils
A biologic method of time correlation
using commonly found fossils that are limited to a spe-
cific time span. For example, trilobites, though com-
mon in the Paleozoic, are not found before the
Cambrian period. Some lineages of fossil organisms
evolved rapidly, so that the vertical stratigraphic range
of the species was short
but the species was
widespread. A dating technique to correlate the ages of
rocks in difference locations (biostratigraphy).
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
indigenous

imprinting

industrial melanism
A natural selection process that
developed in the 19th century, when certain species
such as moths developed a coloration adaptation to
compete with industrial soot pollution (e.g., the black-
ening of tree bark). England’s peppered moth (Biston
betularia) is the often-used example.
inert
STABLE and unreactive under specified condi-
tions.
See also LABILE.
infanticide
The purposeful killing of an infant or
baby after birth or shortly after.

The ability to transmit a disease; an infec-
tious disease caused by some microbe or agent that is
infectious.
inferior ovary (epigynous ovary)
Having the calyx,
corolla, and androecium appear to rise from the very
top of the ovary.
inflammatory response
The reaction the body takes
to invading microorganisms. The response includes: an
increase in the blood flow to the infected area to
increase the number of leukocytes that can fight the
invader; the complementary thinning of the local blood
capillary cell walls to allow the increased number of
leukocytes to enter along with the leukocytes releasing
cytokines, immune-signaling chemicals, to call more
leukocytes to the area; and increase in temperature at
the infected site.
inflorescence
Refers to the various positional and
structural arrangements of a flower cluster on a floral
axis. The two main categories are racemose (indefinite
and not terminating in a flower) and cymose (definite,

Types of racemose inflorescence.
Types of cyrose inflorescence.

floral arrangements can be in the form of a panicle
[slightly elongated with central axis with branches that
branch themselves]. Examples of racemose inflores-
cence are: raceme (elongated with central axis com-
posed of simple pedicels of about equal length); spike
(elongated with central axis with sessile/subsessile flow-
ers); corymb (flat topped with vertical axis with
pedicels or branches of unequal length); or umbel (sev-
eral branches from a common point of the peduncle).
ingestion
The process of obtaining nutrients by het-
erotrophic organisms by eating other organisms or
other organic matter.
inhibition
The decrease in the rate of a reaction
brought about by the addition of a substance
(INHIBITOR).
inhibitor
A substance that decreases the rate of
ENZYME catalysis or other chemical reaction.
inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP)
A small
electrical charge of a few millivolts, creating a local
hyperpolarization (increase in membrane potential on
the negativity of the inside of the neuron) in the mem-
brane of a postsynaptic neuron. Caused when an
inhibitory neurotransmitter from a presynaptic cell
binds to a postsynaptic receptor, which makes it diffi-
cult for a postsynaptic neuron to generate an action
potential.
innate behavior
Behavior that is performed without
prior learning; considered hardwired in the nervous sys-
tem. Usually a behavior that is inflexible and built in.
inner cell mass
After a sperm fertilizes an egg, the
resulting single cell that is produced is referred to as
totipotent, meaning that it has the potential to form an
entire organism. Cell division begins immediately, and
after a few days the cells begin to specialize, forming a
blastocyst, a hollow sphere of cells. The blastocyst has
an outer layer of cells, and inside the sphere is the inner
cell mass, a cluster of cells that protrude into one end
of the cavity and will develop into virtually all of the
human tissues.
inositol 1,4,5 triphosphate (IP3)
Acts as a second
messenger; increases intracellular calcium and activates
calcineurin, an intermediate in the T cell activation
pathway; binds to and activates a calcium channel in
the endoplasmic reticulum. A second messenger func-
tions as an intermediate between certain nonsteroid
hormones and the third messenger, resulting in a rise in
cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration.
inquiline
Any organism that lives in the home of
another and shares its food or home (e.g., scarab bee-
tle, which lives in ant nests).
Insecta
The class of animals that contain more than
1 million named species and perhaps millions more
that are not scientifically named as of yet. Found in
almost every habitat worldwide, they are found in
every shape and form, small and large. They all share a
body composed of a head, thorax, and abdomen; a pair
of relatively large compound eyes; usually three ocelli
(simple eyes) and pair of antennae located on the head;
mouthparts consisting of a labrum, a pair of mandibles
and maxillae, a labium, and a tonguelike hypopharynx;
two pairs of wings, derived from outgrowths of the
body wall, and three pairs of walking legs.
insectivorous
Refers to an animal or plant that eats
insects.
See also CARNIVORE.
insertion
A mutation that occurs when one or more
nucleotide pairs are added to a gene, causing a frame
shift, which is a change in how the information in a gene
is translated by the cell. Two other mutations include a
deletion mutation, where one or more bases are removed
from the DNA sequence of a gene, and substitution
mutation, where one base is replaced by another at a 
single position in the DNA sequence of a gene.

mation of the general type X–Z + Y   X–Y–Z in
which the connecting atom or group Y replaces the
bond joining the parts X and Z of the reactant XZ.
insertion sequence
A short stretch of mobile bacte-
rial DNA known as a transposon that has the capacity
to move between different points within a genome, or
change positions; special sequences at their terminal
ends allow them to integrate into strands of DNA; usu-
ally are inverted repeats (two copies of the same or
related sequence of DNA repeated in opposite orienta-
tion on the same molecule) at the ends of the insertion
sequence; can alter gene expression; involved in trans-
position.

insulin
A protein hormone produced in the pan-
creas by beta cells, located in the islets of Langerhans,
that stimulates cellular utilization of glucose by body
cells, by converting glucose and other carbohydrates
to energy, and helps control blood-sugar levels by act-
ing antagonistically with glucagons, the chief source
of stored fuel, in the liver. It is released by various sig-
nals that are sensitive to the intake and digestion of
food. It also acts as an important regulator of protein
and lipid metabolism. Insulin is used as a drug to con-
trol insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a disorder
that is caused by the insufficient production of
insulin. Without insulin, cells do not absorb glucose.
Diabetic individuals can have type I diabetes (juvenile)
comprising about 10 percent of the population, or
type II diabetes (adult). Presently some 16 million
Americans have diabetes, with 1,700 new cases being
diagnosed daily. Diabetes has been linked to the devel-
opment of a variety of diseases including heart dis-
ease, 
stroke, 
peripheral 
vascular 
disease, 
and
neurological disorders.
integral protein
A protein of biological membranes
that penetrates into or spans the lipid bilayer of a cell
membrane. The lipid bilayer is a protective membrane
that surrounds the cell and consists of two layers of

or species; hybridize.
intercalation 
compounds
Compounds 
resulting
from inclusion, usually without covalent bonding, of
one kind of molecule (the guest molecule) in a matrix
of another compound (the host compound), which has
a layered structure. The host compound, with a rather
rigid structure, may be macromolecular, crystalline, or
amorphous.
interferon
A chemical messenger of the immune sys-
tem, composed of a group of cytokine proteins that
have antiviral characteristics that are capable of help-
ing the immune response. Three main types of interfer-
on—alpha, beta, and gamma—are produced by
virus-infected cells and are released to coat uninfected
cells, thus preventing them from becoming infected.
Alpha interferon is produced by virus-infected mono-
cytes and lymphocytes, while beta is produced by virus-
infected fibroblasts. Gamma is produced by stimulated
T and NK cells.
interleukin
A group of natural chemical glycopro-
tein messengers, acting as cytokines, that are secreted
by different cells of the immune system to make other
cells perform specific cellular functions. Interleukin-1
(IL-1) is released early by monocytes, macrophages, T
cells, and other immune cells to fight infection. It
stimulates T cell proliferation and protein synthesis
and causes fever. Can be cleaved into a peptide
involved in cell death (apoptosis). Interleukin-2 (IL-2)
is produced by T helper and suppresser lymphocytes.
IL-2 increases the expression of natural killer and
other cytotoxic cells and stimulates helper T cells to
proliferate more rapidly. IL-2 is produced commercial-
ly by recombinant DNA technology and used for the
treatment of metastatic renal (i.e., kidney) cell cancer.
Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is released by lymphocytes (TH-2
subset of T helper lymphocytes) and promotes anti-
body production by stimulating B cells to proliferate
and mature and promotes allergic responses via pro-
duction of the immunoglobulin IgE. Interleukin-6 (IL-
6) affects many different cells in the immune system
by inducing differentiation and activation. Inter-
leukin-10 (IL-10), like IL-4, is released by lympho-
cytes (the TH-2 subset of T helper lymphocytes).
IL-10 enhances the humoral response and increases
antibody production. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) induces
the production of natural killer and other cytotoxic
immune cells.
intermediate filament
A fibrous protein filament of
the cytoskeleton that helps form ropelike bundles in
animal cells and is about 10 nm in size, falling in the
middle between the size of microtubules and microfila-
ments; provides tensile strength.

interneuron
One of the three types of neuron net-
works (along with sensory and motor neurons) that
allow information flow by way of impulses and action
potentials to travel through the nervous system. Found
in the central nervous system, they provide the center
of a loop that receives upstream input from thousands
of motor neurons, then sends the signals to the brain,
processes the returns, and then transmits the down-
stream output to a similar number of sensory neurons
for action.
internode
The segment on a plant stem between the
points where leaves are attached; the region or length
of stem between two nodes.
interphase
One of the phases of cell division during
the process of mitosis. Interphase is the stage between
two successive cell divisions and the time when DNA is
replicated in the nucleus, followed by mitosis. Inter-
phase itself has several phases: the first gap phase (G1)
is the time prior to DNA synthesis where the cell
increases in mass; the synthesis or S phase is the time
DNA is actually synthesized; and gap or G2 is the
phase after DNA syntheses and cell protein synthesis
and before the start of prophase.
See also MITOSIS.
interstitial
Refers to the space between cells, air-
ways, blood vessels, alveoli, atoms, molecules, and
even soil particles.
interstitial cells
Cells that exist in the connective tis-
sues between other tissues and structures; cells among
the seminiferous tubules, tiny tubes of the testis where
sperm cells are produced and that secrete the male sex
hormones testosterone and other androgens.
interstitial fluid (intercellular fluid)
Fluid that fills
spaces between cells and provides pathways for the
flow of nutrients, gases, and wastes between capillaries
and cells.
intertidal zone
One of the oceanic zones where the
ocean meets land; landform can be submerged or
exposed; shallow shore area between low and high tide
or water marks.
See also ABYSSAL ZONE; BENTHIC ZONE; PELAGIC
ZONE.
intra-
A prefix meaning within or inside.
intrinsic activity
The maximal stimulatory response
induced by a compound in relation to that of a given
reference compound.
This term has evolved with common usage. It was
introduced by E. J. Ariëns as a proportionality factor
between tissue response and RECEPTOR occupancy. The
numerical value of intrinsic activity (alpha) could range
from unity (for full AGONISTs, i.e., agonist inducing the
tissue maximal response) to zero (for ANTAGONISTs),
intrinsic activity

internode
node
The internode is the segment on a plant stem between the points
leaves are attached. It is the region or length of stem between
two nodes.

the fractional values within this range denoting PARTIAL
AGONISTs. Ariëns’s original definition equates the
molecular nature of alpha to maximal response only
when response is a linear function of receptor occupan-
cy. This function has been verified. Thus, intrinsic
activity, which is a DRUG and tissue parameter, cannot
be used as a characteristic drug parameter for classifi-
cation of drugs or drug receptors. For this purpose, a
proportionality factor derived by null methods, namely,
relative EFFICACY, should be used. Finally, “intrinsic
activity” should not be used instead of “intrinsic effica-
cy.” A “partial agonist” should be termed “agonist
with intermediate intrinsic efficacy” in a given tissue.
intrinsic rate of increase (rmax)  A mathematical
parameter that measures the maximum rate at which a
population will grow if resources are unlimited, using
birth and death rates in a population as the determi-
nants. It is the difference between the number of births
and the number of deaths; the maximum population
growth rate.
introgression
The movement of genes from one pop-
ulation into another through hybridization followed by
backcrossing.
intron
An intervening section of DNA that occurs
almost exclusively within a eukaryotic GENE, but which
is not translated to amino acid SEQUENCEs in the gene
product. The introns are removed from the premature
mRNA through a process called splicing, which leaves
the EXONs untouched, to form an active mRNA.
See also EUKARYOTE; MESSENGER RNA; TRANSLATION.

inversion
A chromosomal aberration or mutation,
occurring during meiosis or from mutagens, that involves
detaching a chromosome segment, rotating it 180
degrees, and then reinserting it in its original location.
invertebrates
Animals that do not have a backbone
or notochord. They are cold-blooded and have solid,
external skeletons or hydrostatic skeletons. They include
small protozoans, sponges, corals, tapeworms, spiders,
mollusks, and others. Most animals on the planet (95
percent of all animal species) are invertebrates, and the
majority of those, excepting insects, are aquatic.
in vitro fertilization
Fertilization outside the body,
whereby a male sperm and female egg are combined in
a laboratory. The embryo is then artificially transferred
into a female’s uterus.
ion
An atom that acquires a charge by either gaining
or losing an electron.
ion channel
Enables ions to flow rapidly through
membranes in a thermodynamically downhill direc-
tion after an electrical or chemical impulse. Their
structures usually consist of four to six membrane-
spanning DOMAINs. This number determines the 
size of the pore and thus the size of the ion to be
transported.
See also ION PUMP.
ionic bond
A chemical bond or link between two
atoms due to an attraction between oppositely charged
(positive-negative) ions.
ionophore
A compound that can carry specific ions
through membranes of cells or organelles.
ion pump
Enables ions to flow through membranes
in a thermodynamically uphill direction by the use of
an energy source such as ATP or light. They consist of
sugar-containing heteropeptide assemblies that open
and close upon the binding and subsequent HYDROLYSIS
of ATP, usually transporting more than one ion toward
the outside or the inside of the membrane.
See also ADENOSINE TRIPHOSPHATE; ION CHANNEL.
iron-responsive element
A specific base SEQUENCE
in certain MESSENGER RNAs that code for various pro-
teins of iron METABOLISM, which allows REGULATION at
TRANSLATIONal level by the IRON-RESPONSIVE PROTEIN.
iron-responsive protein (IRP)
A protein that responds
to the level of iron in the cell and regulates the biosyn-
thesis of proteins of iron METABOLISM by binding to the
IRON-RESPONSIVE ELEMENT on MESSENGER RNA.
See also REGULATION.
iron-sulfur cluster
A unit comprising two or more
iron atoms and bridging sulfide LIGANDs in an IRON-
SULFUR PROTEIN. The recommended designation of a
CLUSTER consists of the iron and sulfide content, in
square brackets, e.g., [2FE–2S], [4FE–4S]. The possible
oxidation levels are indicated by the net charge exclud-
ing the ligands, for example a [4Fe–4S]2+ or [4Fe–4S]1+
or [4Fe–4S]2+; 1+ cluster.
See also BRIDGING LIGAND.
iron-sulfur proteins
Proteins in which nonheme iron
is coordinated with cysteine sulfur and usually also with
inorganic sulfur. Divided into three major categories:
RUBREDOXINs; simple iron-sulfur proteins, containing
only IRON-SULFUR CLUSTERs; and complex iron-sulfur
proteins, containing additional active redox centers such
as FLAVIN, molybdenum, or HEME. In most iron-sulfur
proteins the clusters function as electron transfer groups,
but in others they have other functions such as catalysis
of hydratase/dehydratase reactions, maintenance of pro-
tein structure, or REGULATION of activity.
See also COORDINATION.
IRP
See IRON-RESPONSIVE PROTEIN.
IRP

alyzes the isomerization of a SUBSTRATE.
See also EC NOMENCLATURE FOR ENZYMES.
isomers
Compounds that have the same number and
type of atoms (same molecular formula) but differ in
the way they are combined with each other. They can
differ by the bonding sequence, called structural or
constitutional isomerism, or the way their atoms are
arranged spatially, called stereoisomerism. Other types
include conformational, configurational, geometric,
optical, enantiomers, and diastereomers.
isomorphic alternation of generations
When
gametophyte and sporophyte generations are morpho-
logically alike, but differ in the number of chromo-
somes.
Isoptera
Termites, a social order of insects that are
soft bodied and comprise about 2,300 species world-
wide. They obtain their nutrition from eating wood
and digesting cellulose with the help of bacteria and
protozoans found in their intestinal area.
isosteres
Molecules or ions of similar size containing
the same number of atoms and valence electrons, e.g.,
O2–, F–, Ne.
See also BIOISOSTERE.
isotonic solutions
Solutions having identical osmot-
ic pressures, i.e., a solution where cells do not swell or
shrink.
isotope
A different form of a single element that has
the same number of protons, but has a different num-
ber of neutrons in its nucleus. Radioactive isotopes are
unstable and break down until they become stable.
Carbon 14 is a radioactive isotope of carbon that is
used to date fossilized organic matter.
isotropy
Lack of 
ANISOTROPY;
the property of
molecules and materials of having identical physical
properties in all directions.

joint
The contact area between two bones. There are
many different types of joint, including hinge, ball and
socket, universal, sliding, and slightly movable.
Joly, John An Irish geologist (1857–1933) who, in
1899, tried to determine the Earth’s age by calculat-
ing how long it would take for the rivers to dump
salt into the ocean to reach the present salinity lev-
els. It was based on the assumption that oceans were
freshwater when first formed. He estimated 90 mil-
lion years for the age of the Earth. He was more
accurate with dating a geological time period. Work-
ing with Sir Ernest Rutherford in Cambridge in
1913, and using the radioactive decay in minerals, he
estimated that the beginning of the Devonian peri-
od—the time between the Silurian and Carbonifer-
ous—was not less than 400 million years ago, an age
that is pretty well accepted today. Joly collaborated
with Henry Horatio Dixon and was the first to
explain how sap rises in plants largely due to evapo-
ration from leaves.
joule (J)
A unit of work and energy; 1 J = 0.239 cal;
1 cal = 4.184 J. It is defined as being equal to the work
done when the point of application of a force of 1 new-
ton (N) moves in the direction of the force, a distance
of 1 meter (m).
junk DNA (noncoding DNA)
Genomic DNA that
serves no apparent purpose; stretches of DNA that do
not code for genes.
Jurassic period
The middle period of the Mesozoic
era, 213 to 145 million years ago. Age of the
dinosaurs. Named after the Jura Mountains between
France and Switzerland, where rocks of this age were
first studied.
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
juvenile
A stage in development prior to adult stage.
juvenile hormone
A chemical hormone in insects
secreted by a pair of endocrine glands, corpora allata,
close to the brain. It inhibits metamorphosis and main-
tains larva or nymph characteristics during develop-
ment and is responsible for determining the molt type.
One of three major insect development hormones. Used
as a pesticide, it retards the development of insects.
juxtaglomerular apparatus
A group of specialized
cells or tissue in a kidney nephron that is located near the
point where the afferent arteriole meets the distal tubule.
It is composed of the macula densa, a specialized group
183
J

of cells in the distal tubule, and the juxtaglomerular
cells, epithelioid cells in the media of the afferent 
arterioles just as they enter the glomerulus. The juxta-
glomerular apparatus supplies blood to the GLOMERU-
LUS, controls the glomerular filtration rate (volume of
plasma filtered through the glomerulus per second),
blood pressure, and circulating volume through the
release of rennin, which activates angiotensin, a family
of peptide hormones that control blood pressure and
body fluid levels.

kala-azar (Leishmaniasis)
A disease found in tropical
countries and southern Europe caused by a protozoan
parasite, Leishmania donova, obtained through the bite
of a sand fly. It affects some 1.5 million people each year.
Also known as dumdum fever or visceral leishmaniasis.
kame
A short hill, ridge, or mound of stratified drift
deposited by glacial meltwater.
kappa convention
See DONOR ATOM SYMBOL.
karyogamy
In syngamy, the process of union of two
gametes (fertilization), there are two processes. The
first step, called plasmogamy, is the fusion of cytoplasm
of two cells. The second step is karyogamy, the fusion
of the nuclei of two cells. It is the fusion of two com-
patible haploid nuclei to form one diploid nucleus.
karyotype
A method of classifying the paired chro-
mosomes of a cell in relation to number, size, and mor-
phology. A microscopic picture is taken of an
individual’s chromosome set. The chromosomes are
then stained with special color dyes that produce a dis-
tinct stripe or banding pattern. The chromosomes are
then rearranged according to size from largest to small-
est. Used to see gross chromosomal abnormalities with
the characteristics of specific diseases.
kelp
A group of large brown seaweeds or algae (class
Phaeophyceae) that belong to the order Laminariales.
They have a heteromorphic alternation of generations,
which has two free-living life phases: the first or
macroscopic diploid sporophyte generation and a
microscopic haploid gametophyte generation. Sporo-
phytes are typically differentiated into a holdfast, stipe,
and one or more leaflike blades. They live in cold,
nutrient-rich waters throughout the world in shallow
open coastal waters. They are photosynthetic, which
restricts them to clear shallow water not much deeper
than 15–40 meters.

Kendall, 
Edward 
Calvin (1886–1972) American
Biochemist
Edward Calvin Kendall was born on
March 8, 1886, in South Norwalk, Connecticut. He
was educated at Columbia University and obtained a
B.S. in 1908, M.S. in chemistry in 1909, and a Ph.D. in
chemistry in 1910.
From 1910 until 1911 he was a research chemist
for Parke, Davis and Co., in Detroit, Michigan, and
conducted research on the thyroid gland, continuing
the work from 1911 until 1914 at St. Luke’s Hospital,
New York.
In 1914 he was appointed head of the biochemistry
section in the graduate school of the Mayo Foundation,
Rochester, that is part of the University of Minnesota.
In 1915 he was appointed director of the division of bio-
chemistry and subsequently professor of physiological
185
K

chemistry. In 1951 he retired from the Mayo Founda-
tion and accepted the position of visiting professor in
the department of biochemistry at Princeton University.
In 1914 he isolated thyroxine, the active principle
of the thyroid gland, and also discovered the crystal-
lization and chemical nature of glutathione, and con-
ducted work on the oxidation systems in animals.
Kendall isolated and identified a series of com-
pounds from the adrenal gland cortex, and while work-
ing at Merk & Co., Inc., he prepared cortisone by
partial synthesis. He also investigated the effects of cor-
tisone and of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) on
rheumatoid arthritis with Philip S. HENCH, H. F. Polley,
and C. H. Slocumb. Kendall and Hench, along with
Tadeus REICHSTEIN, shared the Nobel Prize in physiolo-
gy or medicine in 1950 for this work. Kendall received
many awards and honors. He died on May 4, 1972.
keratin
A tough, insoluble, fibrous protein with
high sulfur content that forms the main structure 
and protective barrier or cytoskeleton of epidermal
cells and is the chief constituent of skin, hair, nails,
and enamel of the teeth. It is produced by ker-
atinocytes, the most abundant cells in the epidermis
(95 percent). Keratin makes up 30 percent of the cel-
lular protein of all living epidermal cells. The high
amount of sulfur content is due to the presence of the
amino acid cystine.
keystone predator
A dominant species as predator
that maintains species richness in a community through
selective predation of the best competitors in the com-
munity, and as a result maintains populations of less
competitive species.

The term karyotype refers to the chromosomal complement of an individual, including the number of chromosomes and any abnormalities.
The term is also used to refer to a photograph of an individual’s chromosomes. (Courtesy Darryl Leja, NHGRI, National Institutes of Health)

The ocher star (Pisaster orchraceous) is a keystone
predator because it prevents mussels, its prey, from tak-
ing over intertidal areas. Sea otters are a keystone
predator in kelp beds, since they eat the urchins that
feed on kelp, whose beds maintain a diversity of other
organisms.
The removal of a keystone predator from an
ecosystem causes a reduction of the species diversity
among its former prey.
Keystone species increase or decrease the diversity
of a system because they play a dominant role and
affect many other organisms, including the death and
disappearance of the dependent species.
kidney
An organ, paired, in vertebrates that regu-
lates secretion and osmoregulation as part of the uri-
nary system. Filtration takes place at the site of the
glomerulus in the Bowman’s capsule, while the loops
of Henle are responsible for taking waste material to
be excreted. Millions of nephrons within the renal
cortex and renal medulla filter the blood and regulate
the volume and composition of body fluids during 
the formation of urine. A ureter from each kidney
carries urine produced in the kidney to the bladder
for elimination.
kilocalorie (kcal)
One kilocalorie is equal to 1,000
calories, a unit of heat equal to the amount of heat
required to raise the temperature of 1 kilogram of
water by 1 degree at one atmosphere pressure; used to
measure the energy value in food and labor; usually
just called calorie: 1 kilocalorie (kcal) = 1 Calorie
(Cal) = 1,000 calories (cal). However, in the Interna-
tional System of Units (ISU), the universal unit of
energy is the joule (J). One kilocalorie = 4.184 kilo-
joules (kJ).
kilogram
The basic unit of mass (not of weight or of
force). A kilogram is equal to the mass of 1.000028
cubic decimeters of water at the temperature of its
maximum density.
kinematics
A division of mechanics that studies
objects in motion (like an animal’s gait) and their
changes in position and the effects of motion on dis-
tance and time of travel. Differs from the study of
mechanics, which also includes the effects of mass and
force.
kinesis
When an animal finds itself in an unwanted
environment, kinesis is its ability to respond to the
intensity of this stimulus by undirected movement in a
random way (trial and error).
kinetic energy
Energy of motion; kinetic energy
depends on the object’s mass and velocity and can 
be described mathematically as K.E. = 1/2mv2.
Moving matter, be it a rolling rock, flowing water, 
or falling ball, transfers a portion of its kinetic energy
to other matter. For example, an inelastic collision 
is one in which at least a portion of the kinetic 
energy of the colliding particles is lost. Potential ener-
gy, energy stored in a body, can be converted to
kinetic energy.
kinetochore
A specialized region or structure on the
centromere of chromosomes, the region that joins two
sister chromatids; links each sister chromatid to the
mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is the specialized
region on the chromatid where kinetochores and sister
chromatids attach. When a chromosome replicates
after mitosis or meiosis, it produces two side-by-side
chromatids, with each eventually becoming a separate
chromosome.
See also CENTROMERE.
kinetochore fibers
The microtubules that connect
kinetochores to spindle polar fibers.
kinetosome (basal body)
The structure at the base
of a flagellum or cilium that rises from the centriole
and consists of a cylinder composed of nine longitudi-
nally oriented, evenly spaced, triplet microtubules sur-
rounding one central pair, called the axoneme. Usually
found in pairs. Also called a blepharoplast. The type of
kinetosomes—based on number, structure, and posi-
tion—are used to type ciliates.

kingdom
Taxonomic name used to organize, classify,
and identify plants and animals. There are five taxo-
nomic kingdoms: Monera, Protista, Plantae, Fungi, and
Animalia. Only the domain is higher in ranking. This
system of ranking, called the Linnaean system, was
developed by the Swedish scientist Carolus Linnaeus
(1707–78), who developed a two-name system, bino-
mial nomenclature (genus and species), for identifying
and classifying all living things. The system is based on
a hierarchical structure in which organisms are sorted
by kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and
species. Organisms belonging to the same kingdom do
not have to be very similar, but organisms belonging to
the same species are very similar and can reproduce
and create offspring.
See also TAXON.
kinocilium
A long cilium at the apex of a hair cell,
along with other microvilla, that is used in the process
of hearing. It senses movement of cupula and is impor-
tant for balance.

The act of organizing individuals into social
groups, roles, and categories based on parentage, mar-
riage, or other criteria.

klinotaxis
A movement in a specific direction rela-
tive to a given stimulus, either directly toward or away
from the source.
Koch, Robert (1843–1910) German Bacteriologist
Robert Koch was born on December 11, 1843, in
Clausthal in the Upper Harz Mountains and is consid-
ered one of the fathers of modern medical bacteriolo-
gy (along with Louis Pasteur). The son of a mining
engineer, he taught himself to read by age five. He
attended the local high school and developed an inter-
est in biology.
In 1862 Koch attended the University of Göttingen
to study medicine under professor of anatomy Jacob
Henle. In 1840 Henle had published that living, para-
sitic organisms caused infectious diseases. In 1866
Koch married Emmy Fraats and they had one daughter.
After receiving his M.D. degree, Koch went to Berlin
for further study. In 1867, after a period as assistant in
the general hospital at Hamburg, he settled into general
practice at Langenhagen and, in 1869, at Rackwitz, in
the province of Posen. There he passed his district med-
ical officer’s examination, but in 1870 he volunteered
to serve in the Franco-Prussian War. From 1872 to
1880 he was district medical officer for Wollstein and
while there carried out his groundbreaking research.
Studying from his four-room flat, with a micro-
scope and other equipment he purchased, he began
research on anthrax, earlier discovered by other scien-
tists to be caused by a bacillus. Koch wanted to prove
whether or not anthrax was actually caused by the
bacillus, and he used mice and bacilli taken from the
spleens of dead farm animals. He found that the mice
did die from the bacillus and proved that the blood of
anthrax-infected animals transmitted it. He also showed
that the bacilli could produce resistance spores when
environmental conditions were unfavorable, and that
they could reemerge as viable anthrax-causing organ-
isms when conditions changed. Koch’s work became
internationally known when it was published in 1876.
He was the first person to establish a definite causal
connection between a particular disease and a particular
bacillus. He continued working on methods of studying
bacteria and in 1878 published his results that included
how to control infections caused by bacteria.
In 1880 he was appointed a member of the Reichs-
Gesundheitsamt (Imperial Health Bureau) in Berlin and
continued to refine his methods in bacteriological
research. He invented new methods of cultivating pure
cultures of bacteria on solid media and on agar kept in
the special kind of flat dish invented by his colleague
Petri, which is still in common use (the Petri dish). He
also developed new methods of staining bacteria, mak-
ing them easily visible for identification. All of this
work helped establish the methods to study pathogenic
bacteria easily in pure cultures. Koch also laid down the
conditions, known as Koch’s postulates, that must be
satisfied before it can be accepted that particular bacte-
ria cause particular diseases. These postulates were:
• The specific organism should be shown to be present
in every case of the disease.
• The specific microorganism should be isolated from
the diseased animal and grown in pure culture on
artificial laboratory media such as in a Petri dish.
• The freshly isolated microorganism, when inoculated
into a healthy laboratory animal, should cause the
same disease seen in the original animal.
• The microorganism should be recovered from the
experimentally infected animal.
Koch also discovered the tubercle bacillus, the
cause of tuberculosis, and developed a method of
growing it in pure culture, and in 1882, he published
his now classical work on the bacillus. In 1883 he was
sent to Egypt as leader of the German Cholera Com-
mission to investigate a cholera outbreak and soon dis-
covered the bacteria that causes cholera and brought
back pure cultures of it to Germany. He also studied
cholera in India.
Koch formulated rules for the control of epidemics
of cholera in 1893 and formed the basis of the methods
of control. His work on cholera was rewarded with a
prize of 100,000 German marks.
In 1885 Koch was appointed professor of hygiene
in the University of Berlin and director of the newly
established Institute of Hygiene in the university. Five
years later he was appointed brigadier general (gener-
alarzt) class I and freeman of the city of Berlin. In 1891
he became an honorary professor of the medical faculty
of Berlin and director of the new Institute for Infectious
Diseases. In 1893 Koch married Hedwig Freiberg.
Koch continued to travel and explore the causes of
many other diseases.
Koch was the recipient of many prizes and medals;
honorary doctorates from the Universities of Heidelberg
Koch, Robert
189

and Bologna; honorary citizenships of Berlin, Woll-
stein, and his native Clausthal; and honorary member-
ships of learned societies and academies in Berlin,
Vienna, Posen, Perugia, Naples, and New York. He
was awarded the German Order of the Crown, the
Grand Cross of the German Order of the Red Eagle,
and Orders from Russia and Turkey.
In 1905 Koch was awarded the Nobel Prize in
physiology or medicine for his pioneering work on
tuberculosis and continued his experimental work on
bacteriology and serology. He died on May 27, 1910,
in Baden-Baden.
Though he made great strides in the study of tuber-
culosis, today, 2 billion people worldwide suffer with
latent infection. There are 8 million new cases a year,
and up to 2 million annual deaths.
Kocher, Theodor Emil (1841–1917) Swiss Surgeon
Theodor Kocher was born on August 25, 1841, in
Berne, Switzerland, to a Swiss engineer. He received his
medical doctorate in Berne in 1865. In 1872 he became
ordinary professor of surgery and director of the Uni-
versity Surgical Clinic at Berne, where he remained for
the rest of his career.
He discovered a new method for the reduction of
dislocations of the shoulder in 1902, which he
explained in his Mobilization of the Duodenum.
He published numerous works on the thyroid
gland, hemostasis, antiseptic treatments, surgical infec-
tious diseases, gunshot wounds, and more. His book
Chirurgische Operationslehre
(Theory
on surgical
operations) reached six editions and was translated
into many languages. His book Erkrankungen der
Schilddrüse (Diseases of the thyroid gland) discussed
the etiology, symptology, and treatment of goiters. His
new ideas on the physiology and pathology of the thy-
roid gland caused great controversy, but after many
successful surgeries, his work on goiter treatment
became world known and accepted. In 1909 he
received the Nobel Prize for this work and donated the
prize money to create a research institute. Kocher
devised many new surgical techniques, instruments,
and appliances that carry his name, such as forceps
(Kocher and Ochsner/Kocher forceps, Kocher tweez-
ers), Kocher incision (in gallbladder surgery), the
Kocher vein (thyroid), Kocherization (surgery tech-
nique), and Kocher’s test (for thyroid-tracheomalacia).
The Kocher-Debré-Semélaigne syndrome is named for
him and Robert Debré and Georges Semélaigne. There
is also Kocher’s reflex (contraction of abdominal mus-
cles following moderate compression of the testicle)
and Kocher’s sign (eyelid movement). Kocher died in
Berne on July 27, 1917.
Koch’s postulates
Criteria proposed in the 19th cen-
tury by Nobel Prize winner (1905) Robert Koch to
determine whether a microbe is the cause of a particu-
lar infection. He laid down the following postulates,
which must be satisfied before it can be accepted that
particular bacteria cause particular diseases.
• The specific organism should be shown to be present
in every case of the disease.
• The specific microorganism should be isolated from
the diseased animal and grown in pure culture on
artificial laboratory media such as in a Petri dish.
• The freshly isolated microorganism, when inoculated
into a healthy laboratory animal, should cause the
same disease seen in the original animal.
• The microorganism should be recovered from the
experimentally infected animal.

Kossel, Ludwig Karl Martin Leonhard Albrecht
(1853–1927) German Chemist, Medical doctor
Lud-
wig Karl Martin Leonhard Albrecht Kossel was born in
Rostock on September 16, 1853, the eldest son of
Albrecht Kossel, a merchant and Prussian consul, and
his wife Clara Jeppe. He attended the secondary school
in Rostock and went to the newly founded University
of Strassburg in 1872 to study medicine. He received
his doctor of medicine in 1878.
Kossel specialized in chemistry of tissues and cells
(physiological chemistry), and by the 1870s he had
begun his investigations into the constitution of the cell
nucleus. He isolated nucleoproteins from the heads of
fish sperm cells in 1879. By the 1890s he had focused
on the study of the proteins. In 1910 he received the
Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his contribu-
tions in cell chemistry and work on proteins.
Among his important publications are Unter-
suchungen über die Nukleine und ihre Spal-
tungsproducte (Investigations into the nucleins and
190
Kocher, Theodor Emil

their cleavage products), 1881; Die Gewebe des men-
schlichen Körpers und ihre mikroskopische Unter-
suchung (The tissues in the human body and their
microscopic investigation), 1889–91, in two volumes,
with Behrens and Schieerdecker; and Leitfaden für
medizinisch-chemische Kurse (Textbook for medical-
chemical courses), 1888. He was also the author of Die
Probleme der Biochemie (The problems of biochem-
istry), 1908; and Die Beziehungen der Chemie zur
Physiologie (The relationships between chemistry and
physiology), 1913.
Kossel had honorary doctorates from the Universi-
ties of Cambridge, Dublin, Ghent, Greifswald, St.
Andrews, and Edinburgh, and he was a member of var-
ious scientific societies, including the Royal Swedish
Academy of Sciences and the Royal Society of Sciences
of Uppsala. Albrecht Kossel died on July 5, 1927.
Krakatoa
An island volcano along the Indonesian
arc, between the islands of Sumatra and Java. Krakatoa
erupted in 1883 in one of the largest eruptions in histo-
ry and was heard as far away as Madagascar (2,200
miles). The volcanic dust veil that created spectacular
atmospheric effects, like vivid red sunsets, acted as a
solar radiation filter, lowering global temperatures as
much as 1.2°C in the year after the eruption. Tempera-
tures did not return to normal until 1888.
Krebs, Sir Hans Adolf (1900–1981) German Bio-
chemist
Sir 
Hans 
Adolf 
Krebs 
was 
born 
in
Hildesheim, Germany, on August 25, 1900, to Georg
Krebs, M.D., an ear, nose, and throat surgeon of that
city, and his wife Alma (née Davidson).
Krebs was educated at the Gymnasium Andreanum
at Hildesheim. Between 1918 and 1923 he studied
medicine at the Universities of Göttingen, Freiburg-im-
Breisgau, and Berlin. He received an M.D. degree at the
University of Hamburg in 1925. In 1926 he was
appointed assistant to Professor Otto Warburg at the
Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology at Berlin-Dahlem,
where he remained until 1930. He was forced to leave
Germany in 1933 because of his Jewish background.
In 1934 he was appointed demonstrator of bio-
chemistry at the University of Cambridge, and the fol-
lowing year was appointed lecturer in pharmacology at
the University of Sheffield. In 1938 he became the
newly founded lecturer-in-charge of the Department of
Biochemistry. In 1939 he became an English citizen. By
1945 he was a professor and director of the Medical
Research Council’s research unit established in the
department. In 1954 he was appointed Whitley Profes-
sor of Biochemistry in the University of Oxford, and
the Medical Research Council’s Unit for Research in
Cell Metabolism was transferred to Oxford.
At the University of Freiburg in 1932, he discov-
ered a series of chemical reactions (now known as the
urea cycle) by which ammonia is converted to urea in
mammalian tissue. For his discoveries of chemical reac-
tions in living organisms now known as the citric acid
cycle or the Krebs cycle, he was awarded the 1953
Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. These reactions
involve the conversion, in the presence of oxygen, of
substances that are formed by the breakdown of sug-
ars, fats, and protein components to carbon dioxide,
water, and energy-rich compounds.
Krebs was a member of many scientific societies,
winning many awards and citations for his work, and
published works including Energy Transformations in
Living Matter (1957) with British biochemist Hans
Kornberg. He was knighted in 1958. He died on
November 22, 1981, in Oxford, England.
Krebs cycle
A biochemical cycle in the second stage
of cellular respiration involving eight steps that com-
pletes the metabolic breakdown of glucose molecules
to carbon dioxide. Acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) is com-
bined with oxaloacetate to form citric acid. Citric acid
is then converted into a number of other chemicals,
and carbon dioxide is released. The process takes
place within the mitochondrion. Also called the citric
acid cycle or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, it was
conceived and published by scientist Hans Adolf
Krebs in 1957.
Krogh, Schack August Steenberg (1874–1949)
Danish Physiologist
Schack 
August 
Steenberg
Krogh was born in Grenaa, Jutland, Denmark, on
November 15, 1874, to Viggo Krogh, a shipbuilder,
later brewery master, and Marie Drechmann. He
earned his upper secondary school diploma at the
Cathedral School of Århus in 1893 and entered the
University of Copenhagen in 1893. He began his
Krogh, Schack August Steenberg
191

studies in medicine but turned to zoology, an early
childhood interest.
In 1897 he began work for Christian Bohr at the
laboratory of medical physiology and later became his
assistant. In 1916 he became chair of the zoophysiolo-
gy department at the University of Copenhagen, a posi-
tion he held until he retired in 1945.
In 1904 he constructed a microtonometer, making
it possible to determine the gas content of blood with
great precision. He established that the movement of
gases between the alveoli and the blood occurs through
passive diffusion. With exercise physiologist Johannes
Lindhard, Krogh began the field of exercise physiology
in Scandinavia between 1910 and 1915. He developed
an 
automatically 
controlled 
bicycle 
ergometer
(1910–11) that is still in use today for exercise. He also
demonstrated that muscles burn fat during exercise,
and included in his inventions was a climate chamber
that could be carried to measure continuous tempera-
ture and humidity over a 24-hour period. For his work
on capillaries, discovering capillary-motor-regulating
mechanisms, he received the Nobel Prize in physiology
or medicine in 1920. Some of his important writings
include The Anatomy and Physiology of Capillaries

H20
In the Krebs cycle acetyl (from
pyruvate) is broken down to CO2
and H. The H is held in NADH (from
reduction of NAD). The NADH then 
is reoxidized in an electron transport
chain, with production of ATP.

krummholz
Trees that grow near the tree line and
that are profoundly shaped by wind and ice, often
twisted and flaglike or stunted. Krummholz literally
means “crooked wood.”
K-selection
Natural selection, or pattern of repro-
duction, that occurs in populations at or near the car-
rying capacity (K) of a normally stable environment.
Characteristics of these populations are slow reproduc-
tion, increased longevity of individuals, delayed maturi-
ty of offspring, or reduction in the number of offspring,
with increased level of parental care. In effect, the K-
selection strategy is to ensure maximum survival of the
individual over that of reproductive capacity. A prime
example is humans.
See also R-SELECTION.
k-T boundary
A transitional stage in geology from
the end of the Cretaceous (k) to the beginning of the
Tertiary (T), approximately 65 million years ago. Also
pertains to a site or area showing evidence of rocks and
other materials from both periods. There is a super-
abundance of iridium and osmium isotopes typical of
meteorites in this zone, and this has led some to suggest
that the mass extinction of species including dinosaurs
was caused by a large Earth collision with asteroids or
meteorites.
kuru (trembling disease)
A slowly progressive and
fatal disease of the brain; a human transmissible
spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) caused by a prion.
Found in New Guinea and transmitted when people
handled and ate the brains of their dead relatives, a
cannibalistic ritual in Papua New Guinea.

labile
The term has loosely been used to describe
either a relatively unstable and transient chemical
species or a relatively STABLE but reactive species.
See also INERT.
lability
Instability; refers to a state that is easily
altered or modified. A phenotype’s capacity to respond
differentially to varying environmental conditions. Also
called phenotypic plasticity.
laccase
A copper-containing ENZYME, 1,4-benzenedi-
ol oxidase, found in higher plants and microorganisms.
Laccases are MULTICOPPER OXIDASES of wide specificity
that carry out one-electron oxidation of phenolic and
related compounds and reduce O2 to water. The
enzymes are polymeric and generally contain one each
of TYPE 1, TYPE 2, TYPE 3 COPPER centers per SUBUNIT,
where the type 2 and type 3 are close together, forming
a trinuclear copper CLUSTER.
See also NUCLEARITY.
lactate
Alternate name for lactic acid, a chemical cre-
ated from sugars when broken down for energy in the
absence of oxygen.
lacteal
Numerous small lymphatic vessels in the inte-
rior of each intestinal villus, small fingerlike projections
of the mucosal layer of the small intestine, that 
picks up chyme, a thick semifluid mass of partially
digested food, and passes it through the lymph system
via the thoracic duct to the blood system; aids in the
absorption of fats.
lactoferrin
An iron-binding protein from milk, struc-
turally similar to the TRANSFERRINs.
lagging strand
In DNA synthesis, polymerization
occurs both in and away from the nearest replication
fork. One of two newly created DNA strands is the lag-
ging strand. Found at the replication fork on linear
chromosomes, it is synthesized in the direction away
from the replication fork. It is the synthesis of a new
strand of replication DNA by the creation of short seg-
ments of various lengths that are later joined together
covalently by the enzyme DNA ligase.
It is made in discontinuous lengths, called Ozark
fragments, in the 5’ to 3’ growing-tip (number of atoms
in the sugar residues) direction during DNA polymer-
ization, and these are joined covalently at a later time.
Since it is not synthesized continuously, it is called dis-
continuous replication.
The difference between the lagging and leading
strands is due to the orientation of the parent template
strands. The leading-strand template is facing a 5’ to 3’
direction, but the lagging strand itself is oriented in the
3’ to 5’ direction, so the DNA polymerase responsible
195
L

for adding nucleotides has to move backwards away
from the replication fork; synthesis is therefore not
continuous, but in repeated steps.
There is a gap between the final lagging strand seg-
ment and the end of the chromosome. As a result, the
5’ end of the lagging strand will lose some nucleotide
every time a cell replicates its DNA.

Lamarckism
The idea, promoted by Jean Baptiste de
Lamarck, that acquired traits can be passed from par-
ent to offspring, i.e., that characteristics or traits
acquired during a single lifetime can be transmitted
directly to offspring.
land bridges
Pieces of land once connecting the con-
tinents that have since sunk into the sea as part of a
general cooling and contraction of the Earth. Believed
to have served as migratory passages for animals,
plants, and humans.
Landsteiner, Karl (1868–1943) Austrian Biochemist
Karl Landsteiner was born in Vienna on June 14, 1868,
to Leopold Landsteiner, a journalist and newspaper
publisher, and Fanny Hess. Landsteiner studied
medicine at the University of Vienna, graduating in
1891.
From 1898 until 1908 he held the post of assistant
in the university department of pathological anatomy
in Vienna. In 1908 he received the appointment as pro-
sector in the Wilhelminaspital in Vienna, and in 1911
he became professor of pathological anatomy at the
University of Vienna.
Landsteiner, with a number of collaborators, pub-
lished many papers on his findings in anatomy and
immunology, such as the immunology of syphilis and
the Wassermann reaction, and he discovered the
immunological factors, which he named haptens. He
also laid the foundations of the cause and immunology
of poliomyelitis.
His 1901 discovery of the major blood groups
and his development of the ABO system of blood typ-
ing and 1909 classification of the blood of human
beings into the now well-known A, B, AB, and O
groups, as well as the M and N groups, made blood
transfusion a routine medical practice. For this work,
he
received the Nobel Prize for physiology or
medicine in 1930. In 1936 he wrote The Specificity of
Serological Reactions, a classic text that helped to
establish the science of immunochemistry. In 1940 he
discovered the Rh factor, the protein on the surface of
red blood cells that determines if the blood type is
positive (Rh-positive) or negative (Rh-negative). If the
mother has a negative Rh factor (Rh-negative) and the
father and fetus are Rh-positive, the mother can
become Rh-sensitized and produce antibodies to com-
bat fetal blood cells that cross the placenta into her
bloodstream. These antibodies can destroy the fetus’s
Rh-positive blood cells, putting it at serious risk of
anemia.
In 1939 he became emeritus professor at the Rock-
efeller Institute. On June 24, 1943, he had a heart
attack in his laboratory and died two days later.
larva
The solitary live, but sexually immature,
form of a variety of animal life cycles, e.g., butter-
flies, flies, wasps, that may, after reaching adulthood,
be completely different in morphology, habitat
requirements, and food needs. Some larvae have
other names, like maggots for flies, grub for beetle
larvae, tadpoles for frogs, etc. Insect larvae may molt,
i.e., shed layers of skin, several times during their
development.
latentiated drug
See DRUG LATENTIATION.
lateral line system
A sensory system composed of a
longitudinal row of porelike openings that open into
tubes in skin on the sides of fish and larval amphibians
that is used to detect water and electrical disturbance in
their surroundings. The ampullary organs, or ampullae
of Lorenzina in fish, detect weak electrical currents
generated by other animals, while the neuromasts—a
small group of pairs of oppositely oriented hair sensory
cells embedded in a gel-filled cupula on either side of
the skin surface or in pit organs—detect the direction
of water movement. The lateral canal is the portion 
of the system located on the head, beginning at the
196
Lamarckism

junction with the supra and infraorbital canals behind
the mid-eye, and extending back to the rear of the head
connecting to the lateral line.
lateral meristem
An embryonic tissue, the meristem,
on the portion of a plant that gives rise to secondary
growth such as the cambium, vascular cambium, and
cork cambium. Runs most of the length of stems and
roots. Also called the cambium.
Laurasia
Laurasia was the northern supercontinent
formed after PANGAEA broke up during the JURASSIC
PERIOD some 180 million years ago and formed 
the present continents of North America, Europe, and
Asia as well as the land masses of Greenland and 
Iceland.
lava
Igneous rock, magma that exits volcanoes and
vents and reaches the exterior or surface of the land or
seabed.
Laveran, Charles-Louis-Alphonse (1845–1922) French
Physician, Protozoologist Charles-Louis-Alphonse Lav-
eran was born in Paris on June 18, 1845, in the house
at 19 rue de l’Est, to Dr. Louis Théodore Laveran, an
army doctor and professor at the École de Val-
de-Grâce, and Guénard de la Tour, the daughter and
granddaughter of high-ranking army commanders.
After completing his education in Paris at the 
Collège Saint Baube and later at the Lycée Louis-
le-Grand, he applied to the Public Health School at
Strasbourg in 1863 and attended the school for four
years. In 1866 he was appointed a resident medical
student in the Strasbourg civil hospitals, and the fol-
lowing year he submitted a thesis on the regeneration
of nerves. In 1874 he was appointed to the chair of
military diseases and epidemics at the École de Val-
de-Grâce, previously occupied by his father, and in
1878, when his period of office had ended, he moved
to Bône in Algeria until 1883. It was during this peri-
od that he carried out his chief researches on the
human malarial parasites, first at Bône and later at
Constantine.
In 1880 Laveran examined blood samples from
malarial patients and discovered amoebalike organisms
growing within red blood cells, and he noticed that
they divided, formed spores, and invaded unaffected
blood cells. He also noted that the spores were released
in each affected red cell at the same time and corre-
sponded with a fresh attack of fever in the patient. His
researches confirmed that the blood parasites that he
had described were in fact the cause of malaria, but his
first publications on the malaria parasites were received
with skepticism until scientists around the world pub-
lished confirmative research results. In 1889 the Acade-
my of Sciences awarded him the Bréant Prize for his
discovery.
In 1896 he entered the Pasteur Institute as chief of
the Honorary Service, and from 1897 until 1907 he
carried out many original research projects on
endoglobular haematozoa and on sporozoa and try-
panosomes. In 1907 he was awarded the Nobel Prize
for his work on protozoa in causing diseases. In 1908
he founded the Société de Pathologie Exotique, over
which he presided for 12 years.
He was the first to express the view that the malar-
ial parasite must be a parasite of Culicidae, and after
this view had been proved by the research of Ronald
Ross, he played a large part in the enquiry on the rela-
tionships between Anopheles and malaria in the cam-
paign undertaken against endemic disease in swamps,
notably in Corsica and Algeria.
From 1900 on, he studied the trypanosomes and
published, either independently or in collaboration
with others, a large number of papers on these blood
parasites. His research concentrated on the try-
panosomes of the rat; the trypanosomes that cause
nagana and surra; the trypanosome of horses in Gam-
bia; a trypanosome of cattle in the Transvaal; the try-
panosomiases of the Upper Niger; the trypanosomes of
birds, chelonians, batrachians, and fishes; and finally
the trypanosome that causes the endemic disease of
equatorial Africa known as sleeping sickness. For 27
years he worked on pathogenic protozoa and the field
he opened up by his discovery of the malarial parasites.
He died on May 18, 1922.
law of equal segregation
Gregor Mendel’s first law,
which says that two copies of a gene separate during
law of equal segregation
197

meiosis and end up in different gametes (sperm and
ova) and are passed on to offspring.
law of independent assortment
Gregor Mendel’s
second law, which says that after gametes form, the
separation of alleles for one gene is independent of the
separation of alleles for other genes; genes located on
nonhomologous chromosomes are independent from
one another. This is not true for genes that are linked,
where genes are located close to one another on the
same chromosome.
lead discovery
The process of identifying active new
chemical entities that, by subsequent modification, can
be transformed into a clinically useful DRUG.
lead generation
The term applied to strategies devel-
oped to identify compounds that possess a desired but
nonoptimized biological activity.
leading strand
One of two new DNA strands that is
being replicated continuously, unlike the lagging strand.
The strand is made in the 5’ to 3’ direction, placing an
–OH group at the 3’ end for continuous polymerization
(adding nucleotides) at the 3’ growing tip by DNA poly-
merase that moves forward when the template strands
unwind at the replication fork. It is the DNA polymerase
that plays the pivotal role in the process of life, since it is
responsible for duplicating the genetic information.
See also LAGGING STRAND.
lead optimization
The synthetic modification of a
biologically active compound to fulfill all stereoelec-
tronic, physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, and toxico-
logic requirements for clinical usefulness.
leaf primordia
Young leaves at the tip of a shoot
formed by the shoot apical meristem.
leaf veins
A netlike network called reticulate vena-
tion in vascular tissue in dicots. The veins are in paral-
lel venation to each other in monocots.
learned behavior
Behavior that is not fixed but
acquired by trial and error or by observing others.
leghemoglobin
A monomeric HEMOGLOBIN synthe-
sized in the root nodules of leguminous plants that are
host to nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Has a high affinity
for dioxygen and serves as an oxygen supply for the
bacteria.
See also NITROGEN FIXATION.
legume
A pod-bearing plant that is a member of the
Leguminosae (Fabaceae) or pea or bean family. These
plants form symbiotic relationships with certain nitro-
gen-fixing bacteria (rizobia) in their root nodules to
acquire nitrogen for growth. Examples include beans,
peas, lentils, alfalfa, clover, and wildflowers like wild
blue lupine (Lupinus perennis).
lek
A place where males display in groups and
females choose for the purpose of fertilization; a special
kind of polygynous mating system.
lemur
Primates (prosimians) of the superfamily
Lemuroidea that live in trees; found only on 
the island of Madagascar and the adjacent tiny
Comoro Islands. Related to monkeys, they have large
eyes, foxlike faces, and long furry tails (not prehen-
sile). There are only about 30 to 50 living species, 
17 of which are endangered. They are small, 
ranging from about an ounce up to about the size of
a house cat.
lenticle
A pore where gases are exchanged in the
stems of woody plants.
Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) Italian Scientist,
Artist
Leonardo da Vinci, one of the greatest minds of
all time, was born on April 15, 1452, near the town of
Anchiano near Vinci. He was an illegitimate child of a
notary, Piero da Vinci, and a peasant woman named
Caterina. In his teenage years he became an apprentice
in one of the best art studios in Italy in 1469, that of
198
law of independent assortment

Andrea Verrocchio, a leading Renaissance master of
that time. During this time da Vinci drew La valle del-
l’Arno (The Arno Valley) in 1473 and painted an angel
in Verrocchio’s Baptism of Christ (1475). In 1478 da
Vinci became an independent master. Da Vinci is
famous for his works of art such as the Mona Lisa, but
he is also as famous for his visionary drawings of
instruments and machines of the future. He was an
artist, scientist, engineer, and architect. He was also
one of the first to take detailed observations and to
experiment in a scientific manner.
In his later notebook the Codex Leicester, one
finds the largest assemblage of da Vinci’s studies relat-
ing to astronomy, meteorology, paleontology, geogra-
phy, and geology. It reveals that his profound
scientific observations far outweigh anyone else of his
time and documents his passion for research and
invention. His interest in light and shadow led him to
notice how the earth, moon, and planets all reflect
sunlight, for example.
The central topic of the Codex Leicester is the
“Body of the Earth” and in particular its transforma-

He was well acquainted with knowledge about
his local rocks and fossils (Cenozoic mollusks) and
was uncannily prescient in his interpretation of 
how fossils were found in mountains, theorizing that 
they had once been living organisms in seas before
mountains were raised. Da Vinci contributed a 
great deal of knowledge to human anatomy with
detailed drawings and notes in his anatomical 
notebooks after having dissected some 19 human
cadavers.
Unfortunately, many of his scientific projects and
treatises were never completed, since he recorded his
technical notes and sketches in numerous notebooks
and used mirror script (his writing had to be read in a
mirror to be deciphered). It was centuries before the
genius of da Vinci was recognized. He died at the age of
67 on May 2, 1519, at Cloux, near Amboise, France.
Lepidoptera
The taxonomic order that includes
butterflies, skippers, and moths. Butterflies have
antennae, compound eyes, six pair of legs, a hard
exoskeleton, and a body that is divided into a head,
thorax, and abdomen. The butterfly’s outer body is
covered by tiny sensory hairs and has wings covered
by scales.
lesion
A visible region, such as a wound or fissure,
where there is abnormal tissue change in a body part; a
structural change due to wound, injury, or disease.
lethal mutation
A mutant form of a gene that 
will result in the inviability (death) of the organism 
if expressed in its phenotype. A conditional-lethal
mutation is lethal under one condition but not under
another.
leukemia
Cancer of the developing blood cells in the
bone marrow. The rampant overproduction of white
blood cells (leukocytes). A fatal cancer that is diag-
nosed yearly in 29,000 adults and 2,000 children in the
United States. There are several types of leukemia.
See also CANCER.
leukocyte (white blood cell)
A type of blood cell that
contains a nucleus but has no pigment. White blood
cells (WBC) are found in the blood and are involved in
defending the body against infective organisms and for-
eign substances. They are produced in the bone marrow
along with other types of blood cells. There are five
types of white blood cell within two main groups, and
each has its own characteristics. The polymorphonucle-
ar or granulocyte group comprises the neutrophils,
eosinophils, and basophils. The mononuclear group
comprises the monocytes and lymphocytes.
White blood cells are the main attackers of foreign
substances as part of the immune system.
Neutrophils move out of the blood vessels into the
infected tissue and engulf the foreign substances
(phagocytosis). Eosinophils migrate to body tissues and
release toxic substances to kill foreign substances.
Basophils, also called granular leukocytes, digest for-
eign objects from granules containing toxic chemicals.
Monocytes, which contain chemicals and enzymes,
ingest dead cells through phagocytosis and develop into

Silk Degrees: A Tale of Moths and People,
Part One
By James G. (Spider) Barbour
Silk moths are found around the world, in all hemispheres,
mostly in the tropics and temperate zones. Silk moths, a
group containing not only many of the world’s most useful
insects, but also many of the largest and most spectacularly
beautiful, have had a long and positive impact on people’s
lives. The silk moths comprise two families, the Bombycine
silk moths (family Bombycidae) and the Saturniids or giant
silk moths (family Saturniidae).
Collectively, they inhabit nearly every type of ecosys-
tem within their tremendous geographic range, from
forests to prairies to mountains to deserts. Most silk moths
are medium to large species, with a good number of enor-
mous ones and very few small types. Like all lepidoptera
(butterflies and moths), any silk moth has a four-stage life
cycle, or complete metamorphosis, in which it begins life
as an egg; hatches into a hungry, fast-growing caterpillar;
enters a resting stage as a pupa; and transforms at last
into a winged, reproductive adult. Most adult silk moths do
not eat at all, having built up an ample supply of fat
reserves in the caterpillar stage. Silk moth caterpillars are
eating machines, growing from tiny hatchlings smaller than
rice grains into fat sausagelike creatures, the largest the
size of fingers. Most feed on leaves or some other plant
material, tending to move from branch to branch, eating a
leaf here and a leaf there, in order to avoid consuming their
cover and camouflage.
After feeding, some species burrow into the ground or
simply crawl under a sheltering object, molting one last time
to form the sleeping pupa, a limbless ovoid or cylindrical
thing, capable of nothing more than wiggling and twisting.
To further protect this vulnerable life stage, many caterpil-
lars provide a shield for the pupa, a cocoon made of silk,
which is issued from large glands within the caterpillar’s
body and spun out through organs near its mouth called
spinnerettes. Depending on the species and its habitat, a
cocoon may be spun inside a rolled leaf, attached to a twig,
spun among grass blades, placed under overhanging rocks,
or deposited in the grooves of a tree trunk’s rough bark. In
temperate climates, the pupae typically remain dormant
within their cocoons, the moths developing in the warmth of
spring and emerging in summer. Some genera, such as the
buck moths (Hemileuca), overwinter as eggs, deposited by
the autumn-emerging females in thick rings on twigs or
stems of the host plants.
The material of cocoons has been a part of human cul-
ture for thousands of years, probably having been discov-
ered and used before the beginning of recorded history for
purposes we can only guess at. The technology for the man-
ufacture of silk fabric and the farming of silkworms (sericul-
ture) dates back at least 4,000 years to ancient China, where
it was a closely guarded secret until the third century B.C.E.,
when the Japanese acquired it. From there, silk production
and the making of silk garments spread widely.

The first requirement of silk-making is the gathering
of moth cocoons for processing into long threads for
weaving the fabric. The earliest source of cocoons was
almost certainly local wild moth populations. Silk-makers
must have soon learned which moth species produced the
best and most easily processed silk. The next step may
have been some form of silk-moth domestication. In its
simplest form, this might have meant securing eggs from
fertile females and raising the caterpillars in protective
custody on appropriate food plants, either living plants or
fresh-cut foliage, in much the way amateur silk-moth
enthusiasts raise them today. In time, however, more
sophisticated, assembly-line-style rearing techniques
were developed in which caterpillars were reared en
masse indoors in containers.
Only one species of silk moth, the mulberry silkworm
moth (Bombyx mori), a member of the family Bombycidae,
has been completely domesticated. This species appears
to have been selectively bred for rearing the caterpillars
on flat screen trays stacked in tiers, an extremely space-
efficient means of production. Over time, silk producers
developed caterpillars lacking the velcrolike ends of the
abdominal legs (called “prolegs,” as they are not true
legs), so that they did not crawl off the breeding trays, but
stayed there feeding as long as they were supplied with
leaves. A singular advantage to this species is that the
cocoon, after the gummy sericin is boiled away, unravels
in one long, unbroken thread of fibrin, an extremely strong
and supple protein. The cocoons of saturniid silk moths
cannot be so easily untangled, nor is the resulting silk of
such refined quality. Saturniid sericulture utilizes cocoons
of several Asian species of the genus Antheraea, which
also contains the familiar North American polyphemus
moth (Antheraea polyphemus). In China, the coarse silk
from Antheraea and a few other genera has long been
used for everyday garments, including sturdy work
clothes.
In North America, early colonial settlements in the 
Carolinas and Georgia produced silk for local use using 
the mulberry silkworm. Later, in the middle 19th century,
commercial silk production was promoted in Europe and
North America as a viable industry, but startups in the Unit-
ed States, mostly along the east and west coasts, proved
too costly against foreign competition, bringing American
sericulture to an early end. Its legacy remains, however, in
the form of one lovely moth and its host plant, and in the
form of an unlovely moth that haunts the Northeast to this
day. A major silk promoter, the Frenchman Léopold Trou-
velot, imported both moths in the 1860s.
The good moth is the ailanthus silk moth (Samia cyn-
thia), which feeds in the wild only on the tree imported as
food for its caterpillars, the tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus
altissima), also known as “stink-tree” for the musty smell of
the male flowers. The moth and the tree grow in many
cities, mostly along the east coast, with scattered occur-
rences as distant as Pittsburgh and St. Louis.
Trouvelot’s other introduction is the notorious gypsy
moth (Lymantra dispar). Having escaped from Trouvelot’s
unsuccessful crossbreeding experiments with the mulberry
silk moth (Bombyx mori), the gypsy moth invaded the local
New England forests and spread, becoming perhaps the
most devastating forest insect pest in the Northeast, with
periodic outbreaks defoliating millions of acres of trees.
Most trees recover, and the gypsy moth populations plum-
met after one to three years, so there is no lasting damage.
The ailanthus silk moth is well behaved by comparison,
never spreading from cities into the countryside, nor attack-
ing trees other than its natural host. Though tree-of-heaven
is widespread in disturbed portions of rural areas (along
highways and power-line cuts, for example), the moth is
never found in these wilder places, only in sooty railroad
yards, unkempt used car lots and junk yards, and similar
sites. Probably the caterpillars are so vulnerable to our
native predators and parasites that inevitably all are killed

Sassafras and Its Lepidopteran Cohorts, or
Bigger and Better Caterpillars through
Chemistry
by Timothy L. McCabe, Ph.D.
Joyfull News of the Newe Founde World was published in
1577, the first European pharmacopoeia to catalog materi-
als from the Americas. In this work by Spanish physician
Nicolás Monardes, we are told of the use of sassafras
root bark for fever, liver discomfort, headache, bronchial
congestion, stomach ailments, kidney stones, gout,
toothache, arthritis, constipation, and infertility. Sassafras
root bark became a principal export to Europe, second
only to tobacco.
Sassafras is a member of the family Lauraceae, which
comprises approximately 40 genera and more than 2,000
species. Besides sassafras, other familiar members
include the cinnamon trees of the Orient, the West Indian
avocado pear, and spicebush. Early accounts of New
World explorers cite enormous populations of the sas-
safras tree along the entire Eastern Seaboard. Our native
sassafras occurs from Maine to Michigan, and south to
Florida and Texas.
Sassafras oil possesses a sweet, woody flavor and
was widely employed to flavor toothpaste and soft drinks,
particularly root beer, prior to 1960. It was discovered to be
a carcinogen and banned from products after 1960. A hallu-
cinogenic drug known as Ecstasy is derived from safrole, a
secondary plant substance obtained from the roots of sas-
safras. Today, sassafras tea, produced by steeping the
young roots, remains a fixture in Appalachian folk culture as
a “spring tonic” and “blood thinner.”
There are an estimated 100,000–400,000 different sec-
ondary compounds in plants. Secondary plant substances
are those products not known to have any function in plant
growth or metabolism. They were once thought to represent
waste or by-products of plant metabolism. Current thinking
associates these substances with chemical defenses
against herbivores. Ironically, these same plant chemicals
sometimes provide the herbivore with protection: monarch
caterpillars store cardenolides, vertebrate heart poisons,
obtained from their milkweed host.
Plants can even manufacture insect hormones. The
“paper factor” story is a famous example. K. Slma came
from Czechoslovakia to spend a year in C. M. Williams’s lab-
oratory at Harvard. He brought along his favorite laboratory
except in the “enemy-free space” (Tuskes et al., 1996) of
urban environments.
As food for human consumption, giant silk moths hold
an important place in some cultures, and they might in 
Western culture were it not for an ubiquitous and intense
aversion to eating insects among Europeans and Euro-
Americans. Native American cultures of the Southwest
included in their regular diet the caterpillars and pupae of
the pinion pine moths (genus Coloradia). Throughout south-
ern Africa, larvae and pupae of the native silk moths are
eaten, fully integrated into local cuisines as appetizers, main
dishes, and ingredients in soups and stews. Caterpillars of
some species, such as the widespread and often abundant
“Mopane worm” (Gonimbrasia belina), are frequently sold at
markets. In China, surplus pupae from silk farms were com-
monly eaten in soups and rice-based dishes.
Today, as much silk-moth rearing occurs for enjoyment
as for silk production. Breeders sell and swap cocoons and
eggs, and share rearing tips and experiences. The world’s
silk-moth lovers have become more closely bonded by the
Internet, with Web sites and forums uniting moth buffs from
many nations. “The World’s Largest Saturniidae Site,” main-
tained by Bill Oehlke, a silk-moth fanatic who picked up the
habit from his father, Don Oehlke, can be visited at

insect, Pyrrhocoris apterus, a native European bug. Grow-
ing in Williams’s laboratory, the bugs went through an extra
stage to form giant, sexually immature, sixth-instar nymphs.
These ultimately died without becoming sexually mature. All
aspects of their rearing were studiously examined, and the
culprit was determined to be the paper toweling used to line
the cages. The toweling was derived from the balsam fir, a
pulp tree indigenous to North America. This was the first
indication of the existence of juvenile hormones naturally
occurring in plants. Molting hormone, alpha ecdysone, has
been found in ferns and various other plants. Apparently
alpha ecdysone may not be at high enough concentrations
to disrupt insect metabolism in every plant where it occurs;
this has been demonstrated in ferns. Perhaps it represents
an intermediate condition in the continual struggle for sur-
vival between plant and herbivore.
Secondary plant substances can also serve as cues
for the insect to feed. Sinigrin, a mustard oil glycoside, is
found in the turnip aphid’s natural foodplants. When sinigrin
is sprayed on plants not acceptable to the aphids, feeding
commences and the aphid often does as well or better than
on its normal host. A parasitoid of the cabbage aphid
locates its prey by the smell of sinigrin. Highly aromatic
camphor compounds, safrole (oil of sassafras) and syringin
(a glycoside), are all secondary plant substances charac-
teristic of sassafras. Syringin, a glycoside common in lilac
(genus Syringa), should not be confused with the previously
mentioned sinigrin. R. D. Gibbs in his Chemotaxonomly of
Flowering Plants, published in 1974, states: “Syringin is rela-
tively rare in the Plant Kingdom, and positive results from
the Syringin Test are therefore of considerable interest.”
The geographic distribution of the Saturniidae, as
well as that of other members of the superfamily, com-
bined with high endemism and disjunct distributions, are
all indicative of an ancient lineage. Saturniidae and
Apatelodidae, being ancient lineages, coevolved with the
Lauraceae (among the most primitive flowering plants)
and secondarily adapted to modern plants. Apatelodes
torrefacta is still on sassafras, but its largely sympatric
relative, Olceclostera angelica, is on ash and lilac, a pecu-
liar association repeated by other sassafras lepidopter-
ans, notably the promethea moth and the tiger swallowtail.
The latter two also use cherry as does A. torrefacta. Ash,
lilac, and cherry possess syringin, a glycoside that has
been found in virtually all Oleaceae (includes lilac and
ash), cherry, most Lauraceae (including spicebush and
sassafras), as well as Magnoliaceae (magnolia). Privet
also has syringin and is widely used by moth breeders as
a substitute plant for rearing exotic saturniids.
Few lepidopterans feed on sassafras. Significantly,
those that do are among our largest species (giant silk
moths) or are large members of their respective families
(e.g., Epimecis hortaria in the Geometridae). By some
mechanism, possibly secondary plant substances, sas-
safras may be driving lepidoptera toward “bigness.” Swal-
lowtails reared on sassafras produced heavier pupae than
those reared on other, even preferred, host plants. Despite
their long association, smaller members of the Saturniidae,
e.g., Anisota, do not utilize sassafras. W. T. M. Forbes in
The Lepidoptera of New York and Neighboring States
(1923) cites only four records for all microlepidopteran 
families on sassafras. This is in contrast to the list for 
the Saturniidae: Automeris io, Callosamia promethea, 
C. angulifera, Hyalophora cecropia, Antheraea polyphe-
mus, Eacles imperialis, and Citheronia regalis.
Strikingly few lepidopterans have secondarily adapted
to sassafras. The Noctuidae, a diverse family (over 3,000
species in the United States) of recent lineage, has only one
host record for sassafras, Hypsoropha hormos. This species
may have made the jump from persimmon (Ebenaceae),
upon which it and its congeners normally feed, to sassafras
by seeking kaempferol, a phenolic acid held in common by
both plant families. Persimmon is a favorite of the luna moth.
The luna, as a large member of the Saturniidae, is unusual in
not using sassafras. Another secondary specialist is the
spicebush swallowtail that feeds on both spicebush and
sassafras, which have syringin in common. Syringin is rare
in plants and makes it difficult to fathom the pathway that led
the spicebush swallowtail to sassafras. Perhaps safrole is
the common link in this case. Sassafras and pipevine both
possess safrole. Pipevine (Aristolochia) serves as a host for
the pipevine swallowtail, while sassafras serves as a host
for the spicebush swallowtail. The pipevine and the spice-
bush swallowtails even mimic one another.
For a tree, sassafras does very well on poor soils. It
possesses a very deep taproot. One should seek saplings
less than a foot tall for transplant or else plan to do a lot of
digging. It is a favorite deer browse and quickly becomes
eliminated in the understory where deer are dominant. The
variously lobed leaves are unusual and nearly unique for
the Northeast. Sassafras leaves on the forest floor will
attract adult lepidopterans that probe the decomposing tis-
sues. Such feeding behavior has also been observed with
fallen cherry leaves.

lice
Small (<1/6 in. long) wingless insects (Arthropoda:
Insecta) that have three pairs of legs, and a body com-
posed of a head, thorax, and abdomen. They have flat-
tened, elongate bodies and somewhat oval heads and a
three-stage life cycle (egg, nymph, and adult). The
nymphs molt three times before reaching maturity.
There are two suborders of lice, Mallophagorida
(chewing lice, broad heads with biting mouthparts) and
Anoplurorida (sucking lice, narrow heads with sucking
mouthparts), and they are found worldwide.
Human lice come in three forms: head lice (Pedicu-
lus humanus capitis), body lice (Pediculus humanus
humanus), and pubic lice (Pediculus pubis). They feed
exclusively on humans, and their survival depends on
temperature and humidity conditions associated with
human bodies. They desiccate rapidly if they are away
from humans for more than 24–36 hours.
lichen
Lichens are two organisms in one: Having no
roots, stems, or leaves, they actually are symbiotic
associations of a fungus and a photosynthesizing part-
ner that results in a stable thallus of specific structure.
The fungus is almost always an ascomycete, very
rarely a basidiomycete (about 20 basidiolichens are
known). Lichens are classified as fungi, and their sci-
entific names formally refer to the fungal partner
(mycobiont). The photosynthesizing partner (photo-
biont) can be a green alga, such as Trebouxia or
Trentepohlia,
or 
a 
cyanobacterium 
(“blue-green
alga”), such as Nostoc or Scytonema. The symbiotic
unit has a definite, reproducible form that is different
from the nonlichenized fungus or alga. A few lichens
have two photobionts, and the fungus looks different
where each occurs within the thallus; i.e., it may be
flat where the green alga grows but have dark bumps
where the cyanobacterium occurs, as in Peltigera leu-
cophlebia. The lichen symbiosis thus involves closely
merged members from usually two but sometimes
three biotic kingdoms.
Worldwide in distribution, lichens can be found on
bare soil or sand, grow over mosses and low plants, or
become attached to rocks, trees, or almost any other
substrate. They are good measures of air quality, since
they have great sensitivity to sulfur dioxide (SO2), an
indicator of local pollution and acid rain. In addition,
their tolerance and accumulation of metals, including
heavy metals and radioactive isotopes, are useful indi-
cators of industrial pollution.
Lichens can be classified into several types based
on appearance and structure: Fruticose (shrublike)
lichens, such as British soldiers (Cladonia cristatella)
and common reindeer lichens (Cladina rangiferina),
include species that look like tiny trees or columns but
also include old man’s beard (genus Usnea), which can
dangle from tree branches. Foliose lichens, such as the
puffed shield lichen (Hypogymnia physodes) are flat
and leaflike. Crustose species, such as the map lichen
(Rhizocarpon geographicum), form a “crust” on rocks,
wood, or soils, and are very abundant. Squamulose
lichens, somewhat similar to crusts, are composed of
tiny overlapping or shingle-like flakes; examples are the
primary (basal) thalli of Cladonia, and the oyster lichen
(Hypocenomyce scalaris), which grows on acidic wood.
Umbilicate lichens have leaflike thalli that attach to
rocks at a central point; smooth rock tripe (Umbilicaria
mammulata) is an example. Jelly lichens, such as the
blue jellyskin (Leptogium cyanescens), have a flabby
thallus and a cyanobacterial photobiont, and usually
occur in damp habitats.
Many lichens have a layered internal morphology,
with the bulk of the thallus formed of fungal filaments
and the photobiont often restricted to a distinct layer.
Fungal hyphae are densely arranged in the upper cortex
to exclude other organisms and regulate light intensity
to the green algal cells. These are often located just
below the cortex. Underlying the algae is the medulla,
another layer of much less compact fungal filaments.
204
Lewis acid

Some lichens are held on their substrate by medullary
fungal hyphae, but many foliose lichens have a lower
cortex and special structures called rhizines to hold
them in place on tree bark or rock.
There are only about 100 algal partners, but there
are as many fungal partners as there are lichen species,
which number about 14,000. The fungus receives sug-
ars and other nutrients from the photobiont and pro-
vides a stable and secure structure in which it lives,
provides water, and shields the photobiont from the
sun’s desiccating rays. Lichens reproduce vegetatively in
three basic ways: fragmentation of the thallus, and by
two kinds of tiny vegetative propagules that contain
both partners—soredia, the more common, and isidia,
which are slightly larger and heavier. Isidia and soredia
are dispersed by wind, water, and animal agents.
Lichens are slow growers and are particularly good
pioneer species in disturbed habitats.
Lichens have been used as food, especially by cari-
bou in winter; as medicine and dyes; as dwarf “trees”
in model railroad setups and architectural plans; and in
holiday wreaths and arrangements. And many harsh
landscapes are much enriched by their subtle beauty.

ligament
One component of the musculoskeletal sys-

Ligaments are collagen-rich connective structures, a

bone and to cartilage and that supports organs in place.
ligand
A molecule, ion, hormone, or compound that
binds to a specific receptor site that binds to another
molecule.
The atoms or groups of atoms bound to the CEN-
TRAL ATOM. The root of the word is sometimes con-
verted into the verb to ligate, meaning to coordinate as
a ligand, and the derived participles ligating and ligat-
ed. This use should not be confused with its use to
describe the action of LIGASEs (a class of ENZYMEs).
The names for anionic ligands, whether inorganic or
organic, end in -o. In general, if the anion name ends in
-ide, or -ate, the final -e is replaced by -o, giving -ido,
and -ato, respectively. Neutral and cationic ligand
names are used without modification. Ligands bonded
by a single carbon atom to metals are regarded as radi-
cal substituents, their names being derived from the
parent hydrocarbon, from which one hydrogen atom
has been removed. In general, the final letter -e of the
name is replaced by -yl.
In biochemistry the term ligand has been used
more widely: if it is possible or convenient to regard
part of a polyatomic molecular entity as central, then
the atoms or groups or molecules bound to that part
may be called ligands.

ligand field
Ligand field theory is a modified CRYS-
TAL FIELD theory that assigns certain parameters as
variables rather than taking them as equal to the val-
ues found for free ions, thereby taking into account
the potential covalent character of the metal-LIGAND
bond.
ligand gated ion channel receptor
Ion channels are
specialized pores in the cell membrane that help control
and transfer electrical impulses (action potentials) in
the cell. They regulate the flow of sodium, potassium,
and calcium ions into and out of the cell. The ligand
gated ion channel receptor is a signal receptor protein
in a cell membrane that can act as a channel for the
passage of a specific ion across the membrane. When
activated by a signal molecule, it allows or blocks the
passage of the ion. This results in a change in ion con-
centration that often affects cell functioning.

and links to the two cerebral hemispheres, and is a col-
lective term referring to several brain parts, an inter-
connected neural network or collection of bodies
including the hippocampus, cingulate cortex, and the
amygdala. The limbic structures are important in the
regulation of visceral motor activity and emotional
expression. The amygdala deals with emotion, while
the cingulate cortex plays a role in emotional behavior,
and the hippocampus deals with spatial and memory
functions.
linkage
Refers to the tendency for two genes that
reside next to each other on a chromosome to remain
together, “linked,” during reproduction. The closer
they are to each other, the lower the chance of separa-
tion during DNA replication, and therefore the greater
the chance that they will be inherited with each other.
Linked genes are an exception of Mendel’s laws of
inheritance, specifically the law of independent assort-
ment, which states that pairs of genes segregate inde-
pendently of each other when germ cells are formed.
linkage map
A map that shows the relative positions
of genetic loci on a chromosome, determined by how
often the loci are inherited together. Linked genes are
usually inherited together and are located close to each
other on the chromosome. The distance is measured in
centimorgans (cM). Genes that are located on different
chromosomes follow Mendel’s principle of independent
assortment, while genes that are on the same chromo-
some do not sort independently. The closer the two
genes are to each other on a chromosome, the greater
the chance that they will remain together during meio-
sis instead of crossing over. Researchers can construct a
genetic map showing the relative positions of the genes
on the chromosomes by comparing appearance of a
trait to appearance of marker phenotypes. The distance
between closely spaced genes can be expressed in “map
units” reflecting relative frequency of recombination.
linked genes
Genes that are located close to each
other on the same chromosome and do not show inde-
pendent assortment. This results in parental allele com-
binations 
occurring 
greater 
than 
recombinant
arrangements. A set of closely linked genes that are
inherited together are called a haplotype. Some diseases
are a result of abnormalities in certain gene combina-
tions. X-linked diseases such as hemophilia, color
blindness, and some muscular dystrophies are caused
by genes located on the X chromosome. Sex-linked dis-
eases are caused by a mutant gene on part of the X
chromosome and affects men, since they do not have a
Y chromosome of the XY pair that has a compensating
normal gene.
lipid
A large group of hydrophobic (water insoluble)
molecules that are the building blocks of cell mem-
branes and liposomes (lipid vesicles) and contain fatty
acids; the principal components of fats, oils, waxes,
triglycerides, and cholesterol. They are insoluble in
water but soluble in solvents such as alcohol and ether.
The phospholipid bilayer of the plasma membrane is a
double layer of phospholipid molecules arranged so
that 
the 
hydrophobic 
“tails” 
lie 
between 
the
hydrophilic “heads.” Also known as fat, they easily
store in the body and are an important source of fuel
for the body.

Lipmann, Fritz Albert (1899–1986) German Bio-
chemist
Fritz Albert Lipmann was born on June 12,
1899, in Koenigsberg, Germany, to Leopold Lipmann
and his wife Gertrud Lachmanski.
Between 1917 and 1922 he was educated at the
Universities of Koenigsberg, Berlin, and Munich, where
he studied medicine and received an M.D. degree in
1924 at Berlin. In 1926 he was an assistant in Otto
MEYERHOF’s laboratory at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute,
Berlin, and received a Ph.D. in 1927. He then went
with Meyerhof to Heidelberg to conduct research on
the biochemical reactions occurring in muscle.
In 1930 Lipmann went back to the Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute in Berlin and then to a new institute in
Copenhagen in 1932. Between 1931 and 1932 he
served as a Rockefeller fellow at the Rockefeller Insti-
tute in New York and identified serine phosphate as
the constituent of phosphoproteins that contains the
phosphate.
He went to Copenhagen in 1932 as a research
associate in the Biological Institute of the Carlsberg
Foundation. In 1939 he came to America and became
research associate in the department of biochemistry at
Cornell Medical School, New York, and in 1941
joined the research staff of the Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston, first as a research associate in the
department of surgery, then heading his own group in
the Biochemical Research Laboratory of the hospital.
In 1944 he became an American citizen. In 1949 he
became professor of biological chemistry at Harvard
Medical School, Boston. In 1957 he was appointed a
member and professor of the Rockefeller Institute,
New York.
In 1947 he isolated and named coenzyme A (or
CoA). He later determined the molecular structure
(1953) of this factor that is now known to be bound to
acetic acid as the end product of sugar and fat break-
down in the absence of oxygen. It is one of the most
important substances involved in cellular metabolism,
since it helps in converting amino acids, steroids, fatty
acids, and hemoglobins into energy. For his discovery
of this coenzyme he was awarded the 1953 Nobel Prize
in physiology or medicine. He died on July 24, 1986, in
Poughkeepsie, New York.
lipophilicity
Represents the AFFINITY of a molecule
or a moiety (portion of a molecular structure) for a
lipophilic (fat soluble) environment. It is commonly
measured by its distribution behavior in a biphasic sys-
tem, either liquid-liquid (e.g., partition coefficient in
octan-1-ol/water) or solid-liquid (retention on reversed-
phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-
HPLC) or thin-layer chromatography (TLC) system).
See also HYDROPHOBICITY.
lipoprotein
Since lipids are hydrophobic (water
insoluble), certain lipids like cholesterol and triglyc-
erides are coated or bonded with a protein so they can
be carried in the blood. Since it is not possible to deter-
mine the exact lipoprotein content in blood due to the
variety of lipoproteins, the medical profession talks
about low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and high-density
lipoproteins (HDLs) that transport fats and cholesterol
through the blood.
lipoxygenase
A nonheme iron ENZYME that cat-
alyzes the INSERTION of O2 into polyunsaturated fatty
acids to form hydroperoxy derivatives.
lithosphere
The solid inorganic uppermost portion
or mantle of the Earth that includes the surface land
and that of the ocean basin and is about 60 miles thick.
littoral zone
The shallow shoreward region of a
freshwater body, just beyond the breaker zone, and
where light penetrates to the bottom sediments, giv-
ing rise to a zone that is colonized by rooted plants
called helophytes; a region of a lake or pond where
the water is less than 6 meters deep; in oceanography,
the line extending from the high water line to about
200 meters; also called the intertidal zone where sub-
mersion of tides is a normal event. The near-surface
open water surrounded by the littoral zone is the lim-
netic zone, which gets ample light and is dominated
by plankton. The littoral system is divided into a
eulittoral (lower, middle, and upper) and a sublittoral
(or subtidal, or supratidal) zone, the zone exposed to
air only at its upper limit by the lowest spring tides.
They are separated at a depth of about 50 meters.
The term is also frequently used interchangeably with
intertidal zone.

liverwort
A green photosynthetic bryophyte belong-
ing to the family Hepaticae (division Hepatophyta). A
small, simple plant that lives in moist, shady areas with
wide, flat leaves that lie close to the ground. Liverworts
reproduce with spores and have one of two forms: thal-
loid liverworts (Marchantiidae) and leafy liverworts
(Jungermanniidae). Liverworts have no roots, but have
thin (one-cell thick) rootlike structures known as rhi-
zoids that serve for attachment and water absorption.
Liverworts comprise two separate generations: the
gametophyte generation and the sporophyte genera-
tion. There are around 6,000 species of liverworts
worldwide, with some 4,000 species belonging to the
Jungermanniales.
lizards
Lizards are vertebrates that belong to the
class Reptilia, which contains some 27 families. Lizards
and snakes are scaled reptiles. Lizards were first found
in the Jurassic period about 213 million years ago.
There are about 3,500 species of lizards worldwide liv-
ing in warm tropics and subtropical climates, as well as
in temperate regions, and they can be as large as the
10-foot Kimodo dragon. They have long bodies, typi-
cally with four legs and a tail, have movable eyelids,
and external ear openings. They can lose a tail and
regenerate a new one. Lizards may be the most success-
ful reptiles living today.
locus
The specific position or location on a chromo-
some that is occupied by a gene. The plural form is loci.
Loewi, Otto (1873–1961) Austrian Physician, Phar-
macologist
Otto Loewi was born on June 3, 1873, in
Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, to Jacob Loewi, a mer-
chant, and Anna Willstätter. He attended the humanis-
tic gymnasium (grammar school) locally from 1881 to
1890 and entered the Universities of Munich and
Strassburg as a medical student in 1891. In 1896 he
received a doctor’s degree at Strassburg University.
After spending a few months working in the bio-
chemical institute of Franz Hofmeister in Strassburg,
he became an assistant to Carl von Noorden, clinician
at the city hospital in Frankfurt during 1897–98. In
1898 he became an assistant of Professor Hans Horst
Meyer, a renowned pharmacologist at the University of
Marburg-an-der-Lahn and a professor of pharmacolo-
gy in Vienna. In 1905 Loewi became associate profes-
sor at Meyer’s laboratory, and in 1909 he was
appointed to the chair of pharmacology in Graz. In
1940 he moved to the United States and became
research professor at the School of Medicine of New
York University, New York City, where he remained
until his death.
His neurological researches during the period
1921–26 provided the first proof that chemicals were
involved in the transmission of impulses from one
nerve cell to another and from neuron to the responsive
organ. It was for his discovery of the chemical trans-
mission of nerve impulses that he received the Nobel
Prize in physiology or medicine in 1936, jointly with
Sir Henry DALE. Loewi spent his years investigating the
physiology and pharmacology of metabolism, the kid-
neys, the heart, and the nervous system. He became an
American citizen in 1946 and died on December 25,
1961.
logistic growth
A
model developed by Belgian
mathematician Pierre Verhulst (1838) that states that
the growth rate is dependent on population density and
restricted by carrying capacity. Growth is represented
by an S-curve, and the growth rate declines as the pop-
ulation increases. The pattern of growth is a slow start,
an explosive middle growth period, and then a flatten-
ing of the curve as growth slows.

long-day plant
A plant affected by photoperiodism.
A plant that needs more light than dark for flowering.
Long-day plants are spinach, lettuce, and wheat. Others
such as calceolaria, philodendron, and tuberous bego-
nias need 14 to 18 hours of light for flowering. Long-
day plants form flowers during day lengths of more than
12 hours and are both indoor and outdoor plant types.
See also PHOTOPERIODISM.
longevity
The act of living for a long period of time.
loop of Henle
One of the six structural and function-
al parts of the kidney’s nephron, along with Bowman’s
capsule, glomerulus, proximal convoluted tubule, distal
convoluted tubule, and collecting tubule. The long hair-
pin turn, or loop of Henle, extends through the medulla
from the end of the proximal convoluted tubule to the
start of the distal convoluted tubule. It has a descending
limb called the proxima straight tubule that reabsorbs
water, and an ascending limb that reabsorbs NaCl, end-
ing with the distal straight tubule. It is the major site of
water and salt reabsorption. Some parts of it are perme-
able to water and impermeable to materials such as salt
or ammonia in the urine, and vice versa. Also called the
ansa nephroni.
low-spin
In any COORDINATION entity with a particu-
lar dn (1 < n < 9) configuration and a particular geome-
try, if the n electrons are distributed so that they occupy
the lowest possible energy levels, the entity is a low-spin
complex. If some of the higher-energy d orbitals are
occupied before all the lower-energy ones are complete-
ly filled, then the entity is a high-spin complex.
luminescent
The act of emitting light without caus-
ing heat (called cold light). Bioluminescence is the act
of producing light by biological organisms, e.g., firefly;
luminescent bacteria (Photobacterium phosphoreum);
and fox fire
in the form of Clitocybeilludens
(Omphalotus olerius), Panellus stypticus, and Armillar-
ia mellea. The lanthanides are a special group of ele-
ments (elements cerium [Ce, atomic no. 58] through
lutetium [Lu, atomic no. 71] within the periodic table
that have trivalent cations that emit light. When these
elements are absorbed into materials, the materials can
become luminescent after being excited by an electrical
current (electroluminescence) or by absorbing light
(photoluminescence). As the ions relax to their ground
state, they release light.
lumper
A taxonomist who prefers to classify organ-
isms into relatively small groups, emphasizing similari-
ties. Opposite of a splitter.
See also SPLITTER.
lung
The basic respiratory organ of air-breathing 
vertebrates. The basic function of the respiratory sys-
tem is for lungs to supply oxygen to tissues and remove
excess carbon dioxide from the blood. This is accom-
plished by inspiration, the movement of air into the
lungs, and expiration, movement out of the lungs.
Exchange of gases occurs at the internal surface of the
lungs by diffusing oxygen from the lungs into the
lung
209

lungs. The trachea (windpipe, top center) divides into two
bronchi, which divide further into small bronchioles. The bronchi-
oles terminate in alveoli (not seen), grapelike clusters of air sacs
surrounded by blood vessels. Here the blood takes up oxygen and
releases carbon dioxide to be exhaled. (Courtesy © Alfred
Pasieka/Photo Researchers, Inc.)

blood, while carbon dioxide (CO2) diffuses from the
blood into the lungs. Gas is transported in the blood,
and the circulatory system distributes oxygen through-
out the body while collecting CO2 for return to the
lungs. Ventilation, or airflow to the lungs, and perfu-
sion, blood flow through lung capillaries, are the main
factors that determine the overall pulmonary function.
The ventilation/ perfusion ratio needs to be fairly con-
stant in all parts of the lung for the most effective
transfer of respiratory gases.
Lungs are saclike structures of varying complexity,
depending on the organism. They are connected to the
outside by a series of tubes and a small opening. In
humans, the lungs can be found in the thoracic cavity
and consist of the internal airways; the alveoli, tiny,
thin-walled, inflatable sacs where oxygen and carbon
dioxide are exchanged; the pulmonary circulatory ves-
sels; and elastic connective tissues. The exchange of
gases in the lungs takes place by breathing, chest move-
ments that inhale air and exhale or force gases such as
carbon dioxide out.
lyase
An ENZYME of EC class 4 that catalyzes the
separation of a bond in a SUBSTRATE molecule.
See also EC NOMENCLATURE FOR ENZYMES.
lymph
A clear, colorless, watery fluid that contains
white blood cells and antibodies. Lymph bathes the tis-
sues, passes through lymph-node filters and returns to
the blood stream. The lymphatic system is a system of
vessels and lymph nodes that returns fluid and protein
to the blood, and it is separate from but parallel to the
circulatory system. Lymph flows through lymph nodes
and is transformed into lymphocytes, a special kind of
white blood cell that helps create the immune system
and comprises up to 50 percent of all white blood cells.
lymphocyte
A white blood cell that identifies foreign
objects such as bacteria and viruses in the body and pro-
duces antibodies and cells that target them. There are
different types of lymphocytes, the most important of
which are: B cells that produce specific antibodies to
destroy foreign objects; T cells that attack cells that are
infected by viruses, cancer cells, and other foreign tissue;
NK (natural killer) cells that kill cancer cells and cells
infected by viruses through phagocytosis; and null cells,
also NK-type cells that attack certain targets. These cells
occupy less than 1 percent in circulating blood as they
travel from the blood to the lymph and lymph nodes and
back into the circulating blood. Other types of lympho-
cytes include acidophilic or eosinophilic, agranular, non-
granular or lymphoid, basophilic, granular, heterophilic,
neutrophilic, polymorphonuclear, and activated.
lysis
Biological term for destruction or killing, as in
bacteriolysis or the rupturing of a cell membrane with
resulting loss of cytoplasm.
lysogenic cycle
A stage in viral development when a
virus inserts its genome in a host genome and lies dor-
mant until outside factors initiate the new genetic mate-
rial to be transcribed. It then goes into a lytic cycle, a
massive replication of new viruses, and lyses (destroys
the cell membrane) the host cell.
lysosome
A small organelle found in eukaryotic cells
that is surrounded by a membrane and contains diges-
tive hydrolytic enzymes and chemicals that are strongly
acidic. Lysosomes fuse with the vascular membrane,
grab the food, and digest it, breaking it down into
usable parts. Lysosomes also work with leukocytes by
digesting leukocytes that have engulfed foreign objects
or cleaned up damaged cells.
lysozyme
A basic enzyme or antibacterial product
that can be found in tears, saliva, perspiration, the
nasal cavity, egg whites, animal fluids, and some plant
tissues. It attacks the cells walls of gram-positive bacte-
ria by cleaving the muramic acid [beta(1-4)-N-acetyl-
glucosamine] linkage in the cell walls of this class of
bacteria.
lytic cycle
The viral replication that releases new
phages (particles) through the lysis of the host cell.
See also LYSOGENIC CYCLE.
lytic virus
A virus that causes lysis of the host cell.

Macleod, John James Richard (1876–1935) Scot-
tish Physiologist
John James Richard Macleod was
born on September 6, 1876, in Cluny, near Dunkeld,
Perthshire, Scotland, to the Rev. Robert Macleod.
Macleod went to the grammar school at Aberdeen and
later entered the Marischal College of the University of
Aberdeen to study medicine. In 1898 he worked for a
year at the Institute for Physiology at the University of
Leipzig, and the following year he was appointed
demonstrator of physiology at the London Hospital
Medical School.
In 1903 he was appointed professor of physiology
at the Western Reserve University at Cleveland, Ohio,
in the United States. In 1918 he became professor of
physiology at the University of Toronto, Canada, and
served as director of the physiological laboratory and
as an associate dean of the faculty of medicine. In 1928
he was appointed Regius professor of physiology at the
University of Aberdeen, a position he held until his
death.
For his work on the discovery of insulin with Fred-
erick BANTING, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in
physiology or medicine for 1923.
Macleod conducted research in carbohydrate
metabolism, focusing especially on diabetes, and pub-
lished some 37 papers on carbohydrate metabolism
and 12 papers on experimentally produced glycosuria
(sugar in the urine).
He wrote 11 books and monographs, including
Recent Advances in Physiology (with Sir Leonard Hill)
(1905); Physiology and Biochemistry of Modern
Medicine; 
Diabetes: 
Its 
Pathological 
Physiology
(1925); Carbohydrate Metabolism and Insulin (1926);
and the Vanuxem lectures, published in 1928 as the
Fuel of Life. He died on March 16, 1935.
macroevolution
Evolution that deals with large-
scale and complex changes such as the rise of species,
mass extinctions, and evolutionary trends.
macromolecule
A large molecule of high molecular
mass composed of more than 100 repeated monomers,
single chemical units of lower relative mass; a polymer.
DNA, proteins, and polysaccharides are examples of
macromolecules in living systems; a large complex
molecule formed from many simpler molecules.
macrophages
Blood cells that are able to ingest a
wide variety of particulate materials. They are a type of
PHAGOCYTE.
magnetic circular dichroism (MCD)
A measure-
ment of CIRCULAR DICHROISM of a material that is
induced by a magnetic field applied parallel to the
direction of the measuring light beam. Materials that
are achiral still exhibit MCD (the Faraday effect),
since the magnetic field leads to the lifting of the
degeneracy of electronic orbital and spin states and to
211
M

the mixing of electronic states. MCD is frequently
used in combination with absorption and CD studies
to affect electronic assignments. The three contribu-
tions to the MCD spectrum are the A-term, due to
Zeeman splitting of the ground and/or excited degen-
erate states; the B-term, due to field-induced mixing of
states; and the C-term, due to a change in the popula-
tion of molecules over the Zeeman sublevels of a
paramagnetic ground state. The C-term is observed
only for molecules with ground-state paramagnetism,
and becomes intense at low temperatures; its variation
with field and temperature can be analyzed to provide
magnetic parameters of the ground state, such as spin,
g-factor, and zero-field splitting. Variable-temperature
MCD is particularly effective in identifying and
assigning electronic transitions originating from para-
magnetic CHROMOPHOREs.
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
The visualiza-
tion of the distribution of nuclear spins (usually water)
in a body by using a magnetic field gradient (NMR
IMAGING). A similar technique, but less widely used, is
to visualize the distribution of paramagnetic centers
(EPR imaging).
magnetic susceptibility
For paramagnetic materials,
the magnetic susceptibility can be measured experimen-
tally and used to give information on the molecular
magnetic dipole moment, and hence on the electronic
structure of the molecules in the material. The para-
magnetic contribution to the molar magnetic suscepti-
bility of a material, χ, is related to the molecular
magnetic dipole moment m by the Curie relation: χ =
constant m2/T.
magnetotactic
Ability to orient in a magnetic field.
major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
A large
cluster of genes on chromosome 6 in humans, encoding
cell-surface proteins that play several roles in the
immune system. Several classes of protein such as
MHC class I and II proteins are encoded in this region.
In humans, these are known as human leukocyte anti-
gens (HLA). Class I protein molecules are designated
HLA A, B, or C. Class II molecules are designated DP,
DQ, or DR.
• MHC class I molecule. A molecule encoded to genes
of the MHC that participates in antigen presentation
to cytotoxic T (CD8+) cells.
• MHC class II molecule. A molecule encoded by genes
of the MHC that participates in antigen presentation
to helper T (CD4+) cells.
The ability of T lymphocytes to respond only when
they “see” the appropriate antigen in association with
“self” MHC class I or class II proteins on the antigen-
presenting cells is called MHC restriction.
malaria
A tropical disease caused by a protozoa of
the genus Plasmodium (Plasmodium falciparum) and
transmitted to humans by the bite of mosquitoes of the
genus Anopheles.
malignant
Term used to designate a cancerous 
condition.
See also CANCER.
Mallophaga
One of the insect orders, known as
chewing lice, with three families, Menoponidae,
Philopteridae, and Trichodectidae, and made up of the
chewing lice, characterized by flattened, wingless bod-
ies, chewing mouthparts, and gradual metamorphosis.
Commonly found on dogs and cats.
Malpighian tubule
An excretory organ in arthro-
pods (insects) that correspond functionally to the kid-
neys of vertebrates. The tubules maintain internal salt
and water balance and remove wastes such as urea;
uric acid; urates of sodium, calcium, and ammonia;
leucin; and various salts of calcium and potassium
(oxalates, carbonates, and phosphates). Most of the
nitrogen excreted is in the form of uric acid. Opens
into the posterior section of the alimentary canal (gut).
In some insects, such as Mermeleon formicarius,
Chrysopa perla, and Euplectrus bicolor, the Malpighi-
an tubules produce a substance just before the time of
pupation that is spun out of the anus in the form of silk
threads, with which the cocoon is woven.

Mammalia
A class of warm-blooded animals that
have three characteristics not shared by other animals:
body hair; the production of milk for nourishment of
their infants by mammary glands (teats), which are
modified sweat glands; and the three middle ear bones
(malleus, incus, and stapes). Placental mammals have a
vascular-connected placenta formed between the
embryo and mother (e.g., humans, bears, whales).
Aplacental mammals do not (e.g., marsupials and
monotremes). Most mammals also have differentiated
teeth. Found on land and sea, there are around 5,000
species placed in 26 orders.
mange
A partial or complete lack or removal of hair
resulting from various disorders or conditions. Also a
form of dermatitis caused by species of mites (for
example, Sarcoptes scabiei causes sarcoptic mange or
scabies). Also called alopecia.
mantle
A membranous or muscular outer form of
tissue that surrounds the visceral mass in a mollusk and
secretes the shell and periostracum, the outermost layer
of shell that provides protection.
marine
Refers to sediments or environments in seas
or ocean waters.
marsupial
An aplacental mammal whose young are
born undeveloped and complete their embryonic devel-
opment not inside the body of the mother but, rather,
inside a maternal pouch called a marupium, located on
the outside of the body, in which the young attach to
the mother’s nipples. Kangaroos, wombats, bandicoots,
opossums, and Koala bears are examples. Found only
in Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and a few nearby
islands, except for the opossum, which is the only
North American marsupial.
Mastigophora
A phylum composed of the most
primitive type of protozoans. Usually parasitic, they
have many flagella for movement, and some can form
pseudopodia, used for food engulfing or movement,
called flagellates. They live inside host organisms to
obtain nutrients and cause diseases such as trichomoni-
asis, giardiasis, trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis.
matrilineal
Societies in which descent is traced
through mothers rather than through fathers. Property
is often passed from mothers to daughters, and the cus-
tom of matrilocal residence may be encouraged. Many
Native American nations are matrilineal.
matrix
Often described as a scaffolding, support, or
cell growth director (intercellular); it is a complex net-
work of nonliving fibrous material of the connective
tissues that acts as structural support. Examples
include the skin, cartilage, bone, tendon, and muscle.
matter
Any substance that has inertia and occupies
physical space; can exist as solid, liquid, gas, plasma,
foam, or Bose–Einstein condensate.
mean
A statistical method used to indicate a point
on the scale of measures where the population is cen-
tered. The mean is the average of the scores in a popu-
lation.
mechanoreceptor
A
specialized sensory
receptor
that responds to mechanical stimuli, e.g., tension, pres-
sure, or displacement. Examples include the inner-ear
hair cells, carotid sinus receptors, and muscle spindles.
Mechnikov, Ilya Ilyich (1845–1916) Russian Zool-
ogist
Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov was born on May 16,
1845, in a village near Kharkoff in Russia to an officer
of the Imperial Guard, who was a landowner in the
Ukraine steppes.
Mechnikov went to school at Kharkoff and was
interested in natural history. He attended the University
of Kharkoff to study natural sciences. After graduating
at Kharkoff, he went to study marine fauna at
Heligoland, and then to the University of Giessen, the
University of Göttingen, and the Munich Academy. In
1865, while he was at Giessen, he discovered intracel-
lular digestion in one of the flatworms. At Naples he
Mechnikov, Ilya Ilyich
213

prepared a thesis for his doctorate on the embryonic
development of the cuttle-fish Sepiola and the crus-
tacean Nelalia.
In 1882, in a private laboratory he set up, he dis-
covered the phenomenon of phagocytosis. In 1888 he
went to Paris, where Louis Pasteur gave him a labora-
tory and an appointment in the Pasteur Institute, where
he remained for the rest of his life.
Apart from his work on phagocytosis, Mechnikov
published many papers on the embryology of inverte-
brates. These included work on the embryology of
insects, published in 1866, and, in 1886, his studies of
the embryology of medusae. At the Pasteur Institute in
Paris, Mechnikov was engaged in work associated
with the establishment of his theory of cellular immu-
nity. He published several papers and two volumes on
the comparative pathology of inflammation (1892),
and in 1901 he published a treatise entitled L’Immu-
nité dans les Maladies Infectieuses (Immunity in infec-
tious diseases). In 1908 he was awarded, together with
Paul EHRLICH, the Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine.
He later proved that syphilis can be transmitted
to monkeys and took up the study of the flora (lactic-
acid-producing bacteria) of the human intestine 
and developed a theory that senility is due to poison-
ing of the body by the products of certain of these
bacteria.
Mechnikov received many distinctions, among
which were the honorary D.Sc. of the University of
Cambridge, the Copley Medal of the Royal Society 
of which he was a foreign member, the honorary
memberships of the Academy of Medicine in Paris
and the Academies of Sciences and of Medicine in St.
Petersburg. In addition, he was a corresponding
member of several other societies and a foreign mem-
ber of the Swedish Medical Society. He died on July
16, 1916.
mediator modulator (immune modulator; messenger)
An object or substance by which something is mediat-
ed, such as:
• A structure of the nervous system that transmits
impulses eliciting a specific response.
• A chemical substance (transmitter substance) that
induces activity in an excitable tissue, such as nerve
or muscle (e.g., hormones).
• A substance released from cells as the result of an
antigen-antibody interaction or by the action of anti-
gen with a sensitized lymphocyte (e.g., cytokine).
Concerning mediators of immediate hypersensitivi-
ty, the most important include histamine, leukotriene
(e.g., SRS-A), ECF-A, PAF, and serotonin. There also
exist three classes of lipid mediators that are synthe-
sized by activated mast cells through reactions initiated
by the actions of phospholipase A2. These are
prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating
factors (PAF).
medicinal chemistry
A chemistry-based discipline,
also involving aspects of biological, medical, and phar-
maceutical sciences. It is concerned with the invention,
discovery, design, identification, and preparation of
biologically active compounds; the study of their
METABOLISM; the interpretation of their mode of action
at the molecular level; and the construction of STRUC-
TURE-ACTIVITY RELATIONSHIPS.

One part of the brain stem,
along with the midbrain, pons, and reticular formation;
connects the brain to the spinal cord through the fora-
men magnum. Nerve tissue that deals with vital func-
tions in respiration, circulation (heart rate, blood flow),
and vasomotor; controls reflexes such as coughing,
sneezing, swallowing, vomiting, and gagging.
medusa
One of two basic life cycles of Cnidaria (i.e.,
hydra, jellyfish, anemones, and corals), the other being
polyps. The medusa form is a free-swimming, floating,
umbrellalike, flat, mouth-down version. Polyps’ forms
are sessile. Body parts on both forms are similar. Most
medusa have separate sexes. The eggs are fertilized
after they are shed into the water and usually grow into
polyp form that, in a form of asexual reproduction,
may break into multiple medusas.
megapascal (MPa)
A unit of pressure. 1 MPa =
1,000,000 Pa (pascal). 1 megapascal (MPa) = 10 bars.
A value of 1 bar is approximately equal to one atmo-
sphere of pressure.

meiosis
The reductive division of diploid cells in
ovaries and testes that produce gametes (sperm and
ova). Two divisions with several stages take place that
result in the production of four daughter cells, each of
which contain half (haploid) of the original number of
chromosomes.

negative ions on the other; potential inside a membrane
minus the potential outside. A typical membrane poten-
tial is –60 mV, where the inside is negative relative to
the surrounding fluid, and resting membrane potentials
are typically found between –40 and –100 mV.
memory cell
Cells (lymphocytes) that have been
exposed to specific antigens and remain in the body
after an immune response to attack those same antigens
if reexposed to them in the future. Memory cells are
subsets of T and B cells.
Mendel, Gregor Johann Mendel (1822–84) was an
Austrian botanist and monk who was the first to lay
the groundwork for the foundation of the science of
genetics, using his now famous experiments with
breeding peas at his monastery. His groundbreaking
research paper “Experiments in Plant Hybridization,”
was read at a meeting on February 8, 1865. He 
concluded that genes were not blends of parental
traits, but instead were separate physical entities
passed individually in specific proportions from one
generation to the next.
Menkes’ disease
A sex-linked inherited disorder,
causing defective gastrointestinal absorption of copper
and resulting in copper deficiency early in infancy.
menstrual cycle
The cyclical growth and destruction
of the female endometrium each month; a stage of the
female reproductive cycle. As an egg matures and is
released monthly, hormones such as estrogen stimulate
the thickening of the endometrium. Progesterone stops
the growth of the endometrium and prepares the body
for pregnancy. If it does not occur, the endometrium
becomes a bloody discharge through the cervix into the
vagina, thus ending the menstrual period.
See also ESTROUS CYCLE.
meristem
A group of plant cells that can divide
indefinitely and can provide new cells for the plant as
long as it lives.
meroblastic cleavage (incomplete cleavage)
A type
of cleavage where only part of the fertilized egg, the
blastodisc, goes through division, usually leaving a
large concentration of yolk in the egg; observed in
avian development.
mesentery
A membrane fold (peritoneum) suspend-
ing, attaching, and anchoring various organs to the
body cavity, such as the small intestine and spleen;
provides blood, lymphatic vessels, and nerve supply to
and from the organs. The term mesentery is used
generically describing peritoneal extensions not only
from the intestine but from all abdominal and pelvic
organs.
mesoderm
The middle (mesos) of three germ layers
(endo- and ectoderms are the other two) of the early
embryo during gastrulation, early mammalian embry-
onic development, that gives rise to blood, cartilage,
circulatory system, connective tissue, gonads, kidneys,
and muscle. Three regions of the mesoderm are respon-
sible for specific parts: the epimere or dorsal mesoderm
forms somites, discrete clumps of mesoderm, which
forms the connective tissue layer of the skin, most of
the bony skeleton, and most of the striated musculature
(each somite is further split into dermotome, myotome,
and sclerotome segments); the mesomere or intermedi-
ate mesoderm, which differentiate into the kidney and

vessels, and mesenteries.
mesophyll
Plant tissue that forms the inner or mid-
dle cells of the leaf and lies between the upper and
lower epidermis. It contains two types of chlorenchyma
cells (cells that contain chlorophyll): the long and verti-
cally arranged palisade cells, the upper layer, which are
on top of the round and loosely packed spongy cells in
the lower layer, where most of the gas exchange occurs
and where photosystem II is most active. It is in both
the palisade and spongy cells that photosynthesis takes
place by way of chloroplasts.
mesotrophic lake
Any lake with a moderate nutri-
ent supply.
Mesozoic era
A geological time that extends from
the end of the Paleozoic era (230 million years ago) to
the beginning of the Cenozoic era (about 65 million
years ago). Subdivided into the Triassic, Jurassic, and
Cretaceous periods, which includes the age of the
dinosaurs.
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
messenger RNA (mRNA)
An RNA molecule that
transfers the coding information for protein synthesis
from the chromosomes to the ribosomes. Fragments of
ribonucleic acid serve as templates for protein 
synthesis by carrying genetic information from a strand
of DNA to ribosomes for translation into a protein.
The information from a particular gene or group of
genes is transferred from a strand of DNA by con-
structing a complementary strand of RNA through
transcription. Transfer RNA (tRNA), composed of
three nucleotide segments attached to specific amino
acids, correctly match with a template strand of
mRNA, lining up the correct order of amino acids and
bonding them, via translation in the ribosome with
rRNA (ribosomal RNA), to form a protein.

A qualifying prefix indicating the oxidized form
of the parent protein, e.g., methemoglobin.
metabolism
The entire physical and chemical pro-
cesses involved in the maintenance and reproduction of
life in which nutrients are broken down to generate
energy and to give simpler molecules (CATABOLISM),
which by themselves may be used to form more com-
plex molecules (ANABOLISM).
In the case of heterotrophic organisms, the energy
evolving from catabolic processes is made available for
use by the organism.
In medicinal chemistry, the term metabolism refers
to the biotransformation of xenobiotics and particular-
ly DRUGs.
See also BIOTRANSFORMATION; XENOBIOTIC.
metabolite
Any intermediate or product resulting
from METABOLISM.
metalloenzyme

in 
which 
ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY recognition is used, with attach-
ment of a metal ion or metal complex to the antibody.
The specific absorption or (radioactive) emission of the
metal is then used as a probe for the location of the
recognition sites.
See also IMAGING; RADIONUCLIDE.
metallothionein
A small, cysteine-rich protein that
binds heavy metal ions, such as zinc, cadmium, and
copper in the form of CLUSTERs.

Meyerhof, Otto Fritz (1884–1951) German Physiol-
ogist, Chemist
Otto Fritz Meyerhof was born on April
12, 1884, in Hannover to Felix Meyerhof, a merchant,
and Bettina May. He went to the Wilhelms Gymnasium
(classical secondary school) in Berlin, leaving at age 14
only to have kidney problems two years later, which
kept him confined for a long period. He eventually stud-
ied medicine at Freiburg, Berlin, Strassburg, and Heidel-
berg and graduated in 1909. From 1912 he worked at
the University of Kiel, becoming a professor in 1918.
Meyerhof conducted experiments on the energy
changes in cellular respiration. For his discovery of the
fixed relationship between the consumption of oxygen
and the metabolism of lactic acid in the muscle, he was
awarded, together with the English physiologist A.V.
HILL, the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in
1922. In 1925 Meyerhof successfully extracted the
enzymes that convert glycogen to lactic acid from the
muscle. He introduced the term glycolysis to describe
the anaerobic degradation of glycogen to lactic acid,
and showed the cyclic nature of energy transformations
in living cells. This metabolic pathway of glycolysis—
conversion of glucose to lactic acid—is now known as
the Embden-Meyerhof pathway, after Meyerhof and
Gustav George Embden.
During World War II, he went to the United States
and became research professor of physiological chem-
istry, a position created for him by the University of
Pennsylvania and the Rockefeller Foundation. He died
from a heart attack on October 6, 1951.
Michaelis-Menten kinetics
The dependence of the
initial rate of conversion of a SUBSTRATE (S) of the
product (P) by an ENZYME or other catalyst (E). 
The simplest mechanism:
yields, under initial STEADY STATE conditions, and [P] =
0, the Michaelis-Menten equation,
ν = ——————
where ν is the rate of conversion (Ms –1), V = k2[E] is
the maximum rate at [S] = ∞
for a particular
enzyme/catalyst concentration, k2 is the turnover num-
ber (s –1), and Km = (k–1 + k2)/k1 is the Michaelis con-
stant under the conditions used. In the case of an
impure enzyme or catalyst, [E] is given as gl –1 instead
of M. This equation leads to a hyperbolic dependence
of ν upon [S], which is frequently observed in practice
even when [S] is not in great excess over [E].
microevolution
The smallest scale of evolution;
changes within a species; a change in allele or genotype
frequencies over time.
See also MACROEVOLUTION.
microfilament (actin filament)
A minute solid heli-
cal rod—about 7 nm in diameter, composed of the
protein actin found in most eukaryotic cell cyto-
plasm—that makes up part of the cytoskeleton and
often is found in association with microtubules. Plays
a role in cell mobility, cytokinesis, and, with myosin,
part of the contractile mechanism of skeletal muscle.
One of three protein filaments of the cytoskeleton,
along with microtubules and intermediate filaments.
The cytoskeleton provides structural support for the
cell and movement of organelles, chromosomes, as
well as the cell itself.
micronutrient
A compound essential for cellular
growth, being present in concentrations in minute
amounts in the growth medium.
See also TRACE ELEMENTS.
microtubule
A lengthy hollow cylindrical structure
composed of the protein tubulin. One of three protein
filaments of the cytoskeleton, along with microfila-
ments and intermediate filaments, it is also found in
cilia, flagella, and centrioles. The cytoskeleton provides
structural support for the cell and movement of

organelles, chromosomes, as well as the cell itself.
Microtubules also form the spindle fibers of mitosis.
microvillus
Very small hairlike or fingerlike projec-
tion from the surface of some types of epithelial cells,
particular those in the small intestine, where they serve
to increase surface area.
middle lamella
The gel-like pectin layer between
adjacent plant cell walls that binds or cements the plant
cells together; in woody tissues, lignin replaces pectin.
mimicry
The ability of an individual to look or share
similar traits of an individual of a different species to
protect it from predation. It can be in the form of pro-
tective coloration, imitation of characteristics, or
deception. Two forms of mimicry are common. BATE-
SIAN MIMICRY is where the mimic, which is palatable to
a predator, resembles an unpalatable species; and MÜL-
LERIAN MIMICRY is where two or more unpalatable
species have a reduced predation rate due to their simi-
larity, so that predators avoid them to a greater degree
than they would individually. The viceroy butterfly,
which mimics the monarch, is an example of Batesian
mimicry, while the queen butterfly (Danaus gilippus),
which is a poisonous butterfly, mimics the poisonous
monarch and is an example of Müllerian mimicry.
mineral
A naturally occurring homogeneous solid,
inorganically formed, with a definite chemical composi-
tion, usually crystalline in form, and an ordered atomic
arrangement, e.g., quartz.
mineralocorticoid

bon) corticosteroids, principally aldosterone, that are
predominantly involved in the regulation of electrolyte
and water balance through their effect on ion transport

in epithelial cells of the renal tubules. This results in
retention of sodium and loss of potassium. Some also
possess varying degrees of glucocorticoid activity. Their
secretion is regulated principally by plasma volume,
serum potassium concentration, and angiotensin II and,
to a lesser extent, by anterior pituitary ACTH (adreno-
corticotropic hormone).
minimum dynamic area
The smallest area of habi-
tat necessary to sustain a viable population.
minimum viable population (MVP)
The smallest
isolated population having the best chance of surviving
for x years, regardless of natural catastrophes or future
demographic, environmental, and genetic variables.
Minot, George Richards (1885–1950) American
Pathologist
George Richards Minot was born on
December 2, 1885, in Boston, Massachusetts, to James
Jackson Minot, a physician, and Elizabeth Whitney.
He attended Harvard University and received a B.A.
degree in 1908, an M.D. in 1912, and an honorary
degree of Sc.D. in 1928. In 1915 he was appointed
assistant in medicine at the Harvard Medical School
and the Massachusetts General Hospital. From 1928
to 1948 he was professor of medicine at Harvard and
director of the Thorndike Memorial Laboratory,
Boston City Hospital.
Earlier research revealed that anemia in dogs,
induced by excessive bleeding, is reversed by a diet of
raw liver. In 1926 Minot and William MURPHY found
that ingestion of a half pound of raw liver a day dra-
matically reversed pernicious anemia in human beings.
He received (with George WHIPPLE and William Mur-
phy) the Nobel Prize for physiology or medicine in
1934 for the introduction of a raw-liver diet in the
treatment of pernicious anemia, which up to that time
was almost always a fatal disease. Today, 10,000 lives a
year are saved in the United States alone because of this
discovery.
With chemist Edwin Cohn, they prepared liver
extracts that, when taken orally, constituted the prima-
ry treatment for pernicious anemia until 1948, when
vitamin B was discovered. Minot died on February 25,
1950, in Brookline, Massachusetts.
Miocene
A geological age that extends from the end
of the Oligocene epoch (22.5 million years ago) to the
beginning of the Pliocene epoch (5 million years ago).
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
missense mutation
One of four types of point muta-
tions. A point mutation is when a triplet of three
nucleotides (codon) has the base sequence permanently
changed. A missense mutation is when a change in the
base sequence converts a codon from one amino acid
to a codon for a different amino acid. The other three
point mutations are nonsense (codon for a specific
amino acid is converted to a chain-terminating codon),
silent (converts a codon for an amino acid to another
codon that specifies the same amino acid), and
frameshift (nucleotide is deleted or added to the coding
portion of a gene) mutations.
Mississippian age
The first of the two geologic ages
of the Carboniferous period, extending from about 345
to 310 million years ago. The Pennsylvanian is the sec-
ond (310 to 280 million years ago).
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
mites
Mites and ticks belong to the order Acari and
are the most diverse and abundant of all arachnids.
Very small in size, usually less than a millimeter 
in length, they are ubiquitous, found in almost 
every part of the world, and account for 30,000
species in at least 50 families. Many are parasitic and
cause disease.
mitochondria
Cytoplasmic 
organelles 
of 
most
eukaryotic cells, they are surrounded by a double mem-
brane and produce ADENOSINE 5’-TRIPHOSPHATE as use-
ful energy for the cell by oxidative PHOSPHORYLATION.
The proteins for the ATP-generating electron transport
of the respiration chain are located in the inner mito-
chondrial membrane. Mitochondria contain many
ENZYMEs of the citric acid cycle and for fatty acid ß-
oxidation. They also contain DNA, which encodes
some of their proteins, the remainder being encoded by
nuclear DNA.

mitosis
The cell division process in eukaryotic cells
that replicates chromosomes so that two daughter cells
get equally distributed genetic material from a parent
cell, making them identical to each other and the par-
ent. It is a four-step process that includes prophase
(prometaphase), metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
Interphase is the time in the cell cycle when DNA is
replicated in the nucleus.
See also MEIOSIS.
mixed valency
This is one of several names, such as
“mixed oxidation state” or “nonintegral oxidation
state,” used to describe COORDINATION compounds
and CLUSTERs in which a metal is present in more than
one level of oxidation. The importance in biology is
due to the often-complete delocalization of the valence
electrons over the cluster, allowing efficient electron-
transfer processes.

model
A synthetic COORDINATION entity that closely
approaches the properties of a metal ion in a protein
and yields useful information concerning biological
structure and function. Given the fact that the term is
also loosely used to describe various types of molecular
structures, constructed, for example, in the computer,
the term BIOMIMETIC is more appropriate.

lution. A modern theory about how evolution works at
the level of genes, phenotypes, and populations.
molarity
The number of moles of solute dissolved in
1 liter of solution.
mold
Molds are naturally occurring clusters of
microscopic fungi that reproduce by releasing airborne
spores. Certain individuals with a mold allergy will
develop asthma and nasal symptoms if they breathe in
these spores. Many people are allergic to mold. Mold
spores are carried in the air and can be present all year
long. Mold is most prevalent indoors, in damp loca-
tions and in bathrooms, washrooms, fabrics, rugs,
stuffed animals, books, wallpaper, and other “organic”
materials. Outdoors, mold lives in the soil, on compost,
and on damp vegetation.

many items (such as ions, molecules, etc.) as the num-
ber of atoms in exactly 12 grams of carbon (C). The
number of molecules contained is equal to 6.022 × 1023
(602,200,000,000,000,000,000,000), known as Avo-
gadro’s number. Thus a mole is anything that has Avo-
gadro’s number of items in it.

molecule
The smallest unit in a chemical element or
compound that contains the chemical properties of the
element or compound. They are made of atoms held
together by chemical bonds that form when they share
or exchange electrons. They can vary in complexity
from a simple sharing of two atoms, such as oxygen,
O2, to a more complex substance such as nitroglycerin,
C3H5(NO3)3.

ligands.
molybdopterin
The PROSTHETIC GROUP associated
with the Mo atom of the MOLYBDENUM COFACTOR
found in all molybdenum-containing ENZYMEs except
NITROGENASE. Many of the enzymes catalyze two-
electron redox reactions that involve the net exchange
of an oxygen atom between a SUBSTRATE and water.
The molybdopterin prosthetic group contains a pterin
ring bound to a dithiolene functional group on the 
6-alkyl side chain. In bacterial enzymes a NUCLEOTIDE
is attached to the phosphate group.

Moniz, António Caetano de Abreu Freire Egas
(1874–1955) Portuguese Neuroscientist
António
Caetano de Abreu Freire Egas Moniz was born in
Avanca, Portugal, on November 29, 1874, to Fernando
de Pina Rezende Abreu and Maria do Rosario de
Almeida e Sousa. He received his early education 
from his uncle before joining the Faculty of Medicine
at Coimbra University. He continued his education 
in Bordeaux and Paris, received his doctor’s degree in
medicine in 1899, and became professor at Coimbra in
1902. In 1911 he became the new chair in neurology at
Lisbon and stayed there until his death.
Moniz also participated in politics in 1903, serving
as a deputy in the Portuguese parliament until 1917,
when he became Portuguese ambassador to Spain. In
1917 he was appointed minister for foreign affairs and
was president of the Portuguese delegation at the Paris
Peace Conference in 1918.
Aside from politics, Moniz discovered cerebral
angiography and prefrontal leucotomy (lobotomy). He
was awarded a Nobel Prize in medicine in 1949 for
developing the first psychosurgery procedure, frontal leu-
cotomy, and a surgical interruption of nerve fibers that
connect the frontal or prefrontal areas of the cerebral
cortex of the brain. He published a number of books,
including Physiological and Pathological Aspects of Sex
Life, 1901; Neurology in War, 1917; A Year of Politics,
1920; Diagnostics of Cerebral Tumours and Application
of Arterial Encephalography, 1931; Tentative Methods in
the Treatment of Certain Psychoses, 1936; Prefrontal
Leucotomy: Surgical Treatment of Certain Psychoses,
1937; Clinical Cerebral Angiography, 1938; Cerebral
Arteriography and Phlebography, 1940; On the Side of
Medicine, 1940; How I Came to Perform Leucotomy,
1948; and even History of Playing-Cards, 1942.
Moniz received numerous honors during his career
and is considered the father of modern psychosurgery.
He died on December 13, 1955, in Lisbon.

of antibody that is monogenous, or cells of a single
specificity.
monoclonal antibodies
Laboratory-produced anti-
bodies, which can be programmed to react against a
specific antigen in order to suppress the immune
response.
monocot
Monocotyledonae, a subclass of the
angiosperms, that has as characteristics an embryo
containing one cotyledon, parallel leaf veins, pollen
with single furrow or pore, stem vascular bundles scat-
tered, secondary growth absent, adventitious roots,
and flower parts in multiples of three. Monocots com-
prise some one-quarter of all flowering plants in the
world, about 65,000 species divided among 9 families:
Gramineae, Liliaceae, Iridaceae, Orchidaceae, Palmae,
Pandanaceae, Agavaceae, Bromeliaceae, Musaceae.
Includes lilies, orchids, palms, and grasses. Economi-
cally important monocots such as corn, rice, wheat,
barley, sugar cane, pineapples, dates, and bananas
make up much of the food supply.
Monocots reproduce sexually. The flowering plants
contain female carpels and male stamens. Monocots
are primarily tropical, with the exception of the lilies,
asparagus, and gumflower.

Morgan, 
Thomas 
Hunt (1866–1945) American
Zoologist
Thomas Hunt Morgan was born on Septem-
ber 25, 1866, in Lexington, Kentucky, to Charlton Hunt
Morgan. He received a B.S. at the University of Kentucky
in 1886 and completed postgraduate work at Johns Hop-
kins University, where he studied morphology with W. K.
Brooks and physiology with H. Newell Martin.
In 1890 he obtained a Ph.D. degree at Johns Hop-
kins University for his work on the evolutionary rela-
tionships of pycnogonids (sea spiders).
In 1891 he became associate professor of biology
at Bryn Mawr College for women, Pennsylvania, where
he stayed until 1904, then becoming professor of
experimental zoology at Columbia University, New
York. He remained there until 1928, when he was
appointed professor of biology and director of the G.
Kerckhoff Laboratories at the California Institute of
Technology, at Pasadena. Here he remained until 1945.
During his later years he had his private laboratory at
Corona del Mar, California.
Morgan’s early work on genetic linkage with
Drosophila melanogaster (the fruit fly) was put forward
as a theory of the linear arrangement of the genes in the
chromosomes. He described the phenomena of linkage
and crossing over, which he explained in Mechanism of
Mendelian Heredity (1915). He was the first to show
that variation derives from numerous small mutations.
His work also established the use of drosophila as a
model for genetic research gene-mapping efforts. For his
discoveries concerning the role played by the chromo-
some in heredity, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in
1933. Morgan is considered a cofounder, along with
William Bateson, of modern genetics.
He also wrote several important genetics books:
Heredity and Sex (1913), The Physical Basis of Heredity
(1919), Embryology and Genetics (1924), Evolution and
Genetics (1925), The Theory of the Gene (1926), Exper-
imental Embryology (1927), and The Scientific Basis of
Evolution (1935). He died on December 4, 1945.

humans. The University of Kentucky honored Morgan
by naming its school of biological science after him.

flies that also includes groups such as crane flies,
midges, gnats, and black flies. This is a large, abun-
dant, and well-known family (Culicidae) whose mem-
bers are pests to humans and who, with their long
proboscises for feeding on the blood of mammals, are
vectors for disease. Aedes aegypti (L.) is a vector for

There are upper-motor neurons that lie entirely within
the central nervous system and cause movement
because they terminate on a lower motor neuron; the
lower motor neurons cell body lies in the central ner-
vous system, and their axons leave the central nervous
system through a foramen (hole in a bone for nerves
and blood vessels) and terminate on an effector (e.g.,
muscle).

Silk Degrees: A Tale of Moths and People,
Part Two
By James G. (Spider) Barbour
Recreational domestication of our native moths dates back
to horses and buggies. Several devoted American and
British silk-moth breeders have committed their knowledge
and experience to print. The first popular book devoted to
rearing moths, Caterpillars and Their Moths, was published
in 1902. The authors, two New Englanders named Ida Eliot
and Caroline Soule, gave detailed accounts of raising 43
species of moths, most of them native to the eastern United
States. Among their successes was a cross-pairing with
viable but infertile hybrid offspring between species of two
different genera, the spicebush silk moth (Callosamia
promethea) and the ailanthus silk moth (Samia cynthia).
Intergeneric hybrids are very rare. Even more remarkable,
as mentioned in part one (page 200) in connection with the
French silk promoter Léopold Trouvelot, the ailanthus silk
moth is a native of China. Though others have tried, to this
day this particular feat of old-style genetic engineering has
never been repeated.
A similar book appeared 10 years later by the popular
Indiana novelist Gene Stratton Porter. Moths of the Limber-
lost was a nonfiction companion to her best-known work of
fiction, A Girl of the Limberlost. Illustrated with the author’s
hand-tinted color photographs, this inspired moth tome
launched many a young reader into the throes of moth culti-
vation, so that by the 1940s, standard techniques of silk-
moth culture had been developed and disseminated.
The Amateur Entomologists’ Society, a British organi-
zation, published a compendium of moth-breeding methods
in its sixth volume in 1942, edited by Beowulf Cooper. The
material in this issue of the AES journal was revised and
expanded by W. J. B. Crotch and published as Volume 12, A
Silk Moth Rearer’s Handbook, in 1956.
The first American authors to present these tech-
niques, along with species accounts, were Michael Collins
and Robert Weast in Wild Silk Moths of the United States in
1961. Paul Villiard, a New York moth breeder, published
Moths and How to Rear Them in 1969. Therein he lamented
the policy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture to restrict
importation of nonnative moths, and gave fascinating
accounts of his successes and failures with exotic species.
(By mail from less restricted European breeders, he man-
aged to import living material of many Asian, African, and
tropical American moths.) Attempting to rear the fabulous
Madagascar moon moth (Argema mittrei) from a dozen
eggs he obtained from a British breeder, Villiard offered the
caterpillars every plant he could find. Almost all were
rejected, and the caterpillars died, except for two that
thrived on poison ivy.
In 1996 Cornell University Press published the defini-
tive book (to date) on our native Saturniidae. Authored by
Paul Tuskes, James Tuttle, and Michael Collins, The Wild
Silk Moths of North America presents everything you never
imagined there was to know about these spectacular
insects, including rearing tips, collecting techniques, eco-
logical data, host plants, range maps, emergence times in
different parts of a species’s geographic range, and much
more.
As odd an obsession as it may seem to some, there are
a number of perfectly understandable reasons for breeding
moths. Those assembling collections of pinned insects can
obtain perfect, unblemished specimens freshly hatched
from the cocoon. Researchers can perform a variety of con-
trolled experiments by raising large numbers of caterpillars,
for example, comparing growth rates on different caterpillar
host plants, testing the effects of artificial photoperiods on
caterpillar growth and the length of time spent in the pupal
stage, or recording levels of predation on caterpillars
placed in the open on different plants or in different envi-
ronmental settings.
There is even some profit in rearing large numbers of
caterpillars—selling the cocoons to collectors or the pupae
to research labs for a variety of projects. A recent example
is the splicing of a gene from cecropia onto the genome of a
potato to impart resistance to fungus. Mostly, though, silk
moths are simply fascinating animals in their life habits,
their amazing transformations, their large size, and their
otherworldly beauty.
Raising moths is not an entirely easy business,
though. Obtaining fertile eggs is simple enough, once one
has collected a few cocoons. Chances are, in a batch of
six or more cocoons, at least one will produce a female.
Fresh males and females may mate overnight in an amply
sized screen cage. Lacking males, a female may be teth-
ered on a string tied around the thorax between the
wings, tied in an open-ended screen cylinder for protec-
tion from predators, and left in a tree or shrub overnight.
Very likely in the morning there will be a male mating with
her, the female having emitted her seductive perfume (a
chemical attractant called a pheromone) during the night.
Unlike butterflies, most of which cannot be induced to lay
eggs on anything but fresh leaves of a specific plant
species, silk moths will lay eggs on anything. Most breed-
ers place a fertilized female in a paper shopping bag
(plastic will not do), and the moth will lay eggs on the
sides of the bag. The bag can be cut into pieces with
eggs firmly attached, and placed on appropriate host

plants in places judged to be relatively free of predators
and parasites.
That’s the easy part. Nursing the caterpillars to the
cocoon-spinning stage is the hard part. A saturniid cater-
pillar is a nutrient-rich morsel, full of easily digested calo-
ries, an energy bar for a bird, a mouse, or a wasp; or a
milkshake for a stink bug, which inserts its proboscis
through the caterpillar’s skin, secretes a digestive enzyme,
and sucks out the resultant soup. For a parasitic wasp or
fly, a caterpillar is a living pantry within which its grubs,
after hatching from eggs inserted by the female into its vic-
tim, feed on the abundant food storage cells, avoiding the
internal organs and muscles until the final stage of their
lives, when they reduce the hapless caterpillar to a limp
bag or dry husk before their own transformation to winged
adults. These same natural enemies that reduce a fertile
female’s 200–400 eggs to two surviving adult moths (on
average) are capable of launching assaults on captive
caterpillars as well. Containers may protect caterpillars
from predators, but not from diseases, accidents, and
adverse conditions. Screen-topped containers allow air to
circulate, but this causes leaves placed in the containers
to dry out, so the caterpillars don’t get enough water.
Closed containers have sufficient air for several days at
least, but this lack of ventilation produces condensation,
creating a breeding ground for fungal and bacterial dis-
eases. Open-weave cloth bags (“sleeves” in moth breeder
parlance), placed over tree limbs and tied tight around the
branch at the open end, guarantee fresh food and fresh air
but are subject to attack by birds and wasps, which can
peck or chew holes in the sleeves and consume the help-
less caterpillars in short order.
Beginners can expect to raise at least several
species of silk moth everywhere except in an extremely
cold, polar climate. Caterpillars of many species feed on a
much wider range of plants than those they feed upon in
their native habitats; even some exotic species can be
reared on plant genera common almost everywhere, such
as oak, apple, willow, and privet. Eggs and cocoons are
available in season, for a price, from dealers and amateur
breeders. Start with a web search for “moths + livestock”
or “lepidoptera + livestock.” First, however, you should
learn which species will do well on plants available in
your area and in your local climate. Before your livestock
arrives, be ready with all the rearing gear you will need to
care for your captives.
With some time and effort, trial and error, and poking
around, one should eventually be able to find native silk
moths in wild or weedy areas near home. To the sharp-
eyed, a winter walk may yield cocoons hanging from tree
twigs, spun among the shoots at the bases of maple and
poplar trees, or hidden in tangles of shrubbery. In summer
and fall, one can locate caterpillars by looking for missing
leaves (nibbled down to the stem) on trees and shrubs, or
checking bare ground or pavement under tree branches for
caterpillar droppings (“frass”). Once one has female moths,
either from discovered cocoons or caterpillars or from pur-
chased stock, one can attract local wild males by tethering
the females overnight. It is advisable to purchase a stan-
dard work on moth culture before embarking on such an
adventure.
A patchwork of open and forested land is probably
the best place to look for caterpillars and cocoons, the
more varied the better. Wetlands will have different
species than mature forests, farm hedgerows, weedy lots,
or wind-swept ridges. Silk moths are known to tolerate a
fairly high degree of disturbance and tend to prefer “edge
habitats.” Roadsides, railroad rights-of-way, utility corri-
dors, and even unkempt, weedy corners of industrial yards
are tried and true places for collecting wild silk moths in
all developmental stages. Even cities have scattered,
unmanicured corners where moths eke out a living. The
ailanthus silk moth is one saturniid species that country-
dwelling silk moth enthusiasts must visit a city to find. In
the same urban setting reside several of the native silk
moths, particularly cecropia, polyphemus, and promethea.
During the early 20th century, many authors reported
these species as abundant in eastern and midwestern
cities, the caterpillars and cocoons regularly discovered
by schoolchildren and curious nature lovers on shade
plantings. Toward the end of the century, especially in the
1990s, observers of silk moths reported significant
declines and apparent disappearances of common
species from urban and suburban areas in many areas of
the eastern states. The causes for these declines are
uncertain, but the following factors have been suggested:
increased lighting at night (which may interfere with
reproductive behavior), the release of nonnative parasites
to control gypsy moth and other pests, and general
increased use and accumulation of insecticides and other
toxic chemicals.
Though certain species of silk moths may be common
in settled areas, few ever become sufficiently populous to
be considered pests. Exceptions include the range caterpil-
lar (Hemileuca olivae) in the Plains states, where the cater-
pillars, arrayed with stinging spines, occasionally are so
numerous as to seriously injure the mouths and tongues of
grazing cattle. The cecropia moth has been reported as an

Whether the long-standing association between moths
and humans will continue into the next several centuries is
as uncertain as the future of the human species. People
continue to alter the Earth in ways detrimental to other
species and to ourselves. Very likely the salvation of wild
silk moths lies with that segment of the human population
that cherishes the moths’ existence and keeps the knowl-
edge of their intriguing, mysterious ways.

Muller, Hermann Joseph (1890–1967) American
Geneticist
Hermann Joseph Muller was born in New
York City on December 1, 1890. He attended public
school in Harlem and later Morris High School in the
Bronx. He attended Columbia University in 1907.
He obtained a teaching assistantship in zoology at
Columbia (1912–15) and received a Ph.D. in 1916.
After three years at the Rice Institute, Houston, Texas,
and at Columbia as an instructor, in 1920 Muller
became an associate professor (later professor) at the
University of Texas, Austin, where he remained until
1932. In 1932 he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellow-
ship and for a year worked at Oscar Vogt’s institute in
Berlin and then spent three and a half years as senior
geneticist at the Institute of Genetics of the Academy of
Sciences of the USSR, first in Leningrad and later
(1934–37) in Moscow. He moved to the Institute of
Animal Genetics, University of Edinburgh (1937–40),
and he did both teaching and research at Amherst Col-
lege as a professor from 1942 to 1945. At Amherst he
completed a large-scale experiment showing the rela-
tionship of aging to spontaneous mutations. In 1945 he
accepted a professorship in the zoology department at
Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana, and retired
in 1964.
His method for recognizing spontaneous gene
mutation led to his discovery of a technique for artifi-
cially inducing mutations using X rays, showing in
1927 that mutations could be induced by radiation.
For this discovery, he was awarded the 1946 Nobel
Prize in physiology or medicine.
Muller contributed over 300 articles on biological
subjects to scientific publications. His principal books
are The Mechanism of Mendelian Heredity with T. H.
Morgan, 1915; Out of the Night—a Biologist’s View
of the Future, 1935, 1936, and 1938; and Genetics,
Medicine and Man with C. C. Little and L. H. Snyder,
1947. He also wrote articles on the biological effects
of atomic radiation. He was awarded numerous hon-
orary degrees and other recognitions. During the
1930s and 1940s, his controversial views on eugenics
and unpopular opinions about the hazards of radiation
forced him to leave the United States and to work in
Russia, but he came back. During the late 1940s his
criticisms on nuclear fallout were recognized by his
peers.
He was known as the father of radiation genetics
and died on April 5, 1967, in Indianapolis.
Müller, Paul Hermann (1899–1965) Swiss Chemist
Paul Hermann Müller was born in Olten, Solothurn,
Switzerland, on January 12, 1899. He attended prima-
ry school and the Free Evangelical elementary and sec-
ondary schools. He began working in 1916 as a
laboratory assistant at Dreyfus and Company, followed
by a position as an assistant chemist in the Scientific-
Industrial Laboratory of their electrical plant. He
attended Basel University and received a Ph.D. in 1925.
He became deputy director of scientific research on
substances for plant protection in 1946.
Müller began his career with investigations of dyes
and tanning agents with the J. R. Geigy Company,
Basel (1925–65), and beginning in 1935 concentrated
his research to find an “ideal” insecticide, one that had
rapid, potent toxicity for the greatest number of insect
species, while causing little or no damage to plants and
warm-blooded animals. He tested and concluded that
dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) was the ideal
insecticide.
In 1939 DDT was successfully tested against the
Colorado potato beetle by the Swiss government and
then by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in 1943.
For this discovery of DDT’s potent toxic effects on
insects Müller received the Nobel Prize in physiology
or medicine. DDT proved to be a two-edged sword.
With its chemical derivatives, DDT became the most
widely used insecticide for more than 20 years and was
a major factor in increased world food production and

Egyptian Mummies: 
Brief History and Radiological Studies
By William A. Wagle, M.D.
Egyptians practiced the art of mummification for several
thousand years and produced millions of human mummies.
Mummification began in its most primitive form in the late
fourth millennium B.C.E. (before 3100 B.C.E.) but did not reach
its zenith until around 1000 B.C.E. The underlying goal of
mummification was to preserve the physical form of the
deceased person so that his soul or ba would recognize its
body and be united with it in the hereafter. Mummification
was practiced by various ancient cultures, including the
Incas of South America, but the technique was perfected in
ancient Egypt, where funeral houses dotted the Nile River
from the Mediterranean Sea to the ancient city of Thebes.
The Egyptians believed that after death the body must
be intact and have a proper burial for resurrection. Instead
of cremation, the bodies were prepared to enter the here-
after as “whole” as possible. During the early dynasties,
mummification was a burial form reserved for kings, but by
1000 B.C.E. the practice had become widespread. The
pharaohs had the most elaborate burials because it was
believed that they became gods after death. High-ranking
officials, priests, nobles, and wealthy individuals also
underwent mummification.
Mummification was not practiced in prehistoric times,
when the dead were simply buried in desert pits. The Egyp-
tians realized that bodies were preserved naturally in the
dry, hot sands of the Egyptian desert. The remains of buried
individuals were recognizable many years later. According
to renowned Egyptologist Bob Brier, “The Egyptians started
burying their dead in chambers cut into moist bedrock
beneath the sand in order to protect the bodies from rob-
bers or from being uncovered by the shifting desert sands.
Without contact with the dehydrating hot sands, they were
subject to decay. This probably gave the Egyptians the
impetus to invent mummification.”
While Egyptians left very little in written documents
about the process of mummification, Egyptologists have
been able to unlock many of its mysteries with detailed
analysis of human mummies. The best ancient source of
information on the details of this embalming technique
comes from Herodotus, a Greek historian who visited Egypt
around 500 B.C.E. He left an account of mummification in a
publication called The History II.
According to this account, the first step of mummifica-
tion was the removal of the brain, which the Egyptians felt
had no value. This was achieved with a curved metal hook,
which was inserted through the nose. The metal could easi-
ly fracture the thin ethmoid bone and enter the skull. The
curved hook was twisted repeatedly to macerate the brain,
which was removed piecemeal through the nose.
According to Herodotus, “The skull is cleared of the
rest by rinsing with drugs; next they make a cut along the
flank with a sharp Ethiopian stone and take out the whole
contents of the abdomen, which they then cleanse, washing
it thoroughly with palm wine, and again frequently with an
infusion of pounded aromatics. After this they fill the cavity
with the purest bruised myrrh, with cassia, and every sort of
spice except frankincense, and sew up the opening. Then
the body is placed in natrum for 70 days and covered entire-
ly over. After the expiration of this space of time, which
must not be exceeded, the body is washed, and wrapped
round, from head to foot, with bandages of fine linen cloth,
smeared over with gum, which is used generally by the
Egyptians in the place of glue, and in this state it is given
back to the relations, who enclose it in a wooden case
which they have made for this purpose, and shaped into the
figure of a man. Then fastening the case, they place it in a
sepulchral chamber, upright against the wall. Such is the
most costly way of embalming the dead.”
Herodotus’s account has been confirmed as basically
accurate by modern analysis of Egyptian mummies. Mum-
mification evolved considerably during the 2,000 years from
its beginning in the Old Kingdom to the time described by
Herodotus. All internal organs except the heart, which was
considered the seat of emotions and intellect, were
removed to prevent decomposition and putrefaction. By tra-
dition, the abdominal incision was made with an Ethiopian
stone, which was as sharp as a razor. The lungs, stomach,
liver, intestines, and other organs were embalmed with
natron, which was the primary drying agent used in mummi-
fication. This salt worked by absorbing water from the inter-
nal organs, muscles, and blood before microbial action and
decomposition could begin. Once the process of enzymatic
decomposition of protein begins, there is production of foul-
smelling compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, ammonia,
and mercaptans. The tissues decompose and rot away.
When the organs were sufficiently dried out, they were
placed into ornamental burial jars usually made of lime-
stone. These were called “canopic jars” named in honor of
the Greek legend of Canopus, who was buried in Egypt. It is
said that he was worshipped in the form of a jar with feet.
Each canopic jar contained a different organ. The lid of
each jar was carved in the shape of one of the four sons of
Horus: Mesti, the human-headed son; Duamutef, the jackal;
Hapi, the baboon; and Qebesenef, the hawk.

During the 21st dynasty (1085 to 945 B.C.E.) embalmers
began wrapping the internal organs with long strips of linen
and then replacing them back into the body as “visceral
packages.” This may have been done to dissuade grave
robbers from opening or destroying canopic jars in search
for jewels and treasures. With this technique there was no
need for a canopic jar, and imitation one-piece canopic jars
were sometimes placed in the tombs.
The dehydrating agent used in mummification was
natron, a naturally occurring salt composed of sodium car-
bonate, sodium bicarbonate, and sodium chloride (table
salt). The two chief sources of natron in ancient Egypt were
El Kab, a city in Upper Egypt, and the Wadi Natrun, an area
just outside Cairo. In Arabic the word wadi means “dry river
bed.” The chemical symbol for sodium, Na, is derived from
the word natron.
The body was placed on a slanted embalming table and
completely covered with natron. A groove in the dependent
end of the table allowed the fluids to drain off. The human
body is about 70 percent water, and during mummification
there is considerable loss of weight due to loss of water. It
was very likely that embalming took place outside in a tent,
which allowed better ventilation. Anubis, the jackal-headed
god of embalming, is often referred to as being “in his tent.”
Once the body was dehydrated, the abdominal and
chest cavities were then washed with palm oil and aromatic
spices. The abdominal incision site was sewn together, and
a metallic amulet, inscribed with the sacred eye of the god
Horus, was placed over the incision. The body was then
covered with a mixture of cedar oil and spices. A protective
coating of dark-colored resin was poured over the body as
a sealant to prevent moisture from entering the body. The
body was anointed with oil mixed with spices and perfumes.
Finally the corpse was wrapped in numerous turns of linen
bandages. Laid out end-to-end, the linen would measure
hundreds of yards long.
At the time of burial the body was adorned with gold,
jewels, and amulets. The amulets were prescribed by the
Book of the Dead and were supposed to aid the deceased
on his journey to the underworld. These valuable objects,
which were placed beneath the wrappings, would become
the targets of grave robbers over the ensuing centuries.
The coating resin imparted a dark color to the skin 
of the mummies. Foreign travelers to Egypt mistakenly
assumed that the blackened, solidified resin covering the
mummies was bitumen, the mineral formed from pitch. Since
the major source of bitumen was a mountain in Persia 
(Iran), where the substance was called “mummia,” these
embalmed bodies eventually became known as “mummies.”
The process of mummification has been studied for
centuries. Visual inspection necessitates that the mummy
be unwrapped from its burial cloth. Anatomic dissection of
a mummy results in the irrevocable destruction of the
“intact body” and violates the ancient Egyptians’ desire to
remain whole in the hereafter. With the advent of the X ray,
mummies could be studied without destroying or even dis-
turbing them. The first published radiograph of mummified
remains appeared in 1898, only three years after the discov-
ery of the X ray by Wilhelm Konrad Röntgen in 1895. Other
reports followed.
With the invention of computed tomography (CT) in
1972, a much more powerful nondestructive tool became
available to scientists and Egyptologists interested in study-
ing human and animal mummies.
CT provides excellent detail of the inside of a mummy.
A collaborative project performed between the author and
the Albany Institute of History and Art (AIHA) in Albany,
New York, in November 1988, involved the plain film and CT
analysis of two ancient human Egyptian mummies. Both
mummies have been part of AIHA’s Egyptian collection
since their purchase from the Cairo Museum in 1909. The
mummies came from the ancient community of Thebes on
the upper Nile, and they lived during the 21st Egyptian
dynasty, which was from 1085 to 945 B.C.E.
Egyptian Mummies: 
Brief History and Radiological Studies 
(continued)
This female mummy at the Albany Institute of History and
Art has never been unwrapped and has only been “seen”
by X ray and CT. Once believed to be a male priest, the 1988
X-ray and CT studies performed by Dr. Wagle proved it to
be the body of a female. She is five feet tall. (Courtesy of
William Wagle, M.D.)

Murphy, William Parry
235
One of the mummies had been obtained uncovered
from the waist up. X rays performed in the Radiology
Department at Albany Medical Center showed that this
mummy had a male pelvic structure. The other mummy
was completely wrapped in the original burial bandage
(3,000 years old), and it had always been assumed that this
was another male priest. X rays, however, demonstrated a
female pelvic structure, proving this to be the mummy of a
woman. According to the hieroglyphics on the side of the
wooden coffin containing the male mummy, he was a
priest named Ankhefenmut. Since the coffin was not
sealed at the time it was obtained by the AIHA, absolute
identification of this mummy could not be certain. The
name and station in life of the female mummy remain a
mystery to this day.
X rays of each mummy included the skull, spine, pelvis,
and lower extremities. Skeletal structures were amazingly
well preserved. The 3,000-year-old bones had an apparently
normal density and were not eroded or fractured. CT stud-
ies visualized the thoracic and abdominal cavities, cranial
vault, and spinal canal. As described in other studies
including anatomic dissection and CT, the oval-shaped
objects in the thoraco-abdominal cavities contained the
dried-out inner organs wrapped in multiple layers of linen,
which created a “jelly-roll” appearance on CT. The skull
was filled with air and a solidified liquid that corresponds to
the resin used in the mummification process. Because the
cranial vault and the spinal canal are contiguous, the resin
had flowed into both and had solidified.
The most novel finding of this study was the discovery
of a well-crafted, two-component great-toe prosthesis (arti-
ficial toe) in the female mummy. This prosthesis attaches
directly to the first metatarsal bone of the right foot. The dis-
tal portion of the prosthesis has a CT density measurement
of –600 Hounsfield units, which is that of air. This is probably
some low-density air-filled shell that looks like a toe. The
more proximal socketlike portion, which holds the toe, mea-
sures +1,318 Hounsfield units. This is very high-density
material, but it does not appear to be metal on X ray. It may
be some form of high-density ceramic, which exactly fits
the “toe” and rests upon the first metatarsal bone of the
foot. This prosthesis has only been visualized with X ray and
CT because the female mummy has never been unwrapped
from her burial cloth. The reason for the artificial toe stems
from the ancient Egyptian belief that one should enter the
hereafter “whole.”
A recent report in the British medical journal The Lancet
describes a wooden prosthesis of the great right toe of a
female mummy from the 21st or 22nd dynasty (ca. 1065–740
B.C.E.), which is the same time period as the AIHA mummy.
The amputation site was covered with skin, indicating that it
was an intravital (during life) amputation. This prosthesis was
composed of three separate components. The main compo-
nent consisted of a perfectly shaped wooden corpus (12 × 3.5
× 3.5 cm), which resembled a big toe including the nail. This
was attached to two small wooden plates that were fixed to
each other by seven leather strings. According to the
authors, there were clear marks of use on the sole of the
prosthetic toe, indicating that it had been used during life.
In early 1989 a collaborative study was performed
between the AIHA, the author, and William Lorensen, Ph.D.,
of the General Electric Corporate Research & Development
in Schenectady, New York. The CT data obtained from the
November 1988 mummy studies was used to perform the
first-ever computer-assisted “unwrapping” of a mummy.
Using a proprietary surface-algorithm program developed
by Dr. Lorensen, the mummy’s facial linen was removed in a
computer program capable of sensing differences in sur-
face shading. (The original study is in the archives of GE
Corporate Research & Development.) When multiple
images from this study are viewed in ciné mode, there is
clearly the visual impression that the linens are actually
being removed.
Computed tomography (CT) shows the prosthesis on a
mummy’s foot. The prosthesis is composed of a high-density
U-shaped holder and a low-density “toe.” The mummy has
never been unwrapped, and only X ray and CT have 
provided images of one of the most carefully constructed
toe prostheses ever seen. This appears in an article written
by Dr. Wagle for the American Journal of Roentgenology in
April 1994. (Courtesy of William Wagle, M.D.)

In a 2002 published report, state-of-the-art helical CT
provided color three-dimensional reconstructed images so
detailed that even braided hair could be seen. Sequential
three-dimensional fly-through images allowed visualization
of the thoraco-abdominal cavity in such a way that the
viewer feels as though he is inside the cavity and “looking
around.” The technique provides an endoscopic journey
throughout the cavity.
Analysis with DNA sampling is extremely accurate
and will open up new avenues of detective work that 
have not been available for the past 3,000 years. It may
someday be possible to link mummies that now reside in
different countries and may also allow Egyptologists to
date mummies from different dynasties. We may learn that
Ankhefenmut has relatives in other museums throughout
the world.

organism. In the case of site-directed mutagenesis, the
substitution or modification of a single amino acid at a
defined location in a protein is performed by changing
one or more BASE PAIRS in the DNA using recombinant
DNA technology.
mutation
A heritable change in the NUCLEOTIDE
SEQUENCE of genomic DNA (or RNA in RNA virus-
es), or in the number of GENEs or chromosomes in a
cell, that can occur spontaneously or be brought
about by chemical mutagens or by radiation (induced
mutation).
mutualism
A state where two different species ben-
efit from their association. Two types exist: symbiotic
and nonsymbiotic mutualism. Examples include
lichens (algae and fungi), mycorrhizae and rooting
plants, yucca plant pollination by the yucca moth, and
bees and flowers. In symbiotic mutualism, both indi-
viduals interact physically, and their relationship is
biologically essential for survival, e.g., the fungus–
alga relationship. The more common nonsymbiotic
mutualism is when individuals live independent lives
but cannot survive without each other, e.g., bees and
flowering plants.
mutual prodrug
The association in a unique
molecule of two, usually synergistic, DRUGs attached to
each other, one drug being the carrier for the other and
vice versa.
mycelium
Threadlike tubes, filaments, or hyphae;
the roots of mushrooms; the thalus or vegetative part
of a fungus. Bacteria (Actinomycetales) also produce
branched mycelium.
mycorrhizae
A symbiotic (mutualism) connection
between plant roots and the mycelia of some fungi
species. The fungus provides water and mineral nutri-
ents to the plant, and the plant provides energy to the
fungus. Ectomycorrhizae form between tree species
and basidiomycete fungi, and the fungus provides a
sheath around the root that it penetrates. Endomycor-

rhizae form when the fungus hyphae grow between
and within the cells of the plant roots. Many species
cannot grow without their mycorrhizae connections.
myelin
A lipid that forms a multilayered sheath
around some nerve fibers (axons) in the central, auto-
nomic, and peripheral nervous systems.
myelin sheath
Multilayered specialized Schwann cells
(nonconducting glial cells) that help provide the efficient
movement of signals by coating and insulating sections
(internodes) of neurons (axons) in the nervous system.
myiasis
An infection caused by fly maggots. Primary
myiasis is when a fly deposits eggs on the host and the
maggots feed upon living tissue. Secondary myiasis
occurs first when there is a break in the skin that
allows maggots the access to tissue.
myocrysin
See GOLD DRUGS.
myofibril
A long, cylindrical, contractile filament
within muscle or muscle fiber that makes up striated
muscle. Each myofibril contains intertwined filaments
of muscle proteins, myosin, and actin; called a
sacromere. The myofibril bundles have alternate light
and dark bands (thick and thin) that contain these pro-
tein filaments responsible for the muscle’s contractile
ability, and these give it the characteristic striated look
under a microscope.
myoglobin
A monomeric dioxygen-binding heme-
protein of muscle tissue, structurally similar to a SUB-
UNIT of HEMOGLOBIN.
myopia (nearsightedness; shortsightedness)
An inher-
ited disorder where a refractive error in the eye means
that the shape of the eye does not bend light correctly,
resulting in a blurred image; inability to see distant
objects clearly because the images are focused in front
of the retina.
myosin
A thick contractile protein found in myofib-
rils that interacts with actin, another protein, to create
contraction in a muscle cell. It is the most abundant
protein in muscles fibrils.
myriapods
A group of organisms comprising cen-
tipedes and millipedes, which are long, flattened, 
segmented predators; each segment bears a pair of legs.
Centipedes evolved during the Silurian period, and

myelin
Transmission electron micrograph of part of a striated muscle fiber
(cell) from the human neck. Striated muscle cells are elongated,
hence their description as fibers. Each cell has several nuclei 
(not visible) positioned just below the sarcolemma, the name given
to the cell membrane of muscle cells. Running the length of each
fiber are contractile protein filaments (actin and myosin myofila-
ments) arranged in bunches called myofibrils (20–30 myofibrils 
are visible here). The arrangement of the two types of myofilament
causes the prominent transverse banding, which gives striated
muscle its name. Magnification: ×8, 100 at 8 × 10-inch size.

NAD+
Oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinu-
cleotide. Note that despite the plus sign in the symbol,
the COENZYME is anionic under normal physiological
conditions. NAD+ is a coenzyme derived from the B vita-
min niacin. It is transformed into NADH when it accepts
a pair of high-energy electrons for transport in cells and
is associated with catabolic and energy-yielding reactions.
NADH
Reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinu-
cleotide (NAD). Called coenzyme I, it is an electron
donor essential for a variety of oxidation-reduction
reactions.
NADP+
Oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine di-
nucleotide phosphate. Note that despite the plus sign in
the symbol, the COENZYME is anionic under normal
physiological conditions. An enzyme commonly associ-
ated with biosynthetic reactions. NADP is a hydrogen
carrier in a wide range of redox reactions.
NADPH
Reduced form of nicotinamide adenine di-
nucleotide phosphate. An energy-rich compound pro-
duced by the light-reaction of photosynthesis. It is used
to synthesize carbohydrates in the dark-reaction.
naiad (larva, nymph)
Used to describe the interme-
diate stage, between egg and adult, of a dragonfly’s

natural killer cell (NK cell; NK lymphocyte)
A
large granular lymphocyte killer cell that attacks and
kills tumorous, cancerous, and virus-infected cells
through phagocytosis and by using chemicals that
destroy the abnormal cells. They are not specifically
targeted to any antigen the way other lymphocytes are,
and therefore they do not need additional stimulation
to attack and kill. Part of the innate immune response.

natural selection
Survival and reproduction of a
genotype that leaves more progenies who possess
attributes of fitness, survivability, and adaptation to
their environment over that of another genotype. Those
better adapted to their environment are likely to
increase in frequency over a number of generations
over those that are less adapted, and this difference is
not due to chance. It is the environment’s strong influ-
ence on the reproductive success of individuals in a
population; one of the major forces of evolution. First
promoted by Charles Darwin in the 19th century.

Neanderthal
An early type of human (Homo sapiens
neanderthalensis) that evolved in Europe about
250,000 years ago and spread to the Middle East. By
the last Ice Age, fossil remains reveal a people with
faces that had distinct eyebrow ridges, flattened noses,
and heavy jaws. Their bodies were short and well built,
all features that may have been adaptations to the cold
conditions of the last Ice Age. They appear to have sur-
vived in parts of Europe until some time after 30,000
years ago and lived for a time side by side with present-
day-type humans.

Condition describing dead plant or animal
tissue due to injury, disease, or treatment.
negative feedback
Describes a situation where an
action produces a consequence that affects, or feeds
back on, the action. In negative feedback, the conse-
quence stops or reverses the action. In biology, for
example, the stopping of the synthesis of an enzyme by
the accumulation of the products of the enzyme-medi-
ated reaction is a negative feedback reaction.
nematocyst
A small harpoonlike structure or sting-
ing capsule located in a cnidoblast that coils out; used
by coelenterates (e.g., jellyfish) to deliver a toxin to
stun or kill its prey.
nematode
Roundworms, simple worms of micro-
scopic size, consisting of an elongate stomach with a
reproduction system inside a resistant outer cuticle or
outer skin. Most feed on bacteria, fungi, and other soil
organisms; however, some are parasitic, obtaining their
nutrients from animals (dog heartworm), humans (pin-
worm), and plants. There are 15,000 known species.
They are related to the arthropods and are part of a
newly recognized group, the Ecdysozoa, which includes
the arthropods and nematodes.

nephron
A
microscopic coiled tubular structure
found in each kidney that consists of a GLOMERULUS, a
mass of capillaries that filters the blood, and a renal
tubule that produces urine for elimination. Each kidney
is estimated to contain about 1 million nephrons.
neritic zone
The part of ocean that covers all water
to a depth of 600 feet. The entire ocean is called the
pelagic zone and is divided into two major zones, the
oceanic and neritic. The oceanic covers depths below
600 feet, while the neritic zone covers depths from 0 to
600 feet.
net primary productivity (NPP)
The primary pro-
ductivity of any community is the total amount of
biomass that is produced through photosynthesis per
unit area and time by the primary producers—plants. It
is usually expressed in units of energy or in units of dry
organic matter. The annual primary production around
the world is more than 240 billion metric tons of dry
plant biomass. Productivity is further divided into gross
and net primary productivity. Gross primary productiv-
ity (GPP) is the total energy fixed by plants in a com-
munity through photosynthesis. However, a portion of
242
Neanderthal

the energy is used in plant respiration, so by subtract-
ing this from the gross primary production, the net pri-
mary productivity (NPP) is deduced, and this
represents the rate of production of biomass available
to be consumed by animals and other organisms. The
most productive areas on the Earth are those that have
higher temperatures, abundant soil nitrogen, and water.
These ecosystems include the tropical rain forest,
swamps, marshes, estuaries, and deciduous forests.
neural crest
The neural crest is formed only in verte-
brate embryos during the final stages of neurulation, a
process in vertebrates where the ectoderm of the future
brain and spinal cord—the neural plate—develops
folds (neural folds) and forms the neural tube. The neu-
ral crest consists of paired dorsal lateral streaks of cells
that migrate away from the neural tube and spread
throughout the organism to differentiate into many cell
types that contribute to the development of systems
such as skin, heart, endocrine, bones of the skull, teeth,
and even parts of the peripheral nervous system, to
name a few.
neuron
The basic data processing unit of the nervous
system; a specialized cell that carries information elec-
trically from one part of the body to another by spe-
cialized processes or extensions called dendrites and
axons. Widely branched dendrites carry nerve impulses
toward the cell body, while axons carry them away and
speed up transmitting nerve impulses (conduction)
from one neuron to another. Each neuron has a nucleus
within a cell body.
Neuroptera
An order of insects with 18 families
worldwide comprising dobsonflies, fishflies, alderflies,
spongillaflies, owlflies, snakeflies, ant lions, and
lacewings. They are characterized by having usually
similar membranous wings with many veins, held in a
rooflike position, and chewing or sucking mouthparts.
They undergo complete metamorphosis, and they are
insectivorous.
neurosecretory cells
Modified nerve cells that
have endocrine functions. Nerve cells in the hypotha-
lamus that react to other nerve cells and that have
characteristics of both neurons and endocrine cells
and release hormones (neurohormones) directly into
body fluids or storage areas. There are two classes of
neurosecretory cells in the hypothalamus. They are
located in the median eminence near the adenohy-
pophysis, the anterior glandular lobe of the pituitary,
and in the neurohypophysis, the posterior lobe of the
gland.
The adenohypophysis arises from epithelial tissue
at the roof of the mouth and includes the pars distalis,
pars tuberalis, and pars intermedia.
The median eminence is an enlarged area of the
infundibulum, the part of the brain between the
brainstem and cerebrum. Here nerve cells secrete
their releasing and inhibitory hormones that get
absorbed into the blood capillaries in the median
eminence and carried on in the venous blood down
along the infundibulum to the anterior pituitary
gland.
The adenohypophysis secretes FSH (follicle-
stimulating hormone), LH (luteinizing hormone),
ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone), TSH (thyroid-
stimulating hormone), GH (growth hormone), and
prolactin.
The neurohypophysis, or the posterior lobe of the
pituitary, is connected to the hypothalamus by the
stalklike infundibulum and receives two hormones
released by the neurons in the hypothalamus, oxy-
tocin (OT) and vasopressin or ADH (antidiuretic hor-
mone). Oxytocin and ADH are stored in the posterior
pituitary. The neurohypophysis is an outgrowth of
nervous tissue from the floor of the brain in the region
of the hypothalamus. It is made up of the pars ner-
vosa and is connected to the brain by the infundibu-
lum. Oxytocin acts on myoepithelial cells in the
mammary glands and uterine muscles, causing both to
contract. ADH stimulates the kidneys to reabsorb
more water.
The hypothalamus contains mammillary bodies,
the median eminence, and infundibulum. It contains
nuclei that produce the neurohormones. In the
supraoptic region are cell bodies of neurons in the par-
aventricular nucleus that synthesize oxytocin, while
those in the supraoptic nucleus synthesize ADH.
Neurosecretory cells are also found in other ani-
mals such as mollusks, nematodes, and platy-
helminthes, to name a few.
neurosecretory cells
243

neurotransmitter
A chemical made of amino acids
and peptides that switch on or off nerve impulses
across the synapse between neurons. Excitatory neuro-
transmitters stimulate the target cell, while inhibitory
ones inhibit the target cells. Examples of neurotrans-
mitters are acetylcholine, dopamine, noradrenaline,
and serotonin.
Acetylcholine is the most abundant neurotransmit-
ter in the body and the primary neurotransmitter
between neurons and muscles. It controls the stomach,
spleen, bladder, liver, sweat glands, blood vessels, heart,
and others. Dopamine is essential to the normal func-
tioning of the central nervous system. Noradrenaline,
or norepinephrine, act in the sympathetic nervous sys-
tem and produce powerful vasoconstriction. Serotonin
is associated with the sleep cycle.

new chemical entity
A compound not previously
described in the literature.
niche
A habitat providing a particular set of environ-
mental conditions needed for the survival of a given
species. Species that occupy different niches may coex-
ist side by side in a stable manner with no competition.
However, if two species occupy the same niche, i.e., if
they require the same resources, there will be competi-
tion, and the weaker of the two will become extirpated.
Evolutionary effects can make a species adapt to a spe-
cialized niche that has a particular set of abiotic and
biotic factors within the habitat.
Nicolle, Charles-Jules-Henry (1866–1936) French
Biologist
Charles-Jules-Henry Nicolle was born in
Rouen, France, Seine-Maritime, on September 21,
1866, to Eugène Nicolle, a local doctor. He entered a
local medical school, where he studied for three years
and then began working in Paris hospitals.
He received his M.D. degree in 1893 and returned
to Rouen, becoming director of the bacteriological lab-
oratory in 1896. He left in 1903 to become director of
the Pasteur Institute in Tunis, a position he held until
his death in 1936.
Early in his career, Nicolle worked on cancer, and
at Rouen he investigated the preparation of diphtheria
antiserum. In North Africa, under his influence, the
Institute at Tunis quickly became a world-famous cen-
ter for bacteriological research and for the production
of vaccines and serums to combat most of the prevalent
infectious diseases.
He discovered in 1909 that the body louse trans-
mits typhus fever, and this discovery was vital to pre-
vention of the disease during the two world wars. He
also made several contributions on knowledge and pre-
vention of Malta fever, tick fever, scarlet fever, rinder-
pest, measles, influenza, tuberculosis, and trachoma. In
1928 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine for his work on typhus.
Nicolle wrote several important books, including
La Nature, conception et morale biologiques (1934);
Responsabilités de la Médecine (1936), and La Des-
tinée humaine (1937).
He was also a philosopher and writer of stories,
such as Le Pâtissier de Bellone (1913), Les Feuilles de
la Sagittaire (1920), La Narquoise (1922), Les Menus
Plaisirs de l’Ennui (1924), Les deux Larrons (1929),
and Les Contes de Marmouse et ses hôtes (1930). He
died on February 28, 1936, in Tunis (Tunisia).
nif
A set of about 20 GENEs required for the assembly
of the NITROGENASE ENZYME complex.
nitrate reductase
A
METALLOENZYME, containing
molybdenum that reduces nitrate to nitrite.
nitrite reductase
A METALLOENZYME that reduces
nitrite. DISSIMILATORY nitrite reductases contain copper
and reduce nitrite to nitrogen monoxide. Assimilatory
nitrite reductases contain SIROHEME and IRON-SULFUR
CLUSTER and reduce nitrite to ammonia.
See also ASSIMILATION.

neurotransmitter

nitrogenase
An ENZYME complex from bacteria that
catalyzes the reduction of dinitrogen to ammonia: N2
+ 8e– +10H+   2NH4 + H2 with the simultaneous
HYDROLYSIS of at least 16 ATP molecules. The electron
donor is reduced FERREDOXIN or flavodoxin. Dihydro-
gen is always a coproduct of the reaction. Ethyne
(acetylene) can also be reduced to ethene (ethylene)
and in some cases ethane. All nitrogenases are IRON-
SULFUR PROTEINS. Three different types, which differ in
the type of COFACTOR present, have been identified:
molybdenum-nitrogenase (the most common, which
contains the iron-molybdenum cofactor), vanadium-
nitrogenase, and iron-only nitrogenase.
See also FEMO-COFACTOR; REDUCTION.
nitrogen fixation
The natural process where atmo-
spheric nitrogen, N2, is converted to compounds that
can be easily utilized by plants. All organisms require
nitrogen compounds, but few are able to utilize N2, a
relatively inert and unreactive form and, unfortunately,
the most readily available. Most organisms require
fixed forms such as NH3, NO3, NO2, or organic N.
Bacteria perform nitrogen fixation by combining the
nitrogen with hydrogen to form nitrates (NH3) in the
soil, which plants can then use. Cyanobacteria (blue-
green algae) and bacteria (e.g., Rhizobium spp.; Azoto-
bacter spp.) associated with legumes (like peas) can fix
N2 by reducing it to ammoniacal (ammonialike) N,
mostly in the form of amino acids.
The ASSIMILATION of dinitrogen through microbial
reduction to ammonia and conversion into organoni-
trogen compounds such as amino acids. Only a limited
number of microorganisms are able to fix nitrogen.

Monosomy is the condition of possessing only one copy of a particular chromosome instead of the normal two copies. (Courtesy of 
Darryl Leja, NHGRI, National Institutes of Health)

noncyclic electron flow
The first stage of photo-
synthesis; begins when light energy enters a cluster of
pigment molecules (called the photosystem) located in
the thylakoid. The light-induced flow of electrons from
water to NADP in oxygen-evolving photosynthesis
involving both photosystems I and II. Photosystems
are large complexes of proteins and chlorophyll that
capture energy from sunlight. Both systems I and II
include special forms of chlorophyll A. Photosystem I,
or P-700, includes chlorophyll A pigment with a spe-
cific absorbance of 700 nm (red light). Photosystem II,
or P-680, contains the reaction center responsible for
oxygen evolution and contains a special chlorophyll A
that absorbs light at 680 nm (red light). If the photo-
chemical reactions in photosystem II are inhibited,
photosystem I is inhibited as well.
noncyclic photophosphorylation
The formation of
ATP by NONCYCLIC ELECTRON FLOW.
nondisjunction
The failure of paired chromosomes
to separate normally and migrate to opposite poles
after cell division, thereby giving rise to cells that have
too many or too few chromosomes. This results in
monosomy, where one member of a chromosome pair
is missing, or trisomy, where there is an extra chromo-
some in any of the chromosome pairs.
nonpolar covalent bond
A covalent bond formed
by the equal sharing of electrons between two atoms
with the same electronegativity. Electronegativity is the
tendency of an atom to attract electrons to itself in a
covalent bond.
nonsense mutation
A mutation where one of the
mRNA sequences (UAA, UAG, UGA) signals the termi-
nation of translation, the process whereby the genetic
code carried by mRNA directs the synthesis of proteins
from amino acids; a codon is changed to a stop codon,
prematurely stopping polypeptide chain synthesis.
These three nonsense codons are amber (UAG), ocher
(UAA), and opal (UGA).
See also MESSENGER RNA.
norm of reaction
An expression or variation in
pattern among phenotypes produced by a single
genotype caused by a variation in environmental con-
ditions. While phenotypes are an expression of genes
in an organism that give it certain traits and charac-
ters (anatomical structure, physiology, and behavior)
that can be measured, sometimes the traits are actual-
ly norms of reaction, i.e., traits expressed in different
ways in different environments. For example, human
body weight or height is different in identical envi-
ronments or on different diets. Take a set of genes
that produce a particular trait together, list all the
possible environmental conditions that they can sur-
vive in, and the norm of reaction is the total variation
in that trait in all of the survivable environmental
conditions.
notochord
A rodlike cord, a rudimentary skeleton,
composed of stiff cartilage in chordates that runs
lengthwise under the dorsal (top) surface of the body.
It forms the support structure of the body, supporting
the nerve cord. It is replaced by the vertebral column
later in the development of most chordates; it persists
in primitive fishes such as hagfish, coelacanth, and chi-
maeras. The phylum Chordata comprises animals
characterized by bodies that have elongated bilateral
symmetry and that, in some part of their development,
have a notochord and gill slits (or pouches), and usual-
ly have a head, tail, and digestive system with open-
ings at both ends. Chordates include the fish,
amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, but not all
chordates are vertebrates, e.g., invertebrate tunicates
and lancelets.

nuclear 
envelope (nuclear 
membrane)
A
two-
membrane structure that surrounds the nucleus. The
space between the two membranes is referred to as 
the perinuclear space. The outermost membrane meets
the rough endoplasmic reticulum and has ribosomes
attached. The inner membrane lies next to a dense 
filamentous network called the nuclear lamina and 
surrounds the nucleus, except where there are nuclear
nuclear envelope
247

pores. Nuclear pores are found where the inner and
outer membranes are joined. The space is filled with 
filamentous material. The pores are involved in regulat-
ing the transport of materials between the nucleus and
the cytoplasm.
nuclearity
The number of CENTRAL ATOMs joined in
a single COORDINATION entity by BRIDGING LIGANDs or
metal-metal bonds is indicated by dinuclear, trinuclear,
tetranuclear, polynuclear, etc.
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
NMR spectroscopy makes it possible to discriminate
nuclei, typically protons, in different chemical environ-
ments. The electron distribution gives rise to a chemical
shift of the resonance frequency. The chemical shift, δ,
of a nucleus is expressed in parts per million (ppm) by
its frequency, νn, relative to a standard, νref, and
defined as δ = 106 (νn – νref)/νo, where νo is the operat-
ing frequency of the spectrometer. It is an indication of
the chemical state of the group containing the nucleus.
More information is derived from the SPIN–SPIN COU-
PLINGs between nuclei, which give rise to multiple pat-
terns. Greater detail can be derived from two- or
three-dimensional techniques. These use pulses of radi-
ation at different nuclear frequencies, after which the
response of the spin system is recorded as a free-induc-
tion decay (FID). Multidimensional techniques, such as
COSY and NOESY, make it possible to deduce the
structure of a relatively complex molecule such as a
small protein (molecular weight up to 25,000). In pro-
teins containing paramagnetic centers, nuclear HYPER-
FINE interactions can give rise to relatively large shifts
of resonant frequencies, known as contact and pseudo-

The nucleic acid probe provides a new way of studying how large numbers of genes interact with each other and how a cell’s regulatory
networks control vast batteries of genes simultaneously. The method uses a robot to precisely apply tiny droplets containing functional
DNA to glass slides. Researchers then attach flourescent labels to DNA from the cell they are studying. The labeled probes are allowed
to bind to complementary DNA strands on the slides. The slides are put into a scanning microscope that can measure the brightness of
each fluorescent dot. The brightness reveals how much of a specific DNA fragment is present, an indicator of how active it is. (Courtesy

the nuclear spin relaxation rates. From this type of
measurement, structural information can be obtained
about the paramagnetic site.
nuclear pores
Openings in the membrane of a cell’s
nuclear envelope that allow the exchange of materials
between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.
nucleation
The process by which nuclei are formed;
defined as the smallest solid-phase aggregate of atoms,
molecules, or ions that is formed during a precipitation
and that is capable of spontaneous growth.
nucleic acid probe (DNA probe)
A single strand
of DNA that is labeled or tagged with a fluorescent or
radioactive substance and binds specifically to a com-
plementary DNA sequence. It is used to detect its
incorporation through hybridization with another
DNA sample. Nuclear acid probes can provide rapid
identification of certain species like mycobacterium.
nucleic 
acids
Macromolecules 
composed 
of
SEQUENCEs of NUCLEOTIDES that perform several func-
tions in living cells—e.g., the storage of genetic infor-
mation and its transfer from one generation to the next
(DNA), and the EXPRESSION of this information in pro-
tein synthesis (mRNA, tRNA)—and can act as func-
tional components of subcellular units such as
RIBOSOMEs (rRNA). RNA contains D-ribose, while
DNA contains 2-deoxy-D-ribose as the sugar compo-
nent. Currently, synthetic nucleic acids can be made
consisting of hundreds of nucleotides.

A somewhat round structure in the nucle-
us that forms at the nuclear organizer, a specific chro-
mosomal region, consisting of ribosomal RNA (rRNA)
and protein. It disappears during nuclear division in
late prophase, is completely absent during meta and
anaphase, and then reappears during telephase. The
nucleus controls the synthesis of proteins in the cyto-
plasm through messenger RNA (mRNA). Messenger

nucleosides
Compounds in which a purine or pyrim-
idine base is ß-N-glycosidically bound to C-1 of either
2-deoxy-D-ribose or of D-ribose, but without any
phosphate groups. The common nucleosides in biologi-
cal systems are adenosine, guanosine, cytidine, and uri-

material chromosomes are made of, consisting of about
150–200 base pairs of DNA wrapped around a core
complex of eight histone proteins (two molecules each
of histones H2a, H2b, H3, and H4). Histones are a
type of protein associated with DNA in chromosomes
in the nucleus, and they function to coil the DNA into
nucleosomes.
nucleotides
Nucleosides with one or more phos-
phate groups esterified mainly to the 3- or the 5- posi-
tion of the sugar moiety. Nucleotides found in cells are
adenylic acid, guanylic acid, uridylic acid, cytidylic
acid, deoxyadenylic acid, deoxyguanylic acid, deoxy-
cytidylic acid, and thymidylic acid. A nucleotide is a
nucleoside in which the primary hydroxy group of
either 2-deoxy-D-ribose or of D-ribose is esterified by
orthophosphoric acid.

oceanic zone
The ocean is divided into zones. The
whole mass of water is called the pelagic. This is divid-
ed into two major subzones: the neritic zone, which
covers all water to a depth of 600 feet, and the oceanic
zone, which covers all water below 600 feet. The
oceanic zone is further divided into subzones. The
mesopelagic (semidark waters) covers the depths from
650 feet to 3,200 feet, which is the middle layer
between the upper (sunlit 650 feet) epipelagic and the
lower (cold and dark) bathypelagic.

ommatidium
A single unit, or visual section, of a
compound eye such as that found in insects. It resem-
bles a single simple eye that descends directly into the
eye core. Each ommatidium contains a corneal lens,
crystalline cone, and pigment and retinula cells and
functions as a single eye sending an image to the brain.
The insect’s brain must take all the messages from each
ommatidia and piece the image together.
omnivore
An animal that eats both plant and animal
material. Humans are omnivores.
See also CARNIVORE.
oncogene
A normal cellular gene that, when inap-
propriately expressed or mutated, can transform
eukaryotic cells into tumor cells. A gene that controls
cell growth but also is responsible for directing the
uncontrolled growth of tumor or cancer if it is dam-
aged by means such as an inheritance defect, mutation,
or environmental exposure such as to carcinogens.
There are dozens of oncogenes known, and they func-
tion in a variety of ways, but their commonality is the
overexpression that interferes with the normal regula-
tion of cell growth.
ontogeny
The life history of one individual and its
stages as it evolves from zygote to adult. The opposite
of phylogeny, which is the history of a group.
oogamy

female ovum; developing a diploid cell into a haploid egg.
open circulatory system
A type of circulatory sys-
tem where the internal transport of blood flows
through the body cavity and bathes the organs directly
and not through a system of vessels. Humans have a
closed circulatory system, which is a type of circulatory
system where the blood flows through a system of ves-
sels and the heart. Examples include horseshoe crabs,
lobsters, and insects.
operant conditioning
A type of associative learning
behavior also called trial-and-error learning, or instru-
mental conditioning. It is a method to modify behavior
(an operant) that utilizes contingencies between the
response and the presentation of the reinforcer. Based
on the 1938 experiments of Burrhus Friederich Skinner
(rats pressing lever for food) and published in his book
The Behavior of Organisms.
operon
A functional unit consisting of a PROMOTER,
an operator, and a number of structural GENEs, found
mainly in PROKARYOTEs. An example is the operon NIF.
The structural genes commonly code for several func-
tionally related ENZYMEs, and although they are tran-
scribed as one (polycistronic) mRNA, each has its
separate TRANSLATION initiation site. In the typical
operon, the operator region acts as a controlling ele-
ment in switching on or off the synthesis of mRNA.
Also refers to a group or sequence of closely linked
genes that function as a unit in synthesizing enzymes
needed for biosynthesis of a molecule and that is con-
trolled by operator and repressor genes; common in
bacteria and phages. An operator gene is the region of
the chromosome, next to the operon, where a repressor
protein binds to prevent transcription of the operon.
The repressor gene protein binds to an operator adja-
cent to the structural gene, preventing the transcription
of the operon.
opsonization
The modification of the surface of a
bacterium by coating or deposition of an opsonin (an
antibody or complement), which is a group of proteins
that lyse organisms. An opsonin coats a bacterium in
order to enhance its ability to be eaten (phagocytosis) by
macrophages and other leukocytes; an immune response.
optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR)
A double-resonance technique in which transitions
between spin sublevels are detected by optical means.
Usually these are sublevels of a triplet, and the transi-
tions are induced by microwaves.

ly. The order consists of groups that are more alike
than those in a class.
See also TAXON.
organ
A specialized combination of two or more dif-
ferent tissues that performs a particular function. Sever-
al organs work together in an organ system to perform
a set of coordinated functions. There are ten major
organ systems in the human body, and each system is
made up of one or more organs. These systems include
the circulatory, digestive, endocrine, integumentary,
muscular, nervous, reproductive, respiratory, skeletal,
and urinary systems.
organelle
The “organs” of the cell. Any membrane-
bound or nonmembrane-bound structure that is spe-
cialized in performing a specific role in the cell.
Examples of organelles are chloroplasts, centrosomes,
Golgi apparatus, ribosomes, mitochondria, and even
the nucleus.
organic chemistry
The study of carbon (organic)
compounds; used to study the complex nature of living
things. Organic compounds are composed mostly of
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen atoms bonded
together. One of two main divisions of chemistry. The
other is inorganic chemistry. Branches of these two
include analytical, biochemical, and physical chemistry.
organism

contains thousands of hairlike receptor cells that
respond to different sound frequencies and convert
them to nerve impulses through the auditory nerve to
the brain.

sexes during human sexual activity; the highest point of
sexual excitement.
orphan drug
A DRUG for the treatment of a rare dis-
ease for which reasonable recovery of the sponsoring
firm’s research and development expenditure is not
expected within a reasonable time. The term is also
used to describe substances intended for such uses.
osmoconformer
Not actively changing internal
osmolarity (total solute concentration) because an ani-
mal is isotonic (body fluids are of equal concentration
with respect to osmotic pressure) with the environment.
osmolarity
Solute concentration expressed as molar-
ity. Molarity is the moles of solute dissolved in 1 liter
of solution. A solute is, in the case of a gas or solid dis-
solved in liquid, the gas or solid, but in other examples
it is the part that has the smaller amount. For example,
a beaker of salt water would have the water as the sol-
vent and the salt as the solute. The mole is defined as
the number of carbon 12 atoms in 12 grams of carbon
12. It allows scientists to weigh substances and tell how
many particles are in that substance.
See also MOLARITY.
osmoregulation
A process to control water balance
in a cell or organism with respect to the surrounding
environment using osmosis. The ability by which
organisms maintain a stable solute concentration by
maintaining osmotic pressure
on each side of a
semipermeable membrane.
osmoregulator
An organism that must take in or
discharge excess water because its body fluids have a
different osmolarity than the environment.
osmosis

solution moving by osmosis into and out of a cell and
caused by a concentration gradient.
Osteichthyes
A class of fish—“bony fish”; Oste-
ichthyes is the largest and most diverse taxon of all ver-
tebrates. Found as early as the lower Devonian period,
there are two subclasses, Actinopterygii (e.g., ray fin:
sturgeon, tuna, catfish) and Sarcopterygii (fleshy fin:
lungfish, coelacanths). Two of the most successful
groups of vertebrates ever known, with some species
adapted to breathe air. Their endoskeleton is made of
bone.
osteoporosis

sity with associated increased risk of fracture, especial-
ly of wrists, hips, and spines. Of the 10 million
Americans estimated to have osteoporosis, 8 million
are women and 2 million are men.
ostracoderm
A primitive and extinct fish without
jaws and encased in an armor of bony plates and der-
mal scales. It lived from the early Ordovician to the late
Devonian (470 to 370 million years ago). Also known
as agnathans, fossils have been found in both North
America and Europe. Pteraspids, cyathaspids, and
amphiaspids are examples.
ostracods
Aquatic crustaceans with seven pairs of
appendages, each specialized for different tasks, that
live inside a calcified carapace made of two valves.
Sexually dimorphic, i.e., males and females are differ-
ent shapes. There are more than 50,000 named
species.
outgroup
During a phylogenetic analysis, an out-
group is any group that is not included in the study
group but is related to the group under study. Used for
comparative purposes. An outgroup is chosen because
it is related to the taxon under study, but it has an
ancestor in a more distant past than the taxon being
classified.
ovarian cycle
Determines the menstrual cycle in
the ovary; a regular cyclic event that comprises two
phases and ovulation: the follicular phase (before
ovulation), ovulation itself, and the luteal phase
(after ovulation but before a new follicular phase). It
normally lasts for 11 to 16 days and is regulated by
hormones.
ovary
The female organ or gonad, located on each
side of the uterus, that produces oocytes that develop
into mature eggs. The ovaries are connected by the
fallopian tubes, also called the oviducts. They also
produce female estrogens (estradiol and proges-
terone) that are responsible for secondary sexual
characteristics.
oviduct
Another name for fallopian tubes, hollow
organs about 12 centimeters long (about 6 inches) that
join the ovary to the uterus and that transport the
ovum.
oviparous
Refers to a process in which a female ani-
mal produces eggs that develop and hatch outside the
body. In oviparous species, fertilization occurs when
the sperm meet the ova as they pass through the
oviduct. Insects such as butterflies and moths are
oviparous. They lay their eggs on leaves in which the
larvae hatch.
ovotransferrin
An iron-binding protein from eggs,
structurally similar to the TRANSFERRINs.
ovoviviparous
Animals that reproduce by eggs that
remain in the mother’s uterus until they are ready to
hatch. The young emerge alive with only a membrane
to break away from. There is no umbilical cord
attached to a placenta. Some fish and reptiles are 
ovoviviparous.

osmotic pressure

ovulation
The process in which a mature ovary folli-
cle opens and releases an egg (secondary oocyte)
enclosed in a mucouslike material. In mammals, one
egg is released each menstrual cycle.
See also OVARY.
ovule
A protective structure in seed plants where the
female gametophyte develops, and where fertilization
occurs. The integument, a layer of tissue, surrounds the
ovule and it becomes a seed.
ovum
Alternative term for egg. It is the secondary
oocyte in mammals. Unfertilized haploid nonmotile
egg cell.
oxidase
An ENZYME that catalyzes the oxidation of
SUBSTRATEs by O2.
oxidation
A process where one or more electrons are
lost, and the oxidation state of some atom increases. It
can occur only in combination with reduction, a pro-
cess where electrons are gained and the oxidation state
of some atom decreases.
oxidation number
The oxidation number of an
element in any chemical entity is the number of
charges that would remain on a given atom if the
pairs of electrons in each bond to that atom were
assigned to the more electronegative member of the
bond pair. The oxidation number of an element is
indicated by a roman numeral placed in parentheses
immediately following the name (modified if neces-
sary by an appropriate ending) of the element to
which it refers. The oxidation number can be positive,
negative, or zero. Zero, not a roman numeral, is rep-
resented by the usual cipher, 0. The positive sign is
never used. An oxidation number is always positive
unless the minus sign is explicitly used. Note that it
cannot be nonintegral. Nonintegral numbers may
seem appropriate in some cases where a charge is
spread over more than one atom, but such a use is not
encouraged. In such ambiguous cases, the charge
number, which designates ionic charge, can be used. A
charge number is a number in parentheses written
without a space immediately after the name of an ion,
and whose magnitude is the ionic charge. Thus the
number may refer to cations or anions, but never to
neutral species. The charge is written in Arabic
numerals and followed by the sign of the charge.
In a COORDINATION entity, the oxidation number
of the CENTRAL ATOM is defined as the charge it would
bear if all the LIGANDs were removed along with the
electron pairs that were shared with the central atom.
Neutral ligands are formally removed in their closed-
shell configurations. Where it is not feasible or reason-
able to define an oxidation state for each individual
member of a group or CLUSTER, it is again recommend-
ed that the overall oxidation level of the group be
defined by a formal ionic charge, the net charge on the
coordination entity.
See also MIXED VALENCY.
oxidative addition
The INSERTION of a metal of a
COORDINATION entity into a covalent bond involving
formally an overall two-electron loss on one metal or a
one-electron loss on each of two metals.
oxidative phosphorylation
An aerobic process of
energy harnessing by the production of ATP (energy)
in mitochondria by enzymatic phosphorylation of
ADP coupled to an electron transport chain (ETC).
The ETC is a series of mitochondrial enzymes (pro-
tein carrier molecules) in the mitochondrial mem-
branes. As high-energy electrons are shuttled down
the chain via NADH and FADH2 (flavin adenine di-
nucleotide) to oxygen molecules, they produce ATP
and water.
oxidizing agent
An atom or ion that causes another
to be oxidized, and therefore the agent to become
reduced. It is a reactant that accepts electrons from
another reactant. Oxygen, chlorine, ozone, and perox-
ide compounds are examples of oxidizing agents.
oxidoreductase
An ENZYME of EC class 1, which
catalyzes an oxidation-reduction reaction.
See also EC NOMENCLATURE FOR ENZYMES.
oxidoreductase
257

oxygen
One of the most important elements for
biological systems and for other processes, such as
reacting with other substances to release energy. One
tree can produce enough oxygen in one week to meet
the demands of a person’s daily oxygen need. Oxygen
is needed in oxidation-reduction reactions within
cells. Cellular respiration is the process that releases
energy by breaking down food molecules in the pres-
ence of oxygen. Atomic symbol is O; atomic number
is 8.
oxygen-evolving complex (OEC)
The 
ENZYME
that catalyzes the formation of O2 in PHOTOSYNTHE-
SIS. Contains a CLUSTER of probably four manganese
ions.
ozone (O3)
A form of oxygen containing three atoms
instead of the common two; formed by ultraviolet radia-
tion reacting with oxygen. Ozone accounts for the dis-
tinctive odor of the air after a thunderstorm or around
electrical equipment, first reported as early as 1785;
ozone’s chemical constitution was established in 1872.
The ozone layer in the upper atmosphere blocks harmful
ultraviolet radiation that normally causes skin cancer.
Ozone is an oxidizer and a disinfectant, and it forms
hydrogen peroxide when mixed with water. The Earth’s
ozone layer protects all life from the sun’s harmful radia-
tion, but human activities have damaged this shield. The
United States, in cooperation with over 140 other coun-
tries, is phasing out the production of ozone-depleting
substances in an effort to safeguard the ozone layer.

pacemaker
Another name for the sinoatrial (SA)
node.
See also SA NODE.
paedogenesis
The ability to reproduce while still in
immature or larval stage; acceleration of reproductive
ability.
paedomorphosis
Retainment of ancestral juven-
ile characteristics in the adult form. Can occur
through neoteny or progenesis (acceleration of gonad 
development).
paleontology
The scientific study of past life forms,
both plant and animal, in their geological and paleoen-
vironmental context. It can be in the form of study of
fossils of organisms or their by-products. The field has
several subdisciplines, including micropaleontology,
paleobotany, palynology, invertebrate and vertebrate
paleontology, human paleontology or paleoanthropolo-
gy, taphonomy, and ichnology. James Hall (1811–98),
New York State’s first paleontologist, is considered the
father of American paleontology.
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
Pangaea
The name given to the one huge landmass,
or supercontinent, that existed during the Permian (280
to 248 million years ago) through the JURASSIC PERIOD
(206 to 144 million years ago). Pangaea began to break
apart during the Jurassic, forming two more large conti-
nents, GONDWANALAND and LAURASIA. Gondwanaland,
or Gondwana, formed the southern supercontinent, and
its remnants are now the continents South America,
Africa, India, Australia, and Antarctica. Laurasia, the
northern supercontinent, has as its remnants current
North America, Europe, Asia, Greenland, and Iceland.
paraphyletic
Refers to a group of individuals
(taxon) that includes the most recent common ancestor
of all of its members, but does not include all of the
descendants of that most recent common ancestor.
parasite
Any plant or animal that lives on or in
another organism, the host, to obtain its nutrients and
eventually harming or killing the host; only the parasite
benefits. Examples of parasites are ticks, fleas, trema-
todes, lice, Giardia lamblia, Sacculina, and plants such
as rafflesia and dodder (Cuscuta sp.) Parasites can be
ectoparasites (living on the host, e.g., tick) or endopar-
asites (living within the host, e.g., tapeworm).
parasitism
The symbiotic relationship between two
organisms where one species, the parasite, benefits, but
the other, the host, is harmed. If the parasite kills the
host it endangers its own survival.
259
P

parasitoid
An organism that lives in or on the body
of a single host individual during its development and
eventually kills the host. Falls between a predator and a
true parasite.
parasympathetic division
(craniosacral division)
One of two divisions of the autonomic nervous system.
The parasympathetic deals with conserving energy,
digestion of food, and excretory functions; encourages
sedentary functions as opposed to the sympathetic divi-
sion; increases the nutrient content in the blood, which
stimulates growth and storage of energy reserves. Other
responses include a decreased heart rate and airway
and pupil diameters.
parathyroid glands
A set of four glands, two in the
left lobe of the thyroid gland and two in the right lobe.
They function to control blood calcium levels by secret-
ing parathyroid hormone (PTH). If too much calcium
is allowed in the blood, a condition known as hyper-
parathyroidism occurs; if the blood calcium is too low,
a condition known as hypoparathyroidism can exist.
The parathyroid hormone also stimulates absorption of
food by the intestines and conservation of calcium by
the kidneys.
Parazoa
The animal subkingdom of sponges, the
phylum Porifera. Mostly mouthless marine multicellu-
lar sessile animals that feed by drawing in microorgan-
isms through their pores (suspension feeders). Four
classes of sponges exist: Calcarea (calcareous sponges),
Hexactinellida (glass sponges), and Demospongiae (the
largest and most diverse, 90 percent of known species),
and Sclerospongiae (mostly fossil records). There are
about 5,000 species of sponges.
parenchyma
One of the three types of plant tis-
sue; unspecialized, composed of large thin-walled
cells forming the greater part of leaves, roots, the
pulp of fruit, and the pith of stems; Has an abun-
dance of plastids, chloroplast-containing cells able to
perform photosynthesis in leaves and stems (when
filled with chloroplasts, called chlorenchyma). The
cells of a plant’s “ground tissue,” composed of
parenchyma cells that function in assimilation and
storage, are called assimilates. Parenchyma tissues
are the mesophyll, an important assimilation tissue;
the palisade parenchyma, directly beneath the epider-
mis of the upper part of a leaf; and the spongy
parenchyma, which fills the spaces beneath the pal-
isade parenchyma. Parenchyma are the only cells
that can engage in mitosis and are the only type of
cell found in apical meristems. Parenchyma found in
the air-filled floating leaves of aquatic plants are
called aerenchyma.
parthenogenesis
A form of reproduction in many
lower animals in which the egg develops into a new
individual without fertilization. In certain social
insects, such as ants and honeybees, the unfertilized
eggs develop into male drones.
partial agonist
An AGONIST that is unable to induce
maximal activation of a RECEPTOR population, regard-
less of the amount of DRUG applied.
See also INTRINSIC ACTIVITY.
partial pressure
Each gas in a mixture of 
gases exerts a pressure called the partial pressure. It
is the pressure exerted by one gas in a mixture of
gases.
passive transport (diffusion)
A molecule or ion
that crosses a biological membrane by moving down a
concentration or electrochemical gradient with no
expenditure of metabolic energy. Passive transport, in
the same direction as a concentration gradient, can
occur spontaneously, or proteins can mediate passive
transport and provide the pathway for this movement
across the lipid bilayer without supplying energy for
the action. These proteins are called channels if they
mediate ions and permeases if they mediate large
molecules. This type of transport always operates from
regions of greater concentration to regions of lesser
concentration.
See also ACTIVE TRANSPORT.
260
parasitoid

pattern formation
The direction given to cells to
form a specific three-dimensional structure in shaping
the development of an organism and its parts.
pattern recognition
The identification of patterns in
large data sets using appropriate mathematical method-
ologies.
Pavlov, Ivan Petrovich (1849–1936) Russian Physi-
ologist
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov was born on September
14, 1849, in Ryazan, to Peter Dmitrievich Pavlov, a vil-
lage priest. He was educated first at the church school
in Ryazan, the Ryazan Ecclesiastical High School, and
then at the local theological seminary.
Pavlov abandoned religion for science when he
was inspired by the progressive ideas of the Russian
literary critic D. I. Pisarev, by Ivan M. Sechenov, the
father of Russian physiology, and by the works of
Charles Darwin. In 1870 he enrolled in the physics
and mathematics faculty to take the course in natural
science.
Pavlov became interested in physiology. While tak-
ing the course in natural science, he and a fellow stu-
dent wrote a treatise on the physiology of the
pancreatic nerves that won wide acclaim, and Pavlov
was awarded a gold medal.
In 1875 Pavlov received the degree of candidate of
natural sciences. However, his overwhelming interest in
physiology forced him to continue his studies and
attend the Academy of Medical Surgery. Pavlov won a
fellowship at the academy, and with a position as direc-
tor of the physiological laboratory at the clinic of the
famous Russian clinician, S. P. Botkin, he was able to
continue his research work. In 1881 Pavlov married
Seraphima (Sara) Vasilievna Karchevskaya, a teacher,
the daughter of a doctor. They had four sons and a
daughter. In 1883 he presented his thesis, entitled “The
centrifugal nerves of the heart,” and laid down the
basic principles on the trophic function of the nervous
system. Pavlov showed that there existed a basic pat-
tern in the reflex regulation of the activity of the circu-
latory organs.
In 1890 Pavlov organized and directed the depart-
ment of physiology at the Institute of Experimental
Medicine and spent the next 45 years making it one of
the most important centers of physiological research.
Also, in 1890 he was appointed professor of pharma-
cology at the Military Medical Academy, and five years
later he was appointed to the then-vacant chair of
physiology, which he held until 1925.
Between the years 1891 and 1900, Pavlov did
the bulk of his research on the physiology of diges-
tion at the Institute of Experimental Medicine and
demonstrated that the nervous system played the
dominant part in regulating the digestive process.
Pavlov promoted his research in lectures that he
delivered in 1895 and published under the title Lekt-
sii o rabote glavnykh pishchevaritelnyteh zhelez
(Lectures on the function of the principal digestive
glands) in 1897.
His research on the physiology of digestion led to
the development of the first experimental model of
learning, called classical conditioning. Pavlov’s research
into the physiology of digestion led to the study of con-
ditioned reflexes. In a now-classic experiment, he
trained a hungry dog to salivate at the sound of a bell,
which was previously associated with the sight of food.
He implanted small stomach pouches in dogs to mea-
sure the secretion of gastric juices produced when the
dogs began to eat.
In 1901 he was elected a corresponding member of
the Russian Academy of Sciences, and in 1904 he was
awarded a Nobel Prize for his work in digestion. In
1907 he was elected academician of the Russian Acade-
my of Sciences, and in 1912 he was given an honorary
doctorate at Cambridge University. He held many other
honorary memberships of various scientific societies
abroad. Finally, upon the recommendation of the Med-
ical Academy of Paris, he was awarded the Order of
the Legion of Honor (1915).
After the Russian Revolution, a special government
decree signed by Lenin on January 24, 1921, noted
“the outstanding scientific services of Academician I. P.
Pavlov, which are of enormous significance to the
working class of the whole world.”
The Communist Party and the Soviet government
gave Pavlov and his collaborators unlimited scope for
scientific research and built him a laboratory. Pavlov
summarized his discoveries in his book, Conditioned
Reflexes. Pavlov died in Leningrad on February 27,
1936.

The line of descent; a documented list or
table of ancestors, as in a genealogical record of an ani-
mal or person.
pelagic zone
The ocean is divided into zones. The
whole mass of water is called the pelagic. This is divid-
ed into two major subzones: the neritic zone, which
covers all water to a depth of 600 feet, and the oceanic
zone, which covers all water below 600 feet. The
oceanic zone is further divided into subzones. The
mesopelagic (semidark waters) covers the depths from
650 feet to 3,200 feet, which is the middle layer
between the upper (sunlit 650 feet) epipelagic and the
lower (cold and dark) bathypelagic.

linked by amino acid bridges that are found only in
the cell walls of bacteria. This elaborate, covalently
cross-linked structure provides great strength of the
cell wall.
peptidomimetic
A compound containing nonpep-
tidic structural elements that is capable of mimicking or

leishmaniasis. Here, the macrophage has extended part of its body
to surround and capture the Leishmania. This process is called
phagocytosis. Leishmaniasis is transmitted by the bites of infected
sandflies, causing a skin ulcer at the site of the bite. The more
serious form, kala-azar, can be fatal. Macrophages are part of the
immune system that keep the body free of invading organisms.

sary to ensure the optimal supramolecular interactions
with a specific biological target structure and to trigger
(or to block) its biological response.
A
pharmacophore does not represent a real
molecule or a real association of functional groups
but, rather, is a purely abstract concept that accounts
for the common molecular interaction capacities of a
group of compounds toward their target structure.
The pharmacophore can be considered as the largest
common denominator shared by a set of active
molecules. This definition discards a misuse often
found in the MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY literature, which
consists of naming as pharmacophores simple chemi-
cal functionalities such as guanidines, sulfonamides,
or dihydroimidazoles (formerly imidazolines), or typi-
cal structural skeletons such as flavones, phenoth-
iazines, prostaglandins, or steroids.
pharmacophoric descriptors

PHARMACOPHORE, including H-bonding and hydropho-
bic and electrostatic interaction sites, defined by atoms,
ring centers, and virtual points.
pharynx
A short section of fibromuscular tube that
is the common opening for the digestive and respira-
tory systems. Located in the throat at the convergence
of the nasal passage and oral cavity it opens to the
larynx (respiratory system) and the esophagus (diges-
tive system). Composed of three parts: the nasophar-
ynx (behind the nose and above the soft palate;
tonsils), the oropharynx (back of the mouth and soft
palate, tonsils, and posterior third of the tongue wall
of the throat), and the hypopharynx or laryngophar-
ynx (lower part of the throat behind the larynx and
above the esophagus). The pharynx receives air from
the nasal cavity, while air, food, and water enter from
the mouth.
phenetics (numerical taxonomy)
A former school of
taxonomy that classified organisms on the basis of
overall morphological or genetic similarity that
involved observable similarities and differences with-
out considering whether or not the organisms were
related. It involved clustering groups into types and
represented a nonphylogenetic approach to biological
classification.
phenotype
The outward observable features, func-
tions, or behaviors of an organism, based on the coding
of the genotype.
See also GENOTYPE.
pheromone
A volatile chemical secreted and sent
externally by an organism to send information to mem-
bers of the same species via olfactory senses that induce
a physiological or behavioral response, such as sexual
attraction.
phloem
The principal food-conducting living tissue
of vascular plants; one of the vascular tissues in plants,
the other being the xylem, that make up the vascular
bundle. Composed of food-conducting sieve elements:
sieve cells and sieve-tube members. Sieve cells are found
in gymnosperms, while angiosperms have sieve-tube
members.
See also XYLEM.
phosphatase
An ENZYME that catalyzes the hydrolysis
of orthophosphoric monoesters. Alkaline phosphatases
(EC 3.1.3.1) have an optimum pH above 7 and are zinc-
containing proteins. Acid phosphatases (EC 3.1.3.2)
have an optimum pH below 7, and some of these con-
tain a dinuclear center of iron, or iron and zinc.

phosphate group
Oxygenated phosphorus (–PO4)
that is attached to a carbon chain; important in energy
transfer from ATP in cell signal transduction, the bio-
chemical communication from one part of the cell to
another; also part of a DNA nucleotide.
phospholipase A (phosphatide acylhydrolase)

tion, while phospholipase A2 hydrolyzes the acyl group
attached to the 2-position.
phospholipases
A class of enzymes that catalyze the
hydrolysis of phosphoglycerides or glycerophosphati-
dates.
phospholipids
The main component of cell walls; an
amphiphilic molecule (lipid). A glycerol skeleton is
attached to two fatty acids and a phosphate group, and
onto the phosphate is attached one of three nitrogen
groups, so both phosphate and nitrogen groups make
the “polar head” larger and more polar. The phosphate
part of the molecule is water soluble, while the fatty
acid chains are fat soluble. The phospholipids have a
polar hydrophilic head (phosphate) and nonpolar
hydrophobic tail (fatty acids). When in water, phospho-
lipids sort into spherical bilayers; the phosphate groups
point to the cell exterior and interior, while the fatty
acid groups point to the interior of the membrane.
Examples include lecithin, cephalin and sphin-
gomyelin, phosphatidic acid, plasmalogen. Two types
of phospholipids exist: glycerophospholipid and sphin-
gosyl 
phosphatide. 
A 
synthetic 
phospholipid,
alkylphosphocholine, has been used in biological and
therapeutic areas.
Structurally, phospholipids are similar to triglyc-
erides, except that a phosphate group replaces one of
the fatty acids.
phosphorylation
A process involving the transfer 
of a phosphate group (catalyzed by ENZYMEs) from 
a donor to a suitable acceptor; in general, an ester link-
age is formed, for example: ATP + alcohol   ADP +
phosphate ester
photic zone
The upper layer within bodies of water,
reaching down to about 200 meters, where sunlight
penetrates and promotes the production of photosyn-
thesis; the richest and most diverse area of the ocean. A
region where photosynthetic floating creatures (phyto-
plankton) are primary producers as well as a major
food source. The littoral zone and much of the sublit-
toral zone fall within the photic zone.
photoautotroph
An organism that uses sunlight to
provide energy and uses carbon dioxide as the chief
source of carbon, such as photosynthetic bacteria,
cyanobacteria, algae. Green plants are photoau-
totrophs.
photoheterotroph
Like photoautotrophs, any organ-
ism that uses light as a source of energy but must use
organic compounds as a source of carbon, for example,
green and purple nonsulfur bacteria.
photolysis
A light-induced bond cleavage. The term is
often used incorrectly to describe irradiation of a sample.

gy emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation. A
particle of light and gamma and X rays are examples.
photoperiodism
The 
physiological 
response 
to
length of day and night in a 24-hour period, such as
the flowering or budding in plants.
photophosphorylation
The process of creating
adenosine 5-triphosphate (ATP) from ADP and phos-
phate by using the energy of the sun. Takes place in the
thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts.
photorespiration
A process that decreases photo-
synthesis and occurs when carbon dioxide levels are
low inside a plant’s leaves; a process that uses oxygen,
releases carbon dioxide, and generates no ATP in the
process. Occurs on hot days when oxygen concentra-
tions in leaves exceed carbon dioxide levels due to
closed stomata.
photosynthesis
A metabolic process in plants and
certain bacteria that uses light energy absorbed by
CHLOROPHYLL and other photosynthetic pigments for
the reduction of CO2, followed by the formation of
organic compounds.

photosystem
A membrane-bound protein complex
in plants and photosynthetic bacteria, responsible for
light harvesting and primary electron transfer. Com-
prises light-harvesting pigments such as CHLOROPHYLL;
a primary electron-transfer center and a secondary 
electron carrier. In green-plant photosynthesis, photo-
system I transfers electrons from PLASTOCYANIN to 
a [2FE-2S]
FERREDOXIN and contains IRON-SULFUR
PROTEINS. Photosystem II transfers electrons from the
OXYGEN-EVOLVING
COMPLEX to plastoquinone and
contains an iron center.

phototropism
Growth movement by plants that is
induced by light. If growth is toward the light source it
is called positive phototropism; if it is away from the
source it is termed negative phototropism.
pH scale
The concentration of hydrogen ions in a
solution, based on a scale from 0 to 14. Low pH corre-
sponds to high hydrogen ion concentration, and high
pH refers to low hydrogen concentration. A substance
added to water that increases the concentration of
hydrogen ions (i.e., lowers the pH) is called an acid,
while a substance that reduces the concentration of
hydrogen ions (i.e., raises the pH) is called a base. Acid
in the stomach has a pH of 1, while a liquid drainer
has a pH of 14. Pure water is neutral with a pH of 7.
Compounds called buffers can be added to a solution
that will resist pH changes when an acid or base is
added.
See also ACID; BASE.
phylogeny
The evolutionary tree that connects a
group of organisms.
phylum
A taxonomic category between kingdom
and class.
See also TAXON.
phytoalexin
A toxic substance that acts like an
antibiotic that is produced by plants to inhibit or kill
the growth of microorganisms, such as certain fungi
that would otherwise infect them; e.g., pisatin (pro-
duced by peas), phaseollin (produced by beans [Phase-
olus]), camalexin (produced by Arabidopsis thaliana),
resveratrol (grapes).
phytochelatin
A peptide of higher plants consisting
of polymers of 2–11 glutathione (γ, glutamyl, cysteinyl,
glycine) groups, which binds heavy metals.
phytochrome (red-light-sensitive system)
Photore-
ceptor proteins that regulate light-dependent growth
processes; absorbs red and far-red light in a reversible
system; one of the two light-sensing systems involved
in photoperiodism and photomorphogenesis. Plant
responses 
regulated 
by 
phytochrome 
include 
photoperiodic induction of flowering, chloroplast
development (minus chlorophyll synthesis), leaf
senescence, leaf abscission, seed germination, and
flower induction.
picket-fence porphyrin
A PORPHYRIN with a pro-
tective enclosure for binding oxygen at one side of the
ring that is used to mimic the dioxygen-carrying prop-
erties of the HEME group.
See also BIOMIMETIC.
pilus
A hairlike projection, composed of a protein
pilin and found on the surface of certain gram-negative
bacteria, that functions to adhere to carbohydrate
receptors on host cells. Specialized sex pili conjugate
with other bacteria to transfer DNA. Also called fim-
briae.
pineal gland 
(pineal body; epiphysis)
A
small
endocrine gland shaped like a pine cone and located in
the middle of the brain. It functions as a regulator of the
biological clock. At night, the hormone serotonin con-
verts into melatonin (n-acetyl-5-methoxy-tryptamine
[NA-5-MT]) by enzymatic interaction. Melatonin is a
neurotransmitter and neurohormone.
The pineal helps to regulate the function of all
organs of the endocrine system in the body (pituitary
gland, thyroid + parathyroid glands, thymus, pancreas,
pineal gland
267

and ovaries/testes) that secrete their hormones to the
blood. The pituitary gland stimulates the secretion of
these hormones, but the pineal gland stops it via mela-
tonin. If there is too much hormone, the pineal releases
melatonin to counteract; too much stress in the body,
serotonin triggers the release of adrenaline. The pineal
is also sensitive to light, and it releases melatonin at
night and is inhibited during the day.
New studies regarding the effect of electromagnetic
frequency (EMF) on the body (from cell phones, high
voltage lines, etc.) also relates to the pineal gland,
which is sensitive to EMF and seems to suppress the
activity of the pineal gland by reducing melatonin pro-
duction.
The pineal gland is suspected to play a role in a
number of problems including cancer, sexual dysfunc-
tion, hypertension, and the decline in melatonin has
been suggested to be a trigger for the aging process.
pinocytosis
An active transport process by which
liquids or very small particles are ingested into the cell
by endocytosis. The cytoplasmic membrane invaginates
(forms “pockets”), fills with liquid or material, and
pinches off into a pinocytic vesicle or vacuole that can
then be transported.
pith
The core of plant stems; location of vascular sys-
tems containing parenchyma cells and ground tissue.
Also to kill by severing the spinal cord.
pituitary gland
A two-lobed, pea-size gland at the
base of the brain and attached to the hypothalamus
that controls the endocrine system. The major divisions
of the gland are the anterior lobe, or adenohypophysis,
and the posterior lobe, the neurohypophysis. Each lobe
produces hormones. The anterior lobe produces
growth 
hormone, 
thyroid-stimulating 
hormone,
adrenocorticotropic hormone, prolactin, luteinizing
hormone (LH), and follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH), the last two called gonadotropins because they
stimulate the gonads. The posterior lobe releases anti-
diuretic hormone (vasopressin) and oxytocin. These
hormones regulate many body functions from growth
to birth contractions.
placebo
An inert substance or dosage form that is
identical in appearance, flavor, and odor to the active
substance or dosage form. It is used as a negative con-
trol in a BIOASSAY or in a clinical study.
placenta
A structure that develops in the uterus dur-
ing pregnancy that provides a blood supply and nutri-
ents for the fetus and eliminates waste; formed from
the uterine lining and embryonic membranes. In
humans, it is also referred to as the afterbirth because it
is ejected after the baby in a normal vaginal birth. If the
placenta is abnormally low in the uterus and covering
the uterus, a pregnancy-related condition called placen-
ta praevia occurs and usually necessitates delivery by a
cesarean section.
placental mammal
Any mammals that bear their
young live and are nourished before birth in the moth-
er’s uterus through a placenta. There are about 4,000
species, from bats to cats to humans.
placoderm
A member of an extinct class of early
hinged-jaw fishlike vertebrates covered with a tough
outer body armor of bony plates with paired fins; lived
during the Silurian and Devonian periods (438 to 360
million years ago). Examples include the antiarchs and
dinichthyids.
plankton
Plankton 
includes 
mostly 
small-sized
plants called phytoplankton (e.g., diatoms) and ani-
mals called zooplankton (e.g., radiolarians) that drift
and float along with the tides and currents of water
bodies. Their name comes from the Greek meaning
“drifter” or “wanderer.” Phytoplankton produce their
own food by photosynthesis and are primary produc-
ers and food supply for a host of other organisms.
Plankton are also an oxygen producer, generating
according to some estimates as much as 80 percent of
the Earth’s oxygen supply.
planula
The free-swimming, flat, ciliated larvae of
the coelenterates.
268
pinocytosis

plasma
In biology, this term has the following three
meanings:
1. Fluid component of blood in which the blood cells
and platelets are suspended (blood plasma). Note
the distinction between plasma, which describes a
part of the blood (the fluid part of blood, outside
the blood cells), and serum, which describes a frac-
tion derived from blood by a manipulation (the fluid
that separates when blood coagulates).
2. Fluid component of semen produced by the accesso-
ry glands, the seminal vesicles, the prostate, and the
bulbourethral gland.
3. Cell substance outside the nucleus (CYTOPLASM).
plasma cell
An antibody-producing B cell that has
reached the end of its differentiation pathway. B cells
are white blood cells that develop from B stem cells
into plasma cells that produce immunoglobulins (anti-
bodies).
plasma membrane
An interface and permeability-
limiting membrane composed of lipids and proteins
that act as a selective barrier for the cell’s interior cyto-
plasm.
plasmid
An extrachromosomal 
GENETIC
element
consisting generally of circular double-stranded DNA,
which can replicate independently of chromosomal
DNA. R plasmids are responsible for the mutual trans-
fer of antibiotic resistance among microbes. Plasmids
are used as vectors for CLONING DNA in bacteria or
yeast host cells.
See also CLONING VECTOR.
plasmodesma
Living bridges between cell walls;
small tubes or openings lined with plasma membrane
between cell walls that connect each cell to one another
and are believed to allow molecules to pass through.
plasmogamy
A process of cytoplasm fusion between
two cells; the first step in syngamy (sexual reproduction).
plasmolysis
A process caused by diffusion when the
cell membrane shrinks away from its cell wall, with 
the resulting vacuole and cytoplasm shrinking due to
the presence of a foreign material, like salt, becoming
too abundant; water is drawn from the cell into the
extracellular area, and the cell becomes flaccid after
losing its internal turgor.
plastid
A type of plant cytoplasmic organelle that
develops from a precursor small and colorless undiffer-
entiated organelle, the proplastid. During cell differentia-
tion, proplastids differentiate into particular plastid
types according to the type of cell in which they are
located in response to the particular metabolic demands.
Plastids are essential components for plant cell function.
Plastids develop into specialized functional types.
They divide by binary fission or budding. Several types
of plastids exist: amyloplast or leucoplast (starch syn-
thesis and storage), chloroplast (photosynthesis), chro-
moplast (plant color), etioplast (night plants, can
develop chloroplasts), proteoplast or proteinoplast
(storage), elaioplast (oil storage).
plastocyanin
An ELECTRON TRANSFER PROTEIN, con-
taining a TYPE 1 COPPER site, involved in plant and
cyanobacterial PHOTOSYNTHESIS, which transfers elec-
trons to PHOTOSYSTEM I.
platelet (thrombocyte)
Disk-shaped, colorless blood
cells produced by the bone marrow (from megakary-
ocytes); contains numerous proinflammatory mediators
and functions to stop bleeding and allow damaged
areas 
to 
clot. 
A 
normal 
platelet 
count 
is
150,000–400,000 mm3 (millimeters cubed).
See also BLOOD.
platelet-activating factor (PAF)
A cytokine media-
tor of immediate hypersensitivity, perhaps even the
most important, which produces inflammation.
pleated sheet (beta pleated sheet)
One type of sever-
al secondary structures, the three-dimensional arrange-
pleated sheet
269

ments (folding, twisting, coiling) of polypeptide chains
in a protein. They can be in the form of a helix, ran-
dom coil, or pleated sheet; linked by hydrogen bonds in
the peptide backbone; sheets are formed when the
polypeptide chains fold back and forth, or when two
parts are parallel to each other and bonded; also called
the beta pleated sheet.
pleiotropy
The ability of a single gene to affect many
phenotypic traits. Jonathan Hodgkin from the MRC
Laboratory of Molecular Biology, in Cambridge, Unit-
ed Kingdom, has characterized several types of
pleiotropy:
Artefactual
Adjacent but functionally unrelated genes
affected by the same mutation, e.g., claret.
Secondary
Simple primary biochemical disorder lead-
ing to complex final phenotype, e.g., phenylke-
tonurea.
Adoptive
One gene product used for quite different
chemical purposes in different tissues, e.g., e-crys-
tallin.
Parsimonious
One gene product used for identical
chemical purposes in multiple pathways, e.g., gpb-1.
Opportunistic
One gene product playing a secondary
role in addition to its main function, e.g., sisB/
AS-C.
Combinatorial
One gene product employed in vari-
ous ways, and with distinct properties, depending on
its different protein partners, e.g., unc-86.
Unifying
One gene, or cluster of adjacent genes,
encoding multiple chemical activities that support a
common biological function, e.g., cha-1 unc-17.
plesiomorphic character
The ancestral character of
a homologue; the descendant character is termed the
apomorphic character. Two characters in two taxa are
homologues if they are the same as the character that is
found in the ancestry of the two taxa, or if they have
characters that have an ancestor/descendant relation-
ship described as preexisting or novel (plesiomorphic
and apomorphic character).
All taxa are mixtures of ancestral and derived char-
acters. Ancestral character states are those similar to
the remote ancestor, while derived characters are those
that have undergone recent change. Taxa can show
either the ancestral (or plesiomorphic) character state
or the derived (apomorphic) character state for a par-
ticular character.
pluripotent stem cell (stem cell)
Primitive blood
cells found in the bone marrow, circulating blood-
stream, and umbilical cord that are capable of repro-
ducing and differentiating to make all varieties of
mature blood cells (white blood cells, red blood cells,
and platelets). This means that all blood cells originate
from this single type of cell. Pluripotent stem cells are
usually referred to as stem cells.
pneumatophore (breathing roots)
A specialized root
structure that has numerous pores or lenticels over its
surface, allowing gas exchange, and that grows up into
the air, e.g., mangroves.
pocosin
A swamp on the coastal plain of the south-
eastern United States.
poikilotherm
An organism (e.g., fish or reptile)
whose body temperature varies or fluctuates with the
temperature of its surroundings; an ectotherm.
point mutation
When the base sequence of a codon
is permanently changed. Four types exist:
Missense
A change in base sequence converts a codon
for one amino acid to a codon for a different amino
acid.
Nonsense
A codon for a specific amino acid is 
converted to a chain-terminating codon.
Silent
Conversion of a codon for an amino acid to
another codon that specifies the same amino acid.
Frameshift
A nucleotide is deleted or added to the
coding portion of a gene.
poison plants (poison ivy; poison oak; poison sumac)
The poison ivy plant is known as Toxicodendron radi-
cans in the eastern United States and T. rydbergii in 
the midwestern United States. Historically it has been
270
pleiotropy

called Rhus toxicodendron. Western poison oak is
known as Toxicodendron diversilobum.
These plants can cause a skin reaction. No reaction
usually occurs the first time the skin is exposed to the
plant. Subsequent contact with the plant or plant resin,
however, can result in an allergic skin reaction that
usually appears seven to 14 days after contact. Subse-
quent contact results in a more rapid reaction, usually
within two to five days postcontact. The severity of the
reaction is related to the amount of plant material that
comes in contact with the skin, as well as to the degree
of allergic sensitivity of the individual. The allergen
(irritant from the plant) is often transferred from the
hands or clothing to other parts of the body.
The poison ivy plant and its relatives are common
throughout the United States. Poison ivy leaves are coat-
ed with a mixture of chemicals called urushiol. When
people get urushiol on their skin, it causes allergic con-
tact dermatitis. The body’s immune system treats urushi-
ol as foreign and attacks the complex of urushiol
derivatives with skin proteins. The irony is that urushiol,
in the absence of the immune attack, would be harmless.
Poison ivy can affect two out of three Americans,
and of these, 15 percent may have severe allergic reac-
tions that require medical treatment. Millions of Amer-
icans yearly seek remedies for the irritation caused by
poison ivy, oak, and sumac.
polar covalent bond
A type of chemical bond,
based on electron affinity, where electrons shared by
atoms spend a greater percentage of time closer to an
oxygen nucleus rather than a hydrogen nucleus; bonds
are polar, i.e., they have a partial electric charge across
the molecule due to their geometry and the electronega-
tivity difference between the two atoms (hydrogen is
positive, oxygen is negative); in organisms, they can
form weak hydrogen bonds. Water is an example, but
peptide bonds and amines also form polar covalent
bonds; these molecules can attract each other.
polar molecule
A molecule that has both a positive
and a negative end, such as water.
pollen
Microscopic grains produced by plants in
order to reproduce. Each plant has a pollinating period
that can vary depending on the plant, climate, and
region.
pollen allergy
A hypersensitive reaction to pollen.
While grass pollens are generally the most common
cause of hay fever (seasonal allergic rhinitis), other
pollen types are also important. These include tree pol-
lens such as alder, hazel, birch, beech, cypress, pine,
chestnut, and poplar, and weed pollens such as plan-
tain, mugwort, and ragweed. The relative importance
of the kinds of pollen that can cause hay fever varies
between different climatic and vegetation zones. For
example, ragweed pollen, although very common in
North America, is present in Europe only in the French
Rhône valley and some areas of Eastern Europe, while
the pollen most associated with seasonal allergy in
Mediterranean regions is the olive tree. A person aller-
gic to one pollen is generally also allergic to members
of the same group or family (e.g., Betulaceae). Pollen-
induced reactions include extrinsic asthma, rhinitis,
and bronchitis.
pollination
The first step in plant reproduction.
Occurs when the male germ cell of a plant, a pollen
grain, reaches the female reproductive part, or stigma,
of the same species of plant. This happens by wind
transportation or by animal carriers, although 90 per-
cent of flowering plants rely on animal delivery.
polyandry
A rare mating system where one female
mates with more than one male, although each male
mates with only one female. Two types of polyandry
exist: simultaneous polyandry, where each female
maintains a large territory that contains smaller nesting
territories of two or more males who care for the eggs
and tend to the young; and sequential polyandry, where
a female mates with a male, lays eggs, and terminates
the relationship and leaves that male. While the male is
left to incubate the eggs, she repeats the sequence with
another male. The latter is more common. In human
society, it is the practice of a woman to have more than
one husband at a time.
polydentate
See CHELATION; DONOR ATOM SYMBOL.
polydentate
271

polygenic inheritance
The interaction of several
genes on a phenotype trait. A series of genes at multiple
loci where each contributes a small additive effect on a
plant’s phenotype, for example, height in tobacco plants.
polygyny
A mating system where one male mates
with more than one female, while each female mates
with only one male; believed to be the normal mating
system in animals.
polyhedral symbol
The polyhedral symbol indicates
the geometrical arrangements of the coordinating
atoms about the CENTRAL ATOM. It consists of one or
more capital italic letters derived from common geo-
metric terms (tetrahedron, square plane, octahedron,
etc.), which denote the idealized geometry of the LIG-
ANDs around the COORDINATION center, and an Arabic
numeral that is the coordination number of the central
atom. The polyhedral symbol is used as an affix,
enclosed in parentheses, and separated from the name
by a hyphen. Examples are T-4, SP-4, TBPY-5, SPY-5,
OC-6, and CU-8.
polymer
A macromolecule of high relative molecular
mass composed of many similar or identical monomers
linked together in chains. Plastics are polymers.
polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
A
laboratory
technique used to rapidly amplify predetermined
regions of double-stranded DNA. Generally involves
the use of a heat-stable DNA polymerase.
polymorphic
Refers to a phenotypic expression
occurring in a number of forms appearing within an
interbreeding population, such as fur coloration.
polymorphism
Difference in DNA sequence among
individuals in a plant or animal population expressed
as two or more distinct forms of individuals in the
same population. Polymorphisms can be inherited or
environmentally 
created 
(polyphenism). 
Examples
include sickle cell anemia and the caste system of bees.
polymorphonuclear 
leukocyte (PMN; 
granular
leukocyte; granulocyte; inflammatory granulocyte;
polymorphonuclear cell)
A subgroup of leukocytes
(white blood cells) filled with granules of toxic chemi-
cals that enable them to digest microorganisms by
phagocytosis. Examples of granulocytes are neu-
trophils, eosinophils, and basophils.

polyp
A cnidarian body form that is the sessile
reproductive stage; the alternate is the mobile medusa
stage. In medicine, a polyp is a small stalked benign
growth or tumor protruding from a mucous mem-
brane; can be precursors of cancer.
polypeptide
A polymer chain of amino acids linked
by covalent peptide bonds. One or more polypeptides
form proteins. Each polypeptide has two terminal ends;
one, called the amino terminal or N-terminal, has a free
amino group, while the other end is called the carboxyl
terminal or C-terminal with a free carboxyl group.
polyphyletic
Refers to a group of organisms that
might have some similarities but that do not include the
most recent common ancestor of all the member organ-
isms due to that ancestor lacking some or all character-
istics of the group. Polyphyletic groups are
not
recognized in accepted taxonomies.
polyploidy
When the number of chromosomes in a
cell gets doubled; two complete chromosome sets; a
mutation. Polyploidy is very common in plants, where
30 percent to 70 percent of modern angiosperms are
believed to be polyploids. Polyploidy is rare in animals
but is found in some insects, amphibians, reptiles, and
one mammal (a rat in Argentina).
polyribosome (polysome)
A
cluster of ribosomes
translating on one messenger RNA molecule.
polysaccharide
A carbohydrate (polymer) made by
polymerizing any of more than 1,000 monosaccha-
rides; a complex sugar.
population
Any group of interbreeding individuals of
a particular species living in a specific geographic area.
population viability analysis (PVA)
A process to
evaluate the likelihood of a population surviving and to
identify threats facing the species. Used in endangered
species recovery and management.
porins
A class of proteins that create water-filled
channels across cell membranes.
porphyrin
A macrocyclic molecule that contains
four pyrrole rings linked together by single carbon
atom bridges between the alpha positions of the pyr-
role rings. Porphyrins usually occur in their dianionic
form coordinated to a metal ion.
See also COORDINATION.
positional information
Cells send signals indicating
their locations relative to each other in the embryo
development process; positional information is commu-
nicated through gap junctions, specific cell-cell adhe-
sions, or diffusible signal molecules; part of the process
of determining cell fate.
positive feedback
When a change occurs in a vari-
able during homeostasis, the response is to reinforce
the change in the variable. Examples include nerve
impulse conduction, blood clotting, female ovarian
cycles, labor and birth, and immune responses. A
resulting NEGATIVE FEEDBACK may need to take over to
halt the process.
postsynaptic membrane
The presynaptic mem-
brane is at the tip of each nerve ending. A small cleft
called the synaptic cleft separates the presynaptic
membrane from the postsynaptic membrane, a special
area on the receiving cell. When the presynaptic nerve
ending receives nerve impulses, it sends neurotransmit-
ters stored in synaptic vesicles into the synaptic cleft
(the synapse), which in turn diffuse across and trans-
mit the signal to the postsynaptic membrane receptor
molecules, which are specialized molecules that open
or close certain ion channels when activated by the
correct neurotransmitter.
postzygotic barrier
A species-isolating mechanism
preventing hybrids that are produced by two 
different species from developing into fertile and
viable adults.
See also PREZYGOTIC BARRIER.
postzygotic barrier
273

potency
A comparative rather than an absolute
expression of drug activity. Drug potency depends on
both AFFINITY and EFFICACY. Thus, two AGONISTs can
be equipotent but have different intrinsic efficacies,
with compensating differences in affinity. Potency is the
dose of DRUG required to produce a specific effect of
given intensity as compared with a standard reference.
potential energy
Stored energy that can be released
or harnessed to do work.
power saturation
A phenomenon used in ELECTRON
PARAMAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY to estimate
the electron-spin relaxation times, thus providing infor-
mation about distances between PARAMAGNETIC centers.
predator
An animal that preys on or eats other 
animals.
predisposition, genetic
A latent susceptibility to
disease, at the genetic level, that can be activated under
certain conditions.
prevalence
The number of all new and old cases of a
disease in a defined population at a particular point in
time.
prezygotic barrier
There are two types of reproduc-
tive isolation mechanisms: prezygotic (before gamete
union) and postzygotic (after gamete union). A form of
prezygotic barrier is mechanical isolation, which deals
with the mechanics of the reproductive organs and
physically prevents sexual intercourse between two dif-
ferent species. Temporal (two species reproduce at dif-
ferent times of day) and habitat isolation (two
overlapping species in same range live in different habi-
tats) are also prezygotic barriers.
See also POSTZYGOTIC BARRIER.
primary consumer
Any animal that eats grass, algae,
and other green plants in a food chain; a herbivore.
primary germ layers
After gastrulation, develop-
ment of the three germ layers—ectoderm, mesoderm,
endoderm—occurs, and these eventually develop into
all parts of the animal.
primary growth
Growth initiated by the apical
meristem that takes place relatively close to the tips of
roots and stem and that involves extending the length
of the plant.
primary immune response
The immune response
(cellular or humoral) to a first encounter with an anti-
gen. The primary response is generally small, has a long
induction phase or lag period, consists primarily of IgM
antibodies, and generates immunologic memory.
primary producer
An autotroph that acts as a food
source for the next level up in the food chain. Green
plants are primary producers.
primary productivity
The rate at which new plant
biomass is formed by photosynthesis. Gross primary
productivity is the total rate of photosynthetic produc-
tion of biomass; net primary productivity is gross pri-
mary productivity minus the respiration rate.
primary structure
The amino acid SEQUENCE of a
protein or the NUCLEOTIDE sequence of DNA or RNA.
primary 
succession
Occurs 
when 
communities
develop in a newly exposed habitat that had no former
life (e.g., bare rock, newly deposited sand).
primate
Mammals that include humans and other
species that are closely related. There are two main
groups: the anthropoids (humans, apes, monkeys) and
prosimians (aye-ayes, galagos, lemurs, lorises, pottos,
and tarsiers).
primer
A short preexisting polynucleotide chain to
which new deoxyribonucleotides can be added by
DNA polymerase.
274
potency

primordial germ cells
Fetal cells that develop in the
early fetus and that will develop into the gametes, the
male sperm or female eggs.
principle of allocation
Each organism has a limited,
finite energy budget that is used for living out its life
processes of growth, reproduction, obtaining nutrients,
predator flight, and adjusting to environmental
changes.
prion
The smallest infectious particle known
(though its existence is challenged by some scientists),
consisting of hydrophobic protein without any nucle-
ic acid. There are a number of prion-caused diseases.
Scrapie, found in sheep and goats, causes those ani-
mals to lose coordination, and eventually they
become incapacitated and develop an intense itch
that leads them to scrape off their wool or hair
(hence the name “scrapie”). Other diseases are trans-
missible mink encephalopathy, chronic wasting dis-
ease of mule deer and elk, feline spongiform
encephalopathy, and bovine spongiform encephalopa-
thy (mad cow disease). Kuru has been seen among the
Fore highlanders tribesmen of Papua New Guinea,
the result of cannibalism (but has almost disap-
peared). Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease affects one person
in a million. The other two human prion diseases are
Gerstmann–Straussler–Scheinker disease and fatal
familial insomnia.
probability
The statistical measure of an event’s like-
lihood.
procambium
A primary meristem tissue that differ-
entiates into the vascular bundle and vascular tissues
(xylem and phloem).
prodrug
Any compound that undergoes BIOTRANS-
FORMATION
before
exhibiting its pharmacological
effects. Prodrugs can thus be viewed as DRUGs contain-
ing specialized nontoxic protective groups used in a
transient manner to alter or to eliminate undesirable
properties in the parent molecule.
See also DOUBLE PRODRUG.
prognosis
Prediction of the future course of a disease.
prokaryote
A unicellular organism characterized by
the absence of a membrane-bound nucleus.
See also EUKARYOTES.
promoter
The DNA region, usually upstream from
the coding SEQUENCE of a GENE or OPERON, that binds
and directs RNA polymerase to the correct transcrip-
tional start site and thus permits TRANSCRIPTION at a
specific initiation site. (In catalysis, a promoter is used
differently: a cocatalyst usually present in much smaller
amounts than the catalyst.)

infects bacteria) chromosome that has been inserted
on a specific part of the DNA chromosome of a 
bacterium.

prophase
During prophase, the chromosomes are
identical chromatids that are connected at the center by
a centromere (x-shaped). The mitotic spindle, which is
used to maneuver the chromosomes about the cell, is
formed from excess parts of cytoskeleton and initially
set up outside the nucleus.
The cell’s centrioles are then duplicated to form
two pairs of centrioles, with each pair becoming a part
of the mitotic center forming the focus for the aster, an
array of microtubules. The two asters lie side by side
and close to the nuclear envelope while near the end of
prophase; the asters then pull apart and the spindle is
formed.
prophylaxis
Measures taken (treatment, drugs) to
prevent the onset of a particular disease (primary pro-
phylaxis) or recurrent symptoms in an existing infec-
tion that have been brought under control (secondary
prophylaxis, maintenance therapy). Preventive treat-
ment. Treatment intended to preserve health and pre-
vent the occurrence or recurrence of a disease. Taking a
drug to prevent yourself from getting an illness.
Chemoprophylaxis is prevention of disease by chemical
means.
proprioreceptor
Part of the sensory system. A sense
organ that detects the relative position about body
positions and movement.
prostaglandin (PG)
A lipid mediator, synthesized by
the action of the enzyme phospholipase A2, which
breaks down cell membrane components into arachi-
donic acid and then into prostaglandin by cyclooxyge-
nase. Highly proinflammatory, bronchospastic, and
vasodilatory.
prosthetic group
A tightly bound, specific non-
polypeptide unit in a protein that determines and is
involved in its biological activity.
See also COFACTOR.
proteasome
A
large, 
protein-complex 
protease
found inside cells that degrades other proteins that
have been tagged for elimination by a smaller protein,
ubiquitin, in a process called ubiquitination. Ubiquitin
covalently attaches to lysines of the other proteins, tag-
ging them for proteolysis (cleavage of proteins by pro-
teases) within the proteasome.
protein
A
molecule composed of many amino 
acids and with a complex structure. For example,
immunoglobulin, casein.
See also AMINO ACID.
protein kinase
A kinase is an enzyme that transfers
a phosphate group from ATP to some molecule. A pro-
Breaking down unneeded proteins is accomplished by the 
orderly action of several multiprotein complexes. At the heart 
of this process is a multiprotein complex called the proteasome.
These machines of destruction consist of a tunnellike core with
a cap at either or both ends. The core is formed by four stacked
rings surrounding a central channel that acts as a degradation
chamber. The caps recognize and bind to proteins targeted by 
the cell for destruction, then use chemical energy to unfold the
proteins and inject them into the central core, where they are
broken into pieces. This is a fundamental kind of machine that
has been highly conserved during evolution. Some form of it 
is found in organisms ranging from simple bacteria to humans.

protein machines
Genomes are “brought to life” by
being read out or “expressed” according to a complex
set of directions embedded in the DNA sequence. The
products of expression are proteins that do essentially
all the work of the cell: they build cellular structures,
digest nutrients, execute other metabolic functions, and
mediate much of the information flow within a cell and
among cellular communities. To accomplish these
tasks, proteins typically work together with other pro-
teins or nucleic acids as multicomponent “molecular
machines,” structures that fit together and function in
highly specific, lock-and-key ways.
protein phosphatase (phosphoprotein phosphatase)
An enzyme that removes a phosphate group from a
protein by the use of hydrolysis; opposite effect of a
PROTEIN KINASE.

bohydrate content; component in the extracellular
matrix of animal cells. Composed of one or more gly-
cosaminoglycans, long polysaccharide chains covalent-
ly linked to protein cores.

sues differentiated from the apical meristem; the outer-
most tissue. The protoderm differentiates into the
plant’s epidermis of the roots and shoots.
proton
An atomic particle found in the nuclei of
atoms along with a neutron, but the proton has a posi-
tive electric charge.
protonephridium
An example of primitive kidneys for
osmoregulation and excretion among platyhelminthes.
Protonephridium consists of a network of two or more
closed longitudinal branched tubules running the length
of the body. The tubular system drains into excretory
ducts that empty into the environment through nephrid-
iopores, small external openings.
proton motive force
Energy or force created by the
transfer of protons (hydrogen ions) on one side only of a
cell membrane and across the membrane during chemios-
mosis; an electrochemical gradient that has potential
energy. This force can be channeled to operate rotating
flagella, generate ATP, and other needed activities.
proton pump
Proton pumps are a type of active
transport that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to force
the transport of protons out of the cell, thus creating a
membrane potential.
proto-oncogene
A normal gene that can become an
active oncogene, one that is capable of causing cells to
change into cancer cells, by mutation or insertion of
viral DNA.
protoplasm
The living material within cells.

or membrane has been removed, leaving only the cell
contents.
protoporphyrin IX
The PORPHYRIN LIGAND of HEME
b. Heme b is a Fe(II) porphyrin complex readily isolated
from the hemoglobin of beef blood, but it is also found
in other proteins, including other HEMOGLOBINs, MYO-
GLOBINs, CYTOCHROME P-450, CATALASEs, PEROXIDAS-
Es, as well as b type CYTOCHROMEs. Protoporphyrin IX
contains four methyl groups in positions 2, 7, 12, and
18, two vinyl groups in positions 3 and 8, and two pro-
pionic acid groups in positions 13 and 17.
protostome

blastopore becomes a mouth and who have spiral and
determinate cleavage.
protozoan
The simplest forms of animal life, con-
sisting of aquatic single cells or colonies of single cells,
such as amoeba and paramecium. The “protists”
ingest food and live in both fresh and marine waters as
well as inside animals, and most are motile. Estimates
of the number of species of protozoa are between
12,000 to 19,000 species. Many protozoans are
known to cause human disease, such as Giardia lam-
blia, a flagellated organism that can infect via water or
be contracted via contaminated foods. It causes giar-
diasis, the most frequent cause of nonbacterial diar-
rhea in North America. Cryptosporidium parvum has
a strong association between cases of cryptosporidiosis
and immunodeficient individuals (such as those with
AIDS). Cyclospora cayetanensis infection results in a
disease with nonspecific symptoms: usually one day of
malaise, low fever, diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting, and
weight loss. Cryptosporidium parvum causes intesti-
nal, tracheal, or pulmonary cryptosporidiosis. Acan-
thamoeba spp., Naegleria fowleri, and other amoebae
are
responsible for primary amoebic meningoen-
cephalitis (PAM). Naegleria fowleri is associated with
granulomatious amoebic encephalitis (GAE), acan-
thamoebic keratitis, and acanthamoebic uveitis. Enta-
moeba histolytica causes amoebiasis (or amebiasis),
resulting in various gastrointestinal upsets, including
colitis and diarrhea. In more severe cases, the gastroin-
testinal tract hemorrhages, resulting in dysentery.
Other protozoans such as Naegleria fowleri cause
meningitis; Trypanosoma cruzi causes African sleeping
sickness and Chagas disease; and Plasmodium spp.
causes malaria.
provirus
Term given to a retrovirus DNA when it is
integrated into the infected host cell genome. It can
remain inactive for periods of time and can be passed
to each of the infected cell’s daughter cells.
proximate 
causation
Explains 
how 
organisms
respond to their immediate environment (through
behavior, physiology, and other methods) and the
mechanics of those responses.
pseudocoelomate
Any invertebrate whose body cav-
ity is not completely lined with mesoderm. The embry-
onic blastocoel persists as a body cavity and is not
lined with mesodermal peritoneum (the lining of the
coelom); therefore it is called a pseudocoel (“false cavi-
ty”). Examples include nematodes, rotifers, acantho-
cephalans, kinorhynchs, and nematomorphs.
pseudopodium

theory that states that evolution works by alternating
periods of spurts of rapid change followed by long
periods of stasis.

bolous insect, for example, the stage in a butterfly or
moth when it is encased in a chrysalis and undergoing
metamorphosis.

quadruped
An animal that moves using four-footed
locomotion; moves using all four limbs.
quantitative character (polygenic character; polygenic
inheritance)
An inherited character or feature in a
population whose phenotypes have continuous varia-
tion, such as height or weight, and whose distribution
follows small discreet steps and can be numerically
measured or evaluated; expressed often from one
extreme to another. The effects are due to both envi-
ronment and the additive effect of two or more genes.
quantum evolution
A rapid increase in the rate of
evolution over a short period of time.
quarantine
A way to control or prevent importing,
exporting, or transporting of plants, animals, agricul-
tural products, and other items that may be able to
spread disease or become a pest.
quasisocial
Refers to a situation where members of
the same generation share a nest and care for the
brood.
Quaternary period
The most recent geologic period
of the Cenozoic era. It began 2 million years ago with
the growth and movement of Northern Hemisphere
continental glaciers and the Ice Age.
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
quaternary structure
There are four levels of struc-
ture found in polypeptides and proteins. The first or
primary structure of a polypeptide or protein deter-
mines its secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures.
The primary structure is the amino acid sequence. This
is followed by the secondary structure, how the amino
acids adjacent to each other are organized in the struc-
ture. The tertiary or third structure is the folded three-
dimensional protein structure that allows it to perform
its role, and the fourth or quaternary structure is the
total protein structure that is made when all the sub-
units are in place. Quaternary structure is used to
describe proteins composed of multiple subunits or mul-
tiple polypeptide molecules, each called a monomer. The
arrangement of the monomers in the three-dimensional
protein is the quaternary structure. A considerable
range of quaternary structure is found in proteins.
queen
A member of the reproductive caste in semiso-
cial or eusocial insect species.
queenright
A
colony that contains a functional
queen. A monogynous colony in which one morpho-
logically different female ant is the only reproducer.
281
Q

queen substance
A pheromone secreted by queen
bees and given to worker bees that controls them from
producing more queens.
quiescent center
A region of cells behind the root cap
that contains a population of mitotically inactive cells;
precedes the organization of a root meristem and con-
tains high levels of the enzyme ascorbic acid oxidase,
which may suggest a mechanism that links gene expres-
sion with patterning. It is the region in the apical meris-
tem that has little activity, and cells rarely divide or do so
very slowly. However, cells can be encouraged to divide
by wounding of the root. The quiescent center (QC) con-
sists of a small group of cells at the tip called the initials.
It is the initials that divide very slowly and create the qui-
escent center. Cells around the QC divide rapidly and
form the majority of the cells of the root body.
282
queen substance

raceme
An inflorescence, a flower structure, in
which stalked flowers are borne in succession along an
elongate axis, with the youngest at the top and oldest
at the base.
racemic
Pertaining to a racemate, an equimolar mix-
ture of a pair of ENANTIOMERs. It does not exhibit opti-
cal activity.
radial cleavage
A form of embryonic development
where cleavage planes are either parallel or perpendicu-
lar to the vertical axis of the embryo. Found in
deuterostomes, which include echinoderms and chor-
dates.
radial symmetry
A body shape characterized by
equal parts that radiate outward from the center like a
pie. Found in cnidarians and echinoderms.
Radiata
The animal phylum that includes cnidarians
and ctenophores; radially symmetric.
radiation
Released energy that travels through
space or substances as particles or electromagnetic
waves and includes visible and ultraviolet light, heat,
X rays, and cosmic rays. Radiation can be nonionizing
(infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, electromagnetic) or
ionizing (alpha, beta, gamma, and X rays). Ionizing
radiation can have severe effects on human health, but
it is also used in medical diagnostic equipment and
can be used to provide a host of other economic 
benefits from electrical power generation to smoke
detectors.
radical
A molecular entity possessing one or more
unpaired electrons, formerly often called “free radical.”
A radical can be charged positively (radical cation) or
negatively (radical anion). Paramagnetic metal ions are
not normally regarded as radicals.
radicle
An embryonic plant root.
radioactive isotope
An isotope is an element with a
different amount of neutrons than protons. Isotopes
are unstable and spin off energy and particles. There
are radioactive and nonradioactive isotopes, and some
elements have both, such as carbon. Each radioactive
isotope has its own unique half-life, which is the time it
takes for half of the parent radioactive element to
decay to a daughter product. Some examples of
radioactive elements, their stable daughters, and half-
lives are: potassium 40–argon 40 (1.25 billion years);
rubidium 87–strontium 87 (48.8 billion years); thorium
232–lead 208 (14 billion years); uranium 235–lead 207
283
R

(704 million years); uranium 238–lead 206 (4.47 bil-
lion years); carbon 14-nitrogen 14 (5,730 years).
See also ELEMENT.
radiocarbon dating
By using radioactive isotopes,
it is possible to qualitatively measure organic material
over a period of time. Radioactive decay transforms
an atom of the parent isotope to an atom of a differ-
ent element (the daughter isotope) and ultimately
leads to the formation of stable nuclei from the unsta-
ble nuclei. Archeologists and other scientists use
radioactive carbon to date organic remains. The
radioactive isotope of carbon, known as carbon-14, is
produced in the upper atmosphere and absorbed in a
known proportion by all plants and animals. Once the
organism dies, the carbon-14 in it begins to decay at a
steady, known rate. Measuring the amount of radio-
carbon remaining in an organic sample provides an
estimate of its age. The approximate half-life of car-
bon 14 is 5,730 plus or minus 30 years and is good
for dating up to about 23,000 years. The carbon-14
method was developed by the American physicist
Willard F. Libby in 1947.
radiometric dating
The use of radioactive isotopes
and their half-lives to give absolute dates to rock for-
mations, artifacts, and fossils. Radioactive elements
tend to concentrate in human-made artifacts, igneous
rocks, the continental crust, and so the technique is not
very useful for sedimentary rocks, although in some
cases, when certain elements are found, it is possible to
date them using this technique. Other radiometric dat-
ing techniques used are:
Electron Dating Spin Resonance
Electrons become trapped in the crystal lattice of min-
erals from adjacent radioactive material and alter the
magnetic field of the mineral at a known rate. This
nondestructive technique is used for dating bone and
shell, since exposure to magnetic fields does not
destroy the material (e.g., carbonates [calcium] in lime-
stone, coral, egg shells, and teeth).
Fission Track Dating
This technique is used for dating glassy material like
obsidian or any artifacts that contain uranium-bear-
ing material, such as natural or human-made glass,
ceramics, or stones that were used in hearths for food
preparation. Narrow fission tracks from the release
of high-energy charged alpha particles burn into the
material as a result of the decay of uranium 238 to
lead 206 (half-life of 4.47 billion years) or induced by
the irradiation of uranium 235 to lead 207 (half-life
of 704 million years). The number of tracks is pro-
portional to the time since the material cooled from
its original molten condition, i.e., fission tracks are
created at a constant rate throughout time, so it is
possible to determine the amount of time that has
passed since the track accumulation began from the
number of tracks present. This technique is good for
dates from 20 million to 1 billion years ago. U-238
fission track techniques are from spontaneous fission,
and induced-fission tracking from U-235 is a tech-
nique involving controlled irradiation of the artifact
with thermal neutrons of U-235. Both techniques give
a thermal age for the material in question. The spon-
taneous fission of uranium-238 was first discovered
by the Russian scientists K. A. Petrzhak and G. N.
Flerov in 1940.
Potassium-Argon Dating
This method has been used to date rocks as old as 
4 billion years and is a popular dating technique for
archeological material. Potassium-40, with a half-life
of 1.3 billion years in volcanic rock, decays into
argon-40 and calcium-40 at a known rate. Dates are
determined by measuring the amount of argon-40 
in a sample. Argon-40 and argon-39 ratios can 
also be used for dating in the same way. Potassium-
argon dating is accurate from 4.3 billion years (the
age of the Earth) to about 100,000 years before the
present.
Radiocarbon Dating
See RADIOCARBON DATING.
Thermoluminescence Dating
A technique used for dating ceramics, bricks, sediment
layers, burnt flint, lava, and even cave structures like
stalactites and stalagmites. It is based on the fact that
some materials, when heated, give off a flash of light.
The intensity of the light is used to date the specimen
and is proportional to the quantity of radiation it has
been exposed to and the time span since it was 
heated. Similar to the electron spin resonance (ESR)
284
radiocarbon dating

technique. Good for dates between 10,000 and
230,000 years.
radionuclide
A
radioactive 
nuclide. 
The 
term
nuclide implies an atom of specified atomic number
and mass number. In the study of biochemical process-
es, radioactive isotopes are used for labeling com-
pounds that subsequently are used to investigate
various aspects of the reactivity or METABOLISM of pro-
teins, carbohydrates, and lipids or as sources of radia-
tion in IMAGING. The fate of the radionuclide in
reactive products or metabolites is determined by fol-
lowing (counting) the emitted radiation. Prominent
among the radionuclides used in biochemical research
are : 3H, 14C, 32P, 35Ca, 99mTc, 125I, and 131I.
ragweed (Ambrosia)
Ragweed refers to the group of
approximately 15 species of weed plants, belonging to
the Compositae family. Most ragweed species are
native to North America, although they are also found
in eastern Europe and the French Rhône valley. The
ragweeds are annuals characterized by their rough,
hairy stems and mostly lobed or divided leaves. The
ragweed flowers are greenish and inconspicuously con-
cealed in small heads on the leaves.
The ragweed species, whose copious pollen is the
main cause of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hayfever) in
eastern and middle North America, are the common
ragweed (A. artemisiifolia) and the great, or giant, rag-
weed (A. trifida). The common ragweed grows to
about 1 meter (3.5 feet), is common all across North
America, and is also commonly referred to as Roman
wormwood, hogweed, hogbrake, or bitterweed. The
giant ragweed, meanwhile, can reach anywhere up to 5
meters (17 feet) in height and is native from Quebec to
British Columbia in Canada and southward to Florida,
Arkansas, and California in the United States. Due to
the fact that ragweeds are annuals, they can be eradi-
cated simply by being mowed before they release their
pollen in late summer.
rain forest
An evergreen forest of the tropics distin-
guished by a continuous, closed canopy of leafy trees of
variable height and diverse flora and fauna, with an
average rainfall of about 100 inches per year. Rain
forests play an important role in the global environ-
ment, and destruction of tropical rain forests reduces
the amount of carbon dioxide absorbed, causing
increases in levels of carbon dioxide and other atmo-
spheric gases. Cutting and burning of tropical forests
contributes about 20 percent of the carbon dioxide
added to the atmosphere each year. Rain forest destruc-
tion also means the loss of a wide spectrum of flora
and fauna.
rash (dermatitis)
An inflammation of the upper lay-
ers of the skin, causing rash, blisters, scabbing, redness,
and swelling. There are many different types of der-
matitis, including: acrodermatitis, allergic contact der-
matitis, atopic dermatitis, contact dermatitis, diaper
rash (diaper dermatitis), exfoliative dermatitis, herpeti-
formis dermatitis, irritant dermatitis, occupational der-
matitis, perioral dermatitis, photoallergic dermatitis,
phototoxic dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, and toxi-
codendron dermatitis.
Contact Dermatitis (allergic contact dermatitis, con-
tact eczema, irritant contact dermatitis)
Contact dermatitis is a reaction that occurs when skin
comes in contact with certain substances. There are
two mechanisms by which substances can cause skin
inflammation: irritation (irritant contact dermatitis) or
allergic reaction (allergic contact dermatitis). Common
irritants include soap, detergents, acids, alkalis, and
organic solvents (as are present in nail polish remover).
Contact dermatitis is most often seen around the hands
or areas that touched or were exposed to the
irritant/allergen. Contact dermatitis of the feet also
exists, but it differs in that it is due to the warm, moist
conditions in the shoes and socks.
An allergic reaction does not generally occur the
first time one is exposed to a particular substance, but
it can on subsequent exposures, which can cause der-
matitis in 4 to 24 hours.
Treatment includes removal or avoidance of the
substance causing the irritation, and cleansing the
area with water and mild soap (to avoid infection). A
recent recommendation for mild cases is to use a man-
ganese sulfate solution to reduce the itching. Antihis-
tamines are generally not very helpful. The most
common treatment for severe contact dermatitis is
with corticosteroid tablets, ointments, or creams,
rash
285

which diminish the immune attack and the resulting
inflammation.
Toxicodendron Dermatitis
When people get urushiol—the oil present in poison
ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac—on their skin, it
causes another form of allergic contact dermatitis (see
above). This is a T-cell-mediated immune response, also
called delayed hypersensitivity, in which the body’s
immune system recognizes as foreign and attacks the
complex of urushiol derivatives with skin proteins. The
irony is that urushiol, in the absence of the immune
attack, would be harmless.
Atopic Dermatitis
Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, itchy inflammation of
the upper layers of the skin. Often develops in people
who have hay fever or asthma or who have family
members with these conditions. Most commonly dis-
played during infanthood, usually disappearing by the
age of three or four. Recent medical studies suggest that
Staphylococcus aureus (a bacteria) contributes to exac-
erbation of atopic dermatitis.
Treatment is similar to that of contact dermatitis.
Seborrheic Dermatitis
An inflammation of the upper layers of the skin where
scales appear on the scalp, face, and sometimes in other
areas. Usually more common in cold weather and often
runs in families.
Stasis Dermatitis
A chronic redness, scaling, warmth, and swelling on
the lower legs. Often results in dark brown skin due to
a pooling of blood and fluid under the skin, thus usual-
ly displayed by those with varicose veins and edema.
rate-controlling step (rate-determining step; rate-
limiting step)
A rate-controlling step in a reaction
occurring by a composite mechanism is an elementary
reaction, the rate constant for which exerts a dominant
effect—stronger than that of any other rate constant—
on the overall rate.
Réaumur, René-Antoine Ferchault de (1683–1757)
French Philosopher, Naturalist
René Réaumur was
born in La Rochelle, France, in 1683. After studying
mathematics in Bourges he moved to Paris in 1703 at
age 20 and under the eye of a relative. Like most scien-
tists of the time, he made contributions in a number of
areas, including meteorology. His work in mathematics
allowed him entrance to the Academy of Sciences in
1708. Two years later, he was put in charge of compil-
ing a description of the industrial and natural resources
in France, and as a result he developed a broad-based
view of the sciences. It also inspired him to invention,
which led him into the annals of weather and climate
and, ultimately, the invention of a thermometer and
temperature scale.
In 1713 Réaumur made spun-glass fibers that were
made of the same material as today’s building blocks of
Ethernet networking and fiber-optic cable. A few years
later, in 1719, after observing wasps building nests, he
suggested that paper could be made from wood in
response to a critical shortage of papermaking materials
(rags) at the time. He also was impressed by the geomet-
rical perfection of the beehive’s hexagonal cells and pro-
posed that they be used as a unit of measurement.
He turned his interests from industrial resources
such as steel to temperature, and in 1730 he presented to
the Paris Academy his study “A Guide for the Produc-
tion of Thermometers with Comparable Scales.” He
wanted to improve the reliability of thermometers based
on the work of Guillaume Amontons, though he appears
not to be familiar with Fahrenheit’s earlier work.
His thermometer of 1731 used a mixture of alco-
hol (wine) and water instead of mercury, perhaps creat-
ing the first alcohol thermometer, and it was calibrated
with a scale he created called the Réaumur scale. This
scale had 0° for freezing and 80° for boiling points of
water. The scale is no longer used today. However,
most of Europe, with the exception of the British Isles
and Scandinavia, adopted his thermometer and scale.
Unfortunately, his errors in the way he fixed his
points were criticized by many in the scientific communi-
ty at the time, and even with modifications in the scale,
instrument makers favored making mercury-based ther-
mometers. Réaumur’s scale, however, lasted over a cen-
tury, and in some places well into the late 20th century.
Between 1734 and 1742, Réaumur wrote six vol-
umes of Mémoires pour servir à l’histoire des insectes
(Memoirs serving as a natural history of insects).
Although unfinished, this work was an important con-
tribution to entomology. He also noticed that crayfish
286
rate-controlling step

have the ability to regenerate lost limbs and demon-
strated that corals were animals, not plants. In 1735 he
introduced the concept of growing degree-days, later
known as Réaumur’s thermal constant of phenology.
This idea led to the heat-unit system used today to
study plant-temperature relationships.
In 1737 Réaumur became an honorary member of
the Russian Academy of Sciences, and the following
year he became a fellow of the Royal Society.
After studying the chemical composition of Chi-
nese porcelain, in 1740 he formulated his own Réau-
mur porcelain. In 1750 while investigating the animal
world, he designed an egg incubator. Two years later, in
1752, he discovered that digestion is a chemical process
by isolating gastric juice and studied its role in food
digestion by studying hawks and dogs.
Réaumur died in La Bermondière on October 18,
1757, and bequeathed to the Academy of Science his
cabinet of natural history with his collections of miner-
als and plants.
recapitulation
The repetition of stages of evolution
in the stages of development in the individual organism
(ONTOGENY). The history of the individual develop-
ment of an organism.
receptor
A molecule or a polymeric structure in or
on a cell that specifically recognizes and binds a com-
pound acting as a molecular messenger (neurotransmit-
ter, HORMONE, lymphokine, lectin, DRUG, etc.).
receptor mapping
The technique used to describe
the geometric and/or electronic features of a binding
site when insufficient structural data for this RECEPTOR
or ENZYME are available. Generally the active-site cavi-
ty is defined by comparing the superposition of active
molecules with that of inactive molecules.
receptor-mediated endocytosis  Cells use RECEPTOR-
mediated 
endocytosis—a 
method 
where
specific
molecules are ingested into the cell—for ingestion of
nutrients, hormones, and growth factors. The specifici-
ty results from a receptor-LIGAND (a molecule or ion
that can bind another molecule) interaction. Other lig-
ands that can be ingested include toxins and lectins,
viruses, and serum transport proteins and antibodies. A
receptor, a specific binding protein such as clathrin, on
the plasma membrane of the target tissue will specifi-
cally bind to ligands on the outside of the cell. An
endocytotic process results, i.e., the cell folds inward
with a portion of the plasma membrane, and the result-
ing clathrin-coated pit is pinched off to form a mem-
brane-enclosed bubble or vesicle, called an endosome.
After entering the cytoplasm, the endocytotic vesicle
loses its clathrin coat, and the ligand (multiple ligands
can enter the cell in the same coated pit) is ingested.
The receptor can be recycled to the surface by vesicles
that bud from the endosome targeting the plasma mem-
brane. After these recycling vesicles fuse with the plas-
ma membrane, the receptor is returned to the cell
surface for binding and activity once more.
receptor potential (end-plate potential)
A change in
a neuron’s membrane potential (a change in voltage
across the receptor membrane) caused by redistribution
of ions responding to the strength of the stimulus. If
the potential is high enough, an action potential will be
fired in an afferent neuron. The more action potentials
fired, the more neurotransmitters released, and stronger
the signals reaching the brain.
recessive allele
An allele that is not expressed 
phenotypically in a heterozygote due to the presence
of a dominant or masking allele. However, it will be
expressed in a specific phenotype when a counterpart
recessive gene is present. However, often when indi-
viduals inherit two mutant copies of a gene on one of
the autosomes, they suffer from autosomal recessive
disorders. Examples like hemophilia occur where
the recessive gene associated with it lies on part of the
X chromosome (X-linked recessive disorder). Most
genetic mutations produce recessive alleles.
recessive disorder
A disorder associated with a
recessive allele.
reciprocal altruism
The belief that if one acts
kindly toward another unrelated individual, that 
reciprocal altruism
287

individual will be inclined to perform the same act
back or to another individual. The individual giving
does not necessarily expect anything back, only that
the kindly act will be repeated and benefit society as a
whole.
recognition species concept
A concept of species as
a set of individuals that recognize each other as poten-
tial mates; having a common or shared system of mate
recognition, i.e., courtship displays, that ensures mat-
ing with members of the same population.
recombinant
An individual where the genotype is
produced by the nonparental arrangement of alleles
that results from independent assortment or crossing
over (recombination); the phenotype individual is dif-
ferent from the parents; also, a term describing a new
combination of genes that form DNA.
recombinant DNA
Altered DNA that has been
joined, mostly by in vitro means, by genetic material
from two different sources.
recombinant DNA technology
Refers to the mod-
ern techniques of gene cloning.
redox potential
Any oxidation–reduction (redox)
reaction can be divided into two half reactions: one in
which a chemical species undergoes oxidation, and
one in which another chemical species undergoes
reduction. If a half-reaction is written as a reduction,
the driving force is the reduction potential. If the half-
reaction is written as oxidation, the driving force is
the oxidation potential related to the reduction poten-
tial by a sign change. So the redox potential is the
reduction/oxidation potential of a compound mea-
sured under standard conditions against a standard
reference half-cell. In biological systems, the standard
redox potential is defined at pH = 7.0 versus the
hydrogen electrode and partial pressure of hydrogen =
1 bar.
See also ELECTRODE POTENTIAL.
redox reaction
An abbreviated term for an oxidation-
reduction reaction; a reaction that has both reduction
(electrons are gained) and oxidation (electrons are lost)
occurring; one does not occur without the other.
reducing agent
The reactant that donates its elec-
trons and in turn becomes oxidized when another 
substance is reduced.
See also OXIDATION; REDOX REACTION; REDUCTION.
reductase
See OXIDOREDUCTASE.
288
recognition species concept

reduction
The part of a redox reaction where the
reactant has a net gain of electrons and in which a dif-
ferent reactant must oxidize (lose electrons).
See also OXIDATION.
reductive elimination
The reverse of OXIDATIVE
ADDITION.
reductive speciation
Complete fusion of two previ-
ously independent evolutionary species—a hybridiza-
tion/intergradation phenomenon.
reflex
An active response to a stimulus that is usu-
ally involuntary and reproducible; many types exist
from simple to complex. A common example is the
kick response when a doctor hits a knee with a small
hammer.
refractory period
At the end of the action potential,
the absolute refractory period (ARP) is the interval
immediately following the discharge of a nerve impulse
(action potential) during which the cell cannot be
induced to fire again. A relative refractory period is the
time following the ARP where a neuron can be induced
to discharge again but only if there is a more intense
stimulus than normal.
regulation
Refers to control of activity of an
ENZYME (system) or GENE EXPRESSION.
regulative development (indeterminate development)
A development pattern in which cell fates are not deter-
mined until late in development; depends on interac-
tions with neighboring cells. For example, in mice
gastrulation, if the majority of embryonic cells are
destroyed, a normal mouse can still develop from the
remainder.
Reichstein, 
Tadeus 
(1897–1996) 
Swiss Chemist
Tadeus Reichstein was born on July 20, 1897, at Wlo-
clawek, Poland, to Isidor Reichstein and Gastava
Brockmann. He was educated at a boarding school at
Jena after his family moved to Zurich in 1906 (where
he was naturalized). He had a private tutor and then
attended the Oberrealschule (technical school of junior
college grade) and the Eidgenössische Technische
Hochschule (E.T.H.) (state technical college).
In 1916 he began to study chemistry at the E.T.H.
at Zurich and graduated in 1920. In 1922 he began
research on the composition of the flavoring substances
in roasted coffee, a project that lasted for nine years.
In 1931 he turned to other scientific research, and
by 1938 he was professor in pharmaceutical chemistry
and director of the pharmaceutical institute in the Uni-
versity of Basel. From 1946 to 1967 he was professor
of organic chemistry at the University of Basel.
In 1933 he synthesized vitamin C (ascorbic acid)
and worked on plant glycosides. From 1953 to 1954
he worked with several other scientists and was the
first to isolate and explain the constitution of aldo-
sterone, a hormone of the adrenal cortex. He also col-
laborated with E. C. KENDALL and P. S. HENCH in
their work on the hormones of the adrenal cortex. For
this work, Reichstein, Kendall, and Hench were joint-
ly awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine
in 1950.
After 1967 he worked on the study of ferns and
published many papers on the subject. He died on
August 1, 1996, in Basel.
relapsing fever
A tropical disease associated with
some 20 species of the bacteria genus Borrelia that is
transmitted to humans by two vectors, soft ticks
(Ornithodoros or Argas) or, in the case of Borrelia
recurrentis, by lice. Louse-borne relapsing fever is more
severe than the tick-borne variety.
relative configuration
The CONFIGURATION of any
stereogenic (asymmetric) center with respect to any
other stereogenic center contained within the same
molecular entity. A stereogenic unit is a grouping with-
in a molecular entity that can be considered a focus of
STEREOISOMERism.
relative fitness
One genotype contributes to the next
generation. If the population is stable, i.e., neither
relative fitness
289

increasing nor decreasing, then the genotype with a rel-
ative fitness of more than one will increase in frequen-
cy, whereas if the genotype has a relative fitness of less
than one, it will decrease.
relaxation
If a system is disturbed from its state of
equilibrium, it returns to that state, and the process is
referred to as relaxation.
releaser
A signal stimulus that functions as a com-
munication signal between individuals of the same
species and initiates a fixed action pattern (FAP), a
stereotyped species-to-species behavior.
reniform
Kidney shaped, such as a kidney bean.
repetitive DNA
Repeated DNA sequences that may
occur in the thousands of copies in the chromosomes of
eukaryotes; represents much of the human genome.
These sequences of variable length can be repeated up
to 100,000 (middle repetitive) or over 100,000 (highly
repetitive) copies per genome. Much of the DNA in
eukaryotes is repetitive.
replication fork

prevents RNA polymerase from commencing mRNA
synthesis.
Reptilia
The class of vertebrate animals that includes
snakes, turtles, lizards, tuatara, crocodilians, and
extinct fossil species. Reptiles have scales or modified
scales, breathe air, are cold blooded, and usually lay
eggs. The reptiles evolved from amphibians during the
late Carboniferous or early Permian periods. Today
there are about 2,500 species of snakes, 3,000 of
lizards, 250 of turtles and tortoises, and 21 species of
crocodilians and distributed worldwide throughout
temperate and tropical regions.
reservoir host
The host, a vertebrate, that harbors a
particular parasite and acts as a long-term source of
infection of other vertebrates or vectors.
resistance
The ability of an organism to resist
microorganisms or toxins produced in disease.
resolving power
A property of instruments, like
microscopes and telescopes, that distinguish objects
that are close to each other; the smaller the minimum
distance at which two objects can be distinguished, the
greater the resolving power.

resonance Raman spectroscopy
A
spectroscopic
technique increasingly used in bioinorganic chemistry for
characterization and assignment of vibrations directly
connected with a CHROMOPHORE, as well for the assign-
ment of the chromophore. The excitation frequency is
applied close to the absorption maximum of the chro-
mophore. Particularly useful for deeply colored species.
resource partitioning
The process whereby coexist-
ing species living in the same ecosystem each find a sep-
arate niche so that resources can be divided up and
used without having to compete. Often a few dominant
species are able to exploit most of the resources, and
the rest divide up the remainder.
respiration
The process where mitochondria in the
cells of plants and animals release chemical energy
from sugar and other organic molecules through chem-
ical oxidation.
See also KREBS CYCLE.
respiratory system
The respiratory system is the
system by which oxygen, essential for life, is taken
into the body and the waste product, carbon dioxide,
is expelled from the body. The respiratory system
consists of the mouth and nose, airways, and lungs.
Air enters through the mouth and nose and passes
down the pharynx (throat) and through the larynx
(voice box). Air then continues down through the tra-
chea (windpipe), which branches into two bronchi
(singular: bronchus) to each of the two lungs. The
inflammation of the bronchus is called bronchitis.
The bronchi branch many times until becoming much
smaller airways called “bronchioles.” At the end of
each bronchiole are tiny air-filled cavities called alve-
oli. Each alveolus is surrounded by many blood capil-
laries, which allow oxygen to move into the
bloodstream and carbon dioxide out. This exchange
of substances is the primary function of the respirato-
ry system.
resting potential
The state of a neuron’s charge, the
gradient of electric potential across the membrane,
when it is in a resting state and ready to receive a nerve
impulse (the ACTION POTENTIAL); usually consists of a
negative charge on the inside of the cell relative to the
outside. At rest, the cell membrane electrical gradient
maintains a negative interior charge of –70 mv.
restriction enzyme (restriction endonuclease)
A DNA
cutting protein that recognizes a specific nucleotide
sequence in a DNA molecule and excises the DNA;
found in bacteria. Some sites are common and occur
every several hundred base pairs, while others are less
common. Bacteria possess several hundred restriction
enzymes that cut more than 100 different DNA
sequences. Each restriction enzyme has a single, specific
recognition sequence and cuts the DNA molecule at a
specific site. Some restriction enzymes have been used
in RECOMBINANT DNA TECHNOLOGY.
restriction fragment-length polymorphisms (RFLPs)
A polymorphism is a genetic variant that appears in
about 1 percent of the population, e.g., the human Rh
factor. An RFLP is a variation between individuals in
DNA fragment sizes cut by specific restriction
enzymes. RFLPs usually are caused by mutation at a
cutting site. The resulting polymorphic sequences in
RFLPs are used as markers on both physical and
genetic linkage maps. RFLPs are useful in screening
human DNA for the presence of potentially deleterious
genes, e.g., sickle cell anemia, and for DNA finger-
printing in forensic science.
restriction site
The specific site on a DNA strand
where a restriction enzyme cuts DNA.
reticulate
Lacelike or netlike in texture, repeating
intercrossing between lines; divided or marked to form
a network. In evolution, the lateral transfer, back and
forth, of genetic information; the complex pattern of
species origin by hybridization.
retina
The inner back surface, the posterior por-
tion, of the eye; composed of neural tissue and pho-
toreceptive cells that line the inner eye. The retina
converts light energy into nerve impulses and sends
292
resonance Raman spectroscopy

them to the optic nerve by using a set of nerve cells—
horizontal, bipolar, amacine, and retinal ganglion
cells—finally leading to the brain for interpretation.
Two types of sensory cells, called photoreceptors,
allow the visualization of color, contrast (sharp cen-
tral vision), and night vision. Cone cells, which are
more dense in the center of the retina, are responsible
for seeing color and contrast during daylight, while
the rods, which are more numerous around the
peripheral areas of the retina, are thousands of times
more sensitive than cones and allow vision in the
dark and allow side or peripheral vision. The choroid
is a layer of the retina filled with blood vessels that
nourish it.
retinue
The group of workers that surrounds a
queen in insect societies; attendants or followers.
Queen bees release a pheromone, queen mandibular
pheromone (QMP), that is both a releaser and a
primer. As a releaser it attracts worker bees to their
queen, and as a primer it inhibits queen rearing and
suppresses the ontogeny of worker foraging by dimin-
ishing the release of juvenile hormone in worker bees.
QMP also stimulates the retinue response in honeybees
by way of licking and antennating behavior that signals
the presence of a dominant reproductive queen and
establishes and stabilizes the social structure of the bee
colony. QMP is spread throughout the colony by ret-
inue behavior. When worker bees turn toward the
queen and form a retinue around her, several bees con-
currently touch the queen (using their antennae,
forelegs, or mouthparts) and then proceed through the
hive passing on the pheromone.
retrovirus
An RNA virus that encodes an enzyme
called REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE to convert into DNA
when inserted into a host’s cell DNA, thereby repro-
ducing the virus. HIV viruses are retroviruses, and they
also are a class of cancer-causing viruses. Retro is short
for REverse TRanscriptase Onko.
reverse transcriptase
An enzyme that retroviruses
use to encode RNA to convert to DNA.
revision
In taxonomy, the reclassification of a group
of species as the result of additional study.
Rh blood types

virus that causes hemorrhagic fever. (Courtesy of Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention)
The retina converts light energy into nerve impulses and sends
them to the optic nerve by using a set of nerve cells.

controlled by two closely linked genes on chromosome
1. Can lead to serious medical complications between a
mother and her developing fetus if they have different
Rh blood types (+ or –). This can occur when the par-
ents have different Rh blood types, e.g., the mother is
Rh– and the father is Rh+.
See also BLOOD.
rhizome
A modified underground stem (has nodes
and scalelike leaves) that grows horizontal along or
below the ground and sends out roots and shoots.
rhodopsin
The red photosensitive pigment found in
the retina’s rod cells; contains the protein opsin linked
to retinene (or retinal), a light-absorbing chemical
derived from vitamin A and formed only in the dark.
Light striking the rhodopsin molecule forces it to
change shape and generate signals as the retinene splits
from the opsin, which is then reattached in the dark to
complete the visual cycle.
ribonucleic acid (RNA)
Linear polymer molecule
composed of a chain of ribose units linked between
positions 3 and 5 by phosphodiester groups. The bases
adenine or guanine (via atom N-9) or uracil or cyto-
sine (via atom N-1) are attached to ribose at its atom
C-1 by ß-N-glycosidic bonds. The three most impor-
tant types of RNAs in the cell are messenger RNA
(mRNA), transfer RNA (tRNA), and ribosomal RNA
(rRNA).
See also NUCLEOTIDES.
ribonucleotide reductases
ENZYMEs that catalyze
the reduction of ribonucleotide diphosphates or
triphosphates to the corresponding deoxyribonu-
cleotides by a 
RADICAL-dependent reaction. The
enzyme of animal, yeast, and AEROBIC ESCHERICHIA
COLI cells contains an oxo-bridged DINUCLEAR iron
center and a tyrosyl radical cation, and uses thioredox-
in, a thiol-containing protein, as reductant. At least
three other ribonucleotide reductases are known from
bacteria, containing an IRON–SULFUR CLUSTER with a
glycyl radical, adenosyl COBALAMIN, and a dinuclear
manganese CLUSTER.
ribose
The sugar component of RNA; a five-carbon
(pentose) aldose.
ribosomal RNA (rRNA)

adenine. (Courtesy of Darryl Leja, NHGRI, National Institutes of
Health)

AUTOTROPHIC bacteria. It catalyzes the synthesis of 3-
phospho-D-glycerate from ribulose bisphosphate and
also the oxidation of ribulose bisphosphate by O2 to 3-
phospho-D-glycerate and 2-phosphoglycolate.
Richards, Dickinson Woodruff, Jr. (1895–1973)
American Physiologist
Dickinson Woodruff Richards
Jr. was born on October 30, 1895, in Orange, New 
Jersey, to Dickinson W. Richards, a New York lawyer,
and Sally Lambert. He was educated at the Hotchkiss
School in Connecticut, and in 1913 he went to Yale
University to study English and Greek. In June 1917 he
was awarded a B.A. After a period as instructor in
artillery during 1917–18, he served as an artillery offi-
cer in France.
After the war, he attended Columbia University
College of Physicians and Surgeons, receiving an M.A.
in physiology in 1922 and an M.D. in 1923. From
1923 to 1927 he was on the staff of the Presbyterian
Hospital, New York, followed by a year at the Nation-
al Institute for Medical Research, London, under Sir
Henry DALE, working on the control of the circulation
in the liver.
In 1931 Richards collaborated with André COUR-
NAND at Bellevue Hospital, New York, and in 1940
he developed a technique for catheterization of the
heart, along with later studies of traumatic shock, the
diagnosis of congenital heart diseases, the physiology
of heart failure, measurement of the actions of car-
diac drugs, and various forms of dysfunction in
chronic cardiac and pulmonary diseases and their
treatment. He was awarded, together with André
Cournand and Werner FORSSMANN, the 1956 Nobel
Prize in physiology or medicine for his work on
catheterization.

In 1945 Richards was appointed professor of
medicine at Columbia University and visiting physician
and director of the First (Columbia) Division of the
Bellevue Hospital, New York. In 1947 he became Lam-
bert professor of medicine, and he retired in 1961. He
served as editor of The American Review of Tuberculo-

Medicine and of Circulation. He died on February 23,
1973, in Lakeville, Connecticut.
Richet, Charles-Robert (1850–1935) French Physi-
ologist
Charles Richet was born on August 25, 1850,
in Paris to Alfred Richet, a professor of clinical surgery
in the Faculty of Medicine, Paris, and his wife Eugénie
Renouard. He studied in Paris at the Faculty of
Medicine, receiving degrees of doctor of medicine
(M.D.) in 1869 and doctor of sciences in physiology in
1878, but he also wrote poetry and drama while in
school to cope with the boredom. He became a profes-
sor of physiology in 1887 at the University of Paris, in
the Sorbonne, where he stayed until 1927. In 1888 he
showed that the blood of animals vaccinated against an
infection protected the animals against this infection,
and two years later he gave the first serotherapeutic
injection in humans.
In 1902 Richet made contributions in the study of
anaphylaxis, a term he used to describe a hypersensi-
tive reaction (e.g., allergy) to injections of foreign pro-
teins, e.g., serums, a phenomenon noted earlier by
Theobald Smith. Anaphylaxis is a deadly reaction in a
sensitized individual following a second injection of an
antigen. It is called Richet’s phenomenon in his honor.
For his work on anaphylaxis he received the 1913
Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine.
He also worked on serum therapy, the nervous sys-
tem, and role of animal heat in homeothermic animals,
and he was interested in psychological research, work-
ing in hypnosis and coining the word metaphysique for
research in the field of parapsychology.
From 1878 to 1902 he was editor of the Revue Sci-
entifique, and beginning in 1917 he served as the coedi-
tor of the Journal de Physiologie et de Pathologie
Générale. He published numerous papers on physiolo-
gy, physiological chemistry, experimental pathology,
and normal and pathological psychology. Several of his
important books were: Suc Gastrique chez l’Homme et
chez les Animaux (Gastric juice in man and in animals),
1878; Leçons sur les Muscles et les Nerfs (Lectures on
the muscles and nerves), 1881; Leçons sur la Chaleur
Animale (Lectures on animal heat), 1884; Essai de Psy-
chologie Générale (Essay on general psychology), 1884;
Souvenirs d’un Physiologiste (Memoirs of a physiolo-
gist), 1933. He was also the editor of Dictionnaire de
Physiologie (Dictionary of physiology), 1895–1912.
Aside from his medical research, he wrote poems,
dramatic works, and even designed a self-powered air-
plane, one of the first. He died in Paris on December 4,
1935.
rickettsia

RNA processing
Synthesis of messenger RNA
(mRNA) in a eukaryotic cell involves numerous succes-
sive steps: transcription initiation and elongation; RNA
processing reactions, such as capping (modification of
the 5’-ends of eukaryotic mRNAs), splicing (removing
introns, “junk” DNA), and polyadenylation (modifica-
tion of the 3’-ends of eukaryotic mRNA); and finally
termination of transcription.

Robbins, a plant physiologist who became director of
the New York Botanical Gardens, and Christine (née
Chapman).
He received a B.A. from the University of Missouri
in 1936 and, two years later, a B.S. In 1940 he graduat-
ed from Harvard Medical School and became a resi-
dent physician in bacteriology at the Children’s
Hospital Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. He
left briefly in 1942 to serve in the U.S. Army.
Robbins returned to the Children’s Hospital Medi-
cal Center and completed his work in 1948. For the
next two years he held a senior fellowship in viral dis-
eases at the National Research Council, working with
Dr. John F. ENDERS in the Research Division of Infec-
tious Diseases at the Children’s Hospital Medical Cen-
ter. He was also a member of the faculty of the
Harvard Medical School. While he was working with
Enders, Robbins chiefly studied the cultivation of
poliomyelitis virus in tissue culture. In 1954 he received
the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine, along with
Enders and Thomas WELLER for successfully cultivating
poliomyelitis virus in tissue cultures.
Robbins was an associate in pediatrics on the fac-
ulty of the Harvard Medical School; an associate in the
research division of infectious diseases, associate physi-
cian, and associate director of the isolation service at
the Children’s Hospital Medical Center; a research fel-
low in pediatrics at the Boston Lying-in Hospital; and
an assistant to the Children’s Medical Service, Mas-
sachusetts General Hospital.
In May 1952 he became professor of pediatrics at
Western Reserve University School of Medicine and
director of the department of pediatrics and contagious
diseases in the Cleveland Metropolitan General Hospi-
tal until 1966, and he served as a professor of pedi-
atrics (1952–80) and dean (1966–80) at the Case
Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleve-
land, Ohio. Over his long career he has been a member
of many scientific organizations.

edema characteristic of Chagas’ disease. Named for
Argentine physician Cecilio Romaña.
root
Part of the plant, found mostly underground,
that withdraws water and other nutrient from the soil
and sometimes accumulates reserves of nutrients.
root cap
A cap-shaped structure found on the tips or
ends of roots. They cover and protect the active grow-
ing region of the root known as the meristem.
root hair
Thin, hairlike extensions behind the root
tips in plants that are an extension of the root’s epider-
mis. They function as a large surface area to absorb
water and minerals.
root pressure
Forced water pressure in roots that
moves upward by the pumping of minerals into the
xylem.
Ross, Ronald (1857–1932) English Physician, Ento-
mologist
Ronald Ross was born on May 13, 1857, in
Almora, India, the son of Sir C. C. G. Ross, an English
army general. He lived in India until the age of eight
and then was sent to a boarding school in Southamp-
ton, England.
Ross began the study of medicine at St.
Bartholomew’s Hospital in London in 1875, passed
his exams in 1879, and entered the Indian Medical
298
rod cell

Service in 1881. Ross married Rosa Bessie Bloxam in
1889 and they had two sons and two daughters. He
began the study of malaria in 1892 after being
exposed to the sufferings of many while he lived in
India. In 1894 he began to make an experimental
investigation in India that mosquitoes were connected
with transmitting the disease. After two and a half
years of experimentation, on August 20, 1897, Ross
finally succeeded in demonstrating the life cycle of the
parasites of malaria in mosquitoes. He dubbed it
“Mosquito Day.” In 1898 he demonstrated the malar-
ial parasite (plasmodium) in the stomach of the
anopheles mosquito, and the following year, Ross
joined the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine
under the direction of Sir Alfred Jones and was sent 
to West Africa to continue his investigations. There 
he found the species of mosquitoes that convey the
deadly African fever.
In 1901 Ross was elected a fellow of the Royal
College of Surgeons of England and also a fellow of
the Royal Society (became vice president from 1911
to 1913). In 1902 His Majesty the King of Great
Britain appointed him a companion of the Most Hon-
orable Order of Bath. In 1911 he was elevated to 
the rank of knight commander of the same order. In
Belgium, he was made an officer in the Order of
Leopold II.
In 1902 the School of Tropical Medicine founded
a chair of tropical medicine in University College. The
Sir Alfred Jones’ Chair of Tropical Medicine, as it was
called, was given to Ross in 1902, which he retained
until 1912. He left Liverpool and was appointed
physician for tropical diseases at Kings College Hospi-
tal, London, a post that he held together with the
chair of tropical sanitation in Liverpool. He stayed
until 1917, when he was appointed consultant in
malariology to the War Office. He was elevated to 
the rank of knight commander, St. Michael and 
St. George, in 1918 and was later appointed consul-
tant in malaria to the Ministry of Pensions. In 1926
he assumed the post of director-in-chief of the Ross
Institute and Hospital of Tropical Diseases and
Hygiene. His admirers created the institute, and he
remained there until his death. He was also a presi-
dent of the Society of Tropical Medicine.
While his contributions were in the form of the
discovery
of 
the 
transmission 
of 
malaria 
by
mosquitoes, he also found time to write poetry and
plays and to paint. His poetic works gained him 
wide acclamation independent of his medical and
mathematical standing.
He received many honors in addition to receiving
the Nobel Prize in 1902 for his work in malaria, and
was given honorary membership of learned societies of
most countries of Europe and of many other conti-
nents. He received an honorary M.D. degree in Stock-
holm in 1910 at the centenary celebration of the
Caroline Institute. He was knighted in 1911.
His wife died in 1931. Ross died the following year,
after a long illness, at the Ross Institute, London, on
September 16, 1932, and was buried next to his wife.
rough ER
Rough endoplasmic reticulum, the system
of membranous interconnected folded sheets in the
cytoplasm of cells and in which ribosomes are con-
tained. It transports materials through the cell and pro-
duces cisternae (protein sacks) that are moved to the
Golgi body or into the cell membrane. There is also a
smooth ER that lacks ribosomes but contains enzymes
and produces and digests lipids and membrane pro-
teins; smooth ER buds off, forming vesicles from rough
ER, and moves newly made proteins and lipids to the
Golgi body and membranes.
See also CELL; SMOOTH ER.

royal jelly
A milky white creamy material, thick and
nutritious, secreted by the hypopharyngeal glands of
nurse bees and supplied to female larvae in royal cells.
Needed for the transformation of larvae into queens.
Queen bees live exclusively on royal jelly.
R plasmid
A plasmid is a mobile, extrachromoso-
mal, self-replicating DNA structure that is found in the
cells of bacteria. The R plasmid carries genes that
function to resist antibiotics. This is carried out by a
resistance transfer factor (RTF), the component of the
R plasmid that encodes the ability to conjugate and to
transfer DNA.
r-selection
Selection that shows a pattern of species
reproduction that is fast, with many offspring that
mature quickly; such species have short life spans and
little parental involvement in rearing.
rubisco

RIBULOSE-1,5-BISPHOSPHATE
CARBOXY-
LASE/OXYGENASE.
rubredoxin
An IRON–SULFUR PROTEIN without acid-
labile sulfur, in which an iron center is coordinated by
four sulfur-containing LIGANDs, usually cysteine. The
function, where known, is as an electron carrier.
See also ACID-LABILE SULFIDE; COORDINATION.
rubrerythrin
A protein assumed to contain both a
RUBREDOXINlike iron center and a HEMERYTHRINlike
dinuclear iron center.

ruminant
A polygastric (having more than one
digestive cavity) herbivorous animal has a stomach
divided into four chambers. Usually a hoofed, even-
toed, usually horned mammal, such as sheep, goats,
deer, elks, camels, antelope, giraffes, and cows, that
chew a cud consisting of regurgitated, partially
digested food. The four stomachs consist of the
rumen, the first large compartment from which food
is regurgitated after cellulose has been broken down
by the action of the symbiotic bacterial, protozoal,
and fungal populations in the rumen. The second
stomach or reticulum (or honeycomb) consists of
folds of the mucous membrane that form hexagonal
cells and joins the omasum or third stomach by the
reticulo-omasal orifice. The digested material in the
rumen and the reticulum is exchanged about every 50
to 60 seconds by a rhythmic cycle of contraction.
Some of the material from the reticulum also goes
into the omasum through the reticulo-omasal orifice.
The omasum, or third stomach, located between the
reticulum and the abomasum, has muscular leaves
that may serve an absorptive function. The aboma-
sum, or fourth stomach, of a ruminant is the true
digestive stomach. A ruminant can use cellulose as an
energy source because of fermentation by bacteria in
the rumen.
runner
A modified horizontal, aboveground stem,
e.g., strawberry.
rusts (Uredinales; Urediniomycetes)
Rusts are obli-
gate parasites, fungi, of vascular plants and cause eco-
nomic problems with food crops. Rusts can complete
their life cycle on one host (autoecious) or alternate
between two different hosts (heteroecious). Some eco-
nomically important rusts affect
barley stem rust—Puccinia graminis f. sp. secalis, 
P. graminis f. sp. tritici; leaf rust—P. hordei; stripe

the wind.
SA node (sinoatrial node)
A specialized cardiac tis-
sue connected to the autonomic nervous system and
found in the upper rear wall of the right atrium of the
heart, near the superior vena cava. Acts as the heart’s
pacemaker by speeding or slowing down the heart rate
when necessary. It generates a brief electrical impulse of
low intensity around 72 times each minute in a resting
adult, causing the contraction of two atria, which then
pushes blood into the ventricles.

The liquid part of a plant, e.g., sap from the
sugar maple.
saprobe
Any organism that obtains its nutrients and
energy from dead or decaying matter. Formerly called
saprophyte.

See SAPROBE.
sarcomere
The basic unit, a myofibril, of striated
muscle that causes it to contract. It is composed of
overlapping myosin (thick) and actin (thin) filaments
between two adjacent Z disks, (thin, dark disks that
traversely cross through and bisect the clear zone of a
striated muscle), giving it a characteristic striated look.
sarcophagous
Flesh eating, e.g., tiger shark. Another
term for carnivorous.
sarcoplasmic reticulum
A cellular organelle, a mod-
ified endoplasmic reticulum, that is found only in stri-
ated muscle cells and which stores calcium ATPase used
to trigger muscle contraction when stimulated.
saturated fatty acid
Fatty acid with a hydrocarbon
chain that contains no double bonds but has the maxi-
mum possible number of hydrogen atoms attached to
every carbon atom; it is “saturated” with hydrogen
atoms. A fatty acid is the building block of fat, and it
exists mostly solid at room temperature. It raises the
blood LDL cholesterol (“bad” cholesterol) level.
savanna
A biome that is characterized by a flat
extensive cover of tall grasses, often three to six feet tall,
with scattered trees and shrubs and large herbivores. It
is a transitional biome between forest dominates and
301
S

grassland dominates. A midlatitude variant, the park-
land, is located in the drier portions of the humid con-
tinental climate, such as the eastern United States.
Associated with climates having seasonal precipitation,
tropical wet and dry climate type, accompanied with a
seasonal drought. Found close to the equator and trop-
ical areas of Africa, Australia, and India.
scavenger

the nitrogen atom: R2C=NR’ (R’ ≠H).
schizophrenia
A form of mental illness with associ-
ated problems such as psychotic disorder characterized
by severe problems with a person’s thoughts, feelings,
or behavior; often includes delusions and/or hallucina-
tions. Men usually are affected in late teens or early
20s, while females are affected between their 20s and
30s. Mental health disorders account for four of the
top 10 causes of disability worldwide, and 2 million
American adults are affected by schizophrenia each
year.
school
A large group of similar fish swimming
together.
Schwann cells
Schwann cells are the supporting cells
of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) that wrap
themselves around nerve axons to form a myelin
sheath. A single Schwann cell makes up a single seg-
ment of an axon’s myelin sheath. They also assist in
cleaning up debris in the peripheral nervous system and
guide regrowth of PNS axons.
scientific method
The steps taken by a scientist after
he or she develops a hypothesis, tests its predictions
through experimentation, and then changes or discards
the hypothesis if the predictions are not supported by
the results.
sclereid
A type of sclerenchyma cell. Sclereids are
found throughout the plant body and are short, cubical
cells that can be living or dead at maturity and form part
of the shell and pits of fruits. Also called stone cells.
sclerenchyma cell
Cells that have a rigid secondary
cell wall and serve to support and protect plants. Often
dead at maturity and composed of lignin, they provide
structural support. Sclerenchyma tissue can be composed
of two different kinds of cells: sclereids and fibers.
screwworm
There are two, the Old World screw-
worm (Chrysomia bezziana) and the New World
screwworm (Cochliomyia hominivorax). Larvae of
screwworm flies are obligate parasites of mammals
(including humans). The larvae of the flies cause lesions
known as myiasis that can be fatal and causes serious
livestock production losses. The New World species has
been eliminated from the United States and several
Central American countries.
scrub typhus
A form of typhus caused by a microor-
ganism collectively called rickettsia (Orientia tsutsuga-
mushi with multiple serologically distinct strains) and
transmitted via chigger mites, by which they are trans-
mitted to humans and other animals. Fatality is as high
as 60 percent if not treated. Found in central, eastern,
and southeastern Asia; from southeastern Siberia and
northern Japan to northern Australia and Vanuatu, as
far west as Pakistan, to as high as 10,000 feet above
sea level in the Himalayan Mountains, and particularly
prevalent in northern Thailand. Restricted mainly to
adult workers who frequent scrub overgrown terrain or
other mite-infested areas, such as forest clearings, refor-
ested areas, new settlements, or even newly irrigated
desert regions.
secondary compound
Compounds that are not
directly a function in the process of growth and devel-
302
scavenger

opment in a plant but are parts of the normal part of a
plant’s metabolism. They often serve to discourage
being eaten by making the plant taste bad or have a
toxic effect. Examples of secondary compounds are
nicotine and caffeine.
secondary consumer (carnivore)
An organism in
one trophic level that eats a primary consumer, such as
a fox eating a hen.
secondary growth
Secondary growth occurs in
stems and roots and usually results in the thickening of
the diameter by the addition of vascular tissue. Used
also to describe an area of regrown forest.
secondary immune response
The immune response
that follows a second or subsequent encounter with a
particular antigen. Usually the response is more severe
than the PRIMARY IMMUNE RESPONSE.
secondary productivity
The rate of new biomass
production that is nutrient material synthesized by con-
sumers over a specific time frame in an ecosystem.
secondary structure
Level of structural organization
in proteins described by the folding of the polypeptide
chain into structural MOTIFs such as ALPHA HELIXes
and BETA SHEETs, which involve hydrogen bonding of
backbone atoms. Secondary structure is also formed in
NUCLEIC ACIDS, especially in single-stranded RNAs by
internal BASE PAIRING.
secondary succession
Ecological succession in com-
munities that have been disturbed, such as a forest
turned to an agricultural field that then reverts back to
forest; the natural recovery process from disturbance.
second 
law 
of 
thermodynamics
States 
that
entropy, a measure of disorder, increases in the universe
and is spontaneous. Elements in a closed system will
tend to seek their most probable distribution, and
entropy always increases. It is a measure of unusable
energy and a gauge of randomness or chaos within a
closed system. Also called the Law of Increased
Entropy. Along with the first law of thermodynamics,
these two laws serve as the fundamental principles of
physics.
See also FIRST LAW OF THERMODYNAMICS.
second messenger
An intracellular METABOLITE or
ion increasing or decreasing as a response to the stimu-
lation of RECEPTORs by AGONISTs, considered as the
“first messenger.” This generic term usually does not
prejudge the rank order of intracellular biochemical
events.
sedimentary rock
A rock composed of sediment
that accumulated over millions of years in the bottom
of water bodies and is turned into rock by pressure
through the process of lithification. Sedimentary 
rock identification is primarily based on composition
and can be based on chemistry, fossil or organic 
composition, or clastics (small fragments of rock or
mineral).
seed
A structure produced by a terrestrial plant in
which the young embryo is encased in a protective cov-
ering and contains stored food.
segmentation
Being divided into segments, e.g.,
earthworms.
selection coefficient
A
measure
of the relative
strength of selection acting against a specific genotype.
It is calculated by subtracting each fitness value from
1.0. It is the cost associated with a given mutation on
an organism’s fitness.
selective permeability
Refers to the control a cell
membrane has over what can pass through it. The
membrane controls which specific molecules may enter
or leave the cell by using either PASSIVE TRANSPORT or
ACTIVE TRANSPORT or by way of a VESICLE.
selective permeability
303

self-incompatibility
The process in which plants
avoid inbreeding. It is the capacity for plants to block
fertilization by pollen from members of its own species
or closely related ones.
self-pollination
The deposit of pollen from the
anther of a flower to the stigma of the same flower or
to different flowers on the same plant; must be com-
plete flowers. Self-pollination is frequently prevented in
plants because it would result in inbreeding, and some
mechanisms have evolved to prevent it, such as imper-
fect flowers and dioecious plants. African violets and
orchids are often self-pollinators.
semelparity
The production of offspring where
organisms produce all of their offspring over a short
time in one single reproductive event.
semen
The fluid that contains sperm and glandular
secretions that is ejaculated from a male during
orgasm.
semicircular canals
Three small tubes in the inner
ear that maintain equilibrium and allow an organism to
detect changes in movement (acceleration) in a front-to-
back, up-and-down, and side-to-side motion by using
hair cells that detect movements of the fluid in the
canals. The canals are connected to the auditory nerve.
semilunar valve
Two valves, or connective tissue,
around the origin of the aorta (aortic valve) and begin-
ning of the pulmonary artery (pulmonary valve). Each
valve is composed of three flaps of tissue that maintain
the unidirectional blood flow and prevent blood from
reentering the ventricles during diastole.
seminiferous tubules
Highly convoluted channels in
the testes, where male sperm is produced. The sper-
matogonia, stem cells for spermatogenesis, are nour-
ished by Sertoli cells in the tubules, which also serve to
phagocytose damaged germ cells; provide a barrier
between the testis and blood; and produce mullerian
inhibition factor (MIF), inhibin, and androgen-binding
protein (ABP).
Interstitial cells, the Leydig cells between the
tubules, produce testosterone, the hormone responsible
for secondary sexual characteristics (e.g., facial and
pubic hair, male voice lowering at puberty). As the
sperm cells undergo meiosis and age, they migrate to
the center of the tubule and into the epididymus, locat-
ed on top of each testicle in the scrotum. The scrotum
keeps the testes about 2°C cooler than body tempera-
ture, increasing sperm production.
Inhibin, a polypeptide hormone produced in the
ovary and testes, regulates the release of follicle-stimu-
lating hormone (FSH) from the anterior pituitary and is
released by the Sertoli cells in the testes and granulosa
cells in the ovary. Androgens stimulate the release of
inhibin.
Total length of a seminiferous tubule is around 250
meters in one testis.
semipermeable
A membrane where some substances
will pass through but others will not.
sensation
The results of an impulse that is sent to the
brain when receptors and sensory neurons are activated.
sensory neuron
A specialized neuron that sends
messages that it receives from external or internal stim-
uli such as light, sound, smell, and chemicals to the
central nervous system.
sensory receptor
A cell or organ that converts a
stimulus from a form of sound, light, or thermal, chem-
ical, or mechanical stimulation into a signal, or action
potential, that can be transmitted through the organ-
ism. Sensory receptors are specific to the stimulus to
which they are responding and fall into specific types
such as chemoreceptors, photoreceptors, thermorecep-
tors, mechanoreceptors, and pain receptors, to name a
few. Each changes the polarization of the cell that may
eventually cause an action potential. Phasic receptors
send action potentials quickly when first stimulated
and then soon reduce the frequency of action poten-
tials, even if the stimulus continues, e.g., odor or pres-
304
self-incompatibility

sure. They are useful for signaling sudden changes in
the environment. Receptors that respond to light or
mechanics are tonic receptors and produce a constant
signal, after an initial amount of high-frequency action
potentials, while the stimulus is being applied.
sepal
A part of the calyx consisting of a whorl of
modified leaves that encloses and protects the flower
bud before it opens.
sequence
The order of neighboring amino acids in a
protein or the purine and pyrimidine bases in RNA or
DNA.

serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT)
A biogenic
monoamine 
(like 
histamine, 
epinephrine, 
nore-
pinephrine); a neurotransmitter and an important
vasoactive substance. A mediator of immediate hyper-
sensitivity. Serotonin is one of many mediators released
by circulating basophils and tissue mast cells. Found in
blood platelets, in the gastrointestinal tract, and in cer-
tain regions of the brain.
It plays a major role in blood clotting, stimulating
strong heart beats, initiating sleep, fighting depression,
and causing migraine headaches.

Light micrograph of sectioned Pacinian corpuscle (large circle,
center), a sensory receptor for touch. The corpuscle consists of
nerve endings surrounded by “onion-skin” membrane layers. 
The nerve cells are stimulated when the membranes are
deformed by changes in pressure. Pacinian corpuscles are 
especially sensitive to vibration. They are found in skin and in
some internal membranes. Magnification unknown. (Courtesy

Colored scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of human X (center)
and Y (lower right) sex chromosomes. Each chromosome has
replicated to form two identical strands (chromatids). The area
linking the chromatids is the centromere. The sex chromosomes
inherited during fertilization determine a person’s gender. Males
have an X and a Y chromosome (as seen here), while females
have two copies of the X chromosome. The Y chromosome carries
instructions for the development of male characteristics. The sex
chromosomes are one pair of the 23 pairs (present in most cells in
the body) that contain the DNA necessary for growth and develop-
ment. Magnification: ×7,150 at 6 × 7 cm size. (Courtesy © Andrew
Syred/Photo Researchers, Inc.)

there are two X chromosomes. In males, there is one Y
and one X. It is the presence of the Y chromosome that
leads to the development into a male.
sex-linked gene
A gene located on one of the sex
chromosomes. Some genetic diseases are located on a
sex gene. For example, hemophilia A, which is a blood-
clotting disorder caused by a mutant gene, is located on
the X chromosome. Genes located on the X chromo-
some are called X-linked, while genes located on the Y
chromosome are called Y-linked.
sexual dimorphism
The existence of noticeable
physical differences between males and females.
sexual reproduction
The creation of a new individ-
ual following the union of two gametes (e.g., egg and
sperm). In humans and most other eukaryotes, the two
gametes differ in structure (anisogamy) and are con-
tributed by different parents.
sexual selection
Sexual selection based on sec-
ondary sex characteristics and on the success of 
certain individuals over others in relation to the propa-
gation of the species and the enhancement of sexual
dimorphism.
Sherrington, Charles Scott (1857–1952) English
Neurophysiologist
Charles Scott Sherrington was
born on November 27, 1857, in Islington, London, to
James Norton Sherrington and Anne Brookes. He
attended Ipswich Grammar School from 1870 to 1875
and in 1876 began medical studies at St. Thomas’s
Hospital. In 1879 he went to Cambridge, where he
studied physiology under the “father of British physiol-
ogy,” Sir Michael Foster (1836–1907). He was profes-
sor of physiology at the Universities of Liverpool and
London and at Oxford.
From 1891 to 1897 he conducted research on the
nervous system, the efferent nerve (part of the peripher-
al nervous system, not in the brain or spinal cord) sup-
ply of muscles, and discovered that about one-third of
the nerve fibers in a nerve supplying a muscle are effer-
ent, the remainder being motor. He explained proprio-
ception, the function of the nerve synapse, a word he
created. He received the 1932 Nobel Prize in physiolo-
gy or medicine with E. D. ADRIAN for their discoveries
regarding the function of the neuron.
In 1906 he published his well-known book The
Integrative Action of the Nervous System. His other
books include Mammalian Physiology: A Course of
Practical Exercises, 1919; The Brain and Its Mecha-
nism, 1933; and Man on His Nature, 1940.
In 1913 he became the Waynfleet professor of
physiology at Oxford, a post he held until his retire-
ment in 1936. He died suddenly of heart failure at
Eastbourne in 1952.
shock
A
life-threatening condition where blood
pressure is too low to sustain life. Occurs when a low
blood volume (due to severe bleeding, excessive fluid
loss, or inadequate fluid uptake), inadequate pumping
action of the heart, or excessive dilation of the blood
vessel walls (vasodilation) causes low blood pressure.
This in turn results in inadequate blood supply to
body cells, which can quickly die or be irreversibly
damaged.
Anaphylactic shock is the severest form of allergy,
which is a medical emergency; a Type I reaction accord-
ing to the Gell and Coombs classification. An often
severe and sometimes fatal systemic reaction in a sus-
ceptible individual upon exposure to a specific antigen
(such as wasp venom or penicillin) following previous
sensitization. Characterized especially by respiratory
symptoms, fainting, itching, urticaria, swelling of the
throat or other mucous membranes, and a sudden
decline in blood pressure.
shoot system
The aboveground system of stems,
leaves, and flowers.
short-day plant
A plant that flowers when the days
are short; requires less than 12 hours of daylight to
bloom or long periods of darkness before it can bloom,
e.g., poinsettia.

sex-linked gene

sib
Short for sibling, a brother or sister.
sibling species
Species that are closely related and
are so similar morphologically that it is difficult to dis-
tinguish between them.
sickle cell
A genetically inherited disease where
defective hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying pigment in
red blood cells, causes sickling (distortion) as well as
becoming hard and sticky, resulting in loss of red blood
cells and causing anemia. There are three types in the
United States: hemoglobin SS or sickle-cell anemia,
hemoglobin SC disease, and hemoglobin sickle beta-
thalassemia. While anyone can get sickle-cell anemia,
8.5 percent of the African-American population carry
the trait but do not have the disease. One out of 400
African Americans has sickle cell, and sickle cell affects
eight out of every 100,000 people.
siderophore
Generic term for Fe(III)-complexing
compounds released into the cell medium by bacteria
for the purpose of scavenging iron.
See also SCAVENGER.
sieve-tube member
Living elongated cells arranged
in chains that form sieve tubes in phloem. Transports
sucrose, amino acids, other food materials, and hor-
mones throughout the plant.
signal peptide
A sequence of amino acids that deter-
mines the location of a protein in a eukaryotic cell.
signal transductions pathway
Signal transduction
refers to the movement of signals from outside the cell
to the inside and is a mechanism connecting the stimu-
lus to a cellular response.
sign stimulus
A stimulus or releaser such as an envi-
ronmental cue that elicits a fixed action response. If the
sign is not present, then the instinct will not occur.
sink habitat
A habitat where deaths are greater than
births and where the population would cease to exist
without immigration from more productive habitats.
See also SOURCE HABITAT.
sinus
Sinus means “cavity,” and many structures of
the human body are thus called sinuses. However, the
term generally refers to the paranasal sinus. The sinuses
(paranasal sinuses) are air cavities within the facial
bones. They are lined by mucous membranes similar to
those in other parts of the airways. The paranasal
sinuses consist of the ethmoid sinus, frontal sinus, max-
illary sinus, and sphenoid sinus.
An inflammation of the sinuses is called sinusitis.
siroheme
A HEMElike PROSTHETIC GROUP found in a
class of ENZYMEs that catalyze the six-electron reduc-
tion of sulfite and nitrite to sulfide and ammonia,
respectively.
See also NITRITE REDUCTASE; SULFITE REDUCTASE.
sister chromatids
Two identical copies of a single
chromosome that are connected by a centromere. After a
dividing cell has duplicated its chromosomes, it does not
separate the copies until it is positive that duplication was
a complete success and that the duplicated copies have
been lined up correctly. While the chromosomes are
duplicated in S phase, the two copies or sister chromatids
are kept together until later, when they are pulled apart
at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition during mitosis.
The sister chromatids are pulled to opposite halves of the
cell by microtubules coming from spindle poles located at
opposite sides of the cell. Sister chromatids segregate
away from each other because their kinetochores attach
to microtubules emanating from opposite poles.

site-specific delivery
An approach to target a DRUG
to a specific tissue using PRODRUGs or antibody recog-
nition systems.
skeletal muscle
Striated muscle attached to the
skeleton; contraction is under voluntary control. A sin-
gle skeletal muscle is attached at its origin to a large
area of bone, while at the other end the insertion tapers
into a tendon.
skeleton
A set of bones or cartilage, ligaments, and
tendons that acts as a frame and holds the body and its
organs together while also allowing locomotion.
Endoskeletons are within the body, while exoskeletons
surround the outside of the body.
sliding filament model
An explanation as to why
muscular contraction occurs. During muscular contrac-
tion, thin (actin) filaments within the sarcomere of a
myofibril are pulled toward the center of the sarcomere
(called the H zone) by the thick (myosin) filaments; the
two myofilaments slide past each other, increasing over-
lap. During this process, the sarcomere’s length short-
ens, the myofibril shortens, and the muscle contracts.
slugs
Snails without shells. Slugs are mollusks belong-
ing to the class Gastropoda. Several species of slugs are
frequently damaging to gardens and flowers, including
the gray garden slug (Peroceras reticulatum), the band-
ed slug (Limax poirieri), and the greenhouse slug (Milax
gagates). Slugs are hermaphrodites, and there are at
least 40 species of slugs in the United States.
small nuclear ribonucleoprotein (snRNP)
A com-
bination of nuclear RNA and protein that is part of the
spliceosome, the intron-removing structure in the nuclei
of eukaryotes. Introns are DNA segments within a gene
that interrupt the coding sequence of the gene. SnRNPs
are not fully understood.
smooth ER
Smooth ER is part of the endoplasmic
reticulum that does not contain ribosomes and is a

site-specific delivery
Computer artwork of the human skeletal system. The 206 bones of
the skeleton provide protection and support, and their joints
allow locomotion. The skull (at top) protects the brain. The ribs of
the chest (at upper center) enclose the heart and lungs. The pelvis
(at center) protects the lower abdominal organs. The flexible
backbone runs from the skull to the pelvis and protects the spinal
cord. The long leg and arm bones provide support. The humerus
(upper-arm bone) articulates with the radius and ulna (lower-arm
bones) at the elbow. The femur (thigh bone) articulates with the
fibula and tibia (lower-leg bones) at the knee. (Courtesy © Roger
Harris/Photo Researchers, Inc.)

system of membranous sacs and tubules (cisternae).
Protein molecules move from the rough ER into the
smooth ER, which forwards them as enclosed vesi-
cles, usually to the Golgi complex. Smooth ER func-
tions in metabolic processes: the synthesis of lipids,
carbohydrate metabolism, and the detoxification of
drugs and other toxins. Enzymes in the smooth ER
deal with synthesis of fats, phospholipids, steroids,
and other lipids, and they serve to detoxify drugs and
other toxins in the liver cells so they can be dis-
charged from the body. In muscle cells, the smooth
ER stores calcium that is released upon stimulation to
effect cell contraction.
See also ROUGH ER.
smooth muscle
Smooth muscle is composed of sin-
gle, spindle-shaped cells that have no visible striations.
Each smooth muscle cell contains thick (myosin) and
thin (actin) filaments that slide against each other to
produce contraction of the cell and are anchored near
the plasma membrane. Smooth muscle contraction is
slower than that of striated muscle and can be sus-
tained for long periods of time. Smooth muscle can be
found in blood vessels, the gastrointestinal tract,
bronchi of the lungs, the bladder, and the uterus.
Smooth muscle is primarily under the control of the
autonomic nervous system.
smuts
Smuts are a group of organisms, along 
with rusts, belonging to the microfungi, class Usto-
mycetes. Microfungi also include molds and mildews.
Smuts are parasites that appear on plants such as
grain, corn, and other economically important 
plants as small galls that break open and spread
spores. In the United States, about 13,000 species of
microfungi on plants or plant products have been
described.
society
An
interdependent system of organisms,
plant or animal; in insects, two or more individuals
that constitute a social unit (bee hive, ant hill).
sociobiology
The study of the behavior of social ani-
mals, including humans, with a premise that genetics is
the sole factor responsible for the behavior in humans
and animals.
sodium-potassium 
pump
An
active 
transport
mechanism of cell membranes to regulate pressure
between the inside and outside of the cell and to pump
potassium ions into the cell and keep sodium out,
thereby preventing water retention and swelling within
the cell. The sodium-potassium pump also maintains
the electrical charge within each cell. ATP is used as the
energy source for the pump.

solute
Any dissolved substance in a solution.
solution
Any liquid mixture of two or more sub-
stances that is homogeneous. A solution can be basic,
that is, have more OH– ions than H+ ions with a pH
greater than 7, or it can be acidic with more H+ ions
and have a pH lower than 7.
solvation
Any stabilizing interaction of a solute (or
solute moiety) and the solvent, or a similar interaction
of solvent with groups of an insoluble material (e.g.,
the ionic groups of an ion-exchange resin). They gener-
ally involve electrostatic forces and Van der Waals
forces, as well as more specific chemical effects such as
hydrogen bond formation.
solvent

scopic eggs and sperm being discharged into water at
the same location; common among fish. A spawning
ground is the location where the female fish lays its
eggs and the male fertilizes them.

in which an element occurs in both nonliving and living
systems. It can also refer to the quantitative distribu-
tion of an element. In biology, it refers to the origina-
tion of a new species.
See also BIOAVAILABILITY.
species

sharing a large degree of similarity in independent fea-
tures that interbreed and are reproductively isolated
from other such groups. One of the levels of scientific
classification in a taxonomic hierarchy that includes
the genus, family, order, class, phylum, and kingdom.

the intensity of light versus its wavelength.
Spemann, Hans (1869–1941) German Embryologist
Hans Spemann was born on June 27, 1869, in Stuttgart
to the publisher Wilhelm Spemann. From 1878 until
1888 he went to the Eberhard-Ludwig School at
Stuttgart, left school in 1888, and spent a year in his
father’s publishing business.
In 1891 he entered the University of Heidelberg
after spending his military service from 1889 to 1890.
He studied at the University of Munich during the win-
ter of 1893–94, and from the spring of 1894 to the end
of 1908 he worked in the Zoological Institute at the
University of Würzburg.
In 1895 he took his Ph.D. degree in zoology,
botany, and physics, and three years later was qualified
as a lecturer in zoology at the University of Würzburg.
In 1908 he was asked to become professor of zoology
and comparative anatomy at Rostock, and in 1914 he
became associate director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Insti-
tute of Biology at Berlin-Dahlem. In 1919 he was
appointed professor of zoology at the University of
Freiburg-im-Breisgau, a post that he held until he
retired in 1935, then becoming emeritus professor.
Spemann’s work was in experimental embryology,
focusing on the differentiation of embryo cells during
an organism’s development. He was an expert in micro-
surgical technique. He worked on amphibian eggs and
in 1924 discovered that a part of an embryo, when
transplanted to other regions of the embryo, causes a
change in the surrounding tissues. Those parts were
named “organizer center” or “organizer” by him. The
so-called organizer effect was the dominant topic in
embryological research during the 1930s, and for this
discovery he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1935.
Spemann laid the foundations of the theory of
embryonic induction by organizers, which led to bio-
chemical studies of this process and the ultimate devel-
opment of the modern
science of experimental
morphogenesis. He even conducted one of the first
cloning experiments on a salamander. He described his
researches in his book Embryonic Development and
Induction
(1938). Spemann died at Freiburg on
September 9, 1941.
sperm

duced by sexually reproducing male eukaryotes.
See also SEMEN.
spermatogenesis
The development of sperm cells in
the tubules of the testes from spermatogonium.

(S) in a cell so that new cells forming will have the cor-
rect amount of DNA. One part of a five-part process in
cell division.
See also MITOSIS.
sphincter
A ringlike muscle that surrounds a natural
opening and closes it by contraction.
spiders
Members of the class Arachnida, order
Araneae, and one of the most feared organisms by
humans. There are more than 30,000 species of spiders
belonging to 105 families. All arachnids have four pairs
of walking legs and fangs (chelicerae) adapted for liq-
uid feeding. They lack jaws or other types of feeding
structures.
All spiders have spinnerets, small fingerlike
appendages at the end of their abdomen, that secrete
silk during all stages of life. The silk is used for captur-
ing prey, rearing young, mobility, making shelter, and
for spinning webs. Spiders mate when the male trans-
fers sperm to the female using pedipalps, specially mod-
ified appendages near the mouth. Some spiders are
poisonous, and all are predators, eating many different
kinds of insects.
spina bifida (myelomeningocele)  A neural-tube defect,
a birth defect, that results in the failure of the bones of
the spine, usually at the bottom of the spinal cord, to
close during the first month of pregnancy. Paralysis is
the usual condition, along with no control of some
spina bifida
311

other organs such as bowel and bladder. Mental retar-
dation can also occur. It affects approximately one out
of every 1,000 newborns in the United States and is the
most frequent disabling birth defect.
spindle
A group of microtubules originating from
the centriole that move chromosomes during cell divi-
sion in eukaryotic cells. Spindles attach at the kineto-
chore—a region on the centromere, the area that joins
chromatids.
spin label
A
STABLE paramagnetic group that is
attached to a part of another molecular entity whose
microscopic environment is of interest and can be
revealed by the ELECTRON PARAMAGNETIC RESONANCE
spectrum of the spin label. When a simple paramagnet-
ic molecular entity is used in this way without covalent
attachment to the molecular entity of interest, it is fre-
quently referred to as a spin probe.
spin-orbit coupling
The interaction of the electron-
spin magnetic moment with the magnetic moment due
to the orbital motion of the electron.
spin probe
See SPIN LABEL.
spin-spin coupling
The interaction between the spin
magnetic moments of different electrons and/or nuclei.
In NMR spectroscopy it gives rise to multiple patterns
and crosspeaks in two-dimensional NMR spectra.
Between electron and nuclear spins, this is termed the
nuclear HYPERFINE interaction. Between electron spins,
it gives rise to relaxation effects and splitting of the elec-
tron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectrum.

spin trapping
In certain solution reactions, a tran-
sient RADICAL
will interact with a DIAMAGNETIC
reagent to form a more “persistent” radical. The prod-
uct radical accumulates to a concentration where detec-
tion and, frequently, identification are possible by
ELECTRON PARAMAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY.
The key reaction is usually one of attachment; the dia-
magnetic reagent is said to be a “spin trap,” and the
persistent product radical is then the “spin adduct.”
spiral cleavage
An embryonic development charac-
teristic of protostomes. The developing embryo under-
goes cell division (cleavage) from a four-cell embryo to
an eight-cell embryo, with the cells dividing at slight
angles to one another. None of the four cells in one
plane of the eight-cell stage is directly over a cell in the
other plane (oblique to polar axis).
See also RADIAL CLEAVAGE.
spirochetes
Long, slender, coiled (looks like a tele-
phone cord) bacteria that cause disease and are sym-
bionts in the stomachs of ruminants. Spirochetes can be
aerobic or anaerobic, free-living or parasitic. All spiro-
chetes are chemoheterotrophs. Three genera exist, Lep-
tospira (cause icterohemorrhagic fever), Treponema
(cause syphilis), and Borrelia (cause Lyme disease).
spleen
The spleen is located in the upper left quad-
rant of the abdomen. It has two main functions, acting
as part of the immune system and as a filter. There are
two distinct components of the spleen, the red pulp and
the white pulp. It plays an important role in immune
system activities as part of the lymphatic system.
spliceosome
A complex of several snRNA molecules
(small nuclear RNA) and proteins that remove introns
(noncoding mRNA) and splice exons (remaining
mRNA sequences).
splitter
A taxonomist who prefers to create taxo-
nomic categories that are narrowly defined, thus end-
ing up with more genera than a lumper, who prefers to
place closely related genera into a single genus.
See also LUMPER.
sporangium
A tiny closed globe or capsule located
on a sporangiophore in which sporangiospores and
312
spindle

haploid spores (asexual) are produced by meiosis in
fungi and other plants.
spore
The reproductive organ in cryptogams (ferns,
mosses, fungi, and algae), which functions like a seed
but has no embryo. In alternation of generations, it
germinates and produces a gametophyte in ferns and
mosses. It is the reproductive unit encased in a protec-
tive coat of a fungus. Usually environmentally resistant
and can lay dormant for many years.
See also SPOROPHYTE.
sporophyte
The phrase alternation of generations
refers to the way in which the diploid and haploid
stages in a plant’s life cycle take different and distinct
forms. The diploid stage is called the sporophyte and
the haploid stage the gametophyte. The diploid sporo-
phyte phase results from a union of gametes that mei-
otically produces haploid spores. The haploid
gametophyte phase develops following meiosis and
develops mechanisms for fertilization by producing
and accepting gametes. The haploid, gamete-produc-
ing vegetative phase is the gametophyte, and the
diploid, spore-producing vegetative phase is the
sporophyte.
See also GAMETOPHYTE.
sporopollenin
An acetolysis resistant biopolymer
that makes up most of the material of the exine, an
outer layer of the wall of pollen grains and spores that
is highly resistant to acids and bases. A granule of
sporopollenin is called an orbicule.
spotted fever (Rocky Mountain spotted fever)
A
disease caused by Rickettsia rickettsii and transmitted
by ticks. Confined to the Western Hemisphere and
found in all states in the United States with the excep-
tion of Maine, Hawaii, and Alaska. Dermacentor
andersoni (the wood tick) is the usual vector in the
western United States, while D. variabilis (dog tick) is
the vector in the eastern and southern United States.
Without treatment, fatality is about 20 percent, but
antibiotics reduces the rate if treated early.
See also RICKETTSIA.
square plane
See COORDINATION.
stability constant
An
equilibrium constant that
expresses the propensity of a species to form from its
component parts. The larger the stability constant, the
more STABLE the species. The stability constant (forma-
tion constant) is the reciprocal of the instability con-
stant (dissociation constant).
stabilizing selection
A form of natural selection
that favors maintaining existing character traits in a
population and eliminating those individuals who
exhibit extreme variations of a trait. While it main-
tains the existing state of adaptation and exhibits the
highest fitness, it results in an overall decrease in
genetic diversity.
stable
A term describing a system in a state of equi-
librium corresponding to a local minimum of the
appropriate thermodynamic potential for the specified
constraints on the system. Stability cannot be defined
in an absolute sense, but if several states are in princi-
ple accessible to the system under given conditions,
then that with the lowest potential is called the stable
state, while the other states are described as metastable.
Unstable states are not at a local minimum. Transitions
between metastable and stable states occur at rates that
depend on the magnitude of the appropriate activation
energy barriers separating them.
stamen
The male organ of a pollen-bearing flower.
See also OVULE.
starch
A polysaccharide containing glucose (long-
chain polymer of amylose and amylopectin) that is the
energy storage reserve in plants.
stasipatric speciation
A form of speciation where
new species are created as a result of chromosomal
rearrangements or mutations (translocations, inver-
sions, changes in chromosome numbers). Reproductive
isolation occurs, and new species develop.

statocyst
A vesicle, organ of balance, or mechanore-
ceptor in invertebrates that serves to regulate equilibri-
um by using statoliths, a granule of sand or limestone
that responds to gravity by stimulating sensory cells
when an animal is in motion.
statoliths
Equilibrium organs; starch grains in plant
cells that act as a gravity sensor. Found in root-tip cells
or tissues close to vascular bundles.
steady state
If, during the course of a chemical reac-
tion, the concentration of an intermediate remains con-
stant, the intermediate is said to be in a steady state. In a
static system, a reaction intermediate reaches a steady
state if the processes leading to its formation and those
removing it are approximately in balance. The steady-
state hypothesis leads to a great simplification in reaching
an expression for the overall rate of a composite reaction
in terms of the rate constants for the individual elemen-
tary steps. Care must be taken to apply the steady-state
hypothesis only to appropriate reaction intermediates. An
intermediate such as an atom or a free RADICAL, present
at low concentrations, can usually be taken to obey the
hypothesis during the main course of the reaction. In a
flow system, a steady state can be established even for
intermediates present at relatively high concentrations.

limeters) and is located between both Bowman’s and
Decemet’s membrane.
stromatolite
Stromatolites are colonies of millions
of single-cell cyanobacteria (formerly known as blue-
green algae). Stromatolites are so far the oldest known
fossils, dating back well over 3 billion years. They
were the dominant life-form for 2 billion years and
still persist today on the west coast of Australia. One
of the largest exposures of fossilized stromatolites is
the Petrified Sea Gardens in Saratoga Springs, New
York. It is listed as one of America’s National Historic
Landmarks, designated in 1999 by the Secretary of the
U.S. Department of the Interior. It is a 500-million-
year-old ocean reef from a time when the land that is
now Saratoga Springs was at the shore of a warm
tropical sea.
Stromatolites are also known as “stone cabbage,”
based on their fossil appearance.

particular interest, the reaction of which with some
other chemical reagent is under observation (e.g., a
compound that is transformed under the influence of
a catalyst). It can also be the chemical entity whose
conversion to a product or products is catalyzed by an
ENZYME. Also a solution or dry mixture containing all

subunit
An individual polypeptide chain in a pro-
tein containing more than one polypeptide chain. Dif-
ferent types of subunits are frequently designated by
α, ß, γ, etc.
succession
The process whereby species are replaced
over time in an ecological community. Primary succes-
sion is when new communities develop on newly
exposed habitat that has no previous life forms, such as
on bare rock. Secondary succession is when communi-
ties take over an area that previously supported life,
such as a recently burned forest or abandoned agricul-
tural land. Succession usually occurs in one direction
and often can be predicted. However, predictable suc-
cession can be altered, such as in fire disclimax commu-
nities like pine barrens, where fire periodically burns
out species that would, if left unchecked, succeed to a
new community type.

stems, roots, or leaves that store water, thus preventing
desiccation in harsh, dry environments, e.g., cactus,
aloe.

superoxide dismutase), or iron (Fe-superoxide dismu-
tase), or manganese (Mn-superoxide dismutase).
See also DISPROPORTIONATION.
suppressor T cell (T8 cell; CD8 cell)
The existence
of these cells is a relatively recent discovery, and their
function is still somewhat debated. The basic concept
of suppressor T cells is a cell type that specifically sup-
presses the action of other cells in the immune system,
notably B cells and T cells, thereby preventing the
establishment of an immune response. How this is
done is not known with certainty, but it seems that cer-
tain specific antigens can stimulate the activation of the
suppressor T cells. This suppressor effect is thought to
be mediated by some inhibitory factor secreted by sup-
pressor T cells. The factor is not any of the known lym-
phokines. Another fact that renders the study of this
cell type difficult is the lack of a specific surface mark-
er. Most suppressor T cells are CD8-positive, as are
cytotoxic T cells.
supramolecular chemistry
This is defined as the
chemistry of molecular assemblies and of the inter-
molecular bond—“chemistry beyond the molecule”—
bearing on the organized entities of higher complexity
that result from the association of two or more chemi-
cal species held together by intermolecular forces.
Thus, supramolecular chemistry can be considered to
represent a generalized

molecules. Surface tension is typically measured in
dyne/cm, the force in dynes required to break a film of
length 1 cm. Water at 20°C has a surface tension of
72.8 dyne/cm. Surfactants act to reduce the surface ten-
sion of a liquid.
survivorship curve
Summarizes the pattern of sur-
vival in a population. There are basically three types of
survivorship curve
317

survivorship curves: Type I applies to species having a
high survival rate of the young, where most of the indi-
viduals of the population survive to maturity and die in
old age, such as humans. Type II species have a rela-
tively constant death rate throughout their life span,
such as fish and large birds. Type III curves are found
in species that have many young, most of which die
very early in their life, such as plants. Most type III off-
spring die before they reach reproductive age.
suspension
Particles mixed with, but undissolved, in
a fluid or solid.
suspension feeder (suspensivores)
An organism that
obtains food by capturing organic matter suspended in
the water. Those that use a filter to capture food are
called filter feeders. A mucous-bag suspension feeder
uses a sheet or bag of mucous to trap particles, while a
tentacle-tube-foot suspension feeder traps particles on
distinct tentacles or tube feet.
sustainable
A process that can continue indefinitely
without overusing resources and causing damage to the
environment.
sustainable agriculture
Agricultural techniques and
systems that, while economically viable to meet the
need to provide safe and nutritious foods, utilize
nonenvironmentally destructive methods such as the
use of organic fertilizers, biological control of pests
instead of pesticides, and minimized use of nonrenew-
able fuels.
sustainable development
Development and eco-
nomic growth that meets the requirements of the pre-
sent generation without compromising the ability of
future generations to meet their needs. Seeks a balance
between development and conservation of natural
resources.
Sutherland, Earl W., Jr. (1915–1974) American
Pharmacologist
Earl Sutherland was born on Novem-
ber 19, 1915, in Burlingame, Kansas. He received a
B.S. from Washburn College in 1937 and an M.D.
from Washington University School of Medicine in St.
Louis in 1942.
Sutherland joined the faculty of Washington Uni-
versity, and in 1953 he became director of the depart-
ment of medicine at Western Reserve University in
Cleveland, Ohio. Here he discovered cyclic AMP
(adenosine monophosphate) in 1956.
In 1963 he became professor of physiology at Van-
derbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. He was
awarded the 1971 Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine for isolation of cyclic adenosine monophos-
phate (cyclic AMP) and for demonstrating its involve-
ment in numerous animal metabolic processes. From
1973 until his death he was a member of the faculty of
the University of Miami Medical School.
He died on March 9, 1974, in Miami, Florida. The
Earl Sutherland Prize award is presented annually by
the chancellor of Vanderbilt University to a Vanderbilt
faculty member who has made a nationally recognized
impact in a particular discipline.
swim bladder (air bladder)
An organ—a gas-filled
sac—that lies in the upper body cavity of many bony
fishes; functions as a ballast tank by creating buoyancy;
also used in respiration and as a sound organ.
symbiont
One of the members of a symbiotic 
relationship.
symbiosis
A
mutually 
beneficial 
relationship
between two or more different kinds of organisms in
direct contact with each other.
See also MUTUALISM.
sympathetic division
One of two divisions of the
autonomic nervous system—the sympathetic and
parasympathetic—that regulates involuntary func-
tions. The sympathetic division prepares the body for
survival response while under stress and increases
energy use; autonomic motor neurons release the neu-
rotransmitter 
norepinephrine, 
which 
accelerates
heartbeats, constricts or dilates blood vessels, dilates

the bronchi, and inhibits digestion. The sympathetic
division opposes the actions of the parasympathetic
division.
sympatric speciation
The creation of a new species
within a geographical area caused by reproductive iso-
lation among individuals coexisting in the area.
symplast
The interconnected protoplasm between
cells in a plant due to the presence of pores between the
cells that allow cytoplasmic flow (plasmadesmata).
symplesiomorph
A character state shared by two or
more taxa thought to have originated as an evolution-
ary novelty in an earlier ancestor.
symptom

plaint reported by an individual. For example, a rash is
a symptom that the immune system is reacting to some-
thing such as dust.
syn
See ANTI.
synapomorphy
A derived or specialized character
(apomorphy) that is shared by two or more groups that
originated in their last common ancestor; used to infer
common ancestry.
synapse
A gap or junction between the ends of two
neurons in a neural pathway where nerve impulses pass
from one to the other; an impulse causes the release of
a neurotransmitter at the synapse that diffuses across
the gap and triggers the next neuron’s electrical
impulse.
See also NEURON.
synapsis
The alignment of chromosomes during
prophase of the first division in meiosis so that each
chromosome is next to its homologue; the time when
crossing over occurs.
synaptic terminal (synaptic vesicle)

bulb at the end of an axon terminal that stores and
releases neurotransmitters.
syndrome
A group of symptoms and diseases that
together are characteristic of a specific condition.
synergism
The combination of two or more sub-
stances in which the sum result of this combination is
greater than the effects that would be exhibited from
each of the individual substances alone.
syngamy
When male and female gametes meet and
join. Same as sexual reproduction.
synonyms
One of several different scientific names
that are spelled differently but refer to the same species.
An example is Epilobium canum (E. Greene) Raven
and Zauschneria californica K. Presl. The older name is
the senior synonym and is how the species thenceforth
is referred once the synonymy has been recognized. The
more recent name is the junior synonym and its use is
discontinued.
synthase
An ENZYME that catalyzes a reaction in
which a particular molecule is synthesized, not neces-
sarily by formation of a bond between two molecules
(contrast with synthetase).
See also LIGASE.

genetic relationships among organisms.
systematics
319

systemic
Relating to or affecting the whole body.
systemic acquired resistance (SAR)
A defensive
response in infected plants characterized by an activa-
tion of a number of defense mechanisms. The mecha-
nisms are activated at the site where the pathogen
attacks and in tissues untouched by the pathogen.
SAR provides resistance against a host of organisms
such as fungi, bacteria, and viruses. Also called
induced resistance.
systole
Contraction of the heart; the period when
ventricles contract, pushing blood from the left ventri-
cle into the aorta and from the right ventricle into the
pulmonary artery. Systolic pressure is when the blood
pressure is measured during contraction of the heart. In
blood pressure readings, it is normally the higher of the
two measurements.
Szent-Györgyi, Albert von (1893–1986) Hungarian
Biochemist
Albert von Szent-Györgyi was born in
Budapest on September 16, 1893, to Nicolaus von
Szent-Györgyi, and Josefine, whose father,
Joseph
Lenhossék, and brother Michael were both professors
of anatomy in the University of Budapest.
He took his medical degree at the University of Sci-
ences in Budapest in 1917, and in 1920 became an
assistant at the University Institute of Pharmacology in
Leiden. From 1922 to 1926, he worked with H. J.
Hamburger at the Physiology Institute, Groningen,
Netherlands. In 1927, he went to Cambridge as a
Rockefeller fellow, working under F. G. HOPKINS, and
spent one year at the Mayo Foundation, Rochester,
Minnesota, before returning to Cambridge. In 1930 he
became chair of medical chemistry at the University of
Szeged, and five years later he also was chair in organic
chemistry. At the end of World War II, he was chair of
medical chemistry at Budapest.
Szent-Györgyi’s early researches concerned the
chemistry of cell respiration. He pioneered the study of
biological oxidation mechanisms and proved that hex-
uronic acid, which he isolated and renamed ascorbic
acid, was identical to vitamin C and that it could be
extracted from paprika. He won the 1937 Nobel Prize
in physiology or medicine for his discoveries, especially
of vitamin C.
In the late 1930s his work on muscle research
quickly led him to discover the proteins actin and
myosin and their complex. This led to the foundation
of muscle research in the following decades. He also
worked on cancer research in his later years. In 1947,
he moved to the United States, where he became direc-
tor of research, Institute of Muscle Research, Woods
Hole, Massachusetts.
His publications include Oxidation, Fermentation,
Vitamins, Health and Disease (1939), Muscular Con-
traction (1947), The Nature of Life (1947), Contrac-
tion in Body and Heart Muscle (1953), Bioenergetics
(1957), and The Crazy Ape in 1970, which was a com-
mentary on science and the future of the human race.
He died on October 22, 1986.

systemic

taiga
The far northern (50 to 60 degrees north lati-
tude) open region of the boreal forest encompassing
parts of Siberia, Eurasia, Scandinavia, and North
America, just south of the tundra. Characterized by
open coniferous woodlands composed of tamarack,
black or white spruce, fir, pine and larch, and a floor of
lichens. The boreal forests represent the largest terres-
trial biome where seasons alternate between long, cold
winters and short, cool summers. These forests have
acidic, thin soils and a growing season of 130 days.
The average temperature is below freezing for half of
the year.
tapeworms
One of the cestode worms (Cestoda),
flatworms that are internal parasites.
tarantula
A large hairy spider (arachnid) that lives in
warm areas such as South America, southern North
America, southern Europe, Africa, southern Asia, and
Australia, with the greatest concentration of tarantulas
in South America. There are about 300 species of
tarantulas. Aphonopelma and Cyrtopholis are repre-
sentative genera. The female can live over 30 years, but
the life span of the male is considerably shorter.
tardigrade
A microscopic animal that looks like a
miniature bear, hence the name water bear. They have
inflated round bodies with four pairs of stubby
clawed legs used for walking. If the environment dries
up, they have the ability to withstand hostile condi-
tions by undergoing a process called anhydrobiosis
(life without water), part of an adaptable technique of
cryptobiosis.
They are not affected by changes in salinity,
extreme vacuum, or lack of oxygen. They can survive
freezing or thawing in temperatures as cold as –328°F
or as hot as 304°F. When they turn into dried barrels
called tuns, they are able to survive for long periods of
time, and some have been brought back to life from
100-year-old mosses. Their typical environment is the
thin film of water that coats mosses and lichens, but
they have been found in a vast range of habitats. There
may be up to 1,000 species.
tautonym
A biological term where the genus and
species are the same word, such as Amoracia armora-
cia, or Rattus rattus (the black rat). Triple tautonyms
are common in biological nomenclature.
taxis
The behavior exhibited when an organism
reacts to an external stimulus by turning or moving
away from the stimulus.
taxon
A grouping of organisms by taxonomic rank,
such as order, family, genus, etc.; also a group of organ-
isms or other taxa sharing a single common ancestor.
321
T

taxonomy
The name of the discipline given to the
scientific study, naming, classification, and identifica-
tion of organisms.
T cell (T-lymphocyte)
A lymphocyte (white blood
cell) that develops in the bone marrow, matures in the
thymus, and expresses what appear to be antibody
molecules on its surface. Unlike B cells, these molecules
cannot be secreted. Also called a T-cell receptor (CD3
and CD4 or CD8). Works as part of the immune sys-
tem in the body. Produces cytokine to help B lympho-
cytes produce immunoglobulin.
Several distinct T-cell subpopulations are recognized:
helper T cell (T4 cell, CD4 cell) A class of T cells that
help trigger B cells to make antibodies against thy-
mus-dependent antigens. Helper T cells also help
generate cytotoxic T cells.
T killer cells (cytotoxic T cells) Cells that kill target
cells bearing appropriate antigen within the groove
of an MHC (major histocompatibility complex)
class I molecule that is identical to that of the T cell.
suppressor T cell (T8 cell, CD8 cell) The existence of
these cells is a relatively recent discovery, and their
function is still somewhat debated. The basic con-
cept of suppressor T cells is a cell type that specifi-
cally suppresses the action of other cells in the
immune system, notably B cells and T cells, thereby
preventing 
the 
establishment 
of 
an 
immune
response. How this is done is not known with cer-
tainty, but it seems that certain specific antigens can
stimulate the activation of the suppressor T cells.
This suppressor effect is thought to be mediated by
some inhibitory factor secreted by suppressor T
cells. The factor is not any of the known lym-
phokines. Another fact that renders the study of this
cell type difficult is the lack of a specific surface
marker. Most suppressor T cells are CD8-positive, as
are cytotoxic T cells.
telomerase 
(telomere
terminal 
transferase)
An
enzyme, known as an immortalizing enzyme, that is
composed of RNA and proteins that uses its RNA as a
template to synthesize telomeric DNA onto the ends of
chromosomes; acts as a reverse transcriptase, adding
telomeres to the chromosome ends when activated.
Found in germ and inflammatory cells, fetal tissue, and
tumor cells. When cells become cancerous, telomerase is
activated, and the cells can replicate without limits in a
process called immortalization.
telomere
The protective and stabilizing ends of lin-
ear chromosomes in eukaryotes that are involved in the
replication and stability of DNA molecules. Telomeres
erode slightly with each cell division unless TELO-
MERASE is activated.
telophase
The last stage in meiosis. Telophase I is the
stage where the migration of the daughter chromo-
somes to the two poles is completed. In telophase II,
the last stage of meiosis, a nuclear membrane forms
around each set of chromosomes, and cytokinesis (divi-
sion of the cytoplasm) takes place.
temperate deciduous forest
Located in the midlati-
tude areas between the polar regions and the tropics.
This biome has four seasons, the result of being
exposed to warm and cold air masses. The temperature
varies widely from season to season, with cold winters
and hot, wet summers. Most of the trees are broadleaf
trees such as oak, maple, beech, hickory, and chestnut.
Animals have adapted to the seasons through a variety
of strategies, including hibernating, migrating, or stay-
ing active.
temperate virus
A virus that does not necessarily kill
the host by lysis but that reproduces in synchrony with
the host, called a lysogen. When this process is occur-
ring the virus is called a prophage.
temperature
A measure of the energy in a substance.
The more heat energy in the substance, the higher the
temperature. A number of temperature scales have
evolved over time, but only three are used presently:
Fahrenheit, Celsius, and Kelvin. The Fahrenheit tem-
perature scale is a scale based on 32 for the freezing
point of water and 212 for the boiling point of water,
the interval between the two being divided into 180
parts. This scale is named after its inventor, the 18th-
322
taxonomy

century German physicist Daniel Gabriel FAHRENHEIT.
The Celsius or centigrade temperature scale is based on
0 for the freezing point of water and 100 for the boil-
ing point of water. This scale was invented in 1742 by
the Swedish astronomer Anders CELSIUS. It was once
called the centigrade scale because of the 100-degree
interval between the defined points. The Kelvin temper-
ature scale is the base unit of thermodynamic tempera-
ture measurement and is defined as 1/273.16 of the
triple point (equilibrium among the solid, liquid, and
gaseous phases) of pure water. The Kelvin is also the
base unit of the Kelvin scale, an absolute-temperature
scale named for the British physicist William Thomson,
Baron Kelvin. Such a scale has its zero point at abso-
lute zero, the theoretical temperature at which the
molecules of a substance have their lowest energy.
tendon (sinew)
A
fibrous connective tissue that
attaches muscles to bones; a collagen-rich substance.
tendril
A slender outgrowth of a plant stem that can
clasp or wind around and help support climbing plants.
tepuis
A unique ecological region in South America
(Venezuela, Guyana, Suriname, and Brazil) of about
19,000 square miles, famous for isolated mountains,
each called a tepui, with flat tops covered with species
that may not exist elsewhere. Thirty three percent of
the 2,300 vascular plants found there are endemic.
teratogen
A substance that produces a malformation
in a fetus.
territory
An area within the living range of an indi-
vidual animal that it will defend against intruders over
food or protection of its young.
tertiary consumer
Part of the food chain in which
the tertiary consumer (e.g., hawk) eats the secondary
consumer (e.g., snake), which eats the primary con-
sumer (e.g., mouse), which eats a producer (e.g., grass).
Carnivores that eat mainly other carnivores.
Tertiary period
The first period of the Cenozoic era
(after the Mesozoic era and before the Quaternary peri-
od), extending from 65 million to 1.8 million years ago.
See also GEOLOGICAL TIME.
tertiary structure
The overall three-dimensional
structure of a BIOPOLYMER. For proteins, this involves
the side-chain interactions and packing of SECONDARY
STRUCTURE motifs. For NUCLEIC ACIDS, this can be the
packing of stem loops or supercoiling of DOUBLE
HELIXES.
testcross
A cross of an individual with a potentially
ambiguous or unknown genotype to a homozygous
recessive individual.
testis (testes; testicle)
The male reproductive organ,
gonad, where sperm is and hormones (testosterone) are
produced; located inside the scrotum, behind and
below the penis.
See also SPERM.
testosterone
Male androgen hormone that regulates
male sexual characteristics along with dihydrotestos-
terone. Testosterone is converted to dihydrotestos-
terone by the enzyme 5-alpha-reductase. Testosterone is
converted to estradiol (the most potent estrogen,
formed in both the ovary and the testes) by the enzyme
17-ketoreductase.
tetanus (lockjaw)
A disease caused by the release of
exotoxins by a bacterium (clostridium tetani) that caus-
es muscular spasm, contraction, and convulsions;
obtained through a contaminated wound, e.g., from
stepping on a rusting nail. Also any tense muscle con-
traction by rapid and frequent action potentials (like
electric shocks). Approximately 30 percent of reported
cases of tetanus end in death. Tetanus kills 300,000
newborns and 30,000 birth mothers worldwide, from
lack of immunization.
tetrahedron
See COORDINATION.
tetrahedron

tetrahydrofolate
Reduced FOLATE derivative that
contains additional hydrogen atoms in positions 5, 6,
7, and 8. Tetrahydrofolates are the carriers of activat-
ed one-carbon units and are important in the biosyn-
thesis of amino acids and precursors needed for DNA
synthesis.
See also FOLATE COENZYMES.
tetrapod
Any vertebrate organism that has four
limbs, or two sets of limbs, e.g., mammals, reptiles,
birds, amphibians.
thalamus
Consists of two egg-shaped masses at the
base of the brain that form the dorsal subdivision of
the diencephalon (forebrain) and that function together
as a unit. The thalamus acts as switching relay, receiv-
ing sensory data from the nervous system and escorting
it to the cerebral cortex and other parts of the brain. In
botany, it is the receptacle or torus of a flower.
thalassemia
A chronic inherited disease character-
ized by defective synthesis of HEMOGLOBIN. Defective
synthesis of the α chain of hemoglobin is called α-tha-
lassemia, and defective synthesis of the ß chain of
hemoglobin is called ß-thalassemia. Thalassemias result
in anemia that can be severe and are found more fre-
quently in areas where malaria is endemic.
Theiler, Max (1899–1972) South African Microbiol-
ogist
Max Theiler was born on January 30, 1899, in
Pretoria, South Africa, to Sir Arnold Theiler, a well-
known veterinary scientist, and Emma Theiler (née
Jegge). He attended Rhodes University College, Gra-
hamstown, and the University of Capetown Medical
School (1916–18). He then went to England to study at
St. Thomas’s Hospital and at the London School of
Tropical Medicine, receiving a medical degree in 1922.
In 1922 he joined the department of tropical
medicine at the Harvard Medical School, Boston, Mas-
sachusetts. In 1930 he joined the staff of the Interna-
tional Health Division of the Rockefeller Foundation.
In 1951 he became director of laboratories of the
Rockefeller Foundation’s Division of Medicine and
Public Health, New York.
His early work dealt with amoebic dysentery and
rat-bite fever, but he wanted to produce a vaccine for
yellow fever, at the time a major disease in humans. By
1927 he and his colleagues had showed that the cause
of yellow fever was not a bacterium but a virus and
was easily transmitted to mice, making research on the
subject cheaper. Theiler and his colleagues produced a
vaccine, 17D, against the disease. He was awarded the
1951 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for this
breakthrough.
He contributed to two books, Viral and Rickettsial
Infections of Man (1948) and Yellow Fever (1951), and
wrote many scientific papers. He also received numer-
ous awards, including the Chalmer’s Medal of the
Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (Lon-
don, 1939). He died on August 11, 1972, in New
Haven, Connecticut.
Theorell, 
Axel 
Hugo 
Theodor (1903–1982)
Swedish Biochemist
Axel Hugo Theodor Theorell
was born in Linköping, Sweden, on July 6, 1903, to
Thure Theorell, surgeon-major to the First Life
Grenadiers practicing medicine in Linköping, and his
wife Armida Bill.
Theorell was educated at a state secondary school
in Linköping and started studying medicine in 1921 at
the Karolinska Institute. In 1924 he graduated with a
bachelor of medicine and spent three months studying
bacteriology at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. He
received an M.D. in 1930 and became lecturer in physi-
ological chemistry at the Karolinska Institute.
In 1924 he became part of the staff of the Medico-
Chemical Institution as an associate assistant and tem-
porary associate professor working on the influence of
the lipids on the sedimentation of the blood corpuscles.
In 1931 at Uppsala University, he studied the molecular
weight of myoglobin. The following year he was
appointed associate professor in medical and physio-
logical chemistry at Uppsala University, and he contin-
ued and extended his work on myoglobin.
From 1933 until 1935 he held a Rockefeller fel-
lowship and became interested in oxidation enzymes.
He produced, for the first time, the oxidation enzyme
called “the yellow ferment,” and he succeeded in split-
ting it reversibly into a coenzyme part, which was
found to be flavinmononucleotide, and a colorless
protein part.
324
tetrahydrofolate

Returning to Sweden in 1935, he worked at the
Karolinska Institute, and in 1936 he was appointed
head of the newly established biochemical department
of the Nobel Medical Institute that was opened in 1937.
He carried out research on various oxidation
enzymes, contributing to the knowledge of cytochrome-
c, peroxidases, catalases, flavoproteins, and pyridin-
proteins, particularly the alcohol dehydrogenases. For
his work on the nature and effects of oxidation
enzymes, he was awarded the 1955 Nobel Prize in
physiology or medicine.
He was a member of numerous scientific organiza-
tions and in 1954 was chief editor of the journal
Nordisk Medicin. He died on August 15, 1982.
therapeutic index
For a substance used to alleviate
disease, pain, or injury, the therapeutic index is the
ratio between toxic and therapeutic doses (the higher
the ratio, the greater the safety of the therapeutic dose).
thermolysin
A calcium- and zinc-containing neutral
protease isolated from certain bacteria.
thermolysis
An uncatalyzed bond cleavage resulting
from exposure of a compound to a raised temperature.
thermoregulation
The process of regulating body
temperature. There are various types of thermoregula-
tion. Ectothermic regulation is temperature based on an
organism’s behavior in response to the temperature of
the environment, e.g., amphibians and reptiles. Het-
erothermic regulation is maintaining a constant body
temperature but having the ability to fluctuate at other
times. The body temperature can rise without hurting
the animal, or it can drop significantly when the animal
enters a state of torpor, with body temperature drop-
ping almost to the level of the surroundings and with a
concurrent reduction in metabolic rate, heart rate, respi-
ration, and other functions. This can be in the form of
hibernation during winter or estivation during summer.
thick filament
A myosin filament and part of the
myofibril in muscles. Contains myosin molecules.
thigmomorphogenesis
The process in which a plant
reacts to a mechanical disturbance, such as forming
thicker stems in response to strong winds.
thigmotropism
The sense of touch response, such as
bending or turning of a plant when coming into con-
tact with a solid surface.
thorium-lead dating
A method to measure the age
of rocks and other materials that contain thorium and
lead through the use of the natural radioactive decay of
232Th (half-life about 4.7 billion years) as it decays to
208Pb. Because of the very long half-life, this dating
technique is usually restricted to ages greater than 10
million years.
threatened species
The classification provided to an
animal or plant likely to become endangered within the
foreseeable future throughout all or a significant por-
tion of its range.
See also ENDANGERED SPECIES.
three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity
relationship (3D-QSAR)
The analysis of the quanti-
tative relationship between the biological activity of a
set of compounds and their spatial properties using sta-
tistical methods.
threshold potential
The potential at which a neuron
will fire and then reset to its reset potential; when a
neuron receives inputs that increase its voltage from its
resting voltage and reaches its threshold voltage, it
sends out an action potential.
thylakoids
Enclosed membrane structures inside
CHLOROPLASTs and photosynthetic bacteria.
See also PHOTOSYNTHESIS.
thymus
A major component of the lymphatic system.
In the thymus, lymphoid cells undergo a process of mat-
uration and education prior to release into circulation.
thymus
325

This process allows T cells to develop self-tolerance
(distinguishing self from nonself). While developing in
the thymus gland, any T cell that reacts to the thymus’s
major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is eliminat-
ed. T cells that tolerate the MHC learn to cooperate
with cells expressing MHC molecules and are allowed
to mature and leave the thymus.
The result is that surviving T lymphocytes tolerate
the body’s cells and cooperate with them when needed.
However, some T lymphocytes lose this ability to dif-
ferentiate self from nonself, which results in the
autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythe-
matosus or multiple sclerosis.
thyroid gland
A two-lobed endocrine gland located
at the base of the neck that secretes hormones such as
triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), and calcitonin, a
hormone produced in the C cells that helps regulate
blood calcium by slowing down the amount of calcium
released from the bones; controls the rate of
metabolism. An enlarged thyroid gland is called goiter
and is treated with thyroid hormones.
thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
TSH is a hor-
mone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates the
synthesis and secretion of T4 (thyroxine) and T3 (tri-
iodothyronine) by the thyroid gland. TSH is itself stim-
ulated by another hormone, thyroid-releasing hormone
(TRH), which is released by the hypothalamus.
tick paralysis
Ticks produce a toxin that can cause
paralysis in animals, especially if the bite is near the
spine and causes ascending paralysis. It can be reversed
if the offending tick is removed. Can be fatal if not
removed.
tight junction
A cell-to-cell junction that forms a
fluid-tight seal between cells, preventing leakage or
passage of molecules from one side to the other.
Ti plasmid
Short for tumor-inducing plasmid. It is a
plasmid of Agrobacterium tumefaciens that is responsi-
ble for inducing tumors in infected plants. These plas-
mids are also used as vectors to introduce foreign DNA
into plant cells.
tissue
A grouping or layer of cells that, with their
products and intercellular material, together perform
specialized and specific functions. Examples include
connective, epithelial, glandular, muscular, nervous,
and skeletal tissue.
tobacco mosaic virus
This virus was the first recog-
nized viral disease. Caused by a tobamovirus, the
tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), it attacks the leaves of
many plants, causing a mosaiclike pattern of discol-
orations in the plant.
tonoplast (vascular membrane)
A cytoplasmic mem-
brane that surrounds the central vacuole separating the
cell sap from the cytosol.
topless tree
An operational scheme for ANALOG
design.
torpor
A physiological response resulting in a drop
in body temperature almost to that of the surrounding
environment and a large reduction in the metabolic
rate, heart rate, respiration, and other functions.
Hibernation is winter torpor and estivation is summer
torpor.
totipotency
The ability of a single cell to develop
unlike cells that will develop into a fully differentiated
organism or part.

The action of poisons (including XENOBI-
OTICs) on biochemical reactions or processes in living
organisms or ecological systems. A study of this action
is the subject matter of toxicology.

functions in very small amounts that vary for different
organisms. Included among the trace elements are Co,
Cu, F, Fe, I, Mn, Mo, Ni, Se, V, W, and Zn. Excessive
mineral intake can produce toxic symptoms.
trachea
A linear portion of the respiratory tract that
connects the larynx to the bronchial tubes, forming an
inverted Y; part of it is in the throat, and the other is in
the chest. Called the windpipe.
tracheae
Tiny tubes that branch throughout the
body cavity of insects that carry air and exchange
gases.
tracheal system
The part of the insect’s respiratory
system composed of the tracheae and tracheole (small
end tubes formed within single cells of the tracheal
epithelium); opens to the outside of the body through
spiracles.
tracheid
A thick-walled cell of the xylem tissue that
is water conducting and is thickened and hardened by
lignin; also helps in supporting the plant.
trans
In inorganic nomenclature, a structural prefix
designating two groups directly across a CENTRAL
ATOM from each other (not generally recommended for
precise nomenclature purposes of complicated systems).
See also CIS.

information encoded in a linear 
SEQUENCE
of
NUCLEOTIDES in one strand of DNA is copied into an
exactly complementary sequence of RNA.

327
Scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of the internal lining, or epithelium, of the human trachea. The numerous fine hairlike projections,
called cilia, protrude from the tops of specialized epithelial cells. Between the epithelial cells lie goblet cells, whose function is to
release mucus onto the surface of the epithelium. Rhythmic movements of the cilia serve to move bacteria and other particles caught in
the mucus away from the gas-exchanging parts of the lungs, up the trachea, and toward the throat, where they can be swallowed or
coughed up. Magnification: ×4000 at 10 × 8 inch size. (Courtesy © E. Gray/Photo Researchers, Inc.)

transcription factor
The regulatory protein that
binds to DNA and stimulates the transcription of genes.
transduction
(1) The transfer of genetic information
from one bacterium to another by means of a transduc-
ing bacteriophage. When the phage is grown on the
first host, a fragment of the host DNA can be incorpo-
rated into the phage particles. This foreign DNA can be
transferred to the second host upon infection with
progeny phage from the first experiment. (2) In cell
biology, the transduction of a signal (mechanical signal,
hormone, etc.) to cells or tissues summarizes the chain
of events between the primary reception of the signal
and the final response (change in growth and/or
METABOLISM) of the target cells or tissues. Inorganic
substances (e.g., calcium ions) are frequently involved
in the transduction of signals.
See also GENETIC CODE.
transferase
An ENZYME of EC class 2, which cat-
alyzes the transfer of a group from one SUBSTRATE to
another.
See also EC NOMENCLATURE FOR ENZYMES.
transferrin
An iron-transport protein of blood PLAS-
MA, that comprises two similar iron-binding DOMAINs
with high affinity for Fe(III). Similar proteins are found
in milk (lactoferrin) and eggs (ovotransferrin).
transfer RNA (tRNA)
RNA that translates the
nucleotide language of codons into the amino acid lan-
guage of proteins. The tRNAs bond with amino acids
and transfer them to the ribosomes, where the new pro-
teins are assembled based on the genetic code carried
by mRNA.
transformation
The assimilation of external genetic
material into a cell.
transition element
A transition element is an element
whose atom has an incomplete d-subshell, or that 
gives rise to a cation or cations with an incomplete 
d-subshell. The first transition series of elements is Sc,
Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu. The second and third
transition series are similarly derived: these include the
lanthanoids (lanthanides) and actinoids (actinides),
respectively, which are designated inner (or f) transition
elements of their respective periods in the periodic table.
transition-state analog
A compound that mimics
the transition state of a substrate bound to an ENZYME.
translation
The unidirectional process that takes
place on the RIBOSOMEs whereby the genetic informa-
tion present in an mRNA is converted into a corre-
sponding SEQUENCE of amino acids in a protein.
See also GENETIC CODE.
translocation
A
mutation that occurs and that
moves a piece of chromosome to a different chromo-
some. A balanced translocation happens when two
chromosomes break and exchange places, leaving no
net loss of genetic material. While an individual with a
balanced translocation will be unaffected, future chil-
dren may be. A Robertsonian translocation occurs
when the translocations of chromosomes involve an
end-to-end fusion with the resulting loss of the short
arms. While the carrier has 45 chromosomes and is
normal, resulting children may be affected. A reciprocal
translocation happens when single breaks in two non-
homologous chromosomes produce an exchange of
chromosome sections between them. An insertion is a
form of translocation where an interstitial segment
from one chromosome that resulted from two breaks is
inserted within a nonhomologous chromosome at a
third break point.
Translocation is also the term used for the trans-
port of food by way of the phloem.
transpiration
The loss of water from a plant or tree
by way of the stomata.
transposon (transposable element)
A mobile piece
of DNA that can move and be inserted into a new loca-
tion (transposition). Formerly called jumping genes.
328

reaction intermediate so that it is removed from the
system or converted into a more STABLE form for study
or identification.
tree
A perennial plant that grows from the ground
up, usually with a single, mostly tall, woody, self-
supporting trunk or stem with bark, and an associated
elevated crown of branches and foliage. May shed
leaves or keep needles yearly.
trench fever
A
bacterial infection that causes
repeated cycles of high fever. Common in World War
I and II, due to bacteria that was passed among 
soldiers through contact with body lice, overcrowd-
ing, and bad hygiene conditions among soldiers in
trenches. Two different bacteria can cause trench
fever: Bartonella quintana and Bartonella henselae.
B. quintana is carried by body lice; B. henselae is
carried by ticks.

unprepared or improperly cooked meats, particularly
pork products.
trichocyst
A structure in the outer cytoplasm of cili-
ates and dinoflaggelates that produces hairlike or dart-
like fibers that can be discharged for defensive/
offensive purposes in organisms, e.g., paramecium.
trilobite
Ancient class (Trilobita) of hard-shelled,
segmented creatures with jointed legs; one of the first
arthropods, they existed over 300 million years ago in
the Earth’s ancient seas. There are nine orders, more
than 150 families, 5,000 genera, and over 15,000
described species. Mostly detritivores, predators, or
scavengers, the trilobites were one of the most diverse
groups ever known.
triplet code
A code in which a given amino acid is
specified by a set of three nucleotides (codons).
See also CODON.
triploblastic
Organisms formed with three cell lay-
ers, the endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm.
triploidy
A rare chromosomal abnormality where
three complete sets of the haploid genome exist instead
of the normal two sets. In humans there are 69 
chromosomes instead of the normal 46 chromosomes.
Usually results in miscarriage or death in the first few
hours or days after birth.

troop
A group of lemurs, monkeys, apes, or other
primates.
trophallaxis
The mutual exchange of alimentary liq-
uid among colony members, such as between adult and
larvae of certain social insects, e.g., ants, bees, or
wasps.
trophic level
Serves as a way to delineate levels on
the food chain from producers to consumers. Some
organisms like humans are multitrophic.
trophic structure
The distribution of the energy
flow and its relationships through the various trophic
levels.
trophoblast
The outer layer of epithelium of the
blastocyst that gives rise to the mammalian placenta
and in which the embryo receives nourishment from
the mother. The trophoblast differentiates into the syn-
cytiotrophoblasts, the outer large cell layer that pro-
duces HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) that
stimulates the production of estrogen and progesterone
within the ovary, and cytotrophoblast, the compacted
cell inner layer next to the mesoderm. The trophoblast
attaches itself to the uterus wall in a process called
implantation and goes on to become the various life
support systems (placenta, amniotic sac, umbilical
cord), while the blastocyst develops into the embryo.
tropical rain forest
A warm, moist terrestrial biome
with a tree canopy. Two types of rain forest exist, the
temperate and the tropical. Tropical rain forests are
found close to the equator, while temperate rain forests
are found near coastal areas, such as the American
Pacific Northwest stretching from Oregon to Alaska for
1,200 miles. Characteristics of rain forests are trees that
flare at the base, with very dense vegetation that is tall
and green and rich in animal species. Both types receive
lots of rain, with the tropical rain forest obtaining 400
inches a year, while the temperate rain forest receives
about 100 inches per year. Tropical rain forests are
warm and moist, but temperate rain forests are cool.
Tropical rain forests lie between the tropic of Cancer
and the tropic of Capricorn and receive rainfall regularly
throughout the year (80–400 inches per year) and are
warm and frost free all year long (mean temperatures
are between 70 and 85°F), with very little daily fluctua-
tion. Tropical rain forests are found in Latin America
(57 percent), while one-third of the world’s tropical rain
forests are in Brazil. Some 25 percent of the tropical rain
forests can be found in Southeast Asia and the Pacific
Islands, and 18 percent are found in West Africa.
Smaller temperate rain forests can be found on the
southeast coast of Chile in South America and a few
other coastal strips, including small areas in the United
Kingdom, Norway, Japan, New Zealand, and southern
Australia.
Half of the world’s plant and animal species live in
the tropical rain forests, even though they comprise
only 20 percent of all forests. These richly diverse
ecosystems are being destroyed at a rate of 30 acres of
trees being cut every minute.
tropic hormone
Hormones that cause secretion of
other hormones.
tropism
The movement of a plant toward (positive
tropism) or away (negative tropism) from an environ-
mental stimulus by elongating cells at different rates.
Phototropism is induced by light; gravitropism is
induced by gravitational pull; hydrotropism is a
response to water gradients; and thigmotropism is a
response to touch.
tsetse flies
Vectors of African trypanosomiasis, caus-
ing nagana in livestock, a fatal disease of horses and
cattle, and sleeping sickness in humans. Members of the
Glossinidae; there are 23 species and eight subspecies.
The simple proboscis of tsetse flies projects straight out
front from the head, consisting only of labrum,
hypopharynx, and labium. Found only in sub-Saharan
Africa and two localities in the Arabian Peninsula.
tuber
A short, swelled or enlarged, fleshy under-
ground part of a stem or root used as food storage by
the plant, e.g., potato.

tuberculosis (TB)
A contagious bacterial infection
caused by bacteria that are members of the Mycobac-
terium genus, usually by Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
that usually affects the lungs or other body organs. Can
be spread by person-to-person contact through watery
airborne droplets of coughs and in the mucus that
infected persons cough up from their throats. Some 10
to 20 million Americans have been infected, and one-
third of the world’s population. Can be treated with
medicines, and a vaccine is available.
tularemia
An infectious disease with high fever and
other complications caused by the bacterium Pasteurel-
la tularensis, which affects mostly people who handle
infected wild rabbits, although it can be transmitted by
ticks, contaminated food, water, and other animals.
Mortality rate is about 6 percent.
tumor
(neoplasm)
A mass of abnormal tissue that
arises from normal tissue; grows abnormally in rate
and structure and serves no physiological function;
abnormal regulation of cell growth.
Tumors can be benign, characterized by being
slow-growing and harmless, depending on the location;
malignant, characterized by being fast-growing, likely
to spread, and capable of damaging other organs or
systems; or intermediate, which is a mixture of benign
and malignant cells.
Tumors can be caused by abnormalities of the
immune system, radiation, genetic mutations, viruses,
sunlight, tobacco, benzene and other mutagens, poi-
sonous mushrooms, and aflatoxins.
Also called neoplasm, the preferred medical term.
tumor suppressor gene
A normal gene whose pur-
pose is to suppress cell growth or proliferation (can-
cer). However, if a mutation, inactivation, or deletion
of part or all of one allele of a tumor suppressor gene
occurs, it predisposes the individual to increased risk of
tumor or cancer development.
tundra
An area of flat or undulating treeless barrens
found across the northern parts of Asia, Europe, and
North America, covering over one-fifth of the earth’s
surface. Covered with lichens, sedges and grasses,
mosses, and low shrubs (dwarf willows and birches), it
is characteristic of the Arctic and alpine (high-altitude)
regions. Below the tundra soil is permafrost, a perma-
nently frozen layer of ground. During brief summers,
the top section of the soil thaws long enough for plants
and microorganisms to grow and reproduce. Animals
found in the tundra include the Arctic fox, caribou,
golden eagle, gray wolf, musk ox, Norway lemming,
polar bear, red phalarope, ruddy turnstone, and Eski-
mos and their sled dogs. The average annual tempera-
ture is only 10 to 20°F (–12°C to –6°C), with
temperatures sometimes dipping below –60°F (–51°C)
and the annual precipitation usually less than 10 inches
(25 centimeters).
turgid
Swollen, rigid, or firm. Cells become turgid
upon entry of water.
turgor pressure
Like air pressure in a car tire, it is
the outward pressure that is exerted against the inside
surface of a plant cell wall under the conditions of
water flowing into the cell by osmosis, and the result-
ing resistance by the cell wall to further expansion.
turtles
A group of slow-moving armored reptiles
(subclass Anapsida, order Testudines) with 11 families
that include terrestrial, amphibious, freshwater, and
marine species. They are oviparous, cold-blooded, have
scaly skin, and lay eggs. A turtle’s armor is the back-
bone fused to the shell, and the central disk of the
upper shell, or carapace, is formed by a fusion of bony
plates with the turtle’s ribs. Their ribs lie outside the
shoulder and pelvic bones, which allows them to
retract their limbs and heads into the shells. They live
worldwide except for Antarctica. Turtles are the oldest
living group of reptiles, first appearing about 200 mil-
lion years ago. Many of the terrestrial turtles are called
tortoises. Many species today are endangered because
of habitat destruction.
twins
A pair of offspring that go through the same
gestation period at the same time from the same 
mother. Two forms exist. Identical twins develop from
twins
331

a single fertilized egg that splits in two and creates 
two genetic replicas, while fraternal twins develop from
separate eggs and sperm.
tympanic membrane  (ear drum)
A stretched, thin,
semitransparent membrane attached to the ossicles of
the middle ear and located at the end of the auditory
canal. Sounds in the canal cause the tympanic mem-
brane to vibrate. It is attached to the malleus (hammer)
and its vibrations move the malleus, which in turn
moves the incus (anvil).
type 1,2,3 copper
Different classes of copper-
BINDING SITEs in proteins, classified by their spectro-
scopic properties as Cu(II). In type 1, or BLUE COPPER
centers, the copper is coordinated to at least two imi-
dazole nitrogens from histidine and one sulfur from
cysteine. They are characterized by small copper
HYPERFINE couplings and a strong visible absorption
in the Cu(II) state. In type 2, or non-blue copper
sites, the copper is mainly bound to imidazole nitro-
gens from histidine. Type 3 copper centers comprise
two spin-coupled copper ions bound to imidazole
nitrogens.
See also COORDINATION.
type species
Refers to a species that was selected as
the representative of a genus.
type specimen
The actual specimen from which a
new species is named. If the original author does not
designate an individual, a single specimen from the
original series can be selected as the lectotype.
typhus
An
infectious disease transmitted by the
microorganism of genus Rickettisia (e.g., Rickettsia
prowazekii) by lice, mites, ticks, and fleas. Also called
typhus fever. Fatality is as high as 60 percent if not
treated.
tyrosinase
A copper protein containing an antiferro-
magnetically coupled dinuclear copper unit (TYPE 3-like
site) that oxygenates the tyrosine group to catechol and
further oxidizes this to the quinone.
See also FERROMAGNETIC; NUCLEARITY.
tyrosine kinase (PTKs)
Protein enzymes that modu-
late a wide variety of cellular events, including differen-
tiation, growth, metabolism, and apoptosis. Protein
kinases add phosphate groups to proteins. Enzymes
that add phosphate groups to tyrosine residues are
called protein tyrosine kinases. These enzymes have
important roles in signal transduction and regulation of
cell growth, and their activity is regulated by a set of
molecules called protein tyrosine phosphatases that
remove the phosphate from the tyrosine residues. A
tyrosine kinase is an enzyme that specifically phospho-
rylates (attach phosphate groups to) tyrosine residues
in proteins and are critical in T- and B-cell activation.
tyrosine kinase receptor
Proteins found in the plas-
ma membrane of the cell that can phosphorylate
(attach phosphate groups to) on a tyrosine residue in a
protein. Insulin is an example of a hormone whose
receptor is a tyrosine kinase. Following binding of the
hormone, the receptor undergoes a conformational
change, phosphorylates itself, then phosphorylates a
variety of intracellular targets.

ubiquitous
Existing or having presence everywhere
at the same time. For example, ribonuclease, an enzyme
that degrades RNA, is ubiquitous in living organisms.

ior has evolved and its context within the environment.
Identifies the evolutionary factors responsible for the
behavior and its purpose within a biological system.
ultrasound
The use of sound with a frequency high-
er than 20,000 Hz. Used to obtain images for medical
diagnostic purposes, especially during pregnancy.
umwelt
The total sensory and perceptual world of
an animal.
uniformitarianism
A doctrine that states that current
geological and biological processes, occurring at the same
rates and in the same manner observed today, account
for all of Earth’s geological and biological features. “The
present is the key to the past.” The doctrine of uniformi-
tarianism was advanced by James Hutton (1726–97) in
his publication, Theory of the Earth (1785).
unsaturated fatty acids
Fatty acids are the essential
building blocks of all fats in our food supply and body,
but not all of them have beneficial results. There are
five major fatty acids types: saturated (SAFA), unsatu-
rated (UFA), monounsaturated (MUFA), polyunsatu-
rated (PUFA), and essential (EFA).
An unsaturated fatty acid is a long-chain car-
boxylic acid that contains one or more carbon 
C=C double bonds. They occur when all of the 
carbons in a chemical chain are not saturated with
hydrogen, so that the fat molecule contains one or
more double bonds and produces a fat that is fluid at
room temperature.
There are three types of unsaturated fatty acids:
monounsaturates such as oleic acid found in olive and
sesame oils that contain one double bond; polyunsatu-
rated fats such as corn, soybean, and sunflower oils
that contain more than one double bond; and essential
fatty acids (EFA) that, while they cannot be created in
the body, are important. EFAs include linoleic acid
(LA) and alpha-linolenic acid (LNA).
The double bonds in a molecule of an unsaturated
fatty acid can be found in two forms known as cis and
trans.
Cis double bonds produce a kink, or a bend of
about 30 degrees for each double bond into the back-
bone and can flip over to the trans form under high
temperatures. Trans double bonds allow the molecule
to lie in a straight line. However, the human body can-
not convert the trans form into nutrients and thus can-
not activate the metabolic activities required to convert
to the active cis forms. This can lead to a deficiency in
essential fatty acids. The more double bonds, and
333
U

therefore the more kinks, the more beneficial it is to
human health. The kinks, by completely changing the
physical and chemical properties, allow it to form
essential protein associations more easily, disperse
more saturated fatty acids, and interact with water or
blood.
See also SATURATED FATTY ACID.
urea
A nitrogen-containing waste product; a result of
the normal breakdown of protein in the liver in mam-
mals. It is created in liver cells from ammonia and car-
bon dioxide, and carried via the bloodstream to the
kidneys, where it is excreted in the urine along with
nitrogen. Urea accumulates in the body of people with
renal failure. Urea is also a synthetic source of nitrogen
made from natural gas.
urease
A nickel ENZYME, urea amidohydrolase, that
catalyzes the HYDROLYSIS of urea to ammonia and car-
bon dioxide. The ACTIVE SITE comprises two Ni(II) ions
bridged by a carbamate.
ureter
Tubes, about eight to 12 inches in length, that
run from the kidney to the bladder on each side and
carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.
urethra
A narrow tube or canal that carries urine
from the bladder, and semen from the prostrate and
other sex glands, out via the tip of the penis to the out-
side of the body.
uric acid
The end results of urine breakdown, a
product of protein metabolism, which is the major
form of excreting metabolic nitrogen out of the body.
Too much uric acid in the blood and its salts in joints
lead to gout, which causes pain and swelling in the
joints. When urine contains too much uric acid, “kid-
ney” or uric acid stones can develop.
urochordate
A chordate (organism having a noto-
chord at some stage of development) without a back-
bone, also called a tunicate or sea squirt; a sessile
marine animal composed of a sack with two siphons in
which water enters and exits, filtered inside by the
sack-shaped body.
urticating
The act of causing itching or burning sen-
sation to the skin or eyes as a result of being inflicted
by the entry of poison-filled spines (tips often break
off) or setae that contain venom capable of causing
pain and irritation. Found on the abdomen of tarantu-
las, some caterpillars, and the Urticaceae, plants of the
nettle family.
334
urea
Colored scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of crystals of calci-
um carbonate on the surface of an otolith, found in the utricle. An
otolith or otoconium is a calcified stone that is found in the otolith
organs of the inner ear. They are attached to sensory hairs, and,
when the head tilts, the stones’ movements cause nerve impulses
that allow a sense of balance and orientation to be maintained. In
humans, otoconia range from 3 to 30 microns (millionths of a
meter) across. Magnification unknown. (Courtesy © Susumu

uterus
A pear-shaped hollow female reproductive
organ in the pelvis area, at the top of the vagina, where
eggs are fertilized and/or development of the young
occurs.
utricle
The larger of two membranous sacs (the other
is the saccule) within the vestibule, the cavity at the
entrance to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear. The
utricle contains receptors for balance and a macula that
is responsive to linear acceleration. The macula is a
group of hair cells residing in either the saccule or the
utricle and covered with gelatinous material containing
otoliths, which are small granules of calcium carbon-
ate. The ear’s semicircular canals lead to and from the
utricle.

vaccination
Injection of a killed or weakened infec-
tious organism (virus, bacterium) in order to prevent
the disease. Vaccinations are administered via needles,
orally, or by aerosol spray.
vaccine
A preparation that stimulates an immune
response in the body that can prevent an infection or
create resistance to an infection or disease. Vaccines are
administered via needles, orally, or by aerosol spray.
There are several types of vaccines, ranging from
monovalent types that contain only one antigen to
combinational vaccines where several antigens are com-
bined into one. Vaccines can be live or attenuated, i.e.,
a weakened strain, to induce the immune response
while bypassing the severe effects of the disease. Com-
mon vaccines include measles, mumps, polio, and oth-
ers. A live-vector vaccine uses a nondisease virus or
bacterium to deliver a foreign substance to develop
immunity. An inactive vaccine contains dead viruses or
bacteria and cannot cause disease but will trigger a
response.
There are acellular vaccines that contain only a
partial amount of cellular material; DNA vaccines
that inject genes with coding for a specific antigen
protein; bacterial vaccines that use bacteria; intracel-
lular vaccines within a cell; and conjugate vaccines
that are made with polysaccharide (carbohydrate)
antigens bound to proteins to improve the effect of
immunity.
vacuole
A large membrane-bound, fluid-filled space
within a cell. In plant cells, there usually is a single
large vacuole filling most of the cell’s volume, which
helps maintain the shape of the cells. Vacuoles can con-
tain food, gas, ingested bacteria, and other debris. In
species such as the paramecium, two vacuoles are
important: the contractile vacuole is used in osmoregu-
lation, which is the removal of excess water; the food
vacuole contains recently ingested food, where it even-
tually combines or fuses with the cell’s lysosomes,
which contain enzymes for digestion.
vagility
Free to move about, ability to move or
migrate. A vagile species is one whose distribution can
vary widely from year to year.
valence shell
Valence electrons are the electrons
located in the outermost, highest energy orbits or
“shell” of an atom. The “shell” is more of a field 
density and indicates the region where the electrons are
located. The valence electrons determine the chemical
properties of an element, since it is these valence elec-
trons that are gained or lost during a chemical reaction.
van der Waals forces
Weak forces, such as seen in
hydrogen bonding, that contribute to intermolecular
bonding.

vascular cambium
A secondary meristem, i.e., a
thin layer of undifferentiated plant cells that divide
indefinitely, which gives rise to secondary xylem and
phloem, leading to an increase in stem girth. Tissue
external to the vascular cambium is bark.
vascular plants
The plant kingdom comprises
algae, bryophytes, seedless vascular plants, and seed
vascular plants (gymnosperms and angiosperms). Most
of the familiar flora in the United States such as trees,
shrubs, herbs, vines, grasses, ferns, and most other
land plants belong to the Tracheophyta, or vascular
plants.
These plants have systems for transporting water,
sugars, and nutrients and are differentiated into stems,
leaves, and roots. They have an elaborate system of
conducting cells, consisting of xylem, where water and
minerals are transported, and phloem, where carbohy-
drates are transported. This method of rigid internal
support enables them to stand and grow erect and dis-
tribute nutrients against gravity.
There are about 17,000 species of vascular plants
native to the United States, along with several thousand
additional native subspecies, varieties, named natural
hybrids, and about 5,000 exotic species known outside
cultivation. More than 4,850 species (about 28 per-
cent) of the native U.S. vascular plants are considered
globally rare.
Vascular plants first appear in the fossil record dur-
ing the mid-Silurian period, about 410 million years
ago. Rhyniophyta is the earliest known division of
these plants, represented by several genera. Vascular is
from Latin vasculum, meaning a vessel or duct.
Nonvascular plants, like mosses and liverworts,
have poorly developed fluid transportation systems.
vascular system
A network of specialized cells; the
vascular tissue that transports water and nutrients from
the roots throughout a plant’s body. In animals, it is a
specialized network of vessels—arteries, veins, and cap-
illaries—for the circulation of fluids throughout the
body tissue of an animal.
vascular tissue
The collective name given to the
xylem and phloem, both tissues that carry food, water,
and minerals through the plant for the nourishment of
the cells in vascular plants.
vas deferens (sperm duct)

vector
A vector can be a bacterium or virus that does
not cause disease in humans. It is often used in geneti-
cally engineered vaccines to transport antigen-encoding
genes into the body to initiate an immune response.
Additionally, a vector can be an organism, usually an
insect, that transmits an infectious agent to its alternate
host. Examples are malaria, where the vector of the
parasite is mosquitoes, and the hosts are humans.
vegetative reproduction
Asexual reproduction in
plants from vegetative parts (stems, leaves, or roots) or
from modified stems (bulbs, tubers, rhizomes, and
stolons). There is no exchange of gametes, and unless
mutations occur, each new generation of plants is
genetically identical to the parent plant.
vein
A thin-walled blood vessel that carries blood to
the heart. Smaller veins called venules connect veins to
capillaries.
In plants, they are the vascular bundles in leaves that
consist of xylem and phloem. The veins are large along
the leaf midvein and petiole and get smaller as they radi-
ate out into the leaf, becoming known as veinlets.
See also ARTERY.
ventilation
Ventilation is the passage of air into and
out of the respiratory tract. Ventilation exchange (VE)
is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide and
other gases during the passage of air into and out of
the respiratory passages.
ventricle
The chamber of the heart that receives blood
from the atrium (chamber that collects blood returning
from the rest of the body) and contracts and pumps
blood away from the heart. There are two ventricles in
mammals and birds. The right ventricle pumps deoxy-
genated blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery; the
left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood to the body via the
aorta. The tricuspid valve separates the right atrium and
the right ventricle and prevents backflow from the ventri-
cle to the atrium. The mitral valve separates the left atri-
um and the left ventricle and prevents backflow from the
ventricle to the atrium. The aortic valve prevents back-
flow of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle.
There are four brain ventricles. The right and left
lateral ventricles lie within the cerebral cortex and con-
nect with the very narrow third ventricle by way of
openings called interventricular foramina. This third
ventricle lies between the two halves of the thalamus
and connects to the fourth ventricle via a long, thin
tube called the cerebral aqueduct. The fourth ventricle
lies in the hindbrain, under the cerebellum and dorsal
to the pons and medulla.
vernalization
A required chilling period leading to
the breaking of dormancy in plants. Flowering can be
accelerated or induced by exposure to a long period of
near-freezing temperatures.
vertebra
One of the segments of bone or cartilage
composing the spinal column of vertebrates. In the
spinal column of adult humans, there are 33 vertebrae:
seven cervical vertebrae in the neck, 12 thoracic verte-
brae that support the ribs, five lumbar vertebrae in the
lower back, and other fused vertebrae forming the
sacrum and the coccyx, beneath the sacrum.
vertebral bodies
The oval segments of bone on the
spine that support most of the axial load of the spine
and consist mostly of the thoracic and lumbar verte-
brae. The lumbar part of the spine—consisting of five
lumbar vertebral bodies that sit on top of the sacrum—
is above the coccyx, the tailbone. The lumbar spine
supports most of the weight of the body, and its verte-
bral bodies are larger than the rest. The thoracic part
of the spine consists of 12 bodies. The thoracic region
supports the cervical spine (neck), which has seven
bodies and supports the head.
vertebrates
Chordate animals that have a spinal col-
umn or backbone (with the exception of hagfish and
the rudimentary form of lampreys). The category
vertebrates
339

includes fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mam-
mals; a member of the phylum Chordata.
Three subphyla exist: Urochordata (sea squirts, lar-
vaceans), Cephalochordata (amphioxus, lancelets), and
Craniata (hagfish plus all the vertebrates). Another
smaller phylum Hemichordates, the sawblades and
acorns, are important in the study of vertebrate evolu-
tion. Although they contain only a few hundred
species, they seem to share some of the chordate char-
acteristics: brachial openings, or “gill slits,” into the
pharynx; a rudimentary structure called the stomo-
chord that is similar to a notochord; and a dorsal nerve
cord and a smaller ventral nerve cord. However, DNA
studies are showing that hemichordates may be closer
to echinoderms.
There are approximately 50,000 living species of
vertebrates, with slightly fewer total fish vertebrates
(25,988), the oldest group, than all others combined
(4,500 mammals, 9,100 birds, 7,082 reptiles, 4,880
amphibians). They range in size from 0.1 gram to
100,000 kilograms. The Cephalochordata have the
fewest number of living species with 45, followed by
the Urochordata with 2,000 species, and the Craniata
with 43,000 species.
Vertebrates are chordates with a distinct head and
contain sense organs and a brain. Other characteristics
include a segmented vertebral rod of cartilage/bone, a
closed circulatory system, true coelom, and a bilaterally
symmetrical body.
Vertebrates first appeared on Earth some 500 mil-
lion years ago when continents were fragmented. Then
the continents combined into the supercontinent Pan-
gaea, which included most of the Earth’s crust, some
300 million years ago, fragmenting again 100 million
years ago into Laurasia (the northern continents) and
Gondwanaland (the southern continents). Vertebrates
live in almost every conceivable habitat on earth.

vesicle
A small, membrane-enclosed sac, cyst, or bub-
ble found in the cytosol, the semifluid inside the cell
membrane of eukaryotic cells. Vesicles are used to trans-
port proteins and lipids to various destinations in the
cell, including the sites of glycolysis (the first stage of
energy production by the cell), and fatty acid synthesis.
Vesicles can import particles in a process called endocy-
tosis or export waste in a process called exocytosis.
In botanical terms, a vesicle is a small bladderlike
body in the substance of a vegetable or on the surface
of a leaf. In medical terms, a vesicle is a small and
more-or-less circular elevation of the cuticle, skin
340
vesicle
View of the spine and pelvis of a human skeleton. The spine is a
column of 33 roughly cylindrical bones called vertebrae. Between
each vertebra is a disc-shaped pad of cartilage. At the top of the
image, seven cervical vertebrae support the skull. The 12 thoracic
vertebrae are below this, and each of these supports an attached
rib (not seen). The lumbar spine is five vertebrae that support the
lower back, and these take most of the strain when lifting. At the
bottom, the sacrum consists of 5 fused vertebrae that connect to
the pelvic bone. The pelvic bone protects and supports abdominal
organs. (Courtesy © James Stevenson/Photo Researchers, Inc.)

lesion, or blister containing a clear watery fluid; a cavi-
ty or sac, especially one filled with fluid. Anatomy
refers to the umbilical vesicle, while zoology defines a
vesicle as a small, convex, hollow prominence on the
surface of a shell or a coral. In geological terms, a vesi-
cle is a small cavity, nearly spherical in form and the
size of a pea or smaller, common in some volcanic
rocks and produced by the liberation of watery vapor
in the molten mass.
vessel element
Individual, short, wide, or fat cells
arranged end to end, forming a system of tubes in the
xylem. The cell walls are pitted and contain lignin,
which gives them strength. They function to carry
water and minerals upward in the stem and root.
vestigial organ
Nonfunctional remains of organs
that were previously functional and served a purpose in
ancestral species, that no longer serve that purpose, but
that remain part of the body and may still be function-
al in related species; e.g., the dewclaws of dogs, tails in
human embryos, wisdom teeth in adults, wings of the
ostrich, rudimentary legs in snakes, and whales with
hip bones.
vetch (Vicia sativa)
An annual forage legume, 40 to
80 cm in height. Chiefly pollinated by bees because it
produces much nectar. Also, the maximum surface of a
lake exposed to prevailing winds.
vicariance
The separation of a group of organisms
caused by a geographic barrier (e.g., mountain, lake,
sea, etc.), resulting in the original group differentiating
into new varieties or species.
viremia
The presence of virus in the bloodstream.
Often associated with malaise, fever, and aching in the
back and extremities.
viroid (satellite RNA)
Once thought to be a virus, a
viroid is an infectious, pathogenic entity similar to a
virus but having only one strand of nucleic acid without
the protein coat that defines a virus; a naked unencap-
sulated strand of RNA. Viroids are known to cause
plant diseases. For example, potato spindle tuber viroid
(PSTV) can cause a destructive disease of potatoes.
virus
A small microorganism that contains RNA or
DNA and is surrounded by a protein coat. Viruses
infect cells and then replicate new viruses after invasion
using the protein of the infected cells to reproduce.
Viruses can cause many human diseases, including
chicken pox, measles, mumps, rubella, pertussis, and
hepatitis, and they are not affected by common drugs
such as antibiotics, which are effective against bacteria-
based disease. Instead, vaccines are used to prevent or
fight off virus attacks.
See also BACTERIA.
visceral (visceral muscle)
Pertaining to the internal
organs of the body, especially those within the abdomi-
nal cavity such as the digestive tract, bladder, and the
heart; smooth muscle, as opposed to the two other
muscle types, skeletal and cardiac.
visible light
The portion of the electromagnetic spec-
trum that humans perceive. This excludes radio waves,
microwaves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, X rays,
and gamma rays. The human eye perceives the visible-
light spectrum as a continuum of colors (red, orange,
yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet, along with vari-
ous combinations and shades of these colors), with the
perceived color depending on the wavelength. The
spectrum of visible light ranges in wavelength from
about 400 nm to about 700 nm. Visible light travels at
the same speed as all other radiation, i.e., at 186,000
miles per second, and its wavelength is longer than
ultraviolet light but shorter than X rays. Violet has the
shortest wavelength, while red has the longest.
See also ENERGY.
vitalism
Attributed to the teachings of Aristotle, the
concept of vitalism, in its many forms, is the belief that
life forms and natural phenomena cannot be explained
by simple explanations of matter and processes. Vital-
ism posits that there must be another force, perhaps a
vitalism
341

soul or spirit, that must be added to the equation that
brings us life as we know it. This was one of the central
interests of scientists and scholars during the latter part
of the 19th century, and many spent time investigating
the relationship between human beings and nature by
studying the physiology of perception, as opposed to
the mechanistic theory that all living organisms are
inanimate and mechanical. Most of the biologists of
that era believed in the existence of a life force of some
kind. It was opposed in the 19th century by meteorolo-
gist/scientist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821–94), who
spent many years trying to prove it wrong.
vitamin
An essential organic nutrient that is needed
in small amounts by an organism for metabolism and
other processes. Organisms either synthesize them or
obtain them in other ways. Examples of vitamins are
vitamin C and vitamin E, both antioxidants. A vita-
min usually functions as a coenzyme or a component
of a coenzyme and is soluble in either water or organ-
ic solvent. The lack of certain vitamins can lead to
disease such as in rickets (vitamin D), tooth decay
(vitamin K), bone softening (vitamin D), or night
blindness (vitamin A). Other vitamins include vitamin
B1 (thiamin), vitamin B2 (riboflavin), niacinamide

B12 (cobalamin), pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), pyri-
doxal (vitamin B6), phylloquinone (vitamin K), biotin,
folic acid, inositol, choline, and PABA (para amino
benzoic acid). Vitamin supplements are a billion dol-
lar per year industry.

vitiligo
A skin condition of unpigmented spots deter-
mined by a dominant gene that destroys special skin
cells (melanocytes). These skin cells produce the pig-
ment melanin in the skin along with tissues (mucus
membranes) that line the inside of the mouth, nose, gen-
ital and rectal areas, and the retina of the eyes. About
40 to 50 million people worldwide have vitiligo, and in
the United States alone, 2 to 5 million people have it.
viviparous
Animals that are viviparous are born live
after being nourished by blood from the placenta while
in the uterus, and do not hatch from eggs.
voltage-gated channel
Ion channels are pores in
cell membranes that allow the passage of ions in and
out of cells. There are two types, voltage-gated and
chemically gated channels. The opening and closing of
the voltage-dependent ion channels is regulated by
voltage, the electrical charge or potential difference
between the inside and outside of the membrane,
while chemical stimuli are responsible for opening and
closing the chemically gated channels. Neurons use
these channels to pass sodium and potassium ions
through them.

Wagner-Jauregg, Julius (1857–1940) Austrian Neu-
rologist, Psychiatrist
Julius Wagner was born on
March 7, 1857, in Wels, Austria, to Adolf Johann Wag-
ner. He attended the Schotten gymnasium in Vienna
and in 1880 received his medical degree at the Institute
of General and Experimental Pathology, where he
stayed for two years.
In 1889 he was appointed extraordinary professor
at the medical faculty of the University of Graz. Here
he started his investigations on the connections
between goiter and cretinism, and, based on his
research, the government started selling salt laced with
iodine in the areas most affected by goiter. From 1893
to 1928 he was professor at the University of Vienna.
Wagner’s life work was to cure mental disease by
inducing a fever, after observing that mental patients
improve after surviving certain infections that have
high fevers. In 1917, using malaria inoculation, he was
able to cure syphilis patients of dementia paralytica, or
paresis, caused by syphilis, bringing the disease under
control. He attributed the success of the procedure to
the induced malarial fever, and this discovery earned
him the Nobel Prize in 1927. This is considered the
first example of “shock therapy.”
His main publication was a book titled Verhütung
und Behandlung der progressiven Paralyse durch Impf-
malaria (Prevention and treatment of progressive paral-
ysis by malaria inoculation) in the memorial volume of
the Handbuch der experimentellen Therapie (Hand-
book of experimental therapy) (1931). His other works
include Myxödem und Kretinismus in the Handbuch
der Psychiatrie (1912) and Lehrbuch der Organothera-
pie (Textbook of organotherapy) with G. Bayer (1914).
He published more than 80 papers after he retired in
1928.
Later in life, he devoted himself to research in
forensic medicine and the legal aspects of insanity, and
he assisted in formulating the law regarding certifica-
tion of the insane in Austria. He died on September 27,
1940.
Waksman, Selman Abraham (1888–1973) Ameri-
can Biochemist
Selman Abraham Waksman was born
in Priluka, near Kiev, Russia, on July 22, 1888, to
Jacob Waksman and Fradia London. He received his
early education from private tutors and school training
in Odessa in an evening school, also with private
tutors.
In 1911 he entered Rutgers College, having won a
state scholarship the previous spring, and received a
B.S. in agriculture in 1915. He was appointed research
assistant in soil bacteriology at the New Jersey Agricul-
tural Experiment Station, and continued graduate work
at Rutgers, obtaining an M.S. in 1916, the year he
became a naturalized U.S. citizen. In 1918 he was
appointed a research fellow at the University of Cali-
fornia, where he received his Ph.D. in biochemistry the
same year.
He was invited back to Rutgers, and by 1930 was a
professor. When the Department of Microbiology was
organized in 1940, he became professor of microbiology
345
W

and head of the department, and nine years later he
was appointed director of the Institute of Microbiology.
He retired in 1958.
Waksman brought medicine from the soil. By
studying soil-based acintomycetes, he was able to
extract a number of antibiotics such as actinomycin
(1940), clavacin, streptothricin (1942), streptomycin
(1943), grisein (1946), neomycin (1948), fradicin, can-
dicidin, candidin, and more. His discovery of strepto-
mycin, which was the first effective treatment against
tuberculosis, brought him the 1952 Nobel Prize in
physiology or medicine.
He published more than 400 scientific papers and
has written, alone or with others, 18 books, including
Principles of Soil Microbiology (1927) and My Life
with the Microbes (1954), an autobiography. He was a
member of numerous scientific organizations. In 1950
he was made commander of the French Légion d’Hon-
neur, and in 1952 was voted as one of the most out-
standing 100 people in the world today. He died on
August 16, 1973, in Hyannis, Massachusetts.
Wallace’s line
An imaginary line drawn by A. R.
Wallace that passes between the Philippines and the
Moluccas in the north and between Sulawesi and Bor-
neo and between Lombok and Bali in the south (the
Mariana Trench). It separates the Oriental and Aus-
tralian biogeographical regions. It marks the limits of
distribution for many major animal groups that appear
on one side of the line but are absent on the other side.
Warburg, Otto Heinrich (1883–1970) German Bio-
chemist
Otto Heinrich Warburg was born on October
8, 1883, in Freiburg, Baden, to physicist Emil Warburg.
He studied chemistry under Emil Fischer and received
his doctor of chemistry from the University of Berlin in
1906, and a doctor of medicine from the University of
Heidelberg in 1911.
In 1918 he was appointed professor at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute for Biology, Berlin-Dahlem, and from
1931 to 1953 he was director of the Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute for Cell Physiology (now Max Planck Insti-
tute) in Berlin.
He specialized in the investigation of metabolism in
tumors and respiration of cells. He discovered that
flavins and the nicotinamide were the active groups of
the hydrogen-transferring enzymes, and early discovery
of iron–oxygenase provided details of oxidation and
reduction (redux reactions) in the living organisms. For
his discovery of the nature and mode of action of the
respiratory enzymes that enable cells to process oxy-
gen, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1931. He was
offered a second Nobel Prize in 1944 for his enzyme
work, but he was not allowed to accept it, since he was
living under the Hitler regime. He later discovered how
the conversion of light energy to chemical energy is
activated in photosynthesis. During the 1930s he
showed the carcinogenic nature of food additives and
cigarette smoke and demonstrated how cancer cells are
destroyed by radiation.
Warburg is the author of New Methods of Cell
Physiology (1962). He died on August 1, 1970.
warm-blooded
Refers to organisms that main-
tain a constant body temperature. Also known as
HOMEOTHERMIC.
water potential
Direction of water flow based on
solute concentration and pressure. An example is
osmosis, which is the diffusion of water across a
semipermeable barrier, such as a cell membrane, from
high water potential to lower water potential.
Also a measure of the moisture stress in plants or
soil, measured in megapascals. A more negative value
indicates greater moisture stress. Soils with no moisture
stress have a water potential of 0 to –1 mPa. The mea-
surement of soil water potential involves the use of sen-
sors that determine the energy status of the water in
soil. The energy state describes the force that holds the
water in the soil. Two methods of measuring soil water
potential are the heat dissipation method or the electri-
cal resistance method.
water table
The level below the earth’s surface at
which the ground becomes saturated with water; usual-
ly mimics the surface contour and is set where hydro-
static pressure equals atmospheric pressure.
water vascular system
An internally closed network
of watery canals in echinoderms (e.g., starfish, sand
346
Wallace’s line

dollars, sea urchins) that draws water from the sur-
rounding sea and passes it through a perforated plate
called the madreporite, which is used for locomotion
and food gathering. Extensions of the water vascular
system are called tube feet, which protrude from the
body, usually ending in suckers, and are used for loco-
motion and for holding on to the sea bottom or prey.
wavelength
The physical distance between points of
corresponding phase of two consecutive cycles of a
wave.
Wegener, Alfred Lothar (1880–1930) German Geo-
physicist, Meteorologist, Climatologist
Alfred Wegen-
er was born in Berlin on November 1, 1880, the son of
a minister who ran an orphanage. He obtained his doc-
torate in planetary astronomy in 1904 at the University
of Berlin. In 1905 Wegener took a job at the Royal
Prussian Aeronautical Observatory near Berlin, study-
ing the upper atmosphere with kites and balloons.
Wegener was an expert balloonist, as proved the fol-
lowing year when he and his brother Kurt set a world
record of 52 consecutive hours in an international bal-
loon contest.
In 1911, at the age of 30, Wegener collected his
meteorology lectures and published them as a book
titled The Thermodynamics of the Atmosphere. It
became a standard in Germany, and Wegener received
acclaim. He also noticed the close fit between the coast-
lines of Africa and South America. He was formulating
his theory of continental drift and began to search for
paleontological, climatological, and geological evidence
in support of his theory.
On January 6, 1912, at a meeting of the Geological
Association in Frankfurt, he spoke about his ideas of
“continental displacement” (continental drift), and pre-
sented his theory again days later at a meeting of the
Society for the Advancement of Natural Science in
Marburg.
In 1914 he was drafted into the German army, was
wounded, and served out the war in the army weather-
forecasting service. While recuperating in a military
hospital, he further developed his theory of continental
drift, which he published the following year as Die
Entstehung der Kontinente und Ozeane (The origin of
continents and oceans). Expanded versions of the book
were published in 1920, 1922, and 1929. Wegener
wrote that around 300 million years ago, the conti-
nents had formed a single mass, called Pangaea (Greek
for “all the Earth”), which split apart, and its pieces
had been moving away from each other ever since.
While he was not the first to suggest that the continents
had once been connected, he was the first to present
the evidence, although he was wrong in thinking that
the continents moved by “plowing” into each other
through the ocean floor. His theory was soundly reject-
ed, although a few scientists did agree with his premise.
In November 1930 he died while returning from a
rescue expedition that brought food to a party of his
colleagues camped in the middle of the Greenland ice
cap. His body was not found until May 12, 1931, but
his friends allowed him to rest forever in the area that
he loved.
The theory of continental drift continued to be
controversial for many years, but by the 1950s and
1960s, plate tectonics was all but an accepted fact and
taught in schools. Today, we know that both continents
and ocean floor float as solid plates on underlying rock
that behaves like a viscous fluid due to being under
such tremendous heat and pressure. Wegener never
lived to see his theory proved. Had he lived, most sci-
entists believe he would have been the champion of
present-day plate tectonics.
Weller, Thomas Huckle (1915–
) American Micro-
biologist
Thomas Huckle Weller was born in Ann
Arbor, Michigan, on June 15, 1915, to Carl Vernon
Weller, who was in the pathology department of the
medical school at the University of Michigan. He
attended this university in 1932 and received a B.A. in
1936 and an M.S. in 1937.
In 1936 he attended Harvard Medical School in
Boston and worked in the facilities in the department
of comparative medicine and tropical medicine. In
1939 he began research on viruses and tissue culture
techniques to study infectious disease. He received an
M.D. in 1940 and began training at the Children’s
Hospital in Boston. After a stint with the Army Medi-
cal Corps during the war, he returned to Boston and
the Children’s Hospital. In 1947 he joined John ENDERS
in the organization of the new research division of
infectious diseases at the Children’s Medical Center. In
1949 he became assistant director of this division and
Weller, Thomas Huckle
347

later became an instructor in the department of com-
parative pathology and tropical medicine and an asso-
ciate professor in the Harvard Medical School of Public
Health. In July 1954 he was appointed Richard Pear-
son Strong Professor of Tropical Public Health and
head of the department at the Harvard School of Public
Health. From 1966 to 1981 he was director of Har-
vard’s Center for the Prevention of Infectious Diseases.
He contributed a great deal of research on the
helminthes parasites of humans, particular on the
nematode Trichirella spiralis and schistosome trema-
todes, which cause schistosomiasis. He isolated the
viruses of varicella and herpes zoster, showing that one
caused both diseases. In 1955 he also isolated a virus
that causes cytomegalic inclusion disease in infants.
Together with J. F. Enders and F. C. ROBBINS, he was
awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in physiology or
medicine for work in growing polio viruses in cultures
of different tissues.
West Nile disease or fever
A mosquito-borne dis-
ease that can cause encephalitis, or inflammation of the
brain, and caused by a flavivirus. West Nile fever is a
disease that has occurred before in Egypt, Asia, Israel,
South Africa, and parts of Europe, but it had never
before been found in the Western Hemisphere until
recently, appearing in America in 1999. In 2003, West
Nile virus had killed 223 people in the United States,
and there were 9,122 confirmed human cases of the
disease worldwide. Closely related to the St. Louis
encephalitis.
Whipple, 
George 
Hoyt (1878–1976) American
Pathologist
George Hoyt Whipple was born on
August 28, 1878, in Ashland, New Hampshire, to Dr.
Ashley Cooper Whipple and Frances Hoyt. Whipple
was educated at Phillips Academy in Andover and
received a B.A. at Yale University in 1900. He then
completed course work at Johns Hopkins University
and received his M.D. degree in 1905, when he was
appointed assistant in pathology at the Johns Hopkins
Medical School. In 1914 he was appointed professor
of research medicine at the University of California
Medical School and was named director of the Hooper
Foundation for Medical Research at that university,
serving as dean of the medical school during the years
1920 and 1921. In 1921 he was appointed professor
of pathology and dean of the School of Medicine and
Dentistry at the University of Rochester and became
the founding dean of the university’s School of
Medicine (1921–53) and chair of the pathology
department.
Whipple’s main researches were concerned with
anemia and the physiology and pathology of the liver.
In 1908 he began a study of bile pigments that led to
his interest in the body’s manufacture of the oxygen-
carrying hemoglobin, an important element in the pro-
duction of bile pigments. His studies dealt with the
effect of foods on the regeneration of blood cells and
hemoglobin in 1918. Between 1923 and 1925, his
experiments in artificial anemia were instrumental in
determining that iron is the most potent inorganic fac-
tor in the formation of red blood cells.
For his work on liver research and treatment of
anemia, he was awarded, together with GEORGE R.
MINOT and WILLIAM P. MURPHY, the Nobel Prize in
physiology or medicine in 1934. Whipple published
many scientific papers in physiological journals.
He died on February 2, 1976, in Rochester, New
York. His birthplace home on Pleasant Street in Ash-
land was listed on the National Register in 1978.

genotype in natural breeding populations.
Wilson’s disease
An inherited condition in which
copper fails to be excreted in the bile. Copper accumu-
lates progressively in the liver, brain, kidney, and red

mosome) and two sex chromosomes. In females, the
sex chromosomes are the two X chromosomes, and in
males there is one X chromosome and one Y chromo-
some.
xenobiotic
A xenobiotic (Greek xenos “foreign”
bios “life”) is a compound that is foreign to a living
organism. Principal xenobiotics include drugs, carcino-
gens, and various compounds that have been intro-
duced into the environment by artificial means.
xenodiagnosis
A way to test, using laboratory-bred
organisms, the diagnosis of certain parasitic diseases
(like Trypanosoma cruzi
[Chagas’ disease] and
Trichinella spiralis [trichinosis] infection) when it is not
possible to identify the infecting organism.
xeric
Dry and hot habitat, desertlike.
xerophytes
Plants that grow under arid conditions
with low levels of soil and water and have water-
conserving features such as thick cuticles and sunken
stomatal pits.
XO
Sex is determined by genes, called sex-linked
genes. An XO individual has only one chromosome,
and the Y or X is missing. An XO human is viable
and develops ovaries but fails to produce steroid hor-
mones, and so the individual has no puberty and is
infertile. Those with Turner’s syndrome are missing
or have a damaged X chromosome, a condition that
affects about one in every 2,500 females. Certain
organisms, such as caddis, butterflies and moths,
birds, and some fish, have XO sex determination. A
male is produced when two X chromosomes are 
present, and a female is produced when only one 
X chromosome is present. Thus XY produces a
female and XX produces a male in Lepidoptera, the
heterogametic sex being the female in this select
group of organisms.
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES)
See EXTENDED X-RAY ABSORPTION FINE STRUCTURE.
xylem
A tissue found in a plant’s vascular bundle
(above the phloem) and in the center of the plant,
where secondary growth occurs. Its purpose is to bring
water and minerals (nutrients) from the roots upward
throughout the plant.
351
X

There is a primary and secondary xylem. Xylem is
made up of tracheids (long, dead cells that function as
conductors), vessel elements (individual short, wide
cells that make up the vessel, also responsible for water
transport), fibers, and parenchyma cells (act as storage
cells and help in assimilation or wound healing). Both
tracheids and vessels have stiff lignin-containing sec-
ondary cell walls that give them rigidity.
Primary xylem comes from the plants procambium
and contains protoxylem (annular and spiral vessels)
and metaxylem (scalariform, reticulate, and pitted ves-
sels). The secondary xylem comes from the vascular
cambium in plants exhibiting secondary growth, such
as wood.
See also PHLOEM.

xylem
annular
spiral 
scalariform
reticulate
pitted
A tissue found in a plant’s vascular bundle (above the phloem)
and in the center of the plant where secondary growth occurs.

353
Y chromosome
The nuclei of human cells contain 22
autosomes (any chromosome that is not a sex chromo-
some) and two sex chromosomes. In females, the sex
chromosomes are the two X chromosomes, and in males
there is one X chromosome and one Y chromosome.
The presence of the Y chromosome leads to a baby boy.
yeast
Considered to be the oldest “plant” cultivated
by humans. Yeast is a unicellular fungus that belongs to
the family Saccharomycetaceae. It lives in the soil, on
plants, and is airborne, and it has been used in the pro-
duction of bread, beer, and wine because it drives the
process of fermentation. It produces carbon dioxide
and alcohol when in the presence of sugar.
yellow fever
A tropical mosquito-borne viral hep-
atitis caused by an arbovirus (yellow fever virus) from
the Flaviviridae family. It is transmitted by the
mosquitoes Aedes aegypti and Haemagogus capri-
corni, among others.
yolk sac
An extraembryonic tissue (membranous
sac) that is attached to an embryo and contains the
nutritive food yolk. In fish larvae, the alevin-stage
embryos swim with the yolk sac attached until it is
absorbed. In placental mammals, it is vestigial (con-
tains no nutrients). The primitive yolk sac divides into
two parts: one portion becomes the fetal gastrointesti-
nal tract, while the second portion connects to the fetal
body via the vitelline duct and is located in the fluid
space outside the amnion, the extraembryonic coelom.
It produces the embryo’s first blood cells and germ cells
that develop into gonads; is the source of the mucous
membrane of almost the entire intestinal tract; and
deals with the transfer of nutritive fluid to the embryo
from the trophoblast, primary mesenchyme, and
extraembryonic coelom.
Y


355
Z-DNA (zigzag DNA)
A region of DNA that is
“flipped” into a left-handed helix. DNA adopts the Z
configuration when purines and pyrimidines alternate
on a single strand. It may be important in regulating
gene expression in eukaryotes.
zinc finger
A DOMAIN, found in certain DNA-binding
proteins, comprising a HELIX-loop structure in which a
zinc ion is coordinated to two to four cysteine sulfurs,
the remaining LIGANDs being histidines. In many pro-
teins of this type the domain is repeated several times.
See also COORDINATION.
zoned reserve system
An ecosystem preservation
concept where certain lands are preserved and managed
as wild or natural, while areas around it are used and
altered by human activity. Several nations, such as Costa
Rica, have adopted this strategy. Municipal zoning in the
United States is another approach where undeveloped
lands within a community are zoned for various uses
such as industrial, residential, and conservation.
zones
A series of life zones developed in 1889 by
mammalogist Clinton Hart Merriam, who studied the
distribution patterns of plants and animal. His developed
the concept of a life zone. He recognized that similar
zones of vegetation occurred with both increasing lati-
tude and increasing elevation. He named them Arctic-
Alpine, Hudsonian, Canadian, Transition, Upper
Sonoran, and Lower Sonoran.
zoological nomenclature
See BINOMIAL.
zooplankton
Small floating or weakly swimming
invertebrates that are transported by water currents
and eat other plankton. Zooplankton are foraminifera
and radiolarians, tiny crustaceans (Daphnia), as well as
the larval or immature stages of animals like mollusks
(snails and squid), crustaceans (crabs and lobsters),
fish, jellyfish, and sea cucumbers.
zoospore
An asexually produced flagellated, swim-
ming spore.
zwitterionic compound
A neutral compound hav-
ing electrical charges of opposite sign, delocalized or
not, on adjacent or nonadjacent atoms.
zygodactyl
The trait of having two toes pointing 
forward and two toes pointing backward, found in
Z

climbing birds (e.g., parrots, woodpeckers). The first
and fourth toes are directed backward, while it is the
second and third that are forward.
zygomorphic
Flowers that are bilaterally symmetri-
cal; can be bisected into similar halves in only one
plane, thereby forming mirror images.
zygospore
A structure that forms in fungi from the
diploid zygote. It forms sporangia, where meiosis takes
place and forms spores.
zygote
When male (sperm) and female (ovum)
gametes combine, they form a zygote that develops into
an embryo. The zygote is a diploid cell created by the
fusion of the mature male and female gametes, each of
which has a haploid set of chromosomes (23 in
human). Upon fusion, the zygote has two copies of
chromosomes, one from each parent. It is the fertilized
egg before it starts to divide and grow.

BIOCHEMICAL CYCLES
Oxygen cycle Oxygen plays a vital part in the re s p i r a t i o n
of animals and plants.
1 Oxygen in air
2 Oxygen breathed in by animals
3 Carbon dioxide (a carbon-oxygen  compound) bre a t h e d
out by living things as waste
4 Carbon dioxide absorbed by plants and used in photo-
synthesis to make carbohydrate foods
5 Surplus oxygen released into the air by plants as waste
Carbon cycle Plant material is a valuable source of 
carbon. Oxidizing carbon compounds provide energy for
animals and plants.
1 Carbon dioxide (a carbon oxygen compound) in air
2 Carbon dioxide absorbed by plants for making food
3 Plants eaten by animals
4 Carbon dioxide waste breathed out by animals and
plants
5 Dead organisms broken down by bacteria
6 These give off carbon dioxide waste
7 Remains of long-dead plants and microscopic 
organisms forming hydrocarbon fossil fuels: coal, oil,
and gas
8 Carbon dioxide released back into the air by burning
fossil fuels
Nitrogen cycle As an ingredient in proteins and nucleic
acids, nitrogen is vital to all living things.
1 Nitrogen in air
2 Atmospheric nitrogen trapped by some plants’ roots
3 Nitrogen used by plants for making proteins
4 Plant proteins eaten by animals
5 P roteins in dead organisms and body wastes convert e d
to ammonia by bacteria and fungi
6 Ammonia converted to nitrate by other bacteria
7 Nitrate taken up by plant roots

BIOCHEMICAL CYCLES
(continued)
Sulfur cycle Sulfur is in two of the 20 amino acids which
are used by the body to make proteins.
1 Sulfates (sulfur–oxygen compounds) absorbed by plant
roots
2 The oxygen in the sulfate is replaced by hydrogen in a
plant process that produces certain amino acids
3 Plants eaten by animals
4 S u l f u r-containing amino acids of dead plants and 
animals broken down to hydrogen sulfide (which gives
o ff a rotten egg odor) by decomposer micro o rg a n i s m s
5 Sulfur extracted from sulfides by bacteria
6 Other bacteria combine sulfur with oxygen, producing
sulfates
Phosphorus cycle Phosphorus is a vital ingredient of 
proteins, nucleic acids, and some other compounds
found in living things.
1 Phosphates (compounds of phosphorus, hydrogen, and
oxygen) absorbed by plant roots
2 Phosphates used by plants in making organic phos-
phorus compounds
3 Plants eaten by animals
4 Compounds in dead plants and animals broken down
to phosphates by microorganisms
Krebs cycle The Krebs or citric acid cycle is the second
stage of aerobic respiration in which living things 
produce energy from foods. It requires oxygen; enzymes
(proteins that promote but are not used up in chemical
changes) create successive compounds, thus transforming
pyruvate to carbon dioxide and water and releasing 
energy.
1 Acetic acid combines with...
2 Oxaloacetic acid to form...
3 Citric acid. Later changes produce...
4 Aconitic acid
5 Isocitric acid
6 Ketoglutaric acid
7 Succinic acid, carbon dioxide, and energy-rich ATP
(adenosine triphosphate) 
8 Fumaric acid  
9 Malic acid
