Abstract
Citing papers is the primary method through
which modern scientific writing discusses and
builds on past work. Collectively, citing a di-
verse set of papers (in time and area of study)
is an indicator of how widely the community
is reading. Yet there is little work looking at
broad temporal patterns of citation. This work,
systematically and empirically examines: How
far back in time do we tend to go to cite pa-
pers? How has that changed over time, and
what factors correlate with this citational atten-
tion/amnesia? We chose NLP as our domain of
interest, and analyzed ∼71.5K papers to show
and quantify several key trends in citation. No-
tably, ∼62% of cited papers are from the imme-
diate five years prior to publication, whereas
only ∼17% are more than ten years old. Fur-
thermore, we show that the median age and age
diversity of cited papers was steadily increas-
ing from 1990 to 2014, but since then the trend
has reversed, and current NLP papers have an
all-time low temporal citation diversity. Finally,
we show that unlike the 1990s, the highly cited
papers in the last decade were also papers with
the least citation diversity; likely contributing
to the intense (and arguably harmful) recency
focus. Code, data, and a demo are available at
the project homepage. 1 2

Introduction
Study the past if you would define the future.
— Confucius
The goal of scientific research is to create a better
future for humanity. To do this we innovate on
ideas and knowledge from the past. Thus, a central
characteristic of the scientific method and modern
scientific writing is to discuss other work: to build
on ideas, to critique or reject earlier conclusions,

to borrow ideas from other fields, and to situate the
proposed work. Even when proposing something
that others might consider dramatically novel, it
is widely believed that these new ideas have been
made possible because of a number of older ideas
(Verstak et al., 2014). Citation (referring to another
paper in a prescribed format) is the primary mech-
anism to point the reader to these prior pieces of
work and also to assign credit for shaping current
work (Mohammad, 2020a; Rungta et al., 2022).
Thus, we argue that examining citation patterns
across time can lead to crucial insights into what
we value, what we have forgotten, and what we
should do in the future.
Of particular interest is the extent to which good
older work is being forgotten — citational amne-
sia. More specifically, for this paper, we define
citational amnesia as shown below:
Citational Amnesia: the tendency to not
cite enough relevant good work from the
past (more than a few years old).
We cannot directly measure citational amnesia
empirically because determining "enough", "rel-
evance", and "good" require expert researcher judg-
ment. However, what we can measure is the collec-
tive tendency of a field to cite older work. Such an
empirical finding enables reflection on citational
amnesia. A dramatic drop in our tendency to cite
older work should give us cause to ponder whether
we are putting enough effort to read older papers
(and stand on the proverbial shoulders of giants).
Note that we are not saying that old work should
be cited simply because it exists. We are saying
that we should consciously reflect on the diversity
of the papers we explore when conducting research.
Diversity can take many forms, including reading
relevant papers from diverse fields, by authors from
diverse regions, and relevant papers published from
various time periods — the focus of this paper. Ex-
ploring a diverse set of papers allows us to ben-

efit from important and diverse research perspec-
tives. Looking at older literature makes us privy
to broader trends, and informs us in ways that are
beneficial well beyond the immediate work.
Historically, citational amnesia was impacted by
various factors around access and invention. For
example, the invention of the printing press in the
year 1440 allowed a much larger number of peo-
ple to access scientific writing (Eisenstein, 1985).
The era of the internet and digitization of scientific
literature that began in the 1990s also greatly in-
creased the ease with which one could access past
work (Verstak et al., 2014). However, other factors
such as the birth of paradigm-changing technolo-
gies may also impact citation patterns; ushering in
a trend of citing very new work or citing work from
previously ignored fields of work. Such dramatic
changes are largely seen as beneficial; however,
strong tailwinds may also lead to a myopic focus
on recent papers and those from only some areas,
at the expense of benefiting from a wide array of
work (Pan et al., 2018; Martín-Martín et al., 2016).
We choose as our domain of interest, papers
on Natural Language Processing (NLP), specifi-
cally those in the ACL Anthology. This choice is
motivated by the fact that NLP (and other related
fields of Artificial Intelligence) are in a period of
dramatic change: There are notable and frequent
gains on benchmark datasets; NLP technology is
becoming increasingly ubiquitous in society; and
new sub-fields of NLP such as Computational So-
cial Science, Ethics and NLP, and Sustainable NLP
are emerging at an accelerated rate. The incredibly
short research-to-production cycle and move-fast-
and-break-things attitude in NLP (and Machine
Learning more broadly) has also led to considerable
adverse outcomes for various sections of society,
especially those with the least power (Buolamwini
and Gebru, 2018; ARTICLE19, 2021; Mohammad,
2021). Thus reading and citing more broadly is
especially important now.
In this work, we compiled a temporal citation
network of 71.5K NLP papers that were published
between 1990 and 2021, along with their meta-
information such as the number of citations they
received in each of the years since they were pub-
lished — the Age of Citations (AoC) dataset. We
use AoC to answer a series of specific research
questions on what we value, what we have forgot-
ten, what factors are associated with this citational
attention/amnesia, what are the citation patterns
of different types of papers, and how these citation
patterns have changed over time. Finally, we show
that many of the highly cited papers from the past
decade have very low temporal citation diversity;
and because of their wide reach, may have con-
tributed to the intense recency focus in NLP. All of
the data and code associated with the project will
be made freely available on the project homepage.

Related Work
In the broad area of Scientometrics (study of quan-
titative aspects of scientific literature), citations
and their networks have been studied from several
perspectives, including: paper quality (Buela-Casal
and Zych, 2010), field of study (Costas et al., 2009),
novelty, length of paper (Antoniou et al., 2015;
Falagas et al., 2013), impact factor (Callaham et al.,
2002), venue of publication (Callaham et al., 2002;
Wahle et al., 2022), language of publication (Lira
et al., 2013), and number of authors (Della Sala
and Brooks, 2008; Bosquet and Combes, 2013),
collaboration (Nomaler et al., 2013), self-citation
(Costas et al., 2010), as well as author’s reputation
(Collet et al., 2014), affiliation (Sin, 2011; Lou and
He, 2015), geographic location (Nielsen and Ander-
sen, 2021; Lee et al., 2010; Pasterkamp et al., 2007;
Paris et al., 1998), gender, race and age (Ayres and
Vars, 2000; Leimu and Koricheva, 2005; Chatterjee
and Werner, 2021; Llorens et al., 2021).
However, there has been relatively little work
exploring the temporal patterns of citation. Verstak
et al. (2014) analyzed scholarly articles published
in 1990–2013 to show that the percentage of older
papers being cited steadily increased from 1990
to 2013, for seven of the nine fields of study ex-
plored. (They treated papers that were published
more than ten years before a particular citation as
old papers.) For Computer Science papers pub-
lished in 2013, on average, 28% of the cited papers
were published more than ten years before. This
represented an increase of 39% from 1990. They
attributed this increasing trend in citing old papers
to the ease of access of scientific literature on the
world wide web, as well as the then relatively new
scientific-literature-aggregating services such as
Google Scholar.
Parolo et al. (2015) analyzed about 25 million
papers from Clinical Medicine, Molecular Biology,
Physics, and Chemistry published until 2014 to
show that typically the number of citations a pa-
per receives per year increases in the years after

publication, reaches a peak, and then decays expo-
nentially. Interestingly they showed that this rate
of decay was increasing in the more recent papers
of their study. They attribute this quicker decay (or
more “forgetting” of recent papers) to the substan-
tial increase in the number of publications; a lot
more papers are being published, and due to the
limited attention span of subsequent researchers,
on average, papers are being forgotten faster.
Past work on NLP papers and their citations in-
cludes work on gender bias (Schluter, 2018; Vogel
and Jurafsky, 2012; Mohammad, 2020b), author
location diversity (Rungta et al., 2022), author in-
stitution diversity (Abdalla et al., 2023), and on
broad general trends such as average number of ci-
tations over time and by type of paper (Mohammad,
2020a,c; Wahle et al., 2022).
Bollmann and Elliott (2020) were the first to
explore the recency bias of citations in NLP pa-
pers. They showed that the ACL Anthology pa-
pers published between 2017 and 2019 cited more
recent work than papers published between 2010
and 2014. Question 3 in Section 4 of our paper
is of the same spirit that was explored in their
work; however, our work examines a much larger
spread of NLP papers (published between 1965 and
2021). This will shed light on the reproducibility
of those findings and, more importantly, determine
the broader trajectory of temporal citation patterns
(from the start of ACL to present day). Addition-
ally, our work introduces a new citation age di-
versity metric to quantify the degree of spread of
citations over time, as well as an interactive online
demo system to visualize the citation age diversity
of any paper. Going beyond how overall citation
patterns have changed over time, our work takes a
deep dive into six other novel research questions,
notably around temporal citation patterns in sub-
areas of NLP, of cited topics, and across sparsely
and highly cited papers.

Dataset
The ACL Anthology (AA) Citation Corpus (Rungta
et al., 2022) contains meta data (paper title, year of
publication, and venue, etc. for the 71,568 papers
in the ACL Anthology repository (published until
January 2022). We used the Semantic Scholar API3
to gather the references for each paper in the AA
Citation Corpus, using the paper’s unique Seman-
tic Scholar ID (SSID). This allowed us to obtain

additional information about the cited papers, such
as their title, year of publication, and venue of pub-
lication. Note that these cited papers may or may
not be part of AA. To study the dynamics of cita-
tions over time, we constructed year-wise citation
networks using the data collected. Specifically, we
created the citation networks for every year from
1965 to 2001. This representation of citation data
allows us to answer several interesting questions,
such as the number of citations a paper receives in
a particular year after its publication. We refer to
this dataset as Age of Citations (AoC) dataset.
4
Age of Citation
We used the AoC dataset to answer a series of
questions on how research papers are cited and the
trends across years.
Q1. What is the average number of unique
references in the AA papers? How does this
number vary by publication type, such as
workshop, conference, and journal? Has this
average stayed roughly the same or has it
changed markedly over the years?
Ans. We calculated the average number of unique
references for all papers in the AoC dataset, as well
as for each publication type (workshops, confer-
ences, and journals). We then binned all papers by
publication year, computed the mean and median
for each bin for each year.

Results
The scores are shown in Table 1. Fig-
ure 1 shows how the mean has changed across the
years.4 The graph shows a general upward trend.
The trend seems roughly linear until the mid 2000s,
at which point we see that the slope of the trend
line increases markedly. Even just considering the
last 7 years, there has been a 41.74% increase in
referenced papers in 2021 compared to 2014.
Similar overall trends can be observed when
papers are grouped by publication type. Not sur-
prisingly, the longer journal articles cite markedly
more papers than conference and workshop
papers. The plot for conferences and workshops
is relatively smooth compared to journal articles.
This is because the number of papers for each year
in journals is far less. For example, in the year
2015, only 139 papers were published in journals,
whereas 1709 and 983 papers were published in
conferences and workshops respectively.
Discussion
The steady increase in the number
of unique references from 1965 is likely because
of the increasing number of relevant papers as the
field develops and grows. However, it is interest-
ing that this growth has not plateaued even after
55 years. By the late-2000s, with the advent of
widely accessible electronic proceedings, *ACL
venues started experimenting with more generous
page limits: relaxing it from a strict 8 pages to first
allowing one or two additional pages for references
to eventually allowing unlimited pages for refer-
ences.5 Other factors that may have contributed
to more papers being referred to (cited) within a
paper, include: an additional page for incorporating
reviewer comments, allowing Appendices, and the
inclusion of an increasing number of experiments.
Q2. On average, how far back in time do we go
to cite papers? As in, what is the average age of
cited papers? What is the distribution of this
age across all citations? How do these vary by
publication type?
Ans. If a paper x cites a paper yi, then the age
of the citation (AoC) is taken to be the difference
between the year of publication (YoP) of x and yi:
AoC(x, yi) = YoP(x) −YoP(yi)
(1)
4The numbers of AA papers published each year until 1990
were rather low, and so in Figure 1, we only show the trajectory
from 1990. However, note that the numbers generally increase
even from 1965 to 1990.
5In 2008, EMNLP became the first major NLP venue to
allow an extra page for references. (ACL followed in 2009.)
We calculated the AoC for each of the citations
in the AoC dataset.
For each paper, we also
calculated the mean AoC of all papers cited by it:
mAoC(x) = 1
N
N
∑
i=1
AoC(x, yi)
(2)
here N refers to the number of papers cited by x.
Results
The average mAoC for all the papers in
the AoC dataset is 6.01. The scores were 7.16 for
journal articles, 5.91 for conference papers, and
6.01 for workshop papers. Figure 2 shows the
distribution of AoCs in the dataset across the years
after the publication of the cited paper (overall, and
across publication types). For example, the y-axis
point for year 0 corresponds to the average of the
percentage of citations papers received in the same
year as it they were published. The y-axis point for
year 1 corresponds to the average of percentage of
citations the papers received in the year after they
were published. And so on.
Observe that the majority of the citations are
for papers published one year prior, (AoC = 1).
This is true for conference and workshop subsets
as well, but in journal papers, the most frequent
citations are for papers published two years prior.
Overall though all the arcs have a similar shape,
rising sharply from the number in year 0 to the peak
value and then dropping off at an exponential rate in
the years after the peak is reached. For the full set
of citations, this exponential decay from the peak
has a half life of about 4 years. Roughly speaking,
the line plot for journals is shifted to the right by
a year compared to the line plots for conferences
and workshops. It also has a lower peak value and
its citations for the years after the peak are at a
higher percentage than those for conferences and
workshops. Additionally, citations in workshop
papers have the highest percentage of current year
citations (age 0), whereas citations in journal article
have the lowest percentage of current year citations.
Analogous to Figure 2, Figure 3 presents the dis-
tribution of AoCs, albeit broken down by the total
citations received by a paper. It is worth noting that
the distribution leans more towards the right for pa-
pers with a higher number of citations. This shows
that papers with a higher citation count continue to
receive significant citations even far ahead in the
future, which is intuitive.
Discussion
Overall, we observe that papers are
cited most in years immediately after publication,
and their chances of citation fall exponentially after

and by publication type).

ferent citation counts (shown in legend).
that. The slight right-shift for the journal article
citations is likely, at least in part, because journal
submissions have a long turn-around time from the
first submission to the date of publication (usually
between 6 and 18 months). A list of the oldest pa-
pers cited by AA papers is available on the project’s
GitHub repository.
Q3. What is the trend in the variation of AoC
AoC
AoC
over time and how does this variation differ
across different publication venues in NLP?
Ans. To answer this question, we split the papers
into bins corresponding to the year of publication,
and then examined the distribution of mAoC in
each bin. We define a new metric called the Cita-
tion Age Diversity (CAD) Index, which measures
the diversity in the mAoC for a set of papers. In
simpler terms, a higher CAD Index indicates that
mAoCs covers a broader range, implying that the
cited papers span a wider time period of publica-
tion. This metric offers valuable insights into the
temporal spread of scholarly influence and the long-
term impact of research. Precisely, the CAD Index
for a bin of papers b, is defined using the Gini
Figure 4: Citation Age Diversity Index across years.
Coefficient as follows:
CAD(b) = 1−
N
∑
i=1
N
∑
j=1
∣mAoC(bi) −mAoC(bj)∣
2N2¯b
(3)
here, bi corresponds to ith paper within bin b, N
denotes the total number of papers in bin b and ¯b
represents the mean of mAoC of papers’ associ-
ated with bin b. A CAD Index close to 0 indicates
minimum temporal diversity in citations (citing pa-
pers from just one year), whereas a CAD Index
of 1 indicates maximum temporal diversity in cita-
tions (citing papers uniformly from past years). In
addition to CAD Index, we also compute median
mAoC of each such yearly bin. The results for
both CAD Index and median mAoC have roughly
identical trends across the years. We discuss the
CAD Index analysis below. (The discussion of the
median mAoC results is in the Appendix A.1.)
Results
Figure 4 shows the CAD Index across
years (higher CAD Index indicates high diversity),
and across different publication types. The CAD
Index plot of Figure 4 shows that the temporal di-
versity of citations had an increasing trend from
1990 to 2014, but the period from 1998 to 2004,
and 2014 to 2021 (dramatically so) were periods of
decline in temporal diversity (decreasing CAD In-
dex scores). These intervals coincide with the year
intervals in which we observed a decreasing trend
in median mAoC of published papers (discussed
in the Appendix). This suggests that the increase
or decrease in diversity is largely because of the
decreased or increased focus on papers from recent
years, respectively.
The CAD Index plots by publication type all
have similar trends, with journal paper submissions
consistently having markedly higher scores (indi-
cating markedly higher temporal diversity) across
the years studied. However, they also seem to be

most impacted by the trend since 2014 to cite very
recent papers. (CAD Index not only goes back to
the 1990 level, but also undershoots beyond it.)
Discussion
Overall, we find that all the gains in
temporal diversity of citations from 1990 to 2014
(a period of 35 years), have been negated in the 7
years from 2014. This change is driven largely by
the deep neural revolution in the early 2010’s and
strengthened further by the substantial impact of
transformers on NLP and Machine Learning. In-
terestingly, our results until 2013 are in line with
what Verstak et al. (2014) found for many fields of
study, but since 2014 there has been a marked shift
in trends in NLP. We hope future work will explore
whether similar shifts in trends have occurred in
other fields. Our results add to (and are consis-
tent with) the mean-citation age results found by
Bollmann and Elliott (2020), who examined mean
citation age between 2010 and 2019. Our analysis
of the broader period (from 1965 to 2021), situ-
ates those results in the overall trajectory of how
temporal citation patterns have evolved since the
beginning of the Association of Computational Lin-
guistics to the present period. Additionally, the new
CAD Index metric quantifies the degree temporal
citation diversity as opposed to the recency focus
of citations captured by mean citation age.
Q4. What percentage of cited papers are old
papers? How has this varied across years and
publication venues?
Ans. Just as Verstak et al. (2014), we define a cited
paper as older if it was published at least ten years
prior to the citing paper. We then divided all AA
papers into groups based on the year in which they
were published. For each AA paper, we determined
the number of citations to older papers.
Results
Figure 5 shows the percentage of older
papers cited by papers published in different years.
Observe that this percentage increased steadily
from 1990 to 1999, before decreasing until 2002.
After 2002, the trend of citing older papers picked
up again; reaching an all time high of ∼30% by
2014. However, since 2014, the percentage of ci-
tations to older papers has dropped dramatically,
falling by 12.5% and reaching a historical low of
∼17.5% in 2021. Similar patterns are observed for
different publication types. However, we note that
a greater (usually around 5% more) percentage of
a journal paper’s citations are to older papers, than
in conference and workshop papers.
Discussion
These results confirm that the trends
in diversity discussed in Q2 are aligned with the
trends in citing older papers. This dramatic drop
in citing older papers since 2014 can largely be
attributed to the explosion of paper count and the
paradigm shift in the field of NLP brought on by
deep learning and transformers.
Q5. What is the mAoC
mAoC
mAoC distribution for differ-
ent areas within NLP? Relative to each other,
which areas tend to cite more older papers and
which areas have a strong bias towards recent
papers?
Ans. The ACL Anthology does not include meta-
data for sub-areas within NLP. Further, a paper may
be associated with more than one area and the dis-
tinction between areas can often be fuzzy. Thus, we
follow a rather simple approach used earlier in Mo-
hammad (2020b): using paper title word bigrams
as indicators of topics relevant to the paper. A paper
with machine translation in the title is likely to be
relevant to the area of machine translation. Using
title bigrams for this analysis also allows for a finer
analysis within areas. For example, two bigrams
pertaining to finer subareas within the same area
can be examined separately. (Papers in different
sub-areas of an area need not be similar in terms of
the age of the papers they cite.)
We first compiled a list of the top 60 most fre-
quent bigrams from the titles of AA papers. Next,
for each of these bigrams, we created a bin con-
taining all AA papers that had that bigram in their
title.6 For each paper included in any of these bins,
we computed mAoC. Finally, we plotted the distri-
bution of mAoC values for the papers in each bin,
6A single paper may be included in multiple bins.

as shown in Figure 6. Note that, for the purpose of
improving the visibility of the plot, only selected
mAoC distributions are depicted in the figure 6.
We then examined the distribution of mAoC for
each of these bins.
Results
Figure 6 shows the mAoC violin plots
for each of the bins pertaining to the title bigrams
(in decreasing order of median mAoC). Observe
that papers with the title bigrams word alignment,
parallel corpus/corpora, Penn Treebank, sense dis-
ambiguation and word sense (common in the word
sense disambiguation area), speech tagging, coref-
erence resolution, named entity and entity recog-
nition (common in the named entity recognition
area), and dependency parsing have some of the
highest median mAoC (cite more older papers).
In contrast, papers with the title bigrams glove
vector, BERT pre, deep bidirectional, and bidirec-
tional transformers (which correspond to new tech-
nologies) and papers with title bigrams reading
comprehension, shared task, question answering,
language inference, language models, and social
media (which correspond to NLP subareas or do-
mains) have some of the lowest median mAoC
(cite more recent papers).
Discussion
The above results suggest that not all
NLP subfields are equal in terms of the age of cited
papers. In fact, some papers cited markedly more
newer papers than others. This could be due to fac-
tors such as early adoption or greater applicability
of the latest developments, the relative newness of
the area itself (possibly enabled by new inventions
such as social media), etc.
Q6. What topics are more pronounced in cited
papers across different periods of time?
Ans. To address this question, we partitioned the re-
search papers into those published between: 1990–
1999, 2000–2009, 2010–2015, and 2016–2021.7
For papers from each period: we first extracted all
unigrams and bigrams from the titles of the cited
papers. Next, for the top 100 most frequent uni-
grams and bigrams, we calculated the percentage
of all citations that had the respective ngram in the
cited paper’s title — the ngram citation percentage.
Results
Upon examining various bigram citation
percentages, we found that bigrams pertaining to
areas such as tree-adjoining grammars have been
in decline since the 1990s (cited less as with ev-
ery subsequent interval). Bigrams pertaining to
areas such as conditional random fields and coref-
erence resolution gained momentum in the middle
periods (2000–2016) but have since lost popularity
post-2016. On the other hand, techniques such as
domain adaptation have consistently gained mo-
mentum since the 2010s. Post-2016 keywords re-
lated to deep learning technologies such as con-
volutional neural nets, deep bi-directional, deep
learning, deep neural, Global vectors, and jointly
learning experienced a substantial surge in popular-
ity. Additionally, certain areas such as cross-lingual
and entity recognition consistently gained momen-
tum since the 1990s.
Upon examining various unigram citation per-
centages, we found that deep-learning-related
terms such as attention, bert, deep, neural, em-
beddings, and recurrent saw a substantial increase
in citation post-2016. Furthermore, we observed
that since the 1990s, there has been a growing trend
in NLP papers towards citing research on the so-
cial aspects of language processing, as evidenced
by the increasing popularity of keywords such as
social and sentiment.
7The 2010–2021 period was split into two because of the
large number of papers published.

Figures 9 and 10 in the Appendix show a number
of unigrams and bigrams with the most notable
changes in the ngram citation percentage across the
chosen time intervals.
Q7. Do well-cited papers cite more old papers
and have more AoC
AoC
AoC diversity?
Ans.
We introduce three hypotheses to explore
the correlation between temporal citation patterns
of target papers and the number of citations the
target papers themselves get in the future.
H1. The degree of citation has no correlation with
temporal citation patterns of papers.
H2. Highly cited papers have more temporal cita-
tion diversity than less cited papers.
H3. Highly cited papers have less temporal cita-
tion diversity than less cited papers.
Without an empirical experiment, it is difficult to
know which hypothesis is true. H1 seemed likely,
however, there were reasons to suspect H2 and H3
also. Perhaps cite more widely is correlated with
other factors such the quality of work and thus
correlates with higher citations (supporting H2).
Or, perhaps, early work in a new area receives lots
of subsequent citations and work in a new area
often tends to have limited citation diversity as
there is no long history of publications in the area
(supporting H3).
On, Nov 30, 2022, we used the Semantic Scholar
API to extract the number of citations for each of
the papers in the AoC dataset. We divided the AoC
papers into nine different bins as per the number
of citations: 0, 1–9, 10–49, 50–99, 100–499, 500–
999, 1000–1999, 2000–4999, or 5000+ citations.
For each bin, we calculated the mean of mAoC
and CAD Index. We also computed the Spearman’s
Rank Correlation between the CAD Index of the
citation bins and the mean of the citation range of
each of these bins.
Results
Figure 7 shows the mAoC and CAD In-
dex for each bin (a) for the full AoC dataset, and (b)
for the subset of papers published between 1990
and 2000. (Figures 11a and 11b in the Appendix
show plots for papers from two additional time pe-
riods.) On the full dataset (Figure 7a), we observe
a clear pattern that the CAD Index decreases with
increasing citation bin (with the exception of pa-
pers in the 1K–2K and 2K–5K bins). The mean
mAoC follows similar trend w.r.t. the CAD Index.

time periods. The ∗indicates statistically significant
correlation (p-value < 0.05).
These results show that, for the full dataset, the
higher citation count papers tend to have less tem-
poral citation diversity than lower-citation count
papers. However, on the 1990s subset (Figure 7b),
the CAD Index decreased till the citation count < 50
and increased markedly after that. This shows that
during the 1990s, the highly cited papers also cited
papers more widely in time. Plots for the 2000s
and 2010s (Figure 11) follow a similar trend as the
overall plot (Figure 7a), indicating that trend of
highly cited papers having less temporally diverse
citations started around the year 2000.
The Spearman’s rank Correlation Coefficients
between the mean number of citations for a bin
and the mean mAoC of the citation bins are shown
in Table 2.8 Observe that for the 1990’s papers
there is essentially no correlation, but there are
strong correlations for the 2000s, 2010s, and the
full dataset papers.
Similar to Figure 7a, in Figure 12 (in the Ap-
pendix) we show how mean mAoC and CAD Index
of AA papers published between 1965 and 2021
but when broken down by research topics. This
examination across various research topics consis-
tently shows a trend: the higher the citations, the
lower the age diversity of citations. This may be
because “mainstream” work in an area tends to cite
lots of other very recent work and brings in pro-
portionately fewer ideas from the past. In contrast,
“non-mainstream” work tends to incorporate pro-
portionally more ideas from outside, yet receives
fewer citations as there may be less future work in
that space to cite it.
Discussion
Papers may receive high citations for
a number of reasons; and those that receive high
citations are not necessarily model research papers.
While they may have some aspects that are appreci-
ated by the community (leading to high citations),
they also have flaws. High-citation papers (by def-
inition) are more visible to the broader research
community and are likely to influence early re-
searchers more. Thus their strong recency focus in
8We did not consider 2016–2021 papers because they have
had only a few years to accumulate citations.

citations is a cause of concern. Multiple anecdotal
incidents in the community have suggested how
early researchers often consider papers that were
published more than two or three years back as "old
papers". This goes hand-in-hand with a feeling that
they should not cite old papers and therefore, do
not need to read them. The lack of temporal cita-
tion diversity in recent highly cited papers may be
perpetuating such harmful beliefs.

Demo: CAD Index of Your Paper
To encourage authors to be more cognizant of the
age of papers they cite, we created an online demon-
stration page where one can provide the Semantic
Scholar ID of any paper and the system returns the
number of papers referenced, mean Age of Cita-
tion (mAoC), top-5 oldest cited papers, and their
years of publication.9 Notable, the demo also plots
the distribution of mAoC for all the considered pa-
pers (all papers published till 2021) and compares
it with mean Age of Citation of the input paper.
Figure 13 in the Appendix shows a screenshot of
the demo portal for an example input.

Conclusions and Discussion
This work looks at temporal patterns of citations
by presenting a set of comprehensive analyses of
the trend in the diversity of age of citations and the
percentage of older papers cited in the field of NLP.
To enable this analysis, we compiled a dataset of
papers from the ACL Anthology and their meta-
information; notably, the number of citations they
received each year since they were published.

demo:
https://huggingface.co/spaces/
mrungta8/CitationalAmnesia/
We showed that both the diversity of age of ci-
tations and the percentage of older papers cited
increased from 1990 to 2014, but since then there
has been a dramatic reversal of the trend. By the
year 2021 (the final year of analysis), both the di-
versity of age of citations and the percentage of
older papers cited have reached historical lows. We
also studied the correlation between the number
of citations a paper receives and the diversity of
age of cited papers, and found that while there
was roughly no correlation in the 1990s, the 2000s
marked the beginning of a period where the higher
citation levels correlated strongly with lower tem-
poral citation diversity.
It is a common belief among researchers in the
field that the advent of deep neural revolution in the
early 2010’s has led us to cite more recent papers
than before. This analysis confirms and quantifies
the extent to which temporal diversity is reduced
in this recent period. In fact, it shows that the
reduction in temporal diversity of citations is so
dramatic that it has wiped out steady gains from
1990 to 2014. While some amount of increased
focus on recent papers is expected (and perhaps
beneficial) after large technological advances, an
open question, now, is whether, as a community, we
have gone too far, ignoring important older work.
Our work calls for an urgent need for reflection on
the intense recency focus in NLP: How are we con-
tributing to this as researchers, advisors, reviewers,
area chairs, and funding agencies?10
10This paper cites 16 papers published ten or more years
back (35% of the cited papers).

Ethics Statement
This paper analyses scientific literature at an ag-
gregate level. The ACL Anthology freely provides
information about NLP papers, such as their title,
authors, and year of publication. We do not make
use of or redistribute any copyrighted information.
All of the analyses in this work are at aggregate-
level, and not about individual papers or authors.
In fact, we desist from showing any breakdown
of results involving 30 or fewer papers to avoid
singling out a small group of papers.

Limitation
A limitation of this study is that it is based solely
on papers published in the ACL Anthology, which
primarily represents the international English-
language NLP conference community. While the
ACL Anthology is a reputable source of NLP
research, it should be acknowledged that a sig-
nificant amount of research is also published in
other venues such as AAAI, ICLR, ICML, and
WWW. Additionally, there are also vibrant local
NLP communities and venues, often publishing
in non-English languages, that are not represented
in the ACL Anthology. As a result, the conclu-
sions drawn from our experiments may not fully
capture the global landscape of NLP research and
further work is needed to explore the diversity of
sub-communities and venues across the world.
This work focuses on the aggregate trends of cit-
ing older work in NLP, but does not investigate the
reasons for lower citation of certain older papers.
There may be various factors that contribute to this,
such as the accessibility to these older papers, the
large number of recent papers, the applicability of
these old works, and the technical relevance of the
older work. Determining the relative impact of
each reason is a challenging task. Therefore, more
research is needed to fully understand the underly-
ing mechanisms that influence the citation of older
NLP papers.
This study aims to investigate the factors that
contribute to the citation of older works in the field
of NLP. We have analyzed different factors such
as the mean age of citation, diversity in the age
of citations, venue of publication, and subfield of
research. Our results indicate that these factors
are associated with the citation of older works, but
it should be noted that these associations do not
establish any causal relationship between them.
Lastly, it is important to note that citations can
be heterogeneous and can be categorized in dif-
ferent ways. For example, some classifications of
citations include background, method, and result
citations. However, certain citations may be more
important than others, as shown by previous re-
search such as "Identifying Meaningful Citations"
by (Valenzuela-Escarcega et al., 2015).

Supplementary Statistics and Plots
In addition to the primary results presented in the
main body of the paper, here, we describe included
supplementary material in the form of additional
statistics and plots.

Q3 Results Supplement: Distribution of
mAoC
mAoC
mAoC Over Years
Figure 8 shows the violin plots for distributions
of mAoC across various years. If a paper x was
published in year t, then mAoC(x) will be a data
point for plotting the distribution for year t. The
median mAoC for a given year (marked with a
white dot within the grey rectangle) reflects the
recency of citations, with a lower median mAoC
indicating that papers published in that year have
cited relatively recent papers.
The two halves of the grey rectangle on either
side of the median correspond to the second and
third quartiles. Observe that the third quartile is
always longer (spread across more years than the
second quartile. This shows that the rate at which
papers are cited is higher in years before the median
than in the years after the median. The violin plots
indicate that the distributions have a single peak in
each of the years considered.
Observe that the median mAoC has an increas-
ing trend from 1990 to 2014 (a trend towards cit-
ing more older papers) with the exception of a
period between 1998 and 2004 when the median
decreased. However, most notably, from 2014 on-
ward the median mAoC decreased markedly with
every year. (The median mAoC in 2021 is nearly
2.5 years less than that of 2014.)

The blue line in Figure 8 is the mean mAoC.
The mean follows a similar trend as the median,
with slight variations. In particular, it is consis-
tently higher than the median, indicating that the
data is skewed to the right, with a few papers hav-
ing large mAoC that significantly affect the mean.

Q6 Results Supplement: Pronounced
Topics in the Cited Papers Across Year
Intervals
We investigated the distribution of the most fre-
quent unigrams and bigrams (ngrams) found in the
title of cited papers, grouped by the publication
years of the citing paper. Figures 9 and 10 show
the unigrams and bigrams with notable changes in
citation percentages across the chosen time inter-
vals. A single star (*) indicates that the change in
the ngram’s percentage from the minimum inter-
val value to maximum interval value is more than
1500% for unigrams and 3000% for bigrams. A
double star (**) denotes that the ngram was not
cited at all in at least one of the intervals.

Q7 Results Supplement: Variation of
mAoC
mAoC
mAoC and CAD Index Across Citation
Count Bins
Table 3 shows the number of papers in each citation
bin for different segments of papers. We can see
that for all the time periods most of the papers have
a citation count < 50.
Figures 11a and 11b show the variation of mean
mAoC and CAD Index for subsets of papers pub-
lished between 2001 to 2010 and 2011 to 2016,
respectively. These two plots follow a similar pat-
tern to Figure 7a on the full AoC dataset. The CAD
Index decreases with increasing the citation bin
and the mean mAoC also varies inversely with the
citation bin.
