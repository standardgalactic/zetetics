Probability and Uncertainty 
Frequentist (aleatory): 
• Confident when based on 
much observation evidence 
• Unconfident when based on 
little observation evidence 
• E.g.: Probability of heads 
when flipping coin is ½       
and confident 
 
 
 
Subjective (epistemic):  
• Confident when dynamics 
of situation are known 
• Unconfident when 
dynamics of situation are 
unknown 
• E.g. Probability of Oswald 
killed Kennedy is  ½   but 
unconfident

• Powerset P (X) = 2X , set of subsets, including {X,∅} 
• Reduced powerset R (X) = P (X) \ {X, ∅} 
• R (X) = { x1, x2, x3, x4, x5, x6 } 
• R (X)  called Hyperdomain 
• Cardinalities 
| X | = 3 in this example 
• |P (X)| = 2|X|  
= 8 in this example 
• |R (X)| = 2|X| − 2   
= 6 in this example

Subjective Logic – UAI 2016 
Mapping categories to opinions 
• Overlay category matrix with opinion triangle 
• Matrix skewed as a function of base rate 
• Not all categories map to opinions 
– For a low base rate, it is impossible to describe an 
event as highly likely and uncertain, but possible to 
describe it as highly unlikely and uncertain. 
– E.g. with regard to tuberculosis which has a low base 
rate, it would be wrong to say that a patient is likely to 
be infected, with high uncertainty. Similarly it would 
be possible to say that the patient is probably not 
infected, with high uncertainty

X={x1…xk} 
• Random variable X ∈X 
• Multinomial opinion:    ωX = (bX, uX, aX) 
 
• Belief mass distribution  bX  where    u + ΣbX (x) = 1 
bX (x)  is belief mass on  x ∈X   
• Uncertainty mass:  uX   is a single value in range [0,1] 
• Base rate distribution  aX where  ΣaX (x) = 1 
aX (x)  is base rate of  x ∈X 
• Projected probability:  PX (x)= bX(x) + aX(x)⋅uX

Non-informative prior weight: W 
• Value normally set to W = 2. 
• When W is equal to the frame cardinality, then 
the prior Dirichlet PDF is a uniform. 
• Normally required that the prior Beta is uniform, 
which  dictates W = 2 
• Beta PDF is a binomial Dirichlet PDF 
• Setting W > 2  would make Dirichlet PDF 
insensitive to new observations, which would be 
an inadequate model.

Functional trust derivation requirement 
•
Functional trust derivation through transitive paths 
requires that the last trust edge represents 
functional trust (or an opinion) and that all previous 
trust edges represent referral trust. 
 
•
Functional trust can be an opinion about a variable.

Example: Medical reasoning 
• Medical test reliability determined by: 
– true positive rate   
 
 
 
 
where  x: infected 
– false positive rate   
 
 
 
 
 
 
y: positive test 
 
• Bayes’ theorem: 
• Probabilistic model hides uncertainty 
• Use subjective Bayes’ theorem to determine ω(infected)  
 
 
• GP derives ω(infected | positive)  and ω(infected | negative)  
• Finally compute diagnosis ω(infected || test result)  
• Medical reasoning with SL reflects uncertainty
