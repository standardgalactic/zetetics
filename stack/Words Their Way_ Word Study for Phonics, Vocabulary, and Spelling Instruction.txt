Letter from the Authors
Dear Educator,
It is an honour for the authors of Words Their Way®: Word Study for Phonics, Vocabulary, and Spelling 
Instruction to present the sixth edition of this seminal text on word study. Accompanying this edition 
is an online resource, PDToolkit for Words Their Way®, featuring classroom video, printable sorts and 
games, online interactive sorts, assessment tools and applications all in one place. These tools will help 
you to effectively implement word study instruction in your classroom.
For the sixth edition, the authors highlight a few key ideas presented in Words Their Way.
Donald
Words Their Way presents a developmental approach that makes word study more efficient and 
responsive. This approach to word study integrates phonics, spelling and vocabulary because of the 
reciprocal nature of literacy: what students learn in spelling transfers to reading, and what they learn in 
reading transfers to spelling and vocabulary. These are not, therefore, three separate and unrelated areas 
of instruction. Integrating phonics, vocabulary and spelling instruction with a developmental approach 
contributes, we hope, to deep and rewarding learning and teaching.
Marcia
Words Their Way has gotten teachers to think about phonics, spelling and vocabulary instruction from a 
completely different point of view. Teachers welcome our ­student-​­centred, ­minds-​­on, active approach 
that considers word study not only as an integral part of literacy development, but also as an integral 
vehicle for fostering critical thinking. Effective word study lessons pose questions and involve students 
in solving problems through careful analysis, reflection and discussion. The questions teachers pose 
during words study—such as, “Why do some words end in a silent e?”—encourage an investigative 
mindset, and give purpose for engaging in word study activities such as word sorts. The language we 
use when we talk with students about words has a powerful influence on their ­self-​­efficacy as learners. 
This is in sharp contrast to most phonics and spelling programmes that merely ask students to 
memorise relationships, rules and words.
Shane
Words Their Way helps teachers provide their students with the breadth and depth of exploration 
necessary to construct knowledge about words over ­time—​­from individual letters to sound, from groups 
of letters to sound and from groups of letters to meaning. Awareness and appreciation of how children 
construct this knowledge empowers and emboldens many teachers to advocate for developmental 
instruction in word study specifically and in literacy more generally. This understanding is now being 

	
L e t t e r  f r o m  t h e  Au t h o r s

applied to instruction in ­vocabulary—​­in particular, general academic vocabulary and ­domain-​­specific 
vocabulary.
Francine
Students learn best when they are working with content that is in their “Zone of Proximal 
Development” or window of opportunity. Words Their Way offers an ­assessment-​­driven developmental 
guide for word study that helps teachers to differentiate instruction to meet children’s needs and 
provides the resources to do so.
Bring your colleagues and come join us in the most active edition of Words Their Way® yet. We wish 
you happy sorting with your students!
Sincerely,
Donald R. Bear  Marcia Invernizzi  Shane Templeton  Francine Johnston

Donald R. Bear is director of the Duffelmeyer Reading Clinic in the School of Education, Iowa 
State University, where he and his students teach and assess students who are experiencing dif-
ficulties learning to read and write. A former elementary teacher, Donald currently researches 
literacy development with a special interest in students who speak different languages. He 
partners with schools and districts to think about how to assess and conduct literacy instruction.
Marcia Invernizzi is executive director of the McGuffey Reading Centre in the Curry School 
of Education at the University of Virginia. She and her multilingual doctoral students enjoy 
exploring developmental universals in ­non-​­English orthographies. A former English and read-
ing teacher, Marcia extends her experience working with children who experience difficulties 
learning to read and write to numerous intervention programmes, such as Virginia’s Early 
Intervention Reading Initiative and Book Buddies.
Shane Templeton is Foundation Professor Emeritus of Literacy Studies in the College of 
Education at the University of Nevada, Reno. A former classroom teacher at the primary and 
secondary levels, his research focusses on the development of orthographic and vocabulary 
knowledge. He has written several books on the teaching and learning of reading and language 
arts and is a member of the Usage Panel of the American Heritage Dictionary.
Francine Johnston is retired from the School of Education at the University of North Carolina

I see and I forget. I hear and I remember. I do and I understand.
—Confucius
Word study involves “doing” things with ­words—​­examining, manipulating, comparing and 
­categorising—​­and offers students the opportunity to make their own discoveries about how 
words work. When teachers use this practical, ­hands-​­on way to study words with students, 
they create tasks that focus students’ attention on critical features of words: sound, pattern 
and meaning.
Words Their Way is a developmental approach to phonics, vocabulary and spelling instruc-
tion. Guided by an informed interpretation of spelling errors and other literacy behaviours, 
Words Their Way offers a systematic, ­teacher-​­directed, ­child-​­centred plan for the study of 
words from kindergarten to high school. Step by step, the chapters explain exactly how to 
provide effective word study instruction. The keys to this ­research-​­based approach are know-
ing your students’ literacy progress, organising for instruction and implementing word study.
NEW to This Edition
• NEW: To enhance thoughtful discussions, a chart in Chapter 3 offers sample questions to 
guide problem solving, reflection, application and transfer.

Preface

PDToolkit for Words Their Way®
A website with media tools accompanies Words Their Way, sixth edition. Together with the text, 
the website provides the tools you need to carry out word study instruction that will motivate 
and engage your students and help them succeed in literacy learning.
The PDToolkit for Words Their Way® is available free for twelve months with the pass-
word that comes with this book. After twelve months, your subscription must be renewed. Be 
sure to explore and download the resources available at the website. The following resources 
are currently available:
• NEW: In addition to all new footage presented with the fifth edition of Words Their 
Way®, the classroom footage added to the sixth edition shows you teachers using word 
study at all of stages of development, including English learners and ­PreK–​­K and second-
ary students.
• An assessment tool provides downloadable inventories and feature guides, as well as inter-
active classroom composites that help you monitor your students’ development through-
out the year.
• Prepared word sorts and games for each stage will help you get started with word study in 
your classroom.
• A Create Your Own feature allows you to modify and create sorts and games and online 
computers.
• Word sorts that can be used with interactive whiteboards are available for each stage.
We will continue to add new other resources.
Knowing Your Students
Chapter 1 provides you with foundational information on word study and the research in 
orthography and literacy development that led to this word study approach. Then, Chap-
ter 2 presents assessment and evaluation tools, walking you step by step through the process 
of determining your students’ instructional level and focussing your word study instruction 
appropriately. After you administer one of the spelling inventories, you will be able to compile 
a feature guide for each of your students that will help you identify their stage and the word 
study features they are ready to master. The classroom composite will identify which students 
have similar instructional needs, allowing you to plan wisely and effectively for word study 
grouping.

The website includes progress monitoring charts and spell checks, enabling you to deter-
mine the effectiveness of instruction on a regular basis and to modify it as needed. On the 
PDToolkit for Words Their Way® you will find assessment resources to download, including:
• Primary Spelling Inventory, feature guide, error guide and classroom composite
• Elementary Spelling Inventory, feature guide, error guide and classroom composite
• ­Upper-​­Level Spelling Inventory, feature guide and classroom composite
• ­Spelling-​­by-​­Stage Organisational Chart
• Qualitative Spelling Checklist
• Emergent Class Record and other emergent assessments
• Word Feature Inventory
• McGuffey Qualitative Spelling Inventory
• Kindergarten Spelling Inventory and Analysis

Organising for Instruction
Chapter 3 outlines the most effective ways to organise word study for classroom instruction. 
We suggest activities for small groups, partners and individuals that can be incorporated into 
weekly routines that will help you manage levelled groups for instruction at all grade levels. 
We also describe a continuum of support that will help you plan and implement lessons to 
maximise classroom time. Tips are provided to help guide discussions about words.
Implementing Word Study
Once you have assessed your students, created levelled groups and developed routines for 
word study, the information and materials in Chapters 4 through 8 and the Appendixes will 
guide your instruction. Chapters 4 through 8 explore the characteristics of each particular 
stage, from the emergent learner through to the advanced reader and writer in the deriva-
tional relations stage of spelling development. Each of these chapters covers the research and 
principles that drive instruction and the most appropriate sequence and instructional pacing.
Activities described in each chapter include concept sorts, word sorts and games, which 
will help you focus instruction where it is needed to move students into the next stage of 
development. These word study activities promise to engage your students, motivate them 
and improve their literacy skills. The activities sections have shaded tabs for your convenience, 
creating a handy classroom resource. New to this edition are additional vocabulary strategies 
for each developmental level.
Importantly, as you work with the Common Core State Standards, you will see how Words Their 
Way supports the Reading Foundational Skills and the Language Standards across all the grades. 
The depth and breadth of word knowledge developed through Words Their Way also supports the 
Common Core’s emphasis on students reading more complex literary and informational texts.
The Appendixes at the back of the book contain most of the assessment instruments 
described in Chapter 2, as well as word sorts, sound boards and game templates you will need 
to get your own word study instruction under way.

or students of all ages and language backgrounds, knowing the ways in which their 
written language represents the language they speak is the key to literacy. In this sixth 
edition, we describe how teachers can most effectively guide and support students’ 
learning about the sounds, structure and meanings of words—crafting our instruction so that 
our students learn about words their way. In addition to demonstrating how a developmental 
approach to word study best supports students’ deep and long-term word learning, this new 
edition further explores how educators may apply this developmental model as they imple-
ment effective and engaging phonics, vocabulary and spelling instruction from preschool 
through the middle grades and beyond, and apply best practices for ongoing progress moni-
toring, response to intervention and scaffolding instruction for multilingual learners. Whether 
you are a long-standing companion on this adventure or joining us for the first time, we wel-
come you on this continuing journey to learn and teach about words their way.
The Braid of Literacy
Literacy is like a braid of interwoven threads. The braid begins with the intertwining threads 
of oral language and stories that are read to children. As children experiment with putting 
ideas on paper, a writing thread is entwined as well. And all along the way, vocabulary is being 
learned and developed. As children move into reading, the threads of literacy begin to bond. 
Students’ growing knowledge of spelling or orthography—the ways in which letters and let-
ter patterns in words represent sound and meaning—strengthens that bonding. The size of the 
threads and the braid itself become thicker as orthographic knowledge grows (see Figure 1.1).
During the preschool years, children acquire word knowledge in a fundamentally aural 
way from the language that surrounds them. Through listening to and talking about every-
day events, life experiences and stories, children develop a speaking vocabulary. As they have 
opportunities to talk about their everyday experiences, children begin to make sense of their 
world and to use language to negotiate and describe it. Children also begin to experiment 
with pen and paper when they have opportunities to observe parents, siblings and caregiv-
ers writing for many purposes. They gradually come to understand the forms and functions 
of written language. The first written words students learn are usually their own names, 
­followed by those of significant others. Words such as Mom, cat and dog and phrases like I love 
you represent people, animals and ideas dear to 
their lives.
As students grow as readers and writers, 
the language of books and print becomes a 
critical component to furthering their literacy 
development. Vocabulary is learned when pur-
poseful reading, writing, listening and speaking 
take place. Even more words can be learned 
when children explicitly examine printed words 
to discover consistencies among them and how 
consistent patterns relate to oral language—to 
speech sounds and to meaning.
A major aim of this book is to demonstrate 
how an exploration of spelling—­orthography— 
can lead to lengthening and strengthening of 
the literacy braid. Teachers must understand 
the ways in which these threads intertwine to 
create this bond so that they can direct chil-
dren’s attention to words their way.

There are similarities in the ways learners of all ages expand their knowledge of the 
world. It seems that humans have a natural interest in finding order and patterns, compar-
ing and contrasting and paying attention to what remains the same despite minor variations. 
Infants learn to recognise Daddy as the same Daddy with or without glasses, with or without 
a hat or whiskers. Through such daily interactions, we categorise our surroundings. Similarly, 
our students expand their vocabularies by comparing one concept with another. Gradually, 
the number of concepts they analyse increases, but the process is still one of comparing and 
contrasting. They may first call anything with four legs “doggie” until they attend to the fea-
tures that distinguish dogs, cats and cows, and later terriers, Labrador retrievers, border col-
lies and greyhounds. In the process, they learn 
the vocabulary to label the categories.
Word study, as described in this book, 
occurs in hands-on activities that reflect basic 
cognitive learning processes: comparing and 
contrasting by categorising word features, and 
then discovering similarities and differences 
within and between categories. Word features 
include their sounds, their spelling patterns and 
their meaning. For example, by sorting words 
according to whether they end in a “silent” e, 
as Emma is doing in ­Figure  1.2, students can 
discover a consistent pattern: words ending with 
a “silent” e usually have a long vowel sound (a- - 
cake) while those without a final e have a short 
vowel sound (a˘ - cat). Under the guidance of a 
knowledgeable teacher, the logic of the spell-
ing system is revealed when students sort words 
into categories. During word study, words and 
pictures are sorted in routines that require chil-
dren to examine, discriminate and make criti-
cal judgements about speech sounds, spelling 
­patterns and meanings.
Children’s Spellings: A Window  
into Developing Word Knowledge
Students have probably been “inventing” their own spelling ever since paper and pencil 
have been available, but it was not until the early 1970s that Charles Read (1971, 1975) and 
Carol Chomsky (1971) took a serious look at young children’s spelling attempts. Their work 
introduced the world of literacy to the notion of “invented spelling”. Read understood that 
preschoolers’ attempts were not just random approximations of print. To the contrary, his 
linguistic analysis showed that children’s invented spellings provided a window into their 
developing word knowledge. These inventions revealed a systematic logic to the way some 
preschoolers selected letters to represent speech sounds.
At about the same time, Edmund Henderson and his colleagues at the University of 
Virginia had begun to look for similar logic in students’ spellings across ages and grade 
­levels (Beers & Henderson, 1977; Henderson & Beers, 1980). Read’s findings provided 
these researchers with the tools they needed to interpret the errors they were studying. 
Building on Read’s discoveries, Henderson discerned an underlying logic to students’ 
errors that changed over time, moving from the spelling of single letters and letter 
groups or patterns (Henderson, Estes & Stonecash, 1972) to the spelling of meaning 
units such as suffixes and word roots. The Virginia spelling studies corroborated and 
extended Read’s findings upwards through the grades and resulted in a comprehensive

model of ­developmental word knowledge (Henderson, 1990; Templeton & Bear, 1992; 
­Templeton & Morris, 2000).
Subsequent studies confirmed this developmental model across many groups of stu-
dents, from preschoolers (Ouellete & Sénéchal, 2008; Templeton & Spivey, 1980) through 
adults (Bear, Truex & Barone, 1989; Massengill, 2006; Worthy & Viise, 1996), as well as 
across socioeconomic levels, dialects and other alphabetic languages (Bear, Helman  & 
Woessner, 2009; Cantrell, 2001; He & Wang, 2009; Helman, 2009; Helman & Bear, 
2007; Yang, 2005). The power of this model lies in the diagnostic information contained 
in students’ spelling inventions that reveal their current understanding of written words 
(Invernizzi, Abouzeid & Gill, 1994). In addition, the analysis of students’ spelling has been 
explored independently by other researchers (e.g., Bahr, Silliman & Berninger, 2009; Bissex, 
1980; Ehri, 1992; Foorman & Petscher, 2010; Holmes & Davis, 2002; Larkin & Snowling, 
2008; Nunes & Bryant, 2009; Richgels, 1995, 2001; Treiman, 1993; Treiman, Stothard & 
Snowling, 2013; Young, 2007).
Henderson and his students not only studied the development of children’s spelling, 
but also devised an instructional model to support that development. They determined 
that through an informed analysis of students’ spelling attempts, teachers can differentiate 
and provide timely instruction in phonics, spelling and vocabulary that is essential to move 
­students forward in reading and writing. We call this efficient and effective instruction word 
study.
Why Is Word Study Important?
Becoming fully literate depends on fast, accurate recognition of words and their meanings 
in texts, and fast, accurate production of words in writing so that readers and writers can 
focus their attention on making meaning. This rapid, accurate recognition and produc-
tion depends on students’ written word knowledge—their understanding of phonics and 
spelling patterns, word parts and meanings. Planning and implementing a word study 
curriculum that explicitly teaches students necessary skills, and engages their interest and 
motivation to learn about words, is a vital aspect of any literacy programme. Indeed, how 
to teach students these basics in an effective manner has sparked controversy among educa-
tors for nearly two hundred years (Balmuth, 1992; Carnine, Silbert, Kame’enui & Tarver, 
2009; Mathews, 1967; Schlagal, 2013; Smith, 2002). But helping students learn about words 
should not be controversial.
Many phonics, spelling and vocabulary programmes are characterised by explicit skill 
instruction, a systematic scope and sequence and repeated practice. However, much of the 
repeated practice consists of drill and memorisation, so students have little opportunity to 
discover spelling patterns, manipulate word concepts or apply critical thinking skills. Although 
students need explicit skill instruction within a systematic curriculum, it is equally true that 
“teaching is not telling” (James, 1899/1958).
Students need hands-on opportunities to manipulate words and features in ways that 
allow them to generalise beyond isolated, individual examples to entire groups of words 
that are spelled the same way (Joseph, 2002; Juel & Minden-Cupp, 2000; Templeton, Smith, 
Moloney, Van Pelt & Ives, 2009; White, 2005). Excelling at word recognition, spelling and 
vocabulary is not just a matter of memorising isolated rules and definitions. The best way to 
develop fast and accurate recognition and production of words is to engage in meaningful 
reading and writing, and to have multiple opportunities to examine those same words and 
their features in and out of context. The most effective instruction in phonics, spelling and 
vocabulary links word study to the texts students are reading, provides a systematic scope and 
sequence of word features, provides multiple opportunities for hands-on practice and applica-
tion and promotes active thinking. Word study teaches students how to look at and analyse 
words so that they can construct an ever-deepening understanding of how spelling works to 
represent sound and meaning. We believe that this word study is well worth 10 to 15 ­minutes 
of instruction and practice daily (Carlisle, Kelcey & Berebitsky, 2013).

What Is the Purpose of Word Study?
The purpose of word study is twofold: it examines words in order to (1) reveal the logic and 
consistencies within our written language system and (2) help students master recognising, 
spelling, defining and using specific words. First, students develop a general knowledge of 
­English spelling. Through active exploration, word study teaches students to examine words 
to discover generalisations about English spelling, such as the role of final silent e to mark a 
long vowel sound. They learn the regularities, patterns and conventions of English orthog-
raphy needed to read and spell. This general knowledge reflects what students understand 
about the nature of our spelling system. Second, word study increases specific knowledge of 
words—the spellings and meanings of individual words.
General knowledge is what we use when we encounter a new word, when we do not know 
how to spell a word or when we do not know the meaning of a specific word. The better our 
general knowledge of the system, the better we are at decoding unfamiliar words, spelling cor-
rectly or guessing the meanings of words. For example, if you know about short vowels and 
consonants you would have no trouble attempting the word brash even if you have never seen 
or written it before. The spelling is straightforward, like so many single-syllable short vowel 
words. The general knowledge that words that are similar in spelling are related in meaning, 
such as compete and competition, makes it easier to understand the meaning of a word like com-
petitor, even if it is unfamiliar. Additional clues offered by context also increase the chances of 
reading and understanding a word correctly.
To become fully literate, however, we also need specific knowledge about individual 
words. The word rain, for example, might be spelled rane, rain or rayne; all three spellings are 
theoretically plausible. However, only specific knowledge allows us to remember the correct 
spelling. Likewise, only specific knowledge of the spelling of which and witch makes it possible 
to know which is which! The relationship between specific knowledge and general knowledge 
of the system is reciprocal—each supports the other. Conrad (2008) expressed this idea in not-
ing that “the transfer between reading and spelling occurs in both directions” (p. 876) and that 
“the orthographic representations established through practice can be used for both reading 
and spelling” (p. 869).
What Is the Basis for  
Developmental Word Study?
Word study evolves from four decades of research exploring developmental aspects of 
word knowledge with children and adults (Henderson, 1990; Henderson & Beers, 1980; 
­Templeton, 2011; Templeton & Bear, 1992). This line of research has documented the spe-
cific kinds of spelling errors that tend to occur in clusters and reflect students’ uncertainty 
over certain recurring spellings or orthographic principles. These “clusters” have been 
described in terms of (1) errors dealing with the alphabetic match of letters and sounds (FES 
for fish), (2) errors dealing with letter patterns (SNAIK for snake) and syllable patterns (POP-
ING for popping) and (3) errors dealing with words related in meaning (INVUTATION 
for invitation; a lack of knowledge that invite provides the clue to the correct spelling of the 
second vowel). The same cluster types of errors have been observed among students with 
learning disabilities and dyslexia (Bear, Negrete & Cathey, 2012; Sawyer, Lipa-Wade, Kim, 
Ritenour & Knight, 1997; Templeton & Ives, 2007; Treiman, 1985; Worthy & Invernizzi, 
1989), students who speak in variant dialects (Cantrell, 2001; Dixon, Zhao & Joshi, 2012; 
Stever, 1980; ­Treiman, Goswami, Tincoff & Leevers, 1997) and students who are learning to 
read in different alphabetic languages (Bear, Templeton, Helman & Baren, 2003; ­Helman, 
2004; Helman et  al., 2012; Yang, 2005). Longitudinal and cross-grade-level research in 
developmental spelling has shown that developmental progression occurs for all learners of 
written English in the same direction, and varies only in the rate of acquisition (Invernizzi & 
Hayes, 2004; Treiman, ­Stothard & Snowling, 2013).

Word study also builds on the history of English spelling. 
Developmental spelling researchers have examined the three lay-
ers of English orthography in the historical evolution of English 
spelling and students’ developmental progression from alphabet 
to pattern to meaning layers. Figure 1.3 illustrates how the layers 
of written English are arranged. Each of the three layers of the 
­English spelling system is built on the one before: to the straight-
forward alphabetic base of Old English was added the more 
abstract letter patterns in Middle English, and to that layer were 
added the Greek and Latin meaning units such as prefixes, suffixes 
and roots in early Modern English. For mature readers, upper 
level word study examines interactions among the three layers.
Alphabet
Our spelling system is alphabetic because it represents the rela-
tionship between letters and sounds. In the word sat, each sound 
is represented by a single letter; we blend the sounds for s, a and t to read the word sat. In the 
word chin, we still hear three sounds, even though there are four letters, because the first two 
letters, ch, function like a single letter, representing a single sound. So we can match ­letters—
sometimes singly, sometimes in pairs—to sounds from left to right and create words. This 
alphabetic layer in English spelling is the first layer of information at work.
The alphabetic layer of English orthography was established during the time of Old Eng-
lish, the language spoken and written by the Anglo-Saxons in England between the Germanic 
invasions of the sixth century b.c.e. and the conquest of England by William of Normandy in 
1066 (Lerer, 2007). Old English was remarkably consistent in letter–sound correspondence and 
used the alphabet to systematically represent speech sounds. The long vowels were pronounced 
close to the way they are in modern Romance languages today, such as Spanish, French and 
Italian (i.e. E is pronounced as long A as in tres and I is pronounced as long E as in Rio).
The history of the alphabetic layer reflected in the story of Old English is relevant to 
teachers today because beginners spell like “little Saxons” as they begin to read and write 
(Henderson, 1981). Armed with only a rudimentary knowledge of the alphabet and letter 
sounds, beginning spellers of all backgrounds use their alphabet knowledge quite literally. 
They rely on the sound embedded in the names of the letters to represent the sounds they are 
trying to represent (Invernizzi, 1992; Read, 1971; Young, 2007). This strategy works quite well 
for consonants when the names do, in fact, contain the correct corresponding speech sounds 
(Bee, Dee, eF, eS and so forth). It works less well for letters that have more than one sound 
(C: /s/ and /k/  ), and it does not work at all for consonants with names that do not contain their 
corresponding speech sounds (W: double you; Y: wie; and H: aitch). Short vowel sounds are par-
ticularly problematic for novice spellers because there is no single letter that “says” the short 
vowel sound. As a result, beginning readers choose a letter whose name, when pronounced, 
sounds and feels closest to the targeted short vowel sound (Beers & Henderson, 1977; Read, 
1975). For example, beginning readers often spell the short e sound in bed with the letter a 
(BAD) and the short i sound in rip with the letter e (REP).
Pattern
Why don’t we spell all words in English “the way they sound”—at the alphabetic level, in 
other words? If we did, words like cape, bead and light would look like cap, bed and lit—but 
these spellings, of course, already represent other words. Therefore, the pattern layer overlies 
the alphabetic layer. Because there are 42 to 44 sounds in English and only 26 letters in the 
alphabet, single sounds are sometimes spelled with more than one letter or are affected by 
other letters that do not stand for any sounds themselves. When we look beyond single ­letter–
sound match-ups and search for patterns that guide the groupings of letters, however, we find 
surprising consistency (Hanna, Hanna, Hodges & Rudorf, 1966; Venezky, 1999).

Take, for example, the ain in rain: we say that the silent i is a vowel marker, indicating that 
the preceding vowel letter, a, stands for a long vowel sound. The i does not stand for a sound 
itself, but marks the vowel before it as long. The ai group of letters follows a pattern: when you 
have a pair of vowels in a single syllable, this letter grouping forms a pattern that often indicates 
a long vowel. We refer to this as the “AI pattern” or as the consonant-vowel-vowel-consonant 
(CVVC) pattern—one of several high-frequency long-vowel patterns. Overall, knowledge 
about orthographic patterns within words is considerably valuable to students in both their 
reading and their spelling.
Where did these patterns originate? The simple letter–sound consistency of Old ­English 
was overlaid by a massive influx of French words after the Norman Conquest in 1066. Because 
these words entered the existing language through bilingual Anglo-Norman ­speakers and 
writers, some of the French pronunciations and spelling conventions were adopted, too. Old 
English was thus overlaid with the vocabulary and spelling traditions of the ruling class, the 
Norman French. This complex interaction of pronunciation change on top of the inter-
mingling of French and English spellings led to a proliferation of different vowel sounds 
represented by different vowel patterns. The extensive repertoire of vowel patterns today is 
attributable to this period of history, such as the various pronunciations of the ea pattern in 
words like bread and thread, great and break, meat and clean. It is uncanny that students in this 
pattern stage of spelling spell like “little Anglo-Normans” when they write taste as TAIST or 
leave as LEEVE.
Meaning
The third layer of English orthography is the meaning layer. When students learn that 
groups of letters can represent meaning directly, they will be much less puzzled when encoun-
tering unusual spellings. Examples of these units or groups of letters are prefixes, suffixes and 
Greek and Latin roots. These units of meaning are called morphemes—the smallest units of 
meaning in a language.
One example of how meaning functions in the spelling system is the prefix re-: Whether 
we hear it pronounced “ree” as in rethink or “ruh” as in remove, the morpheme spelling stays 
the same because it directly represents meaning. Why is sign spelled with a silent g? Because 
it is related in meaning to signature, in which the g is pronounced. The letters s-i-g-n remain 
in both words to visually preserve the meaning relationships that these words share. Likewise, 
the letter sequence photo in photograph, photographer and photographic signals spelling–meaning 
connections among these words, despite the changes in sounds that the letter o represents.
The explosion of knowledge and culture during the Renaissance required a new, expanded 
vocabulary to accommodate the growth in learning that occurred during this time. Greek 
and Latin were used by educated people throughout Europe and classical roots had the 
potential to meet this demand for meaning. Greek roots could be combined (e.g., autograph 
and ­autobiography), and prefixes and suffixes were added to Latin roots (inspect, spectator and 
­spectacular). So, to the orthographic record of English history was added a third layer of mean-
ing that built new vocabulary out of elements that came from classical Greek and Latin.
The spelling–meaning relations inherent in words brought into English during the 
Renaissance have important implications for vocabulary instruction today as students move 
through the intermediate grades and beyond (Templeton 2011/2012, 2012). When students 
explore how spelling visually preserves meaning relationships among words with the same 
derivations (e.g., note the second b in bomb and bombard ), they see how closely related ­spelling 
is to meaning and vocabulary. The seemingly arbitrary spelling of some words—in which 
silent letters occur or vowel spellings seem irrational—is in reality central to understanding 
the meanings of related words. For example, the silent c in muscle is “sounded” in the related 
words muscular and musculature—all of which come from the Latin musculus, literally a little 
mouse (the rippling of a muscle reminded the Romans of the movements of a mouse!). Such 
words, through their spellings, carry their history and meaning with them (Venezky, 1999; 
Templeton et al., 2015).

Learning the Layers of English Orthography
Organising the phonics, spelling and vocabulary curriculum according to historical layers of 
alphabet, pattern and meaning provides a systematic guide for instruction. It places the types 
of words to be studied in an evolutionary progression that mirrors the development of the 
orthographic system itself. Anglo-Saxon words, the oldest words in English, are among the 
easiest to read and the most familiar. Words like sun, moon, day and night are high-frequency 
“earthy” words that populate easy reading materials in the primary grades. Anglo-Saxon words 
survive in high-frequency prepositions, pronouns, conjunctions and auxiliary verbs (e.g., 
have, was, does) although the pronunciation is now quite different. More difficult ­Norman 
French words of one and two syllables—words like chance, chamber, royal, guard and conquer—­
frequently appear in books suitable for the elementary grades. The less frequent, more aca-
demic vocabulary of English—words like calculate, maximum, cumulus, nucleus, hemisphere, 
hydraulic and rhombus—are Latin and Greek in origin and appear most often in student read-
ing selections in the upper elementary grades and beyond.
Alphabet, pattern and meaning represent three broad principles of written English 
and form the layered record of orthographic history. As students learn to read and write, 
they appear to reinvent the system as it was itself invented. As shown in Figure 1.4, begin-
ners invent the spellings of simple words phonetically, just as the Anglo-Saxons did over a 
­thousand years ago. As students become independent readers, they add a second layer by 
using patterns, much as the Norman French did. Notice in Figure 1.4 the overuse of the 
silent e vowel marker at the ends of all of Antonie’s words, much like Geoffrey Chaucer’s! 
Intermediate and advanced readers invent conventions for joining syllables and units of 
meaning, as was done during the Renaissance when English incorporated a large classical 
Greek and Latin vocabulary (­Henderson, 1990; ­Templeton, Bear, Invernizzi & Johnston, 
2010). As ­Figure  1.4 shows, both Julian, 
age 14, and Queen Elizabeth I in 1600 had 
to deal with issues of consonant doubling in 
the middle of words.
In this book, we argue that ortho-
graphic knowledge—understanding the 
ways in which letters and letter patterns in 
words represent sound and meaning—plays 
a central role in a comprehensive language 
arts programme that links reading and writ-
ing. Word knowledge accumulates as stu-
dents develop orthographic understandings 
at the alphabetic, pattern and meaning lev-
els. This happens when they read and write 
purposefully and are also provided with 
explicit, systematic word study instruction 
by knowledgeable teachers. Word study 
should give students the experiences they 
need to ­progress through and integrate 
these layers of information.
• For students who are experiment-
ing with the alphabetic match of let-
ters and sounds, teachers can contrast 
aspects of the writing system that relate 
directly to the representation of sound. 
For example, words spelled with short 
e (bed, leg, net, neck, mess) are compared 
with words spelled with short o (hot, 
rock, top, log, pond ).

• For students experimenting with pattern, teachers can contrast patterns as they relate to 
vowels. For example, words spelled with ay ( play, day, tray, way) are compared to words 
spelled with ai (wait, rain, chain, maid ).
• For students experimenting with conventions of syllables, affixes (prefixes and suffixes), 
and other meaning units, teachers can help students see that words with similar meanings 
are often spelled the same, despite changes in pronunciation. For example, admiration is 
spelled with an i in the second syllable because it comes from the word admire.
Throughout this text, the foundational skills found in the CCSS and most state core stan-
dards are addressed explicitly. The vocabulary standards may be found in the language 
sections of state standards and at the upper levels include a focus on academic vocabulary 
instruction.
The Development of Orthographic  
Knowledge
When we say word study is developmental, we mean that the study of specific word 
features must match the level of the learner’s word knowledge. Word study is not a one-
size-fits-all programme of instruction that begins in the same place for all students within 
a grade level. One unique quality of word study, as we describe it, lies in the critical role 
of differentiating instruction for different levels of word knowledge. Though particular 
sources of ­information may predominate at different stages—for example, alphabetic for 
beginning spellers and readers, syllabic and morphemic for more skilled and proficient read-
ers and ­spellers—there may also be subtle influences of or interaction with other sources 
of information (Templeton, 2003). For example, beginning readers and spellers may read 
and spell certain morphemes such as -ed, -ing and un- correctly, but instruction will focus 
primarily on developing their understanding of alphabetic, and later, pattern correspon-
dences in spelling. More focused instruction involving morphemes and their spelling will 
occur at later stages.
Knowledgeable educators have come to know that word study instruction must match 
the needs of the child. This construct, called instructional level, is a powerful determinant 
of what may be learned. Simply put, we must teach within each child’s zone of understand-
ing (Harré & Moghaddam, 2003; Vygotsky, 1962). To do otherwise results in frustration or 
boredom and little learning in either case. Just as in learning to play the piano—when students 
must work through book A, then book B and then book C—learning to read and spell is a 
gradual and cumulative process. Word study begins with finding out what each child already 
knows and starting instruction there.
One of the easiest and most informative ways to know what students need to learn is to 
look at the way they spell words. Students’ efforts to spell provide a direct window into how 
they think the spelling system works. By interpreting what students do, educators can target a 
specific student’s instructional level and plan word study instruction that this student is ready 
to learn. Furthermore, by applying basic principles of child development, educators have 
learned how to engage students in learning about word features in a child-centred, develop-
mentally appropriate way.
When students are instructed within their own zone of understanding or zone of 
­proximal development (ZPD)—studying words their way—they are able to build on what 
they already know, to learn what they need to know next and to move forward. Zone of 
proximal development was first described by Vygotsky (1962): the “zone” refers to the span 
between what a learner knows and is able to do independently, and what she is able to do with 
support and guidance. With explicit instruction and ample experience reading, writing and 
examining words, spelling features that were previously omitted or confused become incor-
porated into an ever-increasing reading and writing vocabulary.

Stages of Spelling Development
As we have described, students move from easier one-to-
one correspondences between letters and sounds, to more 
difficult, abstract relationships between letter patterns and 
sounds, to even more sophisticated relationships between 
meaning units as they relate to sound and pattern. Develop-
mental spelling research describes this growth as a continuum 
or a series of chronologically ordered stages or phases of word 
knowledge (Ehri, 2005; Nunes & Bryant, 2009; Steffler, 2001; 
­Templeton, 2011). In this book, we use the word stage as a 
metaphor to inform instruction. In reality, as students grow in 
conceptual knowledge of the three layers of information about 
English and of specific word features, there is some overlap 
in the layers and features students understand and use. In 
fact, as students grow in their understanding of how spelling 
represents both sound and meaning, they also become more 
flexible in their application of spelling strategies and they are 
able to do more than just “sound it out”. They may be able 
to use analogies to other words with similar sounds, patterns, 
or meanings or use spelling–meaning connections to figure 
it out. There is a range of grades during which students pass 
through these stages, as described in Figure 1.5. You may find 
that state foundational core standards indicate performance 
standards suggesting earlier acquisition of the skills and 
understandings represented by each of these stages.
Stages are marked by broad, qualitative shifts in the types 
of spelling errors students make as well as changes in the way 
they read words. It is not the case that students abandon sound 
once they move to the use of patterns, or abandon patterns 
once they move to the use of meaning units or morphology. 
Rather, the names of the stages capture the key understandings 
that distinguish them among the layers of English orthography and among the levels of students’ 
general knowledge of the orthography (Bryant, Nunes & Bindman, 1997; Ehri, 1997, 2006; 
Templeton, 2002, 2003). Over the years, the labels used to describe the five stages of spelling 
development have changed somewhat to reflect what research has revealed about the nature of 
developmental word knowledge, and to represent most appropriately what occurs at each level.
Because word study is based on students’ level of orthographic knowledge, the word study 
activities presented in this book are arranged by stages of spelling. Knowing each student’s 
stage of spelling determines appropriate word study activities. This chapter presents a brief 
overview of these stages. As illustrated in Figure 1.5, the Chapters 4 through 8 explore each of 
these stages in depth. By conducting assessments throughout the year, as described in Chapter 
2, teachers can determine the spelling stages of their students and track students’ progress 
and development. An important prerequisite to instruction and assessment is knowing the 
continuum of orthographic development.
For each stage, students’ orthographic knowledge is defined by three functional levels 
that are useful guides for knowing when to teach what (Invernizzi et al., 1994):
1.	 What students do correctly—an independent or easy level
2.	 What students “use but confuse”—an instructional level or zone of proximal development 
at which instruction is most helpful
3.	 What is absent in students’ spelling—a frustration level in which spelling concepts are 
too difficult
In Vygotskian terms (1962), we focus on each student’s zone of proximal development by 
determining what students use but confuse. This is where instruction most benefits the student.

C HAP TER 1
Emergent Stage
The emergent stage encompasses the writing efforts of children who are not yet read-
ing conventionally and in most cases have not been exposed to formal reading instruction. 
Emergent writers typically range in age from 2 to 5 years, although anyone not yet reading 
conventionally is in this stage of development. Emergent writing may range from random 
marks to legitimate letters that bear a relationship to sound. However, most of the emergent 
stage is decidedly prephonetic, which means there is little if any direct relationship between 
a character on the page and an individual speech sound.
As we explore in Chapter 4, emergent writing may be divided into a series of steps 
or landmarks. Children move from producing large scribbles undecipherable from the 
­drawing (as illustrated in Figure 1.6A, Haley’s picture of birdies), to using something that 
looks like scribbles separate from the picture (see Figure 1.6B where the child labelled his 
drawing to the left as “cowboy”), and on to using letters to represent some sounds in words 
(Figure 1.6C where Jasmin has been written as JMOE). In between, emergent learners are 
­learning and experimenting with various symbols such as numbers and letter like forms 
(Cabell, ­Tortorelli & Gerde, 2013). Moving from this stage to the next stage hinges on learn-
ing the alphabetic principle: letters represent sounds in a systematic way, and words can be 
­segmented into sequences of sound from left to right.
Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage
The letter name–alphabetic spelling stage encompasses 
that period during which students are first formally taught to 
read, typically during ­kindergarten and early first grade. Most 
letter name–alphabetic spellers are between the ages of 4 and 
7 years, although a beginning reader at age 55 also can be a 
letter name–alphabetic speller (Bear, 1989; Massengill, 2006; 
Viise, 1996). Early in this stage, “letter name” is students’ 
dominant approach to spelling; that is, they use the names of 
the letters as cues to the sounds they want to represent (Read, 
1975). In Ellie’s early letter name–alphabetic spelling shown 
in Figure 1.7, she wrote YNRUKM: she used the letter Y to 
represent the /w/ sound at the beginning of the word when, 
because the first sound in the pronounced letter name Y (“wie”) 
matches the first sound in the word when. The letter name for 
N includes the “en” sound to ­finish off the word when. Ellie 
used R and U to represent the entire words are and you, another 
early letter name strategy.

Developmental Word ­Knowledge	
37
As students move through this stage, they learn to segment 
the individual speech sound or phonemes within words and to 
match an appropriate letter or ­letter pairs to those sounds. Stu-
dents in the later part of the letter name–­alphabetic stage spell 
much like the ­sample in ­Figure 1.8. Kaitlyn shows mastery of 
most ­beginning and ending consonants. She spells many high-
frequency words correctly, such as will, love, have and you. What 
clearly separates her from Ellie’s early letter name spelling is her 
consistent use of vowels. Long vowels, which “say their name,” 
appear in TIM for time and HOP for hope, but silent letters are 
not represented. Short vowels are used but confused, as in miss 
spelled as MES and much as MICH.
Within Word Pattern Stage
Students entering the within word pattern spelling stage can 
read and spell many words correctly because of their automatic 
knowledge of letter sounds and short-vowel patterns. This level 
of orthographic knowledge typically begins as students transition to independent reading 
towards the end of first grade. It expands for most students throughout second and third grade 
and into fourth. Although most within word pattern spellers typically range in age from 6 to 
9 years, many low-skilled adult readers remain in this stage. Regardless, this period of ortho-
graphic development lasts longer than the letter name–alphabetic stage, because the vowel 
pattern system of English orthography is quite extensive.
The within word pattern stage begins when students move away from the linear, sound-
by-sound approach of the letter name–alphabetic spellers and begin to include patterns or 
chunks of letter sequences and silent vowel markers like final e. Within word pattern spellers 
can think about words in more than one dimension; they study words by sound and pattern 
simultaneously. As the name of this stage suggests, within word pattern spellers take a closer 
look at vowel patterns within single-syllable words (Henderson, 1990).
Kim’s writing in Figure 1.9 is that of an early within word pattern speller. She spells many 
short-vowel and high-frequency words correctly, such as hill, had, them, girl and won. She also 
spells some common long-vowel patterns correctly in CVCe words like time and game. Kim 
hears the long vowel sound in words like team, goal and throw, but she selects incorrect pat-
terns, spelling them as TEME, GOWL and THROWE and she omits the silent e in cones. 
These are good examples of how Kim is using but confusing long-vowel patterns.
During the within word pattern stage, students first study the common long-vowel pat-
terns (long o can be spelled with o-consonant-e as in joke, oa as in goal and ow as in throw) 
and then less common patterns such as the VCC pattern in cold and most. The most difficult 
patterns are ambiguous vowels because the sound is nei-
ther long nor short and the same pattern may represent 
different sounds, such as the ou in mouth, cough, through 
and tough. These less common and ambiguous vowels may 
persist as misspellings into the late within word pattern 
stage.
Although the focus of the within word pattern stage 
is on the pattern layer of English orthography, students 
must also consider the meaning layer to spell and use 
homophones, words such as bear and bare, deer and dear 
and hire and higher. These words sound the same but have 
different spellings and meanings. Because of this, sound, 
pattern and meaning must be considered when spelling. 
Homophones introduce the spelling–meaning connection 
that is explored further in the next two stages of spelling 
development.

Syllables and Affixes Stage
The syllables and affixes stage is typically achieved in middle to upper elementary school, 
when students are expected to spell many words of more than one syllable. This represents a 
new point in word study when students consider spelling patterns where syllables meet, and 
meaning units such as affixes (prefixes and suffixes). Students in this fourth stage are most 
often between 8 and 12 years old, though many adults can also be found in this stage.
In Figure 1.10, a fourth-grader in the early part of the syllables and affixes stage has 
written about his summer vacation. Xavier spelled most one-syllable short and long vowel 
words correctly (went, west, drove, last). Many of his errors are in two-syllable words and 
fall at the places where syllables and affixes meet. Xavier does not know the conventions 
for preserving vowel sounds when adding affixes such as -ed and -ing. He spelled stopped as 
STOPED and hiking as HIKEING. The principle of doubling the consonant to keep the 
vowel short is used in LITTEL for little, but is lacking in his spelling of summer as SUMER. 
Final syllables often give students difficulty because the vowel sound is not clear and may be 
spelled different ways, as shown in Xavier’s spellings of LITTEL for little and MOUNTINS 
for mountains.
Towards the end of the syllables and affixes 
stage, students explore the spelling of affixes 
that affect the meanings of words—for example, 
DESLOYAL for disloyal and CAREFULL for 
careful. Though studying simple affixes and base 
words as a decoding strategy begins earlier, study-
ing base words and affixes more closely at this 
stage helps students construct the foundation for 
further exploration of word meanings in the next 
stage, derivational relations. At that stage, students 
study the spelling–meaning connections of related 
words (Templeton, 2004). By studying base words 
and derivational affixes, students learn more about 
English spelling as they enrich their vocabularies.
Derivational Relations Stage
The derivational relations spelling stage is the final stage in the developmental model. 
Some students move into the derivational stage as early as grade 4 or 5, but most derivational 
relations spellers are found in middle school, high school and college. This stage continues 
throughout adulthood, when individuals continue to read and write according to their inter-
ests and specialties. This stage of orthographic knowledge is known as derivational relations 
because this is when students examine how many words may be derived from base words and 
word roots. Students discover that the meanings and spellings of meaningful word parts or 
morphemes remain constant across different but derivationally related words (Henderson & 
Templeton, 1986; Henry, 1988; Nunes & Bryant, 2009; Schlagal, 2013; Templeton, 2004). 
Word study in this stage builds on and expands knowledge of a wide vocabulary, including 
thousands of words of Greek and Latin origin. We refer to this study as generative because 
as students explore and learn about the word formation processes of English they are able 
to generate knowledge of literally thousands of words (Graves, 1986; Harris, Schumaker & 
Deshler, 2011; Kirk & Gillon, 2009; Nunes & Bryant, 2006; Templeton, 2012; Templeton 
et al., 2015).
Early derivational relations spellers like sixth-grader Kaitlyn (Figure 1.11) spell most 
words correctly. However, some of her errors reflect a lack of knowledge about derivations. 
For example, favourite spelled FAVERITE and ­different spelled DIFFRENT do not reflect 
their relationship to favour and differ. Her errors on final suffixes such as the -sion in division 
and the  -ent in ingredients are also very typical of students in this stage.

The logic inherent in this lifelong 
stage can be summed up as follows: 
words that are related in meaning are 
often related in spelling as well, despite 
changes in sound (Templeton, 1979, 
1983, 2004). Spelling–meaning connec-
tions provide a powerful way of expand-
ing vocabulary.
The Synchrony 
of Literacy 
Development
The scope and sequence of word study 
instruction we present in Chapters 4 
through 8 is based on research describing 
the developmental relationship between 
spelling and reading behaviours. When 
teachers conduct word study with students, they address learning needs in all areas of literacy 
because development in one area relates to development in other areas. This harmony in the 
timing of development has been described as the synchrony of reading, writing and spelling 
development (Bear, 1991b; Bear & Templeton, 1998). All three advance in stage like pro-
gressions that share important conceptual dimensions. Figure 1.12 illustrates the synchrony 
among reading, writing and spelling, and presents key examples in the following discussion of 
each reading stage.
Individuals may vary in their rate of progress through these stages, but most tend to 
follow the same order of development. The observed synchrony makes it possible to bring 
together reading, writing and spelling behaviours to assess and plan differentiated instruction 
that matches students’ developmental pace. The following discussion centres on this overall 
progression, with an emphasis on the synchronous behaviours of reading and writing with 
spelling.
Emergent Readers
During the emergent stage, children may undertake reading and writing in earnest, but adults 
will recognise their efforts as more pretend than real. These students may “read” familiar 
books from memory using the pictures on each page to cue their recitation of the text. Chall 
(1983) called this stage of development prereading because students are not reading in a con-
ventional sense. Emergent readers may call out the name of a favourite fast food restaurant 
when they recognise its logo, but they are not systematic in their use of any particular cue.
During the emergent stage, children lack an understanding of the alphabetic principle or 
show only the beginning of this understanding as they start to learn some letters. Emergent 
learners gradually acquire directionality as they try to fingerpoint read, and in their writing. 
By the end of this stage, emergent learners will have learned many letters of the alphabet and 
they may even include a few letters to represent sounds when they write.
Beginning Readers
Understanding the alphabetic nature of our language is a major hurdle for ­readers and spell-
ers. The child who writes light as LT has made a quantum conceptual leap, having grasped

that there are systematic matches between sounds and letters that must be made when writing. 
Early letter name–alphabetic spellers have moved from pretend reading to the beginning of 
real reading, as they start to use systematic letter–sound matches to identify and store words 
in memory. Beginning reading is achieved when students have a concept of word in text, 
which is demonstrated by a child’s ability to point accurately to a few lines of familiar text—a 
demonstration of the one-to-one correspondence between what they read and say (Clay, 1979; 
Morris, Bloodgood, Lomax & Perney, 2003; Uhry, 1999).
Just as early attempts to spell words are partial, beginning readers initially have limited 
knowledge of letter sounds as they try to identify words by using the letter sounds they do 
know. The kinds of reading errors students make during this phase offer insights into what 
they understand about print. Using context as well as partial consonant cues, a child reading 
about good things to eat might substitute sweet or even biscuit for cake in the sentence, “The 
cake was good.” Readers in this stage require support in the form of predictable, memorable 
texts or books that limit the number and nature of words.
The reading by letter name–alphabetic spellers is often disfluent—that is, choppy and 
often word-by-word, unless they have read the passage before or are otherwise familiar with 
it (Bear, 1992). If you ask such spellers to read silently, the best they can do is to whisper. They 
need to read aloud to vocalise the letter sounds and usually fingerpoint as they read. Chall 
(1983) described children as being “glued to print” during this stage as they plod along slowly 
reading words, sometimes letter-by-letter, sound-by-sound.
Transitional Readers
During the transitional stage, students’ reading becomes fluent because it is supported 
by a store of words that can be identified automatically “at first sight”. These tend to be 
words they have read over and over again in meaningful contexts and words with frequently 
occurring letter patterns such as the consonant-vowel-consonant (CVC) pattern for short-
vowel words. However, they “use but confuse” the various long-vowel patterns of English 
(Invernizzi, 1992).
During this stage, students integrate the knowledge and skills acquired in the previous 
two stages and they become more flexible in thinking about sound, pattern and meaning. 
Advances in word knowledge affect students’ writing, too. Their sizable sight word vocabu-
lary allows them to write more quickly and with greater detail. Writing and reading speeds 
increase significantly from the beginning letter name–alphabetic stage to the transitional 
within word pattern stage, and over the course of this stage, oral reading is gradually replaced 
by silent reading as the preferred mode (Bear, 1992; Ehri, 2014; Invernizzi, 1992).
Intermediate and Advanced Readers
The stages of word knowledge that characterise intermediate and advanced readers include 
syllables and affixes and derivational relations, as shown in Figure 1.12. Students in these stages 
have relatively automatic word recognition, leaving their minds free to think as rapidly as 
they can read. Intermediate students read most texts with good accuracy and speed, both 
orally and silently. Students learn to become flexible, strategic readers and ultimately become 
proficient adult readers (Spear-Swerling & Sternberg, 1997). Reading becomes an ever-more 
dominant mode of learning information and concepts. Intermediate and advanced readers 
are usually fluent writers. The content of their writing often displays complex analysis and 
interpretation, reflecting a more sophisticated, discipline-specific vocabulary. The degree to 
which they write at this level often depends on the quality of the writing instruction they 
receive.
Vocabulary and word use play a central role in the connections that intermediate and 
advanced readers forge between reading and writing. From adolescence on, most of the new 
vocabulary students learn—except perhaps for slang—comes from reading, and reflects new 
domains of content-specific knowledge that students explore (Beck, McKeown & Kucan, 

	 42	
C HAP TER 1
2002; Zwiers, 2008). Studying ­spelling–meaning connections is central to maximising this 
vocabulary growth (Nunes & Bryant, 2006; Templeton, 2004).
Chapter 2 will help you identify your students by the stages of reading, writing and spell-
ing. You will then know which chapters contain the activities that are most relevant to their 
development, as shown in Figure 1.5 on page 35.
Teachers often return to Figure 1.13 to examine the integrated model of how read-
ing, writing and spelling progress in synchrony. In parent–teacher conferences, teachers 
often refer to Figure 1.13 when they discuss a student’s development. They explain to 
the parent how the child’s spelling level corresponds to the characteristics of her read-
ing level, as well as the types of writing we may expect from a child at that particular 
developmental level.
Words Their Way
Students acquire word knowledge implicitly as they read and write, and explicitly through 
instruction orchestrated by the teacher. An informed interpretation of students’ reading and 
writing attempts shows us which words they can read and spell, and of those, which they might 
learn more about. There is more to pacing instruction than plugging students into a sequence 
of phonics or spelling features. Instructional pacing must be synonymous with instructional 
placing. That is, we must fit our instruction to what our students are using but confusing. How 
do we know what they are using but confusing? A good deal of what students understand 
about orthography is revealed in their uncorrected writing. Using the spelling inventories 
described in the next chapter as a guide, you will be able to place students and pace the content 
of word study.
Figure 1.13 illustrates the theory of developmental word knowledge and shows how word 
study links reading and writing. To help students explore and learn about words their way, 
instruction must be sensitive to two fundamental tenets:
1.	 Students’ learning of phonics, spelling and vocabulary is based on their developmental or 
instructional level.
2.	 Students’ learning is based on the way they are naturally inclined to learn—through com-
paring and contrasting word features and discovering consistencies.
When these two tenets are honoured, students learn their way—building from what is known 
about words to what is new. Rather than rote memorisation activities designed only to ensure 
repeated mechanical practice, word study encourages explo-
ration and examination of word features that are within a 
student’s stage of literacy development. Word study is active, 
and by making judgements about words and sorting words 
according to similar features, students construct their own 
understandings about how the features work. Engaging 
instruction and thoughtful practice helps students internalise 
word features and become automatic in using what they have 
learned.
To foreshadow the word study instruction to come in 
this book, Figure 1.14 summarises the characteristics of 
each spelling stage, the reading and writing context and the 
word study instruction that is appropriate for each stage. 
After learning in Chapter 2 how to assess the developmental 
word knowledge of your students, the remaining chapters 
offer more detail about planning word study instruction for 
each stage of development. Figure 1.14 can be a reference 
as you learn more about the developmental stages discussed 
in Chapters 4 to 7 and later to check for the integration of 
reading, word study and writing.

The Assessment of  
Orthographic Development

I
n the chapter’s opening image, you see four second-grade teachers who have just com-
pleted a spelling assessment. They review the data as a team and develop instructional 
goals and plans for word study in their classrooms. They see how children have pro-
gressed and what specific types of word study they want to plan for students in each of their 
three or four groups.
These teachers know that effective teaching cannot begin until you understand what stu-
dents already know about words and what they are ready to learn. Likewise, you cannot make 
instructional adjustments until you evaluate the results of your teaching. This chapter presents 
an informal assessment process that will enable you to:
	 1.	 Informally observe and interpret orthographic knowledge in writing and reading.
	 2.	 Select and administer a qualitative spelling inventory.
	 3.	 Score and analyse the spelling inventory and identify specific features students need to 
study.
	 4.	 Determine students’ developmental stage of word knowledge or instructional level.
	 5.	 Group students for differentiated instruction.
	 6.	 Use supplemental assessments for a wide array of instructional needs.
	 7.	 Set goals and monitor students’ growth in orthographic knowledge over time.
	 8.	 Interpret the orthographic knowledge of your English learners.
Informal Observations to Assess  
Orthographic Knowledge
There is synchrony in the development of reading, writing and spelling, and informally 
observing students’ literacy behaviours provides rich information for planning instruction. 
Using strategies for reading and writing is related to students’ increased levels of orthographic 
knowledge (Sharp et al., 2008). Because of these interactions, we look to what students do as 
they write and read.
Observe and Interpret Students’ Writing
Teachers observe students daily as they write for various purposes. These observations help 
reveal what students understand about words. The following example demonstrates what you 
might learn about a kindergartner’s literacy development. Sarah called this her “first restau-
rant review.” Although it appears to be a menu, she posted it on the wall the way she had seen 
reviews posted in restaurants.
What Sarah Wrote
How Sarah Read What She Wrote
1.	CRS KAM SAS
First course, clam sauce
2.	CRS FESH
Second course, fish
3.	CRS SAGATE
Third course, spaghetti
4.	CRS POSH POPS
Fourth course, Push Pops
This writing tells a lot about Sarah: she sees a practical use for writing and she enjoys 
displaying her work. She has a good grasp of how to compose a list and she is even begin-
ning to understand menu planning! When we look for what Sarah knows about spelling, 
we see that she represents many consonant sounds and some digraphs (the /sh/ in fish and 
push), but blends are incomplete (using K in KAM for the cl in clam). She has placed a vowel 
in all but one syllable; however, in spelling fish as FESH, Sarah confuses e and i. In the word 
course, spelled as CRS, the letter r represents the /r/ and the vowel sound. According to 

	 48	
C HAP TER 2
the sequence of development presented in Chapter 1, Sarah 
is considered a letter name–alphabetic speller who would 
benefit from instruction emphasising short vowel sounds 
and the spelling of blends.
In Figure 2.1, we see a writing sample from Jake, an 
older student. The writing is readable because many words 
are spelled correctly and the others are close approxima-
tions. When we look for what Jake knows, we see that 
he has mastered most consonant relationships—even the 
three-letter blend in SCRAPPED—but not the complex tch 
unit in STICHES. Most long and short vowels are spelled 
correctly, as in had, have, went, cone, home and day. When 
we look for what Jake uses but confuses, we see that he 
confuses the -ck and -ke ending in SHACKING for shaking. 
He inserts an unnecessary extra vowel when he spells chin 
as CHIAN but omits some silent vowel markers where they 
are needed, as with CREM for cream. Based on the vowel 
errors, Jake is considered a within word pattern speller who 
would benefit from the study of vowel patterns. We will take 
another look at Jake’s word knowledge when we examine his spelling inventory later in this 
chapter.
Student writings, especially unedited rough drafts, are a gold mine of information about 
their orthographic knowledge. Many teachers keep a variety of student writing samples 
to document students’ needs and growth over time. The Qualitative Spelling Checklist in 
Appendix A, and on the PDToolkit, provides a systematic way to analyse your students’ writing 
samples for specific orthographic features.
Relying entirely on writing samples has drawbacks, however. Some students are anx-
ious about the accuracy of their spelling and will only use words they know how to spell. 
Others will get help from resources in the room, such as word walls, dictionaries and the 
person sitting nearby, and thus their writing may overestimate what they really know. On 
the other hand, when students concentrate on getting their ideas on paper, they may not 
pay attention to spelling and make excessive errors. Some students write freely with little 
concern about accuracy and need to be reminded to use what they know. Daily observations 
will help you to determine not only student’s orthographic knowledge but also their habits 
and dispositions.
Observe Students’ Reading
Important insights into orthographic knowledge can also be made when we observe students’ 
reading. Reading and spelling are related but not mirror images because the processes differ 
slightly. In reading, words can be recognised with many types of textual supports, so the ability 
to read words correctly lies a little ahead of students’ spelling accuracy (Bear & Templeton, 
2000; Templeton & Bear, 2011). For example, within word pattern spellers, who are also tran-
sitional readers, read many two-syllable words like shopping and bottle correctly but may spell 
those same words as SHOPING and BOTEL.
Spelling is a conservative measure of what students know about words in general, so if 
students can spell a word, then we know they can read the word. It seldom works the other way 
around except in the emergent and early letter name stages, in which students might generate 
spellings they don’t know how to read (Invernizzi & Hayes, 2010; Rayner, Foorman, Perfetti, 
Pesetsky & Seidenburg, 2001). When students consult reference materials such as a spell 
checker or dictionary, the spelling task becomes a reading task; we all know the phenomenon 
of being able to recognise the correct spelling if we just see it.
Like spelling errors, reading errors show us what students are using but confusing when 
they read, and certain errors can be expected of students in different stages. Teachers who

understand students’ developmental word knowledge will be in a good position to interpret 
students’ reading errors and to make decisions about the appropriate prompt to use in reading 
with students (Brown, 2003). A student who substitutes bunny for rabbit in the sentence “The 
farmer saw a rabbit” is probably a beginning reader and an early letter name–alphabetic speller. 
The student uses the picture rather than knowledge about sound–symbol correspondences to 
generate a logical response. For students in this partial alphabetic phase (Ehri, 2014), draw-
ing attention to the beginning sound can teach them to use their consonant knowledge. The 
teacher might point to the first letter and say, “Can that word be bunny? It starts with an r. 
What would start with rrrrr?”
Later in development, assessments of oral reading substitutions show a different level 
of word knowledge. A transitional reader who substitutes growled for groaned in “Jason 
groaned when he missed the ball” is probably attending to several orthographic features of 
the word. The student appears to use the initial blend gr, the vowel o and the -ed ending to 
come up with an approximation that fits the meaning of the sentence. Because this student 
has vowel knowledge, a teacher might direct the student’s attention to the oa pattern and 
ask him to try it again.
Our response to reading errors and our expectations for correcting such errors depend on 
a number of factors, one of which is knowing where students are developmentally. For exam-
ple, it is inappropriate to ask students in the early letter name–alphabetic stage to sound out 
the word flat or even to look for a familiar part within the word in the hope that they might 
use their knowledge of -at words by analogy. Emergent and early letter name–alphabetic 
spellers may be able to use the beginning letters and sounds of words to help but frequently 
must also turn to context clues to read the words on the page (Adams, 1990; Biemiller, 1970; 
Johnston, 2000). They simply don’t know enough words or patterns to apply analogy. How-
ever, students in the latter part of the letter name–alphabetic stage could be expected to sound 
out flat because they know other written words that sound and look the same, and they know 
something about blends and short vowels. Having students read at their instructional levels 
means that they can read most words correctly and when they encounter unfamiliar words in 
text, their orthographic knowledge, combined with context, will usually help them read the 
words with adequate comprehension. There are parallels between oral reading errors and the 
types of spelling errors students make but there is not a one-to-one match, for with the use of 
context, students can read more difficult words than they can spell.
Qualitative Spelling Inventories
Although observations made during writing and reading offer some insight into students’ 
development, assessments should also include an informal qualitative spelling inventory.
Spelling inventories consist of lists of words specially chosen to represent a variety of 
spelling features at increasing levels of difficulty. The lists are not exhaustive in that they do 
not test all spelling features; rather, they include orthographic features that are most helpful in 
identifying a stage and planning instruction. Students take an inventory as they would a spelling 
test. The results are then analysed to obtain a general picture of their orthographic development.
The Development of Inventories
The first inventories were developed under the leadership of Edmund Henderson at the 
University of Virginia. Most of these inventories consist of a list of words sampling a range 
of spelling features characteristic of each stage (Bear, 1982; Ganske, 1999; Invernizzi, 1992; 
Invernizzi, Meier & Juel, 2003; Morris, 1999; Viise, 1994). The same developmental pro-
gression has been documented through the use of these inventories with learning disabled 
students (Invernizzi & Worthy, 1989), students identified as dyslexic (Sawyer, Wade & Kim, 
1999) and functionally literate adults (Worthy & Viise, 1996). Spelling inventories have also

been developed and researched for other alphabetic languages (Ford & Invernizzi, 2009; Gill, 
1980; Temple, 1978; Yang, 2005).
Although there are multiple assessment tools that may be used with a broad range of 
students in preschool, primary, intermediate and secondary classrooms (see Table 2.4 later in 
this chapter for examples), in this chapter we start by focusing on the three inventories shown 
in Table 2.1: the Primary Spelling Inventory (PSI), the Elementary Spelling Inventory (ESI) 
and the Upper-Level Spelling Inventory (USI). Each can be found in Appendix A, or printed 
from the website that accompanies this book.
Using Inventories
Spelling inventories are quick and easy to administer and score, and they are reliable and valid 
measures of what students know about words. Many teachers find these spelling inventories 
to be the most helpful and easily administered literacy assessments in their repertoires. Using 
these spelling inventories requires the four basic steps summarised here and discussed in detail 
in the sections that follow.
1.	 Select a spelling inventory based on grade level and students’ achievement levels. Admin-
ister the inventory much as you would a traditional spelling test, but do not let students 
study the words in advance.
2.	 Analyse students’ spellings using a feature guide. This analysis will help you identify 
what orthographic features students know and what they are ready to study, as well as 
their approximate stage.
3.	 Organise groups using a classroom composite form and/or the spelling-by-stage 
classroom organisation chart. These will help you plan instruction for developmental 
groups.
4.	 Monitor overall progress by using the same inventory up to three times a year. Weekly 
spelling tests and unit spell checks will also help you assess students’ mastery of the ortho-
graphic features they study.
Selecting an Inventory.  The best guide to selecting an inventory is the grade 
level of the students you teach. However, you may find that you need an easier or more chal-
lenging assessment depending on the range of achievement in your classroom. Table 2.1 is a 
guide to making your selection. Specific directions are provided in Appendix A for each inven-
tory, but the administration is similar for all of them.
Some teachers begin with the same list for all students but shift to small-group admin-
istration of other lists. For example, a second-grade teacher may begin with the Primary 
Spelling Inventory and decide to continue testing a group of students who spelled most of 
the words correctly using the Elementary Spelling Inventory. A key point to keep in mind is 
that students must generate about five errors for you to determine a spelling stage. The three 
spelling inventories described in this chapter can cover the range of students from primary to 
high school and college.

Primary Spelling Inventory.  The Primary Spelling Inventory (PSI) (Appendix A, page 
339) consists of a list of 26 words that begins with simple CVC words (fan, pet) and ends 
with inflectional endings (clapping, riding). It is recommended for kindergarten through 
early third grade because it assesses features found from the emergent stage through the 
within word pattern stage. The PSI has been used widely along with the accompanying 
feature guide and is a reliable scale of developmental word knowledge. The PSI validity 
was established using the California Standards Tests (CST) for English Language Arts 
(ELA) (Sterbinsky, 2007).
For kindergarten students or with other emergent readers, you may only need to call out 
the first five words. In an early first-grade classroom, call out at least 15 words so that you 
sample digraphs and blends; use the entire list of 26 words for late first grade, and second 
and third grades. For students who spell more than 20 words correctly, you should use the 
Elementary Spelling Inventory.
Elementary Spelling Inventory.  The Elementary Spelling Inventory (ESI) (Appendix A, page 
343) is a list of 25 increasingly difficult words that begins with bed and ends with opposition. 
The ESI can be used in grades 1 through 6 to identify students up to the derivational relations 
stage. If a school or school system wants to use the same inventory throughout the elementary 
grades to track growth over time, this inventory is a good choice, but we especially recom-
mend this inventory for grades 3 through 5. By third grade, most students can try to spell all 
25 words, but be ready to discontinue testing for any students who are visibly frustrated or 
misspell five in a row. We have found that this inventory tends to overestimate upper-level 
spellers so students who spell more than 18 words correctly should be given the Upper-Level 
Spelling Inventory.
The words on the ESI present a reliable scale of developmental word knowledge. As with 
the PSI, the validity of the ESI was established using the California Standard Tests (CST) for 
English Language Arts (ELA) (Sterbinsky, 2007). In this study with 862 students, the relation-
ships between scores on the ESI teachers’ stage analysis and standardised reading and spell-
ing test scores were moderate to strong. Using these inventories can be considered a stable 
measure to screen for developmental levels.
Upper-Level Spelling Inventory.  The Upper-Level Spelling Inventory (USI) (Appendix A, 
page 346) can be used in upper elementary, middle and high school. The USI is also suitable 
for assessing the orthographic knowledge of students at college and university levels, as well 
as adults in general equivalency diploma (GED) programs. List words were chosen because 
they help identify—more specifically than the ESI—what students in the syllables and affixes 
and derivational relations stages are doing in their spelling.
The USI is a list of 31 words, arranged in order of difficulty from switch to succession. 
The USI is highly reliable; for example, scores of 183 fifth-graders on the USI significantly 
predicted their scores on the Word Analysis subtest of the CST four months later (Sterbinsky, 
2007). With normally achieving students, you can administer the entire list, but stop giving 
the USI to students who have misspelled five of the first eight words—the words that assess 
spelling in the within word pattern stage. The teacher should use the ESI with these students 
to identify within word pattern features that need instruction.
Preparing Students for the Spelling Inventory.  Unlike weekly 
spelling tests, these inventories are not used for grading purposes and students should not 
study the particular words either before or after the inventory is administered. Set aside 20 
to 30 minutes to administer an inventory. Ask students to number a paper as they would for 
a traditional spelling test. For younger children, you may want to prepare papers in advance 
with one or two numbered columns. (Invariably, a few younger students write across the 
page from left to right.) Very young children should have an alphabet strip on their desks for 
reference in case they forget how to form a particular letter. Sometimes it is easier to create 
a relaxed environment working in small groups, especially with kindergarten and first-grade 
students. Children who are in second grade and older are usually familiar with spelling tests 
and can take the inventory as a whole class. If any students appear upset and frustrated, you 

	 52

may assess them individually at another time or use samples of their writing to determine an 
instructional level with the Qualitative Spelling Checklist.
Students must understand the reason for taking the inventory so they will do their best. 
They may be anxious, so be direct in your explanation:
“I am going to ask you to spell some words. You have not studied these words and will not be 
graded on them. Some of the words may be easy and others may be difficult. Do the best you 
can. Your work will help me understand how you are learning to read and write and how I can 
help you.”
Teachers often tell students that as long as they try their best in spelling the words, they will 
earn an A for the assignment. Once these things are explained, most students are able to give 
the spelling a good effort. You can conduct lessons, such as described in Figure 2.2, to prepare 
younger students for the assessment or to validate the use of invented spelling during writing. 
Lessons like these are designed to show students how to sound out words they are unsure of 
how to spell.
Some students will try to copy if they feel especially concerned about doing well on a test. 
Creating a relaxed atmosphere with the explanation suggested above can help overcome some 
of the stress students feel. Arrange seating to minimise the risk of copying or hand out cover 
sheets. Some teachers give students manila folders to set up right around their papers to create 
personal workspaces. There will be many opportunities to collect corroborating information, 
To help young students feel more comfortable attempting to 
spell words, conduct several lessons either in small groups or 
with the whole class using the theme “How to Spell the Best 
We Can.” You might do this to prepare young students for 
taking the inventory or to encourage them to invent spellings 
during writing. If you want students to produce quality 
writing, they need to be willing to take risks in their spelling. 
Hesitant writers who labour over spelling or avoid using words 
they can’t spell lose the reward of expressing themselves.
A Discussion to Encourage Invented Spelling
“We’re going to do a lot of writing this year. When we want 
to write a word, and we don’t know how to spell it, what 
might we do?” Student responses usually include:
“Ask the teacher.”
“Ask someone.”
“Look it up.”
“Skip it.”
If no one suggests the strategy of listening for sounds, 
you can tell your students, “Write down all the sounds you 
hear when you say the word to spell it the best you can.”
Spell a Few Words Together
“Who has a word they want to spell?”
Following a lesson on sea life, a student may offer, “Sea turtle”.
“That’s a great one. Can we keep to the second word, 
turtle?” Assuming they agree, ask students to say the 
word turtle. Encourage them to say it slowly, stretching out 
the sounds and breaking it into two syllables (turrr-tllllle). 
Model how to listen for the sounds and think about the 
letters that spell those sounds: “Listen. T-t-t-turtle. What’s the 
first sound at the beginning of turtle? What letter do we use 
to spell that /t/ sound?”
“Turtle. T ”.
Write a T. Then ask a few students for the next sounds 
they “hear” and “feel”.
Depending on the level of the group, you may generate 
a range of possible spellings: TL, TRTL, TERDL and TERTUL.
Finally, talk about what to do if the student can only 
figure out one or two sounds in a word. “Start with the 
sound at the beginning. Write the first letter and then draw 
a line.” Here, write T with a line.
T ___________
Occasionally, a student will be critical about another 
student’s attempt: “That’s not the right way to spell it!” 
Be careful to handle this criticism firmly. You might say, 
“The important thing is that you have written your word 
down and you can reread what you have written.” Remind 
students that they are learning; there will be times when 
they do not know how to spell a word and it is okay to spell 
it the best they can. Encourage them by saying, “You will 
see your writing improve the more you write. At the end of 
the year, you will be surprised by how much more you can 
write.”

so there is no reason to be upset if primary students copy. If 
it is clear that a student has copied, make a note to this effect 
after collecting the papers and administer the inventory indi-
vidually at another time.
Administer the Inventory.  When administer-
ing a spelling inventory, call the words aloud by pronounc-
ing each word naturally without drawing out the sounds or 
breaking them into syllables. Say each word twice and use it 
in a sentence if context will help students know what word is 
being called. For example, use cellar in a sentence to differenti-
ate it from seller. Sentences are provided with the word lists 
in Appendix A. For most words, however, offering sentences is 
time-consuming and may even be distracting.
Move around the room as you call the words aloud to 
monitor students’ work and observe their behaviours. Look 
for words you cannot read due to poor handwriting. Without 
making students feel that something is wrong, it is appropriate 
to ask them to rewrite the word or later to read the letters in 
the words that cannot be deciphered. Students using cursive 
whose writing is difficult to read can be asked to print.
Occasionally, if there is time, students are asked to take a 
second try at spelling words about which they may have been 
unsure. Through this reexamination, students show their willingness to reflect on their 
work. These notations and successive attempts are additional indicators of the depth of 
students’ orthographic knowledge.
Know When to Stop.  As you walk around the room or work with a small 
group, scan students’ papers and watch for misspellings and signs of frustration to deter-
mine whether to continue with the list. With younger students who tire quickly, you 
might stop after the first five words if they do not spell any correctly. For older students 
in groups, who can usually take an entire inventory in about 20 minutes, it is better to 
err on the side of too many words than too few. Rather 
than being singled out to stop, some students may 
prefer to “save face” by attempting every word called 
out to the group even when working at a frustration 
level. In Figure 2.3, you can see that Jake missed more 
than half the words on the inventory but continued 
to make good attempts at words that were clearly too 
difficult for him. However, his six errors in the first 15 
words identify him as needing work on vowel patterns, 
and testing could have been discontinued at that point. 
Sometimes teachers are required to administer the 
entire list in order to have a complete set of data for 
each child. In this case, tell students before you start 
that the words will become difficult but to do the best 
they can.
Score and Analyse the Spelling 
Inventories
After you administer the inventory, collect the papers 
and set aside time to score and analyse the results.

right or wrong. Instead, each word has a number of orthographic “features” that are counted 
separately. For example, a student who spells when as WEN knows the correct short vowel 
and ending consonant and gets points for knowing those features even though the complete 
spelling is not correct. The feature guides will help you score each word in this manner. This 
analysis provides qualitative information regarding what students know about specific spelling 
features and what they are ready to study next.
Establish a Power Score.  Begin by marking the words right or wrong. It helps 
to write the correct spellings beside the misspelled words as was done in the sample of Jake’s 
spelling in Figure 2.3. This step focuses your attention on each word and the parts of the 
words that were right and wrong (key to the qualitative feature analysis). Scoring in this 
way also makes it easier for other teachers and parents to understand students’ papers. Cal-
culate a raw score or power score (nine words correct on Jake’s paper in Figure 2.3). and refer 
to Table 2.2 below to get a rough estimate of the student’s spelling stage. The table lists the 
power scores on the three major Words Their Way™ inventories in relation to estimated stages 
and their breakdown by early, middle or late stage designations. As we can see, Jake’s ESI 
power score of 9 places him in the late within word pattern stage.
Score the Feature Guides.  Feature guides help teachers analyse student errors 
and confirm the stage designations suggested by the power score. The feature guides that 
accompany each inventory are included in Appendix A and are found on the PDToolkit. Jake’s 
spellings are used as an example in Figure 2.4 to guide you in the scoring process. Use the 
following steps to complete the feature guide. Alternatively, the assessment application on the 
website allows you to score the inventory electronically.
1.	 To score by hand, make a copy of the appropriate feature guide for each student and 
record the date of testing. The spelling features are listed in the second row of the feature 
guide and follow the developmental sequence observed in research.
2.	 Look to the right of each word to check off features of the word that are represented cor-
rectly. For example, because Jake spelled bed correctly, there is a check for the beginning 
consonant, the final consonant and the short vowel for a total of three feature points. Jake 
also gets a point for spelling the word correctly, recorded in the far right column. For the 
word bright, which he spelled as BRITE, he gets a check for the blend but not for the igh 
spelling pattern. Notice on Jake’s feature guide in Figure 2.4 how the vowel patterns he 
substituted have been written in the space beside the vowel feature to show that Jake is

using but confusing these patterns. Every feature in every word is not scored; however, 
the features sampled are sufficient to identify the stages of spelling.
3.	 After scoring each word, add the checks in each column and record the total score for 
that column at the bottom as a ratio of correct responses to total possible features. (Adjust 
this ratio and the total possible points if you do not have a student spell all of the words.) 
Notice how Jake scored six out of six under Digraphs, seven out of seven for Blends, and 
four out of five under Long Vowels. Add the total feature scores across the bottom and 
the total words spelled correctly. This gives you an overall total score that you can use to 
rank order students and to compare individual growth over time. If you use the assess-
ment application on the website, it will calculate the total feature scores and the spelling 
stage for you.
Common Confusions in Scoring.  To ensure consistency in scoring students’ 
spelling, keep the following points in mind when you consider reversals and a few confusing 
spelling errors.
Reversals.  Letter reversals, such as writing b as d, are not unusual in young spellers, and ques-
tions often arise about how to score them. Reversals should be noted, but in the qualitative 
analysis, reversals should be seen as the letters they were meant to represent and not counted 
as wrong. These might be considered handwriting errors rather than spelling errors. A static 
reversal, such as the b written backward in bed or the p reversed in ship, should be counted 
as correct. There is space in the boxes of the feature analysis to make note of these reversals. 
Record what the student did, but add the check to give credit for representing the sound. 
Letter reversals occur with decreasing frequency through the letter name–alphabetic stage.
Confusions can also arise in scoring kinetic reversals when the letters are present but out 
of order. For example, beginning spellers sometimes spell the familiar consonant sounds and 
then tag on a vowel at the end (e.g., FNA for fan). This can be due to repeating each sound in 
the word fan and extracting the short a after having already recorded the FN. With students 
in the early stages of spelling give credit for the consonants and vowels that are present but do 
not give a point for correct spelling. However, when students reverse letters in vowel patterns, 
such as spelling train as TRIAN or bright as BRIHGT, do not give credit for the feature since 
this suggests they need more work on the pattern.
Other Confusions.  There are a few unique errors to consider that can be confusing to score. 
Early beginning spellers sometimes spell part of the word and then add a random string of 
letters to make it look longer (e.g., FNWZTY for fan). Older students will sometimes add 
vowel markers where they are not needed (as in FANE for fan) or will include two possibilities 
when in doubt (as in LOOKTED for looked or TRAINE for train). In these cases, students 
should get credit for what they represent correctly. In the case of FANE for fan or TRAINE 
for train, the student would get credit for the consonants and vowel features but would not get 
the extra point for spelling the word correctly. In general, give students credit when in doubt 
and make a note of the strategy they might be using. Such errors offer interesting insights into 
their developing word knowledge. FANE for fan may be incorrect but it represents a more 
sophisticated attempt than FN since the short vowel is correctly represented.
Identify Features for Instruction.  The completed feature guide can be 
used to determine a starting place for instruction. Looking across the feature columns from 
left to right, instruction should begin at the point where a student first makes two or more errors on 
a feature. Consider the totals along the bottom of Jake’s feature guide. Ask yourself what he 
knows and what he is using but confusing. His scores indicate that he has mastery of Conso-
nants and Short Vowels, so he does not need instruction there. Jake only missed one of the 
Long Vowels (igh in bright) for a score of 4/5 and this can be considered an acceptable score. 
However, he missed two of the Other Vowels, so this is the feature that needs attention dur-
ing instruction.
The features in the columns are presented in a general scope and sequence from begin-
ning consonants to roots. However, there may be times when you vary the order of feature

57
presentation. For example, some students may need more work on short vowels even when 
they have mastered blends and digraphs. In the upper spelling stages we sometimes see stu-
dents ready to study a number of features at the same time. In this case, the order will not be 
as important and this offers more flexibility in grouping.
Determine a Developmental Stage.  The continuum of features at the top 
of the feature guide shows gradations for each developmental stage of early, middle and late. 
A student who has learned to spell most of the features relevant to a stage is probably at the 
end of that stage. Conversely, if a student is beginning to use the key elements of a feature but 
still has some misspellings from the previous stage, the student is at an early point in that new 
stage. Tables in each instructional chapter (Chapters 4 to 8) provide additional information 
about how to determine where students are within each stage. These gradations make assess-
ing orthographic knowledge more precise than simply an overall stage designation, and this 
precision will be useful in designing a word study curriculum.
Developmental levels should be circled in the shaded bar across the top that lists the 
stages. For example, Jake spelled all of the Short Vowels and most Long Vowel features cor-
rectly, and he also spelled some of the words in the Other Vowels category, so Jake is at least 
in the middle of the within word pattern stage. This has been circled in the top row. These 
stage designations can be used to complete the Spelling-by-Stage form described later in this 
chapter that will help you create instructional groups. Knowing the student’s developmental 
stage is a guide to the instructional chapter for word study. In Jake’s case, refer to Chapter 6 
for activities.
You do not need to make the discrimination within stages too weighty a decision. When 
it comes to planning instruction, take a step backward to choose word study activities at a 
slightly easier level than the stage determination may indicate. It is more effective to introduce 
students to sorting routines when they are working with familiar features and known words; 
moreover, it is easier to move students up to a higher group than to move them back to a 
lower group.
Spelling inventory results should be compared to what we know about students’ ortho-
graphic knowledge from their reading and writing. Together, reading, writing and spelling 
inventories provide a rich collection of information to understand students’ knowledge of 
orthography. Use the Synchrony of Literacy Development model in Figure 1.12 on page 40 
by reading from top to bottom across the literacy behaviours of reading, spelling and writing. 
Look for corroborating evidence to place students’ achievement along the developmental 
continuum. This model helps to generate expectations for student development using an 
integrated literacy approach. A student’s reading behaviours should be in synchrony with his 
or her range of writing behaviours.
Referring back to Jake’s writing in Figure 2.1, we see similar strengths and weaknesses. 
His mastery of short vowels and his experimentation with long vowels and other vowels is 
what we would expect of a student in the middle to late within word pattern stage of spelling. 
When Jake reads he may confuse words like choose and chose. These errors in word identifica-
tion will be addressed in word study when he examines the other vowels. His spelling inven-
tory, writing sample, and reading errors offer supporting evidence that we have identified his 
developmental stage and the features that need attention.
Some students are out of synchrony in their development, such as the one who is notori-
ously poor at spelling but is a capable reader. When there is a mismatch between reading and 
spelling development, you can help improve spelling and obtain synchrony by pinpointing 
the stage of spelling development and then providing instruction that addresses the student’s 
needs.
Sample Practice
The spelling examples of five students in Figure 2.5 can be used to practise analysing stu-
dent spellings and determining a developmental stage if you do not have a class of children 
to assess or if you want to try analysing a broad spectrum of responses. Make a copy of the

ESI feature guide for each student. Determine both the developmental stage of the speller and 
the place you would start instruction. After you are finished, check the results at the bottom 
of the page. Were you close in the stages you selected? If you scored the spelling in terms of 
the three gradations within a stage, you may find that although your assessment may differ by 
a stage name, it is possible that the difference is just between the latter part of one stage and 
the early part of the next. Also compute a power score for each student (number correct) and 
use the table on page 54 to estimate the stage. Were your results similar?
Group Students for Instruction
Your spelling analysis as discussed in the previous section will pinpoint students’ instructional 
levels and the features that are ripe for instruction. In most classrooms, there will be a range 
in students’ word knowledge. For example, in a second-grade class most students will be in the 
within word pattern stage but there will also be students in the letter name–alphabetic stage 
who need to study short vowels and consonant blends, while others may be in the syllables and 
affixes stage and ready to study two-syllable words. After analysing students individually, you 
can create a classroom profile by recording the individual assessment data on a single chart.
We present two ways to record information about the class: the classroom composite to 
group students by features, and the spelling-by-stage classroom organisation chart to group 
students by developmental levels. These charts show you the instructional groups at a glance. 
Before we discuss them, however, let’s consider the importance of grouping for instruction in 
word study.
Grouping to Meet Students’ Diverse Needs
Grouping for instruction is a challenge for teachers and there are reasons to be suspicious of 
ability grouping. There may be stigmas associated with grouping and sometimes the lower-
ability groups receive inferior instruction (Allington & Cunningham, 2006; Morris, 2008). 
However, students benefit from differentiated instruction. Experience shows that when stu-
dents study a particular orthographic feature, it is best if they are in groups with students who 
are ready to study the same feature. For example, it is difficult to study long-vowel patterns 
when some of the students in the group still need work on digraphs or blends and may not 
even be able to read the words that contain the long-vowel patterns. When students are taught 
at their instructional levels in spelling (even when instruction is below grade level), they will 
make more progress than with materials that are too difficult for them (Morris, Blanton, Blan-
ton, Nowacek & Perney, 1995). Chapter 3 offers suggestions about how to manage multiple 
instructional groups.
Classroom Composite Chart
After administering an inventory and completing a feature guide for each student, transfer the 
individual scores in the last row of the form to a Classroom Composite Chart (Figure 2.6) to 
get a sense of the group as a whole. If you use the electronic assessment application on the 
website, the Classroom Composite Chart will be created automatically. The following steps 
will help you do this manually.
1.	 Begin by stapling each student’s spelling test and feature guide together.
2.	 Sort student papers by the power score (or number of words correct) or by the total fea-
ture score, and record students’ names from top to bottom on the composite form on the 
basis of this rank order.
3.	 Next, record scores from the bottom row of each student’s feature guide in the row beside 
his or her name on the composite chart.
4.	 Highlight cells in which students are making two or more errors on a particular feature 
and column. For example, a student who spells all but one of the short vowels correctly

has an adequate understanding of short vowels and is considered to be at an independent 
level. However, students who misspell two or three of the short vowels need more work 
on that feature. Highlighted cells indicate a need for sustained instruction on a feature. 
Do not highlight cells in which students score a zero because this indicates frustration 
level rather than using but confusing a feature. Focus instead on features in columns to 
the left of any zero levels that need attention first.
5.	 Look for instructional groups. If you rank order your students when completing the 
composite chart, you can find clusters of highlighted cells that can be used to assign stu-
dents to developmental stages and word study groups. For example, the fifth-grade class 
composite in Figure 2.6 shows that many students fall under the syllables and affixes stage 
of development because this is where they are making two or more spelling errors (stu-
dents 3 through 16). John, Maria R. and Patty, who missed more than two words in vowel 
patterns, might join this group or might go in a lower group, but should be carefully 
monitored. A smaller group of students falls under the middle-to-late within word pattern 
stage (students 17 through 25), and should begin word study by looking at single-syllable 
word patterns for long vowels and then other vowel patterns. One student (Mike) needs 
individualised help, beginning with short vowels as well as digraphs and blends. At the 
upper end of the class composite are two children who fall into the derivational relations 
stage. However, we suggest that any students who score more than 18 or better on the ESI 
be re-assessed with the USI to gather more information about particular features to study.
Spelling-by-Stage Classroom Organisation Chart
When you know students’ developmental stages, you can also form groups with the Spelling-
by-Stage Classroom Organisation Chart (see Figure 2.7). Many teachers find this easier to 
use than a class composite when planning groups. Refer to the stage circled in the shaded bar 
with the developmental stages on each student’s feature guide. Students’ names are recorded 
underneath a spelling stage on the chart, differentiating among those who are early, middle 
or late. (To determine early, middle and late designations, refer to each chapter for further 
information.) Once the names are entered, begin to look for groups. In each of the classroom 
examples in Figure 2.7, three or four groups have been circled.
You can see different ways to organise word study instruction in the three classroom 
profiles presented in Figure 2.7. The first profile is of a first-grade class with many emer-
gent spellers. The four circled groups suggested for this class are also the teacher’s reading 
groups.
In the third- and sixth-grade examples, you can see where teachers have used arrows to 
reconsider the group placement of a few students. Inventory results are considered along with 
other observations of students’ reading or writing. The arrows indicate students who might 
be placed slightly higher or lower as the groups take shape. Some of the group placement 
decisions are also based on social and psychological factors related to self-esteem, leadership 
and behaviour dynamics.
The teacher in the sixth-grade classroom could consider running two groups at the upper 
levels or combining them as one group. The three students in the letter name–alphabetic stage 
will need special attention because they are significantly behind for sixth graders. Ideally, these 
students will have additional instruction with a literacy specialist or in a tutoring program to 
review and practise activities that are appropriate for the letter name–alphabetic spelling stage.
Factors to Consider when Organising Groups
The Classroom Composite Chart and the Spelling-by-Stage Classroom Organisation Chart 
help to determine word study groups for instruction. While students within a class work 
on different features and with different words, they can still work side by side during many 
of the follow-up word study routines that occur after the initial small-group discussion. 
Different schemes for managing class, group and individual word study are discussed in 
Chapter 3.

If there is a wide range of achievement some students may not be placed exactly at their 
developmental stages. Although you will certainly try to accommodate them, your best spellers 
are not likely to be negatively affected with grade-level word study activities that might be a 
bit easy for them. However, your less able spellers will probably suffer if they are working at 
a frustration level in which they will not make progress, so group your neediest students as 
close as possible to their instructional level.
In many classrooms, there are students at each end of the developmental continuum who, 
in terms of word study and orthographic development, are outliers. For example, Zac, in the 
third-grade class in Figure 2.7, is the only student in the middle syllables and affixes stage and 
it is impractical to place him in a group by himself. He has been placed in the closest group 
for instruction. However, you might accommodate Zac by asking him to work with a different, 
more difficult set of words sharing the same features that the early syllables and affixes spell-
ers are studying, such as harder words with open and closed syllables. Less advanced students, 
such as Jon in the sixth-grade example in Figure 2.7, may work with partners who can help 
them read and sort the group’s words, such as one-syllable words with long-vowel patterns. 
English language learners also benefit from sorting with partners who can clarify word pro-
nunciations and meanings.
Interpreting feature guides, determining stages and then creating and monitoring groups 
involves ongoing assessment, observations and teacher judgment. It cannot be reduced to a 
simple formula. Be assured that over time you will gain expertise and satisfaction in being able 
to accurately identify and meet the instructional needs of your students.
Other Assessments
There are other assessments and forms useful as supplements or alternatives to the Primary, 
Elementary or Upper-Level Spelling Inventories. For example the Emergent Class Record 
and the Kindergarten Spelling Inventory are appropriate for young students. Some teachers 
may want to have data for reporting grade-level achievement and will find the McGuffey 
Spelling Inventory useful. Other teachers prefer to have a single, continuous feature inventory 
that can be used across all grade levels such as Viise’s Word Feature Inventory. Finally, Spell 
Checks and Goal Setting Forms can help teachers closely monitor progress. The alternate 
assessments described in this section and listed in Table 2.3 can meet all of these needs. These 
assessments can be found online to print out for use in your classroom.

Qualitative Spelling Checklist
When you look at students’ writing in their journals or in the first drafts of their reports and 
stories, you can use the Qualitative Spelling Checklist (page 336 in Appendix A) to verify what 
types of orthographic features students have mastered, what types of features they are using 
but confusing, and the degree to which they are applying their spelling knowledge in actual 
writing. Through a series of 20 questions, you check off the student’s progress through the 
stages. Consider what features are used consistently, often or not at all. The checklist is set up 
to be used at three different points during the school year and can serve as a record of progress 
over time. Collecting a variety of writing samples across the curricular areas is a great way to 
verify students’ application and transfer of their word study instruction.
Emergent Class Record
The Emergent Class Record is used to assess daily writing or spelling inventory results of  
pre K children, kindergarten students or other emergent spellers. Making a copy of the 
PSI feature guide for each student may seem like a waste of paper when at most they will 
only score a few initial and final consonants. The Emergent Class Record can be used as an 
alternative with the entire class represented on one form. It captures the prephonetic writ-
ing progression (from random marks to letters) that is missing from the other feature guides 
and covers the range from emergent through letter name–alphabetic spelling that is expected 
in many kindergarten classes at the beginning of the year. Other emergent assessments are 
described in Chapter 4 and are available to print from the website.
Kindergarten Spelling Inventory
The Kindergarten Spelling Inventory (KSI) has been used widely with thousands of children 
as part of Virginia’s Phonological Assessment and Literacy Screening (PALS) (Invernizzi, Juel, 
Swank & Meier, 2006). Carefully chosen after extensive research, each of five three-phoneme 
words is scored for the number of phonemes represented in a student’s spelling. A feature 
guide is provided, but unlike the feature guides described so far, students get credit for identi-
fying phonemes and representing those sounds with phonetically logical letters, even if those 
letters are actually incorrect. As a result, the KSI is a reliable measure of phonemic awareness 
development, letter–sound correspondences and the gradual development of conventional 
spelling (Invernizzi, Justice, Landrum & Booker, 2005). KSI scores in kindergarten predict 
children’s end-of-year reading standards scores as much as three years later (Invernizzi, Juel, 
Swank & Meier, 2008).
McGuffey Spelling Inventory
The McGuffey Qualitative Inventory of Word Knowledge (QIWK) (Schlagal, 1992) is useful 
for conducting individual testing and for obtaining grade-level information. The inventory 
spans grades 1 through 8, with 20 to 30 words in each level. After administering the grade-
level list, use the list from the previous grade level with students who fall below 50 percent 
and use the list from the next higher grade level for students who score above 90 percent to 
determine an instructional spelling level (Morris, Blanton, Blanton & Perney, 1995; Morris 
et al., 1986).
The McGuffey Inventory is especially useful when you want to report spelling achieve-
ment in terms of grade levels. In addition, the words in these lists present plenty of oppor-
tunities to observe a student’s spelling across a variety of features. For example, for teachers 
wanting to obtain a fuller assessment of prefixes, suffixes and roots, Levels 5 and 6 offer a 
larger number of derivational words with prefixes and suffixes to analyse. Because a feature 
guide has not been developed for the McGuffey Inventory, you must analyse errors your-
self to determine which features and patterns students know, and which they are using but 
confusing.

Viise’s Word Feature Inventory
The Word Feature Inventory (WFI) developed by Neva Viise is another qualitative inventory 
(Viise, 1996; Worthy & Viise, 1996). The WFI is divided into four achievement levels corre-
sponding to four of the five stages of developmental word knowledge: letter name–alphabetic, 
within word pattern, syllables and affixes and derivational relations. The words on each level 
are divided into groups of five, each subgroup probing the student’s treatment of a specific 
word feature such as short vowel, consonant blend, long-vowel pattern and so on. As with the 
PSI, ESI and USI, an assessment of students’ spellings of the words on this list will indicate 
the features that have already been mastered and pinpoint the level at which instruction must 
begin. The WFI is a continuous measure and can be used across all grade levels.
Set Goals and Monitor  
Student Growth over Time
Monitoring students’ progress in response to instruction has gained importance in the last few 
years. Brief, ongoing assessment alerts us to the need for adjusting the content and pacing of 
our instruction to meet student needs, and arranging additional instruction for students who 
may need extra help meeting long-term goals.
Use a Variety of Assessments to Monitor Growth
Teachers have been monitoring their students’ progress for years through weekly spelling tests 
that provide immediate feedback regarding students’ short-term retention of specific words 
they have studied. But few teachers consider long-term retention, the generalisation of the 
spelling patterns students have learned relative to words they may not have studied, or the 
application of students’ orthographic word knowledge in their writing. We offer several ways 
you can monitor progress in orthographic development in the short and long terms.
Weekly Spelling Tests and Unit Tests.  We recommend weekly tests at 
most grade levels as a way to monitor mastery of the studied features, and to send a message 
to students and parents alike that students are accountable for learning to spell the words 
they have sorted and worked with in various activities all week. Students will usually be 
successful on these weekly tests when they are appropriately placed for instruction. If they 
are incorrectly spelling more than a few words, it may mean that you need to adjust your 
instruction. They may either need to spend more time on a feature, or they are not ready 
to study the feature and should work on easier patterns first. 
You may also want to periodically give a review test or unit 
test—without asking students to study in advance—to check 
for retention. Simply select a sample of words from previous 
lessons and call them aloud as you would for any spelling test 
or use the prepared spell checks on the PDToolkit and in the 
Words Their Way supplements.
Spelling Inventories.  Students may be given the 
same spelling inventory up to three times during the year to 
assess progress and to determine whether changes need to be 
made in groups or instructional focus. You can even use the 
same paper several times if you fold back previous results and 
ask students to record their latest effort in the next column. 
­Figure 2.8 shows Benny’s spelling inventory results at three 
different times during the first-grade year recorded on the 
same form. He has made noticeable progress during the year,

moving from early letter name–alphabetic spelling to the within word pattern stage. However, 
don’t expect such dramatic progress in one year beyond the primary grades. Some students 
will take two years to master the within word pattern stage. Therefore, teachers in upper 
elementary, middle school and high school may find that using an inventory only at the begin-
ning and end of the year is sufficient.
We recommend using the same spelling inventory each time so that you can compare 
progress on the same words. In Benny’s inventory results, we can track the qualitative changes 
in his spelling over time. Don’t be too surprised if students sometimes spell a word correctly 
one time and later spell the same word incorrectly. Because students are sometimes inventing 
a spelling for a word that they do not have stored in memory, they may invent it correctly 
one time and not the next. Or they might master short vowel sound matches but later use but 
confuse silent vowel markers as Benny did in his spelling of fan as FANE.
Remember that you should not have students directly study the words in the inventory, 
although the words may naturally show up in word study activities that you plan. If students 
study the list in advance, assessment results will be inflated and you will lose valuable diagnostic 
information. Using the same inventory more than three times a year may also familiarise stu-
dents with the words enough to inflate the results. In between administrations of the spelling 
inventories, use the spell checks described next to monitor progress within and across stages.
Spell Checks.  Spell checks are mini-inventories that can be used over shorter periods 
of time than spelling inventories to monitor students’ generalisation of specific features over 
and beyond what they may have demonstrated on weekly spelling tests. Spell checks serve 
several purposes: (1) to fine-tune placement, (2) as a pretest for a feature or unit of study 
before instruction to determine what students already know, (3) as a posttest after instruction 
to determine what students have learned and (4) as a delayed posttest administered several 
weeks after instruction to determine what students have retained over time.
Like inventories, spell checks are organised by sequential groups of phonics features 
and spelling patterns, but each spell check includes more features and more words for each 
feature within a stage. Because spell checks are more thorough, they can be used to confirm 
the stage designation and placement determined by the spelling inventories. If students 
misspell only one or two words in a feature category on the inventory, you may want to do 
some further assessment using the spell checks. In Jake’s case, we might want to gather some 
more information about his knowledge of less common long-vowel patterns because he 
misspelled bright. If Jake were to spell at least eight (out of ten) words correctly on the spell 
check for less common long-vowel patterns, you would have additional assurance that he is 
ready to move on to the study of r-influenced 
vowels, the next set of features in the scope and 
sequence towards the latter part of the within 
word pattern stage.
Spell checks can also be used as pretests to con-
firm the appropriateness of the next unit of instruc-
tion. Jake might be given a pretest on r-influenced 
vowels, in which a score of 30 to 70 percent would 
suggest that he is using but confusing this feature, 
making it an area ripe for instruction.
Spell checks are also used to monitor prog-
ress and refine the focus and pacing of instruc-
tion for individuals or small groups. Figure 2.9 
shows Omar’s spell checks for short vowels 
and preconsonantal nasal sounds (the m’s and 
n’s that come before consonants at the end of 
words). The first is a pretest on which he scored  
30 percent. The second, using a different form 
on which he scored 90 percent, was given after 
he had spent several weeks working on that

feature in his word sorts. Several weeks later, his teacher assessed his ­retention of this feature 
by administering another form of the same spell check. Although Omar misspelled two words 
in the delayed posttest, eight out of ten words spelled correctly is still a good indication of 
mastery. His teacher recorded all these scores on the progress monitoring chart for late letter 
name–alphabetic spellers (Figure 2.10). If Omar had scored less than 80 percent on the delayed 
posttest, some targeted review would be needed. In his case, it appears that the ump pattern is a 
problem and words like jump and stump might be compared to words like cup and pup in which 
there is no preconsonantal nasal.
Develop Expectations for Student Progress
Although it true that all students do not develop at the same rate despite the very best instruc-
tion, it helps to articulate end-of-grade expectations in terms of stages of development (see 
Table 2.4). You should know the typical range of development within grade levels so that you 
can provide additional instruction and intervention for students who lag below that range. You 
should also know where students must be (at the very least) at the end of the year if they are 
to succeed in subsequent grades and meet standards in reading and writing.
Goal-Setting/Progress Monitoring Charts
The stage expectations listed by grade level in the right-hand column of Table 2.4 are long-
term, basic goals. Generally speaking, long-term goals reflect your basic expectations for what 
stage your students must be in to succeed in the next grade level. In contrast, short-term goals 
indicate the features necessary to study and learn to reach the basic long-term stage goal

(Flanigan et al., 2011). The goal-setting/progress monitoring charts make explicit what must 
specifically be learned to reach the ultimate long-term goal.
Goal-setting/monitoring charts can be used to track student progress and to guide your 
conferences with specialists, parents and students from early letter name to late syllables and 
affixes. (Charts are not provided beyond the early derivational relations stage because mastery 
continues throughout adulthood.) Use the results from one of the inventories to determine 
which chart is most appropriate. As shown in Figure 2.10, Omar’s teacher has checked off 
each feature Omar used correctly. Omar is making good progress; he could identify most 
short vowels in September and spelled them correctly in CVC words, and words with blends 
and digraphs, and in words with preconsonantal nasals by November. Progress monitoring 
charts help students define a set of goals that are within reach, within their zone of proximal 
development.
Older students should understand exactly what they need to learn to become stronger 
readers and writers, and it can motivate them to be involved in their own short-term goal set-
ting. We recommend that you meet with them individually to share the results of the inventory 
or spell checks and set goals together. Then students can keep a record of their own weekly 
assignments, tests and spell checks to chart their own progress. This is especially helpful for 
students who are struggling with reading, writing and spelling and may feel overwhelmed with 
all they need to learn. It may not be important for them to remember the name of the stage 
they are in or their numerical power scores, but it’s reassuring for them to hear the specifics of 
what features they already know and what features they need to learn next to move forward.
Changing Groups in Response to Progress
Groups should be fluid. If students are frustrated or not challenged by the activities, then 
they should be placed in a different group. Use the progress monitoring assessments to refine 
your groups. When considering whether a student should be moved to a group studying more 
advanced features, seek multiple pieces of evidence.
1.	 First, look at the student’s spelling samples from the spelling inventories and the spell 
checks. Consider both the power scores and the feature scores.
2.	 Next, look at several uncorrected writing samples using the qualitative checklists. If 
students are ready to be moved they should be correctly applying the features they have 
studied in their independent, unedited writing. The goal-setting/progress monitoring 
charts should confirm these sources of evidence.
3.	 Finally, look at the big picture, the synchrony of literacy development. Table 2.5 shows the 
concordance of developmental spelling stages with reading stages and approximate levels 
of reading achievement. If you want to move a student from a late letter name word study 
group to an early within word pattern group, look to see if the student can read at least at a 
first-grade level. Orthographic knowledge develops in synchrony with reading and writing.
In Table 2.5 we present a concordance of spelling and reading stages across the grade 
levels. The text levels represent the most current systems used to level texts. The lexile levels 
(Lexile Framework for Reading, 2013) reflect broad ranges using the new “stretch” ranges 
presented in the Common Core State Standards, though other forms of text complexity 
should be considered. The letters draw on the levels found in Guided Reading Levels (Fountas 
& Pinnell, 2001), and the numbers reflect DRA levels (Beaver & Carter, 2003) and approxi-
mate similar numeric levelling systems used by other publishers such as Rigby and National 
Geographic. The grade levels are general ranges and averages; the actual match will vary. 
The single grade-level designations are mid-year approximations. For example, this table says 
that by mid-year, most third graders are in the early syllables and affixes stage and are early 
intermediate readers. When spelling and reading development is out of synchrony, this often 
indicates that there has been a mismatch of instruction (Invernizzi & Hayes, 2010).

needs and progress. Benny’s parents 
should be able to appreciate the growth 
he has made over his first-grade year, as 
shown in Figure 2.8. It reassures par-
ents to see their child’s earlier invented 
spellings give way to greater accuracy in 
writing. In looking at the end-of-grade 
expectations chart in Table 2.4, we see 
that Benny is right on target as he fin-
ishes first grade entering into the within 
word pattern stage of development.
Unlike some literacy skills, spell-
ing results are visible, and with a little 
explanation parents can understand 
how you are using spelling errors to 
plan instruction. Parents who are accus-
tomed to seeing their children bring 
home lists of spelling words taken from thematic units and content materials are sometimes a 
little dismayed when they see word lists designed for their children’s developmental level. In 
one case, second graders were given words like butterfly, chrysalis and caterpillar to memorise 
for a test each week. When their third-grade teacher designed word study based on a spelling 
inventory, the parents thought the words (drew, flew, blow, snow) were too easy and that their 
children were not being challenged enough. The teacher responded by explaining the spell-
ing inventory and showing parents the results—the students consistently used but confused 
long o and long u patterns. The parents then understood and appreciated that the teacher was 
teaching their children how to spell and not just assigning them words to memorise and forget.
In many schools, literacy specialists meet with teachers in grade-level meetings to review 
assessment results, discuss grouping and plan for word study instruction. Many schools use spell-
ing inventory results as universal screening tools to help identify students who need intervention 
services. Spell checks and goal-setting/progress monitoring charts are then used to gauge how 
well students respond to classroom instruction and additional interventions. The end-of-grade-
level expectations chart in Table 2.4 can be useful in this regard. Often, spelling inventories are 
administered at all grade levels and each year the results are put in students’ permanent records 
and serve as an important part of the school’s cumulative literacy assessment. Next year’s teachers 
and specialists have access to these records and can use them to place students and plan instruction.
Assessing the Spelling  
Development of English Learners
To obtain a complete understanding of the word knowledge of students who are learning Eng-
lish, explore their literacy knowledge in their primary or first language. A spelling inventory in 
students’ spoken language can indicate their literacy levels in the primary language and more 
specifically, show which orthographic features they already understand. Words Their Way™ 
with English Learners discusses spelling development, assessment and instruction for English 
learners in depth (Helman, Bear, Templeton, Invernizzi & Johnston, 2012) and also provides 
inventories in several languages.
By assessing their orthographic knowledge using the assessments described in this chap-
ter, teachers can observe whether English learners are applying the rules of phonology and 
orthography from the written form of their primary language to English, or vice-versa (Hel-
man, 2004, 2010). Bilingual learners rely on knowledge of their primary language to spell 
words in a second language (Fashola, Drum, Mayer & Kang, 1996; Nathenson-Mejia, 1989; 
Shen & Bear, 2000; Yang, 2005; Zutell & Allan, 1988). For example, Spanish speakers take 
the 22 sounds of Spanish and match them to the roughly 44 sounds of English, making some 
logical substitutions along the way.

Predictable Spelling Confusions
Because students are expected to learn the orthography of English, it is useful to administer 
one of the inventories from Table 2.1 to see what they know and are ready to learn. The 
responses will also reveal some of the predictable confusions students may make. Bear et al. 
(2003) have identified which English consonant sounds are problematic for Spanish speakers, 
who make a variety of substitutions that can be traced to the influence of Spanish on their 
spelling. Examples include spelling that as DAT and ship as CHAP because the digraphs /th/ 
and /sh/ do not exist in Spanish. Because the silent h in Spanish can be spelled with a j, hot may 
be spelled JAT. Spellers use the nearest equivalents in their attempts to spell English. Short 
a, e, i and u do not occur in Spanish, and the sound we call short o is spelled with the letter 
a. We can expect many confusions about how to represent these short vowel sounds such as 
using A for the short o in hot.
The spelling sample of a second grader in Figure 2.11 shows how a student’s spoken 
Spanish can affect her English spelling. Several of Rosa’s attempts follow the logical substitu-
tions that are seen from English-speaking students in the letter name–alphabetic stage; that 
is, SHEP for ship and WAN for when. Other errors make good sense in relation to Spanish 
letter–sound correspondences. For example, given the pronunciation of a as /ah/ in Spanish, 
her spelling of SHAPEN for shopping is understandable. She replaces the ch in chewed with sh 
(SHOD). Rosa is also trying to find a spelling for the long i, shown by her use of AY in two of 
her spellings (bright as BRAYT and ripen as RAYPN). The long i—when elongated—really 
sounds like two vowels (“eye-ee”—a diphthong). Rosa is using the y, pronounced as a long e 
in Spanish, to spell the second half of the vowel combination.
The Influences of Students’ Primary Languages
As Rosa’s spelling illustrates, English learners’ spellings efforts are logical and interesting. As 
you listen to the speech and oral reading of English language learners, notice the influences of 
their first languages on pronunciation and look for spelling errors that may be explained by a 
primary language or dialect. For example, one teacher learned about the influence of different 
East Indian dialects when she noticed confusions of /p/ for f and /sh/ for s. Another teacher 
noted her Korean students consistently confusing r for l and vice-versa. In spoken Korean, 
/r/ and /l/ are not different sounds and are represented with the same letter in Hangul, the 
Korean writing system (Yang, 2005).
Through observing English learners’ native languages, teachers can better understand the 
literacy development in English. Look in each of the instructional chapters for specific guid-
ance on the interrelatedness of students’ home languages and English.
Conclusion
Looking at a child’s spelling gives us a window into that child’s word knowledge, the informa-
tion he or she uses to read and write words. The word assessment comes from the Latin word 
assidere—“to sit beside”. Spend some time sitting beside your students and looking through 
the window that their spellings provide and use inventories to assess what they know about 
how words work.
A summary of the developmental sequence can be found inside the front cover, and each 
of the instructional chapters for this book offers detailed information about the stage, the 
features to study, and activities to enhance instruction. Remember that the inventories only 
sample the most common features. At each stage, there is a considerable body of knowledge 
that students should master before they move on to the next stage. Keep your fingers on the 
pulse of development by monitoring progress over time using the spell checks and the goal-
setting/progress monitoring tools discussed in this chapter and available from the website. 
And always keep in mind the synchrony of literacy development—the heart of planning 
instruction—the topic for Chapter 3.

O
nce you determine the developmental level of each of your students, as described in 
Chapter 2, you are ready to organise your classroom for word study. In this chapter, 
we will describe the basic activities for word study, how to lead thoughtful word 
study discussions, how to create and organise materials and how to set up weekly routines that 
facilitate effective and efficient word study. We will address related issues such as expectations 
for editing and grading, before ending with a review of guiding principles of word study and 
a table of resources. To illustrate the details that make up this chapter, let’s first visit the class-
room of Mrs. Zimmerman as she introduces a group of her students to r-influenced vowels.
Earlier in the year, Mrs. Zimmerman assessed her third-grade students and divided them into 
three instructional groups for word study. On most Mondays, she meets with each group for 
about 15 to 20 minutes to go over the words and help her students make discoveries and 
reach conclusions about the particular group of words she has chosen. After getting her 
students started on independent reading and journal writing, Mrs. Zimmerman calls her first 
group to a table. She has a set of words cards laid out on a table. She begins by saying, “Let’s 
go over these words to be sure everyone knows how to read them and what they mean.” After 
discussing mare, which Julio defines as a “mother horse”, she picks up bear and bare and reads 
both. “Who remembers what words like these are called? That’s right, they’re homophones.” 
She holds up bear and asks who knows what it means.
“It’s an animal and I saw one last summer when we went camping,” offers Shannon.
“What about this bare?” asks Mrs. Zimmerman, as she holds up the word. Rayshad explains that it means “hav-
ing no hair, like being bald”.
“Any other ideas?” asks Mrs. Zimmerman, to which Jessie adds, “You might go barefooted, without shoes.”
Other examples are given and then Mrs. Zimmerman continues, “There is another set of homophones here. 
Can anyone find them?” Mason finds hair and hare and again they talk about the meaning of each. They recall that 
they have heard the word hare in the story The Hare and the Tortoise, which they read during a unit on fables.
Mrs. Zimmerman now moves into the heart of the lesson by using an open-ended question to get students 
thinking and observing, “What do you notice about our words for this week?” Rachel points out that all the words 
have A’s and Samuel adds that they also have Rs. “What else?” Mrs. Zimmerman probes, “Tell me more.” Tiffany 
­identifies the patterns of AR and AIR and Belle adds that there are also words with ARE. Mrs. Zimmerman responds, 
“So you are using your eyes to see how they are alike. What do your ears tell you? Julio?” Julio says that he can hear  
/ar/ and /air/. Mrs. Zimmerman affirms, “Yes, I hear those also. Does anyone hear any other sounds?”
Mrs. Zimmerman then begins a teacher-directed sort by setting up categories. “Let’s sort our words by sounds. 
I am going to put cart here as one of our key words and care over here for the other. Listen to the sounds in each: 
caaarrrt, caaarrrre.” Then she picks up and reads the word farm. “Will this go with cart or care? Farm and cart sound 
alike in the middle so we will put farm under cart. How about chair? Does it sound like cart or care in the middle?” 
After sorting several more words, Mrs. Zimmerman hands out the rest of the word cards and calls on students to 
read and sort each word by its vowel sound. After sorting all the words, the students read down each column to 
verify that the words all have the same sound in the middle. The final sort by sound looks like Figure 3.1.
Next, Mrs. Zimmerman directs her students’ attention to the spelling patterns: “When you look at these words 
what do you notice about all the words in each column?” Lisa replies that they all have an a and r in them. “Does

everyone see that pattern? What else?” she prompts. William volunteers that under 
care, there is an e at the end or an i in the middle. “Shall we put these words into two 
separate categories by spelling pattern?” asks Mrs. Zimmerman. “What should we use 
as headers?”  The students agree to keep care as one header and to use chair for the 
other, and these words are underlined. Mrs. ­Zimmerman passes out the word cards and 
students take turns placing each word under care or chair after reading it aloud.
“I have an oddball!” calls out Tan, and she places the word bear off to the right.
“Ahh,” says Mrs. Zimmerman. “Why is it an oddball?”
“It is the only “air” sound spelled with an EA,” explains Tan.
After sorting the words by pattern as shown in Figure 3.2, they read down each 
column of words to verify that they all have the same sound as well as the same pattern. 
Mrs. Zimmerman then asks her students if the patterns remind them of other words they 
have studied. Brian points out that ai and a with an e on the end are patterns that go 
with long a. “Are these long a words?” probes Mrs. Zimmerman. “Listen: caaaare, chaaair.” 
The children agree that they can hear the sound of /a/ in those words. “What do you 
notice about the a in cart?” asks Mrs. Zimmerman. This time there is some discussion as 
students come to the conclusion that they cannot even hear a vowel! Mrs. Zimmerman 
tells the students that over the next few weeks they will look at more words with an r 
after the vowel and they should watch how the r influences the sound of vowels. To end 
the lesson, Mrs. Zimmerman asks students to reflect on what they have learned and she records their summary: The 
sound “air” can be spelled two ways—air and are.
Before they return to their seats, Mrs. Zimmerman gives each student a handout for sorting independently. 
She reminds them to draw coloured lines down the back to mark their set of words and then underline the key 
words before cutting them apart. They are to sort first by sound (naming each word quietly as they sort) and then 
by pattern as they did in their final group sort. Two volunteers agree to illustrate the homophones for the class 
homophone dictionary.
After Mrs. Zimmerman meets with another word study group, she quickly checks in with each student in the first 
group to look at his or her sort. As she moves around the room, she asks individual students to read a column of words 
and explain how they are alike. On Tuesday, she will ask all her students to sort their words once more and then to write 
the words by categories in word study notebooks along with a sentence or two about what they have learned. On other 
days, they will work with partners to sort again and to find more words from the books they are reading that fit the 
same sounds and/or patterns. On Friday, Mrs. Zimmerman assesses all three 
groups at one time by calling out a word in turn for each group to spell.
This classroom vignette illustrates several key principles of developmental 
word study:
  1.  A step backward is a step forward. Students in this group had already 
studied the fairly consistent ar sound in words like car and star. In this 
sort, those sounds are reviewed and a new sound is introduced that is 
spelled with two different patterns.
  2.  Use words students can read. Mrs. Zimmerman began this lesson by 
going over the words, reading and discussing their meanings.
  3.  Sort by sound and pattern. Mrs. Zimmerman began by comparing two 
sounds before leading a visual sort in which spelling patterns were 
compared. Even when students sort by pattern it is important for 
them to “say it” as they “lay it”.

The Role of Word Sorting
Throughout this book you will see many examples of games and activities, but the simple 
process of sorting words into categories, like the word sort described in Mrs. Zimmer-
man’s class, is the heart of word study. Categorising is a fundamental way that humans 
make sense of the world. It allows us to find order and similarities among various objects, 
events, ideas and words that we encounter. When students sort words, they engage in the 
active process of searching, comparing, contrasting and analysing. Word sorts help students 
organise what they know about words and form generalisations that they can then apply to 
new words they encounter in their reading or spell in their writing (Gillet & Kita, 1979; 
Henderson, 1990).
Because sorting is such a powerful way to help students make sense of words, we will 
take some time here to discuss it in depth. We recommend this same categorisation routine 
for students in all stages studying a variety of word features. At first, emergent and begin-
ning readers learn to pay attention to sounds at the beginnings of words by sorting pictures 
(­Figure 3.3). By the time they are transitional readers, enjoying their first Frog and Toad books 
(by A. Lobel), students benefit from sorting written words by vowel sounds and vowel pat-
terns. In later grades, students enhance their spelling and 
vocabulary through sorting words by prefixes and suffixes. 
In middle school and high school, students sort words by 
Greek and Latin roots that share common meanings. As 
children progress in word knowledge, they learn how to 
look at and think about words in different ways.
Teaching New Word Knowledge  
through Sorting
Word sorting offers the best of both constructivist learning 
and teacher-directed instruction. Begin by “stacking the 
deck” with words that can be contrasted by sound, pattern 
or meaning. During sorting, Mrs. Zimmerman’s students 
will discover generalisations about how the English spelling 
system works. Over the next few weeks, they will continue 
to explore r-influenced vowels through a series of sorts and 
will discover that r often “robs” the vowel of the sounds we 
normally associate with it. Rather than simply memorising 
20 words each week for a spelling test, students have the 
opportunity to construct their own word knowledge that 
they can apply to reading and writing. Through sorting, 
students acquire and integrate new word knowledge that 
is extended and refined through the activities we describe. 
In addition to learning how to spell, read, understand and 
use new words, students develop productive habits of mind 
(Marzano, 1992).
4.	 Don’t hide exceptions. In this sort, the word bear was included as an oddball, a word that has the same sound 
but a different spelling pattern. Words like pear and wear might have been included as well. These so-called 
exceptions reveal that there is a small subset of words with the /air/ sound spelled with an ear pattern.
5.	 Teaching is not telling. Mrs. Zimmerman is careful to use open-ended questions so that students have the oppor-
tunity to draw their own conclusions about the set of words. She expects her students to do the thinking for 
themselves with guidance from her as needed. ●

Teaching Phonics through Sorting
One central goal of word study is to teach students how to spell and decode new words and to 
improve their word recognition speed in general. To accomplish this goal, we teach students 
how to examine words to learn the regularities that exist in the spelling system. Picture sorts 
and word sorts are designed to help students learn how and where to look at and listen to 
words.
Picture and word sorting differ from other phonics approaches in some important ways. 
First, word sorts are interesting and fun for students because they are hands-on and manipu-
lative. The process of sorting requires students to pay attention to words and to make logi-
cal decisions as they place each one in a column. Consider the ancient proverb: “I hear and 
I ­forget, I see and I remember, I do and I understand.” Word sorts help students learn by doing 
(Morris, 2013).
Second, students work with words or the names of pictures that they can already pro-
nounce. In this way, processing words from the known to the unknown while sorting through 
a set of cards, children concentrate on analysing the sounds or patterns within each word. 
This is not possible if students cannot first name the words. Because learning to spell involves 
associating the spelling of words and their pronunciations, it is important that children know 
and can already pronounce most of the words to be sorted.
A third way in which sorting differs from some other phonics approaches is that sorting 
is analytic, whereas many phonics programmes take a synthetic approach. In both approaches, 
students are taught letter–sound correspondences. However, in a synthetic phonics 
approach, students are taught the letter-sound correspondences and then expected to sound 
out words phoneme by phoneme. This can make reading tedious and can detract from mean-
ing and engagement. An analytic phonics approach uses known words; students are asked 
to examine their parts listening for sounds, looking for patterns or thinking about meaning. 
Analytic ­phonics supports the synthetic skills necessary to decode new words when reading 
and to encode words when writing.
A fourth way in which sorting differs from most phonics and spelling programmes is that 
sorting does not rely on memorising or reciting rules prior to understanding the underlying 
principles. During sorting, students determine similarities and differences among features as 
they use higher-level critical thinking skills to make categorical judgements. When students 
make decisions about whether the middle vowel sound in cat sounds more like the medial 
vowel sound in map or top, independent analysis and judgement are required. Memorisation is 
necessary to master the English spelling system. One simply must remember that the animal 
is spelled bear and the adjective is spelled bare, but memorisation is easier when served by 
knowledge and understanding of the principles of English spelling. Likewise, rules are useful 
mnemonics for concepts already understood.
Finally, because of the simplicity of sorting routines, teachers find it easier to differenti-
ate instruction among groups of learners. Sorting is infinitely adaptable and the process of 
categorising word features lends itself to cooperative learning.
Types of Sorts
The three basic types of sorts reflect the three layers of English orthography: sound, pattern 
and meaning. There are many variations of these sorts that students can do under your direc-
tion, with a partner or by themselves for additional practice.
Sound Sorts
Sound is the first layer of English orthography that students must negotiate to make sense 
of the alphabetic nature of English spelling. At different points in development, students sort  

	
 Organising for Word Study	
77
words by rhyme, initial sounds, consonant blends or digraphs, rhyming word families or 
vowel sounds. Advanced spellers may sort by unaccented syllables, the number of syllables 
and ­syllable stress.
Pictures are naturally suited for sound sorts: the picture begs to be named, yet there 
is no printed form of the word for reference. As students sort each picture, they must pay 
attention to the sounds or phonemes contained in the word. Picture sorting is particularly 
suited for students who are still developing phonemic awareness and do not have extensive 
reading vocabularies. Students say the names of the pictures as they place under the letters 
and key pictures associated with the initial sound. Refer to Figure 3.3. For variety, small 
objects can be used instead of pictures, like a penny, pencil and pin for sorting by begin-
ning /p/ sound. English learners will need extra time and support to learn the names of 
the objects and pictures before sorting them by sound. Printed words, too, can be sorted 
for sound, as Mrs. Zimmerman did using the key words cart and care. Because sound is the 
first aspect of a word that a speller has for reference, sound sorts are very important. For 
example, only after the long a in tape is identified can the speller consider which of several 
spelling patterns might be used. (Is it taip or tape?) Not all word sorts involve a sound con-
trast, but many do.
Pattern Sorts
Students use the printed form of the word to sort by visual patterns or letter sequences. Let-
ter name–alphabetic spellers sort words into word families (hat, rat, pat versus ran, fan, tan). 
Students in the within word pattern stage sort their words into groups by vowel patterns 
(wait, train, mail, pain versus plate, take, blame). More advanced spellers will sort by the pat-
tern of consonants and vowels at the syllable juncture (button, pillow, ribbon versus window, 
public, basket) or by patterns of constancy and change across derivationally related words (e.g., 
divine–divinity, mental–mentality).
Pattern sorts often follow a sound sort as we saw in the lesson with Mrs. Zimmerman. 
The words under care were subdivided into two pattern groups: words spelled with air and 
words spelled with are. Because certain patterns go with certain sound categories, students 
must be taught first to listen for the sound and then to consider alternative ways to spell that 
sound.
Sometimes a new feature is best introduced with a pattern sort to reveal a related sound 
difference. Consider the words in Figure 3.4 that have been sorted by the final ch or tch pat-
tern. The final sound in all the words is the same, so a sound sort would not 
help to differentiate their spellings. However, now that the words are sorted 
by the final consonant patterns, read down each column to see if you notice 
anything about the vowel sounds within each column. What did you discover? 
The tch pattern is associated with the short vowel sound whereas ch is associ-
ated with the long vowel sound. Exceptions are rich and such, which are moved 
to the oddball category. The visual patterns of words are best remembered 
when associated with categories of sound.
Word sorts with printed word cards are the mainstay of pattern sorts and 
are useful for all students who have a functional sight word vocabulary. Key 
words containing the pattern under study may be underlined or bolded (as in 
Figure 3.6) to label each category. Students sort word cards by matching the 
pattern in each word to the pattern in the key word at the top of the column. 
Headers are used to highlight the recurring pattern (as shown in Figure 3.6, 
where tch and ch label the feature of interest). Students can sometimes create 
their own headers as part of the word sorting lesson to summarise a generalisa-
tion. Because it is easier to sort words by visual pattern, students can lose sight 
of the fact that certain patterns go with certain sounds. Sometimes mixing a 
few pictures in with a stack of word cards challenges students to be vigilant in 
their word analysis.

Meaning Sorts
Sometimes the focus of a sort is on meaning. The two major types of 
meaning sorts are concept sorts and meaning sorts related to spelling.
Concept Sorts.  Sorting objects, pictures or words by concepts 
or meaning is a good way to link vocabulary instruction to students’ 
conceptual understanding. Concept sorts are appropriate for all ages 
and stages of word knowledge, and should be used regularly in the 
content areas. Pictures of mammals, mathematical formulas, geometric 
shapes or social studies vocabulary words all can be sorted for greater 
understanding. The creative possibilities for using concept sorts are 
endless. As writing tools, they can be used to organise ideas before 
composing. Concept sorts are even useful for teaching grammar when 
words are sorted by parts of speech.
You can use concept sorts for assessing and building background 
knowledge before embarking on a new unit of study. For example, a sci-
ence unit on states of matter might begin by having students categorise 
the following words into groups that go together: steam, wood, air, ice cube, 
rain, metal, glue, paint, plastic, smoke, milk and fog. Discussing the reasons 
behind their conceptual groupings will be the most revealing. Revisit the 
sort as the unit progresses to review and assess core concepts and vocabulary. Having students 
categorise examples under the key words solid, liquid and gas will help them sort out the essential 
characteristics for each state of matter. Concept sorts are effective for dealing with new words 
in novels, too. While reading Stuart Little (by E. B. White), a group of Mrs. Birckhead’s third-
graders sorted some of the vocabulary they encountered, as shown in Figure 3.5.
Concept picture sorts are particularly beneficial for English learners. Without knowing 
the English labels, they can sort pictures of a dog, a cat, a duck and so on into an animal cat-
egory. These can be contrasted with pictures of a flower, a tree, a cornfield, a pumpkin and so 
on—all examples of plants. English vocabulary is learned as students repeat the sort, naming 
each picture and category with help from a teacher or peer.
Spelling–Meaning Sorts.  Students see that meaning influences the spelling of 
words when they first encounter soundalike homophone pairs like by and buy or to and too. 
Students enjoy homophones because they are interesting, and it makes sense that words with 
different meanings take different spelling patterns. When you teach homophones through 
word sorting, students expand their vocabularies and learn about spelling patterns at the same 
time, as demonstrated by the discussion of bear and bare in Mrs. Zimmerman’s class. Homo-
graphs are words that are spelled the same but pronounced differently, depending on part of 
speech: We record our sorts so that we have an ongoing record of them. By sorting homographs 
into grammatical categories by part of speech, students enrich their vocabularies while learn-
ing how to pay attention to syllable stress.
Advanced spellers learn how words that are related in meaning often share similar spell-
ings. This spelling–meaning connection in derivationally related words provides a rich arena 
for meaning sorts that build on Greek and Latin elements. Spellers who are learning deriva-
tional relations will sort words by similarities in roots and stems such as the spect in spectator, 
spectacle, inspect and spectacular versus the port in transport, import, portable and port-o-john.
A Continuum of Support when Introducing Sorts
Instruction in word study, as in comprehension and other areas of the curriculum, should 
follow a gradual release model (Fisher & Frey, 2008) that begins with teacher modelling and 
explicit explanations (Duffy, 2009), moves to guided practice, and then proceeds to indepen-
dent work. Each week, students get a new set of words to work with and you need to decide

how best to introduce those words so that students are led to form generalisations about how 
a feature works. Introductory lessons can range from teacher-directed sorts to student-centred 
sorts done independently. Which level of support you select depends on several factors:
1.	 How familiar students are with the sorting process
2.	 Whether a new feature is being introduced
3.	 The amount of time available for sorting
4.	 How well students can work independently
Different levels of support are summarised in Table 3.1 and described in the following 
subsections, but the infinite variations of these allow you to adapt word sorting to your own 
tastes and situation. Open-ended questions that require students to do their own thinking and 
form their own generalisations are used at all levels, but you should always be ready to model 
your own thinking when they are unable to articulate a generalisation.
Mrs. Zimmerman chose a teacher-directed sort to introduce the new feature of r-influenced 
vowels in the vignette at the beginning of this chapter. Such a lesson can take 20 minutes or 
more. The next week when she gives them words with er, ear and eer, she might ask students 
to sort the words on their own before coming to the group because she knows that they are 
experienced sorters who will be thinking about sounds and patterns as they sort. She may only 
need five to ten minutes of group time in which the students quickly re-sort their words, check 
the sort and reflect on what they discovered.
Teacher-Directed Closed Sorts
The highest level of support and explicit instruction is offered in teacher-directed closed 
sorts. Define the categories in advance using key words and/or headers and make it clear 
how to conduct the sort (Gillet & Kita, 1979). For example, in a beginning sound phonics 
sort, isolate the beginning sound to be taught and make an explicit connection to the letter 
that represents it using a key word to designate the category. You might think aloud like this: 
“Shhhhhoe, shhhhell. I hear the same sound at the beginning of shoe and shell, so I am going 
to put the picture of the shell under shoe. They both begin with /sh/, the sound made by the 
letters s–h.”
After modelling several words this way, gradually release the task to the students’ control 
as they finish the sort under your supervision. After sorting, students discuss the characteris-
tics of the words in each column and develop a generalisation based on the selected feature. 
Students may then sort independently or collaboratively in pairs under your guidance. This 
practice is carefully monitored and corrective feedback is provided.
The teacher-directed sort is the most commonly used approach to introduce a new sort 
to a group, providing a model of direct instruction that is explicit and systematic, yet sensitive 
to individual variation. The teacher-directed lesson plan includes three components: demon-
strate and sort, check and reflect and extend.
Demonstrate and Sort.  There are four steps to introducing the sort using key 
pictures or words.
1.	 Review the words. Look over the words or pictures for items that are potentially difficult to 
identify or that may be unfamiliar to students. Give names of pictures as needed. (“This 
is a picture of a yard.”) Students should already be able to read most of the words in a 
sort but any words students cannot identify should be set aside until later. Help students 
define unfamiliar words and words with multiple meanings, and use them in sentences. 
(“Does anyone know what a hutch is? It is a kind of wooden cage up on legs. Pet rabbits 
often live in hutches.”) You might keep dictionaries handy and ask students to look up 
selected words and report back to the group. (“A hutch is a pen for animals but also a 
piece of furniture.”) Supply pictures when possible to develop new meanings and revisit 
vocabulary throughout the week. Your English learners will especially benefit from pic-
ture dictionaries and a vocabulary discussion.

2.	 Establish the categories. Use open-ended questions such as “What do you notice about these 
words?” or “How might we sort these words?” to get students thinking about categories. If 
you stacked the deck with words that share common patterns or sounds and your students 
are familiar with categorising, they should notice common features fairly quickly. If not, then 
define the categories for them. Introduce letter cards, key pictures, key words or headers with 
pattern cues to indicate the categories. If you are working with sounds, you can emphasise or 
elongate them by stretching them out. If you are working with patterns, you can think aloud 
as you point out the spelling pattern. If you are working with syllables, affixes or derivational 
relations, you can explicitly point out the unit you are using to compare and contrast.
3.	 Model several words into each category and explain why you are sorting. “We are going to listen 
for the vowel sound in the middle of these words and decide if they sound like map or like 
duck. I’ll do a few first. Here is a rug. Ruuuuug, uuuug, uuuuuuh. Notice how I peel off 
the sounds before and after the vowel to make it easier to hear the vowel in the middle. 
Rug has the ‘uh’ sound (/u˘/ ) in the middle, so I’ll put it under duck, uuuuck, uuuuh. Here 
is a flag. Flaaaaag, aaaag, aaaa. I’ll put flag under maaaap. Flag and map both have the /a˘/ 
sound in the middle; the /a˘/ sound is made by the vowel letter a.”
4.	 Turn the task over to students to finish the sort. Display the rest of the pictures or words, pass 
them out or continue to hold them up one at a time. Students can take turns and enjoy the 
anticipation of turning over a word in the stack. Students should name the picture or read 
the word aloud and then place it in a category, explaining why it goes there. If students 
make a mistake at the very beginning, correct it immediately. Simply say: “Sack would go 
under map. Its middle sound is /a˘/.” Then model how to segment the phonemes to isolate 
the medial vowel: /s/–/a˘/–/k/.
Check and Reflect
You may ask students to sort their own set of words cooperatively or independently under 
your supervision. Unless your students are in the last two levels of word knowledge (syllables 
and affixes or derivational relations), ask them to name each word or picture aloud as they sort. 
If someone does not know what to call a picture, tell the student immediately. If someone can-
not read a word, lay the card aside to consider later. Model how to check the sort by reading 
down each column to listen for sound or look for the pattern. Oddballs may be discussed at 
this point and you may move to the reflection portion of the lesson.
During this second, repeated sort, do not correct your students, but when they are 
through, have them name the words or pictures in each column to check themselves. When 
students make mistakes it is sometimes useful to find out why they sorted a picture or word in 
a particular way. Simply asking, “Why did you put that there?” can provide further insight into 
a student’s word knowledge. If mistakes are made during the second sort, your students will 
learn more if you guide them to finding and correcting the mistake on their own. You might 
say, “I see one word in this column that doesn’t fit.”
After checking their work, students reflect on why they sorted the way they did. It is 
important to have students verbalise what the words or pictures in each column have in com-
mon. The best way to initiate such a discussion is to say, “What do you notice about the words 
in each column?” Guide them to consider sound, pattern and meaning with questions such as, 
“How are the sounds in these words alike? What kind of pattern do you notice? Are any of 
these words similar in meaning?” Avoid telling rules, but help students shape their ideas into 
generalisations, such as, “All of these words have the letter u in the middle and make the ‘uh’ 
sound,” or “The words with an e on the end have the /a-/ sound in the middle.” Be sure to talk 
about why the oddballs are placed in another category and return to any words that students 
were not able to read. With the generalisation or “big idea” now stated they may be able to 
apply it to the decoding of unfamiliar words. During the reflection part of the lesson, students 
are asked to declare their knowledge about sound, pattern and meaning.
Extend.  After the group demonstration, sorting and reflection, students participate in a 
number of activities at centres, with partners, as seatwork, and for homework to reinforce and

extend their understanding. They continue to sort a number of times individually and with 
partners for several days. They hunt for similar words, draw and label pictures, add to word 
charts, complete word study notebooks and play games. Extensions are described in more 
detail later in this chapter.
Guess My Category: A Teacher-Directed Sort
When students are comfortable with sorts, you can introduce any new area of study with a 
collection of objects, words or pictures in a variation of the teacher-directed sort called Guess 
My Category. After reviewing the words, set up key words or pictures as in a closed sort but do 
not offer any explanation of the categories. Rather, it is your students’ job to develop hypoth-
eses about how the things in each category are alike. Begin by sorting two or three pictures or 
words into each group. When you pick up the next picture or word, invite someone to guess 
where it will go. Continue doing this until all the pictures or words have been sorted. Try to 
keep the students who have caught on to the attributes of interest from telling the others until 
the end. Look at the words below sorted under the key words dead, street and reach. Can you 
guess the categories and decide where to sort speak, bread and sweet?
After sorting, check the sort, and guide a reflection as you would for the teacher-directed 
sort above. Students get their own words to sort and are assigned follow-up activities to do 
throughout the week.
Guess My Category is particularly useful in small groups for exploring content-specific 
vocabulary while also stimulating creative thinking. Give small groups sets of words, pictures 
or objects that might be grouped in various ways; ask each group to come up 
with its own categories. Allow them to have a miscellaneous designation for those 
things that do not fit the categories they establish. After the groups are finished 
working, let them visit each other’s sorts and try to guess the categories that were 
used. For example, pictures of animals might be sorted into groups according to 
body covering, habitat or number of legs.
Student-Centred Sorts
As students become sorting pros, student-centred sorts increase the cognitive 
demand and can reduce the amount of teacher-directed group time. In many 
classrooms, students are given their words for the week on Monday morning, 
and they sort their words independently in anticipation of the categories they will 
be sorting later in teacher-directed groups. The handout for a closed sort, such 
as the example in Figure 3.6, provides the headers and key words students need 
to complete the sort on their own. They have some support, but must still read 
each word and think about sounds and patterns as they make their own decisions 
about where to sort. Remind students to watch out for oddballs. Oddballs present 
an enjoyable challenge for students that forces them to test the hypotheses they 
form about the words.

given any clues to the categories or features—only a set of words to sort. 
Open sorts are often the most satisfying for students as well because they 
present a puzzle to solve. Distribute a handout that has no headers or key 
words, such as Figure 3.7, and ask students to create their own categories. 
(If you are using prepared sorts that come with headers and key words, as in 
Figure 3.6, cut off the headers and key words to save for later.) Students can 
be asked to compare their categories with a partner to begin the reflection 
part of the lesson and come up with their own generalisations before sharing 
with the larger group.
Even with student-centred sorts you should still meet with the students indi-
vidually or in a group to discuss the sort and check it for accuracy as described 
previously. In the case of an open sort, you may find that some students have 
sorted the words in ways that do not reveal a generalisation or the “big idea”. 
For example, your students may sort the words in Figure 3.7 by the number of 
letters, by rhyming words or by beginning consonants (with a blend or no blend). 
After acknowledging that the words could be sorted that way, you should “close 
the sort” by agreeing on categories. At this point you might give students the 
headers and key words that were cut off the handout, or have students create their 
own headers as a way for them to summarise the features as part of the reflection 
process. In the final sort (see Figure 3.4 on page 77), the tch and ch endings have 
been underlined to identify both key words and headers. The same headers should be used 
each time students sort.
Student-centred sorts are diagnostic in nature because they reveal what students know 
when they work independently. Open sorts provide opportunities for students to test their 
own hypotheses and they often come up with unexpected ways to organise words. These open 
sorts are interesting to observe and to discover what students already understand or misun-
derstand. Some of the most productive discussions about orthography come when students 
explain why they sorted the way they did in an open sort.
Teacher Talk and Student Reflection
Peter Johnston has written extensively about how the language teachers use with students 
can position them as problem solvers or passive recipients (2004, 2012). Word study, as we 
describe it, offers valuable opportunities for students to be actively involved in making dis-
coveries about the spelling system and developing vocabulary—but only if teachers facilitate 
group discussions that foster thoughtful interactions (Gehsmann, Millwood & Bear, 2012). 
Ganske and Jocius (2013) reported that teachers they observed often relied on a traditional 
initiate/respond/evaluate format during word study lessons. The teacher initiates a question to 
which he or she knows the answer, the student responds and the teacher evaluates the response 
as right or wrong. Such interactions are more like interrogations dominated by the teacher 
than discussions in which students practise higher-level thinking skills and learn from each 
other.
Student reflection and discussion are critical parts of word study instruction, but teach-
ers must carefully consider how it is done. The language we use when we talk with students 
has a powerful influence on their understanding and can cultivate a sense of self-efficacy and 
problem solving. Asking open-ended questions such as, “What do you notice about these 
words?” suggests there are multiple aspects of words worth considering and that there is no 
one right answer. When students are writing and ask how to spell a word, asking, “Do you 
know another word that has a similar sound at the beginning?” conveys the message that they 
can figure it out for themselves (Johnston, 2004). Table 3.2 presents examples of teacher talk 
that encourages students to use language in problem solving, to reason and reflect and to apply 
their growing word knowledge to other words.
Try to frame your response to their answers in ways that avoid judgement and will further 
the discussion. Instead of saying “Right” or “Good job”, try, “Who agrees? Why?” or “Who 
can add to that?” When you say, “I like your ideas” or “Who can add to Todd’s comment?”

you are giving students credit for their thinking rather than congratulating them on coming 
up with the answer you wanted to hear.
Questions such as these can help you get meaningful conversations about words going 
in your classroom and help to cultivate strategies for problem solving and reflection. Include 
talk about position, frequency and related words. Some spelling patterns are found at the ends 
of words (like the oy in toy and enjoy) and others in the middle (like the oi in soil or choice). By 
asking students to reflect on where certain patterns occur within words, you can lead students 
to consider position as they learn to read and spell. Frequency of occurrence is also worthy of 
reflection. For example, word hunts will reveal that words ending in er are much more com-
mon than words ending in or or ar. Once students are clued into the frequency of certain spell-
ing patterns, they can apply this insight by using a “best bet” approach to spelling and reading 
unfamiliar words. Reflecting on related words will extend students’ insights to other words—a 
major goal of word study. Words with similar roots and affixes are related in both spelling and 
meaning. For example, the word cover is related to discover, uncover, recover, discovery, recovery 
and so on. Such is the generative nature of word study.

Extensions and Follow-Up Routines
After an introductory sort, assign students a variety of follow-up activities designed to rein-
force generalisations and their memory of words, build speed and accuracy and connect to 
reading and writing. Ideally, such activities develop productive habits of looking for and think-
ing about word attributes, while at the same time providing individual practice and experience 
manipulating and categorising words. All of these activities can and should be introduced to 
the whole class through modelling before assigning them to be completed independently.
Repeated Sorts
To become fluent readers and writers, students must achieve automaticity in reading (Samuels, 
1988), the fast and accurate recognition of words in context, and automaticity in writing to 
produce fast and accurate spellings. The words they encounter in context and use in writing 
are made of the same sounds, patterns and meaning units they examine out of context in 
word study. One of the best ways to achieve automaticity in word recognition and spelling is 
to repeat a picture or word sort over several days. In Mrs. Zimmerman’s class, students sort 
individually after the group lesson, again on Tuesday, and then on Wednesday with partners. 
They eagerly participate in timed or speed sorts and they are expected to take their words 
home to sort several days a week for homework. All this adds up to sorting the same words six 
to eight times throughout the week.
Buddy Sorts
Students love to work cooperatively. In a buddy sort, they work together to read the words 
or name the pictures in each column, place the words into categories, check the sort and then 
talk to each other about the generalisation covered by the sort. The sorting can take place in 
tandem, side by side with two sets of words or alternating turns with one set of words. Buddy 
sorts can provide support for students who are not sure of how to name pictures (often the 
case for English learners) or read words. Two sorts that work well with buddies are blind sorts 
and blind writing sorts.
Blind Sorts
In a blind sort, headers or key words are used to establish categories, but then the teacher or 
a partner shuffles the word cards and calls each word aloud without showing it. The student 
indicates the correct category by pointing to or naming the header. The response is checked 
and corrected immediately when the printed word is revealed and put in place. Buddies can 
switch roles (reader or sorter) after going through the whole set of words or they can switch 
roles word by word. This sort is important for students who need to attend less to visual pat-
terns and more to the sounds. Sometimes, you can use a blind sort as a way to introduce a 
sort when sound is particularly important, as in the study of short vowels. Note, however, that 
blind sorts do not present a challenge when sound is not an issue, as in the study of prefixes 
or root words.
Writing Sorts
Writing words as a study technique for spelling is well established. Undoubtedly the motoric 
act reinforces the memory for associating letters and patterns with sounds and meanings. 
However, the practice of assigning students to write words five or more times is of little value 
because it can become mindless copying. Where there is no thinking, there is no learning. 
Writing words into categories demands that students attend to the sounds or patterns of let-
ters and think about how those characteristics correspond with the key word or header at the 
top of the column.
for English Learners

	 86	
C HAP TER 3
Start a writing sort by writing headers or key words 
for each category at the top of a paper. Students can 
record a sort that they complete with word cards or by 
turning over one word at a time from their collection and 
writing it under the correct header. Figure 3.8 shows how 
the words from a long a sort have been written under the 
key words came, clay and rain. Students can also be asked 
to write a reflection about what they have learned from 
the sort.
Blind Writing Sorts
A combination of the blind sort and writing sort, a blind 
writing sort requires students to write each word in the 
correct category before seeing the word. In a blind writing 
sort, students must rely on the sounds they hear in the word 
as well as their memory for the letters associated with them, cued by the key word at the top 
of the column. This is what spelling is all about. Blind writing sorts are an established weekly 
routine in many classrooms once students have had the chance to practise the sort several 
times. Some teachers conduct them in a group using the document camera or interactive 
whiteboard, saying the word aloud and letting the students write it before they reveal the 
word for checking. Blind writing sorts done with a buddy or for homework are a good way 
to prepare for a weekly test by identifying which words need more attention. Partners take 
turns calling the words aloud for each other to write. It is important to immediately show the 
word to check the spelling and placement after each word is written. Writing sorts are also an 
instructionally sound way to construct spelling tests. Key words are written and then students 
write and sort the words as they are called.
Speed Sorts
Students are highly motivated to practise their sorts to prepare for speed sorts. The easiest 
way to do speed sorts is a quick whole-class activity. Display a timer (laying a tablet or phone 
with a timer on a document camera is one way) or simply call the seconds aloud from the 
classroom clock. Students set up their headers, shuffle the rest of their words, then hold up 
the words to signal that they are ready (students in different groups will have different words). 
When you say “go”, everyone begins to sort. As they finish, students record their times. After 
checking, the speed sort can be repeated immediately as well as on other days so students can 
attempt to beat their own times. To encourage accurate sorting, seconds may be added for 
incorrectly placed words.
Students can also be paired to time each other using a stopwatch and chart their prog-
ress over time. Partners then check for correctness using an answer sheet. We do not recom-
mend pitting students against each other in a competitive mode, however; instead, students 
should compare their speeds with their own earlier speeds and work towards individual 
improvement.
Word Hunts
Students do not automatically see the relationship between spelling words and reading words. 
Word hunts help them make this important connection. In word hunts, students hunt 
through their reading and writing for words that are additional examples of the sound, pat-
tern or meaning unit they are studying and can develop an understanding of how many other 
words have the same feature. For example, they see many short a words, or that le is much 
more common at the ends of words than el. Some patterns are found in virtually every text 
again and again, whereas others are harder to find; thus, word hunts are more appropriate for 
Figure 3.8  Word Study Notebook

87
some features than others. Before students are expected to do word 
hunts, you should model the activity.
Modelling and Recording Word Hunts.  Start with 
a portion of text projected onto a whiteboard, a big book or simply a 
book being used for instruction. Working line by line, demonstrate 
how to locate words that fit the categories under study and how to 
record those words into categories. Then, assign students to look in 
familiar texts for other words that contain the same features. Add 
these words to written sorts under the corresponding key word. See 
­Figure 3.8 for words added to the long a categories at the bottom of 
the notebook page. Ask the students to use familiar books or already-
read portions of the books they are currently reading so they do not 
confuse skimming for words with reading for ­meaning.
Figure 3.9 shows an example of a word hunt conducted on a retelling 
of The Three Billy Goats Gruff by a group of students in Mrs. Fitzgerald’s 
third-grade class. After working with the long o and short o in word study, 
students found more words that she underlined. Then, they organised the 
words by sound and patterns and recorded them in their word study note-
books. Three words, including gobble, were added to the short o column. 
Groaned and goat were added to the oa column, home to the o–consonant–
e column and meadow was added to the ow column. A new pattern of open, 
single long o spellings was discovered with so, go and over. Students debated 
where to put too and who before classifying them as oddballs.
This word hunt in The Three Billy Goats Gruff retelling added more examples for students 
to consider and created new categories. Word hunts connect word study to other literacy 
contexts and can also extend the reach to more difficult vocabulary such as meadow and gobble. 
With these words, students are able to generalise the pattern within one-syllable words to 
two-syllable words. Word hunts thus provide a step up in word power.
Conducting Word Hunts.  Word hunts can be conducted in small groups, with 
partners or individually for seatwork or homework. Figure 3.10 shows students gathered 
around a large sheet of paper on which key words have been written. Students skim and 
scan pages of books that they have already read, looking for words that match the key words 
according to the feature under study. Discussion may ensue as to whether a word contains 
the spelling feature in question and sometimes students consult the dictionary, particularly to 
resolve questions of stress, syllabication or meaning.
When conducting word hunts with emergent to 
beginning readers, have students scan texts that are 
guaranteed to contain the phonics features targeted in 
their search. Many core reading programmes provide 
phonics or decodable readers, which are simple 
books organised around specific phonics features that 
repeat in the text. Other publishers offer phonics read-
ers such as the Ready Readers by Pearson Learning 
Group or the Learn to Read series by Starfall. Phonics 
readers can also be downloaded from websites such as 
Reading A-Z. Although such controlled texts may not 
be the heart of your reading programme, they offer 
beginning readers a chance to put into practice what 
they are learning about words and to see many words 
that work the same way. Simple poems and jingles such 
as those in I Saw You in the Bathtub, And Other Folk 
Rhymes (Schwartz & Hoff, 1991) also contain recurring 
sounds and patterns in their rhyme scheme.

Brainstorming
Although word hunts in text can extend the number of examples to consider, students may 
also supply additional examples through brainstorming. Brainstorming might be considered 
a word hunt through one’s own memory. You may want to ask for more words that rhyme 
with cat, words that describe people ending in er, or words that have spir as a root. Word hunts 
in current reading materials are not always productive when it comes to some features. For 
example, it is unlikely that a word hunt would turn up many words with the Latin root spir, 
but students may be able to brainstorm derived words they already know, such as inspire or 
perspire. Words brainstormed by students can be added to established categories listed on the 
board, a chart or a word study notebook.
Brainstorming can also be used to introduce a sort. You might ask students for words that 
have particular sounds, patterns or roots and write them on the board. You can then write 
words in categories as they are given, as in a Guess My Category sort, or categories might be 
determined by discussion. These words can be transferred to word study sheets for weekly 
word sorting routines. After one student raised a question about why the word sleeve had 
an e on the end when it already had the ee pattern, Mrs. Zimmerman asked her students to 
think of other words that ended in either ve or v. After listing their brainstormed words on 
the board, students sorted them into two groups—those that 
had a long vowel sound and needed the e to mark the vowel 
(stove, alive, cave) and those that did not (give, love, achieve). 
Students could think of no words that ended in plain v, and 
they concluded that an e always came after v, whether it was 
needed to mark the vowel or not.
Draw and Label/Cut and Paste
Draw and label is a good activity at a variety of levels to dem-
onstrate the meanings of words. See the second page of the 
word study notebook in ­Figure 3.8 (page 86) for an example. 
Multiple meanings for words like block can be illustrated 
(e.g., as a toy, a section of a neighbourhood and a sports play). 
Homophones like bear and bare are made more memorable 
through drawings, and creating an ongoing class homophone 
book, as shown in Figure  3.11, is a popular activity. Even 
advanced spellers in the derivational relations stage enjoy 
drawing pictures to illustrate the meanings of words like 
spectacles, ­spectators and inspector. 
Drawing pictures of additional words that start with a particular sound is 
a good activity for emergent and letter name–alphabet spellers. Provide paper 
that is divided into columns headed by a key letter (see Figure 3.12) so that 
students can see where to draw, how big to draw and how many to draw. It 
helps to begin by asking students to brainstorm other words before assigning 
them the drawing task. They might even look through alphabet books for 
ideas. After drawing pictures under the appropriate key letter, ask students 
to label the picture–spelling as best they can. Hold students accountable for 
spelling the initial sound correctly, but encourage them to try the rest of the 
word as well.
A variation of draw and label, the cut and paste ­activity is like a word hunt 
using pictures instead of written words, making it appropriate for emergent 
and letter name–­alphabetic spellers. Students hunt through old catalogues and 
magazines for pictures beginning with a certain sound and then cut out the 
pictures to paste them in the appropriate column.
Many teachers have their students paste words or pictures from a sort 
into the correct categories as a culminating activity. When using pictures, the

students are expected to label them spelling as best they can; the results 
can be used for assessment. See an example in Figure 3.13.
Alternative Sorts
Skilled reading requires attention to many aspects of written words 
simultaneously. Some students have a hard time attending flexibly 
to multiple features of words, often focusing exclusively on either 
sound or the visual patterns. These students often lack the insight 
that words represent more than just pronunciations; they have a 
difficult time grasping the idea that words have both meaning and 
sound (­Cartwright, 2010). To lessen this difficulty, students can be 
challenged to sort their words a different way as an added activity. 
For example, they might sort pictures by living and nonliving things, 
whether you would find them inside or outside, whether you could 
hold them in your hand, or things people can make or not make. 
Words intended for a short vowel sort might also be sorted by blends 
at the beginning or end. Other alternative categories are parts of 
speech, or words that show action or objects. You might suggest an 
alternative sort based on the words in the sort, or students might 
simply be asked to select as many words as possible that are related 
to a semantic category (e.g. shoes, socks and slippers are things you 
wear on your feet). It is not necessary to come up with categories that 
include all the words. The important thing is to teach children how 
to think more flexibly about word features, including sound, pattern 
and meaning, and to allow ample time to discuss their insights. This 
kind of flexible thinking about words will improve spelling, word 
identification, decoding and comprehension (Cartwright, 2008). The Words Their Way 
supplements and the PDToolkit include a number of concept sorts to use to show stu-
dents’ flexibility in sorting.
Games and Other Activities
At the end of each chapter that follows and throughout the PDToolkit, you will find a num-
ber of games and other activities that provide additional practice with words and generalisa-
tions for each stage of spelling. Classrooms are busy places and there is not much time for 
games, but most of these are designed to move quickly in cooperative settings. You can use 
games during the week to reinforce a particular sort and keep them available over time to 
provide review.
Now that we have described the rationale for sorting, provided directions for introducing 
and discussing sorts and demonstrated a variety of ways to sort, we will focus next on how to 
prepare sorts.
Guidelines for Preparing Word Sorts
After identifying spelling stages and grouping students for instruction, as described in 
­Chapter 2, you must decide on what orthographic features to study and prepare collections of 
words or pictures for sorting. The particular feature you choose to study should be based on 
what you see students using but confusing on an inventory or in their writing. No matter what 
the feature is, when preparing word lists for sorting, collect sets of words that offer a contrast 
between at least two sounds, patterns or meaning categories. Compare b to s, compare long o 
patterns such as oa, o-e and ow, or compare words with different prefixes. By carefully setting 
Figure 3.13  Paste and Label the Pictures

C HAP TER 3
up contrasts in a collection of words, you are stacking the deck so that students can make 
discoveries and form generalisations as they sort.
Resources for Sorts and Words
Chapters 4 through 8 have guidelines for features to study at each stage and Appendix D 
has a collection of sample sorts for different stages that can give you ideas about the kinds of 
contrasts to set up. The Words Their Way® companion books provide a complete curriculum 
for each stage, with prepared sorts and assessments for each unit. (See a list of these and other 
resources at the end of this chapter.) However, there are also times when you may want to 
modify existing sorts or create your own. Only you can be sure of what words your students 
can already read and thus use for sorting. It is unlikely that any prepared collection of sorts or 
sequence of study will be just right for your students. Pictures can be found in Appendix C, 
and Appendix E has extensive word lists that you might use to create your own sorts. Addi-
tional resources can be used for determining features to study and finding words:
• Word lists can be found in The Reading Teacher’s Book of Lists (Fry & Kress, 2006), The 
Spelling Teacher’s Book of Lists (Phenix, 1996), and The Spelling List and Word Study Resource 
Book (Fresch & Wheaton, 2004).
• Special dictionaries such as the Scholastic Rhyming Dictionary (Young, 2007) list words by 
rhymes and vowel patterns. Regular dictionaries are good for finding words with such 
beginning features as blends, digraphs and prefixes. Use online dictionaries to search for 
internal spelling patterns such as vowel digraphs or root words. To search for an internal 
pattern, you usually use an asterisk or a question mark before or after the pattern. Using a 
question mark as in “??ar?” or “?ar??” would yield five-letter words with ar in the middle. 
Using an asterisk, as in “*ar*”, would yield all the words in the dictionary with ar in them.
• Some websites have excellent vocabulary enrichment activities such as a “Word of the 
Day” with information about the origins and use of different words. Take some time to 
explore sites such as YourDictionary, Etymonline, WordCentral, Wordnik, Vocabulary 
.com, AllWords and OneLook.
• The spelling features introduced across grade levels in basal phonics and spelling pro-
grammes generally follow the same progression of orthographic features outlined in this 
textbook (e.g., Templeton & Bear, 2011). One difference, however, is that some basal 
phonics or spelling programmes present only one sound or spelling pattern at a time in 
lists that offer no contrasts. For example, one unit may be on words ending with the /ch/ 
phoneme spelled with the tch pattern (patch, itch, fetch, etc.). Without a contrast such as 
the one shown in Figure 3.4, students are not able to discover that the spelling of the final 
sound (tch or ch) is related to the medial vowel sound.
Making Sorts Harder or Easier
Students in different stages and with different levels of skill will be more successful when sorts 
are developed with certain factors in mind. The difficulty of sorts can be adjusted in several ways:
• You may use fewer words with English learners if students do not know the vocabulary. In 
such instances, limit the words you use when introducing a new sort. They may be learn-
ing new vocabulary at the same time they are learning to pronounce the words. Gradually 
introduce a few new words each day so that students can focus on both the sort and the 
new vocabulary. Concept sorting with these same words gives more exposure to the new 
vocabulary.
• The more contrasts that a sort provides, the more challenging it will be. If students are 
young or inexperienced, starting with two categories is a good idea. As they become adept 
at sorting, step up to three categories and then four. Even after working with four catego-
ries or more, however, you may want to go back to fewer categories when you introduce 
a new unit of study.
for Words Their Way®
For each stage, there are 
many sorts that can be 
downloaded and printed or 
played online. You can also 
use the application Create 
Your Own to make sorts.

	
 Organising for Word Study	
91
• The difficulty of the sort also depends on the contrasts you choose. For example, it is 
easier to compare the sounds for / b/ and /s/ than for / b/ and /p/ because the letter names 
b and s are made in different parts of the mouth. Likewise, it is easier for students to learn 
the short sound for i when it is contrasted with the short sound of a or o than with e. Start 
with obvious contrasts before moving to finer distinctions.
• The level of difficulty can be increased or decreased by the actual words you choose as 
examples within each category. For example, adding words with blends and digraphs 
(black, chest, trunk) to a short vowel sort can make those words more challenging than 
simple words like tap and set. Ideally, students should be able to read all of the words in a 
word sort. In reality, however, this may not always be the case. The more unfamiliar words 
in a given sort, the more difficult that sort will be. This caveat applies to both being able 
to read the word and knowing what the word means. A fifth-grader studying derivational 
relations will need easier words to study than a tenth-grader in that same stage, simply 
because the fifth-grader will have a more limited vocabulary. If there are unfamiliar words 
in a sort, try to place them towards the end of the deck so that known words are the first 
to be sorted. Unfamiliar words can be set aside, but revisit them later and encourage your 
students to compare the new spelling with the known words already sorted in the columns 
to arrive at a pronunciation.
• Including a miscellaneous or oddball column with “exception” words that do not fit the 
targeted letter–sound or pattern feature can increase the difficulty of a sort.
Oddballs
Words that are at odds with the consistencies within each category will inevitably turn up in 
word hunts and should be deliberately included in teacher-developed sorts. These words go 
into a miscellaneous category known as Oddballs, rather than exceptions or irregular words. 
The word work, for example, would be an oddball in a sort with other r-influenced o words 
like fork, corn and sport, but it fits a small—but regular—category of words that start with wor: 
world, worm, worse and word. Oddballs are sometimes high-frequency words such as have, said, 
was and again. Such words become memorable from repeated usage, but are also memorable 
because they are odd. They stand out in the crowd. Such words should be included in the sorts 
you prepare, but not too many. One to three oddballs per sort are plenty, so that they do not 
overshadow the regularity you want students to discover.
The oddball category is also where students may place words if they are simply not sure 
about the sound they hear in the word. This often happens when students say words differ-
ently due to dialectical or regional pronunciations that vary from the “standard” pronuncia-
tion. For example, one student in Wise County, Virginia, pronounced the word vein as vine 
and was correct in placing vein in the oddball column as opposed to the long a group. To this 
student, the word vein was a long i. Sometimes students detect subtle variations that adults 
may miss. Students often put words like mail and sail in a different sound category than maid, 
wait and paid, because the long a sound is slightly different before liquid consonants like r 
and l. Mail may sound more like /ma-- l/.
Preparing Your Sorts for Cutting and Storing
Word study does not require a great monetary investment because the basic materials are 
already available in most classrooms. Access to a copier and plenty of unlined paper will get 
you well on your way.
Sorts for Students.  Copies of prepared word sheets or picture sheets as shown in 
Figure 3.14 are available in the Words Their Way supplements for each stage listed on page 112. 
They can also be created by hand using the templates and pictures in this book, the Create Your 
Own feature in the PDToolkit, or by using the tables format on your computer and setting all 
margins at 0 inches. You may want to have the handouts ready first thing Monday morning so 
the sorts can be cut apart and ready for group activities, or you may want to pass the word sheets

out after the group time and assign stu-
dents to cut them apart at their seats.
Show students how to use markers 
or crayons to draw three vertical lines 
down the backside of their paper or 
scribble over it quickly to distinguish 
their word cards from others in case 
they should end up on the floor or get 
mixed up in some way (students use 
different colours). Older students may 
initial their words or mark them in 
some other unique way. Next, model

the sort about 10 percent before copy-
ing to reduce cutting time and paper 
waste. The words or pictures can be 
stored in an envelope or plastic bag 
that is reused each week. Sometimes 
the cut-up words and pictures are kept 
for review, sometimes they are pasted 
into a notebook or onto paper, and sometimes they may be simply discarded. Take the time 
to teach these marking and cutting routines explicitly so that students complete them quickly 
and independently.
With younger students or when cutting is too time-consuming, you may want to have 
prepared sets of pictures and words already cut for sorting. Make sets of pictures by copying 
the pictures in Appendix C onto card stock that is quite durable; laminating and colouring the 
pictures is optional. One or more sets of these pictures can be stored by beginning sounds or 
by vowel sounds, in library pockets or in envelopes. They can then be used for small-group 
work or for individual sorting assignments. For example, you may find that you have one 
student who needs work on digraphs. You can pull out a set of ch and sh pictures, mix them 
together and then challenge the student to sort them into columns using the pocket as a 
header. The sound boards in Appendix B can be copied, cut apart, and used to label the picture 
sets. Resource teachers who have limited time to work with students often create word card 
sets that can be stored in envelopes and reused from year to year.
Some teachers make manila sorting folders for seats or centres as shown in Figure 3.15. File 
folders are divided into columns with key words or pictures for headers glued in place. Words 
or pictures for sorting are stored in the folder in library pockets or plastic bags and students sort 
directly on the folder. You may want to avoid laminating as it makes the sorting surface slippery, 
unless you anticipate heavy use. Once the folders are developed, you can individualise word 
study fairly easily by pulling out the folders that target the exact needs of your students.
Sorts For Teacher Modelling.  For group time you will need your own set of 
words that students can see as you direct a sort. In small groups, you may simply use the same 
cut-out words students have as you model on a table or rug. For larger groups you may want 
to model sorts using an overhead projector (make a transparency of the handout and cut it 
apart), or enlarge the pictures or word cards to use in a pocket chart. Advances in technology 
make it possible to sort easily with document cameras, interactive whiteboards and interactive 
tables. The possibilities are exciting to consider for word sort activities, which lend themselves 
to electronic applications.
Digital Sorting Activities.  Digital sorts for each stage are available online 
at the  Words Their Way PDToolkit, as shown in Figure 3.16, and sorts and word lists in

­Appendices D and E can be used with a variety of software to create eSorts 
(Zucker & Invernizzi, 2008). You can introduce students to sorts using an interac-
tive whiteboard, and then students can repeat the sorts with paper copies, comput-
ers or handheld devices. The Words Their Way Word Study in Action programme 
also includes developmental sorts for the interactive whiteboard (Bear et al., 2012).
Choosing Applications For Word Study.  The digital world 
of phonics, spelling and vocabulary instruction is a fast-growing area, but should be 
selected and used with attention to whether they are developmentally appropriate. 
With the myriad of new applications and software available for students, it is 
important to have in mind guidelines for choosing word study applications. Some 
applications are attractive and fun to play but may not be a proper fit for students. 
These questions can guide you in selecting the appropriate digital word study to 
use with your students:
1.	 Is the application or game instructive for students at this time? Is it develop-
mentally appropriate?
2.	 Can students read the words or name the pictures?
3.	 Can they complete the activity quickly with high accuracy?
4.	 Are students asked to think about words and generalisations?
5.	 Are students given feedback that will help them understand errors they 
might make?
6.	 Does the learning generalise to similar patterns and in different contexts, 
including their writing?
There are engaging applications to reinforce the alphabet, songs, rhyming and letter-sound 
correspondence but often the software does not provide actual instruction for students who need 
it. Many applications have a poor mix of tasks that do not properly guide students, and often 
emphasise rote memorisation without deeper examinations or reflection. You might add direc-
tions to the activities that correct for any deficiencies. For example, remind students to say the 
words aloud, and ask them to write the words into categories in their word study notebooks.
There are many applications that can be used for word study extensions – create a puzzle: 
Stick Around; explain your sort: 3D Avitar, Doceri and EducCreations; make a word map: Popplet;

Preparing Word Study Games for 
Extension and Practice
Games appeal to children, encouraging them to prac-
tise in more depth and apply what they have learned in 
new situations. Games can be left out for several weeks 
after a related sort to provide review. This book con-
tains many ideas for creating games, and you will want 
to begin making these to supplement the basic word or 
picture sorts as you have time. Look for generic games 
in the activity section of each chapter first, as many of 
them can be used with a variety of word features you 
will study across the year. For example, the Follow-the-
Path game being played by the boys in Figure 3.17 can 
be laminated before labelling the spaces so that new 
letters can be substituted as they become the focus of 
study. Label the spaces with a washable overhead pro-
jector pen. Over time you can create more specific games. See Appendix F for templates and 
spinner directions.
Preparing Your Room
Classroom space is needed for group work, individual work and partner work. Separate areas 
for word sorting and discussion are needed to convene a group on the floor or at tables in one 
part of the classroom while other students continue to work at their desks or in other areas 
of the room. Individual sorting and partner work can be done just about anywhere but some 
teachers set up centres or workstations for sorting or playing games. A stopwatch is needed 
for speed sorts and can be placed in a word study centre. Many teachers also post chart-sized 
sound boards in this area. Table 3.3 summarises what you might need, depending on the age 
and range of developmental word knowledge in your classroom.

Implementation of Word Study Instruction
What does a word study classroom look like? How can you differentiate instruction within 
a heterogeneous classroom? How much time does it take? What exactly do students do on 
different days? Ganske and Jocius (2013) concluded that lack of time certainly influenced the 
lack of extended discussions in the classrooms they observed, but how do you find time? These 
questions and more about organising for word study are answered in the sections that follow.
Managing Word Study in the Classroom
Once you have prepared your word sorts and introduced your students to basic sorting proce-
dures, it is time to set up a weekly schedule and develop predictable routines. When schedul-
ing word study in your classroom, consider the following:
• Develop a familiar weekly routine with daily activities. Routines will save you planning time, 
ease transitions and make the most of the instructional time you devote to word study. 
We describe several weekly schedules to give you ideas about how to create your own 
schedules. Include homework routines as well. When parents know what to expect every 
evening, they are more likely to see that the work gets done.
• Schedule time for group work with the teacher. Students at the same developmental level 
should work with you for directed word study. During this time, model new sorts, guide 
practice sorts and lead discussions that help students develop and test hypotheses and 
reach conclusions. Chapter 2 offers assessment-driven guidelines on grouping students 
for instruction.
• Plan time for students to sort independently and with partners. Students need time to sort 
through words on their own and make decisions about their attributes. Build this inde-
pendent work into seatwork and centre activities. Word study also lends itself nicely to 
many cooperative activities. Working together in pairs and in groups allows students to 
learn from each other.
• Keep it short. Word study should be a regular part of daily language arts, but it need not 
take up a great deal of time. Teacher-led introductory lessons take the most time, but 
subsequent activities take little time and do not require a lot of supervision once students 
understand the routines. Try a quick word hunt through already-read pages following a 
guided reading lesson—search for and share words from the reading that fit the features. 
Word study extensions can fit easily into odd bits of time during the day. Students can 
play spelling games right before lunch or sort their words one more time before they pack 
up to go home.
Scheduling Time for Word Study
It is essential that you find time in your day for word study at all grade levels because ortho-
graphic knowledge promotes fluent reading and writing and vocabulary knowledge—critical 
goals for academic success. In this section, we present five types of word study schedules for 
different structures and grade levels.
As you develop a word study schedule, consider the ways students are situated around the 
room, and try to use the entire room. At all grade levels it’s nice to have an area where you 
can meet with a small group, often called a circle area. Word study stations or centres can be 
scattered around the room, and seatwork takes place at students’ seats. Some teachers conduct 
word study lessons as part of their reading groups. Other teachers work with two to three 
separate word study groups and may rotate their students from small-group time with the 
teacher to individual seatwork and workstation or centre times. Still others use a block of time 
that incorporates differentiated word study. Some teachers meet individually with students in 
a largely independent workshop routine. In all settings, focus the word study on active inquiry 
and problem solving, in which students are engaged in their own learning.

classroom routines for 
different stages in five videos.

each video.

You can create and post a schedule for students to follow that you review at the begin-
ning of the day. Table 3.4 illustrates one type of schedule in which reading and word study 
groups are integrated into 25-minute sessions in a circle–seat–centre rotation. This is a com-
mon configuration in grades 1 to 3. In another schedule, in which the teacher focuses only 
on word study, the circle–seat–centre rotation is the same but the time periods are only 15 to 
20 minutes.
Notice also in Table 3.4 that there is a brief period for students to assess their learning 
and activity level before moving to another activity. In the primary grades these evaluation and 
break periods are maybe two to three minutes and may include singing a song or a movement 
activity. But over time, these periods may include some discussion using the questions below. 
Betty Lee, a Washington Post Teacher of the Year, used the following questions with first-grade 
students as they got ready to rotate in the circle–seat–centre configuration, and she posted 
them on the wall for reference:
1.	 Did you finish your work? This first question asks students to think about the nature and 
complexity of the task.
2.	 Did you do the best you could? This question asks students to look at themselves to see if they 
were ready to complete the task, and to consider their level of engagement.
3.	 What did you do when you were through? This third question is designed for students to 
think about what they might do if they complete an assignment early.
Over the first several weeks of school develop a number of activities students can do when they 
are through, including going to the class library or their desks to find a book to read independently.
In the intermediate and secondary grades, students may stay in small groups a whole 
period, and the teacher may travel among the groups to pose similar questions for self-­
reflection. Some of the questions in Table 3.2 might be used for this. In the intermediate 
grades, students may complete contracts or self-assessment forms instead of having a whole-
class meeting. Often in these grades students have plenty of projects to work on once the 
assigned word study or vocabulary activities are completed.
Word Study as an Integrated Part of the Reading Group.  Because 
orthographic knowledge, spelling and reading development are so closely aligned, it makes 
good sense for word study instruction to occur as an extension of the reading group whenever 
  Table 3.4     Circle–Seat–Centre Schedule

	
 Organising for Word Study	
97
possible. Small-group periods can integrate reading, word study and spelling instruction as 
you move quite seamlessly from the reading lesson into word study by asking students to look 
back through certain pages to find words that contain the feature you are about to introduce. 
For example, after a shared reading of The Cat on the Mat (by B. Wildsmith), go back and find 
words in the at family as a way to introduce a sort. After reading a chapter in Frindle (by A. Cle-
ments), ask students to find words that end in ed as an introduction to a unit on inflectional 
endings. This is the time when you may spend 10 minutes on reading and 15 minutes to intro-
duce a new word study sort and have your students repeat the sort under your supervision. 
On subsequent days, you may only spend three to five minutes on word study and the rest on 
reading. The word study would be completed as individual or partner extension activities that 
are completed in centres or at students’ seats, or for homework. This organisational setup is 
efficient and integrates word study into the total reading and language arts programme.
Separate Word Study Groups in a Circle–Seat–CENTRE ­Rotation.  
Table 3.4 shows a plan that works well if your word study groups are separate from the read-
ing groups. Introduce a new sort during circle time to a group of students who are at the same 
developmental level. Half of the remaining students work independently or in buddy pairs for 
seatwork, while the other half work at stations for centre time. After about 15 to 20 minutes, 
the groups rotate. Students at the centres join you at the circle table, students who were working 
at their seats go to the centres and students who had been with you return to their seats to work 
independently or with buddies. Counting transition time, three word study groups rotate through 
all three instructional formats in about an hour. A second, slightly longer rotation occurs also for 
reading groups. This organisation scheme works well in schools in which the entire morning is 
devoted to reading and language arts. Of course, if you have classroom assistants or aides they can 
have their own circle time or supervise students at seats or centres. These push-in teachers may 
include language specialists and Title I teachers, and may make it possible to have four groups.
Word Study Block.  Some teachers set aside a separate word study block on 
­Mondays to meet with each developmental group and then schedule a short follow-up each 
day of the week. All students may cut and sort their words at the same time, but the words they 
sort and the word features they categorise are different. Across the week, during this block of 
time, students will engage in different follow-up activities each day. This organisational plan 
works well for teachers who prefer everyone to be doing the same thing at the same time, yet 
allows for differentiation of instruction within the word study block.
Individualised Word Study in Intervention Settings.  Resource 
teachers who work with small groups of students identified with special needs may have only 
short sessions with mixed-ability groups, making it challenging to implement word sorts. 
However, these are usually the very students who need differentiated word study the most! In 
these settings we recommend that you have appropriate sorts selected and cut out in advance. 
Form groups when possible, but give individual students the pockets of prepared picture or 
word cards or word study folders, described earlier, to use independently as you circulate 
to talk about words, check sorts and lead students to make generalisations. Students might 
complete follow-up activities under your supervision on some days of the week, or they might 
take their sorts back to the regular classroom setting and engage in the same activities as their 
classmates using their own word cards.
Individualised Student Contracts in Upper Elementary, ­Middle 
Schools and High Schools.  Reading and the English language arts are often 
taught in a readers’ workshop environment in the upper grades, in which students may be read-
ing self-selected books as part of literature circles (Daniels, 2002) or book clubs (Raphael, Pardo, 
Highfield & McMahon, 2013). The workshop environment allows you to meet with groups and 
individuals to give direct instruction in word study and provide feedback as necessary.
One- or two-week contracts are particularly useful at the secondary level. Students con-
tract in advance to complete a certain amount of work in different areas and to turn in that

work by a certain date. Figure 3.18 shows a sample student contract that reflects the impor-
tance of activities that examine word meanings. Student contracts “spell out” exactly what is 
expected in terms of assignments and how much they have to do to earn various grades. The 
feature of study may be determined by the goal-setting charts described in Chapter 2.
Weekly Schedules
An important decision involves scheduling word study activities over the course of a week to 
assure adequate practice time. In the following section, we describe several possible schedules 
but encourage you to adapt these to your own setting. In the examples, all of the teachers 
begin with a small-group word study lesson.
Schedules for Students Working with Picture Sorts
Betty Lee, introduced her emergent to letter name–alphabetic spellers to picture sorts at circle 
time while other students worked at centres or at their seats. She organised the word study 
activities into a five-day schedule, as summarised in Table 3.5. This schedule can be modified 
to three days and we recommend an abbreviated schedule when you review initial consonants

at the beginning of first grade, or for moving 
through the large number of blends and digraphs 
at a steady pace.
Figure 3.19 shows an individual pocket folder 
used to keep materials organised and guide stu-
dents to the daily routines. Students can keep their 
cut-out pictures in the envelope until they are 
pasted down or discarded. Each folder has a sound 
board (one of three sound charts that can be found 
in Appendix B) to use as a reference and a record of 
progress. Students simply colour the boxes lightly 
with crayon to indicate which sounds they have 
worked with.
Monday—Picture Sort.  Ideally, the 
choice of initial sounds is based upon what stu-
dents are reading. You may start by finding words 
in the text that begin with particular letters as 
described in the Whole-to-Part Plan in ­Chapter 4. 
In small groups, model a picture sort with a letter 
as a header to help students develop a strong asso-
ciation between the beginning sound of a word and the letter or letters that represent it. Each 
picture is named and compared with the key picture to listen for sounds that are the same. The 
sort might be repeated several times in the circle as a group or with partners. During their 
centre or seat time, students do the same picture sort again on their own or with a partner.
Tuesday—Draw and Label.  Students sort again and then extend the feature 
through drawing and labelling activities that ask them to think of other words that have the 
same beginning sound, as in Figure 3.12 on page 88. Encourage students to write as much of 
the word as they can, using developmental spelling to label their drawing. Assess these spell-
ings to judge student progress in hearing and representing sounds.
Wednesday—Cut and Paste.  After re-sorting, students can paste the picture sort 
into categories and label them. Or, they can look through old catalogues and magazines for

­pictures that begin with a particular sound. These pictures are cut out, pasted into categories 
or into an alphabet book (as described in Activity 4.25 in Chapter 4), and labelled.
Thursday—Word and Picture Hunts.  Under your direction, students 
reread nursery rhymes and jingles, and look for words that begin with the same sounds they 
have been categorising all week. You can then add the words to a chart. Students can also go 
for word hunts in alphabet books or picture dictionaries as a circle or centre activity. Keep a 
variety on hand to teach students rudimentary research skills. Their findings can be recorded 
as an additional draw and label activity.
Friday—Game Day and Assessment.  Introduce new games and activities 
related to the sort and then keep them available for several weeks in centres. Children 
delight in the opportunity to play board or card games and other fun activities for further 
practice. Assessment at this level is primarily informal as the teacher watches for automatic-
ity and accuracy during sorting and how well students label pictures or use initial sounds 
in writing.
Schedule for Students Working with Word Sorts
The next schedule works well for children who are readers and able to spell entire words. This 
can be students in the middle to late letter name–alphabetic stage all the way up to derivational 
relations, so this is the basic schedule for most teachers. Sorting words in a variety of contexts 
and completing assignments in a word study (WS) notebook comprise most of the schedule 
summarised in Table 3.6. The exact routines you do each day throughout the week may vary 
depending on time and preferences but we do recommend re-sorting for several days and 
including the blind sort on Wednesday or Thursday for students working with vowel patterns.
Word Study Notebooks.  Composition books with stiff cardboard covers and 
sewn pages make good WS notebooks that last all year. They provide a built-in, orderly 
record of activities and progress. Many teachers grade the WS notebooks as part of an 
overall spelling grade. Figure 3.20 is an example of the kinds of expectations and grading 
criteria used by Kathy Gankse when she taught fourth grade. This chart can be reproduced 
and pasted inside the cover of the notebook. Possible assignments such as the following can 
be completed in the WS notebook. You may want to distinguish required activities, such as 
recording the sort, and choice activities, such as draw and label. There is no need to do each 
activity every week and some are more valuable at times than others. Other ideas for WS 
notebooks are noted in the chapters that follow.

• Writing sorts. Students record the words into the same catego-
ries developed during hands-on sorting using the same key 
words or headers. You can also ask students to write a reflection 
that summarises the generalisation or the big idea about this 
word sort.
• Select five to ten words to draw and label. Even older students enjoy 
the opportunity to illustrate words with simple drawings that 
reveal their meanings. Ask students to illustrate ­homophones 
like bear and bare and the multiple meanings of homonyms like 
park or yard.
• Word operations. Students change a letter (or letters) of a selected 
word to make new words. Initial letters, or orthographic units, 
might be substituted to create lists of words that rhyme. For 
example, starting with the word black, a student might sub-
stitute other consonant blends or digraphs to generate stack, 
quack, track, shack and so on. Students studying more complex 
words might substitute prefixes, suffixes or roots—for example, 
using graph to generate autograph, biography, photograph and 
photography.
• Select five words to use in sentences. Meaning and usage are impor-
tant as students begin to study homophones, inflected words 
(ride, rides, riding) and roots and suffixes. Challenge students to 
use two or more words from their sort, especially derivationally 
related words. (I will need new spectacles to inspect the spectacular 
new specimens.)
• Record words from word hunts in trade books and response journals. Students add new words 
from their reading and writing to the written sorts in their WS notebooks.
• Record times from speed sorts. When students are timed early in the week and then again 
after repeated sorting, they are likely to show improvement.
• Record a blind writing sort. Led by a partner or the teacher, a blind writing sort is a good 
preparation for a final spelling assessment.
Monday—Introduce the Sort.  Words are introduced and sorted according to 
one of the levels of support described in Table 3.1 on page 80. Many teachers like to keep each 
group’s attention on one set of word cards used for modelling and guided practice. Then, stu-
dents sort their own words individually in the group, at their seats, and for homework. Repeat 
this procedure with the next group, focusing on a different feature. Each group has different 
words, depending on the students’ stage of development. After meeting with a second and 
third group, circulate around the room to check in with students sorting at their desks.
If you do not want to take a large block of time on Monday to do all the introductory 
small-group sorts, spread them across the week by meeting with one group a day on ­Monday, 
Tuesday and Wednesday, with each group’s independent work operating on an “offset” 
­schedule (see Table 3.7). In such a schedule, students with the least ability get the most prac-
tice, but everyone does similar activities by Thursday and Friday. An alternative is to give all 
groups a five-day schedule but begin and end on different days of the week.
Tuesday—Practise the Sort, Initial Speed Sort and Writing 
Sort.  Students sort again, usually at their seats. Encourage students to “say it and lay it”. 
That means that they read the words as they sort. Circulate through the classroom and ask 
students to read the words and explain their thinking in preparation for writing a reflection. 
If more support is needed, students can bring their words to sort under your supervision in a 
brief session or as part of a guided reading group. Assign students a writing sort for seatwork 
or for homework. Speed sorts might also be planned for Tuesday. Students are sure to show 
improvement when they do a speed sort later in the week.

Wednesday—Blind Sorts and Writing Sorts.  Students work in pairs to 
do blind sorts. After each partner has had a turn to lead the sort, the pair might do a blind writ-
ing sort in which partners take turns calling words aloud for the other to write into categories. 
This can also be a homework assignment.
Thursday—Second Speed Sort and Word Hunts.  Thursday is a good 
day to sort for speed as students try to beat their times from earlier in the week. Conduct 
word hunts in groups, with partners or individually. All students in the class can be engaged 
at the same time by convening in their respective groups. Circulate from group to group to 
comment and listen in on students’ discussions. Ask group members to provide reasons for 
the agreed word groupings. Afterwards, students record words from the hunt in their WS 
notebooks. For homework that night, students can find additional examples to add to their 
notebooks from the books they are reading at home.
Friday—Games and Assessment.  Although games can be played any time, 
­Fridays might be when new games are introduced. Games from previous weeks provide ongo-
ing review and you need not provide a game for every sort. Students pair up with partners or 
join small groups according to their developmental levels during centre time or a designated 
word study time.
You can use a traditional spelling test format for assessment. If you have two or three 
groups, simply call one word in turn for each group. This may sound confusing, but students 
will recognise the words they have studied over the week and rarely lose track. It is not nec-
essary to call out every word studied during the week; 10 words is probably enough. Many 
teachers call out some bonus or transfer words that were not among the original list to see 
whether students can generalise the orthographic principles to new words. In this way, the 
generalisation is emphasised, as opposed to rote memorisation of a given list of words. You 
might prompt students in the case where two or more patterns are possible by saying some-
thing like, “If you know how to spell train then you can spell brain.” It is particularly effective 
to conduct the spelling test as a writing sort, having students write each word as it is called 
out into the category where it belongs. Award one point for correct category placement and 
one point for correct spelling.
Some teachers are expected to assign grades for spelling, or spelling may be averaged into 
a language arts or writing grade. Ideally, such a grade should include more than an average 
of Friday test scores. Figure 3.21 offers a more holistic assessment using a form that can be 
adapted for different grade levels. You may wish to add a section for students to rate them-
selves. The form in the illustration might be used with students in upper elementary grades 
who can be expected to spell most words correctly.

Friday completes the cycle for the week. If students have been appropriately placed and 
engaged in a variety of activities throughout the week, they should score well on the Friday 
test (90 percent or better). Results of the Friday test and observations made during the week 
influence your plans for the next week. If scores are low, you need to consider why this is so. 
Was the feature too difficult? Were the words selected too difficult? Did the students get 
enough practice? Should you revisit the feature? Group membership may also change depend-
ing on a given student’s success.
Scheduling for Students in the Middle and Secondary Grades
Because middle and secondary English classes are not usually as heterogeneous as elemen-
tary classrooms, students are more likely to have similar word study needs. Still, the typical 
middle or secondary English teacher plans instruction for students in at least two different 
stages of word knowledge. If you work with students reading below grade level in middle

school or high school, we recommend Words Their Way® with Struggling Readers: Word Study 
for Reading, Vocabulary and Spelling Instruction, Grades 4–12 (Flanigan, Hayes, Templeton, Bear, 
Invernizzi & Johnston, 2011) as a resource to help you organise and carry out word study.
Students in middle and high school sometimes change classes every 50 minutes, or if the 
school uses block scheduling, every 1 hour and 40 minutes. Either way, the constraints of periods 
or blocks limit the way word study is conducted. Some teachers find that a two-week cycle works 
well. Students have more time to work with a set of words and word hunts can go on for days 
instead of taking time on a particular day. One way to organise word study instruction in second-
ary classrooms is by using contracts or individualised assignment plans, as described previously. 
However, you must still find time to meet with students to introduce new sorts, provide corrective 
feedback and discuss generalisations either individually or in groups (Templeton et al., 2015).
If students are in the late syllables and affixes stage or the derivational relations stage, it is 
less important for them to physically sort word cards, although students at this level still enjoy 
the hands-on sorting. Instead, sorts can be conducted in writing, using a worksheet format in 
which students write the words listed at the top or bottom of the sheet into the appropriate 
category. Other word study activities may also be conducted as paper-and-pencil tasks and 
organised in a word study section of a three-ring binder.
In middle and high school, work with content teachers to coordinate vocabulary instruc-
tion so that domain-specific vocabulary can be intertwined in the English vocabulary ­instruction 
(Bear et al., 2014). Generative vocabulary processes should also continue to be addressed, 
incorporating the Greek and Latin roots and affixes that occur across all disciplines as well as 
those that occur primarily in specific content areas (Templeton et al., 2015). At least quarterly, 
teachers might meet to share the key vocabulary and concepts, as well as roots and affixes, that 
will be taught. By sharing responsibility for teaching vocabulary, the number of exposures to 
words that students encounter enhances their vocabulary. This deepens their knowledge of 
words and their understanding of nuances in vocabulary.
Word Study Homework and Parental Expectations
Classrooms are busy places and many teachers find it difficult to devote a lot of time to word study 
but homework can provide valuable additional practice. A letter such as the one shown in Figure 
3.22 is a good way to encourage parents to become involved in their children’s spelling home-
work. A checklist such as the one in Figure 3.23 can be sent home with an extra copy of the words 
for the week stored in an envelope or plastic zip bag. You might allow students to choose two or 
three activities, and more options can be added to the checklist occasionally, such as using a small 
number of words in sentences. Parents are typically firm believers in the importance of spelling 
because it is such a visible sign of literacy. Unfortunately, developmental or invented spelling is 
often misunderstood and parents unfairly associate the acceptance of developmental spelling with 
lack of instruction and an “anything goes” expectation regarding spelling. Communicate clearly 
to parents that their children will be held accountable for what they have been taught. Homework 
assignments help them see what is being taught in phonics and spelling.
Getting Started with Word Study
For students who are not familiar with the process of sorting and for teachers who are hesitant 
about implementing a brand new organisational scheme, we offer some recommendations 
about how to gradually transition into fully differentiated word study.
1.	 Begin with the whole group and teach the routines. Start with one to three weeks of whole-
class sorts that will be relatively easy for everyone in the class. Use a teacher-directed 
closed sort for maximum support so you can model and offer explicit directions. Teach 
students the basic routines that you want them to use throughout the week. Role-play 
buddy activities such as blind sorts or writing sorts by having students observe as you 
partner with a student, demonstrating how to lead the sort and take turns. Show students 
how to cut words out quickly and neatly.

2.	 Teach students how to talk about the sorts. You need to show students how to think about 
words, how to reflect and how to form generalisations that summarise their new learn-
ing. If students have trouble responding to your open-ended questions, model your own 
thinking with phrases like “I notice that…” or “I learned that….” Ask students to begin 
their reflections the same way and give them the language to formulate statements until 
they can do it for themselves. (“This week we learned about how two-syllable words 
sometimes have double letters in the middle and short vowel sounds in the first syllable.”) 
Ask students to turn and talk to a partner before sharing in the group to increase verbal 
interactions.
3.	 Begin to differentiate. Once routines are 
well established, begin to work with two 
and then three groups of students. Because 
students in the lowest group need the most 
help, create that group first as the other 
students continue to work together. Then 
split that group. Observe how students sort, 
how they do on spell checks and how they 
work together to modify groups as needed.
4.	 Introduce student-centred sorts. With experi-
ence students gain skill and independence, 
which makes it easier for you to manage 
the groups in a more timely ­fashion or to 
move to the offset schedule in Table 3.7 
on page 102. Model how to do open sorts 
by thinking aloud as you sort before you 
assign them to students.
Dear Parents,
Your child will be bringing home a collection of spelling words weekly that have been intro-
duced in class. Each night of the week your child is expected to do a different activity to ensure 
that these words and the spelling principles they represent are mastered. These activities have 
been modelled and practised in school, so your child can teach you how to do them.
Monday   Remind your child to sort the words into categories like the ones we did in school. 
Your child should read each word aloud during this activity. Ask your child to explain to you 
why the words are sorted in a particular way—what does the sort reveal about spelling in gen-
eral? Ask your child to sort them a second time as fast as possible. You may want to time them.
Tuesday   Do a blind sort with your child. Lay down a word from each category as a header 
and then read the rest of the words aloud. Your child must indicate where the word goes with-
out seeing it. Lay it down and let your child move it if he or she is wrong. Repeat if your child 
makes more than one error.
Wednesday   Assist your child in doing a word hunt, looking in a book they have already read 
for words that have the same sound, pattern or both. Try to find two or three for each category.
Thursday   Do a writing sort to prepare for the Friday test. As you call out the words in a ran-
dom order your child should write them in categories. Call out any words your child misspells a 
second or even third time.
Thank you for your support. Together we can help your child make valuable progress!
Sincerely,

Shari Dunn and Tamara Baren suggest introducing the sorting process to young students 
by using objects or pictures, beginning with just two categories in a closed concept sort (such 
as animals/not animals, or animals/birds). Objects with obvious attributes will be easier for 
young students to sort than abstract sounds. Also, teach routines that students will be using 
such as draw and label or cut and paste. When they are familiar with the sorting process, 
introduce sound sorts such as two rhyming categories or two initial sounds.
Integrating Word Study into Reading, Writing  
and the Language Arts Curriculum
The weekly schedules described in this chapter provide examples of how to integrate spelling 
instruction into the language arts classroom, implementing routines that are central to both 
reading and writing. Students return again and again to trade books they have already read to 
analyse the reading vocabulary. Poetry lessons might begin with reference to a word study les-
son on syllable stress. In a writing lesson, students might discuss comparative adjectives from 
a previous word study lesson that focused on words ending in er. During a lesson on parts 
of speech, students can be asked to sort their week’s spelling words into categories of nouns, 
verbs and adjectives. Whatever scheduling scheme you choose, your sequence of activities 
must fit comfortably within your reading/writing/language arts block of instruction.
The features and strategies that students learn during word study should also be applied 
to decoding strategies during reading and to spelling strategies during writing. If students get 
stuck on a word while reading, prompt them with a word study cue. For example, remind them 
to look for the vowel pattern or to break a word into syllables. Point out the similarity between 
the orthographic features in a particular word and the spelling features they have been sorting. 
The more frequently you make such connections between word study and decoding strategies, 
the more often your students will use them. This is equally true for writing—many teachers 
use the features students are categorising during word study for targeted proofreading.
Teachers and parents often complain that students get perfect scores on their spelling 
tests only to misspell those same words in their writing assignments the following week. To 
ensure transfer of the big ideas gained during word study, students must be engaged in activi-
ties that specifically require them to apply their growing word knowledge through wide read-
ing and writing. Using techniques such as the following promotes the connection between 
reading, writing and word study.
Generalise to New Words.  Words that students cannot read when a sort is first 
introduced can be used after sorting to apply a generalisation, so set those aside to return to 
later. After working with a feature (such as the r-influenced vowels that Mrs. Zimmerman had 
her students sort), display additional words that have the same phonics or spelling feature so 
that students can apply what they have learned to reading additional words (e.g., flare, blare, 
snare, flair, lair). This might be presented in sentences such as, “The cougar retreated to its 
lair.” Do the same thing with spelling unfamiliar words. Ask students to attempt start, sharp 
or smart. In the case of the /air/ sound there are two possible spellings, so begin with a clue 
such as, “You know how to spell care, so how would you spell dare?”
Dictated or Silly Sentences.  Select several words from the weekly word sort and 
dictate a sentence for the student to write. For example, following an at and an rhyming family 
word sort, letter name spellers might be asked to write, “The fat cat sat in the tan van” (Johnston, 
Invernizzi, Juel & Lewis-Wagner, 2009). Derivational spellers might be asked to write, “The 
competitor competed in the competition”, following a sort involving derivational pairs in which 
they examined how vowel sounds are altered when adding suffixes as in the change in vowel 
sounds from the long e in compete to the altered sounds of the e in competitor and competition.
Relations Among Related Relatives.  Provide a word root such as divide 
and ask students to write related words like division, divisive, divisor or dividend. Interesting

discussions about students’ thinking as they spelled these related words are likely to follow, 
including lots of talk about the meaning as well as about sound and spelling patterns.
Cover and Connect.  Write a word on the board and demonstrate how to cover up 
word parts, saying the remaining portion and then connecting that segment with the rest of 
the word when it is uncovered (O’Connor, 2007). The parts that are covered vary according 
to developmental stage of word knowledge. For letter name–alphabetic spellers, consonant 
digraphs, consonant blends or the short-vowel rhyming family can be covered and then 
­connected (e.g., fl-at). For within word pattern spellers, long-vowel patterns can be covered 
and connected to the remaining consonant blends or digraphs (e.g., sn-ake). For syllables and 
affixes spellers, prefixes and suffixes can be covered and connected to base words, or syllables 
can be covered and connected one to the next (e.g., re-read-ing; in-ter-est-ing). When students 
encounter a word they don’t know in their reading, they can be prompted to use this cover 
and connect strategy for decoding.
Word Walls.  Word walls have become a staple in many primary classrooms. They are 
a useful resource for learning a relatively small set of words and can supplement systematic 
developmental word study. Word walls as originally conceived by Pat Cunningham (2000, 
2013) are a display of alphabetically-ordered, high-utility words that grows cumulatively 
across the school year. We provide a list of high-frequency words on page 390 but select 
words based on your students’ needs. Cunningham recommends that five words needed for 
reading and writing be added each week, and students should engage in activities that help 
secure those words in memory—chanting the letters, writing the words several times, and 
playing games (like Bingo) with the words. If you want to hold students responsible for using 
the word wall, then you need to add words gradually, plan quick daily activities, model using 
it and review the wall regularly. We recommend that word walls for beginning readers provide 
separate column headers for consonant digraphs, like CH for chick, SH for shoe.
Word walls should not look the same at all grade levels. In kindergarten, they should 
begin with student’s names and then several high-frequency words might be added each week 
such as the, can and like —words that students often use in their writing and see in their read-
ing. By second grade, students should have mastered many of the most common words but 
other words like because, or homophones like their, there and they’re, are good candidates for 
a word wall. You can easily find out which words students 
have already mastered by asking them to spell them. The 
list in Appendix E has high-frequency words ordered by 
the first hundred, second hundred and third hundred.
Word Displays.  Besides word walls there are 
other kinds of word displays that serve various purposes. 
Charts of word families, syllable types, Latin roots, con-
tent vocabulary, word hunt results and other word displays 
posted around the room announce to students, parents and 
visitors that words are valued and celebrated. Word dis-
plays call attention to the richness and power of a versatile 
vocabulary and provide a ready reference for writing. See 
Figure 3.24 for more ideas.
Resources such as The Reading Teacher’s Book of Lists 
(Fry & Kress, 2006) will give you more ideas about inter-
esting categories of words, but it is important that students 
are involved as much as possible in the creation of such 
lists for them to be useful and meaningful. For example, in 
the activity Said is Dead, students help brainstorm lists of 
words (e.g., shouted, jeered, whispered, lisped ) to use in their 
writing instead of that overworked verb (said ). In addition, 
be mindful of referring to such displays on a regular basis 
• Spelling demons (relevant, unparalleled)
• Onomatopoeia words (boo-hoo, cockadoodledoo)
• Sophisticated synonyms (tell = explain, enumerate, 
­explicate, justify, illustrate)
• Oxymorons (plastic silverware)
• Multiple meanings (bat, run, draw)
• Brand names that now represent a generic product 
(Kleenex for tissue)
• Homophones and homographs (due/dew, wind/wind)
• Collective nouns (batch of brownies, gaggle of geese)
• Acronyms (LASER, SCUBA)
• Eponyms (Louis Pasteur—pasteurisation)
• Spanish–English cognates (content–contento)
• Palindromes (mom)
• Idioms (pulling your leg)
• Puns (an artist who could really draw a crowd)
• Similes (smiling like an angel)
• Alliteration (big bad Bruce)

if you want students to benefit from them. Continue to add to such lists to keep them fresh in 
students’ minds and when you add a new word, go back over the list of previous words.
Selecting Written Word Study Activities:  
A Caveat Regarding Tradition
There are many long-standing activities associated with spelling that teachers often assign 
their students, such as writing words five times, listing them in alphabetical order, and copying 
definitions from the dictionary. Assignments like these do not fulfil the purpose of spelling 
instruction, which is not only to learn the spellings of particular words but also to understand 
generalisations about the spelling system itself and to cultivate a curiosity about words. Writ-
ing a word five times is a rote, meaningless and ineffective activity (Templeton & Morris, 
2000), whereas writing words into categories requires recognising common spelling features 
and using judgement and critical thinking. Writing words in alphabetical order may teach 
alphabetisation, but it will not teach anything about spelling patterns. (Alphabetising words 
might be assigned occasionally as a separate dictionary skill, but students will be more success-
ful at it when they can first sort their word cards into alphabetical order before writing them.)
Students do need to associate meanings with the words they are studying so it is reason-
able to ask them to discuss or look up the meanings of a few words they do not know or to find 
additional meanings for words, but asking students to write out the definitions of long lists of 
words whose meanings they already know is boring and not likely to encourage dictionary use 
or a curiosity about words.
Writing words in sentences can also be overdone. You might ask students to choose 
5 words (out of 20 to 25) each week to write sentences in their word study notebooks. For 
example, students like the challenge of using two or more in the same sentence. This is a more 
reasonable assignment than writing 20 isolated sentences with the weekly spelling list. Many 
teachers employ sentence writing to work on handwriting, punctuation and grammar (see 
the expectations in Figure 3.20 on page 101). Writing sentences is also more useful for some 
features than others. For example, sentences will help students show that they understand 
homophones or the tenses of verb forms when studying inflectional endings such as ed and ing.
Be wary of other traditional assignments that take up time and may even be fun, but have 
little value in teaching children about spelling. Activities such as Hangman, word searches and 
acrostics may keep students busy, but they impart little or no information about the English 
spelling system. While it is exciting to see the interest generated for the yearly spelling bee 
broadcast on national television, it is still the case that spelling bees reward children who are 
already good spellers and quickly eliminate the children who need practice the most.
Word study can be fun, but make good use of the time available and do not overdo it. 
Remember that word study activities should be short in duration so that students can devote 
most of their attention and time to reading and writing for meaningful purposes.
Spelling Expectations
Invented spelling, or spelling “as best you can”, frees students to write even before they can read 
during the emergent stage, and they should be free to make spelling approximations when writ-
ing rough drafts at all levels. The Common Core State Standards encourage this and refer to this 
process as “phonetic spelling”. Invented spelling, or as we like to call it, developmental spelling, 
also offers you diagnostic information about what students know and what they need to learn. 
But that does not mean that you do not hold students accountable for accurate spelling. Knowing 
where students are in terms of development level and considering which word features they have 
studied enables you to set reasonable expectations for accuracy and editing. For example, you can 
expect third-grade students in the within word pattern stage to spell words like jet, flip and must, 
but it is unreasonable to expect them to handle multisyllabic words like leprechaun or celebration. 
Just as students are gradually held more and more accountable for conventions of writing such as 
commas and semicolons, so, too, are they gradually held more accountable for spelling accuracy.

	
 Organising for Word Study

A study by Clarke (1988) found that first-graders who were encouraged to use invented 
developmental spellings wrote more and could spell as well at the end of the year as first-graders 
who had been told how to spell the words before writing. The National Reading Panel report 
(2000), and more recently, a comprehensive review of research on spelling instruction (Graham & 
­Santangelo, 2014), also underscored the importance of encouraging students to apply their knowl-
edge of letter–sound relationships in their writing. This suggests that students are not marred by 
their own invented developmental spellings, nor do they persevere with errors over time. However, 
unless you communicate that correct spelling is valued, students may develop careless habits.
Many teachers wonder when they should make the shift from allowing students to write 
in invented developmental spelling to demanding correctness. The answer is “from the start”. 
You must hold students accountable for what they have been taught; what they have not been 
taught can be politely ignored. For example, if a student has been taught consonant sound-
to-letter correspondences, you would expect the student to spell those sounds correctly, as in 
PGS LK MD (Pigs like mud). However, if the student has not yet been taught the short vowel 
sounds needed in pigs and mud, these attempts should be allowed to stand as is. Because the 
sequence for phonics and spelling instruction is cumulative and progresses linearly from easier 
features such as individual letter sounds to harder features such as Latin-derived tion, sion and 
cian endings, there will always be some features that have not yet been taught. Thus, students 
(and adults) will always invent a spelling for what they do not yet know.
Proofreading for spelling.  While students might be encouraged to spell as 
best they can when they compose rough drafts, daily journal entries or observation notes for 
a science experiment, there are times when writing products should be spelled as accurately as 
possible, especially in the upper grades. Proofreading involves identifying misspelled words, so 
it is not an easy task for younger students who are still spelling many words incorrectly. Proof-
reading needs to be handled judiciously in the lower grades and can be adjusted for students’ 
development. After identification, the errors need to be corrected using a variety of spelling 
strategies (Turbil, 2000). Students need to be explicitly taught how to execute this complex 
skill, not simply told to proofread. You can use your own or a student’s writing samples (with 
permission) that contain errors to model the ideas in Figure 3.25. Subsequent chapters have 
additional information about what spelling strategies and resources are appropriate for each 
stage, including the development of dictionary skills.
• Focus only on spelling. Don’t expect students to edit for punctuation, spelling and word choice all at the same time. Have 
students reread with just spelling in mind as one step of the editing process.
• Reread carefully for errors. It is often hard to proofread one’s own work because it is so familiar that we may not pay careful 
­attention to the printed words. The key is to focus attention on spelling and this can be done by reading aloud, pointing to 
each word with a pencil, reading each line backward or getting someone else to read it for you, such as an assigned editing 
buddy. Waiting a few days to reread also seems to help.
• Give students tools such as coloured pencils in blue or green (rather than red) to use for correcting circling, or underlining 
­misspelled words. This way you can monitor their corrections and even talk with them about the strategies they used.
• Keep the task manageable. You might assign students to find and correct a certain number of errors so that they do not feel 
overwhelmed. Five might be reasonable for students who are still misspelling a large percentage. Or you might ask students 
to look for errors related to the feature they are currently studying, such as long vowels or inflected endings.
• Teach students to use resources such as a word wall or dictionaries to correct misspellings. A simple spelling dictionary is a list 
of words arranged alphabetically and may be only a few pages long. This is much easier to use as it does not have definitions 
or other information typically found in a dictionary.
• Teach students to use spellcheck as part of a word processing application.
• Sometimes we want a final draft to be absolutely perfect, especially if it will be published in a classroom collection, school 
newspaper or other permanent place. This is the point at which teachers, parents or other reliable sources should serve as 
the final copyeditor.

Principles of Word Study Instruction
A number of basic principles guide the kind of word study described in Words Their Way® 
(you were introduced to some of these at the beginning of the chapter as they related 
to Mrs.  ­Zimmerman’s class). Many of these principles set word study apart from other 
approaches to the teaching of phonics, spelling or vocabulary.
Look for what Students use but Confuse.  Students cannot learn things 
they do not already know something about. This is the underlying principle of Vygotsky’s 
(1962) zone of proximal development (ZPD) and the motivating force behind the assessment 
described in Chapter 2. By analysing invented developmental spellings, a ZPD may be identi-
fied and instruction can be planned to address features the students are using but confusing 
instead of those they totally neglect (Invernizzi et al., 1994). Take your cue from the students 
to teach developmentally.
A Step Backward is a Step Forward.  Once you have identified students’ 
stages of developmental word knowledge and the orthographic features under negotiation, 
take a step backward and build a firm foundation. Then, in setting up your categories, contrast 
something new with something that is already known. It is important to begin word study 
activities where students will experience success. For example, students in the within word 
pattern stage who are ready to examine long vowel patterns begin by sorting words by short 
vowel sounds, which are familiar, and long-vowel sounds, which are being introduced for the 
first time. Then they move quickly to sorting by pattern. A step backward is the first step 
forward in word study instruction.
Use Words Students Can Read.  It is much easier to analyse words students 
can already pronounce. Known words come from any and all sources that students can read: 
language experience stories, recent readings, poems and phonics readers. As much as possible, 
choose words to sort that students can read out of context. Put any aside they cannot read to 
examine later.
Compare Words That “DO” With Words That “Don’t”.  To 
learn what a Chesapeake Bay retriever looks like, you have to see a poodle or a bulldog, 
not another Chesapeake Bay retriever. What something is is also defined by what it is 
not; contrasts are essential to students’ building of categories. Students’ spelling errors 
suggest what contrasts will help them sort out their confusions. For example, a student 
who is spelling stopping as STOPING will benefit from a sort in which words with 
consonants that are doubled before adding ing are contrasted with those that do not 
take doubled letters, as in Figure 3.26.
Begin with Obvious Contrasts.  When students start studying a new 
feature, choose key words or pictures that are distinctive. For example, when students 
first examine initial consonants, do not begin by contrasting m with n, which are both 
nasals and visually similar. It is better to begin by contrasting m with something totally 
different at first—s, for example—before working towards finer distinctions as these 
categorisations become quite automatic. Move from general, gross differences to more 
specific discriminations.
Sort by Sound and Pattern.  Students examine words by how they 
sound and how they are spelled. Both sound and visual pattern are part of students’ 
orthographic knowledge. Too often, students focus on visual patterns at the expense 
of how words are alike in sound. The following sort illustrates the way students move 
from a sound sort (by hard and soft g) to a visual pattern sort (by final dge, ge and g). 
See what you can discover from this sort. (Hint: pay attention to the vowel sounds.)

Don’t Hide Exceptions.  Exceptions arise when students make generalisations. Do 
not hide these exceptions. By placing so-called irregular words in a miscellaneous or oddball 
category, new categories of consistency sometimes emerge. For example, in looking at long 
vowel patterns, students find exceptions like give, have and love, yet it is no coincidence that 
they all have a ve. They form a small but consistent pattern of their own. True exceptions do 
occur (e.g., was, women, laugh) and become memorable by virtue of their rarity.
Avoid Rules.  Rules with many exceptions are disheartening and teach students 
nothing. They may have heard the long vowel rule, “When two vowels go walking, the 
first one does the talking”, but this rule does not apply in phonetically regular words 
like boot or soil. Learning about English spelling requires students to consider sound and 
pattern simultaneously to discover consistencies in the orthography. This requires both 
reflection and continued practice. Students discover consistencies and make generalisa-
tions for themselves. Your job is to stack the deck and structure categorisation tasks to 
make these consistencies explicit and to instil in students the habit of looking at words, 
asking questions and searching for order. Rules are useful mnemonics if you already 
understand the underlying concepts at work. They are the icing on the cake of knowledge. 
But memorising rules is not the way students make sense of how words work. Rules are 
no substitute for experience.
Work for Automaticity.  Accuracy in sorting is not enough—accuracy and ease 
are the ultimate indicators of mastery. Acquiring automaticity in sorting and recognising 
orthographic patterns leads to the fluency necessary for proficient reading and writing. 
Your students will move from hesitancy to fluency in their sorting. Keep sorting until 
they do.
Return to Meaningful Texts.  After sorting, students need to return to mean-
ingful texts to hunt for other examples to add to the sorts. These hunts extend their analysis to 
more words and more difficult vocabulary. For example, after sorting one-syllable words into 
categories labelled cat, drain and snake, a student added tadpole, complain and relate. Through a 
simple word hunt, this child extended the pattern-to-sound consistency in one-syllable words 
to stressed syllables in two-syllable words.
These principles of word study boil down to one golden rule of word study instruction: 
Teaching Is Not Telling ( James, 1958). In word study, students examine, manipulate and catego-
rise words. In order for this to happen, you must create a systematic programme of word study, 
guided by an informed interpretation of spelling errors and other literacy behaviours. This is 
a teacher-directed, student-centred approach to vocabulary growth and spelling development. 
The next five chapters will show you exactly how to provide effective word study instruction 
for students at different stages of development.

his chapter describes the literacy development that occurs during the emergent 
stage, a period in which young children imitate and experiment with the forms and 
functions of print: directionality, the distinctive features of print, the predictability 
of text and how all of these correlate with oral language. The emergent stage lies at the begin-
ning of a lifetime of learning about written language. Emergent children do not read or spell 
conventionally and they score 0 on spelling inventories like those in Chapter 2 because they 
have only very tenuous understandings of how units of speech and units of print are related. 
Nevertheless, children are developing remarkable insights into written language, and with the 
help of caregivers and teachers they learn a great deal. Before we go into a thorough descrip-
tion of the emergent stage, we will visit a kindergarten classroom in mid-year.
During a unit about pets, Mrs. Smith shares a big book, Cat on the Mat, by Brian Wildsmith. This simple patterned 
book opens with a cat sitting contentedly on a mat, but on each subsequent page bigger and bigger animals join 
as the cat becomes increasingly agitated. When an elephant joins, the cat hisses and all the animals run away. 
Mrs. Smith introduces the book by pointing to the cover and asking, “Where is the cat?” Several children sing out, 
“on the rug”.  Then she says, “Let’s look at the title here”. As she reads she point to each word. “It says, Cat on the…” 
and she pauses while several children say, “on the rug”.  “Hmmm”, says Mrs. Smith. “The picture does look like a rug 
but this word (pointing to Mat) starts with M and r-r-r-rug would start with R. What else could this be? I will give you 
a clue: it rhymes with cat. Listen, Cat on the Mmmmmat. We use mats at rest time, don’t we?”
After asking the children what they think the book will be about she says, “Let’s read and find out what 
­happens”. She points to the words in the single sentence for each two-page spread and by the third sentence the 
children are catching on to the pattern and saying the name of the new animal. She pauses before the elephant 
appears and asks for predictions about what the next animal might be and why they think it might be that animal. 
On a second reading the children can all join in and read along chorally. Mrs. Smith takes the time to ask about how 
the cat is feeling about sharing the mat with so many animals. The children suggest mad but she introduces several 
new vocabulary words (upset, angry and furious) and uses them to describe the cat’s growing discontentment lead-
ing up to the hiss.
In this fashion, Mrs. Smith shares a predictable book with her children that they can easily memorise and read 
along with her. In the process she draws her students’ attention to letters and sounds and models pointing to words 
as she reads. She also finds an opportunity to introduce some new vocabulary. After enjoying the big book version, 
she plans a number of follow-up activities to further develop emergent literacy skills.
On the next day the story is reread and the cat’s feelings are described again with the target vocabulary words. 
Mrs. Smith defines the words (upset is when you are feeling unhappy and bothered). She asks the children what 
would make them feel upset. “Would you feel upset getting the birthday present you’ve always wanted?”  “Would 
you feel upset if someone threw water on you?”  “Would that make you feel furious?”  “What else 
would make you furious?” Drake says, “I felt furious when my brother broke my toy”. Discussions 
like these continue over several days so the children hear and use the words in different ways.
Mrs. Smith has created a chart with the lines of patterned text. She has also written them 
on sentence strips and placed them in order in a pocket chart. After the children have read the 
sentences chorally on the chart, Mrs. Smith passes out the strips. As a group they put the sen-
tences back in order by comparing them to the chart. Then Mrs. Smith calls on volunteers to read 
sentences from the pocket chart and she observes carefully to see which children are beginning 
to point accurately to the words as they recite. On another day word cards for the animals are

held up one by one as volunteers come up to match the words to the chart or sentence strips. When Abby matches 
cow to cat Mrs. Smith says, “Yes they both start with C but look at the other letters. What do you hear at the end of 
cat?” She makes sure the book, chart, strips and words are left out where everyone can practise freely with them 
during the day.
Most of the children in Mrs. Smith’s class are ready to study initial consonants and she pulls a small group to do 
a picture sort. She begins by holding up the letter M and asks the group to find a word in the story that begins with 
that letter. They quickly find mat at the end of every sentence. She repeats with C. The children find cat and then 
cow. Mrs. Smith then brings out a collection of pictures that start with M and C and puts up a picture of a cat and a 
mat as headers in a pocket chart. After naming all the pictures, she models how to sort: “Here is a mouse. Listen to 
the first sound mmmmmmouse. Mouse starts like mat so I will put it under M”. After modelling several she invites 
the children to take turns sorting the rest. This sort is repeated, and on subsequent days the children have a number 
of opportunities to sort on their own, to hunt for more pictures in alphabet books and magazines beginning with 
M and C, and to draw and label pictures with those sounds. After the children compare the sounds in several ways, 
the pictures are combined with d (dog) and s (sat) for a four-category sort as shown in the opening picture of this  
chapter. The children work with all four letters and sounds for several days before moving on to a new contrast. ●
Figure 4.1  Pointing with Cat on the Mat
Mrs. Smith uses a core book as the basis for teaching a variety of emergent literacy skills in 
a developmentally appropriate fashion, starting with a whole text and working down to the 
parts (sentences, words, letters and sounds). Children practise reading five lines of the text to 
develop a concept of word in text. The five lines are written on individual sentence strips and 
children match the lines to their recitation of the lines. Children then focus on the words mat 
and cat to study beginning consonant sounds /m/ and /c/, and they sort pictures that begin 
with these sounds.

From Speech to Print: Matching Units  
of Speech to Print
Learning to read and spell is a process of matching oral and written language at three differ-
ent levels: (1) the discourse level, at which the text is organised into phrases and sentences, 
(2) the sentence level of words within sentences and (3) the word level of sounds and letters 
within words and syllables. For someone learning to read, mismatches occur because of the 
fixed nature of print versus the flowing stream of speech it represents.
The Discourse Level
In oral language, the discourse level includes the specific situation or context in which language 
is used and shared (Gee, 2005). It includes the “musical” level of language, usually consisting 
of sentences or phrases. Within these phrases, speakers produce and listeners hear elements of 
prosody such as expression, intonation contours and tone of voice, all of which communicate 
ideas and emotions. For example, a rising note at the end of a statement often indicates a ques-
tion; precise, clipped words in a brusque tone may suggest irritation or anger.
Oral language is a direct form of communication accompanied by gestures and facial expres-
sions that take place in a shared context, whereas written language is an indirect form of commu-
nication and must contain complete, freestanding messages to make meaning clear. Punctuation 
and word choice are often the reader’s only cues to the emotions and intent of the writer. In 
addition, written language tends to be more formal and carefully constructed, using literacy 
devices such as “happily ever after” to cue the reader. When children learn to read, they must 
match the prosody of their oral language to these more formal structures of written language.
The Word Level
A second level of structures that children must negotiate is the unit called words. In print, 
words are clearly set off with spaces between a string of letters. In speech, words are not dis-
tinct; there is no clear, separable unit in speech that equates perfectly to individual words. For 
example, the phrase “once upon a time” represents a single idea composed of four words and 
five syllables. Because of this, when children try to match their speech to print, they often miss 
the mark, as Lee does in her elephant story in Figure 4.5 (page 121). It takes exposure, expla-
nation and practice, as well as alphabet knowledge, to match words in speech to written words 
(Flanigan, 2006; Morris, 1980; Roberts, 1992; Uhry & Shepart, 1999; Uhry, 2002) which is 
why early childhood teachers should point to words as they read from charts or big books.
Sounds in Words
Sounds and letters make up the third level of analysis. In learning to read, children must seg-
ment the speech sounds or phonemes within words and match them to the letters in print. 
In speech, the phonemes (consonants and vowels) are interconnected and cannot be easily 
separated (Liberman & Shankweiler, 1991). Yet letters of the alphabet and individual speech 
sounds must be understood as discrete units that match in systematic ways in order to master 
reading and spelling English. This understanding is called the alphabetic principle.
Characteristics of the Emergent Stage  
of Reading and Spelling
Some emergent children may have well-developed language skills and know a great deal about 
stories and books; others may not. However, a certain level of proficiency in oral language is 
not a prerequisite for learning the alphabet or seeing printed words tracked in correspondence 

	 118	
CH AP TER 4
to speech. To withhold these essential components of the learning-to-read process would put 
them in double jeopardy. Besides putting them behind in language and story development, 
they also would be behind in acquiring the alphabetic principle. Children can develop oral 
language, learn about stories and learn about words, sounds and the alphabet simultaneously 
as teachers model reading and writing and encourage children to imitate and experiment.
Emergent Reading
Can children in the emergent stage read? Yes, but not in a conventional way. The emer-
gent child’s reading is best described as pretend reading or reading from memory, and 
both are valuable practices for movement into literacy. Pretend reading is basically a 
paraphrase or spontaneous retelling at the discourse level that children produce while 
turning the pages of a familiar book. In pretend reading, children pace their retelling to 
match the sequence of pictures and orchestrate dialogue and the voice and cadence of 
written language (Sulzby, 1986).
Memory reading is more exacting than pretend reading. Without knowing any better, 
it might sound as though a child was reading. It involves an accurate recitation of the text 
accompanied by pointing to the print in some fashion. Reading from memory helps children 
coordinate spoken language with print at the level of words, sounds and letters. Emergent 
children’s attempts to touch individual words while reading from memory are initially quite 
inconsistent and vague. Children gradually acquire directionality, realising that they should 
move left to right, top to bottom and end up on the last word on the page. However, the units 
that come in between are a blur until the systematic relationship between letters and sounds 
is understood. The ability to fingerpoint or track accurately to words in print while reading 
from memory is a phenomenon called concept of word in text (COW-T). It is a watershed 
event that separates the emergent reader from the letter name–alphabetic beginning reader 
(Flanigan, 2007; Henderson, 1981; Morris, 1992, 1993).
When children lack a COW-T, word boundaries are also missing in their writing, even 
if some phoneme–grapheme correspondences have been made. Note how the words all run 
together in Figure 4.2. However, words gradually begin to evolve as distinct entities with their 
boundaries defined by beginning and ending sounds as fingerpointing becomes more exact. 
Children’s early letter name–alphabetic writing provides evidence of this understanding, as 
illustrated in Figure 4.3.
Emergent readers are in what Ehri (1997) calls the prealphabetic phase of reading. They 
may learn to identify a few words, such as their names and the names of friends and family. They 
might also identify signs in their environment, but their strategy is to look for nonalphabetic 
cues such as the shape and colour of a stop sign. They may identify a large retail store because it 
starts with a big red K, but they are not systematic in their selection of any particular cue. Dur-
ing the emergent stage, children lack an understanding of the alphabetic principle or show only 
the beginning of this understanding even as they begin to notice letters. On entering preschool, 
Lee realised that other children’s names on their cubbies had some of the same letters that were

in her name. Perplexed and somewhat annoyed, she pointed to one of the letters. “Hey, that’s 
MY letter!” she insisted. Children in the emergent stage also begin to see some letters from 
their names in environmental print. Walking around the grocery store, Lee pointed to the box 
of Cheer detergent and said, “Look, Mommy! There’s my name!” Lee’s special relationship 
with the letters in her name is a living embodiment of the prealphabetic strategy.
Emergent Writing
Like emergent reading, early emergent writing is largely pretend. Regardless of most children’s 
cultural backgrounds or where they live, this pretend writing occurs spontaneously wherever 
writing is encouraged, modelled and incorporated into play (Ferreiro & Teberosky, 1982). The 
child’s first task as a writer is to discover that scribbling can represent something and, thereafter, 
to differentiate drawing from writing and pictorial representation from oral communication. The 
child must come to realise that a drawing of a flower does not actually say “flower”. Writing is 
necessary to communicate the complete message. Children in the early phases of the emergent 
stage experiment with symbolic forms while they are learning important concepts about print. 
The top row of Figure 4.4 presents a progression of drawings and their accompanying utterances.
There are many similarities between infant talk and emergent writing. When babies learn 
to talk, they do not begin by speaking in phonemes first, followed by syllables, words and 
finally phrases. In fact, it is quite the opposite. They begin by cooing in discourse, prosodic 
contours that approximate the music of their mother tongue. Likewise, children begin to 
write by approximating the broader contours of the writing system; they start with the linear 
arrangement of print (Ferreiro & Teberosky, 1982; Puranik, Lonigan & Kim, 2011). This kind 
of pretend writing has been called mock linear (Clay, 1975; Harste, Woodward & Burke, 
1984). However, unlike learning to talk, which evolves naturally, children must be taught to 
read and write.

CH AP TER 4
The bottom row of Figure 4.4 shows the movement from mock linear writing to real 
writing that uses letters to represent speech sounds. When children begin to represent speech 
sounds with letters of the alphabet, they are well on their way to acquiring the alphabetic 
principle, the foundation of the English writing system (Liberman, Shankweiler & Liberman, 
1986). Once children attain the alphabetic principle, they are no longer emergent learners.
As children develop across the emergent stage, there are dramatic changes that can be 
characterised as early, middle and late emergent behaviours, as summarised in Table 4.1.
Early.  In the early emergent stage, children learn to hold a pencil, marker or crayon 
and to make marks on paper (or windows, walls or floors). These marks are best described 
as scribbles that lack directionality and may not serve a communicative function. Sometime 
during this early emergent stage, scribbles evolve into more representational drawings and 
children learn that print is distinct from drawing.
Middle.  In the middle emergent stage, children begin to approximate the most global 
contours of the writing system: the top-to-bottom linear arrangement. They experiment with 
letterlike forms that resemble the separate circles and lines of manuscript writing or the con-
nected loops of cursive. The child may identify his or her efforts as “writing” and announce that 
it is a “note for Daddy”, as shown in Figure 4.4. Parents may be challenged at this point when 
children come to them with their pretend writing and say, “Read this to me, Mommy” or “What 
does this say?” What is exciting and significant is that young children recognise that print carries 
a message that can be read by others. As letters of the alphabet and numbers are learned, they 
begin to show up in letter strings or a “symbol salad”, as in the spelling of macaroni in Figure 4.4.
Late.  By the late emergent stage, children are beginning to use letters to represent speech 
sounds in a systematic way, as shown in the last box in Figure 4.4. This marks the acquisition 
of the alphabetic principle. These partial representations of sounds, or phonetic spellings, 
represent four critical insights and skills:
1.	 To produce a spelling, children must know some letters—not all, but enough to get 
started.
2.	 They must attend to the sounds or phonemes within spoken words and syllables.

3.	 They must know that letters represent speech sounds. Again, they do not have to know all 
of the letter sounds; indeed, if they know the names of the letters, they might use those 
as substitutes.
4.	 They must know how to form or write some of the letters they know.
Beginning to Match Sounds to Letters
To create a spelling, children must be able to isolate individual sounds in the word and apply 
their knowledge of letter names, or phonics, the systematic correspondence between letters 
and sounds. Initially, children are only able to discern the most prominent sound in a word or 
syllable, which they may represent with just one letter: K for cat, S for mouse, B for baby. The 
last box in Figure 4.4 shows some of these partial spellings.
Emergent children rely on the feel of their mouths as they analyse the speech stream. 
Say the phrase “once upon a time” aloud while paying attention to what your tongue and 
lips are doing. The tongue touches another part of the mouth only for the /s/ sound of once, 
the /n/ sound of upon and the /t/ sound of time. The lips touch each other twice: for the /p/ 
sound in the middle of upon and for the /m/ sound at the end of time. It is not surprising, 
therefore, that Lee wrote “once upon a time” as 1SPNTM in Figure 4.5. Late emergent 
spellers pay attention to those tangible points of an utterance in which one part of the 
mouth touches another, or to the most forcefully articulated sounds that make the most 
vibration or receive the most stress. If some letters are known, they will be matched to these 
prominent sounds.
Figure 4.5 illustrates Lee’s phonemic analysis of words and phrases in her elephant story 
relative to her knowledge of the alphabet and letter sounds. The phonemes represented by 
letters are always the most prominent 
sounds, but the most prominent are 
not always at the beginnings of words; 
she spelled went as T and him as M. 
Lee is not yet able to isolate every 
phoneme and her spellings reflect 
this partial awareness as in F for fair 
or TM for time. Notice her confusion 
with word boundaries and how she 
tries to mark them with periods. As 
children begin to achieve a concept 
of word, they become better able 
to pay attention to sounds that cor-
respond to the beginnings and ends 
of word units. When letter names are 
coordinated with word boundaries in 
a consistent fashion, the child is no 
longer an emergent speller. Spelling 
that honours word boundaries con-
sistently is spelling in the early part 
of the next stage, the letter name–­
alphabetic stage.
The Context for Early Literacy Learning
To make progress in the emergent stage, learners need lots of teacher-scaffolded experi-
ences with reading and writing for real purposes. These experiences should progress from 
­modelling and explanation by the teacher, to guided practice and then to independent practice

by the child in a gradual release model (Duffy, 2009; Fisher and Frey, 2008; Pearson &  
Gallagher, 1983):
1.	 Modelling and explanation: Beginning in preschool, look for opportunities to introduce 
new vocabulary, identify rhyming words, talk about letters and sounds, write for children 
and point to words in enlarged text as they read.
2.	 Guided practice: Ask children to sort pictures by beginning sounds, clap the syllables in 
words, recite poems and songs from memory, and add a question mark to a sentence, all 
under close supervision.
3.	 Independent practice: The most important condition for emergent literacy to blossom is 
the opportunity to practise, and children’s approximations must be encouraged and cel-
ebrated. After modelling and guided practice, children can then be expected to produce 
rhyming words, sort pictures by beginning sounds, write letters in attempts to spell and 
fingerpoint read short memorable selections of text.
Teaching children letters of the alphabet and the sounds they represent is absolutely 
essential during the emergent stage, but children do not have to get them all straight before 
they begin to read and write. Pretend writing and pretend reading come first, and as they 
evolve, real reading and real writing will follow.
Support Emergent Writing
The mere act of leaving one’s mark on paper has been called the “fundamental graphic act” 
(Gibson & Yonas, 1968)—an irresistible act of self-fulfilment. Young children will write, or 
pretend to write, well before they learn to read, provided they are encouraged to do so. The 
trick in developmental literacy instruction is how to give that encouragement. As the teacher, 
you should provide immediate and ready access to implements of writing (markers, crayons, 
pencils, chalk) and model how to use them. Children can write in centres:
• A grocery store play area where grocery lists are drawn and labelled
• A restaurant where menus are offered and orders are written
• A block centre with cardboard shapes for making signs
• A writing centre with a variety of paper, alphabet stamps, markers and 
pictures cut from magazines
You could also give children journals and encourage them to write in 
them. Figures 4.4 and 4.5 show samples of Lee’s daily preschool journal 
entries. For many young writers, their first efforts may be drawings accom-
panied by labels such as Kaitlyn’s kindergarten journal entry in Figure 4.6. 
In addition, writing extensions to other literacy activities and thematic stud-
ies can be modelled and encouraged. Children might record their obser-
vations of seeds growing, write about a field trip or record a prediction. 
Expect these efforts to range from scribbles to partial phonetic writing, as 
shown in Figure 4.4.
As described in the gradual release model, it is critical that teachers 
write for and with children to demonstrate and explain the forms and func-
tions of print. This can take place as they record students’ ideas in child 
dictations or during interactive writing when they make the writing pro-
cess explicit by talking aloud about how to spell, punctuate and compose 
(Aram & Biron, 2004; Button, Johnson & Furgerson, 1996). Outfitted and 
supported accordingly, writing will happen well before children can spell 
conventionally or properly compose (Chomsky, 1970; McGee & Richgels, 
2012; Strickland & Morrow, 1989).
In a developmental framework for early writing, what matters is ­engaging 
children in the process as the first step and as an incentive for learning 
more about the process. Cabell, Tortorelli and Gerde (2013) describe the 
Figure 4.6  Kaitlyn’s Kindergarten 
Journal in October

developmental learning trajectory for stu-
dents’ early writing as well as corresponding 
goals based on where they are develop-
mentally. Using this framework, teachers 
can interpret children’s writing and then 
provide the appropriate instruction to move 
to the next level. For example, children at 
the drawing and scribbling level will need 
instruction that walks them through the 
process of including letters in their writing. 
Children who already include letters and 
letterlike forms, but without a connection 
to speech sounds, will need instruction to 
use letters to represent the most prominent 
sounds. Teachers should help children who 
already write letters to represent one sound 
to focus on and represent both beginning 
and ending sounds of spoken words.
Support Emergent Reading
There are two kinds of reading formats for emergent learners: reading to students, which 
includes interactive read-alouds with children’s literature, and reading with students. Interac-
tive read-alouds (Barrentine, 1996) promote oral language discussions around vocabulary, 
ideas and concepts related to the content and genre of a book as teachers read aloud to chil-
dren. During shared reading (Holdaway, 1979) teachers read with students from enlarged 
texts like big books and charts on which children can see the print and join in chorally on 
rereadings. Both formats involve lots of modelling by the teacher and provide a supportive 
social context with opportunities to talk about the forms and functions of print. However, shared 
reading, in which students’ attention is directed to enlarged print, is particularly powerful for 
cultivating awareness of important aspects of how print works. Teachers can use print refer-
encing (Justice & Sofka, 2010), such as where to begin to read on the page, or demonstrate 
left-to-right directionality and the return sweep at the end of each line—conventions of written 
language known as concepts about print (CAP). Of course, all the talk and demonstration in 
the world will not substitute for hands-on practice, so early literacy instruction includes lots of 
guided practice with fingerpointing to familiar texts as Mrs. Smith did with Cat on the Mat. In the 
process, pretend or memory reading gradually moves children towards conventional reading.
The reading materials best suited for shared reading with emergent readers include simple 
predictable books, familiar nursery rhymes, poems, songs, jump rope jingles and children’s own 
talk written down. Familiarity with songs and rhymes helps bridge the gap between speech and 
print and cultivates the sense that what can be sung or recited can be written or read. Recording 
students’ own language in the form of picture captions and dictations also nurtures the notion 
that print is talk written down. The ownership that comes with having one’s own experiences 
recorded in print is a powerful incentive to explore the world of written language.
Although children in the emergent stage are heavily supported by memory in their first 
efforts to read, these attempts are nonetheless valuable. The best way to create a reader is to 
make reading happen, even if it is just pretend. Useful techniques for fostering early literacy 
development include the whole-to-part model (McCracken & McCracken, 1995) used by 
Mrs. Smith in the opening vignette. The whole-to-part model begins with the shared read-
ing of familiar rhymes and jingles (whole texts). Then follow-up activities move to the parts 
(sentences, words, letters and sounds) as children rebuild the text with sentence strips in 
pocket charts, and match word cards to individual words on the sentence strips as an explicit 
way to direct attention to words in print. The smallest parts involve sorting pictures and 
words by beginning sounds to draw attention to letter–sound correspondences.

The Literacy Diet for the Emergent Stage
Through reading and writing activities, word study instruction for the emergent reader must 
aim towards the development of six fundamental components that constitute a comprehensive 
“diet” for early literacy learning and instruction (Invernizzi, 2002):
1.	 Oral language, concepts and vocabulary
2.	 Phonological awareness (PA)
3.	 Alphabet knowledge
4.	 Letter–sound knowledge
5.	 Concepts about print (CAP)
6.	 Concept of word in text (COW-T)
If all components are addressed on a daily basis, no matter how far along the emergent con-
tinuum a child may be, conventional reading and writing should inevitably follow. At the same 
time, Common Core State Standards (CCSS) will be met. In the sections that follow, each 
component is described with teaching tips. The literacy diet and activities are covered more 
thoroughly for early childhood educators in Words Their Way for PreK–K (Johnston, Invernizzi, 
Helman, Bear & Templeton, 2015).
Oral Language, Concepts and Vocabulary
Most children have an oral vocabulary of 13,000 words by the time they enter kindergarten 
(Justice, 2006), and have mastered the basic subject–verb–object word order of the English 
language. But children come to school with widely varying language experiences (Biemiller & 
Slonim, 2001). In a classic study, researchers estimated that by 3 years of age, some children 
had heard 3 million more words than other children, and by the time they enter school, some 
children have heard 30 million more words than others (Hart & Risley, 1995).
A well-developed vocabulary is an essential part of school success and explicit instruc-
tion is needed (Biemiller, 2001, 2004). To help children develop the deep and wide vocabu-
lary knowledge they will need to succeed in their future academic studies, vocabulary 
and language learning must become an integral part of all aspects of the early childhood 
classroom. There are many strategies to build a language-rich environment that will sup-
port students’ vocabularies, advancing oral language and concept development. Here we 
describe how daily classroom interactions can be a context for word learning—how to get 
children talking and using language, how to use read-alouds and how to develop big ideas 
and language through concept sorts. Activities 4.1 through 4.7 at the end of the chapter 
provide more ideas.
Classroom Interactions for Language Development.  Adults 
should engage children in conversation at every opportunity and consciously use language 
that includes new vocabulary and complex sentences. Sit with them at snack time, at lunchtime 
and on the playground, and ask them questions that will engage them in conversations. At the 
same time, children need many opportunities to talk with each other. Peer interactions are 
particularly important for children with less language skill because they benefit from conver-
sation with children who have better language skills (Mashburn, Justice, Downer & Pianta, 
2009). This is also true for children who are learning English.
Sophisticated Synonyms.  Be on the lookout for, gradually teach and consis-
tently use more sophisticated synonyms for the common language of everyday routines 
as well as for topical interests. For example, children can be asked to distribute or allocate 
materials. During discussions, encourage participants to contribute and elaborate their ideas 
and those of others. Children may be asked to assemble adjacent to the wall, and then to pro-
ceed in an orderly fashion. Lane and Allen (2010) describe how a kindergarten teacher begins 
the year by asking the “weather watcher” to report to the class using terms such as sunny,

125
cloudy or warm but she gradually introduces new terms—the appointed “meteorologist” is 
expected to observe the weather conditions and report the forecast using words such as overcast, 
brisk or frigid.
Language in Centres.  Centres provide a stimulus for new vocabulary and concept 
development. Sand is gritty and moist and can be sifted with sieves. In the block centre, encour-
age children to construct, erect and dismantle their creations. McGee and Richgels (2012) sug-
gest keeping a list of words posted in centres as a reminder of vocabulary to use with students. 
Add to the lists as more words occur to you and save them from year to year.
Targeting Vocabulary in Read-Alouds
Books expose children to new words and more complex sentence structures, and they provide 
background and conceptual knowledge that children may not have experienced first-hand. 
Read from a variety of genres and select storybooks that offer rich language and themes 
appropriate for young children. For example, nonfiction about seasons, weather, transporta-
tion and how seeds grow provides new vocabulary and develops background information, 
especially when read for units of study. Folktales offer strong plots that help children develop 
a sense of story and poetry offers rhyme and playful language.
Reading aloud to children exposes them to a wide range of new words, but teachers also 
need to develop the meanings of particular words in more depth to ensure vocabulary growth. 
When new words are introduced with a simple explanation, children should be asked to repeat 
them and say them in phrases and sentences. After reading about how a little bear hustled after his 
mother (Blueberries for Sal by Robert McCloskey), you might pause briefly to draw attention to 
the word and then follow up later with more discussion: “Hustle means to walk very quickly. Say 
the word hustle. Would you hustle to catch the bus? Would you hustle to bed? Would you hustle 
fast or hustle slow? Tell your partner how you would fill in this sentence: I hustled to 
”. 
Beck, McKeown and Kucan (2002, 2008) describe how to plan repeated exposure to words in 
different contexts to help children learn the meanings and uses of new vocabulary words. For 
example, you might urge the children to hustle as they line up to go inside.
Selecting Words.  Review books to select vocabulary to develop. It is easy and tempt-
ing to simply look for hard words, but the most difficult examples may not be the words chil-
dren are most likely to retain and use on their own. Four criteria are important in selecting 
target words: (1) utility, (2) concreteness, (3) repetition in text and (4) relatedness to themes 
or topics of study.
Utility.  When thinking about utility, consider words that can be used regularly in the class-
room or words that will show up in other books. For example, the book Corduroy by Don 
Freeman includes “amazing, admiring and enormous”. After focussing on these words during 
the read-aloud, make a point of using them in other contexts. Instead of saying, “I like the 
drawing you did”, substitute with “I admire your drawing. The colours are amazing and that 
house is enormous!”
Concreteness.  Concrete words are more likely to be illustrated in the story (such as the 
elevator in Corduroy). Many denote concepts that children can act out, like hustled. Abstract 
words like imagined will take more work to develop.
Repetition in Text.  Also consider words that are used more than once in the story, because 
these will offer repeated exposure in a meaningful context. The word hustled occurs several 
times in Blueberries for Sal (McCloskey, 1948).
Thematic or Topical Relatedness.  When considering thematic or topical relatedness, 
choose words that can be clustered in a semantic category (Whitehurst, 1979). The words buds, 
blooms and blossoms all relate to the growing seeds motif in The Tree (A First Discovery Book). 
From the same book, other concrete selections that form clusters for repetition include seed, 
roots and sapling.

Interactive Reading.  Reading to children should be an interactive process that 
stimulates lots of responses from children who ask questions and provide comments such as 
pointing out things they notice in the illustrations (Barrentine, 1996). Ideas for planning and 
conducting an interactive read-aloud with a focus on vocabulary development can be found in 
Activity 4.1. Such read-alouds take additional time to implement because you want children to 
have the opportunity to engage in a lot of oral language. At the same time, excessive interrup-
tions can disrupt the flow of the text, so it is important to strike a balance between stopping and 
reading. Sometimes you may want to read a book with few, if any, interruptions and sometimes 
you may use a second reading to focus on words and invite responses. To increase opportunities 
to talk, you might want to use the “turn and talk” technique described in the activity section. 
Children talk with assigned partners to answer a question, share a response or make a predic-
tion. Turn and talk techniques multiply the opportunities for individuals to articulate their own 
ideas and are especially beneficial for children who are shy or learning to speak English.
Experiences and Extensions.  Reading aloud to children provides virtual 
experiences that can stimulate oral language and vocabulary learning, but real experi-
ences with cooking, science experiments, special visitors, classroom pets and field trips 
are ­particularly engaging and provide direct opportunities for verbal interactions. These 
experiences will be particularly important for English learners, but the immediacy of real 
life is engaging for all young children. It is easy to think that experiences and conversa-
tions just happen, and to a certain extent they do, but planned experiences with careful 
attention to vocabulary, language and concepts are more likely to be fruitful (Neuman & 
Roskos, 2012). Even better, combining read-alouds with experiences supports the nec-
essary repetition of targeted vocabulary and promotes linkages that facilitate learning. 
Because it is important for children to encounter new words and concepts in different 
contexts, planning experiences that promote vocabulary learning and help maintain that 
vocabulary over time is critical.
Let’s say you conduct a series of read-alouds on animals that make good pets, and you 
decide to get a hamster for the classroom. Some of the concepts and vocabulary that you can 
develop and sustain include hamster, male, female, habitat, nutrition, diet, exercise, bedding, gnaw 
and nocturnal. These words represent conceptual understandings you can develop about ham-
sters that children can then use in their daily conversations about hamsters.
Use the same criteria outlined earlier to select words: utility, concreteness, opportuni-
ties for repetition and relatedness. An experience like caring for a classroom pet can lead to 
lots of reading and writing activities as well. You might create labels with the students’ help 
for the cage, water bottle, exercise ball and so on. Children might dictate their observations 
and insights about hamsters in the language experience approach described beginning on 
page 141 or participate in an interactive writing activity described on page 163. In addition, 
you might ask children to illustrate and write about hamsters in their own journals.
Planned Extensions.  Follow-up activities to a read-aloud offer opportunities for children to 
interact with peers and apply their understanding of concepts and vocabulary through coop-
erative learning formats or centres (Wasik, Bond & Hindman, 2006). Reread favourites and 
then always keep the books available so children can pick them up during free time to explore 
on their own.
Retellings and Dramatic Play.  Prompting children to retell what they heard in the read-
aloud encourages them to use new words and more complex sentence constructions in hands-
on, engaging activities (Ward, 2009). Retellings should be modelled for students: “When you 
have a chance to look at this book on your own, try to retell the story. Watch how I do that 
by looking at the pictures”. Proceed to retell the story using the pictures and your memory 
of the words.
An intervention known as dialogic reading is a well-researched approach to reading 
aloud that is designed to stimulate oral language and dialogue while enhancing students’ abil-
ity to retell stories (Doyle & Bramwell, 2006; Whitehurst, Arnold, Epstein, Angell, Smith &  
Fischel, 1994). Studies of dialogic reading have demonstrated growth in expressive and

127
receptive language when used by parents and teachers of at-risk preschoolers (Justice & 
­Pullen, 2003; NELP, 2008). Instructional guidelines to enhance students’ ability to retell sto-
ries through questioning, modelling and recitation are described in Activity 4.2 at the end of 
this chapter. You might find that they are even happier to do a retelling when they can record 
themselves and listen to it afterwards.
Use dramatic play to act out stories or parts of stories under adult direction to get lots 
of children actively involved as actors or audience. Brainstorm with children about which 
characters are needed and what each one will do, and then walk through the dramatisation by 
posing questions and prompting oral responses. You can also stimulate retellings by supplying 
props like puppets, flannel board cutouts, objects used in the story (such as three bowls for 
the three bears) or plastic figures. Stick puppets are easy to make by simply copying pictures 
of characters or objects from the book, adding some colour, cutting around them and gluing 
them to popsicle sticks. After modelling the use of props or puppets as a group activity, they 
can be placed in a centre or made available during free time.
Concept Sorts.  The human mind appears to work by using compare-and-contrast 
categorisation to develop concepts and relationships among objects and attributes. By rec-
ognising similarities among items, it is possible to create groups or categories according to 
meaningful associations, the foundation of critical thinking (Gillet & Kita, 1979). The ability 
to categorise demonstrates maturing hierarchical and associative thinking, but needs to be 
coupled with conversation about why and how objects and pictures are being categorised 
(Carpenter, 2010). Concept sorts can be used at all levels of development as children catego-
rise objects, pictures, words or phrases.
Concept sorts can develop deeper understanding about words and how they relate to 
other words within a semantic field. For example, most 5-year-olds know about tables, chairs, 
sofas, beds, ovens, refrigerators, microwaves and blenders, but in their minds, these may be 
all undifferentiated “things in a house”. Teachers can help to expand students’ understanding 
of “things in a house” by introducing two different conceptual categories—furniture (tables, 
chairs, sofas and beds) and appliances (refrigerators, ovens, microwaves and blenders). Discus-
sion can focus on how appliances are different from furniture, such as the fact that appliances 
require “electricity” and need to be plugged into “receptacles”. Basic concept development 
tasks are a surprisingly simple way to expand students’ word knowledge, and they are also a 
good way to engage English learners and get them involved in verbal interactions (Bear & 
Helman, 2004).
You can use concept sorts to extend interactive read-alouds and provide additional 
exposure to new vocabulary. For example, after listening to Ruth Heller’s book Chickens 
Aren’t the Only Ones, provide children with picture cards to sort into groups of birds, mam-
mals and reptiles. In this way, they build on a simple conceptual understanding of where 
eggs come from to include other attributes of the animal kingdom. Concept sorts based on 
daily life experiences and information gleaned from books develop and expand students’ 
understandings of their world and the language to talk about it. For example, during a unit 
on animals, you can introduce children to a concept sort such as the one shown in Figure 4.7.
The concept sorts described in the activities section of this chapter are all variations on 
the theme of categorisation tasks. In addition to basic sorting, concept development activi-
ties are generally followed by draw-and-label or cut-and-paste procedures, as described in 
­Chapter 3. As always, we recommend having children write at every possible opportunity 
during or following the concept sorts. For example, as a culminating activity for a unit on 
animals, one kindergarten teacher helped her children create their own books in which they 
drew pictures of their favourite animals. When asked to label these pictures or write briefly 
about the animals, her children’s efforts ranged from random letters to readable approxima-
tions such as “I LIK THE LINS N TGRS”.
To provide additional practice saying and hearing new words, encourage children to 
name the pictures as they sort and to justify their placements as they describe their categories 
(“Why did you put a bear with the wild animals?”). If the pictures used in concept sorts reflect 
words that are new to students, they need to be explicitly taught. It is important to talk about

the meanings of words and use them 
it repeatedly each time they appear 
in sorting. It might be an opportune 
time to discuss the meaning of claw 
or hoof when sorting pictures of birds 
and ­animals. English learners may 
need to learn the names of more com-
mon objects, like bird or cow.
Assessing and Monitor-
ing Vocabulary Growth.  
Use instructional activities that 
extend interactive read-alouds, such 
as retellings and concept sorts, to 
measure 
progress 
in 
students’ 
vocabulary growth. Note increases 
in word use or tally the number of 
ideas, facts or concepts children 
express when retelling or explaining 
the sort. Retell assessments are 
authentic, valid and reliable means 
of assessing understanding (Fuchs, 
Fuchs & Maxwell, 1988). Noting 
the number of objects, pictures or 
items correctly sorted into concep-
tual categories also yields a reliable 
means of assessing depth of recep-
tive vocabulary (Ward, 2009). Other 
developmentally appropriate ways 
of assessing receptive vocabulary growth in emergent learners include pointing to pictures 
that answer direct questions (e.g., “Which picture is the veterinarian?”) or answering sets 
of yes/no questions (e.g., “Is an acorn a seed?” “Do plants grow from seeds?” “Do all seeds 
look the same?”).
Phonological Awareness
The ability to pay attention to, identify and reflect on various sound segments of speech is 
known as phonological awareness (PA). It is the umbrella term for a range of understand-
ings about speech sounds, including syllables, rhyme and a sense of alliteration. Phonemic 
awareness is a subcategory of phonological awareness and refers to the ability to identify 
and reflect on the smallest units of sound: individual phonemes. The ability to segment sit 
or thick into three sounds (/s/-/i/-/t/ or /th/-/i/-/ck/) is an example of phonemic awareness. 
Children can hear and use individual phonemes easily at a tacit level—they can talk and 
can understand when others talk to them. But it is not easy to bring tacit, subconscious 
awareness of abstract individual phonemes to the surface to be examined consciously and 
explicitly.

Phonological awareness and phonemic awareness are widely identified as critical under-
standings needed to progress in literacy (Ball & Blachman, 1988; Ehri & Roberts, 2006; 
National Reading Panel, 2000). This is because children need a certain amount of phonemic 
awareness to grasp the alphabetic nature of English; understanding beginning sounds will 
get them started. Thereafter, phonemic awareness, word recognition, decoding and spelling 
continue to develop in a symbiotic fashion. Growth in one area stimulates growth in another 
(Ehri, 2006; Morris et al., 2003; Perfetti, Beck, Bell & Hughes, 1987).
Phonological awareness develops gradually over time and progresses from a sensitivity to 
big chunks of speech sounds, such as syllables and rhyme, to smaller parts of speech sounds, 
such as individual phonemes (Pufpaff, 2009; Pullen & Justice, 2003; Ziegler & Goswami, 
2005). Early emergent learners might participate in phonological awareness activities that 
focus attention on syllables and rhyming words, whereas middle emergent learners may also 
easily grasp alliteration by sorting pictures that begin with the same sound. Find opportuni-
ties throughout the day to talk about a variety of speech units—have children line up by the 
number of syllables in their own name or listen for the beginning sound in the title of a book. 
As you draw children’s attention to units of sound, familiarise them with terms such as word, 
rhyme, syllable and beginning sound.
Using a variety of instructional strategies that are identified as successful and effective, 
phonological awareness activities can be engaging whole-group language activities that ben-
efit all students (Blachman, 1994, 2000; Lundberg, Frost & Peterson, 1988; Smith, Simmons 
& Kame’enui, 1995). These activities need not be conducted as isolated tasks, nor do they 
need to take up a lot of time. According to some estimates, an entire year of phonemic aware-
ness instruction need not exceed 20 hours (Armbruster, Lehr & Osborn, 2001). The activity 
section of this chapter has many suggestions, and additional resources are listed in Resource 
Connections below.

Children achieve partial phonemic awareness at the very end of the emergent phase of 
literacy development when they can isolate consonant sounds at the beginnings (and some-
times ends) of words and syllables. They develop full phonemic awareness during the letter 
name–alphabetic stage as they learn to separate all the sounds in a word, including blends 
and medial vowels (/s/-/t/-/e˘/-/p/). We can see the development of phonemic awareness in 
children’s spelling of slide as it moves from partial (S or SD) to developing (SID or SLD) to 
full (SLID). The following sections discuss different aspects of phonological awareness. You 
can find related activities for each in the activity section (4.8 to 4.19) at the end of the chapter, 
and at the PALS website of the University of Virginia.
Syllables and Words.  Young children are concrete thinkers, so it is not surpris-
ing that they associate the length of a word with the size of its referent. Although caterpillar 
is a fairly long word, it refers to a relatively small insect, and so young children may think 
the word caterpillar is smaller than the word cat, because cats are bigger than caterpillars 
(Papandropoulou & Sinclair, 1974; Templeton & Spivey, 1980). This is no “small” confusion 
because to learn to read it is necessary to pay attention to the word’s sound independently 
of its meaning.
Building phonological sensitivity in young children is complicated by the fact that words 
are made up of more than one syllable. A first step in leading children to an awareness of 
spoken words as a unit is to take two concrete “short” words and make them into one “long” 
compound word (e.g., snow, man, snowman). Although the emphasis in building phonological 
sensitivity is on the sounds of words, there can be a productive interplay between sound and 
meaning.
Rhymes, Jingles and Songs.  Rhyme awareness activities are an easy, natural way 
for children to play with words and to begin to focus on speech sounds. Songs, jingles, nurs-
ery rhymes and poems fill students’ ears with the sounds of rhyme. Many children develop 
a sense of rhyme easily, whereas others need more structured activities that draw their 
attention specifically to rhyming words. The first step is to talk about the rhyming words 
in favourite and familiar books, songs and poems. Some lend themselves to an activity in 
which you simply pause and let the children supply the second rhyming word in a couplet. 
A picture book such as Is Your Mama a Llama? by Deborah Guarina or “I Can’t”, said the 
Ant by Polly Cameron have illustrations and clues to help children name the rhyme. Some 
other favourite rhyming books are listed in the activities section at the end of this chapter.
You can follow rhyming book read-alouds with picture sorts for rhymes. For example, 
an extension to “I Can’t”, said the Ant is matching pictures of objects named in the book 
with other rhyming pictures. To make it easier for beginners, lay out 
just two pictures that rhyme along with one that does not. This odd-
one-out setup, shown in Figure 4.8, enables children to identify more 
­readily the two rhyming pictures.
Songs are naturally full of rhythm and rhyme and hold great appeal 
for children. Several songs recorded by Raffi, a popular singer and 
songwriter for children, are particularly well suited for language play. 
For example, rhyme features prominently in the song “Willoughby 
Wallaby Woo” from the collection Singable Songs for the Very Young. 
The song features a rhyme starting with W for everyone’s name and 
can be easily adapted for the children in your class. Sing the initiating 
phrase, changing the first letter of a name to W (“Willoughby Wallaby 
Wackie”), then children sing the next phrase, naming the appropriate 
classmate (“An elephant sat on Jackie”). You can pass a stuffed elephant 
to the child to add to the fun. Change the song to focus on alliteration 
by holding up a particular letter to insert in front of every word. B, 
for example, results in “Billaby Ballaby Boo”, and F produces “Fillaby 
­Fallaby Foo”.

English learners may not understand rhyming in English. In Spanish, for example, 
rhyming focusses on the stress and vowels in words of more than one syllable, whereas in 
English rhyming focusses more on one-syllable word endings. Expect that developing a 
sense of rhyme in English may take a little longer to master for English learners than native 
speakers.
As children become more adept at listening for rhymes, they can play a variety of sorting 
and matching games. Traditional games such as Bingo, Lotto and Concentration, in which 
picture cards are matched to other picture cards that rhyme, are always winners.
Alliteration and Beginning Sounds.  Children must become aware that 
speech can be divided into smaller segments of sound—phonemic awareness—before they 
will advance in literacy. They must also learn some of the terminology used to talk about 
these sounds. Without this knowledge, instruction in phonics will have little success. Children 
have no trouble hearing sounds, but directions such as “Listen for the first sound” may mys-
tify them. In response to the question, “What sound does cow start with?” one puzzled child 
tentatively replied, “Moo?” Without a stable concept of word in text, “first sound” is a relative 
notion. Use phonological awareness activities at the emergent level to help children attend to 
sounds, and learn to label and categorise these sounds in various ways.
Activities that play with alliteration focus students’ attention on the beginning sounds. 
Start with ABC books such as Dr Seuss’s ABC, which celebrates alliteration in the famous 
Seuss style. Play beginning-sound games with puppets or stuffed animals. Use games such as 
I Spy or I’m Thinking of Something to accentuate the initial sound. “This thing I’m thinking 
of begins with mmmmm. This thing is small and grey. It is an animal”. As the children respond 
“mouse” or “mole”, ask them to exaggerate the beginning sound. As children become profi-
cient at playing this game, they create their own riddles.
Alliteration is further developed as children sort pictures by beginning sound under a 
corresponding letter, an activity that will be described in detail shortly. At this point, oral lan-
guage activities designed to teach phonemic awareness cross over into learning letter–sound 
correspondences, or phonics.
Assessing and Monitoring Phonological Awareness.  You can 
find a collection of assessments that cover different aspects of phonological awareness at the 
PDToolkit: syllable, rhyme and phonemic awareness of initial consonants (alliteration). In 
general, a score of 80 percent is considered sufficient mastery of a task.
Phonological awareness tasks similar to these have been scientifically validated by 
Invernizzi and her colleagues, with thousands of children screened in Virginia with Phono-
logical Awareness Literacy Screening (PALS) assessments at the preschool and kindergarten 
levels (Invernizzi et al., 2006). Monitoring the development of phonological awareness during 
kindergarten helps to identify children who need additional instruction.
Alphabet Knowledge
Among the reading readiness skills that are traditionally studied, letter naming appears to be 
the strongest predictor of later reading success (NELP, 2008; Snow, Burns & Griffin, 1998). 
There is a great deal to learn about the alphabet. Letters have names, a set sequence, sounds and 
upper- and lowercase forms. They must be written in particular ways, and directional orienta-
tion is vital. In the three-dimensional world, a chair is a chair whether you approach it from the 
front or the back, from the left or the right. Not so with letters: A b is a b and a d is a d. Print is 
one of the few things in life in which direction makes a difference and young children lack this 
directionality. They also confuse letters that share visual features: S may be mistaken for Z, E 
for F, h for n and so forth (Clay, 1975; Ehri & Roberts, 2006). In addition, children must learn 
to recognise the distinguishing but stable characteristics of letters across different fonts, sizes, 
shapes and textures, as shown in ­Figure 4.9. Children form an abstract concept of B from seeing 
such variations and encountering B in many contexts.

Learning the names of the letters is an important first step 
towards learning the sounds associated with the letters. Most of the 
letters have names that include a sound commonly associated with 
it and can serve as mnemonic devices for remembering the sounds 
(Huang, Tortorelli & Invernizzi, 2014; Kim, Petscher, Foorman & 
Zhou, 2010). B (bee), K (kay) and Z (zee) have their sounds at the 
beginnings of their names, whereas F (eff), L (ell) and S (ess) have 
their sounds at the end. The names of the vowels are their long 
sounds. Only H (aitch), W (doubleyou) and the consonant Y (wie) 
have no sound association, and not surprisingly these letters are often 
the most difficult to learn. Letter names serve as the first reference 
point many children use when writing and explain some of the inter-
esting invented spellings they create during the letter name–alpha-
betic stage, discussed more in the next chapter.
Most mainstream middle-class children take five years to acquire 
all this alphabet knowledge at home and in preschool. Magnetic let-
ters  on the refrigerator door, alphabetic puzzles and commercial 
alphabet games are staples in many middle-class homes (Adams, 1990). There is also an 
increasingly broad range of apps many parents use to develop alphabet and letter–sound 
knowledge. Truly advantaged children also have attentive parents at the kitchen table, mod-
elling letter formation and speech segmentation as they encourage their child to write a 
grocery list or a note to Grandma; others have less preparation. The best way to share five 
years of accumulated alphabet knowledge with children who have not had these experiences 
is to teach it directly, in as naturalistic, fun and game like a manner as possible (Delpit, 1988).
Teaching the Alphabet.  The alphabet is learned the same way that concepts and 
words for concepts are learned—through actively exploring the relationships between let-
ter names, the sounds of the letter names, their visual characteristics and the motor move-
ment involved in their formation. Alphabet games and activities are designed to develop all 
aspects of alphabet knowledge, including letter naming, letter recognition (both uppercase 
and lowercase), letter writing and letter sounds. Many alphabet activities begin with the 
child’s name—building it with letter tiles, cutting it out of play dough or matching it letter 
for letter with a second set. Writing or copying their own names and the names of other 
family members or friends is alluring to emergent writers, making a great introduction to 
the alphabet as well as to writing. Letters take on personalities: M is Manuel’s letter and T 
is Tonisha’s letter.
The following list provides some general routines for teaching children about the forms 
and functions of the alphabet. See the Activities 4.20–4.30 at the end of this chapter for more 
detail, as well as games that include traditional formats like Bingo and Concentration.
• Teach the letter sequence by singing the alphabet song daily until children know it by 
heart. In addition, point to the letters as they sing and then give children a copy of the 
alphabet strip so they can practise pointing and finding letters as they are named.
• Share alphabet books with students, pointing out the capital and lowercase forms and 
naming the pictures that begin with a letter. Children typically learn capital letters first, 
but by kindergarten lowercase letters are needed; teach them together along with the 
sounds associated with them.
• Make alphabet books available for children to explore on their own but model for chil-
dren how to use them independently: “Here is the capital B and the lowercase b. Bear and 
bowl begin with b”. (See a list of alphabet books in the activity section.)
• Children’s names provide a meaningful context for studying specific letters (Cunningham, 
2005). Studying a name each day is a more appropriate pace than letter of the week in kin-
dergarten classrooms (see Activity 4.23). Children should use their names to participate 
in daily activities, such as signing in each day for attendance and lunch choices, or signing 
up for centres or popular tasks like feeding the fish. Start by providing preprinted name 
cards but move towards expecting children to write out their names.

• Point out letters on signs, in book titles, on charts and all around the school. The modern 
world is full of letters, but you need to draw students’ attention to them and name them. 
When you read and write with children there are endless opportunities to talk about let-
ters; this helps them understand the many functions letters serve.
• Create an alphabet centre where children have access to puzzles and games that change 
on a regular basis. Also, provide an alphabet strip and a variety of writing implements 
(markers, chalk, rubber stamps) and surfaces (paper, card stock, chalkboards, whiteboards, 
Magna Doodles, etc.) to encourage children to write and form their letters. Handwriting 
is an important and often neglected component of early literacy instruction (Graham, 
Harris & Fink, 2000). Teach children how to write the letters and provide various ways to 
create letters out of clay, pipe cleaners or cookie dough. Have children trace textured let-
ters, make letters in trays filled with sand, or glue down rice, pasta or beans in the shapes 
of letters. When teaching letter formation, be consistent about spatial matters such as 
where to start and directionality. Have children vocalise these movements as they form 
their letters (e.g., “up, down, up, down” for M; “around” for O) and also repeat the letter 
names as they trace them.
Assessing and Monitoring Growth in Alphabet ­Knowledge.  Use 
a variety of tasks to determine how much instruction is needed for learning letters. Ask chil-
dren to point to and recite the letters in order as a first step. Watch how they handle LMNOP—
because of the way these letters are sung in the alphabet song, sometimes they become one 
letter! Present upper- and lowercase letters in random order to assess letter recognition; alphabet 
recognition assessments are included on the PDToolkit website. You can easily assess letter 
production by calling out letters, in or out of order, for children to write. According to research 
conducted with hundreds of thousands of kindergartners in Virginia, kindergartners are able to 
recognise and name an average of 20 lowercase letters, presented in random order in the fall of 
the year and nearly all of them by the end of kindergarten (Invernizzi et al., 2006). Longitudinal 
research suggests that kindergarten children who name fewer than 12 lowercase letters in the fall 
of the year would benefit from additional instruction to prevent falling further behind. Alphabet 
learning is easy to monitor; assess children regularly to plan instruction for those who are not 
making progress.
Letter–Sound Knowledge and Phonics
During the emergent stage, children learn their letters, develop phonemic awareness and 
begin to make connections between letters and sounds as they come to understand the alpha-
betic principle in spelling. Towards the end of the emergent stage, many children will begin 
producing partial phonetic spellings that contain one or two letters for each syllable (see Fig-
ure 4.3, page 118). Sorting pictures by beginning sounds secures these tentative efforts and 
moves children along in acquiring more knowledge of letter–sound correspondences through 
a game like, manipulative phonics activity.
Letters such as M and S are appropriate for students’ first consonant contrast because 
both letters have continuant sounds that can be isolated and elongated without undue distor-
tion (mmmmoon and ssssun). The sounds also feel very different in the mouth during articula-
tion, which makes it easier for children to judge the categories while sorting. The sound for 
B (/b/) cannot be elongated or isolated without adding a vowel to it (buh), but it is still fairly 
easy to learn, perhaps because it has a distinctive feel as the lips press together and also because 
it is one of the earliest consonantal phonemes acquired during oral language development 
(Pense & Justice, 2008). However, contrasting B and P in an early sort is confusing because 
they are both articulated or produced the same way (Purcell, 2002). The only difference is that 
the /b/ sound causes the vocal cords to vibrate whereas /p/ does not. Try placing two fingers 
on your larynx and feel the difference in voiced /b/ and unvoiced /p/ as you say bay and pay.
Table 4.2 shows a pronunciation chart of consonants. Read across each row saying the 
sound of the letter (i.e., /p/, /b/, /m/) to see how those sounds share the same place of articula-
tion (i.e., lips together). Compare the voiced and unvoiced pairs such as /f/ and /v/ or /t/ and /d/.

Notice how the nasal sounds of /m/, /n/ and /ng/ pass through the nose rather than the mouth. 
As teachers, learning about articulation may seem unnecessarily complicated, but it explains 
so many of the interesting things children do in their invented spellings during the emergent 
and letter name–alphabetic stages. Use the chart to see the logic in the invented spelling JP for 
chip, VN for fan and PD for pet. In each case, the substitutions vary only because one is voiced 
and the other is unvoiced. Otherwise, they are articulated exactly the same way. Knowing about 
articulation helps you make decisions about setting up picture sorts. The letters in any row will 
feel very much alike and are best not contrasted in the very first letter–sound sorts. Remember 
the principle of word study highlighted in Chapter 3—begin with obvious contrasts!
English learners are often unfamiliar with many of the sounds of English and will substi-
tute sounds and letters closest to their primary languages and alphabets. They will not articu-
late some sounds at first, but their substitutions are logical. For example, Spanish speakers may 
use the letter v to represent the /b/ sound because these sounds are the same in Spanish. The 
logic behind the misspellings of English learners was discussed in Chapter 2, and more detail 
will be provided in Chapter 5.
Guidelines for Beginning Sound Picture Sorts.  There are a number 
of factors to keep in mind when organising sorts for beginning letter sounds.
• Start with meaningful text. Choose several sounds to contrast that represent key words from 
a familiar rhyme, patterned book (such as C and M from Cat on the Mat) or dictation.
• Make sorts easier or harder as needed. Start with two obvious contrasts and then add one or 
two for up to four categories. Look for fast and accurate picture sorting before moving 
on. Be ready to drop back to fewer categories if a child has difficulty.
• Use a key picture and a letter as headers. Using a key picture and a letter as a header helps 
children associate the letter and the sound. The headers may be letters or words selected 
from familiar text. Suggestions for key pictures are on the sound boards in Appendix B. 
Whatever key word you select, be consistent and use the same one every time.
• Begin with teacher-directed sorts. Discuss both the sound and the letter name, and model the 
placement of two or three pictures in each category. Be explicit about why you sort the 
way you do. Say, for example, “Map, mmmmap, mmmat. Map and mat start with the same 
sound. I will put map under the letter M”. Over time, as children catch on to what it is 
you want them to do, you can use fewer directives. The opening photo on page 114 shows 
how a sort would look after sorting. You can find pictures for sorting in Appendix C; these 
can be enlarged for group modelling.

• Use sets of pictures that are easy to name and sort. Introduce the picture names to be sure 
that children know what to call them. Use easily identified pictures that do not start with 
consonant blends or digraphs. Single-syllable words are better than two-syllable words 
because they have fewer sounds that need attention.
• Correct mistakes on the first sort but allow errors to wait on subsequent sorts. Show children how 
to check their sorts by naming the pictures down the columns, emphasising the beginning 
sounds. Then ask if there are any pictures that need to be changed. Tell children to check 
their own work using the same process and praise them when they find their own errors. 
If they do not, prompt them by saying, “There is a picture in this row that needs to be 
changed. Can you find it?”
• Vary the group sorting. Start by putting out all the pictures face-up and let children choose 
one that they feel confident in naming and sorting correctly. Ask them to name the picture 
and the letter by saying, “
 begins with the 
 sound and goes under 
the letter 
”. Another time, pass out the pictures and call on children to come 
up and sort the card they were given. Then turn the pictures face-down in a stack or 
spread them out on the floor and let children turn over the picture they will sort. Children 
enjoy the anticipation of not knowing which picture they will get.
• Plan plenty of time for individual practice. After group modelling and discussion, put sets of 
pictures in centres or create copies of picture sets for children to cut apart for more sort-
ing. Create sheets of pictures for sorting by copying pictures from this book, cutting them 
apart and pasting them in a mixed-up fashion on a template.
• Plan follow-up activities. Cut-and-paste, draw-and-label and word hunts through familiar chart 
stories, nursery rhymes or little books are helpful follow-up activities. They require children 
to recognise, or recall, the same beginning sounds and to judge whether they fit the category.
• Encourage pretend writing and invented spelling. In the process of inventing spellings, chil-
dren exercise their developing phonics knowledge in a meaningful activity (Clarke, 1988; 
NRP, 2000; Snow et al., 1998). To get children started, demonstrate how to use letters to 
represent sounds as you write with children during interactive writing (see the Morning 
Message described in Activity 4.38). Asking children to label their drawings or to write 
just a sentence about something is a good way to get writing started (see Figure 4.6).
Assessing and Monitoring Growth in Letter–Sound Knowledge.   
There are several ways to assess students’ abilities to match beginning consonant sounds to the 
appropriate letters. The first step is observing children to see how quickly and accurately they sort. 
Then monitor children’s daily writing efforts using invented spelling for ongoing and authentic 
assessment. The Emergent Class Record found on the PDToolkit helps you analyse children’s 
writing across the emergent stage. There is also a Beginning Consonant Sounds and Letters assess-
ment on the website that asks children to circle a picture that begins with a given letter. A simple 
five-word spelling assessment such as the Kindergarten Spelling Inventory (KSI), also found on 
the website, is particularly appropriate for late emergent spellers. You might also call out five of the 
words on the Primary Spelling Inventory described in Chapter 2.
Assess children formally at least three times a year, and informally all the time using daily 
writing. For children receiving additional instructional interventions, we recommend more 
frequent monitoring to gauge their progress (Invernizzi, 2009). Longitudinal research indi-
cates that kindergarten children should be aware that letters are associated with speech sounds 
and be able to provide at least four letter sounds in the fall of the year and at least 20 letter 
sounds in the spring (Invernizzi et al., 2005) in order to succeed without additional instruction 
or intervention. On average, kindergartners can accurately produce 14 letter sounds in the fall 
and nearly all of them in the spring (Invernizzi et al., 2014).
Concepts about Print (CAP)
Children are surrounded by print on signs, package labels, magazines, computers and 
­television, even on the clothes they wear; however, children need adults to talk about the 
purposes print serves and the special ways in which the visual forms of print are organised.

For example, when you print the words to “Where Is Thumbkin?” on chart paper and point 
to them as the children sing along, you are helping them understand concepts of print. It hap-
pens when you stop to point out the X in the exit sign and explain what it means. It happens 
when you show a book cover and remind children that they have heard other stories written 
and illustrated by Tomie dePaola. The key is to be conscious of the many ways we use print 
and to “think aloud” as we draw children’s attention to it in explicit ways. Justice and Ezell 
(2004) call this print referencing.
Print Referencing.  When you use a print referencing style during shared read-
alouds, such as naming and pointing out letters or asking questions about print and point-
ing to words as they read, children show growth on measures of concepts about print, letter 
recognition and name writing (Justice, Kaderavek, Fan, Sofka & Hunt, 2009). Reading with 
children during interactive or shared reading and writing with children during interactive 
writing and as you take dictations, provides abundant opportunities to develop concepts about 
print. Table 4.3 provides a list of the functions and forms of print and offers examples of print 
referencing that you might use.

for the author’s name?
Language related to phonological sensitivity—Syllable, sound,

Can this word be rug? What is the first sound in rug?
Punctuation and special print—Periods, question marks, 
exclamation marks, quotation marks, bold print, italics
Listen to how I read this sentence. It ends with an exclamation 
point so I want it to make it sound exciting.
Concept of word—Words are composed of a string of letters; 
words are separated by spaces
Watch while I point to the words in this sentence. 
We need to leave a space here before we write the next word.

Reference specific print forms and functions during tasks that encourage children to write 
their own names, such as sign-up procedures. When you incorporate print into dramatic play 
centres such as restaurants, doctors’ offices and so on, children use writing as they pretend 
to be waiters writing down a dinner order, doctors writing a prescription and the like. In the 
process, they learn that print takes many forms and serves many functions. You can find some 
specific activities (4.35 to 4.38) at the end of this chapter.
Assessing and Monitoring Growth in Cap.  Marie Clay (1985) first 
developed a formal protocol for assessing concepts about print using a series of questions 
while sharing a book with a child. Many variations of this exist; in fact, state and local stan-
dards for early literacy may include a checklist of questions regarding children’s development 
in CAP. You can also see concepts about print in children’s efforts to write their names. Their 
efforts, which may range from scribbles to letter-like forms mixed with numbers to recog-
nisable signatures, can predict later literacy achievement (Welsch, Sullivan & Justice, 2003). 
We provide several assessments on the PDToolkit that help you interpret name writing and 
other writing. There is also a Concepts about Print sort and a checklist to use as you share a 
book. Concepts about print can be informally assessed all the time as you read and write with 
children by posing questions such as “Who can point to a capital letter D?” or “What do we 
put at the end of a sentence?”
Concept of Word in Text (COW-T)
The ultimate concept about print is achieving a concept of word in text (COW-T)—the abil-
ity to fingerpoint or track accurately to printed words in text while reading from memory. 
Reaching this milestone depends on a student’s ability to isolate the beginning consonant 
sounds of spoken words and knowledge of letter–sound correspondences—skills that help the 
beginning reader find words on the page. Incorporating concept of word activities into daily 
literacy practice not only strengthens students’ speech-to-print matching, but it also solidifies 
their alphabet knowledge, emerging phonemic awareness and knowledge of words in print. 
Prior to achieving a concept of word in text, emergent children, as well as emergent adults, 
have great difficulty identifying individual phonemes within words (Morais, Cary, Alegria & 
Bertelson, 1979). There is an interaction between alphabetic knowledge, the ability to match 
speech to print and phonemic awareness (Flanigan, 2007; Morris et al., 2003; Tunmer, 1991). 
However, achieving a concept of word in text is not an all-or-nothing affair—there is a devel-
opmental continuum.
The concept of word continuum includes developing, rudimentary and firm levels. Dur-
ing the emergent stage, learners move from the developing level to a rudimentary concept 
of word. Children with a firm concept of word in text are letter name–alphabetic spellers, 
described in the next chapter. To determine where your children are on the concept of word 
continuum, examine the accuracy of their fingerpoint reading to memorised rhymes and 
jingles, their ease with identifying words in context and their ability to remember words in iso-
lation that were viewed previously in context (Blackwell-Bullock, Invernizzi, Drake & Howell, 
2009; Flanigan, 2007; Morris, 1993).
Developing Cow-T.  Children who are just developing a COW-T will have some ori-
entation to the page, moving from the top to the bottom and linearly side to side (but perhaps 
not from left to right). What they point to on the page as they recite does not coincide with 
printed word units at all. The pre-literate child may point in a rhythmic approximation of the 
memorised text with little attention to word boundaries.
Through your demonstrations, students’ fingerpointing behaviours change. Left-to-right 
movement becomes habitualised. As they note white spaces, children begin to track rhythmi-
cally across the text, pointing to words for each stressed beat. For example, when tracking the 
traditional five-word ditty, “Sam, Sam, the baker man”, they may point four times: Sam/Sam/
the-baker/man, as if keeping time on a drum. An article (the, a, an) may be treated as part of 
the noun that follows it.

Rudimentary Cow-T.  As children become aware that print has something to do with 
sound units such as syllables, their fingerpointing becomes more precise and changes from a 
gross rhythm to a closer match. This rudimentary COW-T works well for one-syllable words, 
but not so well for words of two or more syllables. When they track “Sam, Sam, the baker 
man”, they may now point six times: Sam/Sam/the/ba/ker/man. When they pronounce /ker/, 
the second syllable of baker, they point to the next word, man. Figure 4.10 illustrates the phe-
nomenon of getting off track on two-syllable words.
As children learn the alphabet and the sounds associated with the letters, beginning sounds 
anchor their fingerpointing more directly to the memorised recitation. They realise that when 
they say the word man, they need to have their finger on a word beginning with an m. If they 
do not, then they must start again. These self-corrections mark the transition to a full COW-T 
where children point accurately. Figure 4.11 shows the progression of fingerpointing accuracy 
in relation to writing development during the emergent to early letter name–alphabetic stage of 
word knowledge. Children with a rudimentary COW-T will begin to remember a few written 
words. This is a sign that these children are on their way to becoming the beginning readers or 
the early letter name–alphabetic spellers described in the next chapter.
Fingerpoint Reading and Tracking Words.  The best way for children 
to move from a developing to a rudimentary COW-T is to have them point to the words as 
they reread memorised text and to draw their attention to letters and sounds when they get off 
track. These texts might be picture captions, dictated experience stories, poems, songs, simple 
patterned books or excerpts from a favourite story printed on sentence strips or chart paper. 
Rhythmic texts are particularly appealing to use when children are developing a COW-T but 
may throw them off in their tracking. Eventually moving to less rhythmic, less predictable 
texts may be in order (Cathey, 1991). Once these texts become familiar, encourage children 
to read them from memory, pointing to each word as it they say it. In this way, children learn 
how to find the words on the page—an important prerequisite to acquiring a sight vocabulary.
Picture Captions.  One of the best ways to help children make connections between 
speech and print is to record what they say in a dictation and then to read it back. Picture 
captions are quick and easy forms of dictation.
• First, have the children draw a picture, such as their favourite toy or Halloween costume, 
and encourage them to include as much detail as possible.
Figure 4.10  Trying to Match Voice to Print

• While they are finishing their drawings, walk around and ask each 
child to tell something about his or her picture. Choose a simple 
phrase or sentence from the description and write it verbatim 
beneath the picture (see Figure 4.12). Say each word as you write it, 
drawing attention to the sounds and letters and involving the child 
when appropriate with questions such as, “What sound do you hear 
first?”
• Read the caption by pointing to each word. Ask the child to read 
along with you and then to read it alone while pointing. Later, the 
child may attempt to reread the caption to a buddy.
Like picture captions, spoken or dictated accounts of students’ 
experiences also help them link speech to print. This approach is tradi-
tionally referred to as the language experience approach (LEA), and 
is described in more detail beginning on page 141.

fingerpointing in a shared reading format. This activity meets many of 
the common core state standards (CCSS Foundational Skills 1, 1.a-d, 2, 3, 
3.a-c, 4).
It is important for children to first learn the rhyme, song or jingle “by 
heart”, because developing a COW-T is all about matching oral speech 
to print. It helps to use pictures for prompts, as shown in Figure 4.13. To 
teach your children to memorise the rhyme, point to each picture frame 
while singing or reciting the line that goes with it, repeating as needed. 
Some ­children may only be able to memorise two lines, whereas others can 
handle four or six. The Resource Connections box below has some printed 
resources for traditional rhymes and jingles. They can also be found by 
searching the Internet. Many nursery rhymes, songs and jump rope jingles 
are illustrated in Words Their Way®: Letter and Picture Sorts for Emergent Spell-
ers (Bear, Invernizzi, Johnston & Templeton, 2010).
Once children memorise the rhyme, introduce it on chart paper printed 
in text large enough for everyone to see. Model how to fingerpoint “read” 
and invite children to “read” with you chorally (in unison) or using echo 
reading (you read a line, then they read the same line again, fingerpointing). 
If you used a song, it is time to slow it down and read it at this point. After 
at least three passes (modelling, choral, echo), call on children to fingerpoint 
read independently, touching each word as they say it. After several rounds 
of fingerpoint reading, see whether children can identify one or two targeted 
words per line. Point to a word and ask, “What’s this word?” If a child doesn’t know the word, 
show him or her how to start at the beginning of the line to reread or voice point up to the 
word in question. Alternatively, you can ask children to find a word in a particular line by 
providing a beginning sound: “I’m thinking of a word in this line that starts just like the word 
ball. What word am I thinking of? Can you point to it? How did you know that was the word 
I was thinking of? Yes! Box and ball both begin with the /b/ sound. They both begin with the 
letter b!”
Later, give children their own copy of the rhyme on a single sheet of paper so that they 
can get more practice pointing to the words as they read chorally and individually. You might 
also give them sentence strips to cut apart and rebuild the text, or individual word cards to 
match to the same words in context. When children have their own copies of the rhyme, 
they can highlight or underline the words you ask them to find. Add words that children 
remember without having to voice point to their beginning sound sorts. A detailed whole-to-
part, five-day lesson plan for teaching a concept of word in text using memorable rhymes or 
jingles is described in Activity 4.39. Learners with limited English will benefit from practising 
fingerpointing using materials in their primary languages. Rhymes and jingles in Spanish can 
be found in Words Their Way®: Emergent Sorts for Spanish-Speaking English Learners (Helman,

Assessing and Monitoring Growth in Cow-T.  You can easily assess 
concept of word in text by asking children to point to individual words in a familiar piece of 
text, such as a nursery rhyme or jump rope jingle. “One, Two, Buckle My Shoe” or “Humpty 
Dumpty” work well because they have words of more than one syllable. Observe how chil-
dren point to words on the page, using the descriptors in Figure 4.11. After several rounds of 
fingerpoint reading, ask children to name the words that you point to in context or more ran-
domly, as described previously, and observe their strategies. Do they reread an entire line and 
count up the memorised words to identify it? Or do they identify it immediately? Ask, “How 
did you find that word?” or “How did you know that word?” Children who can tell you that a 
word starts with a w are using developing letter–sound knowledge to track words in text. This 
is a necessary precursor to acquiring sight words, which is discussed in the next chapter. The 
COW-T assessment at the PDToolkit uses “Humpty Dumpty” to monitor progress towards 
achieving a COW-T.
The Language Experience Approach (LEA)
The five components of emergent literacy development—vocabulary, language and concept 
development; phonological awareness; alphabet and letter–sound knowledge; concepts about 
print; and developing a COW-T—are all highly intercorrelated. One way to develop and 
integrate all of these components is through language-rich, hands-on experiences that engage 
students’ attention and help them connect these abstract, decontextualised school-acquired 
concepts to everyday life. Teachers can write down accounts of these experiences and use them 
to develop emergent word knowledge, meeting many of the Common Core State Standards 
for Kindergarten (CCSS Foundational Skills 1,1.a-d, 2, 2.d, 3.a-c, Language 1, 1.a, 1.f, 2, 
2.a-d).
The language experience approach (LEA) was developed by Stauffer (1980) and refined by 
Allen (1976) and others (Hall, 1980; Henderson, 1981; Nessel & Jones, 1981; Labbi, Eakle &  
Montero, 2002). LEA is based on the premise that what you say 
can be written and what you write can be read. The motivation 
and engagement that results from using students’ self-generated 
language has revitalised an interest in LEA, especially for emer-
gent learners and for children learning English as another lan-
guage (Dorr, 2006). Experience is the best teacher!
Field trips, cooking activities, playground events and class 
pets provide opportunities for shared experiences in which new 
vocabulary and the students’ own language abounds. Observa-
tions and comments can then be written next to each student’s 
name during a group dictation, as shown in Figure 4.14, or chil-
dren can dictate individual accounts. In an activity described by 
McCabe (1996) called “Tell a story to get a story”, the teacher 
tells a simple two-to-three-sentence story and then asks the 
children if they know a similar story: “Has anything like that 
happened to you?” Children tell their own stories, which the 
teacher records as dictations.
Students’ own language should be recorded as closely as 
possible so that they will be able to read it back. The child 
should approve any grammar corrections with prompts like, 
“Good idea, can we say it this way?” When the dictation is 
completed, it should be read and reread many times. With this 
format, attention to words and their boundaries can be high-
lighted in a meaningful context. For example, a child may be

asked to locate his or her own name in the group dictation or to find a word that starts with 
the same letter as his or her own name. Each child should get a personal copy of the dictation 
to practise fingerpointing while reading together chorally and from memory. These copies 
can be collected into a notebook called a personal reader (described in more detail in the next 
chapter). You can cut up a second copy of the dictation into sentence strips or individual words 
to match back to the original.
The steps for LEA whole-to-part teaching are as follows:
1.	 Plan a hands-on experience such as a simple science experiment or feeding a baby animal. 
Exchange thoughts and observations orally with the students. Introduce and use new 
vocabulary, then suggest writing down their ideas, calling on one child at a time.
2.	 Have the children dictate a narrative account of the experience and their observations 
while you record their statements on a chart—one statement per line for emergent learn-
ers. While writing, include print referencing. Shape the dictation into a coherent account 
as needed. For example, ask a child to hold an idea until later if it comes too early in a 
sequence of events.
3.	 Have children reread the dictated account several times chorally until it becomes very 
familiar. Then they get their own copy of the dictation to illustrate and practise voice 
pointing.
4.	 Use the dictation to develop concepts and vocabulary, alphabet knowledge, letter–sound 
correspondences, print concepts and a concept of word in print.
Children in the late emergent stage with a rudimentary COW-T can begin to select words to 
include in a word bank of known words. Word banks are described in the next chapter.
Word Study Routines and Management
The research in emergent literacy suggests that a comprehensive approach to instruction and 
early intervention is the most effective procedure (Pressley, 2006). A comprehensive approach 
includes attention to the six components of the emergent literacy “diet” described in this 
chapter. These essential components can be integrated into major organisational time units 
during which you Read To, Read With, Write With, do Word Study and Talk With (RRWWT) 
children. During read to time, you read aloud literature that offers exposure to new vocabulary 
and literary language. During read with time, children engage in shared reading and rereading 
of familiar texts. When you model how to write by stretching out the sounds in words and 
matching them to letters, you are writing with children, who will, in turn, write for themselves. 
Word study includes direct instruction in phonological awareness, the alphabet and letter 
sounds. Finally, a comprehensive program provides children with ample opportunities to talk 
with you and their peers about the books and experiences they have shared.
Combining these activities into a cohesive RRWWT routine is important so that the 
activities and materials flow together in a logical way and serve multiple purposes. Recall how 
Mrs. Smith introduced an engaging core book and used it to draw attention to letters and 
sounds, to highlight vocabulary, to offer children practice tracking familiar text and to sort 
pictures by rhyme and beginning sounds. Words Their Way®: Letter and Picture Sorts for Emer-
gent Spellers (Bear et al., 2010) offers examples of how these components can be integrated and 
provides prepared sorts as well as rhymes and jingles for reading.
Emergent Literacy Daily Management Plan
The daily management of emergent literacy instruction should include whole groups, small 
groups and literacy centres, as outlined in Table 4.4. For example, in the video of Mrs. Smith 
with a whole group you can see her model fingerpoint reading and other concepts about print 
for the whole group, and then call a small group to introduce a picture sort of initial sounds 

	
 Word Study for Learners in the Emergent Stage

that children later practised independently. Working from a whole text, then with sentences, 
words, letters and sounds, is known as the whole-to-part framework.
Whole-group activities emphasise reading to and with students, teacher modelling, lis-
tening and vocabulary development. Print referencing opportunities arise with whole-group 
instruction. Read-alouds serve many purposes and you can plan two or more whole-group 
sessions during the day for emergent children where they listen to read-alouds from a variety 
of genres, including information books related to thematic studies, alphabet books and books 
with language play such as rhyme. Use whole-group time to sing songs while pointing to 
the words, practise the alphabet song, model writing and introduce shared reading activities 
designed to facilitate CAP and COW-T. This is where the “whole” of a whole-to-part model 
takes place, with some attention to the parts.
Children can participate actively under close supervision while in small groups or during 
circle time. This is when to implement differentiated instruction according to assessed needs. 
You can form small groups initially based on alphabet knowledge and phonological awareness 
but also on concept of word (developing vs. rudimentary). For example, some children will 
need to focus on alphabet recognition and look for letters in familiar texts, whereas children 
who already know their letters and have a rudimentary COW-T may be ready to acquire some 
sight words from repeated readings of familiar text. The small group is where the “parts” of 
the whole-to-part lesson format are addressed in depth, such as rhyming picture sorts or pic-
ture sorts for beginning sounds.
Independent work provides additional practice. Once children are introduced to activi-
ties and sorts in small groups, they can work independently, with partners, in centres or at 
their seats. Betty Lee’s word study routines described in Chapter 3 are designed for inde-
pendent work. Games and puzzles, such as described in the activities section in this chapter, 
should be first introduced and modelled in groups and then placed in centres. Writing can 
be an independent activity as children work in journals or draw and label pictures based on 
sorts.

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
This section provides specific activities arranged by the six components of early literacy. 
Within each, the activities are roughly in order of increasing difficulty. However, concept 
sorts do not have to precede sound awareness, which in turn must precede alphabet. In real-
ity, these develop simultaneously and constitute the “literacy diet” during the emergent years, 
with many activities that cut across the categories. Some of the games are generic to all stages 
of developmental word knowledge as indicated by the Adaptable for Other Stages symbol 
used throughout the book. Common Core State Standards for Kindergarten are listed with 
each activity.
Oral Language, Concepts and Vocabulary
Activities include read-alouds, retellings and concept sorts.
	 4.1	 Using Interactive Read-Alouds to Develop Vocabulary
Books provide the best exposure to new vocabulary for young children, but simply reading to 
them is not enough. You need to draw attention to words and plan ways to ensure that new 
words are acquired and used. (CCSS Language 1.d, 1.f, 4, 4.a, 5, 5.c, 5.d, 6)

	
 Word Study for Learners in the Emergent Stage	
145
activities | EMERGENT STAGE
Procedures
1.	Select a book with rich language that is age-appropriate for your listeners. Preview the 
book, looking for new vocabulary and conceptual understandings that will extend stu-
dents’ background knowledge. For example, rural or small-town children might not be 
familiar with the escalator mentioned in Corduroy by Don Freeman. Select three to five 
words based on (1) utility, (2) concreteness, (3) repetition and (4) relatedness to themes 
or topics of study. Prepare child-friendly definitions. (You might occasionally model using 
a picture dictionary, and even use it yourself to develop definitions, but dictionaries often 
do not provide clear examples or explanations.)
2.	Introduce the book by reading the title and naming the author and illustrator. Look at the 
cover and at least the first few pages to elicit a prediction (“What do you think this book 
will be about?”) and to set a purpose for reading. Build background knowledge as needed 
and try to introduce the target words conversationally, perhaps pointing to a picture or 
supplying a brief definition. Ask the children to listen for the words as you read.
3.	Make the read-aloud interactive by inviting comments and questions from the children 
during reading. Encourage them to connect with the characters and theme (“Have you 
ever worn overalls like Corduroy’s?”). Expand on children’s brief utterances (“lost but-
ton”) with complete sentences to model more complex language (“Yes, Corduroy had 
lost a button but he did not realise it”.). Point out the targeted words when they occur in 
context and have children say the words with you.
4.	After reading, invite children to respond to the story in personal ways and then revisit the 
targeted words as you model their use, pose questions and elicit children’s responses. Use 
the new words in questions about the story and ask children to use them in sentences, act 
them out, or find other applications for them to engage the children. (“Why do you think 
Corduroy admired the furniture in the store?” “What is something that you admire?” 
“Turn to your partner and use the word admire in a sentence”.)
	 4.2	 PEER—Retellings through Dialogic Reading
In this activity, described as “dialogic reading” (Whitehurst et al., 1994), children learn how to 
talk about and retell a storybook. With your guidance and prompting they talk about a familiar 
book. Gradually give the children more responsibility for retelling the story until they can 
do so with little or no assistance. Parents can be trained in this technique and you can send 
books home that have been read and discussed in school. Adults can use the PEER sequence 
(Morgan & Meier, 2008) to stimulate oral language and help the child become the storyteller. 
(CCSS Language 1, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 6)
Procedures  Begin by reading a book aloud and then follow up with small-group or 
individual rereadings before engaging in a prompted discussion. Repeat the prompt sequence 
several times using the PEER guidelines:
P Prompt the child to say something about the book using open-ended questions. (Point 
to a picture of a mouse and say, “What is he doing?” The child says, “Running”.)
E Evaluate the child’s response. (“That’s right!”)
E Expand the response by rephrasing or adding information to it. (“The mouse is running 
away from the cat”.)
R Repeat the prompt and ask the child to expand on it. (“What is the mouse doing?” The 
child says, “He is running away from the cat”.)
Use additional prompts such as the following to stimulate talk:
1.	Ask what, when, where, why and how questions.
2.	Leave a blank at the end of a sentence for the children to fill in.
3.	Ask children to retell what has happened so far or to retell the ending.
4.	Ask children to describe what they see happening in pictures.
5.	Ask children to make connections with their own experiences.

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
	 4.3	 Turn and Talk
A good way to increase the opportunities for oral interaction and vocabulary use in your class-
room is to ask children to turn and talk to an assigned partner during a discussion. Rather than 
calling on one child, everyone has a chance to respond to a question, to share an experience, to 
make a prediction, to summarise and so on. Turn and talk is a good way to encourage children 
who might be reluctant to speak in front of the whole group. This includes English learners 
as well as shy or less verbal students. (CCSS Language 1.d, 1.f, 5.c, 6)
Procedures
1.	Model your expectations for “turn and talk” with another adult. Demonstrate how both 
partners need a chance to speak and suggest ways to encourage a reluctant talker. (“Tell 
me what you think. It’s your turn now” or “You go first this time”.) You can also ask two 
children who do a particularly good job together to model for the rest of the group. Chil-
dren should not move about during turn and talk but instead turn “knee to knee and eye 
to eye” and talk softly so they do not disturb others.
2.	Select partners before the read-aloud or other shared experience begins. You may 
allow children to pick their own partners on the way to the group and then sit down 
together. Or you may select partners, taking into consideration children’s language 
competence and confidence. A more verbal child may provide a model for a less ver-
bal child, but he or she might also dominate the conversation, so watch to see how 
pairs work out and be ready to intervene with suggestions about ways to give the less 
verbal child an equal opportunity. Use the same partners for a week or longer to save 
organisational time.
3.	Bring turn and talk time to a close by offering a countdown warning. One way to do this 
is to silently hold up five fingers and then lower each finger in turn. As children notice, 
they should imitate you down to the final fist when everyone should be done talking. How 
much time you allow will vary, but bring turn and talk time to a close before children lose 
their focus and get off the assigned topic.
4.	As partners talk to each other, listen in to monitor their conversations. When the group 
is back together you might call on one or two children to report what they talked about. 
Because less verbal or shy children have had a chance to rehearse their ideas, they should 
be better able to speak before a larger group after turn and talk time.
	 4.4	 Paste the Pasta and Other Concrete Concept Sorts
Categorising pasta by size, shape and colour is a good hands-on activity that introduces the 
idea of sorting to young children. Many early childhood curricula include the study of pat-
tern, but being able to categorise by particular attributes must come first. 
It is difficult for young children to stay focussed on a single attribute of 
interest. They may begin sorting by colour and then switch to shape in 
midstream. They will need many activities of this kind, sorting real, con-
crete objects that have different features. (CCSS Language 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 
5.a, 5.b, 5.c, 5.d, 6)
Materials  You need three to six types of pasta of various sizes and 
shapes. You may wish to use pasta of various colours or you can dye your 
own by shaking the pasta in a jar with a tablespoon of alcohol and a few 
drops of food colouring, then lay it out on newspaper to dry. If you dye 
your own, make sure that any one colour encompasses a variety of shapes 
and sizes. Two or three colours are enough. Children can sort onto paper 
divided into columns, as shown in Figure 4.15, or simply into piles.
Procedures
1.	Prepare a mixture of the dried pasta and give each child a handful 
and a sorting paper.
Figure 4.15  Paste the Pasta

	
 Word Study for Learners in the Emergent Stage

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
2.	Begin with an open sort, in which you invite the children to come up with their own 
way of grouping. This gives you an opportunity to evaluate which children understand 
attribute sorting and which need more guidance. Ask the children to share their ideas 
and show their groups. Discuss the different features or attributes by which they can 
sort.
3.	Ask children to re-sort using a category different from their first one. You might end this 
activity by letting the children glue the pasta onto their sorting sheets by categories and 
then labelling their chosen sorts.
Variations  There is no end to the concrete things you can sort with your children as 
you explore the different features that define your categories, as in the following suggestions.
Children—male/female, hair colour, eye colour, age, favourite colour
Shoes—sandals/sneakers, right/left, tie/Velcro/buckle/slip-on
Clothing—mittens/gloves, types of headwear, short-sleeved tops/long-sleeved tops, coats 
with or without hoods, coats that button or zip
Buttons—two holes/four holes/no holes, shape, colour, size
Bottle caps—size, colour, plastic/metal, plain/printed, ribbed/smooth
Blocks—shape, colour, size, length
Toys—size, colour, purpose, plastic/wood/metal
Food—sweet/sour/bitter/salty, fruits/vegetables/grains, healthy/not healthy
	 4.5	 Concept Books and Concept Sorts
Simple concept books designed for young children make great beginnings for concept sorts. 
Examples include Is It Red? Is It Yellow? Is It Blue? and other books by Tana Hoban, and 
My Very First Book of Shapes by Eric Carle. Topics include shapes, colours, textures, positions, 
types of clothing, animals, opposites and so on. (CCSS Language 1, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 5.a, 5.b, 
5.c, 5.d, 6)
Procedures
1.	Because concept books have little text, engage children in discussing what they see and 
supplying appropriate labels. “This is a book about colours. Here is a picture of a toy 
dump truck. What colour is the dump truck? Yes, the dump truck is red. Now it’s your 
turn. Tell me what you see here”.
2.	Collect objects or pictures of objects that can be used for sorting. In the case of colours, 
you can probably find real objects around the room such as books, markers, toys and so 
on. Explain to the children that they are going to help you sort the objects by colour. Use 
complete sentences to model: “Here is a red ball. I will put the ball with the other things 
that are red”. After sorting, help children make generalisations such as “How are all these 
things alike? Yes, all the things in this category are red”.
3.	Make labels for each category of your sort with help from the students: “I am going to 
write red on this card to label this category. Listen, rrrr-ed. What letter do I need to write 
down first?”
4.	Put sorts where children can use them on their own and encourage them to talk as they 
sort. Children can look for more pictures in magazines or catalogues that fit the categories 
or they can draw pictures, cut them out and paste them into categories. Encourage them 
to label their own sorts with invented spellings.
Variations  You can develop other concept sorts along the same lines. The following list 
of categories represents opposites or antonyms that are frequently confused by young children 
and can be better understood through sorting.
• Real/imaginary
• Smooth/rough
• Big/little
• Hard/soft

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
Of course, any book can be the starting point for a concept sort. In the next chapter, we 
describe a food sort based on Gregory the Terrible Eater by Marjorie Sharmat.
	 4.6	 All My Friends Photograph Sort
Another example of an open-ended sort involves guessing each other’s categories. (CCSS 
­Language 1.b, 1.d, 1.f, 5, 5.a, 5.b, 6)
Materials  Take digital pictures of your students and create a composite so that they are 
all on one page. Each small group gets a set of pictures to cut apart and sort. The children also 
need a sheet of construction paper to divide into columns for sorting.
Procedures  Brainstorm with the children some of the ways that the pictures might 
be grouped (hair length, hair colour, clothing, boys/girls, facial expressions). Have children 
work in groups to sort by these or other categories they discover. After pasting their pictures 
into the columns on their paper, each group can hold up their effort and ask the others in 
the class to guess their categories. The category labels or key words should then be written 
on the papers.
Variations  Children can sort photographs from home according to places (inside/­
outside, home/vacation), number of people in the photograph (adults, sisters, brothers), 
­number of animals in the photograph, seasons (by clothing, outside trees/plants), age of people 
in the photograph and so forth. As children learn to recognise their classmates’ names, have 
them match the names to the pictures.
	 4.7	 Transportation Unit
Teachers of young children often organise their curriculum into thematic units of study. Such 
units frequently lend themselves to concept sorts, which review and extend the understand-
ings central to the unit goals. The following example uses a transportation theme. (CCSS 
Language 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 5.a, 5.b, 5.c, 5.d, 6)
Materials  You need a collection of toy vehicles (planes, boats, cars and trucks) or 
­pictures of vehicles (a prepared picture sort is on the PDToolkit website). Books featuring 
transportation, such as My Truck Is Stuck by Kevin Lewis, can introduce the sort.
Procedures
1.	Lay out the pictures on the floor or table and invite the 
children to think of which ones might go together. Encour-
age them to think up a variety of possibilities that will divide 
everything into only two or three categories. This is an open 
sort because the children are providing the categories.
2.	After each suggestion, sort the vehicles by the identified 
attributes, talking about the categories and how things are 
sorted: “A truck has wheels so I will put it with the car and 
the bicycle”. Record the ideas for different sorts on a chart or 
chalkboard. Some possibilities include plastic/metal, big/little, 
old/new, one colour/many colours, windows/no windows, 
wheels/no wheels and land/air/water.
3.	After exploring this open sort thoroughly, have the children 
select the category they like the best. They can then be given 
construction paper to label their categories and draw or cut 
out pictures for each. As always, encourage them to label the 
pictures and the categories with invented spelling, as shown 
in Figure 4.16.

 Word Study for Learners in the Emergent Stage

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
Phonological Awareness (PA)
Phonological awareness consists of an array of understandings about speech sounds that 
includes a sensitivity to syllables, rhyme, alliteration and phonemes. Syllables, rhyme and 
alliteration are the best places to start with emergent learners and many activities for develop-
ing these are included here. The Morning Message (Activity 4.38) and Start with Children’s 
Names (Activity 4.23) also include phonological awareness instruction in the context of read-
ing and writing.
	 4.8	 Two for One! Long Words, Short Words
Emergent learners have difficulty separating the sound structure of a spoken word from its 
meaning. One way to sensitise children to the phonological aspects of words is to build com-
pound words. The following activity focusses on the concept that some words are long and 
some are short, and the difference between long and short words has nothing to do with the 
size of the referent. (CCSS Foundational Skills 2)
Materials  Consult the list of compound words in Appendix E. Pick concrete, two-
syllable compound words that you can easily illustrate. The words bedroom, blackbird, cowboy, 
doorbell, fingernail, fireman, football, doghouse, lipstick, mailman, pancake, raincoat, sandbox, snow-
man and snowball are good choices for starters. Pictures for many of the words can be found 
in Appendix C.
Procedures
1.	Take a picture of snow and another picture of a man. After discussing the meaning of each 
word separately, place the two pictures side by side and ask children to say each word in 
succession: “snow-man”. Talk about how the one word, snowman, is made of two words, 
snow plus man.
2.	Replace the two separate pictures of snow and a man with one picture of a snowman and 
discuss again how the word snowman is made up of two words: snow and man. However, 
because a snowman might not be “as big” as a real man, it is necessary to take this exercise 
one step further to develop the idea of word size in terms of sound as opposed to meaning.
3.	Hold up the picture of snow and ask children to clap as they say the word snow. Next, hold 
up the picture of the man and ask the children to clap as they say the word man. Finally, 
hold up the picture of the snowman and ask the children to clap for each word in snowman.
4.	Discuss how the word snowman is longer than either the word snow or the word man 
because snowman has two claps, whereas snow and man have only one! Snowman has more 
claps, so it is a longer word.
Variations  Hold up the printed word snow and compare it to the printed word snow-
man. Count the letters and talk about which word has more letters. Say, “I’m going to say two 
short words and you tell me what long word those two short words make. Ready? Bed (pause) 
room. What longer word do those two smaller words make? Yes, they make the word bedroom! 
Let’s clap out the syllables in bedroom (clap, clap). Ready for another one?” Repeat with other 
concrete words.
	 4.9	 Whose Name Is Longer? Let’s Clap to Find Out!
Once children develop sensitivity to syllables through clapping out compound words, move 
on to clapping out the syllables in everyone’s names. Tie this in with Activity 4.23 (Start with 
Children’s Names). (CCSS Foundational Skills 2, 2.b)
Procedures  Choose two children whose first names differ in the number of syllables. 
Say each name and have your children clap to each syllable as they pronounce it. “Whose 

	 150	
CH AP TER 4
activities | EMERGENT STAGE
name is longer? Which name has more claps? Shamika has three claps; Charles has only one”. 
Go around the classroom clapping out the syllables in everyone’s name. Have children move 
into groups by the number of claps in their names.
	4.10	 Rhyme in Children’s Books
Filling children’s heads with rhyme is one of the easiest and most natural ways to focus their 
attention on the sounds of the English language. Books written with rhyme provide one way 
to do this. As you read and reread these books aloud, pause to allow the children to guess the 
rhyming word. I Can’t, Said the Ant is an old favourite that invites child participation, with each 
line cued by an illustration. (CCSS Foundational Skills 2.a, Language 6) 
Here are some more of our favourites:
• Bluemie, E. (2012). How do you wokka-wokka? Somerville, MA: Candlewick.

	4.11	 Match and Sort Rhyming Pictures
After reading rhyming books aloud, follow up with an activity in which the children sort or 
match rhyming pictures. (CCSS Foundational Skills 2)
Materials  Three rhyming picture sorts are ready to print from the PDToolkit website. 
Appendix C in this book contains pictures grouped by initial sounds and by vowels. These can 
be copied, coloured lightly and glued to cards to make sets for sorting. The lists on pages 357 
and 334 will help you find rhyming sets. You can create sets of matching pairs or sets of three 
or more pictures that can be sorted by rhyme.
Procedures  Display a set of pictures and model how to sort them by rhyme. Say 
something like, “Let’s look for rhyming words. Boat rhymes with coat, so I will put it with 
the picture of the coat. Can you find two pictures that rhyme?” To make it easier for begin-
ners, put out three pictures at a time: two pictures that rhyme and one that does not. Name 
the pictures and ask children to find the two that rhyme: “Listen. Boat, train, coat. Which 
pictures rhyme?” After sorting pictures as a group, put the pictures in a centre for child to 
match on their own or create a rhyming sort handout so that each child can have his or her 
own sort.

	4.12	 Rhyming Books as a Starting Point to Invent Rhymes
Making up your own rhymes is quite an accomplishment and is likely to come after the 
ability to identify rhymes. Younger children need support to create rhymes, and a good 
place to start is pure nonsense. Jan Slepian and Ann Seidler’s The Hungry Thing (2001) 
tells of a creature who comes to town begging for food but has trouble pronouncing what 
he wants; shmancakes (pancakes), feetloaf (meatloaf) and hookies (cookies) are among his 
requests. Only a small boy can figure out what he wants. (CCSS Foundational Skills 2, 
Language 6)
Procedures  After reading the book, children can act it out. As each takes the part of 
the Hungry Thing, they must come up with a rhyming word for the food they want, such as 
moughnut, bandwich or smello. The story continues in The Hungry Thing Returns.
Variations  No one was a greater master of nonsense than Dr Seuss. There’s a Wocket 
in My Pocket (1974) takes readers on a tour of a young boy’s home in which all kinds of odd 
creatures have taken up residence. There is a woset in his closet, a zlock behind the clock and a 
nink in the sink. After reading this to a group, ask children to imagine what animal would live 
in their cubby, under the rug or in the lunchroom. Their efforts should rhyme, to be sure, but 
anything will do: a rubby, snubby or frubby might all live in a cubby.
	4.13	 Making Up Rhymes
Children who need more explicit instruction in rhyme will benefit from making up rhymes. 
(CCSS Foundational Skills 2a)
Materials  Pictures of rhyming objects such as rose, nose, hose and toes (see the list of 
rhyming pictures at the beginning of Appendix C).
Procedures
1.	Introduce a rhyming element. Ask your children to say ose. Explain that you are going 
to make words that have ose in them. Hold up a picture of a rose and ask children to say 
the word rose and listen for the ose at the end. Emphasise the rhyme in a whole word. Say 
rrr-ooose, emphasising the ose.
2.	Hold up a picture of a nose. Ask your children to tell you what it is. Tell them that n-ose has 
ose in it. Hold up other pictures (hose and toes) and ask if they can hear the ose at the end.
3.	Ask children if they can tell what sound is the same in rose, nose, hose and toes. Emphasise 
the ose at the end of each word makes them rhyme.
4.	Ask children to brainstorm other words that rhyme with rose: goes, chose and blows, for 
example. Make other rhymes in a similar fashion.
	4.14	 Use Songs to Develop a Sense of Rhyme and Alliteration
Earlier, we mentioned how appropriate works by the singer/songwriter Raffi are for young 
students. Teaching these songs by Raffi, some of which are available in books, can lead to 
inventive fun with rhymes and sounds. (CCSS Foundational Skills 2, Language 6)
“Apples and Bananas” (from One Light, One Sun)
“Spider on the Floor” (from Singable Songs for the Very Young)
“Down by the Bay” (also available from Singable Songs for the Very Young)
Another song that features names, rhyme and alliteration is “The Name Game”, originally 
sung by Shirley Ellis. It has apparently passed into the oral tradition of many neighbourhoods 
and may be known by some children in your class. Sing the song over and over, substituting 
the name of a different child on every round, as in the following two examples:
Sam Sam Bo Bam, Banana Fanna Bo Fam, Fee Fi Mo Mam, Sam!
Kaitlyn Kaitlyn Bo Baitlyn, Banana Fanna Bo Faitlyn, Fee Fi Mo Maitlyn, Kaitlyn!

	 152	
CH AP TER 4
activities | EMERGENT STAGE
Encourage children to share with you any playground songs and chants they might 
already know. Generations of children have made up variations of “Miss Mary Mack” and a 
new generation with a taste for rap is creating a whole new repertoire. You can take an active 
role in teaching these jingles to your students—or letting them teach you! Write them down 
to become reading material.
	4.15	 Rhyming Bingo
You can adapt bingo to many features. (CCSS Foundational Skills 2)
Materials  Prepare enough Bingo game boards for the number of children who will 
participate (small groups of three to five children are ideal). An appropriate game board size 
for young children is a 3-by-3 array; for older students, the game board can be expanded to 
a 4-by-4 or 5-by-5 array. Copy sets of pictures from Appendix C and form rhyming groups 
such as those listed on pages 357 and 358. Paste all but one of each rhyming group in the 
spaces on the game boards and then laminate them for durability. Each game board must be 
arranged differently.
Prepare a complementary set of cards on which you paste the remaining picture from 
each rhyming group. These will become the deck from which rhyming words are called aloud 
during the game. You will need some kind of marker to cover the squares on the game board. 
These may be as simple as two-inch squares of construction paper, plastic chips, bottle caps 
or pennies.
Procedures
1.	Give each child a game board and markers to cover spaces.
2.	You, or a designated child, act as the caller, who turns over cards from the deck and calls 
out the name of the picture.
3.	Each child searches the game board for a picture that rhymes with the one that has been 
called out. Children cover a match with a marker to claim the space.
4.	The winner is the first child to cover a row in any direction or the first child to fill his or 
her entire board.
	4.16	 Rhyming Concentration
This game for two or three children is played like traditional Concentration or the more cur-
rent Memory game. (CCSS Foundational Skills 2)
Materials  Assemble a collection of six to ten rhyming pairs from the pictures in Appen-
dix C. Paste the pictures on cards and laminate for durability. Be sure the pictures do not show 
through from the backside.
Procedures  Shuffle the pictures and then lay them face-down in rows. Children take 
turns flipping over two pictures at a time. If the two pictures rhyme, the child keeps the cards 
to hold to the end of the game. A child who makes a match gets another turn. The winner is 
the child who has the most matches at the end of the game.
Variations  This can be adapted to use with beginning sounds. Put letters on one set of 
cards and paste a picture of something that begins with that letter on another.
	4.17	 Pamela Pig Likes Pencils: Beginning Sounds  
and Alliteration
Sensitivity to beginning consonant sounds is essential for children to move out of the emer-
gent phase and begin to learn to read, and alliteration is a good way to get started. (Alliteration 
is the occurrence of two or more words having the same beginning sound.) The following 
activity helps children focus their attention on beginning consonant sounds in sequences of

spoken words. You might introduce this by reading A My Name Is Alice, by Jane Bayer and 
illustrated by Steven Kellogg. (CCSS Foundational Skills 2)
Materials  You will need a variety of animal puppets that can be named with matching 
beginning consonant sounds, such as Bob Bear, Donald Dog, Cass Cat or Pamela Pig. Try 
to pick names and animals beginning with just one single consonant sound—not a blend or 
consonant digraph. Although Charles starts with the letter C, it doesn’t start with the initial c 
sound (/s/ or /k/); it sounds with a /ch/ sound instead. You want both the name and the animal 
to have the same beginning sound. Puppets may be store-bought, but they can also be simple 
pictures of an animal like a bear or a cat cut out and fastened to the end of a stick to hold up.
Procedures
1.	Hold up your puppet and introduce it. Emphasise the beginning consonant sound as you 
introduce the name and the animal name. Say something like, “This is Pamela. She is a 
pig named Pamela. We call her Pamela Pig”.
2.	Explain that Pamela Pig like things that start with the same sound as her name, /p/. So 
Pamela likes pencils because pencils start with the /p/ sound just like Pamela and pig.
3.	Display various pictures (see Appendix C) or objects, some of which start with a /p/ sound 
( pen, paper, paint, pan, pin, pear) and some of which don’t. Pick two at a time (one that starts 
with a /p/ sound and one that doesn’t) and ask, “Which one would Pamela Pig pick?”
Variation  Have children brainstorm other things that Pamela Pig would like. They may 
volunteer such things as parties, plays or parks. Have children jump rope to the familiar jump 
rope jingle that plays on alliteration: “Chant (initial sound) my name is (child’s name) and my 
friend’s name is (name). We live in (place) and we sell (item)”.
	4.18	 It’s in the Bag—A Phoneme Blending Game
Materials  You will need a paper bag (gift bags are attractive) and an assortment of small 
objects collected from around the classroom, from outside or from home: chalk, pen, paper 
clip, tack, key, rock, stick and so on. You might use a puppet to add interest. (CCSS Founda-
tional Skills 2, 2.c, 2.d)
Procedures  Lay out a dozen or so objects and name them with the students, explaining 
that you will use them to play a game, and then introduce the puppet. The puppet will name 
an object in the bag, saying it very slowly (by syllables: pa-per-clip, or phonemes: rrr-oooo-ck), 
and the children will guess what it is saying. Let children take turns using the puppet to prac-
tise saying words slowly.
Variations  Use objects or pictures related to a topic of study. For example, if you are 
teaching a unit on animals, you could put toy animals or pictures of farm animals in the bag. 
This can be a sensory activity by letting children reach into the bag, figure out an object by 
touch and then say it slowly for the other children to guess. Objects that begin with the same 
beginning sounds can also be put into the bag to sort.
	4.19	 Incorporate Phonological Skills into Daily Activities
Teachers of emergent children can incorporate sound play into many daily activities and rou-
tines. (CCSS Foundational Skills 2, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 2.d)
1.	Lining up, taking attendance or calling children to a group: Call each student’s name and 
then lead the class in clapping the syllables in the name. Announce that everyone whose 
name has two syllables can line up, then one syllable, three and so on. Say each student’s 
name slowly as it is called. Make up a rhyme for each child’s name that starts with a sound 
of interest: Billy Willy, Mary Wary, Shanee Wanee and so on. Substitute the first letter in 
everyone’s name with the same letter: Will, Wary, Wanee, Wustin and so on.

	 154	
CH AP TER 4
activities | EMERGENT STAGE
2.	During read-alouds: Pause to let children fill in a rhyming word, especially on a second 
or third reading. If they have trouble, say the first sound for them with a clue: “It rhymes 
with cat and starts with m”. Draw attention to a long word by repeating it and clapping the 
syllables: “That’s a big word! Let’s clap the syllables: hip-po-pot-a-mus, five syllables!” You 
can also pause while reading and say a key word very slowly before asking the children to 
repeat it fast: “The next day his dad picked him up in a red… jeeeep. What’s that? A jeep, 
right”. Point to the letters as you do this.
Alphabet Knowledge
The following activities are designed to develop all aspects of alphabet knowledge, ­including 
letter recognition (both uppercase and lowercase), letter naming, letter writing and letter 
sounds. You may notice that these activities address more than one letter at a time: In kin-
dergarten, one letter per week is much too slow a pace and it does not address the needs of 
children who come to school already knowing their letters.
	4.20	 The Alphabet Song and Tracking Activities
Every early childhood classroom should have an alphabet strip or chart at eye level. Too often 
these strips are put up out of the children’s reach. The best locations for the strips are desktops 
or tabletops for easy reference. Use the following activities to make active use of these charts. 
(CCSS Foundational Skills 1.a,1.d)
Materials  Use commercial or teacher-made alphabet strips for both wall display and 
for individual students.
Procedures
1.	Learn the ABC song to the tune of “Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star”. Sing it many times.
2.	Model, pointing to each letter as the song is sung or the letters are chanted. Then ask the 
children to fingerpoint to the letters as they sing or chant.
3.	Play “find the letter” by naming a letter for children to touch on their strip. Ask them to 
name the letter that comes before or after the target letter.
4.	When children know about half of the alphabet, they can work on putting a set of 
letter cards, tiles or linking letters in alphabetical order. Use uppercase or lowercase 
letters, or pair the two (see Figure 4.17). Keep an ABC strip or chart nearby as a ready 
reference.

	4.21	 Share Alphabet Books
Share alphabet books with a group as you would other good literature and plan follow-up 
activities when appropriate. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d, 2, 3.a)
Materials  Some books are suitable for toddlers and merely require naming a letter and 
a single accompanying picture, such as Eric Carle’s ABC (2007). Others, such as Graeme Base’s 
Animalia, will keep even upper elementary children engaged as they try to name all the items 
that are hidden in the illustrations. Look for alphabet books such as the ones listed here to 
draw attention to beginning sounds through alliteration.

Many ABC books can be incorporated into thematic units, such as Jerry Pallotta’s ABC 
books featuring insects and animals, or Mary Azarian’s A Farmer’s Alphabet. Some alphabet 
books present special puzzles, such as Jan Garten’s The Alphabet Tale. Invite children to predict 
the upcoming animal by showing just the tip of its tail on the preceding page. Following is a

Procedures
1.	Discuss the pattern of the books, solve the puzzle and talk about the words that begin with 
each letter as you go through the books a second time.
2.	Focus on alliteration by repeating tongue twisters and creating a list of words for a par-
ticular letter. Brainstorm other words that begin with that letter and write them under the 
letter on chart paper or an interactive whiteboard.
3.	Make individual or class alphabet books. You can pick a theme or pattern for the book. 
Refer to the alphabet books you have read for ideas. One idea is a noun–verb format; for 
example, ants attack, bees buzz, cats catch and dogs doze.
4.	Look up a particular letter you are studying in several alphabet books or a picture diction-
ary to find other things that begin with that sound. This is an excellent introduction to 
using resource books.

	4.22	 Chicka Chicka Boom Boom Sort
Martin and Archambault’s Chicka Chicka Boom Boom (1989) 
is a great favourite and provides a wonderful way to move 
from children’s books to alphabet recognition. Letters can 
be sorted by capitals and lowercase and by beginning sounds 
(see Figure 4.18). Some teachers create a large coconut tree 
on the side of a metal filing cabinet so that children can 
act out the story and match uppercase and lowercase forms 
using magnetic letters. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d, 2)
 4.23	 Start with Children’s Names
Names are an ideal point from which to begin studying 
alphabet letters because children are naturally interested in 
their own names and their friends’ names. We like the idea 
of a “name of the day” (Cunningham, 2009) better than a 
“letter of the week”, because more letters are covered in less time. (CCSS Foundational Skills 
1, 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 2, 2.b, 2.e)
Materials  Prepare a card for each child on which his or her name is written in neatly 
executed block letters. Put all the names in a box or gift bag. Have additional blank cards ready 
to be cut apart as described. A pocket chart is handy for displaying the letters.
Procedures
1.	Each day, with great fanfare, draw a name—it becomes the name of the day. Begin with 
an open-ended question: “What do you notice about this name?” Children will respond 
in all sorts of ways depending on what they know about letters: “It’s a short name”. “It has 
three letters”. “It starts like Taneesh’s name”. “It has an o in the middle.”
2.	Next, children chant or echo the letters in the name as you point to each one. A cheer, 
led by you, is lots of fun:
Teacher: “Give me a T”.	
Children: “T”
Teacher: “Give me an O”.	
Children: “O”
Teacher: “Give me an M”.	
Children: “M”
Teacher: “What have we got?”	
Children: “Tom!”
3.	On another card, write the student’s name as the children recite the letters again. 
Then cut the letters apart and hand out the letters to children in the group. Chal-
lenge the children to put the letters back in order to spell the name correctly in a 
pocket chart or on a chalkboard ledge. After several repetitions, put the cut-up letters 
into an envelope with the child’s name and picture on the outside. Add the envelope 
to the name puzzle collection. Children love to pull out their friends’ names to put 
together.
4.	All of the children in the group should attempt to write the featured name on individual 
whiteboards, chalkboards or pieces of paper. This is an opportunity to offer some hand-
writing instruction, as you model for the students. Discuss the details of direction and 
movement of letter formation as the children imitate your motions.
5.	Each day, add the featured name to a display of all the names that have come before. 
Compare the names with sorting activities:
• Sort the names by the number of letters or syllables.
• Sort the names that share particular letters; for example, find all the names with an e in 
them.
• Sort the names that belong to boys and girls.
• Sort the names by alphabetical order.

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
Variations  Create a permanent display of the 
names and encourage children to practise writing 
their own and their friends’ names. If you have a 
writing centre, you might put all the names on index 
cards in a box for reference. Encourage children to 
reproduce names not only by copying the names 
with pencils, chalk and markers, but also with rubber 
stamps, foam cutout letters, link letters or letter tiles. 
The names display is an important reference tool dur-
ing writing time.
	4.24	 One Child’s Name
Learning the letters in one name is a good starting 
point for children in the early emergent stage. Use 
the following approach: Spell out a child’s name with 
letter cards, tiles, foam or plastic letters using both 
uppercase and lowercase. Spell it with uppercase 
­letters in the first row and ask the child to match low-
ercase letters in the row below, as shown in Figure 4.19. Ask children 
to touch and name each letter. Scramble the top row and repeat. Play 
Concentration with the set of uppercase and lowercase letters needed 
to spell a child’s name. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.a, 1.b, 1.d)
	4.25	 Alphabet Scrapbook
Materials  Prepare a book for each child by stapling together 
blank sheets of paper. (Seven sheets of paper folded and stapled in the 
middle is enough for one letter per page.) Children can use this book 
in a variety of ways (see Figure 4.20). (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d, 
3.a, 3.c, 1.a, 2.d)
Procedures
1.	Have children practise writing uppercase and lowercase forms of 
the letter on each page.
2.	Have children cut out letters in different fonts or styles from maga-
zines and newspapers and paste them into their scrapbooks.
3.	Have children draw and label pictures and other things that begin 
with that letter sound.
4.	Have children cut and paste magazine pictures onto the corre-
sponding letter page. These pictures can be labelled, too.
5.	Have children add sight words as they are learned to create a per-
sonal dictionary.
	4.26	 Alphabet Eggs
Materials  Create a simple set of puzzles designed to practice 
pairing uppercase and lowercase letters. On poster board, draw and cut 
out enough four-inch egg shapes for each letter in the alphabet. Write an uppercase letter 
on the upper half and the matching lowercase letter on the lower portion (see Figure 4.21). 
Cut the eggs in half using a zigzag line. Make each zigzag slightly different so the activity is 
self-checking. Children should say the letters to themselves and put the eggs back together by 
matching the uppercase and lowercase form. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d)
Variations  There are many other shapes that can be cut in half for matching. For exam-
ple, use pumpkin shapes in October, or heart shapes in February. There is no end to matching 
possibilities. Acorn caps can be matched to bottoms, balls to baseball gloves, frogs to lily pads,

and so on. You can also create matching sets to pair 
letters and a picture that starts with that letter, rhym-
ing words, contractions, homophones and so on.
 4.27	 Alphabet Concentration
This game works just like Concentration with rhym-
ing words, as described in Activity 4.15. Create cards 
with uppercase and lowercase forms of the letters 
written on one side, using both familiar and not-so-
familiar letters. Be sure they cannot be seen from the 
backside. Do not try this with all 26 letters at once, or 
it may take a long time to complete; eight to ten pairs 
are probably enough. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d) 
Variations  To introduce this game or to make 
it easier, play it with the cards face-up. As children 
learn the letter sounds, matching consonant letters to 
pictures that begin with that letter sound can change 
the focus of this game.
	4.28	 Letter Spin
This fast-paced game helps children practise upper- and lowercase letter recognition. (CCSS 
Foundational Skills 1.d)  
Materials  Make a spinner with six to eight spaces, and label each space with a capital 
letter. If you laminate the spinner before labelling, you can reuse it with other letters. Print 
the letters with a grease pencil or non permanent overhead transparency pen. Write the 
lower­case letters on small cards, creating five or six cards for each letter (see Figure 4.22). See 
­Appendix F for tips on making a spinner.

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
Procedures
1.	Lay out all of the lowercase cards face-up.
2.	Each student, in turn, spins and lands on an uppercase letter. The child then picks up one 
card that has the corresponding lowercase form, orally identifying the letter.
3.	Play continues until all the letter cards have been picked up.
4.	The child with the most cards when the game ends is the winner.
Variations  Ask children to name and write 
the uppercase and lowercase forms of the letter after 
each turn. You can adapt this game to any feature that 
involves matching—letters to sounds, rhymes, vowel 
patterns and so on.
	4.29	 Alphabet Cereal Sort
Materials  For this sorting activity, you need 
a box of alphabet cereal—enough to give each child 
a handful. Prepare a sorting board for each child by 
dividing a paper into 26 squares. Label each square 
with an uppercase or lowercase letter. Other three-
dimensional letters would work just as well as cereal. 
(CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d)
Procedures
1.	Allow the children to work individually or in 
teams to sort their own cereal onto their papers 
(see Figure 4.23).
2.	Allow children to discard (or eat) broken or 
deformed letters.
3.	After the children finish, they can count the num-
ber of letters in each category (e.g., A=8, B=4). 
This could become a graphing activity.
4.	Finally, eat the cereal! (Or glue it down.)
Variations  Have the children spell their names or other words using the 
cereal.
	4.30	 Font Sorts
Children need to see a variety of print styles or fonts to identify their ABCs in 
different contexts. Draw children’s attention to different letter forms wherever 
you encounter them. Environmental print is especially rich in creative lettering 
styles. Encourage children to bring in samples from home—like the big letters 
on a bag of dog food or cereal—and create a display on a bulletin board or in a 
class big book. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d)
Materials  Cut out different styles of letters from newspapers, catalogues, 
magazines and other print sources. You can also search your computer fonts 
and print out letters in a large size. Cut the letters apart, mount them on 
small cards and laminate for durability. Sample font sorts can be found at the 
PDToolkit. Use both capitals and lowercase, but avoid cursive styles for now 
(see Figure 4.24).
Procedures  After modelling the sort with a group of students, place the 
materials in a centre where the children can work independently. Avoid putting 
out too many different letters at one time—four or five are probably enough, 
with 8 to 12 variations for each.

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
Variations  If you created alphabet scrapbooks (Activity 4.25), children can paste in 
samples of different lettering styles.
Letter–Sound Knowledge
Specific guidelines for creating and using picture sorting for initial sounds are described ear-
lier in this chapter, and general guidelines are presented in Chapter 3. Picture and word sorts 
are at the heart of word study and the procedures are revisited throughout this book. Use 
other games and activities to review beginning sounds after children have already practised 
categorising targeted sounds in basic picture sorting activities.
	4.31	 Use Alphabet Books to Enhance Beginning Sounds  
and Introduce Dictionary Skills
Alphabet books can be a child’s first introduction to reference materials such as dictionar-
ies. They can be used to introduce an initial sound or they can be a resource for a word 
hunt as children go searching for more words that start with targeted letters. Watch out 
for the choices authors and artists sometimes make, however. The C page may have words 
that start with the digraph ch (chair), hard c (cat) and soft c (cymbals), which may be confus-
ing. Children will eventually need to sort out these confusions, but not at this time. It’s 
best to limit the C page to just hard C exemplars for starters. (CCSS Foundational Skills 
1.d, 2, 3.a)
Materials  A variety of alphabet books (see list in Activity 4.21), picture dictionaries 
and word books. The Busy Bee Kids Printables website has an ABC book you can download and 
print, and you may find others.
Procedures
1.	Before you start studying individual sounds, see if children can find different letters 
amongst letters placed in alphabetical order, as on an alphabet strip. Once children can 
recite the alphabet in order, select a letter and challenge them to name the letters that 
follow, in order. Even young children first learning the alphabet and beginning sounds are 
ready to use the most basic of dictionary skills—alphabetic order.
2.	When studying a particular beginning sound, pass out alphabet books to pairs of children 
and ask them to find a letter and report what is pictured there. Begin by naming the letter, 
pointing to where it falls in the alphabet and deciding where in the books to look—in the 
first, middle or last part. Otherwise, children may start at the beginning and look through 
the entire book to get to Z!
3.	Create a chart of words or pictures that children find beginning with a particular letter.
4.	Read the list to children several times to emphasise the beginning sound and challenge 
them to find more words over the next week or so. This will reinforce the idea that there 
are many words that begin with a particular letter.
Variations  Picture dictionaries and wordbooks such as those by Richard Scarry or Roger 
Priddy, in which pictures are thematically arranged and labelled with words, are another 
resource that young children enjoy. They are an excellent way to encourage vocabulary 
growth as adults and young children take turns pointing, questioning (“What’s that?”) and 
naming the colourful pictures on the pages. However, young children may ignore the printed 
labels unless they are pointed out. Challenge children to look through such books on a word 
hunt for things that start with a particular letter. For example, if you look on the body parts 
page of such a book you will find several words that start with H—hand, head and hair. Show 
children how to use the printed word as a clue in addition to naming and listening for the 
beginning sound.

	4.32	 Soundline
This centre activity is a good way to review the beginning consonant matches children learned 
in the picture sorts. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d, 2.d, 3.a)
Materials  You will need heavy string or a piece of rope and 
wooden clothespins. Write uppercase and lowercase letters on the 
top of the clothespins. Glue a picture beginning with each letter on a 
square of tagboard and laminate. Prepare two or three for each letter 
that has been studied.
Procedures  Introduce this as a group activity before putting it 
in a centre where children can do it independently. Children match the 
picture card to the clothespin and hang it on the rope (see Figure 4.25). 
Add new letters and sounds as children learn them.
	4.33	 Letter Spin for Sounds
This is a good game to review up to eight beginning sounds at a time. It is a variation of the 
letter spin described in Activity 4.28. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d, 2.d, 3.a)
Materials  You will need a spinner divided into four to eight sections and labelled with 
beginning letters to review; you can use a large cube, like a die, instead of a spinner. You will 
need a collection of picture cards that correspond with the letters, with at least four pictures 
for each letter. Follow the procedures for the letter spin activity.
Procedures
1.	Lay out all the pictures face-up.
2.	Two to four children take turns using the spinner, selecting one picture that begins with 
the sound indicated by the spinner. After selecting, the student’s turn is over and the next 
child spins. If there are no more pictures for a sound, the child must pass.
3.	Play continues until all of the pictures are gone. The winner is the one with the most 
pictures at the end.
	4.34	 Initial Consonant Follow-the-Path Game
This game is simple enough that even preschoolers can learn the rules and use it to practise a 
variety of features. You will see this game adapted in many ways in Chapters 5 and 6. (CCSS 
Foundational Skills 1.d, 2.d, 3.a)  
Materials  Copy the two halves of a follow-the-path game board, found in Appendix F 
and on the website. Keep the game in a folder that can be easily stored: paste each half on the 
inside of a manila folder (coloured ones are nice) leaving a slight gap between the two sides in 
the middle (so the folder can still fold). Add some colour and interest with stickers or cutout 
pictures to create a theme such as “Trip to the Pizza Parlour” or “Adventures in Space”. Label 
each space on the path with one of the letters you want to review, using both uppercase and 
lowercase forms (see Figure 4.26); sets of three to six letter sounds work best. Reproduce a 
set of picture cards that correspond to the letters. Copy them on card stock or glue cutout 
pictures to cards. You will need two to four game pieces to move around the board; flat ones, 
like bottle caps or plastic disks, store well. Keep the pictures and playing pieces in a labelled 
plastic zip-top bag inside the folder.
Procedures
1.	Turn the picture cards face-down in a stack.
2.	Each child draws a picture in turn and moves his or her playing piece to the next space on 
the path that is marked by the corresponding beginning consonant.
3.	The winner is the first to arrive at the destination.

Variations  Place pictures in each space for a “Follow-the-Pictures” game. Children roll 
a die or spin a spinner marked with letters to move to the appropriate space.
Concepts about Print (CAP)
Concepts about print are best learned in the context of reading and writing. Put songs that you 
sing, poems and jingles that you learn, and portions of longer books with catchy memorable 
refrains (such as “I’ll huff and I’ll puff and I’ll blow your house down”) on charts for easy refer-
ence. Use them for print referencing and to develop concept of word.
	4.35	 Who Can Find?
This works best with a big book, chart story or poem you have read several times. It can 
also be used after creating a dictation or other writing. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1.d, 3.a, 
­Language 2, 2.b)
Procedures
1.	After reading a piece of text several times, ask children questions about conventions of print 
such as, “Who can find a period? Who can find a capital A? Who can find the last word 
in the first sentence? Who can find the title? Who can find a word that rhymes with can?”
2.	Call children forward to point to the features of print you name. It is easy to differentiate 
this activity for children at various points of development so that it offers just the right 
challenge. Ask some children to find letters, and ask others to find words.  
	4.36	 Explore the World of Logos
Children can learn to “read” their environment in the prealphabetic or logographic stage in 
which they use shapes, colours and logos to distinguish words. Draw students’ attention to 
these forms of print to emphasise the many functions print serves and the different forms it 
can take. (CCSS Language 2, Foundational Skills 1, 1.a, 3.c)
Materials  Collect commercial labels and logos from cereal boxes, advertisements, signs 
and so on. Encourage children to bring in examples from home. Mount these on card stock.

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
Procedures
1.	Hold up an example, such as the label on a fast food bag, and ask children if they can 
“read” it. Talk about what it says and where it came from.
2.	Create a sentence strip for a pocket chart printed with: “I can read ______”. Insert the 
logo in the empty space.
3.	Put these in a centre for children to use on their own after introducing it in a group.
	4.37	 What Were You Saying?
Many concepts about print can be directly taught by writing in speech bubbles—especially 
speech bubbles connected to students’ own pictures. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1, 1.a, 1.b, 
3.c, Language 2)
Materials  You will need a digital camera to take photos of your students. If you don't 
have a digital camera, find pictures of children engaged in an activity such as kicking a ball to 
a friend or licking an ice cream cone.
Procedures
1.	Print or project a picture that shows children. Ask 
questions to engage your children in recounting the 
event.
2.	Draw a speech bubble coming out of one child’s mouth. 
Explain that the pictures only show what is happening, 
but you can write what the child actually said in the 
speech ­bubble. Prompt by saying something like, “What 
do you think she is saying in this picture?”
3.	Write down what the children say in the speech bubble 
(see Figure 4.27). You can ­reference various aspects of 
print, such as letter–sound matches, capitals and punc-
tuation.
4.	Read what it says in the speech bubble while pointing to 
individual words. Point out once again that the picture 
shows what happened, but the writing in the speech bub-
ble tells what was actually said. Ask individual children to 
come up and read their own speech bubbles.
Variations  Read comic strips, comic books and chil-
dren’s books that feature speech bubbles, such as one of the 
following.
• Peggy Rathman’s 10 Minutes till Bedtime (1999) and Goodnight Gorilla (1994). New York: 
Scholastic.
• Susan Meddaught’s Martha Speaks (1992). Boston: Houghton Mifflin.
• Mo Willems’s Don’t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus (2003), Knuffle Bunny (2004) and their 
sequels. New York: Hyperion Books.
• Easy to read comics known as TOON books. New York: RAW Junior, LLC.
	4.38	 Interactive Writing and Morning Message
The act of writing with children offers you the opportunity to model the use of the alphabet, 
phonemic segmentation, letter–sound matching, concept of word and conventions such as 
capitalisation and punctuation, all in the context of a meaningful group activity. As you write 
on the chalkboard, chart paper or an interactive whiteboard, children see their own ideas 
expressed in oral language transformed into print, allowing many opportunities for print 
referencing. See Table 4.3 on page 136 for ideas about things to point out. During interactive 
writing, children share the pen and are invited to come forward to add a letter, a word or a 
Figure 4.27  Using Speech Bubbles to Teach Concepts 
about Print

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
period. Such writing can take place any time of the day and for any reason; for example, to list 
class rules, make a shopping list, record observations from a field trip, create a new version of 
a familiar text or list questions for a classroom visitor.
Morning Message is a favourite form of group writing in which you and your children 
compose sentences that report on daily home and school events that are important to the 
class. Each morning, talk with the entire group to discover bits of news that can be part of the 
morning message. In preschool or early kindergarten, this may be only one sentence. Keep 
a lively pace and be sure all children are engaged. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1, 1.a-d, 2, 2.d, 
3.a-c, Language 1, 1.a, 1.f, 2, 2.a-d)
Materials  It is important that everyone can see the print. Many teachers use a large 
sheet of chart paper, markers and white tape for covering mistakes. To involve students, give 
each one a lap-sized whiteboard, chalkboard or clipboard so they can participate in listening 
for sounds, handwriting and the use of punctuation.
Procedures
1.	Chat with children informally, sharing news from home or the classroom. This is a time 
for generating lots of talk so do not rush through this step too quickly.
2.	Select a piece of news to record in the form of a single sentence such as, “We will go to 
PE”. Recite the sentence together with the children to decide how many words it con-
tains, holding up one finger for each word. Then draw a line for each word on the board 
or chart (see Figure 4.28).
3.	Repeat each word, emphasising the sounds as they are written, and invite the group to 
make suggestions about what letters are needed: “The first word we need to write is we. 
Wwwwwweeeeee. What letter do we need for the first sound in wwweee?” A child might 
suggest the letter Y. “The name of the letter Y does start with that sound. Does anyone

activities | EMERGENT STAGE
have another idea?” Every letter in every word need not be discussed at length. Focus on 
what is appropriate for the developmental level of your students.
4.	Let children take turns coming forward to write, usually just one child per letter or word 
at this level. You can do the writing in the beginning, but as children learn to write their 
letters you can share the pen. Use white tape to cover any mistakes made on paper. Model 
and talk about concepts about print such as left to right, return sweep, capitalisation, 
punctuation and letter formation. Clap the syllables in longer words, spelling one syllable 
at a time.
5.	After the sentence is completed, read it aloud to the group, touching each word and then 
have the children read with you. If your sentence contains a two- or three-syllable word, 
touch it for every syllable, helping children see how it works. Invite children to come 
forward and fingerpoint as they read.
6.	Repeat steps 2 to 5 for another sentence. Keep in mind children’s attention span when 
deciding how many sentences to write. One sentence may be enough at the beginning.
Variations  Leave up the morning message all day and encourage children to read it on 
their own. You might want to use it for some activities in the next section, such as Cut-Up 
Sentences, Be the Sentence or for the whole-to-part lessons. You can send home a collection 
of all the morning messages for a week on Friday as a summary of class news that most chil-
dren will be able to proudly read from memory to their parents.
Concept of Word in Text (COW-T)
When children are learning about letters and sounds at the same time or they are fingerpoint 
reading from memory, there is a complementary process at work. Learning one gives logic 
and purpose to learning the other. Fingerpoint reading familiar rhymes and pattern books 
followed by deliberate attention to words in and out of context is the best way to achieve a 
COW-T.
	4.39	 The Concept of Word Whole-to-Part Five-Day  
Lesson Framework
You can use the following five-day format with any kind of text—language experience dicta-
tions, poems, rhymes, jingles, songs or parts of a simple patterned book. The key is to limit 
the text to no more than two to eight lines that children can memorise after repeated readings. 
The procedures move from introducing a whole text to the parts. Activities on days 2 to 5 
can vary, depending on the skill of your children and the time you have. (CCSS Foundational 
Skills 1, 1.a-d, 2, 3, 3.a-c, 4)
Materials  You will need chart paper, a pocket chart, sentence strips, envelopes and word 
cards. Record the text on chart paper using print large enough for all to see and/or prepare 
two sets of sentence strips with individual lines from the text. Have word cards ready to record 
selected words. In addition, photocopy or type several lines from the text to give children their 
own single-sheet copy. Glue these into personal readers made from newsprint or blank white 
paper stapled together as described in the next chapter. Leave out the chart, sentence strips 
and word cards for children to use independently as a centre activity after they have been 
introduced in the group.
Procedures 
Day 1. Introduce the whole text.
1.	Have children memorise a rhyme, poem, song or jingle or a patterned refrain from a 
storybook introduced during shared reading. Use simple pictures if possible to help them 

	 166	
CH AP TER 4
activities | EMERGENT STAGE
memorise the lines by heart, as shown in Figure 4.13 (page 140). If children have difficulty 
memorising four or five lines, cut back to two.
2.	Next, introduce the printed text on chart paper or a pocket chart—one sentence per line. 
Model how to read the text by using your finger or pointer to touch every word as you 
say it. Talk about how you are starting with the first word on the left and touching each 
word in the sentence as you say it. Touch multisyllabic words several times and explain why.
3.	Ask the children to read each sentence exactly as you do after you have read it (echo read-
ing). Then invite the children to say it with you (chorally) as you point to each word; this 
is the third reading.
4.	Ask individual children to come up and recite as much of it as you think they are capable of 
while pointing to each word. Be prepared to guide as needed to ensure accurate pointing.
Day 2. Work with the parts (sentences).
1.	Review the text from day 1 by repeating steps 3 and 4 above.
2.	Hand out sentence strips and ask children to find which sentence it matches in the pocket 
chart and place it there. Discuss how they knew it was the same—prompt for specifics like 
“starts with” or “the word…”. Rebuild the text with and without a model for reference. 
Simple pictures like those in Figure 4.13 can help children get the sentence strips in order.
3.	Pass out individual copies of the rhyme. Read this together as every child tracks the print. 
Glue it into their personal readers.
4.	Pair children with a buddy and have them practise reading the rhyme to each other while 
fingerpointing. Ask the non reading buddy to make sure his or her partner is saying and 
pointing to each word. Have each partner read twice.
Day 3. Work with the parts (words).
1.	Repeat steps 4 and 5 from day 1 above.
2.	Pass out individual word cards for each sentence and have children come up and find a 
word and place it on top of its match in the pocket chart. Discuss how they knew it was 
the same word. (Prompt for letters and beginning sounds.)
3.	Pass out the sentence strips along with envelopes containing that particular sentence cut 
up into individual words. Have children rebuild the sentence word by word.
4.	See Cut-Up Sentences (Activity 4.40) and Be the Sentence (Activity 4.41).
Day 4. Work with the parts (letters and sounds).
1.	Use the chart copy or pocket chart to reread the text and then say, “I’m thinking of a word 
in this line that starts with the same sound as ______. What word am I thinking of? How 
did you know?” Or ask children to find words.
2.	Have children reread their own copies. Name words (or letters for children still learn-
ing the alphabet) for them to find and talk about how they found it (what letter or 
sounds they used.) They can highlight or underline 
the words you ask them to find. Children can also 
call out words for each other to find.
3.	Select two to four letter sounds to use as the basis for 
the picture sorting activity described on page 134. 
Repeat the sort over the next few days and complete 
extensions.
Day 5. Review the whole and assess the parts.
1.	Have the children reread the text using the chart 
or personal copies. Select words for a word bank, 
described in the next chapter.
2.	Have children illustrate their rhymes in their per-
sonal readers as a reward for all their hard work.

3.	Assess children using the guidelines described on pages 139 and 141. Ask individual chil-
dren to read the rhyme as they point to the words. Observe how accurately they track 
and whether they self-correct when they get off track. Point to a few words for a child to 
name, or hold up word cards in isolation to name.
4.	Periodically have children reread charts done throughout the year and all the pages in 
their personal readers. Personal readers can go home so children can share their develop-
ing skills. Be sure that parents understand that they will read from memory but should try 
to touch each word as they read.
	4.40	 Cut-Up Sentences
The spaces between words are not always obvious to emergent students, so cutting sentences 
into words is a concrete way to show this. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1, 1.a-d, 2, 3, 3.a-c, 4)
Materials  Write a sentence from a familiar piece of text on a sentence strip. Sentences 
should come from a familiar book or a poem the group has read together. A pocket chart is 
handy to hold the sentences. Prepare a second copy to cut into words.
Procedures
1.	Gather a small group of children with similar needs and read the sentence several times, 
pointing to the words.
2.	Then cut the sentence into words, snipping off each word as you read it aloud. Explain 
to the group that you need their help to rebuild the sentence because the words are all 
mixed up. Pass out the words to children in the group and then, pointing to the words 
in an intact copy of the sentence, ask who has each word as they are named from left 
to right.
3.	Give children clues about how to find the words in order to rebuild the sentence: 
“What letter would you expect to see at the beginning of swam?” The child holding the 
word should come forward and display the word 
under the target word for comparison, checking 
each letter before leaving it in place.
4.	Give each child a copy of the sentence strip and 
scissors. Under your guidance, have them cut off 
each word as it is named and then help them to 
reassemble the sentence. The words can be pasted 
down under a drawing done by the child or put into 
an envelope with the sentence written on the outside 
(see ­Figure 4.29). These can be sent home with the 
students.
5.	Leave the word cards and model sentence strip with 
a pocket chart in a centre for children to practise in 
their spare time.
	4.41	 Be the Sentence
Children can also rebuild familiar sentences by pretending to be the words themselves. 
Write a familiar sentence on a chart or on the board. Start with short sentences such 
as “Today is Monday” or “I love you”. Then write each word from the sentence on a 
large card. Give each word to a student, naming it for him or her. “Stephanie, you are 
the word Monday. Lorenzo, you are the word is”. Ask the children to work together to 
arrange themselves into the sentence. Have another child read the sentence to check the 
direction and order. Try this again with another group of children and then leave the 
words out for children to work with on their own. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1, 1.a-d, 
2, 3, 3.a-c, 4)

	4.42	 Stand Up and Be Counted
As children build a repertoire of known songs, nursery rhymes and jump rope jingles, post 
them around the room and use them for oral concept of word activities that integrate pho-
nological awareness with concept of word in print. (CCSS Foundational Skills 1, 1.a-d, 2, 3, 
3.a-c, 4)
Materials  You will need a memorised nursery rhyme or jump rope jingle posted on the 
wall at an appropriate level. Be sure there is some floor space for everyone to sit in a circle.
Procedures
1.	Sitting in a circle, recall the nursery rhyme or jump rope jingle and recite it as you point 
to the written copy on the wall or chart.
2.	Go around the circle, having children stand up for each word in the nursery rhyme. One 
child will stand up for Hey, another for Diddle, and a third for the next Diddle and so on. 
Watch to see whether two children stand up for a two-syllable word like Diddle or over.
3.	After everyone is finished standing up for each word, have everyone sit down, and say, 
“I think we made some mistakes. Did anyone notice?” Some children will notice. Ask 
them to explain.
4.	Say to the students, “Yes, two people stood up for the word over but over is one word. It has 
two syllables, but it means one thing—over (motion with your hands jumping over some-
thing). Let’s clap the word over. See? Over has two claps, but it’s only one word. Go to the 
chart or wall poster and point out the word over. (You might note that it starts with an o.)
5.	Repeat the exercise.
Variations  Have children recite a sentence or rhyme and add a Lego or Unifix cube 
for each word as it is recited. Count the cubes (words). Compare sentences or lines. Ask 
the students, “Which sentence is longer? How can you tell?” (Longer sentences have more 
words—Legos or Unifix cubes.)
The word study activities for the emergent stage promote concept and vocabulary devel-
opment, awareness of sounds, concepts about print and of word and the alphabetic principle. 
These activities spring from and return to children’s books and are extended through writ-
ing. Once children achieve a concept of word in print and can segment speech and represent 
beginning and ending consonant sounds in their spelling, they are no longer emergent but 
beginning readers. This is also when they move into the next stage of spelling, the letter 
name–alphabetic stage. Word study for the letter name–alphabetic speller/beginning reader 
is described in Chapter 5.

Word Study for Beginners 
in the Letter Name–
Alphabetic Stage

T
he letter name–alphabetic stage of literacy development is a period of beginnings. 
Students begin to read and write in a conventional way. That is, they begin to learn 
words and actually read text, and their writing becomes readable to themselves and 
others. However, this period of literacy development needs careful scaffolding because stu-
dents know how to read and write only a small number of words. The reading materials and 
activities you choose should provide contextual support. In word study, the earliest sorts are 
pictures; later, students work with words in families and words known immediately by sight. In 
the following discussion of reading and writing development and instruction, we look closely 
at the support teachers provide and the way word knowledge develops during this stage. How-
ever, before we examine this stage of word knowledge and provide guidelines for word study 
instruction, let us visit the first-grade classroom of Mr. Richard Perez.
During the first weeks of school, Mr. Perez observed his first graders as they participated in reading and writing 
activities, and he used the PSI inventory described in Chapter 2 to collect samples of their spelling for analysis. The 
efforts of three students are shown in Table 5.1. Like most first-grade teachers, Mr. Perez has a range of abilities in 
his classroom, so he manages three instructional groups for reading and word study, and uses students’ spellings as 
a guide to plan phonics instruction. Some days he uses part of small-group time for teacher-directed word study.
Cynthia is a typical student in the early letter name–alphabetic group who writes slowly, often needing help 
sounding out a word and still confusing some consonants such as y and w and d and t. Her spelling is limited 
primarily to consonants with few vowels. Cynthia has memorised jingles, such as Five Little Monkeys Jumping on the 
Bed, but sometimes gets off track when she tries to point to the words as she reads.
Deciding to take a step back with this group, Mr. Perez plans a quick review of beginning sounds. Every 
three days, he introduces a set of four initial consonants, such as b, m, r and s. After modelling the picture 
sort and practising it in the group, he gives each student a handout of pictures to be cut apart for individual 
sorting practice, as shown in Figure 5.1(A). The next day, the students sort the pictures again and Mr. Perez 
observes how quickly and accurately they work. During seatwork time or centre time, the students draw and 
label pictures beginning with those sounds, paste and label pictures and do word hunts (follow-up routines 
described in Chapter 3).

Figure 5.1   Word Study Handouts for Letter Name–Alphabetic Spellers in Three Different Instructional Groups
Each day when Mr. Perez meets with Cynthia’s group, they read chart stories, jingles and books with pre-
dictable texts. To help the students in this group develop a sight vocabulary, Mr. Perez has a word bank for each 
­student. To create the word bank, he took the words the students could quickly identify from their reading and 
wrote them on small cards for their collections. The students add new words several times a week and review their 
words on their own or with classroom volunteers.
Tony is part of a large group in the middle letter name–alphabetic stage who has beginning and ending 
consonants under good control but shows little accuracy when spelling digraphs and blends, as shown in Table 5.1. 
He is using but confusing vowels in some words. Tony points to the words as he reads Five Little Monkeys and im-
mediately self-corrects on the rare occasion he gets off track with words that have more than one syllable, such as 
jumping and mama.
Mr. Perez has Tony’s group work with picture sorts of digraphs (sh, ch, th and wh) for several weeks and then 
begins the study of same-vowel word families such as op, ot and og. Mr. Perez takes 10 to 15 minutes during group 
time to introduce new word families. The students then receive their own set of words, shown in Figure 5.1(B), to 
cut apart for sorting. They work alone and with partners to practice the sort, writing and illustrating the words and 
then play follow-up games.
Maria represents a third group of students in the late letter name–alphabet stage who correctly spell single 
consonants, as well as many digraphs and blends, as shown in Table 5.1. This group also uses some short vowels 
accurately. Maria can read some levelled books independently and is quickly accumulating a large sight vocabulary 
simply from doing lots of reading.
Mr. Perez reviews different-vowel word families for several weeks, making an effort to include words with 
­digraphs and blends, but he soon discovers that the word family sorts are too easy and decides to move to the 
study of short vowels in nonrhyming words. Each Monday, he introduces a collection of words that can be sorted 
by short vowels into three or four sets. This group also receives a handout of words, as shown in 5.1(C), to cut apart 
and use for sorting. They learn to work in pairs for buddy sorts, writing sorts, word hunts and games on other days 
of the week. ●

Literacy Development of Students  
in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage
Many components of the literacy diet described for the emergent stage continue to develop 
during the letter name–alphabetic stage. Vocabulary, oral language and concepts grow 
throughout all the stages described in this book, but phonological awareness and concept of 
word in text will reach maturity. At the beginning of this stage, students may only segment 
and represent the most prominent beginning and final consonant sounds, demonstrating 
only partial phonemic awareness. By the end of the stage, they have full phonemic awareness 
and are able to isolate the elusive vowels and to pull apart the tightly meshed blends. As they 
learn to segment these sounds, they also learn the letter correspondences that represent them, 
including initial and final consonants, digraphs, blends and short vowels. A new component 
becomes critical during the letter name–alphabetic stage—acquiring a reading vocabulary of 
sight words that can be recognised automatically in any context. It is fast and ever-growing 
word recognition that fuels fluency and comprehension.
Reading
During the letter name–alphabetic stage, students transition from depending on simple, 
­predictable reading materials they read with support from shared reading and their memory 
for language, to less predictable beginning reading materials. With less predictable materials 
they must rely on an expanding sight vocabulary and the ability to figure out unfamiliar words 
using a variety of decoding strategies. This transition in reading material should be accompa-
nied by word study instruction that continues to develop letter–sound correspondences.
Concept of Word in Text.  Students who are solidly in the letter name–alphabetic 
stage of spelling have acquired a concept of word in text—the ability to track or fingerpoint 
read a memorised text without getting off track on a two-syllable word. There are two levels 
of concept of word in text: rudimentary and firm (Blackwell-Bullock & Invernizzi, 2012; Fla-
nigan, 2006, 2007; Morris, 1981; Morris, Bloodgood, Lomax & Perney, 2003).
Rudimentary.  Students with a rudimentary concept of word can point to and track the words 
of a memorised text using their knowledge of consonants as clues to word boundaries. How-
ever, they may get off track with two-syllable words, and when they are asked to find words 
in what they read, they are slow and hesitant. They may voice point by returning to the 
beginning of the sentence or line to get a running start with memory as a support to read and 
locate the requested word. Students with a rudimentary concept of word are able to learn a 
few sight words from familiar stories and short dictations that they have reread several times. 
In word study, students with a rudimentary concept of word are in the early part of the letter 
name–alphabetic stage; they need to review beginning consonants and then study blends and 
digraphs along with same-vowel word families. With a rudimentary concept of word, students’ 
sight vocabulary grows slowly, so most word study is done with picture sorting.
Firm.  Students with a firm concept of word can fingerpoint read accurately, and if they get off 
track they can quickly correct themselves without voice pointing or starting over. When asked 
to find words in the text, students can identify them immediately or nearly immediately. They 
can acquire many sight words after several rereadings of familiar text. Students with a firm 
concept of word are ready to study different-vowel word families and then examine individual 
short vowels and the consonant-vowel-consonant pattern (CVC) for short vowels, including 
short vowel words containing beginning and ending consonant blends. With an expanding 
sight word vocabulary, sorts rely more on words than pictures to support word identification.
Sight Word Learning.  We define sight words as any words that are stored com-
pletely enough in memory to be recognised automatically and consistently in and out of 
context. A large store of sight words makes it possible to read fluently and to devote attention 
for Words Their Way®

to comprehension rather than to figuring out unknown words. It also provides a corpus of 
known words from which students can discover generalisations about how the spelling system 
works. However, beginning readers do not recognise many words by sight and what they 
remember about words may be incomplete. As partial alphabetic readers (Ehri, 2000), they 
know something about consonants, but they lack the vowel knowledge needed to sound out 
words or easily store words in memory. In a familiar rhyming book, like Five Little Monkeys 
Jumping on the Bed by Eileen Christelow, they can point to the words using their memory for 
the rhyming pattern and their knowledge of beginning sounds /f/, /l/, /m/, /j/ and /b/. The 
word monkeys might be recognised out of context by virtue of several letters in the word (m-k 
or m-y perhaps). In another context, however, these partial phonetic cues alone will not suffice. 
Monkeys might be confused with Mike or many.
The term sight words is often confused with high-frequency words, which are the most 
commonly occurring words in print (i.e., was, the, can, these). A list of Fry’s top 300 high-­
frequency words can be found in Appendix E. It is important to understand that though a 
reader’s store of sight words will include many high-frequency words, it is not limited to those 
words; any word can be a sight word.
Another common misunderstanding about sight words is that they are phonetically 
irregular words children cannot sound out and therefore must be learned in a different way, 
as unanalysed wholes or “by sight”. Although there are some high-frequency words that lack 
dependable letter–sound correspondences (of = /uv/ and was = /wuz/), most words are more 
regular than not, especially in the consonant features that are most likely to be partially 
understood. For example, the high-frequency word from is 75 per cent regular; only the o in 
the middle is irregular. There is no evidence that readers learn these words in a different way, 
but like all word learning at this stage, repetition in and out of context, along with word study, 
helps secure these words in memory.
Reading Fluency.  All beginning readers read slowly, except when they are reading 
well-memorised texts, and they are often described as word-by-word readers (Bear, 1989, 
1991b). They do not have enough sight words to permit fluent reading and their reading rates 
may be painfully slow. For example, a beginning reader may read as slowly as 30 words per 
minute, depending on the familiarity, difficulty and genre of the text (Invernizzi & Tortorelli, 
2013). Although fluency is an important goal of learning to read, we find the current focus 
on getting beginning readers to “read fast” a disturbing trend. Chall called the first stage of 
reading the “glued to print” stage (1983). Beginning readers need to pay careful attention to 
the words on the page if they are going to store words fully in memory to build their sight 
vocabularies.
Most beginning readers point to words when they read, and they read aloud to them-
selves. This helps them to keep their place and to buy processing time. While they hold the 
words they have just read in memory, they read the next word, giving them time to fit the 
words together into a phrase. If you visit a first grade classroom during “sustained silent 
reading” (SSR) or during “drop everything and read” (DEAR), you are likely to hear a steady 
hum of voices. Fingerpointing, dysfluency and reading aloud to oneself are natural reading 
behaviours to expect among beginning readers.
Writing
There is a similar pattern of dysfluency in beginning writing because students often write 
words slowly, sound by sound (Bear, 1991a). In the emergent stage of development, writers 
are often unable to later read what they have written because they lack or have limited letter-
to-sound correspondences. Students in the letter name–alphabetic stage can usually read what 
they write depending on how completely they spell, and their writing is generally readable to 
anyone who understands the logic of their letter name strategy.
A first-grader shares her thoughts about winter in the example shown in Figure 5.2. 
Ellie represents most beginning and ending single consonants, as in her spelling of LK for 
like and WR for wear, but the sn blend in snow, spelled SO, is incomplete. Many vowels are

missing, although she does include some that “say their name” as 
in MAK for make and SO for snow. She substitutes a for short i in 
mittens and i for short o in hot. Notice how she uses the letter h to 
represent the ch digraph in chocolate (spelled HIKLT) because the 
name of the letter (aitch) has the sound she is trying to represent. 
Correctly spelled words like Mom and the are probably sight words 
for Ellie.
During this stage you should continue to model writing for a 
variety of purposes, while using print referencing to develop concepts 
about print as described in Chapter 4. Interactive writing and record-
ing students’ individual or group dictations are fertile opportunities 
for print referencing as well as drawing students’ attention to sound 
and letter correspondences. At the same time, students need to write 
for themselves as they spell “as best they can”. Journal writing, let-
ters to friends, observations, predictions before reading and written 
responses after reading provide authentic reasons to learn about let-
ters and sounds.
In the early phases of the letter name–alphabetic stage, you may 
sometimes dictate sentences for students to write. This removes the 
burden of trying to remember what they were trying to write so stu-
dents can concentrate on writing for sounds and using the phonics 
features they have been learning in word study. For example, Tony’s 
group might be asked to write, “Put the top on the hot pot.” Asking 
students to simply copy sentences is of little value. It is the hard work 
of transcribing speech into print that exercises phonemic awareness 
and students’ growing understanding of the orthography.
Vocabulary Learning
Children’s vocabularies continue to grow with exposure to and participation in oral language. 
The quality and quantity of vocabulary growth depends on the richness and frequency of 
verbal interactions with peers and adults. It is very important for you to be mindful and sys-
tematic about teaching students new words in the early childhood years, as a way to close the 
tremendous oral vocabulary gap that exists between children who come from literate homes 
and those who do not (Biemiller, 2005). Talking about the meanings of words or doing lots of 
reading helps, but not enough to enhance the vocabulary learning of those students who need 
it the most (Beck, McKeown & Kucan, 2013). Observations of kindergarten and first-grade 
classrooms reveal that the current focus on teaching phonics in high-risk settings has resulted 
in measurable progress in decoding skills, but without attention to vocabulary these students 
are still at risk in later grades when knowing word meanings is critical for comprehension 
(Juel, Biancarosa, Coker & Deffes, 2003).
There are many ways you can enhance vocabulary development in young students. Read-
ing aloud continues to provide a rich source of new vocabulary as well as complex sentence 
structures. Highlight and discuss several words from a read-aloud throughout the week. 
Interactive read-alouds, “turn and talk”, retellings, dramatisations of stories and other sug-
gestions from Chapter 4, continue to play an important role in stimulating oral language and 
encouraging the use of new vocabulary. In this chapter, we highlight several strategies and the 
activity section features creative dramatics, think-pair-share and anchored word instruction 
(Juel et al., 2003).
Sophisticated Synonyms.  Opportunities exist throughout the day for you to model 
sophisticated words for familiar concepts as a way to promote vocabulary growth. Lane and 
Allen (2010) describe how a kindergarten teacher began the year by asking the “weather 
watcher” to report to the group using terms such as sunny, cloudy or warm. However, as the 
teacher introduced new terms over several months, the appointed “­meteorologist” was expected 
I like winter. I make a snowman in the snow. I 
wear mittens. Mom makes me hot chocolate.
FIGURE 5.2  Ellie Writes about Winter

	 176	
CH AP TER 5
to observe the weather conditions and report their forecast with terms such as brisk, frigid or 
overcast. Lane and Allen suggest that teachers look for, gradually teach and consistently use 
synonyms for the common language of everyday routines. Students can be asked to distribute, 
replenish, dispense or allocate materials. During group discussions participants are encouraged to 
contribute, articulate, verbalise and elaborate their ideas. The class can be asked to queue up adjacent 
to or parallel to the wall and proceed in an orderly fashion. Students are complimented for being 
amiable, agreeable, courteous, proficient, gracious and considerate. Rather than “dumbing down” 
our language to children, we should consciously elevate our language and provide appropriate 
explanations, repeated exposure and opportunities for them to use that same language.
Enrich Simple Text.  Most beginning readers and writers are not able to grow their 
vocabularies through their own reading because the simple predictable texts they use for 
reading instruction rarely include words whose meanings they do not know. However, you 
can infuse more vocabulary as you discuss the story and illustrations using alternative words. 
For example, The Cat Sat on the Mat by Brian Wildsmith, described in Chapter 4, is written 
with very simple, predictable language. However, the cat experiences a range of emotions, 
from contented to uneasy to agitated to furious, as more and more animals gather on the mat. 
Part of your discussion should focus on how the cat feels, offering the opportunity for you to 
introduce many synonyms for happy, sad and mad—the words children are likely to suggest. 
Discussing illustrations will especially benefit English learners, who rely on the illustrations 
to understand much of the story. You might even look up some of the synonyms in their home 
language. Content and furious turn out to be contento and furioso in Spanish! Studying cognates 
(words descended from the same ancestral root) is addressed more in later chapters but it can 
begin in the early stages as well.
Concept Sorts.  Use objects, pictures and known words in concept sorts to expand 
children’s vocabulary and to encourage rich verbal interactions. For example, after read-
ing about and discussing concepts related to weather, students can sort pictures of mittens, 
sandals, sunscreen, jackets and galoshes under the headings of sun, rain and snow. You should 
model and use the language of comparison/contrast: “warmer than, cooler than, not as hot 
as”, and so forth. This explicit attention to language helps students “unpack” what they tacitly 
know about the concepts underlying the labels, and becomes part of their own discussions 
about words and concepts. Students can sort words and pictures multiple times over several 
days. They sort in multiple categories—you can see this when they contrast things they like 
with those they do not like, animals that live in the water or on land and so on. Concept 
sorts for English learners are particularly worthwhile because objects (such as plastic ani-
mals) or pictures can be sorted into categories without needing to know the English terms. 
At the same time, English-speaking partners can supply unknown words and, while talking 
about the sort, students practise using and hearing the vocabulary they hear from you and 
their classmates. In a weather concept sort with English learners, there are several concepts 
students sort into pairs to practise the new vocabulary. English learners in Kristen Polanski’s 
classroom talk about relationships they observe, as when an English learner who speaks 
Hmong as her primary language reports that moon and sun are a pair for “when the sun 
go down and the moon come up”. Vocabulary is learned best when it is used many times in 
phrases and sentences (CCSS, 2010). Concept sorts are included in the activity section that 
follows.
Orthographic Development in  
the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage
Students in the letter name–alphabetic stage provide a wonderful example of how learners 
construct knowledge in an attempt to make sense of the world of print. Without prior knowl-
edge of how to spell words, children carefully analyse the sound system more consciously than

do adults, and they make surprisingly fine distinctions about the ways sounds and words are 
formed in the mouth. They match the phonemes they can segment to the letter names of the 
alphabet in ways that may seem curious and random to the uninformed adult.
Letter Names
Letters have both sounds and names, and students in the letter name–alphabetic stage use 
their knowledge of names of the letters in the alphabet to spell phonetically or alphabetically. 
For example, students in the early part of this stage are likely to spell the word jeep as GP, 
selecting g as the first letter because of its name (“gee”). According to letter name logic, there 
is no need to add the vowel because it is already part of the letter name for g. Sometimes early 
letter name–alphabetic spellers do include vowels, especially when they spell long vowels that 
“say their name”, as Ellie did when she spelled snow as SO. This phenomenon accounts for the 
reason the stage is called letter name–alphabetic. Spellers in this group operate in the first layer 
of English—the alphabetic layer.
A few letter names do not cue students to the sounds they represent. For example, the 
letter name for w is “double u” and the name for h is “aitch”. Neither offers a clue to the 
sound it represents. However, when you say the name of the letter y you can feel your lips 
moving to make the shape of the /w/ sound and the name for h does end with the /ch/ sound. 
Consequently, early letter name–alphabetic spellers may spell witch as YH. Read through the 
letter names in Table 5.2 to see what they offer students in terms of sound matches. Most 
consonants offer a clue to the sound they represent either at the beginning (“bee”) or the end 
(“ef”) of the letter name.
Letter Sounds
Children need to learn not only letter names, but also letter sounds to help them grasp the 
alphabetic principle, the insight that individual speech sounds can be represented by letters 
of the alphabet. Children appear to learn the letter sounds for letters that include the sound in 
their names (b, d, f  ) more easily than letters whose names have no relationship to their sound 
(w, y, h). Letters that are associated with more than one sound (c, g and all the vowels) or let-
ters that share a sound with another letter (k, c, s, g, j ) require more instructional time and 
attention (Huang, Tortorelli & Invernizzi, 2014). Children who demonstrate greater degrees 
of phonological awareness are more likely to learn and retain letter sounds (Piasta & Wagner, 
2010). The initial sounds associated with letters should be examined, compared and contrasted 
and sorted in distributed cycles of review that include attention to letter names, letter sounds 
and letter formation (Jones, Clark & Reutzel, 2013).

During the early part of the letter name–alphabetic stage, when students have only 
partial phonemic awareness, spelling efforts may be limited to the most prominent sounds 
in syllables, usually the beginning and ending consonants. As phonemic awareness improves 
in the middle part of this stage, students’ spellings gradually include a vowel in each stressed 
syllable, and they spell short vowels by matching the way they articulate the letter names of 
the vowels (discussed more later in this chapter). By the end of the letter name–alphabetic 
stage, students have learned how to spell many words with short vowels correctly and with full 
phonemic awareness they also spell blends. Table 5.3 summarises characteristics of the letter 
name–alphabetic stage.
How Consonant Sounds Are Articulated in the Mouth
Knowing something about phonetics (the science of sounds) will help you understand and 
appreciate what young students do as they attempt to represent sounds with letters. When 
they spell, letter name–alphabetic students rely not only on what they hear in the letter names, 
but also on how the letters are articulated, or formed in the mouth. For example, when stu-
dents try to spell the dr in drive, they are misled in their spelling by the similarity between

dr and jr, and they may spell drive as JRV. Say “drive” and “jrive”. Do they sound and feel alike? 
Linguists call these sounds affricates, which are formed by forcing air through a small closure 
at the roof of the mouth to create a feeling of friction (friction, affricatives—see the meaning 
connection?). English has several other letters and letter combinations that create the affricate 
sound and these are often substituted for each other: j, g, ch, dr, tr and the letter name for h 
(aitch). Try saying “jip / chip”, and then “trip / drip” several times to feel the similarity and 
help you understand why young students confuse these affricates.
The voiced and unvoiced consonant pairs discussed in Chapter 4 and listed in Table 4.2 
account for other confusions experienced by letter name–alphabetic spellers. They may spell 
brave as BRAF or oven as OFN. Both v and f are articulated in exactly the same place on the 
lips, but one is voiced and the other is unvoiced. When phonemes are voiced, the vocal cords 
vibrate. You can feel the difference in the first sound of van compared to fan. One implication 
for instruction is that students in the letter name–alphabetic stage benefit from saying the 
words aloud as they are sorting so that they can feel the sound differences. Another implica-
tion is that when you first teach these sounds, avoid contrasting voiced and unvoiced pairs: 
b/p, d/t, g/k, z/s, v/f and j/ch (Purcell, 2002), as suggested by the sixth principle described in 
Chapter 3, “begin with obvious contrasts”. Only when most consonant sounds are mastered 
should students focus attention on these finer distinctions. This is especially true for English 
learners, who may not have one of the contrasting sounds in their primary language.
When talking about letter sounds with students, it is important to realise that some are 
rather difficult to say in isolation. Try to say the sound for b. What vowels did you attach to 
the b? If you said the letter name (“bee”), then you used the long e vowel. If you said “buh”, 
the sound associated with b, you attached the schwa sound (/ə/ = “uh”). Now try to say a /b/ 
sound without a vowel. Try to whisper b and cut your breath short in a whisper. The whisper 
is as close as you come to separating the vowel from the consonant sound. Consonant sounds 
that cannot be held like these are known as stop consonants (b, d, g, k, p, t). Other consonants, 
known as continuants (f, l, m, n, r, s, v, z), can be said slowly without adding a vowel. You may 
find there are times when saying the sound in isolation draws attention to the feature of inter-
est, but asking students to say “D says duh, duh, duh” is not the goal of word sort lessons. D 
says “duh” only in words like duck and dump; it says “dee” in words like deal or deed. The goal 
of word study is to extrapolate the sound of D across many different exemplars.
Vowels in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage
Vowels pose special problems for letter name–alphabetic spellers, who rely on the names of 
letters and how sounds feel in the mouth. Try saying the word lip. You can feel the initial con-
sonant as your tongue curls up towards your palate and you can feel the final consonant as it 
explodes past your lips, but did you feel the vowel? Unlike consonants—articulated by tongue, 
teeth, lips and palate—vowels are determined by more subtle variations in the shape of the 
mouth. In addition, they are tightly wedded to the consonants around them.
The major difference in the medial vowel sounds is described linguistically as tense 
and lax. The vocal cords are tense when producing the long a sound (ate), but relax a bit in 
producing the short a sound (at). The vowels we call “long” are no longer in duration than 
short vowels; the terms are holdovers from Classical Latin. Although these terms may not be 
the most accurate terms linguistically, they are more common than tense and lax and teachers 
understand each other when they are used. The simplest way to talk about vowels is probably 
the best. Descriptions like “the sound in the middle” may suffice to draw students’ attention to 
the vowels at first, but students have no trouble learning long vowel and short vowel; such terms 
make word study discussions easier.
How Vowels Are Articulated in the Mouth.  Through the letter name–
alphabetic stage, students become adept at fully segmenting words into phonemes, including 
the medial vowel, and they use the alphabetic principle to represent each sound with a letter. 
Long vowels say their letter name, so the letter choices are obvious. Students spell line as LIN, 
rain as RAN and boat as BOT. Perhaps what is most interesting about the letter name–alphabetic  

	 180	
CH AP TER 5
stage is the way students spell the short vowels. They 
turn to the names of the letters, but find no clear 
letter–sound matches for the short vowel sounds. For 
example, there is no letter name that says the short i 
sound in bit or the “uh” sound in cup. Very early letter 
name–­alphabetic spellers might use f (“ef”) or s (“ess”) 
for short e because the letters name start with the 
short e sound. Spellers throughout the letter name–
alphabetic stage use their knowledge of the alphabet 
to find the letter name closest to the place of articula-
tion of the short vowel sound they are trying to write.
You may have never analysed sounds at this level, 
so let’s take a moment to consider the vowels, and 
where and how sounds are made in the vocal tract. In 
Figure 5.3, the vowels are placed to mimic the gen-
eral area where you can feel their place of articula-
tion. Vowels are subtly differentiated by the shape of 
the mouth, the openness of the jaw and the position 
of the tongue when a word is said. They are all voiced because it is impossible to articulate a 
vowel sound without vibrating the vocal cords. Compare the vowels in this figure by saying 
the following words in sequence several times and trying to identify where the vowel sound 
is produced:
beet
bit
bait
bet
bat
bite
but
bot
ball
boat
book
boot
Do you feel how producing the vowels moves from high in the front of the oral cavity 
(beet) to low in the oral cavity (bite) to the back of the oral cavity (bot), down the front, back 
and up (boot)? Also contrast the way your lips feel when you say the rounded vowel in boot with 
the high front vowel sounds in beet or bit.
The way a word is pronounced may vary by dialect. For example, many people say caught 
and cot the same way. Some rhyme roof with hoof while others rhyme roof with poof. Although 
these dialectical differences do not interfere with learning to spell, being aware of these differ-
ences when students sort and talk about words enhances word study. Everyone speaks a dialect, 
but we all learn to read and write the same orthography.
A Letter Name Strategy to Spell Short Vowels.  Students in the 
letter name–alphabetic stage use their knowledge of letter names and the feel of the vowels 
as they are produced in the vocal tract to spell bed as BAD. Without being consciously aware 
that they are doing this, letter name–alphabetic students spell short vowels with the letter 
name closest in articulation to that short vowel. There are five letter names from which to 
choose: a, e, i, o and u. How would an alphabetic speller spell the word bed? What letter 
name is closest to the short e sound in bed? Try saying bed/bead and bed/bait to compare how 
the short vowel sounds and the long vowels or letter names feel in your mouth. Repeat the 
pairs several times and pay attention to how your mouth is shaped. The short e sound is 
closer in place of articulation to the long a or letter name for a than it is to the letter name 
for e. Students might spell ship as SHEP for a similar reason—the short i sound is closer to 
the letter name for e than the letter name for i. (If you look at Figure 5.3, you will see how 
short i and long e are both high front vowels, whereas the long i is a low front vowel.) Short 
a poses little problem for spellers because the letter name for a is already close in place 
of articulation. This is a good reason to teach it first. However, because short e is close to 
short a, these pairs are not good contrasts for first introducing short vowel sounds. Table 5.4 
will help you remember how the letter names of vowels are substituted for the short vowel 
sounds beginning readers try to spell. The amazing thing about these letter name substi-
tutions for short vowels is that they are so predictable. Read (1975) found that nearly all 
FIGURE 5.3  Vowels in the Mouth

	
Word Study for Beginners in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage	
181
students go through a period when they substitute 
the short vowels with other letter names closest in 
articulation.
Systematic word study helps students in the let-
ter name–alphabetic stage learn to spell short vowel 
words correctly. They see that short vowels follow 
a specific pattern—a consonant-vowel-consonant 
(CVC) pattern. Regardless of how many consonant 
letters are on either side of the single vowel (cat, 
clap, clack or strap), one vowel letter in the middle 
signals the short vowel sound. The CVC pattern is 
introduced in the late letter name–alphabetic stage 
and is contrasted with long vowel patterns in the 
within word pattern stage.
Sometimes students in the letter name–­
alphabetic stage may spell bent, bet, bat and bait the same way as BAT. But letter name–­
alphabetic spellers are also readers, and when they reread their own spelling of bait as bat, a 
word that they know spells something else, they experience disequilibrium (Bissex, 1980). This 
forces them to find other ways to spell a word like bait, perhaps as BATE. When students are 
able to spell basic short vowel patterns and also begin to experiment with long vowel patterns, 
they have entered the next spelling stage: the within word pattern.
Other Orthographic Features
In addition to short vowels, students work through four other features during the letter name–
alphabetic stage: (1) consonant digraphs, (2) consonant blends, (3) preconsonantal nasals and 
(4) influences on the vowel from certain surrounding consonants.
Consonant Digraphs and Blends.  Letter name–alphabetic spellers take some 
time to learn the consonant units known as digraphs and blends. A digraph is composed of 
two letters that represent a single sound. Digraphs are generally easier than blends because 
they only require segmenting and attending to a single phoneme. The digraphs studied in this 
stage include the bold letters in thin, fish, each and when. They can come at the beginning 
or end of words.
The digraph th actually represents two different sounds that are the same in articula-
tion but different in voicing. The th in bath and thin is unvoiced while the th in bathe and 
then is voiced. Most children (and adults) ignore this difference—if they are aware of it at all. 
However, English learners may need to have the differences discussed. Listen as they try to 
pronounce words with th and offer help as needed.
A consonant blend is slightly different. A blend is a spelling unit (sometimes called a 
consonant cluster) of two or three consonants that retain their identity. Each sound in a blend 
can be heard, but they are tightly bound and not easily segmented into individual phonemes, 
making blends difficult for students to spell accurately. This is why the t in the st blend may be 
omitted in stick, as in the spellings SEK or SEC. In English, blends can occur at the beginning 
or end of syllables, as shown by the bold letters in the following words: black, clap, trap, just, 
lisp and mask. If you have trouble remembering these terms it may help to know that blend 
begins and ends with the blends bl and nd, while digraph ends with ph (a digraph representing 
the /f/ sound studied in later stages).
Preconsonantal Nasals.  Some final blends are especially difficult, deserving 
special mention. The nasal sounds associated with m, n and ng are made by air passing through 
the nasal cavity in the mouth. Nasals that come right before a final consonant, such as the n in 
pink, are known as preconsonantal nasals. Try saying bad, ban and then band or bang as you pay 
attention to the sounds. You cannot feel the n in band because it passes out through the nose on 
the way to the d, but it is definitely there! Preconsonantal nasals are often omitted by ­spellers

during the letter name–alphabetic stage (pink may be spelled PEK and jump may be spelled 
JOP). When students begin to spell words with preconsonantal nasals correctly, they are usu-
ally at the end of the letter name–alphabetic stage, having achieved full phonemic awareness.
Consonant Influences on the Vowel.  The letters r, w and l influence the 
vowel sounds they follow. For example, the vowel sounds in words like bar, ball and saw are 
not the same as the short vowel sounds in bat and fast even though they have the CVC pat-
tern. The consonant sounds /r/ and /l/ are known in linguistics as liquids because they roll 
around in the mouth and have vowel-like qualities. Both can change the pronunciation of 
the vowel they follow. These spellings are often known as r-influenced (or r-controlled) and 
l-influenced (or l-controlled). The w also has an effect on vowels that follow it in words such 
as want, was, wash, word and war.
It can be difficult to spell r-influenced vowels by sound alone. For example, fur, her and 
sir have the same vowel sound (represented as /ər/) yet are spelled three different ways. In 
addition, it is impossible to isolate a vowel from the r that follows in words like these. The 
r-influenced vowels that follow a CVC pattern (car, for) are examined during the late letter 
name–alphabetic stage and can be compared with short vowels in word sorts. Students might 
also contrast consonant blends with an r (fr, tr, gr) and r-influenced vowels (e.g., from/form, 
grill/girl, tarp/trap) as a way to compare exactly where the r falls.
Spelling Strategies in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage
Young writers do not know how spell many words from memory, so if we want them to express 
their ideas in writing we need to encourage them to use invented spelling or developmental 
spelling. Children at the letter name–alphabetic stage benefit from the phonemic analysis and 
letter–sound matching involved in figuring out a word as they write independently. This active 
analysis and application of growing skills is much more beneficial than simply being given the 
spelling (Clarke, 1988). In addition, waiting for someone to come by and give them a word can 
slow down their production. In general, avoid providing the spelling for words for students 
in this beginning stage as they write; instead, encourage them to spell “as best they can”. You 
can make exceptions. For example, if children write about a specific topic, like autumn, you 
can brainstorm and post a word bank of special words they could use, such as leaves, cool, fall-
ing and down. Such a word bank can often help reluctant writers get started, but beware of an 
overreliance on copying.
Frequently model how to break words into syllables and slowly stretch out the sounds 
to match to a letter. Do this during interactive writing and other times when you write for 
and with students, but select words that have regular letter sound matches (e.g., flat but not 
laugh) to model. Look for ideas about introducing invented spelling to students on page 52 
in Chapter 2. Also model and teach students how to use resources in the room such as their 
sound boards, word banks, word walls or other word displays around the room. Parents need 
to understand the rationale behind invented spelling, so be ready to communicate with them 
about the value of letting children spell as best they can.
What about children who won’t invent? Sometimes you have students who resist spelling 
as best they can and are anxious that every word is spelled correctly. While we want students 
to develop a spelling conscience, or a desire to spell correctly, such over-concern at this point 
in their development will likely severely limit what they can write about as well as the practice 
they get when they try to figure out words. For example, one of the authors had a first-grader, 
T.J., who spelled every word correctly using beautiful handwriting. But T.J. wrote almost the 
same thing in his journal every day. It was a cause for celebration when T.J. began to misspell 
as he took risks and wrote about a wider variety of topics.
Briefly talk with students about their spelling in independent work and nudge them to 
apply what they have learned. For example, Sabina wrote about playing with her sister: “I like 
to PLA WIT mi STR.” Her teacher complimented her on spelling “like” correctly and asked 
how she knew it. Sabina replied that she had used the word wall. The teacher then pointed to 
with and said, “Here’s a word that is almost correct. Listen to the end of the word ‘with.’ Do

183
you hear that special sound that needs two letters? It is the sound you hear at the beginning 
of thumb (referring to a sound board with digraphs). You sorted words with TH several weeks 
ago. Can you fix that word?” In this way, the teacher held Sabina accountable and helped her 
apply what she knew. Other words (play as PLA and sister as SSTR) were left as Sabina’s best 
efforts based on her current word knowledge.
It is too early to ask students in the letter name–alphabetic stage to look up words in a 
standard dictionary that they need for writing, but we recommend that you keep a dictionary 
handy and occasionally model how you use one. This is a good time to introduce students 
to the delights of age-appropriate picture dictionaries and wordbooks where they might find 
labelled pictures arranged thematically as a source of ideas for writing. Refer to Activity 5.15 
for ideas about how to teach beginning dictionary skills and a list of resources.
Word Study Instruction for  
the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage
This section starts with a discussion of how to support beginning readers as they acquire a 
concept of word in text and build a sight word vocabulary. In the whole-to-part model we 
propose, students learn to read big books, poems and jingles at the same time they study 
letter–sound correspondences through picture and word sorts. This analytic phonics 
approach begins with whole words that are broken into letters and sounds that students 
can compare and examine. Synthetic phonics has a different sequence. Students are 
taught vowel sounds (usually short vowels) along with consonants in isolation, and then are 
expected to blend those sounds to decode words as they read in text that is controlled by 
phonic regularity. We believe an analytic approach to phonics represents an easier and more 
engaging entry into the world of reading. Although students are taught to sound out words, 
this is not the starting point for the phonics instruction we recommend. Learning to blend 
letters and sounds together is addressed in the study of word families and short vowels (see 
Activities 5.22 and 5.23 for examples). Be assured that all the phonics features are covered 
in a systematic way.
Reading Instruction
Beginning reading should focus on solidifying a concept of word in text so that students can 
begin to amass a sight word vocabulary as quickly as possible. Think of acquiring sight words 
as establishing an orthographic lexicon, a mental dictionary of known written words organised 
by spelling patterns. It is best to acquire sight words by reading and rereading familiar texts 
and by analysing known words out of context, in word study. Through rereading, students 
see the same words over and over again, thereby increasing the number of words they can 
recognise automatically.
The more words students can recognise automatically, the greater the opportunity for 
making generalisations across words in their word sorts. The result is a general increase in 
word knowledge. But what students know about particular words during the letter name–
alphabetic stage may only be partial. For example, as they read, early letter name–alphabetic 
spellers may substitute leopard for lion in a story about big cats at the zoo. Those errors indi-
cate that they are attending to beginning letters for cues. This is also evident in the way they 
spell during this time—they might spell lion as LN. Ehri (2000) has described these readers as 
“partial alphabetic”, because their letter–sound knowledge is not automatic or complete and 
they use only partial letter–sound cues (usually consonant cues) to identify and spell words. 
Partial information is not enough to ensure fast and accurate word recognition. Instead, letter 
name–alphabetic spellers need support to make reading happen.
Support Reading.  Without a large sight vocabulary beginning readers cannot read 
very much without some kind of support. Support can come from two sources: the text and 

	 184	
CH AP TER 5
the teacher. Predictable text has repetitive patterns, rhyme and simple language that make 
it memorable when students have recited or sung it, or read or heard it, many times. Texts 
are also easy to read when the words are about an event students experienced first-hand, as 
in individual and group dictations created using the language experience approach (LEA) 
described in the last chapter (also see Activity 5.9). Your support comes from shared reading 
strategies such as reading the text aloud and then encouraging students to read in unison 
(choral reading) or immediately after you read (echo reading). Or you might provide a 
book introduction (Clay, 1991) that uses the language of the text and anticipates difficult 
words and concepts.
Tension lies between these two forms of support. The more predictable a text is, the 
less your support is needed. Conversely, the less support provided from recurring elements 
of text, the more scaffolding is required from you. During the letter name–alphabetic stage, 
students move from reading primarily predictable books to texts that are more controlled 
in terms of high-frequency words and decodability (Mesmer, Cunningham & Heibert, 
2012). As students develop a sight vocabulary and letter–sound knowledge, they need less 
support.
Sight Word Learning.  Acquiring a sight vocabulary is critical to becoming a flu-
ent reader, but progress is slow during the early letter name–alphabetic period and students 
need repeated exposure to words to fully store them in memory. Taking words they first 
encounter in context and examining them out of context makes a difference in how well 
students learn those words (Ehri & Wilce, 1980), and how many words they learn over time 
(Johnston, 1998, 2000). Other things influence word learning such as repeated exposure and 
the nature of the words themselves. For example, words that have concrete referents (e.g., 
nouns and adjectives like moon or green) or that are easily visualised (e.g., action verbs like 
run) are easier to learn than abstract prepositions, articles or adverbs (such as from or when), 
which have no meaning by themselves (Mesmer et al., 2012). Chapter 4 provides details for 
examining words through in-text and out-of-text activities in whole-to-part activities. Stu-
dents can be actively involved in the process of determining which words they want to learn 
through the use of word banks.
Word Banks.  Lifting words out of context and writing them on small cards to make a word 
bank is an effective way to build a reading vocabulary or sight word vocabulary. Word banks 
are collections of known words gathered from the texts that students have been reading and 
rereading, to be reviewed in isolation (Stauffer, 1980). Why do students need to review words 
they already know? The answer is they do not know them the same way more mature readers 
do; they know them only partially and tentatively. Letter name–alphabetic students may con-
fuse ran and run, stop and ship, lost and little because they have them stored partially in memory 
as r_n, s_p or l_t. They may read gingerbread correctly every time because it is the only long 
word they know that starts with g, but when you ask them to spell it (GRBRD) you get a better 
idea of what they really know about the word.
The words in a word bank come from many sources that students read and reread: 
predictable books, preprimer readers, levelled books, poems and individual and group dic-
tations. By using words from familiar readings and numbering the stories and rhymes to 
correspond to word cards, you can encourage students to return to the primary source to 
find a forgotten word and to match the word bank card to its counterpart in print. Regularly 
reviewing word bank words encourages students to look more thoroughly at words and to 
note individual letter–sound correspondences. As they study initial sounds through picture 
sorts, ask students to find words in their word banks that start with those same sounds. This 
helps them make connections between the pictures they sort and the words they read. Later 
in the letter name–alphabetic stage, the word bank becomes a source of known words to be 
used in word sorts.
Word banks take extra work but are well worth the effort, particularly for students early in 
this stage who are not making good progress in reading. They motivate students because they 
offer tangible evidence of growing word knowledge (Johnston, 1998). When the word bank 

	
Word Study for Beginners in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage	
185
contains between 150 and 200 words and the stu-
dent is at the end of the letter name–alphabetic 
stage, the word bank can be discontinued. If you 
find it overwhelming to manage individual word 
banks, an alternative is to have one collection 
that students in a reading group share. More 
guidelines for word banks and other sight word 
activities can be found in the activities at the end 
of this chapter.
Personal Readers.  Collect copies of familiar 
rhymes and jingles, group or individual dictations 
or selected passages from books that children 
have read in a personal reader (Bear, Caserta-
Henry & Venner, 2004); see Figure 5.4. Students 
are enormously proud of their personal readers 
and they reread the selections many times before 
taking them home to read some more. Personal 
readers are an ideal place for students to collect 
words for their word banks. They can simply 
underline the words they know best and these 
words can then be transferred to small cards. A 
number can be written on each word card that matches the numbered stories.
In Figure 5.4, the student’s word bank is a plastic bag that can be stored in the personal 
reader; little levelled books fit inside the front pocket. In addition, a small soundboard (see 
Appendix B) of consonant sounds is included for reference in word study and writing. The 
personal reader might also contain a page that lists the words in the student’s word bank.
Sequence and Pacing of Word Study
Converging evidence from research (NRP, 2000) has established that children need systematic 
phonics instruction, but there is disagreement about the nature of that instruction and the 
exact sequence. Our recommended sequence, outlined in Table 5.5, is based on research in 
children’s spelling over several decades, which has revealed the developmental order in which 
phonics features are typically mastered. This is one reason we call this book Words Their Way. 
Initially, students use beginning consonants in their writing, so this is the place to begin word 
study in the early letter name–alphabetic stage. As their ability to segment phonemes becomes 
more complete later in the stage, they begin to use but confuse short vowels and consonant 
blends. This is the time to study those features.
Although there is a predictable pattern of development, the exact sequence and pace is not 
the same for every student because they progress at different rates. (See the three columns in 
Table 5.5 for ideas about how to modify the pace.) However, there is no time to waste—you 
must set as fast a pace as possible during the letter name–alphabetic stage because success in 
beginning reading depends on learning the basic phonics elements that are covered in this 
stage. Pacing should be tied to ongoing assessment to determine whether instruction is effec-
tive. We discuss progress monitoring for this stage on pages 194 and 195.
Placing students in the early, middle or late parts of this stage using the spelling inven-
tory depends primarily on how well they spell short vowels. If students do not attempt vowels, 
they are in the early part of the stage. If they use but confuse vowels, perhaps getting one or 
two correct on an inventory, they are in the middle of the stage. If they spell half or more of 
the short vowels on an inventory, they are in the late letter name–alphabetic stage. If students 
are spelling most short vowels, as well as most digraphs and blends, they are ready to move 
to studying long vowels in the within word pattern stage, in which short vowels are reviewed 
as long vowels are introduced. Table 5.3 helps you identify whether students are in the early, 
middle or late part of the stage.

The Study of Consonant Sounds
Word study in the early letter name–alphabetic stage begins with picture sorts to focus stu-
dents’ attention on initial consonant sounds. Picture sorts help students continue to develop 
their phonemic awareness as they isolate beginning sounds and learn to pull apart consonant 
blends.
You can find pictures for sorts in Appendix C and prepared sorts on PDToolkit and in the 
other books in the Words Their Way® series. Chapter 3 identified follow-up activities, such as 
draw and label or cut and paste, and many of the games described for beginning consonants 
in Chapter 4 can be easily adapted for this stage. There are also games on PDToolkit that are 
ready to print and use.
Initial Consonants.  Mr. Perez, whom we met at the beginning of this chapter, was 
wise in deciding to take a step back to firm up Cynthia’s understandings of consonants. Many 
students benefit from a fast-paced review of consonants at the beginning of first grade to se-
cure tentative letter–sound matches. There is no particular order to the sequence of 
beginning sounds, but we recommend starting with frequently occurring initial con-
sonants, in which the contrasts or differences are clear both visually and phonologi-
cally. You might find that the sequence listed in Table 5.5 is effective for a review, 
but bear in mind that some beginning sounds are easier than others, depending on 
the relationship of the sound to the letter name. Because of this, some contrasts will 
take more time than others.
Figure 5.5 is an example of a sort that started with pictures and then included 
sight words from the students’ word banks. Chapter 4 offers suggestions for how 
to plan and carry out picture sorts for initial sounds and the activity section has 
suggestions for further practice. You can include picture sorts with initially occur-
ring short vowels here as a way to introduce those letter–sound correspondences.
Some students may still be confused with certain letter sounds based on let-
ter name mix-ups (e.g., y and w) or voiced and unvoiced pairs (e.g., b and p), and 
therefore benefit from specific word study activities that contrast those pairs. In 
particular, English learners benefit from word study that addresses confusions that 
arise because of sounds that are missing or that are different in their native lan-
guage. Picture sorts can clarify beginning consonant sounds in English that may 
not exist in other languages like those sounds described in Table 5.7. For example, 
Spanish speakers may sort a series of pictures that begin with /j/ or /h/ to clarify the 
differences in these sounds in English, but which do not occur in Spanish. For Chinese 
speakers, it helps to spend time studying nasal sounds to compare /n/ and /ng/. Span-
ish speakers also benefit from studying s-blends, a combination that does not exist in 
Spanish. Arabic speakers may sort pictures that begin with a voiced /g/ as in goat and a 
voiceless /k/ as in coat (Helman , Bear, Invernizzi, Templeton & Johnston, 2009, 2011).
Beginning consonants are reviewed and ending consonants are targeted in same-
vowel word families. Most students do not need to study ending consonant sounds 
with picture sorts, perhaps because once they develop the phonemic awareness to 
attend to final sounds, they transfer their knowledge of letter–sound matches to 
spell those final consonants as well. Some students may have a few problems even 
when they know most consonant matches, but do not hesitate to move on if they are 
beginning to represent vowels in their invented spellings. English learners whose 
native language does not have many ending consonants may need more sorts with 
final consonant sounds.
After students know their consonant sounds, they are ready to learn about 
consonant digraphs and blends. The goal is to not only master letter–sound cor-
respondences, but also to help students see these two-letter combinations as single 
orthographic units in the CVC pattern.

CH AP TER 5
Digraphs.  Digraphs are introduced before blends because there is only one phoneme to 
deal with, but most students are ready to study both at about the same time. The consonant 
digraphs to study in the letter name stage are ch, sh, th and wh. (We do not include ph at this 
point because there are few words that beginning readers will encounter that begin with 
ph.) There are several things to keep in mind when setting up picture sorting contrasts for 
digraphs. First, consider the confusion students show in their spelling attempts. Some students 
substitute j for ch, as they spell words like chin as JN, or they may confuse the letter name of h 
(aitch) with ch and spell chin as HN. Consider a contrast to study ch that compares pictures that 
start with ch with single consonants, such as h. You can compare th to single t, sh to single s and 
ch to single c. However, it is difficult to sort pictures by w and wh because many words begin-
ning with wh do not have a distinctive sound. (Which witch was which?) Compare wh to th, 
sh and ch in a culminating digraph sort. Add known words to picture sorts, as shown in Figure 
5.5; include question words starting with wh (who, what, when and why). Table 5.5 contains a 
suggested sequence and possible contrasts for studying digraphs. Digraphs are revisited in the 
study of word families and short vowels in both initial and final positions.
Blends.  You can group beginning consonant blends into three major and one minor 
categories as follows:
s-blends: sc, sk, sl, sn, sm, sp, st, sw
l-blends: bl, cl, fl, gl, pl, sl
r-blends: br, cr, dr, fr, gr, pr, tr
Blends with /w/: qu, tw
The easiest group to learn seems to be the s-blends, because s is a continuant that you 
can hold without distorting the sound (sssss). Blends with the “slippery” l or r are the hard-
est because some are confused with affricatives such as j. In qu, the u is acting as a consonant 
representing the /w/ sound. Three-letter blends (spr, str, squ, thr, shr) are less common and not 
studied until the within word pattern stage.
To study initial consonant blends, begin with picture sorts that contrast a single initial 
consonant with its blend. This is the problem for spellers such as Tony, who spell stick as SEK. 
To help Tony listen for the sounds in the blend, contrast st with pictures that begin with s. 
After studying several blends in this fashion, pick up the pace and introduce other blends in 
groups; see Table 5.5 for suggestions. Once students catch on to how blends work and learn 
to segment and blend the individual sounds in a consonant blend, they may move quickly 
through a sequence of study or even skip some contrasts altogether. The procedures and rou-
tines for studying digraphs and blends using picture sorts are the same as for other beginning 
sound sorts, as described in Chapter 4.
Students in the early part of the letter name–alphabetic stage do not need to master 
consonant blends and digraphs completely because they will be revisited throughout the stage 
by studying word families and short vowels. Research by Johnston (2003) and others shows 
that blends, digraphs and short vowels all begin to appear in students’ spelling about the same 
time, so there should be some interplay among these features in the instructional sequence, as 
shown in Table 5.5. Consonant blends and digraphs that create an affricate sound (trip, drip, 
chip) take longer to master because their sounds are so similar.
Final consonant blends (last, lisp, task, left, kept, felt, shelf and help) are not studied with 
pictures, due to a lack of examples, but should be included towards the end of the stage in the 
study of short vowel words. Other ending blends that include an r, like rd, rt and rp, in words 
like bird, art or chirp, are studied with r-influenced vowels.
Preconsonantal nasals, a particular type of final blend that includes mp, nt, nd and nk, are 
also studied at the end of the letter name stage. We add the digraph ng as well, which may be 
studied in word families, as there are many words spelled with ang, ing, ong or ung. ­Appendix E 
has lists of words by families that include words with preconsonantal nasals among them. Many 
students find this feature particularly difficult and will need explicit routines for making words 
with and without the nasal, changing rag into rang or hug into hung, for example. The building, 
blending and extending exercises described in Activity 5.22 can be adapted for this.

The Study of Short Vowels
Once letter name–alphabetic spellers have a solid, if not complete, mastery of beginning and 
ending consonant sounds, they are ready to study medial short vowels. Students need full 
phonemic awareness to isolate the elusive vowel, but if vowels are still missing or used only 
occasionally in their spelling, start the study with word families as Mr. Perez did with his 
middle group. Once students are using (though still confusing) short vowels consistently, ask 
them to compare short vowels in word sorts that examine the CVC pattern across a variety 
of vowels, as Mr. Perez did with his highest group. Appendix D contains lists of words spelled 
with short vowels which you can use to create handouts similar to those used by Mr. Perez in 
Figure 5.1(C). Appendix D also has suggested sorts, and prepared games and more sorts are on 
the website and in Words Their Way®: Word Sorts for Letter Name–Alphabetic Spellers.
Word Families.  Word families, which are sometimes called phonograms, consist of 
groups of rhyming words like cat, mat, sat and bat that are spelled similarly. They offer an easy 
and appealing way to introduce vowels early in this stage. This supports students in their first 
efforts to analyse the vowel because the vowel and the ending letter(s) are presented as a chunk 
or pattern called a rime (e.g., the at in cat and mat). What comes before the vowel is the onset. 
Examples of onset-rime breaks are m-an, bl-and, m-at and th-at. It is easier and more natural 
for students to divide words into onsets and rimes than divide them into individual phonemes 
(Goswami, 2008; Treiman, 1985).
Studying word families makes sense for several other reasons. First, 37 rimes can be used 
to generate 500 different words that students encounter in primary reading materials (Wylie &  
Durrell, 1970). In addition, these same rimes are familiar chunks in thousands of multisyllabic 
words: the an chunk can be found in canyon, fantastic and incandescent. Second, vowel sounds 
are more stable within families than across families (Adams, 1990; Wylie & Durrell, 1970). 
For example, the word dog is often presented as a short o word in phonics programmes, but 
in some regions of the United States, it is pronounced more like dawg. If you say it that way, 
then you probably pronounce fog as fawg, frog as frawg and log as lawg. When studying word 
families, the actual pronunciation of the short vowel does not matter, it is the og chunk that is 
examined and compared.
Same-Vowel Word Families.  Knowing that students in the early letter name 
stage have trouble with the medial vowel, it is a good idea to compare word families that 
share the same vowel before contrasting different vowels. This supports students’ first efforts 
to read and spell those words. What they really must attend to are the beginning and ending 
consonants in order to sort and spell the words. Studying same-vowel word families reviews 
those features. In sorting words like mat and man, for example, students must focus on the 
final consonant more than any other phoneme. Nevertheless, the phonological awareness of 
the rime unit (e.g., -at,-an) lays the foundation for future vowel study as students begin to look 
inside the word for common features.
There is no particular order for studying word families, but a good choice is to start with 
short a families (at, an, ad, ap, ag) because these words abound in early reading materials, and 
students are likely to already know several words from these families by sight. In addition, 
short a is the least likely short vowel to be confused when students try to make matches based 
on letter names and place of articulation. Compare other same-vowel word families in a simi-
lar way (in, it, ip or ot, op, og, etc.).
Mixed-Vowel Word Families.  Move quickly to compare different vowel fami-
lies. The difference between top, tip and tap lies in the medial vowel, and it is through such 
contrasts that students are forced to listen to the vowel sound itself and look carefully at the 
vowel in the middle of a word. Students in the middle letter name stage should be ready to 
study mixed-vowel word families. Include words with blends and digraphs after they have been 
studied with picture sorts. For example, the ag family can be expanded to include flag, brag, 
drag, shag and snag.

Table 5.5 suggests contrasts and a sequence for studying 
word families under three possible pacing guides. However, 
it is just a suggestion for planning your own course of study. 
Consider the words that your students know as sight words, 
and the kinds of words they encounter in their reading. If 
you are reading a story with lots of short u words, then study 
a few short u families.
Introducing Same-Vowel Word Families with Pic-
tures.  Apply the following procedure when introducing a 
word family sort with pictures (see Figure 5.6).
1.	 Start with just the pictures for a rhyming sort. (See the 
list of rhyming short vowel pictures at the beginning of 
Appendix C.) Use pictures as headers for each column 
(e.g., can and dad) and then pick up another picture. Say to 
students, “Van. Does van rhyme with can or dad—van, can: 
van, dad? I will put it under the can.” Model several and 
then have students help you finish the sort. Name all the 
pictures in each column and talk about how they rhyme.
2.	 Now lay out the word cards. Name a header such as can 
and say, “Who can find the word can? What letters would 
you look for at the beginning and end?” Repeat for dad, 
and then ask students to find the word for each picture. ­
After all the words are sorted and matched to the pictures, read down each column. Ask 
the students how the words are alike; they should note that they all end with the same 
two letters. Explain that the words are in the same family (the an family or ad family) and 
they all rhyme.
3.	 Remove the words and shuffle them. Give them out to the students to match to the pic-
tures again. Read each column and then remove the pictures to see whether the students 
can use just the initial sound and the rime to read each word in the column.
4.	 Give students their own set of pictures and words to sort for seatwork. Follow up with 
other word family activities such as Build, Blend and Extend, described in Activity 5.22.
Introducing Mixed-Vowel Word Families with Words.  Word cards without pictures are used 
to compare mixed-vowels in word families such as ig, ag and og. Students should already know 
how to read several words in each family.
1.	 Begin by laying down a known word as a header for each family. Choose words you are 
sure the students can read, such as big, dog and bag. Explain that the rest of the words are 
to be sorted under one of these headers.
2.	 Pick up another word such as frog and say, “I am going to put this word under dog because 
it ends in o and g.” Then read the words: “Listen: dog, frog.” Continue to model one or 
two words in each category, always sorting first and then reading down, starting with the 
header.
3.	 Ask students to sort the next word. They should sort first and then read from the top of 
each column to help them identify the new word. They are not expected to sound out the 
word first and then sort. Instead, their sense of rhyme will support them as they read the 
new word, by simply changing the first sound of a word they already know. The final sort 
might look like the following:
big
dog
bag
dig
frog
wag
pig
hog
rag
wig
fog
flag
log
tag

with Pictures

191
4.	 After all of the words are sorted, read down each column and lead a discussion to focus 
students’ attention on the common features (sounds and letters): “How are the words in 
this column alike?” After giving students a chance to discuss what they notice about the 
words, summarise by explaining that the words in each column are in the same family 
because of the two ending letters and sounds that rhyme.
5.	 Provide students with individual sorts. Conclude as in the previous sort with follow-up 
activities.
Guidelines for Word Families.  As you study word families, keep these thoughts in mind.
• When studying word families, it is appropriate to modify one of the principles of word 
study described in Chapter 3, “Use words students can read.” When working with word 
families, students probably cannot read all the words initially. However, because the words 
are in rhyming families, students are supported with pictures and with headers that are 
familiar. Students sort visually by the rime spelling first, and then read unknown words 
by blending different onsets with the header rime.
• Include words with digraphs and blends once they are introduced. Studying the ack family can 
grow a lot when you include black, clack, track, shack, quack, stack, snack and crack.
• Supply supplemental reading materials that feature word families. With the publication of 
research about onsets and rimes, and renewed interest in word families, there has been 
a flood of reading materials for students that feature a particular family or short vowel. 
Some of these little books are engaging and well-written, offering students support in the 
form of patterned or rhyming text. Other books are contrived and nonsensical, as in “Nan 
and Dan sat in the pan”. Use well-written books as a starting point or as a follow-up for 
word study, and students can use the books to go on word hunts for additional words that 
follow the same phonics features. However, choose books carefully; text featuring sen-
tences such as “The tan man ran the van” make reading into an exercise in word calling 
rather than comprehension. Although some phonics readers are better than others, they 
shouldn’t constitute the sole reading materials used at this level.
• Plan follow-up activities. There are lots of activities and games to use when studying 
word families. Follow-ups to sorting include re-sorting, blind sorts and writing sorts, as 
described in Chapter 3. Board games designed to study beginning sounds can be adapted 
to word families. Activities like Build, Blend and Extend; Sound Wheels; Flip Charts; and 
Show Me are favourites and are included in this chapter’s activities. From this point on, 
expect students to spell the words they sort correctly; you can administer short spelling 
tests to assess their mastery and include dictated sentences that feature a family (e.g., “The 
frog sat on a log in the fog”). Use word study notebooks to record writing sorts and the 
results of word hunts or brainstorming sessions.
• Set a fast pace. Studying word families can take a long time if you feel compelled to study 
every family in a thorough fashion, but this should not be the case. See Table 5.5 for 
ideas about how to modify the pace. Although students may still make errors in spelling 
short vowels, many quickly pick up the notion that words that sound alike probably share 
similar rimes and are spelled alike. They will also be able to use this knowledge to figure 
out new words by analogy; for example, noting the and in stand, they quickly decode it.
The Study of Short Vowels in the CVC Pattern.  Once students are 
spelling about half of the short vowel words correctly on a spelling inventory and working 
with mixed-vowel word families easily and accurately, they are ready to study short vowels 
in nonrhyming words outside of word families. This asks them to look at words in a new 
way, not as two units with various rimes (m-ad, fl-ag, tr-ack), but as three units with the same 
CVC pattern (m-a-d, fl-a-g, tr-a-ck), one vowel surrounded by consonants. This ability to see 
words as patterns is the key feature of the next stage, the within word pattern stage. While 
studying short vowels, students come to see that CVC is the basic pattern for all short vowels 
across variations that include VC (e.g., at), CCVC (e.g., flat), CVCC (e.g., fast) and CCVCC 
(e.g., blast).

	 192	
CH AP TER 5
Word Sorting to Compare Two or More Short 
Vowels.  Use the following procedure for a teacher-
directed short vowel sort.
1.	 Make a collection of word cards that features 
two or more short vowels to model on a 
tabletop, pocket chart, overhead projector or 
document camera.
2.	 Begin by laying down a known word as a key 
word for each vowel. Read each word and iso-
late the vowel: “Here is the word cap. Listen: 
cap, ap, /ă/. Cap has the short a sound in the 
middle. Let’s listen for other words that have 
the same vowel sound in the middle.” Repeat 
for each category. See Figure 5.7.
3.	 Pick up a new word such as fast and say, “I am 
going to put this word under cap. Listen: ca-a-
ap, f-a-a-ast. They have the same vowel sound 
in the middle.” Continue to model one or 
two words in each category, reading each new 
word and comparing it to the key word. Hold 
up an oddball, like for or was. Ask students if 
they hear the same vowel sound in the middle. 
Model how to place it in the oddball category because it does not have the same vowel 
sound. Ask your students to help finish the sort. They should read each word and then 
sort it. Once the words are sorted, read down each column to check and discuss how the 
words are alike in sound and spelling. If students cannot read a word put it aside to revisit 
later. See Figure 5.7 for the final sort.
4.	 After all the words are sorted, read down each column to check and then discuss the common 
features: “How are the words in each column alike? How are the oddballs different? What 
is odd about them?” Help students identify the CVC pattern by labelling the units in cap, 
pig and hot. Point out that hill and trap are also CVC words because ll and tr are consonant 
units on each side of the single vowel. At this point revisit any unknown words. Ask the 
students to put each in the correct column and sound it out.
5.	 Reread the words in each column and then lead the students in sorting a second time. 
Leave mistakes to the end and check them by reading down the columns.
6.	 Give students their own set of words to sort at their seats, with partners or for  
homework.
7.	 Because it is easy to sort the words visually by attending to the vowel letters, the blind sort 
described in Chapter 3 is important as a follow-up activity. One partner reads each word 
aloud while the other partner indicates where it goes without seeing the word. Model this 
first in a small group and then let partners work together.
If students are still making some errors in the spelling of digraphs and blends, which 
is likely, include words with those features in the short vowel sorts. At this time, they have 
many more sight words that contain beginning and ending consonant digraphs and blends. 
You might even plan a two-way sort as shown in Figure 5.8—first by vowel sounds and 
second by digraphs or blends. This encourages flexibility in word analysis, a desirable trait 
(Sharp, Sinatra & Reynolds, 2008). Consider doing a third sort, perhaps sorting by action 
words (e.g., crash, drag, trim) versus things (e.g., crumb, truck, crib); take time to discuss words 
that could be used as both, depending on context (e.g., “We will trim the tree.”; “We added 
trim to the valentine.”). Cartwright (2006, 2008) argues that having students think about 
words by different attributes builds cognitive flexibility, an important component of reading 
comprehension. Discussing the different meanings and uses of words also makes students 
aware of the multiple meanings or polysemy of words, an important aspect of vocabulary 
development (Templeton et al., 2015).

Guidelines for Short Vowels.  As you study short vowels in CVC 
words, keep these points in mind:
• When studying short vowels, plan contrasts that are distinct 
from each other. We recommend that students first compare 
short a to short i or short o. Do not compare short a to short 
e, or short e to short i, until later as those are the very sounds 
students are most likely to confuse.
• You can sort most short vowels using with printed words, but 
you can also use pictures to focus students’ attention on the 
vowel sounds. Use pictures for column headers, such as the 
sound board for vowels in Appendix B; Appendix C contains 
pictures for sorting. Consider what words your students already 
know from familiar texts and word banks as you select words 
for sorts.
• This is a good time to establish the oddball, or miscellaneous cat-
egory, to accommodate variations in dialect and spelling. Some 
students may hear a short o in lost, but others will hear a sound 
closer to “aw”. Some students hear a different vowel in pin and 
pen, but others consider them homophones. Rather than forcing 
students to doubt their own ear, the oddball category offers an 
alternative and acknowledges that not everyone speaks the same 
way, nor does spelling always match pronunciation. Good words 
to use for oddballs in this stage are high-frequency words stu-
dents may already know as sight words, such as for, put, was and 
what. Was will be odd in a short a sort despite its CVC spelling 
because it doesn’t have the short a sound. Other oddballs have 
a short vowel sound but are spelled in unusual ways (e.g., laugh, 
head ). You can find examples in the word lists in Appendix E.
• Plan word hunts and other follow-ups. It is fairly easy to find 
words with short vowels in just about any beginning reading 
material because they are, by their nature, common in English. 
Encourage students to look for two-syllable words with a CVC 
syllable, such as funny or kitten.
• Pacing is important. Be prepared to spend some time on short 
vowels, as they pose special problems for young spellers and 
can persist as problems beyond first grade. Start with simple 
three-letter words that include many of the words studied in 
word families (e.g., bag, can, pat) but then move to more complex 
words with blends and digraphs at the beginning and end (e.g., 
brag, than, path). However, short vowels will be reviewed when 
they are compared to long vowels in the next stage, so do not 
expect complete mastery.
R-Influenced Vowels.  Words like car and for look as though 
they follow the CVC pattern, but they do not have the short sounds 
of a or o. Instead, the vowel sounds are subsumed by the r that follows 
and are known as r-influenced vowels (or r-controlled vowels). Do not 
expect students to segment a vowel sound separately from the r but 
instead teach ar and or as patterns or chunks. Because words spelled with ar and or are common 
in beginning reading materials, it is worthwhile to introduce them at the end of this stage. The 
r-influenced vowels form a major subcategory of vowels that will be examined more extensively 
during the next stage. Below is a sort that compares the r-influenced o sounds with short-o. Read 
down each column so you can hear the difference. What is odd about word and work? How are 
they different from the other r words? How are they similar to each other?

This chapter has presented examples of teacher-directed sorts or closed sorts—the 
teacher selects the words and leads a group sorting activity accompanied by a discussion of the 
features of interest. We recommend teacher-directed sorts when you introduce a new feature 
such as word families or short vowels. Offer clear explanations when introducing a new feature 
but gradually release responsibility to students who can sort independently as long as they can 
read the words as suggested in Table 3.1. Open sorts, as described in Chapter 3, ask students to 
establish their own categories and offer you diagnostic information that will help to determine 
how much students understand about the orthography.
Assess and Monitor Progress in  
the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage
It is critical that you monitor student progress in attaining a firm concept of word (COW) in 
text, and the fundamental phonics/spelling features that support the automatic recognition of 
a basic reading vocabulary, or sight words. Without these attaining these fundamentals, stu-
dents will not progress in reading. Assess students regularly to determine whether they need 
more practice or are ready to move on.
Assess and Monitor Progress in Concept of Word
Students in the letter name–alphabetic stage move from a rudimentary to a firm concept of 
word in text in the early part of this stage. Without a firm concept of word in text, students’ 
sight word development will be delayed. Chapter 4 presents a detailed assessment for moni-
toring COW; the same procedures are appropriate in this stage, with one addition. Not only 
should students be pointing accurately to words in familiar text without getting off track on 
two-syllable words, but they should also be acquiring some sight words. The ultimate litmus 
of a firm concept of word in text is a student’s ability to identify some words seen previously 
in context when shown in isolation, in a randomised list. So, to the assessment procedures 
we described in Chapter 4 we add a procedure for assessing word recognition in isolation.
Assess and Monitor Progress in Phonemic Awareness, Phonics 
and Spelling
Phonemic awareness, phonics and spelling are all highly related; therefore, frequent spelling 
assessments scored by features are an easy way to monitor student progress. You can adminis-
ter the spelling feature inventories described in Chapter 2 several times a year to track prog-
ress. As shown in Table 5.6, Zack began the year as an early letter name speller, often omitting 
vowels and blends, which suggested that his phonemic awareness was only partial. By January, 
he was in the middle letter name stage, including a vowel in each word and spelling many 
vowels, blends and digraphs correctly. He had full phonemic awareness, fully segmenting each 
word into sounds. By May, his correct spelling of short vowels as well as his use of silent e 
showed that he was transitioning into the within word pattern stage. Zack made solid progress 
over the course of the year in phonemic awareness, phonics and spelling.
Ongoing assessment can be as simple as observing how quickly and accurately students 
sort pictures, or you can have students paste the pictures they have sorted into categories and

label them. Weekly assessment in the middle to late part of this stage may involve a brief spell-
ing test of five to ten words. In addition, we provide a series of spell checks on the PDToolkit 
for letter name–alphabetic spellers. We recommend that you use these as a pretest before 
introducing a feature, and after spending a few weeks or so on a feature you can use them as 
a post-test. Progress monitoring or goal-setting forms are also available.
Assess and Monitor Progress in Sight Word Development
Once students achieve a firm concept of word in text, they should remember some words 
that they have seen in context, out of context. While students cannot be expected to remem-
ber all of the words they have read in context, they should be able “pick up” a handful of 
words after several readings to add to their sight vocabularies. Frequently assessing students’ 
word recognition in isolation should provide the feedback you need to determine whether or 
not to back up or move forward in reading levels, spelling features or instructional support. 
If students are not progressing, make sure they receive texts that they can read successfully.
The easiest way to monitor progress in sight word development is to keep track of the 
number of known words in students’ word banks. The number of known words, or sight 
words, should grow steadily across the early mid to late letter name–alphabetic phase when 
students are given regular opportunities to select and review words out of context that they 
have read in context. You will know that a student is developing a solid sight word vocabulary 
when his or her word bank exceeds 200 known words.
You can also note progress in sight word development as students are able to read increas-
ingly difficult levels of reading materials with less support in the form of shared reading. By the 
middle to late letter name–alphabetic stage, less predictable reading materials require young 
readers to carefully focus on print and rely more on word recognition and less on memory of the 
language. Use running records to monitor word recognition accuracy in context (Clay, 2009).

You should constantly assess and adjust your instruction to match the individual needs of 
your students. The responsibility is on us as teachers to make sure our students are progress-
ing. We are the first responders!
Word Study with English Learners  
in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage
In general, most other languages do not have as many single consonants or blends as we do 
in English. English learners may need more time to master these sounds because they will 
have to learn how to hear and pronounce the sounds, segment the sounds and learn the let-
ter correspondences. In Table 5.7 you can see the sounds that English learners may omit or 
mispronounce.
for English Learners
	 Table 5.7    Consonant Confusions for English Learners
Sound
Potential Confusion
b
The voiced b is confused with the unvoiced p and is difficult in final position.
c
Is often confused with hard g. Many languages do not have a hard c.
d
Is confused with /th/ in Spanish, so dog may be pronounced /thŏg/.
f
Is confused with v, especially in Arabic. In Japanese it is confused with /h/.
g
The hard g sound may be confused with k by speakers of Arabic, French or Swahili.
h
Is silent in Spanish and in Chinese it sounds more like /kh/ as in loch.
j
May be confused with h in Spanish and may also be pronounced /ch/.
k
May be confused with hard g by Spanish speakers.
l
May be confused with r. Final l may be especially difficult.
m
May be dropped at the ends of words.
n
Is difficult for speakers of Chinese, especially at the ends of words. May be confused with l.
p
Is easily confused with its voiced mate b.
r
Is rolled in Spanish and may be spelled with w. It is confused with l in many Asian languages.
s
Is difficult to perceive in final position.
sh
Is a sound that does not exist in many languages and is confused with ch, g and j.
s-blends
Blends in Spanish such as st, sk and sp are separate syllables that begin with e as in es-pañol.
t
Is confused with the voiced sound of d by Spanish speakers and not pronounced at the ends of words.
v
May be confused with b in Spanish and Korean. It does not exist in many languages.
w
Is a letter that does not exist in many languages and may be confused with v.
y
May sound more like /ch/ in Spanish.
z
May be confused with s and not voiced in Spanish.

	
Word Study for Beginners in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage	
197
For example, Spanish-speaking students may confuse words that begin with d and th, 
pronouncing dog with a th sound, more like “thog”. Jump may be pronounced “chump”. It 
is important to create sorts that make these comparisons clear (d and th or j and ch) once 
the other beginning sounds are established. Refer to Words Their Way® with English Learners, 
Words Their Way®: Emergent Sorts for Spanish-Speaking English Learners and Words Their Way®: 
Letter Name–Alphabetic Sorts for Spanish-Speaking English Learners (Helman et al., 2012) for 
additional sorts to help students learn these distinctions.
Only a handful of consonants occur in the final position in Spanish (d, n, l, r, s, z), so it is 
common for English learners to omit the ending consonant sounds in words like hard, which 
may be spelled HAR. Final consonant picture sorts may be needed to bring attention to these 
sounds. Sorting words by rhyme or word families like bag, rag, tag can also be more of a chal-
lenge for English learners. Contrasts in which the vowel and the final consonant differ (at, 
op, un) are a better starting place. In Spanish, the s-blends work differently. In many Spanish 
words, the sp blend is split between two syllables. The s is given a vowel (es) and p starts the 
second syllable, as in Es-pañol.
Still, there are many consonants shared by Spanish and English (b, d, f, g, k, l, m, n, p, r, 
s, t, w, y), and Spanish-speaking students can begin studying consonants with these. Spanish 
picture sorts can be found in the toolkit for Words Their Way for English Learners (Helman 
et al., 2012) under both the Emergent and Letter Name categories and in Palabras a Su Paso: 
El Estudio de Palabras en Acción (Pearson Schools, 2013). Explain the different sounds in English 
and Spanish, and acknowledge students’ confusion as logical. Because students might not be 
able to name the pictures, you might pair them with an English-speaking partner who can 
supply the English names.
As with consonants, other languages do not have as many vowel sounds as we do in Eng-
lish. Spanish has only one short vowel sound (short o), and it is spelled with the letter a as in 
gracias. Expect students to substitute vowels in their own language that are close in point of 
articulation for these short English vowels when they say and spell English words. Short e may 
be pronounced like the long a (pet as PAIT), short i like the long e (tip as TEEP) and short a 
and short u like the short o (cat and cut as cot) (Helman et al., 2012). See Chapter 6 for more 
information about vowel confusions for students learning English.
Word Study Routines and Management
The letter name–alphabetic stage easily spans kindergarten through second grade. A handful 
of students in third grade and even a few students in the upper elementary grades will still 
need to work on the features that characterise this stage. English learners of any age can be in 
this stage. It may be tempting to rush through, but word study in the letter name–alphabetic 
stage helps to build a solid foundation for the study of long vowels and other vowel patterns 
in the next stage.
A balanced literacy programme includes Read To, Read With, Write With, Word 
Study and Talk With activities (RRWWT). During read to time, teachers read aloud litera-
ture that offers exposure to new vocabulary and literary language. During read with time, 
students meet in large groups for shared reading and small groups for instructional-level 
reading. Teachers model how to compose ideas and spell words as they write with students, 
who, in turn, write for themselves. Word study includes direct instruction in letter–sound 
correspondences, phonics and spelling patterns. Finally, a comprehensive programme pro-
vides students with ample opportunities to talk with teachers and peers about the books 
and experiences they have shared. Whole-group read-alouds continue to be the best place 
to focus on vocabulary, but you should look for other opportunities throughout the day to 
highlight new vocabulary words. Concept sorts can be developed for science, social studies 
and math.
To differentiate instruction, you need small groups. In first-grade classrooms, teach-
ers like Mr. Perez often find that reading groups and word study groups are virtually the 

	 198	
CH AP TER 5
same. Word sorts can be introduced as part of the reading group. Students practice the 
sorts for ­seatwork and in centres with partners or individually once they learn the rou-
tines. Other teachers have a separate word study time, meeting with small groups initially 
to introduce a sort, but then expecting follow-up routines to be done independently or 
with partners.
Word study during the letter name–alphabetic stage begins with picture sorts for ini-
tial sounds, and ends with word sorts for short vowels in nonrhyming words. During this 
transition, there are various routines and generic activities to help students explore study 
features in depth (see Chapter 3). Betty Lee’s schedule is particularly appropriate in the 
early letter name–alphabetic stage for students who are doing picture sorts and keeping 
their materials in two-pocket folders. Later in the stage when students are sorting words, 
other routines that involve writing sorts in word study notebooks are more effective. 
Table 5.8 summarises routines for this stage. Games and activities are described in detail 
in the section that follows.
Pacing is important. There are many blends and many word families, and if every 
one were studied for a week, it could take many months. You might want to create two- 
or three-day cycles. For example, you might introduce two word families on Monday, 
another two on Wednesday, and then combine them for several days. Be ready to pick 
up the pace by combining a number of blends or families into one sort (up to four or 
five) or by omitting some features. The progress monitoring assessments provided on the 
PDToolkit help you to know what students can do. Ultimately, your own observations 
dictate the pace that is appropriate for your students. Table 5.5 offers three pacing guides 
that you may use to identify shortcuts for achieving students or more in-depth study for 
struggling students.

In this section, specific activities for students in the letter name–alphabetic stage are organised 
into the following categories:
1.	Vocabulary activities
2.	Phonemic awareness activities
3.	Development and use of personal readers and word banks
4.	Dictionary
5.	Study of initial consonant sounds
6.	Study of word families
7.	Study of short vowels
Some of the games and activities are adaptable, using a variety of features at different stages. 
These are indicated by the Adaptable for Other Stages icon. Common Core State Standards 
for Foundational Skills and Language are listed for kindergarten and first grade.
Vocabulary Activities
These activities are designed to help students develop their oral vocabularies. The vocabulary 
activities in Chapter 4 are also relevant here (Activities 4.1 to 4.7).
	 5.1 	 Anchored Vocabulary Instruction
Printing words on cards that are the focus of vocabulary instruction during a read-aloud is a 
way to anchor the meaning of the word to its sounds and spelling (Juel et al., 2003). These 
vocabulary cards will also serve as a reminder to review the words over time and in different 
contexts. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K–1st) 3, Language (K–1st) 5, 6)
Resources for Implementing 
Word Study in Your Classroom
Several sources are available to help you implement 
word study with students in the letter name–alphabetic 
stage.
1.	 The pictures in Appendix C and word lists in Appen-
dix E, as well as suggested sorts in Appendix D, are 
available for use with the templates in Appendix F to 
create your own picture sorts.
2.	 Prepared sorts, spell checks and games are available 
on the PDToolkit for Words Their Way. A Create Your 
Own feature allows you to create your own sorts. 
You can also print game board templates and use 
the words or images from your sorts with the games. 
Look for “List of Available Images for Create Your 
Own” under the Additional Resources tab to find 
what pictures can be selected.

CH AP TER 5
Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
Materials  Children’s books to read aloud and a supply of 2-by-6-inch (or larger) cards. 
Print words neatly with markers.
Procedures
1.	Preview a book that you plan to read aloud and select a few words whose meanings may 
not be known to all of your students. Focus on words that are important to the meaning 
of the story but are also words that are likely to come up again in other stories. Juel et al. 
(2003) provide the examples of pond, mill and haystack from Rosie’s Walk (by P. Hutchins) 
as words urban children would probably not know. Write the words you select on cards 
in neat block letters.
2.	Before reading the story, introduce the words. You might begin by asking students if they 
can supply a definition and then back that up with your own. At times you might model 
using a picture dictionary to look up the meaning of a word. If a concrete word like hay-
stack is in the story, show a picture of a haystack. You can supply your own picture, photo 
or bring in concrete objects. Even a quick sketch can help and might be added to the 
card. Always try to use “kid-friendly” definitions with accessible language. For example, a 
new word like community may be defined as a “neighbourhood” or vacant as “empty.” As 
students develop decoding skills, you might begin by asking them to figure a word out 
before telling them. Students in the late letter name stage, for example, would probably 
be able to read mill or pond but might not know exactly what they are.
3.	To help anchor the word in memory, point to the word as you say it slowly, stretching 
out the sounds as you touch the letters and then have the students repeat it with you. You 
might point out the beginning or ending sound, the length and number of phonemes or 
syllables or other letter–sound characteristics of the word, depending on what your stu-
dents might need. For example, students whose home language is Spanish might have a 
hard time with double ls at the end of a word like mill, because that combination (ll) has 
a different letter–sound correspondence in Spanish. You could point out the double ls in 
mill and have the students say it with you, emphasising the final sound. Students are not 
expected to learn these as reading vocabulary, but Juel’s research shows that seeing the 
words can help students remember them as meaning vocabulary.
4.	When you come to the word during the read-aloud, hold up the card and briefly draw 
attention to it to remind students of its meaning and letter–sound properties. Ask some-
one to point to the word on the book page.
5.	After reading, go through the word cards once more and ask students to say each word, 
define it and perhaps use the word in a sentence that also recalls events in the story. For 
example, you might hold up pond and say, “Who can tell me where the fox got all wet? Yes, 
he fell in the pond.” Ask questions that use the words, such as “Would you rather land in 
a pond or in a haystack? Tell me why.”
6.	Add new word cards to a growing set to be reviewed over time. Keep them handy to 
pull out when you have a few minutes to spare and go through them. It is this continued 
exposure that will assure that the words are retained over time. If students use the words 
or notice the anchored words in new contexts, make it a cause for great celebration. You 
can be deliberate in selecting new read-alouds with these same words, such as The Little 
Red Hen, in which the hen takes grain to the mill, or The Small Small Pond by Denise 
Fleming.
	 5.2 	 Think-Pair-Share
In Chapter 4, we described “turn and talk” (Activity 4.3 in Chapter 4) as a way to give more 
students the opportunity to engage in oral language and use new vocabulary. Instead of call-
ing on one student to talk, all students are asked to talk with a partner. “Turn and talk” can 
be used with all ages but think-pair-share is a variation that provides more “think time” and 
ends with the opportunity to share ideas in the larger group. Both activities give less verbal 
children and English learners a chance to articulate their ideas in a less threatening situation. 
(CCSS Language (K–1st) 5, 6)

	
Word Study for Beginners in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage	
201
Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
Procedures
1.	Think. During a read-aloud or discussion, instead of raising hands to answer questions, 
make predictions, share experiences, define words or use words in sentences, ask students 
to think of their own response for a few moments.
2.	Pair. Students then turn and talk to a partner or discuss in small groups. You can assign partners 
or groups in advance and have them stay together for a week or more. Students can also count 
off to form groups. Observe the pairs or groups to make sure all students are participating.
3.	Share. After everyone has had a chance to talk, call on individuals or groups to report back 
to the larger group. By listening in on the groups, you might identify ideas or examples 
that seem particularly worthwhile.
	 5.3 	 Books and Concept Sorts
Books make great beginnings for concept sorts. As an example to get you started, Gregory the 
­Terrible Eater by Marjorie Sharmat tells the story of a young goat who wants to eat real food while 
his parents constantly urge him to eat “junk food”. In this case, the goats’ favourite foods really are 
junk from the local dump: tyres, tin cans, old rags and so on. (CCSS Language (K–1st) 5, 5.a, 6)
Materials  You will need a copy of the book to read aloud. Collect real objects or pic-
tures of items suggested by the story; for example, fruits, vegetables, newspaper, shoelaces, 
spaghetti and pieces of clothing.
Procedures
1.	After enjoying this story together, introduce the students to a concept sort. Gather the 
students on the rug around a large table or pocket chart, and challenge them to group 
the items by the things Gregory likes and the things he dislikes. Encourage them to talk 
about the items in complete sentences such as, “Carrots are real food that Gregory likes.”
2.	After deciding where everything should go, ask the students to describe how the things 
in that category are alike. Decide on a key word or descriptive phrase that will label each 
category. Real food and junk food are obvious choices, but your students might be more 
inventive. As you print the selected key words on cards, model writing for the students. 
Say each word slowly and talk about the sounds you hear in the words and the letters you 
need to spell them. You might give all of the students in the group a card and ask them to 
label one of the individual items using invented spelling.
3.	Plan time for individual sorting. Keep the items and key word cards available so that stu-
dents will be free to redo the sort on their own or with a partner at another time, perhaps 
during free time or centre time. Encourage them to talk as they sort.
4.	Follow the sorting with draw-and-label or cut-and-paste activities. This may be done as 
a group activity, in which case a section of a bulletin board or a large sheet of paper is 
divided into two sections and labelled with the key words. If students work independently, 
give each student a sheet of paper folded into two sections. Ask the students to draw items, 
or give them a collection of magazines or catalogues to search for pictures to cut out and 
paste into the correct category (seed catalogues are great for fruits and vegetables). Again, 
encourage students use invented spelling to label the pictures.
Extensions  Gregory the Terrible Eater serves as an excellent introduction to studying 
healthy eating. The same pictures the students have drawn or cut out can serve as the begin-
ning pictures for categories such as meats, grains, fruits and vegetables and dairy products.
Variations  Other books can also be used as the starting point for concept sorts of many 
kinds, as in the following:
• Noisy Nora by Rosemary Wells. Sort pictures that suggest noisy activities or objects with 
pictures that suggest quiet activities or objects.
• Town Mouse, Country Mouse by Jan Brett and various authors. Sort pictures of things you 
would see in the country and things you would see in the city.

	 202	
CH AP TER 5
Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
• Alexander and the Wind-Up Mouse by Leo Lionni. Sort pictures of real animals and toys 
or imaginary animals.
• Amos and Boris by William Steig. Sort pictures of things that Amos would see on the land 
and things that Boris would see in the ocean.
	 5.4 	 Thematic Unit on Animals as a Starting Point  
for Concept Sorts
Teachers of young students often organise their curriculum into thematic units of study. Such 
units frequently lend themselves to concept sorts, which review and extend the understandings 
central to the goals of the unit. Studying animals particularly lends itself to concept sorts and 
can be used as a way of introducing a unit. (CCSS Language (K–1st) 5, 5.a, 5.b, 6)
Materials  Plastic animals or animal pictures.
Procedures  Lay out the collection of animals and ask students to think of ways that they 
can be grouped together. Such an open sort will result in many different categories based on 
attributes of colour, number of legs, fur or feather coat and so on. A lively discussion will arise 
as students discover that some animals can go in unexpected categories.
The direction you eventually want this activity to go depends on the unit goal. If you are 
studying animal habitats, then you will eventually guide the students to sorting the animals by 
the places they live. If you are studying classes of animals, then the students must eventually 
learn to sort them into mammals, fish, amphibians and birds. If you are focusing on the food 
chain, your categories may be carnivores, herbivores and omnivores.
	 5.5 	 Creative Dramatics
Creative dramatics is a way to encourage students’ self-expression as well as vocabulary devel-
opment (Honig & Shin, 2001; Mages, 2008; Lobo & Winsler, 2006). Students enjoy reciting 
what they hear and appreciate the rhythm of language as they act out memorable scenes from 
familiar stories. In creative dramatics, props are not necessary but add to the fun. For example, 
after hearing the story Caps for Sale (by E. Slobodkina) students walk around the room singing, 
“Caps for sale, caps for sale. Red and white and blue and green. The finest caps you’ve ever 
seen.” Students can also act out the part of the story when the monkeys steal the caps from 
the peddler after he falls asleep under a tree and then mimic the peddler with “Chi, chi, chi, 
chi.” (CCSS Language (K) 1, 1.f, 5.d, 6, (1st) 1, 1.j, 5, 6)
Materials  Many picture books can work, as well as classic folk tales. There are a number 
of anthologies to consider including:

CA: Libraries Unlimited.

Procedures
1.	After they listen to a story, ask students to select a character and think about how that 
particular character acts, like crawling on all fours and roaring like a lion as in Leo the Lion 
or stirring a pot of food after hearing a version of Stone Soup.
2.	Reread a short scene and have three or four students act out the scene with its move-
ment and a few of its lines. Props are not typically used, and everyone is given a chance 
to participate.

3.	Ask the students who were watching to comment on what they 
liked and how they might improve the next time.
4.	Have another three or four students try the same scene.
Extensions  Prepare copies of key lines from the scene in 
26-point text that students place in their personal readers to reread, 
as in Figure 5.9. Note in the figure how Kari has underlined words 
for her word bank and also how she has recorded her rereadings 
with tick marks. Have students draw pictures of the scene they 
dramatised and bring the stories they have written to the group to 
dramatise a scene.
	 5.6 	 Acting Out Meanings
Young children love any type of movement activity. As they encoun-
ter new words through read-alouds and your use of sophisticated 
words (see page 175), take advantage of opportunities to act out 
words so your students can develop understanding. (CCSS Lan-
guage (K) 1, 1.f, 5.d, 6, (1st) 1, 1.j, 5, 5.d, 6)
Materials  Any children’s picture book can work, but choose a picture book that lends 
itself to action. Morales’ Niño Wrestles the World or Knutson’s Love and Roast Chicken are two 
excellent examples.
Procedures
1.	After reading Love and Roast Chicken: A Trickster Tale from the Andes Mountains (Knutson) 
aloud, discuss the meaning of the word scurried. You might demonstrate the terms scurry, 
scramble, dash or hustle.
2.	Invite the students to do these actions. In so doing, you are supporting their developing 
awareness of the shades of meaning, or nuances, among these words. Common verbs such 
as march, stroll or walk are good starting points because they are the easiest for students 
to distinguish.
Extensions
1.	Try acting out adjectives, which are just a bit more challenging. Begin with frequently 
occurring ones like happy, sad, tiny, and enormous and invite students to demonstrate them 
through facial expressions and body movement. This is particularly effective with English 
learners.
2.	Explore antonyms in the same way. Begin by sharing concept books such as Eric Carle’s 
Opposites or Tana Hoban’s Exactly the Opposite, both of which feature colourful illustrations. 
Then engage students in acting out antonyms as they follow along with your discussion 
and modelling. You might play “Simon Says” using directives such as, “Simon says walk 
fast. Simon says walk slow. Simon says put your hand over your head. Simon says put your 
hand under your chin.”  Other action-filled multicultural choices might include:

Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
Phonemic Awareness
Phonemic awareness continues to develop from partial to full across the letter name–
alphabetic stage. Students’ developing awareness is exercised by sorting pictures and words 
for sounds—first for single consonants, then for blends, followed by onset and rime in 
word families, and finally all the sounds in short vowel sorts. Routines such as interactive 
writing and morning message, described in Activities 4.39 and 4.40 in Chapter 4, should 
continue in this stage, providing you with the opportunity to model phonemic segmenta-
tion as you stretch out the sounds in words to write. Students will get this same practice as 
they write with invented spelling for many different purposes. For this reason we do not 
suggest many separate phonemic awareness activities here. However, students who need 
extra help developing full phonemic awareness will benefit from the following activity 
using sound boxes.
	 5.7 	 Beginning-Middle-End: Find Phonemes in Sound Boxes
Originally developed by Elkonin (1973), sound boxes serve as a 
concrete way to demonstrate how words are made of smaller pieces 
of sound. The following variation is a song the teacher and children 
sing as they try to find the location of each sound in the word. 
(CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.d, (1st) 2.c, 2.d)
Materials  You will need large letter cards and a three-pocket 
holder, such as the one shown in Figure 5.10.
Procedures
1.	Place the letters needed to spell a three-letter word in the 
pocket backwards so the children cannot see the letters. 
Announce a CVC word, such as sun. Choose words from a 
familiar book, poem or dictation when possible. Words that 
start with continuant sounds such as /m/, /s/ or /f/ work well 
because they can be said slowly.
2.	Sing the song to the tune of “Are You Sleeping, Brother John?”
Beginning, middle, end; beginning, middle, end.
Where is the sound? Where is the sound?
Where’s the ssss in sun?Where’s the ssss in sun?
Let’s find out. Let’s find out.
3.	Children take turns coming forward to pick the position and check by turning the letter 
card.
	 5.8 	 Push It Say It
This activity is a good way to teach students how to blend sounds as they move letter tiles 
or little cards around, as shown in Figure 5.11. Throughout the letter name stage, students 
learn to manipulate the sounds in words by exchanging one letter for another to make a 
new word. This skill will eventually help them sound out or decode unfamiliar words as 
they read by blending sounds and word parts together. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.c, 
2.d, (1st) 2.b, 2.c, 2.d)
Materials  You will need a large set of tiles or cards containing the letters of the alpha-
bet, the consonant digraphs and rimes for word families (such as at, ill, ock) for modelling and 
smaller sets so students can work along with you. Model with the cards on a desktop with a 
small group or prepare magnetised cards to use on a board.
Figure 5.10  Sound Boxes

	
Word Study for Beginners in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage	
205
Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
Procedures
1.	Choose the rime card that matches the sort you are about to do or the features from a 
previous sort that need reviewing. If you are working with the at and an families, cut out 
these rime cards as well as an assortment of beginning 
sounds such as f, m and r. Two or three rime cards 
and two or three consonant cards are enough for one 
lesson. Continuant consonants such as f, m and r are 
easier to elongate than the stop consonants (b, t, g) so 
start with these. Students will need practice with all 
the consonants eventually.
2.	First, identify the rimes as the at or an family, and 
have your students repeat them after you. Next, push 
a beginning letter such as the f card up while saying 
“f-f-f-f ”. Then, push the an card up while saying “an”. 
Say the word fan as you push the cards together, as 
shown in Figure 5.11.
3.	Tell your students that you can take the an away and change the word to fat. Push the f 
card up a little further while saying “f-f-f-f ”. then push the at card up next to it while say-
ing “at”. Then say fat as you push them together.
4.	After modelling this procedure, ask your students to push and say fan with their own cards. 
Ask them how they might change fan into fat. Repeat with one or two other beginning 
sounds to change fan into man, man into ran, and ran into rat and so on.
Extensions
1.	Add consonant blends and digraphs as they are studied. Note that digraphs such as sh, 
are written on one card (not separated into a s card and an h card), while blends should be 
on separate cards. Follow the same procedures above, using the digraphs and blends and 
exchanging different-vowel rimes. Model how to change ship into shop, shop into chop, chop 
into chip, using digraphs or top into stop into slop using blends.
2.	The “Push It Say It” routine for medial vowel, CVC words is slightly different for the 
non-rhyming words because you will use a separate vowel card and push three or four 
cards. Change pat to pet, pet to pit, pit to pot, pot to hot, hot to hit and son on.
Development and Use of Personal Readers and 
Word Banks
Personal readers are collections of dictations and other short pieces of text that serve many 
purposes, helping students develop a concept of word and concepts about print as well as a 
sight vocabulary. Word banks take words out of context for close study and enhance sight 
word learning.
	 5.9 	 Collecting Individual Dictations and  
Group Experience Stories
Recording students’ individual or group dictations as they talk about personal or group experi-
ences is a key feature of the language experience approach, or LEA (Stauffer, 1980). The text 
created makes especially good reading material for beginning readers because it is inherently 
familiar and easy to remember. It is ideal to have every student in a group contribute a sen-
tence, but dictations need to be kept to a reasonable length to be sure beginning readers can 
read them back. This activity is described on page 141. Here we offer a description of using 
group dictations across a four-day sequence to collect words for a word bank. This can be 
Figure 5.11  Push It Say It

accomplished in fewer days with smaller groups. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 1, 1.a, 1.b, 
1.c, 1.d, 3.a, 3.c, 4, (1st) 1, 1.a, 3, 3.g, Language (K) 1.f, (1st) 1.j)
Materials  You will need chart paper, an overhead projector, a computer or another way 
to record dictation so that students can observe you write. You will also need to make copies 
of the dictation for each student. See the section above on page 185 for further directions in 
how to develop and use personal readers.
Procedures
Day 1.  Share an experience and collect dictations, as described in Chapter 4. When it is 
complete, read the entire dictation as you point to the words. Then have students repeat after 
you, sentence by sentence using echo reading, as you point to each word. Reread it again as 
the students read along with you in a choral reading fashion.
Before day 2, make a copy of the dictation for each student in the group. Comput-
ers make it easy to create these copies. Select a font that has the type of letters easily 
recognised by young readers (Geneva or Comic Sans MS work well) and enlarge it as 
much as possible. It is also easy to make copies by writing neatly in your best manuscript 
handwriting.
Day 2.  Reread dictations and underline known words.
1.	Choral read the original dictation and then again as students follow along on their own 
copies, pointing to words as they read. Call on individual students to read a sentence.
2.	Once students can read the dictation successfully, ask them to underline known words to 
harvest for their word bank, as described in Activity 5.11. Point to the underlined words 
randomly to make sure they know the words they underline. Students might make an 
illustration to go with the dictation.
Day 3.  Choral read and harvest known words.
Students can work together or individually to read the dictation again. Make word cards for 
underlined words that are recognised accurately and quickly.
Day 4 and On.  Choral read and review new word cards.
1.	Have students continue to reread their dictations, review the words in their word banks 
and complete their pictures.
2.	Start a new dictation or story cycle when students can read the previous dictation with 
good accuracy and modest fluency.
3.	Include personal readers in reading intervention plans. We like to see students using 
their personal readers in targeted interventions with the literacy specialist and Title 
I teachers. Students have additional opportunities to reread their entries to promote 
fluency, for phonics instruction and the development of a sight vocabulary. Make an 
extra copy of the entries, share digital copies and have the personal readers accessible 
to students when they meet with their teachers. Students also take the personal readers 
home, or access their personal readers online where they reread the stories, review their 
word banks and sort words and pictures (Bear et al., 2004; Johnston, Invernizzi, Juel & 
Lewis-Wagner, 2009).
Extensions
1.	Bilingual entries in the personal readers are particularly useful during the early part of 
the letter name–alphabetic stage (Helman et al., 2012). These bilingual stories are written 
in both the first and second languages. Initially, dictations are just one or two sentences 
long. A school aide or parent can help with the translations. Shari Dunn and her students 
developed bilingual class readers that included students’ individual pages about pets and 
other themes, like weather and health.
2.	Develop digital personal readers that include digital photographs to accompany the stu-
dents’ dictations.
for English Learners

Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
3.	Incorporate software into the dictation process. Use voice recognition, drawing and 
animation software in the dictation process to help students create their own language 
experience stories (Labbo, Eakle & Montero, 2002).
4.	Extend your language experience dictations into student-generated writing by using an 
author’s computer chair (Labbo, 2004).
	5.10 	 Support Reading with Rhymes and Pattern Stories
Rhymes and jingles and predictable patterned texts make good reading materials because they 
provide support for beginning readers and can then be used to harvest known words for word 
banks. (See Activity 4.39 in Chapter 4 for a complete guide to the whole-to-part lesson plan 
and supporting activities.)
Materials  Find a rhyme, jingle, song or predictable story that students will find 
memorable and readable. You can focus on one major pattern or verse, such as the refrain in 
The Gingerbread Man. Find a big book, make a chart or project a copy of the text electroni-
cally for group work and make copies of the rhymes and patterns for students’ personal  
readers.
Procedures
Day 1.  Introduce and read the text.
1.	Talk about the title and cover and look at the pictures (if applicable) with the students.
2.	Read the rhyme or story while fingerpointing the text. Read fluently and with expression, 
but not too fast. Stop periodically to discuss and enjoy the story.
3.	Reread the text and invite students to choral or echo read the entire text if it is short; or 
read parts of the text.
4.	Decide which parts of the text will be compiled for personal readers. Type the text onto a 
single page that can be duplicated for each student. Number and date this entry.
Days 2, 3 and 4.  Reread the rhyme or story and harvest words for word banks as described 
in Activity 5.11. Use the same procedures described in Activity 5.9 for dictations as follow-ups 
for rhymes and predictable text. Write sentences from the text can on sentence strips, and have 
students work to rebuild the text in a pocket chart as described in Activities 4.40 and 4.41 in 
Chapter 4. In Figure 5.9, you see a sample of a rhyme adapted from the story Caps for Sale 
(by E. Slobodkina). Kari has underlined a number of words to harvest for her word bank. In 
addition, Kari has made a tick mark each time she reread the rhyme.
	5.11 	 Harvesting Words for Word Banks
Students need to have a stock of sight words that they can read with ease. These can be 
harvested from books, familiar rhymes or dictations, and stored in a word bank to be 
reviewed over time. Although word bank words are traditionally chosen by the students, 
you can encourage young readers to include high-frequency words (will, this, want) that they 
need to learn, or words containing the spelling features being examined during word study. 
Favourite words are those that interest the reader (dinosaur, chocolate, birthday); these longer 
concrete nouns may be more memorable to the student than the high-frequency words! The 
following activities help students develop and maintain a word bank. (CCSS Foundational 
Skills (K) 3.c, 3.d, (1st) 3.g)
Materials  You will need copies of personal readers, dictations, familiar books and so 
on. Prepare a collection of blank word cards. Tagboard and index cards can be cut to a size 
that is large enough to hold easily, yet small enough so that students can work with them on 
a desktop when sorting (4 by 1.5 inches is about right). You can also create a sheet of words 
for a particular story or poem read by a group of students. Reproduce and cut apart the sheets 
and the words, which you can hand out as students identify them.

	 208	
CH AP TER 5
Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
Have students store their words in envelopes, plastic bags, small margarine containers or 
small gift bags. Plastic and metal index card file boxes work well—words can be sorted with 
dividers. You can start with plastic bags for the first 50 words and then move to a box.
Procedures  Harvesting words may vary depending on the sources:
1.	From personal readers.  If students have an individual copy of dictations, jingles, parts  
of stories and so on, simply ask them to underline the words they know. Many students 
will be tempted to underline every word, but over time they will begin to understand 
the procedure and realise they need to be selective and underline only words they really 
know. Suggesting that they scan through the text backwards can help some students find 
known words more accurately. You, your assistant or a classroom volunteer can point to 
the underlined words in a random fashion to check whether the student can indeed name 
the word quickly (without rereading the sentence in which it occurs). Write known words 
on word cards. Writing the word for the student will ensure that it is neat and accurate. 
Ask the student to spell it aloud as you or another adult writes, to focus their attention 
on all the letters. On each card write the number of the page in the personal reader. This 
makes it possible for students to go back and use context clues to name the word if they 
forget it. Then ask students to write their initials on the back of each card in case words 
get mixed up during word bank activities.
2.	From familiar books.  Students can also collect sight words independently from books  
they have read. Select words from the book that seem useful or interesting, write them on 
cards and store them in a library pocket in the back of the book. After reading the text, 
teach students to read through the words in the pocket to see which ones they know at 
sight. Have students write the words they know onto their own cards and place them in 
their word banks. They can match unknown words back to their counterparts in the text.
3.	From any text.  The easiest procedure for harvesting words is to simply ask the students  
to point to words in a book or from a chart that they would like to put in their word bank. 
After several words are written on cards, you or a helper can hold up the words to check 
for recognition.
TIPS  To ensure that unknown words do not enter students’ word banks, develop a short-
term word bank for words that students recognise from the latest stories and dictations stored 
inside their personal readers (see Figure 5.4). Periodically, work with students in small groups 
to have them read through the words in their short-term word banks. Words they know from 
memory go into the permanent word bank.
Create a group word bank to use instead of or in addition to individual word banks. The 
group agrees on the words to add (with some gentle prodding by you to add high-frequency 
words that will show up in other stories) and the words can be reviewed in the group. Also 
make them available for individuals or partners to use in the word bank activities described in 
Activities 5.12–5.13.
	5.12 	 The Grand Sort with Word Bank Words
Have students review the word bank regularly as an important way to secure those words in 
memory as sight words. In this sort, students simply go through their word cards, say the words 
they know and put them in one pile and place the unknown words to the side. Have students try 
to move quickly reading through the pile. The words students put in the “I know” pile are words 
you and they can use in other sorts. Reading through their words banks is a common activity 
with your supervision in circle time, with a partner or classroom volunteer, or independently.
You can discard the unknown words, but this can be a touchy point for some students 
who are hesitant to throw away words. There is no harm in letting a few temporarily unknown 
words remain, but working with a lot of unknown words makes students’ work hesitant, prone 
to errors and frustrating. Students in the early letter name–alphabetic stage do not have the 
word knowledge they need to sound out many unknown words, so you should show them 
how to figure out an unknown word by using context. Referring to the number on the card,

the students return to their personal reader to find the word and figure it out with context. 
Because this procedure can be time-consuming, it is important that only a small percentage of 
words in a word bank are unknown. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 3.c, 3.d, (1st) 3.g)
	5.13 	 Reviewing Word Bank Words
There are other ways to review and work with words in the word bank. (CCSS Foundational 
Skills (K) 3.c, 3.d, (1st) 3.g)
1.	Pickup. Lay out a collection of five to ten words face-up. Words that the student does not 
know or frequently confuses are good candidates. Someone calls out the words randomly 
for the student to find and pick up. This simple activity requires the student to use at least 
partial alphabetic cues to find the words, but does not require him or her to sound out 
the word.
2.	I Am Thinking Of. This activity is similar to Pickup, but the student is given clues instead 
of words: “I am thinking of a word that rhymes with pet” or “I am thinking of a word that 
starts like play.”
3.	Concentration.  Make a second set of words and play this classic game as described in 
Activity 4.16 in Chapter 4. Work with no more than ten sets of words at a time so that 
the activity moves quickly.
4.	Word Hunts. Have students look through their word banks for words that have a particular 
feature; for example, words that start with t, words that end in m., or words that have an 
o in them.
5.	Alphabetise Words. Make and laminate a large alphabet strip up to six feet long. Stu-
dents place their words under the beginning letter. Sort pictures by beginning sounds 
as well.
6.	Build sentences. When students have nouns and verbs included in their word banks, they 
can start to build sentences. It’s fun to add the names of friends and family to their word 
bank so they can build sentences like “Devon can run”. During writing time, encourage 
students to use their word banks as a resource for words they might want to use. Sentence 
starter frames such as “I like to…” might get them started if they can’t think of anything 
to write about.
7.	Sort words. Once students have 50 or more words in their word banks, they can use them 
to sort in various ways: by conceptual groups (animals, people, things we do, etc.), by 
beginning sounds, by alphabetical order, etc.
	5.14 	 Read It, Find It
This simple and fun game for two players reinforces the identification of words. (CCSS Foun-
dational Skills (K) 3.c, 3.d, (1st) 3.g)
Materials  You will need 30 pennies, or as many pennies as there are words on the game 
board. Prepare a game board by creating a 5 by 5 or 6 by 6 grid. Write each word into one of 
the spaces on the grid. Prepare a set of word cards that have the same words as those on the 
board and place them face-down. It is okay if some words repeat. You can take words from 
word banks or from previous word sorts.
Procedures
1.	One player flips a penny for heads or tails position. Each player chooses 15 pennies. One 
player will be heads and turns all his or her pennies to the heads side. The other will be 
tails and turns the pennies to the tails side.
2.	The player who did not flip begins by taking a card from the pile and reading it. The 
player then finds the word on the board and covers it with a penny. If the player cannot 
read the word or reads it incorrectly, he or she cannot cover the word. The game proceeds 
as each player draws one card per turn.
3.	The first player to cover 15 words, using up all his or her pennies, is the winner.

Dictionary Skills in the Letter Name–
Alphabetic Stage
Children can begin to use simple dictionaries and learn some basic skills, even in kindergarten 
and first grade.
	5.15 	 Alphabetical Order
Alphabetical order is a skill that students in this stage can begin to master once they know 
their letters. Begin with activities that students can complete with relative ease. You may want 
to demonstrate in whole class and then guide facilitated practice in differentiated groups. 
(CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.a, 3.a)
• Develop flexibility with the alphabet. Help children learn to recite the alphabet in 
order starting at any point and going forward.
• Ask students to quickly find a letter on an alphabet strip to develop a sense of where 
letters fall in sequence; before M or after M is a good starting point.
• Keep a collection of alphabet books handy and ask students to find a page for a partic-
ular letter or beginning sound, and to look for pictures of other things that begin with 
that sound. Get them to think about where to look in the book—beginning, middle or 
end to find the letter.
• Ask students to find words on a word wall. As a partner centre activity, students call 
out words for each other.
• Look for opportunities to order words alphabetically: students’ first names, colour 
words, pictures with their names printed on them.
• Students with at least 50 words enjoy using index card boxes with alphabet dividers to 
organise their word bank words in by the first letter.
• At first have students use alphabet strips as a guide. These strips can a size that fit on 
their desks, or they can be large strips on the floor. Have students place their word 
bank words beside the letters, and have them use pictures in the same way.
• Once large numbers of words end up under the same letter, introduce the idea of 
ordering them by the second letter. Model how to do this as you add words to a word 
wall where you will need to go to even the third or fourth letter to alphabetise words 
like them, then and they.
	5.16 	 Picture Dictionaries and Illustrated Word Books
When you teach young children, keep a simple dictionary handy and occasionally model how 
to look up words. Letter name–alphabetic spellers can begin to use these resources as well. 
Below are some ideas about how to use picture dictionaries along with a list of dictionaries 
and word books for young children.
• Word books are wonderfully illustrated collections of words that are fun for browsing 
but can also be used for word hunts and to get ideas for writing. In Richard Scarry’s 
Best Word Book Ever you can find words arranged thematically, usually in the form of 
labelled pictures. Others like My First Dictionary by DK are arranged alphabetically 
with each word illustrated.
• Students studying beginning blends and digraphs often find words that begin with 
those sounds. They would find chair, change, chicken, choose and chopstick in Curious 
George’s Dictionary.
• In addition, picture dictionaries can be used to for vocabulary development. Because 
he is so active and expressive, Curious George can be used to vividly illustrate words 
such as afraid, before, curious, peek and scamper and each entry word is accompanied by a 
sentence defining that word. Suggestions for supporting young children’s ­exploration

of this dictionary and engagements with print more generally are provided in the 
­dictionary’s Foreword (Templeton, 2008).
• Websites such as Enchanted Learning have simple alphabet books and picture diction-
aries to download and print (see Resource Connections above for a list of dictionaries.)
Study of Initial Consonant Sounds
A number of activities or games in Chapter 4 are appropriate for students in the letter name–
alphabetic stage who are working to master single consonants, digraphs and blends: Soundline 
(4.32), Letter Spin for Sounds (4.33) and Initial Consonant Follow-the-Path Game (4.34). 
Concentration is another adaptable game. Any two pictures that begin with the same sound(s) 
make a match that can be claimed.
	5.17 	 Sound Boards
Materials  Sound boards are references for letter–sound features (beginning conso-
nants, digraphs and blends and vowels); you can find examples in Appendix B. They provide 
a key word and picture for each letter–sound match, helping students internalise the associa-
tions. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 3.a, (1st) 3.a)
Procedures  Place a copy of the sound boards at the front of students’ writing folders or 
personal readers. These boards make it easy for students to find letters to stand for the sounds 
they want to use. Tape reduced copies of relevant sound boards to students’ desks; you can also 
post charts of various letter–sound features. Recently, the new technology of chart printers has 
made it possible to take the individual sound boards and enlarge them to poster size. Add a little 
colour and display them in a prominent place for reference. Keep sound boards in students’ 
word study folders (see Figure 3.19) to serve as a record of progress. Students can lightly colour 
the letters they have studied. Use sound boards to generate more words to add to a word family. 
Write the family rime on a small card and slide it down beside the beginning sounds. In Fig-
ure 5.12, the word family ack has been expanded by adding many different blends and digraphs.
	5.18 	 Hunting for Words and Pictures
Word hunts, described in Chapter 3, are conducted in several different ways and at different 
times in the letter name–alphabetic stage. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2, 3)

Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
1.  Picture Hunts: In the early letter name–
alphabetic stage, students can hunt for pic-
tures that correspond to beginning sounds in 
magazines or catalogues, and paste them onto 
individual papers, onto group charts or into 
alphabet scrapbooks. To save time, you, an aide 
or a student helper can rip out pages on which 
there are pictures that contain the feature 
being hunted. Have students label the pictures 
they find by spelling as best they can. Students 
can also hunt for pictures in alphabet books 
and record their findings as drawings.
2.  Word Hunts: Students can also search for 
words that begin with the particular initial 
consonants, blends or digraphs in famil-
iar reading materials such as their personal 
readers or by going through their own word 
banks. Once they begin studying vowels, pic-
ture and word hunts will help them attend
to those medial sounds and letters. Note that hunting for additional word family words can 
be challenging for certain families unless you have books that have been specially written, but 
words with most short vowels should be plentiful in the materials they are reading (short-u 
words can be harder to find than the others).
At first students will need to be supervised as they work in small groups to find words 
and you, an aide or a helper can serve as a scribe to record their findings. By the late letter 
name–alphabetic stage, students can work independently and record results of word hunts in 
word study notebooks.
	5.19 	 Initial Sound Bingo
In this version of Bingo, students discriminate among the initial sounds. This is another 
activity that can be adapted to single consonant, blends, digraphs and word families. (CCSS 
Foundational Skills (K) 3.a, (1st) 3.a)
Materials  Make Bingo cards with 9 or 16 squares. In each square, write a letter(s) that 
features the sounds students have been studying in sorts. Figure 5.13 shows a game prepared 
to review the s-blends. Note that each card must be different. You also need markers (bottle 
caps, pennies or squares of paper work well) and picture cards to match sounds.
Procedures  Work with small groups of two to four stu-
dents. Give each student a Bingo card and markers. Have stu-
dents take turns drawing a card from the stack and calling out 
the picture name. Students place a marker on the correspond-
ing square. Play continues until someone gets Bingo (three or 
four in a row) or the board is filled.
 5.20 	 Gruff Drops Troll at Bridge
This is a special version of the basic follow-the-path game, 
described in Activity 4.34 in Chapter 4, that reinforces 
r-blends. This game was developed after reading Paul Gal-
done’s The Three Billy Goats Gruff, which was part of a class 
study of books about monsters. Many of the books yielded a 
great crop of consonant-plus-r words such as growl, groan and 
fright. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K–1st) 3.a)

Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
Materials  Prepare a game path filled in with r-blend combinations, as shown in 
­Figure 5.14 (or whatever features you want to review). Add some artwork to create a theme. 
You will also need markers and pictures. Follow-the-path templates and directions for prepar-
ing the boards can be found in Appendix F.
Procedures  Each student selects a marker. Students turn over picture cards and move 
the marker to the correct space. In this game, the winner drops the troll from the bridge by 
turning up a picture that begins with dr (for drop) or tr (for troll) for the last space.
	5.21 	 Match!
In this game, similar to the game of Slap Jack, students look for pairs that match by beginning 
sounds. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K–1st) 3.a)
Materials  Create a set of cards that feature pictures with four to eight different begin-
ning sounds. Include at least four pictures for each sound. Pictures can be copied from Appen-
dix C, glued on card stock and laminated.
Procedures  Each student has half the deck of pictures. Students turn a picture card 
face-up from their deck at the same time. If the pictures begin with the same sound, the first 
person to recognise and say “Match!” gets the pair. If the pictures do not match, another set 
is turned over until a match occurs. There can be penalties for calling out “Match” carelessly, 
such as losing a turn.
The Study of Word Families
Once students begin studying word families, they are expected to read and spell the words 
they sort. Many word games can be adapted, such as Match! (Activity 5.21). Some activities are 
especially designed to enhance students’ understandings of how families work.

	5.22 	 Build, Blend and Extend
This series of teacher-led activities is designed to reinforce phoneme segmentation, phoneme 
blending and using analogy as a spelling strategy (“If I can spell cat, then I can spell fat”) as students 
work with onsets and rimes. This should follow sorting 
lessons in which students have worked with a collection 
of word families. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.a, 2.c, 
2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3.a, 3.b, Language (1st) 2.e)
Materials  Prepare a set of cards to use in a 
pocket chart. Write the targeted onsets and rimes on 
these cards, keeping the letters of the rime together. 
For the at family, you would have cards with at, b, c, f, 
h, m, p, r and s. As students study digraphs and blends, 
add those as well, such as th, ch and fl; see Figure 5.15. 
Give students similar materials to use individually 
after you model for them.
Procedures
1.	Building. This procedure reinforces the spelling of word families. Explain that you are 
going to build or make a word such as bag and display two cards (b and ag). Then ask what 
letter needs to change the word to rag. Replace the b in bag with the r to make the new 
word. Model several words and then have students build additional words that you call 
out: sag, tag and brag.
2.	Blending. This activity reinforces the reading of word families. It is similar to building 
except that you start by displaying a word the students all know, such as cat, and then sub-
stitute a different beginning letter. Model how to blend the new onset with the familiar 
rime to read the word: “Mmmmmm, aaaaaaat, mat. The new word is mat.” Ask students 
to use the two parts of the onset and rime to sound out the word just it was modelled.
3.	Extending. During the extending part of this activity, find words that are not included in the 
sort to demonstrate to students that they can read and spell many more words once they 
know how to spell several words in a family. You may wish to demonstrate using unusual 
words like vat or challenging words with digraphs and blends such as chat, flat or scat.
Variations
1.	Students work with small cards at their seats as you lead the activity, or ask students to 
write the words on paper, small whiteboards or chalkboards.
2.	Add more digraphs and blends as they are studied. There are many words you can make 
with families such as ack and ick.
3.	For the study of short vowels and the CVC pattern, the vowel is separated from the rime 
(at is cut apart into a and t).
	5.23 	 Word Family Wheels and Flip Charts
Wheels and flip charts are fun for students to play with independently or with partners. Use 
the wheels and flip charts to reinforce blending the onset with the rime to read words in word 
families they have sorted. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.a, 2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3.a, 
3.b, Language (1st) 2.e)
Procedures  To make word family wheels, follow these three steps.
1.	Cut two 6-inch circles from tagboard. Cut a wedge from one circle, as shown in Figure 5.16, and 
write the vowel and ending consonants or rime to the right of it. Make a round hole in the centre.
2.	On the second tagboard circle, write beginning sounds that form words with that family. 
For example, the op family can be formed with b, c, h, l, m, p, s, t, ch, sh, cl and st. Space the 
letters evenly around the outside edge so that only one at a time will show through the 
“window” wedge.

3.	Cut a slit in the middle of the second circle. Put the circle with 
the wedge on top of the other circle. Push a brass fastener through 
the round hole and the slit. Flatten the fastener, making sure the 
top circle can turn.
Use the following steps to make flip books:
1.	Use a piece of tagboard or lightweight cardboard for the base of 
the flip book. Write the family or rime on the right half of the 
base.
2.	Cut blank pieces of paper that are half the width of the base piece 
and staple to the left side of the base. Write beginning sounds or 
onsets on each one. Have students draw a picture on the backside 
of the pages to illustrate the word.
	5.24 	 Show Me
This activity is a favourite with teachers who are teaching word families and short vowels. 
(CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.a, 2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3.a, 3.b, Language (1st) 2.e)
Materials  Make each student an individual three-pocket folder to hold letter cards. 
To make the folder, cut paper into approximately 7-by-5-inch rectangles. Fold up a 1-inch 
section along the 7-inch side, and then fold the whole thing into overlapping thirds. Staple 
at the edges to make three pockets (see Figure 5.17). Cut additional paper into 1.5-by-
4-inch cards to make 14 for each student. Print letters on the top half of each card, making 
sure the entire letter is visible when inserted in the pocket. A useful assortment of letters for 
this activity includes the five short vowels and b, d, f, g, m, n, p, r and t. Too many consonants 
can be hard to manage.
Procedures  Each student gets a folder and an assortment of letter cards. When you 
or student helper call out a word, the students put the necessary letters in the spaces and 
fold up their pockets. When “Show me” is announced, all students open their pocket folders 
at once for you to see.
Variations  Start with words having the same families, such as bad, sad or mad, in which 
the students focus primarily on changing the initial consonants. Move on to a different family 
and different vowels. For example, you could follow this sequence: mad, mat, hat, hot, pot, pet. 
Add cards with digraphs or blends to spell words such as sh-i-p or f-a-st.
	5.25 	 Word Maker
Students match blends and digraphs with word families to make words. (CCSS Foundational 
Skills (K) 2.a, 2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3.a, 3.b, Language (1st) 2.e)
Materials  Create a collection of cards that have onsets on one half (single consonants, blends 
and digraphs) and common short vowel rimes on the other, such as at, an, it, ig and so on (similar 
to the cards shown in Figure 5.15). For students in the later letter name–alphabetic stage, include 
rimes with ending blends, digraphs and preconsonantal nasals, such as ish, ang, ast, amp and all.
Procedures
1.	Each student begins by drawing five cards from the deck. With the five cards face-up, each 
student tries to create words, as shown in Figure 5.15.
2.	Once the students have made one or two words from their first five cards, they begin tak-
ing turns drawing cards from the deck. Every time they make a word, they can draw two 
more cards. If they cannot make a word, they draw one card.
3.	Play continues until all the letter cards are used up. The player with the most words is 
the winner.

	5.26 	 Roll the Dice
This game for two to four players reinforces word families. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.a, 
2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3.a, 3.b, Language (1st) 2.e)
Materials  You need a cube on which to write four to six contrasting word families, 
(e.g., an, ap, ag and at). One side can be labelled “Lose a Turn”, and “Roll Again” (see  
Figure 5.18). You will also need a blackboard, paper, chart board or Smartboard for record-
ing words.
Procedures  The first player rolls the dice. If it lands on a word family, the student must 
come up with a word for that family and record it on the chalkboard or paper. Students keep 
their own lists and can use a word only once, although someone else may have used it. If a 
player is stumped or lands on Lose a Turn, the dice is passed to the next person. The person 
who records the most words at the end of the allotted time wins.
Variations  Play with two teams for a relay. The first person of each team rolls the 
dice and writes a word on the board. The player hands the dice to the next player and goes 
to the end of the line. No word can be 
repeated by either team. This game can 
also be used with blends, digraphs and 
vowel patterns.
	 5.27 	 Rhyming Families
Use this is variation of the follow-the-path 
game to reinforce word families. (CCSS 
Foundational Skills (K) 2.a, 2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 
3.a, (1st) 3.a, 3.b, Language (1st) 2.e)
Materials  Prepare a game board as 
shown in Figure 5.19. You will also need 
a single dice or a spinner, pieces to move 
around the board, pencils and paper for 
each player. Directions for making game 
boards and spinners as well as game board 
templates are in Appendix F. Write a word 
from each word family you have been 
studying in each space on the board. You 
can also write in special directions such 
as Roll Again, Go Back Two Spaces and 
Write Two Words.
Procedures  The object is to make new words to rhyme with words on the game board 
that differ from the other players’ words.
1.	Spin to determine who goes first. The first player spins and moves the number of places 
indicated on the spinner. The player reads the word in the space where he or she lands. All 
players write a rhyming word by changing the initial letter(s). Players number their words 
as they go. Play continues until someone reaches the end of the path.
2.	Beginning with the player who reaches the end first, each player reads the first word on 
his or her list. Players who have a word that is different from anyone else’s gets to circle 
that word. Continue until all words have been compared.

Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
3.	Each circle is worth one point; the player who reaches the end first receives two extra 
points. The student with the most points wins the game.
Variations  Label each space on the game board with the rime of a family you have 
studied (at, an, ad, ack). Use no more than five different rimes and repeat them around the 
path. Prepare a set of cards that have pictures corresponding to the families. Students move 
around the board by selecting a picture and moving to the space it matches. For example, a 
student who has a picture of a hat would move to the next space with at written on it.
	5.28 	 Go Fish
This version of the classic game can be used as a review of word families. (CCSS Foundational 
Skills (K) 2.a, 2.c, 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3.a, 3.b, Language (1st) 2.e)
Materials  Create a deck of 32 cards with four words from eight different 
word families written on them (e.g., that, bat, fat and hat). Write each word at the 
top left of the card so that the words are visible when held in the hand, as shown 
in Figure 5.20.
Procedures
1.	Deal five cards to each player and place the remainder in the middle as a draw 
pile.
2.	The first player asks any other player for a match to a card in his or her hand: 
“Do you have any words that rhyme with hat?” If the player receives a matching 
card or cards, he or she may ask for another rhyming word. If the other player 
does not have the card requested, he or she tells the first player to “Go fish”, 
which means that the first player must draw a card from the “fish pond”. The 
first player’s turn is over when he or she can no longer make a match.
3.	Once a player has a set of four rhyming words, they can lay the set down. Play 
continues until one player runs out of cards. Award points to the first person to 
go out and to the person who has the most sets of cards.
Variations  Go Fish can be adapted for beginning sounds and blends using pictures.
Study of Short Vowels
After short vowels have been explored through word sorts and weekly routines, games can 
provide additional practice.
	5.29 	 Hopping Frog Game
This game is for two to four players to review the five short vowels. (CCSS Foundational 
Skills (K) 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3.b)
Materials  Create a game board like the one shown in Figure 5.21. Cut green circle lily 
pads for each space and write CVC words students have used in word sorts on each one (e.g., 
pin, get, hot, bad, leg, run, bug, wish). You will need four frog markers (in different colours) or 
some other playing pieces. The spinner is marked into five sections, with a vowel in each one. 
Add pictures to cue the sound: a, apple; e, ten; i, fish; o, frog; u, sun. See Appendix F for direc-
tions on how to make a spinner.
Procedures  Each student selects a marker. Players take turns spinning and moving their 
markers to the first word that matches the vowel sound on which they land (e.g., e, get). They

then pronounce this word and must say another word with the same vowel sound to stay on 
that space. The next player then spins and plays. The first player who can finish the course 
and hop a frog off the board wins.
Variations  Label the spaces with a, e, i, o or u. Make a collection of short vowel pictures 
on tagboard using the short vowel pictures in Appendix C. It is important that the pictures do 
not show through the card. On several additional cards write commands such as Skip a Turn, 
Go Back Two Spaces and Move Ahead Three Spaces. The players move around the board by 
turning over a picture and moving their playing piece to the next free space on the board that 
has the corresponding short vowel.
	5.30 	 Making-Words-with-Cubes Game
Short vowel words are built with letter cubes in this game. It can be used for other vowels as 
well. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3.b)
Materials  Letter cubes can be found in commercial games or made from blank wooden 
cubes. Write all the vowels on one cube to be sure that a vowel always lands face up. (The 
sixth side can be a star that indicates that the player can select the vowel.) Put a variety of 
consonants on five or six other cubes. (You can write pairs like qu and ck together.) The stu-
dents need a sand clock or timer, paper and pencil and a record sheet such as the one shown 
in Figure 5.22.

Word Study for Beginners in the Letter Name–Alphabetic Stage	
219
Activities | LETTER NAME–Alphabetic Stage
Procedures
1.	In pairs, students take turns being the 
player and the recorder. The recorder 
writes the words made by the player.
2.	A player shakes the cubes, spills them out 
onto the table and then starts the timer. 
Whatever letters land face-up are used 
to make words. The word maker moves 
the cubes to create words and spells 
them to the recorder. The cubes can then 
be moved around to make more words. 
Ignore errors at this point. Write the 
words in columns by the number of letters 
in the words.
3.	When the time ends, the students review 
the words and check for accuracy. Score 
words by counting the total number of 
letters used. Students soon realise that the 
bigger the words they make, the greater 
their score.
Variations  Students in the within word pattern stage should work with two vowel 
cubes. On a second cube, write vowel markers such as e (put two or three), a, i and o. By this 
time, students may be able to use multiplication to total the letters (e.g., 4 three-letter words 
is 12).
	5.31 	 Follow-the-Pictures Spelling Game
This variation of the basic follow-the-path game works as a follow-up to word sorts for short 
vowel words. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3, 3.b)
Materials  Copy pictures from Appendix C for medial short vowels, then cut apart and 
paste them onto a follow-the-path template that you copy from Appendix F. You may need to 
adjust the size to fit. Use two to five short vowels at a time. You will also need playing pieces 
to move along the path and a spinner or single dice. In some spaces you can write Roll Again, 
Go Back Two Spaces and other directives. Include an answer card on which all the words are 
written in the same order they are pasted on the board to settle any arguments about spelling.
Procedures  Students take turns spinning for a number. Before they can move to the 
space indicated by the spinner, they must correctly spell the word pictured. If they cannot 
spell the word, they must stay where they are for that turn. The student who reaches the end 
first is the winner.
Variations  Paste pictures on the game board. Use long vowel pictures for students in 
the within word pattern stage.
	5.32 	 Slide-a-Word
Ask students to list and then read all the CVC words they are able to generate using a slider, 
as seen in Figure 5.23. As different short vowels are studied, the central vowel letter can be 
changed. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 3.d, (1st) 3.b)
Materials  Supplies include tagboard or poster board, ruler, marker, single-edge razor 
blade and scissors. Cut a piece of tagboard or poster board into 8.5-by-2.5-inch strips. Using 
the razor, cut a pair of horizontal slits on each end 1.5 inches apart. Write a vowel in the 
centre. Cut two 12-by-1.5-inch strips for each slider. Thread them through the slits at each

end and print a variety of consonants, blends or digraphs in the spaces as they appear through 
the slits. Turn the strips over and print additional beginning and ending sounds on the back.
Procedures  Students slide the strips to generate as many words as they can, listing each 
word as they find it.
	5.33 	 Put in an m or n: Preconsonantal Nasals
The difference between rag and rang is real but it is subtle, so these contrasts can help learners 
understand how the preconsonantal nasals work. (CCSS Foundational Skills (K) 2.d, 2.e, 3.a, 
3.d, (1st) 3.a, 3.b)
Materials  Create word pairs like the ones listed below on word cards.
rag      rang
rig     ring
sag    sang
tag    tang
cap     camp
rap    ramp
trap  tramp
bag  bang

lip     limp
rug     rung
gag   gang
bet    bent
wig   wing
sprig  spring
pin    ping
hug  hung

swig   swing
Procedures  Three or four students can play. Shuffle and deal all the word cards. Have 
players look for pairs (e.g., rag/rang or cap/camp) in their hands and lay them down before play 
begins. Students then take turns laying down a word from their hand. The student who has 
the match to the pair takes the card, matches it to the word in his or her hand, reads the words 
aloud and adds the two cards to his or her pile. The student with the most cards is the winner.

Word Study for Transitional 
Learners in the Within 
Word Pattern Stage
6

223
O
rthographic development and word study instruction during the within word pattern spelling 
stage helps students build on their knowledge of the sound layer of English orthography as they 
begin to explore the pattern layer. Before we discuss development, let’s visit the classroom of Ms. 
Watanabe, a second-grade teacher working with a group of eight students in the early part of this stage of 
development.
On Monday morning, after meeting briefly with a reading group to share responses to Fox and His Friends by James 
Marshall, Ms. Watanabe takes time to introduce a word sort. She has prepared a word study sheet, like the one in 
Figure 6.1, and has written the words on index cards that she will use to model the sort in a pocket chart. The stu-
dents have already studied the common long a patterns (CVCe in cake, CVV in say and CVVC in chain), and this sort 
will introduce long e patterns. Notice in this lesson how she guides the discussion so that students are led to make 
discoveries and connect with a previous sort.
Ms. Watanabe begins by saying, “Let’s read these words together.” As she reads each of the words, Ms. Wata-
nabe places it randomly at the bottom of her pocket chart. There is some discussion of the homograph read when 
Jason points out that it can be read two ways. They agree for now to pronounce it as “reed”. She then says to the 
group, “Turn and talk to your partner about the sounds and patterns in these words. What do you notice when you 
use your ears and eyes?” After a few minutes she calls on several students to share. Troy explains that they all have 
e’s in them and Ms. Watanabe responds with, “Tell me more.” The group continues discussing the sounds and the 
fact that some words have one e, two e’s or an e and an a.
Ms. Watanabe continues: “Let’s start with a sound sort listening for long and short vowels.” She puts up pictures 
of a web and a queen as headers for the sounds they are to listen for: “We’ll place all the words with short e in the 
middle under this picture of a web. We’ll put words with the long e sound under this picture of a queen. Let’s place 
words that do not fit either under the oddball column.” She places a blank word card on the right side of the pocket 
chart to make a third column. “Jean, get us started. Where would you put this word?”
Jean places the word bed underneath the picture of the web 
while she says, “Web. Bed.”
“Jean, why did you put bed under the web?”
“Because they sound alike in the middle. They both say ‘eh’ in the 
middle.”
“Thank you! David, where would this word go?” Ms. Watanabe 
hands David the word team. David takes the word card and talks 
himself through the task as he has seen Ms. Watanabe model: “Team, 
web. . . Team, queen. Team has a long e sound.” He places the word 
team underneath the picture of the queen.
Further into the sort, the students struggle with the vowel sound 
in the word been but agree it does not really sound like short e so 
they put it in the oddball column. After all the words are sorted, Ms. 
Watanabe and the students check each category by reading the words 
from top to bottom. Then Ms. Watanabe begins the reflection part 
of the lesson with the question, “How are the words in each column 
alike?”
FIGURE 6.1   Long e and 
Short e Word Study Sheet

CH AP TER 6
David notes that the words under 
the picture of the web all have one e. Jean 
points out that the words in the second 
column all have two vowels. This leads to 
Ms. Watanabe’s next question: “Do you see 
some words in the second column that look 
alike or are spelled alike?” Ms. Watanabe 
invites Tomas to come up, and he quickly 
pulls out all the words spelled with ee and 
puts them in a new column, leaving behind 
the words spelled with ea. Once more, 
Ms. Watanabe asks the students how the 
words in each column are alike. She helps 
them come to the conclusion that short 
e is spelled with a single e, whereas long 
e is spelled with two vowels—either ee 
or ea (refer to the final sort in Figure 6.2). 
Ms. Watanabe wants the students to make 
connections with a previous sort, when she 
introduced the use of initials C (for consonant) and V (for vowels) to talk about the patterns; she asks, “These words 
with ee and ea remind me of a long-a pattern we labelled CVVC. Does anyone else notice that?”
The children think for a few moments then Troy begins waving his hand. “Both of these columns have the 
CVVC pattern!” said Troy. Ms. Watanabe asks him to explain and he adds that the words have two vowels in the 
middle just like the ai pattern. “Do the rest of you agree with Troy? Could we say that another way?” asks Ms. Wata-
nabe. Sylvia responds by saying, “Long-e has two different CVVC patterns—ea and ee.”
Ms. Watanabe continues with, “And what about the short-e words?” The students agree that they have the CVC 
pattern—just like short-a. After labelling the headers with C and V to show the patterns, they revisit the oddball 
word been to talk about how it has the CVVC pattern but not the long e sound.
Ms. Watanabe ends the lesson by giving each student a copy of the word study sheet in Figure 6.1. Under her 
direction, the students underline the patterns in the key words and label them with C and V to use as headers. The 
students return to their seats, cut apart the words and sort them independently while Ms. Watanabe checks in with 
another group. Later, Ms. Watanabe moves among the students and asks them, “Why did you put these words to-
gether?” This prompt gets individual students to reflect again on the categories and explain why they sorted as they 
did. Students store their word cards in plastic bags to sort throughout the week. The next day they will sort again, 
and Ms. Watanabe will watch to see how accurately and easily they sort. Later they will write the sort in their word 
study notebooks, work with partners to do a blind sort and a writing sort, and go on a word hunt for more words 
that have the same vowel sounds and patterns. ●

Literacy Development of Students in  
the Within Word Pattern Stage
The within word pattern stage is a transitional stage of literacy development between the 
beginning stage when students’ reading and writing are quite laboured, and the intermediate 
stage when they can read and write a variety of genres more fluently. We think of transitional 

	
Word Study for Transitional Learners in the Within Word Pattern Stage	
225
readers as the “Wright Brothers” of reading: they have taken flight but have limited elevation 
in their reading, and it does not take much to bring them down to frustration level or to cause 
them to be less fluent in their reading. You may find transitional students in the middle-to-
late part of first grade, but most are in second- and third-grade classrooms. You will also find 
struggling readers in middle school and high school who are in this stage (Flanigan, Hayes, 
Templeton, Bear, Invernizzi & Johnston, 2011).
Reading in the Within Word Pattern Stage
Transitional readers read most single-syllable words accurately when they read at their 
instructional level, and they also read many two- and three-syllable words when there is 
enough contextual support. During this stage, students move from the full alphabetic phase 
to the consolidated alphabetic phase (Ehri, 2000), in which they begin to recognise pat-
terns and chunks to analyse unfamiliar words. Instead of processing a word like chest as four 
or five letters to match to sounds (ch-e-s-t), they process it as two chunks (ch-est). This enables 
them to decode and store words more readily and their sight word vocabulary grows quickly. 
This, in turn, enables them to read in phrases and with greater expression (Templeton &  
Bear, 2011). Most fingerpointing characteristics from the beginning stage disappear, and 
transitional readers read orally at rates of over 60 words per minute (Bear, 1992; Bear & 
Cathey, 1989; Morris, 2013; Morris et al., 2013; Huang, Tortorelli & Invernizzi, 2014). All of 
these factors account for a transitional reader’s increasing fluency compared to the dysfluent, 
word-by-word reading in the beginning stage of literacy.
Students generally read out loud at the beginning of the transitional period, but by the 
end they can manage substantial periods of silent reading during Drop Everything and Read 
(DEAR) or Sustained Silent Reading (SSR). They can read independently without support 
and this makes it possible to use reading group time to share reactions to a selection. Tran-
sitional readers can discuss text in greater depth than they did as beginning readers, partly 
because what they read is longer and more complex.
Books for transitional readers cover a wide range of levels, from late first-/early second- 
through third-grade materials. In the early part of this stage, transitional readers read and 
reread familiar text from several sources—core reading programs, picture books and favourite 
poems. They can read beginning chapter books such as the Frog and Toad books (by A. Lobel) 
and the Henry and Mudge books (by C. Rylant). By the end of this stage, students can read 
easy chapter books such as The Time Warp Trio series (by J. Scieska), the Encyclopedia Brown 
series (by D. Sobol) or the Magic Tree House series (by M. P. Osbourne). Transitional readers 
also explore different genres, and informational text is more accessible. For example, they 
read informational books from the Let’s Find Out and I Can Read series, and magazines such 
as Ranger Rick.
Lots of reading experience is crucial during this stage. Students should read 
­instructional- and independent-level materials for at least 30 minutes each day (Hal-
laday, 2012). They need this practice to propel them into the next stage; otherwise, they 
will stagnate as readers and writers. You can promote fluent and expressive reading, which 
is an important goal during this stage (Rasinski, 2010), with repeated and timed repeated 
readings (Samuels, 1979), reader’s theatre and poetry readings. However, fluent, expressive 
reading relies on automatic word recognition and extensive word knowledge (Bear, 1989). 
Simply trying to increase reading rates without building the underlying word knowledge is 
a shortsighted goal.
Writing in the Within Word Pattern Stage
Just like reading, writing also becomes more fluent during this period because students know 
how to automatically spell many words. They write with greater speed and less conscious 
attention (Bear, 1991a; Nagy, Berninger, Abbott, Vaughan & Vermeulen, 2003). This added 
fluency gives transitional writers more time to concentrate on ideas, which may account 

	 226	
CH AP TER 6
for the greater sophistication in the way 
they express their ideas. Cognitively, they 
compose with a better sense of the reader’s 
background knowledge and with a greater 
complexity in the story line or informa-
tional piece.
Excerpts of Yolanda’s two-and-a-half-
page, single-spaced story about a squir-
rel named Nuts (see Figure 6.3) show 
how much students know about written 
language and spelling in the later part of 
the within word pattern stage. Yolanda, a 
second-grader, has a rich language base 
and she writes with a strong voice. In terms 
of orthographic knowledge, Yolanda spells 
most long vowel patterns and r-influenced 
words correctly (woke, search). But her word 
knowledge is not stable, as seen in her later 
spelling of searches as SERCHES and her 
overgeneralisation of patterns (BREAK-
FEAST for breakfast and HOWL for whole). 
Later in the story, Yolanda spelled thought 
as TOOUGHT but then went back and wrote in an h. She also confuses homophones (there/
their). Yolanda is a late within word pattern speller who should be placed in a word study group 
in which students are studying diphthongs and ambiguous vowels.
Vocabulary Learning
Estimates vary, but students in the early grades can, on average, add 10 to 15 new words a week 
to their oral vocabularies (Biemiller, 2005). During the transitional stage of literacy, you need 
to take an active and deliberate role in making sure this vocabulary growth happens for all 
students. You can make words interesting in many ways and in so doing help students become 
“wordsmiths”—children who are curious about words, their sounds, meanings and usage. This 
type of attitude towards words raises students’ word consciousness or word awareness, which 
is a critical aspect of vocabulary growth (Blachowicz & Fisher, 2009; Lubliner & Scott, 2008; 
Scott, Skobel & Wells, 2008; Stahl & Nagy, 2006).
Do not confuse vocabulary instruction with spelling or phonics instruction (Gehsmann &  
Templeton, 2011/2012, 2013). When we refer to vocabulary we are referring to meaning 
and concepts. We have observed that sometimes teachers assign spelling words in elemen-
tary classrooms that are really vocabulary words (e.g., butterfly, chrysalis, antenna). Although 
students in the within word pattern stage can read and learn the meanings of many multi-
syllabic words (glimmer, strategy, gesture), they should not be expected to spell those words. 
This difference reflects the slant of development in word learning during the elementary 
years; the words students may read and study for meaning are more complex than those 
they study in spelling. For example, with context you can probably identify the partially 
spelled word in this sentence, “The caterpillar changes into a butterfly during the time it 
spends in the c-r-s-lis.” However, spelling chrysalis is a challenge for even adult spellers. 
Spelling a word is more exact than reading a word, as every letter must be represented 
accurately.
There are many ways you can help students develop a deeper, richer oral vocabulary. Use 
sophisticated language in daily interactions (see Chapter 5, page 175), and develop the habit of 
commenting on and making observations about words throughout the day. Read-alouds, word 
sorts and concept sorts provide opportunities to discuss new words and focus on multiple 
meanings. Students in this stage should start using a dictionary as a reference tool and begin 
FIGURE 6.3   Yolanda’s Squirrel Story

	
Word Study for Transitional Learners in the Within Word Pattern Stage	
227
studying common prefixes and suffixes and how they affect the meaning of the base words to 
which they attach.
Read-Alouds.  Good children’s literature is the best starting place for vocabulary 
­learning and is a much richer source than television or adult daily conversation (Hayes 
& Ahrens, 1988). Picture books and chapter books are full of new, rich vocabulary that is 
wrapped in complex sentences. Context is the key to unpacking the meanings of new words 
from read-alouds, and with your help, students can develop that skill to learn the meanings of 
new words. During and after listening to books read aloud, encourage students to talk about 
what they heard. Use the think-pair-share strategy described in Activity 5.2 to maximise the 
opportunity for everyone to use oral language.
When learning new vocabulary during this stage, students benefit from repeated exposure 
to words and from seeing the words in print as they hear them (Beck, McKeown & Kucan, 
2013; Rosenthal & Ehri, 2008). To help students, record the words on cards, charts and webs; 
post them for everyone to see; and refer to them as a reminder to use them in conversation 
throughout the day. It takes many exposures, over several weeks and in multiple contexts for 
students to learn a new word, so be deliberate when using new words and encouraging stu-
dents to use them as well. Refer back to the last chapter for anchored vocabulary instruction 
in Activity 5.1 (Juel, Biancarosa, Coker & Deffes, 2003).
Word Sorts and Vocabulary.  Always take the time to read through words in a 
spelling sort to be sure students know the meanings. Most of the words will be familiar ones, 
unless students are English learners, but there are still opportunities to explore the meaning 
layer of English, most specifically in the case of homophones and homonyms.
Students will encounter many homophones during this stage; these words that sound 
the same but are spelled differently provide rich fodder for vocabulary development. Why is 
thrown, the verb, spelled with an ow? Because the vowel-consonant-e pattern is already taken 
for the noun throne—the chair occupied by kings and queens. The spelling pattern reflects 
the different meaning! Share with students that we spell these words differently because they 
mean different things! This insight provides a fun and interesting approach to both spelling and 
vocabulary instruction.
Create an ongoing collection, such as a Homophone Pear/Pair Tree, as a whole-class 
activity in second- or third-grade classrooms that goes on all year long. When students dis-
cover a homophone pair, ask them to write it on a pear shape and 
then add it to the branch of a tree posted on a bulletin board. This 
encourages students to always be on the lookout for homophones. 
They will truly become wordsmiths as they collect hundreds of 
homophones, such as the ones on page 399 in Appendix E. Usu-
ally there is one homophone in a pair that is familiar (bear), while 
the other one (bare) is what Beck and colleagues (2013) call a Tier 
2 word. These are words that students can use in multiple contexts 
and are part of the general academic vocabulary that students need 
to acquire throughout the school years (Templeton et al., 2015). As 
teachers, we can never rest until we wrest every ounce of meaning 
from word study!
English is also rich in homonyms—words that are spelled the 
same but have different meanings (park the car or play in the park). 
There are also homographs—words spelled alike but pronounced 
differently (read). Look for these words in word sorts and take the 
time to explore the multiple meanings through discussion, illustra-
tion and examples in sentences. Consider a simple homonym like 
block—something you build with, something you run around in the 
neighbourhood, something you might do during a soccer game, and 
a portion of time.

Polysemous words and phrases share meaning in their origin, like bed, a place for sleeping 
and the place where a stream runs, or the two meanings of head, a part of the body or the chief 
of an organisation. Native speakers and English learners alike benefit from spending time 
reviewing the many meanings of words. Be sure to point out how context helps to determine 
which meaning should be taken into account.
Concept Sorts.  Studying subjects such as math, science and social studies expose stu-
dents to many new ideas and vocabulary that they can explore through concept sorts. In Activ-
ity 6.1, we describe a concept sort with math terms related to addition (plus, combine, increase) 
and subtraction (take away, difference, decrease) and also offer other examples. To prepare 
concept sorts, preview the vocabulary in textbooks or other curricular materials looking for 
the key terms, and then write them on cards or sorting templates like the one in Appendix F. 
Work with students to brainstorm words on a particular topic (e.g., words related to outer 
space, government words or key vocabulary words from other content areas) that can then be 
sorted into categories.
Plan a concept sort for the beginning of a study unit as an informal assessment of back-
ground knowledge. Begin by going over the words to be sure students can read them and 
are familiar with the meanings of the words (they will develop deeper understanding with 
repeated exposure). Students can sort the words as an open sort either individually or with a 
partner. This enables you to see what students know about a topic and get a sense of the dif-
ficulty of the reading. Similarly, at the end of a study unit, ask students to complete the sort 
again and add related words to show what they learned.
Dictionaries.  All kinds of dictionaries and thesauruses are important resources for 
within word pattern stage students. Students in the beginning of this stage can start using 
­dictionaries to check word meanings. This does not mean students should be assigned to 
look up ten definitions to fulfil a seatwork or homework requirement—a strategy sure to 
make them dislike dictionaries. Instead, use a dictionary as a resource during reading groups, 
class discussions, word study lessons and content area study to answer questions and provide 
information. For example, the dictionary can help students understand what vent means in the 
sentence “Josh had to vent when he got outside with his friends.”
The best way to encourage dictionary use in your classroom is to keep dictionaries handy 
and use them often to look up definitions, to check spellings or to answer questions such 
as, “Do many words begin with QU?” Model for students how interesting and informative 
dictionaries can be and show them how they are organised. Once students have some skill 
using alphabetical order and guide words, take turns assigning a student each day to be the 
dictionary “meister” responsible for looking up any word that the class is curious about. Or, 
when introducing a new sort, ask students to each look up one word and report what they 
found out, particularly the multiple meanings of homonyms like drive, or fudge. Children’s 
dictionaries are most appropriate for second to fourth grade, where you will find most within 
word pattern spellers. Modern dictionaries, such as the Merriam-Webster Children’s Dictionary 
published by DK, are visual feasts that invite students to browse. See Activities 6.7 and 6.8 for 
resources and ideas about teaching dictionary skills. Over the course of this stage, build a word 
reference area in your class library that includes thesauruses, various dictionaries (like rhyming 
dictionaries), Spanish and other language dictionaries and books of antonyms, synonyms and 
homophones. While students’ spelling focuses on the single-syllable word patterns, students 
can use these references to learn more about the meaning of two- and three-syllable words.
Basic Morphology: Prefixes and Suffixes.  Students learn to spell prefixes 
and ­suffixes in the next stage—syllables and affixes. However, they are taught simple affixes 
as meaning vocabulary beginning in late first and early second grade, when most students are 
developmentally in the within word pattern stage of spelling. Some prefixes and suffixes are 
included at the primary level in the Common Core State Standards adopted by most states 
(2010). Understanding how simple affixes combine with base words lays the foundation for 
more extensive exploration in forming words later on. But words with affixes are explored first 

	
Word Study for Transitional Learners in the Within Word Pattern Stage	
229
as vocabulary words that students encounter during reading and content studies. They should 
not be treated as spelling words until students know how to spell the base words on which they 
are built.
The most common prefixes in the English language are un- (meaning “not”), re- (“again”), 
in- (“not”) and dis- (“not”), and account for about 58 percent of all prefixes (White, Sowell 
& Yanagihara, 1989). Some state standards mandate studying the prefixes un- and re- as well 
as the suffixes -ly, -ful and -y, and the comparatives -er/-est in second grade. Use frequently 
occurring and easily understood words to walk students through a discussion of, for example, 
small/smaller/smallest versus tall/taller/tallest to learn how suffixes are added to a base word to 
change the meaning. Beginning with the base word care, talk about being careful and watching 
over a baby brother or sister carefully. Appendix E has lists of words with prefixes and suffixes.
Orthographic Development in  
the Within Word Pattern Stage
Students in the within word pattern stage use but confuse vowel patterns (Invernizzi, 
Abouzeid & Gill, 1994). They no longer spell boat sound by sound to produce BOT but as 
BOTE, BOWT, BOOT or even BOAT as they experiment with the possible patterns for the 
long-o sound. When spellers begin including silent letters, they are ripe for instruction in long 
vowel patterns. In Eduardo’s early within word pattern writing in Figure 6.4, we see that he 
knows a good deal about short vowels, spelling with, pick, on, it and up correctly and blanket 
as BLANCKET. But Eduardo is experimenting with long vowel patterns, as in PLAED for 
played and TOOTHE for tooth.
Table 6.1 summarises students’ orthographic development across the within word pattern 
stage. Short vowels, blends and digraphs are nearly mastered and should only require some 
review. Their phonemic awareness is well developed and they should be able to isolate the 
vowel sounds in the middle of words. However, learning the various ways the sounds within 
those words can be spelled with patterns is the challenge—and accounts for the name selected 
to label this stage.
The Pattern Layer
Students in this stage explore the pattern layer of English spelling. This requires a higher 
degree of abstract thinking because they face two tasks at once. They must not only isolate 
the phonemes to determine the sounds they need to represent, but must also choose from a 
variety of patterns that represent the same phoneme, which usually involves silent letters as 
part of the vowel spelling (cute, through suit) or special consonant patterns (lodge, itch). There 
are several reasons why the same phoneme may be spelled with different patterns.
• How words are spelled may depend on their histories and origins. English has been enriched with 
vocabulary from many different languages over hundreds of years and has also imported 
diverse vowel sounds and spelling patterns. In addition, certain patterns 
represent sounds that have changed over the centuries. For example, 
igh, as in knight, once sounded quite different from long-i (the word 
was pronounced k-n–ict in early Middle English). Over time, pronun-
ciation is simplified but spelling tends to stay the same. Therefore, one 
vowel sound may be spelled many different ways (Vallins, 1954).
• How vowel sounds are spelled may depend on their position within a word. 
Comparing words such as say and rain reveals that, in single-syllable 
words, long-a is usually spelled ay at the end of a word (but rarely in 
the middle) and often ai in the middle (but never at the end). Similarly, 
oy and ew ­usually occur at the ends of words or syllables whereas oi, ui 
and ou occur in the middle of words.

• How vowel sounds are spelled may depend on sounds next to them. Examining words such as 
ridge and cage reveals that the /j/ sound is usually spelled dge when it follows a short vowel 
and ge when it follows a long vowel.
• How vowel words are spelled may depend on the meaning of the word. Although the long vowel 
sound in /pa-n/ may be spelled a-consonant-e or ai, the appropriate spelling is determined 
by meaning. Are you writing about the glass in a window (pane) or extreme discomfort 
(pain)? The meaning carries with it a consistent spelling: the /sa-l/ on a boat is always 
spelled sail; the /sa-l/ where products are sold is always spelled sale. For homophones like 
these, we hang our memory for spelling on a meaning hook.
The Complexities of English Vowels
Studying vowel patterns characterises much of the word study during the within word pattern 
stage. Short vowels pose a problem for letter name–alphabetic spellers because they do not 
match a letter name. However, once students learn to associate the five common short vowel 
sounds with a, e, i, o and u, the relationship is usually one letter to one sound. In contrast, 
mastering other vowels is challenging due to the following factors.
1.	 There are many more vowel sounds than there are letters to represent them. Each des-
ignated vowel, including y, represents more than one sound. Listen to the sound of a 
in these words: hat, car, war, saw, father, play. To spell so many sounds, vowels are often 
paired (e.g., the ai as a long-a in rain, or au for the sound in caught), or a second vowel or

consonant is used to mark or signal a particular sound. The silent e in came, the y in play 
and the w in saw are all silent vowel markers.
2.	 Not only are there more vowel sounds than vowels, most of those sounds are spelled 
a number of different ways, as indicated in Table 6.2. However, some spelling patterns 
are far more likely to occur than others. For example, there are more instances of the 
a-consonant-e pattern (VCe) for the long-a sound in the middle of a syllable than for any 
of the other patterns. It is important to know that there just aren’t that many words in 
which long-a is spelled ei, as in eight.
3.	 In addition to short and long vowels, there are “other” vowel sounds, all of which are 
spelled with various patterns. These include r-influenced vowels (car, sir, earn), diph-
thongs that blend two vowel sounds (brown, toy) and ambiguous vowels that are neither 
long nor short (caught, chalk, straw, thought). These other vowel patterns involve either a 
second vowel, or the vowel is influenced by a consonant letter that has some vowel-like 
qualities, such as l, r or w (bald, bird, crowd).
4.	 English is a language of multiple dialects, and the dialect differences are noticeable in 
the pronunciations of vowels. In some regions of the United States, the long-i sound in 
a word like pie is really more of a vowel diphthong as in pi-e (can you hear both a long-i 
and a bit of a long-e at the end?). House may be pronounced more like hoose in some areas, 
and roof may sound like ruff. Sometimes the final r in r-controlled vowels is dropped, 
as in Boston where you “pahk the cah” (park the car). In other regions, a final r is added 
to words, as in the “hollers” (hollows) of southwest Virginia. Such regional dialects add 
colour and interest to the language, but some teachers worry about how speakers of such 
dialects will learn to spell if they cannot pronounce words “correctly”. Rest assured that 
these students will learn to associate certain letter patterns with their own pronunciations

and will also, over time, learn the sound patterns of Standard American English (Cantrell, 
2001). The value of word sorting over more inflexible phonics programs is that students 
can sort according to their own pronunciations, and a miscellaneous or oddball column 
can be used for variant pronunciations.
5.	 Many words in English do not match even one of the patterns listed in Table 6.2. 
These words are sometimes called “exceptions to the rule”. We prefer to put them in 
the miscellaneous or oddball category. When students study words in the within word 
pattern stage, the oddball category will get a lot of use. Sometimes these words are true 
exceptions (was, build and been); at other times they are not exceptions, but rather part 
of a little known category. One little-known category is illustrated in dance, prince and 
fence—because of the final e, the words may look like they should have long vowel pat-
terns. But in these words, the e is there to signal or mark the “soft” /s/ sound of c (consider 
the alternative: danc, princ and fenc). Do not ignore the exceptions; in fact, deliberately 
include a few such words in your sorts. They become memorable as deviations from the 
common patterns.
6.	 English vowels pose special challenges for English learners as they compare vowels in 
their primary language with English. Students find that some vowels in English are not 
made in their languages, and that the vowels may not be spelled the same ways. English 
learners’ strategies in this stage are discussed later in more depth.
Despite the complexity of vowel spellings, by the end of the within word pattern stage, 
students who have experienced systematic word study have a good understanding of vowel 
patterns in one-syllable words. This knowledge is required to examine the way syllables are 
joined during the next stage of development, the syllables and affixes stage. For example, when 
students understand the patterns in words like bet and beat, they are ready to understand why 
betting has two ts and beating has only one.
The Influence of Consonants on Vowels
In English, vowel patterns often consist of two vowels, one of which signals or marks a 
­particular sound for the other vowel. Common examples are the silent e in words such as bake 
and green; however, consonants are also vowel markers, such as the gh in night and sigh, which 
signals the long-i sound. Students who associate the CVC pattern with short vowels may  
be puzzled by saw, joy, hall or car. In those words, w, y and l no longer act as consonants but 
take on vowel-like qualities. The consonant sound of l is lost in a word like talk—it has become 
part of the vowel sound, which is neither long nor short. When w precedes a, ar and or the 
vowel takes on a different sound, as in wand, war and word. These words may look like they  
are exceptions, but they are, in fact, simply additional patterns that are very regular. This is 
why it is important to learn patterns that relate to sound and meaning as opposed to memoris-
ing rules. The influence of r is particularly common and deserves further discussion.
The R-Influenced Vowels.  As our friend Neva Viise says, “R is a robber!” The 
presence of an r following a vowel robs the sound from the vowel before it. The terms 
r-influenced or r-controlled both refer to this situation. Listen to the sound of a in car—it 
sounds quite different from short a in cap. The influence of r in er, ir and ur makes them indis-
tinguishable in some cases (herd, bird, curd). Even long vowel sounds before the robber r are 
pronounced differently than the same vowels preceding other consonants (pair versus pain). 
Young students sometimes confuse r-blends with r-influenced vowels, as in the spelling of girl 
as GRIL or bird as BRID. They can hear an r but are not sure of its location.
Triple Blends, Silent Initial Consonants and Other  
Complex Consonants
There are several other consonant issues that pose challenges for within word pattern spellers 
who already know basic beginning and ending consonant blends and digraphs. For example, 

	
Word Study for Transitional Learners in the Within Word Pattern Stage	
233
three-letter blends and digraphs often require further study: spr (spring), thr (throw), squ 
(square), scr (scream), shr (shred), sch (school), spl (splash) and str (string). Because words that con-
tain these triplets have a variety of vowel patterns, they are specifically studied towards the 
end of the stage but you can include them in sorts throughout the stage when appropriate. 
There are also several silent consonants to study in one-syllable words: kn (knife), wr (wrong) 
and gn (gnaw).
Another pattern of special interest is related to vowel sounds. Based on Venezky’s (1970) 
work, Henderson (1990) called these complex consonant patterns. For example, students in 
the within word pattern stage can examine words that end in ck (kick), tch (catch) and dge (ledge). 
Contrasting these pairs helps students make interesting discoveries. Say the following word 
pairs and listen to the vowel sounds.
tack	
take	
fetch	
peach	
fudge  huge
lick	
like	
notch	
roach	
badge	 cage
rack	
rake	
patch	
poach	
ledge	
siege
smock  smoke	
sketch  reach	
ridge	
page
What do you notice about the vowel sounds in the ck, tch and dge patterns? What about the 
vowel sounds in the ke, ch and ge patterns? By now you’ve probably figured out that ck (tack), 
tch (fetch) and dge (fudge) are associated with short vowel sounds, whereas ke (take), ch (peach) 
and ge (huge) are associated with long vowel sounds.
The consonants g and c have two different sounds that are determined by the vowel that 
follows them. When g and c are followed by a, o and u, they have a “hard” sound, as in gate and 
cake. When they are followed by i, e or y, they have a “soft” sound (/s/ or /j/) as in ginger or 
cent. (C is more regular than g because the g is hard in many words like girl and gill.) Similarly, 
words ending in ce (dance), ge (edge), ve (leave) and se (sense) have a silent-e associated with the 
consonant rather than the vowel. These patterns illustrate that how sounds are spelled often 
depends on other sounds next to them.
Homophones, Homographs and Other Features
Homophones will inevitably turn up when students study vowel patterns and you can include 
them in the word sorts you plan even at the beginning of this stage. However, we also rec-
ommend an intensive look at homophones at the end of this stage. At this point, students 
know most of the vowel patterns and are ready to focus on the meanings of the words. The 
different spellings of homophones (Mary/marry/merry) and the different pronunciations of 
homographs (wind up string, listen to the wind) may at first seem confusing, but they reflect 
the historical origins and may even make reading easier and meaning clearer (cf., Taft, 1991; 
Templeton, 1992).
Pairs of homographs and homophones sometimes differ grammatically as well as semanti-
cally. For example, when you discuss the homophones read and red, it makes sense to talk about 
the past tense of the verb to read and the colour word red. Take the opportunity to explore the 
interaction of sound, pattern and meaning of irregular or “strong” verbs. Many of these verbs 
differ by vowel sounds (drink/drank), spelling patterns (pay/paid) or both (sweep, swept). Study-
ing contractions presents students with a new series of features to examine that are rooted in 
the pattern and meaning layers of the orthography. For example, we examine meaning when 
we compare its and it’s or we’re and were.
Spelling Strategies
Students in the within word pattern stage have a growing store of known words they can spell 
accurately, including many high frequency words, but there are still many words they don’t 
know how to spell. Accept students’ best spelling efforts but make it clear that they are also 
accountable for spelling word features they have formally studied, and that they should use a 
variety of strategies to spell words they do not know.

	 234	
CH AP TER 6
Encourage Students to Try a Word Several Ways.  Teach students 
to attempt spelling a word before they ask for help, and offer positive feedback on what they 
try. Australians Parry & Hornsby (1988) described this popular strategy as “have-a-go”, and 
various forms have been developed. See Activity 6.6 for an example and procedures.
Use Posted Resources in the Room.  Model for students how to use a word 
wall (described in Chapter 3), calendar, number and colour charts, homophone charts and other 
word sources displayed in the classroom. Modelling the use of these resources as you write for 
students is essential if you want them to use the resources for themselves. For example, if you 
write the sentence “Today is the first day of October,” remind students that the name of the 
month is on the calendar. Or if you need to spell “through”, identify it as a word wall word 
and model how you first listen to the beginning sound and then check out the words under T. 
Challenge students to master words that they use frequently to wean them from the word wall.
Use Spelling Dictionaries to Look Up Words.  Spelling dictionaries 
or personal dictionaries are simply alphabetic lists of words (without definitions) commonly 
needed by young writers. This can be as simple as a blank book made by folding several sheets 
of paper (put two or three letters on each page). You can also download printable versions, 
or buy commercially prepared books like those listed below. These usually have one or two 
pages for each letter with a list of the most common words as well as space for students to 
add more words.
• My Dictionary, available from Sunshine Books International (65 pages), also has words 
organised thematically
• My Word Book, published by Primary Concepts (35 pages)
• Words I Use When I Write (different grade levels), available from Educators Publishing 
Service
Add words from the word walls to spelling dictionaries as they are introduced. Students 
might also request words that they want to use in their writing on a regular basis. Model 
for students how to use a spelling dictionary by narrowing down the beginning sound and 
first letter before thinking about where in the alphabet that letter would be—the beginning, 
middle or end. Personal dictionary words can also be organised thematically by colours, food, 
action words, word wall words and content area words that students might need for writing 
about a topic of study.
Remind Students What They Know.  Students often forget to use what they 
already know to figure out something new. Here are reminders to use when students ask you 
how to spell a word, or during conferencing when you see they have made a mistake.
Use rhymes to make analogies.  One easy way to encourage students to puzzle out the spell-
ing of a new word on their own is to ask them if they know how to spell another word that 
rhymes. For example, if a student is unsure of how to spell the name of the country Spain 
ask her if she knows how to spell rain, drain or brain. Of course, not all words that rhyme are 
spelled the same (e.g., mane also rhymes with Spain), but thinking of a known rhyming word 
will work more times than not. Prompt students by saying something like, “if you know how 
to spell night, then you can spell slight”.
Use word chunks.  Encourage students to get down chunks of the word that they are sure of 
first, then tackle the next part. Getting down the initial consonant chunk, whether it is a single 
consonant, a blend or a digraph, leaves the vowel and what follows as the chunk to ponder.
Use the “best bet” strategy.  While sorting and studying vowel patterns, students will notice 
that one pattern invariably has more examples than another. For example, there are always 
more long-u words spelled u-consonant-e than long-u words spelled with ui. Prompt students 
to think about the most common pattern they know first, and then use some of the other 
strategies such as thinking of rhyming words they know.

Word Study Instruction for the Within  
Word Pattern Stage
Carefully planned word sorts are a systematic way to guide students’ mastery of the 
­complexities of vowel and consonant patterns in the within word pattern stage. Principles of 
instruction were previously outlined in Chapter 2 but here we highlight five that are particu-
larly applicable to this stage:
• Use words students can read.  Be sensitive to the difficulty of words in the sort and make 
sure students can read most of them easily. Words starting with consonant blends, like 
blame or frame, are harder than words starting with single consonants like came or name 
even though they share the same CVCe spelling pattern. If there are words that students 
cannot read set them aside and revisit them later in the sort when they can apply what 
they have learned to sound out the word.
• Look for what students use but confuse.  A spelling inventory will give you a good idea of what 
students know and what they are ready to learn. However, it is also important to look in 
your students’ personal writing and reading materials for words to include in sorts. The 
words students can already read and spell are still useful when they are looking for pat-
terns across words to form generalisations. 
• Sort by sound and pattern.  Plan sorts that first ask students to contrast vowels by how they 
sound. Long vowels should be first introduced by comparing them to their corresponding 
short vowel sounds, as Ms. Watanabe did in the vignette at the beginning of this chapter. 
Sound sorts are important because sound is the first clue that spellers have to use and 
because certain patterns go with certain vowel sounds. You can use long and short vowel 
pictures for sound sorts, but most sound sorts at this stage are done with words. Consider 
using pictures as the column headers for your initial sound sort. After sorting by sound, 
sort by sight—look for the visual orthographic spelling patterns used to spell each sound 
category.
• Avoid teaching rules—instead, have students find reliable patterns.  Traditionally, students were 
taught rules about silent-e and jingles like “when two vowels go walking the first one does 
the talking”. However, rules are often unreliable. For example, the rule about two vowels 
works for oa and ai in boat and rain, but does not work for oy or oi in boy or join, yet oy and 
oi are regular spelling patterns (Johnston, 2001). We prefer to talk about patterns rather 
than rules. The time to talk about rules is when students have already observed a pattern, 
can think of examples that fit the pattern, and understand the pattern as demonstrated in 
their reflections. Consider rules as useful mnemonics for something already understood; 
they are not for teaching.
• Don’t hide exceptions.  Include two or three oddball words in sorts when appropriate. For 
example, include love and some in a long-o sort, which look as though they fit the CVCe 
pattern but whose vowel sounds are not long. However, don’t overdo it. Too many odd-
balls placed in a sort can make it difficult for students to find the pattern. The best odd-
balls are high-frequency words like done or come that students already know how to read. 
High-frequency words (both regular and irregular) are listed in Appendix E and marked 
with asterisks in the word lists. Help students see that even the oddballs are mostly correct 
in terms of sound–spelling correspondences; it is often the vowel sound or spelling that 
is “odd”. Students enjoy the challenge of finding the oddballs in a sort and the oddballs 
often serve as the real test of whether students are sorting carefully.
The Word Study Lesson Plan in the Within Word Pattern Stage
Word sorts often begin as a teacher-directed activity and then offer individual practice 
throughout the week. Most sorts will follow the standard format presented in Chapter 3 and 
are reviewed here.
for Words Their Way®
Ready-made sorts are available 
to print.

	 236	
CH AP TER 6
1.	 Demonstrate the sort.  When starting a sort, go over the words with students to be sure they 
can read the words and talk briefly about the meanings of unfamiliar words or multiple 
meanings of polysemous words like park or train. If there are more than a few words 
whose meanings students do not know, which is often the case for English learners, con-
tinue to talk about the meanings throughout the week. After going over the words, begin 
the sort with an open-ended question such as, “What do you notice about these words?”
As described in Chapter 3 there are many ways to introduce a sort. In a teacher-
directed or closed sort, some teachers set up the categories with key pictures or key 
words, as Ms. Watanabe did with short-e and long-e. Other teachers like to establish 
the key words as part of the group discussion with students, then highlighted. Teacher-­
directed closed sorts are helpful when students are new to sorting or when they start 
studying a new feature. Once students understand the process, use open sorts to require 
more analytic thinking and encourage discovery. Ask students look for their own catego-
ries and then explain why they sorted the way they did. After sorting, lead a discussion to 
focus students’ attention on the distinguishing features. See Table 3.2, Questions to Guide 
Critical Thinking during Word Study, on page 84.
2.	 Check and reflect.  After completing a sort, read down each column to listen for sounds or 
look for patterns and reflect on what the sort reveals. Asking students, “How are these 
words alike?” is a good question to get started on the reflection part of a lesson. If stu-
dents do not come up with the insights needed to understand the feature, be ready to 
model your own thinking and the language students need to talk about words. You might 
say, “When I look at all the words in this column, I notice that the vowel sound is long 
and the pattern is consonant-vowel-vowel-consonant.” A sort is successful when students 
sort accurately and quickly, and can discuss why they sorted as they did. If students seem 
just to mimic other students, you can ask them to say it another way or ask, “What else 
did you notice about the words we sorted?” When there are errors in the sort, offer 
gentle hints such as, “One word in this column does not sound (or look) right. Can you 
find it?”
3.	 Extend: Students work independently across the week.  After a group sort, it is important for 
students to work independently or with partners using their own sets of words. Some 
teachers create reusable sorts in manila folders with the key words or pictures at the top 
and the words stored in a plastic bag inside the folder. Figure 6.5 shows a student isolat-
ing the long-e sound in leaf before placing it in the column with the picture of the feet at 
the top. Saying the words aloud and comparing them in this way is a necessary strategy 
when students begin a sort. Word study is extended through 
activities that students complete at their seats, in word study 
notebooks, at a word study centre or at home. Word hunts 
in previously read material provide opportunities for students 
to make connections between what they are learning in word 
study and the words they read in books (page 86 in Chap-
ter  3). Often students will find more difficult two-or-three 
syllable examples of a feature they have been studying in one-
syllable words. For example, they might find retreat, ordeal or 
creature as examples of the long-e sound spelled with an ea. 
Word hunts help students generalise what they are studying 
to other words. We recommend blind sorts at this stage, in 
which students sort words by sound as a partner reads them 
aloud, because students must not only distinguish the vowel 
sound but also associate it with a visual orthographic pattern. 
Do not assign blind sorts until after students have already had 
plenty of opportunities to sort and discuss the words. Games 
are an enjoyable way to practise reading the words and think-
ing about their patterns. Many games are described in the 
activities section at the end of this chapter, or can be adapted 
from games in the previous chapter.

Word Study for Transitional Learners in the Within Word Pattern Stage	
237
The three examples of introductory lessons that follow can serve as models for most of the 
sorts used in this stage.
Picture Sorts to Contrast Long and Short Vowels
Students in the early part of the within word pattern stage who still have problems distin-
guishing between spoken short and long vowel sounds benefit from a picture sort. Picture 
sorts develop phonemic awareness and focus attention on the sound without the support of 
the printed word. Use picture sorts for just one day and then follow up with word sorts. (CCSS 
Foundational Skills (1st) 2.c)
1.	 Use a prepared sort or select 10 to 14 pictures for one short vowel and its corresponding 
long vowel from the picture sets that come with this book. Arrange them in a template 
that students can later sort on their own or paste them on index cards for a group sort. 
Prepare headers such as “Short u” and “Long u” and decide on a picture that will be a key 
word. Headers such as cup and tube are good, are used in many sorts, and can be found on 
a sound board in Appendix B.
2.	 Set up the headers and explain to the students that they will be listening to the vowel 
sound in the middle of each word that names the pictures. Some words have the short-u 
sound, as in cup. (Isolate the vowel by peeling off the initial consonant and then the final 
consonant: cup, up, u). Some words will have the long-u sound, as in tube (tube, ube, oo–).
3.	 Model several pictures: “Here is a cube. Listen to the vowel: c-yooo
—-b. Will I put that under 
cup or tube? Yes, cube has the long vowel sound in the middle just like tube. They both have 
the /oo
—/ sound in the middle.” (Note that there is a slight difference between the long-u 
in tube (/oo
—/) and cube (/yoo
—/. The long-u sound seldom really “says its name” (“yoo
—”), 
except in a few words like cube, mule, use and huge. Adults tend to lump these variations 
together, but children can sometimes be more sensitive to the differences. They could be 
sorted into a different category but students should understand that both are long-u and 
both have the /oo
—/ sound.)
4.	 Have students sort the remaining pictures. Then check the sort by naming the pictures in 
each column and ask the students why they sorted as they did.
5.	 Give the students their own set of pictures to sort and observe them to see how accurately 
they sort. Do not expect students to spell these words because they have not been working 
with the printed forms.
Teacher-Directed Two-Step Sort for Long Vowels
One basic procedure is a two-step sort that begins with sound and moves to pattern. The following 
example is similar to the sort done by Ms. Watanabe, but contrasts short-a and long-a sounds and 
patterns. This teacher-directed sort starts with one set of words that everyone uses, after which 
students use their own sets at their seats. (CCSS Foundational Skills (1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b)
1.	 Use a prepared sort or create your own sort for students. You can find prepared sorts in 
Appendix D, on the Words Their Way PDToolkit, in the Words Their Way supplement, and 
in Word Study in Action materials for this stage.
To create your own sorts, use the word lists for this stage in Appendix E and select 
about seven short-a words, seven long-a words that are spelled with the CVVC pattern 
(rain, pail), and seven with the CVCe pattern (cake, tape). Include one or two oddballs that 
do not fit the expected sound or pattern (e.g., was or said). Use short-a and long-a pictures 
(e.g., cat and cake) as sound headers. Prepare word cards or write the words randomly on a 
word study handout template for students to cut apart.
2.	 Introduce the sort by reading the words together and talking about any whose meaning 
may be unclear. If there are homophones like tale and tail, talk about what each means. 
Invite students to make observations about the words: “What do you notice?”
3.	 Introduce the cat and cake key words for the sound sort. Say, “Listen to the vowel sound 
in the middle of cat. What vowel sound do you hear? Cat has a short-a.” Repeat with cake.

online.

CH AP TER 6
Then model how to sort a few words by the sound of the vowel in the middle and then 
ask the students to help you finish the sort. Warn them that there are a few oddballs with 
neither a short nor long vowel sound and challenge students to be on the lookout for 
them. As they are identified, set the oddballs off to the side. Read all the words in each 
column to check them and verify that they all have the same sound.
4.	 After discussing the two sound categories, ask students to look for patterns in the 
long-a column and separate them into two subcategories. Talk about how the words 
in each column have different spelling patterns and why the oddballs do not fit. Help 
students see that the words with a silent-e fit the CVCe pattern: a consonant, a vowel, 
another consonant and the silent-e. Repeat for the CVVC pattern and contrast with 
the CVC words in the short vowel category. Decide on key words for new headers 
from among the word cards and underline them or add labels for CVC, CVCe and 
CVVC.
5.	 Keep the headers in place and scramble the words to sort a second time. Do not make any 
corrections until the end. Check each column by reading the words and review how the 
words in each column are alike by sound and by pattern. If a mistake has been made, ask 
the students to find it. Talk about why the oddballs don’t fit and review the homophones 
once more. The final categories will look something like the following sort.
CVC
CVCe
CVVC
cat
cake
rain
was
gas
game
tail
said
back
lake
chain
has
cape
paint
camp
tale
pain
tack
trade
train
6.	 Students need their own sheet of words to cut apart and sort. Remind students to scribble 
on the back or draw three stripes in a colour they can recognise if they lose a word card. 
Some teachers ask older students to quickly initial each word card instead. Identify the 
headers and ask students to sort words while you observe. After sorting, check and reflect, 
and then ask students to shuffle the words and store them for activities on subsequent 
days.
Open Sorts
After students are familiar with listening for vowel sounds and looking for the patterns, chal-
lenge them with open-ended sorts. The open sort starts with everyone sorting their own set 
of words. Remind students to mark the back with an assigned colour or their initials so the 
words don’t get mixed up. (CCSS FS (1st) 2.c, (2nd) 3.b, (3rd) 3)
1.	 Use a prepared sort, or select about 20 words that are spelled with ir (bird ), ire ( fire) or 
ier (drier). Look for words that your students should already know how to read. You may 
also include one or two oddballs that have the same sound but not the same spelling pat-
tern or vice versa (e.g., fur and their). Write the words randomly on a word study handout 
template for students to cut apart.
2.	 Introduce the sort by reading the words together and talking about any whose meaning 
may be unclear or words that have multiple meanings. Then ask, “Can you figure out 
how to sort these words?” Invite students to make observations, discover the categories 
and find the oddballs. Call on different students to describe the rationale for their sorts. 
Accept all reasonable categories but come to an agreement about whether to sort by 
sounds or patterns or both.
3.	 Close the sort. Agree on key words and underline them to use as headers. Then ask all 
the students to sort the same way. The categories will look something like the following 
for Words Their Way®
Short -a and Long -a CVCe 
CVC -ai and -ay

second graders to sort words 
with long and short-a.

sort. Discuss the categories and oddballs with open-ended questions such as, “What do 
you notice about the words in each column?” Ask students to identify the homophones 
(fir and fur) and define or use them in sentences. See if anyone can find a word that has 
two meanings; for example, the word flier can refer to a person who flies an aeroplane or 
a printed ad.
bird
fire
drier
fir
swirl
wire
pliers
fur
first
chirp
tire
flier
their
dirt
skirt
hire

third

shirt

4.	 Help students summarise what they learned from the sort. Play What If. Ask students, 
“What if you were going to write the word conspire (a new word not included in the sort, 
but one that follows the same pattern)? How would you figure out how to spell it? What 
information that you learned from this sort might be helpful?” Shuffle and store the 
words for sorting activities on subsequent days.
Sequence and Pacing of Word Study in the  
Within Word Pattern Stage
The sequence of word study in the within word pattern stage begins by taking a step back with 
a review of short vowel sounds as they are compared with long vowel sounds in CVCe words. 
If students have not completely mastered short vowels they have another chance to study them 
in a different context. Then the focus shifts to other common and less-common long vowel 
patterns and r-influenced vowel patterns. Ambiguous vowels and complex consonant patterns 
are studied towards the end of the stage.
Early, Middle or Late Placement.  Identifying whether students are in the 
early, middle or late part of the stage (see Table 6.1, page 230) will help you target where in the 
sequence of features to begin word study instruction. After administering a spelling inventory, 
consider your students’ scores in the different categories of vowels.
Early.  In the early within word pattern stage, students know blends and digraphs and spell 
most short vowels correctly. They often experiment with silent letters that mark long vowels. 
The final silent-e is the most common pattern and the most likely to turn up first. Students 
might use it but confuse it when spelling short vowels ( job as JOBE) or long vowel patterns 
(FLOTE for float). If students spell fewer than two of the CVCe long vowels correctly, they 
are probably in the early part of the stage.
Middle.  By the middle of this stage, students are spelling the vowels with the CVCe pattern 
correctly but still make mistakes on the less-common long vowel patterns as well as other 
vowels such as r-influenced vowels and ambiguous vowels.
Late.  By the end of this stage, students will have mastered the long vowel patterns but will 
be making a few errors in the other vowels—r-influenced and ambiguous. They may also be 
missing some of the complex consonants studied in the late within word pattern stage.
Pacing.  Table 6.3 suggests contrasts and a sequence of word study under three possible 
pacing guides in the early, middle and late part of this stage. You can adjust pacing by adding 
more categories to a single sort (up to four or five) or by dropping back to fewer categories

when students are confused. Because there is a lot to cover in this stage, two years is not too 
long to address the range of features for students of average achievement.
Pacing depends on several factors: developmental level, grade level and rate of progress. 
For early within word pattern spellers in late first- or early second-grade, we recommend an 
introductory pace. Start with some picture sorts to focus attention on the different short and 
long vowel sounds and then study the common CVCe pattern across four long vowels (the 
CVCe pattern is not studied among long-e words because the CVCe pattern is rare in one-
syllable words). During this introductory pace, students may be using word study notebooks 
for the first time and learning new sorting routines.
If you teach students beyond the primary grades who are still in the early part of this 
stage, there is a greater sense of urgency to catch them up with peers. The moderate pace is a 
good place to start, but monitor progress through observation and assessments to determine 
whether to go faster or slower. The first few vowels may take more time than those studied 
later. Students in the middle within word pattern stage might benefit from the fast pace 
outlined in the last column of Table 6.3: a quick review of long vowels before going on to 
r-influenced and ambiguous vowels.
Many teachers are expected to use their school district’s adopted phonics or spelling pro-
gram and/or their district’s core reading program. Although these published programs may 
follow a developmental sequence similar to the one in Table 6.3, they often set a pace that is 
too fast for low-achieving students and do not supply enough practice to master the features. 
To differentiate instruction at students’ developmental levels, you must monitor progress and 
adjust the lessons by adding extra sorts for students who need a slower pace or skip some sorts 
to increase the pace when possible.
Keep in mind that studying vowel patterns in single-syllable words lays a critical founda-
tion for studying two-syllable words in the next stage and cannot be shortchanged. Perhaps 
25 percent of the adult population in the United States is stunted at this point of literacy pro-
ficiency. Even community college and university students who are poor spellers benefit from 
beginning their word study by reviewing vowel sounds and their spelling patterns (Massengill, 
2006). It is important to take a step back and conduct word study activities that help students 
cement their knowledge of vowel patterns in single-syllable words to get a running start as 
they study two-syllable words. For many of these students, the fast pace in the third column 
of Table 6.3 may be appropriate.
The Study of High-Frequency Words
A few spelling programs feature high-frequency or high-utility words. The authors of these 
programs argue that spelling instruction should focus on a small core of words students 
need the most, such as said, because, there, they’re, friend and again, and because such words 
are irregular they simply must be memorised. Unfortunately, this narrow view of word study 
ignores the relationship between reading and spelling, and it offers students no opportunity 
to form generalisations that can extend to reading and spelling of thousands of unstudied 
words.
There are high-frequency words that do not follow common spelling patterns, and they 
should be included in within word pattern sorts as oddballs. For example, said is usually 
examined with other words that have the ai pattern, such as paid, faint and wait. It becomes 
memorable because it stands alone in contrast to the many words that work as the pattern 
would suggest. Most students are likely to spell it correctly because they have seen it so 
often when they read. Note that most of the top 300 most-frequently occurring words in 
Appendix E (Dolch, 1942; Fry, 1980; Zeno, Ivens, Millard & Duvvuri, 1996) are covered by 
the end of the within word pattern stage. See page 390 for a list of high-frequency words 
compiled by Fry.
However, some words in English remain problematic for young writers. There are also 
some words that students need to write frequently in the lower grades that are not included in 
the weekly lessons designed to meet their developmental needs. An example is because, which 
occurs often in the writings of first-graders. Many teachers accept students’ inventions for 
such words (BECUZ, BECALZ, BECAWS), but some teachers grow tired of and concerned

about such errors, especially beyond the primary grades. Although we feel confident that such 
errors will be worked out over time with developmentally paced instruction, sometimes there 
are good reasons to address them sooner.
Some teachers study about five high-frequency words a week as part of the word wall 
activities described in Chapter 3 (Cunningham, 2012). An alternative is to have a week-long 
unit of high-frequency words several times a year. In either case, studying high-frequency 
words should not replace developmental word study by features, but rather should supplement 
such study. Choose just a few words that consist of the highly functional words seen in your 
students’ writing. The words should not be too far ahead of your students’ developmental 
levels. Post words that students need for short periods, of time such as Thanksgiving, leprechaun 
and tyrannosaurus, for easy reference; however, such words are not appropriate for students 
who are still learning to spell one-syllable words.
The following guidelines will help you plan the study of high-frequency words.
1.	 Select six to 10 words for one week of each nine-week period, for a total of 24 to 40 words 
a year. (Short weeks of two to three days might be good for these.) A list for a second-
grade class might include know, friend, again, our, went, would and once. Students can take 
part in the selection by choosing words they have difficulty spelling or by choosing words 
from your master list. Post a cumulative list of these words in alphabetical order in the 
room for reference, with the understanding that students are expected to spell those 
words correctly in all their written work once they have been studied. Create individual 
student copies of these words in alphabetical order; add to the list as words accumulate. 
Students may place the individual lists in their writing workshop folders or in a section 
of their word study notebooks.
2.	 Develop routines, such as the following, to help students examine and study the words 
carefully.
• Introduction and discussion.  As you write words on the board, the students copy them on 
their own paper in a column. (Be sure that everyone copies correctly!) Then lead a dis-
cussion about each word. “What part of this word do you already know how to spell?”

“What part of this word might be hard to remember and why?” (For friend, focus on 
the fact that it has a silent-i.) “What might help you remember how to spell this word?” 
(Students might note that it ends with end.)
• Self-corrected test method.  After the words are written and discussed, have students fold 
their paper over so that the list is covered. Call the words aloud while the students 
write them again; students then check their own work by unfolding the paper to com-
pare what they copied to what they spelled. Have students rewrite any words spelled 
incorrectly. The self-corrected test method to support memorisation has been well 
researched (Horn, 1954; Templeton & Morris, 2000).
• Self-study method.  The self-study method is a long-standing activity that appears in 
most published spelling programs. This process can be used independently after stu-
dents are taught the steps: (1) look at the word and say it; (2) cover the word; (3) write 
the word; (4) check the word; and (5) write the word again if it is spelled incorrectly.
• Practice test.  Call out and have students spell each word, and then immediately check 
it by looking at the chart posted in the room. Students become familiar with using the 
chart as a reference and can call the words to each other in pairs or small groups, or 
you may lead the practice test.
• Final test.  Cover the chart, and have students spell the words as you call out each one. 
Because the number of words is kept low, the chance of 100 percent success is high. 
Once students are tested they are responsible for those words from then on. You will 
undoubtedly need to remind students often to reread a piece of written work to check 
for the posted words in the editing stage. Students will have about eight weeks to work 
at getting any problematic words under control; any word that continues to be a prob-
lem can reappear on the next list.
Assess and Monitor Progress in the  
Within Word Pattern Stage
By the end of second grade, most students should be well into the middle of the within word 
pattern stage or beyond. Students who are not should be getting carefully planned systematic 
word study in supplemental interventions. There are several ways to monitor students’ prog-
ress in the within word pattern stage.
Weekly Spelling Tests
In this stage, we recommend weekly spelling tests as a way to both monitor progress and to 
make students accountable for their learning. Select ten words from the sort and call them 
out in a traditional way. Many teachers also call out one or two transfer words—words that fit 
the features but that were not included in the sort. Prompt students to use analogy by saying 
something like, “If you know how to spell rain, then you can spell stain.” When students are 
appropriately placed they should score 90 to 100 percent on these weekly assessments. If they 
do not, you should reconsider the placement or pacing of instruction. Also consider whether 
students are getting enough practice with the words across a week. We also recommend 
designing your weekly spelling test as a blind writing sort, having students sort the words as 
they write them. This rewards the kind of thinking about sound, pattern and meaning that is 
the whole point of word study. Give one point for the correct spelling and a second point for 
the correct grouping.
Unit Assessments and Goal Setting
Teachers often observe that students study for weekly tests and then forget the words when 
they need them for real writing (Gill & Scharer, 1996; Graham et al., 2008; Schlagal, 2013).

For this reason, we ­recommend periodic unit spell checks to determine whether the words and 
features are retained over time. Spell checks have been developed for each of the major units 
of study and can be found on the website and in Words Their Way®: Word Sorts for Within Word 
Pattern Spellers. You can easily create your own spell checks to use every three to six weeks by 
selecting words from the word sorts to assess retention of studied words and perhaps includ-
ing additional transfer words to see whether students can apply their growing knowledge of 
sounds and patterns to unstudied words. Use these spell checks to monitor progress and fine-
tune your instructional pacing. Depending on results, you may find you need to drop back to 
a slower pace or ratchet up to a quicker pace, as suggested in Table 6.3.
Students in the within word pattern stage can be involved in setting their own goals, using 
the forms described in Chapter 2 and available at the website. This is especially beneficial for 
older students who struggle with spelling and need to see their own progress.
Word Study with English Learners in the 
Within Word Pattern Stage
When planning word study with English learners it is important to know something about 
their native languages and what literacy experiences they have had. Students who are liter-
ate in their first language may spell the sounds they hear in English with the letter–sound 
correspondences they know from their first language, or if the sounds do not exist they will 
substitute close approximations. Knowing something about students’ native languages and 
writing systems is helpful so you can guide comparisons and understand the difficulties Eng-
lish learners face.
Teaching Vowels to English Learners
As hard as vowels are for English-speaking students, they can be truly challenging for English 
learners because many vowel sounds in English do not exist in other languages (Bear, Temple-
ton, Helman & Baren, 2003; Helman, 2004). Let’s use Spanish as an example because it is the 
second most commonly spoken language in the United States. Unlike English, Spanish vowels 
have only one sound for each letter. Some are the same as English, but others are different. 
For example, o and u represent long-o and long-u, as in uno. However, i represents the long-e 
sound (amigo) or si and e represents a sound that is close to long-a (tres, /tra-s/). The letter a is 
the only vowel in Spanish that is close to a short vowel sound in English: “ah” (/ö/) as in the 
vowel in hot. Table 6.4 shows some of the spelling errors students who are literate in Spanish 
might make, such as spelling job as JAB.
For students who have learned to spell in Spanish there will be some predictable confu-
sion with long vowels, such as using e for long-a (LEK for lake). Students literate in Spanish 
expect each vowel sound to be represented. What English speakers think of as a single long 
vowel is actually sometimes pronounced as a diphthong or glide, as in “pi-ee” (pie) or “lay-eek” 
(lake)—depending on one’s dialect. Spanish speakers may be more sensitive to these glides and 
attempt to spell both of the vowel sounds they hear. For example, when you pronounce the 
English long-i slowly, you can feel and hear how the long-i is a combination of the bottom 
vowel “ah” and the “ee” formed at the top of the mouth. The “ah” sound in English may be 
spelled with a short -o, but in Spanish, this sound is spelled with an a and the long-e sound 
is spelled with an i, so pie might be spelled PAI and night as NAIT. See Table 6.4 for more 
examples.
Other Romance languages, such as French, also represent long-a with e (tres) and long-e 
with i (merci). Four to five hundred years ago, English strayed from the original continental 
pronunciation of vowels and has, over time, changed or dropped the pronunciation of one 
vowel in combinations such as ai, oa, ea or ui, so that the second vowel is now silent.

Strategies for Teaching and Assessing English for  
English Learners
Some English learners can memorise many words, but their strategies for spelling unknown 
words often indicate that their orthographic knowledge could be deeper. For example, a stu-
dent memorised the spelling of rain but continued to spell unknown long-a words with an e 
(train as TREN), using the Spanish spelling of the long-a sound as in Table 6.4. The spelling 
errors in uncorrected writing and spelling inventories described in Chapter 2 reveal what 
word knowledge English learners bring to the task of reading and writing English.
There may be times when you want to assess students’ spelling development in their 
primary languages. Inventories for Spanish, Chinese and Korean are available in Words Their 
Way® with English Learners. These inventories will help you find out what students know 
about their own written language. The more literate students are in their first language, the 
more information there is to transfer to learning to read in English (Proctor, August, Carlo &  
Snow, 2006).
Word sorting lessons are an explicit way to draw English learners’ attention to both the 
similarities and differences between languages in terms of sounds and spelling, as well as help-
ing build vocabulary. The following suggestions can enhance the effectiveness of your word 
study with English learners:
• Search online resources to learn about similarities 
and differences in the sound and spelling systems of 
languages spoken by your students.
• Use concrete, highly imageable words that can easily 
be visualised, drawn or acted out—concrete nouns, 
imageable adjectives, action verbs. These words will 
be easier to learn than prepositions, conjunctions or 
helping verbs.
• Discuss the meanings of the words in the introductory 
lesson and review throughout the week as needed. Act 
out words when appropriate and supply photographs 
or drawings to develop meaning. Students can illus-
trate words in their word study notebooks or add 
a small drawing or definition to the word cards to 
remind them of meaning (see Figure 6.6).

• Reduce the number of words in a sort so students will not be overwhelmed with too many 
new vocabulary words. Spend extra time reading the words in columns aloud as students 
check their sorts.
• Pair words and pictures when possible. Long and short vowel pictures are included in the 
pictures that come with this book; more images can be downloaded from the Internet 
(e.g., Google images).
• Pair English learners with native English speakers who can supply pronunciations during 
partner sorts.
• Model careful pronunciation but do not be overly concerned if English learners do not 
master the correct pronunciations.

­English Learners.
Word Study Routines and Management
The within word pattern stage easily spans a number of grade levels, usually from first to 
fourth grade and beyond that for struggling students. A typical third-grade class will have 
students in the middle and late within word pattern stage, as well as students in the next 
stage, syllables and affixes. Differentiation occurs when students meet in small groups in 
which sorts are introduced and discussed under your guidance. However, after that, every-
one can engage in the same weekly routines described in Chapter 3 (blind sorts, writing 
sorts, word hunts, speed sorts, homework). Table 3.6 (page 82 in Chapter 3) shows a weekly 
schedule for students in the within word pattern stage, and Table 3.7 (page 83 in Chapter 3) 
offers a variation on this. Once students learn the schedule and the routines they can work 
independently, with partners or in small groups on most days of the week, freeing you to 
meet with instructional-level reading groups. As in the letter name–alphabetic stage, you 
might find that reading groups are usually the same as the word study groups.
Vocabulary instruction is usually not differentiated unless it involves words from 
the weekly sort or words that turn up in reading groups. Instead, vocabulary instruction 
usually takes place in whole-group settings, during read-alouds and during content area 
instruction.
Word Study Notebooks in the Within Word Pattern Stage
A word study notebook is an essential tool in the within word pattern stage, and provides an 
organisational structure and documentation of student work. It is used across the week for a 
number of activities (see Chapter 3) and students should have ready access to it throughout 
the day. Ask students to bring their notebook to small-group sessions, along with reading 
materials and response journals or logs. We recommend using sturdy stitched composition 
notebooks with a hard marbleised cover and dividing them into several sections set off with 
a tab or sticky note.
1.	 Students record their weekly sort, word hunt and other phonics or spelling activities in 
the word study section. Ask them to summarise what they learn from their sorts in their 
own words, as Araceli has done in Figure 6.7 She has numbered each column and written 
a generalisation for each, such as “Climb is the same as bind, wind and hind.” These written 
reflections help you assess students’ progress.
2.	 Students record words from their reading or from content area instruction in the vocabu-
lary section. For example, when reading Stuart Little encourage students to make lists of 
boat terms (rigging, bow, stern) or weather-related words (squall, breeze, mist). These words 
can be shared and then combined and sorted into semantic categories or added, where 
possible, to the spelling sorts (e.g., add breeze to a long-e category of ee patterns). Students

might create a science web on pandas, make a list of concepts related to immigration, or 
compare and contrast geometric terms.
3.	 A third section might be an ongoing list of homophones, homographs and polysemous 
(multiple meaning) words, with sentences or pictures to illustrate the different meanings 
of the words.
Word Hunts
To help students see the connection between word study and reading, ask them to go through 
what they have recently read to find words that fit the particular sound or pattern they are 
studying. The common vowel patterns turn up frequently in most reading materials, but you 
may also find decodable text or phonics readers that focus on a particular pattern useful for 
word hunts. Although word sorts are usually limited to one-syllable words in this stage, two- 
and three-syllable words are welcome additions in a word hunt (e.g., ai in rainbow or painted). 
Such words often extend generalisations into more difficult vocabulary as well as offer oppor-
tunities for applying knowledge of vowel patterns to the decoding of longer words in texts. 
Record word hunt results on charts and/or in word study notebooks. In addition, challenge 
students to always be on the lookout for new words that they might add to earlier sorts. In this 
way, sounds and patterns are constantly revisited.
Homework
In Figure 3.24 in Chapter 3, there is a letter for parents describing homework routines for 
each day of the week. These routines are especially appropriate for within word pattern 
spellers for whom homework will provide much needed extra practice. You can send home a 
FIGURE 6.7   A Page from Araceli’s Word Study Notebook

checklist, such as the one in Figure 3.22 (Chapter 3), with an extra copy of the words for the 
week; place everything in an envelope or plastic zip bag. Allow students to choose two or three 
activities, and more options can be added to the checklist occasionally, such as using a small 
number of words in sentences.
Resources for Implementing 
Word Study in Your Classroom
There are a number of materials available to help you 
implement word study with students in the within word 
pattern stage.
• Suggested sorts in Appendix D can be used with the 
template on page 425, and the word lists in Appen-
dix E can be used to create your own sorts.
• Prepared sorts, spell checks and games are available 
on the PDToolkit. With the Create Your Own feature 
you can make your own sorts.
• Words Their Way®: Word Sorts for Within Word Pattern 
Spellers provides a complete curriculum of sorts 
divided into ten units. The spell checks that are 
supplied for each unit can be used for pretesting to 
better identify what students are ready to study and 
for post-testing to monitor progress.
Several vocabulary activities are described first in this section followed by some dictionary 
activities. The remaining games and activities are designed to extend and reinforce spelling 
sorts. Common Core State Standards for Foundational Skills and Language are listed for 
grades 1, 2 and 3.
Vocabulary Activities
Refer back to vocabulary activities in Chapter 5 (5.1 to 5.5) that are also appropriate for this 
stage.
	 6.1 	 Concept Sort for Math
Concept sorts are an excellent way for students to work with vocabulary related to units of 
study. In this example, students categorise terms related to addition and subtraction that they 
are likely to encounter in word problems. (CCSS Language (1st) 5.a, 5.c, (3rd) 6)
Materials  Prepare a set of word cards with the terms to sort on the front and sample 
word problems on the back using the terms. For example, “Take away. If I have three books 
and you take away two how many will I have?” If you want students to work with these terms 
individually, use a blank template and write the terms in the boxes in random order. Set off 
the headers in bold or underline.
Procedures
1.	Remind students that there are many words that mean the same thing as “add” and “sub-
tract” and that these words will show up in written word problems.
2.	Set up the headers Add and Subtract. Introduce each new term in a simple problem sen-
tence. “Lost. I had 10 pencils and I lost three so how many do I have left?” Or “Difference.

3.	Continue to sort all the terms, discussing where the terms should go and why. The final sort 
will look something like the following set of lists. Put the words in a student activity centre

4.	Challenge students to write their own word problems using the terms.
Variations  You can add terms for multiplication and division. Many content area terms 
and concepts can be sorted in a similar manner. Simply write words into a template or onto 
cards, draw a simple figure or use an online search engine to find pictures and 
images you can download. Use both pictures and words when appropriate.

	 6.2 	 Semantic Brainstorms
This small-group activity focuses on the meanings of the words and serves as a great activity 
for content studies. (CCSS Language (1st) 5.a, 5.c, 6, (2nd) 6, (3rd) 6)
Procedures
1.	Choose a topic related to an area of study. Start with easy, familiar topics such as sports 
(or countries, animal life, clothes, furniture or modes of transportation).
2.	Have students brainstorm related words and then record them using chart paper or an 
interactive whiteboard.
3.	Ask students to share their findings and see whether they can come up with subcategories 
from their brainstorming. Categories can be circled by colour or written over into columns.
Variations  Look in magazines, newspapers and catalogues. Circle words that express 
feelings, colours, people’s names or parts of speech. Use organising software to record these 
brainstorms electronically, to be moved about on an interactive white board; use software for 
drawing graphics the same way. You can record student responses within circles and rectangles 
using the drawing toolbar in PowerPoint software.

	 6.3 	 Semantic Sorts
Students work with content-related words to compare and contrast. In Figure 6.9, terms 
related to bees have been sorted into categories. (CCSS Language (1st) 5.a, 5.c, 6, (2nd) 6, 
(3rd) 6)
Procedures
1.	Look through a chapter or unit in a textbook and make a list of the key terms; they are 
often listed at the end of a unit. Make word cards for the words or fill in a template such 
as the one in appendix F.
2.	Have students work alone or with partners to sort the words in an open sort, establish-
ing their own categories. Then bring everyone together to compare and defend their 
­groupings.
3.	When doing a sort to introduce a unit of study, do not evaluate student groupings as 
right or wrong. Let disagreements or errors be the basis for questions to be answered 
with further study. For example, students might logically put royal jelly under “benefits” 
of honeybees. Rather than telling them where it should go, say something like, “I see that 
there is some disagreement about where to put royal jelly. As we read about honeybees we 
will pay special attention to this term.”
4.	Have students sort words again after a unit of study is finished. They can copy the sorts 
into word study notebooks in a separate section for that content area, and be used as one 
way to evaluate student learning.
	 6.4 	 Shades of Meaning
This small-group activity focuses on the nuances of meaning among words in the same 
semantic category. It is useful for nurturing word consciousness in writing as well as reading. 
The activity focuses on the discussion and not on whether the order is right or wrong. (CCSS 
Language (1st) 5.a, 5.c, 5.9, 6, (2nd) 5.b, 6, (3rd) 5.c, 6)

activities | Within Word Pattern Stage
Procedures
1.	Choose a vocabulary word that is essential to understanding a particular book or topic of 
study. For example, you might choose stampede from Scieszka’s The Good, the Bad, and the 
Goofy, because this term describes so much of the action in this book.
2.	Come up with other words that are similar to a stampede (noun): a charge, rush, flight, mad 
dash and so on. Students can also contribute words.
3.	Have students place the words along a continuum of strength (move, rush, flight, mad 
dash, charge, stampede) and then discuss the reasoning for their arrangement. Students 
might say that a charge is more forceful than a rush, or a stampede is even stronger than 
a charge.
	 6.5 	 “Said Is Dead” and “Good-Bye Good”
As students increase their writing fluency their word choices should reflect a more extensive 
and vivid vocabulary. These two activities are frequently used across the grades to help stu-
dents add spice to their writing. (CCSS Language (1st) 5.a, 5.d, 6, (2nd) 5.b, 6, (3rd) 3.a, 6)
Materials  You will need a thesaurus for every small group, as well as chart paper, a pro-
jector and models of either exemplary or tired writing. Some teachers use chart paper cut in 
the shape of a headstone. You can find prepared posters of “Said Is dead” and other word lists 
online but it is better to have students create their own and add to them.
Procedures
1.	Begin with a piece of writing (a student sample or something that you create) and project 
it for all to see. Look through the selection for overused words, such as the verb said or 
the adjective good. Then project a piece of literature with a variety of words for contrast.
2.	Create a vocabulary chart that students may use for their own writing and brainstorm 
other words to use in place of said or good. Students can refer to a thesaurus for related 
words. Post the chart where students can refer to it and continue to add to it over time.  
A brief list of words developed by students to replace said might include the following:
yelled	
declared	
laughed	
ordered	
scolded
remarked	
screamed	
blurted	
demanded	
argued
exclaimed	
cried	
boasted

Spelling Strategies and Dictionary Skills
	 6.6 	 Have-a-Go Sheets
Asking students to try spelling a word several ways is an important strategy since identifying 
the vowel sound and then thinking of different possible patterns is one of the key goals of 
instruction in the within word pattern stage. (CCSS Language (1st) 2.e. (2nd) 2.d, (3rd) 2.f)
Materials  Prepare blank forms like the one in Figure 6.10. While these forms are not 
necessary—students can write the word in the margin of their paper or on a scrap of paper—
they help when first introducing the strategy to students. Keeping a special form in a writing 
folder can serve as a reminder and also a record of a student’s efforts.

	 252	
CH AP TER 6
activities | Within Word Pattern Stage
Procedures
1.	Students can use the Have-a-Go sheets any time they are writing, and keep them in their 
writing folders. However, the sheets might be used specifically when students are editing 
pieces that will be taken to a finished state.
2.	Expect students to make two attempts to spell a word they need and consider which one 
might “look right”. Only then can they go to you to ask for help.
3.	You can then see where the students need assistance, compliment them on what they fig-
ured out, and make suggestions about what else is needed, or even confirm that they got 
it right! Figure 6.10 contains examples of the kinds of feedback you can use.
	 6.7 	 Dictionary Skills for Within Word Pattern Spellers
During the within word pattern stage, students can learn some essential dictionary skills and 
begin to use simplified dictionaries to look up the meanings of words. (CCSS L (2nd) 4.e, 
(3rd) 4.d)
Materials  You will need beginning dictionaries or elementary dictionaries that are 
best for students first learning to look up words. These look like traditional dictionaries but 
include the most common words with brief entries. However, they are not as limited as the 
picture dictionaries described in Chapter 5. If you do not have sets available in your classroom 
check with your school librarian, who might have sets that you can borrow. We recommend 
the following:
DK Children’s Illustrated Dictionary (2009)
Merriam-Webster Children’s Dictionary
Scholastic Dictionary of Spelling
Procedures
1.	Teach alphabetical order up to the second or third letter. Occasionally ask students to put 
their word sort for the week into alphabetical order before copying it down in their word 
study notebooks. To start, supply students with an alphabet strip to use as a guide and 
only require alphabetising by the first letter. Next, take away the strip and then move on 
to using the second and even third letter to put words in order.
2.	To help with dictionary searches, divide up the alphabet into early, middle and late sec-
tions so students develop a sense of where a letter appears in the alphabetical sequence.

activities | Within Word Pattern Stage
Divide an alphabet strip into thirds then model how to think about where a letter falls 
(e.g., “The letter N come close to M so I know it is in the middle”). You can ask stu-
dents to sort their weekly words into thirds by setting up headers such as A–G, H–R 
and S–Z.
3.	Teach students to use guide words. Once students can alphabetise to two or three places, 
you can introduce the guide words at the top of the dictionary page that will help them 
narrow down the location of a word. Begin with lots of modelling and think-alouds as you 
do this using your own dictionary.
4.	Teach students how to interpret definitions. Project a page of a dictionary and point out 
the bolded entries and the kinds of information they can find. Of particular interest at 
the within word pattern stage are the multiple meanings of even simple words like beat, 
track or lodge. When introducing the words in the sort for the week you might ask several 
students to look up the definition(s) of selected words and to be ready to report to the 
group on their findings.
5.	Model at every opportunity. You may find that a beginning dictionary is somewhat limited 
and you need to use a more advanced dictionary. Think out loud as you use the dictionary: 
“If I want to look up contagious I first need to figure out the first few letters—con—I think 
that would be C-O-N. C comes early in the alphabet so I will open the dictionary to the 
beginning and flip to the C pages. Now to find some C-O words using the guide words 
at the top of the page. . . .”
	 6.8 	 Dictionary Scavenger Hunts and How Many Turns
As you teach basic dictionary skills, you can conduct scavenger hunt type activities for just a 
few moments each day by asking students to get out dictionaries and find words as quickly 
as possible. Students can also do this in small groups or with partners, taking turns naming 
words to find and keep track of the time or the number of pages they turn. (CCSS Language 
(2nd) 4.e, (3rd) 4.d)
Materials  Students should all have similar dictionaries appropriate for primary or 
elementary grades.
Procedures
1.	Call out a word and write it for all to see. When appropriate, prompt students to consider 
the first and second letter (start with single consonants), to think about where to look in 
the dictionary (early middle late), and to use guidewords.
2.	Challenge students to count the number of times they need to turn a page to find the 
word. De-emphasise competition, but winners might be allowed to call out the next word.
Spelling Games and Activities
Many games from the previous chapter can be used with the features covered in this stage. 
Look for Match, Go Fish, Making Words With Cubes and Follow the Path Spelling Game. The 
Adaptable for Other Stages logo in each chapter indicates games that work for a variety of 
features and stages.
	 6.9 	 Word-O or Word Operations
Students can complete this activity in their word study notebooks. It is especially appropriate 
for the within word pattern stage because it shows students how analogy can help them spell. 
(CCSS Language (1st) 2.d, (2nd) 2.d, (3rd) 2.f)
Procedures  Give students a word (such as cart) and then ask them to add, drop or 
change one or two letters at a time to create a new word. Typically consonants, blends and 
digraphs are exchanged at the beginning (part, chart, smart) or the end (card), but vowels can

	6.10 	 Train Station Game
Use this board game to emphasise automaticity with common long vowels. (CCSS Language 
(1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, (3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  Use a basic follow-the-path board found in Appendix F, decorated as in 
­Figure 6.11. Write in words that students have studied in word sorts as well as words that share 
the same feature. Incorporate four special squares into the game board: (1) Cow on the track. 
Lose 1 turn. (2) You pass a freight train. Move ahead 2 spaces. (3) Tunnel blocked. Go back 1 
space. (4) You lost your ticket. Go back 2 spaces.
Procedures  This game can be played with up to four students. Each student selects a 
game piece. The first student then spins or rolls the die and moves the appropriate number 
of spaces. Students pronounce the word they land on and identify the vowel. If students 
have studied the long vowel pattern within each long vowel, ask them to say the pattern. For 
example, “Nail is a long-a with a CVVC pattern.” In addition, students must say another word 
containing the same vowel sound to stay on that space. Play continues in this fashion until 
someone reaches the station.
Variations  Divide a spinner into five sections and label each with a vowel. Students 
move to the next word with the vowel sound they spin.

	6.11 	 Turkey Feathers
In this game, two players compare patterns 
across a single long vowel. (CCSS Language 
(1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, (3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  You will need two paper or 
cardboard turkeys without tail feathers (see 
Figure 6.12), 10 construction paper feathers, 
and at least 20 word cards representing the 
long vowel (e.g., for long-a: a-e, ai and ay).
Procedures
1.	One player shuffles and deals five cards 
and five feathers to each player. The 
remaining cards are placed face-down 
for the draw pile.
2.	Each player puts down pairs that match 
by pattern. For example, cake/lane is a 
pair, but pain/lane is not. Each time a pair 
is laid down, the player puts one feather on his or her turkey.
3.	The dealer goes first, saying a word from his or her hand, and asks if the second player 
has a card with the same pattern.
4.	If the second player has a matching pattern, the first player gets the card and lays down 
the pair and a feather; if not, the first player draws a card. If the player draws a card that 
matches any word in his or her hand, the pair can be discarded, and a feather is earned. 
The next player proceeds in the same manner.
5.	The player using all five feathers first wins. If a player uses all the cards before earning five 
feathers, the player must draw a card before the other player’s turn.
	6.12 	 The Racetrack Game
Darrell Morris (1982) developed this game, which has become a classic. It can be used for 
any vowel pattern and serves as a good review of the many patterns for the different vowels. 
(CCSS Language (1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, (3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  This game, for two to four players, is played on an oval race track divided into 
20 to 30 spaces, which you can find in Appendix F and on the website (see Figure 6.13 for an 
example). Different words following particular patterns are written into each space, except for a 
star drawn in two spaces. For example, you can use night, light, tie, kite, like, my, fly, wish and dig on a 
game designed to practise patterns for long- and short-i. Prepare a collection of 40 to 50 cards that 
share the same patterns. A number spinner or a single die is used to move players around the track.
Procedures
1.	Designate one player as the dealer, who shuffles the word cards and deals six to each 
player; the remaining cards are turned face-down to become the deck. Playing pieces are 
moved according to the number on the spinner or die.
2.	When players land on a space, they read the word and then look for words in their hands 
that have the same pattern. For example, a player who lands on night may pull sign and 
right to put in his or her point pile. If players move to a space with a star, they dispose of 
any oddballs they might have (such as give) or choose their own pattern.
3.	Any cards played are replaced by drawing from the deck. A player who has no match for 
the pattern must draw a card anyway.
4.	The game is over when there are no more cards to play. The winner is the player who has 
put down the most word cards.

	6.13 	 The Spelling Game
This game for two to four players can be used for any feature and is easily changed from week 
to week by simply replacing the word cards. (CCSS Language (1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, 
(3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  Use a follow-the-path game board, but leave the spaces blank, except for 
several spaces where you may write directions such as Go Back 3 Spaces, Lose a Turn and Go 
Ahead 2 Spaces. Add playing pieces and a spinner or die. Students use their own collections 
of words for the week.
Procedures
1.	Students each roll the die or spin the spinner. Whoever has the highest number will start 
and play proceeds clockwise.
2.	The second player draws from the face-down stack of word cards. The player says the 
word to the first player, who must spell the word aloud. If players spell correctly, they can 
spin or roll to move around the path. Players who misspell the word cannot move.
3.	The winner is the first one to get to the end of the path by landing on the space.
Variations  Use this game with word families, short vowels and multisyllabic words, as 
well as the many one-syllable words explored in the within word pattern stage. You can also 
ask students to spell words on a dry erase board before claiming their space.
	6.14 	 “I’m Out”
This card game is a favourite for two to five players; three is optimal. (CCSS Language (1st) 
2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, (3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  Prepare a set of 20 to 30 cards from a study unit, such as words with a, a-e, ay 
and ai. Write the words at the top of cards for easy visibility as students fan them out in their 
hands. Students can also simply use the words they cut out for sorting.

activities | Within Word Pattern Stage
Procedures
1.	Select one student to be the dealer, who deals all the cards so that each player gets the 
same number. The person to the right of the dealer begins.
2.	The first player places a card down, reads the word and designates the vowel pattern to 
be followed—for example, rain–ai.
3.	The next player must place a card down with the ai pattern and read it aloud. A player who 
does not have a word with the ai pattern or reads a word incorrectly must pass.
4.	Play continues around the circle until all of the players are out of the designated pattern.
5.	The player who played the last pattern card begins the new round. This player chooses a 
different card, places it in the middle and declares what vowel pattern is to be followed.
6.	The object of the game is to be the first player to play every card in his or her hand.
	6.15 	 Vowel Spin
Players spin for a feature (vowel sounds or vowel pattern) and remove pictures or words from 
their game boards that match the feature. (CCSS Language (1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, (3rd) 
2.f, 3)
Materials  Make game boards divided like Tic-Tac-Toe, as shown in Figure 6.14. The 
game can be played without the board by simply laying out the word cards in a three-by-three 
array. Make 30 or more word cards or picture cards that correspond to the feature students 
have been studying. You will also need a spinner divided into three to six sections and labelled 
with the vowel sounds or patterns to be practised. You can find directions for making a spin-
ner in Appendix F.
Procedures
1.	Put the cards in a deck face-down. Players draw nine cards and turn them face-up on their 
boards or in a three-by-three array.
2.	The first player spins and removes the picture or word cards that fit the sound or pattern 
indicated by the spinner. The cards go into the player’s point pile. That same player draws

activities | Within Word Pattern Stage
enough cards from the deck to replace the gaps on the playing board before play moves 
to the next player.
3.	Play continues until a player is out of cards and there are no more to be drawn as replace-
ments. The player who has the most cards in his or her point pile wins.
Variations  Players prepare boards as described, but turn a winning card face-down as 
in a tic-tac-toe game instead of removing it. The winner is the first player to turn down three 
in a row. Blackout is a longer version, where players must turn over all their cards to win. A 
large die (one-inch square) can be made instead of a spinner. Use sticky dots to label the sides 
with the different features.
	6.16 	 Vowel Concentration
This game is played the traditional way, but students look for pairs of words with the same 
sound and pattern. (CCSS Language (1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, (3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  Prepare a set of word cards for a particular vowel pattern. Students can 
use the set of words they cut out for the week but they should not be able to read the word 
through the back of the card. Remove oddballs since they are not likely to make a pair.
Procedures
1.	Players turn all the words face-down in a rectangular array.
2.	The first player turns over two word cards. If they have the same vowel sound and pattern 
(such as fort and north), the player keeps both cards and adds them to the point pile. The 
player can take another turn before play passes to the next player.
3.	The game ends when all matches have been made. The winner is the player with the most 
word cards in the point pile.

activities | Within Word Pattern Stage
Materials  Prepare a game board using a follow-the-path template, as shown in 
­Figure 6.15. Write long-e words from the book as well as other words with the same patterns 
in each space. You will need a spinner with numbers 1 through 4 (see directions for spinners in 
Appendix F), playing pieces to move around the board, and a pencil and small piece of paper 
for each player.
Procedures  One player spins and moves that number of spaces on the board. The 
player reads the word on the space and “adds a sheep to the jeep” by saying or writing a word 
that rhymes with that word. A player who reads the word incorrectly must move back a space. 
Players alternate turns. The first player to the finish wins.
	6.18 	 Jeopardy Game
In this game, four or five students recall and spell words that follow a particular pattern; for 
example, the final ch pattern. (CCSS L (1st) 2.c, 3.c (2nd) 3.a, 3.b (3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  Divide a poster board into 5-by-5-inch sections, as shown in Figure 6.16, and 
place clue cards in each space. The side of each card facing down holds a clue about a word in 
that category (with the answer); the side facing up shows an amount (100 to 400).
Procedures
1.	One player is the moderator or game host. The others roll a die to determine who goes 
first.
2.	The game begins when the first player picks a category and an amount for the mod-
erator to read (“I’ll take short vowels for 100”). The moderator reads the clue and the

player must respond by phrasing a question and spelling the word, as in the following 
example.
Moderator: When struck, it produces fire.
Player: What is a match? M-a-t-c-h.
3.	If the answer is correct, the player receives the card and chooses another clue. (A player 
can only have two consecutive turns.) If the player misses, the player to the left may 
answer.
4.	The game continues until all the clue cards are read and won or left unanswered. Players 
add their points, and the one with the highest amount wins.

	6.19 	 Vowel Rummy Card Game
Up to four students practise grouping short and long vowel words by pattern. (CCSS Lan-
guage (1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, (3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  You need 35 to 45 cards. A good starting combination is five cards for each 
short vowel in the CVC pattern for a total of 25 cards, plus five cards for each long vowel in 
the CVCe pattern (except for long-e because there are so few words in that category) for a 
total of 20 more cards. You can also include wild cards.
Procedures
1.	Five cards are dealt to each player and the rest are turned face-down in a deck. Players 
look in their hands for pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind or five of a kind.
2.	Each player has one chance to discard unwanted cards and draw up to four new cards from 
the deck to keep a hand of five cards. For example, a player might be dealt bone, rope, that, 
wet, rake. This player may want to discard that, wet and rake, and draw three other cards 
to possibly create a better hand.
3.	The possible combinations are one pair (that, camp); two pairs (that, camp, bone, rope); three 
of a kind (bone, rope, rode); four of a kind (bone, rope, rode, smoke); three of a kind plus a pair 
(bone, rope, rode, hat, rat); or five of a kind.
4.	Players lay down their hands to determine the winner of the round. The winner is deter-
mined in this order: Five of a kind (this beats everything), four of a kind, three of a kind 
plus a pair, two pairs, three of a kind and finally one pair. In the case of a tie, players can 
draw from the deck until one player comes up with a card that breaks the tie.
5.	Play continues by dealing another set of cards to the players. The player who wins the 
most rounds is the winner.
	6.20 	 Declare Your Category!
This game for two to five players (three is optimal) works best with students who have some 
experience playing games. In this game, players guess the first player’s category. (CCSS Lan-
guage (1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, (3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  Create a deck of 45 word cards with a variety of vowels and vowel patterns. 
Make at least four cards with any one pattern.

Procedures
1.	Seven cards are dealt to each player and the remainder are placed face-down in a deck. 
Players lay out their seven cards face-up.
2.	The first player turns up a key card from the deck (e.g., home) and looks for a word in his 
or her hand to match in some way. It might have the same sound and/or spelling pattern 
(either o-e or VCe); for example, soap, bone or gave. The match is laid down for all to see 
and the player announces, “Guess my category.” Play moves to the next person, who must 
search his or her hand for a similar match. Players can pass when they wish. The player 
who started the category keeps the sorting strategy a secret. Play keeps going until the last 
player to put a card down declares the category.
3.	If the person who set up the category does not think the next player has put down an 
acceptable card, he or she can send a card back and give that player another chance. Mis-
takes are discussed at the end of each round.
4.	The player who plays the last card has to declare the category to win and keep all the 
cards. If the player is wrong, the previous player gets a chance to declare the category.
5.	At the end of each round, students are dealt enough cards to get them back to seven. The 
winner of the round turns up a card from the pile and makes up the next category.
6.	Play continues until the deck is empty. The player with the most cards wins.
Variations  Add wild cards to the pile to change categories in midstream. The per-
son who establishes a new category must guess the original category correctly. This player 
becomes the new judge: “Your category was by words with long-o and the silent-e. I am put-
ting down my wild card and laying down loan. Guess my category.” The rules of the game can 
be expanded to include semantic (e.g., types of birds) and grammatical (e.g., nouns) categories.
	6.21 	 Word Categories
This is a fast moving game for three to five players 
that reviews vowels as players brainstorm words that 
match a given pattern. Players only earn points when 
their word is different from everyone else’s. (CCSS 
Language (1st) 2.d, (2nd) 2.9, 2.e, (3rd) 2.f)
Materials  Players will need a timer, pencils and 
enough game cards for every player. See a completed 
sample in Figure 6.17. Blank forms can be found at the 
PDToolkit.
Procedures
1.	The game is played in three rounds. Each player 
has a Categories game card.
2.	Set the timer for one minute (adjust as needed). All 
players quickly fill in the first column of their answer 
sheet, adding beginning sounds to the given patterns 
to create a word. Answers must be real words.
3.	Scoring: Players take turns reading their answers aloud for each number. Players circle 
answers that do not match any other player’s answer and earn one point for each. Record 
the score at the bottom of the column of the answer sheet as shown in Figure 6.17.
4.	Reset the timer to start the second, and then third, round. Students continue playing, fill-
ing in the next column with new answers.
5.	Winning the game: After three rounds, players total the three scores on their answer 
sheets. The player with the highest score is the winner.
6.	Challenging another player’s answers: While answers are read, other players may chal-
lenge their acceptability. In this case, they can consult the dictionary to determine whether 
or not the word is real.

	6.22 	 Word Study Uno
This game is a version of the popular card game for three to four players created by Rita 
Loyacono. (CCSS Language (1st) 2.c, 3.c, (2nd) 3.a, 3.b, (3rd) 2.f, 3)
Materials  Create a set of at least 27 word cards by writing words in the upper left 
­corners of tagboard rectangles or blank cards. Include the patterns that you have been 
studying. For example, if students are studying long-o patterns, create word cards that have 
o-e, oa and ow combinations. Also create four Wild cards and two of each of the following 
cards:
Skip o-e	
Draw 2 o-e
Skip ow	
Draw 2 ow
Skip oa	
Draw 2 oa
Procedures
1.	Deal five cards to each player. The remaining cards are placed in a deck face-down and 
the top card is turned face-up to start the discard pile.
2.	Players take turns playing cards that match the pattern of the face-up card or play one of 
the special cards (Skip, Draw 2, Wild). For example, if the beginning card is boat, the first 
player could put down soap, road or goat, or play a special card. The Skip card indicates 
that the next player loses a turn. The Draw 2 card forces the next player to pick two cards 
from the pile without playing any cards.
3.	Skip and Draw 2 cards indicate the next pattern that must be played. When a Wild card 
is played, the player can select the category. A player who cannot put down a card must 
draw from the pile, and if the draw matches the pattern of the face-up card, it can be 
played.
4.	A player who has only one card remaining must yell, “Uno”. If the player forgets, another 
player can tell the player with one card to draw another card.
5.	The first player to run out of cards wins the game.
	6.23 	 Homophone Win, Lose or Draw
Four or more students work in teams to draw and guess each other’s words in a game that 
resembles charades; a list of homophones can be found in Appendix E. (CCSS Language (2nd) 
5, (3rd) 5, (4th) 1.g, 5, (5th) 5)
Procedures
1.	Write homophone pairs on cards and shuffle.
2.	Students divide into two equal teams, and one player from each team is selected as the art-
ist for that round. The artist must draw a picture representing a given homophone, which 
requires understanding a homophone’s spelling and meaning.
3.	A card is pulled from the deck and shown simultaneously to the artists for both teams. 
As the artists draw, their teammates call out possible answers. When the correct word is 
offered, the artist calls on that team to spell both words in the pair.
4.	A point is awarded to the team that provides the correct information first. The artist then 
chooses the next artist and play proceeds in the same fashion.
	6.24 	 Homophone Rummy
This activity is suitable for two to six students. The object of the game is to get the most 
homophone pairs. (CCSS Language (2nd) 5, (3rd) 5, (4th) 1.g, 5, (5th) 5)
Materials  Prepare several decks of homophone pairs (52 cards, 26 pairs); a list of homo-
phones can be found in Appendix E. Select words your students are familiar with. Write the 
words in the upper left corner of the cards, as shown in Figure 6.18.

activities | Within Word Pattern Stage
Procedures
1.	Players are dealt seven cards and begin the game by 
­checking their hands for already existing pairs. Pairs can be 
laid down in front of the player, who must give the mean-
ing for each word or use it in a sentence that makes the 
meaning clear.
2.	The remainder of the deck is placed in a central location 
and the first card is turned face-up beside it to form a dis-
card pile.
3.	The person on the left of the dealer goes first. Each player 
draws from either the deck or the discard pile. Any new 
pairs are laid down and defined. The player must then dis-
card one card to end the turn. Note: If a card is taken from 
the discard pile, all the cards below are also taken and the 
top card must be used to make a pair.
4.	A player can be challenged by another player who disagrees 
with the definitions. The person who challenges looks up 
the words in the dictionary. Whoever is right gets to keep 
the pair.
5.	The game is over when one player has no cards left. That person yells, “Rummy!” Then 
the pairs are counted up to determine the winner.
	6.25 	 Hink Pinks
Hink Pinks is a traditional language game that involves a riddle answered by a pair of rhyming 
words; for example, “What do you call a chubby kitty or an obese feline? (fat cat). What do you 
call an angry father? (mad dad). What do you call a plastic pond? (fake lake).” Hinky Pinky usu-
ally demands two-syllable rhymes: What is a bloody tale? (gory story), whereas Hinkety Pinkety 
requires three-syllable answers: What is the White House? (presidents’  
residence). You can find lots more examples by searching online. Visual hink 
pinks are featured in the book One Sun: A Book of Terse Verse, by Bruce 
McMillan. (CCSS Language (4th) 5, (5th) 5)
Procedures
1.	Share examples of hink pinks and discuss the structure of the language 
or read One Sun with your students and talk about the riddles and 
photographs.
2.	Brainstorm objects and possible adjectives that rhyme; for example, 
pink/sink, bear/lair, sled/bed. When students understand the concept, 
have them work in small groups or individually to think of their own 
hink pinks.
3.	Challenge students to draw a picture to illustrate their hink pink 
(see Figure 6.19) or to write a riddle. These can be exchanged with a 
­classmate.

The Syllables and Affixes Stage

B
eginning in second or third grade for many students, and in fourth grade for most, cognitive and lan-
guage growth supports movement into the syllables and affixes stage of word knowledge. Although 
students have been reading and writing words of more than one syllable for some time, it is during 
this stage that they systematically study the generalisations that govern how syllables are joined. And though 
they might have studied how affixes (both prefixes such as re- or un- and suffixes such as -ing or -ly) affect 
word meaning, it is during this stage that students also look at how suffixes might affect the spelling of the 
base word. Examining how affixes and base words combine supports students learning how to figure out the 
meaning of many longer, unfamiliar words they encounter in their reading.
Many teachers find that there is much about the English writing system or orthography at this stage 
that is new to them as well as to their students. Your own curiosity about words and a willingness to dig 
deeper into the way words work will enable you to learn right along with your students. This chapter and 
supporting material will help you facilitate students’ word explorations to help them discover the patterns 
of sound, spelling and meaning that link thousands of words. This knowledge will help them read, write and 
spell more effectively.
Before we talk in detail about the features of study in this stage, let’s visit Sharon Radcliffe’s fourth-grade classroom 
in mid-year. Ms. Radcliffe has a range of abilities in her classroom that are evident in both reading levels and spell-
ing inventory results. She has a large group of 14 students who fall into the syllables and affixes stage, four students 
in the late within word pattern stage, and five students who are in derivational relations. She makes time to meet 
with each group several times a week for systematic word study while the other groups work independently. In the 
following vignette, Ms. Radcliffe meets with her syllable and affixes group at the front of the room for a 20-minute 
lesson while the rest of the students find comfortable places to read and discuss in the Book Club format (Raphael, 
Pardo, Highfield & McMahon 2013). The syllables and affixes students are studying the final syllable (ar/er/or) that 
poses a challenge for spellers because it is pronounced the same, /ər/, across the different spellings.
Ms. Radcliffe begins her word study lesson using a directed spelling thinking activity (Zutell, 1996). She asks 
her students to spell three words, dollar, faster and actor, as a way to stimulate discussion and set a purpose for the 
sort. Ms. Radcliffe asks students to tell how they spelled each word, encouraging a variety of answers, which include 
doller, dollor, dollar, faster, acter and actor. Ms. Radcliffe then thinks out loud, “Hmmm . . . This is very interesting. We 
agree on how to spell the first syllable of each word, but we don’t always agree about how to spell the final syllable. 
What makes this part hard?” Jason volunteers that the words sound the same at the end. “Do the rest of you agree?” 
Ms. Radcliffe asks and then adds, “Let’s find out if this is true for other words as well.”
Ms. Radcliffe has made a copy of the weekly word sheet and cut it apart to sort on the document camera. She 
selects several words for discussion whose meaning might not be clear (e.g., blister and mayor) and reviews the 
meanings of lunar and solar from their recent science unit. Next she asks, “How might we sort these words?” She 
takes several suggestions that include sorting by vowel patterns and when Sara suggests that they sort by the last 
two letters she responds, “Let’s try that since we agreed that was the hard part of the word.”
Ms. Radcliffe removes all the words except dollar, faster and actor, which she underlines to use as key words for 
the sort. She then displays each word in turn, calling on a student to read it and tell her where to place it (the final 
sort is shown in Figure 7.1). To check the sort they read down each column to be sure they all have the same sound 
at the end. Ms. Radcliffe then asks the students, “What do you notice about these words now that we have sorted 
them?” Several students offer ideas and together they summarise by saying, “When we hear /ər/, the sound will not 
help us spell it, so we will have to concentrate on remembering whether it is spelled er, or or ar.”
Ms. Radcliffe hands out copies of the word sort and goes over the students’ word study assignments for the 
week. She reminds them, “Cut apart and sort the words and then write the word sort in your word study notebooks.” 

	 266	
CH AP TER 7 
While they work at their seats, Ms. Radcliffe meets with a different, 
developmental group to get their weekly sort started. On other days, 
students work independently by doing a blind sort with a partner, 
sorting at home and hunting for additional words in trade books. On 
Friday, Ms. Radcliffe gives them a spelling test of 10 words, but she also 
calls the group together to compile a list of the words they were able 
to find in their word hunts. This extensive list will be used to introduce 
the following week’s lesson, in which students will discover that er is 
the most common way to spell the final sound, that it is always used to 
spell comparative adjectives (faster, smaller, longer), and that er and or 
are often used to spell agents or people who do things (teacher, worker, 
author, sailor).
Ms. Radcliffe’s lesson promotes two key ideas of this stage. First, it 
demonstrates to students how much they already know about spelling a 
particular word—spelling is not an all-or-nothing affair. Usually they will 
get most of the word correct, and teachers need to remind and reassure 
students about this. Second, it demonstrates to students what they need 
to focus on when they look at a word. Because they already know most 
of the word, they need to attend to the part that is still ­challenging. ●

Literacy Development of Students  
in the Syllables and Affixes Stage
Students in the syllables and affixes stage of word knowledge are what Henderson (1990) 
called intermediate readers—students who are not yet mature or advanced readers. Reading skill 
during this stage of development can, on average, span six reading levels, from the third-grade 
level to the eighth-grade level.
Reading in the Syllables and Affixes Stage
The intermediate and middle school years are a time of expanding reading interests and 
fine-tuning of reading strategies. Students will be expected to read textbooks and other infor-
mational texts as classroom instruction shifts to a greater emphasis on content or disciplinary 
studies, a key focus in core standards. In previous developmental stages, the challenges posed 
by reading stem mostly from students’ ability to identify words as they read about familiar top-
ics. At the intermediate level, background knowledge and vocabulary become critical elements 
in comprehension as students explore new genres and topics.
During the syllables and affixes stage, students learn to look at words in a new way, not as 
single-syllable units with CVC, CVVC or other vowel patterns, but as two or more units of 
sound and often of meaning as well. Breaking words into two or more syllabic units is a more 
sophisticated decoding strategy than the phonics instruction typically offered in the primary 
grades using consonants, blends, digraphs and vowel patterns—elements that students master 
in the within word pattern stage. In the syllables and affixes stage, students operate within 
Ehri’s consolidated alphabetic phase (2005, 2014) where they use larger chunks to decode, 
spell and store words in memory. For example, a word like unhappy can be analysed as three 
syllabic chunks (un-hap-py) or two morphemic chunks (un-happy). Word study in the syllables

267
and affixes stage helps students learn where these ­syllable and 
morphemic breaks occur in words so that they can use the 
appropriate chunks to read, spell and determine the meanings 
of polysyllabic words.
Students in the intermediate stage read with greater flu-
ency than at the transitional stage. They have many words 
stored in memory for automatic retrieval and they are learn-
ing how to use syllabic and morphemic chunks to quickly 
and accurately figure out unfamiliar words. This ease of word 
identification and attention to punctuation help them read 
with phrasing and expression. By the end of this stage stu-
dents may read up to 140 words per minute in narrative texts 
(Hasbrouck & Tindal, 2006) and even faster while reading 
silently (Morris, 2013).
Writing in the Syllables and  
Affixes Stage
Intermediate writers become increasingly confident and flu-
ent in their writing and are able to work on longer pieces 
over many days. The ability to automatically spell most of the words they need for writing 
allows them to focus more attention on the meaning they are trying to convey. You are likely 
to hear “voice” in their writing and they are more aware of their audience. Intermediate writ-
ers can be expected to revise their written work and to edit it for spelling and punctuation 
accuracy.
Lexi’s essay on the changes she would make to the Lincoln Middle School cafeteria exudes 
middle school bravado (see Figure 7.2). She touched on all things cool: sound systems, student 
choice, hamburgers and fries and celebrities—all of which were sure to bring her the recogni-
tion she craved as “manager of the year.” At the time, Lexi was a sixth-grader in the later part 
of the syllables and affixes stage. She spelled manager correctly and incorrectly (MANAGAR) 
in the same essay and also confused the unaccented final syllables in other words, such as 
radical (RADACLE) and music (MUSICK). Vowel patterns in accented syllables were still 
not firm (AWSOME for awesome), and she was uncertain about the double consonants within 
base words containing an affix (INSTALATION for installation). Once these syllable and affix 
issues were firmed up, Lexi was poised to study the spelling–meaning connections of the 
next stage of development—derivational relations—and to discover the reason DECESION 
is spelled with an i instead of an e (because it comes from the word decide).
Vocabulary Learning in the Syllables and Affixes Stage
In this stage of literacy development, students’ reading becomes the primary source of new 
vocabulary as they encounter more and more words in text whose meanings they do not know. 
This is especially true in disciplinary studies beyond third grade, such as science and social 
studies as students read information books and textbooks. However, learning words from 
context cannot be left to chance; you need to take an active role in making sure that students’ 
vocabularies are growing steadily. Understanding academic vocabulary is essential to success 
in school (Townsend Filippini, Collins & Biancarosa, 2012) and some ways to teach this are 
presented in this chapter. Vocabulary Their Way (Templeton et al., 2015) provides more detail 
on teaching academic vocabulary, with entire chapters dedicated to content-specific domains 
including English language arts and mathematics.
Students must be taught vocabulary directly at all levels, but particularly general academic 
and domain-specific vocabulary needed in the upper grades (Farstrup & Samuels, 2008; 
Hiebert, 2005; Nagy & Townsend, 2012; Pearson, Hiebert & Kamil, 2007; Zweirs, 2008). Core 
standards often refer to three tiers of vocabulary. After basic tier 1 words, tier 2 corresponds 
FIGURE 7.2   Lexi’s Middle School Essay

	 268	
CH AP TER 7 
roughly to general academic vocabulary and tier 3 is akin to domain-specific academic vocabu-
lary (see Beck, McKeown & Kucan, 2013). These words are often multisyllabic and at first, may 
be a challenge to pronounce, especially for students in the previous stage and in the beginning 
of this intermediate stage of reading. For example, students in this stage may struggle to read 
analysis, analyse or analyst. The change in accent or stress of polysyllabic words is something they 
are learning and which will come later in spelling.
Your own enthusiasm and curiosity about words is likely to enhance students’ word  
consciousness—they develop a favourable attitude toward words and are curious about words 
and word learning (Blachowicz & Fisher, 2009; Lubliner & Scott, 2008; Scott, Skobel  & 
Wells, 2008; Stahl & Nagy, 2006; Templeton et al., 2015). Look for books about language to 
read to your students such as Miss Alaineous: A Vocabulary Disaster by Debra Frasier, The Boy 
Who Loved Words by Roni Schotter, Frindle by Andrew Clements and The Phantom Tollbooth 
by Norton Juster.
Many textbook authors try to provide a rich context to support new vocabulary and often 
highlight important new terms for the reader. Students also need to learn the strategy of breaking 
words into morphemic parts (prefixes, suffixes and base words) so that they can grow confidently 
and competently into independent word learners. Adams (1990) best emphasised this importance:
Learning from context is a very important component of vocabulary acquisition. But this 
means of learning is available only to the extent that children bother to process the spelling—
the orthographic structure—of the unknown words they encounter. Where they skip over an 
unknown word without attending to it, and often readers do, no learning can occur. (p. 150)
Morphemic Analysis.  One of your most important responsibilities for word study 
instruction at this stage is to engage students in examining how important word elements—
prefixes, suffixes and base words—combine. This morphemic analysis is a powerful tool for 
vocabulary development and figuring out unfamiliar words during reading. Students’ knowledge 
of morphology is related to reading comprehension and disciplinary knowledge and achieve-
ment (Carlisle, 2010; Nagy, 2007; Nagy, Berninger & Abbott, 2006; Townsend et al., 2013).
You can show students directly how to apply this knowledge by modelling the following 
strategy for analysing unfamiliar words that they cannot identify in their reading.
1.	 Examine the word for meaningful parts—base word, prefixes or suffixes.
• If there is a prefix or a suffix, take it off so you can find the base.
• Look at the base to see if you know it or if you can think of a related word (a word that 
has the same base).
• Reassemble the word, thinking about the meaning contributed by the base, the suffix 
and then the prefix. This should give you a more specific idea of what the word is.
2.	 Try out the meaning in the sentence; check if it makes sense in the context of the sentence 
and the larger context of the text that you are reading.
3.	 If the word still does not make sense and is critical to the meaning of the overall passage, 
look it up in the dictionary.
4.	 Record the new word on a chart or in a word study notebook to be reviewed over time.
Let’s take a look at how Ms. Radcliffe models this process for students, beginning with a 
familiar word and then extending the lesson to an unfamiliar word.
for Words Their Way®
Vocabulary Study of 
Prefixes and Suffixes
Ms. Bruskotter works with 
her fifth graders in these two 
videos.
“I’ve underlined one of the words in this sentence: They had to redo the programs after they were printed with a spell-
ing error. What does redo mean? Yes, Chloe?”
“When you have to do something over again?”
“Okay! So you already had done something once, right?”
“Now, let’s cover up this first part that we call a prefix [covers re]. What we have left is the base word do. Now, 
let’s look at some other words.”

	
Word Study for Intermediate Readers and Writers	
269
It is critical to model and reinforce this strategic approach to analysing unfamiliar words 
in text. Students need plenty of opportunities to try it out under your guidance (Baumann 
et al., 2003). Encourage students to talk about their ideas as they apply the process so that 
you can encourage, facilitate and redirect as necessary. Morphemic analysis will become one 
of the most effective means of developing and extending students’ vocabulary knowledge. It is 
also important to model what to do when the process does not yield an appropriate meaning 
for the unfamiliar word (e.g., analysing repel into re + pel is not much help)—students should 
consult a dictionary.
Dictionaries.  It is important to have unabridged dictionaries and online dictionaries, 
as well as dictionaries that are published specifically for intermediate students, available in 
the classroom. The American Heritage Children’s Dictionary (grades 4 to 6) and the American 
Heritage Student’s Dictionary (grades 5 to 9) are two dictionaries that are helpful at this stage. 
Attractive in format, they present definitions, word histories and usage information in student-
friendly language.
Dictionaries are crucial for distinguishing alternative meaning of words and then deter-
mining the appropriate one. For example, based on Robyn Montana Turner’s biography of 
Faith Ringgold, Ms. Radcliffe focuses on the word enhancing in the sentence “Faith Ringgold 
decided to use cloth frames as a way of enhancing her art.” Pronouncing the word does not 
seem to help because it is not in the students’ speaking/listening vocabularies, and breaking 
Ms. Radcliffe writes the words join, tell and write on the board; then she writes the prefix re- in front of each 
base word as she pronounces the new word. “When we join the prefix re- to each base word, what happens? Can 
you tell me what these words now mean? We are going to be doing these things again—we can rejoin a group,  
retell a story, rewrite a paper.” She then asks the students what they think the prefix re- means. After a brief discus-
sion, she asks a student to look up the prefix in the dictionary to check their definitions.
Ms. Radcliffe’s next step is to model this strategy with a word she is fairly certain the students do not yet know. 
She shows the following sentence on the overhead:
As they got closer to the front of the line, her friends had to reassure Hannah that the Big Thunder roller 
coaster ride was safe.
“Okay”, Ms. Radcliffe proceeds, “I’ve underlined this word [pointing to reassure]. Any ideas what this word is?” 
Most students shake their heads; Kaitlyn frowns as she slowly pronounces “REE–sure.” “Good try, Kaitlyn”, Ms. Radcliffe 
responds. “You’re trying to pronounce it, but it doesn’t sound like a word we’ve heard before. What about the begin-
ning of the word, though? Could that be the prefix we’ve just been thinking about? Now look for the base word.”
This prompt works for the students and they start trying to pronounce the base, assure, without the prefix  
re-. “Right”, Ms. Radcliffe encourages. “You’ve taken off the prefix, re-, and are trying to figure out the base word. Any 
ideas?” Though a couple of students are pronouncing assure correctly, they are uncertain about its meaning.
Ms. Radcliffe continues: “Well, we know that, whatever assure means, the prefix re- means it’s being done 
again! Let’s look back at the sentence. Do you think Hannah can’t wait to go on the roller coaster—or is she getting 
worried?” After some discussion with the students, Ms. Radcliffe talks about the base word, assure, and explains that 
Hannah’s friends had probably already talked with her about how there had never been any accidents, and had 
helped Hannah to feel more confident—assured her—that Big Thunder was safe. (Most students are nodding their 
heads now, saying things such as “Oh, yeah, I’ve heard that word before.”) As Hannah and her friends got closer to 
actually going on the roller coaster, however, they had to assure her again—reassure her. Ms. Radcliffe asks students 
to check the dictionary definition to confirm the meaning of the word (to remove doubts or fears).
Ms. Radcliffe summarises: “Many times, by looking carefully at a word you don’t know—looking for any pre-
fixes, suffixes, and thinking about the base—you can get pretty close to the actual meaning of the word. Then ask 
yourself if this meaning makes sense in the sentence and text that you’re reading.” ●

the word into parts does not help. Ms. Radcliffe talks about the context in which the word 
occurs; it may narrow the possibilities somewhat, but possible meanings suggested by the con-
text include “protecting” or “showing.” This is definitely a situation in which the dictionary is 
useful and you can model strategies for looking up words.
Dictionaries can also provide helpful information about the history of a word and make 
explicit the interrelationships among words in the same meaning “families.” Discussing dic-
tionary entries illustrates how one word’s entry can include information about words related 
in spelling and meaning; for example, the entry for enhance includes enhancement. Sections 
labelled “Usage Notes”, “Synonyms” and “Word History” provide important information 
about the appropriateness of particular words and subtle but important differences among 
their meanings. Some entries contain stories that explain spellings and deepen understanding 
of important terms. See Activity 7.5 for ideas about teaching students how to use the dictionary.
Word Sorts and Vocabulary.  The word sorts you use to teach spelling gen-
eralisations likely contain words whose meanings should also be explored, perhaps briefly, as 
Ms. Radcliffe did with blister and mayor. As part of your introductory routine, ask a student to 
look up a word and be ready to report to the group its meaning or multiple meanings. This 
is a good way to encourage regular dictionary use for an authentic reason. Avoid assigning 
students to look up long lists of words; instead, have students select several words each week 
to look up in the dictionary and then record definitions or other information (parts of speech, 
origins, etc.). Word study notebook routines can include illustrating five or more words or 
using them in sentences to demonstrate their meanings. You can assign words to students and 
then teach them how to share what they learned in either small groups or as a class activity.
Domain-Specific Vocabulary Instruction.  Domain-specific academic 
vocabulary is used in disciplinary studies and includes specialised vocabulary that has a 
specific meaning, like the term square root in mathematics, perpendicular in geometry and 
democratic process in social studies. Words from specific domains or content areas become 
increasingly important as students move through the grades. You will find these words in 
your district and state standards, and the curricula for the different subject areas. If there is a 
required textbook for a particular content area, it will usually reflect the important concepts 
and the domain-specific vocabulary that represent those concepts (usually bolded in text). In 
the next section we discuss criteria that you will want to apply when selecting vocabulary. Once 
you select words, use the following steps with engaging activities.
1.	 Activate background knowledge. Find out what students already know about the word, and 
remind them of related terms they may already know. For example, if you chose solar, you 
can explore their understanding of the terms solar heat, solar system, solar eclipse and so on.
2.	 Explain the meaning of the word, how it is used, and its relationship to other words that 
share similar meanings: solarium, solar energy and so on.
Ms. Radcliffe underlines the word enhancing and explains that, to check the meaning of this word in the dictionary, 
they need to look up the base word, enhance. Reminding the students that they may need to watch out for changes 
in spelling when they are trying to figure out the base word for an unfamiliar word, she notes that the e is dropped 
when the -ing is added. Looking up a base word also helps to highlight the spelling of other forms of the word.
The students find that the dictionary definition for enhance is “to make greater, as in value, beauty or reputa-
tion.” Ms. Radcliffe has the students return to the sentence in the text and discuss which of these features they 
believe Faith Ringgold had in mind when she decided to use cloth frames. The students agree that, in the context of 
the sentence and the overall text, Faith Ringgold probably wanted to make her quilts more “beautiful.” ●

3.	 Use graphic organisers, charts or diagrams as needed to portray relationships among the 
words.
4.	 Discuss examples and non-examples. In the case of solar, important non-examples would 
relate to other words that share a similar spelling but have a different meaning: sole, soli-
tude, solitary, solidify and so on.
A number of graphic organiser formats developed over the years have proven effective 
in helping engage students with new and/or difficult concepts that lead to understanding 
and deeper knowledge (Blachowicz & Fisher, 2009; Diamond & Gutlohn, 2006; Robb, 1999; 
Stahl & Nagy, 2006; Templeton et al., 2015). One key to the effectiveness of graphic organisers 
is their visual presentation of the relationships among target vocabulary and related concepts. 
Two examples provided in the activity section of this chapter are semantic maps and concept (or 
word) maps. Discussion is critical when using graphic organisers in the classroom. As Stahl and 
Nagy (2006) observe, “The graphs and procedures are no more than structures to explain to 
students what particular words mean. It is the explanation, the talk, that is important” (p. 96).
It is important to remember that most reading vocabulary encountered in content areas is 
developmentally ahead of spelling vocabulary. You can add two-syllable words from a science 
unit on volcanoes (e.g., mantle, pressure, pumice and lava) to sorts featuring syllable patterns 
and accent, but other words (e.g., teutonic) are not appropriate spelling words for students in 
the syllables and affixes stage. Words with complex Greek and Latin word parts are studied in 
the next stage, derivational relations.
General Academic Vocabulary Instruction.  General academic 
vocabulary is ubiquitous in the language used across all disciplines (Coxhead, 2000; Gard-
ner & Davies, 2013), and students’ knowledge of general academic vocabulary is related to 
school success (Townsend et al., 2012). Can you imagine any textbook without these general 
academic words: however, analysis, comparison, establish, major, response or structure? General 
academic vocabulary is often the mortar that holds domain-specific vocabulary and concepts 
together, but the words are often difficult to define in isolation. Instead of trying to define 
words like nevertheless, however, similar or likewise, use such terms repeatedly in meaningful 
contexts (“Let’s look at how these ideas are similar, or alike”). Help students understand what 
functions the words serve—what the words ask readers to do (Flanigan, Templeton & Hayes, 
2012). For example, students may know that establish is a synonym for set up or show, but pre-
senting this word in phrases helps students understand the nuances of meaning: to establish an 
argument is a more formal presentation of ideas than to set up or show an argument. There are 
other phrases that add depth to students’ understanding of establish; for example, establish the 
truth, establishment of the state of Israel and established custom.
Text structures that compare and contrast, sequence, examine cause and effect, pose a 
problem and/or present a resolution have their own general academic vocabulary associated 
with them. Take an excerpt from a text and model for students how to locate general academic 
vocabulary. You may want to begin with the lists prepared by Coxhead (2000; available online 
at www.victoria.ac.nz/lals/resources/academicwordlist/), or Gardner & Davies (2013), to show 
them general academic vocabulary and how these words and phrases function to hold text 
together. After this modelling, ask students to work with partners to locate general academic 
vocabulary, create class charts of these words and phrases and record these collections in their 
vocabulary notebooks. They can share their lists with the class and discuss how the general 
academic vocabulary indicates a particular text structure; for example, phrases like in contrast, 
on the other hand, likewise and along the same lines indicate a compare and contrast–type text 
structure.
Another way to familiarise students with the meaning of general academic vocabulary is 
to increase their exposure to related words or words that come from the same word family. 
By using dictionaries and other resources, students can find numerous related words that will 
clarify meanings. For example, when you look up analyse in a dictionary or an online source 
(e.g., OneLook), you find many members of the analysis word family including analysed, ana-
lysing, analysis, analyst, analytic, analytical, analytically, analyses, psychoanalyst, microanalysis and 

	 272

self-analysis. Students can work in pairs to discuss 
the meaning of a few of these words and develop 
sentences to share with their classmates. In the next 
stage of development, students examine the Greek 
origin of words that begin with ana- to find that it 
is derived from “a loosening”, or “breaking up” and 
possibly find other words. For now, learning this word 
family in its various contexts, and being comfortable 
with reading, writing and talking about what the 
word analyse means is ideal. Furthermore, during this 
syllables and affixes stage, students may examine this 
word family for the meaning of different suffixes; 
for example, -ed, -ly, -ic, -al. These exercises increase 
students’ exposure to general academic vocabulary in 
different contexts.
Concept Sorts and Disciplinary 
Learning.  The growing focus on disciplinary 
area instruction in the intermediate grades (CCSS, 
2010) provides opportunities to use the concept sorts 
described in earlier chapters. In order for new vocab-
ulary to “stick”, students need multiple exposures to 
those words in multiple contexts (Beck, McKeown &  
Kucan, 2002). Concept sorts provide that exposure 
and help students form relationships between words 
and their ideas.
Figure 7.3 presents a concept sort developed 
by a fourth-grade math teacher to introduce the 
exploration of planes and solids. The teacher gave 
students a collection of word cards and asked them 
to work with a partner to discuss what they understood about the terms and to sort them 
into one of the two categories: planes and solids. Then the students came together as a 
whole class to share. In this fashion, understandings and misunderstandings were brought 
to the fore and the teacher got a good sense of the level and depth of students’ background 
knowledge of these terms. You can also ask students to match words to pictures or objects. 
At the end of a unit, use concept sorts to review or assess the vocabulary.
Some students may argue that some of the solids could go in both categories; for example, 
a cone and a cylinder both have a flat surface as well as a curved surface. They may wish to 
create a separate category for them. Later in the unit, the math teacher introduced a second 
sort of solid figures to fine-tune students’ understanding.
Which Words to Teach?.  A common lament is that there are “so many words, so 
little time.” Although most of your students’ vocabularies grow through wide reading and dis-
cussion about that reading, you are still responsible for selecting words for students to tackle. 
Publishers of the textbooks, eBooks and other curricular resources that you may be required 
to use have already selected and highlighted vocabulary and, while that is helpful, you still have 
a bit of work to do. The following questions will guide your decisions about which “target” 
or “key” vocabulary words to select, and how to will address them (Templeton et al., 2015).
• Which words are critical to address in depth before moving into the unit/selection? What are 
the words that represent major concepts and for which students need to develop a deep 
understanding? Introduce and develop these at the beginning of the unit and before the 
reading, as well as during and after.

• Which words are critical to address only briefly before moving into the unit/selection? Students 
must know these words for the specific reading assignment, but do not require a deep 
understanding. Mention these words and provide brief definitions.
• Which words are critical but might lend themselves to students’ problem solving during their read-
ing? These words are important but students may figure them out through morphemic 
analysis and/or help from the context. Follow up on these words after the reading.
Orthographic Development in  
the Syllables and Affixes Stage
In previous chapters, systematic word study was limited to vowel and consonant patterns 
within single-syllable words to build a foundation for the polysyllabic words of intermediate 
word study, in much the same way that basic math facts build a foundation for long division. 
Once students have this foundation, they are ready to begin studying polysyllabic words. Lexi’s 
writing sample (Figure 7.2) shows that students in this stage spell most words correctly, mak-
ing their writing quite readable, but they continue to make more advanced spelling errors.
Table 7.1 provides a summary of what students know, what they use but confuse, and 
what is still missing in the early, middle and late syllables and affixes stage. In the early part 
of this stage, students may still be confused with less common or ambiguous vowel patterns, 
as in the spelling of CRALL for crawl. However, for the most part students know how to spell 
single-syllable words correctly and are ready to study the conventions involved in adding end-
ings such as -ing. Spellings such as SHOPING and AMAZZING show us that students know 
how to spell the -ing suffix but lack knowledge about the doubling rule where syllables join. 
Examining inflected words with -ing endings is a good introduction to studying two-syllable 
words and the conventions that govern spelling where syllables meet—the syllable juncture.

Syllable juncture problems can also be seen in the “used but confused” doubled letters in 
KEPPER for keeper and the lack thereof in BOTEL for bottle.
The syllables and affixes stage represents a new point in word analysis because there is 
more than one syllable to consider and each syllable may present a spelling problem. For 
example, students might spell the long vowel in the accented second syllable of parading with 
the ai pattern, as in PARAIDING. More likely, however, they will have problems with unac-
cented final syllables, such as BOTTEL for bottle and DAMIGE for damage. As the name 
of the stage suggests, in addition to syllables, students grapple with meaning units such as 
­prefixes and suffixes (known collectively as affixes) and begin to study base words as mor-
phemes or meaning units that must retain their spellings when affixes are added. In KEPER 
for keeper, the student may be relying on sound rather than knowledge of the word keep. In 
the sections that follow we describe the major features for instruction in the syllables and 
affixes stage.
Base Words and Inflectional Endings/Suffixes
One category of suffixes is inflectional endings, such as -s, -ed and -ing, that change the 
­number and tense of the base word but do not change its meaning or part of speech. These 
endings also include the comparative forms -er and -est. Although inflectional endings have 
been examined in oral language since the preschool years, studying them in spelling intro-
duces students to base words and suffixes as well as the rules that govern spelling changes. 
Probably the most common suffix students learned earlier is the plural, adding -s even when 
the sound it represents varies, as in cats (/s/) and dogs (/z/). However, plurals deserve to be 
addressed systematically in this stage to cover additional issues.
• Add -es when words end in ch, sh, ss, s and x. When -es is added to a word, students can 
usually “hear” the difference because it adds another syllable to the word (dish becomes 
dish-es, unlike spoons).
• Change the y at the end of a word to i before adding -es when the word ends in a conso-
nant + y (baby to babies) but not when it ends in a vowel + y (monkeys).
• Words may change spelling and pronunciation in the plural form. Some words with 
final f or fe change the f to v and add es (wife to wives, wolf to wolves). Other words take 
a new form (goose to geese and mouse to mice). And some words remain the same (fish, 
sheep, deer).
One of the major challenges students 
face when adding -ed or -ing is whether to 
double the final letter of the base word. 
The basic doubling rule is that when a suffix 
beginning with a vowel is added to a base 
word containing a single vowel followed by a 
single consonant (e.g., shop), double the final 
consonant (e.g., shopping, shopped). This can 
be simplified as the one-one-one rule: one 
syllable, one vowel, one consonant—double. 
There are some exceptions such as words 
that end with x and w, which never double 
(taxing, showed), but the doubling rule is 
worth learning and has implications for syl-
lable junctures, as described shortly. It takes 
time, however, for students to develop a firm 
understanding of it.
Rather than teaching rules, we suggest a 
series of word sorts that will allow students 
to discover the many principles at work.

FIGURE 7.4   Adding Inflectional Endings to Base Words

	
Word Study for Intermediate Readers and Writers	
275
In Sort 1 of Figure 7.4, the ­students first sorted by words that double and those that do not, 
and then were asked to underline the base word. In Sort 2, sorting by the vowel pattern in the 
base word helped students discover that there are two conditions when the ending is simply 
added (CVVC words like read and CVCC words like rest) whereas only CVC words need to 
double. This will help clear up the confusion of smelling and dressing, words that students may 
initially place in the doubled column.
Table 7.2 summarises the conditions that govern adding inflectional endings. The rules 
can get quite complicated, but when planning instruction, begin with the most common in 
the early syllables and affixes stage (numbers 1–5) and expect to reinforce these throughout 
the intermediate grades and even beyond in the case of two- and three-syllable words (where 
rules apply only if the final syllable is accented). Remember that it will take time for students 
to master these generalisations, and they should know the spellings of the base words before 
you ask them to think about how to add suffixes that require changing the base word.
Compound Words
When students explore compound words, they learn different things. First, they learn how 
a word like sun can combine in different ways to form new words, as shown in the concept 
map in Figure 7.5. This is an introduction to the combinatorial features of English words in 
building vocabulary. Second, studying compound words lays the foundation for explicit atten-
tion to syllables: compound words often comprise two smaller words, each of which is a single 
syllable. Third, students reinforce their knowledge of the spellings of many high-frequency,

high-utility words in English that are compound words (someone, anything). Look at Activity 
7.4 on page 280 for specific ideas, such as illustrating words and brainstorming words that 
share the same base.
Open and Closed Syllables and Syllable Patterns
Why is Tigger, the name of the tiger from Winnie the Pooh, spelled with two gs? How do you 
pronounce Caddie Woodlawn? Answering these questions depends on whether the first syllable 
in the word is open or a closed. Open syllables (CV) end with a long vowel sound: tiger, Katy, 
reason. Closed syllables (CVC) contain a short vowel sound that is usually “closed” by two 
consonants: Tigger, Caddie, racket.
Students are first introduced to the basics of open and closed syllables when they exam-
ine what happens when -ed and -ing are added to short and long vowel pattern words. If they 
write about how a rabbit moves along the ground (hopping) and do not double the p, they 
wind up with an entirely different meaning (hoping). The same confusion occurs in words like 
riding and ridding or griped and gripped. As Henderson (1985) explained, “The core principle 
of syllable juncture is that of doubling consonants to mark the short English vowel” (p. 65). 
Students learn that when they do not know whether to double the consonants at the juncture 
of syllables, they should listen to the vowel sound in the first syllable. If they hear a long vowel 
sound, the syllable is open and will not end with a consonant (hu-man). If they hear a short 
vowel sound, the odds are likely that the syllable is closed with an extra consonant (mam-mal). 
Knowing whether to double develops first through examining base words plus inflectional 
suffixes, and is later applied within base words. Because the vowel in the first syllable of Tigger 
is short, the g is doubled; because the vowel in the first syllable of tiger is long, the g is not 
doubled.
Another way of describing what happens where syllables meet is through syllable juncture 
patterns, as shown in Table 7.3. For example, hopping, Tigger and stripping illustrate the 
VCCV syllable juncture pattern for closed syllables; hoping, tiger and striping illustrate the 
V/CV syllable juncture pattern for open syllables. These patterns are the most frequent. The 
third pattern, the closed VC/V pattern, with only a single consonant at the juncture after a 
short vowel (nev-er, pan-ic) occurs less frequently. The fourth pattern, the closed VCCCV 
pattern, includes words that have a consonant digraph or blend at the syllable juncture 
that cannot be separated (ath-lete, hun-dred). In the VV pattern, each vowel contributes a

sound—the word is usually divided after the first long 
vowel sound (cre-ate, li-on) so it is another example of 
an open syllable.
Figure 7.6 shows a two-step sort that you can use 
to introduce syllable juncture patterns. Begin by sort-
ing three to four words into each column in a Guess 
My ­Category activity (see page 82 in Chapter 3). Ask 
students to help you sort the rest of the words as shown 
in Sort 1. After sorting, ask students how the words in 
each column are alike. Explore further by asking if any-
one noticed the vowel sounds and where the words were 
“divided” when you pronounced them. After completing 
this first sort, the words in the second column can be 
sorted further by those that have different consonants 
at the juncture and those that have the same, as shown 
in Sort 2.
Review Vowel Patterns in  
Two-Syllable Words
You can reexamine vowel sounds in two-syllable words as a way to review 
those patterns and extend students’ understanding of how those patterns 
work in polysyllabic words. For example, look at the familiar long-a patterns 
in the sort in Figure 7.7. Students in the syllables and affixes stage learn to 
listen for the accented syllable and see the familiar vowel patterns (ai, ay and 
a-e) they learned in the within word pattern stage.
Students fully master a number of vowel patterns within single-syllable 
and polysyllabic words during the within word pattern stage. These are often 
called ambiguous vowels because they represent a range of sounds and 
spellings. For example, the vowel sound is the same in cause, lawn and false, 
but is spelled three different ways (au, aw, al). The ou spelling pattern has 
four different sounds in shout, touch, through and thought. These variations are 
often cited as examples of the irregularity of English spelling, but word sort-
ing allows students to see that they form consistent categories just like other 
vowel patterns (Johnston, 2001).
By paying attention to the position of ambiguous vowels, students can often determine 
which spelling pattern occurs most often. For example, aw and oy usually occur at the ends of 
words or syllables (straw, boycott), whereas au and oi are found within syllables (fault, voice). If

these patterns persist as problems into the syllables and affixes stage, then it is appropriate to 
take a step back and spend a little more time with these vowels in one-syllable words. You can 
also examine them, with other vowel patterns, in two-syllable words like mouthful, counter and 
lousy versus coward, chowder and brownie.
Accent or Stress
In most words of two or more syllables, one syllable is emphasised—stressed or accented—
more than the others. Why do we teach accent? First, it helps students learn how to pro-
nounce new words when they check in the dictionary. Some dictionaries use apostrophes to 
show which syllables are accented, while others boldface the accented syllable; teach your 
students both systems. (Digital dictionaries help with pronunciation because students can click 
on the speaker icon to hear the correct pronunciation.) The second, more important, reason 
for teaching accent, or stress, is that it provides the language for us to talk about a number of 
spelling challenges. Different syllables or parts of words are more challenging to spell because 
they are either unaccented or receive less stress in a word. A final reason pertains to word 
meanings, as in the case of homographs or words that are spelled the same but are pronounced 
differently, according to which syllable is accented. We may sign a contract when we buy a 
house, but we might contract a contractor to build it.
Determining the accented syllable may be a challenge, but sorting students’ names is a 
good way to introduce the concept. When we pronounce a familiar name, where do we put 
the most emphasis? Which syllable seems to “sound louder” than the others? We pronounce 
Molly’s name “moll ee”, not “mo lee”. We say “jen ifer”, not “je ni fer” or “jenni fer”. One way 
to test for accent is to hold the back of your hand lightly under your chin as you say a two-
syllable word such as a-round. Your jaw probably drops more for the accented syllable. Now 
try this with certain homographs, words that are spelled alike but whose meanings and parts 
of speech change with a shift in accent:
Would you present the present to the guest of honour?
It is a good idea to record your expenses so you have a record of them.
The landfill might refuse the refuse.
When examining multisyllable words, knowing about accent helps students identify what 
they need to pay particular attention to. For example, when students pronounce the word mar-
ket, they realise they know the spelling of the accented syllable (mar), yet may be uncertain about 
the vowel spelling in the final unaccented syllable (ket or kit?). When students grasp the con-
cept of an accented syllable they also learn about the other side of this concept, the unaccented 
syllable. The unaccented syllable is the one in which the spelling of the vowel is not clearly long 
or short, so students need to pay close attention to it. The sound in this syllable is often repre-
sented by the schwa sound—the upside down e in a dictionary pronunciation key (ɘ). By the 
middle of the syllables and affixes stage, word study can focus on these unaccented final syllables.
/ɘr/ as in super, actor and sugar
/ɘl/ as in angle, angel, metal, civil and fertile
/ɘn/ as in sudden, human, basin, apron and captain
/chɘr/, /yɘr/ and /zhɘr/ as in lecture, figure and treasure
/ĭj/ as in village and damage
/ē/ as in money, cookie and story
When sorting words with unaccented final syllables, you will find there is often no tidy 
generalisation that governs the spelling and students may have to simply commit many of 
these words to memory. However, sometimes a part is related to the ending. For example, 
verbs and adjectives tend to end in -en (waken, golden), whereas nouns end in -on (prison, dragon). 
Comparative adjectives are always spelled with -er, as in smarter, faster and taller. (Sorting 
words by parts of speech as well as by spelling patterns is an important extension when study-
ing words like these.) What is most useful for students to discover is that some spellings are 
simply more common than others. For example, there are over 1,000 words that end in -le 

	
Word Study for Intermediate Readers and Writers	
279
but only about 200 that end in -el. The ending -er is much more common than -ar or -or. An 
excellent follow-up to sorting these words is creating class lists that give students insight into 
the frequencies. Then they might use a “best guess” strategy when spelling an unfamiliar word.
Identifying the vowel in unaccented syllables is one of the biggest challenges we all face as 
spellers. As our colleague Tom Gill explains to students, “You can’t trust sound when your voice 
goes down.” However, as we have discussed briefly and shall see further in the next chapter, the 
spelling of the schwa in the unaccented syllable can sometimes be explained in terms of meaning 
or parts of speech. At this stage, introduce and begin discussing how the “spelling–meaning con-
nection” may explain some of these spellings. The -el ending in angel, for example, also occurs in 
the related adjective angelic; the -al in metal occurs in the adjective metallic; and the -an in human 
occurs in the adjective humane. The accented syllables in these related words often provide a 
clue to the spellings of unaccented syllables, as well as expanding students’ vocabularies.
Further Exploration of Consonants
Consonants continue to be revisited in more difficult words during this stage. Consider words 
like circus or garbage, in which c and g represent two different sounds. (They might be spelled 
phonetically as /sɘr-kɘs/ and /gär-bĭj/.) Generalisations about the spelling of hard and soft g 
and c reveal an underlying logic. As in one-syllable words, the sounds of g and c depend on the 
vowel that follows (a, o and u follow the hard sound, whereas e, i and y follow the soft sound), 
which results in some interesting spellings. Why is there a silent u in tongue? Without it, the 
g would become soft (/tɘnj/). The sound of /k/ can be spelled with ck (shamrock), c (magic), x 
(index) and qu (antique), and many words contain silent consonants such as t (moisten), h (hon-
est), k (knuckle), gh (daughter) and h again (rhythm). Studying silent consonants foreshadows 
the in-depth study of spelling–meaning connections explored in the next stage, derivational 
relations, in which silent letters like the t in moisten can be explained by its connection to moist.
Base Words and Simple Derivational Affixes
While students spend time examining and consolidating their word knowledge at the syllable 
level, they should also focus on base words and simple derivational affixes (both prefixes and 
suffixes). Inflectional suffixes such as –s, -ed and –ing do not significantly affect the meaning 
or part of speech of the base word to which they are attached; helps, helped and helping are still 
verbs. However, derivational affixes often do affect the meanings and grammatical functions of 
the bases to which they are attached. For example, adding derivational affixes such as -ful, -ly 
or -ness to the base word help changes it from a verb to an adjective, adverb or noun, as in help-
ful, helpfully or helpfulness. Students benefit from learning about the meanings of derivational 
affixes as well as their role in changing the meaning and grammatical function of the base word.
The terms base word and root word are often used interchangeably. We prefer using base 
word when referring to words that stand on their own after all prefixes and suffixes have been 
removed (govern in government; agree in disagreement). Base words such as 
these are also known as free morphemes. We use the term root to refer to 
a word part that remains after all prefixes and suffixes have been removed 
but usually is not itself a word that can stand alone (vis in visible and spec in 
spectator). These roots, also known as bound morphemes, usually come from 
Greek or Latin.
Lay the groundwork for this study during the within word pattern stage 
when you talk about simple prefixes and suffixes in reading vocabulary. At the 
syllables and affixes stage, students explore in depth how prefixes and suffixes 
combine with base words and word roots to create new words, and how to 
spell many of those words. This helps students analyse unknown words they 
encounter in their reading, leading to expansive and elaborate vocabularies.
The sort in Figure 7.8 shows one way to introduce prefixes and base 
words in a systematic way. Unlike most sorts, we do not recommend talking 
about the meaning of words until after the sort. Instead, encourage students to

develop their own hypotheses about the prefix meanings as they consider the word list. Using 
the words in sentences, such as “I must obey my parents because if I disobey them I get in trouble”, 
helps to focus on the shifts in meaning. Explore the generative aspect of combining prefixes 
and bases by constructing different words through combining and recombining prefix and base 
word cards or tiles in various ways: combine dis-, re-, un- with able and order to produce disable, 
disorder, reorder and unable.
Introduce suffixes through sorts in which students discover how the derivational suffixes 
affect the meanings of known words as well as parts of speech. For example, add -y to the noun 
guilt to produce the adjective guilty; adding -ly produces the adverb guiltily. Some derivational 
suffixes to study in this stage for both vocabulary and spelling include:
-er as in farmer and -or as in professor (both denote “agents or someone or something who 
does something”; words of Latin origin use the -or spelling)
-y, -ly, -ful, -less and -ness (these suffixes generally change the meaning and part of speech, 
creating adjectives, adverbs and nouns)
Students should revisit the rules that govern e-drop and doubling as they add suffixes to base 
words. Brave becomes bravely with no change (the prefix -ly begins with a consonant), but 
when adding -er or -est (which begin with a vowel), the doubling rule applies, as in flatter 
and flattest. In addition, y must be changed to i before adding suffixes (silly to sillier, silliest, 
silliness).
Spelling Strategies
By the syllables and affixes stage, expectations for correct spelling include a large percentage 
of the words students use when writing. A good activity to do with students is to brainstorm a 
list of the many things they can do when they do not know how to spell a word they need for 
writing. A list can include the following: listen for the sounds and spell as best you can; ask a 
friend; ask the teacher; look around the room; try it and see if it looks right; think of a word 
that sounds like it (spell by analogy); and look it up in a dictionary. Help students to prioritise 
these options, and throughout this stage show them how to think of related words and see if 
there is a spelling–meaning connection they can make.
Help Children Develop a Spelling Conscience.  We want to create a 
desire in students to improve their spelling and have pride in what they can do correctly. 
There are several ways to do this, keeping in mind there needs to be a balance between expec-
tations for correct spelling and encouraging students to spell as best they can in order to write 
with real purpose.
1.	 Talk with students about why good spelling matters (to be sure readers can understand 
what we write; to give a good impression) and when it matters. Brainstorm with them a 
list of the kinds of writing that need to be correctly spelled.
2.	 Meet with students during and after their independent writing time and talk about their 
spelling. Compliment them on the words they got right (or almost right) and ask them 
what they did. You may be surprised at the wide range of strategies they already use 
(Chandler, 1999). Talk about a few words that you think they might be able to add to their 
personal lists or dictionaries, or spell correctly with a bit more attention. For example, 
Ruth wrote, “The wind blue all through the night.” The teacher began by saying, “You 
got that tough word through. How did you know that?” Ruth replied that when she spelled 
it as THRU that it did not look right so she found it in her spelling dictionary. Then the 
teacher pointed to the word blue. “That names the colour but there is a homophone for 
the word you need. Let’s check our homophone collection.”
3.	 Expect students at this stage to edit their written work for spelling errors but only when 
you take the time to teach spelling and editing strategies. Simply saying, “Read your 
paper and find your spelling mistakes”, is not particularly helpful. Modelling is important: 
when you write for students, think aloud about spelling, and model spelling strategies as 

	
Word Study for Intermediate Readers and Writers	
281
well as proofreading techniques such as rereading to check spelling. Occasionally, project 
a student’s writing sample (with permission) and model with the class how you go about 
proofreading it using the tips in Figure 3.25, on page 107 in Chapter 3.
Does It Look Right?  Intermediate readers have seen many words and can use the strategy 
of writing a word and then considering whether it looks right. Introduce this using the “Have-a- 
Go” sheet (see Figure 6.10, on page 234 in Chapter 6), but as students progress, they can use 
the strategy less formally. They need only to write one or two attempts anywhere that is handy.
Look it up in the dictionary.  Let’s be honest: few of us turn to a thick heavy dictionary to look 
up the spelling of a word if other resources are more easily available, like spell check or asking 
the person beside you. Still, we want students to practice this skill so that it is available to them. 
Spelling dictionaries contain lists of commonly used words without definitions so they are much 
easier to use. (See page 234 in Chapter 6 for a list of spelling dictionaries). If you have students 
who are literate in a language other than English they may find a bilingual dictionary handy. 
They can look up a word they know in their own language to find the English spelling (2008).
Spell check using software.  Some educators and parents worry that using spell check dis-
courages students from learning to spell. There is no evidence that this is true and besides, if 
word study is an ongoing part of your curriculum, then your students are getting the spelling 
instruction they need. Once students reach the syllable and affixes stage, they should be spell-
ing most words correctly. While they continue to invent spellings for words they don’t know, 
the process is less valuable.
If students are using word processing software, teach them how to use spell check but also 
to be aware of its shortcomings. Point out that homophone errors are not likely to be caught 
(hear/here), similarly spelled words are often skipped (fat/fate, cut/cute) and that unusual proper 
names may be incorrectly identified as misspellings (Leesa, Garrie). (Rare technical terms 
might also be identified but this is probably not an issue for your students). For most compe-
tent spellers, errors are often due to poor typing skills, but it is also the case that students may 
not know how to spell a word. Spell check may help in both cases. Explain that students can 
correct underlined errors right away or ignore them until the editing stage.
Regardless of which digital devices your students use, you need to teach them how to use 
them. Introduce spell check using an interactive white board or LCD projector to walk through 
the steps. Provide students with a sample document that has multiple spelling errors and assign 
them the task of correcting the errors using spell check. Be explicit about the following:
• Encourage students to make an effort to spell a word using what they already know—
something they should have been doing for a long time. Spell check will not work unless 
there is a good approximation of the word.
• Encourage students to carefully study the suggestion(s) to not only select the correct 
word but to note the mistake they made so that the next time they will be more likely 
to spell the word correctly. As handy as spell check may be, it is still much faster to spell 
words correctly the first time.
• Clarify the limitations of spell check.
• Remind students that spell check is a useful tool but it will not replace the careful reread-
ing needed for a polished paper.
Word Study Instruction for the 
Syllables and Affixes Stage
Too often, spelling instruction at the intermediate level and above lacks systematic attention 
to generalisations. Without a good understanding of the features that require instruction 
at this level, teachers in the upper grades often give students lists of spelling words from 
for English Learners

	 282	
CH AP TER 7 
content areas that are really vocabulary words (amphibian, vertebrates, metamorphosis, carni-
vore). While such words are important for understanding content and concepts, they lack 
any common spelling features and may not be appropriate for students who are in different 
spelling stages.
We hope you have come to understand from this chapter that systematic word study tar-
geted to meet student needs can advance students’ spelling knowledge, their vocabularies and 
their strategies for figuring out unknown words in reading. At the intermediate and middle 
grades, the following principles should guide instruction:
• Actively involve students in the exploration of words. They are more likely to develop a 
positive attitude toward learning words, and a curiosity about words—what is known as 
word consciousness.
• Engage students’ prior knowledge. This is especially important if they are learning spe-
cialised vocabulary in different disciplines or content areas.
• Ensure students have many exposures to words in meaningful contexts, both in and out 
of connected text.
• Provide students with systematic instruction of structural elements and how these ele-
ments combine; elements include syllables, affixes and the effects of affixes on the base 
words to which they are attached.
Guidelines for Creating Sorts in the Syllables and Affixes Stage
Throughout this chapter, we discuss directions for word sorting, particularly in the Routines 
and Management section that follows. There are a few cautions for you to consider during this 
upper-level word study.
There is a visual simplicity to the sorts in this stage. The sorts are a starting point, with 
the ultimate goal of students understanding the meaning and function of spelling patterns, 
like the meaning of prefixes and suffixes. Some students think that once they sort and record 
words in their word study vocabulary notebooks, their work is done; in fact, the study has just 
begun. For example, think of how easy it is for students to sort words that begin with particu-
lar prefixes or suffixes, like dis-, ex- or mis-, and how much more goes into adding examples 
and making meaning connections for these prefixes. Many sorts during this stage hinge on 
­making spelling–meaning connections. Once the spelling aspect becomes apparent, have 
students try to figure out the meaning connection to the spelling. For this reason, we discuss 
ways for you to increase students’ exposure to words that share a specific spelling–meaning 
connection.
Consider the difficulty of the vocabulary in word sorts during this stage. It is likely that 
intermediate-grade students in the syllables and affixes stage can read many words whose 
meanings elude them so it is important to consider the semantic difficulty of the words as 
much as the spelling challenge when selecting words and features to study at this stage. For 
example, the old saying “i before e except after c or when sounded like a as in neighbour and 
weigh” may be worthwhile to teach, but many of the examples of words that follow the rule 
may not be in the speaking vocabulary of elementary students (conceive, perceive, conceited, 
receipt). It is fine to select a few words whose meanings students might not know, or words that 
they only know tenuously, but do not overburden sorts with these words.
Sequence and Pacing of Word Study in 
the Syllables and Affixes Stage
For students in the elementary grades who have reached the syllables and affixes stage, there 
is less urgency than in earlier stages because they have mastered much of what is typically 
considered “phonics” (consonants, blends, digraphs and vowels) and they can spell most 
single-syllable and high-frequency words. However, students still have much to master in 
spelling, and knowing how to tackle unfamiliar multisyllabic words they encounter in ­reading.

A word study sequence for this stage is presented in Table 7.4. The sequence touches on the 
important spelling patterns and features to consider, and is based on what students do devel-
opmentally. Normally, achieving students in the intermediate grades will take at least two 
years and more to progress through this stage. In addition, studying generative morphology 
using base words, roots, and affixes is explored through vocabulary study: the powerful role 
that knowledge of processes of word combination plays in vocabulary development as well 
as spelling.
The Elementary Spelling Inventory (ESI) described in Chapter 2 helps identify students 
in the syllables and affixes stage. Some teachers find that the Upper-Level Spelling Inventory 
(USI) provides better information about students in the later part of the stage. If students 
appear to be in the late syllables and affixes or derivational relations stage on the ESI, be 
sure to move on to the USI. Use the spell checks on the PDToolkit and in the Words Their 
Way supplements to more accurately identify what features students are ready to study. Use 
Table  7.1 (see page 273) to determine what features they are using but confusing to plan 
instruction. If in doubt about where to place students, remember it is best to take a step back 
and study earlier features that students may not fully understand even if they are spelling many 
words with those features correctly.
At advanced spelling stages (both syllable and affixes and derivational relations) you may 
find students “levelling out” on their spelling inventory results; that is, they are instructional 
on a range of spelling features at the same time and a few features are missing completely. 
This means that a strict sequence of instruction is not as important as in previous stages, 
and you can form larger groups for instructing certain features. For example, you can teach 
prefixes any time in the recommended sequence as well as to students in early derivational 
relations. However, do not rush students in the elementary grades through the syllables and 
affixes stage, into the derivational relations stage, because they may not be ready for the more 
advanced vocabulary used in the word sorts. At the same time, students in the middle grades 
who are still in the syllables and affixes stage should be moved along at a steady pace and 
might skip the late features, because they are covered again in early derivational relations. 
Students in the middle grades and high school who are in this stage may need the extra sup-
port suggested in Words Their Way® with Struggling Readers: Word Study for Reading, Vocabulary 
and Spelling Instruction, Grades 4–12 (Flaniganet al., 2011).
Early, Middle or Late Placement.  Identifying whether students are in the 
early, middle or late part of the stage (see Table 7.4) will help you target where in the sequence 
of features to begin word study instruction.
Early. Students early in this stage know how to spell the vowel patterns in most single-­syllable 
words but make errors when adding inflectional endings, as in SHOPING for shopping and 
CARRYES for carries. They are ready to explore the “double, drop or nothing” principles that 
govern the place where base word and inflection meet.
Middle. Students in the middle of the stage usually add inflectional endings correctly but 
make mistakes with syllable junctures within words and with unaccented final syllables, as 
in RIPPIN for ripen and BOTEL for bottle. They are ready to extend their understanding of 
doubling to syllable junctures within words as they study open and closed syllables. Vowel pat-
terns that students learned in the within word pattern stage are reviewed within the accented 
syllable. After studying accented syllables, students in the middle of the syllables and affixes 
stage look at the final unstressed syllable and two-syllable homophones and homographs. 
They also examine some unusual consonant sounds and spellings.
Late. Students who can spell most words correctly in the syllables and affixes categories 
on the inventory are at the end of the stage. In word study, the focus is on simple prefixes 
and derivational suffixes that affect the meanings of familiar base words in straightforward 
ways (rebuild, dislike) as an introduction to the spelling–meaning connection that is the 
focus in the derivational relations stage. For a faster pace, students in middle grades or

high school might skip this introduction and go to the sorts recommended for early deri-
vational relations in which they review these affixes in more advanced words (reconsider, 
discourage).
Assess and Monitor Progress in 
the Syllables and Affixes Stage
Involve students in the upper elementary grades in their own progress monitoring, which, as 
they track their progress over time, can be very motivating.
Weekly Assessments and Spell Checks
Weekly spelling tests and unit assessments are described in Chapter 6 as a means by which 
you can monitor student progress. Call out 10 sorting words each week, but also include some 
words that assess transfer of a feature (e.g., more words to which students must add -ing or -ed) 
or words from a previous week’s sort to send the message that students are not just responsible 
for the set of words they sorted that week. When students make errors on these assessments, 
you can ask them to go back to their word study notebooks to review the generalisations they 
explored and then to analyse their errors in an attempt to determine why they misspelled. 
Figure 7.9 shows two examples from a lesson on hard and soft g.
Monitoring Progress and Goal Setting
To assess retention over time, prepare an assessment that samples words from previous lessons, 
or use the unit spell checks on the website or in Words Their Way®: Word Sorts for Syllables and 
Affixes Spellers. Review and grade students’ word study notebooks once a week. In addition, the 
student contract and grading form (see Figures 3.17 and 3.20 in Chapter 3) help to monitor 
progress. Use the assessments’ results to determine whether students have met the goals in the 
goal-setting charts available on the website.
Figure 7.10 is an example of the goal-setting chart for early syllables and affixes. We 
recommend that you meet with students individually to go over the spelling inventory you 
used to assess them initially and to identify where to begin the study of features listed on 
the chart. When students score 90 to 100 percent on weekly tests and 80 to 100 percent on 
unit spell checks, that feature can be considered “mastered.” If students do not meet these 
goals you should consider whether they were appropriately placed for instruction or whether 
they got adequate practice each week with the words. It may be necessary to reteach using  
different sets of words or increase the number of times students sort their words during  
the week.

Word Study with English Learners in  
the Syllables and Affixes Stage
English learners in the syllables and affixes stage have mastered many of the basic phonics and 
spelling generalisations of English and are ready to study the more advanced features of this 
stage. However, many of the words used in sorts at this stage may be new vocabulary. For this 
reason, it is especially important to make word study a language-learning event. Words that 
are featured due to spelling issues should be defined and used in conversational speech as a 
part of every lesson. The suggestions in Chapter 6 to support English learners apply to this 
stage as well. (See also Helman, Bear, Templeton, Invernizzi & Johnston, 2012; Templeton & 
Gehsmann, 2014.)
Many features in the syllables and affixes stage may present some conceptual difficulty for 
English learners. Verb forms may be constructed differently in the native language, particu-
larly inflected verbs. In Spanish, for example, the corresponding equivalent to the English -ing 
is often an infinitive used as an abstract noun (e.g., To sleep is good for you). As a result, English 
learners may have difficulty understanding English sentences that use the -ing form as the 
subject of the sentence (e.g., Sleeping is good for you) or perceiving the pronunciation of -ing or 
-ed at the ends of English words (Swan & Smith, 2001).
Plurals may also be formed differently in the native language. Perceiving and produc-
ing the pronunciations of -s or -es at the end of a word may require explicit attention. 
Learning the small subset of English nouns, verbs and adjectives that involve unusual 
internal ­spelling–sound changes (knife/knives, leave/left, child/children) may not be as simple 
as it seems. Comparatives may also be constructed differently. Instead of being signalled by

spelling changes or different words altogether, comparatives may be signalled by changes 
in accent.
In contrast to many other languages, English spellings are full of double letters that 
might puzzle English learners so studying doubling issues is important. In addition, the 
­compounding and generative aspects of English may not occur in the native language. Com-
pound words like outsmart or windfall may seem strange to English learners, especially when 
they are metaphoric (headstrong) rather than literal (sundown). Similarly, the common use of 
affixes and base words in English to generate new words may be rare in other languages. 
Studying these features in detail is important in helping English learners not only learn the 
spellings and meanings of words but also understand why words work the way they do in 
English.
Word Study Routines and Management
Organising differentiated instructional-level groups for word study is challenging but will best 
serve students’ needs, especially those who are below grade level. The key to finding time for 
meeting with small groups is establishing routines. When students learn weekly word study 
routines, they become responsible for completing much of their work independently (both in 
class and at home) or with partners, leaving you free to work with other small groups. You can 
find more organisation tips in Chapter 3.
The Word Study Lesson Plan in the Syllables and Affixes Stage
We recommend the basic word study lesson plans described in detail in Chapters 3 and 6 for 
this stage as well. Teacher-directed sorts are a good way to introduce new features but open 
sorts involve students in more active thinking. You may be skeptical about using word sorts 
with older students, but experience proves the value of sorts at this level. Even adults who are 
poor spellers enjoy and benefit from hands-on sorting activities (Massengill, 2006). Use the 
following basic routines for sorts:
1.	 Model a sort, or have students sort, and lead them in a discussion of the generalisations 
revealed by the sort as Ms. Radcliffe did at the beginning of this chapter. You should also 
discuss word meanings before or after (in the case of prefixes) sorting.
2.	 Have students sort their own set of words and check their sorts. Sorting the weekly words, 
not once but four or five times across the week, is a valuable routine for students and 
should be at the heart of systematic developmental word study.
3.	 Encourage students to clarify and summarise their understandings with oral and written 
reflections.
4.	 Use extension activities across the week to reinforce and broaden students’ understand-
ings. Activities include homework and working with partners in blind sorts, writing sorts, 
and timed sorts as described in Chapter 3. Games and other activities are another way 
to engage students in further exploration and review of the features they are learning in 
their sorts.
Word Study Notebooks in the Syllables and Affixes Stage
Using word study notebooks in this stage continues to be an easy way to help you and your 
students manage the routines and organisation of word study (see Chapters 3 and 6). Word 
sorts should continue to be recorded in columns of contrasting categories; for example, words 
that drop the e before adding a suffix versus words that do not drop the e. Exemplars can be

added as they are found in word hunts and lists of base words and their derivations can also 
be formed—for example, compete, competing, competed, competitor.
In addition to basic word sorting routines, develop a list of additional word study note-
book activities from which students select when they work independently or for homework. 
Some of these may be more appropriate at times than others, and some can be done to review 
previous lessons.
• Find words that have base words and underline the base word.
• Break words into syllables and underline the accented syllables.
• Make appropriate words on your lists plural or add -ing or -ed.
• Circle or underline any prefixes or suffixes you find in the words on your list.
• Add a prefix and/or suffix, when possible, to words on your list.
• Select five words and use them in sentences or illustrate them.
• Sort your words by parts of speech or subject areas and record your sort.
• Go for speed. Sort your words three times and record your times.
• Select five words to look up in the dictionary. Record the multiple meanings you find for 
each word.
With the increased emphasis on vocabulary learning, you may want to have your stu-
dents divide their word study notebooks into two sections. In Tamara Barnen’s class, the 
first section is titled “Word Study”, and contains the assigned sorts. This section includes 
weekly records of sorts, word hunts, lists generated in small groups, written reflections of 
sorts, timed sorts and writing sorts. The second section 
is  called “Looking into Language” and contains lists of 
words related to themes and units, words categorised by 
parts of speech, graphic organisers and semantic webs of 
content area studies. Students can create synonym and 
antonym wheels in their word study notebook, as shown in 
Figure 7.11. Some teachers include a third section, called a  
“Personal Dictionary”, in which students record words 
they frequently need to use in writing. Because these note-
books will be used constantly, many teachers recommend 
stiff-backed, stitched composition books. Other teachers 
have students use loose leaf paper inserted into either a 
1½-inch, three-ring binder or a less expensive cardboard 
folder with three pre-inserted brads. Notebook paper, 
handouts and worksheets can be added at any time and 
place, making a notebook a more flexible choice.

Several vocabulary activities are described first in this section followed by some dictionary 
activities. The remaining games and activities are designed to extend and reinforce spelling 
sorts. Common Core State Standards for Foundational Skills and Language are listed for 
grades 3, 4 and 5.
Vocabulary Activities
Refer back to vocabulary activities in Chapter 6 (Activities 6.1 to 6.5) that are also appropriate 
for this stage.
	 7.1 	 Semantic Maps
Semantic maps provide an excellent way to activate 
students’ background knowledge on a topic by ask-
ing them to brainstorm words related to a topic, 
which gives you an idea of how much students 
already know. During or after the brainstorming 
session, organise the terms into categories using a 
graphic map such as the one in Figure 7.12. Keep 
the map posted and add new terms throughout the 
unit; “Animals” is the example used here. (CCSS 
Language (3rd–5th) 6)
Procedures
1.	To kick off a unit on animals, write the word 
animals on the board and then asks students 
what words or ideas they associate with ani-
mals. Write the words on a chart; afterward, 
add a few more terms that were not mentioned 
but are important terms in the unit.
2.	Next, talk with the students about different 
ways in which these words may be categorised 
and then arrange the words, with students’ 
input, along the appropriate “leg” (category) 
of the map. This may lead students to think 
of more terms. As they talk and read further, they are growing their understanding of the 
new terms and their relationships to more familiar words and concepts. Have students 
make their own copy of the map as a follow-up activity and add to it over time.
3.	Keep the maps posted throughout the unit, prominently displayed, and have students 
add terms as they move through the unit. Students may also decide that a particular term 
belongs to a different category, and if they can justify it, then they can move the term to 
the new category.
	 7.2 	 Concept Mapping
Concept or word maps focus on a specific term and visually represent its place in a conceptual 
hierarchy using guided questions. In Figure 7.13, the word colony is the focus. When you first 
present the map, the ovals are blank except for the headings: What is it? What is it like? What 
are some examples? What are some non-examples? As you discuss each question, fill the ovals 
with ideas offered by students. (CCSS Language (3rd–5th) 6)

Vocabulary Jeopardy
Students enjoy playing the familiar Jeopardy game 
after brainstorming terms related to a study unit. 
(CCSS Language (3rd–5th) 6)
Materials  Create vocabulary cards for a study 
unit. Start with the vocabulary students generate 
on their own, followed by a scan through texts and 
materials. Determine four to five categories, such 
as “What Comes Out of a Volcano?” with terms 
such as pumice, sulphur, ash, lava and molten rock. 
With these cards, students make a Jeopardy game. 
(Activity 6.18, in Chapter 6 contains a sample game 
board.) Students write items on cards that relate to 
facts and concepts they have studied and write cor-
rect responses on the backside. For example, Mate-
rial that comes out of a volcano could take responses 
that include What is ash? or What is molten rock? 
Teams of students play the game as a whole-class 
vocabulary review of the unit.
	 7.4 	 Word Roots
Examining how Greek and Latin roots combine with affixes helps students build their gen-
erative morphological knowledge. This examination builds on the earlier investigation of 
how base words combine with affixes. This activity, adapted from Templeton & Gehsmann 
(2014), illustrates how the initial presentation and discussion of the Latin roots vis/vid and 
dict may be planned over the course of a week’s instruction. See Table 7.5 for additional 
Greek and Latin roots to explore at this stage. (CCSS Foundational Skills (3rd) 3.b, (3rd–5th)

activities | Syllables and Affixes Stage
Procedures
Day 1.
1.	Share with the students that they’ll begin looking at roots that come from Latin, and 
present the word predict.
Ask the students what it means if they predict something. Then, ask them if they see a 
prefix in predict (pre). What does it mean? (before) Cover pre-, and tell the students that 
they’re left with dict, which is not a word that can stand by itself, but which is the root of 
predict. Explain that dict comes from a Latin word that means “to say or speak”, and that 
when we “predict” something [display the whole word] we say [point to dict] that some-
thing will happen before [point to pre] it actually happens.
If you feel your students don’t need such an explicit walk-through, after you present 
the word predict ask them what they think the root means. Then, ask them that if they 
predict that something will happen, what they think that means.
2.	Display the words vision and revision.
Discuss the meaning of vision, emphasising that it has to do with “seeing.” Then, ask the 
students about revision, and what’s involved during the revision step in writing. Ask them 
to turn to a partner and talk about what they think revision has to do with “seeing.” You 
are guiding them to the realisation that, when they revise their writing, they are ­“seeing” 
[point to vis] it “again” [point to re-].
Day 2.
1.	Display the words from Day 1, and ask the students how they defined dict and vis. Then, 
display the following words:
visit	
dictate
visor	
dictionary
visibility	
contradict
supervise	
dictionary
2.	Ask the students to talk with a partner about how the meaning of each root works in each 
of these words. For example, how does the meaning of “say” or “speak” work in the word 
dictionary? When someone supervises you, what does that have to do with the meaning of 
“see”? Circulate around the room as your students are talking, then bring the whole class 
back together to share their ideas.
Day 3. With vis or dict as a root, have students create a word using any of the prefixes and/or 
suffixes they have explored up to this point. In their word study notebook, have them write 
the word, a definition for it, and—if it can be illustrated—include an illustration. Be sure to 
follow up and have the students share their new words.
Dictionary Skills for 
Syllable and Affixes Spellers
Because of their ease of use, online dictionaries and dictionary apps have the potential to 
bring students more easily and engagingly into the exploration of words. You should base 
instruction in the organisation and use of the dictionary on a print version. See the list of 
resources for dictionaries and other books that will enhance word consciousness on page 292. 
Online versions of dictionaries include a “speaker”-type icon that, when clicked, provides an 
audio pronunciation of the word. For the upper elementary grades, some dictionaries include 
information about a word’s origin in the entry. At the time of this writing, probably the best 
dictionary app for upper elementary students and beyond is the website “Vocabulary.” It is part 
of a more expansive vocabulary instruction app—it provides accessible definitions, context 
sentences, and more importantly, morphologically-related word families for most entry words.

	 292	
CH AP TER 7 
activities | Syllables and Affixes Stage
	 7.5 	 Teaching the Dictionary
Model how to use a dictionary regularly as part of word study lessons, read-alouds, subject 
area lessons, or any time a question might arise that can be answered in a dictionary. (CCSS 
Language (3rd) 2.g, 4.d, (4th–5th) 4.e)
Procedures  Walk through the dictionary features with your students, projecting pages on 
a white board or screen. Introduce the many different kinds of information that they can find:
• Introductory pages addressing how to use the dictionary, including important terminol-
ogy (e.g., guide words, entry words)
• Introduction of special features throughout the dictionary; boxes that address synonyms, 
morphology, word histories
• Pronunciation guides are discussed in the introduction and also usually appear on every 
other page in the dictionary.
• Information presented in each word entry:
• Parts of speech
• Definitions with context sentences that help students make the important distinctions 
for multiple-meaning words
• Syllable breaks
• Accent or stress (sometimes with accent marks and sometimes with bolded letters)
• Inflected forms (e.g., editing, edited)
Here are some resources you might use in your classroom. Often schools have a set of diction-
aries on a rolling cart, but having a few in your classroom is important. Consider a variety of 
dictionaries instead of multiple copies because then students can compare entries and features.

	 7.6 	 Weekly Word Study Notebook Dictionary Assignments
Once students learn how to find things in a dictionary, be sure they get practice doing so by 
assigning activities such as these that require them to use the dictionary. (CCSS Language 
(3rd) 4.d, (4th & 5th) 4.c)
Procedures  Studying in weekly sorts suggests different assignments that students can 
complete in their word study notebooks, such as:
1.	Write 10 of the week’s words according to the syllable breaks in the dictionary (tab-let, 
ta-ble).
2.	Write 10 words and indicate where the accent falls on the stressed syllable. Homographs 
like pro’duce and produce’ are interesting to look up.
3.	List more words that begin with a certain prefix. Caution students to be sure the words 
do indeed contain a prefix. (e.g., reappear has the re- prefix meaning “again”, but reason 
does not).

	
Word Study for Intermediate Readers and Writers	
293
activities | Syllables and Affixes Stage
4.	Select five words to look up and record the definition(s). You might select these yourself or 
let students choose. Finding new definitions for words students already know sometimes 
makes this worthwhile. For example, students are likely to say they already know what 
table means (a piece of furniture) but of course it can mean other things, such as a chart 
or to put something aside.
	 7.7 	 Dictionary Bees
These drills are designed to help students develop skills in using the dictionary but keep them 
fast and fun. You can make these competitive or not. If one student is consistently the fastest 
make that student an announcer or referee so others can be first. (CCSS Language (3rd) 4.d, 
(4th–5th) 4.c)
Materials  Every student should have an elementary dictionary.
Procedures  Here are several different drills:
• How many turns? Announce a word for everyone to find using the fewest number of 
page turns. Remind students to first think about where the word is likely to come in the 
alphabetic sequence and then to use guidewords at the top. Tell them to keep track of 
how many tries it takes. Model this for the students first, and then do it yourself at the 
same time they do; after a while they might beat you at the game! Students can work in 
teams—one keeps score of the number of times the page is turned by the other student.
• Look up the spelling. Announce a word that students are not likely to know how to spell 
(e.g., legitimate or foreign) and challenge them to find the word in the dictionary. The first 
one to find the word, write it on a whiteboard or card and hold up the written word is 
the winner. Even if students know how to spell the word they cannot write it until they 
find the word.
• Find information. Write an unfamiliar word on the board (perhaps one from an upcoming 
unit in science or social studies) and challenge them to find the definition, part of speech, 
pronunciation or origin.
Spelling Activities  These activities and games are designed to reinforce the word 
study introduced first in sorting activities. There are many games described in previous chap-
ters that are adaptable for use with the features studied in this stage.
1.	The Spelling Game (Activity 6.13, in Chapter 6) can be used with any feature, as it 
involves asking a player to spell a word before moving on the board. The word cards from 
any sort can be used as the playing cards for the game.
2.	Go Fish (5.28, in Chapter 5), and The Racetrack Game (6.12), “I’m Out” (6.14), Jeopardy 
(6.18), Declare Your Category! (6.20), Word Study Uno (6.22) and Homophone Rummy 
(6.23) in Chapter 6 work well with the many features in this stage that have three or more 
categories: syllable patterns, vowel patterns in stressed syllables, unaccented final syllables, 
silent consonants, hard and soft g and c, prefixes, suffixes and so on.
	 7.8 	 Compound Word Activities
When examining compound words, consider the difficulty of the base words they use. Cupcake 
and outfit consist of two words that have common one-syllable patterns mastered in the within 
word pattern stage, but cheeseburger and grandparent include two-syllable words that students may 
find challenging to spell (burger and parent). Following are ways you can explore these words. 
(CCSS Foundational Skills (3rd) 3, 3.c, (4th–5th) 3, 3.a, Language (3rd) 2.e, (4th) 2.9, 4, (5th) 2.e)
• Share some common compound words with the students (e.g., cookbook and bedroom). 
Discuss their meanings, pointing out how each word in the compound contributes to the 
meaning of the whole word. You might ask students to draw pictures for illustration. For 
example, a student might draw a horse and a shoe, and then a horseshoe.
Adaptable  
for Other Stages

	 294	
CH AP TER 7 
activities | Syllables and Affixes Stage
• Using the compound word list in Appendix E, prepare word sorts that can be sorted in a 
variety of ways. The sort can focus on shared words (headlight, headband, headache, head-
phones versus football, foothill, footprint, footstep). You might also conduct concept sorts; for 
example, words that have to do with people (anyone, someone, somebody, anybody) or things 
we find outdoors (sunlight, aeroplane, waterfall, airport).
• Have students cut a set of compound words apart. Then challenge them to create as many 
new compound words as they can. Some words will be legitimate words (mailbox); others 
will be words that do not formally exist but could (bookbox). Have students share and dis-
cuss their words. Students might then write sentences using the pseudo-words and draw 
pictures that illustrate the meaning of each.
• Give students a word such as fire, man, head, book or rain and challenge them to see how 
many related compound words they can brainstorm (fireplace, firefighter, cookbook, bookmark, 
rainbow, raincoat). Teams compete to see who can come up with the longest list in a variation 
of Scattergories (6.21). Let the team with the longest list read it aloud. Everyone crosses 
out any word that another team has also thought of. Only words that no other team thinks 
of earn points. Repeat until every team has had a chance to read the words remaining on 
their list. Remember that each part of the word must stand alone as a free morpheme.
• Challenge the more advanced students at this stage to sort compound words according to 
their underlying structure (Bravo, Hiebert & Pearson, 2005). For example, noun + noun 
(headlight, wasteland); noun + verb (windswept, handshake); adjective + noun (anyplace, hardwood).
• Create a year-long class collection of compound words on a chart or in word study note-
books. This collection can include hyphenated words (good-bye, show-off, push-up, etc.).
	 7.9 	 Double Scoop
This board game helps students review and master consonant doubling and e-drop when add-
ing inflectional endings. It is appropriate for small groups of two to four students. (CCSS FS: 
(3rd) 3.a, L: (3rd) 1.e, (4th) L: 2, 2.d)
Materials  Prepare a game board as shown in Figure 7.14 and write sentences, such 
as the examples below, on small cards to go into a deck. You will also need playing pieces, a

The bunny was hopping down the road.	
I was hoping to get new shoes.
The cat is sunning herself on the chair.	
He is diving into the pool.
Brittany shopped at her favourite store.	
She glided across the ice.
Procedures
1.	Players put their pieces on the sun to start. Player 2 (the reader) reads a sentence card and 
repeats the underlined word.
2.	Player 1 (the writer) spells the underlined word under the correct heading on the white-
board or paper.
3.	Player 2 checks the answer by comparing it with the sentence card. If it is correct, player 
1 spins and moves that number of spaces on the playing board.
4.	Play then moves to the next student, who must spell and sort the underlined word given 
by the next player. If there are only two players, they simply switch roles.
5.	The first player to reach the double scoop of ice cream wins.
	7.10 	 Freddy, the Hopping, Diving, Jumping Frog
In this board game for two to four players, students review generalisations for adding -ing. 
(CCSS Foundational Skills (3rd) 3.a, Language (3rd) 1.e, (4th) 2, 2.d)
Materials  Create a game board using one or more of the follow-the-path templates in 
Appendix F, or by arranging green circles in a path to represent lily pads much like the game 
board for the Hopping Frog game in Activity 5.29 in Chapter 5. On each space, write either 
Double, e-Drop or Nothing. Prepare playing cards by writing a variety of words with -ing added 
until there is an equal number for each rule (e.g., hopping, diving, jumping). Use words that 
students have been sorting and add more words from the syllables and affixes word lists in 
Appendix D. You can also add penalty or bonus cards such as the following:
You have the strongest legs. Jump ahead to the next lily pad.
You are the fastest swimmer. Skip 2 spaces.
Your croaking made me lose sleep. Move back 2 spaces.
You ate too many flies. Move back 2 spaces.
Procedures
1.	Place playing cards face-down and put playing pieces on the starting space.
2.	Each player draws a card, reads the card aloud and moves to the closest space that matches. 
For example, if the card says hopping, the player moves to the nearest space marked Double.
3.	A player who draws a penalty or bonus card must follow the directions on the card.
4.	The winner is the first to reach the home lily pad.
Variations  Players can draw for each other, read the word aloud and the player whose 
turn it is must spell the word correctly before moving to the appropriate space. You can write 
uninflected forms on cards (hop, jump, dive), and have players write how the word should be 
spelled before moving to the appropriate place. Include an answer sheet with words in alpha-
betical order to check if there is disagreement.
	7.11 	 Slap Jack
This card game for two people may be used to contrast open- and closed-syllable words as 
represented by any of the syllable spelling patterns (V/CV vs. VCCV; V/CV vs. VC/V). The 
object of the game is for one player to win all 52 cards. (CCSS Foundational Skills (3rd–5th) 
3, 3.a, Language (3rd) 2.f, (4th) 2, 2.d)

	 296	
CH AP TER 7 
activities | Syllables and Affixes Stage
Materials  On 52 small cards, write the words that you want to be contrasted. For 
example, 26 words that follow the open-syllable VCV pattern (pilot, human) and 26 that fol-
low the closed-syllable VCCV pattern (funny, basket); see word lists in Appendix E. Write the 
words on both ends of the cards so that neither player has to read the words upside down.
Procedures
1.	Deal the cards one at a time until the deck is gone. Players keep their cards face-down in 
a pile in front of them.
2.	Each player turns a card face-up in a common pile at the same time. When two words with 
either open syllables or closed syllables are turned up together, the first player to slap the 
pile takes all the cards in the common pile and adds them at the bottom of his or her pile. 
Turning cards and slapping must be done with the same hand.
3.	A player who slaps the common pile when there are not two open- or closed-syllable 
words must give both cards to the other player.
4.	Play continues until one player has all the cards. If time runs out, the winner is the player 
with the most cards.
Variations  Additional syllable juncture patterns may be added to the deck—for exam-
ple, closed-syllable VCV (cabin, water) and VV (riot, diet). Word cards could be prepared for 
any feature that has two or three categories, such as inflected forms with -ed that players would 
slap when both words represent e-drop, double or no change.
	7.12 	 Double Crazy Eights
This activity for two to three players is based on the traditional card game Crazy Eights and 
works well to review vowel patterns, syllable juncture and accented syllables. The object of the 
game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand. (CCSS Foundational Skills (3rd–5th) 3, 3.a, 
Language (3rd) 2.f, (4th) 2, 2.d)
Materials  Prepare 40 or more word cards comprising four suits and four Crazy Eight 
cards designated by the numeral 8. In this example, words with long-a are used: rainbow, 
painter, raisin, complain, remain, explain, trainer, daisy, exclaim, regain, refrain, waiter, crayon, 
mayor, maybe, decay, today, payment, player, prayer, delay, hooray, dismay, replay, grateful, bracelet, 
mistake, parade, amaze, basement, escape, vibrate, baseball, insane, replace, neighbour, weightless, 
freighter, eighteen, eighty.
Procedures
1.	The dealer gives each player eight cards. The remaining cards become the draw pile. The 
dealer turns the top card of the draw pile over and places it beside the deck. This card 
becomes the starter card and is the first card in the discard pile.
2.	The player to the left of the dealer begins by placing a card that matches the starter card 
onto the discard pile. Matches may be made in three ways:
• By pattern: crayon/hooray or waiter/complain
• By accent: first syllable trainer/prayer or second syllable decay/complain
• By unaccented syllable: daisy/eighty or payment/basement
3.	With a Crazy Eight card, the player can change the suit to anything he or she chooses.
4.	If the player does not have a match, he or she must draw from the draw pile until one is 
found.
5.	If all the cards in the draw pile are used up, reserve the top card from the discard pile, 
shuffle the rest of the cards, and place them face-down on the table as the new draw pile.
6.	Play continues until one player has discarded all of his or her cards.
Variations  This game can be adapted simply by making up a new deck using words that 
focus on another spelling feature. Remember that the deck must have four suits and allow for 
matching by at least two different elements.

	7.13 	 Pair Them Up
In this version of Memory or Concentration, students match up unusual plurals. (CCSS Lan-
guage (3rd) 1.b)
Materials  Create 11 sets of cards using word pairs such as the following: wife/wives, leaf/
leaves, life/lives, wolf/wolves, knife/knives, man/men, woman/women, mouse/mice, goose/geese, tooth/
teeth, child/children. Make one card each of fish, sheep and deer.
Procedures
1.	Shuffle the cards and lay them all out face-down in a 5 × 5 array.
2.	Each player turns over two cards at a time. If the cards make a match, the player keeps 
them and turns over two more.
3.	If fish, sheep or deer are turned over, there is no match and the player automatically gets to 
keep the card and go again.
Variations  Create a similar game for two-syllable homophones (berry, bury) or for 
irregular past-tense pairs: sleep/slept, slide/slid, shine/shone, freeze/froze, say/said, think/thought 
and so on.
	7.14 	 The Apple and the Bushel
The purpose of this board game is to give students added practice in differentiating between 
-le and -el endings. (CCSS Language (3rd) 2.e, (4th) 
2.d, (5th) 2.e)
Materials  Prepare the Apple and Bushel game 
board (see Figure 7.15) and word cards with words 
that end in -el and -le (bushel, angel, apple, angle).
Procedures
1.	Players draw for each other and read the word 
aloud.
2.	Players must spell the word orally or in writing 
correctly and then move the marker to the near-
est -le or -el ending that spells the word.
3.	The game continues until one player reaches the 
bushel. (Note: To get in the bushel, an -el word 
must be drawn. A player who draws an -le word 
must move backward and continue playing from 
that space.)
Variation  Add words that end with -il (pencil) 
and -al (pedal).
	7.15 	 Prefix Spin
This game for two to four players reinforces the idea that prefixes and base words can be com-
bined in different ways. Let students play this after they have sorted words with the featured 
prefixes. (CCSS Foundational Skills (3rd–5th) 3.a)
Materials  Make a spinner using the directions in Appendix F. Divide the spinner into six 
sections and write each of these prefixes in a section: mis-, pre-, un-, dis- and re- (use re- twice 
because it can be used in twice as many words as the others; see Figure 7.16). Prepare a deck of 24 
cards with the following base words written on them: judge, match, take, wrap, set, test, view, charge, 
pay, able, like, form, count, place, use, order, cover and pack (you can duplicate the last six to enlarge

the deck; each can combine with three of the prefixes—for example, 
misplace, replace and displace). Include paper and pencil for each player 
to record their matches. You may also want to include a list of allow-
able words to solve disputes. Matches include the following:
miscount, misjudge, mismatch, misplace, mistake, misuse, 
prejudge, preset, pretest, preview, preform, preorder, prepay, 
recount, rematch, replace, retake, reuse, reset, retest, review, 
recharge, reform, ­reorder, repay, recover, repack, rewrap, 
unable, uncover, ­unlike, unpack, unwrap, discount, displace, 
discharge, disorder, disable, discover, dislike, disuse
Procedures
1.	Turn the base word cards face-down in a deck in the centre of 
the playing area. Turn up one card at a time.
2.	The first player spins for a prefix (such as un-). If the prefix 
can be added to the base word to form a real word (such as 
unwrap), the player takes the card and records the whole word 
on paper.
3.	If the first player spins a prefix that cannot be added (such as 
mis-), the next player spins and hopes to land on a prefix that 
will work with the base word. This continues until someone can 
form a word.
4.	A new base word is turned up for the next player and the game continues.
5.	The winner is the player who has the most base word cards at the end of the game.
Variations
1.	Use two spinners with suffixes written on the second one, such as -s, -ed, -ing and -able. 
Award a bonus point when a player can use both the prefix and suffix with a base word, as 
in replaceable or discovering.
2.	Make two sets of cards with the base words and pass out four words to each player that 
are laid out face-up. Each player spins and tries to match the prefix with one of the words 
he or she has. A word that is successfully matched can be turned over in a point pile and 
another card drawn so the player always has four cards for possible matches. This works 
well with prefixes that might not be as common as the original five.
	7.16 	 Homophone Solitaire
Building on the traditional game of Solitaire, this simple card game requires flexible thinking 
and versatile attention to words. Word cards are matched by homophone, syllable pattern or 
whether the homophonic spelling change is in the stressed or unstressed syllable. The object 
of the game is to end up with all the words in one pile. (CCSS Foundational Skills (3rd–5th) 
3, Language (3rd–5th) 4)
Materials  You will need 52 word cards using two-syllable homophones. The cards are 
composed of two suits: (a) homophones in the accented syllable, and (b) homophones in the 
unaccented syllable. There are 13 pairs of matching homophones from each suit. (See the 
homophone list in Appendix E.)
Procedures
1.	Shuffle the deck, then turn one card over at a time. Say the word, observe the pattern and 
place the card down, face-up.
FIGURE 7.16   Prefix Spin

activities | Syllables and Affixes Stage
2.	Turn over the next card. Place it on top of the previous card if it matches by any of the 
following three features:
• Exact homophone (e.g., alter/altar).
• Syllable pattern: VCCV doublet (e.g., mussel could be placed on lesson); VCCV differ-
ent (e.g., canvas could be placed on incite); open V/CV (e.g., miner could be placed on 
rumour); closed VC/V (e.g., baron could be placed on profit).
• Spelling change in the accented or unaccented syllable. For example, suppose sender 
was the last card played; the homophone for sender is cinder—the spelling change in 
the sender/cinder homophone pair occurs in the accented syllable. If a student is hold-
ing the card morning, she could place it on sender because the homophone for morning 
is mourning, which also has the spelling change in the accented syllable. Alternately, if 
the student is holding the card presents, he could play it on miner because the homo-
phone for presents is presence and the homophone for miner is minor—the spelling 
change occurs in the unstressed syllables.
3.	If there is no match, place the card to the right of the last card played.
4.	Continue play in this way, placing cards with no matches to the right of the last card 
played. Stacks may be picked up and consolidated at any time. The top card played on a 
stack determines the movement.
5.	Players may move back no more than four stacks for play.
6.	Play continues until the entire deck is played. Then shuffle and play again!

The Derivational Relations Stage

301
Writing the misspelled word COMPISITION on the board, Mr. Ramirez begins: “I’d like to point something out to you: 
Words that are related in meaning are often related in spelling as well. For example [pointing to COMPISITION], 
everything is correct in this word except for the letter i in the second syllable. However, there’s a related word in 
meaning and spelling that actually provides a clue to the correct spelling. Any ideas what this word might be?”
No one responds. Mr. Ramirez continues. “Well, let’s look at this word [writes compose directly above COMPISI-
TION]. Are compose and composition related in meaning? Yes, they are! Can you hear the long o sound in compose? 
You know how to spell this sound, and because compose and composition are related in meaning, the o in compose 
is the clue to the spelling of what we call the schwa sound in composition.
“Keeping this fact in mind can help you spell a word you may not be sure of, like composition. Why? Because 
schwas don’t give you any clue to the spelling—they can be spelled with any of the vowel letters. You’ve got a pow-
erful strategy you can use, though: thinking of a related word, like compose, gives you a clue.
“Let’s try another one. Here’s a misspelling I’ve seen a lot.” He writes OPPISITION on the board. “Is there a word 
that is related in meaning and spelling that can give you a clue about how to spell the schwa sound?” He points to 
the i in the second syllable of OPPISITION.
There are a few seconds of silence before Darci tentatively responds, “Oppose?”
“Could be! Let’s check it out.” He writes oppose directly above OPPISITION. “We can clearly hear the sound that 
o in the second syllable of oppose stands for, and sure enough, opposition comes from oppose—they’re similar in 
meaning—so Darci is right! Oppose gives us the clue for remembering the spelling of opposition. This week we will 
be looking at more words that are related in meaning and spelling as well. By looking at words that are related to 
ones you’re trying to spell, you will discover a helpful clue to the spelling.” ●
D
erivational relations describes the type of word knowledge that more advanced readers and writers 
develop in the final stage. The term emphasises how spelling and vocabulary knowledge at this stage 
grow primarily through processes of derivation—from a single base word or word root, we derive 
related words by adding prefixes and suffixes. Though students start exploring these processes in the within 
word pattern and syllables and affixes stages, their understanding expands and becomes much more elaborate at 
the derivational relations stage. Exploring words at the derivational relations stage draws on extensive experi-
ences in reading and writing (e.g., Berninger, Abbott, Nagy & Carlisle, 2009; Cunningham & Stanovich, 2003;  
Mahony, Singson & Mann, 2000; Smith, 1998). The word sorts that students do at this level, together with their 
exploration of words, generally have more to do with vocabulary development than simply spelling development.
We will visit the sixth- and seventh-grade classrooms of Jorge Ramirez and Kelly Rubero several times 
in this chapter. Here, Mr. Ramirez illustrates how a teacher can guide students to understand how thinking 
about the base word and its meaning can be a clue to spelling a word.
Development of Students in the Derivational 
Relations Stage
We find students in the derivational relations stage in upper elementary, middle school, high school and 
into adulthood. Students at this level are fairly competent spellers, so the errors they make are “high 
level”, requiring a more advanced foundation of spelling and vocabulary. However, misspellings such as 
INDITEMENT, ALLEDGED, IRELEVANT and ACCOMODATE occur even among highly skilled and 

	 302	
CH AP TER 8 
­accomplished readers and writers. (Indeed, the persistence of such misspellings leads many 
adults to lament that, though they are good readers, they are “terrible” spellers!) Exploring 
the logic underlying correct spellings of these words not only helps us learn and remember 
the correct spelling but, more importantly, leads to a deeper understanding and appreciation 
of how words work. This understanding and appreciation leads in turn to the growth and dif-
ferentiation of concepts—to vocabulary development.
Reading in the Derivational Relations Stage
The type of word knowledge that underlies advanced reading and writing includes an ever-
expanding conceptual foundation and the addition of words that represent these concepts. 
Advanced readers can explore the Greek and Latin word elements that are the important 
morphemes out of which thousands of words are constructed. This is a generative process 
(Templeton, 2011/2012; Templeton et al., 2015), and linguists estimate that 60 to 80 percent 
of English vocabulary is generated by combining roots, prefixes and suffixes (Nagy & Ander-
son, 1984). Over 90 percent of science and technology vocabulary is generated through this 
process (Green, 2008). Students who understand this generative process are in a position to 
analyse and understand the unfamiliar domain-specific academic vocabulary they will encoun-
ter in the reading materials of middle school and high school. Reading is the primary means 
by which students gain access to these words; the words simply do not occur as often in oral 
language. The explicit, generative and deep study of written vocabulary adds to students’ read-
ing experience and conceptual development.
Readers at the derivational stage develop their understanding of the “meaning” layer 
of orthography quite extensively. This understanding, based primarily on morphological 
knowledge, supports their perception and identification of polysyllabic words. During the 
reading process at this stage, in addition to the syllabic chunks that intermediate readers and 
students in the syllables and affixes stage find in longer words, the advanced reader picks up  
morphemic or meaning chunks as well (Taft, 2003; Templeton, 1992). For example, an inter-
mediate reader attempting to read the word morphology analyses it syllable by syllable, pick-
ing up the letter sequences mor-pho-lo-gy. The 
advanced reader likely uses morphemic analysis, 
picking up on the meaning chunks in morph-ology, 
which cross syllable boundaries and offer insights 
into the meaning of the word (morph = structure,  
ology = study of).
Writing in the Derivational 
Relations Stage
Proficient writers have the potential to use the 
forms and functions—structures and purposes—
of different genres. Together with their expanding 
vocabularies, this knowledge of form and function 
helps to inform their voice, or stance, which in 
turn guides their word choice when they write 
and revise. This understanding and sensitivity is 
often evident in their informal writing as well, 
such as in journals. Figure 8.1 presents an excerpt 
from a sixth-grader’s response journal; her lit-
erature response group has been reading Scott 
O’Dell’s Island of the Blue Dolphins. Her writing 
shows literary insights (“Every once in a while, 
the book gives you hints about things that will 
happen . . .”) and a humorous stance ­(“Sometimes 
this book is Eerrie with a capital E”).

Vocabulary Learning in the Derivational Relations Stage
Through wide reading and study in specific content domains, students’ growth in general 
­academic, as well as domain-specific, vocabulary accelerates dramatically during the deriva-
tional relations stage. It is important to note the distinction between word-specific and gen-
erative vocabulary instruction at this stage. There are effective activities for teaching a deep 
understanding of the concepts that specific words represent, which has been the traditional 
objective of vocabulary instruction (Beck, McKeown & Kucan, 2013). It is equally important, 
however, to teach about words—the generative morphological processes by which meaningful 
word parts combine (Bowers & Kirby, 2010; Nagy, 2007; Templeton, 2011/2012; Templeton 
et al., 2015). Although students are introduced to the base word/word root distinction during 
the syllables and affixes stage, their understanding of the generative features of Greek and 
Latin affixes and roots really takes off during the derivational relations stage.
Flanigan et al. (2011) note that developing students’ generative understanding is like 
the old saying, “Give someone a fish, they can eat for a day. Teach them to fish, they can 
eat for a lifetime.” Word-specific instruction gives students the fish; generative instruc-
tion teaches them how to fish. For this reason, most of this chapter emphasises generative 
instruction—giving students the keys to fully unlock the meaning code in the structure of 
English words.
Word sorts continue to be an effective context in which meaning and structure are 
explored. We will examine the relationships between spelling and meaning in some depth, 
because these relationships are generative and apply to most words in the English language. 
Word sorts also help students remember the spellings and meanings of specific words.
Concept Sorts.  An excellent framework for developing word-specific knowledge as 
well as relationships among the concepts that the words represent, concept sorts help activate 
background knowledge and generate interest in and questions about the topic. Based on the 
students’ level of background knowledge, concept sorts may be closed or open, depending on 
whether categories are defined. Usually, the words to be sorted are the key vocabulary and 
important related words for a topic of study.
For example, the following vocabulary terms are for a science unit focusing on “Heavenly 
Bodies:”
planet star sun moon asteroid comet meteorite meteoroid nebula white dwarf supernova 
black hole neutron star galaxy
The teacher has selected words the students know (planet, star, moon, sun), as well as some 
of the new words for the unit (asteroid, neutron star, white dwarf). Because the students have 
some background knowledge about space and astronomy, the teacher asks them to work with 
a partner to see how many different ways they can think of to sort the words or concepts, 
producing the following possibilities:
• In or out of our solar system
• Single bodies or members of a group
• Generating light or reflecting light
The following is one possible Single Body/Member of a group concept sort.
Single Body
Member of a Group
Not Sure
sun
star
asteroid
comet
supernova
black hole
galaxy
neutron star
planet
moon
meteorite
meteoroid
nebula
white dwarf

	 304	
CH AP TER 8 
As students discuss the sort, they can move the words and concepts in one category to 
any of the other two categories. In the process, more background information is engaged and 
uncertainties clarified.
Dictionaries.  Because students use dictionaries frequently in the derivational relations 
stage, ensure that they understand the features — pronunciation guides, multiple definitions, 
sample sentences, parts of speech and so on (see Chapter 7). Have at least one dictionary in 
the classroom that has information about word origins. This information is usually in brackets 
at the end of a main entry. Online dictionaries, such as OneLook and YourDictionary, are also 
useful. The following materials should always be readily available to students:
• Intermediate and collegiate dictionaries; enough copies for six to eight students to work 
in a small group
• Thesaurus collection: enough for six to eight students in small-group and whole class study
• Several word origin (etymological) dictionaries and root books (see next section)
Older students are often interested in the history of dictionaries. An excellent book that is 
accessible to many middle-grade advanced readers and writers is Joshua Kendall’s The Forgot-
ten Founding Father: Noah Webster’s Obsession and the Creation of an American Culture (2010). 
Books that provide fascinating insights to share with students as they explore dictionaries 
more extensively are Simon Winchester’s The Professor and the Madman: A Tale of Murder, 
Insanity and the Making of the Oxford English Dictionary (1998) and The Meaning of Everything: 
The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary (2003).
Continue to model your own use and curiosity about dictionaries, including the seren-
dipitous discoveries you can make—this helps develop your students’ word consciousness. 
When looking up graph, for example, a note about grafitti caught seventh-grade teacher Kelly 
Rubero’s eye and she was delighted to learn (and share with her students) that graffiti is an 
Italian plural form of graffito and both, like graph, are related to Greek graphein (to write). 
While electronic dictionaries have their place, one advantage of books is that students end up 
browsing the page and coming across other interesting facts about words.
Keep dictionaries handy when introducing word sorts so that students can check the 
accuracy of their morphological analyses. For example, after sorting words by the root spec 
and hypothesising that it means “to look”, students were unsure about how speculate fit that 
meaning. After looking at definitions and illustrative uses of speculate in several dictionaries 
they decided that one would be likely to look closely at something in the process of thinking 
about it or before taking a chance on buying it (Flanigan, Templeton & Hayes, 2012).
Word Origins.  Exploring dictionaries and the information they provide leads into the 
more sustained study of word origins. Exploring word origins and the processes of creating 
words provides a powerful knowledge base for learning vocabulary and spelling, as well as for 
facilitating more effective reading and writing. Etymology, the study of word origins (from 
the Greek etymon, meaning “true sense of a word”), may develop into a lifelong fascination for 
many students. As you engage students in examining word roots and affixes, the groundwork 
for more focused exploration of etymology and a lifelong love of word histories and ­vocabulary.
Students develop a real sense of how words work at this level as well as a general sense of 
how words can move through history. Ms. Rubero often reminds her students of the depth of 
their insights as they engage in this type of exploration during word study. Using resources 
like those presented here, and particularly in Shipley’s Origins of English Words (2001), stu-
dents can explore the derivations of words. These explorations invariably bring a wealth of 
additional words and relationships to students’ attention. In Shipley, for example, the entry 
for peter, the original Indo-European root for “father”, explains how the Romans created the 
name of the god Jupiter from the Greeks’ Zeus + peter. Although all students benefit from 
these types of investigations, more verbally advanced students in the intermediate grades often 
become true “word nerds” once they are initiated. Studying word roots extends into the even 
more ancient Indo-European root forms (Templeton et al., 2015), a topic touched on briefly 
in the very last activity in this chapter.

Online Resources.  The number of vocabulary- and word-themed websites seems to 
be increasing exponentially. Some of our favourites are listed in Resource Connections: Web 
Resources about Words (page 307). One in particular, Visual Thesaurus, offers significant 
potential for students’ explorations. Users type in a word, and the word is then presented in a 
“Thinkmap” web that displays the meaning relationships shared by the target word or concept 
and other terms. Clicking on any word in these web-based resources reveals definitions and 
examples in context, as well as a new web of relationships. Figure 8.2 shows the thinkmap for 
the word tranquil. Clicking on the node above tranquil reveals the definition as it applies to 
individuals; clicking on the lower node describes tranquil in relation to a body of water. Figure 8.3 
displays the thinkmap for lithosphere, an important term in a science unit on the four earth 
systems. Exploring the different nodes and the word or conceptual relationships they reveal 
provides students with a framework for exploring in breadth and depth an understanding of the 
lithosphere and its relationship to the other three earth systems, as well as their characteristics 
and functions. Another very helpful resource in the website is the “Vocabgrabber”, an excellent 
tool for helping analyse the type, frequency and relevance of the vocabulary in any text you use.
We must offer a cautionary note about any ­website that we recommend: although they are 
powerful tools, they do not know your students. How you use them and the information they 
provide ultimately rests on your judgement. For example, though “Vocabgrabber” will gener-
ate lists of important vocabulary words, which words you include is based on your judgement 
and knowledge of your students.
You can find additional ideas about word-specific activities for derivational relations stu-
dents in Resource Connections: Teacher Resources for Word-Specific Vocabulary Activities.
Although the spelling of a word may appear odd, understanding its origin provides the 
most powerful key to remembering the spelling. Knowing that so many words have come 
from mythology, literature and historical events and famous figures provides important back-
ground knowledge for students’ reading in the various subject matter domains. The books and 
websites listed in Resource Connections: Resources for Word Study—Greek and Latin Ele-
ments, and Word Origins (this and previous page) also help. To stimulate students’ curiosity 
about word origins, read aloud excerpts from such books when you have a few extra minutes.
Another way to add interest to studying word origins is to talk about words we imported 
from other countries. A significant number of words have recently come into American 
English from other contemporary languages, primarily Spanish (quesadilla, chili con carne) but 
some from French (bistro, à la carte) and Italian (al fresco, cappuccino) as well. As you may have 
guessed, such words initially turn up on our menus (Venezky, 1999). Given enough time, such 
“borrowed” words or “loanwords” become so familiar they don’t strike us as foreign: algebra 
and algorithm from Arabic, adventure and marine from French, husband and window from Scan-
dinavian, canyon and ranch from Spanish, tomato and chocolate from Native American languages. 
A popular classroom activity is to post a large world map on the wall and display words accord-
ing to their country of origin. For example, where would you post the word segue?

Orthographic Development in the Derivational 
Relations Stage
Table 8.1 summarises some of the characteristics of spellers in this stage. At first glance, 
misspellings at the derivational relations stage appear similar to those at the syllables and 
affixes stage. Errors occur at the syllable juncture and with the vowel in unaccented or 
unstressed syllables. In contrast to the two-syllable words in which these errors occur at the 
syllables and affixes stage, derivational relations errors occur primarily in words of three or 
more syllables.
The Upper-Level Spelling Inventory (USI) is useful for collecting spelling errors for 
analysis and better identifying the spelling-meaning “landscape” that students are exploring. 
Specific spelling errors characteristic of this stage fall into three main categories:
1.	 Polysyllabic words often have unaccented syllables in which the vowel is reduced to the 
schwa sound, as in the second syllable of opposition. Remembering the root from which this 
word is derived (oppose) often helps students choose the correct vowel.
2.	 Several suffixes have different spellings despite similar pronunciations. For example, -tion 
in opposition is easily confused with -ian (clinician) and -sion (tension), which sound the same.
3.	 Other errors occur in the feature known as an absorbed or assimilated prefix. The pre-
fix in opposition originally comes from ob, but because the word root starts with the ­letter

p (pos), the spelling has changed to reflect an easier pronunciation. (Try pronouncing ob-
position—it’s awkward to move rapidly from a /b/ to a /p/ sound.)
The Spelling–Meaning Connection
The spelling–meaning connection is another way of referring to the generative understanding 
of words—the significant role that morphology plays in the spelling system and in learning 
vocabulary. As we begin to explore spelling–meaning relationships, we help students become 
aware of this principle as it applies in English. Words that are related in meaning are often 
related in spelling as well, despite changes in sound (Chomsky, 1970; Templeton, 1983, 1992, 
2012). As Mr. Ramirez pointed out to his students, this supports a powerful spelling strategy. 
If you do not know how to spell a word, try to think of a word that is similar in meaning and 
structure that you do know how to spell. Conversely, if you are unsure of the meaning of a 
word, or if you want to expand your vocabulary, think of words that are spelled alike and look 
for a meaning that is common across them. This consistency presents an excellent opportunity 
to integrate spelling and vocabulary instruction.
Being aware of logical spelling–meaning connections that apply to most words in the 
English language results in far more productive and reassuring word learning than the tradi-
tional one-word-at-a-time approach—demonstrating the “teach someone how to fish” apho-
rism here as well. For example, a general academic vocabulary word like paradigmatic is better 
learned, understood and retained when related to paradigm, as well as providing a helpful clue 
to remembering the silent g in paradigm; in the same way, mnemonic can be related to amnesia 
and amnesty, all of which have to do with memory.
Affixes.  Students first explore the spelling–meaning connection when studying affixes in the 
syllables and affixes stage, and review it in derivational relations with more advanced vocabulary 
and additional affixes. Table 8.2 presents the most frequently occurring prefixes and suffixes.

Adding -ION to Words.  The suffix pronounced “shun” can be spelled several ways, 
as in protection, invasion, admission and musician. Hundreds of words in English end with this 
suffix, which means “act, process or the result of an act or process”. Usually a verb is changed 
to a noun by adding -ion, as in elect to election or create to creation. In the case of -ian it means 
“person” (clinician, dietician). This suffix affects sounds in interesting ways—it sometimes 
causes a final consonant sound to alternate (as in detect/detection, in which the /t/becomes/sh/) 
or a vowel to alternate (as in decide/decision).
The generalisations governing changes in spelling when this suffix is added are complex, 
but you can address them early in the derivational relations stage because there are so many 
familiar words to examine. In order to spell the /shən/ suffix (the symbol ə stands for the 
“schwa” sound, which is the least-accented vowel sound in a word), consider the ending of the 
base word. The following list summarises the generalisations about this suffix and the order 
in which they can be introduced and explored.
1.	 Base words that end in -ct or -ss, just add -ion (traction, expression)
2.	 Base words that end in -ic, add -ian (magic/magician)
3.	 Base words that end in -te, drop the e and add -ion (translate/translation)
4.	 Base words that end in -ce, drop the e and add -tion (reduce/reduction)
5.	 Base words that end in -de and -it, drop those letters and add -sion or -ssion (decide/decision, 
admit/admission)
6.	 Sometimes -ation is added to the base word, which 
causes little trouble for spellers because it can be 
heard (transport/transportation)
In Figure 8.4, students first pair the base word (the 
verb) with its derivative (the noun) and then group the 
pairs by the spelling patterns to determine the generalisa-
tion (e.g., words ending in de, drop the de and add sion). 
Students should also look for the type of vowel or conso-
nant alternations that have occurred.
Sound Alternations
An excellent way to explore the spelling–meaning connection is to examine more directly 
how the sound of vowels and consonants change or alternate in related words. Despite these 
changes in sounds, the spelling often remains the same to preserve the meaning connection.

Consonant Alternation.  Consonants that are silent in one word are sometimes 
“sounded” in a related word, as in the words sign, signal and signature. Other times, as we’ve 
just seen, the pronunciation of consonants changes when a suffix is added to words. Listen 
how the sound of the t in prevent changes in prevention. The t now has the /sh/ sound. Other 
examples include /s/ to /sh/ in compress to compression, and /k/ to /sh/ in magic to magician. This 
phenomenon is known as consonant alternation.
Begin examining consonant alternation with silent/sounded pairs such as bomb/bombard, 
crumb/crumble, muscle/muscular, hasten/haste, soften/soft. As students move through the grades, 
they will encounter more words that follow this pattern, thereby expanding their vocabular-
ies (column/columnist, solemn/solemnity, assign/assignation). Rather than trying to remember 
the spelling of one silent consonant in one word, students learn the strategy: try to think of a 
word related in spelling and meaning; you may get a clue from the consonant that is sounded.
Vowel Alternation and Reduction.  In the pair revise/revision, the long-i in the 
base word (revise) changes to a short-i in the derived word (revision). Vowel alternation occurs 
in related words in which the spelling of the vowels remains the same despite an alternation or 
change in the sound represented by the spelling. These alternations occur as suffixes are added 
and the accented syllables change (e.g., im POSE / IM po SI tion). Students benefit most from the 
study of vowel alternation patterns when these patterns are presented in a logical sequence. Begin 
by studying related words containing simple vowel alternations that change from long to short 
vowel sounds as suffixes are added, as in nature to natural, sane to sanity and divine to divinity.
Next, have students explore in depth the spelling of the schwa, or least accented vowel 
sound, known as reduced vowels. As affixes are added to words, the accented syllables 
change—con FIDE to CON fi dent—and the reduction in accent influences the sound of the 
vowel. The long-i is reduced to schwa in reside to resident, oppose to opposition and invite to 
invitation. In many words, the vowel is reduced from the short sound to the schwa: allege to 
allegation, excel to excellent, habitual to habit.
Help students notice that often multiple alternations occur in a group of related words. 
This insight might lead to an investigation of how many vowel and consonant alternations 
they can find within a group of words, such as the following:
ferocious	
ferocity
diplomatic	
diplomacy
specific	
specificity
In ferocious and ferocity, for example, there is a long-to-short-o vowel alternation and a /sh/-/s/ 
consonant alternation.
The spelling–meaning connection explored through consonant and vowel alternations 
plays an important role in fine-tuning spelling knowledge and expanding students’ vocabular-
ies. Once students understand how the principle operates in known words, show them how it 
applies in unknown words. For example, let’s say a student understands but misspells the word 
solemn as SOLEM in his writing. Show him the related word solemnity. In so doing, you can 
address two important objectives. First, the reason for the so-called silent-n in solemn becomes 
clear—the word is related to solemnity, in which the n is pronounced. Second, because he 
already knows the meaning of solemn, he can understand the meaning of the new but related 
word solemnity. You have just used the spelling system to expand this student’s vocabulary.
Greek and Latin Elements
For purposes of vocabulary development, as we saw in Chapter 7, we begin to explore Greek 
and Latin elements at the syllables and affixes stage. In the derivational relations stage, the 
advanced study of Greek and Latin word roots, along with spelling challenges, offers an 
incredibly rich terrain to explore, extending through middle school, high school and beyond. 
Importantly, most significant vocabulary terms within specific academic domains com-
prise these Greek and Latin elements. If you are studying forms of government, words like 
­democracy, monarchy and plutocracy suggest examining the common roots.

It is important to note that, over the years, educators and linguists have used different 
terms to refer to these elements and to make distinctions between roots of Greek or Latin 
origin (Dale, O’Rourke & Bamman, 1971; Henry, 2003; Moats, 2000; Templeton & Gehs-
mann, 2014). For example, roots of Greek origin are often labelled “combining forms”, and 
those of Latin origin are simply “roots”. This is to distinguish the flexibility of Greek elements 
from Latin elements. Greek roots such as photo and graph may combine in different places in 
words—at the beginning, middle or end (telephoto, graphic, photograph). Latin roots, on the 
other hand, tend to stay in one place, with prefixes and suffixes attached (credible, credence, 
incredible). After students understand these word parts and how they work, it may be helpful—
as well as interesting—to point out this distinction between Greek and Latin roots. You may 
also encounter the term stem, which usually refers to a base or word root together with any 
derivational affixes that have been added, and to which inflectional endings may be added. (Yes, 
that’s a mouthful, and that’s why we usually avoid the term in our instruction!) Here are some 
examples: function is a stem to which -s, -ed or -ing may be added; dysfunction is also a stem to 
which these same inflectional endings may be added. As with so much of word study, we need 
to know the various terms and usages but must use them judiciously and consistently with our 
students so as not to overwhelm them with labels when they are first learning a concept.
In the following lesson, Mr. Ramirez shows his students how Latin word roots function 
within words. He begins by passing out a sheet of words and asks students for ideas about how 
to sort them. The students quickly discover that the words contain similar word parts—struct 
and fract. Mr. Ramirez writes the key words fracture and construct and then writes the rest into 
categories as students call them out.
Mr. Ramirez points out fracture and fraction on the board. “We know what these two words are and what they mean. 
What happens when you fracture your arm?”
Students respond, “You break it.”
“What do you do when you divide something into fractions?” Mr. Ramirez elicits from the students that you 
break whole numbers down into fractions.
“Good! Now, both words fracture and fraction have fract in them. Is fract a word?”
Students respond, “No.”
“It’s a very important part of the words fracture and fraction, however. We call fract a word root. Fract comes 
from a word in Latin that means ‘to break.’ Remember our discussion about the history of English and how so many 
words and word parts in English come from the Greek and Latin languages? Fract lives on in the words fracture and 
fraction. Word roots are everywhere! Let’s look at these words.”
Mr. Ramirez points to the words under construct: construction, structure. “What’s the same in these three words?”
Students point out struct.
“Good! You’ve found the word root! Now, let’s think about what this word root might mean. Think about what 
happens when construction workers construct a building or structure.” Students engage in a brief discussion in 
which the meaning “to build” emerges. “Right! Construct means ‘to build something,’ and structure is another term 
we often use to refer to a building or something that has been built.”
Next, Mr. Ramirez points to the word instruct and asks the students how the meaning of “build” might apply to the 
word. Through discussion, students come to the realisation that instruct refers to how learning or knowledge is “built”.
Mr. Ramirez assigns his students the task of finding more words with the fract and struct roots over the next 
few days. Students brainstorm, use the class dictionary and consult an online dictionary to develop a long list of 
words including fractious, fractals, infraction, refraction, superstructure, reconstruction, unstructured, destruction, 
indestructible, obstruction and instructional. Students record the words they find in the word study section of their 
vocabulary notebooks and come together to compare their findings. ●

and engaging history and is 
what Mr. Ramirez refers to in 
the lesson below.

CH AP TER 8 
Word roots nestle within longer words and are the meaningful anchor to which prefixes 
and suffixes may attach. Roots also follow the basic spelling–meaning premise that words with 
similar meanings are usually spelled similarly. It is important to point out to students that 
spelling visually represents the meanings of these elements and preserves the meaning rela-
tionships among words that at first may appear quite different. The consistent spelling of word 
roots is students’ best clue to identifying them and examining how they function within words 
(inspect, spectator, predict, indict). Occasionally, the spelling of the roots may vary—both vid (in 
video and evident) and vis (in visible and television) come from the Latin word videre, meaning 
“to see”. Students may already have noted some of these variations. For example, ask them to 
think about how receive and reception are related in meaning. Students can now examine these 
words while attending to the meaning of the root within the related words (ceiv and cep both 
mean “take”). It also helps that these changes are usually predictable (see the next section).
At the derivational relations stage, exploring Greek and Latin elements begins with those 
that occur with greatest frequency in the language and are most transparent in the words in 
which they occur. They should be sequenced according to the abstractness of their meanings, 
from concrete to abstract (Templeton, 2004, 2012). For example, the Greek roots therm (heat) 
and photo (light) and the Latin roots spect (to look), rupt (to break, burst) and dict (to speak, 
say) are introduced and explored early in the sequence because their meaning is transparent or 
straightforward. The way in which other roots function within words is often not as transpar-
ent, so those roots are explored later—for example, the Latin roots fer (to carry) in defer and 
spir (to breathe) in inspiration are somewhat abstract or metaphorical. Table 8.2 lists appropri-
ate Greek and Latin roots; more Greek and Latin roots are in Appendix E.
Predictable Spelling Changes in Vowels and Consonants
After students have systematically explored some word roots and their derivational relatives 
that share the same spelling, they can begin examining related words in which both the sound 
and spelling change. This change is predictable or occurs regularly in families. For example, the 
spelling change of the long-a in explain from ai to a reduced-a in the derived word explanation is  
not the only word pair in which this type of change occurs; it also occurs in exclaim/exclama-
tion and proclaim/proclamation; a similar change from long to short-e occurs in receive/reception 
and deceive/deception. Students learn that, if the base word has the ai or ei spelling, the derived 
word’s spelling is simply a or e. Students can examine these words after they understand the 
spelling–meaning patterns presented earlier. As noted in the previous section, they also are 
learning that these spelling changes occur within word roots.
Students first conduct a word sort in which each base word is paired with its derivative, 
and then sort the word pairs according to the specific spelling change that occurs. The fol-
lowing sort illustrates this feature:
receive/reception	
exclaim/exclamation	
detain/detention
conceive/conception	
proclaim/proclamation	
retain/retention
deceive/deception	
reclaim/reclamation
perceive/perception	
acclaim/acclamation
Advanced Suffix Study
A handful of suffixes present occasional challenges even for advanced readers and writers. The 
adjective-forming suffix -able/-ible seems to be a classic for misspelling. However, there is a 
generalisation that usually helps determine whether this suffix is spelled -able or -ible. Consider 
the sort below and look for the root or base word from which each word is derived.
dependable	
credible
profitable	
audible
agreeable	
edible

Word Study for Advanced Readers and Writers	
315
If the suffix is attached to a base word or free morpheme (depend), it is usually spelled -able; if 
it is attached to a word root or bound morpheme (cred), it is usually spelled -ible. Base words 
that end in e usually drop the e and add -able (desire/desirable); however, soft c or g endings may 
be followed by -ible, as in reducible, and sometimes a final e is retained to keep the soft sound, 
as in noticeable and manageable. These investigations generate discussions of how taking words 
apart or morphological analysis leads to roots and the words they generate. For example, the 
root ten in pretend, contend, tennis, tense, tent and tendon; the Latin root facere (for do or make) in 
words with the root forms fac-, -fic-, fact and -fect-, as seen in words like artefact, defect, factory 
and manufacture.
Students can understand the connection between the suffixes -ant/-ance and -ent/-ence 
when pairs are examined: brilliant/brilliance, confident/confidence. Sound is no clue, but if you 
know the spelling of a word that ends in one of these suffixes, that word is a clue to the spell-
ing of the suffix in the related word (Templeton, 1980). At this level, most students know how 
to spell one of the words in such pairs correctly; making this spelling–meaning relationship 
explicit is extremely helpful.
Whether consonants are doubled when inflectional endings are added, in words like com-
mitted and benefited, is revisited in the derivational relations stage with words of more than one 
syllable. Mr. Ramirez provides a collection of words that double and words that do not, and 
challenges his students to figure out why. See Table 7.2 for a summary of the rules.
“Okay, we’ve got a few words here to sort. What do you notice about these words? That’s right, they all end in -ed. 
What do you notice about the base words?” He and his students discuss the fact that in some cases the final con-
sonant has been doubled before adding -ed, and in others it has stayed the same. He has them sort the words into 
two columns by those features:
excelled	
edited
occurred	
limited
submitted	
orbited
referred	
conquered
Mr. Ramirez asks the students to work in pairs to talk about what they see and hear when they contrast the 
words in both columns. He encourages them to read the base words in each column several times. If no one brings 
up “accent” as a possible explanation, he asks them to listen as he reads the base words in each column, emphasis-
ing the accented syllable: excel, occur, submit, refer. Then he reads edit, limit, orbit, conquer.
“I get it, I get it!” yells Silvio. “The accent is on a different syllable! When it is on the last syllable you have to 
double!”
Silvio has uncovered the generalisation that Mr. Ramirez is working towards: if the last syllable of the base 
word is accented, double the final consonant before adding -ed (and -ing as well). If the last syllable is not accented, 
then do not double the final consonant.
Mr. Ramirez follows up the sort with a bit of history:
“Remember when Elsa brought in the British copy of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire that her grandma bought 
for her in England and we noticed how the spelling of some of the words was different than in American English? For 
example, there were a lot of doubled consonants that we don’t have—benefited had two ts. Actually, in just about 
every situation where we in the United States do not double the final consonant, people in other English-speaking 
countries do. Do you know who we can blame for making it so that Americans have to think about whether or not to 
double? Would you believe it was Noah Webster? Yes! The man who brought us our first dictionary!
“Actually, what Webster wanted to do was make English spoken and written in the United States  
different from English spoken and written in Britain. When he did this, our country wasn’t getting along too well 

	 316	
CH AP TER 8 
When students notice exceptions to this principle—when they see the spelling travelled or 
benefitted, for example—ask them to check the dictionary. Though they will see the correct spell-
ing they will also see the alternative spelling, perhaps with the label Brit because final consonants 
like l are more likely to be doubled in British English whether they are accented or not. (By the 
way, Mr. Ramirez was able to work the information about Noah Webster into his lesson because 
he had recently read Kendall’s The Forgotten Founding Father, to which we referred earlier.)
Assimilated Prefixes
Students study prefixes first in the within word pattern stage, and explore them more system-
atically at the syllables and affixes stage. Some prefixes are obvious visual and meaning units 
that are easy to see and understand, as in unlikely or inactive. Students at the derivational rela-
tions stage examine a group of prefixes that is somewhat disguised, as in the word illegal. The 
only clue to the prefix is the doubled letters. Known as assimilated or absorbed prefixes, their 
spellings may pose a significant challenge for students because they depend on considerable 
prior knowledge about other basic spelling–meaning patterns, processes of adding prefixes to 
base words, and simple Greek and Latin roots. Most adults are unaware of how assimilated 
prefixes work, but such knowledge can resolve many spelling dilemmas—such as how to spell 
accommodate, one of the most frequently misspelled words in the English language.
The following sort explores the idea of absorbed prefixes. Present the words in a random 
list and ask students to discuss their meanings. Students are likely to conclude that they all 
seem to mean “not” or “the opposite of ”. When asked how they might sort the words, the 
following categories emerge:
ineffective	
illiterate	
immature	
irregular	
impossible
inorganic	
illegal	
immobile	
irrational	
impatient
inactive	
illogical	
immortal	
irrelevant	
improper
infinite	
illegible	
immodest
Ask students what they notice about the base words in each column. You might suggest they 
try saying “inmobile” or “inrelevant”. Though it’s possible to pronounce them, it’s definitely 
awkward—moving from the n to m in inmobile and the n to r in inrelevant is cumbersome. At 
this point, some students will realise that the particular spelling of the prefix in- often depends 
on the first letter of the base word, taking on the same spelling (i.e., being “absorbed”). In fact, 
if they go to the dictionary to look up the prefixes or the words, they will be referred back to 
the original prefix in-.
Mr. Ramirez describes the process for his students, beginning by posing the question, “If 
all these prefixes mean the same thing, why do we spell them in different ways?” The students 
notice that the spelling seems to be related to the base word; il- is used before words starting 
with l and ir- before words starting with r. “Good observations”, he responds. “Let’s take the 
word immobile. A long time ago, the prefix in- was combined with the word mobile to create 
a new word that meant ‘not mobile’. Now, try pronouncing the word like it was pronounced 
when it first came into existence: inmobile. Does that feel kind of weird? Does your tongue 
kind of get stuck on the beginning of mobile? Mine sure does! Over time it became easier for 
people to leave out the /n/ sound when pronouncing the word. The sound of the n became 
‘absorbed’ into the /m/ sound at the beginning of the base word mobile. Before long, the spell-
ing of the n changed to indicate this change in pronunciation—but it’s important to remember 
with Britain—after all, we had fought a war to become independent not long before! So in his dictionary of Ameri-
can English—the first of its kind—Webster decided to change many spellings. One of the most obvious ways was 
to take out the u in words such as honour and behaviour.” Mr. Ramirez writes these words on the board. “He also 
switched the re in words such as theatre and centre.” He writes these on the board. ●

that this letter didn’t disappear. They knew it was necessary to keep the two letters in the 
prefix to indicate that it was still a prefix. If the last letter of the prefix had been dropped, then 
the meaning of the prefix might have been lost.”
Primarily Latin in origin, assimilated or absorbed prefixes are widespread in English; an 
extensive list of assimilated prefixes is in Appendix E. By the way, accommodate has two assimi-
lated prefixes: the d in the prefix ad- is absorbed into the first letter sound of the second prefix 
con-, and the n in con- is absorbed into the first letter sound of the word root -mod- (literally, 
“to fit with”).
Spelling Strategies
Students in the derivational relations stage can use a range of strategies to spell unfamiliar 
words. The sixth-grader whose writing appears in Figure 8.1 is certainly thinking about spell-
ing in the final sentence—evidence of a spelling conscience. The proofreading tips described 
in Chapter 3 and strategies described in Chapter 7, such as using spell check, apply in this 
stage as well.
Word Study Instruction for the Derivational 
Relations Stage
The principles for instructing intermediate readers and writers also guide our instruction at 
the advanced level. As at the intermediate level, word study for advanced readers emphasises 
actively exploring words and applying word knowledge to spelling, vocabulary develop-
ment and analysing unknown words encountered in reading. We can initiate word study for 
advanced readers by observing, “You know, when you first learned to read you had to learn 
how spelling stands for sounds. Now you’re going to learn how spelling stands for meaning.”
Sequence and Pacing
Table 8.2 presents a general sequence for word study in the derivational relations stage. Just as 
at the syllables and affixes stage, deciding what features to teach is often restricted by the dif-
ficulty of the word meanings rather than any problems with reading or spelling the words. For 
example, assimilated prefixes are examined later because many of the words that contain them 
will not occur with much frequency in the reading materials or be in the speaking vocabularies 
of most upper elementary students (e.g., immunity or innumerable). Although you can include 
some new vocabulary words in every sort at this level, there should still be a good number 
of familiar words from which students can begin to make generalisations, moving from the 
known to the unknown.
An important caution: You may wish to confirm that students who seem to be at the 
derivational stage based on the Elementary Spelling Inventory (ESI) are indeed at that level. 
Administering the Upper-Level Spelling Inventory (USI) more accurately identifies what 
features students need to study in the late syllables and affixes and early derivational relations 
stages. While we suggest a sequence of study, you will probably find that most students can be 
instructed on a number of features at the same time, which allows some flexibility in terms of 
grouping and selecting topics of study.
Early/Middle.  Students in the early stage of derivational relations have mastered most 
syllable juncture conventions, including spellings of most prefixes and suffixes and what hap-
pens when they are affixed to bases; they are working through the juncture conventions that 
govern the spelling of the frequent suffix -ion (-tion, -sion, -ssion). Occasionally, a common pre-
fix may be misspelled, such as permission spelled PURMISSION by analogy with words such 
as purchase, or destroy spelled DISTROY because of the pronunciation of the first syllable and 

	 318	
CH AP TER 8 
the frequency of the prefix dis-. Students in the early phase are also still learning how meaning 
is a clue to spelling unstressed vowels, such as not realising that IMPASITION (imposition) is 
explained by the related word impose. By the middle phase, the spellings of prefixes and most 
suffixes are fairly locked in, as are the spellings of most bases and roots across morphologically 
related words (compete/competitive/competition).
Late.  A few students in the upper elementary grades may be in the late derivational rela-
tions stage, but most will not reach this stage until at least middle school and high school. 
Students at this phase can spell most new academic vocabulary words correctly when first 
encountering them. They use but confuse assimilated prefixes, however, as well as the suffixes 
-able/-ible, -ant/-ent and -ance/-ence. As we have noted, this phase is not an “end” to develop-
ment but rather part of a never-ending, fascinating journey.
Assess and Monitor Progress in the 
Derivational Relations Stage
Students in the derivational relations stage generally are good spellers because they have 
already acquired a great deal of word knowledge. As we emphasise in this chapter, word study 
for these students focuses primarily on the generative aspects of morphology and how the 
structure of words is usually the key to their meanings. You should address more than spell-
ing in assessments. When you do assess with a focus on spelling, you needn’t call out all the 
words in a sort, but rather only 10 or 15. Every few weeks, administer a cumulative review 
consisting of selected words representing different elements and patterns. There are several 
ways to assess.
• Ask students to spell the words studied that week. This works well for endings such as -ion, 
-ible/-able and -ence/-ance, in which sound is not a clue.
• Ask students to both spell and define words; definitions should be in their own words.
• Give students a base word and ask them to add suffixes, such as adding -ion to words like 
separate (separation), invade (invasion) and commit (commission). Use words that they have not 
sorted to test for understanding of generalisations.
• Ask students to generate words given a prefix, suffix or root. For example, the root tract 
should yield words like attract, traction and perhaps tractor.
• Ask students to generate a related word in which a consonant or vowel sound is heard. 
For example, “There is a silent letter in moisten. Write a related word in which you can 
hear the sound of the letter.” (moist)
• Ask students to match elements to meaning, such as matching hyper- and hypo- to the 
meanings “over” and “under.”
• Ask students to spell a word and then underline a prefix, suffix or root and also define the 
element, such as fracture means “break.”
• Provide a sentence and ask students to supply or select the target word, as in the follow-
ing: He loved to learn magic tricks and wanted to become a _______________.
As in the syllables and affixes stage, students at this stage can monitor their own progress. 
However, there is less urgency in this stage because word study for derivational relations is 
typically spread out over the middle school and high school years and beyond—literally for 
the rest of their lives. Think about the word sorts you do with students at this level as sup-
porting their vocabulary knowledge, both word-specific and generative. Unlike earlier devel-
opmental stages, sorts at this level need not be one-week affairs. Rather, they often stretch 
across two and sometimes three weeks.
As at all stages, review and grade student vocabulary notebooks. Focus on the range of 
words collected during word hunts for particular patterns, the types of open sorts that are 
recorded, and how well new words have been collected and described. (See Templeton et al.,

self-assessments.)
Word Study with English Learners in the 
Derivational Relations Stage
English learners have the potential to be more sensitive to words than monolingual speakers 
simply because they must be more analytical—of their home language as well as English— in 
order to negotiate the nature of spelling–sound–meaning relationships (Templeton, 2010). 
The study of cognates is fruitful at the derivational relations stage and can also benefit native 
English speakers who might be learning Spanish, French or German as a foreign language. 
Cognates are words in different languages that share similar structures and similar meanings 
because they share similar origins.
We know that a large number of words in English are derived from Latin; this is true 
for many other languages as well. You can see the spelling–meaning connection in mater 
(Latin), madre (Spanish), mere (French), mutter (German) and mother (English). Paying 
attention to cognates helps both English learners and native speakers of English see mor-
phological similarities between their native language and their to-be-learned language. Just 
as with our word sorts in English, sorting English and Spanish cognates offers opportuni-
ties for examining spelling–meaning relationships and grammatical features. For example, 
students may notice the common suffixes and their spellings that key different parts of 
speech (Nash, 1997):
Nouns
Adjectives
Verbs
Adverbs
English
alphabet
alphabetic
alphabetise
alphabetically
Spanish
alfabeto
alfabético
alfabetisar
alfabéticamente
English
favour
favourable
favour
favourably
Spanish
favour
favourable
favourecer
favourablemente
Opportunities for finding cognates abound in specific academic domains such as science 
(Bravo, Hiebert & Pearson, 2005), math and social studies (Templeton, 2010; Templeton  
et al., 2015). In science or math, for example, students may match and discuss what they notice 
about the following cognates:
English	
polygon	
quadrilateral	
hexagon	
pentagon	
triangle
Spanish	
polígono	
cuadrilatero	
hexágono	
pentágono	
triángulo
Word roots also offer a rich terrain for exploring cognates in other languages. Make it a 
point to look for cognates as you study the different Latin roots—port shows up in Spanish 
importar and exportar and means the same thing (“carry”) as in export and import. Create a chart 
of cognates in your classroom that students can add to as they discover more words. While 
most cognates across languages have the same or similar meanings, it is also important to be 
aware of potential “false friends”. For example, the Spanish word suburbio looks a lot like the 
English word suburbia, or suburbs, but the Spanish word suburbio refers to the slums (Swan & 
Smith, 2001). Likewise, the Spanish word éxito doesn’t correlate with exit at all, but means 
“success”. The following resource supports exploring words and patterns at the derivational 
relations level in Spanish, and supports extensive cognate study with English:

Word Study Routines and Management
Keep three basic points in mind regarding students’ word study at this level (Templeton, 1989, 
1992, 2012):
1.	 Words and word elements selected for study should be generative, which means that, 
when possible, teach about words in “meaning families”. This highlights the awareness 
that particular patterns of relationships can be extended or generalised to other words. 
For example, being aware of the long-to-short vowel alternation pattern in words such as 
compete and competition can generalise to words such as reduce/reduction.
2.	 The words that we initially select for students to explore should be based on how obvious 
the relationship is. For example, teach clearly related words, such as represent/misrepresent, 
before teaching words that are less clearly related, such as expose/exposition.
3.	 There should be a balance of teacher-directed instruction with students’ exploration and 
discussion. See ideas about how to foster thoughtful active discussions in Chapter 3.
Teacher-Directed Word Study Instruction
Word study should take place all day long and in all content areas as you pause to examine 
words, talk about unusual spellings (e.g., pneumonia), search for clues to meaning in the word 
and in context, and look up and discuss words in the dictionary. But, as in other stages, students 
in the derivational relations stage still need in-depth systematic attention to features at their 
developmental level. We emphasise the importance of word study at this developmental level 
for middle and secondary students, especially if these students have not experienced this type 
of systematic word study in school prior to this time.
Routines
Consider the routines and word study notebook activities appropriate for earlier stages. Cat-
egorising words through sorting is still a powerful learning activity; however, some teachers 
rely more on writing words into categories than on cutting out words and sorting them physi-
cally. Blind sorts still work well when spelling is an issue (as in -able and -ible sorts or when 
working with the /shən/ ending), but do not pose much of a challenge when the sort features 
prefixes and roots.
Word hunts should extend over longer periods of time. In addition to words and features 
pulled from literary and informational texts, brainstorming additional words (word hunts in 
the head) sometimes works well and dictionaries can become a place for word hunts. Students 
can be taught to search online dictionaries by using an asterisk before and/or after the word 
part to get a list of words (e.g., *cian will give you words that end with -cian; *hydr* will yield 
the hundreds of words that contain this root).
Ongoing classroom displays of words provide continual review 
as words turn up in reading and in class discussions; these can 
be added to categories started weeks before. As students explore 
word histories, show them how to reference and read the entries in 
unabridged dictionaries and in the resources available for such explo-
ration (see Resource Connections: Teacher Resources for Word-
Specific Vocabulary Activities, page 308).
Routines that focus on the meanings of words are very impor-
tant. For example, have students use the dictionary to look up and 
record definitions and word origins of selected words (but not 20 at 
a time!). Have students use words in sentences to demonstrate their 
understanding of meaning, but invite them also to try illustrations or 
cartoons. These visual representations can be powerful mnemonics, 
as shown in Figure 8.5. Having students work cooperatively and let-
ting them share their sentences or drawings is engaging.

Games are a valuable way to review words not only for a test, but also over time. At this 
level students can create many games themselves based on popular games like Concentration, 
Rummy, War, Slap Jack, Uno, Trivial Pursuit and Jeopardy. Give them blank game board 
­templates from Appendix F or card stock for playing cards and they can do the rest. While 
creating games, they will remember the words and come to understand the feature better.
At this stage, exploring a particular group of words and the spelling–meaning patterns 
they represent offers a number of paths to explore. For this reason, some teachers adopt a two-
week schedule that includes a word study contract such as the one in Chapter 3. Give students 
20 to 40 words, and have them complete a selection of routines independently in school or for 
homework. Test students every two weeks and include an assessment of mastery of meaning as 
well as of spelling. Ask students to explain the meaning of a prefix, root or particular words.
Word Study Notebooks
Word study notebooks are an integral part of students’ word learning at this stage (Gill & Bear, 
1989; Templeton et al., 2015). In this last stage of development, the word study notebooks may 
be called Vocabulary Notebooks. Students use the notebooks to record word sorts and add 
words to the sorts after going on word hunts. To begin, divide the notebooks into three sections:
1.	 Word Study.  A weekly record of sorts, reflections and homework, this is also the section 
to record words that consistently present spelling challenges. Thinking of related words 
is one way to help clarify spellings.
2.	 Looking into Language.  Includes records of whole-group word study of related words, 
concept sorts, interesting word collections, investigations and theme study words.
3.	 New and Interesting Words.  Words that students encounter in their reading that really 
grab them (much as “golden lines” do in their reading) are golden words (Templeton et al., 
2015). These are often new and perhaps difficult words. Teach the following steps to help 
older students collect golden words:
• Collect the word.  While reading, mark words that really grab you or that you find dif-
ficult. When you are through reading or studying, go back to these words. Read around 
each word, and think about its possible meaning.
• Record the word and sentence.  Write the word, followed by the sentence in which it was used, 
the page number and an abbreviation for the title of the book. (At times the sentence will 
be too long; write enough of it to give a clue to meaning.) Think about the word’s meaning.
• Look at word parts and think about their meanings.  Look at the different parts of the 
word—prefixes, suffixes and base word or root word. Think about the meanings of the 
affixes and the base or root.
• Record-related words.  Think of other words that are like this word, and write them 
underneath the part of the word that is similar.
• Use the dictionary.  Look the word up in the dictionary, read the various definitions, 
and record the one that applies to the word in the book you are reading. Look for 
similar words (both in form and meaning) above and below the target word and list 
them as well. Look at the origin of the word, and add it to your entry if it is interesting.
• Review the words. 
A realistic goal is to collect five to ten words a week. Students can share the word in class, as 
in the following example:
• Collect the word: orthography.
• Record the word and sentence: “English orthography is not crazy, and it carries the history 
of the word with it.” p. 22, Sounds of Language.
• Look at word parts and think about their meanings: ortho/graph (may have something to 
do with writing).
• Record possible related words: orthodontist, orthodox, graphics, orthographer.
• Study the word in the dictionary, and record interesting information: “A method of rep-
resenting the sounds of a language by letters; spelling.” Origin: ortho—“correct;” graph—
“something written.”

	 322	
CH AP TER 8 
When looking for meaning connections, related words include orthodontist, orthopaedist, orthodox; 
graph, graphics. When you work with students to make the meaning connection for ortho-, say, 
“What does an orthodontist do? An orthodontist makes your teeth straight. And an orthopae-
dist? An orthopaedist makes your bones straight. And if you are orthodox, you live a ‘straight’ 
or correct life. And indeed when we look in the dictionary, ortho- means straight or correct.”
Vocabulary Their Way® (2nd edition) by Templeton, Bear, Invernizzi, Johnston, Flanigan, 
Townsend, Helman and Hayes (2015) provides background and a wealth of instructional 
­support for students at this level, including engaging ways of developing and fully using word 
study/vocabulary notebooks. You should find this resource especially helpful for derivational 
level students at the intermediate grades, extending the types of activities and instruction pre-
sented in this chapter. In addition, you may find that it extends your own knowledge base as 
well and provides you with the confidence to explore words more deeply with your students.
Preparing Sorts in the Derivational Relations Stage
There are a number of word sorts in Appendix D and on the PDToolkit that are appropriate for 
more advanced derivational relations students. Additional words are in the lists in appendixes 
D and E, which suggest other sorts as well. These resources present avenues of word study that 
are engaging and rewarding for students who are verbally advanced. Students should already 
be able to spell and define at least half of the words. With more advanced students, a larger 
proportion of the words included in sorts may be unfamiliar, but the students usually are able to 
infer the meanings because these words share similar meaning elements with the known words.
When you consistently model this type of exploration and curiosity about words—word 
consciousness—it becomes part of students’ learning repertories. Indeed, it is more a mindset than 
a strategy per se. Students who develop word consciousness become lifelong wordsmiths and 
almost automatically wonder about the relationships among words in general, and about a par-
ticular word specifically; for example, does the similarity in spelling between applaud/plaudit and 
mordant/morsel capture underlying meaning relationships? (Yes!) When you share this type of 
awareness and curiosity, you nourish the continual growth of vocabulary and conceptual networks.

activities | Derivational Relations Stage
Vocabulary activities presented in Chapter 7 work equally well at the derivational relations 
stage—for example, concept maps and concept sorts. Such activities are excellent for develop-
ing students’ understanding of specific words. The activities we present here not only support 
word-specific learning, but further students’ understanding of the generative characteristics of 
morphology. This understanding drives vocabulary development and more advanced features 
of English spelling. For each activity, applicable Common Core State Standards for Language 
(L) are listed for grades 6, 7 and 8.
	 8.1 	 You Teach the Word
The vocabulary demands of content domains 
are significant. One way to handle these is to 
assign one word to each student, who then 
becomes responsible for teaching that word to 
the rest of the class. Ask each student to create 
a small poster to add to a class word wall, such 
as the one in Figure 8.6, that includes a defini-
tion, a synonym and/or antonym, an etymol-
ogy, a sentence or an illustration. Students 
can share their posters, but also encourage 
them to think of creative ways to help each 
other learn the word, such as by acting it out. 
For more advanced students, see the “Word 
Museum” project in Templeton et al. (2015). 
(CCSS Language (5th–8th) 4.b, 4.c, 4.d)
	 8.2 	 Break it Down
Conduct this as a group activity or as a game (Flanigan et al., 2011). Beginning with words 
the students have already studied, provide sentences containing each word. Using the ques-
tions provided in the template in Figure 8.7, each group analyses—breaks down—a word and 
then justifies how their derived meaning fits in the context of the sentence. Later, after stu-
dents have applied these questions with known words, extend to unfamiliar words. This way 
of thinking about words deepens the strategy for analysing unfamiliar words they encounter 
when they are reading independently (Chapter 7). (CCSS [5th-8th] L: 4.b 4.c 4.d)
	 8.3 	 Words That Grow from Base Words and Word Roots
In this whole-class or small-group activity, students see directly how words “grow”. It builds 
on and extends the understanding, begun during the syllables and affixes stage, of how word 
elements combine. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b)
Materials  You will need a drawing of a tree (see Figure 8.8).
Procedures
1.	Decide on a base word or a word root to highlight. Begin with more frequently occurring 
words; over time, move to less frequently occurring roots.
2.	Write the base word or word root at the bottom of the tree, and think of as many forms 
as possible.
3.	Write the different forms on individual branches.
4.	Display the word tree in the classroom for several days and encourage students to think 
of, find and record more derived words. At the end of the week wipe them off and begin 
again by introducing a new base or word root.

Procedures  The game consists of two rounds: Jeop-
ardy and Double Jeopardy.
1.	The game is modelled after the Jeopardy television 
game. The clue is in the form of an answer and players 
must phrase their response in the form of a question:
Answer clue: Coming from the Latin root tract, it 
means “a machine for pulling heavy loads.”
Question response: What is tractor?
2.	Determine who goes first. The player selects a category and point value. The host uncov-
ers the clue and reads it aloud.
3.	The first player responding correctly adds the point amount of the question to his or 
her total or gets to keep the card that was turned over. He or she then chooses another 
category and point amount. An incorrect answer means that the points are subtracted.
4.	The winner is the one with the most points.
Variations
1.	Add rounds of Double Jeopardy and Final Jeopardy. When it is time for the Final Jeop-
ardy question, players see the category, but not the answer. They then decide how many 
of their points they will risk. When they see the answer, they have 30 seconds to write the 
question. If they are correct, they add the number of points they risked to their total; if 
incorrect, that number of points is subtracted from their total.
2.	Alternate from one player to the next, or from one team to the next, rather than who 
shouts out the response first. If one player misses, the other team gets a chance to respond. 
If they are correct, they also get another turn.
3.	Include Daily Doubles. (The number of points for an answer is doubled and, if correct, 
added to the player’s score; if incorrect, the doubled number of points is subtracted from 
the player’s score.)
4.	Develop a Vocabulary Jeopardy to accompany a study unit. Generate vocabulary cards 
from the unit that fit into four or five categories (e.g., “Food Groups” or “Habitats”). 
Write questions that relate to facts and concepts studied on cards. Teams of students play 
the game as a whole-class vocabulary review of the unit.

	 8.5 	 Word Part Shuffle
Word Part Shuffle is a noncompetitive word-building activity (Moloney, 2008). A group of 
students receives a stack of cards consisting of most of the most generative prefixes, suffixes 
and bases/word roots (see Figure 8.11). The group first creates words that may be found in a 
standard dictionary. Then the group coins a new word, using as many of the cards as they can. 
They create a definition for the new word and then share with other groups. Kara Moloney 
created a deck of these cards with colour-coded margins indicating prefix, suffix or base/root, 
which is available at on the verbum-struct-ion website. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b)
	 8.6 	 Quartet
Many games can be played with a deck of word cards made into suits of four. This game is much 
like “Go Fish”, except the object is to collect and lay down a suit of four cards (or a quartet).
Materials  Create 10 to 12 suits of four cards, composed of words that share a common 
root; for example, biology, biography, biome, antibiotic. Write the words at the top left so stu-
dents can read the words when holding cards in their hands. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b)

Procedures 
1.	Each player is dealt seven cards; the rest are put in a 
deck. Each player looks through his or her cards for 
words in the same suit.
2.	The first player turns to the next and asks for a 
particular root: “Give me any cards with the bio 
root.” If the second player has any cards with 
the requested root, the player must give them up 
and the first player gets to go again. If the sec-
ond player does not have any matches, he or she 
responds, “Draw one” and the first player draws 
from the deck.
3.	Play proceeds in a clockwise fashion. When a player 
has a complete suit of four cards, he or she may lay 
them down. The player who has the most suits at 
the end—when someone runs out of cards—is the 
winner.

CH AP TER 8 
activities | Derivational Relations Stage
	 8.7 	 It’s All Greek to Us
In this card game, the deck is composed of words derived from Greek roots. Three to five 
players may participate, one of whom will serve as game master, and hold and read definition 
cards. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b)
Materials  Using the list of Greek roots and derived words in Appendix E, prepare ten 
definition cards that consist of a root and definition, such as derm (“skin”). For each root, cre-
ate four or more word cards (epidermis, dermatology, taxidermist, hypodermic, pachyderm). Write 
these words at the top so they can be seen when held in the hand.
Procedures
1.	The game master shuffles the word cards, deals ten cards per player and places the 
remaining word cards face-down.
2.	The game master reads a definition card and lays it down face-up. All players who are 
holding a card that matches the definition read it and place it below the corresponding 
Greek root. If no player can respond to the definition, the game master places the defini-
tion card on the bottom of his or her cards for rereading later in the game.
3.	To begin the next round, a new definition card is laid down.
4.	The player who discards all ten word cards first is the winner and becomes the next game 
master.
	 8.8 	 Brainburst
In this game, players compete to brainstorm as many words as they can that are derived from 
the same root. Only unique words earn points. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b, 4.c)
Materials  Write different roots on cards—such as graph, phon, scope, aud, dict, port, tract, 
struct, spect—roots that have a wide variety of possible derivations. Each team or player needs 
a pencil and sheet of paper. You will need a timer and a standard dictionary (condensed dic-
tionaries may not have enough words).
Procedures
1.	Select one card and announce the root. Set the timer for two to three minutes. Each player 
or team tries to think of as many words as possible derived from that root.
2.	When the timer goes off, players draw a line under their last words and count the number 
they have.
3.	The player with the longest list reads the list aloud. If another player has the same word, 
it is crossed off of everyone’s list. Any words that are not on another list (unique words) 
are checked.
4.	Each player in turn reads aloud any words that no one else has called to determine if he 
or she has a unique word. Disputes should be settled with the help of a dictionary.
5.	The player or team with the most unique words is the winner of the round.
Variations  This game can also be played with prefixes (ex-, sub-, pre-, post-, etc.) and 
suffixes (-ible, -able, -ant, -ent, etc.).
	 8.9 	 Joined at the Roots
This concept sort is an effective extension of students’ exploration of Latin and Greek word 
roots. It is appropriate for individuals, partners or small groups. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b)
Materials  You will need a word sort board, word cards and vocabulary notebook.
Procedures
1.	Model how to place words with appropriate roots under a particular category; for 
example, “Speaking and Writing”, “Building/Construction”, “Thinking and Feeling” and 
“Movement”. Then involve students in the categorisation.

	
Word Study for Advanced Readers and Writers	
329
activities | Derivational Relations Stage
2.	Once students grasp how this categorisation scheme works, they can work in small groups 
or in pairs. Each group or pair takes a different category and sorts words whose roots 
justify their membership in that category.
3.	Have students write lists in vocabulary notebooks, and bring them to the larger group to 
share and discuss. (Note: Several of the words to be sorted may be placed under different 
categories.) Following are some examples of categories and a few illustrative words:
Speaking  
and Writing
Building/ 
Construction
Thinking  
and Feeling
Government
Movement
Travel
autobiography

	8.10 	 Root Webs
Root webs like the one in Figure 8.12 are a graphic way to represent the links among words 
derived from a common root. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b)
Procedures
1.	Choose a set of common roots, such as photo-, geo-, aqua- and astro-.
2.	Model a web for students, as they complete their own webs in their vocabulary notebooks. 
Once students understand how to create the root webs, they can do them independently 
or in small groups.
3.	Brainstorm related words. Students should use 
dictionaries to locate roots, verify their meanings, 
find their origins and search for related words.
4.	Honour all suggestions. Eliminate words that do 
not fit the meaning of a root. Lead students to 
examine parts and meaning.
Variation  A progressive root web provides the 
context for a more systematic walk-through of how 
words are generated from a common word root. 
­Figure 8.13 is an example of a completed progressive 
web for the root ject, meaning “throw”. Walk-through 
each addition of an affix on one strand of the web, 
writing the derived word and discussing its meaning 
with students. Invite students to complete the other 
strands, discussing the meaning of each derived word 
with the class. This model can then be used with other 
roots by students who work in pairs or small groups.
	8.11 	 Identifying the Meanings of Word Roots
Given a series of words that share the same root, students analyse the words to determine 
the meaning of the root. Each group of three words can be finished with one of the words 
provided. For example, in item 1 of the first grouping, students look for which of the three 
words—introspection, interrupt or distract—­contains the same root as spectator, inspect and 
prospector (introspection). In the next sentence, they write what they believe the root spect 
means. In the third sentence, they decide which of the remaining words—interrupt or  
distract—contains the same root as corrupt, disrupt, eruption and so on. This is an excellent 
activity for students to work on in pairs. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b)

Variations  Following this format, groups of students can construct their own exercises 
and then swap with other groups. Appendix E has additional roots.
	8.12 	 Combining Roots and Affixes
In a matrix such as the one in Figure 8.14, students 
indicate with an X words that can be made by 
combining the prefix and the root. Then they write 
the words below. A variation is to indicate with a 
“?” words that do not exist in English, but could. 
Students may write these words in a special section 
of their vocabulary notebooks, creating a definition 
and using each in a sentence. When students are 
uncertain about whether a word is an actual word in 
English, they may check it in the dictionary. (CCSS 
Language (6th–8th) 4.b, 4.c)
	8.13 	 From Spanish to English—A Dictionary Word Hunt
The purpose of this activity is to expand students’ vocabularies through discovering relations 
among cognates. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b)
Procedures
1.	Look through a Spanish–English dictionary to find words in Spanish that remind you of 
words in English. Briefly note the definition or synonym (see Nash, 1997).
2.	With an English dictionary, find words that share the same root or affix. Write these 
related words in your vocabulary notebook.
3.	Record findings in the vocabulary notebook and create a class chart. 
Following are sample entries on a class chart of cognates that one group of students collected 
in this activity.

	8.14 	 The Synonym/Antonym Continuum
This activity encourages students to think about the subtle differences between word mean-
ings as they work with antonyms and synonyms. (CCSS [6th-8th] L: 4.a, 4.b, 4.c, 4.d)

Materials  Think of opposites like hot/cold, brave/frightened, old/young, lazy/energetic and so on. 
Use a thesaurus to find synonyms for each word in the pair and write them on cards or in a list.
Procedures  Have students arrange the words along a continuum. At the ends of the 
continuum are the antonyms (words that are most opposite in meaning). Next to each of these 
words, students decide where to place synonyms (words that are closest to the meaning of the 
opposite words) and so on until all words are used.
For example, the words balmy, frigid, chilly, boiling, frozen, tepid, hot, cool and warm can be 
arranged this way:
frigid    frozen    chilly    cool    tepid    balmy    warm    hot
Students can first work individually and then compare their continua with one another. 
They should discuss differences and provide rationales for why they arranged particular words 
the way they did. The dictionary is the final judge of any disagreements. Encourage students to 
add other words, like sweltering, steamy, balmy and so on, by brainstorming or using a thesaurus 
or dictionary. Give students a word pair of opposites and send them to a thesaurus to create 
a list of words. They can then order them as above or present them to another team to order.
	8.15 	 Semantic Feature Analysis
This analysis (Anders & Bos, 1986) engages students in examining words and definitions in 
relation to each other. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b, 4.c, 4.d)
Procedures
1.	Write the words to be examined down the left margin of a matrix. (In this example, the 
words are prefix, base word, affix, suffix and word root.) Then write the features of these 
words across the top. When you introduce this activity to students, list these features 
yourself. Later, after students understand how the analysis works, they have them suggest 
the features that will be listed.
2.	Discuss the matrix with the whole class or with small groups. Students mark each cell with 
one of the following symbols: a plus sign (+) indicates a definite relationship between the 
word and a feature; a minus sign (-) shows the word does not have that feature; and a 
question mark (?) says that students feel they need more information before responding.
3.	After students complete the matrix, point out (1) they now really know how much they 
know about each word, and (2) they also know what they still need to find out (Templeton, 
1997).  Figure 8.15 illustrates a semantic feature analysis completed by a group of sixth-
grade students under a teacher’s guidance to clarify the meanings of word study terms.
	8.16 	 Which Suffix?
This activity is an excellent follow-up to previous work with base words, word roots and suf-
fixes. It is appropriate for individuals, buddies or small groups. The suffixes included are -tion/-
sion, -ible/-able, -ence/-ance and -ary/-ery. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.b, 4.c, 4.d)

Materials  You will need a word sort board, word cards and a vocabulary notebook.
Procedures
1.	Decide how many suffix pairs to place at the top of the word sort board. (Note that sev-
eral of the words to be sorted may be placed under different suffixes; for example, permit: 
permissible, permission.) Each card has the base word written on one side and the same word 
with allowable suffixes on the other side.
2.	Mix up the word cards and place the deck with base words face-up. The students in turn 
choose the top card and decide in which suffix category it belongs.
3.	After all the cards are placed, have students record in their vocabulary notebooks what 
they think is the correct spelling of the word.
4.	After recording all the words, students turn over the cards to self-check the correct ­spelling.
Variations  Students can work as buddies to explore a particular suffix “team” (e.g., -tion 
and -sion) to see what generalisation(s) may underlie the use of a suffix.
	8.17 	 Defiance or Patience?
The game Defiance (if using the ant/ance/ancy family), or Patience (if using the ent/ence/ency 
family), is for three to five players. The object of the game is to make as many groups of two, 
three or four cards of the same derivation as possible and to run out of cards first. (CCSS 
Language (6th–8th) 2.b)
Materials  Using words from the lists in Appendix E, create a deck of 52 cards with suits 
of two, three or four words (e.g., attend, attendance and attendant is a set of three, and radiate, 
radiant, radiance and radiancy for a set of four). Write each word across the top of a card, and 
your deck is prepared.
Procedures
1.	Each player is dealt five cards from the deck. The player to the left of the dealer begins 
the game. The player may first lay down any existing groups of two, three or four held in 
his or her hand. This player then may ask any other player for a card of a certain deriva-
tion in his or her own hand: “Matthew, give me all of your resistance.” (This could result 
in gaining resistance, resistant, resistancy or resist.)
2.	If a player does not have cards with the requested feature, he or she responds, “Be Defiant” 
(or “Be Patient”, depending on which game is being played).
3.	At this point, the requesting player must draw another card from the deck. If the card is 
of the same family being he or she is looking for, the player lays down the match and con-
tinues asking other players for cards. If the card is not a match, play passes to the person 
on the left and continues around the circle in the same manner. If the drawn card makes a 
match in the asking player’s hand but was not in the group requested, he or she must hold 
the pair in hand until his or her turn comes up again. Of course, this means there is a risk 
of another player taking the pair before the next turn.
4.	Play ends when one of the students runs out of cards. The player with the most points wins.
5.	Players may play on other people’s card groups, laying related cards down in front of 
themselves, not in front of the player who made the original match.
6.	Scoring is as follows.
Singles played on other people’s matches
1 point
Pairs
2 points
Triples
6 points
Groups of four
10 points
First player to run out of cards
10 points

	 334	
CH AP TER 8 
activities | Derivational Relations Stage
Variations
1.	Play a version called “Defy My Patience” that mixes sets of words from both lists to create 
an ent/ant deck.
2.	“Challenge My Patience or Defy My Challenge.” In this version, during scoring, before 
everyone throws down his or her hand, students should secretly write additional words 
that have not been played for groups they have laid down. Before hands are revealed, 
students share these lists and an additional point is added to the player’s score for each 
related word he or she wrote. Any player who doubts the authenticity of a word claimed 
by an opponent may challenge the word. The challenger loses a point if the word is valid 
or gains a point if it is not. The player, likewise, counts the word if it is valid or loses a 
point if the challenger proves him or her wrong.
3.	Encourage students to develop their own derivational families to add to this game, or 
another feature to substitute for the ant/ent contrast.
	8.18 	 Assimile
This game can be played by two to six players. (CCSS 
­Language (6th–8th) 2.b, 4.b, 4.c, 4.d)
Materials  The game board is modelled after a Monop-
oly board (see Figure 8.16). You will also need dice, game 
playing pieces, a deck of prefixes that can be assimilated (ad-, 
sub-, in-, ex-, com-, ob-), a deck of base words that can take 
assimilated prefixes (e.g., base words such as company [accom-
pany] or mortal [immortal]) and a set of chance cards. The 
chance cards are similar to the base word cards but should 
be written on cards of a different colour. Players will need 
a sheet of paper and pencil or pen to use in spelling words.
Procedures  This game is modelled after Monopoly.
1.  Place base words face-down around the board, one in 
each space. One prefix is chosen as the focus and placed 
face-up in the centre of the board. Chance cards are also 
placed in the middle.
2.  Players roll the dice to see who goes first. The player 
with the highest number rolls again and moves that 
number of spaces on the board.
3.  After landing on a particular space, the player turns up 
a word card and must determine whether this word can 
be assimilated to the prefix in the centre of the board. If 
the card can be made into a word, the player attempts to 
both say the word and correctly spell it. A player who is 
able to correctly spell the word gets to keep the card. If 
the word cannot be assimilated, it is kept on the board 
face-up (this word will not be played again). However, if 
the word can be assimilated but the player misspells the 
word, the card is turned face-down to be played later in 
the game.
4.	A player who is unable to come up with a word (for whatever reason) forfeits a turn, and 
play moves to the next player.
5.	When a player passes “Go” or lands on a card that is face-up, he or she can draw from the 
chance pile. Chance cards provide players a chance to think of their own assimilated prefix 
word using the base word on the card and any assimilated prefix.
6.	The game is over when all cards that can be played are played. The winner is the player 
with the most correctly spelled words.

Variations  A separate set of Community Chest cards using all of the original assimilated 
prefixes can be placed in the middle of the board, from which players can draw after each 
round of turns. This ensures that all prefixes are studied. (Community Chest cards will have 
the prefixes ad-, in-, com-, ob-, sub-, ex-, per- and dis-.) With this method, the word cards that 
cannot be played with one particular prefix are turned face-down until they can be played.
	8.19 	 Rolling Prefixes
Players must be familiar with all types of assimilated prefixes to play this card game. (CCSS 
Language (6th–8th) 2.b, 4.b, 4.c, 4.d)
Materials  Create a deck of 32 word cards of assimilated prefixes (eight sets of four). 
Each group of four should consist of a mixed sort from each of the seven sets of assimilated 
prefixes: ad-, in-, com-, ob-, sub-, ex- and dis-. One set must be a “wild set” (words with the 
aforementioned prefixes).
Procedures
1.	Each player is dealt eight cards—three cards to each player on the first round, two cards 
to each player on the second round and three cards to each player on the third round.
2.	The player on the dealer’s left starts the game by putting a card face-up in the centre of 
the table. It does not matter what the card is; the player must read the word and state the 
prefix.
3.	The next player to the left and the others that follow attempt to play a card of the same 
suit (having the same prefix) as the first one put on the table. Players must read their word 
and state the prefix.
4.	If everybody follows suit, the cards in the centre of the table are picked up after all the 
players have added their cards, and put to the side. No one scores.
5.	The game continues in the same fashion until someone is unable to follow suit. When this 
occurs, the player can look through his or her hand for a “wild card” and play it, changing 
the suit for the following players.
6.	A player may change suit in this manner at any point in the game if he or she so chooses. 
For example, a player may play the word collide (prefix com-), and the next player may 
either play a com- prefix word (such as concoct) or a word with com elsewhere in the word, 
such as accommodate. If the player chooses accommodate, the prefix the following player 
must concentrate on is ad- or a form of ad-.
7.	A player who is unable to follow suit must pick up the centre deck of cards. The player 
who picks up the cards begins the next round. The game continues this way until someone 
runs out of cards.
Variations
• At first, players may not wish to state the original prefix of the words.
• Make multiple decks of assimilated prefixes, allowing for variation.
• Instead of ending the game after one person runs out of cards, the game can continue by 
the winner of the first round receiving one point for each card that the other players hold 
in their hands at the end of the round.
	8.20 	 Eponyms: Places, Things, Actions
Eponyms are words that refer to places, things and actions that are named after an individual 
(from Greek epi- for “after” + noma for “name”). Students’ interest in word origins is often 
sparked by finding out where such words originate. As these words are discovered, they can 
be recorded in the “Looking into Language” section of the vocabulary notebook and/or dis-
played on a bulletin board. (CCSS Language (6th–8th) 4.c, 4.d)
Following is a sampler of common eponyms.

	8.21 	 Words That Grow from Indo-European Roots
The Indo-European (IE) language, spoken almost 8,000 years ago, is the “mother” language 
to over half of the world’s languages (Watkins, 2011). This is one reason why the etymologi-
cal information included for many entries in the American Heritage Dictionary (2012) includes 
not only the Latin or Greek roots from which they came but also their Indo-European root. 
Exploring these roots provides fascinating insights for students at the derivational level. You 
may wish to begin this exploration with the more concrete roots and activities provided in the 
“Origins” two-volume series by Sandra Robinson and her colleagues (1989). Using an Indo-
European root such as dhreu, which meant “to fall”, students come to appreciate how some 
of our English words with that root developed—drop, droop, drip, drizzle—as well as the more 
figurative meanings of drowsy and dreary.
Once students understand how the meanings of more common English words evolved 
from their Indo-European roots, you can extend their exploration to roots that have generated 
both transparent and more opaque meanings, words that occur most often in general academic 
and domain-specific vocabulary (Templeton, in press).
Materials  Have Watkins’ American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots (2011) and 
Shipley’s Origins of English Words (2001) on hand. Different groups of students may be assigned 
different Indo-European roots to examine.
Procedure  Each group selects English words derived from the root that they believe 
are good examples of how the “core” meaning of the Indo-European root functions in those 
words in present-day English. Then they construct a word tree like they did with Latin and 
Greek roots (see Figure 8.8). Figure 8.17 shows a word tree growing from the Indo-European 
root -genə-, which means “to give birth, beget; with derivatives referring to aspects and results 
of procreation and to familial and tribal groups” (Watkins, 2011, p. 27). Much of the activity’s 
value lies in the conversation that surrounds the students’ investigation. For example, first

students wonder how gentle came from a root having to do 
with giving birth or beginning something. Then, when they 
check the etymological information in the American Heritage 
dictionary, they find that gentle comes from a Middle Eng-
lish word gentil, which in turn came from French. It meant 
“courteous”, coming in turn from Latin gentilis, meaning “of 
the same clan”. The students now understand the part of the 
Indo-European meaning of -genə- having to do with “familial 
and tribal groups”. They discuss how you would be courteous 
to others who were in the same clan—the group you began 
your life with. Generative forms add up quickly, including 
gentle, genteel, gently, gentleman, genealogy, gentry, generic, -genus, 
dehydrogenases and hydrogen to name a few. Students should be 
able to see into words with gen and begin to think of meaning 
connections. Students can dig as deeply as they wish, and 10 to 
15 minutes at a time is usually enough time for a whole class 
or small group examination.
Students at this level are aware of how the spelling in 
related words sometimes changes (having examined, for 
example, pairs such as exclaim/exclamation, proclaim/procla-
mation). When they see the many different words that have 
evolved from a single Indo-European root they will notice 
how the spelling of the root has often changed. For example, 
the e in cognate has fallen away, but gn still functions as a 
meaningful root. Students may realise that so many cognates 
in different languages were, in a sense, “born together” (co + 
gen) because they came from the same Indo-European root!

General Directions for Administering  
the Words Their Way Inventories
Students should not study the words before a test. Assure students that they will not be 
graded on this activity, and that they will be helping you plan for their needs. Introduce the 
assessment to students; for example:
I am going to ask you to spell some words. Spell them the best you can. Some of the words 
may be easy to spell; some may be difficult. When you do not know how to spell a word, spell 
it the best you can.
Ask students to number their paper (or prepare a numbered paper for kindergarten or 
early first grade). Call each word aloud and repeat it. Say each word naturally, without empha-
sising phonemes or syllables. Use it in a sentence, if necessary, to be sure students know the 
exact word. Sample sentences are provided along with the words. After administering the 
inventory, use a Feature Guide, Class Composite Form and if desired, a Spelling-by-Stage 
Classroom Organisation Chart to complete your assessment. Error Guide forms for the 
Primary and Elementary Inventories are available at PDToolkit for Words Their Way. The 
online assessment application helps complete the feature guide and create a class composite 
automatically.
Scoring the Inventory Using the Feature Guides
1.	 To score by hand, make a copy of the appropriate Feature Guide (PSI p. 320, ESI p. 324, 
USI p. 327) for each student. Draw a line under the last word used if you called fewer than 
the total number and adjust the possible total points at the bottom of each feature column.
2.	 Score the words by checking off the features spelled correctly that are listed in the cells to 
the right of each word. For example, if a student spells bed as BAD, he gets a check in the 
initial b cell and the final d cell, but not for the short vowel. Write in the vowel used (a, in 
this case), but do not give any points for it. If a student spells train as TRANE, she gets 
a check in the initial tr cell and the final n cell, but not for the long vowel pattern. Write 
in the vowel pattern used (a–e in this case), but do not give any points for it. Put a check 
in the “Correct” column if the word is spelled correctly. Do not count reversed letters as 
errors but note them in the cells. If unnecessary letters are added, give the speller credit 
for what is correct (e.g., if bed is spelled BEDE, the student still gets credit for represent-
ing the consonants and short vowel), but do not check “Correct” spelling.
3.	 Add the number of checks under each feature and across each word, double-checking the 
total score recorded in the last cell. Modify the ratios in the last row depending on the 
number of words called aloud.
Interpreting the Results of the Spelling Inventory
1.	 Look down each feature column to determine instructional needs. Students who miss 
only one (or two, if the features sample 8 to 10 words) can go on to other features. Stu-
dents who miss two or three need some review work; students who miss more than three 
need careful instruction on this feature. If a student did not get any points for a feature, 
earlier features need to be studied first.
2.	 Determine a development stage by noting where students first make two or more errors 
under the stages listed in the shaded box at the top of the Feature Guide and circle the 
stage.
3.	 Use power scores or total number correct as a guide to calling the stage. Refer to the 
Power Scores and Estimated Stages table in Chapter 2.

Using the Classroom Composite and Spelling-by-Stage 
Classroom Organisation Chart
1.	 Staple each Feature Guide to the student’s spelling paper and arrange the papers in rank 
order from highest to lowest total points or use raw scores.
2.	 List students’ names in this rank order in the left column of the appropriate Classroom 
Composite (PSI p. 320, ESI p. 324, USI p. 327) and transfer each student’s total feature 
scores from the Feature Guide to the Classroom Composite. If you did not call out the 
total word list, adjust the numbers on the Possible Points row of the Classroom Com-
posite.
3.	 Highlight cells where students make two or more errors on a particular feature to get a 
sense of your students’ needs and to form groups for instruction.
4.	 You may find it easier to form groups using the Spelling-by-Stage Classroom Organi­
sation Chart (p. 322). List each student under the appropriate spelling stage (the stage 
circled on the Feature Guide) and determine instructional groups.
The online assessment tool on the website can automate many of these steps for you.
Note: See Chapter 2 for more detailed directions on choosing, administering, scoring and interpreting the 
inventories, as well as using them to form instructional groups.

Primary Spelling Inventory (PSI)
The Primary Spelling Inventory (PSI) is used in kindergarten through third grade. The 26 
words are ordered by difficulty to sample features of the letter name–alphabetic to within 
word pattern stages. Call out enough words so that you have at least five or six misspelled 
words to analyse. For kindergarten students or other emergent readers, you may only need to 
call out the first five words. In late kindergarten and early first-grade classrooms, call out at 
least 15 words so that you sample digraphs and blends; use the entire list for late first, second, 
and third grades. If any students spell more than 22 words correctly, you may want to use the 
Elementary Spelling Inventory.
Using the following list, call out the spelling word, then the sample sentence, then repeat 
the spelling word.

Elementary Spelling Inventory (ESI)
The Elementary Spelling Inventory (ESI) covers more stages than the PSI. You can use it as 
early as first grade, particularly if a school system wants to use the same inventory across the 
elementary grades. The 25 words are ordered by difficulty to sample features of the letter 
name–alphabetic to derivational relations stages. Call out enough words so that you have at 
least five or six misspelled words to analyse. If any students spell more than 20 words correctly, 
use the Upper-Level Spelling Inventory to get a more accurate estimate of a student’s ability; 
at the upper level, the ESI can overestimate the stage.

Upper-Level Spelling Inventory (USI)
You can use the Upper-Level Spelling Inventory (USI) in upper elementary, middle school, 
high school and postsecondary classrooms. The 31 words are ordered by difficulty to sample 
features of the within word pattern to derivational relations spelling stages. With normally 
achieving students, you can administer the entire list, but you may want to stop when students 
misspell more than eight words and are experiencing noticeable frustration. If any students 
misspell five of the first eight words, use the ESI to more accurately identify within word 
pattern features that need instruction.

Appendix C  Pictures for Sorts and Games
You can use the pictures that follow in a number of ways. For example, you can use them like 
clip art to create picture sorts. Refer to Chapters 4 and 5 for suggested contrasts for picture 
sorts , or create your own. Simply make copies of the pictures you need (combining two, three 
or four sounds) and glue them randomly onto a template, such as the one in Appendix F on 
page 400. You will probably want to enlarge the pictures about 50 percent, and insert labels 
from the sound board boxes as headers. You may also want to make a complete set of pictures 
for modelling, small-group work or centres. Glue or copy pictures to card stock, and perhaps 
colour them, and laminate the card stock for durability. Use the pictures for games and other 
activities as well.
Pictures are grouped by beginning consonants, digraphs, blends, short vowels and long 
vowels. The following list will help you find pictures for rhyme sorts, word families, additional 
short vowels and long vowels. The picture names in bold type are in either the short or long 
vowel picture section, while the others can be found by their beginning sounds.

The sample word sorts on the following pages are arranged sequentially by spelling stage. 
Prepare word sorts for your students by writing the words on a template such as the one in 
Appendix F on page 401. Be sure to write the words on the template randomly so that students 
can make their own discoveries as they sort. Consider the following information when using 
these sorts.
• These sorts are not intended to be a sequence for all students. Chapter 2 will help you 
match your students to the spelling stages. Each instruction chapter contains additional 
suggestions about the pacing and sequencing of word study for each stage. Choose appro-
priate sorts from among those presented here.
• This is not an exhaustive list of sorts, but it does give you a starting point for creating your 
own. You can adapt these sorts by adding, deleting or substituting words that are more 
appropriate for your students. Word lists are provided in Appendix E.
Letter Name–Alphabetic Sorts
Letter name–alphabetic spellers will also need to study initial consonants, digraphs, blends and 
short vowels with picture sorts. Use the pictures in Appendix C to create these sorts and refer 
to Chapter 5, Table 5.5, for a scope and sequence.

Creating Your Own Word Sort Sheets
The following lists of words are organised by features students need to study in the letter 
name–alphabetic through derivational relations stages. Under each feature the words are 
generally grouped by frequency and complexity. For example, under short-a, the early part of 
the list offers words most likely encountered by first graders (am, ran, that). The latter part of 
the list contains words that may be obscure in meaning and spelled with blends or digraphs 
(yam, brass, tramp). Fry’s 300 instant words listed on page 366 are the most frequent words and 
should be included in beginner sorts.
The lists include possible exceptions or oddballs that can be added to sorts. Sometimes 
the oddballs you include will be true exceptions (such as said in a sort with long-a patterns), 
but other times oddballs may represent a less common spelling pattern, such as ey representing 
long-a in prey and grey.
Prepare word sorts to use with students by writing the selected words on a template such 
as the one on page 401 in Appendix F. We recommend that you enlarge the template about 5 to 
8 percent before writing in the words neatly. Be sure to insert the words randomly so students 
can make their own discoveries as they sort. Many people find it easy to create computer-
generated word sort sheets using the “table” function in a word processing program. First, 
set the margins all around at 0.5 inches, and then insert a table that is three columns by six to 
eight rows. Save the blank template to use again. Type in words in each cell, leaving a blank 
line before and after each word. After typing in all words, “select” the entire table and click 
on the “centre” button. Choose a simple font (Ariel and Geneva work well) and a large font 
size (26 works well). After creating the sort, save it using a name that defines the features such 
as “Short Vowels: a, o, e”. You can contrast sounds, spelling patterns, word endings, prefixes, 
root words and so on. Here are some reminders and tips about creating your own word sorts.
1.	 Create sorts that will help students form their own generalisations about how words work. 
Use a collection of 15 to 25 words so that there are plenty of examples to consider.
2.	 Contrast at least two and up to four, features in a sort. There are many sample sorts in 
Appendix D to give you ideas.
Examples of sound sorts:
Contrast short-o and long-o.
Contrast the sound of ear in learn and in hear.
Contrast the sound of g in guest and gym.
Examples of pattern sorts:
Contrast long-o spelled with oa, o-e and ow.
Contrast words that end with or, er and ar.
Contrast words that double a consonant before -ing with those that do not.
Examples of meaning sorts:
Contrast words derived from spect and port.
Contrast words with prefixes sub, un and trans.
The best sorts are those that combine a sound sort with a pattern sort. For example, a 
long-o and short-o sort can begin with a sound sort and then proceed to sort the long 
vowels by patterns—CVVC and CVCe.
3.	 Consider whether you want to underline key words or create headers for the sort. Your 
decision will depend on the level of support you feel your students need, as described in 
Chapter 3.
4.	 In most sorts, include up to three oddballs when possible—words that have the same sound 
or pattern but are not consistent with the generalisation that governs the other words. 
For example, in a long-o sort, with words sorted by the oa, o-e and ow patterns, the excep-
tions might include the words now and love since they look like they would have the long-o 
sound but do not. The best oddballs are high-frequency words students already know from 
­reading. These are listed under Oddballs in the word lists in this appendix.

5.	 Words in a sort can be made easier or harder in a number of ways:
• Common words like hat or store are easier than uncommon words like vat or boar. It 
is important to use words students know from their own reading in the letter name–
alphabetic and within word pattern stages to make sorts easier. This is less important 
when you get to syllables and affixes and derivational relations stages in which words 
sorts can help to extend a student’s vocabulary.
• Add words with blends, digraphs and complex consonant units (e.g., ce, dge or tch) to 
make words harder. Bat and blast are both CVC words, but blast is harder to read and 
spell.
• Adding more oddballs to a sort makes the sort harder. But don’t use oddballs students 
are not likely to know (like plaid in a long-a sort for students early in the within word 
pattern stage).

Appendix F  Games and Templates for Sorts
Game Boards
This appendix contains templates for picture and word sorts as well as games. Figures F.1 
through F.8 are templates that you can use to create some of the games described throughout 
the book. Note that there are two sides for each game board. When the two sides are placed 
together, they form a continuous track or path. These games can be adapted for different 
features and levels. Here are some general tips for creating the games.
1.	 Photocopy the game boards (enlarge slightly) and mount them on coloured manila file 
folders, making them easy to create and store. Place game materials, such as spinners, 
word cards or game markers, in plastic bags or envelopes labelled with the name of the 
game and stored in the folder. You might mark the flip side of word cards in some way 
so that lost cards can be returned to the correct game. Rubber stamp figures work well.
2.	 When mounting a game board in a folder, be sure to leave a slight gap (about an eighth 
of an inch) between the two sides so that the folder will still fold. If you do not leave this 
gap, the paper will buckle. Trim the sheets of paper so the two new sides line up neatly, or 
cut around the path shape and line up the two pieces of the pathway.
3.	 Various objects (buttons, plastic discs, coins and bottle caps) can be used for game mark-
ers or pawns that the students will move around the board. Flat objects store best in the 
folders, or you may want to put a collection of game markers, dice and spinners in a box. 
Store the box near the games, and students can take what they need.
4.	 Add pizazz to games with pictures cut from magazines or old workbooks, stickers, comic 
characters, clip art and so on. Rubber stamps, your drawings or students’ drawings can be 
used to add interest and colour. Create catchy themes such as Rabbit Race, Lost in Space, 
Through the Woods, Mouse Maze, Rainforest Adventure and so forth.
5.	 Include directions and correct answers (when appropriate) with the game, stored inside 
along with playing pieces or glued to the outside of the folder.
6.	 Label the spaces around the path or track according to the feature you want to reinforce, 
and laminate the board for durability. If you want to create open-ended games that can 
be adapted to a variety of features, laminate the path before you label the spaces. Then 
you can write in letters or words with a washable overheard pen and change them as 
needed. Permanent marker can also be used and removed with hairspray or fingernail 
polish remover.
7.	 Add interest to the game by labelling some spaces with special directions (if you are using 
a numbered die or spinner) or add cards with special directions to the deck of words. 
Special directions can offer the students a bonus in the form of an extra turn or a penalty 
such as losing a turn. These bonus or penalty directions can tie in with your themes. For 
example, in the Rainforest Adventure the player might forget a lunch and be asked to go 
back to the starting space. Keep the reading ability of your students in mind as you create 
these special directions.
Spinners
Many of the word study games described in this book use a game spinner. Figure F.8 provides 
simple directions for making a spinner.

cardboard base
1. Glue a circle 3"  to 4" in diametre onto a square
     of heavy cardboard or foamcore that is about
     5" square. Square spinner bases are easier to hold
     than round ones. 
2.  Cut a narrow slot in the centre of the circle with
     the point of a sharp pair of scissors or a razor blade.
3.  Cut the pointer from soft plastic (such as a
     milk jug) and make a clean round hole with
     a hole punch.
4.  A washer, either a metal one from the hardware
     store or one cut from the same plastic as the 
     spinner, helps the pointer move freely.
5.  Push a paper fastener through the round hole of the 
     pointer, the washer and the slot in the spinner base.
     Flatten the legs, leaving space for the pointer to
     spin easily. Put a piece of tape over the flattened
     legs of the paper fastener.

Glossary
absorbed (assimilated) prefixes  Prefixes in which the spelling 
and sound of the consonant has been absorbed into the spelling 
and sound at the beginning of the base or root to which the 
prefix is affixed (e.g., ad + tract = attract).
academic vocabulary  Academic vocabulary includes domain-
specific vocabulary found in content area, specialised, disci-
plinary texts (e.g., dendrite in biology, coordinates and equilateral 
in geometry, electoral college in government), as well as general 
academic vocabulary used across content areas and disciplines 
(e.g., analyse, define, factors, method, principle).
accented/stressed syllable  The syllable in a word that receives 
more emphasis when spoken and usually has a clearly pro-
nounced vowel sound. Compare to unaccented syllable.
affix  Most commonly a suffix or prefix attached to a base word, 
stem or root.
affixation  The process of attaching a word part, such as a prefix 
or suffix, to a base word, stem or root.
affricate  A speech sound produced when the breath stream is 
stopped and released at the point of articulation, usually where 
the tip of the tongue rubs against the roof of the mouth just 
behind the teeth, such as when pronouncing the final sound in 
the word such or the beginning sound in the word trip. Includes 
the sounds for /ch/, /sh/, /j/ and /tr/.
alliteration  The occurrence in a phrase or line of speech of two 
or more words having the same beginning sound (e.g., Big 
burly bears bashed berry baskets.).
alphabetic  A writing system containing characters or symbols 
representing individual speech sounds.
alphabetic layer  The first layer of word study instruction, fo-
cusing on letter–sound correspondences. Old English was pho-
netically regular to a great extent.
alphabetic principle  The concept that letters and letter com-
binations are used to represent phonemes in orthography. See 
also orthography; phoneme.
ambiguous vowels  A vowel sound represented by a variety 
of different spelling patterns or vowel patterns that repre-
sent a wide range of sounds (e.g., the ou in cough, through and  
could).
analytic phonics  Word study that divides words into their el-
emental parts through phonemic, orthographic and morpho-
logical analysis.
articulated/articulation  Sounds are physically shaped in the 
mouth during speech using the tongue, teeth, lips and the roof 
of the mouth. Some confusions are made in spelling based on 
similarities in articulation (e.g., tr for dr).
assimilated prefixes  See absorbed (assimilated) prefixes.
automaticity  Refers to the speed and accuracy of word recogni-
tion and spelling. Automaticity is the goal of word study in-
struction and frees cognitive resources for comprehension.
base word  A word to which prefixes and/or suffixes are added. 
For example, the base word of unwholesome is whole. See free 
morphemes.
blends   A phonics term for an orthographic unit of two or 
three letters at the beginning or end of words that are blended  
together. There are l-blends such as bl, cl and fl; r-blends such 
as gr, tr and pr; s-blends such as pc, scr and squ; and final blends 
such as ft, rd and st. Every sound represented in a blend is pro-
nounced, if only briefly.
blind sort  A word sort done with a partner in which students 
who are responsible for sorting cannot see the word. They must 
instead attend to the sounds and sometimes visualise the spell-
ing pattern to determine the category.
blind writing sort  A variant of a blind sort in which one stu-
dent (or teacher) names a word without showing it to another 
student, who must write it in the correct category under a key 
word.
bound morphemes  Meaning units of language (morphemes) 
that cannot stand alone as a word. Respected has three bound 
morphemes: re+spect+ed. Compare to free morphemes.
centre time  Work completed independently in prepared areas 
within a classroom.
choral reading  Oral reading done in unison with another per-
son or persons.
circle time  Group work conducted under the teacher’s 
­direction.
classroom composite  A classroom profile that organises stu-
dents into instructional groups by features to be taught within 
each stage.
closed sorts  Word or picture sorts based on predetermined cat-
egories. Compare to open sorts.
closed syllable  A syllable that ends with or is “closed” by a con-
sonant sound. In polysyllabic words, a closed syllable contains a 
short-vowel sound that is closed by two consonants (e.g., rabbit, 
racket). Compare to open syllable.
cognates  Words in different languages derived from the same root.
complex consonant patterns  Consonant units occurring at the 
end of words determined by the preceding vowel sound. For 
example, a final tch follows the short-vowel sound in fetch and 
scotch, while a final ch follows the long-vowel sound in peach and 
coach. Other complex consonant patterns include final ck (pack 
vs. peak) and final dge (badge vs. cage).
compound words  Words made up of two smaller words. A com-
pound word may or may not be hyphenated, depending on its 
part of speech.
concept of word in text (COW-T)  The ability to match spo-
ken words to printed words, as demonstrated by the ability to 
point to or track, the words of a memorised text while reading.
concepts about print (CAP)  Understandings about how books 
are organised (front-to-back page turning, titles, illustrations), 
how print is oriented on the page (top to bottom, left to right), 
and features of print such as punctuation and capitalisation.
concept sorts  A categorisation task in which pictures, objects or 
words are grouped by shared attributes or meanings to develop 
concepts and vocabulary.

	 438	
G lo s s a r y
consolidated alphabetic phase  Ehri’s fourth phase of word rec-
ognition, in which readers use patterns, chunks and other word 
parts to figure out unfamiliar words.
consonant alternation  The process in which the pronunciation 
of consonants changes in the base or root of derivationally re-
lated words while the spelling does not change (e.g., the silent-
to-sounded g in the words sign and signal; the /k/ to /sh/ pattern 
in the words music and musician).
consonant blend  See blends.
consonant digraph  See digraph.
consonants  Letters that are not vowels (a, e, i, o and u). Whereas 
vowel sounds are thought of as musical, consonant sounds are 
known for their noise and the way in which air is constricted 
as it is stopped and released or forced through the vocal tract, 
mouth, teeth and lips.
continuant sound  A consonant sound, such as /ssssss/ that can 
be prolonged as long as the breath lasts without distorting the 
sound quality. Includes the consonant sounds for /f/, /l/, /m/, 
/n/, /r/, /s/, /v/, /w/ and /th/. See stop consonants.
cut and paste activities  A variation of picture sorting in which 
students cut out pictures from magazines or catalogues and 
paste them into categories.
derivational affixes  Affixes added to base words that affect the 
meaning (sign, resign; break, breakable) and/or part of speech 
(beauty, beautiful). Compare to inflected/inflectional endings.
derivational relations   The last stage of spelling develop-
ment, in which spellers learn about derivational relationships 
preserved in the spelling of words. Derivational refers to the 
process by which new words are created from existing words, 
chiefly through affixation, and the development of a word from 
its historical origin. Derivational constancy refers to spelling pat-
terns that remain the same despite changes in pronunciation 
across derived forms. For example, bomb retains the b from bom-
bard because of its historical evolution.
developmental level  An individual’s stage of spelling develop-
ment: emergent, letter name–alphabetic, within word pattern, 
syllables and affixes or derivational relations.
developmental spelling   Spelling that reflects the current word 
knowledge of students who spell “as best they can”. Also called 
invented spelling.
dialogic reading  An approach to reading aloud that is designed 
to stimulate oral language and dialogue while enhancing stu-
dents’ ability to retell stories.
digraph  Two letters that represent one sound. There are con-
sonant digraphs and vowel digraphs, though the term most 
commonly refers to consonant digraphs. Common consonant 
digraphs include sh, ch, th and wh. Consonant digraphs at the 
beginning of words are onsets.
diphthong  A complex speech sound beginning with one vowel 
sound and moving to another within the same syllable. The oy 
in boy is a diphthong, as is the ou in cloud.
directionality  The left-to-right direction used for reading and 
writing English.
domain-specific academic vocabulary  See academic vocabulary.
draw and label activities  An extension activity for a picture sort 
in which students draw pictures of things that begin with the 
sounds under study. The pictures are drawn in the appropriate 
categories and labelled with the letter(s) corresponding to that 
sound.
echo reading  Oral reading in which the student echoes or imi-
tates the reading of the teacher or partner to offer support for 
beginning readers and to model fluency.
emergent  A period of literacy development ranging from birth 
to beginning reading. This period precedes the letter name–­
alphabetic stage of spelling development.
eponyms  Places, things and actions that are named after an  
individual.
etymology  The study of the origin and historical development 
of words.
feature analysis  More than scoring words right and wrong, 
feature analyses provide a way of interpreting students’ spell-
ing errors by taking into account their knowledge of specific 
orthographic features such as consonant blends or short vow-
els. Feature analyses inform teachers what spelling features to  
teach.
feature guide  A tool used to classify students’ errors within a hi-
erarchy of orthographic features. Used to score spelling inven-
tories to assess students’ knowledge of specific spelling features 
at their particular stage of spelling development and to plan 
word study instruction to meet individual needs.
free morphemes  Meaning units of language (morphemes) that 
stand alone as words. (Workshop has two free morphemes: work 
and shop.) Compare to bound morphemes.
frustration level  A dysfunctional level of instruction where 
there is a mismatch between instruction and what an individual 
is able to grasp. This mismatch precludes learning and often 
results in frustration.
full alphabetic readers/phase  Ehri’s third phase of word rec-
ognition, in which readers are able to sound out words using 
letter–sound correspondences or phonics they know.
general academic vocabulary  See academic vocabulary.
generative  The approach to word study that emphasises or-
thographic principles that apply to many words, as opposed 
to an approach that focuses on individual words. Generative 
instruction addresses the combination of base words, Greek 
and Latin word roots and affixes in order to generate students’ 
understanding of how most words in the English language  
work.
headers  Words, pictures or other labels used to designate cat-
egories for sorting.
high-frequency words  Words that make up roughly 50 per-
cent of any text—those that occur most often (e.g., the, was, 
were, is).
homographs  Words that are spelled alike but have different pro-
nunciations and different meanings (e.g., “tear a piece of paper” 
and “to shed a tear”; “lead someone along” and “the element lead”).
homonyms  Words that share the same spelling but have differ-
ent meanings (tell a yarn, knit with yarn). See homographs; homo-
phones; polysemous.

	
G lo s s a r y 	
439
homophones  Words that sound alike, are spelled differently, 
and have different meanings (e.g., bear and bare, pane and pain, 
and forth and fourth).
independent level  That level of academic engagement in which 
an individual works independently, without need of instruc-
tional support. Independent-level behaviours demonstrate a 
high degree of accuracy, speed, ease and fluency.
Indo-European (IE) root  Indo-European is the “mother” lan-
guage to over half of the world’s languages.
inflected/inflectional endings  Suffixes that change the verb 
tense (walks, walked, walking) or number (dogs, boxes) of a word.
instructional level  A level of academic engagement in which in-
struction is comfortably matched to what an individual is able 
to grasp. See also zone of proximal development (ZPD).
interactive read-alouds   A reading format to support emergent 
reading where the teacher reads aloud to the students and in-
vites discussion and other participation.
interactive writing  A cooperative instructional strategy where-
by a text is composed with student input and the writing is 
done largely by the students under supervision to create an ac-
curately spelled final version. It can be used to model writing 
strategies and concepts about print.
invented spelling   Also known as spelling “as best you can”; al-
lows students to write even before they can read during the 
emergent stage.
key pictures  Pictures placed at the top of each category in a pic-
ture sort. Key pictures act as headers for each column and can 
be used for analogy.
key words  Words placed at the top of each category in a word 
sort. Key words act as headers for each column and can be used 
for analogy.
kinetic reversal  An error of letter order (PTE for pet).
language experience approach  An approach to teaching read-
ing, in which students dictate to a teacher, who records their lan-
guage. Dictated accounts can then be used as familiar reading 
materials.
lax  Lax vowels are commonly known as the short-vowel sound.
letter name–alphabetic spelling stage  The second stage of 
spelling development, in which students represent beginning, 
middle and ending sounds of words with phonetically accurate 
letter choices, often based on the sound of the letter name it-
self, rather than learned letter–sound associations. The letter 
name h (aitch), for example, produces the /ch/ sound, and is 
often selected to represent that sound (HEP for chip).
liquids  The consonant sounds for /r/ and /l/, which, unlike oth-
er consonant sounds, do not obstruct air in the mouth. The 
sounds for /r/ and /l/ are more vowel-like in that they do not 
involve direct contact between the lips, tongue and the roof of 
the mouth as other consonants do. Instead, they “roll around” 
in the mouth, as if liquid.
long vowels  Every vowel (a, e, i, o and u) has two sounds, com-
monly referred to as “long” and “short”. The long-vowel sound 
“says its letter name” and frequently are paired with other vow-
els as in bake and beak. See tense.
meaning layer  The third layer of English orthography, includ-
ing meaning units such as prefixes, suffixes and word roots. 
These word elements were acquired primarily during the 
Renaissance, when English was overlaid with many words of 
Greek and Latin derivation.
meaning sorts  A type of word sort in which the categories are 
determined by semantic categories or by spelling–meaning 
connections.
memory reading  An accurate recitation of text accompanied by 
fingerpoint reading.
mock linear  A kind of pretend writing where children begin-
ning to write approximate the broader contours of the writing 
system, starting with the linear arrangement of print.
morphemes (or morphemic)  Meaning units in the spelling of 
words, such as the suffix -ed, which signals past tense or the 
root graph in the words autograph or graphite. See also bound 
morphemes; free morphemes.
morphemic analysis  The process of analysing or breaking down a 
word in terms of its meaning units or morphemes (e.g., in-struct-or).
morphology  The study of word parts related to syntax and 
meaning.
nasals  A sound, such as /m/, /n/ or /ng/, produced when the 
air is blocked in the oral cavity but escapes through the nose. 
The first consonants in the words mom and no represent nasal 
sounds.
oddballs  Words that do not fit the targeted feature in a sort.
onset  The initial consonant(s) sound of a single syllable or word. 
The onset of the word sun is /s/. The onset of the word slide is 
/sl/. See rimes.
open sorts  A type of picture or word sort in which the catego-
ries for sorting are left open. Students sort pictures or words 
into groups according to the students’ own judgment. See closed 
sorts.
open syllable  Syllables that end with a long-vowel sound (e.g., 
la-bor, sea-son). Compare to closed syllable.
orthography  The writing system of a language—specifically, the 
correct sequence of letters, characters or symbols.
other vowels  Vowels that are neither long nor short and include 
r-influenced vowels and diphthongs, such as oy or ou.
partial alphabetic readers/phase  Ehri’s second phase of word 
recognition, in which students use partial clues, primarily ini-
tial consonants, to identify words. Also known as selective cue 
stage.
pattern  A letter sequence that functions as a unit to represent a 
sound (such as ai in rain, pain and train) or a sequence of vow-
els and consonants, such as the consonant-vowel-consonant 
(CVC) pattern in a word such as rag or at a syllable juncture 
such as the VCCV pattern in button.
pattern layer  The second layer or tier of English orthography, 
in which patterns of letter sequences, rather than individual 
letters themselves, represent vowel sounds. This layer of in-
formation was acquired during the period of English history 
following the Norman invasion. Many of the vowel patterns of 
English are of French derivation.

	 440	
G lo s s a r y
pattern sort  A word sort in which students categorise words ac-
cording to similar spelling patterns.
personal readers  Individual books of reading materials for be-
ginning readers. Group experience charts, dictations, rhymes, 
and short excerpts from books comprise the majority of the 
reading material.
phoneme  The smallest unit of speech that distinguishes one 
word from another. For example, the t of tug and the r of rug 
are two phonemes.
phoneme segmentation  The process of dividing a spoken word 
into the smallest units of sound within that word. The word bat 
can be divided or segmented into three phonemes: /b/, /ă/, /t/.
phonemic awareness  The ability to consciously manipulate in-
dividual phonemes in a spoken language. Phonemic awareness 
is often assessed by the ability to tap, count or push a penny 
forward for every sound heard in a word like cat: /c/, /ă/, /t/.
phonetic  Representing the sounds of speech with a set of dis-
tinct symbols (letters), each denoting a single sound. See also 
alphabetic principle.
phonics  The systematic relationship between letters and sounds.
phonics readers  Beginning reading books written with con-
trolled vocabulary that contain recurring phonics elements.
phonograms  Often called word families, phonograms end in 
high-frequency rimes that vary only in the beginning conso-
nant sound to make a word. For example, back, sack, black and 
track are phonograms with the rime -ack.
phonological awareness  An awareness of various speech sounds 
such as syllables, rhyme and individual phonemes.
picture sort  A categorisation task in which pictures are sorted 
into categories by sound or by meaning. Pictures cannot be 
sorted by pattern.
polysemous (or polysemy)  The characteristic of words to have 
multiple meanings; derived from poly- (“many”) + sem- the Lat-
in root referring to “meaning”).
prealphabetic readers phase  Ehri’s first phase of word recog-
nition, in which students use nonalphabetic clues, like word 
length or distinctive print, to identify words. Also known as 
logographic.
preconsonantal nasals  Nasals that occur before consonants, as 
in the words bump or sink. The vowel is nasalised as part of 
the air escapes through the nose during pronunciation. See also 
nasals.
predictable  Text for beginning readers with repetitive language 
patterns, rhythm and rhyme and illustrations that make it easy 
to read and remember.
prefix  An affix attached at the beginning of a base word or word 
root that changes the meaning of the word.
prephonetic  Writing that bears no correspondence to speech 
sounds; literally, “before sound”. Prephonetic writing occurs 
during the emergent stage and typically consists of random 
scribbles, mock linear writing or hieroglyphic-looking symbols.
pretend reading  A paraphrase or spontaneous retelling told by 
students as they turn the pages of a familiar story book.
print referencing  The practice of referring to features of print 
such as punctuation, capital letters, directionality and so forth 
as a way to teach students concepts about print. See also concepts 
about print (CAP).
prosodic/prosody  The musical qualities of language, including 
intonation, expression, stress and rhythm, that contribute to 
fluency.
reduced vowel  A vowel occurring in an unstressed syllable. See 
also schwa.
rimes  A unit composed of the vowel and any following conso-
nants within a syllable. For example, the rime unit in the word 
tag is ag. See also onset.
r-influenced (r-controlled) vowels  In English, r colours the way 
the preceding vowel is pronounced. For example, compare the 
pronunciation of the vowels in bar and bad. The vowel in bar is 
influenced by the r.
root word/roots  Words or word parts, often of Latin or Greek 
origin, that are often combined with other roots to form words 
such as telephone (tele and phone). See also stem.
salient sound  A prominent sound in a word or syllable that 
stands out because of the way it is made or felt in the mouth.
schwa  A vowel sound in English that often occurs in an un-
stressed syllable, such as the /uh/ sound in the first syllable of 
the word above.
seatwork  School work that is completed at the student’s own 
desk. Seatwork is usually on a student’s independent level and is 
usually assigned for practice. See also independent level.
semiphonetic  Writing that demonstrates some awareness that 
letters represent speech sounds (literally, “part sound”). Be-
ginning and/or ending consonant sounds of syllables or words 
may be represented, but medial vowels are usually omitted 
(e.g., ICDD for I see Daddy). Semiphonetic writing occurs at 
the end of the emergent stage or the very outset of the early 
letter name–alphabetic stage.
shared reading  An activity in which the teacher prereads a text 
and then invites students join in on subsequent readings.
short vowels  Every vowel (a, e, i, o and u) has two sounds, com-
monly referred to as “long” and “short”. The vocal cords are 
more relaxed when producing the short-vowel sound than the 
long-vowel sound. Because of this, short-vowel sounds are of-
ten referred to as lax. The five short vowels can be heard at the 
beginning of these words: apple, Ed, igloo, octopus and umbrella. 
Compare to long vowels.
sight words/sight vocabulary  Printed words stored in memo-
ry by the reader that can be read immediately, “at first sight”, 
without having to use decoding strategies.
sound board  Charts used by letter name–alphabetic spellers 
that contain pictures and letters for the basic sound–symbol 
correspondences (e.g., the letter b, a picture of a bell and the 
word bell).
sound sort  Sorts that ask students to categorise pictures or 
words by sound as opposed to visual patterns.
speed sorts  Pictures or words that are sorted under a timed con-
dition. Students try to beat their own time.
spelling-by-stage classroom organisation chart  A classroom 
composite sheet used to place students in a developmental 
spelling stage and form groups.
spelling inventories  Assessments that ask students to spell a 
series of increasingly difficult words used to determine what 

	
G lo s s a r y 	
441
features students know or use but confuse, as well as a specific 
developmental stage of spelling.
spelling–meaning connections  Words that are related in mean-
ing often share the same spelling despite changes in pronunciation 
from one form of the word to the next. For example, the word sign 
retains the g from signal even though it is not pronounced, thus 
“signalling” the meaning connection through the spelling.
static reversal  A handwriting error that is the mirror image of 
the intended letter (b for d or p for d).
stem   This usually refers to a base or word root together with 
any derivational affixes that have been added, and to which in-
flectional endings may be added.
stop consonants  A consonant sound such as /t/ that is formed 
by briefly obstructing air in the vocal track followed by a puff 
of air; stop consonant sounds (/b/, /d/, /g/, /k/, /p/ and /t/) can-
not be prolonged without distorting the sound. Also known as 
plosives.
stressed/accented syllable  The syllable in a word that is given 
an added emphasis when spoken and marked with bold letters 
or accent marks in the dictionary (e.g., ap’ ple or ap ple).
structural analysis  The process of determining the pronuncia-
tion and/or meaning of a word by analysing word parts includ-
ing syllables, base words and affixes.
suffix  An affix attached at the end of a base word or word root.
syllable juncture  The transition from one syllable to the next. 
Sometimes this transition involves a spelling change such as 
consonant doubling or dropping the final -e before adding 
-ing.
syllable juncture patterns  The alternating patterns of conso-
nants (C) and vowels (V) at the point where syllables meet. For 
example, the word rabbit follows a VCCV syllable pattern at the 
point where the syllables meet.
syllables  Units of spoken language that consist of a vowel that 
may be preceded and/or followed by several consonants. Syl-
lables are units of sound and can often be detected by paying 
attention to movements of the mouth. Syllabic divisions indi-
cated in the dictionary are not always correct because the dic-
tionary will always separate meaning units regardless of how 
the word is pronounced. For example, the proper syllable divi-
sion for the word naming is na-ming; however, the dictionary 
divides this word as nam-ing to preserve the ing.
syllables and affixes stage  The fourth stage of spelling devel-
opment, which coincides with intermediate reading. Syllables 
and affixes spellers learn about the spelling changes that often 
take place at the point of transition from one syllable to the 
next. Frequently this transition involves consonant doubling or 
dropping the final -e before adding a suffix.
synchrony  Occurring at the same time. In this book, stages of 
spelling development are described in the context of reading 
and writing behaviours occurring at the same time.
synthetic phonics  Phonics instruction that begins with individ-
ual sounds and the blending of sounds to form words.
teacher-directed sorts  An explicit word study lesson in which 
the teacher models and leads students through the sorting pro-
cess, offers explanations and facilitates a discussion about the 
features and the meaning of words.
tense  A vowel sound that is commonly known as the long-vowel 
sound. Long-vowel sounds are produced by tensing the vocal 
cords.
tracking  The ability to fingerpoint read a text, demonstrating 
concept of word in text. See concept of word in text (COW-T ).
unaccented/unstressed syllable  The syllable in a word that 
gets little emphasis and may have an indistinct vowel sound, 
such as the first syllable in about, the second syllable in definition 
or the final syllables in doctor or table. See also schwa.
unvoiced (or voiceless)  A sound that, when produced, does 
not cause the vocal cords to vibrate. For example, the t in at 
is unvoiced. Voiced/voiceless consonant contrasts include these 
pairs: [/p/ /b/], [/t/ /d/], [/k/ /ɡ/], [/ch/ /g/], [/f/ /v/], [/s/ /z/]. In 
most languages, vowels are voiced.
voice pointing  A strategy used by emergent readers to identify a 
word in a memorised rhyme or familiar text.  They go back to 
the beginning of the text and start reciting it in their heads (or 
out loud) while mentally pointing to each word as it is recited 
until they arrive at the word in question.
voiced  A sound that, when produced, vibrates the vocal cords. 
The letter sound of d in add, for example, vibrates the vocal 
cords. Compare to unvoiced.
vowel  A speech sound produced by the easy passage of air through 
a relatively open vocal tract. Vowels form the most central sound 
of a syllable. In English, vowel sounds are represented by the fol-
lowing letters: a, e, i, o, u and sometimes y. Compare to consonants.
vowel alternation  The process in which the pronunciation of 
vowels changes in the base or root of derivationally related words, 
while the spelling does not change (e.g., the long-to-short vowel 
change in the related words crime and criminal; the long-to-schwa 
vowel change in the related words impose and imposition).
vowel digraphs  A phonics term for pairs of vowels that repre-
sent a single vowel sound (such as ai in rain, oa in boat, ue in 
blue). Compare to digraph.
vowel marker  A silent letter used to indicate the sound of the 
vowel. In English, silent letters are used to form patterns as-
sociated with specific vowel sounds. Vowel markers are usually 
vowels, as the i in drain or the a in treat, but they can also be 
consonants, as the l in told.
whole-to-part model  A technique for fostering early literacy 
development using the shared reading of a whole texts fol-
lowed activities involving the parts (sentences, words, letters, 
and sounds).
within word pattern spelling stage  The third stage of spell-
ing development, which coincides with the transitional period 
of literacy development. Within word pattern spellers have 
mastered the basic letter–sound correspondences of written 
English and they grapple with letter sequences that function 
as a unit, especially long-vowel patterns that include silent  
letters.
word  A unit of meaning. A word may be a single syllable or a 
combination of syllables. A word may contain smaller units of 
meaning within it. In print, a word is separated by white space. 
In speech, several words may be strung together in a breath

group. For this reason, it takes a while for young students to 
develop a clear concept of word. See also concept of word.
word bank  A collection of known words harvested from fre-
quently read beginning reading materials. Word bank words 
are written on small cards and stored for review and use in word 
study games and word sorts.
word cards  Words written on 2-by-1-inch pieces of cardstock 
or paper.
word consciousness  An attitude of curiosity and attention to 
words critical for vocabulary development.
word families  Phonograms or words that share the same rime. 
(For example, fast, past, last and blast all share the ast rime.) In 
the derivational relations stage, word families refers to words 
that share the same root or origin, as in spectator, spectacle, inspect 
and inspector. See phonograms; rimes.
word hunts  A word study activity in which students go back to 
texts they have previously read to hunt for other words that 
follow the same spelling features examined during the word or 
picture sort.
word root  See root word/roots.
word sort  A basic word study routine in which students group 
words into categories. Word sorting involves comparing and 
contrasting within and across categories. Word sorts are often 
cued by key words placed at the top of each category.
word study  A learner-centred, conceptual approach to instruc-
tion in phonics, spelling, word recognition and vocabulary, 
based on a developmental model.
word study notebooks  Notebooks in which students write their 
word sorts into columns and add other words that follow simi-
lar spelling patterns throughout the week. Word study note-
books may also contain lists of words generated over time, such 
as new vocabulary, homophones, cognates and so on.
writing sorts  An extension activity in which students write the 
words they have sorted into categories.
zone of proximal development (ZPD)  A term coined by the 
Russian psychologist Vygotsky, referring to the ripe conditions 
for learning something new. A person’s ZPD is that zone which 
is neither too hard nor too easy. The term is similar to the con-
cept of instructional level.
