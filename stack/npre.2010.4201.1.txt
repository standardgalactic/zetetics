ABSTRACT
Many important cellular processes are regulated by reaction-diffusion (RD)
of molecules that takes place both in the cytoplasm and on the membrane.
To model and analyze such multicompartmental processes, we developed
a lattice-based Monte Carlo method, Spatiocyte that supports RD in vol-
ume and surface compartments at single molecule resolution. Stochasticity
in RD and the excluded volume effect brought by intracellular molecular
crowding, both of which can signiﬁcantly affect RD and thus, cellular
processes, are also supported. We veriﬁed the method by comparing sim-
ulation results of diffusion, irreversible and reversible reactions with the
predicted analytical and best available numerical solutions. Moreover, to
directly compare the localization patterns of molecules in ﬂuorescence
microscopy images with simulation, we devised a visualization method
that mimics the microphotography process by showing the trajectory of
simulated molecules averaged according to the camera exposure time. In
the rod-shaped bacterium Escherichia coli, the division site is suppressed
at the cell poles by periodic pole-to-pole oscillations of the Min proteins
(MinC, MinD and MinE) arising from carefully orchestrated RD in both cy-
toplasm and membrane compartments. Using Spatiocyte we could model
and reproduce the in vivo MinDE localization dynamics by accounting
for the previously reported properties of MinE. Our results suggest that
the MinE ring, which is essential in preventing polar septation, is largely
composed of MinE that is transiently attached to the membrane indepen-
dently after recruited by MinD. Overall, Spatiocyte allows simulation and
visualization of complex spatial and reaction-diffusion mediated cellu-
lar processes in volumes and surfaces. As we showed, it can potentially
provide mechanistic insights otherwise difﬁcult to obtain experimentally.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I thank Professor Martin Robert for guiding me in research and being a
positive role model since the beginning of my stay in Japan. I hope in
the future if I have my own students, I will be as genuinely concerned as
he is of their research and welfare. I appreciate Professor Masaru Tomita
for providing me the crucial support for my studies at Keio University
and creating a very conducive environment for research in a small town
such as Tsuruoka. His approach in encouraging graduate students to be
independent and responsible of their own research has greatly inspired
and motivated me. I thank Dr Koichi Takahashi for introducing me to the
E-Cell System, his advice on research and for always looking out for my
best interests.
I appreciate the views from my thesis committee members, Professor
Mitsuhiro Itaya and Professor Yasuhiro Naito. I am also grateful to all the
Keio University professors and staff – Ayumi Mikami and Akiko Shiozawa
have gone beyond their call of duty to help me get settled to the life in
Japan and fulﬁll my obligations as a Keio graduate student. I appreciate
the kind help and the company of my friends at the Tsuruoka Town
Campus of Keio University, especially Likai Mao, Dr Hu Bin, Lucy Zhang,
Dr Qiu Dongru, Dr Aminul Hoque, Bereczki Gabor, Dr Richard Baran, Dr
Masahiro Sugimoto, Takeshi Sakurada, Kenjiro Kami, Dr Azusa Kuroki,

problem that he is faced with – he is truly an old school engineer. My
mother is the mother every child hopes for – being born her son is my
greatest fortune. When I was back in Malaysia, every morning without
fail she would prepare the breakfast and bring it to my workstation. Her
circadian clock is the most sensitive and reliable system that I have seen
in a person, and I think I may have inherited it. My brothers, Siva and
Nathan have been the voice of reason and have never failed to show me
the big picture whenever I felt like I am lost. I am proud to have a caring
and independent young sister like Vani.
My wife, Gracy has been the greatest source of strength, support and
motivation although we were separated by distance throughout my time
in Japan. My feeling of loneliness in Tsuruoka was only mitigated by her,
even if it was only via Skype. I am truly thankful that I had met her on a
corridor of my undergraduate alma mater over a decade ago and that she
has stuck with me after all these years.

INTRODUCTION
Molecular systems biology is a ﬁeld that is concerned with understand-
ing the processes in a cell as a unit rather than as the sum of its parts
(Ideker et al., 2001; Kitano, 2002). Since the processes involve a network of
biomolecular interactions, direct reasoning or intuition alone may not be
adequate to understand them, and computational modeling and analysis,
which are the integral parts of systems biology, become necessary. As
shown in Figure 1.1, methods for computational modeling correspond to
the level of abstraction or speciﬁcity of a system (Ideker and Lauffenburger,
2003). At the top level of abstraction, where qualitative features of a system
are usually represented by the model, statistical mining techniques such as
hierarchical clustering (Eisen et al., 1998; Brown et al., 2000) and artiﬁcial
intelligence approaches such as support vector machines (Ramaswamy
et al., 2001) help to reveal the key components of the model and potential
interlinks by connecting dependent with independent variables. In the
network, the conditional dependency of a child node on a parent can
be determined using Bayesian networks (Sachs et al., 2002, 2005) while
Boolean (Huang and Ingber, 2000) and fuzzy-logic models (Ressom et al.,
2003) help to predict the logical rules regulating the dependencies. At a
lower level of abstraction, where quantitative information of the system is
more relevant, hidden Markov models (Riley et al., 2008) can probabilisti-
cally model the creation, removal and interconversion of molecular species
and states, whereas when we are concerned with the rates of biochemical
reactions, ordinary differential equations (ODE) (Bever, 2008; Boyce, 2008)
can be used. Finally, at the bottom level abstraction, the structural infor-
mation of the system and the dynamic localization of molecules, resulting
from diffusion and intracellular transport, can be modeled using spatial
modeling methods such as partial differential equations (PDEs), spatial

Figure 1.1: Computational modeling methods corresponding to system
abstraction levels. The prominent computational methods to model a sys-
tem are listed in the Models column. The methods are arranged according
to the abstraction levels of the target system, as shown by the blue arrow.
Highly abstract methods are listed at the top while increasingly speciﬁed
models are arranged toward the bottom. The left column shows the type of
information that can be gathered at various abstraction levels (indicated by
the red arrow) using the corresponding methods. Highly speciﬁed models
suffer from high computational cost although more detailed information
can be gathered. Hence, as the methods become less abstract, the size
of the target system needs to be reduced to cope with the increasing
computational cost. Adapted from (Ideker and Lauffenburger, 2003) with
permission from Elsevier, © 2003.
Some of the fundamental processes in the cell, such as cell division and
signaling, require models with the lowest level of abstraction because they
are strongly dependent on the structural information and the dynamic
location of molecules. In the rod-shaped bacterium Escherichia coli for
example, the Min system of proteins (Lutkenhaus, 2007), comprising
MinC, MinD and MinE, oscillates from one pole to the other to direct the
position of division to the middle of the cell long axis. By dividing in
the middle, the cell ensures equal distribution of its contents to the two

introduction
daughter cells. The proteins can oscillate in the presence of ATP because of
the carefully orchestrated reaction and diffusion in the cytoplasm and on
the inner membrane of the cell. As a result, without reaction, diffusion and
the structural information of the cell, it is not possible to model the system
accurately. Recently, computational models showed that although the
proteins were initially uniformly distributed in the cell, the stochasticity
in reaction-diffusion (RD) triggers the oscillation (Fange and Elf, 2006).
In signaling processes, extracellular cues captured by receptor proteins
on the cell membrane are transduced inward to regulate target proteins or
gene expression. Molecular diffusion and the signal transduction reactions
are the two interconnected underpinnings of the cellular response to the
cues. The biophysical properties of the cell structure and environment
can inﬂuence diffusion, and by introducing non-linear delays, contribute
to the overall signaling characteristics of the system. The signiﬁcance of
diffusion in RD systems is pronounced when reactions are comparatively
faster than diffusion rates, i.e., the reactions are diffusion-limited. To this
end, the Stokes-Einstein relation (Einstein, 1905) indicates that proteins,
which are the key components in the signaling, have a slow diffusion rate
because they are dense macromolecules. The phosphorylation state of
target molecules with spatially separated membrane protein kinases and
cytosolic phosphatases also depends heavily on diffusion (Kholodenko
et al., 2000). In addition, subcompartments diffusively formed by localized
proteins can signiﬁcantly alter the effects of noise on signaling (Bhalla,
2004), implying the important coupling of noise and diffusion.
Very high protein density in the intracellular space, commonly called
molecular crowding, can magnify the spatial effects. In a typical cell,
the total macromolecular density is 50-400 mg/ml (Fulton, 1982), much
higher than typical in vitro values of 1-10 mg/ml. If identical globular
proteins occupy 30% of the volume of a solution, less than 1% of the
remaining space is available to an additional molecule of the same size
because of steric repulsion (Zimmerman and Trach, 1991). The mutual

1.1 spatial modeling methods
impenetrability of macromolecular solutes is called the excluded volume
effect. In such environments, the observed translational diffusion rate of
proteins is about 5-20 times slower than in saline solutions (Elowitz et al.,
1999). The anomalous diffusion, deﬁned as sub-linear scaling of mean-
squared displacement of the molecule over time, is used as a measure for
cytoplasmic crowding (Weiss et al., 2004). Molecular crowding can also
alter protein activities and reaction kinetics (Ridgway et al., 2008). For
reviews about the inﬂuence of molecular crowding on thermodynamics
and volume exclusion, including experimental ﬁndings and biochemical
reactions in physiological media, see (Minton, 2001) and (Hall and Minton,
2003).
Taken together, cellular processes involving molecular interactions that
are tightly dependent on RD and spatial features of the cell require low-
level and highly speciﬁc modeling methods. The methods should not
only incorporate RD and structural information, but also the effects from
molecular crowding and stochasticity in the simulations. In the next section,
we review the features of existing spatial modeling methods.
1.1
spatial modeling methods
Spatial modeling methods can be broadly categorized into molecular
dynamics, PDEs, Brownian dynamics, lattice-based and spatial Gillespie.
Figure 1.2 illustrates the different kinds of approaches used by the methods
to incorporate space when modeling a system, while Table 1.1 summarizes
their features. We brieﬂy discuss the methods in the following subsections.

(A) Particles are usually given motions according to some kind of force

GFRD employ an optimization technique that allows particles to jump in

can travel in the time slot. Discrete space representation discretizes the
space either by subvolumes (voxels) of an identical shape (typically cubic)
or a regular lattice. (C) In this microscopic lattice, at most one particle is

to reside in a single lattice site. This class of discrete space representation
is called mesoscopic. (E) Mesh space here means conventional structured

biochemical simulators usually make use of compartmental space, which

transfers between compartments are not modeled as implicit built-in rules
in the simulation method (such as diffusion), but in an explicit way such
as membrane transporters. Adapted from (Takahashi et al., 2005) with

1.1 spatial modeling methods
Table 1.1: Features of spatial modeling methods (cont.). This table,
adapted and updated from our review in (Takahashi et al., 2005), summa-
rizes the features of current computational methods employing spatial rep-
resentations to model biochemical pathways. Spatial Representation: in
continuum space, molecular species are represented by individually treated
discrete molecules that can move freely in a compartment, whereas in
lattice space, discrete molecules occupy and move between regular subvol-
umes or voxels within a lattice. Mesh space represents discrete molecules in
irregular triangulated (MCell) or tetrahedral (STEPS) surfaces, or tetrahe-
dral volumes (STEPS). Gradient space denotes lattice (Cell++) or mesh (Vir-
tual Cell) discretization scheme of the species concentration ﬁeld. MCell
uses continuum and mesh spaces for volume and surface molecules respec-
tively, whereas Cell++ employs continuum and gradient spaces for large and
small molecules respectively. Spatial Scale: in microscopic methods, each
instance of molecule is distinguished from others and modeled as an object
with a position either in continuum or lattice space. Macroscopic schemes
represent the species state as a concentration gradient. There are many
possible mesoscopic schemes between macro and micro realms. Mesoscopic
methods in this table treat molecules discretely, but do not track positions
in a compartment or within a subvolume. Temporal Evolution: simulation
time-stepping scheme. DEV, DT, and DES mean event-driven, time-driven,
and numeric solution of a continuous differential equation system, respec-
tively. Stochasticity: if the method is stochastic. Excluded Volume: if the
method can reproduce the excluded volume effect brought by molecules
with physical dimensions in a crowded compartment (Zimmerman and
Trach, 1991; Minton, 2001; Hall and Minton, 2003). Multicompartmental
RD: if the method can perform RD in volumes and on surfaces, and
between volume and surface compartments.
1.1.1
Molecular dynamics
Motions and interactions regulating all molecules constituting the cell arise
from fundamental physical rules. By computing the forces affecting every
molecule from many-body potentials in a particle space (Figure 1.2A) and
numerically integrating Newton’s laws over a small discrete time-step, the
molecular dynamics (MD) approach can potentially be used to compute
the macroscopic behavior of molecules in a system (Allen and Tildesley,
1989). However, the computational cost of MD simulation increases linearly
7
Nature Precedings : doi:10.1038/npre.2010.4201.1 : Posted 5 Feb 2010

1.1 spatial modeling methods
with the number of interacting atoms (Rottler and Maggs, 2004). Despite
being the most accurate and fundamental approach (Koplik and Banavar,
1995), MD cannot be used to simulate whole cell systems, which consist of
very large number of atoms arising from macromolecules. It has only been
used in problems involving time-scales of nanoseconds and space-scales of
tens of nanometers. For example, it was employed to illustrate the effects
of crowding in a cell on a small number of molecules (Baynes and Trout,
2004; Friedel and Shea, 2004).
1.1.2
Partial differential equations
Whereas the MD simulation approach deals with reaction and diffusion at
the molecular level (i.e. microscale), the spatial partial differential equa-
tions (spatial PDEs) approach computes the intracellular kinetics at the
macroscopic level. The Virtual Cell (Schaff et al., 1997, 2001; Slepchenko
et al., 2003) employs PDEs with the ﬁnite volume method (Smith, 1986) to
perform reaction and diffusion of mobile molecules in its spatial simula-
tion framework. Compartments in the framework can depict the spatial
structures of the system. These compartments are further divided into
ﬁnite subvolumes through a mesh-generator (Figure 1.2E), and numeri-
cal methods are used to solve the differential equations. Finer time-step
and subvolume sizes produce more accurate solutions but with higher
computational overhead. Despite being one of the most computationally
scalable spatial simulation algorithms, PDEs cannot accurately represent
intracellular noise because it is a deterministic approach. Noise has pro-
found implications especially when the number of molecules is small, as
in the case of transcription factors (Rao et al., 2002). Moreover, noise is
further ampliﬁed in ﬁnite subvolumes such as the one used by the Virtual
Cell because molecule numbers in each subvolume will be smaller than
when they are taken as a whole (Bhalla, 2004). Therefore, stochastic based
simulation approaches should be considered in such conditions. Next, we
8

1.1 spatial modeling methods
look at other methods which are more sophisticated than spatial PDEs,
but unlike MD, are still computationally tractable.
1.1.3
Brownian dynamics
Brownian dynamics (BD) is a stochastic modeling approach employing con-
tinuum space and time. In this particle based approach (Figure 1.2A), the
molecules exhibit noise as they are propagated according to the Langevin
equation (Coffey et al., 2004). The equation contains random forces that
are intended to represent the interaction between the diffusing and the im-
plicitly represented solvent molecules. BD has been applied successfully to
investigate electrostatic competition effects between substrates binding to
an enzyme (Elcock, 2002) and to observe how crowder molecules inﬂuence
the GroEL-GroES chaperonin machinery at the atomic scale (Elcock, 2003).
Hence, this approach can effectively simulate crowded environment, given
that the crowder molecules are explicitly represented in the simulation
space. Such representation, however, will incur very high computational
costs, owing to the increased frequency of collision events and the smaller
time-steps required to resolve them.
BD can be viewed as a numerical procedure to solve the Smoluchowski
equation (von Smoluchowski, 1917), which describes the diffusive en-
counter of molecules in solution. On the other hand, for two-body prob-
lems, it is possible to analytically solve the equation by using the Green’s
function (Economou, 2006). This approach was adopted by van Zon and
ten Wolde (2005a,b) when they developed an event-driven simulation
algorithm called Green’s function reaction dynamics (GFRD) (Figure 1.2B).
The basic idea is to reduce the many-body problem that constitutes the
biochemical system into a set of two-body problem by determining the
length of the time step to be sufﬁciently small. Although GFRD permits
larger time-steps when the particles are too far apart to react, this ad-
vantage is lost when simulating crowded environments. This is because

1.1 spatial modeling methods
GFRD retains the drawbacks of BD, which is the dependency of step siz-
ing scheme to the frequency of collision events. Nonetheless, this method
can represent the excluded volume effect and represent different sizes
and shapes of molecules. Smoldyn is another approach to numerically
realize the Smoluchowski model of diffusion-limited reactions (Andrews
and Bray, 2004). The molecules are represented as point particles (Fig-
ure 1.2A) with binding and unbinding radii, which are computed from the
macroscopic reaction rate of each species. A disadvantage of discrete-time
approaches in continuum space such as Smoldyn is that it is possible to
miss collisions when the length of time-steps are not sufﬁciently small.
Smoldyn can represent reduced diffusion speed in crowded environment
by placing impenetrable blocks in space (Lipkow et al., 2005). One of
the major consequences of the excluded volume effect is the dependency
of the diffusive movements on physical sizes of the diffusing molecules.
Unlike GFRD, dimensionless particles used in Smoldyn do not permit
accurate representation of the effect. CyberCell shares the same properties
of Smoldyn but the molecules can take different sizes (Ridgway et al.,
2008). As a result, it can reproduce the excluded volume effect in crowded
media. However, unlike Smoldyn, the present version of CyberCell does
not support RD on surfaces. MCell is a another BD simulation method
that can perform RD in both volume and surface compartments (Stiles
and Bartol, 2001). For surface RD, the space is discretized into convex
polygon meshes as illustrated in Figure 1.2E, whereas for reactions in
the solution, it uses regular meshes to reduce computational cost when
resolving molecular collisions. Similar to Smoldyn, MCell cannot model
the effects of molecular crowding because the molecules are represented
as point particles.

1.1 spatial modeling methods
1.1.4
Lattice-based methods
The cellular automata (CA) method employs a lattice of uniform vox-
els with a ﬁnite number of states that evolves in discrete-time (Weimar
and Boon, 1994; Alber et al., 2003). The transition of each automaton
(i.e., molecule) in the voxels is fully speciﬁed by its local interaction. The
molecule can propagate either along its velocity vector or according to its
diffusion rate to arrive at another voxel, and then collide or react with
other molecules. CA can be used to simulate RD at both microscopic
(Figure 1.2C) (Berry, 2002; Schnell and Turner, 2004; Wishart et al., 2005;
Boulianne et al., 2008) and mesoscopic (Figure 1.2D) spatial scales, having
single and multiple molecules in a voxel, respectively. Using lattice-based
methods, the effects of molecular crowding can be simulated when the
spatial scale is microscopic and the size of voxels follows the molecule
size. Lattice size and geometry (e.g., square, hexagonal or trigonal) can
also inﬂuence the outcome of simulation, as reported by Shimizu et al.
(2003) when they analyzed the Escherichia coli chemotaxis signaling path-
way using a CA-based Ising model. Large differences in molecule sizes
and numbers in the cells motivated Weimar (2002) to use CA to sim-
ulate enzymatic reaction networks at both mesoscale (metabolites) and
microscale (enzymes) simultaneously on a two-dimensional lattice. This
approach considerably reduces the memory requirement, especially when
considering large systems such as the cell. The size of the voxels can be
larger to accommodate large molecules, and as a result, fewer sites will
need to be created and stored in the memory. The reduced resolution of
the lattice would, however, translate to lower precision of the molecular
diffusion at each time-step. The local interaction nature of CA makes it
suitable for implementation on parallel architectures and hence, supports
reduction in the computational time required for 3D simulations. To our
knowledge, all microscopic lattice-based methods have not successfully
modeled volume-surface RD.

1.2 motivation
1.1.5
Spatial Gillespie
Stundzia and Lumsden (1996) extended the Gillespie’s stochastic approach
(Gillespie, 1976, 1977) to be used in subvolumes for spatial modeling. Their
method was employed to model the propagation of a calcium waves by
RD across a cell. Elf and Ehrenberg (2004) on the other hand, extended the
fast version of the Gillespie’s algorithm, the Next Reaction (NR) method
(Gibson and Bruck, 2000), to be used in subvolumes. The SmartCell (Ander
et al., 2004) and GMP (Rodríguez et al., 2006) simulators also implemented
a similar scheme. The subvolume sizes, as shown in (Figure 1.2D), are
determined such that all reactive molecular species, represented as point
particles, are almost uniformly distributed in each subvolume’s space. This
is done by ensuring that the diffusion of reactants in a subvolume takes
place more frequently (e.g., more than 100 times) than their respective
reactions. At each time-step, each molecule can either react in its current
subvolume or diffuse to an adjacent one. The diffusional probability at
each time-step is obtained by mapping the bulk diffusion constant in
Fick’s law using the Green’s function. Similar to the original NR method,
the computation time increases only logarithmically with the number of
subvolumes in the system. Nonetheless, it is not possible to reproduce
crowded conditions because volume exclusion from both reactive and
non-reactive crowder molecules cannot be represented explicitly when
they are depicted as point particles.
1.2
motivation
Ideally, spatial modeling methods should be able to run simulations with
minimal computational cost because the simulation time usually presents
as a bottleneck when a system is modeled at such high speciﬁcity. To this
end, discrete-event methods are promising because computation is only
performed at time steps when it is really necessary and as a result, larger
jumps in time is possible. In addition to stochasticity in simulation and
12

the effects of volume exclusion, a spatial modeling method should also
be able to perform RD on the surface, and between volume and surface
compartments. This feature becomes essential when modeling cellular
processes such as the bacterial cell division. However, as can be seen in
Table 1.1, none of the present methods have all the expected features.
In this thesis, we aim to develop a new lattice-based modeling method,
called Spatiocyte, which is sufﬁciently fast to run many simulation runs
of actual cellular processes. The method should be stochastic and able
to model the implications of molecular crowding. RD in the volume and
surface compartments should also be supported so that fundamental
cellular processes such as the division site control in bacteria can be
modeled accurately. Results from spatial modeling efforts are usually
veriﬁed by comparing with experimental data using images of in vivo
localization of ﬂuorescent labeled proteins. Since the images are highly
dependent on the exposure time of camera, a visualization method needs
to be developed to show the localization of simulated molecules that
mimics the output of the camera to directly and effectively compare the
result of simulations with that of experiments.

thesis organization
In the Chapter 2 of this thesis, the detailed description of the proposed
modeling method will be presented. To verify the correctness of the
method, simulation results of basic RD in volume and surface compart-
ments will be compared with analytical and numerical solutions. In ad-
dition, the new visualization method that mimics the ﬂuorescent labeled
protein images will be presented. In Chapter 3, the implementation details
of the method using the E-Cell System will be described. The implemented
method will be used to model the Escherichia coli MinDE dynamics and
compared with the results from experiments and previous computational
studies. In Chapter 4, the method is used to elucidate the mechanism of

of the Spatiocyte method to model polymerization of molecules on sur-
faces such as cell and nuclear membrane. Finally, in Chapter 6, the overall

A MULTICOMPARTMENTAL LATTICE-BASED
REACTION-DIFFUSION METHOD
Computational models are valuable to both theoretical and experimental
biologists to rapidly analyze and test their predictions about qualitative or
quantitative behavior of complex cellular processes (Ideker and Lauffen-
burger, 2003). Moreover, the models can potentially provide mechanistic
insights (Treanor and Batista, 2007; Clarke and Liu, 2008; Neves and Iyen-
gar, 2009), even in the case of relatively simple processes (Stefan et al.,
2008; van Albada and ten Wolde, 2009).
Processes that are strongly dependent on the cell morphology, multicom-
partmental interaction and dynamic localization of molecules such as cell
signaling (Rangamani and Iyengar, 2008; Neves et al., 2008), bacterial cell
division (Lutkenhaus, 2007; Adams and Errington, 2009) and chemotaxis
(Greenﬁeld et al., 2009; Rao and Ordal, 2009), require realistic models with
spatial representation (Takahashi et al., 2005; Ridgway et al., 2006; Morris
and Jensen, 2008). The processes rely on intricately controlled reaction and
diffusion of molecules in and between cytoplasm (or nucleoplasm) and
membrane compartments to perform their functions. Excluded volume
effect brought by molecular crowding in each compartment can reduce the
macroscopic diffusion coefﬁcient and alter reaction kinetics (Ellis, 2001;
Hall and Minton, 2003; Dix and Verkman, 2008; Klann et al., 2009). Fur-
thermore, the signiﬁcance of slower diffusion in such reaction-diffusion
(RD) processes is pronounced when the reactions are diffusion-limited.
Since some of the species involved in the processes comprise small number
of molecules, stochasticity in the reactions can dominate over the law of
mass action (Gillespie, 1976; Gómez-Uribe and Verghese, 2007), and thus
affecting the macroscopic behavior of the processes (Fange and Elf, 2006;
Rangamani and Iyengar, 2008; Hansen et al., 2008).

2.1 multicompartmental simulation space
In Chapter 1 we have looked at the prominent spatial modeling methods
with a summary of their features listed in Table 1.1. The table shows that
although a variety of methods have been developed, modeling cellular
processes at the level where multicompartmental RD, molecular crowding
and stochasticity all simultaneously come into play is still not possible
with any single method. To address this issue, in this chapter we develop
a general-purpose hybrid time- and event-driven, lattice-based Monte
Carlo simulation method, called Spatiocyte, to model processes that are
dependent on multicompartmental RD, stochasticity and the implications
of molecular crowding.
2.1
multicompartmental simulation space
In our method, molecules can participate in ﬁrst- or second-order reactions,
each giving away one or two product molecules. Free molecules can
diffuse within the simulation space either on a surface or in a volume
compartment. In vivo, where the compartments are crowded, diffusing
protein molecules collide even at very small time scales (Ellis, 2001). The
advantage of fully event-driven reaction-diffusion methods to make large
jumps in time when molecules are far apart (van Zon and ten Wolde,
2005b) is lost in such conditions (Ridgway et al., 2006; Takahashi et al.,
2005). Instead, we use a time-driven, lattice-based method to skip two
costly operations – molecule search and distance calculation – required
by off-lattice methods (Andrews and Bray, 2004; van Zon and ten Wolde,
2005b; Ridgway et al., 2008) to resolve collisions. Diffusion-independent
reactions, however, are event driven to further reduce the computational
cost.
We discretized the space into a hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattice
where each sphere voxel has 12 adjoining but non-overlapping neighbors
(Figure 2.1A). Each voxel is at most occupied by a single molecule to
account for volume exclusion and molecular crowding. The voxel radius
rv is uniform and set to the radius of individually simulated molecules.

such as boxes, spheres and cylinders can be used in combinations to deﬁne
compartment structures, cell shapes and intracellular geometries, which
may affect the model behavior.

2.2 diffusion
Compared to the lattice arrangements of other reaction-diffusion methods
(Novère and Shimizu, 2001; Ander et al., 2004; Elf and Ehrenberg, 2004;
Rodríguez et al., 2006; Sanford et al., 2006; Boulianne et al., 2008), the
HCP lattice has the highest density of sphere voxels (Szpiro, 2003). To
delineate a surface compartment such as a cell or a nuclear membrane,
we occupy all empty voxels of the compartment with immobile lipid
molecules (Figure 2.1B). Analogous to in vivo, these molecules aid lateral
diffusion of non-lipid surface species, while together as an immobile
structure, sequester volume species.
In addition to the diffusing and immobile species that are treated indi-
vidually at the molecular scale, there are also homogeneously distributed
(HD) species, such as ATP, that are simulated at the compartmental scale.
We consider a species HD only if it is mobile and evenly distributed within
the compartment before its reaction events. The species can satisfy these
conditions if its reaction events are not limited by its diffusion rate. Al-
ternatively, it can have a sufﬁciently high concentration that, after each
reaction event, even if it has a slower diffusion rate it can rapidly attain a
homogeneous concentration before the next event. Each molecule of the
HD species is not treated individually since the compartmental concentra-
tion information is sufﬁcient. For a biochemical species A, we denote A#
as the total molecule number in a compartment. All random numbers are
drawn independently from the uniform distribution.

diffusion
Applying the Einstein-Smoluchowski expression for diffusion

r2
=
2lDiτi (Einstein, 1905; von Smoluchowski, 1906), with l = 3 for volume
diffusion, a molecule i with diffusion coefﬁcient Di can walk to a ran-
domly selected neighbor voxel in a time step τi when the mean squared
displacement

r2
= (2rv)2 (Rodríguez et al., 2006). For a surface molecule,
the walk is constrained to adjoining surface voxels, l = 2 and the average

)2 for volume or surface
species, respectively. However, a volume molecule can only occupy the
target voxel if it is vacant, otherwise a collision occurs and the walk fails.
A surface walk is only successful if the target voxel is occupied by a lipid
molecule, in which case the lipid and the walking molecule exchange
voxels; a collision occurs if the target voxel contains a non-lipid surface
species. The above scheme accurately constrains molecules to their own
compartment without geometry calculations.
Molecules sharing a diffusion coefﬁcient Di are grouped in a diffusion
process di which executes their random walk together at ti
d. In long time-
scales, diffusion becomes a costly operation because of the very short
time steps required to make voxel-length random walks. To alleviate this
cost, every voxel has an address pointer to each of its neighbors as a
rapid means of access when checking for vacancy and molecule species. In
addition, only mobile molecules undergoing diffusion-inﬂuenced reactions,
usually found in small numbers, are individually diffused, while others
are simulated at the compartmental scale as HD species.

of the HCP lattice that are delineated as surface voxels to form the planes
xy, xz and yz respectively. Some of the voxels are ﬂatly spread (yz-plane),
while others are jagged and overlap when they represent the ﬂat surfaces
(xy- and xz-planes). The lateral displacement of a molecule walking voxel-
to-voxel on the planes, shown as white arrows in six directions, can be
less than 2rv because of the overlaps. As a result, to calculate the surface
diffusion step interval τi
d (see text) we use the average lateral displacement
rs that is computed from the average displacement on the three planes,
rxy, rxz and ryz. Similarly, ns is calculated from the average number of
voxels spread across the three planes, nxy, nxz and nyz.

the asymptotic reaction rate given by kaπRD/(ka + 4πRD), where ka is

2.3 diffusion-independent reactions
the intrinsic reaction rate, while R and D are the contact distance and
combined diffusion coefﬁcient, respectively.
Applying the asymptotic reaction rate, a second-order reaction involving
a HD reactant can also be decoupled from the diffusion or immobility of
the second reactant because before the reaction event, the concentration of
the HD species is the same at any location of the compartment. Likewise,
if both reactants are immobile, as long as they are in contact (via adjoining
voxels in the simulation), the rate of reaction is also unaffected. Taken
together, we can decouple diffusion from all ﬁrst-order reactions, and all
second-order reactions that involve two adjoining immobile reactants or at
least one HD reactant.
We perform event-driven diffusion-independent reactions by adapting
the NR method (Gibson and Bruck, 2000), a computer-optimized varia-
tion of the Gillespie algorithm (Gillespie, 1976, 1977) that stores reaction
dependencies in a directed graph and the time of next reactions in an
indexed priority queue. The steps in an iteration of the NR method are
as follows: (i) select the reaction m with the earliest next reaction time
tm
r
from the priority queue; (ii) execute reaction m and update species
molecule numbers; (iii) using the dependency graph, get every reaction µ
whose propensity aµ is affected by the updated species and recompute it:

The original method assumes all molecules to be HD species, which is
not the case in our approach. As a result, in step (ii), if m has a non-HD
reactant, we perform the reaction with a molecule selected randomly from
the reactant molecule list. A non-HD product of m replaces a non-HD
reactant at the same voxel. A second non-HD product will occupy a vacant
neighbor voxel of the ﬁrst product. A non-HD product of m involving
only HD reactants is placed in a random vacant voxel of the reaction
compartment. If it is an intercompartmental reaction, the product will take
up a vacant voxel adjoining both compartments. Because reactions are
diffusion-independent, we can avoid partitioning reaction volumes like in
other Gillespie-based spatial simulation methods (Elf and Ehrenberg, 2004;
Ander et al., 2004; Rodríguez et al., 2006; Bernstein, 2005).

diffusion-influenced reactions
Only two remaining second-order reactions, involving a diffusing and
an immobile reactant, and two diffusing reactants, that are diffusion
inﬂuenced. They are modeled using a spatially discretized version of the
Collins and Kimball approach (Collins and Kimball, 1949) that assigns
a ﬁnite probability p for a reactive collision between reactants. Next, we
derive the relationship between the reactive collision probability p and the
macroscopic rate constant of various diffusion-inﬂuenced second-order
reactions.

Volume-surface reactions
A volume molecule A can also collide with a surface molecule B and react
with probability p. Since each B only diffuses laterally on the surface, it
does not strike A in the volume compartment.
The number of volume voxels adjoining the surface compartment
on either side is also ns. Each of these volume voxels has three ad-
joining surface voxels. The probability for an A to collide with B at
the target voxel is Pr(the molecule A is occupying a voxel adjoining
the surface compartment) × Pr(a surface voxel is selected as the target
voxel) × Pr(target surface voxel contains B) × (number of collision evalua-
tions in the interval ∆t):

by default is occupied by a lipid molecule, B# = ns. To derive p for the

as in the previous volume-surface reaction but we now replace B# with ns

for collision, reducing the computational cost by several folds.

2.5 hybrid time- and event-driven simulation
If j is diffusion-limited, a reactive collision may occur at time slices
smaller than τA, causing pj > 1 and yielding inaccurate results. Here, for
a species i that participates in J number of diffusion-inﬂuenced reactions,
we limit its reaction probabilities to a maximum value Pi, 0 ⩽Pi ⩽1,
by reducing its diffusion process interval to τ′
i = τiPi/ρi, with ρi =
max{p1, . . . , pJ}. Consequently, (2.1) becomes

(2.25)
Note that if ρi > Pi, the walk probability is no longer unity because of
the reduced interval and is given as Pi/ρi. However, at each interval the
molecule can collide as usual with a neighbor reactant pair and react with
probability pjPi/ρi.
When the collision is reactive, the two reactants are removed and new
non-HD product(s) occupy the reactant or neighbor voxels, whereas for
HD product(s), only the species molecule number is updated. Since the
reactant and product molecule numbers have changed, we also perform
steps (iii) and (iv) of the adapted NR method for the diffusion-independent
reactions.

in an event-driven manner.

verification of diffusion-influenced reactions
To verify the diffusion-inﬂuenced reactions of our method we employ a
similar approach as in (Ridgway et al., 2008) by comparing the simula-
tion results with the predicted survival probability of reacting species
in irreversible (Sirr) and reversible (Srev) reactions. Here, we describe the
analytical and numerical methods to obtain Sirr and Srev since they have
not been previously described for surface reactions. Where possible we
adopt the notations in (Popov and Agmon, 2001).

simulating fluorescence microscopy images
Spatial localization patterns of molecules both in vitro and in vivo are
widely determined using ﬂuorescence labeling experiments (Resch-Genger
et al., 2008; Fernández-Suárez and Ting, 2008; Ji et al., 2008; Huang et al.,
2009). Co-localization patterns of multiple species of molecules can also
be determined using multiple ﬂuorescent labels. The merged localization
images show the blending of colors when the positions of the separately
labeled molecules overlap. However, the optical microscopy images suffer
from low resolution because of the diffracted light and the long exposure
time required by the camera in microphotography processes. The exposure
time of several hundred milliseconds to several seconds makes it impos-
sible to capture the position of diffusing molecules at single molecule
resolution. As a result, it is difﬁcult to directly compare the position of
molecules obtained from spatial simulations with the microscopy images.
Here, we develop a visualization method that simulates microscopy
images by displaying the trajectory of simulated molecules averaged ac-
cording to the exposure time. We use the OpenGL programming interface
for 3D computer graphics (Shreiner, 2009) to develop the method. We
adopt the RGBA mode of OpenGL, where the colors are represented by
red, green, blue and alpha color components. The alpha color component
allows a color to be blended with the existing color at the intended posi-
tion. An alpha value of 0 implies full transparency, while an alpha value of
1 implies full opacity. The background color of the simulation space is set
to black to represent the unlit space of the microscopy image. We record
the voxel position of each molecule, regardless of its diffusion coefﬁcient,
at each minimum diffusion step interval τm = min{τi}. For each voxel, the
number of times a molecule of a ﬂuorescent-labeled species f has occupied
it in the exposure time τe can then be counted, and is given as Nf. To
display the trajectory of the labeled species f within the exposure time,
the alpha value of each voxel is calculated as

while its RGB values are set to the species ﬂuorescent color. The above
step is repeated for the remaining ﬂuorescent labeled species. When
molecules of separately labeled species occupy the same voxel within the
exposure time, or overlap during visualization, their colors are blended
according to their opacity levels. In addition, the intensity of voxel colors
is directly proportional to the density of molecules at the position during
the exposure time, as it is the case in microscopy images.

Diffusion in volume and surface compartments is veriﬁed
Figure 2.3 shows that the mean squared displacements of freely diffusing
molecules in volume and surface compartments using Spatiocyte are
indistinguishable from expected analytic values. The diffusion of the
molecules is also correct when the walk probability Pi/ρi is less than unity
in a diffusion process interval τ′
i. Based on the results in Figure 2.3, the
multi-timescale algorithm is also veriﬁed because the diffusion of all four
species, in different compartment types and with unique combinations of
diffusion process intervals and walk probabilities, were simultaneously
and correctly simulated.

Spatiocyte is evaluated for reactions that are minimally to maximally

placed randomly in their respective compartment. A cubic volume with
periodic boundaries constitutes the volume compartment, while its six
faces, covered with lipid molecules and imposed with periodic boundary
condition at the edges, form the surface compartment. When a molecule
walks over a periodic boundary, its absolute coordinate is updated to emu-
late borderless volume and surface compartments. All four species, with
unique combinations of diffusion process interval τ′
i and walk probability
Pi/ρi, were simultaneously simulated to also verify the correctness of the
multi-timescale algorithm. In both compartments, the excluded volume
effect by the molecules is negligible because they occupy less than 0.01%
of the simulated volume and surface area.

is also veriﬁed since the eight reactions were simultaneously performed
correctly.
Compared to irreversible reactions, reversible reactions present a harder
test to spatial modeling methods because newly dissociated molecules
that are close to each other have a higher tendency to recombine. We

ecuted using the adapted NR method. Figure 2.5A and 2.5B show the
simulation results when the reactions take place in the volume and sur-
face compartments, respectively. Taking into account the noise limits, the
results are in good agreement with the best known approximation theory,
MPK1 in both compartments, thus verifying the diffusion-independent
and diffusion-inﬂuenced reactions of Spatiocyte. In addition, as previously
reported in (Ridgway et al., 2008), mass action fails to correctly reproduce
the predicted survival probability of A for volume reversible reactions
(Figure 2.5A) because it assumes A, B and C to be HD species. Figure 2.5B
shows that mass action is also unable to reproduce the expected curves
for surface reversible reactions.
2.8.3
Spatiocyte reproduces implications of molecular crowding
We evaluated Spatiocyte to reproduce the effects of volume exclusion by
ﬁrst examining the diffusion behavior of molecules in a crowded volume
compartment. We mimicked the crowded Escherichia coli cytoplasm by oc-
cupying 34% of the 1 µm3 compartment volume (Zimmerman and Trach,
1991) with inert and immobile crowder molecules. Figure 2.6A shows the
time-dependent diffusion coefﬁcients of six species that were diffused in
the compartment. Of the six species, one is an Escherichia coli division site
control protein, MinD with the diffusion coefﬁcient 61 µm2s−1, obtained
by ﬂuorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) in a dilute solution (Loose
et al., 2008). The results indicate that the species undergo anomalous diffu-
sion (i.e., sub-linear scaling of the mean-squared displacement over time)
when the volume compartment is crowded. Corroborating the results of
previous off-lattice simulations (Ridgway et al., 2008), the time-dependent
diffusion coefﬁcients reach equilibrium by 10−4 s, at which time they have
decreased by about a factor of two compared to dilute levels.
Using the same six species, we investigated the diffusion behavior in two
different cases of crowded surface compartment. In the ﬁrst case (Figure

in the surface compartment is because of the increased obstructions to
diffusion, resulting from the smaller dimensionality of the surface space
(Zhou, 2009). Interestingly in the second case, although the area occupancy

We evaluated the effects of molecular crowding in volume irreversible
reactions. Figure 2.6D shows that the apparent survival probability of the
reacting molecules increases in line with the volume occupancy. There
are more surviving reactants at higher occupancy because their time-
dependent diffusion coefﬁcient is reduced by the increased hindrances
from crowders. Together, these results conﬁrm that our method can account
for some of the important implications of molecular crowding in volume
and surface compartments.

Spatiocyte visualization method simulates microscopy images
Figure 2.7 compares the localization patterns of simulated molecules at
single molecule resolution to the corresponding simulated ﬂuorescence
microscopy image using the Spatiocyte visualization method. The radius
of the molecules, occupying an Escherichia coli membrane, is 10 nm while
the exposure time of the simulated image is 500 ms. Since the molecules
are very small, it is difﬁcult to identify the patterns at single molecule
resolution. Conversely, the patterns are clearly deﬁned in the simulated
ﬂuorescence image because the overall trajectory of molecules during the
exposure time is shown. Co-localizing molecules can also be identiﬁed by
their blended colors.
Comparisons of actual microscopy images to the corresponding sim-
ulated images are shown in Figure 4.1C. The left column of the panel
illustrates the in vivo localization patterns of MinD and MinE from the
doubly labeled experiments by Shih et al. (2002). Using an exposure time
of 500 ms, the Spatiocyte visualization method closely reproduces the
microscopy images in both individual and overlay panels. However, the
simulated patterns are not as smooth as in the microscopy images possibly
because the diffraction of light was not considered. It is also evident that
the visualizations of single molecules do not clearly show the localization
patterns as observed in the microscopy images.

discussion
In this chapter, we developed and veriﬁed a new lattice-based method,
Spatiocyte that can model surface and volume intercompartmental RD
processes, while also being able to account for the implications of stochas-
ticity and molecular crowding arising from the physical dimensions of
molecules. To our knowledge, there is currently no single method that can
do this (see Table 1.1). We have also adopted several optimization strategies
to reduce the high computational cost associated with spatial modeling
41

2.9 discussion
methods. Firstly, unlike other methods, Spatiocyte can simultaneously
simulate highly concentrated or HD species at compartmental scale and
low copy or heterogeneously distributed species at molecular scale. This
allows the method to skip diffusing each molecule belonging to the highly
concentrated species, which would incur very high computational cost.
Molecules within the two distinct spatial scales can react as usual with
each other. Secondly, the reactions involving HD species are event-driven
so that computations are performed only when necessary, thus allowing
bigger jumps in the simulation time. Thirdly, to support fast RD simula-
tion in crowded compartments, the simulation space is discretized into
hexagonal close-packed lattice that enables rapid resolving of molecular
collisions.
The obvious limitation of Spatiocyte is that the non-HD molecules have
to be almost similar in size to occupy the voxels. This presents a problem
when modeling molecules with disparate densities in a crowded compart-
ment since the size of the molecules directly inﬂuences RD. Nonetheless,
in most spatial modeling applications, the molecules are assumed to be
uniform sized. In addition, the method can also be extended to model
molecules of different sizes by occupying multiple voxels with a single
molecule according to its size. In this case, the reactive collision probability
will need to be readjusted to account for the collisions that take place at
the multiple voxels occupied by the molecule.
We also developed a visualization method that uses the temporal posi-
tional data of simulated molecules to simulate optical microscopy images
of ﬂuorescent labeled proteins. It does this by showing the trajectory of
simulated molecules averaged according to the camera exposure time
used in the microphotography process. The method enabled us to directly
match our simulation results with the localization patterns of MinD and
MinE in Escherichia coli and make objective evaluations. Schaub et al. (2007)
have also developed a method to simulate the microscopy images but it is
intended for almost immobile, non-diffusing structures, such as actin ﬁla-

ments, and cannot be directly applied for diffusing molecules as required
by our method.
In our results, the 34% crowded volume compartment caused the diffu-
sion coefﬁcient of MinD to be reduced by a factor of two to approximately
37 µm2s−1 from its dilute level of 61 µm2s−1 (Loose et al., 2008). How-
ever, the measured diffusion coefﬁcient of MinD in the 34% crowded
Escherichia coli cytoplasm is only 16 µm2s−1 (Meacci et al., 2006). The
additional twofold reduction can be attributed to the several factors listed
by Ridgway et al. (2008), which include the intracellular viscosity and the
nonspeciﬁc binding to other molecules in the cytoplasm. This suggests
that adding crowder molecules alone may not be sufﬁcient to reproduce
the cytoplasmic environment in a simulated model.
Our results also support the suggestion by Loose et al. (2008) that
molecular crowding on the cell membrane decreases the lateral diffusion
coefﬁcient of MinD compared to that of in vitro. Additional reduction in
the diffusion coefﬁcients could also be attributed to the protein oligomer-
ization and polymerization-depolymerization kinetics on the membrane.
Polymers on the membrane may also present as bigger hindrances to the
mobility of the proteins.

IMPLEMENTATION OF SPATIOCYTE WITH THE
E-CELL SYSTEM
The E-Cell System is one of the well known and advanced open-source
simulation platforms to model and analyze both small- and large-scale bio-
chemical reaction networks in living cells (Tomita et al., 1999). The driver
algorithm of the E-Cell System (version 3) supports concurrent executions
of multiple simulation algorithms, whose time steps are independently
advanced in continuous-time, discrete-time or discrete-event manner at
varying timescales (Takahashi et al., 2004). Multiple sessions of simulations,
usually required for estimation of reaction parameters and to obtain the
averaged results from stochastic reactions, can be simultaneously executed
with its distributed computing utility (Sugimoto et al., 2005; Sugimoto,
2009). Simulation runs can be automated and modiﬁed ex tempore with
Python scripting, while new simulation algorithms can be developed using
C++ and incorporated into the system as plug in modules.
Recent advances in molecular biology suggest that modeling reaction
networks alone is not sufﬁcient to accurately reproduce certain impor-
tant cellular processes such as cell division (Lutkenhaus, 2007) and gene
expression (Talbert and Henikoff, 2006). In Chapter 1 we have reviewed
how the physical location, crowding and diffusion of molecules in cell
compartments play crucial roles in these processes.
In the rod-shaped Escherichia coli, the division site is restricted to the mid-
cell by nucleoid occlusion and the pole-to-pole oscillation of the proteins
MinC, MinD and MinE, collectively called the MinCDE system (reviewed
by Lutkenhaus (2007)). The periodic oscillation is established because of in-
tricately controlled reaction and diffusion of the proteins in the cytoplasm
and the inner membrane. A simpliﬁed model of the system is illustrated
in Figure 3.1, which includes only MinD and MinE since MinC is not
necessary for the oscillation. Division at the midpoint of the cell is impor-

tant to ensure equal distribution of cell contents to the two daughter cells.
The MinCDE molecules, found in low copies in the cytoplasm and on the
inner cell membrane compartments, are not evenly distributed temporally.
As a result, the rate of reactions, which is determined by the frequency
of collision between reacting molecules, is inﬂuenced by diffusion and
physical localization within the compartments. The molecules undergo
surface and volume reaction-diffusion (RD) on the cell membrane and in
the cytoplasm respectively.
Current algorithm modules of the E-Cell System assume that reactions
take place between molecules that are uniformly distributed within the
reaction compartment. It is also not possible to specify the physical location
of each molecule. In this chapter, we describe the extension of the E-
Cell System to model the spatial localization and RD of molecules by
implementing the Spatiocyte method described in Chapter 2. Out of the
several available methods (see Table 1.1), ours is the only one that can
account for the important implications of volume exclusion by molecules
and RD in both volume and surface spaces. To evaluate the new approach,
we compare the simulation results of the MinDE system with the results
obtained from experiments and previous computational work.
3.1
methods
In this section, we brieﬂy recall the proposed RD scheme in Chapter 2
before providing the details of the implementation with the E-Cell System.
3.1.1
The reaction-diffusion scheme
Molecules diffuse freely in space by making random walks (Berg, 1993).
According to the Collins and Kimball theory (Collins and Kimball, 1949),
when two reactive molecules come into contact (i.e., collide), they react with
a certain probability p, which is related to the reaction rate constant k. To
avoid molecule search when checking for collisions, we have discretized the

Figure 3.1: The simpliﬁed oscillation model of the MinDE sytem in Es-
cherichia coli. This model is adapted from (Huang et al., 2003). MinC is not
represented because it is not essential for the oscillation. Arrows depict the
ﬁve basic reactions in the model. In the ﬁrst reaction, MinDADP exchanges
nucleotide to become MinDATP with the rate k1. In the form of MinDATP,
the molecule can bind to the membrane either autonomously with the rate
k2 or cooperatively with a another membrane-bound MinDm
ATP at the rate
k3. Cytosolic MinE is also recruited to the membrane by MinDm
ATP with the
rate k4 to form MinE.MinDm
ATP. The ATPase function of MinD is activated
by MinE in the MinE.MinDm
ATP complex and consequently, MinDATP is
converted to MinDADP that cannot stay bound to the membrane. This is
represented by the ﬁfth reaction, in which the MinE.MinDm
ATP complex
dissociates from the membrane at the rate k5 and forms the cytosolic
monomers MinE and MinDADP.
space into hexagonal close-packed lattice (Conway and Sloane, 1998). Each
sphere voxel in the lattice has 12 adjoining neighbor voxels. To account for
volume exclusion and molecular crowding, each voxel can be occupied by
a single molecule. The radius of the voxels is set according to the size of
diffusing molecules. A molecule can walk to a randomly selected neighbor
voxel in an interval τd following the Einstein-Smoluchowski expression
for diffusion

and D are the mean squared displacement and the diffusion
coefﬁcient of the molecule respectively, and l = 2 for surface diffusion
while for volume diffusion, l = 3. Since in the interval τd the molecule
walks to a neighbor voxel, the mean squared displacement is given by the
lattice spacing. We have derived the spacing for surface and volume diffu-
sion, and the connection between p and k in Chapter 2. At the destination
voxel, the walking molecule may collide with another molecule that is a
reactant pair and react if an independent random number drawn from a
unit uniform distribution is less than p.
3.1.2
E-Cell System data structure and driver algorithm
The speciﬁc details of the E-Cell System data structure, driver and inte-
gration algorithms have previously been described (Takahashi et al., 2004).
We brieﬂy provide the data structure and the driver algorithm here to
characterize the implementation of our algorithm modules. We adopt the
notations in (Takahashi et al., 2004) and capitalize the class names.
A reaction network system is represented in E-Cell as a Model, speciﬁed
by the user in E-Cell Model description language (EML), a subset of XML.
Figure 3.2 shows the data structure of the Model class, which contains a
list of state Variables and Steppers. The Stepper class is the main algorithm
module of the Model and it operates with a set of Processes, the current
local time τ and the step interval ∆τ, a step method that advances the
Stepper in time either in a continuous-time, discrete-time or discrete-event
fashion, and an interruption method that allows other Steppers to notify
the Stepper when they modify a read Variable of the Stepper. The Process is
a lower level algorithm module that directly reads or modiﬁes the state
Variables according to the algorithm using a transition-function. Here, the
instances of the state Variables are accessed by dereferencing the Variable
References.

3.1 methods
Figure 3.2: The data structure of the E-Cell Model.
Central to the E-Cell driver algorithm is a priority queue that arranges
the Steppers according to the scheduled time of execution, given as τ + ∆τ.
At initialization, the global time t and the local time τ of Steppers are reset.
Next, the step method of the Stepper Si with the minimum scheduled time
is called and the global time is updated to t = τi + ∆τi. The step method
also sets the local time to τi = τi + ∆τi and calls the transition function
of its Processes to update the state Variables. The method may also update
the next step size ∆τi and call the interruption method of other Steppers
whose read Variable has been modiﬁed. The Stepper Si is rescheduled in the
priority queue according to the new scheduled time. The same procedure
is repeated for the Stepper with the next earliest scheduled time in the
priority queue until the simulation is ended.
3.1.3
Implementation of reaction-diffusion with E-Cell
We have implemented the proposed reaction-diffusion scheme using the
E-Cell System by creating two basic algorithm modules – a Diffusion Process
and a Reaction Process. The molecules are represented as the state Variables
of the Model. For each diffusion coefﬁcient in simulation, a Diffusion Process
48
Nature Precedings : doi:10.1038/npre.2010.4201.1 : Posted 5 Feb 2010

3.2 application results
object is created to walk the molecules. Likewise, a Reaction Process object
is instantiated for every reaction involving a diffusing molecule. A discrete-
event Stepper advances the Diffusion Process in time and handles the lattice
structure and the physical location of molecules. The transition function of
the Diffusion Process walks each molecule to a randomly selected adjoining
voxel in a diffusion step interval. When a molecule collides with a reactant
pair, the transition function of the corresponding Reaction Process is called.
If the reactive collision probability is met, the Process removes the collided
molecules and replaces them with one or two product molecules, as
speciﬁed by the reaction.
3.2
application results
We modeled the oscillatory behavior of molecules in the MinDE system to
validate our approach because it involves both surface and volume RD, and
spatiotemporal localization of molecules. We describe the computational
model of the system before presenting the results of simulation.
3.2.1
The MinDE Model
In Escherichia coli, the FtsZ membrane protein initiates cell division phys-
ically by polymerizing and constricting annularly at the middle of the
long axis of the rod-shaped cell (Lutkenhaus, 2007; Löwe and Amos, 2009).
Although the protein can diffuse over the entire membrane, nucleoid oc-
clusion prevents the polymerization from taking place over the nucleoid
mass, leaving only the midcell and the two cell poles as viable locations for
polymerization (Woldringh et al., 1990, 1991; Bernhardt and de Boer, 2005).
Nonetheless, because of the inhibition by MinC proteins at the poles (Hu
et al., 1999; Hu and Lutkenhaus, 1999), the polymerization can only take
place at the midcell. During the cell cycle, MinD with the help of MinE
forms polar zones which oscillate from one pole to the other. Since MinC
49
Nature Precedings : doi:10.1038/npre.2010.4201.1 : Posted 5 Feb 2010

3.2 application results
piggybacks on MinD and the oscillation occurs on the rod-shaped cell
with some dwelling time at the poles, the time-averaged concentration of
MinC at the middle of the cell is kept low, permitting FtsZ to polymerize.
According to the model by Huang et al. (2003) (illustrated in Figure 3.1),
cytosolic MinD in the ATP-bound form (MinDATP) binds to the membrane
either cooperatively with another membrane bound MinD (MinDm
ATP)
or independently. MinE from the cytoplasm inhibits MinDm
ATP by ﬁrst
associating with it and setting off the ATPase function of MinD that
hydrolyzes the bound ATP to ADP. The membrane-bound MinE and the
ADP-bound form of MinD (MinDADP) then dissociate to the cytoplasm.
In the cytoplasm, MinDADP is phosphorylated and takes the form of
MinDATP again. MinC is not explicitly represented in the model because
it is usually attached to MinD and experimental data indicate that the
oscillation can take place without it (Hu and Lutkenhaus, 1999; Raskin
and de Boer, 1999). The series of reactions in the model are as follows:

Simulation Results
To simulate the MinDE oscillation model using the proposed approach,
we applied the parameters from (Fange and Elf, 2006) (listed in Table 3.1).
However, we reduced the radius of our voxels to more closely reﬂect the
size of diffusing molecules. Another variation between our method and
50

3.2 application results
the MesoRD method in (Fange and Elf, 2006) is that our molecules can
exhibit excluded volume.
Figure 3.3 shows the random distribution of cytosolic MinDADP, MinDATP
and MinE molecules at initialization. The pole-to-pole oscillation of membrane-
bound MinDm
ATP, as shown in Figure 3.4, is spontaneously triggered after
about 1 minute of simulated time although all molecules were initially
randomly distributed in the cytoplasm. For the 1 minute of simulated time,
it takes about 14 minutes of simulation on an Intel Core 2 Extreme 3.2 GHz
system with 8 GB of RAM. The oscillation has an average period of 36 sec-
onds which corresponds to what has been observed experimentally (Hale
et al., 2001; Raskin and de Boer, 1999). The period is also in close agreement
with the value from the previously reported computational model (Fange
and Elf, 2006). Consistent with the observations by Huang et al. (2003) and
Fange and Elf (2006), the period increased proportionally to the number of
MinD, while reduced proportionally to the amount of MinE in the model.
In addition, as observed in the MinDE localization studies in Escherichia
coli (Shih et al., 2002), the membrane-bound MinE.MinDm
ATP dimers appear
to be lagging behind MinDm
ATP molecules when they migrate from one
pole to the other. Taken together, our simulations closely reproduce the
results from both experimental and previous computational studies.
Here, we describe the steps that trigger the spontaneous oscillation.
Initially, all molecules are evenly distributed in the cytoplasm. Very small
number of MinDATP molecules begin to independently associate at ran-
dom locations on the membrane and rigorously recruit other MinDATP
molecules cooperatively. As shown in Figure 3.5, the recruitment gives
the appearance of growing patches on the membrane. Cytosolic MinE
molecules are attracted to these patches because of their high afﬁnity
to MinDm
ATP and form MinE.MinDm
ATP dimers. Soon the patches loosely
cover the entire membrane because the rate of MinD recruitment is faster
than the rate of dissociation, even after almost all MinE are found in the
MinE.MinDm
ATP dimer form on the membrane. At random locations on the

membrane, some MinDm
ATP patches are free from MinE inhibition because
of the limited cytosolic MinE molecules. In addition, these patches also
become more persistent at locations farther from the dissociating patches,
where they are less inhibited by the newly released MinE molecules and
where MinDATP can escape cooperative recruitment by MinDm
ATP in the
dissociating patches. Finally, patches (or polar zones) form alternately (i.e.,
oscillate) at the two poles of the cell because the poles are sufﬁciently far
from each other to avoid both the rapid inhibition by the released MinE
and the cooperative recruitment by MinDm
ATP. During the oscillation cycle,
the MinE.MinDm
ATP dimers appear to be lagging behind MinDm
ATP because
the released MinE molecules from the opposite pole ﬁnd MinDm
ATP at the
rim of the polar zone ﬁrst.
From the simulations, we observed several important features of the
MinDE system that support the periodic oscillations. When we increased
the nucleotide exchange rate of MinDADP to k1 = 1 s−1, the population of
MinDATP increased, resulting in more MinDm
ATP and longer polar zones.
Since there are more MinDm
ATP to be activated by MinE, the oscillation

period also increased to about 63 s. Conversely, the duration of an oscilla-
tion cycle is reduced to approximately 20 s when the rate is decreased to
k1 = 0.3 s−1 because of the limited number of MinDATP copies available.
The reactive collision probability p for MinDATP to associate indepen-
dently to the lipid molecules on the membrane (k2 = 0.0125 µms−1, p =
0.274 × 10−4) is about four orders of magnitude lower than to associate co-
operatively with another membrane-bound MinDm
ATP (k3 = 0.0149 µm3s−1, p =
0.16), even though the number of lipid molecules (~72000) is only about an
order of magnitude more than that of MinDm
ATP (~1400). This ensures that
MinDATP only binds to the membrane independently to nucleate bindings
of other MinDATP. When we increased k2 = 0.05 µms−1, MinDm
ATP were
found loosely distributed in the polar zone that extended beyond the mid-
cell because the enhanced nucleation rate allows MinDATP to successfully
bind almost anywhere on the membrane. Occasionally, there were no clear
deﬁnition of the polar zones, with MinDm
ATP and MinE.MinDm
ATP covering
the entire membrane. The oscillation period increased moderately to about
44 s. Reducing k2 = 0.0009 µms−1 shortened the period marginally to 33 s
and displayed erratic nucleation patterns, with the polar zones frequently
appearing and growing near the midcell. In addition, because of the de-
creased nucleation rate, cooperative membrane recruitments of MinDATP

When the rate of cooperative recruitment was increased to k3 = 0.034 µm3s−1,
the oscillation was not triggered because MinE cannot rapidly activate the

rigorously recruited MinDm
ATP. Therefore, both MinDm
ATP and MinE.MinDm
ATP
were uniformly distributed on the membrane. Setting k3 = 0.024 µm3s−1
stimulated the oscillation but the polar zones were not clearly deﬁned
and extended well over the midcell because of the larger population
of MinDm
ATP. The oscillation period also increased to approximately 50
s. Reducing k3 = 0.004 µm3s−1 also prevented the oscillation because
MinDATP cannot successfully bind to the membrane—MinE rapidly disso-
ciates them since their cooperative recruitment activity has been weakened.
However, setting k3 = 0.007 µm3s−1 started the oscillation with a reduced
period of about 30 s, while the polar zones were occasionally nucleated
near the midcell.
Reducing or increasing the MinE membrane recruitment rate k4 has
generally the opposite effect of k3. This is because the membrane associ-
ated MinE activates MinD ATPase function that dissociates MinD to the
cytoplasm. Increasing the rate to k4 = 0.4 µm3s−1 generated the oscil-
lation with a shortened period of about 30 s since more MinE.MinDm
ATP
are available to activate MinD. The polar zones were nucleated both near
the midcell and at the poles, resulting in their rapid growth in each cycle.
Conversely, setting k4 = 0.05 µm3s−1 produced polar zones that are not
clearly deﬁned with an oscillation period of approximately 41 s. Both polar
zones frequently appeared simultaneously with one usually covering more
than one half of the cell long axis.
The MinE.MinDm
ATP dissociation rate k5 has almost the same properties
as k4 but with higher efﬁcacy. When the rate was increased to k5 = 1.2 s−1,
the polar zones were shorter and cycled between the poles with a period
lasting approximately 12 s. The higher rate increases the population of free
MinE that can associate and activate other MinDm
ATP, thus reducing the
size of the polar zones and increasing the oscillation speed. On the other
hand when the rate was reduced to k5 = 0.5 s−1, the period increased
to about 54 s, while the polar zones were nucleated at the cell poles and
extended beyond the midcell.

concentration on the membrane. By increasing the diffusion coefﬁcient
twofold to Dmembrane = 0.02 µm2s−1, the polar zones extended beyond
the midcell and were not clearly deﬁned. The oscillation period was about
60 s. Increasing the coefﬁcient further to Dmembrane = 0.05 µm2s−1 did
not produce the oscillation.

conclusions
In this chapter, we have successfully extended the E-Cell System to
model RD on surface and in volume spaces with dynamic localization of
molecules by implementing the Spatiocyte method. A unique feature of
our method is that it can account for the important implications of volume
exclusion by molecules while performing RD in both volume and surface
spaces (see Chapter 2 and Arjunan and Tomita, 2009b). The correctness of
our method and implementation is demonstrated by the accurate repro-
duction of the MinD and MinE oscillation behaviors in Escherichia coli, as
observed in both experimental and previous computational studies. We
modeled the MinDE system because the proteins display unique proper-
ties such as spatiotemporal localization patterns on the membrane and

intercompartmental reactions. We have shown the impact of changing the
various reaction and diffusion parameters to the dynamic localization pat-
terns of the proteins. The results presented in this chapter have previously
been published in (Arjunan and Tomita, 2009a). A guide to model RD
systems with the implemented Spatiocyte method in the E-Cell System is
also available (Arjunan, 2009).
Recent experimental studies have shown that MinE forms an annular
structure around the membrane, called E-ring, which oscillates together
with the polar zone (Raskin and de Boer, 1997). The work in this chapter
can be further extended to model such localization patterns and elucidate
the mechanism of E-ring formation, which remains ambiguous. Therefore,
in Chapter 4, we propose a more detail model of the MinDE system that
incorporates the formation of E-ring. We also use Spatiocyte to verify the
model and uncover the mechanism of E-ring generation.

MECHANISM OF E-RING FORMATION
In this chapter, using Spatiocyte we model the Escherichia coli MinDE
division site control system and investigate the mechanism of MinE ring
formation, which remains unclear (Lutkenhaus, 2007). The rod-shaped bac-
terium begins to divide when the tubulin-homolog FtsZ, polymerizes into
a constricting annular structure (Z-ring) on the inner membrane (Adams
and Errington, 2009; Lutkenhaus, 2007). To ensure equal distribution of
cell contents to the two progeny cells, the constriction site is restricted to
the middle of the cell long axis by two mechanisms: (i) nucleoid occlusion,
which allows the Z-ring to assemble only at the midcell and the cell poles,
locations that are devoid of the nucleoid mass (Woldringh et al., 1990, 1991;
Bernhardt and de Boer, 2005), and (ii) carefully orchestrated RD of the
minB operon encoded proteins, MinC, MinD, and MinE, in the cytoplasm
and inner membrane, which suppresses polar Z-rings to avoid the mini-
celling phenotype (Lutkenhaus, 2007; Vats et al., 2009). The phenotype
is characterized by the formation of chromosomeless minicells by polar
septation and elongated cells with multiple chromosomes.
In the absence of MinE, the ATPase MinD in the ATP form, MinDATP
binds peripherally around the entire membrane (Raskin and de Boer,
1999). MinE, however, induces the MinD ATPase activity on the mem-
brane, causing hydrolyzed MinDADP to be released into the cytoplasm
and membrane-associated MinDATP to localize into a polar zone that oscil-
lates between the poles with a period of approximately 1 minute (Hu and
Lutkenhaus, 2001). The FtsZ inhibitor, MinC piggybacks on the oscillating
MinDATP (Hu et al., 2003; Zhou and Lutkenhaus, 2004), ensuring that its
time-averaged concentration is lowest at the midcell for the Z-ring assem-
bly while sufﬁciently high at the poles to abrogate nascent FtsZ polymers
(Hu et al., 1999; Hu and Lutkenhaus, 1999).

mechanism of e-ring formation
While the exact mechanism is not known, MinE also localizes annularly
to form the E-ring at the medial edge of the polar zone (Raskin and
de Boer, 1997). When the E-ring is disrupted, the polar zone extends over
the midcell and oscillates markedly slower, resulting in the minicelling
phenotype (Raskin and de Boer, 1997; Zhang et al., 1998; Shih et al., 2002).
In the absence of MinD, wild type MinE is always cytosolic. However,
based on the observations from recent studies we predict that the MinE
constituting the E-ring could be transiently attached to the membrane
without being directly tethered to membrane-bound MinD. Firstly, double-
label ﬂuorescence microscopy experiments by Shih et al. (2002) clearly
indicate that there is a higher density of MinE in the wild type E-ring than
that of MinD at the rim of the polar zone, ruling out the possibility that
all membrane-recruited MinE subunits are MinD-bound. In addition, the
width of the observed E-ring, which appears to be several times the length
of a MinE dimer, is also unlikely to be the direct result of MinE dimers
binding to MinD subunits at the rim. Truncated MinE N-terminal domain
can autonomously bind to the membrane in the absence of MinD, and in
the full length MinE, the binding domain is thought to be exposed upon
membrane recruitment by MinD (Ma et al., 2003).
Even though many computational models of the MinDE system have
been proposed (Howard et al., 2001; Meinhardt and de Boer, 2001; Kruse,
2002; Howard and Rutenberg, 2003; Huang et al., 2003; Drew et al., 2005;
Kerr et al., 2006; Fange and Elf, 2006; Pavin et al., 2006; Tostevin and
Howard, 2006; Cytrynbaum and Marshall, 2007; Loose et al., 2008; Derr
et al., 2009; Borowski and Cytrynbaum, 2009), the possibility that MinE is
transiently attached to the membrane to form the dense E-ring has not been
investigated at single molecule resolution in three-dimensional (3D) space.
Here by accounting for the transient membrane attachment of MinE, we
modeled the MinDE system with Spatiocyte and successfully reproduced
the observed in vivo dynamic localization patterns. Our simulation results

suggest that the transient membrane attachment of MinE leads to the
formation of E-ring.
4.1
modeling the e-ring
To formulate a model of the MinDE system that can reproduce the E-ring,
we looked at the properties of MinE. The domains at the two terminals of
MinE appear to have separate roles in the polar zone oscillations although
they have been found to interact with each other (Ramos et al., 2006).
Firstly, in the absence of the MinE C-terminal domain, E-ring fails to
appear (Raskin and de Boer, 1997). The C-terminal also contains the
homodimerization domain of MinE (King et al., 1999). Hence, effective
homodimerizations of MinE may play a signiﬁcant role in E-ring, especially
since it is made up of dense MinE. Secondly, when E-rings fail to appear,
MinD polar zones extend beyond the midcell and take much longer to
cycle between the poles (Rowland et al., 2000), resulting in the minicelling
phenotype. This implies that the MinD ATPase activity is substantially
reduced (Huang et al., 2003) in the absence of E-ring as a consequence of
the disrupted MinE C-terminal domain. Strikingly, the MinD interaction
domain resides near the MinE N-terminal (Ma et al., 2003), which was
present. Therefore, because the polar zone still appeared, the ATPase
activation function in the MinE N-terminal domain is likely at a very low
basal level when the C-terminal domain is disrupted. Thirdly, the truncated
N-terminal domain, which forms a nascent helix (King et al., 1999), can
autonomously bind to the membrane in the absence of MinD (Ma et al.,
2003), and in the full length MinE, the binding domain is thought to be
exposed upon membrane recruitment by MinD (Ma et al., 2003). This
further supports our theory that MinE constituting the E-ring remained
transiently attached to the membrane independently after recruited by
MinD.

4.1 modeling the e-ring
We make two assumptions to account for the above MinE properties
in our model. First, since MinE cannot independently associate to the
membrane, the putative membrane binding domain near the MinE N-
terminal is only exposed upon binding with MinD on the membrane as
suggested by Ma et al. (2003). Second, we predict that MinE can only begin
to transiently attach to the membrane independently of MinD when it is in
the dimer form with the membrane binding domains at both N-terminals
exposed. This is analogous to MinD, which must be in the dimer form for
stable binding to the membrane (Zhou et al., 2005).
The series of reactions in the proposed model are as follows: (i) cytosolic
MinDATP independently binds to the membrane, but with a very low
afﬁnity,
MinDATP
k1
−→MinDm,
(4.1)
where the superscript m denotes that the molecule is membrane bound;
(ii) MinDm cooperatively recruits cytosolic MinDATP,
MinDm + MinDATP
k2
−→2MinDm;
(4.2)
(iii) MinDm also recruits cytosolic MinE dimer (represented as MinEE) to
the membrane,
MinDm + MinEE
k3
−→MinDEEm;
(4.3)
(iv) in the complex MinDEEm, MinE stimulates MinD ATPase function,
triggering the release of MinD to the cytoplasm whereas MinEE remains
transiently bound to the membrane via its exposed N-terminal membrane
binding domains (Ma et al., 2003)
MinDEEm k4
−→MinDADP + MinEEm;
(4.4)
61
Nature Precedings : doi:10.1038/npre.2010.4201.1 : Posted 5 Feb 2010

(v) the released MinDADP is phosphorylated in the cytoplasm,
MinDADP
k5
−→MinDATP;
(4.5)
(vi) the unbound MinE subunit in the MinDEEm complex can also asso-
ciate with other MinD on the membrane,
MinDm + MinDEEm k6
−→MinDEEDm;
(4.6)
(vii) the MinDEEDm complex releases MinDADP to the cytoplasm upon
activation,
MinDEEDm k7
−→MinDADP + MinDEEm;
(4.7)
and (viii) because of the transient nature of MinEEm membrane associa-
tion, it also dissociates to the cytoplasm
MinEEm k8
−→MinEE.
(4.8)
Note that the ﬁrst ﬁve reactions, (4.1)–(4.5), are similar to the well known
MinDE model by Huang et al. (2003). However, in reaction (4.4) of our
scheme, the MinE dimer is transiently attached to the membrane instead
of immediately becoming cytosolic after activating and releasing MinD.
Table 4.1 summarizes the simulation parameters and their sources. We
used the adapted NR method to execute reactions (4.4), (4.5), (4.7) and
(4.8) since they are diffusion-independent. The remaining reactions were
performed using the proposed method for diffusion-inﬂuenced reactions.

are in agreement with those observed in experiments (Raskin and de Boer,
1999; Shih et al., 2002). Moreover, dense MinEm can be seen clearly local-
izing annularly to form the E-ring at the edge of the polar zones (see also
Figure 4.1C). The average oscillation period for 20 cycles is 48 ± 6 s, which
is consistent with the experimentally measured average value by Shih
et al. (2002). The oscillation period can also be increased to be within the
range of 50 s to 120 s as experimentally determined by Meacci and Kruse
(2005) by reducing the MinE transient membrane dissociation rate, k8. For

the model, 1 minute of simulated time takes approximately 4 minutes of
runtime on an Intel Core 2 Extreme 3.2 GHz system with 8 GB of RAM.
The parameters that we used for the model were obtained from experi-
mental data if available, otherwise they were either ﬁtted or approximated
(see Table 4.1). Signiﬁcantly, compared to the MinD nucleotide exchange
rate used in previous models (Huang et al., 2003; Kerr et al., 2006; Fange
and Elf, 2006), ours was increased by several folds to 5 s−1 to meet the
lower bound determined by Meacci et al. (2006). Furthermore, increasing
or reducing the ﬁtted reaction rates simultaneously by twofold did not
substantially affect the oscillation patterns but changed the average os-
cillation periods to 24 ± 4 s and 116 ± 23 s respectively. It is also possible
to generate the oscillations and E-rings when the changes are larger than
twofold but each ﬁtted reaction rate needed to be readjusted. The initial
positions of the molecules in the cytoplasm or on the membrane also
did not have an effect in establishing and sustaining the oscillations. In
addition, reducing the cell length from 4.5 µm to 3.5 µm or increasing
the length to 5.5 µm still maintained the dynamic localization patterns of
MinD and MinE with the average oscillation periods of 47 ± 6 s and 55 ± 8
s respectively. Taken together, a wide range of parameter values can be
used to reproduce the E-ring and MinDE oscillation dynamics with our
model.
4.2.2
Transient membrane attachment of MinE leads to the formation of E-ring
Figure 4.1C shows that the wild type localization patterns of MinE and
MinD from our simulations are consistent with the in vivo results obtained
by Shih et al. (2002). The simulated E-ring, nonetheless, is more dispersed
than its in vivo counterpart possibly because we did not consider MinE
oligomerization (Pichoff et al., 1995; Zhang et al., 1998) and/or MinD
polymerization (Shih et al., 2003), both of which can substantially reduce
the diffusion coefﬁcient and sharply increase the subunit density at the

localization site. In addition, a signiﬁcant portion of the E-ring is composed
of MinE that is transiently attached to the membrane independent of MinD
(shown in cyan in Figure 4.1A and 4.1C). We conclude that our wild type
model can reproduce the E-ring similar to the observations in vivo.
To conﬁrm that our model can also reproduce the mutant phenotypes
of Escherichia coli, we compared simulation results with in vivo dynamic
localization patterns of MinD and MinE when the C-terminal domain
of MinE is disrupted. As evident in Figure 4.2, our model accurately
reproduced the disappearance of E-ring and the diffusely extended MinD
polar zones observed by Rowland et al. (2000) when we reduced the MinD
ATPase activation rates k4 and k7 to 0.06 s−1. Additionally, the oscillation
also has a very long period of ≈10 minutes, which corresponds to what
has been observed experimentally (Rowland et al., 2000). Our results agree
with previous suggestions by Huang et al. (2003) and Derr et al. (2009)
that the reduction of the ATP hydrolysis rate can increase the period and
reduce the intensity of E-rings. In our model, however, the E-ring is no
longer visible because MinEm is dissociated much faster (k8) than its
effective recruitment rates (arising from k4 and k7). MinE was represented
as homodimers in the model although it likely existed as monomers in vivo
since the C-terminal domain, required for homodimerization, was removed
(Rowland et al., 2000). As a result, we readjusted the model to represent
MinE as monomers, which still reproduced the mutant phenotypes when
the hydrolysis rate was decreased (data not shown).
In both experiment (Shih et al., 2002) and in our simulations, the growing
polar zone appears to be blocked at midcell by the E-ring before shrinking
and subsequently growing again at the opposite pole. The polar zone
grows because of independent nucleation and cooperative recruitment of
MinDATP to the membrane. The shrinkage is the result of MinDm stimula-
tion by the MinE population from the cytoplasm that is recruited to the
membrane. Adding another reaction to the wild type model that allows
MinEm to bind and stimulate MinDm on the membrane did not apprecia-

bly alter the dynamic localization patterns (data not shown). Therefore
in vivo, the transiently attached MinEEm could also be associating with
MinDm directly on the membrane, bypassing the cytosolic phase.
To see if the E-ring is still generated as observed in vivo when MinE
is immediately released to the cytoplasm instead of being transiently at-
tached to the membrane upon ATP hydrolysis, we employed the adapted
Huang et al. (2003) model, comprising only reactions (4.1)–(4.5). MinE was
represented as monomers instead of dimers in the reactions to simplify
the model and as a result, the remaining three reactions (4.6)–(4.8) were
removed. In the adapted reaction (4.4), we replaced the product MinEm
with cytosolic MinE to exclude transient membrane attachments of MinE.
The reaction rates k1 (0.035 µms−1), k2 (0.04 µm3s−1), k3 (0.5 µm3s−1),
k4 (0.15 s−1) and k5 (5 s−1) were ﬁtted to reproduce the pole-to-pole
oscillations. The resulting dynamic localization patterns of MinDE are
shown in Figure 4.1B. The results indicate that MinDEm localized an-
nularly at the edge of polar zones that cycled with an average period
of 71 ± 8 s. Because the simulated MinE was always found dimerized
with MinD on the membrane, the in vivo localization pattern of E-ring,
which is not co-localized with MinD as shown in Figure 4.1C (Shih et al.,
2002), was not reproduced. Hence, we conclude that MinE must be able to
transiently attach to the membrane independently once recruited by MinD
to reproduce the E-ring.

Width of E-ring is proportional to MinD ATPase activation rate
The basic factors that establish and sustain in vivo MinDE oscillations
according to the Huang et al. model have previously been described Huang
et al. (2003). Here we examine the oscillation characteristics in terms of
the adapted reaction (4.4) and the three new reactions (4.6)–(4.8) that we
added to the model to generate the E-ring.
As shown in the previous section, the E-ring is formed as result of
the transient membrane association of MinEEm after MinD is dissociated
68

to the cytoplasm in reactions (4.4) and (4.7). Increasing the rates of ATP
hydrolysis, k4 and k7, widened the E-ring and decreased the oscillation
period. This is expected because more transiently membrane-associated
MinEEm are available to form the E-ring while MinD in the polar zones is
rapidly removed. Conversely, the oscillations become slower with thinner
and fainter E-rings while the polar zones elongated when the rates were
reduced. The fainter E-rings are consistent with the in vivo localization
patterns resulting from a point mutation to the MinE C-terminal domain
(MinED45A) conducted by Shih et al. (2002). Our results thus imply that
the mutation at the C-terminal domain may have impaired the MinD
activation function of MinE.
Increasing the rate of reaction (4.6) narrowed the E-ring by reducing
the subsequent production of transiently bound MinEEm dimers but
decreased the period. The oscillation is rapid because more MinDEEm
associates with MinDm that are eventually activated. In reaction (4.8),
increasing the rate MinEEm is dissociated to the cytoplasm also had a
similar effect in that it narrowed the E-ring and made the oscillation
faster. The burst in the cytosolic MinE population that are capable of
rapidly rebinding with MinDm contributes to the shortening of the period.
Reciprocally, E-rings widen with slower oscillations when the dissociation
rate is reduced. However, if the rate is too small the E-rings become
dispersed as a result of MinEEm lateral diffusion.
Overall, the population of MinDEEm, MinDEEDm and MinEEm are
inversely proportional to the rates k4, k7 and k8 respectively. The ratio
of the three rates with respect to each other also generally determines
the population ratio of the three different MinE species on the membrane.
For example, higher k4 and k7 than k8 will generate less MinDEEm and
MinDEEDm compared to MinEEm.

discussion
In this chapter, we modeled the MinDE dynamics using Spatiocyte to
elucidate the mechanism of E-ring formation, which remains ambiguous.
Based on the high density of MinE in the E-ring that is not co-localized
with MinD at least half of that density (assuming each MinD subunit
recruited a MinE dimer at the E-ring) (Shih et al., 2002), and the ability of
the truncated N-terminal domain of MinE to bind autonomously to the
membrane (Ma et al., 2003), we predicted that the MinE constituting the
E-ring remains transiently bound to the membrane autonomously after
being recruited by MinD. To evaluate our prediction, we incorporated
transient membrane attachments of MinE (MinEm) in our MinDE model.
We reduced the complexity and parameters of the model by incorporat-
ing a small number of reactions that are necessary to reproduce the MinDE
dynamics observed in vivo. Consequently, the reaction and diffusion pa-
rameters are effective parameters that might represent multiple processes
such as oligomerization and polymerization, which are not explicitly rep-
resented. We have also made two assumptions in the model. First, as
suggested by Ma et al. (2003), we assume that the putative membrane
binding domain near the MinE N-terminal is only exposed upon binding
with MinD on the membrane. Second, we speculate that MinE must be in
a dimer form with both N-terminal membrane binding domains exposed
by MinD before it can transiently attach to the membrane independently
of MinD.
With the simpliﬁcation and assumptions, our model reproduced the
MinDE oscillation dynamics and E-ring that are consistent with the obser-
vations in vivo. Using the Spatiocyte visualization method, we can directly
compare the in vivo co-localization patterns of doubly labeled MinD and
MinE (Shih et al., 2002) with simulation. Signiﬁcantly, our results for the
ﬁrst time show that the transient membrane attachment of MinE is nec-
essary to reproduce the E-ring as observed in vivo. As we predicted, a
signiﬁcant portion of the simulated E-ring consisted of transiently mem-

brane attached MinEm. The results also indicate that the width of E-ring
is proportional to the MinD ATPase activation rate and inversely propor-
tional to the membrane detachment rate of MinEm. Higher binding rates
of MinDEEm to MinDm also narrowed the E-ring. When the C-terminal
domain of MinE was removed, the model recovered the in vivo mutant
phenotypes, including the longer polar zones, the substantial delay in the
oscillation period and the loss of E-ring. Our results attribute the mutant
phenotypes to the reduction of MinD ATPase activation by MinE.
We suggest a possible scenario for the reduced ATPase activation rate.
In the mutant, MinE is mostly found in the form of monomers because the
domain responsible for dimerization near the C-terminal region has been
removed. Wild type MinE in the dimer form could activate two MinD
monomers concurrently and thus, it is more effective in activating multiple
MinD protomers at a localized site of an oligomer or a polymer on the
membrane. For example, at the leading edge of the polar zone where the
E-ring forms, it is crucial for MinE to dissociate MinD faster than it is
recruited to the membrane. Otherwise, it would not be possible to rapidly
shrink the polar zone as seen in the wild type cells. Therefore, when
the homodimerization of MinE1−53 is impaired, the effective ATPase
activation rate could be signiﬁcantly reduced, resulting in the mutant
phenotypes.
Interestingly, MinE C-terminal point mutations of the residues Asp45
and Val49 to Ala in MinED45A/V49A also resulted in the minicelling pheno-
type (King et al., 2000; Shih et al., 2002) and the complete loss of E-rings
although MinED45A/V49A homodimerizes in vitro (Shih et al., 2002). The
mutated residues form a highly conserved tetrad at the center of the
MinE dimer interface King et al. (see Figure 4.3A and 2000). Even though
MinED45A/V49A might be in the dimer form in the cytoplasm and in vitro
conditions that are free of membrane and MinD (Shih et al., 2002), we
predict that the dimer could be destabilized and dissociated on the cell
membrane by its N-terminal interactions with dimeric or polymeric MinD

ondary structure of the dimer in Figure 4.3B, the mutated tetrad is located
at the center of solvent exposed face of the alpha helices and might be es-
sential for the dimer stability when it associates with MinD. The proximity

Figure 4.3: The MinED45A/A49A mutant dimer and molecular models
of MinE interactions (cont.). (C) Molecular models of wild type MinE
and MinED45A/A49A interactions in the MinDE system. The models are
represented by MinD (lime green box) that could be a subunit of an
oligomer/polymer (gray box), MinE N-terminal (EN) and C-terminal (EC)
domains, inner membrane (light blue horizontal block), cytoplasm (white
space), membrane binding domain (thick dark blue line), dimerization
bond (thick black line), Asp45 (magenta box) and Val49 (light green box)
dimerization interfaces, dissociation reaction (black arrow) and transition
of reactions (red arrow). (Wild Type MinE)(i) Cytosolic MinE, mostly ex-
isting as dimers, is recruited to the membrane by MinD oligomers. The
membrane binding domain at the N-terminals of the dimer are exposed by
MinD upon recruitment. (ii) The MinE dimer cooperatively and strongly
activates MinD because both of its N-terminal domains are associated
with MinD. Once MinD is released to the cytoplasm, the dimer remains
transiently bound to the membrane via the membrane binding region
at both of its N-terminals. The transiently bound dimer could either dis-
sociate to the cyoplasm (iii) or associate with new MinD protomers (iv).
(v) MinE dimer weakly activates the ATPase function of MinD without
cooperativity when only one of its N-terminals is associated with MinD.
Once activated the dimer becomes cytosolic if the membrane binding
domain is only exposed at one of its N-terminals. Reactions (i), (ii), (iii),
(iv) and (v) are simpliﬁed by the reactions (4.3), (4.6), (4.7), (4.8) and (4.4),
respectively, in our model. (MinED45A/A49A Mutant)(i) In the cyoplasm,
MinED45A/A49A may exist as a homodimer or a monomer. The homodimer
(or two monomers) is recruited to the membrane by MinD oligomers
(or two monomers). The membrane-binding domain at the N-terminal
of MinED45A/A49A is also exposed with the help of MinD. (ii) The re-
cruited MinED45A/A49A dimer is destabilized on the membrane by MinD
and dissociates. (iii) The dissociated MinED45A/A49A monomer activates
its bound MinD monomer weakly since there is no cooperativity. Upon
activation, both MinD and MinED45A/A49A monomers are released into
the cytoplasm. MinED45A/A49A is not transiently bound to the membrane
because it must be in the dimer form with the membrane binding domain
of both monomers exposed to support transient binding. (iv and v) Dur-
ing the long interval to weakly activate MinD, cytosolic MinED45A/A49A
monomer associates with its membrane counterpart and dissociates it
to the cytoplasm. Reaction (i) and reactions (ii-v) are simpliﬁed by the
reactions (4.3) and (4.4), respectively, in our model.

4.3 discussion
of the tetrad to the N-terminal domains indicates that it could be subjected
to immediate stress as MinD is associated at both ends, which could be
further ampliﬁed when MinD forms higher-order complexes. Figure 4.3C
illustrates an example of MinDE interaction model with the destabilization
of MinED45A/V49A dimer by MinD. Additionally, a single point mutation
of Asp45 to Ala in MinED45A was capable of generating narrower E-rings,
which we could attribute to a less destabilized MinED45A dimer interface.
Parallel to the narrowing of the E-ring width when we decreased the
activation rates k4 and k7 in our simulation, some MinED45A that are able
to stay dimerized on the membrane could strongly activate MinD and
form the narrower E-rings.
Since a wide range of our model parameters was able to reproduce the
dynamic localization patterns of MinDE, the model could also approximate
more elaborate models comprising detailed reactions such as MinDE
oligomerization. In Figure 4.3C we illustrate two such detailed models
of wild type MinE and MinED45A/V49A mutant interactions in the MinDE
system. Recently, Derr et al. (2009) proposed a partial non-oscillating
polymerization model of the MinDE system that do not explicitly include
cooperative activation of MinD to reproduce E-rings. Because in the model
MinE is always found dimerized with MinD on the membrane, it cannot
recover E-rings that are much denser than MinD. It will be interesting to
see how polymerization of MinD affects the formation of E-ring when
transient membrane attachment of MinE is incorporated. Since stronger
ATPase activation would be required to fragmentize and depolymerize
annealing MinD polymers than freely diffusing MinD as the case in our
model, we predict denser E-ring would form at the rim of the polar zones
if we extend our model to include MinD polymerization.
By observing E-ring localization patterns in ﬂuorescence microscopy
images, it is difﬁcult to infer what causes such dynamic annular structure
formation. Based on the density of MinE in the E-ring that is much higher
than MinD at the rim of polar zones, we can predict that it could be caused

by transient membrane attachment of MinE. As we showed in this work,
using Spatiocyte to create a model based on the known properties of MinE
and the previously reported wild type and mutant localization patterns
of the MinDE system, we can substantiate our prediction. Moreover, the
model also provided further mechanistic insights about the system, such
as the width of E-ring could be proportional to the rate of MinD activation.

MODELING MEMBRANE-BOUND POLYMERIZATIONS
In the previous chapter, we successfully modeled and reproduced the
E-ring dynamics as observed in vivo. However, the MinDE model was
simpliﬁed and did not include MinD polymerizations on the membrane.
In this chapter, we extend the Spatiocyte method to model polymerization
of proteins.
In addition to the spatial regulation of division site selection by the
MinDE system, many other cellular processes are also regulated by pro-
tein polymers. In eukaryotic cells, cytoskeletal polymers comprising mi-
crotubules, actin and intermediate ﬁlaments participate in processes as
diverse as cytokinesis, directing chromosome segregation, establishing
and maintaining cell morphology, facilitating cell motility and intracel-
lular transport, and deﬁning cell polarity (Moseley and Goode, 2006;
Herrmann et al., 2007; Verhey and Gaertig, 2007). Similar functions are
also performed by bacterial cytoskeletal polymers composed of Walker A
ATPases (Koonin, 1993), and homologs of tubulin, actin and intermediate
ﬁlament (Michie and Löwe, 2006; Shih and Rothﬁeld, 2006; Graumann,
2007; Pogliano, 2008). Moreover, recent research shows that several key
signaling pathways in animal cells are also regulated by polymerizing
proteins (Schwarz-Romond et al., 2007; Harada et al., 2008). Almost all of
these polymers are dynamic, carrying out their functions through care-
fully orchestrated assembly, disassembly and redistribution of polymer
subunits. It is becoming increasingly evident that quantitative models of
polymerization are necessary to understand the collective dynamics of
subunits and interacting molecules (Haviv et al., 2006; Kozlowski et al.,
2007; Schek et al., 2007; Surovtsev et al., 2008; Loose et al., 2008). Poly-
merization models are also used to estimate subunit binding energy and
activation rates (Lan et al., 2008).

modeling membrane-bound polymerizations
Since a polymerization model essentially involves molecular interac-
tions, it should describe at the molecular scale the emergent properties of
protein polymers that support their cellular functions (Karsenti et al., 2006).
These properties include the ability of polymers to assemble cooperatively,
isodesmically or both. In an isodesmic polymer, the effective binding en-
ergy for each subunit is identical and constant, whereas in a cooperative
polymer, the energy is increased by lateral or allosteric interactions. Lat-
eral cooperative assemblies produce multistranded polymers in which one
or more laterally bound subunit concurrently strengthens two or more
longitudinally bound subunits. In allosteric cooperative assemblies, newly
bound subunits undergo conformational changes that increase their bind-
ing afﬁnity for other subunits. The conformational changes may propagate
according to the classical Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) (Monod et al.,
1965) or Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer (KNF) (Koshland et al., 1966) model,
or the recently proposed conformational spread (CS) Bray and Duke (2004)
model. A polymer elongates by recruiting subunits to one or both of its
ends, or in the case of subunit treadmilling (Wegner, 1976), one end of
the polymer recruits while the other dissociates them. At steady state,
a constant polymer length is maintained if the rates of recruitment and
dissociation are the same. When any bond between subunits is broken, the
polymer becomes fragmented. Distinct or fragmented polymers may also
anneal to form a contiguous polymer.
Polymer functions are also linked to its morphology and molecular
interactions in the 3D intracellular space. Protein ﬁlaments conﬁned to
spherical or rod-shaped cell membranes are known to arrange into helical
(Shih et al., 2003), ring (Bi and Lutkenhaus, 1991) and line (Larsen et al.,
2007) structures. In the cytoplasm, subunits can assemble into tubules,
asters and stars (Mejillano et al., 2004; Haviv et al., 2006). Intracellular spa-
tial features that can inﬂuence polymer assembly and function include the
3D position of subunits and polymer nucleation sites (Lutkenhaus, 2007),
volume exclusion by polymer ﬁlaments (Haviv et al., 2006), molecular

crowding (Popp et al., 2007; Wieczorek and Zielenkiewicz, 2008), intercom-
partmental interaction and subcellular localization of reacting molecules
(Lutkenhaus, 2007), and diffusion-inﬂuenced reactions of molecules that
are either small numbered or heterogeneously distributed (Shih et al., 2002;
Lutkenhaus, 2007). Diffusion and small numbers of reacting molecules
may also induce stochasticity (Rao et al., 2002; Bhalla, 2004; Wilkinson,
2009) in polymer assembly (VanBuren et al., 2002).
Although a variety of quantitative methods have been developed to
model protein polymerization dynamics (Haviv et al., 2006; Kozlowski
et al., 2007; Schek et al., 2007; Surovtsev et al., 2008; Loose et al., 2008;
Cytrynbaum and Marshall, 2007; Lan et al., 2008; Miraldi et al., 2008),
many of the properties above have been omitted primarily because of the
computational cost and complexity. In this chapter, we extend Spatiocyte
to model polymerization of proteins and show that it can incorporate
the above properties while still maintaining a reasonable computational
time. We focus on polymers that are constrained to surfaces such as the
cell membrane, although our method can be adapted to model cytosolic
polymerizations as well.
5.1
methods
To model polymerization of proteins we adopt several typical approxi-
mations in polymer models: (i) we assume that the modeled polymers
are immobile and have attained their low energy morphology on the
membrane; (ii) we focus on polymerizations that are free of explicit force
generation and are constrained to a surface compartment; (iii) for a frag-
menting polymer species, we assume that any longitudinal bond between
two protomers in the polymer can break with the same rate constant; (iv)
conversely for an annealing polymer species, protomers at the tip of two
polymers can associate to form one longer polymer with the same rate,
78
Nature Precedings : doi:10.1038/npre.2010.4201.1 : Posted 5 Feb 2010

5.1 methods
regardless of the length of the original polymers; and (v) we assume that
the multistranded polymers form 2D sheets over a surface compartment
instead of 3D sheets.
In our polymerizing Spatiocyte method, a polymer is nucleated when
two free monomers come into contact and associate to form an immo-
bile dimer on the membrane. If at least one of the free monomers is
a diffusing species, the monomer association is performed using the
diffusion-inﬂuenced reaction approach described in Chapter 2, otherwise,
the adapted NR method is applied (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3). Each
monomer of the dimer, which is in contact with the other, still occupies its
respective voxel and is now immobile. The dimer now constitutes the two
nucleated protomers at the tips of the nascent polymer. With a given reac-
tion rate, the protomers can each recruit another monomer longitudinally
when they come into contact. As this procedure is performed repetitively,
the polymer elongates by the two opposite tips to form a single stranded
polymer. The polymer can be fragmented when two protomers of the poly-
mer is dissociated. The protomers at the tip can also dissociate and become
a free monomer with a given rate. All dissociation reactions are performed
using the adapted NR method. Two distinct polymers can anneal when
the protomers at their tips come into contact and associate. The association
reaction is executed using the adapted NR method because both protomers
are immobile and are in contact (see Chapter 2, Section 2.3). Thus, when a
protomer is in contact with another immobile protomer that is a reactant
pair, the reaction is arranged in the adapted NR method priority queue
for execution according to the reaction propensity. A polymer can also
become multistranded when the protomers recruit monomers laterally.
The overall geometry of a polymer is determined by the bends between
each of its protomers. To constrain the polymer to the surface of a sphere
or a cylinder, the typical shapes of cellular or nuclear membrane, we adopt
the procedure proposed by Andrews and Arkin (2007). The procedure
maps the relative turn (α) of a recruited protomer to the left or right of the
79

recruiting protomer on a ﬂat plane to the corresponding 3D yaw (φ), pitch
(θ) and roll (ψ) angles for either the cylindrical or spherical membrane
surface. It ensures that the two protomers are touching the curved surface
and are plane-parallel to the surface below the center of the protomers.
Yaw speciﬁes the turn to the left or right of the recruiting protomer while
rotating tangent to the membrane surface, pitch indicates the rotation
angle up or down the recruiting protomer’s frame of reference, whereas
roll speciﬁes the rotation around the polymer axis.
It is worth noting that the Andrews and Arkin procedure constrains
polymers to surfaces without molecular reaction or diffusion. Moreover,
the procedure was developed to constrain polymers in continuous space,
unlike in the Spatiocyte method where the space is discretized into HCP
lattice. As a result, we map the continuum 3D coordinates to the lipid
voxel nearest to the target coordinates and occupy it with the recruited
protomer. To prevent the accumulation of error when mapping subsequent
recruited protomers from continuum to discrete space, the method keeps
a copy of the initial continuum coordinates when the polymer is nucleated
and uses them as the reference coordinates for subsequent recruitments.
We have also added connective protomers to ensure that all protomers
within a polymer is contiguous because the continuous to discrete space
mapping may sometimes result in disjointed protomers.

polymerization molecules with various geometries.
5.3
discussion
In this chapter, we have extended the Spatiocyte method to model membrane-
bound polymerization of molecules. Our aim is to introduce a simple ap-
proach to represent the typical forms of membrane-bound polymerization.
The method models polymerization by making several approximations as
indicated in Section 5. Our results show that various polymer geometries
on the membrane can be modeled by Spatiocyte. An advantage of the
method is that the rate of protomer reaction or dissociation is dependent
on its position, as it is the case in vivo and in vitro. For example, the frag-
mentation rate in the middle of the polymer is lower than the dissociation
of the tip protomer, even if all protomers have the same dissociation con-
stant. This is because dissociated protomers at the middle of the polymer
have a higher chance of rebinding due to their proximity. Therefore, we

do not need to create reactions as a function of the polymer length as it is
done by other polymerization approaches (Lan et al., 2008). The method
can in future be used to model the polymerization dynamics of MinD,
which forms a helical structure on the Escherichia coli membrane during
the polar zone oscillations.

CONCLUSIONS AN D FUTURE DIRECTIONS
In this work, we developed a new lattice-based Monte Carlo method
called Spatiocyte that can perform RD in and between volume and surface
compartments at single molecule resolution. Stochasticity in RD and the
excluded volume effect brought by intracellular molecular crowding, both
of which can signiﬁcantly affect RD and thus, cellular processes, are also
supported by Spatiocyte. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst method that
supports multicompartmental RD, stochasticity and the implications of
molecular crowding simultaneously. We have veriﬁed the correctness of
Spatiocyte by comparing the simulation results of diffusion, irreversible
and reversible reactions with the outcomes from analytical and numeri-
cal solutions. Spatiocyte also reproduces the well known implications of
molecular crowding in volume and surface compartments. To reduce the
high computational cost associated with spatial modeling methods, it em-
ploys several optimization strategies. First, it can simultaneously simulate
HD species, usually found in high concentrations, at compartmental scale
and low copy species, often heterogeneously distributed, at molecular
scale. As a result, the diffusion of each molecule belonging to the highly
concentrated species, which would incur very high computational cost,
can be skipped. Second, to allow bigger jumps in the simulation time, reac-
tions involving HD species are executed in an event-driven manner. Third,
the simulation space is discretized into hexagonal close-packed lattice to
allow fast resolving of molecular collisions, thus supporting rapid RD
simulation in crowded compartments. The optimization of computations
in Spatiocyte proved to be very efﬁcient since it only requires 4 minutes
for a desktop computer to simulate 1 minute of the MinDE system that
can reproduce the E-ring.

conclusions and future directions
We also devised a new visualization method that uses the temporal posi-
tional data of simulated molecules to simulate optical microscopy images
of ﬂuorescent labeled proteins. This is done by displaying the trajectory
of simulated molecules averaged according to the camera exposure time
used in the microphotography process. With the method we were able
to directly compare our simulation results to the localization patterns of
MinD and MinE in Escherichia coli and make objective evaluations.
We implemented Spatiocyte using the E-Cell System, an advanced
open-source simulation platform to model and analyze both small- and
large-scale biochemical reaction networks. The driver algorithm of the
E-Cell System (version 3) supports concurrent executions of multiple
simulation algorithms, whose time steps are independently advanced
in continuous-time, discrete-time or discrete-event manner at varying
timescales. Simulation algorithms can be developed using C++ and incor-
porated into the system as plug in modules. By creating three basic types
of algorithm modules, comprising a discrete-event simulation stepper,
reaction and diffusion processes, we were able to successfully implement
Spatiocyte using the E-Cell System. The correctness of the implementation
was demonstrated by the accurate reproduction of the MinDE oscillation
behaviors in Escherichia coli, as observed in both experimental and previous
computational studies.
Using the Spatiocyte implementation we modeled the Escherichia coli
MinDE division site selection system and investigated the mechanism
of MinE ring formation. By observing the E-ring localization pattern in
ﬂuorescence microscopy images, it is difﬁcult to determine what causes
such dynamic annular formation. Based on the density of MinE in the E-
ring that is much higher than MinD at the rim of polar zones, we predicted
that it could be caused by transient membrane attachment of MinE after
being recruited to the membrane by MinD. As we showed in this work,
using Spatiocyte to create a model based on the known properties of MinE
and the previously reported wild type and mutant localization patterns of

conclusions and future directions
the MinDE system, we could substantiate our prediction. Moreover, the
model also provided further mechanistic insights about the system, such
as the width of E-ring could be proportional to the rate of MinD activation.
Recent experimental studies have shown that MinD forms helical poly-
mers on the membrane (Shih et al., 2003). We have extended Spatiocyte
to model such membrane-bound polymerization dynamics of molecules
although it has not been used to model the MinD polymerization dynam-
ics. In future, in addition to modeling the polymerization dynamics in the
MinDE system, Spatiocyte could also be used to elucidate the formation
of the division septum at the middle of Escherichia coli (Lutkenhaus, 2007;
Adams and Errington, 2009) since the process also involves multicompart-
mental RD and polymerizations. Importantly, the FtsZ protein forms a
complex polymer structure that constricts in the middle of the cell to pro-
duce the two daughter cells. To model the constriction however, Spatiocyte
needs to account for the force-generation by the FtsZ polymers. Other
cellular processes that are strongly dependent on the cell morphology,
multicompartmental interaction and dynamic localization of molecules,
such as cellular signaling (Rangamani and Iyengar, 2008) and bacterial
chemotaxis (Greenﬁeld et al., 2009; Rao and Ordal, 2009), could also be
modeled in future using Spatiocyte. As the work in this thesis demon-
strates, such models may provide mechanistic insights that are difﬁcult to
