Unitary Operator
Werner Stulpe
Unitary operator, a sharpening of the concept of an isometric operator. A linear
 operator J deﬁned on a complex (real) Banach space X ( Hilbert space) with
values in some complex (real) Banach space Y is called isometric or an isometry
if it preserves the norm, i.e., ∥Jφ∥= ∥φ∥for all φ ∈X. An isometric operator
is bounded ( operator) with norm ∥J∥= 1, invertible, and the range RJ is a
closed ( Hilbert space) submanifold of Y which is, even in the case Y = X, in
general smaller than Y (if X and Y have the same ﬁnite dimension, then RJ = Y).
The inverse operator J −1 is an isometry with domain DJ −1 = RJ and the range
RJ −1 = X. Two Banach spaces X and Y are called (norm-) isomorphic if there
exists an isometry from X to Y such that RJ = Y.
An isometric operator J deﬁned on a complex (real) Hilbert space H with values
in some complex (real) Hilbert space K automatically preserves the scalar products
also, i.e., ⟨Jφ|Jψ⟩= ⟨φ|ψ⟩for φ, ψ ∈H. Such an operator is called unitary [1–6]
if H and K are complex Hilbert spaces and if its range is K. That is, a linear operator
U from some complex Hilbert space H to some other complex Hilbert space K is
unitary if (i) DU = H, (ii) ⟨Uφ|Uψ⟩= ⟨φ|ψ⟩for φ, ψ ∈H, and (iii) RU = K.
The inverse U−1 is also unitary where, in the case of H = K, U−1 = U∗holds (the
assumption H = K is not necessary, but corresponds to the deﬁnition of the adjoint
operator given in the section  operator).
The following example shows that an isometric operator acting in a complex
Hilbert space is in general not unitary. Let φ1, φ2, . . . be a complete orthonormal
system of an inﬁnite-dimensional separable  Hilbert space H. For every vector
ψ ∈H, ψ = ∞
i=1 αiφi, ∞
i=1 |αi|2<∞, deﬁne Jψ = ∞
i=1 αiφ2i; J is isometric
since ∥Jψ∥2 = ∞
i=1 |αi|2 = ∥ψ∥2, but J is not unitary since RJ ̸= H. In particu-
lar, the Hilbert space H is isomorphic to the subspace (closed submanifold) spanned
by φ2, φ4, . . .. An important example of a unitary operator is the Fourier transform
in the Hilbert space L2(R, dx) of the square-integrable functions on R. For func-
tions φ ∈L2(R, dx) that are also integrable (i.e., for φ ∈L2(R, dx) ∩L1(R, dx)),
one can deﬁne the Fourier transform ˜φ of φ by ˜φ(k) =

Unitary Operator
Fourier transform F by Fφ = ˜φ. Since ˜φ ∈L2(R, dx) and F is a densely deﬁned,
norm-preserving linear operator, F can uniquely be extended to an isometry deﬁned
on L2(R, dx) with values in L2(R, dx); moreover, since the range of this isometry is
L2(R, dx), F becomes a unitary operator (Fourier–Planchereltheorem). The preser-
vation of the scalar product reads explicitly

R φ(x)ψ(x) dx =

R ˜φ(k) ˜ψ(k) dk
where φ, ψ ∈L2(R, dx).
The (pure) states and  observables of a sort of quantum systems are traditionally
described by the unit vectors of a Hilbert space H and by the self-adjoint operators A
acting in H, respectively. Given a unitary operator U from H to some other Hilbert
space K, the state vectors ψ ∈H, ∥ψ∥= 1, can be transformed according to ψ′ =
Uψ and the observables according to A′ = UAU−1. Under this transformation, the
physically meaningful expectation values remain invariant: ⟨ψ′|A′ψ′⟩= ⟨ψ|Aψ⟩.
The representation of the states and observables by unit vectors and self-adjoint
operators in H is unitarily equivalent to the representation by vectors and operators
in K. This is applied in the context of representations of quantum mechanics (e.g.,
conﬁguration-space or momentum-space representation, matrix representations) as
well as in the context of pictures of quantum dynamics (Schr¨odinger, Heisenberg,
and interaction picture).
Given a  self-adjoint operator A in H with spectral measure E, for each t ∈R
a unitary operator eitA is deﬁned by ⟨ψ|eitAψ⟩= 
R eitλ⟨ψ|E(dλ)ψ⟩, ψ ∈H. The
family of the unitary operators Ut = eitA, t ∈R, satisﬁes (i) U0 = I, (ii) Us+t =
UtUs = UsUt for all s, t ∈R, and (iii) ∥Utφ −φ∥→0 for all φ ∈H as t →0.
A family of unitary operators Ut with t ∈R and the properties (i)–(iii) is called a
strongly continuous one-parameter group of unitary operators. To each such one-
parameter group there exists a uniquely determined self-adjoint operator A such
that Ut = eitA (Stone’s theorem). Thus, there is a one-one correspondence between
the self-adjoint operators A in H and the strongly continuous one-parameter groups
of unitary operators Ut; A is called the inﬁnitesimal generator of Ut, t ∈R. The

continuous and d

The energy observable of a sort of quantum systems is described by its  Hamil-
tonian operator H. The self-adjoint operator H also determines the time develop-
ment of the states; in fact, −1
ℏH is the generator of the time translations, i.e., every
state ψ0 ∈H, ∥ψ0∥= 1, at time t = 0 determines the state at any time t ∈R
according to ψt = e−i
ℏHtψ0. If ψ0 ∈DH , then ψt ∈DH for all t ∈R, and ψt
satisﬁes iℏ˙ψt = Hψt; the latter ordinary differential equation in Hilbert space is the
abstract version of  Schr¨odinger’s equation.
In quantum mechanics, symmetry transformations ( symmetry) are also repre-
sented by unitary operators. For instance, in the Hilbert space L2(R, dx) ( Hilbert

space) of  wave function of particles moving in one spatial direction, a unitary
operator Ua is deﬁned by (Uaψ)(x) = ψ(x −a) where ψ ∈L2(R, dx) and a ∈R;
Ua describes the translation of the states ψ, ∥ψ∥= 1, by a. The strongly con-
tinuous one-parameter group {Ua}a∈R has the inﬁnitesimal generator −P = i d
dx ,
the differential operator P ( self-adjoint operator) is, up to the factor ℏ, the mo-
mentum operator in the one-dimensional conﬁguration-space representation. In this
representation the multiplication operator Q ( self-adjoint operator) is the position
operator, and 1
ℏQ is the inﬁnitesimal generator of a one-parameter group {Ub}b∈R of
unitary operators; Ub describes the boost of the momentum of the states by b. In the
Hilbert space L2(R3, dx) of  wave function on three-dimensional conﬁguration
space, a spatial rotation of the states is described by the unitary operator deﬁned by
(URψ)(x) = ψ(R−1x) where R is a rotation of R3 and ψ ∈L2(R3, dx). The fam-
ily {UR}R∈SO(3) is a unitary representation of the rotation group SO(3). Euclidean
transformations which associate every x ∈R3 with Rx + a, a ∈R3, give rise to the
unitary operators UR,a deﬁned by (UR,aψ)(x) = ψ(R−1(x −a)).
The action of a unitary operator U can, since U is bounded, represented in
matrix form ( operator). As a consequence of U−1 = U∗, the matrix elements
uij = ⟨φi|Uφj⟩, φ1, φ2, . . . being a complete orthonormal system in H, satisfy

j uijukj = δik as well as 
j ujiujk = δik; i.e., the matrix elements constitute a
unitary matrix.
In the context of Hilbert spaces, partial isometries are sometimes of interest.
Given two Hilbert spaces H and K, a partial isometry from H to K is a linear
operator J from H to K such that (i) DJ = H, (ii) ∥Jφ∥= ∥φ∥for all φ belonging
to some subspace X of H, and (iii) Jφ = 0 for all φ ∈X ⊥. So H = X ⊕X ⊥,
K = RJ ⊕R⊥
J , ψ = φ + χ where ψ ∈H, φ ∈X, and χ ∈X ⊥; Jψ = Jφ, J
acts as an isometry on X and as a unitary operator between X and RJ (note that, as
a closed submanifold, RJ itself is a Hilbert space).
