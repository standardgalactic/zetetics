Abstract.
The collapse of a quantum state can be understood as a mathematical
way to construct a joint probability density even for operators that do not commute.
We can formalize that construction as a non-commutative, non-associative collapse
product that is nonlinear in its left operand as a model for joint measurements at time-
like separation, in part inspired by the sequential product for positive semi-deﬁnite
operators.
The familiar collapse picture, in which a quantum state collapses after
each measurement as a way to construct a joint probability density for consecutive
measurements, is equivalent to a no-collapse picture in which L¨uders transformers
applied to subsequent measurements construct a Quantum-Mechanics–Free-Subsystem
of Quantum Non-Demolition operators, not as a dynamical process but as an
alternative mathematical model for the same consecutive measurements.
The no-
collapse picture is particularly simpler when we apply signal analysis to millions or
billions of consecutive measurements.

The collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction

1. Introduction
We can model measurement results in multiple ways because of the near duality between
states and measurement operators.
Most simply, the Schr¨odinger, Interaction, and
Heisenberg “pictures” diﬀer by the actions of unitary operators on the state and on
measurement operators, but give the same expected measurement results. We can take
the idea of diﬀerent pictures signiﬁcantly further by taking collapse of the quantum state,
viewed as a L¨uders transformer[1, §II.3.1], instead to apply to subsequent measurement
operators, so that the state in such a picture does not have to change. It will be shown
here that there are many diﬀerent such pictures, corresponding to diﬀerent orderings of
nonunitary transformers, and that there are several that are relatively natural, not just
one.
It has generally been understood that “collapse of the wave function”, which we will
here call collapse of the state, is particularly a feature of quantum mechanics, however as
a mathematical tool that allows the construction of joint probability densities even when
using noncommutative operators it can be useful in any formalism that uses operators
as models for measurement.
The measurement problem can be understood rather
diﬀerently if we take collapse to be a mathematical construction of joint probability
densities and joint measurements instead of as a nonunitary physical process or speciﬁc
to quantum mechanics (see Fig.
1).
As pointed out in “An algebraic approach to
Koopman classical mechanics”[2], algebraic modeling of measurements and their results,
including the use of noncommutativity, can be used in classical mechanics and in signal
analysis in the presence of thermal or other noise as eﬀectively as it is in quantum
mechanics in the presence of a Poincar´e invariant quantum noise: for a nontrivial

The construction of a joint probability can be understood to use
measurements A and B to construct a joint measurement, A-collapse-B (shown in
the ﬁgure as the noncommutative and nonassociative collapse product, A▶◦B), instead
of A collapsing an initial quantum state to a new quantum state that is measured
by B. With another measurement C we can use either (A-collapse-B)-collapse-C or
A-collapse-(B-collapse-C), a choice between signiﬁcantly diﬀerent alternatives that is
forced on us by nonassociativity and that has to be made repeatedly when we consider
sequences of many measurements. That there is such a choice and that it has to be
made, explicitly or implicitly, because measurements are very often joint measurements
even though they may be modeled by noncommutative operators, has been somewhat
hidden by conventions that are associated with diﬀerent interpretations of quantum
mechanics. Understanding collapse of a quantum state as a way to construct joint
probabilities and joint measurements gives us a largely mathematical path to rethinking
the measurement problem.

classical dynamics, for example, a Liouville state is in general not an eigenstate both
of position measurement and of the Liouvillian operator that generates that classical
dynamics. Even before Koopman’s 1931 introduction of a Hilbert space formalism for
classical mechanics[3], Eckart introduced an algebraic approach to classical mechanics
in 1926[4]; classical and quantum measurement theory and Wigner function methods
can be usefully brought together in such operator and Hilbert space approaches[5, 6, 7].
For recent reviews of the measurement problem, see, for example, [8, Ch. 11] and [9,
particularly §2 and §§10-13]. Both these reviews can be taken to emphasize that classical
measurement theory is incomplete, as here, almost lamenting that incompleteness,
“The right approach, then, must be to deﬁne measurement as in the Copenhagen
Interpretation, i.e. using a classical description of the apparatus whilst realizing it
is ontologically a quantum system”[8, p. 451]
which is echoed by a more historical comment that implies that a quantum apparatus
is not classical and cannot be classically described,
“In the early days of quantum mechanics, the apparatus was supposed to behave
classically, escaping the realm of quantum theory.”[9, p. 15]
The implication that classical measurement theory is incomplete is pervasive in the
literature, as here,
“As a reaction to the unsolved quantum measurement problem, there is a widespread
view that at least part of the macroscopic aspects of an apparatus must be described
in terms of classical physics.”[10, p. 225]
The idea that classical measurement theory should be completed to make it more like
quantum measurement theory, by introducing what we might call Hidden Observables,
is the opposite of a traditional idea that quantum theory should be completed to make
it more classical, by introducing Hidden Variables, with the problem with the latter
being expressed, for example, by Max Jammer,
“as long as observation and experiment enforce upon us the present formalism
of quantum mechanics, it is logically impossible to complete this formalism to a
deterministic description of physical processes”[11, p. 369] (but see also the extensive
footnote 16 on that page.)
A quantum measurement theory that uses a state and a noncommutative algebra of
operators can model the results of experimental procedures and of the algorithms
applied to them that cannot be modeled by a traditional classical measurement theory,
which uses a state and only a commutative algebra of operators.
We can ensure
that classical measurement theory is as complete, however, so we do not have to say
that a system is ontologically or by description classical or quantum, by using the
noncommutative algebra of operators that is provided naturally by the Poisson bracket
within Koopman’s Hilbert space formalism for classical mechanics. We will see that
a classical noncommutative measurement theory does not have quite as much of a

measurement problem because in principle it uses a commutative algebra of operators as
a model for joint measurements, however it can use noncommutativity when necessary.
We can and should introduce more detailed models of experimental apparatus, for
which we can take decoherence[12] or quantum Darwinism[13] to be examples of general
approaches, however we can take the probability measures that are generated by a
quantum state and measurement operators to give us idealized models for statistics, as
we do for classical probability, without necessarily knowing anything of the more detailed
dynamics, as outlined in Appendix A. We particularly do not need to know the detailed
thermodynamics of a macroscopic measurement instrument precisely, or of a number
of measurement instruments integrated into a whole apparatus, for us to compute
relative frequencies from the recorded times of thermodynamic transition events and
to construct probability models or —when measurements are mutually incompatible—
noncommutative probability models for those relative frequencies.
§2 establishes notation and describes the mathematics of collapse of the quantum
state in a form close to what commonly appears in the literature, then §3 proposes
an algebraic approach using the sequential product[15, 16] to construct what will be
called here a collapse product and §4 exhibits various equivalences of several diﬀerent
collapse+noncommutativity and no-collapse+commutativity approaches to modeling
the same joint measurements. Adopting a no-collapse+commutativity picture is close
to the idea of a Quantum-Mechanics–Free-Subsystem introduced by Tsang&Caves[17],
is somewhat preﬁgured by Belavkin[18], and the signal analysis aspect is approached
by Anastopoulos[19], however the use of the sequential product can be understood to
put such ideas in a diﬀerent light.
Adopting a no-collapse+commutativity picture
also suggests an alternative approach to the quantum-classical transition[12, 13,
20, 21], insofar as a system can be completely described within either classical or
quantum mechanics —using whichever is more convenient, as always when we discuss
diﬀerent pictures— provided we include the use of noncommutativity and measurement
incompatibility in the classical formalism (an extension of the measurement theory
of Classical Mechanics that is termed ‘CM+’ in [2]).
The summary idea suggested
here for the various mathematical models is intentionally rather empiricist, taking the
actually recorded data as a ﬁrst foundation, with data and signal analysis leading to
many representations of an algebra of measurements together with a quantum state,
as described in §5.
Although at two extremes we might say that measurements
have underlying hidden causes or that the measurement results are “spooky”, we
can instead commit ourselves to performing new, ﬁner-grained measurements that
investigate the subtleties of the circumstances of our previous measurements.
The
discussion in §5.1 points out that in classical mechanics and signal analysis as well
as in quantum mechanics some measurement results are not commeasurable, so that
a joint probability density that has the required marginal probability densities cannot
always be constructed, which was an already known case in the 19th Century, and it is
helpful to use noncommutative operators without using the mathematics of collapse to
model such cases.

2. Notation and collapse of a quantum state
Linear operators are used in quantum mechanics as models for measurement, with the
set of eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator ˆA corresponding to the sample space of
measurement results, together with a state ρ that models the average results of past
measurements or that ﬁxes what we expect the average results of future measurements
will be, which we can write as the expression ρ( ˆA). For the algebraic conditions satisﬁed
by a state in a quantum mechanical setting, see Appendix B and [22, §III.2.2][23,
§3.2.1.3]; for accounts of the algebraic approach to quantum mechanics, see [23, Ch.
3] and [24, 25, 26, 27, 2]. When it is possible to introduce a trace map and a density
operator, we can write the state as ρ( ˆA) = Tr[ˆρ ˆA]. Three types of account may be found
below: using vector states in an elementary textbook approach, in Appendix C; using
an algebraic formalism, in this section; and using Positive Operator-Valued Measures
(POVMs), in §3.1.
In general, sample spaces associated with actually recorded measurement results for
real experiments can always be taken to be discrete sets, because each actual record is
always encoded in a ﬁnite number of bits. If we introduce an idealized operator ˆA that
has a continuous sample space, we can discretize it using the Heaviside function, so that,
as a very coarse-grained example, the operator ˆAd = Θ( ˆA −1) + Θ( ˆA −2) + Θ( ˆA −3)
has the sample space {0, 1, 2, 3}, corresponding, perhaps, to an actual two bit record.
Much of the literature on the measurement problem restricts itself to the ﬁnite sample
space case.
§3.1, however, brieﬂy suggests one approach to working with idealized
measurements that have a continuous sample space.
We take a self-adjoint Moment Generating Operator
ˆA† = ˆA to have a discrete
sample space {αi}, so it can be written in a projection-valued presentation as a weighted
sum of a complete set of mutually orthogonal projection operators ˆA = P
i αi ˆP (A)
i
, where
ˆP (A)
i
ˆP (A)
j
= δi,j ˆP (A)
i
and P
i ˆP (A)
i
= ˆ1 [1, Ch. II][26], so that ˆAn = P
i αn
i ˆP (A)
i
. From
this, we can introduce an abstract complex structure j so that we can construct a 1-
parameter group of unitary operators, which we will call here a Characteristic Function
Generating Operator,

to which we can apply an inverse Fourier transformation to construct a normalized

which is a Dirac delta-function form of a Projection-Valued Measure. As pointed out by
Cohen[28], characteristic functions are a natural way to work with probability densities
in a Hilbert space setting. In such a setting, one way to introduce the abstract complex
structure j, as above, pragmatically and following the engineering convention, is as an
eﬀective way to manage the “sine” and “cosine” components of the Fourier transform of a

probability density. The consistent use of j below is intended as something of a reminder
that the ﬁrst place in this algebraic approach where it is natural to introduce an abstract
complex structure is speciﬁcally associated with characteristic functions, however a
complex structure could be introduced for other reasons in a diﬀerent presentation.
With these constructions, a state generates moments, a probability density, and a
characteristic function

(5)
for which the probability density is nonzero only for values in the sample space of the
measurement.
When two operators commute, which they always do when they are models for
measurements that are space-like separated from each other, we can construct a joint
probability density straightforwardly, using the ordinary multiplication, as
p(u, v) = ρ(δ( ˆA−u) · δ( ˆB−v)) =
X
i,j
δ(u −αi)δ(v −βj)ρ( ˆP (A)
i
ˆP (B)
j
),
(6)
where ˆB = P
j βj ˆP (B)
j
, which extends to any number of commuting operators.
For
quantum mechanics, however, operators in general will not commute when they are
models for measurements that are time-like separated from each other, in which case
ˆP (A)
i
ˆP (B)
j
may not be a positive operator and we have to use a diﬀerent construction
as a model for the results of sequential measurements, even though they are joint
measurements that we can model using joint probability densities.
Following a
measurement result αi, we say that the state ρ “collapses” to the state
ρi( ˆX) = ρ( ˆP (A)
i
ˆX ˆP (A)
i
)
ρ( ˆP (A)
i
)
,
(7)
giving the expected value for any operator ˆX, using the L¨uders operation corresponding
to the i’th eigenvalue[1, §II.3.1]. ρi satisﬁes the four conditions required for it to be
a state (as noted above, see Appendix B). The operation ρ 7→ρi may also be called
a state reduction or a state preparation. For a measurement modeled by an operator
ˆB the Probability Density Generating Operator δ( ˆB−v) in the state ρi then gives a
conditional probability density ρi(δ( ˆB−v)). The joint measurement probability density
after the whole process of a ﬁrst measurement, collapse of the state, and a second
measurement is therefore given by the probability density for the ﬁrst measurement and
the probability densities for the second measurement conditional on the result of the
ﬁrst measurement,
pA,collapse,B(u, v) =
X

δ(u −αi)ρ( ˆP (A)

(9)
The sample space {(αi, βj)} of this joint measurement is notably the same as the
sample space associated with two commuting operators with sample spaces {αi}, {βj}.
pA,collapse,B(u, v) is positive semi-deﬁnite by construction and is normalized, as it must
be,
R
pA,collapse,B(u, v)dvdu = 1. See Appendix C for an equivalent derivation that follows
a more textbook approach.
3. A collapse product of probability density and characteristic function
generating operators
Given the construction above, it is quite natural to use the sequential product for positive
semi-deﬁnite operators that is described by Gudder&Greechie[15], ˆX◦ˆY =
p
ˆX· ˆY ·
p
ˆX.
For a number of recent articles about the sequential product by Gudder, see [16]. We
can deﬁne for the discrete sample space case a collapse product of two probability density
generating operators or characteristic function generating operators as
δ( ˆA−u)▶◦δ( ˆB−v) .=
X
i
δ(u −αi) ˆP (A)

i,j
e j(λαi+µβj) ˆP (A)
i
◦ˆP (B)

(11)
(where for projection operators we have
p
ˆP = ˆP), so we can write
pA,collapse,B(u, v) = ρ(δ( ˆA−u)▶◦δ( ˆB−v)),
(12)
and we can deﬁne the reverse case, δ( ˆA−u)◦◀δ( ˆB−v) .= δ( ˆB−v)▶◦δ( ˆA−u). We can think
of this construction as applying a collapse or L¨uders operation to other measurements
instead of to the state, following Bohr’s preference for measurements aﬀecting other
measurements instead of collapse of the state[29]. We can conﬁrm that δ( ˆA−u)▶◦δ( ˆB−v)
is a positive semi-deﬁnite operator and that it is normalized appropriately to generate a
joint probability density in any state,
R
δ( ˆA−u)▶◦δ( ˆB−v)dudv = ˆ1. If [ ˆA, ˆB] = 0, then
[ ˆP (A)
i
, ˆB] = 0, so in that case δ( ˆA−u)▶◦δ( ˆB−v) = δ( ˆA−u) · δ( ˆB−v).
We use the sequential product, in particular, so that we can straightforwardly
generalize the collapse product (though we should note that the square root of a positive
semi-deﬁnite operator is only unique if we insist it is positive semi-deﬁnite), for example
to three or more characteristic function generating operators, as

where we have to include brackets because the collapse product and the sequential
product are nonassociative as well as noncommutative.
Furthermore, the collapse
product is nonlinear in its left-hand argument and the construction

are positive semi-deﬁnite operators and are
normalized appropriately to generate a probability density in any state.
Note that

is well-deﬁned because ˆP (A)

is a positive semi-deﬁnite operator,
but neither operator is a projection unless it happens that [ ˆP (A)

, ˆP (B)

] = 0 for the
particular eigenspaces.
Most commonly, the time ordering of measurements is taken to determine the
ordering of collapse products, however, as a mathematical construction, the ordering
of collapse products is independent of the time ordering of measurement operators, so
that we could perfectly well use the collapse product out of time order if we were to ﬁnd
it useful to do so. Furthermore, time ordering is only a partial ordering for measurements
that are associated with overlapping time intervals, in which case time ordering cannot
by itself determine the ordering of collapse products, so that the collapse product may
introduce some diﬃcult decisions.
Whereas time reversal is straightforward for no-
collapse+commutativity models, time reversal for collapse+noncommutativity models
in which time-order determines collapse order introduces signiﬁcant complications.
We can loosely consider the collapse product to be a regularized form of the positive
semi-deﬁnite but unnormalized construction
δ( ˆA −u)δ( ˆB −v)δ( ˆA −u) =

(17)
where the regularization (the equality up to an inﬁnite normalization that is indicated
by
N=) replaces the improper expression δ(u −αi)δ(u −αk) by δ(u −αi)δi,k.
We
can understand both δ( ˆA−u)▶◦and e jλ ˆ

a parameterized set of operations in their Kraus representation[10, §7.4].

3.1. POVMs and continuous sample spaces
For a σ-algebra F, a collection of subsets of a nonempty set Ωthat is closed under the
set complement X 7→Ω\X and under countable unions and countable intersections, a
Normalized Positive Operator-Valued Measure[1, §II.1.2] is an indexed set of operators
ˆE(X), with X ∈F, for which ˆE(X) is:
(i) Positive semi-deﬁnite: ˆE(X) ≥0 for all X ∈F;
(ii) Normalized: ˆE(Ω) = ˆ1;
(iii) a Measure: ˆE(∪Xi) = P ˆE(Xi) for all disjoint sequences (Xi) ⊂F.
ˆE(X) is deﬁned so that the action of a state gives a probability measure ρ( ˆE(X)),
for which (i) ρ( ˆE(X)) ≥0 for all X ∈F; (ii) ρ( ˆE(Ω)) = 1; and (iii) ρ( ˆE(∪Xi)) =
P ρ( ˆE(Xi)) for all disjoint sequences (Xi) ⊂F.
We can use a Moment Generating Operator ˆA and its associated Probability Density
Generating Operator δ( ˆA−u) to construct a special case of a POVM, a Projection-Valued
Measure (PVM), for which all the positive operators used are projection operators,
in two straightforward ways, either using the sample space Ω= R,
ˆE(A)(X) =
R
X δ( ˆA−u)du, or using the sample space Ω= {αi}, ˆE(A)(X) = P
i:αi∈X ˆP (A)
i
. Using
the latter, we can construct a collapse product as
ˆE(A,collapse,B)(X × Y ) =
X
i:αi∈X
X
j:βj∈Y
ˆP (A)
i
◦ˆP (B)
j
.
(18)
The use of more general POVMs allows the use of smaller Hilbert spaces by diﬀerently
encoding measurements, which can be practically and conceptually helpful, however
Neumark’s theorem[1, §II.2.4] ensures that the abstract algebraic structure of a system
of POVMs can always be encoded equally well by PVMs.
As a positive semi-deﬁnite operator, ˆE(X) can be written as a sum or integral of
positive operators, of the form ˆQ = ˆA† ˆA, so for a suﬃciently complete set of positive
operators { ˆQλ} we can write, nonuniquely,
ˆE(X) =
X
λ
κλ(X) ˆQλ,
(19)
where κλ(X) must be positive semi-deﬁnite and all the κλ(X) and ˆQλ are nonlinearly
constrained by ˆE(X) being normalized and being a measure. If κλ(X) = pλ(X) is a
normalized measure for each λ, then the constraint P
λ ˆQλ = ˆ1 is easily shown to be
suﬃcient, and in that case p(X) = ρ( ˆE(X)) = P
λ pλ(X)ρ( ˆQλ) is a convex sum of the
probability measures pλ(X), whether the sample space is continuous or discrete.
If we decide to work in an idealized formalism of continuous sample spaces,
therefore, instead of using the available instrumental discretization, one way to proceed
is to choose a ﬁnite set of positive functions κ(A)
λ (X) —where X may be an element in a
σ-algebra of subsets of a continuous sample space Ω— to replace the densities δ(u−αi),
with each κ(A)
λ (X) associated with a positive operator ˆQλ that replaces the projection

secondary construction.
4. Equivalent noncommutative and commutative models
Because pA,collapse,B(u, v) is a joint probability density, with sample space {(αi, βj)}, we
can certainly introduce operators ˆA′ and ˆB′ that have the same sample spaces {αi} and
{βj} as ˆA and ˆB but which commute, [ ˆA′, ˆB′] = 0, and a diﬀerent state ρAB, for which
ρAB(δ( ˆA′−u)·δ( ˆB′−v)) .= pA,collapse,B(u, v),
(23)
because the joint probability pA,collapse,B(u, v) deﬁnes a state over the commutative
algebra generated by the self-adjoint operators ˆA′ and ˆB′.

Although we have arrived at this mathematics by a somewhat diﬀerent motivation,
as a way to remodel collapse of the state within the quantum formalism so that it is
classically somewhat more natural, the operators ˆA′ and ˆB′ are then Quantum Non-
Demolition (QND) measurements relative to each other[17, 18], for which there is a
long history and experience in their use. The account here is algebraically unconcerned
about Hilbert space representation, however Appendix D presents commutative models
of joint measurements in a Hilbert space formalism in a way that is similar to the
presentation of collapse of the quantum state in Appendix C.
Fig. 2 gives a schematic presentation and discussion of the collapse and no-collapse
pictures of a preparation apparatus P, with the environment of the whole experiment
measured by X, to which two measurement instruments are added, ﬁrst A and then B.
The construction in Fig. 2(b) is eﬀectively of a quantum state ρXAB in what we might
call a super-Heisenberg picture, in which the state does not evolve over time and both
the collapse and Hamiltonian evolutions are absorbed into the mutually commutative
measurement operators that are used as models for the joint measurements X, A, and
B.
Particularly when we model a stream of millions or billions of jointly recorded
measurement events over time, presented graphically in Fig.
3, as we do when we
record signal levels on a signal line at regular intervals, it can be equally or more
eﬀective simply to use a commutative algebra of measurement operators to model a
joint probability density instead of working with a mathematical formalism in which
collapse of the state occurs millions or billions of times. Equally, however, where we
have been accustomed to modeling joint probability densities in classical physics only
using commutative algebras of measurement operators, it can be justiﬁable for a classical
physicist or in signal analysis to use the collapse product to achieve a useful reduction
of Hilbert space dimension or to achieve other goals.
We can also use a single long sequence of noncommutative operators and collapse
products in diﬀerent ways:
(···((δ( ˆ
A1−u1)▶◦δ( ˆ
A2−u2))▶◦δ( ˆ
A3−u3))▶◦· · ·)▶◦δ( ˆ

(25)
for example, collapses the state after every measurement, which gives a very diﬀerent
type of model for an experiment than is given by
δ( ˆ
A1−u1)▶◦(δ( ˆ
A2−u2)▶◦(· · · ▶◦(δ( ˆAn−1−un−1)▶◦δ( ˆ

Figure 2. (a) Collapse: introducing measurement instruments A and then B does not change the
state ρ prepared by the preparation apparatus P whatsoever, but the state presented to X changes
from ρ to ρi and then to ρij, depending on which measurement results occur for A and B. Exactly
when and how collapse happens to give a joint probability model for the relative frequencies produced
in the three cases has been a hard-fought discussion for almost a century.
(b) No-collapse:
the state ρX is determined by both the preparation apparatus P and the
measurement instrument X, which we might attribute to a principle that for every measurement
there is a measurement reaction; introducing measurement instruments A and then B changes the
boundary conditions of the experimental apparatus, by however much, causing additional reactions,
so that the state of the system enclosed by the apparatus changes, ρX →ρXA →ρXAB, by a
corresponding amount, to give a joint probability model for the relative frequencies produced in the
three cases. The operators ˆ
X′, ˆ
A′, and ˆB′ that we use as models for the measurements X, A, and B
in a no-collapse picture must all mutually commute, so they are diﬀerent than are used in the collapse
picture.
If we think of the apparatus as containing a small number of particles, then it seems unnatural
that small changes of the boundary conditions should change the state, but if we also think of the
apparatus as containing a system of thermodynamically nontrivial waves that is irreducibly noisy at all
scales, then it seems natural from a quantum mechanical perspective that every detail of the boundary
conditions should contribute to determining the state, just as it would for a thermodynamic state.
The collapse picture’s idea that introducing new apparatus does not change the state whatsoever is
mathematically practical enough, however, to override any principled qualms about using it.
We can think of X as any environment monitoring or other questions we might ask about P, from
nonsense to routine to details at all scales —“Is there a cat on the optical table?” “Is the power
on?” “Is there dust or any other contaminant on any of the components?” “What mechanical and
electromagnetic noise spectrum is there in the laboratory?”— all of which correlate more or less with
the results of what we take to be the signiﬁcant measurements, A and B. We can take X to be part
of the state preparation, but that is, so to speak, a diﬀerent picture.
which can be thought of as applying a single, combined collapse only after the last-
but-one measurement.
We can consider the latter to be the mathematics behind a
form of Many Worlds Interpretation, in the sense that there is no collapse except
when the experiment is ﬁnally completed (which we could say happens when we begin
analysis of the actually recorded experimental data, or, more extravagantly, we could
say that the ﬁnal collapse will not happen until after the last human being dies or at
some other cosmologically deﬁned endtime.) Both constructions allow us to generate
joint probability densities, because they are both positive semi-deﬁnite operators as
functions of u1, ..., un and they are both normalized appropriately, but for the same
statistics of experimental results we would have to use diﬀerent states and operators
to achieve empirically equivalent models. A relatively mathematical discussion of the
order in which the necessary brackets are or should be applied can equivalently but more
implicitly be accommodated by more physically motivated discussions about whether
or not collapse happens after every measurement or only after a long sequence of
measurements. Discussions of which parts of the experimental apparatus are considered

part of state preparation and which are considered measurement instruments, which can
be understood as placing those parts to one side or another of the Heisenberg “cut”,
thereby changing our understanding of what the state describes, can be thought of as a
subset of all possible ways in which brackets determine the application of the collapse
product.
If we only allow unitary evolution, with no use whatsoever of operations such
as collapse of the quantum state, as in the Relative State, Many Worlds, and other
interpretations of quantum mechanics, we can only model joint probabilities using
commuting operators, giving an essentially classical perspective of QND measurements.
The absolutist idea that only commuting operators should be used for joint probabilities
was advocated in §7.1 of [2], with the realization that this is not adequate as a way
to understand incompatible measurements and the use of noncommuting operators in
quantum mechanics leading to the idea here of the collapse product. With a no-collapse
approach, we are free to adopt any interpretation of classical probability —Dutch Book,
Propensity, Frequency, Many Worlds, or any other— but there must be a connection
to actually recorded experimental data, to the choice of subsets of the data, and to
whatever algorithms are applied to construct summary statistics.
Yet another fairly natural construction can be thought of as applying a single,
combined collapse in time-reverse order, immediately after the ﬁrst measurement (taking
ˆAi to be before ˆAi+1),

again requiring a diﬀerent state and operators to generate the same statistics, but, as

already noted, there are many other possibilities. Indeed, for a given ordering of n
distinct operators, there are
(2n−2)!
(n−1)!n! distinct ways to introduce the required brackets,
giving the sequence 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, ..., with some choices of brackets being more
mathematically natural than others but with none absolutely preferred.
For a given experiment, we can use whichever picture seems most helpful, but
for each the state will be diﬀerent and so will our understanding of its relationship
to actually recorded experimental data. The profusion of diﬀerent states in diﬀerent
pictures, depending on what approach we take to constructing joint probabilities, is
straightforward on an epistemological or structural realist understanding of quantum
states, however it is arguably incompatible with a na¨ıve ontological understanding of
physical states.
5. Data Analysis and Signal Analysis
A signal analysis approach to classical or quantum mechanics takes as its starting
point the actually recorded data about the jointly measured signal levels on the many
signal lines out of our experimental apparatuses. For the purposes of such a pragmatic
approach, perhaps embedded in a wider philosophy, Megabytes and Terabytes of data
is the practical reality, not the signal levels, a vector in a Hilbert space, or anything
else, even though such abstractions may be very useful and intuitively helpful.
For
such a pragmatic approach, we are relatively little concerned with the wider world that
only little aﬀects the recorded data we obtain in a carefully constructed laboratory or
observatory. The process of creating such recorded data is decades or longer in the
making: measurement instruments evolve as diﬀerent materials, materials processing,
electronics, and triggers and other algorithms are invented and discarded or adopted.
Some inventions are mostly reﬁnements but others are essentially sidesteps, so that
recorded data is never the last word. Data always has a very long provenance and there
is arguably no such thing as raw data[30, 31]. In the recent physics literature, see also
[32].
In very broad theoretical terms, we take there to be a number of repeatable
measurements M1, M2, M3, ..., with the actually recorded data giving us, for each Mi,
in a na¨ıve approach, a sample space Si = {si1, si2, ...} and their associated relative
frequencies pij. We can then model those measurements using operators ˆ
M1, ˆ
M2, ˆ
M3, ...,
for which the spectrum of each operator is the same as the sample space of the
corresponding measurement, ˆ
Mi = P
j sij ˆPij, for appropriately orthogonal projection
operators ˆPij, and we can model the measurement results using a state ρ that gives
those relative frequencies, ρ( ˆPij) = pij. This approach emphasizes how we describe
our measurements and relationships between them, not how we describe what our
measurements are of.
In some cases measurements are clearly joint measurements, in which case either
we can take the measurement operators to commute, or else we can take them not
to commute but we use measurement collapse to construct joint probabilities. When

The collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction
15
measurements are not joint measurements —because they correspond, as discussed in
§5.1, to measurement settings or geometries that cannot be selected in the same time and
place— we should generally not model such measurements using commutative operators,
neither classically nor quantum mechanically, even if the corresponding probability
densities happen to admit a joint probability, because there may be states that can
be prepared for which joint probabilities are not possible.
Less na¨ıvely, the analysis of actually recorded data, whether in real-time in hardware
or software, or in post-analysis by arbitrary algorithms, will take into account all our
background knowledge of symmetries and other aspects of our experiments as part of
decisions about what operators are more appropriate than others as models for particular
measurements. The ﬁrst level of our knowledge about our experiments can be encoded
by imposing additional structure on the index set for measurements: instead of operator
models for measurements being indexed by the natural numbers, { ˆ
Mi, i ∈N}, we
can adopt a more structured index set. For quantum ﬁeld theory as laid out by the
Wightman axioms, in particular, the index set is typically taken to be a Schwartz space
S of test functions on Minkowski space[22, Ch. II], all of which are smooth and have
a smooth Fourier transform, so that we adopt { ˆ
Mf, f ∈S} as an idealized indexed set
of measurements. In signal analysis, the idea of window functions in convolution with
measurements of the signal level is directly comparable to the idea of test functions.
With symmetries taken as guidelines, the actually recorded data less underdetermines
the construction of operators and of a state that models those measurement results.
Where there is space-like separation between measurements, for example, we take
it as a well-established empirical principle that operator models for such measurements
must commute, to ensure that faster-than-light messaging is not possible, and when
measurements are the same except for space-like or time-like translations, rotations,
and boosts, we take it as a well-established empirical principle that operator models for
such measurements will be related by a unitary representation of the Poincar´e group.
For the Wightman axioms, these empirical principles have the algebraic consequences
that
(i) the commutator of operators ˆ
Mf and ˆ
Mg must be zero, [ ˆ
Mf, ˆ
Mg] = 0, whenever the
test functions f and g have space-like separated support;
(ii) where the commutator [ ˆ
Mf, ˆ
Mg] is non-zero, it must be an operator-valued
manifestly Poincar´e-invariant functional of the test functions f and g.
In addition, a Wightman ﬁeld requires three a priori conventions,
(iii) the vacuum state is a Poincar´e-invariant starting point for the construction of other
states, a convention strongly suggested by (i) and (ii);
(iv) generators of time-like translations —Hamiltonian operators— are required to have
a positive spectrum;
(v) the operator
ˆ
Mf is a linear functional of f,
ˆ
Mλf+µg = λ ˆ
Mf + µ ˆ
Mg, so that
ˆ
Mf
can be constructed in terms of an operator-valued distribution
ˆ
M(x),
ˆ
Mf =
R ˆ
M(x)f(x)d4x.

The collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction
16
If these and other empirical principles and a priori conventions are either incorrect or
too constrained, however, then there will be some experiments for which it will not be
possible to construct adequate models for the actually recorded data and we will have to
discover new empirical principles and adopt less restrictive conventions. The Wightman
axioms are well-known to be overconstrained, so that there are no known interacting
models in 3+1-dimensions. Gravity clearly may require modiﬁcations to (i), (ii), and
(iii); the positive spectrum condition, (iv), is not satisﬁed for a dynamics associated with
QND measurements[17] and is not required for the Liouvillian operator that generates
time-like translations in classical physics[2]; and the linearity of (v) is not an obviously
necessary choice for a classical nonlinear theory, because one rˆole of ˆ
Mf is to construct
modulated states, which casts doubt on its necessity for quantum ﬁeld theory.
It may seem remarkable that the Wightman axioms have unceremoniously landed
here, however it is axiomatically characteristic of quantum noise that the quantum
vacuum state is Poincar´e invariant, whereas thermal noise is deﬁned in quantum theory
relative to a particular Hamiltonian operator. Signal analysis, in its simplest aspect
of analysis of a single signal level, is a 0+1-dimensional ﬁeld theory, so no such
axiomatic distinction can be made: it is only in a 1+1-dimensional ﬁeld theory that
the mathematical structure of Poincar´e invariance can be introduced so that we can, in
an idealized model for physics, distinguish quantum noise, with an amplitude determined
by Planck’s constant, from thermal noise, with an amplitude determined by Boltzmann’s
constant and the temperature. A distinction commonly made in signal analysis, between
the frequency spectra of red, white, and blue noise, requires extension to 1+1-dimensions
for a distinction to be made between the wave-number spectra of quantum and thermal
noise.
From a classical perspective, the mathematical structure of a measurement
theory is rather more that of a generalized classical thermodynamics than of a
generalized classical mechanics, partly because the introduction of probability introduces
subtleties that are often counterintuitive: the abstract measurements M1, M2, M3, ...
could be thought, for example, to be a mathematical model of temperature and density
measurements at diﬀerent places and times. To my knowledge, there are just three
principled generalizations that make a generalized thermodynamics a quantum ﬁeld
theory: (1) measurement incompatibility [see §5.1, immediately below]; (2) Poincar´e
invariant quantum noise as well as thermal noise; and (3) the introduction of analyticity
by the positive spectrum condition [(iv) above, but this is universally asserted in
axiomatic constructions of quantum mechanics]. A mathematician will be reluctant to
give up the superpowers that analyticity aﬀords, however it is notable that the positive
spectrum condition is an unnecessary a priori convention that signiﬁcantly modiﬁes
discussions of locality. This brief discussion has introduced a wider mathematical and
physical context, which has subtle consequences that cannot be ignored, but the collapse
of the quantum state can be largely understood in its narrow mathematical guise of
giving one way to construct joint probabilities.
Although we can continue the tradition of taking notable features such as sudden
transitions of the signal level on a signal line that are recorded as the times of

“events” as caused by a “particle” or a “wave” or a “quantum particle” or a “quantum
state” or a “quantum ﬁeld state”, and for the quantum state to “collapse” as needed
to construct joint probabilities, because we have become skilled in the use of our
existing quantum mechanics toolbox, we can also —because of the equivalence of
collapse+noncommutativity models and no-collapse+commutativity models constructed
above— take the ﬁnite collection of actually recorded data about those events to be a
consequence of the way the whole experimental apparatus has been engineered. For
future experiments, we can ask a continuum of questions about how statistics of the
actually recorded data would diﬀer if small or large changes were made to the apparatus,
with arbitrarily many additional measurement instruments and signal lines interpolated
among those already there or with the signal levels recorded arbitrarily more accurately
or more often. Loosely, we can think of the recorded past as discrete and ﬁnite; we can
think of the imagined future, in contrast, as continuous.
5.1. Measurement Incompatibility
Joint measurements do not exhaust the use of noncommuting operators in quantum
mechanics, because not all ways in which measurements can be combined are
joint measurements.
For measurements that are not joint measurements —because,
impossibly, an apparatus setting would have to be diﬀerent values at the same
time or diﬀerent measurement instruments would have to be in the same place
at the same time— we may have to use noncommuting operators to represent
the relationship between diﬀerent analyses of actually recorded experimental data.
Algebraic formalisms for classical mechanics and signal analysis also can reasonably
include the use of noncommuting operators[2], because the Poisson bracket allows us to
generate a noncommutative algebra of transformations that can as reasonably be used
as measurement operators in classical mechanics as they are in quantum mechanics. For
experiments in which Bell-CHSH-type inequalities are violated, for example, we must
include noncommutative operators for an algebraic model to give us an eﬀective model
for the results[14][2, §7.2], because the use of arbitrary post-selection algorithms to create
new datasets eﬀectively creates distinct experimental contexts. To require classical or
other operator formalisms not to use noncommutative operators is eﬀectively to make
them a straw man. As Pitowsky puts it[33, p. 112] (saying “commeasurable” for “jointly
measurable”), quoted by Abramsky[34, p. 7],
For certain families of events the theory stipulates that they are
commeasurable. This means that, in every state, the relative frequencies of all
these events can be measured on one single sample. For such families of events,
the rules of classical probability —Boole’s conditions in particular— are valid.
Other families of events are not commeasurable, so their frequencies must be
measured in more than one sample. The events in such families nevertheless
exhibit logical relations (given, usually, in terms of algebraic relations among
observables).
But for some states, the probabilities assigned to the events

Note that there are other ways of discussing commeasurability: Generalized Probability
Theory and other literature often uses the word “incompatibility” when two probability
densities do not admit a joint probability density[35], and there is a substantial literature
on “contextuality”[36, 37, 38].
Fig. 4 presents quantum mechanical models for an experimental apparatus that
includes a preparation apparatus P and measurement instruments X and either A or B,
in a collapse picture and in a no-collapse picture. In general, two probability densities,
pXA(x, u) = ρXA(δ( ˆX−x)·δ( ˆA−u))
and
pXB(x, v) = ρXB(δ( ˆX−x)·δ( ˆB−v)),
(28)
cannot be expected to allow the construction of a joint probability density pXAB(x, u, v)
for which
pXA(x, u) =

and
pXB(x, v) =

We can, however, construct a single state ρX(A|B) over a non-commutative algebra
generated by operators ˆX, ˆA, and ˆB for which
pXA(x, u) = ρX(A|B)(δ( ˆX−x)·δ( ˆA−u))
and
pXB(x, v) = ρX(A|B)(δ( ˆX−x)·δ( ˆB−v)),
(30)
exactly as we are familiar with in quantum mechanics, in both Hilbert space and
Wigner function formalisms, but this is a mathematical tool that can equally be used
when the noise spectrum is diﬀerent from a quantum noise that has an amplitude
that is determined by Planck’s constant. As noted above, a thermal state deﬁnes a
diﬀerent from quantum noise spectrum that has an amplitude that is determined by the
Boltzmann constant and the temperature.

6. Discussion
For joint measurements at space-like separation, we do not need to introduce collapse of
the state to model them, because operators at space-like separation commute. Collapse
of the state has no eﬀect if measurement operators commute. For joint measurements
at time-like separation, however, the collapse of the state after a measurement makes it
possible to model those joint measurements using noncommutative operators: without
collapse of the state or a similar construction it would not be possible to use
noncommutative operators to model joint measurements for all prepared states, already
because of the elementary observation that in general ρ( ˆA ˆB)∗̸= ρ( ˆA ˆB) unless [ ˆA, ˆB] =
0. Any model that uses collapse to make it possible to use noncommutative operators
to model joint measurements can be replaced by a model that uses only mutually
commuting operators, but, conversely, it also may be useful to replace a commuting
operator model for joint probabilities by a model that freely uses a noncommutative
algebra of operators.
In the Schr¨odinger picture of phase space quantum mechanics, measurements are
associated with regions of space and with a state that only models the statistics of
measurement results at one time, evolving unitarily from time to time. In this picture,
it is in a sense straightforward to introduce a nonunitary collapse of the quantum
state immediately after a measurement result, even though it introduces well-known
interpretational concerns. In contrast, when modeling physical systems in a quantum
ﬁeld theoretic way or in the Heisenberg picture, measurements are associated with
regions of space-time and with a state that models the statistics of measurement results
at all times, so we cannot as straightforwardly introduce collapse of the quantum state
at a particular time, but we can nonetheless use the collapse product acting on other
measurements as an algebraic way to construct joint probabilities.
Although it has been stressed here that we can think about collapse of the quantum
state in terms of the construction of joint probability densities straightforwardly
and eﬀectively, the much more elaborate mathematics of detailed models of the
thermodynamic behavior and statistical mechanics of real experimental apparatus, of
measurement as interaction, of decoherence, and even of the observer’s brain or mind,
is not thereby made unnecessary. The many discussions of such mathematics in the
literature are of course just as valid and necessary as they ever were, but at the
level of abstraction at which we here consider probabilities and relative frequencies
of actually recorded experimental results, we can reasonably shut up and calculate joint
probabilities using collapse of the state, knowing that we could also shut up and calculate
using QND measurements with no collapse if we wished to do so.
The mathematics above allows us to model joint measurements by a commuting
algebra of QND measurement operators in any Hilbert space formalism, instead of using
collapse of the state or the L¨uders transformer applied to noncommuting operators,
but we can use collapse of the state if that gives us interpretative or computational
advantages. As presented in §5.1, however, we can and may have to use noncommuting

that are not joint measurements.

and book[39] I have found useful, for a reorienting critique, and to a referee. The ideas
in the paper beneﬁted signiﬁcantly from presentation as a poster at the W.&E. Heraeus
Workshop on Koopman Methods in Classical and Classical-Quantum Mechanics in April
2021.
Appendix A. Idealized logical events
An “event” in, for example, an Avalanche PhotoDiode (an APD) can be transformed
into idealized logical terms that are very similar indeed to the throw of a coin. We
throw a coin, we see it land, and we record ‘0’ or ‘1’. For the APD, we “throw” it, a
billion times per second, say, then we almost always record a signal level of ‘0’ but very
occasionally we record a signal level of ‘1’: this is one aspect of a signal analysis approach
that is also elaborated upon in §5. As for the coin, we have engineered the APD so there
is a more-or-less clear coarse-grained distinction between ‘0’ and ‘1’, although there is
still, as for the coin, a very small possibility of the ‘edge’ case. As for the coin, we do
not have to solve the problem of how every deﬁnite outcome happens to be a ‘0’ instead
of a ‘1’, or vice versa, in complete detail, for an idealized formalism of probabilities and
relative frequencies to be a worthwhile and enlightening mathematical model. That we
obtain either ‘0’ or ‘1’ as a deﬁnite outcome is not something that needs an explanation
that “the state collapsed”, insofar as we engineered the device so that the results would
be either ‘0’ or ‘1’, just as, for a coin, we do not use a very thick coin that would be
more likely to land on its edge, although we can and should, as for the coin, measure in
meticulously ﬁne detail how the APD could be constructed or “thrown” diﬀerently or
its surroundings changed to obtain slightly diﬀerent results.
A more general device will have a less constrained output signal level, however when
we record a ‘1’ from the APD there will typically be a few hundred or thousand other
‘1’s either side of it, surrounded by millions of ‘0’s: the data is so sparse that in practice
we actually record only the times at which a ‘1’ is ﬁrst noticed, each as the time of an
“event”. That compressed, permanently-recorded-on-a-computer classical form of that
classical data of ‘0’s and ‘1’, as the times of “events”, is most of what we have to show
to others from an experiment.
The possibility of compression of the results of APD “throws”, however, as times
of “events”, mathematically diﬀerentiates the results of those throws from the results

The collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction

of coin throws. It introduces the possibility, which can with care be actually realized in
experiments, that results of throws in multiple APDs can be jointly compressed as the
times of “simultaneous events”.
Further algorithms can be introduced to produce relative frequencies that can be
modeled by noncommutative probability theory, which can be as easily accommodated
by Koopman’s Hilbert space formalism for classical mechanics as it can be by quantum
theory’s use of Hilbert spaces and operators, so that we do not have to distinguish
between classical and quantum systems. We know very well, however, that the relative
frequencies of suitably selected simultaneous events cannot be modeled if we straw-
man classical mathematics so that the use of noncommutative probability theory is not
allowed[14][2, §7.2].
Appendix B. Conditions satisﬁed by a state
We take a complex-valued state ρ acting on a ∗-algebra A, ρ : A →C; ˆA 7→ρ( ˆA), to
satisfy four conditions[22, §III.2.2][23, §3.2.1.3][26, Ch. 1]:
• von Neumann complex-linearity: ρ(λ ˆA + µ ˆB) = λρ( ˆA) + µρ( ˆB), satisﬁed even if
[ ˆA, ˆB] ̸= 0;
• positive semi-deﬁniteness: ρ( ˆA† ˆA) ≥0;
• compatibility with the adjoint: ρ( ˆA†) = ρ( ˆA)∗; the adjoint is an antiautomorphism,
( ˆA ˆB)† = ˆB† ˆA†;
• normalization: ρ(ˆ1) = 1.
These conditions allow us to use a state to construct a Hilbert space H and a
representation of A that acts upon it[2, §3]. Suitable diﬀerent conditions, which we
do not consider here, would allow the construction of Generalized Probability Theories
(GPTs) that are not generated by a Hilbert space[40, Ch. 1][41, 42]. In an algebraic
approach, a state should be distinguished from a “vector state”, a normalized vector
|ψ⟩∈H, ⟨ψ|ψ⟩= 1, which can be used to construct a pure state, ρ|ψ⟩( ˆA) = ⟨ψ| ˆA|ψ⟩.
The Born rule expression for a probability density such as
|ψ(x)|2 = |⟨x|ψ⟩|2 = ⟨ψ|x⟩⟨x|ψ⟩= ρ|ψ⟩( ˆX)
can be loosely understood as the expected measurement result for an operator ˆX = |x⟩⟨x|
in the pure state ρ|ψ⟩.
Appendix C. Joint measurement instruments
We give here a joint measurement instrument account that parallels the more abstract
discussion in §1. Following the account and notation given by Ballentine[43, §3.3] and
in [2, Appendix B], so that three diﬀerent levels of discussion are explicitly included

The collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction
22
here, we consider measurements ˆA and ˆB that have discrete degenerate eigenvalues ai
and bj,
ˆA|aiλ⟩= ai|aiλ⟩,
ˆB|bjµ⟩= bj|bjµ⟩
(C.1)
(we will omit the degenerate eigenvector indices λ and µ except where necessary.) To
implement these measurements, we introduce measurement instruments A and B that
are initially in vector states |A0⟩and |B0⟩and unitary evolutions
ˆUA|ai⟩⊗|A0⟩= |ai⟩⊗|Ai⟩,
(C.2)
ˆUB|bj⟩⊗|B0⟩= |bj⟩⊗|Bj⟩.
(C.3)
By linearity, for a general vector |ψ⟩,
ˆUA|ψ⟩⊗|A0⟩=
X
i
⟨ai|ψ⟩· |ai⟩⊗|Ai⟩,
(C.4)
and similarly for ˆUB. We apply ﬁrst ˆUA and then ˆUB,
ˆUB ˆUA|ψ⟩⊗|A0⟩⊗|B0⟩=
X
j
X
i
⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩· |bj⟩⊗|Ai⟩⊗|Bj⟩,
(C.5)
from which, using the Born rule and taking it that |ψ⟩and the eigenstates are
normalized, we extract probabilities
P(A = ai |ψ)
= |⟨ai|ψ⟩|2
(C.6)
P(A = ai & B = bj |ψ) = |⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩|2.
(C.7)
The probability of a measurement result B = bj given that a measurement A has been
made, but averaging over its measurement results, is
P(B = bj |ψ and A measured) =
X
i
|⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩|2,
(C.8)
which diﬀers from the probability of a measurement result B = bj given that a
measurement A was never made,
P(B = bj |ψ) =

X
i
⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩

2
= |⟨bj|ψ⟩|2,
(C.9)
by the omission of “interference” terms, unless ˆA and ˆB commute. We can rewrite
Eq.
(C.8), using a projection operator associated with each eigenvalue ai, ˆP (A)
i
=
P
λ |aiλ⟩⟨aiλ|, as
P(B = bj |ψ and A measured) =
X
i
⟨bj| ˆP (A)
i
|ψ⟩⟨ψ| ˆP (A)
i
|bj⟩,
(C.10)
which corresponds to either
• a L¨uders transformed measurement P
i ˆP (A)
i
|bj⟩⟨bj| ˆP (A)
i
in the state with density
matrix ˆρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|, or
• a measurement |bj⟩⟨bj| in the L¨uders transformed state P
i ˆP (A)
i
|ψ⟩⟨ψ| ˆP (A)
i
,

The collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction
23
so, following the algebra, either we can say that a measurement of B after a measurement
of A is not in general the same as a measurement of B alone, or we can say that the
measurement of A changed the state. Also introducing ˆP (B)
j
= |bj⟩⟨bj|, with an implicit
sum over degenerate eigenvector indices, we can make an explicit connection to Eq. (9),
P(A = ai & B = bj |ψ) = |⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩|2
= ⟨ψ| ˆP (A)
i
ˆP (B)
j
ˆP (A)

(C.11)
which we can express as a distribution in the state ρ|ψ⟩( ˆ

M|ψ⟩,

X
i,j
δ(u −ai)δ(v −bj)P(A = ai & B = bj |ψ)
=

δ(u −ai)δ(v −bj)ρ|ψ⟩( ˆP (A)

ˆP (B)

).
(C.12)
Appendix D. Joint interacting measurement instruments
If we introduce two measurement instruments A and B, with measurement results {ai}
and {bj}, we can also say that we have introduced a single measurement instrument AB,
with measurement results {abij} = {(ai, bj)}, whether or not there is any additional
consequence whatsoever of the two measurement instruments both being present. If
there is any consequence of A and B both being present, we should at least consider
the idea of a measurement instrument AB as something distinct. Suppose, therefore, in
contrast to Appendix C, that there are three unitary time-like evolutions, ˆUA, ˆUB, and
ˆUAB, with no simple relationship between them, instead of writing ˆUAB = ˆUB ˆUA. When
both A and B are oﬀ(or not present), neither instrument changes state, but when one of
A or B is on then there is a set of eigenstates of the prepared system that corresponds to
each measurement result for the instrument that is on, |aiλ⟩∈H, |bjµ⟩∈H; when both
A and B are on then we can in the same way take it that there is a set of eigenstates
|abijν⟩∈HAB ̸= H that corresponds to each joint measurement result and commuting
operators ˆA′ and ˆB′, for which
ˆA|aiλ⟩= ai|aiλ⟩,
ˆB|bjµ⟩= bj|bjµ⟩,
(C.1)
ˆA′|abijν⟩= ai|abijν⟩,
ˆB′|abijν⟩= bj|abijν⟩,
ˆA′ ˆB′|abijν⟩= aibj|abijν⟩,
(D.1)
where the sample space associated with each instrument does not change when both
A and B are on, but the Hilbert space HAB is in general of higher dimension than
the dimension of H (the degenerate eigenvector indices λ, µ, and ν aside, which we will
hereafter omit.) Given that the measurement instruments A, B, and AB that implement
these measurements are initially in vector states |A0⟩, |B0⟩, and |A0⟩⊗|B0⟩, and given
unitary evolutions
ˆUA|ai⟩
⊗|A0⟩⊗|B0⟩= |ai⟩
⊗|Ai⟩⊗|B0⟩,
(C.2)
ˆUB|bj⟩
⊗|A0⟩⊗|B0⟩= |bj⟩
⊗|A0⟩⊗|Bj⟩,
(C.3)
ˆUAB|abij⟩⊗|A0⟩⊗|B0⟩= |abij⟩⊗|Ai⟩⊗|Bj⟩,
(D.2)

The collapse of a quantum state as a joint probability construction
24
then for a general vector |ψAB⟩∈HAB we have
ˆUAB|ψAB⟩⊗|A0⟩⊗|B0⟩=
X
j
X
i
⟨abij|ψAB⟩· |abij⟩⊗|Ai⟩⊗|Bj⟩.
(D.3)
In contrast, for ˆUB ˆUA and |ψ⟩∈H, we have
ˆUB ˆUA|ψ⟩⊗|A0⟩⊗|B0⟩=
X
j
X
i
⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩· |bj⟩⊗|Ai⟩⊗|Bj⟩.
(C.5)
Therefore, using the Born rule as in Appendix C, we have the probabilities
P(A = ai|ψ, A is on and B is oﬀ)
= |⟨ai|ψ⟩|2,
(C.6)
P(B = bj|ψ, A is oﬀand B is on)
= |⟨bj|ψ⟩|2,
(C.9)
P(A = ai & B = bj|ψAB, A is on and B is on) = |⟨abij|ψAB⟩|2,
(D.4)
P(A = ai & B = bj |ψ, A is on, collapse, and B is on) = |⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩|2. (C.7)
The eigenstates |abij⟩are mutually orthonormal, so we can certainly ﬁnd vectors |ψAB⟩
such that |⟨abij|ψAB⟩|2 = |⟨bj|ai⟩⟨ai|ψ⟩|2, for any vector |ψ⟩, eﬀectively as a Hilbert space
presentation of the abstract algebraic proof given by Eq. (24). This is only a minimal
constraint on |ψAB⟩, which can be more constrained by performing measurements that
are incompatible with the measurement instrument AB.
As emphasized in §5.1, in general there may not exist a joint probability
conditionalized on “only one of A and B is on” for which the marginals are
P(A = ai|ψ, A is on and B is oﬀ) =
X
j
P(A = ai & B = bj|only one of A and B is on),
P(B = bj|ψ, A is oﬀand B is on) =
X
i
P(A = ai & B = bj|only one of A and B is on),
if the conditionalizations on (ψ, “A is on and B is oﬀ”), on (ψ, “A is oﬀand B is on”),
and on “only one of A and B is on” are suﬃciently independent.
The joint evolution ˆUAB models the relationship between the state preparation
and the joint measurement instrument AB as a joint process, instead of taking the
measurement instrument A to be prior to the measurement instrument B. Even if a
particle-inspired idea about what happens inside the experimental apparatus thinks
of a particle being registered ﬁrst by the measurement instrument A and being
registered second by the measurement instrument B, we can nonetheless also consider
an alternative model that is less causal, less particle-inspired, and more algebraic, in
which there is a joint registration of measurement results in the joint measurement
instrument AB. This and other models may be helpful to have available for those times
when particle-inspired ideas about what happens inside an experimental apparatus lead
to confusion.
