Climate Uncertainty Monster 
  
The “monster” is a metaphor used in analysis of the 
response of the scientific community to uncertainties at the 
climate science-policy interface. 
 
Confusion and ambiguity associated with:  
§   knowledge versus ignorance  
§   objectivity versus subjectivity  
§   facts versus values  
§   prediction versus speculation  
§   science versus policy  

JC’s history with the 
climate uncertainty monster: I 
Oct 2003 presentation to the NRC CRC: Some Thoughts on 
Uncertainty: Applying Lessons to the CCSP Synthesis and 
Assessment Products 
 
•  Is the assessment process and “science for policy” (as 
interpreted by climate scientists) torquing climate science 
in a direction that is fundamentally less useful for both 
science and policy? 
•  The answer to this question is probably “yes”,              
and both the root of the problem and its                     
eventual solution lies in how scientists and            
decision makers deal with the issue of             
uncertainty. 

JC’s history with the 
climate uncertainty monster: II 
Spring 2005 presentation to Physicians for Social 
Responsibility: 
 
“There is no question that the climate is warming; the 
issue is what is causing the warming.” 
 
“It is very difficult to separate natural               
variability from that caused by humans.”

Trying to ignore the monster 
 
JC:  “Don’t listen to what one scientist says; listen to the 
consensus reached by over a thousand scientists.”

JC speaks out: 
•  Need for public availability of data, 
    greater transparency of methods 
•  Need for greater acknowledgement of 
    uncertainties 
•  Emphasized importance of scientific  
    integrity

Why I Wrote About Judith Curry 
“Simply by giving Judith Curry’s views 
a respectful airing, I’ve already drawn 
accusations of being irresponsible — 
and it’s valid to raise the question of 
whether giving her any sort of platform 
is a bad idea.”

Given the complexity of the climate problem, expert 
judgments about uncertainty and confidence levels are 
made on issues that are dominated by unquantifiable 
uncertainties.  
 
Consensus building process: exercise in collective 
judgment in areas of uncertain knowledge.  
 
Consilience of evidence: combines a  
compilation of evidence with subjective  
Bayesian reasoning -- independent lines  
of evidence that are explained by the 
 same theoretical account.

Key finding of the IPCC AR4: 
 
 
    
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
97% of climate experts agree with this statement 
(Anderegg et al. 2010) 
INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 
UNEP 
WMO 
  “Most of the observed increase in global 
   average temperatures since the mid-20th 
   century is very likely [>90%] due to the 
   observed increase in anthropogenic  
   greenhouse gas concentrations.”  

Auditing the IPCC’s 
attribution statement 
Auditing focuses on accountability: 
1)  Treatment of scientific uncertainties  
2)  Traceability of the assessment 
3)  Logic of the argument 
 

 
FAR (1990):  “The size of this warming is broadly consistent 
with predictions of climate models, but it is also of the same 
magnitude as natural climate variability.” 
SAR (1995): "The balance of evidence suggests a discernible 
human influence on global climate." 
TAR (2001):  “There is new and stronger evidence that most of 
the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to 
human activities." 
AR4 (2007):  “Most of the observed increase in global average 
temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to 
the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas 
concentrations.” 
 
Evolution of the IPCC attribution statement 
 
  Is this “uncertainty monster exorcism” warranted? 

Figure 9.20, IPCC AR4 WG I 
The strong agreement between 
observations and model simulations 
that combine both natural and  
anthropogenic forcing provide  
confidence that: 
 
• observations are correct 
 
• external forcing data is correct 
 
• climate models are correct and  
  agree with each other 
 
• sensitivity of the climate models 
  to increasing CO2 is correct

Sources of Uncertainty 
•  External forcing:  solar and aerosols 
 
•  Climate sensitivity  
•  Assessment of natural internal variability 

Current understanding of the solar forcing is Svalgaard 
The other curves were used as forcing in TAR, AR4 
Uncertainty: Solar Forcing 
level of understanding: low 
For reference: 20th century CO2 forcing is 1.7 W m-2 

Uncertainty: Aerosol Forcing 
level of understanding: low 
•  IPCC AR4:  The net aerosol forcing over the 20th 
century likely ranges between –1.7 and –0.1 W m–2 
•  Morgan et al. (2006) expert elicitation:                      
–2.1 to –0.25 W m–2  with a much greater range of 
uncertainty (as high as 7 W m-2) 
•  Modeling groups selected their preferred forcing data 
sets using inverse modeling, whereby  the magnitude 
of “uncertain parameters is varied in order to provide a 
best fit to the observational record.”

Why we should be skeptical of the 
IPCC AR4 attribution statement 
•  Lack of traceability in the “expert judgment” 
assessment 
•  Circular reasoning associated with tuning model 
parameters and forcing to agree with 20th century 
observations 
•  Bootstrapped plausibility of the  
    models, forcing data, and  
    observations 
•  High precision and confidence  
    [very likely] in a non quantitative  
    and imprecise statement [most]. 
 

 
 
§  Explicit consensus building processes can enforce 
overconfidence and belief polarization.  
§  Beliefs tend to serve as agents in their own confirmation 
§  Dismissal of skepticism is detrimental to scientific progress 
§  Disagreement provides a basis for focusing research in a 
certain area, and so moves the science forward.  
§  Overreliance on expert judgment motivates  
    shortcuts in reasoning and hidden biases

Key finding of the IPCC AR4: 
    
   “Most of the observed increase in global 
   average temperatures since the mid-20th

   97% of climate experts agree with this 
   statement (Anderegg et al. 2010)    

Why is there such strong belief among 
scientists in the IPCC attribution statement? 
Some hypotheses: 
•  Overconfident interpretation of the scientific evidence 
•  Groupthink in context of a consensus building process 
•  Confidence in, and authority of, the IPCC 
•  High salience of the issue motivates individuals to take a stand 
•  Solidarity among scientists against a perceived “war on 
science” 
•  Defense of the status quo (includes strong funding) 
•  Personal and political sympathies for environmental movement 
•  UNFCCC/IPCC ideology 
*   Reasons for JC’s belief ca. 2006-2008 

IPCC/UNFCC Ideology 
1.  Anthropogenic climate change is real 
2.  Anthropogenic climate change is dangerous  
3.  Action is needed to prevent dangerous climate 
change 
4.  Deniers are attacking climate science and 
scientists 
5.  Deniers and fossil fuel industry are delaying 
UNFCCC CO2 stabilization policies. 

Attributes of ideologues: 
 
1. 
 Absence of doubt 
 
2. 
 Intolerance of debate 
 
3. 
 Appeal to authority 
 
4. 
A desire to convince others of the ideological truth 
 
5. 
 A willingness to punish those that don’t concur 
Heresy implies dogma  
             implies ideologues 

•  “The climate change deniers have very successfully caused 
major diversions from the much needed debate about what to 
do about climate change and how to implement it. It is important 
that climate scientists learn how to counter the distracting 
strategies of deniers.” 
•  “The media have been complicit in the disinformation campaign 
of the deniers.” 
•  “The corrupting influence of funding from all sources of vested 
interests prevents [politicians] from doing the right thing on 
behalf of the country and civilization as a whole.” 
•  “Unfortunately, society is not ready to face up to these 
challenges and the needed changes in the way we create order 
and govern ourselves.”

5.  Not worried about global warming

§  Target critical 
uncertainties 
§  Enlarge the knowledge 
base for decisions 
§  Precautionary principle  
§  Adaptive management 
§  Build a resilient society 
Options for decision makers confronted  
with deep uncertainty: 
 
Understanding uncertainty and areas of ignorance is 
critical information for the decision making process 

 
 
§  Get rid of the consensus seeking approach to climate 
assessments 
§  Bring considerations of doubt, uncertainty, and ignorance 
to the forefront of the climate debate 
§  Greater emphasis on understanding natural climate 
variability 
§  Recognize that at the science-policy interface, 
understanding uncertainty and ignorance is                       
of paramount importance
