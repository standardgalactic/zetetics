Abstract 
The present work focuses on the additivity hypothesis of Cognitive Load Theory in the frame 
of a research program supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (German Research 
Foundation; grant Br 2082/6-1). The additivity hypothesis predicts that effects of load-
inducing factors on learning are additive (Paas, Renkl, & Sweller, 2003a). Until now, this core 
assumption of the widespread used theory has never been empirically tested. The present 
work investigated different combinations of extraneous and germane load factors in self-
paced multimedia instruction to examine the additivity hypothesis. The instruction explained 
a molecular process in the domain of Biology and contained 11 multimedia screens with static 
pictures accompanied by verbal explanations. The highly complex learning issue is about 
structural as well as procedural information of energy storage in cells. Modality of the verbal 
explanation and seductive details served as extraneous load factors, while support for 
coherence formation and mental animation tasks served as germane load factors. Four 
preliminary single effect studies (n = 23-78 each) proved stable effects of these factors on 
learning performance. Three main studies (n = 99-100 each) varied thereafter two extraneous 
load factors (modality x seductive details), one extraneous and one germane load factor 
(modality x support for coherence formation), as well as two germane load factors (support 
for coherence formation x mental animation tasks), respectively, in a 2x2 factorial design. In 
these three studies, overall 299 high school students (71.3 % female) of different German 
schools with mean age of 17.05 years (SD = 1.39) participated. Results on learning success 
and the subjectively rated cognitive load (Paas, 1994) served as dependent variables. Spatial 
ability, prior knowledge and time-on-task were introduced as control variables. Analyses of 
variance or covariance were conducted using experimental condition as between-subject 
factor and post-test score and cognitive load ratings, respectively, to test the learning and total 
cognitive load effects predicted by Cognitive Load Theory. Results showed none of the main 
effects in learning success and cognitive load, predicted by the additivity hypothesis. 
However, some interesting interaction effects turned out, which were generally not predicted 
by the additivity hypothesis. In sum, results suggest that combined effects of different 
cognitive load factors are not necessarily additive. They overall contradict the additivity 
hypothesis. The last chapter discusses implications for cognitive load research and 
implications of the found interesting boundary effects of the present work resulting in future 
directions.

Zusammenfassung 
Die vorliegende Arbeit untersucht die Additivitätshypothese der Cognitive Load Theory im 
Rahmen eines von der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft geförderten Forschungsprojekts 
(Br 2082/6-1). Die Additivitätshypothese besagt, dass Effekte load-induzierender Faktoren 
additiv wirken (Paas, Renkl, & Sweller, 2003a). Bislang wurde diese Kernannahme der weit 
verbreitet genutzten Theorie jedoch empirisch nie überprüft. Um die Additivitätshypothese zu 
testen, untersucht die vorliegende Arbeit verschiedene Kombinationen von extraneous und 
germane load Faktoren in einer selbstgesteuerten multimedialen Instruktion. Diese erklärt den 
Aufbau und Prozesse eines Moleküls aus der Biologie und umfasst 11 Bildschirmseiten mit 
statischen Bildern und Begleittext. Das hoch komplexe Lernthema beinhaltet Struktur- und 
Prozessinformationen zur Speicherung von Energie in den Zellen. Die Modalität des 
Begleittexts und Seductive Details dienen als extraneous load Faktoren, wohingegen 
Kohärenzbildungshilfen und mentale Animationsaufgaben als germane load Faktoren 
fungieren. Vier Pilotstudien (jeweils n = 23-78) wiesen stabile Effekte dieser Faktoren auf den 
Lernerfolg nach. Die drei daraufhin durchgeführten Hauptstudien (jeweils n = 99-100) 
variierten jeweils zwei extraneous (Modalität x Seductive Details), einen extraneous und 
einen germane (Modalität x Kohärenzbildungshilfen) bzw. zwei germane load Faktoren 
(Kohärenzbildungshilfen x mentale Animationsaufgaben) in einem 2x2 faktoriellen Design. 
Insgesamt nahmen an diesen drei Studien 299 Oberstufenschüler (71.3 % Mädchen) aus 
verschiedenen deutschen Schulen mit einem durchschnittlichen Alter von 17.05 Jahren (SD = 
1.39) teil. Der Lernerfolg und die subjektive Beurteilung der kognitiven Belastung (Paas, 
1994) dienten als abhängige Variablen. Als Kontrollvariablen wurden das räumliche 
Vorstellungsvermögen, das Vorwissen und die Lernzeit erfasst. In Varianz- bzw. 
Kovarianzanalysen wurden die Experimentalbedingungen als Zwischensubjektfaktoren und 
die Lernerfolgs- bzw. cognitive load-Werte genutzt, um die aus der Cognitive Load Theory 
abgeleiteten Lern- und Load-Effekte zu testen. Die Ergebnisse zeigten keine der durch die 
Addititvitätshypothese erwarteten Haupteffekte im Lernerfolg bzw. in der kognitiven 
Belastung. Es ergaben sich jedoch einige interessante Interaktionseffekte, welche auf Basis 
der Additivitätshypothese generell nicht zu erwarten waren. Zusammenfassend weisen die 
Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass kombinierte Effekte verschiedener load-Faktoren nicht 
notwendigerweise 
additiv 
wirken. 
Insgesamt 
widersprechen 
die 
Ergebnisse 
der 
Additivitätshypothese. Welche Implikation diese Falsifikation und die gefundenen 
Nebeneffekte für die cognitive load Forschung haben, wird im letzten Kapitel diskutiert und 
mündet in einen Forschungsausblick.

1. Introduction 
Recently Cognitive Load Theory became one of the most influencing models for empirical 
research in learning and instruction. Cognitive Load Theory raises the question how should 
instruction be designed to efficiently support complex knowledge acquisition by taking 
characteristics of the cognitive system into account. However, what do we win by analyzing 
cognitive processes in learning situations in addition to an analysis of the learning outcome? It 
is not enough to assign different operationalized levels of the learning outcome as 
qualitatively different processing levels by differentiating between recall, comprehension and 
transfer performance. A high level of transfer performance is perhaps associated with a high 
investment in the learning process of the learner, but it is not a guarantee for deep processing 
as some studies assume with their designs (DeLeeuw & Mayer, 2008; Mayer, 2005; Mayer & 
Moreno, 1998). Only a direct measurement of process variables themselves can illuminate the 
quality of the learning process. One could imagine two learners who reached the same 
learning outcome level, with one of the learners not investing very much effort to reach this 
level, while the other one really was engaged to get the same level. Because of this 
information about the invested effort while learning it is possible to ask about instructional 
changes that can be made to get the learner who was not as engaged to a higher outcome as 
well as how to support the learner, who has invested. In the cognitive load approach, it is not 
as much the question about reaching a certain outcome, but about the processes necessary to 
reach a certain quality of learning outcome. To summarize, cognitive load investigations 
focus on the cost-benefit proportion in learning situations. 
The extent of cognitive load has shown to be the central variable in the learning 
process. According to Cognitive Load Theory (CLT; Chandler & Sweller, 1991; Paas, Renkl 
& Sweller, 2003a; Sweller, van Merriënboer, & Paas, 1998) knowledge acquisition depends 
on the efficiency of the use of the available (limited) cognitive resources. In addition, the 
extent of cognitive load is determined by the following three components (Sweller et al., 
1998). First, intrinsic cognitive load is associated with the given complexity of instruction. 
The more complex the learning task, the higher intrinsic cognitive load. Second, extraneous 
cognitive load is caused by the design of the learning material. Information should be 
presented in a way that crucial aspects can be extracted easily without unnecessary add-ons. 
Finally, germane cognitive load evolves from learning activities, which foster understanding. 
Germane load is a positive cognitive load factor attributed to the processing, construction and 
automation of schemata and is highly dependent on the learner. The basic assumption of 

 
2
Cognitive Load Theory is that the overall cognitive load is additively composed of these three 
load types. Thus, Cognitive Load Theory is not only a triarchic theory, but also is based on 
the so-called additivity hypothesis. Overall, the optimal use of working memory capacity 
depends on these three sources of cognitive load. Research over the last two decades indicates 
that an instructional designer should try to reduce extraneous load and to foster germane load. 
Morerecent studies show that even intrinsic cognitive load, which was at first not assumed to 
be manipulable, can be varied. For example intrinsic load can be manipulatied by a stepwise 
enrichment of the presentation of a learning task by scaffolding a concept (see for example 
Gerjets, Scheiter & Catrambone, 2004). Yet, the basic assumption of Cognitive Load Theory, 
the additivity hypothesis, has never been empirically tested. The present work intends to close 
this research gap. 
Therefore three 2 x 2 factorial experiments in the area of learning and instruction were 
designed to investigate whether cumulative effects of the combination of every two 
instructional measures on knowledge acquisition are present, as the additivity hypothesis 
would predict. The additivity hypothesis results in the same hypothesis with regard to the 
knowledge acquisition, but in different hypotheses regarding cognitive load, respectively to 
the chosen combination of instructional measures in the related experiments. In the present 
work, first the theoretical background including a review of actual literature is presented in 
Chapter 2 (see pp. 3). The statement of problem follows in Chapter 3 (see pp. 67), the applied 
method of the present work is illustrated in Chapter 4 (see pp. 76). Chapter 5 depicts results of 
the conducted studies and presents conclusions (pp. 104), which are discussed in Chapter 6 
(see pp. 124). The discussion results in future directions for further research.

2. Theoretical Background and Review of the Literature  
The theoretical background presents that learning cannot be sufficiently described by 
Cognitive Load Theory. Cognitive load is not as simple as the Cognitive Load Theory 
assumptions suppose. There are many influencing factors that have to be considered when 
arguing in line with cognitive load ideas. The following review of literature includes not only 
a summary of Cognitive Load Theory with its basic assumptions (see Chapter 2.1) and a 
review of research on intrinsic cognitive load (see Chapter 2.2), extraneous cognitive load 
(see Chapter 2.3) and germane cognitive load (see Chapter 2.4), but also other important 
issues, which result from cognitive load research (see Chapter 2.5). In detail, these issues are 
the four aspects prior knowledge, memory skills, spatial ability and time-on-task (see Section 
2.5.1-2.5.4), which are discussed and summarized, resulting in conclusions for the present 
work (see Section 2.5.5). In addition, different methods of measuring cognitive load are 
discussed (see Chapter 2.6), illustrating that the field is still very open of how to measure 
cognitive load and how to differentiate between the three load types on a methodological 
level. Frequently used methods are summarized (see Section 2.6.1) and future methods are 
discussed (see Section 2.6.2) resulting in the description of future directions for further 
methodological research (see Section 2.6.3). Only by mentioning some more critical 
literature, the review of literature is complete. This is done by asking the question if Cognitive 
Load Theory is at an impasse (see Chapter 2.7) and summarizing briefly some alternative 
theories dealing with other plausible concepts, which are useful for research on cognitive 
processes during learning (see Chapter 2.8). All these parts are summarized in a resume at the 
end of this chapter (see Chapter 2.9). 
 
2.1 Cognitive Load Theory and its Basic Assumptions 
Cognitive Load Theory (Chandler et al., 1991; Paas, Renkl & Sweller, 2003a; Sweller et al., 
1998) is one of the most famous theories of educational psychology, which is often used as a 
framework of empirical research in learning and instruction. An indicator for the frequent use 
of this theory are the recent special issues of high standing international publication 
organizations, which attended to Cognitive Load Theory (for instance, Learning & 
Instruction: Kirschner, 2002; Educational Psychologist: Paas, Renkl & Sweller, 2003b; 
Instructional Science: Paas, Renkl & Sweller, 2004; Applied Cognitive Psychology: Paas & 
Kester, 2006; Computers in Human Behavior: Ayres & van Gogh, 2009; Educational 
Psychology Review: Ayres & Paas, 2009). These special issues contributed to the continuous 

 
4
distribution of Cognitive Load Theory in diverse application areas of educational psychology 
research such as: multimedia learning, learning from worked examples and complex problem 
solving. Therefore, a multitude of insights in the effectiveness of some instructional designs 
on cognitive load and the learning acquisition were generated. They are summarized in the 
form of ”design principles“ (Mayer, 2001a, 2001b; Mayer, 2005c; Clark & Mayer, 2003), for 
example the multimedia principle, showing that learners learn better from multiple 
representations like a text-picture combination. In addition, a wide spectrum of instruments to 
estimate cognitive load while learning was established (Brünken, Plass, & Leutner, 2003; 
Paas, Tuovinen, Tabbers & van Gerven, 2003). Plass, Moreno and Brünken (2010) provide an 
overview of cognitive load research, the theory and its application. 
Despite or perhaps because of this convincing empirical success of the instruction 
psychological application of Cognitive Load Theory, the development and differentiation of 
this theoretical model has rarely been systematically investigated, yet is often demanded by 
different researchers (Moreno, 2006; Schnotz, 2004). Thus, empirical work at present is based 
on a very simple model of Cognitive Load Theory which “is concerned with the instructional 
implications of this interaction between information structures and cognitive architecture” 
(Paas, Renkl & Sweller, 2003a; pp. 2). To specify the interaction between external 
information presentation and internal information processing, the recent conceptualization of 
Cognitive Load Theory proceeds from three simple basic assumptions: (1) the assumption that 
different learning contents can be differentiated by complexity of the learning task, (2) the 
assumption that human working memory, the cognitive subsystem for processing current 
information, is limited in its capacity for processing (Baddeley, 1986; Miyake & Shah, 1999) 
and (3) the assumption that learned information is stored in capacity unlimited long-term 
memory in form of meaningful structured complex mental representations, in the form of 
schemata (Rumelhart & Ortony, 1976; Schank & Abelson, 1977). 
The central assumption of Cognitive Load Theory with regard to the learning process 
is that the extent of knowledge acquisition depends on using efficiency of the available 
(limited) cognitive resources. These resources are demanded by three sources of cognitive 
load, which are called intrinsic, extraneous and germane load (Paas et al., 2003a). Cognitive 
Load Theory developed over the last decades into the triarchic model, illustrated below (see 
Figure 1). For an overview on its historical development, see Moreno & Park (2010). 
Intrinsic load characterizes the part of cognitive load caused by complexity of the 
given task. This load type is considered the extent or number of interacting concepts 
(element-interactivity), and thereafter describes an aspect of complexity of the learning 

 
5
content, which is based on quality and quantity of the learning material as well as on density 
of element-interactivity. Intrinsic load is especially high if the learning material contains 
many elements and/or if these elements are highly connected to each other. This load type 
thereafter is a characteristic of the learning material itself, but is also dependent on individual 
prior knowledge of the learner (Paas et al., 2003a). At present, no concepts for modeling 
intrinsic load as a function of the interaction between the learner and the learning material 
exist. Intrinsic load is considered to be stable and hardly influenceable by instruction, even 
though a first attempt to vary intrinsic load was realized (Ayres, 2006), but disregarding the 
interaction with domain-specific prior knowledge. In experimental studies, the extent of 
intrinsic load is normally controlled by keeping the introduced learning content constant over 
all experimental groups and by randomized assignment of participants to the experimental 
conditions dependent on their prior knowledge. Another possibility to keep prior knowledge 
constant is to accept only participants with low prior knowledge, as is the practice of the 
research group around Mayer (2001a; see also DeLeeuw et al., 2008). In addition, intrinsic 
cognitive load plays an important role in all Cognitive Load Theory studies, as they all imply 
that a certain extent of information complexity should not exceed or fall short of the cognitive 
capacity, in order to receive empirically sensitive learning material.

More important for empirical and practical implications is extraneous cognitive load. This 
load type is the part, which is caused by the form of information transmission and which does 
not contribute to an efficient acquisition of schemata (Brünken, et al., 2003; Paas et al., 
2003a). Extraneous cognitive load is in a certain way unnecessary and has a negative effect on 
knowledge acquisition. A typical example for extraneous load is the (spatial) contiguity effect 

 
6
(Mayer, 2001a), also known as split attention effect (Chandler & Sweller, 1992). For instance, 
Purnell, Solman and Sweller (1991) showed that textual and pictorial information that was 
simultaneously, but separated presented (on the right and left side of a paper), was inferior to 
a simultaneous and integrated presentation of the same material (verbally annotated pictorial 
information) with regard to knowledge acquisition. Chandler et al. (1992) interpret this effect 
by the necessity of integrating textual and pictorial information to reach comprehension of the 
overall information. The integration processes are strongly supported by an integrated 
presentation in contrast to a separated presentation. The latter causes thereafter a higher extent 
of cognitive load because of the different design of the same material. 
Learning activities and instructional requirements of learning material, which support 
the learning process, also cause a higher cognitive load as all non-automated cognitive 
activities do. This ”useful” type of cognitive load is called germane load. One example for 
germane load associated instructions is the support for coherence formation in multimedia 
presentations like dynamical visualizations (Bodemer, Ploetzner, Feuerlein, & Spada, 2004) 
or hyperlinks (Brünken, Seufert, & Zander, 2005). By a comparison of media presentation of 
information with and without such support for coherence formation it is shown that the 
existence of such a support results in an increase of knowledge acquisition. Even though a 
higher cognitive load is observable. Comparable results were generated by the introduction of 
cognitive (Hübner, Nückles & Renkl, 2006; Berthold & Renkl, 2005) and metacognitive 
(Bannert, 2004a, 2004b; 2006) prompts. The authors showed that knowledge acquisition 
increased - although additional information has to be processed -, if this information was 
strongly related to the processes required for task execution. 
With the limited cognitive processing capacity assumption, Cognitive Load Theory 
implies that different types of cognitive load are additively related to each other: “Intrinsic, 
extraneous and germane cognitive load are additive in that, together, the total load can not 
exceed the working memory resources available if learning is to occur” (Paas et al., 2003a; 
pp. 2). The contrasting polarity of the different load types has to be considered. 
In instruction psychological research, the demand for the best possible optimization of 
induced cognitive load by the type of information presentation results from the assumed 
additive relation of these three load types. As intrinsic load is considered to be very stable, 
almost not manipulable by instructional measures, an optimization can only be realized by 
reduction of extraneous load and/or support of germane load (Brünken et al., 2005). 
Reduction of extraneous load implies an increase of available resources for germane load 
associated activities, if the overall resources remain constant. In contrast, fostering germane 

 
7
load should result - within the same range of capacity– in an efficient use of resources. 
However, both should foster knowledge acquisition. 
In the last few years empirical research investigated instructional effects resulting 
form reduction of extraneous load associated design elements (Mayer & Moreno, 2003), 
recently, there is some work published that focuses on possibilities of how to foster germane 
load (Brünken et al., 2005; Seufert, 2003a; 2003b). However, it should be noted that the 
assumed effect of these measures are based on the additivity hypothesis of load types that is 
the basis of Cognitive Load Theory, which has itself never been topic of empirical research. 
Typical investigations of an empirical examination of Cognitive Load Theory vary as 
independent variables some aspects of information presentation such as modality, coding 
format, sequencing or the type of training element. The variations are realized in the frame of 
experimental or even quasi-experimental designs with identical learning contents and 
conditions. On the one hand, parameters of knowledge acquisition and on the other hand 
indicators of cognitive load are assessed as dependent variables and are analyzed by analyses 
of variance. With this method, highly stable effects of presentation conditions are shown over 
different domains. For example, a consistent superiority of audiovisual in comparison to 
visual-only presentation of textual and pictorial information (modality effect; Brünken & 
Leutner, 2001; Mayer 2001a; Mousavi, Low, & Sweller, 1995; Tindall-Ford, Chandler, & 
Sweller, 1997) as well as the superiority of learning with worked out examples in contrast to 
traditional problem-solving tasks (worked example principle; Clark et al., 2003; Renkl, 
Gruber, Weber, Lerche & Schweizer, 2003; see also Renkl & Atkinson, 2003). These learning 
principles or strategies can be attributed to a differential loading and unloading of extraneous 
and germane load. However, what is still needed is an empirical examination of the additivity 
hypothesis by investigating in additive effects of some instructional designs, of which isolated 
effects on extraneous and/or germane load are already known. Such investigations would 
allow the examination of the additivity hypothesis. This is what the present work assessed by 
three experimental investigations. 
Overall, it can be summarized that research on cognitive load is based on a broad 
foundation of empirical studies for the instructional application of cognitive load principles 
how to design learning material. This is strong evidence for the extent of utility of Cognitive 
Load Theory as an education psychological framework. However, an empirical examination 
of the  theoretical assumptions about specific mechanisms within Cognitive Load Theory and 
their connections is still needed. One of these theoretical assumptions the present work 
attends to is the additivity hypothesis of Cognitive Load Theory.

2.2 Research on Intrinsic Cognitive Load 
As was stated before intrinsic load characterizes the part of cognitive load caused by 
complexity of the given task. Thus, it is necessary to understand how complexity of a given 
task is determined for a detailed definition of intrinsic cognitive load. Within the instructional 
design of information presentation, the learning goal and the level of complexity of the given 
task are decisive. How do we define learning success, which is intended to be reached? Is it 
sufficient to remember the learning content like for example in the case of learning an 
alphabet (recall performance)? Or is it necessary to understand the learning content 
(comprehension performance)? Should learners be able to transfer the learning content to 
other domains or should they be able to use this content in other situations (transfer 
performance)? Successful learning can be determined by the goal to reach recall, 
comprehension or transfer performance or a combination of these levels of performance. The 
design of a learning environment is also determined by the type of the given learning goal. 
There exist different practical implications, which are dependent from task complexity. 
During practicing simple tasks, diverse fostering learning support  is effective (for instance, 
few instruction or delayed feedback), as there is enough processing capacity for the use of this 
support to construct cognitive representations of the learning content. With increasing task 
complexity, the effectivity of the learning support however decreases. Thereafter, complex 
tasks should be instructed with highly structured methods (for instance, stepwise instructions 
or immediate feedback), which require only a low processing capacity. Nevertheless, this 
consequence is not valid for every learning goal. Some results of empirical studies show that 
the positive affect of highly structured methods are only confirmed for recall and 
comprehension performance, but not for transfer and problem solving performance. This 
phenomenon is called ‘Transfer Paradoxon’: methods that are appropriate to reach a specific 
learning goal are at the same time harmful for the learning success in transfer performance 
(van Merriënboer, DeCroock und Jelsma, 1997). Thus, task complexity as well as the 
learners` expertise should be taken into account by designing an instruction. Both factors are 
inasmuch strongly connected as the extent of learners` expertise also determines task 
complexity. The higher prior knowledge of the learner, the less complex or cognitively 
loading the task will be. So, by which characteristics do we define complex learning 
environments? Van Merriënboer`s four-component instructional design model (4C/ID-model, 
1997; van Merriënboer & Kester, 2005) proposes four components by which appropriate 
designed complex environments can be described: the learning task, supportive information 
such as information for the construction of the given learning issue, procedural information 

 
9
such as some learning steps that are connected to conditions, and part-task practice for the 
automation of routine aspects of the complex task. These four components can be varied to 
reduce the complexity of a learning environment. Van Merriënboer suggests with this model 
that learning tasks should be designed in the way that their complexity gradually increases in 
the course of the learning process. At the beginning of the learning phase, only types of tasks, 
which contain a low element-interactivity should be presented, thereafter being less complex. 
During the following increasing task complexity, some cues focusing on relevant aspects are 
useful in order to guide the attention of the learner to important elements. Such a stepwise 
guidance of the learner facilitates the introduction of instruction for an increase of learning-
conducive cognitive activities. This could be realized by learning questions including some 
feedback on the performance, for example. Van Merriënboer et al. (2005) demand more 
research in this area with high complex and especially authentical real-life tasks. This 
approach of reducing intrinsic cognitive load enhances the limits of the approach of reducing 
extraneous cognitive load, which is limited by the complexity of a given task. As the 
complexity of a task is often very high, the reduction of extraneous load could not free up 
enough cognitive resources for the learning process. Thereafter, it should be invested in an 
additional reduction of intrinsic load (van Merriënboer & Sweller, 2005). 
Pollock, Chandler and Sweller (2002) demonstrate one possibility of how to 
operationalize the reduction of intrinsic cognitive load by the sequencing principle. A 
significantly higher learning success was observable when introducing two separate learning 
phases in a highly complex learning material about electrical safety. In the first phase, the 
element interactivity was reduced by dividing the learning material in isolated information 
units, which could now be learned in succession instead of simultaneous learning. In the 
second phase, the learning material was presented in the original and complex version. Thus, 
learners could acquaint themselves with the given isolated information, at first, and had to 
integrate the separate elements with its interactions, only in the second step. The construction 
of appropriate schemata in long-term memory is supported by such a stepwise learning 
process and results in a higher learning success. 
Similar to this study, Ayres (2006) compared learning groups of three different 
conditions of learning a mathematical task, which was presented with different levels of 
complexity. One group learned from part-tasks (low complexity), another group only from the 
whole task (high complexity) and the third group from a mixed strategy condition processing 
the learning information from part-task to whole-tasks. In contrast to the results of Pollock et 
al. (2002), the mixed strategy proved to be ineffective. The part-task strategy was only 

 
10
effective for students with low prior knowledge and the whole-task strategy was only 
effective for learners with high prior knowledge. These results emphasize that the degree of 
complexity of a task is highly dependent on learners’ prior knowledge. Intrinsic cognitive 
load can also be determined by the level of prior knowledge for example, Seufert, Jänen and 
Brünken (2007) interpreted their results varying the complexity of an integration task in two 
studies and prior knowledge in the third study. The integration task turned out only to be 
effective when intrinsic cognitive load was reduced by reducing the integration task 
complexity or by higher level of prior knowledge of the learner. 
Another example of a successful reduction of intrinsic cognitive load by reducing task 
complexity is shown by Gerjets et al. (2004) in the domain of learning with worked examples. 
Normally worked examples serve to reduce extraneous cognitive load, but Gerjets et al. 
(2004) introduced a modular-example format in the way that worked examples were reduced 
to individual solution steps in order to additionally reduce the overall cognitive load by a 
reduction of the task-related intrinsic cognitive load. The authors could confirm a higher 
transfer performance by this instructional design. 
For practical implications of research approaches described above, it should be 
considered that the referred multimedia learning systems present learning information in 
different formats (texts, pictures, tables, graphics) and deal with a limited learning domain. 
Today, the learning process in the area of multimedia learning often includes complex 
learning material with a wide range of learning opportunities, when possibilities of the world 
wide web are utilized (for instance, newsgroups, chats, online-lexica, film- and audio files). 
These offers support interactive and/or cooperative learning. In such complex and unlimited 
learning environments, factors like self-regulation, learning strategies and metacognitive 
learning activities play an important role. These factors are associated with germane cognitive 
load, which is described in detail below (see Chapter 2.4). As the manipulation of intrinsic 
cognitive load is limited to complex tasks and moreover sometimes very difficult to realize, 
the majority of instructional principles, which result from Cognitive Load Theory, focus on 
the reduction of extraneous cognitive load that is supposed to not support learning. Some of 
the most common approaches of reducing extraneous cognitive load are presented in the 
following chapter.

2.3 Research on Extraneous Cognitive Load 
Extraneous cognitive load is the most investigated load type, which is caused by inappropriate 
instructional designs that ignore working memory limits. To vary the instructional design of a 
learning environment in the sense of changing the learning material is very easy to realize in 
order to compare its influence on the learning outcome; for example the material change from 
a redundant to a non-redundant style. Thereafter many operationalizations exit and expand 
research on the phenomenon of extraneous cognitive load. The general conclusion that could 
be drawn form this research field is that instructional designers should construct their lessons 
by focusing working memory resources on schema construction and automation to overcome 
the limits of working memory. Thereafter extraneous cognitive load should be reduced by 
considering the following effects: goal free task, worked example, split-attention, redundancy, 
modality and seductive details effect (Garner, Gillingham & White, 1989; Sweller et al., 
1998; Paas, Renkl & Sweller, 2003a; Sweller, 2005b). In short, a reduction of extraneous load 
could be reached by goal free tasks, the introduction of worked examples, the avoidance of 
splitting the attention caused by competing elements in learning material, omitting redundant 
information, the inclusion of different modalities and leaving out so-called seductive details. 
This is not even a complete list of effective measures to reduce extraneous load (see also 
Table 1). However, to describe the theoretical background and a number of cases of 
operationalizations, some of the mentioned effects are described in more detail.  
One of the most differentiated didactical approaches for reduction of extraneous 
cognitive load are goal free tasks as well as learning with worked examples often enhanced by 
completion tasks. Sweller et al. (1998) demonstrated that goal free tasks facilitate learning in 
the way that a given goal results in a higher and unnecessary load in working memory. This 
goal free effect is explainable with the reduction of the second given task to recall the goal 
during learning, when demanding the learner to reach a certain goal. Without a goal, the 
learner does not have to recall or even maintain relevant goal information in working memory 
and thereafter has more free resources for developing different solutions or in other words 
self-generated sub goals and goals. In physics, learners, who were asked to calculate as much 
quantities as possible experienced a lower cognitive load in contrast to learners, who were 
asked to calculate a certain quantity.

Goal-free problems reduce extraneous CL as

students’ attention on problem states and available 
operators. 
Worked example effect (Cooper 
& Sweller, 1987; Sweller &

Replacing means-ends analysis with the study of 
worked examples reduces extraneous CL by 
focusing students’ attention on problem states and 
solution steps. 
Split attention effect (Chandler 
& Sweller, 1991; 1992; Sweller 
& Chandler, 1994; Sweller, 
Chandler, Tierney, & Cooper, 
1990) 
Replacing multiple sources of mutually referring 
information with a single, integrated source of 
information reduces extraneous CL by avoiding 
the need to mentally integrate the information 
sources. 
Completion effect (Paas, 1992; 
van Merrienboer & De Croock, 
1992) 
Completing partially completed problems rather 
than solving entire problems reduces extraneous 
CL by reducing the size of the problem space, 
which helps focus attention on problem states and 
solution steps. 
Redundancy effect (Chandler & 
Sweller, 1991; Sweller & 
Chandler, 1994) 
Replacing multiple sources of information that can 
be understood in isolation with one source of 
information reduces extraneous CL by eliminating 
the processing of redundant information.

In addition, studies that investigated the effect of worked examples in problem solving 
showed superiority of learning with worked examples (worked example effect; Clark et al., 
2003; Renkl et al., 2003; Renkl et al., 2003) especially in combination with completion tasks 
(completion effect; Sweller et al., 1998). While worked examples illustrate to the learner how 
to solve a given problem by presenting one complete solution, completion tasks only present 
the goal and some solving steps in order to involve the learner to complete the missing 
solving steps. It is recommended to introduce a fading strategy in the sense of the cognitive 
apprenticeship approach (Collins, Brown & Newman, 1989), which proposes with increasing 
learner expertise an increasing task difficulty in combination with a stepwise decreasing 
learning support by the trainer. This means for the instruction of problem solving tasks that 
first worked examples should be presented then should be replaced little by little using 
completion tasks with increasing complexity. The enhancement of worked examples with 
completion tasks has one more advantage: The learner does not receive the learning content in 

 
13
a superficial way that could evolve “illusions of understanding” (Stark, Mandl, Gruber, & 
Renkl, 2002). By the demand for completing some tasks, learners have to show their own 
performance and therefore get the chance to evaluate the learning success as well as the new 
applied learning strategy. Moreover, these aspects positively influence learning motivation, 
which should support the effect of this special instructional design which is supposed to 
reduce extraneous cognitive load. 
Both approaches presented above serve as two traditional examples of extraneous load 
effects, aimed at improving schema construction and automation by introducing instructions 
that relieve working memory. With the reduction of extraneous cognitive load, some 
capacities of working memory become free and are available for learning beneficial activities. 
There is much more research on instructional measures to reduce extraneous cognitive load, 
as the above mentioned list of extraneous load effects shows. Two further extraneous load 
effects are focused in the following two sections. First, the modality effect will be described 
in detail (see Section 2.3.1) because the resulting instructional principle to present textual 
content of multimedia presentations in an auditory way is very easy to realize in almost every 
learning domain. After that, the seductive details effect (see Section 2.3.2) will be illuminated. 
This is  especially relevant for practical implications as learning materials today still often 
include many goal-irrelevant details that could be harmful for learning. 
 
 
2.3.1 The Modality Effect  
The question pursued by many studies investigating the modality effect is wether the modality 
of text presentation has an influence on learning. A first review by Penney (1989) included 
several studies, which are characterized by highly constrained experimental laboratory tasks 
like the digit span task. The digit span task works as a basis for the development of the 
separate stream hypothesis of the modality effect. This hypothesis suggests that the 
superiority of information presented auditorial is due to the persistence of the A (Acoustic) 
code “that is hypothesized to be rich and very durable relative to a visual sensory code” (Penney, 
1989, pp. 399). In this short-term memory model, auditory presented information is 
automatically encoded in the A code, maintained for up to a minute, and the P (Phonological) 
code, which is produced by internal speech. In contrast, visually presented information is 
encoded in the P code, by internally articulating presented words, and moreover in a visual 
code, but not in the A code for which a conscious rehearsal is not necessary. Evidence 
pertaining to the hypothesized properties of the auditory and visual processing subsystems are 

 
14
summarized by Penney (1989), for instance from studies on lip-read stimuli, and show 
observed effects of presentation modality. 
In a recent review by Ginns (2005) 43 studies are included referring to educational 
psychology research where introduced tasks are characterized by authentic, or complex 
learning material. Ginns includes two actual theories of instructional design that provide the 
basis for an interpretation of the modality effect. It is the Cognitive Load Theory (Sweller, 
1999, 2003; Sweller et al., 1998), which is based on Baddeley’s (1992) Model of Working 
Memory, and the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2001b), which 
incorporates Paivio’s (1986) Dual-Coding Theory. Ginns (2005) emphasizes that Cognitive 
Load Theory has its limits by not taking the effect of representation into account, thereafter 
not assuming the existence of qualitatively different processing channels in human cognitive 
architecture. Based on different theoretical backgrounds, all reviewed studies confirm the 
modality effect. Selected results are illustrated in the following part and interpreted in line 
with Cognitive Load Theory as one of the most cited instructional design theory, which is 
challenged in the present work. 
The modality effect is determined by superiority of audiovisual in contrast to visual-
only presentations of textual and pictorial information in multimedia learning (Brünken et al., 
2001; Brünken, Plass, & Leutner, 2004; Mayer, 2001a; Mayer & Moreno, 1998; Moreno & 
Mayer, 2002; Mousavi et al., 1995; Tindall-Ford et al., 1997). This effect is explained by the 
theoretical argumentation that visual-only material requires splitting the available limited 
visual working memory capacity, the so-called visuospatial sketchpad (Baddeley, 1992) and 
thereafter characterized by an analogy of the split attention effect (Sweller et al., 1998; 
Sweller 2005a). In contrast, audio-visual presentations of learning material activate a 
distributed processing through the visuospatial sketchpad and the phonological loop 
(Baddeley, 1992) with the consequence of an overall reduced cognitive load. By the 
involvement of different modalities, it is possible to tap the full potential of working memory 
capacity. Brünken et al. (2001) investigated the modality effect in a study with learning 
material about the heart circulation system introducing a visual-only in contrast to an 
audiovisual condition. The increase of knowledge acquisition was differentiated by textual 
and pictorial comprehension. Beside a confirmation of an overall modality effect, this study 
shows no modality effect by considering only knowledge regarding pictorial information. 
Thus, learners of the visual-only condition seem not to split their limited attention similarly 
on both visually presented information (picture and text), but concentrate on pictorial 
information. This is contradictory to the general conclusion of Stiller (2001) that visually 

 
15
presented text attracts the attention of the learner and reduces the time for intensively 
processing the simultaneously presented picture. It could also be that the lack of a modality 
effect in pictorial knowledge acquisition in the study of Brünken et al. (2001) is due to 
advantages of multiple representations. Ainsworth (2006) describes this advantage with her 
conceptual Design-Function-Task Framework for learning with multiple representations. She 
argues for the use of multiple external representations, because certain combinations of 
representations are supportive for learning by the phenomenon that one representation (e.g. 
picture) can constrain a second representation (text). This constrain can be reached by taking 
advantage of inherent properties of representations. In the study of Brünken et al. (2001), it 
could be that the illustration of the heart circulation system is generally more specific than the 
textual representation and therefore learners focused on this representation and therefore 
showed a higher increase of pictorial knowledge acquisition. This higher increase in pictorial 
knowledge may be responsible for the disappearance of the modality effect. Thus, the 
modality effect is only observable, if each of the audio/textual and pictorial representation 
does not include inherent properties that reduce the other representation to redundant 
information. Which representation of multiple representations a learner focuses on is highly 
dependent on the quality or specificity of presented representations. In a text-picture 
combination, the text can show inherent properties attracting the learners attention as Stiller 
(2001) argues, but the opposite situation is also possible, the picture presented may attract the 
attention of the learner, as was the case in the study of Brünken et al. (2001). The DeFT 
framework of Ainsworth resolves the contradiction of these two interpretations. 
Ginns (2005) not only summarizes research on the modality effect, but also 
investigates the moderating factors pacing of presentation (system-paced vs. self-paced) and 
level of element interactivity (high vs. low). The overall confirmed modality effect of this 
meta-analysis is moderated by element interactivity, with larger effects for high element 
interactivity material (6-8 interacting elements) than low element interactivity material (1-2 
interacting elements) referring to the construct and its operationalization of element 
interactivity described by Sweller and Chandler (1994). Moreover, the moderating variable, 
pacing of presentation, is confirmed in the way that the modality effect is larger in studies 
where the pace was set by the timing of the audio-visual materials than in studies where 
students studied at their own pace. Only a few studies within the meta-analysis included a 
self-paced learning situation, which were over that limited to adult samples and classroom 
testing situation. Especially the testing situation in a classroom could influence the self-pacing 
in the way that participants do compare each other in a parallel learning situation and 

 
16
thereafter the reduction of modality effect could have been reduced by social interactions. 
Ginns (2005) concludes that the confoundation of self-pacing and social interaction should be 
investigated by laboratory-based experiments using one-on-one testing. In addition, he 
emphasizes that the modality effect should be investigated in combination with dual task 
measures, as there are much more studies published including subjective ratings of mental 
load. 
Moreno (2006) presents another review of system-paced multimedia studies that tested 
the modality principle. This review lends support for a method-affects-learning hypothesis 
according to which instructional methods, not media, affect learning (Clark, 1999). As the 
modality effect was the basis to test this hypothesis, it can moreover be concluded that the 
modality effect holds for different media. Moreno (2006) also concludes that the modality 
effect is strongest for cognitively demanding learning situations, such as those that require 
students to process high element interactivity material and those where pacing is under the 
control of the system. This last aspect is especially interesting for practical implications. As 
teaching at schools and universities is mainly organized by teacher-centered learning the 
modality effect should especially occur in these natural teaching situations where students are 
not able to self-pace teachers’ presentation. 
Other moderating factors are confirmed by Seufert, Schütze and Brünken (2009) who 
invested in a detailed analysis of the two learner characteristics use of long-term working 
memory as one special memory strategy skill and working memory capacity as one crucial 
prerequisite for highly loading learning tasks. The impact and possible compensatory effects 
of these learner characteristics on multimedia were tested by two experimental studies. Two 
aptitude-treatment-interaction effects were found: Learners who were less-skilled in memory 
strategy use produced the modality effect in contrast to learners who were classified to be 
highly skilled in memory strategy use. And only learners with low memory capacity showed 
the modality effect in contrast to learners with high memory capacities. Moreover, memory 
strategy skills and memory capacity were identified to differentially affect multimedia 
learning in dependence of task features and demands. In the first study, it was confirmed that 
memory strategy skills could compensate high demands of interlinking and integrating 
multiple visual representations when comprehension is needed. If these integrating 
requirements decrease, as it is the case in the second study, such an impact of memory 
strategy skills for storing, processing, and retrieving skills was not found. In such a learning 
situation with decreased demands of interlinking and integrating, learners’ working memory 
capacity, which accounts for storing and processing seems to be more relevant and the 

 
17
retrieval of information associated with memory strategy skills seems thereafter not to be 
relevant. Overall, the findings support the ability-as-compensator hypothesis stated by Mayer 
(2001a). However, the confirmation of this hypothesis is limited by the demands of the 
learning task itself. Only when the task was highly demanding and especially required the two 
learner characteristics in question, the compensating effect was found. Seufert et al. (2009) 
studies further investigate the effects of capacity of specific working memory subsystems as it 
is plausible that the capacity of the visual subsystem could act as a moderating variable. 
Beyond that, they conclude that investing in the development of a new instrument for 
measuring specific long-term memory retrieval skills would be beneficial. As studies of 
Kalyuga, Chandler and Sweller (2000) demonstrate that prior knowledge can compensate the 
modality effect, Seufert et al. (2009) investigated the relationship between the assessed 
memory characteristics and prior knowledge by calculating correlations, which turned out not 
to be significant. The authors conclude that the introduced memory measure was thereafter 
independent from learner’s prior domain-specific knowledge. Since the referred studies did 
only include participants with low to moderate prior knowledge, it is almost trivial not to 
confirm a significant positive correlational relation because of the very low variance in one of 
the concerned variables. Thus, for a conclusion of independency of the memory measures and 
prior knowledge a new study is needed, which should include a wide range of prior 
knowledge levels. However, the main result is that besides the well-known expertise reversal 
effect (see Section 2.5.1), the modality effect can also be moderated by more general memory 
characteristics. 
Future research should invest in clarification of the mechanisms that are responsible 
for these compensation effects with respect to the learning process. 
 
 
2.3.2 The Seductive Details Effect 
In this portion of the present work another and perhaps even more criticized extraneous load 
factor is focused on, seductive details. Studies in the area of reading comprehension (Garner 
et al., 1989) and listening comprehension (Harp & Maslich, 2005) have shown that adding 
interesting information, “seductive details”, is harmful for the learning process. These insights 
are counterintuitive and the resulting practical implication of presenting learning contents in a 
minimalistic design without any additional interesting information normally thought of has 
enhancing learners’ motivation has not yet reached designers of learning materials. 
Armbruster already pointed out in 1984 that school books consist of a mixture of relevant and 
irrelevant information, followed by often highly detailed questions (Armbruster, 1984). Other 

 
18
authors emphasize that thematically irrelevant information and long deviations are often 
found in learning texts (Beck, McKeown & Gromoll, 1989). In contrast, relevant information 
is not often stressed. If learners show low knowledge about expository text structures, the 
likelihood increases that learners overestimate the relevance of interesting, but goal-irrelevant 
details (Garner, Brown, Sanders & Menke, 1992). 
The term “seductive details” was first introduced by Garner et al. (1989) to describe 
this phenomenon of harmful learning contents, which were until now associated with 
motivational support in the learning process. A unitary definition of this term is still not 
introduced at present. Different studies refer to seductive details in the sense of highly 
interesting, but irrelevant text passages. These passages normally consist of information that 
touches slightly the main subject of the text and that is easily recalled because of its 
controversial or spectacular content like sex, death or romantic imaginations (Wade, 1992; 
Garner et al., 1992). Thereafter, seductive details activate the so-called emotional interest 
(Kintsch, 1980). Results of numerous studies suggest that seductive details disturb the 
selection and processing of relevant information by distracting the learner form the main 
subject of the learning content (Garner, Gillingham & Wide, 1989; Wade & Adam, 1990; 
Wade, Schraw, Buxton & Hayes, 1993). In educational psychology research, seductive details 
are defined as information within a text (or another format) that is interesting, related to the 
main subject, but only slightly touching it and not supportive for the learning goal because of 
its distracting function. The consequences of seductive details comprise distraction from the 
main idea or relevant information, prevention or difficulty of assigning relevant information 
into a coherent mental model and activation of irrelevant prior knowledge and inappropriate 
schemata. Especially the distracting character is confirmed by numerous studies indicating 
that seductive details interfere with the selection and processing of relevant information by 
distracting the learner from the main issue of the learning content (Garner et al., 1989; Wade 
& Adams, 1990,; Wade et al., 1993). A seductive details effect therefore is defined by the 
negative consequences that result from the introduction of interesting, but irrelevant 
information into the learning material causing a reduction in  learning. Recent studies extend 
this definition from textual formats to other formats like combinations of texts and pictures 
(Harp & Mayer, 1998; Sanchez & Wiley 2006; Schwartz & Collins, 2008) or animations 
(Wright, Milroy & Lickorish, 1999). 
Seductive details can be introduced by additional sentences, pictures or combinations 
of both, integrated into the text or as separately presented sidebars. In computer-based 
learning environments animations, pop-ups or auditory presented material are other possible 

 
19
formats. The relation to the main subject is the crucial characteristic of seductive details; 
seductive details are only slightly related. For instance, seductive details in a text about the 
development of lightning could contain some information about consequences of lightning 
like a description of accidents caused by lightning, but not information about other natural 
catastrophes (see Harp et al., 1998). Other distractions like background music, noise or 
interruptions are not included in the category of seductive details. These elements are better 
defined as interfering variables. However, it could be argued that if background music 
underlining the presented content is aligned with the information it could be considered as a 
seductive detail. This is often seen in  educational films. These sounds are content-dependent, 
but not relevant to reach the learning goal and for some students perhaps not learning-
supportive because of its emotion arousing function that could prevent an appropriate learning 
process (Park, Seufert & Brünken, 2009). 
In summary, seductive details are determined as salient, but superficial and non-
learning-supportive information for the given subject. Seductive details prevent processes 
such as appropriate selection and organization, which are necessary components for deep 
processing and the construction of well-structured schemata. 
This definition supposes that learning material can externally control cognitive 
processing. Cognitive Load Theory describes this phenomenon with its “extraneous” load 
type. The design of learning material can influence mental load of the learner in a negative 
way. Because not every added material to a minimalistic design of the relevant learning 
content is harmful for learning, seductive details should be clearly distinguished from 
supportive material such as analogies or examples. 
Like analogies and examples, seductive details serve as illustrations for the given 
subject, but their informational content is very limited with respect to the learning goal. 
Learners who are confronted with seductive details can be “fostered” to activate 
inappropriate, in the sense of goal-irrelevant, schemata or be distracted from the goal-relevant 
information (Harp et al., 1998; Lehman, Schraw, McCrudden, Hartley, 2007; Mayer, Heiser 
& Lonn, 2001). Harp et al. (1998) showed that students, who received seductive details in the 
introduction of a text, recalled significantly less information and found significantly less 
solutions in problem solving tasks. This effect was also found when relevant information was 
stressed and direct instructions about the learning goal were given. A recent study of Lehman 
et al. (2007) provides more evidence for negative effects of seductive details on reading time 
and learning. Seductive details reduced the amount of time readers spent reading base text 
sentences, and were harmful for recall processes and deeper processing as measured by an 

 
20
essay task. The authors argue that negative effects of seductive details’ on comprehension 
were thereafter due to a combination of reduced attentional allocation and disruption of text 
coherence. 
Moreover, seductive details are perceived as much more interesting than the rest of the 
learning material that could result in a lower recall of relevant information in favor of 
seductive details (Garner et al., 1989; Wade, 1992). Analogies and examples should also 
serve for a more interesting design of the learning material, but they have to be clearly related 
to the main subject in order to illustrate its content. The difference between seductive details 
and analogies or examples primarily is its function. Analogies and examples illustrate the 
content, while seductive details have an entertaining function by enriching the learning 
material with interesting details. Beyond that, analogies and examples are directly related to 
and/or illustrate some aspects of the main subject. In contrast, seductive details only slightly 
relate to the main subject or introduce aspects of the learning content, which are not goal-
relevant for successful learning. This characteristic often results in an overestimation of 
importance by the learner. In contrast to analogies and examples, seductive details are not 
conducive for learning. 
In summary, the effect on knowledge acquisition is decisive for the categorization of 
additional information. A high level of learning success suggests that the added material has 
to be assigned to successful examples and supportive analogies, while a low level of learning 
success supports the assumption that the additional information is only interesting and 
entertaining, but not supportive for learning. Thereafter, the transition from analogies and 
examples to seductive details are possible. The differentiation sometimes is not very clear 
resulting from the fact that the characteristic of additional information can be assigned to the 
level of a continuum reaching from seductive details on the one end to interesting elaborations 
on the other end (Song, 2003). Thus, a supportive analogy or example can reverse to a 
seductive detail being harmful for learning. The crucial criterion for an assignment is the 
relatedness to the learning goal. The more the information is related to the learning goal, the 
more supportive it is and the more this additional information has to be rated as an interesting 
elaboration like analogies or examples. With increasing distance from the main subject, 
additional information becomes a distracting factor and reverses to a harmful element of the 
learning material, a seductive detail. 
Studies investigating the phenomenon of seductive details show a high variability of 
inconsistent results. This could be due to the challenge of how to correctly operationalize 
seductive details. The following definition and operationalization of seductive details as well 

 
21
as the explanations of their effects are accepted by the majority of researchers in this area. 
Seductive details represent a discrete category of information that in general could be easily 
recalled because of its high level of interest and its concreteness (Wade, 1992; Garner et al., 
1992; Schraw, 1998; Sanchez et al., 2006). They are thematically related to the relevant 
information of the learning material, but learning-goal irrelevant. Seductive details can hinder 
the learner, because they activate learners’ emotional interest with the possible consequence 
of reducing cognitive interest (Kintsch, 1980; Wade, 1992). In line with this explanation, the 
diversion hypothesis of Harp et al. (1998) suggests that the seductive details effect is due to 
the activation of inappropriate prior knowledge, functioning as an organization schema. This 
phenomenon is comparable to the well-known priming effect. One activated schema could 
guide the perspective of the learner into a certain direction and could thereafter function as an 
anchor for the whole learning session. This hypothesis could only be confirmed for 
multimedia learning material containing texts and pictures, but could not be replicated by 
learning material including illustrations (Wiley, 2003). Moderating variables should also be 
taken into account when operationalizing seductive details: As mentioned, prior knowledge 
has an influencing power (Garner & Gillingham, 1991) as well as the working memory 
capacity or the ability of the learner to optimally use the limited capacity by a goal-oriented 
management of available attention (Sanchez et al., 2006). If learning material additionally 
includes pictorial and animated information, spatial ability of the learner plays an important 
role in the learning process (Bétrancourt, 2005). 
However, Goetz and Sadoski provided argumentations and results against the 
seductive details effect (Goetz & Sadoski, 1995a, Goetz & Sadoski, 1995b). One fundamental 
critique is that the part of recalled information as well as the likelihood to remember a certain 
information generally decreases with increasing text length (Goetz et al., 1995a). Thereafter, 
it is trivial to discover a reduced learning success as well as higher level of cognitive load 
when introducing seductive details. In line with this argument is the fact that time-on-task  
should be taken into account. Wade and Adams (1993) emphasize that seductive details also 
interfere with information processing insofar as learners are not aware of the time they invest 
in studying irrelevant information. As described above, Wade et al. (1990; 1993) investigated 
many studies, which were criticized by Goetz et al. (1995a, 1995b) because of methodological 
problems. One challenge is that the seductive details effect is highly dependent from the 
introduced learning content. Biographical texts as utilized in studies around Wade as well as 
Garner are basically not appropriate to investigate the seductive details effect, because of the 
difficulty to create a neutral text for the control group. Considering a biography as a list of 

 
22
representative facts and events, it seems to be impossible to cancel personal events, which are 
emotional or interesting in a way (seductive details). These relevant events do indeed exactly 
meet the main subject, a certain biography, and thereafter could not be reduced as a seductive 
detail. To generate a much more neutral text for the control group in such a learning content, 
some ratings of learners’ could identify highly interesting, but irrelevant information, which 
should be eliminated for the control group. Garner, Alexander, Gillingham, Kulikowich and 
Brown (1991) as well as Wade, Schraw, Buxton & Hayes (1993), for example, did not even 
introduce a control group. Presenting appropriate control conditions is the most important 
argument in seductive details studies. The explanation of a seductive details effect is only 
plausible if learners of the control condition really had a chance to learn as much as the 
learners of the experimental condition. The introduction of different control groups should be 
recommended here to be able to argue with more than one between-group effect. Over that, 
control conditions should be generated in a sensitive way representing a learning supportive 
minimalistic design that challenges a comparison with the seductive details condition. 
From the perspective of generating seductive details as an additional element for a 
minimalistic designed learning content, it is also decisive how many information units are 
added to the control condition. Seductive details should not exceed 30 percent of the number 
of information units in the control condition. By exceeding this limit, the argument for a 
confirmed seductive details effect is not very strong. The task to define seductive details by 
information units moreover could be discussed as quality and not only quantity of these units. 
This was also critically mentioned by Goetz et al. (1995a) as their studies show that it is 
generally more difficult to comprehend and thereafter to recall abstractions in contrast to 
concrete, illustrating information. 
Following this argument, the seductive details effect is not due to a distraction by 
seductive details, but due to focused processing of preferred comprehensible and inherently 
sense making information. Illustrations could be seen as especially concrete and illustrating 
information units. Wiley (2003) investigated a study about seductive details of illustration 
format. Contrasting results to the study of Harp et al. (1998) were found as no effect was 
confirmed by comparing an integrated format with a foregoing separated presentation of the 
illustrations before the learning text. However, the interest of learners increased by the 
separated format. These results are in line with the study of Wright et al. (1999) showing that 
the negative effect of animations, which are irrelevant to reach the learning-goal could be 
inhibited by presenting these animations before the relevant learning-goal material. Irrelevant 
animations integrated into the learning material were confirmed as harmful for learning. 

 
23
Therefore the coherence principle of Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 
2001a; 2005a) could be confirmed for extraneous videos: “exculde extraneous words, sound 
and video” (Mayer & Moreno, 2002, pp. 87). 
For a confirmation of another plausible explanation of the distracting effect of 
illustrations and animations Sanchez and Wiley (2006) investigated the influence of working 
memory capacity on the effect of seductive details. The authors argue based on the 
Controlled-Attention Hypothesis of Conway and Engle (1994) that learners with low levels of 
working memory capacity and therefore low ability to control their attention are affected by 
seductive details, while learners with high levels of working memory capacity and high ability 
of controlling their attention are not affected. The extent of controlled attention, confirmed to 
be limited by working memory capacity (Kane, Bleckley, Conway & Engle, 2001), should 
moderate the seductive details effect. This is what Sanchez et al. (2006) indeed found. 
Learners with low working memory capacity were significantly more disturbed by seductive 
details, than those with a higher memory capacity, and drew their attention more often and for 
longer time intervals to seductive details, as registered by eye tracking. 
Interestingly, the different perspectives of the critics and proponents of seductive 
details effects can be integrated in a synthesis. Goetz et al. (1995a, 1995b) disregard the 
distance of information units to the main subject of the given learning material, which is one 
decisive characteristic of seductive details being associated with their distracting function. 
Therefore, the operationalization by Goetz et al. (1995a, 1995b) could be interpreted as 
interesting elaborations that are associated with learning supportive functions. Interesting 
information that is clearly related to the main subject should be classified on the opposite of  
seductive details as interesting elaborations. The discussion about superiority of concrete 
information in contrast to abstract information could be integrated into the concept of 
seductive details by enhancing the above described definition of seductive details with the 
characteristic concreteness. All variables associated with seductive details such as interest, 
concreteness and distraction could be considered correlational. Thus, for an optimal 
operationalization of seductive details, the following characteristics of additional information 
should be supported: (1) more interesting than other information, (2) not relevant to reach the 
learning goal, (3) not directly related to the main subject, but touching it slightly and (4) 
concreteness of information. Confirming these four characteristics of an information unit, the 
creation of a seductive detail was successful, the analyzed information unit can be classified 
as a seductive detail and should be eliminated when creating supportive learning material.

2.3.3 Resume and Conclusions 
The numerous examples of measures to reach a reduction of extraneous cognitive load during 
learning illustrates that this is the most investigated load type of the three suggested cognitive 
load types intrinsic, extraneous and germane load of Cognitive Load Theory (Chandler et al., 
1991; Paas et al., 2003a; Sweller et al., 1998). The general conclusion that could be drawn 
form the above literaure is that it is indeed possible to reduce the overall cognitive load by 
considering some instructional principles such as omitting seductive details or integrating 
different modalities in order to facilitate schema construction and automation. The question 
which now arises is if these single effects are cumulative in the way that a higher amount of 
reduction could be achieved by for example an audiovisual version without seductive details 
in contrast to a visual-only version including seductive details. By such a variation, not only 
the reduction of cognitive load would be observable higher, but also the learning success 
should significantly increase in the audiovisual version without seductive details in contrast to 
the visual-only version including seductive details. This is what Cognitive Load Theory 
predicts by assuming the additivity of intrinsic, extraneous and germane load. 
Reviewing the literature, there are no studies, which combine two extraneous load 
factors, until now. The present work will fill this gap. At this point, it should be noted that  
there are some competing theoretical constructs, which could explain cognitive load effects as 
well. For instance, the described goal free effect could also be interpreted by the fact that goal 
free task could reduce the emotional arousal especially generated by goal-oriented learning. If 
diverse solutions of a task are accepted as a goal, it is more likely that the learner reaches 
some sort of learning goal and experiences satisfaction, thus not investing much more in 
mental effort. Therefore, goal free tasks could be seen as learner-oriented by just asking for 
the learners’ expertise in order to get the learner engaged in the learning process by generating 
the own individual learning goals. Taking the emotional perspective into account, the 
argumentation that additional extraneous load is induced by a learning goal is only plausible, 
if the emotional arousal is also included in the extraneous load factor. These argumentations 
derive from Arousal Theory that was investigated in a study of Park et al. (2009) and is 
focused in Chapter 2.8. A cognitive theory that incorporates the affective aspects in 
multimedia learning, the Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media, was first 
introduced by Moreno (2006) and is discussed as one possible integrative theory in Chapter 
2.8. Another crucial fact about Cognitive Load Theory attempts to distinguish intrinsic, 
extraneous and germane load by correlational means as factor analyses of differentiating 
cognitive load scales to confirm the existence of these three load types. Additionally, there is 

 
25
still a wide range of appropriate interpretations if a classification of an operationalization of 
one cognitive load factor has to be carried out. To illustrate the overlapping load types, the 
goal free task effect serves again as a good example. By leaving out the goal of a task in an 
instruction, extraneous load is reduced as the learning material focuses on the task and no 
other demands are required. However, the inherent complexity of the task, associated with 
intrinsic load, could also be seen as reduced, as there is only one task left, leaving out the 
second task to actively maintain the learning goal in mind. This example shows the risk to 
confound at least the two constructs of load types previously described in detail. The third 
load type, germane cognitive load, and some studies investigating germane load effects are 
described in the following chapter. 
 
2.4 Research on Germane Cognitive Load  
Sweller (2005a) determines germane cognitive load as the “effective” cognitive load as it 
causes effortful learning resulting in schema construction and automation. A sensible 
operationalization is necessary to induce germane load. Adding some instructions, even 
associated with germane load because of their quality to activate the learner, causes 
extraneous load by increasing the quantity of instruction. The increase of instructional means 
to foster learning activities should be well balanced. Thus, the operationalization of germane 
load requires much more sensibility than necessary for extraneous load. There is not as much 
research as reviewed above for extraneous load. Germane load is often not induced by certain 
learning strategies, but indirectly measured with post-hoc interpretations, noting that this load 
type is associated with higher learning outcome, especially in transfer (DeLeeuw et al., 2008). 
If a higher level in the learning outcome is observable, many authors simply interpret that the 
learner in the concerned instructional design must have invested in germane load associated 
activities. This post-hoc interpretation should be carefully considered, especially if an 
experimental design does not include any treatment validation. In the following sections 
studies are described which investigated the germane load effect by inducing well 
operationalized germane load associated learning strategies like support for coherence 
formation (see Section 2.4.1) or support for mental animation (see Section 2.4.2). These 
studies represent two examples of the leading research on germane cognitive load because of 
the consideration of appropriate experimental methodology inducing germane load, 
introduced as an its own instructional condition instead of a post hoc interpretation. 
 
 

 
26
2.4.1 The Support for Coherence Formation Effect  
This portion of the literature review presents studies where germane-load associated 
instructions were presented in order to activate learning activities that result in an increase of 
cognitive load in a positive way. These studies purport that the increase is due to deeper 
learning processes and therefore fosters a higher learning outcome. Support for coherence 
formation is a well investigated example of such a positively loading learning strategy 
investigated in detail by Seufert and colleagues (Seufert, 2003a, 2003b; Seufert & Brünken, 
2004; Brünken et al., 2005; Seufert & Brünken, 2006; Seufert et al., 2007; Koch, Seufert & 
Brünken, 2008; Seufert et al., 2009). Coherence formation is determined by the formation of 
relations within the learning material. Learning with multimedia requires coherence formation 
on a local level, where verbal as well as pictorial mental models have to be constructed, and 
coherence formation on a global level, where the integration of these individual models has to 
be realized. Seufert (2003b) emphasizes that multimedia learning can only be successful if 
each single mental representation is coherently represented as well as the coherence formation 
over all single representations is guaranteed. Processing of single representations is associated 
with “local coherence formation” and “integrative processing over more than one 
representation” is called ”global coherence formation” (Seufert, 2003b, pp. 25). 
Other domains also use the differentiation between local and global coherence 
formation. For instance, in the domain of text comprehension, relations should be constructed 
within a sentence or an overall paragraph as well as over the whole text corpus. Albrecht and 
O`Brien (1993) determine local coherence formation as “connecting the currently processed 
information with the immediately preceding context, i.e. […] the previous one to three 
sentences” (pp. 1061). In contrast, global coherence formation is a process that requires the 
connection of just received information with the information read before, which is already 
stored in long-term memory. There are different approaches in research of text comprehension 
explaining how the process of coherence formation works. Minimalistic approaches suggest 
that only conflicts on the local level result in global coherence formation. However, there is 
also evidence that global coherence formation can be reached without coherence formation on 
the local level (Albrecht & O’Brien, 1993). 
In the domain of multimedia learning, many models imply hierarchical bottom-up 
processing like the integrated model of text and picture comprehension of Schnotz and 
Bannert (1999, see also Schnotz, 2005), Seufert’s Theory of Coherence Formation and the 
Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning, illustrate that information representations are 
encoded first and after that integrated with other representations. The only difference between 

 
27
text comprehension and multimedia learning is the format of incoming, processed and then 
integrated information. However, these models are based on the main assumption of a limited 
capacity of working memory, which is the bottle-neck for all information to be processed. 
How global coherence formation could be fostered now is a special challenge for 
researchers as not only the general limit of cognitive capacity is one of the influencing factors, 
but also individual differences in information processing per se as well as in certain 
multimedia specific abilities like spatial ability. The main interest of germane cognitive load 
research is to question how to foster those individuals that are classified for example as low 
spatial ability learners or low memory skilled learners. Especially the theory of coherence 
formation during learning with multiple representations (Seufert, 2003a, 2003b) focuses on 
cognitive processes of global coherence formation and proposes criteria for an 
operationalization of support for coherence formation. Seuferts’ theory is based on 
assumptions of cognitive processes Gentner (1983) summarizes with her Structure-Mapping 
Theory in learning with analogies. In learning with analogies as well as in learning with 
external multiple representations, the relation between two systems has to be constructed by 
generating local and global coherence formation. Gentner (1983) emphasizes that the goal 
system, which should be explained by an analogy, is mapped to an already known initial 
system. These mapping processes requires first the selection of relevant objects of the goal 
and initial system. After an analysis of the relevant objects and their relations on the local 
level of each system, both systems are globally considered by mapping corresponding 
elements, characteristics and relations. Relations of higher order determine the selection of 
relevant relations for the analogy. If a relation is included in a higher classified system of 
dependent relations, it is more likely that this relation will be used for analogy construction 
(Gentner, 1983). 
The mapping processes in learning with analogies are also required in multimedia 
learning on the level of corresponding elements. Seufert describes these processes as 
“element-to-element mapping“ and as “relation-to-relation mapping” (Seufert, 2003a, pp. 29). 
Before the mapping processes, which is essential for learning, it is necessary to identify 
within each external representation relevant elements, their relations and characteristics. After 
the construction of a coherent knowledge structure on the local level, the relations between 
the identified single representations have to be considered. It is the mapping between element 
and element or between relation and relation that could be identified on the global level and 
determines global coherence formation. Seufert (2003a, 2003b) differentiates between 
different levels of mapping processes in multimedia learning by processing depth. If 

 
28
corresponding characteristics are only detected on a surface level of the elements such as 
format, size or color, the mapping processes are of syntactical type. No comprehension 
processes are necessary to identify corresponding elements and relations, which correspond 
because of their design. Thus, syntactic mapping does not result in deep understanding.  
Only on the semantic level, where searching for corresponding elements and relations 
occurs, the searching of contents results in deeper processing. When the learner begins to ask 
for why single representations correspond to each other, semantic mapping processes are 
starting that foster learning. Mapping on this level is only successful if deep structure of each 
representation has been identified previously. Moreover, in the case of diverse coding of 
corresponding elements or relations, successful mapping requires the translation into the other 
codality. Therefore, learning with textual and pictorial information requires the translation of 
nonverbal and pictorial information into verbal information by internal speech, so that 
mapping to corresponding textual information can be managed, and vice versa. In sum, global 
coherence formation on the semantic level is a highly demanding cognitive process that leads 
to semantic mapping, which is an elaborated mental model of the learning content and is 
associated with higher comprehension and transfer performance. 
Means of support for coherence formation are classified into syntactical and 
semantical mapping tasks. Very typical syntactical mapping tasks are the method of color-
coding (Kalyuga, Chandler & Sweller, 1998) as well as textual hyperlinks (Brünken et al., 
2005; Seufert et al., 2006; Seufert et al., 2007). Color-coding is characterized by the use of 
colors to guide the attention of the learner to correspondences between variably coded 
elements. In the study of Kalyuga et al. (1998) clicking on a certain part of the text results in 
coloring this part and its associated elements in the corresponding pictorial information of the 
learning material. The syntactical mapping is herewith visualized by a certain color. In 
contrast, for hyperlinking no colors are needed as a certain term in the presented text is only 
underlined signaling that this term is relevant and an associated element could be found in the 
corresponding pictorial information presented next to the text. In the study of Brünken et al. 
(2005) a mouse click on the underlined term initiated the visualization of an arrow connecting 
the selected term and its corresponding elements in the pictorial information. The results of 
this study show that hyperlinking is an appropriate mean to significantly increase pictorial 
comprehension performance. The effect of textual hyperlinks highly depends on complexity 
of the learning material. In the study of Seufert et al. (2007) a main effect was found for the 
textual hyperlinks in recall and comprehension performance, using a more structured than 
complex learning material about the functioning of the heart circulation system. Using 

 
29
another complex learning material, the effect of textual hyperlinks could not be replicated. In 
such a complex learning environment, an aptitude-treatment interaction between the aptitude 
prior knowledge and the treatment textual hyperlinks was found in the way that only medium 
knowledged learners profited form hyperlinks in contrast to low knowledged learners. This is 
one more indication that textual hyperlinks are only useful in the case of reduced complexity 
of learning material, realized by the learning material itself or some characteristic of the 
learner. Seufert et al. (2007) argue that these learners are able to use at least some cognitive 
schemata, which frees up cognitive resources for coherence formation. 
In the terms of Cognitive Load Theory, it can be concluded that syntactical mapping 
tasks can reduce the extraneous cognitive load by attracting the attention on relevant 
information and facilitating the searching process for corresponding elements and relations. 
How much these tasks support coherence formation and thereafter increase germane cognitive 
load is highly dependent on the learner (Seufert et al., 2007). The problem of syntactical 
mapping tasks is that their application could lead to a superficial processing only analyzing 
surface characteristics of learning material without investing much more cognitive resources. 
Learners could tend to interpret their performance of searching for corresponding elements by 
following the very illustrative instructions, following the arrows or colors in the case of the 
mentioned syntactic mapping tasks as a comprehension performance. This would lead to 
comprehension illusion and would prevent the learner from investing in deep processing. 
In contrast to this disadvantage of syntactic mapping tasks, semantic mapping tasks do 
facilitate deep processing. A study of Koch, Seufert, and Brünken (2008) exemplifies the 
effect of semantic support for coherence formation by an aptitude-treatment interaction in the 
way that low knowledge learners profited the most from the support. In this study a so-called 
directive semantic support for coherence formation was introduced. The subject of the 
computer-based learning material was the structure and function of a cellular molecule, 
namely the ATP-Synthase. The learning task was to understand the complex structure and 
function of the molecule. Learners had to imagine rotations and movements within a complex 
spatial structure and had to integrate text with the pictorial information. In addition to the 
control group setting, the experimental group received semantic support for coherence 
formation, which was introduced in form of an additional text. This additional text was 
supposed to prompt the participants’ active integrating process by semantically pointing to the 
relations between the text and the picture. It did not include additional learning content, but 
instructions in how the text and picture correspond to each other and how to process both 
representations in order to integrate them. Semantic support for coherence formation was 

 
30
shown to be effective as this study operationalized a support that should activate the learner to 
follow relations between different representations on the content level. Causing learners to get 
involved in the mapping process resulted in integrated elaborated mental models of the 
learning content. These elaborated mental models of the experimental condition  
demonstrated a higher transfer performance in this study. This is a direct form of support for 
coherence formation because the support is explicitly introduced, in contrast to indirect 
support for coherence formation that is characterized by goal-oriented questions and tasks. 
Direct forms of support implicitly attract the attention of the learner to relevant 
semantic relations and guide the learner step by step through the performance-enhacing 
mapping processes. Indirect support, on the other hand,  requires an independent generation of 
mapping processes for a successful answer to the question or execution of the given task. 
Direct support is cognitively not as demanding as indirect coherence formation questions and 
do not have the same potential for the activation of coherence formation processes. In contrast 
to syntactic mapping tasks, the direct semantic support is already associated with the initiation 
of coherence formation by focusing on the content level and initiating structural integration 
on a deep level. In the terms of Cognitive Load Theory, direct semantic support for coherence 
formation should result in a reduction of extraneous load and an increase of germane load. 
In contrast, indirect semantic support for coherence formation only includes indirect 
cues to mapp elements and relations, but the searching and mapping process itself has to be 
performed by the learner. Thus, this support should not reduce extraneous load as much, but 
provoke learning-enhancing activities associated with an observable increase in germane 
cognitive load. If the learner is able to use this support, it enhances deep structural integration 
of representations. At this point, it has to be mentioned that this sort of indirect support 
promote high cognitive loading and should also be classified as a risk for cognitive overload. 
The effect of indirect support on intrinsic cognitive load is higher than the effect of direct 
support, as the learner has to manage and execute a second given task of self-regulation. As 
the working memory is not unloaded by a reduction of extraneous load, the complexity of the 
learning material and prior knowledge of the learner may play a more important role, as the 
results of a study by Seufert (2003a) demonstrate. Learners with low to medium levels of 
prior knowledge profit most from the introduced coherence formation support and still need a 
support, while learners with high prior knowledge have enough free cognitive resources to 
organize coherence formation on their own. 
The most loading operationalization of support for coherence formation is the 
combination of visual-only learning material including visually presented coherence 

 
31
formation tasks such as questions or an additive text. This forces the learner to split their 
attention by switching between the material and the support. Therefore, working memory 
capacity of the visual information processing subsystem could limit optimal processing. In 
summary, semantic support for coherence formation is on a high demanding cognitive level, 
and seems to provide a high coherence-enhancing potential. In contrast, direct support for 
coherence formation provokes passive processing, requiring not as many cognitive resources. 
In addition, Seufert et al. (2006) present evidence for synergetic effects when 
combining directive verbal semantic and syntactic support for coherence formation. The study 
with a 2 x 2 factorial design included the factors deep structure level help and surface 
structure level help. Deep structure level help was presented in the format of verbally 
directive instructions on what has to be mapped and in which way the external representations 
correspond (semantic support). In contrast, surface structure level help (syntactic support) was 
presented in form of textual hyperlinks. Learners in the combined experimental condition 
showed the highest learning performance as well as the lowest cognitive load ratings. This is 
one piece of evidence for a possible synergetic effect, expected by the additivity hypothesis of 
Cognitive Load Theory. Moreover, Seufert et al. (2006) discovered significant differences on 
time-on-task over the treatment variation. Learners of the combined version necessitated 
significantly less time in contrast to learners of each single version including only one format 
of support. Thus, a combination of deep and surface structure level help to support coherence 
formation fosters an efficient use of this support. The authors predicted the surface structure 
level help reduces extraneous load, while deep structure level help induces germane load. This 
combination could be seen as a well designed operationalization to prove the redirecting 
attention hypothesis of van Merriënboer, Schuurman, deCrook and Paas (2002). 
 
2.4.2 The Effect of Mental Animation  
Complex learning environments should contain not only structural information, but also 
process information of the given issue. In this sense, Hegarty, Kriz and Cate (2003) 
differentiate between different types of knowledge involved in a complex system: the 
configuration, the behavior and the functions. The configuration is the sum of components 
introduced in the learning material, their single positions and connections to each other, which 
a learner first has to clarify before being able to imagine the behavior of the presented system. 
The behavior includes all possible motions of components and how they affect other 
components. Different chains of events or even causal chains are central to this knowledge. 
Configurational and behavioural knowledge about the system corresponds to a mental model 

 
32
of the system and reveals the functions of the system. The functions are determined by what 
the system is designed to do and are completely understood when knowing how the 
configuration and the behavior achieve these functions. As learning environments of today 
like computer-based material make it possible to present process information in the format of 
external animations, one could assume that the construction of a dynamic mental model 
including the configuration, behavior and function of a system is facilitated. Learners benefit 
from the fact that motions and the causal chains are directly observable. Moreover, external 
animations could facilitate to develop a high-quality mental model, which includes the 
possibility of mental animation, as Johnson-Laird (1983) proposes within the capacity to run a 
mental model for- and backwards that is directly visible in an external animation. Thus, 
animations should be intrinsically superior to static graphics (Narayanan & Hegarty, 2000). In 
contrast to this intuitive assumption, a review of 20 studies by Tversky, Morrison and 
Bétrancourt (2002) presents that this is not how multimedia learning works. The great 
majority of studies confirm that there is no advantage of animations over static graphics. 
These studies cover a wide range of learning domains from physics, computer interactions, 
and biology to mechanics. The small number of studies that could show an animation effect 
were criticized by their operationalization including more information in the animated 
compared to the static conditions. Lowe (1999; 2003) as well as Hegarty et al. (2003) 
presented new studies where no animation effects were found, and offer some explanations as 
to why animations have no advantages in multimedia learning. 
Lowe (2003) follows the assumption of Schnotz, Böckheler and Grzondziel (1999) 
that animations are not always beneficial in learning. The lack of benefit results from (a) 
excessive information processing demands (‘overwhelming’) or (b) the extent in which 
learners engage in valuable processing activities (‘underwhelming’). The overall theoretical 
basis of these explanations is the split-attention effect, in which attention to one type of 
presentation component may result in information being missed in a different, accompanying 
presentation component (Mayer et al., 1998). To reduce split-attention in animations, the most 
important instructional characteristic of dynamic in contrast to static graphics has to be 
analyzed, this is the capacity to depict a temporal change. This is the main reason why some 
animations evolve a higher level of cognitive load than static graphics (Lowe, 1999). Three 
main types of change are defined by Lowe (2003): form changes (‘transformation’), position 
changes (‘translations’), and inclusion changes (‘transitions’). While observing these changes, 
a learner could be inhibited by an intra-representation split-attention effect analogous to the 
inter-representation effect described for picture-text combinations. The full attention to one 

 
33
part of the display would result in neglect of information in other regions. The purpose of 
Lowes’ (2003) investigation was to help students to develop a mental model of weather map 
animations. Students have to be able to extract information from the animation in an effective 
manner and properly incorporate it into their knowledge structures for subsequent use in 
building higher-quality mental models. The required capacity to develop such a dynamic 
mental model is the mentally ‘running’ of a suitable model forwards or backwards to generate 
a later or an earlier state of the subject matter (Johnson-Laird, 1983). Learners have to be 
cautious in selecting relevant information units of an animation as the ‘raw’ perceptual 
character of dynamics is not by itself a reliable or comprehensive guide to thematic relevance. 
Lowe (1999) already demonstrated in a field study that the extraction of information in 
weather maps appeared to depend on the level of dynamism. In his recent study, extraction of 
information is reflected in the performance of a later application task, not only in written 
records. The results are consistent with the above mentioned field study, as the students’ 
extraction of information from animations appeared to be largely driven by perceptual 
characteristics of the display. Pictorial components with low perceptual salience tended to be 
neglected. Moreover, not only graphic entities determined learners’ information extraction. 
Information tended to be noticed, when there was substantial dynamic contrast with the visual 
context. Animations can attract attention either because they (a) change substantially more 
than their surroundings, or (b) change substantially less than their surroundings. Thus, form 
changes as well as position changes can attract the attention in dependence of their contrast 
with the context. It seems likely that for animations in which users are given no control over 
the presentation, the types of negative consequences for learning of the intra-representation 
selective attention effect indicated in this study would be even more pronounced. Lowe 
(2003) concludes in analogy to the field-ground distinction made for a static image that his 
study confirms a processing of animations that is consistent with perception having divided 
the set of presented information on the basis of its dynamic characteristics into a ‘field’ that 
received most selective attention and a ‘ground’ that served a secondary contextual role. 
Another phenomenon was observed by this study that is the predisposition to search for 
cause-effect relations, which seem to make the material more ‘meaningful’. This could be one 
more aspect that influences the way animations are interpreted. In sum, findings of this study 
suggest that merely providing an accurate animated depiction of to-be-learned material may 
not by itself be sufficient to produce the coherent and comprehensive knowledge structures 
required for learners to build high-quality mental models of dynamic content, even when the 
given animation provides interaction and extensive user control. Therefore, animations should 

 
34
be presented in a more directive learning environment incorporating specific visual and 
temporal guidance. 
The possibility that misconceptions can actually be induced when learners work with 
instructional animation should result in further research on other appropriate means of how to 
present dynamic information. This is what Hegarty et al. (2003) indeed did by comparing in 
several experiments an animation condition with other conditions in the domain of mechanics. 
The authors argue in line with previous research, which has shown that people are quite 
successful in inferring how a machine works from static diagrams (Hegarty, 1992; Schwartz 
& Black, 1996). They refer to the process of inferring motion from static diagrams as mental 
animation. With this process two main insights are associated at least in the domain of 
mechanics: (1) Even if all components of a machine move at once in the operation, people 
tend to mentally animate each component in order of the causal sequence of events and (2) 
people tend to engage in internal visualization processes, such as mental rotation. This is why 
the ability to mentally animate is highly related to spatial ability (Hegarty & Kozhevnikov, 
1999; Sims & Hegarty, 1997). 
The most interesting comparison for the present work is the contrast between a 
prediction and an animation condition. Hegarty et al. (2003) examined whether learners 
performed better when studying an animation after having tried to predict the behavior of the 
machine from static diagrams. This method should increase the learning performance because 
of indirect activation of learners’ prior knowledge of the machine (Britton & Graesser, 1996; 
McNamara, Kintsch, Songer & Kintsch, 1996). In addition, the articulation of learners’ 
intuition of how the machine works could also activate the learner to formulate open learning 
questions and learning goals. On the other hand, erroneous representations of the machine’s 
kinematics constructed by formulating predictions could also result in a competing situation 
by trying to compare the constructed false representations from the predicting phase with the 
afterwards correct representation of the animation phase. This is why learners might also be 
hindered in learning from animations, as the autors argue. This argument is very plausible, but 
does not take research on cognitive conflicts and the theory of cognitive dissonance 
(Festinger, 1957, 1964, 1989) into account. Especially competing representations could lead 
to an active processing by trying to solve the induced cognitive conflict. Thus, the main result 
that people learn more from animated media when they first predict how a device works 
seems to be independent of a correct or false prediction. In a second experiment, Hegarty et 
al. (2003) could confirm that the prediction condition is also effective in the case of static 
media. These results were possibly due to an unbalanced experimental design because the 

 
35
control as well as the animation condition did not include the presented diagrams of three 
critical phases of the operating machine, which served as prediction material in the prediction 
condition. These additional diagrams provided not only more information, but also critical 
moments of the operations to be mentally processed. 
Therefore, a third experiment was conducted to clarify, if the presentation of critical 
phases of an operating system could induce performance-enhancing activities without 
explicitly asking for predictions of the system behavior while viewing some phases. This is in 
line with previous research on mental representation of continuous processes where it was 
found that people tend to present processes as a sequence of key events rather than as 
analogue simulation of continuous motion (Zacks & Tversky, 2001). Thus, some critical 
phases of an operating system might be more similar to learners’ mental representations and 
itself induce inferring the behavior of the given system. The results of the third experiment 
confirmed this argument by showing equivalent comprehension performance of the 
participants in the animated condition and the condition of just seeing three critical phases of 
the operating system even without an additional learning text. These observations lead to the 
inference that screenshots of the most relevant steps of the presented process should be 
determined as a performance-enhancing support for mental animation. The risk of provoking 
a comprehension illusion as evoked by passively processed animations is reduced. Inducing 
performance-enhancing processing with some static diagrams of relevant phases of an 
animation that evoke mental animation seems to be crucial to animate the learners’ active 
processing. This type of support for mental animation is associated with germane cognitive 
load and is one more example of instructions that get the learner engaged the learning process. 
Münzer, Seufert and Brünken (2009) introduce other appropriate means of presenting 
dynamic information to engage in mental animation. So-called enriched static presentations 
showing some discrete steps of processes, for example arrows as a hint to mentally animate 
the cued element of the learning material, are as effective learning instructions as the 
presented animation. The finding that spatial abilities were not substantively related to 
learning with animations supported the facilitating function of animations. In contrast to 
learning with animations, spatial abilities played a crucial role for learning with enriched 
static pictures. Therefore, the authors conclude that in the enriched static pictures condition 
active visuospatial processing is initiated. With animations, learning was facilitated by 
external support for visuospatial mental processing. This study is one more piece of evidence 
that static pictures could be as efficient as animations for learners. In this study, the learning 
domain was a more abstract learning content, the structure and function of the ATP-Synthase, 

 
36
which is a cellular molecule responsible for the active process of ATP synthesis. The 
animation effect found here (simple static pictures vs. animation) confirms the intuitive 
assumption that learning from animations is significantly more efficient. Animations can 
support the visualization and construction of mental representations. However, the fact that 
learners did perform better in an enriched static version shows that these images can also 
activate mental animation when taking the moderating function of spatial ability into account. 
By using enriched static presentations, the risk to produce comprehension illusions is reduced. 
This method of enriched static pictures in combination with the efficient prediction task can 
initiate a cognitive conflict by presenting correct parallel processing contrasting naïve theories 
of the learner. This could be a fruitful instruction to engage learners to invest in mental 
animation, initiating an active and effective learning process, which represents a typical 
germane load activity. 
  
2.4.3 Resume and Conclusions 
The above literature reviewdescribed examples of methods to induce germane load associated 
with learning activities such as coherence formation or mental animation. These studies 
illustrate the most learner-oriented investments in the framework of Cognitive Load Theory, 
as this research endeavor focuses on the development of learning instructions that animate the 
learner to invest more in performance-enhancing activities. The general conclusion that can be 
drawn form the presented germane load effects is that it is indeed possible to animate learners 
to invest in schema construction and automation by very simple instructional tools like 
articulating predictions, answering questions or mapping tasks. The question now arises if 
these single effects are cumulative in the way that a higher amount of increase in the learning 
outcome could be achieved by a mental animation condition including support for coherence 
formation in contrast to a minimalistic design of the learning environment without any 
germane load associated prompts. By such a variation, not only the increase of learning 
success would be observable higher, but also germane cognitive load should significantly 
increase in the prediction condition including support for coherence formation. This is what 
Cognitive Load Theory predicts, assuming the additivity of intrinsic, extraneous and germane 
load. Reviewing the literature, there are some studies, which already combined two germane 
load factors. For example Berthold, Nückles and Renkl (2007) combined cognitive and 
metacognitive prompts and could show that the increase of performance is due to the 
cognitive prompting, because the effect disappeared when accounting for the effect of 
cognitive prompts in the statistical analysis. However, in this study the single condition of 

 
37
only metacognitive prompting was not included. Thus, there is still need of a 
methodologically clear study, which first provides support for the positive effect of the 
introduced germane load factors. This is what Seufert et al. (2006) did, as mentioned above, 
by combining syntactic and semantic support for coherence formation. This study provided 
the  first evidence that synergetic effects could be confirmed. As the authors interpret their 
results in the way that syntactic support reduces extraneous load, while directive verbally 
presented semantic support induces germane load, this combination of two methods to 
support coherence formation and thereafter of “germane load associated factors” can not be 
seen as a clear combination of germane load factors. The problem occurring at this point is 
that these two methods were not clearly introduced as germane load associated factors. 
Especially the support for surface structure level in the format of textual links (syntactic 
support) was discussed has a confounding factor. On the one hand, a support to visually 
linking different representations should reduce split attention as an extraneous load-reducing 
factor; on the other hand, such a support is at the same time activating mapping processes as a 
germane load factor. This is what has to be considered as problematic within the cognitive 
load framework. It is a hint to the until now not really convincing differentiation of load 
types. The introduction of a well operationalized germane load factor can influence 
extraneous load as well. 
 
2.5 Other Important Issues Resulting from Cognitive Load Research   
Within the last decades of research on cognitive load, many interesting phenomena have been 
discovered and investigated, including numerous confirmations of effects of intrinsic, 
extraneous and germane load associated factors in the complex process of learning. The 
already mentioned overall influencing power of prior knowledge and the counterintuive 
Expertise Reversal Effect are two more important issues that will  be mentioned in the present 
work (see Section 2.5.1). In addition, two basic cognitive abilities that are especially required 
in multimedia learning are focused in this chapter: memory skills (see Section 2.5.2) and 
spatial ability (see Section 2.5.3). Finally, the variable time-on-task and its effect on several 
investigated effects will be discussed (see Section 2.5.4) in the present chapter. 
 
 
2.5.1 Prior Knowledge and the Expertise Reversal Effect 
The necessity to critically examine prior knowledge in multimedia learning research is one 
example of considering possible aptitude-treatment-interactions, which are interactions 
between learner characteristics and the given instructional conditions (Bétrancourt, 2005).  

 
38
High domain-specific prior knowledge facilitates summarizing the learning material into 
larger meaningful units and thereafter substantially reduces the number of units to be 
processed in working memory. Cognitive Load Theory derives from this argument the 
assumption that the risk of cognitive overload is lower for high prior knowledged than for low 
prior knowledged learners. High prior knowledged learners have enough cognitive resources 
free for an optimal mental organization of the learning material by falling back upon schemata 
stored in long-term memory. Thus, disadvantages of inappropriate instructional designs can 
be partly compensated. The application of diverse design principles like avoiding seductive 
details, using modality or introducing support for coherence formation should be especially 
effective for novices. 
This has been demonstrated by several studies, showing that learners’ domain-specific 
prior knowledge can moderate the effects of instructional support (e.g. Kalyuga et al., 1998; 
McNamara et al., 1996). Seufert (2003a) showed that support for coherence formation is 
especially effective for learners with medium levels of prior knowledge. She interprets this 
result in line with Cognitive Load Theory in the way that this group of learners is able to use 
at least some cognitive schemata, freeing up cognitive resources for coherence formation 
processes.  In contrast to experts, this learner group still needs support in the learning process. 
The research group around Sweller demonstrated that experts can even be hindered by 
instructional techniques, which normally foster learning, an effect called Expertise Reversal 
Effect (for an overview see Kalyuga, 2007; Kalyuga, Chandler, Tuovinen & Sweller, 2001). 
For instance, a study of Kalyuga et al. (1998) revealed that novice learners benefited from 
textual explanations integrated into diagrams. These learners were not able to comprehend the 
diagrams without explanations in an integrated format. However, with growing expertise 
learners performed significantly better without textual explanations. This is an expected 
result. However, learners with high prior knowledge remarkably performed worse with the 
integrated format. The authors explain the differential effects by the prevention of split-
attention or redundancy. Novices profit from instructions that prevent a split-attention effect 
by using integrated formats in order to avoid eye-movements that are time consuming and 
costly in terms of extraneous cognitive load. However, for experts these additional 
instructions are redundant to their own available schemata stored in long-term memory and 
activated in long-term working memory (Ericcson & Kintsch, 1995; see also Section 2.5.2) 
during learning. Experts could even get confused by the supplemental information and 
probably engaged in some sort of inhibition processes forcing the learner to select relevant 

 
39
information (Koch, Seufert & Brünken, 2008). For a graphical illustration of the special 
aptitude-treatment-interaction of an Expertise Reversal Effect, see Figure 2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 2. Illustration of a Special Aptitude-Treatment Interaction: The Expertise Reversal Effect. 
 
In another study, McNamara et al. (1996) demonstrated that an increase in text coherence was 
beneficial for novices, whereas experts benefited most from minimally coherent text. A recent 
study of Koch et al. (2008) also provides evidence for an aptitude-treatment interaction by 
Seufert (2003a), mentioned above, showing an expertise reversal effect in an instructional 
design to foster coherence formation. In this study, experts were hindered in deep processing 
by the verbally introduced support for coherence formation, which focused on the relations 
between visual and textual information of the multimedia learning material. However, this 
instructional technique was very fruitful for novices indicated by an interaction effect in 
transfer performance between prior knowledge, introduced as a continuous variable, and the 
instructional condition. Thus, the Expertise Reversal Effect for germane load associated 
factors of coherence formation is supported. For one of the other three relevant effects for the 
present work, namely modality, seductive details and mental animation, actual reviewed 
literature only presents studies confirming the expertise reversal effect in an instructional 
design to foster learning by using the advantages of modality. In a study of Kalyuaga, 
Chandler and Sweller (2000), learners with high prior knowledge actually compensated the 
disadvantages of a visual-only instruction. In a second experiment, experts demonstrated 
worse performance under the audiovisual instruction in comparison to the visual-only

condition. However, no expertise reversal effects were reported in literature for seductive 
details or mental animation. 
In sum, the expertise reversal effect is expected in instructional designs using the 
modality and/or the coherence effect. Further research is needed to confirm this phenomenon 
in other instructional techniques like reducing seductive details or activating mental 
animation. At this point, it can be concluded that prior knowledge plays a crucial role in 
multimedia learning, which should be taken into account by developing powerful pretests for 
every multimedia learning experiment. Moreover, practical implications should be sensible 
for counterintuitive effects of normally effective instructional designs. One solution are 
adaptive learning systems as already demonstrated in learning preference research, 
differentiating between verbalizers and visualizers (Leutner 2001; 2002), and demanded 
(Kalyuga, Ayres, Chandler & Sweller, 2003) as well as introduced (Kalyuga, 2006; Kalyuga 
& Sweller, 2005) in the context of expertise research in multimedia learning. 
The impact of prior knowledge has been widely analyzed, discussed and practical 
implications are already realized. The next chapter focuses on memory skills, which have 
recently been studied as another important and influencing learner characteristic in 
multimedia learning. 
 
 
2.5.2 Memory Skills 
Since the 1960s, cognitive researchers have been investigating the architecture of our 
cognitive system to understand the mechanisms managing complex tasks like language 
comprehension, learning and reasoning (Miller, 2003). A basis for the development of mental 
models is the multi-store model of Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968) introducing the serially 
organized sensory, short-term and long-term memory buffers which are responsible for 
information processing in general. Many studies followed to clarify how information is 
processed in short-term memory often times called working memory. The discussion about 
how working memory is organized is still on going, as this part of the memory system seems 
to be the bottleneck for processes in question. Different working memory models characterize 
the basis of this discussion over the decades, these models can be divided into three 
categories: hierarchical, distributed and sequentially organized models. One of the most cited 
and discussed hierarchical model is the working memory model of Baddeley and Hitch 
(1974), which proposes a central executive, managing information processes as a 
hierarchically independent component in working memory. This attentional-controlling 
system has two subsidiary systems, the phonological loop and the visuospatial sketchpad, 

 
41
which are both dependent of the central executive. Another model that was presented as an 
answer to the question “What kind of computer is man?” (Hunt, 1971, pp. 57) was the 
distributed memory model of Hunt (1971). This model claims that after words or pictures 
enter the sensory buffer, their physically coded representations are analyzed in intermediate 
buffers. Here, representations are recoded by means of relatively automatic programs and data 
stored in long-term memory. This model assumes that there are different levels of processing 
and includes interactions between long-term memory with its semantic networks and relations 
and the intermediate buffer with its storing and fetching processes of iconic data leading to 
the construction of process units. These units are then processed in conscious memory and 
stored in long-term memory. This distributed model anticipates sequentially organized models 
of working memory in the following decades as, for instance, integrated in Cognitive Theory 
of Multimedia Learning (CTML) of Mayer (2001b). This model explicitly refers to a 
sequentially organized processing and includes a dual-coding process by showing different 
ways of processing for pictorial and auditory information in working memory. 
All these models have two main assumptions in common, namely the active 
processing and the limited capacity assumption. These models support the idea that 
meaningful learning requires active processing by the learner and includes selection, 
organization and integration of information. In addition, this active process is limited by 
working memory capacity. Recent models also include the dual-channel assumption 
introduced by Pavios’ Dual-Coding Theory (1986) that differentiates between verbal and 
pictorial information processing in the way that abstract words only activate the verbal system 
in contrast to pictures or concrete and vivid words, which always activate the verbal as well as 
the imagery system. Thus, resulting from all these memory models, three memory factors 
could be highlighted as playing an important role in the context of learning: the content of 
long-term memory, the working memory capacity and memory strategy skills. 
The last chapter just summarized the tremendous power of long-term memory in 
learning this is the influence of prior knowledge on learning processes (see Section 2.5.1). 
A comparable powerful factor in multimedia learning is working memory. Seufert et 
al. (2009) assumed that learners with high levels of working memory capacity are more 
capable of storing and processing information from different representational formats, as it is 
often the case in multimedia learning. Therefore, it seems plausible that these learners should 
be able to compensate for the split of attention in visual-only learning material including 
textual and pictorial information. The tested modality effect in the mentioned study was 
indeed moderated by the level of memory capacity. In another study of Park et al. (2009) the 

 
42
learners with high levels of working memory capacity could not only compensate a seductive 
details effect of content-dependent background music in the learning material, but could even 
profit from this arousing condition, whereas learners with low levels of working memory 
capacity were inhibited in their learning process. A study of Sanchez and Wiley (2006) 
showed similar results. In a first experiment, low working memory capacity readers showed 
that they were especially vulnerable to the seductive details effect; the second experiment, 
using eye tracking methods, showed that these learners also attended more often to seductive 
details illustrations and for longer durations. Sanchez et al. (2006) concluded that learners 
with higher levels of working memory capacity are able to ignore irrelevant learning material 
and to guide their attention in a more efficient way, focusing on the contents relevant to 
achieve the learning goal. These findings support the ability-as-compensator hypothesis of 
Mayer (2001a) confirming that working memory capacity can moderate learning effects. It 
should be mentioned here that both studies referred to a special part or function of working 
memory distinguished by Ericcson and Kintsch (1995), Ericcson and Delaney (1999) as well 
as described by Sweller (2005a). The Long Term Working Memory (LTWM) is defined by 
regulating the processing and storing of information by retrieval cues activated in working 
memory and facilitating thereby the retrieval of relevant information of long-term memory. 
The third and last factor, which results from memory models and seems to be crucial 
in learning contexts are leaners’ memory strategy skills. Independent of their format, memory 
strategies could enhance working memory capacity. As was demonstrated by a study of 
McNamara and Scott (2001), learners’ performance on a working-memory task improved 
after strategy training for chaining words. 
To summarize, the two effects of seductive details and modality are supported by 
evidence of the moderating factor memory skills, including working memory capacity and/ or 
the efficient use of memory strategy. Further research is needed to confirm this moderating 
function in other domains. Perhaps, comparable moderating functions of memory skills could 
also be found for the support for coherence formation effect as well as for the mental 
animation effect that would be especially interesting for the present work. 
 
 
2.5.3 Spatial Ability 
The last factor, which is a focus of the present work as one of the marginal factors influencing 
multimedia learning, is spatial ability. The ability to select spatially complex information and 
to organize the internal represented information is very useful in learning tasks of spatially 
complex contents like biological or chemical processes. Spatial ability is especially important 

 
43
not only for structure information, but also for procedural information to reach a high level of 
performance. For instance, Seufert et al. (2009) showed that spatial ability is especially 
relevant for higher-order tasks in multimedia learning, such as comprehension and transfer. 
Due to the fact that different elements are necessary to be integrated into one spatial internally 
represented model, for which procedural information plays an important role. A positive 
effect of high spatial ability was found for comprehension and transfer performance, but not 
for recall, for which only single elements have to be recognized. Moreover, in this study 
investigating memory characteristics and modality in multimedia learning, spatial ability also 
turned out to correlate with both introduced memory characteristics, namely working memory 
capacity and memory strategy skills. This evidence suggests that all these measures can be 
seen as indicators of an overall intelligence factor. This is an argument for the well-known 
critiques from Spearman (1923) on differentiating between positive correlated subsidiary 
categories of intelligence as operationalized in intelligence tests. Typical for diagnosis are 
higher values in one of these categories intrinsic in the overall general factor of intelligence 
"g". However, to know about these details could at least give a hint for the direction where 
therapeutical measures should begin. Nevertheless, the identification of spatial ability as one 
of the most important component of human intelligence should be taken into account in the 
present work, as this factor is not only reflecting “processes of apprehending, encoding and 
mentally manipulating spatial forms” as defined by Carroll (1993, pp. 309), but also 
associated with general intelligence processes. The typical tasks used to measure spatial 
ability include imagining the result of spatial transformations, such as rotating an object or 
folding a piece of paper. A good performance in such tasks does not only predict an easy 
selection, organization and integration process of spatially complex contents, but could also 
predict success in mechanical occupations, mathematics, physics and medical professions 
(Hegarty & Waller, 2005) as spatial ability is correlated with all of these variables. 
To conclude, individual differences in spatial ability have been shown to be related to 
general intelligence processes as well as to working memory capacity or memory strategy 
skills. Interested in this context is the parallel of Baddeley’s working memory model (1986) 
with its subsidiary systems visuospatial sketchpad and phonological loop to the subscales 
visuospatial capacities and verbal capacities introduced in intelligence tests. Many activities 
such as playing chess and video games have been shown to use the visuospatial sketchpad, 
due to there use of visual imagery (Logie, 1995). These activities should be enhanced by the 
activity of multimedia learning and could be seen as a list of activities depending on general 
visuospatial capacity. 

 
44
From the direction of how to design multimedia instructions, the importance of spatial 
ability could be indirectly confirmed, as many studies show that spatial contiguity of related 
material is advantageous for multimedia learning. These studies indicate that the processes 
necessary for selecting, organizing and integrating elements of learning material are easier to 
activate when corresponding words and pictures are presented near rather than far from each 
other on the page or screen. This phenomenon leads to the spatial contiguity principle (Mayer, 
2001a), which instructional designer should take into account when constructing learning 
material. Learners’ spatial ability should not be the main performance-influencing factor in 
well-designed multimedia instructions, where spatial contiguity is regarded. However, spatial 
contiguity is no guarantee for a high instructional efficiency, as it is not sufficient for spatially 
complex learning contents. In this case, spatial ability is the much better predictor for a high 
level of task performance and learners’ should be supported by special instructions fostering 
spatial processing like mental animation by prediction tasks. As the ability to mentally 
animate is highly related to spatial ability (Hegarty et al., 1999; Sims et al., 1997), it could be 
assumed that learners with high spatial ability would mentally animate processed spatially 
complex information intuitively, while learners of low spatial ability should be instructed to 
do so. 
In sum, spatial ability seems to be an influencing factor in multimedia learning and 
should be regarded in every study investigating learning processes, especially when dealing 
with learning of spatially complex contents.  
 
 
2.5.4 Time-On-Task 
In cognitive research, the factor of time has a special function, as Kliegel, Mayr and Krampe 
(1994) describe by time-accuracy functions. The authors explain that these functions specify 
how much presentation time is needed to achieve a particular accuracy level. Two different 
time-accuracy functions based on negatively accelerated exponential functions in a diagram, 
where time is illustrated on the x-axis and correct response in percent is illustrated on the y-
axis, can help visualize different purposes. Imagine two of these functions showing one 
function where time-accuracy is reached very early (a very rapid rise of the exponential 
function) in contrast to one function with a slower rise. The rapid rising curve would reflect 
less resources-demanding performance because less time is needed to reach the same 
accuracy. Differences between these curves would illustrate the differences between two tasks 
due to the type or complexity of cognitive processing involved, the differences between two 
persons or groups due to characteristics such as ability, and the changes within a person or 

 
45
group due to learning or using a cognitive strategy, for instance. This paradigm developed by 
Kliegel et al. (1994) overcomes the traditional schism between performances assessed with 
latency and accuracy measures. This paradigm is especially useful in cognitive research, when 
minimalistic tasks in experimental conditions are introduced encompassing cognitive 
processes of scanning, episodic memory and figural reasoning. 
In complex learning, for example learning from a multimedia presentation which 
includes pictures and texts presenting process and structural information of the content to be 
learned, time is an important component of the learning process. However, there exist 
different ways to reach a certain level of performance in complex learning, and the qualitative 
aspect of learning would be disregarded by just relativating the performance by time-on-task. 
An attempt to illustrate the relation between time-on-task and performance could be realized 
by adapting the concept of instructional efficiency developed by Paas and van Merriënboer 
(1993). Learning instructions are highly efficient if high performance was reached by little 
mental effort. This concept could be enhanced by the assumption that efficient instructional 
design should evoke high performance and low time-on-task values. Thus, the higher the 
performance and the least amount of time-on-task, the more efficient the instructional design 
is. This relative condition efficiency could also be represented in a diagram categorizing 
instructional conditions into high and low efficient designs by using a formula for distance: E 
= │R-P│/ √2, whereas E stands for Efficiency, R for mental effort and P for performance. 
The R could be replaced by T for Time-on-task and the thereby developed T, P coordinate 
system illustrates categorized efficient instructional designs. 
However, by treating time-on-task as the only decisive variable to reject or adopt 
instructional designs for practical implications, would be a very hard criterion because the 
qualitative aspect of learning is not accounted for. In the case of the original instructional 
efficiency related to mental effort, the implication of Paas et al. (1993) is that multimedia 
designers should develop instructions, which engage the learner in conducive cognitive 
learning processes directing the learner to a higher learning outcome with minimal mental 
effort. However, Koch, Seufert and Brünken (2008) argue that this implication does not 
include the fact that complex learning sometimes needs deep processing which would produce 
a medium to high level of mental effort. This argument holds for time-on-task because deep 
processing sometimes needs more time. It is the goal of learning to reach a high level of 
understanding even when it is necessary to overcome some difficulties that are perhaps 
mentally more costly and time-consuming and also meaningful. This should be a new 
perspective on efficiency of instructional designs. 

 
46
In a self-paced instructional design, the decision about how to use time seems to be 
completely dependent on the learner. However, one aspect of time could be influenced by  
instructional designers that is time as an economic resource. With the construction of learning 
material, a time-related decision has to be made by presenting the material successively or 
simultaneously. This decision has consequences for learning as Mayer (2001a) reports from 
many studies confirming the temporal contiguity principle, which says that learners perform 
better when corresponding words and pictures are presented simultaneously rather than 
successively. This effect is found for complex learning material, but does not hold for 
material that is based on very short segments. Thus, time should also be taken into account 
from instructional designers as an economic resource, which could be used efficiently. 
In sum, time-on-task is one yet another factor, which influences complex learning 
especially when controlled by system-paced learning that seems to be an artificial condition, 
if the main interest is to investigate complex learning processes. This is why more and more 
experiments are driven under self-paced conditions and the interesting effects of multimedia 
research like for example the modality effect seem to disappear (Ginns, 2005). Some of the 
authors argue that this pacing effect could be due to the use of memory strategies like 
replaying or rehearsal (Harskamp, Mayer, & Suhre, 2007; Tabbers, 2002). A counter-
argument could be found in seductive details research where the phenomenon appears that 
even under self-paced condition the learners do not overcome the power of seductive details 
showing the highest time-on-task values in combination with significantly lower performance 
in contrast to learners who did not receive seductive details. Overall, the literature review 
confirms that there are more system-paced studies than self-paced studies and no systematic 
comparison by one material was realized until now. Thus, further research is needed to 
investigate the power of time-on-task. Learning time is only one component to describe the 
outcome and conclusions from the factor of time on task and  should be carefully drawn upon. 
However, it has already been concluded that time-on-task influences the learning process like 
prior knowledge, memory skills and spatial ability do. 
 
 
2.5.5 Resume and Conclusions 
The above selected factors: prior knowledge, memory skills, spatial ability, and time-on-task 
were described in order to prepare relevant issues for an examination of the additivity 
hypothesis of Cognitive Load Theory. Attention should be paid to all these factors in the 
operationalization phase of the studies of the present work. What could be concluded from the 
previous summary of these four factors is that they are related to each other. Imagine for 

 
47
example a learner with high spatial ability. This learner also would show certainly a high level 
in working memory skills at least for working memory tasks requiring processes associated 
with the visuospatial sketchpad and therefore would not need as much time to process 
spatially complex information in an efficient way. In contrast, we could assume that a learner 
with very low values on a spatial ability scale would not be as successful in working memory 
tasks requiring processes associated with the visuospatial sketchpad and would therefore need 
more time to select, organize and integrate spatially complex information. Thus, the overall 
influencing power of prior knowledge and the two basical cognitive abilities memory skills 
and spatial ability that are required in multimedia learning as well as the variable time-on-task 
have been highlighted in multimedia research as main covariables for studies investigating 
instructional designs. 
 
2.6 Different Methods of Measuring Cognitive Load 
Beside the analysis of parameters of knowledge acquisition as indirect indicators of cognitive 
load, the possibilities of a direct measurement of cognitive load during learning are discussed 
at present (Brünken et al., 2003; Paas et al., 2003, DeLeeuw et al., 2008). Different subjective 
and objective methods of appropriate indicators for cognitive load are established. One type 
of indicator are diverse subjective, often only on few items or even on one item based scales 
like self-reported invested mental effort, stress level or difficulty of material as especially 
introduced by the research group around Paas (for an overview see: Paas et al., 2003). 
Another type of indicator are objective methods of cognitive load measurement such as using 
the dual task paradigm, as successfully used in multimedia learning by Brünken’s research 
group (Brünken, Steinbacher, Plass, & Leutner, 2002; Brünken et al., 2003, 2004) and others 
(Chandler & Sweller, 1996; Marcus, Cooper & Sweller, 1996; Renkl, et al. 2003; van Gerven, 
Paas, van Merriënboer & Schmidt, 2002) or using physiological, behavioral or brain activity 
measures (Marshall, 2002a, 2002b; Marshall, Dickson & Pleydell-Pearce, 2003). As a rule, a 
close relation between these types of indicators and indicators of knowledge acquisition is 
observable. That means that learners who learned by using formats of information 
presentation that are superior for knowledge acquisition report or show a low level of 
cognitive load. This relation is plausible at first glance gives rise to many questions, which 
were not considered until now. Thus, a reduction of cognitive load is plausible in such 
instructional designs, which cause reduction of extraneous load (taking different modalities 
into account to prevent split-attention, for example). However, this is not predicted in designs, 
which cause an increase of germane cognitive load (support for coherence formation, for 

 
48
instance) because these designs should cause an increase in learning supportive cognitive load 
per definition. Occasionally, detailed analyses result in the discussion of which aspects of 
cognitive load do rating scales measure and thereafter uncover the lack of conceptional details 
(Paas et al., 2003). Until now a differentiating cognitive load rating scale has not been 
developed, measuring intrinsic, extraneous and germane load. Objective methods were also 
proved to illuminate special aspects of cognitive load. In the context of the dual-task 
paradigm the secondary tasks used until now are modality-sensitive and do not measure the 
sum of cognitive load, nor the sum of extraneous load, but the modality specific part (visual 
or acoustic) of cognitive load (Brünken et al., 2004). On a global level, there is clear empirical 
evidence for the relation between different cognitive load measures and instructional design 
of learning materials, but a detailed analysis of this relation has not been carried out until 
now. 
The present chapter introduces different measures of cognitive load referring to the 
classification of methods for measuring cognitive load based on objectivity and causal 
relation introduced by Brünken et al. (2003). This classification differentiates between 
subjective and objective methods, which are moreover described as indirect or direct 
measures. Brünken et al. (2003) mention different methods for each of the four categories. 
Self-reported invested mental effort is a subjective and indirect measure, while self-reported 
stress level and self-reported difficulty of materials are subjective but direct measures. In 
contrast, physiological measures, behavioral measures, and learning outcome measures are 
objective and indirect methods, while brain activity measures (e.g. fMRI) and dual-task 
performance are also objective but direct methods. This classification is useful to differentiate 
the frequently used as well as future methods in cognitive load research to be aware of their 
objectivity and causal relation. By classifying methods into these categories, different 
advantageous and disadvantageous aspects of each method can be underlined. This is also 
helpful, when having to choose the right method to conduct a study, as each of the mentioned 
methods is more appropriate for different experimental contexts such as laboratory-based 
experiments or classroom testing. 
After a summary of frequently used methods (see Section 2.6.1), this chapter 
continues with a discussion of future methods, which have not been introduced or intensively 
used in research on learning and instruction (see Section 2.6.2) resulting in future directions 
for further methodological research (see Section 2.6.3).

2.6.1 Frequently Used Methods for Measuring Cognitive Load  
The most frequently used methods for measuring cognitive load are based on the analysis of 
learning outcome measures or self-reported invested mental effort classified by Brünken et al. 
(2003) as indirect indicators of cognitive load. One example to analyze learning outcome 
measures is the use of transfer performance as an indicator for invested germane load. 
DeLeeuw et al. (2008) in their recently published study compared different measures of 
cognitive load that indicates evidence for separable measures of intrinsic, extraneous and 
germane load. As germane load is not induced by variation of the instructional design in this 
study, but only concluded by post hoc estimations based on transfer performance, this 
experimental design is not robust against confounds of cognitive load with other factors. 
Powerful factors, which can moderate performance in multimedia learning could also be prior 
knowledge, memory skills or spatial ability. In such a post hoc design no manipulation check 
is possible and it is questionable if this measure could really be an indicator of the level of 
germane load that is the invested by the learner. 
An example for the use of self-reported invested mental effort is given by a study of 
van Gog, Paas and van Merriënboer (2006) where effects of process-oriented worked 
examples on troubleshooting transfer performance were examined. The authors expected to 
confirm that learning with worked examples results in more effective learning indicated by 
higher transfer performance and less self-reported invested mental effort as well as less time-
on-task. Moreover, an interaction effect was hypothesized in the way that presenting process 
information leads to an increase in the investment of mental effort in both conditions, the 
worked example and the problem-solving condition, but resulted in different levels of transfer 
performance. In the worked example condition, the higher mental effort resulted in higher 
transfer performance indicating germane cognitive load which could only be interpreted as 
such because of the low extraneous loading condition. In contrast, in the high extraneous 
loading conventional problem-solving condition, the increase of mental effort resulted in 
reduction of transfer performance indicating in this case high extraneous load resulted from 
the problem-solving activity. With the indirect measure of overall mental effort as frequently 
used method in cognitive load research, which could be confirmed to be highly reliable (Paas 
et al., 2003), the hypotheses of this study could not be appropriately proven because this type 
of cognitive load measure do not differentiate between different load sources. The three 
sources of cognitive load in Cognitive Load Theory: intrinsic, extraneous and germane load 
result in a dynamic framework and therefore the combination of reached transfer performance 
and the self-reported invested overall mental load does not provide enough information for an 

 
50
interpretation of the dynamically acting load types. A lack of learning benefits, for instance, 
could stem from compensatory effects between germane and extraneous cognitive load, or 
between germane and intrinsic cognitive load or even from an overall cognitive overload 
indicating that the sum of intrinsic, extraneous and germane cognitive load exceeded the 
overall working memory capacity. This is only one example representing the limitations of 
cognitive load measures analyzed, reflected and discussed in more detail by Moreno (2006), 
which shows that this type of cognitive load measure is not adequate for a discriminating 
analysis of cognitive load effects. It is nevertheless one overall useful indicator of total 
cognitive load. 
When introducing this mental effort scale one should be aware of the subjectivity of 
measured cognitive load. Beside the well-known methodological problems of subjective 
ratings like the central tendency error or the phenomenon of social desirability or response 
behavior oriented at the expectations of the research team (Sassenberg & Kreutz, 1999). It is 
in general questionable if learners are able to estimate their invested mental effort as they do 
not feel when they are cognitively overloaded (Gimino, 2000). However, this is what is 
assumed by Paas and van Merrienboer referring to findings of Gopher and Braune (1984) that 
subjects are able to introspect on their cognitive processes and have “no difficulty in assigning 
numerical values to the imposed mental load”  (Paas & van Merriënboer, 1994, pp. 126). This 
is a main assumption when using this subjective mental load scale invented by Paas (1992). In 
addition, if learners were able to estimate their invested mental effort in a post-treatment 
questionnaire, it still would remain unclear, how this rated effort relates to actual cognitive 
load during the treatment. A low rated amount of invested mental effort could be on the one 
hand a result of low cognitive load, on the other hand a result of such a high load that the 
learner decreased the mental effort of comprehending the materials (Reed, Burton, & Kelly, 
1985). One more aspect that has to be considered is that in general a within-subject design 
should be recommended, especially for indirect and subjectively rated cognitive load, as it is 
also questionable, if it is possible to consider between-subjects differences on the same 
dimension as within subjects differences. 
These two frequently used methods of measuring cognitive load, the analysis of 
learning outcome measures and self-reported invested mental effort, are different in the way 
that performance measures are classified as an objective method and self-reported invested 
mental effort is classified as a subjective measure. Another comparable subjective measure is 
self-reported difficulty of materials that is associated with a direct measure of cognitive load. 
This could overcome the lack of information of other subjective measures mentioned by 

 
51
Brünken et al. (2003). However, all subjective measures mentioned here are perhaps 
confounded with each other as a rating of mental effort could be influenced by the 
participants’ feeling of stress level or arousal. We do not really know what participants 
estimate when answering on one item asking for the level of invested mental effort, stress or 
difficulty of material. This is the main counterargument to use one of the subjective methods 
of measuring cognitive load. The introduction of these methods should be considered very 
carefully and conclusions drawn from the overall estimation of cognitive load during learning 
should only concern this overall measured cognitive load. Specific hypothesis about different 
load types could not be tested by such operationalizations, which only include a general self-
reported cognitive load measure. In sum, internal validity of these subjective methods 
summarized here is questionable and post hoc interpretations of the objective method to 
measure some learning outcome is no solution, since powerful moderating variables are 
hardly controllable in the respective experimental design. 
More recently, possibilities to measure cognitive load in a direct way are focused and 
methods were developed and have empirical support. One example is the use of the dual-task 
paradigm that is normally utilized in research on executive functions measuring the capacity 
to switch between two comparably demanding tasks. This dual-task method is appropriate to 
examine general information processing of humans assuming that the management of two 
comparable tasks is dependent on cognitive organization, especially in working memory. In 
this part of human cognitive architecture, the rules of the two given tasks should be kept 
activated and some activation as well as inhibition processes are assumed to be located, 
relevant for successful switching between two tasks. In such a dual-task paradigm the above 
mentioned function of long-term working memory is also assumed to play an important role. 
The complete rule of one task has to be retrieved of the long-term memory at the right time, 
which could be organized more efficiently by a retrieval cue in long-term working memory. 
This dual-task paradigm has been adapted for complex learning situations where a primary 
task, the learning process, is accompanied by a less demanding secondary task that is sensible 
for measuring the level of cognitive load needed in the primary task. Numerous 
operationalizations were invented for a secondary task, which is slightly demanding, but not 
fully disrupting the execution of learning processes. For instance, the task to respond as soon 
as possible to a presented cue in the learning material, such as the color change of a letter 
presented on the margin of the screens or a simple auditory stimulus, was introduced in 
studies by Brünken (Brünken et al., 2002; Brünken et al., 2004). This type of method has also 
been used by other research groups (Chandler et al., 1996; Marcus et al., 1996). Yet is often 

 
52
criticized by its attracting function, splitting the attention of the learner who is at the time of 
the cue presentation reading a text or inspecting a picture in a multimedia presentation and 
really disrupted in the primary task. 
This clear disruption could be reduced by using changes in background color of the 
learning material (DeLeeuw et al., 2008), where no real disruption of the primary task is 
needed when the color is slightly changing over the complete viewing area. However, in this 
operationalization the learner will also be visually distracted in the moment of the color 
change. These methods could not really be classified as continuous one as described by 
Brünken et al. (2002) because learners are split in their attention as the visual secondary task 
is demanding resources from the visual primary task, when learning from a multimedia 
instruction including text and pictures or only pictures if the audio channel is used for text 
presentation. Thus, a sort of switching between the two tasks is necessary to overcome the 
demanding execution of both given tasks. However, registered reaction times of the secondary 
task highly correlated with indicators of knowledge acquisition. Learners who processed 
information from an instructional design, assumed to be superior for learning, produced 
shorter reaction times in the secondary task indicating a lower level of cognitive load. These 
objective methods are nevertheless problematic in the sense that only specific aspects of 
cognitive load are measured. 
This disadvantage is at the same time fruitful as it can be determined which aspect is 
measured by the secondary task because of its modality specific construction. These tasks 
thereafter do not registrate the overall invested mental effort neither do they measure the 
overall invested extraneous load, but a part of cognitive load which could be directly lead 
back to modality, that is the cognitive load due to visual or acoustic processing in working 
memory (Brünken et al., 2004). These modality specific cognitive load methods are 
introduced and proved by the mentioned studies of Brünken et al. (2002) using visual cues 
(color change of a letter) and Brünken et al. (2004) using acoustic cues (tone) in a secondary 
task of detecting the color change or the presentation of a tone. In both studies the modality 
effect could be confirmed in the patterns of the modality specific secondary task performances 
and in the primary learning task. Participants, who learned from audiovisual material had 
more capacities free for processing the visual secondary task than those working with the 
visual-only material (Brünken et al., 2002). In contrast, participants, who worked with 
audiovisual material had less capacities free for processing an acoustic secondary task than in 
the case of working with visual-only material (Brünken et al., 2004). 

 
53
In summary, the above mentioned frequently used methods for measuring cognitive 
load are useful instruments, but not as yet validly serving for a differentiation of the three 
components of cognitive load, namely intrinsic, extraneous and germane load. Thus, the 
theoretical construct to measure factors in cognitive load research studies should be carefully 
described. In addition, operationalizations should be clear and coherent with the introduced 
theoretical construct. One attempt to differentiate between the three cognitive load types has 
been recently realized by DeLeeuw et al. (2008) showing that some methods for measuring 
cognitive load are more adequate for one of the three load types. The results of a combination 
of three different methods for measuring cognitive load indicated that response time measure 
is most sensitive to manipulations of extraneous processing, ratings of invested mental effort 
are most sensitive to manipulations of intrinsic processing, and material difficulty ratings are 
most sensitive to indications of germane processing. However, there are some methodological 
limitations of this study. DeLeeuw et al. (2008) estimated the invested germane cognitive load 
by the observable transfer performance, which is not the best indicator for cognitive load as 
already discussed above. Moreover, it can not clearly be concluded from a low correlation 
between introduced methods of measuring cognitive load, namely dual-task, self-reported 
invested mental effort and performance measures that the overall cognitive load should 
therefore consist of different components. Thus, the resulting conclusion that for these 
different components the introduced methods are needed is very plausible, but still has to be 
confirmed in empirical studies which indeed induce the different load types. The only 
conclusion that could already be clearly drawn from this study is that some methods have a 
higher level of expressiveness for certain components of cognitive load. This is due to the 
specific construction of the respective invented instrument, as has been concluded by Brünken 
et al. (2004) and Ayres (2006). 
 
2.6.2 Discussion on Future Methods to Measure Cognitive Load  
The remaining methods for measuring cognitive load mentioned above in the classification of 
Brünken et al. (2003) based on objectivity and causal relationship (see p. 48) are objective 
measures such as brain activity, which is a direct method, as well as physiological and 
behavioral measures, which are indirect methods. Direct measures are not as frequently used 
due to the higher effort and funding needed to invest in such methods. The technology needed 
such as an fMRI or an eye-tracker instrument is moreover not as practical for certain learning 
situations such as classroom testing, for example. Considering the cost-benefit ratio of using 
such objective but time-consuming and expensive methods and the published confirmation of 

 
54
high reliability of the most frequently used cognitive load scale, it is clear why investigations 
rarely use direct methods. However, the method of using eye-tracking is recently trendy, seen 
through an ever increasing amount of eye-tracking studies (Jarodzka, Scheiter, Gerjets & Van 
Gog, 2010; Recarte & Nunes, 2003; Van Gog & Scheiter, 2010; Scheiter & van Gog, 2009), 
which was already shown to be an objective and useful measure in psychological studies in 
the sixties (Yarbus, 1967). 
The new technical possibilities now offer a more comfortable and cheaper instrument, 
which is not anymore demanding a series of prerequisites how the participant should be 
prepared for a correct measurement during learning. Today, the learner does not even need to 
wear glasses for eye-movement registration, because eye-movements are directly registered 
by the eye-tracker which is integrated in the monitor in front of the learner. Diverse 
publications show that the analysis of multidimensional data collected by eye-tracking is an 
objective measure, which leads to detailed process information of the learning process 
(Hunziker, 1970; Jarodzka et al., 2010; Recarte et al., 2003; Van Gog et al., 2010; Scheiter et 
al., 2009). An interesting idea in this context is to use eye-tracking visualizations of experts as 
an instructional method to support novice learners in their learning processes (Jarodzka, 
Scheiter, Gerjets & Gemballa, 2008). 
However, eye-tracking data do not directly represent mental effort, but a new 
enhanced method, the pupillometry, which takes the pupil dilation into account. As not only 
the eye-movement of a participant is observable during learning, but also the phenomenon of 
adaptive pupillometrical changes, cognitive load can be measured by changements of pupils. 
The used indicator is a defined pattern of little, short and cognitively related changes in the 
signal of pupils. The special pattern indicates a high amount of cognitive load and can be 
registered by an eye-tracker. This method is the more recent intervention presented by 
Schwalm, Keinath and Zimmer (2007) in a collaborative project between the research and 
intervention center of the BMW AG and the Saarland University. Here, not only the 
instruments, but also the technique of data analysis plays an important role in the realization 
of such a pupillometry study that is already established and often used in promotion studies. 
Schwalm et al. (2007) tested this method in the context of car-driving situations. The authors 
demonstrated that it is possible to identify mental effort by pupil dilation and represent this by 
the “Index of Cognitive Activity” (ICA, Marshall, 2002). In a study with lane change tasks, 
the ICA could identify situations where car drivers required higher mental effort, such as 
changing lanes or an additional secondary task. Similar results from research of another 
collaborative project between the QinetiQ, Ltd., the University of Bristol and the University 

 
55
of San Diego (Marshall, 2002a, 2002b; Marshall et al., 2003) present similarities between 
findings from EEG data and from pupil dilation data. This confirmation is very useful for 
studies in learning and instruction. The measurement of pupil dilation by eye-tracking 
instruments allows the experimenter to measure cognitive acitivity in the field for instance in 
a classroom setting. Marshall et al. (2002) recommend for future research to invest first in 
EEG studies indicating activity in various cortical regions in detailed laboratory studies, 
followed by field studies to validate the same phenomenon with the more general Index of 
Cognitive Activity. The use of pupil dilation as a more reliable and valid estimate of 
individual cognitive load is also recommended by Clark and Clark (2010) summarizing 
different methods of measuring cognitive load from a historical review. 
Another senseful approach is to develop secondary tasks measuring the overall 
cognitive load independent of modality and in a continuous way, in which Park and Brünken 
(2010) recently investigated. With the new method of an internal self-cuing secondary task, 
introduced by a rhythm-task, the continuous measure of cognitive load is possible. Learners 
are instructed to produce a certain rhythm by tapping a foot key registering the variances from 
the initially produced baseline of the given rhythm. The more the rhythm diverses from the 
baseline, the more the participant is involved in cognitive activities in primary task, the 
learning task. Another possibility to analyze these secondary task data is to registrate false 
sequences of the rhythm, which is chosen by its simplicity to guarantee that also learners 
without sense of rhythm are able to reproduce it. However, using this secondary task, the 
variable sense of rhythm should be tested in a pretest and controlled by a matching plan to 
prevent confounds. Nevertheless, the hypothesis that learners with a higher level of sense of 
rhythm do practice this secondary task in a more efficient way is questionable. It could also 
be that these learners are only paying another type of attention to this task because of their 
higher sensibility of correctness of their own rhythm production. Beyond that, an intra-
individual measure can be used by comparing the precision of the produced rhythm in the 
learning phase with a baseline, which was registered in the first minute of the learning phase 
or even before the learning lesson. Thus, the factor of sense of rhythm does not play an 
important role anymore. The intra-individual measure is moreover a solution for measuring 
intra-individually changing cognitive load during the whole learning lesson. This type of 
measuring cognitive load is also very useful because it is independent of modalities and 
manual management that is often involved in primary learning tasks such as pressing a key to 
get to the next screen or answering questions. This secondary task does not need external 
prompts, such as auditory or visual signals, because it has to be self-cued. The learner needs 

 
56
to manage the rhythm by himself. This provides the advantage of not disrupting the learner in 
the continuous process as the secondary task is continuous and independently managed. The 
disadvantage of reducing performance on the primary task like any other secondary task is 
still an argument to use one of the direct objective measures such as measuring brain activity 
or the just presented pupillometry. 
One more option to solve the problem of low sensitivity of learners is to allow them to 
estimate their own invested mental effort. The main difficulty of estimation stems from the 
abstract words, especially when translated into German language, when instructing the 
participants to estimate on a seven-point scale “By learning, my invested mental effort was 
…”. The confound is expanded with other abstract words like “motivation” or “arousal” or 
“performance” could be investigated by just presenting all these variables in one screen, 
showing that the estimation in these variables could be different at one time. The learners get 
conscious by this demanding task to estimate all three or even more confounding variables 
and therefore get specialized in estimating their invested mental effort.     
In closing, these presented new ideas of how to measure cognitive load by sensitive and valid 
methods should be understood as a creative hint to where research is already going and where 
new perspectives on cognitive load are needed. 
 
 
2.6.3 Future Directions for Further Methodological Research 
Methodological problems discussed above show that there is more research necessary to 
overcome not only the main problematic hypothesis of additivity of the three cognitive load 
types. Moreno (2006) has reflected and discussed studies with contradictory interpretations of 
worked-example effects coming to the fundamental question if Cognitive Load Theory is at 
an impasse or do “…our current methods do not allow us to appropriately test CLT?” (pp. 
177). She concluded that we should focus on the most challenging area within Cognitive Load 
Theory that is the development of “uniform operationalization and measurement of pivotal 
Cognitive Load Theory constructs such as mental effort, difficulty, expertise, prior 
knowledge, and the different types of cognitive load.” (pp. 178). This challenging area is 
focused in the present work by empirically examining the basic assumption of Cognitive Load 
Theory that the three load types are additive. Other mentioned relevant tasks to be solved in 
further cognitive load research such as methodological problems discussed deserve to be 
focused on in a separate report comparing different new methods or only rarely introduced in 
actual research especially the pupillometrical approach. 
 

 
57
2.7 Is Cognitive Load Theory at an Impasse? – A Critical Perspective 
Only by mentioning more critical literature, the review of literature is complete by asking the 
question if Cognitive Load Theory is at an impasse, which is a subtitle of an article from 
Moreno (2006) in the journal Learning and Instruction commenting on a special issue of 
contradicting worked-example studies edited by Paas and Van Gog (2006). Moreno (2006) 
concludes that reported findings for worked-example methods are mostly at odds with the 
predictions derived from Cognitive Load Theory and past cognitve load effects. For instance, 
van Gog et al. (2006) found a confirming effect that presenting process information increases 
cognitive load in contrast to only presenting product information. However, this increase in 
cognitive load was not asscociated with higher learning performance, raising the question if 
this activity was a source of germane cognitive load. Another study by Gerjets, Scheiter and 
Catrambone (2006) contradicts the hypothesis of Cognitive Load Theory that higher 
elaboration of instructional explanations increase germane cognitive load and learning. In this 
study contrasting findings were also found for the prediction derived from Cognitive Load 
Theory that prompting for self-explanations does affect learning from molar examples. In the 
study of Große and Renkl (2006), results show that prompting to write self-explanations can 
even have a negative effect on learning, while a learning effect of the presentation of multiple 
solutions was reversed between two reported experiments, which was partly explained by 
added extraneous load from the think-aloud method used in the second experiment. 
The critique Moreno (2006) offers with her commentary on the reported studies does 
not focus on contradicting results of each study, but on the way the authors argue with 
spectaculative post hoc interpretations. For example, the post hoc explanation of Große et al. 
(2006) that thinking aloud could increase extraneous load challenges the first hypothesis, that 
self-explanations are a source of germane cognitive load. The post hoc interpretation of van 
Gog et al. (2006) that the lack of an increase in learning when using cognitive load-increasing 
process information was due to the fact that the additional process information may have 
induced intrinsic cognitive load rather than the intedended germane cognitive load is just as 
problematic. Is the presentation of process information inducing germane or intrinsic 
cognitive load? Moreno raises in this context the question if Cognitive Load Theory can “help 
us answer this question and predict learning outcomes?” (2006, pp. 177). Also Gerjets et al. 
(2006) draw the conclusion that the unnecessity or the insufficient processing of the given 
additional information in the instruction is responsible for the first contradicting effect. 
However, this additional information was that more elaborated explanations originally 
assumed to foster learning as a germane load factor. The authors use a similar argument to 

 
58
explain the lack of a positive self-explanation effect on learning from molar examples by the 
conclusion that self-explanations may have produced a redundancy or a split-attention effect. 
Both effects being associated with the design and therefore with extraneous cognitive load. In 
summary, Moreno concludes that these speculative post hoc interpretations “leave us with 
more questions than answers and cast doubt over the validity of CLT” (2006, pp. 177). The 
variation of interpreations should make us wonder if Cognitive Load Theory is at an impasse. 
Moreover, all studies reported here used the subjective rating scale of Paas (1992) and the 
question in this context arises if this method allows appropriately testing Cognitive Load 
Theory. 
Another recent example is the result of an expertise reversal effect in a study testing an 
instruction to foster coherence formation (Koch et al., 2008). One could argue that the 
normally appearing coherence effect of the introduced verbal support for coherence formation 
turns into a redundancy effect and this argument is nothing else than the transformation of a 
germane load factor into an extraneous load factor. By such reversals of load types Cognitive 
Load Theory becomes a very dynamic framework that seems to be so flexible that any result 
could be explained with real cognitive load arguments running away from the clear 
hypothesis driven concept into a labyrinth full of explanations for every learning behavior. 
This is what differentiates a clear theory that could be confirmed or not from a framework just 
explaining everything. This fundamental critique is the foundation of the present work testing 
the additivity hypothesis of Cognitive Load Theory. 
Another interesting view from Schnotz and Kürschner (2007) should be mentioned 
here as an aspect of Cognitive Load Theory, appearing by reviewing recent cognitive load 
studies on expertise and task difficulty. The authors conclude by their reconsideration of 
Cognitive Load Theory that it is sometimes necessary to “increase intrinsic cognitive load in 
order to create an adequate alignment of learner expertise and learning task difficulty” 
(Schnotz et al., 2007, pp. 486), instead of focusing only on reduction of extraneous cognitive 
load according to the classical view of Cognitive Load Theory. The previously not variable 
recognized intrinsic cognitive load now turns into an important and flexible construct that is 
even associated with Vygotski’s (1963) Zone of Proximal Development. The authors 
conclude that any instruction, which aims at promoting learning should include learning tasks 
within the limits of the Zone of Proximal Development. If task difficulty is higher than the 
actual Zone of Proximal Development of a certain learner, his or her cognitive capacity would 
be overwhelmed because of exceeding working memory capacity. In contrast, if task 
difficulty is lower than the actual Zone of Proximal Development, the learner would not be 

 
59
activated resulting in unused, but available cognitve capacities. Therefore, choosing other 
tasks or another difficulty level of the same task would be a solution to foster appropriate 
activation processes of the learner that are within the Zone of Proximal Development. The 
comparison of Schnotz et al. (2007) between the concept of Vygotski’s Zone of Proximal 
Development and intrinsic cognitive load is useful in its resulting logical consequences 
demanding instructional designers to not only reduce extraneous load, but also manipulate 
intrinsic cogntive load to guarantee an adequate alignment of learner expertise and task 
difficulty. 
However, the question arises if the Zone of Proximal Development could be reduced 
to the learner’s level of expertise. What about germane load? The authors conclude that it is 
the “combination of germane load and intrinsic load rather than the germane load alone, 
which allows predicting learning outcomes from germane load activities.” (Schnotz et al., 
2007, pp. 498). By these ideas, it could be assumed that germane load is related to the Zone of 
Proximal Development, but no assumption about this relation is given. Perhaps, the 
comparison of Vygotski’s Zone of Proximal Development should be enhanced by all load 
types, as they are related to each other and the overall cognitive load describes the use of 
available memory capacity, being the bottleneck of all learning activities, which could be 
within the limits of the Zone of Proximal Development. A certain task with its task difficulty 
level (intrinsic load) presented by a certain presentation format (extraneous load) including 
certain learning fostering prompts (germane load) could be within the Zone of Proximal 
Development of a learner or not. Is it not possible that not only task difficulty, but also a 
certain presentation format and/or a certain normally learning-enhancing prompting could 
exceed the learners Zone of Proximal Development? This zone is defined by the range 
between a lower limit of task difficulty, represented by tasks that learners are able to solve on 
their own without any additional instruction, and an upper limit of task difficulty, represented 
by tasks that learners are able to solve with additional instruction. Thus, Vygotski (1963) 
refers to the overall requirement of solving a task in his definition including the task 
presentation as well as additional instructions and not only the task difficulty. However, the 
comparison of these two concepts explains how learners are best engaged in the learning 
process offers a critical look at the diverse contexts of Cognitive Load Theory. 
In sum, critical perspectives presented here show that Cognitive Load Theory still 
needs to be developed to become a clearly defined and falsifiable theoretical construct, not 
simply a framework at its impasse.

2.8 The Cognitive Load Construct and its Relation to Other Recent Constructs 
Explaining Phenomena of Learning and Instruction 
The last chapter introduced useful psychological concepts like the Zone of Proximal 
Development (Vygotski, 1963), which can explain learning effects that are associated with 
cognitive load. In this chapter other theories dealing with alternative plausible concepts which 
can explain phemomena of cognitive processes during learning are briefly summarized to get 
an idea of how the cognitive load construct is connected to other recent cognitive constructs 
and aspects such as affect and arousal. 
The competing Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2001b, 2005b) is 
often used in research on learning and instruction and is based on three assumptions which are 
partly associated with the three basic assumptions of Cognitive Load Theory. The first 
assumption, which is a main assumption for many cognitive theories summarizes that human 
working memory, the cognitive subsystem for processing current information, is limited in its 
capacity for processing (Baddeley, 1986; Chandler et al., 1991; Miyake et al., 1999). The 
second assumption Mayer (2001) offers is that meaningful learning requires active processing 
of information by the learner. Active processing in turn requires cognitive processes such as 
focusing the attention on the relevant learning content (selection), mentally organizing 
information in a coherent way (organization) and intergrating new information with existing 
knowledge (integration). These three cognitive processes result in the SOI-model (Mayer, 
1992) summarizing active processing of an engaged learner. The last assumption of the 
Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning is the dual channel assumption, which is derived 
from the Dual-Coding Theory of Paivio (1986) describing two channels of information 
processing. Verbal information, a spoken text for example, is processed in the verbal channel, 
while pictorial information, a picture or diagram for instance, is processed via the visual 
channel. Beyond that, limited capacity is assumed for each channel. Mayer (2001b) purports 
that active processing of pictures and words begins with the perception of these external 
representations via sensory memory. The selection of relevant information starts after that in 
the working memory,  resulting in pictorial or verbal mental models based on an organization 
process. These internal representations are integrated by an active integration process to a 
coherent mental model and are stored in long-term memory. The Cognitive Theory of 
Multimedia Learning was developed with the goal to create a plausible theoretical construct, 
which is consistent with known principles of research on learning and instruction. Moreover, 
it is possible to empirically test hypotheses, which can be derived from this theory. This is 
what Mayer successfully showed in his first handbook of Multimedia Learning (2001a) and 

 
61
what has been enhanced by other researchers and their studies in the second handbook 
(2005a). 
Mayer’s theory focuses on meaningful learning and the processes which are necessary 
to achieve a constructive mental process, whereas the main interest of Cogntive Load Theory 
is to know about how instructions should be designed to efficiently support complex 
knowledge acquisition. As already mentioned in the introduction (see Chapter 1), it is 
possible to ask about cost-benefit proportions in learning situations, when the additional 
information about the invested mental effort while learning is available. Cognitive Load 
Theory does this by focusing on identifying efficient instructional designs for different learner 
characteristics. Both cognitive theories build an excellent background for research on learning 
and instruction and can be used in combination to explain diverse phenomena in the research 
field. However, both do not integrate motivational and affective aspects. Two theories should 
be mentioned in this context, the recent developed Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning 
with Media (Moreno, 2006) and the much older Arousal Theory. 
Moreno (2006) enhances the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning by three 
additional main assumptions resulting in the Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with 
Media. The assumptions of affective mediation, metacognitive mediation and individual 
differences. These assumptions focus on self-regulatory effects during learning as well as on 
individual differences prior to learning. In addition, to independent information processing in 
a verbal and a non-verbal channel that requires conscious effort in selecting, organizing and 
integrating new information with existing knowledge under a limited working memory 
capacity condition, these processes can be mediated by affects or metacognition. Moreno 
(2006) refers to the idea that motivational factors can mediate learning by increasing or 
decreasing cognitive engagement (Gottfried, 1990) and to the idea that metacognitive factors 
mediate learning by their regulatory function, managing cognitive processing and affect 
(McGuinness, 1990; Morris, 1990). In contrast to these more flexible factors, the individual 
differences assumption refers to factors that are much more stable and measurable before 
learning like prior knowledge and traits such as cognitive styles and abilities, which may 
affect how much a learner learns with specific methods and media. All three of these 
assumptions should be considered in future research on learning and instruction. 
These assumptions could also be considered for Cognitive Load Theory, as 
motivational and metacognitive factors influence cognitive load increasing or decreasing the 
overall load depending on the level and the type of motivation or metacognition. 
Metacognition could be classified as a typical germane load factor, as well-organized 

 
62
metacognitive thoughts possibly prompted by metacognitive thoughts such as “What do I 
have to do?”, “What resources do I have?”, “What do I want to learn?” or “How  do I to 
proceed? How long will it take?” (Bannert, 2006) activate the learner to invest in learning 
processes. Metacognition is especially effective in highly complex learning material like 
hypermedia (Bannert, 2003, 2004a, 2004b, 2006). Similarly, motivation could be associated 
with germane cognitive load, as a high level of motivation fosters learner to invest in deep 
learning processes. Hypotheses deriving from Cognitive Load Theory and from the Cognitive 
Theory of Multimedia Learning could however be reversed by taking the mediation effects of 
motivation, metacognition or individual differences into account. For instance, the coherence 
principle, which leads to the assumption that seductive details affect learning in a negative 
way by increasing extraneous cognitive load and distracting from or disrupting relevant 
learning processes results in a low learning outcome, could be reversed, if seductive details 
become a motivating tool for learners with high working memory capacities (individual 
differences assumption). To look deeper into these variables of affects and motivation, the 
Arousal Theory could present information on how these mechanisms could influence learning 
in an environment  constantly running and changing. 
The Arousal Theory is based on the Yerkes-Dodson Law (Yerkes & Dodson, 1908), 
which is traditionnally interpreted as a summary of the complex empirical relation between 
arousal and performance (Hebb, 1955). The efficiency of performance is an inverted u-shaped 
function of arousal. This means that performance increases with increasing arousal until a 
certain optimal arousal level and decreases with higher arousal levels than this optimal 
medium arousal level. Yerkes-Dodson Law describes this relation depending on task 
difficulty: the lower the task difficulty, the higher the optimal medium arousal level. 
Considerable evidence exists for the Yerkes-Dodson Law (Anderson, Revelle & Lynch, 1989; 
Broadhurst, 1959; Duffy, 1962; Hebb, 1955; Humphreys & Revelle, 1984). A learning 
condition that increases the arousal level to the optimal level according to task difficulty 
would increase learners’ attention in the way that more information could be processed. The 
retention, comprehension and transfer performance (Dewey, 1913; Renninger, Hidi & Krapp, 
1992) therefore would also increase. In contrast to Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning 
and Cognitive Load Theory, the hypothesis derived from Arousal Theory concerning effects 
of seductive details summarize additional elements such as content-related background music 
(Park et al., 2009) or attention calling pictures or animations as fruitful, learning-fostering 
instructional elements which arouse interest of the learner for the relevant learning content. In 
the area of media research, a series of investigations on the relation between attention and 

 
63
comprehension performance (Collins, 1982; Kozma, 1991) led to the quintessence that visual 
attention of television viewers is periodically attracted by salient auditory cues and sustained 
by significance and meaningfulness of the presented content (Kozma, 1991). Moreno und 
Mayer (2000) conclude from this research that auditory information presented additional 
elements and that these elements do not only activate and sustain attention, but also serve in 
the selection of relevant information for further processing. Additional interesting elements in 
learning environments should indirectly foster working memory processes in a positive way, 
as they raise the general arousal (Weiner, 1990), which should be sufficient for an increase of 
performance according to Arousal Theory. 
The basic conclusion that a generally higher arousal is sufficient to increase 
performance is at the same time one of the limitations of Arousal Theory. The theory fails to 
account for differences in stimulus value, which could determine which task or situations are 
most arousing. Arousal Theory does not include any assumptions about individual 
differences, for example music could arouse one learner in a positive way, but distract another 
learner. Finally the concept of arousal itself is in some ways problematic, as it is normally a 
within-subject variable that is “one of phase differences in the diurnal rhythm rather than a 
difference in chronic arousal, as previously postulated” (Revelle, Humphreys, Simon, & 
Gilliland, 1980, pp. 26). It could be seen as a variable in the course of a learning session, 
where arousal could range from extreme sleepiness to extreme excitement. Within-subject 
increases in arousal can be measured by heart rate, breathing rate, number of spontaneous 
galvanic skin reponses (GSRs), increases in skin conductance, and increases in the dominant 
electroencephalogram (EEC) frequency (Revelle et al., 1980), which are all physiological 
measures associated with the above mentioned indirect and objective methods for measuring 
cognitive load (see Chapter 2.6). It is obvious that both constructs arousal and cognitive load 
have something to do with each other. So, how are the constructs arousal and cognitive load 
related to each other? – Are these constructs just confounded or even one and the same thing 
or do we use inappropriate methods for different constructs? Other methods to measure 
arousal are assessing within-subjects differences by self-reports (Kjellberg & Bohlin, 1974; 
Thayer, 1967), which were interestingly found to correlate more with the physiological 
indicators than any two indicators correlated with each other (Clements, Hafer & Vermillion, 
1976). Revelle et al. (1980) raise the question by reporting these studies if it is possible to 
consider between-subjects differences on the same dimension as within subjects differences. 
This is a good question with respect to the often used cognitive load scale. That is, 
within subjects, a learner is more cognitively loaded with the self-reported 80 % than with 

 
64
self-reported 40 % of the estimated overall load. However, is someone more cognitively 
loaded with self-reported 80 % than someone else is with self-reported 40 %? The Arousal 
Theory seems to be problematic at the same point as Cognitive Load Theory that the type of 
arousal or load could be decisive for effects on cognitive processes. As this qualitative aspect 
of both constructs is not sufficiently determined by the theories, it is almost impossible to 
develop an appropriate differentiating method for measuring the type of arousal or the type of 
load. Thus, both theories can only refer to general arousal or total cognitive load. However, as 
research on arousal progresses, it became clear that the original conceptualization of a 
unidimensional arousal continuum had to be modified to a multidimensional model (Thayer, 
1976) resulting in differentiating methods measuring arousal such as the activation-
deactivation adjective check list (Thayer, 1976, 1978a, 1978b). This could be a hint for 
further research on cognitive load and the development of multidimensional methods 
measuring different cognitive load dimensions. 
 
2.9 Resume 
The theoretical background and review of literature demonstrates that learning phenomena 
can not be sufficiently described by Cognitive Load Theory and is not as simple as the 
plausible Cognitive Load Theory assumptions suppose (see Chapter 2.1). There are many 
influencing factors that have to be considered when argumenting in line with cognitive load 
ideas. However, it can be summarized that research on cognitive load is based on a broad 
foundation of empirical studies for the instructional application of cognitive load principles. 
There is strong evidence for the extent of utility of Cognitive Load Theory as an education 
psychological framework. Nevertheless, the assumptions of this theortical farmework still 
need to be empirically analyzed to determine the specific mechanisms within Cognitive Load 
Theory. One of these theoretical assumptions, the present work attends to, is the additivity 
hypothesis of Cognitive Load Theory. 
The review of research on intrinsic cognitive load (see Chapter 2.2) shows that this 
load type, previously thought to be fix and not manipulable, has been recently investigated. In 
contrast, the review of research on extraneous cognitive load (see Chapter 2.3) shows that this 
factor has been analyzed in cognitive load research. One of the most investigated extraneous 
load effects is the modality effect. The second extraneous cognitive load effect described in 
detail is one of the most relevant for practical implications, the seductive details effect. The 
general conclusion that could be drawn from these effects is that it is indeed possible to 
reduce overall cognitive load by considering some instructional principles like omitting 

 
65
seductive details or integrating different modalities in order to facilitate schema construction 
and automation. The question now arises if these single effects are cumulative in the way that 
a higher amount of reduction could be achieved by for example an audiovisual version 
without seductive details in contrast to a visual-only version including seductive details. 
The examples of methods to induce germane load associated learning activities such as 
coherence formation or mental animation (see Chapter 2.4) illustrate the most learner-oriented 
investments in the framework of Cognitive Load Theory. As this research endeavor focuses 
on the development of learning instructions that animate the learner to invest in performance-
enhancing activities. Research on germane load is associated with constructivism, as 
researchers are forced to reconsider the active role of the learner in the learning process 
(Valcke, 2002). The general conclusion that could be drawn from the presented germane load 
effects is that it is indeed possible to animate learners’ to invest in schema construction and 
automation by very simple instructional tools like articulating predictions, answering 
questions or mapping tasks. The question now arises if these single effects are cumulative in 
the way that a higher amount of increase in the learning outcome could be achieved by for 
example a mental animation condition including support for coherence formation in contrast 
to a minimalistic design of the learning environment without any germane load associated 
prompts. 
Other important issues resulting from cognitive load research (see Chapter 2.5) were 
focused, which are in detail the four aspects: prior knowledge, memory skills, spatial ability 
and time-on-task (see Section 2.5.1-2.5.4). These four relevant factors represent only a part of 
possible influencing factors in learning processes supposed to result in higher knowledge 
acquisition under a certain cognitive load level. These factors should be paid attention to in 
the operationalization phase of all studies of the present work. 
In addition, different methods of mearsuring cognitive load were discussed (see 
Chapter 2.6), illustrating the field of how to measure cognitive load and how to differentiate 
between the three load types on a methodological level. The resulting conclusion, which 
Moreno (2006) drew, is the question if “…our current methods do not allow us to 
appropriately test CLT?” (pp. 177). Thus, we should focus on a challenging area within 
Cognitive Load Theory that is the development of “uniform operationalization and 
measurement of pivotal Cognitive Load Theory constructs such as mental effort, difficulty, 
expertise, prior knowledge, and the different types of cognitive load.” (Moreno, pp. 178). This 
challenging area is a focus in the present work by empirically examining the basic assumption 
of Cognitive Load Theory that the three load types are additive. Other mentioned relevant 

 
66
tasks to be solved in further cognitive load research like the methodological problems 
discussed above will be the  focus of  separate report comparing different methods. 
From the review of critical literature (see Chapter 2.7 and 2.8) arises the question if 
Cognitive Load Theory is at an impasse and summarizes briefly some alternative theories 
dealing with other plausible concepts like the Zone of Proximal Development, the Cognitive 
Theory of Multimedia Learning, the Cognitive-Affective Theory of Learning with Media and 
the Arousal Theory. Cognitive Load Theory is a good framework especially interested in cost-
benefit proportions during learning and focuses on identifying efficient instructional designs 
considering different learner characteristics. However, the learning efficiency evaluated by 
cognitive load effects still fail to integrate the concept of motivation, affect and/or arousal, 
which seem to be variables that influence learning situations. It is highly recommended that 
further investigations should foucs on integrative processing and their possible consequences 
for learning and instruction.

3. Statement of the Problem  
This portion of the present paper illustrates the problem statement derived from the theoretical 
background and summarizes the aims and the work schedule of the present work. The first 
part (see Chapter 3.1) briefly illuminates the goal of the three 2 x 2 factorial studies derived 
from Cognitive Load Theory in order to test the additivity hypothesis. After that, the second 
part (see Chapter 3.2) describes the concrete work schedule used to realize the present work. 
For each planned experiment, experimental designs as well as expected effects are illustrated. 
 
3.1 Aims 
The goal of the present work is to empirically examine the additivity hypothesis of the 
Cognitive Load Theory. This will be done with three experiments, each of them a 2 x 2 
factorial design to examine the effect of combinations of cognitive load effects on extraneous 
load (Experiment 1), extraneous and germane load (Experiment 2) and germane load 
(Experiment 3). All three experiments ask for the combined effect of each two instructional 
condition variations on knowledge acquisition as well as on cognitive load. 
This differentiation of a separate examination of extraneous and germane load effects 
as well as the analysis of knowledge acquisition and cognitive load are necessary, as the 
additivity hypothesis leads to different hypotheses with regard to the effect of different 
instructional optimizing measures on knowledge acquisition and cognitive load depending on 
the load type. Both load types, extraneous and germane load should lead to a support of 
knowledge acquisition, while the optimization of extraneous load leads to a reduction of 
cognitive load, the optimization of germane load should lead to a higher level of cognitive 
load (see Table 2).

As it remains unclear, how subjective estimation of cognitive load (by questionnaire) and 
objective measurement of load (by dual-task methods) are related, in all experiments the 
cognitive load should be measured by both methods. However, this goes beyond the scope of 
the present work. Thus, the three introduced experiments include subjective rating of 
cognitive load as a posttest questionnaire. In order to increase internal validity, some process 
information of cognitive load will be measured by introducing subjective rating questions 
during learning as well as posttest. Studies with this type of process measurement could show 
considerably differential effects (Zander & Brünken, 2006a, 2006b). This online measurement 
is realized by automatically presented prompts during the learning phase. It includes the 
frequently used scale of Paas et al. (1994), which is introduced as a global scale as well as a 
differential instrument measuring the three load types. 
The realization of this experimental design requires instructional measures that 
optimize cognitive load, are proven to be empirically stable in a single examination and are fit 
together in a meaningful learning system. Of numerous publicated effects (for an oberview 
see for example Mayer, 2005a; Mayer, 2001a; Mayer et al., 2003; Clark et al., 2003), the 
following effects were selected fulfilling both criteria: the modality effect (Brünken et al., 
2001; Mayer et al., 1998), the seductive details effect (Brünken et al., 2001; Mayer & Gallini, 
1990), the support for coherence formation effect (Bodemer et al., 2004; Brünken et al., 2005; 
Koch et al., 2008; Seufert, 2003a, 2003b; Seufert et al., 2004, 2006, 2007) and the mental 
animation effect (Bétrancourt, 2005; Hegarty et al., 2003; Münzer, Seufert, Plass & Brünken, 
2009). In addition, four preliminary single effect studies were conducted to prove learning 
effects of all four chosen factors (see Chapter 4.5). 
 
3.2 Work Schedule  
The following parts describe the concrete work schedule used to realize the present work. For 
each of the three planned experiments, experimental designs as well as expected effects are 
illustrated. 
 
 
3.2.1 Experiment 1: Combined Variation of Two Extraneous Load Factors 
Research Question and Hypotheses. The first experiment raises the question of how the 
combination of two instructional measures, each leading to reduction of extraneous load, is 
inducing an additive effect regarding knowledge acquisition and cognitive load as predicted 
by Cognitive Load Theory. Multimedia learning materials are used that are variable in their 
modality (modality effect: audiovisual vs. visual-only version) and its integration of 

 
69
interesting, but not learning enhancing information (seductive details effect: with vs. without 
seductive details version). 
It is expected that the combination of the two load-reducing versions (audiovisual and 
without seductive details) will positively affect knowledge acquisition moreso than the sole 
presentation of one of both load-reducing instructions (audiovisual or without seductive 
details). The latter instructional versions should furthermore be superior to a learning material 
presentation of two suboptimal presentation conditions (visual-only with seductive details). In 
addition, no systematic differences are expected regarding the comparison of both groups 
with only one load-reduced presentation condition. Mayer (Mayer, 1997; 2001a) confirmed 
on the basis of numerous studies for both effects medium (related to factual knowledge) and 
high effect sizes (related to transfer tasks). Thus, comparable single effects can be assumed. 
Regarding cognitive load, the lowest load is expected by taking both effects concurrently into 
account. A much higher load is expected, when only one positive effect is considered and the 
highest load is assumed, when no positive effects, but two suboptimal aspects are introduced 
in the design of the learning environment (see Table 3).

Methods and Design. An experimental design, a 2 x 2 factorial design, was chosen with the 
two independent variables modality of information presentation (audiovisual vs. visual-only) 
and seductive details (with vs. without). This leads to four different instructional conditions of 
the learning material:

Because of the expected medium to high effect of the condition variation on knowledge 
acquisition (Mayer, 2001a) as well as on cognitive load (Brünken et al., 2002), a sample of N 
= 100 (25 participants per group) was sampled. This group size is approriate for statistical 
validation of main and interaction effects within the framework of variance analysis. The 
study is conducted in diverse computer rooms of eight high schools of Saarland. Participants 
are volunteers and get payed for their participation. They are tested in groups and encouraged 
to learn by receiving a higher fee (10 Euro instead of 8 Euro), if the protocol of their 

 
71
computer confirms their good performance. This has to be checked by the instructor after the 
session by opening the protocol of answered post test items with open response format. A 
high amount of answered questions indicates the motivation of the participant to invest in the 
post test and to reach a high performance. Thus, participants showing a high amount of 
answered open formatted questions immediatly get the higher fee. Participants, who show no 
answers to these open-ended questions, also get the higher fee, but with the comment that this 
was not their best performance and that we bent the rules in this case. 
Knowledge acquisition and cognitive load are collected as dependent variables. 
Referring to Mayer (1997; 2001a), knowledge acquisition is moreover subdivided into 
retention, transfer and problem solving performance. Prior knowledge tested by a pretest and 
spatial ability tested by a paper folding and a rotation test as well as time-on-task registered 
during the learning phase serve as control variables. 
Subjective rating of cognitive load is measured by Paas’s scale (Paas et al., 1994). The 
rating is arranged as one online measure during the learning phase and as a posttest, given 
immediately after the learning phase. 
The subject of the computer-based learning material is the structure and function of a 
cellular molecule, the ATP-Synthase. This molecule is responsible for the synthesis of ATP, 
for energizing cell processes. The learning material is composed by 11 pages comprising of 
text and corresponding static pictures on each page. The learning task is to understand the 
complex structure and function of the molecule. Therefore, learners have to imagine rotations 
and movements within this complex spatial building and have to integrate the given textual 
and pictorial information. The operationalization of the modality effect is realized by the 
option that the given text could be presented in a visual-only format (written text part) or in an 
auditive way (read by a professional narrator). The navigation through the learning program is 
organized by buttons, which only go in one direction to the next learning screen. The 
navigational button appears in all versions of the learning program only after a certain period 
of time, which is necessary for a single turn of the audio-text presented by the professional 
narrator. In the auditive version, participants are able to regulate the sound volume. After the 
presentation of the learning content, participants receive a computer-based factual knowledge 
test in the format of multiple choice questions and mapping tasks as well as some 
comprehension and transfer tasks including open response formats. Also after this posttest, 
participants rate their cognitive load experienced during the posttest. 

 
72
Two previous studies confirm both single effects, the seductive details effect as well as 
the modality effect with the present learning material (see Chapter 4.5). Testing the effect of a 
combination of these two effects is the goal of the present work. 
 
 
3.2.2 Experiment 2:Combined Variation of Extraneous & Germane Load Factors 
Research Question and Hypotheses. The second experiment seeks to answer the question of 
which effect does the combination of an instructional measure to reduce extraneous load 
(modality effect) and an instructional measure to foster germane load (support for coherence 
formation) have on knowledge acquisition and cognitive load. As in the first experiment, it is 
expected that the combination of two load-optimizing measures will affect knowledge 
acquisition in a positive way. An additive effect is assumed in contrast to the introduction of 
only one load-optimizing measure. However, regarding congitive load another effect pattern 
is expected than described for the first experiment. While the implementation of an 
extraneous load reducing measure should reduce the overall cognitive load, an 
implementation of a measure to foster germane load should invovle an overall higher 
cognitive load, even though it is expected to foster knowledge acquisition. 
Therefore, the combination of both measures should result in a differential effect 
pattern as illustrated in Table 5:  
 
Table 5. Expected Effects of Different Instructional Measures for an Optimization of 
Extraneous and Germane Load on Total Cognitive Load

In contrast to the first experiment no linear relation should be assumed between knowledge 
acquisition and cognitive load. Figure 4 depicts the expected relation:

Methods and Design. An experimental design, a 2 x 2 factorial design, is selected as in the 
first experiment. The two independent variables modality of information presentation 
(audiovisual vs. visual-only) introduced as extraneous load factor and support for coherence 
formation (with vs. without) as germane load factor are varied. This leads to the following 
four instructional conditions of the learning material:

In the present experiment, on the level of single instructional measures medium effect sizes 
could be accounted for (in the case of support for coherence formation see Brünken et al., 
2005). A sample of 100 participants (25 participants per group) is appropriate for the given 
effect size level. Participants were recruited in from high schools and received compensation 
for their voluntary participation. 

 
74
The computer-based learning and testing material is the same as Experiment 1 and 
data analysis is also conducted by variance analytical methods. Prior knowledge and spatial 
ability serve as control variables measured by appropriate pretests like in Experiment 1. The 
dependent variables are also comparable to that mentioned in the first experiment. 
 
 
3.2.3 Experiment 3: Combined Variation of Two Germane Load Factors 
Research Question and Hypotheses. In a last experiment, the combined effect of two germane 
load enhancing presentation conditions is examined. In a 2*2 factorial design the introduced 
support for coherence formation (with vs. without) of the second experiment is combined with 
another germane load inducing condition, the support for mental animation (with vs. without), 
which has been shown to be effective for learning with complex learning materials including 
process information (see for example Münzer, Seufert & Brünken, 2009). 
Additive effects are expected referring to knowledge acquisition when two supportive 
measures are introduced at the same time. The overall cognitive load should also significantly 
increase in such a combined version:

As in the first experiment, a linear relationship between knowledge acquisition and cognitive 
load is expected, but in a positive way. With a learners higher cognitive load should appear a 
higher level of knowledge acquisition:

Methods and Design. The 2 x 2 factorial design including two germane load factors leads to 
the following four instructional conditions of the learning material:

As already argued for Experiment 2, in the present experiment, on the level of single 
instructional measures medium effect sizes could be accounted for (in the case of support for 
coherence formation see Brünken et al., 2005). A sample of 100 participants (25 participants 
per group) is appropriate, as was the same with the pervious two experiments. Participants 
were recruited from high schools and received compenstation for their voluntary participation. 
The computer-based learning and testing material is the same as used in Experiment 1 and 2. 
Data analysis is also codnucted by variance analytical methods. Prior knowledge and spatial 
ability serve as control variables and are measured by appropriate pretests. The dependent 
variables are also comparable to those mentioned in Experiment 1 and 2. 

 
76
4. Method 
This chapter summarizes the methods of the present work. First, a description of participants 
(see Chapter 4.1), the experimental design (see Chapter 4.2), and the instructional design (see 
Chapter 4.3) is given. Second, the operationalization of independent variables including 
modality, seductive details, support for coherence formation, and mental animation tasks are 
illustrated in detail (see Chapter 4.4), and the according four preliminary single effect studies 
are reported (see Chapter 4.5). Third, the procedure (see Chapter 4.6) and instruments used 
(see Chapter 4.7) are introduced. 
 
4.1 Participants 
All in all, 299 high school students (71.3 % female, 28.7 % male) with an average age of 
17.05 years (SD = 1.39) participated in the three main studies, which were conducted in 
Saarland high schools. Participants were recruited by interested schools and teachers, 
preparing and organizing the setting for the sessions. Students participated voluntarily and 
received 10 Euro. For a motivation effect, they were told they would get 8-10 Euro, 
depending on their performance, recieveing 10 Euro by showing a good performance. Data of 
the participants were collected by using codings in order to guarantee anonymous data 
acquisition. Particpants were also told that their data would be treated as strictly confidential. 
Participant’s acquisition was organized in the way that high school students of all 
performance levels in the referring subject were asked for participation. Allowing for students 
who had chosen biology as their main or minor subject, as well as students who did not select 
biology for the last years in school took part. This allowed for a wide range of prior 
knowledge within the sample. Domain-specific prior knowledge was tested by a questionnaire 
with five multiple choice and eight open questions about the content. The maximum test score 
was 13 and responses ranged from 0 to 11 (M = 4.20, SD = 2.56). Moreover, participants’ 
spatial ability was measured by a standardized paper-folding and card rotation test (Ekstrom, 
French, Harmann & Dermen, 1976). As no time restriction was given, the individual time-on-
task was registered during the learning phase. Time-on-task ranged over all three experiments 
from 4.87 to 43.30 minutes (M = 13.62, SD = 5.93).   
 
4.2 Experimental Design 
In order to test the additivity hypothesis, three 2x2 factorial experiments each with a between-
subject design were conducted. In each experiment, participants were randomly assigned to 

 
77
one of the four experimental groups. As the sessions were organized in a class for class 
testing, the aimed 25 participants per experimental variation could only be approximately 
realized. For an overview of the variations and number of participants per cell see the 
following tables (Table 9-11).

For each of the above presented load factors, separate studies were previously conducted to 
confirm single load effects of each factor manipulation (see Chapter 4.5). In the next part the 
basic materials for all experimental variations of the learning program are described in more 
detail. 
 
4.3 Instructional Design 
A multimedia presentation was varied by modality, seductive details, support for coherence 
formation and mental animation tasks. The subject of the computer-based learning material 
was the structure and function of a cellular molecule, namely the ATP-Synthase. This 
molecule is responsible for the synthesis of ATP, the energizing cell processes. The learning 
material was composed by 11 screens comprising of text and corresponding static pictures on 
each screen. The learning task was to understand the complex structure and function of the 
molecule. Therefore, learners had to imagine rotations and movements within this complex 
spatial building and had to use the text (see Figure 6, down left) for integration with the 
pictorial information (see Figure 6, top left). These 11 screens were surrounded by diverse 
instruction screens, the pretest of prior knowledge and the posttest. The learning program 
started by a welcome screen with a three-dimensional illustration of the ATP-Synthase and 
the words “Welcome to the learning program ATP-Synthase!”.

(original version in German;

After this first sreen, three screens follow to generate the personal code per participant by the 
following indicators: (1) first letter of the first name of the participant’s mother, (2) first letter 
of the first name of the participant’s father, (3) first letter of the participant’s place of birth, 
(4) the participant’s birthday, (5) the month of birth of the participant’s mother. These coding 
gerneration screens were followed by the instructions for the pretest of prior knowledge. The 
pretest included 9 screens with 13 multiple choice and open question items. Then, the 
introduction to the learning program and the conditions of learning was given, the screens 
were presented one after another without the ability to look back at the previous screen. There 
was no time restriction, allowing the participants to decide when to move forward to the next 
screen. A button to access the following screen appeared on each screen, but only after a 
certain time, which was determined by the minimal reading or listening time. Thus, 
participants were prompted to take the time they needed for each screen and to open the next 
screen only when they felt they had completely learned and understood the present screen. 
They also were instructed that a posttest would follow after the learning phase in order to 
examine how much they remember and how they understood the learning material. In some of 
the variations, one more example screen was introduced to instruct participants how to use the 
given additional support such as the support for coherence formation with feedback 
(Experiment 2 and 3) or mental animation tasks (Experiment 3). An example of this screen is 
illustrated in Figure 7.

Support Tools (original

A final announcing screen appeared after the example of how to use the support tool 
including the advice that the experimenter is available in any case of problems. Again, no 
time restriction was given, the time on task was automatically registered by the computer.   
 
4.4 Operationalization of Independent Variables 
In the following part the operationalization of each of the four introduced load factors, the two 
extraneous load factors modality and seductive details as well as the two germane load factors 
support for coherence formation and mental animation, are described in detail.  
 
4.4.1 Modality 
According to the research design of Experiment 1 and 2, the texts of the multimedia screens 
are presented either visually or auditorily. In the visual version the learning text is printed 
below and very near by the picture (see Figure 6), while in the auditory version the 
presentation of this learning text was presented by a professional male speaker. The narration 
immediately begins with the opening of the screen and is only spoken once, participants were 
only given the ability to regulate the volume. After that screen, participants have the ability to 
control the narration of this professional speaker on their own by adjusting the volume and by 
stopping or replaying the narration using an audio controller (see Figure 8). Participants were 
briefed on how to use this audio controller at the beginning of the learning program, 
immediately after the basic instruction to the learning program. 

 
81
 
Fig. 8. Example Screen for 
Auditory Condition (original 
version in German;

In this auditory version, participants were able to concentrate on the spoken text via 
headphones and to simultaneously look at the presented static picture. As there is no time 
restriction given, participants were allowed to reread the text (visual-only condition) or replay 
the narration (auditory condition) as often as they like. The learning program automatically 
registered replay frequency. 
 
4.4.2 Seductive Details 
The variation of seductive details for the research design in Experiment 1 is operationalized as 
follows. On four of the 11 learning screens, a combination of pictures and a text appears on 
the right side of the screen in addition to the learning material on the left side. Thus, learners 
of the seductive details condition have to work around the additional concrete and interesting 
information in form of a text and animated pictures. This additional information included 9 
propositions distributed over the four learning screens. For an overview of all four screens 
including seductive details, see the following four figures (Figure 9-12).

On screen 2/11 the seductive details describe that ATP (the cellular molecule) is the basis for 
all life processes and that ATP is used by each muscle movement. Some examples of typical 
situations are then given and illustrated by four animated pictures (running, sawing, typing 
and playing ball). On screen 3/11 seductive details show that ATP is not only needed in very 
active situations, but also during sleep and winter sleep. On screen 4/11, it is summarized how 
and where ATP is formed is similar for human and animals, but in some cases used for 

 
84
different metabolisms. Some examples of interesting metabolisms are given: the blinking 
firefly to attract a partner, glowing deep sea fishes or jellyfishes using their “lamps”. 
Moreover, additional information is given that these reactions do not produce any warmth and 
that light efficiency is 100 percent. On Screen 9/11 seductive details introduce the case of no 
ATP formation and the consequences, which are no metabolism and no muscule movements, 
being the reason for rigor mortis. This additional information is similar to information often 
included in sidebars of learning books to motivate students. This information is interesting, 
concrete and easy to remember, but irrelevant and not necessary to understand the relevant 
learning content, namely the structure and function of the cellular molecule ATP-Synthase. 
The additional information was rated to be significantly more interesting than the rest of the 
learning material [t(11) = -12.50, p < .001] in a pilot study. However, this additional 
information was not relevant to achieve the learning objectives of the lesson. A manipulation 
check is introduced at the end of the posttest by testing retention of seductive details 
information (e.g., “What is the whole amount of light efficiency of the lighting organ of a 
deep sea fish?” - multiple choice). 
 
4.4.3 Support for Coherence Formation  
The introduced support for coherence formation in Experiment 2 and 3 is operationalized by 
adding to each of the 11 screens a mapping or multiple choice task. Participants are forced to 
solve these tasks by not being able to click to the next screen before entering their answer. 
After that, they get feedback to their solutions of the mapping and multiple choice tasks in the 
way that the right answers in comparison to their own solution are shown on a new screen. 
Learning material was still visible when being forced to answer the support for coherence 
formation tasks. Allowing participants to search for the right answer or realize the right 
mapping of picture elements to the given terms. Figure 13 and 14 provide an example of a 
mapping task and a multiple choice learning question as well as a feedback screen.

This support for coherence formation is realized in the form of training with learning 
questions and mapping tasks that have to be answered during the learning phase. All of these 
mapping tasks and learning questions were added to the posttest as a manipultation check.

4.4.4 Mental Animation 
The variation of mental animation for the research design in Experiment 3 is operationalized 
by adding to eight of the 11 screens a mapping or a multiple choice task, which is related to 
information of the learning material that can be mentally animated. Participants are forced to 
solve these tasks by not being able to click to the next screen before entering their answer.

Task Format for the Mental

After that, they are given feedback to their solutions of mapping and multiple choice tasks in 
the way that the right answers in comparison to their own solution are shown on a new screen. 
Learning material was not visible when being forced to answer the mental animation tasks. 

 
88
Thus, participants had to mentally rotate elements of the learning material or to imagine 
movements of some elements. Figure 15 and 16 provide an example of the mapping task 
format and an example of the multiple choice format for the mental animation condition as 
well as a feedback screen.

The mapping task in Figure 15 demonstrates that learners had to think about movements to 
answer this mental animation task correctly. They were prompted to try and understand not 
only structure but also process information. The multiple choice task in Figure 16 represents a 
typical prediction task, whereby learners have to think about upcoming steps within a process 
and to reflect on the causal chain of the issue at hand (Hegarty et al., 2003). Thus, mental 

 
89
animation is also activated by such predicting activities. For a manipulation check, the 
following two questions were introduced after the posttest: “Did the following pictures 
support you to better understand the processes?” (pictures of Figure 15) and “Did the 
following prompt support you to change your perspective from one to another perspective?” 
The prompt is illustrated in Figure 17 and was used in the mental animation task, where 
learners were informed that the perspective just changed. They were asked in this mapping 
task to search for the correct number in the picture on the right, which is associated with the 
area A of the picture on the left.

Both manipulation check questions were presented in multiple choice format with the options 
“No, not at all”, “No, not really”, “Yes, a little” and “Yes, very much”. 
 
4.5 Four Preliminary Single Effect Studies 
For each of the four introduced load factors modality, seductive details, support for coherence 
formation, and mental animation a preliminary study was conducted to provide evedience for 
these effects. It was necessary to prove single stable effects for each factor, before being able 
to show cumulative effects in the planned three experiments of the present work (see Chapter 
3), as predicted by the additivity hypothesis. Thus, four preliminary single effect studies were 
arranged testing the effect of modality (see Section 4.4.1), the introduced seductive details 
(see Section 4.4.2), the operationalized support for coherence formation (see Section 4.4.3), 
and the induced mental animation (see Section 4.4.4). Preliminary studies are summarized in 
the following section. 
The first preliminary study to show a stable modality effect was realized in the frame 
of an aptitude-treatment-interaction study about memory characteristics and modality in 
multimedia learning (see Seufert et al., 2009). In this study 78 university students of the 

 
90
Education and Psychology Department took part. Their mean age was 23.7 years (SD = 4.44) 
and 74.4 % of them were females. They were randomly assigned to one of the two 
experimental conditions (auditory vs. visual-only). The same learning material as introduced 
in the present work was used in a system-paced version. Learning performance was tested by 
retention, comprehension and transfer tasks in open response as well as multiple choice 
formats. In addition, prior knowledge and spatial ability served as control variables. For both, 
no differences between the experimental groups were found (prior knowledge: F < 1; spatial 
ability: F(1, 77) = 1.97, n.s.). The effect of modality was proven to be stable by an analysis of 
variance (F(1, 77) = 17.12, p < .05, etap² = .18). 
The second preliminary study was conducted to show a stable seductive details effect 
with the same learning material used in the visual-only condition of the preliminary modality 
study. From this study, the material was adapted to a self-paced design with regard to 
necessity the construction of appropriate learning material, which offers learners to use 
learning-enhancing tools like the support for coherence formation or mental animation tasks 
in an intensive way without time restriction. The recruitment of participants for this study was 
restricted to high school students, as the curriculum prescribes the issue ATP-Synthase. Thus, 
the learning program is relevant for these learners and their motivation to learn something 
about the structure and function of this cellular molecule should be higher than the motivation 
of university students. In the preliminary study to test the effect of the introduced seductive 
details, 30 high school students took part with a mean age of 16.76 years (SD = 1.08) and 80.4 
% of them were females. They were randomly assigned to the two experimental conditions 
(control vs. seductive details). Learning performance was tested by retention, comprehension 
and transfer tasks in open response as well as multiple choice formats. Prior knowledge, 
spatial ability and time-on-task served as control variables. For prior knowledge and spatial 
ability, no differences between the experimental groups were found (Fs < 1). However, 
learners of the seductive details condition learned significantly longer (M = 13.87 minutes, 
SD = 3.13 minutes) than learners of the control condition (M = 8.56 minutes, SD = 2.33 
minutes; F(1, 29) = 5.27, p < .05). The effect of seductive details was nevertheless proven to 
be stable by an analysis of covariance (F(1, 29) = 2.92, p = .05, etap² = .10). Learners of the 
control group reached a significantly higher overall learning performance in contrast to 
learners of the seductive details condition. 
The third preliminary study on the stable support for coherence formation effect was 
conducted with the above described learning material (see Section 4.4.3) in a self-paced 
multimedia instruction. In this study 23 high school students particpated with a mean age of 

 
91
17.65 years (SD = 1.11) and 65.2 % of them were females. They were randomly assigned to 
one of the two experimental conditions (with vs. without support for coherence formation). 
Learning performance was tested by retention, comprehension and transfer tasks in open 
response questions as well as multiple choice formats. Prior knowledge, spatial ability and 
time-on-task served as control variables. For spatial ability, no significant difference between 
the experimental groups was found (F < 1), but for prior knowledge and time-on-task group 
differences were found (prior knowledge: F(1, 22) = 7.27, p < .05; time-on-task: F(1, 22) = 
12.53, p < .05). Learners under the support for coherence formation condition showed a 
higher amount of prior knowledge and took more time to learn. Thus, prior knowledge and 
time-on-task were introduced as covariates in the analysis of covariance to test the effect of 
the support for coherence formation. The effect was proven to be stable in the overall learning 
performance (F(1, 22) = 3.20, p < .05, etap² = .14), and in the retention (F(1, 22) = 3.89, p < 
.05, etap² = .17) and transfer subscales (F(1, 22) = 5.91, p < .05, etap² = .24). 
The last preliminary study was conducted to show a stable mental animation effect of 
the above described mental animation tasks (see Section 4.4.4). In this study 30 high school 
students particpated with a mean age of 16.07 years (SD = 1.29) and 50.0 % of them were 
females. They were randomly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions (with vs. 
without mental animation tasks). Learning performance was tested by retention, 
comprehension and transfer tasks in open response questions as well as multiple choice 
formats. Prior knowledge, spatial ability and time-on-task served as control variables. For 
spatial ability and prior knowledge, no significant differences between the experimental 
groups were found (spatial ability: F < 1; prior knowledge: F(1, 29) = 1.10, n.s.), but for time-
on-task (F(1, 29) = 44.39, p < .05). Learners under the mental animation condition took more 
time to learn in contrast to the learners of the control condition. Thus, time-on-task was 
introduced as covariate in the analysis of covariance to test the effect of the mental animation 
tasks. The effect was proven to be stable in transfer performance (F(1, 29) = 4.07, p = .05, 
etap² = .13). 
In all four preliminary studies, the subjectively rated cognitive load scale (Paas, 1994) 
served as a dependent variable, along with the learning performance. However, in the first 
three of the four preliminary studies no cognitive load effect could be found (modality study: 
F(1, 77) = 2.56, n.s.; seductive details study and support for coherence formation study: Fs < 
1). Only learners of the mental animation condition in the last preliminary study rated their 
cognitive load to be significantly higher during learning in contrast to the learners of the 
control condition (F(1, 29) = 3.41, p < .05, etap² = .11). 

 
92
In sum, every experiment has stable single effects at least with regard to the learning 
performance. These single effects confirm the chosen factors to be appropriate for 
combinations in the three planned experiments to empirically test the additivity hypothesis of 
Cognitive Load Theory.  
 
4.6 Procedure  
All three experiments are conducted in one session lasting approximately 90 minutes. 
Particpants are organized in groups of high school students (sixth former). Students are tested 
for spatial abilities by a paper-pencil test. Which is followed by  the computer-based session 
starting with the test for prior knowledge and followed by the computer-based learning 
program on ATP-Synthase. The session ends with the cognitive load ratings and the post-test 
for learning outcomes. The steps of procedure are summarized in Table 12 and then described 
at length.

Introductory instruction. The experimenters introduce themselves and thank the participants 
for their participation. They explain the goal of the multimedia learning study, which is to 
identify how learning programs should be designed to allow optimal learning. Then, the 
prepared sheet of coding generation was introduced and filled out. In this context, they were 
told that their data will be treated as strictly confidential and that coding allows the researcher 
to link the collected data to each other. After this, participants asked to fill out a personal 
questionnaire starting with the just generated personal code and were instructed to shut down 

 
93
their cellulars. The procedure of the session is then described by announcing the two short 
spatial ability tests and the computer-based learning program, which introduces all the steps 
by itself starting with a prior knowledge test, followed by the learning phase and ending with 
questions about the learning content. Paticipants are then informed that the whole procedure 
will take approximately 75 minutes and are requested to work as hard as possible in order to 
understand the given learning material. In addition, they are told they will recieve 8-10 Euro 
depending on their performance. 
Preliminary diagnostic of prerequisites. The first introduced prerequisite spatial ability is 
tested by two standardized subtests of the manual for kit of factor-referenced cognitive tests 
(Ekstrom et al., 1976), the paper-folding and the card rotation test (see Appendix D). Time 
restriction for each of these paper-pencil tests is 3 minutes, which is controlled by the 
experimenter. For a more detailed description of both subtests see Section 4.7.1. The second 
prerequisite prior knowledge is tested later (see computer-based learning phase). 
Instruction to the computer-based learning phase. Participants were instructed to first 
generate their code again in the learning program. They were told that they will learn 
something about biology and but first they will be asked some questions about the biological 
issue in order to check what they already know. The experimenter instructs them not to worry 
about these questions and that it is not problematic if one does not remember anything of this 
issue. They are prompted not just to make a guess on these questions because the goal of this 
part is to be able to differentiate afterwards between what they already knew and what they 
really learned by the program. Participants are then informed that there is no time restriction 
and that the learning program will instruct them now step by step. The instruction ends by 
telling them that if any problems arise the experimenter will be in the room and that when 
they have finished, they should remain quiet in order to give the other learners a chance to 
finish. At this point of instruction the necessary instruction for some variations of the learning 
program is given. This is the case for the introduction of the above described support for 
coherence formation tasks and the mental animation tasks. Participants are instructed that they 
learn a new strategy, which is confirmed to be very helpful during learning and are prompted 
to use these tools. These specific instructions are written down for each variation (see 
Appendix A-C) and guarantee a standardized verbal instruction.   
Computer-based learning phase. The computer-based learning phase starts with the pretest of 
prior knowledge, which is described in more detail in Section 4.7.1. After that a learning 

 
94
instruction is given and the 11 learning screens follow, as already described above in Chapter 
4.3 (for an overview on all 11 screens, see Appendix E). Between screen 4 and 5 a process 
diagnostic of mental effort is introduced, asking for the participant’s mental effort by working 
on the learning material and prompting to evaluate how easy or difficult it was to understand 
the learning material. This diagnostic is repeated at the end of the learning phase, after screen 
11 and followed immediately by the posttest. 
Final diagnostic. The computer-based posttest includes 23 items for all variations and is 
extended with a manipulation ckeck of 10 items in Experiment 1, 11 items in Experiment 2 
and 2 items in Experiment 3. Two more questions about mental effort and task difficulty are 
introduced after the posttest referring to the posttest situation. After that participants have to 
evaluate intrinsic, extraneous and germane load during learning by means of seven questions 
(see Section 4.7.2). 
Receipt of 10 Euro after performance check. Participants receive 10 Euro after the verification 
that most of the open response formatted learning questions were answered. If this is not the 
case, the experimenter hands the participant 10 Euro by saying that they were close enough.  
Experimenter. All three experiments were conducted by the author and two university 
students of the educational and the psychological program of the Saarland University. 
Preliminary to the experiments, students were accurately briefed on how to conduct the 
experiments and during the investigation supervised by the author. Moreover, a written 
instruction allowed all experimenters to conduct the experiment as standardized as possible. 
 
4.7 Instruments 
The measurement of the learning prerequisite prior knowledge and the dependent variable 
learning success is collected by knowledge tests, already used in previous studies using the 
same learning material (Koch, Seufert & Brünken, 2008; Seufert et al., 2009). The second 
learning prerequisite spatial ability is measured by two standardized subtests of a test battery 
from Ekstrom et al. (1976). The second dependent variable cognitive load is operationalized 
by a scale of 9 items including the mental effort items developed by Paas (1992). All 
instruments are precisely described in the following parts. In Section 4.7.1 the measurement 
of the learning prerequisites prior knowledge and spatial ability are illustrated. Section 4.7.2 
then summarizes the measurement of the two dependent variables learning success and 
cognitive load. 

 
95
4.7.1 Measurement of Learning Prerequisites 
The measurement of spatial ability is suggested to be one of the most influencing 
prerequisites to learn with multimedia presentations, prior knowledge is another important 
learning prerequisite that has to be measured in every learning study. The following section 
introduces the spatial ability and prior knowledge test used in all three experiments.  
Spatial Ability. The prerequisite spatial ability is tested by two subtests paper-folding and 
card-rotation adapted from the standardized tests summarized in the manual for kit of factor-
referenced cognitive tests (Ekstrom et al., 1976). The experimenter introduces these tests to 
the participants by describing the goal of measuring how well they can imagine something in 
its spatial form. First, the test of card-rotation is introduced by reading the written instruction 
aloud, which includes an example task. Participants are prompted to check every given 
rotated card out of eight cards per line on its fittings with the original card given at the 
beginning of the line. Participants have to imagine the rotation of the original card to check 
the similarity to the card in question. After the solution of the example task is given, 
participants have time to correct their answer and/or to ask questions. Then, the experimenter 
signals to turn the page in order to begin the card-rotation test determined by the overall 80 
card-rotation items within the given 3 minutes. The experimenter signals the end of the 
restricted time and introduces the paper-folding test. This test is also given by reading the 
written instruction aloud and solving an example task. Here, five solution papers are given per 
line and the only correct one should be discovered that fits with the folded and hole-punched 
paper presented at the beginning of the line. Participants have to imagine the folding action 
and the consequences for the initially punched holes. After the solution of an example task is 
given, participants have time to correct their answer and/or to ask questions. Then, the 
experimenter signals to turn the page in order to begin the paper-folding test limited by 
overall 10 paper-folding items within the given 3 minutes. The experimenter signals when the 
restricted time is over. The spatial ability value a participant reaches is determined by the 
average of both test values, the mean of the percentage of correct answers in the card-rotation 
test and the percentage of correct answers in the paper-folding test. 
Prior knowledge. For the diagnose of the domain-specific prior knowledge, a computer-based 
pretest with five multiple choice and eight open-response formatted questions about the 
content domain is introduced in all experiments at the beginning of the learning program. The 
construction of this pretest considers different levels of prior knowledge including questions 

 
96
about structural and procedural knowledge. Table 13 shows all items of the prior knowledge 
test. Every question can be answered by using the option “I don’t know” instead of 
formulating an answer to the open-ended questions or choosing the already formulated 
multiple choice answers.

In order to answer each of these questions, a basic knowledge of the issue ATP-Synthase is 
necessary. The theoretical maximum is one point per item and for the complete test 13 points. 
Some of the items are associated with factual knowledge, while others are demanding a 
higher level of knowledge, which is labeled comprehension. The first three questions only ask 
for definitions, which could be remembered without the necessity to understand them. 
Questions 11 and 12 also ask for pure factual knowledge, because these items are about the 
structure of the molecule. All other items require a higher level of knowledge to be able to 
answer correctly. This is indicated by the word comprehension in Table 13, as the issue has to 
be understood in more detail to know the right answer. An analysis sheet for all items 
including examples of correct answers to questions with open response format is used to get a 
high interrater reliability. The intercorrelations of the 13 test items are illustrated in Table 14 
from Experiment 1 to get an impression of these pretest items used in all experiments.    
Table 14. Intercorrelations of Prior Knowledge Test Items 
Note. * p < .05, ** p < .01, two-tailed significance testing.   
Prior knowledge test items correlate with each other on very different levels, illustrated by the 
varying correlation coefficients in Table 14. Accordingly, the reliability of the prior 
knowledge test presents a cronbachs alpha of .70. As it was the goal to construct a 
heterogeneous test, which measures different knowledge aspects and levels not necessarily 
referring to each other, the reliability of this test is not as high as it could be estimated its

internal validity. It should be mentioned that this test of reliability underestimates the quality 
of the present prior knowledge test, because the internal consistency is only representing the 
homogeneity of a test and thereafter underestimates heterogeneous test constructions (Bortz & 
Döring, 1995). In addition, the reliability of the prior knowledge test: In Experiment 2 and 3 
cronbachs alpha reached a value of .62 and .74, respectively and all data together of all three 
experiments result in a cronbachs alpha of .74. 
 
4.7.2 Measurement of Dependent Variables 
Learning Success. For all three experiments different learning scales turned out to be 
appropriate. Every experiment has its two previous studies (see Chapter 4.5) confirming 
stable single effects of the two effects that are thereafter appropriate to combine in a following 
study. For measuring the combination of two stable effects of the two previous studies, it is 
necessary to guarantee two effects in one and the same scale or subscale for both previous 
studies to get the option of measuring a combination effect in this scale. As no overall 
learning scale turned out to be useful from previous studies (modality study, seductive details 
study, coherence formation study and mental animation study) and for all three experiments 
(Experiment 1, 2 and 3), the following method to get at least one scale for each experiment 
and its previous studies was used. By running a factor analysis for each experiment, the main 
factors of each experiment were figured out. These factors were tested on their utility for the 
single effects needed in the two previous studies. For each experiment a different learning 
success scale turned out to be useful, which are presented in more detail in the following part. 
Learning Success of Experiment 1. The exploratory factor analysis of Experiment 1 with an 
overall KMO-Index of .73 results in five factors, by using the principle component method, 
explaining all together 67.79 % of variance. Only three of these factors are interpretable and 
explain all together 48.33 % of the variance. The factors were interpreted as a problem-
solving and comprehension scale, a transfer scale and a retention scale. As not all of these 
items were included in the first previous study testing the modality effect, some of the items 
of these factors had to be excluded. From the overall 18 post test items, which were included 
in both previous studies and in Experiment 1, one item had to be excluded because of a very 
low MSA-Indix (MSA = Measure of Sampling Adequacy; less then .50). Four other items 
were excluded because of a low value in the rotated component matrix (less then .50). All 
remaining 13 items were associated with 5 factors. However, only three of these factors were 
interpretable. The most interesting factor included 5 items explaining the learning success in 

 
99
both previous studies and in Experiment 1. These items were one item of the comprehension 
and problem solving factor (What happens with the subelements Alpha and Beta during the 
rotation of the axis? – open response format), two items of the transfer factor (Which cells do 
feature the highest number of mitochondrions? – multiple choice response format; Please give 
reasons for your response! – open response format) and two items of the retention factor 
(Which task does the F0-Complex of the ATP-Synthase perform? – open response format; a 
mapping task asking for the composition of the ATP- Synthase, wich is a molecule – 
participants respond to this question by selecting the right illustration elements of a mix of 
pictures and putting them into the right open spaces in the presented illustration). The 
probability to solve these items lies between 20 % and 80 % (see Table 15).

Note. ORF = Open Response Format; MC = Multiple Choice, MT = Mapping Task; MSA-
Indices = Measure of Sampling Adequacy-Index, which should be higher than .50.  
These items are selected to build the learning success scale becase of confirming single 
effects in both previous studies (seducitve details effect: F(1, 29) = 2.92, p = .05, etap² = .10; 
modality effect: F(1, 77) = 17.12, p < .05, etap²  = .18; see also Seufert et al., 2009, showing 
the modality effect in other subscales), being associated with the main factor that turned out in 
the factor analysis of Experiment 1 and thereafter being appropriate to test the combination of 
the two extraneous load factors modality and seductive details.

Learning Success of Experiment 2. The exploratory factor analysis of Experiment 2 with an 
overall middling KMO-Index of .67 results in eight factors, by using the principle component 
method, explaining all in all 63.34 % of variance. But not all of these factors were 
interpretable and none of them, neither the combined scale of all these factors turned out to be 
useful, not confirming the needed single stable effects of both previous studies (modality and 
support for coherence formation effect). This could be due to the fact that these two effects 
are logically not measureable and may be the same factor, because of representing different 
load types (modality = extraneous load vs. support for coherence formation = germane load). 
Thus, for this experiment it was necessary to take the subscales retention, comprehension and 
transfer, which were theoretically deduced already within the post test construction. In the 
transfer scale including four items, the single stable effects could be confirmed in the previous 
modality study (cronbachs alpha = .56; F(1, 77) = 2.94, p < .05, etap² = .04) and the previous 
support for coherence formation study (cronbachs alpha = .69; F(1, 22) = 2.94, p = .05, etap² 
= .13). The probability to solve these items lies between 20 and 80 % (see Table 16).

This subscale has a cronbachs alpha of .59 derived from the data of Experiment 2. Cronbachs 
Alpha varies over the two previous studies and Experiment 2. Since it is a variation between 
.56 and .73, this subscale is seen as appropriate to measure the learning success with respect

to its reliability. The presented items of Table 16 are selected to build the learning success 
scale confirming single effects in both previous studies (modality study and support for 
coherence formation study), being associated with transfer learning activity, which is the 
highest required level of knowledge. By showing that it is possible to measure different load 
types in one and the same learning subscale, this transfer subscale is appropriate to test the 
combination of one extraneous load factor, modality, with one germane load factor, support 
for coherence formation. 
Learning Success of Experiment 3. The exploratory factor analysis of Experiment 3 resulted 
in an overall middling KMO-Index of .74 with seven factors, by using the principle 
component method, explaining a total of 60.68 % of variance. Not all of these factors were 
interpretable and none of them, neither the combined scale of all these factors turned out to be 
useful, not confirming the needed single stable effects of both previous studies (support for 
coherence formation effect and mental animation effect). This time it could not even be due to 
the fact that these two effects are logically not measureable in one and the same factor as 
already argued for Experiment 2, because of representing the same load types (support for 
coherence formation effect as well as mental animation effect = germane load effect). 
However, for Experiment 3 it was necessary to take the subscales retention, comprehension 
and transfer, which were theoretically deduced already within the post test construction. In the 
transfer scale including four items, the single stable effects could be confirmed in the previous 
support for coherence formation study (cronbachs alpha = .69; F(1, 22) = 2.94, p = .05, etap² 
= .13) and the previous mental animation study (cronbachs alpha = .55; F(1, 29) = 4.07, p = 
.05, etap² = .13). The probability to solve these items lies between 20 % and 80 % (see Table 
17). This subscale has a cronbachs alpha of .65 derived from the data of Experiment 3. 
Cronbachs Alpha varies over the two previous studies and Experiment 3. Since it is a 
variation between .55 and .69, this subscale could be seen as appropriate to measure the 
learning success with respect to its reliability.

Table 17. Probability to Solve Posttest Items - Data of Experiment 3 
Note. ORF = Open Response Format; MC = Multiple Choice. 
The presented items of Table 17 are selected to build the learning success scale confirming 
single effects in both previous studies (support for coherence formation and mental animation 
study), being associated with transfer learning activity, which reflects deep processing. 
Cognitive Load. For all three experiments, the same scales turned out to be useful to measure 
cognitive load. By a factor analysis of the data sets of each main experiment, the two items 
asking for mental effort during learning and immediately after learning were confirmed as one 
factor in each of the three studies. This mental effort factor could be expected as these two 
items are similar in their content and the presentation format of rating on a seven-point Likert 
scale. A second factor also turned out to be stable over the three data sets, comprising some 
items of the new introduced scale to differentially measure the three cognitive load types. 
These items all ask for the level of difficulty to be rated on a seven-point Likert scale. In 
detail, it was asked for the difficulty of the issue (item 1: How easy or difficult did you find 
the issue “Functioning and structure of the ATP-Synthase”?), the difficulty of understanding 
the overall connection of the learning material (item 2: How easy or difficult did you find it to 
understand the overall connection of the learning material?) and the difficulty of imaging the

entire process of the learning content (item 3: How easy or difficult did you find it to imagine 
the entire process of the ATP-Synthese with its conformation changes?). These items were 
generated to differentiate between intrinsic load (item 1: referring to the learning issue or 
material) and germane load (item 2 and 3: referring to understanding or imagination 
processes), but turned out to be one factor, which could be due to the fact that they all began 
with the same words “How easy or difficult did you find it to…” and moreover seven of these 
items were presented on only two screens. Thus, the answers are perhaps biased by one and 
the same response direction, a participant decided on the first items of these seven. The items 
ask all in all rather for the overall difficulty of the context. Therefore, this factor is named 
context difficulty in the following parts. 
Interrater reliability. Interrater Reliability was guaranteed by using an explicit categorization 
sheet for the items with open response format. Examples of item solutions were given on this 
sheet for every item. The answers were coded independently by two raters with a good 
interrater agreement for these items. The Kappa Coefficient for all four previous studies and 
the three experiments lies between .73 and .88. In cases of disagreement, the final score was 
determined by discussion. Kappa Coefficients for all studies are listed below (see Table 18).

5. Results and Conclusions 
This chapter shows all results and conclusions of the three experiments in detail by reporting 
the means and standard deviations of all variables over the four conditions and showing all 
main and interaction effects of the dependent variables, resulting in a short conclusion per 
study (see Chapter 5.1 - 5.3). In the last part, the main results and conclusions are summarized 
to get an overview of all three studies and a final answer to the research question, if the 
combinations of two instructional measures, associated with extraneous and/or germane 
cognitive load, induce cumulative effects regarding knowledge acquisition and cognitive load 
as predicted by Cognitive Load Theory (see Chapter 5.4). For all presented studies, the 
significance level of α = .05 was chosen. 
 
5.1 Results and Conclusion of Experiment 1: Combining Two Extraneous Load Factors 
To briefly summarize the hypothesis of Experiment 1: The Additivity Hypothesis predicts a 
linear relationship between cognitive load and learning success. The expected pattern in 
learning success is illustrated in the following figure (see Figure 18).

As the values in Table 19 (see below) show, there are no between-group differences in the 
three control variables, spatial ability (F(3, 74) = 1.16, n.s), prior knowledge (F(3, 99) = 2.27, 
n.s.) and time-on-task (F(3, 99) = 2.13, n.s). Thus, an analysis of variance could be conducted 
without covariates.

The only observable similarity between the expected pattern and the results of the present 
experiment can be seen in the learning success, comparing the visual-only group with the 
audiovisual group (see Figure 20). Learners show a higher learning success under the 
audiovisual learning condition. The modality effect is therefore replicated (F(1, 99) = 6.51, p 
< .05, etap² = .06). In contrast, the seductive details effect could not be replicated, as this time 
the found effect was in the opposite direction. Learners profited from seductive details (F(1, 
99) = 4.03, p = .05, etap² = .04) in contrast to the previous study (see Chapter 4.5), where 
learners were impeded by the irrelevant additional information. These first results are the 
result of an interaction effect (F(1, 99) = 6.27, p < .05, etap² = .06). Learners reached the 
highest learning success under the audiovisual condition including seductive details, while 
learners of all other conditions only reached a comparable medium level of learning success 
(audiovisual with seductive details vs. audiovisual without seductive details: mean difference 
= 1.46, p < .01; audiovisual with seductive details vs. visual-only with seductive details: mean 
difference = 1.64, p < .01; audiovisual with seductive details vs. visual-only without seductive 
details: mean difference = 1.48, p < .01) (see Figure 20).  

 
107
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 20. Results of Learning Success – Experiment 1 
The cognitive load measure showed that learners rated their mental effort higher under the 
audiovisual instruction (F(1, 99) = 6.90, p < .05, etap² = .07) indicating that the higher 
learning efficiency of the audiovisual version was accompanied by a higher amount of self-
reported effort (see Figure 21).

Furthermore, participants rated context difficulty nearly at the same level (see Figure 22). No 
main and no interaction effects (Fs < 1) can be reported. This indicates that the different 
conditions are constructed with a comparable level of difficulty. The modality as well as the 
seductive details did not influence the level of estimated learning material difficulty.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 22. Results of Context Difficulty – Experiment 1 
In addition, the majority of learners in the audiovisual conditions used the replay function (62 
% replayed more than once, on average; only 8 % never used the replay function). Thus, the 
self-pacing of the text and the narration were comparable in the sense that students reread or 
replayed the explanations. 
Moreover, the manipulation check conducted by the retention test about the content of 
seductive details shows high retention performance of the participants who learned under the 
seductive details condition (M = 64.67 %, SD = 21.07 %). This manipulation check included 
eight items and two items were excluded because the probability to solve them did not lie 
between 20 % and 80 %. 
Another interesting detail is that 52 % of the participants under the audiovisual 
condition with seductive details referred to the learning content that was most interesting to 
them when answering the question. Only 24 % referred to seductive details. This is a hint that 
seductive details worked as motivating or arousing elements, getting the learner more 
interested in the relevant, but not as interesting learning material. However, this hint was only 
found for the audiovisual condition. In contrast, the majority of participants under the visual-
only condition with seductive details (44 %) referred with respect to this question to seductive

details, while 32 % of this learning group referred to the learning content. Nearly the same 
pattern was found for the estimation of these learners, when asking them which information 
they will remember for the longest time. The majority of participants (48 %) under the 
audiovisual condition with seductive details referred to the learning content, while only 16 % 
referred to seductive details. However, participants under the visual-only condition with 
seductive details did not show any difference in their reference, 32 % referring to the leraning 
content and 32 % referring to seductive details. These patterns support the pattern found for 
learning success and show not only highest performance under the audiovisual condition with 
seductive details, but also a higher interest in the learning content after their learning session. 
In sum, the results of Experiment 1 suggest that combined effects of extraneous load 
factors are not necessarily additive. The negative effect of one extraneous load factor 
(seductive details) was reversed when adding a second extraneous load factor (modality). 
While seductive details impeded learning under a high load design condition, they fostered 
learning under a low load condition. This could be interpreted as a motivational effect of 
seductive details, which is only possible to occur under low loading multimedia instruction. 
The audiovisual version of the learning material evoked higher learning success by allowing 
the learner to use the overall processing capacity in a more efficient way. It is possible that 
under this condition, learners were able to use seductive details in a constructive way, e.g. by 
using them as anchor items during the posttest or by constructing an associative knowledge 
network based on the presented details. Another explanation could be that seductive details 
worked as motivating or arousing elements, getting the learner more interested in the relevant, 
but not as interesting learning material. This interpretation is supported by the higher self-
reported effort of the audiovisual groups and illustrates the necessity to investigate further in 
the underlying affective aspects during learning, as the Cognitive-Affective Theory of 
Learning with Media (CATLM; Moreno, 2006) suggests.

5.2 Results and Conclusion of Experiment 2: Combining One Extraneous Load Factor 
With One Germane Load Factor 
To briefly summarize the hypothesis of Experiment 2: The Additivity Hypothesis predicts that 
the relationship between learning success and cognitive load depends on the induced type of 
load. The expected pattern is illustrated in the following figures (see Figure 23 and 24).

As the values in Table 21 (see below) show, there were no between-group differences in the 
two control variables spatial ability (F < 1) and prior knowledge (F(3, 99) = 2.00, n.s.). 
Participants varied only significantly in time-on-task (F(3, 99) = 38.75, p < .05), showing 
longer learning times under both conditions with support for coherence formation. This could 
be due to the fact that the learning material is extended under these conditions by the 
additional tasks and the use of feedback.

The logical statistical consequence now is to use an analysis of covariance. The following 
values shown in the tables and figures are not adapted in order to present the given data. Also 
in this experiment, the values of the dependent variables show a different pattern in contrast to 
the expected pattern (compare Table 22 with Figures 23 and 24). On the descriptive level, 
there are no large differences between the learning success values per condition and this 
pattern continues with the construct of mental effort.

The analysis of covariance confirmed that there are no main and no interaction effects in 
learning success (Fs < 1; see Figure 25). These results contrast the results of both previous 
studies, where the modality effect was shown as the first single stable effect and the support 
for coherence formation was proved to be a learning-enhancing tool as the second single 
stable effect (see Chapter 4.5).

In mental effort, no main effects for modality and support for coherence formation were found 
(Fs < 1), but an interaction effect was confirmed (F(1, 99) = 5.83, p < .05, etap² = .06) (see 
Figure 26). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 26. Results of Mental Effort – Experiment 2 
This pattern is almost the expected one, as the participants under the audiovisual condition 
without support for coherence formation rated their mental effort lower than the participants 
under the audiovisual condition with support for coherence formation. This same direction 
should be found for the visual-only condition on a higher rating level, but this is not 
confirmed because of the participants, who learned with support. These participants of the 
visual-only condition with support for coherence formation did not feel like investing as much 
mental effort as it was expected. The interaction effect could be due to the different modalities 
of learning instruction and the presented visual-only format of the support for coherence 
formation. The instructional format fits especially well, when all elements are presented in a 
visual-only format. Since the support for coherence formation tasks are presented within the 
learning material, it is very easy to answer the learning questions and the mapping task by  
referring to the learning material. Thus, learners did not feel as if they invested effort due to  
this support in a visual-only condition and rated the invested effort the highest under the 
audiovisual condition with support. This indicates that participants rated rather a management 
aspect of the learning material than the invested learning-enhancing effort. The pattern also 
underlines that the support for coherence formation was easy to handle, especially under the 
visual-only condition and allowed the learners to not have to invested as much effort. The

support for coherence formation is therefore well designed, as the learning success was 
significantly higher in the previous study by using this support (see Chapter 4.5). In another 
learning success subscale of Experiment 2, comprehension, the support for coherence 
formation could also be confirmed by an analysis of variance without the covariate time-on-
task. This effect indicates that the support is especially useful to animate learners to engage in 
learning longer and to use the invested time-on-task to reach a higher level of comprehension 
(see Figure 27; F(1, 99) = 9.59, p < .05, etap² = .09). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Fig. 27. Results of Comprehension – Experiment 2 
This interpretation is moreover confirmed by the context difficulty data. There are no main 
effects for the support for coherence formation (F(1, 99) = 2.65, n.s.) or for modality (F(1, 99) 
= 1.98, n.s.) as well as no interaction effect (F(1, 99) = 1.26, n.s.), indicating that it was not 
more difficult to work on the audiovisual learning program including a visual-only support for 
coherence formation (see Figure 28). It was not more difficult to understand the overall 
connection of the learning material or to imagine the entire process of the learning content. 
Participants of different conditions also did not differ significantly in their estimation of 
difficulty of the learning issue.

In addition, the majority of learners in the audiovisual conditions used the replay function (52 
% replayed once or more than once, on average; only 2 % never used the replay function). 
Thus, self-pacing of the text and the narration were comparable in the sense that students 
reread or replayed the explanations. 
Likewise the manipulation check conducted by a post test of the support for coherence 
formation tasks showed high performance of the participants who learned under the support 
for coherence formation condition (M = 57.86 %, SD = 17.91 %). This manipulation check 
included all the eleven support for coherence formation items already introduced in the 
learning phase, therefore reflecting a testing to the test performance. However this 
manipulation check shows that learners really invested in the presented support for coherence 
formation tasks, they were forced to answer during learning. 
In sum, the results of Experiment 2 also suggest that combined effects of an 
extraneous load factor with a germane load factor are not necessarily additive. No main or 
interaction effects in learning success could be found and only an interaction effect was found 
in the cognitive load measure. On another subscale of learning success, comprehension, only 
one main effect of support for coherence formation could be confirmed by an analysis of 
variance without the covariate time-on-task, but no modality effect. This leads to the overall 
interpretation that the induced factors of two different load types does not seem to foster 
learning in the way Cognitive Load Theory assumes. At minimum the combination of the 
extraneous load factor modality and the germane load factor support for coherence formation

do not produce a compensatory effect. In addition, the interaction effect in cognitive load 
measure could be explained by a modality-specific effect of the introduced factors. Learners 
under the condition with support for coherence formation rated their mental effort to be very 
low when confronted with visual-only material, but very high when confronted with 
audiovisual material. This could be due to the fact that the visually presented support for 
coherence formation was easier to use with visual-only material because the answers to the 
introduced learning questions could be easily found in the text-picture combination of the 
learning material. In contrast, learners who received the audiovisual learning material had to 
replay the audio file to get the requested information and therefore perhaps felt hindered to 
use the support for coherence formation in an effective way. This interpretation in 
combination with the found comparable learning performance over all conditions does not 
support the often used argumentation of compensation of reduced extraneous load by germane 
load activity and therefore should be used very carefully. However, to confirm such 
conclusions, it will be necessary to combine other extraneous and germane load effects and 
also in other learning domains.

5.3 Results and Conclusion of Experiment 3: Combining Two Germane Load Factors  
To briefly summarize the hypothesis of Experiment 3: The Additivity Hypothesis predicts a 
linear relationship between cognitive load and learning success. The expected pattern is 
illustrated in the following figures (see Figure 29 and 30).

linear trend (md = 7.1, p < .05), which is reflected by longer learning times when more 
germane load is induced (see Table 24; increasing values from left to right). This could be due 
to the fact that the learning material is extended under these conditions by the additional tasks 
and used feedback method.

Thus, the conducted analysis of covariance included the covariates prior knowledge and time-

the given data. 
Also in this experiment, the values of dependent variables show a different pattern in contrast 
to the expected pattern (compare Table 24 with Figures 29 and 30). On the descriptive level, 
there are no big differences between the reached learning success values per condition and 
this seems to be the same in mental effort.

The analysis of covariance confirmed that there are no main or interaction effects in learning 
success (Fs < 1; see Figure 31). These results contrast the results of both previous studies, 
where the support for coherence formation effect could be shown as the first single stable 
effect and the mental animation task has been proved to be a learning-enhancing tool as the 
second single stable effect (see Chapter 4.5).

In mental effort, the analysis of covariance with both covariates prior knowledge and time-on-
task also confirmed the descriptive summary: no main effects for support for coherence 
formation (F(1, 98) = 1.82, n.s.) or mental animation tasks (F(1, 98) = 1.02, n.s.) as well as no 
interaction effect (F < 1). Figure 32 presents a pattern of the given data (not adapted) that is 
nearly the expected one. The participants under the mental animation condition with support 
for coherence formation rated their mental effort the highest, while the participants under the 
control condition without any learning-enhancing tool rated their mental effort the lowest. 
However, the analysis of covariance could not confirm the expected main effects.

Moreover, the four conditions seem not to differ in task difficulty. Learners rated context 
difficulty to be nearly the same under all conditions. An analysis of covariance did not turn 
out a main effect for the support for coherence formation (F(1, 98) = 1.21, n.s.), nor for 
mental animation tasks (F < 1). Beyond that, no interaction effect between these two factors 
was observable (F < 1). Thus, the variable context difficulty indicates that all four conditions 
offered a comparable task difficulty (see Figure 33). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fig. 33. Results of Context Difficulty  – Experiment 3. 
In addition, the majority of learners in the mental animation conditions (92.3 %) rated the 
mental animation tasks to be helpful for understanding the presented processes; only 7.7 % of 
this learning group rated these tasks not to be conducive. The majority of these learners also 
agreed that the mental animation tasks were helpful in changing from one to another 
perspective (69.2 %), only 30.8 % did not agree. Thus, the learning-enhancing mental 
animation tasks were rated to be useful for the majority of particpants. 
In the present experiment, no extensive manipulation check was included, as there was 
not enough time left in the procedure to introduce all items presented during the learning 
phase (all the eleven support for coherence formation items and all eight mental animation 
items) after the post test. However, the performance with respect to the items used during the 
learning phase also shows how effective learners used these treatment tools. Participants, who 
were forced to answer the mental animation tasks showed a good performance in responding 
these tasks (eight mental animation tasks) during the learning process (M = 50.98 %, SD = 
22.59 %). The appropriate use of the support for coherence formation tasks is also shown by

good performance in responding to the according tasks (11 support for coherence formation 
tasks) during the learning process (m = 52.33 %, SD = 19.94 %). 
In sum, results of Experiment 3 suggest that combined effects of germane load factors 
are not necessarily additive. No main or interaction effects in learning success could be found. 
Without an effect on the level of the learning performance, effects on the level of cognitive 
load do not indicate an overall positive cognitive load. However, the expected effect pattern in 
the cognitive load subscale mental effort could be found in a descriptive way. This pattern of 
two main effects of both learning-enhancing tools could nevertheless not be confirmed by the 
analysis of covariance. This leads to the overall interpretation that the induced factors of one 
and the same load type seem not to foster learning in the way Cognitive Load Theory assumes 
it. At least the combination of the support for coherence formation and mental animation tasks 
do not produce a cumulative effect for the learning success. Thus, the cognitive load measure 
seems to reflect only the invested effort without any effect for learning. This could be 
interpreted as an overload by the combination of both germane load factors, but the overall 
reached learning success level of around 50 % does not support this conclusion. To confirm 
such conclusions, it will be necessary to replicate this study with other germane load factors 
and in other learning domains to get further insights into combination effects of learning 
tools. 
 
5.4 Summary of Results and Conclusions  
The above described results indicate that the relation between the load types is not as simple 
as Cognitive Load Theory predicts. The overall cognitive load could not be determined by the 
three load types intrinsic, extraneous and germane load in an additive way. 
Experiment 1, combining two extraneous load factors, shows that the combination can 
reverse the results of single extraneous load effects into another well interpretable pattern. 
While seductive details impeded learning under a high load design condition, they fostered 
learning under a low load condition. Seductive details may have a beneficial learning effect 
only under conditions of low cognitive load. The audiovisual condition of the learning 
environment promoted higher learning success because, compared to the visual-only 
condition, learners had more cognitive resources to use the seductive details in a constructive 
way, such as by constructing an associative knowledge network based on seductive detail 
information. This interpretation is supported by the higher self-reported effort of the 
audiovisual groups. 

 
123
Experiment 2 clarifies that even single stable effects of one extraneous load factor and 
one germane load factor can turn out not to be additive in the way that no effect at all is 
observable when combining them. Especially the compensatory effect of reducing extraneous 
load to have more resources free for germane load activity is not observable by these results. 
In addition, the similar data of learning success over all conditions, the interaction in mental 
effort did show that an induced high extraneous load in combination with an induced high 
germane load does not guarantee the overall highest mental effort. This interaction effect 
indicates a modality-specific effect of the visually presented support for coherence formation 
and could only be interpreted as such in combination with the presented support for coherence 
formation effect for comprehension only found in an analyis of variance without the covariate 
time-on-task. Moreover, this interpretation shows that the subjective ratings of participants 
open a wide range of opportunities for interpretations. Perhaps learners did not rate in this 
case the requested mental effort, but some management aspect and that is why the learners 
under the audiovisual condition with support for coherence formation rated to have invested 
more effort. 
Experiment 3 shows similar results, as no main effects for the two introduced germane 
load factors and no interaction effect of these factors could be shown in the appropriate 
learning success scale (showing effects in both previous studies, support for coherence 
formation and mental animation effect). The cognitive load scale seems to show exactly the 
expected pattern. This pattern could however not be confirmed by an analysis of covariance. 
Also, in the case of having found the expected cognitive load pattern, the upcoming problem 
of interpretation would have been the same: No learning effect was found, not even on other 
subscales. 
With respect to the initial research question if the additivity hypothesis of Cognitive 
Load Theory can be empirically tested, the present findings point to the need to reconsider the 
additivity hypothesis, which does not predict any interaction effect as found in Experiment 1 
in the learning success scale and in Experiment 2 in the mental effort scale. All three 
experiments show other patterns as predicted by Cognitive Load Theory, resulting in 
alternative interpretations of these boundary effects of the present work. However, these 
results overall contradict the basic additivity assumption of Cognitive Load Theory. The 
falsification implications for cognitive load research will be discussed in the next chapter 
resulting in future directions. 
 

 
124
6. Discussion and Future Directions 
The last part of the present work begins with a discussion of the falsification of the additivity 
hypothesis raised by Cognitive Load Theory, which results in implications for further 
cognitive load research (see Chapter 6.1). After that, boundary effects of the present work and 
their implications are discussed (see Chapter 6.2) followed by practical implications (see 
Chapter 6.3). Finally, the present work closes with future directions (see Chapter 6.4). 
 
6.1 Falsification of the Additivity Hypothesis - Implications for Cognitive Load Research 
Before discussing consequences of the falsification of the additivity hypothesis by the present 
work, it is necessary to ask the question can this basic hypothesis of Cognitive Load Theory 
be empirically tested. The methods used in the present work are appropriate to measure the 
differences in total cognitive load and the learning performance. This is done by combining 
two extraneous load factors in the first experiment, one extraneous and one germane load 
factor in the second and two germane load factors in the third experiment, while holding the 
intrinsic load factor constant over all experiments by one and the same given task. However, 
the validity and sensitivity of subjective ratings used to measure cognitive load needs to be 
considered in relation to the question which learning scales we should use to investigate 
cognitive load effects. After that, implications for cognitive load research are summerized for 
each of the three experiments, demonstrating first the falsification of the additivity hypothesis 
per experiment and discussing the arising questions afterwards. All implications of the present 
work for cognitive load research are summarized at the end of this section. 
 
The Validity and Sensitivity of Subjective Ratings Used to Measure Cognitive Load 
With the present research program, the limited validity and sensitivity of subjective ratings 
used to measure cognitive load has become evident. In the procedure of the presented 
experiments, the items of Paas (1992) asking for mental effort was introduced during learning 
as a process item and immediately after the learning phase. This is a widespread and 
frequently used measure of cognitive load. In the four preliminary studies, stable learning 
effects were confirmed for modality, seductive details, support for coherence formation and 
mental animation tasks, subjective cognitive load ratings were only useful to measures the 
mental animation effect. In all other previous studies, no cognitive load effects could be 
confirmed. Learners seem not to be able to differentiate between the different levels of mental 
effort they were asked to rate. In addition, the results of the three resulting experiments 

 
125
demonstrated that the majority of learners rate their mental effort to be on a medium level 
(around 4-5 points on a seven-point Likert scale). To add more information about subjective 
rating behaviour in Experiments 1-3, 71 %, 63 % and 61.6 % of learners respectively rated 
their mental effort to be on a medium level between 55-71 %. This is at least the rating 
behaviour found for high school students (n = 299) and the introduced learning material. 
Thus, all interpretations with respect to cognitive load measured by these items should be 
considered very carefully. Moreover, the introduced and recently operationalized 
differentiating measure of cognitive load in the present work, asking for intrinsic, extraneous 
and germane load aspects could not be confirmed by factor analytical methods to include the 
three postulated factors. Therefore, the construction of a valid differentiating subjective rating 
scale seems not to be possible. Especially the differentiation between intrinsic and germane 
load, as the corresponding items were associated with one factor, which turned out to be 
stable over the three data sets (Experiment 1-3). These results do not offer a confirmation of 
the basic assumption that learners are able to be introspective on their cognitive processes and 
to report the amount of mental effort they invested during the learning session (Paas et al., 
1994). However, many results of cognitive load research are based on this assumption. For 
clarification of these contradicting results, further research is needed. 
One option to continue with cognitive load research is to reduce the last introduced 
load type, germane cognitive load, of the historical development of Cognitive Load Theory 
(for an overview on the historical development of CLT, see Moreno & Park, 2010). It could 
be argued on the operationalization level that intrinsic and germane load are associated. For 
example, imagine learning with a high complex task (intrinsic load) and an effective learning 
strategy (germane load) introduced by some part-tasks in the learning material. Here, the 
complexity of the overall task to learn by using the strategy is higher than under the 
comparable condition without the given strategy task. Thus, a confound of intrinsic and 
germane load could be postulated and is supported by the factor analysis, which indicates that 
intrinsic and germane load are associated with one factor. 
However, on the theoretical level the two load types can be clearly differentiated: 
intrinsic load is determined by learners’ prior knowledge in combination with the complexity 
of the given task itself, and germane load is mainly defined by learners’ activity that supports 
knowledge construction and automation. Germane load is also related to prior knowledge, as 
explicitly introduced by Valcke (2002) and the statement by Pollock et al. (2002) that as long 
as there are no rudimentary schemas (prior knowledge) available in LTM, learning will hardly 
take place because of the high mental load. The difference between intrinsic and germane load 

 
126
therefore is the personal engagement that is clearly differentiated from the overall learning 
content determined by all relevant elements of the actual learning session including elements 
of the given task and elements retrieved from learners’ prior knowledge. A special case of 
learning activity, where both load types could be confounded also on the theoretical level is 
that a learner who is instructed for the first time to use a new learning strategy in addition to 
the new learning content. In this situation the argument can be made that learning strategies, 
which foster the learner to engage in learning activities could also be associated with new 
elements in the learning content, increasing the complexity of the task and intrinsic cognitive 
load. This learning strategy should be an internally self-directed one such as metacognitive 
control of the learning process. However, guided learning strategies that are introduced step-
by-step such as learning questions or mapping taks as used in the present work should not be 
interpreted as an additional element of the task itself, especially not under self-paced 
conditions. These externally presented learning tools should be interpreted as a motivator to 
engage the learner in relevant learning activities. Nevertheless, with guided learning strategies 
the risk of a confound between extraneous and germane load is much higher, as the learning 
material is extended with tools that are perhaps not relevant for learners with high prior 
knowledge resulting in the often confirmed expertise reversal effect. Thus, the seductive 
conclusion that we should reduce Cognitive Load Theory by the integration of intrinsic and 
germane load to one load type is not recommended because this would reduce the cognitive 
load framework to a very simplistic one. With only two possible load types some of the 
confounds would be prevented and it would be easier to interpret results. 
However, relevant information about the relation between working memory processes 
and learning could be lost, too. As Valcke (2002) argues, the introduction of germane 
cognitive load in Cognitive Load Theory, which seems to be linked to cognitivist views of 
learning and instruction, offers a constructivist perspective. Cognitive load research should 
continue to invest in the research question, how are learners activated to adopt techniques that 
make their mental representations more explicit. By doing so, CLT could be able to contribute 
to the foundation of the constructivist perspective as recommended by Valcke (2002). In this 
context, the main interest should be to investigate other methods which are appropriate to 
measure the differentiating theoretical construct. 
 
Which Learning Scales Should We Use to Investigate Cognitive Load Effects? 
The question about which learning scales should we use to investigate cognitive load effects 
turned out with the present research program to be relevant for further research on cognitive 

 
127
load. Learning scales are developed by theoretical contructs and often include different 
subscales such as retention and transfer scales to measure the different levels of processing. 
The cue to differentiate between the three cognitive load types could be a well differentiating 
learning scale, allowing the interpretation of observable differences in total cognitive load and 
the learning subscales. As already indicated by DeLeeuw et al. (2008) germane cognitive load 
can be measured by transfer performance. However, to use only transfer performance as an 
indicator for germane cognitive load processes is not enough because of possible confound 
with other variables such as diverse memory skills or memory capacity. This post hoc 
indicator should be combined with a valid and sensitive measure of total cognitive load to be 
interpretable. 
A new idea by the data analysis of the present work now is that it could be a solution 
for a differentiation of cognitive load to combine the results of total cognitive load with the 
results in a differentiating learning scale. High performance in transfer accompanied by high 
total cognitive load should be the indicator for germane cognitive load, while high 
performance only in retention accompanied by high total cognitive load should be the 
indicator for extraneous or intrinsic cognitive load. Thus, deep processing is indicated by high 
total cognitive load and high transfer performance, whereas strong mental effort that does not 
lead to high transfer performance and only to some retention performance because of very 
high complexity (intrinsic load) or irrelevant information (extraneous load) indicates a lower 
processing level. Instructional designers need to decide if this lower processing level is due to 
any irrelevant information or due to the complexity of the task or possibly due to both aspects. 
This last decision could be supported by the measurement of task difficulty or task 
complexity, as done in the present work which presented no differences in task difficulty 
(subjective rating) and always introduced one and the same complex learning task over the 
conditions. However, the used learning scales of the present work were different for 
Experiment 1-3. This is due to the need to show first single stable effects of each of the two 
chosen factors in one and the same learning scale and being able to analyze the data set of the 
experiment with combined factors by this appropriate learning scale. In Experiment 1, the 
learning scale was derived from a factor analysis of its data set and includes items that are 
associated 
with 
different 
levels 
of 
processing 
(deep 
processing: 
problem-
solving/comprehension and transfer items vs. low processing: retention items). In Experiment 
2 and 3 the theoretically deduced transfer subscale was used after running a factor anlysis 
without useful output to test the additivity hypothesis, because the generated new factors 

 
128
(including items associated with low levels of processing) could not replicate the single stable 
effects of the previous studies. 
An interesting point is that the learning scales, which turned out to be useful are 
associated with the induced load factors. Experiment 1, only extraneous cognitive load was 
manipulated and the learning scale that turned out to be useful is associated with retention and 
transfer. However, Experiment 2 and 3, where germane cognitive load (Experiment 2) or only 
germane cognitive load (Experiment 3) was manipulated shows effects only in the transfer 
subscale. Thus, transfer performance seems to be the common denominator to measure 
germane cognitive load, while manipulations of extraneous cognitive load also affect lower 
levels of information processing. Extraneous load factors such as modality or seductive 
details therefore affect cognitive processes that are necessary to reach high retention 
performance, for example selection processes and organization processes, as described by the 
Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2001b, 2005b); these processes can be 
destroyed by the split attention effect when material is only visually presented (no modality 
use) as well as by irrelevant learning material (seductive details) or can be fostered by 
modality use (no split attention) as well as by a minimalistic design (no seductive details). 
However, germane load factors such as mental animation tasks or support for coherence 
formation only affect transfer performance and the associated integration processes, described 
by the Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (Mayer, 2001b, 2005b). The integration 
process of multiple representations with prior knowledge can be fostered by any task which 
enourages learners to engage in effective learning activities. Support for coherence formation 
or mental animation tasks are two examples on how to foster deep processing by positive 
cognitive learning activities. 
In sum, it should be recommended to use learning scales that can differentiate between 
levels of processing, which could be derived at least from theoretical arguments. 
 
Implications for Cognitive Load Research Summerized for Each of Experiments 1-3 
To come to an overall interpretation of the present work, the question now is why these 
effects of the previous studies could not be confirmed in the 2 x 2 factorial designed 
Experiments 1-3, when two effects were induced in combination. No predicted main effects 
were found, other than one main effect of modality in Experiment 1, which can be explained 
by the interaction effect between modality and seductive details as well as one main effect of 
support for coherence formation in Experiment 2, which was only found in the generated 
learning success scale (comprehension) not used in the previous studies.  

 
129
The falsification of the additivity hypothesis by Experiment 1 indicates that we can not be 
sure of combined extraneous load effects because they could reverse under certain conditions. 
As mentioned by Ginns (2005): Cognitive Load Theory has its limits by not taking the effect 
of representation into account, therefore not assuming the existence of qualitatively different 
processing channels in human cognitive architecture. This argument is supported by results of 
Experiment 1 showing that an extraneous load factor (seductive details) could influence 
learning in a positive way when learners had enough capacities free by using different 
processing channels (audiovisual conditions) to integrate this factor. Above all, we should 
also be aware of qualitatively different levels of investment due to arousal or motivation of 
the learner and the motivational or arousing role of extraneous load factors should not be 
dismissed. This conclusion of Experiment 1 raises the following questions: 1) where does 
cognitive load begin 2) at which level does extraneous load factors begin to hurt learning? 3) 
where is the limit of extraneous load and lastly 4) how much extraneous load is necessary to 
induce an overload, destroying any learning performance? These questions demonstrate that it 
is still unclear how we could determine this investigated load type of Experiment 1 in a 
quantitative way to measure it with quantitative methods. Another question is about 
qualitative aspects of this load type: under which conditions can extraneous load factors turn 
into a germane load factor? Should we try to differentiate between extraneous load factors, 
which could elicit a motivational or an arousing process, learners need to make full use of 
their cognitive resources during learning (Moreno, 2006), and those which guarantee a 
negative effect on learning performance? By such research programs we could gain more 
information about the qualitative aspects of cognitive load and learning processes.  
The falsification of the additivity hypothesis by Experiment 2 also indicates that we can not 
be sure of compensatory effects of the combination of one extraneous and one germane load 
factor in the way Cognitive Load Theory predicts. The learning performance is comparable 
when examining learners who are confronted with a loading extraneous factor (visual-only 
material) in combination with an offloading germane factor (without support for coherence 
formation) to learners who are confronted with an offloading extraneous factor (audiovisual 
material) in combination with a loading germane factor (with support for coherence 
formation). This result is been predicted by the additivity hypothesis, but the comparison of 
these learning situations should be different from the other two conditions which combine two 
learning-enhancing factors (audiovisual material with support for coherence formation) or two 
non-conducive factors (visual-only material without support for coherence formation). When 

 
130
taking cognitive load ratings into account, which show nearly the predicted pattern, and 
assuming that these reflect learners’ mental effort, at least the combination with both load 
reducing factors (audiovisual material without support for coherence formation) should show 
the lowest cognitive load rating result in a medium level of learning success. Yet,  learners of 
this group did reach the same level of learning success comparable to all other groups and had 
the lowest invested mental effort. This indicated that the lowest invested mental effort is as 
effective as the highest investment of mental effort and the most efficient condition can be 
figured out. Thus, we could conclude that successful learning is also determineable by its 
efficiency. However, does the concluding recommendation make sense that learners should 
get instructions which allow them to learn in an efficient way (Paas et al., 1993)? 
We do not know what effect an inefficient, but also successful way of learning can 
have on other learning aspects such as the motivational processes of learners. Perhaps it is not 
as important how learners reached the learning goal, but that the goal was achieved. Many 
irrelevant detours during learning process made learners think and reflect on other things, 
which could be useful for other learning situations, and therefore show a high mental effort 
rating. As the analysis of other learning subscales indicates in Experiment 2, learners can 
reach other learning goals (main effect of support for coherence formation in comprehension, 
when time-on-task is not taken into account), which are associated with the investigated 
learning goal. This result raises the question if we need different learning success scales for 
the investigation of different load factors. In this case, it would not be possible to investigate 
cumulative effects of different load types with one and the same learning success scale. The 
same question could be posed for cognitive load measure. Is it possible that this scale is not 
measuring the total cognitive load, but only semsitive for a certain type of load as discussed 
by DeLeeuw et al. (2008) or perhaps a more sensitive one of the two investigated load 
factors? The found interaction effect in total cognitive load does not support this hypothesis. 
If this mental effort scale was more sensitive for extransous cogntive load or germane 
cognitive load, a main effect of modality (induced extraneous load) or support for coherence 
formation (induced germane load) would appear. 
Moreover, learners can reach other learning goals, which are not associated with the 
inverstigated learning goal in inefficient learning sessions with respect to the relation between 
invested mental effort and the reached learning performance. We do not know if the way the 
learning goal was reached could train other relevant basic competencies of successful learning 
like endurance, discipline, motivational balancing, error management and reflection. The 
training of these competencies could be a useful boundary effect of learning sessions which 

 
131
are not efficient, showing a high mental effort and high learning success. Thus, we should be 
careful with recommendations concerning the efficiency of leanring sessions. Learning is 
more complex than investigated in our experiments in cognitive load research and has more 
goals than just the immediately or follow-up measured learning performance. Learning goals 
of a lesson in pedagogical contexts are mostly differentiated into certain aspects to gain 
awareness of the complexity of planned lessons. Instructional designers of cognitive load 
research should formulate not only cognitive, but also motivational-emotional or affective and 
perhaps even psychomotoric learning goals, which are normally taken into account in 
classroom teaching (Kroner & Schauer, 1997). 
The falsification of the additivity hypothesis by Experiment 3 also indicates that we can not 
be sure of cumulative effects of two germane load factors in the way Cognitive Load Theory 
predicts. Thus, good learning strategies should not be combined without any proof of their 
compatibility. The results of Experiment 3 show comparable levels of reached learning 
success with or without introduced learning support (support for coherence formation and 
mental animation tasks). Not even the learning conditions where only one of the chosen 
supports was introduced could show a higher learning success of the learners within this 
condition in contrast to the learners of the support-free condition. Similar to the results of 
Experiment 2, no effects in the learning success scale are supported by the predicted pattern in 
total cognitive load, if we ignore the covariable time-on-task. Thus, the most efficient 
condition could be chosen, but still the question of how we interpret this same level of 
learning success reached under very different learning conditions remains. Perhaps a follow-
up study could clarify this result. The higher invested mental effort is only reflected in 
learning success when information has to be retrieved from long-term memory long after the 
learning session. This would be typical for positive highly loading learning strategies such as 
metacognition (Bannert, 2006) and could be one more support for the chosen germane load 
factors that these are effective for meaningful and enduring learning. However, when taking 
time-on-task into account, even this question would not be evident because both main effects 
of the learning tools support for coherence formation and mental animation on cognitive load 
disappear. The results of this last experiment raises the question: is it possible to know on 
which level an overload occures and if so, how can we measure cognitive overload? Where is 
the limit of cognitive processing? An overall overload of participants could perhaps not be 
measured by quantitative means, as the highest possible positive cognitive load (germane 

 
132
load) is dependent of learners’ memory capacity. Thus, overload could possibly not be rated 
on a subjective scale asking for the invested mental effort, but should be explicitly requested. 
One more option to define cognitive overload is to take the learning success into 
account and only interpret an overload when a certain previously determined low level of 
learning performance is only reached by the given instruction. This is what we should 
determine to be able to compare results of different cognitive load research groups working 
with diverse domain-specific tasks. Another idea concerning overload is about how learners 
handle their cognitive overload. Do learners, who are conscious about their actual overload 
reflect only on their inhibition to learn or do learners perhaps handle such situations with 
compensatory methods such as focusing only on certain part-tasks? We do not know much 
about learners’ awareness and handling of overload. This is one more research gap that should 
be overcome. The last question that is raised by Experiment 3 is, if germane cognitive load 
processes are qualitatively different and not quantitatively different, therefore not possible to 
measure by quantitative means such as “the higher the rated mental effort, the higher germane 
load” or “the higher the transfer performance, the higher germane load”. It could be that 
germane load activity has more potential than its effect on learning success. The investment to 
make full use of cognitive resources during learning could result in a more complex and 
integrated schema construction, which we do not uncover with a transfer task in post tests of 
our research programs. One research question we should invest in is: how do we measure 
these effects of invested germane load which are qualitatively better knowledge networks. 
Moreover, the subjective feeling of making full use of cognitive resources during learning 
could elicit motivation or cognitive interest (Kintsch, 1980) or even a feeling of flow 
(Csikszentmihalyi, 2000). Such effects could also influence the retrieval of the lesson learned 
in a qualitative way. Perhaps learners associate a positive feeling with the learned task and are 
more motivated to retrieve the recently stored information and to learn more about this issue. 
 
Summary of Implications for Cognitive Load Research 
With respect to our initial research question the present findings indicate the need to 
reconsider the additivity hypothesis raised by Cognitive Load Theory, which does not predict 
any interaction effect as was found in the present work. It is necessary to further investigate 
the relationship among the three load types, working memory capacity, and learning. All 
interpretations of the results in the present work with respect to the used measure of total 
cognitive load still need additional confirmation by other cognitive load measures such as 
objective measures by appropriate dual-task methods or pupillometry. In addition, cognitive 

 
133
load research should be aware of the possible differentiation between learning scale levels and 
its utility to differentiate between the associated information processing levels. The 
quintessence of Experiment 1 is that Cognitive Load Theory has its limits by not taking the 
effect of representation into account, therefore not allowing for the possibility of the existence 
of qualitatively different processing channels in human cognitive architecture. We need to 
clarify how we could determine extraneous load factors in a quantitative and/or a qualitative 
way to be able to introduce sensitive measures. The main result of Experiment 2 is that we 
cannot be sure of compensatory effects of different load factors. Thus, the often found 
concluding speculative post hoc interpretations of unexpected results in cognitive load 
research should not assume the compensation of a germane load factor by reversing into an 
extraneous load factor. With this conclusion the question raises if we need different learning 
success scales and cognitive load measures for the investigation of different load factors. 
Moreover, a discussion of learning efficiency and its practical implications have to be 
discussed in the cogntive load research community to formulate consistent practical 
implications. Experiment 3 indicates that we cannot be sure of cumulative effects of germane 
load factors. Bringing forth the questions where do we estimate the limit of positive cognitive 
load if there are any limits and how can we clearly determine and measure cognitive 
overload?  To come to the final implication: The present work not only points to the need to 
reconsider the additivity hypothesis of Cognitive Load Theory, but also to the need to develop 
valid and sensitive methods to measure total cognitive load and the assumed load types. There 
is still a lot of research to do to close all these research gaps. 
 
6.2 Boundary Effects of the Present Work and their Implications 
Two interesting boundary effects of the present work are focused in the following section. 
Experiment 1 shows an interesting interaction effect between seductive details and modality. 
This finding provides some implications for seductive details research. The fact that we 
introduced all instructions in a classroom situation and always in a self-paced design, results 
of Experiment 1 and 2 provide some implications for modality research, where self-pacing 
and classroom testing are not often investigated. 
 
Seductive Details in Present Work and Implications for Research on Seductive Details Effects 
The introduced extraneous load factor in the form of seductive details in Experiment 1 
impaired learning under the visual-only condition and fostered learning under the audiovisual 
condition. Seductive details may have a beneficial learning effect under conditions of low 

 
134
cognitive load. This is what an audiovisual condition determined in comparison with a visual-
only condition. Under an audiovisual condition, learners have much more cognitive resources 
free to use seductive details in a constructive way. In the present work, seductive details 
perhaps serverd by constructing an associative knowledge network under the audiovisual 
condition. This interpretation is supported by the higher self-reported effort of the audiovisual 
groups. However, these findings run counter to the mentioned seductive details studies in the 
theoretical portion of the present work and results of the preliminary seductive details study 
conducted for the present work. Suggesting and showing that learners’ attention is distracted 
when seductive details are presented. Moreover, cognitive processes of selecting relevant 
information and organizing this information into a coherent mental model seem to be fostered 
by the introduced seductive details in the low loading audiovisual condition in Experiment 1. 
Following the predictions of the Arousal Theory, which suggests an inverted u-shaped 
relation between arousal and performance (Broadhurst, 1959; Hebb, 1955), this found pattern 
can be explained. The medium arousal level, which was induced by the seductive details, 
resulted in the highest learning performance. Interestingly, this approach was recently 
confirmed for learners with high levels of memory capacity (Park et al., 2009). In this study, 
memory capacity was determined in the sense of structuring and organizing information in 
working memory by providing information with retrieval cues to facilitate rapid retrieval 
during learning processes. Results of this study demosntrated that learners with high levels of 
memory capacity not only knew how to integrate interesting and content-related, but 
irrelevant background music (seductive detail), but also reached a higher learning 
performance with background music as compared to learners with medium levels of memory 
capacity, who learned significantly better under the music-free condition (Park et al., 2009). 
The relevance of this aptitude variable as well as the results of the present study indicate that 
learners learn better with seductive details in a low loading condition (audiovisual) which 
supports the Arousal Theory at least under certain conditions. 
The only question we should pose now is, where do learners spend the freed working 
memory capacity by low loading conditions or the given aptitude of memory capacity. This is 
a point Moreno (2006) argues,  that students need to become motivated to make full use of 
their cognitive resources in productive ways. And that the motivational or arousing role of 
seductive details should not be dismissed, as this sort of additional information could be an 
answer on how to motivate learners effectively. Future research needs investigate the potential 
anchoring, arousing or motivational function that seductive details may play in multimedia 

 
135
learning. This boundary effect of the present work is only one example of how and the 
prevalent principles of multimedia instruction could also reverse under certain conditions. 
 
Modality in Present Work and Implications for Research on Modality Effects 
In the present work, the modality effect was first confirmed for university students working 
with the present learning material under a system-paced condition (see Seufert et al., 2009). 
All other studies of the present work are based on a self-paced version of the same material. 
Thus, the modality effect was also confirmed under the self-paced condition in Experiment 1 
(t(48) = 1.67, p = .05) in a subscale associated with retention performance, when only 
considering the data of this experiment of the two seductive details-free conditions (n = 50). 
The interaction effect between seductive details and modality of this experiment is one more 
confirmation for a modality effect with the present self-paced material, showing that with 
seductive details, which were only presented on 4 of the 11 screens in the learning material, 
the modality effect appears in a large extent (Contrast: F(1, 96) = 10.63, p < .01), too. 
Moreover, the modality effect was confirmed under the self-paced condition in Experiment 2 
(t(46) = 1.66, p = .05) in a subscale associated with retention performance, when only 
considering the data of this experiment of the two support for coherence formation-free 
conditions (n = 48). In addition, a post hoc analysis, which includes all single conditions of 
Experiment 1 (without seductive details, n = 50) and Experiment 2 (without support for 
coherence formation, n = 48) as well as the control conditions of the two previous studies 
(visual-only condition without any treatment, n = 27) also confirms that learners learn better 
under the audiovisual condition (t(123) = 1.70, p < .05). The interesting fact that all these 
effects are found on subscales, which are associated with retention performance, has to be 
interpreted as a special modality effect under self-paced condition. 
In the previous study testing the modality effect with the system-paced version of the 
present material (Seufert et al., 2009), the modality effect was found in transfer performance, 
according to the majority of the system-based studies mentioned by a metaanalysis of Ginns 
(2005). Thus, the present work leads to the conclusion that modality effects in system-paced 
instructions are mostly found in transfer performance, while modality effects in self-paced 
instructions seem to be typical in retention performance. This signifies that learners under 
system-paced conditions concentrate on lower level processes like selecting and organizing 
relevant information and the integration is only possibly under low loading conditions, such 
as working with audiovisual material. In comparison to such a stressful situation of only 
having a limited time-on-task and being forced to find out the most relevant information to 

 
136
get the chance to integrate it, a self-paced condition allows deeper processing, which depends 
on the learners invested mental effort. Learners seem to concentrate more on integration 
processes and to understand the given information on an abstract level, without necessarily 
knowing the explicitly used terms. Thus, it is possible to reach a high transfer performance, 
but not to be able to remember explicitly certain special terms of the lesson learned. A low 
loading audiovisual condition however seems to support the construction of explicit 
knowledge, such as remembering certain terms. This could be due to the advantage of 
information processing through the audio channel, when learners learn with auditory 
presented material: Learners know how the new terms are spoken out by a professional, 
which could be reheared during the lesson and is especially useful for special terms such as 
“Adenosintriphosphat” of the present instruction on ATP-Synthase. Moreover, the 
performance to differentiate between similar written, but different words on the semantic level 
such as the differentiation of “ATP-Synthese” and “ATP-Synthase” is fosterd by narration. 
Thus, we know now how to explain why the modality effect turns out on different learning 
subscales in dependence of pacing. This implicates for the present work that we should have 
tested the additivity hypothesis in Experiment 1 and 2 on a retention subscale and not as 
already done on an overall learning scale (Experiment 1) or even on a transfer scale 
(Experiment 2). What does this mean for the presented falsification of the additivity 
hypothesis of Cognitive Load Theory? 
In Experiment 1, no other effects were found on other learning subscales, which could 
support the additivity hypothesis (no effects at all or only the same pattern as shown in the 
present work). In the present work, learning scales were chosen, which could show single 
effects in the priliminary studies. Following the argument of modality effects in self-paced 
instructions for Experiment 1 also a retention subscale could have been chosen. However, in 
retention performance no effects turned out by the analysis of variance with the two factors 
modality and seductive details, even though the previous seductive details study also showed 
effects in retention performance. The same conclusion can be drawn for Experiment 2, where 
support for coherence formation was combined with modality. There were no effects found on 
either subscales, beside the main effect of support for coherence formation in comprehension 
performance, when not considering the covariable time-on-task. As already discussed, the 
problem of combining two different load type factors (extraneous and germane) could result 
in the problem that the combined effect cannot be measured on the same learning scale 
(neither on retention and transfer nor on an overall learning scale). Thus, the fact that we did 
not find an effect in Experiment 2, which would support the additivity hypothesis, could be 

 
137
due to the methodological problem that the modality effect in self-paced instruction can only 
be found in retention performance while the support for coherence formation could only be 
found in transfer performance. In sum, by using subscales the conclusion that we have to 
consider is the difference between self-paced and system-paced modality effects. The 
additivity hypothesis is not supported as well. In addition, what does the conclusion that 
modality effects in system-paced instructions are normally found in transfer performance, 
while modality effects in self-paced instructions seem to appear in retention performance 
mean for the found interaction effect in Experiment 1? Under the self-paced condition a 
modality effect is shown in an overall learning scale, not only in retention as expected by 
following the arguments above, but also in comprehension and transfer performance, when 
interesting but irrelevant learning material is included. 
Thus, to instruct by the appropriate modality is also useful under self-paced 
conditions, not only to foster retention performance, but also comprehension and transfer 
performance and therefore meaningful learning. However, these results contradict the actual 
state of research showing that the modality effect can disappear in case of self-pacing and 
even reverses in the way that visual-only material is superior to audiovisual material (Tabbers, 
2002; Tabbers, Martens & van Merriënboer, 2004). The results around Tabbers are based on 
studies using learning material outside sciences, in detail a multimedia lesson on the subject 
of instructional design, consisting of diagrams and explanatory text. In this case, spatial 
ability or the mental animation of the presented instruction is not as important in biology or 
geometry, for instance. The processing of process information, such as interacting and parallel 
processes for example in a molecule, seems to be the criterion, when the modality effect also 
appears under a self-paced condition. To come to a final interpretation of these contradicting 
results, more research is needed using learning contents of different domains. 
In sum, the results of the present work indicate for research on modality effects that 
modality plays also an important role under self-paced instructions and more research is 
needed to investigate this more natural setting without time restriction to get insights into 
deep processing during learning and how to foster it. 
 
6.3 Practical Implications of the Present Work 
The present work also provides practical implications. However, all the presented conclusions 
should be considered carefully because of the low values in most cases of reported partial 
effect sizes only reaching from etap² = .04 to .19. Thus, all studies presented here should be 
confirmed by other studies, which introduce learning material of other domains. The 

 
138
following conclusions can be summarized for self-paced learning instructions: Learners need 
appropriate instructions to be able to tap their full potential of their working memory capacity. 
This can be done through the use of diverse learning-enhancing tools such as support for 
coherence formation, mental animation tasks or by presenting the material in an audiovisual 
design and avoiding seductive details. These first practical implications are derieved from all 
studies of the present work, which show single effects of all four mentioned optimizing 
instructional treatments. However, the combination of these treatments and of other 
optimizing strategies is not recommended without any proof about its effectiveness. No 
cumulative effects could be confirmed at least for the presented optimizing treatments. 
Moreover, one interesting practical implication with respect to seductive details is that they 
have a potential beneficial effect. When introduced in instruction, which takes the limitations 
and architecture of our cognitive system into account, seductive details can affect learning in a 
positive way. This has not been considered until now. Experiment 1 suggests that when the 
given instruction is optimally designed (minimal extraneous load realized by audiovisual 
presentation), seductive details may promote learning because learners have the necessary 
working memory capacity to make meaningful associations between the presented seductive 
details and the relevant lesson materials. Seductive details may help learning by adding 
anchors to the learners’ constructed mental model. Anchors are interesting, realistic contexts, 
examples, or events that encourage the active construction of knowledge by learners 
(Cognition & Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1993). However, future research needs to 
investigate the potential anchoring function of seductive details in multimedia learning to 
clarify this practical implication. 
 
6.4 Future Directions 
How should we go on with Cognitive Load Research, when considering all results, 
conclusions and implications of the present work? In sum, the implications for cognitive load 
research, for research on modality and seductive details effects as well as practical 
implications all point to the need to investigate the following three aspects. First, we should 
invest in the development of valid and sensitive methods to measure total cognitive load and 
its load types. Second, we should focus on measuring different levels of processing, for 
example by the differentiation of learning scales. Third, we should invest more in 
motivational aspects and the functions of arousal and affects. In addition, I recommend 
conducting Aptitude-Treatment-Interaction studies with possible relevant aptitude variables to 

 
139
get further insights into all three aspects listed above. How we should invest in these three 
aspects and ATI-studies is presented in the following lines. 
The development of valid and sensitive methods to measure total cognitive load and 
its load types has already begun with the first versions of Cognitive Load Theory (see Moreno 
et al., 2010). The options of measuring cognitive load classified by objectivity and causal 
relationship are summarized by Brünken et al. (2003; see Chapter 2.6), who recommend 
objective measures. However, the most frequently used method in Cogntive Load Research is 
still the subjective rating scale of Paas (1992). Disadvantages of this method are more and 
more obvious by the results of current studies. Especially the question if learners are able to 
estimate their mental effort. Moreover, if they are able to measure their mental effort, how can 
we compare subjective ratings in our experiments with between-subject designs? Many 
studies were conducted with other methods such as the dual-task method (Brünken et al., 
2002; Brünken et al., 2003, 2004; Chandler et al., 1996; Marcus et al., 1996; Renkl, et al. 
2003; van Gerven et al., 2002) or eye-tracking (Jarodzka et al., 2010; Recarte et al., 2003; 
Van Gog et al., 2010; Scheiter et al., 2009). The dual-task method is clearly associated with 
cognitive load in contrast to eye-tracking, which does not provide a strong causal relationship 
to cognitive load. Nevertheless, the recently developed method to measure beside the 
movement of pupils also its dilation, which is a more reliable and valid estimate of individual 
cognitive load (Clark et al., 2010; see also Chapter 2.6) should be the most frequently used 
method in future research. The questions about how we could determine extraneous load 
factors in a quantitative and/or qualitative way to be able to introduce sensitive measures for 
this specific load type could perhaps be answered by using this new method of pupillometry. 
The other questions about where do we estimate the limit of germane cognitive load, if there 
are any limits, and how we can clearly determine and measure cognitive overload could be 
investigated with this recently developed and highly recommended method as well. 
Moreover, we should focus on measuring different levels of processing, for example 
by the differentiation of learning scales. The recommendation to measure not only retention 
performance as an indicator for learning success, but also transfer performance has been 
supported by many studies (see for example the metaanalysis of Ginns, 2005). However, we 
could gain more information by precisely differentiating between retention and transfer 
performance, as well as between the performance of remembering process and structural 
information and the according transfer performances. The options to differentiate between 
these performance levels is highly dependent on the given task. Thus, we should not only use 
complex tasks, defined by their element-interactivity (van Merrienboer, 1997), but also tasks 

 
140
that include structural as well as process information, requiring mental animation for 
comprehension. In addition, the argument that retention is a prerequisite for transfer is not 
always valid, as in some cases it is possible to understand the whole process of a given task 
without explicit knowledge of certain terms, by which retention performance is often 
operationalized and measured. This is only one method of how we are able to take different 
levels of processing into account. Further research should invest in the development of other 
methods to clearly differentiate between qualitatively different processing levels. New 
methods of measuring total cognitive load or different load types in combination with reliable 
and valid methods of measuring different processing levels will provide further insights into 
the relation among the three load types, working memory capacity and learning. 
In addition, in future research on cognitive load, we should consider motivational 
aspects. The individual level of motivation before, during and after the lesson provides 
information about how instructions should be designed to foster deep processing and the 
interest to learn more about the given task. Learners need to become motivated to make full 
use of their cognitive resources in productive ways to reach their best performance (Moreno, 
2006). Thus, we should try to confirm that the instructions in use are not only resulting in a 
high learning performance, but also in higher motivation of the learner. By measuring arousal, 
affects, moods or motivation during learning, we will gain relevant information about the 
relation between motivation, cognitive load and learning. 
Finally, Aptitude-Treatment-Interaction studies serve to uncover interactions between 
our found effects of factors such as modality, seductive details, support for coherence 
formation or mental animation and certain aptitude variables, which are associated with 
cognitive load. Associated variables are variables such as working memory capacity, memory 
capacity and specific memory skills. Seufert et al. (2009) give an example on how to do so 
and how to analyze these data by regression analysis with the “re-centering” method 
recommended by Aiken and West (1991). By conducting ATI-studies, we will gain more 
information about which aptitude variables are responsible for high cognitive load and 
intensive learning. In addition, this could be useful for practical implications, especially with 
respect to adaptive learning-systems that take prerequisites or characteristics of learners into 
account to foster positive cognitive load during learning. 
Further research, which accounts for these three aspects of valid and sensitive methods 
to measure cognitive load, different levels of processing and motivational functions will 
contribute to moving Cognitive Load Research in a constructive direction. Such contributions 
and the investment in more ATI-studies will perhaps result in a more recent and less 

 
141
simplistic version of Cognitive Load Theory, which is not based on the additivity hypothesis 
that has been falsified by the present work. As „…we should concede as cognitive scientists, 
that valid criticisms can be raised against any existing theory of cognition and that such 
criticism is essential to progress.” (Moreno, 2006, p. 179), I am closing the present work full 
of valid critiques with these lines and looking forward to observe and shape the next steps of 
progress in Cognitive Load Research.

Appendices (in German) 
Appendix A: Instruction for Conditions with Support for Coherence Formation 
Wie zu Beginn schon kurz erwähnt, möchten wir herausfinden, wie multimediale 
Lernumgebungen gestaltet sein müssen, damit ihr gut lernen könnt und einen hohen 
Lernerfolg erreicht. Wir beschäftigen uns im Moment mit Lernstrategien. Sie haben die 
Funktion den Lernprozess zu regulieren. Sie helfen die Energie, die in das Lernen investiert 
wird auf die tatsächlich relevanten Aspekte zu lenken und sollen euch dabei unterstützen, 
intensiver zu lernen.  
Wir möchten mit Lernstrategien erreichen, dass das Lernen erfolgreicher wird; ihr also am 
Ende mehr und besser gelernt habt. Ihr bekommt heute von uns zusätzliche Lernfragen und 
Zuordnungsaufgaben, die während des Lernens auf den verschiedenen Lernseiten 
eingeblendet werden. Sie sollen Seite für Seite sicherstellen, dass ihr wichtige Informationen 
wahrgenommen und verstanden habt. 
Eure Aufgabe ist es zu lernen und zusätzlich diese Fragen so gut wie möglich zu beantworten 
und die Zuordnungsaufgaben so gut wie möglich zu bearbeiten. Damit die Lernfragen und 
Zuordnungsaufgaben wirken können, ist es sehr wichtig, beim Antworten nicht zu raten, 
sondern gut zu überlegen.  
Die Lernfragen sind im Multiple Choice Format angelegt. Es können eine oder mehrere 
Antworten richtig sein. Um bewusst zu antworten könnt ihr beispielsweise die eine gegen die 
andere Antwortmöglichkeit abwägen, Antworten ausschließen und am Ende eine überlegte 
Entscheidung treffen. Ihr bekommt eine Rückmeldung über die Richtigkeit eurer Antwort. Ist 
eine Antwort falsch, hilft es euch zusätzlich darüber nachzudenken, warum ihr falsch gelegen 
habt und diese Stelle auf der Lernseite noch mal anzusehen und nachzuvollziehen, warum die 
andere Antwort richtig war. 
Bei den Zuordnungsaufgaben, müsst ihr vorgegebene Begriffe zu Bildausschnitten zuordnen. 
Bei diesem Lernprogramm sind die Informationen, die in den Bildern stecken sehr wichtig für 
das Verständnis. Da man dazu neigt, Bilder nur kurz zu überfliegen und deshalb ein großer 
Teil der wichtigen Bildinformationen gar nicht wahrgenommen wird, sollen euch die 
Zuordnungsaufgaben unterstützen, euch gezielt mit dem Bild zu beschäftigen und wichtige 
Informationen zu erkennen. Auch hier gilt: Die Aufgaben bringen euch nur dann etwas, wenn 
ihr sie ernsthaft bearbeitet und die Rückmeldung über die Richtigkeit dazu nutzt, zu 
verstehen, warum vielleicht Fehler aufgetaucht sind.

Habt ihr dazu Fragen? Viel Spaß und Erfolg beim Lernen!  
 
Appendix B: Instruction for Conditions with Mental Animation Tasks 
Wie zu Beginn schon kurz erwähnt, möchten wir herausfinden, wie multimediale

intensiver zu lernen.  
Wir möchten mit Lernstrategien erreichen, dass das Lernen erfolgreicher wird; ihr also am 
Ende mehr und besser gelernt habt. Ihr bekommt heute von uns einige zusätzliche Lernfragen 
und Zuordnungsaufgaben, die während des Lernens auf den verschiedenen Lernseiten 
eingeblendet werden. Das sind die Seiten mit den blaufarbenen Kästchen, in denen 
sogenannte mental animation Aufgaben erscheinen. Sie sollen zum besseren Verständnis der 
verschiedenen Prozesse, die im Lernmaterial vorkommen verhelfen. Sie heißen mental 
animation Aufgaben, da ihr euch zur Lösung dieser Aufgaben den Lerninhalt innerlich also 
mental genau vorstellen müsst, und zwar vor allem wie die einzelnen Elemente vom 
Lernmaterial sich bewegen, deshalb animation. Die Aufgaben sollen euch also dazu 
verhelfen, sich die ganzen Bewegungsabläufe genauer vorstellen zu können und dadurch den 
Lerninhalt besser zu verstehen.  
Eure Aufgabe ist es zu lernen und zusätzlich diese mental animation Aufgaben so gut wie 
möglich zu lösen. Damit diese mental animation Aufgaben wirken können, ist es sehr wichtig, 
beim Antworten nicht zu raten, sondern gut zu überlegen. Die mental animation Aufgaben 
bestehen aus Lernfragen und Zuordnungsaufgaben: 
Die Lernfragen sind im Multiple Choice Format angelegt. Es können eine oder mehrere

eingeblendet werden. Sie sollen Seite für Seite sicherstellen, dass ihr wichtige Informationen 
wahrgenommen und verstanden habt. 
Es gibt neben den Seite für Seite in orangefarbenen Fenstern erscheinenden Lernfragen auch 
ab und zu sogenannte mental animation Aufgaben in blaufarbenen Fenstern. Sie sollen zum 
besseren Verständnis der verschiedenen Prozesse, die im Lernmaterial vorkommen verhelfen. 
Sie heißen mental animation Aufgaben, da ihr euch zur Lösung dieser Aufgaben den 
Lerninhalt innerlich also mental genau vorstellen müsst, und zwar vor allem wie die einzelnen 
Elemente vom Lernmaterial sich bewegen, deshalb animation. Die Aufgaben sollen euch also 
dazu verhelfen, sich die ganzen Bewegungsabläufe genauer vorstellen zu können und dadurch 
den Lerninhalt besser zu verstehen.

Eure Aufgabe ist es zu lernen und zusätzlich die normalen Lernfragen und diese mental 
animation Aufgaben so gut wie möglich zu lösen. Damit die Lernfragen und mental 
animation Aufgaben wirken können, ist es sehr wichtig, beim Antworten nicht zu raten, 
sondern gut zu überlegen. Die Lernfragen und mental animation Aufgaben bestehen aus 
Lernfragen und Zuordnungsaufgaben: 
Die Lernfragen sind im Multiple Choice Format angelegt. Es können eine oder mehrere 
Antworten richtig sein. Um bewusst zu antworten könnt ihr beispielsweise die eine gegen die 
andere Antwortmöglichkeit abwägen, Antworten ausschließen und am Ende eine überlegte 
Entscheidung treffen. Ihr bekommt eine Rückmeldung über die Richtigkeit eurer Antwort. Ist 
eine Antwort falsch, hilft es euch zusätzlich darüber nachzudenken, warum ihr falsch gelegen 
habt und diese Stelle auf der Lernseite noch mal anzusehen und nachzuvollziehen, warum die 
andere Antwort richtig war. 
Bei den Zuordnungsaufgaben, müsst ihr vorgegebene Begriffe zu Bildausschnitten zuordnen. 
Bei diesem Lernprogramm sind die Informationen, die in den Bildern stecken sehr wichtig für 
das Verständnis. Da man dazu neigt, Bilder nur kurz zu überfliegen und deshalb ein großer 
Teil der wichtigen Bildinformationen gar nicht wahrgenommen wird, sollen euch die 
Zuordnungsaufgaben unterstützen, euch gezielt mit dem Bild zu beschäftigen und wichtige 
Informationen und Prozesse zu erkennen. Auch hier gilt: Die Aufgaben bringen euch nur dann 
etwas, wenn ihr sie ernsthaft bearbeitet und die Rückmeldung über die Richtigkeit dazu nutzt, 
zu verstehen, warum vielleicht Fehler aufgetaucht sind.  
Habt ihr dazu Fragen? Viel Spaß und Erfolg beim Lernen!
