Abstract. 
In the conclusion 
of [7] Halpern 
and Moses expressed 
their interest in a logical system 
in which 
one could 
talk about 
knowledge 
and belief (and belief about 
knowledge, 
knowledge 
about 
belief and so on), We investigate 
such systems. 
In the first part of the paper 
knowledge 
and belief, 
without 
time, are considered. 
Common 
knowledge 
and common 
belief are defined 
and compared. 
A logical 
system 
and a family 
of models 
are proposed, 
a completeness 
result is 
proved 
and a decision 
procedure 
described. 
In the second 
part of the paper, 
time is considered. 
Different 
notions 
of beliefs 
are distinguished, 
obeying 
different 
properties 
of persistence. 
One 
interpretation 
of belief which obeys a very strong 
persistence 
axiom 
is put forward 
and used in 
the analysis 
of the “wise men” puzzle. 
1. Introduction 
Reasoning 
about 
knowledge 
and belief has been recently 
proposed 
as a tool for 
describing 
distributed 
systems, as well as many real-life 
situations. 
Examples 
include 
synchronization 
and 
cooperation 
protocols, 
cryptographic 
systems, 
games, 
economics, 
knowledge 
bases 
and 
intelligent 
programs. 
One 
of the outstanding 
questions 
is what is the best concept 
for analysing 
such situations: 
knowledge 
or 
belief. Following 
previous 
authors 
[5] it may be considered 
that the main difference 
between 
knowledge 
and belief 
is that when one knows 
p, then p is true, but when 
one believes 
p, then p must not be true. Some recent works examine 
the concept 
of 
knowledge 
[6,7,9] 
and others the concept 
of belief [ 10,2,3]. 
We think as suggested 
by Halpern 
and Moses in [7], that for some applications 
a good system has to be 
able to talk about 
belief 
and knowledge. 
We want to express 
statements 
such as 
“person 
i believes 
p and knows 
q”, or “person 
i believes 
that if he does not know 
p, then 
q is true”, 
and so on. In this paper 
we propose 
a logical 
system for many 
people 
that includes 
belief, 
knowledge, 
common 
knowledge 
and common 
belief. 
Following 
Lewis [ll] 
the notion 
of common 
belief of some state of affairs A in a 
population 
P holds if and only if: 
“(1) everyone 
in P has reason 
to believe that A holds; 
(2) A indicates 
to everyone 
in P that everyone 
in P has reason 
to believe that 
A holds; 
(3) A indicates 
to everyone 
in P that everyone 
in P.. . ” 
Lewis [ 1 l] calls this concept 
common 
knowledge, 
but we think the term common 
belief is more appropriate. 
The notion 
of common 
belief is much weaker than the 
0304-3975/88/$3.50

Science 
Publishers 
B.V. (North-Holland) 

156 
S. Kraus. D. Lehmann 
notion 
of common 
knowledge. 
Even when a is true and is common 
belief, 
a must 
not be common 
knowledge. 
We think that in some cases, in particular 
those envisaged 
by Lewis, common 
belief is the proper 
concept 
and not common 
knowledge. 
Another 
issue 
is how belief 
and 
knowledge 
are changing 
in time. 
In some 
circumstances, 
one cannot 
say anything 
nontrivial 
about 
the effect of the passage 
of time on knowledge 
or belief, but in others one would like to state that knowledge 
is never lost (see [9]) and that beliefs do not change without reason. When discussing 
the relation 
of belief and time one cannot 
escape the conclusion 
that there is more 
than one notion 
of belief. 
So, we add “time” 
to our system and for two different 
notions 
of belief 
we suggest 
different 
axioms 
to express 
the persistence 
of beliefs 
and common 
beliefs. 
Finally 
we use one of our systems 
to partly 
analyse 
the “wise men” 
puzzle, 
(see 
[l]) in a completely 
formal 
way. 
2. Logic of knowledge 
and belief 
We now consider 
knowledge 
and belief alone 
(without 
time). 
2.1. The language 
Suppose 
a 
set 
Pvar 
of 
propositional 
variables 
and 
a 
finite 
set 
People = def { 1,2, . . . , n} of participants 
are given. 
The following 
rules define 
the 
set of formulas 
lY 
(1) A propositional 
variable 
p E Pvar is a formula 
If a and b are formulas 
of r and if i E People, then the following 
are formulas 
of I-: 
(2) ia 
(not a) and a v b (a or b), 
(3) Kia (i knows 
a) and B,a (i believes 
a). 
(4) Yta (a is common 
knowledge) 
and %?I (a is common 
belief). 
In this language 
one can express pure knowledge 
formulas, 
pure belief formulas, 
but one can also express 
formulas 
like K,a + B,a that means that person 
i believes 
what he knows, 
or 1Bia f, K,lB,a 
that means 
that person 
i does not believe 
a iff 
he knows that he does not believe 
a. Let us define the connectives 
Z? and 9 by 
del 
2?a = 
A 
K,a, 
it People 
def 
%a = 
r\ 
B,a. 
I c People 
The formula 
8a means 
that everybody 
knows 
a and 
9a 
means 
that everybody 
believes 
a. 
2.2. The models 
We use possible-worlds 
semantics 
for knowledge 
and belief. Person 
i knows 
a if 
a is true in all the worlds 
that according 
to his knowledge 
could be possible, 
and 

Knowledge, belief and rime 
157 
person 
i believes 
a if a is true in all the worlds 
that could be possible 
according 
to his beliefs. 
We shall now define models 
in the style of Kripke 
with two binary 
relations 
for each person: 
one relation 
corresponding 
to worlds possible 
according 
to knowledge, 
and the other relation 
corresponding 
to the worlds believed 
possible. 
Definition 
2.1. A model 
JZ? is a structure 
(S, s, 1, =, , -2, . . . , =,,, -, , -2, . . , -,) 
where 
(1) S is a set, elements 
of S will be called states; 
(2) s E S is the real state of the world; 
(3) 1:s+2p”“’ 
says which of the propositional 
variables 
are true in each state; 
(4) for every i E People, 
the relations 
si and si satisfy the following 
rules: 
(a) =, is an equivalence 
relation 
(reflexive, 
transitive 
and symmetric), 
(b) -i 
is serial (for all s E S there is some f E S such that s -, t), 
(c) -I 
is contained 
in =; (-, G =,), 
(d) foranys,t,uESifs=,tand 
t-iu,thens-,u. 
The intuitive 
meanings 
of the relations 
-i 
and --; are the following. 
Two states 
s, u E S are in relation 
si 
if the knowledge 
of person 
i cannot 
enable 
him to 
distinguish 
between 
s and u. Two states s, u are in relation 
-; 
if in states s person 
i believes that state u is a state the world could be in. The relation 
si is an equivalence 
relation 
and its intuitive 
meaning 
is that all the states in S are divided into equivalence 
classes, and if person 
i is in state u E S and if u is member 
of the equivalence 
class 
E L S, then all the states that are member 
of E (including 
u) are possible 
according 
to his knowledge. 
In every state that person 
i could be in, there is at least one state that he believes 
is possible, 
and therefore 
-i 
is serial. 
It is easier to believe 
something 
than to know it, because 
one knows 
only true 
things. 
So one’s beliefs 
can enable 
him to distinguish 
between 
more states than 
one’s knowledge, 
and therefore 
there could be some states s, u E S such that s =, u 
but s 7Li u. On the other hand, 
one believes 
in what one knows and therefore 
-I is 
contained 
in si. 
The interesting 
condition 
of the relations 
=i and --; is condition 
d. This condition 
means 
that if s, t, u E S, if s, t are both possible 
according 
to the 
knowledge 
of person 
i, and if, when he is in state t, he believes 
that u is possible, 
he also believes 
that u is possible 
when he is in state s, since he cannot 
distinguish 
between 
t and s. 
We may prove some basic properties 
of -,. 
Lemma 
2.2. zi is euclidean and transitive. 
Proof. 
Suppose 
s, t, u E S and s -i t and s -i u. In order to prove that li is euclidean 
we have to prove that t -i u. Ifs -, t, then t =; s because 
^I, is contained 
in =i and 
-, 
is symmetric. 
However 
s -i u, therefore 
t -, u by condition 
(4)(d) in Definition 
2.1. 

158 
S. Kraus, D. Lehmann 
Suppose 
s, t, u E S and s -i t and t -i 1.4. In order to prove that -i 
is transitive 
we have to prove that s -, u. If s -i t, then s = f t because 
-i 
is contained 
in = i. 
However 
t -i u and we may conclude 
that s -i u by condition 
(4)(d) in Definition 
2.1. 
0 
Let us now define two other binary 
relations 
corresponding 
to the connectives 
= i 
and ^li: 
where + represents 
transitive 
closure. 
It is easy to see that =* is also reflexive 
and 
symmetric 
because 
every 
= i is reflexive 
and 
symmetric. 
Therefore 
=* 
is an 
equivalence 
relation. 
On the contrary, 
- * is transitive 
but not necessarily 
reflexive 
or 
symmetric. 
Suppose 
now 
that 
a 
model 
JZX =(S, s, 1, =,, 
Ed,. 
. , -,,, 
--I> -2,. 
. . , -n 
) is given. 
For any state u we shall define 
the truth 
value 
of any 
formula 
a E lY 
Definition 2.3. If p E Pvar, then p($ = trueap 
E Z(u). For formulas 
a and b of r, 
ia]“, 
= true e 
~2\,‘~, 
= false, 
a v bl,> = true e 
aI;{ = true or bl”, = true, 
K+l,y, = true e 
for all states t such that u =; t, one has al’,, = true, 
BiaI”, = true e 
for all states t such that u -i t, one has ~1,‘~~ 
= true, 
Xull;, = true ti 
for all states t such that u = * t, one has ~1.;~ = true, 
%ul~, = true e 
for all states t such that u -* t, one has u],!~, = true. 
The definition 
above is clearly 
a correct 
definition 
by induction 
on the structure 
of the formula 
a. Satisfaction 
and validity 
will now be defined 
in the usual way. 
Definition 2.4. Let JU be a model 
as above 
and a a formula 
of lY We say that J! 
satisfies 
a and write &!=a 
iff ul;l = true. 
Definition 2.5. A formula 
a is valid (+ a) iff it is satisfied 
by all models. 
2.3. The logics 
Our logics are best viewed 
as composed 
of a number 
of levels. The first level 
concerns 
classical 
propositional 
calculus: 
(AO) A suitable 
axiomatization 
of the propositional 
calculus; 
(RO) (Modus 
Ponens) 
If +a and +a + b then +b. 
The second level concerns 
general 
truths about knowledge 
and common 
knowledge 
as found 
in [9] (+ 
associates 
to the right): 
(Al) 
K,(a+b)+K,u+K,b 
for any iEPeople; 

Knowledge, belief and rime 
159 
(A2) Kia + a for any 
i E People; 
(A3) lK,a 
+ K,lK,a 
for any 
i E People; 
(A4) X(a+b)+Xu+Yib; 
(A5) 
Xa + K,a for any 
i E People; 
(A6) Xa + KJCa for any i E People; 
(A7) ?“(a+ 
&~)+a+%-u; 
(Rl) 
common 
knowledge 
generalization: 
if t-a, then EXa. 
The third level concerns 
general 
truths about 
belief and common 
belief: 
(AS) B,(a + 6) + B,a + Bib for any 
i E People 
(what person 
i believes 
is closed 
under 
Modus 
Ponens); 
(A9) lB,false 
for any i E People (person 
i does not believe contradictory 
things); 
(AlO) 
%‘(a + 6) -+ %u --, Sib (common 
belief is closed under 
Modus 
Ponens); 
(Al 1) %u + 9a (if something 
is common 
belief, then everybody 
believes 
it); 
(A12) 
%?a + %%a (if something 
is common 
belief, then everybody 
believes 
that 
it is common 
belief); 
(A13) 
B(a -+ Su)-+ 
%I + L&J (induction 
rule). 
The lust and most interesting 
level describes 
the interrelation 
between 
knowledge 
and belief, 
and betweeen 
common 
knowledge 
and common 
belief. 
(A14) 
K,a + B,a for any 
i E People 
(one believes 
everything 
one knows); 
(A15) 
B,a+KiB,a 
for any 
iE People 
(one knows 
about 
his own beliefs: 
beliefs 
are conscious); 
(A16) 
YCa + 93~1 (anything 
that is common 
knowledge 
is common 
belief). 
Axiom 
(A16) is needed 
to ensure 
that theorems 
are common 
beliefs. 
We want to 
emphasize 
that the interesting 
formula 
B,a + B,K,a 
is not included 
in our system. 
It would 
imply tB,ut,K,a. 
We now list some interesting 
theorems 
that can be proved from the axioms above 
and will be used later: 
K,la

for any i E People, 
B,a - K,B,a

Theorem2.6. 
Axioms 
(AO)-(A16) 
and the rules of inference 
(RO)-(Rl) 
are sound 
and complete for the notion of validity defined above and validity may be decided in 
deterministic 
exponential 
time. 
Proof. 
The proof of the soundness 
is obvious. 
The completeness 
result proceeds 
by 
building 
a “universal” 
model, 
i.e., a model in which states are labelled 
by traces of 
suitable 
size in such a way that formulas 
true at state s are exactly those formulas 
that appear 
in the label 
of s. This proof 
is similar 
to the corresponding 
proof in 
[12], but is different 
in some interesting 
details. 
Some standard 
notions, 
such as 
complete 
and consistent 
theory 
are supposed 
to be known: 
see, for example, 
[12] 
for definitions. 
First we shall define a set of formulas 
to be considered. 
Remark: 
In all the following 
definitions 
i E People and i is implicitly 
universally 
quantified. 
Definition 
2.7. If a E r, we define 
A(a) 
to be the smallest 
subset of r satisfying: 
(a) a E A(a); 
(b) A(a) 
is closed under 
subformulas; 
(c) if b E A (a) and b does not begin by a negation, 
then lb E A (a); 
(d) if KibEA(a), 
then BibEd 
and B,KjbEA(a); 
(e) if XbEA(a), 
then K,XbEA(a), 
K,bEA(a) 
and CBbEA(a); 
(f) 
if SIbEd( 
then B@bEA(a) 
and B,bEA(a). 
It is easy to see that the size of A (a) is linear 
in the length 
of a. 
Now, we want to restrict 
our attention 
to those subsets 
of r that are reasonable 
candidates 
for labels. 
Definition 
2.8. Let E c r be closed under 
subformulas. 
DE E is a standard 
set on 
E if it satisfies: 
(a) if 1bE 
E, 1bE 
Deba 
D; 
(b) ifbvcEE,thenbvcEDebEDorcED; 
(c) if K,bE D, then bE D, B,bE D and B,K,bE 
D; 
(d) if K,B,bE 
E and B,bE D, then K,B;bE 
D; 
(e) if B,K,b E D, then K,b E D; 
(f) 
if Xb E D, then 93b E D, K,YCb E D and Kib E D; 
(g) if %b E D, then B&3336 
E D and Bib E D. 
The sets in which all beliefs 
are true are of special 
interest. 
Definition 
2.9. F c r is a normal 
set if it satisfies: 
if B,b E F, then b E F. 
We now define two binary 
relations 
between 
subsets 
of r 
Definition 
2.10. Let D, and D, be subsets 
of r We say that D, -; D2 iff 
(a) D2 is normal; 
(b) for all bET, 
BibE D,eB,bE 
D2. 

Knowledge, belief and time 
161 
Definition 
2.11. Let D, and O2 be subsets 
of lY We say that D, ci O2 iff 
(a) for all b E r, B;b E D,@Bib 
E D2; 
(b) for all beT, 
K,bED,@K,bED,. 
Using 
the theorems 
that were mentioned 
before, 
it is easy to prove that if T, G r 
and T,G r are consistent 
and complete 
theories, 
then 
(1) TI and T2 are standard 
sets on r; 
(2) T,~~T,iff 
forall 
bEr,K,bET,jbET,; 
(3) T, -i T, iff for all bET, 
BibE T,-bE 
T2. 
We may prove general 
properties 
about the relations 
-i 
and = ;. 
Lemma 2.12. 
The relations 
=i and -i defined in Dejinitions 
2.10 and 2.11 have the 
following 
properties: 
(a) -i 
is an equivalence 
relation (reflexive, 
transitive 
and symmetric). 
(b) Zf E c r is closed under subformulas, 
and D, and D, are standard 
sets on E, 
then if D, -, D,, 
then D, =;DD2; 
(c) For any D,, D,, D, subsets of r, if D, = i D2 and D, -, D,, 
then D, zi D3. 
Proof. 
(a): Obvious. 
(b): 
Suppose 
there exist D,, 
D, subsets 
of E such that D, -i D2. We have to 
prove 
that D, and D, satisfy 
the conditions 
of Definition 
2.11. Condition 
(a) is 
obvious 
by condition 
(b) of the definition 
of -;. 
For condition 
(b) K,b E D, iff 
BiKjb E DI since D, is a standard 
set, B,K,b E D, iff B,K,b E Dz since D, -i D,, and 
B,K,b E D2 iff K,b E D, since D, is a standard 
set. 
(c): We have to prove 
that for any D, , D2, D, subsets 
of r if D, si Dz and 
Dz-;D,, 
then D, -i D3. D, is normal 
because 
D2 -i D3. Bib E D, ti Bib E D2 since 
D, Ei D,. But if B,b E D,, then Bib E D, since D2 -i D,. 
0 
We want to remark 
that the restrictions 
of =, and -, 
on a subset of r keep the 
properties 
of Lemma 
2.12. 
Lemma 2.13. Let D, and D, be subsets of r. If E g r is closed under subformulas, 
then 
(a) D,=;D2 
iflD,nE 
=,D,nE; 
(b) D, -i D, $TD,nE 
-,D,nE. 
Proof. 
Obvious. 
0 
We shall now define an iteration 
process 
of elimination 
on the standard 
sets on 
A(a). 
The main goal of this process 
is to reach a situation 
in which we are left with 
a group 
of traces which can be used in constructing 
a universal 
model.

Definition 2.14. For all 2 2 0 we define a set W, of standard 
sets on A (a): W,, is the 
set of the standard 
sets on A(a). 
For 12 0, let W ,+, consists 
of all those 
D’s E W, 
that satisfy 
(1) there exists a D, E W, such that D -, D, ; 
(2) for I&b E A(a) 
if Kib G D, then there exists a D, E W, such that D si D, and 
b&D,; 
(3) for Bib E A(a) 
if Bib& D, then there exists a D, E W, such that D -, D, and 
be D,; 
(4) for Ytb E A (a) if Xb & D, then there exists a k 2 0 and for all 0 <j G k there 
exists a D,EW, 
such that D=D,, 
D,-g,Dj+, 
forj=O,...,k-l,g,EPeople 
and 
bE Dk; 
(5) for 93b E A (a) if 93b & D, then there exists a k 2 0 and for all 0 <j s k there 
existsaD,EW,suchthatD=D,, 
D,-,,D,+,forj=O,...,k-l,gj~People,and 
b&D,. 
Clearly, 
from the finiteness 
of W0 there is some i0 where this construction 
closes 
up, i.e., for every j> 
iO, Wj = Wk. Accordingly, 
we set W = Wh. The main 
results 
concerning 
W are the following: 
Lemma 2.15. For any D c A (a) if there exists some consistent and complete theory T 
such that D= TnA(u), 
then DE W. 
Proof. We show, by induction 
on k, that such a set is in “ur, for every k. 
Basis step (k = 0): It is obvious 
from the axiomatic 
system 
and the theorems 
above and by [ 12, Lemma 
I] that any such D G A(u) 
is a standard 
set. 
Induction 
step (k > 0): We have to prove that any DE “ur,_, such that there exists 
some consistent 
and complete

(1): Let

We shall prove that the theory 
F is consistent.

So F is a consistent 
theory 
and it may be 
completed 
by [12, Lemma

to a consistent

T’. Let 
D, zdef T’n A(a). 
By the induction

D, E ‘lVk_, . We shall now show that 
D-,

of Definition

First if Bib E 0, then, 
by the definition 
of F, B,b E F and Bib E T’ and B,b E D, 
because 
Bib E A (a). Suppose, 
on the contrary, 
that B,b G D; we have to distinguish 
between 
two different 
cases: If Bib @ A (a), then B,b G D, . But if Bib E A (a) - 0, then 
lB,b 
E D (lB,b 
E A(u) 
and D is standard 
set) and iBib 
E F (by the definition 
of 
F) and iBib 
E D,. 
It remains 
to be shown that D, is normal, 
i.e., satisfies the condition 
of Definition 
2.9. Suppose

K,b E T, a 
contradiction. 
(3): Similar 
to the proof of (2) and simpler. 
(4): Suppose 
that .7Cb E A(a) 
and Xb & D. We may define 
and we have to prove that there exists an F’ E 9 such that b EZ F. If G is a subset 
of r, we define the characteristic 
formula 
of G by xG =def AOEG a. The characteristic 
formula 
XG is not in general 
in G, but it is easy to prove that for any consistent 
and 
complete 
theory 
T, G = T n A( a)e,yc 
E T. We may define 
+!I =def VFp9 xF. 
Notice 
that for any consistent 
and complete 
theory 
T, T n A(a) E 9e 
$ E T. We 
have to prove that C$ + jji K& Suppose 
not. Then there is a consistent 
and complete 
theory 
S such that Ic, E S and A\iKilC, .@ S. It follows that there exists aj E People such 
that K,I,!J E S; therefore 
there exists a consistent 
and complete 
theory 
S’ and S =j S’ 
and 
4 @ S’. We may conclude 
that S’n A(a) $9. 
But S zj S’ and therefore 
S n 
A(a) 
EjS’nA(u) 
by Lemma 
2.13, and SnA(u)E9 
and we may conclude 
that 
S’ n A (a) E 9. A contradiction.(*) 
So, from F$ + /ji K,$ it follows 
that t-X[+ 
+ /ji Ki$] by (Rl), 
and by using the 
induction 
rule (A7) we may conclude 
that +tJ + XI,!J. But txD + 4 because 
DE 9; 
therefore 
txD + XI+!J. 
Now we may finish the proof that there exists an F’E 9 such that b & F. Suppose 
that VF E 9, b E F. It follows 
that t$ + b; then 
tX$ 
+ Xb and t-,yD + Xb; 
but 
x0 E T and then Ytb E T and we may conclude 
that Xb E D, contradiction. 
(5): Suppose 
that 9336 E A (a) and Bb @ D. The beginning 
of the proof 
is similar 
to the proof of the previous 
case till (*) by replacing 
= i by -i, 
X by 93 and K, by 
Bi. So, from EI,/+A~ 
Bi$ it follows 
that FCB[+-A~ 
Bi$] by (Rl) 
and (A16), and 
by using the induction 
rule (A13) we may conclude 
that t/ji 
B,$ + 93$. 
We have 
to prove 
that 
+xD + B& 
Suppose 
not. 
Then 
B,$E T since 
xD E T. 
Therefore 
there exists a consistent 
and complete 
theory 
T’ and T -i T’ and $ & T’. 
We may conclude 
that T’ n A (a ) @ 9. But T -i T’ and therefore 
T n A (U ) - i T’ n 
A(u) 
by Lemma 
2.13, and TnA(u)c9 
and we may conclude 
that T’nA(u)EB, 
a contradiction. 
So, FX~+ 
/ji Bi$ and k/j;

F-_x[,+ a+,

the proof as in the previous

Proof of Theorem 
2.6. (continued). 
The completeness 
proof 
now proceeds 
in the 
following 
way: suppose 
that bLa; we shall build 
a model 
that does not satisfy 
a. 
First, by [ 12, Lemma 
1 (e)] there is a consistent 
and complete 
theory 
T, that contains 
la. 
From 
Lemma 
2.15, 
D, = T, nA(a) 
is 
in 
W. 
The 
model 
A = 
(S, s, 1, =,, -2,. 
. . ) = n, -,, 
-*, . . .) - ,,) that does not satisfy 
a is defined 
in the 
following 
way: 
(1) s= 
w, 
(2) s=D,, 
(3) ~(D)={PIPED), 
(4) zi and -i 
are defined 
as in Definitions 
2.10 and 2.11. 
Our main result concerning 
the model 
A is the following 
lemma. 
Lemma2.17. 
LetbEA(a) 
andsEW; 
thenblf,=trueGbbS. 
Proof. 
The proof is by induction 
on the structure 
of b. 
Case b =p: 
pi”, = true CJ p E l(s) by the definition 
of the model. 
Case b = lc: 
lc E se 
c@ s (since 
s is a standard 
set) e 
CITY, 
= false 
by the 
induction 
hypothesis. 
Caseb=cvd:cvdEs~cCsordEs(sincesisastandardset)~cl,~~,=trueor 
d 1% = true by the induction 
hypothesis. 
Case b = Kit: 
Kit E s+K,c 
E t for all 1 E W such that s -< t by the definition 
of 
Ei JC E t since 
t is standard 
*cl,‘, 
= true by the induction 
hypothesis. 
Suppose 
now that K,c& s. Since 
K,CE A(a) 
it follows 
by condition 
2 of Lemma 
2.16 that 

166 
S. Kraus. D. Lehmann 
there exists a t E 22’ such that s = i t and b E t and we may conclude 
by the induction 
hypothesis 
that bl!, = false. 
Case b = BiC: B;c E s+Bic 
E t for all t E W such that s -i t by the definition 
of 
-i 3 c E t since t is a normal 
set *cl 
.>( = true by the induction 
hypothesis. 
The other 
direction 
is like the previous 
case by condition 
(3) of Lemma 
2.16. 
Case b = Xc: Suppose 
YCc E s. We have to prove that, for any g z 0 and for any 
sO~ sI,. . .Y sj,--. 7 sg7 if sjE ?@“, j=O ,..., 
g; s=sg, 
sj

g-1, 
k, E People, 
then 
c E ss. Xc E sj; therefore, 
K,,%c E sj since 
3 is standard; 
then 
XCESj,,. 
But XCES,; 
therefore 
XCE su and 
c E s, since 
sp is standard. 
By the 
induction 
hypothesis 
we may conclude 
that cl”; = true. The opposite 
direction 
is 
similar 
to the previous 
case by condition 
(5) of Lemma 
2.16. 
Case b = Bc: Similar 
to the previous 
case.

Proof of Theorem 2.6 (conclusion). 
So we can finish the proof of the completeness 
by concluding 
that .&#a. 
q 
3. Time 
We may now extend 
our logic to capture 
time by adding 
new modal 
operators 
to the language. 
The new operators 
are 0 (next), 
0 (always) 
and Until (until). 
We think 
that when talking 
about 
how beliefs 
are changing 
in time, one must 
distinguish 
between 
at least two different 
notions 
of belief. 
First, belief 
can mean 
readiness 
to bet. 
“Person 
i believes 
that 
this 
afternoon 
it will 
rain” 
means, 
operationally, 
that he will take his raincoat 
with him in the morning. 
If it does not 
rain, no problem, 
he will be slightly 
inconvenienced 
by having 
to take his raincoat 
back and forth. But a second 
acceptation 
is possible, 
in which belief is a much more 
serious 
matter. 
One cannot 
allow 
reality 
to contradict 
one’s beliefs 
because 
that 
would 
be too traumatic 
an experience. 
Therefore 
one may believe 
only things that 
may not, ever, under any circumstances, 
be shown to be false. One may not believe 
that it will rain because 
he could 
come to know that his belief was erroneous 
and 
he does not want to take that chance. 
One may believe 
things that one knows to be 
true 
or things 
that cannot 
be proven 
false. 
For example, 
one may believe 
the 
Continuum 
Hypothesis 
(or its negation) 
since its negation 
is not a theorem 
of set 
theory. 
This meaning 
of belief 
is perhaps 
close to the meaning 
of religious 
belief. 
So, talking 
about 
this last meaning 
of belief 
(the “serious” 
meaning), 
if person 
i 
believes 
that something 
will be true tomorrow, 
it must be that he knows that he will 
not discover 
tomorrow 
that 
it is wrong. 
Therefore 
the following 
axiom 
seems 
reasonable 
for this second 
interpretation: 
(A17) 
B,Oa 
+ K,OlK,la 
for any iE People. 

Knowledge, belief and time 
167 
Now, if person 
i believes that tomorrow 
a will be true, since he cannot find tomorrow 
that he is wrong, 
he has all the reasons 
to persist 
in his beliefs 
and we may accept 
(Al8) 
B,Oa 
+ OB,a 
for any in People. 
If (A18) is accepted, 
one can also accept 
(A19) 
!33Oa -+ 0%~. 
Now one may notice 
that (A17) is provable 
from (A18) and forget (A17). Fagin 
and Halpern 
in [2] argue that (A18) “is moving 
us away from our goal of capturing 
realistic 
notions 
of belief”. 
Indeed, 
in everyday 
life, the verb “believe” 
is probably 
used with a meaning 
of the type “readiness 
to bet”. A logical, nonnumeric, 
convincing 
treatment 
of such a notion 
is problematic. 
In such an interpretation 
of belief, (the “weak” 
meaning) 
axioms (A18) and (A19) 
do not seem reasonable. 
Somebody 
may believe 
(in the “weak” 
meaning) 
that it 
will rain tomorrow, 
but tomorrow 
he will not believe so. Nevertheless, 
if one believes 
that tomorrow 
a is true, one believes 
(today) 
that tomorrow 
one will continue 
to 
believe 
a. Therefore 
we propose 
the axiom 
(for the first interpretation): 
(A20) 
B,Ou 
+ B,OB,u 
for any in People. 
This axiom says nothing 
about the future and we need some more expressive 
axiom 
to capture 
what happens 
to our beliefs 
in time. No one likes to change 
his beliefs, 
and one shall change 
them only if one is forced to do so. For example, 
somebody 
who drove to his office in the morning 
and left his car in the parking 
lot believes 
that his car is in the parking 
lot and in good mechanical 
condition. 
He will continue 
to believe it unless a friend of his calls him to tell him that his car has been damaged 
by another 
car or has been 
stolen. 
Then 
he stops believing 
that his car is in the 
parking 
lot, and he knows 
the opposite. 
We want to say that if person 
i believes 
something, 
he will keep on believing 
it until he knows it is false. The way to say so 
is: 
(A21) 
B,Ou 
+ OB,u v OK,lu 
for any i E People. 
The following 
is provable 
from A21, but weaker: 
(A22) 
BiOu 
+ OB,u 
v OB,lu 
for any i c People. 
The meaning 
of this axiom is that one stops believing 
in something 
when one believes 
it is false. For example, 
does the driver (from the previous 
example) 
know that his 
car was damaged?! 
He did not see his car, and maybe 
his friend 
was joking?! 
An open 
problem 
is: find a natural 
family 
of models 
for which 
the systems 
considered 
above are complete. 
The ways by which common 
knowledge 
and common 
belief may be achieved 
in 
a distributed 
environment 
are fundamentally 
different. 
Halpern 
and 
Moses 
[6] 
proved that, in order for common 
knowledge 
to be attainable 
in a system, the system 
must be capable 
of simultaneity. 
This limitation 
is a direct 
consequence 
of the 

168 
S. Kraus, D. Lehmann 
following 
theorem: 
Yta *K,.XL 
for all i E People. 
On the contrary, 
the formula: 
B,!Z’u + 6%~ is not valid. 
Note that %3a ++ .%%a is valid. Therefore 
it could be that 
q 
B,%3a and OUB,%u 
and OOClB,% 
. . . and at instant 
n (n = IPeople]) 
?F%u will 
be true and will be common 
belief. 
We just described 
a system in which common 
belief is gained 
and which is not capable 
of simultaneity. 
Similarly, 
in a system in 
which, at first, a is common 
belief, but later on, agent i stops believing 
a is common 
belief, 
common 
belief 
is lost, without 
any simultaneity 
being 
necessary. 
We may 
conclude 
that common 
belief seems a more realistic 
notion than common 
knowledge, 
which can be attainable 
without 
simultaneity. 
4. The puzzle of the wise men 
As an example 
of the possible 
use of the logic of belief, common 
belief and time 
(without 
knowledge), 
we provide 
a new analysis 
of the puzzle that was analysed 
in 
[9]. We use the system that includes 
a suitable 
axiomatization 
of the temporal 
logic 
of linear 
time (see [4]), the axioms 
(A8)-(A13) 
and (A19), the rules of inference 
(RO) and a common 
belief generalization 
rule: if tu, 
then t!%‘u. 
We think that axiom (A19) seems very reasonable 
since common 
belief is a strong 
notion. 
Therefore, 
if it is common 
belief 
that tomorrow 
a will be true, 
it seems 
reasonable 
that tomorrow 
a will be common 
belief. 
The puzzle could be told the following 
way. Once upon a time, the happy chairman 
of the Computer 
Science 
Department 
at Utopia 
University 
was told by the President 
that the good financial 
situation 
of the university 
allowed 
for some pay increases 
in his department. 
The chairman 
decided 
to distribute 
the pay increases 
among 
his 
three professors 
in a way that would provide 
for both fun and justice. 
He asked all 
three professors 
to a room and showed 
them five hats: two white hats and three 
black hats. He told them: 
at exactly 
12:00 noon 
I will turn off the light and place 
a hat on each of your three heads; 
you are not allowed 
to put those hats off your 
head; 
I will destroy 
the two remaining 
hats and will not know myself which of the 
hats have been 
destroyed; 
then 
I will leave the room and switch the light on; at 
1:00 p.m. I will come back and ask whether 
somebody 
can tell the colour 
of his 
hat; a wrong 
answer 
means 
unemployment, 
a correct 
answer 
means 
a large pay 
increase; 
if one (at least) 
of you speaks 
at 1:00 p.m., then the game is finished; 
if 
nobody 
speaks 
at that time, then I will come back at 2:00 p.m. and ask the same 
question 
but offer only a smaller 
pay increase 
to anybody 
who can tell the colour 
of his hat; this will go on at each hour (for decreasing 
financial 
rewards) 
until one 
of you speaks up. The chairman 
did as he said, left the room and switched 
the light 
on. As soon as he sat down 
in his office a telephone 
call from his wife asked him 
in no uncertain 
terms to be home at 2:30 p.m. to greet her parents. 
He agreed. The 
question 
is: how did the chairman 
know he could leave the university 
in time, i.e., 
that he would 
not have to be back for the 3:00 p.m. visit to his staff? 

Knowledge, belief and time 
169 
It should 
be pointed 
out that the chairman 
cannot 
indeed 
exclude 
a possible 
cooperation 
between 
his professors 
but he cannot 
either count on such a cooperation, 
things 
being 
as they are. 
Of interest 
to us in this puzzle are both the kind of reasoning 
used by the professors 
and the chairman, 
and the exact list of all assumptions 
hidden 
in this puzzle. 
The 
notion 
of common 
belief will prove itself useful in both respects. 
We think that this 
analysis 
of the puzzle is sharper 
and more realistic 
than the analysis 
using common 
knowledge 
that was provided 
in [9], and 
we may compare 
them 
later. 
For the 
description 
of the, sometimes 
hidden, 
assumptions 
and the participants’ 
reasoning 
we shall use the following 
basic propositions 
(propositional 
variables). 
To minimize 
propositional 
variables, 
we build 
some of the assumptions 
in the interpretation 
of 
those variables. 
It would not be difficult to state exactly those assumptions 
by using 
some more variables. 
The professors 
will be numbered 
1, 2, 3. The instants 
of time 
considered 
are 12:00 noon, 
1:00 p.m., 2:00 p.m. and so on. We use the propositional 
variable 
b, to mean “professor 
i has, now, a black hat on his head”, 
and wi to mean 
“professor 
i has, now, 
a white 
hat on his head”. 
For 
i = 1,. . . ,3 we use the 
propositional 
variable 
d, to mean “professor 
i declares, 
now, the colour of his hat”. 
We shall also use the following 
notations: 
def 
def 
a , = 
V 
bi, 
a2 = (b, v bd A (b, v bd A (b, v b,), 
,=I,. .,3 
def 
a s= 
A 
h. 
i; I,...,3 
the formula 
uk means 
“there 
are at least k black hats”. 
We now proceed 
to describe 
the assumptions 
of the puzzle. 
Assumption 
1 is that 
it is common 
belief that one has either a black hat or a white hat. 
(CBWB) 
%‘Cl(lbit, 
wi) 
for i = 1,. . . ,3. 
This assumption 
is weaker than the corresponding 
hidden 
assumption 
in [9]. In [9] 
the assumptions 
that lb, 
is equivalent 
to wi is built in the description 
of the puzzle 
and therefore 
it is common 
knowledge 
that hats are either 
black 
or white; 
here 
however 
it is only common 
belief. Therefore 
one of the hats could be yellow. 
Assumption 
2 is that it is common 
belief that hats do not change 
colours 
and do 
not move from one head to another. 
(CBHI) 
Bi7(b,-Obi)A 
.?ZO(w,-Ow,) 
for i=l, 
. . .,3. 
The similar 
assumption 
(HI) 
from [9] is much stronger 
than this one. In (CBHI) 
the professors 
believe that the hats do not change 
colours 
and do not move from 
one head to another 
and that everyone 
believes 
that hats do not change 
colours 
and 
so on, but they do not know it and it could 
also be that it is not true. 

170 
S. Kraus, D. Lehmann 
Assumption 
3 is that it is common 
belief 
that no professor 
is blind, 
i.e. every 
professor 
believes 
he sees the color of the hat of each of his colleagues. 
It does not 
mean 
that one of the professors 
could not be color blind 
and maybe 
he does not 
know the real color of the hats, but he believes 
that he sees the right color and this 
fact is common 
belief. 
(CBNB) 
~U(bj~Bibj)A~O(Wj~BiWj) 
for i=l,..., 
3, j=l,..., 
3, i#j. 
Assumption 
4 expresses 
that a professor 
declares 
the colour 
of his hat to be white 
only when 
he believes 
the colour 
of his hat is white 
(respectively 
black); 
on the 
other hand, he will declare 
as soon as he can after he has come to believe 
the colour 
of his hat to be white 
(respectively 
black). 
To simplify 
matters 
a little bit and to 
avoid 
introducing 
the Until connective 
in our formulas, 
we assume 
that once 
a 
professor 
declares 
the colour 
of his hat, he goes on declaring 
it at every subsequent 
instant 
(hour). 
(CBSR) 
?7J17(B,bi v B,w,oOd,) 
for i = 1,. . . ,3 
This axiom is not weaker than (SR) from [9]. Here a professor 
does not wait until 
he knows the colour 
of his hat, as in (SR), but in our version 
this is only common 
belief 
and not common 
knowledge. 
Assumption 
5 expresses 
that the fact for a participant 
to speak 
up, or, more 
important, 
to stay quiet, is public 
enough 
to create common 
belief. In other words, 
whether 
a professor 
speaks 
up or not is immediately 
common 
belief. 
(ND1)O(~3dit,di)~Cl(~ld,t,ld,) 
for i=1,...,3. 
(NDl) 
is the only axiom that considers 
the reality. 
All the others assumed 
certain 
common 
beliefs. 
Our last assumption 
(assumption 
6) is that it is common 
belief that, at 12:00 noon, 
there is at least one professor 
donning 
a black hat: 
(CBTWH)%, 
. 
Our claim about the puzzle is that if nobody 
speaks up at 1:00 p.m. or at 2:00 p.m., 
then every single professor 
will speak up at 3:00 p.m. In particular, 
the chairman 
knows that a final decision 
will, at the latest, be made at 2:Ol p.m. formally, 
we claim

We want to remark that we do not prove anything 
about how the professors 
acquire 
their beliefs, 
and when the professors 
will not speak. Even in the case all the three 
professors 
have black 
hats ((-u,), we prove that at least one of the professors 
will 
speak till 3:00, but we are not able to prove, 
using 
our system, 
that no one will 
speak before 
this time. It could be that one of them will start believing 
the colour 
of his hat white (respectively 
black) 
before 
2:00, by e.s.p. for example. 
Building 
a 

Knowledge, 
belief and time 
171 
logical system which puts genera1 sensible 
restriction 
on the way one acquires 
beliefs 
is an open problem. 
The proof 
is done 
in three main 
parts. 
First we prove that it is common 
belief 
that at 1:00 p.m. if it is common 
belief that no one speaks 
up, then it is common 
belief that there are at least two black hats. In the second 
part we prove that it is 
common 
belief that at 1:00 p. m. if it is common 
belief that there are at least two 
black hats, then if at 2:00 p.m. it is common 
belief that no one speaks up, then at 
2:00 it will be common 
belief that at 3:00 p.m everybody 
will speak up. In the parts 
of the proof described 
above we use only the assumptions 
that begin with common 
belief ((CBHI), 
(CBSR), 
(CBTWH), 
(CBNB), 
(CBWB)) 
and not assumption 
(NDl) 
that considers 
reality. 
We use this last axiom only in the third part when we prove 
our final claim by putting 
our results from the previous 
parts together. 
The main stages of the proof will be described.
