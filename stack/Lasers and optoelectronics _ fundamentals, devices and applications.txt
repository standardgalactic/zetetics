Preface
Laser, an acronym for light ampliﬁcation by stimulated emission of radiation (as coined by Gould in his
notebooks) is a household name today. In their early stages of development and evolution, lasers were
originally conﬁned to the premises of prominent research centres such as the Bell laboratories and
Hughes research laboratories and to major academic institutes such as Columbia University. More than
ﬁve decades after Theodore Maiman demonstrated the ﬁrst laser in May 1960 at Hughes, this is no longer
the case. Lasers are undoubtedly one of the greatest inventions of the 20th century along with satellites,
computers and integrated circuits. Their use in commercial, industrial, bio-medical, scientiﬁc and
military applications continues to expand today.
Lasers and Optoelectronics: Fundamentals, Devices and Applications is a comprehensive treatise on
the physical and engineering principles of laser operation, laser system design, optoelectronics and laser
applications. It provides a ﬁrst complete account of the technological and application-related aspects of
the subject of lasers and optoelectronics. The book is divided into four parts: laser fundamentals; types of
lasers; laser electronics and optoelectronics; and laser applications.
The ﬁrst chapter of Part I (Laser Fundamentals) aims to introduce the readers to the operational
fundamentals of lasers with the necessary dose of quantum mechanics. The topics discussed in
Chapter 1 include the principles of laser operation; concepts of population inversion, absorption,
spontaneous emission and stimulated emission; three-level and four-level lasers; basic laser resona-
tor; longitudinal and transverse modes of operation; and pumping mechanisms. Chapter 2 discusses
the special characteristics that distinguish laser radiation from ordinary light. This is followed by a
discussion of the various laser parameters that interest the designers and users of laser devices and
systems.
Chapters 3–5 (Part II) describe the three main types of lasers. Based on the nature of the lasing medium,
lasers are classiﬁed as either solid-state lasers (Chapter 3), gas lasers (Chapter 4) and semiconductor lasers
(Chapter 5). Chapter 3 is focused on the operational fundamentals of solid-state lasers, their salient features
and typical applications. Gas lasers covered in Chapter 4 include helium-neon lasers, carbon dioxide lasers,
metal vapour lasers, rare gas ion lasers, excimer lasers, chemical lasers and gas dynamic carbon dioxide
lasers.Again,the emphasis isonoperationalfundamentals,salientfeaturesandtypicalapplications ofthese
lasers. (Dye lasers, free electron lasers and x-ray lasers are also covered in Chapter 4, although these do not
belong to any of the three main categories.) Chapter 5 discusses semiconductor diode lasers, which
typically emit in the visible to near-infrared bands of the electromagnetic spectrum. Optically pumped
semiconductor lasers, quantum cascade lasers, lead salt lasers and antimonide lasers are also covered
brieﬂy. Topics covered in this chapter include operational fundamentals, semiconductor materials used in
the fabrication of semiconductor lasers, different types of semiconductor diode lasers, characteristic
parameters, handling precautions and application areas.
Part III (Chapters 7–10) provides information on the electronics that accompany most laser systems.
Chapter 6 describes the basic building blocks of electronics generally used in the design of electronics
packages of prominent laser sources and systems conﬁgured around them. The intention is to familiarize
the readers with the operational basics of these building blocks, allowing an understanding of the speciﬁc
laser electronics packages discussed in the following chapters. This chapter will particularly beneﬁt laser

and optoelectronics students and professionals who do not have a comprehensive knowledge of
electronics.
Chapters 7–9 describe the electronics that feature in the three major categories of lasers. Chapter 7
deals with the design and the operational aspects of different types of power supplies, pulse repetition
rate and high-voltage trigger generation circuits used in pulsed and continuous wave solid-state lasers.
Chapter 8 describes the fundamentals of gas laser power supplies in terms of requirement speciﬁcations,
circuit conﬁgurations and design guidelines, with particular reference to the two most commonly used
gas lasers (helium-neon and carbon dioxide lasers). Power supply conﬁgurations for metal vapour lasers
and excimer lasers (and to a large extent noble gas ion lasers) are similar to those used for helium-neon
and carbon dioxide lasers except for minor deviations, which are discussed during the course of the text.
Frequency stabilization techniques used in the case of helium-neon and carbon dioxide lasers are also
discussed. Chapter 9 discusses the different topics related to semiconductor diode laser electronics. The
chapter describes the common mechanisms of laser damage and the precautions which must be observed
to protect them. The different topologies commonly used in the design of laser diode drive circuits and
temperature controllers to meet the requirements of different applications are also described. Chapter 10
provides detailed information on the fundamentals and application circuits of different types of
optoelectronic devices.
Part IV (Chapters 11–15) comprehensively covers applications of lasers and optoelectronic devices.
Chapters 11, 12 and 13 cover industrial, medical and scientiﬁc applications respectively, and Chapters 14
and 15 cover military applications. The major industrial applications of lasers discussed in Chapter 11
includes cutting, welding, drilling, marking, rapid prototyping, photolithography and laser printing. The
use of lasers in medical disciplines such as angioplasty, cancer diagnosis and treatment, dermatology,
ophthalmology, cosmetic applications such as hair and tattoo removal and dentistry are discussed in
Chapter 12. Chapter 13 describes some of the important applications of lasers in the pursuit of science
and technology. Topics discussed include the use of lasers for optical metrology, laser velocimetry, laser
vibrometry, electron speckle pattern interferometry, Earth and environmental studies, astronomy and
holography. The use of lasers and optoelectronic devices in defence are exhaustively covered in Chapters
14 and 15.
The book is concluded with an appendix including a brief discussion on laser safety, which is of
paramount importance to a wide cross-section of designers and users of laser systems.
The book covers each of the topics in its entirety from basic fundamentals to advanced concepts,
thereby leading the reader logically from the basics of laser action to advanced topics in laser system
design. Simple explanations of the concepts, a number of solved examples and unsolved problems and
references for further reading are signiﬁcant features of each chapter.
The motivation to write this book was provided by the absence of any one volume combining the
technology and application-related aspects of laser and optoelectronics. The book is aimed at a wide
range of readers, including: undergraduate students of physics and electronics, graduate students
specializing in lasers and optoelectronics, scientists and engineers engaged in research and development
of lasers and optoelectronics; and practising professionals engaged in the operation and maintenance of
lasers and optoelectronics systems.

1.1
Introduction
Although lasers were conﬁned to the premises of prominent research centres such as the Bell
laboratories, Hughes research laboratories and major academic institutes such as Columbia University
in their early stages of development and evolution, this is no longer the case. Theodore Maiman
demonstrated the ﬁrst laser ﬁve decades ago in May 1960 at Hughes research laboratories. The acronym
‘laser’, Light Ampliﬁcation by Stimulated Emission of Radiation, ﬁrst used by Gould in his notebooks is
a household name today. It was undoubtedly one of the greatest inventions of the second half of the 20th
century along with satellites, computers and integrated circuits; its unlimited application potential
ensures that it continues to be so even today. Although lasers and laser technology are generally applied
in commercial, industrial, bio-medical, scientiﬁc and military applications, the areas of its usage are
multiplying as are the range of applications in each of these categories.
This chapter, the ﬁrst in Laser basics, is aimed at introducing the readers to operational fundamentals
of lasers with the necessary dose of quantum mechanics. The topics discussed in this chapter include: the
principles of laser operation; concepts of population inversion, absorption, spontaneous emission and
stimulated emission; three-level and four-level lasers; basic laser resonator; longitudinal and transverse
modes of operation; and pumping mechanisms.
1.2
Laser Operation
The basic principle of operation of a laser device is evident from the deﬁnition of the acronym ‘laser’,
which describes the production of light by the stimulated emission of radiation. In the case of ordinary
light, such as that from the sun or an electric bulb, different photons are emitted spontaneously due to
various atoms or molecules releasing their excess energy unprompted. In the case of stimulated emission,
an atom or a molecule holding excess energy is stimulated by a previously emitted photon to release that
energy in the form of a photon. As we shall see in the following sections, population inversion is an
essential condition for the stimulated emission process to take place. To understand how the process of
population inversion subsequently leads to stimulated emission and laser action, a brief summary of
quantum mechanics and optically allowed transitions is useful as background information.
1.3
Rules of Quantum Mechanics
According to the basic rules of quantum mechanics all particles, big or small, have discrete energy levels
or states. Various discrete energy levels correspond to different periodic motions of its constituent nuclei
and electrons. While the lowest allowed energy level is also referred to as the ground state, all other
relatively higher-energy levels are called excited states. As a simple illustration, consider a hydrogen

atom. Its nucleus has a single proton and there is one electron orbiting the nucleus; this single electron
can occupy only certain speciﬁc orbits. These orbits are assigned a quantum number N with the
innermost orbit assigned the number N ¼ 1 and the subsequent higher orbits assigned the numbers N ¼ 2,
3, 4 . . . outwards. The energy associated with the innermost orbit is the lowest and therefore N ¼ 1 also
corresponds to the ground state. Figure 1.1 illustrates the case of a hydrogen atom and the corresponding
possible energy levels.
The discrete energy levels that exist in any form of matter are not necessarily only those corresponding
to the periodic motion of electrons. There are many types of energy levels other than the simple-to-
describe electronic levels. The nuclei of different atoms constituting the matter themselves have their
own energy levels. Molecules have energy levels depending upon vibrations of different atoms within the
molecule, and molecules also have energy levels corresponding to the rotation of the molecules. When
we study different types of lasers, we shall see that all kinds of energy levels – electronic, vibrational and
rotational – are instrumental in producing laser action in some of the very common types of lasers.
Transitions between electronic energy levels of relevance to laser action correspond to the wavelength
range from ultraviolet to near-infrared. Lasing action in neodymium lasers (1064 nm) and argon-ion
lasers (488 nm) are some examples. Transitions between vibrational energy levels of atoms correspond to
infrared wavelengths. The carbon dioxide laser (10 600 nm) and hydrogen ﬂuoride laser (2700 nm)
are some examples. Transitions between rotational energy levels correspond to a wavelength range from
100 microns (mm) to 10 mm.
In a dense medium such as a solid, liquid or high-pressure gas, atoms and molecules are constantly
colliding with each other thus causing atoms and molecules to jump from one energy level to another.
What is of interest to a laser scientist however is an optically allowed transition. An optically allowed
transition between two energy levels is one that involves either absorption or emission of a photon which
satisﬁes the resonance condition of DE ¼ hn, where DE is the difference in energy between the two
involved energy levels, h is Planck’s constant (¼ 6.626 075 5  1034 J s or 4.135 669 2  1015 eV s)
and n is frequency of the photon emitted or absorbed.
1.4
Absorption, Spontaneous Emission and Stimulated Emission
Absorption and emission processes in an optically allowed transition are brieﬂy mentioned in the
previous section. An electron or an atom or a molecule makes a transition from a lower energy level to a
higher energy level only if suitable conditions exist. These conditions include:
1. the particle that has to make the transition should be in the lower energy level; and
2. the incident photon should have energy (¼ hn) equal to the transition energy, which is the difference
in energies between the two involved energy levels, that is, DE ¼ hn.
If the above conditions are satisﬁed, the particle may make an absorption transition from the lower
level to the higher level (Figure 1.2a). The probability of occurrence of such a transition is proportional to
both the population of the lower level and also the related Einstein coefﬁcient.
There are two types of emission processes, namely: spontaneous emission and stimulated emission.
The emission process, as outlined above, involves transition from a higher excited energy level to a
lower energy level. Spontaneous emission is the phenomenon in which an atom or molecule
undergoes a transition from an excited higher-energy level to a lower level without any outside
intervention or stimulation, emitting a resonance photon in the process (Figure 1.2b). The rate of the
spontaneous emission process is proportional to the related Einstein coefﬁcient. In the case of
stimulated emission (Figure 1.2c), there ﬁrst exists a photon referred to as the stimulating photon
which has energy equal to the resonance energy (hn). This photon perturbs another excited species
(atom or molecule) and causes it to drop to the lower energy level, emitting a photon of the same
frequency, phase and polarization as that of the stimulating photon in the process. The rate of the
stimulated emission process is proportional to the population of the higher excited energy level and
the related Einstein coefﬁcient. Note that, in the case of spontaneous emission, the rate of the emission

process does not depend upon the population of the energy state from where the transition has to
take place, as is the case in absorption and stimulated emission processes. According to the rules
of quantum mechanics, absorption and stimulated emission are analogous processes and can be
treated similarly.
We have seen that absorption, spontaneous emission and stimulated emission are all optically
allowed transitions. Stimulated emission is the basis for photon multiplication and the fundamental
mechanism underlying all laser action. In order to arrive at the necessary and favourable conditions
for stimulated emission and set the criteria for laser action, it is therefore important to analyze the
rates at which these processes are likely to occur. The credit for deﬁning the relative rates of these
processes goes to Einstein, who determined the well-known ‘A’ and ‘B’ constants known as Einstein’s
coefﬁcients. The ‘A’ coefﬁcient relates to the spontaneous emission probability and the ‘B’ coefﬁcient
relates to the probability of stimulated emission and absorption. Remember that absorption and
stimulated emission processes are analogous phenomenon. The rates of absorption and stimulated
emission processes also depend upon the populations of the lower and upper energy levels,
respectively.
For the purposes of illustration, consider a two-level system with a lower energy level 1 and an
upper excited energy level 2 having populations of N1 and N2, respectively, as shown in Figure 1.3a.
Einstein’s coefﬁcients for the three processes are B12 (absorption), A21 (spontaneous emission) and
B21 (stimulated emission). The subscripts of the Einstein coefﬁcients here represent the direction of
transition. For instance, B12 is the Einstein coefﬁcient for transition from level 1 to level 2. Also,
since absorption and stimulated emission processes are analogous according to laws of quantum
mechanics, B12 ¼ B21. According to Boltzmann statistical thermodynamics, under normal conditions
of thermal equilibrium atoms and molecules tend to be at their lowest possible energy level, with the
result that population decreases as the energy level increases. If E1 and E2 are the energy levels

emission.

associated with level 1 and level 2, respectively, then the populations of these two levels can be
expressed by Equation 1.1:

Under normal conditions, N1 is greater than N2. When a resonance photon (DE ¼ hn) passes through
the species of this two-level system, it may interact with a particle in level 1 and become absorbed, in the
process raising it to level 2. The probability of occurrence of this is given by B12  N1 (Figure 1.3b).
Alternatively, it may interact with a particle already in level 2, leading to emission of a photon with the
same frequency, phase and polarization. The probability of occurrence of this process, known as
stimulated emission, is given by B21  N2 (Figure 1.3d). Yet another possibility is that a particle in the
excited level 2 may drop to level 1 without any outside intervention, emitting a photon in the process. The
probability of this spontaneous emission is A21 (Figure 1.3c). The spontaneously emitted photons have
the same frequency but have random phase, propagation direction and polarization.
If we analyze the competition between the three processes, it is clear that if N2 > N1 (which is not the
case under the normal conditions of thermal equilibrium), there is the possibility of an overall photon
ampliﬁcation due to enhanced stimulated emission. This condition of N2 > N1 is known as population
inversion since N1 > N2 under normal conditions. We shall explain in the following sections why
population inversion is essential for a sustained stimulated emission and hence laser action.
Example 1.1
Refer to Figure 1.4. It shows the energy level diagram of a typical neodymium laser. If this laser is to
be pumped by ﬂash lamp with emission spectral bands of 475–525 nm, 575–625 nm, 750–800 nm and
820–850 nm, determine the range of emission wavelengths that would be absorbed by the active medium
of this laser and also the wavelength of the laser emission.

1. Referring to the energy level diagram of Figure 1.4, two edges of the absorption band correspond to
energy levels of 12 500 cm1 and 13 330 cm1. Corresponding wavelengths (of photons) that would
have these energy levels are computed as:
Wavelength corresponding to 12 500 cm1 ¼ (1/12 500) cm ¼ (107/12 500) nm ¼ 800 nm
Wavelength corresponding to 13330cm1¼ (1/13 330) cm¼ (107/13330) nm¼ 750.19nm ﬃ750nm

2. The absorption band of the active medium is therefore 750–800 nm. This is the band of wavelengths
that would be absorbed by the active medium.
3. Lasing action takes place between metastable energy level 11 935 cm1 and the lower energy level
2500 cm1. The difference between two energy levels is 11 9352500 cm1 ¼ 9435 cm1.
4. This energy corresponds to a wavelength of (1/9435) cm ¼ (107/9435) nm ¼ 1059.88 nm ﬃ1060 nm.
5. The emitted laser wavelength is therefore ¼ 1060 nm.
Example 1.2
Figure 1.5 shows the energy level diagram of a popular type of a gas laser. Determine the possible
emission wavelengths.
Solution
1. The emission wavelength is such that the corresponding energy value equals the energy difference
between the involved lasing levels.
2. For emission 1, the energy difference (from Figure 1.5) ¼ 0.117 eV.
If l1 is the emission wavelength, then hc/l1 ¼ 0.117 where
h ¼ Planck’s constant ¼ 6.626 075 5  1034 J s ¼ 4.135 669 2  1015 eV s
c ¼ 3  1010 cm s1
Substituting these values, l1 ¼ (4.135 669 2  1015  3  1010)/0.117 cm ¼ 106.04  105 cm
¼ 10 604 nm.

3. For emission 2, the energy difference (from Figure 1.5) ¼ 0.129 eV
If l1 is the emission wavelength, then hc/l1 ¼ 0.129. Substituting these values, l1 ¼ (4.1 356
692  1015  3  1010)/0.129 cm ¼ 96.178  105 cm ¼ 9617.8 nm.
4. The energy level diagram shown in Figure 1.5 is that of carbon dioxide laser, which is also evident
from the results obtained for the two emission wavelengths.
Example 1.3
We know that absorption and emission between two involved energy levels takes place when the photon
energy corresponding to the absorbed or emitted wavelength equals the energy difference between the
two energy levels. If DE is energy difference in eV, prove that the absorbed or emitted wavelength (in
nm) approximately equals (1240/DE).
Solution
1. Emitted or absorbed wavelength l ¼ hc/DE
2. In the above expression, if we substitute the value of h in eV s, c in nm s1 and DE in eV, we obtain l
in nm.
3. Now, h ¼ 4.135 669 2  1015 eV s and c ¼ 3  108 m s1 ¼ 3  1017 nms1
Therefore, l (in nm) ¼ 4.135 669 2  1015  3  1017/DE ﬃ1240/DE.
1.5
Population Inversion
We shall illustrate the concept of population inversion with the help of the same two-level system
considered above. If we compute the desired transition energy for an optically allowed transition, let us
say at a wavelength of 1064 nm corresponding to the output wavelength of a neodymium-doped yttrium
aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) laser, it turns out to be about 1 eV (transition energy DE ¼ hn). For a
transition energy of 1 eV, we can now determine the population N2 of level 2, which is the upper excited
level here, for a known population N1 of the lower level at room temperature of 300 K from Equation 1.1.
The ﬁnal relationship is N2 ¼ 1:5  1017N1.
This implies that practically all atoms or molecules are in the lower level under thermodynamic
equilibrium conditions. Let us not go that far and instead consider a situation where the population of the
lower level is only ten times that of the excited upper level. We shall now examinewhat happens when there
is a spontaneously emitted photon. Now there are two possibilities: either this photon stimulates another
excited species in the upper level to cause emission of another photon of identical character, or it would hit
an atom or molecule in the lower level and be absorbed. Since there are 10 atoms or molecules in the lower
level for every excited species in the upper level, we can say that 10 out of every 11 spontaneously emitted
photons hit the atoms or molecules in the lower level and become absorbed. Only 9% (1 out of every 11) of
the photons cancausestimulated emission.The photons emitted by the stimulated process willalso become
absorbed successively due to the scarcity of excited species in the upper level. Another way of expressing
this is that when the population of the lower level is much larger than the population of the excited upper
level, the probability of each spontaneously emitted photon hitting an atom or molecule in the lower level
and becoming absorbed is also much higher than the same stimulating another excited atom or molecule in
the upper level. The same concept underlies the expressions for the probability of absorption, spontaneous
emission and stimulated emission previously outlined in Section 1.4:
Probability of absorption ¼ B12  N1
Probability of spontaneous emission ¼ A12
Probability of stimulated emission ¼ B21  N2
If we want the stimulated emission to dominate over absorption and spontaneous emission, we must
have a greater number of excited species in the upper level than the population of the lower level. Such
a situation is known as population inversion since under normal circumstances the population of the
lower level is much greater than the population of the upper level. Population inversion is therefore an
10
Lasers and Optoelectronics

essential condition for laser action. The next obvious question is that of the desired extent of
population inversion. Spontaneous emission depletes the excited upper level population (N2 in the
present case) at a rate proportional to A21 producing undesired photons with random phase, direction
of propagation and polarization. Due to this loss and other losses associated with laser cavity
(discussed in Section 1.7), each laser has a certain minimum value of N2N1 for the production of laser
output. This condition of population inversion is known as the inversion threshold of the laser. Lasing
threshold is an analogous term.
Next, we shall discuss how we can produce population inversion.
1.5.1
Producing Population Inversion
That population inversion is an essential condition for laser action is demonstrated above. Population
inversion ensures that there are more emitters than absorbers with the result that stimulated emission
dominates over spontaneous emission and absorption processes. There are two possible ways to produce
population inversion. One is to populate the upper level by exciting extra atoms or molecules to the upper
level. The other is to depopulate the lower laser level involved in the laser action. In fact, for a sustained
laser action, it is important to both populate the upper level and depopulate the lower level.
Two commonly used pumping or excitation mechanisms include optical pumping and electrical
pumping. Both electrons and photons have been successfully used to create population inversion in
different laser media. While optical pumping is ideally suited to solid-state lasers such as ruby, Nd:YAG
and neodymium-doped glass (Nd:Glass) lasers, electrical discharge is the common mode of excitation in
gas lasers such as helium-neon and carbon dioxide lasers.
The excitation input, optical or electrical, usually raises the atoms or molecules to a level higher than
the upper laser level from where it rapidly drops to the upper laser level. In some cases, the excitation
input excites atoms other than the active species. The excited atoms then transfer their energy to the
active species to cause population inversion. A helium-neon laser is a typical example of this kind where
the excitation input gives its energy to helium atoms, which subsequently transfer the energy to neon
atoms to raise them to the upper laser level.
The other important concept essential for laser action is the existence of a metastable state as the
upper laser level. For stimulated emission, the excited state needs to have a relatively longer lifetime of
the order of a few microseconds to a millisecond or so. The excited species need to stay in the excited
upper laser level for a longer time in order to allow interaction between photons and excited species,
which is necessary for efﬁcient stimulated emission. If the upper laser level had a lifetime of a few
nanoseconds, most of the excited species would drop to the lower level as spontaneous emission. The
crux is that, for efﬁcient laser action, the population build-up of the upper laser level should be faster than
its decay. A longer upper laser level lifetime helps to achieve this situation.
1.6
Two-, Three- and Four-Level Laser Systems
Another important feature that has a bearing on the laser action is the energy level structure of the laser
medium. As we shall see in the following sections, energy level structure, particularly the energy levels
involved in the population inversion process and the laser action, signiﬁcantly affect the performance of
the laser.
1.6.1
Two-Level Laser System
In a two-level laser system, there are only two levels involved in the total process. The atoms or
molecules in the lower level, which is also the lower level of the laser transition, are excited to the upper
level by the pumping or excitation mechanism. The upper level is also the upper laser level. Once the
population inversion is achieved and its extent is above the inversion threshold, the laser action can take
place. Figure 1.6 shows the arrangement of energy levels in a two-level system. A two-level system is,
however, a theoretical concept only as far as lasers are concerned. No laser has ever been made to work as
a two-level system.
Laser Basics
11

1.6.2
Three-Level Laser System
In a three-level laser system, the lower level of laser transition is the ground state (the lowermost
energy level). The atoms or molecules are excited to an upper level higher than the upper level of the
laser transition (Figure 1.7). The upper level to which atoms or molecules are excited from the ground
state has a relatively much shorter lifetime than that of the upper laser level, which is a metastable
level. As a result, the excited species rapidly drop to the metastable level. A relatively much longer
lifetime for the metastable level ensures a population inversion between the metastable level and the
ground state provided that more than half of the atoms or molecules in the ground state have been
excited to the uppermost short-lived energy level. The laser action occurs between the metastable
level and the ground state.
A ruby laser is a classical example of a three-level laser. Figure 1.8 shows the energy level structure for
this laser. One of the major shortcomings of this laser and other three-level lasers is due to the lower laser
level being the ground state. Under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, almost all atoms or
molecules are in the ground state and so it requires more than half of this number to be excited out
of the ground state to achieve laser action. This implies that a much larger pumping input would be
required to exceed population inversion threshold. This makes it very difﬁcult to sustain population
inversion on a continuous basis in three-level lasers. That is why a ruby laser cannot be operated in
continuous-wave (CW) mode.
Figure 1.7
Three-level laser system.
Figure 1.6
Two-level laser system.
12
Lasers and Optoelectronics

An ideal situation would be if the lower laser level were not the ground state so that it had much fewer
atoms or molecules in the thermodynamic equilibrium condition, solving the problem encountered in
three-level laser systems. Such a desirable situation is possible in four-level laser systems in which the
lower laser level is above the ground state, as shown in Figure 1.9.
Figure 1.8
Energy level diagram of ruby laser.
Figure 1.9
Four-level laser system.
Laser Basics
13

1.6.3
Four-Level Laser System
In a four-level laser system, the atoms or molecules are excited out of the ground state to an upper highly
excited short-lived energy level. Remember that the lower laser level here is not the ground state. In this
case, the number of atoms or molecules required to be excited to the upper level would depend upon the
population of the lower laser level, which is much smaller than the population of the ground state. Also if
the upper level to which the atoms or molecules are initially excited and the lower laser level have a
shorter lifetime and the upper laser level (metastable level) a longer lifetime, it would be much easier to
achieve and sustain population inversion. This is achievable due to two major features of a four-level
laser. One is rapid population of the upper laser level, which is a result of an extremely rapid dropping of
the excited species from the upper excited level where they ﬁnd themselves with excitation input to the
upper laser level accompanied by the longer lifetime of the upper laser level. The second occurrence is
the depopulation of the lower laser level due to its shorter lifetime. Once it is simpler to sustain
population inversion, it becomes easier to operate the laser in the continuous-wave (CW) mode. This is
one of the major reasons that a four-level laser such as an Nd:YAG laser or a helium-neon laser can be
operated in the continuous mode while a three-level laser such as a ruby laser can only be operated as a
pulsed laser.
Nd:YAG, helium-neon and carbon dioxide lasers are some of the very popular lasers with a four-level
energy structure. Figure 1.10 shows the energy level structure of a Nd:YAG laser. The pumping or
excitation input raises the atoms or molecules to the uppermost energy level, which in fact is not a single
level but instead a band of energy levels. This is a highly desirable feature, the reason for which is
discussed more fully in Section 1.11 on pumping mechanisms. The excited species rapidly fall to the
upper laser level (metastable level). This decay time is about 100 ns. The metastable level has a
Figure 1.10
Energy level diagram of Nd:YAG laser.
14
Lasers and Optoelectronics

metastable lifetime of about 1 ms and the lower laser level has a decay time of 30 ns. If we compare the
four-level energy level structure of a Nd:YAG laser with that of a neodymium-doped yttrium lithium
ﬂuoride (Nd:YLF) laser, another solid-state laser with a four-level structure, we ﬁnd that there is a
striking difference in the lifetime of the metastable level. Nd:YLF has a higher metastable lifetime
(typically a few milliseconds) as compared to 1 ms of Nd:YAG. This gives the former a higher storage
capacity for the excited species in the metastable level. In other words, this means that a Nd:YLF rod
could be pumped harder to extract more laser energy than a Nd:YAG rod of the same size.
1.6.4
Energy Level Structures of Practical Lasers
In the case of real lasers, the active media do not have the simple three- or four-level energy level
structures as described above, but are far more complex. For instance, the short-lived uppermost
energy level, to which the atoms or molecules are excited out of the ground state and from where they
drop rapidly to the metastable level, is not a single energy level. It is in fact a band of energy levels, a
desirable feature as it makes the pumping more efﬁcient and a larger part of the pumping input is
converted into a useful output to produce population inversion. The energy levels involved in
producing laser output are not necessarily single levels in all lasers. There could be multiple levels in
the metastable state, in the lower energy state of the laser transition or in both states. This means that
the laser has the ability to produce stimulated emission at more than one wavelength. Helium-neon
and carbon dioxide lasers are typical examples of this phenomenon. Figure 1.11 shows the energy
level structure of a helium-neon laser.
Another important point worth mentioning here is that it is not always the active species alone that
constitute the laser medium or laser material. Atoms or molecules of other elements are sometimes added
with speciﬁc objectives. In some cases, such as in a helium-neon laser, the active species producing laser
transition is the neon atoms. Free electrons in the discharge plasma produced as a result of electrical
pumping input excite the helium atoms ﬁrst as that can be done very efﬁciently. When the excited helium
atoms collide with neon atoms, they transfer their energy to them. As another example, in a carbon
dioxide laser the laser gas mixture mainly consists of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and helium. While

nitrogen participates in the excitation process and plays the same role as that played by helium in a
helium-neon laser, the helium in a carbon dioxide laser helps in depopulating the lower laser level.
1.7
Gain of Laser Medium
When we talk about the gain of the laser medium we are basically referring to the extent to which this
medium can produce stimulated emission. The gain of the medium is deﬁned more appropriately as a
gain coefﬁcient, which is the gain expressed as a percentage per unit length of the active medium. When
we say that the gain of a certain laser medium is 10% per centimetre, it implies that 100 photons with the
same transition energy as that of an excited laser medium become 110 photons after travelling 1 cm of the
medium length. The ampliﬁcation or the photon multiplication offered by the medium is expressed as a
function of the gain of the medium and the length of the medium, as described in Equation 1.2:
GA ¼ eax
(1.2)
where
GA ¼ ampliﬁer gain or ampliﬁcation factor
a
¼ gain coefﬁcient
x
¼ gain length
The above expression for gain can be re-written in the form:
GA ¼ ea
ð
Þx ¼ 1 þ a
ð
Þx
for a  1
(1.3)
Therefore, to a reasonably good approximation, we can write
Amplification factor ¼ ð1 þ gain coefficientÞlength of medium
This implies that when the medium with a gain coefﬁcient of 100% is excited and population inversion
created, a single spontaneously emitted photon will become two photons after this spontaneously emitted
photon travels 1 cm of the length of the medium. The two photons cause further stimulated emission as
they travel through the medium. This ampliﬁcation continues and the number of photons emitted by the
stimulation process keeps building up just as the principal amount builds up with compound interest. The
above relationship can be used to compute the ampliﬁcation. It would be interesting to note how photons
multiply themselves as a function of length. For instance, although 10 photons become 11 photons after
travelling 1 cm for a gain coefﬁcient of 10% per centimetre, the number reaches about 26 for 10 cm and
1173 after travelling gain length of 50 cm, as long as there are enough excited species in the metastable
state to ensure that stimulated emission dominates over absorption and spontaneous emission. On the
other hand it is also true that, for a given pump input, there is a certain quantum of excited species in the
upper laser level. As the stimulated emission initially triggered by one spontaneously emitted photon
picks up, the upper laser level is successively depleted of the desired excited species and the population
inversion is adversely affected. This leads to a reduction in the growth of stimulated emission and
eventually saturation sets in; this is referred to as gain saturation.
Another aspect that we need to look into is whether the typical gain coefﬁcient values that the majority
of the active media used in lasers have are really good enough for building practical systems. Let us do a
small calculation. If a 5 mW CW helium-neon laser were to operate for just 1 s, it would mean an
equivalent energy of 5 mJ. Each photon of He-Ne laser output at 632.8 nm would have energy of
approximately 3  1019 J, which further implies that the above laser output would necessitate
generation of about 1.7  1016 photons. With the kind of gain coefﬁcient which the helium-neon laser
plasma has, the required gain length can be calculated for the purpose. For any useful laser output, the
solution therefore lies in having a very large effective gain length, if not a physically large gain length.
If we enclose the laser medium within a closed path bounded by two mirrors, as shown in
Figure 1.12, we can effectively increase the interaction length of the active medium by making the
16
Lasers and Optoelectronics

photons emitted by stimulated emission process back and forth. One of the mirrors in the arrangement
is fully reﬂecting and the other has a small amount of transmission. This small transmission, which
also constitutes the useful laser output, adds to the loss component. This is true because the fraction of
the stimulated emission of photons taken as the useful laser output is no longer available for
interaction with the excited species in the upper laser level. The maximum power that can be coupled
out of the system obviously must not exceed the total amount of losses within the closed path. For
instance, if the gain of the full length of the active medium is 5% and the other losses such as those due
to absorption in the active medium, spontaneous emission, losses in the fully reﬂecting mirror (which
will not have an ideal reﬂectance of 100%) and so on are 3%, the other mirror can have at the most a
transmission of 2%.
In a closed system like this, the power inside the system is going to be much larger than the power
available as useful output. For instance, for 1% transmission and assuming other losses to be negligible,
if the output power is 1 mW the power inside the system would be 100 mW.
Example 1.4

ampliﬁcation by a factor of 1.1.

1.8
Laser Resonator
The active laser medium within the closed path bounded by two mirrors as shown in Figure 1.12
constitutes the basic laser resonator provided it meets certain conditions. Resonator structures of most
practical laser sources would normally be more complex than the simplistic arrangement of Figure 1.12.
As stated in the previous section, with the help of mirrors we can effectively increase the interaction
length of the active medium by making the photons emitted by the stimulated emission process travel
back and forth within the length of the cavity. One of the mirrors in the arrangement is fully reﬂecting and
the other has a small amount of transmission. It is clear that if we want the photons emitted as a result of
the stimulated emission process to continue to add to the strength of those responsible for their emission,
it is necessary for the stimulating and stimulated photons to be in phase. The addition of mirrors should
not disturb this condition. For example, if the wave associated with a given photon was at its positive
peak at the time of reﬂection from the fully reﬂecting mirror, it should again be at its positive peak only
after it makes a round trip of the cavity and returns to the fully reﬂecting mirror again. If this happens,
then all those photons stimulated by this photon would also satisfy this condition. This is possible if we

satisfy the condition given in Equation 1.4:
Round trip length ¼ 2L ¼ nl
(1.4)
where
L ¼ length of the resonator
l ¼ wavelength
n ¼ an integer
The above expression can be rewritten as
f ¼ nc
2L
(1.5)
where
c ¼ velocity of electromagnetic wave
f ¼ frequency
1.9
Longitudinal and Transverse Modes
The above expression for frequency indicates that there could be a large number of frequencies for
different values of the integer n satisfying this resonance condition. Most laser transitions have gain for a
wide range of wavelengths. Remember that we are not referring to lasers that can possibly emit at more
than one wavelength (such as a helium-neon laser). Here, we are referring to the gain-bandwidth of one
particular transition. We shall discuss in detail in Chapter 4 how gas lasers such as He-Ne and CO2 lasers
have Doppler-broadened gain curves. A He-Ne laser has a bandwidth of about 1400 MHz for 632.8 nm
transition (Figure 1.13a) and a CO2 laser has a bandwidth of about 60 MHz at 10 600 nm (Figure 1.13b).
It is therefore possible to have more than one resonant frequency, each of them called a longitudinal
mode, simultaneously present unless special measures are taken to prevent this from happening. As is
clear from Equation 1.5, the inter-mode spacing is given by c/2L. For a He-Ne laser with a cavity length
of 30 cm for example, inter-mode spacing would be 500 MHz which may allow three longitudinal modes
to be simultaneously present as shown in Figure 1.14a. Interestingly, the cavity length could be reduced
Figure 1.13
Gain-bandwidth curves for He-Ne and CO2 lasers.
18
Lasers and Optoelectronics

to a point where the inter-mode spacing exceeds the gain-bandwidth of the laser transition to allow only a
single longitudinal mode to prevail in the cavity. For instance, a 10 cm cavity length leading to an inter-
mode spacing of 1500 MHz would allow only a single longitudinal mode (Figure 1.14b). However, there
are other important criteria that also decide the cavity length.
Another laser parameter that we are interested in and that is also largely inﬂuenced by the design of the
laser resonator is the transverse mode structure of the laser output. We have already seen in the previous
sections how the resonator length and the laser wavelength together decide the possible resonant
frequencies called longitudinal modes, which can simultaneously exist. The transverse modes basically
tell us about the irradiance distribution of the laser output in the plane perpendicular to the direction of
propagation or, in other words, along the orthogonal axes perpendicular to the laser axis. To illustrate this
further, if the z axis is the laser axis, then intensity distribution along the x and y axes would describe the
transverse mode structure.
TEMmn describes the transverse mode structure, where m and n are integers indicating the order of the
mode. In fact, integers m and n are the number of intensity minima or nodes in the spatial intensity
pattern along the two orthogonal axes. Conventionally, m represents the electric ﬁeld component and n
indicates the magnetic ﬁeld component. Those who are familiar with electromagnetic theory should not
ﬁnd this difﬁcult at all to grasp. Remember that transverse modes must satisfy the boundary conditions
such as having zero amplitude on the boundaries. The simplest mode, also known as the fundamental or
the lowest order mode, is referred to as TEM00 mode. The two subscripts here indicate that there are no
minima along the two orthogonal axes between the boundaries. The intensity pattern in both the
orthogonal directions has a single maximum with the intensity falling on both sides according to the
well-known mathematical distribution referred to as the Gaussian distribution. The Gaussian distribution
(Figure 1.15) is given by Equation 1.6:
I rð Þ ¼ I0 exp 2r2=w2


(1.6)
where
I(r) ¼ intensity at a distance r from the centre of the beam
w
¼ beam radius at (1/e2) of peak intensity point, which is about 13.5% of the peak intensity
Figure 1.14
Longitudinal modes.

We also have
I0 ¼ 2P
pw2
(1.7)
where
P ¼ total power in the beam
Before we discuss the deﬁnite advantages that the operation at lowest order or fundamental modes
TEM00 offers, we shall have quick look at higher-order modes and also how different transverse mode
appear in relation to their intensity distributions. Figure 1.16 shows the spatial intensity distribution of
the laser spot for various transverse mode structures of the laser resonator.
Going back to the fundamental mode, we can appreciate that this mode has the least power spreading.
To add to this, this mode has the least divergence; it has the minimum diffraction loss and therefore can
be focused onto the smallest possible spot. The transverse mode structure is also critically dependent
upon parameters such as laser medium gain, type of laser resonator and so on. There are established
resonator design techniques to ensure operation at the fundamental mode. Often, lasers optimized to
produce maximum power output operate at one or more higher-order modes. Also, lasers with low gain
and stable resonator conﬁguration can conveniently be made to operate at fundamental mode. Details are
beyond the scope of this book, however.
Example 1.5
Given that the Doppler-broadened gain curve of a helium-neon laser with a 50-cm-long resonator
emitting at 1.15 mm is 770 MHz, determine (a) inter-longitudinal mode spacing and (b) the number of
maximum possible sustainable longitudinal modes.
Solution: Resonator length L ¼ 50 cm. Therefore, inter-longitudinal mode spacing ¼ c/2L ¼ 3 
1010/100 ¼ 300 MHz.

Width of Doppler-broadened gain curve ¼ 770 MHz. The number of longitudinal modes possible within
this width ¼ 3 (Figure 1.17).
1.10
Types of Laser Resonators
According to the type of end mirrors used and the inter-element separation, which largely dictates the
extent of interaction between the emitted photons and the laser medium and also the immunity of the
laser resonator to misalignment of end components, the resonators can be broadly classiﬁed as stable and
unstable resonators. A stable resonator is one in which the photons can bounce back and forth between
the end components indeﬁnitely without being lost out the sides of the components. Due to the focusing
nature of one or both components, the light ﬂux remains within the cavity in such a resonator. A plane-
parallel resonator (Figure 1.18) in which both end components are plane mirrors and are placed
precisely at right angles to the laser axis is a stable resonator. In practice, however, this is not true. A
slight misalignment of even one of the mirrors would ultimately lead to light ﬂux escaping the laser
cavity after several reﬂections from the two mirrors. Nevertheless, such a resonator encompasses a large
volume of the active medium. It is not used in practice, as it is highly prone to misalignment.

This problem can be overcome by using one plane and one curved mirror, as is the case for
hemispherical and hemifocal resonators shown in Figure 1.19a and b, respectively, or two curved
mirrors, as is the case for concentric and confocal resonators shown in Figure 1.20a and b, respectively.
Although the problem of sensitivity of the plane-parallel resonator to misalignment of cavity mirrors is
largely overcome by the use of different stable resonator conﬁgurations discussed above (Figures 1.19
and 1.20), not all of them have emitted photons interacting with a large volume of the excited species,
which is also equally desirable. It is also true that in the case of low-gain media with consequent very low
transmission output mirrors, the photons travel back and forth a large number of times within the cavity
before their energy appears at the output. This makes the resonator alignment more critical. That is why a
plane-parallel resonator will never be the choice for a low-gain laser medium.
On the other hand, in a high-gain medium a certain amount of light ﬂux leakage can be tolerated. This
fact is made use of in an unstable resonator conﬁguration, which otherwise achieves interaction of the
emitted photons with a very large volume of the excited species. Figure 1.21 shows one possible type of
unstable resonator. Note that photons escape from the sides of the mirror after one or two passes within
the cavity. This light leakage, which also constitutes the useful laser output, is more than compensated
for by a high-gain medium and large interaction volume. Further, since the photons have to make

relatively fewer passes within the cavity as compared to a low-gain stable resonator conﬁguration before
drifting out, the alignment becomes much less critical.

Pumping Mechanisms
By pumping mechanism, we mean the mechanism employed to create population inversion of the lasing
species. Commonly employed pumping mechanisms include:
1. optical pumping;
2. electrical pumping; and
3. other mechanisms such as pumping by chemical reactions, electron beams and so on.
One aspect that is common to all pumping mechanisms is that the pumping energy/power must be
greater than the laser output energy/power. When applied to optical pumping, it is obvious that the
optical pump wavelength must be smaller than the laser output wavelength. This has to be true as the

lasing species are ﬁrst excited to the topmost level from where they drop to the upper laser level. Since
the energy difference between the ground state and the topmost pump level is always greater than the
energy difference between the two laser levels, the wavelength of the pump photon must be less than
the wavelength of the laser output. Another aspect that is common to all schemes is that pumping
efﬁciency largely affects the overall laser efﬁciency. For instance, if the energy difference for the
pump transition is much greater than that of the laser transition, the laser efﬁciency is bound to be
relatively poorer. An argon-ion laser is a typical example. Yet another aspect that is common to all
pumping mechanisms is that the topmost pump level is not a single energy level but rather a band of
closely spaced energy levels with allowed transitions to a single and, in some cases, more than one
metastable level. When applied to optical pumping, this allows the use of optical sources such as ﬂash
lamps with broadband outputs.
1.11.1
Optical Pumping
Optical pumping is employed for those lasers that have a transparent active medium. Solid-state and
liquid-dye lasers are typical examples. The most commonly used pump sources are the ﬂash lamp in the
case of pulsed and the arc lamp in the case of continuous-wave solid-state lasers.
Flash lamps are pulsed sources of light and are widely used for the pumping of pulsed solid-state
lasers. These are available in a wide range of arc lengths (from a few centimetres to as large as more
than a metre, although arc length of 5–10 cm is common), bore diameter (typically in the range of
3–20 mm), wall thickness (typically 1–2 mm) and shape (linear, helical). Figures 1.22 and 1.23
depict the constructional features of typical linear (Figure 1.22) and helical (Figure 1.23)
ﬂash lamps.
Flash lamps for pumping solid-state lasers are usually ﬁlled with a noble gas such as xenon or krypton
at a pressure of 300–400 torr. Two electrodes are sealed in the envelope that is usually made of quartz. An
electrical discharge created between the electrodes leads to a very high value of pulsed current, which
further produces an intense ﬂash. The electrical energy to be discharged through the lamp is stored in an
energy storage capacitor/capacitor bank.
Xenon-ﬁlled lamps produce higher radiative output for a given electrical input as compared to
krypton-ﬁlled lamps. Krypton however offers a better spectral match, more so with Nd:YAG. That is, the
emission spectrum of a krypton ﬂash lamp is better matched to the absorption spectrum of Nd:YAG.
Emission spectra in the case of xenon- and krypton-ﬁlled lamps are depicted by Figures 1.24 and 1.25,
respectively. The absorption spectrum of a Nd:YAG laser is given in Figure 1.26.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Major electrical parameters include the ﬂash lamp impedance parameter, maximum average power,
maximum peak current, minimum trigger voltage and explosion energy. Impedance characteristics of a
ﬂash lamp are extremely important as they determine the energy transfer efﬁciency from energy storage
capacitor, where it is stored, to the ﬂash lamp.
Table 1.1 gives typical values of various characteristic parameters of xenon-ﬁlled and krypton-ﬁlled
pulsed ﬂash lamps from Heraeus Noblelight Ltd. The type numbers chosen for the purpose include both
air-cooled as well as liquid-cooled ﬂash lamps of different bore diameter and arc length. This assortment
of ﬂash lamps highlights the variation of the electrical parameters with bore diameter and arc length for a

given category of ﬂash lamps, and also the range of values for bore diameter and arc length with the
different categories of ﬂash lamps.
Arc lamps are used for CW pumping of solid-state lasers. Like ﬂash lamps, arc lamps are also gas-
discharge devices. Arc lamps suitable for solid-state laser pumping are linear lamps (Figure 1.27),
which are very much like linear ﬂash lamps except for electrode design. As evident from Figure 1.27,
arc lamps use pointed cathodes rather than the rounded cathodes used in ﬂash lamps. Arc lamps are
ﬁlled with xenon or krypton at a pressure of 1–3 atmospheres. Krypton-ﬁlled linear arc lamps are
more common because of their relatively better spectral match to the Nd:YAG absorption band. Bore
diameters of 4–7 mm and arc lengths in the range of 50–150 mm are common.
Table 1.2 provides typical values for various characteristic parameters in the case of linear
krypton-ﬁlled arc lamps for different values of bore diameter and arc length. The information
given in the table is based on the technical data of linear krypton-ﬁlled arc lamps from EG&G
Electro-optics.
However, the efﬁciency with which pump output is usefully transferred to excite the lasing species is
deﬁnitely lower in the case of the broadband optical pumping provided by ﬂash lamps and arc lamps.
Optical pumping at a single wavelength in a laser with an absorption level corresponding to that
wavelength in the pump band achieves a relatively higher pumping efﬁciency, which leads to higher
overall laser efﬁciency. Optical pumping of solid-state lasers by semiconductor lasers in what are better
known as diode-pumped solid-state lasers achieves an efﬁciency that is 25–30 times that currently
achievable in the case of ﬂash lamp pumped solid-state lasers.
Laser diode arrays for solid-state laser pumping are available in various package conﬁgurations. The
basic element in these arrays, also called stacks, is the laser diode bar (Figure 1.28). Each bar has
multiple emitters. Laser bars are available in both conduction-cooled as well as liquid-cooled varieties.
State-of-the-art bars offer up to 100 W of CW power. Stacks of these bars are also available for higher

pump power requirement (Figure 1.29). However, the maximum pump power available from diode laser
arrays is still much lower than that possible from ﬂash lamps.
1.11.2
Electrical Pumping
Pumping by electrical discharge is common in gas lasers. The excited electrons in the gas-discharge
plasma transfer their energy to the lasing species either directly or indirectly through the atoms

Lasers and Optoelectronics

or molecules of another element. A helium-neon laser is a typical example of an indirect transfer
of pump energy. The electrons ﬁrst transfer the energy to helium atoms and then the excited
helium atoms transfer the energy to neon atoms. A high voltage initially ionizes the gas and, once
the discharge is struck, it can be sustained by a relatively much lower voltage and current. In
a typical He-Ne laser, initiating voltage is of the order 8–10 kV while the sustaining voltage is
around 1.5–2 kV.
Diode lasers are also electrically pumped, but not in the same way as gas lasers. In the case of
diode lasers, the electrical current in the forward-biased diode frees electrons to create electron-
hole pairs. The electrons and holes recombine to emit photons. In doing so, electrons drop back to
the lower state.
1.11.3
Other Methods of Pumping
Some of the other methods of pumping or creating population inversion, which are speciﬁc to certain
types of lasers, include excitation by combustion reaction as in gas dynamic CO2 lasers, chemical
reaction as in chemical lasers such as hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) laser, deuterium ﬂuoride (DF) laser and
chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) and electron acceleration as in free electron lasers. In the case of a
gas dynamic laser for example, a combustion reaction produces a high-temperature high-pressure
mixture of CO2 and other gases required in a CO2 laser. This gas mixture is then rapidly expanded
through a set of nozzles to a very low-pressure low-temperature condition. Although the temperature and
pressure drop rapidly a large number of molecules still remain in the excited state, thus creating
population inversion.

Summary
 Lasers were undoubtedly one of the greatest inventions of the second half of 20th century – along with
satellites, computers and integrated circuits – and continue to be so today due to their unlimited
application potential.
 The basic principle of operation of a laser device is based on stimulated emission of radiation. In the
case of ordinary light, such as that from the sun or an electric bulb, different photons are emitted
spontaneously due to various atoms or molecules releasing their excess energy. In the case of
stimulated emission, an atom or a molecule holding excess energy is stimulated by another previously
emitted photon to release that energy in the form of a photon.
 A laser scientist is interested in an optically allowed transition between two energy levels, which
involves either absorption or emission of a photon satisfying the resonance condition of DE ¼ hn
where DE is the difference in energy between the two involved energy levels, h is Planck’s constant
(¼ 6.626 075 5  1034 J s or 4.135 669 2  1015 eV s) and n is the frequency of the photon emitted or
absorbed.
 There are two types of emission processes: spontaneous emission and stimulated emission. The
emission process involves transition from a higher excited energy level to a lower energy level.
Spontaneous emission is the phenomenon in which an atom or molecule undergoes a transition from
an excited higher energy level to a lower level without any outside intervention or stimulation,
emitting a resonance photon in the process.
 Under thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, practically all atoms or molecules are in the lower
level. A condition of population inversion is said to be achieved when the population N2 of a higher
energy level is greater than the population N1 of a lower energy level. Population inversion is an
essential condition for the laser action.
 There are two possible ways to produce population inversion. One is to populate the upper level by
exciting extra atoms or molecules to the upper level. The other is to depopulate the lower laser level
involved in the laser action. In fact, for a sustained laser action, it is important to both populate the
upper level and depopulate the lower level.

 Energy level structure of the laser medium has an important bearing on the laser action and associated
characteristics. All lasers operate as either three-level (e.g. ruby laser) or four-level lasers (e.g. Nd:
YAG, He-Ne, CO2).
 The gain of the medium is deﬁned as gain coefﬁcient, which is the gain expressed as a percentage per
unit length of the active medium. The gain of the laser medium refers to the extent to which this
medium can produce stimulated emission. The ampliﬁcation or the photon multiplication offered by
the medium is expressed as a function of the gain of the medium and the length of the medium by:
Amplification ¼ ð1 þ gainÞLength of medium.
 A resonator is the active laser medium within the closed path bounded by two mirrors, providing
it meets certain conditions. One of the mirrors in the arrangement is fully reﬂecting and the other
has a small amount of transmission. A laser resonator satisﬁes: Round trip length ¼ 2 L ¼ nl
where L, n and l denote length of the resonator, an integer and wavelength, respectively.
 The resonators can be broadly classiﬁed as stable and unstable resonators. A stable resonator is
one in which the photons can bounce back and forth between the end components indeﬁnitely
without being lost out the sides of the components. In an unstable resonator photons escape from
the sides of the mirror after one or two passes within the cavity. An unstable resonator is usually
chosen with laser media that have a very high gain, as alignment in this resonator type is much
less critical.
 It is possible to have more than one resonant frequency (each referred to as a longitudinal mode) to be
simultaneously present unless special measures are taken to prevent this from happening. The inter-
mode spacing is given by c/2L.
 The transverse modes basically tell us about the irradiance distribution of the laser output in the plane
perpendicular to the direction of propagation or, in other words, along the orthogonal axes
perpendicular to the laser axis.
 Commonly employed pumping mechanisms include optical pumping and electrical pumping. Other
pumping mechanisms include by chemical reactions and electron beams.

Laser Characteristics
2.1
Introduction
In the previous chapter were discussed operational fundamentals of lasers with emphasis on the
mechanisms key to laser action. In the present chapter, we shall discuss the special characteristics that
distinguish laser radiation from ordinary light and that have been responsible for the explosive growth in
applications of laser devices since its invention in 1960. This is followed by a discussion of the different
laser parameters that the designers and users of laser devices and systems are interested in. Some possible
methods for measurement of these parameters are presented towards the end of the chapter.
2.2
Laser Characteristics
Laser radiation can be distinguished from the light from conventional sources on the basis of its special
characteristics and the effects it is able to produce because of these characteristics. It is these
characteristics that have led to explosive growth in the usage of laser devices since the invention of
this magic source of light in 1960. These include:
1. monochromaticity
2. coherence, temporal and spatial
3. directionality.
We shall discuss each of these in some detail in the following sections.
2.2.1
Monochromaticity
Monochromaticity refers to the single frequency or wavelength property of the radiation. Laser radiation
is monochromatic and this property has its origin in the stimulated emission process by which laser emits
light. In describing the process of stimulated emission, we stated that the stimulated photon has the same
frequency, phase and polarization as that of the stimulating photon. As we shall see in the following
sections, monochromaticity is one of the essential requirements for the laser radiation to be coherent.
Although not all monochromatic radiation is necessarily coherent, we shall see that coherent radiation is
necessarily monochromatic.
2.2.1.1
Line-broadening Mechanisms
Laser radiation is not perfectly monochromatic. There could be various factors responsible for the spread
in the frequency or wavelength, called its line width. The uncertainty principle causes slight variations in
the wavelength of different photons emitted during the stimulated emission process. This implies that the
Lasers and Optoelectronics: Fundamentals, Devices and Applications, First Edition. Anil K. Maini.
 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published 2013 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

frequency spread in the case of pulsed lasers depends upon the pulse width of radiation. Shorter pulses
would have a larger spread. This also means that CW laser outputs are likely to be more monochromatic
than the pulsed laser outputs.
The interaction of lasing species with other atoms and molecules is another cause of line broadening.
In the case of gas lasers, the dependence of line width on gas pressure is an example of this phenomenon.
Line width is observed to increase with gas pressure. Increased pressure decreases the time interval
between successive collisions, which in turn affects energy transfer. Line broadening due to increased
pressure is known as pressure broadening or collisional broadening.
Yet another factor contributing to the increase in line width is the inherent random motion of atoms
and molecules. The emitted wavelength corresponding to a randomly moving atom or molecule is such
that its Doppler-shifted component matches the nominal transition wavelength. The random motion of
atoms and molecules causes frequency spread. As an example, gas lasers have a Doppler-broadened gain
curve. The frequency spread in the case of a multimode He-Ne laser at 632.8 nm could be as much as
1400 MHz. The same ﬁgure for a CO2 laser at 10 600 nm is 60 MHz.
Another reason for frequency spread could be the simultaneous oscillation of more than one
longitudinal mode within the laser resonator. The spread in the case of a semiconductor laser is
much greater, of the order 6  106 MHz.
Fortunately, we have techniques (some of which are discussed in Section 8.8) which can be used to
stabilize the frequency at one point on the broad gain-bandwidth curve. We have techniques by which we
can ensure that the laser oscillates at a single longitudinal mode.
Table 2.1 lists the line width of some well-known lasers; note that the magnitudes of line width listed in
the table represent natural line width. There are techniques for narrowing the line width. As an example,
an intra-cavity etalon in an Nd:YAG laser could be employed to reduce its line width to less than
0.2 cm1. As another example, frequency-stabilized helium-neon and carbon dioxide lasers have line
widths that are several orders of magnitude narrower than that of unstabilized counterparts.
There are standard techniques and equipment available for precise measurement of wavelength and
line width of laser radiation. Some of the common methods include: optical spectrum analysis based on
diffraction gratings; conversion of frequency variation into intensity variations with the help of an
unbalanced interferometer or a high-ﬁnesse reference cavity; self-heterodyne technique; heterodyne tech-
nique using two independent lasers; and frequency combs. These are brieﬂy described in Section 2.4.5.

It may also be mentioned here that standard beam diagnostic equipment that makes use of the above-
mentioned techniques is available for the purpose of laser beam analysis in terms of wavelength, line width
and modal proﬁle. These include wave meters, optical spectrum analyzers and beam proﬁlers. Some of this
commercially available diagnostic equipment are brieﬂy mentioned in Section 2.5.
2.2.2
Coherence
The property that best distinguishes laser radiation from ordinary light is coherence. Light is said to be
coherent when different photons (or the waves associated with these photons) have the same phase and
this phase relationship is preserved as a function of time (Figure 2.1). That is, this phase relationship is
preserved as the radiation wave front travels with time. There are two types of coherence: temporal
coherence and spatial coherence.
2.2.2.1
Temporal Coherence
Temporal coherence is the preservation of the phase relationship with time, which is generally what is
meant or assumed by the term coherence. Spatial coherence, which is the preservation of phase across
the width of the beam, is discussed in Section 2.2.2.2.
The necessary conditions for temporal coherence are that all photons should be emitted with same
phase and should have the same wavelength. If the starting phase is the same and all have the same
wavelength, the phase will be preserved irrespective of time. Both these conditions are ideally ensured
by the stimulated emission process, but in reality things are never perfect. The reasons for wavelength
spread were explained in Section 2.2.1 (monochromaticity). If all photons originate with the same
Figure 2.1
Coherence.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

phase, temporal coherence would then depend upon the wavelength or frequency spread. Temporal
coherence is measured as coherence length or coherence time. The two are interrelated as given in
Equation 2.1:
Coherence length ¼ c  tc
(2.1)
where
tc ¼ coherence time
c ¼ speed of light
Coherence length can be computed from the known value of wavelength spread from Equation 2.2:
Coherence length ¼ l2
2Dl
(2.2)
The same relationship can be written in terms of frequency spread by substituting l ¼ c=f and Dl ¼
c=f 2


 Df to obtain
Coherence length ¼
c
2Df
(2.3)
A simple calculation tells you that the coherence length for ordinary light may be of the order of a
fraction of a micron. On the other hand, it could be tens of kilometres for an actively frequency-stabilized
CO2 laser. For instance, a multimode He-Ne laser emitting at 632.8 nm with a frequency spread of
1400 MHz would have a coherence length of about 10 cm. The same laser, if frequency stabilized to say
1 MHz, would have a coherence length of 150 m. A CO2 laser actively stabilized to within 10 kHz, which
is possible with some of the techniques, will have a coherence length of 15 km. Ordinary light, that emits
all wavelengths from 400–900 nm, has an expected coherence length of 0.36 mm assuming an average
wavelength of 600 nm.
Interference fringes formed in a Michelson Interferometer are the result of temporal coherence.
Figure 2.2 shows the schematic arrangement in a Michelson interferometer. As can be seen from the
ﬁgure, the interferometer comprises two mirrors, one of these ﬁxed. The laser beam is split into two paths
with the help of a beam splitter. After splitting, one of the beams strikes a ﬁxed mirror while the other
strikes a movable mirror. After being reﬂected from their respective mirrors, the two beams recombine at
the beam splitter to form an interference pattern. A compensator plate of the same thickness and material
as that of the beam splitter is inserted in the path of the ﬁxed mirror to ensure that the light beams in the
two paths encounter the same thickness of glass. It may be mentioned here that, even for the same
physical path length travelled by the two beams, in the absence of a compensator plate the beam moving
towards the movable mirror encounters a travel path through glass that is three times the thickness of the
beam splitter before it recombines with the other beam. On the other hand, the second beam travelling
towards the ﬁxed mirror encounters only one glass thickness before recombination. The addition of the
compensation plate restores parity.
If the two path lengths differ by a whole number (including 0) of wavelengths, there is constructive
interference; in this case, the two beams arrive back at the beam splitter in phase, assuming that the
two beams at the time of splitting were in phase. On the other hand, if the two path lengths differ by a
whole-number-and-a-half wavelengths, there is destructive interference; in this case the beams arrive
at the beam splitter out of phase with each other. In other words, for constructive interference the path
length difference is ml and for destructive interference, path length difference is ð2m þ 1Þ=2
½
l where
m is a positive or negative integer (including 0) and l is the wavelength. An interference pattern is
formed as long as the path length difference remains less than or equal to the coherence length of the
laser radiation.

2.2.2.2
Spatial Coherence
The other type of coherence is spatial coherence, which describes the correlation in phase of different
photons transverse to the direction of travel. It is the area in the plane perpendicular to the direction of
travel over which the radiation preserves the coherence. The spatial coherence depends upon the
transverse mode discrimination property of the laser resonator. Laser radiation operating in the lowest-
order mode (TEM00) will certainly be more spatially coherent than a multimode laser radiation. When a
laser is operating in a single transverse mode, the radiation will be spatially coherent across the diameter
of the beam over reasonable propagation distances. Young’s double slit experiment and formation of
fringes is the best illustration of the phenomenon of spatial coherence.
Figure 2.3 shows the schematic arrangement of Young’s double slit experiment. As shown in
Figure 2.3b, the incident light beam is split into beams. The beam in this case splits up after passing
through two slits that are a distance d apart. The two beams strike a screen at a distance L from the plane
carrying the slits. In the case d is much smaller than length L, the difference in the path lengths r1–r2
travelled by the two beams is approximately equal to d sin u.
Again, if the two beams were in phase when they passed through the slits, which they would be if the
incident beam were spatially coherent, then for constructive interference to occur on the screen
d sin u ¼ ml. For destructive interference, d sin u ¼ ð2m þ 1Þ=2
½
l where m is a positive or negative
integer including zero. For m ¼ 0 and u ¼ 0, we get a bright fringe which is known as central maximum.
On both sides of central maximum, we get bright fringes at angles u equal to sin1 l=d

Temporal and spatial coherence are independent of each other. While monochromaticity leads to
temporal coherence, it is the transverse mode discrimination characteristics of the resonator that
determines the spatial coherence. A given laser may be temporally coherent and spatially incoherent,
or vice versa.

2.2.3
Directionality
The directionality of laser radiation has its origin in the coherence of the stimulated emission process. All
photons emitted as a result of stimulated emission processes have the same frequency, phase, direction and
polarization. When emitted, these photons carry no information regarding the location of the excited atom
or molecule responsible for its emission. It appears as if all photons were emitted from a tiny volume with

dimensions that are of the order of a wavelength. If a photon is emitted off-axis, spatial coherence makes it
appearasifitwereemittedfromtheaxis.Similarly,foraphotonthatisemittedawayfromthebeamwaiston
the same axis, temporal coherence makes it appear as if it were emitted from the beam waist.
Example 2.1
A He-Ne laser emitting at 633 nm has a line width of 0.002 nm. Determine its coherence length. Also
determine the coherence length if the same laser was frequency stabilized to a frequency uncertainty of
100 kHz.
Solution
1. Coherence length ¼ l2
2Dl where l ¼ 633 nm and Dl ¼ 0.002 nm.
2. Coherence length therefore ¼ (633)2/(2  0.002) nm ¼ 108 nm ¼ 10 cm.
3. Coherence length can also be computed from
c
2Df where Df ¼ 100 kHz ¼ 100 000 Hz.
4. Coherence length therefore ¼ (3  108)/(2  100 000) ¼ 1500 m ¼ 1.5 km.
Example 2.2
A CO2 laser emitting at 10 600 nm has a Doppler-broadened gain curve that is 60 MHz wide. What is the
coherence length of such a laser? If the frequency of this laser is stabilized around the centre of its
Doppler-broadened gain curve to an accuracy of 1 MHz, what would be the new value of coherence
length? Also determine the line width (in nm) of the laser in the two cases.
Solution
1. Coherence length ¼
c
2Df ¼ l2
2Dl where the terms have their usual meaning.
2. Initially Df ¼ 60 MHz; so coherence length ¼ (3  108)/(2  60  106) ¼ 2.5 m.
3. When the laser is frequency stabilized, Df ¼ 2 MHz. The new coherence length ¼ (3  108)/
(2  2  106) ¼ 75 m.
4. Line width can be computed from Dl ¼ l2/(2  coherence length). In the case of an unstabilized
laser, Dl ¼ (10 600  109)2/(2  2.5) m ¼ 0.022 47 nm. In the case of a stabilized laser, Dl ¼
[(10 600  10 600  1018)/(2  75)] m ¼ 0.00075 nm.
Example 2.3
In Young’s double slit experiment, the separation between two successive bright fringes was precisely
measured to be equal to 3.164 mm. If the slit separation and slit-screen distance are 0.1 mm and 50 cm
respectively, determine the laser wavelength.
Solution
1. Refer to Figure 2.3b. For small values of angle u,
sin u ﬃu ¼ ml=d
ð
Þ and also tan u ﬃu ¼ ym=L
ð
Þ
where ym is the distance of the mth bright fringe from the central maximum.
This gives ym ¼ mlL=d
ð
Þ
2. This also gives a distance of the (m þ 1)th bright fringe from the central maximum as ðm þ 1ÞlL=d
½
.
Therefore, the separation between the two successive fringes equals lL=d
ð
Þ.
3. Substituting the given values of L, d and the distance between two successive fringes, we get
3:164  103 ¼ 50  102  l=0:1  103 ¼ 5000l
which gives l ¼ 3.164  103/5000 ¼ 632.8 nm.

Example 2.4
In a Michelson interferometer experimental set-up, the interference pattern was observed to move by 200
fringes with respect to a reference point when a 0.1-mm-thick glass plate having a refractive index of
1.546 was inserted in the path of one of the beams. Determine the wavelength of the laser source.
Solution
1. Let us assume that the thickness of glass plate inserted in the optical path is T.
2. The phase difference in terms of number of wavelengths introduced by this insertion is therefore
2T=ln
ð
Þ, where ln is the wavelength of the laser in the glass, equal to l/n where l is the free-space
wavelength or the wavelength in air and n is the refractive index of the material.
3. An equivalent air space of length T would have caused a phase difference of 2T=l in terms of the
number of wavelengths.
4. Therefore, additional phase difference in terms of the number of wavelengths introduced due to
thickness T of glass equals: 2nT=l
ð
Þ  2T=l
ð
Þ ¼ 2T n  1
ð
Þ=l.
5. If N is the number of fringes observed to move with respect to a reference point because of the
insertion of the glass plate, then N ¼ 2Tðn  1Þ=l.
6. This gives l ¼ 2Tðn  1Þ=N.
7. Substituting the given values, l ¼ 2  0.1  103  (1.546  1)/200 ¼ 546 nm.
2.3
Important Laser Parameters
In many applications including industrial, medical, military and scientiﬁc, the measurement of laser
power or energy is often not adequate and it becomes necessary to measure many other beam parameters
related to its shape and intensity proﬁle. In addition, we are also interested in knowing how these
parameters change as the laser beam propagates through atmosphere. For example, in the case of a laser
target designator, in addition to laser energy per pulse and pulse width, beam divergence is another
important parameter that determines the operational range of the system. On the other hand, in the case of
a laser intended for spectroscopy applications, the line width and wavelength stability are the parameters
that demand special attention. In the following sections we discuss the important parameters which both
designers and users of laser systems are interested in:
1. wavelength
2. CW power (CW lasers)
3. peak power (pulsed lasers)
4. average power (pulsed lasers)
5. pulse energy (pulsed lasers)
6. repetition rate (pulsed lasers)
7. pulse width (pulsed lasers)
8. duty cycle (pulsed lasers)
9. rise and fall times
10. irradiance
11. radiance
12. beam divergence
13. spot size
14. M2 value
15. wall-plug efﬁciency.
2.3.1
Wavelength
Wavelength is of course the ﬁrst and the foremost parameter with which the laser is identiﬁed. It is in a
way laser-speciﬁc. There are lasers which can possibly emit at more than one wavelength, however.
While Nd:YAG is always associated with 1064 nm, a He-Ne laser can emit at 632.8 nm, 543 nm, 1150 nm
Laser Characteristics
41

and 3390 nm. There are some lasers that can be tuned across a band. The vibronic class of solid-state
lasers, dye lasers and free electron lasers belong to this category. Table 2.2 lists the wavelengths of some
well-known lasers.
2.3.2
CW Power
CW power is the power available from the CW laser. The typical laser output power level may vary from
a fraction of a milliwatt in a He-Ne laser or a semiconductor diode laser used in laser pointers to hundreds
of kilowatts or even several megawatts in high-power lasers. Other power parameters are the peak power
and average power deﬁned with reference to pulsed lasers.
2.3.3
Peak Power
Peak power is the highest instantaneous optical power in the laser pulse (Figure 2.4). Although peak
power occurs only for a time duration which is a small fraction of the pulse width, it is considered to be
present during the entire pulse width. This greatly simpliﬁes average power and energy calculations.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Peak power is of particular relevance to laser systems such as laser range ﬁnders and laser target
designators, as it is one of the important parameters that determine the maximum operational range of
these systems. The peak power speciﬁcation in the case of military laser range ﬁnders and target
designators conﬁgured around Q-switched (where Q stands for the quality factor of the resonant cavity)
solid-state lasers is in the range of 1–10 MW.
2.3.4
Average Power
Average power is the product of peak power and the duty cycle (Figure 2.4). It can also be written as the
product of pulse energy and the repetition rate. A laser target designator producing 100 mJ of pulse
energy in a 20 ns pulse at a repetition rate of 20 pulses per second (pps) will have peak power and average
power speciﬁcations of 5 MW and 2 W, respectively.
2.3.5
Pulse Energy
Pulse energy is deﬁned with respect to pulsed lasers. It is in fact the area under the power versus time
curve representing the laser pulse. If the laser pulse is considered as rectangular with amplitude equal to
the peak power, the pulse energy is the product of peak power and the pulse width. If the laser pulse
(which has a Gaussian proﬁle) is approximated as an isosceles triangle as shown in Figure 2.5 and the
pulse width is measured as the full width at the points of half of the peak power, the area under the curve
is the product of peak power and the pulse width.
2.3.6
Repetition Rate
Repetition rate, also referred to as pulse repetition frequency, of a pulsed laser is the number of laser
pulses produced per second. It is equal to the reciprocal of the time interval between two successive laser
pulses (Figure 2.4). Repetition rate is of particular signiﬁcance in laser systems such as laser target
designators used for guided-weapon delivery applications.
Figure 2.5
Computation of pulse energy of a Gaussian pulse.
Laser Characteristics
43

2.3.7
Pulse Width
Pulse width (or pulse duration in the case of a pulsed laser) is usually measured as full width at half
maximum (FWHM) as shown in Figure 2.5. Pulse width is intimately related to bandwidth. The narrower
the pulse width, the higher is the required bandwidth. In fact, Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle sets a
limit on the minimum possible laser pulse width for a given value of available bandwidth. That is:
Minimum pulse width ¼ 0:441=bandwidth
(2.4)
We also have:
Minimum bandwidth ¼ 0:441=pulse width
(2.5)
Pulse width could be few femtoseconds (1015 of a second) to hundreds of femtoseconds in the case of
some mode-locked lasers, a few nanoseconds to several tens of nanoseconds in the case of Q-switched
solid-state lasers, and a few tens of microseconds to hundreds of microseconds in case of free-running
lasers.
2.3.8
Duty Cycle
Duty cycle is the ratio of pulse width to the time interval between two successive pulses (Figure 2.4).
Duty cycle in the case of a laser target designator producing 20-ns-wide laser pulses at a repetition rate of
20 pps is 0.000 000 4.
Peak power, average power, pulse width, pulse energy, repetition rate and duty cycle are interrelated.
The following mathematical expressions summarize their inter-relationship:
Pulse energy ¼ peak power  pulse width
(2.6)
Average power ¼ peak power  duty cycle ¼ pulse energy  repetition rate
(2.7)
Peak power ¼ pulse energy=pulse width
(2.8)
Duty cycle ¼ pulse width  repetition rate
(2.9)
Example 2.5
Determine the following:
1. peak power of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser producing 100 mJ, 20 ns pulses,
2. average power of a 120 mJ, 50 ns Nd:Glass laser operating at 10 pps and
3. pulse energy of a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser producing 10 MW peak power, 10 ns laser pulses.

 Pulse energy ¼ 120 mJ

Example 2.6
An Nd:YAG laser emits 1064 nm with a bandwidth of 0.1 nm. Determine the minimum possible laser
pulse duration achievable from this laser without using any special techniques.
Solution: Wavelength, l ¼ 1064 nm
Bandwidth, Dl ¼ 0.1 nm
Frequency, f ¼ c=l ¼ 3  108/1064  109 Hz ¼ 2.8  1014 Hz
This gives Df ¼ (0.1  109/1064  109)  2.8  1014 Hz ¼ 2.63  1010 Hz ¼ 26.3 GHz
Minimum possible pulse duration ¼ 0:441=Df ¼ (0.441/26.3  109) s ¼ 0.0168 ns ¼ 16.8 ps.
2.3.9
Rise and Fall Times
Rise and fall times refer to the time duration between 10% and 90% of the peak amplitude of the pulse
during rising and falling portions of the laser pulse, respectively. Pulse rise time becomes particularly
important while designing opto-electronic front-end circuits for converting a laser radiation pulse into an
equivalent electrical signal. The bandwidth of the current-to-voltage converter needs to be commensu-
rate with the rise time speciﬁcation. For example, a 10 ns laser pulse with a rise time of 2 ns not only
needs an optical sensor with a rise time speciﬁcation of 2 ns or better, but the trans-impedance ampliﬁer
used to transform photocurrent into an equivalent voltage pulse also needs to have a bandwidth of
175 MHz (¼ 350/2) or better to faithfully reproduce the pulse.
2.3.10
Irradiance
Irradiance, also referred to as power density, is deﬁned as the power per unit area of the laser radiation
falling on the target. It is expressed in units of W m2. This parameter is particularly important when the
laser radiation is used to illuminate a receiving system. The laser power actually entering the receiver
system depends upon the receiving aperture and the power density available at that plane. A typical
example where the irradiance parameter assumes importance is the use of a high-energy laser system in a
countermeasure mode to saturate or damage distant electro-optic sensor systems such as laser range
ﬁnders and laser target designators. In such a situation, the laser source needs to produce a certain
minimum irradiance at the target plane to be able to produce the desired effect.
2.3.11
Radiance
Radiance, also referred to as brightness, is usually deﬁned with respect to the laser source. It is the power
emitted per unit area per unit solid angle, expressed as W m2 sr1. For small values of angle, planar
angle u is related to solid angle V by V ¼ ðp=4Þu2. Quite obviously, a small exit beam diameter and
lower divergence mean higher radiance or brightness.
Example 2.7
Determine the radiance of a 5 mW helium-neon laser having an output diameter of 2 mm and a
divergence of 1 mrad.
Solution
1. Divergence ¼ 1 mrad
2. Corresponding solid angle ¼ (p/4) (103)2 ¼ 0.785  106 sr

3. Laser spot area ¼ (p/4) (2  103)2 ¼ 3.14  106 m2
4. Power ¼ 5  103 W
5. Therefore, radiance ¼ (5  103)/(3.14  106)  (0.785  106) ¼ 2  109 W m2 sr1.
2.3.12
Beam Divergence
Beam divergence is an indicator of the spread in the laser beam spot as it travels away from the source. It
is a function of the wavelength l and size of output optics. If D is diameter of output optics, then
u ¼ ð1:27lÞ=d
(2.10)
where u is the divergence in radians.
For a given l, larger D leads to smaller divergence. This of course is the minimum value of divergence
the laser can have, assuming that it is transmitting the fundamental transverse mode TEM00. In the
presence of higher-order transverse modes, the beam divergence increases more rapidly. The divergence
parameter determines the spot size in the far ﬁeld. If u is full-angle divergence in radians and d the spot
diameter at a distance R (m) (Figure 2.6), then u ¼ ðd=RÞ assuming that the value of u is very small. If u is
measured in milli-radians and R is in kilometres, then d is in metres. In fact, the exact expression for the
spot diameter d is given by:
d ¼ D þ Ru
(2.11)
which approximates to d ¼ Ru for large values of R.
Beam divergence is one of the important parameters that determine the maximum operational range of
laser systems such as laser range ﬁnders and laser target designators. Divergence determines the laser spot
diameter at the target and therefore the power density for a given peak power. It is the power density and not
the absolutevalue of power that determines the power enteringthe receiver channel of these systems. When
the divergent laser beam is made to fall on a positive lens, the diameter of the focused spot is the product of
the focal length of the lens and the divergence of the incident laser radiation. For a given focal length, the
focused spot size is therefore a function of the divergence of the incident laser beam.
Example 2.8
A laser range ﬁnder produces a laser spot of diameter 4 m at a target located at a distance of 8 km from the
source. Determine the full angle divergence of the laser beam.
Solution
Full angle divergence in milliradians is given by spot diameter (in m)/target range (in km) ¼
4/8 ¼ 0.5 mrad.

Example 2.9
Determine the beam divergence of a helium-neon laser beam emitting at 632.8 nm with an exit aperture
of 2 mm. If this beam is made to fall on an appositive lens of 5 cm focal length, determine the minimum
expected value of the focused spot size.
Solution
1. Wavelength l ¼ 632.8 nm and exit aperture ¼ 2 mm. Therefore, divergence u ¼ 1.27  632.8  109/

2. Focal length of positive lens ¼ 5 cm. Therefore, diameter of focused spot¼ 5  102 0.4
103¼ 20 mm.
2.3.13
Spot Size
Spot size or the beam diameter is deﬁned as the distance across the centre of the beam for which the
irradiance equals 0.135 (¼ 1/e2) times the maximum value at the centre (Figure 2.7). This implies that if the
laser beam were made to fall on a circular aperture of diameter equal to the laser beam diameter as deﬁned
abovewith thecentreofthebeamcoinciding withthe centreofthe aperture,notalllaserpower istransmitted

(2.12)
where r is the radius of aperture and w is the spot radius.
Example 2.10
A laser beam is centred upon a circular aperture of diameter that is twice the laser beam diameter. Prove

Example 2.11
The power of a 5 mW helium-neon laser reduces to 2 mW after passing through a circular aperture of
2 mm diameter. Determine the diameter of the incident laser beam.
Solution
1. Fractional transmission through the aperture ¼ 2/5 ¼ 0.4. Also, (Aperture diameter/laser beam
diameter)2 ¼  [ln(1  T)]/2 ¼  [ln(1  0.4)]/2 ¼ 0.51/2 ¼ 0.255.
2. Therefore, Aperture diameter/Laser beam diameter ¼ p(0.255) ¼ 0.505.
3. This gives laser beam diameter ¼ 2/0.505 ¼ 3.96 mm.
2.3.14
M2 Value
M2 value is a measure of beam quality. When the laser beam propagates through space, the divergence in
the case of an unfocused pure Gaussian beam is given by 4l/pD, where D is the diameter of the beam
waist. In the case of real beams the divergence is higher due to various factors, such as presence of
additional modes, and the equation for divergence is usually written as M2  4l=pD with M2 > 1. M2 is
therefore deﬁned as the ratio of the divergence of the real beam to that of a theoretical diffraction-limited
beam of the same waist size with a Gaussian beam proﬁle (TEM00 mode). It is also referred to as the
beam propagation ratio as per ISO-11146 standard. Also, the closer a real beam is to a diffraction-limited
beam, the more tightly it can be focused and the greater the depth of ﬁeld and smaller the size of beam
handling optics. The focal spot size in the case of real beam is M2 times the focal spot size of the pure
Gaussian beam. Also, the angular size of the real beam in the far ﬁeld is M2 times that of a perfect
Gaussian beam (Figure 2.8).
2.3.15
Wall-plug Efﬁciency
Wall-plug efﬁciency is the overall efﬁciency of the laser system. It is the ratio of laser power produced
(CW power or average power as applicable) to the power drawn from the source of input. As an example,
a military laser designator producing 20 ns, 100 mJ pulses at 20 pps and drawing 12.5 A at 24 V DC
would have a wall-plug efﬁciency of (100  103  20)/(24  12.5) ¼ 2/300 ¼ 0.67%.
Example 2.12
In a solid-state laser system, power conversion efﬁciency of the power supply is 80%. 70% of this
electrical energy is converted into optical output energy of the ﬂash lamp. Only 30% of this optical
energy is absorbed by the active medium. Further, 30% of the absorbed energy causes the excited atoms

in the metastable state to be available for lasing action. Finally, 40% of this produces laser output.
Determine the wall-plug efﬁciency of this laser.
Solution:
Wall-plug efﬁciency is given by 0.8  0.7  0.3  0.3  0.4 ¼ 0.02 ¼ 2%.
2.4
Measurement of Laser Parameters
Section 2.3 describes the important parameters of laser radiation. In this section we discuss the
experimental techniques and diagnostic instrumentation available for the measurement of these
parameters. Measurement solutions are discussed in the following sections for the following parameters:
1. power (CW lasers)
2. average power and pulse energy (pulsed lasers)
3. repetition rate (repetitively pulsed lasers)
4. spot size
5. divergence
6. M2 value
7. line width.
2.4.1
Measurement of Power, Energy and Repetition Rate
A wide range of laser power/energy meters is commercially available from a host of manufacturers
covering the wavelength range from short-ultraviolet to far-infrared, CW power levels from nanowatts to
kilowatts, pulse energies from nanojoules to hundreds of joules and repetition rate up to several kilohertz.
Meters are also available for making these measurements on both collimated and widely diverging
beams such as those from diode lasers.
These measurement systems are invariably modular in nature, comprising a sensor head connected to a
meter/display unit. Almost all manufacturers offer meters that are compatible with a range of sensor
heads, enabling the user to have a wide range of measurement capability from a single meter and multiple
sensor heads.
Measurement of CW power, average power, pulse energy and repetition rate are interrelated functions;
most of the state-of-the-art laser power/energy meters are capable of measuring these parameters.
Measurement of these parameters is therefore covered under a common heading.
2.4.1.1
Choosing the Appropriate Sensor
Choosing the appropriate power/energy measurement solution is usually a three-step process involving
selection of the appropriate sensor head, understanding the required meter capabilities and ensuring
compatibility of the chosen sensor head with the selected meter.
Selection criteria for the sensor head are based on the nature and range of expected values of the laser
parameters to be measured. There are three broad categories of sensor heads commonly used for the
purpose: thermal or, more precisely, thermopile sensors, photodiode sensors and pyroelectric sensors.
Each of the three types has its own characteristic features suiting a particular measurement requirement.
In the case of thermopile sensors, the incident laser radiation is absorbed and converted to heat. The
heat ultimately ﬂows to a heat sink maintained at a near-constant temperature by either water or air
cooling. The differential temperature between the absorber and that of the heat sink represents the
amplitude of absorbed laser energy. A thermocouple junction converts this temperature difference into
an equivalent electrical signal.
These sensors are characterized by a broad spectral response from ultraviolet to far-infrared, wide
dynamic range from tens of microwatts to several kilowatts and a uniform spatial response. Their
response is not affected by beam size, position or uniformity. The disadvantage of these sensors is their
sluggish response. Response time ranges from 1 to 50 seconds depending on sensor size, increasing with
Laser Characteristics
49

larger sensor size. These sensors are therefore best suited for measurement of CW power, average power
in repetitively pulsed lasers and energy of long laser pulses.
In the case of photodiode sensors, photons in the incident laser radiation generate charge carriers
which can be sensed either as a current or a voltage. These are characterized by a limited spectral
response (typically from 200 nm to 1800 nm), high sensitivity (typically a few nanowatts),
low noise, fast response time (typically a few nanoseconds) and relatively lower spatial uniformity.
Lower spatial uniformity particularly affects measurements of non-uniform beams and beams
that wander over the detector active area between successive measurements. These sensors
particularly suit low-power measurements in CW lasers. These sensors saturate above a power
density of about 1 mW cm2, necessitating the use of optical attenuators for the measurement of
higher power levels.
Pyroelectric sensors are also a type of thermal sensor like the thermopile sensor; the difference is that
pyroelectric sensors respond to a rate of change of temperature rather than an absolute value of
temperature difference. These sensors essentially act like capacitors and therefore integrate pulses to
produce a signal with a peak proportional to laser energy. They are ideally suited to measurement of
parameters of pulsed lasers. As for thermopile sensors, these are also characterized by a broad spectral
response.
2.4.1.2
Choosing the Appropriate Meter
As outlined earlier, state-of-the-art meters offer both power and energy measurement options and are
compatible with all three categories of sensor heads. When coupled to different sensors, these meters
offer measurement of CW power, average power, pulse energy and repetition rate. One such meter is
FieldMaxII-Top by Coherent (Figure 2.9). It is capable of power measurement in the range of 10 mW to
30 kW when used a thermopile sensor head and 1 nW to 300 mW when used with a photodiode sensor
head. Energy measurement in the range of 1 nJ to 300 J is possible with a pyroelectric sensor head.
Maximum repetition rate in the case of pulse energy measurement is 300 Hz.
2.4.2
Measurement of Spot Size
A simple technique for measuring spot size is by measuring fractional transmission through a known
aperture placed in the path of the beam (Figure 2.10). The aperture is placed in the path of the laser beam
and adjusted in such a way that the power meter records maximum power. Aperture size should be such
that the recorded power is in the range of 50–90% of the power recorded without aperture. Beam radius
can then be computed from Equation 2.13:
r=w
ð
Þ ¼

jlnð1  TÞj=2
p
(2.13)
where
r ¼ aperture radius
T ¼ fractional transmission through aperture ¼ power with aperture/power without aperture
w ¼ beam radius
2.4.3
Measurement of Divergence
Beam divergence can be computed by measuring the beam diameter at two points at known distances as
shown in Figure 2.11. Full angle beam divergence in this case is given by Equation 2.14:
u 	 ðd2  d1Þ=ðR2  R1Þ
(2.14)
50

The expressions for computing beam divergence given above are valid for the region in the far ﬁeld
deﬁned by Equation 2.15:
Far field 
 ð100  D2Þ=l
(2.15)
where D is the diameter of output optics and l is the wavelength of the laser beam.
There is another region referred to as near ﬁeld deﬁned by Equation 2.16:
Near field  D2=l
(2.16)
where D is the diameter of the output optics and l is the wavelength of laser beam.
It may be mentioned here that near-ﬁeld divergence may be different from far-ﬁeld divergence; an
explanation of this is beyond the scope of the book.
2.4.4
Measurement of M2 Value
In the case of real beams, the M2 value is measured by focusing the beam with the help of a lens of known
focal length. A beam proﬁler arrangement conﬁgured around either moving knife edges or special
cameras is used to measure the beam waist. The M2 value cannot be determined from a single beam
proﬁle measurement; it is computed from the data generated from a series of measurements. Figure 2.12
Figure 2.11
Measurement of beam divergence.
Figure 2.12
M2 value measurement set-up using ﬁxed position lens and moving detector.
52
Lasers and Optoelectronics

shows one such set-up that uses a camera-based beam-proﬁle measurement. The set-up uses a ﬁxed
position lens and a moving detector (camera in this case) to make multiple measurements in the beam
waist region. This design is used in the Spiricon M2-200 Beam Propagation Analyzer.
An alternative set-up uses a ﬁxed position detector and a scanning lens assembly (Figure 2.13). The
Mode Master PC M2 Beam Propagation Analyzer from Coherent is built around this design philosophy.
It uses a dual knife-edge beam proﬁler integrated with a diffraction-limited precision scanning lens. The
focusing lens creates an internal beam waist and the two orthogonal knife edges mounted on a rotating
drum measure the beam diameter and the corresponding beam axis location at multiple planes along the
beam waist. The M2 value is then computed from the multiple beam width measurements along with their
location on the beam axis and the known characteristics of the focusing lens.
2.4.5
Measurement of Line Width
Line width of laser radiation can be measured by a variety of techniques. These include traditional
techniques of optical spectrum analysis, for instance use of: diffraction gratings; a frequency discrimi-
nator conﬁgured around an unbalanced interferometer or a high-ﬁnesse reference cavity to transform
frequency variations to intensity variations; self-heterodyne technique; extended self-heterodyne
technique using a recirculating ﬁbre loop with an internal ﬁbre ampliﬁer; heterodyne technique using
a reference laser with signiﬁcantly better frequency stability than that of the laser under test; and
frequency combs for line width measurements over a wide spectral range.
The diffraction-grating-based optical spectrum analysis technique is suitable for measurement of large
line widths exceeding 10 GHz, as obtained in presence of multiple modes. For smaller line widths the
self-heterodyne technique is often used, which involves recording a beat note between the output of the
laser under test and a frequency-shifted and delayed version of it. For sub-kHz line widths, use of a
recirculating ﬁbre loop with an internal ﬁbre ampliﬁer may extend the capability of self-heterodyne
technique. For even smaller line widths, the heterodyne technique that records a beat note between the
output of the laser under test and that from a reference laser having a relatively much higher frequency
Figure 2.13
M2 value measurement set-up using scanning lens and ﬁxed position detector.
Laser Characteristics
53

stability is the preferred solution. In the case where the line width is to be measured over a wide spectral
range, frequency comb laser sources may be used as a source of a reference laser.
Figure 2.14 shows the schematic arrangement of a self-heterodyne method for measuring line width. It
is basically an interferometric technique which is particularly suitable for the measurement of relatively
smaller line widths such as those from single frequency lasers. A beam splitter splits the output of the
laser under test into two beams. One part of the laser beam travels through a long optical ﬁbre, which
provides some time delay. The other part passes through an acousto-optic modulator, which shifts all
frequency components present in the beam under test by some tens of MHz. The time delay introduced
by the ﬁbre should be larger than the coherence length of the laser under test. The two beams are then
superimposed on a beam splitter and the resulting beat note centred on the frequency of the acousto-optic
modulator is recorded to compute the line width. Time delay longer than the coherence length ensures
that the superimposed beams are essentially uncorrelated and the beat spectrum is a simple self-
convolution of the laser output spectrum from which the laser line width can be easily retrieved.
However, it may become impractical to fulﬁl the condition of time delay being longer than coherence
length in the case of lasers with very narrow line widths of the order of sub-kHz. A recirculating ﬁbre
loop with an internal ﬁbre ampliﬁer overcomes this limitation.
Figure 2.15 shows the test set-up. A recirculating ﬁbre loop is a ﬁbre-optical arrangement which
allows the laser light to do many rounds in the ﬁbre, thus simulating a much longer effective ﬁbre length
Figure 2.14
Self-heterodyne method of line width measurement.
Figure 2.15
Extended self-heterodyne technique by using recirculating ﬁbre loop.
54
Lasers and Optoelectronics

than would be available in the case of a single traverse. The acousto-optic modulator keeps the light from
round trips well separated in frequency. The modulator shifts the optical frequency in each trip by about
100 MHz. The beat spectrum contains beat notes of the original laser light with different frequency-
shifted components. Loss of signal in the ﬁbre and also the acousto-optic modulator due to multiple
round trips strongly limits the number of round trips. The insertion of ﬁbre ampliﬁer in the loop
overcomes this limitation.
Figure 2.16 shows the heterodyne set-up that uses a separate reference laser instead of extracting the
second laser beam required for heterodyne action from the laser beam under test.
A frequency comb laser source can be used to extend the spectral range of the measurement of line
width. A frequency comb (Figure 2.17) is an optical spectrum with equidistant lines, and can be used to
measure unknown frequencies by measuring the beat notes between the unknown frequency and the
comb frequencies. Frequency comb laser sources are now commercially available from multiple sources
and are being increasingly used for laser metrology.

2.5
Laser Beam Diagnostic Equipment
Section 2.4 brieﬂy described the basic techniques available to us for the measurement of important laser
parameters. Awide range of laser power and energy meters are commercially available to meet different
measurement requirements of laser power, energy and other related parameters. Alternatively, laser
beam diagnostic equipment allows precise measurement of parameters related to its shape and proﬁle.
These test and measuring instruments include wavelength meters, laser spectrum analyzers, beam
proﬁlers and beam propagation analyzers. The functions performed by each of these along with other
salient features available in the modern diagnostic equipment are brieﬂy described in the following
sections.
2.5.1
Wavelength Meter
A wavelength meter is used for the measurement of wavelength of the laser radiation. One such
equipment is the WaveMasterTM Laser Wavelength meter from Coherent (Figure 2.18). It measures the
wavelength of both CW and pulsed lasers of any pulse repetition frequency (PRF) in the wavelength
range 380–1095 nm. Wavelength reading can be displayed in nanometres, wave numbers or GHz.
Measurement of wavelength in both air and vacuum are possible. Wavelength is measured with 0.001 nm
resolution and 0.005 nm accuracy. The equipment comes with a built-in RS-232 (recommended
standard) and an optional general-purpose input-output (GPIB) interface.
2.5.2
Laser Spectrum Analyzer
A laser spectrum analyzer is used to carry out modal analysis of lasers operating in more than one
longitudinal or transverse mode of the laser cavity. The spectrum analyzer typically uses a scanning
Fabry-Perot interferometer cavity. The resonant frequency of the interferometer is scanned by varying
the spacing between the cavity mirrors with the help of a piezoelectric spacer segment placed between
the two mirrors. Laser light transmitted through the cavity to a detector has only those line spectra that
match the resonant spectral frequency of the cavity. An oscilloscope synchronized to the cavity scan rate
then displays the detected spectra of different laser lines.
One such piece of equipment is SAPlus Laser Spectrum Analyzer from Artisan Scientiﬁc (Fig-
ure 2.19). The equipment provides modal analysis in the wavelength range of 450–1800 nm. It offers free
spectral range choice of 2 GHz or 8 GHz. It is capable of measuring the line width, longitudinal mode
structure and frequency stability of narrow band lasers.
Figure 2.20 depicts the spectrum analyzer. As shown in the ﬁgure, it utilizes a scanning confocal
Fabry-Perot interferometer cavity comprising two concave mirrors, with the spacer separating the two
mirrors having a piezoelectric section. When driven electrically from the controller, the piezoelectric
Figure 2.18

Lasers and Optoelectronics

section can be used to vary the mirror spacing and thus the resonance frequency of the cavity. Free
spectral range in this case is given by c/4d where d is the mean mirror separation. The purpose of the lens
assembly is to match the laser beam to the input aperture of the confocal cavity. The laser beam can be
directed straight into the spectrum analyzer or through a beam splitter that allows only a fraction of the
laser beam (about 10% in this case) to the spectrum analyzer.
2.5.3
Laser Beam Proﬁler
A laser beam proﬁler is used for the measurement of spatial intensity proﬁle and other related parameters
of the laser beam. As the laser beam propagates, the width and spatial intensity proﬁle of the beam
changes. The spatial intensity distribution of the laser beam is a very important parameter when it comes
to studying its behaviour in any application.
There are two types of proﬁlers in use. One of the types uses special cameras as detectors and offers an
excellent solution to fast and detailed analyses of CW and pulsed lasers. The other type uses moving
knife edges, which is particularly attractive for carrying out measurements on small and focused beams
and if a large dynamic range is required. The Beam View Analyzer (Figure 2.21) and Beam Master
Proﬁler (Figure 2.22) from Coherent are examples of camera-based and moving knife-edge-based laser
beam proﬁlers.

2.5.4
Beam Propagation Analyzer
A laser beam propagation analyzer is used for measurement of beam quality (M2 value) and other beam
propagation analysis functions for CW lasers. State-of-the-art beam propagation analyzers offer
measurement functions which include beam quality (M2 value), beam diameter, second moment
diameter, divergence, divergence asymmetry, astigmatism, astigmatism asymmetry, pointing stability,
waist diameter and location, waist asymmetry, beam proﬁles, power density and Rayleigh range.
ModeMaster PC (Figure 2.23) is one such beam propagation analyzer from Coherent. It comprises a dual
knife-edge beam proﬁler integrated with servo-controlled diffraction-limited scanning lens. The lens
focuses the beam to create an internal beam waist and the two orthogonal knife edges mounted on a
rotating drum measure beam diameter and corresponding beam axis location at 256 planes along the
beam waist. The software provided with the system determines different parameters listed above from
the data generated during the course of a large number of measurements.

Summary
 Three important characteristics of lasers include monochromaticity, directionality and coherence.
Monochromaticity refers to the single frequency or wavelength property of the radiation. Laser
radiation is monochromatic and this property has its origin in the stimulated emission process by
which lasers emit light. Light is said to be coherent when different photons (or the waves associated
with those photons) have the same phase and this phase relationship is preserved as a function of time.
There are two types of coherence: temporal coherence and spatial coherence. Temporal coherence is
preservation of phase relationship with time and spatial coherence is preservation of phase across the
width of the beam. The directionality of laser radiation has its origin in the coherence of the stimulated
emission process.
 The important laser parameters include wavelength, output power (in case of CW lasers), output
energy/pulse (in the case of pulsed lasers), irradiance, radiance, pulse width, duty cycle, repetition rate
(in the case of pulsed lasers), beam divergence, spot size, M2 value and wall-plug efﬁciency.
 CW power is the continuous power available from the laser. Peak power and average power are the
other related parameters. Peak power is the highest instantaneous power in the laser pulse. Average
power is the product of peak power and the duty cycle, where duty cycle is the ratio of the pulse width
to the time interval between two successive laser pulses.
 Pulse energy is deﬁned with respect to pulsed lasers and is equal to the area under the power versus
time curve representing the laser pulse. If the laser pulse is considered as rectangular with amplitude
equal to the peak power, the pulse energy is the product of peak power and the pulse width.
Figure 2.23

 Repetition rate is the number of laser pulses produced per second. The product of pulse energy and
repetition rate gives average power.
 Pulse width or pulse duration is usually measured as FWHM. It is intimately related to bandwidth. The
narrower the pulse width, the higher is the required bandwidth.
 Beam divergence is an indicator of the spread in the laser beam spot as it travels away from the source.
It is a function of the wavelength l and size of output optics.
 Irradiance, also referred to as power density, is deﬁned as the power per unit area of the laser radiation
falling on the target.
 Radiance, also referred to as brightness, is usually deﬁned with respect to the laser source. It is the
power emitted per unit area per unit solid angle.
 Spot size or the beam diameter is deﬁned as the distance across the centre of the beam for which the
irradiance equals 0.135 (¼ 1/e2) times the maximum value at the centre.
 M2 value is a measure of beam quality. It is deﬁned as the ratio of the divergence of the real beam to
that of a theoretical diffraction-limited beam of the same waist size with a Gaussian beam proﬁle
(TEM00 mode).
 Wall-plug efﬁciency is the overall efﬁciency of the laser system. It is the ratio of laser power produced
(CW power or average power as applicable) to the power drawn from source of input.
 For measurement of power, energy and other related parameters, a wide range of laser power/energy
meters is commercially available from a host of reputable manufacturers covering wavelength range
from short-ultraviolet to far-infrared, CW power levels from nanowatts to kilowatts, pulse energies
from nanojoules to hundreds of joules and a repetition rate to several kilohertz. Meters are also
available for making these measurements on both collimated as well as widely diverging beams such
as those from diode lasers.
 Although sophisticated beam diagnostic instruments are available for the measurement of laser beam
proﬁle and related parameters, a simple technique for measuring spot size is to measure fractional
transmission through a known aperture placed in the path of the beam.
 A simple experimental set-up to measure beam divergence is to measure the beam diameter at two
points at known distances.
 Line width of a laser radiation can be measured by a variety of techniques. These include the
traditional techniques of optical spectrum analysis, for instance using diffraction gratings, a
frequency discriminator conﬁgured around an unbalanced interferometer or a high-ﬁnesse
reference cavity to transform frequency variations to intensity variations, self-heterodyne
technique, extended self-heterodyne technique using a re-circulating ﬁbre loop with an internal
ﬁbre ampliﬁer, heterodyne technique using a reference laser with signiﬁcantly better frequency
stability than that of the laser under test and frequency combs for line width measurements over a
wide spectral range.
 Laser beam diagnostic equipment allow precise measurement of parameters related to the shape and
proﬁle of the beam. These instruments include wavelength meters, laser spectrum analyzers, beam
proﬁlers and beam propagation analyzers.
 Awavelength meter is used for measurement of wavelength. A laser spectrum analyzer is used to carry
out modal analysis of lasers operating in more than one longitudinal or transverse mode of the laser
cavity. A laser beam proﬁler is used for measurement of spatial intensity proﬁle and other related
parameters of the laser beam. Finally, a laser beam propagation analyzer is used for measurement of
beam quality (M2 value) and other beam propagation analysis functions for CW lasers.

Solid-state Lasers
3.1
Introduction: Types of Lasers
Lasers are classiﬁed on the basis of various parameters, such as the nature of the active medium:
1. solid-state lasers
2. semiconductor lasers
3. gas lasers.
In addition, there are a large number of other varieties of lasers that do not ﬁt any of the above-
mentioned broad categories (dye lasers, excimer lasers, metal vapour lasers, free electron lasers, x-ray
lasers, chemical lasers and gas dynamic lasers).
Further, lasers can be classiﬁed according to the pumping mechanism (optically pumped lasers, gas
dynamic lasers, electrically pumped lasers) or the nature of the laser output in terms of power/energy
level or wavelength (visible lasers, infrared or IR lasers, continuous wave or CW lasers, pulsed lasers, Q-
switched lasers). Solid-state lasers are almost invariably pumped optically, gas lasers are excited by an
electrical discharge while semiconductor lasers are pumped by an electrical current ﬂowing through a
forward-biased diode junction.
The most important method of classifying lasers is on the basis of the nature of the lasing medium.
Solid-state lasers are discussed in this chapter, including the operational fundamentals of solid-state
lasers, their salient features and typical applications, and semiconductor and gas lasers are discussed in
Chapters 4 and 5, respectively.
3.2
Importance of Host Material
The active medium in the case of solid-state lasers is the lasing species embedded into a crystalline or a
glass host material. The characteristics of the host material are no less important than those of the lasing
species. The host material should have the required optical, mechanical and thermal properties in order to
favour homogenous propagation of light through the crystal: good beam quality (optical), high average
power operation and the ability to withstand severe operating conditions of practical laser systems
(mechanical and thermal properties). For instance, the host material should be reasonably transparent to
the pump radiation. It should not absorb radiation at either the pumping wavelength or laser wavelength.
It should have high thermal conductivity in order to allow CW operation or operation at high repetition
rates in the case of pulsed operation, leading to high average power operation.
Relatively poorer thermal conductivity in case of a glass host disallows the operation of an Nd:Glass
laser in CW mode, even at high repetition rates. On the other hand, an Nd:YAG laser, where the host
material is yttrium aluminium garnet (YAG, Y3Al5O12), can be made to operate in CW due to the far
Lasers and Optoelectronics: Fundamentals, Devices and Applications, First Edition. Anil K. Maini.

superior thermal conductivity of the host. Another point worth mentioning in connection with hosts of
solid-state lasers is the interaction of light-emitting species with the host material. This inﬂuences the
energy level structure of the active species, thus modifying the energy levels involved in the laser action.
As an illustration, the neodymium in the YAG host of a Nd:YAG laser emits at 1064 nm while the same
neodymium when doped in phosphate-based glass (Nd:Glass) acting as the host emits at 1054 nm. Going
a step further, neodymium in silicate glass emits at 1062 nm, and in fused silica glass at 1080 nm.
Yttrium lithium ﬂuoride (YLF) is another important host material popular with neodymium-based
solid-state lasers. It has fewer heat-related problems as compared to YAG. Also, Nd:YLF can store
more energy than its Nd:YAG counterpart and is therefore capable of generating higher-energy Q-
switched laser pulses. Due to its birefringent nature, it can produce laser output at 1047 nm and
1053 nm, each having its own polarization orientation. Birefringence is a property of polarization-
dependent refractive index.
Synthetic garnets other than YAG include popular host materials such as gadolinium gallium garnet
(GGG, Gd3Ga3O12) and gadolinium scandium gallium garnet (GSGG, Gd3Sc2Ga3O12). These host
materials have good thermal properties, are hard and optically isotropic. Good thermal properties permit
operation at high average power levels. Yttrium doped vanadate (YVO4) is yet another important host
material. Neodymium-doped YVO4 has a very large stimulated emission cross-section which makes it a
high-gain laser material, and a strong broadband absorption around 808 nm which makes it a highly
suitable material for laser diode pumping.
This interaction of active species with the host material sometimes assumes interesting proportions in
case of a special class of solid-state lasers called Vibronic (Vibrational-Electronic) lasers where the
electronic energy levels of the light emitting species interact with vibrational levels of the host and get
broadened. The lasing levels instead of being single levels get transformed to upper and lower lasing
bands. This feature makes this class of lasers tunable over a range of wavelengths. Important solid-state
lasers in this category include Titanium doped Sapphire (Sapphire is the host) and Alexandrite, which is
Chromium doped Chrysoberyl (Chrysoberyl is the host).
3.2.1
Lasing Species
Neodymium and chromium are the most widely exploited lasing species. Chromium is used in ruby
(chromium-doped aluminium oxide), alexandrite (chromium-doped chrysoberyl, BeAl2O4) and chro-
mium-doped GSGG. Titanium is used in titanium sapphire (titanium-doped Al2O3) lasers. Neodymium is
used in Nd:YAG and Nd:Glass lasers. Erbium is another lasing species, which in YAG and glass hosts give
the active medium for a rapidly emerging class of solid-state lasers referred to as ‘eye-safe’ lasers. These
lasers produce output at 1540 nm, which presents a much lower risk to the eye compared to neodymium
lasers. Neodymium lasers produce output at around 1064 nm, which is very dangerous to the eye.
Figure 3.1 shows the arrangement of different components of a typical solid-state laser comprising
active medium (usually in the shape of rod or slab), pumping source (ﬂash lamp, arc lamp, laser diode)
and a resonant structure. A specially contoured enclosure called a cavity houses the laser medium and the
pumping source, and a set of mirrors placed at either end of the medium transform this cavity into a
resonant cavity. In addition, the electronics drive the pumping source. Electronics accompanying a solid-
state laser are separately discussed at length in Chapter 8.
3.3
Operational Modes
Operational mode or methodology refers to the different resonator designs leading to different laser
output formats. The range of available output formats includes the following:
1. continuous wave (CW)
2. free-running
3. Q-switched
4. cavity-dumped
5. mode-locked.
68
Lasers and Optoelectronics

3.3.1
CW Output
In this operational mode, which is the simplest mode of operating a laser, the laser produces a continuous
output as long as the laser is pumped. Pumping needs to be continuous in this case. The laser resonator
simply comprises the active medium and the resonator mirrors, and does not contain any switches. In a
CW laser, the steady-state gain equals the loss and the excess pump power is converted into laser output.
Output of such a laser will ﬂuctuate due to the many ways in which different longitudinal and transverse
modes couple to each other via the active medium, unless means are used to control longitudinal and
transverse modes. A laser producing a single longitudinal mode and a single transverse mode may have
output ﬂuctuation of less than 1%.
3.3.2
Free-running Output
Free-running output a quasi-CW mode of operation in which the laser operates in the CW mode for a
time period of the order of a few hundreds of microseconds to a few milliseconds. This time period is
generally equal to or is slightly longer than the storage time of the active medium, which in turn is of the
same order as the pump input pulse. Refer to Figure 3.2 which shows the timing sequence of production
of a free-running pulsed output, that is, application of pump input and gain and loss response of the laser
resonator.
As is clear from the timing diagram, in the case of free-running output the steady-state gain equals the
loss and the excess pump power appears as the laser output. As the pump input exceeds a certain
threshold (where gain equals loss), laser radiation begins to appear at the output. Both gain and laser
output respond with overshoots, which ultimately damp out after a few cycles, and the output settles
down to the CW-like output as shown. Overshoots depend upon the rise time of the pump input. Faster
rise time leads to a larger overshoot.
3.3.3
Q-switched Output
Q-switching is a mechanism of producing short laser pulses with a pulse width of the order of a few
nanoseconds. The term Q-switching refers to rapidly switching the quality factor of the resonator cavity –
the ratio of energy stored per cycle to the energy lost per cycle – from a low to a high value. Refer to the
Figure 3.1
Components of a typical solid-state laser.
Solid-state Lasers
69

timing diagram of Figure 3.3. Initially, the Q-factor of the resonator cavity is kept at a very low value by
introducing an optical switch such as a Pockels cell and a polarizer. When the laser is pumped, it is
prohibited from lasing as it does in the case of a CWoutput. The obvious consequence of this is that the
active medium builds up a much higher population inversion density or gain than would have been
possible in the case of a CW laser. When the inversion density almost reaches its peak value the Q-factor
of the resonator cavity is rapidly switched to the high value, leading to a steep fall in the loss value. This
manifests itself in the production of a short laser pulse at the output as shown. The output laser pulse
begins to appear at the time instant where the loss becomes less than the gain and reaches the peak value
when the diminishing gain equals the loss. The gain then becomes less than the loss, which manifests
itself in the form of a falling laser output. These time instants can be observed more clearly if we expand
the timescale around the point where the Q-factor is switched from a low value to a high value
(Figure 3.4).
The pulse duration of a Q-switched pulse output depends upon resonator round-trip time, reﬂectivity
of the output coupler and the extent to which the active medium is pumped above the threshold. More
speciﬁcally, the pulse width depends primarily on the resonator cavity’s round-trip time and the resonator
gain to loss ratio. In an optimized Q-switched laser oscillator, the output laser pulse width is of the order
of a few times the cavity round-trip time, and may be typically in the range 10–50 ns. To a good

approximation, Q-switched pulse width can be computed from Equation 3.1:

(3.1)
where
tpq ¼ Q-switched pulse width
t

Laser cavity round-trip time can in turn be computed from Equation 3.2:
t ¼ 2Ln
c
(3.2)
where
L ¼ length of laser cavity
n ¼ refractive index of laser medium
3.3.4
Cavity-dumped Output
The phenomenon of cavity dumping is a slight variation of the Q-switching process with the difference
that, in case of the former, both of the resonator cavity mirrors are 100% reﬂective. When the active
medium is pumped, energy is initially stored in the population inversion as in the case of Q-switching.
During this time, the loss is at a very low value. Since both of the resonator mirrors are 100% reﬂective,
the ampliﬁed light remains trapped within the cavity. As peak irradiance is reached, the loss is again
switched to a high value thus ejecting the intra-cavity circulating energy in the form of a pulse. One of the
advantages of the cavity-dumping technique is that the output pulse width depends upon the cavity length
only and is independent of the gain characteristics of the active medium. More speciﬁcally, the pulse
width equals the round-trip cavity transit time provided that the Q-switch employed for switching the
quality factor of the cavity is also switched within the same time period. This technique allows
generation of output pulses of a few nanoseconds duration; the lower limit of the pulse width achievable
with this technique is 2–3 times smaller than that achievable with Q-switching. Figure 3.5 shows the
timing diagram of generation of a cavity-dumped output pulse.
In the case of cavity-dumped output, pulse width can be computed from Equation 3.3:
tpc ¼ 2Ln
c
(3.3)
where
tpc ¼ Q-switched pulse width
L
¼ Length of laser cavity
n
¼ Refractive index of laser medium.
3.3.5
Mode-locked Output
Minimum pulse width achievable from the laser is intimately related to its frequency bandwidth.
Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle (Section 2.3.7) sets a limit on the minimum possible laser pulse width
72
Lasers and Optoelectronics

for a given value of available bandwidth. That is,
tp ¼ 0:441
B
(3.4)
where
tp ¼ Minimum pulse width
B ¼ Bandwidth
It is not practicable to reach this limit with every pulse-forming technique, however. For instance, in
the case of Q-switching, minimum achievable pulse width is of the order of 10 ns or so because of the
required pulse build-up time. Cavity dumping overcomes this shortcoming to some extent and pulse
widths of the order of 1–2 ns are achievable; this is still nowhere close to what is theoretically achievable
for a given solid-state laser. For instance, the frequency bandwidth of an Nd:YAG is 150 GHz for a
homogeneously broadened line. For a Gaussian pulse, the minimum achievable pulse width would be
(0.441/150) ns  3 ps. Mode locking helps achieve pulse widths approaching the theoretical limit.
In the absence of special measures, a laser usually oscillates at several transverse modes and typically
hundreds of longitudinal modes. The number of oscillating longitudinal modes depends upon the inter-
mode spacing and gain bandwidth of the transition line. Each mode oscillates independent of the others

Solid-state Lasers
73

and their phases are randomly distributed within the range of p to þp radians. As a result of
oscillations at a large number of longitudinal modes and various modes having random amplitude and
phase relationship, the laser output is a time-averaged statistical mean value and is observed to ﬂuctuate
in amplitude with respect to time as shown in Figure 3.6. The process of mode locking forces different
longitudinal modes to oscillate with a ﬁxed phase relationship with respect to each other, which produces
an ultra-short pulse with well-deﬁned amplitude as a function of time. Figure 3.7 shows a mode-locked
pulse generated from phase locking of different longitudinal modes. In the case of an ideal mode-locked
laser pulse, the intensities of different longitudinal modes follow a Gaussian distribution and the spectral
phases are identically zero as shown in Figure 3.7a and b. Figure 3.7c shows the ideal mode-locked pulse
in the time domain, which is a single Gaussian pulse.
Phase locking is achieved by introducing into the resonator cavity a suitable non-linear element such
as a saturable absorber or an externally driven optical modulator. While the former is referred to as the
Figure 3.6
CW laser output in the absence of mode locking.
Figure 3.7

74
Lasers and Optoelectronics

process of passive mode locking, the latter is called active mode locking. The phenomenon of mode
locking is a process that locks together a cluster of photons in phase. The mode-locking element
transmits this cluster every time it passes through it while bouncing back and forth between the cavity
mirrors. The repetition rate of the mode-locked pulses is equal to the round-trip transit time of the
resonator cavity. That is,
PRF ¼ 1
DT ¼ c
2L
(3.5)
It is also possible to combine the processes of Q-switching and mode locking or the processes of cavity
dumping and mode locking. Q-switching and mode locking can be achieved simultaneously by
introducing Q-switching elements into the cavity in addition to the mode-locking element. The output
in this case has the pulse envelope of a Q-switched pulse, comprising individual short pulses obtained
from mode-locking process as shown in Figure 3.8.
Example 3.1
A certain laser has a bandwidth of 22 GHz. Determine the theoretically possible shortest mode-locked
pulse width it can generate.
Solution
1. Bandwidth ¼ 22 GHz ¼ 22  109 Hz.
2. Shortest possible pulse width according to the transform limit ¼ 0.441/bandwidth ¼ 0.441/(22 
109) ¼ (441  1012)/22 s ¼ 20 ps.
Example 3.2
What would be the repetition rate of the mode-locked pulses in Example 3.1 if the laser cavity is 0.6 m
long?
Solution
1. Repetition rate of mode-locked pulses ¼ c/2L.
2. L ¼ 0.6 m and c ¼ 3  108 m s1.
3. Therefore, repetition rate ¼ (3  108/1.2) Hz ¼ 250 MHz.

Example 3.3
The round-trip time of the laser cavity in a certain solid-state laser is 2 ns. What should be the
approximate value of Q-switched pulse width at the output if the output coupling mirror had 10%
reﬂectivity? How would the pulse width change if the reﬂectivity of the coupling mirror is changed to
20%?
Solution
1. Q-switched pulse width ¼ round-trip time/(1  R) ¼ 2/(1  0.1) ns ¼ 2/0.9 ns ¼ 2.22 ns.
2. For R ¼ 20%, pulse width ¼ 2/(1  0.2) ns ¼ 2/0.8 ns ¼ 2.5 ns.
3.4
Ruby Lasers
The active medium of a ruby laser is sapphire, that is, aluminium oxide (Al2O3) doped with 0.01–0.5%
chromium. The doping process replaces the small percentage of Alþ3 by Crþ3 by adding small amounts
of Cr2O3 to the melt of highly puriﬁed Al2O3. Figure 3.9 shows the energy level diagram of a ruby laser.
As can be seen from the ﬁgure, it has two pump absorption bands centred around 400 nm (blue band) and
550 nm (green band), both having a lifetime of 100 ns. There are two closely spaced metastable levels
with a lifetime of 3 ms from where they drop to the ground state. The ground state here acts as the lower
laser level. The laser emits at 694.3 nm (R1 line). Another possible emission line is at 692.9 nm (R2 line)
but the former is the predominant emission line. The three-level energy structure of ruby is the reason for
its poor efﬁciency (0.1–1%). Laser-related properties of ruby are outlined in Table 3.1.
Figure 3.9
Energy level diagram of ruby laser.
76
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Its properties rapidly degrade with increasing temperature, with the result that ruby lasers are operated
as pulsed lasers at relatively lower repetition rates. The fact that ruby lasers are three-level lasers means
that it cannot be operated as a CW laser. Figure 3.10 depicts the Sinon Q-switched ruby laser system from
Quantel-Derma Gmbh. Major performance speciﬁcations include wavelength 694 nm, pulse width in Q-
switched mode 20 ns, pulse width in long pulse mode 4 ms, pulse repetition rate 0.5–2.0 Hz and an
adjustable beam diameter of 3–6 mm. The system is primarily applied in dermatology and intended for
the removal of pigmentation and tattoos.

Neodymium-doped Lasers
Neodymium-doped solid-state lasers are the most widely used type of laser in general (not just solid-state
laser). Neodymium-doped lasers differ in terms of the host structure that is doped with neodymium.
YAG, YLF (YLiF4) and yttrium-doped vanadate (YVO4) are the most commonly used crystalline hosts
while silicate, phosphate and fused silica are the popular glass hosts. Figure 3.11 shows the energy level
diagram of a Nd:YAG laser. All neodymium-doped lasers, whether crystalline-host based or glass-host
based have an energy level diagram similar in structure to that shown in Figure 3.11. The interaction of
neodymium with the host may lead to a slight change in the output wavelength by around 1% from one
neodymium-doped laser to another. For instance, Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF, Nd:YVO4, Nd:Glass (silicate), Nd:
Glass (phosphate) and Nd:Glass (fused silica) have wavelengths of 1064 nm, 1047–1053 nm, 1064 nm,
1062 nm, 1054 nm and 1080 nm respectively.
While Nd:YAG is mainly known for its high gain and good thermal and mechanical properties,
Nd:Glass is capable of being grown in large sizes with diffraction limited optical quality. As a result,
Nd:YAG is the laser of choice in a wide range of applications requiring either CW or high repetition rate
pulsed operation. Due to the poorer thermal conductivity of Nd:Glass lasers they can only be operated as
pulsed lasers, and at very low repetition rates. The minimum achievable mode-locked pulse width in a
given laser is given by the empirical formula:
t ¼ 0:44

3.5.1
Nd:YAG Lasers
Among the neodymium-doped lasers, Nd:YAG is the most important and most widely used solid-state
laser because of its high gain and good thermal and mechanical properties. In Nd:YAG, trivalent
neodymium replaces trivalent yttrium. Some of its noteworthy properties include hardness, stability of
structure from very low temperatures to up to the melting point, good optical quality and high thermal
conductivity of the YAG host. In addition, the cubic structure of the YAG host favours a narrow line width
leading to high gain and low lasing threshold. Nd:YAG has absorption peaks around 540 nm, 590 nm,
750 nm and 810 nm. Pump bands around 540 nm and 590 nm are relevant for ﬂash lamp pumping as they
emit a large amount of radiation in the visible region; 750 nm and 810 nm for pumping by CWarc lamps;
and 810 nm diode-pumped Nd:YAG lasers. The output laser wavelength is 1064 nm. Major laser-related
properties of Nd:YAG are listed in Table 3.2.
Due to its good thermal and optical properties, Nd:YAG lasers can be used both in CWas well as high
repetition rate Q-switched pulsed mode. Average and peak powers in excess of 1 kW and 100 MW,
respectively, can be achieved in these lasers. Figure 3.12 depicts an arc-lamp-pumped CW Nd:YAG laser
of the LCY-series from Litron Lasers UK, intended for a range of industrial applications such as laser
marking, engraving, hole drilling, micromachining and materials processing. The series offers pure CW
and Q-switched pulsed CW outputs. Multimode power output up to 90 W and TEM00 output up to 18 W
are available in different models. Figure 3.13 is a photograph of the LDY-series laser from Litron Lasers
UK. This is a diode-pumped Nd:YAG laser producing Q-switched CW multimode output power in the
range of 10–90 W in multimode and 3–20 W in TEM00 mode in different models. Repetition rate is in the
range of 1–100 kHz.
High repetition rate (up to 20 Hz) Q-switched (5–20 ns pulse width) Nd:YAG lasers ﬁnd extensive use
in a variety of battleﬁeld applications such as range ﬁnding and target designation. Figure 3.14 depicts a
portable lightweight laser target designator model AN/PEQ-17 from Elbit Systems, typically used for
LGB (laser-guided bomb) delivery applications. The laser produces 1064 nm wavelength, 50–70 mJ/
pulse Q-switched laser pulses of output beam divergence 0.3 mrad. The system operates on pulse
repetition frequencies of NATO Stanag band I/II and offers a designation range of 5 km.
3.5.2
Nd:YLF Lasers
The advantages of Nd:YLF lasers include fewer heat-related problems due to a smaller change in its
refractive index with temperature and higher energy storage capability leading to its ability to generate
higher-energy Q-switched pulses. The ﬂuorescence lifetime is in fact twice as long as in the case of
Nd:YAG. In addition, Nd:YLF crystal is birefringent, which allows generation of two output wave-
lengths at 1047 nm and 1053 nm, each with its own polarization orientation. Figure 3.15 shows the
simpliﬁed energy level diagram of a Nd:YLF laser. Depending upon the polarization, two lines are
possible around both 1.05 and 1.3 mm. Both emissions (1.05 and 1.3 mm) originate from the same
metastable upper laser level as shown in Figure 3.15. Nd:YLF is predominantly used to produce either of

lines at 1053 nm (ordinary) or 1047 nm (extraordinary). Laser-related properties of an Nd:YLF laser are
listed in Table 3.3.
Emission at 1053 nm matches the peak gain of neodymium-doped phosphate and ﬂuorophosphate
glasses. This interesting coincidence makes it highly suitable as an oscillator for pumping Nd:Glass-
based laser ampliﬁer chains used to generate the very high peak power Q-switched pulses needed for
fusion research.

wavelength is 527 nm and typical applications include particle imaging velocimetry (PIV), particle
sizing and pumping of Ti-Sapphire lasers.
3.5.3
Nd:YVO4 Lasers
Neodymium-doped yttrium vanadate is important as a laser material because of several properties that
make it particularly attractive for laser diode pumping. These include a large stimulated emission cross-
section and a strong broadband absorption around 808 nm. The high gain of Nd:YVO4 coupled with
strong absorption of laser diode pump radiation around 808 nm obviate the need for a large crystal size,
which was a serious problem in the early stages of development of this material. Yet another signiﬁcant
characteristic of this laser material is its natural birefringence. The laser output is linearly polarized in the
extraordinary direction and the absorption coefﬁcient for the laser diode pump radiation polarized in the
same direction is much larger (about four times) in Nd:YVO4 than in the case of Nd:YAG.
Some of the disadvantages of Nd:YVO4 as a laser material include a shorter ﬂuorescence lifetime and
a slightly poorer thermal conductivity when compared to Nd:YAG. In fact, a higher stimulated emission
cross-section, which contributes in making it a low lasing threshold material, is partially offset by a
shorter ﬂuorescence lifetime. It may be mentioned here that the lasing threshold depends upon the
product of ﬂuorescence lifetime and the stimulated emission cross-section. Nd:YVO4 is particularly
attractive for laser diode end-pumped CW lasers. These lasers are quite often internally frequency
doubled to produce 532 nm (green) output. The properties of a Nd:YVO4 laser are listed in Table 3.4.
Figure 3.17 depicts an end-pumped CW Nd:YVO4 laser conﬁguration with an intra-cavity non-linear
optical element to produce frequency-doubled output. Figure 3.18 depicts a compact Nd:YVO4 Q-
switched laser module from Alphalas, Germany. The module produces 1-ns-wide 1.5 mJ pulses at a
repetition rate 0–100 Hz. Other features include TEM00 beam proﬁle, >100:1 polarization ratio and
beam diameter of 0.3 mm.
3.5.4
Nd:Cr:GSGG Lasers
Nd:Cr:GSGG is primarily important as laser material for the reason that its absorption band has a better
spectral match to the emission from ﬂash lamps than Nd:YAG; Nd:Cr:GSGG lasers therefore offer
signiﬁcantly higher electrical input to laser output efﬁciency as compared to Nd:YAG. In the case of

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Nd:Cr:GSGG, the pump energy is absorbed by the broad absorption bands of chromium, which is further
transferred non-radiatively to neodymium atoms. This concept was initially tested in a YAG host but was
unsuccessful due to the inefﬁcient energy transfer process. Inefﬁciency was primarily due to a
prohibitively large transfer time of about 6 ms, which should be shorter than the ﬂuorescence decay
time of 0.23 ms. The problem was overcome by using GSGG as the host material, yielding a transfer time
of 17 ms.
The higher efﬁciency of Nd:Cr:GSGG lasers does not necessarily mean that they are better laser
systems than Nd:YAG and solid-state lasers. Nd:Cr:GSGG not only has a signiﬁcantly poorer thermal
conductivity than Nd:YAG, but the additional absorption bands of chromium in blue and red regions that
lead to higher pump efﬁciency produce a signiﬁcant quantum defect heating due to the large difference in
pump photon and laser photon energies. This phenomenon leads to a more severe thermal lensing and
thermally induced birefringence.

3.5.5
Nd:Glass Lasers
Nd:Glass is the other important neodymium-doped solid-state laser. While Nd:YAG is mainly known for
its high gain and good thermal and mechanical properties, Nd:Glass is capable of being grown in large
sizes (rod sizes of 5–6 cm diameter and 100 cm length are not uncommon) with diffraction-limited
optical quality. Nd:Glass laser is the preferred laser for high-energy and high-peak-power applications
requiring either single pulse or low repetition rate operation, such as in laser fusion research. Glass lasers
also have a broad line width, which makes them more adaptable to mode-locking phenomenon in order to
generate much shorter pulse widths of the order of picoseconds. Minimum pulse width that can be
achieved with mode locking in this case is of the order of a few tens of femtoseconds.
The host materials for Nd:Glass lasers are silicate, phosphate and fused silica glasses, with silicate and
phosphate being more common. Silicate and phosphate glasses are based on SiO2 (Silicon dioxide) and
P2O5 (Phosphorus pentoxide) materials, respectively, with the latter being the material of choice due to
its large emission cross-section and lower non-linear coefﬁcient.
As for other neodymium-doped crystalline lasers, Nd:Glass laser is a four-level laser. Figure 3.19
shows the simpliﬁed energy level diagram of a Nd:Glass laser. As shown in the diagram, the laser
transition is from the lower-lying level of 4F3=2 to a lower-lying level of 4I11=2. The emitted wavelength is
typically 1062 nm in the case of silicate glasses and 1054 nm for phosphate glasses.
Figure 3.19
Simpliﬁed energy level diagram of Nd:Glass laser.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

The ﬂuorescent line width in the case of Nd:Glass lasers is insensitive to temperature variations, which
makes it practically feasible to operate these lasers over a wide temperature range (e.g. from 100 C to
þ100 C) with very little change in performance characteristics. Tables 3.5 and 3.6 list the characteristics
of neodymium-doped silicate and phosphate glass lasers, respectively.
3.6
Erbium-doped Lasers
Erbium-doped lasers possess medical and military applications because of the two wavelengths they are
capable of generating when doped in YAG and glass hosts. These wavelengths are 2940 nm (Er:YAG)
and 1540 nm (Er:Glass) and their importance arises from the water absorbent characteristics of these
wavelengths. While 2940 nm holds promise for medical applications in the ﬁeld of plastic surgery due to
its extremely large absorption by water in tissue, 1540 nm is attractive as an eye-safe alternative to
neodymium-doped YAG (or Glass) based military laser rangeﬁnders and laser target designators.
Neodymium lasers with emission around 1064 nm present a serious eye hazard, so eye-safe lasers are
deﬁnitely a much better option for training exercises and war games.
3.6.1
Er:YAG Laser
Figure 3.20 depicts the energy level diagram for Er:YAG, which produces an output wavelength of
2940 nm. The lasing action occurs between an upper laser level with a ﬂuorescence lifetime of 0.1 ms and
a lower laser level with a relatively much larger lifetime of 2 ms. The larger lifetime of the lower level is
in fact a big disadvantage as accumulation of population at the lower level inhibits laser action and also
disallows Q-switching operation. The properties of a Er:YAG laser are listed in Table 3.7. Some of the
other erbium-doped crystalline hosts that have been exploited for laser action include Er:YLF, Er:YAlO3
and Er:Cr:YSGG. These materials produce wavelengths in the range 2710–2920 nm.
3.6.2
Er:Glass Laser
Figure 3.21 shows the energy level diagram of erbium-doped glass, which produces output at 1540 nm.
The three-level behaviour of erbium leads to a low laser efﬁciency. The problem is worsened by the weak
absorption of pump radiation by erbium ions. In order to overcome these shortcomings, ytterbium
(Ybþ3) and chromium (Crþ3) ions are added. Ytterbium acts as a sensitizing agent and helps in absorbing
pump radiation in the wavelength region (0.9–1 mm) where erbium is more or less transparent.

Chromium ions also do a similar job. They help in matching the emission spectrum of ﬂash lamps with
the absorption spectrum of ytterbium: erbium: glass. The properties of erbium-doped glass (phosphate)
are listed in Table 3.8.
Q-switched Er:Glass lasers ﬁnd their main application in eye-safe handheld laser rangeﬁnders. These
are lasers with low repetition rates, typically in the range 5–20 pulses per minute although in some cases
it may be as high as 2 Hz. A large number of manufacturers offer handheld Er:Glass laser rangeﬁnders.

3.7
Vibronic Lasers
What distinguishes a vibronic laser from the more commonly used and better-known neodymium-doped
lasers and ruby lasers is that their energy level structure has a lower lasing level in the form of a band rather
than a single discrete energy level. This energy band results from the interaction of the electronic energy
levels of the active species with the vibrational levels of the crystalline lattice, giving rise to vibrational-
electronic sub-levels. The laser transition occurs between the lowest level of the upper band to anywhere in
the lower band. This characteristic feature of vibronic lasers makes this class of lasers tunable.
These lasers are important not only for the tunability aspect associated with them, but also due to their
ability to generate wavelengths not available from other solid-state laser media. Alexandrite (chromium-
doped BeAl2O4), Cr-GSGG (chromium-doped Gd3Sc2Go3O12) and titanium-sapphire (titanium-doped
Al2O3), with tunability ranges of 700–850 nm, 740–850 nm and 660–1180 nm, respectively, are popular
varieties of vibronic lasers.
3.7.1
Alexandrite Laser
With its intense red output coupled with tenability, the alexandrite laser is a good candidate for
developing a laser dazzler, a device employed for causing temporary dazzling of human eyes.
Alexandrite is the common name for chromium-doped chrysoberyl, with chromium concentration in
the range 0.1–0.4 atomic percent. Alexandrite has optical and mechanical properties similar to that of
ruby. It has many of the physical and chemical properties of a good laser host material, including high
thermal conductivity, hardness, chemical stability and a high thermal fracture limit. The thermal
conductivity and thermal fracture limit of Alexandrite is about twice and ﬁve times that of Nd:YAG,
respectively, which enables Alexandrite to be pumped at high average powers without thermal fracture.
Figure 3.24 depicts the energy level diagram of Alexandrite. Vibronic lasing action occurs between the
upper level 4T2 and any of the excited vibronic states near the ground level 4A2. This characteristic
makes it a tunable laser, and the output wavelength is tunable in the range of 700–850 nm. As shown in
the energy level diagram, there is another energy level at about 800 cm1 below the upper level. This
energy level 2E is in thermal equilibrium with the upper level. 4T2 and 2E levels have lifetimes of 6.6 ms
Figure 3.23

Lasers and Optoelectronics

and 1.54 ms, respectively. The effective ﬂuorescent lifetime of the upper level here is dependent upon the
combined inﬂuence of 4T2 and 2E states, and is approximately 260 ms.
Another interesting property of Alexandrite is the way its performance is inﬂuenced by temperature.
The stimulated emission cross-section, and hence the gain of Alexandrite, increases with increase in
temperature. The gain peak shifts to a longer wavelength due to the population of terminals levels,
particularly those closer to ground level, which decreases the population inversion for lower emission
wavelengths. The net result is that laser performance is positively affected with increasing temperature
for larger wavelengths in the tuning range. The other effect of increase in temperature is reduced
ﬂuorescent lifetime, which decreases from about 260 ms at room temperature to half that at 100 C. The
properties of Alexandrite are listed in Table 3.9. The ability of Alexandrite lasers to sustain high gain at
elevated temperatures, coupled with tenability, make them different from conventional solid-state lasers.

3.7.2
Titanium-sapphire Laser
Titanium-sapphire is the most widely used tunable solid-state laser because of its wide tunability and
good material characteristics. Output wavelength is tunable from 660 nm to 1180 nm with the peak of the
gain curve located around 800 nm. The host material (sapphire) has very high thermal conductivity,
mechanical rigidity and exceptionally high chemical inertness. The concentration of titanium ions in the
laser crystal is about 0.1%. Properties of Ti-sapphire lasers are listed in Table 3.10.
Titanium-sapphire lasers cannot be efﬁciently pumped by ﬂash lamps due to their too-short
ﬂuorescence lifetime. It may be mentioned here that the population inversion required in a laser to
exceed the lasing threshold is inversely proportional to the product of ﬂuorescence lifetime and
stimulated emission cross-section. An extremely small ﬂuorescence lifetime of 3.2 ms in titanium-
sapphire makes this product very small. The consequence is that a very high pump ﬂux would be needed
to achieve the threshold of lasing. The absorption band has a peak at around 500 nm, which makes it
again very difﬁcult to use laser diode pumping as this is too short a wavelength for diode lasers.
In view of the above reasons, titanium-sapphire lasers are usually pumped by frequency-doubled
neodymium lasers (Nd:YAG, Nd:YLF for pulsed output), argon ion lasers (for CW output) and copper
vapour lasers (pulsed output). The neodymium lasers in turn may be diode pumped. The strong emission
of argon ion lasers at 488 nm and 514.5 nm, frequency-doubled YAG lasers at 532 nm, frequency-
doubled YLF lasers at 527 nm and copper vapour lasers at 510 nm match with the absorption band of
titanium-sapphire.
Figure 3.25 depicts the simpliﬁed energy level diagram of a titanium-sapphire laser. Argon ion laser-
pumped Ti-sapphire lasers producing a few watts of CW output, as well as frequency-doubled Nd:YAG
or Nd:YLF laser-pumped Ti-sapphire lasers producing several watts of CW power output or pulsed
output of several millijoules at 1 kHz or in excess of 100 mJ at 20 PPS, are commercially available.
Figure 3.26 depicts a tunable CW Ti-Sapphire laser of the MBR-110 of the MBR ring series from
Coherent Inc. The laser produces >3.5 Wof output power tunable from 700 nm to 1030 nm with an ultra-
low line width of <75 kHz (root mean square or RMS). The laser is ideally suited to atomic and
molecular spectroscopy and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy.
3.8
Colour Centre Lasers
Colour centre lasers are solid-state lasers in which the active medium is a thin crystal doped with some
selected impurities that create microscopic defects in the crystal lattice structure. These microscopic defects
absorb light, thus colouring the otherwise colourless crystal, hence the name colour centres. The
phenomenon of absorption of light by the colour centres is used for pumping the crystal. Although laser
action has been demonstrated in colour centre lasers near 400 nm and in the range 800–4000 nm,
commercially established types operate near 1500 nm and beyond 2000nm. Colour centre lasers are
pumped by another laser such as an ion laser, a dye laser or Nd:YAG laser. These lasers normally operate in
continuous wave mode butcan be synchronously pumped bymode-lockedlaserstoproducea pulsedoutput.
Some of the common active media used in colour centre lasers include lithium-doped potassium
chloride, lithium-doped rubidium chloride, sodium-doped potassium chloride and sodium-doped
rubidium chloride.

A large number of possible vibrational states in the colour centre crystals lead to homogeneous
broadening of the laser transition, which permits tuning of the emission wavelength over a broad
wavelength range. Wavelength tuning by as much as 15–20% of the centre wavelength is possible.
Colour centre lasers operate at liquid nitrogen temperature. A Dewar that maintains operation at 77 K
cools the laser crystal and the pumping chamber. Colour centre lasers ﬁnd application in high-resolution
spectroscopy, where their high spectralpurity isa signiﬁcantadvantage. They operate insingle longitudinal
mode with a line width of the order of 1 MHz; active stabilization could improve this to 10–20 kHz.

Fibre Lasers
Fibre lasers are a type of solid-state laser where the gain medium is a ﬁbre doped with rare earth ions,
rather than a rod or slab. They are an alternative to bulk solid-state lasers and have a wide range of
industrial and military applications requiring high power levels with high beam quality in a compact and

rugged package conﬁguration. Inherent in the ﬁbre laser design and operational regimes are excellent
performance characteristics, which include a high level of immunity to misalignment, high beam quality,
compactness and long-term stability. In addition to these, ﬁbre lasers exhibit outstanding thermo-optical
properties due to their large surface-area-to-volume ratio. Advantages and limitations of ﬁbre lasers are
discussed in detail in the following sections.
The gain medium in the case of ﬁbre lasers is a glass ﬁbre doped with rare earth element ions such as
neodymium (Nd3þ), erbium (Er3þ), ytterbium (Yb3þ), thulium (Tm3þ), holium (Ho3þ) or praseodym-
ium (Pr3þ). Fibre coupled semiconductor laser diodes or ﬁbre lasers are used as the pump source and the
resonator comprises active medium bounded by dielectric mirrors or ﬁbre Bragg gratings. In the
following sections we describe ﬁbre laser operational basics, salient features, operational regimes and
typical applications and compare them to bulk solid-state lasers.
3.9.1
Basic Fibre Laser
In its simplest form, a ﬁbre laser comprises ﬁbre doped with rare earth element ions as the active medium,
a ﬁbre coupled semiconductor diode laser or another ﬁbre laser as the pump source, and dielectric
mirrors or ﬁbre Bragg gratings to form the resonant cavity. Figure 3.27 depicts the simpliﬁed
arrangement of different components of the basic ﬁbre laser. Both the pump and laser radiation are
guided through the waveguide structure constituted by the core and the cladding of the single-clad ﬁbre.
The dielectric mirrors and the single-clad ﬁbre constitute the resonant cavity in the arrangement of
Figure 3.27. In practical ﬁbre lasers, in most cases, ﬁbre Bragg gratings are used instead.
A ﬁbre Bragg grating is a type of distributed Bragg reﬂector constructed in a short segment of ﬁbre as
shown in Figure 3.28a . The grating is created by a periodic variation of the refractive index of the core
and is designed in order to reﬂect a particular wavelength and transmit all other wavelengths as
illustrated in Figure 3.28b. The ﬁbre core doped with rare earth ion guides the light, so the pump radiation
must be spatially coherent.
As the power available from single mode semiconductor diode lasers is usually limited to a few watts,
such a conﬁguration cannot be used to build relatively higher output power lasers. This limitation is
overcome by using a double-clad ﬁbre design. In this case, the active doped core is surrounded by a
second waveguide structure in the form of inner cladding, also known as the pump core. Figure 3.29
depicts the arrangement.
Double-clad ﬁbre laser design allows the use of multimode semiconductor diode lasers as the pump
source. Pump radiation in this case is launched in the inner cladding. The pump radiation is gradually
absorbed over the entire length of the ﬁbre which is converted into single-mode high-brightness laser
radiation by laser action. Unlike bulk solid-state lasers where the intensity is limited to Rayleigh length
by diffraction, in the case of a double-clad ﬁbre laser the intensity is maintained over the entire ﬁbre
length due to conﬁnement of both pump and laser radiation. Consequently, the gain of the active medium
(the product of light intensity in the gain medium and the interaction length) is signiﬁcantly higher than
that in the case of a bulk solid-state laser. This property gives ﬁbre lasers a high single-pass gain and a
low pump threshold value.
Figure 3.27
Basic ﬁbre laser.
92
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Wavelengths emitted by common ﬁbre lasers are in the region of 1.0–1.1 mm from ytterbium-doped
lasers, 1.52–1.57 mm from erbium-doped lasers and 1.9–2.1 mm from thulium- and holmium-doped
lasers. Figure 3.30a–d show simpliﬁed energy level diagrams of ytterbium-, erbium-, thulium- and
holmium-doped active media. Because of a low quantum defect (<10%) ytterbium is the dopant material
of choice, particularly in high-average-power ﬁbre lasers.
One drawback of the double-clad ﬁbre laser concept is reduced absorption of pump radiation by the
active-ion-doped core due to the existence of intensity distributions in the inner cladding that has no
overlap with the active medium. As a result of this, optical-to-optical efﬁciency reduces. This problem is
overcome by breaking the cylindrical symmetry of inner cladding, usually by D-shaped or rectangular
pump core geometries. Periodic bending when used in symmetrical ﬁbres also enhances absorption of
pump radiation.
3.9.2
Fibre Lasers versus Bulk Solid-state Lasers
In the following, we compare ﬁbre lasers with bulk solid-state lasers in terms of their performance
characteristics, applications, strengths and weaknesses.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

1. Fibre lasers exhibit relatively much higher wall-plug efﬁciency compared to bulk solid-state lasers.
Wall-plug efﬁciency approaching 50% is achievable in the case of ﬁbre lasers, as against a ﬁgure of
20–30% for solid-state lasers. However, ﬁbre lasers need to use pump diodes producing a higher
beam quality than the beam quality required in the case of bulk solid-state lasers. Bulk lasers can also
employ pump sources with poor beam quality. As an illustration, an extremely high pulse energy/
peak power pulse of laser with a moderate repetition rate such as that used in laser fusion research
could be built by using a rod laser side-pumped by high-energy ﬂash lamps. This would not be
possible for a ﬁbre laser.
2. Fibre lasers produce a laser with higher beam quality at higher average output power levels as
compared to bulk solid-state lasers. The ﬁbre structure and the associated waveguide effect coupled
with large surface-area-to-volume ratio give ﬁbre lasers excellent thermo-optical properties. As a
result, ﬁbre lasers are able to produce high output power levels with high beam quality. Although both
ﬁbre and bulk solid-state lasers can generate multikilowatt power levels, it is far more difﬁcult in the
case of the latter to achieve the beam quality of the former for a given output power level.
3. Fibre lasers inherently offer relatively higher gain bandwidth. The glass host broadens the optical
transition in rare earth ion dopant. This makes ﬁbre lasers continuously tunable in the near-infrared
spectral region from 1–2 mm by using a suitable dopant from ytterbium, erbium and thulium. Higher
gain bandwidth also allows ﬁbre lasers to generate ultra-short pulses by using passive mode locking,
although sometimes it is not feasible to fully exploit their large gain bandwidth to achieve the shortest
possible pulse width due to excessive non-linearity.
4. Fibre lasers have broad absorption bands with good absorption, which makes the pumping process
less critical in terms of pump wavelength. This further implies that the pump diode lasers could
possibly be used without temperature stabilization.
5. Fibre lasers are signiﬁcantly cheaper than the bulk lasers with comparable performance speciﬁca-
tions. This is more so in the case of all ﬁbre lasers which do not employ any free space optics. One of
the reasons for the low cost of ﬁbre lasers is that processes such as fusion splicing used for integrating
various ﬁbre-based components of the laser can be largely automated. Also, in all ﬁbre lasers the
absence of any free space optics makes them immune to any misalignment and renders robustness
and long-term stability.
6. While ﬁbre lasers offer a far superior performance when it comes to high average power lasers with
high beam quality, bulk solid-state lasers have the edge in high-pulse-energy, high-peak-power
applications.
7. Fibre lasers suffer from excessive Kerr non-linearity arising from the long length and small mode area
of the ﬁbre. Non-linearity often limits the shortest achievable pulse width and single-frequency
operation of the laser. Non-linear effects are much less severe in the case of bulk solid-state lasers.
8. Fibre lasers can be operated on difﬁcult laser transitions. This is made possible by the waveguide
structure of the ﬁbre laser, which allows high pump radiation intensities to be applied over long ﬁbre
lengths. Up-conversion lasers is an example of this.
3.9.3
Operational Regimes
Common operational regimes of a ﬁbre laser include CW, Q-switched and mode-locked modes of
operation. The continuous wave ﬁbre laser mode of operation, with output power levels extending from
milliwatts to kilowatts, is the most sought-after variety with a wide range of industrial and military
applications. The Q-switched mode of operation can be used to generate pulse energies in the range of
several millijoules to several tens of millijoules with pulse widths in the range of several tens of
nanoseconds to hundreds of nanoseconds. The mode-locked regime is used to generate ultra-short pulses
with pulse widths of the order of tens to hundreds of femtoseconds. Both active as well as passive mode
locking is possible. Another operational regime that is attractive in the case of ﬁbre lasers is the up-
conversion mode of operation, in which lasing action is achieved in difﬁcult-to-operate lasing transitions.
Single-frequency low-gain operation is also possible in ﬁbre lasers by using a short-length resonator
with narrow-bandwidth ﬁbre Bragg gratings as reﬂectors on the two ends. These single-frequency ﬁbre
Solid-state Lasers
95

lasers can be used to generate CW power levels of a few milliwatts to a few tens of milliwatts; a power
level approaching 1 W has also been achieved. Single-frequency operation is also possible using the
distributed feedback (DFB) laser concept. In a DFB laser, a single-ﬁbre Bragg grating with a phase shift
in the middle is used.
In the distributed Bragg reﬂector (DBR) based single-frequency laser design, depicted in Figure 3.31,
a short cavity length of the order of a few centimetres is used between two narrow bandwidth ﬁbre Bragg
gratings with a spectral line width of a fraction of a nanometre. Short cavity length ensures a longer
separation between adjacent longitudinal modes, forcing only a single longitudinal mode to propagate.
The shorter spectral line width of ﬁbre Bragg grating reﬂectors ensures that only a single longitudinal
mode experiences gain above lasing threshold.
InthecaseofDFBlaserdesign,depictedinFigure3.32,alongerﬁbreBragggrating(FBG)withap/2phase
jump is used to construct the resonator. Due to its precise phase control over the long FBG, DFB operational
mode combined with p/2 phase jump gives a much lower spectral line width and single-frequency operation.
3.9.4
Photonic Crystal Fibre Lasers
In comparison to the conventional step-index ﬁbre that derives its wave-guiding properties from a
spatially varying glass composition, the basic photonic crystal ﬁbre (PCF) is an optical ﬁbre with a
structured pattern of air holes (also called voids) that run parallel to the axis all along its length
(Figure 3.33). Unlike conventional ﬁbres, core and cladding are made from the same material in the case
of PCF. Most PCFs are made from pure fused silica, which is highly compatible with PCF fabrication

techniques, although PCFs have also been made of other materials such as heavy metal soft glasses and
polymers. One of the methods of fabrication of PCFs, known as stacked tube technique, involves using a
preform with larger holes made by stacking capillary and/or solid tubes and inserting them into a larger
tube. The preform is ﬁrst drawn to a diameter of approximately 1 mm, which is subsequently further
drawn to a ﬁbre of ﬁnal diameter of the order of 100 mm.
The most common type of PCF has a hexagonal array of air holes with one or more missing holes in
the centre forming the core (Figure 3.34). The region with the missing hole has a higher refractive index,
analogous to the core of a conventional step-index ﬁbre.
3.9.4.1
Guiding Mechanisms in PCF
There are two distinct mechanisms of guiding light in PCFs: photonic band-gap guiding and index
guiding. In the case of the photonic band-gap guiding mechanism, the wavelengths falling within the
band gap of the photonic crystal cannot propagate out and are therefore conﬁned to the core. The index
guiding mechanism is similar to conventional step-index ﬁbre operation.
A typical index-guided PCF has a solid core and a structured pattern of air holes surrounding the core.
The presence of air holes reduces the refractive index. In comparison to a conventional step-index ﬁbre,
an index-guided PCF structure offers much ﬁner and more accurate control over the magnitude of the
refractive index. The guiding mechanism is due to total internal reﬂection.
3.9.4.2
Subclasses of PCFs
The properties of ﬁbre in both index- and band-gap-guided PCFs can be varied by controlling parameters
such as the size, shape and arrangement of air holes. These parameters can be suitably manipulated to
obtain an optimum performance for a speciﬁc application. Many subclasses of PCFs are available,
supporting a wide range of applications. Some of these types include large numerical aperture (NA),
large mode area, highly non-linear, low index core and air-guiding hollow core PCFs.
One of the subclasses of PCFs known as endlessly single mode is characterized by a triangular
matrix of circular holes with one or more (3, 5 or 7) missing holes. Analysis of this structure shows
Figure 3.34
Basic photonic crystal ﬁbre.
Solid-state Lasers
97

that the ﬁbre supports a single mode for ratio of hole diameter to spacing greater than a certain
value, regardless of operating wavelength for core diameter, approaching tens of microns. In other
words, this PCF offers a single-mode operation for large mode areas over a wide wavelength range
in sharp contrast to conventional step-index ﬁbre, which offers a single-mode operation for
relatively much smaller core diameter over a narrow wavelength range. Single-mode operation
over a large mode area reduces power density, thus minimizing non-linear effects and allowing
operation at high power levels.
Large NA ﬁbre is another subcategory of PCF. An increased volume of air holes lowers the refractive
index of the cladding with the resulting ﬁbre having a large NA; NA approaching 0.7 is practical. Large
NA coupled with large mode area allows highly efﬁcient coupling of light from an extended source such
as high-power laser diodes.
Highly non-linear ﬁbres are constructed by having a small core of approximately 1.0 mm surrounded
by a honeycomb array of large air spaces to achieve a large core to cladding refractive index ratio. Such
ﬁbres are particularly useful, for example in Raman ampliﬁcation, four-wave mixing, super-continuum
generation and optical parametric ampliﬁcation. A common type of photonic band-gap ﬁbre consists of a
hollow core surrounded by closely packed triangular matrix of circular holes. Depending upon structure,
these ﬁbres offer a limited spectral bandwidth of the order of 10–20% of nominal transmission
wavelength. Fibres with transmission wavelength centred around 800 nm, 1064 nm and 1550 nm are
commercially available.
3.9.4.3
PCF Lasers
Conventional high-power ﬁbre lasers use double-clad step-index ﬁbres with a polymer outer cladding
and a core doped with rare earth ions such as ytterbium or erbium. This conﬁguration has an upper limit
to achievable pump and output power levels while maintaining a single-mode output. This is due to the
fact that operation at single transverse mode necessitates use of small core size of the order of a few
microns, resulting in higher power densities at high pump and output power levels. High power density
leads to further detrimental non-linear effects, although these effects can be minimized to an extent by
increasing the core size while still maintaining a single-mode output. The techniques used include
controlling index and initial excitation proﬁles, and introducing microbending losses to preferentially
inhibit propagation of higher-order modes.
Dual-clad ﬁbre laser architecture based on PCF technology provides a good alternative to scale the
output power to higher levels. In the double-clad PCFs (Figure 3.35), the pump cladding is surrounded by
an air cladding region. Due to a large refractive index contrast the pump cladding has a very high NA,
typically in the range 0.6–0.7. Large NA signiﬁcantly lowers the pump source requirements with respect
to beam quality and brightness, and permits efﬁcient pumping with relatively lower-cost large-emitting-
area pump diodes. Within the inner cladding is another microstructured rare-earth-doped core. The
single-mode core can be expanded to a large-mode area to facilitate operation at higher power levels with
single-mode output. With such PCF designs, problems due to non-linearities are substantially reduced
and there is a good overlap between the pump mode and laser mode.
3.9.5
Applications
High-power ﬁbre lasers with average power levels in the range of tens of watts to multikilowatt levels are
important in a wide range of industrial and military applications. Figure 3.36 depicts a CW ﬁbre laser
from SPI lasers, UK. The R4 series lasers produce output at 1070  10 nm and are capable of generating
both CWand modulated output power up to 500 W. The lasers are intended for a wide range of industrial
applications which includes cutting, welding, bending, bonding, sintering, annealing and surface
texturing. Until the 1990s, the telecommunications industry was the largest consumer of ﬁbre lasers.
Fibre laser growth, in particular the high-power ﬁbre laser, has beneﬁted immensely from technological
developments during the days of telecommunications industry expansion. Many of the components
including the single-emitter ﬁbre coupled pump diodes used in high-power ﬁbre lasers today were
developed during the 1980s and 1990s.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Salient features of ﬁbre lasers and the advantages they offer compared to bulk solid-state lasers were
discussed in Section 3.9. In the case of ﬁbre lasers, power scalability while retaining the beam quality has
been the key factor in their increasing popularity and acceptance over carbon dioxide and bulk solid-state
lasers used earlier in the majority of industrial and military applications. While the highest achieved
power level in the case of carbon dioxide and Nd:YAG lasers saturated after the year 2000, ﬁbre lasers
continue to evolve with a single-mode ﬁbre laser achieving 10 kW of power level and broadband
multimode ﬁbre lasers scaled up to a power level of 50 kW. Figure 3.37 shows the power levels achieved

in Nd:YAG, CO2 and ﬁbre lasers over the last six decades. The power level is continuing to grow for ﬁbre
lasers.
High-power pulsed and CW ﬁbre lasers are fast replacing CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers for a wide range of
industrial applications in automotive, aerospace and medical industries, where they are mostly used for
cutting, welding and cladding operations. Single-mode ﬁbre lasers with moderate power levels in the
range of tens to hundreds of watts are ideally suited to microwelding applications and for cutting thin
materials. Fibre lasers with average power levels of a few hundred watts and peak power levels of a few
kilowatts are very attractive for a host of industrial applications including cutting, welding, marking,
engraving, sintering and soldering. These operations are discussed in detail in Chapter 11 on industrial
applications of lasers.
Single-mode and low-order multimode ﬁbre lasers with power levels of 1 kWor more have found wide
acceptance in a range of materials processing applications due to their more reliable and consistent
performance, low operating and maintenance costs and faster rate of materials processing. Fibre lasers
are preferred by companies as a retroﬁt as the resulting increase in production is found to offset the
additional costs involved in replacing existing CO2 or Nd:YAG lasers.
Another major application of high-power ﬁbre lasers is in directed-energy weapon applications in
defence. High power at high beam quality, compactness, ruggedness, reliability and ﬁbre delivery are the
key features that give them an edge over chemical lasers and bulk solid-state lasers for military
applications. Fibre lasers have already been used in a number of directed-energy weapon technology
demonstrators for a range of applications including counter explosive devices, counter RAM (rocket
artillery mortar) and counter UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) applications. Directed-energy laser
weapons for ballistic missile defence and anti-satellite applications have not been ruled out for the
future. Military applications of lasers are described at length in Chapters 14 and 15.

Summary
 Based on the type of lasing medium used, the three major categories of lasers are solid-state lasers (this
chapter), gas lasers (Chapter 4) and semiconductor lasers (Chapter 5). In addition, there are a large
number of other varieties of laser such as dye lasers, excimer lasers, metal vapour lasers, free electron
lasers, x-ray lasers and chemical lasers.
 Solid-state lasers are almost invariably optically pumped; gas lasers are excited by an electrical
discharge while semiconductor lasers are pumped by an electrical current ﬂowing through a forward-
biased diode junction.
 Neodymium and chromium are the most widely used lasing species in solid-state lasers. While
chromium is used in ruby, alexandrite and chromium-doped GSGG lasers, neodymium is used in Nd:
YAG, Nd:Glass, Nd:YLF and Nd:YVO4 lasers. Erbium is the lasing species for the eye-safe class of
solid-state lasers. Titanium is used in titanium-sapphire lasers.
 In the case of solid-state lasers (although this is also true for any other laser), the characteristics of the
host material are no less important than those of the lasing species. A good host material in the case of
solid-state lasers should have optical, mechanical and thermal properties to favour the homogeneous
propagation of light through it and thus a good beam quality, high average power operation and the
ability to withstand severe operating conditions of practical laser systems. Hosts can either be of
crystalline format (e.g. YAG, YLF, GGG, GSGG, YVO4, sapphire and chrysoberyl) or glass (e.g.
silicate and phosphate).
 Lasers can also be deﬁned in terms of operation mode: CW output; free-running output, Q-switched
output, cavity-dumped output and mode-locked output.
 In the case of CWoutput, the laser produces a continuous output as long as it is pumped. Free-running
output is a quasi-CW mode of operation in which the laser operates in CW mode for a time period
equal to or slightly longer than the storage time of the active medium, which in turn is of the same
order as the pump input pulse length.
 Q-switching is a mechanism of producing short laser pulses of the order of a few nanoseconds,
achieved by switching the quality factor of the resonator cavity from a low to a high value at the time
instant when the population inversion density almost reaches its peak value.
 Cavity-dumping is a slight variation of the Q-switching process, where output pulse width is
independent of the gain characteristics of the active medium and equals round-trip cavity transit
time.
 Mode locking helps to achieve short pulse widths approaching the theoretical limit set by the
bandwidth. The process forces different longitudinal modes to oscillate with a ﬁxed phase relationship
with respect to each other.
 In the case of common solid-state lasers, output wavelength is: 694.3 nm (R1 line) and 692.9 nm (R2
line) for ruby laser; 1064 nm for Nd:YAG and YVO4 lasers; 1053 nm (ordinary) and 1047 nm
(extraordinary) for Nd:YLF laser; 2940 nm for Er:YAG laser; 1540 nm for Er:Glass laser; 700–
850 nm for Alexandrite laser; and 680–1180 nm for titanium-sapphire laser.
 A ﬁbre laser is a type of solid-state laser where the gain medium is ﬁbre doped with rare earth ions,
rather than a rod or slab. Inherent in the ﬁbre laser design and operational regimes are excellent
performance characteristics which include a high level of immunity to misalignment, high beam
quality, compactness and long-term stability. In addition to these, ﬁbre lasers exhibit outstanding
thermo-optical properties as a result of large surface-area-to-volume ratio.
 In its simplest form, a ﬁbre laser comprises of ﬁbre doped with rare earth element ions as the active
medium, a ﬁbre coupled semiconductor diode laser or another ﬁbre laser as the pump source and
dielectric mirrors or ﬁbre Bragg gratings to form the resonant cavity.
 Relative to bulk solid-state lasers, ﬁbre lasers exhibit higher wall-plug efﬁciency, higher beam
quality at higher average output power levels and offer relatively higher gain bandwidth. While
ﬁbre lasers offer far superior performance when it comes to high average power lasers with high
beam quality, bulk solid-state lasers have the edge in high pulse energy, high peak power
applications.

 In comparison to the conventional step-index ﬁbre that derives its wave-guiding properties from a
spatially varying glass composition, the basic PCF is an optical ﬁbre having a structured pattern of air
holes or voids that run parallel to the axis all along its length.

Gas Lasers
4.1
Introduction to Gas Lasers
In a continuation of our discussion on types of lasers, this chapter is on gas lasers. Gas lasers covered in
this chapter include helium-neon lasers, carbon dioxide lasers, metal vapour lasers, rare gas ion lasers,
excimer lasers, chemical lasers and gas dynamic carbon dioxide lasers. Dye lasers, free-electron lasers
and x-ray lasers are also covered towards the end of the chapter as these do not ﬁt either of the three main
categories (solid-state, gas and semiconductor diode lasers). However, a separate chapter on these three
types of laser would have not been justiﬁed. Again, the emphasis is on operational fundamentals, salient
features and typical applications of these lasers.
The family of gas lasers, solid-state and semiconductor diode lasers, has widely varying character-
istics including the wavelength range, power levels and to some extent even the pumping mechanism.
The available output powers from gas lasers vary from a fraction of a milliwatt in a small helium-neon
laser used for optical alignment to a megawatt level in a gigantic high-power chemical laser used as a
weapon. The wavelength range also spans almost the entire optical spectrum from ultraviolet to far-
infrared with thousands of laser wavelengths discovered throughout the region. Another signiﬁcant
feature that is all gas lasers have Doppler-broadened gain versus frequency curve. The practical
implication of this is that it allows more than one longitudinal mode to oscillate simultaneously in
the laser cavity, unless special measures are taken for mode selection. As an illustration, a helium-neon
laser emitting at 632.8 nm has a Doppler-broadened gain curve with FWHM (full width at half
maximum) of 1400 MHz. One longitudinal mode in this case typically has 1 MHz bandwidth with
the result that the gain curve may accommodate three longitudinal modes assuming a 500 MHz inter-
mode spacing, which is the case for a 30-cm-long laser cavity. Doppler broadening occurs in gas lasers
due to the random motion of atoms. Such a broadening mechanism is however absent from solid-state
and semiconductor diode lasers, as the atoms are ﬁxed in these lasers.
4.1.1
The Active Media
The active medium in the case of a gas laser is almost invariably a mixture of more than one gas, with
gases other than the actual lasing species performing certain subtle functions such as: acting as an
intermediate step during transfer of energy from pump source to lasing species (helium in helium-neon
lasers and nitrogen in carbon dioxide lasers); assisting in heat transfer (helium in carbon dioxide lasers)
and depopulating the lower lasing level (helium in helium-neon laser).
The gas mixture is contained in a tube and held at a pressure that again depends upon a number of
parameters. Low pressure of the order of a small fraction of atmospheric pressure, which is suitable for
stable discharge for longer periods, is mostly utilized in continuous wave (CW) lasers. In the case of
pulsed lasers, where the discharge stability is required for a shorter period, the laser gas mixture could be

 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published 2013 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

ﬁlled at a pressure close to atmospheric pressure and sometimes at >1 atm. The optimum gas pressure for
lasers of a given type also depends upon the laser design.
The active media of different gas lasers may not be in the same form. For example, in the case of
argon-ion and krypton-ion lasers, the active medium is the ionized atoms of the rare gases argon and
krypton, respectively. In the case of metal vapour lasers such as copper vapour and gold vapour lasers, the
active medium is the hot metal vapour. In the helium-cadmium laser, the metal vapour is also ionized.
4.1.2
Inter-level Transitions
In the case of most gas lasers, inter-level transitions are electronic except for carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers,
hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) lasers, deuterium ﬂuoride (DF) lasers and carbon monoxide (CO) lasers that
involve vibrational transitions. Some far-infrared lasers producing wavelengths greater than 30 mm have
vibrational or rotational transitions. Table 4.1 lists some of the popular gas lasers along with the type of
transition, corresponding wavelength, mode of operation (pulsed or CW) and typical power level range.
4.1.3
Pumping Mechanism
Most of the gas lasers are excited by electrical discharge as shown in the generalized arrangement of a
gas laser in Figure 4.1. The active medium is usually excited either by passing an electric discharge
current along the length of the tube known as longitudinal excitation (Figure 4.1), or by an electric
discharge perpendicular to the length of the laser tube known as transverse excitation (Figure 4.2). The
former is used in relatively low-power CW lasers while the latter is employed in high-power pulsed or
CW lasers.
In the case of CW lasers, a high DC voltage is initially required to ionize the gas. Once the ionization
has taken place, the DC voltage is brought to a much lower value needed to sustain the plasma. In the case
of a pulsed laser, a large capacitor is charged to the required DC voltage and then made to discharge
through the laser medium.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Some gas lasers such as those generating far-infrared wavelengths are optically pumped. Another gas
laser of shorter wavelength usually pumps these lasers. A CO2 laser may be used to pump such a laser.
We brieﬂy describe the two most commonly used gas lasers in Sections 4.2 and 4.3: helium-neon
(He-Ne) and CO2 lasers. Sections 4.4–4.8 are dedicated to the discussion of other varieties of gas lasers
which are important although less common, and Section 4.9 provides information on dye, free-electron and
x-ray lasers, which do not belong to any of the three main types of laser (solid-state, gas or semiconductor).

with the red beam from a He-Ne laser at 632.8nm, lasing action is also possible at the infrared wavelengths
of 1.153 mm and 3.391 mm and the visible wavelength of 543.5 nm. In fact, ﬁrst successful operation of a
CW laser was achieved in a He-Ne laser at 3.391 mm by Javan, Benett and Herriott at Bell Labs following
the ﬁrst lasing action demonstrated by Maiman in a ruby laser. Incidentally, He-Ne lasers are usually
identiﬁed by red output; the lasing transition in He-Ne that that has the highest gain is at 3.391mm.
Figure 4.3 depicts the energy level structure of a He-Ne laser. The active medium is the laser gas
mixture of helium and neon, which is predominantly helium with only 10–20% neon. The gas mixture is
excited by an electrical discharge. Initially, a high voltage of the order of 10 kV ionizes the gas mixture.
The voltage is then brought down to about 2 kV or so, which is sufﬁcient to sustain the discharge by
supplying a few milli-amperes of current. The free electrons in the plasma excite helium atoms to higher
energy levels. The excited helium atoms then transfer their energy to neon atoms, which have energy
levels (4s and 5s levels of neon) coincident with excited helium levels (2s levels of helium) as shown in
the ﬁgure. The transfer of energy is through a collisional process. The 4s and 5s levels of neon are
metastable levels having a relatively much larger lifetime, which facilitates laser action. The metastable
lifetime here is of the order 1 ms and the laser action takes place between metastable levels (4s or 5s of
neon) and the lower lasing levels (3p or 4p of neon). These combinations of numerals and letters (s, p, d,

etc.) are spectroscopic notations indicating electronic energy levels. In ascending order of energy
quantum, these energy levels are designated 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p, 5s, etc.
A helium-neon laser has a low gain; cavity losses therefore need to be very low to make the laser action
possible. Efﬁciency is also very low in the range of 0.01–0.1% due to the involved lasing levels being far
above the ground state, as is clear from the energy level diagram of Figure 4.3.
A helium-neon laser has a Doppler-broadened gain curve which is about 1400 MHz at 632.8 nm
(Figure 4.4); recall that Doppler broadening is proportional to frequency. Superimposed on the Doppler-
broadened gain curve is the cavity resonance function with inter-longitudinal mode spacing given by
DD ¼ c=2L, L being the length of the cavity. A short cavity, for example 15 cm long, would support only
a single longitudinal mode as shown in Figure 4.4; in that case, the inter-mode spacing would be
1000 MHz. A longer cavity opens up the possibility of more than one longitudinal mode being sustained
simultaneously in the cavity. The uncertainty in frequency of single longitudinal mode would be dictated
by the Doppler-broadened line width due to temperature changes causing cavity length variation. The
same phenomenon causes power ﬂuctuation in the output beam. However, the single longitudinal mode
could be forced to occur at the centre of the gain curve and stay there, irrespective of temperature and
other factors causing cavity length variation, by employing what is known as active means of frequency
stabilization. These are discussed at length in Chapter 8 on gas laser electronics.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Figure 4.5a and b show the constructional features of a typical helium-neon laser. In one of the
geometries (Figure 4.5a), mirrors are directly bonded to the two ends of the tube by a high-temperature
process called hard sealing. This minimizes helium leak, which is vital for the long life of the laser. One
of the disadvantages of direct bonding of laser mirrors is that it exposes the mirror coatings to the
discharge, which could adversely affect the life of the laser. This could however be overcome by using
mirrors with high damage threshold and an improved laser geometry. In another type as shown in
Figure 4.5b, one of the ends of the tube is sealed with a Brewster window which practically eliminates
any reﬂection losses for the plane polarized light. In plane polarized light, the plane of polarization is
parallel to the plane of incidence. The other mirror component, output coupler or the high reﬂectivity
mirror is placed outside the tube in this case, and may or may not be part of the overall housing. This
proposition is more expensive but is deﬁnitely a better option for relatively high-power helium-neon
lasers producing output power in the range of 10–60 mW. It also allows the selection of different
wavelengths. Lower-power lasers invariably employ the former type of construction. Figure 4.6 depicts a
2.5 mW He-Ne laser tube from Melles Griot.
Regarding helium-neon laser tube construction, the mirrors need to have low losses to compensate for
the low gain of the laser. One of the mirrors is 100% reﬂective. The output mirror transmits a small
percentage of irradiance inside the cavity and reﬂects most of it back into the laser cavity. The output
mirror has a transmission of typically 2%. Another notable feature of laser tube construction is that the
electric discharge applied to the ends of the tube is concentrated in a narrow bore of a few millimetres in
diameter. This raises laser excitation efﬁciency and improves beam quality. The rest of the tube volume
acts as a gas reservoir and contains extra helium and neon. Gas pressure within the tube is about 2–3 torr,
which is 0.3–0.4% of atmospheric pressure.
The power output of a helium-neon laser depends upon several parameters, predominantly tube length,
gas pressure and the discharge bore diameter. The ﬁgure-of-merit is deﬁned as the product of gas
pressure (in torr) and bore diameter (in mm), which has an optimum value of 3.5–4. That is, the output
power for a given tube length is highest when the ﬁgure-of-merit equals approximately 3.5 to 4. As an
illustration, helium-neon laser tubes with bore diameter in the range of 1.0–1.5 mm have gas ﬁll pressure
of the order of 3.0–4.0 torr.
He-Ne lasers are available both as sealed-off tubes as well as packaged types. The package types are
also available as lasers with a separate power supply as well as self-contained lasers for original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) applications. Figure 4.7 depicts different types of He-Ne laser including
self-contained lasers (Figure 4.7a) and those available with separate power supplies (Figure 4.7b). He-Ne

lasers are increasingly being replaced by semiconductor diode lasers, particularly in applications where
the high-beam quality of a helium-neon laser is not a necessity.
4.3
Carbon Dioxide Lasers
Carbon dioxide (CO2) lasers are the most widely used and diversely exploited type of gas laser. The CO2
laser has a myriad of applications in industry, medical diagnosis and treatment, science and technology
and warfare.
The laser medium in this case is a gas mixture of carbon dioxide (CO2), helium (He) and nitrogen (N2).
CO2 is the lasing species and laser transitions correspond to the energy levels associated with molecular
vibration and rotation modes of the CO2 molecule. Nitrogen participates in the process of creation
of population inversion by acting as an intermediate step in the same way as helium does in the case of a
He-Ne laser. In the case of a CO2 laser, helium helps in depopulating the lower laser level.
Unlike gas lasers such as He-Ne lasers, the energy levels responsible for laser action in a CO2 laser do
not correspond to excitation and de-excitation of electrons; instead, they correspond to vibrational/rota-
tional levels of CO2 molecule. The CO2 molecule has three types of vibrations which are (in descending
order of energy level): asymmetric stretching, symmetric stretching and bending (Figure 4.8). The free
electrons in the gas-discharge plasma transfer their energy very efﬁciently to N2 molecules, which raise
themselves to an appropriate level coincident with CO2 energy level corresponding to asymmetric
stretching. Figure 4.9 shows the energy level diagram in the case of a CO2 laser. The N2 molecules
transfer the energy to CO2 molecules, which is the upper lasing level. Laser transitions correspond to the
CO2 molecules dropping from higher-energy asymmetric stretching mode to the lower-energy sym-
metric stretching or bending modes. Transition to a lower level corresponding to symmetric stretching
produces 10.6 mm output while its transition to another lower level corresponding to symmetric bending
produces 9.6 mm output.
Figure 4.8
Vibrational modes in CO2 molecule.
Gas Lasers
111

In fact, around both 9.6 mm and 10.6 mm outputs, there are a large number of closely spaced lines as
shown in Figure 4.10. This is the outcome of rotational motion of the molecule. The rotational transition
energy is however much smaller than either the thermal or the vibrational transition energy. The
molecule can either speed up or slow down a little in its rotational motion while moving between the
vibrational levels. When it speeds up it takes energy from the vibrational transition, and when it slows
down it gives energy to the vibrational transition. In the two cases, the effective transition energy either
increases (in the case of slowing down of rotational motion) or decreases (in the case of speeding up of
rotational motion), thus changing the emitted wavelength around the nominal value.
A carbon dioxide laser also has a Doppler-broadened gain curve that is 60 MHz wide at 10.6 mm
output (Figure 4.11). The frequency uncertainty in the case of an unstabilized laser could be as much as
60 MHz. The laser could however be frequency stabilized either on the centre of gain curve, or anywhere
on the gain curve using some of the established frequency stabilization techniques to an accuracy of
Figure 4.9
Energy level diagram of CO2 laser.

Different wavelengths emitted by CO2 laser.
112
Lasers and Optoelectronics

better than 100 kHz. Some techniques allow the laser to be stabilized down to 10 kHz, making it an
ideal tool for carrying out Doppler-free spectroscopic studies. The frequency stabilization techniques are
discussed at length in Chapter 8 on gas laser electronics.
Carbon dioxide lasers employ either a sealed tube or ﬂowing gas construction. The gas mixture is
excited by an electric discharge. Both direct current (DC) as well as radio-frequency (RF) excitation has
been successfully and widely used in the case of CO2 lasers. As the electric discharge breaks down CO2
molecules to form carbon monoxide and oxygen, a catalyst is added to regenerate CO2. Figure 4.12
depicts a sealed-off CO2 laser of 48-series from Synrad Inc. The laser employs robust sealed-off
construction. Three different models in the series produce CW output power levels of 10, 25 and 50 W
with output beam divergence of 4 mrad and mode quality factor M2 < 1.2.
The ﬂowing-gas type of CO2 lasers may be of longitudinal ﬂow or transversal ﬂow. In the former case
the gas ﬂows along the axis of the cavity, while in the latter case it ﬂows perpendicular to the cavity axis.
In longitudinal ﬂow lasers (Figure 4.13) the gas pressure is low, the output power is also relatively lower
and lasers operate as CW lasers. Transverse ﬂow lasers (Figure 4.14) are normally used to obtain higher
power outputs. Gas pressures in such lasers can be higher. In the case of longitudinal ﬂow lasers, the gas
is usually recycled with some fresh gas added. In the case of transverse ﬂow lasers, the gas ﬂow through
the laser cavity is much faster, which removes waste heat and also the contaminants.
Pressure broadening of the line width also allows for mode-locked operation, thus enabling the
generation of pulses as short as 1 ns. For pressures approaching 10 atm, the line broadening is large
enough to allow near-continuous tuning across most of the wavelength range. Transverse ﬂow is usually
used in relatively higher output power lasers. While power in excess of 50 W per metre of gain length is
achievable in the case of sealed-off and longitudinal ﬂow carbon dioxide lasers, as much as 10 kW per
metre of gain length is achievable in the case of transverse ﬂow lasers.
Another type of CO2 laser is one that is transversely excited and where the gas pressure is about 1 atm.
The CO2 lasers described above have low gas pressures and usually produce CW output. CW lasers

cannot have high-pressure gas mixture as it is not practical to have a stable continuous discharge at
pressures above about 0.1 atm. Pulsed electric discharge is however possible at higher pressures and
works very well if the discharge is transverse to the laser axis; this transversely excited atmospheric
pressure (TEA) CO2 laser (Figure 4.15) is a high-power pulsed CO2 laser. The gas pressure is around
1 atm and the discharge is transverse to the laser axis. TEA CO2 lasers invariably use a form of pre-
ionization to uniformly ionize the space between the electrodes. The primary attraction of a TEA CO2

laser is its ability to generate short intense pulses and extraction of high power per unit volume of laser
gas mixture. Pulse durations of a few tens of nanoseconds to few microseconds and pulse energies from a
few millijoules to hundreds of joules at repetition rates of up to a few hundred hertz are achievable.
Waveguide CO2 laser is another type of CO2 laser that renders compactness. RF-excited sealed-off
waveguide CO2 lasers produce several watts to several tens of watts of CW output, demonstrating great
promise. Figure 4.16 depicts one such sealed-off RF-excited waveguide CO2 laser, Model No. v30 from
Synrad Inc. The laser produces 30 W of CW output with a beam divergence and beam quality factor M2
better than 7 mrad and 1.2, respectively.
4.4
Metal Vapour Lasers
The active medium in the case of metal vapour lasers is either ionized metal atoms in the helium-cadmium
family of lasers or neutral atoms in copper vapour and gold vapour lasers. The helium-cadmium lasers
produce emissions at 325 nm and 353.6 nm (ultraviolet) and 441.6nm (blue). The neutral metal vapour
lasers emit in thevisible spectrum. Copper vapour lasers emit at 511 nm (green) and 578 nm (yellow). Gold
vapour laser emits at 628 nm (red). Pumping takes place through electric discharge.
4.4.1
Helium-cadmium Laser
In the case of helium-cadmium lasers, electrons in the discharge plasma excite helium atoms to higher
energy levels. Excited helium atoms transfer their energy to cadmium atoms, ionizing them and raising
them to upper laser levels in the process. It is much easier to ionize cadmium than helium, due to the former
having only two electrons in its incompletely ﬁlled outer shell and the latter having a ﬁlled outer shell.

Cadmium is in solid form at room temperature and is heated to about 250 C to vaporize it to a pressure
of the order of a few milli-torr required for laser operation. Helium pressure is of the order of a few torr,
about a thousand times higher than that of cadmium. Helium-cadmium tubes usually have a helium gas
reservoir to replace helium gas that may leak out. Cadmium vapours may condense on relatively cooler
parts of the tube during laser operation. The tube is designed in order to have certain portions that can
collect surplus cadmium so that it does not deposit on the optical surfaces.
As for helium-neon lasers, helium-cadmium lasers have one of two optical designs: either resonator
mirrors sealed at the ends of the discharge tube or the tube sealed with Brewster windows and the resonator
mirrorsplacedoutsidethetube.Theemittedwavelengthdependsuponthechosenoptics.Figure4.18depicts

up to 55 mWof CWoutputat355 nm and upto130 mWofCWoutput at442 nm.The singletransversemode
lasers in this series offer beam divergence of 1.5 mrad and beam quality factor M2 < 1.2.
4.4.2
Copper Vapour and Gold Vapour Lasers
Important members of the family of metal vapour lasers where the lasing species is the neutral atom
vapour are the copper vapour and gold vapour lasers. As mentioned above, copper vapour lasers have two
emission lines at 511 nm and 578 nm and the gold vapour laser emits at 628 nm. Copper vapour and gold
vapour lasers are pulsed lasers with typical pulse repetition rates in the range of several kilohertz and
achievable average power of the order of tens of watts.
Figure 4.17

116
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Figure 4.19 depicts the energy level diagram of a copper vapour laser; a gold vapour laser has a similar
energy level structure. The energy level structure of a copper vapour laser can be used to explain why
such a laser cannot be used to produce a CW output; the description is equally valid for a gold vapour
laser. When an electric discharge passes through the metal vapour, electrons in the discharge plasma
collide with the metal vapour atoms (copper vapour atoms with reference to the energy level diagram of
Figure 4.19

Figure 4.19) and raise them to an excited state. The excited state has a lifetime of the order of 10 ns or so
if the metal vapour pressure is low. This small lifetime is not long enough to produce laser action. The
effective lifetime can be increased to about 10 ms (which is long enough to produce stimulated emission
and laser action) by increasing the vapour pressure to about 100 millitorr. To obtain this vapour pressure,
metallic copper or gold must be heated to a temperature in excess of 1500 C in the laser tube.
The problem begins with the long lifetime of the lower laser level, which is of the order of tens to
hundreds of microseconds. This leads to an accumulation of lasing species at the lower level, inhibiting
the laser action on a continuous basis. Laser action can be resumed after the lower laser level becomes
depopulated to the required level. This phenomenon allows these lasers to be operated only on a pulsed
basis, although the pulse repetition frequency can be sufﬁciently high. The addition of a rare gas such as
helium, neon or argon helps in depopulating the lower laser level.
Some of the signiﬁcant features of metal vapour lasers include a high gain of the laser medium
(10–30% per cm), high laser efﬁciency (typically several tenths of a percent) and high average power
(approaching 100 W).
4.5
Rare Gas Ion Lasers
Argon-ion and krypton-ion lasers are popular members of the family of rare gas ion lasers. The laser
emission in case of argon-ion and krypton-ion lasers occurs from the transitions made by ionized
argon and krypton atoms. These lasers emit a range of wavelengths from ultraviolet through the
entire visible spectrum. Shorter wavelengths (< 400 nm) are emitted from doubly ionized argon
(Arþ2) and krypton (Krþ2) atoms. Longer wavelengths are emitted from singly ionized argon (Arþ)
and krypton (Krþ) atoms. These lasers can generate output powers from a few milliwatts to a few
tens of watts, much higher than their CW gas laser counterparts such as helium-neon and helium-
cadmium lasers.
Although both argon-ion and krypton-ion lasers emit a range of wavelengths from ultraviolet through
visible to near-infrared, argon-ion laser has strong emission at 488 nm (blue) and 514.5 nm (green). A
krypton-ion laser emits strongly at 647.1 nm (red). Possible emissions from argon-ion lasers include
275.4 nm, 300.3 nm, 302.4 nm, 305.5 nm, 334 nm, 351.1 nm, 363.8 nm, 454.6 nm, 457.9 nm, 465.8 nm,
472.7 nm, 476.5 nm, 488 nm, 496.5 nm, 501.7 nm, 514.5 nm, 528.7 nm and 1090 nm. In case of krypton-
ion lasers, possible emission lines are 337.4 nm, 350.7 nm, 356.4 nm, 406.7 nm, 413.1 nm, 415.4 nm,
468 nm, 476.2 nm, 482.5 nm, 520.8 nm, 530.9 nm, 568.2 nm, 647.1 nm, 676.4 nm, 752.5 nm and
799.3 nm. The two gases can be put into a single tube and excited simultaneously to obtain laser lines
throughout the visible spectrum. Such mixed-gas lasers are used in laser light shows.
In the case of rare gas ion lasers, laser action can be explained with the help of the energy level diagram
of an argon-ion laser, as shown in Figure 4.20. A similar energy level structure also exists for krypton-ion
lasers. A high initial voltage ionizes the gas. Electrons in the electric current passing through the ionized
gas transfer energy directly to argon atoms, ionizing them and raising the resulting ions to a cluster of
high energy levels. Ions drop from populated metastable upper laser levels to a cluster of lower laser
levels. The emission wavelength depends upon the pair of levels involved in the transition. In fact, if
allowed by optics, several different wavelengths can be made to oscillate simultaneously. The ions drop
from the lower laser level with very short lifetime to ion ground state by emitting light at the extreme
ultraviolet wavelength of 74 nm.
Construction of these lasers is not very different from that of helium-neon lasers. These lasers usually
have Brewster window sealed plasma tubes with external cavity mirrors. The gas pressure is about
0.7–0.8 torr. Wavelength selection optics can be inserted between the Brewster window and the rear
mirror, if so desired. As for helium-neon lasers, the discharge is conﬁned to a narrow bore diameter in the
centre of the tube. A series of metal disks with central holes may also deﬁne the bore in these lasers. A gas
reservoir is also a part of the structure to replace the depleted gas. Wall-plug efﬁciency of these lasers is
in the range of 0.01–0.001%. Because of lower efﬁciency, high-output-power rare ion lasers need to be
cooled, either by forced air cooling (in case of medium-power lasers) or by liquid cooling (in case of
higher-output-power lasers.
118
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Figure 4.21 depicts an argon-ion laser of Innova-90C series from Coherent Inc. The laser is available
in the output power range of 3–6 W predominantly at 488 nm and 514.5 nm wavelengths. One of the most
common applications of argon-ion lasers is in laser light shows. They have been largely replaced by
diode-pumped solid-state lasers, as the latter are inherently smaller, more efﬁcient and reliable and
increasingly more versatile and less expensive than rare gas ion lasers.

Due to their broad line width of about 5 GHz, argon-ion lasers adapt themselves well to mode locking.
Mode-locked laser pulses from these lasers are suitable for pumping titanium-sapphire and tunable dye
lasers.
4.6
Excimer Lasers
Excimer lasers are pulsed lasers capable of providing pulse energies of the order of a few joules. These
are the most powerful practical lasers emitting in the ultraviolet region. With the exception of the ﬂuorine
excimer laser, all excimer lasers have an active medium consisting of molecules of one rare gas atom
such as argon, xenon or krypton and one halogen such as ﬂuorine, chlorine or bromine. The active
medium is a rare gas halide. Some of the more popular and practical excimer lasers include F2 (157 nm),
ArF (193 nm), KrCl (222 nm), KrF (249 nm), XeCl (308 nm) and XeF (350 nm).
The process of population inversion creation and subsequent laser emission in the case of excimer
lasers is unique. The two atoms constituting the molecule are bound to each other only when the
molecule is in the excited state, which is the upper laser level. The molecule falls apart when it drops to
the ground state, which is the lower laser level. Figure 4.22 shows the energy level diagram of a rare gas
halide molecule, depicting its behaviour both in the excited state where it is a molecule as well as in the
ground state where the molecule breaks apart as individual atoms. Figure 4.22 shows the energy level as a
function of the spacing between the rare gas atoms and the halogen atoms. The absence of any dip in the
energy level indicates that the atoms are not bound to each other and that their energy decreases as the
inter-atomic separation increases. The region in the excited state with a dip in the energy level is the one
indicating that the rare gas and halogen atoms are bound to each other to form molecules. These excited
molecules can occupy any of the several vibrational energy levels as shown by the horizontal lines. These
molecules fall apart as they fall to the ground state, as there is no bonding energy available in the
relatively lower-energy ground state to hold them together.
The gas mixture comprises the derived rare gas, the halogen and the buffer gas such as helium or neon.
In fact, more than 90% of the gas mixture is the buffer gas. The mixture has a small percentage of rare
gas. Present in an even smaller fraction is the source of halogen atoms. As pure halogens can pose serious

handling problems due to their high reactivity, it may be supplied in the form of molecules containing
desired halogen atoms. It is more so for ﬂuorine, which is considered to be the most dangerous to handle
of all the halogens and therefore may be supplied as nitrogen triﬂuoride (NF3). The gas mixture is excited
by passing a short intense electrical pulse through it. Electrons in the plasma transfer energy to the gas
mixture. The halogen molecules break up to form electronically excited molecules and create population
inversion. The upper state lifetime is about 10 ns. The molecules drop to the ground state and break up,
emitting ultraviolet radiation in the process.
Excimer lasers are the best-available pulsed lasers and have many applications in the semiconductor
manufacturing industry, research and medicine. Pulse energies from several microjoules to a few joules
are available at repetition rates of tens to a few hundreds of hertz. Repetition rates of a few kilohertz are
achievable, but the pulse energies available at those repetition rates are relatively lower. Krypton-ﬂuoride
(KrF) and xenon-chloride (XeCl) are the more energetic of all excimer lasers, and the average power in
these lasers can be in excess of 200 W.
4.7
Chemical Lasers
A chemical laser derives the energy required to produce population inversion and consequent laser emission
fromachemicalreaction.TheimportanceofchemicallasersliesintheirabilitytogenerateCWoutputpower
level reaching several megawatts. This output power, combined with the fact that the range of wavelengths
generated by these lasers is well absorbed by metals, makes them suitable for cutting and drilling operations
in industry and more so as high-power laser sources for directed-energy weapon applications.
There are two categories of chemical lasers. One category has hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) and deuterium
ﬂuoride (DF) and the other has two iodine lasers including chemical oxygen iodine laser (COIL) and all
gas-phase iodine laser (AGIL). Both HF/DF and COIL systems have the capability to be operated at
megawatt-class CW output power. Lasing action has been demonstrated in AGIL and efforts are
underway to scale the output to higher power levels.
In a chemical laser, a suitable chemical reaction produces a stream of gas rich in excited atoms or
molecules. Another gas is then injected into the stream, which reacts with the excited particles in the gas
stream to produce the excited species for laser action. In case of an HF/DF chemical laser, this stream of
gas is abundant in ﬂuorine atoms. Excited ﬂuorine atoms then react with hydrogen or its heavier isotope
deuterium to produce vibrationaly excited hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) or deuterium ﬂuoride (DF)
molecules (the asterisk denotes the excited state of the molecules). The laser emission is then due
to the transition of excited HF or DF molecules. In the case of COIL, the initial chemical reaction
produces singlet-delta oxygen. It transfers its energy to iodine to generate excited atomic iodine, which
subsequently produces laser emission at the wavelength of transition of atomic iodine. Both types of
chemical lasers are brieﬂy described in the following sections.
4.7.1
Hydrogen Fluoride/Deuterium Fluoride (HF/DF) Lasers
In the HF laser, ﬂuorine atoms are produced by pre-mixing ﬂuorine gas with helium used as a buffer gas
and some other gases. Helium is added to stabilize the reaction and control the temperature. Some other
gases may be added to control production of ﬂuorine atoms. Since ﬂuorine gas could be very nasty to
handle, it is usually supplied in the form of some other molecule such as sulphur hexaﬂuoride (SF6) or
nitrogen triﬂuoride (NF3). The free excited ﬂuorine atoms produced in the combustor are accelerated
through supersonic nozzles into a laser cavity. In the cavity, under low-temperature low-pressure
conditions, ﬂuorine atoms mix and react with hydrogen to form excited hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF)
molecules. A suitable resonator conﬁguration produces stimulated emission of photons from these
excited HF molecules. The output wavelength is in the region of 2.6–3.0 mm. Figure 4.23 shows a typical
block schematic arrangement of an HF laser.
Similar to the HF laser is the deuterium ﬂuoride (DF) laser. In this laser, deuterium replaces hydrogen
and reacts with ﬂuorine atoms to produce excited DF molecules (DF). Since deuterium is heavier than
hydrogen, a DF laser produces output at the longer wavelength range of 3.6–4.0 mm. While a HF laser
Gas Lasers
121

has the advantage of lower wavelength, a DF laser propagates relatively much better through
atmosphere. As a result, HF is better suited to space-borne platforms. Some of the better known HF/DF
laser systems include Alpha laser, MIRACL (mid-infrared advanced chemical laser) and THEL (tactical
high-energy laser; Figure 4.24). While ALPHA is a HF laser, MIRACL and THEL systems are
conﬁgured around DF lasers.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

MIRACL was the ﬁrst megawatt-class CW chemical laser. In the MIRACL system, free excited
ﬂuorine atoms are generated by the combustion reaction of a fuel (ethylene, C2H4) and an oxidizer
(nitrogen triﬂuoride, NF3). Deuterium and helium are injected into the exhaust downstream of the nozzle
to produce excited DF (DF) molecules. Excited DF molecules produce stimulated emission and laser
action in the resonator cavity, and the output is spread over several lasing lines in the wavelength range of
3.6–4.2 mm.
4.7.2
Chemical Oxygen Iodine Laser (COIL)
The three main parts of a COIL system are: the singlet oxygen generator (SOG); the supersonic nozzle;
and the laser cavity. Singlet-delta oxygen is produced through a reaction of gaseous chlorine and basic
hydrogen peroxide (BHP), which is a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and potassium hydroxide. This is a
highly exothermic reaction, releasing most of the energy as heat into the BHP solution. The rest of the
energy is used to generate singlet-delta oxygen, which is an electronically excited state of oxygen.
Potassium chloride is produced as a by-product of this reaction. Molecular iodine is injected into the gas
ﬂow in the plenum just upstream of the supersonic nozzle. The molecular iodine dissociates into atoms
through a series of energy transfer reactions with singlet-delta oxygen. Singlet-delta oxygen transfers its
energy to the iodine molecules injected into the gas stream in a collisional process. The transfer of energy
from singlet-delta oxygen to iodine is nearly resonant and thus very rapid. The excited iodine undergoes
stimulated emission in the resonator cavity, producing a laser output at 1.315 mm. Figure 4.25 shows the
block schematic arrangement of a COIL system.
COIL works at a relatively lower gas pressure. The pressure downstream of the nozzle is of the order of
a few torr, which makes its discharge to the atmosphere a difﬁcult proposition due to the large pressure
differential involved. This is not the case if the laser is to work on an airborne platform, however. COIL is
therefore the laser of choice for a laser-based directed-energy weapon (DEW) on an airborne platform.
The airborne laser (ABL) program of the US Air Force uses a high-power COIL system. ABL is one
part of a layered ballistic missile defence system that addresses the ever-increasing ballistic missile
threat. ABL is designed to destroy the hostile missile while it is still in the vulnerable boost phase of its
ﬂight (Figure 4.26). ABL uses an onboard surveillance system to detect and track the missile after
launch. The beam control system locks on to the target and then ﬁres the high-energy laser. The entire
system (i.e. the high-energy laser, the surveillance system and the beam control/ﬁre control system), is

conﬁgured on a Boeing 747–400 ﬁghter aircraft (Figure 4.27). ABL made its maiden ﬂight in July 2002.
In January 2010, the high-energy laser was used in-ﬂight to intercept (but not destroy) a test missile in the
boost phase of ﬂight. In February 2010, the system successfully destroyed a liquid-fuel boosting ballistic
missile. In December 2011, the ABL program was reportedly shelved as it was considered to be
operationally unviable.
4.7.3 
All Gas-Phase Iodine Laser (AGIL)
In AGIL, chlorine gas and gaseous hydrogen azide (HN3 ) are mixed to produce excited nitrogen chloride
(NCl) molecules. Nitrogen chloride then transfers energy to atomic iodine in the same manner as for
Figure 4.27

singlet-delta oxygen in COIL. This all gas-phase laser overcomes the disadvantage of the heavy aqueous-
based chemistry of a COIL device and the undesirable wavelength range of HF laser that is strongly
absorbed by the atmosphere. If scaled to higher power levels, it could be a potent laser technology for the
space-borne laser programme.
4.8
Carbon Dioxide Gas Dynamic Lasers
The gas dynamic laser (GDL) derives its energy from the combustion of a suitable fuel–oxidizer mixture,
which means that it does not require any electrical energy for its operation. A gas dynamic laser achieves
population inversion by the rapid expansion of a high-temperature high-pressure laser gas mixture
produced during combustion to a near vacuum in an adiabatic process through an integrated supersonic
nozzle bank. Although the expansion reduces the gas temperature, a large number of excited molecules
are still in the upper laser level. Population inversion is created if the reduction in pressure and
temperature downstream of the nozzle bank takes place over a time that is much shorter than the
vibrational relaxation time of the upper laser level, corresponding to an asymmetric stretching mode of
carbon dioxide coupled with nitrogen. The cavity axis is transverse to the direction of gas ﬂow. Since the
high-temperature high-pressure gas mixture is created in a combustion reaction, the laser is referred to as
combustion-driven gas dynamic laser (CD-GDL). Figure 4.28 shows the functional schematic arrange-
ment of a CD-GDL showing its various constituent subsystems. This type of laser, capable of producing
hundreds of kilowatts of CW power at 10.6 mm, was initially important as a potential high-power laser
(HPL) weapon. It has however been superseded by HF/DF and COIL systems due to the heavy
absorption of the 10.6 mm wavelength by water vapour in the atmosphere.
4.9
Dye Laser
Dye lasers are popular devices because of their inherent ability to produce a coherent output that is tunable
over a wide range of wavelengths from near-ultraviolet through visible to the near-infrared region. A single
dyecannot accountfor wavelength tunability from ultraviolettoinfraredhowever; dyesneed tobe switched.
The vibronic class of solid-state lasers is the only close competitor when looking for a tunable laser.
Dye lasers are particularly important in scientiﬁc research and some medical applications where a
large wavelength tuning range and their inherent ability to produce ultra-short pulses are an advantage.
While tunable output from dye lasers was initially considered for use in spectroscopic applications,
applications of dye lasers have expanded over the years to include medical applications for both
diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.
The tunability property of dye lasers is a result of the energy level diagram of the active medium. The
active medium is an organic dye characterized by upper and lower laser levels that are bands of a large
number of sublevels rather than single energy levels. Their ability to produce ultra-short pulses results from
the wide gain-bandwidth proﬁle characteristic of dye lasers. Titanium-sapphire lasers, members of the
vibronic class of solid-state lasers, also have a wide gain-bandwidth proﬁle and are therefore capable of
Figure 4.28
Functional schematic of a combustion-driven gas dynamic laser.
Gas Lasers
125

producing short pulses. Dye lasers however have an advantage that they cover the wavelength range from
ultraviolet to near-infrared; titanium-sapphire lasers can only produce output in the near-infrared.
The minimum pulse length producible from the laser is a function of gain-bandwidth proﬁle, a
phenomenon described in Chapter 1. Pulse length in nanoseconds is given by 0.441/bandwidth, where
bandwidth is in MHz.
4.9.1
Active Medium
The active medium in a dye laser is an organic dye. Organic dyes come from a family of complex
molecules characterized by electronic-vibrational levels. The complex sets of electronic and vibrational
levels associated with these molecules gives them the bright colour and hence the name dyes. The
vibrational levels in fact create sublevels of the excited electronic levels, thus leading to a band of upper
and lower laser levels in the same way as can be found in the vibronic class of solid-state lasers. The
similarity between the two is clearly visible in the energy level diagram of an organic dye as shown in
Figure 4.29. The dye is usually dissolved in a liquid solvent, which acts as the host material in the same
way as crystals and glasses in the case of solid-state lasers.
In the case of low-power CW lasers and pulsed lasers with modest average power, the laser dye
solution is contained in a sealed glass container called cuvette. In the case of higher power levels, the dye
solution is usually made to ﬂow rapidly through the cell to prevent it from becoming heated and
subsequently degraded. The dye solution may also be made to ﬂow in the form of an unconﬁned jet with
the help of a specially designed nozzle.
Some examples of laser dyes include rhodamine-6G, ﬂuorescein and coumarin. Rhodamin-6G is a
commonly used laser dye pumped by a frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser beam with a very high photo-
stability, high quantum yield, low cost and, more importantly, close proximity to the absorption
maximum (approximately 530 nm) of the dye. Figure 4.30 shows the absorption spectrum of a
rhodamine-6G laser dye. The tunable range is 555–585 nm with a maximum at 566 nm.

4.9.2
Pump Mechanisms
Dye lasers are optically pumped. They are either ﬂash-lamp pumped or pumped by pulsed lasers. In case
of ﬂash-lamp pumped dye lasers, there are two types. In one case, a linear ﬂash lamp pumps a parallel
linear dye cell in the same way as it pumps the laser rod in a solid-state laser. In the other case, a coaxial
ﬂash lamp is used and the dye ﬂows through the centre of the ﬂash lamp. Flash-lamp-pumped dye lasers
produce a pulsed laser output with a pulse repetition rate in the range of a few pulses per minute (in the
case of high-energy pulses) to a few hundreds of pulses per second (in the case of low-energy pulses).
Pulsed lasers are very usefully employed for the purpose of pumping dye lasers. Most lasers suitable for
dye laser pumping emit at the short wavelength end of the visible spectrum and in the ultraviolet, as dye
lasers mostly emit in visible wavelengths. Some of these lasers include frequency-doubled neodymium
lasers (532 nm), frequency-tripled neodymium lasers (355 nm), frequency-quadrupled neodymium lasers
(266 nm), copper vapour laser (510 nm and 578 nm), krypton-ﬂuoride excimer laser (249 nm), xenon-
chloride excimer laser (308 nm) and xenon-ﬂuoride excimer laser (351 nm). CW lasers are also used for
pumpingdye lasers toachieve CWoutputs.Argon,kryptonandneodymiumlasers are usedforthis purpose.

two reﬂective surfaces, functions like a miniature optical cavity and is used to limit oscillations to a narrow
range of wavelengths. Wavelength is selected by altering the distance between the two reﬂective surfaces.
4.10
Free-electron Lasers
A free-electron laser is unique in terms of its process of light ampliﬁcation. Unlike conventional lasers
that rely on bound atomic or molecular states, free-electron lasers use a relativistic electron beam as the
active medium. In the case of a free-electron laser, the lasing medium is a beam of free electrons
completely unattached to any atoms.

A relativistic particle is a particle moving at a speed close to the speed of light, such that the effects of
special relativity are important for its behaviour. Mass-less particles such as photons always move with
the speed of light and are therefore always relativistic. Particles with some mass are considered
relativistic when their kinetic energy is comparable to or greater than the energy mc2 corresponding to
their rest mass. This implies that their speed is close to that of light. Such particles are generated in
particle accelerators. In the context of free-electron laser, a beam of electrons is accelerated to relativistic
speeds and then made to pass through a periodic (or, more precisely, alternating) transverse magnetic
ﬁeld. The transverse magnetic ﬁeld is produced with the help of an array of magnets with alternating
poles placed along the beam path. The array of magnets is sometimes called a wiggler (and the magnetic
ﬁeld produced by it as the wiggler ﬁeld) as it forces the electron beam to assume a sinusoidal path. As the
beam travels through the magnetic ﬁeld, it releases some of its energy as light before it exits from the
other end of the ﬁeld. The emitted wavelength is given by Equation 4.1:

The same relationship may also be written in the form:

(4.2)
where

The free-electron laser is tunable over a wide range of wavelengths in the region from x-rays to
microwaves by varying E. The accelerated beam of electrons with the desired energy can be obtained
from well-established technology of charged particle accelerators. Figure 4.31 depicts the simplistic
arrangement of various components in a free-electron laser.
Figure 4.31
Free-electron laser.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Although thought of as potential sources for DEW application, free-electron lasers have their
problems when it comes to generating higher powers at shorter wavelengths. Smaller free-electron
lasers with power output up to 100 W are particularly important for research and medical applications,
however.
4.11
X-Ray Lasers
The level of complexity involved in generating a coherent beam of x-rays is evident from a simple
calculation: an energy level difference of the order of 100 eVor so is needed between the two laser levels
in order to generate a 10 nm laser output. Creating a population inversion in an x-ray laser is a gigantic
task. That is why these lasers are either excited by nuclear explosions or by massive Q-switched Nd:
Glass lasers meant for fusion research. The development of x-ray lasers was initiated during the ‘Star
Wars’ program but, due to technological complexities and infrastructure requirements, x-ray lasers are
not considered an attractive proposition.
4.12
Summary
 Gas lasers have widely varying characteristics including wavelength range, power levels and, to some
extent, pump mechanisms. Power level varies from a fraction of a milliwatt (in low-power He-Ne
lasers) to the megawatt level (in weapon-class high-power lasers). Thousands of gas laser wavelengths
have been discovered from ultraviolet to far-infrared. Gas lasers have Doppler-broadened gain versus
frequency curve and most gas lasers are excited by electrical discharge.
 The active medium in a gas laser is almost invariably a mixture of more than one gas with gases other
than the lasing species performing certain subtle functions (e.g. assisting in heat transfer as helium in
carbon dioxide laser or depopulating the lower laser level as helium in helium-neon laser). The active
media in different gas lasers may not be in the same form; they could be in the form of ionized atoms
(argon-ion and krypton-ion lasers) or hot metal vapour (copper vapour and gold vapour lasers).
 Excimer lasers are pulsed lasers capable of providing pulse energies of the order of joules and are the
most powerful lasers emitting in ultraviolet.
 Chemical lasers derive their pump energy from a chemical reaction. There are two categories of
chemical laser: (1) HF/DF lasers and (2) COIL and AGIL.
 Gas dynamic lasers derive their pump energy from the combustion of a suitable fuel–oxidizer mixture,
which means that they do not require any electrical energy for operation.
 Dye lasers (which are not gas lasers) have an inherent ability to produce coherent output tunable over a
wide range of wavelengths from near-ultraviolet through visible to near-infrared region. Their wide
gain-bandwidth proﬁle means they are capable of producing ultra-short pulses. They are optically
pumped either by ﬂash lamp or by another suitable laser. Free-electron lasers use a relativistic electron
beam as active medium, tunable over a wide range of wavelengths in the region from x-rays to
microwaves.

Semiconductor Lasers
5.1
Introduction
In continuation of our discussion on types of lasers, the focus in this chapter is on semiconductor lasers.
Most semiconductor lasers are diode lasers that are pumped by an electrical current; these are also known
as injection diode lasers. However, there are also optically pumped semiconductor lasers, either from a
direct-coupled single emitter or ﬁbre-coupled laser diode array, and quantum cascade lasers that utilize
intra-band rather than inter-band transitions of the conventional semiconductor lasers for laser action.
Most of the discussion in this chapter is centred on semiconductor diode lasers, which typically emit in
visible to near-infrared bands of electromagnetic spectrum. Optically pumped semiconductor lasers,
quantum cascade lasers, lead salt lasers and antimonide lasers are also brieﬂy discussed. Topics covered
in this chapter include operational fundamentals, semiconductor materials used for making semi-
conductor lasers, different types of semiconductor diode lasers, characteristic parameters, handling
precautions and application areas.
5.2
Operational Basics
The active medium in a semiconductor laser is a semiconductor material. The optical gain in this case is
usually achieved by a process of stimulated emission at an inter-band transition triggered by prevailing
conditions of high carrier density in the conduction band. In the case of diode lasers, high carrier density
in the conduction band is caused by an injection current. The emission of radiation is due to the
recombination of holes and electrons in a forward-biased P-N junction diode. An injection diode laser
powered by an injected electrical current is the most practical form of diode laser, distinguishable from
an optically pumped diode laser.
Figure 5.1 illustrates the operational basics of a semiconductor diode laser action. Figure 5.1a and b
depict no forward bias and applied forward bias greater than the band gap energy conditions,
respectively. As shown in the diagrams, energy levels up to the Fermi level are occupied by electrons.
The Fermi level is continuous across the junction under zero-applied forward-bias conditions. When a
forward bias with corresponding energy greater than the band gap energy Eg is applied across the
junction, the barrier potential reduces to zero. Fermi level on the N-side (EFN) and P-side (EFP) are
separated by eVF where e is electronic charge and VF is forward bias voltage. There are more electrons in
the conduction band near EC than in the valence band near EV. This leads to population inversion near EC
and EVenergy levels. This region of population inversion along the junction is called an inversion layer
or active region. Due to the presence of electrons and holes in the active region, there is a likelihood of
their recombination leading to spontaneous emission of a photon. The energy of an emitted photon
equals the difference in energy levels of electron and hole states involved in the recombination. In the
process, the electron may re-occupy the energy state of the hole. The injected electrons and holes

comprise the injection current and those involved in the recombination process constitute the spontane-
ously emitted photon output.
If the injection current exceeds a certain minimum value called the lasing threshold, the number of
electrons and holes available for recombination becomes sufﬁciently large such that a spontaneously
emitted photon with energy equal to the involved recombination energy stimulates an electron-hole pair.
These recombine to emit a photon of the same frequency, phase and polarization as that of the stimulating
photon, which is referredto as stimulated emission. Surroundingthe recombinationregion (alsocalled gain
region) bya suitableoptical cavity facilitates theprocess ofstimulated emission.Inthecase of a diodelaser,
the cavity is made by cleaving the two ends of the crystal to form perfectly smooth parallel edges forming a
Fabry–Perot resonator. Since the semiconductors have a high refractive index, the smooth surfaces offered
by cleaved ends reﬂect about 30% of the light back into the material to achieve sustained laser action in a
high-gain semiconductor laser material. The stimulated emission produces light ampliﬁcation as the
photons travel back and forth between the two end-faces of the cavity. When the gain due to stimulated
emission exceeds the losses due to absorption or imperfect reﬂections, sustained lasing action is produced.
Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) operate in the same way, with a major difference in the forward-biased
current. While the current in the case of an LED is of the order of a few milliamperes, the current in the

case of laser diodes emitting few milliwatts of laser power is of the order 80–100 mA. At low levels of
drive current, spontaneous emission predominates. When the drive current is more than the lasing
threshold, the light output is predominantly due to stimulated emission. Figure 5.2a and b show the
current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of a typical LED and a semiconductor diode laser. As shown in
the ﬁgure, the LED turns on for a forward-bias voltage greater than or equal to the turn-on voltage and the
current ﬂowing through the device is nearly zero. In the case of a laser diode, although the device is
turned on and a small magnitude of current does start ﬂowing, the lasing action starts only after the
forward voltage exceeds the lasing threshold voltage.
This phenomenon can also be explained with the help of output optical power versus drive current
characteristics of the laser diode shown in Figure 5.3. As shown in the ﬁgure, stimulated emission
becomes predominant, thereby leading to sustained lasing action only after the drive current exceeds a
certain lasing threshold current value. For drive currents less than the threshold value, spontaneous
emission predominates and an LED-like emission is obtained.

Semiconductor Laser Materials
Only direct band gap semiconductor materials are suitable for building diode lasers and LEDs, although
some compound semiconductors with indirect band gap can be used to make LEDs. In the case of direct
band gap materials such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), gallium nitride (GaN) and gallium aluminium
arsenide (GaAlAs), a transition from conduction band to valence band releases all its energy in the form
of light. In the case of indirect band gap materials such as silicon, some of it goes into vibrations of the
crystal lattice which makes it difﬁcult for this class of semiconductor materials to emit light by
recombination of charge carriers. Compound semiconductors are used for making laser diodes. For laser
applications, the most important of these are those comprising equal amounts of elements from III-A
(gallium, aluminium and indium) and V-A (arsenic, antimony, phosphorus and nitrogen) groups of the
periodic table. Compounds with three elements are referred to as ternary compounds, and compounds
with four elements are called quaternary compounds. The generalized formula for the most commonly
used ternary compounds is ðGa1x Alx AsÞ, where 0 < x < 1.
Other important ternary compounds for semiconductor diode laser fabrication include indium gallium
nitride (InGaN), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) and gallium antimonide arsenide (GaSbAs).
There are two types of commonly used quaternary compounds with generalized formulae
ðIn1x Gax As1y PyÞ and ðIn1xy Gax AlyPÞ where 0 < x, y < 1.
From the generalized expressions of the two types of compound semiconductors, it is evident that
elements from groups III-A and V-A of the periodic table are present in equal quantities. In the ﬁrst case,
the quantity of gallium and aluminium (Group III-A elements) together is the same as that of arsenic
(Group V-A). Similarly, in the case of one type of quaternary compounds, the quantity of indium and
gallium (Group III-A) put together is the same as that of the total quantity of arsenic and phosphorus
(Group V-A). In the other type of quaternary compound, the total quantity of indium, gallium and
aluminium (Group III-A) is the same as that of the total quantity of phosphorus (Group V-A).
To summarize, commonly used semiconductor material compositions for semiconductor diode laser
fabrication, with examples of common laser wavelengths, include: gallium arsenide (905 nm at room
temperature), gallium nitride (405 nm), gallium aluminium arsenide (785 nm and 808 nm), aluminium
gallium arsenide (1064 nm), indium gallium arsenide (980 nm), indium gallium nitride (405 nm and
445 nm), gallium antimonide arsenide (1877 nm, 2004 nm, 2330 nm, 2680 nm, 3030 nm and 3330 nm),
indium gallium arsenide phosphide (1310 nm, 1480 nm, 1512 nm, 1550 nm and 1625) and aluminium
gallium indium phosphide (635 nm, 657 nm, 670 nm and 760 nm).

Types of Semiconductor Lasers
Depending upon the structure of various semiconductor materials used to fabricate semiconductor lasers,
these can be categorized as either:
1. homojunction and heterojunction lasers
2. quantum well diode lasers
3. distributed-feedback (DFB) lasers
4. vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs)
5. vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VECSELs)
6. external-cavity semiconductor diode lasers
7. optically pumped semiconductor lasers
8. quantum cascade lasers
9. lead salt lasers.
These are all described brieﬂy in the following sections.
5.4.1
Homojunction and Heterojunction Lasers
The boundaries between the active layer and the adjacent layers play an important role in determining
some of the vital parameters such as efﬁciency of the lasers. In the case of homojunction lasers, all layers
are of the same semiconductor material. One such example is GaAs/GaAs laser. However, this simple
laser diode structure is highly inefﬁcient and can only be used to demonstrate pulsed operation. In the
case of heterojunction lasers, the active layer and either one or both of the adjacent layers are of different
material. If only one of the adjacent layers is of a different material, it is called a simple heterojunction; if
both are different, it is called a double heterojunction.
Some of the popular semiconductor laser types and the corresponding emission wavelength band are
listed in Table 5.1.
In heterostructure diode lasers, a layer of low band gap material is sandwiched between layers of a
high band gap material as shown in Figure 5.4. One such commonly used pair of materials is gallium
arsenide (GaAs) and aluminium gallium arsenide (AlxGa1–xAs). In these devices, the active region (the
region where free electrons and holes exist simultaneously) is conﬁned to the thin middle layer. As a
result of this, a relatively much larger number of electron–hole pairs can contribute to the ampliﬁcation
process. Light is also reﬂected from the heterojunction, which helps to conﬁne the emitted photons to the
active region. These factors contribute to the high efﬁciency of heterostructure diode lasers.
5.4.2
Quantum Well Diode Lasers
For semiconductor layers that are only a few nanometers thick, the assumption that the material is a
continuum is no longer valid and the quantum mechanical properties of atoms and electrons become
important. When a thin layer of a semiconductor material with a relatively smaller band gap is
sandwiched between two thick layers with larger band gaps, a structure known as a quantum well is
formed and the electrons passing through the semiconductor are captured in the thin layer. Although

these electrons have sufﬁcient energy to be free in the small band gap quantum well layer, it is not enough
to allow them to enter the large band gap thicker layers. The thicker layers therefore help in conﬁning the
captured electrons to the quantum well. If the quantum well is placed in the semiconductor junction, the
concentration of electrons as they recombine with holes to emit photons leads to an increase in efﬁciency
and a decrease in lasing threshold. The fact that the quantum well layer and the outer thicker layers are
made from semiconductor materials of different refractive indices further helps the cause by conﬁning
the emitted photons to that narrow region. Figure 5.5a shows the basic structure of a simple quantum well
semiconductor diode laser.

One of the drawbacks of the simple quantum well structure of Figure 5.5a is that the thin layer is too
small to effectively conﬁne the light. A modiﬁcation of this basic quantum well structure is shown in
Figure 5.5b. In this, two additional layers are added outside three existing layers. The additional layers
made of material A in Figure 5.5b have a refractive index that is smaller than the refractive indices of the
centre layers made of materials B and C. Such an arrangement succeeds in conﬁning the light with
greater efﬁcacy than is feasible with a simple quantum well structure. Semiconductor diode lasers having
this modiﬁed structure are referred to as separate conﬁnement heterostructure (SCH) lasers. Most
practical diode lasers have an SCH quantum well structure.
Lasers with more than one quantum well layer are known as multiple quantum well lasers. These are
nothing but a stacked arrangement of quantum wells and conﬁnement layers. Multiple quantum well
structures can generate relatively higher power outputs.
An extension of the quantum well concept has led to the development of what are known as quantum
wire and quantum dot structures. While a quantum well structure can conﬁne electrons in only one
dimension, that is, in the plane of quantum well layer, quantum wire and quantum dot structures provide
conﬁnement in two and three dimensions, respectively. This leads to further improvement in laser
efﬁciency. A quantum dot laser uses quantum dot structures as the active medium. As a result of the tight
conﬁnement of charge carriers, quantum dot semiconductor diode lasers offer improved performance as
compared to lasers built on bulk or quantum well active media in terms of modulation bandwidth, lasing
threshold, relative intensity noise and temperature sensitivity. The quantum dot active region may be
engineered by varying the dot size and composition to operate on different wavelengths, which is not
possible with semiconductor laser technology.
Yet another type is a quantum cascade laser in which a laser transition occurs between different
energy levels of the quantum well instead of the band gap, which allows operation at longer wavelengths.
The wavelength can be tuned by changing the thickness of quantum layer. Quantum cascade lasers are
described in Section 5.4.8.
5.4.3
Distributed-feedback (DFB) Lasers
Diode lasers have a gain-bandwidth curve that is broad enough to accommodate several longitudinal
modes. In a conventional diode laser, due to changes in temperature and other operating conditions,
Figure 5.5

the dominant longitudinal mode may therefore hop from one value to the next adjacent value, leading to
instability in output power and wavelength. There are applications where this instability is highly
undesirable. One such example is ﬁbre-optic communication where instability in output wavelength
causes chromatic dispersion in the ﬁbre, thus limiting its utility.
DFB lasers offers a mechanism of ensuring a very narrow output wavelength band. In this, a diffraction
grating is etched very close to the active layer (Figure 5.6). The grating provides wavelength-selective
feedback to the gain region. The feedback causes interference and only the narrow wavelength region for
which the interference is constructive is allowed to sustain. DFB lasers offer single longitudinal and
transverse mode operation. For a diffraction grating with pitch D, wavelength l is given by Equation 5.1:
l ¼ 2nD
m
(5.1)
where n is the refractive index of the medium and m is a positive integer. Typical values of m are 1 or 2,
indicating the order of distributed feedback coupling. A slight shift in output wavelength is possible due to
temperature dependence of n.
Since the grating provides the feedback required for lasing in a DFB laser, end faces are not required to
do that. That is why one of the end faces is anti-reﬂection coated. Because of their narrow line width and
wavelength tunability, DBF lasers ﬁnd extensive use in optical communications, spectroscopy, gas
sensing and metrology. In fact, DFB lasers today are the workhorse of ﬁbre-optic communication
systems. Figure 5.7 depicts some DFB laser types from Eagleyard Photonics, Germany. These lasers are
available in the wavelength range 760–1083 nm and output power levels 10–150 mW. The FWHM
spectral width, temperature coefﬁcient of wavelength (dl/dT) and current coefﬁcient of wavelength
(dl/dI) of this series of DFB laser diodes are 2.0 MHz, 0.06 nm K1 and 0.003 nm A1, respectively.
These are ideally suited to applications such as spectroscopy, metrology and gas sensing.
Example 5.1
Determine the pitch of the ﬁrst-order diffraction grating in a distributed feedback laser, if the laser were
to emit at 1000 nm and the laser medium had a refractive index of 2.5.
Solution
1. Pitch ¼ ml/2n
2. For a ﬁrst-order grating, m ¼ 1
3. Therefore, pitch ¼ l/2n ¼ 1000/5 nm ¼ 200 nm.

5.4.4
Vertical-cavity Surface-emitting Laser (VCSEL)
In the diode laser structures discussed so far, the optical cavity is perpendicular to the direction of current
ﬂow. In the case of VCSELs, the optical cavity is along the direction of ﬂow of injection current as shown
in Figure 5.8. The laser beam in this case emerges from the surface of the wafer rather from its edges.
Having mirrors on both sides of the active medium forms the resonant structure. Mirrors are usually of
the distributed Bragg reﬂector type formed by a multilayer structure of alternating low and high
refractive index semiconductor materials. Mirrors in this case need to be highly reﬂective as the overall
gain is low due to the short length of the gain medium. Compared to edge emitting lasers, these lasers
produce relatively lower output power levels. However, VCSEL require a very small chip area, typically
a few tens of squared microns, with the result that a large number of such lasers can be tightly packaged
in an array structure on a single chip. These lasers are characterized by a very small threshold current,
which could be as low as 1 mA.
5.4.5
Vertical External-cavity Surface-emitting Lasers (VECSEL)
In the case of vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), the two mirrors are either grown
epitaxially as a part of the diode structure or grown separately and then bonded to the semiconductor chip
having the active region. Vertical external-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VECSELs) are a variant of
VCSEL where the resonator is completed with a mirror placed external to the diode structure, thus
introducing a free space region in the resonant cavity as shown in Figure 5.9. Compared with other types
of semiconductor diode lasers, VECSELs are capable of generating much higher optical powers with
high beam quality. When mode area is large, an external resonator is necessary for achieving high beam
quality. Although VCSELs have a large mode area, they are not suitable for generating high-power levels
with high beam quality.
In the case of VECSELs, the resonant cavity may contain some additional optical elements such as an
optical ﬁlter to facilitate wavelength tuning or a saturable absorber for passive mode locking to generate
picosecond- and femtosecond-pulses at a repetition rate of few gigahertz. The insertion of a non-linear

Lasers and Optoelectronics

crystal in the cavity allows frequency doubling which, for example, could lead to fabrication of devices
with red, green and blue outputs. A VECSEL is a low-gain device and the intra-cavity power is much
higher than the output power. This facilitates intra-cavity frequency doubling.
A typical VECSEL has a gain structure with a Bragg reﬂector and a gain medium with multiple
quantum wells. Typical material combinations used to generate different wavelength regions include a
GaAs wafer, InGaAs quantum wells in the gain medium and a Bragg reﬂector grown from AlAs and
GaAs. This structure is suitable for generating wavelengths in the region 960–1030 nm. Emission in the
1.5 mm region is possible with indium phosphide (InP) as the wafer material, indium gallium arsenide
phosphide (InGaAsP) quantum wells and indium phosphide/indium gallium aluminium arsenide
(InP/InGaAlAs) combination for Bragg mirror. For longer wavelengths such as 2.0 mm, gallium indium
antimonide (GaAlSb) quantum wells could be used on gallium antimonide (GaSb) wafers.
5.4.6
External-cavity Semiconductor Diode Lasers
The basic operational concept of an external-cavity diode laser (ECDL) is similar to that of VECSEL,
which is an external-cavity semiconductor laser.
An ECDL is a semiconductor diode laser whose resonator is completed with one or more optical
components outside the diode laser chip. In the simplest form, the diverging output from one of the anti-
reﬂection-coated end faces is collimated by an external lens. The collimated beam is made to fall on a
partially reﬂecting mirror that provides optical feedback and acts as an output coupler. An ECDL allows
Figure 5.8

for a longer resonator, which in turn leads to lower phase noise and narrow emission line width resulting
from the increased damping time of intra-cavity light. The external resonator also opens up the
possibility of introducing suitable intra-cavity optical elements for wavelength selectivity and tuning
and mode locking.
A diffraction grating is usually employed for wavelength selectivity and tuning. Two common
conﬁgurations are Littrow conﬁguration and Littman–Metcalf conﬁguration. Figure 5.10 shows the
basic schematic arrangement of the Littrow conﬁguration: a diffraction grating is used as the end mirror
with a ﬁrst-order diffracted beam providing optical feedback. Wavelength tuning is achieved by
changing grating orientation. This conﬁguration has the drawback that the direction of output beam

142
Lasers and Optoelectronics

changes with wavelength tuning. This problem is overcome in a Littman–Metcalf conﬁguration shown in
Figure 5.11, where grating orientation is ﬁxed and an additional mirror is used to provide ﬁrst-order
feedback. The mirror is rotated for wavelength tuning. The direction of output beam in this case is ﬁxed.
The beam undergoes wavelength-dependent diffraction twice per resonator round-trip, resulting in
higher wavelength selectivity and a narrower line width.
External-cavity diode lasers ﬁnd extensive use in applications such as spectroscopy, where a tunable
narrow line width source is important.
5.4.7
Optically Pumped Semiconductor Lasers
Some of the problems of the edge-emitting conventional semiconductor lasers such as high divergence,
asymmetry and astigmatism are largely overcome by VCSELs. The features of VCSELs are further
improved by introducing an external cavity to widen the horizon of its capabilities in the case of
VECSELs. However, the conventional electrically pumped VCSELs and VECSELs cannot match the
output power capability of edge-emitting devices as it is not practical to ﬂood a large area with charge
carriers through electrical pumping without using extended electrodes. Extended electrodes introduce
too much of loss, and are therefore not desirable. The solution lies in employing optical pumping by
another diode laser as shown in the simpliﬁed schematic arrangement of Figure 5.12.
An optically pumped semiconductor laser (OPSL) is simply a vertical external-cavity semiconductor
laser that is pumped optically. The active region in this case comprises alternate layers of a binary
semiconductor material and tertiary semiconductor material quantum wells. The emission wavelength
depends upon the stoichiometry and physical dimensions of quantum wells.
As is evident from Figure 5.12, the pump radiation enters the chip at an angle. The off-axis pump
geometry facilitates the use of multiple pumps arranged azimuthally for the generation of higher output
power. The off-axis pump geometry also ensures that the intra-cavity beam is not obstructed by pump
beam relay optics. The non-collinear pumping ﬁlls the mode volume and introduces very little ellipticity.
OPSLs offer several advantages over their diode-pumped solid-state laser counterparts, in terms of far
less stringent requirement of pump source wavelength band and absence of thermal lensing. Their
biggest advantage however is in their ability to be readily customized over a wide range of emission
wavelengths and their superior longitudinal mode characteristics. For example, intra-cavity frequency-
doubled and -tripled outputs in an optically pumped InGaAs gain chip cover almost the full visible band
(355–577 nm).
The above-mentioned features mean that OPSLs ﬁnd extensive use in medical therapeutics, life
sciences, forensics, light shows and scientiﬁc research. OPSL technology allows the designer to think of
many new applications or improve many existing applications previously limited by the ﬁxed

wavelength feature of conventional electrically pumped semiconductor lasers. They use the best
wavelength for the intended application, rather than having to work around the closest-ﬁt wavelength.
Figure 5.13 depicts OPSLs of Genesis MX-series from Coherent Inc. The Genesis MX-series is a
range of high-power CW optically pumped semiconductor lasers. Variants of this series offer output
powers in the range of 500 mW to 20 W and emission wavelength band of 460–1154 nm. Genesis MX-
series lasers are intended for use in medicine, life sciences, defence and scientiﬁc research applications.

5.4.8
Quantum Cascade Lasers
Quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) are compact high-power wavelength-agile semiconductor lasers that
emit in the mid-infrared to far-infrared wavelength band. The upper limit of emission wavelength can
even extend to the terahertz region. The semiconductor lasers described in earlier sections are all inter-
band devices where laser radiation is emitted due to the recombination of electrons in the conduction
band and holes in the valence band across the band gap of the semiconductor material. The earliest
double heterostructure devices had an operating wavelength that was exclusively dependent on the band
gap energy as shown in Figure 5.14a. In the case of quantum well structures, as shown in Figure 5.14b,
carriers are conﬁned to energy levels within these wells, introducing the possibility of lower transition
energies thereby extending the operating wavelength. Semiconductor diode lasers are bipolar devices;
quantum cascade lasers on the other hand are unipolar devices. Laser emission in the latter case occurs
across inter-subbands, which are also called intra-band transitions, of electrons in the conduction band as
shown in Figure 5.14c.
The gain region comprises a periodic structure of an active region and an injector region as shown in
Figure 5.15. The overall downward trend in energy levels is due to an applied electric ﬁeld. In the case of
a conventional bipolar semiconductor laser, electrons and holes are annihilated after they undergo
recombination across the band gap and can therefore play no further role in photon generation. In the
case of unipolar QCL, after the electron has undergone an intra-band transition and generated a photon in
a given period of superlattice it can tunnel into the next period of the structure, causing emission of
another photon. As the electron traverses through the QCL structure, it causes emission of multiple
photons. This increases optical gain, leading to generation of higher output power. The intra-band
transition energy in the case of QCL depends upon the design parameters, such as layer thickness of
quantum wells, rather than the material system properties. As a result, emission wavelength can be
tailored to anywhere within a wide spectral band from mid-infrared to far-infrared for the same
semiconductor material.
In order to make a light emitting device the gain region is conﬁned in an optical waveguide, enabling
the photon emission to be directed into a collimated beam and a laser resonator to be built. Two types of
optical waveguides – ridge waveguide and buried heterostructure waveguide – are in common use. A
detailed description of the two types of waveguides is beyond the scope of this text, however.
Several material systems are in use for the fabrication of QCLs. One of the earlier QCLs was
fabricated by using a InGaAs/InAlAs material system in an InP substrate. The quantum well depth of
0.52 eVof the InP devices emits in the mid-infrared spectral band. InP-based QCLs have achieved high
levels of performance with the development of high-power CW devices operating above room
temperature. Another common material system used for fabrication of QCLs is GaAs/AlGaAs. This
material system offers variable quantum well depth depending on the aluminium fraction in the barriers.
These devices have been successfully used to generate output in the terahertz region. Yet another

Inter-band and intra-band laser transitions in semiconductor lasers.
Semiconductor Lasers
145

material system in use for QCLs is InGaAs/AlAsSb. With a quantum well depth of 1.6 eV, QCL devices
emitting at 3.0 mm have been fabricated. The emission wavelength is further reduced to about 2.5 mm in
InAs/AlSb QCLs, which have a quantum well depth of 2.1 eV.
Intra-band optical transitions are independent of the relative momentum of conduction band and
valence band minima, with the result that QCLs based on indirect band gap materials are feasible.
Si/SiGe is one such material system that has shown promise for fabricating QCL devices. The alternating
layers of two different semiconductor materials forming the quantum heterostructure are grown onto a
substrate using various methods such as molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), metal organic vapour phase
epitaxy (MOVPE) and metal organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD).
Different types of resonators are used to build QCL devices. These include Fabry–Perot lasers,
distributed-feedback lasers and external cavity lasers. Fabry–Perot cavity QCL is the simplest. The
ends ofthe crystalline semiconductordevice are cleavedoneither endofthewaveguide toformtwo parallel
mirrors. The residual reﬂectivity offered by the cleaved facets creates the resonant cavity. Fabry–Perot
QCLs are capable of generating high powers, although the output tends to be multimode at higheroperating
currents. The emission wavelength can be tuned by changing the operating temperature of the device.
The DFB QCL has a distributed Bragg reﬂector built on the top of the waveguide to prevent it from
emitting at anything other than the desired wavelength; otherwise it is similar to Fabry–Perot
conﬁguration. This allows the DFB QCL to operate at a single wavelength even at higher operating
currents. The laser wavelength can be tuned by changing device temperature. Another mode of operation
of DFB QCL is the chirped mode in which the laser is pulsed and the wavelength of laser is rapidly
chirped during the course of the pulse. This facilitates rapid scanning of a given wavelength band.
In the case of external-cavity QCL, one or both of the cleaved facets are given anti-reﬂection coating.
As a result, cleaved facets no longer provide cavity action. The optical cavity is created by mirrors placed
external to the device. A frequency selective optical element such as a diffraction grating may be used in
the external cavity to achieve both single-wavelength operation and wavelength tuning (Figure 5.16).

Lasers and Optoelectronics

High output power in the mid-infrared to far-infrared spectral region extending to terahertz, tunability
and room-temperature operation make quantum cascade lasers highly suitable for a wide range of
applications in remote sensing of environmental gases and atmospheric pollutants, vehicular cruise
control and collision avoidance in poor visibility conditions, medical diagnostics, industrial process
control and homeland security.
5.4.9
Lead Salt Lasers
Lead salt semiconductor lasers are semiconductor diode lasers generating wavelength tunable pulsed and
continuous wave (CW) output in the mid-infrared spectral band, particularly useful in high-resolution
absorption spectroscopy used for detection and identiﬁcation of trace gases with high sensitivity and
selectivity. In general, tunable CW mid-infrared laser sources are grouped as class A and class B sources.
Class A sources include those that generate tunable mid-infrared laser radiation directly from the gain
media, which could be a gas discharge, a semiconductor material, rare-earth- and transition-metal-doped
bulk solid-state material or optical ﬁbre. Class B includes those laser sources where mid-infrared output
is generated by the optical parametric frequency conversion of a near-infrared radiation. Most of the mid-
infrared laser sources using solid-state, gas and semiconductor lasing media have been covered earlier in
this chapter and in Chapters 3 and 4 on solid-state lasers and gas lasers, respectively.
A lead salt semiconductor laser is a P-N junction diode laser that consists of a single crystal of lead
telluride (PbTe), lead selenide (PbSe), lead sulphide (PbS) or their alloys with themselves or with
strontium selenide (SnSe), strontium telluride (SnTe), cadmium sulphide (CdS) and other materials. The
structure of laser cavity is similar to the conventional semiconductor diode laser employing a Fabry–
Perot resonator cavity comprising two parallel end faces. The injection current populates the near-empty
conduction band and laser radiation is emitted by the process of stimulated emission across the band gap.
In the case of lead salt semiconductor lasers the band gap energy is very small, in the range 0.25–0.30 eV.
These lasers require cryogenic cooling for population inversion and laser action. The band gap energy
depends on semiconductor composition and temperature. The band gap energy and hence the operating
wavelength may be tailored by either varying the stoichiometry between lead and other elements or by
using different alloys of lead.
Wavelength tuning over 100 cm1 by changing temperature or over 10 cm1 by changing injection
current is possible. Temperature tuning is basically due to a change in band gap energy; injection current
tuning is due to a change in refractive index of the active region. Temperature tuning rates of 2.0–
5.0 (cm K)1 and injection current tuning rates of 0.02–0.07 cm1 are achievable. The temperature
tuning mechanism is relatively sluggish as it involves changing the temperature of the entire laser
package. On the other hand, current tuning process is very rapid.
Lead salt lasers emit in the 3–30 mm band and are characterized by large beam divergence and
astigmatism, which puts particularly stringent requirements on the ﬁrst optical element of collection
optics. Typical CW power level from lead salt lasers is in the range 0.1–0.5 mW. CW operation has been
reported for temperatures above 200 K and pulsed operation to above 80 C.

5.5
Characteristic Parameters
Important characteristic parameters of diode lasers relate either to their I–V characteristics or the output
beam characteristics. These include threshold current, slope efﬁciency and linearity of laser operation in
the case of the former, and beam divergence, line width and beam polarization in the case of the latter.
Most of the characteristic parameters are sensitive to changes in temperature. Different parameters and
their sensitivity to temperature changes are brieﬂy described in the following sections.
5.5.1
Threshold Current
Threshold current is the minimum forward-biased injection current needed to achieve sustained laser
action. When the injection current is below the threshold value, most of the input electrical energy is
dissipated as heat and conversion to light output is highly inefﬁcient. Higher threshold current therefore
means that more electrical energy must be dissipated as heat energy. Current density is deﬁned as ratio of
threshold current to the active area and measured in units of A cm2. It is also referred to as the ﬁgure-of-
merit of the diode laser, as it determines the lifetime of the laser. Higher-threshold current density
shortens the lifetime of the laser diode. I–V characteristics of the laser diode indicating threshold current
are highlighted in Figure 5.3, and the light power versus drive current characteristics of a semiconductor
diode laser indicating lasing threshold current are depicted in Figure 5.3.
Threshold drive current is a function of temperature and increases rapidly with increasing tempera-
ture. The change in threshold current Is (DT) due to incremental change in temperature DT is computed
from Equation 5.2:
IsðDTÞ ¼ IsðTÞ  e DT=T0
ð
Þ  1
h
i
(5.2)
where Is(T) is the threshold current at absolute temperature T and T0 is a substrate-speciﬁc characteristic
temperature (e.g. T0 lies within 120–230 K for GaAlAs diode laser and 60–80 K for InGaAsP lasers). The
lower the value of T0, the more sensitive is the laser to changes in temperature.
A shift in threshold current occurs primarily due to the temperature dependency of the carrier
concentration in the active layer and the probability of non-radiative recombination processes.
Figures 5.17 and 5.18 show the effect of change in temperature on I–V characteristics and light power
versus drive current characteristics of semiconductor lasers, respectively. An increase in temperature
also adversely affects the lifetime of the laser as it leads to an increase in threshold current density.
Lifetime approximately doubles for every decrease in chip temperature by 10 C. This is taken into
account by mounting the chip on a heat sink.
Example 5.2
The temperature of a certain InGaAsP laser chip increases by 30 K. If the characteristic temperature
ﬁgure for this laser is taken to be 60 K, prove that the threshold current would undergo a 65% increase
from its value before the occurrence of temperature change.

5.5.2
Slope Efﬁciency
Slope efﬁciency is determined by the slope of the characteristic I–V curve above the threshold current and
is measured in mW mA1 (or WA1). In the case of a pigtailed device, slope is reduced by a factor
depending upon the coupling efﬁciency of laser power into the ﬁbre.
148
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Slope efﬁciency is strongly dependent upon temperature and decreases with increasing temperature,
as shown in Figure 5.18.
Example 5.3
Refer to the family of curves shown in Figure 5.19. Determine the percentage change in slope efﬁciency
of the laser diode as the operating temperature changes from 25 C to 50 C.
Solution:
1. For the output power versus drive current at 25 C, above lasing threshold,
Output power for a drive current of 50 mA ¼ 2.5 mW
Output power for a drive current of 60 mA ¼ 5 mW.
2. Therefore, slope efﬁciency ¼ (5  2.5)/(60  50) mW mA1 ¼ 0.25 mW mA1
3. For the output power versus drive current at 50 C, above lasing threshold,
Output power for a drive current of 60 mA ¼ 2 mW
Output power for a drive current of 70 mA ¼ 4 mW.
4. Therefore, slope efﬁciency ¼ (4  2)/(70  60) mW mA1 ¼ 0.2 mW mA1
5. Percentage decrease in slope efﬁciency ¼ (0.25  0.20/0.25)  100% ¼ 20%.
5.5.3
Beam Divergence
Laser diodes characteristically produce a highly diverging laser beam with the exception of surface-
emitting diode lasers. Higher divergence is primarily inﬂuenced by the diffraction of light waves as
they are coupled out of the chip. Also, due to the rectangular-shaped active light-emitting area with
Figure 5.17
Temperature dependence of I–V characterristics.
Semiconductor Lasers
149

strongly differing edge lengths, the divergence in the two orthogonal planes is different as shown in
Figure 5.20. Divergence in the plane parallel to the plane of the active layer is relatively much smaller
than that in the plane perpendicular to the active layer. As a result, the laser beam appears as an
elliptical spot at some distance from the laser. If required, it is possible to circularize the elliptical
beam with the help of a cylindrical lens, which refracts the light in parallel direction. VCSELs
produce a relatively more symmetrical beam and the beam divergence is also relatively lower due to
their large emitting area.

Line Width
Line widthis anotherimportant speciﬁcation.Inthe case of gain-guided lasers(described inSection 5.6), the
envelope of gain proﬁle typically has a 3 dB width of 2–3 nm, which corresponds to a frequency range of
about1000GHzat800nm.Suchagain-bandwidthproﬁlecansupportalargenumberoflongitudinalmodes.
In the case of an index-guided laser (also described in Section 5.6), one spectral line is dominant with the
result that the line width is much narrower, typically 102 nm. This corresponds to a frequency spread of a
few GHz at 800 nm. In the case of DFB lasers, which is also index guided, the line width is still smaller; it is
typically of the order 104 nm, which corresponds to a frequency spread of a few MHz at 800nm.
The spectral proﬁle of semiconductor lasers is also strongly affected by temperature changes. Both the
gain proﬁle as well as individual lines shift to longer wavelengths with an increase in temperature.
Figure 5.21 shows the effect of change in temperature on gain proﬁle. Effect on individual lines is due to

an increase in resonator length accompanied by an increase in refractive index. Typical values of
temperature coefﬁcient are listed in Table 5.2.
5.5.5
Beam Polarization
Beam polarization is another important parameter. Diode lasers emit almost linearly polarized light if
driven above threshold, which is inﬂuenced by polarization dependency of the reﬂection factor of the
emission area of the crystal.
5.6
Gain- and Index-guided Diode Lasers
The narrow stripe of the active layer that is responsible for generating laser output deﬁnes whether the
laser is gain guided or index guided. In the case of gain-guided lasers, an insulating layer on the top of the
laser chip conﬁnes the ﬂow of injection current to a narrow stripe in the active layer, with the result that
only this region has sufﬁcient gain to produce sustained laser action. There is no gain at the sides so those
regions do not emit light, even though no physical boundary separates the stripe from the rest of the
active layer.
In the case of index-guided lasers, the stripe from where laser emission takes place is deﬁned by
semiconductor composition and associated change in refractive index. The current ﬂows only through
the central ‘mesa’ and the stripe of the active layer buried below it. The layers that border the sides of the
active layer have a different composition and different refractive index, trapping the light in the active
stripe as the adjacent layers conﬁne light in the active layer in a double-heterostructure laser. Index-
guided lasers produce better beam quality and are used in most laser applications.
5.7
Handling Semiconductor Diode Lasers
Diode lasers exhibit high reliability and a long lifetime exceeding 100 000 hours providing certain
precautions are taken while handling them and also in the design of the driver circuits used to power
them. Diode lasers are particularly sensitive to electrostatic discharge, short duration electric
transients such as current spikes, injection current exceeding the prescribed limit and reverse voltage
exceeding the breakdown limit. Damage to the laser diode often manifests itself in the form of
reduced output power, a shift in the value of threshold current and its inability to be focused to a sharp
spot. The electrostatic discharge caused by human touch is the most common cause of premature
failure of a diode laser.
In order to protect the diode lasers from the above failure modes, the driver circuit should be carefully
designed and should have all the features recommended by the manufacturer of the laser. The driver
should be a constant current source with inbuilt features such as soft start, protection against transients,
interlock control for the connection cable to the laser and safe adjustable limit for injection current. If the
laser is to be operated in the pulsed mode, the injection current should be pulsed between two values
above the lasing threshold, rather than between cut-off and lasing mode. Leading manufacturers of diode
lasers offer a wide variety of suitable current sources for low-, medium- and high-power laser diodes.
They also offer temperature controllers to stabilize the output wavelength. Drivers and temperature
controllers for diode lasers are discussed in Chapter 9.

Semiconductor Diode Lasers: Application Areas
Diode lasers ﬁnd extensive use in commercial, industrial, medical, military and scientiﬁc applications.
Depending on application, one or more of the inherent characteristics of the laser beam is exploited,
including directed energy due to low divergence, coherence and monochromaticity (or narrow
bandwidth of emission spectrum).
5.8.1
Directed Energy
The applications that utilize the directed energy property of the laser light include laser printing, barcode
reading, image scanning, target illumination and designation, laser surgery, laser-based ignition of
combustion reaction, laser-based ignition of explosives and optical data recording.
In the case of laser printing, the laser beam modulated by the information to be printed scans across a
rotating drum that is coated with some kind of light-sensitive material. In doing so, it writes a pattern of
charged and uncharged areas corresponding to the printed page. The drum picks up the toner and
transfers the image to the plane paper. In the case of barcode reading with lasers, the laser beam
illuminates the object. A receiver circuit then reads the reﬂected beam containing the information. Low-
power visible and infrared diode lasers are used on small arms to illuminate targets to improve accuracy
of aim in low light and dark conditions. The laser beam is bore-sighted with the barrel of the weapon.
Infrared laser diodes are also used as target illuminators in night vision devices to enhance their
performance. Laser-based ignition is achieved by focusing the laser beam to the region of interest.
Optical data recording is also performed by a modulated laser beam containing the information to be
stored by scanning across a light-sensitive surface.
5.8.2
Coherence
Applications that exploit the coherence property of laser light include distance measurement with an
interferometer, holography and coherent communication. An interferometer makes use of the phenom-
enon of interference of waves for accurate measurement of small distances. Accuracy of the order of less
than the wavelength of the laser used is possible with this method. Holography allows us to record three-
dimensional images of objects. Both amplitude as well as phase information of the light reﬂected from
the object is recorded on the photographic plate to create a hologram. In order to record the hologram of a
three-dimensional object, the coherence length of the laser used should be at least equal to the
dimensions of the object. Initially, laser-created holograms could only be viewed in laser light; advances
have made it possible to view them in white light. The phenomenon of holography combined with
interferometry can be used to study the deformation behaviour of objects under stress.
5.8.3
Monochromaticity
Applications that make use of monochromaticity mainly include telecommunications, spectroscopy and
a large number of biomedical diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Spectroscopy helps in the study of
materials by measuring wavelengths absorbed and emitted by them. The monochromaticity of lasers
allows precise quantiﬁcation of absorption and emission phenomena.
Laser diodes are extensively used in telecommunications because of the ease with which they can be
modulated and coupled to optical ﬁbres. Biomedical diagnostics is simply the application of laser-based
spectroscopy. Laser-based ﬂuorescence and absorption spectroscopy is used in diagnostic instruments to
identify abnormalities, count cells and make many more measurements. Lasers are widely used in a
variety of therapeutic applications which exploit the wavelength-dependent interaction of laser light and
body tissues. Laser ophthalmology, laser dermatology, laser surgery including ﬁbre-optic surgery, laser
dentistry and many more applications such as laser-based photodynamic therapy for cancer treatment are
very common. Another potential application of laser-based spectroscopy is in the detection and
identiﬁcation of chemical and biological contaminants in the atmosphere.
The applications described here are only a summary of the major application areas; these and many
others are covered in detail in Part IV of the book covering applications of lasers and optoelectronics.

Summary
 In a semiconductor diode laser, emission of radiation is due to the recombination of electrons and
holes in a forward-biased P-N junction. Only direct band gap semiconductor materials are suitable for
making diode lasers. Compound semiconductors are used for making diode lasers; the most important
of these comprise equal amount of elements from the III-A and V-A periodic table groups. Both
ternary and quaternary compounds are used.
 Depending upon the structure of semiconductor materials used, diode lasers are categorized as
homojunction and heterojunction lasers, quantum well lasers, DFB lasers, VCSELs, VECSELs,
external-cavity semiconductor diode lasers, optically pumped semiconductor lasers, quantum cascade
lasers and lead salt lasers.
 All layers in a homojunction laser are of the same semiconductor material. One such example is
GaAs/GaAs lasers. However, this simple laser diode structure is highly inefﬁcient and can only be
used to demonstrate pulsed operation.
 The active layer and either one or both of the adjacent layers in a heterojunction laser are of different
materials. If only one of the adjacent layers is of a different material it is a simple heterojunction; if
both are different, it is called a double heterojunction.
 A quantum well layer is placed in the semiconductor junction of a quantum well diode laser. The
concentration of electrons as they recombine with holes to emit photons leads to an increase in
efﬁciency and a decrease in lasing threshold. The fact that the quantum well layer and the outer thicker
layers are made from semiconductor materials of different refractive indices contributes to perform-
ance by conﬁning the emitted photons to that narrow region.
 Lasers with more than one quantum well layer are known as multiple quantum well lasers, a stacked
arrangement of quantum wells and conﬁnement layers. Multiple quantum well structures can generate
relatively higher power outputs.
 The extension of the quantum well concept has led to the development of quantum wire and quantum
dot structures. While a quantum well structure can conﬁne electrons in only one dimension (i.e. in the
plane of quantum well layer), quantum wire and quantum dot structures provide conﬁnement in two
and three dimensions, respectively. This leads to a further improvement in laser efﬁciency.
 In a quantum cascade laser, the laser transition occurs between different energy levels of quantum well
and not the band gap. This allows operation at longer wavelengths, which can be tuned by changing the
thickness of the quantum layer. QCLs are compact high-power wavelength-agile semiconductor lasers
that emit in the mid-infrared to far-infrared wavelength band.
 Different types of resonators are used to build QCL devices: Fabry–Perot lasers, distributed-feedback
lasers and external-cavity lasers. High output power, tunability and room temperature operation make
QCLs highly suitable for a wide range of applications. DFB lasers ensure a very narrow output
wavelength band by use of a diffraction grating which provides a wavelength-selective feedback to the
gain region. The feedback causes interference and only the narrow wavelength region for which the
interference is constructive is sustained.
 In the case of VCSEL, the optical cavity is along the direction of ﬂow of injection current. The laser
beam in this case emerges from the surface of the wafer rather from its edges. The two mirrors are
either grown epitaxially as a part of the diode structure or grown separately and then bonded to the
semiconductor chip having the active region. A VECSEL is a variant of VCSEL, where one of the
mirrors is placed externally to the diode structure thus introducing a free-space region in the resonant
cavity.
 Lead salt semiconductor lasers are semiconductor diode lasers generating wavelength tunable pulsed
and CW output in mid-infrared spectral band, particularly useful in high-resolution absorption
spectroscopy used for detection and identiﬁcation of trace gases with high sensitivity and selectivity.
A lead salt semiconductor laser is a P-N junction diode laser that consists of a single crystal of PbTe,
PbSe, PbS or their alloys with themselves or with SnSe, SnTe, CdS and other materials.
 Lead salt lasers emit in the 3–30 mm band and are characterized by large beam divergence and
astigmatism, which puts particularly stringent requirements on ﬁrst optical element of collection
154
Lasers and Optoelectronics

optics. Typical CW power level from lead salt lasers is in the range 0.1–0.5 mW. CW operation has
been reported for temperatures above 200 K and pulsed operation to above 80 C.
 ImportantcharacteristicparametersofdiodelasersrelateeithertotheirI–Vcharacteristics(thresholdcurrent,
slope efﬁciency and linearity of laser operation) or the output beam characteristics (beam divergence, line
width and beam polarization). Most of the characteristic parameters are sensitive to changes in temperature.
 Both threshold current and slope efﬁciency are adversely affected by an increase in temperature. While
threshold current increases with increasing temperature, slope efﬁciency decreases with increasing
temperature. The spectral proﬁle of diode lasers is also strongly affected by temperature changes. Both
the gain proﬁle as well as individual lines shift to longer wavelengths with increasing temperature.
 In the case of gain-guided lasers, an insulating layer on the top of the laser chip conﬁnes the ﬂow of
injection current to a narrow stripe in the active layer, with the result that only this region has sufﬁcient
gain to produce sustained laser action. In the case of index-guided lasers, the stripe from where laser
emission takes place is deﬁned by semiconductor composition and an associated change in refractive
index. Index-guided lasers produce a better beam quality and are used in most laser applications.
 Diode lasers are particularly sensitive to electrostatic discharge, short duration electrical transients
such as current spikes, injection current exceeding prescribed limit and reverse voltage exceeding
breakdown limit.

Introduction
Chapter 1–5 have discussed the fundamentals such as operational basics (Chapter 1) and characteristics
of lasers (Chapter 2) followed by the three main types of lasers in Chapters 3–5. In the present chapter we
discuss the basic building blocks of electronics commonly used to design most of the laser sources and
systems conﬁgured around them. The intention is to familiarize the readers with the operational basics of
these building blocks and make it easier to understand the speciﬁc laser electronics packages discussed in
the following chapters. This chapter will particularly beneﬁt laser and optoelectronics students and
professionals who do not have comprehensive knowledge of electronics. Chapters 7–9 are then devoted
to extensive coverage of electronics packages of each of the three major types of lasers (solid-state, gas
and semiconductor).
6.2
Linear Power Supplies
Every electronics system, whether an entertainment gadget or a test-and-measurement device, requires
one or more DC voltages for operation. It is essential in most cases and almost always desirable that these
DC voltages are ﬁltered and well regulated. The power supply provides required DC voltages from
available AC mains in the case of mains-operated systems and from DC input in the case of portable
systems. Power supplies are often classiﬁed as linear power supplies or switched-mode power supplies,
depending upon the nature of regulation circuit. In the following sections we discuss the basic
constituents of a linear power supply, including transformers, rectiﬁers, ﬁlters and voltage regulators.
Switched-mode power supplies are discussed in Section 6.3.
6.2.1
Constituents of a Linear Power Supply
A linear power supply essentially comprises a mains transformer, a rectiﬁer circuit, a ﬁlter circuit and a
regulation circuit (Figure 6.1). The transformer provides voltage transformation and produces the AC
voltage(s) across its secondary winding(s) required for producing desired DC voltages. It also provides
electrical isolation between the input power supply, that is, AC mains and the DC output. Step-down
transformers required for generating common DC voltages and load current ratings are commercially
available. Step-up transformers for generating higher output voltages could be custom designed.
The rectiﬁer circuit changes the AC voltage appearing across the transformer secondary to DC or,
more precisely, a unidirectional output. Commonly used rectiﬁer circuits include the half-wave rectiﬁer,
conventional full-wave rectiﬁer (requiring a tapped secondary) and the full-wave bridge rectiﬁer.

The rectiﬁer voltage will always have some AC content, known as power supply ripple. The ﬁlter circuit
smoothestherippleoftherectiﬁedvoltage.The regulatorcircuitisatypeoffeedback circuitthatensures that
the output DC voltage does not change from its nominal value due to a change in linevoltage or load current.
In a linearly regulated power supply the active device, usually a bipolar junction transistor, is operated
anywhere between cut-off and saturation. Commonly used regulator circuit conﬁgurations include an
emitter-follower regulator, a series-pass transistor regulator and a shunt regulator. An emitter-follower
regulator is in fact now available in an integrated circuit (IC) package in both ﬁxed-output voltage as well
as variable-output voltage varieties. These three terminal regulators are discussed in Section 6.2.4.
All power supplies have in-built protection circuits. Common protection features include current limit,
short-circuit protection, thermal shut down and crowbarring.
6.2.2
Rectiﬁer Circuits
Figures 6.2 and 6.3 show the three rectiﬁer circuits for positive and negative output voltages, respectively,
along with input and output waveforms. The rectiﬁer circuits shown in Figures 6.2a and 6.3a are half-wave
rectiﬁer circuits. Circuits shown in Figures 6.2b and 6.3b are conventional full-wave rectiﬁer circuits.
Figures6.2cand 6.3cshowfull-wavebridgerectiﬁerconﬁgurations.Thecircuitsareselfexplanatory.Some
common terms used with reference to rectiﬁer circuits are deﬁned in the following.
Ratio of rectiﬁcation is the ratio of DC power delivered to the load to the AC power rating of the
transformer secondary. It is the lowest (¼ 0.287) in the case of half-wave rectiﬁer, 0.693 for a
conventional full-wave rectiﬁer and highest (¼ 0.812) for a bridge rectiﬁer.
Ripple frequency in the case of a half-wave rectiﬁer is f and 2f for full-wave rectiﬁers (conventional
and bridge), where f is the frequency of AC mains.
Ripple factor is the ratio of the RMS amplitude of the AC component to the the DC component. It is
1.21 for half-wave and 0.482 for full-wave rectiﬁers.
Peak inverse voltage that appears across the rectiﬁer diodes in the three cases is Vm for a half-wave
rectiﬁer, 2Vm for a conventional full-wave rectiﬁer and Vm for a bridge rectiﬁer, where Vm is the peak
value of the AC voltage appearing across the secondary.

6.2.3
Filters
The ﬁlter in a power supply helps to reduce the ripple content which, in the rectiﬁed waveform, is so large
that the waveform can hardly be called a DC. Inductors, capacitors and inductor–capacitor combinations
are used for the purpose of ﬁltering. The fact that an inductor offers high reactance to AC components is
the basis of ﬁlter action provided by inductors. In the case of an inductor ﬁlter, also referred to as a choke
ﬁlter, the ripple factor r is given by Equation 6.1:
r ¼
RL

(6.1)
where RL is load resistance in ohms (V), L is inductance in henries (H) and v (¼2pf) is angular frequency
in radians. The above equation simpliﬁes to RL=1330L for a power line frequency of 50 Hz. Figure 6.4
shows an inductor ﬁlter used at the output of a full-wave bridge rectiﬁer, along with input and output
waveforms.
As is clear from the above expression, the ripple factor r is directly proportional to load resistance RL.
That is, ripple content increases with an increase in load resistance. In other words, a choke ﬁlter is not

Lasers and Optoelectronics

effective for light loads (or high values of load resistance) and is preferably used for relatively higher
load currents.
The ﬁltering action of a capacitor connected across the output of the rectiﬁer comes from the fact that it
offers a low reactance to AC components. Figure 6.5a shows the capacitor ﬁlter connected across theoutput
of a bridge rectiﬁer. The AC components are bypassed to ground through the capacitor and only the DC is
allowed to go through to the load. The capacitor charges to the peak value of the voltage waveform during
the ﬁrst cycle and, as the voltage in the rectiﬁed waveform is decreasing, the capacitor voltage is not able to
follow the change as it can only discharge at a rate determined by the time constant CRL where C is
capacitance. In the case of lightloads (or high valuesof load resistance),the capacitor woulddischarge only
a little before the voltage in the rectiﬁed waveform exceeds the capacitor voltage, thus charging it again to
the peak value (Figure 6.5b). The ripple content is inversely proportional to C and RL.
Ripple can be reduced by increasing C for a given of RL. For heavy loads when RL is small, even a large
capacitance value may not be able to provide ripple within acceptable limits. Ripple factor r is also given
by Equation 6.2:
r ¼

(6.2)
where f is the power line frequency. This simpliﬁes to 2886=CRL for a power line frequency of 50 Hz.
Here capacitance C is in microfarads (mF) and RL is in ohms (V).
We have seen that while a choke ﬁlter is effective only for heavy load currents, a capacitor ﬁlter provides
adequate ﬁltering only for light loads. The performance of inductor and capacitor ﬁlters deteriorates fast as
load resistance is increased in the case of the former or decreased in the case of the latter. An appropriate
combination of L and C could give us a ﬁlter that would provide adequate ﬁltering over a wide range of RL
values. For all practical purposes, the ripple factor in a choke input L–C ﬁlter is independent of RL and is
given by 1:2=LC for a power line frequency of 50 Hz. In this expression, L is in henries and C is in
microfarads. Figure 6.6 shows an LC ﬁlter connected across the output of a full-wave rectiﬁer.
The inductance value in the choke input LC ﬁlter should be such that the current I through the
inductance never falls to zero, which amounts to saying that the negative peak of the ripple current should
never exceed the DC value of the current. The minimum inductance that achieves this is known as critical

inductance. The chosen value of inductance should be greater than the critical inductance. Critical
inductance is given by LC ¼ RL=755 for a power line frequency of 50 Hz, where RL is in ohms and LC is
in henries.
6.2.4
Linear Regulators
As outlined earlier, the regulator circuit in the power supply ensures that the load voltage (in the case of
voltage-regulated power supplies) or the load current (in the case of current-regulated power supplies) is
constant, irrespective of variations in line voltage or load resistance. In this section we discuss the
different types of voltage regulator circuits. Constant-current sources are discussed in Section 6.4. The
three basic types of linear voltage regulator conﬁgurations are: emitter-follower regulator, series-pass
regulator and shunt regulator. Each of these is brieﬂy described in the following sections.
6.2.4.1
Emitter-follower Regulator
Figure 6.7 shows the basic positive-output emitter-follower regulator. The emitter voltage, which is also
the output voltage, remains constant as long as the base voltage is held constant. A Zener diode
connected between the base and ground terminals ensures this. The regulated output voltage in this case
is given by Equation 6.3:
VO ¼ VZ  0:6
(6.3)
where VZ is the voltage of the Zener diode in volts.
Figure 6.6
LC (choke input) ﬁlter.
Figure 6.7
Emitter-follower regulator for positive output voltages.
166
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Due to high inherent current gain of the series-pass transistor, a low-power Zener diode can be used to
regulate the high value of load current. The base current in this case only needs to be (1/hFE) times the
load current, where hFE is the current gain of the transistor in the common emitter conﬁguration.
Figure 6.8 shows the emitter-follower regulator circuit for negative output voltages. If the load current is
so large that it is beyond the capability of a Zener diode to provide the requisite base current, a Darlington
combination can be used instead of a single-transistor series-pass element (Figures 6.9 and 6.10).
6.2.4.2
Series-pass Regulator
Figure 6.11 shows the basic components of a series-pass linear regulator. The series-pass element, a
bipolar transistor in the circuit shown, works like a variable resistance with the conduction of the
transistor dependent upon the base current. The regulator circuit functions as follows.
A small fraction of the output voltage is compared with a known reference DC voltage and their
difference is ampliﬁed in a high-gain DC ampliﬁer. The ampliﬁed error signal is then fed back to the base
of the series-pass transistor to alter its conduction in order to maintain a constant output voltage. The
regulated output voltage in this case is given by Equation 6.4:
VO ¼ VRef  ðR1 þ R2Þ=R2
(6.4)
where VRef is reference voltage.
Figure 6.9
Emitter-follower regulator with Darlington element (positive output voltage).

As the output voltage tends to decrease due to a decrease in input voltage or an increase in load current,
the error voltage produced as a result of this causes the base current to increase. The increased base
current increases transistor conduction, thus reducing its collector emitter voltage drop, which
compensates for the reduction in the output voltage.
Similarly, when the output voltage tends to increase due to an increase in input voltage or a decrease in
load current, the error voltage produced as a consequence is of the opposite sense. It tends to decrease
transistor conduction, thus increasing its collector-emitter voltage drop and maintaining a constant
output voltage. The regulation provided by this circuit depends upon the stability of the reference voltage
Vref and the gain of the DC ampliﬁer. A typical series-pass regulator circuit using a bipolar junction
transistor as the error ampliﬁer is shown in Figure 6.12.
The power dissipated in the series-pass transistor is the product of its collector-emitter voltage and the
load current. As the load current increases within a certain range, the collector-emitter voltage decreases
due to the feedback action, keeping the output voltage as constant. The series-pass transistor is chosen in
order to safely dissipate the power under normal load conditions. If there is an overload condition for
some reason, the transistor is likely to be damaged if such a condition is allowed to persist for long. In the
worst case, if there was a short circuit at the output the whole of the unregulated input would appear
across the series-pass transistor, increasing the power dissipation to a prohibitively large magnitude and

eventually destroying the transistor. Even a series-connected fuse does not help in such a case, as the
thermal time constant of the transistor is much smaller than that of the fuse. It is therefore always
desirable to build overload protection or short-circuit protection in the linearly regulated power supply
design. One such conﬁguration is shown in Figure 6.13.
Under normal operating conditions, transistor Q3 is in saturation. It therefore offers very little
resistance to the load current path. In the event of an overload or a short circuit, diode D1 conducts thus
reducing the base drive to transistor Q3. Transistor Q3 offers an increased resistance to the ﬂow of load
current. In the event of a short circuit, the whole of input voltage would appear across Q3. Transistor Q3
should be chosen in order to safely dissipate the power given by the product of worst-case unregulated
input voltage and the limiting value of current. Diode D1 and transistor Q3 should preferably be mounted
on the same heat sink so that the base-emitter junction of Q3 and the diode’s P-N junction are equally
affected by temperature rise and the short-circuit-limiting current is the preset value.
Other possible circuit conﬁgurations can also provide the desired protection, but a comprehensive
discussion of all is beyond the scope of this book. Other types of protection features that are usually built
into power supplies include crowbarring and thermal shutdown. Crowbarring is a type of over-voltage
protection and thermal shutdown disconnects the input to the regulator circuit in the event of the active
device(s) temperature exceeding a certain upper limit. Control and protection functions are usually
provided by an integrated circuit (IC) in a modern power supply. Awide range of control ICs is available
for both linear and switched-mode power supplies.

6.2.4.3
Shunt Regulator
In a series-type linear regulator, the pass element is connected in series with the load and any decrease or
increase in the output voltage is accompanied by a decrease or increase in the collector-emitter voltage of
the series-pass element. In the case of a shunt-type linear regulator (Figure 6.14), regulation is provided
by a change in the current through the shunt transistor to maintain a constant output voltage. The
regulated output voltage in a shunt-regulated linear power supply is the unregulated input voltage minus
drop across a resistance R1. The current through R1 is the sum of load current IL and current through shunt
transistor Is. As the output voltage decreases, the base current through the transistor reduces with the
result that its collector current Is also reduces. This reduces drop across R1, and the output voltage is
restored to its nominal value. Similarly, any tendency of the output voltage to increase is accompanied by
an increase in current through the shunt transistor, consequently increasing voltage drop across R1 which
in turn maintains a constant output voltage. A Darlington combination in place of a shunt transistor
enhances the current capability (Figure 6.15).
A shunt regulator is not as efﬁcient as a series regulator for the simple reason that the current through
the series resistor in the case of the former is the sum of load current and shunt transistor current, and it

dissipates more power than the series-pass regulator with same unregulated input and regulated output
speciﬁcations. In a shunt regulator, the shunt transistor also dissipates power in addition to the power
dissipated in the series resistor. The only advantage of a shunt regulator is its simplicity and protection
against overload condition.
6.2.4.4
Linear IC Voltage Regulators
In the previous section we discussed series and shunt regulator circuits designed with discrete
components. Present-day regulating circuits are almost exclusively conﬁgured around one or more
integrated circuits known as IC voltage regulators. IC voltage regulators are available to meet a wide
range of requirements. Both ﬁxed-output voltage (positive and negative) and adjustable-output voltage
(positive and negative) IC regulators are commercially available in a wide range of voltage, current and
regulation speciﬁcations. These have built-in protection features such as current limit and thermal
shutdown.
The IC 723 is an example of a general-purpose adjustable-output voltage regulator that is capable of
being operated in positive or negative power supplies as a series, shunt and switching regulator. The
internal schematic arrangement of IC 723 resembles the typical circuit for a series-pass linear regulator
and comprises a temperature-compensated reference, an error ampliﬁer, a series-pass transistor and a
current limiter with access to remote shutdown. Figure 6.16 shows the internal schematic arrangement of
regulator IC 723.
Figures 6.17 and 6.18 show the basic circuits for building low positive-output voltage (2–7 V) and high
positive-output voltage (7–37 V) regulator circuits. In the case of Figure 6.17, the regulated output
voltage is given by Equation 6.5:
VO ¼ VRef  R2=ðR1 þ R2Þ
(6.5)
In the case of the circuit arrangement of Figure 6.18, the output voltage is given by Equation 6.6:
VO ¼ VRef  ðR1 þ R2Þ=R2

In both cases, the recommended value of R3 is R1R2= R1 þ R2

short-circuit limiting value.

In their basic operational mode, three-terminal regulators require virtually no external components.
These are available in both ﬁxed-output voltage (positive and negative) as well as adjustable-output
voltage (positive and negative) types in current ratings of 100 mA, 500 mA, 1.5 A and 3.0 A. Popular
ﬁxed positive-output voltage three-terminal regulators include LM/MC 78XX-series and LM 140-
XX/340-XX series. LM117/217/317 is a common adjustable positive-output voltage regulator. Popular
ﬁxed negative-output voltage three-terminal regulators include LM/MC 79XX-series and LM 120-
XX/320-XX series. LM137/237/337 is a common adjustable negative output voltage regulator. The two-
digit number in place of ‘XX’ indicates the regulated output voltage.
Figure 6.19 shows the basic application circuits using LM/MC 78XX-series and LM/MC 79XX-series
three-terminal regulators. C1 and C2 are decoupling capacitors. C1 is generally used when the regulator is
located far from the power supply ﬁlter. Typically, a 0.22 mF ceramic disc capacitor is used for C1. C2 is
typically a 0.1 mF ceramic disc capacitor. LM 140XX/340XX series and LM 120XX/320XX series
regulators are also used in the same manner. In the case of ﬁxed-output voltage three-terminal regulators,
if instead of being grounded the common terminal was applied a DC voltage, the regulated output voltage

would be greater than the expected value by a quantum equal to the voltage applied to the common
terminal. For details on the salient features and performance speciﬁcations of three-terminal regulators
and their application circuits, refer to the data sheets and application notes provided by manufacturers of
these devices.
6.3
Switched-mode Power Supplies
Based on the regulation concept, power supplies are classiﬁed as either linear or switched-mode.
Conventional AC/DC power supplies comprising a transformer, rectiﬁer, ﬁlter and regulator (series or
shunt type) constitute the linear power supply. The active device in the regulator circuit of a linear power
supplyisalways operatedinthe active orlinear regionofitsoutputcharacteristics.Any change inthe output
voltage due to a change in the input voltage or load current results in a change in the voltage drop across the
regulator transistor (in the case of a series regulator) or a change in the current through the regulator
transistor (in the case of a shunt regulator), in order to maintain a constant output voltage across the load.
DC/DC converters and DC/AC inverters are members of the switched-mode power supply (SMPS)
category. There are also switching supplies which operate from AC mains, referred to as off-line
switching supplies. An off-line switching supply can be distinguished from a conventional AC/DC
supply as the AC mains is rectiﬁed and ﬁltered without using an input transformer in the former. The DC
voltage so obtained is then used as input to a switching-type DC/DC converter.
In a switching power supply, the active device that provides regulation is always operated in the
switched mode, that is, it is operated either in the cut-off or saturation region of the output characteristics.
The input DC is chopped at a high frequency (typically 10–100 kHz) using an active device (bipolar
junction transistor, power metal-oxide semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor or MOSFET, insulated gate
bipolar transistor or IGBT or silicon-controlled rectiﬁer or SCR) and the converter transformer. The
transformed chopped waveform is rectiﬁed and ﬁltered. A sample of the output voltage is used as a
feedback signal for the drive circuit of the switching device to achieve regulation.
6.3.1
Linear versus Switched-mode Power Supplies
Linear power supplies are well known for their extremely good line and load regulation, low output
voltage ripple and almost negligible radio frequency interference (RFI) or electromagnetic interference
(EMI). Switching power supplies on the other hand have a much higher efﬁciency (typically 80–90%
compared to 50% in the case of linear supplies) and reduced size/weight for a given power-delivering
capability. Quite often, compactness and efﬁciency are two major selection criteria. An improved
efﬁciency and reduced size/weight are signiﬁcant when designing a power supply for a portable system,
particularly when there is a requirement for a number of different regulated output voltages. Also, unlike
linear supplies, efﬁciency in switching supplies is not reduced as the unregulated input to regulated
output differential becomes large.
Figure 6.19
Basic application circuits using three-terminal regulators.
Building Blocks of Laser Electronics
173

In portable systems operating from battery packs and requiring higher DC voltages for their operation,
the switching supply is the only option. We cannot use a linear regulator to change a given unregulated
input voltage to a higher regulated output voltage.
6.3.2
Different Types of Switched-mode Power Supplies
Switched-mode power supplies are designed in a variety of circuit conﬁgurations depending upon the
intended application. Almost all switching supplies belong to one of the following three broad
categories:
1. ﬂyback converters
2. forward converters
3. push-pull converters.
There are variations in the circuit conﬁguration within each of these categories of switched-mode
power supplies. For instance, in the category of ﬂyback converters, we have the self-oscillating and the
externally driven ﬂyback converters. Also within the category of externally driven ﬂyback converters,
there are isolation and non-isolation conﬁgurations as well as DC/DC and off-line ﬂyback converters.
Similarly, there are different circuit conﬁgurations within the other two categories of switching
supplies. Although these conﬁgurations differ to an extent, the basic operational principle and the design
criteria for different types belonging to one category remain more or less the same.
6.3.2.1
Flyback Converters
The self-oscillating ﬂyback DC/DC converter is the most basic converter based on the ﬂyback principle
(Figure 6.20). A switching transistor, a converter transformer, a fast recovery rectiﬁer and an output ﬁlter
capacitor make up a complete DC/DC converter. It is a constant output power converter.
Duringthe conduction time of theswitching transistor, thecurrent through thetransformer primary starts
ramping up linearly with a slope equal to Vin/Lp where Vin is the unregulated input voltage and Lp is the
inductance of the primary winding of the transformer. The voltages induced in the secondary and the
feedback windings make the fast recovery rectiﬁer reverse-biased and hold the conducting transistor ‘on’.
When the primary current reaches its peak value IP where the core begins to saturate, the current tends
to rise very sharply. This sharp rise in current cannot be supported by the ﬁxed base drive provided by the
feedback winding. As a result, the switching transistor begins to come out of saturation.
Figure 6.20
Self-oscillating ﬂyback converter.
174
Lasers and Optoelectronics

This is a regenerative process with the transistor being switched off. The magnetic ﬁeld produced by
the current ﬂowing in the primary winding collapses, thus reversing the polarities of the induced
voltages. The fast recovery rectiﬁer is forward biased and the stored energy is transferred to the capacitor
and the load through the secondary winding. Energy is therefore stored during the ON-time and
transferred during the OFF-time of the switching transistor.
The output capacitor supplies the load current during the ON-time of the transistor, when no energy is
being transferred from the primary side. It is a constant output power converter. The converter can deliver
an output power given by Equation 6.7:
PO ¼ 1
2 hLPI2
Pf
(6.7)
where LP is the primary inductance; IP is the peak value of primary current; f is the switching frequency;
and h is the conversion efﬁciency.
The output voltage reduces as the load increases and vice versa. Utmost care should be taken to ensure
that the load is not accidentally taken off the converter. In this case, the output voltage would rise without
limit until the converter components become damaged. It is suitable for low-output power applications
due to its inherent nature of operation, and may be used with advantage up to an output power of 150 W.
It is characterized by a high-output voltage ripple.
A variation of this circuit is the externally driven ﬂyback converter. Figure 6.21 shows the circuit
diagram of the basic externally driven ﬂyback type DC/DC converter. The basic principle remains the
same. Energy is stored during ON-time of the active device and transferred during OFF-time. The
feedback loop, consisting of a comparator and the resistance divider, provides the voltage sense as well as
some degree of regulation.
Extension of the converter circuit of Figure 6.21 is the externally driven ﬂyback converter with pulse
width modulation (PWM) control to achieve regulation, depicted in Figure 6.22. Pulse width modulation
is the most widely used control technique in conjunction with ﬂyback converters. As the load current
increases, the output voltage tends to fall. The PWM control senses the change and increases the ON-
time of the active device in order to increase the power-delivering capability (increased ON-time means
increased stored energy) and restores the output voltage. Similarly, an increase in the output voltage
causes a reduction in the ON-time of the active device.
Figure 6.21
Basic externally driven ﬂyback converter.

175

There are other control circuitries which provide regulation by changing the OFF-time rather than the
ON-time. A reduced OFF-time increases the drive frequency and hence the power-delivering capability
and vice versa.
A number of integrated circuits have been developed to provide drive and control functions for DC/DC
converters. Some of these ICs provide PWM control while others offer constant ON-time and variable
frequency operations. These ICs have built-in features such as over-voltage protection and current limit.
Such ICs (e.g. TL497, TL494, TL594 and SG3524 to name a few) have considerably simpliﬁed the drive
and control circuit design.
Most switching supplies used in consumer and industrial systems are off-line. Figure 6.23 shows an
off-line externally driven ﬂyback DC/DC converter. It is called off-line because the input voltage to the
transistor switch is developed right from the AC line without ﬁrst going through the 50/60 Hz
transformer. The bridge rectiﬁer and the ﬁlter capacitor accomplish this in the circuit of Figure 6.23.
The feedback loop in an off-line supply must have isolation so that the DC output is isolated from the AC
line. A small transformer or an opto-isolator usually accomplishes this. Most switching supplies are

required to produce more than one regulated DC voltage. Figure 6.24 shows an off-line multiple output
ﬂyback DC/DC converter.
If a more stringent regulation is required in respect of one or more outputs, a linear post-regulator can
be used as shown in Figure 6.25. Three-terminal IC regulators have been used here for this purpose.

Multi-output switching supply with post regulation.

177

6.3.2.2
Forward Converter
Forward converter is another popular switching supply conﬁguration. Figure 6.26 shows the basic circuit
diagram of an off-line forward converter. There are some fundamental differences between a ﬂyback
converter and a forward converter. In the case of the circuit diagram shown in Figure 6.26, when the
transistor Q1 is switched on the polarities of the transformer windings (as indicated by the position of
dots) are such that diode D5 is forward biased and diodes D6 and D7 are reverse biased. Most of the
energy in a forward converter is stored in the output inductor rather than the transformer primary used to
store energy in a ﬂyback converter. When the transistor switch is turned off, the magnetic ﬁeld collapses.
Diode D5 is reverse biased and diodes D6 and D7 are forward biased. As the current through an inductor
cannot change instantaneously, the output current continues to ﬂow through the output and the forward-
biased diode D6 provides the current path.
Unlike a ﬂyback converter, current ﬂows from the energy storage element during both halves of the
switching cycle. For the same output power, a forward converter therefore has much less output ripple
than a ﬂyback converter. Controlling the duty cycle of the transistor switch provides output regulation.
In the absence of the third winding and diode D7, a good fraction of energy stored in the transformer
primary is lost. This effect is more severe at higher switching frequencies. The third winding and the
forward-biased diode D7 return the energy, which would otherwise be lost, and reset the transformer core
after each operating cycle. This not only increases converter efﬁciency but also makes the converter
transformer core immune to saturation problems.
6.3.2.3
Push-pull Converter
A push-pull converter is the most widely used switching supply belonging to the family of forward
converters. There are several different circuit conﬁgurations within the push-pull converter subfamily.
These circuits differ only in the mode in which the transformer primary is driven. These include the
conventional two-transistor, one-transformer push-pull converter (both self-oscillating and extremely
driven type) two-transistor, two-transformer push-pull converter, half-bridge converter and full-bridge
converter.
Figure 6.27 shows the conventional self-oscillating type of push-pull converter. Its operation can be
explained by considering it equivalent to two alternately operating self-oscillating ﬂyback converters.
When transistor Q1 is in saturation, energy is stored in the upper half of the primary winding. When the
linearly rising current reaches a value where the transformer core begins to saturate the current tends to
rise sharply, which is not supported by a more or less ﬁxed base bias. The transistor starts to come out of
Figure 6.26
Forward converter.
178
Lasers and Optoelectronics

saturation. This is a regenerative process which leads to transistor Q1 being switched off and transistor Q2
being switched on. Transistors Q1 and Q2 therefore switch on and off alternately. When Q1 is on, energy
is being stored in the upper half of the primary winding. The energy stored in the immediately preceding
half cycle in the lower half of the primary winding (when transistor Q2 was on) is transferred. Energy is
therefore stored and transferred at the same time. The voltage across the secondary is a symmetrical
square waveform, which is then rectiﬁed and ﬁltered to obtain the DC output.
As the primary is centre-tapped, and only half of the primary winding is active at one time, the main
transformer is not utilized as well as in case of other forms of push-pull converter (e.g. half-bridge and
full-bridge converters). In a push-pull converter, switching transistors operate at collector stress voltages
of at least twice the DC input voltage. As a result, a push-pull converter is not a highly recommended
choice for off-line operation. A push-pull converter that has wider applications than its self-oscillating
counterpart is the externally driven push-pull converter. Figure 6.28 shows the block schematic
arrangement of externally driven push-pull converter. This has been possible due to the availability
of a variety of SMPS drive and control ICs.
Self-oscillating push-pull converters are frequently used along with a voltage multiplier chain to
design a high-voltage low-current power supply (Figure 6.29). This conﬁguration is particularly useful
Figure 6.27
Self-oscillating push-pull converter.

for designing helium-neon laser power supplies. The basic push-pull converter converts the low DC input
voltage to a stepped-up square waveform, which is then multiplied using a chain of diodes and
capacitors. Voltage multiplier circuits are discussed in detail in Chapter 8 on gas laser electronics.
In the self-oscillating two-transistor one-transformer push-pull converters, the transformer provides both
power transformation as well as power switching. This circuit has some disadvantages. Firstly, as the power
switching is carried out at output power levels, the converter efﬁciency lowers quite a bit in the case of a high
power converter. Secondly, the peak collector current depends upon the available basevoltage, transistor gain
and input characteristics and is dependenton load. As there is awidevariation in the inputcharacteristics from
device to device, the circuit performance depends upon the chosen device. The transformer core must also be
constructed of expensive square-loop material with a large maximum ﬂux density rating.
These problems are overcome in the two-transformer two-transistor push-pull converter (Figure 6.30).
Power switching is performed at base power level and the output transformer performs power

transformation only. Capacitors C1 and C2 are the speed-up capacitors (also known as commutating
capacitors) used to achieve a faster turn-off of the respective transistors.
The half-bridge converter shown in Figure 6.31 is recommended for high-power applications.
Transistors Q1 and Q2 operate alternately. The half-bridge converter has the advantage that it allows
the use of transistors with lower breakdown voltages.
The full-bridge converter as shown in Figure 6.32 has the advantage that the highest voltage any
transistor is subjected to is only Vin as opposed to 2Vin in the case of a push-pull converter. Due to reduce
voltage and stress on the transistors, a full-bridge converter offers a great reliability.
6.3.2.4
Switching Regulators
Commonly used switching regulator conﬁgurations include a step-down or buck regulator, step-up or
boost regulator and an inverting regulator. Figure 6.33 shows the basic buck regulator. It resembles the
conventional forward converter discussed in Section 6.3.2.2 except for the fact that it does not use a
transformer and there is no input–output isolation. Output voltage is always less than the input voltage

Full-bridge converter.

and is given by Equation 6.8:
VO ¼ DVin
(6.8)
where D is the duty cycle of the drive waveform to the transistor switch, deﬁned by Ton/T where Ton is the
on-time of the drive waveform and T is the period of the drive waveform.
Regulation is achieved by pulse width modulation of the transistor switch. It is a very popular circuit
conﬁguration for fabrication of high-efﬁciency three-terminal switching regulators.
The step-up switching regulator, also called the boost regulator (Figure 6.34), is based on the ﬂyback
principle. It resembles the basic ﬂyback converter except that it is of non-isolating type. The energy
storage and transfer element in this case is an inductor rather than a transformer. The energy is stored in
the magnetic ﬁeld of the inductor during the conduction time of the switching transistor. Energy stored is
equal to 0:5  ðLPI2
PÞ. As the diode is reverse biased during conduction, the energy cannot be transferred
Figure 6.33
Buck regulator.
Figure 6.34
Boost regulator.
182
Lasers and Optoelectronics

while it is being stored. When the switching transistor is driven to cut-off, the diode becomes forward
biased and the stored energy is delivered to the load along with the energy from the DC input voltage.
The voltage across the load equals the DC input voltage plus the voltage due to the energy stored in the
inductor. The output voltage in this case is given by Equation 6.9:
VO ¼
Vin
1  D
ð
Þ ¼ Vin
T
Toff
(6.9)
where D is the duty cycle and T is the total time period equal to Ton þ Toff.
The power output capability of this circuit is given by Equation 6.10:
PO ¼ 1
2 LPI2
Pf
(6.10)
where f is the switching frequency.
As the DC input voltage is not electrically isolated from the output, the output voltage in this case
cannot be exclusively determined from the power rating of the circuit.
An inverting regulator (Figure 6.35) is another circuit conﬁguration based on the ﬂyback converter
principle. For a positive input, it produces a negative output. Energy is stored in inductor L during the
conduction time of the transistor. The diode is reverse biased during this time period. The stored energy is
transferred during off-time. The circuit delivers a constant output power to the load. The output voltage is
given by Equation 6.11:
VO ¼ 

PORL
p

(6.11)
Regulation is achieved by controlling the duty cycle of the drive waveform. In the inverting regulator
conﬁguration, it is possible to have an output voltage that is either less than or greater than the input. It is
also sometimes referred to as a buck-boost regulator.
6.3.2.5
Three-terminal Switching Regulators
The basic step-down (buck) regulator of Figure 6.26 has been widely exploited in the form of a three-
terminal switching regulator. Figure 6.36 shows the typical circuit conﬁguration found inside such a
Figure 6.35
Inverting regulator.

regulator. Except for the switching transistor and the output inductor, all other component blocks are
integrated on the chip.
The output voltage is compared with a reference voltage and the difference is ampliﬁed to drive a pulse
width modulator, which in turn operates the switch. The three-terminal regulator can be used to construct
a step-down switching supply that works very well for a wide input voltage range (typical ratio of
maximum to minimum voltage is 4 : 1). Output power levels of 300 W are conveniently achievable.
6.3.3
Connecting Power Converters in Series
Power converters can generally be connected in series, but it is advisable to check the speciﬁcations of
the converters to be connected in series. It is possible that one output affects the feedback loop of another.
Another limitation on the series connection of the two converters is that the total output voltage of the
series-connected converters should not exceed the working breakdown voltage of any one of the power
converters.
In order to protect each output from the reverse voltage of the other output in the event of a shorted-
load condition, reverse-biased diodes may be connected across the output of each series-connected
converter as shown in Figure 6.37. Series connection can be used to obtain a higher output voltage. In a
typical application, a dual output supply can be series connected to realize a single-ended supply with
double output voltage (Figure 6.38).
6.3.4
Connecting Power Converters in Parallel
Power converters should be connected in parallel only when they have been speciﬁcally designed for that
purpose or when the manufacturer recommends a parallel operation. The biggest problem in parallel

Series connection of power converters.
Figure 6.36
Three-terminal switching regulator.
184
Lasers and Optoelectronics

connection of two converters arises from unequal load sharing, which occurs as a result of output
voltages not being precisely equal. The converter with the greater output voltage will tend to provide the
entire load current. Even if the output voltages are adjusted to be precisely equal, a difference in the
output impedance and also its drift with time and temperature will cause the loads to become imbalanced.
One method used to overcome this unequal load sharing is to use small individual series resistors as
shown in Figure 6.39. While this type of parallel connection could be useful in some applications, it must
be borne in mind that the series resistors degrade the output regulation seriously. Also, the circuit will
always have a current imbalance. If the two converters in Figure 6.39 had a nominal output voltage of
5 V, a 50 mV difference in the output voltages may cause a current imbalance of 25%. In such a case, each
supply should not be capable of providing just 50% of the load current, but 75% of it.
A good reason for parallel connection of power converters is to provide redundancy. The output may
be connected in parallel through two diodes (Figure 6.40). For 100% redundancy, each power converter
must be capable of supplying the total load. In this case it does not matter whether the load is shared
equally or not, although it is desirable that each output provides at least a part of the load current.

The diodes permit one output to fail without affecting the other, which continues to supply the power to
the load. Such a system is useful in applications where power supply failure is not tolerable, or where a
high degree of reliability is required. If one of the power converters is replaced by a DC battery source of
the same voltage, it becomes an uninterrupted DC power supply (Figure 6.41).
6.4
Constant Current Sources
A constant current source delivers a predeﬁned constant current to a load despite variations in the supply
voltage and the load resistance. In this section, we shall discuss some common constant current sources
conﬁgured around active devices; a constant current source is an important building block of diode laser
electronics.
6.4.1
Junction Field-effect-transistor-based Constant Current Source
A junction ﬁeld-effect transistor (JFET) with a constant gate-source voltage acts like a constant source if
the drain-source voltage is greater than the pinch-off voltage. This is evident from the drain current
versus drain voltage characteristics of the JFET. Figure 6.42 shows the drain current versus drain voltage
characteristics of a typical N-channel JFET. In the saturation region, the drain current is almost
independent of the drain-source voltage. For a gate-source voltage of zero, the drain current is a
maximum IDSS. In the case of a JFET used as a constant current source, if gate terminal were shorted to
the source terminal the constant current obtained would be IDSS.
Current regulating diodes are simply JFETs with gate terminal internally shorted to source terminal.
Figure 6.43 shows the internal circuit of a current regulating diode. Inclusion of source resistor RS as
shown in Figure 6.43 allows the magnitude of constant current to be tuned to the desired value.

6.4.2
Transistor-based Constant Current Source
Figure 6.44 shows a simple constant current source conﬁgured around a bipolar transistor. The base
voltage of the bipolar transistor (equal to the breakdown voltage of the Zener diode, VZ) and hence its
emitter voltage (equal to VZ  VBE, where VBE is base to emitter voltage) remain constant irrespective of
the supply voltage variations as long as current through the Zener diode is more than a certain minimum
value. Resistor R1 supplies both the Zener diode current as well as the base current for the transistor.
Current through resistor R2 is given by ðVZ  VBEÞ=R2. Since VBE (typically 0.6–0.7 V for a silicon
transistor) is also constant for a given temperature, emitter current is constant. If the hFE of the transistor
is sufﬁciently large, emitter current is nearly equal to the collector current or the load current. The load
current in the circuit of Figure 6.44 is therefore constant irrespective of the variations in the load
resistance value and the supply voltage. The circuit behaves as constant current source. Varying R2
changes the value of the constant current.

In the circuit of Figure 6.44, the load current is likely to vary with changes in the operating temperature
due to temperature dependence of VBE. This can be taken care of by connecting a diode (made of the
same semiconductor material as the transistor) in series with the Zener diode as shown in Figure 6.45. In
this case, the emitter current equals ðVZ þ VD  VBEÞ=R2, which equals VZ=R2 for VD ¼ VBE. Another
possible circuit conﬁguration makes use of a light-emitting diode (LED) in place of a Zener diode
(Figure 6.46). This conﬁguration has the advantage that the voltage across the LED tracks the variation in
VBE due to change in temperature, thus eliminating the need for the series-connected diode. The emitter
current and hence the load current in this case can be computed from ðVLED  VBEÞ=R2.

Opamp-controlled Constant Current Source
Another constant current source that holds promise is conﬁgured around an operational ampliﬁer
(opamp); Figure 6.47 depicts such a circuit. The non-inverting terminal of the opamp is applied a
constant reference voltage. The opamp output drives the transistor to conduction and, due to virtual earth
phenomenon, the voltage at the inverting input of the opamp and hence across the sense resistor Rsense
equals the reference voltage. The constant current through the load resistance then equals VZ=Rsense and
is independent of VBE of the transistor.

Constant Current Source Using Three-terminal Regulators
Fixed- and adjustable-output three-terminal IC voltage regulators can be conveniently used to construct
constant current sources. Figure 6.48 shows the basic circuit. The load current in this case is given by

6.4.5
Current Mirror Conﬁgurations
A current mirror circuit mirrors or copies the current ﬂowing through an active device by controlling the
current ﬂowing through another active device. Conceptually, an ideal current mirror is simply an ideal
current ampliﬁer with a unity gain. There are various current mirror circuits exploited for designing
constant current sources. The basic current mirror circuits and the variations to the basic current mirror,
including Widlar and Wilson current sources, are described in the following sections.
6.4.5.1
Basic Current Mirror
Figure 6.49 shows the basic current mirror circuit. If the two transistors were perfectly matched, they
could be assumed to have the same values of base-emitter voltage drops and DC current gains. This is
possible to achieve when the two transistors are fabricated on the same IC chip at the same time.
Transistor Q1 with its collector terminal shorted to its base-terminal is wired like a diode. A
semiconductor diode has not been used as that would have made the matching of characteristics of
the diode and the base-emitter junction diode of the transistor Q2 difﬁcult to achieve. With the help of
simple mathematics, it can be proved that current I ﬂowing through Q2 equals the current IN ﬂowing
through R1.
Since the two transistors have identical values of DC current gain b and base current IB, they would
have identical collector and emitter currents as shown in Figure 6.49. Since
IIN ¼ I þ 2I=b
ð
Þ ¼

I ﬃI;
the current IIN set by VCC and R1 is mirrored as the collector current of Q2. It may be mentioned here that
more than one matched transistor can be connected to the base of Q1. The current through the collector of
each of the transistors equals the current ﬂowing through the collector of the left-half transistor. The
higher the value of b, the closer the mirrored current approximates the set value. Figure 6.50 shows
another current mirror circuit in which a JFET current-regulating diode sets the constant current. The set

value of current in this case is IDSS, which means that I ¼ IDSS. It may be mentioned here that in the
circuit arrangement of Figure 6.49, current through R1 would vary with variation in the supply voltage
with the result that the current I though a mirror image of current IIN will not be constant. The current
mirror conﬁguration of Figure 6.50 where transistor Q1 is driven by a constant current source overcomes
this problem.
6.4.5.2
Widlar Current Source
A constant current source should ideally have an inﬁnite incremental output impedance. AWidlar current
source as shown in Figure 6.51 is an improvement over the basic current mirror circuits of Figures 6.49
and 6.50, and offers much higher incremental output impedance. This is achieved by connecting a
resistor (R2 in this case) in series with the emitter terminal of Q2. This resistor introduces a current
feedback around Q2, thus increasing its output impedance by a factor (1 þ G) where G is the loop gain
deﬁned by 1 þ gm2R2 where gm2 is the transconductance of Q2. In order to have a constant load current,
the circuit must be driven by a constant current rather than R1.
6.4.5.3
Wilson Current Source
As shown in Figure 6.52, a Wilson current source has the advantage of virtually eliminating the base
current mismatch of the conventional current mirror conﬁguration. The other advantage is its higher
output impedance.
6.5
Integrated-circuit Timer Circuits
In this section, we shall discuss IC-based timer circuits conﬁgured around digital integrated circuits such
as the 74 121 from the TTL family and linear IC timers such as the IC timer 555.
6.5.1
Digital IC-based Timer Circuits
Some of the commonly used digital ICs that can be used as monostable multivibrators include the 74121
(single monostable multivibrator), 74221 (dual monostable multivibrator), 74122 (single retriggerable
monostable multivibrator) and the 74123 (dual retriggerable monostable multivibrator) of the TTL

family and the 4098B (dual retriggerable monostable multivibrator) of the CMOS family. Figure 6.53
shows the use of IC 74121 as a monostable multivibrator along with trigger input. The IC provides
features for triggering on either LOW-to-HIGH or HIGH-to-LOW edges of the trigger pulses.
Figures 6.53a and 6.53b show a possible application circuits for HIGH-to-LOW and LOW-to-HIGH
edge triggering, respectively. Output pulse width depends on external R and C. The output pulse width T

can be computed from T ¼ 0:7RC. Recommended ranges of values for R and C are 4–40 kV and 10 pF to
1000 mF, respectively. IC provides complementary outputs, that is, we have stable LOW or HIGH state
and corresponding HIGH or LOW state available on Q and Q outputs.
Figure 6.54 shows the use of 74123, a retriggerable monostable multivibrator. Like 74121, this IC also
provides features for triggering on either LOW-to-HIGH or HIGH-to-LOW edges of the trigger pulses.

C > 1000 pF. The recommended range of values for R is 5–50 kV. Figure 6.54a and b depict application
circuits for HIGH-to-LOWand LOW-to-HIGH triggering, respectively. It should be mentioned that there
are other triggering circuit options for both LOW-to-HIGH and HIGH-to-LOW edge-triggering of
monoshot.
6.5.2
IC Timer-based Multivibrators
IC timer 555 is one of the most commonly used general-purpose linear integrated circuits. The simplicity
with which monostable and astable multivibrator circuits can be conﬁgured around this IC is one of the
main reasons for its wide use. Figure 6.55 shows the internal schematic of timer IC 555. It comprises two
opamp comparators, a ﬂip-ﬂop, a discharge transistor, three identical resistors and an output stage. The
resistors set the reference voltage levels at the non-inverting input of the lower comparator and inverting
input of the upper comparator at þ VCC/3 and þ2 VCC/3, respectively. Outputs of two comparators feed

the SETand RESET input of the ﬂip-ﬂop and determine the logic status of its output and subsequently the
ﬁnal output. The ﬂip-ﬂop’s complementary outputs feed the output stage and the base of the discharge
transistor. This ensures that the output is HIGH when the discharge transistor is OFF, and LOW when the
discharge transistor is ON. Different terminals of the timer 555 are designated as Ground (Pin 1), Trigger
(Pin 2), Output (Pin 3), RESET (Pin 4), Control (Pin 5), Threshold (Pin 6), Discharge (Pin 7) and þVCC
(Pin 8). With this background, we shall now describe the astable and monostable circuits conﬁgured
around timer 555.
6.5.2.1
Astable Multivibrator Using Timer IC 555
Figure 6.56 depicts the basic 555 timer-based astable multivibrator circuit along with relevant waveforms.
Initially, capacitor C is fully discharged, which forces output to go to the HIGH state. An open discharge
transistor allows the capacitor C to charge from þVCC through R1 and R2. When the voltage across C
exceeds þ2VCC/3, the output goes to the LOW state and the discharge transistor is switched ON at the same
time. Capacitor C begins to discharge through R2 and the discharge transistor inside the IC. When the
voltage across C falls below þVCC/3, output goes back to HIGH state. The charge and discharge cycles
repeat and the circuit behaves like a free-running multivibrator. Terminal4 of theIC is the RESET terminal,
which is usually connected to þVCC. If thevoltage at this terminal is driven below 0.4V, output is forced to
the LOW state overriding command pulses at terminal 2 of the IC. The HIGH-state and LOW-state time
periods are governed by the charge þVCC/3 to þ2VCC/3 and discharge þ2VCC/3 to þVCC/3 timings.
HIGH-state time period THIGH ¼ 0:69C R1 þ R2
ð
Þ
LOW-state time period TLOW ¼ 0:69R2C
Remember that when the astable multivibrator is powered, the ﬁrst cycle HIGH-state time duration
is about 30% longer as the capacitor is initially discharged and it charges from 0 (rather than þVCC/3)
to þ2VCC/3.

In the case of the astable multivibrator circuit of Figure 6.56a, the HIGH-state time period is always
greater than the LOW-state time period. Figure 6.57 depicts the modiﬁed circuit where HIGH-state and
LOW-state time periods can be chosen independently. For the astable multivibrator circuit of Figure 6.57,
the two time periods are given by:
HIGH-state time period THIGH ¼ 0:69R1C
LOW-state time period TLOW ¼ 0:69R2C
for R1 ¼ R2 ¼ R; T ¼ 1:38RC and f ¼ ð1=1:38RCÞ:
6.5.2.2
Monostable Multivibrator Using Timer IC 555
Figure 6.58a shows the basic monostable multivibrator circuit conﬁgured around timer 555 along with
relevant waveforms as shown in Figure 6.58b. Trigger pulse is applied to pin 2 of the IC, which should
initially be kept at þVCC. A HIGH at pin 2 forces the output to LOW state. A HIGH-to-LOW trigger
pulse at pin 2 sets the output in the HIGH state and simultaneously allows the capacitor C to charge from
þVCC through R. Remember that the LOW-level of the trigger pulse needs to go at least below þVCC/3.
When the capacitor voltage exceeds þ2VCC/3, the output goes back to the LOW state. We need to apply
Building Blocks of Laser Electronics
195

another trigger pulse to pin 2 to make the output return to the HIGH state. Every time the timer is
appropriately triggered, the output goes to the HIGH state and stays there for the time taken by the
capacitor to charge from 0 to þ2VCC/3. This time period, which equals the monoshot output pulse width,
is given by T ¼ 1:1RC.
It is often desirable to trigger a monostable multivibrator either on the trailing (HIGH-to-LOW) or
leading edges (LOW-to-HIGH) of the trigger waveform. In order to achieve that, we need an external
circuit between the trigger waveform input and pin 2 of timer 555. The external circuit ensures that pin 2
of the IC gets the required trigger pulse corresponding to the desired edge of the trigger waveform.
Figure 6.59a shows the monoshot conﬁguration that can be triggered on the trailing edges of the trigger
waveform. Figure 6.59b shows relevant waveforms. R1–C1 constitutes a differentiator circuit. One of the
terminals of resistor R1 is tied to þVCC with the result that the amplitudes of differentiated pulses are
þVCC to þ2VCC and þVCC to ground, corresponding to the leading and trailing edges of the trigger
waveform, respectively. Diode D clamps the positive-going differentiated pulses to about þ0.7 V.
Figure 6.58

Lasers and Optoelectronics

The net result is that the trigger terminal of timer 555 gets the required trigger pulses corresponding to the
HIGH-to-LOW edges of the trigger waveform.
Figure 6.60a shows the monoshot conﬁguration that can be triggered on the leading edges of the
trigger waveform and Figure 6.60b shows the relevant waveforms. The R1–C1 combination constitutes
the differentiator producing positive and negative pulses corresponding to LOW-to-HIGH and HIGH-to-
LOW transitions of the trigger waveform. Negative pulses are clamped by the diode and the positive
pulses are applied to the base of a transistor switch. The collector-terminal of the transistor feeds the
required trigger pulses to pin 2 of the IC.
For the circuits shown in Figures 6.59 and 6.60 to function properly, values of R and C for the
differentiator should be chosen carefully. Firstly, the differentiator time constant should be much smaller
than the HIGH time of the trigger waveform for proper differentiation. Secondly, differentiated pulse
width should be less than the expected HIGH time of the monoshot output.
6.6
Current-to-voltage Converter
There are many situations where the signal of interest is current rather than voltage. As an example, the
electrical signal produced by a photosensor as a result of light falling on it is a current. In order to process
the signal to extract the intended information, more often than not the current needs to be converted into
an equivalent voltage. This function is performed with a current-to-voltage converter circuit, which is
also known as transimpedance ampliﬁer for obvious reasons. Figure 6.61 shows the basic opamp-based
current-to-voltage converter fed at its input by a current source I. The analysis of the circuit is very
simple. Since the non-inverting input of the opamp is tied to ground and the circuit has negative feedback
Figure 6.59
555-timer monostable conﬁguration triggering on high-to-low edges.
Building Blocks of Laser Electronics
197

due to virtual earth phenomenon, the inverting input also behaves as if it were grounded. In fact, the
high open loop gain of the opamp coupled with negative feedback forces the two inputs to remain at
the same potential for a ﬁnite output. With this background, the magnitude of current ﬂowing through the
feedback resistor R would be VO/R. Since no current ﬂows into the opamp due to its inﬁnite input
impedance (under ideal conditions), applying Kirchoff’s current law at the inverting terminal node yields
I þ VO=R
ð
Þ ¼ 0 which gives VO ¼ IR.
A current-to-voltage converter constitutes an important building block of laser electronics. All laser
receiver circuits, light meters, laser rangeﬁnders, laser warning sensors and laser communication

Lasers and Optoelectronics

receivers use some kind of photosensor. The desired information is in the form of a continuous or pulsed
electric current, which needs to be converted into an equivalent voltage signal for further processing. A
current-to-voltage converter circuit is therefore invariably used as a front end in all laser detection
systems. Figure 6.62 shows the basic current-to-voltage converter fed at its input from a photodiode. The
photodiode here is used in photovoltaic mode, that is, the bias voltage is zero. More current-to-voltage
converter circuits that convert photodiode current into an equivalent voltage are discussed in Chapter 10
on photosensors.
6.7
Peak Detector
A peak detector produces at its output a voltage equal to the peak value of the signal applied at its input.
The circuit could be designed to detect either the positive or the negative peak. Figure 6.63 shows a
typical positive peak detector circuit. In the case of negative peak detector circuit, polarity of the diode is
reversed. The circuit functions as described below.
In the case of a sinusoidal input or any other bi-directional input, the diode is forward biased during the
positive half-cycles. The capacitor rapidly charges to the positive peak from the output of the opamp
through relatively much smaller ON-resistance of the forward-biased diode. In the case of a positive
pulse input, the same happens during the duration of the pulse. As the input begins to decrease beyond the
peak value the diode becomes reverse biased, thus isolating the capacitor from the output of the opamp.
The capacitor can discharge only through the parallel combination of the two resistors. One of these is
the resistor connected across the capacitor and the other is the series combination of the feedback resistor
and the input resistor of the opamp at the inverting input. This effective discharge path resistance is
relatively much larger than the ON-resistance of the forward-biased diode. It may be mentioned here that

Positive-peak detector circuit.

the resistor across the capacitor is there to allow a discharge path for the circuit to respond to the
decreasing amplitude of the signal peaks. The unity gain buffer at the output is to prevent capacitor
discharge due to the loading effects of the following circuit.
The parallel R–C circuit time constant is typically 100 times the time period corresponding to
minimum frequency of operation. The R–C time constant also controls the response time to changing
amplitude; higher R–C time constant gives lower ripple but a sluggish response while a lower R–C time
constant gives a faster response at the cost of increased ripple. The chosen value is a trade-off between
two conﬂicting requirements.
Slew rate is the main opamp parameter to be considered while choosing an opamp for this application.
The desired slew rate should be such that the slew-rate-limited frequency, which is a function of the peak-
to-peak output swing and the slew rate, is at least equal to the highest frequency of operation. Peak-to-
peak voltage swing at the output of the opamp is equal to VP  VSAT
ð
Þ ¼ VP þ VSAT. In the case of
pulse input, the slew rate should at least equal VO/T volts per microsecond. VP is the peak amplitude of
the pulse and T is its width.
As for a current-to-voltage converter, peak detector is also an important building block of laser
receiver electronics in systems such as laser warning sensors, laser power and energy meters. It is
particularly important while designing front-end detection circuits for Q-switched laser pulses. The peak
detector circuit in that case acts as a pulse stretcher. The peak of the stretched pulse equals the peak of the
input pulse. The stretched pulse allows the designer to use relatively lower speed processing circuitry
subsequent to the front-end. This is discussed further in Chapter 10 on photosensors and Chapter 14 on
military applications of lasers and optoelectronics.
6.8
High-voltage Trigger Circuit
A high-voltage trigger circuit is another important building block of laser electronics. It is an essential
component of the electronics package with any ﬂash-lamp-pumped solid-state laser, where it performs
the function of initiating an electrical discharge in the gas inside the tube to create a low resistance path
between the two electrodes. The amplitude of the high-voltage pulses is typically in the range 5–20 kV
and the pulse shape is not critical. High-voltage pulses are also required to operate the Q-switch in the
case of electro-optically Q-switched solid-state lasers. The amplitude of the high-voltage pulse required
for the Q-switch is typically of the order 2–3 kVand the pulse has a well-deﬁned shape in terms of its rise
time and pulse width.
Figure 6.64a shows a typical high-voltage trigger pulse generation circuit used for ﬂash lamp
triggering. A bipolar junction transistor, an enhancement MOSFETor an insulated gate bipolar transistor

Lasers and Optoelectronics

(IGBT) can also be used as the electronic switch in place of SCR. When the SCR is in the OFF-state,
capacitor C charges through resistor R and the transformer primary. When the capacitor is fully charged
to the applied DC voltage V, the SCR is triggered to the ON-state by application of a suitable trigger
pulse at its gate-terminal. The capacitor rapidly discharges through the primary winding of the
transformer, generating a pulse across the primary winding. This pulse is stepped up to produce the
desired amplitude of high voltage pulse across the secondary winding. The polarity of the pulse depends
upon the winding polarity. In the case of the circuit shown in Figure 6.64a, the polarity of the pulse at the
dotted end of the primary winding is negative which means that the polarity of the pulse on the dotted end
of the secondary winding will also be negative. As a result, we get a positive polarity output pulse.
Figure 6.64b shows the relevant waveforms.
Value of resistance R should be such that the current V/R is less than the holding current value of the
SCR. Otherwise, once turned ON, the SCR will continue to conduct even after the capacitor has fully
discharged through it and the primary winding. Figure 6.65a and b show the same circuit implemented
with an N-channel enhancement MOSFETand relevant waveforms. Note that in the case of circuit Given
that the Doppler-broadened gain curve of a helium-neon laser with a 50-cm-long resonator emitting at
1.15 mm is 770 MHz, determine (a) inter-longitudinal mode spacing and (b) the number of maximum
possible sustainable longitudinal modes of Figure 6.65a, the value of resistance R has no lower limit as in
the case of an SCR circuit. In the case of a MOSFET-based trigger circuit, MOSFET remains ON during
the duration of the input pulse and the capacitor starts charging only after the MOSFET goes back to the
OFF-state. The IGBT-based circuit functions similarly to the MOSFET-based circuit.

Summary
 Power supply is an essential building block of all laser electronics packages. It does the job of
providing required DC voltages from available AC mains (for mains-operated systems) and DC input
(for portable systems). Power supplies are often classiﬁed as linear power supplies or switched-mode
power supplies, depending upon the nature of regulation circuit.
 A linear power supply comprises: a mains transformer, a rectiﬁer circuit, a ﬁlter circuit and a
regulation circuit.
Figure 6.65
MOSFET-based high-voltage trigger circuit.
202
Lasers and Optoelectronics

 The transformer transforms the mains AC input to the desired value of AC. The rectiﬁer circuit converts
the AC into a unidirectional waveform. The ﬁlter smoothes the ripple and the regulator circuit ensures
that the load voltage (in the case of voltage-regulated power supplies) or the load current (in the case of
current-regulated power supplies) is constant irrespective of variations in line voltage or load resistance.
 There are three basic types of linear voltage regulator conﬁgurations: emitter-follower regulator, series
regulator and shunt regulator. For an emitter-follower regulator, the emitter voltage (which is also the
output voltage) remains constant as long as the base voltage is held constant. A Zener diode connected
at the base ensures this. For a series linear regulator, the pass element is connected in series with the
load and any decrease or increase in the output voltage is accompanied by a decrease or increase in the
collector-emitter voltage of the series-pass transistor. A shunt regulator provides a change in the
current through the shunt transistor, thereby changing the voltage drop across a series-connected
resistor to maintain a constant output voltage.
 Contemporary regulating circuits are almost exclusively conﬁgured around one or more ICs known as IC
voltageregulators.ICvoltageregulatorsareavailabletomeetawiderangeofoutputvoltageandloadcurrent
requirements. Both ﬁxed-output voltage (positive and negative) and adjustable-output voltage (positive and
negative) IC regulators are commercially available in a wide range of voltage, current and regulation
speciﬁcations. These have built-in protection features such as current limit and thermal shutdown.
 Linear power supplies are well known for their extremely good line and load regulation, low output
voltage ripple and almost negligible RFI/EMI. Switching power supplies on the other hand have much
higher efﬁciency (typically 80–90% compared to 50% in the case of linear supplies) and reduced
size/weight for a given power-delivering capability.
 Switched-mode power supplies are designed in a variety of circuit conﬁgurations depending upon the
intended application. Almost all switching supplies belong to one of the following three broad
categories: ﬂyback converters, forward converters and push-pull converters.
 A constant current source delivers a predeﬁned constant current to a load despite variations in supply
voltage and load resistance. There are various constant current source conﬁgurations using JFETs,
bipolar junction transistors and operational ampliﬁers. In addition, there are mirror-based constant
current source conﬁgurations.
 Timer circuits can be designed with the help of general-purpose digital integrated circuits and linear
integrated circuits.
 A current-to-voltage converter is an important component of laser electronics where the desired
information is in the form of a continuous or pulsed electric current which needs to be converted into
an equivalent voltage signal for further processing. All laser receiver circuits, light meters, laser
rangeﬁnders, laser warning sensors and laser communication receivers use some kind of photosensor.
 A peak detector is an important component of laser receiver electronics in systems such as laser
warning sensors, laser power and energy meters. It is particularly important while designing detection
circuits for Q-switched laser pulses. Peak detector circuits to detect either positive or negative peak
can also be conﬁgured around simple operational ampliﬁer circuits.
 A high-voltage trigger circuit is an essential component of the electronics package that accompanies
any ﬂash-lamp-pumped solid-state laser, where it performs the function of initiating an electrical
discharge in the gas inside the tube to create a low-resistance path between the two electrodes.

Solid-state Laser Electronics
7.1
Introduction
There has been a dramaticincrease incommercial, industrial, medical,defenceandresearchapplications of
lasers sincetheearly 2000s.Avariety oflasers covering a largeportionof the electromagnetic spectrumand
producing a range of output power levels are available at affordable prices. Signiﬁcant developments have
also been made in the ﬁeld of laser- or laser-based-system electronics. The role of an electronics engineer
working in the ﬁeld of lasers is far more challenging today than it was in the early stages of development of
lasers. In this chapter and in Chapters 8 and 9 the electronics component of different types of laser sources
and the systems built around them are discussed. After a brief introduction to the wide spectrum of
electronics circuits that form part of various laser and optoelectronics systems, the design and operational
aspects of electronics that accompany solid-state lasers are described. Electronics packages for gas lasers
and semiconductor lasers are discussed in Chapters 8 and 9, respectively.
7.2
Spectrum of Laser Electronics
In this section we brieﬂy outline the role of electronics in lasers, laser-based systems and optoelectronic
systems. With reference to laser sources and laser-based systems, we usually talk about only those
subsystems that are essential from the operational viewpoint of the laser in question. However, if we
conﬁned the discussion only to power supplies for different types of lasers, then we would probably only
be covering 30% of the electronics that concerns contemporary lasers and laser-based systems. In the
following sections, we shall brieﬂy look at the range of electronics circuitry that accompany solid-state,
semiconductor diode and gas lasers. In addition to the signiﬁcant role that the electronics plays in the
case of laser sources and systems conﬁgured around them, electronics also plays a major role in the
design and development of optoelectronic systems related to the testing and evaluation of laser systems
and optoelectronic sensor systems. Systems used for testing and evaluation include those used for
measurement of different laser source parameters such as pulse energy, CW power and beam divergence
as well as the operational parameters of the laser system such as power/energy density or the beam proﬁle
at a certain distance from the laser source. Optoelectronic sensor systems are generally used for the
detection of laser radiation along with other parameters, including laser warning, laser position sensing
and laser guidance, depending on the application in question.
7.2.1
Solid-state Lasers
Let us take the case of a ﬂashlamp-pumped pulsed solid-state laser such as Nd:YAG or Nd:Glass. When
discussing an electronics package for such a laser source, it is the power supply unit needed to charge the
energy storage capacitor to store the requisite quantum of energy that comes to mind ﬁrst. It is not only

the most complex of the electronics circuit modules used in the case of ﬂashlamp-pumped solid-state
lasers; its electrical conversion efﬁciency plays a key role in determining the wall-plug efﬁciency and the
size/weight of the laser. Capacitor-charging power supplies intended for ﬂashlamp-pumped solid-state
laser applications are commercially available both as bench-top models as well as modular units for
original equipment manufacturers (OEM) applications. These capacitor-charging power supplies are
available for a range of input voltage (AC or DC), DC output voltage and charging rate speciﬁcations. DC
output voltage from a few hundreds of volts to several kilovolts and charging rate in the range of tens–
thousands of joules per second are common. In addition, these power supplies offer many control and
protection features relevant to ﬂashlamp-pumped laser power supplies. Some of these features include
end-of-charge status indication, peak output voltage hold, output voltage monitor and over voltage and
over temperature protection. Figure 7.1 depicts one such capacitor-charging power supply suitable for
ﬂashlamp-pumped solid-state lasers from Kaiser Systems, Inc.
Less important are other circuit modules such as the simmer power supply, used in high-repetition-rate
ﬂashlamp-pumped solid-state lasers, the Q-switch driver, used in Q-switched lasers and the pulse-
forming network (PFN) that ensures a critically damped current pulse through the ﬂashlamp when the
energy storage capacitor is made to discharge through it. When the same laser is used as a source to build
a laser rangeﬁnder, a lot more is added to the electronics component of the overall system. In addition to
the circuit blocks outlined above, which constitute laser source electronics, the rangeﬁnder system also
needs to have a receiving channel capable of processing the laser pulses received after being scattered
from the intended target. Most military rangeﬁnders work on the time-of-ﬂight measurement principle
and compute the target range by measuring the time interval between the transmitted and the received
laser pulses. The receiving channel typically comprises circuit blocks such as low-noise optoelectronic
front-end, having the requisite bandwidth to process the received laser pulses, and high-speed counting
circuitry to determine the time interval and control logic.
7.2.2
Semiconductor Diode Lasers
As outlined in Chapter 5 during the discussion on the handling of diode lasers, it was emphasized that
certain guidelines needed to be strictly adhered to in both the handling of these lasers and in the design of
the driver and control circuits used to power them in order to achieve the prescribed life and reliability
performance. Diode lasers are particularly sensitive to electrostatic discharge, short-duration electric
transients such as current spikes, injection current exceeding the prescribed limit and reverse voltage
exceeding the breakdown limit.
In order to protect the diode lasers from the above-mentioned failure modes, the driver circuit should
be carefully designed and should have all the features recommended by the diode laser manufacturer.
The driver should be a constant current source with inbuilt features such as soft start, protection against
transients, interlock control for the connection cable to the laser and safe adjustable limit for injection
current. In case the laser is to be operated in the pulsed mode, the injection current should be pulsed
between two values above the lasing threshold rather than between cut-off and lasing mode.

When used in a laser printer, a laser pointer or even a compact disk player, a laser diode may need a
conventional constant current source without too stringent a requirement on the current stabilization to
do the job. Drive current and diode temperature stabilization to a high degree for stabilizing the output
wavelength become very important in applications such as telecommunication, spectroscopy and
biomedical diagnostics. The concepts of drive current and diode temperature stabilization have been
put to use very effectively in tuning the diode laser output wavelength also. In fact, it is the ability to
stabilize the parameter that allows it to be varied.
Leading manufacturers of diode lasers offer a wide range of current sources for low-, medium- and
high-power laser diodes to suit different requirements. Both general-purpose bench-top models and
modular units for OEM applications are commercially available from a fairly large number of
manufacturers. They also offer temperature controllers to stabilize the output wavelength. Figure 7.2
depicts a bench-top precision laser diode driver of LDX-3200 series from ILX Lightwave Optics. The
LDX-3200 series consists of laser diode drivers with current ranges of 50–100 mA (LDX-3210), 200–
500 mA (LDX-3220) and 2–4 A (LDX-3232) covering a wide range of laser diode drive and control
applications. The series offers operation in both constant current and constant power modes and has
inbuilt protection features including adjustable current and voltage limits and intermittent contact
protection. Also, output shorting relays are designed into each model. It may be mentioned here that
these are typical features in most diode laser drivers available from leading manufacturers.
Temperature controllers for diode laser temperature control are also available in a wide range of
performance parameters to suit different requirement speciﬁcations. Both bench-top units and OEM
modules are commercially available. Figure 7.3 depicts a typical bench-top thermoelectric laser diode
Figure 7.2

temperature controller of LDT-5900 series from ILX Light Wave Optics. These temperature controllers
are capable of operating in constant temperature, constant power or constant current modes with
temperature stability of better than 0.003 C. Integrated laser diode controllers offering both current
drive as well as thermoelectric temperature control in a single instrument are also commercially
available from a number of manufacturers.
7.2.3
Gas Lasers
A high-voltage DC power supply used to initiate and then sustain plasma is the electronics that
accompany a helium-neon (He-Ne) or a carbon dioxide (CO2) laser, although RF-excited versions of
these lasers are also available. Figure 7.4 shows the use of a high-voltage DC power supply along with a
He-Ne laser plasma tube. Figure 7.5 depicts He-Ne power supplies of 1200-series (Figure 7.5a) and
101T-series (Figure 7.5b) from JDS Uniphase. These power supplies are available in both 115–230 VAC
input and 12 V DC input versions.
The current stabilization that the He-Ne laser power supply needs to provide depends on the
intended application. There are applications where a high degree of current stabilization is not an
essential requirement. One such application is its use as an alignment laser. However, when it comes
to using the same laser in an inertial-grade rotation rate sensor such as a ring laser gyroscope (RLG),
Figure 7.5

the current would need to be stabilized to a level better than 100 parts per million (PPM). The drive
electronics in this case becomes fairly complex as is evident in Section 8.4.4. In addition, for such
applications frequency also needs to be stabilized better than 1 MHz on its Doppler-broadened gain
curve, that is, about 1400 MHz wide for 632.8 nm output wavelength. In fact, frequency stabilization
of gas lasers is a complete ﬁeld in itself. Scientists have worked in this area for decades to discover
new methods of stabilizing the laser frequency using active means or improve upon those already
existing. Different frequency stabilization schemes commonly used with gas lasers are also described
in Section 8.9.
7.2.4
Testing and Evaluation of Lasers
Measurement of laser parameters such as power, energy, pulse width and wavelength is yet another
area where electronics plays an important role. We have all kinds of lasers producing CW, pulsed or
Q-switched pulsed laser outputs. While we are mainly interested in the output power in CW lasers
such as gas lasers, it is the energy and the pulse width that is of interest in the case of pulsed lasers. In
case of Q-switched pulsed solid-state lasers, we need to measure energy per pulse, average power and
also the peak power. Testing and measuring equipment capable of measuring one or more of these
parameters are commercially available. The equipment usually comes in the form of a display unit
and a family of sensor heads to cater for different power level, pulse energy and wavelength range
requirements.
Figure 7.6 depicts a power/energy meter, model FieldMaxII-TOP from Coherent Inc. The meter is
used along with a thermopile and optical sensor heads for measurement of power and a pyroelectric
sensor head for measurement of pulse energy. The meter is capable of measuring CW power in the range
of 1 nW–300 mW with an optical sensor and 10 mW–30 kW with thermopile sensor. It can measure pulse
energy in the range of 1 nJ–300 J up to a maximum repetition rate of 300 Hz with a pyroelectric sensor.
All parameters are measured with a resolution of 0.1% of full scale.
Although the above diagnostic gadgets are commercially available, this does not mean that the
designers of laser electronics packages do not need to know anything about the design of such gadgets.
There are a large variety of laser systems where measurement of laser power or energy forms an integral
part of the total system. Commercially available testing and measurement instruments are certainly of
immense use during the development phase of a laser system and also during the performance evaluation
of the ﬁnished system. It is highly likely that the designers of laser electronics packages will encounter
situations where they would be required to design dedicated power- or energy-measuring subsystems
that are a part of the overall system. As an example, the Nd:YAG laser system meant for eye care
invariably has an energy meter as an integral part of the system. The energy-measuring subsystem here
forms a critical part of the system due to the importance of knowing the selected energy level for various
surgical exercises. As another example, in the case of a laser diode or a He-Ne laser where the laser
output power is to be maintained constant, part of the laser diode driver or power supply circuit monitors
the output power and changes the drive current in a feedback loop in order to keep the laser power
constant.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

There are other areas of diagnostics where no commercially available gadgets can be used. One
such area is measurement of power density or energy density rather than power or energy. Such a
situation arises during the ﬁeld evaluation of the electro-optic countermeasure (EOCM) class of laser
systems, where the effect of the laser beam on the target sensor depends upon the energy/power
density available at the target location. It is important to measure the power/energy density parameters
as it is affected by atmospheric attenuation and also by increase in laser spot diameter due to beam
divergence.
Photosensors play a very important role in the design and development of diagnostic gadgets meant
for measurement of laser-related parameters. There is a large variety of such sensors catering to
different wavelength bands and different power and energy levels. Photosensors are covered in detail
in Chapter 10.
7.2.5
Laser Sensor Systems
In a large number of optoelectronic systems, in particular battleﬁeld optoelectronic systems, the primary
function is detection of laser radiation with or without its important parameters depending upon the
intended application. Such systems include laser warning sensors, laser position sensors and laser
seekers. A laser warning sensor system is an essential constituent of both passive and active EOCM
systems. Different battleﬁeld applications demand laser warning sensor systems with different functional
features, thus having different design complexities. In the simplest form, a laser warning sensor may be
required to give an indication of the existence of a laser threat without giving any information on the
direction of arrival of the threat. In another case, it may also have the direction-sensing feature with the
resolution of direction sensing also varying with the intended application. In addition, the operational
wavelength band may also vary from one application to another. More complex laser warning systems
indicate the type of laser threat, the wavelength and the direction of arrival of the threat with an angular
resolution approaching less than a degree. Figure 7.7 depicts such a sensor from Goodrich ISR. Different
variants of laser threat detection systems capable of characterizing threats from laser rangeﬁnders, laser
target designators and laser beam riders are available for mounting on helicopters, main battle tanks and
light armoured vehicles.
Laser position sensors have extensive application in laser-based research. A laser seeker, which is
also a kind of position sensor, is the heart of the guidance system of a laser-guided weapon such as a
laser-guided bomb or missile. Figure 7.8 a depicts a Raytheon’s GBU 24 Paveway-III class of laser-
guided bomb integrated with a laser seeker head. Figure 7.8b provides a close-up view of a gimballed
laser seeker head of the laser-guided bomb. Battleﬁeld laser sensor systems are discussed in detail in
Chapter 14.
7.3
Electronics for Solid-state Lasers
The most commonly used and widely exploited solid-state lasers include Nd:YAG and ND:Glass lasers.
These lasers are either ﬂashlamp pumped or pumped by semiconductor laser diode arrays. The
electronics for these two types of lasers are similar. The electronics required for diode-pumped
solid-state lasers is the same as used in the case of semiconductor diode lasers. In the following
sections the electronics package that accompanies ﬂashlamp-pumped pulsed and CW solid-state lasers is

discussed. The electronics components of diode-pumped solid-state lasers are not discussed under the
heading of solid-state lasers, but are covered under the heading of Laser Diode Electronics in Chapter 9.
7.4
Electronics for Pulsed Solid-state Lasers
Pulsed solid-state lasers are operated in either of the two basic operational modes: free-running and
Q-switched modes. When compared to a free-running laser, an electronics package for a Q-switched
laser has an additional Q-switch driver module. For cavity-dumped and mode-locked lasers, the
electronics package is similar to that of a free-running laser. In the following sections the electronics
package of a Q-switched ﬂashlamp-pumped solid-state laser is described, as this covers all operational
modes. The discussion begins with an introduction in the form of a block schematic of the electronics
package, and a brief outline of the functions of each of the modules with particular reference to the
importance of each module in the overall package. This is followed by a detailed description of each of
the important modules along with preferred schematic options and design guidelines.
7.4.1
Electronics for Q-switched Solid-state Lasers
Figure 7.9 shows the basic building blocks of an actively Q-switched, ﬂashlamp-pumped Nd:YAG or Nd:
Glass laser. AQ-switch driver is not required in the case of passive Q-switching, as is a simmer module in
the case of non-simmer mode operation. Figure 7.10 shows the block schematic arrangement in the case
of non-simmer mode of operation.
The heart of the system is the main power supply, which is invariably a switched mode used to charge an
energystoragecapacitortoavoltageinordertostoretherequiredquantumofenergyperpulsetobedeliveredto
the ﬂashlamp. The main power supply is also called the capacitor-charging power supply. The capacitor must

The conversion efﬁciency also directly affects the size and weight of the overall system, a parameter
particularly important in the military applications of Q-switched, ﬂashlamp-pumped solid-state lasers.

The simmer module maintains a relatively low-amplitude keep-alive current through the ﬂashlamp at
all times, irrespective of whether the lamp is ﬂashing or not. The current varies typically from a few tens
of milliamperes to several hundreds of milliamperes depending upon the characteristics of the ﬂashlamp.
This mode of operation, referred to as the simmer mode, has many advantages. From the operational
viewpoint, it allows a low-voltage (transistor–transistor logic or TTL, complementary metal oxide
semiconductor or CMOS, etc.) trigger pulse to be used to transfer the energy stored in the capacitor to the
ﬂashlamp. Secondly, it signiﬁcantly enhances the ﬂashlamp life, offers tremendous improvement on the
pulse-to-pulse jitter, and overcomes most of the electromagnetic interference problems present in non-
simmer mode of operation. It may be mentioned here that in the non-simmer mode of operation of the
ﬂashlamp, the ﬂashlamp is triggered by applying high-voltage trigger pulses with amplitude of the order
of 10–15 kV. These pulses appear at a rate equal to the repetition rate of the laser and are the major source
of electromagnetic interference. Operation in simmer mode overcomes this shortcoming.
There is also a pseudo simmer mode of operation, which is a slight variation from the traditional
simmer mode of operation. In this mode, the simmer current ﬂows for a short time, starting a little ahead
of the energy discharge operation. It has all the advantages of simmer mode operation but also saves on
the power at the expense of added circuit complexity. Simmer and pseudo-simmer modes of operation
are discussed in Sections 7.4.3 and 7.4.4, respectively.
A Q-switch driver is another important module for solid-state lasers and generates the drive signal for
electro-optic Q-switch. The driver needs to generate a high-voltage pulse with the desired amplitude
(typically 2.5–3.5 kV), pulse width that could be in the range of 200–500 ns and a rise time that should
not be more than a few tens of nanoseconds. These parameters signiﬁcantly affect the Q-switch
performance and consequently the shape of the Q-switched laser pulse.
The pulse-forming network (PFN) ensures that the discharge current pulse through the ﬂashlamp has
the desired pulse width and is critically damped, thus providing the optimum energy transfer. In this case,
the energy storage capacitor is exposed to the least voltage reversal while discharging through the
ﬂashlamp.
The command module generates ﬂashlamp-ﬁring command pulses and also the delayed trigger pulses
for the Q-switch driver module. It may be mentioned that Q-switch drive pulse is applied after a certain
time delay from the time instant of the application of the ﬂashlamp trigger command pulse, to allow for
the population inversion to build up to its peak value. The ﬂashlamp command pulses are low-voltage
pulses (TTL, CMOS etc.) in the case of simmer mode and high-voltage trigger pulses in the case of non-
simmer mode. The delayed trigger pulses for the Q-switch driver are always low-voltage pulses and the
Q-switch driver produces the desired high-voltage pulses for the electro-optic Q-switch. In addition,
there is an auxiliary module that generates the regulated low-voltage DC power supplies from the input
source of power for the operation of different circuit modules.
7.4.2
Capacitor-charging Power Supply
The power supply required to charge the energy storage capacitor is perhaps the most important of all the
modules. In addition, designing an efﬁcient capacitor-charging unit for a high-repetition-rate ﬂashlamp-
pumped laser is not so simple an exercise, as demonstrated in the following. The problem arises from the
capacitive nature of the load. The power supply output needs to charge a high-value capacitor, typically
20–50 mF in the case of designators and rangeﬁnders and as high as thousands of microfarads in high-
power pulsed lasers producing laser pulse energies of several kilojoules meant for electro-optic
countermeasures (EOCM) and laser weapon applications. In the following, we examine some circuit
conﬁgurations that could possibly be used for designing the capacitor-charging power supplies.
The simplest capacitor-charging power supply may be conﬁgured around a transformer-rectiﬁer
arrangement of an AC-DC power supply as shown in Figure 7.11. Resistor R1 is the current-limiting
resistor to limit the charging current at the start of the charging process when the energy storage capacitor
C1 is fully discharged. The semiconductor switch, typically an SCR, is used to turn off the charging
process when the capacitor is charged to the desired output voltage. The turning on and off of this switch
is controlled by the output of the comparator. One of the inputs to the comparator is tied to a reference
216
Lasers and Optoelectronics

voltage and the other input is applied a fraction of the output voltage through a potential divider
arrangement of R2 and R3. The desired output voltage can be changed by changing either the reference
voltage or the potential divider ratio.
Such a circuit becomes increasingly inefﬁcient due to increased losses in the current-limiting resistor
when the laser is to operate at a higher pulse repetition frequency (PRF). At higher PRF, the charging
current needs to be higher to charge the energy storage capacitor faster due to a relatively smaller inter-
pulse period. One way to overcome this problem is to use inductive current limiting, as shown in Figure
7.12 . Here, the inductive reactance is used to limit the charging current.
The circuit conﬁgurations of Figures 7.11 and 7.12 become ineffective when PRF becomes still higher
and approaches the power line frequency. In this case, few cycles of power line frequency fall within the
charging period; this means that the charging current is in the form of current surges, one current surge
for each half cycle. This renders the charging process erratic and irreproducible due to ﬂuctuations in the
number of current surges appearing in the inter-pulse time period.
A resonant converter overcomes this problem; Figure 7.13 shows the basic circuit. In this case, C1 is
much larger than the energy storage capacitor C2 and acts like a ﬁlter capacitor. The energy storage
capacitor is charged to twice the source voltage in the ﬁrst half cycle of the resonant frequency. Diode D1
prevents any ﬂow of current in the reverse direction when the capacitor is charged to a voltage higher
than the source voltage. The diode also allows the designer to choose the discharge rate of the capacitor
independent of the resonant frequency.
In the case of circuit conﬁgurations discussed in the previous, the AC to DC conversion occurs at
power line frequency which makes them bulkier and inefﬁcient. Modern capacitor-charging power
supplies invariably use switched-mode power supply concepts to derive the beneﬁts inherent to these
supplies. These include relatively much higher conversion efﬁciency and reduced size and weight. In
addition, the source of input power could be either AC in off-line switching supplies or DC depending
upon the intended application. DC as input source of power is particularly attractive for portable and
military laser systems. An overview of different switching supply conﬁgurations along with their

merits/demerits was given in Chapter 6. An externally driven ﬂyback converter best suits the capacitor-
charging power supply requirements as it allows the designer an independent control on the on and off
times of the switching device. This feature is an asset as evident from the following discussion.
Figure 7.14 shows the basic circuit of an externally driven DC/DC converter. In such a case, where a
ﬂyback converter of the type shown in Figure 7.14 is to charge an energy storage capacitor, the design is
not as straightforward as it would be had there been a resistive load. The problem arises for two reasons:
(1) the fundamental fact that the voltage across a capacitor cannot change instantaneously and (2) for a
given energy to be transferred to a capacitor, the quantum by which the capacitor voltage would increase
depends upon the initial voltage across the capacitor just before the energy transfer. It is inversely
proportional to the initial voltage across the capacitor, which implies that the time required to transfer a
given energy to a capacitor would decrease with the build-up of voltage across the capacitor. This
prevents a capacitor-charging unit being designed around the ﬁxed switching frequency.
To create an optimum design, the changing pattern of the voltage quantum needs to be known and a
circuit built that simulates these conditions. This problem is very speciﬁc to laser power supplies and no
available switched-mode power supply (SMPS) controller chip can be used to do the job. It becomes
more severe in the case of portable systems where high conversion efﬁciency is of utmost important.
There are various circuit topologies available for designing a DC/DC converter, such as ﬂyback
converters, forward converters and push-pull converters. However, forward and push-pull converters are
only suitable for loads that are predominantly resistive, such as those encountered in the power supplies
designed for TVs, music systems, personal computers and testing equipment.
These types cannot be used in solid-state laser capacitor-charging power sources where the voltage
across the energy storage capacitor builds up in voltage packets of continuously varying sizes with the
energy transferred in each packet remaining the same. The ﬁrst voltage packet is the largest and the last
packet that takes the capacitor voltage to the desired value the smallest.
Such a load necessitates an independent control on the energy transfer time in accordance with the
pattern of voltage build-up across the capacitor for an optimum power conversion. It is theoretically
feasible to have such a control in a ﬂyback converter where the energy is stored during the on-time of the
switching device and transferred during its off-time.

While in the case of resistive loads it is the voltage regulation that is of prime concern and is achieved
by some form of duty-cycle control, usually pulse width modulation (PWM), in the case of capacitive
loads the energy transfer process is a critical factor. An externally driven ﬂyback converter seems to be
the best bet for this application; however, the entire energy storage and transfer process must be known,
particularly the energy transfer times required in different discrete packets. An appropriate control
circuit that would simulate the desired switching waveform then needs to be designed; what the desired
switching waveform looks like is explained in the following.
In a ﬂyback converter, during the on-time of the switching device (bipolar junction transistor or
MOSFET), the primary winding of the switching transformer stores energy equal to LIP
2/2 where L is the
primary inductance and IP is the peak primary current. This energy is transferred to the energy storage
capacitor to charge it to a certain voltage during the switch-off time of the switching device. In a lossless
and complete transfer of energy, the magnetic energy stored in the primary equals the electrostatic energy
stored in the capacitor. The number of switching cycles required to charge the capacitor to the desired
output voltage VO can be computed from the ratio of energy stored in the capacitor at the ﬁnal voltage
(CVO
2/2) to the energy stored in each switching cycle (LIP
2/2). The size of the voltage packet received by
the capacitor follows a decreasing pattern beginning with the largest in the ﬁrst cycle, as is evident from
the following simple calculations.
The voltage packet received by the capacitor in the ﬁrst cycle when it is fully discharged can be
computed from Equation 7.1:
LI2
P=2 ¼ CV2
1=2
(7.1)
where V1 is the size of the ﬁrst voltage packet. This gives
V1 ¼ IP 
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
L=C
p
(7.2)
This is also the voltage across the energy storage capacitor at the end of the ﬁrst cycle. The voltage
packet received by the capacitor during the second cycle when it is initially charged to voltage V1 is given
by Equation 7.3:
LI2
P=2 ¼ CV2
2=2  CV2
1=2
(7.3)
With the help of simple mathematics, it can be shown that the voltage across the capacitor at the end of
second cycle is given by Equation 7.4:
V2 ¼ V1 

It is evident from the above equations that the voltage packet size reduces in successive cycles with the
build up of voltage across the energy storage capacitor. The time period required to transfer energy in
each cycle depends upon the corresponding voltage packet imparted to the capacitor; a ﬁxed switching
frequency therefore cannot be used. Ideally, the drive waveform must have a variable off-time beginning
with the largest value and then decreasing in a well-deﬁned pattern. It is because of this that the ﬂyback
conﬁguration of Figure 7.14 is not effective. A relatively lower switching frequency to allow complete
energy transfer in the few initial cycles where large off-time is required leads to low conversion
efﬁciency, as in that case the converter is sitting idle for most of the time in the later cycles. The use of a
relatively higher switching frequency with the intention of increasing the conversion efﬁciency leads to
incomplete energy transfer in the initial cycles, which in turn reduces the conversion efﬁciency. In
addition, incomplete energy transfer in a ﬂyback converter could cause damage to the switching device.
Figure 7.15 shows the modiﬁed schematic of a ﬂyback-converter-based capacitor-charging power supply
that takes care of the variable off-time requirement. The circuit operates as described in the following.
The basic difference between the block schematic of Figure 7.15 and the conventional externally
driven ﬂyback converter conﬁguration of Figure 7.14 lies in the mechanism of generating the drive signal
waveform for the switching device. The drive portion of the converter hardware comprises a cascaded
arrangement of a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), a monoshot circuit and a drive circuit. The output
of the VCO feeds the trigger input of the monoshot. The pulse width of the monoshot is chosen to be
equal to the desired on-time of the switching device. The frequency of monoshot output and hence the
off-time of the waveform is governed by the frequency of the VCO output, which in turn depends upon
the voltage applied to its control input. The drive circuit provides the required drive current and/or
voltage depending upon the type of switching device used.
The feedback circuit comprises two independent potential divider arrangements, a subtractor circuit
and a comparator circuit. Potential divider R1–R2 along with the comparator constitutes the voltage sense
loop. The output of the comparator circuit resets the monoshot when the energy storage capacitor has
charged to the desired voltage. Due to this feedback loop, the voltage across the capacitor remains around
the desired value, with the output ripple amplitude depending upon the minimum input differential
required by the comparator to change state at the output and the dividing factor of the potential divider
R1–R2.
As an example, for an output voltage of 1000 V, a dividing factor of 200 may be used to bring it down
to 5 V; an input differential of 5 mV leads to peak-to-peak ripple amplitude of 1 V. Potential divider R3–
R4 along with the subtractor constitutes the energy transfer sense loop. That is, it is instrumental in
generating the desired variable off-time pattern in the drive waveform to ensure complete or almost-
complete energy transfer in different cycles. The subtractor output feeds the control terminal of the VCO.
The voltage present at the output of the subtractor is a function of the output voltage. Output frequency of
VCO depends upon the control voltage. The components of the frequency-determinant network of the
Solid-state Laser Electronics

VCO are chosen such that the energy storage capacitor is fully discharged and the voltage present at the
subtractor output produces VCO output of desired frequency that in turn produces the desired off-time
for the ﬁrst cycle of energy transfer. As the voltage across the capacitor builds up, the output of subtractor
circuit changes in such a manner as to change the drive frequency in the correct direction. That is, the
VCO output frequency reduces in a pattern identical to the pattern of voltage build-up across the
capacitor. In a modiﬁcation of the above design, the comparator, subtractor, VCO and the monoshot can
be replaced by an embedded processor to generate the output waveform to be fed to the drive element.
The above paragraphs are the qualitative description of the concept of having a variable off-time drive
waveform in accordance with the mode of energy transfer in a capacitor-charging power supply
conﬁgured around an externally driven ﬂyback converter. The author has patented this design philosophy
for use with capacitor-charging power supplies for ﬂashlamp-pumped pulsed solid-state lasers. This
design methodology has been used by the author to design a range of high-efﬁciency capacitor-charging
modules with different joules/second delivery ratings for various laser applications. The detailed design
equations are however beyond the scope of this book.
7.4.3
Simmer Power Supply
The purpose of the simmer power supply, as outlined in Section 7.2.1, is to maintain a relatively low-
amplitude keep-alive current through the ﬂashlamp at all times irrespective of whether the lamp is
ﬂashing or not. The simmer power supply maintains a steady-state partial ionization of the ﬂashlamp
during the time the lamp is not ﬂashing. A simmer module must be designed with due consideration to
I–V characteristics of the ﬂashlamp.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Initially, the simmer module generates a high-voltage trigger pulse, typically 10–15 kV, to create pre-
ionization before the simmer power supply can take over and deliver the keep-alive current through the
ﬂashlamp. The simmer power supply is a high-voltage DC power supply producing an output voltage in
the range of 800–1500 V, depending upon the characteristics of the ﬂashlamp and the required magnitude
of simmer current. The output of the simmer power supply is applied to the ﬂashlamp through a series
resistor called ballast resistor. The magnitude of the simmer current therefore depends upon the
difference between the simmer supply output voltage, the voltage across the ﬂashlamp in the simmer
mode (partial ionization state) and the value of the ballast resistance. The value of the ballast resistance
should be slightly higher than the negative impedance offered by the ﬂashlamp in the simmer regime. It
may be mentioned here that the ﬂashlamp offers negative impedance while operating in such a regime.
The voltage v across the lamp in this condition varies as given by Equation 7.13:
v / i0:3
(7.13)
where i is the simmer current.
The above equation indicates the existence of I–V characteristics with negative impedance.
Figure 7.16 shows a simpliﬁed arrangement depicting simmer mode of operation. The power supply
portion can be conﬁgured around a ﬂyback converter topology.
Ideally, the status of the ﬂashlamp should be monitored and the high-voltage trigger-generation part of
the simmer module disabled as soon as the ﬂashlamp starts simmering. Readers may consider delivery of a
single high-voltage (HV) pulse to the ﬂashlamp, assuming that the simmer operation would be established
with the ﬁrst pulse itself, and get rid of the additional circuitry needed to monitor ﬂashlamp status; this is
not advisable, however. The ﬂashlamp may not strike with the ﬁrst pulse and, even if it does so, it can
extinguish during operation. In that case, a fresh HV trigger would be required to restore the simmer mode.
Figure 7.17 shows the block schematic of a simmer module that avoids any eventuality of the lamp
becoming extinguished during operation. The ballast resistance connected from the output of the simmer
supply in series with the lamp is split as two series-connected resistors and a part is used to monitor
current through the ﬂashlamp. The ‘off’ and ‘on’ conditions of the lamp are used to enable or disable an
astable multivibrator whose output, in turn, is used to trigger the SCR-based HV trigger-generating
circuit. The repetition rate of the trigger pulses could be anywhere between 20 and 50 pps.

7.4.4
Pseudo-simmer Mode
For pulse repetition frequencies that are not very high, the simmer mode of operation leads to signiﬁcant
power loss during the long time intervals between the two ﬂashes. This is why the simmer mode of
operation is usually preferred for pulse repetition frequencies in excess of 50 Hz. For relatively lower
PRF, pseudo-simmer mode of operation is employed. It has all the advantages of the simmer mode of
operation with some added circuit complexity. In this, the lamp remains in the non-conducting state for
most of the time between two consecutive ﬂashes and the partial state of ionization (or simmer mode) is
activated about 100–200 ms before every ﬂash trigger pulse. Figure 7.18 shows the typical schematic

arrangement. A simmer initiation trigger pulse activates the partial discharge state. A delayed trigger
pulse ﬁres the SCR, allowing the energy stored in the capacitor to discharge through the lamp producing
a ﬂash.
Example 7.1
Refer to the experimental set-up of Figure 7.19 used to measure the ﬂashlamp impedance in the simmer
mode. Two sets of readings are taken while the ﬂashlamp is simmering.
I. Power supply output voltage ¼ 800 V
Ballast resistance value ¼ 25 kV
Voltage across ﬂashlamp ¼ 300 V.
II. Power supply output voltage ¼ 800 V
Ballast resistance value ¼ 30 kV
Voltage across ﬂashlamp ¼ 350 V
Calculate the ﬂashlamp resistance in the simmer mode.
Solution
1. For the ﬁrst set of readings, simmer current ¼ (800  300)/(25  103) mA ¼ 20 mA
2. For the second set of readings, simmer current ¼ (800  350)/(30  103) mA ¼ 15 mA
3. Magnitude of the change in the simmer current is therefore ¼ 5 mA
4. Corresponding change in magnitude of ﬂashlamp voltage ¼ 50 V
5. Magnitude of ﬂashlamp impedance ¼ 50/(5  103) ¼ 10 kV
6. This resistance is negative as a decrease in simmer current has resulted in an increase in ﬂashlamp
voltage.
7.4.5
Pulse-forming Network
The pulse-forming network (PFN) shapes the ﬂashlamp current pulse and is designed to produce a
critically damped current pulse. A single-section PFN can be used as shown in Figure 7.20 a or a
multiple-mesh PFN as shown in Figure 7.20b. The PFN functions as follows.
As is evident from the single-section PFN, which is also the most commonly used PFN conﬁguration,
it is basically a series R–L–C network with the capacitor charged to a certain DC voltage, where R
represents the resistance offered by the ﬂashlamp. When the capacitor is made to discharge through the

ﬂashlamp, the shape of the current pulse through the ﬂashlamp is governed by one of the following three

2. R > 2

3. R ¼ 2

In the case of the ﬁrst condition, the current pulse is said to be under-damped and the value of the
damping factor a is between 0.2 and 0.8. The current pulse waveform is oscillatory with cyclic negative
values of current. Current reversals lead to highly inefﬁcient pumping. In addition, ﬂashlamps are also
prone to damage due to repetitive current reversals as they are designed for current ﬂow in one direction
only.
In the case of the second condition, the current pulse is said to be over-damped with value of damping
factor a > 0.8 (typically 0.8 < a < 3). Although there are no current reversals in this case, the current
pulse is characterized by a reasonably fast rise but a very slow decrease with time up to the ﬂash
extinction. Also, the peak value of the current is never reached. This is an inefﬁcient method of pumping
the ﬂashlamp.
In the case of the third condition, the current pulse is said to be critically damped which corresponds to
damping factor a ¼ 0.8. There are no current reversals and the rise time is faster (slower) than in the case
of the over- (under-) damped condition. Current pulse rise time is more or less equal to the current decay
time, which results in better efﬁciency and optimal peak intensities. A slightly under-damped current
pulse may be used to achieve shorter rise time and consequent higher value of peak current, providing
care is taken to keep current reversal well within the prescribed limits of the ﬂashlamp and energy storage
capacitor. Figure 7.21 shows a comparison of current pulse shape in the three cases discussed above.
The above analysis however assumes that the ﬂashlamp resistance is constant during the entire
duration of the current pulse. In practice, the ﬂashlamp resistance exhibits a time-varying behaviour.

The design guidelines listed below should be followed to ensure a critically damped current pulse.
These guidelines have been derived from extensive study of the behaviour of pulse-forming networks
containing a ﬂashlamp and their associated time-varying impedance.
1. The ﬁrst step is to calculate the value of energy storage capacitor from the known values of pulse
width tp, energy to be discharged through the ﬂashlamp EO and the ﬂashlamp impedance parameter
K0. For critically damped current pulse, the value of energy storage capacitor in farads (C) is
computed from: Equation 7.17:
C ¼ 2EOa4T2K4

(7.18)
where T ¼ p(LC).
2. Having computed the value of C, the next step is to calculate the value of PFN inductance L to
determine the desired pulse width. L is computed from Equation 7.19:
L ¼
t2
p
9C
(7.19)
where tp is the pulse width measured at one-third of the peak value of current pulse.

As is evident from the above equations, rise and fall times in the case of multiple-mesh PFN are
relatively much shorter than their single-mesh counterparts. The current pulse also has a relatively ﬂatter
top, but with a reduced value of current peak as shown in Figure 7.22. The advantage of such a current
pulse shape is that it provides more constant pumping of the laser medium throughout the duration of the
pulse.
Designing a multiple-mesh PFN is an iterative process. The ﬁrst step is to estimate the ﬂashlamp
resistance from an assumed value of peak current. The characteristic impedance Z of the PFN is set equal
to the ﬂashlamp resistance and the values of CT and LT are computed from Equations 7.26 and 7.27,
respectively:
CT ¼ tp
2ZO
(7.26)
LT ¼ tpZO

(7.27)
where tp in this case is taken to be the pulse width measured at 70% of the peak value.

The new value of peak current is now calculated and compared with the assumed value on the basis of
which CT, LT and V have been computed. If they do not match, a new value of peak current is assumed
and the PFN components re-determined. The process continues until convergence takes place.
Example 7.2
It is desired to discharge energy of 10 J through a ﬂashlamp in a critically damped pulse of 100 ms
duration. If the ﬂashlamp impedance parameter K0 is 15 V A1/2, determine the values of L and C of
the pulse-forming network that would achieve the objective. Also determine the DC voltage which
the capacitor should be charged to for the desired quantum of pulse energy and the resulting peak
current.

across the lamp and the instantaneous current through it at a certain time were observed to be 400 Vand

instantaneous current was observed to be 324 A. Determine the voltage across the lamp at that instant of
time. Also determine lamp resistance in the two conditions.

Flashlamp Trigger Circuit
Simmer and non-simmer modes of operation were discussed earlier in Section 7.4.1. In the case of non-
simmer mode operation, the energy storage capacitor is connected across the lamp and there is no
isolation between the capacitor and the ﬂashlamp (Figure 7.10). The capacitor is made to discharge
through the ﬂashlamp by application of a high-voltage pulse of the order of 10–20 kV. In the case of
simmer mode operation, the energy storage capacitor is kept isolated from the lamp by a series-
connected high-voltage switch such as an SCR or a triggered spark gap (Figure 7.9). In this case, the
trigger pulse is applied to this switch to turn it on, thus allowing the energy storage capacitor to discharge
through the ﬂashlamp. The trigger pulse is a low-voltage pulse in the case of an SCR and a high-voltage
pulse in the case of triggered spark gap. In the case of simmer mode operation, a high-voltage trigger
circuit is also needed for initiating a state of partial ionization for the simmer supply to take over.
Different high-voltage trigger circuits used for ﬂashlamp triggering are discussed in the following.
There are four types of high-voltage trigger circuits that can possibly be used for the purpose, each
having its own merits and demerits.
1. over-voltage triggering
2. external triggering
3. series triggering
4. parallel triggering.
In the case of an over-voltage trigger circuit (Figure 7.23), the DC voltage across the energy storage
capacitor is sufﬁcient to break down the gas inside the ﬂashlamp and initiate the main discharge. The DC
voltage appears across the ﬂashlamp once the series-connected high-voltage switch is turned on. The
switch may be an SCR, a MOSFET or a triggered spark gap. Although the trigger circuit is simple, it is
not common with solid-state lasers.
In the case of an external-trigger circuit (Figure 7.24), the high-voltage trigger pulse is applied to a
trigger wire wrapped around the outside envelope of the ﬂashlamp. In the case of liquid-cooled
applications, the trigger pulse may be applied to the metal laser cavity. However, caution should be
exercised in this case because of the high voltages involved. The main advantage of the external trigger is
that it does not interfere with the main energy discharge circuit. The disadvantage is that the high-voltage
trigger point is exposed and therefore needs to be properly isolated from the environment to avoid

problems in conditions of high altitude or humidity. External triggering is recommended for low
repetition rate low-energy systems where the ﬂashlamp is air cooled.
In the case of a series-trigger circuit (Figure 7.25), the secondary winding of the trigger transformer is
in series with the energy storage capacitor. The secondary winding carries the ﬂashlamp discharge
current. The series trigger transformer is designed such that the transformer core saturates and the
saturated secondary winding inductance also performs the function of the PFN inductor. Series
triggering offers the advantages of reliable and reproducible triggering. Triggering is reliable even
for low-energy storage capacitor voltages. The reliability of the triggering is enhanced by using a ground
plane near the lamp. In the case of air-cooled lamps, this may be done by wrapping a wire around the
lamp and connecting one of the ends to the ground terminal. In the case of liquid-cooled lamps, a metal
laser cavity may be used as the ground plane. Disadvantages include the large trigger transformer

required to obtain the desired saturated secondary inductance. The secondary winding also uses a thicker
wire in order to be able to carry a high value of discharge current.
In the case of a parallel-trigger circuit (Figure 7.26), the secondary of the trigger transformer is
connected in parallel. The circuit has all the advantages of series triggering and also uses a small trigger
transformer. In this case, however, the secondary of the transformer needs to be isolated from the energy
storage capacitor by using a capacitor or a diode not shown in Figure 7.26. This method is rarely used due
to the prohibitively high cost of protection components.
In the different triggering circuits discussed above, with the exception of over-voltage triggering, the
trigger pulse is generated by discharging a capacitor into the primary winding of a trigger transformer
using an SCR as a switch. The trigger voltage amplitude appearing across the secondary of the trigger
transformer is in the range of 10–20 kV. Trigger pulse energy of the order of 100 mJ and trigger capacitor
in the range of 0.1–1.0 mF charged to a voltage in the range of 300–800 V serves the purpose. The trigger
pulse duration is typically a few microseconds. A trigger pulse duration of a minimum of 60 ns/cm of arc
length of ﬂashlamp is recommended.
7.5
Electronics for CW Solid-state Lasers
Continuous wave (CW) solid-state lasers are pumped by arc lamps. Arc lamps are also used to pump
solid-state lasers operating at very high repetition rates of the order of tens of kilohertz. In that case, the
pumping is continuous and the pulsed operation of the laser is accomplished by using an optical switch in
the laser cavity. Before discussing the power supplies for operating arc lamps, a brief description of the
types and characteristic parameters of arc lamps is presented in the following sections.
7.5.1
Arc Lamps
Like ﬂashlamps, arc lamps are also gas-discharge tubes of a similar design with the difference that they
are designed to operate in CW mode. There are two types of arc lamps: linear arc lamps and short arc
lamps. It is the linear arc lamp that is well suited to act as the pump source for solid-state lasers.
Structurally, linear arc lamps are similar to linear ﬂashlamps except for the electrode design. Arc lamps
use pointed cathodes while ﬂashlamps use rounded cathodes.
Although arc lamps may be ﬁlled with different gases, including krypton, xenon, mercury and
mercury-xenon, it is the krypton-ﬁlled linear arc lamp that suits solid-state lasers (Nd:YAG lasers in
particular) the best. Xenon arc lamps have a relatively broad emission spectrum and are not well matched
to the absorption bands of Nd:YAG. Mercury arc lamps have strong emission in ultraviolet. Mercury-
xenon arc lamps are characterized by an emission spectrum that is a combination of mercury lines in
ultraviolet and xenon lines in infrared. The emission spectrum of a krypton arc lamp is in the wavelength

Solid-state Laser Electronics
233

band of 750–900 nm (Figure 7.27), which matches the peak absorption of Nd:YAG in 800 nm region. In
fact, under favourable conditions as much as 40% of the light output from the krypton arc lamp can be
used for excitation of Nd:YAG. The gas is ﬁlled at a pressure in the range 1–3 atmospheres. The useful
output power of krypton arc lamps used for pumping Nd:YAG lasers increases rapidly with input power,
gas-ﬁll pressure and bore diameter.
7.5.2
Electrical Characteristics
Figure 7.28 shows typical I–V characteristics of an arc lamp. The characteristic curve exhibits a negative
resistance region characterized by a steep fall in voltage with a corresponding small increase in current.
This is followed by a positive resistance region with a relatively much lower slope. The operation of an
arc lamp can be divided into three regimes: initial arc formation, unconﬁned discharge regime and
conﬁned and wall-stabilized discharge regime.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

The triggering process initiates the electrical discharge in the gas forming a thin stream of spark in the
gap between the electrodes, thus creating a conductive path between them. Triggering is initiated with
the application of a high-voltage trigger pulse in the range of 20–30 kV. If the power supply output
voltage is greater than the voltage drop across the conducting path, current begins to ﬂow through the
lamp. The discharge region is initially very thin and said to be unconﬁned. The discharge region begins to
expand with a resultant rapid fall in voltage. When the discharge expands to ﬁll the tube, it is stabilized by
the presence of envelope of the lamp. While the arc lamp exhibits negative resistance in the unconﬁned
discharge region, it is positive in the wall-stabilized regime. In the positive resistance region of I–V
characteristics, a large increase in lamp current produces a relatively much smaller increase in lamp
voltage, indicating a low value of positive impedance. This is in contrast to the unconﬁned discharge
regime where a rapid fall in voltage is associated with a small increase in current, indicating a large
negative resistance.
7.5.3
Arc Lamp Power Supply
The power supply for an arc lamp has three components:
1. trigger circuit to initiate discharge
2. starting circuit, also called boost power supply, for driving the lamp during arc expansion
3. power supply for supplying current during wall-stabilized region.
Figure 7.29 shows a typical power supply arrangement for driving an arc lamp. The trigger circuit
generates a high-voltage trigger pulse to initiate the discharge. Usually the energy in the trigger pulse is
not sufﬁcient to take the discharge current and lamp voltage to a point on the I–V characteristics where
the load line of the main power supply intersects it in the negative resistance region.
Figure 7.30 shows the I–V characteristics along with the load line (marked load line I) of a typical main
power supply. This load line intersects the I–V characteristics at points A and B. If the trigger pulse fails
to take the discharge state to point A, the main power supply will not be able to drive it to point B in the
stabilized regime. Any attempt to design the main power supply to be able to do the job is not practical as
it would require a much higher output voltage than is actually required for running the arc lamp. It is
because of this reason that we need another power supply, with relatively higher output voltage, capable
of supplying the desired current for a short time during the discharge expansion regime. It may be
Figure 7.29

Solid-state Laser Electronics

mentioned here that this power supply has a relatively low output current delivery capability of the order
of a few tens of milliamperes at an output voltage of the order of 1.5–2 kV. The output of the power
supply is used to charge a capacitor that can supply the required current for a short time. This power
supply is characterized by a load line (marked load line II in Figure 7.30. This power supply, referred to
as boost power supply, begins to pass current and drive the lamp through the discharge expansion regime.
When the voltage across the lamp falls below the output voltage of the main power supply, the main
power supply takes over and starts operating the lamp in the stabilized regime.
Referring to the circuit schematic of Figure 7.29, the boost power supply output charges capacitor C1
through resistors R1 and R2 when the power supply is switched on. Diode D1 isolates the boost power
supply output from the relatively much lower output voltage of main power supply. Capacitor C1 and R2–
C1 time constant are selected in order to provide the desired current for the desired time period during
discharge expansion. R1 limits the current that can be drawn from the boost power supply output. With a
much lower resistance value, R2 provides the desired current for a short time period. Ballast resistor R3 is
used in series with the output of the main power supply to achieve the desired value of the lamp current in
the stabilized regime.
7.5.4
Modulated CW and Quasi-CW Operation of Arc Lamp
In the case of quasi-CW operation, the arc lamp is driven by a current that has a sinusoidal wave shape
with a DC value as shown in Figure 7.31. The difference between the peak value of the drive current and
the DC value, called depth of modulation, is usually not allowed to exceed 50% of the DC value. While
using this mode of operation, the maximum power rating of the arc lamp must not be exceeded. The
frequency of modulation is chosen to be either 50 Hz or 100 Hz, simplifying the power supply design.
Figure 7.31
Quasi-CW operation of arc lamp.
Figure 7.30
I–V characteristics with load line.
236
Lasers and Optoelectronics

In the case of modulated CW operation, the arc lamp current and consequently its light output is
switched between two values with upper- and lower-level time periods being in the range of a few
seconds. The upper-level current is kept equal to the nominal current and the lower-level current
is chosen in order to be above the minimum recommended current level. The waveform is shown in
Figure 7.32. While using this mode of operation, it must be ensured that the average power rating of the
arc lamp is not exceeded.
7.6
Solid-state Laser Designators and Rangeﬁnders
Laser rangeﬁnders are used by the armed forces to measure ranges of potential targets. These are used
on ground as well as on airborne platforms to range both ground and airborne targets. In the modern
battleﬁeld scenario, a rangeﬁnder is hooked directly onto the gunnery computer in what is known as
the integrated ﬁre control system. Rangeﬁnders are also used by astronomers (for measuring the
distances to planets) and by surveyors. The application-related aspects of laser rangeﬁnders are
described in Chapter 14.
A laser target designator on the other hand is used to mark or identify a target to smart ammunition
(bomb, projectile, missile, etc.) by sending a series of coded laser pulses at a high repetition rate
(typically 10–20 pps). The bomb or missile that has the corresponding decoder can then home in on the
target.
The basic building blocks of electronics of a laser rangeﬁnder or a designator are similar to those used
in the case of a typical Q-switched solid-state laser source, except that the circuit that generates the
ﬂashlamp ﬁring commands has an encoder. They invariably have a receiving channel that is used to
determine the range of the designated target; both laser rangeﬁnders and target designators therefore
have additional building blocks used in the receiving channel. The capacitor-charging power supply in
the case of a laser designator is rated for relatively much higher joules/second output delivery capability
due to both the higher pulse energy (100–150 mJ) and the pulse repetition frequency (10–20 pps). On the
other hand, laser rangeﬁnders with relatively much lower pulse energy (5–10 mJ) and pulse repetition
frequency (10–20 pulses per minute) need a capacitor-charging power supply with much lower
joules/second rating.
Figure 7.33 shows the building blocks of the receiving channel of the laser rangeﬁnder. To avoid
repetition, the laser source electronics is omitted here. One of the most critical building blocks of the
receiver section is the optoelectronic front-end. The function of the front-end circuit is to transform the
received laser pulse, which could be anywhere in the range of 5–50 ns, to an equivalent electrical signal.
The peak power of the received laser pulse could be as low as a few tens of nanowatts when ranging a far-
off target and as high as a few tens of milliwatts when the target is close by. This implies that the ampliﬁer

Solid-state Laser Electronics
237

portion of the front-end needs to have a dynamic range as high as 100–110 dB. This is usually achieved
partly in the avalanche photodiode (APD) by controlling the responsivity of the device through its
reverse-bias variation and partly in the gain-controlled ampliﬁer stage. Laser pulse width determines the
bandwidth that the front-end optoelectronic conversion and the programmable ampliﬁer circuits that
follow it must have. The required bandwidth is inversely proportional to the rise time of the received laser
pulses and can be computed from Equation 7.29:
BW ¼ 350
tr
(7.29)
where BW is the bandwidth in MHz and tr is the rise time in ns.
The design of range counter determines range resolution and accuracy. The conventional method of
counting a ﬁxed clock frequency between the start and stop laser pulses has its accuracy limited by the
clock frequency. Range measurement accuracy equals  c= 2  f clock
ð
Þ
½
. This technique can be
conveniently used up to a range accuracy of 5 m. A clock frequency of 150 MHz is needed to achieve
an accuracy of 1 m. For higher accuracy and resolution, other counting techniques must be used.
Advances in technology have made sub-metre accuracy rangeﬁnders built around solid-state lasers
possible.
7.7
Summary
 Only 30% of the electronics packages of contemporary lasers and laser-based systems are concerned
with required power supplies.
 In the case of ﬂashlamp-pumped pulsed solid-state lasers, in addition to the capacitor-charging module
used to pump the ﬂashlamp, important circuit modules include the simmer module, the pulse-forming
network, the ﬂashlamp trigger and the Q-switch driver modules.
 The simmer module is used to maintain a low current discharge through the lamp when the lamp is not
ﬂashing. Simmer mode of operation has advantages of better pulse-to-pulse reproducibility, absence of
requirement of high-voltage trigger pulse every time the energy stored in the capacitor is to be
discharged through the lamp, enhanced ﬂashlamp life and reduced electromagnetic interference. In the
case of pseudo-simmer mode of operation, the low-current simmer discharge state is not maintained
throughout the inter-pulse period. Instead, it is initiated about 100–200 ms before every ﬂashlamp

ﬁring pulse. This method of operation leads to reduced power loss due to simmer current while
retaining all the advantages of simmer mode operation.
 Different methods of ﬂashlamp triggering include over-voltage triggering, external triggering, series
triggering and parallel triggering. Series and external triggering schemes are the most commonly used.
 The PFN is used to obtain the desired ﬂashlamp discharge current pulse shape. It is designed to ensure
a critically damped current pulse, which leads to most optimum conversion efﬁciency.
 CW solid-state lasers are pumped by arc lamps. The power supply for an arc-lamp-pumped solid-state
laser includes a trigger module for initiating the arc discharge, a boost power supply to drive the lamp
through the discharge expansion regime and the main power supply that operates the lamp in the
stabilized regime.
 In addition to the CW mode of operation of arc lamps, other operational modes include the
modulated CW and quasi-CW modes. In the case of quasi-CW operation, the arc lamp is driven
by a current that has a sinusoidal wave shape with a DC value. The depth of modulation in this
case is not allowed to exceed 50% of the DC value. In the case of modulated CW operation, the
lamp current and consequently its light output is switched between two values with upper- and
lower-level time periods being in the range of few seconds. The upper-level current is kept
equal at the nominal value and the lower-level current is kept above the minimum recommended
current value.
 If a solid-state laser is to function as a rangeﬁnder, building blocks such as high-speed optoelectronic
conversion, high bandwidth ampliﬁer with controllable gain, high-speed digital counting circuit and
an appropriate interface/display console are involved.

Gas Laser Electronics
8.1
Introduction
Gas laser electronics primarily comprises the power supply used to initiate and subsequently sustain
electrical discharge through the gas mixture contained in a sealed envelope. The active medium is
usually excited either by passing an electric discharge current along the length of the tube, known as
longitudinal excitation, or perpendicular to the length of the laser tube, known as transverse excitation.
Frequency stabilization electronics used in the case of actively stabilized Doppler-broadened gas lasers
such as helium-neon and carbon dioxide lasers is another area that relates to gas laser electronics. This
chapter describes the fundamentals of gas laser power supplies in terms of requirement speciﬁcations,
circuit conﬁgurations and design guidelines, with particular reference to the two most commonly used
gas lasers: helium-neon and carbon dioxide lasers. Power supply conﬁgurations for metal vapour lasers
and excimer lasers and, to a large extent, noble gas ion lasers are similar to those used for helium-neon
and carbon dioxide lasers except for minor deviations, which are also discussed in this chapter.
Frequency stabilization techniques used in the case of helium-neon and carbon dioxide lasers are
also examined with the help of schematic diagrams to illustrate design issues, merits and demerits of
each of the conﬁgurations.
8.2
Gas Discharge Characteristics
As outlined earlier in Chapter 4, most gas lasers are driven by electrical discharge through the laser gas
mixture. The discharge is struck either longitudinally, by passing electrical current along the length of the
discharge tube (longitudinal excitation), or perpendicular to the length of the tube, by passing electric
current transverse to the length of the tube (transverse excitation). The two modes are reproduced
schematically in Figure 8.1a and b for longitudinal excitation and transverse excitation, respectively.
While the former is used in the case of low-power CW lasers, the latter is used in high-power CW or
pulsed lasers.
The electrical discharge is initiated and subsequently sustained with the help of a suitably designed
power supply. The electrons in the electrical discharge transfer their energy to the molecules that
constitute the active species either directly (e.g. carbon dioxide lasers) or indirectly (e.g. helium-neon
lasers), producing population inversion essential for laser action.
8.3
Gas Laser Power Supplies
The design of a power supply needed to initiate and sustain electrical discharge through the gas mixture
is governed by the current–voltage characteristics of the electrical discharge. Although the nature of the
current–voltage characteristics of electrical discharge is the same for different gas mixtures, the
Lasers and Optoelectronics: Fundamentals, Devices and Applications, First Edition. Anil K. Maini.
 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published 2013 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

magnitudes of discharge current and corresponding voltage may be different. Consequently, the power
supply topologies used for various gas lasers are similar but the design parameters vary. For example, the
breakdown voltage of the gas ﬁll depends not only on the nature of the gas but also on the gas pressure,
size and shape of electrodes and also the inter-electrode spacing. Breakdown voltage is about 1.3 kV/cm
of discharge length for neon at 1 atm and 3.4 kV/cm of discharge length for argon at 1 atm.
Figure 8.2 shows the generalized form of the current–voltage characteristics of the gas discharge. At
low values of the applied voltage, the discharge current is zero and remains essentially zero until a certain
minimum threshold voltage is reached. As this threshold voltage is exceeded, a small amount of current

Gas-discharge current-voltage characteristics.
Gas Laser Electronics

of the order of a few nanoamps begins to ﬂow through the discharge due to the existence of some
ionization. This is known as the pre-breakdown current.
The pre-breakdown current increases slowly with an increase in applied voltage until the breakdown
point is reached (Point A). At the breakdown voltage, a large number of molecules in the gas mixture
become ionized and conductivity of the gas mixture increases. Electrons are accelerated to velocities
where they transfer energy to more molecules through collisions. An increase in discharge current causes
further reduction in discharge resistance with the result that the voltage required to sustain the discharge
actually decreases with increase in current. This gives rise to what is called negative resistance region in
the gas-discharge current–voltage characteristics, as indicated by region B–C–D in Figure 8.2.
If the discharge current was allowed to increase without limit, catastrophe may occur at some value of
discharge current. The discharge current therefore needs to be limited by connecting a positive resistance
in series with the load. The series resistance used to limit the current to an acceptable value is known as
the ballast resistance. In the gas discharge curve of Figure 8.2, current is shown to vary from nanoamps to
kiloamps. This is intended to cover the whole range of gas discharge devices used for laser applications.
The discharge current in the case of helium-neon lasers is of the order of a few milliamps. The discharge
current would be of the order several amps in CW arc lamps and several kiloamps in the case of pulsed
ﬂash lamps.
The power supply essentially comprises a starter circuit and a power supply with current limiting
feature. The starter circuit provides the high-voltage pulse to initiate the discharge. The peak amplitude
of this high-voltage trigger pulse should necessarily be greater than the breakdown voltage of the gas
mixture in question. The power supply delivers the steady-state current to maintain the discharge at the
desired values of current and voltage. The current-limiting resistance or ballast resistance disallows
unbounded increase in discharge current. Figure 8.3 depicts the generalized block schematic arrange-
ment of a power supply for a DC-excited gas-discharge laser.
8.4
Helium-Neon Laser Power Supply
The task of designing a power supply for a helium-neon (He-Ne) laser could range from a routine
exercise of designing a high-voltage low-current power supply with a moderate current regulation
requirement to a highly complex task involving current stabilization of a very high order. At the lower
end of the complexity scale, the designer would attempt to achieve the twin objectives of plasma
excitation and sustenance in laboratory-use lasers; at the other end, design of a He-Ne-based system such
as a ring laser gyroscope is a highly complex task.
The He-Ne laser uses a low-pressure helium-neon mixture (predominantly helium with about 10%
neon) contained in a narrow bore glass tube. A mirror of almost 100% reﬂectance forms one end of the
resonator and another mirror with about 1% transmission forms the other end. With an appropriate
choice of gas mixture, processing technique and resonator optics, this laser can be made to emit at any of

the four wavelengths: 0.6328 mm (red); 0.5435 mm (green); 1.523 mm (infrared); and 3.391 mm
(infrared).
An He-Ne laser is pumped by an electric discharge through the gas mixture, thus creating He-Ne
plasma. Commercial He-Ne lasers are almost invariably DC excited, although excitation by RF means,
which is more popular in the case of CO2 lasers, is also possible. The process of excitation in the case of a
He-Ne laser involves application of a high voltage of the order of 10 kV initially across the electrodes of
the plasma tube to initiate the plasma. Once the plasma is initiated, the voltage required to sustain the
excitation is usually of the order 2500 V or so.
Both the excitation voltage as well as the sustaining voltage is dependent upon the intended
laser power output of the tube, which in turn depends upon several He-Ne plasma tube parameters.
Plasma current that needs to be supplied at the plasma tube sustaining voltage is in the range of 5–10 mA.
Table 8.1 lists the major power supply performance features of different types of He-Ne lasers from
Melles-Griot, a leading manufacturer of He-Ne lasers and He-Ne laser plasma tubes. These features are
also broadly found in the power supplies of other leading He-Ne laser manufactures.
Another important requirement is that of providing an appropriate ballast resistance to be connected in
series with the plasma discharge impedance, wired as close to the electrode as possible as shown
in Figure 8.4. Figure 8.5 shows the current–voltage (I–V) characteristics of the He-Ne discharge.
The plasma I–V characteristics exhibit a negative resistance as shown in the I–V curve of Figure 8.5. The
ballast resistance ensures that the power supply encounters a positive resistance while delivering current
to the plasma discharge. This is a necessary condition to initiate stable plasma discharge. The negative
resistance offered by the plasma is given by the reciprocal of the slope of the tangent drawn at the
operating point in the curve of Figure 8.6.
Example 8.1
In a certain He-Ne laser plasma tube, an operating current of 5 mA causes a voltage of 1250 Vacross the
tube. A 1 mA change in plasma discharge current causes a 100 V change in voltage across the tube.
Determine the minimum value of the required ballast resistance for stable discharge. Also determine the
minimum value of the DC voltage at the output of power supply to sustain stable discharge.
Solution
1. Negative impedance offered by the laser plasma at the operating current¼ 100/(1 103) V ¼ 100kV
2. Therefore, for stable operation, minimum value of ballast resistance RB ¼ 100 kV

In the case of the He-Ne laser plasma tube of Example 8.1, if the DC power supply output voltage is
2500 V what would be the value of the ballast resistance needed to operate the plasma tube at the same
operating current?
Solution
1. At the operating current of 5 mA, voltage across the tube ¼ 1250 V
2. Required voltage drop across the ballast resistance ¼ (2500  1250) ¼ 1250 V
3. Therefore, value of ballast resistance ¼ 1250/(5  103) V ¼ 250 kV.

Power Supply Design
One design approach, which is also the most commonly used approach in the case of commercial He-Ne
laser power supplies, is to use a voltage multiplier chain to generate the required high voltage for plasma
excitation from a relatively much lower input voltage. The power supply in this case is usually designed
for a power output capability equal to the product of the voltage (plasma tube voltage at the operating
current plus the expected drop across the ballast resistance) and the plasma current. In a supply like this,
the multiplier chain raises the output voltage to a magnitude needed for initiating the discharge. The
moment plasma is struck and the current is drawn from the power supply, the output voltage falls to a
lower value required to sustain the plasma.
One possible circuit conﬁguration using a step-up power transformer followed by a cascade-type
voltage multiplier chain is shown in Figure 8.6. The step-up ratio and the multiplying factor are
chosen in order to produce an output DC voltage of about 10 kV required for initiating the plasma. A
step-up transformer that produces an output voltage of 1000 V RMS followed by a cascade-type
voltage multiplier chain with a multiplication factor of 8 could possibly be used for the circuit of
Figure 8.6. Such a circuit would produce at its output a DC voltage equal to 8Vm, where Vm is the peak
AC voltage across the secondary of the transformer. For a 1000 V RMS across the transformer
secondary, the no-load output voltage would be about 11 kV, which is just the right voltage for
exciting the He-Ne plasma.
In the circuit of Figure 8.6, the multiplication factor of the cascade multiplier chain needs to be an even
number. A similar circuit conﬁguration with an odd multiplication factor is shown in Figure 8.7. The
designer is free to exercise this ﬂexibility in choosing the transformer step-up ratio and the multiplier’s
multiplication factor, depending upon what is optimum in a given situation. In the circuit conﬁguration of
Figure 8.7, the multiplication factor is 7.
Once the plasma is struck and current is drawn from the power supply, the output voltage falls due to
voltage drops in the transformer windings and diodes in the multiplier chain. Ideally, this voltage should
drop to a value equal to the required power supply voltage for plasma sustenance, which is the sum of the
plasma tube voltage at the desired plasma current plus the voltage drop across the ballast resistance. If the
voltage does not fall to the required value and is instead higher than that, then the excess voltage would
have to be dropped across an additional resistance in series with the ballast resistance in order to obtain
the desired plasma current. Otherwise, the plasma current would be greater than the desired operating
value of the ballast resistor.
It may be mentioned here that most of the voltage drop occurs across the multiplier chain.
The components of the chain are chosen in order to drop the required voltage across it. For a
Figure 8.6

multiplier chain with an even multiplication factor, the output voltage VO can be expressed by
Equation 8.1:
VO ¼
nVp
1 þ n n2=2 þ 1
ð


(8.1)
where n is the multiplication factor; Vp is the peak value of the voltage at the input to the multiplier
chain; f is the frequency of the AC input; C is the capacitance of each capacitor in the chain; and RL
is the load resistance.
In the case where the multiplication factor is odd, the output voltage VO can be expressed by
Equation 8.2:
VO ¼
nVp
1 þ n n2  1
ð
Þ=12fCRL
½

(8.2)
In both cases, as is clear from the above equations, the output voltage is n times the input voltage to the
multiplier chain only when the factor within the brackets in the denominator is zero. For this to happen,
the denominator of the bracketed term needs to be much greater than the numerator. For the given values
of frequency and load resistance, this can be achieved by using large-value capacitors.
As the desired multiplication factor increases, it can be seen that the capacitance value becomes
prohibitively large even for moderate values of load current. That is why the multiplier chain of this
type is inherently poorly regulated. This can be used to advantage in the case of a He-Ne laser power
supply design, however. For instance, for the given values of load resistance (which is determined by
the required power supply output voltage for plasma sustenance and the plasma current) and the
frequency of the input to the chain (50 Hz in the case of a chain operating from the AC mains), the
value of C can be chosen in order to obtain an output voltage that equals the required output voltage
for plasma sustenance.
For a multiplication factor of 8 and frequency equal to 50 Hz, the value of capacitance would be about
0.04 mF if the laser power supply output had to produce an output voltage of 2000 V for a plasma current
of 5 mA, assuming that the input AC signal to the multiplier chain input is 1000 V RMS or about 1400 V
peak. For the circuit of Figure 8.6, if the capacitance value is 0.04 mF the output voltage would
automatically fall from an initial no-load value of about 11 kV to about 2000 V when a plasma current of
5 mA is drawn from it.
Figure 8.7
He-Ne power supply with a cascade multiplier chain having an odd multiplication factor.
248
Lasers and Optoelectronics

The multiplier chain as a whole offers a series resistance which drops a voltage across it when current
is drawn from it. The multiplier chain may be represented by an equivalent circuit of the type shown in
Figure 8.8. This equivalent series source resistance increases (to a very good approximation) with the
cube of the multiplication factor. This implies that if the multiplication factor is doubled, then for a given
operating frequency the capacitance will have to be increased by a factor of 8 if the multiplier circuit was
to maintain the same output voltage on load.
Another multiplier circuit conﬁguration that offers superior performance in terms of efﬁciency is
shown in Figure 8.9. The conﬁguration shown here is that of a multiplier with an even multiplication
factor. The circuit works at an efﬁciency that is better than that of the circuit using equal value
capacitances. The circuits shown in Figures 8.6–8.9 are half-wave circuits. A full-wave voltage
multiplier that gives a far better ripple performance is depicted in Figure 8.10. The circuit shown is
a quadrupler.
Example 8.3
A certain He-Ne laser power supply is designed using a cascade voltage multiplier chain of the type
shown in Figure 8.6 and a multiplication factor of 8. If the peak value of the 50 Hz waveform at the input
of the multiplier chain is 1500 V, determine the minimum capacitance value of the capacitors used in the
multiplier chain to produce the desired value of 1000 Vacross the plasma tube at an operating current of
4 mA. Assume the value of ballast resistance to be 100 kV.

8.4.2
Switched-mode Power Supply Conﬁgurations
The concept of using a multiplier chain fed at the input by an AC signal can be implemented far more
effectively and efﬁciently by using a switched-mode power supply to drive the voltage multiplier chain.
The most obvious SMPS conﬁguration for such an application is the push-pull circuit as it generates a
square-wave AC signal across the secondary of the switching transformer. Both self-oscillating as well as
externally driven conﬁgurations can be used; the latter conﬁguration has better control over various
performance parameters.
Avariety of switched-mode IC controllers are available that are suitable for driving the two transistors
(bipolar junction transistor or BJT; metal-oxide semiconductor ﬁeld-effect transistor or MOSFET) of the
push-pull conﬁguration; ICs LM/SG3524, TL494, TL594 and TL497 are a few examples. The peak
value of the square-wave output across the transformer secondary equals the input DC voltage applied to
the centre tap of the transformer primary, multiplied by the step-up ratio of the transformer. Again, the
converter could operate off-line where a bridge circuit transforms the AC mains input into a proportional
DC, which in turn feeds the centre tap of the push-pull transformer primary.
In the case where the converter is off-line, there is no isolation transformer for the mains. In such a case
the feedback loop must have isolation so that the DC output is cut off from the AC line. This is usually
accomplished by using an opto-isolator.
The other option is to operate the converter from a relatively lower DC voltage of, say, 24 V DC, which
could be generated from a step-down transformer, rectiﬁer and ﬁlter combination. The transformer here
Figure 8.10
Full-wave voltage multiplier.
250
Lasers and Optoelectronics

provides isolation, which eliminates the need to use additional isolation on the output side. It may be
mentioned that a typical He-Ne power supply needs to deliver about 10 W of power. The use of step-
down transformer, rectiﬁer and ﬁlter does not really add signiﬁcantly to the size, while it allows the
designer to use much lower-voltage switching devices.
The switched-mode version has all the advantages associated with switched-mode power supplies
such as higher efﬁciency and small size. To use a push-pull converter with a voltage multiplier chain for
designing a He-Ne power supply, the required capacitance value would be much smaller for a given
multiplication factor due to high-frequency operation. On the other hand, if the operating frequency is
say 50 kHz for a given value of the chosen capacitance, it would be possible to use a multiplication factor
which is 10 times that possible in the case of a multiplier circuit operating at 50 Hz.
A typical He-Ne laser power supply conﬁguration built around an externally driven push-pull inverter
driving a voltage multiplier chain is shown in Figure 8.11. The controller IC used here is LM3524. Here
the components R and C determine the switching frequency. R1 and R2 constitute the voltage sense loop
whereas the R3 and R4 potential divider arrangement makes use of the internal reference of þ5 V
(available at pin 16 of the IC) to generate reference for the voltage sense loop. Any other suitable IC can
also be used with associated minor changes in the external circuit. The data sheets of these ICs come with
basic application circuits. In the absence of availability of the controller IC, the same conﬁguration could
be implemented using two 555 timer ICs or one 556 timer IC as shown in Figure 8.12.
A close examination ofthecircuitshowninFigure 8.12 reveals aninterestingvariation fromthe circuitof
Figure 8.11 on the output side. As discussed earlier, the capacitance value is chosen in order to ensure that
the power supply output voltage falls to the level of the sustaining voltage when plasma current is drawn
from the power supply. Such a circuit inherently lacks good regulation. If we choose the capacitance value
in such a way that the power supply output voltage on load is either equal to or slightly less than the open
circuit voltage, the excess voltage would need to be dropped across an additional series resistance.
In the conﬁguration of Figure 8.12, the plasma tube is initially fed from the output of the multiplier
chain. The moment the plasma is struck, the tube draws its current from a point where the push-pull
output is only doubled. The current drawn through the rest of the multiplier chain is almost negligible. In
Figure 8.11

the circuit shown, this current is of the order of 80 mA for a multiplied output voltage of 10 kV, assuming
a voltage of about 2 kV across the plasma tube.
8.4.3
Other Possible Conﬁgurations
A self-oscillating ﬂyback converter, which is inherently a constant output power DC/DC converter, is
another power supply conﬁguration particularly attractive for use with He-Ne lasers; Figure 8.13
shows the basic circuit. The converter circuit in this case is designed to deliver an output power equal to
the product of the required sustaining voltage at the power supply output and the plasma current. Since it
is a constant output power converter, the output voltage would increase without limit in the ideal case in
the event of zero current drawn from the power supply. When the output voltage exceeds the required
initiating voltage, the plasma current drawn from the power supply forces the output voltage to fall to the
sustaining voltage governed by the output power capability of the converter.
It is advisable to have a ﬁxed-value high-voltage resistor across the output as shown in the diagram.
The resistance of this resistor can be computed from R ¼ V2/W, where V is the required initiating voltage,
typically 10 kV, and W is the power output capability of the converter. This resistance would ensure that
the output voltage does not rise without limit.
Another conﬁguration depicted in Figure 8.14 makes use of an externally driven ﬂyback converter.
It generates an output voltage equal to the required sustaining voltage. The power output capability is
Figure 8.13

253

equal to the product of the sustaining voltage and the desired plasma current. A voltage feedback loop
ensures the right voltage at output. The output of the power supply feeds the plasma tube through a
ballast resistance. The ballast resistance here is split into two parts. The voltage present after the ﬁrst
resistance is used to sense the status of the plasma tube, to determine if the plasma has been struck. In
the absence of plasma, this voltage equals the power supply output voltage. In the case where the
plasma is struck, the voltage falls by an amount equal to the product of the plasma current and the
resistance value.
A fraction of this voltage is compared with a reference voltage in a comparator whose output is used to
enable or disable an astable multivibrator. The multivibrator circuit in turn triggers an SCR-based
capacitive charge/discharge circuit. In the absence of plasma, the SCR circuit generates high-voltage
pulses at a repetition rate of typically 20–30 Hz. The trigger pulses are withdrawn when the plasma is
struck.
8.4.4
Conﬁgurations for Special Applications
The design of a power supply for a laboratory use He-Ne laser is not very critical when it is mainly used
as an alignment tool. A slight variation or drift in the output power as a result of either the laser frequency
drifting across the laser Doppler-broadened gainversus frequency curve or a drift in the discharge current
makes no serious difference in such applications. However, these lasers also have applications in medical
diagnostics, spectroscopy and, above all, in the laser of a ring laser gyroscope (Figure 8.15) where power
supply design becomes highly critical.
The slow variation in the output power, particularly during the ﬁrst 10–15 minutes after switch on
due to the laser frequency varying across the Doppler gain proﬁle, is not the subject of discussion
here. Frequency-stabilized He-Ne lasers that feature an active stabilization module are also available
for certain speciﬁc applications. The variation in the output power can be checked by designing a
current-regulated power supply rather than a constant output voltage. A constant-output-voltage
power supply would deliver varying plasma current to the plasma tube with a dynamically varying
plasma impedance.
Figure 8.15
Ring laser gyroscope cavity.
254
Lasers and Optoelectronics

The basic arrangement of the power supply where the output voltage would adjust itself in order to
maintain a constant current though the plasma tube is shown in Figure 8.16. In this case, it is the plasma
current and not a fraction of the output voltage that is compared with a reference to generate an error
voltage. The error voltage in turn controls one of the parameters of the drive waveform such as pulse
width or frequency to maintain a constant discharge current. The constant value of discharge current can
be varied by varying the reference voltage. He-Ne lasers also have a tendency to degrade in output power
with the passage of time. This can be checked by using an adjustable reference that determines the
constant plasma current delivered by the power supply. This reference can be set for a little higher current
in the case where the laser output power has deteriorated. However, current should not be increased
indiscriminately as there is a well-deﬁned plasma current range within which the plasma operates most
optimally. Such a control should be used only for ﬁne adjustment.
The He-Ne ring laser of a ring laser gyroscope is one application which probably demands the
maximum in terms of stability speciﬁcations from the plasma discharge power supply. A ring laser
gyroscope, which is at the heart of inertial navigation systems used in modern aircraft and missiles,
makes use of a ring He-Ne laser in a closed cavity.
A ring laser basically has two counter-propagating helium-neon laser beams, one travelling in the
clockwise and the other travelling in the anticlockwise direction. Such a laser has two plasma arms. For
proper operation of this device, the two plasmas are operated with an exceptionally high current stability.
Not only that, it is also important to maintain a precisely constant difference in discharge current of the
two plasma arms (the reason for this is beyond the scope of the text).
Typically, a current stability in each arm of better than 1 mA in a nominal current of 5 mA and current
difference stability of better than 100 nA may be achieved from the plasma power supplies in the inertial
grade ring laser gyroscopes. The design objective of such a power supply would be to perform the twin
jobs of plasma excitation and sustenance for both arms of the ring laser plasma with the required absolute
current and current difference stability.
The other obvious objective in such an application is to achieve the highest possible conversion
efﬁciency, small size and electromagnetic compatibility, which are as important as the electrical
speciﬁcations. The preferred circuit topology for such an application is an externally driven pulse

width modulation (PWM) controlled ﬂyback converter generating a regulated output voltage equal to
the sustaining voltage at the required plasma current. This is equal to the sum of the nominal plasma
currents for the two arms and independent current stabilization loops for the two arms controlled by the
same precision reference. Another possible approach is to use a precision reference for one arm and then
use the actual controlled current ﬂowing through that arm as the reference for controlling current in the
other arm. Figure 8.17 shows one such circuit conﬁguration.
Figure 8.17

8.4.5
Ballast Resistance
As outlined in Section 8.3, the ballast resistance is a ﬁxed resistance connected from the output of the
power supply in series with the plasma tube to ensure that the power supply experiences an overall
positive resistance while feeding the plasma tube whose I–V characteristics exhibit a negative
resistance. Incorrect value of the ballast resistance leads to a highly unstable plasma that has a
tendency to extinguish. The choice of ballast resistance is therefore governed by the plasma tube for
which the power supply is being designed. The resistance typically varies over the range 50–100 kV.
Commercial He-Ne lasers with associated power supplies take this aspect into account. Plasma tube
manufactures specify the required value of the ballast resistance for the tubes manufactured by them.
If designing a power supply for a given plasma tube, it is important to consult the manufacturer’s
catalogue for this information.
Another important aspect of the ballast resistance is to connect it as close to the plasma tube electrode
as possible. Placement of the ballast resistance close to the electrode ensures that the stray capacitance is
minimized. A stray parasitic element leads to noisy plasma. If the power supply is to be housed in a
separate package, the ballast resistance is located in the plasma tube housing. The resistance should
preferably be of carbon ﬁlm or carbon composition type. If the required wattage speciﬁcation dictates
that a wire wound type is to be used, it should preferably be of the non-inductive variety and the rated
wattage of the resistor should preferably be ten times the actual power dissipated in the tube.
8.5
Carbon Dioxide Laser Power Supplies
Carbon dioxide lasers mostly operate as continuous wave lasers with power levels ranging from modest
values of a few watts, in the case of laboratory lasers and those used in biomedical applications, to several
kilowatts for industrial applications such as cutting, welding and material processing. Carbon dioxide
lasers are also used as pulsed lasers, the most common type being the TEA (transversely excited
atmospheric pressure) CO2 laser. The two most commonly used techniques for pumping carbon dioxide
lasers are:
1. DC-excited CO2 lasers
2. RF-excited CO2 lasers.
8.5.1
DC-excited CW CO2 Laser
The basic power supply for a DC-excited CW CO2 laser consists of a high-DC-voltage power supply
feeding the laser tube through a ballast resistor. The DC voltage required to produce plasma discharge
depends upon the discharge length and ﬁll pressure. The optimum magnitude of electric ﬁeld is of the
order of 30 V cm1 per torr of gas pressure. This implies that an axial ﬂow CO2 laser with 1 m of
discharge length and a gas pressure of 10 torr would need approximately 30 kV to produce plasma
discharge. Similarly, a TEA CO2 laser with discharge tube bore diameter of 1 cm would require about
23 kV (30  760 ¼ 22 800 V). A high-voltage power supply with an output DC voltage rating of several
tens of kilovolts and an output current speciﬁcation of 100 mA meets the excitation requirement of most
lasers. Figure 8.18 shows the typical set-up of a CW CO2 laser excited by a commercial power supply.
The ballast resistor limits the discharge current.
8.5.2
DC-excited Pulsed CO2 Laser
The basic power supply arrangement employed in the case of a pulsed CO2 laser such as a TEA laser is to
charge an energy storage capacitor to a high voltage from a high-voltage (HV) DC power supply and then
discharge the same through the gas mixture. The discharge process is controlled by a HV switch.
Commonly used HV switches include spark gaps, thyratron tubes and solid-state switching devices. It
may be mentioned here that the CO2 laser’s performance is not as badly affected by change in discharge
impedance during pulsed discharge as for some of the other types of gas lasers such as ion lasers and
metal vapour lasers.
Gas Laser Electronics
257

However, the discharge in the case of a TEA CO2 laser does have a tendency to break down into bright
line arcs. One way of solving this problem is to have cathode in the form of a large number of pins
(Figure 8.19), each with its ballast resistor in series with it. The ballast resistors limit the current through
their respective pins and therefore inhibit any arc formation.
Present-day TEA CO2 lasers use Marx bank capacitor systems, where the arrangement of individual
capacitors is such that they are in parallel during the charging process and in series during the discharge
operation. This means if each capacitor in the bank were charged to a voltage V, then the total voltage
available across the tube for discharge operation would be nV, n being the number of capacitors.
Figure 8.20 shows one such Marx bank supply conﬁguration.
In the arrangement of Figure 8.20, switches are open during the charging operation. They are triggered
simultaneously to the closed position to initiate discharge. Although the Marx bank of Figure 8.20 uses
four stages, Marx bank systems with a higher number of stages are also used. Marx banks are particularly
suitable for producing fast-rising pulses.
Figure 8.18
DC-excited CW CO2 laser power supply set-up.
Figure 8.19

258
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Modern TEA CO2 lasers generally use a double-discharge approach. In this case, a low-energy
discharge ﬁrst preionises the gas mixture, which is then followed by main discharge. This method
increases the probability of discharge plasma forming throughout the volume of the gas mixture and also
improves the stability and uniformity of the discharge.
8.5.3
RF-excited CO2 Lasers
Transverse RF excitation of CO2 lasers offers some distinct advantages over DC excitation.
These include the following.
1. RF excitation has enabled new laser device architectures due to the ability to control RF discharge
over very large areas of all-metal electrodes at high power densities in relatively simple device
structures. This has provided compact sealed-off high-average-power lasers.
2. RF discharges can be switched at much higher frequencies than DC discharges. This provides greater
ﬂexibility to the user in terms of temporal formats, which is a crucial requirement for many material
processing applications.
3. It allows all-metal construction, which makes cooling more effective.
4. High electrode voltages are avoided, extending the life of the laser.
The typical excitation source comprises an RF source and an impedance-matching network. The RF
source may be split into an RF oscillator and a cascade arrangement of RF ampliﬁers, depending upon
the output power delivering capability. Frequency of operation is in the range of 50–150 MHz. RF power
is fed to the laser cavity through an impedance-matching network. The laser cavity’s mechanical
structure combined with RF discharge can be considered as an electrical load comprising complex
impedance. Power transfer efﬁciency from the RF source to the discharge is a key operational feature of
the laser that is made more complicated by the fact that the discharge impedance is power dependent.

8.6
Power Supplies for Metal Vapour Lasers
Metal vapour lasers are categorized in two broad classes: the helium-cadmium family of lasers where the
ionized cadmium atoms constitute the active species, and the second class where neutral atoms constitute
the lasing species. Copper vapour and gold vapour lasers are the predominant candidates of the second
category of metal vapour lasers. While the former type operates as CW lasers, the latter are essentially
pulsed lasers.
The basic power supply arrangement for CW metal vapour lasers such as helium-cadmium lasers is
similar to that discussed in the case of helium-neon lasers. In the case of pulsed metal vapour lasers such
as copper vapour and gold vapour lasers, the basic power supply would be similar to that discussed in the
case of TEA CO2 lasers. Figure 8.22 shows the basic power supply for a pulsed metal vapour laser. The
energy storage capacitor is charged through the inductor and then discharged through the laser tube by
triggering the thyratron switch to the closed state.
Figure 8.23 shows the preferred power supply conﬁguration for pulsed metal vapour lasers. In
this case, the energy storage capacitor is charged to a relatively much lower voltage than is required
across the discharge tube. The capacitor is made to discharge through the primary of the step-up pulse
transformer by triggering the switch connected in series with the primary of the pulse transformer to
the closed state. The discharge circuit is a multi-mesh pulse-forming network comprising saturable
inductors. The pulse-forming network acts like a magnetic pulse-compression circuit. It shortens the

discharge pulse duration from a few microseconds to about 100–150 ns. This conﬁguration leads to
improved conversion efﬁciency, as the reduced pulse duration is much better matched to the require-
ments of the discharge. Also, use of a pulse transformer allows the capacitor to be charged to relatively
lower voltage, allowing the use of solid-state switching devices. Due to the reduced quantum of energy
being stored in the capacitor, the lifetime of the switch also increases.
8.7
Power Supplies for Excimer Lasers
Excimer lasers are pumped either by pulsed electric discharge or by high-energy electron beams. Those
excited by high-energy electron beams are capable of producing very high pulse energy of the order of
tens of kilojoules. Such giant lasers ﬁnd applications in areas such as laser-assisted thermonuclear fusion
and defence research. Detailed discussion on this form of excitation is beyond the scope of the present
text. On the other hand, electrically excited excimer lasers are relatively much smaller and far less
expensive. These ﬁnd use in a large number of industrial applications such as semiconductor fabrication,
material processing and photochemistry.
Excimer lasers are excited by short-duration high-peak-current discharge pulses with pulse rise time of
the order of tens of nanoseconds and a peak value of discharge current pulse in the range of a few kiloamps.
Excitation of the active medium is usually a two-stage process. Energy is stored in a capacitor in a
relatively slow process in one part of the circuit and then transferred to a peaking capacitor that enables a
much faster discharge in another part of the circuit. Figure 8.24 depicts one such power supply circuit.
In the circuit of Figure 8.24, C is the charging capacitor. Stored energy is transferred to the peaking
capacitor Cp across the pre-ionization spark gap. The basic circuit is adequate for excimer lasers with
moderate values of pulse energy and repetition rate for the following reasons. When the discharge is
initiated, voltage across the tube rises very rapidly. As it reaches the breakdown voltage, current begins to
ﬂow. Increasing current leads to a rapid fall in voltage due to the negative resistance characteristics of
discharge. As a result, electrons in the discharge plasma cannot be accelerated to the velocities required
to excite the lasing species. This forces the designer to store and switch more than the required energy,
leading to a reduction in the efﬁciency and lifetime of the thyratron switch.
Commercial excimer laser power supplies employ a modiﬁed circuit where the charging part of
the circuit is decoupled from the fast discharge part of the circuit. One such circuit, where the
decoupling between charge and discharge parts of the circuit is provided by a saturable inductor, is
shown in Figure 8.25.
Another circuit using a peaking capacitor that is internal to the laser enclosure close to the main
electrodes is shown in Figure 8.26. When the peaking capacitor is located internal to the laser housing,
it not only minimizes the number of feedthroughs into the enclosure but also allows the designer to have a
discharge circuit with low inductance producing faster rise time discharge pulses.

Power Supplies for Ion Lasers
Gas lasers discussed so far in this chapter including helium-neon, carbon dioxide, excimer and metal
vapour lasers which operate at high voltage and relatively lower current. In contrast, noble gas ion lasers
operate at relatively lower voltages of the order of 200 V and much higher current values in the range
10–100 A. This is evident from the current–voltage characteristics of a typical gas discharge discussed
earlier and shown in Figure 8.2. The excitation mechanism in ion lasers is electron impact in the gas in a
DC discharge with high current density in the range of several hundreds of amps per squared centimetre.
In some cases such as the argon ion laser, a high value of current density is maintained by using a
magnetic ﬁeld that conﬁnes the discharge. Operation at high current density means that there a suitable
arrangement to transfer heat out of the tube is necessary and that the tube is fabricated from materials
which can withstand such hostile operating conditions. Another requirement is that of maintaining
uniform gas pressure in the tube, which is achieved by using a pressure sensor and a gas ﬁll regulator. In
addition, the power supply circuit needs to have the feedback control loops to operate the laser either in
the constant-output-power or in the constant-discharge-current mode.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

It may be mentioned here that it is the current regulator rather than voltage regulation that is
implemented while designing the power supply for argon/krypton ion lasers. It is because of this reason
that the incremental resistance of the discharge is very low of the order of a few ohms. This implies that a
small change in voltage across the discharge will result in a relatively large change in the discharge
current. Discharge current regulation therefore makes more sense.
Figure 8.27 shows the generalized block schematic arrangement of a typical ion laser power supply
along with auxiliary circuits. Depending upon the output power level, discharge current in the case of ion
lasers could be of the order of several tens of amps. The block schematic shown is that of a conventional
current-regulated AC/DC power supply. While a DC voltage of the order of 200 V is needed to sustain a
steady discharge in an ion laser, it needs a higher voltage of the order of a few kilovolts to initiate the
discharge. This is provided by the starter circuit with the high-voltage trigger transformer located inside
the laser head. The line switch is simply a kind of circuit breaker operated by protection circuits such as
over current limit and over temperature cut-off.
In the case of modern ion lasers, the linearly current-regulated conventional AC/DC supply of
Figure 8.27 may be replaced by a switched-mode power supply based on buck-boost topology. The
inverted polarity available from the buck-boost topology allows easy connection to the cathode terminal.
The anode terminal is generally used for applying the starting voltage. The ion laser power supplies also
have auxiliary circuits for control of gas-ﬁll valves and monitoring of gas pressure.

Frequency Stabilization of Gas Lasers
In this section we present a comparative study of the techniques available for frequency stabilization of
carbon dioxide lasers. Different techniques commonly used for frequency stabilization of carbon dioxide
lasers include:
1. dither stabilization
2. stark-cell stabilization
Figure 8.27

3. optogalvanic stabilization
4. stabilization by conventional saturation absorption dip
5. stabilization by stark saturation absorption cell.
8.9.1
Dither Stabilization
Figure 8.28 shows the typical experimental arrangement for a dither stabilization scheme. The grating
allows selection of various lines within the laser tuning curve. The output of the low-frequency oscillator
when applied to the lead zirconate titanate (PZT) moves the grating along the axis and hence varies the
output frequency. This is called dithering. As a result, the laser output is detected and fed to a
synchronous detector. The other input to the synchronous detector is the dithering signal that acts as the
reference. The output of the synchronous detector is the error signal, which corresponds to the deviation
in the laser output frequency from the line centre. In fact, the magnitude and phase of the error signal
determine the location of operational point with respect to the centre of the Doppler-broadened gain
curve. While the amplitude determines how far or close to the line centre the operational point is, the
phase determines which side of the line centre it is located. As is evident from Figure 8.29, if the

Lasers and Optoelectronics

instantaneous frequency or wavelength of the laser corresponds to point A located on the positive slope
of the gain curve, the output of the photodiode corresponding to an applied sinusoidal dither signal
(Dither signal 1) has the same phase. On the other hand, if the instantaneous frequency or wavelength of
the laser corresponds to point B on the negative slope of the gain curve, the photodiode signal is 180  out
of phase with the applied dither signal (Dither signal 2).
The amplitude of the photodiode signals in the two cases depends upon the slope of the gain curve at
the point of interest. The closer the point is to the line centre, the smaller the amplitude of photodiode
signal. The biggest disadvantage of this technique is the presence of frequency modulation in the output
as a result of laser dithering.
There are however other techniques that overcome this shortcoming, where it is not the laser but an
external gas-cell that is dithered to generate the error signal. As a result, the frequency modulation is
absent from the output. These other techniques are described in the following sections.
8.9.2
Stark-cell Stabilization
Figure 8.30 shows the typical block schematic arrangement for stark-cell stabilization. A part of the
output laser beam is made to pass through the stark cell. An appropriate value of DC voltage is applied to
one of the stark plates to make the stark-shifted molecular transition of the gas contained in the cell
precisely coincide with the CO2 laser output line of interest. A slowly varying linear voltage ramp may be
applied instead. An audio-frequency waveform (typically 5 kHz), either sinusoidal or square, is
superimposed on this. The other stark plate is grounded. The beam at the output of the stark cell is
thus modulated in both amplitude and frequency by the applied high-frequency signal (5 kHz or so)
around the line of interest. The beam is detected and fed to a lock-in ampliﬁer for phase-sensitive
detection of the signal. This synchronous detection produces a frequency-discriminant error signal. The
error signal is ampliﬁed and then fed back to the PZT through a suitable interface. One of the end-
elements of the cavity is mounted on the PZT. The error signal adjusts the length of the cavity in the
feedback mode to lock the laser frequency to the centre of the Doppler proﬁle of the line of interest.
The biggest advantage of this technique stems from the fact that it is not the laser but the stark cell that
has been dithered for generating the frequency-discriminant error signal. As a consequence, the
troublesome frequency modulation present in the frequency-stabilized output in the case of the former
is absent from the stark-cell stabilization scheme.
8.9.3
Optogalvanic Stabilization
The carbon dioxide laser is a high-efﬁciency device and the intensity of laser radiation ﬁeld is often
sufﬁciently large to cause signiﬁcant variation in many of the laser and discharge macroscopic
Figure 8.30

parameters when there is a change in the ﬁeld intensity. Parameters such as the spontaneous side light
intensity and its spectral distribution, gas pressure, discharge current and discharge impedance all change
as the internal laser radiation ﬁeld intensity is altered, for instance by using an intra-cavity modulator or
by changing the resonant cavity alignment.
In a typical set-up, the laser cavity length is modulated at some convenient frequency by oscillating the
position of one mirror along the cavity axis using a piezoelectric mirror mount. The ﬁeld intensity is
therefore modulated at the same frequency as the cavity mode scans the transition line gain proﬁle. An
intensity variation of about 10% is sufﬁcient to change the discharge impedance by about 0.1%. This
impedance change can be detected as a current ﬂuctuation (in which case the effect is called opto-
galvanic) or as a voltage variation (opto-voltaic). If the mean frequency was lower than the line-centre
frequency, the phase of impedance ﬂuctuation is opposite to that if the mean frequency was higher than
the line-centre frequency. The amplitude of impedance ﬂuctuation increases with the increasing
frequency offset from the line centre. If the impedance ﬂuctuation is measured with a phase-sensitive
detection system and its integrated output suitably ampliﬁed and applied to the cavity length transducer
as a DC correction signal, the system will maintain the oscillating cavity mode at the line centre.
Figure 8.31 depicts a typical opto-galvanic frequency stabilization set-up. An AC signal is applied to
the cavity length transducer, resulting in frequency modulation of the laser and therefore modulation of
the plasma-tube impedance. The impedance variation which is proportional to the slope of the output
power versus frequency curve of the laser is measured by exciting the plasma-tube by a high-speed
current-regulated power supply and measuring the resulting variation in voltage drop across the plasma
tube. This voltage is applied to the synchronous detector. The other input to the synchronous detector is
the reference signal used to modulate the laser cavity length with the help of PZT. The error signal
produced at the output of the synchronous detector is used to stabilize the laser frequency.
8.9.4
Stabilization using Saturation Absorption Dip
From the viewpoint of electronics set-up required for frequency stabilization of Doppler-broadened gas
lasers, this approach is no different from that of the extra-cavity stark cell described in Section 8.9.2. In
the present approach however, the absorption cell is placed in such a way that a saturation absorption dip
(i.e. inverted lamb dip) is obtained on the Doppler-broadened gain versus frequency gain proﬁle. The
laser is then locked onto the centre of this inverted lamb dip. In the case of stark-cell stabilization, the
laser is locked to the centre of the Doppler proﬁle, taking advantage of the extreme narrowness of
saturation absorption dip; an extremely high degree of frequency stabilization can then be achieved.

extra-cavity absorption cell. The arrangement is self-explanatory.

Summary
 Most gas lasers are driven by electrical discharge through the laser gas mixture. The discharge is struck
either longitudinally by passing electrical current along the length of the discharge tube (longitudinal
excitation) or perpendicular to the length of the tube by passing electric current transverse to the length
of the tube (transverse excitation).
 The negative discharge impedance offered by the plasma is given by the reciprocal of the slope of the
tangent drawn at the operating point in the I–V characteristics.
 Pre-breakdown current is the discharge current that ﬂows before breakdown voltage is reached. It
increases slowly with an increase in applied voltage until breakdown point is reached.
 At breakdown voltage, a large number of molecules in the gas mixture become ionized. The
conductivity of the gas mixture increases. Electrons are accelerated to velocities where they transfer
energy to more molecules through collisions. Increase in discharge current causes a further reduction
in discharge resistance with the result that the voltage required to sustain the discharge actually
decreases with increase in current.
 Ballast resistance is a ﬁxed resistor connected from the output of the power supply in series with the
plasma tube to ensure that the power supply experiences an overall positive resistance while feeding
the plasma tube whose I–V characteristics exhibit a negative resistance. The resistance typically varies
between 50 kV and 100 kV.
 Buck-boost topology produces an output voltage that can either be of higher magnitude (in the case of
boost topology) or lower magnitude (in the case of buck topology) than the input voltage. The polarity
of the output voltage is inverted from that of the input.
 TEA CO2 laser is a carbon dioxide laser where the gas is ﬁlled at atmospheric pressure and the
discharge is transversely excited.
 Dither stabilization is a technique for frequency stabilization of Doppler-broadened gas lasers. In this
technique, one of the mirrors of the laser cavity is mounted on a PZT, which allows it to be dithered (or
moved along the axis). The frequency modulation and consequent amplitude modulation of the output
signal is used to generate an error discriminant. The error discriminant in the feedback loop is used to
stabilize the laser at the line centre. The disadvantage of the technique is the presence of incidental
frequency modulation (FM), even in the frequency-stabilized output.

 Optogalvanic stabilization is a technique for frequency stabilization of gas lasers. In this technique,
one of the mirrors of the laser cavity is dithered as in the case of dither stabilization. However, in the
case of optogalvanic stabilization, impedance ﬂuctuations resulting from cavity dithering are
measured by using a constant current source. The resultant voltage signal acts as a discriminant
that is used in the feedback loop to stabilize the laser.
 Stark-cell stabilization is a technique for frequency stabilization of Doppler-broadened gas lasers. It is
not the laser but the stark cell that is dithered to generate the discriminant. The troublesome frequency
modulation present in the frequency-stabilized output in the case of Dither stabilization is therefore
absent in the case of a stark-cell stabilization scheme.

Laser Diode Electronics

Introduction
Laser diode electronics primarily comprises a source of drive current and a temperature controller. The
wavelength of a semiconductor diode laser is strongly dependent on drive current and operating
temperature. The stability of the drive current and operating temperature therefore dictates the output
wavelength stability. The large signiﬁcance of current and temperature control is such that many
international companies offer a laser diode driver and temperature controller in a single package.
Not all laser diode applications have the stringent requirements of ultra-stable wavelength, necessi-
tating a high degree of current and temperature stabilization. Applications such as data storage and
retrieval, laser printing and laser pointing only require the conventional advantages of lasers. In the case
laser diodes to be used for spectroscopy, biomedical diagnostics, pollution monitoring and characteri-
zation of materials however, a tight control on both the drive current and the diode temperature is
essential.
In addition, laser diodes are highly prone to damage due to excessive drive current and transients. A
laser diode drive circuit should not only provide a stabilized drive current, but it should also have inbuilt
protection features. In this chapter we discuss the common mechanisms of laser damage and the
precautions to be observed to protect them. This is followed by a discussion on different topologies
commonly used for the design of laser diode drive circuits and temperature controllers to meet the
requirements of different applications.
9.2
Laser Diode Protection
Laser diodes exhibit excellent reliability under ideal operating conditions, with lifetimes often exceeding
100 000 hours. However, they are highly susceptible to damage due to excessive drive current, electro-
static discharge (ESD) and transients. Laser diode damage manifests itself in the form of: reduced output
power; a shift in threshold current; an increase in beam divergence; and failure to laser action, thus
producing an LED-like output only. A laser diode protection strategy needs to be multi-pronged with
desired focus on laser diode instrumentation, system set-up, power line conditioning and laser diode
handling. Laser diode instrumentation includes the current source used to drive the laser diode and
temperature controller. The relevant damage mechanisms are over-current, overheating, current spikes
and power line surges. System set-up considerations include cables, proper grounding and shielding;
improper set-up leads to radiated electrical transients. Improper power line conditioning also leads to
severe fast transients. Electrostatic discharge caused by improper handling during storage, transport and
mounting is considered as the single leading cause of premature laser diode failure. Note that typical
laser diodes have rise times in the range of tens of picoseconds, and are therefore highly sensitive to fast
events. The four areas of laser diode protection strategy are brieﬂy described in the following sections.

9.2.1
Laser Diode Drive and Control
Laser diode instrumentation includes the current source used to drive the laser diode and the
temperature controller used to maintain a constant operating temperature regardless of the ambient
conditions. The current source should be designed in order to provide an independent adjustable limit of
the drive current, guard against the diode junction becoming reverse biased and suppress both power line
and current transients. A temperature-control circuit should not allow the current driving thermoelectric
module used to control the temperature to exceed its maximum rated value. The temperature-control
feedback loop should guard against any thermal oscillations. Note that many important laser diode
operating parameters such as operating wavelength, threshold current, electrical input to laser output
efﬁciency and lifetime are strongly dependent upon operating temperature and temperature stability.
Protection features desirable for a laser diode current source include slow start, current limit, over-
voltage protection and power line transient suppression. Commercial laser diode drivers maintain a short
circuit across the output leads to which the laser diode is to be connected by using a shorting relay or a
ﬁeld effect transistor (FET) switch. The shorting is maintained until the output is turned on and also when
power to the instrument is off. Shorted output provides protection against ESD damage. Figure 9.1 shows
the basic topology of a laser diode current source with protection features.
Slow start protects the laser diode from turn-on transients by forcing the drive current through the laser
diode to rise slowly to the ﬁnal operating value. The start-up time is typically longer than 100
milliseconds. Start-up time ensures that the control circuits are fully active and circuit transients
have died out before the drive current reaches its operating value.
The current source should have an inbuilt adjustable current limit that is effective irrespective of
whether it is operated in DC, pulsed or constant-power-output modes. The current limit should
preferably be independent which when set overrides any other condition that can lead to the drive
current exceeding the maximum limit of the device. Excessive drive current leads to what is called
catastrophic facet damage (CFD). Damage to the diode at the output facet usually occurs when the
optical energy density exceeds 10 000 W mm2. In a typical laser diode, the area of emitting surface for
a given output laser power is such that the power density at the output facet is of the order of
500–700 W mm2. Although the material of the active region is transparent in the pumped part of the
active region, due to non-radiative combination it becomes absorbing at the facet surface. Temperature
rises faster than normal and this temperature increase produces further increase in absorption at the

Lasers and Optoelectronics

surface, which leads to a further rise in temperature. This thermal runaway occurrence causes damage to
the facet and/or facet coating.
Over-voltage protection is another important feature to be built into the current source designed to
drive a laser diode. A constant current source can maintain a constant current through a load only up to a
certain voltage across the load, known as compliance voltage. If the load impedance was to suddenly
drop, the current control loop would drive the output current to short-circuit limit. The laser diode in this
case will be overdriven for a brief period of time until the feedback control circuit adjusts itself to reduce
the drive voltage. This short-term overdrive is generally sufﬁcient to damage the device. Laser diode
current source should be designed in order to guard against this condition.
Power line transients originate from a variety of sources, which include poor power conditioning,
electronic equipment using switched-mode power supplies and computers. The laser diode driver and
temperature controller should be designed in order to efﬁciently suppress transients that make their way
to the power input stage. An appropriate combination of ﬁlters could do the job. However, it may not be
possible to prevent transients that are radiatively coupled into the laser or drive cables.
The protection needs of the temperature controller are also very stringent. The laser diode lifetime is
inversely proportional to the operating temperature. The lifetime has been observed to improve by an
order of magnitude for every 30 C reduction in the laser diode case temperature as shown in Figure 9.2.
There is therefore a great motivation to operate laser diodes at as low a temperature as possible. The
output wavelength is also a strong function of junction temperature which, in turn, depends on the
environmental temperature, power dissipated at the junction and relevant thermal resistances. Wave-
length shifts by 0.4 nm for each unit change in temperature. Heat removal could make use of passive

techniques where, at best, the case temperature can equal the ambient temperature or active techniques
where there is no such limitation.
A thermoelectric (TE) module (also called Peltier cooler) temperature controller is used when the
application demands a high degree of temperature stability. The current limit for the TE module should
always be set below its maximum rating. Thermal oscillations should be avoided by setting the gain of
the temperature controller’s feedback loop appropriately. The chosen TE module should have a high
current rating and the current limit for the TE module drive circuit should be set just above the operating
value.
To summarize, a laser diode drive circuit should be a current source and not a voltage source. The
current source should have inbuilt protection features such as shorting output, independently adjustable
current limit, over-voltage protection, slow start and immunity to transients. Current limit should be set
with due consideration to recommendations of laser diode manufacturer. In the absence of any speciﬁc
guideline on the desirable current limit, it should be set just above the expected maximum operating
current. A laser diode mount should have an adequate heat sinking capability and must not allow the laser
diode to go to thermal runaway. The laser diode should be operated at the lowest temperature possible,
dependent upon the type of laser diode and intended application.
9.2.2
Interconnection Cables and Grounding
Use of proper cabling and grounding methodology is crucial in determining the susceptibility of laser
diode instrumentation (laser diode driver, temperature controller) to radiated noise. The main sources of
radiated noise include transformers, ﬂuorescent lights, switched-mode power supplies, high-speed data
communication channels, motorized equipment and lightning discharge. Identiﬁcation of all possible
coupling mechanisms of the radiated transient noise, which in turn determines the radiated susceptibility,
is usually a difﬁcult proposition. Primary concerns however remain improper mounting, cabling and
grounding methodologies. It may be noted here that the proper laser diode mounting, the correct choice
of cable type and routing and grounding practice are also important.
The ﬁrst and foremost precaution to be observed in the case of cabling is to make sure that the laser
diode driver is turned off prior to connecting the laser diode. A loose cable connection could be very
dangerous. An intermittent or bouncing cable connection is interpreted by the laser diode driver as an
intermittent high impedance load, with the result that it tries to drive the laser diode harder.
Both twisted-pair and shielded cables can be used, depending upon the application requirement. A
twisted-pair cable is preferred in the case of long cable runs due to the reduction in loop area and
consequently the inductive term in the coupling equation, which helps in reducing the low frequency
noise that would have inductively coupled into the system. Note that a twisted-pair cable offers
practically no resistance to high-frequency noise, as the coupling mechanism in this case is capacitive.
Use of a shielded cable helps in this case, but alone is not enough. Improper shield termination often
limits its effectiveness. The shield on the cable provides a low-resistance path for the high-frequency
noise to ground. As a result of this, it not only restricts radiation of energy from the internal conductor but
more importantly it prevents high-frequency noise radiated by other sources of noise becoming coupled
into the system. It therefore signiﬁcantly improves both radiated emission as well as radiated
susceptibility performance.
A cable shield should never be used as a current-carrying conductor. Both ends of the shield should
preferably be terminated with a low-inductance ground. In the case of a ground loop formation leading to
possible inductive coupling of low-frequency noise, one of the ends of the shield (preferable on the diode
mount side) should be connected to ground through a capacitor of a few hundred picofarads. The
capacitor serves the purpose of breaking the loop for low-frequency noise signals while maintaining a
low-impedance path for high-frequency noise signals.
A laser diode mount also plays an important role in overall noise performance. If the mount is not
properly grounded and/or the radiation environment is extremely harsh, the mount itself might act as an
antenna and couple radiated noise signals from external sources into the system. A laser diode mount
should be selected with due consideration to the type of laser diode package.
274
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Grounding in the context of laser diode instrumentation serves two purposes. The ﬁrst is to reference
the laser diode with respect to ground and the second is to provide a return path for the device current.
Ground loops should be avoided; ideally, a single-point ground connection should be used. If multiple
ground nodes are unavoidable, the ground loop current should be minimized. With reference to the
second requirement, the laser return path should not used as a return path for other circuits. The ﬁnal
implementation of grounding methodology is a compromise between the two conﬂicting requirements of
avoiding ground loops and providing low-inductance high-frequency grounds to suppress fast transients.
Multiple low-inductance ground connections are preferred when confronted mainly with high-frequency
noise. If low-frequency noise is a bigger worry, a single-point ground connection is preferred.
To summarize, with reference to mounting, cabling and grounding requirements, the laser diode return
path should be kept separate from other current paths as far as possible. Ground loops should be avoided
and appropriate shielded cables that are properly fastened and terminated should be used to minimize
radiated emission and susceptibility. Laser diode mounts should not couple the radiated noise into the
system.
9.2.3
Transient Suppression
Laser diodes are highly prone to damage due to all types of electromagnetic interference including fast
transients. These transients are caused by equipment such as soldering irons, motors and compressors
which require large power line surge currents and systems such as computers using switched-mode
power supplies. Although the use of shielded cables and proper grounding helps to accommodate
radiated transients, fast transients often beat the best defences. Immunity to fast transients can be further
improved by avoiding sharing power lines used for laser diode driver with other equipment. Isolation
transformers or/and surge suppressors should be used on the power line. If forced to share the power line
with other equipment, ensure that a separate surge protector is used for the laser diode driver.
9.2.4
Electrostatic Discharge
To ensure efﬁcient and reliable operation of a laser diode throughout its lifetime, proper handling of laser
diodes (e.g. during storage, transport and mounting) is no less important than the design requirements of
laser diode instrumentation discussed in the previous sections. Electrostatic discharge is considered as
the single-most predominant cause of premature device failure. AlGaAs and InGaAsP laser diodes may
be highly prone to damage by ESD voltages as low as 1200 V. Figure 9.3 depicts laser power output
versus drive current characteristics of a typical InGaAsP laser diode for different values of reverse-biased
Figure 9.3

ESD stress. As is evident from the family of curves shown in Figure 9.3, there is an onset of failure at
1400 V. More often than not, ESD causes latent damage to the laser diode without any immediate visible
symptoms. Consequent performance degradation may appear long after the initial occurrence of the
damage-causing ESD.
Laser diodes can be protected from ESD damage by taking certain precautions while handling laser
diodes. The use of anti-static gloves, wrist straps and clothing and grounded soldering stations and other
equipment are strongly recommended. Also recommended is the use of anti-static ﬂoor coverings,
ionized air blowers and dissipative work surfaces. Charge-generating materials must be kept at least
30 cm away from the laser diode to prevent charge accumulation due to inductive coupling. When not in
use and during transportation and storage, laser diodes should be fully enclosed in a conductive material.
Laser diode pins also should be kept shorted when not in use by inserting them into conductive foam.
9.3
Operational Modes
Characteristics such as operating wavelength, threshold current, slope efﬁciency and lifetime of a laser
diode, as outlined in Section 9.2.1, are strongly dependent on the temperature of the laser diode chip. In
addition, operating wavelength is also dependent on the drive current. Optical power output is observed
to be inversely proportional to the chip temperature. Operating wavelength for a typical AlGaAs laser
diode varies directly at a rate of 0.25 nm C1. Operating wavelength also changes at a rate of
0.025 nm mA1 of drive current. Further, in the case of a single-mode laser diode, change in wavelength
leads to mode-hopping phenomenon.
Laser diodes are operated in either of the two operating modes: (a) constant-current mode and (b)
constant-output-power mode. In the case of the former, the drive current to the laser diode is maintained
constant irrespective of variations in the source of power input. Circuit topology used to achieve
constancy of drive current varies from using a simple band-gap reference-controlled current source
driven from a regulated DC voltage to using a feedback loop that continuously monitors the drive current
and applies appropriate correction in the case of drive current deviating from the desired value.
Requirements on the part of current stability are also governed by maximum acceptable frequency/
wavelength variation. For example, laser diodes used for pointing and printing applications may not
require drive current stabilization to high precision. On the other hand, devices used for tele-
communication or spectroscopy applications have very stringent requirements on drive current stabili-
zation. Assuming a typical ﬁgure of 0.025 nm mA1 (which is equivalent to a frequency variation of
15 GHz mA1 at 700 nm output wavelength) and a nominal drive current of 100 mA (which is reasonable
for laser diodes used for telecommunications and spectroscopy applications), 1 mA variation would
cause a 15 MHz shift in frequency. A stability of 1 mA in 100 mA is equivalent to 10 ppm. Circuit
design and the choice of components must therefore take such requirements into account. For instance,
all circuit components should have drift speciﬁcations far better than the actual stability required.
9.3.1
Constant-current Mode
In view of important characteristic parameters of the laser diode being dependent on operating
temperature and drive current, the preferred mode of operation of a laser diode is the constant drive
current with precise control of operating temperature. Constant-current operation without temperature
control is generally not desirable. Even at constant drive current, output power would increase with a
decrease in operating temperature. With a signiﬁcant decrease in temperature, output power could easily
go past the absolute maximum value.
The circuit topology in the case of constant-current mode of operation is usually conﬁgured around a
current sensing element that continuously senses the drive current and produces a proportional voltage.
This is then compared to a reference voltage representing the desired value of drive current to generate
the error signal. After suitable conditioning, the error signal is then fed back to restore the drive current to
the desired value. Figure 9.4 shows the basic schematic arrangement of a constant-current drive circuit.
Practical circuits with inbuilt protection features are far more complex. Several constant-current drive
circuit topologies are discussed in Section 9.4.1.
276
Lasers and Optoelectronics

9.3.2
Constant-power Mode
There are applications where constant output power is more relevant. When a laser diode is driven by a
constant current, the heat dissipated at the laser diode junction leads to a rise in temperature and hence a
fall in output power. An increase in temperature could be because of an absence of any active temperature
control mechanism or even inadequacy of heat sink in the presence of active temperature control. This
reduction in output power can be compensated for by increasing the drive current. The current source can
be designed in such a way that it adjusts the drive current in a feedback mode to maintain a constant
output power instead of maintaining a constant drive current. Laser diode modules with an integral
photodiode suit this operational mode well.
Constant-power mode also precludes the possibility of the output power increasing with a decrease in
operating temperature. The basic circuit topology of a constant-output-power drive circuit, as shown in
Figure 9.5, is similar to that of a constant-current drive circuit except for the nature of sense signal. In the
case of constant-output-power mode, the sense signal is photocurrent, which is proportional to the output
power. It may be mentioned here that constant-output-power mode may lead to the thermal-runaway
situation, thus damaging the laser diode if operated without an absolute current limit. Noise intrinsic to

277

the integral photodiode also manifests itself in the form of noisy and unstable output in the case of
constant-power mode of operation.
To summarize, operating a laser diode at a constant drive current with precise temperature control
should always be the preferred option, more so when the laser diode is intended for applications such as
spectroscopy, pollution monitoring, biomedical diagnostics and characterization of materials. Automatic
power control may be resorted to if precise temperature control is not practical and constancy of output
power is highly desirable.
9.4
Laser Diode Driver Circuits
In this section we describe some representative laser diode driver circuits for both constant-current and
constant-power modes of operation. In the constant-current mode of operation, the primary objective is
to provide a stable drive current to the laser diode. The drive current is continuously sensed and any
deviation in the drive current is corrected for by changing the voltage controlling the drive current. In the
case of constant-power mode, the drive current to the laser diode is continuously adjusted to maintain
constant output power. As the output power increases or decreases, the drive current is decreased or
increased to maintain a constant output power.
Irrespective of the operational mode however, certain protection features such as independently
adjustable current limit, slow start, immunity to transients and other forms of interference need to be
incorporated into laser diode driver design. As already outlined in Section 9.2, laser diodes are highly
prone to damage or performance deterioration due to transient conditions, the current exceeding a
speciﬁed upper limit and radiated noise present in the environment.
In the following sections we describe some basic laser diode drive circuits. Beginning with the most
basic constant-current source, drive circuits with inbuilt feedback control for both constant-current as
well as constant-power modes of operation are discussed. A large number of integrated circuits are also
available that are capable of driving laser diodes in either of the two modes of operation. These integrated
circuits, available from leading international manufacturers of digital and linear integrated circuits, have
the necessary building blocks to offer the desired protection features in addition to providing the required
drive current. These integrated circuits usually drive the relatively low-power laser diodes directly. In the
case of high-power laser diodes, output of the integrated circuit drives an output stage which in turn
provides the necessary drive to the laser diode.
9.4.1
Basic Constant-current Source
Figure 9.6 shows a simple circuit providing a constant current drive to the laser diode; this is one of the
circuits which all electronics engineers are familiar with. The Zener diode ensures a constant voltage
at the base of the PNP transistor with the result that the voltage at the emitter terminal VE ¼ VZ þ 0:6V
is also constant. The diode current ID ¼ ðV  VEÞ=R2 which approximately equals the emitter current is
constant, provided V and R2 are constant. The choice of VZ in the circuit is dictated by the desired value of
VE which, in turn, equals ð1:5 þ VCEÞ V. The typical voltage drop across the laser diode when forward-
biased as shown in the typical I–V characteristics of Figure 9.7 is 1.5 V. VCE is chosen in order to operate
the transistor in the centre of the active region of its output characteristics. Having determined VE, VZ is
given by ðVE  0:6Þ V. R2 can be computed from the known values of VE and the desired drive current. R2
can be varied to change the drive current.
The circuit shown in Figure 9.6 is seldom used in practice for the simple reason that it is probably too
simple and inﬂexible to allow incorporation of other desired features such as current modulation,
protection features and feedback mode of operation. One of the preferred conﬁgurations for driving laser
diodes is shown in Figure 9.8.
This circuit has several advantages over the drive circuit of Figure 9.6. The drive current in this case is
independent of any variation in transistor parameters. The circuit can be easily adapted to incorporate the
modulation input if needed.
278
Lasers and Optoelectronics

The voltage VE at the emitter terminal of the transistor VE ¼ VRef  R2=ðR1 þ R2Þ and hence the drive
current (¼ ðV  VEÞ=R3) is held constant. VRef can be generated by using a band-gap reference and R1,
R2 and R3 can be precision metal-ﬁlm resistors. Drive current can be varied by varying R2.
Laser diode driver circuit of Figure 9.8 provides a constant-current drive to the laser diode only if the
DC supply V and VRef are constant. If VRef is a band-gap reference and R1, R2 and R3 are precision
resistors, it would be safe to assume VRef as constant. The same might not be true for V; any variation in V
manifests itself as a change in drive current.
9.4.2
Laser Diode Driver with Feedback Control
Figure 9.9 shows another voltage-controlled constant-current laser diode driver in which the drive
current is independent of variation in the DC supply used for active devices. Laser diode current is sensed
differentially by measuring voltage drop across RSense wired in series with the laser diode. The drive
current is controlled by the input voltage VIn, which could be generated with a band-gap reference. If the

drive circuit is to be controlled digitally, VIn could be provided by a voltage output digital-to-analogue
converter. Drive current can be computed from Equations 9.1 and 9.2:
IO  RSense ¼ VIn  R4
R3
(9.1)
IO ¼ VIn  R4
R3  RSense
(9.2)
R1 ¼ R3 and R2 ¼ R4
C1 is the compensation capacitor to ensure stable operation. If the available control voltage VIn is of
negative polarity, the circuit is then wired as an inverting ampliﬁer by applying VIn to R1 instead; R3 in
that case is grounded.
Another drive circuit with feedback control is shown in Figure 9.10. It is similar to the driver circuit of
Figure 9.9, except for the fact that the laser diode in this case is connected as a ﬂoating load. A low-noise
operational ampliﬁer (opamp) feeds a current booster transistor. Laser diode current is sensed by
measuring the voltage drop across a sense resistor RSense wired in series with the emitter terminal of
bipolar transistor. Again, output current is controlled by the input voltage VIn and can be computed from
Equations 9.3 and 9.4. C1 is the compensation capacitor.
IO  RSense ¼ VIn  R2
R1
(9.3)
IO ¼ VIn  R2
R1  RSense
(9.4)
The voltage-controlled constant-current sources discussed so far provide constant drive to the laser
diode, provided that the DC supply voltage, the voltage at the emitter terminal and the resistance in the
emitter lead are all constant. It would be a reasonably good assumption if the source voltage were derived
from a precision band-gap reference and the resistors used had stability speciﬁcations equal to or better
than the desired level of current stability.
Figure 9.8
Improved basic constant current source.
280
Lasers and Optoelectronics

When it comes to achieving a current stability of 10 ppm or better (equivalent to 1 mA in 100 mA),
desirable in laser-diode-based spectroscopy and other similar applications, a feedback loop that samples
the diode current in situ and applies a correction in the case of drift in drive current becomes essential. A
negative feedback loop of this kind would reduce the drift or error in the drive current by a factor that
equals the loop gain.
One such circuit that achieves feedback-loop-based current regulation is shown in Figure 9.11. The
circuit is self-explanatory. The basic circuit topology is similar to that used in driver circuits described in
Figure 9.10. The only change is the inclusion of a junction ﬁeld effect transistor (JFET) connected in
series with the sense resistor. The JFET is wired here as a voltage-variable resistor. Having set the drive
current at a certain value, any tendency on the part of the drive current to change is compensated by an
appropriate variation in the drain-source resistance of the JFET. For instance, when the current tends to
increase the JFET gate voltage is driven more negatively, increasing the drain-source resistance and
restoring the current back to the set value. Initially, at the nominal value of drive current, circuit
parameters are adjusted in order to ensure that the JFET with the feedback loop closed gets a negative
gate voltage to keep it nearly in the middle of its variable-voltage resistor (VVR) characteristics. This is
done to exploit fully the voltage-dependent resistance range.
Example 9.1
Refer to the laser diode drive circuit of Figure 9.12. Compute the values of R1, R2, R3 and R4 for a

3. Assuming R1 ¼ 100 kV, we get R2 ¼ 2.5 kV
4. R3 ¼ R1 ¼ 100 kV and R4 ¼ R2 ¼ 2.5 kV.
9.4.3
Laser Diode Driver with Modulation Input
An important functional requirement in many application circuits is the option to modulate the laser
output. The laser diode driver circuit of Figure 9.13, a modiﬁcation of the driver circuit of Figure 9.8, can
be used to modulate the laser diode. The circuit is self-explanatory. The DC reference voltage that
determines the unmodulated laser drive current and the modulating signal have been summed up in the
inverting ampliﬁer A1. The polarity is restored in the unity gain inverting buffer A2 following A1.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Solution
1. Laser diode current ¼ (5  VE)/20 A, where VE is the voltage at the Q1 emitter
2. VE is equal to voltage at inverting input of ampliﬁer A3. A1 is a unity gain inverting summer; A2 is a
unity gain inverting ampliﬁer. Voltage at the non-inverting input of A3 is therefore the sum of VIn and
voltage appearing across 10 kV resistor at the input of A1.
3. Voltage across 10 kV resistor ¼ (5  10)/25 V ¼ 2 V
4. Therefore, at the positive peak of VIn, VE ¼ 2 þ 1 V ¼ 3 V
5. At the negative peak of VIn, VE ¼ 2  1 V ¼ 1 V and for VIn ¼ 0 V, VE ¼ 2 V.
6. Therefore, at the positive peak of VIn, laser diode current ¼ (5  3)/20 A ¼ 100 mA
7. At the negative peak of VIn, laser diode current ¼ (5  1)/20 A ¼ 200 mA
8. Laser diode current waveform is shown in Figure 9.15.

9.4.4
Laser Diode Driver with Protection Features
Laser diodes are highly prone to performance deterioration and permanent damage if drive current
exceeds the maximum limit. Sudden spikes in the drive current could also be fatal to the laser diode.
Protection features such as slow start, immunity to fast transients and over-current limit are essential
requirements of every laser diode driver circuit.
Figure 9.12
Example 9.1.
Figure 9.13
Laser diode driver with modulation input.
284
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Figure 9.16 shows a laser diode driver with features of slow start, immunity to fast transients and
current limit. The circuit operates as follows. Laser diode current is determined by the voltage appearing
across non-inverting terminal of opamp A4, resistor R10 and regulated DC supply voltage (þV). The
voltage at the non-inverting terminal of opamp A4 depends upon the sum of voltage appearing across the
R3–R4 junction and the modulation input. Opamps A2 and A3 are wired as unity gain inverting summing
ampliﬁer and unity gain inverting ampliﬁer, respectively. The Schmitt comparator at the input provides a
delay of the order of a few tens of milliseconds after the switch on to offer protection against switch-on
transients. The time delay is determined by the R1C1 time constant. R2 and C2 provide the desired slow or
soft start and decay during switch on and switch off. The R2C2 time constant is of the order of 1–2 s. R11
and C3 provide additional protection against transients; D1 protects the laser diode against reverse
voltages. Opamp A1 along with resistors R12 and R13 and diode D2 provides the over-current limit. During
normal operation, D2 remains reverse-biased and therefore output of opamp A1, which equals the voltage
across the R12–R13 junction, does not interfere with normal operation of the circuit. The laser diode drive

Example 9.2.
Figure 9.15
Answer to Example 9.2.
Laser Diode Electronics
285

current in this case continues to be dictated by the voltage equal to the sum of the modulation input
voltage and the voltage appearing across the R3–R4 junction. The moment the upper current level tends to
exceed the set limit, the diode becomes forward-biased. The voltage at the inverting input of opamp A2,
and hence its output, is clamped at a value equal to the voltage at R12–R13 junction.
Figure 9.17 shows a typical laser diode driver circuit using a feedback loop for current regulation and
having inbuilt protection features. The circuit is self explanatory; various building blocks shown in the
ﬁgure have been described in sections 9.4.2 and 9.4.3.
9.4.5
Laser Diode Driver with Automatic Power Control
An alternative method of driving the laser diode is to vary the drive current using a feedback loop to
maintain a constant output power. The laser diode with an integral photodiode is particularly suitable for
this operational mode; Figure 9.18 shows a typical circuit conﬁguration. The photodiode current is
Figure 9.16
Laser diode driver with protection features.
286
Lasers and Optoelectronics

proportional to optical output power from the laser diode. This photocurrent is converted into a
proportional voltage using a transimpedance ampliﬁer conﬁgured around opamp A4. The voltage
representative of laser power is then summed up with a reference voltage representing the desired
power level in an inverting summer conﬁguration A5. The output of the summer, which is null when the
actual power level equals the desired power level, feeds an integrator A6 that provides the correction
signal even for inﬁnitesimally small deviations from the desired power level. The integrator output
summed up with a bias voltage feeds control element, which is a JFET in this case.
The circuit provides automatic power regulation as follows. A fall in the output power leads to a
reduction in the photodiode current, which further results in a less-negative transimpedance ampliﬁer
output. As a result, the summing ampliﬁer output that feeds the integrator becomes more negative. The
integrator output becomes more positive and the FET gate becomes more negative than the nominal bias
voltage. A more negative gate voltage means a larger drain-source resistance and a reduced gain for the
ampliﬁer A2. Reduced gain means reduced voltage at the emitter terminal and an increased diode drive
current. An increase in drive current increases the output power of the laser diode.
Figure 9.17
Laser diode driver with feedback control and protection features.
Laser Diode Electronics
287


When the output power from the laser tends to increase, photocurrent also tends to increase. An
increase in photocurrent forces the transimpedance ampliﬁer output to be more negative. As a result of
this, the integrator output and hence the gate of JFET become less negative. The drain-source resistance
of JFET decreases, thereby increasing the gain of ampliﬁer A2. An increase in gain of A2 increases
voltage at the non-inverting input of A3, thereby reducing the drive current. This restores power to the
original value. Power is stabilized at a point where the transimpedance ampliﬁer output equals the
voltage set by the power-setting potentiometer.
9.4.6
Quasi-CW Laser Diode Driver
Continuous wave (CW) with/without modulation is the most common mode of operation of laser diodes.
Another possible mode of operation is known as quasi-CW mode of driving laser diodes. In the case of
quasi-CW mode, the laser diode is driven by current pulses that are typically hundreds of microseconds
to a few milliseconds wide as compared to a few tens to a few hundreds of nanoseconds wide in the case
of conventional pulsed mode of operation. These diodes are operated at relatively low repetition rates of
typically a few hertz to a few tens of hertz. The relatively high peak power and efﬁcient operation of
quasi-CW laser diodes have made them an ideal choice for pumping solid-state lasers. Higher peak
powers are possible due to the low duty cycle of operation of quasi-CW devices, which keeps the average
power low. The quasi-CW mode of operation can be a very powerful analytical tool for both pre-package/
post-package testing and characterization of laser diodes. The pulsed mode of operation allows
characterization with minimal thermal effects.
A laser diode driver for quasi-CW operation is conﬁgured around the same basic building blocks as
those described in Sections 9.4.2–9.4.4 in the case of CW operation. Figure 9.19 shows the block
schematic arrangement of a typical quasi-CW laser diode driver.
The circuit operates as follows. The oscillator, which is basically an astable multivibrator circuit,
produces a train of pulses with pulse width and repetition rate at which the laser diode or laser diode array
needs to be driven. A soft start inbuilt into the oscillator provides protection against damage due to
instant power-on. The power stage contains the active device/s and associated circuitry capable of
delivering the required current pulse amplitude. The peak current pulse amplitude typically varies from a
few tens to a few hundreds of amps in the case of a diode array used for optical pumping of solid-state
lasers.
The drive and control block is a preampliﬁer stage with some kind of control feature that allows the
gain of the ampliﬁer and hence the drive current to the power stage to be varied. The drive and control
stage could be conﬁgured either around discrete bipolar transistors/MOSFETs or an opamp with JFETas
Figure 9.19

one of the gain-determining elements. The power stage could be conﬁgured around one or a parallel
connection of more than one bipolar transistors/MOSFETs. The sensing element is usually a resistor
connected in series with the diode or diode array. The peak pulse voltage across the sense resistor
representing the peak amplitude of current pulse is ampliﬁed and then subsequently stretched. The
stretched pulse train after ﬁltering is fed to a differential ampliﬁer stage where it is compared with a
standard reference to produce an error voltage. The error voltage here represents the deviation of the peak
amplitude of current pulse from the desired value. The error voltage is added to a ﬁxed bias and fed to the
control element in the drive stage to control the drive current to the power stage.
Figure 9.20 shows a detailed circuit diagram of a typical laser diode drive circuit for quasi-CW mode
of operation; note that this circuit is also used to illustrate the building blocks of Figure 9.19 (other
variations are also possible). In the circuit diagram of Figure 9.20, U1 is a 555 timer wired as an astable
rising-edge multivibrator to generate a train of rectangular pulses of desired pulse width and repetition
rate. The R1–C1 combination constitutes a soft-start circuit. The soft-start circuit time constant is such
that it takes about 3–4 current pulses before it attains nominal amplitude at the output of the timer IC.
Bipolar transistors Q6–Q9 constitute the output stage. The number of bipolar transistors to be connected
in parallel depends upon the desired peak current through the laser diode. Power MOSFETs can also be
used in place of bipolar transistors. Resistors R11–R14 are current-equalizing resistors and facilitate equal
current sharing by the four transistors. The current-equalization resistors are not needed if power
MOSFETs were used for the purpose, as they are voltage-controlled devices. In the circuit shown,
transistors Q1, Q2 and Q3 provide the base drive to the output stage. The higher the required value of peak
laser diode current, the higher the required magnitude of base drive current. Again, a relatively simpler
drive circuit would be required in the case of a power-MOSFET-based output stage.
R30 is the current sense resistor and is of the order of a few tens of milliohms. The voltage pulse across
the sense resistor is ampliﬁed in U5, which is then stretched in a two-stage pulse stretcher conﬁgured
around U3 and U4. The stretching provided by U3 and U4 depends upon the R31–C12 and R29–C15 time
constants, respectively. The notch ﬁlter conﬁgured around U2 at the output of the pulse-stretching stage is
tuned to the repetition rate of current pulses. The notch ﬁlter is followed by a low-pass ﬁlter conﬁgured
around U6. While the notch ﬁlter removes the repetition frequency component, a low-pass ﬁlter removes
other high-frequency components arising out of sharp rising edges of current pulses. The output of a low-
pass ﬁlter is a DC voltage representative of the peak value of drive current. After suitable conditioning in
the non-inverting ampliﬁer conﬁgured around U6, this DC voltage is compared with a stable reference
provided by a band-gap reference in a comparator circuit conﬁgured around U7. The error voltage
produced at the output of comparator circuit is added to a ﬁxed-DC bias voltage in the adder circuit
conﬁgured around U8. This constitutes the control voltage that is used to control the base drive current for
the output stage. In the circuit shown, transistors Q4 and Q5 constitute a variable-voltage resistance
whose resistance value is dictated by the control voltage.
9.5
Laser Diode Temperature Control
The importance of temperature control in the operation of a laser diode has been highlighted in Section
9.2.1. Important characteristic parameters of a laser diode such as threshold current, slope efﬁciency,
wavelength and lifetime are critically dependent on the operating temperature. Lower operating
temperature leads to enhanced lifetime. Awell-known technique to remove heat from the diode junction
is to use an appropriate heat sink. The difference between the junction temperature and the ambient
temperature depends on the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance and the power dissipated in the
junction. Junction-to-ambient thermal resistance in turn depends on junction-to-case thermal resistance
and case-to-ambient thermal resistance. Thermal resistance is measured in C W1. Junction-to-case
thermal resistance depends on the device package. The heat sink reduces the case-to-ambient thermal
resistance and therefore the overall junction-to-ambient thermal resistance. The junction-to-ambient
thermal resistance can be computed from Equation 9.6:
1=uJA ¼ 1=uJC þ 1=uCA
(9.6)
Laser Diode Electronics
291

where uJ–A is the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance; uJ–C is the junction-to-case thermal resistance;
and uC–A is the case-to-ambient thermal resistance.
The passive technique of heat removal using a heat sink becomes impractical for moderate and large-
power diode lasers. The other limitation is that it cannot be used to operate the laser diode at a
temperature lower than the ambient temperature, nor can it be used to stabilize the temperature. Use of an
active temperature stabilization mechanism therefore becomes essential when working with moderate
and high-power laser diodes and also in low-power laser diodes where the application demands precise
temperature control. A thermoelectric cooling device based on the Peltier effect is the heart of such a
system.
9.5.1
Thermoelectric Cooling Fundamentals
A common technique of active temperature stabilization of laser diodes makes use of a thermoelectric
(TE) cooler as the control element, a temperature sensor and a properly designed feedback loop. The TE
cooler is a reversible solid-state heat pump whose operation is based on the Peltier effect. According to
the Peltier effect, when an electric current is passed through a junction of dissimilar metals heat is created
or absorbed at the junction depending upon the direction of ﬂow of current. The heat transfer according
to the Peltier effect takes place in the direction of ﬂow of charge carriers. For example, if we took an
N-type semiconductor and connected it across a source of DC voltage, electrons (that are the charge
carriers in this case) will ﬂow from the contact connected to the negative terminal of the voltage source to
the contact connected to the positive terminal of the voltage source. As a result, the negative terminal
becomes cold due to absorption of heat and the positive terminal becomes hot due to the release of heat.
In the case of a P-type semiconductor, the opposite occurs with the negative terminal becoming hot and
the positive terminal becoming cold. Neither N-type or P-type pellets make practical thermoelectric
devices. If we arranged N-type and P-type pellets in the form of a couple by connecting them electrically
in series and thermally in parallel as shown in Figure 9.21, heat would be transferred in the same
direction as shown in Figure 9.21. A cascaded arrangement of such couples as shown in Figure 9.22 can
be used to increase the cooling/heating capacity of the device.
A practical TE module is usually a two-dimensional array of P-N couples connected electrically in
series and sandwiched between two thermally conducting and electrically insulating faces as shown in
Figure 9.23. Both single-stage and multiple-stage TE cooler modules are commercially available.

Multiple-stage modules offer higher cooling/heating capacity and maximum differential temperature
speciﬁcations. Figure 9.24 depicts single-stage and multistage TE cooler modules.
ATE module literally pumps heat from one place to another, heating one face and cooling the other in
the process. Whether a particular face becomes hot or cold depends upon the direction of current ﬂow
through the TE module. By controlling the magnitude and direction of the current drive to the TE
module, it can therefore be used as a control element in a temperature-stabilization circuit. The TE
module pumps the heat dissipated in the laser diode onto a heat sink mounted on the supposedly hot face
of the TE module. The heat is transferred from the heat sink to the ambient.

Thermoelectric Cooler: Performance Characteristics
TE modules are characterized by maximal performance parameters, which include:
1. maximum temperature difference DTmax along the module at no heat load
2. cooling/heating capacity Qmax corresponding to zero temperature difference
3. device current Imax measured at DTmax
4. terminal voltage Vmax corresponding to Imax with no heat load
5. coefﬁcient of performance (COP)
6. AC resistance.
DTmax is the maximum possible differential temperature across the TE module for a given value of
temperature at the hot side of the module. Maximum differential temperature always occurs when the
heat load is zero.
Qmax is the maximum heat load for DT ¼ 0. Note that Qmax is not the maximum amount of heat the
device can handle. If the heat load exceeds Qmax, the device still pumps heat with the difference that DT
becomes negative. This implies that the cold side is now the hot side. The heat load the device can pump
for a given value of DT decreases with increasing DT.
Imax is the DC current that will produce maximum possible DT (DTmax) across the TE module for a
given value of hot side temperature. Imax is not the maximum current the device can withstand before it
fails; if the drive current is less than Imax, it will be insufﬁcient to produce the highest possible DT. If it is
more than Imax, the power dissipated in the Peltier device will increase. This increases the temperature of
the hot side and reduces the attainable DT.
Vmax is the DC voltage that would deliver the maximum possible DT (DTmax) across the module.
Again, it is not the maximum voltage that the device can withstand before failing. For terminal voltage
greater than Vmax, the power dissipated in the Peltier device goes up, increasing the hot side temperature,
which reduces DT. If it is lower than Vmax, there would be insufﬁcient current to achieve maximum DT.
Coefﬁcient of performance (COP) is deﬁned as the ratio of pumped heat load to electrical power
supplied to the device. Electrical power input to the TE module is the product of drive current and
terminal voltage. COP is representative of a thermoelectric cooling/heating system.
AC resistance is the internal resistance of the TE module. It may be mentioned here that the parameter
is dependent on the type of applied voltage. It refers to the fact that an AC voltage must be applied to the
device to measure its resistance. If a DC voltage were applied, the resulting differential temperature
developing across the device would give rise to a Seebeck voltage, which would oppose the applied DC
voltage and make the device appear to be more resistive than it actually is. It may be mentioned here that
special test equipment is used to measure this parameter.
Various performance parameters are interdependent. This interdependence is best understood with the
help of performance curves, which are invariably given in the device data sheet provided by the
manufacturer. The true analysis of a TE module operation can only be performed with the help of these
performance curves. Figure 9.25a–d depicts performance curves of a typical TE module.
Refer to Figure 9.25a, which shows the variation of heat load pumping capability QC as a function of
DT for different values of Imax. Two important inferences are evident from the family of curves: (1) heat
load pumping capability is inversely proportional to DT for a given value of Imax; and (2) as Imax
decreases, both heat load pumping capability for a given DT and attainable DT for a given heat load
pumping capability decrease. The manufacturer’s data sheet usually gives performance curves for two
different hot side temperatures.
Figure 9.25b shows the family of curves depicting the relationship between terminal voltage V and
differential temperature DT for different values of Imax. Again, two important inferences can be made: (1)
terminal voltage is more or less independent of DT; and (2) for a given value of DT, terminal voltage V
varies directly with Imax.
Figure 9.25c depicts the family of curves describing dependence of heat load QC on terminal voltage
for different values of differential temperature DT. The following important conclusion can be drawn
Laser Diode Electronics
295

from these curves: for a given value of DT, heat load pumping capability reduces with a decrease in
terminal voltage. In other words, for a given heat load pumping requirement, an increase in terminal
voltage increases the achievable DT.
Figure 9.25d shows the family of curves depicting the dependence of COP on drive current for
different values of DT. Two important inferences can be made: (1) for a given DT, COP peaks at a certain
Figure 9.25
Performance curves of TE module.

value of drive current; the curve rolls off on both sides; and (2) the peak value of COP also reduces with
an increase in DT.
9.5.3
TE Module Selection
Major performance parameters that dictate selection criteria for the TE module for a given application
include operating temperature difference DT between the cold side and the hot side, heat load to be
pumped by the TE module, drive current and terminal voltage. In some cases, there may even be
dimensional restrictions.
Figure 9.25

The heat load to be pumped by the TE module may consist of two types – active or passive – or a
combination of the two. An active load is the heat dissipated by the device being cooled. In the case of a
laser diode, it equals the total input electrical power minus the laser output power. Passive heat loads are
parasitic in nature and may originate from conduction, convection or radiation phenomena.
Conductive heat transfer takes place by the direct impact of molecules moving from a high-
temperature region to a low-temperature region. In most cases of thermoelectric cooling, TE modules
provide the largest conductive path. Conductive heat loading on a system may occur through lead wires
and mounting screws which form a thermal path from the device being cooled to the heat sink or ambient
environment. Conductive loading is described by Equation 9.7:
Qcond ¼ kADT
L
(9.7)
where
Qcond ¼ conductive heat load (W)
k
¼ thermal conductivity of the material (W m1 C1)
A
¼ cross-sectional area of the material (m2)
L
¼ length of the heat path (m)
DT
¼ temperature difference across the heat path (C) equal to difference between hot side and
cold side temperatures.
Convective heat loads on TE modules are generally a result of natural (or free) convection. Naturally
occurring air currents cause heat transfer between the device to be cooled or heated and the ambient.
Convective heat load may become a limiting factor for large temperature differences. The rate at which
convective heat transfer takes place depends upon the geometry of the heat load and surroundings.
Convective heat transfer load can be expressed by Equation 9.8:
Qconv ¼ hADT
(9.8)
where
Qconv ¼ convective heat load
h
¼ convective heat transfer coefﬁcient (W m2 C1)
A
¼ exposed surface area (m2)
DT
¼ temperature difference.
Radiative heat transfer occurs through electromagnetic radiation emitted from one object and
absorbed by the other. Radiation heat loads are usually considered insigniﬁcant when the system is
operated in a gaseous environment, as the other forms of passive heat loads are relatively much stronger.
Radiation loading is usually signiﬁcant in systems with small active loads and large temperature
differences, especially when operating in a vacuum environment. Radiative heat transfer varies with the
fourth power of the temperature difference between the heat load and the surroundings. It is expressed by
Equation 9.9:

¼ area of enclosed body (m2)
T1
¼ absolute temperature of enclosed body (K)
T2
¼ absolute temperature of surroundings (K).
298
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Having computed the heat load Q to be pumped by the TE module, the next obvious step is to compute
the required value of differential temperature DT. Performance curves are used to pick the right TE
module from a range of single-stage and multistage devices available from a host of manufacturers. For
example, a TE module would give DTmax speciﬁcation in the range of 65–70 K for single-stage devices,
90–100 K for two-stage devices, 110–120 K for three-stage devices and 120–130 K for four-stage
device). Also, in both single-stage and multistage TE modules, devices with different heat load capacity
are available to meet the designer’s requirements. Equation 9.10 relates the pumped heat load Q to the
performance parameters of the TE module:

Equation 9.10 or 9.11 may be used to choose the right TE module to meet the required heat load and
differential temperature speciﬁcations, and are valid for single-stage or at the most two-stage TE
modules.
9.5.4
Heat Sink Selection
Selecting the right heat sink from those available or designing one to meet application requirements is
crucial to the overall operation of the thermoelectric system. Differential temperature DT between hot
and cold sides of the TE module is an important speciﬁcation of a thermoelectric cooling/heating system.
The hot and cold side temperatures in turn depend upon the temperature of the surroundings and heat
sink-to-ambient thermal resistance. The thermal resistance determines the temperature difference
between that of the heat sink and the surroundings. The product of thermal resistance (measured in
C W1) and heat dissipated in the heat sink (measured in W) gives this temperature difference. An
inadequate heat sink would cause a larger temperature difference and thus put more stringent demands
on the TE module. A typical design parameter might be to limit the heat sink temperature rise above
ambient in the range of 10–20 C.
Heat power dissipated into the heat sink is equal to the sum of total pumped heat load, comprising
active and passive loads, and the electrical power input to the TE module. The latter is the product of
drive current and terminal voltage. The objective of the heat sink design is to minimize thermal resistance
in order to keep the hot side temperature of the TE module as close to the ambient temperature as
possible. This is achieved through increased exposed surface area and may require forced air or liquid
circulation. The three basic types of heat sinks include natural convective, forced convective and liquid-
cooled types. Typical values of thermal resistance are within the range 0.5–5 C W1 for naturally
convective and 0.02–0.5 C W1 for forced convective heat sinks. Among the three types, liquid-cooled
heat sinks offer the best performance with thermal resistance ranging from 0.005–0.15 C W1. Most
applications involving thermoelectric cooling require forced convective or liquid-cooled heat sinks.
Having computed the required thermal resistance, the next step is to look for a heat sink or heat sink/fan
combination that could deliver the intended performance. It may not always be possible to acquire one
with the desired thermal resistance which ﬁts the dimensional and other constraints; a practical approach
would be to choose the best compromise.
Example 9.3
A typical lead selenide (PbSe) infrared detector with a resistance of 1 MV, operated at a bias voltage of
100 V, is to be thermoelectrically cooled to 23 C from an ambient of 27 C. If the total exposed surface

Example 9.4
A thermoelectric cooling system for a laser diode is designed to handle a temperature difference of 30 C
between the hot and cold sides of the TE module. Total pumped heat load is 10 W and the TE module
chosen for the purpose is driven by 1.5 A at a terminal voltage of 10 V. If the laser diode is cooled to 20 C
and the heat sink on the hot side has a thermal resistance of 0.4 C W1, determine the maximum ambient
temperature for which the system will provide the desired cooling.
Solution
1. Maximum hot side temperature that can be handled by the system ¼ 20 þ 30 ¼ 50 C
2. Now, heat sink temperature ¼ 50 C
3. Heat dissipated in the heat sink ¼ 10 þ 1.5  10 W ¼ 25 W
4. Thermal resistance of heat sink ¼ 0.4 C W1
5. Therefore, temperature difference between heat sink and ambient ¼ 25  0.4 ¼ 10 C
6. Maximum acceptable ambient temperature ¼ 50  10 ¼ 40 C.
Example 9.5
A 10 W laser diode with an electrical to optical conversion efﬁciency of 40% is to be operated at 10 C
against a worst-case ambient of 35 C using a TE-cooler-based temperature controller. Heat load due to
conduction and convection are estimated to be equal to 5 W. Radiation loss is negligible. The
thermoelectric module chosen for the purpose requires electrical input power of 20 W to provide the
desired cooling. If the temperature difference between the heat sink and ambient is not to exceed 5 C,
determine the following:
1. COP of the thermoelectric system
2. maximum allowable thermal resistance of heat sink
3. minimum value of Qmax of TE module if its DTmax rating is 60 C.
Solution
1. COP ¼ pumped heat load/electrical input power to TE module
2. Electrical power input to laser diode ¼ 10/0.4 W ¼ 25 W. Therefore, active heat load of the laser
diode ¼ 25  10 W ¼ 15 W
3. Passive heat load ¼ 5 W

9. Temperature difference between cold and hot sides of TE module, DT ¼ 40  10 ¼ 30 C

Thermoelectric Cooler Drive and Control Circuits
Precise temperature control using thermoelectric modules is accomplished by continuously monitor-
ing the temperature of the device to be cooled or heated with a temperature sensor such as thermistor
and employing an electronic feedback loop to alter the drive current to the TE module in case the
controlled temperature tends to deviate from the speciﬁed value. Figure 9.26 shows the basic block
schematic of a TE module-based temperature control circuit. The key building blocks of the drive and
control circuit include temperature sensor, error ampliﬁer, error signal processor and a bipolar output
drive circuit. A bipolar output driver provides the required power to drive the TE module. The output
stage in most cases is designed to allow ﬂow of drive current in either direction through the TE
module. This enables both cooling and heating of the device to maintain its temperature at the
speciﬁed value regardless of ambient temperature being higher or lower. Like laser diode drive
circuits, leading international manufacturers offer integrated circuits with on-chip TE module drive
and control functions.
9.5.5.1
Temperature Sensing Circuits
The temperature sensor in most cases is a negative temperature coefﬁcient (NTC) thermistor. Other
commonly used temperature sensors include semiconductor devices that employ temperature-
dependent forward-biased junction voltage and resistance temperature detectors (RTD). A thermistor

has the advantage of high sensitivity but suffers from non-linearity of resistance versus temperature
characteristics. Semiconductor devices and RTD sensors are linear but are less sensitive than
thermistor.
When using a thermistor as a temperature sensor, it is connected either in a simple voltage divider or a
balanced bridge circuit as shown in Figure 9.27a and b. In both cases, the temperature-dependent
resistance of the thermistor is compared to a known ﬁxed resistance. The circuit of Figure 9.27a
generates a single-ended temperature-dependent voltage. Resistance R in the voltage divider network is
chosen to be equal to the resistance of the thermistor at the desired stabilized temperature in order to take
full advantage of the available voltage range. If temperature is to be controlled over a speciﬁc range, R is
taken to be equal to the resistance of the thermistor corresponding to the centre of the temperature range.
For example, if the desired temperature range to be controlled is 0 to –40 C, reference temperature
would be 20 C.
The balanced bridge arrangement of Figure 9.27b produces a differential output. Again, R is chosen to
be equal to the resistance of the thermistor at the desired temperature. In this case, output voltage will be
zero when the temperature is equal to the desired value. As the temperature deviates from the desired
value, output voltage swings in a direction depending upon whether temperature is lower or higher than
the desired value. An intrinsic advantage of this circuit is that voltage versus temperature characteristics
is more linear than the resistance versus temperature characteristics of the thermistor.
Another commonly used temperature sensor is the integrated temperature sensor. AD590 from
Analogue Devices is one such sensor. It produces an output current proportional to the absolute
temperature. It has an operational range of 55 C to þ150 C and a current to temperature coefﬁcient of
1.0 mA K1 over the supply voltage range of 4–30 V. Figure 9.28 shows the application circuit along with
transfer characteristics.

Error Ampliﬁer
The error ampliﬁer ampliﬁes the difference between the two voltage signals representing the measured
and the desired temperatures. Figure 9.29 shows a typical error ampliﬁer interfaced with temperature-
sensing and reference-voltage-generating circuits. In the circuit of Figure 9.29, a thermistor is used for
temperature sensing and the output of the temperature-sensing circuit is compared with the set reference
using an error ampliﬁer.
9.5.5.3
Error Signal Processor
An error signal processor could be anything from a simple on-off controller to a proportional controller
or proportional-integral (PI) or even fully digital proportional-integral-differential (PID) controller.
On-off control is the simplest technique for controlling the temperature and is the least preferred. In this
method, power to the TE module is switched from full on to full off, which degrades its life. A
comparator circuit with the two inputs as reference voltage representing desired temperature and the
voltage representing measured temperature makes an on-off controller.
Figure 9.28
AD590 application circuit and transfer characteristics.

In proportional control, the drive signal to the TE module is proportional to the difference between the
actual and desired temperatures. In a proportional controller, there is always a residual error even after
the controller has settled to the ﬁnal state. This error is proportional to the difference between the desired
temperature and the actual temperature and is inversely proportional to the gain of the control loop. A
simple inverting ampliﬁer makes a proportional controller. In Figure 9.30, the inverting ampliﬁer
provides the desired value of the proportional gain. In a digital system, the proportional controller
computes the error from the measured output and a user-deﬁned input to a program. The error signal is
multiplied by a proportionality constant to generate the control signal.
The problem of residual error of a proportional controller can be overcome by the addition of an
integrator in the control loop. The result is a proportional-integral controller. One disadvantage of PI

control is that it would be slow to respond to large residual errors. Figure 9.31 shows one type of
proportional-integral controller. The circuit is nothing but a parallel connection of a proportional
controller and an integral controller.
A proportional-integral-differential controller (PID) overcomes the problem of slow response to
large residual errors encountered in PI controllers. The addition of the derivative term improves the
transient response of the loop. This type of controller is mainly used in applications where large thermal
loads must be controlled rapidly and accurately. Figure 9.32 shows one type of PID controller, which is
basically a parallel connection of proportional, integral and differential controllers.

are designed to operate from a single positive DC voltage supply. TE modules also need to be driven in
bipolar mode to cater for both heating and cooling operations. A commonly used circuit topology to

provide bipolar drive to TE modules while operating from a single DC voltage is the half-bridge circuit
topology depicted by Figure 9.35. The circuit is usually driven at the input by a driver ampliﬁer stage
with a differential output.
The circuit functions as follows. When the differential input to the output stage swings positive
(Vþ > V), transistors Q1 and Q4 conduct while transistors Q2 and Q3 remain in cut-off. Current
ﬂows through the TE module in the direction as shown by the solid arrow. The voltage across
the TE module and the corresponding current ﬂowing through it is proportional to the input drive
voltage. When the differential input drive swings negative, transistors Q2 and Q3 conduct while
transistors Q1 and Q4 remain in cut-off. As a result, current ﬂows through the TE module in
the opposite direction as shown by the dashed arrow. Again, voltage across the module and the
corresponding current are proportional to the input drive voltage. All transistors operate as emitter
followers and, as a consequence of this, the maximum voltage available across the TE module is
limited to the maximum differential voltage swing available at the input minus twice the base-
emitter voltage drop of the transistor. Maximum current through the TE module is also limited to
the maximum drive current supplied by the driver ampliﬁer output multiplied by the DC current
gain hFE of the transistor.
The shortcoming of limited voltage and current drive capability of the half-bridge circuit of Figure
9.35 is overcome by having a cascaded arrangement of two half-bridge stages as shown in Figure 9.36.
When the differential input drive swings positive, transistors Q1, Q4, Q5 and Q8 conduct while
transistors Q2, Q3, Q6 and Q7 are non-conducting. Current ﬂows through the TE module as shown by
the solid arrow. When the differential input drive swings negative, transistors Q2, Q3, Q6 and Q7
conduct and transistors Q1, Q4, Q5 and Q8 go to cut-off. Current ﬂows through the TE module as
shown by the dashed arrow.
This circuit not only has a much higher current drive capability, but it also provides a rail-to-rail
differential drive of nearly V across the TE module when operated from a DC supply of þV. The circuit
of Figure 9.36 also provides current to the TE module while the circuit of Figure 9.35 applies a voltage.
Since the heat pumped by a TE module is proportional to current ﬂowing through it, current mode control
allows better and more uniform control of the TE module than the voltage mode control. The DC transfer
characteristics (IOut versus VIn) of the half-bridge driver circuit of Figures 9.35 and 9.36 will have a
dead zone of 2VBE. The dead zone may be reduced or eliminated by using negative feedback to
control the gain of the driver ampliﬁer, ensuring that the four transistors are not all switched on at the
same time.

Summary
 Laser diode electronics primarily comprises a source of drive current and a temperature controller.
Since the wavelength of a semiconductor diode laser is strongly dependent on drive current and
operating temperature, the stability of drive current and operating temperature dictates the output
wavelength stability.
 Laser diodes are highly susceptible to damage due to excessive drive current, electrostatic discharge
(ESD) and transients. Laser diode damage manifests itself in the form of: reduced output power, shift
in threshold current, increase in beam divergence and/or failure to laser action, thus producing an
LED-like output only.
 A laser diode protection strategy needs to be multi-pronged with focus on laser diode instrumentation,
system set-up, power line conditioning and laser diode handling. Laser diode instrumentation includes
the current source used to drive the laser diode and temperature controller, and the relevant damage
mechanisms are over-current, overheating, current spikes and power line surges.
 Protection features desirable for laser diode current sources include slow-start, current limit, over-
voltage protection and power line transient suppression. Protection needs of the temperature controller
are also very stringent. The laser diode lifetime is inversely proportional to operating temperature. The
lifetime has been observed to improve by an order of magnitude for every 30 C reduction in the laser
diode case temperature. Laser diodes should be operated at as low a temperature as possible.
 Laser diodes are operated in either constant-current mode or constant-output-power mode. In the case of
the former, the drive current to the laser diode is maintained constant irrespective of variations in the
source of power input. The circuit topology is usually conﬁgured around a current-sensing element that
continuously senses the drive current and produces a proportional voltage. This is then compared with a
reference voltage representing the desired value of drive current to generate the error signal. After
suitable conditioning, the error signal is then fed back to restore the drive current to the desired value.
 In the case of constant-power mode of operation, the current source is designed in such a way that it
adjusts the drive current in a feedback mode to maintain a constant output power instead of
maintaining a constant drive current. Laser diode modules with an integral photodiode suit this

operational mode well. Constant-power mode also precludes the possibility of the output power
increasing with a decrease in operating temperature.
 In quasi-CW mode, a laser diode is driven by current pulses that are typically hundreds of
microseconds to a few milliseconds wide (compared to a few tens to a few hundreds of nanoseconds
in the case of conventional pulsed mode of operation). These diodes are operated at relatively low
repetition rates typically of a few hertz to a few tens of hertz. The relatively high peak powers and
efﬁcient operation of quasi-CW laser diodes have made them an ideal choice for pumping solid-
state lasers.
 A common technique of active temperature stabilization of laser diodes makes use of a thermoelectric
(TE) cooler as the control element, a temperature sensor and a properly designed feedback loop. The
TE cooler is a reversible solid-state heat pump whose operation is based on the Peltier effect.
 According to the Peltier effect, when electric current is passed through a junction of dissimilar metals
heat is created or absorbed at the junction depending upon the direction of ﬂow of current. A practical
TE module is usually a two-dimensional array of P-N couples connected electrically in series and
sandwiched between two thermally conducting and electrically insulating faces.
 ATE module literally pumps heat from one place to another, heating one face and cooling the other in
the process. Whether a particular face becomes hot or cold depends upon the direction of current ﬂow
through the TE module. By controlling the magnitude and direction of the current drive to the TE
module, it can be used as a control element in a temperature stabilization circuit. The TE module
pumps the heat dissipated in the laser diode to a heat sink mounted on the supposedly hot face of the
TE module. The heat is transferred from the heat sink to the ambient.
 Heat power dissipated into the heat sink is equal to the sum of total pumped heat load (comprising
active and passive loads) and the electrical power input to the TE module. The electrical power input to
the TE module is a product of drive current and terminal voltage. The objective of the heat sink design
is to minimize thermal resistance in order to keep the hot side temperature of the TE module as close to
the ambient temperature as possible.
 Key building blocks of the drive and control circuit for thermoelectric cooling include temperature
sensor, error ampliﬁer, error signal processor and a bipolar output drive circuit. The bipolar output
driver provides the required power to drive the TE module. The output stage in most cases is designed
to allow ﬂow of drive current in either direction through the TE module. This enables both cooling and
heating of the device to maintain its temperature at the speciﬁed value, regardless of ambient
temperature being higher or lower.
 The temperature sensor in most cases is a negative temperature coefﬁcient (NTC) thermistor. Other
commonly used temperature sensors include semiconductor devices that employ temperature-
dependent forward-biased junction voltage and resistance temperature detectors (RTD).
 The error ampliﬁer ampliﬁes the difference between the two voltage signals representing the measured
and the desired temperatures. The error signal processor could be anything from a simple on-off
controller to a proportional controller or PI or even fully digital PID controller. The output stage
provides the necessary drive power to the TE module.
 In the case of on-off control, power to the TE module is switched from full on to full off. A comparator
circuit with the two inputs as reference voltage (representing desired temperature) and the voltage
representing measured temperature makes a typical on-off controller. In a proportional controller, the
drive signal to the TE module is proportional to the difference between the actual and desired
temperatures. In this case, there is always a residual error even after the controller has settled to the
ﬁnal state. This error is proportional to the difference between the desired temperature and the actual
temperature and is inversely proportional to the gain of the control loop. The problem of residual error
of a proportional controller can be overcome by the addition of an integrator in the control loop. The
result is a PI controller. A PID controller overcomes the problem of slow response to large residual
errors encountered in PI controllers by the addition of a derivative term.
 In most applications, TE modules need to be driven in bipolar mode to cater for both heating and
cooling operations. A commonly used circuit topology to provide bipolar drive to TE modules while
operating from a single DC voltage is the half-bridge circuit topology. The shortcoming of the limited
Laser Diode Electronics

voltage and current drive capability of a half-bridge circuit is overcome by having a cascaded
arrangement of two half-bridge stages.

Introduction
Optoelectronicsisrelatedtothestudyofelectronicdevicesthatemit,detectandcontrollight.Commonlyused
optoelectronic devices include photoemitters, photosensors, displays and optocouplers. While photoemitters
are electrical-to-optical transducers that are used to convert the electrical energy into output light, photo-
sensorsareoptical-to-electricaltransducers used forconvertingthe incidentlightenergy intoelectricaloutput.
Photoconductors, photodiodes, phototransistors, photomultiplier tubes and image intensiﬁers are some
commonly used photosensors. Photosensors have a signiﬁcant role to play in the design and development
of lasers and laser-based systems. Optocouplers are devices that use a short optical transmission path to
transfer signals between elements of a circuit. Optoelectronic devices constitute the heart of a variety of
systems ranging from simple gadgets such as light meters to the most complex of military systems such as
precision-guided munitions, laser rangeﬁnders and target trackers, from instrumentation, measurement and
diagnostic systems to space-based weather forecasting and remote sensing systems, and from ﬁbre-optic and
laser-based communication applications to spectrophotometry and photometry applications.
This chapter discusses in detail the fundamentals and application circuits of different types of
optoelectronic devices. We begin with a classiﬁcation of optoelectronic devices, followed by the
deﬁnition of various radiometric and photometric terms commonly used in the ﬁeld of optoelectronics.
This is followed by a detailed discussion on different types of photosensors in terms of principle of
operation, characteristic parameters and application circuits. The chapter concludes with a brief
description on optocouplers and different types of displays. The text is adequately illustrated with
practical circuits and a large number of solved examples.
10.2
Classiﬁcation of Photosensors
Photosensors are classiﬁed into two major categories: (1) photoelectric sensors and (2) thermal sensors.
10.2.1
Photoelectric Sensors
Photoelectric sensors can be classiﬁed further into two types: (a) devices that depend on the external
photo effect for their operation and (b) devices that make use of some kind of internal photo effect.
Photoelectric devices of types (a) and (b) include:
a. photoemissive sensors
b. photoconductors
c. junction-type photosensors.
Lasers and Optoelectronics: Fundamentals, Devices and Applications, First Edition. Anil K. Maini.
 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published 2013 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Of the three types mentioned above, photoemissive sensors belong to category (a) based on their
external photo effect. The other two types of device (category (b)) use an internal photo effect. Common
photoemissive sensors include non-imaging sensors such as vacuum photocells and photomultiplier
tubes and imaging sensors such as image intensiﬁer tubes. Junction-type photosensors are also classiﬁed
into amplifying and non-amplifying types. The amplifying type of junction photosensors include
phototransistors, photothyristors and photo ﬁeld-effect transistors (FETs). Non-amplifying types of
junction photosensors include photodiodes, solar cells and charge-coupled devices. A charge-coupled
device is also a type of imaging sensor.
10.2.2
Thermal Sensors
Thermal sensors can be classiﬁed as either:
a. thermocouple (or thermopile) sensors
b. bolometric sensors
c. pyroelectric sensors.
Figure 10.1 depicts the classiﬁcation of photosensors. While thermal sensors absorb incident radiation
and operate on the resulting temperature rise, photoelectric sensors on the other hand are based on the
quantum effect. Thermal sensors are relatively sluggish in their response to incident radiation than
photoelectric sensors. Thermal sensors however offer a much wider operational wavelength band than
photoelectric sensors.
10.3
Radiometry and Photometry
Radiometry is the study of properties and characteristics of electromagnetic radiation and the sources
and receivers of electromagnetic radiation. Radiometry covers a wide frequency spectrum, but for the
present chapter we will limit our discussion to frequencies from infrared to ultraviolet.
Photometry is the science that deals with visible light and its perception by human vision. The most
important difference between radiometry and photometry is that in radiometry the measurements are
made with objective electronic instruments and in photometry measurements are made with reference to
the response of the human eye.
In this section, we deﬁne the commonly used radiometric and photometric quantities.
10.3.1
Radiometric and Photometric Flux
Flux is deﬁned as a ﬂow phenomenon or a ﬁeld condition occurring in space. It is a measure of the total power
emitted from a source or incident on a particular surface. Radiometric ﬂux and photometric ﬂux are denoted
fR and fP, respectively. Radiometric ﬂux or luminous ﬂux is measured in watts (W) while photometric ﬂux is
measured in lumens (lm). A lumen is deﬁned as the amount of photometric ﬂux generated by 1/683 W of
radiometric ﬂux at 555 nm where the photopic vision sensitivity of eye is maximum.
Efﬁcacy of a radiation source K (lm W1) is deﬁned as the ratio of photometric ﬂux to the total
radiometric ﬂux from the source. It is given by Equation 10.1:
K ¼ fP
fR
(10.1)
10.3.2
Radiometric and Photometric Intensity
The intensity function describes the ﬂux distribution in space. Radiometric intensity IR is deﬁned as
the radiometric ﬂux density per steradian. It is given by Equation 10.2 and is expressed in Watts per
steradian (W sr1).
IR ¼ fR
V
(10.2)
316
Lasers and Optoelectronics

where
fR ¼ radiometric ﬂux (W)
V ¼ solid angle (sr)
Photometric or luminous intensity IP is deﬁned as the ratio of luminous ﬂux density per steradian. It is
given by Equation 10.3:
IP ¼ fP
V
(10.3)
Figure 10.1
Classiﬁcation of photosensors.
Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits
317

where
fP ¼ photometric ﬂux (lm)
V ¼ solid angle (sr)
The unit of photometric ﬂux density is the Candela (Cd), equivalent to luminous ﬂux density of one
lumen per steradian (lm sr1).
10.3.3
Radiant Incidence (Irradiance) and Illuminance
Radiant incidence or irradiance ER deﬁnes the radiometric ﬂux distribution on a surface. It is expressed:
ER ¼ fR
A
(10.4)
where A is the area of ﬂux distribution (m2).
Illuminance EP deﬁnes the photometric ﬂux distribution on a surface and is expressed:
EP ¼ fP
A
(10.5)
Two very commonly used units to deﬁne illuminance are lux and foot-candle. Lux is deﬁned as
the illumination of one lumen of luminous ﬂux evenly distributed over an area of one square
metre. Foot-candle is an old English unit and is deﬁned as an illumination of one lumen of
luminous ﬂux evenly distributed over an area of one square foot. One foot-candle is equivalent to
10.764 lux.
10.3.4
Radiant Sterance (Radiance) and Luminance
Radiant sterance (radiance) is deﬁned as the ratio of radiometric ﬂux per unit solid angle per unit area
(W sr1 m2). Luminance is deﬁned as the ratio of luminous ﬂux per unit solid angle per unit area
(lm sr1 m2).
10.4
Characteristic Parameters
Major characteristic parameters used to characterize the performance of photosensors include:
1. responsivity
2. noise equivalent power (NEP)
3. sensitivity, usually measured as detectivity D or D-star (D)
4. quantum efﬁciency
5. response time
6. noise
7. spectral response.
10.4.1
Responsivity
Responsivity is deﬁned as the ratio of electrical output to radiant light input determined in the linear
region of the response. It is measured in amps per watt (AW1) or V W1 if the photosensor produces a
voltage output rather than a current output. Responsivity is a function of the wavelength of incident
radiation and band-gap energy. Spectral response is a related parameter. It is the curve that shows
variation of responsivity as a function of wavelength. Most photoelectric sensors have a narrow spectral
response whereas most thermal sensors have a wide spectral response. As an example, the spectral
response of silicon, germanium and indium gallium arsenide photodiodes are in the range of
318
Lasers and Optoelectronics

200–1100 nm, 500–1900 nm and 700–1700 nm respectively, whereas the spectral response of thermis-
tors is within the range 0.5–10 mm.
Silicon photodiodes exhibit a response from the ultraviolet through the visible and into the near-
infrared part of the spectrum. With the band-gap energy of silicon being 1.12 eVat room temperature, its
spectral response peaks in the near-infrared region between 800 nm and 950 nm. Peak responsivity
ﬁgures for silicon PIN photodiodes are in the range of 0.4–0.6 AW1 and for avalanche photodiodes in
the range of 40–80 AW1. Thermal sensors have poorer responsivity as compared to photoelectric
sensors. As an example, the responsivity ﬁgure for pyroelectric sensors is in the range of 0.5–5 mAW1.
The shape of the spectral response curve of silicon photosensors, particularly in the blue and UV part
of the spectrum, can be altered by choosing an appropriate manufacturing process. Figure 10.2 shows
typical spectral response curves of a silicon photodiode.
It is evident from the spectral response curves shown in Figure 10.2 that silicon becomes
transparent to radiation of longer than 1100 nm wavelength. On the contrary, wavelengths in the
ultraviolet region are absorbed in the ﬁrst 100 nm thickness of the silicon. Even the most careful
surface preparation leaves some surface damage, which reduces the collection efﬁciency for this
wavelength. Anti-reﬂection coatings may be used to enhance the responsivity to about 25% at the
required wavelength, at the cost of a reduction in efﬁciency at other wavelengths that they reﬂect. The
package window also plays an important role in shaping the spectral response. The standard glass
window absorbs wavelengths shorter than 300 nm. For UV detection, a fused silica or UV transmitting
glass window is used. Various ﬁlter windows are also available to tailor the spectral response to suit
the application. Optical ﬁlters can also be added to change the spectral response. A common example
is the use of a speciﬁc ﬁlter to modify the normal silicon response to approximate the spectral
response of the human eye.

In the case of photodiodes, the responsivity Rn is typically highest in a region with photon energies
slightly greater than the band-gap energy. It declines sharply for photon energies in the region of the band
gap, where the absorption decreases. It can be calculated by using Equation 10.6:
Rv ¼ h  e
h  y
(10.6)
where
h ¼ Planck’s constant (¼ 6.625  1034 J s)
n ¼ frequency of incident radiation (Hz)
h ¼ quantum efﬁciency
e ¼ electron charge (¼1.6  1016 C)
Responsivity increases slightly with applied reverse bias due to improved charge collection efﬁciency at
the photodiode. Responsivity also exhibits dependence on temperature variations, due to the variation in
band-gap energy (band-gap energy varies inversely with change in temperature). Figure 10.3 depicts the
change in responsivity with temperature. As is evident from the family of curves, responsivity is more or
less independent of temperature from 500 nm to 900 nm. For wavelengths less than 500 nm, responsivity
decreases or increases gradually with an increase or decrease in temperature, respectively. For wavelengths
greater than 900 nm, it increases or decreases rapidly with an increase or decrease in temperature,
respectively. This can be explained from the nature of temperature dependence of band-gap energy.
The term responsivity should not be confused with sensitivity; the latter is the lowest detectable light
level, which is typically determined by detection noise. It is also signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the required
detection bandwidth. A photosensor should ideally be operated in a spectral region where its responsivity
is not far below the highest possible value, because this leads to the lowest possible detection noise and
thus to a high signal-to-noise ratio and high sensitivity.

10.4.2
Noise Equivalent Power (NEP)
The noise equivalent power (NEP) is the input power to a sensor which generates an output signal current
equal to the total internal noise current of the device, which implies a signal-to-noise ratio of 1. In other
words, it is the minimum detectable radiation level of the sensor. Obviously, a low NEP is desirable. NEP
depends on the wavelength, since that inﬂuences the responsivity of the sensor. The lowest NEP is
achieved for those wavelengths where the responsivity is the highest:
NEP ¼ IN
Rv
(10.7)
where
IN ¼ total noise current (A)
Rv ¼ responsivity (AW1)
The noise power and thus the noise-equivalent power depend on the assumed detection bandwidth. If
the full-detection bandwidth of the device was used to compute NEP, then the NEP would not allow a fair
comparison of sensors with different bandwidths. It is therefore common practice to assume a bandwidth
of 1 Hz, which is usually far below the detection bandwidth. NEP is usually speciﬁed in units of
W Hz0.5 rather than W. In that case, noise current is speciﬁed as A Hz0.5. Effectively, computation of
NEP is based on power spectral density (PSD) rather than on power. Power is simply the power spectral
density computed over a bandwidth of 1 Hz. Since the photodiode light power to current conversion
depends on wavelength, the NEP is quoted at a particular wavelength. As for responsivity, NEP is non-
linear over the wavelength range.
10.4.3
Detectivity and D-star
Detectivity D of a sensor is the reciprocal of its NEP. A sensor with a higher value of detectivity is more
sensitive than a sensor with a lower detectivity value. Detectivity, as for NEP, depends upon noise
bandwidth and sensor area. To eliminate these factors, a normalized ﬁgure of detectivity referred to as
‘D-star’ or D is used. It is deﬁned as the detectivity normalized to an area of 1 cm2 and a noise bandwidth
of 1 Hz. The value of D can be calculated using Equation 10.8:
D ¼ D
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
ADf
p
(10.8)
where
D ¼ detectivity (W1)
D ¼ normalized detectivity (W1 cm Hz1/2)
A
¼ sensor area (cm2)
Df ¼ bandwidth (Hz)
10.4.4
Quantum Efﬁciency
An ideal photosensor should produce one photoelectron per incident photon of light. This is not true for
practical sensors, however. The ratio of the number of photoelectrons released to the number of photons
of incident light absorbed is referred to as the quantum efﬁciency of the sensor. This is the percentage of
input radiation power converted into photocurrent. In other words, it is the intrinsic efﬁciency of the
sensor. The value of quantum efﬁciency h is computed as the ratio of actual responsivity to the ideal
Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits

responsivity as given by Equation 10.9:
h ¼ RActual
RIdeal
(10.9)
The ideal responsivity is defined
RIdeal ¼ Electron charge
Photon energy ¼ e  l
h  c
(10.10)
where c is the speed of light in vacumm (deﬁned as 3  108 m s1).
Substituting the values of h, c and e into Equation 10.10, we have:
RIdeal ¼ 8:044  105l
where l is wavelength in m. Substituting this deﬁnition for RIdeal into Equation 10.9, and changing units
of wavelength to nm,
h ¼ 1:24  103RActual
l
(10.11)
10.4.5
Response Time
Response time is referred to as rise/fall time in photoelectric sensors and as the time constant parameter
in thermal sensors. Rise and fall times are the time durations required by the output to change from 10%
to 90% and from 90% to 10% of the ﬁnal response, respectively. This determines the highest signal
frequency to which a sensor can respond. Time constant is deﬁned as the time required by the output to
reach 63% of the ﬁnal response from an initial value of zero.
Bandwidth BW (MHz) of photoelectric sensors is related to its rise time, deﬁned:
BW ¼ 0:35
tr
(10.12)
where tr is rise time (ms).
Response time of a photodiode is governed by three parameters:
1. drift time tDrift, which is the charge collection time of the carriers in the depletion region of the
photodiode
2. diffusion time tDiff, which is the charge collection time of the carriers in the undepleted region of the
photodiode.
3. RC time tRC is the time constant of the diode–external circuit combination.
RC time is deﬁned as tRC ¼ 2.2 RC, where R is the sum of the photodiode’s series resistance and the
load resistance and C is the sum of the photodiode’s junction and the stray capacitances. Junction
capacitance is directly proportional to the diffused area of the photodiode and inversely proportional to
the applied reverse bias. As a consequence of this, photodiodes with smaller area and larger applied
reverse bias have a faster rise time. In addition, stray capacitance can be minimized by using short leads
and careful electronic circuit lay-out. The total rise time is given by Equation 10.13:
tr ¼

Lasers and Optoelectronics

In photovoltaic mode of operation where there is no applied reverse bias, drift time can be considered
to be negligible and the rise time is dominated by the diffusion time for diffused areas less than 5 mm2
(smaller diffused areas offer very small junction capacitance) and by the RC time constant for larger
diffused areas for all wavelengths. When operated in photoconductive mode where there is an applied
reverse bias, the dominant factor is the drift time if the photodiode is fully depleted; all three factors are
important if the photodiode is not fully depleted.
10.4.6
Noise
Noise is the most critical factor in designing sensitive radiation detection systems. Noise is generated in
these systems in photosensors, radiation sources and post-detection circuitry. Photosensor noise mainly
comprises:
1. Johnson noise
2. shot noise
3. generation-recombination noise
4. ﬂicker noise.
Johnson noise, also known as Nyquist noise or thermal noise, is caused by the thermal motion of
charged particles in a resistive element. The RMS value of the noise voltage depends on the resistance

Shot noise in a photosensor is caused by the discrete nature of the photoelectrons generated. It is
related to the statistical ﬂuctuation of both dark current and the photocurrent. It depends on the average

Shot noise is the dominant source of noise for photodiodes operating in photoconductive mode.

recombination rates in a photosensor. This type of noise is predominant in photoconductive sensors
operating at infrared wavelengths. The generation-recombination noise can be calculated using Equa-

Flicker noise or 1/f noise occurs in all conductors where the conducting medium is not a metal and
exists in all semiconductor devices that require bias current for their operation. Its amplitude is inversely

10.5
Photoconductors
Photoconductors, also referred to as photoresistors, light-dependent resistors (LDRs) and photocells, are
semiconductor photosensors whose resistance decreases with increasing incident light intensity. They
are bulk semiconductor devices with no P-N junction, and have a structure as shown in Figure 10.4a.
When light is incident on the photoconductor, electrons jump from the valence band to the conduction
band; the resistance of the semiconductor material therefore decreases. The resistance change in a
photoconductor is of the order 106, ranging from a few tens of megaohms under dark conditions to a few
tens or hundreds of ohms under bright light conditions. Other features include wide dynamic response,
324
Lasers and Optoelectronics

spectral coverage from ultraviolet to far-infrared and low cost. However, they are sluggish devices,
having a response time of the order of hundreds of milliseconds.
The resistance–illuminance relation in photoconductors is described by Equation 10.18:
Ra ¼ Rb 
Ea
Eb

a
(10.18)
where Ra and Rb are the resistances at illumination levels Ea and Eb, respectively; Ea and Eb are the
illumination levels in lux or foot candles; and a is the characteristic slope of the resistance–illumination
curve.
The value of a is in the range 0.55–0.9. Figure 10.4b depicts the circuit symbol of a photoconductor,
which can be provided in various shapes and sizes. Figure 10.4c shows the typical resistance–
illumination curve of a photoconductor. Commonly used materials in photoconductors are cadmium

sulphide (CdS), lead sulphide (PbS), lead selenide (PbSe), mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe) and
germanium copper (GeCu). The spectral response of some of these photoconductor materials is shown in
Figure 10.4d. Inexpensive CdS photoconductors are used in many consumer items such as camera light
meters, clock radios, security alarms and street lights. On the other hand, GeCu cells are used for infrared
astronomy and infrared spectroscopy applications.
Photoconductors are further classiﬁed as intrinsic or extrinsic photoconductors depending upon
whether an external dopant has been added or not to the semiconductor material. Intrinsic photo-
conductors operate at shorter wavelengths, as the electrons have to jump from the valence to the
conduction band. Extrinsic photoconductors have a spectral response covering longer wavelengths.
10.5.1
Application Circuits
Photoconductors are usually used for detection of infrared radiation. When a bias is applied to the
photoconductor in the absence of radiation, a current referred to as the dark current is generated. When
light is incident on the photoconductor, its resistance decreases and the current ﬂowing through it
increases. Photosignal is the increase in the current caused by radiation. Generally this photosignal is
much smaller (of the order of few parts per thousand) than the dark current. Extracting this small signal
from the dark current is the primary task of the front-end circuit.
Figure 10.5a and b depict some simple circuits using photoconductors. Using photoconductors in
these conﬁgurations however reduces the responsivity of the conductor as the relative change in the
circuit resistance is smaller because of the load resistance R. The choice of R and Rsen also affects the
output voltage from the circuit. For Figure 10.5a, the higher the value of R, the higher the output voltage
but the relative responsivity is poorer. Similarly, in the case of circuit of Figure 10.5b, the higher the value
of R, the lower the output voltage but the relative responsivity is better.
Figure 10.4
(Continued )
326
Lasers and Optoelectronics

To overcome these problems, photoconductors are used in conjunction with ampliﬁers to obtain both
better responsivity and a high output voltage. There are two possible circuit conﬁgurations: voltage-
mode ampliﬁers and current-mode or transimpedance ampliﬁers. The basic transimpedance ampliﬁer is
shown in Figure 10.5c. The non-inverting input of the operational ampliﬁer (opamp) is connected to
ground through resistance Rcom to minimize the DC offset voltage.
The output voltage VO is given by Equation 10.19:
VO ¼  Rf=Rsen
ð
Þ  Vbias
(10.19)
The gain of the transimpedance ampliﬁer should be set such that the ampliﬁer does not saturate at the
maximum expected radiation intensity. Also, if the bias voltage of the photoconductor is more than the
maximum rated input voltage of the opamp, then a Zener diode should be connected between
the inverting input of opamp and the ground terminal. Theoretically, the signal voltage can be obtained
by subtracting the output voltage under dark conditions from the voltage signal in Equation 10.19, given
by Equation 10.20:
VO ¼  Rf=Rsen
ð
Þ  Rf=Rdark
ð

  Vbias
(10.20)
where Rdark is the resistance value of the photoconductor in the absence of radiation.
Practically however, this is not a feasible solution as the dark resistance of the photoconductor is a
strong function of temperature and even a slight increase in temperature decreases the value of dark
resistance by a large amount and vice versa. The sensor temperature therefore has to be controlled to the

using opamp in the transimpedance mode.

order of 0.01 C or better, which is often not feasible. The most common method used to extract the
signal is to modulate the incident radiation at a speciﬁc frequency, either by placing a mechanical
chopper in front of the sensor or by electrically modulating the radiation source. The signal generated
due to radiation is now an AC signal while the dark current is a DC signal. The AC signal can be
separated from the DC background signal using an AC coupled ampliﬁer. A voltage-mode ampliﬁer
using AC coupling is shown in Figure 10.6.
Example 10.3

ﬂowing through the Zener diode can be taken as 10 mA.

expression R ¼ (VCC  VZ)/IZ ¼ (102.5)/(10  103) ¼ 750 kV.
10.6
Photodiodes
Photodiodes are junction-type semiconductor light sensors that generate current or voltage when the P-N
junction in the semiconductor is illuminated by light of sufﬁcient energy. The spectral response of the
photodiode is a function of the band-gap energy of the material used in its construction. The upper cut-off
wavelength lc (nm) of a photodiode is given by Equation 10.21:
lc ¼ 1240
Eg
(10.21)
where Eg is band-gap energy (eV).
Photodiodes are mostly constructed using silicon, germanium, indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs),
lead sulphide (PbS) and mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe). Figure 10.8 shows the spectral
characteristics of these photodiodes.

10.6.1
Types of Photodiodes
Depending upon their construction there are several types of photodiodes. These include PN photo-
diodes, PIN photodiodes, Schottky photodiodes and avalanche photodiodes (APDs).
10.6.1.1
PN Photodiodes
A PN photodiode comprises a PN junction as shown in Figure 10.9a. When light with sufﬁcient energy
strikes the photodiode the electrons are pulled up into the conduction band, leaving behind holes in the
valence band. These electron-hole pairs occur throughout the P-layer, depletion layer and N-layer
materials. When the photodiode is reverse biased, the photo-induced electrons will move down the
potential hill from the P-side to the N-side. Similarly, the photo-induced holes will add to the current ﬂow
by moving across the junction to the P-side. Shorter wavelengths are absorbed at the surface while the
longer wavelengths penetrate deep into the diode.
Figure 10.9b shows the mechanism of conversion of incident light photons into electric current in a PN
photodiode. PN photodiodes are used for precision photometry applications such as medical instrumen-
tation, analytical instruments, semiconductor tools and industrial measurement systems.

330
Lasers and Optoelectronics

10.6.1.2
PIN Photodiodes
In PIN photodiodes, an extra high-resistance intrinsic layer is added between the P- and the N-layers as
shown in Figure 10.10. This has the effect of reducing the transit or diffusion time of the photo-induced
electron-hole pairs, which in turn results in improved response time. PIN photodiodes feature low
capacitance thereby offering high bandwidth, making them suitable for high-speed photometry as well as
optical communication applications.
10.6.1.3
Schottky Photodiodes
A thin gold coating is sputtered onto the N-material to form a Schottky-effect P-N junction. Schottky
photodiodes have enhanced UV response.
10.6.1.4
Avalanche Photodiodes
Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are high-speed high-sensitivity photodiodes utilizing an internal gain
mechanism that functions by applying a relatively higher reverse-bias voltage than that applied in the
case of PIN photodiodes.
Figure 10.11 shows the cross-section of an avalanche photodiode. Avalanche photodiodes are
constructed in order to provide a very uniform junction that exhibits the avalanche effect at reverse-
bias voltages between 30 Vand 200 V. The electron-hole pairs that are generated by incident photons are
accelerated by the high electric ﬁeld to force the new electrons to move from the valence band to the
conduction band. In this way, multiplication of the order 50–100 is achieved. Avalanche photodiodes
have fast response times, similar to that of PIN photodiodes. Responsivity ﬁgures for silicon PIN
photodiodes are in the range 0.4–0.6 AW1 whereas for APDs they are 40–80 AW1, around 100 times
greater than that of PIN photodiodes.
Moreover, APDs offer excellent signal-to-noise ratio of the order of that of photomultiplier tubes.
They are therefore used in a variety of applications requiring high sensitivity such as long-distance
optical communication and optical distance measurement.
10.6.2
Equivalent Circuit
A photodiode is electrically represented by a current source in parallel with an ideal diode. Figure 10.12
shows the equivalent circuit of a photodiode. The current source represents the photocurrent generated
by incident radiation and the diode represents the PN junction. The current source is also shunted by a
junction capacitance Cj and a shunt resistance RSH across it. The parallel arrangement of four elements
is then connected in series with a series resistance RS.
Figure 10.10
PIN photodiode.
Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits
331

Shunt resistance is the slope of the current–voltage characteristic curve of the photodiode at the
origin, where the applied bias voltage is zero. The value of RSH in the case of an ideal photodiode
is inﬁnity. In the case of practical devices however, values range from tens to thousands of
megaohms. A higher shunt resistance is always desirable. Shunt resistance is used to determine the
noise current in the photodiode in the photovoltaic mode of operation where the applied bias
voltage is zero.
Junction capacitance is formed by the boundaries of the depletion region acting as the plates of a
parallel-plate capacitor and the depletion region acting as the dielectric medium. Consequently, it is
directly proportional to the diffused area and inversely proportional to the width of the depletion region.
Higher-resistivity substrates also offer lower junction capacitance. The value of junction capacitance Cj
depends upon the applied reverse bias according to Equation 10.22:

Series resistance in the case of an ideal photodiode is zero. In the case of practical devices, values
range from 10 to 1000 ohms. It is used to determine the linearity of the photodiode response in
photovoltaic mode of operation.
10.6.3
I–V Characteristics
Figure 10.14a and b show the circuitsymboland I–V characteristicsofa photodiode.Aswecan seefromthe
I–V characteristics of a photodiode, the curve in the dark state is similar to that of a conventional rectiﬁer
diode. When light strikes however, the curve shifts downwards with increasing intensity of light. If the
photodiode terminals are shorted, a photocurrent proportional to the light intensity will ﬂow in a direction
from anode to cathode. If the circuit is open, then an open-circuit voltagewill be generated with the positive
polarity at the anode. It may be mentioned here that the short-circuit current is linearly proportional to light
intensity while the open-circuit voltage has a logarithmic relationship with the light intensity.
Photodiodes can be operated in two modes: photovoltaic mode and photoconductive mode. No bias
voltage is applied in the former mode of operation and, due to the incident light, a forward voltage is
produced across the photodiode. In photoconductive operational mode, a reverse-bias voltage is applied
Figure 10.13

Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits
333

across the photodiode. This widens the depletion region, resulting in a higher speed of response. As a
rule-of-thumb, all applications requiring bandwidth less than 10 kHz can use photodiodes in photovoltaic
mode. For all other applications, photodiodes are operated in photoconductive mode. Moreover, the
linearity of a photodiode is also improved when it is operated in the photoconductive mode.
However, there is an increase in the noise current of the photodiode when it is operated in the
photoconductive mode. This is due to the reverse saturation current referred to as the dark current
ﬂowing through the photodiode. The value of dark current is typically in the range 1–10 nA at a
speciﬁed reverse-bias voltage. When the photodiode is operated in the photovoltaic mode, the value
of dark current is zero.
10.6.4
Application Circuits
As discussed above, photodiodes can be operated in two modes (photovoltaic and photoconductive). In the
photovoltaicmode,thephotodiodeisoperatedwithzero external-biasvoltageandisgenerallyusedforlow-
speed applications or for detecting low light levels. Figure 10.15a and b show two commonly used
application circuits employing photodiodes in the photovoltaic mode. The output voltages for these circuits
are given by Idet R and Idet  Rf, respectively, where Idet is the current through the photodiode. The circuit
in Figure 10.15b offers better linearity than the circuit in Figure 10.13a as the equivalent input resistance
across the photodiode in this case is Rf/A, where A is the open-loop gain of the operational ampliﬁer. It is
obvious that the value of Rf/A is much smaller as compared to that of R in the case of Figure 10.15a.
Figure 10.16 shows the load line analysis of a photodiode operating in the photovoltaic mode. The load
line corresponding to the smaller load is closer to the current axis and the load line corresponding to a
larger load is close to the voltage axis. As is evident from the ﬁgure, for a better linear response the
equivalent resistance across the photodiode should be as small as possible.

Figure 10.17a–d show four possible circuits using photodiodes in the photoconductive mode.
In Figure 10.17b, the operational ampliﬁer is used as a voltage follower whereas in Figure 10.17c
and d, the operational ampliﬁer is used in the transimpedance mode. For the circuit in Figure 10.17b,
the output voltage and the effective resistance across the photodiode are Idet  R and R, respectively. Idet
is the current ﬂowing through the photodiode. The output voltage and effective resistance across the
photodiode in Figure 10.17c and d are Idet  Rf and Rf/A. The response of the photodiode for different
loads operating in the photoconductive mode is shown in Figure 10.18. As we can see, circuits with
lower-resistance load line offer better linearity.
Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are also connected in a similar manner as discussed above, except that
a much higher reverse-bias voltage is required for its operation. The power consumption of APDs during
operation is much higher than that of PIN photodiodes and is given by the product of input signal,
sensitivity and reverse-bias voltage. A protective resistor is therefore added to the bias circuit as shown in
Figure 10.19, or a current-limiting circuit is used.
Since the gain of APDs changes with temperature, if they are operated over a wide temperature range a
temperature-offset circuit has to be added; this changes the reverse-bias voltage with temperature in order to
compensate for the change in gain with temperature. As an alternative, a temperature controller can be added
to keep the temperature of APD constant. For detecting low signal levels, shot noise from the background
light should be limited by using optical ﬁlters, source modulation and restricting the ﬁeld-of-view.
10.6.5
Solar Cells
The operation of solar cells is very similar to that of a photodiode in the photovoltaic mode. Due to the
photovoltaic effect, an open-circuit voltage is generated across a P-N junction when it is exposed to light,
which is solar radiation in case of a solar cell. This open-circuit voltage leads to the ﬂow of electric
current through a load resistance connected across it, as shown in Figure 10.20.
As is evident from the ﬁgure, the impinging photon energy leads to the generation of electron-hole
pairs. The electron-hole pairs either recombine and vanish or start drifting in opposite directions, with
Figure 10.17
Application circuits of photodiodes operating in photoconductive mode.

electrons moving towards the N-region and holes moving towards the P-region. This accumulation of
positive and negative charge carriers constitutes the open-circuit voltage. This voltage can cause a
current to ﬂow through an external load or, when the junction is shorted, the result is a short-circuit
current whose magnitude is proportional to input light intensity.
The voltage output and the current-delivering capability of an individual solar cell are very small when con-
sidered as possible electrical power input to any system. As an example, a typical solar cell would produce

500mVoutput with a load current capability of about 150 mA. Solar cells are therefore arranged in series-
parallel to obtain the desired output voltage with required power delivery capability. The series combination is
used to enhance the output voltage while the parallel combination is used to enhance the current rating.
Figure 10.21 shows the current–voltage and power–voltage characteristics of a solar cell. As is evident
from the ﬁgure, a solar cell generates its maximum power at a certain voltage. The power–voltage curve
has a point of maximum power called maximum power point (MPP). The cell voltage and the

corresponding current are less than the open circuit voltage VOC and the short-circuit current ISC,
respectively, at the maximum power point.
Solar cell efﬁciency is the ratio of maximum electrical solar cell power to the radiant light power on
the solar cell area. The efﬁciency ﬁgure for some crystalline solar cells is in excess of 20%. The most
commonly used semiconductor material for making solar cells is silicon. Both crystalline and amorphous
forms of silicon are used for the purpose. Another promising material for making solar cells is gallium
arsenide (GaAs). When perfected, GaAs solar cells will be lightweight and more efﬁcient.

Phototransistors
Figure 10.23 depicts the construction of a phototransistor. Phototransistors are usually connected in a
common emitter conﬁguration with base open and the radiation is concentrated on the region near the
collector-base junction. Figure 10.24a shows the circuit symbol of the phototransistor and Figure 10.24b
shows the typical I–V characteristics of a phototransistor. When there is no radiation incident on the

phototransistor, the collector current IC is due to the thermally generated carriers and is given by
Equation 10.24:
IC ¼ ðb þ 1ÞICO
(10.24)
where ICO is the reverse saturation current and b is the transistor current gain in the common emitter
conﬁguration.
In phototransistors, this current is referred to as the dark current. When light is incident on the
phototransistor, photocurrent is generated and the magnitude of the collector current increases. The
expression for the collector current IC is given by Equation 10.25:
IC ¼ ðb þ 1ÞðICO þ IlÞ
(10.25)
where Il is the current generated due to incident light photons.
10.7.1
Application Circuits
Phototransistors can be used in two conﬁgurations: the common emitter conﬁguration (Figure 10.25a)
and the common collector conﬁguration (Figure 10.25b). In the common emitter conﬁguration, the
output is high and goes low when light is incident on the phototransistor. In common collector
conﬁguration, the output goes from low to high when light is incident on the phototransistor. The
transistor in both the conﬁgurations can act in two modes: active mode and switched mode. In active
mode, the transistor operates in the active region of its characteristics and the output is proportional to
input light intensity. In switched mode, the phototransistor is switched between cut-off and saturation
and output is in the high and low states, respectively. The modes are controlled by the value of the resistor
R. The output of the phototransistor can be ampliﬁed using an opamp or a transistor-based ampliﬁer
circuit.
Example 10.6
Determine the output voltage of the phototransistor circuit shown in Figure 10.26a when a CW light
radiation of 0.1 mW is incident on the active area of the phototransistor. The active area of the transistor
is 10 mm2 and its output characteristics are shown in Figure 10.26b. The base-emitter voltage of the
transistor Q2 ¼ 0.7 V, values of resistors R1, RC and RE are 1 kV, 2.2 kV and 1 kV, respectively, and the
supply voltage VCC is 12 V.

Photo- FET, SCR and TRIAC
In this section we shall discuss the three other important photosensors, namely photo-FETs, photo-SCRs
and photo-TRIACs. While photo-SCRs and photo-TRIACs are latching types of photosensors, photo-
FETs are non-latching photosensors, such as photodiodes and phototransistors.
10.8.1
Photo-FET
Photo-FETs are light-sensitive FET devices where the diode formed by the reverse-biased gate-channel
junction acts as a photodiode. Incident light generates additional photocarriers, resulting in increased
conductivity level. Gate current ﬂows if the gate is connected to an external resistor. Figure 10.27a shows
the circuit symbol of a photo-FET. When no light is incident on the photo-FET, the gate impedance
is very high. When light is incident on the photo-FET, the value of gate impedance decreases.
Figure 10.27b shows the typical application circuit using a photo-FET. When no light is incident, the
gate voltage is approximately equal to the voltage –VGG. When light is incident the negative gate voltage
decreases, resulting in an increase in the value of drain current ID and a decrease in the output voltage VO.
10.8.2
Photo-SCR
Photo-SCRs, generally referred to as light-activated SCRs (LASCRs), are essentially the same as
conventional SCRs except that they are triggered by light incident on the gate junction area. They
comprise a window and lens to focus more light on the gate junction area, more speciﬁcally on the middle
junction J2 of the SCR. They conduct current in one direction when activated by sufﬁcient light, and
continue to conduct until the current falls below a speciﬁed value. In other words, photo-SCRs act as a
latch that can be triggered on by the light incident on the gate junction but they do not turn off when the
light source is removed. They can be turned off by reducing the current below its threshold value.
Photo-SCRs can handle large amounts of current as compared to a photodiode or a phototransistor.
They have a high rate of change of voltage with time, that is, high dV/dt rating, which is important for
triggering the SCR on application of light input. Photo-SCRs are most sensitive to light when their gate
terminal is open. They are generally used in the receiving channel of optocouplers.

application circuit using photo FET.
Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits
343

Figure 10.28a shows the circuit symbol of a photo-SCR and Figure 10.28b shows a simple application
circuit built around it. When no light is incident on the photo-SCR, it is off and no current ﬂows through
the load resistor RL. When the photo-SCR is illuminated, it turns on and hence allows current to ﬂow
through load resistance RL.
10.8.3
Photo-TRIAC
Photo-TRIACs, also referred to as light-activated TRIACs, are bidirectional thyristors that are designed to
conduct current in both directions when the incident light radiation exceeds a speciﬁed threshold value.
Photo-TRIACs are generally used as solid-state AC switches and as photosensors in optocouplers to provide
isolation from the driving source to the load. Figure 10.29 shows the circuit symbol of a photo-TRIAC. The
operation of a photo-TRIAC is similar to a standard TRIAC, except that the trigger current is generated
indirectly for a photo-TRIAC by the light incident on it and is supplied directly to a standard TRIAC. One of
the most important parameters for describing the performance of a photo-TRIAC is the output dV/dt rating.
Other important parameters are the breakdown voltage and the power rating of the device.
There are two different types of photo-TRIACs available: non-zero-crossing and zero-crossing. Non-zero-
crossing photo-TRIACs are used for applications that require ﬁne control involving small time constants.
Zero-crossing photo-TRIACs are used in applications where the control time constant is fairly large.

determine the output voltage when a bright light is ﬂashed on the circuit.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Solution
1. When the circuit is kept in the dark room with no incident light, the photo-SCR is in the non-
conducting state. Therefore, the output voltage VO is equal to the supply voltage, that is, VO ¼ þ24 V.
2. When a bright light is incident on the photo-SCR, it goes into the conducting state and ideally the
output voltage is zero, that is, VO ¼ 0 V.
10.9
Photoemissive Sensors
The photosensors discussed so far are based on the internal photoeffect where the photoelectrons
generated by the incident radiation remain within the semiconductor material. The other category of
photosensors relies on the external photoeffect, where the photo-generated electrons travel beyond the
physical boundaries of the material. These sensors are also referred to as photoemissive sensors. In this
section we discuss some of the commonly used photoemissive photosensors such as vacuum photo-
diodes, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and image-intensiﬁer tubes.
10.9.1
Vacuum Photodiodes
The vacuum photodiode is the oldest photosensor. It comprises an anode and a cathode placed in a
vacuum envelope. When irradiated, the cathode releases electrons that are attracted by the positively
charged anode, thus producing a photocurrent proportional to the light intensity.
10.9.2
Photomultiplier Tubes
Photomultiplier tubes are extremely sensitive photosensors operating in the ultraviolet, visible and
near-infrared spectrum. PMTs have an internal gain of the order of 108 and can even detect single
photon of light. They are constructed from a glass vacuum tube which houses a photocathode, several
dynodes and an anode. When the incident photons strike the photocathode, electrons are produced as a
result of the photoelectric effect. These electrons accelerate towards the anode and, in the process,
electron multiplication takes place due to secondary emission processes from the dynodes. PMTs
require a few kilovolts of biasing voltages for proper operation. Figure 10.31 shows the cross-section
of a photomultiplier tube. As we can see from the ﬁgure, the dynodes are given progressively
increasing positive voltages with the dynode nearest to the cathode having the lowest voltage and the
dynode nearest to the anode having the maximum voltage.
Important features of photomultiplier tubes include low noise, high frequency response and large
active area. By virtue of these features, PMTs are used in nuclear and particle physics, astronomy,
medical imaging and motion picture ﬁlm scanning. Avalanche photodiodes have replaced PMTs in some
applications, but PMTs are still frequently used.

10.9.3
Image Intensiﬁers
Image intensiﬁers are devices that amplify visible and near-infrared light from an image so that a dimly lit
scene can be viewed by a camera or by human eye. Contemporary image intensiﬁers comprise an objective
lens, vacuum tube with photocathode at one end, tilted micro-channel plate (MCP) and a phosphor screen
(Figure 10.32). An objective lens focuses the image onto the photocathode. When the photons strike the
photocathode, electrons are released due to the photoelectric effect. These photoelectrons are accelerated
through around 4–5 kVinto a tilted MCP where secondary electron multiplication takes place. The electrons
all move together due to the potential difference across the tube and, for each photoelectron, hundreds or even
thousands of electrons are created. All these electrons hit the phosphor screen at the other end, releasing one
photon for every electron. The screen therefore converts the high-energy electrons into photons, which
corresponds to the input image radiation but with the incident ﬂux being ampliﬁed many times.
Image intensiﬁers are classiﬁed into the following categories: generation 0, generation 1, generation 2
and generation 3. Generation 0 and generation 1 devices did not have an MCP and the stream of electrons
generated by the photocathode was accelerated towards the phosphor screen by the applied potential.
Generation 1 devices were a tremendous improvement upon generation 0 devices, and had three times
the photosensitivity of generation 0 devices. Generation 2 devices introduced the concept of MCPs.

3 devices is gallium arsenide (GaAs) and for generation 2 devices is S-25. Generation 3 devices also have a
better MCP. Generation 3 ultra and generation 4 tubes are also available, which offer slight improvement
over generation 3 devices. Image intensiﬁers are used in night-vision devices for military applications.
10.10
Thermal Sensors
Thermal sensors absorb radiation, producing a temperature change that in turn causes a change in the
physical or the electrical property of the sensor. In other words, thermal sensors respond to a change in
their bulk temperature caused by the incident radiation. Thermocouple, thermopile, bolometer and
pyroelectric sensors belong to the category of thermal sensors. Thermal sensors lack the sensitivity of
photoelectric sensors and are generally slow in response, but have a wide spectral response. Most of these
sensors are passive devices, requiring no bias. In this section, we discuss the different types of thermal
sensors and their application circuits.
10.10.1
Thermocouple and Thermopile
Thermocouple sensors are based on the Seebeck effect, that is, the temperature change at the junction of
two dissimilar metals generates an electro-motive force (EMF) proportional to the temperature change.
The commonly used thermocouple materials are bismuth-antimony, iron-constantan and copper-
constantan, which have temperature coefﬁcients 100 mV C1, 54 mV C1 and 39 mV C1 respec-
tively. To compensate for the changes in the ambient temperature, thermocouples generally have two
junctions: a measuring junction and a reference junction.
The responsivity of a single thermocouple is very low; to increase this responsivity, several junctions
are connected in series to form a thermopile. Thermopiles are series combinations of around 20–200
thermocouples. The spectral response of thermocouples and thermopiles extends into the far-infrared
band up to 40 mm. They are suitable for making measurements over a large temperature range up to
1800 K. However, thermocouples are less suitable for applications where smaller temperature differ-
ences need to be measured with great accuracy, e.g. 0–100 C measurement with 0.1 C accuracy. For
such applications, thermistors and resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) are more suitable.
The responsivity of thermopiles is of the order 10–100 V W1 and the typical signal output varies from
a few tens of microvolt to a few millivolts. They therefore need a low-noise and very-low-offset
operational ampliﬁer for providing the gain. The gain required varies from as little as 10 to as large as
10 000 or more. Generally, for gain <1000, a single-stage ampliﬁer is used. For gain values >1000, two
stages are used. Figure 10.33 shows the application circuit where two ampliﬁer stages are used. As we
can see from the ﬁgure, thermopiles require no bias voltage.
Figure 10.33
Application circuit using thermopiles.
Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits
347

The thermopile signal is positive or negative depending upon whether the temperature of the object ﬁlling
the ﬁeld-of-view of the thermopile is greater than or less than that of the thermopile. The output of the circuit
varies with change in the ambient temperature which must be compensated for; many thermopile modules
therefore have an inbuilt thermistor to compensate for the ambient temperature variations.
10.10.2
Bolometer
The bolometer is the most popular type of thermal sensor. The sensing element in a bolometer is a
resistor with a high temperature coefﬁcient. A bolometer is different from a photoconductor in that a
direct photon–electron interaction causes a change in the conductivity of the material in the former,
whereas the increased temperature and the temperature coefﬁcient of the element causes the resistance
change in the bolometer. Bolometers can be further categorized as metal bolometers, thermistor
bolometers and low-temperature germanium bolometers.
A metal bolometer uses metals such as bismuth, nickel or platinum, having a temperature coefﬁcient
in the range 0.3–0.5% C1. A thermistor bolometer is the most popular and has applications in burglar
alarms, smoke sensors and other similar devices. The sensor in this case is a thermistor, an element made
of manganese, cobalt and nickel oxide. They have high temperature coefﬁcients up to 5% C1 which
vary with temperature as T2. They are classiﬁed as negative temperature coefﬁcient (NTC) and positive
temperature coefﬁcient (PTC) thermistors, depending whether their temperature coefﬁcient of resistance
is negative or positive.
Figure 10.34a shows the circuit symbol of a thermistor. The spectral response of thermistors extends
from 0.5 to 10 mm. More sensitive thermistors typically have NEP and response time of the order of
1010 Wand 100 ms. Less-sensitive thermistors have NEP and response time values of 108 Wand 5 ms,
respectively. Figure 10.34b and c show the simplest possible conﬁgurations in which a thermistor can be
used for measurement of light intensity. The output of the circuits in Figure 10.34b and c can be fed to an
operational ampliﬁer or to a comparator for linear light control or light on-off control, respectively.
A low-temperature germanium bolometer is a sensitive laboratory bolometer that uses germanium as
the sensor. It has the highest responsivity when operated at a few degrees above absolute zero.
10.10.3
Pyroelectric Sensors
Pyroelectric sensors are characterized by spontaneous electric polarization, which is altered by
temperature changes as light illuminates these sensors. Pyroelectric sensors are low-cost high-sensitivity
devices that are stable against temperature variations and electromagnetic interference. Pyroelectric
sensors only respond to modulating light radiation, and there is no output for a CW incident radiation.
Figure 10.35a shows the circuit symbol of pyroelectric sensors.
Figure 10.34
(a) Circuit symbol of a thermistor; and (b, c) application circuits of a thermistor.
348
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Pyroelectric sensors operate in two modes: voltage mode and current mode. In the voltage mode, the
voltage generated across the entire pyroelectric crystal is detected. In the current mode of operation,
current ﬂowing on and off the electrode on the exposed face of the crystal is detected. Voltage mode is
more commonly used than current mode.
The circuit for voltage mode is shown in Figure 10.35b. The operational ampliﬁer chosen should have
very high input impedance of the order of 1012–1014 ohms. The circuit is sensitive to ambient
temperature variations, however; ambient temperature variations can be compensated for by employing
AC coupling between the ampliﬁer stages or by adding a compensation crystal in opposition (either in
series or parallel). One crystal is exposed to radiation and the other is shielded from radiation. As the
ambient temperature changes, the surface charge generated on one crystal is cancelled by the equal and
opposite charge generated on the other crystal. The incident radiation however generates charge only on
one crystal and is not cancelled.
Voltage-mode pyroelectric sensors are generally integrated with a FET. A shunt resistor RS in
the range of 1010–1011 ohms is added to provide thermal stabilization. External connections
include a power supply and load resistor RL as shown in Figure 10.35c. The output voltage appears
across RL.
The circuit for current-mode operation is shown in Figure 10.35d. The modulation frequency can be
much higher in case of current-mode operation than for voltage-mode operation. It is therefore much
easier to separate the signal from the ambient temperature drift.

Displays
Displays are output devices that are used for visual presentation of information. Displays form an
interface between the machine and the human. In this section, we shall discuss different types of displays
and the characteristic parameters used to deﬁne the quality of displays.
10.11.1
Display Characteristics
Three factors are critical for a good visual display: legibility, brightness and contrast.
Legibility is the property of a display by virtue of which the characters are easy to read with speed and
accuracy. The factors which contribute to the legibility of the display are its style, size, character sharpness
and shape. Brightness refers to the perception of luminance by the visual world. The contrast of a display
depends on the background luminance and the source luminance. The readability of the display depends
upon the contrast parameter. It is deﬁned in different ways for passive and active displays. In the case of the
former such as liquid-crystal displays (LCDs), contrast C is deﬁned by Equation 10.26:
C ¼ ðLO  LBÞ=LO
(10.26)
where LO is the object or source luminance and LB is the background luminance (both measured in
Cd m2. Contrast can have values between 0 and 1, 0 being the case when the object and the background
luminance are the same and 1 when the background has zero luminance.
For active displays such as light-emitting diodes (LEDs), the contrast parameter is deﬁned in terms of
contrast ratio CR, deﬁned by Equation 10.27:
CR ¼ LO=LB
(10.27)
The contrast ratio can have values between 1 and inﬁnity. For contrast ratio equal to 1, the object and the
background have the same luminance and the displayed characters are not visible at all. The background
luminance is zero and the display has best visibility at contrast value equal to inﬁnity (CR ¼ 1).
10.11.2
Types of Displays
Displays can be categorized into different types depending upon the manner in which they display
information. These include bar graph displays, segmented displays, dot-matrix displays and large
displays.
Bar graph displays are composed of several bar elements as shown in Figure 10.36. These are
replacing analogue instruments as indicators due to their simplicity and cost-effectiveness.
Segmented displays are available in two conﬁgurations: 7-segment displays (Figure 10.37a) and
16-segment displays (Figure 10.37b).
A 7-segment display comprises 7 bars and 1 or 2 decimal points and is an industry standard for
numeric displays. These displays are used for displaying numerals and limited alphabet. A 16-segment
display can present the entire upper case alphabet and numerals. Segmented displays can present only
limited information.
Figure 10.36
Bar graph display.
350
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Dot matrix displays are the simplest displays that represent the set of lower-case and upper-case
alphabet and numerals at reasonable cost and complexity. The most commonly used dot matrix display
is the 5  7 display which comprises 35 display elements set in a pattern of 5 rows and 7 columns
(Figure 10.38). Each element is addressed selecting the relevant row and column. Bar, segmented and
5  7 dot-matrix displays can be constructed using LEDs or LCDs.
Large-scale displays include cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, plasma displays and LCD thin-ﬁlm
transistor (TFT) displays.
LEDs and LCDs are discussed in Sections 10.12 and 10.13, respectively, followed by CRT displays
and emerging trends in display technology in Sections 10.14 and 10.15, respectively.
10.12
Light-emitting Diodes
An LED is a semiconductor P-N junction diode designed to emit light when forward biased. It is one of
the most popular optoelectronics source. LEDs consume very little power and are inexpensive.
When a P-N junction is forward-biased, the electrons in the N-type material and the holes in the P-type
material travel towards the junction. Some of these holes and electrons recombine with each other and
radiate energy in the process. The energy will be released either in the form of photons of light or in the
form of heat. In silicon and germanium diodes, most of the energy is released as heat and the emitted light
is insigniﬁcant. However, in some materials such as gallium phosphide (GaP), gallium arsenide (GaAs)
and gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP), substantial photons of light are emitted. These materials are
therefore used in the construction of light-emitting diodes.

(a) 7-segment display; and (b) 16-segment display.

5  7 dot-matrix display.
Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits
351

In the absence of an externally applied voltage, the N-type material contains electrons while the P-type
material contains holes that can act as current carriers. When the diode is forward biased, the energy
levels shift and there is a signiﬁcant increase in the concentration of electrons in the conduction band on
the N-side and of holes in valence band on the P-side. These electrons and holes combine near the
junction to release energy in the form of photons (Figure 10.39). It may be mentioned here that the
process of light emission in a LED is that of spontaneous emission, that is, the photons emitted are not in
phase and travel in different directions.
The energy of the photon resulting from this recombination is equal to the band-gap energy of the
semiconductor material Eg (eV) and is deﬁned by the empirical formula given in Equation 10.28:
Eg ¼ 1240
l
(10.28)
where l is wavelength (nm).
Some of the commonly used semiconductor materials used for fabricating LEDs are GaAs, GaP,
GaAsP, aluminium antimonide (AlSb) and indium antimonide (InSb). Table 10.1 enlists the band-gap
energies and the typical wavelengths emitted by these materials.
10.12.1
Characteristic Curves
The parameters of interest in a LED are the I–V characteristics, spectral distribution curve, light output vs
input current and the directional characteristics.
Figure 10.40a shows the I–V characteristics of LEDs of different colours. As the LED is operated in the
forward-biased mode, the I–V characteristics in the forward-biased region are shown. I–V characteristics of
LEDs are similar to that of conventional P-N junction diodes, except that the cut-in voltage in the case of
LEDs is in the range 1.3–3 V compared to 0.7 V for silicon diodes and 0.3 V for germanium diodes.
The spectral distribution curve shows the variation of light intensity with wavelength. Figure 10.40b
shows the typical spectral curves for yellow, green and red LEDs. Figure 10.40c shows a typical light
output vs input current curve depicting the dependence of emitted light on forward current ﬂowing
through the LED. Finally, directional characteristics refer to the variation in the light output with change
in the viewing angle, as depicted in Figure 10.40d.

10.12.2
Parameters
The parameters of interest in the case of LEDs are forward voltage VF, candle power (CP), radiant power
output PO, peak spectral emission lP and spectral bandwidth.
Forward voltage VF is the DC voltage across the LED when it is on. Typical values for VF for LEDs are
in the range 1.3–3.0 V. As can be seen from Figure 10.40a, VF is near 1.5 V for yellow, green and red
LEDs. Candle power (CP) is a measure of the luminous intensity or the brightness of the light emitted by
the LED. It is the most important parameter of a LED. It is a non-linear function of LED current, and the
value of CP increases with an increase in the current ﬂowing through the LED. Radiant power output PO
is the light power output of the LED. Peak spectral emission lP is the wavelength where the intensity of
light emitted by the LED is a maximum. Spectral bandwidth gives an indication as to how concentrated
the brightest colour is around its nominal wavelength.
10.12.3
Drive Circuits
LEDs are operated in the forward-biased mode. As the current through the LED changes very rapidly
with change in the forward voltage above the threshold voltage, LEDs are current-driven devices.
Figure 10.41a shows a simple circuit for driving an LED. The resistor R is the current-limiting resistor
Figure 10.41

354
Lasers and Optoelectronics

used to limit the current ﬂowing through the LED. In this case, the I–V characteristics of the LED are
used to determine the voltage that needs to be applied to the LED to generate the desired forward current.
A silicon diode can be placed inversely parallel to the LED for reverse-polarity voltage protection. The
current that ﬂows through the LED is given by Equation 10.29:
I ¼ ðVCC  VFÞ=R
(10.29)
where VCC is the supply voltage.
Any change in the forward voltage of the LED due to temperature changes or variation from device to
device causes a change in the LED current. Moreover, there is power dissipation across the series resistor
R, resulting in reduced efﬁciency. A better drive circuit conﬁguration is one that employs a constant
current source as shown in Figure 10.41b. The current ﬂowing through the LED is determined by the
reference voltage VRef and the resistor R.
LEDs can also be used to display the logic output states. Figure 10.41c and d show typical logic circuits
that can be used to drive LEDs. Figure 10.41c uses a transistor-based switch while Figure 10.41d employs
a logic gate/buffer. In both these circuits, the LED glows when the voltage Vin is in the logic HIGH state.
When the light emitted by one LED is not sufﬁcient, several LEDs can be connected in series to
enhance the light level to the desired value. LEDs can be connected in series as shown in Figure 10.42a.
In a series connection, the current ﬂowing through each LED is the same. The value of the supply voltage
VCC should be sufﬁciently large to drive the desired number of LEDs. It should also be checked that the
series current ﬂowing in the circuit through each LED is within their operating range. The value of the
resistor R to be connected is given by Equation 10.30:
R ¼ ½VCC  ðVF1 þ VF2 þ VF3: . . . . . . þ VFnÞ=I
(10.30)
where VF1, VF2, . . . , VFn are the forward voltages across LED1, LED2, . . . , LEDn respectively.
LEDs can also be connected in parallel to enhance the output light level. However, more care is needed
in the case of parallel connection. Figure 10.42b shows the parallel connection of LEDs. The resistors R1,
R2, . . . , Rn are used to protect the diodes. If these resistors are not used, then the LED with the lowest
forward voltage will draw excess current and is likely to be damaged. The LED with the next-smallest
forward voltage will then be damaged, and this process will continue until all the LEDs are damaged. The
values of these resistors determine the current ﬂowing through individual LEDs.
Example 10.8
For the circuit shown in Figure 10.43, determine the current through the LED when (a) VB ¼ 0 V and
(b) VB ¼ 10 V. (VBE of both the transistors is 0.7 V and VCE(sat) of both the transistors is 0.2 V).

Solution
1. When VB ¼ 0 V, the transistor Q1 is in the cut-off region and there is no collector current ﬂowing
through the transistor. The base voltage of transistor Q2 is therefore equal to the reverse voltage of
Zener diode Z1. Therefore, the base voltage of transistor Q2 is VB2 ¼ 5 V.
2. The transistor Q2 is in the conducting mode and the voltage at the emitter terminal of transistor
Q2 ¼ VB2  0.7 V ¼ 5  0.7 V ¼ 4.3 V.
3. The emitter current ﬂowing through transistor Q2 ¼ VE2/RE ¼ 4.3/200 A ¼ 21.5 mA, where VE2 is the
emitter voltage of transistor Q2. As the collector current is approximately equal to the emitter current,
the value of IC ¼ 21.5 mA. The current ﬂowing through the LED is the same as the collector current of
the transistor. Therefore, the current ﬂowing through the LED is 21.5 mA.
4. When VB ¼ 10 V, transistor Q1 is in saturation. Therefore, the collector-emitter voltage of transistor
Q1 is VCE1 ¼ 0.2 V. The base voltage of transistor Q2, VB2 ¼ 0.2 V.
5. The transistor Q2 is in cut-off and the value of collector current is zero. Therefore, the current ﬂowing
through the LED is also zero.

Liquid-crystal Displays
Liquid crystals are materials that exhibit properties of both solids and liquids, that is, they are an
intermediate phase of matter. They can be classiﬁed into three different groups: nematic, smectic and
cholestric. Nematic liquid crystals are generally used in LCD fabrication, with twisted-nematic material
being the most common.
10.13.1
Construction
Figure 10.44a shows the construction of a twisted-nematic LCD display. As can be seen from the ﬁgure,
it comprises a cell of liquid-crystal ﬂuid, conductive electrodes, a set of polarizers and a glass casing.
Polarizers are components that polarize light in one plane. The polarizer attached to the front glass is
referred to as the front polarizer, while that attached to the rear glass is the rear polarizer. On the inner
surface of the glass casing, transparent electrodes are placed in the shape of the desired image. The
electrode attached to the front glass is referred to as the segment electrode while that attached to the rear
glass is the backplane or the common electrode. The patterns of the backplane and segment electrodes
form numbers, letters and symbols. The liquid crystal is sandwiched between the two electrodes. The
basic principle of operation of the LCD is to control the transmission of light by changing the
polarization of the light passing through the liquid crystal with the help of an externally applied

voltage. As LCDs do not emit their own light, backlighting is used to enhance the legibility of the display
in dark conditions. A variety of methods exist for backlighting LCD panels, such as use of incandescent
lamps, LEDs and electroluminescent lamps.
LCDs have the ability to produce both positive as well as negative images. A positive image is deﬁned
as a dark image on a light background. In a positive image display, the front and the rear polarizers are
perpendicular to each other. Light entering the display is guided by the orientation of the liquid-crystal
molecules that are twisted by 90 from the front glass plate to the rear glass plate. This twist allows the
incoming light to pass through the second polarizer as shown in Figure 10.44b. When voltage is applied,
the liquid-crystal molecules straighten out and stop redirecting light. As a result, light travels straight
through and is ﬁltered out by the second polarizer. No light can pass through, making this region darker
compared to the rest of the screen as shown in Figure 10.44c. In order to display characters or graphics,
voltage is applied to the desired regions making them dark and visible to the eye.
A negative image is a light image on a dark background. In negative image displays, the front and the
rear polarizer are aligned to each other.
10.13.2
Driving LCD
The LCD driver waveforms are designed to create a zero DC potential across all the pixels, as a DC voltage
deteriorates the LC ﬂuid such that it cannot be energized. LCDs are driven with symmetrical waveforms with
Figure 10.44
(a) Cross-section of a twisted-nematic LCD display; (b, c) twisted-nematic LCD operation.
Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits
357

less than 50mV DC component. Figure 10.45 shows the brightness vs the RMS drivevoltage curve for LCDs.
VON is the RMS voltage applied across the liquid crystal that creates an ON pixel, typically at the 90%
contrast level. VOFF or VTh is the RMS voltage across the liquid crystal when the contrast voltage reaches 10%
level. Another important speciﬁcation is the discrimination ratio, which is deﬁned as the ratio of VON to VOFF.
The discrimination ratio deﬁnes the contrast levels which the LCD panel will achieve.
LCDs can be classiﬁed as direct-drive and multiplex-drive displays depending upon the technique
used to drive them. Direct-drive displays, also known as static-drive displays, have an independent driver
for each pixel. The drive voltage in this case is a square waveform having two voltage levels, namely
ground and VCC as shown in Figure 10.46a. In the ﬁgure, segment 0 is the ON segment whereas segment
1 is the OFF segment. Direct-drive displays offer the best contrast ratios over a wide operating
temperature range. As the display size increases, the drive circuitry becomes very complex.
Multiplex-drive circuits are used for larger-size displays. These displays reduce the total number of
interconnections between the LCD and driver. They have more than one backplane and the driver
produces an amplitude-varying time-synchronized waveform for both the segments and backplanes.
Figure 10.46b shows a typical multiplexed segment and the backplane-drive waveforms. The segment 0
is inactive whereas segment 1 is active. Segment 0 is inactive since the voltage across the LCD never
crosses its activation threshold voltage.
10.13.3
Response Time
The LCD response time is deﬁned by the ON and OFF response times. ON time refers to the time required by
an OFF pixel to become visible after the application of proper drive voltage. The OFF time is deﬁned as the
time required by the ON pixel to turn OFF after the application of proper drive voltage. The response time of
LCDs varies widely with temperature and increases rapidly at low operating temperatures. LCDs can therefore
only operate at low temperatures when used along with temperature controllers. At high temperatures, the
liquid-crystal molecules begin to assume random orientations, resulting in the pixels on the positive image
display becoming completely dark while the pixels on the negative image become completely transparent.
Figure 10.47 shows the typical variation of the ON and the OFF times of a LCD display with temperature.
10.13.4
Types of LCD Displays
LCDs are non-emissive devices, that is, they do not generate light on their own. Depending upon the
mode of transmission of light in a LCD, they are classiﬁed as reﬂective, transmissive and transreﬂective
LCD displays.
Figure 10.45
Brightness vs drive voltage curve for LCD displays.
358
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Reﬂective LCD displays have a reﬂector attached to the rear polarizer which reﬂects incoming light
evenly back into the display. Figure 10.48 shows the principle of operation of reﬂective LCD displays.
These displays rely on the ambient light to operate and do not work in dark conditions; they produce only
positive images. The front and the rear polarizers are perpendicular to each other. These types of displays
are commonly used in calculators and digital wristwatches.

In transmissive LCD displays, back light is used as the light source. Most of these displays operate in the
negative mode, that is, the text will be displayed in light colour and the background is a dark colour. Figure
10.49 shows the basic construction of a transmissive display. Negative transmissive displays have front and
rear polarizers in parallel with each other whereas positive transmissive displays have the front and the rear

polarizers perpendicular to each other. Transmissive displays are good for very low light level conditions.
They offer very poor contrast when used in direct sunlight, because sunlight swamps out the backlighting.
These displays cannot be used in natural sunlight, but provide good- quality pictures indoors. They are
generally used in medical devices, electronics testing and measuring equipment and in laptops.
Transreﬂective displays are a combination of reﬂective and transmissive displays (Figure 10.50). A
white or silver translucent material is applied to the rear of the display, which reﬂects some of the
ambient light back to the observer. It also allows the backlight to pass through. They are good for displays
operating in varying light conditions. However, they offer poorer contrast ratios than reﬂective displays.
LCD displays can also be classiﬁed as passive or active LCD displays, depending upon the nature of
the activation circuit. Passive displays use components that do not supply their own energy to turn the
desired pixels ON or OFF. They are made up of a set of multiplexed transparent electrodes arranged in a
row/column pattern. To address a pixel, the column containing the pixel is sent a charge and the
corresponding row is connected to ground. Passive displays can have either direct-drive or multiplexed-
drive circuitry. For larger displays however, it is not possible or economical to have separate connections
for each segment. Also, as the number of multiplexed lines increase, the contrast ratio decreases due to
the cross-talk phenomenon where a voltage applied to the desired pixel causes the liquid-crystal
molecules in the adjacent pixels to partially untwist.
These inherent problems of passive displays are absent from active displays. Active displays use an
active device such as a transistor or a diode into each pixel which acts like a switch that precisely controls
the voltage that each pixel receives. Active displays are further classiﬁed as thin-ﬁlm transistor (TFT)
displays and thin-ﬁlm diode (TFD) displays, depending upon whether the active device used is a
transistor or a diode. In both these devices a common electrode is placed above the liquid-crystal matrix.
Below the liquid crystal is a conductive grid connected to each pixel through a TFTor a TFD. The gate of
each TFT is connected to the row electrode, the drain to the column electrode and the source to the liquid
crystal. The display is activated by applying the display voltage to each row electrode line by line. One of
the major advantages of active displays is that nearly all effects of cross-talk are eliminated.
10.13.5
Advantages and Disadvantages
As LCD displays are not active sources of light, they offer considerable advantages such as very low
power consumption, low operating voltages and good ﬂexibility. However, their response time is too
slow for many applications, they offer limited viewing angles and they are sensitive to temperature.
10.14
Cathode Ray Tube Displays
Cathoderaytube(CRT)displaysareusedinawiderangeofsystemsrangingfromconsumerelectronicsystems
(e.g. televisions and computer monitors) to measuring instruments (e.g. oscilloscopes) to military systems (e.g.
radar). ACRT display is a specialized vacuum tube in which the images are produced when the electron beam
strikes the ﬂuorescent screen. CRT displays can be monochrome displays as well as coloured displays.
Monochrome CRT displays comprise a single electron gun, a ﬂuorescent screen and an internal or
external mechanism to accelerate and deﬂect the electron beam. Figure 10.51 shows the cross-sectional

view of a CRT display. The electron gun produces a narrow beam of electrons which are accelerated by
the anodes. There are two sets of deﬂecting coils, namely the horizontal coil and the vertical coil. These
coils produce an extremely-low-frequency electromagnetic ﬁeld in the horizontal and vertical directions
to adjust the direction of the electron beam. CRT tubes also have a mechanism to vary the intensity of the
electron beam. In order to produce moving pictures in natural colours on the screen, complex signals are
applied to the deﬂecting coils and to the circuitry responsible for controlling the intensity of the electron
beam. This results in movement of the spot from right to left and top to bottom in a sequence of
horizontal lines referred to as a raster. The speed of the spot movement is so fast that the person viewing
the screen sees a constant image on the entire screen.
Coloured CRT displays comprise three electron guns, one each for the three primary colours (red, blue
and green). The CRT produces three overlapping images, one in each colour. This is referred to as the
RGB colour model.
CRT displays offer very high resolution and, as these displays emit their own light, very high values of
peak luminance. Moreover, these displays offer wide viewing angles of the order of 180. CRT display
technology is more mature as compared to alternative display technologies and is also cheaper.
Despite the signiﬁcant advantages offered by CRT displays as mentioned above, alternative display
technologies are slowly replacing CRT displays due to the drawbacks of the CRT displays: they are bulky
and consume signiﬁcant power. Moreover, they require high voltages to operate and cause fatigue and
strain to the human eye.
10.15
Emerging Display Technologies
This section provides an introduction to emerging display technologies including organic light-emitting
diodes (OLEDs), digital light-processing (DLP) technology, plasma displays, ﬁeld-emission displays
(FEDs) and electronic ink displays. All these display technologies are explained in brief in the following
sections (detailed descriptions are beyond the scope of the book).
10.15.1
Organic Light-emitting Diodes (OLEDs)
OLEDs are composed of a light-emitting organic material sandwiched between two conducting plates,
one of N-type material and the other of P-type material. When an electric potential is applied between

Lasers and Optoelectronics

these plates, holes are ejected from the P-type plate and electrons are ejected from the N-type plate. Due
to the recombination of these holes and electrons, energy is released in the form of light photons. The
wavelength of light emitted depends upon the band-gap energy of the semiconductor material used. In
order to produce visible light, band-gap energy of the semiconductor material is of the order 1.5–3.5 eV.
Depending upon their basic structure, OLEDs can be classiﬁed into three types: small-molecule
OLEDs (SMOLEDs), polymer LEDs (PLEDs) and dendrimer OLEDs. OLEDs can be driven using
passive as well as active matrix driver circuits.
As OLEDs are emissive devices, they offer signiﬁcant advantages compared to LCD displays, including
faster switching speeds, higher refresh rates, lower operating voltages and larger viewing angles.
10.15.2
Digital Light-processing (DLP) Technology
DLP technology makes use of an optical semiconductor device referred to as a digital micro-mirror
device (DMD) which is basically a precise light switch that can digitally modulate light through a
large number of microscopic mirrors arranged in a rectangular array. These mirrors are mounted on
tiny hinges and can be tilted away or towards the light source with the help of the DMD chip, thus
projecting a light or a dark pixel onto the screen. Use of DLP systems is currently limited to large
projection systems.
10.15.3
Plasma Display Panels (PDPs)
Plasma displays are composed of millions of cells sandwiched between two panels of glass. Two types of
electrode, namely the address electrodes and display electrodes, are also placed between the two glass
plates covering the entire screen. The address electrodes are printed on the rear glass plate and the
transparent display electrodes are located above the cells along the front glass plate. These electrodes are
perpendicular to each other, forming a grid network.
Each cell is ﬁlled with a xenon and neon gas mixture. The electrodes intersecting at a speciﬁc cell are
charged to excite the gas mixture in each cell. When the gas mixture is excited, plasma is created
releasing ultraviolet light which then excites the phosphor electrons located on the sides of the cells.
These electrons in turn release visible light and return to their lower energy state. Each pixel is composed
of three cells containing red, green and blue phosphors.
Plasma displays offer several advantages such as: each pixel generates its own light, offering large
viewing angles; superior image quality; and the image quality is not affected by the area of the display.
However, these displays are fragile in nature and are susceptible to burn-out from static images.
10.15.4
Field Emission Displays (FEDs)
Field emission displays (FEDs) function much like the CRT displays; the main difference is that the
former use millions of small electron guns to emit electrons at the screen, instead of just one electron gun
in the case of the latter. The extraction of electrons in FEDs is based on the tunnelling effect. FEDs
produce the same quality of image as produced by a CRT display, but without being bulky. These
displays can be as thin as LCD displays and as large as plasma displays.
10.15.5
Electronic Ink Displays
Electronic ink displays, also referred to as electronic paper, are active matrix displays making use of
pigments that resemble the ink used in print.
10.16
Optocouplers
An optocoupler, also referred to as an optoisolator, is a device that uses a short optical transmission path
to transfer signals between the elements of a circuit. Optocouplers are sealed units that house an optical
transmitting device and a photosensitive device that are coupled together optically. The optical path may
be air or a dielectric waveguide. Figure 10.52 shows the basic structure of an optocoupler.
Optoelectronic Devices and Circuits
363

The transmitter unit contains either a lamp, an LED or, in some cases, a laser diode. The receiver unit
may be a photodiode, a phototransistor, a photo-FET, a photo-SCR, a photo-DIAC, a photo-TRIAC, a
photoconductor or any other photosensitive material. As the coupling between the source and the
photosensor is optical, high isolation exists between the input and the output circuitry. Hence, low-power
sensitive circuits can be used to actuate high-power devices using optocouplers. In other words,
optocouplers are used in applications that require isolation between input and output signals. Opto-
couplers have also replaced low-power relays and pulse transformers in many applications. They can also
be used for applications such as the detection of objects, liquid level detection, smoke and fog detection
and end of tape detection.
Optocouplers with photodiodes (Figure 10.53a), phototransistors (Figure 10.53b), photo Darlington
transistors (Figure 10.53c), photoconductor (Figure 10.53d) and photo-FET (Figure 10.53e) sensors
at the receiving end are referred to as non-latching optocouplers. Optocouplers with photo-SCR
(Figure 10.54a), photo-DIAC (Figure 10.54b) and photo-TRIAC (Figure 10.54c) at the receiving
side are referred to as latching optocouplers.
10.16.1
Characteristic Parameters
The important parameters that deﬁne the performance of an optocoupler include forward optocoupling
efﬁciency, input to output isolation voltage, input current and bandwidth.
The forward optocoupling efﬁciency is speciﬁed in terms of the current transfer ratio (CTR). CTR is
the ratio of the output current to the input current. For logic output optocouplers, the coupling efﬁciency
is deﬁned as the input current to the LED that would cause a change in the logic state of the optocoupler’s
output. To ensure high coupling efﬁciency, the wavelength response of the receiver is matched to the
emission spectrum of the phototransmitter. Typical values of CTR range over 10–50% for optocouplers
having phototransistors as the photosensor and can even be as high as 200% for optocouplers having
photo Darlington transistors at the output.
Isolation voltage is the maximum permissible DC potential that can be allowed to exist between the
input and the output circuits. Typical values of isolation voltages offered by optocouplers are in the range
500–4000 V.
Input current is the maximum permissible forward current that is allowed to ﬂow into the transmitting
LED. Typical values of forward current fall within the range 10–100 mA.
The maximum collector-emitter voltage VCE(max) is applicable for optocouplers having phototransis-
tors at the output. It is deﬁned as the transistor’s maximum collector–emitter voltage rating. It limits the
supply voltage that can be applied to the output circuit.
Bandwidth determines the maximum signal frequency that can be successfully passed through the
optocoupler. The bandwidth of an optocoupler depends upon its switching speed. Optocouplers offer
bandwidths in the range 10 kHz–1 MHz, depending upon the device construction. To achieve faster
operating speeds, integrated photodiode-transistor sensors or Schottky transistors are used.

Application Circuits
The simplest way to visualize an optocoupler is in terms of its two important components: the input
optical transmitting element and the output photosensor. The transmitting and the receiving elements are
electrically isolated in an optocoupler, offering a lot of ﬂexibility in connecting them.
The transmitting element most commonly used in an optocoupler is an LED. The LED in an
optocoupler can be driven in a manner similar to that for a discrete LED. Figure 10.55 shows the various
conﬁgurations in which the LEDs in an optocoupler can be connected. These circuits are similar to those
discussed in Section 10.12 on LEDs. Figure 10.55a shows a conventional circuit for driving the LED.
The diode across the LED is used for protecting the LED against reverse polarity voltages. Figure 10.55b
and c show how to drive an LED using a transistor and a logic buffer, respectively. For both the circuits,
the LED is ON for logic HIGH input and is OFF for logic LOW input.
At the receiving side of the optocoupler, the photosensor used may be a photodiode, phototransistor,
photo Darlington transistor, photo-FET, photo-DIAC or a photo-TRIAC. Circuits for driving these
photosensors are similar to that used for driving discrete sensors. It may be mentioned here that how the
output circuit is conﬁgured is dependent upon the intended application.
In many cases, the phototransistors are simply connected as a light-operated switch as shown in
Figure 10.56a and b. The phototransistor is used in the pull-up mode in Figure 10.56a and in the pull-down

mode in Figure 10.56b. The output of the phototransistor can be connected to a logic gate, a transistor or an
operationalampliﬁer.AnoptocouplerwithaphotoDarlingtontransistorcanalsobedriveninasimilarmanner.
Figure 10.57 shows the application circuit of an optocoupler having a photo-DIAC as a photosensing
element. In the circuit, the photo-DIAC is used to trigger a TRIAC. The circuit employs a ﬁlter/delay
circuit comprising resistors R1 and R2 and capacitor C1 and also a snubber circuit across the TRIAC
comprising resistor RS and capacitor CS to ensure correct triggering with inductive loads.
Example 10.9
For the optocoupler circuit of Figure 10.58a, the voltage across the resistor R is 4 V. Determine the value
of the voltage VB applied to the base of the transistor Q1. The relationship between the input current
ﬂowing through the LED and the output phototransistor collector current is shown in Figure 10.58b. The
base-emitter voltage of transistor Q1 is equal to 0.7 V.
Solution
1. The current ﬂowing across the resistor R ¼ 4/(4  103) A ¼ 1  103 A ¼ 1 mA.
2. The collector current of the phototransistor IC is equal to the current across resistor R; therefore,
IC ¼ 1 mA.

3. From the curve of Figure 10.58b, the input current ﬂowing through the LED is approximately equal to
1.1 mA.
4. The current ﬂowing through the LED is equal to the collector current of transistor Q1.
5. As the collector current of the transistor is approximately the same as its emitter current, the emitter
current is equal to 1.1 mA.

Example 10.10
The optocoupler-based circuit of Figure 10.59a is used to provide isolation from the power line and
detect zero crossings of the line voltage. The relationship between the input LED current and the output
current of the phototransistor for the optocoupler is shown in Figure 10.59b. Draw the output waveform
VO(t). Assume the diodes to be ideal.
Solution
1. The bridge rectiﬁer produces a full-wave rectiﬁed output. The current through the LED is therefore
also a full-wave rectiﬁed waveform. The peak current through the LED is ILEDpeak ¼ (1.414  220)/
15.55  103 A ¼ 20  103 A ¼ 20 mA.
2. The value of collector current when the phototransistor is in saturation ICsat ¼ 10/(5  103) A ¼
2  103 A ¼ 2 mA.
3. From Figure 10.59b, the collector current corresponding to the LED current of 20 mA is 14 mA. The
collector current of the phototransistor never reaches 14 mA, as it saturates at 2 mA.
4. The transistor is saturated during most of the cycle as the transistor saturates for all values of LED
currents that produce more than 2 mA of phototransistor collector current. Therefore, the output
voltage is zero for most of the cycle.
5. When the line voltage changes polarity, i.e. when zero crossings occur, the LED current drops to zero.
The phototransistor stops conducting and the output voltage is equal to the supply voltage 10 V, i.e.
VO(t) ¼ 10 V.
6. Figure 10.60 shows the output waveform.

Summary
 Photosensors are classiﬁed as either photoelectric sensors or thermal sensors. Photoelectric sensors –
which can either depend on the external photo effect for their operation or make use of some kind of
internal photo effect –include the photoemissive sensors, photoconductors and junction-type photo-
sensors. Thermal sensors include thermocouples (or thermopiles), bolometric sensors and pyroelectric
sensors.

 Radiometry is the study of the properties and characteristics of electromagnetic radiation and the
sources and receivers of electromagnetic radiation. Photometry is the science that deals with visible
light and its perception by human vision.
 Important photometry and radiometry parameters include radiometric and photometric ﬂux, radio-
metric and photometric intensity, radiant incidence (irradiance) and illuminance and radiant sterance
(radiance) and luminance.
 Parameters used to characterize the performance of photosensors include responsivity, noise equiv-
alent power (NEP), sensitivity (usually measured as detectivity D and D), quantum efﬁciency,
response time, noise and spectral response.
 Responsivity is deﬁned as the ratio of electrical output to radiant light input determined in the linear
region of the response. It is measured in AW1 or V W1 if the photosensor produces a voltage output
rather than a current output.
 NEP is the input power to a sensor which generates an output signal current equal to the total internal noise
current of the device, which implies a signal to noise ratio of 1. Detectivity D of a sensor is the reciprocal of
its NEP. D is deﬁned as detectivity normalized to an area of 1cm2 and a noise bandwidth of 1 Hz.
 Quantum efﬁciency is deﬁned as the ratio of the number of photoelectrons released to the number of
photons of incident light absorbed.
 Response time is deﬁned as rise/fall time parameter in photoelectric sensors and as time constant
parameter in thermal sensors. Rise and fall times are the time durations required by the output to
change from 10% to 90% and from 90% to 10% of the ﬁnal response respectively. It determines the
highest signal frequency to which a sensor can respond. Time constant is deﬁned as the time required
by the output to reach 63% of the ﬁnal response from zero initial value.
 Sensor noise mainly comprises Johnson noise, shot noise, generation-recombination noise and ﬂicker
noise. Johnson noise, also known as Nyquist or thermal noise, is caused by the thermal motion of
charged particles in a resistive element. Shot noise in a photosensor is caused by the discrete nature of
the photoelectrons generated. Generation-recombination noise is caused by the ﬂuctuation in current
generation and the recombination rates in a photosensor. Flicker noise or 1/f noise occurs in all
conductors where the conducting medium is not a metal and exists in all semiconductor devices that
require bias current for their operation.
 Photoconductors, also referred to as photoresistors, light-dependent resistors (LDRs) and photocells,
are semiconductor photosensors whose resistance decreases with increasing incident light intensity.
They are bulk semiconductor devices with no P-N junction.
 Photodiodes are junction-type semiconductor light sensors that generate current or voltage when the
P-N junction in the semiconductor is illuminated by light of sufﬁcient energy. The spectral response of
the photodiode is a function of the band-gap energy of the material used in its construction.
 Depending upon their construction, photodiodes can either be PN, PIN, Schottky or avalanche
photodiodes.
 PN photodiodes comprise a PN junction and are used for precision photometry applications. In PIN
photodiodes, an extra high resistance intrinsic layer is added between the P and the N layers to improve
the response time. A thin layer of gold coating is sputtered on to the N-type material to form a Schottky
effect P-N junction, which has enhanced ultraviolet response. An avalanche photodiode (APD) is a
high-speed high-sensitivity photodiode which utilizes an internal gain mechanism that functions by
applying a high reverse-bias voltage of the order 30–200 V.
 Solar cells are devices whose operation is based on the photovoltaic effect; when exposed to light
(solar radiation), an open-circuit voltage is generated across a P-N junction. This open-circuit voltage
leads to the ﬂow of electric current through a load resistance connected across it.
 Photo-FETs are light-sensitive FET devices where the diode formed by the reverse-biased gate-
channel junction acts as a photodiode. Incident light generates additional photocarriers,
resulting in increased conductivity. Gate current ﬂows if the gate is connected to an external
resistor.
 Photo-SCRs, generally referred to as light-activated SCRs (LASCRs) are essentially the same as
conventional SCRs except that they are triggered by light incident on the gate junction area.

Photo-TRIACs, also referred to as light-activated TRIACs, are bidirectional thyristors that are
designed to conduct current in both directions when the incident light radiation exceeds a
speciﬁed threshold value.
 Photoemissive sensors rely on the external photo effect where the photo-generated electrons travel
beyond the physical boundaries of the material. Some of the commonly used photoemissive photo-
sensors include vacuum photodiodes, photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and image intensiﬁer tubes.
 A vacuum photodiode comprises an anode and a cathode placed in a vacuum envelope. Photomultiplier
tubes are extremely sensitive photosensors operating in the ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared spectrum.

a camera or by a human eye. Contemporary image intensiﬁers comprise an objective lens, vacuum tube
with photocathode at one end, tilted micro-channel plate and a phosphor screen.
 Displays are output devices that are used for visual presentation of information. The three factors
critical for good visual display are: legibility, brightness and contrast.
 Displays can be categorized into different types depending upon the manner in which they display
information. These include bar graph displays, segmented displays, dot-matrix displays and large
displays. Bar graph displays are composed of several bar elements. A 7-segment display comprises
7 bars and 1 or 2 decimal points and is an industry standard for numeric displays.
 A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor P-N junction diode designed to emit light when
forward biased.
 Liquid-crystals are materials that exhibit properties of both solids and liquids, that is, they are an
intermediate phase of matter.
 A CRT display is a specialized vacuum tube in which the images are produced when the electron beam
strikes the ﬂuorescent screen. CRT displays can be monochrome displays as well as coloured displays.
 An organic light-emitting diode (OLED) is composed of light-emitting organic materials sandwiched
between two conducting plates, one of N-type material and the other of P-type material.
 Digital light processing (DLP) technology makes use of an optical semiconductor precise light switch
named digital micro-mirror device (DMD) that can digitally modulate light through a large number of
microscopic mirrors arranged in a rectangular array.
 Field emission displays (FED) function much like CRT displays, with the main difference being that
these displays use millions of small electron guns to emit electrons at the screen instead of just one in
case of CRT displays.
 Plasma displays are composed of millions of cells sandwiched between two panels of glass. Two types
of electrodes (address and display electrodes) are also placed between the two glass plates covering the
entire screen.
 Electronic ink displays, also referred to as electronic paper, are active matrix displays making use of
pigments that resemble the ink used in print.
 An optocoupler is a device that uses a short optical transmission path to transfer a signal between the
elements of a circuit. Optocouplers are sealed units that house an optical transmitter and a receiver that
are coupled together optically.

Laser Applications

Lasers in Industry
11.1
Introduction
Although the laser was invented in 1960, new applications are still being found. Over the years, lasers
have either completely replaced existing processes and techniques or enhanced their performance
efﬁcacy. As a result, lasers have a use in every conceivable area of application. One of the most
widespread uses of laser technology has been in industry, as was evident during the period immediately
after the invention of this magical device. The majority of industrial applications of lasers relate to
material processing, and we discuss in detail the key industrial applications in this chapter. Material-
processing applications include cutting, welding, drilling, marking, rapid prototyping and photo-
lithography. Laser printing is another common application of lasers in industry. We focus on the
principles behind the application, the merits and limitations and the different types of laser system
conﬁgurations.
11.2
Material-processing Applications
Laser-based material processing is a versatile technology that has the required ﬂexibility to process a
wide range of materials for various applications, such as cutting, welding, drilling, marking, rapid
manufacturing, ablation and so on. Due to its advantages of non-contact processing, high positioning
accuracy, a narrow heat-affected zone and a high processing speed, the laser is the preferred choice for a
wide range of material-processing applications. Such applications range from routine operations to more
complex processes such as cutting ﬁne intricate cardiovascular stents, drilling guide vanes in the
aerospace industry and welding thick steel in the ship-building industry. In the following sections we
discuss the classiﬁcation of laser material-processing applications followed by important processing
considerations and the advantages and limitations of the technology.
11.2.1
Classiﬁcation
Laser-based material-processing applications can be classiﬁed into one of the two major groups as
follows:
1. those requiring limited laser power/energy and causing no signiﬁcant change in phase or state of the
material before and after processing; and
2. those involving phase changes and requiring higher power/energy to induce those changes from solid
to liquid or solid to vapour phase.
Lasers and Optoelectronics: Fundamentals, Devices and Applications, First Edition. Anil K. Maini.
 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published 2013 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

Operations such as curing, annealing and marking fall within the ﬁrst category. Common applications
belonging to the second category include cutting, drilling and welding. A more practical way of
classifying material-processing applications is:
1. forming (e.g. rapid manufacturing, deposition, bending/straightening);
2. joining (e.g. welding, brazing, soldering);
3. machining (e.g. cutting, drilling, marking); and
4. surface engineering (e.g. surface hardening, surface alloying, amorphization).
11.2.2
Important Considerations
All laser-based material-processing applications involve the use of a pulsed or continuous wave (CW)
laser beam, which is directed to strike the surface of the work piece for the intended operation. When the
laser beam strikes the surface of the work piece, only three possible processes can occur: transmission,
reﬂection and absorption. That is, part of the incident laser power/energy is transmitted, part is reﬂected
and a part of it is absorbed. The sum of these three fractions is 1. Different material-processing
applications can be better understood by analyzing the three phenomena. In most applications, a
signiﬁcant proportion of the laser energy is absorbed. The quantum of laser energy absorbed is of
primary interest in material-processing applications, and is mainly dependent upon the properties of the
actual material and on the laser parameters.
11.2.2.1
Material Properties: Absorption Length and Diffusion Length
Light is absorbed in the form of electronic and vibration excitation of the atoms. The absorbed laser
energy is converted into heat, leading to an increase in temperature of the material which increases the
fraction of laser energy absorbed by the material. This is a cumulative process, resulting in a rapid rise in
temperature in a very short time (e.g. a millisecond or so for welding applications). The rate of
temperature rise depends on the rates of energy absorption and energy dissipation by the material. Laser
energy is absorbed up to a depth called absorption length, which is the depth where incident laser
intensity drops to 37% of the original value. Absorbed energy is converted into thermal energy that is
diffused into the material. The diffusion length is directly proportional to the square root of the product of
thermal diffusivity and laser pulse width. The temperature rise at the laser spot depends upon the relative
proportion of absorption length and diffusion length. The temperature rise is very rapid if the diffusion
length is much smaller than the absorption length. If the diffusion length is much longer than the
absorption length, there is a limited temperature rise.
11.2.2.2
Laser Parameters
Laser parameters of importance in material-processing applications include: wavelength, pulse width,
pulse energy, power density (also called intensity), repetition rate and average power for pulsed lasers,
and laser beam quality deﬁned by the M2 value.
Wavelength plays an important part in determing what fraction of incident laser energy is absorbed by
a given material and also the reaction of the material. The energy quantum of each photon of light is a
function of wavelength. If photon energy is high enough, it may even break an atomic bond under certain
special conditions. The majority of laser processes are however thermal in nature, governed by well-
controlled melting and vaporization processes. The wavelength absorption spectrum of the material is a
very important factor in laser-based material processing. For example, in the case of metals laser energy
is partially absorbed and partially reﬂected with practically no transmission. Metals are also poor
absorbers of CO2 laser energy at 10.6 mm, meaning that CO2 lasers are not very suitable for working with
metals. CO2 lasers can however be used for processing metals for cutting and welding operations if the
energy density is very high, compensating for the loss due to inadequate absorption. The absorption
fraction increases as wavelength decreases. On the other hand, ceramics and glasses have good
absorption at both lower and higher wavelengths. Ceramics are relatively more difﬁcult to process
382
Lasers and Optoelectronics

due to their poorer thermal shock characteristics and higher melting points. Due to their poor thermal
conductivity, glasses are easily melted. Plastics absorb laser energy even better than ceramics and
glasses, especially in the UV and CO2 regions. Certain speciﬁc wavelengths in the UV range have
sufﬁcient energy to break atomic bonds, and these wavelengths can be used to selectively alter the
surface properties of a material and even the properties below the surface if the material has a certain
transparency.
Pulse width is another very important laser parameter affecting the quantum of laser energy absorbed
by the material and subsequent rise in its temperature. Pulsed lasers are used in most material-processing
applications. CW lasers are mainly used for cutting, welding and heat-treatment applications. Since
temperature rise is determined by relative values of absorption and diffusion lengths, for a given class of
materials with similar absorption length the optimum pulse width depends on the thermal diffusivity of
the material. For example, longer pulse widths can be used for micromachining operations on stainless
steel compared to nickel, due to the poorer thermal conductivity of nickel. Similarly, silicon requires
shorter pulse widths to produce ablation compared to nickel, due to the high thermal conductivity of
silicon. Due to a higher power density and shorter time frame, pulse widths of the order of femtoseconds
are capable of knocking off atoms from the surface of the material without affecting adjacent atoms. This
makes them highly suitable for micromachining operations.
Pulse energy and spot diameter together determine the power density. Although pulse width
determines the rise in temperature, it is not sufﬁcient to determine the efﬁcacy for a given material-
processing application. Pulse energy needs to be sufﬁciently high to heat up a useful volume of the
material to be processed in each pulse. After selecting a suitable wavelength for a given application,
pulse energy and pulse width together determine the quality of processing. For enhanced performance,
pulse energy can be modiﬁed to allow a ramp-up of energy at the beginning followed by a gradual cool-
down towards the end of pulse.
The repetition rate of pulsed lasers is also important. For a given value of pulse energy, it is the
repetition rate that determines the average power. While wavelength and pulse width determine the
initial reaction, average power controls the process rate.
Beam quality or M2 value also plays an important role in determining the laser spot diameter for a
given pulse energy and therefore the power density. The closer the value of M2 to 1, the tighter the focus.
An M2 value close to 1 is preferred for micromachining. For welding and heat-treatment applications, a
larger value of M2 in the range 30–100 is generally used. A higher beam quality associated with a lower
M2 value offers ﬁner-feature machining, improved process robustness and overall superior process
results. In addition to allowing for small spot sizes, a low M2 value results in an increased depth of focus
when the beam is focused to a particular spot size. A common misperception is that, regardless of the
value of M2, suitable optics will always give the desired laser spot size for the targeted feature; however,
if high- and low-M2 beams are focused to the same spot size, the low-M2 beam will have a longer
Rayleigh range and hence a better tolerance for system defocusing.
11.2.3
Common Material-processing Applications
Although all materials can be processed by laser, the processes for some materials are better-established
than others. The list includes metals, plastics, ceramics, cloth, diamonds and even human tissue.
Common material-processing applications of lasers include cutting, welding, drilling, marking, photo-
lithography, micromachining, rapid manufacturing, photolithography and laser printing.
The laser cutting process involves a high-intensity infrared laser beam focused onto the surface of the
work piece with the help of optics. This heats up the material and creates a localized melt throughout
the depth of the work piece. A gas jet acting coaxially with the laser beam removes the molten material.
The laser beam is moved across the surface to produce the cut. Cutting by laser is a fast method of
obtaining a narrow cut width with reduced material waste. The cutting process is far safer than its
mechanical counterpart and it can be a fully computer-numerical-controlled (CNC) non-contact process.
In the case of laser welding, a high-energy pulsed laser beam is focused onto the surface of the work
piece with the help of either bulk optics or a ﬁbre-optics module. The high energy density in the focused
Lasers in Industry
383

laser beam penetrates, vaporizes and melts some of the metal; joining of the two parts is established as
the common melt solidiﬁes. The advantages of laser welding include low heat input and a small heat-
affected zone, which makes it ideal for products that require welding near electronics and glass-to-metal
seals. Pulsed lasers are used to weld thin materials and CW lasers are used for deep welds.
Laser drilling generally occurs through the processes of melting and vaporization; it is also referred to
as ablation when the energy of a focused laser beam is absorbed. The drilling operation largely depends
upon pulse energy and duration. Use of laser drilling has been common since the 1970s for drilling of
gemstones in wire dies and watch jewels. Present-day applications include drilling of cooling holes in
aircraft engine blades and combustors, inkjet nozzles, fuel injector nozzles, cigarette ﬁlter paper and vias
in printed circuit boards (PCBs). Laser drilling is the preferred choice in these applications due to its
ability to drill high-quality small holes at high speed in most materials.
Laser marking is one of the most widely exploited industrial applications of lasers. Laser marking
could be in the form of an alphanumeric code imprinted on a label or surface of a product carrying
information such as manufacturing data, expiry date or serial/part number, a machine-readable barcode
or a two-dimensional symbol. In addition to the above-mentioned processes (classiﬁed as laser coding),
commercially available laser-marking machines are also equipped to perform functional and decorative
markings. Laser marking is primarily a surface process; the pulsed laser light is absorbed by the work
piece and is converted into heat. The short pulse width (of the order tens of nanoseconds to several
microseconds) causes an instantaneous rise in temperature, leaving a resultant mark. Commonly used
types of lasers for laser-marking equipment include Nd:YAG, CO2 and excimer lasers.
Laser micromachining has applications in many high-technology areas where high-precision micro-
fabrication is an enabling technology. Laser micromachining offers many distinct advantages over
conventional mechanical, chemical, ion or particle beam processes, including: high-resolution precision
non-contact processing and unlimited material coverage; the ability to machine ﬂat and multicontoured
surfaces; and multiprocess compatibility. Commonly used lasers for micromachining applications
include excimer, Nd:YAG, CO2 and metal vapour lasers.
Laser rapid manufacturing is a new class of technology used to fabricate engineering components
directly from computer-aided design data. This is also known as additive manufacturing, layered
manufacturing, solid freeform manufacturing, e-manufacturing or digital manufacturing. Unlike sub-
tractive machining (e.g. CNC machining which removes material to form the ﬁnal part), this is an
additive process that deposits layers of material to form the ﬁnal part. The laser is used here as a heat
source. Rapid manufacturing has widespread use in the fabrication of models and prototypes, patterns
and functional components. Rapid manufacturing is well established for the fabrication of large products
from metals, plastics and composite materials in the military and aerospace industry, but also of small
products and microsystem applications in medical, consumer electronics, diagnostics and sensor
technologies.
Photolithography is an important process in the semiconductor industry for the fabrication of
semiconductor devices and integrated circuits to selectively remove parts of a thin ﬁlm or bulk
of a substrate. Photolithography makes use of light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask
onto a photoresist on the substrate. Chemical treatment enables deposition of a new material in the
desired pattern on the substrate material. The resolution at which the pattern can be transferred to the
photoresist is an important parameter in the fabrication of integrated circuits, more so for ultra-large-
scale integrated (ULSI) circuits. Higher resolution is desirable to produce denser and faster chips.
Gas-discharge lamp-based lithography processes operating at relatively larger wavelengths cannot
meet this requirement. Excimer lasers emitting in the ultraviolet wavelength band are the preferred
laser sources in photolithography, and have largely replaced conventional gas-discharge mercury
lamps emitting in the ultraviolet band. Low wavelengths, such as the 193 nm of an argon ﬂuoride
laser, offer greater resolution.
Laser printing uses a non-impact photocopier technology. The process is very similar to xerography,
with the printing mechanism involving the same basic steps of charging, exposure, development, transfer
and fusing. Laser printers have higher print capacity and print speed, higher resolution and lower
operational costs (but higher initial costs) compared to inkjet printers.

11.2.4
Advantages
The general advantages of laser processing, applicable to all processes, include the following:
1. contact-less material processing (offering a tool that never becomes ‘blind’);
2. high positioning accuracy, allowing laser beam positioning on areas that are difﬁcult to reach or access;
3. a small heat-affected zone, so only the desired area of the work piece is processed with no affect on
neighbouring areas;
4. high-speed material processing since light is not affected by inertia;
5. ﬂexibility, versatility and easy adaptation to automation and computer control (particularly advanta-
geous in rapid manufacturing); and
6. reduced processing times and cost (through reduced wages and tool costs) and increased production
and quality.
In addition to the important general features of laser material processing outlined above, it also offers
speciﬁc advantages for various applications:
1. Laser cutting: the cut width can be extremely small with the result that evaporated material volume is
minimal; in most cases, there is no requirement for post-cut ﬁnishing; difﬁcult materials (e.g.
asbestos and glass ﬁbre) can be cut without leaving dust; equally effective for cutting of soft materials
(e.g. rubber) without deforming or damaging the material; 2D and 3D cutting of metals with a
thickness of greater than 30 mm is possible.
2. Laser drilling: drilling of very small diameter holes; high-quality drilling of cooling holes in aircraft
engine blades and combustors, inkjet nozzles and fuel injector nozzles.
3. Laser welding: electron-beam-like welding operation without a vacuum; welding without any
additional material; different materials can be easily welded; point welding on miniature and
sensitive parts; welding of ceramics.
4. Laser heat-treatment processing: produces hardened surfaces by a metallurgical transformation of
speciﬁc areas without the need for bulk heating of the entire part; allows re-melting of special alloys
to enhance certain features such resistance-to-abrasion and corrosion stability.
Laser processing provides possibilities for many non-conventional industrial applications, material-
processing applications in particular. It can be used for: precise control of chemical processes through
localized heating or selective excitation of molecules; precise drilling of deep holes or making a
molecular sieve from an opaque sheet material; instantaneously sterilizing of precise areas for food or
pharmaceutical industry needs; cutting, welding or fusing of metals and hard-to-work materials such as
heat-resistant refractory materials; and separating selected isotopes from mixtures, split friable materials
and degas materials in high-vacuum systems.
11.3
Laser Cutting
Laser technology has made possible numerous industrial processes not previously possible with
conventional mechanical operations. It has redeﬁned the speed of production line manufacturing and
the range of industrial applications. Using the directed energy of laser radiation to cut materials is one of
the most widely used industrial applications of lasers today. Being a non-contact process, laser cutting
does not contaminate the material being cut; a small focus spot generates a very ﬁne cut that does not
require any post-cut processing.
11.3.1
Basic Principle
Laser cutting refers to the use of a directed high-energy infrared-emitting high-repetition-rate pulsed
laser or high-power CW laser to cut the material. The different steps involved in laser cutting are brieﬂy
outlined in this section.
Lasers in Industry
385

The high-power infrared laser beam pulsed or CW is tightly focused onto the intended location on
the surface of the work piece with the help of focusing optics. The focus spot diameter is in the range
of 25–100 mm for ﬁne cutting and 100–300 mm for cutting thicker sections. The laser energy is
transformed into heat energy, which produces a localized melt throughout the depth of the material;
this localized melt diameter is generally less than 0.5 mm. The molten material is blown away from
the area by a pressurized gas jet acting coaxially with the laser beam to accelerate the cutting
process. Oxygen and air are generally used to promote the cutting of ferrous alloys and cellulose
materials. Air is often used with plastics and fabrics. In the case of some metals requiring
an unoxidized cutting edge with little dross (re-solidiﬁed metal at the lower edge of a deep
cut), a high-pressure inert gas is used. The laser beam is moved across the surface of the material
producing the cut. Movement of the laser spot is achieved either by laser beam scanning or by
moving the sheet of material in the x–y direction. Figure 11.1 depicts the schematic arrangement of
the laser cutting process.

Laser Cutting vs Plasma Cutting
A large number of technologies are available for cutting metals and other materials, such as laser cutting,
plasma cutting, mechanical and thermal machining, ﬂame cutting, electro-discharge machining and
abrasive jet cutting. Laser and plasma cutting are the most widely used processes in metal cutting in
industry. While laser cutting makes use of the directed energy of a high-power laser for cutting, plasma
cutting (also called plasma arc cutting) uses electrically conducting gases such as argon, hydrogen,
nitrogen, oxygen and air to generate a plasma arc from input electrical energy. Plasma cutting equipment
typically comprises a source of electrical energy, an arc initiation circuit and a plasma gun that generates
a directed ﬂow of plasma. In the following we present a comparison of the merits and demerits of laser
cutting and plasma arc cutting techniques.
Laser cutting yields higher precision and accuracy and causes negligible surface cracking. It is faster;
for example, a 1500 W CO2 laser cutting machine can cut a 2.5-mm-thick mild steel sheet at a rate of
7.5 m min1 or a 5-mm-thick acrylic sheet at a rate of 12 m min1. Laser cutting is suitable for all metals
except copper and aluminium (which reﬂect a large fraction of the incident energy). It can also be used to
cut plastics, wood and glasses effectively. It is hard to cut materials thicker than 15 mm using laser
cutting; laser cutting is less efﬁcient and more expensive than plasma cutting in this case. Laser cutting is
not effective for cutting materials of different melting points; plasma cutting has no such limitation.
From the viewpoint of safety considerations, laser cutting is better than plasma cutting (but it is
recommended to use safety glasses while working with a laser cutting machine).
The plasma cutting process can cut any metal, including copper and aluminium, up to a thickness of
150 mm. It is less expensive, but adversely affects the area surrounding the cut (laser cutting has a very
narrow heat-affected zone). Plasma cutting generally leaves a dross or re-solidiﬁed metal at the lower
edge of the cut. Safety glasses are essential while working with plasma cutting equipment.
11.3.3
Laser Cutting Processes
Laser cutting technology today is well established and widely used in industry for cutting both ferrous
and non-ferrous metals and non-metals such as polymers, ceramics, glasses, wood and fabric. A number
of laser cutting processes are in use, each suited to a speciﬁc class of materials. In some cases, a
combination of more than one process is used for better results. Commonly used laser cutting processes:
1. melt shearing or fusion cutting;
2. vaporization cutting or boiling;
3. chemical degradation or burning;
4. oxidation cutting;
5. thermal stress cracking; and
6. scribing.
In the case of melt shearing or fusion cutting mechanism, the focused laser energy heats up the
material to the melting point. A high-pressure gas jet is used to blow the molten material out of the
cutting area. Due to the removal of the molten material by gas jet, the temperature of the material does
not need to be raised any further. The resulting cut edge is of good quality, but may be covered with some
microscopic ripples. The lower edge of the cut generally has a residue of re-solidiﬁed melt (dross) since
not all melt is blown away from the cutting area. This is particularly true for larger-thickness materials.
This technique is common for cutting metals such as mild and carbon steels and thermoplastics including
polyethylene, polystyrene, polypropylene and polyamide. Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polymethyl
methacrylate such as plexiglas, acrylic, and so on cannot be cut by this technique. The former degrades
chemically when heated to produce corrosive and highly toxic hydrogen chloride fumes, and the latter
vaporizes rather than melts. PVC may be cut using a melt-shearing mechanism, providing adequate
ventilation arrangements are made.
A CO2 laser with power output in the range 100–1500 W is generally used to cut thermoplastics. To a
ﬁrst approximation, maximum material thickness that can be cut using this technique varies linearly with
Lasers in Industry
387

power in this range. Typically, a 500 W laser can cut a 10 mm thick sheet of a thermoplastic material at a
rate of 0.5–1.5 m min1 depending upon the actual material.
In the case of vaporization cutting, the focused laser beam heats the material surface to the boiling
point and generates a keyhole. This increases absorptivity, thus deepening the keyhole. The boiling
vapours are blown away from the cut zone by a gas jet. As the vapours are blown away, they leave behind
a thin liquid layer on the cut edges. If the velocity of the gas jet is kept less than a certain maximum value,
the liquid layer dries up producing a glossy-edged cut. For velocities higher than this, the solidifying
liquid layer becomes frosted. Thermoplastics such as plexiglas and acrylic are cut by this technique.
The chemical degradation or burning technique of cutting is common for cutting thermoset plastics
such as epoxy and phenolic resins, kevlar and natural rubber products. The focused laser energy burns the
work piece, reducing it to a smoke containing carbon and other constituents of the material. The cut edge
is generally ﬂat, smooth and covered with a thin layer of carbon. The maximum material thickness that
can be cut and cutting speed are lower compared to those achievable with the melt shearing technique.
This is due to the process requiring a higher input energy than the melting process. Wood-based products
are also cut by a similar mechanism.
The oxidation cutting mechanism, also known as ﬂame cutting or reactive cutting, is basically a
combination of the processes of melt shearing and chemical reaction with the cutting gas jet, which is
oxygen. The cutting equipment is like an oxygen torch with laser as the source of ignition. This technique
is very common for cutting mild and carbon steels. It can cut thick sheets of steel at high speed,
producing high-quality dross-free cut edges. A 1500 W CO2 laser cutting machine using oxidation
cutting can achieve a cutting speed of about 1 m min1 for a 10-mm-thick sheet of mild steel. Oxygen in
the gas jet reacts with iron in steel to produce iron oxides. The chemical reaction produces heat that
speeds up the cutting process. It also produces a liquid that is oxidized and has a lower melting point than
steel. The oxidized liquid does not adhere well to the walls of solid steel, and is therefore blown away by
the oxygen gas jet. This produces a dross-free cut edge.
Thermal stress cracking is primarily suitable for brittle materials that are particularly sensitive to
thermal fracture. The focused laser beam causes localized heating of the surface, producing thermal
expansion. This leads to the formation of a crack that can be guided by moving the laser beam across the
surface. Glass is cut using this technique.
Scribing is commonly used for cutting silicon wafers into chips and for cutting thin sheets of ceramics
such as alumina used to produce microelectronic substrates. Scribing involves drilling lines of small
blind holes. Pulsed Nd:YAG lasers are generally used for this purpose, with each laser pulse producing a
hole. The lines of holes allow cutting of the work piece along the lines by snap action. The technique
achieves a cutting speed that is an order of magnitude faster than full-penetration cutting, which may
be needed if curved shapes rather than rectangles are to be cut. In scribing, cutting speeds of 20 m min1
are common.
11.3.4
Machine Conﬁgurations
Based on the mechanism of moving the laser beam across the surface of the work piece to produce the
desired cut, laser cutting machines are categorized as:
1. moving-platform-bed machine conﬁguration
2. ﬂying optics conﬁguration
3. hybrid conﬁguration.
For a moving-platform-bed machine conﬁguration, the laser cutting edge is stationary and the
material is moved under it in the x–y direction to produce the cut. This machine conﬁguration is
characterized by a constant laser-head–work-piece distance, single point removal of cutting efﬂuent and
relatively simple beam delivery optics. The disadvantages include a cutting speed which is the slowest of
the three conﬁgurations and machine dynamics being affected by the variations in the size of the work
piece. Figure 11.2 shows one such laser cutting machine from M/s Coherent Inc. The META E-series
388
Lasers and Optoelectronics

machine is interfaceable with 150 W, 400 W and 1000 W average power pulsed CO2 lasers. When
interfaced with a 1000 W laser, the machine is capable of cutting material thicknesses of 3 mm for
aluminium and stainless steel, 10 mm for mild steel and 25 mm of acrylic, plastics and wood products.
The machine offers 1.25 m  1.25 m of cutting area and a deep moving platform bed with 300 mm of
vertical travel.
For a ﬂying optics conﬁguration, the laser head moves in the x–y direction. The work piece is
stationary. This machine conﬁguration is characterized by high-speed cutting (the highest of the three
conﬁgurations). Since the moving mass (i.e. the laser head) is constant, equipment dynamics are not
affected by a variation in the size of the work piece. Additionally, the work piece need not be clamped.
There is however a changing beam path length due to the movement of the laser head, which can be taken
into account by the use of suitable optics. Figure 11.3 depicts a laser cutting machine of Omni-Beam
series from Coherent Inc. The machine features a high peak power CO2 laser, a cutting area of
1.23 m  1.23 m and a ﬂying optics beam delivery. The machine is primarily used for cutting a wide
range of plastics and organics as well as metals; it can cut non-metallic materials of thickness up
to 25 mm.
A hybrid conﬁguration is a combination of the two above-mentioned conﬁgurations. In this case, the
table housing the work piece is moved in one horizontal direction, usually the x-direction, and the laser
cutting head is moved in the shorter y-axis direction. This conﬁguration boasts the advantages of both the
moving platform bed and ﬂying optics conﬁgurations, and is characterized by simpler beam delivery

optics and higher capacity per watt (due to lower associated loss) compared to the ﬂying optics
conﬁguration.
11.4
Laser Welding
Laser welding is extensively used for both spot and seam welding of a wide range of materials including
metals, alloys and non-metals. Laser welding is particularly attractive in high-volume applications such
as the electronics and automotive industries. Due to a small heat-affected zone and minimal heat input,
laser welding is also distinctively advantageous when it comes to welding thin sections or welding near
sensitive areas such as electronics or glass-to-metal seals. The only disadvantage preventing it from
being more widely used is its high investment cost. In the following sections we brieﬂy describe the basic
principles of laser beam welding, the different welding processes, the types of lasers used for welding
and its key advantages.
11.4.1
Laser Welding Processes
A laser beam is focused onto the surface of the work piece to be welded. The concentrated light energy
produces high energy density at the focal spot. The light energy is absorbed by the material and is
converted into heat energy and the work piece begins to melt. The laser beam energy is maintained such
that the resultant temperature rise is below the vaporization temperature of the material of the work piece
(note that vaporization temperature must be attained in cutting and drilling operations). As the laser
energy is terminated, the common melt re-solidiﬁes producing a spot welded joint. Laser welding is a
type of fusion welding that can be used to produce selective spot welds or linear continuous seam welds.
There are two types of laser welding processes in use: heat conduction and deep penetration.
In the case of heat conduction welding, the materials to be joined are melted by absorption of laser
energy at the material surface and the solidiﬁed melt joins the materials. Welding depths in this case are
typically less than 2 mm. The laser beam is focused onto a speciﬁed location on the material surface. The
heat energy produced as a result of absorbed laser energy conducts to the joint area to be welded by virtue
of close proximity. The two materials change state from solid phase to liquid phase producing a common
melt. When the laser energy is terminated, the common melt is re-solidiﬁed producing a spot welded
joint at that location. Laser conduction welding is mainly used for spot welding, continuous and partial
seam welding.
The deep penetration welding process dominates for power densities of 106 W cm2 or higher. Higher
power density causes localized heating to raise the temperature to the vaporization temperature creating,
a vapour capillary inside the material. The capillary diameter is about 1.5 times the diameter of the
focused spot. The capillary moves through the material following the contour to be welded. Capillary
formation is also referred to as the keyholing effect. The equilibrium achieved due to hydrostatic
pressure, vapour pressure in the capillary and surface tension of the melt prevent the capillary from
collapsing. The laser beam is guided deep into the material by multiple reﬂections in the capillary. The
re-solidiﬁcation of melt after the removal of laser energy produces the welded joint. It is possible to
achieve weld depths in excess of 25 mm in steel using deep penetration welding. Figure 11.4a and b
depicts the heat conduction and deep penetration welding processes.
11.4.2
Welding Lasers
Commonly used laser sources for welding applications are CO2 lasers and neodymium-doped lasers
including Nd:YAG and Nd:Glass lasers. Welding by CO2 laser is characterized by an operating
wavelength of 10.6 mm, a beam delivery to the work piece using bulk optics and not ﬁbre optics, a
laser power in the range of a few hundreds of watts to kilowatts and a high-speed operation. Both pulsed
and CW lasers are available for the purpose. CO2 lasers are capable of welding both metallic and non-
metallic materials. The far-infrared wavelength has an initial reﬂectance of 80–90% for most metals.
Because of their higher power level and capillary action, CO2 lasers overcome the limitations due to high
initial reﬂectivity. Once the material surface temperature at the focal point approaches melting point,
390
Lasers and Optoelectronics

reﬂectivity drops within microseconds. With advances in laser technology, fast spiral ﬂow lasers are
available, producing fundamental mode output at the kilowatt level. The higher energy density available
from these lasers makes them suitable for welding thermally sensitive alloys where thermal distortion is
a problem. For applications requiring rapid energy coupling and low heat input, slow axial ﬂow lasers
with enhanced pulse capability are preferred over fast axial ﬂow systems. Higher peak power and lower
average power overcome the surface reﬂectivity problem and minimize damage to the surrounding
material.
Nd:YAG laser welding is characterized by an operating wavelength of 1.064 mm, a beam delivery
by either bulk optics or ﬁbre optics and a typical power level in the range of tens of watts to a few
hundreds of watts. The key advantage of using Nd:YAG laser welding stems from the high
absorptivity of metallic materials, including aluminium and copper, at 1.064 mm wavelength. The
near-infrared wavelength also permits the use of standard optics to achieve focused spot sizes of a few
tenths of a millimetre. Nd:YAG and Nd:Glass lasers are used for low to moderate power applications.
These lasers are preferred in the electronics industry for the fabrication of semiconductor devices and
integrated circuits. Another advantage of Nd:YAG and Nd:Glass laser welding is the coaxial viewing
optics offered by these machines, which is a big advantage in delicate welding applications such as
lamp ﬁlaments. The operating wavelength allows the use of standard optics to transmit laser as well as
image work piece. Nd:YAG laser welding machines are also relatively smaller in size compared to
CO2 laser welding machines.
Figure 11.5 depicts an Nd:YAG laser spot welding machine from M/s Sintec Optronics Pte Ltd. The
major speciﬁcations of the system include maximum average power of 200 W, pulse width and pulse
repetition frequency of less than or equal to 20 ms and 15 Hz respectively and a focused spot
diameter of 0.1–0.3 mm. The machine is capable of spot welding a range of materials including cold-
work alloy steel, hot-work alloy steel, nickel tool steel, high-grade steel and high-tenacity
aluminium alloy.

Advantages
The key advantages of laser welding compared to conventional techniques such as gas metal arc
welding, submerged arc welding, resistance welding and electron beam welding are as follows. Laser
welding:
1. is a non-contact process, which eliminates the problems of tool wear and tear and debris
build-up;
2. can be used for a wide range of materials including metals, alloys and plastics;
3. is easily adapted to automation;
4. is a high-speed operation, faster welding rates and high-quality welding, eliminating the need for
any post-welding processing;
5. has adjustable input energy to best suit different materials;
6. has higher operational safety with proven beam delivery systems;
7. offers the possibility of simultaneous spot welds by using either different machines or the same
machine with beam splitters;
8. has higher reliability and repeatability;
9. is associated with low thermal material inﬂuences;
10. can do single-pass two-side welding;
11. facilitates access to inaccessible locations; and
12. does not require operation in vacuum or magnetic shielding (as for electron beam welding) and can
be used to weld magnetic materials.

Laser Drilling
Laser drilling is a thermal process by which holes are drilled using a tightly focused laser beam to
produce a high energy density at the focal spot. The thermal removal process is by melting and
evaporation and the melt is ejected out by vaporization with or without the assist gas pressure. Laser
drilling has enabled the drilling of small holes with extraordinary precision in different shapes and
orientations in a wide range of materials, including difﬁcult-to-machine aerospace alloys. The drilling of
hundreds and thousands of extremely ﬁne cooling holes in aerospace turbine engine parts at unusual
angles has signiﬁcantly enhanced cooling efﬁciencies, by controlling the magnitude and direction of
ﬂow of cooling ﬂuids. Laser technology is extensively employed in the fabrication of parts of turbine
engines in aircraft and land-based power generation systems, in the automotive industry and in medicine.
11.5.1
Basic Principle
A beam from a high-power laser is focused on the surface of the work piece, producing high power
density in the range of megawatts to hundreds of megawatts per squared centimetre. The light energy is
absorbed and converted to heat energy, leading to a localized increase in temperature. The material melts,
vaporizes and drills into the material thickness. The material is thrown out by a pressure gradient created
by the vaporization pressure, with or without the pressure exerted by an assist gas. In the melt expulsion
without an assist gas, expulsion is the result of a rapid build-up of gas pressure created by vaporization
within a cavity. For melt expulsion due to vaporization pressure alone, there must be a molten layer and
the pressure gradient acting on the surface must be sufﬁciently large to overcome the force due to surface
tension. Vaporization pressure is a strong function of peak temperature. The desired pressure gradient
occurs only for a temperature greater than a certain critical temperature at which gas pressure and the
surface tension of molten material are equal. Figure 11.6 illustrates the laser drilling operation.

11.5.2
Laser Drilling Processes
Commonly used drilling processes include: single-pulse drilling; percussion drilling and its variants;
trepanning and its variants; and imaged drilling.
Single-pulse drilling uses a single pulse to drill each hole as shown in Figure 11.7 a, and is used for
high-speed drilling blind and through holes. The process is commonly used in the automotive industry
to create a scribed guideline for breaking off a connecting rod in diesel engines, by drilling blind holes
close enough to produce a notch. Another example from the automotive industry is the manufacture
of ﬁlters.
Percussion drilling, illustrated in Figure 11.7b, is used to drill holes with diameters in the range
20–1200 mm. The aspect ratio (deﬁned by the ratio of depth to diameter of the hole) can be as high as
200:1. Percussion drilling can be accomplished with or without an assist gas. If no assist gas is used for
the expulsion of the molten material, an alternative method for the protection of the focusing optics needs
to be employed. In percussion drilling operation, both laser and work piece are usually stationary. More
than one laser pulse is required to drill each hole, with the number of pulses depending upon the material
thickness. Percussion drilling is a relatively slow process however, and this limitation is overcome by

(d)

Lasers and Optoelectronics

parallel percussion drilling. In this case, the laser beam is split into an array of smaller beams which
allows the simultaneous drilling of holes (typically, 100 holes may be drilled simultaneously). The
drilling rate either approaches or exceeds the rate achievable by percussion drilling-on-the-ﬂy (also
called single-pulse serial drilling) without compromising the quality of the percussion drilling.
In drilling-on-the-ﬂy operation, a stationary laser beam and a moving work piece conﬁguration is
employed. Air or an inert gas may be used as an assist gas. Oxygen is also used in what is referred to as
exothermal percussion drilling. Oxygen causes an exothermic reaction with many metals, and the
consequent rise in temperature helps in efﬁcient removal of molten material.
Trepanning is used when the laser beam diameter is much smaller than the diameter of the hole to
be drilled. It is also used to cut features other than drilling circular holes. Note that the term ‘drilling’ refers
to operations where the diameter of the hole or cut feature is less than or equal to the thickness of
the material. The trepanning process employs a moving laser beam from a rotating optical head
with or without a moving work piece, as shown in Figure 11.7c. The availability of high-precision and
repeatablelaserpositioningsystemshasmademanyuniqueandtight-tolerancetrepannedfeaturespossible.
Shaped-hole drilling is an emerging variation of the trepanning process. It has enabled designers to try new
cooling system designs for turbine components of aerospace engines and land-based power generation
systems.
A variation of trepanning process is helical trepanning. The process is essentially trepanning
combined with percussion drilling. In this process, the laser beam is rotated around the circumference
of the hole many times until full penetration is obtained (Figure 11.7d). This leads to a signiﬁcant
improvement in the quality achieved from drill-on-the-ﬂy processes. However, it necessitates the use of a
very high-repetition-rate copper vapour laser.
Imaged drilling is a highly specialized method producing high-quality drilling. In this, an image of a
mask is projected onto the surface of the work piece. Percussion drilling is then used to drill holes, with
the hole shape being exactly that of the mask. It requires short-pulse lasers with uniform beam proﬁle. It
is generally used for drilling a small number of highly accurate holes. Figure 11.8 illustrates imaged
drilling process.
11.5.3
Lasers for Drilling
Commonly used lasers for drilling operation are the Nd:YAG lasers and CO2 lasers. Pulsed Nd:YAG
lasers are far more popular than CO2 lasers for drilling operation. Both free-running output and
Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers are used for the purpose. Free-running lasers produce pulse widths of
hundreds of microseconds to a millisecond and power density up to the megawatt per squared
centimetre level. In contrast, Q-switched lasers used for drilling produce pulse widths of a few
nanoseconds to a few tens of nanoseconds and a power density in the range of tens to hundreds of
megawatts per squared centimetre.
Power density achieved at the work piece depends on both power level and focused spot diameter;
focusing optics therefore plays an important part. The focused spot diameter is also correlated to the hole

diameter. For thin materials with thickness less than or equal to 6 mm, focused spot diameter is generally
the same as the hole diameter. Focal spot position is also kept slightly above or below the material surface
to achieve best results. In most cases, focal spot is below the surface by a length equal to 5–15% of the
material thickness.
Pulse repetition frequency is determined on the basis of required throughput and quality: 5–200 Hz in
the case of percussion drilling with Nd:YAG lasers, and up to 1 kHz with CO2 lasers. CO2 lasers are used
for non-metallic materials.
11.5.4
Advantages of Laser Drilling
There are many advantages of laser drilling as listed below. Laser drilling:
1. is a non-contact process free from the problems of tool wear and tear associated with conventional
drilling techniques;
2. has a small heat-affected zone and can be used on a wide range of materials including alloy steels,
precious metals, non-ferrous materials, tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, nickel, beryllium, alumin-
ium, silicon and non-metallic materials;
3. enables drilling in difﬁcult-to-drill materials including super alloys, composites and ceramics;
4. is capable of much higher drilling rates than conventional mechanical drilling;
5. allows operation at high angles, which is extremely difﬁcult with conventional mechanical drilling;
6. is particularly suited for drilling operations in non-conductive substrates or metallic substrates coated
with non-conducting materials where electric discharge machining poses substantial problems; it is
also suited to drilling in the thermal-barrier-coated superalloys and multilayer carbon-ﬁbre compo-
sites used in aerospace applications;
7. works very well for drilling high aspect ratios at shallow angles to the surface;
8. adapts very well to real-time characterization during drilling operations.
11.6
Laser Marking and Engraving
Laser marking is a surface process; the laser beam is focused on the work piece and laser energy is
converted into heat energy. This causes an instantaneous rise in temperature over a time period which
is much shorter than the thermal conductive time constant of the material. Laser marking is a non-
contact process, unlike other marking techniques that either use ink or bit heads. Laser marking is
extensively used in a variety of applications such as: adding part numbers, manufacturing and expiry
dates on food packages and medicines; adding traceable information for quality control; printing bar
codes, logos and other information on products; and marking PCBs and electronic components and
modules. Laser marking is used on a wide variety of materials including metals, acrylic, paper,
wood, cardboard, plastic materials and leather. Figure 11.9 shows some laser marked/engraved
samples.
11.6.1
Principle of Operation
The laser beam from a pulsed laser source is focused on the surface of the work piece to be marked. The
laser beam modiﬁes the optical appearance of the surface at the point where the laser beam hits the
surface. The modiﬁcation of optical appearance occurs as a result of the following processes: material
ablation (also referred to as engraving), which removes a coloured surface layer; melting, which
modiﬁes the surface structure; slight burning (also called carbonization), usually employed on paper,
wood, cardboard or polymers; transformation or bleaching of pigments in plastics; expansion of a
polymer and generation of surface structures such as small bubbles. The laser beam is then scanned using
a vector scan or raster scan to mark the object in two dimensions. An alternative approach is to use a mask
that is imaged onto the work piece. The process is known as mask marking or projection marking.
Although less ﬂexible than scanning process, mask marking is much faster and can even be used on
moving objects.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

11.6.2
Laser Marking Processes
Commonly used laser marking processes include: laser bonding; laser engraving/vaporization; laser
etching/melting; laser ablation; laser coating and marking; laser coloration/annealing; laser engraving
and melting; and 3D engraving.
In the laser bonding process, pigments and other materials applied to the material surface are bonded
by the heat energy generated by the absorption of laser energy. Marking by laser bonding is resistant to
heat and is unaffected by ﬂuids and salt. It is particularly attractive for safety-critical parts.
In laser engraving, heat energy generated by absorption of laser energy causes the material to
vaporize, leaving a mark with very little damage to the material itself. It is not preferred for safety-
critical parts.
Figure 11.9
Laser engraved samples.
Lasers in Industry
397

In laser etching, the heat energy causes the material surface to melt rather than vaporize. The melted
material expands, producing a raised mark. The laser etching process however changes the surface ﬁnish.
Also, penetration depth is limited to 2–3 mm. Its key advantage is its speed.
In the laser ablation process, a coated material surface is engraved. The technique works well with
coatings and paints and other surface treatments. It produces excellent contrast without affecting the
underlying material. This technique is popular for marking anodized aluminium and painted steels.
In laser coating and marking, the material surface is ﬁrst coated and etched. Laser colouration uses a
low-power laser beam moving across the surface, discolouring the material in the process to leave behind
high-contrast marks. It is also called charring in plastics and annealing in metals.
Engraving and melting is characterized by material removal and surface melt. 3D engraving creates
very high-quality 3D marks at signiﬁcant depths.
The efﬁcacy of the above-mentioned laser marking techniques depends on one or more of the physical
properties of the material to be marked. The colour of the material marginally affects the absorption of
laser energy, although dark colours absorb slightly more than lighter colours. Painted colours have little
effect, as the paint is usually vaporized away by laser energy.
The surface ﬁnish has a signiﬁcant bearing on the contrast of laser mark. A smooth surface produces
excellent readability even with shallow engraving. On the other hand, a rough surface requires deeper
engraving forgoodcontrast(assumingthat thelaserdoesnotinduce acolourchange). Reﬂectivityshouldbe
small, as laser energy needs to be absorbed for marking. Higher reﬂectivity materials require larger laser
power. Variation of absorptivity as a function of temperature is another parameter that affects performance.
While on one hand it may force the material to go to runaway condition, a reduced power may not be able to
achieve the desired initial temperature rise. High thermal conductivity is also undesirable as it tends to
conduct heat energy away from the point where the temperature is required to rise in order to leave a mark.
For all practical purposes, material hardness does not affect marking efﬁcacy.
11.6.3
Lasers for Marking and Engraving
Commonly used lasers for marking applications include ﬂash- and diode-pumped pulsed Nd:YAG lasers
operating at 1.064 mm and their harmonics at 532 nm, 355 nm and 266 nm; ytterbium-doped pulsed ﬁbre
lasers operating at 1.07 mm; pulsed CO2 lasers operating at 10.6 mm; and excimer lasers operating in the
ultraviolet wavelength band. CO2 lasers are less suitable for marking metals due to the small absorptivity
of metals at the CO2 laser operating wavelength of 10.6 mm. CO2 lasers can be used to mark all materials
except metals and are widely used to mark electronic components and packaged goods using both
imaged mask (Figure 11.10) and dot matrix formats. They are also used to mark anodized aluminium and
other materials that show good absorption at larger wavelengths, and in applications demanding higher
average power laser.
Nd:YAG and ﬁbrelasers are morepopular for marking duetothe strong absorption characteristicsof most
materials at 1.0mm. For precious metals suchas gold, which exhibits low absorption at 1.0mm, a frequency-
doubled Nd:YAG laser emitting at 532 nm is used. Q-switched Nd:YVO4 lasers may be used where a high
repetition rate of greater than 100 kHz is required. Figure 11.11 depicts a laser marking station, Model No.
LWS 780 from M/s Trotec Laser Inc. Depending upon the intended application, the marker station is
conﬁgurable with both the CO2- as well as the ﬁbre-laser-based marking heads of the SpeedMarker series
from the same company. The two types oflasermarking heads are shown inFigure11.12 . The lasermarking
station can be used for marking components in machine and tool construction, in medicine and in the
electronics industry. State-of-the-art laser marking machines are usually equipped with the required
hardware and software to automate all operations of the machine. Typically, the design to be marked or
engraved may be stored in the computer that controls all operations to mark the design on the object.
Excimer lasers such as KrF lasers emitting at 248 nm are used in a few niche areas where a UV
wavelength is necessary to make a mark. They are generally used for marking part numbers on small
ceramic chip capacitors, medical catheters and ﬂuoropolymer-coated aircraft wire by virtue of titanium
dioxide additives using imaged mask technique. KrF lasers are used to inscribe gratings inside doped
optical ﬁbres. In this case, UV light is imaged inside the ﬁbre using a diffractive mask.

Advantages
Laser marking and engraving offer a large number of advantages over conventional marking and
engraving techniques, as listed below:
1. Conventional marking/engraving employs toxic chemicals, leaving behind a chemical residue. In
laser engraving, no toxic chemicals are used and there is no chemical residue left after engraving.
2. Laser marking is a non-contact and a quiet process and there is no requirement for any special
environment.
3. Since the laser marking machine has no direct contact with the surface of the material to be marked or
engraved, it is easier to adapt to uneven surfaces.
4. In conventional engraving, tool tips need to be replaced depending upon the type of surface to be
marked or engraved. There is no such associated problem in case of laser marking.
5. Laser marking produces high-quality permanent marks at low operational cost.
6. Laser marking is effective even on difﬁcult-to-access areas and adapts very well to automation.
7. Due to precise beam positioning and localized energy transfer, the heat-affected zone is very small;
this practically eliminates any damage to adjacent areas.
8. Laser marking is characterized by high reproducibility, high speed and high throughput.
9. Laser marking can be used effectively on a wide variety of metallic and non-metallic materials of
various sizes, shapes and orientations.

Laser Micromachining
Laser micromachining is an established technology for high-precision microfabrication. It is a very
powerful technique that allows new device designs to be realized and evaluated quickly, perhaps in a
matter of days, in a cost-effective manner. Most industrial applications are centred on the processes of
material ablation and melting, which includes cutting, drilling, welding and marking. It is the ability of
the ultrafast lasers to etch out extremely small features on a micrometer scale that has spurred on the
development in micromachining. Mechanical micromachining processes mainly include microcutting,
microdrilling, microwelding, microturning and micromilling.
Figure 11.13 depicts some micromachined samples, covering a variety of applications. The samples
shown in Figure 11.13 include a micromachined blackbody emitter (Figure 11.13a), a microlens array

(Figure 11.13b), a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) accelerometer (Figure 11.13c), a
stent (Figure 11.13d), a wire mesh for RFI shielding application (Figure 11.13e) and a laser-cut stencil
(Figure 11.13f).
Micromachining processes can be applied to a wide range of materials. These include metals such as
aluminium, steel and stainless steel, molybdenum, copper, titanium, platinum, gold, silver, nickel,
tantalum, chromium and tungsten; semiconductors such as silicon, germanium, gallium arsenide and
gallium nitride; ceramics such as alumina, bulk and thin-ﬁlm silicon nitrides, silicon carbide, lithium
niobate, zirconium and metalized ceramics; dielectrics such as glasses, borosilicate, soda lime, sapphire,
silicon dioxide, synthetic diamond and ﬁbres; polymers such as polyester, polyethylene, polyamides,
polyimides, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyurethanes, silicone resin, epoxy resins and elastomers; and
other materials such as sol-gel, carbon composites and bio-materials such as cornea and protein.
Micromachining processes ﬁnd extensive application in the automotive, space, biomedical, electronics
and micromechanics industries.
11.7.1
Laser Micromachining Operations
Common micromachining operations include microdrilling, microcutting, micromilling, microwelding,
marking and engraving, scribing and dicing. Laser microdrilling can be used to produce microholes of
pinholes, nozzles, oriﬁces, vias and photovoltaic cells in a wide variety of materials. With the available
technology, position and diameter tolerances of sub-micron level can be achieved. Available micro-
drilling techniques, coupled with an appropriate laser for the job, can be used to drill microholes in a
wide range of components and devices including fuel injection components, inkjet printer nozzles, ﬁbre-
optic interconnects, vertical probe cards, metred dose inhaler products, pin holes and slits for scientiﬁc
instrumentation, sensors, fuel cells and medical devices with a very high diameter accuracy and
controlled taper.
Laser microcutting is an attractive micromachining technique for most materials, which includes
metals (e.g. stainless steel, hardened steel, copper, aluminium, tungsten, brass and titanium); ceramics
(e.g. alumina, silicon nitride, tungsten carbide, PZT and zirconium); glasses and crystalline materials
(namely BK7, fused silica and sapphire); hard materials (e.g. diamond); and plastics (e.g. polyimide,
PTFE, PMMA and ABS). Laser microcutting allows features as small as <1.0 mm wide and 2 mm deep
to be machined.
Laser micromilling is ideal for a wide variety of applications including the production of micromoulds
and microstamping tools and the creation of microﬂuidic devices. Laser micromilling is simple in
concept. Each laser pulse ablates a very small amount of material. The laser is scanned across the surface
to produce the desired feature. The number of pulses at each position determines the depth of the feature.
In practice, the quality of the result is strongly dependent on the choice of laser and the scanning strategy
adopted. In many cases the morphology of the starting material is also important, with ﬁne-grained or
amorphous materials producing the best results.
Laser micro-engraving and micromarking is a subset of laser micromilling. These processes are used
to engrave patterns and shapes on different materials. In micro-engraving and marking operations, a
laser beam is scanned over the surface of the material and small amount of material is removed by each
laser pulse. The depth of the mark is usually controlled by the number of laser pulses at each point.
Common applications of micro-engraving and micromarking include surface microtexturing, decora-
tive engraving and 2D bar codes. State-of-the-art micro-engraving and micromarking machines can
engrave microfeatures down to submicron level. MicroStar from M/s Ohio Gravure Technologies Inc
(Figure 11.14) is one such laser micro-engraving machine.
Laser microscribing can be used to scribe ﬁne features in many materials including metals, ceramics
and glasses. It is commonly used as the ﬁrst step before dicing. The scribing process weakens the
material in a controlled manner before a force is applied to fracture it. It is commonly used in the
electronics industry for dicing silicon wafers and ceramic sheets and also in the solar power industry for
cutting photovoltaic cells for solar concentrators.

11.7.2
Lasers for Micromachining
The most commonly used laser types for micromachining applications include diode-pumped solid-state
lasers, ﬁbre lasers and excimer gas lasers producing pulsed outputs. Although pulsed-output CO2 lasers
are also widely used for cutting applications, particularly for cutting plastic materials, they have
limitations in the materials they can machine and the precision of micromachining features they are
capable of producing.
Micromachining lasers are almost exclusively pulsed-output lasers as they provide better control of
heat input than continuous wave output lasers, which can easily melt small features. Also, the ability to
adjust pulse characteristics such as pulse repetition frequency and pulse energy provides process
ﬂexibility. It may be mentioned here that shorter wavelengths are key to the production of small feature
sizes. Commonly used solid-state lasers include diode-pumped Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers operating at
1064 nm (near IR) and their harmonics at 532 nm (visible), 355 nm (near UV) and 266 nm (UV). A
commonly used ﬁbre laser is a pulsed Yb-doped ﬁbre laser operating at 1070 nm. Excimer lasers operate
in the UV region; commonly used excimer lasers include ArF lasers operating at 193 nm, KrF lasers
operating at 248 nm, XeCl lasers operating at 308 nm and XeF lasers operating at 351 nm. There exists a
wide choice of operating wavelengths from the UV to near-IR region.
When choosing an appropriate laser for a given micromachining application, factors such as the nature
of job to be performed (e.g. whether surface modiﬁcation or ablation), whether 2D or 3D, resolution in
terms of required minimum feature sizes, area of the sample to be worked upon, material characteristics,
process scalability, desired processing speed and operational costs all need to be considered. The nature
of the job determines the processing approach to be adopted. Resolution determines laser wavelength,
processing technique and optical system. Material absorption characteristics dictate the operational
wavelength. For example, ultraviolet wavelength band is preferred for micromachining silicon as silicon
absorbs ultraviolet wavelengths better than visible and infrared wavelengths. Laser matter interaction is
also inﬂuenced by pulse width and energy density, also called ﬂuence. Although there may be more than
one type of laser broadly meeting the application requirements, there is always an optimum choice
of laser.
The majority of lasers intended for micromachining applications have pulse energy in the range
1–500 mJ, pulse width of 10 ns–10 ms, pulse repetition frequency in the range 10 Hz–500 kHz and
average power of 1.0–100 W. If the intended micromachining operation relates to the fabrication of a
medical laser, it is important to consider regulatory requirements before ﬁnalizing a particular laser for a
micromachining application.

11.7.3
Laser Micromachining Techniques
There are two broad categories of laser micromachining techniques: beam focusing (also called direct
writing) and mask projection. In the case of the former, the laser beam is scanned across the work piece
by moving either the work piece or the laser beam or a combination of the two. In the case of the latter,
the laser beam illuminates a mask which is then imaged or projected onto the work piece to perform the
desired micromachining operation. The two techniques are brieﬂy described in the following.
Inthecase ofthe beam-focusing (or direct-writing) technique,thelaserbeam istightlyfocusedtoa small
spotontheworkpieceandthen scannedacrossittoperformthedesiredmachiningoperation.Thefocalspot
diameter here deﬁnes the smallest feature dimension. Figure 11.15 depicts the direct-writing laser
micromachining system. In view of the requirement of a small focal spot in the direct-writing technique,
the lasers capable of producing high beam quality output with M2 <1.3 are generally used. Focal spot sizes
in the range 5–10 mm are common. Commonly used lasers for this technique include solid-state lasers such
as Nd:YAG, Nd:YVO4 and Ti:Sapphire lasers and single-mode RF-excited CO2 lasers.
There are three system variants of this technique. These include: (a) ﬁxed laser beam position and
work piece on CNC-controlled x–y stages; (b) static work piece and CNC-controlled galvanometer
scanner mirrors to steer the laser beam; and (c) a combination of (a) and (b). Figure 11.15 represents
system (a). In the case of beam scanning system (b), the laser beam is rapidly scanned over a small area
on the work piece by galvanometer x–y scanning mirrors. Desired features are produced by suitably
controlling the scanning mirrors with the help of CAD data ﬁles. Figure 11.16 shows the schematic
representation of beam scanning system. Flat ﬁeld lenses are used for focusing to ensure that the laser
beam maintains a good beam focus while scanning over the area. Scan ﬁeld sizes of several tens of
millimetres are commonly available.
The third type of micromachining system (c) uses a combination of galvanometer scanning mirrors for
laser beam steering and x–y stages for motion of the work piece. This technique combines the advantages
of ultra-high-speed processing of beam scanning and the ability to process large dimensions of greater
than 200 mm in the case of direct writing. In the case of beam scanning, the processing dimensions are
limited to less than 50 mm by the size of the ﬂat ﬁeld image size. This allows large samples to be
processed at high speed. This technique is usually used when it is feasible to stitch together the separate
scan ﬁelds. One such example is processing of PCBs, where individual hole positions can be easily
deﬁned in each scan ﬁeld. State-of-the art systems allow use of this technique even for continuous
micromachining without it being constrained by the existence of discrete scan ﬁelds.

Key advantages of the direct-writing micromachining technique include large wavelength coverage
from visible to long-infrared, high repetition rates from tens to hundreds of kilohertz, different pulse
widths from a few nanoseconds to a few microseconds, high resolution and low operational costs. The
variability of laser parameters gives process ﬂexibility to this technique.
The mask-projection technique is almost invariably used in all micromachining applications
demanding the use of multimode excimer lasers to achieve ultra-high feature resolution. The multimode
nature of the excimer laser output lends itself very well to the mask-projection technique. Since the
multimode output cannot be tightly focused, the excimer laser is not a feasible option for micro-
machining by the direct-writing technique. Key attributes of the mask-projection excimer laser include
high feature resolution, ﬁne depth control, excellent reproducibility and large sample areas.
Figure 11.17 illustrates the basic concept of the mask-projection technique. The laser beam from the
excimer laser is shaped using an expansion telescope and then homogenized with the help of a single or
double ﬂy’s eye lens array. The purpose of the homogenizer is to produce a laser beam with uniform
energy density distribution illuminating the mask. The plane of uniformity of the beam is made
coincident with the plane of positioning of the mask. The pattern on the mask is imaged or projected onto
the work piece.

Two types of mask-projection techniques are in common use: standard mask-projection technique
and synchronized overlay scanning technique. In standard mask-projection systems, while feature
resolution is determined by the mask and optical projection system, the depth of the microstructures is
controlled by the number of laser pulses ﬁred at a given location. The entire sample area is usually
machined under the same laser conditions, which means that all microstructures are machined to the
same depth. Although uniformity of depth of different microstructures may be important in most
applications, there are many emerging applications demanding tailoring of depth proﬁle of the micro-
structures across the sample size. Some of these applications include printing devices, multifunctional

units using micro-optical-electromechanical systems (MOEMS) and microﬂuidic systems. Although the
standard mask-projection technique is capable of producing the desired depth proﬁles by appropriately
synchronizing sample position and laser ﬁring sequence, the level of depth proﬁle control needed in
many complex jobs of the type outlined above may not be optimally achieved.
The synchronized overlay scanning (SOS) mask-projection technique offers a solution to the
limitations of the standard mask-projection technique. For the SOS technique, the mask and work
piece are moved in unison in the same manner as for the standard mask-projection approach. In addition,
an aperture is used above the mask to additionally shape the beam. The shape of the aperture determines
the shape of the beam and hence the depth proﬁle of microstructures. Figure 11.18 illustrates the SOS
concept. In the diagram shown, the aperture gives a triagular shape to the beam, resulting in a triangular
depth proﬁle. The feature-determining mask can be chosen independent of the aperture shape that
determines depth proﬁle. An appropriate combination of mask and aperture can therefore be used to meet
the speciﬁc requirements of the intended application.
11.8
Photolithography
Photolithography is a type of microfabrication process that uses light to transfer a geometric pattern
on a photomask to a light-sensitive material called a photoresist on a part of thin ﬁlm or bulk substrate.
The photoresist material is then developed in a developer solution to form resist patterns. The
principle is somewhat similar to that of photography. Photolithography is extensively used in the

semiconductor industry for fabrication of complex integrated circuits, in particular the ultra-large-
scale integrated circuits (ULSI). In contrast to the photolithography systems of the early 1960s to mid-
1980s which employed gas-discharge lamps ﬁlled with mercury or a combination of mercury and
xenon as the source of ultraviolet light, modern systems use ultraviolet output from excimer lasers
such as KrF and ArF lasers. Photolithography can create extremely small feature sizes down to a few
tens of a nanometre, can exercise precise control over the size and the shape of features created and is
cost effective when used to create patterns over an entire surface. However, it requires extremely clean
conditions and a ﬂat substrate.
11.8.1
Basic Process
The various steps involved in one iteration of photolithography include:
1. wafer cleaning;
2. barrier layer formation;
3. photoresist application;
4. soft baking;
5. mask alignment;
6. exposure to UV light and development; and
7. hard baking.
Figure 11.19 illustrates the different steps involved in the photolithography process. In the ﬁrst step,
the wafer is cleaned by wet chemical treatment using, for example, solutions containing hydrogen
peroxide to remove any organic or inorganic impurities contaminating the wafer surface. The next step is
to deposit a silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer on the surface of the wafer.
After wafer cleaning and barrier layer formation, a thin uniform coating of photoresist of thickness
0.5–2.5 mm is applied to the surface of the wafer. The spin-coating process is used to dispense a viscous
liquid solution of the photoresist onto the wafer by spinning it at 1200–4800 rpm for a period of 30–60 s.
The resulting photoresist layer has a uniformity of better than 10 mm. When exposed to ultraviolet light,
the photoresist coating material undergoes a change in its chemical structure and becomes either soluble
in a developer solution or is polymerized and becomes very difﬁcult to dissolve.
There are two types of photoresist: positive and negative. A positive photoresist is used whenever the
parts of it exposed to ultraviolet light are to be removed. If a negative photoresist is used, the developer
solution removes the unexposed parts and the exposed portion remains on the surface. Positive
photoresists are more widely used than negative photoresists as they offer relatively better process
control for small feature sizes; positive photoresists are therefore the dominant type in the fabrication of
very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) and ULSI circuit chips. Figure 11.19a and b depicts the sequence of
steps involved in the photolithography process for both positive and negative photoresists, respectively.
The photoresist-coated wafer is then pre-baked (also referred to as soft baked), typically at 90–100 C
for 30–60 s to drive off the excess photoresist solvent. The photoresist coating only achieves its
photosensitive property after soft baking. Over-soft-baking can degrade the photosensitivity of the
photoresist by either reducing developer solubility or destroying a portion of the sensitizer. On the other
hand, under-baking can prevent light from reaching the sensitizer.
Mask alignment follows the soft-baking process. A photomask is basically a square glass plate with a
patterned emulsion of a metal ﬁlm on one side. The geometric pattern is transferred onto the wafer
surface for subsequent selective etching. The mask is aligned to the wafer. Note that the masking
operation is usually carried out several times to complete the entire photolithography process. Each mask
after the ﬁrst must be aligned with respect to the previous pattern.
The next step after mask alignment is exposure of the wafer to intense ultraviolet radiation through the
patterned mask. Commonly employed methods of exposure are contact printing, proximity exposure and
projection printing. In contact printing, the wafer with the photoresist layer is in physical contact with the
photomask during its exposure to ultraviolet light. Contact printing is characterized by very high

resolution. Typically, it is possible to achieve feature sizes of 1 mm in a 0.5 mm positive photoresist layer.
The disadvantage is that the debris trapped between the photoresist and mask may damage the mask and
produce defects in the pattern. Figure 11.20a shows the schematic arrangement in the case of contact
printing.
The proximity method is similar to contact printing except that a small gap of 10–25 mm is maintained
between the wafer and the mask. This largely overcomes the disadvantage of contact printing by
minimizing mask damage, but only at the cost of reduced resolution. The resolution in this case is of the
order 2–4 mm. Figure 11.20b shows the schematic arrangement for the proximity method.
In projection printing, wafer is centimetres away from the mask and only a small portion of the mask is
imaged onto the wafer at a time. This small image ﬁeld is the scanned over the surface of wafer.
Projection printing completely overcomes the problem of mask damage, and its small image ﬁeld means
that a high resolution of the order 1 mm is achievable. Figure 11.20c depicts the schematic arrangement
in the case of projection printing. While using the projection method with a negative photoresist, for
exposure energy less than a certain threshold level the resist remains completely soluble in developer
solution. It is only when the exposure energy is 2–3 times the threshold level that the photoresist remains
mostly undissolved in the developer solution. In the case of a positive photoresist, the resist has some
ﬁnite solubility even at zero exposure energy. Solubility increases with an increase in exposure energy
until it becomes fully soluble at a certain exposure energy. The minimum feature size that a projection
system can achieve is calculated from Equation 11.1:
Minimum feature size ¼ k1l
NA
(11.1)
where l is wavelength, k1 is a coefﬁcient dependent upon process parameters (typically 0.4) and NA is
numerical aperture of the projection lens as seen from the wafer.
Hard baking is the last step in the photolithography process. The wafer is hard baked at 120–180 C
for a period of 20–30 min. It solidiﬁes the remaining photoresist and improves its adhesion to the wafer
surface, which helps in subsequent operations of etching or ion implantation.

Depth of focus is another important requirement, which is calculated from Equation 11.2:
Depth of focus ¼ k2l
NA2
(11.2)
where k2 is another process-related coefﬁcient.
As is evident from Equations 11.1 and 11.2, the two parameters of minimum feature size and depth of
focus compete against each other. For a given minimum feature size requirement, depth of focus restricts
the thickness of the photoresist and also the depth of topography on the wafer.
11.8.2
Lasers for Photolithography
During the 1960s–mid-1980s, photolithography equipment included gas-discharge lamps ﬁlled with
either mercury or a combination of mercury and a noble gas such as xenon as the source of ultraviolet
radiation. The usually broadband radiation from these lamps has some strong peaks in the ultraviolet
band, which can be ﬁltered to produce a single line. Spectral lines from mercury lamps include the g-line
at 436 nm, h-line at 405 nm and i-line at 365 nm. In the mid-1980s, mercury-lamp-based lithography
equipment began to be replaced by excimer-laser-based equipment. The use of excimer lasers
signiﬁcantly enhanced resolution to produce faster and denser chips by operation at lower ultraviolet
wavelengths, and reduced operational costs by increased throughput. Excimer laser lithography has
enabled feature sizes as small as 25 nm to be achieved, which is expected to approach 10 nm by 2020.
Commonly used excimer lasers for lithography equipment include ArF and KrF lasers emitting at
193 nm and 248 nm, respectively. The F2 excimer laser emitting at 157 nm was previously considered to
achieve higher resolution than that from ArF and KrF lasers. Due to persistent problems with 157 nm
technology and also economic considerations, the industry has continued with the better-established
193 nm KrF laser lithography for high-resolution requirement. The introduction of immersion lithogra-
phy has also enabled higher-resolution performance due to increased numerical aperture. Note that the
minimum achievable feature dimension is directly proportional to operating wavelength and inversely
proportional to numerical aperture. In immersion lithography, the usual air gap between the projection
lens and the wafer is replaced by a higher-refractive-index liquid, enabling the use of optics with a
numerical aperture exceeding 1.0. Use of immersion lithography with the 193 nm KrF laser has replaced
the 157 nm F2 laser lithography equipment for higher-resolution requirements.

wavelength. Materials for photoresists and optics are available in the case of ArF, KrF and F2 lasers.
Figure 11.21 illustrates the excimer laser IndyStar from Coherent Inc., suited to photolithography
applications. The IndyStar is available in four variants: two are ArF lasers emitting at 193 nm with a
stabilized output pulse energy of 8 mJ at 1 kHz and 4 mJ at 2 kHz; the other two are KrF lasers emitting at
248 nm with stabilized output energy of 12 mJ at 1 kHz and 6 mJ at 2 kHz.
11.9
Rapid Manufacturing
Rapid manufacturing is a collection of technologies developed to shorten the design and production
cycle of a product. This is also known by other names such as additive manufacturing, layered
manufacturing, solid freeform manufacturing, e-manufacturing or digital manufacturing. These
technologies allow rapid prototyping of a new product design, an exercise that is usually carried
out before full-scale production with specialized moulds, tools or jigs. With conventional subtractive
toolroom fabrication techniques, prototyping is a tedious process involving considerable skilled hand
labour in various fabrication processes such as cutting, bending and shaping. Further, prototyping
process requires several iterations before the product design is ﬁnalized and declared ready for full-
scale production. As a consequence, prototyping with conventional technologies is cumbersome and
often very expensive.
Lasers in Industry
411

Rapid manufacturing is also used for the fast fabrication of tools required for mass production. Rapid
prototyping and manufacturing technologies offer the advantages of reduced time to market, reduced
fabrication cost and enhaced capability to fabricate complex features that otherwise would not have been
possible with traditional machining. These are extensively used for the fabrication of both models and
prototypes as well as functional components from metals, plastics and composite materials in the
military and the aerospace industry. The technologies are also well established for the fabrication of
small products and microsystem applications in medicine and in the consumer electronics industry.
11.9.1
Additive Versus Subtractive Manufacturing
Manufacturing technologies are broadly categorized as additive and subtractive. In the case of additive
manufacturing, the technology used in rapid manufacturing, a 3D CAD model of the product is
transformed into thin horizontal virtual cross-sections. The machine reads in the transformed CAD
drawing data of the product to be manufactured and deposits successive layers of liquid, powder or sheet
metal to build the ﬁnal model. These different layers correspond to different horizontal virtual cross-
sections.
The term subtractive manufacturing has been coined only recently to distinguish it from additive
manufacturing. It refers to traditional CNC (computer numerical control) machining methods such as
cutting, milling and shaping, involving the removal of material rather than addition of it. In the case of
subtractive manufacturing, a cutting machine such as a lathe or milling machine is commanded by a
computer to cut a speciﬁc shape. The process usually involves a large number of different steps and
several changes of cutting tool. In additive manufacturing, the ﬁnal product is built by adding material
instead of cutting it away, enabling a much wider range of shapes including cavities or intricate
geometries that would otherwise be impossible to machine.
11.9.2
Rapid Manufacturing Technologies
The various types of rapid manufacturing technologies differ mainly in usable materials and in the way
different layers are deposited to create the ﬁnal product. Commonly used rapid manufacturing
technologies include the following:
1. stereo lithography;
2. selective laser sintering;
Figure 11.21

412
Lasers and Optoelectronics

3. shape deposition manufacturing;
4. laminated object manufacturing;
5. 3D printing.
In stereo lithography, the base material used is photosensitive polymer resin. A UV laser beam is used
to scan the liquid surface of a resin bath. The laser radiation causes the resin to cure in the shape of a layer
of the part to be manufactured. Different layers combine to form the desired 3D shape of the ﬁnal part.
In selective laser sintering, material in the powdered form is deposited on a platform. A CO2 laser is
used to selectively melt or sinter the powder into the shape of a layer. As successive layers are formed,
these are lowered onto the platform. The loose powder material around the growing structure acts as a
support for the top powder layer. Selective laser sintering can be employed to a wider range of base
materials including thermoplastics and metal and ceramic powders. Laser power and scanning speed can
be varied to control porosity and strength of the material. The technique is commonly used for the
fabrication of turbine rotors and medical inserts.
Shape deposition manufacturing combines the deposition process with CNC machining. In this
technique, each successive layer is deposited and machined. After every deposition and machining
operation, new material is added and part machined again before the next layer is deposited. Incremental
machining allows the use of thick layers while maintaining a smooth ﬁnish. Use of support material
enables layers with overhanging, undercut and separated features to be supported during fabrication.
In the laminated object manufacturing process, parts are made from a sheet material bonded together
in layers to form a laminated structure. Commonly used base materials include plastic, water-repellent
paper, ceramic and metal powder tapes. The technique is used for fabrication of casting dies for
automotive parts.
3D printing is similar to inkjet-printing technology. A group of print heads is scanned across a
powdered material bed. During the scanning operation, the print heads distribute a liquid binder that
binds the material to form the desired shape of a layer. The process is repeated to form successive layers
lowering the part and adding additional powder before each successive layer is formed. After all layers
are formed, the part is removed from the powder bed and cleaned. 3D printing technology is extensively
used in the fabrication of functional metal parts and mould inserts.
11.9.3
Lasers for Rapid Manufacturing
Commonly used laser types for rapid manufacturing include pulsed and CW CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers
emitting at 10.6 mm and 1.064 mm, respectively. Use of semiconductor diode lasers emitting at 810 nm
have also been experimented with. The key disadvantage with a diode laser is its low beam quality.
Most commercial rapid manufacturing machines are equipped with CO2 lasers as they have a higher
efﬁciency and low operational and maintenance costs compared to Nd:YAG lasers. Output laser power is
typically in the range 50–500 W. Higher-power CO2 lasers with output power level in the kilowatt range
are also used.
Pulsed and CW Nd:YAG lasers are also widely used for rapid manufacturing, particularly parts made
of metals and metal alloys, due to much higher absorptivity and better coupling efﬁciency of Nd:YAG
wavelength of 1.064 mm compared to 10.6 mm of CO2 laser. This leads to a higher melting depth for the
same power density of Nd:YAG laser compared to CO2 laser. Another advantage of the Nd:YAG laser is
the possibility of using optical ﬁbre for output beam delivery. Studies have shown that, for the same
output laser energy of Nd:YAG and CO2 lasers, the former produces higher energy density, deeper
sintering depth and a larger processing window. Compared to CW Nd:YAG lasers, pulsed lasers offer
better metallurgical bonding of tracks and layers by using high-pulse-energy and narrow-pulse-width
output. Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers producing nanosecond pulses at repetition rates of the order of tens of
kilohertz have been used.
Figure 11.22 depicts a laser prototyping machine, Model EOS P760 from EOS GmbH. The machine
employs selective laser sintering technology and uses twin CO2 lasers to fabricate single-piece large
parts with dimensions up to 700 mm  380 mm  580 mm.

Advantages
There are many advantages of rapid manufacturing, which is characterized by its high accuracy, low cost
and reduced time to market. Rapid manufacturing:
 can be used to process a wide range of materials that can be melted and fused by a laser into a useful
component in a single step;
 offers process ﬂexibility due to the possibility of adjustment of process parameters such as laser power,
feed rate and layer thickness;
 allows the same equipment to be used in the processing of diverse materials;
 can process different materials (or gradations of materials) within a single component to enhance
certain properties; and
 allows component features that are either impossible or difﬁcult to machine or required joined
assemblies of subcomponents to be fabricated in a single step.

Lasers in Printing
Laser printer is a common type of computer printer that uses a non-impact photocopier technology to
produce high-quality printing of both text and graphics on paper. The process is very similar to
xerography (also known as electrography) with the printing mechanism involving the same basic steps:
charging, exposure, development and transfer and fusing.
Laser printing technology was invented in 1969 at Xerox Corporation, an American multinational
company engaged in the manufacture of a wide range of monochrome and colour printers, copier
machines, document management systems, multifunction systems and digital production presses. The
ﬁrst prototype was created by modifying a photocopier machine in 1971 at Xerox. IBM introduced the
ﬁrst commercial laser printer in 1975 for use with its mainframe computers, followed by the ﬁrst LaserJet
printer for use with personal computers in 1984 by Hewlett-Packard.
Early laser printers were restricted to printing letters, ofﬁce memos, spreadsheets, white papers and
other routine business requirements, but today’s laser printers provide advanced graphics functions such
as desk top publishing, the creation of promotional materials and customized designs. This has become
possible due to the simplicity and user-friendliness of laser printers, the availability of multiple functions
such as printing, copying and scanning in a single integrated machine, the improvement in the
speciﬁcations of existing features such as resolution and print speed, the addition of new features
and their reduced price tag.

11.10.1
Laser Printing Process
The complete laser printing process can be described as a set of operations, including: charging, data
transfer, drum writing, paper feed, toner pick-up, image transfer, fusing and drum preparation. These
steps are brieﬂy described in the following.
In the ﬁrst step, the computer generates a query to make sure that a printer is attached to the output port
and is ready. The printer sends a signal back indicating it is ready for data. The computer sends the print
job to the printer, which is stored in the printer’s memory. In most laser printers, some memory is built
into the system board but they also allow external memory modules to be attached. Additional memory
allows larger print jobs to be stored in the printer’s memory.
In the next step, the photosensitive drum is charged. The photosensitive coating on the drum is usually
of an organic photoconducting material. The organic photoconductor has insular-like properties when in
the dark, and is often negatively charged due to its photoconductive properties. In earlier machines,
electrostatic charging was carried out by a contact-free corona discharge method; in recent times, it has
become common practice to use contact-charging methods involving charging by a roller or a brush,
producing signiﬁcantly lower ozone. The electrostatically charged drum is then ready to receive the
image stored in the form of data in the printer’s memory.
In the third step, the data stored in the printer’s memory is written onto the drum using a laser. The
data stored in the printer’s memory is used to control the on and off operation of the laser by
selectively hitting the charged drum at certain spots, thereby changing the electrical charge of those
spots. This leads to the formation of a latent image on the drum, which is a negative of the print
image.
In the fourth step, the photoconducting surface with the latent image is exposed to the toner. The toner
particles are given a negative charge, so are electrostatically attracted to areas on photoconductor’s latent
image left neutralized by the laser. The negatively charged toner does not attract areas on the drum that
have retained negative charge.
In the ﬁfth step, paper is fed in with the help of a set of rollers. The paper is charged before it comes
into contact with the photoconductor drum. As the sheet of paper completes a rotation, it magnetically
attracts the toner particles from the drum, thereby transferring the image to the paper. Charged areas of
the drum do not attract toner, and result in white areas on the paper.
At this stage, the toner is loosely held onto the paper by gravity and a weak electrostatic charge. For
permanent adherence, it must be fused. The fusing operation is basically the process of melting the
toner’s plastic particles so they stick or fuse to the ﬁbres in the paper. The fusing operation is performed
with a non-stick roller with a high-power lamp that heats the paper to about 160–180 C. A pressure
roller in the fusing assembly, which is a rubber roller, presses against the fuser roller. The paper feeds
between the pressure and fuser rollers on its way through the printer.
The last step involves cleaning the drum to remove any traces of previous print and prepare for
the next printing operation. First, a rubber blade wipes the excess toner from the drum. This is
followed by electrostatically cleaning by discharge lamps, which neutralize any residual electrical
charges on it.
Figure 11.23 depicts the laser printer hardware, illustrating the different operations involved in laser
printing.
11.10.2
Anatomy of Laser Printer
A laser printer has four subparts: paper feeder unit, processing unit, print head and fuser unit. The paper
feeder unit feeds the paper into the print mechanism and comprises paper tray, paper take-up roll and
paper take-up switch. The processing unit comprises toner cartridge, developer and drum. The toner is a
mixture of ﬁne particles of dry plastic powder and carbon black or colouring agents. The colouring agent
is blended into ﬁne particles of plastic powder. The plastic particles melt during the fusing operation due
to heating, thereby binding the colouring agent to the paper. The developer supplies toner to the drum and
makes sure that it is uniformly spread over the photoconductor drum. The drum consists of an aluminium
cylinder coated with a photosensitive material such as selenium (used in earlier printers) or organic
Lasers in Industry
415

photoconductors (used in modern printers). Commanded by data representing the document to be
printed, a laser beam produces a latent image on the drum. The drum subsequently transfers this image to
the paper. The print head unit consists of the laser and beam delivery optics, and is used to create an
electrostatic image on the drum. The fuser unit performs the function of binding the loosely attached
toner to the paper.
11.10.3
Choice Criteria
Important laser printer features that should be considered when choosing a printer for your application
include resolution, print capacity and speed, paper handling, FPOT (ﬁrst-paper-out time) and warm-up
time, network compatibility and printer languages.
Printer resolution describes the number of dots that can be put onto the paper within a square inch.
It is usually measured as dpi (dots per inch). Some printers have different resolution in the vertical
and horizontal directions. A resolution of 720  360 implies 720 dots per inch in the vertical
direction and 360 dots per inch in the horizontal direction. The standard resolution in most laser
printers today is 600 dots per inch. This resolution is sufﬁcient for normal everyday printing,
including small desktop publishing jobs. A high-end printer intended for heavy-duty production jobs
would usually have a resolution of 2400 dpi. Resolution of 300 dpi or lower causes uneven lines to
appear on the outer edge of an image. Some printer manufacturers use resolution enhancement
technology. If you must buy a printer with a resolution of 300 dpi, make sure that it is equipped with
this technology.

Print speed and capacity is another important feature. Low-end printers print up to 8 ppm (pages per
minute). Home and small ofﬁce printers print up to 24 ppm and are required to print up to 1000 ppm.
Production printers used by large commercial houses may be required to print 50 000 pages or more per
week and work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. These printers are capable of printing up to 1000 ppm or
even more.
Paper handling capability is an important consideration when choosing a printer. Most laser printers
can only print on letter-size or A4-size paper. High-end printers can print on various paper sizes including
legal and ledger paper, A3 and other larger paper sizes, transparencies, adhesive labels and lightweight
cards. Most laser printers print on one side of paper with the facility for manual duplex printing. Manual
duplex printing is achieved by changing the print options in the printer’s properties or printing one side
and taking that same paper and reinserting it into the printer to print on the other side. Some printers have
a duplex printing facility, in which the printer can print on both sides of paper without any manual
intervention.
Other considerations when choosing a printer are FPOT, warm-up time (the time for the fuser to warm
up to the operating temperature) and the time taken by the printer to prepare itself to print a new job
(typically 5–30 s). If the printer has a standby mode or is turned off between printing jobs, the warm-up
time becomes even more important. Large production printers take up to several minutes to warm up,
which can slow down the printing process.
Laser printers can either have a toner and drum integrated within a single printer unit, or be provided
with separate toner and drum units. The latter have the advantage of reduced operational costs, as the
toner would usually run out much earlier than the drum. It is a lot easier to replace integrated package.
Laser printers can also be shared in a network (although some of the low-end computers can only be used
by a single computer). The replacement cost of consumables such as toner cartridge and drum is also a
consideration.
11.10.4
Laser Printers vs Inkjet Printers
Laser and inkjet printers can be compared and contrasted on the basis of initial and operating costs, print
speed and quality and networking compatibility.
Inkjet printers have low initial but high operating costs, compared to the high initial and low operating
costs of laser printers. The purchase cost of a low-end inkjet colour printer is in the range of US$30–40 as
opposed to US$300–350 in the case of colour laser printers. Laser printers are a better option for heavy-
duty business applications as they are designed to handle a high volume work. The toner cartridge offers
higher capacity in terms of number of pages it can print before needing replacement. In contrast, ink
cartridges require to be replaced quite often when in regular use for printing jobs. On the other hand,
although toner cartridges are more expensive than ink cartridges, they hardly need to be replaced,
lowering the total cost per page.
Laser printers are far more superior to inkjet printers when it comes to printing speed for a
speciﬁed print quality. Inkjet print speed is usually speciﬁed for draft mode or quick-print mode.
The speed drops signiﬁcantly for high-quality printing. Laser printers are preferred over inkjet
printers when required to handle large volumes of print jobs, and are more suited to general ofﬁce
use than inkjet printers. Inkjet printers are generally preferred by individual users for lesser printing
needs.
Laser printers offer higher resolution than inkjet printers and, as a result of this, print a better-quality
text. High resolution also helps the laser printers create precise fonts without fuzzy edges, an effect
which is more pronounced when printing text in smaller font sizes. However, relatively lower-cost inkjet
printers are usually recommended for inexpensive colour printing. Laser printers can produce good-
quality prints on all kinds of printing paper, whereas inkjet printers will require special inkjet paper to
produce good-quality prints.
High-end laser printers usually come with networking facilities and can therefore be directly
connected to a computer network. On the other hand, inkjet printers cannot be directly connected to
a network; they are networked via a computer.

Summary
 Laser-based material-processing applications can be classiﬁed into (1) applications requiring limited
laser power/energy and causing no signiﬁcant change in phase or state of the material in solid state and
(2) those involving phase changes and requiring higher power/energy to induce those changes from
solid to liquid or solid to vapour phase.
 Different material-processing applications can be better understood by analyzing the three basic
phenomena of transmission, reﬂection and absorption. The quantum of laser energy absorbed is of
primary interest in material-processing applications and mainly depends upon some laser
parameters such as wavelength, pulse energy, pulse width, repetition rate, M2 value and material
properties.
 Some common material-processing applications of lasers include cutting, welding, drilling,
marking, photolithography, micromachining, rapid manufacturing, photolithography and laser
printing.
 Laser material processing is a non-contact operation. It offers high processing speed and position-
ing accuracy. It is ﬂexible and versatile. It is easily adaptable to automation. It has a narrow heat-
affected zone. It can be used to machine a wide range of materials and also difﬁcult-to-work
materials.
 Laser cutting involves use of a high-intensity infrared laser beam focused on the surface of the work
piece with the help of optics. This in turn heats up the material and creates a localized melt throughout
the depth of the work piece. A gas jet acting coaxially with the laser beam removes the molten
material. The laser beam is moved across the surface to produce the cut. Laser cutting yields high-
speed cutting, a narrow cut width and reduced material waste. The cutting process is far safer than its
mechanical counterpart, and it can be a fully CNC non-contact process.
 Laser welding involves use of high-energy pulsed laser beam focused on the surface of the work piece
with the help of either bulk optics or ﬁbre-optics module. The high energy density in the focused laser
beam drills into the metal, vaporizes and melts some of the metal; the joining of the two parts is
established as the common melt solidiﬁes. The advantages of laser welding include low heat input and
small heat-affected zone, which makes it ideal for products that require welding near electronics,
glass-to-metal seals and so on.
 Laser drilling generally occurs through the processes of melting and vaporization (also called ablation)
of the work piece when the energy of a focused laser beam is absorbed. The drilling operation largely
depends upon pulse energy and duration. Present-day applications include drilling of cooling holes in
aircraft engine blades and combustors, inkjet nozzles, fuel injector nozzles, cigarette ﬁlter paper and
vias in printed circuit boards.
 Laser marking is one of the most widely exploited industrial applications of lasers. Laser marking
has various forms such as an alphanumeric code imprinted on a label or surface of product
carrying information (e.g. manufacturing data, expiry date, serial/part number), a machine-
readable barcode or a 2D symbol. It is primarily a surface process; the pulsed laser light is
absorbed by the work piece and is converted into heat. The short pulse width in the range of tens of
nanoseconds to several microseconds causes an instantaneous rise in temperature, leaving a
resultant mark.
 Laser micromachining is an established technology that ﬁnds application in high-precision micro-
fabrication. Laser micromachining offers many distinct advantages over conventional mechanical,
chemical, ion or particle beam processes, including high-resolution non-contact processing, unlimited
material coverage, the ability to machine ﬂat and multicontoured surfaces and multiprocess compati-
bility. Commonly used lasers for micromachining applications are excimer, Nd:YAG, CO2 and metal
vapour lasers.
 Laser rapid manufacturing is also known as additive manufacturing, layered manufacturing, solid
freeform manufacturing, e-manufacturing or digital manufacturing. Unlike subtractive machining that
removes material to form the ﬁnal part (e.g. CNC machining), this is an additive process that deposits
layers of material to form the ﬁnal part. The laser is used as a heat source.
418
Lasers and Optoelectronics

 Photolithography is an important process used in the semiconductor industry for the fabrication of
semiconductor devices and integrated circuits to selectively remove parts of a thin ﬁlm or bulk of a
substrate. Photolithography makes use of light to transfer a geometric pattern from a photomask onto a
photoresist on the substrate. Chemical treatment is then used to enable deposition of a new material in
the desired pattern on the substrate material. Excimer lasers emitting in the ultraviolet wavelength
band are the preferred laser sources in photolithography, which have largely replaced conventional
gas-discharge mercury lamps emitting in ultraviolet band.
 Laser printing uses a non-impact photocopier technology very similar to xerography with the printing
mechanism involving the same basic steps of charging, exposure, development and transfer and
fusing. Laser printers have higher print capacity and print speed, higher resolution and higher initial
but lower operational cost compared to inkjet printers.

12.1
Introduction
Due to their unique properties, lasers ﬁnd diverse applications in both diagnostic as well as therapeutic
medicine. Laser radiation can be easily controlled, manipulated, focused and conveniently delivered
with the help of ﬁbre optics. The possibility of varying the laser power or energy density over a large
range and the number of available laser wavelengths covering a wide spectrum from ultraviolet to far-
infrared mean that a laser treatment can be selected to match optimum tissue absorption and intended
interaction. Consequently, lasers can be used to diagnose and treat many diseases.
Commonly used laser types for medical applications mainly include CO2 lasers, solid-state lasers,
semiconductor diode lasers, ﬁbre lasers, dye lasers and excimer lasers. Some of the established medical
disciplines where lasers have applications include angioplasty, cancer diagnosis and treatment,
lithotripsy, dermatology, ophthalmology including laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and
photocoagulation, orthopaedics, cosmetic applications such as hair and tattoo removal, mammography,
prostatectomy, optical coherence tomography and surgery.
The chapter begins with the fundamentals of light–tissue interaction mechanisms before discussing
major medical applications of lasers, including both diagnostic and therapeutic applications. The focus is
on the basic operational concept, the type of laser device or equipment used for the purpose and key
advantages of using lasers as compared to alternative techniques.
12.2
Light–tissue Interaction
Medical applications of lasers as outlined in the introduction are classiﬁed as diagnostic and therapeutic
applications. In the case of diagnostic applications, namely light–tissue interaction, the objective is to
understand the pathology and physiology of the tissue through its interaction with light photons. For
example, chemical composition ﬁnger-printing of the tissue could be performed by analyzing the
ﬂuorescence spectra emitted by the tissue. The chemical composition in turn may indicate the severity of
a certain disease. Although optical diagnostics usually depend upon the interaction of light with
endogenous agent constituents, it could also be performed by administering an exogenous agent. In the
case of therapeutic applications, the objective is permanent modiﬁcation of the tissue in question for
treatment of the disease. The optical energy in this case is absorbed by the tissue or an exogenous agent,
which further leads to a photochemical, photomechanical or thermal process depending upon the rate at
which photon energy is absorbed per unit volume of the tissue. In the following sections we discuss the
mechanisms of light–tissue interaction for therapeutic and diagnostic applications.

12.2.1
Light–tissue Interaction for Diagnostic Applications
For diagnostic applications, relevant topics of light–tissue interaction include interaction mechanisms,
optical properties of tissues and the ﬂuence rate distribution in tissues. Each of these is brieﬂy described
in the following sections.
12.2.1.1
Fundamental Interaction Mechanisms
The fundamental mechanisms of light–tissue interaction include absorption, luminescence including
ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence and scattering including elastic and inelastic scattering and some
others.
When a photon interacts with an atom or a molecule, absorption takes place if the photon energy
(¼ hn) matches the energy difference between the discrete quantum states of the atom or molecule. The
number of photons absorbed per unit volume per unit time is given by product of ﬂuence rate
H (photons/cm2/s) and linear absorption coefﬁcient ma (cm1). The absorption coefﬁcient equals the
product of molecular concentration N (cm3) and molecular cross-section s (cm2). The processes that
follow absorption are non-radiative transitions, ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence. Multi-photon
absorption is also possible if the ﬂuence rate is sufﬁciently high. For example, two photons each
having energy of 0.6 eV may be absorbed to a transition energy of 1.2 eV. For further information on the
absorption mechanism, see Chapter 1.
Luminescence is the emission of light from excited electronic states and includes processes of
ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence. Fluorescence emission is associated with electronic transitions
allowed by the spin conservation rule. These occur over a timescale of nanoseconds. Fluorescence
transitions can occur to various vibrational levels associated with the ground state; the ﬂuorescence
emission spectra therefore show several peaks. While absorption occurs from the ground state to any of
the vibrational levels associated with the excited state, ﬂuorescence emission occurs between excited
states to any of the vibrational levels associated with the ground state. In ﬂuorescence emission, a low-
wavelength (higher-energy) photon is absorbed and is almost immediately followed by emission of a
photon at a longer wavelength (lower energy). Since ﬂuorescence emission occurs from same excited
state, the shape of the emission proﬁle is independent of the wavelength of photon used for excitation.
In the case of phosphorescence emission, the overall spin of the electron pair in the excited state is
different from that in the ground state. These excited states are the result of rearrangement of the electron
spin in the excited state in a process called intersystem crossing. Phosphorescence emission occurs
between excited states resulting from intersystem crossing. These excited states are referred to as triplet
states. Transition from an excited state to the ground state is forbidden, and therefore triplet state lifetime
can be very long (of the order microseconds). An oxygen molecule has an unusual triplet ground state,
which allows energy transfer from the triplet to molecular oxygen. This is signiﬁcant from a medical
diagnostics viewpoint as it allows in vivo measurement of oxygen concentration in tissue.
The processes of absorption, ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence are best illustrated in a Jablonski
diagram. Figure 12.1 shows a generalized Jablonski diagram indicating the three types of processes and
different types of possible transitions. A Jablonski diagram illustrates the electronic states of a molecule
and associated transitions. Different states are arranged vertically by energy and are grouped horizontally
by spin multiplicity. In Figure 12.1, radiative and non-radiative transitions are represented by straight and
dotted lines with arrows, respectively. Vibrational levels of the lowest electronic state are represented by
thick lines, whereas higher vibrational levels are indicated by relatively thinner lines.
Radiative transitions include absorption and emission. Non-radiative transitions occur through several
different mechanisms. These include transitions involving relaxation of the excited state to its lowest
vibrational level with the molecule dissipating energy to its surroundings. A second type of non-radiative
transition is the internal conversion, involving transition from the vibrational state of an electronically
excited state to a vibrational state of a lower electronic excited state. Another type of non-radiative
transition is intersystem crossing (mentioned above). In this case, transition occurs to a state with a
different spin multiplicity.

There are two broad categories of scattering mechanisms: elastic scattering and inelastic scattering. In
the case of elastic scattering, the frequency of the scattered radiation is the same as that of the incident
radiation. In the case of inelastic scattering, the frequency of the scattered radiation is different from that
of incident radiation.
The origin of elastic scattering lies in the acceleration of electrons in the tissue caused by forces
exerted by incident electromagnetic radiation. The scattered radiation in this case is of the same
frequency as the incident radiation. Two major forms of elastic scattering are Rayleigh scattering, which
occurs from particles much smaller than the wavelength, and Mie scattering, which occurs from particles
of almost the same size as the wavelength. In a uniform medium, only the incident radiation is
observable. In the case of media where refractive index varies with position, it is possible to detect
scattered radiation. In tissue, the refractive index changes over different length scales extending from
cellular organelles of submicron scale to multicellular organization on a millimetre scale.
Inelastic scattering is produced either by scattering particles in motion or when the incident
electromagnetic radiation excites molecular vibrations. In the case of scattering from a moving particle,
the scattered radiation is Doppler shifted. For a group of moving scattering particles, the resultant
Doppler-shifted radiation spectrum is related to the distribution of particle velocities. One common
medical application of this type of scattering mechanism is the measurement of blood ﬂow in tissues.
Inelastic scattering due to molecular vibrations can be of two types: Stokes Raman scattering and anti-
Stokes Raman scattering. Stokes Raman scattering occurs when the incident photon loses some of its
energy to the scattering particle, with the result that the emitted photon has less energy (or a longer
wavelength) than that of the incident photon. In the case of anti-Stokes Raman scattering, the incident
photon gains energy from the scattering molecule and the emitted photon therefore has higher energy (or
a lower wavelength) than that of the incident photon.

Figure 12.2 illustrates the processes of elastic scattering and the two types of inelastic scattering. It
may be mentioned here that the probability of Raman scattering is several orders of magnitude lower
than that of elastic scattering. In Figure 12.2, the intensity of emission is indicated by the thickness of the
transition lines. In vivo applications of Raman spectroscopy, which is otherwise a highly potent tool for
analytical chemistry, evolved only after technological advances in detectors, laser sources and ﬁbre-optic
delivery systems.
Raman spectroscopy has been used for the detection and identiﬁcation of even single bacteria and
fungi cells due to its unique ﬁnger-printing feature, which allows detection and identiﬁcation of
biochemical components to a high degree of selectivity. The choice of excitation wavelength plays
an important role. Different excitation wavelengths allow different molecular components inside the cell
to be focused on. While visible and near-infrared excitation wavelengths probe the entire set of cell
components and lead to a phenotypic characterization, UV wavelength excitation causes relative
enhancement of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), RNA (ribonucleic acid) and aromatic amino acid
vibrations. These vibrations are very speciﬁc taxonomic markers of microorganisms. A Raman spectrum
captures the sum of all Raman active cell components, therefore characterizing metabolic cellular status.
Raman spectroscopy allows analysis of change in cellular metabolism, and the data can be used to
diagnose cancer and other pathological anomalies.
12.2.1.2
Optical Properties of Tissues
Tissue optical properties of interest include the absorption coefﬁcient, scattering coefﬁcient and
scattering phase function. Another important consideration is the propagation of light in the tissue.
From the viewpoint of biomedical diagnostics, it is important to measure the magnitude of absorption

Elastic and inelastic scattering mechanisms.

425

and scattering coefﬁcients at the wavelength of interest and also their variation as a function of
wavelength. Knowledge of these parameters is important as they are the determinant factors, in addition
to the scattering phase function and light propagation mechanisms that govern the ﬂuence rate
distribution in tissue, during interpretation of results of a diagnostic measurement or execution of a
therapeutic intervention. Optical properties such as birefringence are not important here as they do not
impact ﬂuence rate as much as the previously mentioned parameters.
The absorption coefﬁcient for a given incident wavelength can be determined from the known values
of concentration and molecular cross-section of all chemical species present in the tissue. Since
absorption has a strong dependence upon incident wavelength, the absorption spectrum varies for
different tissues. For example, proteins have strong absorption in the ultraviolet region of electro-
magnetic radiation. Amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan are also efﬁcient absorbers of
ultraviolet radiation in the 250–300 nm range. Protein absorption rapidly decreases with increase in
wavelength. At increased wavelength, dominant absorption occurs in other constituents such as
haemoglobin. The absorption spectrum changes with oxygenation. At infrared wavelengths, absorption
in tissue is predominantly due to water content. To summarize, the three important constituents of a
tissue – namely protein, oxyhemogobin and water – are individually responsible for absorption of
radiation wavelengths in ultraviolet, visible and infrared bands, although the absorption coefﬁcient
varies from one wavelength band to other. The absorption coefﬁcient also depends on the concentration
of constituents.
The scattering coefﬁcient in tissues is not as simple and straightforward to predict as for the case of
absorption. In the case of tissue, the refractive index varies in a complex manner over different length
scales in different tissues. Several models have been developed for the prediction of tissue scattering,
taking into consideration the fractal distribution of scattering particles of different size ranges. Results
obtained from these models closely match the experimental data. Based on these models and
experimental results, the following general observations can be made about tissue scattering.
1. The scattering coefﬁcient is very high for optical bands compared to low-energy X-rays. At visible
wavelengths, typical value is in the range 10–50 mm1, corresponding to a mean free path of
20–100 mm.
2. The scattering coefﬁcient is observed to decrease monotonically with and increase in wavelength.
3. The scattering coefﬁcient is observed to be orders of magnitude larger than absorption coefﬁcient,
except for ultraviolet and infrared wavelength bands.
Tissue structures that are comparable to or larger than the optical wavelength dominate the scattering
phase function. This leads to scattering that is forward peaked.
12.2.1.3
Fluence Rate Distribution
Fluence rate distribution in tissue plays an important role during therapeutic procedures; it is therefore
important to understand and examine ﬂuence rate distribution issue as a function of wavelength. For a
given irradiance and irradiance geometry, ﬂuence rate distribution mainly depends upon the absorption
and scattering coefﬁcients of the tissue. In general, the absorption coefﬁcient varies by several orders of
magnitude across a wide range of biomedical applications. In contrast, the scattering coefﬁcient
decreases slowly as a function of wavelength. Scattering coefﬁcient has an insigniﬁcant impact on
determining ﬂuence rate distribution in ultraviolet and infrared wavelength bands; its inﬂuence is more
predominant in the visible and near-infrared wavelength bands.
Light propagation in tissue also plays an important role in the prediction of ﬂuence rate distribution
during therapeutic procedures, the interpretation of results of diagnostic measurements and modelling
for optimization of diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Propagation models such as the radiative
transport equation (RTE) and Monte Carlo simulation are commonly used. A detailed description of
these models is beyond the scope of the present text.

12.2.2
Light–tissue Interaction for Therapeutic Applications
In light–tissue interaction for diagnostic applications, it is the behaviour of photons that is affected by the
presence of cells or tissues. Cells or tissues are not affected during the process. Here we describe the
effect of light photons on cells or tissues. It is only when tissue is affected by the photons that a
therapeutic function is possible. Although both lasers and conventional light sources such as arc lamps,
incandescent lamps and light-emitting diodes (LEDs) can be used for the purpose, the laser offers
distinctive advantages over conventional sources due to its monochromaticity, directionality and ability
to generate short intense pulses. The laser effect on tissue is mainly determined by its CW power/pulse
energy, wavelength and pulse duration. From the viewpoint of therapeutic applications, the nature of the
light–tissue interaction can be either photochemical, photothermal or photomechanical. The biological
structure that interacts with light could be an organelle, a cell or a tissue or an organ. A third factor that
determines the nature of the interaction is the time duration.
Light–tissue interaction for therapeutic applications can therefore be explained in terms of three
parameters: the mechanism, the biological structure and the time course. This is diagrammatically
represented by the cube of laser–tissue interaction as shown in Figure 12.3. The three axes of the cube
represent these three parameters. The x-axis represents the mechanism of interaction (chemical, thermal
and mechanical), the y-axis the level of biological structure that absorbs photons (organelle, tissue and
organ) and the z-axis the time course (immediate effect, delayed effect and long-term effect). Time
course here signiﬁes any physical effect or a variation in biological response with time. In the following
sections we brieﬂy describe the three mechanisms of interaction (photochemical, photothermal and
photomechanical).
12.2.2.1
Photochemical Effects
Photochemical reactions have a wide range of applications in industry and medicine. The phenomenon is
a common occurrence in nature; one such example is the photochemical reaction produced by the
absorption of sunlight by chlorophyll in plants to yield excited molecular states. The energy of excited
molecular states is then used to bind water and carbon dioxide as sugars. Light-activated adhesives are
Figure 12.3
Cube of light–tissue interaction.
Lasers in Medicine
427

routinely used in industry. Photochemical effects form the basis of treatment of various diseases in
different branches of medicine including oncology, dermatology and ophthalmology.
Laser wavelengths in ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared bands are used for photochemical reactions
involving changes in electronic states. Laser wavelengths in mid-infrared and far-infrared bands are used
for photochemical reactions involving vibrations in molecular bonds. The rate of production of
photochemical reaction product is directly proportional to the incident irradiance, the absorption
coefﬁcient of the photosensitive molecule and the quantum efﬁciency that speciﬁes the fraction of
absorbed photons causing conversion. The absorption coefﬁcient is given by the product of extinction
coefﬁcient and the concentration of the photosensitive molecule.
Some common applications of photochemical effects in medicine include treatment of psoriasis of the
skin involving ultraviolet light activation of psoralen (a type of photoreactant) to achieve cross-linking of
the DNA in order to control pathological proliferation. Another application is in photodynamic therapy
(PDT), involving the use of visible or near-infrared light in the presence of singlet oxygen at ambient
levels. Light is absorbed by the photosensitive drug, which passes its activation energy to oxygen thus
oxidizing and killing the tumour. The therapy is also in use for the treatment of macular degeneration of
the eye.
12.2.2.2
Photothermal Effects
Photothermal effects produced in the tissue on absorption of laser energy are the basis of a wide range of
therapeutic applications. The treatment of a detached retina through coagulation of tissues is a common
example. Laser coagulation is also an effective tool for treatment of tumours.
When laser energy is absorbed in a tissue, it is converted into heat which causes a rise in temperature.
Laser heating density Q (Jcm3) and the associated surface temperature rise DT are given by
Equations 12.1 and 12.2:
Q ¼ maEt
(12.1)
DT ¼ Q
rCp
(12.2)
where
ma¼ absorption coefﬁcient (cm1)
E ¼ laser power density (W cm2)
T ¼ exposure time (s)
r ¼ tissue density (g cm3)
Cp¼ speciﬁc heat (J g1 C1)
Temperature rise varies as a function of depth z as given by Equation 12.3:
DT z
ð Þ ¼ DTemaz
(12.3)
For a given laser energy density, the surface temperature rise is proportional to the absorption
coefﬁcient. The temperature rise below the surface is a function of absorption coefﬁcient and depth.
Laser heating therefore depends not only on laser energy delivered to the tissue but also on the absorption
coefﬁcient and the penetration depth. Penetration depth is the distance below the surface where the
temperature rise falls to 37% (¼1/e) of its maximum value at the surface.
Thermal diffusion is another parameter involved in the heating of the tissue. Thermal diffusion
causes heat energy to dissipate, thus lowering the temperature. A small heat zone cools faster than a
large heat zone by thermal diffusion. If the energy is deposited over a diameter d, then the time in
428
Lasers and Optoelectronics

which the temperature rise drops to 37% of the initial value, also called relaxation time tr, is given by
Equation 12.4:
tr ¼ d2
4a
(12.4)
where a is thermal diffusivity (m2 s1).
Thermal damage caused to the tissue is an important requirement when it comes to the use of
photothermal effects for therapeutic applications. In the case of diagnostics, there is no permanent
change to the tissue. The objective of therapeutic use of lasers is to cause some kind of controlled damage
to the tissue. Prediction of thermal damage to the tissue due to laser irradiation involves modelling light
propagation and distribution in the tissue and predicting the resultant thermal damage. Damage results
when the tissue is exposed to a high temperature for a prolonged period of time. If the temperature is less
than a certain threshold temperature, called critical temperature, the rate of damage accumulation is
negligible. In diagnostic and photochemical therapeutic applications, temperature is kept below the
critical temperature.
As tissue temperature exceeds the critical temperature, the ﬁrst form of thermal damage observed in the
tissue is coagulation, caused primarily by denaturation of cellular and tissue proteins. Denaturation
increases the scattering coefﬁcient with the result that light is scattered out of the tissue making it appear
white. Cooked egg white is a good example of coagulation. Collagen-rich tissues such as tendon and skin
become transparent on coagulation as the scattering coefﬁcient decreases. Coagulation falls more within
theregimeofnon-ablativeheating.Ifthetemperaturecontinuestorisebeyondtherangeforcoagulation,the
result is vaporization. Most tissues have a high water content. Water vaporizes around 100 C and, for still
higher ﬂuence rates, more vapour is generated than is possible to escape by diffusion. Excess vapours are
trapped between tissue layers and subsequently become superheated to createvapour bubbles or expanding
vacuoles. This further leads to rupturing of the walls of the vacuoles, creating holes in the tissue.
In addition to the use of photocoagulation to treat a detached retina and small tumours, another
common application of photothermal effects is in dermatology where the thermal damage effect is used
for the treatment of vascular lesions such as portwine stains. In the process, laser energy is selectively
deposited in blood vessels helped by the strong absorption of light by haemoglobin. The transient
temperature rise causes thermal damage to the vessel wall, leading to clotting called thrombosis of the
vessel. The clotted vessel is removed by the body’s wound-healing response, removing the portwine
stain lesion.
12.2.2.3
Photomechanical Effects
Mechanical effects produced as a result of deposition of laser energy as thermal energy include
thermoelastic expansion, cavitation, vaporization and plasma formation.
Thermoelastic strain is produced due to the temperature rise caused by deposition of thermal
energy. Strain produces stress or pressure; the pressure P exerted by the thermoelastic strain is given by
Equation 12.5:
P ¼ Me ¼ MbDT
(12.5)
where
b ¼thermal expansivity (C1)
M ¼bulk modulus (J cm3)
DT¼temperature rise (C)
Pressure waves tend to propagate away from the tissue as sound waves. In order to produce condition
of stress conﬁnement, which is desirable, it is important that the energy is deposited in a target tissue
volume at a rate faster than it can dissipate as propagating pressure waves. To achieve this, the laser pulse
Lasers in Medicine
429

width should be less than the ratio of the size of tissue volume to the velocity of sound in tissue. Laser-
induced pressure waves are not used for any therapeutic application, but they are important as they form
the basis of cavitation.
Cavitation is the result of stress caused by thermoelastic strain exceeding a certain limit. When the
limit is exceeded, the tissue breaks. In the case of solids, it leads to the formation of a void, which
subsequently grows usually along the plane of the fracture; this process is called spallation. In liquids, it
leads to the initiation and subsequent growth of a bubble; this process is known as cavitation. Cavitation
can have possible applications in the removal of thin layers of tissue without causing any signiﬁcant
thermal damage or surface modiﬁcation of a biomaterial.
Vaporization of water in tissue is another effect produced by temperature rise. The vaporization
process can take three forms: surface vaporization, subsurface explosive vaporization and explosive
expansion of superheated ﬂuid. Surface vaporization takes place when a vapour is formed at the surface.
The phenomenon can be used to desiccate superﬁcial layers of a tissue. In the case of subsurface
explosive vaporization, vapour is formed below the surface. Vapour in this case is conﬁned and not able
to escape. With a further rise in temperature, vapour pressure builds up. When vapour pressure
overcomes tissue strength, rapid vapour expansion disrupts the tissue.
Another situation is that of superheated ﬂuid expansion, which occurs when temperature rise is
signiﬁcantly large to supply the entire heat for vaporization. In this case, water in tissue is explosively
ejected. Vaporization process is used to remove large tumours such as obstructing lung or brain tumours.
The process is particularly suitable for removing difﬁcult-to-access tumours. The tumour in this case
breaks into gas-borne particles, which are then removed by vacuum dump. A CO2 laser emitting at
10.6 mm is the preferred laser due to its high absorption by water at 10.6 mm. Reshaping corneal collagen
is another application based on the vaporization process. An ArF excimer laser emitting at 193 nm is the
laser of choice due to its high absorption by proteins.
When the laser irradiance on the tissue exceeds approximately 10 MW cm2, there is an optical
breakdown leading to the formation of plasma. Plasma formation essentially involves electrons being
stripped off by intense electric ﬁelds, leading to the ionization of molecules. A bubble is formed, which
expands to its maximum diameter and then collapses to generate extreme pressures producing tissue
disruption. It can be created by using nanosecond pulses such as those from Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers
focused at the target point. One common application of the use of plasma is in post-cataract surgery
treatment where the laser is focused into the eye near the implanted artiﬁcial lens to disrupt an opaque
ﬁlm interfering with vision. The mechanism is also used to disrupt large kidney stones.
12.3
Laser Diagnostics
Laser diagnostics and optical diagnostics in general are based on changes in one or more measurable
properties of light in ultraviolet, visible or near-infrared wavelength bands as it transmits through and/or
reﬂects from tissues after light photons interact with tissue structure and molecules. There are two broad
categories of diagnostic techniques: in vivo and in vitro.
In vivo diagnostic techniques are either non-invasive or minimally invasive and are performed on a
living organism, as opposed to in vitro techniques that are used outside a living organism in a controlled
environment. Some common examples of in vivo diagnostic applications include medical imaging such
as X-ray imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) and monitoring
techniques such as electrocardiography (ECG) and electroencephalography (EEG).
In vitro diagnostics on the other hand involves the removal of tissue such as blood, saliva and biopsy
samples from a living organism for examination in the controlled environment of a laboratory. Some
examples of in vitro diagnostic equipment and tools range from over-the-counter pregnancy testing kits
to highly sophisticated molecular or nucleic acid tests. In addition to the test elements, that is, the
reagents, in vitro diagnostics also includes equipment used to analyze results.
In the following sections we discuss the fundamentals of optical diagnostics, their comparison with
other medical diagnostic techniques and the advantages and limitations of optical diagnostic techniques.
Some common in vivo diagnostic techniques are also described brieﬂy.
430
Lasers and Optoelectronics

12.3.1
Basic Principle
The underlying basic principle of all optical diagnostic techniques is derived from two fundamental
characteristics of light–tissue interaction: one related to the magnitude of photon energy and the to the
wavelength of light, namely size or dimension of cellular structures. The photon energies corresponding
to light in ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared wavelength bands is of the same order as the excitation or
vibrational energy levels of the molecule, which makes the process attractive to probe molecular states.
Predominantly, visible and near-infrared wavelengths in the range of 700–1100 nm are used due to their
high molecular speciﬁcity and greater penetration of tissue in this wavelength band. The ultraviolet
wavelength band has limited application due to signiﬁcantly lower tissue penetration and also due to its
potential mutagenicity. Wavelengths above 1300 nm are also of no use for diagnostics due to their
absorption by water content in tissue being too high for any meaningful measurement.
Another feature of optical diagnostic techniques underlying its functioning is that the optical
wavelength region, that is 700–1100 nm, matches very well the dimensions of the cellular structures
of interest, which also have dimensions of the order of a micron.
Optical diagnostic techniques are based on the fact that the optical properties of biological soft tissues
are a function of physiological, functional and pathological condition of tissues and organs. Different
spectral optical properties such as absorptance, reﬂectance, ﬂuorescence and scattering of tissues and
liquids, blood in particular, are different for functional and pathological cases, enabling knowledge of the
tissue or organ clinical state to be obtained by an in situ measurement of these parameters.
In any in vivo optical diagnostic process, the tissue area is illuminated by a low-intensity light ﬂux. The
light ﬂux interacts with the tissue and the backscattered and/or transmitted light ﬂux is registered by a
photosensor. Light–tissue interaction is a complex phenomenon and leads to many linear and non-linear
physical phenomenon such as absorption, scattering, ﬂuorescence and Doppler frequency shift. The
spectral and spatial distribution of measured radiation carries a lot of information about the biochemical
and/or structure composition of the subject tissue. Analysis of the registered physical data is used to
extract the desired diagnostic information. For example, absorption spectroscopy is used to determine
information on water content, lipids and melanin in a tissue. Elastic scattering spectroscopy is used
to extract information on the morphological structure of the tissue. Tissue reﬂectance oxymetry is used to
calculate the level of oxygenated fraction of haemoglobin in blood. Doppler ﬂowmetry can be used for
measuring the dynamics of blood ﬂow.
12.3.2
Comparison with Other Techniques
Optical diagnostic techniques either eliminate or minimize invasiveness as well as pharmaceutical,
chemical and other physiologically undesirable effects on a human organism. This is one of the
distinguishing features that characterize optical diagnostics from other techniques.
The sensitivity of the molecular structure of biological tissues to optical radiation in the ultraviolet,
visible and near-infrared wavelength bands, and also the fact that optical properties of the tissues are
indicators of physiological, functional and pathological state of tissues is another feature of optical
diagnostics that distinguishes it from other diagnostic methods. Note that other techniques such as X-ray
imaging or ultrasound imaging do not offer this sensitivity to molecular structure. In the case of X-rays,
interactions are at an atomic level; in ultrasound imaging, the diagnostic information resides in the
mechanical properties of tissues.
The spatial resolution offered by optical diagnostic techniques is far superior to that achievable from
any other in vivo diagnostic technique. This is due to the wavelength of the optical radiation being of the
same order as the dimension of the cellular structures of interest.
Another salient feature of optical diagnostics is the possibility to use optical labelling to provide
additional molecular, physiological or genetic information not easily obtainable with other methods. As
an example, it is possible to conjugate ﬂuorescent dyes with antibodies or DNA fragments and follow
these by ﬂuorescence imaging as the biologically active agents bind themselves to speciﬁc cellular
targets. Although radio isotope labelling is also possible, the range of possible optical compounds is very
Lasers in Medicine
431

large. Optical labelling will play an increasingly important role in tailoring treatment for individual
patients, supported by knowledge of the molecular/genetic basis of the disease.
Another signiﬁcant advantage of optical diagnostics comes from its compatibility with other diagnostic
techniques, which allows it to be used simultaneously with other treatments. This has been made possible
by ﬁbre-optic delivery and collection of optical radiation. As an example, it is possible to perform optical
monitoring of the brain function while the patient is inside an MRI unit. A ﬁbre-optic Raman
spectroscopy probe may be combined with ultrasound devices, providing high complementarity.
One of the major limitations is the need to have a trade-off between tissue depth and spatial resolution,
two conﬂicting requirements. Depth in tissue is often limited by high optical attenuation levels, even in
the optical window of transmission in the tissue. Spatial resolution is severely affected by elastic
scattering. Optical measurements up to tissue depths of a few centimetres may reduce spatial resolution
to a millimetre or so. On the other hand, micron-level imaging resolution may be achieved in vivo for
tissue depths limited to a few hundreds of microns below the tissue surface.
Another contrasting feature of optical and other diagnostic methods is that the instrumentation for the
latter category is far more generic and broad based. In the case of optical diagnostics, there may be a large
number of distinctly different optical instruments for a single clinical application. Diagnostic instru-
ments such as MRI and CT are very generic with multiple capabilities. On the other hand, optical
instruments are application speciﬁc due to the need for tailoring to a speciﬁc purpose and due to the fact
that optical technologies are relatively less expensive.
12.3.3
In Vivo Optical Diagnostic Techniques
All in vivo optical diagnostic techniques make use of one or more types of interactions that take place
when optical radiation is incident on tissue area. After encountering interaction mechanisms, the light
photons exit the tissue either as a transmitted or reﬂected radiation. It is this exiting light that carries the
diagnostic information. The exiting radiation is measured by a detector system, which may range from a
single photodetector or a highly sophisticated imaging system along with associated optics. The
radiation is comprehensively analyzed to extract the desired diagnostic information.
Since there are a number of different interaction mechanisms, this has led to the introduction of several
in vivo imaging techniques exploiting one or more of the interaction mechanisms and having the ability
to be applied to different clinical applications. Some common diagnostic applications include white light
imaging, diffuse optical spectroscopy, elastic scattering spectroscopy, optical coherent tomography,
Raman spectroscopy, confocal imaging and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy. In addition to these diagnostic
techniques, there are several other optical techniques for clinical diagnostic application that are under
development. These include acousto-optic spectroscopy, photothermal spectroscopy, ﬂuorescence
correlation spectroscopy, speckle interferometry and laser Doppler blood ﬂow measurement. The
more common and established techniques are described in the following sections.
12.3.3.1
White Light Imaging
White light imaging is a type of reﬂectance imaging in which diagnosis is based on the spectral and
spatial appearance of the tissue in the visible range. Optical diagnostic techniques previously depended
heavily upon the physician’s interpretation, expertise and experience. Today, the ability of the
physician’s eye has been extended by use of optical instruments that enhance spectral range and
sensitivity and also provide access to inner structures that otherwise hidden from view.
Examination of a retina by a wideﬁeld retinal scope is one such example; a typical handheld
ophthalmoscope is depicted in Figure 12.4. The instrument uses xenon halogen technology and a
concentrated white light for perfect illumination and crisp retinal detail. Figure 12.5 illustrates a retina
with irreversible retinal damage, obtained by white light imaging. White light endoscopy for exami-
nation of the inner lining of hollow organs such as gastrointestinal tract, bladder, cervix or bronchus is
another common and well-established clinical application of white light imaging.
White light endoscopy has undergone much improvement in terms of instrumentation and associated
capabilities. Hollow tubes with associated lenses and other optical elements and a camera placed external
432
Lasers and Optoelectronics

to the body have been replaced by ﬁbre-optic delivery and a miniature RGB camera placed at the
working end of what is today called a ﬁbre-optic endoscope. Figure 12.6 depicts one such ﬁbre-optic
endoscope comprising a white light source, a ﬁbre-optic cable and a camera ﬁtted to the tip of the edge.
This allows transmission of high-resolution image information electronically for the purpose of viewing.
The use of contrast agents such as absorbing dyes enhances the features of abnormal structures. This
feature in combination with high-magniﬁcation endoscopy can be used to see ﬁne surface features of the
tissue. An emerging trend in in vivo optical diagnostics is use of hyperspectral imaging which allows
imaging at different wavelengths for the purposes of enhanced pathological diagnosis.

12.3.3.2
Diffuse Optical Spectroscopy
Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging is a non-invasive optical diagnostic technique that can quantify the
absorption and scattering coefﬁcients of tissues as deep as several centimetres. By measuring these
optical properties, quantiﬁable and qualitative information about the target tissue can be ascertained.
Elastic scattering and absorption are the basis of light–tissue interaction mechanisms responsible for
most of the diagnostic applications. The elastic scattering coefﬁcient is very high, of the order 10–
100 cm1, at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Elastic scattering is usually forward peaked with a
high anisotropy factor of about 0.9, leading to an effective transport scattering coefﬁcient of 1–10 cm1.
This is the scattering coefﬁcient in the case of isotropic scattering and quite relevant to diffuse optical
spectroscopy measurement. The measurement of the spectral features of diffusely reﬂected or trans-
mitted light at multiple wavelengths yields far greater diagnostic information than is attainable by the
simple qualitative nature of white light imaging discussed in the previous section. The spectral content of
collection optics comprising measured radiation that is diffusely reﬂected or transmitted due to multiple
scattering depends upon the absorption spectrum of the tissues.
Major naturally occurring chromophores in the visible and near-infrared wavelength range include
oxygenated and deoxygenated forms of haemoglobin (HbO2 and Hb, respectively), water, lipids, melanin
and various pigments. Wavelengths that are absorbed more are reﬂected or transmitted weakly. The
diagnostic equipment could range from a simple instrument comprising a white light source, light delivery
and collection optics and a photosensor with a set of ﬁlters, to complex instruments equipped with multiple
sources and detectors and/or high-end spectrographs. The challenge is in being able to identify the
absorption and elastic scattering components from the measured total reﬂectance or transmittance.
One common application of diffused optical spectral measurements is in continuous monitoring of
health status of premature infants during birth or under intensive care. This is usually carried out by
monitoring blood content (Hb þ HbO2) and/or oxygen saturation (HbO2/(Hb þ HbO2) of tissues (in
particular brain tissues) through spectral measurements at discrete visible and near-infrared wavelengths.
Hb has an absorption peak at 550 nm and HbO2 exhibits a double absorption peak at 540 nm and 585 nm.
Another common diagnostic application of diffused optical spectroscopy is as a potential non-invasive
alternative to blood sampling for identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of glucose levels in tissues in diabetic
patients. Another application is in the measurement of changes in breast tissue that may be associated
with breast cancer. In both glucose level measurement and monitoring changes in breast tissue, highly
sophisticated spectral analysis techniques are used though the instrumentation needed for these
applications is relatively simple. For example, in case of breast cancer detection, the challenge lies
in the detection of subtle changes observed in the form of changed water, fat and blood content of breast
with structural and/or physiological changes associated with cancer risk.
12.3.3.3
Elastic Scattering Spectroscopy
Diffused reﬂectance spectroscopy (discussed in the previous section) cannot be efﬁciently used to
determine cellular information about surface layers because the strength of the backscattered light from
Figure 12.6
Fibre-optic endoscope.
434
Lasers and Optoelectronics

the surface layer (e.g. the mucosal layer in hollow organs) is completely swamped by a strong diffuse
reﬂection from a deeper structure. This serious limitation can be overcome by using a multi-layer model
of tissues with known approximate values of absorption and scattering coefﬁcients and employing
numerical subtraction. Another solution to the problem is by employing a polarized light beam that
would allow discrimination between elastic scattered light from the surface layer and that received from
deeper tissues after a large number of scatters. Backscattered light is analyzed to determine scattering
particle size distribution, which is indicative of the size distribution of cell nuclei. It may be mentioned
here that the size of cell nuclei changes when malignant. Elastic scattering spectroscopy has been found
to be accurate in the identiﬁcation of abnormalities of soft tissues, including ischaemia and associated
inﬂammation and pre-cancer and cancer. Figure 12.7 depicts the elastic scattering spectroscopy set-up.
12.3.3.4
Optical Coherence Tomography
When light interacts with tissues, there is a near 180 backscattering that occurs at the microscale
interfaces within tissues due to localized refractive index change. This forms the basis of optical
coherence tomography (OCT), which enables the generation of high-resolution structural images up to a
depth of a few millimetres. The operational principle of OCT imaging is similar to high-resolution
ultrasound imaging, except for the fact that it makes use of a Michelson interferometry to provide spatial
localization rather than echo-ranging by sound waves to map the depth distribution of micro-
inhomogeneities in the tissue. Echo-ranging is not practical in optical coherence tomography at the
micron resolution scale due to the much higher speed of light compared to that of sound waves.
Figure 12.8a depicts the basic principle of operation of OCT. It is basically a Michelson
interferometer with an axially scanned reference mirror in one arm and the tissue in the other.
The beam splitter splits the light beam almost equally into the two paths. The light beam specularly
reﬂected (near-180 backscattering) from the internal optical interfaces of the tissue mixes with the
reference beam to produce an interference pattern at the detector. Constructive interference and a
measurable signal at the detector output are only obtained when the path lengths of the probe beam and
the reference beam are the same or nearly the same, with a path length difference of less than the
coherence length of the light source. Figure 12.8b and c show typical detected signals from a single site
and a single lateral scan, respectively. A 2D or 3D cross-sectional image of the tissue may be generated
with appropriate scanning. OCT synthesizes cross-sectional images from a series of laterally adjacent
depth scans.

Axial resolution achievable in OCT is a function of coherence length which, for a given wavelength l

Þ. The operational wavelength range is 800–1500 nm with 800–850 nm and 1300 nm being
the preferred wavelengths (the latter being particularly important for ﬁbre-optic implementation of
OCT). The chosen wavelength needs to be different from the water absorption peak at 970 nm.

Lateral resolution depends upon the numerical aperture (NA) of the probe beam. High NA provides a
tight focus but a limited depth of focus. Low NA offers a high depth of focus. Lateral resolution typically
achievable is 2–3 times poorer than achievable axial resolution.

OCT is presently used in three different ﬁelds of optical imaging: macroscopic imaging of structures
using weak magniﬁcation; microscopic imaging using very high magniﬁcation; and endoscopic imaging
using low and medium magniﬁcations. One major application area is in ophthalmology due to the
transparent nature of ocular structures. Figure 12.10 depicts an OCTeye fundus examination instrument,
a Canon OCT-HS100, which is mainly intended for the diagnosis of retinal disorders including the
leading causes of eyesight loss, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma. Use of near-infrared
wavelength has made infrared imaging possible for strongly scattering molecules. Optical in vivo biopsy
is one of the most challenging emerging applications of OCT. High resolution and high penetration depth
with associated capability of functional imaging allow a high-quality optical biopsy, enabling in situ
assessment of tissue and cell function and morphology.

illustrates age-related macular degeneration.
12.3.3.5
Confocal Imaging
As for optical coherence tomography, confocal imaging is also used for high-resolution imaging of
subsurface tissue structures. Figure 12.12 illustrates the basic operational principle of the confocal
imaging technique. The source light beam is passed through a pinhole to create a point source. The
expanded light beam passes through a beam splitter, after which it is focused on a point inside the tissue.
The reﬂected light follows the same path and, after reﬂection from the other surface of the beam splitter,
is focused on a photodetector through a second pinhole. The detector is usually a photomultiplier tube to
achieve high sensitivity. The two pinholes deﬁning the point source and point detector are conjugate
points. This implies that light back-reﬂected off-focus has an extremely low probability of detection.
Only the signal collected from the diffraction-limited point within the tissue has a high probability of
detection. A laser beam may be scanned across the sample in the focal plane to generate a 2D x–y image.
A 3D image may also be created by successively scanning the z-planes.
Confocal imaging is commonly used for in vivo imaging of tissues. One such application is in imaging
skin tumours to guide surgical resection. Another common application of confocal imaging is in high-
resolution imaging of the eye in what is known as confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscopy. Figure 12.13
depicts the schematic arrangement of a typical laser scanning ophthalmoscope. Endoscopic confocal
imaging is yet another emerging application. Figure 12.14 shows a typical schematic arrangement of an
endoscopic ﬁbre-optic probe using ﬁbre-optic delivery and collection.
12.3.3.6
Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Imaging
Fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging-based diagnostics is based on the ﬂuorescence emission from
speciﬁc chromophores in tissue when excited by short wavelengths, usually in the blue or ultraviolet
Figure 12.11
Retinal images.
438
Lasers and Optoelectronics

range. The emission is in the longer wavelength region of 500–800 nm. Fluorescence-based diagnosis is
implemented in two ways: (1) ﬂuorescence is excited in and detected from naturally occurring molecules
in the tissue, known as auto-ﬂuorescence; and (2) a known ﬂuorophore is administered either
systemically (orally or intravenously) or topically, for example on to skin lesions. In the case of
auto-ﬂuorescence, contributing molecules include structural proteins such as collagen and elastin and
various metabolic compounds. The onset of disease changes the concentration or spatial distribution of
these ﬂuorophores. In the case of exogenous ﬂuorophores, diagnostic information depends upon uptake
and/or retention of the administered drug by abnormal tissues.
Although the ﬂuorescence signal is about three orders of magnitude weaker than the diffused
reﬂectance signal obtained from the tissue due to elastic scattering, it is easily measurable by high-
sensitivity photodetectors making both point spectroscopy as well as ﬂuorescence imaging possible.
Fluorescence-based diagnostic technique is particularly suitable for in vivo investigation of biochemical,
physiological and structural proﬁle of surface layers in tissues, such as the lining of hollow organs such
as lungs, gastrointestinal tract, bladder, oral cavity and cervix. This is important as these are prominent

sites for early cancer and pre-malignant changes in tissues. In addition to the use of ﬂuorescence
spectroscopy and imaging for the detection of cancers in early stages, it has also been used to guide
surgical operations particularly in determining tumour margins with precision. Another possible
application is in assisting intravascular operations such as angioplasty used to clear blocked arteries.
There can be various possible ﬂuorescence spectrometer conﬁgurations, either using free space optics
or ﬁbre optics or a combination of the two for transmit and receive channels. Figure 12.15 shows a typical
schematic arrangement of a ﬁbre-optic ﬂuorescence spectroscopy diagnostic set-up. Output from the
light source of the desired output wavelength is fed to the double-clad ﬁbre (DCF) coupler through output
optics (usually comprising a combination of ﬁlters and a focusing lens) and a single-mode ﬁbre (SMF)
with the same core diameter as the DCF. The SMF is fusion-spliced to the DCF. A neutral density ﬁlter is

used to adjust the intensity of laser radiation input to the sample and a bandpass ﬁlter centred on the laser
wavelength is used to eliminate laser background noise. The DCF core is used to deliver laser radiation to
the sample, while the inner cladding of DCF is used to collect ﬂuorescence emission from the sample.
The receiving channel has a long-pass ﬁlter, a beam collimator and a spectrometer as shown. The long-
pass ﬁlter is used to block fundamental excitation wavelength elastically backscattered from the sample.
Fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging however have some limitations. First, discrimination between
normal and abnormal tissues sometimes becomes difﬁcult due to a lack of prior information on optimal
excitation and emission wavelengths for various organs and diseases. This limitation is largely overcome
in exogenous ﬂuorophores as in that case optimal excitation and emission wavelengths are known. The
ﬂuorescence signal is also relatively stronger, allowing use of less-sensitive detectors. Secondly,
the detected spectra in ﬂuorescence spectroscopy and imaging is difﬁcult to correctly interpret due
to (1) variation in ﬂuorophore concentration with depth; (2) distortion caused by wavelength-dependent
absorption by the tissue; and (3) point-to-point and patient-to-patient variation in the auto-ﬂuorescence
signal. A ﬂuorescence spectrometer is also relatively more expensive than its reﬂectance counterpart,
which may restrict widespread usage for clinical applications.
12.3.3.7
Raman Spectroscopy
The Raman spectroscopy technique of medical diagnostics depends upon inelastic scattering occurring
as a result of light–tissue interaction. There are two forms of inelastic scattering: Stokes scattering, where
the photon loses energy on interaction and the scattered photon has a longer wavelength, and anti-Stokes
scattering, where the photon gains energy and is scattered at a shorter wavelength. This interaction
causes a corresponding change in the vibrational and rotational state of the molecule. Different scattering
mechanisms including elastic scattering and two types of inelastic scattering mechanisms were described
in Section 12.2.1.1 and illustrated by Figure 12.2. The Stokes signal is relatively stronger than the anti-
Stokes signal and, despite the fact that the Stokes signal suffers from the presence of ﬂuorescence
background, it is this mechanism that is normally used for diagnostics. The Raman signal in this case is
characteristic of the stretching and bending modes of the molecule, thus providing molecular ﬁnger-
printing. Compared to auto-ﬂuorescence spectroscopy, the Raman signal is very weak. The weak Raman
signals prevent Raman spectroscopy from being a practical proposition as an imaging technique for
in vivo diagnostics, due to the prohibitively large data collection time required for an acceptable signal-
to-noise ratio. This is not an issue in the case of microscopy of tissues and cells, however.
Figure 12.16 shows the schematic arrangement of a typical ﬁbre-optic Raman spectrometer. In
addition to the well-established use of Raman spectroscopy for analysis of excited tissue samples such as
biopsies using bench-top spectrometers, in vivo Raman spectrometers are also now available. This is due
Figure 12.15
Schematic arrangement of ﬁbre-optic ﬂuorescence spectroscopy set-up.
Lasers in Medicine
441

to the advances in near-infrared diode lasers which produce several hundreds of milliwatts of power, high
throughput holographic spectrographs and cooled CCD array detectors.
Raman spectroscopy for in vivo diagnostics has several serious limitations however, which include the
following.
1. The Raman signal as outlined earlier is a weak signal. Signal-to-noise ratio further suffers due to the
presence of ﬂuorescence background. Although the Raman signal strength could be increased by
increasing sample irradiance, it cannot be increased beyond a few hundreds of milliwatts because of
safety concerns. Higher irradiance may increase tissue heating beyond an acceptable limit. Raman
signal strength increases with a decrease in wavelength as l4. This too is not a practical solution, as a
decrease in wavelength towards the ultraviolet is associated with an increase in ﬂuorescence
background.
2. The detector often needs to be liquid-nitrogen cooled to reduce detector noise and improve signal-to-
noise ratio.
3. Increasing wavelength in an attempt to reduce the ﬂuorescence background causes a higher reduction
in the Raman signal due to the l4 dependence and reduced quantum efﬁciency of the detector. The
ﬂuorescence background can be removed to some extent by taking measurements at two different
wavelengths and subtracting the measured signals.
4. Spectral analysis to extract the desired diagnostic information is very complex in the case of Raman
spectroscopy, as changes in the tissue due to a disease do not generally produce any marked spectral
changes in the form of an increase or decrease in speciﬁc signal peaks. The effect for example may be
in the form of changes in line widths. As a result, simple algorithms such as taking ratio of signal
peaks do not work with Raman diagnostics. More complex spectral analysis techniques, the
description of which is beyond the scope of this book, are required.
12.4
Therapeutic Techniques: Application Areas
Light–tissue interactions of relevance to diagnostic and therapeutic applications of lasers were discussed
Section 12.2. Interaction mechanisms for therapeutic applications include photothermal, photo-
mechanical and photochemical effects. Applications based on photothermal effects depend upon a
temperature rise caused by the absorption of laser energy and are further categorized as photocoagulation
Figure 12.16

Lasers and Optoelectronics

and photo-ablation of tissues. While retinal photocoagulation is a routine clinical procedure, photo-
ablation enables precise surgical cuts. The photomechanical effect causes explosive ablation of tissue
surface with a relatively smaller thermal damage zone and higher ablation efﬁciency compared to
thermal ablation. Photodisruption of tissues is also a routine clinical procedure in ophthalmology for
treatment of post-cataract membranes. The photochemical effect is mainly used in photodynamic
therapy for selective destruction of pathological tissues such as tumours, pre-cancerous or neovascular
tissues. Common therapeutic applications of lasers are brieﬂy described in the following sections.
Common therapeutic applications of lasers include their use in clinical procedures in ophthalmology,
dermatology, dentistry, vascular surgery, photodynamic therapy and thermal therapy.
Some of the most widely used clinical procedures in ophthalmology (that incidentally have no other
alternative therapy) include retinal photocoagulation, photodisruption of post-cataract membranes and
photodynamic therapy in age-related macular degeneration. Photorefractive laser surgery of the cornea
used to correct for refractive errors such as myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism is another routinely
performed clinical procedure in ophthalmic centres.
Photothermal is the most important light–tissue interaction mechanism in dermatology. Most clinical
applications of dermatology are based on the concept of photothermolysis. With the appropriate choice
of laser wavelength, pulse duration and energy, photothermolysis enables selective destruction of
targeted biological tissues. Common applications include the treatment of cutaneous vascular lesions,
pigmented lesions and tattoos and the removal of unwanted hair.
Laser dentistry has rendered many painful and uncomfortable dental operations far less painful.
Common applications include caries prevention, cavity preparation, root canal preparation and
disinfection (endodontics), calculus removal (periodontics), various types of soft tissue surgery and
sterilization, which is killing bacteria without excessive loss of tissue.
A common example of the use of laser therapeutics in vascular surgery is in angioplasty, which
includes peripheral angioplasty (PA) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), commonly known
as coronary angioplasty. PA refers to the use of a balloon to open a blood vessel outside the coronary
arteries, usually carried out to treat atherosclerotic narrowing of the abdomen, leg and renal arteries. PCI
is a therapeutic procedure to treat the narrowed coronary arteries of the heart.
Photodynamic therapy mainly utilizes the photochemical effect and ﬁnds numerous applications in
oncology such as in the treatment of small tumours in the wall of hollow organs, areas of pre-cancerous
change in hollow organs, localized tumours in solid organs, skin tumours and as an aid in surgical
operation to eliminate local residual disease.
Thermal therapy uses the temperature rise caused by the absorption of heat energy for the purpose of
treatment of benign and malignant tumours. The ultimate effect depends upon the quantum of heat
energy delivered to the target tissue, time duration over which it is delivered and the volume of tissue in
which it is absorbed. In addition to the treatment of tumours, another common application of thermal
therapy is prevention of bleeding from the edges of surgical incisions.
12.5
Ophthalmology
The most widespread use of lasers in medicine is in the ﬁeld of ophthalmology for treatment of a wide
range of eye disorders. The coherence of laser light allows it to be transported to a speciﬁc point without
adversely affecting the adjacent areas, and the fact that many of the eye’s structures are transparent to the
visible spectrum of light makes it an excellent tool for the ophthalmologist. Different interaction
mechanisms responsible for various treatment procedures include photocoagulation, photo-ablation,
photodisruption and photodynamic therapy.
In photocoagulation for the treatment of tumours, laser light in the visible green wavelength is
selectively absorbed by haemoglobin, the pigment in red blood cells, to seal bleeding blood vessels. It
ﬁnds diverse therapeutic applications in ophthalmology for the treatment of a detached retina, the
destruction of abnormal blood vessels in the retina and for the treatment of tumours. Photo-ablation is
volatilization of tissue by laser light in the deep ultraviolet wavelength band. It is mainly used in
corrective eye surgery such as LASIK, where it is used to remove tissues by vaporization by transferring
Lasers in Medicine
443

the energy to the target area. Corneal shaping is used to correct the refractive power of the eye.
Photodisruption is disruption of tissues by a laser-induced rapid ionization of molecules. It is an
established method for treatment of post-cataract membranes. Photodynamic therapy is used for the
treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration. PDT is a form of treatment that makes use of a
photosensitive agent administered orally or intravenously. The photosensitive agent becomes concen-
trated selectively in certain cells. The affected tissues are exposed to ultraviolet light to destroy abnormal
tissues.
12.5.1
Refractive Surgery
Refractive defects in human eyes cause blurred vision such as myopia, hyperopia and astigmatism. In the
case of a normal eye, the light that enters the eye is focused on the retina to form the image, which is
transmitted to the brain. In the case of an eye suffering from refractive defects, the image is not formed on
the retina, causing blurred vision. There are three types of refractive defects: myopia, hyperopia and
astigmatism. In a myopic eye, an image is formed in front of the retina as shown in Figure 12.17a causing
distant vision to be blurred. In the case of hyperopia, the image is formed behind the retina as shown in
Figure 12.17b causing blurring of near vision and, with time, also the distant vision. In the case of
astigmatism, illustrated in Figure 12.17c, vision is distorted for both near and distant images. For clear
vision the images must be formed on the retina, and this can be achieved with appropriate glasses, contact
lenses or refractive surgery.
The use of lasers for refractive surgery is one of the most widely used applications of ophthalmology.
The primary objective of the treatment is to achieve the correct relationship between the length of the

Lasers and Optoelectronics

eyeball and the power of its optical centres. An excimer laser emitting at 193 nm is commonly used for
the purpose. In a commonly used refractive method, pulsed laser radiation with a pulse width in the range
of 10–20 ns penetrates the cornea to a depth of 1 mm, leading to photo-ablation of the tissues. Excimer
laser ablation is carried out under a partial thickness lamellar corneal ﬂap. Excimer laser refractive
surgery is not recommended in patients suffering from glaucoma, diabetes, uncontrolled cardiovascular
disease and autoimmune disease. It is also not advisable for pregnant women or people with certain eye
diseases.
Laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), laser subepithelial keratomileusis (LASEK) and photorefrac-
tive keratectomy (PRK) are the three established processes of refractive eye surgery. In the case of
LASIK, a thin hinged ﬂap (thin slice of cornea) is cut open as shown in Figure 12.18b. The ﬂap is cut by
either a microkeratome that involves a blade or a femtosecond laser. Once the ﬂap is cut open, an excimer
laser is used to reshape the cornea by removing tissue from the stromal layer of the cornea, thereby
correcting the refractive error (Figure 12.18c). The corneal ﬂap is repositioned after refractive correction
and allowed to heal (Figure 12.18d). The corneal ﬂap bonds to the cut edge of the cornea naturally and
quickly. Figure 12.19 depicts LASIK surgery in action. The whole process takes about 15 minutes.
In LASEK eye surgery, the microkeratome used to make the incision in the cornea is not used. Instead
of cutting a ﬂap, the outer layer of the cornea, called the epithelium, is lifted. This is carried out by using a
relatively thinner blade called a trephine. The epithelium is treated with 20% diluted alcohol solution to
loosen it and detach it from the underlying tissue. A laser is used to reshape the cornea, thereby avoiding
the complications associated with cutting and reattaching the corneal ﬂap. At the end of the procedure, a
contact lens is inserted to help the epithelium regenerate itself within the next 3–4 days. The procedure is
carried out under topical anaesthesia. Figure 12.20 illustrates the different steps involved in the LASEK
procedure.
As for the LASIK and LASEK procedures, PRK is based on the reshaping of the cornea by excimer
laser, allowing light entering the eye to be properly focused onto the retina. In a PRK procedure, the
entire epithelial layer is removed to expose the corneal area to be treated. An excimer laser works on the
stromal layer of the cornea to correct the refractive error. In PRK the epithelial layer is lifted, preserved

during surgery and repositioned at the end of the procedure (as opposed to it being discarded in LASEK
surgery to allow a new epithelial layer to grow). The healing of the repositioned layer in PRK takes
longer than the growth of a new epithelial layer in LASEK, however.
12.5.2
Treatment of Glaucoma
Glaucoma is an eye disease in which the optic nerve suffers damage. It is caused by increased intraocular
pressure, which causes an atrophy of the optical nerve resulting in a reduced ﬁeld of vision. It may cause
irreversible blindness in the patient if not controlled. The most common form is known as simple chronic
glaucoma. Its incidence increases from 40 years of age. In the case of glaucoma, vision loss is slow,
progressive and irreversible. Early diagnosis and treatment of this disease are very important to avoid
serious damage to the vision. The cases in which there is a constant increase of intraocular pressure
without any associated optic nerve damage are referred to as ocular hypertension, in which there is no
glaucoma damage. If the ocular pressure is normal or low with typical glaucoma, the effect is called
normal or low-tension glaucoma. However, raised intraocular pressure is still the most signiﬁcant risk
factor for glaucoma progression. Glaucoma can also be classiﬁed as open-angle glaucoma and closed-
angle glaucoma; progression of the disease and associated vision loss is much slower in the case of
former, while symptoms of the disease can appear rapidly in the latter.
Both laser and conventional surgeries are performed to treat glaucoma. Selective laser trabeculoplasty
(SLT) is an efﬁcient (and one of the newest) methods for the treatment of glaucoma. It is a form of laser
surgery used to lower intraocular pressure in patients suffering from open-angle glaucoma. In the SLT
procedure, a frequency-doubled Q- switched Nd:YAG laser emitting at 532 nm is used. This laser affects
the cells of the trabecular meshwork without causing any destruction or coagulation (Figure 12.21). The
532 nm wavelength is highly absorbed by melanin and can selectively target pigmented cells while
preserving the surrounding tissue.
The second method of laser treatment in glaucoma is argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT). This
method is focused on drainage correction of ﬂuid from the eye. In open-angle glaucoma the drainage
site of the eye does not function normally and the iris is encircled by the trabecular meshwork of an
eye. The increase of pressure is due to inadequate drainage. In ALT therapy an argon laser beam is
directed at the trabecular meshwork, thereby enhancing ﬂuid drainage efﬁcacy. While the SLT
procedure can be repeated on the same area of the eye, the ALT procedure can only be carried out once
on a given area. Laser iridotomy is another procedure used to reduce intraocular pressure, performed
by drilling a hole in the iris with a laser in order to improve the outﬂow of aqueous humour towards the
drainage angle.

12.5.3
Cataract Surgery
Cataracts are one of the most frequent causes of loss of vision, which occurs due to opacity of the
crystalline lens of the eye as shown in Figure 12.22. Although it is more common in those over the age of
65 years, it may also be present in younger people. Although the cataract is not an ophthalmological
emergency, the surgery must be undertaken as and when recommended by the ophthalmologist rather
than waiting until the cataract matures. Figure 12.23a and b illustrate the mechanism of loss of vision due
to cataracts, depicting a normal eye (Figure 12.23a) and a cataract-affected eye (Figure 12.23b).
The most popular method of cataract surgery is phacoemulsiﬁcation in which the nucleus is cracked
or chopped into smaller pieces to make emulsiﬁcation easier. Two commonly employed techniques
for emulsiﬁcation include extra-capsular cataract extraction (ECCE) and intra-capsular cataract
Figure 12.22

extraction (ICCE). ECCE involves the removal of almost the entire natural lens, keeping the elastic lens
capsule intact to allow implantation of an intraocular lens. This method is used in patients with very hard
cataracts. ICCE on the other hand involves removal of the lens and surrounding lens capsule in one piece.
After removal of the lens, an artiﬁcial plastic lens is implanted.
Laser surgery is one of the most popular cataract treatments available today. It uses light to dissolve the
cataract. Emulsiﬁcation of the lens using the Er:YAG laser is very effective for performing small-incision
cataract surgery in eyes with soft and medium nuclei. The small ablation zones created during treatment
help prevent damage to surrounding ocular structures. The Er:YAG technique causes low ablation energy
and does not result in thermal injury. A Q-switched Nd:YAG laser with a pulse width of a few
nanoseconds and output energy of the order of a millijoule is used to remove post-cataract membranes.
12.5.4
Treatment of Retinal Detachment (Retinopexy)
The retina, a thin membrane covering the inside of the eye, is adhered to the internal surface of the
eyeball; it is analogous to the ﬁlm in a photographic camera. The cornea and the crystalline lens focus the
light entering the eye onto the retina, which converts it into a visual impression and transmits to the brain
through the optical nerve. The retina receives its nutrition from choroid, the layer behind the retina. In the
case of retinal detachment, the retinal membrane is separated from the choroid and ﬂoats in the vitreous
located in the centre of the eye. Detachment of partial or full retinal membrane leads to loss of vision and
complete blinding, respectively. In most cases, retinal detachments are caused either by a tear or
perforation in the retina or traction on the retina by vitreous ﬁlling most of the ocular cavity. Other factors
responsible for retinal detachment could be shrinkage of vitreous and thinning of the retina with age,
high myopia, trauma or hereditary reasons.
A number of surgical procedures are in use for treatment of detached retina. These include laser
photocoagulation, cryopexy, sceral buckle surgery, pneumatic retinopexy and virectomy. Surgical
procedures other than laser photocoagulation will not be discussed here. In the case of laser retinal
photocoagulation, the laser beam combined with ophthalmic equipment and optics is focused on the
retina. The light absorbed in melanin of the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and choroid is used to
cause a controlled damage thereby producing a scar during the healing process. This forms a mechanical
connection between neural retina and the choroid preventing detachment of retina. Argon Excimer laser
emitting at 193 nm and producing output power in the range of 100–400 mWand retinal spot diameter of
about 0.5 mm is commonly used for the treatment. The treatment is usually given at multiple spots.
12.5.5
Treatment of Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
Laser photocoagulation is also extensively used to treat proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic
retinopathy is a disease of the retina caused by diabetes that involves damage to the tiny blood vessels at
the back of the eye. As the disease enters its proliferative stage, fragile new blood vessels grow along the
retina and in the transparent gel-like vitreous that ﬁlls the inside of the eye. If untreated, these new blood
vessels can bleed, cloud vision and destroy the retina. In order to treat the proliferative stage of diabetic
retinopathy, pan-retinal photocoagulation is used. Unlike retinopexy, a much larger number of laser
spots (1000–2000) occupying 20–30% of the retinal area in the middle and outer periphery is used.
Figure 12.24a and b show photographs illustrating laser photocoagulation treatments in retinopexy and
diabetic retinopathy, respectively.
12.6
Dermatology
Dermatological applications of laser therapy make use of the photothermal effect. When absorbed by the
tissue, laser energy causes a rise in temperature. Tissue heating causes structural changes in complex
molecules such as proteins, DNA and RNA. The structural changes further lead to functional
impairment, called denaturation of tissue or grosser structural disorder called coagulation. Coagulation
leads to necrosis and vaporization, which further results in tissue ablation and carbonization. The exact
photothermal effect produced depends upon the magnitude and the duration of the peak temperature
Lasers in Medicine
449

attained by the target tissue on absorption of laser energy. Peak temperature and its duration in turn
depend upon the magnitude of laser ﬂuence absorbed by the tissue and duration of the laser pulse. The
absorption of laser energy is a function of wavelength. Wavelength also determines the depth to which
laser penetrates the tissue. Laser ﬂuence, wavelength and duration are therefore key parameters that
determine the photothermal effect produced in the tissue.
This forms the basis of what is known as selective photothermolysis. The concept of selective
photothermolysis allows use of an appropriate wavelength, duration and energy ﬂuence to thermally
precisely damage the targeted biological tissue without adversely affecting the neighbouring tissue.
Appropriate selection of pulse duration can be used to conﬁne the heat energy to the targeted tissue by
keeping it less than the thermal time constant of the target. It is this precision that is largely responsible
for extensive use of laser therapy for dermatological applications. Having chosen the appropriate value
of wavelength and duration, laser ﬂuence is then selected to produce the desired temperature rise in
the tissue.
Some common applications of laser therapy in dermatology include laser treatment of cutaneous
vascular lesions such as portwine stains (PWS), treatment of pigmented lesions and tattoos and hair
removal. Each of these treatment procedures is brieﬂy described in the following sections.
12.6.1
Portwine Stains
A ‘portwine’ stain is a mark on the skin, usually on the face, resembling port wine in its rich ruby-red
colour. It is a type of vascular malformation due to an abnormal aggregation of capillaries. The colour of

Lasers and Optoelectronics

the stain partly depends upon the erythrocyte content of these capillaries. Laser treatment of PWS is
based on the principle of selective photothermolysis, aiming to reduce the number, size and erythrocyte
content of the capillaries resulting in lightening of the stain. A light beam at 577 nm is selectively
absorbed by haemoglobin compared to other cutaneous structures. The light penetrates the dermal
vessels. Depending upon the laser pulse duration in comparison with thermal relaxation time, there may
be non-selective thermal damage of connective tissues resulting in scarring. It is balance between
keeping the pulse duration short enough to allow selective absorption, but long enough in order to cause
permanent damage to the blood vessels with the consequent lightening of the stain. In the case of patients
with dark skin, a relatively higher laser energy needs to be used as a part of it is absorbed within
pigmented epidermis and less energy reaches the blood vessels, causing an increased incidence of
unwanted post-inﬂammatory pigmentary changes. This shortcoming is partly addressed by dynamic
cooling of epidermis.
Figure 12.25 shows photographs of a child having undergone laser treatment for a portwine stain in
the region between upper lip and nose. Figure 12.25a shows the condition before treatment while
Figure 12.25b shows the condition after treatment. As is evident from the photographs, the stain has
almost vanished, illustrating the efﬁcacy of the treatment.

Pigmented Lesions and Tattoos
Use of lasers for the treatment of pigmented lesions and tattoos is another common application of laser
therapy in dermatology. The treatment procedure makes use of the principles of selective photo-
thermolysis. While the target chromophore in the case of pigmented lesions is melanin present within
cells as melanosome, tattoos use intradermal, intracellular insoluble ink particles. Following the
principles of selective photothermolysis, the laser pulse width is chosen to be less than the thermal
relaxation time of melanosome, which is in the range of 100 ns–1 ms. Although melanosomes show
signiﬁcant absorption in the 200–1200 nm wavelength band, operational wavelength is chosen to be
within the range 630–1100 nm. This is done to eliminate absorption by competing chromophores such as
haemoglobin in the visible band and tissue water in the infrared. Also, longer wavelengths penetrate
better with the result that ultraviolet wavelengths are not an optimal choice. The chosen pulse width is
less than 1 ms, suitable for selective photothermolysis of melanosomes. Damage is caused both due to
thermal effects as well as the shock waves due to rapid thermally induced tissue expansion.
For the treatment of tattoos and pigmented lesions, lasers such as Nd:YAG lasers are generally used.
Figure 12.26 shows photographs depicting the efﬁcacy of laser treatment for tattoo removal. However,

different tattoo inks may absorb the laser energy differently, with the result that laser treatment may not
completely remove the tattoo in some cases.
12.6.3
Hair Removal
In the case of laser treatment for hair removal by selective photothermolysis, melanin in the hair follicles
is the chosen chromophore. Since the base of hair follicles is 2–7 mm below the surface of the skin, red
and infrared wavelengths are used for treatment. Diode lasers emitting at around 800 nm and Nd:YAG
lasers emitting at 1064 nm are commonly used for the purpose. Since the thermal relaxation time of hair
follicles is in the range of several milliseconds to about 100 ms, the chosen pulse width normally falls
within the range 1–50 ms.
An important factor to consider in selective photothermolysis of hair follicles is that the epidermis also
contains melanin. One of the treatment approaches can be to make use of differential amounts of high
melanin content in hair follicles as in dark-coloured hair and low melanin content in pale skin. The other
approach is through appropriate selection of pulse duration, making use of different thermal relaxation
times of hair follicles (up to 100 ms) and the epidermis (up to 50 ms). Figure 12.27 shows a photograph
illustrating the efﬁcacy of laser treatment for the removal of unwanted hair.

Lasers for Dermatology
Possible types of lasers that have found applications in dermatology include CO2 lasers, Nd:YAG and
Er:YAG lasers, diode lasers, argon lasers, Alexandrite lasers and pulsed dye lasers.
CO2 laser energy is absorbed by water, and it can be used as a focused or defocused laser. The focused
laser is used for treating acne scars, chickenpox scars, ﬁne lines, wrinkles and sun damage. The
defocused mode is used to remove skin tags, dermatosis papulosa nigra, warts, syringomas, moles,
seborrhoeic keratosis, milia and sebaceous hyperplasia.
Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers are used for blue tattoos, deep tattoos and dermal pigmented lesions.
Frequency-doubled Nd:YAG lasers emitting at 532 nm are used for superﬁcial brown lesions, solar
lentigenes, freckles and red/orange tattoos. Er:YAG lasers emitting at 2940 nm are used for the treatment
of wrinkles, acne scars and pre-cancerous lesions.
Short-pulse dye lasers emitting in the visible band are used to treat vascular lesions such as like
portwine stains, naevus ﬂemmus, hemangiomas, keloids and hypertrophic scars. Long-pulse dye lasers
are used to treat ﬁne veins, telangiectasia and blushing.
Diode lasers are usually preferred for the removal of brown and black hair. GaAlAs diode lasers
emitting at 810 nm are found be very effective on dark skin.
Alexandrite lasers emitting at 755 nm are used for the removal of tattoos and benign lesions. Long-
pulse Alexandrite lasers are used for hair removal.
Argon lasers emitting at 488 nm and 514 nm due to their absorption in pigments like haemoglobin and
melanin are used to treat skin diseases like A-V malformations, Hemangiomas, ﬁne veins, spider nevi
and acne rosacea.
12.7
Laser Dentistry
Although the dental drill continues to be the most widely used mechanism of caries removal and the
related processes, the laser holds tremendous potential to make cavity preparation, caries removal and
other associated operations a less painful treatment. In addition, laser treatment offers the potential of
minimally invasive caries removal and is also a methodology to treat inaccessible areas without
adversely affecting the healthy tissue. Common present and potential future applications of laser
dentistry include caries removal and the related operations of sterilization, conditioning and curing of
ﬁllings. Other areas where laser ﬁnds application in dentistry include endodontics involving root canal
preparation and disinfection, periodontics involving removal of calculi, disinfection of implants therapy
and various types of soft tissue surgery. Lasers offer the possibility of using selective ablation for the
removal of caries from inaccessible areas without affecting surrounding tissue.
12.7.1
Considerations in Laser Dentistry
The process of caries removal involves the removal of affected tissue and its replacement by a ﬁlling
material. During the removal of affected tissue, a geometrical cavity is prepared to ensure better adhesion
of the ﬁlling material to the cavity. The conventional method of cavity preparation and caries removal
involves use of a high-speed turbine. This is a source of discomfort due to vibrations, noise and pain;
treatment by laser largely overcomes these problems. Laser dentistry also eliminates many of the more
serious problems of high-speed drills, including cracks in the teeth from the vibration caused by the
rapidly turning heat-producing drill bit. This can weaken the teeth and cause even more problems. With
laser treatment, an extremely narrow focused stream of laser energy gently and precisely removes a wide
range of damaged tissue much like a drill, but without the noise, vibration, heat and even anaesthesia in
most cases.
However, to make laser treatment procedure as painless as possible, thermal and mechanical side
effects have to be minimized. For this, laser absorption should be high enough to conﬁne the heating to
the surface. Laser irradiance also needs to be higher than the micro-explosive ablation threshold at an
acceptable ablation rate and lower than the value that causes shock waves and interfering repulsion.
Laser energy is generally combined with a spray of cool water to gently cut teeth and even bone without
Lasers in Medicine
453

generating heat, vibration or shock. Figure 12.28 illustrates one such system with its laser/water stream
delivery probe.
Laser-assisted caries removal opens up the possibility of treating inaccessible areas. To enable this,
laser therapy relies on the intrinsic selective ablation and feedback control. Intrinsic selective ablation is
possible if ablation threshold of caries were lower than that of surrounding healthy tissue. A Q-switched
frequency-doubled Alexandrite laser has been used to clinically demonstrate this concept. The
associated disadvantages however are lower ablation rates and the need to ﬁre the laser even if there
is no caries to ablate, resulting in heating of tissue.
Use of feedback control is the other option which can overcome some of the problems mentioned
above. In this approach, ﬂuorescence spectroscopy is used for detection of caries and calculi. After
detection, a thin burr is used to create an opening for inserting a thin optical ﬁbre to guide the laser
radiation to the treatment site. The ﬂuorescence detection is used to control laser irradiance. The laser is
made to ﬁre pulses only when the ﬂuorescence feedback signal exceeds a certain pre-determined
threshold indicating decay. This method therefore eliminates the need for visual information about the
treatment site.
The Key-3 laser dentistry system conﬁgured around a pulsed Er:YAG laser from M/s KaVo, USA uses
feedback control, which ensures that the laser energy is used exactly as much as is necessary for the
treatment. Figure 12.29 illustrates the system.
12.7.2
Lasers for Dentistry
Commonly used laser types for dentistry are Er:YAG laser (2.94 mm), Er:YSGG laser (erbium-doped
yttrium scandium gallium garnet, 2.97 mm), Ho:YAG laser (holmium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet,
2.1 mm), CO2 laser (9.6 mm) and excimer laser (193 nm).

454
Lasers and Optoelectronics

An Er:YAG laser is important as its emission wavelength exactly matches the absorption peak of water
molecules. A free-running Er:YAG laser with pulse duration and pulse energy of the order of 0.3 ms and
100 mJ respectively is used. Thermomechanical ablation is the relevant effect; the process leaves a
roughness in the cavity walls without affecting the dentine underlying the enamel. This is due to the
relatively greater strength and reduced water content of the dentine. An Er:YSGG laser also produces
comparable results.
A CO2 laser with its emission wavelength tuned to 9.6 mm is also suitable for caries removal due to its
spectral match with the mid-infrared absorption spectrum of inorganic microcrystals, mainly hydroxy-
apatite (HAP). It may be mentioned here that HAP determines the stability and strength of hard tissue
bone, dentine and enamel. HP and water determine the absorption characteristics of tissue. An excimer
laser emitting at 193 nm is another potential candidate, as the wavelength is highly absorbed by HAP.
Picosecond and femtosecond lasers are other prospective lasers. Ultra-short-pulse lasers have
associated thermal and mechanical side effects. Of the above-mentioned laser types, Er:YAG continues
to be the most preferred laser for dentistry.

Vascular Surgery
12.8.1
Conventional Treatment of Angioplasty: PTA
Laser angioplasty is better understood if we are familiar with the background of conventional
angioplasty, also known as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). PTA is a well-established
clinical procedure used for treatment of atheromatous occlusive disease, a condition that refers to the
narrowing or occlusion of arterial lumens by plaque made up of free cholesterol, a type of inﬂammatory
cell ﬁlled with fat and ﬁbrous tissue. The narrowing or occlusion of coronary and carotid arteries due to
accumulation of these plaques manifests as angina. Rupturing of the plaque coupled with thrombosis can
lead to myocardial infarcts and strokes.
In PTA, a ﬁne wire is inserted into the arterial lumen through a needle inserted into the artery, usually
the femoral artery in the groin. The wire is guided to the point in the artery where it is narrowed by plaque
under X-ray guidance. The wire is passed through the narrowed segment of the artery. A thin ﬂexible
plastic tube called canula is passed over the guide wire and an angiogram is taken to conﬁrm the extent of
Figure 12.29

Lasers in Medicine
455

the narrowing of the artery. After the angiography is performed, the canula is removed and replaced by an
undilated balloon catheter slid over the guide wire. Dilatation of the balloon pushes the atheroma into the
wall of the artery, thereby opening the lumen to blood ﬂow. Figure 12.30 illustrates the different steps
involved in the PTA procedure.
Although very effective for a partial blockage of the arteries, it is not suitable for complete occlusions
mainly due to the inability to pass the guide wire through the occlusion. A good percentage of patients
having undergone PTA treatment suffer from recurrent arterial blockage, a condition known as
restenosis, even after a successful PTA. This is overcome by placing a stent, a slotted metal mesh
tube, inside the artery during the PTA procedure. An unexpanded stent mounted on the angioplasty
balloon is introduced using a guide wire and aligned with the lesion. The stent expands and becomes
embedded into the lesion on inﬂation of the balloon. The balloon is deﬂated and subsequently withdrawn
along with the guide wire. The diameter of the vessel increases. Stenting signiﬁcantly reduces the
probability of restenosis. The PTA and stenting procedure is diagrammatically shown in Figure 12.31.
12.8.2
Laser Angioplasty
Laser angioplasty is the procedure by which an occluded artery is opened with laser energy delivered
through a ﬁbre-optic probe. Laser angioplasty offers a non-surgical alternative to cleansing of clogged
arteries with extraordinary precision. The PTA and stenting procedure described in the previous section
is best suited for treatment of discrete atherosclerotic stenoses. The success rate of the PTA procedure is
however much lower in patients suffering from diffuse atherosclerotic disease and total occlusions, and
PTA is also plagued by a high restenosis rate. Laser angioplasty addresses these limitations. In contrast to
the PTA procedure where plaque is either compressed or displaced, laser angioplasty ablates the plaque.
This allows treatment of previously untreatable lesions and also signiﬁcantly reduces restenosis rate.
With laser angioplasty, it is feasible to pass a ﬁbre-optic catheter through the entire length of coronary
circulation and vaporize all atherosclerotic plaque along the arterial wall.
Laser angioplasty is similar to balloon angioplasty with the balloon-tipped catheter replaced by a
laser-tipped catheter. A ﬂexible catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin. The catheter is directed
under X-ray guidance to thread into the blocked coronary artery. Laser light is delivered through multiple
ﬁbre-optic bundles within the catheter. The area of plaque build-up is vaporized by ﬁring short bursts of
laser radiation using an excimer laser. Ultraviolet light is much cooler than infrared laser radiation, and
so reduces the risk of damaging surrounding tissue. Figure 12.32 illustrates the use of a laser for
angioplasty procedure.
12.9
Photodynamic Therapy
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the use of photosensitizer drugs which, on activation by light of
appropriate wavelength and intensity, produce photoproducts that can destroy diseased cells or tissues in
the presence of oxygen. The drugs are usually administered intravenously. In the case of skin diseases,

catheter; and (c) withdrawal of guide wire with balloon catheter.

457

drug administration is by topical application. The photosensitizer is allowed to accumulate in the target
tissue or organism over a period of time that could range from minutes to days. The light radiation
irradiates the local site of the disease leading to activation of the photosensitizer, which is then followed
by generation of photoproducts that destroy the targeted cells or tissue. Clinically approved photo-
sensitizer drugs that are presently in use for treatment of solid tumours, tumours of hollow organs,
premalignant tissues, macular degeneration and certain types of skin damage include photofrin, mTHPC,
AlPcS4, 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX). For most photosensitizer agents
in clinical use or under investigation, the active photoproduct is mainly the excited singlet state of
molecular oxygen (1O2).
12.9.1
Important Considerations
The efﬁcacy of PDT depends upon many factors including the properties of the photosensitizer, the
characteristics of the light source and its delivery mechanism, the photobiological response of the cells
and tissue, and the optical technologies used for treatment monitoring.
With reference to light source, important considerations include intensity, wavelength and spatial
proﬁle. While the intensity and wavelength should be appropriate in order to cause efﬁcient photo-
sensitizer activation in an acceptable treatment time, the spatial proﬁle should match the tissue geometry.
Different types of sources of light that are currently in use include high-brightness lamps with
appropriate ﬁlters, LED arrays and CW and high-repetition-rate pulsed lasers. Lasers are of particular
signiﬁcance as they can be efﬁciently coupled into ﬁbre-optic cables. Fibre-optic delivery facilitates light
delivery into the body either endoscopically or interstitially with the ﬁbre-optic cable inserted directly
into tissues through needles. The wavelength band of interest is 630–800 nm. Output power levels used
for treatment are in the range 1–5 W.
Argon ion lasers were used earlier up until the 1980s. They were replaced by frequency-doubled
Nd:YAG lasers in the late 1980s. A high-repetition-rate Nd:YAG short-pulse laser is photobiologically
equivalent to a CW laser power with the same average power. Due to the high cost and relatively bigger
size and weight, they have largely been replaced by CW diode lasers.
While using non-laser sources such as LEDs and lamps, a very important consideration is the degree of
overlap between the light source emission and the photosensitizer activation spectra. Since the spectral
width of a non-laser source is relatively much larger than that of a laser source, the non-laser source
would necessarily be of a higher output power rating than a laser source for a given treatment job.
An important requirement of a light delivery system is to efﬁciently transport light to the target tissue
and to distribute it to match the 2D or 3D geometry of the tissue. A multimode ﬁbre is generally used with
a simple lens system attached to a ﬁbre tip to achieve the desired spatial proﬁle. A scanning laser beam is
used in the case of treatment of retinal diseases by PDT.
Monitoring of PDT treatment is yet another critical requirement. The parameters of interest include
tissue irradiance, photosensitizer concentration and tissue oxygenation before, during and after the PDT.
Tissue irradiance may be measured with the help of ﬁbre-optic probes with a modiﬁed tip to offer a near-
isotropic response. Fluorescence or diffused reﬂectance spectroscopy is generally used for non-invasive
in vivo measurement of photosensitizer concentration. Both optical and non-optical probes are used for
measurement of tissue oxygenation.
12.9.2
Applications of PTD
As outlined earlier, PDT is a method of treatment of localized tumours by prior administration of
photosensitizer drug in the presence of oxygen. One of the key features of this treatment is that the
connective elements such as collagen and elastin are largely unaffected, which ensures that
the mechanical integrity of a hollow organ is maintained. Also, PDT-treated areas heal with more
regeneration and less scarring. It is a localized treatment and can be considered to be safe despite the fact
that, in the case of intravenous administration, the photosensitizer reaches every part of the body. If
acting alone, neither of the photosensitizer or the light dose produce any effect. This allows the boundary
of the tissue to be treated to be deﬁned with an acceptable degree of selectivity. PDT is currently in use
458
Lasers and Optoelectronics

for treatment of tumours in hollow organs, including areas of pre-cancerous change in hollow organs, and
treatment of tumours in solid organs including skin tumours.
PDT is particularly suited to treatment of localized cancers of hollow organs that have not spread
beyond the wall of the organ. For example, localized cancers of the mouth have been effectively treated
by PDT with porﬁmer sodium, a puriﬁed form of HpD, and mTHPC used as photosensitizer agents.
PDT is particularly attractive for treatment of such cancers as the possibility of cosmetic or functional
impairment resulting from other forms of treatment may be unacceptable to most patients. It also suits
patients who are otherwise not ﬁt for surgery. Since normal bones are highly resistant to PDT, treatment
of mouth cancers that have invaded the upper or lower jaw is also possible without adversely affecting the
normal bone.
PDT is also an attractive alternative to surgery for patients suffering from localized cancers of the
gastrointestinal tract and major airways if found unﬁt for surgery. Superﬁcial skin tumours such as basal
cell carcinomas can be effectively treated by PDT using ALA photosensitizer. ALA is a naturally
occurring substance that leads to the generation of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX), which is a photosensitizer.
It is converted to haem, which is an essential substance in all nucleated cells. ALA can be administered
through the mouth, produces clinically useful levels of PPIX in 3–6 hours and is cleared from the body in
about 24 hours.
Although better established for the treatment of hollow organs and skin cancers, PDT has also been
used for the treatment of lesions of solid organs. Because of the fact that connective tissues are not
adversely affected by PDT, it is being considered for treatment of some common cancers such as those of
lungs, pancreas and prostrate. A ﬂexible endoscope may be used for light delivery in the case of small
tumours of major airways. Where airways are too small for endoscopic access, treatment is by interstitial
PDT. In this case, the ﬁbre is inserted through the skin up to the cancer site under image guidance.
Prostrate and pancreas cancers have reportedly been treated using the mTHPC photosensitizer agent.
PDT has also been exploited as additional therapy to conventional surgery to destroy small tumour
deposits that may be invisible to the surgeon or those involving vital structures not desirable to be cut
or removed.
12.10
Thermal Therapy
Photochemical and photothermal are the two most widely exploited light–tissue interaction mechanisms
for the treatment of both benign and malignant cancers. While photodynamic therapy discussed in the
previous section is based on the photochemical effects of light–tissue interaction, thermal therapy makes
use of the photothermal effect. The efﬁcacy of thermal therapy depends upon the amount of thermal
energy delivered to the target tissue, the time over which it is delivered and the volume of the tissue in
which it is absorbed.
Thermal therapy ﬁnds extensive use in general surgery for bloodless cutting, treatment of haemor-
rhages in peptic ulcers and cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, lungs and oesophagus. It is also used for
treatment of lesions of external genitalia.
Commonly used lasers in thermal therapy include CO2 lasers, Nd:YAG lasers and diode lasers,
emitting at 10 600 nm, 1064 nm and 630–900 nm, respectively. Both Nd:YAG and diode lasers are used
in conjunction with ﬁbre-optic delivery. In the following sections we discuss common therapeutic
applications of thermal therapy.
12.10.1
Treatment of Haemorrhages of Peptic Ulcers
Peptic ulcer condition can be best managed using a combination of pharmacologic, endoscopic and
surgical treatment procedures. The management of peptic ulcer bleeding in the last couple of decades has
beneﬁted immensely from the advent of endoscopic haemostasis and potent acid suppressing agents. A
combination of pharmacologic and endoscopic therapy is the best treatment for patients suffering from
active bleeding ulcers. Although the best way to control bleeding, surgical interventions should only be
considered after other treatment procedures have failed.
Lasers in Medicine
459

Endoscopic treatment therapy including injection therapy, thermal coagulation and mechanical
haemostasis are widely established treatment procedures for upper gastrointestinal bleeding. Most
clinical trials have demonstrated the efﬁcacy of endoscopic therapy in reducing both recurrent bleeding
in peptic ulcers and also the need for surgical intervention. Injection therapy involves injections with
solutions of diluted epinephrine (1:10 000) and a sclera therapy needle. Solutions of other agents such as
poliodocanol, saline and dextrose are equally effective. Mechanical therapy is mainly used for the
treatment of variceal haemorrhage and rarely in the treatment of peptic ulcers.
Thermal therapy is the most widely used treatment procedure for endoscopic haemostasis. Thermal
therapy is further classiﬁed as contact and non-contact. Contact thermal therapy may use a heater probe
or electro-coagulation. Non-contact therapy is mainly laser based; a relatively recent non-contact
technique is that of argon plasma coagulation. The haemostatic effects of contact therapy and laser-based
non-contact therapy are clinically well established. Laser-induced coagulation is based on the absorption
of laser energy by tissue proteins leading to rapid heating. In the case of a contact heat probe, heating is
through diffusion; in electro-coagulation, heat is produced by the passage of a high-frequency electrical
current through the tissue.
Lasers are very effective for direct coagulation of 0.25 mm arteries, but become less effective for
larger arteries. Laser light is focused on a bleeding point to induce rapid heating of tissue, which causes
blood coagulation and tissue necrosis. A Nd:YAG laser is widely used for the treatment as it offers higher
coagulation capacity and increased perforation potential.
12.10.2
Treatment of Cancer
The symptoms of cancers of the oesophagus and gastrointestinal tract usually manifest themselves in
the advanced stage of the disease, with the result that patients suffering from these cancers have
practically very little hope of cure. One of the major objectives of the therapy is to relieve the patient
of the pain and discomfort during the remaining life. Laser endoscopy therapy is a simple procedure
to help the patients achieve this objective, and an Nd:YAG laser is generally used for the purpose.
Endoscopic Nd:YAG laser canalization can be used in oesophageal cancers wherever there are visible
lumps of tumours. Laser therapy can be used to reduce the bulk of these lumps, particularly those
causing major obstruction. It can also be used to vaporize prominent or coagulate smaller nodules.
The deep penetration of laser prevents bleeding from underlying tissues. Radiotherapy can be used to
prolong a period of palliation.
Nd:YAG laser therapy plays a useful palliating role in patients suffering from lung cancer with
tumours obstructing major airways, especially when surgical intervention is not possible. The procedure
is more complicated and hazardous than in the case of gastrointestinal cancers; while temporary total
occlusion of the oesophagus is tolerable, this is not the case for the trachea. There is also a convenient
route for debris removal in the case of the gastrointestinal tract; again, this is not so for major airways. In
the case of laser therapy for treatment of lung cancer, a ﬂexible endoscope is inserted through a rigid
endoscope. As for oesophageal cancers, radiotherapy can be used as a follow-up treatment for
recanalization of major airways to extend the palliation period.
CO2 and Nd:YAG lasers have also been effectively used to treat lesions of external genitalia such as
warts and superﬁcial penile cancer. Endoscopy treatment has also been used for the treatment of bladder
tumours. Both laser coagulation and electro-coagulation can be used, although laser therapy offers
higher precision and better control. It may be mentioned here that treatment of bladder tumours can be
managed in the early stage of the disease; bladder tumours usually bleed into urine allowing early
detection unlike cancers of the oesophagus and lungs that are detected quite late.
12.11
Summary
 Medical applications of lasers are classiﬁed as diagnostic and therapeutic applications. In the case of
diagnostic applications, the objective is to know about the pathology and physiology of the tissue
through its interaction with light photons. In the case of therapeutic applications, the objective is

permanent modiﬁcation of the tissue in question for treatment of the disease. The optical energy in this
case is absorbed by the tissue or an exogenous agent, which further leads to a photochemical,
photomechanical or photothermal process depending upon the rate at which the photon energy is
absorbed per unit volume of tissue.
 Fundamental mechanisms of light–tissue interaction include absorption, luminescence including
ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence and scattering including elastic and inelastic scattering.
 The processes of absorption, ﬂuorescence and phosphorescence are best illustrated in a Jablonski
diagram. A Jablonski diagram illustrates the electronic states of a molecule and its associated
transitions.
 Tissue optical properties of interest include absorption coefﬁcient, scattering coefﬁcient and scattering
phase function. Another important consideration is the propagation of light in the tissue. From the
viewpoint of biomedical diagnostics, it is important to measure the magnitude of absorption and
scattering coefﬁcients at the wavelength of interest and also their variation as a function of wavelength.
 From the viewpoint of therapeutic applications, the nature of light–tissue interaction can be either
photochemical, photothermal or photomechanical.
 Laser diagnostics or optical diagnostics in general is based on changes in one or more measurable
properties of light in the ultraviolet, visible or near-infrared wavelength bands as it transmits through
and/or reﬂects from tissues as a result of the interaction of light photons with tissue structure and
molecules.
 There are two broad categories of diagnostic techniques: in vivo and in vitro. In vivo diagnostic
techniques are either non-invasive or minimally invasive and are performed on a living organism, as
opposed to in vitro techniques that are used outside a living organism in a controlled environment.
 White light imaging is a type of reﬂectance imaging in which diagnosis is based on the spectral and
spatial appearance of the tissue in the visible range.
 Diffuse optical spectroscopic imaging is a non-invasive optical diagnostic technique that can quantify
the absorption and scattering coefﬁcients of tissues. Elastic scattering and absorption are the basis of
light–tissue interaction mechanisms responsible for most of the diagnostic applications.
 When light interacts with tissues, there is a near-180 backscattering that occurs at microscale
interfaces within tissues due to localized refractive index change. This forms the basis of optical
coherence tomography (OCT), enabling generation of high-resolution structural images. Confocal
imaging such as OCT is also used for high-resolution imaging of subsurface tissue structures.
 Fluorescence spectroscopy and imaging diagnostics is based on ﬂuorescence emission from
speciﬁc chromophores in tissue when excited by short wavelengths, usually in the blue or
ultraviolet range.
 Raman spectroscopy technique of medical diagnostics depends upon inelastic scattering occurring as a
result of light–tissue interaction. There are two forms of inelastic scattering: Stokes (where the photon
loses energy on interaction and the scattered photon has a longer wavelength) and anti-Stokes (where
the photon gains energy and is scattered at a shorter wavelength) scattering.
 Common therapeutic applications of lasers include their use in clinical procedures in ophthalmology,
dermatology, dentistry, vascular surgery, photodynamic therapy and thermal therapy.
 Different interaction mechanisms responsible for various treatment procedures in ophthalmology
include photocoagulation, photo-ablation, photodisruption and photodynamic therapy (PDT).
 In photocoagulation for the treatment of tumours, laser light in visible green wavelength is selectively
absorbed by haemoglobin, the pigment in red blood cells, to seal bleeding blood vessels. Applications
in ophthalmology include treatment of detached retina, destruction of abnormal blood vessels in retina
and treatment of tumours.
 Photo-ablation is volatilization of tissue by laser light in the deep ultraviolet wavelength band. It is
mainly used in corrective eye surgery such as LASIK, where it is used to remove tissues by
vaporization by transferring the energy to the target area. Corneal shaping is used to correct the
refractive power of the eye.
 Photodisruption is the disruption of tissues by laser-induced rapid ionization of molecules. It is an
established method for treatment of post-cataract membranes.
Lasers in Medicine

 PDT involves the use of photosensitizer drugs which, on activation by light of appropriate wavelength
and intensity, produce photoproducts that can destroy diseased cells or tissue in the presence of
oxygen. The drugs are usually administered intravenously. In the case of skin diseases, drug
administration is by topical application. PDT is particularly suited to the treatment of localized
cancers of hollow organs that have not spread beyond the wall of the organ.
 Thermal therapy exploits the photothermal effect. The efﬁcacy of thermal therapy depends upon the
amount of thermal energy delivered to the target tissue, the time for which it is delivered and the
volume of the tissue in which it is absorbed. Thermal therapy ﬁnds extensive use in general surgery for
bloodless cutting, treatment of haemorrhages in peptic ulcers and cancers of gastrointestinal tract,
lungs and oesophagus. It is also used for treatment of lesions of external genitalia.
 Dermatological applications of laser therapy make use of the photothermal effect. Some common
applications of laser therapy in dermatology include laser treatment of cutaneous vascular lesions such
as portwine stains (PWS), treatment of pigmented lesions and tattoos and hair removal.
 Common applications of laser dentistry include caries removal and the related operations of
sterilization, conditioning and curing of ﬁllings. Other areas where the laser ﬁnds application in
dentistry include endodontics involving root canal preparation and disinfection, periodontics involv-
ing removal of calculi, disinfection of implants therapy and various types of soft tissue surgery.
 Laser angioplasty is the procedure by which an occluded artery is opened with laser energy delivered
through a ﬁbre-optic probe. Laser angioplasty offers a non-surgical alternative to cleansing of clogged
arteries with extraordinary precision.

Lasers in Science and Technology
13.1
Introduction
Since their inception in the 1960s, lasers have been used in industry (Chapter 11), in medicine (Chapter
12) and in defence for a host of applications from target ranging and designation to tracking and imaging
and from electro-optic countermeasures to their use as directed-energy weapons. In addition to these
more visible applications of lasers, there are many important areas where lasers have been used in pursuit
of science and technology. Some of the important areas include their use in optical metrology, mainly
exploiting laser interferometry for making precise engineering measurements such as length, velocity,
vibration, stress and strain; in Earth and environmental sciences for the remote sensing of Earth’s
environment and satellite laser ranging, contributing to geodetic studies such as determining the
variation of Earth’s centre of mass, detection of Earth and ocean tides, modelling temporal and spatial
variation of Earth’s gravity ﬁeld and related studies; in astronomy such as in the use of the laser guide
star technique in astronomical telescopes; and laser holography, which has a wide range of applications
in industry, medical diagnostics and optical computing. We discuss some of these topics in detail in this
chapter.
13.2
Optical Metrology
As a source of electromagnetic radiation with exceptionally high frequency stability, a laser is the basis
of length/distance metrology. Optical frequency metrology allows high-precision measurements of
optical frequencies, the atomic clock being an example. Laser interferometry is at the core of length
metrology, measurement of time-of-ﬂight of laser pulses being the other commonly used technique.
Interferometric techniques such as self-heterodyne interferometers are used for the measurement of
wavelength and line width. The measurement of temperature is another common application. In the
following sections, beginning with an overview of interferometers (which form the basis of many
engineering measurements), the concepts of measurement of length/distance, frequency, wavelength and
line width and ﬁnally temperature are brieﬂy described. Other related topics such as laser velocimetry,
laser vibrometry and electron speckle pattern interferometry are discussed in Sections 13.3–13.5.
13.2.1
Interferometers
An interferometer is an optical device that makes use of the interference phenomenon. An optical beam
is split into two separate beams travelling two different paths before they are recombined to produce an
interference pattern. Beam splitters/combiners are used for the purpose. Certain interferometers use a
common beam path but different polarizations, which makes them immune to measurement errors
caused by geometric path length ﬂuctuations. In the more common types of interferometers, while

travelling through their designated paths the two beams are subjected to some external inﬂuences such as
a variation in refractive index of the medium and path length differences caused by the parameter under
measurement. The interference pattern is then analyzed for the intended measurement.
A number of interferometers have been developed over the years for various applications. Some
common types include the Michelson interferometer, the Twyman–Green interferometer, the Mach–
Zehnder interferometer, the Fabry–Perot interferometer and the Sagnac interferometer. All these
interferometers can be implemented with both free-space optics as well as ﬁbre optics. In ﬁbre optic
interferometers, ﬁbre couplers replace beam splitters. With ﬁbre optic interferometers, the potential
difﬁculties posed by a change in polarization state while propagating through the ﬁbre and optical phase
shifts caused by temperature ﬂuctuations have to be addressed. The different interferometers mentioned
above are brieﬂy described in the following sections.
13.2.1.1
Michelson Interferometer
The Michelson interferometer, invented by Albert Abraham Michelson, uses a single beam splitter
for separating and combining the beams as shown in the basic schematic arrangement of Figure 13.1a.
Figure 13.1
Michelson interferometer: (a) mirror-based schematic; and (b) retro-reﬂector-based schematic.
Lasers in Science and Technology
467

In this basic arrangement, if two mirrors were aligned for exact perpendicular incidence, only output
from mirror M2 would be accessible and the other output (from mirror M1) would go back to the light
source. If optical feedback to the source is undesirable and/or this output was also required, simple
mirrors with slightly non-normal incidence or retro-reﬂectors instead of simple mirrors as shown in
Figure 13.1b can be used. The use of retro-reﬂectors has the added advantage that the interferometer
becomes insensitive to slight misalignments.
A constructive or destructive interference pattern results from a non-zero path length difference. If a
white light source is used in the interferometer, it is necessary that the path length difference between the
two beams is precisely zero. In the case of a monochromatic source of light such as a laser, the path
length difference needs only to be less than the coherence length of the light source. A Michelson
interferometer is a very useful optical tool for the measurement of wavelength, distance, refractive index
and coherence length of optical beams.
13.2.1.2
Twyman–Green Interferometer
The Twyman–Green interferometer introduced by Frank Twyman and Arthur Green is essentially an
adaptation of the Michelson interferometer. While the Michelson interferometer may use a broadband
white light source or a laser, the Twyman–Green interferometer essentially uses a monochromatic point
source of light. It is used for characterizing optical elements such as lenses, prisms and ﬂats. Figure 13.2
shows the basic optical schematic of the interferometer to be used for characterizing lenses and other
curved surfaces. As shown in the diagram, light from the point laser source is ﬁrst collimated into a
parallel beam. The collimated beam is then split into two paths with the help of a beam splitter. The
optical component such as a lens under test is placed in one of the arms.
If testing a lens component, a convex spherical mirror with its centre of curvature coinciding with the
focus of the lens being tested constitutes the other end component. The emergent beam is recorded by an
imaging system for analysis. The fringe pattern is analyzed to test the quality of the optical component.
To test optical ﬂats, the component under test is the end component and a reference ﬂat is used in the
reference arm. To test prisms, the prism under test is placed in the path of the probe beam.
13.2.1.3
Mach–Zehnder Interferometer
The Mach–Zehnder interferometer developed by Ludwig Mach and Ludwig Zehnder is an optical tool
used to determine the relative phase shift between two collimated beams from a coherent light source.
Figure 13.2
Twyman–Green interferometer for testing lenses or curved surfaces.
468
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Figure 13.3 shows the optical schematic of the interferometer. Compared to the Michelson interferome-
ter which employs a single beam splitter for splitting and recombination of the beams, a Mach–Zehnder
interferometer uses two separate beam splitters: one for splitting the light beam from the light source into
two different paths and the other to combine the two beams.
The beam splitter BS1 splits the light beam usually equally into two paths. Part of the beam reﬂected
towards the fully reﬂecting mirror M1 (path A) undergoes a phase shift corresponding to l/2 at the
reﬂecting surface of mirror M1. It then travels towards beam splitter BS2 and is further divided into two
parts, one reaching detector D1 and the other reaching detector D2 after reﬂection from the reﬂecting
surface of beam splitter BS2. Beam splitter BS2 does not introduce any phase shift at its reﬂecting
surface. Also, part of the beam of path A reaching detector D2 undergoes a phase shift of twice the path
length in beam splitter BS2 and that reaching detector D1 corresponding to the single path length in beam
splitter BS2.
Part of the main beam transmitted towards the fully reﬂecting mirror M2 (path B) undergoes a phase
shift corresponding to l/2 at the reﬂecting surface of mirror M2 and also at the reﬂecting surface of beam
splitter BS2 before reaching detector D1. The part of the path B beam reaching detector D2 undergoes a
phase shift corresponding to a single path length in beam splitter BS2.
The combined beam reaching detector D1 therefore has contributions from path A and path B and the
components are in phase. On the other hand, the combined beam reaching detector D2 also has two
components which arrive at detector D2 out of phase. This leads to constructive interference at detector
D1 and destructive interference at detector D2. This will be true regardless of wavelength. If a sample is
introduced in either of the two paths, the phase shift introduced by the sample alters the phase
relationships between the two beams. Measuring the relative amount of light entering detector D1 and
detector D2 allows computation of the phase shift introduced by the sample.
13.2.1.4
Fabry–Perot Interferometer
The Fabry–Perot interferometer, developed by Charles Fabry and Alfred Perot, consists of two parallel
optical ﬂats with partially reﬂecting mirror surfaces facing each other. The ﬂats in an interferometer have

an anti-reﬂection coating and are often made in a wedge shape to prevent the rear surfaces from
producing interference fringes. The monolithic version of the interferometer, also referred to as an
etalon, consists of a transparent plate with two reﬂecting surfaces. The transmission spectrum of the
interferometer exhibits peaks corresponding to certain wavelengths. A Fabry–Perot interferometer
differs from a Fabry–Perot etalon in that it allows the distance d between the plates to be ﬁne tuned to
make transmission peaks correspond to the desired wavelength. Since transmission is angle dependent,
the peaks can also be shifted by rotating the etalon with respect to the beam. Figure 13.4 illustrates the
operational principle of a Fabry–Perot interferometer or etalon.
In both cases, whether interferometer or etalon, the changing transmission function is produced by
interference between the multiple reﬂections that take place between the two reﬂecting surfaces. There is
constructive interference if the transmitted beams are in phase, leading to a transmission peak or
maxima. If the transmitted beams are out of phase, destructive interference produces a transmission
minima. The phase relationship between the transmitted beams that ultimately determines the spectral
response of the interferometer or etalon depends upon wavelength l; refractive index n of the material
between the two reﬂecting surfaces; distance d between the two reﬂecting surfaces; and the angle u at
which light travels in the space between the reﬂecting surfaces. The condition of maxima is deﬁned by
ml ¼ 2nd cos u, where m is the order of interference.
Important parameters characterizing the interferometer or etalon include free spectral range Dl, full-
width half-maximum (FWHM), spectral width dl of transmission peak and ﬁnesse F. The free spectral
range is deﬁned as the wavelength separation between two adjacent peaks, and is given by:
Dl ¼
l2
0
2nd cos u þ l0
ﬃ
l2
0
2nd cos u.
where l0 is the centre wavelength of the nearest transmission peak. Finesse F is deﬁned as the ratio of
free spectral range to FWHM spectral width, and is approximated by
F ¼ mpR1=2
1  R
for R > 0.5 where R is the reﬂectance of the two reﬂecting surfaces. FWHM spectral width can be
computed from known values of ﬁnesse and free spectral range. Figure 13.5 illustrates the important
parameters with the help of a typical transmission spectrum plotted for two different values of ﬁnesse. As
is evident from the curves, higher ﬁnesse shows sharper transmission peaks with lower minimum
transmission coefﬁcients. For a given value of ﬁnesse, the wavelength resolution can be improved by
increasing distance d, but only at the cost of reducing free spectral range.
Figure 13.4
Fabry–Perot interferometer.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Some of the common applications of the Fabry–Perot interferometer include: laser resonator design,
where an etalon with appropriate values of ﬁnesse and free spectral range can be used to suppress all
cavity modes except one hence transforming it from a multimode laser into a single-mode laser; laser
absorption spectrometry where Fabry–Perot etalons are used to increase the interaction length; dichroic
ﬁlters, sources, cameras and astronomical equipment; telecommunications using wavelength division
multiplexing; and optical wave meters.
13.2.1.5
Sagnac Interferometer
The Sagnac interferometer, named after the French physicist George Sagnac, is based on what is known
as the Sagnac effect. According to the Sagnac effect, when a ring laser comprising two counter-
propagating laser beams is rotated around an axis perpendicular to the plane of the ring laser, the light
beam travelling in the same direction as the direction of rotation experiences a longer path length while
the light beam travelling in the opposite direction experiences a shorter path length in one round-trip.
This produces a relative phase shift between the two counter-propagating beams due to the two light
beams travelling different path lengths with the magnitude of phase shift being proportional to the
rotation rate.
Figure 13.6 shows the optical schematic of a Sagnac interferometer using a square geometry.
Triangular geometry is the widely used ring laser geometry. The beam splitter splits the beam into
two counter-propagating laser beams. After recombination, the two beams produce a fringe pattern that
can be analyzed to compute the rotation rate. One of the most widely exploited applications of Sagnac
interferometers is in a ring laser gyroscope used in inertial navigation systems. The Sagnac effect and
ring laser gyro are discussed in detail in Chapter 14 on military applications.
13.2.2
Length Metrology
Lasers offer a non-contact methodology for precise measurement of distances and displacements.
Applications range from architecture to scientiﬁc studies and from forensics to defence. There are a
number of concepts that have been put to use for determining distances, each with its merits and
shortcomings, for a given application or set of applications. Most laser-based methods of determining
distances and displacements include the time-of-ﬂight method, the phase shift method, the triangulation
method, the frequency modulation method and interferometry.
In the time-of-ﬂight technique, the distance to an object is determined by measuring time-of-ﬂight of a
narrow laser pulse to travel to the targeted object and return after reﬂection. This method is particularly
Figure 13.5
Transmission spectrum of Fabry–Perot interferometer.
Lasers in Science and Technology
471

suited to measurement of relatively larger distances ranging from hundreds of metres to tens of
kilometres, with a typical range accuracy of a few metres.
The phase shift technique of range ﬁnding describes how the laser beam with sinusoidal power
modulation is transmitted towards the target and the diffused or specular reﬂection from the target is
received. The target distance is determined from the phase of the received laser beam compared to the
transmitted laser beam. The phase shift is 2p times the product of time-of-ﬂight and modulation
frequency. This allows us to compute the time-of-ﬂight and hence the distance to the target from known
values of phase shift and modulation frequency.
In the triangulation method, the laser transmitter, laser receiver and the intended object form a
triangle. The distance to the target is determined from known values of the distance between the
transmitter and receiver and measured angles between the lines joining the transmitter and the receiver,
the transmitter and the object and the receiver and the object. This method is capable of measuring
distances from millimetres to kilometres.
For the frequency modulation method, the frequency of a narrow-line-width laser is modulated with a
ramp or sinusoidal signal and then transmitted towards to the target. The received signal corresponding to
reﬂected laser beam, specular or diffused, is mixed with the reference signal representing the transmitted
laser beam. The beat frequency produced as a result of homodyne detection is used to derive the distance
information.
The interferometry method is particularly suited to the measurement of changes in distance rather
than absolute value. It is capable of measuring distances to an accuracy better than the wavelength of
light used. Interferometers have been discussed in detail in Section 13.2.1.
These methods are discussed at length in Chapter 14 on military applications.
13.2.3
Time and Frequency Metrology
It is important for a variety of applications to determine both the frequency difference between two
optical frequencies and also the absolute value of optical frequencies. Measurement of the absolute value
of an optical frequency by ﬁrst measuring the wavelength (e.g. by a wavelength meter) and then
Figure 13.6
Sagnac interferometer.
472
Lasers and Optoelectronics

converting it to the corresponding frequency (by multiplying the reciprocal of wavelength by the velocity
of light in vacuum c) often does not meet the precision requirement. This is due to the fact that the
accuracy of measurement of wavelength is limited by effects such as wavelength distortions. For high-
accuracy frequency measurements, it is important to measure optical frequencies either directly or as a
difference between two optical frequencies related to a microwave reference. It may be mentioned here
that the base unit of time, that is, the second in the SI system of units, has also been deﬁned in terms of a
microwave frequency. According to the standard, 1 s ¼ 9 192 631 770 periods of radiation corresponding
to the transition between two hyperﬁne levels of the ground state of caesium-133 atom, thereby deﬁning
time standard with respect to 9.192 631 770 GHz reference.
The difference between two optical frequencies can be measured by making them beat on a
photodetector and comparing it to a microwave reference, provided the beat signal frequency is less
than a few tens of GHz. The measurement of the absolute value of optical frequencies is a relatively far
more complex task. One of the approaches experimented with earlier was to begin with a stable
microwave frequency reference linked to a caesium atomic clock and then generate higher-frequency
references through a frequency chain of oscillators. Higher-frequency references were connected to the
lower frequencies by recording the beat signal of higher frequencies with the harmonics of lower
frequencies, and then using the constancy of the beat signal to adjust the higher frequency in case of drift.
Devices such as Schottky diodes, non-linear crystals, metal-insulator-metal diodes and so on were used
to generate harmonics in different spectral regions.
One of the major limitations of the traditional frequency chain approach to generate frequency
references is that it allows frequency measurement around a single optical frequency, unlike the
frequency comb techniques that allow measurement over a wide spectral range. An optical frequency
comb technique has revolutionized the optical frequency metrology. An optical frequency comb is
simply an optical spectrum consisting of equidistant lines. Figure 13.7 shows the spectrum of a typical
optical frequency comb. One of the methods of generating a frequency comb is to use a single-frequency
continuous wave laser strongly driving an electro-optic modulator. A more commonly used technique for
the generation of broadband frequency combs is by using ultra-short-pulse mode-locked lasers. The
optical spectrum of the output of a mode-locked laser consists of discrete lines with an exactly constant
frequency spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency. Each frequency in the pulse train is an integer
multiple of the pulse repetition frequency. It may be mentioned here that the generation of a frequency
comb requires that the periodicity applies not only to the pulse envelopes, but that coherence between the
pulses is also required. Techniques such as self-referencing, commonly used to achieve this objective, are
not described here.
Such a frequency comb acts like an optical ruler. If the location of comb frequencies are precisely
known, unknown frequencies could be determined by measuring the frequency difference between the
Figure 13.7
Typical optical frequency comb.
Lasers in Science and Technology
473

unknown frequency and the nearest comb frequency. As mentioned above, the optical spectrum of the
mode-locked laser output is a comb of exactly equidistant lines. Such a frequency comb can be deﬁned
by two parameters: (1) the frequency spacing, which equals the pulse repetition frequency of the laser
frep; and (2) the absolute position speciﬁed in terms of carrier-envelope offset frequency, which is the rate
at which the peak of the carrier frequency slips from the peak of the pulse envelope on a pulse-to-pulse
basis. If the two parameters were related to a microwave frequency reference, all frequencies in the comb
would be precisely known.
The dotted line in the frequency spectrum of Figure 13.7 highlights the location of an unknown
frequency. As shown in the ﬁgure, absolute frequency can be measured by measuring the frequency
difference from either of the two adjoining comb frequencies. For measurement of unknown frequencies
over a wide range, the frequency comb needs to have as wide a bandwidth as possible.
13.2.3.1
Optical Clock
An optical clock derives its output from an ultra-stable optical frequency standard, offering an
exceptionally high precision that is far superior to the best-available caesium atomic clocks. Timing
precision of the order of 1015 can be achieved by averaging time of few seconds with optical frequency
standards, whereas the same precision with microwave clocks would only be achievable by averaging a
few hundreds of hours. An optical clock is predicted to replace the caesium clock as the fundamental
timing reference in the not-too-distant future.
Optical clockwork phase coherently relates a high optical frequency standard (typically in the range of
hundreds of terahertz) to a lower frequency (typically in the microwave frequency region between 1 and
100 GHz), thereby allowing processing by fast electronics. The optical clockwork relates an optical
frequency standard to an electronic standard such as that based on the caesium atomic clock.
As outlined in Section 13.2 on frequency metrology, an earlier technique of relating high optical
frequency to a lower microwave frequency involved use of frequency chains that were extremely
cumbersome and expensive to set up. The use of frequency combs generated by broadband mode-locked
lasers has made it possible to realize simpler optical clockworks. As outlined earlier, different
frequencies in a frequency comb are deﬁned by pulse repetition frequency and carrier-envelope offset
frequency. An optical frequency from an optical frequency standard can then be expressed as the sum of
certain integer multiple of pulse repetition frequency, carrier-envelope offset frequency and beat
frequency between the optical standard frequency and the adjacent frequency comb frequency. These
three components (pulse repetition frequency, beat frequency and carrier-envelope offset frequency) can
all be measured and processed with fast electronics. This makes it possible to phase-coherently compare
the optical frequency standard and the microwave frequency standard caesium clock, and therefore
correct the timing signal of the caesium atomic clock with the much higher stability of the optical
frequency standard.
Figure 13.8 shows the schematic arrangement of an optical clock with a carrier-envelope offset
frequency stabilization by an f  2f interferometer-based feedback loop. Generation of the three signals
that constitute an optical frequency from the optical frequency standard are evident in the schematic
diagram.
13.2.4
Measurement of Line Width
Line width of a laser is an indicator of the degree of its monochromaticity and is deﬁned as the width of its
optical spectrum measured typically as the full-width half-maximum (FWHM). Line width is strongly
related to temporal coherence of the laser, characterized by coherence length or coherence time. Lasers
with narrow line width ﬁnd use in a wide range of applications including ﬁbre optic communications,
spectroscopy, ﬁbre optic sensors and testing and measurement purposes. Laser line width can be
measured by a number of different methods, with their efﬁcacy depending upon the order of line width to
be measured.
In the case of multimode lasers with line widths of the order of 10 GHz or more, the conventional
diffraction-grating-based technique of optical spectrum analysis may be used. Another possible
474
Lasers and Optoelectronics

technique is to convert frequency ﬂuctuations to intensity ﬂuctuations, using a frequency discriminator
such as an unbalanced interferometer or a high-ﬁnesse reference cavity.
For single-frequency lasers with narrower line width, the self-heterodyne technique is often used. Line
width in this case is measured as a beat frequency between the frequency-shifted laser output and a
delayed version of it. Figure 13.9 shows the basic set-up. One portion of the laser beam is sent through a
long optical ﬁbre which provides the desired time delay. For self-heterodyne action, the two laser beams
being superimposed to generate the beat note should be essentially uncorrelated so that the output
spectrum becomes a simple self-convolution of the laser output spectrum. For this to happen, the induced
time delay in one of the paths should be larger than the coherence length of the laser. Another portion of
the laser beam is frequency-shifted by some tens of megahertz with an acousto-optic modulator (AOM).
Both beams are ﬁnally superimposed on a beam splitter, and the resulting beat note (centred at the AOM
frequency) is recorded with a photodetector. The laser line width is then retrieved from this beat note. In
Figure 13.8

the case of lasers with relatively much narrower line widths of the order of kilohertz or sub-kilohertz,
necessitating long time delays which are impractical to implement with single-pass ﬁbre loop, a shorter
time delay with sophisticated data processing or a recirculating ﬁbre loop can be used instead.
The method of recirculating ﬁbre loops for measurement of the laser line width of the order of sub-
kilohertz is an extension of the self-heterodyne line width measurement technique. The long time delay
needed at line widths in the sub-kilohertz range is provided by a moderately long recirculating ﬁbre loop.
Figure 13.10 shows the basic measurement set-up.
In order to keep the light from different round-trips well separated, an AOM in the loop shifts the optical
frequency by about 100 MHz in each round-trip. On account of the fact that the frequency shift is much
larger than the line width, the components corresponding to different numbers of round trips are well
separated in the frequency domain. The beat notes of the original laser light with different frequency-
shifted components can be used to measure their line widths. The amplifying element in the loop
compensates for the losses in the ﬁbre and the AOM, which otherwise would limit the number of round-
trips possible. The sensitivity of the recirculating ﬁbre loop is limited by noise from the ﬁbre ampliﬁer.
Yet another approach of measuring line width is to measure the beat frequency note between the laser
under test and a reference laser operating at a nearby frequency. This method offers very high resolution.
Although conceptually very simple and reliable, the availability of a second laser operating at a nearby
frequency with the desired noise performance could be a difﬁcult proposition. Use of a frequency comb
source could facilitate measurement of line width over a wide spectral range.
13.2.5
Infrared Thermometer
Infrared thermometers allow non-contact measurement of an object’s temperature, therefore allowing
users to measure temperature in situation where use of conventional sensors would be either impossible
or highly impractical. An infrared thermometer in its most basic form consists of focusing optics that
focuses the received infrared energy onto a detector. It measures the temperature by detecting the
infrared energy emitted by the object and converting it into an equivalent electrical signal which, after
compensation for the ambient temperature, can be displayed in the units of temperature. Temperature is
computed from known values of the emitted infrared energy and the emissivity of the object.
It may be mentioned here that all materials at temperature above absolute zero emit infrared energy,
and the total energy emitted per unit surface area per unit time is directly proportional to fourth power of
absolute temperature, as per Stefan’s law. According to Stefan’s law (also known as the Stefan–
Boltzmann law), emitted infrared power P is given by
P ¼ AesT4

where A, e, s and T are surface area (m2), emissivity of the material, Stefan’s constant and absolute
temperature (K), respectively. The peak emitted wavelength from the hot body is also inversely
proportional to the absolute temperature as per Wien’s displacement law, that is,
lmax / 1=T
Figure 13.11 shows the basic block schematic of an infrared thermometer.
Some of the common application scenarios where non-contact infrared temperature measurement can
be particularly useful include moving objects such as rollers and conveyor belts, chemically or
electrically hazardous situations such as high voltages and applications where the temperatures are
too high to be measured by thermocouples and other contact sensors. Infrared thermometry is also useful
where the object is contained in vacuum or controlled atmosphere or where the object is surrounded by
an electromagnetic ﬁeld, as is the case in induction heating.
Important parameters to be considered when choosing an infrared thermometer for a given application
include: ﬁeld-of-view, target emissivity, spectral response, temperature range, response time and
mounting considerations. Infrared thermometers are available today in a variety of shapes, form factors
and mounting conﬁgurations, including those designed for ﬂexible and handheld usage and those
designed for ﬁxed-mount applications. Figure 13.12 depicts a handheld high-temperature infrared
thermometer, type OS 523E/524E series from Omega Engineering. This infrared thermometer is capable

of measuring temperature up to 4500 F, has a distance measuring feature and is also equipped with laser
sight.
13.3
Laser Velocimetry
Laser velocimetry is extensively used for the measurement of one or more velocity components over one
or more dimensions. Although the most widely exploited application of laser velocimetry continues to be
in the measurement of transparent and semi-transparent ﬂuid ﬂow, it has also been used for the
measurement of linear or vibratory motion of opaque reﬂecting surfaces. Different techniques of laser
velocimetry include: laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) and its variant phase Doppler velocimetry (PDV),
particle image velocimetry (PIV), particle transit velocimetry (PTV) and global Doppler velocimetry
(GDV) and its variant global phase Doppler (GPD). While LDV is an interferometric technique, PIVand
PTVare imaging techniques. As for PIV, GDVis a planar technique but directly utilizes the Doppler shift
of light scattered from moving particles. Laser velocimetry techniques can be further extended in phase
Doppler and global phase Doppler techniques to be used for the measurement of particle size in addition
to ﬂuid ﬂow velocity, assuming spherical and homogeneous particles. One of the major advantages of
laser velocimetry techniques is their non-intrusiveness. These techniques allow measurement of ﬂuid
ﬂow properties without interfering ﬂuid ﬂow.
All laser velocimetry techniques mentioned above are tracer-based methods depending upon elastic
light scattering from tracer particles. Tracer particles are added to the ﬂuid ﬂow under study and the
velocity of ﬂuid ﬂow is measured in terms of the velocity of these particles, making the assumption that
the particle velocity is representative of the ﬂuid ﬂow velocity. For this assumption to hold, the size and
density of tracer particles have to be carefully chosen for a given ﬂuid ﬂow. Factors such as tracer particle
generation, insertion into the ﬂow and their light scattering properties signiﬁcantly affect the accuracy of
measurement. The randomness of the ﬂow ﬁeld sample inherent in tracer-based techniques either in
space (using planar techniques such as PIV and GDV) or in time (using point techniques such as LDV)
makes signal processing for estimation of ﬂuid ﬂow properties an extremely complex task. Two of the
above-mentioned techniques – LDVand PIV, interferometric and imaging techniques, respectively – are
brieﬂy described in the following sections.
13.3.1
Laser Doppler Velocimetry
Laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) is an interferometric method that can be used to remotely and non-
intrusively measure a single velocity component at a highly localized point in space. More than
one optical system can be combined to simultaneously measure up to three velocity components of a
ﬂuid ﬂow.
13.3.1.1
Operational Principle
Two possible approaches have been used to build an LDV set-up. In one of the approaches used in earlier
devices, the laser beam is split into two collimated beams. One of the beams (probe or measurement
beam) is focused into the ﬂuid ﬂow seeded with tracer particles, while the second beam (reference beam)
passes outside the ﬂuid ﬂow. The light of the measurement beam passing through the ﬂuid and scattered
by the tracer particles experiences a Doppler shift. A part of this Doppler-shifted scattered light is made
to fall on the photodetector. The reference beam is also made to fall on the photodetector. The optical
heterodyne detection taking place on the detector produces an electrical signal proportional to the
Doppler shift. The Doppler shift allows computation of the particle velocity component and hence the
ﬂuid ﬂow velocity component in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the two light beams.
The two beams are derived from a single monochromatic and coherent laser beam to ensure coherence
between the two beams. The transmitting optics focuses the two laser beams in order to intersect inside
the ﬂuid ﬂow at their waists. The two beams interfere and generate a set of straight fringes. As the ﬂuid
entrained with appropriate tracer particles ﬂows past the fringes, the particles scatter light elastically. The
scatter could be forward scatter, backscatter or even side scatter. (The LDV can be set up to receive any of
478
Lasers and Optoelectronics

the three scattered lights.) The scattered light as collected by the receiving optics is focused onto a
photodetector, which is usually a photomultiplier tube (PMT) or an avalanche photodiode (APD). The
intensity of the scattered light ﬂuctuates or modulates at a frequency equal to the Doppler shift between
the incident and the scattered light. The Doppler shift can then be used to compute the velocity
component in the direction of the plane of the two laser beams. Figure 13.13 shows the LDV set-up that
makes use of forward scatter. The Doppler frequency fD in this case is given by Equation 13.1:
f D ¼ 2Vxsin u
ð
Þ
l
(13.1)
where Vx is ﬂuid ﬂow velocity, u is the angle between the direction of ﬂuid ﬂow and the scattered signal
and l is wavelength.
Figure 13.14 depicts the LDV set-up that makes use of backscatter. Lasers with output wavelength in
the visible spectrum in the range of 390–750 nm are generally used for LDV applications, allowing the
Figure 13.13

beam path to be observed. Compared to infrared wavelengths, visible wavelengths produce a stronger
Doppler signal.
13.3.1.2
Advantages
Laser Doppler velocimetry offers the following advantages:
1. It can be effectively used for different types of ﬂuid ﬂows including gas and liquid ﬂows.
2. It is a non-intrusive method, that is, no physical probe is required with the result that there is no
obstruction to the ﬂow.
3. It offers excellent spatial resolution with the measuring volume being of the order of a very small
fraction of a cubic millimetre.
4. The output electrical signal is linearly related to the Doppler frequency which in turn is linearly
related to ﬂow velocity.
5. It offers a fast response to ﬂuctuating velocities. For a Doppler frequency of 1 MHz, the typical
frequency response goes up to 50 kHz.
13.3.1.3
Applications
Laser Doppler velocimetry has been widely used in a variety of applications in ﬂow research, medical
diagnostics and process and quality control in industrial production processes. Common applications
related to ﬂow research include: the testing of aerodynamics of aircraft, missiles, automobiles, buildings
and other structures by wind tunnel velocity experiments; hydrodynamics research, ship hull design and
pipe and channel ﬂows through velocity measurements in water ﬂows; fuel injection and spray research
by measuring velocities through nozzles and inside the engines; and environmental research including
combustion research, tidal modelling, wave dynamics, river hydrology and so on.
There are also many applications in the ﬁeld of medicine; for example, laser Doppler ﬂowmetry is
used to partially quantify blood ﬂow in human tissues such as skin, which is further used to monitor the
effect of exercise, environmental or physical manipulations and drug treatment of targeted micro-sized
vascular areas. The laser light in this case is scattered with a Doppler shift from red blood cells. It is also
used in clinical otology, which refers to the study and medical care of the ear. LDV is used for the
measurement of displacement of the tympanic membrane (a thin cone-shaped membrane that separates
the external ear from the middle ear), malleus (hammer-shaped small bone of the middle ear which
connects with the incus or anvil) or prosthesis head in response to sound inputs of 80–100 dB sound
pressure level.
Common applications of LDVin industry relate to process control, for example measuring the velocity
and length of moving surfaces is the basis of all industrial process and quality control applications. Laser
surface velocimetry is also used to measure the speed and length of moving surfaces on coils, strips,
tubes, paper, ﬁlm, foil or any other moving material. Different tasks that can be performed on moving
surfaces using laser surface velocimetry include cut-to-length control, path length and spool length
measurement, speed measurement and speed control, encoder calibration and inkjet marker control.
13.3.2
Particle Image Velocimetry
Particle image velocimetry is a planar and an imaging technique. While LDV depends upon the
coherence property of the laser for its operation, PIV does not require coherence of the laser. PIV
measures whole velocity ﬁelds by taking two images captured by a charged-couple device (CCD) camera
within a short time differential and calculating the distance travelled by individual particles within this
time. The velocity of tracer particles and hence the ﬂow velocity is then computed from the known time
difference and the measured displacement values. The displacement is commonly measured by dividing
the image plane into small interrogation spots and then cross-correlating the images from the two time
exposures. The spatial displacement producing the maximum cross-correlation statistically approx-
imates the average displacement of the particles in the interrogation cell. The velocity component
480
Lasers and Optoelectronics

associated with each interrogation is given by the ratio of displacement to the time between the two
pulses.
A Q-switched frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser operating at 532 nm with pulse energy of the order of
a few hundreds of millijoules and pulse width in the range 5–10 ns is generally used. A short pulse width
of less than 10 ns is used to ensure that the tracer particle motion is frozen during each exposure.
Although coherence is not a requirement in PIV, a laser is used as only laser light can be focused into a
thin enough sheet to image particles only in a given plane. For a typical CCD camera of resolution
1000  1000 pixels, up to 4000 interrogation cells with an equal number of velocity vectors per image
pair can be obtained. Framing rates of most PIV cameras are of the order 10–20 Hz, compatible with
pulse repetition rates of Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers.
A variant of PIV is particle tracking velocimetry (PTV). The two techniques are exactly the same in
terms of operational principle and measurement hardware, but the latter is used for sparsely seeded ﬂows
or for dispersed two-phase ﬂows. In PTV, individual particle movements are examined.
Although pulsed lasers are commonly used for both PIV and PTV techniques, CW lasers can also be
used in principle. In this case, the functions of pulse duration and pulse interval can be obtained by
control of the camera shutter. CW lasers cannot compare with pulsed lasers in terms of peak power level;
as a result of this, their use is limited to low-speed water ﬂows where large tracer particles with good
scattering properties can be used.
Figure 13.15 shows the optical set-up of particle image velocimetry. A dual-cavity laser is used
in order to illuminate a plane within the ﬂow twice in quick succession with a small time differential.
Figure 13.15
Particle image velocimetry set-up.

This time differential is matched to the local ﬂow velocity and hence to the expected displacement of
tracer particles between successive pulses. One or two CCD cameras record the scattered light. One
camera is sufﬁcient to record the two in-plane velocity components. A third camera is required only
when the third out-of-plane velocity component is also to be measured.
13.4
Laser Vibrometry
Laser vibrometry is a non-contact technique used for measurement of surface vibrations. It is
operationally similar to laser velocimetry, extracting information on the vibration amplitude and
frequency from the Doppler shift undergone by the laser beam frequency due to vibratory motion of
the surface of interest. Compared to electromechanical devices such as an accelerometer, used for
measurement of vibratory motion, laser Doppler vibrometry offers all the advantages of being a non-
contact method. For example, it does not mass load the target surface. It can be used on surfaces that are
hard to access and also those surfaces that are either too small or too hot for attachment of a physical
transducer.
13.4.1
Operational Principle
Laser Doppler vibrometry is also an interferometric technique that utilizes the coherence property of the
laser beam. A two-beam laser interferometer extracts the vibration data from the interference pattern
resulting from a probe beam reﬂected from the vibrating surface and a reference beam.
When two coherent light beams interfere, the resulting intensity is not simply the sum of the single
intensities; is modulated by a third term resulting from the interference phenomenon. This interference
term is a function of the path length difference between the two beams. The resultant intensity I is given
by Equation 13.2:
I ¼ I1 þ I2 þ 2
ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ
I1  I2  cos
2p L1  L2
ð
Þ
l


s
(13.2)
where I1 and I2 are the intensities of the two interfering laser beams; L1 and L2 are the corresponding path
lengths traversed by them before they recombine; and l is the operational wavelength.
As is evident from Equation 13.2, the interference term depends upon the path length difference
between the two laser beams. If this path length difference is an integer multiple of the laser wavelength,
the overall intensity is four times the single intensity. The overall intensity is zero if the two beams had a
path length difference of half of one wavelength. This gives rise to a fringe pattern.
Figure 13.16 shows the laser Doppler vibrometry set-up. The laser beam is split by a beam splitter
(BS1) into a reference beam and a probe beam. The reference beam after reﬂection from mirror M1
reaches another beam splitter (BS2). The probe beam is frequency shifted by about 40 MHz with an
acousto-optic modulator such as a Bragg cell before it reaches another beam splitter (BS3). After passing
through BS3, the measurement beam is focused onto the object under investigation and reﬂected by it.
This reﬂected beam is now deﬂected upwards by BS3 before it recombines with the reference beam in
BS2 as shown in the ﬁgure. The combined beam is then directed onto the photodetector.
As the path length of the reference beam is constant over time (except for negligibly small
thermally induced variations), a vibratory motion of the target surface causes a variation in path
length L1 with respect to time. This produces an interference pattern of dark and bright fringes. One
complete dark-bright cycle on the detector corresponds to an object displacement of exactly half of
the wavelength of the light used. In the case of the helium-neon laser, which is the most widely used
laser type for laser vibrometry applications, this corresponds to a displacement of 316.4 nm. The rate
of change of optical path length manifests itself as the Doppler frequency shift of the probe beam.
This means that the modulation frequency of the interferometer pattern determined is directly
proportional to the velocity of the object. Measurement of both velocity as well as displacement is
possible with the interferometer.
482
Lasers and Optoelectronics

The introduction of the Bragg cell in the path of the probe beam to shift the laser beam frequency of the
probe beam by a known magnitude is intended to enable determination of direction of motion. In the
absence of this frequency shift introduced by the Bragg cell, the interferometer will generate the same
frequency shift or interference pattern irrespective of whether the object was moving towards or away
from the interferometer. In the case of frequency-shifted operation, there is a modulation frequency of
the fringe pattern of 40 MHz when the object is stationary. During object movement, the frequency is
either greater or less than 40 MHz, depending upon direction of motion. This allows measurement of
both amplitude and direction of motion.
Figure 13.17 depicts a laser Doppler vibrometer, Model no LVS-01 from Sunny Instruments
Singapore Pte Ltd. The instrument uses a class 2 He-Ne laser operating at 632.8 nm wavelength and
is designed for precise measurement of vibration, speed and displacement. Speed, displacement and
acceleration measurements can be made at a resolution of 1 mm s1, 0.3 nm (at 500 Hz) and 0.0003 g (at
500 Hz), respectively.
Applications include motor dynamics and rotation accuracy measurement; machine tool dynamics
and accuracy testing; diagnostics in life sciences, medicine and zoology; dynamic testing of computer

peripherals such as hard disk drives, CD and tape machines; bridge and structure vibration testing;
MEMS system dynamic testing; measurement of roughness and thickness; the detection of mechanical
vibration; and fault diagnosis.
13.4.2
Types of Laser Doppler Vibrometers
Laser Doppler vibrometers are made in various conﬁgurations. Some common variants include single-
point vibrometers, scanning vibrometers, 3D vibrometers, rotational vibrometers, differential vibrom-
eters, multibeam vibrometers, self-mixing vibrometers and continuous-scan laser vibrometers.
A single-point vibrometer is the most common type of vibrometer and is used to measure displace-
ment or velocity at a single chosen point on the vibrating object at a time. This is the type described in the
previous section. A scanning vibrometer allows the single laser beam to be moved across the surface of
interest with the help of x–y scanning mirrors.
A 3D vibrometer is designed to measure all three components of the velocity. It may be mentioned
here that a standard laser vibrometer measures the velocity of the target along the direction of the laser
beam. To measure all three velocity components at a point on the target object, the 3D vibrometer uses
three independent laser beams which strike the target from three different directions. This allows
determination of the two in-plane components and one out-of-plane component of velocity.
Rotational vibrometers are used to measure rotational or angular velocity. Differential vibrometers
measure the out-of-plane velocity difference between two different locations on the target. Multibeam
vibrometers are capable of simultaneously measuring the target velocity at several locations. Self-mixing
vibrometers are very rugged and compact instruments. They are generally conﬁgured around a laser
diode with a built-in photodetector. A continuous-scan vibrometer is a modiﬁed form of a laser Doppler
vibrometer, in which the laser beam is continuously swept across the surface of the test specimen to
capture the motion of a surface at different points.
13.4.3
Applications
Laser Doppler vibrometers are used in a wide variety of applications in science, industry, aerospace,
defence and medicine. Laser vibrometry is extensively used in aerospace industry for applications such
as the non-destructive inspection of aircraft components and the automotive industry for structural
dynamics, quantiﬁcation of noise and vibration and measurement of speed accuracy.
Common biological applications of laser vibrometry include ear drum diagnostics and insect
communication. Laser vibrometry is used in the music industry for speaker design and for diagnosing
the performance of musical instruments, and by the computer industry for dynamic testing of computer
peripherals such as hard disk drives.
An emerging application of laser vibrometry is in the detection of buried land mines. The operational
concept is based on exciting the ground by using an audio source, inducing ground vibration. The
difference in the vibration characteristics of the ground above and away from the buried land mine
enables its detection. The ground surface above the location of a buried mine shows enhanced vibration
at the resonance frequency of the land mine and soil combination. A laser vibrometer measures the
vibration amplitude and extracts information on land mine location. The concept has been successfully
demonstrated using single-beam scanning type and array laser vibrometers. Figure 13.18 illustrates the
concept.
13.5
Electronic Speckle Pattern Interferometry
Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) is an optical interferometric technique enabling
measurements of surface displacements or deformations on material surfaces caused by some kind
of loading, which could be mechanical, thermal, vibrational or pressure. It is a non-contact, full-ﬁeld
measurement technique that allows computation of the 3D distribution of displacement and strain/stress
of the object under test in response to loading, with a sensitivity equal to half of the operating
wavelength. ESPI has been successfully used for the study of material properties, fatigue testing, fracture
484
Lasers and Optoelectronics

mechanics, vibrational mode analysis and non-destructive testing of a variety of components in the
automotive, aerospace and electronics industries. It uses laser light together with video detection,
recording and processing to visualize static and dynamic displacements of object surfaces. Visualization
is in the form of fringes on an image, where each fringe represents a displacement of half of the
operational wavelength (which is of the order a fraction of a micron).
13.5.1
Operational Principle
The object surface under test is illuminated by an expanded coherent laser beam. Considering that the
object surface is rough by optical standards, which is one of the requirements of speckle pattern
interferometry, the optical image formed in the image plane of the CCD camera is a subjective speckle
pattern. The detailed structure of the speckle pattern depends on the viewing system parameters such as
the lens aperture (size of speckle) and position of the imaging system.
On the other hand, when laser light scattered off a rough surface falls on another surface, it forms an
objective speckle pattern. Each point in the image can be considered to be illuminated by a ﬁnite area in
the object surface. The amplitude, phase and intensity of the speckle pattern are all random and represent
the microstructure of the corresponding area on the object surface.
In the next step, a reference light beam derived from the same laser source is superimposed on the
CCD camera image. The image speckle pattern and the reference light ﬁeld interfere and the resulting
light ﬁeld, which has random amplitude, phase and intensity, is therefore also a speckle pattern. This
pattern is recorded by the CCD camera. When the object surface is displaced or deformed in response to
some kind of loading, the distance between the object and image changes, thereby changing the phase of
the image speckle pattern. This causes a change in the intensity of the combined light ﬁeld. However, the
intensity of the overall image emains unchanged if the phase change of the image light ﬁeld is a multiple
of 2p.
The new combined image of the deformed surface is also recorded. This new image is subtracted point
by point from the ﬁrst image. The resulting image is a fringe pattern, which reveals the displacement of
Figure 13.18
Detection of buried land mines.

the surface during loading as contour lines of deformation. Figure 13.19 illustrates an electron speckle
pattern interferometry set-up.
The qualitative fringe patterns are noisy due to the presence of speckles and have low contrast. This is
overcome by the process of phase shifting, which takes a series of speckle images for each surface state
and calculates a quantitative phase map. The information in the phase map can be directly transformed
into a displacement value.
13.5.2
Measurement Conﬁgurations
Electron speckle pattern interferometry can be employed in different conﬁgurations to suit the
requirement of the intended measurement. These include conﬁgurations for out-of-plane displace-
ment measurement, in-plane displacement measurement, in-plane displacement gradient measure-
ment, 3D measurement and vibration analysis. Each of these is brieﬂy described in the following
sections.
13.5.2.1
Out-of-plane Displacement Measurement
Figure 13.20 shows the schematic diagram of the ESPI set-up used for measurement of the out-of-plane
component of displacement. The concept here is the same as for the basic operational principle of ESPI.
As shown in the diagram, the laser beam is split into two beams by a beam splitter. One of the beams
(object beam) illuminates the measurement surface under test. The light is scattered back towards the
CCD camera by the object surface. The second beam (reference beam) is combined with the object beam
through the beam splitter and the combined beam is directed towards the camera sensor. The interference
pattern (also called speckle pattern) formed is recorded by the CCD camera. After the object has become
deformed, the new interference pattern is also recorded; the difference between the two images yields a
measure of the deformation. Strictly speaking, the fringe pattern resulting from the difference between
two speckle patterns only represents the purely out-of-plane displacement if the surface is illuminated

normally. However, since the dependence on in-plane movement is relatively small, the measurement
error is negligible for small angular deviations of object illumination away from normal.
13.5.2.2
In-plane Displacement Measurement
For measurement of the in-plane component of displacement, the object surface is symmetrically
irradiated from opposite sides of the object by two laser beams derived from a common laser output. It
may be mentioned here that there can be two possible components of in-plane displacement measure-
ment. In a given in-plane displacement measurement set-up, in-plane deformations formed by the two
laser irradiation beams and the observation direction are measured. If the other orthogonal component of
in-plane displacement is to be measured, a second pair of laser beams is required.
When the object surface which is displaced or deformed has a component in the direction normal to the
viewing direction, the phase of one of the beams increases while that of the other decreases. As a result,
the relative phase difference between the two beams changes. If the phase difference is a multiple of 2p
radians, the speckle pattern remains unchanged. When the subtraction technique as described in the case
of out-of-plane displacement measurement is used, fringes are obtained which represent in-plane
displacement contours. Figure 13.21 shows the schematic diagram of in-plane displacement
measurement.
13.5.2.3
In-plane Displacement Gradient Measurement
For measurement of the in-plane component of displacement gradient, the object is irradiated by the two
laser beams derived from the same laser source as for in-plane displacement measurement. In the case of
displacement gradient measurement however, the two laser beams are incident on the object surface from
the same side but at different angles as shown in the schematic arrangement of Figure 13.22. When the
object is displaced or deformed in its own plane, it can be shown that the relative phase difference
between the two laser beams changes in proportion to the gradient of the in-plane displacement. Again,
of the difference between the two is used to produce the fringe pattern representative of displacement
gradient.

Schematic diagram of out-of-plane displacement measurement.
Lasers in Science and Technology

13.5.2.4
Three-dimensional (3D) Measurement
A 3D measurement of displacement allows measurement of the two in-plane and one out-of-plane
components of displacement. It therefore requires a combination of the two techniques described in
Sections 13.5.2.1 and 13.5.2.2 for in-plane and out-of-plane components of displacement. In order to
record the two in-plane components of displacement, two orthogonal pairs of laser irradiation are
required. In order to be able to measure the out-of-plane component of displacement, one of the
radiations used for the in-plane component is coupled with an internal reference beam. The directions of
the two laser radiations are usually switched automatically and the corresponding speckle patterns are
recorded. These speckle patterns are then processed to extract the complete 3D information displacement
or deformation.
A typical 3D ESPI camera comprises two internal laser sources and a CCD camera. Figure 13.23
depicts a 3D ESPI camera, Model: Q-300 from Dantec Dynamics, Denmark. The two horizontal
and the two vertical ports provide laser illumination for the two in-plane measurements. Another
port, as seen in front in the photograph, and a reference beam are used for out-of-plane
measurement.

13.5.2.5
Vibration Measurement
Vibration mode analysis can be carried out using ESPI by either continuous wave laser radiation and
shutter combination or a pulsed laser. An acousto-optic cell is generally used as a shutter for applied
frequencies up to 40 kHz. Pulsed lasers are used for vibration frequencies greater than 40 kHz and for
random vibrations. The laser is synchronized with the vibration source in order to provide
illumination of the object surface under test at the maximum and minimum of the vibration modes
of the material, allowing the ESPI system to quantitatively measure the displacements produced by
the applied vibration.
13.6
Satellite Laser Ranging
Satellite laser ranging (SLR) measures the range of an Earth-orbiting satellite with the objective of
determining the orbital parameters of satellites. By comparing these measured parameters to their
predicted values, the temporal variation of the Earth’s centre of mass can be accurately measured.
A global network of ground stations measure the instantaneous time-of-ﬂight of ultra-short laser
pulses from the laser receiver to the satellite, equipped with special reﬂectors, back to the laser
receiver. Instantaneous range information is calculated with a precision of a few millimetres, which
can be used to generate orbital parameter data for the satellite. Figure 13.24 illustrates the
technique.
The concept of satellite laser ranging is more than ﬁve decades old. It was initially experimented with
in 1962 while looking for a solution to the inadequate ranging accuracy achievable at that time by means
of optical and radar tracking of satellites; optical and radar tracking could provide tracking station
coordinates to an accuracy of the order 100 m. Some of the geophysical processes such as Earth tides and
plate tectonic motions affect tracking station coordinates to a level of a few centimetres over timescales
ranging from less than one day to several years, however. Measurement accuracy of a few centimetres
carried out for many years would therefore be required in order to obtain any experimental data capable
of challenging/conﬁrming any geodetic research.
Over the years, the concept of laser ranging to retro reﬂectors mounted on Earth-orbiting
satellites has enhanced ranging accuracy to a level of a few millimetres, thereby signiﬁcantly
improving geodetic information. The improvement in accuracy has been assisted by the availa-
bility of ultra-fast pulsed lasers such as mode-locked Nd:YAG lasers and high-speed high-
quantum-efﬁciency detectors such as microchannel plate (MCP) detectors and single-photon
avalanche diodes (SAPD).

Figure 13.25 shows the block schematic arrangement of SLR station equipment. Ultra-short pulses from
the laser are transmitted towards the orbiting satellite through the transmitting telescope, driven by a
control system to point the laser beam towards the predicted position of the satellite. The laser beam is
reﬂected from retro-reﬂectors mounted on the satellite to reach the detector system through the receiving
telescope. In most cases, as shown in Figure 13.25, a common telescope is used for both transmit and
receive purposes. The time instants of laser transmit and receive pulses as recorded by photodetectors are
used to start and stop a time interval counter, thereby allowing computation of the round-trip time of the
laser pulse. Multiplying half of the round-trip time by the speed of light gives the range to the satellite at
the time instant of the laser transmit pulse. The measurement is time-stamped with an accurate epoch.
In order to be able to measure range with an accuracy of a few millimetres, two important factors need
to be considered. These are the precision with which the epoch is recorded and the uncertainty due to
transmit laser pulse width. Assuming the orbital velocity to be 5 km s1, which is typical of a geodetic
satellite at a relatively lower height, the epoch would need to be recorded to an accuracy of better than
1 ms. This is achieved by most SLR stations by recording epochs with respect to the timescale broadcast
by the global positioning system (GPS), which is precisely related to and closely aligned with the
universal time clock (UTC).
The round-trip measurement time also needs to be measured with the required precision to obtain the
desired level of ranging accuracy of a few millimetres. Quantitatively, 3 mm range inaccuracy
corresponds to a round-trip time uncertainty of 20 ps, that is, a laser pulse width of 20 ps is needed
for a measurement uncertainty of 3 mm in range. Other sources of error are from the internal optical and
electronic path delays in the range measuring system. These can be accounted for by range calibration

measurements carried out to a nearby reﬂective target board whose accurate distance from the invariant
point of the range telescope has been independently surveyed.
13.6.2
Lasers for SLR
Choice of laser plays an important role in the measurement accuracy of round-trip time-of-ﬂight and
thereby the accuracy of measurement of range. Earlier experiments with satellite laser ranging during the
1960s used Q-switched laser pulses of pulse width of the order nanoseconds, pulse energy of few joules
and a pulse repetition rate of one pulse every 3–5 seconds from a ruby laser emitting at 694.3 nm. The
lower limit of the pulse width from the ruby laser at that time was limited to a few tens of nanoseconds by
practical limitations on the rotation rate of the mirror Q-switch. With these lasers, the best achievable
accuracy was of the order 0.5–1.0 m.
With the advent of non-mechanical electro-optic and acousto-optic Q-switches and also passive
Q-switching using saturable absorbers, the ability to generate sub-nanosecond pulses improved accuracy
of the range measurement to that of 10 cm or so.
A further quantum jump in measurement accuracy was achieved with pulse widths of the order
of tens of picoseconds generated by mode-locked lasers. A mode-locked Nd:YAG laser with a
Q-switched envelope is the preferred laser. In most cases, the laser pulse with highest peak power in
the train of pulses in the Q-switched envelope is used. Peak power is generally of the order of
gigawatts. Frequency-doubled output at 532 nm is generally used as opposed to infrared output at
1064 nm due to the relatively much higher speed and higher quantum efﬁciency of detectors in the
visible spectrum.
13.6.3
SLR Telescopes and Stations
The telescope is another important part of the SLR station. The telescopes used for SLR measurements
fall into two main categories: those using the same optical path for transmit and receive purposes and
those using separate but co-mounted telescopes for transmit and receive operations. In some cases, two
individually mounted and controlled telescopes have also been used.
Beam transport optics is used to transmit the laser beam from the laser output to the telescope input.
The beam transport optics must ensure that laser beam lies along the optical axis of the telescope,
irrespective of where the telescope is pointing in the sky.
Required tracking speeds depend upon the satellite altitude in addition to other factors. The time for
which a satellite is visible to a given SLR station for carrying out measurements may vary from a few
hours in the case of high-altitude satellites (e.g. ETALON and GLONASS) to few minutes for low-
altitude satellites (e.g. STARLETTE and STELLA). Tracking speeds of up to 2 s1 may be required in
order to track satellites at relatively lower heights while maintaining an absolute pointing accuracy of a
few arc seconds.
Because of the altitude-azimuth mount used in modern telescopes, the azimuth velocity required to
track satellites that pass near zenith can be very large. Telescopes are generally desired to slew at speeds
of typically 20 s1 with higher acceleration capability. An alt-azimuth mount is a simple two-axis
mount for supporting and rotating the telescope about two mutually perpendicular axes. Rotation about
the vertical axis varies the azimuth of the pointing direction of the telescope, while rotation about the
horizontal axis varies the altitude or angle of elevation of the pointing direction.
Currently, there are more than 30 active SLR stations connected in a worldwide network with most of
them routinely achieving ranging accuracy of 1 cm RMS. The measurements carried out by these centres
are regularly passed on to data centres for subsequent analysis by the scientiﬁc community. Some of the
better-known satellite laser ranging stations include: Burnie TAFE in Australia; Concepcion TIGO in
Chile; Herstmonceux in the UK; LURE in Hawaii; McDonald in the USA; MOBLAS-4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 in
the USA, Australia, South Africa, USA and Tahiti, respectively; Mount Stromlo and Orroral in Australia;
POTSDAM-2 and 3 and Wettzell in Germany; and Wuhan in China. Figure 13.26 is a photograph of the
MOBLAS-7 SLR station, one of the most advanced SLR stations, located at the Goddard Geophysical
and Astronomical Observatory (GGAO).

13.6.4
SLR Applications
There are three categories of satellites that have been routinely tracked by these tracking stations for a
range of scientiﬁc applications: geodetic, applications and navigational satellites.
Geodetic satellites are relatively small and inert satellites, spherical in shape with a high-density core
and a surface uniformly covered with corner cube retro-reﬂectors (Figure 13.27). These retro-reﬂectors
are optimized to reﬂect the wavelength of interest, which is 532 nm in most SLR systems. Common
satellites in this category include STARLETTE (1975) with a diameter of 24 cm and an orbit height of
962 km; STELLA (1993) with diameter of 24 cm and orbit height of 810 km; AJISAI (1986) with a
diameter of 215 cm and orbit height of 1500 km; LAGEOS-1 (1976) and LAGEOS-2 (1992) both having
a diameter of 60 cm and an orbit height of 600 km; and ETALON-1 and 2 (1989) with a 129 cm diameter
and orbit height of 19 000 km.

Observations from relatively low-altitude geodetic satellites are particularly suited to determining
high-frequency terms in the expansion of the Earth’s gravity ﬁeld, used to study ocean tides and
modelling variations in atmospheric density. Measurements from high-altitude geodetic satellites are
extensively used for the determination of low-frequency terms in the models which represent Earth’s
gravity ﬁeld and in the global terrestrial reference frame to study crustal motions.
In the category of applications satellites are the Earth observation and remote sensing satellites. SLR is
currently the most accurate technique available for determining the geocentric position of an Earth
satellite. By virtue of being the only space geodetic technique deﬁning the Earth’s centre of mass, SLR
contributes to the deﬁnition of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF). SLR measurements
help to model the temporal and spatial variation of the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld, contribute to the
determination of ocean and Earth tides and are used to monitor tectonic plates and crustal deformation.
SLR measurements are also used for monitoring Earth rotation and polar motion to relate it to the
International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF). Finally, SLR provides a unique capability for
veriﬁcation of the theory of general relativity.
In the case of navigational satellites, SLR measurements are used to provide an independent check on
the accuracy of orbital information derived from radiometric tracking measurements.
13.7
Lasers in Astronomy
Lasers are used in astronomy as part of adaptive optics systems to improve the image quality in
astronomical telescopes. One of the major factors that limit the image quality in ground-based
astronomical telescopes is the image distortion resulting from the passage of light through Earth’s
atmosphere. Space-based telescopes are free from this problem. However, space-based telescopes cannot
be as large as terrestrial telescopes and are very expensive to build, launch, operate and maintain.
13.7.1
Adaptive Optics
One effective method of overcoming the problem of image distortion from terrestrial telescopes is by
using adaptive optics. An adaptive optical system involves measurement of wavefront distortion. A
reference laser source is made to travel through the same atmospheric path, and is corrected or nulliﬁed
by using an adaptive optical element such as a deformable mirror as one of the optical elements of the
telescope. A deformable mirror is an adaptive optical element with a ﬂexible surface proﬁle that can be
given any desired shape. This is usually done by driving the surface by piezo actuators. Once the image
of the reference light source has undergone atmospheric distortion, corrected is obtained by controlling
the shape of the ﬂexible optical element. The object of interest is then viewed with the corrected element.
Figure 13.28 shows the schematic diagram of how laser-guide-star-assisted adaptive optics corrects
wavefront distortions caused by atmospheric turbulence to improve the image quality. The adaptive
optics system, comprising wavefront sensor, control system and deformable mirror, measures
the distortion with light from the guide star and issues the appropriate control signals to the deformable
mirror. Distortions in the light from the object of interest are eliminated after reﬂection from
the deformable mirror. As an illustration, Figure 13.29 shows two images of the trapezium region in
the Orion Nebula. The image of Figure 13.29a was acquired in 1999 without adaptive optics in place and
Figure 13.29b was taken in 2006 using adaptive optics.
13.7.2
Laser Guide Star
The reference light source is one of the most critical elements of the adaptive optical system, as there
aren’t many high-brightness natural sources in the sky that can fulﬁl the brightness-level requirements.
The reference source also needs to be close to the object of interest to be able to measure the phase
distortions in the incoming wavefront. The solution lies in the creation of an artiﬁcial bright light source
close to the object of interest. This is achieved by pointing a laser beam towards the sky. It is the
backscattering of the laser beam in the upper atmosphere above the turbulent layers that acts as a
reference source. This artiﬁcial bright light source is referred to as the laser guide star.
494
Lasers and Optoelectronics

The laser guide star can be positioned anywhere in the sky, allowing a much larger fraction of the sky
to be accessible for the adaptive optical system. The position of the artiﬁcial guide star may drift due to
its passage through the atmosphere. This can however be corrected by monitoring the position of a
nearby natural star and using a tip-tilt mirror. This star does not have to be as bright as the guide star.

optics (Courtesy of the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan).

13.7.3
Laser Guide Star Mechanisms
There are two broad mechanisms by which the artiﬁcial light source is created using lasers. The ﬁrst
mechanism involves the process of Rayleigh scattering from air molecules such as nitrogen. The second
mechanism makes use of sodium ﬂuorescence caused by the sodium layer in the mesosphere. For
maximum efﬁcacy of the two mechanisms of producing laser guide stars, each of the two mechanisms
must possess some speciﬁc properties.
13.7.3.1
Rayleigh Guide Star
The Rayleigh guide star is based on Rayleigh scattering in the lower atmosphere. In contrast to a sodium
beacon that requires a narrow-line-width laser to produce resonant absorption, there is no such critical
requirement for a Rayleigh guide star. The choice of laser wavelength is also not critical, except that it
should be short to cause efﬁcient Rayleigh scattering. Although the commonly used laser is the
frequency-doubled solid-state laser, a copper vapour laser or an excimer laser can also be used. Pulsed
lasers with nanosecond-wide laser pulses are preferred over continuous wave lasers. The pulsed format
simpliﬁes the non-linear frequency conversion in the laser source, and enables time-gated detection.
Such laser sources are generally less complex and more powerful than those used with sodium beacon
guide stars.
The disadvantage of the Rayleigh guide star is that the lower altitude of backscattered light
compromises the quality of the wavefront correction. The William Herschel telescope located in La
Palma, Canary Islands, Spain uses a Rayleigh guide star. The telescope is part of the Isaac Newton Group
of telescopes, and is funded by research councils from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Spain.
Figure 13.31 is a photograph of the 4.2 m Herschel telescope.
13.7.3.2
Sodium Beacon Guide Star
A sodium beacon guide star makes use of the sodium layer in the mesosphere at an altitude of 90 km
above the surface of Earth. Sodium atoms are naturally present in the sodium layer. A sodium guide star
is created by using a laser tuned to 589.2 nm, which is the resonant absorption wavelength of sodium
atoms. This causes sodium atoms to absorb laser light and subsequently to emit ﬂuorescence at the same
wavelength.
The availability of a suitable laser at the desired wavelength and line width is a difﬁcult proposition.
Available laser options for sodium beacons include: (1) Raman laser based on a bulk crystal, pumped
with a frequency-doubled Q-switched neodymium-based solid-state laser; (2) a frequency-doubled
Raman ﬁbre laser emitting at 1178 nm and pumped by an ytterbium-doped ﬁbre laser; (3) sources based
on sum frequency mixing of two laser sources; or (4) a pulsed dye laser.
The Lick Observatory of the University of California, the Palomar Observatory of Caltech and the
Keck Observatory in Hawaii employ sodium beacon laser guide stars. Figure 13.30 is a photograph of the
Shane telescope at the Lick observatory, equipped with a sodium beacon laser guide star.
Other large observatories that have either added laser-guide-star-aided adaptive optics to the
facility or are considering including one are the Very Large Telescope (VLT) of the European Space
Observatory (ESO) (Figure 13.32), Gemini North and the Multiple Mirror Telescope Observatory
(MMTO).
13.8
Holography
Holography is the technique of forming a three-dimensional image of an object by recording the
interference pattern formed by a split laser beam during the recording process on a photosensitive
material, and illuminating the pattern either with a laser or with ordinary light during reconstruction. The
concept of holography has a wide range of applications other than recording and reconstruction of 3D
images, however. Holographic optical elements (HOE) are used in a myriad of technical devices as
mirrors, lenses, gratings or combinations of these.

In the case of holographic interferometry, a recorded light ﬁeld scattered from the object of interest is
superimposed on the light ﬁeld scattered from the object. If the object has undergone deformation, the
phases of the two light ﬁelds will alter producing an interference pattern that can be interpreted to
measure the deformation. One major application of holographic interferometry is in the measurement of
microscopic displacements on the surface of an object and small changes in refractive index of
transparent objects such as plasma and heat waves.
HOEs are likely to ﬁnd application in a range of future photonic devices for optical computations, free-
space interconnects and analogue and digital memory systems.
13.8.1
Basic Principle
Holography is a technique of recording the light ﬁeld scattered off an object in such a manner that it can
be reconstructed later when the object is no longer present. Holograms are produced by recording on
photosensitive material the interference pattern of the light ﬁeld scattered off the object and a part of the
light beam acting as the reference light ﬁeld. A hologram can be created by illuminating the recording
medium by a part of the light beam falling directly and the other part reaching the recording medium, that
is, the photosensitive material after scattering off the object.
The light source used to produce the interference pattern is a laser for obvious reasons: a laser
is a coherent and monochromatic source of light, unlike sunlight or light from conventional
sources which are incoherent and contain many different wavelengths. Holograms are generally
recorded in darkness or in low-level light of a colour different from that of the laser light used
to make the hologram in order to prevent interference from external light. The exposure time,
which is a critical parameter, is controlled either by using a shutter or by electronically timing
the laser.
Figure 13.33 shows the basic optical arrangement for recording of a hologram. The laser beam is split
into two beams. One of the beams (object beam) is directed towards the object or scene after passing
through some optical elements used to spread the beam, and is not shown in the ﬁgure. Some of this light
energy scattered off the object falls onto the recording medium. The second beam (reference beam) is
also spread through the use of optical elements, and is directed onto the recording medium without
coming in contact with the object or scene. A common recording medium is a ﬁlm of silver halide
photographic emulsion, which has a much higher concentration of light-reactive grains compared to that
of photographic ﬁlm producing higher resolution. A thin layer of silver halide is deposited on a
transparent substrate such as glass or plastic.
The two light ﬁelds interfere and the resulting interference pattern is imprinted on the recording
medium. What is recorded is not the image of the object, but an interference pattern that can be

Optical arrangement for recording of hologram.
498
Lasers and Optoelectronics

considered as an encoded version of the object image. The interference pattern itself is apparently
random, but it contains information on how light scattered from the object interfered with the original
light source.
In order to reconstruct the object image, the encoded version of the object recorded in the hologram in
the form of interference pattern only needs to be decoded. This is achieved by illuminating the hologram
by the light beam identical to that used for recording the hologram. The light beam illuminating the
hologram is diffracted by the hologram’s surface pattern. The light ﬁeld is identical to that originally
produced by the laser beam scattered off the object. This can be seen as a virtual image. Figure 13.34
shows the optical arrangement for reconstruction of hologram.
A hologram records information about the object in the form of light as it scatters off the object in a
range of different directions, rather than from only one direction as in a photograph. As a result, while
each point in a photograph only represents light scattered from a single point in the object or scene,
each point on a holographic recording includes information about light scattered from every point in
the scene. A hologram therefore allows the object or scene to be viewed from different angles as if the
object is still present. The ability to view the object from different angles in a hologram recording
gives the perception of depth.
13.8.2
Types of Hologram
There are different ways of classifying holograms: amplitude modulation and phase modulation
holograms; transmission and reﬂection holograms; and thin and thick holograms. There are many
variations between transmission and reﬂection holograms, collectively known as hybrid holograms.
Each of these types is brieﬂy described in the following sections.
13.8.2.1
Amplitude- and Phase-modulated Holograms
In the case of an amplitude-modulated hologram, the magnitude of light diffracted from the hologram is
proportional to the intensity of light used for recording. In a phase-modulated hologram, either the
thickness or refractive index of the photosensitive material is varied in proportion to the intensity of the
holographic pattern. A phase-modulated hologram reproduces the original wavefront when illuminated
by a reference beam.
13.8.2.2
Transmission and Reﬂection Holograms
In the case of a transmission hologram, the object and reference beams are incident on the recording
medium from the same side. During reconstruction, the typical transmission hologram is viewed with
Figure 13.34
Optical arrangement for reconstruction of hologram.
Lasers in Science and Technology
499

laser light that is usually of the same type as that used for the recording. Figure 13.35a and b illustrate the
experimental set-up for recording and reconstructing a typical transmission hologram, respectively.
In the case of a reﬂection hologram, the object and reference beams are incident on the photosensitive
material from opposite sides. The hologram is viewed from the same side from which the reference beam
is incident. The image therefore consists of light reﬂected by the hologram. Figure 13.36a and b show the
experimental set-up for the recording and reconstruction of a typical reﬂection hologram, respectively.
The reﬂection hologram allows a truly three-dimensional image to be seen near its surface and is the most
common type shown in galleries. These holograms have been made and displayed in colour with their
images optically indistinguishable from the original objects.
13.8.2.3
Thin and Thick Holograms
In the case of a thin hologram, the thickness of the photosensitive medium is much less than the spacing
of the interference fringes which make up the holographic recording. In a thick hologram (also called a
volume hologram), the thickness of the photosensitive medium is greater than the spacing of the
interference pattern, which makes the recorded hologram a three-dimensional structure. The incident

Lasers and Optoelectronics

light is diffracted only at a particular angle of illumination called the Bragg angle. If the angle of
incidence is the same as the original reference beam angle and the hologram is illuminated with a light
source having a broad spectrum of wavelengths, reconstruction occurs only at the wavelength of the
original laser used. If the angle of illumination is different, reconstruction will also occur at a different
wavelength causing the reconstructed image to appear in a different colour.
13.8.2.4
Other Commonly Encountered Holograms
Other commonly encountered holograms include embossed holograms, integral holograms, multi-
channel holograms and computer-generated holograms.
Embossed holograms are the mass-produced holograms such as those used to build security into
credit/debit cards. The original hologram is usually recorded on a photosensitive material and the
replicas are made by pressing the 2D interference pattern onto thin foils. An integral hologram is a type
of hologram that is automatically synthesized from a large collection of photographs, each taken from a
slightly different position. Multichannel holograms allow completely different images to be observed in
the same hologram with changes in the angle of the viewing light. This concept has enormous potential
for massive computer memories.
Computer-generated holograms are digitally generated holographic interference patterns. The
desired holographic image is digitally computed and then printed onto a mask or ﬁlm and displayed
by illuminating it with a suitable coherent source of light. Computer-generated holograms can be fully
synthetic holograms without the need for the object to be a physical reality.

Reﬂection hologram: (a) recording; and (b) reconstruction.
Lasers in Science and Technology
501

The whole process of computer-generated holograms involves three basic steps: computation of the
scattered wavefront of the object; encoding the wavefront data; and modulating the interference pattern
onto a coherent source of light to transport it to the user observing the hologram. Computer-generated
holograms ﬁnd extensive use as holographic optical elements (HOEs) for controlling laser light in many
optical devices for applications such as scanning, splitting and focusing.
13.8.3
Applications
Due to the versatility of their underlying technology, holograms have been exploited in a wide range of
applications in industry, scientiﬁc research, art, commerce and medicine. Applications range from the
creation of pulsed holographic portraits and other works of art to adding security features to valuable
documents; from authentication and decorative packaging of branded goods to medical diagnostics;
from imaging to data storage; and from use of holographic optical elements for various functions to non-
destructive testing to reveal structural stresses and strains without damaging the specimen.
A hologram is the established overt authentication feature incorporated into branded products and
valuable documents to prevent counterfeiting, adulteration, substitution and parallel trading. They can
also be integrated with other security technologies to provide a combination of overt and covert security
with track-and-trace capabilities. Holograms are widely used on a range of security documents such as
currency notes, ﬁscal stamps, cheques, bank cards and personal identiﬁcation documents including ID
cards, passports, and so on.
Holographic products are available in a wide variety of designs, materials and formats to interface with
existing packaging design and production processes and are extensively used for packaging and
promotion purposes to provide visual effects and brand differentiation.
HOEs are used to perform a variety of functions such as those performed by lenses, mirrors and
gratings. Holography also allows the combining of several functions, not realizable with conventional
optical elements. Some examples include bifocal contact lenses, supermarket barcode scanners and high-
resolution spectrometers. A head-up display, a holographic windshield installed in a military aircraft, is
another important application of HOEs. A holographic image of the cockpit control instrumentation
appears to ﬂoat in front of the windshield, thereby allowing the pilot to keep his eyes on the runway or the
sky while handling the controls. This feature is also now available in some of the high-end automobiles.
Holography has applications in medical diagnostics. The hologram is embedded in a smart material
capable of detecting certain molecules or metabolites. The chemical interaction between the added
molecules in the holographic ﬁlm and the molecules of interest manifests as a change in one of the
properties of the holographic reﬂection in the form of change in either fringe periodicity or refractive
index. This causes a change in the colour of the holographic reﬂection as is the case in a Bragg reﬂector.
Holographic interferometry allows the measurement of static and dynamic displacements of objects
with optically rough surfaces to a precision of a fraction of a wavelength. Holographic interferometry is
extensively used for non-destructive testing of engineering structures to measure stress, strain and
vibration. The technique has also been used to visualize ﬂuid ﬂows.
Holographic memory is the next-generation data-storage device with the ability to store 1000 GB of
data in a crystal approximately the size of a sugar cube; compare this to the 15.9-GB-capacity of a
double-sided double-layer DVD. This tremendous increase in data storage capacity is due to the fact that
holographic storage stores data throughout the volume of the medium, as opposed to only on the surface
of the recording media in conventional magnetic and optical storage technology. Data storage capacity is
further enhanced as it is capable of storing multiple data in the same area by utilizing light at different
angles. Holographic data storage also offers much higher data transfer rates as it reads millions of bits in
parallel; conventional magnetic and optical storage techniques record data 1 bit at a time in a linear
fashion.
Holography technology is advancing very rapidly and many new applications will be added to the
spectrum in the coming years. Holographic memory discussed in the preceding paragraph is also an
emerging application. Two other applications that are likely to become established by 2020 include
holographic television and optical computing. A prototype of holographic television has already been
502
Lasers and Optoelectronics

developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). By 2020, computers may not only be
using holographic displays, but may also be exploiting the principles of holography for computing using
photons instead of electrons.
13.9
Summary
 As a source of electromagnetic radiation with exceptionally high frequency stability, the laser is the
basis of length/distance metrology. Laser interferometry is at the core of length metrology, measure-
ment of time-of-ﬂight of laser pulses being the other commonly used technique. Optical frequency
metrology allows high-precision measurements of optical frequencies. The atomic clock is an
example.
 Lasers offer a non-contact methodology for precise measurement of distances and displacements.
Most common laser-based methods of determining distances and displacements include interferome-
try, the time-of-ﬂight method, the phase shift method, the triangulation method and the frequency
modulation method.
 An interferometer is an optical device that makes use of interference phenomenon. Interferometry is
particularly suited to measurement of changes in distance rather than absolute measurement of
distance.
 A Michelson interferometer uses a single-beam splitter for separating and combining the beams. It is a
very useful optical tool for the measurement of wavelength, distance, refractive index and coherence
length of optical beams.
 ATwyman–Green interferometer is essentially an adaptation of Michelson interferometer which uses
a monochromatic point source of light for characterizing optical elements such as lenses, prisms and
ﬂats.
 The Mach–Zehnder interferometer is an optical tool used to determine the relative phase shift between
two collimated beams from a coherent light source.
 The Fabry–Perot interferometer consists of two parallel optical ﬂats with partially reﬂecting mirror
surfaces facing each other. The monolithic version of the interferometer (etalon) consists of a
transparent plate with two reﬂecting surfaces. A Fabry–Perot interferometer differs from a Fabry–
Perot etalon in the fact that it allows the distance between the plates to be ﬁne tuned to make
transmission peaks correspond to the desired wavelength.
 The Sagnac interferometer is based on the Sagnac effect, which describes what happens when a ring
laser comprising two counter-propagating laser beams is rotated around an axis perpendicular to its
plane. The light beam travelling in the same direction as that of rotation experiences a longer path
length, while the light beam travelling in the opposite direction experiences a shorter path length in
one round trip. This produces a relative phase shift between the two counter-propagating beams, with
the magnitude of the phase shift being proportional to the rotation rate.
 In the time-of-ﬂight technique, the distance to an object is determined by measuring time-of-ﬂight of a
narrow laser pulse to travel to the targeted object and return after reﬂection.
 In the phase shift technique of range ﬁnding, the laser beam with sinusoidal power modulation is
transmitted towards the target and the diffused or specular reﬂection from the target is received. The
target distance is determined from the phase of the received laser beam.
 In the triangulation method, laser transmitter, laser receiver and the intended object form a triangle.
The distance to the target is determined from known values of distance between the transmitter and the
receiver and measured angles of lines joining transmitter and receiver, transmitter and object and
receiver and object.
 In the frequency modulation method, the frequency of a narrow-line-width laser is modulated with a
ramp or sinusoidal signal and then transmitted towards the target. The received signal corresponding to
the reﬂected laser beam is mixed with the reference signal. The beat frequency produced as a result of
homodyne detection is used to derive the distance information.
 The optical frequency comb technique has revolutionized optical frequency metrology. An optical
frequency comb is simply an optical spectrum consisting of equidistant lines. It overcomes the major
Lasers in Science and Technology
503

limitations of the traditional frequency chain approach to generate frequency references, which allow
frequency measurement around a single optical frequency only.
 An optical clock derives its output from an ultra-stable optical frequency standard and offers
exceptionally high precision that is far superior to the best-available caesium atomic clocks. Timing
precision of the order of 1015 can be achieved.
 The line width of a laser is an indicator of the degree of its monochromaticity and is deﬁned as the
width of its optical spectrum, measured typically as FWHM. In the case of multimode lasers with line
widths of the order of 10 GHz or more, the conventional diffraction-grating-based technique of optical
spectrum analysis may be used. For single-frequency lasers with narrower line width, the self-
heterodyne technique is often used. Line width in this case is measured as a beat frequency between
the frequency-shifted laser output and a delayed version of it.
 An infrared thermometer in its most basic form consists of a focusing optic that focuses the received
infrared energy onto a detector. It measures the temperature by detecting the infrared energy emitted
by the object and converting it into an equivalent electrical signal which, after compensation for the
ambient temperature, can be displayed in the units of temperature.
 Laser velocimetry is extensively used for measurement of one or more velocity components over one
or more dimensions. Although the most widely exploited application of laser velocimetry continues to
be in measurement of transparent and semi-transparent ﬂuid ﬂow, it has also been used for
measurement of linear or vibratory motion of opaque reﬂecting surfaces. There exist many variations
of laser veolocimetry, including laser Doppler and particle image velocimetry.
 Laser vibrometry, operationally similar to laser velocimetry, is a non-contact technique used for
measurement of surface vibrations. It also relies on the Doppler effect to extract information on
vibration amplitude and frequency from the Doppler shift undergone by the laser beam frequency due
to vibratory motion of the surface of interest.
 Electronic speckle pattern interferometry (ESPI) is an optical interferometric technique enabling
measurements of surface displacements or deformations on material surfaces caused by some kind of
loading, which could be mechanical, thermal, vibrational or pressure. ESPI has been successfully used
for the study of material properties, fatigue testing, fracture mechanics, vibrational mode analysis and
non-destructive testing of a variety of components in automotive, aerospace and electronics industry.
 Satellite laser ranging (SLR) is a technique of measuring the range of an Earth-orbiting satellite using
a laser with the objective of determining the orbital parameters of satellites and, from their variation
from predicted values, accurately determining the temporal variation of Earth’s centre of mass.
 Lasers are used in astronomy as part of an adaptive optics system to improve the image quality of
terrestrial astronomical telescopes. A laser guide star serves the purpose of an artiﬁcial source of bright
light at a location close to the astronomical object to be viewed. It is used to provide the reference
source required by the adaptive optical system to counter or nullify the effect of atmospheric
distortion.
 Holography is the technique of forming a 3D image of an object by recording on a photosensitive
material the interference pattern formed by a split laser beam. This pattern is illuminated either with a
laser or with ordinary light during the hologram reconstruction.

Military Applications: Laser
Instrumentation
14.1
Introduction
From the early 1980s, lasers have penetrated almost every conceivable area of application from
fundamental science and technology to industry, from medicine and healthcare to entertainment and
from tactical battleﬁeld to the strategic domain. The applications have grown at a very fast rate and not
just in previously existing domains; laser devices have also found their place in many new areas. Due to
the enormity of the subject and the interest it currently holds internationally, in terms of ever-increasing
usage for a variety of deployment scenarios and the types of investments being made into their research
and development, military applications of lasers and optoelectronics are covered in two chapters.
The focus in this present chapter is instrumentation and sensor military applications of lasers and
related devices such as laser rangeﬁnders, laser target designators, laser bathymetry, electro-optic
guidance techniques (including detailed description of laser-guided munitions) and infrared-guided
missiles. This chapter also focuses on important optronic sensors such as the ring laser and ﬁbre-optic
gyroscopes used for navigation. Chapter 15 focuses on the directed-energy applications of lasers and
optoelectronics devices and systems.
We begin with an introduction to military applications of lasers, highlighting major functional
disciplines including those already in use and those likely to be used in the not-too-distant future. We
focus on the requirements of the application, various technological options, current state-of-the-art and
future trends. The chapter concludes with a discussion on free space and underwater laser communica-
tion, with particular reference to their importance for military applications.
14.2
Military Applications of Lasers
While the expansion of non-military applications of lasers is primarily driven by the availability of a
large number of wavelengths as well as ever-increasing power levels and diminishing price tags at which
these wavelengths can be generated, military applications of lasers and related electro-optic devices have
grown mainly because of technological maturity of the lasers that were introduced in the late 1960s and
early 1970s. Technological advances in optics, optoelectronics and electronics leading to more rugged,
reliable, compact and efﬁcient laser devices are largely responsible for making them indispensable in
modern warfare. Laser systems developed for existing military applications also continue to improve in
terms of performance speciﬁcations and system engineering. Much work is being conducted, particularly
in technologically advanced countries, to exploit the potential of lasers and optoelectronic devices in
newer areas.

The most common tactical battleﬁeld applications of lasers and optoelectronic devices are as laser
rangeﬁnders and laser target designators for munitions guidance. A modern battleﬁeld tank whose ﬁre
control system does not utilize the services of a laser rangeﬁnder cannot be imagined; this is also true for
other forms of armoured ﬁghting vehicles. Short-range semiconductor diode-laser-based rangeﬁnders
are used on squad weapons such as assault riﬂes and light machine guns (Figure 14.1).
A laser target designator is an essential component of laser-guided munitions delivery systems,
although there are other forms of electro-optic guidance such as that employed in the case of infrared-
guided missiles. Laser-guided munitions, including bombs, projectiles and missiles, constitute an
important class of precision-strike weapons and the laser target designator plays a key role in the
overall delivery system. While a laser target designator is the key element of a laser-guided munitions
delivery system, an optical-gyroscope-based inertial sensor such as ring laser gyroscopes (RLGs) and
ﬁbre-optic gyroscopes ﬁnd extensive use in navigation systems of commercial airliners, ships, space-
craft, military aircraft and ballistic missiles.
There are other military applications that exploit the principles of laser rangeﬁnding and target
designation. Laser-based proximity sensors, gap-measuring devices and obstacle-avoidance systems are
some examples where the laser rangeﬁnding principle is put to use. Laser tracking is another example
where a laser target designator/rangeﬁnder mounted on a two-axis gimbal platform can be used to
determine the 3D coordinates of a remote target and to track it.
Another application of the basic laser range-ﬁnding principle is in laser bathymetry. Laser bathymetry
is a swath surveying technique that is complementary to conventional multibeam acoustic systems. Laser
bathymetry is particularly attractive for surveying shallow coastal waters where the acoustic technique is
not very effective due to limited swath width. With the arrival of airborne laser bathymetry systems that
survey at aircraft speed and are effective in shallow and shoal-infested waters, laser bathymetry has
become the ideal complement to acoustic swath mapping of coastal waters. Airborne laser bathymetry
also offers a swath width that is independent of water depth.
Laser pointing is another common application. Small low-cost low-power semiconductor diode laser
modules with provision of precise x–y movement are ﬁnding widespread use on squad weapons for target
aiming and pointing, particularly during night-time operations. This increases weapon effectiveness by
improving the single-shot hit probability and reducing collateral damage. Figure 14.2 shows the
photograph of one such module, mounted on a rifﬂe. These modules are generally integrated with
the weapon through Picatinny or universal rails.

Relatively newer types of laser systems that have found widespread recognition from the armed forces
are the systems that can offer effective countermeasures against systems already in use. A typical electro-
optic countermeasure (EOCM) system aims to provide protection to the military platform from laser-
guided munitions attack. The EOCM system essentially comprises a laser warning system that provides
information on the type and angle-of-arrival of laser threat and a suitable interface to a countermeasures
system. The countermeasures system is either in the form of a smoke/aerosol screening system to block
laser radiation or a high-energy laser system that can be used to neutralize the source of laser radiation,
that is, laser target designator or seeker head of laser-guided munitions.
Lasers and optoelectronics devices and systems have also found widespread use in low-intensity
conﬂict (LIC) operations. Many of the established military technologies and systems are being adapted
for use in LIC scenarios. A low-intensity conﬂict is the most common form of warfare today and is likely
to be so in the foreseeable future. Low-intensity conﬂict poses an alarming threat to national security and
is an area of concern for the whole of the international community today. Its scope extends from
emergency preparedness and response to domestic intelligence activities to riot and mob control; from
combating illegal drug trafﬁcking to protection of critical infrastructure; from handling counter-
insurgency and anti-terrorist operations to detection of nuclear and biological agents; and from detection
and identiﬁcation of explosive agents to detection of concealed weapons.
Laser and optoelectronics technologies play an important role in handling low-intensity conﬂict
situations. The key advantage of the use of laser technology in such applications mainly stems from its
near-zero collateral damage, speed of light delivery and potential for building non-lethal weapons. Some
of the well-established laser devices in LIC applications include laser dazzlers for close combat
operations, mob/riot control and protection of critical infrastructures from aerial threats; lidar sensors for
detection of chemical, biological and explosive agents; femtosecond lasers for imaging of concealed
weapons; and lasers for sniper and gun ﬁre location identiﬁcation.
Use of laser vibrometry and electron speckle interferometry techniques for detection of buried mines
and high-power lasers for the disposal of unexploded ordnances are emerging applications of laser
technology for homeland security. Figure 14.3 is a photograph of a laser dazzler (Model CHP Laser
DazzlerTM from M/s LE Systems Inc). This compact and handheld laser dazzler is conﬁgured around a
500 mW, 532 nm laser that is reportedly capable of causing vision impairment of the subject at a distance
even in bright ambient conditions and is eye safe for speciﬁed non-ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and
exposure time.
The last one decade or so has seen the emergence of some new potential areas of laser systems usage.
The initial uses of lasers in defence as outlined above were in the form of devices such as laser pointers,
laser rangeﬁnders and target designators for enhancing the accuracy of the conventional weapon
systems. Due to the unique nature of laser light, namely its coherence, monochromaticity, high degree of
collimation and high intensity, it was also considered as a potent weapon system for directed-energy
Figure 14.2

Lasers and Optoelectronics

applications. For these applications, the lethal laser energy is delivered to the target to cause some form
of physical destruction or neutralize electro-optic sensors used on the target platforms. The main
advantages with laser weapons are speed of light delivery, unlimited re-ﬁring capability and reduced
logistic support requirements. Such weapons can be grouped in two main categories based on the desired
effect on the target: non-lethal laser weapons and lethal laser weapons. Lethal systems are commonly
known by the name of laser-based directed-energy weapons (L-DEW). There are three major categories
of directed-energy weapons: microwave-based DEW, laser-based DEW and particle beam weapons. A
description of microwave-based DEWand particle beam weapons is beyond the scope of the present text.
Directed-energy laser weapons are systems designed for causing physical destruction of the target.
The main use of these weapons is in providing air defence, where they aim to destroy the incoming
munitions or aircraft before they can accomplish their mission. In such applications, the laser weapons
are seen as the only solution to counter multiple simultaneous threats that would normally saturate the
conventional air defence based on anti-aircraft guns and missiles.
The heart of laser-based DEW is a high-power laser, which has enough power in the case of CW lasers
or sufﬁcient pulse energy in the case of pulsed lasers, to inﬂict physical damage to the target. A target
tracking and beam pointing subsystem is the other important component of the DEW system. These
weapons are projected to play an increasingly dominant role in the future, rendering conventional high-
tech weaponry obsolete. These weapons will begin to ﬁnd use on land-based, ship-borne and aerial
platforms for a range of surface-to-surface, surface-to-air and air-to-ground tactical applications.
Tactical high-energy laser (THEL), a joint venture of the USA and Israel, is a tactical air defence
system for use against rockets. Figure 14.4 is a photograph of the THEL system. The mobile version of
THEL, also known as M-THEL, conﬁgured on three vehicular platforms has also been developed and
successfully tested.
Another important area of military application of lasers is in secure point-to-point communication
links. Free-space laser communication offers the inherent advantages of being hard to intercept, thus
providing security. Free space here means communication in air, outer space, vacuum or any similar
medium. It is comparatively easy to encrypt data travelling across a free-space laser communication link,
further enhancing data security which is an important consideration for military communications. Other
advantages include higher immunity to electromagnetic interference compared to microwaves, higher
data and lower bit error rates, full duplex operation, protocol transparency and additional security
provided by narrowness and directionality of laser beam. Laser communication also suffers from certain
limitations however, which includes signal attenuation caused by beam dispersion, atmospheric

Military Applications: Laser Instrumentation
511

absorption, scintillation and shadowing and pointing instability. All these factors lead to an increased bit
error rate. These disadvantages are however outweighed by the signiﬁcantly enhanced security provided
by laser communications when considered in the requirements of military communication. Designers
have found solutions to overcome these problems by employing multibeam or multipath architectures.
Free-space communication is particularly attractive for communication in space such as satellite-to-
satellite communication links, due to the absence of primary attenuation factors.
Laser communication is also attractive for underwater applications where operation in the blue-green
wavelength region of the electromagnetic spectrum provides a high-speed communication link between
submarines. Such a communication link overcomes data rate limitations of the existing acoustic
communication systems due to multipath propagation, time variations of the channel, small available
bandwidth and strong signal attenuation. Laser communication using the blue-green laser wavelength
region has also become a viable system for providing communication between airborne or spaceborne
platforms (such as aircraft and satellites) and submarines.
14.3 
Laser-based Instrumentation
Laser-based instrumentation relates to those systems used for performing a measurement or sensor
function. Common military applications of lasers covered in this section include laser devices and
systems used to point or designate a target to enhance the aiming accuracy of the weapon, laser
rangeﬁnders used as standalone devices for determining the target range and also as an integral part of a
ﬁre control system, and related devices such as proximity sensors, a laser target designator used as a part
of laser-guided munitions delivery system, laser-based tracking and imaging systems, laser bathymetry
for swath mapping of large bodies of water, particularly the coastal waters, and lidar (light detection and
ranging) sensors for detection and identiﬁcation of chemical, biological and explosive agents.
14.3.1 
Laser Aiming Modules
A very common application of a laser device when attached to a ﬁrearm is as an aiming device. Laser
aiming modules are usually conﬁgured around low-power semiconductor diode lasers emitting in the
Figure 14.4 
Tactical high-energy laser (THEL) (Public domain) Reproduced from public domain (http://en.
wikipedia.org/wiki/File:THEL-ACTD.jpg).
512
Lasers and Optoelectronics

visible or infrared. The CW power level is in the range 5–10 mW. Most laser aiming modules use red
laser diodes emitting at either 635 nm or 650 nm. Green diode-pumped solid-state laser technology
emitting at 532 nm is also presently in use. One of the limitations of using visible lasers for aiming and
targeting is that it is visible to the naked eye, and thus inhibits a covert operation. Laser aiming modules
conﬁgured around infrared diodes to produce an aim point on the target invisible to the naked human eye
are now available. These aim points are detectable with night vision devices usually ﬁtted to the ﬁrearm.
The aiming module is aligned to emit a laser beam parallel to the barrel. Due to an extremely low value
of divergence of the emitted laser beam, it makes a very small spot even at long distances of up to
hundreds of metres. As an illustration, full-angle divergence of 0.5 mrad would produce a spot diameter
of 50 mm at 100 m distance to target. The user places the spot on the desired target and the barrel of the
gun is aligned, not necessarily allowing for bullet drop, windage, distance between the direction of the
beam and barrel axis and the target mobility during travel time of bullet.
Dual-wavelength laser aiming devices emitting at a visible wavelength (usually red) and a near-infrared
wavelength are also commercially available. These modules are equipped with a mode select switch that
allows the user to select either of the wavelengths at a time or both wavelengths simultaneously. Some
devicesare also equippedwitha mechanismtoprovide adjustmentforwindageandelevation. One example
of such an aiming device is Laser Aiming Module, Model: LAM-10 M from M/s Newcon Optik.
Figure 14.5 is a photograph of a LAM-10 M laser aiming module. The module offers a visibility range
of greater than 1000 m, both infrared (830–850 nm) and visible (650 nm) wavelengths of operation, beam
divergence of 0.5 mrad and windage/elevation adjustmentof  20 mrad.It offers two modes of operation at
high output powerformaximumdistance and low powertomaximize batterylife.Itmay bementioned here
that most devices intended for a similar role have comparable technical speciﬁcations.
14.3.2
Laser Rangeﬁnders
A laser rangeﬁnder is used in a military application to determine distance to the intended target. It is used
both as a standalone device as well as an integral part of a ﬁre control system of main battle tanks and
other armoured ﬁghting vehicles. Laser rangeﬁnders are available in a wide range of performance
speciﬁcations in terms of operational range, range accuracy, size and weight to suit different application
and platform requirements. Laser rangeﬁnders are conﬁgured around different types of lasers including
Nd:YAG, Nd:Glass, Er:Glass and semiconductor diode lasers. These are discussed later in Section
14.3.2.5. Commonly used techniques for determination of range include time-of-ﬂight principle,
Figure 14.5

Military Applications: Laser Instrumentation
513

triangulation method and multiple-frequency phase-shift method. These are all discussed in detail in
terms of their operational principle and salient features in the following sections.
14.3.2.1
Time-of-Flight Technique
In the time-of-ﬂight technique, a narrow-pulse-width laser beam is transmitted towards the intended
target. The target range is measured from the time taken by the laser pulse to travel to the target and back
as shown in Figure 14.6. Target range or distance to target d is given by Equation 14.1:
d ¼ c  Dt=2
(14.1)
where
d
¼ target range (m)
c
¼ speed of light ¼ 3  108 m s1
Dt ¼ time interval between transmitted and received laser pulses
Range accuracy in this case depends on the receiver processing speed and rise and fall time of the laser
pulses. Range here is measured as the time interval between the rising or falling edge of the transmitted
pulse and the corresponding edge of the received pulse. Uncertainty due to ﬁnite values of rise or fall time
causes range inaccuracy. The received pulse is processed in a high-speed counter and clock speed
determines the processing speed. The time interval and hence range to target is measured in terms of the
number of clock pulses counted by the time interval counter, started by the start pulse corresponding to
the leading or trailing edge of transmitted laser pulse and stopped by the stop pulse corresponding to the
leading or trailing edge of the relevant received pulse. In terms of number of clock cycles, distance to
target is given by Equation 14.2:
d ¼ cN
2f clk
(14.2)
where N is the number of clock pulses counted between start and stop signals and fclk is the clock
frequency. Range inaccuracy in this case is given by c/2fclk.
The worst-case range inaccuracy equals one clock period. Range resolution is determined by the laser
pulse width, which implies that the laser rangeﬁnder based on time-of-ﬂight principle cannot discrimi-
nate between two targets separated in radial range by a distance corresponding to the distance travelled
by light in a time period equal to pulse width.
Figure 14.6
Time-of-ﬂight principle of measuring target range.
514
Lasers and Optoelectronics

Example 14.1
A laser rangerﬁnder operating on time-of-ﬂight principle measures target range as 5.46 km. If the
operating clock frequency is 50 MHz, determine the number of clock cycles the rangeﬁnder counter
would have recorded for this measurement. Also determine the range of distance in which the true range
is likely to be.
Solution
 Measured target range, d ¼ cN
2f clk
¼ 3  108  N/(2  50  106) ¼ 3N
 Therefore, 3N ¼ 5.46  103 and the number of clock cycles N ¼ 1820
 Also, worst-case range inaccuracy ¼ c/2fclk ¼ 3  108/(2  50  106) ¼ 3 m.
 Therefore, true range is 5.457–5.463 km.
14.3.2.2
Triangulation Technique
In the triangulation technique, range is determined by using simple laws of trigonometry. The principle
of operation can be best explained with the help of Figure 14.7. In Figure 14.7, laser transmitter is
located at point A, laser receiver is located at point B and point C indicates the target location. The
distance-to-target d from the laser transmitter location can be computed from known values of length l
and angles a and b using Equation 14.2:
d ¼ l 
sin b
sin a þ b
ð
Þ
(14.3)
The above equation is valid in ﬂat or Euclidean geometry. The computed results become inaccurate if
distances are appreciable compared to the curvature of the Earth. In that case, more complicated
expressions derived using spherical trigonometry should be used.
Example 14.2
In a range measurement experiment using the triangulation method, the transmitter and receiver are
separated by 10 m. The angles that the lines of sight between target and transmitter and target and
receiver make with the line joining transmitter and receiver are measured as 85 and 90, respectively.
Determine the measured distance to the target.

Solution
 The distance to target d can be computed from d ¼ l 
sin b

ð

 a ¼ 85, b ¼ 90 and l ¼ 10 m.
 Therefore, d ¼ 10  sin 90/sin (85 þ 90) ¼ 10/sin 175 ¼ 10/0.087 ¼ 115 m.
14.3.2.3
Phase Shift Technique
In the phase shift technique of range ﬁnding, the laser beam with sinusoidal power modulation is
transmitted towards the target and the diffused or specular reﬂection from the target is received. The
phase of the received laser beam is measured and compared with that of the transmitted laser beam. The
phase shift is 2p times the product of the time-of-ﬂight and modulation frequency. This allows us to
compute the time-of-ﬂight and hence the distance to the target from known values of phase shift and
modulation frequency. Higher-modulation frequencies can result in a higher spatial resolution. The
phase shift method appears similar to the time-of-ﬂight method, as the phase shift is proportional to the
time-of-ﬂight. However, time-of-ﬂight conventionally refers to the technique where the time delay is
measured more directly. In the case of the phase shift method, the range measurement is ambiguous as
phase shift varies periodically with increasing distance. This ambiguity can be removed by measuring
phase shift at two different frequencies.
14.3.2.4
FM-CW Range-ﬁnding Technique
The frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FM-CW) laser range-ﬁnding technique is similar to that
followed in the case of its radar counterpart, that is, FM-CW radar. The frequency of a narrow-line-width
laser is modulated with a ramp or sinusoidal signal, collimated and then transmitted towards to the target.
The received signal corresponding to the reﬂected laser beam, specular or diffused, is mixed with the
reference signal representing the transmitted laser beam. The beat frequency produced as a result of
homodyne detection is used to derive the range information. Figure 14.8a shows the basic block
schematic arrangement of a FM-CW laser rangeﬁnder. Figure 14.8b shows the frequency variation in
transmitted and received laser signals as a function of time when the transmitted laser is modulated by a
ramp signal. Received signal is time-delayed from the transmitted signal as shown in the ﬁgure. The time
delay and the corresponding beat frequency represent distance to target. The ﬁgure also shows beat
frequency as a function of time. The beat frequency is measured in the portion where it is constant with
respect to time and not in the transient region. The distance to target d is given by Equation 14.4:
d ¼ f BcTR
4Df
(14.4)
where fB is the beat frequency, TR is the ramp waveform time period and Df is modulation frequency
bandwidth.
Minimum measurable range in this technique corresponds to half the period of the beat frequency
signal. Maximum measurable range equals half the distance travelled by light in half the time period
of the ramp signal. Minimum and maximum ranges are given by Equations 14.6 and 14.7,
respectively:
dmin ¼
c

(14.5)
dmax ¼ cTR

(14.6)
The measurement range and sensitivity in this case depends on the line width or coherence length of
the laser. With a line width of a few kilohertz, it is possible to achieve a range of several hundred
kilometres with an accuracy of better than 1.0 m. FM-CW laser rangeﬁnders implemented with narrow-

line-width ﬁbre laser sources offer signiﬁcant improvement in dynamic range, sensitivity, compactness,
ruggedness and mounting ﬂexibility.
Example 14.3
An FM-CW type of laser rangeﬁnder uses a ramp-modulated narrow-line-width laser beam. The ramp
frequency is 1 kHz and laser line width is 20 kHz. While measuring a designated target range with this
rangeﬁnder, beat frequency is measured to be 450 kHz. If the modulation bandwidth of the system is
3 MHz, determine target range. Also ﬁnd the minimum and maximum range-measuring capability of the
system.

Lasers for Laser Rangeﬁnders
Different types of laser sources have been exploited to build laser rangeﬁnders for military applications.
These include different types of solid-state lasers, semiconductor diode lasers, ﬁbre lasers and CO2
lasers.
Laser rangeﬁnders used on land-based platforms, either in a standalone mode or as a part of integrated
ﬁre control system, are usually low-repetition-rate systems producing laser pulses in the range 5–30 ppm
(pulses per minute) and are conﬁgured around Q-switched Nd:YAG or Nd:Glass lasers. These are
capable of ranging up to a target range of 25 km with accuracy better than 5 m and are available as
compact, handheld devices similar in appearance to a pair of binoculars. Figure 14.9 is photograph of one
such laser rangeﬁnder, Model LH-30 manufactured by Bharat Electronics. This handheld Nd:YAG laser
rangeﬁnder has a maximum operational range of 20 km with range accuracy speciﬁcation of 5 m. Other
features include beam divergence of 1.0 mrad, pulse repetition rate options of 10 and 30 ppm, pulse
energy of 6–12 mJ, built-in magniﬁcation of 6  , RS-422A serial interface and remote triggering and
bite readout.
Another class of rangeﬁnders that combine the functions of target designation and range ﬁnding or
that form the subsystem of a tracking system have relatively much higher repetition rates in the range of
10–50 pps (pulses per second). The inter-pulse period in this case depends upon the speed of the target to
be tracked. These are invariably Q-switched Nd:YAG lasers, primarily due to the signiﬁcantly superior

Electronics Ltd.).

thermal conductivity speciﬁcation of YAG as compared to glass as a host material. These lasers are not
only becoming smaller in size, but are now available with many additional features to give them in-built
countermeasure capability against similar systems deployed by the adversary in an electro-optic
countermeasure role.
Nd:YAG and Nd:Glass rangeﬁnders emit at 1064 nm, which has a serious eye hazard. Personnel using
these devices are at risk of being exposed to this hazardous radiation, and need to protect their eyes while
using them to avoid scattered radiation falling onto their eyes and causing serious damage. Eye
protection comes in the form of safety goggles, which attenuate the laser radiation to an absolutely safe
level. This has led to the development of eye-safe laser rangeﬁnders and target designators. The low-
repetition-rate class of rangeﬁnders discussed earlier is being gradually replaced by eye-safe versions.
One of the techniques is to use a different active medium that emits an eye-safe wavelength. Er:
Glass is one such active medium and Er:Glass lasers emit at 1540 nm, a wavelength safe for human
eyes. Figure 14.10 is a photograph of one such eye-safe laser rangeﬁnder, having an operational range
of 25 km and a range accuracy of 5 m.
The high-repetition-rate variety of eye-safe laser rangeﬁnders is not possible with Er:Glass lasers due
to the poor thermal conductivity characteristics of the glass host. Several non-linear techniques
have been successfully used in conjunction with Nd:YAG lasers to generate eye-safe wavelengths.
Raman-shifted YAG and OPO-based YAG have emerged as very strong contenders for building
high-repetition-rate laser sources.
Another laser type exploited as a rangeﬁnder is the RF-excited waveguide CO2 laser. Advances in
waveguide geometry and RF components have resulted in development of compact laser sources
emitting at 10.6 mm. Rangeﬁnders built using these lasers perform much better in adverse climatic
conditions as compared to their counterparts operating at 1064 nm.
14.3.2.6
Applications and Related Devices
Laser rangeﬁnders ﬁnd extensive use as standalone devices for the purpose of observation and situational
awareness of adversary movement of personnel and military assets. Most armoured ﬁghting platforms
are equipped with a laser rangeﬁnder. While the basic rangeﬁnder can be used to ﬁnd target range, when
combined with a digital magnetic compass and inclinometer it can also be used to determine target
coordinates. The other important application of a laser rangeﬁnder is in integrated ﬁre control system of
armoured ﬁghting platforms. When interfaced with a ﬁre control computer, target accuracy is
signiﬁcantly enhanced. Modern ﬁre control systems of all main battle tanks today are invariably
laser-rangeﬁnder assisted. When interfaced with night vision, thermal and daytime optical aids, laser

rangeﬁnders represent a useful and effective battleﬁeld asset for observation, surveillance and situational
awareness.
A high-repetition-rate laser rangeﬁnder in a target designator is used for munitions guidance. They are
also at the heart of laser trackers and 3D scanners. Other prominent systems with a laser rangeﬁnder at
their core include laser proximity sensors, laser bathymetric sensors, lidar and 3D imaging seekers.
14.3.3
Laser Target Designators
In military parlance, laser designation of targets is carried out for the guidance of laser-guided bombs,
missiles and projectiles. The Paveway series of bombs and Lockheed-Martin’s Hellﬁre missiles, both
launched from aerial platforms, and canon-launched Copperhead projectiles are some examples of laser-
guided munitions that require precise laser designation of the intended target.
A laser target designator for munitions guidance application is a high-repetition-rate Q-switched laser
source whose pulse repetition frequency is coded in order to allow only a speciﬁc target designator and
laser seeker combination to work in unison for the intended mission. This also allows multiple targets to
be hit at the same time when illuminated by different target designators, in addition to giving the delivery
system a countermeasure capability.
Modern laser target designators use Q-switched Nd:YAG laser source and operate at 1064 nm. All
target designators have a range-ﬁnding channel either at the same wavelength of 1064 nm or at an eye-
safe wavelength of 1540 nm. It may be mentioned here that the range-ﬁnding channel of almost all
modern laser target designators uses an eye-safe wavelength of 1540 nm. The system is equipped with a
suitable sighting system and a digital magnetic compass. It is mounted on a suitable angular platform.
There is also trend towards building eye-safe laser target designators in the coming years; this would
however necessitate a change of laser seeker heads, which have a spectral response to cover 1540 nm.
This implies that the seekers would need to employ indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) based sensors
rather than silicon-based sensors. Laser guidance principles are discussed in detail in Section 14.4.2.
Laser target designators for handheld applications as well as for land-based and aerial platforms are
available. Typical performance speciﬁcations of laser target designators for munitions guidance
applications include pulse energy in the range of 50–120 mJ, pulse width in the range of 5–50 ns,
pulse repetition frequency 5–20 Hz and laser beam divergence of 0.1–0.5 mrad. One such portable laser
target designator is Model AN/PEQ-17 from M/s Elbit Systems, described earlier in Chapter 3 on solid-
state lasers and depicted here in Figure 14.11.
Airborne laser target designators often form a part of a targeting pod. Targeting pods are basically
target designation tools used for identiﬁcation of ground targets and guiding munitions to their intended
targets. Targeting pods are equipped with other electro-optic systems such as a laser spot tracker to locate
the laser pulses reﬂected from the designated target or/and laser rangeﬁnder to determine target range. In
some cases, same sensor performs the functions of laser spot tracking and range ﬁnding. These systems
are known as laser ranger and marked target seekers (LRMTS). Some targeting pods are equipped with a
laser target designator to designate its own targets or for other friendly units.
Raphael’s Litening targeting pod is an example, depicted by Figure 14.12. A Litening targeting pod
contains a high-resolution forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor to provide an infrared image of the
target with a wide ﬁeld-of-view search capability and a narrow ﬁeld-of-view acquisition and targeting
capability, a CCD camera to produce target imagery in the visible portion of the electromagnetic
spectrum, a navigation sensor on gimbal for automatic bore-sighting capability, a laser target designator
for precise delivery of laser-guided munitions and a rangeﬁnder.
14.3.4
Laser Proximity Sensors
A laser proximity sensor is a type of laser rangeﬁnder designed to accurately measure relatively smaller
distances to a target compared to those encountered in conventional laser rangeﬁnders used for
observation and surveillance and ﬁre control. While a conventional battleﬁeld laser rangeﬁnder measures
distance to target and the range information is displayed to the observer, in the case of a proximity sensor
the processing circuitry generates a command signal when the distance to target is equal to the preset
520
Lasers and Optoelectronics

distance value within a certain speciﬁed tolerance. The command signal in turn could be used to perform
a variety of control functions. In military parlance, the most common application of a proximity sensor is
in a laser proximity fuse where the command signal is used to initiate detonation of warheads of large
artillery shells, aviation bombs and guided missiles.
Laser-based methods of determining target range are discussed in Section 14.3.2 on laser rangeﬁnders.
Theoretically, all the previously described range-ﬁnding techniques (time-of-ﬂight, triangulation, phase
shift and FM-CW techniques) can be used to build laser proximity sensors or laser proximity fuses. The
optimum method for a given application however depends on the maximum range and range accuracy
requirement of the intended application. The triangulation technique is much better suited to the design
of laser proximity sensors or fuses, as it is capable of measuring shorter distances up to few metres with
high accuracy. The range accuracy however falls off rapidly with increasing distance.

Figure 14.13 shows the basic principle of operation of a laser proximity sensor. The sensor has a
transmitting channel usually conﬁgured around a semiconductor diode laser or a passively Q-switched
diode-pumped solid-state microchip laser along with associated transmit optics and a receiving channel
comprising receiving optics, PIN or APD sensor and range processing circuitry.
As shown in the ﬁgure, the transmitted laser beam reﬂected from the target located at three different
distances produces the beam images that are displaced across the active area of the photosensor. The
receiver is designed to produce the focused laser beam spot at the centre of the active area for a preset
value of proximity distance. There will be a distance both longer and shorter than the desired distance,
where the focused beam spot falls just outside the active area. This forms the basis of the operation of
laser proximity sensor in general and laser proximity fuse in particular.
The performance of a laser proximity sensor can be enhanced by using an axially symmetric
arrangement of multiple aperture photosensor as shown in Figure 14.14. The design offers better
ballistics due to centre of gravity being located on the longitudinal axis of the ammunition round and
higher signal-to-noise ratio due to averaging of multiple return signals.

Laser Bathymetry Sensors
Hydrographic surveying and nautical charting are important for safe navigation in coastal waters and are
therefore important not only for worldwide maritime commerce but also for military applications.
Acoustic-based bathymetry and laser bathymetry are the two established techniques for the purpose.
Laser bathymetry is the technique of measuring depths of water bodies, usually relatively shallow coastal
waters, using a scanning pulsed laser beam. Measurement is usually done from an airborne platform,
which gives it the name airborne laser bathymetry (ALB).
Laser bathymetry makes use of the transmissive and reﬂective properties of water and of the bottom of
the water body to measure the depth. The measurement of depth relies on the differential timing of the
laser pulses reﬂected from the surface of the water body and those reﬂected from the bottom.
Laser bathymetry from an airborne platform offers distinct advantages over the conventional vessel-
mounted acoustic sensor technology, as the latter provides a swath coverage that is approximately twice the
water depth. As a result, it offers limited swath coverage in shallow waters of coastal zones, as illustrated in
Figure 14.16. Acoustic technology is also vulnerable in shoal-infected waters; it is therefore more suitable
for deep waters. Airborne laser bathymetry offers the complimentary capabilities of high coverage rates in
shallow waters, seamless data acquisition across land/sea interface and rapid deployment.
When the laser beam from the airborne platform hits the water column, a fraction of the incident laser
energy is reﬂected off the surface and the remaining energy is mostly transmitted through the column.
The laser beam transmitting through the water column suffers attenuation due to absorption, scattering
and refraction. This limits the maximum measurable water depth. Maximum measurable depth by laser
bathymetry depends on water clarity, and is generally three times the Sechhi depth. (Sechhi depth is an
old method of quantifying water clarity and is equal to the depth at which a standard black and white disc
is no longer visible to the naked eye.)
Figure 14.17 shows the operational concept of a typical airborne laser bathymetry system. The laser
transmitter sends out two collinear pulsed laser beams simultaneously, one at a near-infrared wavelength
(usually 1064 nm) and the other at 532 nm. The two pulsed laser beams strike the surface of water
column at the same point and at the same time. The near-infrared beam is specularly reﬂected from the
water surface. A part of it enters the receiver, which measures its intensity and time instant of arrival with
reference to the time instant of the transmitted pulse train. The small fraction that is transmitted is
absorbed within a few centimetres of the water column. In the case of green laser at 532 nm, most of it

Lasers and Optoelectronics

penetrates the water column and only a small fraction is specularly reﬂected. The fraction of green laser
reaching the water column bed undergoes diffused reﬂection. After diffused reﬂection, it travels upwards
through the water column and only a small fraction of it reaches the receiver within its ﬁeld of view. The
receiver measures the intensity and time instant of arrival again with reference to the transmitted pulse
train. The water depth is computed from the difference in the round-trip propagation time of the surface
reﬂected laser beam at 1064 nm and the one at 532 nm reﬂected off the bottom of the water body.
The whole process of transmission, reception and signal processing is far more complex than it
appears from the basic description presented here. For example, in a practical system, specular
reﬂection of the laser beam from the water surface is usual when the conditions are windy, as these
conditions lead to formation of small capillary waves that act like mirror facets. In calm conditions,
the surface acts like one large mirror, thus directing the reﬂection away from the sensor. It may be
mentioned here that the transmitted laser beam makes an angle of about 20 with respect to the
vertical. In calm conditions, the system depends on Raman scattering and ﬂuorescence signals from
the water volume just beneath the surface and uses an off-wavelength receiver to generate the received
signal. The green laser beam hitting the surface is also refracted by about 15 depending on the
surface wave structure at the time of impact. The sensor also needs to take into account the refraction
effect while computing the water depth.

Armed forces around the world have equipped themselves with airborne laser bathymetry systems
over the years for a range of applications. Some of these include acquisition of CZMIL system by US
Navy in 2012 and US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) in 2011, SHOALS (scanning hydrographic
operational airborne laser survey) 3000 by Military Survey Department of UAE in 2010, SHOALS 3000
TH by US Navy in 2005, SHOALS 1000T by US Army Corps in 2003, SHOALS 1000 by Japan Coast
Guard in 2003, Hawkeye by Swedish Navy in 1995, SHOALS 200 by US Army Corps of Engineers in
1994, ALARMS by DARPA in 1988 and FLASH by Swedish Defence Research Institute in 1988.
The SHOALS system from Optech Incorporated, Canada is a commonly used airborne laser
bathymetry system. Different variants of the system in SHOALS-200, SHOALS-1000 and
SHOALS-3000 have found themselves on the inventory of armed forces over the years as outlined
above. The system meets International Hydrographic Organisation (ISO) Order 2 requirements for
accuracy. The system offers depth measurement accuracy of better than 20 cm and horizontal positioning
accuracy of better than 1.5 m. With its special shoreline depths processing mode, SHOALS can provide
continuous topographic and bathymetric mapping through the shoreline from water onto land. The
maximum depth measuring capability of the system is 40–50 m in clear ocean waters, 20–40 m in coastal
waters and less than 20 m in more turbid inland waters. Other factors that limit the system depth
measuring capability and accuracy include high surface waves, heavy fog and precipitation, sun glint,
heavy bottom vegetation and ﬂuid mud.
14.3.6
Laser Radar (Ladar) Sensors
Laser radar, also called ladar (laser detection and ranging), uses a laser beam instead of microwaves, that
is, the transmitted electromagnetic energy lies in the optical spectrum in laser radars. The frequencies
associated with laser radars are very high ranging from 30–300 THz and the corresponding wavelengths
from 10–1.0 mm. The higher operating frequency means higher operating bandwidth, greater time or
range resolution and enhanced angular resolution. Another advantage of laser radars compared to
microwave radars is their immunity to jamming. The higher frequencies associated with laser radars
permit detection of smaller objects. This is made possible by the fact that laser radar output wavelengths
are much smaller than the smallest-sized practical objects. In other words, the laser radar cross-section of
a given object would be much larger than the microwave radar cross-section of the same. Rain droplets
and airborne aerosols have a signiﬁcantly larger laser radar cross-section, allowing their range and
velocity measurement which is very important for many meteorological applications. The higher
resolution of laser radar allows recognition and identiﬁcation of certain unique target features such
as target shape, size, velocity, spin and vibration, which forms the basis of their use for target imaging
and tracking applications.
Although there are numerous advantages that laser radars offer over microwave radars, laser radars are
severely affected by adverse weather conditions. The narrow beam width of laser radars is also not
conducive to surveillance applications. For surveillance applications, the laser radar needs to operate at
very high repetition rates so that large volumes can be interrogated within the prescribed time.
Alternatively, multiple simultaneous beams can be used.
Laser rangeﬁnders, discussed in Section 14.3.2, are also a type of laser radar. A conventional laser
rangeﬁnder uses incoherent or direct detection, but the term laser radar is usually associated with systems
that use coherent detection. Figure 14.18 shows the block schematic arrangement of the coherent laser
radar. The laser beam is transmitted towards the target, and a fraction of the transmitted power/energy
reﬂected from the target is collected by the receiver. The block diagram shown in Figure 14.18 is that of a
monostatic system in which transmitter and receiver share common optics, made possible by the use of a
transmit-to-receive switch. In a bistatic arrangement, transmitting and receiving optics are separate; the
received laser beam is coherently detected in an optical mixer.
In the case of homodyne detection, a sample of the transmitted laser power is used as a local oscillator.
In the case of heterodyne detection, another phase-locked-to-transmit laser is used as local oscillator.
Heterodyne detection is used when transmitter and receiver are not collocated. The output of the optical
mixer is imaged onto the photosensor. The electrical signal generated by the photosensor module is
526
Lasers and Optoelectronics

processed to extract the desired information about the target. The photosensor module is a single sensor in
the case of a scanning transmitted beam and a 2D array of sensors for the ﬂash-type laser imaging radar.
Figure 14.19 illustrates the concept of a ﬂash-type 3D laser imaging radar. In this case, a diverging
pulsed laser beam illuminates the entire scene of interest. The transmitted pulse time is referenced by an
auxiliary photosensor. The backscattered light is imaged onto a 2D array of photosensing elements called
pixels. While a conventional camera measures the light intensity of the backscattered light pulse, in this
case different sensor elements in the array measure time-of-ﬂight. The time-of-ﬂight is proportional to
the distance between the point on the target from where the laser beam is reﬂected and the sensor
element. The sensor array therefore produces a 3D image of the target (angle-angle-range). An
alternative approach to generating a target image is to use a scanning laser beam and a single sensor.

A common application of the ladar concept is in ladar seekers, used mainly in conjunction with other
guidance systems on strategic payloads for intended target discrimination from advanced decoys and aim
point selection. It is also well suited for combat identiﬁcation, navigation of autonomous vehicles and
topography. Ladar is also suitable for ﬁnding targets hidden by camouﬂage nets and foliage. A ladar
seeker can detect and identify speciﬁc features of the target with very high deﬁnition up to a resolution of
a few centimetres from a distance of a few kilometres. An automatic target acquisition algorithm
processes the images to identify and acquire targets based on 3D templates stored in the weapon’s
memory before the mission. Ladar sensors are usually employed on loitering systems that look at the
target from different angles, verify the target’s identity and select the best attack position for desired
results.
Figure 14.20 is a photograph of an advanced multimode ladar seeker from Lockheed Martin. The
seeker can operate as a standalone semi-active laser (SAL) and in ladar modes as well as simultaneous
SAL and ladar modes for target identiﬁcation, acquisition and tracking. The seeker is designed to
conduct a wide area search and identify actual or potential targets, including those obscured by
camouﬂage or foliage. Such ladar seekers have been successfully tested on loitering attack missile
(LAM) missions under DARPA’s NLOS-LS (non-line-of-sight launch system) and USAF’s LOCAAS
(low-cost autonomous attack system) programs. With its multimode ladar seeker, the LAM searches a
large area and relays the location of various targets back to the command centre, where these targets are
engaged by direct attack or by other assets. In case of a priority target, LAM can be commanded to break
off its search mission and attack the target.
14.3.7
Forward-looking Infrared (FLIR) Sensors
A forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor makes use of the thermal radiation emitted by the target or
scene of interest to generate its image. Essentially, it comprises a front-end optical system, a 2D array of
infrared detectors and image processing circuitry to produce output in the desired format. Infrared energy
coming from the target or scene of interest is focused by the front-end optics onto the infrared detector

Lasers and Optoelectronics

subsystem. The electrical signal produced by the detector is sent to the processing electronics, which
translates the data coming from the detector into an image. The image is displayed on a standard video
monitor or LCD screen or anywhere on a network-enabled computer.
The term ‘forward–looking’ is used here to distinguish it from imaging and tracking systems known as
‘pushbroom’ systems that look sideways in a direction perpendicular to the direction of travel of the
aerial platform they are mounted on. While a FLIR system uses a 2D detector array and is capable of
producing target image in real time, a pushbroom system usually employs a single array of detectors and
uses the motion of vehicular platform (aircraft or satellite) to generate a 2D image. Figure 14.21 shows a
comparison of the FLIR and pushbroom concepts.
FLIR systems should not be confused with night vision devices; the latter devices operate in the visible
and near-infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum extending from 0.4 mm to 1.0 mm. FLIR
systems operate in the mid-infrared (3.0–5.0 mm) and far- or long-infrared (8.0–12.0 mm) bands. These
bands allow them to detect heat sources such as heat from the engine parts of target platforms and from a
human body from a distance of the order of several kilometres. Systems operating in the 3.0–5.0 mm
band offer superior range performance as longer-distance imaging is more difﬁcult in the 8.0–12.0 mm
band due to absorption, scattering and refraction losses caused by air and water vapour. While more
sensitive long-wave FLIR need a cryogenically cooled detector array, moderately sensitive systems do
not use cryogenic cooling. Many uncooled long-wave FLIR systems are commercially available.
On the other hand, FLIR systems operating in the 3.0–5.0 mm band suffer much less attenuation due to
water vapour but generally need a more expensive detector array and cryogenic cooling. Advanced
fusion technologies are often used to blend an image produced by a visible spectrum sensor with an
infrared spectrum image to produce better results than that from a single spectrum image.
There have been different generations of FLIR sensors. Each successive generation has incorporated
not only a major change in the type of detector but also a major change in optical systems used to image
the target onto the detector. First-generation FLIRs were scanning type LWIR (long-wave infrared)
systems. The sensitivity of the ﬁrst-generation FLIR systems was limited by the background radiation,
which was overcome in second-generation FLIRs by using modiﬁed front-end optics that reduced
unwanted ﬂux. This however resulted in a ﬁxed f-number for all ﬁelds of view. Second-generation FLIR
systems operate either in MWIR (mid-wave infrared) or LWIR bands. Typically, MWIR FLIRs are
staring systems and LWIR are scanning systems. While MWIR has distinct resolution advantage over
LWIR because of its shorter wavelength, LWIR has the sensitivity advantage due to the increased
number of photons at terrestrial temperatures. Third-generation FLIRs use a dual-band detector array
and dual/variable f-number optical system.
FLIRs are used on land-based (armoured ﬁghting vehicles), naval and aerial (aircraft, helicopters,
missiles) platforms for surveillance, target acquisition and tracking applications. Some of the common
non-military applications of FLIR systems include surveillance of living things, search-and-rescue
operations during ﬁre ﬁghting, detection of gas leaks, monitoring of volcanoes and the detection of heat
in faulty electrical joints.
In military applications, FLIR imaging offers several distinct advantages. The ﬁrst advantage is its
immunity to detection by the adversary as it is a passive sensor that does not emit any radiation for
generation of an image. Secondly, it is extremely hard to camouﬂage the target from the sensor as the
FLIR senses heat. Thirdly, FLIR can see through smoke, fog, haze and other atmospheric obscurants
better than sensors operating in the visible spectrum. One of the limitations of FLIR sensors is that it is
hard for it to discriminate friend from foe. Friendly forces can use heat beacons to overcome this
problem.
Figure 14.22 is a photograph of a FLIR sensor designed for border and coastal surveillance
applications. This HRC-series FLIR (HRC-E) uses a 640  480 pixel cooled microbolometer detector
array. The sensor offers continuous zoom from 25 and 2 and a long range detection capability. The
sensor is capable of detecting a man-sized target from greater than 15 km.
State-of-the-art sensors intended for surveillance, target detection and tracking applications
employ multisensor conﬁgurations, often combining a visible spectrum sensor with an infrared
sensor. Figure 14.23 is a photograph of one such sensor that combines a thermal imaging camera with

Guided Munitions
In this section we describe different techniques of munitions guidance with particular emphasis on
electro-optically guided munitions including surface-to-air and air-to-air infrared-guided missiles and
laser-guided munitions such as aerially delivered bombs and laser-guided missiles and projectiles. The
discussion begins with a brief description of the basic guidance mechanisms in use, including both radar
guidance as well as laser guidance, which is then followed by a detailed discussion on laser-guided and
infrared-guided munitions.
14.4.1
Guidance Techniques
Different guidance techniques discussed in this section include beam rider, command, homing and
navigation guidance, which are all described in the following sections.
14.4.1.1
Beam Rider Guidance
The concept of beam riding guidance of munitions is based on a radar beam or a laser beam constantly
pointed towards the target throughout the ﬂight time of the munitions. A launching station, possibly
mounted on a vehicle, ﬁrst directs a narrow radar or laser beam at the target, which could be a tank or an
aircraft. The missile is then launched and, at some point after launch, it ﬂies into the radar or laser beam.
From this stage onwards, the missile attempts to keep itself inside the beam, while the aiming station
keeps the beam always pointed at the target. The missile, controlled by a computer inside it, ‘rides’ the
beam to the target. The missile’s guidance sensors located at the rear of the missile receive information
about the position of the missile within the beam. The missile interprets this information and generates its
own correction signals. These correction signals are used to send command signals to the control
surfaces of the weapon to keep the missile in the centre of the beam. The launch station keeps the beam
pointed at the target throughout the engagement period and the missile rides the beam to the intended
target. Both radar and laser beam rider guidance have been successfully employed for surface-to-surface,
surface-to-air and air-to-ground weapons.
Figure 14.24 illustrates the concept of beam riding for a surface-to-air weapon using a radar beam. A
laser beam could also have been used with similar performance. Figure 14.25 shows a laser beam rider
missile launched from a helicopter against a tank target. As the beam moves further away from the
launcher and towards the target, it spreads out and it becomes difﬁcult to keep the beam in the centre of
the target; this is why the beam rider concept is only effective for short to medium operational ranges.
Laser beam riding guidance became attractive for short-range anti-air and anti-tank missiles in the
1980s and 1990s with the introduction of low-cost and highly portable laser designators. In contrast to
radar beam rider guidance, a laser beam can be made much narrower than a radar beam without
increasing the size of the transmitter. Laser beam riding also allows the designer to encode additional
information in the beam using digital means. Laser beam rider missiles are inherently more accurate.
Also, the laser beam being used to guide the weapon is narrow, making it more difﬁcult to be noticed by
the target’s warning sensor. Some common examples of laser beam riders include Star Streak, the RBS-
70 and 9M119 Svir.
RBS-70 is a man portable air defence system (MANPADS) laser beam rider and is the product of
SAAB Bofors Dynamics, Sweden. RBS-70 is a laser beam rider steered by a user-operated laser beam.
The weapon is not susceptible to any deception by countermeasures employed by the target aircraft in the
form of chaff or ﬂares. Major speciﬁcations of the RBS-70 include an operational range of 0–6 km, target
engagement height of 0–5 km and a speed up to 1.6 Mach. The RBS-70 New Generation (RBS-70NG;
Figure 14.26) includes an improved sighting system capable of night vision. RBS-70 Mk-2 upgrade is
called Bolide missile. It is faster with a speed of 2 Mach and has a range of 8 km.

14.4.1.2
Command Guidance
In the case of command guidance, the missile is commanded on an intercept course with the target.
Conventionally, this is achieved by using two separate radars to continuously track the target and the
missile. Tracking data from these radars is fed to a computer that computes the trajectories of the
two vehicles. The computer in turn sends appropriate command signals over a radio link to the missile.

A sensor onboard the missile decodes the commands and operates the control surfaces of the missile to
adjust its course in order to intercept the target in ﬂight. Figure 14.27a shows the block schematic
representation of command guidance and Figure 14.27b depicts the deployment scenario.
Wire-guided missiles are an example of command guidance. Command signals are sent to the missile
through a conventional wire or a ﬁbre-optic cable that actually reels out from the rear of the missile up to
the launch platform. The missile trajectory in this case is controlled with the help of command signals
transmitted via a wired link rather than a radio link. Wire-guided missiles are commonly used for short-
range anti-tank operations launched from either land-based platforms or helicopters. In many cases, even
torpedoes ﬁred from submarines use wire guidance. TOW is a popular example of a wire-guided missile.
Manufactured by Hughes Aircraft Company, it is primarily used in anti-tank warfare and is a command
to line-of-sight weapon. Current versions are capable of penetrating 75 cm of armour at a maximum
range of greater than 3 km. It can be ﬁred from a vehicular platform, a helicopter or by infantrymen using
a tripod stand. Images of a TOW missile system are provided by Figure 14.28.

Command guidance can be classiﬁed as command line-of-sight (CLOS) and command off line-of-
sight (COLOS) guidance. CLOS systems are further subdivided into four groups: (1) manual command
to line-of-sight (MCLOS) where target tracking, missile tracking and control functions are all performed
manually; (2) semi-manual command to line-of-sight (SMCLOS) where target tracking is automatic
but missile tracking and control functions are performed manually; (3) semi-automatic command to
line-of-sight (SACLOS), where the target tracking is manual and the missile tracking and control
functions are automatic; and (4) automatic command to line-of-sight (ACLOS) where all three functions
are automatic.
SACLOS is the most common form of guidance in use against ground targets such as bunkers and
tanks. Hellﬁre from Lockheed Martin is helicopter-launched ﬁre-and-forget anti-armour air-to-ground
weapon of the SACLOS category. Generations (1)–(3) of the weapon use a laser seeker while generation
(4) uses radar seeker. Figure 14.29 is a photograph of a Hellﬁre missile.
Unlike the CLOS system, the COLOS system does not depend on angular coordinates of the
missile and the target. The guidance system ensures missile interception of the target by locating
both the missile and target in space for which the distance coordinate is needed. This is only possible if
both missile tracker and target tracker are active. It may also be mentioned here that in the case of the
COLOS system, the missile and target tracker can be oriented in different directions.
14.4.1.3
Homing Guidance
Homing guidance is the most common form of guidance methodology used in surface-to-air- and
air-to-air-guided weapons. Homing guidance is further subdivided into four groups: semi-active
homing, active homing, passive homing and track-via-missile homing, also known as retransmission
homing.
Figure 14.29

536
Lasers and Optoelectronics

In the case of semi-active homing guidance, the target is illuminated by an external source which
could be radar or laser. The electromagnetic energy reﬂected by the target is intercepted by the seeker
head of the guided weapon. An onboard-computer processes the intercepted signal and determines
the target’s relative trajectory. It sends appropriate command signals to the control surfaces of the
weapon to make it intercept the target. Figure 14.30 illustrates the concept of semi-active homing
guidance in the case of an air-to-air missile. Semi-active homing is similar to command guidance
except for the fact that, in the case of former, the command computer is onboard the weapon. The
type of seeker head, whether it is a radar seeker or a laser seeker, depends on the type of external
source designating the target. Both radar- as well as laser-guided semi-active homing weapons are in
use. The Sparrow air-to-air missile and laser-guided weapons of the Paveway series are examples of
semi-active homing guidance. Laser-guided munitions and infrared-guided missiles are described in
detail in Sections 14.4.2.1 and 14.4.2.2, respectively.
In the case of active homing guidance, the source of target designation is also onboard the
weapon with the result that this methodology does not require an external source. These features put
it in the category of ﬁre-and-forget missiles as the launch platform does not need to continue to
illuminate the target after the missile has been launched. Active homing guidance weapons are
usually radar guided. Also, in the case of active homing guidance, the transmitted and reﬂected
waves are at the same angle with respect to the line-of-sight between the target and the missile. This
is different from semi-active homing mechanism in which transmitted and reﬂected waves are at an
angle. Fir this reason, semi-active and active homing guidance systems are sometimes called
bistatic and monostatic systems, respectively. The RBS-15 anti-ship missile from Saab Bofors
Dynamics, MBDA Exocet anti-ship and MBDA MICA (Figure 14.31) surface-to-air and air-to-air
missiles from MBDA, AS-34 Kormoran anti-ship missile from EADS and Indian DRDO-Astra

BVRAAM air-to-air missile are some examples of missiles that use active radar homing in the
terminal phase.
Passive homing guidance makes use of some form of energy emitted by the target. This energy is
intercepted by the missile seeker, which is processed to extract guidance information to guide the missile
to the target. This energy could be in the form of heat energy generated by the target, which is made use
of by the seeker in an infrared-guided missile. Infrared-guided missiles constitute an important category
of electro-optically guided precision strike weapons, and are discussed in detail in Section 14.4.2.2. Anti-
radiation missiles such as AGM-88 HARM air-to-ground missiles track the radio frequency energy
emitted by the ground-based radar stations to generate guidance signals. Passive torpedoes make use of
sound waves generated by engines of the ships or sonars to attack their targets. Missiles such as the
AGM-65 Maverick are equipped with electro-optic sensors that rely on visual images to guide the
weapon to the target.
In the case of retransmission homing guidance, the target is illuminated by an external radar. The
energy reﬂected by the target is intercepted by the missile sensor. In this case, the missile does not have
an onboard computer to process the sensor signal and generate guidance command. Instead, the sensor
signal is transmitted back to the launch platform for processing. The command signals generated at the
launch platform are retransmitted back to the missile for use by the missile’s control surfaces to guide the
missile to the target. The advantage with this guidance technique, also called ‘track-via-missile’, is that
the expensive tracking and processing hardware is not destroyed along with the missile. The dis-
advantage is that it requires a high-speed communication link between the missile and the launch station.
MIM-104 Patriot surface-to-air missile system of Raytheon Company, USA is an example of a track-via-
missile homing guidance system (Figure 14.32).
14.4.1.4
Navigation Guidance
The term guidance not only refers to the determination of the desired path of travel, also called the
trajectory from the vehicle’s current location to a intended target, but also refers to the desired
changes in velocity, rotation and acceleration required to follow the desired path. The term navigation
refers to the determination, at a given time, of the vehicle’s present state vector deﬁned by location
and velocity and also its attitude. The term control refers to the manipulation of the forces, by way of
steering controls and thrusters, needed to track guidance commands while maintaining vehicle

stability. It is the combination of these three functions that comprises navigation guidance.
Navigation guidance can also be classiﬁed as inertial navigation, ranging navigation, celestial
navigation and geophysical navigation.
In the case of inertial navigation guidance, the vehicle uses onboard sensors to determine its motion
and acceleration with the help of gyroscopes and accelerometers. The gyroscope is used to measure
angular rotation and an accelerometer is used to measure the linear motion. The gyroscope and
accelerometer are combined into a single unit along with a control mechanism, referred to as an
inertial measurement unit (IMU) or inertial navigation sensor (INS). An INS system basically works
by telling the vehicle where it is at the time of launch and the vehicle’s computer uses the signals from
the IMU to ensure that the vehicle travels along the programmed path. INSs are widely used on a
range of aerospace vehicles including commercial airliners, military aircraft, missiles and spacecraft.
The long-range all-weather subsonic cruise missile Tomahawk and medium-range all-weather beyond
visual range air-to-air missile AMRAAM are examples that use inertial navigation for mid-course
guidance.
While inertial navigation guidance technique makes use of onboard sensors, ranging navigation
depends on external signals for guidance, which are usually provided by radio beacons. Based on
the direction and strength of the signals received by the aircraft, it navigates its way along the
desired trajectory. Ranging navigation guidance has been largely rendered obsolete with the arrival
of the global positioning system (GPS). GPS-based navigation has largely replaced radio beacons
in both military and civilian applications. GPS is a key enabling technology for existing and future
military precision navigation applications. The joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs) series of
guided bombs makes use of integrated INS and GPS guidance techniques to determine where they
are with respect to the locations of their targets. An INS–GPS combination gives the precision-
guided weapon a kind of all-weather capability and largely overcomes the vulnerability to adverse
ground and weather conditions of weapons employing laser and imaging infrared seekers. In fact,
state-of-the-art precision strike weapons use a combination of guidance technologies including
inertial navigation, global position sensing and laser/infrared seeking to achieve higher perform-
ance levels.
Celestial navigation, one of the oldest navigation techniques, uses the positions of the stars to
determine location, especially latitude, on the surface of the Earth. This form of navigation guidance
requires good visibility of the stars, which makes it particularly useful at night or at very high altitudes.

In celestial navigation, the missile compares the positions of the stars to an image stored in its memory to
determine its ﬂight path. Submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) Poseidon of Lockheed Martin,
carrying multiple independent re-entry technology and with an operational range in excess of 4500 km, is
an example of a ballistic missile using celestial navigation.
Geophysical navigation guidance depends on measurements made on the surface of the Earth for
operation. It uses compasses and magnetometers to measure the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld as well as
gravitometers to measure the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. This technique has not found much application
in missile guidance.
Another guidance technique makes use of terrain contour matching. It uses a radar altimeter to
measure height above the ground. By comparing the contours of the terrain against data stored onboard
the missile, the missile’s autopilot navigates its way to the destined location. Terrain contour matching
(TERCOM) is a navigation system used primarily by cruise missiles.
A related technique to terrain matching is digital scene matching. It is far more accurate than the
terrain matching technique. For guidance, this technique compares the image seen below the weapon to
satellite or aerial images stored in the missile computer. If the scenes do not match, the computer sends
commands to control surfaces to adjust the missile’s course until the images match to a certain
acceptable level. The Tomahawk guidance systems use a combination of INS, GPS, TERCOM and
digital scene matching techniques.
14.4.1.5
Ring Laser Gyroscope
A ring laser gyroscope (RLG) is an important optronic rate sensor and is at the heart of any inertial
navigation system. There are different types of gyroscopic sensors such as spinning wheel mechanical
gyro, dynamically tuned gyro, ring laser gyro and ﬁbre-optic gyro. An RLG offers superior performance
compared to a conventional spinning type mechanical gyro, as there are no moving parts and therefore no
inherent drift terms due to absence of friction. Unlike a mechanical gyro, the RLG does not resist changes
to its orientation. A combination of three orthogonally placed RLGs provides a rate sensor with three
degrees of freedom.
Having only brieﬂy described different types of guidance techniques in Sections 14.4.1.1–14.4.1.4, we
discuss in detail the operational principle, salient features and performance parameters of a ring laser
gyroscope in this section.
A ring laser gyroscope is primarily a rate sensor, which can be used to measure rotation by integrating
the rate information. It essentially consists of two counter-propagating laser beams over the same path. It
operates on the principle of the Sagnac effect, according to which the null points of the internal standing
wave pattern produced by the counter-propagating laser modes shift in response to angular rotation. The
shift in the nulls of the standing wave pattern manifests itself in the form of a moving interference
pattern, observed by combining the two laser modes.
The basic concept of a ring laser gyroscope can be explained as follows. The frequency of
oscillation in a linear laser is such that that the laser cavity consists of an integral number of
wavelengths. Linear laser cavity is constituted by the double pass of the distance between the two
mirrors. Since it is imperative that the beam replicates itself for successive passes over the cavity
length, there will always be nodes at the two mirrors and the two oppositely propagating laser
beams comprise a standing wave. In the case of a ring laser, the two oppositely directed laser
beams can be considered as travelling waves and there is no such constraint of having a node at
the mirror. The two beams in this case can be independent of each other and oscillate at a different
amplitude and frequency. The oscillation frequency of each is determined by the optical path
length (not the geometrical path length).Any mechanism that produces an optical path difference – rotation
in this case – results in different frequencies of oscillation for the two laser beams. If the rotation is in the
clockwise direction, the clockwise laser beam will see a larger optical path length than that encountered by
the anticlockwise beam.Forrotation in the anticlockwise direction, it wouldbe the opposite. The frequency
difference is proportional to the rotation rate of the cavity.
540
Lasers and Optoelectronics

By measuring the frequency difference, the rotation rate of the cavity and the platform it is strapped
onto can be measured. According to the Sagnac equation, the frequency difference Dn is given by
Equation 14.7:
Dn ¼ 4AV
lP
(14.7)
where
A ¼ encircled oriented surface area of the ring laser
P ¼ perimeter
l ¼ wavelength
V ¼ rotation rate
Figure 14.33a depicts square ring laser geometry, which is one form of geometry in use. In the case
of square ring laser geometry, four mirrors form a closed light path. A small part of the ring laser path
houses the excited gain medium. The gain medium along with mirrors is responsible for producing the
two counter-propagating laser beams. The difference frequency produced as result of rotation is
obtained by interference of the two beams. The two beams are usually combined with the help of a
corner prism as shown in the diagram. Figure 14.33b highlights the constructional features of the
square type ring laser geometry. Another commonly used ring laser cavity structure is triangular
geometry, as shown in Figure 14.34. This type of geometry is popular with ring laser gyroscopes from
Honeywell.
As is evident from the Sagnac equation, constancy of A and P is very important to achieve the kind of
angular resolution capable of present-day ring laser gyroscopes. It is due to this reason that a ring laser
cavity block is made from material of an exceptionally high thermal stability. ZERODUR, the registered
trade name of a near-zero thermal expansion transparent glass ceramic made by Schott, Germany, is one
such material. The material has a thermal expansion coefﬁcient of 107 C1 over a temperature range
0–50 C.
RLGs suffer from an effect referred to as lock-in at very low rotation rates. When the rotation rate is
very low, the frequencies of the counter-propagating laser beams become almost identical, which leads to
the two beams being injection-locked to a common frequency. As a result of this, it does not respond to

541

rotation. This is illustrated in the transfer characteristics of Figure 14.35. This problem is largely
overcome by using forced dithering in which the ring laser cavity is rotated clockwise and anticlockwise
about its axis using a mechanical spring driven at its resonance frequency. Typically, a peak dither rate of
1 Arcsec/sec is used and dither frequency is in the range of 400–500 Hz.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

Important parameters that describe the performance of a ring laser gyroscope include bias error, drift
and instability, scale factor stability and angular random walk. Bias error is the output produced by the
gyroscope when it is not experiencing any rotation. Bias error is deﬁned as the voltage or percentage of
full-scale output representative of the rotational velocity in  s1 as measured by the gyroscope in the
absence of any rotation. The bias error is primarily caused by a number of factors including calibration
errors, bias drift, bias variation with temperature and effect of shock or ‘g’ level.
Bias drift refers to the variation of bias error over time, assuming all other factors remain constant.
This is a warm-up effect usually caused by self heating of electrical and mechanical components of the
gyroscope. This effect is more prevalent only during the warm-up time of ﬁrst few seconds and is non-
existent after that. It should not be confused with the more colloquial term drift rate.
Bias instability is the fundamental parameter that deﬁnes how good or bad the gyroscope is. It is
deﬁned as the minimum point on the Allan Variance curve measured in deg h1. (The Allan Variance
technique is a very powerful mathematical method which allows a user to assess the real performance of
any gyroscope in relation to the dynamics of the application, taking into account the effects of bias, noise,
drift and long-term sensor instability.) It represents the best bias stability achievable in a given gyroscope
with bias averaging taken at the interval deﬁned by the Allan Variance minimum. As an example, bias
stability error in the case of a Honeywell gyroscope type GG 1320 is speciﬁed to be  0.002 deg h1.
Bias instability is always measured by averaging successive data samples. The challenge lies in
selecting a suitable time over which to average sampled data. Averages taken over short time intervals
will be dominated by noise while those over a longer period are dominated by longer-term drift. The
technique involves selecting a range of time intervals, typically 0.01–500 s, over which to average data.
The standard deviation thus obtained from one averaged time period to the next is calculated and plotted
against the averaging interval in log-log form. The resulting graph has a characteristic ‘bathtub’ shape. It
is possible to compute the key deﬁning characteristics of the gyroscope, namely angular random walk,
bias instability and rate random walk, from this graph.
Scale factor and scale factor stability represent the transfer or output versus input characteristics of
the gyroscope. It measures the signal produced in terms of voltage or bits for a given rotation rate. It is a
measure of the slope of the best straight line through the points on a graph representing the gyroscope
output against input rotation rate measured over the speciﬁed dynamic range of the gyroscope. As an
example, for an analogue gyroscope it is measured in V deg1 s. Scale factor stability ﬁgure for a
Honeywell gyroscope type GG 1320 is stated to be 10 ppm and maximum rate measuring capability of
500 deg s1.
Angular random walk (ARW) is a measure of gyroscope noise and is measured in deg h0.5 or
deg s0.5. It can be thought of as the standard deviation due to noise while integrating the output of a
stationary gyroscope over a period of time. It is inversely proportional to the square-root of integration
Figure 14.35
Lock-in effect in RLG.

543

time. As an illustration, if a gyroscope had an ARW of 1 deg s0.5, then the result of angular position
measurement in the ideal case would be zero. The longer the integration time, the larger the spread of the
results from zero. The spread will follow the law of being inversely proportional to the square-root of
integration time. In the case of a Honeywell gyroscope (and this is also true for typical inertial grade
gyroscopes), the random walk noise is speciﬁed to be 0.0018 deg h0.5.
As outlined at the beginning of this section, the INS would have three orthogonally placed RLGs to
provide measurement capability of rotation in three degrees of freedom. Along with accelerometers, the
RLGs constitute the INS. Figure 14.36 shows one such RLG-based INS package. The system is a high-
grade inertial measurement unit that meets the accuracy requirements of attitude, orientation, position
and navigation. The system is characterized by a bias stability of 0.1 deg h1, scale factor stability of
75 ppm and angular random walk speciﬁcation of 0.028 deg h0.5.
Example 14.4
A ring laser gyroscope uses a He-Ne ring laser operating at 0.633 mm. The ring laser employs an
equilateral triangular laser cavity with each arm equal to 10 cm. Determine the beat frequency for a

Solution
 According to the fundamental ring laser gyroscope equation, Dn ¼ 4AV

 P ¼ 10  3 ¼ 30 cm
 l ¼ 0.633 mm ¼ 0.633  104 cm
 A ¼ p3  102/4 ¼ 173.2/4 ¼ 43.3 cm2
 Therefore, Dn (in Hz) ¼ (4  43.3/0.633  104  30)  V (in deg s1) ¼ 25.33  V (in deg h1).
 For V ¼ 0.1 deg h1, Dn ¼ 25.33  0.1 ¼ 2.533 Hz.

Example 14.5
Determine the percentage improvement in scale factor of two triangular ring laser gyroscopes with
optical path lengths of 30 cm (each arm of the ring laser having a path length of 10 cm) and 45 cm (each
arm of ring laser having an optical path length of 15 cm), assuming other parameters to be identical.
Solution
 Scale factor is proportional to the ratio of the area encircled by the optical path length to the optical
path length. Assuming other parameters to be the same, this ratio is proportional to p3/12  L where
L is the optical path length.
 Therefore, improvement in scale factor ¼ L2/L1 ¼ 45/30 ¼ 1.5
 That is, a scale factor of a 45 cm gyroscope is 1.5 times that of a 30 cm gyroscope.
 Percentage improvement is therefore 50%.
14.4.1.6
Fibre-optic Gyroscope
Unlike aclassicalmechanicalgyroscope,whichisbasedonthe principle ofconservation ofmomentum,but
very much like the ring laser gyroscope described in Section 14.4.1.5, a ﬁbre-optic gyroscope (FOG) has
virtually no moving parts and no inertial resistance to movement. The operational principle of a ﬁbre-optic
gyroscope is also based on the Sagnac effect. It consists of a long coil of optical ﬁbre, typically a few
kilometres in length, and makes use of the interference of light to detect mechanical rotation. FOGprovides
extremelypreciserotationalrateinformationduetoitslackofcross-axissensitivitytovibration,acceleration
and shock. Furthermore, it does not require any starting calibration and it consumes relatively little power.
Fibre-optic gyroscopes can be very compact, as optical ﬁbre lengths as long as a few kilometres can be
wrappedaroundasmall-diametercoil.Thedevelopmentofﬁbre-opticgyroscopesreceivedalargeboostand

single-mode optical ﬁbre, mainly triggered by the demands of the telecommunications industry.
Figure 14.37 depicts a ﬁbre-optic gyroscope. Two split laser beams from a single laser are injected into
the same ﬁbre but in opposite directions. Due to the Sagnac effect, the beam travelling against the rotation
experiences a slightly shorter path length delay than the other beam. The resulting differential phase shift
is measured through interferometry, translating one component of the angular velocity into a shift of the
interference pattern which is measured photometrically. Beam-splitting optics launches light from a laser
diode into two waves propagating in the clockwise and anticlockwise directions through a coil consisting
of many turns of optical ﬁbre. The strength of the interference signal depends on the effective area of the
closed optical path according to the Sagnac effect. This is not simply the geometric area of the loop, but is
enhanced by the number of turns in the coil. The FOG was ﬁrst proposed by Vali and Shorthill in 1976.
Development of both the passive interferometer type of FOG (IFOG) and a newer concept, the passive
ring resonator FOG (RFOG), is proceeding in many companies and establishments worldwide.
A ﬁbre-optic gyroscope is perhaps the most reliable alternative to the mechanical gyroscope. Because
of their intrinsic reliability, ﬁbre-optic gyroscopes are used for high-performance space applications.
Compared to a ring laser gyroscope, it typically offers a higher resolution but has relatively poorer drift
and scale factor performance speciﬁcations. Typically, its sensitivity ﬁgure of 0.1 deg h1 it nowhere
near the demonstrated RLG sensitivity of better than 0.001 deg h1. Unlike ring laser gyroscopes where
zero beat frequency always means zero angular velocity, for a ﬁbre-optic gyroscope the indication which
corresponds to zero angular velocity needs to be determined.
The success of the ﬁbre-optic gyroscope lies in its desirable features such as lightweight, small size,
limited power consumption, projected long lifetime and low cost. This makes ﬁbre-optic gyroscopes
particularly attractive in applications such as automotive construction and robotics, which call for less-
demanding performance levels in terms of sensitivity and drift speciﬁcations and where small size and
low cost are important considerations.
Fibre-optic gyroscopes are used in a wide variety of applications, including inertial navigation,
navigation of remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV),

Electro-optically Guided Precision Strike Munitions
This section provides an overview of electro-optically guided precision strike munitions, which includes
laser-guided munitions and infrared-guided missiles, in terms of their operational basics, important
performance parameters and need for periodic testing of operationally vital parameters. This is followed
by a detailed discussion on laser-guided munitions.
Due to their precision strike capability, laser-guided munitions (bombs, projectiles and missiles) and
IR-guided surface-to-air and air-to-air missiles are the most widely exploited electro-optically precision
strike munitions on various land- and sea-based and airborne military platforms such as main battle
tanks, armoured ﬁghting vehicles, ships, ﬁghter aircraft and attack helicopters. This class of guided
weapons has proved their lethality and efﬁcacy beyond any doubt during recent conﬂicts. These
sophisticated weapons have huge price tags attached to them and are also of great tactical importance in
the contemporary battleﬁeld scenario.
All electro-optically guided precision strike munitions use a type of optoelectronic position sensor
subsystem known as a seeker unit that determines the position of the weapon with respect to the target in

real time and feeds this information to a servo control subsystem. The servo control subsystem ensures
that the weapon maintains its orientation in the desired direction of the target in order to ultimately
hit it precisely. There are two broad categories of electro-optically guided precision strike munitions:
laser-guided munitions and IR-guided missiles. Figure 14.39a and b show the constructional features of
laser-guided and infrared-guided munitions, respectively. This classiﬁcation is based on the type of

seeker unit and the associated principle of operation involved in the functioning of the two types. The
seeker units used in the two types of guided munitions are known as laser seekers and IR seekers,
respectively. IR seekers can be further classiﬁed into non-imaging and imaging.
14.4.2.1
Laser-guided Munitions: Operational Basics
In laser-guided munitions delivery operations, the target is illuminated (target designation) by a pulsed
solid-state laser producing high peak power pulses with a known PRF. Peak power, pulse width and PRF
are typically in the range 5–8 MW, 10–20 ns and 5–20 Hz respectively. The laser seeker head in the
weapon makes use of laser radiation scattered from the target to generate information on the angular
error, which in turn is used to generate command signals needed to guide the weapon to the source of
scatter, which is the target (Figure 14.40).
Before the weapon locks on to the radiation scattered from the target, it ensures that the radiation is the
intended one. The laser target designator and the laser seeker used in the guided weapon delivery mission
use the same PRF code; the PRF code compatibility check forms the basis of identiﬁcation of the desired
radiation and is therefore essential to the function and mission success of the weapon. The PRF code is
generally chosen to an accuracy of 1 to 2 ms in the time interval between two successive laser pulses
in a nominal value that is usually in the range of 50–200 ms. The seeker head front-end uses a type of
optoelectronic position sensor that determines the orientation of the weapon with respect to the target.
Before it does that however, it deciphers the PRF of the received radiation; it is only processed further to
extract information on the angular position of the weapon with respect to the target if the PRF matches
the chosen PRF value within a speciﬁed tolerance.

There are various possible laser-guided munitions deployment scenarios. The scenario illustrated in
Figure 14.40 uses a ground-based laser target designator and aerially delivered bomb. Other possible
scenarios include the case where the laser target designator is located on a different aircraft from that
carrying the laser-guided bomb; such a deployment scenario is depicted in Figure 14.41. Alternatively,
the target may be designated from a ground-based designator and the guided munitions are launched
from a ground-based platform (e.g. cannon-launched laser-guided projectiles); this is depicted in
Figure 14.42. Finally, both the laser target designation and laser-guided munitions delivery can be
executed from the same airborne platform as shown in Figure 14.43.
The optoelectronic sensor employed for the purpose is usually a quadrant photosensor. A 2D array of
photosensors is also used in some cases. Figure 14.44 describes the principle of operation of a quadrant
photosensor when used for a position-sensing application. The quadrant photosensor is placed before the
focal plane of the front-end optics. The focal spot is symmetrical about the centre of the quadrant

tions delivery from ground-based platforms.

photosensor when the perpendicular-to-focal plane of the detector is collinear with the axis of the
received laser radiation scattered from the intended target, as shown in Figure 14.45a . This is the case
when the weapon is pointing precisely towards the target. If the laser radiation is impinging on the laser
seeker cross-section at an angle, which will be the case when the weapon is not pointing towards the
intended target, the centre of the focused laser spot will shift, depending upon angular error in azimuth
and elevation as shown in Figure 14.45b–e.

tions delivery from the same airborne platform.

The beam position in the x- and y- directions are calculated using Equations 14.6 and 14.7
respectively, where X and Y represent the angular errors in the azimuth and elevation directions:

where A, B, C and D are the electrical voltages corresponding to laser power falling on the four
quadrants.

552
Lasers and Optoelectronics

In the case of precisely pointing towards the target, all four power levels are equal and therefore X ¼ 0
and Y ¼ 0. The sum A þ B þ C þ D represents total power; division by total power ensures that the
calculated position error is independent of laser intensity variations.
The output analogue signals proportional to the magnitude of laser power falling on the four quadrants
are digitized and then processed to compute X and Y. Error signals X and Y are then used to guide the
weapon towards the desired position of null with the canards driven by a servo control system. The
maximum value of proportional ﬁeld of view offered by the laser seeker of this type in the x- and
y-directions is proportional to R, where R is the radius of the focused laser spot. A larger spot size gives
a larger ﬁeld-of-view but a lower angular resolution. The radius of the focused spot can at the most be
equal to half of the radius of the quadrant active area.
In the case of a 2D-array-based sensor, each active element in the array is identiﬁed by a unique
azimuth and elevation angle. The focused spot at any time covers more than one active element and the
angular error in azimuth and elevation is computed from Equations 14.10 and 14.11. Figure 14.46
explains the concept.

where u is the proportional ﬁeld-of-view of each miniature quadrant and n and m are constants depending
upon the illuminating quadrant.
The major parameters of interest of laser-guided munitions include: (1) sensitivity; (2) ﬁeld-of-view;
(3) PRF code compatibility; and (4) response linearity. In addition to these, immunity to false codes and
response to desired code in the presence of false code are also important in assessing the performance
efﬁcacy of laser-guided munitions.
Sensitivity is the minimum value of laser power density impinging on the seeker cross-section in a
plane orthogonal to the optical axis of the seeker head to which it can respond satisfactorily. It is a
characteristic of the seeker front-end optics and photosensor. The sensitivity of the seeker determines the

553

maximum guidance range for known values of laser target designator parameters, target reﬂectivity,
height of laser target designator (in the case of airborne laser designator) and laser seeker above sea
surface and visibility condition.
Field-of-view determines the probability of the weapon ﬁnding itself within the laser basket at the
maximum guidance range. Laser-guided munitions using a seeker head with a larger ﬁeld-of-view would
have a higher probability of ﬁnding themselves in the laser basket and subsequently hit the intended
target.
PRF code compatibility is the primary requirement for the weapon to function and refers to the PRF
code of the received laser radiation matching (within a certain tolerance) the PRF code programmed in
the guidance unit before the start of mission. It is usually expressed as the time interval between two
successive laser pulses in milliseconds up to a third decimal place. The two codes are considered
compatible if the difference in time periods of the two codes is less than a certain speciﬁed value.
Response linearity predominantly determines the circular error probability (CEP).
Immunity to false PRF codes and the capability to stay locked to the desired code in the presence of
false PRF codes enhances the probability of a target hit. The former test is performed by irradiating the
seeker head with a PRF code different from the programmed PRF code, and the latter by irradiating the
seeker head simultaneously with radiations of correct and false PRF codes.
14.4.2.2
IR-guided Missiles: Operational Basics
IR-guided missiles are of two types: those employing non-imaging and imaging seeker heads. The
majority of the present-day surface-to-air and air-to-air IR-guided missiles are of the non-imaging type.
Non-imaging IR-guided missiles make use of the IR emission corresponding to the thermal signatures of
the exhaust and the mainframe of the target aircraft to home on it. Emission in the 3–5 mm and 8–12 mm
bands is characteristic of the electromagnetic emission from a jet exhaust and mainframe of the aircraft.
Figure 14.47 depicts the spectral proﬁle of IR emission from a typical target aircraft. The spectral content
of IR emission as received by the IR seeker head is the superposition of the spectral emission of the
aircraft on the transmission characteristics of the atmosphere (Figure 14.48) . Figure 14.49 shows a
Figure 14.47

typical IR spectrum that would be seen by the IR seeker head. This wavelength signature is judiciously
used in the guidance of air-to-air and surface-to-air IR-guided missiles.
The IR-guided missiles developed in the 1970s and 1980s used single-colour IR seekers employing
the 3–5 mm band. The MAGIC series of IR-guided air-to-air missiles from France and R-73 series of
IR-guided air-to-air missiles from Russia are examples. State-of-the-art IR-guided missiles use two-
colour seekers that employ both the 3–5 mm and 8–12 mm bands to offer improved false alarm rejection
and immunity to deception by ﬂares. The Python from Israel and RVVAE from Russia are examples of
Figure 14.48
Transmission characteristics of atmosphere.

IR-guided missiles using two-colour seeker heads. Another emerging trend is the use of imaging IR
seekers even in surface-to-air and air-to-air IR-guided missiles, although their use is primarily in short-
range anti-tank IR-guided missiles.
Both surface-to-air and air-to-air IR-guided missiles receive the IR signatures of the target in the
presence of background radiation from the sky and the IR signatures of ﬂares, if any, deployed by
the target aircraft platform. The seeker head should be able to discriminate between the IR signatures of
the background and ﬂares from those of the target.
Important parameters of IR-guided missiles include spectral matching of received IR signatures with
those of the target as known to the seeker, the response of the seeker head to target signatures in the
presence of static IR background noise, immunity to deception by ﬂares and ﬁeld-of-view.
14.5
Laser Communication
Communication technology has experienced continual development to higher and higher carrier
frequencies, starting from a few hundred kilohertz during the time of Marconi to several hundred
terahertz since lasers were employed in ﬁbre systems. The main driving force was that the usable
bandwidth and the consequently the transmission capacity increased in direct proportion to the carrier
frequency. Another asset comes into play in free-space point-to-point links. The minimum divergence
obtainable with a freely propagating beam of electromagnetic waves is proportional to the wavelength.
The jump from microwaves to light waves therefore means a reduction in beam width by orders of
magnitude, even if we used transmit antennas of a much smaller diameter. The reduced beam width not
only implies increased intensity at the receiver site but also reduced crosstalk between closely operating
links and less chance for eavesdropping.
Space communication, as employed in satellite-to-satellite links, is traditionally performed using
microwaves. For more than 25 years however, laser systems have been investigated as an alternative. It is
hoped that mass, power consumption and size of an optical transceiver module will be smaller than that
of a microwave transceiver. Fuel consumption for satellite attitude control when quickly re-directing
antennas should also be less for optical antennas. On the other hand, a new set of problems would need to
be addressed in connection with the extreme requirements for pointing, acquiring and tracking the
narrow-width laser beams.
14.5.1
Advantages and Limitations
Optical communication is a technology that uses light propagating in the communication medium to
transmit data for telecommunications or computer networking. The communication media can be free
space (which means air), outer space, vacuum, water or an optical transmission line such as optical
ﬁbre cable.
The key advantages of using optical communications, whether ﬁbre optic, free space or underwater,
include high achievable data transmission rates, low bit error rates, immunity to electromagnetic
interference, full duplex operation, higher communication security and no necessity for the Fresnel zone.
The light beam can also be very narrow, making it hard to intercept.
Key disadvantages include beam dispersion, particularly in free-space and underwater communication
applications, signal attenuation due to atmospheric absorption and adverse weather conditions and
scintillation and signal swamping when the sun goes exactly behind the transmitter. These factors cause
an attenuated receiver signal and lead to higher bit error ratio (BER). To overcome these issues, designers
have found some solutions such as multibeam or multipath architectures, which use more than one
sender and more than one receiver. Some state-of-the-art devices also have a larger fade margin (extra
power, reserved for rain, smog and fog). To keep an eye-safe environment, good free-space optical
communication systems have a limited laser power density and support laser classes 1 or 1 M.
Attenuation due to atmospheric conditions, which are exponential in nature, limits the practical range
of free-space optical (FSO) communication devices to several kilometres. In the following sections we
describe free-space and ﬁbre-optic communication.
556
Lasers and Optoelectronics

14.5.2
Free-space Communication
Free-space optical communication is an optical communication technology that makes use of light as the
carrier to transmit intelligence. Free space here means air, outer space, vacuum or something similar. The
technology is useful where physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considera-
tions. The other advantages of optical communication, outlined in the previous paragraph, are all
relevant. Figure 14.50 shows the basic block schematic arrangement of a free-space optical communi-
cation link.
Practical free-space point-to-point optical links are usually implemented by using infrared laser light,
although low-data-rate communication over short distances is possible using LEDs. The maximum range
for terrestrial links is of the order 2–3 km, but the stability and quality of the link is highly dependent on
atmospheric factors such as rain, fog, dust and heat. Data transmission rates approaching 1 Gbps have
been demonstrated in the case of free-space optical communication, but not for terrestrial links.
Preferred wavelengths for free-space optical communication are 850 nm and 1550 nm. Operation in
the 3–5 mm and 8–14 mm bands have also been used due to the excellent atmospheric transmission
characteristics in these bands. The selection of optimum wavelength for free-space communication
depends upon many factors which include required transmission distance, eye safety considerations,
availability of components and cost. Recent studies have revealed that operation in the 3–5 mm and
8–14 mm bands does not offer a signiﬁcant advantage compared to the 850 nm and 1550 nm bands to
counteract the scattering losses. The availability of sources and detectors is also limited in the mid-
infrared and far-infrared bands. Another advantage with 1550 nm comes along with its eye safety feature.
Regulatory agencies allow approximately 100 times higher laser power level for 1550 nm compared to
850 nm. In general, the choice of a speciﬁc wavelength is not so important as long as it is not strongly
absorbed in the atmosphere.
In outer space, the communication range of free-space optical communication is currently of the order
of several thousand kilometres. This can be extended to cover interplanetary distances of millions of
kilometres, using optical telescopes as beam expanders. The use of optical communication technology

involving detection and emission of laser light by space probes has been investigated several times in the
past. A two-way distance record for communication was set by the Mercury laser altimeter instrument
aboard the Messenger (Mercury surface, space environment, geochemistry and ranging) spacecraft. This
infrared diode-pumped neodymium laser, designed as a laser altimeter for a Mercury orbit mission and
known as the Mercury laser altimeter (MLA), set a record of two-way communication across a distance
of 24 million km (i.e. 24 Gm) as the craft neared Earth on a ﬂy-by in May 2005.
The space-based free-space optical communication concept has been around for many years and
signiﬁcant advances have recently been made for the concept to fructify in both civilian and government-
funded non-classiﬁed and classiﬁed applications. The primary market of free-space optical communi-
cation today is that of inter-satellite links (ISLs). There is scope for providing a space–Earth optical
communication link despite the discouraging atmosphere-related issues. For example, research to
develop a satellite–submarine optical communication link has been funded, which mainly interests
military strategists. In such a link, the problems encountered are not only from atmospheric issues but
also from the propagation of the laser through a turbulent ocean.
Returning to the primary application of free-space optical communication links in today’s world, that
is, inter-satellite links, it may be mentioned here that inter-satellite communications is mainly used for
networking of a satellite constellation. The involved data rates could vary from hundreds of megabits per
seconds to several gigabits per second. These inter-satellite links are in use for all types of satellite orbits
including low Earth orbits (LEOs), medium Earth orbits (MEOs), geosynchronous Earth orbits (GEOs)
and even highly elliptical orbits (HEOs). Although there are satellite constellations currently operational
that employ RF inter-satellite links, examples being the Iridium satellite system and NASA’s TDRSS
(tracking and data relay satellite system), the future deﬁnitely belongs to optical ISLs. This is supported
by the fact that most of the commercial satellite constellations being announced now will be using optical
ISLs. The SILEX optical communication system is another example; its payload was embarked on the
European Space Agency’s ARTEMIS (advanced relay and technology mission satellite) spacecraft and
also on the French Earth observation satellite SPOT-4. It uses GaAlAs laser diodes as the source and is
used to transmit data at 50 Mbps from a low Earth orbit to a geostationary orbit.
TSAT (transformational satellite system) is another example of a contemporary satellite constellation
(Figure 14.51) employing laser inter-satellite links. The system is designed to provide a protected, secure
Internet-like communication system that integrates space, air, ground and sea networks. The TSAT
program is composed of three segments and a systems engineering and integration function. The space
segment will consist of ﬁve satellites in geosynchronous orbits interconnected by high-data-rate laser

cross-links. TSAT will use Internet-like technology to connect war ﬁghters all over the world in a global
information network with unprecedented carrying capacity, accessibility, reliability and immunity to
jamming, eavesdropping and nuclear effects. It is the backbone of 21st century net-centric warfare and is
projected to revolutionize military communications.
14.5.3
Fibre-optic Communication
Some of the key limitations of free-space optical communication encountered due to atmospheric
propagation issues are overcome in the case of ﬁbre-optic communication. In practice, laser-based
communication is dominated today by ﬁbre-optic transmission. Earlier, the lifetimes of semiconductor
diode lasers and the ﬁbre losses were too high to make laser-based ﬁbre-optic communication an
attractive alternative to other forms of communication. With advances in both semiconductor diode laser
and ﬁbre technologies, these shortcomings have been overcome. State-of-the-art semiconductor diode
lasers have lifetimes of greater than 107 hours and ﬁbre loss is as small as a small fraction of 1 dB km1.
Today, ﬁbre-optic communication links are a reality for both intra-city and trunk telephone lines, video
data links and computer-to-computer communications.
A semiconductor diode laser is the natural choice for ﬁbre-optic communication as they have a
suitably small size and conﬁguration for efﬁcient coupling into the small diameter core of an optical ﬁbre
cable. Semiconductor diode lasers operating at CW power levels of a few milliwatts are suitable for ﬁbre-
optic communication. As described in Chapter 5, these lasers can be easily modulated by drive current
modulation up to frequencies in the gigahertz range.
Laser wavelengths in use for ﬁbre-optic communication are 0.85 mm, 1.3 mm and 1.55 mm. The ﬁrst
practical ﬁbre-optic communication systems employed the wavelength 0.85 mm as it matched the
available AlGaAs lasers. With advances in ﬁbre technology and the opening up of lower-loss windows
ﬁrst at 1.3 mm and then at 1.55 mm, these became the preferred wavelengths for long-distance high-
performance systems. Corresponding semiconductor diode laser and detector types for these operational
wavelengths are AlGaAs and silicon for 0.85 mm, InGaAsP and InGaAs or germanium for 1.3 mm and
InGaAsP and InGaAs for 1.55 mm. Typical ﬁbre losses at these wavelengths are 2 dB km1 at 0.85 mm,
0.5 dB km1 at 1.3 mm and 0.2 dB km1 at 1.55 mm.
Fibres with bandwidth-distance products approaching 3000 MHz km are available. Semiconductor
diode lasers with 10 mW power level, modulation rate approaching 10 GHz and lifetime of 107 hours are
also available. LEDs providing 0.1 mW into the ﬁbre with a modulation rate of 200 MHz and lifetime of
the order of 106–107 are also available. PIN-type photodiodes with responsivity and NEP ﬁgures of
0.5 AW1 and 1012 W Hz0.5, respectively, are also used. More sensitive APDs with responsivity and
NEP ﬁgures of 80–100 AW1 and 1014 W Hz0.5 are commercially available for the purpose. Couplers
and splices with insertion loss in the range of 0.1–0.5 dB are available for use. Splices are usually added
to the link to allow ﬁbre cable repair in case of need.
Figure 14.52 shows a typical ﬁbre-optic communication link. The laser is pulse-code-modulated with
intelligence to be transmitted through drive current modulation and is coupled into the ﬁbre. On the
receiver side, laser light is detected and the intelligence signal is recovered. Optical ampliﬁers are used to
reinforce the signal strength every few kilometres of ﬁbre cable length to counter signal degradation
caused by various loss mechanisms such as absorption, scattering and modal and chromatic dispersion.
To summarize, the process of ﬁbre-optic communication involves generating the optical signal
modulated with intelligence to be transmitted using a transmitter, relaying the signal along the ﬁbre
ensuring that the signal does not become too distorted or weak, receiving the optical signal, and
converting it back into an electrical signal representing the original intelligence signal.
We have seen four generations of ﬁbre-optic communication and are currently in the ﬁfth generation.
The ﬁrst-generation system operated at 0.85 mm wavelength, at a bit rate of 45 Mbps, with repeater
spacing of up to 10 km. In April 1977, General Telephone and Electronics sent the ﬁrst live telephone
trafﬁc using ﬁbre optics at a 6 Mbps data rate in Long Beach, California. The second generation of ﬁbre-
optic communication operated at 1.3 mm, and used InGaAsP semiconductor lasers. These ﬁbre-optic
systems were initially limited by dispersion of multimode ﬁbres. The advent of single-mode ﬁbres in
Military Applications: Laser Instrumentation
559

1981 signiﬁcantly improved system performance. Third-generation ﬁbre-optic systems operated at
1.55 mm. The difﬁculty faced earlier in terms of pulse spreading at 1.55 mm was largely overcome by
using dispersion-shifted ﬁbres designed to have minimal dispersion at 1.55 mm or by limiting the laser
spectrum to a single longitudinal mode. The features of third-generation systems allowed commercial
ﬁbre-optic systems to operate at 2.5 Gbps with repeater spacing in excess of 100 km. The fourth
generation of ﬁbre-optic communication systems used optical ampliﬁcation to reduce the need for
repeaters. It also explored the use of wavelength-division multiplexing to increase data capacity. These
features brought revolutionary improvements to the performance of ﬁbre-optic systems. In fact, since the
beginning of 1992, the data rate has doubled every six months until it reached a ﬁgure of 10 Tbps in 2000.
In 2006 a bit-rate of 14 Tbps was reached over a single 160 km line using optical ampliﬁers.
In the ﬁfth generation of ﬁbre-optic communications systems, the focus is on extending the
wavelength range over which a WDM system can operate. The conventional wavelength window,
known as the C-band, covers the wavelength range 1.53–1.57 mm. The dry ﬁbre has promised an
extension of that range to 1.30–1.65 mm. Other features of ﬁfth-generation ﬁbre-optic systems include
the concept of optical solitons, which involves the use of pulses of a speciﬁc shape that helps them
preserve their shape by counteracting the effects of dispersion with the non-linear effects of the ﬁbre.
Example 14.6

other end of the ﬁbre. Determine ﬁbre loss in dB km1. If this ﬁbre is used in a ﬁbre-optic communication
link and the detector used is able to satisfactorily detect a 40 dBm signal, determine how long the ﬁbre-
optic link can be without a repeater?
Solution
 Power loss ratio in the ﬁbre ¼ 1/1.0  103 ¼ 1000 ¼ 10 log 1000 dB ¼ 30 dB
 Length of ﬁbre ¼ 30 km
 Therefore, ﬁbre loss ¼ 30/30 ¼ 1.0 dB km1
 Minimum detectable signal power ¼ 40 dBm
 Input laser power ¼ 1.0 mW ¼ 0 dBm
 Therefore, acceptable ﬁbre loss ¼ 40 dB
 Fibre loss ¼ 1.0 dB km1
 Therefore, ﬁbre length without repeater ¼ 40/1 ¼ 40 km.

Summary
 The most common tactical battleﬁeld applications of lasers and optoelectronic devices are as laser
rangeﬁnders and laser target designators for munitions guidance.
 Military applications of lasers and related electro-optic devices are due to technological advances in
optics, optoelectronics and electronics. Laser devices are indispensable in modern warfare due to their
rugged, reliable, compact and efﬁcient nature.
 Laser-based proximity sensors, gap-measuring devices and obstacle avoidance systems, laser
bathymetry and laser tracking are some examples of use of the principle of laser range ﬁnding.
 Lasers and optoelectronics devices and systems are ﬁnding widespread use in low-intensity conﬂict
(LIC) operations, due to their properties of near-zero collateral damage, speed of light delivery and
potential for building non-lethal weapons.
 Some of the well-established laser devices in LIC applications include laser dazzlers for close combat
operations, mob/riot control and protection of critical infrastructures from aerial threats; lidar sensors
for detection of chemical, biological and explosive agents; femtosecond lasers for imaging of
concealed weapons; and lasers for sniper and gun ﬁre location identiﬁcation.
 A very common application of a laser device when attached to a ﬁrearm is as an aiming device. Laser
aiming modules are usually conﬁgured around low-power semiconductor diode lasers emitting in the
visible or infrared.
 A laser rangeﬁnder is used in military applications to determine distance to the intended target. It is
used both as a standalone device as well as an integral part of a ﬁre control system of main battle tanks
and other armoured ﬁghting vehicles. Commonly used techniques for determination of range include
time-of-ﬂight principle, triangulation method and multiple frequency phase shift method.
 A laser target designator for munitions guidance applications is a high-repetition-rate Q-switched laser
source whose pulse repetition frequency is coded in order to allow only a speciﬁc target designator and
laser seeker combination to work in unison for the intended mission. Laser target designators for
handheld applications as well as for land-based and aerial platforms are also available.
 A laser proximity sensor is a type of laser rangeﬁnder designed to accurately measure relatively
smaller distances to targets, for applications such as observation and surveillance and ﬁre control.
 Laser bathymetry is a technique of measuring depths of water bodies, usually of relatively shallow
coastal waters, using a scanning pulsed laser beam. Measurement is usually performed from an
airborne platform, which gives it the name airborne laser bathymetry (ALB).
 Laser bathymetry makes use of the transmissive and reﬂective properties of water and the bottom of
the water body to measure the depth.
 Laser radar, also called ladar, uses a laser beam instead of microwaves. The higher operating
frequency means higher operating bandwidth, greater time or range resolution, enhanced angular
resolution and immunity to jamming. Higher frequencies associated with laser radars permit detection
of smaller objects. This is made possible by the fact that laser radar output wavelengths are much
smaller than the small-sized practical objects we can think of.
 A common application of ladar concept is in ladar seekers, used mainly in conjunction with other
guidance systems on strategic payloads for intended target discrimination from advanced decoys and
aim point selection.
 A forward-looking infrared (FLIR) sensor makes use of thermal radiation emitted by the target or
the scene of interest to generate its image. It essentially comprises a front-end optical system, a
2D array of infrared detectors and image processing circuitry to produce the output in desired
format.
 Different guidance techniques discussed in this section include beam rider guidance, command
guidance, homing guidance and navigation guidance.
 The concept of beam riding guidance of munitions is based on radar or a laser beam constantly pointed
towards the target throughout the ﬂight time of the munitions. The missile is launched and ﬂies into the
radar or laser beam. From this stage onwards, the missile attempts to keep itself inside the beam, while
the aiming station always keeps the beam pointed at the target.

 In the case of command guidance, the missile is commanded on an intercept course with the target.
This is achieved by using two separate radars to continuously track the target and the missile. Tracking
data from these radars is fed to a computer that computes the trajectories of the two vehicles. The
computer in turn sends appropriate command signals over a radio link to the missile. A sensor onboard
the missile decodes the commands and operates the control surfaces of the missile to adjust its course
in order to intercept the target in ﬂight.
 Homing guidance is divided into semi-active, active, passive and track-via-missile homing, also
known as retransmission homing. In the case of semi-active homing guidance, the target is
illuminated by an external source which could be radar or laser. For active homing guidance,
the source of target designation is also onboard the weapon with the result that this methodology
does not require an external source. Passive homing guidance makes use of some form of energy
emitted by the target which is intercepted by the missile seeker. In retransmission homing guidance,
the target is illuminated by an external radar and the reﬂected energy is intercepted by the missile
sensor.
 Navigation guidance is divided into inertial, ranging, celestial and geophysical navigation. In the
case of inertial navigation guidance, the vehicle uses onboard sensors to determine its motion and
acceleration with the help of gyroscopes and accelerometers. Ranging navigation depends on
external signals for guidance, which are usually provided by radio beacons. Celestial navigation,
one of the oldest types of navigation, uses the positions of the stars to determine location, especially
latitude, on the surface of the Earth. Geophysical navigation guidance depends on the measure-
ments made by compasses and magnetometers of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld as well as gravi-
tometers to measure the Earth’s gravitational ﬁeld. This technique has not found much application
in missile guidance.
 A ring laser gyroscope is primarily a rate sensor, which can be used to measure rotation by integrating
the rate information. It consists of two counter-propagating laser beams over the same path. It operates
on the principle of the Sagnac effect, which describes how the null points of the internal standing wave
pattern produced by the counter-propagating laser modes shift in response to angular rotation.
Important parameters that describe a ring laser gyroscope’s performance include bias error, bias drift
and instability, scale factor non-linearity and angular random walk.
 The operational principle of a ﬁbre-optic gyroscope is also based on Sagnac effect. It consists of a long
coil of optical ﬁbre (typically a few kilometres in length) and makes use of the interference of light to
detect mechanical rotation.
 Optical communication technology uses light propagating in free space to transmit data for tele-
communications or computer networking. Free-space optical communication and ﬁbre-optic com-
munication are widely used modes of optical communication. The key advantages of optical
communication, whether ﬁbre optic, free space or underwater, include high achievable data trans-
mission rates, low bit error rates, immunity to electromagnetic interference, full duplex operation,
higher communication security and no necessity for the Fresnel zone. Key disadvantages include beam
dispersion, particularly in free space and underwater communication applications, signal attenuation
due to atmospheric absorption and adverse weather conditions, scintillation and signal swamping
when the sun goes exactly behind the transmitter.

Military Applications:
Directed-energy Laser Systems
15.1
Introduction
Chapter 14 focused on the relatively low-power/energy military applications of lasers, covering
instrumentation and sensors such as laser rangeﬁnders, laser target designators, electro-optical guidance
techniques, optronic sensors used for navigation and free-space and ﬁbre-optic laser communication.
This chapter describes optical and electro-optical devices for the detection of chemical, biological and
explosive agents, and provides information on directed-energy applications of lasers and optoelectronics
devices and systems. These include the use of laser technology for low-intensity conﬂict applications,
electro-optic and infrared countermeasures and directed-energy laser weapons.
15.2
Laser Technology for Low-intensity Conﬂict (LIC) Applications
The present-day warfare scenario is that of low-intensity conﬂict (LIC), and is likely to remain so in the
foreseeable future. Data suggest that more than 75% of the armed conﬂicts since World War II have been
of the low-intensity variety. Low-intensity conﬂict operation is a military term used for deployment and
use of troops and/or assets in situations other than conventional war. Compared to a war, armed forces
engaged in low-intensity conﬂict operate with fewer soldiers, a reduced range of tactical equipment and
limited scope to operate in a military manner. The use of artillery is avoided in the case of conﬂicts in
urban territories, and use of air power is often restricted to surveillance and transportation of personnel
and equipment.
Low-intensity conﬂicts pose an alarming threat to national security and are an area of concern for the
whole of the international community today. LIC extends from combating illegal drug trafﬁcking to
protection of critical infrastructures; from handling counter-insurgency and anti-terrorist operations to
detection of chemical and biological warfare agents; and from detection and identiﬁcation of explosive
agents (including improvised explosive devices frequently used by terrorist and anti-national elements)
to detection of concealed weapons. In an urban terrorism scenario, even sanitisation of strategic areas
from an attack by sharp shooters or constant observation and surveillance of suspect elements has
become very important.
15.2.1
Importance of Laser Technology in LIC Applications
Laser and optoelectronics technologies play an important role in handling low-intensity conﬂict
situations. The key advantage of the use of laser technology in such applications mainly stems from
Lasers and Optoelectronics: Fundamentals, Devices and Applications, First Edition. Anil K. Maini.
 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Published 2013 by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

its near-zero collateral damage, speed of light delivery and potential for building non-lethal weapons.
Some of the well-established laser devices in LIC applications include laser dazzlers for close combat
operations, mob/riot control and protection of critical infrastructures from aerial threats; lidar sensors for
detection of chemical, biological and explosive agents; femtosecond lasers for imaging of concealed
weapons; and lasers for sniper and gun ﬁre location identiﬁcation.
Use of laser vibrometry and electron speckle interferometry techniques for detection of buried mines
and high-power lasers for disposal of unexploded ordnances are emerging applications of laser
technology for homeland security. In the subsequent sections are brieﬂy described both established
and emerging applications of laser and optoelectronics technologies for use in homeland security in
terms of salient features, potential usage and international developments.
15.2.2
Detection of Chemical and Biological Warfare Agents
The importance of efﬁcient and reliable technologies for stand-off detection and identiﬁcation of
chemical, biological and explosive agents has become increasingly important today. Chemical and
biological weapons are relatively inexpensive to produce and are capable of unleashing a devastating
effect as a terrorist weapon. The international community has already witnessed the devastating
effects these weapons are capable of causing on more than one occasion. Millions have been affected
by the destruction caused by these weapons of mass destruction in the past. The sarin attack by the
Aum Shinrikyo cult in 1995 in a Tokyo subway, hydrogen cyanide, mustard gas attack by Iraq in the
Anfal campaign against the Kurds (most notably in Halabja massacre in 1988) and the international
dispersal of anthrax spores in the US in 2001 are some examples of chemical and biological weapons
attack. Use of improvised explosive devices by terrorists and anti-national elements killing soldiers
and civilians alike has become a routine affair. These incidents have highlighted the need for stand-
off detection and identiﬁcation of chemical, biological and explosive agents. In the following
sections we discuss some laser-based methodologies/techniques that are either in use or being
explored for the purpose.
15.2.2.1
Detection of Chemical Warfare Agents
Due to their acute toxicity, rapidity of action, indetectability by human senses and economic viability,
nerve agents such as organophosphonate compounds and blister agents such as mustard compounds are
two potentially very harmful classes of chemical warfare agents. Nerve agents are the organophosphorus
esters, which initially stimulate and then paralyze certain nerve transmissions by interfering with the
cholinesterase enzyme. Common chemical warfare agents belonging to this category include tabun,
sarin, soman, VX, dichlorvos and malathion. Victims of chemical warfare agent attack are depicted in
Figure 15.1.
Lidar-based detection is the most practically realizable technique for stand-off detection of chemical
and biological warfare agents. Commonly exploited physical phenomena forming the basis of chemical
and biological agent detection include elastic backscattering, laser-induced ﬂuorescence and differential
absorption. They are superior to point detection systems such as infrared spectroscopy and Raman
spectroscopy because of their capability to range and discriminate the chemical and biological molecules
in real time. Ultraviolet laser-induced ﬂuorescence is used for the detection of biological molecules
since most ﬂuoresce when excited by ultraviolet radiation.
Differential absorption lidar (DIAL) is the most frequently used technique for the detection of
chemical warfare agents along with detection of toxic gases and pollutants. It uses two wavelengths: one
corresponds to the wavelength of peak absorption of the targeted molecule (‘on’ wavelength) and the
other corresponds to the weak absorption of the targeted molecule (‘off’ wavelength). The ratio of
the two received backscattered signals is a measure of the concentration of the targeted chemical warfare
agent. Figure 15.2 shows the block schematic arrangement of DIAL system. Two laser pulses are
transmitted towards the targeted area of interest in the atmosphere that is suspected to be contaminated
with a potentially harmful chemical warfare agent.
Military Applications: Directed-energy Laser Systems
567

The choice of ‘on’ and ‘off’ wavelengths is unique for a given chemical species and is determined
by using a tunable laser that scans the area of interest by transmitting pairs of these wavelengths. The
on-wavelength lon encounters maximum absorption with the result that the corresponding back-
scattered signal is relatively weak compared to the loff, which encounters weak absorption and hence
a relatively stronger backscattered signal. This forms the basis of knowing atmospheric constituents at
that time. The ratio of the two backscattered signals yields the concentration of the molecule of
interest.
Many of the chemical warfare agents experience signiﬁcant absorption in the 3–4 mm and 9–11 mm
bands. CO2 lasers emitting in the 9–11 mm band have been commonly used for the detection of the
majority of chemical agents. Some DIAL systems do make use of both these bands and therefore
employ both tunable mid-infrared as well as CO2 laser sources. The schematic arrangement of DIAL
system shown in Figure 15.2 only makes use of a CO2 laser, however. After suitable collimation, the
transmit laser beam is directed towards the atmosphere in the desired direction with the help of a
scanning gimbal mirror. The backscattered signal is received by the receiving telescope and is further
focused onto the detector subsystem. An interference ﬁlter is used to block the undesired radiation and
allow only the radiation of wavelength of interest to pass through it. The detected signal is then
digitized and fed to the data processor to extract the desired information on the type and concentration
of the chemical species.
15.2.2.2
Detection of Biological Agents
Stand-off detection of biological warfare agents and their discrimination from background aerosols is
extremely challenging, as the distinction between innocuous ambient bacteria and virulent microbes
amounts to subtle differences in their molecular make-up. As these subtle differences involve a very
small percentage of molecules, they produce a very small change in their optical signatures. This
makes it extremely difﬁcult to reliably detect and discriminate these potentially dangerous molecules.
The processes of detection and discrimination are further complicated by the fact that there is a
constant variation in the growth media and the contaminants associated with the processing of
biological warfare agents affect their optical signatures. Figure 15.3 shows the effects of a biological
warfare agent attack.
Figure 15.1
Effect of chemical weapon attack.
568
Lasers and Optoelectronics

The stand-off detection of biological warfare agents is based on the concept of the laser-induced
ﬂuorescence (LIF) effect. Laser-induced ﬂuorescence is the emission from atoms or molecules after they
have been excited to higher energy levels by excitation by another laser. The emission takes place at a
wavelength that is higher than the wavelength of the exciting laser light. The biological warfare agent
molecules mainly constitute aromatic amino acids and coenzymes. Aromatic amino acids such
as tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylanine absorb laser radiation at 280–290 nm and ﬂuoresce in the
300–400 nm bands. It is therefore possible to detect biological warfare agents by using UV laser
Figure 15.3
Effects of biological warfare attack.
Figure 15.2
Block schematic of differential absorption lidar.
Military Applications: Directed-energy Laser Systems
569

excitation at a suitable wavelength. Discrimination of biological agents can only be achieved from the
LIF signal because the ﬂuorescence cross-section for particles in the range 1–10 mm are sufﬁciently large
to make single particle interrogation feasible.
Figure 15.4 shows the block schematic arrangement of a typical monostatic UV-LIF lidar system. The
principle components of this lidar system include a frequency-tripled or -quadrupled Nd:YAG laser
emitting at 355 nm and 266 nm respectively, a telescope used for both transmission and reception, a
photomultiplier tube (PMT) used for recording the backscattered signal and the bio-ﬂuorescence signal,
a spectrograph with a gated intensiﬁed charged-couple device (ICCD) array for recording the dispersed
ﬂuorescence spectra and the lidar controller.
The fourth harmonic at 266 nm is transmitted towards the biological cloud. The telescope receives the
backscattered and the bio-ﬂuorescence signal, which is then fed to the PMT channel. The backscattered
signal is received by the gated PMT channel and is present whenever there is a cloud along the beam path.
This channel is used to measure the distance to the cloud. A solar-blind PMT channel is used to receive
the ﬂuorescence signal and is activated only when there is a suspicious cloud. A spectrograph with a
gated ICCD is used to identify the nature of the bio-molecule that is responsible for the ﬂuorescence. The
bandwidth of the receiver channel is usually kept smaller in order to prevent unwanted background
radiation entering the channel.
15.2.3
Detection of Explosive Agents
Stand-off detection of explosive agents using lasers and based on the trace detection method is one of the
most widely researched technologies internationally. For the technology to mature to an extent where it
can be transformed into a product usable in the kind of environment and ﬁeld conditions usually
encountered in homeland security applications is a great technological challenge.
One of the major problems is the decrease in the intensity of the backscattered light signal due to
wavelength-dependent absorption and scattering losses and the intensity decreasing inversely with
distance squared. The problem is compounded by the fact that the trace levels associated with common
explosive agents are extremely low, in the range of a fraction of ppb (parts per billion) to a few ppm (parts
per million) for common explosives.
Figure 15.4
Block schematic arrangement of UV-LIF lidar system for detection of biological agents.
570
Lasers and Optoelectronics

The second major problem relates to the unique identiﬁcation of the targeted explosive agent against a
background of interferents. Many chemical agents have atomic compositions including sulphur,
phosphorus, ﬂuorine and chlorine in addition to nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and carbon present in
organic molecules. The detection methodology therefore needs to be highly sensitive and selective.
Laser-based spectrometric methods have the potential of being fast, sensitive and selective with the
ability to detect and identify a wide range of explosive agents and to be upgraded to handle new threats.
Atmospheric transmission at the wavelengths concerned is an important factor while assessing
suitability of a given stand-off detection methodology. Commonly used technologies are laser-induced
breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), Raman spectroscopy and its variants, laser-induced ﬂuorescence (LIF)
spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy. These are all trace detection methods; bulk detection methods such as
millimetre wave imaging and terahertz spectroscopy are also available.
Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy focuses a high-energy laser beam on the trace sample to break
down a small part of it into a plasma of excited ions and atoms. The plasma emits light that is
characteristic of emissions from ionic, atomic and small molecular species. These light emissions are
detected by a spectrometer to identify the elemental composition. Figure 15.5 shows a typical laser-
induced breakdown spectroscopy set-up. One of the challenges in the use of LIBS is to assess its efﬁcacy
to detect and identify explosive species in a real environment that is replete with many interfering
substances. One method of obtaining the desired selectivity is to use a double-pulse LIBS; the ﬁrst pulse
is used to create so-called laser-generated vacuum and the second pulse, transmitted a few microseconds
later, generates the return signal. Double-pulse LIBS is also observed to improve sensitivity in addition to
enhancing selectivity. Selectivity can be further improved by adding temporal resolution to the LIBS
emission analysis.
The wavelength 1064 nm has been widely employed for LIBS systems. Due to serious eye hazards
posed by 1064 nm, scientists have also tried 266 nm. The latter also allows the designer to build Raman
capability into the system. It may be mentioned here that the wavelength 266 nm has 600 times higher
maximum permissible exposure (MPE) limit compared to that of 1064 nm.
Raman spectroscopy (Figure 15.6) offers another method for the stand-off detection of explosive
agents. It has been extensively used for many years as a standard analytical tool for identiﬁcation of
chemical agents in the laboratory environment. The basis of detection in this case is the shift in the
wavelength caused by inelastic Raman scattering by the target molecule. The inelastic scattering of
impinging photons, where some energy is lost to (or gained from) the target molecule, returns scattered
light with a higher (or lower) wavelength depending upon whether energy was lost to (or gained from)
Figure 15.5
Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy set-up.
Military Applications: Directed-energy Laser Systems
571

the target molecule. The difference is dictated by the energy of vibrational modes of the target molecule,
and therefore constitutes the ﬁngerprint or the basis of identiﬁcation. Complex mixtures are identiﬁed
using algorithms for pattern recognition.
A major drawback of the Raman technique is its extremely poor sensitivity caused by the fact that
Raman scattering occurs for 1 in about 107 photons impinging on the sample. The weak return-signal
intensity of Raman spectroscopy limits its use for trace detection, as it is also sensitive to ambient light
and ﬂuorescence from the sample itself or other chemicals in the vicinity. The ﬂuorescence masks the
Raman signal. These problems are overcome by use of resonant Raman spectroscopy. With a tunable
laser, the wavelength can be chosen to match or nearly match a resonant absorption in the target
molecule, leading to intensity enhancement of the order of 106. The problem of ﬂuorescence masking the
Raman signal can also be overcome by use of either infrared or ultraviolet radiation. Infrared radiation
does not have sufﬁcient energy to cause ﬂuorescence and ultraviolet radiation will cause ﬂuorescence in
the visible, which is easily separated from the Raman signal.
Laser-induced ﬂuorescence (LIF) is another important tool for similar applications. Although a very
valuable tool in combustion diagnostics and for studying the decomposition of explosives, it has not been
found to be very useful for the detection of explosive agents.
Almost all the laser-based stand-off detection methods have detection limits too high to make them
suitable for the detection of explosives in ﬁeld conditions, which require the ability to detect traces in the
vapour phase or in the form of particles. Another problem is insufﬁcient selectivity to identify the target
explosive in the presence of interferents. None of the laser-based spectroscopic methodologies available
today is ready for full functionality prototype manufacturing. There is much scope for further research to
improve the performance of the more mature technologies in terms of both detection sensitivity and
selectivity. The ﬁnal solution probably lies in the integration of several technologies to derive the beneﬁts
from each.

15.2.4
Detection of Optical and Electro-optic Devices
Another emerging application of laser technology is in the detection and identiﬁcation of battleﬁeld
optical and optoelectronic sighting systems, which includes optical scopes, night-vision devices, thermal
imagers, laser rangeﬁnders and target designators. The device operates on the principle of the cat’s eye
effect as shown in Figure 15.7. The target optical device is illuminated by a laser beam and the optical
system returns a fraction of it as backscattered energy, which is received by a sensitive receiver. With
particular reference to homeland security, such a device could be very useful for the detection of optical
scopes employed by snipers. Another security-related application could be surveillance of sensitive
areas, particularly in urban territories. Figure 15.8 illustrates a typical deployment scenario of such a
device in an urban environment when used for sanitization of the area.
One such international system is the Laser Sniper Detector from CILAS, France which is available in
two variants: SLD-400 and SLD-500. Figure 15.9 is a photograph of the SLD-400, which can be ﬁtted on
a tripod or on a static vehicle. Its highly accurate threat detection and localization capability is
compatible with the performance of the associated weapon or ﬁre control system.
Figure 15.10 is a photograph of a similar system, the Optiﬁnder-1200 from M/s Torrey Pines Inc. The
Optiﬁnder-1200 is an active system designed to detect the retro-reﬂected signal caused by the front-end
optics of the target system. It uses a combination of a high-sensitivity detector and optical ﬁlter to offer a
maximum operational range of 1200 m. It also makes use of time-of-ﬂight calculation of the transmitted
signal and the retro-reﬂected signal to compute the target range. The chosen detector offers day/night
operational capability. The system allows penetration through bad weather and vegetation by range

gating. Three variants of the optiﬁnder system are available with operational ranges of 350 m, 1200 m
and 2000 m.
15.2.5
Disposal of Unexploded Ordnances
The disposal of unexploded ordnances including surface-laid mines, improvised explosive devices
(IED), grenade shells, artillery/mortar rounds and cluster bombs from safe stand-off ranges using a high-
power laser beam is an emerging application of directed-energy laser systems. Ordnance is disposed of
by focusing a high-power laser beam on the ordnance casing, heating it until the temperature of the
backplane of the casing exceeds ignition temperature of the explosive ﬁller. The explosive ﬁller ignites
and begins to burn, independent of the type of fusing used by the target explosive. This leads to a low-
level detonation or deﬂagration rather than full-power detonation. The advantages of the use of laser
energy for ordnance disposal include large-magazine high-precision controllable effects with reduced
collateral damage and safe and fast disposal from stand-off ranges.
One such international system is the ZEUS-HLONS (HUMMWV Laser Ordnance Neutralization
System) of USA. Figure 15.11 is a photograph of the system. The concept of neutralization of live
ordnances using laser energy was ﬁrst demonstrated in the ﬁeld in 1994 with development and ﬁeld
testing of a mobile ordnance disrupter system (MODS) that employed a 1.1 kW arc-lamp-driven solid-
state laser mounted on an M113 A2 armoured personnel carrier. The ZEUS system initially employed a

500 W laser; the latest version of the ZEUS system is equipped with a 2 kW ﬁbre laser mounted on the
roof of an adapted Humvee vehicle.
Another laser system designed for the disposal of unexploded ordnances is the Laser Avenger system
from Boeing combat systems (Figure 15.12) . Boeing successfully tested a 1 kW solid-state laser weapon
mounted on a converted anti-aircraft vehicle in Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville Alabama by neutralizing
multiple types of improvised explosive devices, including large-calibre artillery munitions and mortar
rounds. The system was operated at safe distances from the targets under a variety of conditions
including different angles and ranges.

15.2.6
Non-lethal Laser Dazzlers
Non-lethal weapons act as a force multiplier, enabling friendly forces to discourage, delay or prevent
hostile action. They are particularly effective in situations where use of lethal force is not preferred,
examples being limiting escalation and temporarily disabling facilities and equipment. Laser-based non-
lethal weapons such as laser dazzlers can be used for counter-insurgency, anti-terrorism, crowd control
and infrastructure protection applications. Laser dazzlers are emerging internationally as a new non-
lethal alternative to lethal force for law enforcement, homeland security, border patrol, coastal
protection, infrastructure protection and a host of other low-intensity conﬂict scenarios.
A laser dazzler emits a high-intensity laser beam in the visible band, usually in the blue-green region,
to temporarily impair the vision of the adversary without causing any permanent or lasting injury to
the subject’s eyes. Figure 15.13 illustrates the use of a laser dazzler in a close-combat scenario and
Figure 15.14 demonstrates the use of a vehicle-mounted laser dazzler system for unruly crowd/mob
control applications. Such vehicles are usually equipped with remotely controlled weapon stations for a
wide range of applications. The technology of the short-range and crowd-control laser dazzlers is similar,
but the latter system employs a higher power to be able to produce the desired power density in a larger
beam spot. Some means of scanning the laser beam spot may also be necessary.
Laser dazzlers are also being considered as a potential candidate for warning the crew of commercial
airliners or military aircraft who violate (intentionally or unintentionally) a no-ﬂy zone. Such systems in
a networked conﬁguration of multiple laser dazzler stations and radars could be effectively used for the
protection of critical infrastructure or assets. In such a system, radar provides the initial cue to the rogue
or suspect aircraft when it is more than 100 km away from the actual asset to be protected. The radar
keeps a constant vigil on the suspect aircraft until it comes within the tracking range of the electro-optic
tracker, which is usually an integral part of the laser dazzler station. The electro-optic tracker station
takes the cue from the radar and tracks the target with the much higher accuracy needed for the dazzling
action. The blue-green region is the chosen wavelength band as the response of the human eye is highest
in this band, as shown in Figure 15.15. The most commonly employed wavelength for this purpose is
532 nm, usually generated by using either laser diodes or frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser modules.

576
Lasers and Optoelectronics

A laser dazzler is a non-lethal weapon speciﬁcally designed for applications where subject vision
impairment is to be achieved at a distance ranging from a few tens of metres to several kilometres in
bright ambient conditions.
The choice of performance parameters such as laser power, spot size at the target and laser power
density are driven by the nature of deployment. The beam shaping and directing optics are designed to
achieve the desired value of nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and a laser power density that does
not exceed the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) ﬁgure dictated by ANSI (American National
Standards Institute) standards for eye safety.
The MPE is dependent on wavelength and exposure time. At 532 nm, maximum permissible power
density is 2.5 mW cm2 and 1.0 mW cm2 for exposure times of 0.25 s and 10 s, respectively. These
devices usually produce a randomly pulsed output in the range of 10–20 Hz, riding a DC level for better

overall effect. DC level is usually kept at 30–50% of the peak intensity level. Night-time maximum
operational range is typically 3–4 times the maximum daytime operational range.
A large number of companies are offering short- to medium-range laser dazzler systems for various
application scenarios. One such short-range laser dazzler is the Compact High Power (CHP) laser dazzler
from LE systems, USA. The dazzler emits a 500 mW ﬂashing green dazzling laser beam and is capable of
engaging targets at distances of up to 200 m.
The GLARE MOUT is a non-lethal visual disruption laser with an effective range of 0.15–2 km. The
device is ideally suited for small arms integration as well as mobile crew-served applications. When a
suspect individual approaches a restricted or controlled area, such a device can be used to give warning to
that person before shots have to be ﬁred. Its shockingly bright green beam sends an irrefutable,
multilingual, cross-cultural message that cannot be ignored. Reports conﬁrm that the GLARE MOUT
has saved numerous lives of both soldiers and non-combatants in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The GLARE GBD-IIIC (Figure 15.16) is a long-range variant of the GLARE MOUT, and is a visual
deterrent laser device for hail and warning applications. The GLARE GBD-IIIC is an effective dazzler
ideally suited to ship-to-ship signalling or airborne over-watch. With twice the power and a more
concentrated beam than the GLARE MOUT, the GLARE GBD-IIIC can effectively hail and warn as far
away as 4 km. Like the GLARE MOUT, the GLARE GBD-IIIC produces an overtly bright green
diffused laser spot to impair the visual ability of a suspect.
The GLARE LA-9/P (Figure 15.17) is another long-range visual deterrent laser device for hail and
warning applications and is intended to be effective to a range of 0.3–4 km for ship-to-ship signalling or
airborne over-watch applications. The GLARE LA-9/P has an additional feature of automatically
shutting off the device if the subject target is within the nominal ocular hazard (NOHD) zone, shutting off
the glaring laser output if so to prevent any unintended eye injury.
The Sabre 203 grenade shell laser intruder countermeasure system (Figure 15.18) is a type of laser
dazzler that uses a 250 mW red laser diode mounted in a hard plastic capsule in the shape of a standard
40 mm grenade. It is suitable for being loaded into a M203 grenade launcher. It has an effective range of
300 m. It is controlled via a box snapped under the launcher, with the batteries and ﬁring switch housed in
this box. In emergency it can be quickly ejected and replaced with a grenade. Sabre 203 dazzlers were
used in Somalia in 1995 during operation United Shield.
The Chinese JD-3 laser dazzler and ZM-87 portable laser disruptor are also established systems. The
JD-3 laser dazzler is reported to be mounted on the Chinese Type 98 main battle tank and is coupled with
a laser radiation detector. It automatically aims for the enemy’s illuminating laser designator, attempting

to overwhelm its optical systems or blind the operator. The ZM-87 portable laser disturber is an electro-
optic countermeasure laser device. It can blind enemy troops up to a range of 2–3 km and temporarily
blind them at up to 10 km range. ZM-87 has reported been widely deployed, including in use on naval
vessels.
The Photonic Disruptor (Figure 15.18), classiﬁed as a threat-assessment laser illuminator (TALI), is
another non-lethal high-power green laser developed by Wicked Lasers, USA in cooperation with
Xtreme Alternative Defence Systems. This tactical laser is equipped with a versatile focus-adjustable
collimating lens to compensate for range and power intensity when used to either incapacitate an attacker
in close range or safely identify threats from a distance.
The Dazer Laser from Laser Energetics Inc, USA is another very popular device. It comes in two
variants: the Guardian (Figure 15.19) has a range of 1–300 m (model dependent) and the Defender has a
range of 1–2400 m (model dependent). Both variants temporarily impair the vision of the target
adversary and succeed in eliminating the threat’s ability to see, engage or effectively target the user.
This provides the user with a signiﬁcant advantage over the threat at longer and safer stand-off distances.
Both variants of the Dazer are designed to be eye safe at all ranges beyond 1 m, and meet the current
American National Standard Institute (ANSI) safety standard Z136.1.

Laser dazzlers have shown much promise and potential for a variety of low-intensity conﬂict
applications including close-quarter battle scenarios; border patrol and coastal surveillance; controlling
unruly and violent crowds and mobs; countering asymmetric threats particularly encountered in the
naval environment; and protection of critical infrastructure from terrorist attacks. Different variants of
these devices are being developed to suit different application requirements. While handheld portable
devices are offered to meet the short-range requirements of paramilitary and law enforcement agencies,
tripod- and vehicle-mounted versions equipped with support electro-optic sighting, target acquisition
and tracking devices are also being developed to meet the requirements of emerging scenarios.
15.3
Electro-optic Countermeasures
One of the relatively newer types of laser systems that have found recognition and wide acceptance by
the armed forces in the last couple of decades are those that can offer effective countermeasures against
the laser systems already in use. The relevance of electro-optic countermeasures (EOCM) equipment
stems from the fact that, whenever a particular defence technology has matured to a high level leading to
its widespread usage, investment is triggered in research and development efforts in the corresponding
countermeasure technologies and systems. This has already occurred in the case of radar and other
related military systems operating in the RF spectrum of electromagnetic radiation and in the case of
lasers and related devices operating in the optical spectrum.
15.3.1
Need and Relevance
There is wide use of electro-optic devices such as sighting and observation devices and laser systems
such as those used for range ﬁnding and target designation applications. Laser technology is quite mature
today, which has led to introduction of laser devices and systems for many new applications not
previously considered. Developed countries have expended much effort on the deployment of EOCM
systems.
The need to develop and deploy the EOCM class of laser systems that can offer effective counter-
measures against similar systems deployed by the armed forces of the adversary is more pertinent and
relevant today. No military platform, be it land based, aerial or shipborne, is free from the risk of
exposure to laser radiation. The activities of these platforms are under constant surveillance by various
kinds of electro-optic devices and optronic sensors. Rendering these devices and sensors ineffective in
the battleﬁeld therefore makes a huge difference to the battleﬁeld competence of a nation. The
deployment of EOCM devices and systems designed to incapacitate or neutralize the more conventional
laser devices and systems acts as a force multiplier, as a platform incapacitated in the enemy camp is a
platform added to your own. The survivability quotient of armed forces equipped with such a capability
is signiﬁcantly enhanced.
15.3.2
Passive and Active Countermeasures
Electro-optic countermeasures are broadly classiﬁed as passive and active countermeasures. Passive
countermeasures for platform protection include use of armour, camouﬂage, fortiﬁcation and other
protection technologies such as self-sealing fuel tank and so on. Armour is simply the protective covering
used on the platform to prevent damage caused to it through the use of direct-contact weapons or
Figure 15.19

580
Lasers and Optoelectronics

projectiles. The use of reactive armour is a common example. Camouﬂage is a form of visual deception.
With reference to electro-optic countermeasures, it is a methodology that helps military platforms
remain unnoticed by the adversary and is achieved by blending with the environment or by resembling
something else. Fortiﬁcations are military constructions designed to provide protection to speciﬁc
equipment, platforms and military bases. Self-sealing fuel tank technology prevents the fuel tanks of
aircraft from leaking and becoming ignited when attacked.
Active countermeasures comprise soft-kill and hard-kill countermeasures. Soft-kill countermeasures
change the electromagnetic, acoustic or other forms of signatures of the platform to be protected. This in
turn adversely affects the tracking or sensing capability of the incoming threat. With reference to electro-
optic countermeasures, the incoming threat could be a laser-guided bomb or projectile or an infrared-
guided missile. In the case of providing protection to land-based platforms from laser-assisted threats,
one common method of achieving this objective is through the use of smoke or aerosol screen to block
the radiation from the laser target designator, depriving the laser seeker in the guided munitions the
required guidance information. In the case of active countermeasures, means are adopted to counter-
attack the incoming threat. This may be achieved by neutralizing one of the elements responsible for the
functioning of the guided threat or by physically destroying the incoming threat by launching a counter
projectile in that direction. These are also known as active protection systems.
The hard-kill neutralizing capability of EOCMs can be illustrated by the case of laser-guided
munitions. A laser sensor on the platform to be protected senses the existence, PRF code and direction
of arrival of laser radiation from the laser target designator and then either generates a smoke/aerosol
screen by launching a salvo of grenades or sends another high-power/energy laser beam in the same
direction, thereby incapacitating the laser target designator. Another technique is to use the high-energy
laser radiation to illuminate a dummy target 100–200 m away from the platform to be protected, thereby
forcing the incoming laser-guided threat to land on the dummy target. This is a very attractive
proposition for the protection of critical and high-value military assets such as aircraft shelters and
ammunition depots during war. The use of infrared ﬂares by target aircraft to protect it from the attack of
infrared-guided surface-to-air or air-to-air infrared-guided missiles is yet another example.
The other type of hard-kill active protection system, launching a counter projectile towards the
incoming threat, is generally used in the terminal phase of the incoming threat. This leads to the physical
destruction of the threat by means of either blast and/or fragment action. The consequences of blast and/
or fragment action could be in the form of destabilization of kinetic energy penetrator, premature
initiation of charge or destruction of airframe. The Arena by Russia’s Kolomna-based engineering
design bureau (KBM) and Trophy from Rafael, Israel are well-known active protection systems of this
type, designed for the protection of land-based armoured ﬁghting vehicles.
15.3.3
Types of EOCM Equipment
There are two broad categories of EOCM equipment: the EOCM class of lasers such as anti-sensor lasers
and laser dazzlers, and the support devices such as laser threat detection systems.
From the viewpoint of countermeasures terminology, a laser dazzler may be viewed as a type of anti-
sensor laser where the target sensor is the human eye. Laser dazzlers were discussed in detail in Section
15.2.6. In the category of anti-sensor systems, we have systems capable of causing either a temporary
disability of electro-optic devices and optronic sensors deployed by the adversary, or those capable of
inﬂicting a permanent damage. In both cases, the target is the front-end optics and optronic sensors.
These are sometimes referred to as soft-kill systems, as they have no capability to inﬂict physical or
structural damage to the platform carrying weapons. Hard-kill EOCM systems that are capable of
inﬂicting physical damage to the front-end optics of any electro-optic system are usually vehicle
mounted and are much larger in size and weight than their soft-kill counterparts. The pulse energy level
in such lasers is of the order of several kilojoules, compared to a few joules in the case of soft-kill
systems.
A laser warning sensor system is an indispensable component of any EOCM system, whether
designed for soft-kill or hard-kill. It provides information on the type and direction-of-arrival of laser
Military Applications: Directed-energy Laser Systems
581

threats emanating from the adversary camp. A laser warning system provides valuable information
that enables the platform crew to make an optimum choice regarding the type and modus operandi of
the countermeasure system to be used. When used in conjunction with a smoke/aerosol screening
system, the information provided by the sensor is used to trigger and deploy an optimal aerosol/smoke
screen in the direction of the threat and block the incoming radiation. This allows the crew of the
platform to take evasive action during those crucial 50–60 s for which smoke screen remains effective.
This type of defensive countermeasure action is particularly effective against laser-guided munitions
attack.
In the case of an active electro-optic countermeasures system equipped with high-energy lasers, the
information on the incoming laser threat is fed to the servo control system which either reorients the
high-energy laser precisely in the direction of the laser threat and neutralizes the source of radiation,
or illuminates a dummy target to divert the incoming threat from its intended course. Figure 15.20
illustrates a typical deployment scenario of an EOCM used as a decoy system for protection of high-
value assets such as aircraft shelters from laser-assisted threats.
Laser warning systems are available internationally covering a spectral response range from the
visible to the far-infrared, encompassing the entire range of battleﬁeld solid-state lasers typically
operating at 1064 nm and 1540 nm, mid-infrared operating in the 3–5 mm band and far-infrared lasers
operating in the 8–14 mm band. (Infrared countermeasures are discussed in the following section.)
Operational ranges of 8–10 km and angle-of-arrival measurement resolution up to a fraction of a degree
are available in commercial systems.
Laser warning sensors are used both as standalone devices as well as an integral part of larger EOCM
systems. An example of a standalone system is the helmet-mounted laser warning system that uses
multiple sensors to give full 360 coverage. One such system that uses four sensors has been patented in
USA. Laser threat warning devices with operational ranges up to 10 km covering a spectral range from
400 to 1800 nm are being introduced. There are systems with direction detection capability in the form of
predetermined sectors of 40–50 and also with very precision direction sensing accuracy approaching
better than a degree.
Some common laser warning sensor systems are AVITRONICS LWS-300 and Goodrich’s AN/AVR-2
series systems including AN/AVR-2, AN/AVR-2A and AN/AVR-2B systems. LWS-300 has a direction
sensing resolution of 15 and an operational band of 500–1800 nm and Goodrich’s AN/AVR-2A is a
passive laser warning system speciﬁcally designed for the protection of aircraft from laser designators,
range ﬁnders and beam riding missiles. The detection system provides full 360 azimuth and 45
elevation coverage.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

In the category of integrated EOCM equipment, there is a whole range of both application- and
platform-speciﬁc systems. It is not feasible to discuss every system here; instead, an overview of some of
the better-known EOCM systems is presented. Laser decoy systems Type-405 from GEC-Marconi and
DHY-322 (Figure 15.21) from CILAS are two anti-sensor systems designed and built to divert the laser-
guided munitions from their intended targets. The DHY-322 comprises a laser detection system and a
high-energy laser. The high-energy laser is mounted on a controlled turret. The laser detection system
detects the origin of the hostile laser radiation, deciphers its PRF code and then synchronizes the high-
energy laser to operate at the decoded PRF code. The high-energy laser radiation is then used to
illuminate a dummy spot where the incoming projectile cannot do any signiﬁcant damage. DHY-322 is
speciﬁcally designed to protect ships, strategic sites and other high-value assets.
The STINGRAY laser detection and countermeasures system from Lockheed Martin is another
EOCM system designed to protect the frontline forces by accurately locating the optical and electro-
optical ﬁre control systems of the enemy. The system is particularly designed for and is popular with
armoured ﬁghting platforms. Another state-of-the-art EOCM system similar in capabilities and
application potential to the STINGRAY system is the Russian SHTORA-1. SHTORA-1 has been
designed to protect the armoured ﬁghting platforms from laser-guided munitions, laser beam riders and
anti-tank guided missiles. It is equipped with an array of laser warning sensors, including coarse sensors
each having 135 azimuth coverage and ﬁne sensors each with 45 azimuth coverage. All sensors
provide elevation coverage of 5 to þ25. The system is also equipped with anti-laser anti-thermal
smoke grenades and active electro-optic jammers operating in the 0.7–2.7 mm band.
The other category of countermeasures system is the hard-kill systems, of which Russia’s ARENA and
Israel’s TROPHY are examples. ARENA is an active protection system (APS) designed to protect
armoured ﬁghting vehicles from anti-tank weapons including anti-tank guided missiles and missiles with
top-attack warheads. It uses a Doppler radar to detect incoming warheads and then ﬁres a defensive
rocket in the direction of the incoming threat, detonating near the approaching warhead and destroying it
before it hits the platform. TROPHY (Figure 15.22) is also an active protection system designed to
supplement the armour of both light- and heavy-armoured ﬁghting platforms. It intercepts the incoming
kinetic energy threats and destroys them by a shotgun-like blast.

15.3.4
Infrared Countermeasures
Infrared countermeasures (IRCM) are employed to protect aircraft from surface-to-air and air-to-air
heat-seeking missiles. The IRCM systems achieve this by confusing the infrared-guidance system of the
missiles and forcing them to deviate from their intended trajectory. The basic principle of operation of
infrared-guided missiles was described in Chapter 14 (Section 14.4.2.2). The infrared missile seeker
head uses either a spinning reticle and stationary optics called a spin scan or a stationary reticle and
rotating optics called a conical scan. In both cases, a modulated signal is generated which allows the
tracking logic to determine where the source of infrared energy is with respect to the direction of ﬂight of
the guided missile.
Infrared ﬂares deployed by the aircraft are a common form of infrared countermeasures. Flares create
infrared targets with a much stronger infrared signature than that from the engine of the aircraft and other
parts. The ﬂares mimic the target and force the missile to make an incorrect steering decision, which
leads to the missile breaking off a target lock-on. This further causes the missile to deviate from its
intended trajectory. State-of-the-art missiles are designed such that they are not deceived by ﬂares and
are be able to discriminate between real target and ﬂares. This has led to the development of active
infrared countermeasures.
Active IRCM systems use a modulated source of infrared radiation with a higher intensity than the
emission from the target. If this modulated radiation is seen by a missile seeker and if the modulation
scheme matches that used by the seeker of the target missile, the tracking logic of the missile confuses it
as coming from the target aircraft and generates a false tracking command. As a result of this, the missile
begins to deviate from the target, forcing the infrared seeker to go out of lock. Once the lock is broken, it
is very hard for the missile to regain locking condition. The aircraft to be protected could then use
infrared ﬂares to force the incoming infrared-guided missile to lock onto the ﬂare. The efﬁcacy of IRCM
system is determined by the ratio of jamming signal intensity J to the target signal intensity S and also on
how close the modulation frequencies are to the actual missile frequencies. The required J/S for spin scan
missiles is relatively much lower than for newer missiles.
Standard IRCM systems use incoherent and non-directional sources of infrared energy, usually
conﬁgured around infrared-emitting arc lamps, which suffer from the disadvantage that the probability of
the jamming signal penetrating the seeker head is low. Further, if the jamming signal is not effective
against a particular seeker system, the IRCM acts as a strong source of infrared energy, thereby
enhancing the ability of the missile to track the aircraft.
Figure 15.22
TROPHY active protection system (Courtesy of Rafael).
584
Lasers and Optoelectronics

This shortcoming is overcome by directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM), which integrate the
infrared source of jamming signal with a missile approach warning system. The infrared jammers are
mounted on a movable turret and operate in conjunction with the missile approach warning system.
When an infrared-guided missile such as MANPADS is ﬁred, it radiates electromagnetic energy in
different wavelength bands. Most DIRCM systems use ultraviolet sensors to detect the approach of the
missile, but detection in the infrared bands in addition to ultraviolet band has also been exploited. The
detection system provides a cue to the tracking system, which uses information from the detection
system to track the incoming missile. The infrared jammers direct the infrared jamming energy at the
seeker. The modulation scheme can be cycled to try to defeat a variety of seekers. The efﬁcacy of a
DIRCM depends on how comprehensively the approaching threat can be analyzed and how accurately it
can be tracked. Laser safety is another issue of concern if higher power needs to be employed in order to
defeat advanced missiles. Figure 15.23 illustrates the concept of a DIRCM system.
Some common examples of DIRCM systems include multispectral infrared countermeasures
(MUSIC) of Israel, BAE Systems’ AN/ALQ-212 advanced-threat infrared countermeasures (ATIRCM)
and Northrop Grumman’s GUARDIAN and common infrared countermeasures (CIRCM) programs.
ATIRCM is part of a directional infrared countermeasures suite and is ﬁelded on US Army CH-47
Chinook helicopters. The suite provides protection against all infrared threat bands and, with its one or
more infrared jamming heads, is capable of handling multiple missile attacks. MUSIC also uses active
lasers instead of ﬂares to provide protection to the aircraft against MANPADs. Northrop Grumman’s
GUARDIAN is a DIRCM system that uses ultraviolet sensors for the detection of an incoming missile
and a turret-mounted infrared jammer to direct infrared energy at the missile seeker head when cued by
the detection system. High-intensity arc lamps are used as a source of infrared energy in earlier versions,
while newer versions use laser-based jammers. Figure 15.24 depicts a GUARDIAN DIRCM pod ﬁtted
underneath the aircraft fuselage.
The CIRCM program (Figure 15.25) envisages use of ﬁbre coupling for the transport of laser energy to
the jam head. The ﬁbre-coupled approach enables the remote location of larger and more complex laser
components that would be very difﬁcult to mount on the jam head. CIRCMs jam-head interface supports
both direct-coupled as well as ﬁbre-coupled architectures.
15.4
Directed-energy Laser Weapons
One of the major areas of global interest for scientists and engineers today is that of directed-energy
weapons (DEW). Three major categories of directed-energy weapons are microwave-based DEWs,
laser-based DEWs and particle beam weapons, where the focus in this section is on laser-based DEW. A
directed-energy weapon system primarily uses directed energy in the form of a concentrated beam of
electromagnetic energy or atomic or subatomic particles in the targeted direction to cause intended
Figure 15.23
Concept of DIRCM system.

585

damage to the enemy’s equipment, facilities and personnel. The intended damage could be lethal or non-
lethal.
A microwave-based DEW system is designed to produce the equivalent of electromagnetic interfer-
ence to damage the enemy’s electronics systems. Due to concerns regarding unintended side-effects on
the host platform, it is usually preferred to put such weapons only on unmanned combat air vehicles
(UCAV). The use of high-power microwaves as a weapon to attack underground and deeply buried
targets that are resistant to high explosives is also under consideration. A particle beam weapon uses a
high-energy beam of atomic or subatomic particles to inﬂict the intended damage on the target by
disrupting its atomic and/or molecular structure.
At the core of laser-based DEW is a high-power laser that has enough power in the case of a CW laser
or sufﬁcient pulse energy in the case of pulsed laser to inﬂict physical damage on the target. Although the
lasers intended for already-established applications such as those discussed in Chapter 14 will continue

to improve as newer technologies evolve and develop, it is the use of lasers as weapons that is going to
rewrite the military balance in the next 15–20 years.
The introduction of laser-based directed-energy weapon systems is set to dramatically alter the war-
ﬁghting capabilities of nations by enabling the execution of missions that would be extremely complex if
not impossible to realize with conventional kinetic-energy weapons. These include ground-based laser
systems for disabling low Earth orbit satellites and destroying missiles, airborne laser systems for
destroying ballistic missiles and space-based laser systems for neutralizing of theatre and inter-
continental ballistic missiles. A large number of experiments with laser-based directed-energy weapons
to demonstrate these or similar capabilities have been carried out in different parts of the world. The
realizability of these weapons has been established beyond doubt and these weapons have been projected
by strategists as the weapons of the 21st century. Directed-energy weapons are described at length in this
section in terms of salient features, deployment potential, the constituents of a DEW system, different
types, international status and emerging trends.
15.4.1
Operational Advantages and Limitations
The primary advantages of laser-based DEWs include speed-of-light delivery, near-zero collateral
damage, multiple target engagement and rapid re-targeting capability, immunity to electromagnetic
interference and no inﬂuence of gravity. Deep magazine and low cost per shot are the other advantages.
Laser weapons engage targets at the speed of light with essentially no time of ﬂight as compared to
conventional kinetic energy weapons that require a ﬁnite travel time. As an example, one of the world’s
fastest cruise missiles BrahMos with a supersonic speed of 2.8–3 Mach would take about 5 min to reach
its target located at its maximum operational range of 300 km. On the other hand, when targeted by a
laser DEW, the same target would be hit in a millisecond.
Further, while the missile becomes destroyed during the mission, the laser weapon is re-usable. This
feature makes them particularly suitable for engaging fast-moving targets. The rapid re-targeting feature
of laser-based DEWs is attributed to their being powered by rechargeable chemical or electrical energy
stores; their multiple target engagement simply involves the re-pointing and re-focusing of the beam
directing optical system. The processes of generation and the transfer of lethal laser power to the target
are purely in the optical spectrum; they are therefore immune to any electromagnetic interference and
jamming. Laser pointing is practically without any inertia and a light bullet has no mass so is not
inﬂuenced by gravity. As a result, no mid-course correction is required.
Although the initial costs involved in development and fabrication of laser DEWs are relatively much
higher than for projectile weapon systems with similar applications, the operational costs in the case of
former are practically negligible as compared to those in the case of latter. This is due to the fact that
while conventional weapons are one-shot weapons, laser DEWs have unlimited magazine. The total
number of shots a laser can ﬁre is only limited either by the amount of chemical fuel for chemical lasers
or electrical power for solid-state and ﬁbre lasers. Projectile weapon systems, guided missiles in
particular, expend a lot of expensive hardware such as rocket motors, guidance systems, avionics,
seekers and airframes every time they are ﬁred. In the case of laser weapons, the cost of each laser ﬁring
is essentially the cost of the chemical fuel or the electrical power consumed. As an example, a fourth-
generation shoulder-ﬁred surface-to-air missile MANPADS of the type FIM-92 Stinger series costs
about US$ 40 000. This missile can be used against an aircraft on a single mission. A similar mission
from a land-based laser DEW system can be carried out with a 50–100 kW solid-state laser by ﬁring the
laser beam for a dwell time of about 5 s. Going by present-day technology level, this laser system would
draw about 400–500 kW of electrical power for a period of 5 s, which is same as the electrical power
consumed by a 100 W bulb in 7 hours.
Laser-based DEWs also have some limitations. Some of these include their line-of-sight dependence,
requirement of ﬁnite dwell time, problems due to atmospheric attenuation and turbulence and
ineffectiveness against hardened structures. Unlike projectile weapons that instantly destroy the target
upon impact, laser weapons require a minimum dwell time of the order 3–5 s to deposit sufﬁcient energy
for target destruction.
Military Applications: Directed-energy Laser Systems

Laser weapons require direct line-of-sight to engage a target. Their effectiveness is reduced or
neutralized by the presence of any object or structure in front of the target that cannot be burnt through.
The effectiveness of the laser weapon is adversely affected by the atmospheric conditions. The laser
beam suffers attenuation due to absorption and scattering by airborne particles and gas molecules,
deterioration of beam quality in the form of deformation of the laser beam wave front and an increase in
the laser beam spot size at the target. Laser weapons are not very effective against hardened structures;
equipment such as antennas, sensors and external fuel stores mounted on these structures can however be
targeted effectively.
15.4.2
Operational Scenario
The operational scenario of directed-energy laser weapons is broadly categorized as short- and medium-
rangetacticalmissionsandlong-rangestrategicmissions.Someoftheimportantapplicationareasoftactical
classlaserweapons includestand-off neutralization ofordnances such asmines; unexplodedordnancesand
improvised explosive devices (IEDs); ground-based defence against rockets, artillery and mortars (RAM);
ground-based capability to destroy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) of the adversary; airborne defence of
aircraft against man portable air defence systems (MANPADS) such as shoulder-ﬁred surface-to-air
missiles; and ship defence against manoeuvreing cruise missiles and tactical ballistic missiles.
Stand-off neutralization of ordnances requires laser power in the range 1–2 kW for operational ranges
up to 300 m. Solid-state or ﬁbre laser sources operating around 1.0 mm are used for the purpose.
AVENGER and ZEUS of the US and Israeli THOR are laser ordnance systems with comparable
speciﬁcations. Anti-UAV operations up to a range of 8–10 km require about 100 kW of laser power.
Operational ranges of 5–6 km are possible with 50 kW laser systems. Again the preferred lasers are solid-
state and ﬁbre lasers. COIL may also be used. For applications such as air defence against RAM targets,
rocket-propelled grenades (RPG), battleﬁeld missiles and laser-guided munitions, typically 100 kW of
laser power is needed for operational ranges of 5–10 km. The photograph in Figure 15.26 illustrates the
concept of a laser weapon for air-defence application.
Long-range strategic applications of laser-based DEW systems mainly include ballistic missile
defence, space control such as space-based lasers and anti-satellite applications. In all these applications,
operational ranges are generally in the range of hundreds to thousands of kilometres and required power
levels of the order 1–20 MW depending upon the actual mission. Space control applications such as anti-
satellite applications require relatively much higher power than that needed for ballistic missile defence.

15.4.3
Components of Directed-energy Weapon Systems
Unlike conventional military applications of laser systems such as laser rangeﬁnders and target
designators which primarily comprise a laser source of desired speciﬁcation, laser-based directed-
energy weapons are much more than a high-power laser source. Figure 15.27 shows the block schematic
arrangement representative of the different components of a laser DEW system and their interconnec-
tions. The subsystems other than the high-power laser source are required for the purpose of directing the
laser beam to the intended point on the target, keeping it there for the desired dwell time and producing
the desired value of ﬂuence on the target. Laser-based DEW essentially comprises two major
subsystems: the high-power laser source and the beam control system.
A high-power laser source generates a laser beam of the desired power level, beam quality and time
duration to be able to inﬂict the intended damage on the enemy target. Potential candidates for building
high-power laser sources include gas dynamic CO2 lasers, chemical lasers including HF/DF and
chemical oxy-iodine lasers, solid-state lasers and ﬁbre lasers. The ultimate quality desired of a potential
high-power laser source is its ability to produce as high a power density at the target for a given aperture
size as possible. Power density achievable for a given source and beam director combination is inversely
proportional to the square of wavelength and the beam quality parameter for given beam director
aperture size and operational range. Lower wavelength and a smaller value of beam quality parameter
therefore signiﬁes greater suitability as a high-power laser source. A smaller value of beam quality
parameter indicates higher beam quality, with unity being the ideal value. A shorter wavelength also has
better target coupling efﬁciency. In addition, power density at the target also depends upon atmospheric
losses. Other important factors include power scalability, operator safety and ease of mounting.
The primary function of the beam control system is to precisely point and focus the laser energy at the
designated point on the target and keep it there for sufﬁcient duration to cause intended damage to the
target. In addition to target tracking and beam pointing and focusing, the beam control system has many
other subsystems to perform different tasks which include beam shaping and beam stabilization and
wave front control for atmospheric correction.

Components of a laser-based DEW system.
Military Applications: Directed-energy Laser Systems
589

In addition to the laser source and beam pointing system, the propagation of the high-power laser beam
through the atmosphere and its coupling with the target, also called target lethality, are the other
important constituents determining the efﬁcacy of laser weapon.
The laser beam has to propagate over long atmospheric paths, and the resulting propagation effects
control the overall effective range or lethality range of the weapon system. Propagation effects include
diffraction, absorption and turbulence. The diffraction effect tends to spread out the laser energy as the
laser beam propagates; the amount of spreading is proportional to the wavelength to beam aperture
diameter ratio. This limits the smallest spot diameter to which the laser beam can be focused.
Scattering is due to atmospheric constituents and results in a loss of laser energy from the beam path in
other directions. Longer wavelengths have relatively lower scattering losses. Absorption by atmospheric
constituents also causes loss of energy, consequently decreasing the laser power reaching the target end.
There is a very strong dependence of absorption parameter on location, time of year and weather pattern.
Turbulence causes the beam to spread, resulting in an increase in laser spot size and reduction in power
density at the target end. Turbulence is measured by the C2
n parameter, which is a strong function of
altitude and wind speed and other atmospheric parameters. Thermal blooming is another parameter that
causes laser beam aberration. This arises out of heating effects produced by absorption leading to a
refractive index gradient in the laser beam path. This further leads to the formation of a negative lens and
causes the laser beam to spread. Thermal blooming effects can be ignored for rapidly moving target such
as airborne targets.
15.4.4
International Status
A large number of directed-energy laser weapon systems are presently reported to be under development
and up-gradation. Some are experimental, some are technology demonstrators and others are being
upgraded and ruggedized to become realistic battleﬁeld weapon systems in the near future. Some of the
more-talked-about systems are brieﬂy described in the following.
The short-range high-energy laser (HEL) mounted on a tracked vehicle for use as an air defence
system against low-ﬂying high-performance aircraft, missiles and attack helicopters is a laser-based
DEW system jointly developed by the two German companies Diehl and LFK. The system is conﬁgured
around a gas dynamic CO2 laser emitting at 10.6 mm and has associated target acquisition and tracking
sensors. The beam director uses a 1 m diameter focusing mirror mounted on an extendible arm for
delivery of a high-power laser beam to the target. Target damage is achieved by focusing the laser
radiation into a small diameter spot, producing very high energy density and causing the target material
to become successively heated, melted and vaporized. The system, which has been reported to be
successfully tested, has an operational range of 8 km.
TRW’s general area defence integrated anti-missile (GARDIAN) laser system is also a short-range
complement to surface-to-air missile defence designed to engage discrete ballistic threats at longer
ranges. The system generates a 400 kW laser beam, which is delivered through a 0.7 m beam pointer/
tracker. Depending upon weather conditions, the laser can destroy targets at altitudes from ground-
hugging heights up to 15 km. The system has a target acquisition and tracking system and, once locked,
the laser stays locked to the target until it is destroyed. The system can carry fuel for ﬁring 60 shots.
One of the very early directed-energy laser systems, a technology demonstrator, is TRW’s mid-
infrared advanced chemical laser (MIRACL). It is a 2.2 MW CW deuterium ﬂuoride laser with a
maximum lasing duration of 70 s. It uses a 1.8 m Sealite pointing and tracking device (Figure 15.28) . The
system was reported have undergone trials against different types of targets at the White Sands Missile
Range in New Mexico. In one of the tests conducted in 1996, a small fraction of laser power was used to
destroy a 122 mm short-range artillery rocket in ﬂight. The laser beam was locked to the target for 15 s.
The laser is also reported to have tested against sea-skimming missiles.
TRW have also developed the high-energy laser weapon system (HELWEPS), which is also a
chemical laser using ethylene, hydrogen and ﬂuorinated nitrogen as the active medium. The system is
based on their earlier experience gained from building MIRACL, and has an integral electro-optic
tracker.

Lasers and Optoelectronics

The chemical oxy-iodine laser (COIL) is in serious contention for use as a laser weapon, particularly
for operation from an aerial platform. The famous airborne laser (ABL) uses COIL and is conﬁgured on a
Boeing 747–400 freighter aircraft as shown in Figure 15.29. It is capable of destroying a ballistic missile
in boost phase. In operation, the aircraft patrols the friendly air space. If an enemy missile launch is
detected by a variety of sensors, this information is relayed to the aircraft conﬁgured as the high-power
laser system. The nose of the aircraft is ﬁtted with a 1.6 m beam director that focuses the high-power laser
radiation from a megawatt-class COIL onto the missile once it rises above the cloud cover. The intercept
range of ABL has been put at 200 km from its stand-off position. A performance evaluation of ABL
began in July 2002. In February 2010, the system was successfully used to destroy a ballistic missile. The

system was subsequently considered to be operationally unviable and the ABL program has been
reportedly shelved since December 2011.
The advanced tactical laser (ATL) uses an 80 kW COIL and is mounted on a Boeing C-130H Hercules
aircraft. It is intended to be used for covert activities such as setting ﬁres to vehicles, disabling
communication antennas, satellite and radar dishes and breaking electrical power lines. The ATL offers
the mobility of a small aircraft, the high-resolution imagery for target identiﬁcation and the ability to
localize damage to a small area of less than a foot in diameter from a range of 8–10 km.
Another well-known laser-based DEW system is the tactical high-energy laser (THEL) and its mobile
version M-THEL. The system uses a deuterium ﬂuoride (DF) laser operating at 3.8 mm. It is a tactical air
defence system against short-range rockets. The THEL demonstrator was successfully tested repeatedly
between 2000 and 2004, destroying a number of 122 mm and 160 mm Katyusha rockets, multiple
artillery shells and mortar rounds, including a salvo attack by mortar.
A space-based laser (SBL) is the ultimate objective of the US directed-energy laser program. A space-
based laser, designed to intercept ICBMs and other strategic and tactical missiles, is proposed to be
conﬁgured around a 20 MW hydrogen ﬂuoride (HF) laser operating at 2.7 mm. The system will be
deployed in a 800–1300 km orbit and will have an expected target engagement range of 4000–12 000 km.
Several directed-energy laser systems based on solid-state and ﬁbre lasers are being developed and
tested for tactical mission needs ranging from ordnance neutralization to anti-missile and anti-RAM
applications. Raytheon has developed and successfully tested a directed-energy laser system called Laser
Phalanx (Figure 15.30), employing a 20 kW industrial ﬁbre laser. The system has been successfully
demonstrated against a static mortar from a distance of 0.5 km. Raytheon has also successfully tested a
ship-mounted solid-state laser weapon called Laser Weapon System (LaWS) in the shooting of four
drones.
15.5
Summary
 Armed forces engaged in a low-intensity conﬂict operate with fewer soldiers, a reduced range of
tactical equipment and limited scope to operate in military manner. Use of artillery is also avoided in
the case of urban conﬂicts and use of air power is often restricted to surveillance and transportation of
personnel and equipment.
 The key advantage of the use of laser technology in low-intensity conﬂicts mainly stems from its near-
zero collateral damage, speed of light delivery and potential for building non-lethal weapons.
 Some of the well-established laser devices in LIC applications include: laser dazzlers for close combat
operations, mob/riot control and protection of critical infrastructures from aerial threats; lidar sensors

for detection of chemical, biological and explosive agents; femtosecond lasers for imaging of
concealed weapons; and lasers for sniper and gun ﬁre location identiﬁcation. The use of laser
vibrometry and electron speckle interferometry techniques for the detection of buried mines and high-
power lasers for disposal of unexploded ordnances are emerging applications of laser technology for
homeland security.
 Due to their acute toxicity, rapidity of action, indetectability by human senses and economic viability,
nerve agents (e.g. organophosphonate compounds) and blister agents (e.g. mustard compounds) are
the two potentially very harmful classes of chemical warfare agents.
 Lidar-based detection is the most practically realizable technique for the stand-off detection of
chemical and biological warfare agents. Commonly exploited physical phenomena forming the basis
of chemical and biological agent detection include elastic backscattering, laser-induced ﬂuorescence
and differential absorption.
 Ultraviolet laser-induced ﬂuorescence (UV-LIF) is used for the detection of biological molecules since
most ﬂuoresce when excited by ultraviolet radiation.
 The differential absorption technique known as DIAL uses two wavelengths: one corresponds to the
wavelength of peak absorption of the targeted molecule and the other corresponds to the weak
absorption of the targeted molecule. The ratio of the two received backscattered signals is a measure of
the concentration of the targeted chemical warfare agent.
 The stand-off detection of biological warfare agents is based on the concept of laser-induced
ﬂuorescence (LIF), which is the emission from atoms or molecules after they have been excited
to higher energy levels by another laser. The emission takes place at a wavelength that is higher than
the wavelength of laser light exciting it.
 Commonly used technologies for stand-off detection of explosives include laser-induced breakdown
spectroscopy (LIBS), Raman spectroscopy and its variants, LIF spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy.
These are all trace detection methods; bulk detection methods such as millimetre wave imaging and
terahertz spectroscopy are also available.
 LIBS focuses a high-energy laser beam on the trace sample to break down a small part of the sample
into a plasma of excited ions and atoms. The plasma emits light that is characteristic of emissions from
ionic, atomic and small molecular species. These light emissions are detected by a spectrometer to
identify the elemental composition.
 The basis of detection in the case of Raman spectroscopy is the shift in the wavelength caused by
inelastic Raman scattering by the target molecule. The inelastic scattering of impinging photons where
some energy is lost to (or gained from) the target molecule returns scattered light with a higher (or
lower) wavelength. The difference is dictated by the energy of vibrational modes of the target
molecule and therefore constitutes the ﬁngerprint or the basis of identiﬁcation. Complex mixtures are
identiﬁed using algorithms for pattern recognition.
 Almost all the laser-based stand-off detection methods have detection limits too high for them to be
suitable for the detection of explosives in ﬁeld conditions, which requires the capability to detect traces
in the vapour phase or in the form of particles. Another problem is insufﬁcient selectivity to identify a
target explosive in the presence of interferents.
 The electro-optical target locator’s functioning is based on the cat’s eye effect. The target optical
device is illuminated by a laser beam, returns a fraction of the beam as a retro-reﬂected beam and is
received by a sensitive receiver.
 Moderately high-power lasers are a very attractive choice for neutralization of unexploded ordnances.
The advantages their use include large magazine, high precision, controllable effects with reduced
collateral damage and ensured and fast disposal from safe stand-off ranges. Unexploded ordnance is
disposed of by focusing a high-power laser beam on the ordnance casing, thereby heating it until the
temperature of backplane of the casing exceeds the ignition temperature of explosive ﬁller, leading to a
low-level detonation. AVENGER, ZEUS and THOR are well-known laser ordnance neutralization
systems.
 Laser dazzlers are emerging internationally as a new non-lethal alternative for law enforcement,
homeland security, border patrol, coastal protection, infrastructure protection and host of other low-

593

intensity conﬂict scenarios. A laser dazzler emits a high-intensity laser beam in the visible band,
usually in the blue-green region, to temporarily impair the vision of the adversary without causing any
permanent or lasting injury to the subject’s eyes.
 The choice of laser dazzler performance parameters such as laser power, spot size at the target and
laser power density are dictated by the nature of deployment. The beam shaping and directing optics is
so designed to achieve the desired value of the nominal ocular hazard distance (NOHD) and a laser
power density that does not exceed the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) ﬁgure dictated by
ANSI for eye safety.
 Some of the well-known portable laser dazzler systems include the Compact High Power (CHP) laser
dazzler, GLARE MOUT, GLARE GBD-IIIC, GLARE LA-9/P, Sabre 203, JD-3 laser dazzler, ZM-87
portable laser disruptor, Photonic Disruptor (classiﬁed as TALI) and Dazer Laser.
 Electro-optic countermeasures are broadly classiﬁed as passive and active countermeasures. Passive
countermeasures for platform protection include use of armour, camouﬂage, fortiﬁcation and other
protection technologies such as a self-sealing fuel tank. In the case of active countermeasures, means
are adopted to counterattack the incoming threat. This may be achieved by neutralizing one of the
elements responsible for the functioning of the guided threat or by physically destroying the incoming
threat by launching a counter projectile in that direction.
 Active countermeasures comprise soft-kill and hard-kill countermeasures. Soft-kill countermeasures
change the electromagnetic, acoustic or other forms of signatures of the platform to be protected.
Hard-kill countermeasures physically destroy the incoming threat.
 A laser warning sensor system is an indispensable component of any EOCM system, whether designed
for soft-kill or hard-kill. It provides information on the type and direction of arrival of laser threats. A
laser warning system provides valuable information that enables the platform crew to decide on the
countermeasure system to be used. Some common laser warning sensor systems are AVITRONICS
LWS-300 and Goodrich’s AN/AVR-2 series systems.
 Laser decoy systems Type-405 from GEC-Marconi and DHY-322 from CILAS are two anti-sensor
systems designed and built to divert the laser-guided munitions from their intended targets.
 STINGRAY laser detection and countermeasures system from Lockheed Martin is an EOCM system
designed to protect the frontline forces by accurately locating the enemy’s optical and electro-optical
ﬁre control systems. Russian SHTORA-1 has been designed to protect the armoured ﬁghting platforms
from laser-guided munitions, laser beam riders and anti-tank guided missiles. Russian ARENA and
Israel’s TROPHY are common examples of active protection systems.
 Infrared countermeasures (IRCM) are employed to protect aircraft from surface-to-air and air-to-air
heat-seeking missiles. The IRCM systems achieve this by confusing the infrared guidance system of
the missiles and forcing them to deviate from their intended trajectory. Active IRCM systems use a
modulated source of infrared radiation with a higher intensity than the emission from the target. If this
modulated radiation matches that used by the seeker of the target missile, the tracking logic of the
missile generates a false tracking command, forcing the infrared seeker to go out of lock. Once the
lock is broken, it is very hard for the missile to regain locking condition.
 In the case of a directional infrared countermeasures (DIRCM) system, infrared jammers are mounted
on a movable turret and operate in conjunction with a missile approach warning system. Most DIRCM
systems use ultraviolet sensors to detect the approach of the missile. Detection in the infrared bands
have also been exploited. The detection system provides a cue to the tracking system, which uses
information from the detection system to track the incoming missile. The infrared jammers direct the
infrared jamming energy at the seeker. The modulation scheme can be cycled to try to defeat a variety
of seekers. Some common examples of DIRCM systems include MUSIC of Israel, BAE Systems’ AN/
ALQ-212 ATIRCM and Northrop Grumman’s GUARDIAN and CIRCM programs.
 The three major categories of directed-energy weapons are: microwave-based DEWs, laser-based
DEWs and particle beam weapons. A directed-energy weapon system primarily uses directed energy
in the form of a concentrated beam of electromagnetic energy or atomic or subatomic particles in the
targeted direction to cause intended damage to the enemy’s equipment, facilities and personnel. The
intended damage could be lethal or non-lethal.
594
Lasers and Optoelectronics

 The primary advantages of laser-based DEWs include speed-of-light delivery, near-zero collateral
damage, multiple target engagement and rapid re-targeting capability, immunity to electromagnetic
interference and no inﬂuence of gravity. Deep magazine and low cost per shot are the other
advantages.
 Laser-based DEWs suffer the limitations of line-of-sight dependence, requirement of ﬁnite dwell time,
problems due to atmospheric attenuation and turbulence and ineffectiveness against hardened
structures. Unlike projectile weapons that instantly destroy the target upon impact, laser weapons
require a minimum dwell time of the order 3–5 s to deposit sufﬁcient energy for target destruction.
 The operational scenario of directed-energy laser weapons is broadly categorized as short- and
medium-range tactical missions and long-range strategic missions. Some of the important application
areas of tactical class laser weapons include stand-off neutralization of ordnances such as mines
unexploded ordnances and IEDs; ground-based defence against RAM; ground-based capability to
destroy UAVof the adversary; airborne defence of aircraft against MANPADS such as shoulder-ﬁred
surface-to-air missiles; ship defence against manoeuvring cruise missiles; and tactical ballistic
missiles.
 Ballistic missile defence and anti-satellite applications are the common long-range strategic appli-
cations of laser weapons. Some of the well-known laser weapon technology demonstrators include
THEL, M-THEL, ATL, ABL, MIRACL, LaWS, PHALANX and SBL.

Laser Safety
A.1
Laser Damage
Due to their low beam divergence and resultant high intensity even after having travelled long distances,
lasers can be potentially dangerous to the eyes even at moderate power level and to the skin at relatively
higher power level. Lasers may cause permanent damage to the eye at moderate power levels of only a
few milliwatts due to the focusing action of the eye’s lens that concentrates the laser energy into an
extremely small spot on the retina. The damage to the photoreceptor cells of the retina is caused by the
transient rise in temperature at the focal spot.
Damage can result from both thermal and photochemical effects. Thermal damage occurs when
tissues are heated to the point of denaturation of proteins. In the case of photochemical damage, laser
light triggers chemical reactions in the tissues. Different laser wavelengths produce different pathologi-
cal effects. Photochemical damage mainly occurs with ultra-short-wavelength lasers emitting in the
ultraviolet and blue regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, while visible and infrared wavelengths are
harmful due to thermal damage. Table A.1 lists different wavelength ranges and the corresponding
pathological effects of them.
A.2
Maximum Permissible Exposure
Maximum permissible exposure (MPE) is the highest power or energy density of the light source
measured in W cm2 or J cm2, respectively, that is considered safe and has negligible probability of
causing any damage to the eyes. MPE is usually taken as 10% of the power or energy density that has
50% probability of causing damage under worst-case conditions.

Table A.3 Laser safety standard: revised system
Safety
class
Description
1
The accessible laser radiation is not dangerous under reasonable conditions of use. A class 1 laser is safe
under all conditions of normal use. This implies that while viewing a class 1 laser with the naked eye or
with typical magnifying optics such as a telescope or a microscope; the MPE limit cannot be exceeded.
1M
The accessible laser radiation is not hazardous, provided that no optical instruments are used which may,
for example, focus the radiation. A class 1M laser is safe for all conditions except when passed through
magnifying optics such as telescopes and microscopes. The classiﬁcation is applicable to lasers with
power level greater than the limit speciﬁed for class 1 lasers provided the laser energy entering the
pupil of the eye does not exceed the limits of class 1 lasers due to the large divergence of the laser.
2
The accessible laser radiation is limited to the visible spectral range (400–700 nm) and to 1 mW
accessible power. Due to the blink reﬂex action of the eye, it is not considered dangerous for limited
exposure up to 0.25 s.
2M
A class 2M laser is also safe because of the reﬂex action of the eye, with the additional restriction that it
is not viewed through optical instruments. As for class 1M lasers, the classiﬁcation is also applicable
to laser beams with power level >1 mW provided the beam divergence is large enough to prevent
laser energy passing through the pupil of the eye to exceed the limits of class 2 lasers.
3R
The accessible radiation may be dangerous for the eye, but can have at most 5 times the permissible
optical power of class 2 lasers emitting in visible spectrum and class 1 for other wavelengths. The
MPE can be exceeded with class 2M lasers with a low risk of injury.
3B
The accessible radiation may be dangerous for the eye and, under particular conditions, also for the skin.
Diffuse radiation scattered from a diffuse target is normally harmless. The accessible emission limit
is 500 mW for CW visible lasers emitting in visible spectrum and 30 mW for pulsed lasers. In the
case of direct viewing of class 3B lasers, protective eye wear is required.
4
The accessible radiation of a class 4 laser is very dangerous for the eye and for the skin. Light from
diffuse reﬂections and indirect viewing may be hazardous for the eye. Class 4 lasers must be
equipped with a key switch and have an in-built safety interlock. Most industrial, medical, scientiﬁc
and military lasers belong to this category.
Table A.2 Laser safety standard: old system
Safety
class
Description
I
A class I laser is safe and there is no possibility of eye damage. This can be either due to low output
power with no risk of eye damage after hours of exposure, or due to the laser being contained inside
an enclosure such as in the case of a compact disk player or laser printer.
II
This class refers only to lasers emitting in the visible spectrum with output power up to 1.0 mW. The
lasers are safe due to the blink action of the eye unless deliberately staring into the beam for an
extended period of time. Most laser pointers belong to this category.
IIa
For continuous exposure for a period of >1000 s, lasers at the low power end of the class II category
may produce retinal burn.
IIIa
Lasers with power level >1.0 mW and <5.0 mW and power density <2.5 mW cm2 belong to class IIIa.
These lasers are dangerous when used in combination with optical instruments and also dangerous to
the naked eye for direct viewing for more than 2.0 min.
IIIb
Lasers with power level 5.0–500 mW belong to Class IIIb. Direct viewing of these lasers may cause
damage to the eye. A diffuse reﬂection is generally not hazardous but both direct viewing and
specular reﬂection are equally dangerous. Class IIIb lasers, which are towards the high power end,
may present a ﬁre hazard or cause skin burn.
IV
Lasers belonging to class IV have power levels >500 mW. Class IV lasers can cause permanent eye
damage or skin burn even when used without optical instrumentation. Diffuse reﬂection from these
lasers can also be hazardous to eyes or skin within the nominal ocular hazard zone. Many industrial,
medical, scientiﬁc and military lasers are of the class IV category.

Appendix A

A.3
Nominal Hazard Zone
Determining the required safety measures based on safety classiﬁcation of the laser may not always be
correct as it does not take into consideration the effect of beam divergence. A strongly focused laser
beam can be so divergent that within a moderate distance after the focus, the intensity falls below the

Notes:
1. To calculate MPE for l ¼ 0.180–0.400 mm, use the J cm2 or W cm2 value or 0.56  t0.25 (whichever is lowest).
2. For multiple pulses for l ¼ 0.400–1.400 mm, apply the correction factor CP given in Table A.6.
3. For MPE for diffuse reﬂections for l ¼ 0.400–1.400mm, multiply the corresponding MPEs by correction factor CE
given in Table A.6.
4. For correction factors CA, CB and T1, see Table A.6.

MPE level for the eye. Nominal hazard zone is deﬁned as the zone within which safe exposure level may
be exceeded.
A.4
Safety Classiﬁcation
Based on how hazardous a given laser can be to the designers, operators and users of the device, it is
assigned a safety class. The classiﬁcation is based on the concept of accessible emission limit (AEL),
which is deﬁned for each of the laser classes. There are two classiﬁcation systems: the American system
which was in use until 2002 and the revised system which is part of the IEC 60825 standard and has been
included in the ANSI Z136.1 laser safety standard of the US since 2007. The former designates safety
class using Roman numerals in the US and Arabic numerals in the EU; the revised system uses Arabic
numerals in all jurisdictions. In both old and revised classiﬁcations, lasers are classiﬁed into four main
classes and a few subclasses in terms of maximum output power for different wavelength ranges. Salient
features of laser safety classiﬁcations in the old and revised systems are listed in Tables A.2 and A.3
respectively.
