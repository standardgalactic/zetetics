MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
Abstract. We give an informal exposition of pushforwards and orienta-
tions in generalized cohomology theories in the language of spectra. The
whole note can be seen as an attempt at convincing the reader that Todd
classes in Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch type formulas are not
Devil’s appearances but rather that things just go in the most natural pos-
sible way.

main goal of this paper is to try to convince the reader that there is actually
no mystery here, and that on the contrary the speciﬁc correction factor td(X)
is precisely what one should have expected from the very beginning. We will
try to achieve this within an informal exposition of the theory of pushforwards
and orientations in cohomology, with an emphasis on categorical features of
the category of spectra coming into play.
We make no claim of originality. Everything we write can be found elsewhere,
and plenty of references will be given throughout the text. We owe most of
our gratitude for the inspiration to Ando, Blumberg and Gepner and their
paper [ABG10], to Panin and Smirnov for their [PS02] and [Pan02], and of
course to Quillen [Qui71]. We have also blatantly stolen from Lurie’s [Lur09b]

We wish to reassure the reader that, although at the very beginning we will
be mentioning that the category of spectra is a symmetric monoidal stable ∞-
category in the sense Lurie’s Higher Algebra [Lur12], no advanced knowledge
of ∞-category theory is actually required to read this note as we will treat the
higher categorical aspects of spectra only very intuitively and we will be mostly
working in the homotopy category of spectra, which is an ordinary category
(i.e., a 1-category).

2. Introitus
We will be working in the stable ∞-category Sp of spectra. We reassure the
reader possibly unfamiliar both with spectra and/or with ∞-categories (stable
or not) that a previous knowledge of these may be useful but not necessary at
all. A good motto to keep in mind is the following informal analogy: spectra
are to spaces as real numbers are to rational numbers. By this we do not only
mean that spectra are certain sequences of (nice) topological spaces just like
real numbers are (equivalence classes of) certain sequences of rational numbers,
but also –and this is the main content of the motto– that one actually works
with spectra by knowing the categorical features of the category they form
and its relations to the category of topological spaces, more than with their
actual deﬁnition entailing these features. In terms of the analogy, this is to say
that R can be deﬁned as a suitable quotient of the set of Cauchy sequences of
rational numbers, but what one generally uses when working with real numbers
is not this deﬁnition but the properties it implies: e.g., that R is a complete
ordered ﬁeld. This is actually a complete deﬁnition of R: a complete ordered
ﬁeld, if it exists, is unique and contains Q. From this point of view, the whole
business of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences can be seen as a proof of
the existence of a ﬁeld with the completeness and ordering properties. Turning
back to spectra, we are saying that the only point we are asking the reader
to trust us on is that there exists a category Sp having the properties we will
attribute to it.

Actually, Sp will not be an ordinary category, but an (∞, 1)-category. We
address the interested reader to [Lur09a] for a comprehensive treatment, and
here content us with saying that for two given objects X and Y in Sp, we
don’t have just a set of morphisms, but a whole space of morphisms Sp(X, Y )
between X and Y . This allows us to say not only that two morphisms are
possibly equal, but that they are possibly homotopic (i.e., they lie in the same
connected component of Sp(X, Y )), or to talk of homotopies between homo-
topies between morphisms, and so on. Also, commutative diagrams of spectra
will not be strictly commutative, but always commutative up to some given
homotopy, which is part of the data deﬁning a commutative diagram in an
∞-category.
Remark 2.1. Calling the objects of Sp “0-morphisms”, the elements in Sp(X, Y )
“1-morphisms, the homotopies between 1-morphisms “2-morphisms” and so on,
one sees that in Sp one has k-morphisms for every k ≥0. This motivates the
terminology ∞-category. Moreover, since every homotopy is invertible up to a
homotopy between homotopies, one sees that for k > 1 every k-morphism in
Sp is invertible up to (k + 1)-morphisms. One indicates that 1 is the threshold
for invertibility by saying that the ∞-category Sp is an (∞, 1)-category.
Taking connected components of the hom-spaces one gets the homotopy
category of spectra, usually denoted by hSp. As a matter of notation, hom-
sets in the category hSp will be denoted by [−, −] rather than by hSp(−, −),
that is one writes
[X, Y ] := π0Sp(X, Y ),
for any X, Y in Sp. For a morphism f : X →Y in Sp, we will write
f∗: Sp(Y, Z) →Sp(X, Z)
and
f∗: Sp(T, X) →Sp(T, Y )
for the continuous maps between hom-spaces induced by precompostion and
postcomposition with f, respectively. We will use the same symbols to denote
the induced maps between hom-sets in hSp.
Remark 2.2. Even by the few informal lines above, one should deduce that ∞-
categories are a nice context for doing homotopical constructions. In classical
category theory, such a context is provided by the notion of a model structure
on a category. Starting with a model structure on an ordinary category is
indeed one of the most powerful ways to produce a rigorously deﬁned (∞, 1)-
category.
In these cases one says that the (∞, 1)-category is presented by
the model structure. For instance, a rigorous deﬁnition of the (∞, 1)-category
of spectra we are talking about is as the (∞, 1)-category presented by the
standard model structure on the (ordinary) category of orthogonal spectra
[MMSS01].

Other two (∞, 1)-categories we will meet in this note are the ∞-category
Top of (nice) topological spaces, presented by the classical (or Quillen) model
structure, and whose homotopy category hTop is the usual homotopy category
of (nice) topological spaces, and its pointed version Top∗. The ∞-categories
Top, Top∗and Sp are related by the functors (or, better, ∞-functors)
Top
Top∗
(−)+
,
and
Top∗
Sp
Σ∞
,
where (−)+ : Top →Top∗is the functor adjoining a free basepoint, i.e., X+ :=
X ⊔∗, and Σ∞: Top∗→Sp is the inﬁnite suspension, mapping a pointed space
Y to the spectrum given by sequence of pointed spaces Σ∞Y recursively deﬁned
by (Σ∞Y )0 = Y and (Σ∞Y )n+1 = Σ((Σ∞Y )n) for any n > 0. The morphisms
Σ((Σ∞Y )n) →(Σ∞Y )n+1 giving Σ∞Y the structure of a (sequential) spectrum
are the identities.
We will always look at (nice) topological spaces and pointed (nice) topolog-
ical spaces as spectra via the sequence of functors
Top
Top∗
Sp
(−)+
Σ∞
,
that is, given a space X, we will denote by the same symbol X its stabiliza-
tion, i.e., the spectrum Σ∞
+ X, and similarly for pointed spaces. As a notable
exception to this rule, when X is the space ∗consisting of a single point, we
will use the classical notation S to denote the spectrum Σ∞
+ ∗.
It should be remarked that stabilization is not an embedding: by stabilising
one loses all the unstable information about a space X. Nevertheless, as we
will only be concerned with stable aspects, no confusion should arise in this
note, and we’ll ﬁnd it an extremely convenient notation to denote by the same
symbol both a space and its stabilization.
Remark 2.3. By deﬁnition, the spectrum S has S0 = ∗+ = ∗⊔∗= S0 and so,
inductively, Sn = Sn for any n ≥0. It is called the sphere spectrum.
Remark 2.4. In an (∞, 1)-category, all universal properties are given “up to
homotopy” (with the homotopies being part of the universal property). For
instance, in an ordinary category C the property of an object ∅of being initial is
the fact that the hom-set C(∅, X) is a singleton for every object X in C. In the
(∞, 1)-categorical setting this is translated into requiring that the hom-space
C(∅, X) is “a singleton up to homotopy”, i.e., into the requirement that C(∅, X)
is contractible. This means that there is not a unique initial morphism, but
that the initial morphism is unique up to homotopies that are in turn unique
up to higher homotopies, and so on. With this in mind, one continues to talk
of “the” initial morphism ∅→X.
Similarly, the universal property of the
pullback, declined into an (∞, 1)-categorical setting, becomes the fact that the

6
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
commutative diagram
C(T, X ×Z Y )
C(T, X)
C(T, Y )
C(T, Z)
is a homotopy pullback of topological spaces for every T in C. We refer the
reader to [Doe98] for an introduction to homotopical pullbacks and pushouts
in the category of (nice) topological spaces.
By saying that the ∞-category of spectra is stable one means it satisﬁes two
very simple axioms (see [Lur12] for a comprehensive account):
(1) it has a zero object 0, i.e., an object that is at the same time initial
and terminal;
(2) it has pullbacks and pushouts, and every pullback is a pushout, and
vice versa.
Remark 2.5. Since pullback and pushout diagrams coincide in a stable (∞, 1)-
category, one sometimes calls them “pullout” diagrams. Pullout diagrams of
the form
X
Y
0
Z
f
g
are called ﬁber/coﬁber sequences. In this case, one says that X is the ﬁber of
g and Z is the coﬁber of g.
Remark 2.6. One uses a special notation to denote the ﬁber of the initial
morphism 0 →X and the coﬁber of the terminal morphism X →0. Namely
one denotes them by the symbols X[−1] and X[1], respectively, so that one
has the following deﬁning pullout diagrams for these:
X[−1]
0
0
X
;
X
0
0
X[1]
.
Comparison of the two pullout diagrams above immediately shows that in a
stable (∞, 1)-category C the shifts
[1], [−1]: C →C
are autoequivalences of C inverse to each other. One calls [1] the shift functor
and, for any n ∈Z one writes [n] for [1]n.
Remark 2.7. The reader used to the language of triangulated categories will
have found this sketchy description of stable ∞-categories echoing something
familiar. And indeed the homotopy category hC of a stable (∞, 1)-category
carries a natural structure of a triangulated category, where distinguished tri-
angles are the image in hC of ﬁber/coﬁber sequences in C and where the shift
functor is induced by the shift functor of C.
It is a nice exercise to show

AN EXPOSITION OF GHRR/2 THM IN THE FANCY LANGUAGE OF SPECTRA
7
that the two simple axioms of stable (∞, 1)-category imply the somehow less
transparent “octahedral axiom” of triangulated categories.
Remark 2.8. The shift functor in the (∞, 1)-category of spectra is induced
by the suspension functor on pointed topological spaces. By this reason it is
commonly denoted as X 7→ΣX in algebraic topology textbooks. Here we
prefer denoting it by X 7→X[1] to stress that it is the shift functor. Since
[1] and [−1] are inverse autoequivalences of C, one has a natural homotopy
equivalence Sp(X[1], Y ) ∼= Sp(X, Y [−1]) for any X, Y in Sp. The identiﬁcation
of [1] with the suspension functor then identiﬁes the negative shift Y 7→Y [−1]
with the loop space functor.
Remark 2.9. As in every stable ∞-category, the hom-sets [X, Y ] in the homo-
topy category hSp have a natural structure of abelian groups. Namely, since
0 is the zero object, we have natural homotopy equivalences Sp(X, 0) ∼= ∗and
so, by deﬁnition of the negative shift functor, the hom-space Sp(X, Y [−1]) is
deﬁned by the homotopy pullback
Sp(X, Y [−1])
0
0
Sp(X, Y )
.
This gives a natural identiﬁcation of Sp(X, Y [−1]) with the loop space ΩSp(X, Y )
based at the zero morphism X →Y , i.e., at the morphism X →0 →Y . It-
erating this, one gets an identiﬁcation Sp(X, Y [−n]) ∼= ΩnSp(X, Y ) for every
n ≥1. In particular, by using Y ∼= Y [2][−2], this gives the the natural identi-
ﬁcation
[X, Y ] = π0Sp(X, Y ) = π0Ω2Sp(X, Y [2]) = π2Sp(X, Y [2]).
Deﬁnition 2.10. Let X be a spectrum. For any n ∈Z, one writes
πSp
n (X) := [S[n], X]
and calls the abelian group πSp
n (X) the n-th homotopy group of X.
Remark 2.11. Notice that if X is a pointed space seen as a spectrum, then for
n ≥0, the homotopy group πSp
n (X) is not the n-th homotopy group of X: it
is the n-th stable homotopy group of X.
Another remarkable feature of the ∞-category of spectra is that it is sym-
metric monoidal with the smash product as tensor product and the sphere
spectrum S as unit object. Following [Lur10] we will denote the smash prod-
uct of spectra with the symbol ⊗rather than with the usual ∧to stress it
is the monoidal product. Similarly, we will use ⊕instead of ∨to denote the
coproduct of spectra. Also Top and Top∗are symmetric monoidal, with tensor
product given by the Cartesian product and by the smash product, respectively.
Moreover, both (−)+ : Top →Top∗and Σ∞: Top∗→Sp are monoidal func-
tors [MMSS01]. This fact has an immediate important consequence: spaces are

8
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
special objects within spectra with respect to the monoidal structure. Namely,
every object in Top is a coassociative cocommutative comonoid via the diag-
onal morphism ∆: X →X × X and the terminal morphism X →∗. Since
Σ∞
+ is symmetric monoidal we have that a space X, seen as a spectrum, comes
with natural distinguished morphisms
∆: X →X ⊗X
ϵ: X →S
making it a coassociative cocommutative comonoid in Sp.
Remark 2.12. Tensor product of spectra is compatible with the shift functor:
one has natural isomorphisms
X ⊗(Y [1]) ∼= (X ⊗Y )[1] ∼= (X[1]) ⊗Y.
These identify the shift functor with the tensor product with the object S[1].
Deﬁnition 2.13. Algebra objects (or monoids) in Sp, i.e., spectra E endowed
with morphisms
m: E ⊗E →E
e: S →E
satisfying the usual unit and associativity conditions will be called ring spectra.
If, moreover, the multiplication is commutative (up to coherent homotopies)
they will be called commutative ring spectra or E∞-ring spectra.
Remark 2.14. Since shift commutes with tensor product, if E is a ring spectrum
then E[k] is an E-module for any k ∈Z.
As in every monoidal category, if X is a comonoid and E is a monoid, then
[X, E] is a monoid with multiplication given by the composition
[X, E] ⊗[X, E]
[X ⊗X, E ⊗E]
[X, E]
⊗
(∆∗,m∗)
As this multiplication is compatible with the abelian group structure on [X, E],
when X is a comonoid and E is a monoid the hom-set [X, E] has a canonical
ring structure, which is commutative if both E is commutative and X is co-
commutative. So, in particular, if X is a space and E is an E∞-ring spectrum,
then [X, E] is a commutative ring.
Remark 2.15. Thanks to the compatibility of the shift functor with the tensor
product, if X is a space then the direct sum
M
n∈Z
[X, E[n]]
has a natural structure of graded commutative ring. This is called the graded
E-cohomology ring of X.

Remark 2.16. If ψ: E →F is a morphism of E∞-ring spectra, then
ψ∗: [X, E] →[X, F]
is a homomorphism of rings, for any comonoid X. Dually, if φ: X →Y is a
morphism of comonoids, then
φ∗: [Y, E] →[X, E]
is a homomorphism of rings, for any E∞-ring spectrum E. In particular, since
any continuous map of (nice) topological spaces is a comonoid map with respect
to the comultiplication given by the diagonal embedding, any continuous map
between spaces induces a pullback ring homomorphism φ∗: [Y, E] →[X, E].
As a special case of this, by taking the terminal morphism we see that for any
space X the ring [X, E] comes with a natural ring homomorphism
πSp
0 (E) = [S, E] →[X, E],
making [X, E] a πSp
0 (E)-algebra. One says that πSp
0 (E) is the ring of coeﬃcients
for the multiplicative cohomology theory deﬁned by the E∞-ring spectrum E.
Example 2.17. Let A be an abelian ring. If E = HA, the Eilenberg–Mac Lane
E∞-ring spectrum deﬁning singular cohomology with coeﬃcients in A, one has
πSp
0 (HA) = A, so that the coeﬃcients of singular cohomology are indeed the
coeﬃcients in the sense of Remark 2.16.
Remark 2.18. Since shift commutes with tensor product, if X is a comonoid
in Sp and Y is a comodule over X, i.e., we have a morphism
ρ: Y →X ⊗Y
making the obvious diagrams commute, then for any n ∈Z also Y [n] is a X-
comodule. In particular, for any n the hom-set [Y [n], E] is an [X, E]-module
via the [X, E]-action
[X, E] ⊗[Y [n], E]
[X ⊗Y [n], E ⊗E]
[Y [n], E].
⊗
(ρ[n]∗,m∗)
A particular instance of this construction is obtained by taking X = S and
ρ: Y
∼
−→S ⊗Y the natural isomorphism, for any spectrum Y . This way, one
sees that [Y [n], E] is a [S, E]-module, i.e., a πSp
0 (E)-module, for any n ∈Z. In
particular, if Y is a space, this module structure coincides with the one induced
by the ring homomorphism πSp
0 (E) →[Y, E] described in Remark 2.16.
Remark 2.19. If X and Y are two (nice) topological spaces and E is an E∞-ring
spectrum, then the commutative diagram of spaces
X × Y
X
Y
∗

10
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
induces the commutative diagram of commutative rings
[X ⊗Y, E]
[X, E]
[Y, E]
[S, E]
and so, by the universal property of the tensor product of commutative rings,
a morphism of rings
⊗E : [X, E] ⊗πSp
0 (E) [Y, E] →[X ⊗Y, E].
One sees that ⊗E is induced by the external multiplication
[X, E] ⊗[Y, E]
[X ⊗Y, E ⊗E]
[X ⊗Y, E],
⊗
m∗
by factoring the latter through [X, E] ⊗[Y, E] →[X, E] ⊗πSp
0 (E) [Y, E].
Deﬁnition 2.20. We will say that the E∞-ring spectrum E is periodic of
period k or simply k-periodic if we are given an isomorphism of E-modules
φ : E →E[−k]. The composition
βE : S →E
φ−→E[−k]
is called the Bott element of the k-periodic E∞-ring spectrum (E, φ).
Remark 2.21. At the level of homotopy classes, the Bott element βE is an
element in πSp
k (E).
Remark 2.22. Since φ is an isomorphism, the Bott element is invertible: there
exists an element β−1
E : S →E[k] with βEβ−1
E
= β−1
E βE = e: S →E. For
any spectrum X, the multiplication by the Bott element induces a natu-
ral isomorphism of abelian groups [X, E]
βE·
−−→[X[k], E].
In particular, the
choice of an element ξ ∈[X[−k], E] is equivalent to the choice of an ele-
ment βEξ ∈[X, E] via the periodicity isomorphisms. If X is a space, by the
universal property of polynomial rings the latter are in bijection with ring
homomorphisms πSp
0 (E)[u] →[X, E] extending the canonical homomorphism
ϵ∗: [S, E] →[X, E], via the association u 7→βEξ.
Remark 2.23. If (E, φ) is a k-periodic E∞-ring spectrum, then the isomorphism
φ is the multiplication by the Bott element, i.e., φ is the composition
E ∼= E ⊗S
E ⊗E[k] ∼= (E ⊗E)[−k]
E[−k].
id⊗β
m[−k]
Therefore, one can equivalently deﬁne a k-periodic E∞-ring spectrum as an
E∞-ring spectrum endowed with a morphism βE : S[k] →E such that multi-
plication by βE induces an isomorphism of E-modules E →E[−k].
Deﬁnition 2.24. An E∞-ring spectrum E is called even 2-periodic if it is
2-periodic and πSp
2k+1(E) = 0, ∀k ∈Z.

Example 2.25. The ﬁrst and most natural example of an even 2-periodic coho-
mology theory is complex K-theory KU. The Bott element βKU ∈πSp
2 (KU) =
K0(S2) can be identiﬁed with (the class of the) virtual line bundle 1C −L−1 in
the K-theory of S2, where L = OP1C(1) is the universal complex line bundle
over the complex projective line P1C ∼= S2 and 1C is the trivial rank 1 complex
vector bundle S2 × C →S2.
Another even 2-periodic cohomology theory we will come back to later is
even 2-periodic rational singular cohomology HPevQ := L
i∈Z HQ[2i]. Here,
as usual, HQ denotes the Eilenberg-Mac Lane spectrum of the abelian group
(Q, +), so that [X, HQ[2i]] = H2i(X; Q) for any (nice) topological space X.
Its homotopy groups are given by
πSp
i (HQ) =



Q if i = 0
0 otherwise.
The Bott element βHPevQ of HPevQ can be identiﬁed with 1 ∈πSp
0 (HQ) via
πSp
2 (HPevQ) =
Y
i∈Z
πSp
2−2i(HQ)βi = πSp
0 (HQ)β = Qβ,
where β is a degree −2 formal variable used to keep track of the degree shiftings.
In other words, the Bott element βHPevQ of HPevQ is naturally identiﬁed with
the formal variable β used in forming the even 2-periodic rational singular
cohomology of a space X:
HP k
ev(X; Q) =
M
i∈Z
Hk+2i(X; Q)βi.
Equivalently, the Bott element βHPevQ is the fundamental class of S2 via
πSp
2 (HPevQ) =
Y
i∈Z
πSp
2 (HQ[2i]) = πSp
2 (HQ[2]) = Qβ.
Notice that at the level of πSp
2 ’s, the Chern character ch: KU →HPevQ gives
πSp
2 (ch): πSp
2 (KU) →πSp
2 (HPevQ) mapping 1C−L−1 to 1−eβc1(L−1) = βc1(L).
As the ﬁrst Chern class of the universal line bundle on P1C represents the
fundamental class of P1C in singular cohomology (with Z- and so also) with
Q-coeﬃcients, we see that the Chern character maps the Bott element of KU
to the Bott element of HPevQ.
We will also be prominently considering the category VectBunR of real vector
bundles over (nice) topological spaces, whose objects are vector bundles V →
X and whose morphisms are commutative diagrams
V

where ˜f is ﬁbrewise linear. The category VectBunR is symmetric monoidal
with monoidal product given by (V →X)⊗(W →Y ) = (V ⊞W →(X ×Y )),

where (V ⊞W)(x,y) = Vx ⊕Wy, and unit object the zero vector bundle over
the point.
Notation 2.26. With K-theory in mind, in what follows we will usually denote
the direct sum of vector spaces and of vector bundles by + instead than by ⊕.
Deﬁnition 2.27. The Thom space Th(V →X) of a real vector bundle V →X
is deﬁned as the homotopy pushout
V \ X
V
∗
Th(V →X)
f
where V \ X denotes the total space of the vector bundle V minus the copy of
X inside it given by the zero section.
Notice that, by its very deﬁnition, Th(V →X) is a pointed space. The base-
point of Th(V →X) is customary denoted by ∞: it is the “point at inﬁnity”
of the total space of the vector bundle V →X in the “vertical directions”.
Remark 2.28. A more concrete description of the Thom space Th(V →X) is
obtained as follows. In order to compute the homotopy pushout deﬁning it,
one replaces the inclusion V \X ,→V with the homotopy equivalent coﬁbration
V \B(V ) ,→V , where B(V ) is the open unit disk bundle of V for some chosen
Riemannian metric. By retracting on the closed unit disk bundle, this is in
turn equivalent to the coﬁbration S(V ) ,→D(V ), where S(V ) denotes the unit
sphere bundle and D(V ) the closed unit disk bundle of V , respectively. The
Thom space of V is then realized as the quotient space D(V )/S(V ), with base
point the equivalence class S(V ). One sees from this description that when
the base space X of the vector bundle V →X is compact, the Thom space
Th(V →X) reduces to the one-point compactiﬁcation of the total space V ,
pointed at the point at inﬁnity.
Remark 2.29. The Thom space construction,
Th: VectBunR →Top∗
is a symmetric monoidal functor: one has a natural isomorphism
Th(V ⊞W →(X × Y )) ∼= Th(V →X) ∧Th(W →Y ).
The above remark immediately leads to the following
Deﬁnition 2.30. The Thom spectrum functor (V →X) 7→XV is the sym-
metric monoidal functor VectBunR →Sp given by the composition
VectBunR
Top∗
Sp
Th
Σ∞
.
Example 2.31. If V is the rank zero vector bundle 0 = X × R0 →X, then
V \ X = ∅and so Th(0 →X) = X+. This implies X0 = X, where as usual
on the right hand side we are writing X for the suspension spectrum Σ∞
+ X.

13
Another simple example is the following. As Th(R →∗) = (S1, ∞) = Σ+(∗),
we have ∗R = S[1].
Remark 2.32. In the categorical spirit of this note, the actual deﬁnition of
the Thom spectrum functor is less important than its properties. What the
reader should keep in mind is that to a real vector bundle V →X is associated
a spectrum XV in such a way that (X × Y )V ⊞W ∼= XV ⊗Y W , and that
∗R = S[1]. For instance, from these two properties one derives
XV +1 = (X × {∗})V ⊞1 = XV ⊗S[1] = XV [1],
where we have written 1 for the trivial rank 1 vector bundle 1 := X × R →X.
More generally, writing n := X × Rn →X for the trivial rank n bundle, one
has XV +n = XV [n] for any nonnegative n.
The other categorical property of Thom spectra that we will need is that
Thom spectra are comodules over their bases: for every (nice) topological space
X and every vector bundle V →X the Thom spectrum XV has a canonical
X-comodule structure
∆V : XV →X ⊗XV .
This is simply obtained by applying the Thom spectrum functor to the mor-
phism in VectBunR given by the commutative diagram
V
0 ⊞V
X
X × X
(0,idV )
∆
,
where ∆: X →X×X is the diagonal embedding. This construction is natural:
if (f, ˜f): (V →X) →(W →Y ) is a morphism in VectBunR,then we have a
commutative diagram
XV
X ⊗XV
Y W
Y ⊗Y W
∆V
fV
f⊗fV
∆V
In other words, the construction of Thom spectra gives a functor
VectBunR →Comod(Sp)
(V →X) 7→(X, XV ),
where for any monoidal category C we denote by Comod(C) the category whose
objects are pairs (A, M), where A is a coalgebra object in C and M is an A-
comodule, and morphisms from (A, M) to (B, N) are commutative diagrams
M
A ⊗M
N
B ⊗N
∆M
ˆf
f⊗ˆf
∆N
where f : A →B is a morphism of coalgebras.
This gives a natural [X, E]-module structure on the E-cohomology of XV .

14
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
Remark 2.33. If f : X →Y is a morphism of (nice) topological spaces and V
is a vector bundle on Y we have a naturally induced morphism
(f, fV ): (X, Xf∗V ) →(Y, Y V )
in Comod(Sp). In particular, given two vector bundles V and W over a space
X, we have a natural morphism
(∆, ∆V ⊞W ): (X, XV +W ) →(X ⊗X, XV ⊗XW )
as a consequence of the pullback isomorphism V + W = ∆∗(V ⊞W), where
∆: X →X × X is the diagonal embedding.
Remark 2.34. The category VectBunR has a positive shift given by tensoring
with the trivial rank 1 line bundle R →∗. As we have seen in Remark 2.32,
the Thom spectrum functor changes the positive shift on VectBunR into the
shift functor on Sp. As a consequence, we have a well deﬁned notion of Thom
spectrum of a virtual bundle V = V0 −V1 on X, given by XV = XV0+ ˜V1[−n],
where ˜V1 is a vector bundle on X such that V1 + ˜V1 is the trivial rank n vector
bundle, for some n. As a shifted comodule is again a comodule, we see that
XV is naturally an X-comodule for any virtual vector bundle V on X.
Example 2.35. Let X be a compact smooth manifold, and let i: X ,→Rn be
an embedding. If ν denotes the normal bundle to X in Rn, then TX +ν is the
trivial rank n vector bundle over X, so that X−TX = Xν[−n]. By considering
Rn inside its one-point compactiﬁcation Sn, one can look at i as an embedding
i: X ,→Sn. A tubular neighborhood U of X in Sn is homeomorphic to the
open unit disk bundle B(ν) of the normal bundle ν. Mapping all points of Sn
outside U to the point at inﬁnity in the Thom space of ν while keeping the
points of U ﬁxed deﬁnes a map of pointed spaces Sn →Th(ν). Applying Σ∞,
this deﬁnes a map of spectra S[n] →Xν and so, equivalently, a map of spectra
γPT : S →X−TX.
The latter is, up to homotopy, independent of all the choices involved in its
deﬁnition. It is called the Pontryagin–Thom collapse map.
3. Unde idem dicebant esse dualitatem et speciem dualitatis
A second main feature of the category of spectra we will use is that it is
monoidally closed, i.e., for any object X the functors
−⊗X : Sp →Sp
X ⊗−: Sp →Sp
have right adjoints. We we will write
F(X, −): Sp →Sp
for the right adjoint of the right multiplication functor −⊗X, i.e., we have
natural isomorphisms
Sp(Y ⊗X, Z) ∼= Sp(Y, F(X, Z))

AN EXPOSITION OF GHRR/2 THM IN THE FANCY LANGUAGE OF SPECTRA
15
for any spectra X, Y, Z.
Deﬁnition 3.1. The Alexander–Spanier dual DX of a spectrum X is
DX := F(X, S),
i.e., it is the spectrum characterized by
Sp(Y, DX) ∼= Sp(Y ⊗X, S),
naturally, for any spectrum Y .
It is immediate from the deﬁnition that D is a contravariant functor D: Sp →
Spop. Moreover, as S is the unit object, we have a natural isomorphism DS ∼= S.
In particular, for any space X we have a distinguished morphism
ϕ: S →DX,
which is the image under the duality functor D of the distinguished morphism
X →S.
We have already noticed (nice) topological spaces are special among spec-
tra. A somehow surprising fact is that, even from the spectral point of view,
compact smooth manifolds are special among (nice) topological spaces. We
have the following
Theorem 3.2 (Atiyah).
[Ati61] Let X be a compact smooth manifold. Then
there is an isomorphism of spectra under S
S
X−TX
DX
ϕ
γPT
∼
where TX is the tangent bundle of X, X−TX is the Thom spectrum of the
virtual bundle −TX, and γPT : S →X−TX is the Pontryagin–Thom collapse
map from Example 2.35.
From Theorem 3.2, we get
Corollary 3.3. Let X be a compact smooth manifold. Then DX carries a
natural X-comodule structure.
In particular, if E is a ring spectrum, then
[DX, E] carries a natural [X, E]-module structure.
We can now give the main deﬁnition of this Section:
Deﬁnition 3.4. Let E be a commutative ring spectrum.
A compact n-
dimensional smooth manifold X is E-orientable if [DX[n], E] is an [X, E]-
module of rank 1. An E-orientation of X is an isomorphism of [X, E]-modules
[X, E] →[DX[n], E]. An E-oriented compact n-dimensional smooth manifold
X is a pair (X, σ) where X is a compact n-dimensional smooth manifold and
σ : [X, E] →[DX[n], E] is an isomorphism of [X, E]-modules.

16
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
Notice that, if (X, σ) is an E-oriented compact n-dimensional smooth man-
ifold, then the datum of σ is equivalent to the datum of a generator τ = τ(X,σ)
of [DX[n], E] as an [X, E]-module. The element τ will be called the Thom
class of the E-orientation of X.
Deﬁnition 3.5. For (X, σ) an E-oriented compact n-dimensional smooth
manifold we have a naturally deﬁned integration map
Z E
(X,σ)
: [X, E] →[S[n], E]
given by the composition
[X, E]
[DX[n], E]
[S[n], E]
σ
ϕ∗
Remark 3.6. When E = L
i∈Z HZ[i], where HZ is the Eilenberg-Mac Lane
spectrum representing integral cohomology, the datum of an E-orientation of
a compact smooth manifold X is equivalent to the datum of an orientation of
X in the sense of diﬀerential geometry, and the integration map deﬁned above
is naturally identiﬁed with integration in singular cohomology.
4. Cubicula et bibliothecæ ad orientem spectare debent
So far we have been considering E-orientations of compact smooth mani-
folds, deﬁned in terms of Thom spectra of opposite tangent bundles. It will
be convenient to generalize this construction to arbitrary real virtual vector
bundles (recall from Remark 2.34 that we have a well deﬁned notion of Thom
spectrum XV for any real virtual vector bundle V over a (nice) topological
space X).
Deﬁnition 4.1. Let V be a rank r virtual real vector bundle over X. V is
is said to be E-orientable if [XV [−r], E] is an [X, E]-module of rank 1. An
E-orientation of V is the choice of an isomorphism σV : [X, E] ∼
−→[XV [−r], E].
Remark 4.2. Notice that with this deﬁnition each trivial real vector bundle n =
X × Rn →X has a canonical E-orientation. Namely, Xn = X[n], and so the
shift isomorphism provides a distinguished isomorphism [X, E] →[Xn[−n], E].
Deﬁnition 4.3. The datum of an E-orientation σV of a rank r virtual vector
bundle V is equivalent to the datum of a generator τV of [XV [−r], E] as an
[X, E]-module; namely, the image of the unit 1 ∈[X, E] via the isomorphism
σV . The element
τV : XV [−r] →E
will be called the Thom element of the E-oriented bundle V .
Remark 4.4. Since orientations are isomorphisms of [X, E]-modules from [X, E],
they are a torsor for the group of [X, E]-module automorphisms of [X, E], i.e.
for the group GL1[X, E] of units of [X, E]. In other words, if σV , ˜σV are two
E-orientations on an E-orientable rank r (virtual) vector bundle V over X,

AN EXPOSITION OF GHRR/2 THM IN THE FANCY LANGUAGE OF SPECTRA
17
there exists a unique element mV in GL1[X, E] ⊆[X, E] making the following
diagram
[X, E]
[X, E]
[XV [−r], E],
mV ·−
σV
˜σV
commute, where · is the product in [X, E]. Equivalently, we have τV = mV ·˜τV .
Remark 4.5. The functor X 7→GL1[X, E] is representable: there exists a
spectrum GL1E with a natural isomorphism
GL1[X, E] ∼= [X, GL1E].
Therefore a multiplier mV can be equivalently seen as a morphism mV : X →
GL1E.
Remark 4.6. A noteworthy property of E-orientations is that they satisfy the
2-out-of-3 property: if a short exact sequence 0 →V1 →V2 →V3 →0 of
vector bundles on a topological space is given, then E-orientations on two of
the vector spaces in the sequence canonically determine an E-orientation of
the third one, see [May06].
The main idea now is to study not only an E-orientation of a single vector
bundle, but to look at systems of coherent E-orientations of a family of vector
bundles.
Deﬁnition 4.7. A family of vector bundles F is said to be closed if it closed
under the operations of pullback and box sum. This means that:
(1) if the vector bundles V →X and W →Y are in the family F, then
the box sum V ⊞W →X ⊗Y is in F,
(2) for any map f : X →Y and every vector bundle V →Y in the family
F, then the pullback bundle f∗V →X is in F.
Remark 4.8. Notice that, if V, W are vector bundles over X, then via the
isomorphism ∆∗(V ⊞W) ∼= V + W from Remark 2.33 any closed family is
automatically closed under the operation of direct sum of vector bundles.
Example 4.9. Examples of closed families are the family of all (ﬁnite rank) real
vector bundles and the family of all (ﬁnite rank) trivial real vector bundles.
Other, more interesting examples are given by the family of all real oriented
vector bundles (i.e. real vector bundles V with a reduction of the structure
group to SO(rkV ), where rkV denotes the rank of V as a real vector bundle),
spin bundles (i.e, with reduction of the structure group to Spin(rkV )), and
complex vector bundles (i.e., even rank real vector bundles V with a reduction
of the structure group to U(1
2rkV )).
Deﬁnition 4.10. A coherent system of E-orientations on a closed family of
vector bundles F (or an E-orientation of F) is the datum of an E-orientation

18
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
σV : [X, E] ∼
−→[XV [−rkV ], E], for each V ∈F, satisfying the following coher-
ence conditions:
(1) Given V, W ∈F and f : X →Y the following diagrams commute.
[X, E] ⊗[Y, E]
[XV [−rkV ], E] ⊗[Y W [−rkW], E]
[X ⊗Y, E]
[XV ⊗Y W [−rkV −rkW], E]
σV ⊗σW
σV ⊞W
and
[Y, E]
[Y V [−rkV ], E]
[X, E]
[Xf∗V [−rkf∗V ], E]
f∗
σV
(fV )∗
σf∗V
(2) if a trivial vector bundle n is in F, then σn is the canonical orientation
of n.
The next deﬁnition is motivated by the following two facts we noticed in
Remarks 4.2 and 4.6: every trivial bundle is canonically oriented, and E-
orientations satisfy a 2-out-of-3 property.
Deﬁnition 4.11. A closed family of vector bundles F is said to be stable if it
contains the family of trivial bundles and satisﬁes the 2-out-of-3 property, i.e.,
if for a short exact sequence of vector bundles
0 →V1 →V2 →V3 →0
two of the Vi’s are in F then also the third is in F.
Example 4.12. Let us consider the family of complex vector bundles. This is
a closed family but not a stable family: it contains only “half” of the trivial
bundles (those with even rank as real vector bundles).
To obtain a stable
family out of the closed family of complex bundles we need to stabilize it,
i.e. consider vector bundles V such that V + k is complex for some k ≥0.
Such bundles are called stably complex. The family of stably complex vector
bundles is a stable family and it is the smallest stable family that contains
the family of complex bundles. More generally, for any closed family of vector
bundles we can consider its stabilization.
Remark 4.13. An E-orientation of a stable family F is deﬁned as an E-
orientation of F as a closed family. It is immediate to see that the datum of an
E-orientation of a closed family is equivalent to the datum of an E-orientation
on its stabilization.
Remark 4.14. Equivalently, conditions (1–2) above can be expressed in terms
of Thom elements as
(1) τV ⊞W = τV ⊗E τW ;
(2) τf∗V = (fV )∗τV ;
(3) τn = 1 ∈[X, E] = [Xn[−n], E].

AN EXPOSITION OF GHRR/2 THM IN THE FANCY LANGUAGE OF SPECTRA
19
Remark 4.15. Let {σV }V ∈F be a an E-orientation of a stable family F. Then it
makes sense to talk about the E-orientation σV of a virtual bundle V = V0−V1
where both V0, V1 ∈F. Namely, by the 2 out of 3 property, any complement
˜V1 of V1 is in F. Writing V = V0 + ˜V1 −n, we have natural isomorphisms of
shifted Thom spectra
XV [−rkV ] ∼= XV0+ ˜V1−n[−rkV ] ∼=
∼= XV0+ ˜V1[−rkV −n] ∼= XV0+ ˜V1[−rk(V0 + ˜V1)].
Since V0 + ˜V1 ∈F, we have an E-orientation σV0+ ˜V1, which we can take as
the E-orientation σV of V .
One checks that σV is well deﬁned, i.e., it is
independent of the choice of the complement ˜V1. This way the notion of E-
orientation of a stable family of vector bundles extends to stable families of
virtual vector bundles.
Remark 4.16. Let V, W be two (virtual) vector bundles over the manifold X in
the E-oriented family F. Then the pullback isomorphism V +W = ∆∗(V ⊞W),
and conditions (1–2) in Remark 4.14 give
τV +W = (∆V ⊞W )∗(τV ⊗E τW ) =: τV · τW .
The normalisation condition (3) then gives τV · τ−V = 1.
Remark 4.17. It follows from conditions (1–2) in Deﬁnition 4.10 that for any
(virtual) vector bundle V in the E-oriented stable family F on X, the multi-
plication by the Thom class τV ∈[XV [−rkV ], E] gives natural morphisms of
[X, E]-modules
[XW , E]
τV ·
−−→[XV +W [−rkV ], E].
As τV · τ−V = 1, these are actually isomorphisms. In particular, by taking
W = n, we see that multiplication by the Thom class τV is an isomorphism of
[X, E]-modules
[X[n], E]
τV ·
−−→[XV [n −rkV ], E],
for any n ∈Z.
So far we have deﬁned compatible systems of E-orientations of a stable
family of vector bundles F.
Again, rather than study a single system, it
is interesting to study how two compatible systems interact. As in Remark
4.4, two systems of E-orientations {σV , sV }V ∈F deﬁne a set of Thom classes
{τV , tV }V ∈F as well as a set of multipliers {mV }V ∈F, uniquely deﬁned by the
property τV = mV tV . Now we want to state some properties satisﬁed by the
set multipliers {mV }V ∈F.
Proposition 4.18. Let F be a stable family of vector bundles, and σ and s
two E-orientations of F, with associated Thom classes τ and t, and system of
multipliers m. Then for any two (virtual) vector bundles in the family F over
a space X, we have mV +W = mV mW , and for any trivial vector bundle n on
X we have mn = 1. In particular, mV +n = mV for any V and n.

20
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
Proof. As the X-comodule structure on XV +W and the X⊗X-comodule struc-
ture on XV ⊗XW are compatible (Remark 2.33), for any λ, µ ∈[X, E], we
have (λµ)(tV · tW ) = λtV · µtW . Therefore, by Remark 4.16 we have that
mV +W tV +W = τV +W
= τV · τW
= mW tV · mW tW
= mV mW tV · tW
= mV mW tV +W .
The conclusion follows from uniqueness of multipliers. The statement for trivial
bundles is immediate from the normalisation condition τn = tn = 1.
□
Corollary 4.19. For the multipliers associated to a (virtual) vector bundle
V ∈F and to its opposite −V , we have mV m−V = 1.
Remark 4.20. By Remark 4.5, the collection of multipliers can be seen as a
collection of morphisms mV : X →GL1E, for any (virtual) vector bundle V
over X, and the compatibility of multipliers with pullbacks amounts to the
commutativity of the diagrams
Y

for any map f : Y →X.
5. Inque tuo sedisti, Sisyphe, saxo
We can now introduce the notion of an E-oriented map between compact
smooth manifolds and deﬁne a pushforward in E-cohomology along an E-
oriented map. This will generalize the construction of the integration map
in Section 3, which will be recovered as the pushforward along the terminal
morphism X →∗for an E-oriented manifold X.
For a smooth map f : X →Y we write Tf for the virtual bundle over X
deﬁned by
Tf := TX −f∗TY.
Deﬁnition 5.1. An E-orientation of a smooth map f : X →Y is an E-
orientation of the virtual bundle −Tf.
Remark 5.2. Notice that an E-orientation of a manifold is a special case of
E-orientation for a morphism: X is E-oriented precisely when t : X →∗is.
Remark 5.3. The 2-out-of-3 property of E-orientation of (virtual) vector bun-
dles implies that also E-orientations of maps have a 2-out-of-3 property: if
X

21
are smooth maps and two out of {f, g, g◦f} are E-oriented then so is the third.
In particular, if f : X →Y is a smooth map between E-oriented manifolds then
f is canonically E-oriented. See [May06].
We now describe how to deﬁne a pushforward map
f∗: [X, E] →[Y [dim X −dim Y ], E]
for an E-oriented map f : X →Y which is a smooth ﬁbration with typical
ﬁbre a smooth compact manifold F of dimension d = dim X −dim Y . In this
situation we can think of f as a parametrized family over Y of (nice) topo-
logical spaces, i.e., as an ∞-functor f : Y →Top, where on the left we are
writing Y for its ∞-Poincaré groupoid (i.e., for the ∞-groupoid with objects
the points of Y , 1-morphisms the paths between points, 2-morphisms the ho-
motopies between paths, etc), and on the right Top is the ∞-category of (nice)
topological spaces, with homotopies between continuous maps, homotopies be-
tween homotopies, etc. as higher morphisms. Namely, the deﬁnition of (Serre)
ﬁbration is precisely a way of encoding this idea. Now, we are always looking
at topological spaces as spectra via Σ∞
+ , so we look at f as a family of spectra
parametrized by Y ,
Y
f−→Top
Σ∞
+
−−→Sp.
We refer the interested reader to [ABG11] or [MS06] for a detailed and
rigorous treatment of the category SpY of all such parametrized spectra with
parameter space Y ; for the aim of this note the intuitive deﬁnition sketched
above will be suﬃcient.
The ∞-category SpY inherits from Sp the pointwise monoidal structure with
unit object the pointwise unit SY given by the constant family with ﬁbre S over
Y , and so pointwise duals. In particular we will have an Alexander–Spanier
dual DY (f) coming with a distinguished morphism
ϕf : SY →DY (f)
in SpY . By putting everything together (formally, this means taking the ∞-
colimit of the natural transformation ϕf of ∞-functors Y →Sp), we get a
map
Y →colimY DY (f).
If we denote by Fy the ﬁbre of f : X →Y over y ∈Y , then Atiyah duality
pointwise identiﬁes DY (f)y = D(Fy) with F −Tf
y
so the one above is a map
Y →colimY F −Tf
y
.
Maybe not surprisingly, the colimit on the right hand side is the Thom spec-
trum X−Tf (see [ABG11] for a rigorous proof).
Therefore, at least when
f : X →Y is a smooth ﬁbration with compact ﬁbres, we have a natural
Pontryagin–Thom morphism
ϕPT : Y →X−Tf .

22
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
In the best of possible worlds, this would be true for any smooth map f,
not necessarily a ﬁbration with compact ﬁbres. And indeed it is. This can
be shown by factoring the map f as the composition of an embedding and
a smooth ﬁbration with compact ﬁbres and noticing that for an embedding
ι : X ,→Y one has the geometrically deﬁned Pontryagin–Thom collapse map
Y →Xνι = X−Tι. However, to our knowledge, the general Pontryagin–Thom
morphism Y →X−Tf for a general f has not yet been given a transparent
interpretation in terms of the monoidal closedness of the category of spectra.
See, however [ABG11, Remark 4.17] .
The morphism ϕPT : Y →X−Tf is a morphism of Y -comodules, where the
Y -comodule structure on X−Tf is induced by its X-comodule structure via f,
i.e., the diagram
Y
X−Tf
Y ⊗Y
Y ⊗X−Tf
∆Y
ϕP T
(f⊗id)◦∆Tf
id⊗ϕP T
commutes.
Therefore, if f is E-oriented we can deﬁne a pushforward map
f∗: [X, E] →[Y [dim X −dim Y ], E]
as the composition
[X, E]
σ−Tf
−−−→[X−Tf [dim X −dim Y ], E]
ϕ∗
P T
−−−→[Y [dim X −dim Y ], E].
When f is the terminal morphism, the pushforward map f∗is E-integration
over X.
Remark 5.4. Since ϕPT is a morphism of Y -comodules,
ϕ∗
PT : [X−Tf [dim X −dim Y ], E] →[Y [dim X −dim Y ], E]
is a morphism of [Y, E]-modules. Since [X, E]
σ−Tf
−−−→[X−Tf [dim X −dim Y ], E]
is an isomorphism of [X, E]-modules by deﬁnition of E-orientation, it will also
be an isomorphism of [Y, E]-modules where we look at every [X, E] module as
an [Y, E]-module via the ring homomorphism f∗: [Y, E] →[X, E]. Summing
up, f∗is a morphism of [Y, E]-modules, where we look at [X, E] as an [Y, E]-
module via f∗. This is the projection formula
f∗((f∗a) · x) = a · f∗(x)
for any a ∈[Y, E] and x ∈[X, E].
Remark 5.5. As we noticed, if X and Y are E-oriented, then f : X →Y gets a
canonical E-orientation by the 2-out-of-3 property. If moreover X and Y are
compact, multiplications by the Thom classes of TY and of f∗TY intertwine
the morphisms induced in E-cohomology by ϕPT and the dual of f, i.e., we

Remark 5.6. Since they are pullbacks along dualized morphisms, pushforwards
are covariantly functorial: if we are given a composition X
f−→Y
g−→Z of E-
oriented maps, then we have (g ◦f)∗= g∗◦f∗. This is immediately seen via
Remark 5.5 in case X, Y and Z are compact E-oriented manifolds, and by
a similar argument in the general case of E-oriented maps. See [Dye69] for
details.
6. E pluribus unum
Let us consider complex vector bundles. As every rank k complex vector
bundle over a manifold X is a pullback of the tautological vector bundle Vk →
BU(k), the naturality of orientations with respect to pullbacks tells us that,
in order to E-orient all complex vector bundles, we only need to orient all the
tautological bundles Vk →BU(k). Moreover, from
XV +1C = XV [2],
where 1C := C × X →X is the trivial rank 1 complex vector bundle over X,
and from j∗Vk+1 = Vk + 1C, where j : BU(k) →BU(k + 1) is the canonical
embedding, we see that a coherent system of E-orientations on all of the Vk’s
is equivalent to the datum of a commutative diagram

of maps of spectra, where we have written MU(k) for BU(k)Vk[−2k]. By the
universal property of the limit, this is equivalent to a single map of spectra
ρ: MU →E,
where by deﬁnition
MU = lim
−→MU(k)
This spectrum MU may informally be thought of as the inﬁnite desuspension
of the Thom spectrum of the inﬁnite dimensional tautological bundle over BU.

24
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
So far we have not used compatibility of orientations with formation of
direct sums, the latter operation giving the ∞-abelian group structure on BU.
Requiring this is equivalent to requiring that ρ: MU →E is a morphism
of homotopy commutative ring spectra.
The morphism ρ described above
has by construction the rather special property that all of its components
ρk = τk : MU(k) →E are generators of [MU(k), E], which are free rank 1
[BU(k), E]-modules. Quite remarkably, this property is actually not special
at all: every morphism of homotopy commutative ring spectra ρ: MU →E
has this property. Namely, one has MU(0) = S and the morphism MU(0) →
MU is the unit of MU. As a ring morphism preserves the unit, we have a
commutative diagram

Now we have the following
Lemma 6.1. The zero section ι: BU(1) →BU(1)V1 is a homotopy equiva-
lence.
Proof. Let L1;n = OPnC(1) be the universal line bundle over PnC. There is
a natural isomorphism (PnC)L1;n ∼= Pn+1C such that the zero section PnC →
(PnC)V1;n ∼= Pn+1C is identiﬁed with the standard inclusion PnC ,→Pn+1C as
the hyperplane at inﬁnity. Namely, let p be a point in Pn+1C \ PnC. Then
the collection of projective lines through p, with the point p removed, is a
holomorphic line bundle over PnC which is immediately seen to be isomorphic
to OPnC(1).
This realises the above mentioned identiﬁcation.
Taking the
limit over n we get an isomorphism BU(1) ∼= BU(1)L, where L = O(1) is
the universal line bundle over BU(1) ∼= P∞C. The universal line bundle L is
obtained from the tautological line bundle V1 by pullback along the equivalence
inv: BU(1) →BU(1) mapping each line bundle to its inverse induced by the
group automorphism of U(1) mapping z to z−1. By Remark 2.33 we therefore
have a commutative diagram

By the argument in Lemma 6.1 we see that ρ1 provides an extension ε of

where i1 : P1C →P∞C is the standard inclusion. As a consequence of the
fact that P∞C has a CW-complex structure with only even dimensional cells,
one can show that the datum of such an extension ε gives an isomorphism
of [P∞C, E]-modules [P∞C, E] ∼= [P∞C[−2], E] ∼= [MU(1), E] and that ε as
an element in [P∞C[−2], E] is a generator of this [P∞C, E]-module. This is a
generalized version of the usual isomorphism H2(P∞C; Z) ∼= H0(P∞C, Z) in
singular cohomology, see [Lur10, Lecture 4] for details. Therefore, ρ1 is an E-
orientation of the tautological line bundle V1 →BU(1). To conclude, we need
to show that also the ρk’s with k ≥2 are E-orientations of the tautological
vector bundles Vk →BU(k).
This is a corollary of the splitting principle
for complex bundles in E-cohomology, for E an E∞-ring spectrum. Namely,
the pullback of the tautological bundle Vk →BU(k) along the morphism of
topological spaces jk : BU(1)k →BU(k) splits as j∗
kVk = ⊞k
i=1V1 and this
induces identiﬁcations
j∗
k : [BU(k), E] ∼
−→[BU(1)⊗k, E]Symk
(jVk
k )∗: [MU(k), E] ∼
−→[MU(1)⊗k, E]Symk
where (−)Symk denotes the Symk-invariants. As the jk’s and the actions of the
symmetric groups are compatible with the canonical embeddings BU(k) →
BU(k + 1), this identiﬁes ρk with the symmetric element (ρ1)⊗k. The latter is
manifestly the datum of an isomorphism [BU(1)⊗k, E]Symk ∼= [MU(1)⊗k, E]Symk
of [BU(1)⊗k, E]Symk-modules, so the ρk’s are E-orientations. Again, see [Lur10,
Lectures 4 & 6] for details.
Summing up, by the above reasoning we have proven the following
Proposition 6.2. A system of compatible E-orientations on complex (and so
also on stably complex) vector bundles is equivalent to the datum of a single
morphism of homotopy commutative ring spectra ρ: MU →E.
In view of Proposition 6.2 it is natural to give the following deﬁnition.
Deﬁnition 6.3. Let E be an E∞-ring spectrum. A morphism of homotopy
commutative ring spectra ρ: MU →E is called a complex orientation of the
E∞-ring spectrum E.

26
MATTIA COLOMA, DOMENICO FIORENZA, AND EUGENIO LANDI
Remark 6.4. In particular, the identity morphisms idMU : MU →MU deﬁnes
the canonical complex orientation of MU.
Remark 6.5. As both MU and E are E∞-ring spectra, one may be tempted
to think the morphism MU →E deﬁned by a system of compatible E-
orientations on complex vector bundles is actually a morphism of E∞-ring
spectra, but it is actually not necessarily so. Namely, diﬀerently from the case
of commutative rings inside all rings, the ∞-category of E∞-ring spectra is not
a full ∞-subcategory of the ∞-category of ring spectra. This is so because the
enhancement of a ring spectra morphism between two E∞-rings to an E∞-ring
morphism is structure and not property: it is the additional datum of all the
coherent homotopies involved in the deﬁnition of a morphism of E∞-ring spec-
tra. By the same argument for commutative rings inside all rings, a morphism
of ring spectra between E∞-rings is automatically a morphism of homotopy
commutative ring spectra, but an enhancement to a full morphism of E∞-rings
may not exist. See [HL18] for a detailed discussion. Clearly, if MU →E is a
morphism of E∞-ring spectra then it is in particular a morphism of homotopy
commutative ring spectra, and so a complex orientation of E.
Remark 6.6. The above discussion shows that any lift of 1 ∈[S, E] to an
element ε ∈[P∞C[−2], E] under the pullback morphism [P∞C[−2], E] →
[P1C[−2], E] = [S, E] deﬁnes a morphism ρ1 : MU(1) →E that uniquely ex-
tends to a morphism of E∞-ring spectra ρ: MU →E. Therefore, (homotopy
classes of) complex orientations of E bijectively correspond to these lifts. More-
over, one sees by construction that ε is identiﬁed with the pullback of the Thom
class τL ∈[BU(1)L[−2], E] along the zero section ι: BU(1) →BU(1)L
Remark 6.7. Although we are not going to make use of this fact, it is worth
mentioning that the spectrum MU has an interesting geometric characteriza-
tion: it is the complex cobordism spectrum. For X a ﬁnite dimensional smooth
manifold the hom-set [X[n], MU] is the set of complex cobordism classes of
proper complex oriented maps f : Z →X with dim f := dim Z −dim X = n
[Qui71]. In particular, when X is a point we get the complex cobordism ring
ΩU :=
M
n≥0
[S[n], MU] =
M
n≥0
πSp
n MU.
The spectrum MU is (−1)-connected, i.e., its homotopy groups vanish in neg-
ative degree or, equivalently, MU ∼= MU≥0. This gives MU≤0 ∼= (MU≥0)≤0
∼= HπSp
0 (MU), and so the ﬁbre sequence associated to the 0-truncation of MU
is
MU>0 →MU →MU≤0 ∼= HπSp
0 (MU) = HZ.
As the 0-truncation morphism for a E∞-ring spectrum is an E∞-ring map, we
read from the above sequence an E∞-ring map
MU →HZ,
and so a canonical complex orientation for Z-valued singular cohomology.
Equivalently, this tells us that the family of all complex vector bundles has

AN EXPOSITION OF GHRR/2 THM IN THE FANCY LANGUAGE OF SPECTRA
27
a natural theory of Thom classes in Z-valued singular cohomology. We notice
that, by the functoriality of H−: CommRings →E∞-RingSp and since Z is ini-
tial in the category of commutative rings, for every commutative ring A there
is a distinguished morphism of E∞-ring spectra HZ →HA. As a consequence,
singular cohomology with coeﬃcients in A has a canonical complex orientation
for every commutative ring A.
Remark 6.8. If ψ: E →F is an homomorphism of homotopy commutative ring
spectra, then, a complex orientation ρ: MU →E of E can be pushed forward
to a complex orientation ψ∗ρ of F. In terms of Thom classes of (virtual) stably
complex vector bundles the orientation ψ∗ρ is simply deﬁned by
τ ψ∗ρ
V
= ψ∗(τ ρ
V ).
Remark 6.9. Assume we are given two complex orientations
ρ1, ρ2 : MU →E
of a multiplicative cohomology theory E. We have seen in Remarks 4.4 and
4.5 that the collection of multipliers between ρ1 and ρ2 is equivalent to the
datum of a compatible family of morphism mV : X →GL1E, indexed by
vector bundles V →X. Due to compatibility with pullbacks, we can restrict
to universal bundles: the datum of the whole collection of multipliers {mV } is
equivalent to the datum of the multipliers
mk : BU(k) →GL1E,
and so to the datum of a commutative diagram
· · ·
BU(k −1)
BU(k)
BU(k + 1)
· · ·
GL1E
mk−1
mk
mk+1
As BU = lim
−→BU(k), this is in turn equivalent to the datum of a single mor-
phism
m: BU →GL1E.
Notice that, since GL1[X, E] is the multiplicative subgroup of the commutative
ring [X, E], the group GL1[X, E] is an abelian group and so the spectrum
GL1E is an ∞-abelian group. As the direct sum of vector bundles is the group
operation on BU, the equation mV +W = mV · mW implies that m: BU →
GL1E is a morphism of homotopy abelian ∞-groups.
Group homomorphisms into an abelian group are themselves an abelian
group (more concretely: the bundlewise product of two compatible systems of
multipliers is again a compatible system of multipliers), and as we have already
noticed multiplying a compatible system of orientations with a compatible
system of multipliers one gets a multiplicative system of multipliers. In other
words, the space of complex orientations of E, i.e., the space of homotopy
commutative ring spectra morphisms MU →E is a torsor over the group
HomGrp(BU, GL1E).

Remark 6.10. The analysis that we made to establish the equivalence between
compatible systems of E-orientations on complex vector bundles and homo-
topy commutative ring spectra maps MU →E can be done in a completely
analogous way to establish an equivalence between compatible systems of E-
orientations on real (resp. oriented real) vector bundles and homotopy commu-
tative ring spectra maps MO →E (resp. MSO →E). By Thom’s theorem
(See [Koc96, Theorem 1.5.10]), both MO and MSO are cobordism spectra.
More precisely, MO is the real cobordism spectrum while MSO is the real
oriented cobordism spectrum and the respective cobordism rings are obtained
as
ΩO ∼=
M
n≥0
[S[n], MO] =
M
n≥0
πSp
n MO
and
ΩSO ∼=
M
n≥0
[S[n], MSO] =
M
n≥0
πSp
n MSO
Both MO and MSO are (−1)-connected spectra, so the ﬁbre sequences asso-
ciated to their 0-truncations are
MO>0 →MO →MO≤0 ∼= HπSp
0 (MO) = HZ/2
MSO>0 →MSO →MSO≤0 ∼= HπSp
0 (MSO) = HZ.
and we get two natural E∞-ring maps
MO →HZ/2
MSO →HZ.
This tells us that the family of all real vector bundles has a canonical ori-
entation/Thom classes in Z/2-valued singular cohomology and the family of
all oriented real vector bundles has a canonical orientation/Thom classes in
Z-valued singular cohomology.
7. Ab uno disce omnis
Assume an E-orientation of a stable family F is given. Thom spectra of
actual (i.e., nonvirtual) vector bundles come equipped with natural zero section
maps ιV : X →XV that are morphisms of X-comodules, i.e., the diagrams
X
XV
X ⊗X
X ⊗XV
∆

id⊗ιV
commute. So, for any V in F we have pullbacks
ι∗
V : [XV [−rkV ], E] →[X[−rkV ], E]
which are morphisms of [X, E]-modules.
Deﬁnition 7.1. The element eV := ι∗τV of [X[−rkV ], E] is called the Euler
class of V .

AN EXPOSITION OF GHRR/2 THM IN THE FANCY LANGUAGE OF SPECTRA
29
Remark 7.2. From the commutativity of
X
XV +W
X ⊗X
XV ⊗XW
∆
ιV +W
∆V ⊞W
ιV ⊗ιW
one gets the multiplicativity of Euler classes,
eV +W = eV · eW ,
where · is the product in [X, E]. For the trivial bundle 1, the zero section
ι1 : X →X1 = X[1] is the inclusion of X into its suspension, so it is homo-
topically trivial. From this and the multiplicativity of Euler classes it follows
that if V has a never zero section, so that V = V0 + 1 then, eV = 0.
The above general discussion applies in particular to complex orientations of
E, i.e., to a compatible system of E-orientation of complex vector bundles. By
Remark 6.6, the datum of such an orientation is equivalent to the the datum
of a Thom class τL such that, under the isomorphism of [P∞C, E]-modules
[MU(1), E] ∼= [P∞C[−2], E] induced by the pullback along the zero section
ι: BU(1) →BU(1)L, it lifts the unit element 1 ∈[S, E].
By deﬁnition of
the Euler class, we therefore have that the Euler class eL ∈[P∞[−2]C, E]
is a generator of [P∞C[−2], E] as a [P∞C, E]-module, with i∗
1eL = 1, where
i1 : P1C →P∞C is the inclusion. For a ﬁxed complex orientation on E, we will
write eE for the Euler class of the universal line bundle L = O(1), i.e, we will
write eE = eL.
Example 7.3. It follows from the proof of Lemma 6.1 and by the description of
MU given in Remark 6.7 that the Euler class eMU of the canonical complex ori-
entation of MU is the hyperplane inclusion P∞−1C ,→P∞C seen as a complex
oriented proper map of dimension −2 to P∞C, i.e., more precisely, that for any
n ≥1 the pullback i∗
neMU along the standard inclusion in : PnC ,→P∞C is the
complex oriented proper map of dimension −2 to PnC given by the hyperplane
inclusion Pn−1C ,→PnC.
Let now E be an even 2-periodic E∞-ring spectrum with Bott element βE.
One of the most important features of even 2-periodic spectra, and, in general,
of complex orientable spectra, lies in the cohomology of (complex) projective
spaces. Since the E-cohomology of P∞C is deﬁned to be the limit of the E-
cohomologies of the PnC’s over the (pullback of the) inclusions in : PnC ,→
Pn+1C, one gets that the choice of an element βEξ in [P∞C, E] is equivalent
to the datum of a compatible sequence {βEξn ∈[PnC, E]}n∈N, where ξn is the
pullback of ξ along the inclusion i : PnC ,→P∞C and hence equivalent to a
commutative diagram of rings

where the n-th arrow maps u to βξn.

tation of E, then the above diagram induces a sequence of compatible isomor-

The proof of this proposition is just a consequence of the collapsing at the
second page of the (cohomological) Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence for
PnC; a more detailed account of this argument can be found in [Ada74] or
[Koc96].
If we take the limit of the above diagram we get a commutative

isomorphism S ∼= P1C[−2]. Conversely, the existence of such a commutative
diagram is equivalent to the existence of a complex orientation of E.
Corollary 7.5. Every even 2-periodic ring spectrum is complex orientable.
Proof. Let E be an even 2-periodic ring spectrum. By the above discussion, to
prove that E is complex orientable we have to show that the distinguished ring
morphism [S, E][u] →[P1C, E] sending u 7→βE1 admits a lift through i∗
1. The
obstructions to such a lift are the obstructions to extending βE1: P1C →E to

so they lie in the singular cohomologies of P∞C with coeﬃcients in the abelian

zero, so all the obstructions vanish.

TX. To do so, let V be a stably complex vector bundle over X. As mV +n =
mV for any n, we may assume that V is a complex vector bundle. Also, as
the splitting principle works for every even 2-periodic E∞-ring spectrum E as
recalled above, it is not restrictive to assume that V splits as a direct sum of
complex line bundles Li classiﬁed by maps λi : X →P∞C. We then have

where L = O(1) is the universal line bundle on P∞C. So we just need to

This is deﬁned by the equation

L = mL · τ B
L . As the pullback along the zero section ι: P∞C →(P∞C)L
is an isomorphism of [P∞C, E]-modules, this is equivalent to the equation
eA = mL · eB, where eA and eB are the Euler classes of the E-orientations ρA
and ρB, respectively. By the conclusion of Section 7, the Euler classes eA and
eB uniquely determine a commutative diagram

the above takes the form

Remark 8.2. Notice that, since the restrictions of βEeA and βEeB to P1C
coincide (they are both equal to βE1), one has φ(u) = u + o(u), hence
tdA,B(u) = 1 + o(1).
With this notation we have
m−Tf = tdA,B(Tf)
and the product formula for the Todd class from Deﬁnition 8.1 tells how to
express this as a product of characteristic classes for TX and TY . Summing
up, we have proven the following
Theorem 8.3 (GHRR for a pair of complex orientations). Let ρA and ρB
be two complex orientations for an even 2-periodic E∞-ring spectrum E, and
let f : X →Y be a stably complex map.
Then the two pushforward maps

for any a ∈[X, E].
Remark 8.4. By multiplicativity and functoriality of the multipliers and by the

The conclusion then follows from the second-last equation in Section 8.

Remark 9.3. As a particular case, one can consider E = MU and ρE to be
the identity morphism of MU. Taking F = HPevQ and ρF : MU →HPevQ
the standard complex orientation ρH of HPevQ, one sees from Proposition 9.2
that for any complex orientation ψ: MU →HPevQ and any complex manifold
X of complex dimension n one has a commutative diagram

[Qui71]. The pushforward map in even periodic rational singular cohomology
induced by its standard complex orientation is the periodic version of the

a compact complex manifold, the pushforward map

10. Ita ego ab hoc archetypo labor et decido
The archetype of the formula in Proposition 9.2 is obviously the classical
Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch formula. Denote by KU the spec-
trum representing complex K-theory and by HPevQ the spectrum represent-
ing even periodic rational singular cohomology. Both spectra are multiplica-
tive and even 2-periodic.
With their standard complex orientations, their
shifted Euler classes are given by βKeρK = 1C −L−1 ∈[P∞C, KU] and by
βHeρH = βc1(L) ∈[P∞C, HPevQ], where c1 is the ﬁrst Chern class in singular
cohomology and β is a formal degree −2 variable; see, e.g. [LM07, Example
1.1.5] for the convention on the orientation of complex K-theory.
The Chern character ch: KU →HPevQ provides a multiplicative map of
even 2-periodic cohomology theories (i.e. ch(βK) = βH, see Example 2.25)
from complex K-theory to periodic rational singular cohomology. It can be
seen as the composition
KU
KUQ
HPevQ,
(−)Q
ch
∼
=
Φ
where (−)Q is the rationalization map and Φ: KUQ ∼= HPevQ is the equiva-
lence given by the splitting of rational spectra in sums of Eilenberg–Mac Lane
spectra, normalised so as to map the Bott element of KUQ to the Bott element
of HPevQ. By the general splitting for rational spectra we have
KUQ ∼= ⊕i∈ZHπSp
i (KUQ)[i] ∼= ⊕i∈ZH(πSp
i KU)⊗Q[i] ∼= ⊕j∈ZHQ[2j] = HPevQ.
Moreover, naturality of these equivalences with respect to the monoidal struc-
ture of spectra implies that KUQ ∼= HPevQ is an equivalence if E∞-ring spec-
tra. A good reference for this result in a cohomological ﬂavour can be found
in [Hil71]. Now, to get an explicit expression for the equivalence Φ: KUQ ∼=

HPevQ induced by rationalization, recall that KU is generated by the class of
the universal line bundle L, so we only need to determine Φ(L). This is an
element in [P∞C, HPevQ], so by the results in Section 7, there exists a unique
formal power series
f(u) =
∞
X
k=0
fkuk
with coeﬃcients in Q = [S, HPevQ] such that
Φ(L) = f(βc1(L)).
By naturality with respect to pullbacks, and since Φ is a ring homomorphism,
we have
1 = Φ(1C) = f0,
so we can write
f(u) = eg(u)
for a unique formal power series
g(u) =
∞
X
k=0
gkuk
with g0 = 0. Again by naturality with respect to pullbacks and since the tensor
product of vector bundles induces the product in K-theory, we have, for any
n ∈Z,
eg(n u)

βc1(L)
= eg(u)

nβc1(L)
= Φ(L⊗n) = Φ(L)n = en g(u)

βc1(L)
.
As evaluating at βc1(L) is an isomorphism Q[[u]] ∼
−→HPevQ(P∞C), this gives
g(n u) = n g(u),
for any n ∈Z,
so g(u) is a linear function: g(u) = g1 u for some g1 ∈Q. Imposing that Φ
preserves Bott elements we ﬁnd
βc1(L|P1C) = 1 −e−g1βc1(L|P1C) = g1βc1(L|P1C)),
and so g1 = 1, i.e., f(u) = eu and Φ = ch. As we are interested in
tdch∗ρK,ρH(u),
we have to identify the map φ determined by the commutative diagram
[S, HPevQ][[u]]
[S, HPevQ][[u]]
[P∞C, HPevQ]
u 7→φ(u)
u 7→ch(1C−L−1)
u 7→βc1(L)
As ch(1C −L−1) = 1 −e−βc1(L), the map φ is
φ(u) = 1 −e−u.

Therefore the Todd function associated with the Chern character and the stan-
dard orientations of complex K-theory and even periodic rational cohomology
is
tdch∗ρK,ρH(u) =
u
1 −e−u .
11. Exeunt
Readers so patient to have read until here may be wondering what is the
non-topological half of the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem
we were hinting at in the title. To explain this, consider a compact complex
manifold X together with a holomorphic vector bundle V over it. Then the
Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem can be stated as the identity
χ(X; V ) =
Z
X
ch(V ) td(TX),
where on the left we have the holomorphic Euler characteristic of X with
coeﬃcients in the holomorphic bundle V (or, equivalently, in its sheaf V of
holomorphic sections).
This Euler characteristic is the pushforward in the
analytical K-theory of X (or equivalently in the bounded derived category
of coherent sheaves on X) of the element [V ] in KUan(X) to an element in
KUan(∗) = Z along the terminal morphism πX : X →∗. That is, we have
χ(X; V ) = πKU,an
X,∗
([V ]).
By the discussion in the previous sections, the statement of the Hirzebruch–
Riemann–Roch theorem can be rewritten as
analytical/algebro-geometrical part

topological part
,
where the right part of the identity is what we have discussed in this note, while
the left part of the identity, i.e., the identiﬁcation between the push-forward in
analytic (or algebro-geometric) K-theory and the pushforward in topological
K-theory is a deep result in the holomorphic (or algebro-geometric) setting,
unattainable by purely topological methods. Analogous considerations apply
to the more general case of the pushforward along a proper holomorphic map
between holomorphic manifolds considered in the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–
Riemann–Roch theorem.
As a conclusion, let us recall how to determine the Todd function u/(1 −
e−u) just by assuming the identity πKU,an
X,∗
([V ]) = πKU
X,∗([V ]), where V is a
holomorphic vector bundle V over a compact complex manifold X, holds for
some complex orientation ρ: MU →KU of the topological complex K-theory.
Under these assumptions, by the discussion in the previous sections we will
have in particular the identities
χ(PnC; OPnC) =
Z
PnC
tdch∗ρ,ρH(TPnC) = β−n
Z HPevQ
PnC
tdch∗ρ,ρH(TPnC)

for a suitable formal power series tdch∗ρ,ρH(u). By the Euler exact sequence
0 →OPnC →
n
M
i=0
OPnC(1) →TPnC →0
we get
tdch∗ρ,ρH(TPnC) = tdch∗ρK,ρH(βc1(OPnC(1)))n+1
so that, writing
(tdch∗ρ,ρH(u))n+1 =
∞
X
k=0
an+1,kuk
we obtain
χ(PnC; OPnC) = an+1,n.
On the other hand
χ(PnC; OPnC) =
n
X
q=0
h0,q(PnC) = 1.
Therefore the formal series tdch∗ρ,ρH(u) must satisfy an+1,n = 1 for every n,
i.e., it must have the property that the coeﬃcient of un in (tdρ(u))n+1 equals 1
for any n. A classical computation using the Lagrange inversion formula shows
that there exists a unique formal power series with this property: the power
series expansion of
tdch∗ρK,ρH(u) =
u
1 −e−u .
As the Chern character is an isomorphism from rationalized complex K-theory
to even 2-periodic rational singular cohomology, this shows that the only
possible complex orientation of topological K-theory for which one can have
the complex analytic/algebro-geometric half of the Grothendieck–Hirzebruch–
Riemann–Roch theorem is ρK, i.e., the one with (shifted) Euler class βKUeKU =
1C −L−1, thus motivating this apparently less natural choice with respect to
βKUeKU = L −1C. Clearly, as far as one is not concerned with the complex
analytic/algebro-geometric half of the theorem, this second orientation, with
corresponding Todd function u/(eu −1), is an equally valid choice, and it is ac-
tually quite a common choice for deﬁning a complex orientation of topological
K-theory in algebraic topology.
