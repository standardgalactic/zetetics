Planck’s Constant h
elsewhere in this compendium. In fact approaches based on such considerations do
provide a consistent and coherent account of quantum phenomena, removing many
of the paradoxes thrown up by the even more conventional approaches. Nevertheless
there has been a general reluctance amongst the majority of physicists to embrace
the approach based on the notion of a pilot wave.
A comprehensive survey of the pilot wave theory can be found in de Broglie
[10,11].

Planck’s Constant h
Dieter Hoffmann
Planck’s constant h is one of the fundamental constants of nature and crucial for
our physical understanding of atomic and subatomic processes. It was introduced
in 1899 by Max Planck (1858–1947) in the context of his investigations of heat
radiation. While trying to derive Wien’s radiation law and to examine the thermal

equilibrium between matter and radiation in a cavity, Planck used a model now
called Planck’s resonator. Its entropy was deﬁned as
S = −E
av ln E
ebv ,
where v is the frequency of the radiation and “a and b stand for two univer-
sal positive constants.” (Planck 1899, p. 465) Planck had already calculated
the value for constant b (now designated h) in “thermodynamic fashion” as
b = 6.885 × 10−27erg sec. The current best value for h is 6.27 × 10−27 erg sec
or 6.626 × 10−34 J s.
By the way, Planck also showed that the second constant a is deﬁned by h/k,
where k is Boltzmann’s constant and depends on the deﬁnition of temperature. With
h and k one can calculate very precisely the values for Loschmidt’s constant (L) and
the electric elementary quantum (e) from heat radiation measurements.
In the same paper from May 1899 Planck also pointed out that this new funda-
mental constant of nature opens up the possibility of combining the gravitational
constant (G) and the velocity of light (c) “to deﬁne units for length, mass, time
and temperature which keep their meaning for any time and any civilization, even
extraterrestrial and unhuman ones. Therefore one can designate them as ‘natural
units’.” ([1], p. 480; [2], p. 121)
Soon thereafter, during the fall of 1900, Planck noticed that the meaning of b
resp. h was not restricted to metrology or the foundation of natural units. By way
of explanation by a new radiation formula – the so-called  Planck’s radiation law,
which replaced Wien’s law – the constant h again plays a central role. For the energy
of Planck’s resonators, which regulate the exchange of energy between matter and
radiation in a cavity, one had to postulate:
E = hv
This introduction of discrete levels of energy and its revolutionary character for the
physical understanding of nature was not yet fully understood at that time. Initially,
it merely agreed with the available measurement data. Planck himself ﬁrst spoke of
discrete energy levels of his resonators in 1908. That is why the beginning of our
modern understanding of the quantum character of atomic processes and the crucial
role of h is signiﬁed less by Planck than by Albert Einstein and his hypothesis of
 light quanta from 1905 as well as his and Paul Ehrenfest’s analysis of Planck’s
radiation law in 1905/06. It took an additional decade for the revolutionary charac-
ter of Planck’s quantum hypothesis and Planck’s constant to become fully clear and
quantum physics to become a central part of modern physical research. This was not
the work of Planck and his generation but of a younger one, the founders of quan-
tum mechanics during the 1920. With this theory and the  Heisenberg uncertainty
principle, the fundamental role of h for our understanding of the atomic world was
fully elucidated.

POVM (Positive Operator Value Measure)
Roderich Tumulka
POVM: positive-operator-valued measure, also called generalized observable.
A mathematical object, consisting of a family of operators on  Hilbert space,
that occurs in quantum theoretical formulas for the probability distribution of the
random outcome of a quantum mechanical experiment. The concept of POVM
contains, as a special case, that of  observables represented by  self-adjoint
operators.
Overview
Outline of Deﬁnition. The word “measure” in “positive-operator-valued measure” is
understood in the sense of mathematical probability and measure theory [5], where
it means “additive set function”. A set function E(·) is a function whose argument
is a set (rather than a number, or a point in space). Possible arguments are subsets 
of a basic set . Typical relevant examples of  include the real line R, n-space Rn,
or ﬁnite sets. A set function is called additive if for any two disjoint sets 1, 2 it
is true that
E(1 ∪2) = E(1) + E(2).
