CHAPTER 11
General Properties of Earthquakes
Fermi lists the Mercalli scale of earthquake intensity and es-
timates the energy released in the 1906 San Francisco earth-
quake. The Mercalli scale is a qualitative scale that classiﬁes
earthquakes by their local eﬀects. For example, class I is a
weak earthquake not felt by humans at the scene, while class
V is moderate and felt by nearly everyone near the scene; class
VIII is so severe it causes ordinary buildings to collapse.
“Great earthquakes” are ones that release enormous amounts
of energy. Part of that energy is radiated as seismic waves,
the properties of which are discussed in Chap. (12). The re-
mainder of it goes into local heat and destruction. The latter
is usually called “plastic deformation.” The total energy re-
leased in the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 is generally es-
timated to be in the range of 1023−24 erg. The Earth Alabama
website is helpful in grasping the signiﬁcance of such a huge
amount of energy (EarthAlabama 2017). It is noted there
that the total energy released in the San Francisco earth-

quake was at least a thousand times larger than that released
in the nuclear weapon detonated over Hiroshima in 1945.
A method of estimating the energy released in great earth-
quakes which has some overlap with Fermi’s method, makes
use of a quantity known as the “seismic moment” (Kanamori
1977). It is denoted as M0 and deﬁned as follows:
M0 = µA ¯D,
(11.1)
where µ is the shear coeﬃcient of the rock near the fault,
A is the area of the fault that moves during the earthquake,
and ¯D is the average distance the area A moves during the
earthquake. The product A ¯D is a volume, while µ has the di-
mension of pressure, i.e., force/area, so M0 has the dimension
of energy.
Although it has the right units, M0 is not the energy re-
leased in the earthquake. That can be seen by ﬁrst consider-
ing the work done as the area A moves. Roughly speaking,
work is force times distance, but account must be taken of
the fact that the force moving the area A in the direction of
its displacement is decreasing as the displacement increases.
This produces a factor of 1/2 in the energy formula, similar
to the 1/2 that appears in the energy of a charged capacitor.
The force in the direction of the displacement at any stage
of the earthquake can be written as σA, where σ is the shear
stress at the given displacement. If the net decrease in the
stress is ∆σ, then equating the work done to the energy re-
leased, we have
W0 = 1
2∆σA ¯D = (∆σ
2µ )M0.
(11.2)
The quantity ∆σ is known to be ∼(2 −6) × 107 dyne/cm2,
and for rock in the Earth’s crust, µ ∼(3−6)×1011 dyne/cm2

159
(Kanamori 1977). The ratio 2µ/∆σ is dimensionless and is
∼2 × 104, so W0 becomes
W0 ∼
M0
2 × 104 .
(11.3)
Using a number of diﬀerent techniques, the value of the seis-
mic moment for the San Francisco earthquake has been de-
termined to be
(M0)SF ∼1028 erg,
(11.4)
which gives, using Eq. (11.2),
(W0)SF ∼5 × 1023 erg.

Figure 11.1: Schematic of San Francisco earthquake
In estimating the energy released in the San Francisco
earthquake, Fermi used the ﬁrst expression in Eq. (11.2). For
this earthquake, the area of the fault involved in the earth-
quake can be approximated by a rectangle of area A = LW,
where L is the horizontal dimension of A, and W is the ver-
tical dimension. The standard values, as used by Fermi for
L, W, and ¯D, were L = 435 km, W = 20 km, and ¯D = 4 m.
Fig. (11.1) shows schematically the geometry of the earth-
quake. Using these ﬁgures, the volume combination A ¯D turns
out to be 3.48 × 1016 cm3. For the formula Fermi employs, he
has used a ﬁgure of 10 dyne/cm2 for ∆σ, which leads to his
result
(W0)SF−Fermi ∼1.74 × 1024 ergs,
(11.6)

160
CHAPTER 11. EARTHQUAKE PROPERTIES
approximately three times the value given in Eq. (11.5). Given
the uncertainties in the San Francisco earthquake parameters
and the fact that Fermi made his estimate in the early 1940s,
it is remarkable that his value is within a reasonable factor
of the generally accepted result.
