ABSTRACT: Speaking rate and articulation rate data are
provided for a group of 10 Australian children (aged 30–
51 months). Articulation rates were significantly faster
than overall speaking rates. Speaking rate and articula-
tion rate were positively correlated with utterances up to
seven syllables in length. The results are compared to
previous data obtained for older Australian children, as
well as data obtained for same-aged American English-
speaking children. The clinical applicability of the
present data is discussed.

peech rate is assumed to reflect the speed at
which an individual executes articulatory
movements for speech production (Crystal &
House, 1982, 1990; Fonagy & Magdics, 1960; Gracco &
Abbs, 1988). Speech rate is typically estimated from
samples of connected speech spoken spontaneously or read.
The sample is analyzed acoustically and the resulting unit
of measure is either words per minute (wpm) or syllables
per minute (spm). The spm measure is thought to represent
a more precise estimate of speaking rate because connected
speech samples often contain words of varying syllabic
length (Carroll, 1967; Pimsleur, Hancock, & Furey, 1977).
There are various methods of calculating speech rate.
Speaking rate is the traditional measure that is calculated
as the number of syllables produced in a speech sample
divided by the time needed for completing the speech
sample (Cotton, 1936; Grosjean & Lane, 1974; Hall, Amir,
& Yairi, 1999; Kelly & Steer, 1949). An alternative method
is to calculate articulation rate. Articulation rate is mea-
sured as the number of syllables produced in a timed
speech sample following removal of silent intervals from
the sample (Crystal & House, 1990; Dankovicova, 1997;
Miller, Grosjean, & Lomanto, 1984). Because of the
variability associated with silent intervals, speaking rate
provides a general estimate of verbal output and may vary
considerably depending on such factors as the individual
speaker, emotional state of the speaker, and type of
speaking situation (Miller et al., 1984). Articulation rate is
assumed to provide a sensitive estimate of actual speech
execution time as a result of removing silent intervals from
the speech sample (Hall et al., 1999).
Speech rate data are useful for identifying and treating
speech timing disorders (Hall et al., 1999; Hammen &
Yorkston, 1996; Walker, 1988; Yorkston, Beukelman,
Strand, & Bell, 1999). For example, a common therapy

technique in the treatment of stuttering is to significantly
decrease speaking rate (e.g., Neilson & Andrews, 1993).
Speaking at a carefully controlled rate allows the stutterer
additional time to coordinate the various speech systems
(respiratory, laryngeal, supralaryngeal) and to coordinate the
transition between speech sounds. In this controlled-rate
approach, stutterers practice the coordinated movements of
speech as well as appropriate phrasing and pausing.
Speaking rate is gradually increased until it closely approxi-
mates that considered normal. Speaking rate disturbances
also are a common problem among individuals with severe
hearing impairment (Colton & Cooker, 1968; Gay, 1978;
Gilbert & Hoodin, 1984; Miller, 1981) as well as motor
speech disorders (Dworkin, 1991; Turner, Tjaden, &
Weismer, 1995). The abnormalities in speaking rate influence
not only articulatory precision, but also speech intelligibility.
Depending on the particular motor speech disorder (e.g.,
flaccid dysarthria, hyperkinetic dysarthria), the objective in
therapy would be to either increase speaking rate if slowness
was exhibited or decrease speaking rate if quickness was
exhibited (Marshall & Karow, 2002).
An extensive body of speech rate data exists for speakers
of American English (AE) (e.g., Amster, 1984; Chermak &
Schneiderman, 1986; Crystal & House, 1990; Kent & Forner,
1980; Kowal, O’Connell, & Sabin, 1975; Pindzola, Jenkins
& Lokken, 1989; Sharf & Lehman, 1984; Smith, Wasowicz,
& Preston, 1987; Tsao & Weismer, 1997; Walker, 1988;
Walker, Archibald, Cherniak, & Fish, 1992). The results
obtained for adults and children can be summarized into four
general findings. First, most studies provide data regarding
speaking rate and overlook the measurement of articulation
rate. Second, the relationship between speech rate and gender
is unclear. Some studies have found no gender differences in
rate (Kowal et al., 1975; Walker, 1988); however, there are
reports of women speaking faster then men (Lutz & Mallard,
1986). Third, adults speak faster than children, having a
mean overall speaking rate of 260 spm as compared to a
speaking rate of approximately 190 spm for 8- to 10-year-
old children (Chermak & Schneiderman, 1986; Kowal et al.,
1975). Finally, the relationship between speech rate and
length of utterance also seems to differ between adults and
children. Adults demonstrate a fast speaking rate in long
utterances and a slow speaking rate in short utterances
(Fonagy & Magdics, 1960; Malecot, Johnston, & Kizziar,
1972). However, the relationship between utterance length
and speaking rate is less clear for children. Amster (1984)
reported a significant positive correlation between speaking
rate and utterance length in children aged 2–4 years.
However, a more recent study by Walker et al. (1992)
failed to find a significant correlation between speaking
rate and utterance length for children aged 3–5 years. The
differences observed between adults and children for
speaking rate, as well as speaking rate associated with
utterance length, are assumed to reflect developmental
differences in speech motor control (Walker et al., 1992).
There are two often-cited studies of speaking rate for
Australian English (AuE). Bernard (1965) reported conver-
sational speaking rates for 16- to 18-year-olds, noting an
average rate of 220 spm. Block and Kellen (1996) exam-
ined conversational speaking rate in adults aged 21–30
years and 9-year-old children, noting rates of approximately
238 spm and 175 spm, respectively. Compared to the data
available for AE speakers, a great deal remains to be
learned regarding the speech rate of AuE speakers. Provi-
sion of additional speech rate data for Australian speakers
is a necessary clinical goal because information regarding
normal speaking rate is important for clinicians who treat
clients of all ages. Of special interest in the present study
is that (a) there are no speech rate data available for AuE-
speaking children younger than 9 years of age and (b) the
relationship between utterance length and speaking rate in
AuE children younger than 9 years of age is yet unknown.
The purpose of the present study was to perform a
preliminary study of speaking rate and articulation rate in
young Australian children aged 2–4 years. The present
work addresses a similar issue raised by Walker et al.
(1992) in their examination of young AE-speaking children.
Specifically, there are limited speech rate data on AuE-
speaking preschool children. Such data are essential for the
identification and diagnosis of deviations in rate and for
the management and treatment of speech timing disorders
(Walker et al., 1992). Previous studies of AE have found a
developmental pattern of increasing rate corresponding to
increases in chronological age (Chermak & Schneiderman,
1986; Kent & Forner, 1980; Kowal et al., 1975). Assuming
that the same pattern of development is true of Australians,
it was predicted that AuE-speaking children aged 2–4 years
would demonstrate a slower speaking rate as compared to
previously published data for older AuE-speaking children
and adults (Block & Kellen, 1996). Furthermore, past
studies have found length of utterance to be a significant
variable in the speech rate of adults, but the data available
for children are incongruous with this finding. In addition,
the relationship between utterance length and articulation
rate has yet to be determined. It was predicted that
measures of speaking rate and articulation rate would be
significantly correlated with utterance length in young AuE-
speaking children.
METHOD
Participants
Ten children (5 boys and 5 girls) participated in the study.
The children ranged in age from 30 months to 51 months,
with a mean age of 39 months. Children were recruited in
this age range to allow for comparison to speaking rate
data obtained for AE children of approximately the same
age (Walker et al., 1992). All of the children were born and
reared in the metropolitan area of Sydney, Australia, and
came from monolingual families. None of the children was
suspected to have a speech, language, or hearing disorder
at the time of data collection. All children were deemed to
demonstrate normal communication behavior as determined
by either parent or teacher report. The normalcy of each
participant’s speech and language was confirmed at the
time of data collection. Each participant’s conversational
speech was informally evaluated by one of the researchers

who is a speech-language pathologist. The Human Ethics
Committee of the University of Sydney approved this study.
Speech Sampling
Each child was audio recorded once while engaged in
unstructured conversation with one of the researchers.
Audio recordings were made on high-quality audiotapes
(Maxell, C60) using a cassette recorder (Marantz, PMD-
360) in conjunction with a unidirectional dynamic micro-
phone (Shure, 515SD). Imitated utterances were not
included in the analysis because of the possibility of
imitations of the prosodic features of the adult. The topic
of conversation was not held constant across children. The
researcher used open-ended questions posed to each child
to elicit conversational discourse. The same researcher was
used for the collection of all speech samples. Similar to the
procedures of Walker et al. (1992), the researcher used a
reduced speaking rate with each child to avoid possible
influence of an adult (increased) speech rate on the child’s
rate. The researcher used an average speaking rate of 214
spm and an articulation rate of 219 spm during the
interaction with each child.
The goal of each recording session was to collect approxi-
mately 40 utterances containing three or more syllables.
Utterances of one or two syllables in length were excluded
from the database. Similar to the definition used by Hall et
al. (1999), an utterance was defined as a string of words
(syllables) that (a) communicated an idea, (b) was grammati-
cally complete, and (c) excluded nonspeech sounds. An
utterance was further defined as a string of syllables that did
not contain a silent interval greater than 250 ms (Flipsen,
2002; Miller et al., 1984; Tsao & Weismer, 1997). That is,
utterances were separated on the basis of a 250-ms (or
greater) interutterance silent interval. Previous investigations
of speaking rate in children have either collected a large
number of utterances per child across a small participant
sample (Hall et al., 1999), or collected fewer than 10
utterances per child across a large participant sample (Walker
et al., 1992). The sampling employed in the present study
was similar to that employed by Hall et al. (1999), who
chose to collect approximately 45 utterances per child across
a group of 8 children. Children spoke into a dynamic
microphone and their utterances were recorded on low-noise
magnetic audiotape. No apparent deviations from habitual Fo
and intensity were observed during the recordings. The
children were able to use a typical speaking voice devoid of
“silly” or noncompliant vocal behaviors. All recordings were
obtained in locations perceptually judged by the researcher
to be low in ambient noise.
Acoustic Analysis
Each child’s individual utterances were analyzed acousti-
cally using a commercially available speech analysis system
(Kay CSL-4300B, Lincoln Park, NJ). Each utterance was
introduced via a cassette recorder (Marantz PMD-360,
Chatsworth, CA) into a personal computer (Gateway 2000,
CPU 586) and digitized at a 10,000-Hz sampling rate with
16 bits of resolution. Each utterance was measured for
speaking rate and articulation rate as defined below. A
person trained in using the speech analysis system made all
measurements.
Speaking rate. Each utterance was displayed on a
computer monitor as an amplitude-by-time waveform. On
the basis of this display, a vertical cursor was placed at the
onset of the first syllable of the utterance and a second
cursor was placed at the offset of the last syllable in the
utterance. Syllable onset was taken to be the point on the
displays where acoustic energy could first be detected.
Offset of the last syllable was the point at which acoustic
energy could no longer be detected. The time interval
between the two cursors was recorded as the total utterance
duration. The total number of syllables produced in the
utterance was then divided by the total utterance duration
to derive speaking rate. The unit of measure for speaking
rate was spm. An average of the individual utterance
speaking rates was determined for each child.
Articulation rate. The articulation rate for each utterance
was determined by dividing the number of syllables
produced by the actual speech running time, which was
defined as the total duration of an utterance with silent
intervals exceeding 150 ms deleted (Rochester, 1973; Tosi,
1974). A pair of vertical cursors was placed at the onset
and offset of each intra-utterance silent interval and deleted
from the acoustic waveform. After all silent intervals were
removed, the time between onset of the acoustic signal to
offset of the acoustic signal reflected the speech running
time. The unit of measurement for articulation rate was the
same as speaking rate (spm). An average of the individual
utterance articulation rates was determined for each child.
An example of a waveform illustrating speaking rate and
articulation rate is shown in Figure 1. The top panel in the
figure shows an unedited utterance that was used to
calculate speaking rate. The lower panel shows the same
utterance with silent intervals removed in order to calculate
articulation rate.
Measurement Reliability
The speech samples of 2 children were randomly selected
from the original speech recordings for assessment of inter-
judge measurement reliability. A second individual who was
experienced with acoustic measurements determined the
average speaking rate and articulation rate for each child’s
speech sample, and these values were compared to the
original measurement values. Average absolute measurement
errors for speaking rate and articulation rate were 5 spm
and 3 spm, respectively. The Pearson product moment
correlation coefficients for speaking rate and articulation
rate were .85 and .87 (p < 0.01), respectively.

rates are listed in Table 1. The average speaking rate for

the group of children was 205 spm (SD = 18), ranging
from 178 spm to 251 spm across children. The average
articulation rate for the group was 221 spm (SD = 18),
ranging from 192 spm to 262 spm across children. A t test
for dependent means was performed to determine if
speaking rate significantly differed from articulation rate.
The test was significant [t(9) = 4.59, p < .001], with
speaking rate being slower than articulation rate. The data
were further examined according to gender. The average
speaking rates for boys and girls were 197 spm and 212
spm, respectively. The average articulation rates for boys
and girls were 211 spm and 231 spm, respectively. Two t
tests for independent means were performed to evaluate
gender differences for speaking rate and articulation rate.
Neither test was significant, indicating no difference
between boys and girls in their speaking rate and articula-
tion rate.
Utterance Length
The total number of multisyllabic utterances collected
across the 10 children was 339, which totaled 2,037

syllables. The utterances ranged in length from 3 to 16
syllables, with a mean utterance length of six syllables. The
average speaking rates and articulation rates obtained for
each length of utterance are displayed in Figure 2. The
relationship of utterance length to speaking rate and
articulation rate was examined by calculating Pearson
product moment correlations. Both correlations were very
low (utterance length and speaking rate: r = –.37; utterance
length and articulation rate: r = .08), indicating no signifi-
cant relationship between utterance length and speech rates.
However, the correlations were likely influenced by the
uneven distribution of speech rates sampled for each

utterance length. For example, eighty 4-syllable utterances
were collected but only six 12-syllable utterances were
collected across the group. Because of the uneven utterance
distribution, some additional analyses were performed.
First, examination of the speech rate data plotted in Figure
2 indicated a general increase in speaking rate and articula-
tion rate between utterances of 3 to 7 syllables in length,
with the fastest rate observed for utterances of 7 syllables
in length. Utterances ranging from 3 to 7 syllables in
length accounted for 80% of the entire database. The
speech rates for utterances of 8 to 16 syllables in length
reflected a less consistent pattern as a function of increas-
ing utterance length. Separate Pearson correlation statistics
were computed to examine the relationship between speech
rates and utterances of 3 to 7 syllables in length, and also
for utterances of 8 to 16 syllables in length. Results
indicated significant correlations for speaking rate (r = .72,
p < .05) and articulation rate (r = .81, p < .05) across
utterances of 3 to 7 syllables in length. The correlations for
speaking rate and articulation rate across utterances of 8 to
16 syllables in length were not significant, r = –.32 and
–.53, respectively.
Finally, following the approach of Haselager, Slis, and
Rietveld (1991), the group speaking rate and articulation
rate data were collapsed into three categories that repre-
sented utterances of varying syllabic length: short utter-
ances (3–4 syllables), average utterances (5–6 syllables),
and long utterances (7+ syllables). The division of data into
these three categories accounted for 125 utterances, 107
utterances, and 107 utterances, respectively. The results of
the analysis are displayed in Figure 3. Examination of the
figure indicated a general trend toward increasing speaking
rate and articulation rate with increasing utterance length.
The results of the additional correlational analyses, paired
with the results displayed in Figure 3, indicated a pattern
of increases in speech rate corresponding to increases in
utterance length.
DISCUSSION
One goal of the present research was to provide speaking
rate and articulation rate data for children younger than 9
years of age. To the best of our knowledge, no such data
were previously available for Australian speakers. The
present group of children demonstrated a speaking rate of
205 spm and an articulation rate of 221 spm. Articulation
rate was significantly faster than speaking rate, indicating a
faster speech execution time as a result of removing silent
intervals from the speech sample. Results of an analysis
according to gender found no significant differences
between boys and girls for either speaking rate or articula-
tion rate. It was originally predicted that the present group
of children aged 2–4 years would demonstrate slower
speech rates as compared to the data for Australian 9-year-
olds and adults reported previously by Block and Kellen
(1996). These researchers found an average conversational
speaking rate of approximately 175 spm for 9-year-olds and
238 spm for adults. Although the speaking rates for the
present group of children were slower than past data for
adults, our children appeared to speak faster than 9-year-
olds. Two possibilities may account for the faster speaking
rates in 2- to 3-year-olds as compared to 9-year-olds. First,
Block and Kellen’s data for 9-year-olds are based on a
participant sample of 60 children, whereas the present
group contained only 10 children. Therefore, the results
obtained for the 2- to 4-year-olds may not be reflective of
the true speaking rate for this age group. However, it also
is possible that the speech rate measurement techniques
used in the two studies are responsible for the rate differ-
ences observed. The present study involved detailed
acoustic measurement of utterance duration using a
waveform analysis system, whereas Block and Kellen used
a manually operated device to tabulate the number of
syllables spoken per unit of time. Although it is not clear
how the researchers applied this device to the calculation
of conversational speaking rate, it appears that their
measurement procedures did not involve the same precision
as that used in the present study. The lack of measurement
precision may have resulted in an underestimation of
speaking rate for Block and Kellen’s participants. Interest-
ingly, the data provided by Walker et al. (1992) for AE
children aged 3 years (speaking rate = 216 spm) are
comparable to the present AuE data.1 Walker et al. sampled
20 children and performed an acoustic analysis of speaking
rate similar to the present study. To be sure, future research
examining speech rates should consider the influence of
participant sample size and measurement technique on the
calculation of overall speaking rate and articulation rate.
A second goal was to evaluate speaking rate and articula-
tion rate as a function of utterance length. It was predicted
that utterance length would be correlated with speaking rate
1The rate data for 3- and 5-year-old AE children provided by Walker et al.
(1992) were reported as being articulation rates. However, Walker et al. only
deleted silent intervals greater than 250 ms in the calculation of articulation
rate and therefore their results are more compatible with the speaking rate
data reported in the present study.

and articulation rate. Based on analysis of speech rates
across utterances varying in length from 3 to 16 syllables,
no significant correlations were found. However, upon
close evaluation of the database, significant positive
correlations were found for both speech rates across
utterances of 3 to 7 syllables in length. The relationship
between speech rates and utterance length was less
apparent for utterances beyond 7 syllables in length, as
indicated by nonsignificant negative correlations. Although
the pattern observed for utterances of 8 to 16 syllables in
length may be a reflection of a limited speech corpus, it
is interesting to consider the possibility of a plateau in the
production of conversational speech rate. In the present
study, it appeared that children demonstrated their
maximal speech rate for utterances of 7 syllables in
length.
Previous research examining speaking rate and utterance
length for young AE children was inconclusive. Amster
(1984) reported a significant correlation between utterance
length and speaking rate for children aged 2–4 years;
however, Walker et al. (1992) found no such relationship
for children aged 3–5 years. The comparable findings
between the present study and those of Amster are likely a
reflection of similarities in speech sampling. In both
studies, large numbers of utterances were collected from
each child, whereas Walker et al. (1992) collected fewer
than 10 utterances per child. Sampling a large number of
utterances may have simply provided a better representation
of the influence of utterance length on speech rate. The
significant correlations between utterance length and speech
rate would suggest that children as young as 2–4 years of
age are demonstrating patterns of speech motor control
commonly found in adults (Fonagy & Magdics, 1960;
Malecot et al., 1972).
Finally, some comments regarding the clinical applica-
bility of the present data are appropriate. Speech rate
data were shown to be clinically useful for speech-
language pathologists in the United States who work
with speech disordered clients of all ages (Hall et al.,
1999; Hammen & Yorkston, 1996; Walker, 1988;
Yorkston et al., 1999). However, the absence of available
speech rate data for other varieties of English may
severely limit clinicians in other English-speaking
countries who are charged with the diagnosis and
treatment of clients with various speech-timing disorders
(e.g., stuttering). The present body of speech rate data
for 2- to 4-year-old AuE-speaking children was relatively
small and the results, therefore, should be considered
preliminary. Still, these data may be of value to clini-
cians in Australia by providing a general baseline of
expected speaking rate and articulation rate. Large-scale
studies of AuE speech rates are clearly required, with
particular attention to the developmental (i.e., lifespan)
course of speaking rate and articulation rate. In addition,
future research needs to address the “standards” issue
more critically. If speech rate data are to be of clinical
value, the method of speech analysis (e.g., acoustic vs.
perceptual) and measurement technique (e.g., speaking
rate vs. articulation rate) need to be standardized for
each variety of spoken English.
